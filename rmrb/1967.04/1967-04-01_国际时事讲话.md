Chairman Mao teaches us: "The oppressed peoples and nations will never achieve their liberation by relying on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but only through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle can they achieve victory."

The revolutionary struggle of the Colombian people is developing steadily.

In their struggle, the Colombian people have not only established guerrilla forces but also a heroic National Liberation Army. Recently, this revolutionary armed force, in the struggle against "encirclement and suppression," has launched continuous attacks in several regions, achieving significant victories.

Not long ago, a unit of the National Liberation Army attacked a convoy of the state railway in the Carare forest region of Santander Province. The liberation army soldiers pre-placed explosives on the tracks, derailed the train after blowing up the tracks, and then opened fire on the police, killing five and wounding one, and seizing a batch of weapons. This victory of the National Liberation Army was achieved in the face of a new large-scale "encirclement and suppression" and a white terror environment by the government forces. Before launching this attack, another guerrilla unit of the National Liberation Army and a guerrilla unit of the revolutionary armed forces had already launched two attacks in late February and early March. In response, the Colombian government forces frantically mobilized thousands of troops from the army, navy, and air force, launching another large-scale anti-guerrilla offensive. They declared certain areas as "war zones," forcibly evacuating residents and creating "no-man's lands" in an attempt to cut off support for the guerrillas. However, all these efforts failed to stop the guerrillas' activities.

Over a hundred guerrillas of the National Liberation Army again launched a surprise attack on a police station near the town of Vijagua, close to Barrancabermeja in Santander Province, killing five policemen and wounding three, and seizing all the weapons and ammunition from the police station. This attack was carried out by the "Camilo Torres Guerrilla Front" of the National Liberation Army.

The guerrillas occupied the town of Vijagua for more than two hours, convening a meeting with the residents to propagate the National Liberation Army's proposals and posting numerous revolutionary slogans. According to Colombian newspapers, the distinctive feature of this attack was its "clear numerical superiority and surprise."

Following the National Liberation Army's surprise attack, a guerrilla unit of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces launched an ambush in the mountainous area near Algeciras in the province of Huila, annihilating a patrol of government forces, killing and wounding twenty government soldiers.

Meanwhile, the struggle of the urban people in Colombia has further developed. Recently, 3,700 teachers in the province of Nariño went on strike to protest the government's delay in paying their salaries. Workers of the Pacific Choco Gold Mine, a U.S.-owned company in the province of Choco, also went on strike to protest the company's racial discrimination and demand wage increases. Additionally, workers of the Pas del Rio Steel Plant, controlled by U.S. monopoly capital, and employees of the Colombian Bank in various locations, as well as public bus and truck transport workers in Bucaramanga, have also gone on strike in recent times.

The U.S. imperialists are frantically expanding the war in Vietnam.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries, the logic by which they perish inevitably."

The U.S. imperialists are frantically expanding the war in Vietnam. On March 20th and 21st, the U.S. bandit leader Johnson personally chaired a war conference on Guam. Four days later, senior U.S. military and political officials gathered in Washington to discuss specific military deployments.

The U.S. aggressors have been defeated on the battlefield in Vietnam and failed in their February "bombing halt" deception. It is in this desperate situation that the Johnson administration, driven to the wall, decided to further escalate military adventurism, hoping to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

Before the Guam conference, the U.S. aggressors had already carried out a series of "escalations" in both South and North Vietnam. After the Guam conference, they greatly accelerated the pace of war expansion. In South Vietnam, the U.S. continuously concentrated troops, intensified "sweeping operations," and repeatedly deployed B-52 bombers to bomb liberated areas. According to Western news agencies, U.S. forces in Vietnam will gradually increase to 500,000 or even 600,000, launching an "unprecedented" large-scale attack on the liberated areas. In North Vietnam, the U.S. bandits have intensified their indiscriminate bombing and threatened to further expand the bombing targets and scale. Notably, it is revealed that the Johnson administration also plans to "establish a line of defense north of the 17th parallel," preparing to invade North Vietnam and occupy the southern regions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The military adventurism planned by the U.S. imperialists in Guam is not only directed at the Vietnamese people. To meet the needs of expanding the war in Vietnam, the Johnson administration is preparing to expand the ground war to Laos and Cambodia. Starting from April 3rd, U.S. B-52 bombers will be stationed at Thai bases. The Thai government has also announced that a batch of Thai mercenary troops will soon be sent to South Vietnam. Additionally, the Johnson administration will convene meetings in Washington in April with members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the ANZUS countries, and the Vietnam war accomplices to further bind its lackeys and henchmen to the Vietnam war chariot. At the same time, U.S. imperialism continues to provoke military incidents against our country. Recently, U.S. military and political officials have repeatedly visited Taiwan to hold secret talks with the Kuomintang bandits. During the Guam conference, U.S. warships and military aircraft frequently intruded into our territorial waters and airspace. Starting from April 1st, U.S. troops in Taiwan and the Kuomintang bandit "special forces" have jointly conducted military exercises. All this indicates that U.S. imperialism is not only frantically intensifying the war in Vietnam but also preparing to expand the flames of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula, to the entire Southeast Asia, and even to China.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has once again played the shameful role of accomplice in the U.S. imperialists' war expansion. While the U.S. is intensifying military adventurism, the Soviet revisionists are engaged in dirty political deals with the U.S. and actively promoting the "peace talks" deception in collaboration with UN Secretary-General U Thant. This has greatly aided the U.S. aggressors.

However, the desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism will not reverse its failures. The heroic Vietnamese people have the power to defeat the U.S. aggressors. Since the Guam conference, victories have been reported from both South and North Vietnam; the military actions of the U.S. aggressors have been met with fierce resistance. The U.S. imperialists' continued escalation of the war can only lead to more disastrous defeats. Their frantic new military adventurism can only hasten their own doom.

The unity and anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples are unstoppable.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese idiom describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are precisely such a bunch of fools."

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in order to further curry favor with U.S. imperialism, is intensifying its evil activities of splitting the Asian and African peoples' unity and anti-imperialist movement, attempting to sabotage the unity and anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples.

The farce of the so-called "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference," orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists, was staged in Beirut, Lebanon, from March 25th to 29th. The Soviet revisionists engaged in anti-China propaganda inside and outside the conference, committing a new and serious crime of openly splitting and sabotaging the Asian and African writers' movement.

In February, the Soviet revisionists also illegally convened the so-called "Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council Meeting" in Cyprus, forcibly overturning the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year, thus openly splitting the Asian and African peoples' unity and anti-imperialist movement.

For many years, within the Asian and African writers' movement and the Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement, there has been a struggle between two lines. The vast majority of Asian and African writers and peoples have consistently and resolutely opposed imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the U.S., firmly supporting the revolutionary line of the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples. This revolutionary line has greatly promoted the unity and anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples. However, the Soviet revisionists, infiltrating the Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement, have been vigorously promoting a line of capitulation. As this line of capitulation has repeatedly suffered shameful failures, the Soviet revisionists have increasingly exposed their ugly faces as lackeys of U.S. imperialism before the Asian and African peoples.

At present, the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa are surging like a storm, fiery and intense. The revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces are becoming increasingly distinct. At this crucial historical juncture, the Soviet revisionists, who have infiltrated the Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement, brazenly carry out open splits, further exposing their traitorous nature. "A thousand sails pass by the wrecked ship, a million trees bloom before the withered tree." After the Soviet revisionists split away, the Asian and African writers' movement and the Asian and African peoples' solidarity movement will surely become more united and stronger.

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. They are more convinced than ever that the People's Republic of China, founded and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, is a stronghold of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples. The Third Asian-African Writers' Conference and the Fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference, to be held in Beijing this year, will surely push the unity and anti-imperialist movement of the Asian and African peoples to new heights.

The Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers has solemnly announced that the preparatory work for the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing is proceeding satisfactorily. The Chinese Writers' Association has expressed its determination to contribute its utmost to the successful convening of this conference. The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity has also solemnly declared that the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference has been officially established and will work with all Asian and African friends who uphold the line of unity and anti-imperialism to prepare for the conference. Revolutionary writers' organizations and solidarity organizations from various Asian and African countries have issued statements supporting the holding of the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference and the Fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference in China. The cause of Asian and African peoples' unity and anti-imperialism is advancing with unstoppable momentum. Let the Soviet revisionist traitors, who are terrified of the unity and anti-imperialist cause of the Asian and African peoples, tremble with fear!

    国际时事讲话
    哥伦比亚人民斗争深入发展
    毛主席教导我们：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    哥伦比亚人民的革命斗争正在不断发展。
    哥伦比亚人民在斗争中，不仅建立了游击队武装，而且建立一支英雄的民族解放军。最近，这支革命武装部队在反“围剿”斗争中，连续在好几个地区内袭击政府军，取得了很大胜利。
    不久前，一支民族解放军在桑坦德省卡拉雷森林地区袭击了国家铁路的一支护车队。解放军战士预先在铁轨上埋好炸药，在炸毁了铁轨和使火车出轨后，向警察开枪射击，打死警察五人，打伤一人，并缴获了一批武器。民族解放军这次出击的胜利，是在政府军的新的大规模“围剿”和白色恐怖的环境中取得的。在发动这次袭击以前，民族解放军的另一支游击队和革命武装部队的一支游击队已经分别在二月底和三月初发动过两次出击。为此，哥伦比亚政府军疯狂地出动海、陆、空三军数千人，发动了又一次大规模反游击战攻势。他们把一些地区宣布为“战争区”，强制居民撤出，制造“无人区”，妄图使游击队得不到人民的支持。但是这一切并没有能制止游击队的出击活动。
    哥伦比亚游击队的上百名游击战士又在桑坦德省奇袭了巴兰卡维梅哈附近比哈瓜尔镇的一个警察所，打死警察五人，打伤三人，缴获了警察所的全部武器弹药。这次袭击是由民族解放军的“卡米洛·托雷斯游击战线”的战士进行的。
    游击队一度占领比哈瓜尔镇两个多小时，在那里召集居民开会，宣传了民族解放军的主张，并且张贴了大批宣传革命的标语。据哥伦比亚报纸报道，这次袭击的特点是“明显的数量优势和突然袭击”。
    紧接民族解放军的这次奇袭之后，哥伦比亚革命武装部队的一支游击队在乌伊拉省山区阿尔赫西拉斯附近发动了一次伏击，歼灭了政府军的一支巡逻队，打死打伤政府军二十人。
    与此同时，哥伦比亚城市人民的斗争有了进一步的发展。最近哥伦比亚纳里尼奥省三千七百名教师罢教，抗议政府拖欠他们的工资。乔科省美资太平洋乔科金矿公司的工人也举行罢工，抗议公司当局实行种族歧视，并要求增加工资。此外，美国垄断资本控制的帕斯德里奥钢铁厂的工人和哥伦比亚银行的各地职工以及布卡拉曼加的公共汽车和汽车运输工人，不久前也都举行了罢工。
    美帝疯狂扩大侵越战争
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    美帝国主义正在疯狂地扩大侵越战争。三月二十日和二十一日，美国强盗头子约翰逊在关岛亲自主持召开了一次杀气腾腾的战争会议。四天以后，美国高级军政官员又在华盛顿集会，研究了具体的军事部署。
    美国侵略者在越南战场上被打得一败涂地，二月份搞了一次“停炸诱和”骗局又没有成功。正是在这种走投无路的情况下，约翰逊政府狗急跳墙，决定进一步扩大军事冒险，妄想迫使越南人民屈膝投降。
    在关岛会议召开之前，美国侵略者就在越南南方和北方进行了一系列的战争“升级”。关岛会议以后，它大大地加速了扩大战争的步伐。在越南南方，美国不断集结兵力，加紧“扫荡”，并且连续出动B—52型轰炸机轰炸解放区。据西方通讯社报道说，侵越美军将陆续增加到五十万甚至六十万，以“空前的规模”来向解放区大举进攻。对越南北方，美国强盗变本加厉地狂轰滥炸，并且扬言要进一步扩大轰炸目标和轰炸规模。特别值得注意的是，据透露，约翰逊政府还计划“在十七度线以北建立一条防线”，准备进攻越南北方，占领越南民主共和国的南部地区。
    美帝国主义在关岛策划的军事冒险，矛头还不仅指向越南人民。为了扩大侵越战争的需要，约翰逊政府正准备把地面战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。从四月三日起，美国B—52型轰炸机将进驻泰国基地。泰国官方还宣布，一批泰国帮凶军即将开赴越南南方。此外，约翰逊政府在四月份还要接连纠集东南亚集团、美澳新集团国家和侵越帮凶到华盛顿开会，以便把它的仆从、走卒进一步绑紧在侵越战车上。在这同时，美帝国主义还不断对我国进行军事挑衅。最近以来，美国军政要员连续到台湾同蒋匪帮密谈。关岛会议期间，美国军舰和军用飞机多次侵入我国领海领空。四月一日开始，侵台美军和台湾蒋匪军的“特种部队”又联合进行军事演习。这一切表明，美帝国主义不仅要疯狂地加强侵越战争，而且准备把侵略战火扩大到整个印度支那，扩大到整个东南亚，甚至扩大到中国。
    苏修领导集团在美帝国主义扩大战争的活动中又一次充当了可耻的帮凶。在美国加紧军事冒险的时候，苏修同美国大做其肮脏的政治交易，并且配合联合国秘书长吴丹积极推销“和谈”骗局。这就为美国侵略者帮了大忙。
    但是，美帝国主义的疯狂挣扎，决不可能挽回它的失败。英雄的越南人民完全有力量打败美国侵略者。关岛会议以来，越南南方和北方捷报频传；美国侵略者的军事行动已经遭到迎头痛击。美帝国主义继续战争“升级”，只能使自己输得更惨。它疯狂地进行新的军事冒险，除了加速自己的灭亡以外，决不可能有别的结果。
    亚非人民团结运动不可阻挡
    毛主席教导我们：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”
    苏联修正主义领导集团为了进一步投靠美帝国主义，正变本加厉地在亚非人民团结反帝运动中大搞分裂主义的罪恶活动，妄图破坏亚非人民的团结反帝斗争。
    由苏修一手策划的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的丑剧，三月二十五日到二十九日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特上演了五天。苏修在会内外大搞反华宣传，这是苏修公开分裂和破坏亚非作家运动的一个新的严重罪行。
    二月间，苏修还在塞浦路斯非法召开了所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，强行推翻了第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议，从而公开地分裂了亚非人民团结反帝运动。
    多年来，在亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结运动中，一直存在着两条路线的斗争。广大亚非作家和亚非人民一贯坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，坚决支持亚非人民民族解放斗争的革命路线。这条革命路线大大促进了亚非人民的团结反帝斗争。而混入亚非人民团结运动中的苏修，则竭力推行投降主义路线。随着这条投降主义路线不断遭到可耻的失败，苏修在亚非人民面前日益暴露了它充当美帝国主义别动队的丑恶嘴脸。
    当前亚非两大洲人民争取民族解放斗争，正风起云涌，如火如荼。革命力量和反革命力量，阵线日益分明。在这个重大历史关头，混入亚非人民团结运动的苏修，悍然实行公开分裂，这更加暴露了苏修的叛徒面目。“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。”亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结运动，在苏修分裂出去之后，必将使自己队伍更加团结，更加壮大。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，使亚非广大革命人民获得巨大鼓舞。他们更加坚信中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的中华人民共和国是亚非人民反帝斗争的强大根据地。今年将在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会和第五届亚非人民团结大会，必将把亚非人民团结反帝运动推向新的高潮。
    亚非作家常设局已庄严宣布，在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会筹备工作正在令人满意地进行。中国作家协会表示决心为这次大会的胜利召开贡献最大的力量。中国亚非团结委员会也郑重宣告，第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会已正式成立，它将和一切维护团结反帝革命路线的亚非朋友一道，进行筹备工作。亚非各国革命作家组织和亚非团结组织，纷纷发表声明，支持在中国举行第三届亚非作家大会和第五届亚非人民团结大会。亚非人民团结反帝事业正以不可阻挡之势，更加蓬勃地向前发展。让对亚非人民团结反帝事业怕得要死的苏修叛徒们去发抖吧！
