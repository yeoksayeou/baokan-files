The Ministry of National Defense issued an order, conferring the title of "Model Political Border Defense Company" on the Third Company of a certain unit in the Kunming Military Region. This is an honor for the Third Company and an inspiration to all border defense units. This order will serve as a great impetus for the broad masses of border defense units to better defend and build up the border regions.

The Third Company is one of the many border defense companies in our army. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and insisted on building a revolutionary company with Mao Zedong Thought. They have mobilized the masses and armed them with Mao Zedong Thought, establishing a solid military-civilian defense, and turning the defense area into a strong red fortress. They are a red flag on the border defense front.

The Third Company is a model in implementing Chairman Mao's people's war strategy and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in border defense construction. It is a model in executing the Central Military Commission's policy of politically building up the border defense.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The people are the decisive factor in victory. Strong revolutionary political work is a major factor in our victory over the enemy. Chairman Mao's military thought is first and foremost about building the army politically and ideologically. Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings, emphasizes that all work in the army must focus on politics. He points out: Our border defense is about building a political border defense. The Central Military Commission's policy of politically building up the border defense is a concrete application and embodiment of Chairman Mao's people's war and people's army thought. It is a correct policy to emphasize proletarian politics and fundamentally strengthen border defense construction.

Politically building up the border defense means putting politics first, emphasizing the human factor, and using ideological revolution to promote border defense construction. This is fundamentally opposed to bourgeois military thought that focuses solely on military or technical aspects.

Politically building up the border defense means fully mobilizing and organizing the masses, relying on the broad masses of the people to build and defend the border. This is completely opposite to the bourgeois military line that relies solely on military fortifications and is detached from the masses.

To build a political border defense, we must have a highly proletarianized and combat-ready border defense force. The construction of border defense units mainly involves strengthening political and ideological work, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on and addressing active thoughts, conducting thorough class education, and educating against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. We must also educate on Chairman Mao's people's war thought and the various policy directives of the Central Military Commission. At present, we must especially conduct education on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the struggle between the two lines. When politics is strengthened and people's ideological revolution is promoted, the army will have the greatest combat effectiveness. It will be able to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies in the sharp and complex border struggles and in the socialist revolution and construction in the border regions.

Chairman Mao said: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution." Only by mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of the people can we build a truly solid border defense. Border defense units must follow Chairman Mao's teachings that our army is both a fighting force and a work force and a production force. They must strengthen work among the masses, unite with the brotherly nationalities, model the implementation of national policies and border discipline, help the people "seize the revolution and promote production," do a good job in the three implementations of militia work, and strengthen military-civilian relations to achieve unity between the military and the people and good military-civilian defense. The army's work among the masses is mainly political and ideological work to raise the masses' ideological awareness. The people will regard our army as their own and see defending the border as their honorable duty. They will contribute boundless strength in border defense struggles.

Building a political border defense involves thousands of tasks, but the most fundamental is to arm the army and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide border defense struggles and production construction. We must persistently carry out the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The army must not only study well itself but also spread Mao Zedong Thought to the people and be a good propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the Third Company said well: "The more people we arm with Mao Zedong Thought, the more red sentinels we have; the more villages we arm with Mao Zedong Thought, the more red outposts we have; if we arm all the border peoples of various nationalities with Mao Zedong Thought, we will build a political border defense." Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting millions of revolutionary masses, we can build an ideological Great Wall and build the most solid border defense.

Border defense units, entrusted by the Party and the people of the motherland, guard the gates of the motherland. Their responsibility is extremely heavy. All military units, especially border defense units, must learn from the revolutionary spirit of the "Model Political Border Defense Company," resolutely implement Chairman Mao's people's war thought, and resolutely execute the Central Military Commission's policy of politically building up the border defense. We will turn our defense line into an iron wall. Any enemy that dares to invade will be decisively, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilated!

### 用毛泽东思想建设政治边防

    用毛泽东思想建设政治边防
    国防部发布命令，授予昆明部队某部三连“政治边防模范连”的称号。这是三连的光荣，也是对所有边防部队的鼓舞。这个命令将成为推动广大边防部队更好地保卫边疆、建设边疆的巨大力量。
    三连是我军许许多多边防连队中的一个。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持用毛泽东思想建设革命化连队，用毛泽东思想发动群众和武装群众，建立巩固的军民联防，把防区建成了坚强的红色堡垒。他们是边防战线上的一面红旗。
    三连是在边防建设中贯彻毛主席的人民战争思想，在边防建设中贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的模范，是执行中央军委从政治上建设边防的方针的模范。
    毛主席教导我们：兵民是胜利之本。强有力的革命的政治工作，这是我们战胜敌人的重大因素。毛主席的建军思想，首先是从政治上思想上建军。林彪同志根据毛主席的历来教导，强调部队的一切工作都要突出政治。他指出：我们的边防是搞政治边防。中央军委制定的从政治上建设边防的方针，就是毛主席的人民战争、人民军队思想的具体运用和体现，是突出无产阶级政治，从根本上加强边防建设的正确方针。
    从政治上建设边防，是把政治放在首位，坚持人的因素第一，以人的思想革命化推动边防建设。这同单纯军事观点、单纯技术观点等等资产阶级军事思想是根本对立的。
    从政治上建设边防，是把人民群众充分发动起来，组织起来，依靠广大人民群众建设和保卫边防。这同单纯依靠军事设防，脱离人民群众的资产阶级军事路线是完全相反的。
    建设政治边防，必须有一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的边防部队。边防部队的建设，主要是加强政治思想工作，活学活用毛主席著作，大抓狠抓活思想，认真进行阶级教育，进行反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的教育，进行毛主席的人民战争思想的教育，进行中央军委各项政策指示的教育。在当前，特别要进行无产阶级文化大革命的教育，进行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的教育，进行两条路线斗争的教育。政治加强了，促进了人的思想革命化，部队就有了最大的战斗力，就能在尖锐复杂的边防斗争中，在边疆社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人。
    毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”只有把广大人民群众动员起来，组织起来，才能建设真正巩固的边防。边防部队必须遵照毛主席关于我军既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队、生产队的教导，切实加强群众工作。团结兄弟民族，模范地执行民族政策和边防纪律，帮助人民群众“抓革命，促生产”，搞好民兵工作三落实，密切军民关系，做到军民一心，搞好军民联防。部队做群众工作，主要的也是做群众的政治思想工作，提高群众的思想觉悟。人民群众把我军看做是自己的军队，把保卫边疆当作自己的光荣职责，他们就会在边防斗争中贡献出无穷无尽的力量。
    建设政治边防，有千件事万件事要做，最根本的，是要用毛泽东思想武装部队，武装群众，用毛泽东思想指导边防斗争和生产建设。要坚持不懈地开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动。部队不仅自己要学好，而且要向人民群众传播毛泽东思想，当好毛泽东思想宣传队。三连的同志们说得好：“用毛泽东思想多武装一个群众，就多一个红色哨兵；用毛泽东思想多武装一个寨子，就多一个红色哨所；用毛泽东思想武装了所有的边疆各族人民，就建成了政治边防。”在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，团结起千百万革命群众，就能在政治上思想上筑起一道万里长城，建设起最巩固的边防。
    边防部队，受党和祖国人民的委托，守卫祖国的大门，责任非常重大。全军部队，特别是边防部队，要学习“政治边防模范连”的革命精神，坚决贯彻毛主席的人民战争思想，坚决执行中央军委从政治上建设边防的方针，把我们的国防线筑成铜墙铁壁。任何敌人胆敢来犯，就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地予以歼灭！
