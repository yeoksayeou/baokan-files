The military and civilians of Quang Tri and Thua Thien in South Vietnam have unleashed the invincible power of people's war, severely punishing the American aggressors and achieving brilliant victories.

They have also destroyed 14 enemy long-range cannons, shot down 19 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged 25 enemy armored vehicles.

The armed forces of Quang Tri Province, to punish the American aggressors who have been shelling North Vietnam, launched fierce attacks on the American long-range cannon positions and the bases of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Yu Ling area from March 1 to March 4. As a result, they annihilated and severely crippled nearly five companies of American aggressors, killing and wounding over 800 American aggressors, damaging five enemy vehicles, shooting down three enemy aircraft, and destroying multiple enemy cannons.
