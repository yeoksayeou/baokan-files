Nearly in the past few months, the Soviet revisionist leadership has closely collaborated with American imperialism, engaging in counter-revolutionary "holy alliances" in Asia, and frantically piecing together an anti-China "encirclement." The Soviet revisionist leadership has completely discarded the cover that hid their traitorous faces, openly colluding with the big and small lackeys, servants, and puppets of American imperialism in Asia, serving American imperialism, and engaging in anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil deeds.

	Actively promoting European "detente" to assist the U.S. in Vietnam
	The Soviet revisionist leadership has actively collaborated with American imperialism in shifting its global strategic focus from Europe to Asia. Recently, while engaging in European "detente" with American imperialism to facilitate the transfer of troops and the escalation of the Vietnam War, it has also been vigorously assisting American imperialism in implementing its "bombing to negotiate" and "bombing to force negotiation" schemes in Vietnam. It is well known that American imperialism's continuous escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam is not only directed against the Vietnamese people but also against the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership's frenzied assistance to American imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam is aimed at countering China. This is a component of the anti-China "encirclement" jointly operated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	Supporting the wavering Indian reactionaries
	The Indian reactionaries are loyal anti-China running dogs cultivated by the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists over the years. To maintain the decaying rule of the wavering Indian reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists have been competing to support them politically, militarily, and economically.

	At the end of February this year, after the U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific, Admiral Conway, visited India to plan military expansion for the Indian reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist leadership promptly sent a military delegation led by the First Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces, Marshal Zakharov, to India. They held consecutive talks with Indian Defense Minister Singh and the chiefs of the Indian armed forces, "reviewing the quality of weapons delivered to India over the past few years" and "discussing various suggestions for modification" made by the Indian armed forces. Zakharov also "shared his impressions of various defensive (military) facilities he visited during his stay in this country," providing strategic advice for the Indian reactionaries' military expansion. At the end of last year, "when the U.S. was trying to persuade other countries to help meet India's urgent need for more grain," the Soviet revisionist leadership immediately responded, generously donating twenty million tons of wheat to the Indian reactionaries and rushing to deliver it free of charge. The care was indeed meticulous.

	Selling out national interests to collude with Japanese militarists
	The Soviet revisionist leadership has long been on intimate terms with the loyal lackeys of American imperialism, the Japanese militarists. Recently, as American imperialism has further drawn and incited the Japanese reactionaries to serve its policy of aggression and war in Asia, the Soviet revisionist leadership has even been willing to sell out national interests to tightly collude with the Sato government in Japan. It is reported that there has been a constant exchange of important officials between Moscow and Tokyo. Following the mutual visits of Gromyko and Shigemitsu last year, the Soviet-Japanese ministerial-level consultations will be held again this September. After signing the fisheries agreement and consular agreement, on January 20 this year, they also signed a contract for joint operation of the Tokyo-Moscow air route. The Soviet revisionist leadership has openly allowed Japanese militarists to use the Siberian airspace, which has never been opened to foreign airlines. According to the then Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Japan "never expected the Soviet Union to concede to this extent." The Soviet revisionist leadership has also shown "almost unbelievable enthusiasm" for Soviet-Japanese trade, increasing the trade volume by more than a hundred times compared to ten years ago. The Soviet revisionist leadership has also "opened the door to thieves," courting Japanese monopolistic capital to invest in large-scale development in Siberia. Japanese bourgeois newspapers proudly said that the Soviet Union's approach of "leaning towards" Japan is "rare in the world."

	Boosting and sustaining the Indonesian fascist regime
	The Soviet revisionist leadership and American imperialism have recently been even more closely coordinated in vigorously supporting the right-wing military regime in Indonesia. Both sides have spared no effort to boost and sustain the Suharto regime. The Soviet revisionist leadership openly echoed American imperialism, cheering for the right-wing military regime's anti-China and anti-communist actions, labeling the fascist leaders of Indonesia as "national leaders" and "revolutionary leaders." The Soviet revisionists even specially invited the foreign minister of this bloody ruling clique, Malik, to Moscow, treating him as an honored guest, rewarding him for his anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people crimes. Recently, to maintain the precarious Indonesian fascist regime, the U.S. decided to provide it with an additional $80 million in "aid" this year and prepare to resume all "military aid" to Indonesia. After continuing to provide "military aid" to the Indonesian reactionary regime, the Soviet revisionists also agreed to allow it to defer the repayment of a debt amounting to $1.2 billion. At the end of last year, the Suharto regime, in an even more brazen betrayal of national interests, publicly announced its welcome to foreign capital to enter Indonesia for exploitation. The U.S. quickly signed an agreement with it, giving American monopolistic capital the privilege of plundering and exploiting in Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist group was not to be outdone, recently expressing through its trade representative office officials in Jakarta its willingness to invest in Indonesia according to Indonesia's "foreign investment" law.

	Colluding with "Malaysia" to attempt to "contain" China
	The Soviet revisionist leadership has also openly colluded with the new colonialist product "Malaysia," which was created by American and British imperialism, sending a "trade delegation" to sign a trade agreement with the "Malaysian" reactionary authorities, preparing to establish "normal diplomatic relations," and expressing the desire to emulate the U.S. in sending a "Peace Corps" to "Malaysia." The leader of the Soviet "trade delegation" openly shouted in Kuala Lumpur that the Soviet revisionist leadership has "common interests" with "Malaysia." According to "Malaysia's" Prime Minister Rahman, the "common interests" of the Soviet-Malaysian collusion also lie in "producing an effect of containing China." This reveals the evil anti-China deeds of the Soviet revisionists.

	The Soviet revisionist leaders are the number one accomplices of American imperialism. It is not surprising that they collude with the big and small lackeys of American imperialism in Asia. However, the counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" and anti-China "encirclement" carefully nurtured by the Soviet revisionist leaders and American imperialism will not harm a single hair of the great new China, nor will they block the surging revolutionary tide of the Asian people. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand forever with the people of Asia and the people of the world. This is something that no reactionary forces can "isolate" or "encircle." On the contrary, the counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" and anti-China "encirclement" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are precisely the nooses that American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionary cliques of various countries have placed around their own necks. The farther the Soviet revisionist leadership walks down the path of anti-China, anti-communism, anti-people, and counter-revolution, the closer they come to the grave.

    与白宫老板打得火热　和美帝走狗同流合污
    苏修加紧在亚洲拼凑反华“包围圈”
    苏修沿着反华反共反革命道路走得越远就越接近坟墓
    新华社十八日讯　近几个月来，苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义紧密配合，在亚洲大搞他们的反革命“神圣同盟”，极力拼凑反华“包围圈”。苏修领导集团已完全抛掉掩饰自己叛徒面目的遮羞布，公然同美帝国主义在亚洲的大小走狗、仆从、傀儡勾结在一起，为美帝国主义效劳，进行反华、反共、反人民、反革命的罪恶勾当。
    大搞欧洲“缓和”为美帝侵越帮忙
    苏修领导集团积极配合美帝国主义把它的全球战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲，近来，一面和美帝国主义大搞欧洲局势“缓和”，以便美帝国主义从欧洲调兵遣将，放手扩大侵越战争；一面极力帮助美帝国主义在越南实现“停炸诱和”和“以炸迫和”的阴谋。人所共知，美帝国主义不断扩大侵略越南的战争，不仅是针对越南人民的，也是针对东南亚各国人民，针对中国人民的。苏修领导集团如此疯狂地为美帝国主义的侵越战争效劳，目的之一就是为了反华，这是美苏共同经营的反华“包围圈”的组成部分。
    替风雨飘摇中的印度反动派撑腰
    印度反动派是苏修和美帝多年来竭力培植的忠实反华走卒。为了维持风雨飘摇中的印度反动派的腐朽统治，苏修和美帝竞相在政治、军事和经济上为印度反动派撑腰。
    今年二月底，在美国进击司令部总司令康韦到印度为印度反动派策划扩军备战之后，苏修领导集团紧跟着也派了以苏联国防部第一副部长、陆海军总参谋长扎哈罗夫为首的军事代表团到印度，同印度国防部长辛格、印度三军参谋长等接连举行会谈，“研究了（苏联）过去几年内运交印度的武器的质量”，“讨论了印度武装部队提出的种种修改的建议”，扎哈罗夫还“向他们说明了他对于他在这个国家访问期间参观过的各种防御（军事）设施的印象”，为印度反动派扩军备战出谋划策。去年年底，“正当美国力图促使其它国家帮助它满足印度对更多粮食的迫切需要”时，苏修领导集团立即响应，大慷苏联人民之慨，赠送给印度反动派二十万吨小麦，并急如星火地免费运去。真是关怀备至。
    出卖民族利益同日本军国主义勾搭
    苏修领导集团同美帝国主义的忠实奴仆日本军国主义者，早已打得火热。近来，随着美帝国主义进一步拉拢和唆使日本反动派为其在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策效劳，苏修领导集团甚至不惜出卖民族利益同日本佐藤政府加紧实行全面勾结。据报道，莫斯科和东京之间重要官员的来往络绎不绝，继葛罗米柯和椎名悦三郎去年互访之后，苏日部长级官员定期协商会议又将在今年九月举行。苏日在签订渔业协定、领事协定之后，今年一月二十日又签订了苏日共同经营东京—莫斯科航线的合同。苏修领导集团公然向日本军国主义者开放了从未向外国航空公司开放的西伯利亚上空。据当时的日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎说：日本“完全没有想到苏联会让步到这种程度”。苏修领导集团对于苏日贸易也“拿出了几乎令人难以置信的热情”，使贸易额比十年前增加了一百多倍。苏修领导集团还“开门揖盗”，拉拢日本垄断资本投资大规模开发西伯利亚。日本资产阶级报纸得意地说，苏联如此“靠拢”日本的做法，“在世界上还是稀有的”。
    为印尼法西斯政权打气输血
    苏联修正主义领导集团和美帝国主义，在大力扶植印尼右派军人政权方面，近来配合得更为紧密。双方不遗余力地给苏哈托政权打气，输血。苏修领导集团公然同美帝国主义一个腔调，为右派军人政权的反华、反共叫好，把印尼的法西斯头目称为“民族领袖”、“革命领导人”。苏修还特地把这个血腥统治集团的外交部长马利克请到莫斯科，奉为上宾，为它的反华、反共、反人民罪行行功犒赏。最近，为了维持岌岌可危的印尼法西斯政权，美帝决定今年内再给它提供八千万美元的“援助”，并准备恢复对印尼的一切“军事援助”。苏修在继续给予印尼反动政权“军事援助”之后，又答应让它延期偿还为数达十二亿美元的债款。去年年底，苏哈托政权变本加厉地出卖民族利益，公然宣布欢迎外国资本渗入印尼进行剥削。美国捷足先登，马上同它签订了一项协定，使美国垄断资本取得在印尼进行掠夺和剥削的特权。苏修集团也不甘落后，最近，通过它在雅加达的商务代表机构官员，表示愿意根据印尼的“外国投资”法令在印尼投资。
    勾结“马来西亚”妄想“遏制”中国
    苏修领导集团同美英帝国主义一手炮制出来的新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”，也公开同流合污，派出“贸易代表团”同“马来西亚”反动当局签订贸易协定，筹备建立“正常外交关系”，并表示要模仿美国向“马来西亚”派遣“和平队”。苏修“贸易代表团”团长在吉隆坡公然叫嚷苏修领导集团同“马来西亚”有“共同利益”。据“马来西亚”的总理拉赫曼透露，苏马勾结的“共同利益”也在于“将产生对中国遏制的效果”。这就一语道破了苏修反华的罪恶勾当。
    苏修领导人是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，他们和美帝国主义在亚洲的大大小小的走狗勾结在一起，这是毫不奇怪的。但是苏修领导人和美帝国主义所苦心经营的反革命“神圣同盟”、反华“包围圈”，绝损伤不了伟大的新中国的一根毫毛，绝阻挡不住亚洲人民汹涌澎湃的革命浪潮。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，同亚洲人民、同全世界人民是永远站在一起的，这是任何反动势力也“孤立”不了和“包围”不住的。恰恰相反，苏美反革命“神圣同盟”、反华“包围圈”，却正是美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和各国反动派自己套在自己脖子上的一条绞索。苏修领导集团沿着反华、反共、反人民、反革命的路走得越远，就越接近坟墓。
