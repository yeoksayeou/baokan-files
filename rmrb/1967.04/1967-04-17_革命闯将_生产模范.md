In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary vanguard of China's working class has responded most resolutely to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They are striving even harder, vying for the top, and aiming to become "the most outstanding model of the nationwide laboring masses in seizing the revolution and promoting production in the current stage." Revolutionary vanguard and production expert Xie Yue from Taiyuan Textile Factory is one such model.

Before the seizure of power, amidst the class struggle, Xie Yue did not fall for deception or fear pressure. She led her revolutionary comrades to always stay at their posts and make revolution. At the critical moment of seizing power, she stepped forward and, together with her comrades, charged into battle, seizing the factory's power back into their hands. After the revolutionary faction took power, she resolutely returned to the workshop, blending in with the masses, and actively seizing the revolution and promoting production.

Xie Yue was able to do this because she listens to Chairman Mao the most, understands the great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" the best, and executes this policy the most resolutely. She understands that revolution must lead, must take the helm, and must promote production. She also understands that revolution and production are both indispensable, and that production must not be slackened while seizing the revolution. Xie Yue's consistent actions during the Cultural Revolution show that she truly understands the principle that revolution and production must not be neglected, but also cannot be treated as equal.

Precisely because she truly understands this principle, after the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power and after she became a leader of the revolutionary organization and revolutionary committee, Xie Yue proactively returned to the workshop, placing her work focus on the production frontline. In this way, she could be more closely connected with the masses, better understand the masses' revolutionary demands, and further shoulder the two heavy burdens of revolution and production.

### 革命闯将　生产模范

    革命闯将　生产模范
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国工人阶级的革命派战士，最坚决地响应毛主席和党中央的号召，正在更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取成为“现阶段全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范”。太原纺织厂的革命闯将、生产能手解悦同志，就是这样的模范之一。
    在夺权以前的阶级斗争风浪中，解悦同志不受骗，不怕压，带动革命派战友，始终坚守岗位闹革命；在夺权的关键时刻，她挺身而出，跟战友们一起冲锋陷阵，把工厂的大权一举夺回到手里；在革命派掌权后，她又坚决地返回车间，和群众打成一片，积极地抓革命、促生产。
    解悦同志能够做到这一点，就是因为她最听毛主席的话，最理解“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，最坚决执行这个方针。她既懂得要用革命来带头，来挂帅，来促进生产，也懂得革命和生产两者缺一不可，在抓革命中也绝不能放松生产。解悦同志在文化大革命中的一贯行动，表明她真正懂得革命和生产必须两不误，而又不能等量齐观的道理。
    正因为真正懂得这个道理，在无产阶级革命派夺权后，在自己成为革命组织和革命委员会负责人后，解悦同志又主动地返回车间，把自己的工作重点放到生产第一线。这样，她就能更密切地联系群众，更清楚地理解群众的革命要求，进一步挑好革命和生产两副重担子。
