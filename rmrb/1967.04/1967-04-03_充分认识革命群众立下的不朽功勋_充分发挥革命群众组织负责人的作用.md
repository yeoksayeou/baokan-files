In the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, how can revolutionary cadres play a core and backbone role? Fully recognize the immortal achievements of revolutionary masses. Fully play the role of leaders of revolutionary mass organizations.

Shanghai, April 2 (Xinhua) — In the current struggle to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and seize power, how revolutionary cadres should correctly treat those who truly represent the broad masses of revolutionary mass organizations is a major issue. It relates to whether the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination can be genuinely implemented and whether, after seizing power, the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao can be continued. Recently, some revolutionary cadres from districts, counties, and enterprises in Shanghai that have already seized power or are in the process of seizing power held a discussion on this issue.

Participants in the discussion included Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee Chairman and former District Chief Wang Zihua, Longning District Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Committee Chairman and former Deputy District Chief Hu Huacheng, Chuansha County Revolutionary Committee Vice Chairman and former Deputy County Chief Zhang Zhenshan, Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Committee leader and former Deputy Bureau Chief Yan Hao, Shanghai First Steel Plant Revolutionary Committee Chairman and former Deputy Plant Chief Cong Jie, and Shanghai Food Company Revolutionary Committee leader and former Party Committee Secretary Wang Kun.

The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion unanimously emphasized: In the current struggle to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and seize power, we must oppose the anarchist trend of excluding and overthrowing everything. We must also prevent non-revolutionary cadres from being forcibly included in the "three-in-one" temporary power organs. At the same time, we must guard against the tendency to ignore the role of those who truly represent the broad masses of revolutionary mass organizations and exclude them in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Revolutionary cadres must fully recognize the immortal achievements of revolutionary mass organizations in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fully appreciate the significant role of revolutionary mass organization leaders in seizing and holding power. After seizing power, revolutionary cadres must more consciously and firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, work closely with revolutionary mass organization leaders, learn from them seriously, and follow the mass line in work. Only in this way can revolutionary cadres fully play their core and backbone role in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

Different attitudes towards revolutionary mass organization leaders reflect the struggle between two lines.

The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion pointed out that in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they had, to varying degrees, committed errors in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. Through the criticism and education of the masses, they returned to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In the discussion, they reviewed their changes in thought and believed that this great revolutionary mass movement had given them a great education. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao had saved them. They had a deeper understanding of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They said: Looking back at the eight months of the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines has always been centered on the fundamental issue of how to treat the masses. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is to trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, mobilize the masses, and let the masses educate and liberate themselves. The bourgeois reactionary line, on the other hand, does the opposite: it does not believe in the masses, does not rely on the masses, and adopts a Kuomintang "tutelage" attitude, treating the masses as "puppets" and imposing bourgeois dictatorship on the revolutionary masses. In the past, we made mistakes in this fundamental issue of how to treat the masses because we did not seriously understand and implement Chairman Mao's repeated admonitions about the mass line, standing on the opposite side of the masses and committing line errors. Now that the bourgeois reactionary line has been criticized, its poison has not been completely eliminated. Currently, in implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, how to treat those who truly represent the broad masses of revolutionary mass organization leaders is, in essence, a reflection of the struggle between the two lines.

They said: In the struggle to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and seize power, if someone seizes on some shortcomings and errors of revolutionary mass organizations and their leaders, does not look at their overall direction, deliberately downgrades them, and even excludes them from the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, treating them as mere "decorations" in the "three-in-one" combination, this is absolutely wrong.

They said: Revolutionary mass organization leaders are representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. In the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, the attitude of revolutionary cadres towards revolutionary mass organization leaders is a major issue of whether they support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and whether they support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Denying the position of revolutionary mass organization leaders in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination is to deny the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution. This is a question of whether one will commit the error of the bourgeois reactionary line again and is a fundamental question of whether a cadre is a true revolutionary or a false one. Revolutionary cadres must remember the lessons of this Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant. Not understanding this point means not obtaining even the most basic knowledge." We must take these teachings as our lifelong motto.

Revolutionary cadres can only rely on the broad masses to fully play their core and backbone role in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion said: The fifth issue of the Red Flag magazine editorial points out: The broad revolutionary masses are the foundation for the revolutionary masses to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and are the foundation for the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs. This is an indisputable truth. In the "three-in-one" combination, revolutionary cadres can only rely on the broad masses to fully play their core and backbone role.

They said: In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of new revolutionary mass representatives have emerged. They are the new forces nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao, with clear banners, daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize, and enjoying high prestige among the masses. Without the participation of those who truly represent the broad masses of revolutionary mass organization leaders in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, it is impossible to talk about the revolutionary nature, representativeness, and proletarian authority of the temporary power organs.

They said: In the "three-in-one" temporary power organs, revolutionary cadres should respect revolutionary mass organization leaders and work closely with them. In all work, they should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and insist on implementing the mass line, combining the enthusiasm of cadres with the enthusiasm of the masses. Only in this way can revolutionary cadres fully play their core and backbone role.

Fully appreciate the immortal achievements of the revolutionary masses and enthusiastically help them overcome their shortcomings.

To correctly treat revolutionary mass organization leaders, it is very important to fully appreciate their immortal achievements in this Cultural Revolution and to correctly view their shortcomings and errors. The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion unanimously believed: True proletarian revolutionaries and new representatives of the revolutionary masses have made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified," struggled hard, and exposed a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; they have firmly defended the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and carried out a thorough criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line; in the January Revolution storm, they timely exposed and thwarted the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp revolution, promote production," and smashed the rampant attack of counter-revolutionary economism; they implemented revolutionary great unity and carried out the struggle to seize power from the bottom up, firmly grasping the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the fate of the socialist economy in their own hands. Many issues that had not been resolved for many years were resolved by them. If there had been no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and no proletarian revolutionaries to rebel, the time bombs of revisionism buried in the revolutionary ranks would not have been dug out, proletarian power would have been handed over to the bourgeoisie, and China would have changed color. Not seeing this point is to deny the revolutionary masses and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion said: In the movement, we also received the scrutiny and criticism of the revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionaries, with deep proletarian feelings, wanted to "criticize us into the leftist camp," giving us a profound education. To be honest, without the help of the proletarian revolutionaries, we would not have quickly returned to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionaries' daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize, their great public-spirited revolutionary spirit, deeply educated us. They listen to Chairman Mao the most, showing unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. They are indeed the new forces nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must fully recognize this and humbly learn from them.

They believed: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement. It is inevitable and not difficult to correct that true proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary mass organization leaders have some shortcomings and errors in the movement. This is a problem of one finger among ten, a problem of progress. We should first see their mainstream and essence, see their revolutionary direction, and enthusiastically help them overcome their shortcomings and errors, so that they can better grasp the Party's policies and quickly mature politically.

Break with selfishness, reform worldview, and never deviate from the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

In the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, how can the role of those who truly represent the broad masses of revolutionary mass organization leaders be fully played? The revolutionary cadres participating in the discussion believed: To solve this problem, it is not only necessary to solve it organizationally and institutionally, ensuring the position of revolutionary mass organization leaders in the "three-in-one" temporary power organs and firmly implementing the democratic centralism emphasized by Chairman Mao. The most fundamental thing is to solve it ideologically. We revolutionary cadres must break with selfishness and thoroughly reform our worldview. The bourgeois "self" is the ideological root of the reactionary line. The process of implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the process of overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts and breaking with selfishness to establish a worldview of selflessness for the proletariat. If the "self" is not eliminated and the proletarian worldview of selflessness is not established, it will be impossible to correctly understand and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and it will be impossible to establish a genuine "three-in-one" combination based on revolutionary masses. Therefore, revolutionary cadres must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, consciously, seriously, and continuously reform their worldview. This is a fundamental issue that cannot be avoided. Especially for revolutionary cadres participating in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, their tasks are more arduous, their responsibilities are heavier, and they need to accelerate their ideological revolution more urgently. They should take their participation in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination as a starting point for further self-reform, revolutionize for a lifetime, reform for a lifetime, and truly arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought to live up to Chairman Mao's and the revolutionary masses' earnest expectations.

They said: In the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, fully playing the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders is not a matter of method but a matter of stance. Those who stand on the stance of the bourgeois reactionary line, standing above the masses or opposing the masses, will never believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. On the contrary, they will only treat the masses as "puppets" and criticize the masses for their shortcomings in trivial matters. Revolutionary cadres can only jump out of "self," thoroughly reform their worldview, stand on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have deep class feelings for the masses, and always be heart-to-heart with the masses. Only in this way can revolutionary cadres see the great socialist enthusiasm and boundless creativity hidden among the masses. Only in this way can revolutionary cadres put down their arrogance and humbly become students of the masses. The revolutionary cadres present unanimously expressed that they would continuously break with selfishness, thoroughly reform their worldview, and forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on political leadership, go to the masses, and be with the masses, never deviating from the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

    在革命的“三结合”中革命领导干部怎样才能起到核心和骨干作用？
    充分认识革命群众立下的不朽功勋
    充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用
    上海部分革命领导干部举行座谈。他们强调指出，在夺权以后，革命领导干部一定要更自觉、更坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，同革命群众组织负责人密切合作，认真地向他们学习，走群众路线。
    新华社上海二日电　在当前实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权的斗争中，革命的领导干部应该如何正确地对待真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人，这是关系到能否实行真正的革命的“三结合”，关系到夺权以后能否继续贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的重大问题。最近，上海一些已经夺权和正在夺权的区、县和企业单位的革命领导干部，就这一问题进行了座谈。
    参加座谈会的，有黄浦区革命委员会主任、原区长王子华，长宁区革命委员会筹委会主任、原副区长胡华清，川沙县革命委员会副主任、原副县长张震言，仪表电讯工业局革命委员会筹委会负责人、原副局长严浩，上海第一钢铁厂革命委员会主任、原副厂长丛杰，上海市食品公司革命委员会负责人、原党委书记王坤等同志。
    参加座谈会的革命领导干部一致强调指出：在当前实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权斗争中，既要反对排斥一切、打倒一切的无政府主义思潮，也要防止把并非真正的革命领导干部硬拉入“三结合”临时权力机构，同时要注意那些忽视真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人的作用，在革命的“三结合”中排斥他们的错误倾向。革命领导干部一定要充分认识革命群众组织在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的不朽功勋，充分估价革命群众组织负责人在夺权、掌权中的重大作用。在夺权以后，革命领导干部一定要更自觉、更坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，同革命群众组织负责人密切合作，认真地向他们学习，在工作中走群众路线，充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用，只有这样，才能充分发挥革命领导干部在革命的“三结合”中的核心作用和骨干作用。
    对待革命群众组织负责人的不同态度，是两条路线斗争的反映
    参加座谈会的革命领导干部，在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，都曾程度不同地犯过执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。他们经过群众的批评教育，回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们在座谈中，回顾自己思想的转变，认为这次轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动给自己很大教育，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线挽救了自己。他们对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线有了更加深切的感受。他们说：回顾八个月来的文化大革命，两条路线的斗争一直是围绕着如何对待群众这个根本问题上展开的。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线是：信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，放手发动群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己；而资产阶级反动路线则反其道而行之：不相信群众，不依靠群众，摆出一副国民党“训政”的面孔，把群众当“阿斗”，对革命群众实行资产阶级专政。过去我们正是由于没有认真领会和实行毛主席所一再告诫的群众路线，在对待群众这个根本问题上，站错了队，站到了群众的对立面，犯了路线的错误。现在资产阶级反动路线受到了批判，但它的遗毒并没有彻底清除。当前，在实行革命的“三结合”中，如何对待真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人的态度问题，从根本上说，仍然是两条路线斗争的反映。
    他们说：在实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权斗争中，如果有人抓住一些革命群众组织及其负责人的某些缺点、错误，不看他们的大方向，有意贬低他们，甚至排斥他们在革命的“三结合”中的地位，把他们当作“三结合”的“陪衬”，这是绝对错误的。
    他们说：革命群众组织负责人是革命群众组织的代表。在革命的“三结合”中，革命的领导干部对待革命群众组织负责人的态度，是对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线抱什么态度的重大问题，是对文化大革命抱什么态度的重大问题。否定革命群众组织负责人在革命的“三结合”中的地位，就是否定文化大革命的伟大成果。这是关系到会不会重犯资产阶级反动路线错误的问题，是考验领导干部是真革命还是假革命的根本问题。革命的领导干部一定要牢记这次文化大革命的教训，牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们要把这些教导当作终身的座右铭。
    革命领导干部只有依靠广大群众，才能在革命的“三结合”中充分发挥核心和骨干作用
    参加座谈会的革命领导干部在座谈中说：《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出：广大革命群众，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的基础，是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础。这是千真万确的真理。革命领导干部在“三结合”中只有依靠广大群众，才能充分发挥自己的核心作用和骨干作用。
    他们说：在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，涌现了大批新起的革命群众的代表人物。他们是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量，他们最听毛主席的话，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命，在群众中享有很高的威信。没有真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人参加革命的“三结合”，就谈不上临时权力机构的革命性、代表性和无产阶级权威性。
    他们说：革命领导干部在“三结合”的临时权力机构中，应该尊重革命群众组织负责人，和他们亲密合作，在各项工作中都要遵循毛主席的教导，坚持执行群众路线，把领导干部的积极性和群众的积极性结合在一起，只有这样才能充分发挥革命领导干部的核心和骨干作用。
    充分估价革命群众的不朽功勋，热情帮助他们克服缺点
    要正确地对待革命群众组织负责人，很重要的一点是充分估计他们在这场文化大革命中立下的不朽功勋和正确看待他们的缺点和错误。参加座谈的革命领导干部一致认为：真正的无产阶级革命派，新起的革命群众的代表人物，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，他们高举“造反有理”的大旗，经过艰苦的斗争，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；他们坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，对资产阶级反动路线进行了彻底的批判；在“一月革命”风暴中，他们及时识破了和揭穿了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，粉碎了反革命经济主义的猖狂进攻；他们实行革命的大联合，自下而上地展开夺权斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手里。多少年来解决不了的事，他们解决了。如果没有无产阶级文化大革命，没有无产阶级革命派起来造反，埋在革命队伍中的修正主义定时炸弹就挖不出来，无产阶级的政权就要交给资产阶级，中国就要改变颜色。不看到这一点，就是否定革命群众，否定无产阶级文化大革命。
    参加座谈的革命领导干部说：我们在运动中也受到了革命群众的审查和批评，无产阶级革命派带着深厚的无产阶级感情要把我们“打（批评）成左派”，使我们受到极其深刻的教育。老实说，如果没有无产阶级革命派的帮助，我们不会迅速回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。无产阶级革命派敢想敢说敢闯敢干敢革命的大公无私的革命精神深深教育了我们，他们最听毛主席的话，对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚。他们不愧是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量，是无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。我们一定要充分认识这一点，虚心地向他们学习。
    他们认为：无产阶级文化大革命是一场史无前例的轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动，真正的无产阶级革命派和革命群众组织负责人在运动中出现一些缺点和错误，这是难免的，也是不难纠正的，是十个指头中一个指头的问题，是前进中的问题。我们应该首先看到他们的主流和本质，看到他们的革命的大方向，对他们的缺点和错误要满腔热情地给以帮助，使他们更好地掌握党的方针政策，在政治上更快地成熟起来。
    破私立公，改造世界观，一刻也不离开以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线
    在革命的“三结合”中，怎样才能充分发挥真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人的作用呢？参加座谈会的革命领导干部认为：要解决这个问题，不仅要从组织上和制度上加以解决，保证革命群众组织负责人在“三结合”临时权力机构中应有的地位，坚决执行毛主席所一再强调的民主集中制，但最根本的是要从思想上解决。我们革命领导干部要破私立公，彻底改造世界观。资产阶级的“私”字，是反动路线的思想根源。贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的过程，就是克服各种非无产阶级思想的过程，就是破私立公的过程。“私”字不破除，无产阶级的一心为公的世界观不树立，就不可能很好地理解和正确执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就不可能建立真正以革命群众为基础的“三结合”。因此，革命领导干部必须以毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地、认真地、不断地改造自己的世界观，这是一个不能回避的根本问题。特别是参加了革命的“三结合”的革命领导干部，面前的任务更艰巨，肩上的担子更重，更迫切需要加速思想革命化，应该把参加革命的“三结合”作为进一步实现自我改造的起点，革命一辈子，改造一辈子，真正做到用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来，才能不辜负毛主席和革命群众的殷切期望。
    他们说：在革命的“三结合”中，充分发挥革命群众组织负责人的作用，决不是方法问题，而是一个立场问题。站在资产阶级反动路线立场上的人，站在群众之上，或者站在群众的对立面，他们永远也不会相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，相反，只会把群众当作“阿斗”，抓住群众在枝节问题上的某些缺点而加以百般指责。革命的领导干部只有从“我”字里跳出来，彻底改造世界观，才能站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，才能对群众具有深厚的阶级感情，永远同群众心连心，才能看到群众中间蕴藏着的极大的社会主义积极性和无限的创造力。也只有这样，革命的领导干部才能放下臭架子，甘当群众的小学生。到会的革命干部们一致表示，要不断破私立公，彻底改造世界观，永远遵循毛主席的教导，坚持政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，一刻也不离开以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
