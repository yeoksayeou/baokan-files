The patriotic forces of Congo (Leopoldville) have consistently adhered to the correct direction of achieving genuine national independence through armed struggle. They have learned from war in war, continuously summarized experiences, and continued to advance, seizing new victories.

The flames of the armed struggle of the Congolese people against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys were ignited by the patriotic armed forces led by Mulele in the western Kwilu region in early 1964. Subsequently, the flames of this just war spread to the eastern and northeastern regions.

U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have "encircled and suppressed" these people's armed forces for more than three years, using every brutal and vicious means, including dispatching the U.N. forces controlled by the United States to suppress, the United States collaborating with Belgium and Britain to directly send troops to invade, the Mobutu puppet regime to "encircle and suppress," hiring the most savage white mercenaries from abroad to massacre, and the U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism colluding to carry out political conspiracies of splitting, disintegrating, and buying off the patriotic armed forces, and so on. However, today, the old base area initially established in Kwilu remains unshaken, and the patriotic armed forces are still active in the vast rural and mountainous areas, constantly dealing heavy blows to the enemy, and becoming stronger and stronger in the war.

The Congolese guerrilla fighters, while engaged in intense battles, pay attention to learning Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war. Through continuous summarization of experiences, they have become more flexible and mobile in striking the enemy. They often carry out surprise attacks and ambushes, destroy railways, roads, and bridges, and eliminate the combat effectiveness of the puppet army. In the western Kwilu region, despite the puppet regime dispatching its elite troops to carry out the most brutal "encirclement and suppression," the areas controlled by the patriotic armed forces led by Mulele are gradually expanding. The activities of the guerrilla forces have far exceeded the initial base area—the Kikwit-Idiofa-Gongu triangle, reaching the banks of the Kasai River, operating near the port of Franqui, and even penetrating deep into the Kwango region. In the eastern region, the patriotic armed forces have controlled the areas along the shores of Lake Tanganyika, forcing the puppet army to withdraw from many areas. In the northeastern region, thousands of guerrilla fighters are waging guerrilla warfare in many areas. Under their blows, the puppet regime is unable to use many roads.

The patriotic armed forces of Congo (Leopoldville) have gradually clarified the idea of establishing and consolidating rural base areas and are striving to build and consolidate base areas. The patriotic armed forces have established administrative organs, military training camps, and schools in the Kwilu base area. To reduce the burden on the people of the base area, they have also reclaimed land, raised livestock, set up nets to catch fish, and built new-type villages in the forests. The patriotic armed forces recently issued a warning that made U.S. imperialism and its lackeys tremble: "Our Congo is a vast country with endless forests that can support us in waging guerrilla warfare for a hundred years."

Chairman Mao once said, "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can war be waged, and only by relying on the people can war be waged." The patriotic armed forces of Congo (Leopoldville) have received more and more support from the revolutionary people. Countless villagers provide the guerrillas with food and report on the activities of the puppet army. Even in small villages, political, social, and propaganda committees of revolutionary secret organizations have been established. Even in the enemy's "resettlement camps" (similar to the "strategic hamlets" established by the United States in South Vietnam), with the help of the people, the guerrillas have established political committees to organize the people to support the patriotic struggle.

To strike the enemy more effectively, the patriotic armed forces of Congo (Leopoldville) have recently seriously summarized experiences and lessons, rectified the troops, and unified their thinking. After summarizing, their direction of advance has become clearer, and their confidence has grown stronger. According to the report of the Congolese (Leopoldville) magazine "Revolution" at the end of last year, the leadership of the patriotic armed forces believed after summarizing experiences that the situation of armed struggle is very good. The broad masses of the people are being widely mobilized and are determined to wage an unyielding struggle for the liberation of the motherland. The Congolese people understand that the road of revolution has always been tortuous and rugged. However, the future is bright, and final victory is certain to come.

    充分发动群众　坚持武装斗争　建立农村根据地
    刚果（利）爱国武装力量在斗争中发展壮大
    新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：刚果（利）爱国力量一直坚持通过武装斗争实现真正的民族独立的正确方向，在战争中学习战争，不断总结经验，继续前进，夺取新的胜利。
    刚果（利）人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争烈火，是由缪勒尔领导的爱国武装力量于一九六四年初在西部克韦卢地区点燃起来的。随后这个正义战争的熊熊火焰便逐渐蔓延到东部和东北部。
    美帝国主义及其走狗对这些人民武装力量“围剿”了三年多，什么残暴毒辣的手段都使尽了，包括派遣由美国控制的“联合国军”去镇压，美国伙同比利时和英国直接出兵侵略，蒙博托傀儡政权进行“围剿”，从外国招去最凶残的白人雇佣军进行屠杀，美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义勾结在一起对爱国武装力量进行分化、瓦解、收买等政治阴谋活动等等。但是今天，最初在克韦卢建立的老根据地仍旧岿然不动，爱国武装力量仍然活跃在广大的农村山林中，不断给予敌人以沉重的打击，而且越战越强。
    刚果（利）游击战士们在紧张的战斗中注意学习毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想，通过不断总结经验，更加灵活机动地打击敌人。他们经常进行突袭、伏击，破坏铁路、公路、桥梁，消灭傀儡军的有生力量。在西线的克韦卢地区，尽管傀儡政权出动最精锐的军队对这个地区进行最残酷的“围剿”，由缪勒尔领导的爱国武装力量控制的地区正在逐渐扩大。游击队的活动范围已经远远超过最初建立的根据地——基克韦特—伊迪奥法—贡古三角地带，而到达开赛河畔，在弗朗基港附近活动，并且深入到宽果地区内地。在东线地区，爱国武装控制了坦噶尼喀湖沿岸地带，迫使傀儡军撤出不少地区。在东北线地区，数以千计的游击战士在许多地区坚持打游击战。在他们打击下，傀儡政权无法使用许多条公路。
    刚果（利）爱国武装力量还逐步明确了建立和巩固农村根据地的思想，正努力建设和巩固根据地。爱国武装力量在克韦卢地区的根据地已建立有行政机构、军事训练营和学校等。他们为了减轻根据地人民的负担，还开荒种地，饲养家畜，张网捕鱼，在森林中建起了新型农村。爱国武装力量最近发出使美帝国主义及其走狗为之丧胆的警告：“我们刚果是一个拥有可供我们打一百年游击战的无穷无尽的广阔森林的大国”。
    毛主席曾经说过，“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”刚果（利）爱国武装力量得到了越来越多的革命人民的大力支持。无数村民向游击队提供粮食，递送关于傀儡军活动的情报。在很小的乡村里，也建立了革命秘密组织的政治、社会和宣传委员会。即使在敌人的“收容站”（类似美国在南越建立的“战略村”），由于有人民的协助，游击队也建立了政治委员会，组织群众支持爱国斗争。
    为了更有力地打击敌人，刚果（利）爱国武装力量最近认真总结经验教训，整顿队伍，统一思想。经过总结，他们的前进的方向更明确了，信心更足了。据刚果（利）《革命》杂志去年底报道，爱国武装力量领导机构总结了经验后认为：武装斗争的形势好得很。广大人民群众正在广泛地动员起来，为祖国解放而决心进行不屈不挠的斗争。刚果人民懂得，革命的道路从来都是曲折的、崎岖的。但是前途是光明的，最后的胜利一定会到来。
