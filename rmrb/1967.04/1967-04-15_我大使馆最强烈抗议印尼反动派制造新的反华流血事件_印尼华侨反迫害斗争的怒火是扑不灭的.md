Our Embassy Strongly Protests Indonesian Reactionaries for Creating New Anti-Chinese Bloodshed
The Righteous Anger of Indonesian Overseas Chinese in Their Struggle Against Persecution Cannot Be Extinguished

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 14th, the right-wing military authorities in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, following the massacre of the Chinese overseas citizen Huang Jianmin, have now destroyed his memorial hall, seized his coffin, and rallied fascist thugs to loot Chinese-owned shops and residences, implementing a "scorched earth" policy, plunging the city of Surabaya into a bloody terror. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, lodging the strongest and most urgent protest against the Indonesian government over this incident.

	Under the direct planning and organization of Sumitro, the commander of the Eighth Military Region in East Java, the right-wing military authorities in Surabaya, on April 7th, immediately after Huang Jianmin's body was laid to rest, dispatched fully armed troops and organized a large mob to block and injure the mourning overseas Chinese, attack and destroy the martyr's memorial hall, seize the coffin, and arrest the martyr's brother. On April 8th, they rallied thousands of thugs to launch a frenzied attack on Chinese-owned shops and residences throughout the city and nearby areas, implementing a "scorched earth" policy of looting, destroying, and burning everything, resulting in thousands of overseas Chinese losing their hard-earned possessions over the years, their livelihoods destroyed. Many overseas Chinese were arrested, and some were severely beaten, their lives hanging by a thread.

	The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia expressed indignation over the above incidents and warned the Indonesian government: No matter how many tricks and vicious methods you employ, you will never be able to extinguish the righteous anger of the broad masses of overseas Chinese in their struggle against persecution and for survival. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of overseas Chinese are fearless and will not be bullied by anyone. Your bloody atrocities can only provoke broader and more intense resistance from them. One Huang Jianmin falls, but thousands of Huang Jianmins will rise. The martyr's blood will not be shed in vain, and the martyr's heroic image will forever live in the hearts of millions of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people will never tolerate your bloody atrocities and various evil deeds. You will surely be condemned by the Indonesian people and people of the world. No matter what, you will not escape the punishment of history.

    我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼反动派制造新的反华流血事件
    印尼华侨反迫害斗争的怒火是扑不灭的
    据新华社十四日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚东爪哇西都文罗市右派军人当局，最近继枪杀华侨黄健民烈士的惨案以后，又捣毁了烈士灵堂，劫走棺柩，并纠集法西斯暴徒抢劫华侨商店和住宅财物，实行了“三光政策”，使西都文罗市的华侨处于血腥恐怖之中。中国驻印尼大使馆十二日照会印尼外交部，对此向印尼政府提出了最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    西都文罗市右派军人当局，在东爪哇第八军区司令苏米特洛的直接策划和组织之下，四月七日当华侨黄健民的遗体刚入殓，就出动了全副武装的军队，组织了大批暴徒，阻拦和打伤吊唁的华侨，袭击和捣毁烈士灵堂，劫夺了棺柩，抓走了烈士的哥哥。四月八日又纠集成千名暴徒向全市和附近各地的华侨商店和住宅疯狂袭击，并实行了抢光、毁光和烧光的“三光政策”，致使数以千计的华侨，多少年来辛勤所得，被洗劫一空，生计断绝。大批华侨被捕，还有一些华侨惨遭毒打，生命垂危。
    中国驻印尼大使馆对上述事件，表示难以抑制的愤慨，并正告印尼政府：尽管你们施展各种阴谋诡计，用尽各种毒辣手段，妄图扑灭广大华侨反迫害、求生存的斗争怒火，是绝对办不到的。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨是无所畏惧的，是绝对不能任人摆布的。你们的血腥暴行，只能激起他们更广泛、更剧烈的反抗。一个黄健民倒下去，千百个黄健民站起来，烈士的鲜血是不会白流的，烈士的英雄形象，将永远活在千千万万华侨的心里。中国人民对你们残杀华侨的血腥暴行和种种罪恶勾当，是绝对不能容忍的。你们必将受到印尼人民和全世界人民的正义谴责。无论如何，你们也逃脱不了历史的惩罚。
