The Third Platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has shared their experience: focusing on fundamental political and ideological work and emphasizing revolution not only drives current production but also lays the foundation for the long-term development of factories and mines.

I. Should We First Work in the Mines or Focus on the Fundamentals?

After the Third Platoon arrived at the Yanbian Coal Mine, a debate arose. At that time, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the mine's party were spreading a counter-revolutionary economic wind, leading to low worker attendance and a lack of responsibility for certain tasks. As a result, the coal production plan for February was not completed, affecting the normal production of some enterprises. Therefore, many comrades advocated for leading by example and immediately working in the mines to encourage more workers to go underground and boost production.

Some comrades believed: we cannot stay in the coal mine long-term, and with limited time, we should focus on production rather than fundamentals. Otherwise, we might end up with nothing: neither production nor fundamentals achieved.

The party branch of the Third Platoon and some other comrades believed that while boosting production is indeed important, how we achieve this is crucial. They said: "Our support for factories and mines is not just about providing labor; it is mainly about supporting Mao Zedong Thought." If the military supports factories and mines without focusing on revolution and fundamental political and ideological work, and instead rushes to work in the mines and focus on production, this reflects a purely military viewpoint. Such an approach will not lead to good production outcomes.

After discussions, all members of the platoon reached a consensus: the more urgent the production tasks, the more we need to focus on revolution; the shorter the time, the more we need to focus on political and ideological work, which is the fundamental issue.

II. How to Focus on the Fundamentals?

The Third Platoon's approach to focusing on fundamental construction was to let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. Besides working and propagating at the mine entrance, they used various forms such as broadcasts, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, picture exhibitions, cultural performances, and sharing sessions to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They never took over or replaced the masses' efforts. For those deceived and misled by bad elements and thus not actively participating in production, they did not force their views on the masses. Instead, they organized them to study Chairman Mao's works and party policies with questions in mind, link theory with practice, analyze problems, and raise awareness. This approach was very effective. Some deceived middle and lower-level cadres also became aware and said: "The PLA used Mao Zedong Thought to open my eyes. In the future, no matter what deception I encounter, I will be able to see through it!" They all stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively participated in the revolution, and led production.

Another approach was to start with class education to help the masses break personal desires and establish public-mindedness. Through the extensive propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, most of the masses' enthusiasm was high, and normal production was restored in two days, completing the state's daily production plan. However, some cadres and workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative were unstable, causing production to fluctuate. This made the Third Platoon's comrades realize that only by helping the masses break personal desires and establish public-mindedness, and achieve a transformation in worldview, could their revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative be consolidated. They organized revolutionary workers to engage in activities recalling family history and mine history. Young worker Wei Daohe previously thought that after working for eight years, doing the work of a sixth-level worker but only receiving the pay of a fourth-and-a-half-level worker was too unfair. Now that the overproduction bonus has been canceled, whether one works hard or not makes no difference. Therefore, he was not enthusiastic about the revolution or production. After the hardship education, he realized that it was the party and Chairman Mao who saved him from misery and gave him today's happy life. He firmly declared in front of the masses that to defend Mao Zedong Thought, he must do a good job in the revolution and production, and become a pioneer in grasping revolution and promoting production.

Another approach was to strengthen the long-term construction of revolutionary organizations. After entering the mine, the Third Platoon began to pay attention to cultivating cadres within the revolutionary organizations and revolutionary workers and cadres. They selected capable cadres and active members of the platoon studying Chairman Mao's works to provide guidance on studying Mao Zedong Thought for the revolutionaries, sharing their personal experiences, and passing on political and ideological work experience. At the same time, they helped the revolutionaries establish a system for studying Chairman Mao's works, rectify study organizations, form family history and mine history groups, and carry out pilot activities for the "One Red" campaign, making regular political and ideological work lively and vibrant.

III. Focusing on the Fundamentals Leads to Production Increase

In more than half a month, due to the Third Platoon's focus on fundamental political and ideological work, the revolutionary workers in the three mines they were responsible for propagating showed significant changes in their spiritual outlook. The atmosphere of striving to be models in grasping revolution and promoting production was thick, and the revolutionary production order was getting better and better. Recently, they have overfulfilled the state plan and created the highest daily production record for the entire mine this year. Under the leadership of the production command department, production is steadily rising, and the new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production is surging higher and higher.

    部队支援厂矿首要抓什么？
    解放军某部三连的体会是：狠抓根本性的政治思想建设，狠抓革命，这不仅能推动当前的生产，而且为厂矿的长远建设打下基础。
    一、先下矿劳动，还是先抓根本？
    三连来到延边煤矿以后，就发生了一场争论。当时，正是矿上党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大刮反革命经济主义黑风的时候，工人的出勤率比较低，有些事情无人负责，二月份煤炭生产没有完成国家计划，影响了一些企业的正常生产。因此，不少同志都主张以身作则，立即下矿劳动，来带动更多的工人下坑生产，把生产突上去。
    还有些同志认为：咱们不能在煤矿长期干下去，时间短，不能抓根本，主要是抓生产。否则，就可能弄个鸡飞蛋打：根本没抓住，生产也上不来。
    三连的党支部和另外一些同志认为，把生产突上去，的确很重要。但是怎样突上去呢？首要的还是要抓根本性的政治思想建设。他们说：“我们支援厂矿，不是支援劳动力，主要是支援毛泽东思想。”部队支援厂矿，不抓革命，不抓根本性的政治思想建设，只是急着下矿劳动抓生产，这是单纯军事观点的一种反映。这样抓法，生产也不可能抓好。
    全连同志经过讨论，统一了认识：生产任务越急，越要抓革命；时间越短，越要抓政治思想工作这个根本。
    二、怎样抓根本？
    三连抓根本性建设，首要的一条是：让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。他们除下矿坑边劳动边宣传外，还采用广播、墙报、黑板报、图片展览、文艺演出、讲用会等多种形式，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，绝不包办代替。他们对于一些受坏人欺骗、蒙蔽而不积极参加生产的群众，也不是简单生硬地把自己的看法强加在群众身上，而是组织他们带着问题学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，联系实际，分析问题，提高觉悟。这样做，效果很好。有一些受了蒙蔽，撂了挑子的中下层干部，也都觉悟了，他们说：“解放军用毛泽东思想擦亮了我的眼睛，今后，不管什么迷魂药也能辨别出来了！”他们纷纷站到毛主席的革命路线一边，积极参加革命，领导生产。
    再一条是：从阶级教育入手，帮助群众破私立公。通过大力宣传毛泽东思想，大多数群众的积极性很高，两天就恢复了正常生产，完成了国家规定的日产计划。但是，还有一些干部和工人的革命热情和生产积极性不稳定，因而生产忽上忽下。这就使三连的同志认识到，只有帮助群众破私立公，实现世界观的转变，才能把革命热情和生产积极性巩固下来。于是，他们组织革命职工进行忆家史讲矿史的活动。青年工人魏道和，过去认为自己干了八年，做六级工的活，拿四级半工的工资太吃亏，现在又取消了超产奖励，干好干坏一个样，因而对革命和生产都不热心。经过忆苦教育后，他认识到是党和毛主席把自己从苦海里救出来，才有了今天的幸福生活，绝不能让那些党内走资本主义道路当权派再把工人拉回旧社会去过牛马生活。他在群众面前坚决表示，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，一定要搞好革命，搞好生产，做一个抓革命促生产的闯将。
    还有一条是：从组织上加强革命派组织的长远建设。三连进矿坑后，就开始注意在革命派组织和革命职工、革命干部中进行培养骨干的工作。他们选派得力干部、连队学习毛主席著作积极分子等，给革命派作毛主席著作学习辅导，用自己的亲身经历，给革命派骨干传授政治思想工作经验。同时，他们还帮助革命派建立学习毛主席著作制度，整顿学习组织，成立忆家史、矿史小组，开展“一对红”活动的试点等，使经常性的政治思想工作搞得生动活泼。
      三、抓了根本，生产上升
    半个多月来，由于三连注意了抓根本性的政治思想工作，他们所负责宣传的三个矿坑的革命职工，精神面貌都发生了变化，争当抓革命促生产的模范的风气很浓，革命的生产秩序越来越好，最近已超额完成国家计划，并创造了今年全矿最高的日产指标。在生产指挥部领导下，生产日益稳步上升，抓革命促生产的新高潮一浪高过一浪。
