    Exposing Oneself

    The leaders of the Soviet revisionists, such as Brezhnev, frequently declare that their foreign policy principles are to "oppose imperialism and reactionaries" and to "actively support the liberation movements of various peoples." However, their actions are the exact opposite of their words.

    Here is a recent example.

    On April 3, the Soviet revisionists' "trade delegation" and the reactionary government of "Malaysia" issued a joint communiqué stating that both sides have agreed in principle to exchange diplomatic missions and establish "normal diplomatic relations." This is another crime committed by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in openly colluding with imperialism and reactionaries, and brazenly opposing the liberation movements of various peoples.

    What is this so-called "Malaysia"? Everyone knows that it is a product of neo-colonialism created by American and British imperialism, a tool used by American and British imperialism to disrupt the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia. The Rahman puppet regime in "Malaysia" not only brutally suppresses the struggles of the Malay, Sabah, and Sarawak peoples for national independence but also actively serves as a lackey for American imperialism's aggression in Asia. It even helps the American aggressors train a large number of South Vietnamese puppet soldiers to massacre the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist clique openly colludes with such a thorough imperialist lackey and prepares to establish diplomatic relations, thus clearly exposing its counter-revolutionary face as an enemy of the Asian peoples.

    The Soviet revisionist clique once solemnly declared that "Malaysia" is "a reliable stronghold of colonialism in Southeast Asia," "one of the sources of tension in Southeast Asia," and "the rear base for American imperialism's adventures in South Vietnam and interference in Laos." Well, then, please explain: Now that you are openly colluding with "Malaysia" and preparing to establish diplomatic relations, isn't this clearly helping the colonialists prop up this "stronghold," strengthen this "source of tension," and consolidate this "rear base"? These traitors sometimes also speak in lofty terms, but these are insincere words. Therefore, they always expose themselves through their actions, thus further revealing their traitorous faces.

    The collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and "Malaysia" is a product of Soviet-American collusion. Currently, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are cooperating to actively form an anti-China encirclement. The big and small lackeys of U.S. imperialism in Asia are intensifying their conspiratorial activities for this purpose. It is at this very moment that the Soviet revisionist clique is eager to establish some "normal" relations with "Malaysia." The head of the Soviet "trade delegation" openly boasted in Kuala Lumpur that the Soviet revisionist clique has "common interests" with "Malaysia." What a "common interest"! One is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and the other is a small soldier of U.S. imperialism. The so-called "common interests" of the Soviet revisionist clique are nothing more than jointly serving U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and contributing to the new "holy alliance" led by U.S. imperialism, which is anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary.

    自己揭穿自己
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫之流三天两头地表白说，他们的对外政策的原则是“反对帝国主义和反动派”，“积极地支持各国人民解放运动”。但是，他们做的同他们说的恰好相反。
    下面就是最近的一个例子。
    四月三日，苏修的“贸易代表团”同“马来西亚”反动当局发表联合公报说，双方原则上同意互派外交使团，建立“正常外交关系”。这是苏修叛徒集团公开勾结帝国主义和反动派，猖狂反对各国人民解放运动的又一罪行。
    所谓“马来西亚”是个什么东西？谁都知道，它是美英帝国主义一手炮制出来的新殖民主义产物，是美英帝国主义破坏东南亚民族解放运动的工具。“马来西亚”的拉赫曼傀儡集团，不仅残酷地镇压马来亚、沙巴、沙捞越人民争取民族独立的斗争，而且积极充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的走卒，甚至帮助美国侵略者训练大批南越伪军屠杀越南人民。苏修集团竟然同这样彻头彻尾的帝国主义走狗公开勾结，准备建交，这就最清楚不过地暴露了自己与亚洲人民为敌的反革命面目。
    苏修集团过去曾经一本正经地说：“马来西亚”是“殖民主义者在东南亚的一个可靠堡垒”，是“东南亚紧张局势的策源地之一”，是美帝国主义“在南越的冒险行动和干涉老挝的活动的后方”。那末，请问：你们现在同“马来西亚”公开勾结，准备建交，这不明明是要帮助殖民主义者支撑这个“堡垒”，加强这个“策源地”，巩固这个“后方”吗？这些叛徒们，有的时候也讲些冠冕堂皇的话，但那是言不由衷的，因此，他们总是以自己的行动揭穿自己，从而更加暴露出自己的叛徒嘴脸。
    苏修集团同“马来西亚”的勾结，是苏美勾结的产物。目前，美帝苏修互相配合，积极拼凑反华包围圈。美帝国主义在亚洲的大大小小的走卒正在为此而加紧进行阴谋活动。正是在这个时候，苏修集团迫不及待地要同“马来西亚”建立什么“正常”关系。苏修“贸易代表团”团长在吉隆坡公然叫嚷苏修集团同“马来西亚”有“共同利益”。好一个“共同利益”！一个是美帝的头号帮凶，一个是美帝的一名小卒，苏修集团所谓的“共同利益”，不过是共同地为美帝的侵略政策效劳，为以美帝为盟主的反华、反共、反人民、反革命的新的“神圣同盟”出力而已。
