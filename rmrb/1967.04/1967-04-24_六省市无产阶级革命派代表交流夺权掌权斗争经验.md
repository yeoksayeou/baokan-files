Highly raise the revolutionary critical banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end

Revolutionary representatives from six provinces and municipalities exchanged experiences in seizing and holding power. They are determined to launch a great revolutionary mass movement to promote Mao Zedong Thought, to further broaden and deepen the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to closely connect this with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their respective regions, departments, and units, to advance revolutionary great unity, to achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and to win a thorough victory in this great decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Revolutionary committee representatives from Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong, who came to Beijing to congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, gathered with members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee in the presence of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. Over the past few days, they held meetings to learn from each other and exchange revolutionary struggle experiences, celebrating the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. At these meetings, the proletarian revolutionary comrades from the six provinces and municipalities unanimously expressed their determination to further broaden and deepen the nationwide criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They will closely connect this criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their respective regions, departments, and units. Through revolutionary criticism, they will further advance revolutionary great unity and achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, winning a thorough victory in the proletarian revolutionary struggle to seize power and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

At the full meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held on the 22nd, representatives from the revolutionary committees of five brother provinces and municipalities were invited to share their experiences in seizing and holding power. On the 23rd, representatives from the brother provinces and municipalities held experience-sharing and discussion meetings with the members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, divided into groups for revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students from institutions of higher learning, revolutionary teachers and students from secondary schools, revolutionary cadres, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army. At these meetings, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee introduced the work experience of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards' Congress of Institutions of Higher Learning, and the Red Guards' Congress of Secondary Schools to the representatives from the brother provinces and municipalities.

The proletarian revolutionary comrades from the six provinces and municipalities, reviewing the past stage of the struggle, all passionately pointed out that the victories in the struggle to seize power by the proletarian revolutionary factions in various places were all achieved under the warm care and full support of our great leader Chairman Mao. Each of their victories is the result of the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, a great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. At the meeting, the representatives repeatedly wished our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! They repeatedly shouted long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! They repeatedly read Chairman Mao's quotations and sang "The East Is Red," fully expressing the boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration of the proletarian revolutionary factions in various places for Chairman Mao.

The representatives from these six provinces and municipalities, which have already won victories in the struggle to seize power, all emphasized in their introduction of their struggle experiences that, as our great leader Chairman Mao has taught, the victories in the struggle to seize power by the proletarian revolutionary factions are "only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li." A large number of facts show that after seizing power, class struggle has not ended; the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is still fiercely ongoing. The proletarian revolutionary comrades in various places all expressed their determination to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily admit their defeat; they will make their last struggle." The representatives from various places also expressed their determination to firmly remember Chairman Mao's great call to the people of the whole country on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China to "carry the revolution through to the end," and especially to remember Chairman Mao's words at the time of victory: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." They all firmly expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to constantly enhance revolutionary vigilance, to smash at any time the counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, to firmly hold the reins of the proletariat, to forever maintain the humble, prudent, unarrogant, unhurried, and hardworking style, and to ensure that the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat will never change color.

The proletarian revolutionary comrades in various places also emphasized that to consolidate and develop the victories already achieved and to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, it is necessary to further broaden and deepen the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Currently, it is particularly important to focus on criticizing their bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" on the issue of cadres. The representatives from various places believe that by raising the revolutionary critical banner of Mao Zedong Thought, directing the struggle spearhead at the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of big and small power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and closely connecting the criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their respective regions, departments, and units, they can advance revolutionary great unity and achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combination in the revolutionary criticism. This is the current direction of the struggle. All revolutionary factions and revolutionary comrades must firmly grasp this direction of the struggle, unite the majority, concentrate on striking down a handful of revisionists, and win a thorough victory in this great decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

The representatives from various provinces and municipalities unanimously believe that the current criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is also a great revolutionary mass movement to promote Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionary factions in various places must learn Mao Zedong Thought better in the struggle. In the revolutionary criticism movement, they must study "Old Three Articles" thoroughly, criticize the big poisonous weed "Cultivation" by the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, and uproot their theoretical basis for restoring capitalism. They must bring the various new problems in the current struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines to study Chairman Mao's works better, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in various fields, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Over the past two days, the proletarian revolutionary comrades from various places have also exchanged experiences on how to hold power well and use power well after seizing power, how to establish a new revolutionary order, and how to better grasp revolution and promote production.

To better learn from each other and exchange experiences, during the stay of the revolutionary committee representatives from the five brother provinces and municipalities in Beijing, they will continue to have broader contact and more in-depth exchanges of revolutionary struggle experiences with the proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital.

    六省市无产阶级革命派代表交流夺权掌权斗争经验
    他们决心掀起大立毛泽东思想的伟大的革命群众运动，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动更广泛更深入地开展起来，同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改紧密结合，推进革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，夺取这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的彻底胜利。
    新华社二十三日讯　专程来北京祝贺北京市革命委员会成立的上海、山西、贵州、黑龙江、山东五个省、市的革命委员会代表团，和北京市革命委员会的成员们一起，欢聚在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边，连日来集会互相学习和交流革命斗争经验，共庆以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。在这些集会上，六省市的无产阶级革命派战友们，一致表示要把当前举国上下对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动更加广泛深入地开展起来，并且把大批判运动同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改紧密结合，在革命的大批判中进一步推进革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的彻底胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在二十二日举行的北京市革命委员会全体会议上，五个兄弟省、市的革命委员会代表团，应邀介绍了他们夺权和掌权斗争的经验。二十三日，各兄弟省市的代表团又和北京市革命委员会的委员们一起，分别举行了革命职工、贫下中农、大专院校革命师生、中等学校革命师生、革命干部和中国人民解放军代表的分组经验交流座谈会。在这些座谈会上，北京市革命委员会向兄弟省、市的代表团介绍了北京市革命职工代表会议、贫下中农代表会议、大专院校红卫兵代表大会和中等学校红卫兵代表大会的工作经验。
    六个省市的无产阶级革命派战友们，在回顾前一阶段的战斗历程时都满怀激情地指出，各地无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，都是在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和全力支持下取得的。他们的每一个胜利，都是伟大领袖毛主席英明领导的结果，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。会上，代表们一次又一次祝愿我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！一次又一次地欢呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！一次又一次地朗读毛主席语录，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，充分表达了各地无产阶级革命派对毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚和无限崇拜。
    这六个已经取得夺权斗争胜利的省市的代表们，在介绍他们的斗争经验时都强调指出，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所教导的，无产阶级革命派已经取得的夺权斗争胜利，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”。大量的事实表明：在夺权胜利以后，阶级斗争并没有结束；两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还在激烈地进行着。各地无产阶级革命派战友们都表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”各地代表们还表示，一定要牢记毛主席在中华人民共和国成立前夕向全国人民发出的“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，在胜利前进的时候尤其要记住毛主席的这段话：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”他们都坚定地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断提高革命的警惕性，随时粉碎资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，牢牢掌住无产阶级的印把子，永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和艰苦奋斗的作风，以保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
    各地无产阶级革命派战友们还强调指出，为了巩固和发展已经取得的胜利，把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定要把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动更加广泛深入地开展起来，当前尤其要着重批判他们在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。各地代表们认为，高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把斗争矛头集中指向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派，并且把大批判运动同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，这是当前斗争的大方向。一切革命派组织和革命的同志们都要牢牢地把握这个斗争的大方向，团结大多数，集中打击一小撮修正主义分子，夺取这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的彻底胜利。
    各省市代表们一致认为，当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，也是一场大立毛泽东思想的伟大的革命群众运动。各地无产阶级革命派一定要在斗争中把毛泽东思想更好地学到手。要在革命的大批判运动中大学“老三篇”，狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，铲除他们复辟资本主义的理论基础。要带着当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的各种新问题，更好地学习毛主席著作，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在各个领域里所散布的修正主义毒素，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个更新的阶段。
    两天来，各地无产阶级革命派的战友们，还互相交流了在夺权以后如何掌好权用好权，建立革命的新秩序，以及如何更好地抓革命、促生产等方面的经验。
    为了更好地互相学习和交流经验，在五个兄弟省市的革命委员会代表团逗留北京期间，他们还将同首都的无产阶级革命派继续进行更加广泛的接触，更深入地交流革命斗争的经验。
