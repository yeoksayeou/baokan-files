The publication of the editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine once again demonstrates the great concern of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao for all revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary masses. I listened to the broadcast over and over, my heart filled with excitement, and I couldn't help but raise my arms and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

I was transferred to Tsinghua University from the military in late 1959. Initially, I was very dissatisfied with the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Jiang X. However, due to being poisoned by "The Cultivation of the Self," I confused slave mentality with the organizational discipline of the proletariat, and I regarded that small handful of people who were taking the capitalist road as the embodiment of the Party. Gradually, I accepted their revisionist ideas. In my work, I carried out Jiang X's revisionist line.

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, under Chairman Mao's call, I, together with revolutionary comrades, posted big-character posters to expose Jiang X's crimes.

However, the work team, which was concocted by someone who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, as soon as it entered the school, faithfully carried out the bourgeois reactionary line of that person. On the one hand, it ruthlessly suppressed the revolutionary mass movement, labeling a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries"; on the other hand, in the matter of cadres, it implemented the policy of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group," pushing a large number of good and relatively good cadres "upstairs," and labeling a large number of good cadres as "black gangs." It also opposed us to the broad revolutionary masses. In the days of white terror, the work team forced me to admit that I was "consciously opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought," saying that my posting of big-character posters to Jiang X was a "false uprising." Later, some people from the former Red Guards of Tsinghua University locked me up in the "Biological Museum" and beat me severely, and also forced me to join the reform team. This is how the bourgeois reactionary line persecuted us, the broad revolutionary cadres, and shielded the small handful of people within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. Their intentions are so sinister, and their methods are so vicious!

At that time, although my understanding of the bourgeois reactionary line was not clear, I firmly believed that Chairman Mao would not agree with what they were doing. In those days of white terror, I kept chanting Chairman Mao's quotations and thinking of our red sun, Chairman Mao, in my heart.

Later, Chairman Mao issued the call: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." Revolutionary comrades said to me, "Comrade Dan, we understand you, and we hope you will come over." With the help of revolutionary comrades, I participated in some of their activities. It was then that I realized that "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" was a part of the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, I joined the combat team and, together with revolutionary comrades, exposed and criticized Jiang X's revisionist line.

Now, the editorial in *Red Flag* magazine has been published, which is a great encouragement to me. I will definitely cast aside all personal desires and, together with the revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, pursue the small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and resolutely pull down the number one person in the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

    誓死跟着毛主席革命到底
    清华大学前党委委员、职工部长  单计新
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章的发表，再次表明我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对广大革命干部和革命群众的极大关怀。我一遍又一遍地听着广播，心情十分激动，不禁振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    我是在一九五九年底由部队调到清华大学工作的。起初，我对反革命修正主义分子蒋××的统治，很看不惯。但是，由于我中了《修养》的毒，把奴隶主义同无产阶级的组织性纪律性混同起来，把那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派当作党的化身，我渐渐地接受了他们那套修正主义的东西。我在工作中，执行了蒋××的修正主义路线。
    在文化大革命初期，在毛主席的号召下，我同革命的同志一起，给蒋××贴了大字报，揭发他的罪行。
    然而，提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人一手炮制的工作组，一进学校就忠实地执行某某人的资产阶级反动路线，一方面疯狂地镇压革命群众运动，把大批革命群众打成“反革命”；另一方面在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，把广大干部推“上楼”，把大批好的和比较好的干部打成“黑帮”。还把我们同广大革命群众对立起来。在白色恐怖的日子里，工作组硬逼我承认是“自觉地反毛主席、反毛泽东思想”，说我给蒋××贴大字报是“假起义”。以后，前清华“红卫兵”的一些人又把我关到“生物馆”毒打，还逼迫我参加劳改队。资产阶级反动路线就是这样迫害我们广大革命干部，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们的用心是多么阴险，手段是多么恶毒啊！
    那时候，尽管我对资产阶级反动路线的认识还不清楚，但是，我深信他们这样做，毛主席他老人家是不会答应的。在那白色恐怖的日子里，我嘴里不断地念着毛主席语录，心里想着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    后来，毛主席发出号召：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”革命派的同志对我说：“老单，我们了解你，希望你站过来。”在革命派的帮助下，我参加了他们的一些活动。这时，我才认识到“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分。于是，我参加了战斗组，同革命派同志一起，揭发、批判蒋××的修正主义路线。
    现在，《红旗》杂志发表了评论员的文章，这对我是极大的鼓舞。我一定抛掉一切私心杂念，同革命派一起，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，穷追一小撮反革命修正主义分子，坚决把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拉下马来。
