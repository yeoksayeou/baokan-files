The invincible victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the new great proletarian cultural revolution in China has been warmly hailed by foreign friends.

Mao Zedong said: "People's social existence determines their thoughts. The correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will turn into a material force for transforming society and the world."

The world-famous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, is surging forward rapidly. Today's China is "red all over the land for ten thousand miles." Revolutionary people all over the world enthusiastically acclaim: "This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought," and "a great victory for the world revolutionary cause."

The Cultural Revolution spreads Mao Zedong Thought to hundreds of millions of people, greatly accelerating the historical process of world revolution

Revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically praise the fact that this "earth-shaking and heart-stirring" great revolution in China "embodies the great Mao Zedong Thought" and is "the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought." The Chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), Hill, in his article "We Salute the Earth-Shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China," said that this great revolution "has already spread the peak of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, to the hundreds of millions of people in China and to the hundreds of millions of people around the world, which means the vigorous development of the proletarian revolution." The Lao People's Democratic Republic's _Torch_ newspaper pointed out that this great revolution "demonstrates the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought and the unyielding revolutionary spirit of the 700 million Chinese people, and also shows that only the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought can carry out a thorough revolution."

Albanian Party of Labour Politburo member and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Shehu, stressed: "The great proletarian cultural revolution in China, under the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, is like the lava of a volcanic eruption, and it has historical and world significance because this great revolution guarantees the great socialist path of China, smashes and buries the dreams of the bourgeoisie and revisionists, sweeps away the garbage of the bourgeoisie, reactionaries, and revisionists, and revolutionizes the thoughts of the Chinese people who make up a quarter of the world's population, thereby inspiring all revolutionaries and oppressed peoples in the world." A friend from Laos pointed out that it is precisely because the Chinese people are "advancing under the victorious red banner of Mao Zedong Thought" that this great revolution is so "earth-shaking and overwhelming," making "imperialists panic-stricken and revolutionary people jubilant." Many revolutionaries from various countries pointed out that this great revolution, under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is "a great leap forward in the world revolutionary process"; "it will greatly accelerate the historical process of the world revolution," and it "points out the correct direction for carrying the socialist revolution to the end." Through this great revolution, "Mao Zedong has defended the future of the world revolution" and "defended the national independence movements and socialist revolutions of various countries." A poet from Panama sang the praises of this great revolution, saying it has created "great achievements for the liberation cause of progressive humanity," and it "like a sudden thunderclap, announces the arrival of a new dawn on earth."

In explaining the extremely great significance of this great revolution in China, various countries' revolutionaries pointed out that this is "a brilliant creation by Chairman Mao," a "clear sign of the correct Marxist-Leninist line," and "a unique contribution of Mao Zedong Thought to the arsenal of the world proletariat."

Chairman Mao has solved the problem of how to prevent capitalist restoration after the proletariat seizes power

Revolutionary people all over the world are deeply grateful to Chairman Mao for solving, in theory and practice, the new central issue of the international proletarian revolution: how to maintain power and prevent capitalist restoration after the proletariat seizes power; they praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao as "setting a new great example for the proletariat of the whole world." The editorial board of the Albanian newspaper _Voice of the People_ said: "This is one of the fundamental purposes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, that is, to maintain and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, so that it will not degenerate into the counter-revolutionary dictatorship of revisionism and the bourgeoisie. The extremely great significance of this revolution lies here." When the "January Revolution" storm swept across the whole of China, the revolutionary people of the world cheered even more enthusiastically: The struggle for power launched by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in China against a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, "greatly enriched and developed the experience of the Paris Commune and the October Socialist Revolution," it "fully embodies the brilliant thought of the great leader Chairman Mao of trusting and relying on the masses," and it "adds an invaluable treasure to the theory and practice of the proletarian revolution." A friend promoting Sino-Japanese friendship said: "This seizure of power from below, in the history of the international proletarian revolution and in the history of the international proletarian dictatorship, has opened a new era." He also said: "The experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China proves that even in a socialist country where the proletariat has already seized power, the power issue is still the fundamental issue of the revolution."

The revolutionary people of the whole world sincerely thank Chairman Mao for solving the problem of how to thoroughly reform all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. A group of Marxist-Leninists in Greece wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: The Marxist-Leninist theory that the superstructure, under certain conditions, exerts a great and decisive influence on its base, has been applied in the most creative way in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Every step of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is eliminating the roots of modern revisionism, making the last hope of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to restore the old system, which was overthrown by the great people's revolution in China, vanish into thin air.

The revolutionary people of the whole world sincerely thank Chairman Mao for creating the theory and experience that there are classes, class struggle, and a struggle between two lines under the dictatorship of the proletariat in a socialist society. The Chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), Hill, and the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, Griba, pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong summed up the experience of the international communist movement, pointing out that under the socialist system, classes and class struggle still exist, and the life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is still going on. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's new achievement and a brilliant development of Marxist-Leninist thought. A friend from North Kalimantan praised: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is one of the great concrete achievements of Mao Zedong's development of Marxism-Leninism to its peak, and is the latest development of the theory of class and class struggle."

The revolutionary people of the whole world sincerely thank Chairman Mao for launching this great revolution to transform people's souls and promote the revolutionization of people's thoughts, "setting up the most brilliant example for the ideological revolution of the revolutionary people of the world." Japanese friends who have visited China said: "The Chinese people use the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate selfishness," and "take Mao Zedong Thought as the unified ideology of the whole nation." The Executive Committee of the Leftist Revolutionary Movement of Uruguay issued a statement praising this great revolution as "a real and profound ideological revolution to transform the thoughts of hundreds of millions of men and women and turn Marxism-Leninism into the worldview of all the Chinese people."

The revolutionary people of the world, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, have come to recognize more deeply the outstanding genius of the great teacher of the contemporary world revolution, Chairman Mao, and love Chairman Mao even more. They say: The problems that the Soviet Union did not solve, Chairman Mao solved. This is great. Many revolutionary people in various countries say: Chairman Mao mobilizes the masses, relies on the masses, and lets the masses carry out the revolution themselves, "proving once again that Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary"; "only such a great leader can lead the great proletarian cultural revolution in China." A comrade from Vietnam said: I wish I had wings to fly immediately to the holy land of world revolution, Beijing, to see the great leader Chairman Mao with my own eyes. A young man from Tanzania wrote in a letter to the Chinese Red Guards, expressing his hope that they would greet Chairman Mao on his behalf: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The revolutionary people of the world, through this great revolution in China, have come to appreciate more deeply the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and have become more firmly convinced and reverent of Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries in various countries say that this great revolution "once again demonstrates the invincible power of the great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the old world and create the new world," and it has become "a banner of the boundless brilliant Mao Zedong Thought that all revolutionary people of the world respect and admire." A friend from Ceylon said: The revolutionary people of the world "are increasingly convinced that Mao Zedong Thought can lead the proletariat to victory." A friend from Hungary said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Our hope lies in the Chinese Communist Party armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

The revolutionary people of the world, through this great revolution in China, have come to understand more deeply the importance of mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and have become more enthusiastic about studying Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries in various countries pointed out that in this great revolution, the movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong's works that arose among the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in China "has opened a new era for the working people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism." Now this movement is spreading to the whole world. Many Marxist-Leninist parties and other revolutionary organizations in various countries have issued articles and resolutions, calling on their party members and cadres to actively study and propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) called on its party members and all working people to deeply study the lessons of this cultural revolution, and progressive newspapers in France, _New Humanity_, and other countries pointed out that the lessons of this great revolution are of immeasurable importance to the people of the whole world. A worker from Cuba said: All true socialist countries should carry out such a revolution.

Once Mao Zedong Thought, which is universally applicable, is grasped by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of the world, it will surely become an invincible material force. The revolutionary people of the world will surely smash imperialism, modern revisionism, and all the ghosts and monsters in the world into smithereens, and will surely create a new world of red radiance under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想新的伟大胜利
    外国朋友热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命
    毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”
    举世瞩目的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，正在迅猛地向前发展。今天的中国，“万里江山一片红”。全世界革命人民都热烈欢呼：这是“毛泽东思想的伟大胜利”，是“世界革命事业的伟大胜利”。
    文化大革命把毛泽东思想传播给亿万人民，大大加快世界革命的历史进程
    世界革命人民热烈称赞，中国这场“改天换地、震撼人心”的大革命“体现了伟大的毛泽东思想”，是“毛泽东思想放射出的光芒”。澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔在题为《我们向震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命致敬》的文章中说，这场大革命“已经把马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想传播给中国的亿万人民，传播给全世界的亿万人民，这意味着无产阶级革命的蓬勃发展”。老挝《火炬报》指出，这场大革命“显示了毛泽东思想的强大威力，显示了七亿中国人民的不断革命的精神，同时也表明了只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众才能进行彻底的革命”。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席谢胡同志强调指出：“在毛泽东同志伟大的马克思列宁主义思想指导下进行的，象火山爆发时的岩浆滚滚一样的中国无产阶级文化大革命，具有历史和世界意义，因为这场大革命保证了伟大的中国社会主义道路，粉碎和埋葬了资产阶级、修正主义的梦想，扫除了资产阶级、反动派、修正主义的垃圾，使占人类四分之一的中国人民的思想革命化，从而鼓舞了世界上所有的革命者和被压迫人民。”老挝一位朋友指出，正是由于中国人民“高举毛泽东思想胜利红旗前进”，这场大革命才如此“声震天地，气吞山河”，它使“帝国主义恐慌万状，革命人民欢欣鼓舞”。许多国家的革命者纷纷指出，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下的这场大革命，是“世界革命过程中的一个特大跃进”；“它必将大大加快世界革命的历史进程”，它“指明了把社会主义革命进行到底的正确的方向”。通过这场大革命，“毛泽东捍卫了世界革命的前途”，“捍卫了各国的民族独立运动和社会主义革命”。巴拿马一位诗人歌颂这场大革命创造了进步人类“解放事业的丰功伟绩”，它“犹如平地一声雷，宣告地球上新的黎明的降临”。
    各国革命者在阐明中国这场大革命的极其伟大的意义时指出，这是“毛主席的一个天才的创造”，是“正确的马克思列宁主义的路线的明显标志”，是“毛泽东思想对世界无产阶级武库所作出的独特贡献的最高表现”。
    毛主席解决了无产阶级夺取政权以后，如何防止资本主义复辟的问题
    全世界革命人民无比感谢毛主席，在理论上和实践中解决了无产阶级在夺取政权以后，如何保持政权，如何防止资本主义复辟这一国际无产阶级革命新的中心课题；称颂毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在这个问题上“给全世界无产阶级树立了新的伟大榜样”。阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章说：“这正是中国无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的之一，即维护和加强中国无产阶级专政，使它不致蜕变成为修正主义和资产阶级的反革命专政。这场革命的极其重大的意义就在这里。”当上海“一月革命”风暴席卷全中国的时候，世界革命人民更加热烈欢呼：中国无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开的夺权斗争，“大大丰富和发展了巴黎公社原则和十月社会主义革命的经验”，它“充分体现了伟大的领袖毛主席充分信任群众、依靠群众的光辉思想”，它“给无产阶级革命的理论和实践增加了无价之宝”。日本一位促进日中友好运动的朋友说：“这一自下而上的夺权，在国际无产阶级革命和在国际无产阶级专政的历史上，开创了新纪元。”他又说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的经验证明，即使在无产阶级已经取得政权的社会主义国家，政权问题仍旧是革命的根本问题。”
    全世界革命人民诚挚感谢毛主席，英明地解决了如何彻底改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑的问题。希腊的一批马克思列宁主义者在给毛主席的信中说：马克思列宁主义关于上层建筑对它的基础在一定条件下转过来起着伟大的决定性的影响的学说，在中国的无产阶级文化大革命中得到了最富有创造性的运用。中国的无产阶级文化大革命的每一个步骤都在铲除现代修正主义的根子，使帝国主义、修正主义和反动派妄图复辟被中国伟大的人民革命推翻了的旧制度的最后希望化为乌有。
    全世界革命人民衷心感谢毛主席，杰出地创建了社会主义社会存在着阶级、阶级斗争和在无产阶级专政条件下展开两条道路斗争的学说和经验。澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔和比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴都指出，毛泽东同志总结了国际共产主义运动的经验，指明在社会主义制度下，阶级和阶级斗争仍然存在，资产阶级和无产阶级谁战胜谁的你死我活的斗争还在进行。这是毛泽东同志的新的功绩和对马克思列宁主义思想的辉煌发展。北加里曼丹一位朋友称颂：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东把马克思列宁主义发展到顶峰的伟大的具体成果之一，是阶级、阶级斗争学说的最新发展。”
    全世界革命人民由衷感谢毛主席，发动这场改造人的灵魂、促进人的思想革命化的大革命，“为世界革命人民树立了进行意识形态革命的最光辉的典范”。访问过中国的日本朋友们说：“中国人民用毛泽东思想的强大武器来灭私”，“以毛泽东思想作为全国人民统一的思想”。乌拉圭左派革命运动执行委员会发表声明，赞扬这场大革命“是一次改造亿万男女的思想、把马克思列宁主义变为全中国人民的世界观的一次真正的深刻的意识形态的革命”。
    世界革命人民通过中国文化大革命更加认识到伟大导师毛主席的杰出天才
    世界革命人民通过中国这场大革命，更加认识到当代世界革命的伟大导师毛主席的杰出天才，更加热爱毛主席。他们说：苏联没有解决的问题，毛主席解决了。这太好了。许多国家的革命人民说：毛主席放手发动群众，依靠群众，让群众自己进行革命，“再次证明毛泽东是最伟大的革命家”；“只有这样伟大的领袖，才能领导中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。”越南的一位同志说：我多么盼望有一双翅膀，立即飞到世界革命圣地北京，亲眼看一看伟大领袖毛主席。坦桑尼亚一位青年在写给中国红卫兵的信中表示，希望他们见到毛主席的时候，代他高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    世界革命人民通过中国这场大革命，更加体会到毛泽东思想的无穷威力，更加坚定了对毛泽东思想的无限信仰和无限崇拜。许多国家的革命者说，这场大革命，“再一次显示出伟大光辉的毛泽东思想批判旧世界和创造新世界的无比强大的力量”，它成为一面“全世界革命人民都无比尊敬和钦佩的无限灿烂光辉的毛泽东思想的旗帜”。锡兰的一位朋友说：世界革命人民“对毛泽东思想能够引导无产阶级走向胜利，已经越来越深信不疑”。匈牙利的朋友说：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们的希望寄托在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党身上。”
    世界革命人民更加懂得掌握毛泽东思想的重要意义，更加热情地学习毛泽东思想
    世界革命人民通过中国这场大革命，更加懂得掌握毛泽东思想的重要意义，更加热情地学习毛泽东思想。许多国家的革命者指出，在这场大革命中，在中国的亿万革命群众中兴起的活学活用毛泽东著作的运动，“开辟了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元”。现在这一运动，正在向全世界扩展。许多国家的马克思列宁主义政党和其他革命组织纷纷发表文章和决议，号召他们的党员和干部积极学习和宣传毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的思想。意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会号召它的党员和全体劳动人民深入研究这次文化大革命的教益，法国《新人道报》和其他一些国家的进步报刊都指出，这场大革命的教益对于全世界人民的重要性是无法估量的。古巴一位工人说：真正的社会主义国家都应该进行这种革命。
    放之四海而皆准的毛泽东思想一旦为世界亿万革命人民所掌握，就必定变成无敌于天下的物质力量。世界革命人民一定会把帝国主义、现代修正主义和世界上一切牛鬼蛇神砸得稀巴烂，一定会创造出一个毛泽东思想照耀下的红彤彤的新世界。
