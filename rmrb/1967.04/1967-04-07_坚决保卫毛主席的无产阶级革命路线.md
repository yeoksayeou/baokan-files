The articles "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine and "Patriotism or Treachery?" by Comrade Peng Zhen have been published, sounding the new charge for a thorough criticism of the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he has concocted. We resolutely support and warmly applaud this! This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! It is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to defend his crimes, claims that he is an "old revolutionary" who has "encountered new problems" in the Cultural Revolution. After reading these two articles, I have further recognized that the top capitalist-roader in the Party is not an "old revolutionary" at all, but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary, and an old counter-revolutionary.

A true revolutionary, at the very least, should live for the revolution and die for the revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us to "make up our minds to sacrifice everything." The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, has always been a coward. Even before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously propagated the philosophy of survival, the philosophy of capitulation, and the philosophy of treachery, and directed others to surrender to the enemy, publicly issuing an "anti-communist manifesto" and swearing to "firmly oppose communism." After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao timely pointed out that we must "oppose Chiang Kai-shek to the hilt and fight for every inch of land." The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, stood on Chiang Kai-shek's side, proposing the line of "peaceful democratic new stage" to obstruct the complete victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. After the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao proposed to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, advocated "consolidating the new democratic order" and strongly opposed the socialist revolution. After the basic completion of the three major socialist transformations in our country, Chairman Mao timely pointed out: "Class struggle has not ended." The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, vigorously propagated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, actively advocated class cooperation, abolished class struggle, and prepared public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. For this very purpose, he as early as 1950, described the poisonous weed *The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty*, which beautifies imperialism, feudalism, and bourgeois reformism, as a patriotic film, and openly defied Chairman Mao's instructions by refusing to criticize this film. When imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries jointly opposed China, when our country encountered a major natural disaster and temporary economic difficulties, he again responded to the domestic and foreign ghosts and monsters, viciously attacking the Three Red Banners, advocating the revisionist line of "three freedoms and one contract," "three reconciliations and one reduction." What is particularly infuriating is that he attempted to obstruct the people of the whole country from further grasping Mao Zedong Thought. In 1962, he again threw out the poisonous weed *Cultivation*, which is becoming more and more "revisionist." In the great socialist education movement, he again proposed a line of opportunism that is "left" in form but right in essence. Countless historical facts prove that the top capitalist-roader in the Party is a careerist and conspirator who has always opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and is the chief backer of revisionism in our country.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the counter-revolutionary activities of this old counter-revolutionary have further developed. In the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is pointed out that the focus of this movement is to criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party who are in power. This old counter-revolutionary, however, directed the spearhead of struggle at the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. He dispatched a large number of work teams, directing the work teams to suppress the broad revolutionary masses on the one hand, branding revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and to suppress the broad cadres on the other hand, branding a large number of good and relatively good cadres as "black gangs," in an attempt to suppress the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and protect a handful of capitalist-roaders in power, so as to realize the dream of restoring capitalism. He has been so arrogant in opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is not at all "an old revolutionary encountering new problems," but an old counter-revolutionary committing new heinous crimes.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive moment of struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hold high the revolutionary critical banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and with great revolutionary spirit, fight to strip the top capitalist-roader in the Party of his "old revolutionary" disguise, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line he has concocted, make a full settlement of his counter-revolutionary crimes over the decades, especially thoroughly eliminate the poison of *Cultivation*, uproot this chief backer of revisionism in our country, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    学习毛主席著作积极分子　廖初江
    《红旗》杂志评论员的《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》、戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》两篇重要文章的发表，吹响了彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其所炮制的资产阶级反动路线的新的进军号。我们坚决拥护，热烈欢呼！这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了辩解自己的罪行，说他是“老革命”，是在文化大革命中“遇到了新问题”。看了这两篇文章，使我进一步认清了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命，反革命，老反革命。
    一个真正的革命者，最起码的要求，应该是为革命而生，为革命而死。毛主席教导我们，要为了革命事业“下定决心，不怕牺牲”。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却从来就是怕死鬼。早在抗日战争爆发前夕，他就大肆宣扬活命哲学、投降哲学、叛徒哲学，并指使别人投降敌人，公开发表“反共启事”，宣誓“坚决反共”。抗日战争胜利以后，毛主席及时指出，对蒋介石要“针锋相对，寸土必争”。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却站在蒋介石的立场上，提出“和平民主新阶段”的投降主义路线，妄图阻止中国人民民主革命的彻底胜利。全国解放以后，毛主席提出对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业要进行社会主义改造，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却主张“巩固新民主主义秩序”，极力反对社会主义革命。我国社会主义三大改造任务基本完成以后，毛主席及时指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却竭力宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，积极主张阶级合作，取消阶级斗争，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。正是为了这样的目的，他早在一九五○年，就把美化帝国主义、封建主义和资产阶级改良主义的大毒草《清宫秘史》，说成是爱国主义的影片，并且公然对抗毛主席的指示，不准对这部影片进行批判。当帝国主义、现代修正主义和印度反动派联合反华，我国遇到特大自然灾害，暂时经济困难的时候，他又同国内外的牛鬼蛇神遥相呼应，恶毒攻击三面红旗，鼓吹“三自一包”、“三和一少”的修正主义路线。特别令人气愤的是，他妄图阻挠全国人民进一步掌握毛泽东思想，一九六二年，又把那本越养越“修”的大毒草《修养》再一次抛了出来。在伟大的社会主义教育运动中，他又提出一条形“左”实右的机会主义路线……。无数的历史事实证明，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是个一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的野心家、阴谋家，是我国的修正主义总后台。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个老反革命的反革命活动又有了新的发展。毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命“十六条”中指出，这次运动的重点，是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这个老反革命却把斗争的矛头指向广大革命群众和广大革命干部。他派出大量工作组，指使工作组，一方面打击广大革命群众，把革命群众打成“反革命”，一方面打击广大干部，把大批好的和比较好的干部打成“黑帮”，妄图把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去，保护一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以便实现资本主义复辟的梦想。他这样猖狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，根本不是什么“老革命遇到了新问题”，而是老反革命又犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻。我们一定要坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，以大无畏的革命精神投入战斗，剥掉党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的“老革命”外衣，坚决粉碎他所炮制的资产阶级反动路线，全面清算他几十年来的反革命罪行，特别要彻底肃清《修养》的流毒，挖掉我国的这个修正主义总后台，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。　（原载《解放军报》）
