Albanian "New Light" Newspaper Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Sabotaging Asian and African Revolutionary Causes
Soviet Revisionists Help U.S. Imperialists Suppress National Liberation Movements

	NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Writers and Artists Association's organ, "New Light," published a commentary on April 2 stating that Albanian writers fully support all the resolutions adopted at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing last year. They resolutely condemn the recent attempt by the Soviet revisionist leadership to stage a fake "Third Asian and African Writers Conference" in Beirut.

	The commentary pointed out that the fake "Third Asian and African Writers Conference" recently staged by the Soviet revisionist leadership and their lackeys in Beirut is a complete farce. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to please the U.S. imperialists, is making every effort to split the struggles of the Asian and African peoples. In fact, this conference was funded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and has become a tool of U.S. imperialism.

	The commentary said that the Soviet revisionist leadership, which is striving to strengthen U.S.-Soviet cooperation, is helping U.S. imperialism and its lackeys maintain their reactionary rule. At the same time, they are doing everything they can to suppress the liberation movements of various peoples and disrupt the ranks of the Asian and African peoples who are uniting to fight against U.S. imperialism. This is the purpose of the fake "Third Asian and African Writers Conference."

	The commentary said that it is well known that imperialism and colonialism begin their aggression with cultural infiltration. Their literature and arts are important tools for preparing for aggression.

	The commentary said that the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing last year raised the banner of revolutionary struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. It has become a powerful pillar for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world in their anti-U.S. revolutionary struggle. Albanian writers fully support all the resolutions adopted by Asian and African writers in Beijing last year.

    阿尔巴尼亚《光明报》谴责苏修破坏亚非革命事业
    苏修帮助美帝扼杀民族解放运动
    新华社地拉那二日电  阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会机关报《光明报》二日发表评论说，阿尔巴尼亚作家完全支持去年在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议所作出的一切决议，坚决谴责苏联修正主义领导集团最近在贝鲁特策划召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。
    评论指出，苏联修正主义领导集团及其仆从最近在贝鲁特策划召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，是一出地地道道的丑剧。苏联修正主义领导集团为了讨好美帝国主义者，正在竭尽全力分裂亚非人民的斗争。事实上，这个会议是由联合国教育、科学及文化组织出钱筹备的，它变成了美帝国主义者的工具。
    评论说，一心一意为加强美苏合作而努力的苏联修正主义领导集团，正在帮助美帝国主义及其走卒继续保持其反动的统治，同时千方百计地扼杀各国人民的解放运动，破坏正在团结起来进行反美斗争的亚非各国人民的队伍。这就是伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的目的。
    评论说，众所周知，帝国主义、殖民主义从文化渗透开始进行侵略。它们的文学和艺术是为侵略作准备的重要工具。
    评论说，去年在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议高举反对帝国主义，反对新老殖民主义斗争的革命旗帜，成为亚非和全世界各国人民在反美革命斗争中的强大支柱。阿尔巴尼亚作家完全支持亚非作家去年在北京所通过的一切决议。
