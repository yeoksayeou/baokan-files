People's Liberation Army soldiers from a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region have been implementing the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. They have achieved one victory after another in supporting the revolutionary leftists, aiding industry, and aiding agriculture. Facing new situations and new tasks, they have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." The soldiers have decided to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, to work closely with the revolutionary masses in executing tasks, to humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, and to forever maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried style. They will forever be servants of the people and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The masses are the true heroes; we are forever servants of the people

The soldiers of the Fifth Company have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary leftists in the nearby areas, and have gone deep into factories, mines, and institutions to propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They have helped to seize the revolution and promote production, receiving warm welcomes and increasing numbers of letters of thanks and praise from the people. How should we treat these honors?

Company Commander Liu Shenghuang said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, there may arise in the Party, pride, the mood of a self-styled hero, the mood of complacency, the mood of wanting to enjoy oneself and not wanting to go through hardships any more." We follow Chairman Mao's instructions, analyze the thoughts within the unit, and some people, after hearing too many words of praise, become hot-headed, speak loudly, and learn less from the masses, becoming more self-righteous. These manifestations are exactly the pride and the mood of a self-styled hero that Chairman Mao criticized long ago. This is a serious test for us! If we do not be vigilant in time, we will be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie hidden in the praise, and we will not be able to complete the great strategic task of supporting the leftists to seize power given to us by Chairman Mao. We will not be able to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Therefore, we organized the unit to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the true heroes," and had discussions linking the actual struggle for power. This made everyone realize that the victory came from the revolutionary leftists following Chairman Mao's instructions, fearlessly fighting against the persecution and attacks by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We should attribute the credit to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the Party, and to the revolutionary masses. The masses praise us because our army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao. This is the masses' love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Revolutionary soldiers have only the duty to serve the people wholeheartedly and have no right to be proud of their achievements.

Soldier Liu Haichun said: I used to attribute the achievements to myself, which was completely wrong. We responded to Chairman Mao's great call to support the leftists. Without Chairman Mao, without Mao Zedong Thought, without the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and without the masses, we would not only not be able to accomplish anything, but we would also go astray. Pride is a corrosive agent, a manifestation of the "self" in one's mind when facing achievements. Having pride makes one unable to humbly be a student of the people and honestly be a servant of the people; one cannot stand firmly with the revolutionary leftists and support them wholeheartedly. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." To forever maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried style is determined by the nature of our people's army. Today, we are shouldering the great task of supporting the revolutionary leftists to seize power. We deeply realize that our task is heavy and the road is long. To remember Chairman Mao's teachings of being humble, cautious, guarding against arrogance and impatience is of even greater significance. In the future, I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and honestly serve the people for life, forever standing and fighting with the revolutionary rebels, and achieving victory together.

Defend against both open and covert attacks to always stand unshakable

When the Fifth Company went to a certain place to propagate, they often heard flattering words. With these problems in mind, they studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, which has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." They also had a heated discussion.

Model Soldier Cui Tongfu said: "We must be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets attacking us! We must not have the slightest complacency in the face of victory. Our struggle to support the revolutionary leftists to seize power is a great battle concerning the fate of China and the world. Our army plays an important role in realizing the revolution's 'three-in-one combination' and is a pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. The class enemies who are facing annihilation will surely regard us as 'thorns in their eyes.' Besides launching open and crazy counterattacks, they will also play new tricks. Those flattering words with ulterior motives are sugar bullets and covert arrows shot at us. If we lose our revolutionary vigilance, we will be hit by the sugar bullets.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a class without classes, an examination without exams. This 'class' and 'examination' include us facing the test of the bourgeoisie's sugar bullets. To temper ourselves into strong proletarian revolutionary soldiers, we must go through the stormy waves of class struggle and enhance our immunity in the struggle. Only by arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we defend against both open and covert attacks, always stand unshakable, and firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, completing the great strategic tasks given to us by Chairman Mao.

Soldier Li Deshan said: The brilliant and boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest weapon to repel the attacks of sugar-coated bullets. Because of the 'self' in one's mind, one always feels that our work is done well, and the welcome and praise from the masses are natural. With the veil of pride covering one's eyes, one naturally cannot see the attacks of the bourgeoisie. 'Flies do not bite unbroken eggs.' With the 'self' in one's mind as the target of sugar bullets, bourgeois thoughts will take advantage of it and try to squeeze in, making it easy to be hit by sugar bullets. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to regard oneself as both a force and an object of the revolution. We broke down the 'self' in our minds and established the 'public' in our minds. By looking at problems with Mao Zedong Thought, our hearts became clear, our eyes became bright, and our feet became firm.

To carry the revolution through to the end, we must carry out the revolution of breaking down the 'self' and establishing the 'public' in our minds to the end

Chairman Mao said: "To achieve national victory is only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li." How can we follow Chairman Mao's Long March step by step and always stand unshakable, always keep the red flag flying? The soldiers of the Fifth Company have engraved Chairman Mao's teachings in their hearts: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried style, and continue to maintain a style of hard struggle."

Model Soldier Wang Wenhai said: To complete the great revolutionary task, we must inevitably encounter numerous obstacles. Those class enemies who cling to the capitalist corpse will inevitably struggle and counterattack to the death, trying to obstruct the advance of the historical wheel. If we do not heighten our vigilance, if we complete this great historical mission with selfish and impure thoughts, we will inevitably be hit by the enemy's sugar bullets. Because the target of the 'sugar bullets' is the 'self.' Therefore, to complete the great historical task and carry the revolution through to the end, we must first carry out the revolution of breaking down the 'self' and establishing the 'public' in our minds to the end. Currently, the great commander Chairman Mao has given us the task of supporting the broad masses of the leftists, which is to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and remove the obstacles hindering social progress. To complete this great strategic task, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away the selfish and impure thoughts in our minds, smash the targets of sugar bullets, free ourselves from the constraints of the 'small self,' and always make the enemy powerless and without opportunities, always keeping the red color.

Political Instructor Zhao Jianmin said: Pure steel is tempered in the furnace. The iron bones and steel muscles of revolutionary soldiers resisting evil winds and currents are tempered in the struggle. The Eighth Company of Nanjing Road, relying on the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the golden "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," has seen through the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, resisted the poisonous winds of the bourgeoisie, and maintained the red color of the people's army. They have walked through the waves of class struggle, tempering a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao. In our struggle to support the revolutionary leftists, we have deeply felt that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can see through all the tricks of the class enemies, we can withstand any severe tests, and we can bravely throw ourselves into the great crucible of the revolution, using high temperatures and fierce fires to temper ourselves into steel. In the future, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, build our company into a company that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line on the front line of class struggle, making our soldiers forever the most conscious and loyal soldiers defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and defending the proletarian red political power.

    沈阳部队某部指战员牢记毛主席教导永远保持谦虚谨慎作风
    紧紧地和革命群众在一起  在文化大革命中创立新功
    新华社沈阳六日电  人民解放军沈阳部队某部五连指战员，贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的指示，在支持革命左派、支援工业、支援农业等取得一个又一个胜利，在新的形势和新的任务面前，他们反复学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。指战员们决心按照毛主席的教导，在执行任务中，紧紧地和革命群众在一起，虚心向革命群众学习，永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的优良作风，永远做人民的勤务员，在无产阶级文化大革命中再创新功。
    群众是真正的英雄，我们永远是人民的勤务员
    五连指战员响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决支持驻地附近革命左派夺权，深入到厂矿机关宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，帮助抓革命促生产，受到人民群众热烈欢迎，感谢信、赞扬声，越来越多。应该怎样对待这些荣誉？
    连长刘身煌说：毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，分析了部队的活思想，有的人听赞扬的话多了，脑子就热了，说话嗓门也粗了，遇事虚心向群众学习少了，自以为是多了。这些表现就是毛主席早就批评的骄傲情绪，功臣自居的情绪。这对我们是一场严重的考验啊！如不及时警惕，就会被夹在赞扬声中的资产阶级糖衣炮弹射中，就不能完成毛主席交给我们的支持左派夺权的伟大战略任务，就不能坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。于是，我们组织部队学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，联系夺权斗争实际进行了座谈讨论，使大家认识到，胜利的得来，是无产阶级革命派按照毛主席的指示，不怕迫害，不怕围攻，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派英勇斗争的结果。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，要归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于党和革命群众，归功于红色造反者。群众赞扬我们，是因为我军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，这是群众对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。革命战士只有全心全意为人民服务的义务，没有丝毫居功骄傲的权利。
    战士刘海春说：我过去把成绩记在自己账上，这完全记错了。我们是响应毛主席的伟大号召支持左派的。离开了毛主席，离开了毛泽东思想，离开了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，离开了人民群众，我们不但办不成什么事情，还会走到邪路上去。居功骄傲是一种腐蚀剂，是头脑里的“私”字在成绩面前的表现。有了骄傲情绪就不能虚心当人民的小学生，老老实实的做人民的勤务员；就不能永远和无产阶级革命派站在一起，满腔热情地支持他们。毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”永远保持谦虚谨慎不骄不躁的作风，是我们人民军队的本质决定的。今天，我们肩负着支持革命左派夺权的伟大任务，我们深深意识到我们任重而道远。牢记毛主席谦虚、谨慎、戒骄、戒躁的教导，具有更加重要的意义，今后，我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，老老实实为人民服务一辈子，永远和革命造反派战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    明枪能挡，暗箭能防，永远立于不败之地
    五连进驻某地下去宣传时不断听见一些捧场的话。带着这些问题，他们学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”并且进行了热烈的讨论。
    五好战士崔同富说：“要警惕糖衣炮弹向我们的进攻！决不能在胜利面前有丝毫的自满情绪。我们支持革命左派夺权的斗争，是一场关系着中国命运和世界命运的伟大战斗。我们军队在实现革命的“三结合”中负有重要责任，是无产阶级专政的柱石。已经面临灭顶之灾的阶级敌人必然要把我们看作“眼中钉”，除了进行公开的疯狂反扑，他们还会耍出新花招。那些别有用心的捧场，经济主义，就是向我们射来的糖弹、暗箭。如果我们丧失革命警惕，就会被糖弹打中。
    无产阶级文化大革命是不上课的上课，是不经考试的考试。这个“上课”，这个“考试”，就包括我们在资产阶级糖弹面前见世面、受考验。要把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士，就要在阶级斗争的狂风恶浪中去斗、去闯，在斗争中增强免疫力。我们革命战士只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，才能做到明枪能挡，暗箭能防，永远立于不败之地，永远坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大的战略任务。
    战士李德山说：光芒万丈、光焰无际的毛泽东思想是打退糖衣炮弹进攻的最强大的武器。
    因为头脑里“私”字作怪，总觉得我们工作做得不错，群众的欢迎和赞扬也是理所当然的，有了居功骄傲这块蒙布遮住眼睛，对资产阶级的进攻自然就看不见了。“苍蝇不叮没缝的鸡蛋”，头脑里有“私”字这块糖弹的靶子，资产阶级思想就会投其所好，拚命地挤进来，很容易被糖弹打中。后来我们学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和林副主席的既把自己做为革命的一份力量，又把自己当做革命的对象的指示，在头脑里大破私字，大立公字，用毛泽东思想去看问题，心就明，眼就亮，脚跟就稳当了。
    要将革命进行到底就得把头脑里“破私立公”的革命进行到底
    毛主席说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”怎样才能步步紧跟毛主席长征，永远立于不败之地，永远保持鲜红的旗帜呢？五连指战员的心坎上铭刻着毛主席的教导：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    五好战士王文海说：要完成伟大的革命任务，必然要遇到重重阻力，那些死抱住资本主义僵尸不放的阶级敌人，必然要做垂死的挣扎、反扑，企图阻挡历史车轮前进。假如我们不提高警惕，假如我们带着私心杂念去完成这个伟大的历史使命，必然要被敌人的糖弹打中。因为“糖弹”的靶子就是“私”字。所以，要完成伟大的历史任务，将革命进行到底，就得首先把自己头脑中的破私立公的革命进行到底。当前，伟大统帅毛主席交给我们的支持左派广大群众的任务，就是要我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，搬开阻挡社会前进的“绊脚石”。要完成这个伟大战略任务，就得用毛泽东思想横扫我们头脑里的私心杂念，砸烂糖弹的靶子，从“小我”的束缚中解放出来，永远叫敌人无计可施，无机可乘，永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    指导员赵建民说：纯钢是在烈火中炼成的。革命战士顶歪风，抗逆流的钢筋铁骨是在斗争中千锤百炼的。南京路上好八连在繁华热闹的南京路上，靠着光焰无际的毛泽东思想，靠着金灿灿的《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，识破了资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，顶住了资产阶级的香风毒气，保持了人民军队的鲜红颜色。他们顶着阶级斗争的风浪走，炼就了一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心。我们在支持革命左派的斗争实践中更加深刻地体会到，头脑里有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就能识破阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，就能经受住任何严峻的考验，就能勇敢投身到革命的大熔炉里去，用高温烈火把自己百炼成钢。今后，我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，在阶级斗争的第一线上，把我们的连队建设成永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的连队，使我们的战士，永远成为捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线、捍卫无产阶级红色政权的最自觉、最忠诚的战士。
