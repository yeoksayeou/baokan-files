In the process of implementing departmental unification, how should the proletarian revolutionary factions correctly handle the various contradictions within their units? Recently, comrades from some grassroots units in Qingdao that have done a good job in departmental unification shared their experiences with reporters from this newspaper on how they have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

Acknowledging Contradictions, Not Avoiding Them

A responsible comrade from the Qingdao Intestinal Membrane Factory Revolutionary Committee said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "All contradictions are objectively existing things." He also said, "The idea that there are no contradictions is a naive idea that does not conform to objective reality." When we proletarian revolutionaries implement unification, we must not adopt an attitude of denying the various contradictions that exist within our units. If we attempt to cover up or avoid contradictions in order to implement unification, even if we temporarily unify, it will eventually fall apart. Only by boldly exposing contradictions, scientifically analyzing them, and correctly handling them can the proletarian revolutionaries achieve true unification on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our factory proposed the issue of departmental unification in early March. At that time, there were two major organizations in the factory: the "East Red" Liaison Headquarters and the Red Headquarters Intestinal Membrane Factory Branch, which had sharp contradictions. One organization accused the other of being "great power chauvinism," and the other accused the former of having "impure composition." To achieve unification, we tried to suppress these contradictions between the two major organizations. Therefore, we issued an "order," stipulating that the two major organizations were not allowed to hold meetings or activities privately; members of both sides were not allowed to wear armbands, and it was stipulated that both sides must stop all debates. However, you can't hide fire with paper. No matter what measures were taken, the objectively existing contradictions would eventually be exposed. At that time, although all revolutionary organizations across the factory had announced their dissolution, in the workshops and teams, there were still groups of three or five people who could not unify. Moreover, contradictions could escalate at any time.

Just at this critical moment, we studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao said, "All contradictions are objectively existing, and our task is to reflect them and solve them as correctly as possible." We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the various contradictions that existed in the factory at that time, especially the contradictions between the two revolutionary organizations, and conducted specific research. We believed that the revolutionary direction of the two major organizations was consistent. However, after seizing power, they both looked at each other from the perspective of their own small groups, thus generating various contradictions between them. These contradictions, in essence, were due to a "selfish" attitude. Therefore, we convened a factory-wide revolutionary mass meeting, calling on everyone to lift the lid on the contradictions. Following this, a "smash selfishness and establish public-mindedness" rectification movement was launched throughout the factory. After more than half a month of rectification, the contradictions between the various organizations were initially resolved, and on March 22, the entire factory truly achieved unification by workshop and team.

Chairman Mao said, "If there are no contradictions and no struggle to resolve contradictions within the Party, the Party's life will stop." After the proletarian revolutionaries unite, old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise. Only by continuously exposing contradictions and actively resolving them can the unification be continuously consolidated and developed.

Distinguishing Between Two Types of Contradictions

A responsible comrade from the Qingdao Department Store Revolutionary Committee said: In a grassroots unit, no matter how complex the contradictions exposed during the Cultural Revolution are, they ultimately boil down to two types: contradictions between the enemy and us, and contradictions among the people. In the process of implementing departmental unification, it is necessary to have a basic analysis of the contradictions within the unit. If you cannot distinguish between the enemy and us, treat comrades as enemies, and use the attitude of dealing with enemies to deal with comrades, or use ridicule and attack to deal with the shortcomings of other revolutionary organizations, it will exacerbate the contradictions and make unification impossible. At the same time, if you treat the enemy as a comrade and let those class enemies infiltrate the revolution, it will become a "merger of two into one," which will bring great losses to the Cultural Revolution.

Our company's "East Red" Liaison Station, after seizing power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the company, felt that only they were the most revolutionary and believed that other organizations were not revolutionary, and that unifying with them was "compromise" and "muddling through." Other revolutionary organizations also seized on the errors and shortcomings of the "East Red" Liaison Station, denying their overall direction. In this way, both sides attacked each other, muddying the waters, making it difficult to distinguish the nature of the contradictions, and both sides took some inappropriate measures, making the contradictions increasingly sharp, and they did not unify for more than a month after seizing power.

In late March, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee arrived at the company and promptly discovered this problem, guiding us to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on distinguishing between two types of contradictions, asking us to draw a clear line between the two. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it "Yan'an" or "Xi'an"? We used Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion to calmly analyze several revolutionary organizations. We found the following common points: first, they all firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; second, the target of their struggle was the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the company. These are the overall direction of the proletarian revolutionaries. These are the basis for achieving unification. If you ignore the overall direction of other revolutionary organizations, do not look at the essence and mainstream of other organizations, but instead focus on the minor issues of the other side and make a big deal out of them, treating comrades as enemies, you will stand on the wrong side. After clarifying the nature of the contradictions, everyone had the desire to unite, treating each other with comradely attitudes, helping and understanding each other, resolving differences, and thus achieving new unity on a new basis.

Starting from the Desire for Unity, Conducting Active Ideological Struggles

A proletarian revolutionary comrade from Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 said: After the proletarian revolutionaries achieved victory in the struggle for power, various contradictions within the revolutionary factions and between various revolutionary organizations often arise from localism, factionalism, and anarchism, among other non-proletarian thoughts. These are contradictions between two types of thoughts and two worldviews. The focus of these contradictions lies in the words "public" and "selfish." For the contradictions that exist between various revolutionary organizations, we must start from the desire for unity and conduct active ideological struggles. Through the "smash selfishness and establish public-mindedness" rectification movement, we can achieve a solid unification of the proletarian revolutionary factions on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 had 17 revolutionary organizations that jointly seized all the power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the mill on January 20. However, the day after the victory in the struggle for power, one organization issued a statement announcing its withdrawal from the joint organization. A few days later, other organizations also started to have disagreements. Initially, we thought it was just an individual phenomenon, but later the contradictions became bigger, which attracted our attention. We analyzed the contradictions that emerged between the various organizations, and ultimately, it was due to the word "selfish." We felt that this thought was very harmful and was a major obstacle to achieving unification and holding power in the future. Chairman Mao teaches us, "For all issues of an ideological nature, for all issues of controversy among the people, they can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive and subjugating methods." Therefore, we quickly launched a "smash selfishness and establish public-mindedness" rectification study after seizing power. At the rectification study meeting, everyone voluntarily used Chairman Mao's teachings as a yardstick and engaged in serious self-criticism and criticism. Because everyone was clear that these contradictions were contradictions among the people, during the criticism, everyone could start from the desire for unity, adopting a strict attitude towards oneself and a lenient attitude towards others, not letting go of principle issues but not dwelling on minor issues, seeking common ground while reserving differences. This active ideological struggle promoted unity between revolutionary organizations. During that period, we rectified every night, and the next day, we actively participated in the struggle to criticize the capitalist reactionary line. The deeper the rectification, the stronger the fighting spirit of the revolutionary organizations. Many comrades received profound education through the rectification. They said: We "fought" to make a revolution, just to defend Chairman Mao and defend the achievements of the socialist revolution. Struggling for fame and personal gain is not what we proletarian revolutionaries do! From then on, various non-proletarian ideological tendencies within the revolutionary organizations decreased, and the various revolutionary organizations strictly demanded of themselves and helped each other. On February 13, the proletarian revolutionaries of the entire mill re-unified on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Unite the Majority, Strike Down the Minority

A responsible comrade from the Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory Revolutionary Committee said: In the past, we thought that anyone who had participated in a conservative organization was a "die-hard royalist," and there was no place for them in the unification. After studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," our analytical ability improved, and we realized that the majority of the masses in the conservative organization were deceived and were victims of the capitalist reactionary line. Once they recognize what the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is, they will correct their mistakes and quickly return to the revolutionary line. Those who truly insist on a reactionary stance and defend the capitalist reactionary line are only a few people. If we do not use a class analysis perspective to look at problems and regard all masses who have participated in conservative organizations as "opponents," then we will push the forces that can be won over and united to the enemy's side, and we will not be able to achieve the goal of uniting the majority and striking down the minority.

Before unification, our factory had a conservative organization. After the revolutionaries took power, they did not do ideological work on the masses of this organization but took the measure of sealing it up. However, this did not solve the problem. Some deceived masses did not recognize the errors of this conservative organization, and the more it was sealed, the stronger their opposition became. From this incident, we realized that in dealing with conservative organizations, we must launch a political offensive, unite and win over the deceived masses, and isolate and strike down those stubborn and unyielding bad elements. To help the deceived comrades quickly return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we went deep into the workshops, investigated the reasons for their deception, and then held a debate, helping them understand what the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is and what the direction of the revolutionary struggle is. Revolutionary comrades also held separate talks with the masses who participated in the conservative organization, engaging in face-to-face ideological struggles, making them realize that they had been deceived. Through a series of in-depth and detailed ideological work, many deceived people realized that their previous direction was wrong, and some immediately turned against the capitalist reactionary line and exposed its crimes.

The masses who had participated in the conservative organization, after recognizing their mistakes, still needed to go through a process to truly rise up in revolution, and they would have many psychological concerns. During their transformation, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, not discriminating against them or looking down on them, but enthusiastically helping them and encouraging them to move forward. For those who had a deep understanding of their mistakes, were brave enough to turn against the reactionaries, and had taken action, we promptly held "Welcome New Comrades Meetings" and absorbed them into the revolutionary organization. Batch after batch of deceived masses woke up, and a small clique of capitalist-roaders panicked. They spread rumors and slandered, attacking those who had awakened as "traitors." Revolutionary comrades wrote big-character posters to refute this fallacy and support those who had risen up in revolution. By late February, the conservative organizations in the entire factory were completely dismantled organizationally and politically. A large number of previously deceived masses returned to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. On March 10, the entire factory implemented unification by workshop and team, organizing the vast majority of revolutionary masses into a unified revolutionary organization, forming a mighty army of the Cultural Revolution, and launching a fierce attack on the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

    在实行按部门大联合中如何正确处理各种矛盾？
    ——青岛无产阶级革命派谈活学活用《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的体会
    无产阶级革命派在新形势下实行按部门大联合的过程中，如何正确处理本单位存在的各种矛盾？青岛市一些大联合搞得比较好的基层单位的无产阶级革命派同志，最近向本社记者畅谈了他们在大联合中活学活用毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的体会。
        承认矛盾，而不是回避矛盾
    青岛肠衣厂革命委员会的一位负责同志说：毛主席教导我们：“一切矛盾都是客观存在的”。又说“没有矛盾的想法是不符合客观实际的天真的想法。”我们无产阶级革命派在实行大联合的时候，对于本单位存在的各种矛盾，绝不能采取不承认的态度。如果企图用掩盖矛盾、回避矛盾的办法来实行大联合，即使暂时联合起来，最后还是会破裂的。只有大胆地揭示矛盾，科学地分析矛盾，正确地处理矛盾，无产阶级革命派才能在毛泽东思想的基础上实现真正的大联合。
    我们厂是在三月初提出按部门实行大联合的问题的。那时，厂里“东方红”联络总部和红色总部肠衣厂分部两大组织，存在着尖锐的矛盾，这个组织攻击那个组织是“大国沙文主义”，那个组织攻击这个组织“成分不纯”。为了实现大联合，我们想把这两大组织的矛盾压下去。于是，就下了一道“通令”，规定两大组织都不准私自组织会议或活动；双方队员，一律不准佩带袖章，并规定双方必须停止一切争论。可是，纸里包不住火。不管采用什么措施，客观存在的矛盾总归要暴露出来。那时，虽然全厂跨车间的革命组织都已经宣布解散，但是，在车间和班组，照样是三个一堆，五个一帮，联合不到一块。而且，矛盾随时都有进一步激化的危险。
    就在这个节骨眼上，我们学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席说：“一切矛盾都是客观存在的，我们的任务在于尽可能正确地反映它和解决它。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，把全厂当时存在的各种矛盾作了分析，尤其是对这两个革命组织之间的矛盾，进行了具体研究。我们认为，两个大组织的革命大方向是一致的。但是，他们在夺权以后，都从自己小团体的利益出发来看对方，因而彼此之间产生了这样或那样的矛盾。这些矛盾，归结到一点，就是一个“私”字。于是，我们召开了全厂革命群众大会，号召大家把矛盾的盖子揭开。接着，在全厂范围内开展了破“私”立“公”的整风运动。经过半个多月的整风，各个组织之间的矛盾初步得到了解决，到三月二十二日，全厂真正实现了按车间、按班组的大联合。
    毛主席说：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”无产阶级革命派联合起来以后，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生了。只有不断地揭示矛盾，积极地解决矛盾，才能使大联合不断巩固，不断发展。
      严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾
    青岛市百货公司革命委员会的负责同志说：一个基层单位，在无产阶级文化大革命中不管暴露的矛盾多么错综复杂，归根到底，不外是敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾两种。在按部门实行大联合的过程中，必须对本单位存在的矛盾有一个基本的分析。如果分不清敌我，把同志当敌人，用对待敌人的态度来对待同志，或者用嘲笑和攻击的态度来对待其他革命组织的某些缺点，那就会使矛盾激化，搞不成大联合。同时，如果把敌人当同志，让那些阶级敌人钻进革命内部，那就成了“合二而一”，就会给无产阶级文化大革命带来极大的损失。
    我们公司的“东方红”联络站，在夺了公司内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权之后，就觉得只有自己是最革命的，认为别的组织都不革命，同他们搞联合就是搞“折中”、“和稀泥”。其他革命组织也抓住“东方红”联络站的一些错误和缺点，否定他们的大方向。这样互相攻击，把水搅混了，矛盾的性质分不清，双方都采取了一些不适当的措施，使得矛盾日益尖锐，夺权后一个多月一直没有联合起来。
    三月下旬，青岛市革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传团来到公司以后，及时发现了这个问题，引导我们反复学习毛主席关于区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，要我们必须划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是“延安”还是“西安”？我们以毛泽东思想为准则，平心静气地对几个革命组织作了分析。我们发现有以下几点是共同的：首先，都坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边；第二，斗争的矛头都是对准公司党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这些，就是无产阶级革命派的大方向。这些，就是实现大联合的基础。如果无视其他革命组织的大方向，不去看别的组织的本质和主流，而是抓住对方一些枝节问题大做文章，把同志当作敌人，自己就站错了立场。弄清了矛盾的性质，大家都有了团结的愿望，彼此以同志式的态度，互相帮助，互相谅解，分歧消除了，从而在新的基础上达到了新的团结。
    从团结的愿望出发，开展积极的思想斗争
    青岛国棉九厂的一位无产阶级革命派同志说：无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争的胜利以后，革命派内部和各个革命组织之间各种矛盾的产生，很多是来源于本位主义、小团体主义和无政府主义等等非无产阶级思想。这是两种思想、两种世界观的矛盾。这些矛盾的焦点，在于一个“公”字和一个“私”字上。对于各革命组织之间存在的这些矛盾，必须从团结的愿望出发，开展积极的思想斗争，通过破“私”立“公”的整风运动，在毛泽东思想的基础上，实现巩固的无产阶级革命派大联合。
    我们国棉九厂十七个革命组织，在一月二十日联合夺了厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切大权。但是，夺权斗争胜利的第二天，就有一个组织发表声明，宣布退出联合机构。过了几天，其他一些组织之间也闹起别扭来。开始，我们认为只是个别现象，后来矛盾越来越大，才引起我们的重视。我们分析了一下，各个组织之间暴露出来的矛盾，归根到底，就是一个“私”字作怪。我们觉得这种思想是十分有害的，是实现大联合和今后掌好权的大敌。毛主席教导我们：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”于是，我们在夺权后很快就开展了破“私”立“公”的整风学习。在整风学习会上，大家自觉地用毛主席教导作尺子，展开了严肃的批评和自我批评。由于大家明确了这些矛盾都是人民内部矛盾，在批评时都能从团结的愿望出发，采取了严以律己、宽以待人，原则问题不放松、枝节问题不纠缠，求大同、存小异的正确态度。这种积极的思想斗争，促进了革命组织之间的团结。那一段时间，我们每天晚上整风，第二天，就积极投入批判资产阶级反动路线的战斗。整风越深入，革命组织焕发出来的战斗力就越强。许多同志通过整风受到深刻的教育。他们说：我们“杀”出来闹革命，就是为了保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义革命的成果。闹名、闹利，那不是我们无产阶级革命派干的！从此以后，革命组织中的各种非无产阶级思想倾向减少了，各革命组织严以律己，互相帮助，二月十三日，全厂无产阶级革命派重新在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了大联合。
        团结大多数，打击一小撮
    青岛内燃机厂革命委员会一位负责同志说：过去我们认为，凡是参加过保守组织的人，都是“铁杆保皇派”，大联合没有他们的份。学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以后，提高了分析能力，认识到保守组织中的大多数群众是受蒙蔽的，他们是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。一旦他们认清了什么是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就会纠正错误，迅速回到革命路线上来。真正坚持反动立场、维护资产阶级反动路线的坏分子，只是少数人。如果不用阶级分析的观点看问题，把凡是参加过保守组织的群众都看成“对立面”，那么就会把可以争取和团结的力量推到敌人那方面去，就不能达到团结大多数，打击一小撮的目的。
    我们厂在大联合以前，有一个保守组织。革命派掌权以后，没有对这个组织的群众进行思想工作，就采取了查封的措施。但是，这样做并不能解决问题。有些受蒙蔽的群众不认识这个保守组织所犯的错误，越封，对立的情绪越重。从这件事中，我们体会到，对待保守组织，必须展开政治攻势，团结争取受蒙蔽的群众，孤立和打击那些坚持错误、顽固不化的坏分子。为了帮助受蒙蔽的同志早日回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，我们深入车间，调查他们受蒙蔽的原因，接着举行了辩论会，帮助他们认识什么是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，什么是革命斗争的大方向。革命派的同志还分别找参加保守派组织的群众开座谈会，面对面地展开思想交锋，使他们认识到自己受了蒙蔽。通过一系列深入细致的思想工作，许多受蒙蔽的人认识到自己以前的大方向是错误的，有的当场反戈一击，起来控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行。
    参加过保守组织的群众，在认识错误之后，要真正起来造反，还要经历一个过程，还会有重重的思想顾虑。在他们转变的过程中，我们遵照毛主席的教导，不是歧视他们，看不起他们，而是热情地帮助他们，鼓励他们前进。对一些认识错误比较深刻、勇于倒戈造反并有行动表现的，我们及时举行“欢迎新战友大会”，吸收他们加入革命组织。一批批受蒙蔽的群众觉醒过来，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派慌了手脚。他们造谣中伤，攻击这些觉悟了的人是“叛徒”。革命派纷纷写大字报反击这种谬论，给起来造反的受蒙蔽的同志撑腰。到二月下旬，全厂的保守派组织从组织上和政治上，彻底被摧垮了。一大批过去受蒙蔽的群众回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。三月十日，全厂实行了按车间、按班组的大联合，把全厂绝大多数的革命群众组织到统一的革命组织中来，形成了一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了猛烈的攻击。
