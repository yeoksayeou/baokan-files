Our air force units have completely annihilated two U.S. F-4B type fighter jets that invaded our airspace over a certain area in Guangxi to provoke war. The New China News Agency reports from Nanning on the 26th:

Our air force units, who have made new contributions in defending our national airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were already on high alert. The radar operators, known as the "thousand-mile eyes," vigilantly captured the enemy's shadow on the radar screen, while the plotters accurately marked the enemy's flight path. The soldiers and officers deeply felt that the more tense the war preparedness, the more they needed Mao Zedong Thought. After receiving the battle order, they repeatedly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely decide to fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The soldiers and officers, with deep hatred for U.S. imperialism, made their vow: resolutely and thoroughly annihilate any enemy aircraft that dares to invade, making sure they come but do not return, and if one comes, fight one, if two come, fight two!

The battle began. The cunning enemy, seeing the situation was not in their favor, made sharp turns at high speed, attempting to escape our air force's punishment. At this critical moment, the soldiers and officers heard Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by them." Instantly, everyone felt braver, with doubled courage, they launched an attack on the enemy aircraft. The invading U.S. air pirates could no longer escape. A volley of cannon shells pierced the enemy aircraft, which then spewed thick black smoke and nosedived. At the same time, another volley of intense fire hit the other enemy aircraft, and a thick smoke filled the sky. The enemy aircraft, like a kite with its string cut, nosedived, completely revealing its paper tiger form.

The ethnic community members working in the fields, joyfully waved red flags and clapped their hands in delight. They mocked, saying, "These U.S. air pirates, who have been killing and causing havoc in Vietnam, have now come to invade our airspace and today received their deserved punishment."

Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force concluded this brilliant annihilation battle with glorious results. This is another victory song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The news of victory spread far and wide, and the revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters were overjoyed, spontaneously shouting long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    美机倒栽葱　纸虎现原形
    ——我空军部队全歼入侵我广西上空的两架美机的战况
    新华社南宁二十六日电　本社记者报道我空军部队一举全歼侵入我广西某地上空，进行战争挑衅的两架美国F—4B型战斗机的战况说：
    二十四日，广西地区雨后初晴，阳光灿烂，正是春耕生产大忙季节。当地人民公社的各民族社员响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，人人意气风发，干劲十足，犁田插秧，力争今年头季大丰收。突然，美帝国主义的强盗飞机，入侵我国领空进行军事挑衅。
    在保卫祖国领空，保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，做出了新的贡献的我人民解放军空军部队，早已严阵以待。被称为“千里眼”的雷达兵，机警地在荧光屏前捕捉敌机魔影，标图员准确地标下敌机的航迹。指战员们深深感到越是在战备紧张的时刻，越是需要毛泽东思想，当他们接到战斗命令之后，一遍又一遍地朗读着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”指战员们带着对美帝国主义的深仇大恨立下了自己的誓言：坚决彻底消灭敢于来犯的敌机，叫它有来无返，来一个打一个，来两个打一双！
    战斗打响了。狡猾的敌人见势不妙，用高速度转了一个大弯又一个大弯，企图逃脱我空军部队的惩罚。在这关键时刻，指战员们耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”顿时，个个感到浑身是胆，勇气百倍地向敌机发起了攻击。来犯的美国空中强盗，这时再也无法逃身了，一串串炮弹直向敌机钻去，只见敌机冒着浓浓的黑烟，一个跟头向下摔去。在同一时间内，猛烈的炮火又射中了另一架敌机，天空中又是一股浓烟，敌机象断了线的风筝，来了个倒栽葱，彻底显出了纸老虎的原形。
    正在田间插秧的各民族社员们，高兴地挥动红旗，拍手称快。他们嘲笑地说，这些美国空中强盗，成天在越南杀人作恶，现在又来侵犯我国领空，今天得到了应有的惩罚。
    我英雄的人民解放军空军部队以辉煌战果结束了这场漂亮的歼灭战，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌。
    胜利消息传遍四方，革命群众和革命小将们欢欣鼓舞，情不自禁地高呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线万岁！无产阶级文化大革命万岁！毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
