The National Committee of the Albanian Democratic Front held a meeting on the 17th to discuss the "Tasks of the Democratic Front in the Election of People's Assemblies and People's Courts." The meeting was chaired by Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the National Committee of the Democratic Front. Fadil Pacrami, Secretary of the National Committee of the Democratic Front, delivered a report at the meeting.

In his report, Pacrami emphasized that the upcoming elections for the People's Assemblies and People's Courts on June 4th are of particular importance in consolidating the people's power in the current stage of socialist construction.

Pacrami stated: The conditions for the June 4th elections are excellent. A great revolutionary fervor has mobilized the entire nation. The people are determined to carry the socialist revolution to its conclusion. In less than two months, the entire country has completed collectivization. Agricultural production cooperatives have also been established in the mountainous regions. This is another great victory for the Party, a victory of great significance. At the same time, various important initiatives have been proposed to further improve socialist production relations, such as reducing the private plots of cooperative members and launching a new production drive nationwide. The cultural revolution is proceeding smoothly, increasingly affecting all sectors and strata of our people. Great revolutionary initiatives such as the elimination of old remnants and backward customs, the complete liberation of women, the struggle against religious superstition, the enhancement of socialist consciousness, and the development of art and culture are becoming the broadest mass movement.

Pacrami said: In recent years, our socialist homeland has become even more prosperous and powerful. Under the decisive leadership of Comrade Hoxha and our brave Party, our people have smashed the plots, savage blockades, and all obstacles that the imperialists and the enemies of Khrushchev and Tito revisionism sought to impose on us. Our homeland has now become a strong bastion of socialism in Europe and the world. Our Party stands at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. Our Party and government stand firmly with the just struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, fully supporting the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression. The struggle of our Party and state against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism centered in the Soviet Union has won public praise. On the other hand, our country has forged an unbreakable friendship with the People's Republic of China, our people with the great Chinese people, and our Party with the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong.

In his report, Pacrami called on the Democratic Front at all levels to do a good job in the propaganda and organizational work for the elections of the People's Assemblies and People's Courts, mobilizing the masses to elect those who are loyal to the Party and the people's cause, and who are resolute revolutionaries to the end, to the People's Assemblies and People's Courts. He said, the Party calls on us to emphasize politics, and the Democratic Front at all levels is playing a truly important role in political and ideological education among the masses. From the countryside to the cities, old people, women, and youth, workers, cooperative members, and intellectuals are all writing letters, proposing initiatives, making guarantees, suggestions, and criticisms. All this also shows that the Democratic Front at all levels is playing an important role in the current revolutionary tide sweeping the country. Pacrami then emphasized that Comrade Hoxha, in his reply to the masses, highly praised these initiatives and also highly praised the work of the Democratic Front at all levels in this revolutionary movement.

Pacrami called on the Democratic Front at all levels to further carry out this revolutionary movement. He finally pointed out: At the same time, we must wage a resolute struggle against those who obstruct and sabotage this movement, especially the overthrown class enemies.

    霍查同志主持召开阿民主阵线全国委员会会议
    突出政治，深入开展革命化运动
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线全国委员会十七日举行会议，讨论“关于民主阵线在选举人民会议和人民法院运动中的任务”问题。
    会议由民主阵线全国委员会主席恩维尔·霍查同志主持。民主阵线全国委员会秘书长法迪尔·帕奇拉米在会上作了报告。帕奇拉米在报告中强调指出，今年六月四日即将举行的人民会议和人民法院的选举，对于在社会主义建设现阶段进一步巩固我国人民政权有着特别重要的意义。
    帕奇拉米说：六月四日选举的条件是很好的。巨大的革命热潮把全国人民都动员起来了。他们决心把我国社会主义革命进行到底。在不到两个月的时间里，全国完成了合作化。山区农村也建立了农业生产合作社。这是劳动党的又一个伟大胜利，一个具有重要意义的胜利。与此同时，各地提出了许多进一步改善社会主义生产关系的重要倡议，如减少农业生产合作社社员的自留地，在全国掀起推进生产的新运动等。思想文化革命正在顺利开展，它日益触及到我国各部门和各阶层人民。消灭旧残余和落后习俗，彻底解放妇女，反对宗教迷信，提高社会主义觉悟，发展艺术和文化等伟大的革命倡议正在成为最广泛的人民群众运动。
    帕奇拉米说：最近几年来，我们的社会主义祖国变得更加繁荣富强了。在以霍查同志为首的我们英勇的党的果断的领导下，我国人民粉碎了帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义敌人企图阻挡我们前进的阴谋、野蛮的封锁和一切障碍。我们的祖国现在已成了欧洲和全世界社会主义的强大堡垒。我们的劳动党站在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争的前列。我们党和政府站在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民正义斗争的一边，全力地支持英勇的越南人民反对美帝侵略的正义斗争。我们党和国家所进行的反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏联修正主义为中心的现代修正主义的斗争赢得了公众的赞扬。另一方面，我国同中华人民共和国、我国人民同伟大的中国人民、我们党同以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党结成了牢不可破的友谊。
    帕奇拉米在报告中号召民主阵线各级组织搞好人民会议和人民法院选举的宣传和组织工作，动员人民群众把忠实于党和人民事业的人、坚决革命和战斗到底的人选到人民会议和人民法院中去。他说，党号召我们突出政治，民主阵线各级组织在对群众进行政治思想教育工作中正在起着真正重要的作用。从农村到城市，老人、妇女和青年，工人、农业生产合作社社员和知识分子纷纷写信，提出倡议、保证、建议和批评。这一切也说明民主阵线各级组织在当前席卷全国的革命浪潮中起着重要的作用。帕奇拉米接着强调指出：霍查同志通过给群众的回信，高度评价了这些倡议，也高度评价了民主阵线各级组织在这一革命化运动中所进行的工作。
    帕奇拉米号召民主阵线各级组织进一步开展这一革命化运动。他最后指出：与此同时要同阻挡和破坏这一运动的人，特别是被推翻了的阶级敌人展开坚决的斗争。
