Tanzanian Ambassador to China Paul Eliyahu Mwaluko held a reception tonight to celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the United Republic of Tanzania.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Peng Shaohui, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Nie Yuanzi, and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital were invited to attend the reception.

Mwaluko and Chen Yi both spoke at the reception. They jointly wished for the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania to grow stronger in their common struggle against imperialism and neocolonialism led by the United States, to strengthen Afro-Asian solidarity, and to safeguard world peace.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned the Johnson administration of the United States for further escalating its military adventurism in Vietnam and accelerating the "escalation" of the war. He said that the Vietnamese people are not to be trifled with, and neither are the Chinese people. The U.S. aggressors will only hasten their own doom if they continue to escalate the war and expand their military adventurism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also condemned the recent series of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese measures taken by the Indonesian government, which are serious provocations aimed at disrupting the relations between the two countries. He pointed out that the Indonesian government's rampant anti-Chinese stance and stubbornness will not escape the punishment it deserves and will certainly meet a bad end.

Ambassador Mwaluko spoke about the achievements of the Tanzanian people in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in the development of their national economy. He said that they have taken a series of steps to achieve economic independence for the nation and have enacted policies to nationalize foreign enterprises.

When talking about the friendly relations between China and Tanzania, the ambassador said that the two countries have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which include mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China has provided Tanzania with moral and material support. The Government of the People's Republic of China has assisted Tanzania in building radio stations, opening sea routes, constructing textile mills, and training personnel. Chinese technical experts, educated and nurtured by the outstanding and great thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, have taken on their responsibilities seriously in Tanzania, overcoming numerous difficulties to strive for final victory.

The ambassador reiterated Tanzania's support for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations and expressed opposition to the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

When discussing the Vietnam issue, the ambassador said that the Vietnam War has drawn the legitimate concern of many countries and peoples from various continents. He hoped that the wanton destruction of humanity would stop and not escalate further, and he could not believe that the Vietnamese people would be invaders in their own country.

The ambassador expressed respect and congratulations for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He concluded by wishing long life to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the United Republic of Tanzania is a newly emerging country that has developed through continuous struggle against imperialism. He praised the Tanzanian people for raising the banner of national independence and marching forward with their heads held high. He said that not long ago, President Nyerere issued the famous "Arusha Declaration," clearly stating that the Tanzanian people want to build the country through self-reliance based on agriculture. This reflects the Tanzanian people's strong will to be masters of their own house and to eliminate colonialist forces. The Tanzanian people are determined to drive out imperialism and old and new colonialism and achieve complete and thorough independence and liberation, which is an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop.

Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the U.S. imperialists for ignoring the opposition of countries like Pakistan and using the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to shout about the so-called "Communist aggression" being the "main threat" to Southeast Asia, indicating that they will continue the war of aggression. He condemned the U.S. bandit planes for continuously and crazily bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong, and for blatantly violating Chinese airspace. He said that the Chinese people strongly denounce the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and firmly support the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese military and people in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation! They also warmly congratulate the recent victory of our heroic air force in annihilating the invading U.S. planes!

He said that U.S. imperialism, in order to cover up its war "escalation," in collusion with modern revisionism and the demons and monsters of the international arena, continues to play the "peace talks" trick. Recently, U.S. imperialism proposed the so-called "expansion of the demilitarized zone by ten miles on both the southern and northern sides," which is a complete hoax. The border between North and South Vietnam has long been broken by U.S. imperialism, and the demilitarized zone has been completely destroyed by U.S. imperialism. The people of North Vietnam have every right to support their brothers in the South. U.S. imperialism's attempt to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people by expanding the so-called demilitarized zone is absolutely impossible.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that recently, the Indonesian government has taken a series of rampant anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese measures, brutally killing and attacking our compatriots, surrounding and blockading our embassy, illegally abducting our diplomatic personnel, and unreasonably expelling our chargé d'affaires and consul general. This is a new atrocity of the Suharto-Nasution clique in carrying out fascist dictatorship and a serious provocation aimed at disrupting the relations between the two countries. The Chinese government and people express great indignation at this. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If someone does not offend me, I will not offend them; if someone offends me, I will offend them." We must make it clear to the Indonesian government that your rampant anti-Chinese stance will not escape the punishment you deserve, and your insistence on going your own way will certainly not end well.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, is advancing with the wind and waves, achieving victory. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a socialist China that will never change color will be even more effective in fighting against U.S.-led imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and will be even more powerful in supporting the revolutionary peoples of the world and fulfilling our glorious internationalist duties.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    坦桑尼亚驻华大使举行国庆招待会
    周恩来总理等应邀出席　宾主共祝两国友好关系日益发展
    新华社二十六日讯　坦桑尼亚驻中国大使保罗·埃利埃尔·姆瓦卢科今晚举行招待会，庆祝坦桑尼亚联合共和国建国三周年。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理兼外交部长陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，中国人民解放军副总参谋长彭绍辉，北京市革命委员会副主任委员聂元梓，首都无产阶级革命派代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    姆瓦卢科大使和陈毅副总理在招待会上讲了话，他们共祝中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民的友谊，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，加强亚非团结和保卫世界和平的共同斗争中日益发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中强烈谴责美国约翰逊政府在越南进一步扩大军事冒险，加速战争“升级”，并且伙同现代修正主义和国际上的牛鬼蛇神，继续玩弄“和谈”阴谋。他说，越南人民是不好惹的，中国人民是不好惹的。美国侵略者继续战争“升级”，扩大军事冒险，除了加速自己的灭亡以外，决不可能有别的结果。
    陈毅副总理谴责印度尼西亚政府最近采取一系列反华排华措施，蓄意破坏两国关系的严重挑衅行为。他指出，印度尼西亚政府猖狂反华，一意孤行，逃脱不了应有的惩罚，是绝对不会有好下场的。
    姆瓦卢科大使在讲话中介绍了坦桑尼亚人民在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、发展民族经济方面所取得的成就。他说，我们采取了一系列步骤来争取民族的经济独立，并颁布了把外国企业收归国有的政策。
    大使谈到中国和坦桑尼亚两国的友好关系时说，我们两国都以互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利以及和平共处五项原则作为指导两国关系的原则。中国从我们两国建立关系之日起，就给了我们道义和物质的支持。中华人民共和国政府在建立无线电台，开辟航海路线，修建纺织厂以及培训人员等方面，给了坦桑尼亚以援助。受到中国的杰出而伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的卓越思想教导和培育的中国技术专家，在坦桑尼亚认真地担负起自己的任务，克服了重重困难去争取最后胜利。
    大使重申，坦桑尼亚支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并且表示反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    姆瓦卢科大使谈到越南问题时说，越南战争受到许多国家和各大洲人民的正当的关注，我们希望肆无忌惮的毁灭人类的行为不再升级而停止下来，我们无法相信越南人民在他们本国内会是侵略者。
    大使对中国的无产阶级文化大革命表示敬意和祝贺。他最后祝中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东主席万寿无疆！
    陈毅副总理在讲话中指出，坦桑尼亚联合共和国是在同帝国主义不断斗争中发展起来的新兴国家。他赞扬坦桑尼亚人民高举民族独立的旗帜，正在昂首向前迈进。他说，不久以前，尼雷尔总统发表了著名的《阿鲁沙宣言》，明确宣布坦桑尼亚人民要走以农业为基础、自力更生建设国家的道路。这反映了坦桑尼亚人民要自己当家作主、肃清殖民主义势力的坚强意志。坦桑尼亚人民决心要赶走帝国主义和新老殖民主义，实现完全、彻底的独立和解放，这是任何力量也阻挡不了的历史潮流。
    陈毅副总理谴责美帝国主义不顾巴基斯坦等国的反对，利用东南亚条约组织部长理事会会议，叫嚷什么“共产党侵略”是东南亚的“主要威胁”，表示要把侵略战争继续进行下去。他谴责美国强盗飞机连续疯狂地、大规模地轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和海防市，谴责美国飞机明目张胆地侵犯我国领空。他说，中国人民愤怒声讨美帝国主义的滔天罪行，坚决支持越南人民的英勇斗争。中国人民热烈祝贺越南军民抗美救国战争的辉煌胜利！热烈祝贺最近我英雄空军全歼入侵美机的胜利！
    他说，美帝国主义为了掩盖它的战争“升级”，伙同现代修正主义和国际上的牛鬼蛇神，继续玩弄“和谈”阴谋。最近，美帝国主义提出所谓“非军事区南部和北部各扩大十英里”的“建议”，这完完全全是一个骗局。越南南北方的界限早已被美帝国主义打破，非军事区也早已被美帝国主义破坏无遗。越南北方人民完全有权支援自己的南方兄弟。美帝国主义妄图以扩大所谓非军事区来束缚越南人民的手脚，是绝对办不到的。
    陈毅副总理说，最近，印度尼西亚政府又采取了一系列猖狂的反华排华措施，残酷杀害和袭击我国侨民，包围、封锁我国大使馆，非法劫持我国外交人员，无理驱逐我国代办和总领事。这是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安集团实行法西斯专政的新的暴行，是蓄意破坏两国关系的严重挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨。毛主席教导我们说：“人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。”我们要明白地告诉印度尼西亚政府，你们猖狂反华，是逃脱不了应有的惩罚的，你们硬要一意孤行，是绝对不会有好下场的。
    陈毅副总理说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，正在乘风破浪，胜利前进。经过无产阶级文化大革命，一个永不变色的社会主义中国，将更有效地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，更有力地支援全世界革命人民，更好地完成我们光荣的国际主义义务。
    各国驻中国的使节也应邀出席了招待会。
