The U.S. imperialists have sent the "Peace Corps" to India to engage in espionage and cultural infiltration. This "Peace Corps" is being fiercely protected by the Indian reactionary government, which wants to keep it as a treasure in India.

According to a report from New Delhi by Xinhua News Agency on April 1, some members of the Indian Parliament condemned the Indian government for allowing one of its high-ranking officials (the Minister of Planning, Petroleum, Chemicals, and Social Welfare, the staunch pro-American and anti-Chinese Asoka Mehta) to attend a conference in Delhi sponsored by the U.S. "Peace Corps." One member pointed out that U.S. newspapers admit that the "Peace Corps" is a tool of the CIA, and some Asian and African countries have already demanded that the U.S. withdraw its "Peace Corps" from their countries.

The veteran pro-American politician and Deputy Prime Minister Desai, however, vigorously defended the U.S. "Peace Corps" in India during this meeting, claiming that the "Peace Corps" has done "beneficial work" in India. He strongly advocated for allowing these "Peace Corps" members to continue staying in India. This fully exposed Desai's servile face to the Americans.

The espionage activities of the U.S. "Peace Corps" have been opposed by the Indian people and some media outlets. One Indian newspaper pointed out that the "Peace Corps" is an organization used by the U.S. for espionage activities. The "Peace Corps" brings only harm to India and no benefit; its presence in India is a potential danger.

    一副奴才相
    印度政府竟把美国“和平队”当宝贝
    据新华社一日讯　新德里消息：美帝国主义派到印度搞特务活动和文化侵略的“和平队”，受到印度反动政府的极力庇护，要把它当作宝贝一样留在印度。
    在三月三十日的印度议会会议上，一些议员谴责印度政府允许它的一名高级成员（计划、石油、化学和社会福利部长、顽固的亲美反华分子阿索卡·梅达）出席了一个由美国“和平队”出钱在德里召开的会议。有一名议员指出，美国报纸都承认，“和平队”是中央情报局的工具，一些亚非国家已要求美国撤回派到他们那里去的“和平队”。
    老牌亲美政客、副总理德赛却在这次会议上极力为美国在印度的“和平队”辩解，说什么“和平队”在印度做了“有益的工作”。他极力主张让这些“和平队”员继续呆在印度。这就充分暴露了德赛的美国奴才的嘴脸。
    美国“和平队”的特务活动遭到印度人民和一些报刊舆论反对。一家印度报纸指出，“和平队”是美国用来进行间谍活动的组织，“和平队”对印度有百弊而无一利，它呆在印度是一种潜在的危险。
