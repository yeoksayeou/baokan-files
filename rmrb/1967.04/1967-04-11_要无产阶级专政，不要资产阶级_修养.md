Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage!

The broad ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, and with pen and sword, have launched a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party!

In this mass criticism movement, we must especially criticize the representative work of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, *Self-Cultivation*. Criticizing this book is an important part of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line he represents.

*Self-Cultivation* is pure deception. It is detached from the class struggle of reality, detached from revolution, detached from political struggle. It does not mention the fundamental issue of revolution, which is the issue of state power, nor does it mention the issue of proletarian dictatorship. It advocates idealist cultivation theory, obliquely promoting bourgeois individualism and slave mentality, opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In short, it wants bourgeois "cultivation" and not proletarian dictatorship.

Whether or not to have violent revolution, whether or not to seize power, whether or not to establish and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, has always been the focal point of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and all opportunism and revisionism.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. This is the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism.

Our great teacher and leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against a 'state.' The task of the revolution is to destroy the old state machine, build a new one that replaces it, and use this new one to suppress the enemies of the revolution and consequently to suppress all the oppressed people."

However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, who is cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, openly sings the opposite tune to this fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

In *Self-Cultivation*, he does not mention at all the path of violent revolution, smashing the old state machine, and establishing proletarian dictatorship to realize communism; instead, he talks about how "through the hands of the Communist Parties and peoples of various countries, their own countries are changed, and step by step the world is changed into a communist world." This is actually advocating peaceful transition. He asks Communist Party members to "painstakingly" engage in "cultivation" to realize this peaceful transition.

In *Self-Cultivation*, he does not want Communist Party members to regard seizing power and consolidating power as the highest interest of the proletariat and the laboring people, and to fight bravely for the proletariat to seize power and consolidate power, but rather to "improve themselves" into a "mature, seasoned politician" with the "highest self-respect and self-love." He wants them to engage in "cultivation" according to this standard.

In *Self-Cultivation*, he completely goes against Chairman Mao's teachings and does not want Communist Party members, in the class struggle of seizing power and consolidating power, to weather the storm and gain experience, to change their subjective and objective worlds; instead, he wants them to completely detach from the class struggle of reality, stay in the house, and use the methods of "study, reflection, and self-examination," and the method of "examining oneself three times a day" to engage in "cultivation."

In *Self-Cultivation*, he uses every means to stifle the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, advocates slave mentality, so that Communist Party members do not defend proletarian dictatorship, do not firmly fight against those like him who attempt to usurp the Party, the army, and the government, like the Khrushchev-type conspirators, but rather engage in "cultivation" according to the slave-like standard of "yielding and compromising," "repaying evil with good," and "absolute, unconditional" "obedience to superiors."

In a word, he does not want proletarian power, but wants bourgeois "cultivation." This is the "cultivation" method of the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

In fact, this "cultivation" method is not some new thing, but is a piece of junk picked from the garbage heap of history.

From the feudal rulers of China to the enemy of the people Chiang Kai-shek, they all, without exception, held up the reactionary teachings of the feudal theorists Confucius and Mencius on "self-cultivation and character-building" as opium to numb the people, to maintain their ruling position and system of exploitation.

From Bernstein and Kautsky to Tito and Khrushchev, all old and new revisionists also use "humanism," "self-improvement of man," and other forms of "cultivation" to carry out policies of fooling the people, making the proletariat and laboring people of capitalist countries and colonies forget the fundamental issue of seizing power, to maintain and consolidate the cannibalistic system of capitalism; making the proletariat and laboring people who have already seized power forget the fundamental issue of consolidating power, so that Khrushchev-type conspirators can carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, usurping the Party, the army, and the government, and putting the heavy shackles of exploitation and oppression back on the heads of the proletariat and laboring people.

All ruling classes of exploiters, all old and new revisionists, the "cultivation" methods they advocate are all lies. When the exploited rise up to overthrow their rule, they will tear off all their disguises and use even more brutal means to carry out savage suppression, making thousands and tens of thousands of people's heads roll.

Can the exploited and oppressed proletariat and laboring people give up the armed struggle to seize power, and according to the tenets of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, engage in "cultivation" in all seriousness? Can the proletariat of capitalist countries leave the struggle against the bourgeoisie, leave the central task of seizing power, stay in the house to "cultivate"? Can the proletariat and laboring people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America leave the battlefield of national liberation to "cultivate"? In countries where modern revisionism has usurped power and carried out capitalist restoration, can Communist Party members who insist on the revolutionary line of the proletariat leave the life-and-death struggle against modern revisionism, leave the struggle to seize power in revolution to "cultivate"? No! Absolutely not! If they do so, they will only be exploited and oppressed forever, never be liberated, and never see the light!

Can the proletariat and laboring people who have already seized power engage in "cultivation" according to the tenets of the top capitalist-roader in the Party? No! A thousand times no! A million times no! If they leave the struggle of the two classes and two lines, leave the struggle to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration, stay in the house and painstakingly "cultivate," Khrushchev-type figures will come to power, capitalism will be restored, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.

In summary, the methods of "self-cultivation and character-building" advocated by the reactionary ruling class and their representatives are completely hypocritical and deceptive. They think of oppression, love exploitation, and grab power. They have never intended to act according to their own "self-cultivation and character-building" methods. The proletariat and laboring people think of revolution and rebellion, and do the work of seizing power from the exploiting class and consolidating proletarian dictatorship. For the laboring people, the "cultivation" advocated by the reactionary ruling class and their representatives is, at any time and under any conditions, crocodile tears and opium for numbing. If the proletariat and laboring people believe in *Self-Cultivation* and forget about power, they will lose their center, forget their direction, forget politics, and forget the fundamental viewpoints of Marxism. They will suffer great losses, be fooled, and become politically mediocre and confused people, whose heads are cut off and they do not know how they died.

Chairman Mao earnestly teaches us: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The big affairs of the state, the people, and the Party, the biggest affair among big affairs, is power. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from the very beginning, has been a great struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, together with another top capitalist-roader in the Party, used the power they usurped to throw out the bourgeois reactionary line, carry out white terror, and madly attack the broad revolutionary masses and cadres, attempting to suppress the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The theoretical basis of this reactionary line is that infamous book, *Self-Cultivation*. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party use the teachings of *Self-Cultivation* to try to make people believe that they themselves are the representatives and incarnations of the Party, and that the broad Party members and masses can only be their "tamed tools." If one wants to seize their power, it is seizing the Party's power, "committing unforgivable errors in politics and Party discipline," and is "anti-Party" and "counter-revolutionary." They label revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and still want them to "tolerate" and "yield and compromise," "endure all kinds of humiliation without any resentment," be manipulated by them, be persecuted by them, and be subjected to bourgeois dictatorship. They use the opium of *Self-Cultivation* to deceive and poison many masses and cadres, attempting to make people forget the struggle of the two lines, not see the sharp and complex struggle to seize power, stifle people's revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and commit new heinous crimes.

However, the broad ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The thousand and one principles of Marxism can all be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" "Revolution is an uprising, an act of violence by one class to overthrow another." It is these great teachings that inspire the proletarian revolutionary masses to take aim at the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the top capitalist-roader in the Party and open fire fiercely. Many masses and cadres who have been poisoned by *Self-Cultivation* and supported the bourgeois reactionary line have also risen up in revolution, smashed the spiritual shackles of *Self-Cultivation* put on them, and joined the great struggle to defend proletarian dictatorship and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

At present, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party have not given up their failure. This handful of people are still launching a mad counterattack against the proletariat. They slander the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary young people as being "excessive," "rude," "overstepping the bounds," and having not undergone the "tempering and cultivation" of the two-line struggle within the Party, in order to defame the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary young people, and thus negate their correct direction. At the same time, they support conservative organizations, carry out counter-seizure of power, and fake "three-in-one combinations," stirring up the tide of capitalist restoration. All revolutionary masses and cadres must not listen to their nonsense. Revolution is not a crime, and rebellion is justified! The proletarian power won with blood and life must not be easily lost! The power seized by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party in some places with counter-revolutionary counter-seizure of power methods must be seized back!

Let the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his *Self-Cultivation* roll into the garbage heap of history! The proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao will definitely achieve complete and thorough victory! The power of our great socialist motherland will definitely be firmly grasped in the hands of the proletariat forever. The socialist mountains and rivers of our great motherland will definitely last for thousands of generations and never change color!

Always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always remember to emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

We want proletarian dictatorship, not bourgeois "cultivation"!

    要无产阶级专政，不要资产阶级“修养”
    史红军
    我国无产阶级文化大革命跨进了一个新阶段！
    广大无产阶级革命派，高举起革命的批判旗帜，口诛笔伐，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发动了总进攻！
    在这场群众性的批判运动中，特别要批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的代表作《修养》。对这本书的批判，是批判以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线的一个重要内容。
    《修养》这本书，纯属欺人之谈，它脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，宣扬唯心主义的修养论，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。总而言之，它只要资产阶级“修养”，不要无产阶级专政。
    要不要暴力革命，要不要夺取政权，要不要建立和巩固无产阶级专政，从来就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同一切机会主义、修正主义斗争的焦点。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题，这是马克思列宁主义的根本原理。
    我们最伟大的导师和领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    但是，披着马克思列宁主义外衣的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却公然与马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的这个根本原理大唱反调。
    他在《修养》中，绝口不讲通过暴力革命，打碎旧的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政的途径，去实现共产主义；却大谈什么：“经过各国共产党和各国人民自己的手，去改造自己的国家，从而一步一步地把世界改造成为共产主义的世界。”这实际是在宣扬和平过渡。他要求共产党员为实现这种和平过渡去“刻苦地”进行“修养”。
    他在《修养》中，根本不要共产党员把夺取政权、巩固政权当作无产阶级和劳动人民的最高利益，为无产阶级夺取政权、巩固政权去英勇战斗，而是要他们为“提高自己”成为一个具有“最高尚的自尊心、自爱心”的“成熟的、老练的政治家”去进行“修养”。
    他在《修养》中，完全违背毛主席的教导，不是要共产党员在夺取政权、巩固政权的阶级斗争中，去经风雨，见世面，改造主观世界和客观世界；而是要他们完全脱离现实的阶级斗争，关在房子里，用“学习、反省和自我检讨”的方法，用“吾日三省吾身”的方法去进行“修养”。
    他在《修养》中，千方百计扼杀革命的造反精神，宣扬奴隶主义，好让共产党员不去保卫无产阶级专政，不去同象他那样妄图篡党篡军篡政的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家作坚决的斗争，而是按照“委曲求全”、“以德报怨”、“绝对的、无条件的”“服从上级”，这种奴才式的标准去进行“修养”。
    一句话，不要无产阶级政权，只要资产阶级“修养”，这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的“修养”经。
    其实，这套“修养”经，并不是什么新鲜玩艺，而是从历史的垃圾堆中捡来的破烂。
    从中国历代封建统治者一直到人民公敌蒋介石，都毫无例外地捧着封建理论家孔丘、孟轲的那一套“修身养性”的反动说教，当作麻醉人民的鸦片，来维护他们的统治地位和剥削制度。
    从伯恩斯坦、考茨基一直到铁托、赫鲁晓夫，一切新老修正主义者，也是用“人道主义”、“人的自我完善”等种种“修养”经，实行愚民政策，使资本主义国家和殖民地的无产阶级和劳动人民，忘记夺取政权这个根本问题，以维持和巩固资本主义的吃人制度；使已经掌握政权的无产阶级和劳动人民忘记巩固政权这个根本问题，以便那些赫鲁晓夫式的野心家们实行篡党、篡军、篡政的反革命复辟，把剥削和压迫的沉重枷锁重新套在无产阶级和劳动人民的头上。
    一切剥削阶级统治者，一切新老修正主义者，他们所宣扬的那一套“修养”经，都是骗人的鬼话。当被剥削者起来推翻他们的统治的时候，他们就会撕去一切伪装，使出更加残酷的手段，进行疯狂的镇压，使千百万人民人头落地。
    被剥削被压迫的无产阶级和劳动人民，能够放弃武装夺取政权的斗争，按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的信条，去“郑重其事”地进行“修养”吗？资本主义国家的无产阶级，能够离开反对资产阶级的搏斗，离开夺取政权的中心任务，关在房子里去“修养”吗？亚非拉地区的无产阶级和劳动人民，能够离开民族解放的浴血战场，去进行“修养”吗？在被现代修正主义篡夺了政权，实行资本主义复辟的国家中，坚持无产阶级革命路线的共产党人，能够离开同现代修正主义的殊死斗争，离开革命的夺权斗争去进行
  “修养”吗？不能！绝对不能！如果那样，就只有永远受剥削、受压迫，永远得不到解放，永远见不到光明！
    已经掌握了政权的无产阶级和劳动人民是否可以按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的信条，去进行
  “修养”呢？不能！一千个不能！一万个不能！如果离开两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，离开巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的斗争，关在房子里苦心孤诣地“修养”，赫鲁晓夫式的人物就要上台，资本主义就会复辟，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。
    总而言之，反动统治阶级及其代表人物，他们所说的那一套“修身养性”的办法，完全是虚伪的，骗人的。他们想的是压迫，爱的是剥削，抓的是政权，他们从来也不准备按照他们自己所说的“修身养性”的那一套去作。无产阶级和劳动人民想的是革命造反，干的是从剥削阶级手里夺取政权和巩固无产阶级专政。对于劳动人民说来，反动统治阶级及其代表人物所说的修养，无论在任何时候，任何条件下，都是鳄鱼的眼泪，麻醉的鸦片。无产阶级和劳动人民，如果相信《修养》，忘记政权，就是失掉了中心，忘记了方向，忘记了政治，忘记了马克思主义的根本观点。就会吃大亏，上老当，成为脑袋掉了还不知道是怎么死的政治上的庸人，糊涂人。
    毛主席语重心长地教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”国家、人民、党的大事，大事中间的大事，就是政权。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从一开始，就是一场向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的伟大斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派伙同另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，利用他们窃取的权力，抛出资产阶级反动路线，实行白色恐怖，疯狂地打击广大革命群众和广大革命干部，妄图把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打下去。这条反动路线的理论基础，就是那本臭名昭著的《修养》。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派用《修养》的说教，企图使人们相信，他们自己就是党的代表、党的化身，广大党员和群众只能是他们的“驯服工具”。如若要夺他们的权，就是夺党的权，“在政治上、党的纪律上犯了不可饶恕的错误”，就是“反党”、“反革命”。他们把革命群众打成“反革命”，还要人家“容忍”“委曲求全”，“忍受各种屈辱而毫无怨恨之心”，听他们摆布，任他们迫害，任他们搞资产阶级专政。他们用《修养》的鸦片，蒙蔽和毒害了不少群众和干部，妄图使人们忘记两条路线的斗争，看不见尖锐复杂的夺权斗争，扼杀人们的革命造反精神，犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    但是，广大无产阶级革命派却牢牢记住了毛主席的伟大教导：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”正是这些伟大教导，激励着无产阶级革命派，瞄准以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子猛烈开火。许多受过《修养》毒害，维护过资产阶级反动路线的群众和干部，也奋起革命，砸碎《修养》套在他们身上的精神枷锁，投入捍卫无产阶级专政和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大斗争。
    当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派并没有甘心自己的失败。这一小撮人还在向无产阶级发动猖狂的反扑。他们诬蔑无产阶级革命派和革命小将“过分”、“粗暴”、“越轨”，“太不温良恭俭让”，没有“党内两条战线斗争的锻炼和修养”，借以丑化无产阶级革命派和革命小将，从而否定他们的大方向。同时，扶植保守派组织，搞反夺权，搞假“三结合”，掀起资本主义复辟的逆流。一切革命群众和革命干部，绝不能听他们那一套。革命就是无罪，造反就是有理！用血汗和生命换来的无产阶级政权，绝不能轻易丧失！某些地方被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派用反革命的反夺权手段夺去的权力，一定要重新夺回来！
    让党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其《修养》滚到历史的垃圾堆里去吧！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一定会取得完全、彻底的胜利！我们伟大社会主义祖国的政权，一定能永远牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里。伟大祖国的社会主义江山一定会千秋万代，永不变色！
    念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗！
    要无产阶级专政，不要资产阶级“修养”！
