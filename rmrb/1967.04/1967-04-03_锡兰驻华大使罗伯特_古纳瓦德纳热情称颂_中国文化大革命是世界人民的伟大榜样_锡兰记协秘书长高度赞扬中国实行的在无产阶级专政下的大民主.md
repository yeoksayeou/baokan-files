Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Robert Gunewardena enthusiastically praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a great example for the world's people. The secretary-general of the Sri Lankan Journalists' Association highly praised China's implementation of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

New China News Agency, Colombo: On March 28, Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Robert Gunewardena said here, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great example for the whole world."

Robert Gunewardena said at a public meeting on "Discussing the Chinese Cultural Revolution" held by the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, 700 million Chinese people have collectively developed their own country and are moving forward."

He said, "Due to the Cultural Revolution, China has advanced further."

He pointed out, "The Cultural Revolution has promoted production and accelerated work efficiency."

He praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution as being very orderly. The Red Guards played a great role in this revolution.

He emphasized that some people say China is trying to export revolution, which is slander. China will not export revolution to other countries.

This meeting was chaired by the chairman of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, Alahakone.

About 700 people from various strata of Colombo attended the meeting. Gunewardena's speech was warmly received by the audience.

On March 22, in an interview with the Sinhala-language organ of the Sri Lankan Communist Party, the "Labor News," Gunewardena also praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Gunewardena said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a very far-sighted and important step taken to build socialism.

Gunewardena believes that it is ridiculous to slander and defame the great Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong without understanding anything about what is happening in this country.

Gunewardena asked: Is it not an ungrateful act to slander the People's Republic of China, which always helps us like a good friend whenever we encounter difficulties?

Gunewardena believes that although Muslims make up only a small part of China's population, Chinese Muslims live a happier life than Muslims in other countries.

New China News Agency, Colombo: Recently, the secretary-general of the Sri Lankan Journalists' Association, D. Jayakody, made a speech praising the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He said, "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat carried out by the People's Republic of China is a great encouragement to all revolutionary people in the world."

He said, "When I was in China, I saw very clearly that the revolutionary people of China not only want to consolidate their socialist revolutionary achievements but also want to further expand these achievements to continue to march firmly towards communism. They must carry out the Cultural Revolution."

He highly praised the great democracy implemented by China under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

He said, "Great democracy is a further step in socialist democracy, a powerful weapon in the hands of the people, which the people of other countries in the world have never enjoyed."

He said that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible great thought of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader and teacher of the revolutionary people, are determined to defeat and smash everything that obstructs the progress of socialism and revolution.

He expressed his firm belief that the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will certainly be carried out to the end.

He said that Chinese society is undergoing tremendous changes. This is a revolutionary change. Undoubtedly, the society that people will build will be a greater society, which, under the guidance of the great thought of Chairman Mao Zedong, will be even more invincible.

    他说，“大民主是更进一步的社会主义民主，是人民手中的巨大武器，世界上其他任何国家的人民从未享受过这种大民主”。
    他说，由革命人民的领袖和导师毛泽东主席的战无不胜的伟大思想武装起来的中国人民，决心打败和粉碎一切阻碍社会主义和革命前进的东西。
    他表示坚信，中国无产阶级文化大革命必将胜利进行到底。
