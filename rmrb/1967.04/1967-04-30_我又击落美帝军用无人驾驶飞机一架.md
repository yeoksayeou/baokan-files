	Another U.S. Imperialist Military Unmanned Aircraft Shot Down

	The Central Military Commission Issues an Order of Commendation to Praise the Air Force Units That Shot Down a U.S. Plane in Guangxi and Encourage Them to Stay Vigilant and Achieve Greater Victories in Defending the Motherland and the Cultural Revolution

	Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The People's Liberation Army Air Force units today shot down another U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into our airspace for reconnaissance and provocation in the skies over a certain location in Guangxi.

	This is the third enemy aircraft shot down in six days, following the complete annihilation of two intruding U.S. imperialist F-4B fighter jets by our air force units in the skies over a certain location in Guangxi on the 24th. It is also the twelfth U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft shot down by our military since November 1964. The new victory of our heroic People's Liberation Army in shooting down another enemy aircraft further boosts the fighting spirit of the broad masses of revolutionary leftists in our country and is another heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists who are expanding their aggression in Vietnam and plotting new war adventures in Southeast Asia.

	Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The Central Military Commission today issued an order of commendation to praise the People's Liberation Army Air Force units that shot down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft in the skies over a certain location in Guangxi.

	The order of commendation states: This battle was fought well and decisively. It is another victory achieved by you and the broad cadres and fighters of the entire army in enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely carrying out the glorious tasks of supporting the leftist masses, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, while defending our airspace and the proletarian cultural revolution. It is a victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, a victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We extend our warm congratulations to you.

	The order of commendation points out: At a time when the proletarian cultural revolution in our country is in a great and favorable situation, the air force units in Guangxi have achieved consecutive victories in anti-aircraft warfare, severely defeating the U.S. imperialist air pirates who dare to intrude. They shoot down one for every one that comes, and two for every pair that comes, achieving one victory after another. This is the result of the air force units in Guangxi high-spiritedly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, stressing proletarian politics, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. It is the practical action of your resolute response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to grasp the revolution, promote preparedness, promote work, promote production, and support the army and love the people. Your victories have once again dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' war provocations against our country and supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. At the same time, they have further boosted the fighting spirit of the broad masses of revolutionary leftists in our country.

	The order of commendation states: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries, the logic of the modern imperialists and all reactionaries in opposing the people's cause, and they will never deviate from this logic." In the past six days, U.S. imperialist military aircraft have twice intruded into our airspace for provocative activities and have been severely punished. However, the enemy will not be content with their failures and will continue to engage in various forms of sabotage and trouble-making. Therefore, you must guard against arrogance and impatience, continue to strive, further grasp the revolution, promote preparedness, heighten vigilance, and firmly defend your posts. Achieve greater victories in defending our airspace and the proletarian cultural revolution.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　大力突出无产阶级政治
    我又击落美帝军用无人驾驶飞机一架
    中央军委颁发嘉奖令表扬在广西上空击落美机的空军部队；勉励他们提高警惕，在保卫祖国和文化大革命中取得更大胜利
    新华社二十九日讯　中国人民解放军空军部队，今天下午在广西某地上空，又击落了侵入我国领空进行侦察挑衅的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机一架。
    这是继二十四日我空军部队在广西某地上空一举全歼入侵的美帝国主义Ｆ—4Ｂ型战斗机两架以后，在六天的时间内，击落的第三架敌机，也是自一九六四年十一月以来，我军击落的第十二架美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机。我英雄的中国人民解放军再次击落敌机的新胜利，更加鼓舞了我国广大无产阶级革命派的斗争意志，是对正在扩大侵略越南战争和阴谋在东南亚进行新的战争冒险的美帝国主义的又一次沉重打击。
    新华社二十九日讯　中共中央军委今天颁发嘉奖令，表扬在广西某地上空击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机一架的中国人民解放军空军部队。
    嘉奖令说，这次战斗，打得好，打得痛快。这是你们和全军广大指战员在热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决执行支援左派广大群众、支援工业、支援农业、军管、军训等光荣任务的同时，在保卫祖国领空和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，又一次取得的新胜利。这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。特向你们致以热烈的祝贺。
    嘉奖令指出，在我国无产阶级文化大革命正处在一片大好形势下，我空军部队在广西地区的防空作战中，连战连捷，痛歼敢于入侵的美帝国主义空中强盗，来一架打落一架，来两架打落一双，取得了一次又一次的胜利，这是我参战部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化的结果，是你们坚决响应我们伟大领袖毛主席关于抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产和拥军爱民的伟大号召的实际行动。你们的胜利，再一次对美帝国主义向我国进行战争挑衅给予沉重打击，并支援了越南人民的抗美救国战争，同时，更加鼓舞了我国广大无产阶级革命派的斗争意志。
    嘉奖令说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义军用飞机在最近六天之内，连续两次侵入我国领空进行挑衅活动，都受到了严厉惩罚。但是，敌人决不会甘心于他们的失败，还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱。因此，你们务必戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，进一步抓革命，促战备，提高警惕，坚守岗位，在保卫祖国领空和保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，取得更大胜利。
