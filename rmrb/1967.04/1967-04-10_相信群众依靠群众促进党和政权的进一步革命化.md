Comrade Enver Hoxha made an important speech at a joint meeting of the Party's primary organizations in Korabi Coal Mine and other units.

Believe in the Masses and Rely on the Masses to Promote Further Revolutionization of the Party and the Government

It is necessary to strictly implement and adhere to the Party's revolutionary principles; constantly educate cadres in their thinking and politics to make them invincible revolutionaries; realize genuine mass democracy, and resolutely fight against bureaucracy to defend proletarian dictatorship.

New China News Agency, Tirana, April 9 — Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, recently delivered a speech titled "Further Revolutionization of the Party and the Government" at a joint meeting of the Party's primary organizations in Korabi Coal Mine, "Enver Hoxha" Machinery Factory, "V. Pik" Agricultural Cooperative, the 5009th Unit, and the University of Tirana.

Comrade Hoxha said in his speech on February 6 that to further revolutionize the Party, we are waging a great and unending struggle. This struggle has already achieved very good results. The revolutionization of the Party means the revolutionization of Party members. Communist Party members should be as strong as steel. They have clear political stances, are brave, approachable, frank, and sincere, and are very strict when necessary. They should smash all bad things, support and promote advanced new things, and fight for them.

After discussing the good results achieved by Albania in industrial and agricultural production in 1966, Comrade Hoxha said, "The Party teaches us that achievements should not make us Communist Party members complacent. We should not cover up the shortcomings in our work with achievements. We know that the great work of mobilizing the masses by the Party organizations, although it has achieved results, has had and still has shortcomings. The Party should resolutely struggle to overcome these shortcomings."

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that we must never forget that the foundation of our Party is democratic centralism. In our Marxist-Leninist Party, in our fighting proletarian Party, there is no room for political and organizational liberalism and false democracy.

He said, "Our task is to constantly temper the Party, making it always battle-ready, vigorous, and full of vitality, and uncompromising towards shortcomings and defects. Therefore, it is of primary importance for the Party to absorb new blood, to recruit the most outstanding revolutionary elements from the working class, cooperative farmers, and intellectuals."

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the further revolutionization of the Party and the government, the consolidation of the Party and the government, depends on a series of issues.

First of all, it is necessary to strictly implement and adhere to the Party's revolutionary principles and norms.

Our Party is a Marxist-Leninist Party. From the day it was founded, it has attached great importance to democratic centralism, criticism and self-criticism, proletarian democracy, critical analysis of problems, strict secrecy, iron discipline, mass line, class struggle, and so on.

Of course, if we say that everything here has reached the peak and is perfect, that would be arrogance, shortsightedness, and wrong. To be satisfied with the correct resolutions that have been made, to think that those who make resolutions based on the experience of the Party and the state are infallible and cannot be criticized, and thus to adopt an idealistic, mysterious, non-revolutionary, and non-Marxist-Leninist dialectical attitude towards these people, is a wrong idea, a wrong thought. We should believe in, supervise, love, and respect every person who works and struggles correctly and unremittingly on the Party's path, but we should criticize those who make mistakes and make them correct their mistakes. We should not let those who take the path of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialism, no matter who they are, go unpunished. We should expose and strike them ruthlessly without hesitation. We should always proceed from this principle.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that Communist Party members who are afraid of criticism and dare not express their opinions openly, and those who suppress criticism and suppress the opinions of the masses, if they are not bad Party members, are at least not mature and outstanding Communist Party members. If they do not reform themselves and correct their mistakes, they must leave the Party. We do not want such incurable people in the Party.

When talking about the issue of collective supervision and examination, Comrade Hoxha pointed out that everyone, without exception, should put their social labor and performance under the examination of the masses. Communist Party members should be subject to double supervision, that is, the supervision of the Party and the masses.

Comrade Hoxha said, "Our Party of Labour, like every Marxist-Leninist party, is an organized cadre of the working class. This means that only the advanced elements, the best people, the most revolutionary and unyielding people can become Party members. These people are not martyrs for their own interests. They come from the people, are models in labor and struggle, and are examples in morality and conduct. People who join the Party come from all classes of our society, from the working class, cooperative farmers, staff, intellectuals, and other strata. Nevertheless, our Party is not a stage for various classes, not a place where each class has a certain number of representatives to defend the special interests of each class, and so on. No. In our Party, the working class and the ideology of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, are dominant. Although the proportion of workers and Party members of worker origin is still smaller than that of those of peasant origin, the reason is clear to everyone.

Comrade Hoxha said, "The Party of Labour of Albania was born and grew up in a struggle unprecedented in human history and in the history of our people. The fate of our people was once in a state of insecurity, and only a Marxist-Leninist Party like ours could save it, and indeed saved it. Therefore, our Party is a sharp, radiant, unyielding, and unyielding sword in the hands of the working class and the Albanian people. This sword was forged after combining with Marxism-Leninism, tempered in battle, and armed with its own determined rules of war. Under the leadership of the Party, the war of national liberation was won, the people's revolution was realized, and socialist construction is being smoothly carried out. Our Party will continue to fulfill its glorious mission until a communist society is built in our country and the proletarian revolution achieves victory throughout the world.

For today, our Party has gone through countless struggles. It has fought with German, Italian fascism, with the Balli Kombetar and the domestic feudal-bourgeois alliance; it has fought with the Titoites and their agents inside and outside the Party; it has fought with the conspiratorial sabotage of the united imperialists; it has fought with the traitorous Khrushchevites and their agents inside and outside the Party; it has fought with the modern revisionist-fascist alliance led by Khrushchev revisionism.

The enemy has never stopped saying that Albania can only stand and live by relying on others. Of course, this is all nonsense. If we deny the internationalism of the world proletariat, we are not Marxists, but first of all, we must rely on ourselves, defend ourselves, work well, and then rely on the help of others.

In the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, there are many factors that led to the collapse of the socialist system and the degeneration of these countries. But why did these things not happen here? The reasons have been mentioned above, and it is precisely because of these reasons that such things will not happen in the future. The long-term alliance of imperialism and revisionism against the Party of Labour of Albania and Albanian socialism does it exist? This alliance exists, and we have been and are still good. We have fought with them and won, and we will fight with them again and win. It will be the same in the future. Therefore, the final victory belongs to us, to the people of our country and our Party.

Everyone should study the documents of our Party since its founding. We can find rich experience in them. Perhaps these materials are not quite suitable in the philosophical expression forms pursued by intellectuals and literary theorists, perhaps there are some unnecessary and repetitive things, and even errors, but these are documents that have tempered a Party and inspired a small nation's people. Our people are invincible, they never surrender, they have never been conquered, because they are loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Hoxha said, "Modern revisionists and reactionaries say that we are Stalinists, thinking that by doing so they have insulted our mother. Of course, their purpose is to attack us. But on the contrary, they have praised us. To be a Stalinist, we are proud, because to be a Stalinist and act like a Stalinist, the enemy has never been able to conquer us in the past and will never be able to conquer us in the future.

Comrade Hoxha said, "The enemy may say that we are sectarians and terrorists, but we are not shortsighted. When the enemy turns the gun against us, our Party and people will annihilate them.

Comrade Hoxha said, "Our Party has smashed all internal enemies from Anastas Lulo to Lili Belishova. This is a systematic revolutionary struggle. Our Party has never allowed hostile activities within the Party. Our Party has never abandoned the method of patient explanation and persuasion towards those who betray the Party and take the anti-Party, anti-people road, but when there is a definite limit and conclusive facts, the Party will not hesitate to expel them, hand over those who engage in subversion to the court, and some have been shot. The enemy mourns for them, while the people rejoice at the elimination of these traitors.

The opposition within the Party is contrary to the unity of Marxist-Leninist thought and action and attempts to turn the Party into a social democratic party and the socialist state into a capitalist state.

The struggle of our Party is a great school, it makes our Party always keep its ranks pure; although our Party is not a stage for various classes, its members are all advanced elements, but it often carries non-proletarian residues, which must be eliminated and struggled against, this is the form of class struggle that we have always insisted on and should carry out within the Party. In this great struggle, some Party members have been tempered, while others have fallen. Therefore, our Party must constantly educate cadres in their thinking and politics, educate cadres in battle and labor, so that they will always be invincible revolutionaries. From this unique Marxist-Leninist perspective, it can be seen how significant it is to regulate our lives, work, and the struggle of the Party, the people, the Communist Party members, and the non-Party patriots.

For our glorious people, for socialism and communism, we have struggled together with our glorious Party in the past, and we will continue to struggle to the end in the future.

Comrade Hoxha then emphasized that we must always and resolutely oppose bureaucracy.

We should understand that as long as there are classes and class struggle, this struggle will continue and will never end. Why will it continue? Because it is not as some people understand it, that only some simple technical measures are needed, such as reducing personnel, eliminating unnecessary levels in state organs, power organs, economic, cultural departments, or Party organizations, reducing letters and documents, and even correctly defining the powers of individuals and collectives. These measures have played and will continue to play an active and fighting role in the struggle against bureaucracy, but they are not everything. This is a small part, the technical aspect of the problem. If we do not understand its content politically and ideologically, that is, if we do not understand politically and ideologically what bureaucracy is, how it is formed, how its concept is formed, what are its roots, what objective and subjective things nourish it, then these measures may become "bureaucratic measures" again.

People and masses in the world receive two kinds of education and two kinds of treatment. In places where the revolution has won, they receive revolutionary education, while in places where capital rules, they receive bureaucratic education. In the former society, that is, in socialist society, the people have seized power, established proletarian dictatorship, and the Marxist-Leninist Party has seized power. The line of the Party, the mass line has seized power. Here there is broad and genuine democracy of the masses, and there is no reactionary democracy of the ruling class, oppressors, minorities, and enemies of the masses. While in capitalist-ruled countries, there is the democracy of capitalists, oppressors, and exploiters, and the majority, the masses, the people are oppressed. Here there is bourgeois dictatorship, fascist dictatorship, and the rule of bureaucracy.

In places where the revolution has won, bureaucracy was defeated in the first round, but it did not lay down its arms and instead fought in other forms. The roots of these forms are the traditions of the old system; while the sins of the old system still have an impact, especially in ideas, prejudices, and people's worldviews.

Comrade Hoxha said, "We have fundamentally smashed the old bureaucratic power of feudal capitalism and fascism, and established proletarian dictatorship and people's assembly power. We cannot say that there are no manifestations of certain old leadership methods in our new people's power. The fact is that for more than twenty years, we have improved our power, made it democratic, and made it closer to the masses of the people. However, we still need to continue the struggle in this regard, so that our power is democratic not only in form and organization but especially in content and substance.

He said, "To successfully fight against bureaucracy and bureaucrats, we should deeply understand and resolutely implement the Party's instructions, especially the Party's instructions on 'power is the power of the masses,' 'further approach the masses,' 'implement broad democracy of the masses,' and so on."

Comrade Hoxha said, "Our elections are essentially people's and revolutionary. The representatives of the People's Assembly and the People's Parliament are the people's people. They maintain contact with the people and are elected and recalled by the people. They formulate revolutionary laws beneficial to the people, they themselves abide by and implement these socialist revolutionary laws, decrees, and norms with the people. If these laws and decrees are inappropriate, outdated, and erroneous, then the broad masses of the people have the right to abolish and amend them.

In the situation of people's democracy, the role and tasks of our representatives are not just to maintain formal contact with voters once or twice a year and to execute laws and decisions bureaucratically in their work posts. He is a representative of the broad masses of the people and at the same time one of them. They not only abide by but also formulate decisions, discuss laws and decisions, criticize, suggest, and amend them. The true struggle against the concept of bureaucracy lies in deeply understanding and well implementing these laws and decisions. This is the battlefield where revolutionaries fight against bureaucrats, those who connect with the masses fight against bureaucrats, heroes fight against cowards, and those who struggle for the Party to be closely connected with the masses of the people fight against those who try to separate the Party from the people.

Those who are afraid of the masses are bureaucrats, not revolutionaries. Fear is an individualistic thing, not a mass thing. It may expose itself to the masses for a moment and create temporary panic, but the masses are afraid of nothing.

Bureaucrats are afraid because their worldview is idealistic, mysterious, and individualistic. Pride, flattery, lying, and cheating, and all other evils come from this, and all this is to maintain one's own position, to climb up, to illegally make profits, to scheme against each other. Obviously, such goods cannot withstand the gaze of the masses, the struggle of the masses, and the revolutionary tide of the masses, so bureaucrats always try to evade revolutionary norms, attempt to make revolutionary laws and decrees ineffective, cause the masses to be discontented and dissatisfied, and finally adopt a hands-off attitude. Bureaucrats try to turn state organs into closed, administrative, and reactionary tools, turning them into administrative organs that serve bureaucracy, intimidate and suppress the masses, rather than serve the people and fight against bureaucracy.

We should settle accounts with those dangerous bureaucrats who try to turn bureaucracy into a system or maintain bureaucratic customs, especially bureaucrats in power organs and Party organizations, in economic, industrial enterprises, cooperative leadership, and educational and cultural institutions.

Bureaucrats are afraid of the masses, afraid of doing mass work. When they have to go to the masses, they hope to be in power and impose their opinions on the masses with their authority and position. They distort the revolutionary democratic essence of power and law. They destroy democracy, suppress criticism, and under the pretext of defending some "instructions" or laws, maintain the prestige of the Party and the state. In fact, the opposite is true. They have trampled on the prestige of the Party and the state and, with hidden and sometimes open purposes, pour cold water on the masses, making the masses leave the Party.

Comrade Hoxha said, "How can a Marxist-Leninist Party be afraid of the masses, afraid of the voice and criticism of the masses? If it is afraid, it is not a Marxist-Leninist Party. The Party has never been afraid, but some individuals, some Party members, some state workers are afraid. Bureaucrats are afraid of the masses. They use the prestige of the Party and the power to suppress the voice of the masses.

The people led by the Party, the working class, and its glorious Party of Labour will be afraid of a handful of rotten people? This is unimaginable. Such a thing cannot be imagined even for a second.

We must never forget the tragedy of the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Party and the working class, the masses of the people should always be ready to defend proletarian dictatorship and its laws, thoughts, policies, and fruits at all costs. This is the only correct, healthy, and salvational path taught by our Party. Our Party teaches us all, without exception, to follow this path thoroughly.

There are only two paths: either stand with the Party and the people, or oppose the Party and the people. Therefore, everything outside the laws and norms of the Party and the people is not allowed; everything escapes the vigilant eyes of the Party and the people; no one is allowed to report their work to the Party and the people; no one is allowed to steal the merits of the Party and the people.

He said, "The current very ridiculous wall newspapers should be abolished and turned into revolutionary wall newspapers that are beneficial to revolutionary education. Overthrow the editorial boards composed of revisionist literati that support the directors and their personal 'dignity and prestige,' and anyone can write big-character posters about their views on work and people without any hesitation.

Perhaps someone will say: 'We should maintain the prestige of the cadres. If we do this, it will damage the reputation of the cadres.' This means that such people first think that cadres do not make mistakes in judging problems, while the masses make mistakes. Such thinking is a very serious mistake and is not thinking about problems in the way a Marxist and revolutionary should. Good cadres, no one will slander him, and on the contrary, everyone loves him and protects him.

What is wrong with the masses openly criticizing cadres who make mistakes, and what regulations are violated? There is only good, no bad. Why should we suppress and weaken criticism from below under the pretext of 'maintaining the prestige of cadres'? What harm does this do to the Party? If we make mistakes, that will bring a lot of harm to the Party. The prestige of the Party among the masses will be reduced, and we will damage the Party by retaining and protecting unworthy Party members, which will harm the education of the Party.

Sometimes, when taking measures against experienced and knowledgeable cadres, there is always hesitation. If this cadre makes mistakes repeatedly, then this is a very wrong thing to do. In this case, we should see that good work methods and revolutionary behavior are not always connected with the abilities of cadres, but are connected with the political thoughts and worldviews of cadres.

Therefore, educating cadres and people with revolutionary spirit is a major and constant task, because the good or bad of the work in this aspect determines the victory or defeat of the struggle against bureaucracy and bureaucrats.

If we carefully observe bureaucrats, we will find that they have not studied Marxist-Leninist theory well, and their work is dominated by subjectivism. They are very insistent on their own opinions. They are arrogant and at the same time flattering. They are arrogant to the masses and bow to their superiors.

Bureaucrats cover their ignorance with rhetoric and sensational words. They regard the long-held and unchangeable leadership positions as their private property. They even think that they are untouchable, irreplaceable, and that they have done enough work around them and created the 'they have abilities' theory. They do not see the danger of demotion or transfer. They only think about climbing up, and they work just to get promoted.

This non-revolutionary viewpoint makes them think that 'the position they occupy is stable,' 'they will not make mistakes in their work,' 'their work methods and style are perfect.' This makes them reach such a point that in the range of people's democracy, in the family and society, a new type of bourgeois ideology and way of life is formed. This is very dangerous. If we do not burn these views of bureaucrats, they will spread these views to us under the pretext of prestige and infect us.

Therefore, in addition to generally educating cadres and the masses in political thought and taking various forms to oppose the manifestations of bureaucracy, I think we should more seriously study and correctly implement the rotation of cadres, because some of our cadres have been in one place for ten to fifteen years. In this way, they consciously or unconsciously acquire some characteristics of the people I mentioned above. Replacing them with grassroots people is beneficial to the Party, to the higher power organs, to the grassroots, and also to those who are transferred to the grassroots.

For the overall interests, we should also bravely take steps to narrow the wage gap between workers and peasants and workers. This is the correct Marxist-Leninist path. This measure must also be linked to the creation of abundant economic wealth, which is also Marxist-Leninist.

Comrade Hoxha finally said, "All this poses arduous tasks for the further revolutionization of the Party's work. The great achievements in the work of our Party should not make us complacent and close our eyes to the shortcomings and unneglectable weaknesses that exist. If we do not bravely go further and implement the mass line, genuine mass democracy, if we do not go further and resolutely implement the Party's norms, democratic centralism, not bureaucratic centralism, Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, proletarian discipline and morality in a revolutionary way, it will cause serious losses.

We will strengthen our Party, and we should advance on this correct path, so that our Party, socialism, and the people of our country will not be worried about anything.

We have all the possibilities to do this because our Party is strong, tempered, and has rich revolutionary experience, because we have brave and fearless Party members and excellent people who are closely connected with the Party.

    霍查同志在科拉比煤矿等单位党基层组织联合举行的会议上作重要报告
    相信群众依靠群众促进党和政权的进一步革命化
    必须严格地贯彻和遵守党的革命的原则；不断在思想上、政治上对干部进行教育，使他们成为不可战胜的革命者；实现真正的群众民主，同官僚主义进行坚决斗争，保卫无产阶级专政。
    新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志不久前在科拉比煤矿、“霍查”机械厂、“威·皮克”农业合作社、五○○九部队和地拉那大学等单位党基层组织联合举行的会议上，作了题为《党和政权的进一步革命化》的报告。
    霍查同志在二月六日所作的这个报告中说，为了党的进一步革命化，我们正在进行一场巨大的和不断的斗争。这一斗争已经取得了非常好的效果。党的革命化就意味着党员的革命化。共产党员应当是象钢铁般坚强的战士。他们有明确的政治态度，勇敢、可亲、坦率、真诚，在必要的时候又非常严厉。他们应当打碎一切坏东西，支持和促进先进的新事物，并为之而奋斗。
    霍查同志在谈到阿尔巴尼亚一九六六年在工农业生产方面所取得的良好成绩后说，党教导我们，成绩决不应使我们共产党员陶醉起来。我们决不应该用成绩掩盖我们工作中的缺点。我们知道，党组织进行的动员群众的巨大工作，虽然取得了成绩，但过去和现在都有缺点。党应该为克服这些缺点坚决进行斗争。
    霍查同志指出，我们一刻也不应该忘记，我们党的基础是民主集中制，在我们马克思列宁主义党内，在我们无产阶级的战斗的党内不允许有政治上和组织上的自由主义堕落和假民主。
    他说，我们的任务是不断锤炼党，使它永远战斗化，有活力，生气勃勃，并对缺点和缺陷毫不调和。因此，党的队伍吸收新的血液，从工人阶级、合作社农民和知识分子中吸收最出色的革命分子入党，具有首要意义。
    霍查同志指出，党和政权机关的进一步革命化，党和政权的巩固取决于一系列的问题。
    首先是严格地贯彻和遵守党的革命的原则和准则。
    我们党是一个马克思列宁主义的党，从它建立的那天起，就十分重视民主集中制，批评和自我批评，无产阶级民主，对问题进行批判性的分析，严守机密，钢铁般的和自觉的纪律，群众路线，阶级斗争等等。
    当然，如果说我们这里一切都已达到顶点，一切都是完美无缺的，那就是骄傲自满，鼠目寸光，那是错误的。
    满足于已经作出的正确决议，认为那些根据党和国家的经验作出决议的人是没有错误的，是批评不得的，因而对这些人采取唯心主义的，神秘的，非革命的，非马克思列宁主义的辩证态度，这是一种错误的思想，一种错误的想法。应该相信、监督、热爱和尊重每一个在党的道路上孜孜不倦、坚持不懈正确地劳动和斗争的人，但对那些犯了错误的人要给予批评，令其改正，决不放过对走上反党、反人民、反社会主义的敌对道路的人，不管他是谁，要毫不犹豫地给予揭露和无情的严厉的打击。我们任何时候都应该从这个原则出发。
    霍查同志指出，害怕批评、不敢公开发表意见的共产党员和压制批评、压制群众意见的共产党员，如果说不是坏党员，那至少不能算是成熟的和优秀的共产党员。如果他们不自我改造，不改正，就必须离开党，不能要这种不可救药的人在党内充数。
    霍查同志在谈到集体的监督、检验问题时指出，所有的人，无一例外，都要把自己的社会劳动和表现置于群众的检验之下。共产党员要受双重监督，即党和群众的监督。
    霍查同志说，我们的劳动党，正象每一个马克思列宁主义的政党一样，是工人阶级有组织的队伍。这就是说，只有先进分子，最优秀的人，最革命的和最坚强不屈的人才能成为党员。这些人不是为自己的爱好而捐躯，他们来自人民，在劳动和斗争中是表率，在品德和行为上是模范。入党的人是来自我国社会的各个阶级，来自工人阶级、社员、职员、知识分子和其他阶层。尽管如此，我们党却不是各种阶级的会演舞台，不是每一个阶级都在这里有一定数额的代表来捍卫每个阶级自己的特殊利益，等等。不是的。在我们党内占统治地位的是工人阶级和工人阶级的思想，是马克思列宁主义。尽管党内工人出身和工人党员的比重比农民出身的尚小，其原因大家也都清楚。
    霍查同志说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是在人类和我国人民闻所未闻的残酷斗争中诞生和成长的。我国人民的命运曾经处于无保障的状态，只有象我们党这样的马克思列宁主义的党才能拯救它，而且也真的拯救了它。所以我们党是工人阶级和阿尔巴尼亚人民手中的锋利的、光芒四射的、永不弯折和永不屈从的宝剑。这是在同马克思列宁主义相结合以后，在战斗中经受锻炼以后并以自己确定的战争准则武装以后才铸成了这样一把宝剑。在党的领导下，民族解放战争取得了胜利，实现了人民革命，并顺利地进行着社会主义建设。我党将继续完成它的崇高使命，直到在我国建成共产主义社会，无产阶级革命在全世界取得胜利。
    为了今天，我们党不知经过了多少斗争。它和德、意法西斯进行了搏斗，和巴里分子以及本国的封建资产阶级联盟进行了斗争；它和铁托分子及其在我党内外的代理人进行了斗争；它和联合起来的帝国主义分子的阴谋破坏进行了斗争；它和赫鲁晓夫叛徒分子及其在我党内外的代理人进行了斗争；它和以赫鲁晓夫修正主义为首的现代修正主义法西斯联盟进行了斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚能站住脚，能生活，这全靠别人。这样的话敌人从未少说，当然，这全是胡说八道。如果否认世界无产阶级的国际主义支持，那就不是马克思主义者，但是首先要自己进行斗争，自己起来自卫，自己工作好，然后才是别人的帮助。
    在苏联和其他人民民主国家，导致社会主义制度的覆灭和这些国家的蜕变的因素很多。但在我们这里为什么没有发生这些事件呢？理由我在上面也已谈到，并且也正是由于这些原因，在将来也不会发生任何事件。长期反对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的帝国主义和修正主义联盟难道不存在吗？这一联盟是存在的，而我们过去和现在也还是好好的。我们和他们较量过，并取得了胜利，重新和他们较量，也会取得胜利。以后也是如此。所以最后的胜利是属于我们的，是属于我国人民和我们党的。
    大家都要研究我党成立以来的文件，我们可以从中找到丰富的经验。可能这些材料在知识分子和文体论者所追求的哲学表达形式方面不尽合适，可能还有些不必要的、重复的东西，甚至还会有错误，但是这都是一些锻炼了一个党和鼓舞了一个小国人民的文件，我们的人民是不可战胜的，他们从不屈服，从未被征服，因为他们忠于马克思列宁主义准则。
    霍查同志说，现代修正主义者和反动派说我们是斯大林分子，认为这样就算骂了我们的娘，当然其目的就是要攻击我们。但是正相反，这样他们正好称颂了我们。做一个斯大林分子，我们感到光荣，因为作斯大林分子并象斯大林分子那样行动，敌人过去没有也永远不能征服我们。
    霍查同志说，敌人可能说我们是宗派主义和恐怖分子，但我们不是鼠目寸光的人，敌人掉过枪来反对我们，我们党和人民就把他们消灭无遗。
    霍查同志说，我党粉碎了从阿纳斯塔斯·卢洛到丽莉·贝利绍娃的内部的一切敌人。这是一场系统的革命的斗争。我党从不允许在党内进行敌对活动，我党从未放弃对叛党和走上反党反人民道路的人进行耐心的解释、说服的工作方法，但到了一定限度并有确凿的事实时党就毫不犹豫地清除他们，把进行颠覆的人提交法庭，有些则被枪毙了。敌人为他们吊丧，而人民则为除掉了这些叛徒而高兴。
    党内的反对派是同马克思列宁主义的思想行动的一致相违背的，并企图把党变为社会民主党，把社会主义国家变为资本主义国家。
    我党的斗争是一所大学校，它使我党永远保持自己队伍的纯洁；虽然我党不是各阶级的舞台，其党员都是先进分子，但是也常带有非无产阶级的残余，对这些残余要加以清除和斗争，这就是我们一贯坚持的和应当在党内开展的阶级斗争形式。在这场伟大的斗争中，一部分党员经受了锻炼，一部分倒下了。所以我党要不断在思想上、政治上对干部进行教育，在战斗中和劳动中教育干部，使他们永远成为不可战胜的革命者。从这唯一的马克思列宁主义的角度出发观察问题，可以看出调节我们的生活、工作和党的斗争、人民的斗争、共产党员的斗争和无党派爱国人士的斗争的准则有着多么重大的意义。
    为了我们光荣的人民，为了社会主义和共产主义，我们过去同领导我们的光荣的党一起进行了斗争，今后将继续斗争到底。
    霍查同志接着强调指出，必须始终不渝和坚决地反对官僚主义。
    应该懂得，只要存在阶级和阶级斗争，这场斗争就将继续下去，永远不会结束。为什么将继续下去呢？因为它并不象某些人所理解的那样，只要采取一些简单的技术措施就行了，如缩减人员，取消在国家机关、政权机构、经济、文化部门或者党组织中的不必要的层次，减少信件和公文，直至最正确地规定个人和集体的职权。这些措施对反官僚主义已经起到并将继续起积极的和战斗的作用，但并不是全部。这是一小部分，是问题的技术方面，如果不从政治上和思想上理解它的内容，也就是说如果不从政治上和思想上理解什么是官僚主义，它是怎样形成的，怎样形成了它的概念，根源何在，什么主客观的东西滋养着它，那么这些措施有可能再变为“官僚主义的措施”。
    人民和群众在世界上受两种教育和两种待遇。革命取得胜利的地方，受到革命的教育，而资本统治的地方，则受官僚教育。在前一种社会里，即社会主义社会，人民掌握了政权，建立了无产阶级专政，马克思列宁主义党掌握了政权，党的路线，群众路线掌握了政权。这里有广大群众的广泛的和真正的民主，而没有反动的当权派、压迫者、少数派和群众的敌人的民主。而在资本统治的国家，有的是资本家、压迫者和剥削者的民主，而对大多数人，对群众，对人民进行压迫。这里有的是资产阶级专政，法西斯专政，官僚制度的统治。
    革命取得胜利的地方，官僚主义在第一个回合中打了败仗，但它并没有放下武器，而是采用其他形式进行斗争，这些形式的根源是旧制度的传统；而旧制度留下的罪孽至今还有影响，特别是在观念、偏见和人们的世界观中。
    霍查同志说，我们从根本上打碎了封建资产阶级和法西斯主义的旧的官僚政权，建立了无产阶级专政和人民会议政权。我们不能说在我们新的人民政权内，不存在这样或那样的旧的领导工作方式的某些表现。事实是，二十几年以来，我们改进了我们的政权，使它民主化，并使它更进一步地接近人民群众。但是，我们仍然应该在这方面进行不断的斗争，使我们的政权不仅仅在形式上和机构上，而且特别在内容和实质上也是民主的。
    他说，为了胜利地反对官僚主义和官僚主义者，应该深刻理解并坚决执行党的指示，特别是党关于“政权是群众的政权”，“更进一步接近群众”，“实行群众的广泛的民主”等指示。
    霍查同志说，我们的选举在本质上是人民的、革命的。人民会议和人民议会的代表是人民的人，他们同人民保持联系，并由人民推选和撤销。他们制订对人民有利的革命法律，他们自己遵守并同人民一起贯彻这些社会主义的革命的法律、法令和准则。如果这些法律和法令不合适、过时了和错误的，那么广大人民群众有权予以废除和加以修改。
    在人民民主情况下，我们的代表的作用和任务不仅仅是在形式上每年同选民保持一次或两次接触，以及在工作岗位上官僚主义地执行法令和决议。他是广大人民群众的代表，同时又是他们中间的一员，他们不仅遵守而且制订决定、讨论法令和决议，对它提出批评、建议和加以修改。反对官僚主义概念的真正的斗争就在于深刻理解和很好执行这些法令和决议。这是革命者同官僚主义者，联系群众的人同官僚主义者，勇士和懦夫，为党同人民群众紧密联系而奋斗的人同企图使党脱离人民的人进行搏斗的大战场。
    害怕群众的是官僚主义者，而不是革命者。怕是个人主义的东西，而不是群众的东西。它可能向群众作瞬间的暴露，并制造暂时的恐慌，但群众是什么也不怕的。
    官僚主义者害怕，是因为他的世界观是唯心的，神秘的，个人主义的。骄傲自大、卑躬屈膝、撒谎欺骗等一切弊病都由此而来，所有这一切都是为了保住个人既得的地位，往上爬，非法牟利，尔虞我诈。显然，这种货色抵挡不住群众的眼光、群众的斗争和群众的革命热潮，因此官僚主义者总是千方百计想逃避革命准则，妄图使革命的法律和法令失去作用，引起群众的厌倦和不满，最后采取袖手旁观的态度。官僚主义者企图把国家机关变成封闭的、行政的和反动的工具，把它变成为官僚主义服务，恫吓和压制群众，而不是为人民服务和反对官僚主义的行政机构。
    我们应该向那些企图把官僚主义变为体制，或者保持官僚主义风气的危险的官僚主义者算账，并同他们进行斗争，特别是在政权机关和党组织中，在经济、工业企业、合作社领导干部中和教育文化机关方面的官僚主义者。
    官僚主义者害怕群众，害怕做群众工作，当他不得不到群众中去时，便希望能做当权派，以自己的权势和地位把意见强加给群众。他歪曲政权、法律的革命的民主实质。他破坏民主，压制批评，借口保卫什么“指示”或法律，维护什么党和国家的威信。事实上正相反，他糟踏了党和国家的威信，并带着不可告人的、隐蔽的和有时是公开的目的向群众泼冷水，使群众离开党。
    霍查同志说，马克思列宁主义党怎么能害怕群众、害怕群众的呼声和批评呢？怕就不配称为马克思列宁主义的党。党从来是不怕的，害怕的是某些个别人，某些党员，某些国家工作人员；官僚主义者才害怕群众，他们利用党和政权的威信压制群众呼声。
    党领导的人民群众，工人阶级及其光荣的劳动党会害怕一小撮烂掉了的人？这是不可思议的。这样的事连一秒钟都不能想象。
    我们永远都不能忘记苏联的悲剧。在党和工人阶级领导下，人民群众应该时刻起来准备不惜一切来保卫无产阶级专政，及其法律、思想、政策和果实。这是我们党教导我们的唯一正确的、健全的拯救性的道路。我党教导我们大家无一例外地彻底遵循这条道路。
    只有两条道路：要末同党和人民站在一起，要末反对党和人民。因此，党和人民的法令和准则以外的一切都是不容许的；一切都逃避不了党和人民的警惕的眼睛；不允许任何人不向党和人民汇报自己的工作，不允许任何人窃取党和人民的功绩。
    他说，目前的十分可笑的墙报应当取消了，把它办成有利于革命教育的革命墙报。推翻维护厂长和他们个人“尊严、威信”的由修正主义文人组成的编委会，任何人都可以毫无顾虑地把他对工作，对人们的看法用大字报写出来。
    也许有人会说：“我们应当维护干部的威信。如果这样做，会损害干部的声誉”。这就是说，这样想的人，首先认为在判断问题方面干部是不犯错误的，而群众才会犯错误。这样想是非常严重的错误，不是象一个马克思主义者和革命者那样去思考问题。工作好的干部，没有谁会中伤他，而且恰恰相反，大家热爱他，保护他。
    群众对犯错误的干部进行公开的批评，这有什么坏处，又违犯了什么规定呢？只有好处，没有坏处。为什么我们要借口“维护干部威信”而压制和削弱来自下面的批评呢？这样的事情对党有什么坏处呢？如果我们做错了，那才会给党带来很多损失。党在群众中的威信就会降低，我们就要败坏党，在党内保留和保护了不配作党员的人，就会损害党的教育。
    有时，对资格老，经验多的干部采取措施时，总是犹豫不决。如果这个干部一再犯错误时，那这样做是非常错误的。在这种情况下，我们应当看到，好的工作方法和革命的行为并不总是和干部的才能相联系的，而是和干部的政治思想和世界观联系在一起的。
    所以以革命精神教育干部和教育人，是一件重大的、经常的任务，因为在这方面工作的好坏，决定了反对官僚主义和官僚主义者的斗争的胜败。
    如果我们对官僚主义者仔细加以观察，那么就会发现，他们没有很好地研究马克思列宁主义理论，统治他们工作的是主观主义。他们很坚持自己的意见。他们是狂妄自大的人，同时又是阿谀奉承的人，对群众飞扬跋扈，对上司低头哈腰。
    官僚主义者用词藻和耸人听闻的言词掩盖自己的无知。他们把长期占有的不能变动的领导位置当作自己的私有财产。他们甚至认为自己是碰不得的，替换不得的，认为在自己周围已经做了足够工作，并制造
  “他们有才能”的论调。他们看不到有降职、调任的危险。他想的只是向上爬，他们工作就是为了升官。
    这种非革命的观点使他们认为“自己占据的位子是稳定的”，“他们在工作中是不会犯错误的”，“他们的工作方法、作风是完善的”。这样就使他们达到如此地步，以至于在人民民主范围内，在家庭和社会中形成一种新型资产阶级的思想和生活方式。这是非常危险的。假如我们不火烧官僚主义者的这些观点，那么他就要假借威望而向我们散布这些观点，使我们受感染。
    因此，除了对干部和群众进行一般的政治思想教育和采取反对官僚主义表现的多种多样的方式以外，我认为，我们应当更严肃地研究和进一步正确贯彻干部的轮调，因为我们有些干部老呆在一个地方，有十——十五年多了。这样，他们自觉或不自觉地就沾染了上面我说的那些人的一些特点。用基层的人代替他们，对党，对上级政权机关，对基层都有好处，对下放到基层的人也有利。
    为了整体的利益，我们还要勇敢地向缩小工农和职工之间的工资差别迈进。这是正确的马克思列宁主义的道路。这一措施还必须同创造丰富的经济财富联系起来，这也是马克思列宁主义的。
    霍查同志最后说，所有这一切为党的工作的进一步革命化提出了艰巨的任务。我们党的工作中取得了巨大的成就，这不应当使我们陶醉，闭上眼睛不看缺点和存在的不容忽视的弱点。如果不勇敢地进一步深入和贯彻群众路线、真正的群众民主，如果不进一步深入并坚决地以革命的方式把党的准则、民主集中制而不是官僚集中制、布尔什维克的批评和自我批评、无产阶级的纪律和道德贯彻到底，那将造成严重损失。
    我们将加强我们的党，我们应当在这条正确的道路上前进，使我们党、社会主义和我国人民不为任何事情担忧。
    我们有着一切可能做到这点，因为我们的党是坚强的，经受过锻炼的，有着丰富的革命经验，因为我们有着英勇无畏的党员和与党紧密相连的优秀人民。
