Japanese Revolutionary Journalists Congratulate the Establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee

New China News Agency, April 27th

According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, Japanese revolutionary journalists sent a telegram on April 24th to congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The telegram stated:

"The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee in the unprecedented storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is 'a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the greatest inspiration for the revolutionary people of the world.'"

The telegram, passed at the gathering celebrating the "Day of Asian and African Journalists" in Tokyo, said: "Beijing is not only the location of the headquarters of the Chinese proletarian revolution led by our great leader, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, but also the beacon of hope and light for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world in their struggle for liberation."

The telegram said that the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Beijing and throughout China, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, "It is reasonable to rebel," have, in the unprecedented Great Cultural Revolution, displayed revolutionary heroism of "daring to struggle, daring to win," and achieved decisive victories over the class enemies.

The telegram said: "All the imperialists, reactionaries, and revisionists of the world are in a state of panic and terror in front of you." A small group of revisionists in Japan, together with American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, are also joining in the abuse.

The telegram concluded: "As Chairman Mao said, 'All reactionaries are paper tigers.' We firmly believe that no matter how tortuous and difficult the future of the struggle may be, if we persist in the struggle and advance with Mao Zedong Thought, the final victory will definitely belong to the people. We will definitely combine Mao Zedong Thought with practice, study Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently, and hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. We will march forward side by side with our Chinese comrades on the revolutionary road!"

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　革命人民的最大鼓舞
    日本革命新闻工作者祝贺北京市革命委员会成立
    新华社二十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命的新闻工作者在二十四日发出的祝贺北京市革命委员会成立的电报中说：
    北京市革命委员会在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中诞生，“是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是对全世界革命人民的最大鼓舞。”
    日本革命新闻工作者在东京庆祝“亚非新闻工作者日”集会上通过的这封贺电说：“北京不仅是我们伟大领袖、我们时代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席所领导的中国无产阶级革命最高司令部的所在地，而且是全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的希望和灯塔。”
    贺电说，北京市和全中国无产阶级革命派的同志们，遵循着伟大的毛主席的“造反有理”的教导，在历史上空前的文化大革命中，发扬了“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”的革命英雄主义，赢得了对阶级敌人的决定性胜利。
    贺电说：“全世界的帝国主义者、反动派和修正主义者，在你们的面前，惊慌失措，吓得脸都变了色。”日本的一小撮修正主义分子，也和美帝国主义、日本反动派一起，同声谩骂。
    贺电最后说：“但是，正如毛主席所说：‘一切反动派都是纸老虎’。我们坚信：不管斗争的前途多么曲折，多么困难重重，如果坚持斗争，坚持毛泽东思想前进，最后胜利一定是属于人民的。我们一定把毛泽东思想和实践结合起来，更加努力地学习毛泽东思想，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和中国同志们沿着革命的道路，并肩前进！”
