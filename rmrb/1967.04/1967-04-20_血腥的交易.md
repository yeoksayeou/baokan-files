    Bloody Dealings
    Over forty years ago, Lenin condemned American imperialism for profiting from war with great indignation, saying, "Every dollar is stained with blood." Who would have thought that today, the Soviet revisionist clique would make the ruble the same way, and that it would be stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people!

    According to American publications, the Soviet revisionist clique has already supplied large quantities of rare strategic materials such as magnesium to American imperialism for the production of napalm bombs and aircraft, to massacre the Vietnamese people. They are delivering these supplies at a time when the American imperialists are urgently producing bandit aircraft and modern bombs but lack this important raw material. Look, to what extent have these traitors fallen!

    The Soviet revisionist clique has been loudly proclaiming that they are supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation. In fact, they are supporting the Vietnamese people's enemy, American imperialism!

    The Soviet revisionist clique has been hypocritically denouncing American imperialism's savage bombing of Vietnam as "barbaric atrocities." In fact, they are actively helping the American aggressors commit these barbaric acts!

    Of course, there is nothing surprising about this.

    Since the Soviet revisionist clique adheres to the principle of "rubles first, profits first," in their eyes, if there is profit to be made, it is a "fair deal," money in one hand, goods in the other. They don't care about magnesium, tungsten, barium, titanium, or uranium.

    Since the Soviet revisionist clique wants to engage in "comprehensive cooperation" with American imperialism, in their eyes, this kind of "mutual exchange" of "economic cooperation" is indispensable. They don't care about who benefits and who is harmed.

    Since the Soviet revisionist clique is falsely supporting and truly betraying the Vietnamese people, in their eyes, helping American imperialism produce more aircraft and bombs to intensify the policy of "bombing to force submission" is not completely in line with their goal of extinguishing the revolutionary flames in Vietnam?

    The Vietnamese people are bravely fighting a bloody battle against American imperialist aggressors to achieve victory in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation. The Soviet revisionist leadership, however, is using the blood of the Vietnamese people to do business with American imperialism. How despicable, detestable, and hateful! For the sake of serving American imperialism, since they can do such despicable and dirty deeds, what other more shameful acts of betrayal can they not do?

### 血腥的交易

    血腥的交易
    列宁在四十多年前谴责美帝国主义大发战争横财的时候，无比愤怒地说过：“每一块美元都有血迹”。没想到今天苏修叛徒集团使卢布也成了这个样子，而且它上面沾染的竟是越南人民的鲜血！
    据美国报刊透露，苏修集团已经把大量稀有战略物资镁，供给美帝国主义制造凝固汽油弹和飞机，去屠杀越南人民。他们是在美帝急需赶制强盗飞机和现代化炸弹，而又缺乏这种重要原料的情况下，送货上门的。请看，这些叛徒已经堕落到何等地步了。
    苏修集团不是口口声声地说他们在支援越南人民抗美救国斗争吗？事实上他们支援的却是越南人民的死敌美帝国主义！
    苏修集团不是装模作样地指责美帝国主义对越南狂轰滥炸是什么“野蛮暴行”吗？事实上他们却在积极帮助美国侵略者去干这种野蛮暴行！
    当然，这并没有什么奇怪的。
    苏修集团既然奉行卢布挂帅、利润第一的原则，那末在他们看来，有利便可图，一手交钱，一手交货，这是“公平交易”，管他什么镁、钨、钡、钛、铀。
    苏修集团既然要同美帝国主义搞“全面合作”，那末在他们看来，这种“互通有无”的“经济合作”就是不可缺少的，还管什么对谁有利，对谁有害呢？
    苏修集团既然对越南人民假支持，真出卖，那末在他们看来，帮助美帝国主义多制造一些飞机、炸弹，加紧实行“以炸迫和”，不是完全符合其扑灭越南革命烈火的目的吗？
    越南人民为了争取抗美救国事业的胜利，正在同美帝国主义侵略者进行英勇的浴血战斗，而苏修领导集团竟然拿越南人民的鲜血来同美帝国主义做交易，这是多么的可鄙，可恶，可恨！他们为了给美帝国主义效劳，既然连这种卑鄙肮脏的勾当都做得出，还有什么更可耻的叛卖行径干不出来呢？
