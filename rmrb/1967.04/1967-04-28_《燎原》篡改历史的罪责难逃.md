The capitalist-roader in power within the Party, who has long harbored ambitions to usurp the Party, the military, and the government, has used various opportunities and propaganda tools to serve his ambitions. He shamelessly directed writers to create more literary works about miners' struggles, essentially asking them to sing his praises. His subordinates, large and small, responded eagerly, and works praising the capitalist-roader in power within the Party emerged one after another. Before the reactionary film "Sparking the Prairie Fire" was released, in 1961, the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio produced a documentary film titled "A Glorious Page of Anshan Coal Mine." This documentary, through a series of scenes and narration, portrayed the capitalist-roader in power within the Party as the savior of the Anshan miners, claiming that he "took on the role of representing over 13,000 miners in the mine, resolutely entering the main building to face off against the capitalists," and that the "two phoenix trees he personally nurtured are now lush and green." Following this, in 1963, the reactionary feature film "Sparking the Prairie Fire" was released, which completely distorted the history of the Anshan miners' heroic struggle under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. It attributed the immortal achievements of our red sun, Chairman Mao, to this fake revolutionary and counter-revolutionary capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The film attempted to use the tricks of stealing fame and distorting history to prepare public opinion for this Khrushchev-like great conspirator to usurp the Party and the state.

Anshan Coal Mine is a mine with a glorious revolutionary tradition. This piece of red land was personally pioneered by our great leader Chairman Mao. In the winter of 1921, our great leader Chairman Mao came to Anshan, went down into the mine to befriend the miners, and spread revolutionary ideas, sowing the seeds of revolution in Anshan. After returning to Changsha, Chairman Mao immediately sent Party cadres to Anshan to organize the workers' movement. Chairman Mao instructed them to establish a foothold there, gain legal status, and start by setting up a supplementary school. Thus, in May 1922, the workers established their own fighting organization—the Anshan Mining Workers' Club. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, from the end of 1921 to 1922, a nationwide wave of workers' strikes was launched. At this time, the Anshan Workers' Club, nourished by Chairman Mao's thoughts, grew rapidly. In just two months, the club's membership had grown to over 700. The club's growing influence terrified the capitalists. They tried to bribe workers with money, threaten them with death, and finally even requested that the pseudo-Pingxiang County order the closure of the club, attempting to strangle the burgeoning workers' movement. At this critical juncture, Chairman Mao came to Anshan for the second time on September 8, 1922.

After Chairman Mao arrived in Anshan and further understood and studied the situation, he decided that the conditions for a major strike were ripe and made the decisive decision to go on strike. Chairman Mao also taught everyone that in the struggle against the enemy, one must be bold and cautious, brave and strategic, and strive to gain broad social sympathy, among other things. Later, Chairman Mao came to Anshan several times at critical moments. The victory of the Anshan strike was achieved under Chairman Mao's personal leadership. However, the film "Sparking the Prairie Fire," under the pretext of allowing "artistic license," claimed to "create a glorious image of the Party" and attributed Chairman Mao's great achievements in pioneering the red land of Anshan to Lei Huanjue in the film, who is the capitalist-roader in power within the Party in real life.

To cater to the political needs of the capitalist-roader in power within the Party's counter-revolutionary restoration, and to fully beautify the capitalist-roader in power within the Party's evil purposes, the script underwent multiple revisions, even cutting scenes that had already been filmed. What scenes were cut and what content was emphasized?

The initial literary script did not dare to blatantly attribute Chairman Mao's great achievements to the capitalist-roader in power within the Party. In more obvious places, it still had to mention Chairman Mao. For example, in the first chapter of the 1960 draft, it describes Lei Huanjue's arrival in Anshan and his conversation with Old Yi:

	Old Yi introduced: "Old Geng, a teacher from Changsha, Mr. Mao, has come to set up a school."
	"Which Mr. Mao?" Old Geng asked.
	"Yes, yes, he went down into the mine."
	Old Yi reminded him.
	"Yes, you said we coal miners are destined to suffer, he said we need to find a way, I asked what way, they can crush us with a squeeze, he said a pebble can be kicked away with a foot, a big rock, you can't kick it over, you can't move it, workers need to unite, right?"
	"You have a good memory." Old Yi smiled.

	Again, in Chapter 6, it writes about Lei Huanjue preparing to negotiate with the mine bureau: Lei Huanjue took out a wallet, checked the contents, and solemnly handed a photo of Chairman Mao in his youth to Mangzi: "Keep this photo of Comrade Mao Runzhi well, he is our mainstay."

However, the revisionist Xia Yan would not allow Chairman Mao to be mentioned in the film. He falsely claimed that the early thoughts of Chairman Mao were all present in the capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Another revisionist also boasted: "We don't have to transfer Chairman Mao's deeds as they are." They wielded their axes, cutting out all mentions of Chairman Mao from the literary script, even deleting the scene where Lei Huanjue writes to Chairman Mao to report on work and Chairman Mao's reply. Instead, they emphasized Lei Huanjue's supposed courage. Their intentions are truly malicious!

The film, in order to beautify the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, did not hesitate to turn black into white and confuse right and wrong, using all kinds of despicable means.

Before the major strike, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that this strike must be carried through to the end. However, as soon as the strike began, the capitalist-roader in power within the Party eagerly wrote a letter to the capitalists of the mining and railway bureaus, requesting negotiations: "Please immediately send official representatives introduced by the Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the club representative ××× (referring to the capitalist-roader in power within the Party)." According to the recollections of old workers: the capitalist-roader in power within the Party was then protected by thousands of workers, both in front and behind, as he went to negotiate with the capitalists. Facing the capitalists' bayonet formation, the capitalist-roader in power within the Party was frightened and repeatedly declared: "I have no grudge against them (referring to the capitalists), I am a representative sent by everyone to mediate." At this critical juncture between the proletariat and the capitalists, the capitalist-roader in power within the Party was not representing the workers to fight against the capitalists but was mediating between the proletariat and the capitalists. In fact, this so-called negotiation was actually a big sellout, betraying the fundamental interests of the proletariat and making the capitalists' exploitation and oppression of the workers more legal. The poisonous weed "Sparking the Prairie Fire" deceived the audience; the film did not show any content of the negotiations but emphasized how the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, with "courage in his heart," single-handedly entered the den of the tiger, using verbal sparring to obtain the conditions for a truce, achieving the so-called "victory." This is a blatant lie and extremely shameless!

The major strike personally ignited by Chairman Mao was a display of the proletariat's fighting strength. Negotiations were not the goal of the strike but a means. The proletariat needs to overthrow the capitalists and become the masters of the state. This time, the capitalists were able to sit down for negotiations completely because the workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, united and fought, creating an overwhelming force that compelled the capitalists to sit down for negotiations. The film, however, turned everything upside down, making people think that "negotiations" were the ultimate goal of the strike's victory, and that Lei Huanjue was the sole "hero" of the strike's victory. This not only beautified the capitalist-roader in power within the Party but also advocated the line of class capitulation.

In the 1960 literary script, there was such a description: the crowd brought a sedan chair for Lei Huanjue to sit in, but Lei did not sit, and Mangzi whispered: "It's not you they are carrying, it's our Party." Later, they felt it was too obvious and changed it to workers surrounding Lei Huanjue, each with a heart full of gratitude, looking at this traitor who sold out the interests of the proletariat and was obsessed with "secret negotiations" with the capitalists. This change was only a superficial one, but the actual content remained the same.

"Your names and reputations will be torn apart, but the rivers will flow forever." The wheels of history roll on, and anyone who tries to distort history will inevitably be punished by history. Today, tens of millions of revolutionary proletarians, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have launched a general offensive against the capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The heinous crimes committed by the capitalist-roader in power within the Party in Anshan must be thoroughly settled. Let the red land of Anshan, personally pioneered by Chairman Mao, shine forever!

    《燎原》篡改历史的罪责难逃
    首都红代会中国人民大学“三红”文艺轻骑兵
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派企图篡党、篡军、篡政的野心由来已久。他通过各种场合，利用各种舆论工具来为自己的野心服务。他恬不知耻地指示作家要多写矿工斗争的文艺作品，实际就是让人歌颂他自己。主令仆从，大小娄罗闻风而动，为党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派歌功颂德的作品相继出笼了。在反动影片《燎原》出笼前，也就是一九六一年，由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂首先炮制出一部纪录电影《安源煤矿光辉的一页》。那部纪录片通过一组组的画面和解说词，把这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派吹捧为安源工人的救世主，说什么他“担当了俱乐部一万三千多路矿工人的总代表，坚定地走上大楼，跟资本家进行面对面的斗争”，什么由党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派“亲手培植过的两棵梧桐，现在已绿树成荫”等等。接着一九六三年就抛出了为党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派树碑立传的反动的故事片《燎原》。这部影片完全篡改了安源工人在毛主席亲自领导下英勇斗争的历史，把我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的不朽功绩，完全加到这个假革命、反革命的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派身上。影片企图通过盗名窃誉、篡改历史的伎俩，为这个赫鲁晓夫式的大阴谋家篡党篡国作舆论准备。
    安源煤矿是个有着光荣革命传统的红色煤矿。这块红色的土地是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自开拓的。一九二一年冬天，我们伟大领袖毛主席来到了安源，到井下跟矿工们交知心朋友，宣传革命道理，在安源播下了革命种子。毛主席回到长沙后，即派党的干部来安源，开展工人运动。毛主席指示他们：要在那里站住脚，要取得合法地位，可以先在那里办一个补习学校。于是，一九二二年五月，工人们成立了自己的战斗组织——安源路矿工人俱乐部。在中国共产党的领导下，从一九二一年底到一九二二年，掀起了一个全国性的工人罢工高潮。这个时候，安源工人俱乐部在毛主席思想的滋润下，成长很快，仅仅两个月的时间，俱乐部成员已经发展到七百多名。俱乐部日益壮大的声势，吓坏了资本家。他们用金钱收买，用死亡威胁，最后甚至报请伪萍乡县下令封闭俱乐部，妄图扼杀刚刚起来的工人运动。在这紧要关头，毛主席于一九二二年九月八日第二次来到安源。
    毛主席到安源，进一步了解和研究了安源的情况以后，认为大罢工的条件已经成熟，果断地定下了罢工的决策。毛主席还教导大家：在对敌斗争中要胆大心细，有勇有谋，并且要争取广泛的社会同情等等。以后，毛主席在关键时刻又曾几次来安源。安源罢工的胜利，是在毛主席的亲自领导下取得的。然而，影片《燎原》在所谓允许“艺术虚构”的幌子下，借口什么“塑造党的光辉形象”，把毛主席开拓安源这块红色的土地的伟大功绩，完全算到影片中的雷焕觉，现实生活中党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的头上。
    为了迎合党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派反革命复辟的政治需要，为了达到彻底美化党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的罪恶目的，剧本曾作了多次的删改，甚至对已经拍成了片子的情节也大加删剪。删改的都是些什么情节，极力渲染的又是些什么内容呢？
    最初的文学剧本中还不敢明目张胆地把毛主席的伟大功绩算在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派头上。在比较明显的地方还不得不提到毛主席。例如一九六○年稿的第一章，描写雷焕觉刚来安源到易老倌家中有这样的对话：
        易老倌介绍：“老耿，长沙毛先生派人来办学堂了。”
        “是那个，毛润芝先生吧？”老耿问。
        “对，对，下井去看过。”
        易老倌提醒他。
        “对，你说我们炭估佬命里注定受苦，他说要想办法，我问
        想什么办法，人家一捏就捏扁了，他说一颗石子一脚就踢飞
        了，一块大石头，你踢不倒，搬不动，工人要团结，是这样
         说的吧？”
        “你记性真好。”老倌子笑了。
    又如第六章写雷焕觉准备和矿局去谈判：雷焕觉掏出一个皮夹子，检查了里面的东西，把一张毛主席青年时代的照片慎重地交给猛子：“这张毛润芝同志的照片好好保存，他是我们的主心骨。”
    但是修正主义分子夏衍就是不让在影片中提到毛主席。他胡说什么毛主席早期的思想，在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派身上都是有的。另一个修正主义分子也扬言：“不一定把毛主席的事迹原本搬上。”他们挥起板斧，把文学剧本中提到毛主席的有关情节全部砍掉，甚至连雷焕觉给毛主席写信汇报工作及毛主席回信的情节也全都删掉，相反尽量突出雷焕觉的所谓胆识。他们的用心何其毒也！
    影片为了美化党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不惜颠倒黑白，混淆是非，使尽了各种卑劣的手段。
    毛主席在大罢工的前夕曾明确指出，这次大罢工一定要坚持到底。然而大罢工刚一开始，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派就迫不及待地写信给路矿两局的资本家，要求和谈：“请即派遣正式代表由商会介绍与俱乐部代表×××（指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派）接洽。”据老工人回忆：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，当时是千百万工人前护后拥地保护着他去和资本家谈判的。面对资本家摆下的枪刺行列，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派心惊肉跳，一再表白自己：“我跟他们（指资本家）没有仇，我是大家派的代表去调解的。”在这工人阶级和资本家两个阶级生死搏斗的严重关头，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派根本不是代表工人去和资本家斗争的，而是去调和工人阶级和资本家两个阶级的斗争的。事实上，这次所谓的谈判，实际上就是一次大拍卖，出卖了无产阶级的根本利益，使资本家剥削压榨工人更加合法化。大毒草《燎原》欺骗了观众，影片没有显示一点谈判的内容，而极力渲染的是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派如何“一身是胆”，只身入虎穴，用唇枪舌剑换得了和谈的条件，取得了所谓的“胜利”，真是漫天撒谎，无耻之极！
    毛主席亲自点燃的这次大罢工，是一次工人阶级战斗力的检阅，谈判不是罢工的目的，而是一种手段。工人阶级需要的是推翻资本家而作国家的主人。这次安源工人大罢工，资本家之所以能坐下来谈判，完全是工人遵照毛主席的教导，团结战斗，造成了泰山压顶之势，迫使资本家坐下来谈判。影片却把这一切完全颠倒了，使人们觉得“和谈”是代表胜利的最终目的，雷焕觉是罢工胜利的独胆“英雄”。这既美化了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，又宣扬了阶级投降主义路线。
    在一九六○年的文学剧本中，有这样的描写：群众抬来一顶轿子，要雷焕觉坐，雷不坐，猛子小声说：“不是抬你，是抬我们的党。”后来，他们觉得太露骨了，才改作工人簇拥在雷焕觉周围，每个人带着万分感激的心情来看这个出卖工人阶级利益，醉心于和资本家“密日和谈”的大工贼。这样改，只是形式上换了个样，而实际内容还是一样的。
    “尔曹身与名俱裂，不废江河万古流。”历史的车轮滚滚向前，谁要想篡改历史，必然要遭到历史的惩罚。今天，亿万无产阶级革命派在毛主席的领导下，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动了总攻击，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在安源犯下的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算。让毛主席亲自开拓的安源这块红色土地永放光彩！
