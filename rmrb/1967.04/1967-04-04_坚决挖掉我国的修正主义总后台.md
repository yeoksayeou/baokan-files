The great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which exposed a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party and the top capitalist-roaders within the Party who supported them from behind the scenes. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. We, the working class, cheer loudly and applaud enthusiastically!

In the seventeen years since liberation, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, along with his henchmen, have been busy everywhere carrying out activities to restore capitalism. Our Taiyuan Textile Mill was also one of their strongholds for this restoration. In the eight years since our mill was established, it was supposedly a socialist enterprise, but in reality, it was a testing ground for revisionism. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the province and the mill opposed us in running the enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought and frantically pushed their capitalist goods. They used cumbersome systems to shackle the workers and used material incentives to corrupt them. Anyone who opposed them was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" or "anti-Party element." I myself was subjected to their discrimination and persecution.

The Party and the people bestowed upon me the honorable titles of an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and an advanced producer in the textile system, but they were very displeased. They never allowed me to report to the workers the advanced experiences of other units in studying Chairman Mao's works and opposed my technical innovations to expand the looms and spindles. Whenever I raised any suggestions, they would tell me to study "Cultivation of the Self"; when I didn't listen to their nonsense, they hated me to the core. During the Four Clean-ups movement, they brought out the "left" in form, right in essence experiences from the "Peach Garden" to persecute me and many revolutionary workers in every possible way. In this Cultural Revolution, they viciously attacked and struck at us revolutionaries on the left.

However, we workers love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to resolutely fight against this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. This time, we finally knocked them down and seized all the power they had usurped.

For a long time, we have suspected that this handful of bad guys dared to wreak havoc in socialist New China, and there must be some ghost behind them. But we didn't know where this ghost was. In this Cultural Revolution, we took up the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought and finally saw clearly that this ghost was no small matter. It turned out to be the top capitalist-roader within the Party, the one who shouted about how "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it" and "capitalists also serve the people"!

You, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, are truly shameless. How can you be called an old revolutionary? You are a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary, you are China's Khrushchev. Let me tell you, you "old revolutionary," you can no longer deceive people today. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, will definitely rebel against you, seize your power, pull you down from your horse, sweep away your prestige, and resolutely uproot you, this chief backer of revisionism.

    坚决挖掉我国的修正主义总后台
    太原纺织厂学习毛主席著作积极分子、纺织系统先进生产者  解悦
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，挖出了党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子和在背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们工人阶级千声叫好，拍手称快！
    解放十七年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，指使和支持他的喽罗们到处进行资本主义复辟活动。我们太原纺织厂也是他们搞复辟的一个据点。我们厂建立八年来，名为社会主义企业，实际上是个修正主义试验场。省里和厂里的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，反对我们按照毛泽东思想办企业，疯狂地推行他们那一套资本主义货色。他们用繁琐的制度束缚工人，用物质刺激腐蚀工人。谁要是反对他们，就把谁打成“反党分子”、“反革命分子”。我自己就受到他们的歧视和迫害。
    党和人民授予我以学习毛主席著作积极分子和先进生产者的光荣称号，他们很不满意，一直不许我向工人汇报兄弟单位学习毛主席著作的先进经验，反对我进行扩台扩锭的技术革新。我一提意见，他们就要我学《修养》；我不听那一套，他们就对我恨之入骨。在四清运动中，他们搬出后台老板的那套形“左”实右的桃园经验，千方百计迫害我和许多革命职工。在这次文化大革命中，他们又恶毒地围攻、打击我们革命左派。
    可是，我们工人阶级，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。我们用毛泽东思想为武器，同他们这一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行了坚决的斗争。这一次终于把他们打翻在地，夺了他们窃踞的一切大权。
    很久以来，我们就怀疑这一小撮坏家伙胆敢在社会主义新中国胡作非为，背后一定有鬼。但是不知道这个鬼在那里。在这次文化大革命中，我们拿起毛泽东思想这个照妖镜，才看清楚这个鬼的来头不小，原来就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是大叫什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”和“资本家也是为人民服务”的“老革命”！
    你这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，真是太不知耻了。你哪能算老革命，你是一个道道地地的假革命、反革命，你是中国的赫鲁晓夫。老实告诉你，你这个“老革命”，今天不能再招摇撞骗了。我们无产阶级革命派一定要造你的反，夺你的权，把你拉下马来，扫尽你的威风体面，坚决挖掉你这个修正主义总后台。
