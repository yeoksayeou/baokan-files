In the great leader Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have, through arduous efforts, planted trees covering over 30,000 mu this spring, surpassing any previous year. The quality of the afforestation is also excellent.

Over the years, people from all over the country have sent numerous precious saplings to Shaoshan to help with greening efforts. Many international friends who have traveled thousands of miles to Shaoshan have also planted countless friendship trees here. Building and greening Shaoshan is the shared aspiration of the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the world. During the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with boundless love for Chairman Mao's hometown, have been racing against time to undertake large-scale greening efforts in Shaoshan. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hetang People's Commune have planted over 1,170,000 trees, exceeding the original plan by 80%.

This round of greening Shaoshan has received even greater support from revolutionary people in various places compared to previous years. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and urban residents from various places have regarded greening Chairman Mao's hometown as the most meaningful labor.

    韶山植树造林三万多亩
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的家乡韶山，广大贫下中农和革命干部经过积极努力，今春造林三万多亩，超过了以往任何一年。造林的质量也很好。
    历年来，全国人民为绿化韶山，从各地送来了许多珍贵的树苗。不远万里来到韶山的许多国际友人，也在这里亲手种下了无数棵友谊树。建设韶山，绿化韶山，是全国人民、全世界革命人民的共同心愿。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的贫下中农和革命干部，怀着无限热爱毛主席家乡的心情，争分抢秒地大规模地绿化韶山。荷塘公社广大贫下中农和革命干部一举植树一百一十七万多株，超额完成原计划的百分之八十。
    这次绿化韶山，得到了各地革命人民比往年更大的支持。各地革命职工、贫下中农、革命师生和城镇居民，把绿化毛主席家乡当作最有意义的劳动。
