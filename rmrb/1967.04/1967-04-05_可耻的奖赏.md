In the Soviet Union today, under the rule of the revisionist clique, anti-China activities can be rewarded.

Recently, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued an order to "commend" a group of anti-China thugs from the Soviet Embassy in China and other institutions, awarding them with the "Labor Red Banner" and "Honor" medals, as well as the "Labor Valor" and "Labor Excellence" medals. Among the recipients are: the Soviet Embassy secretary who was expelled from China for defaming and insulting Chinese workers without reason, and the notorious head of the TASS News Agency's Beijing bureau, who is infamous for spreading rumors, among others.

It is said that these individuals received their awards because they demonstrated "courage and steadfastness." However, what kind of "courage" and "steadfastness" is this? This is "courage" shown in the disgraceful anti-China activities, and this is the "steadfastness" of counter-revolutionaries. According to such standards, the medals should first be given to the Soviet revisionist leaders like Brezhnev and Kosygin. Extending this logic, shouldn't medals also be given to the head of American imperialism, Johnson, and other reactionaries around the world?

It is not surprising that such things are happening in the Soviet Union today. The Soviet revisionist leadership has long betrayed Lenin, betrayed socialism, and betrayed the Soviet and world peoples, achieving a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. Therefore, under their rule, the Soviet Union must be a place where revolution is a crime, and there are injustices throughout the country; where counter-revolution is rewarded, and traitors celebrate. Since the great traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin have one by one worn the "Lenin Medal," it is only natural that their subordinates who have performed anti-China deeds receive a "Labor Red Banner" medal or an "Honor" medal.

However, this desperate move to award medals reveals a fact: anti-China sentiment in the Soviet Union is extremely unpopular. Precisely because of this, the Soviet revisionist leadership resorts to such tactics, attempting to use "heavy rewards" to lure and incite anti-China sentiment. But their despicable actions can only provoke contempt and indignation from the Soviet people and people around the world.

### 可耻的奖赏

    可耻的奖赏
    在修正主义集团统治下的今日之苏联，反华居然可以论功行赏。
    最近，苏联最高苏维埃主席团下了一道命令，决定“褒奖”苏联驻中国大使馆和其他机构的一批反华的打手，分别授给他们以“劳动红旗”和“荣誉”勋章以及“劳动英勇”和“劳动出色”奖章。得奖的人包括：由于无理诽谤和侮辱中国职工而被中国驱逐出境的苏联使馆秘书，由于专门造谣而臭名昭彰的塔斯社驻北京分社社长，等等。
    据说，这些人所以获得奖赏，是因为他们“表现出勇敢、坚毅精神”。然而，这是什么“勇敢”，什么“坚毅”呢？这是在可耻的反华活动中表现出的“勇敢”，这是反革命的“坚毅”。按照这样的标准，勋章首先应当发给勃列日?夫、柯西金等苏修头目们自己。推而广之，岂不是也该发给美帝国主义的头子约翰逊之流以及各国反动派吗？
    在今日的苏联发生了这种事情，是毫不奇怪的。苏修领导集团早已背叛了列宁，背叛了社会主义，背叛了苏联人民和世界人民，实现了资本主义反革命复辟。那末，在他们统治下的苏联，必然是：革命有罪，冤狱遍于国中；反革命有赏，叛徒弹冠相庆。既然大叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日?夫、柯西金之流一个一个地把“列宁勋章”戴上襟头，反华有功的大小娄罗弄上个把“劳动红旗”勋章或者“荣誉”勋章，岂不是十分正常的吗？
    但是，这种穷极无聊的授勋，却说明了一个事实：反华在苏联是极不得人心的。正是因为这样，所以苏修领导集团不惜出此下策，企图以“重赏”来招降纳叛，煽动反华。但是，他们的这种卑劣的行径，只能引起苏联人民和全世界人民的鄙视和愤慨。
