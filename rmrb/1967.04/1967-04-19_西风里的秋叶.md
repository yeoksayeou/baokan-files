	As revolutionary forces around the world continue to grow and strengthen, and the imperialist bloc faces disintegration and mounting difficulties, the U.S. imperialists are now confronted with a new economic crisis.

	Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1947, "The economic strength of U.S. imperialism, which was enhanced during the Second World War, is facing an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. The further shrinkage of this market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis. The war boom in the United States is merely a temporary phenomenon. Its strength is only superficial and temporary."

	Facts have fully proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis. Since the end of the Second World War, despite the fact that the United States has "rampaged like a wild beast through Europe and Asia and other places," it has still experienced four economic crises. In recent years, the U.S. ruling class has relied on gradually escalating the Vietnam War, significantly increasing military orders, and using so-called "aid" to strengthen economic infiltration in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Domestically, they have intensified the exploitation of the American people, expanded public and private credit, and created a false "prosperity," temporarily delaying the outbreak of the economic crisis.

	However, all of this is merely a case of stopping a poisonous snake by cutting off its tail. The bottomless pit of war expenses in Vietnam further weakens the U.S. ruling class's ability to delay the economic crisis. This makes a new economic crisis inevitable and increasingly imminent. The paper tiger of U.S. imperialism is more exposed than ever.

	At the same time, the situation in the major capitalist countries of Western Europe is also far from rosy. Once the U.S. economic crisis erupts, it will inevitably trigger a chain reaction in Western Europe and the entire capitalist world. The increasingly decaying capitalist system is like an autumn leaf trembling in the west wind, facing its own doom.

	U.S. imperialism is making desperate struggles both domestically and internationally to alleviate the economic crisis. However, no matter how it struggles, the result will only be the further awakening of the American people and the further development of the world revolution, while U.S. imperialism will move closer to its demise.

	"The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting stronger day by day." The international situation is developing according to the general trend pointed out by Chairman Mao, and it will continue to develop in this way until the complete annihilation of U.S. imperialism and all other harmful elements.

    西风里的秋叶
    正当全世界革命力量日益发展壮大，帝国主义集团分崩离析、困难重重的时候，美帝国主义面临了一场新的经济危机。
    毛主席早在一九四七年就指出，“美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场和国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的和暂时的。”
    事实完全证明了毛主席的这个英明的论断。从二次大战以来，美国尽管“象野兽一样，向欧亚两洲和其他地方乱窜”，仍然先后爆发了四次经济危机。近年来，美国统治集团依靠逐步扩大侵越战争，大量增加军事定货，同时对外通过所谓“援助”等手段加强对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的经济渗透，对内加紧剥削美国人民，扩大公私信贷，制造虚假的“繁荣”，暂时延缓了经济危机的爆发。
    但是，这一切都不过是饮鸩止渴。侵越战争费用的无底洞，进一步削弱了美国统治集团延缓经济危机的能力。这就使得一场新的经济危机不可避免地日益迫近。美帝国主义这只纸老虎更加原形毕露了。
    与此同时，西欧主要资本主义国家的情况也并不美妙。美国经济危机一旦爆发，必将在西欧和整个资本主义世界引起连锁反应。日益腐朽的资本主义制度，正如战栗在西风里的一片秋叶一样，面临着自己的末日。
    美帝国主义正在国内外作疯狂的挣扎，以图缓和经济危机。但是，不管它怎样挣扎，结果只能是美国人民的进一步觉醒和世界革命的更加发展，而美帝国主义则将更加接近死亡。
    “敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。”国际形势正在照毛主席所指出的这个总的特点发展，并且将这样发展下去，直到美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫的彻底灭亡。
