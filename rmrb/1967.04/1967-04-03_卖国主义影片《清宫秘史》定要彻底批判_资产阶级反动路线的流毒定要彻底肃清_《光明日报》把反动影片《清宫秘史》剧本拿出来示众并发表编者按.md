The traitorous film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" must be thoroughly criticized.
The poison of the bourgeois reactionary line must be thoroughly purged.
"Guangming Daily" exposes the script of the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" and publishes an editorial note.

Xinhua News Agency, April 2: To provide materials for revolutionary masses to analyze and criticize, "Guangming Daily" today publishes the script of the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty," and at the same time publishes an editorial note.

The full text of the "Guangming Daily" editorial note is as follows:

The fifth issue of "Red Flag" magazine published an important article by Comrade Chen Boda, "Patriotism or Treachery?", which provided a profound criticism of the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" and its promoters.

"The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is a so-called historical film that was screened in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places in 1950. The film openly stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and the reactionary bourgeoisie, arbitrarily distorting historical facts, glorifying imperialism, feudalism, and bourgeois reformism, praising the monarchist party, and defaming the people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. It propagates nationalism and class surrenderism.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out that "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is a traitorous film and must be criticized. However, such a traitorous film has been praised by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party as a "patriotic" film. Anti-revolutionary revisionists such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Hu Qiaomu, following his instructions, stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary stance, openly opposing Chairman Mao, and have consistently refused to criticize this poisonous weed.

The diametrically opposed evaluations and attitudes towards "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" are not merely different views on a specific film. It is the first confrontation between the proletarian revolutionary faction led by Chairman Mao and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party on the cultural and ideological front. The struggle surrounding the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and bourgeois reformism, revisionism, a struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration. Ultimately, it is a struggle between capitalism and socialism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Errors must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be fought against. Now, we publish the script of "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" for revolutionary masses to analyze and criticize.

The thoroughly reactionary and traitorous film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" must be thoroughly criticized by the revolutionary masses in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those who oppose Chairman Mao's instructions, including a handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party who supports them, must also be thoroughly criticized by the revolutionary masses. We hope that all revolutionary masses will raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, bravely join the battle, thoroughly criticize and purge the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in all aspects; smash the old ideology of the exploiting class, establish Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》定要彻底批判
    资产阶级反动路线的流毒定要彻底肃清
    《光明日报》把反动影片《清宫秘史》剧本拿出来示众并发表编者按
    新华社二日讯　为供革命群众进行分析批判，《光明日报》今天刊登了反动影片《清宫秘史》的电影剧本，同时发表了编者按语。
    《光明日报》编者按全文如下：
    《红旗》杂志第五期发表了戚本禹同志的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》，对反动影片《清宫秘史》及其吹捧者进行了深刻的批判。
    《清宫秘史》是一部所谓历史题材的影片，曾于一九五○年在北京、上海等地放映。影片公开站在帝国主义、封建主义和反动资产阶级立场上，任意歪曲历史事实，美化帝国主义，美化封建主义和资产阶级改良主义，歌颂保皇党，污蔑群众运动和人民反帝反封建的英勇斗争，宣扬民族投降主义和阶级投降主义。
    毛主席早就严正指出：《清宫秘史》是一部卖国主义的影片，应该进行批判。可是，这样一部卖国主义影片，却被党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派吹捧为“爱国主义”的影片，而反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬和胡××等，秉承他的意旨，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，公然和毛主席唱对台戏，一直拒绝对这株毒草进行批判。
    对《清宫秘史》的截然相反的评价和态度，决不仅仅是对一部具体影片的看法的不同。它是以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文化思想战线上第一次短兵相接的交锋。围绕《清宫秘史》这部反动影片的斗争，是资产阶级同无产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同资产阶级改良主义、修正主义思想的斗争，是资本主义复辟同无产阶级反复辟的斗争。归根结底，是资本主义同社会主义谁战胜谁的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。现在，我们把《清宫秘史》的电影剧本刊登出来，供革命群众进行分析批判。
    反动的、彻底的卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》，一定要在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中受到革命群众的彻底批判。对抗毛主席指示的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以及背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，也一定要在运动中受到革命群众的彻底批判。我们希望广大革命群众，高举革命的批判旗帜，勇敢地投入战斗，彻底批判和肃清以党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒；大破剥削阶级的旧思想，大立毛泽东思想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
