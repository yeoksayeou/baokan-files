	The farmers in the liberated areas of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, overcame natural disasters and difficulties caused by enemy sabotage in 1966. They actively developed production and achieved a good harvest.

	Despite many provinces in the Southwestern Region suffering from floods last year, the local farmers' hard work expanded the rice planting area to 790,000 hectares. In particular, the rice planting area in Tien Giang Province increased by 14% compared to 1965.

	While vigorously developing rice production, the farmers in the Southwestern Region also made efforts to expand the planting of cassava, sweet potatoes, and legumes. In Tien Giang Province alone, the planting area of these crops increased by 3,000 hectares compared to 1965. Additionally, livestock, fishing, and salt production in this region also saw development. The total number of cattle in provinces like Soc Trang, Tra Vinh, Dinh Tuong, and Tien Giang increased by 36,000 compared to 1965, and the number of pigs increased by 222,000. Soc Trang Province's salt production reached 42,800 tons in 1966.

	The provinces in the South Central Region also saw significant agricultural development in 1966 compared to 1965.

	Last year, the people in the liberated areas of Ninh Thuan Province planted 700,000 more cassava trees compared to 1965. Some places also planted early-ripening rice, ensuring self-sufficiency and reserving grain for 1967. The mountain people in Ninh Thuan Province planted three times the amount of cassava compared to 1965. The rice planting area in the plains of Binh Thuan Province increased by 20% compared to 1965.

	In the Tam Ky region, the early rice planting area also doubled compared to 1965.

    战胜自然灾害，克服敌人破坏造成的困难
    解放区农业生产去年取得好收成
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放区农民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，一九六六年战胜了自然灾害和敌人破坏所造成的困难，积极发展生产，取得了好收成。
    南部西区去年尽管有许多省遭到水涝灾害，但由于当地农民的艰苦奋斗，水稻种植面积仍然扩大到七十九万公顷，其中茶荣省的水稻种植面积比一九六五年增加了百分之十四。
    南部西区的农民在大力发展水稻生产的同时，还努力扩种番薯、木薯和豆类等杂粮作物。仅茶荣省杂粮作物的种植面积就比一九六五年增加三千公顷。此外，这个地区的牧、渔、盐等副业生产也有了发展。芹苴、朔庄、迪石、茶荣等省的耕牛总数比一九六五年增加三万六千头，猪增加二十二万二千头。朔庄省去年的产盐量达到四万二千八百吨。
    中部南区各省，去年农业生产也比一九六五年大大发展。
    去年，林同省解放区人民比一九六五年多种了七十万棵木薯。有些地方还增种了早熟稻，除做到自给外，还为一九六七年留下了贮备粮。宁顺省山区人民种植的木薯相当于一九六五年的三倍。平顺省平原地区三月稻种植面积比一九六五年增加百分之二十。
    在同塔梅地区，去年早稻播种面积也比一九六五年增加两倍。
