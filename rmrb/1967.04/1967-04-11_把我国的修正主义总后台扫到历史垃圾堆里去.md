	*Editor's Note from the People's Liberation Army Daily:*

	The top capitalist-roader in power within the Party brazenly advocates the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "rebellion is unjust," directly opposing Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "revolution is not a crime" and "rebellion is justified." This has aroused the utmost indignation among the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. They have expressed their strong feelings, exposing and criticizing the reactionary fallacies of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

	What kind of vine produces what kind of grapes, what kind of class speaks what kind of words. The top capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates "exploitation is meritorious" and "rebellion is unjust," acting as an apologist for the exploiting class's exploitation of the laboring people, singing praises for the exploitative system of man eating man, and clearing the way for capitalism.

	The top capitalist-roader in power within the Party shamelessly says: "The more one exploits, the greater the merit." This is sheer nonsense. The "merit" of the exploiting class is the "merit" of eating people, the "merit" of killing people without batting an eye, the "merit" of creating the bloody history of our proletariat and laboring people.

	Not understanding what class is and what exploitation is means not understanding revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers suffered deeply from exploitation in the old society. They have grasped Mao Zedong Thought and thus best understand what class and exploitation are, and they are the most eager to make revolution. They see through the reactionary fallacies of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party the clearest, hate them the deepest, and criticize them the most thoroughly. The authors of the articles published today use Chairman Mao's viewpoint on class and class struggle as a weapon to dissect the ugly soul of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party, exposing his conspiracy to restore capitalism in broad daylight.

	Currently, the criticism of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party is a mass movement to uproot the chief backer of revisionism in our country, prevent the restoration of capitalism, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. Every comrade must hold high the great banner of criticizing the revolution with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party. We must strive our utmost to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	*Soldier, Yan Wenyuan, of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army*

	The article "Patriotism or Treason?" is excellent! It expresses what we want to say.

	In January of this year, I received a letter from someone surnamed Li. The letter said: "Dear little brother, I am your long-lost second sister!" ... I read this letter, tears streaming down my face, my heart filled with deep emotion, and the past unfolded before my eyes.

	From the time I could remember, my mother often pulled me to her side, tears in her eyes, and said, "Before you, there was an older sister. In that old society of man-eating, we couldn't live, so I sold your one-and-a-half-year-old sister for fifty pounds of sweet potatoes ..."

	Why was this?! Because the ruling class of the old society said oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, and rebellion is unjust. We poor people hated the old society to the core, hated the landlords, capitalists, and the exploiting class with a deep, unyielding hatred.

	However, the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party, who wears the label of an "old revolutionary," says: "Today, capitalist exploitation is not only not a sin but also a merit," "the laboring people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it," "if there are more capitalists and more exploitation, then we will feel more comfortable." This is purely the reactionary nonsense of the exploiting class, fully exposing the ugly face of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party. This shows that he loves the exploiting class, loves capitalism; he hates the laboring people, hates socialism and communism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." This top capitalist-roader in power within the Party is not an "old revolutionary" at all but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary through and through.

	We will not pity such a snake-like evil person. Pitying such an evil person would cause our society to regress, and we would suffer twice. We must fight and expose the top capitalist-roader in power within the Party, sending him to the dustbin of history to "reflect"!

    《解放军报》编者按：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，明目张胆地鼓吹“剥削有功”、“造反无理”的谬论，和毛主席的“革命无罪”、“造反有理”的光辉思想相对抗，引起了广大干部战士的无比愤慨。他们以切身体会，痛斥了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的这种反动谬论。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，鼓吹“剥削有功”、“造反无理”，是为剥削阶级剥削劳动人民充当辩护士，是为人吃人的剥削制度唱赞歌，是为资本主义鸣锣开道。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，恬不知耻地说：
  “剥削得越多，功劳越大。”这纯粹是胡说八道。剥削阶级的“功劳”，就是吃人的“功劳”，就是杀人不眨眼的
  “功劳”，就是制造我们无产阶级和劳动人民血泪史的
  “功劳”。
    不懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。广大工农兵群众，在旧社会深受剥削之苦，他们掌握了毛泽东思想，就最懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削，就最要革命，他们对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反动谬论就看得最清，恨得最深，批得最透。今天发表的这组稿件的作者，用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争的观点作武器，去解剖党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶灵魂，把他那复辟资本主义的阴谋，暴露在光天化日之下。
    当前，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派展开的批判，是一场挖掉我国的修正主义总后台，防止资本主义复辟，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的革命群众运动。我们每个同志都要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判的大旗，彻底地把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透。我们要为保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线尽最大努力，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！

    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇文章好极了！它说出了我们心里要说的话。
    今年一月，我接到一位姓李的人寄来的信。信上说：“亲爱的弟弟，我就是你丢失多年的二姐！……”我读了这封信，热泪滚滚，心情万分激动，幕幕往事又展现在眼前。
    从我记事时起，母亲经常把我拉在身旁，含着眼泪对我说：“在你前头还有个二姐。在那吃人的旧社会里，一家人无法生活，我把你一岁半的二姐卖了，换了五十斤红苕。……”
    这是为什么？！因为旧社会统治阶级说是压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。我们穷苦人，恨透了旧社会，恨死了地主、资本家，和剥削阶级有不共戴天的深仇大恨。
    然而挂着“老革命”招牌的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却说什么：“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”，“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“如果资本家多了，剥削多了，那么，我们就越感到舒服”。这完全是剥削阶级的反动谰言，充分暴露了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派丑恶的嘴脸。这说明他爱的是剥削阶级，爱的是资本主义；他恨的是劳动人民，恨的是社会主义、共产主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派原来不是什么“老革命”，而是地地道道的假革命、反革命。
    我们决不会怜惜蛇一样的恶人，怜惜这样的恶人，我们的社会就要倒退，我们就要重受二遍苦。我们一定要把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒斗臭，让他到历史的垃圾堆里去“修养”吧！
