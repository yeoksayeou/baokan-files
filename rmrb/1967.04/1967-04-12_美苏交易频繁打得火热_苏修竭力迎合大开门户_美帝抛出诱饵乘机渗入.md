The United States imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership, while intensifying their collusion to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and to jointly oppose China, are also engaged in frequent transactions on various big and small issues. The U.S. and Soviet revisionists are so hot on each other that the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership is even more exposed.

The "disarmament" issue is currently one of the major transactions between the U.S. and Soviet revisionists. Following the signing of the so-called "Treaty on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space," both sides are accelerating the drafting of a "Non-Proliferation Treaty" at the Geneva "Disarmament Conference" and have begun haggling over the so-called limitation of the development of offensive and defensive nuclear missiles. This is their dirty deal to maintain their remaining nuclear monopoly and to deal with the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

At the same time, the long-stalled U.S.-Soviet consular treaty and civil aviation agreement have finally been sealed. Johnson signed the consular treaty on March 31, completing the final approval procedure; the civil aviation agreement has entered the stage of negotiating technical details, and it is expected that direct flights between New York and Moscow will soon begin. U.S. politicians and newspapers have acknowledged that the signing of the consular treaty is a step taken by the U.S. to "improve" U.S.-Soviet relations and to encourage the Soviet revisionists to serve the U.S. further on the Vietnam issue.

With the tightening of political collusion between the U.S. and Soviet revisionists and the acceleration of the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, the U.S., under the guise of developing economic and trade relations between the two countries, has greatly strengthened its economic infiltration and enticement of the Soviet Union. Following the repeated easing of trade restrictions with the Soviet Union by the Johnson administration last year, it is now demanding that the U.S. Congress pass a bill to expand trade with the Soviet Union. At the same time, U.S. leaders and monopolists are constantly advocating the use of expanded trade and other means to promote the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union, believing that this will be beneficial to the U.S.'s "broad political purposes" and "economic interests"; while the Soviet revisionist leadership is also willing to take the bait. In January of this year, the Soviet foreign trade organization published an advertisement in the U.S. *New York Times*, actively soliciting U.S. investment. Subsequently, it was reported that the U.S. Export-Import Bank is preparing to provide funding for the equipment of an automobile factory in the Soviet Union.

As a gesture of "trust" and "friendship" towards the Soviet revisionists, in February of this year, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission announced that it had issued a permit for the export of a small amount of radioactive isotopes to the Soviet Union. In the same month, the two countries also signed two agreements on fishing in the U.S. West Coast.

Meanwhile, both sides are strengthening so-called cultural and scientific "exchanges." U.S. and Soviet representatives recently held several weeks of talks in Moscow on the "plan to promote U.S.-Soviet scientific exchanges." After the talks, the vice president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Kistiakowsky, said that the talks were "generally very satisfactory."

From March 26 to 29, the U.S. government, at the invitation of the Soviet revisionist authorities, held an exhibition in Moscow called "U.S. Industrial Aesthetics," extolling U.S. "material civilization" and "way of life." The Soviet revisionist authorities were very enthusiastic about this exhibition, providing eager assistance.

The Soviet reactionary poet Yevtushenko recently visited the U.S., shamelessly reading his revisionist black poetry on a U.S. television program and spouting extreme pro-U.S. and anti-China rhetoric. It is reported that the Soviet revisionists have also decided to send a performing arts troupe to the U.S. to participate in the "cultural festival" to be held in New York in June and July this year.

These facts show that under the "common goal" of opposing China, communism, the people, and revolution, the counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and Soviet revisionists has reached an extremely intimate level. However, the more they collude, the more they expose their evil plots of colluding with each other and opposing the revolutionary peoples of the world.

### 美苏交易频繁打得火热  苏修竭力迎合大开门户　美帝抛出诱饵乘机渗入

    美苏交易频繁打得火热
    苏修竭力迎合大开门户　美帝抛出诱饵乘机渗入
    新华社十日讯　美帝国主义和苏修领导集团在加紧勾结，共谋扼杀越南人民抗美救国斗争和联合反华的同时，正在其他若干大大小小的问题上，频繁地进行交易，美帝和苏修两家打得如此火热，使得苏修领导集团的叛徒嘴脸更加暴露无遗。
      “裁军”问题，是美帝和苏修间目前正在进行的一笔大交易。继签订所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”之后，双方正在日内瓦“裁军会议”上加速炮制一项“防止核扩散条约”，并且开始就所谓限制发展进攻性和防御性核导弹问题讨价还价。这是它们为了维持残存的核垄断地位，对付亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命斗争而进行的肮脏勾当。
    同时，搁置多年的美苏领事条约和民航协定，已经最后拍板成交。约翰逊在三月三十一日签署了领事条约，从而完成了最后一道批准手续；民航协定则已进入谈判技术细节阶段，预计，纽约、莫斯科之间不久即可正式通航。美国政客和报刊纷纷承认，领事条约的签订，是美帝为“改善”美苏关系和鼓励苏修在越南问题上进一步为美帝效劳而采取的一个步骤。
    随着美苏在政治上勾结的加紧和苏修国内资本主义复辟的加速，美国以发展两国经济和贸易关系为名，大大加强了对苏联的经济渗透和引诱。约翰逊政府继去年一再放宽对苏贸易限制之后，正在要求美国国会通过扩大对苏贸易的法案。同时，美帝头目和垄断资本家都不断鼓吹要利用扩大贸易等手段来促进苏联的“和平演变”，认为这会有利于美国的“广泛的政治目的”和“经济利益”；而苏修领导集团也心甘情愿地表示乐意上钩。今年一月，苏联对外贸易机构在美国《纽约时报》上刊登广告，大肆招揽美国投资。接着，就有消息说，美国进出口银行准备为给苏联装备一个汽车工厂提供资金。
    作为对苏修表示“信任”和“友好”的一个姿态，今年二月，美国原子能委员会宣布，它已经颁发了向苏联出口小量放射性同位素的许可。同月，两国还就在美国西海岸捕鱼问题签订了两个协定。
    与此同时，双方在加强所谓文化科学的“交流”。美苏代表最近在莫斯科就“增进美苏科学交流”的计划进行了数周的会谈。会后，美国全国科学院副院长基斯提亚科夫斯基表示，会谈“总的说来是很令人满意的”。
    三月二十六日到二十九日，美国政府应苏修当局的邀请，在莫斯科举办了一个所谓“美国——工业美学”的展览会，大肆宣扬美国的“物质文明”和“生活方式”。苏修当局对这个展览会十分热心，殷勤效劳。
    苏联反动诗人叶夫图申科不久前访美时，极端无耻地在美国电视节目中朗读他的修正主义黑诗，并且大放媚美反华的厥词。据报道，苏修还决定派歌舞团去美国，参加定今年六、七月在纽约举行的“文化节”。
    这些事实说明，在反华、反共、反人民、反革命的“共同目标”下，美帝和苏修的反革命勾结已经达到何等亲密的程度。但是，它们勾结得越紧，就越加暴露出它们狼狈为奸、反对世界革命人民的罪恶图谋。
