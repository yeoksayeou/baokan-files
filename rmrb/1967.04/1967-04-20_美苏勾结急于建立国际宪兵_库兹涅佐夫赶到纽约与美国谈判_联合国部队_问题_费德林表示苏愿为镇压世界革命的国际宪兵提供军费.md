New York, April 19th—The Soviet revisionist leadership is preparing to discuss the establishment of an international police force, the so-called "United Nations Force," to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's peoples at the special session of the United Nations, which opens on the 21st. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov has already arrived in New York on the 17th to attend this meeting.

For a long time, the United Nations has been a tool for U.S. imperialism to implement its aggressive policies worldwide and a venue for U.S.-Soviet political deals. Using the United Nations as a cover to suppress revolutionary struggles around the world has been a key item in U.S.-Soviet deals. As early as 1965, the U.S. and the Soviet Union planned to establish a so-called "Special Committee on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations" to plan the establishment of an international police force, the "United Nations Force." However, due to disagreements over specific issues such as funding, this plan has been stalled. Now, as the U.S. and the Soviet Union become increasingly aligned in their efforts to suppress the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, other big and small deals are being finalized one after another, and both sides are eager to quickly realize this conspiracy.

It is under these circumstances that the Soviet government issued a memorandum on April 5th regarding the use of military forces by the United Nations to "maintain international peace and security." While loudly advocating the United Nations Charter, it vigorously promotes the need to strengthen the United Nations' "capabilities in maintaining peace and security" so that it can "take swift and effective action." Although the Soviet revisionist authorities also criticized the United States in this memorandum, their eagerness to quickly reach a deal with the United States on this issue is evident. Following this, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Fedorenko, last week at the "Special Committee on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations" discussion on the "United Nations Force" issue, expressed that the Soviet Union is willing to make "voluntary contributions" to the United Nations' finances, which is actually to provide funding for the establishment of this police force to suppress world revolution. Fedorenko's statement immediately received the approval of the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg.

Western news agencies, in commenting on the arrival of Kuznetsov, who is known for his high-level negotiations, to attend the meeting opening on the 21st, believe that his "arrival seems to have been carefully prepared," and it is possible that "important actions" may be taken at this meeting. The Soviet revisionist leadership's active role in collaborating with U.S. imperialism to establish an international police force, the "United Nations Force," once again exposes its traitorous face against the world's revolutionary peoples.

According to reports, Kuznetsov will also visit Washington during his activities in the United States to hold secret talks with the U.S. authorities on the Vietnam issue.

    美苏勾结急于建立国际宪兵
    库兹涅佐夫赶到纽约与美国谈判“联合国部队”问题
    费德林表示苏愿为镇压世界革命的国际宪兵提供军费
    新华社十九日讯　纽约消息：苏联修正主义领导集团正准备在二十一日开幕的联合国特别会议上，就建立一支镇压世界人民革命斗争的国际宪兵——“联合国部队”的问题，同美帝国主义加紧进行交易。出席这次会议的苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫已经在十七日到达纽约。
    长期以来，联合国一直是美帝国主义在全世界推行侵略政策的工具，是美、苏进行政治交易的场所，而利用联合国这块破招牌，来镇压世界各地的革命斗争，则是美、苏交易中的重要项目。早在一九六五年，美苏策划成立了一个所谓“联合国维持和平行动特别委员会”，来筹划建立充当国际宪兵的“联合国部队”。但是，由于双方在经费等具体问题上讨价还价，这项计划一直难产。现在，随着美苏在共同对付越南人民抗美救国斗争方面越勾越紧，其他方面的大小交易也一笔接着一笔拍板成交，双方都急于赶快实现这个阴谋。
    正是在这种情况下，苏联政府在四月五日就联合国使用军队“维持国际和平和安全”的问题发表一个备忘录，在大肆宣扬联合国宪章的同时，竭力鼓吹要加强联合国“维护和平和安全问题上的效能”，以便使它能“迅速地和有效地采取行动”。苏修当局尽管在这个备忘录中也骂了美国几句，但是希望迅速就这个问题同美国达成交易的急切心情却是溢于言表的。紧接着，苏联驻联合国代表费德林上星期在“联合国维持和平行动特别委员会”上讨论“联合国部队”问题时，表示苏联愿意对联合国的财政作出“自愿捐献”，实际上就是为建立这支镇压世界革命的宪兵部队提供军费。费德林的这一表示立即得到了美国驻联合国代表戈德堡的赞赏。
    西方通讯社在评论“以高级谈判代表闻名”的库兹涅佐夫出席二十一日开幕的会议时认为，他的“到达似乎是经过仔细准备的”，在这次会议上也许可能采取“重要行动”。苏联修正主义领导集团在伙同美帝国主义建立国际宪兵——“联合国部队”问题上如此积极，又一次暴露了它与世界革命人民为敌的叛徒嘴脸。
    据报道，库兹涅佐夫在美国活动期间还将访问华盛顿，同美国当局就越南问题进行密商。
