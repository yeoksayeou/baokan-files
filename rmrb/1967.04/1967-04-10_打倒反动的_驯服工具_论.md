A vast and magnificent mass movement of criticism is sweeping across the country!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to push forward the counter-revolutionary revisionist political line, has been vigorously advocating the revisionist organizational principle of slavery in the book *Self-Cultivation*. In 1958, he gave this principle a facelift and concretely summarized it as the "Tame Tool" theory, which he then put forth.

The emergence of the "Tame Tool" theory was by no means accidental.

In May 1958, at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the general line of building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and innovative spirit, and called on the people of the entire country to break away from superstition, liberate their thoughts, and promote the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line, the people of the entire country were full of enthusiasm, their spirits soared, and they achieved a great leap forward in the national economy that shook the world! The great proletarian revolutionary Chairman Mao gave enthusiastic praise and high evaluation to this unprecedented revolutionary mass movement. He said: "Never before have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor." "Do the Chinese laboring people still have the appearance of slaves from the past? No, they have become masters."

However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao. On June 30, he specially came to the old *Beijing Daily* to summarize a discussion organized by the old *Beijing Daily* on whether Communist Party members should have personal aspirations. The editor-in-chief of the old *Beijing Daily*, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Fan Jin, based on this speech, compiled an article titled "What Kind of Aspirations Should Communist Party Members Have," which was personally approved and published in the July 29 issue of the old *Beijing Daily*. Thus, the reactionary "Tame Tool" theory was officially put forth. The "Tame Tool" theory crazily opposes Mao Zedong Thought, crazily opposes the Party's general line for building socialism, and attempts to use slavery to shackle the hands and feet of the revolutionary masses, obstructing the deepening development of the socialist revolutionary cause.

The "Tame Tool" theory, which once caused a stir, spread its poison throughout the country and had a very bad influence. It must be thoroughly criticized!

The proponent of the "Tame Tool" theory stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, extremely despises the masses, regards the masses as "cattle" and "slaves," and rants that "cattle are living tools," "slave owners regard slaves as living tools," and "people are even more living tools." He distorts the relationship between the Party's leadership and Party members into an absolute obedience relationship between people and tools, slave owners and slaves.

Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." How to treat the masses is the dividing line between proletarian revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary revisionists. The top capitalist-roader within the Party regards the masses as "cattle," "slaves," and "living tools" to be driven at will. This is a great slander against the great Chinese people. It fully exposes his reactionary nature of opposing and hating the people.

The proponent of the "Tame Tool" theory pretends to be authoritative and uses "Party spirit" to intimidate people: those who do not want to be his "tame tool" are said to have no "Party spirit"; those who are "half-believing and half-doubting" of his words and have a "close but distant" relationship with him are said to have "bourgeois ideology." He even says: "Even if the majority and the upper levels or the central authorities are wrong, you should obey and first execute the errors." Otherwise, he will label you with a big hat of "causing organizational splits." In short, the "Party spirit" he talks about is "slavery" and "tameness"! It is to turn Party members into mindless machines that can be operated by anyone and can do anything.

To provide a basis for this fallacy, he dared to openly oppose Chairman Mao's class and class struggle theory, denying that class struggle in society must be reflected within the Party, denying that there has always been a struggle between two lines within the Party, and a struggle between Marxism and opportunism. He rants that Chen Duxiu and Wang Ming's right opportunist line was only for a "very short period" and was due to "lack of experience"; he rants that in the socialist period there are only "different methods of building communism." He covers up the essence of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, aiming to oppose Party members from raising their awareness of line struggle, abandoning principled struggle, and only emphasizing organizational obedience.

What kind of "Party spirit" is this? This is the "Party spirit" of revisionist parties! This is the "Party spirit" of fascist parties!

Chairman Mao said: "A Communist Party member should be open and aboveboard, loyal, active, and regard revolutionary interests as his first life, and personal interests as subordinate to revolutionary interests; at all times and in all places, he should uphold correct principles and engage in tireless struggle against all incorrect thoughts and actions..."

Communist Party members must not blindly follow, must not be slaves, and must have a high awareness of line struggle, distinguish between true and false, recognize the direction, firmly support and obey the leadership that implements the proletarian revolutionary line; firmly resist, struggle, and rebel against the leadership that implements the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and the bourgeois reactionary line, regardless of how high their position is, how great their reputation is, how senior their status is, and regardless of how much false majority they temporarily possess. Only this is the true Party spirit of the Communist Party!

The proponent of the "Tame Tool" theory talks about "ideals," saying that "having ideals and being a tame tool are consistent," and beautifully names it as a "vigorous and enterprising tame tool." He rants that following the "Party" can make one a "general," a "minister," that "individuals follow the development of history," and that "in the future, when writing history, your name will be written down," and so on. In short, "honor and wealth in life, fame after death," is the "ideal" he advocates.

This is a thorough and complete philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage"!

This is the logic of a thorough and complete opportunist who betrays the revolution!

This is the "ideal" of the thoroughly rotten exploiting class's individualism!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party wants to use this extreme individualism to corrupt our Party members, making them "tame" to revisionism; not only absolutely obedient in organization but also in thought, becoming their "convenient" tool for restoring capitalism.

The proponent of the "Tame Tool" theory maliciously distorts the relationship between the leader and the masses, saying with ulterior motives that "every Party member, revolutionary, chairman, premier, etc., are all tools," opposing us from establishing the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, opposing us from taking the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the entire Party. He even insinuates and viciously attacks our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, saying that "some people regard the Party as a car, and he is the one driving the car, wanting to climb onto the Party to control the Party!" How outrageous!

In fact, the one who regards the Party as a car is himself. It is he who wants to lower Chairman Mao to raise himself, to elevate himself, the Khrushchev of China, to heaven, to control the Party, and to lead the Party into the revisionist quagmire. How sinister his intentions are!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party says that the "tool theory" is a "fundamental theoretical issue of Marxism-Leninism." This is a great slander against Marxism-Leninism!

Where is there even a trace of Marxism-Leninism here? This is a pure and unadulterated revisionist theory, this is a thorough and complete "policy of fooling the people," this is the philosophy of the exploiting class to suppress the revolution and corrupt revolutionary will.

For a long time, the top capitalist-roader within the Party and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have been frantically advocating the "Tame Tool" theory, attempting to turn our broad masses of Party members into yes-men with slavish characteristics, into people with no great aspirations and blind eyes.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this "Tame Tool" theory has become an important weapon for them to oppose the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and to push forward the bourgeois reactionary line. They bring out "Party spirit," "organizational spirit," and "discipline" to suppress Party members from rebelling, not allowing Party members to make a revolution, in order to maintain their crumbling rule.

The article "On Khrushchev's Fake Communism and Its Lessons for World History" points out: "The bourgeoisie and international imperialism understand that to make a socialist country degenerate into a capitalist country, they must first make the Communist Party degenerate into a revisionist party." The top capitalist-roader within the Party advocates the "Tame Tool" theory, preaching slavery and extreme individualism, is to change our Party according to this "theory," making it degenerate into a revisionist party, a fascist party, and to carry out a capitalist restoration in our country.

The various lies fabricated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party about the "Tame Tool" theory, although they have deceived some people and poisoned some people. However, history is ruthless. Under the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have finally exposed this Khrushchev of China, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and his entire set of lies about the "Tame Tool" theory has finally been exposed.

Overthrow the reactionary "Tame Tool" theory!

### 打倒反动的“驯服工具”论

    打倒反动的“驯服工具”
    论《北京日报》四月七日社论
    彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫！
    彻底批判反毛泽东思想的大毒草《修养》！
    一个波澜壮阔的群众性的批判运动，正在全国蓬勃展开！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了推行反革命修正主义的政治路线，在《修养》中大肆鼓吹修正主义的组织原则——奴隶主义。一九五八年，他把这个组织原则作了一番梳妆打扮，具体概括为“驯服工具”论，抛了出来。
    “驯服工具”论的出笼，决不是偶然的。
    一九五八年五月，在党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议上，毛主席亲自主持制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，号召全国人民破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义精神。在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民干劲冲天，气壮山河，实现了震撼世界的国民经济全面大跃进！伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席，对这史无前例的革命群众运动给予热情的赞扬和极高的评价。他说：“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”“中国劳动人民还有过去那一副奴隶相么？没有了，他们做了主人了。”
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派公然与毛主席大唱反调。六月三十日，他专程来到旧《北京日报》社，为旧《北京日报》组织的“共产党员应不应该有个人志愿”的讨论，作了一次总结性的谈话。旧《北京日报》社社长、反革命修正主义分子范瑾，根据这次谈话，整理出一篇题为《共产党员应该有什么样的志愿》的社论，经过党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派亲自审定，发表在七月二十九日的旧《北京日报》上。这样，反动的“驯服工具”论，就正式出笼了。“驯服工具”论疯狂反对毛泽东思想，疯狂反对党的建设社会主义的总路线，妄图用奴隶主义束缚革命群众的手脚，阻碍社会主义革命事业的深入发展。
    喧嚣一时的“驯服工具”论，流毒全国，影响极坏，必须痛加批判！
      “驯服工具”论的提出者，站在资产阶级反动立场上，极端鄙视群众，把群众视为“牛马”、“奴隶”，胡说什么“牛马是活工具”，“奴隶主看奴隶是活工具”，“人更是活工具”；把党的领导和党员群众的关系，歪曲成人和工具、奴隶主和奴隶的绝对服从关系。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”如何对待人民群众，是区别无产阶级革命家和反革命修正主义分子的分水岭。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把人民群众当成“牛马”、“奴隶”和任凭驱使的“活工具”，这是对伟大的中国人民的极大诬蔑。这充分暴露了他敌视人民、反对人民的反动本质。
     “驯服工具”论的提出者，装腔作势地抬出“党性”来吓唬人：什么不愿做他的驯服工具就是没有“党性”啦；对他的话“半信半疑”，和他的关系“若即若离”，就是“资产阶级思想”啦。他还胡说：“即使大多数和上级或中央真错了，你也要服从，先照错误的去执行。”否则，他就给你扣上一个“引起组织分裂”的大帽子。总之，他所说的“党性”就是“奴隶性”，就是“驯服性”！就是要党员变成没有头脑的机器，谁开都可以，干什么都行。
    为了给他这种谬论制造根据，他胆大包天，竟然公开对抗毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争学说，否认社会上的阶级斗争必然要反映到党内来，否认党内一直存在着两条路线的斗争，存在着马克思主义和机会主义的斗争。他胡说什么陈独秀、王明的右倾机会主义路线只是“很短的时期”，是由于“没有经验造成的”；胡说什么在社会主义时期只有“建设共产主义方法的不同”。他掩盖党内两条路线斗争的实质，目的就是反对党员提高路线斗争的觉悟，放弃原则斗争，只讲组织服从。
    这是什么“党性”？这是修正主义党的“党性”！这是法西斯党的“党性”！
    毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，……”
    共产党员绝不能盲从，不能做奴隶，必须有高度的路线斗争的觉悟，明辨真假，认清方向，对执行无产阶级革命路线的领导，坚决拥护，坚决服从；对执行反革命修正主义路线和资产阶级反动路线的领导，不管他职位多高，声望多大，资格多老，不管暂时拥有怎样的虚假的多数，都要坚决抵制，坚决斗争，坚决造反，决不搞“和平共处”，决不搞“绝对服从”。这才是真正的共产党的党性！
    “驯服工具”论的提出者，大谈什么“理想”，说什么“有理想和做驯服工具是一致的”，并美其名曰这是“奋发有为的驯服工具”。他胡说什么跟着“党”走就能当“将军”，当“部长”，“个人顺着历史的发展”，“将来写历史的时候，写上你一个名字”，等等，等等。一句话，“生前荣华富贵，死后名垂千古”，就是他所鼓吹的“理想”。
    这是地地道道的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学！
    这是彻头彻尾的投革命之机的个人野心家的逻辑！
    这是腐烂透顶的剥削阶级的个人主义的“理想”！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，想用这种极端的个人主义来腐蚀我们党员，要我们党员奋个人之“发”，有个人之“为”，“驯服”于修正主义；不仅组织上绝对服从，而且思想上也和他们同流合污，成为他们复辟资本主义的“得心应手”的工具。
      “驯服工具”论的提出者，肆意歪曲领袖和群众的关系，别有用心地说什么“我们每个党员、革命者、主席、总理等等都是工具”，反对我们树立伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，反对我们把战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为全党的指导思想。他甚至含沙射影，恶毒攻击我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，说什么“有些人把党当成汽车，他是开汽车的，想爬到党的身上驾驭党！”真是猖狂之极！
    其实，把党当成汽车的正是他自己。正是他，想通过贬低毛主席来抬高自己，把他这个中国的赫鲁晓夫捧上天去，驾驭党，把党引向修正主义泥坑。其用心何其毒也！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派说什么“工具论”是“马克思列宁主义的基本理论问题”。这是对马克思列宁主义的极大诬蔑！
    这里哪有一丝一毫马克思列宁主义的味道？这是不折不扣的修正主义理论，这是地地道道的“愚民政策”，这是压制革命、腐蚀革命意志的剥削阶级的哲学。
    长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，拚命鼓吹“驯服工具”论，妄图使我们广大党员变成唯唯诺诺、奴性十足的庸人，变成胸无大志、两眼漆黑的糊涂虫。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，这种“驯服工具”论又成为他们对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，推行资产阶级反动路线的重要武器。他们搬出什么“党性”、“组织性”、“纪律性”来压制党员造反，不许党员革命，以维持他们行将崩溃的统治。
    《关于赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义及其在世界历史上的教训》一文指出：“资产阶级和国际帝国主义懂得，要使社会主义国家蜕变为资本主义国家，首先要使共产党蜕变为修正主义的党。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，鼓吹“驯服工具”论，宣扬奴隶主义和极端个人主义，就是要按照这种“理论”改造我们的党，使它蜕变为修正主义的党，法西斯的党，在我国实行资本主义复辟。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派编造的“驯服工具”论的种种鬼话，虽然蒙骗了一些人，毒害了一些人。但是，历史是无情的。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，亿万革命群众终于把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫、党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来，他那一套“驯服工具”论的欺人之谈终于破产了。
    打倒反动的“驯服工具”论！
