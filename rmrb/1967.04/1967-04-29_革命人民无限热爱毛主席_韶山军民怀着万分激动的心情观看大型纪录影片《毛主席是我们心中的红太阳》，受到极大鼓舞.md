The feature-length documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" began its grand screening in the hometown of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, Xiangtan County's Shaoshan, on April 26. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and People's Liberation Army soldiers watched this film with hearts filled with boundless excitement and were greatly inspired. They unanimously declared that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When the news of the film's screening in Shaoshan spread, the revolutionary people of Shaoshan were overjoyed and spread the word. That day, Shaoshan Village was filled with festive joy, presenting a scene of celebration. Revolutionary masses carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao, singing revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," beating drums and gongs, celebrating the film's premiere. By nightfall, nearly ten thousand revolutionary masses gathered from all directions in the square, some traveling from places twenty miles away. They said, the screening of this film, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a great joy for all the revolutionary people of Shaoshan and the nation! They joined the thousands of revolutionary masses on the screen in cheering and jumping, repeatedly shouting: Long live our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! We wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!

At this moment of boundless happiness, the revolutionary people of Shaoshan recalled the glorious history of the nation's people fighting bravely under Chairman Mao's wise leadership for decades. From the bottom of their hearts, they loved Chairman Mao dearly. They said, it was Chairman Mao who saved us from the evil old society, it was Chairman Mao who led us onto the path of socialism, it was Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led us in carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the nation and the world, ensuring that the socialist motherland's ironclad mountains and rivers will never change color! Chairman Mao's heart is always connected with ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the revolutionary people! The responsible person of the Cultural Revolutionary Committee of Shaoshan People's Commune said: In 1959, our great leader Chairman Mao returned to Shaoshan, and we were fortunate to see Chairman Mao; today, we see Chairman Mao again on the screen, as if Chairman Mao has returned to Shaoshan and is among us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao is always in our hearts. Chairman Mao loves the revolutionary people dearly, and we poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary people, love Chairman Mao dearly! We will definitely read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will definitely thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

The Red Guards from Shaoshan School who went to the capital to accept Chairman Mao's inspection on National Day last year watched this film and recalled the scene of standing by Chairman Mao's side on National Day, with Chairman Mao waving and smiling at them. They were even more excited, as if they were back by Chairman Mao's side. Some Red Guards excitedly said, Chairman Mao taught us: "The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." We will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and resolutely complete the great historical task of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms, and will not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations.

Su Guozheng, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a five-star soldier from the Third Company of a certain military unit, has been eagerly looking forward to seeing Chairman Mao on the screen since the newspaper published the news of the film's screening. His wish finally came true. When the scene of our great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vitality, ascending the Tiananmen Rostrum appeared on the screen, he was so moved that tears of happiness streamed down his face. He said, Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for the people of the nation and the world! Chairman Mao cares about the people the most, trusts the people the most, and supports the people's pioneering spirit the most. We will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for a lifetime. We will definitely respond to the call of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, learn the "Three Articles" as our motto, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and at the same time, do a good job in supporting agriculture and strengthening preparedness. If the American imperialists dare to invade, we will definitely annihilate them!

    革命人民无限热爱毛主席
    韶山军民怀着万分激动的心情观看大型纪录影片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》，受到极大鼓舞
    新华社长沙二十八日电　《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》大型彩色文献纪录片，二十六日开始在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡湘潭县韶山隆重上映。广大贫下中农、红卫兵小将、革命干部和解放军战士，怀着万分激动的心情看了这部电影，受到了极大的鼓舞。他们纷纷表示，一定要永远忠于毛主席，一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    当这部影片在韶山上映的消息传开以后，韶山革命人民欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。这一天，韶山冲里喜气洋洋，呈现一片节日景象。革命群众抬着毛主席巨幅画像，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，敲锣打鼓，庆贺影片上映。入夜，革命群众近万人从四面八方汇集在广场上，有的从一二十里外的地方赶来。他们说，这部闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的影片的上映，是全韶山革命人民、全国革命人民的大喜事！他们和银幕上的千百万革命群众共同欢呼、跳跃，一次又一次地高呼：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在这无限幸福的时刻，韶山革命人民回想起全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，进行了几十年英勇革命斗争的光辉历程，从内心里无限热爱毛主席。他们说，是毛主席把我们从万恶的旧社会里拯救出来，是毛主席领导我们走上了社会主义大道，是毛主席亲自发动和领导我们开展了震撼全国和全世界的无产阶级文化大革命，保证社会主义祖国的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色！毛主席和我们贫下中农、革命人民时刻心连着心！韶山公社贫下中农文化革命委员会负责人说：一九五九年，伟大领袖毛主席回到韶山，我们无限幸福地看到了毛主席；今天，我们在银幕上又见到毛主席，好象毛主席又回到了韶山，来到了我们贫下中农中间。毛主席永远和我们心连心。毛主席无限热爱革命人民，我们贫下中农、革命人民无限热爱毛主席！我们一定更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们一定要彻底把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批深、批透、批臭，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    去年国庆节到首都接受毛主席检阅的韶山学校红卫兵小将们，看了这部影片，回想起国庆节那天站在毛主席身旁，毛主席向他们亲切招手、微笑的情景，更加欢欣鼓舞，好象又回到了毛主席身边。有的红卫兵小将激动地说，毛主席教导我们：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”我们一定照毛主席的指示办事，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，坚决完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务，决不辜负毛主席对我们的殷切期望。
    驻军某部三连学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士苏国政，自从报纸上发表这部影片上映的消息那天起，就渴望早日在银幕上看到毛主席。他的愿望终于实现了。当一轮红日跃出大海，我们伟大领袖毛主席满面红光、神采奕奕地登上天安门城楼的镜头出现在银幕上时，他激动得流下了幸福的热泪。他说，毛主席身体这样健康，这是全国人民、全世界人民最大的幸福！毛主席最关心群众，最信任群众，最支持革命群众的首创精神。我们决心读一辈子毛主席的书，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。我们一定响应毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，同时做好支农工作，加强战备。如果美帝国主义胆敢来侵犯，我们一定把它彻底消灭掉！
