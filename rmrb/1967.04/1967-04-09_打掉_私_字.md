Chairman Mao teaches us that to make revolution, we must "resolve to struggle, be prepared to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The first sentence is about resolving to struggle. In seizing the revolution and promoting production, the first issue to address is also one of resolve. To resolve to struggle, one must first fight against the "self" character and remove the "self" mountain from one's mind.

I had some shortcomings and mistakes in the past. The masses gave me criticism, and big-character posters were put up, which made me very unhappy. Therefore, when the leadership called on me to participate in leading spring plowing production, I had a resistant attitude. Later, I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and I felt my face burning with shame. The foolish old man, for the sake of his family's future, made such a great resolve to dig away the mountains. Our spring plowing production has even greater significance than moving mountains. Why didn't I have as much resolve as the foolish old man? The reason is only one: there is a "self" mountain in my mind. The masses giving me criticism is to help me better serve the people. In the busy time of spring plowing production, how can I let the "self" character bend my back? The revolutionary spirit is not as strong as that of an ancient old man, how can I be a good militia member of Chairman Mao? I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolve to seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production. After a fierce struggle, I removed the "self" mountain, and only then could I stand tall and take on the responsibility of participating in leading spring plowing production.

I realize that to carry forward the spirit of the foolish old man moving mountains and overcome all difficulties, the most important thing is to use Chairman Mao's works as a weapon, thoroughly remove the "self" mountain, and free oneself from the "I." Only in this way can one muster the spirit to strive for victory in both revolution and production.

### 打掉“私”字

    打掉“私”字
    民兵营长　周桂松
    毛主席教导我们干革命要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这四句话，第一句是下定决心。抓革命，促生产，第一个要解决的也是个决心问题。要下定决心，先要同“私”字斗，把脑子里的“私”字山移掉。
    我过去有些缺点和错误，群众给我提意见，还贴大字报，我很不高兴。所以，这次领导上叫我参加领导春耕生产，我有抵触情绪。后来我学习了《愚公移山》，只觉得脸上发烧。老愚公为了自家的出路，下那么大的决心挖山，我们搞春耕生产，意义比愚公移山大得多，决心为什么没有愚公大呢？原因只有一个，就是脑子里有座“私”字山。群众给我提意见，是为了要我更好地为人民服务，在春耕生产的紧张时刻，我怎么能够让“私”字压弯腰呢？干革命的劲头还不如古时候的一个老人，怎么能做一个毛主席的好民兵呢？我一定要听毛主席的话，下决心狠抓革命，猛促生产。经过狠斗，挖掉了“私”字山，我才挺起腰杆，挑起参加领导春耕生产的担子。
    我体会到，发扬愚公移山精神，战胜各种困难，最要紧的是要以毛主席著作为武器，彻底挖掉“私”字山，从“我”字中解放出来。这样，才能鼓足干劲，去夺取革命、生产双胜利。
