The U.S. imperialist-controlled "aid to India consortium," after the Indian government recently agreed to sell out national interests and absorb a large amount of U.S. capital, decided on the 6th to provide this reactionary government with a large amount of "aid."

The "aid to India consortium," composed of the United States, Canada, Japan, and some European capitalist countries as well as the World Bank controlled by U.S. imperialism, decided at a meeting in Paris to provide India with 10 million tons of grain this year and to prepare to provide India with $1.3 billion (including grain) in economic "aid."

Last year, U.S. imperialism and the World Bank it controls repeatedly pressured the Indian government to sell out more national interests and agreed to help U.S. monopoly capital establish a fertilizer industry in India to exploit the Indian people. The Indian reactionary government, in order to beg for more "aid," hurriedly announced a few days before the "aid to India consortium" meeting that it would extend the deadline for granting privileges to foreign private capital to invest in and establish fertilizer factories in India from the end of March to the end of this year, satisfying the demands of U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism continues to use its "aid" to pressure the Indian government to sell out more sovereignty and accept the so-called "India-U.S. Education Fund." This scheme, proposed by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi last year, involves using most of the funds obtained from selling U.S. "aid" grain for the supposed "development of education," actually to provide U.S. imperialism with a means to carry out large-scale cultural infiltration and espionage activities in India. This scheme has been temporarily shelved due to opposition from Indian patriots.

U.S. Agency for International Development Director William Gaud revealed on the 5th to the U.S. Congress Foreign Affairs Committee that the U.S. government continues to try to implement this "proposal," hoping that the Indian government will realize it soon.

    印政府卖国求“援”
    延长外资特权期限换取大量美“援”
    新华社讯　新德里消息：美帝国主义控制的“援印财团”，在印度政府最近答应出卖民族利益、大量吸收美国资本以后，六日决定给予这个反动政府以大量“援助”。
    由美国、加拿大、日本和一些欧洲资本主义国家以及美帝控制的世界银行所组成的“援印财团”，在巴黎举行的会议上决定，今年内向印度提供一千万吨粮食，并且准备以十三亿美元（包括粮食）为目标，向印度提供经济“援助”。
    去年，美帝国主义和它控制的世界银行，一再压印度政府出卖更多的民族利益，同意帮助美国垄断资本在印度建立一个用来剥削印度人民的化肥工业。印度反动政府为了乞讨更多的“援助”，就在这次“援印财团”会议举行前几天，赶忙宣布把给予外国私人资本在印度投资建立化肥厂的特权的期限，从三月底延长到今年年底，满足了美帝国主义的要求。
    美帝国主义继续利用它的“援助”，压印度政府出卖更多主权，接受所谓“印美教育基金”。由美国总统约翰逊在去年向印度总理英迪拉·甘地提出的这个阴谋计划，内容是把出售美“援”粮食后所得的大部分款项，以“发展教育”为名，实际上供给美帝国主义用来对印度进行大规模的文化侵略和特务活动。这个阴谋受到印度爱国人士的反对而暂时搁置。
    美国国际开发署署长威廉·高德五日在美国国会外交委员会透露，美国政府继续设法实行这个“建议”，希望印度政府日内会实现它。
