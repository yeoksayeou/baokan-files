The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee firmly implements Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, resolutely opposes the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and helps the vast majority of cadres stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses.

As early as the socialist education movement in 1964, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee faithfully carried out the line of "left" in form but right in essence advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party. They labeled more than 60-70% of the cadres in the places where they "squatted" as "rotten" and overthrew them all. It was only after Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Twenty-Three Articles" that these cadres who had been struck down were liberated.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, this small handful of capitalist-roaders once again faithfully carried out the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" from their backstage boss—the top capitalist-roader in the Party. They sent out a large number of work teams, on the one hand, striking down the revolutionary masses, and on the other hand, striking down the cadres. They spread the idea of "first release, then strike" among the masses and cadres, saying that they should let the masses "release," and that "without a certain temperature, the monsters and demons cannot be released." They said that "releasing" could "choose the appropriate time to counterattack," and that "exposing the bad elements during the movement is a great thing, and one can make a fortune." They instigated a "big mess and big slaughter" among the masses and cadres, proposing to "expose whatever problems there are" and "expose whoever has problems," even saying that "whatever is thought of, seen, felt, real or fake, should be universally exposed." They also "registered" the cadres and carried out so-called "left, middle, right" rankings. In this way, they labeled a large number of good and relatively good cadres as "counter-revolutionaries," "ambitionists," "traitors," "monsters and demons," and so on.

This small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are most afraid of the cadres rising up to rebel against them and most afraid of the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses uniting to overthrow them. They said: "If the cadres and students unite in an organization, all situations will be exposed." Therefore, they used threats, hints, deception, and enticement to put various shackles on the cadres, vigorously advocating "internal and external distinctions," and eagerly peddling the ideas from "On Cultivation" to poison the cadres, making them dare not support the revolutionary masses and dare not stand up to rebel.

The small handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee used their usurped power to carry out the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, creating a very bad influence in Shandong. After the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee took power, the cadre issue became one of the most serious problems. The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, using the great power it had seized to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue and eliminate its poison. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee seriously studied the "Twenty-Three Articles" and "Sixteen Articles" formulated by Chairman Mao, as well as relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine. They firmly believed in the correct judgment of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought that the majority of cadres are good and relatively good and are revolutionary. They adopted a serious, active, and enthusiastic attitude towards the cadres. The Revolutionary Committee widely propagated Chairman Mao's policy on cadres to the revolutionary mass organizations, the revolutionary masses, and the cadres, and organized the revolutionary masses to discuss and study, quickly liberating a large number of good and relatively good cadres who had been struck down and persecuted. Among them, many leading cadres who insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs and became the backbone and core forces in the struggle to seize and hold power, with the support of the revolutionary mass organizations.

For cadres who have made mistakes, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee analyzed them with a dialectical view, believing that on the one hand, they had executed the bourgeois reactionary line to varying degrees; on the other hand, they were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. Because the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee blocked Chairman Mao's voice, praised the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and portrayed themselves as "consistently correct," many cadres were deceived. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." As long as they were not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements and did not insist on their mistakes and refuse to change, they were allowed to reform and encouraged to redeem themselves.

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee specially convened a meeting on cadres, on the one hand, propagating Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and on the other hand, helping cadres who had made mistakes to solve the problems of how to stand up, where to stand, and what to do after standing up. How can cadres who have made mistakes be considered as standing up? The Revolutionary Committee believed that the most important thing is to draw a clear line with the top capitalist-roader in the Party, draw a clear line with the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee, and draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line. Cadres who have made mistakes must first make a thorough confession to the revolutionary masses about their mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line and launch a counterattack, thoroughly exposing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders within the Party who instructed them to execute the bourgeois reactionary line. Only in this way can they be considered as truly standing up. The Revolutionary Committee pointed out that cadres who have made mistakes and stand up must stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "politically take the lead, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," put down their airs, go among the masses, be willing to be small students, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the masses to truly win the trust of the masses. Cadres who have made mistakes and stand up must strive for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and for "grasp revolution, promote production" to achieve new merits. If they continue to be officials and lords after standing up, or even settle accounts with the revolutionary masses, that would be extremely wrong. In short, whether or not they have stood up is not judged by form or whether they have issued statements, but by whether their stance and feelings have changed. These pointed out the direction and path for the cadres who have made mistakes. The revolutionary masses also did a lot of detailed political and ideological work for these cadres. Under the help of the Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses, a large number of cadres who had made mistakes gradually woke up. They removed their doubts, put down their burdens, and moved forward lightly, changing their stance and standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Among them, some even participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs.

The small handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee particularly hated those revolutionary cadres who dared to fight against them and had severely excluded and struck down them. The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, for those who had opposed the revolutionary faction under the deception of the bourgeois reactionary line, even persecuted the revolutionary faction, and were proven to have made mistakes, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's teaching: "Not only should we unite with those who agree with us, but we should also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. We should also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." The Revolutionary Committee strove to unite with these people and work together, and some were even given certain leadership responsibilities. This spirit of putting the overall situation first and putting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line first deeply moved these cadres who had made mistakes in the past.

To save the leading cadres who had made mistakes, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee adopted an attitude of waiting, observing, and helping them, and held a "Meeting to Expose and Criticize the Small Handful of Capitalist-Roaders within the Former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee" for a relatively long period, with the participation of leading cadres at the prefectural level and above and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. This meeting provided an opportunity for those leading cadres who had made mistakes to draw a clear line with the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, and an opportunity for them to redeem themselves. The meeting also allowed them to defend themselves, clarify the facts, and reason out the issues, making those who had made mistakes sincerely convinced. The Revolutionary Committee also used the meeting to educate these leading cadres on how to carry the revolution through to the end and maintain revolutionary integrity, requiring them to bravely face their mistakes and correct them, and return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao as soon as possible.

In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, some capitalist-roaders within the Party disguised themselves, attempting to sneak into the "three-in-one" leadership cadre and realize the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses together timely exposed and struggled against their plots in an irreconcilable manner.

The result of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee's firm implementation of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres is that it has united a large number of cadres throughout the province and greatly isolated the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

### 帮助大多数干部站到毛主席革命路线一边

    山东省革命委员会坚决反对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策
    帮助大多数干部站到毛主席革命路线一边
    向革命的群众组织、广大的革命群众和干部，广泛宣传了毛主席的干部政策，使大批受打击、受迫害的好的和比较好的干部很快地解放出来。
    本报济南十七日电　山东省革命委员会坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，坚决反对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，帮助绝大多数干部站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和广大革命群众一起并肩战斗。
    早在一九六四年的社会主义教育运动中，前山东省委、省人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，便在他们“蹲点”的一些地方，忠实地推行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派形“左”实右的路线。他们把这些地方的百分之六七十以上的干部说成是“烂掉了”，一律打倒。毛主席亲自主持制定了二十三条以后，这些地方大批受打击的干部才得到解放。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，又不折不扣地从他们的后台老板——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派那里，搬来了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，派出大量工作组，一方面打击广大革命群众，一方面打击广大干部。他们在群众和干部中搞什么“先放后打”，说什么要让群众“放”，“不到一定温度，牛鬼蛇神放不出来”，
  “放”了可以“选择适当时机进行反击”，“运动中坏人暴露出来是大好事，可以发个财。”他们在群众和干部中搞“大混战、大厮杀”，提出“有什么问题就揭什么问题，什么人有问题就揭什么人”，甚至说什么“想到的，看到的，感觉到的，真的，假的，都要普遍揭发”。他们还把干部“立上户头”，大搞所谓“左、中、右”排队。就这样，把大批好的和比较好的干部打成“反革命”、“野心家”、“叛徒”、“牛鬼蛇神”，等等。
    这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，最害怕广大干部起来造他们的反，最害怕革命干部和革命群众结合起来，革他们的命。他们说：“一个机关，要是干部跟学生结合起来，什么情况都弄出去了。”因此，他们采取威吓、旁敲侧击、欺骗拉拢等卑鄙手段，给干部套上种种枷锁，大肆鼓吹“内外有别”，并且竭力贩卖《修养》上的那一套，来毒害干部，使干部不敢支持革命群众，不敢站出来造反。
    前山东省委、省人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，利用他们窃踞的权力，推行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，在山东造成了极为恶劣的影响，使干部问题成为山东省革命委员会掌权以后最严重的问题之一。山东省革命委员会坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，运用已夺得的大权，大力批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，肃清其流毒。革命委员会的领导成员认真学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的二十三条和十六条，学习了《红旗》杂志的有关社论，坚定地相信大多数干部是好的和比较好的、是要革命的这一马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的英明论断，对干部采取了严肃、积极、热情的态度。革命委员会向革命的群众组织、广大革命群众和广大干部，广泛地宣传了毛主席的干部政策，并组织广大革命群众讨论研究，使大批受打击、受迫害的好的和比较好的干部很快解放出来。其中，许多坚持无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，参加了革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，他们在革命群众组织的支持下，成了夺权和掌权斗争中的骨干力量和核心力量。
    对于犯有错误的干部，山东省革命委员会以一分为二的观点对他们进行了分析，认为他们一方面在不同程度上执行了资产阶级反动路线；另一方面，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。因为前省委、省人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派封锁毛主席的声音，吹捧党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，并把自己打扮成“一贯正确”的样子，使很多干部受了蒙蔽。因此，山东省革命委员会坚定地执行毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就允许他们改过，并鼓励他们将功赎罪。
    省革命委员会专门召开了有关干部的会议，一面宣传毛主席的干部政策，一面帮助犯有错误的干部，解决怎样站出来、站到那里去、站出来干什么等问题。犯有错误的干部怎样才算站出来？革命委员会认为，最重要的是要和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，和省委、省人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，和资产阶级反动路线划清界限。犯有错误的干部，必须首先把自己执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，向革命群众作彻底交代，并大杀回马枪，把指使自己执行资产阶级反动路线的党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行彻底揭发出来，只有这样，才能算是真正的站出来。革命委员会指出，犯有错误的干部站出来，只有站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，响应毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的伟大号召，放下架子，到群众里面去，甘当小学生，和群众并肩战斗，才能真正取得群众的信任。犯有错误的干部站出来，要为保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，为无产阶级文化大革命，为
  “抓革命，促生产”立新功，如果站出来后继续当官做老爷，甚至和革命群众算账，那就是极端错误的。总之，有没有站出来，不是看形式，不是看有没有发表声明，而是看立场有没有改变，看思想感情有没有改变。这些，都给犯有错误的干部指出了方向和道路。广大革命群众也对这些干部做了很多细致的政治思想工作。在革命委员会和革命群众的帮助下，大批犯有错误的干部先后醒悟过来。他们解除了疑虑，放下了包袱，轻装前进，改变了立场，站到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。其中，有些人还参加了革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。
    前省委、省人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对敢于向他们进行斗争的革命干部特别恨之入骨，曾经加以严重的排斥和打击。山东省革命委员会对于在资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽下曾经反对过革命派，甚至打击迫害过革命派，而且事实证明是犯了错误的人，毫不犹豫地执行了毛主席的教导：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”革命委员会争取和这些人搞好团结，一同工作，有的还要他们担当一定的领导责任。这种以大局为重、以毛主席的革命路线为重的精神，使这些过去犯了错误的干部十分感动。
    为了挽救那些犯有错误的领导干部，山东省革命委员会对他们采取了等、看、帮的态度，并且以较长的时间，举行了“揭发批判前山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派会议”，由地委以上的领导干部和革命群众组织的代表参加。这个会议，给那些犯了错误的领导干部提供了同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线划清界限的机会，提供了他们将功赎罪的机会。会议也允许他们为自己辩护，通过摆事实，讲道理，把问题弄清，使犯错误的人心悦诚服。革命委员会还通过会议，向这些领导干部进行了把革命进行到底，保持革命晚节的教育，要求他们勇敢地正视自己的错误和改正错误，早日回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    在贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的过程中，一些党内走资本主义道路的当权派把自己梳装打扮起来，妄图钻进“三结合”的领导班子，实现资本主义反革命复辟。山东省革命委员会和广大革命群众一起，及时地识破和揭露了他们的阴谋，同他们进行了不调和的斗争。
    山东省革命委员会坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的结果，在全省范围内团结了大批干部，极大地孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
