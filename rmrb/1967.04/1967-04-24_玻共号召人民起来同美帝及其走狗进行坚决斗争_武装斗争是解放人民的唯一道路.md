The Bolivian Communist Party Political Committee recently issued an open letter to the nation, calling on the Bolivian people to resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Bolivia. The letter states that "the only path to liberate the people is through armed struggle and revolution."

The letter says that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its plunder, "controlling the economic lifeblood, finances, and other aspects of Bolivian national life." The pro-American dictatorship of Barrientos "relies on the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon, handing over natural resources to U.S. imperialism, such as the Matilde mine, oil fields to the Gulf Oil Company, rural schools to foreign religious missions, and allowing private universities to operate, all while submitting to the conditions imposed by U.S. loans." The U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries brutally exploit and oppress the Bolivian people, leaving the masses in a miserable state. "The process of colonialization of the country is now a fait accompli."

The letter points out that Bolivia has engaged in various forms of struggle against U.S. imperialism and the domestic reactionaries. The pro-American reactionary government in Bolivia has carried out large-scale arrests, exiles, and tortures of those fighting for national liberation, attempting to terrorize the people. However, recently, the appearance of guerrilla forces in Bolivia "means that the people can no longer tolerate this."

The Bolivian Communist Party's open letter emphasizes: "We believe that the only path to liberate the people is through armed struggle and revolution." Now, American bandits, to protect the interests of monopoly capital, "are openly and shamelessly interfering, with U.S. military personnel and the Bolivian army general staff acting in concert, for example, in dealing with the guerrillas."

The letter calls on the Bolivian people to "fight against the U.S. interventionists and their agents who sell out the country's resources and sovereignty." It emphasizes, "The people should fight with this belief and confidence: U.S. imperialism will definitely be defeated worldwide. The victory of the people is inevitable. The people should organize and establish a broad people's front to build an anti-imperialist people's government that can solve the country's problems."

According to the Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd, La Paz: The Bolivian Communist Party's official newspaper, "Liberation," in its recent issue, published an editorial condemning the pro-American dictatorship of Barrientos for declaring the Bolivian Communist Party "illegal" and reaffirming that the Bolivian Communist Party will continue to lead the proletariat in the struggle for national independence.

The editorial states: Now, due to the adoption of fascist repression measures at home, the struggle of the Bolivian people is facing extremely difficult circumstances. However, no matter how fascist the methods, no matter how cunning the repression tactics used by the dictatorship, they cannot make the people who insist on the struggle for national liberation retreat. "We know that the logic of the reactionaries is to create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they are completely defeated. On the contrary, the logic of the people is to struggle, fail, struggle again, until they achieve complete victory."

The editorial emphasizes: We communists, whether there is repression or not, whether we are legal or not, will always stand at the forefront of the struggle. Therefore, the reactionaries should know that history has already passed judgment on you. We communists will win the whole world.

    玻共号召人民起来同美帝及其走狗进行坚决斗争
    武装斗争是解放人民的唯一道路
    据新华社二十三日讯  拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党政治委员会最近发表告全国人民书，号召玻利维亚人民起来为反对美帝国主义及其在玻利维亚的代理人进行坚决的斗争，同时指出，“解放人民的唯一道路是通过武装斗争进行革命”。
    告人民书说，美帝国主义加紧掠夺，“控制了玻利维亚的经济命脉、财政和国家生活的其他方面”。巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政府“依赖于美国国务院和五角大楼，把自然资源交给了美帝国主义，如马蒂尔德矿，把油田交给了海湾石油公司，把农村学校交给了外国宗教使团，并允许私人开办大学，屈从于美国贷款所要求的条件。”美玻反动派残暴剥削和压迫玻利维亚人民，使广大人民处于悲惨的境地，“国家的殖民地化的过程已是一个既成事实”。
    告人民书指出，玻利维亚为反对美帝国主义及本国反动派进行了各种形式的斗争。玻利维亚亲美反动政府大规模地逮捕、流放和拷打争取民族解放斗争的人，企图以此来恐吓人民，但是最近，玻利维亚“游击队的出现，意味着人民再也不能容忍了。”
    玻利维亚共产党的告人民书强调指出：“我们认为，解放人民的唯一道路是通过武装斗争进行革命。”现在，美国强盗为了保护垄断资本的利益，“公然肆无忌惮地进行干涉，美国军人和玻利维亚陆军参谋部联合行动，例如对付游击队。”
    告人民书号召玻利维亚人民起来“为反对美国干涉主义者及其出卖本国资源和主权的代理人而斗争。”它强调指出，“人民应该怀着这种信念和信心而斗争：美帝国主义一定在全世界被打败。人民的胜利是不可避免的。人民应该组织起来，建立一个广泛的人民阵线，以便建立一个能够解决本国问题的反帝的人民政府。”
    据新华社二十三日讯  拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党机关报《解放报》在最近一期上发表社论，谴责巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权宣布玻利维亚共产党为“非法”，并重申玻利维亚共产党将继续率领无产阶级进行争取民族独立的斗争。
    社论说：现在，由于国内正在采取法西斯的镇压措施，因此玻利维亚人民的斗争面临着极其困难的局势，但是，无论法西斯手段也好，无论独裁政权使用狡猾的镇压手段也好，都不能使坚持民族解放斗争的人民后退。“我们知道，反动派的逻辑就是，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至他们彻底失败。但是相反，人民的逻辑是，斗争，失败，再斗争，直至彻底胜利。”
    社论强调说：我们共产党人不管有没有镇压，不管非法不非法，都将永远站在斗争的前线，所以反动派应该知道，历史已经给你们作了判决，我们共产党人将赢得整个世界。
