The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on the U.S. Imperialists' Mad Bombing of Haiphong

The Chinese People Angrily Denounce the New Crimes of the U.S. Imperialists

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people are determined to unite with the Vietnamese people, fight alongside them, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

New China News Agency, April 25th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on April 25th, angrily denouncing the U.S. imperialists' latest mad and large-scale bombing of Haiphong, and reiterating the Chinese government and people's firm support for the Vietnamese government and people's just stance. The statement emphasized that under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people are determined to bear the greatest national sacrifices, to forever unite with and fight alongside the Vietnamese people, to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, and to never rest until the goal is achieved.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

April 25, 1967

On April 20th, while U.S. bandit planes were carrying out indiscriminate bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they once again madly and on a large scale bombed the industrial and residential areas of Haiphong, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people angrily denounce this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism.

On April 21st, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, strongly condemning this barbaric war action of U.S. imperialism, and reaffirming the Vietnamese people's determination to resist aggression and fight to the end. The Chinese government and people firmly support this just stance of the Vietnamese government and people.

The U.S. bandits' savage bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the large-scale bombing of Haiphong are signals of U.S. imperialism's further escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam.

Everyone knows that in the war of aggression against Vietnam, although the U.S. imperialists have deployed more than 400,000 U.S. aggressor troops and used most of their naval and air forces, they have suffered heavy losses in the face of the Vietnamese people's heroic resistance. The so-called "dry season offensive" launched by the U.S. imperialists since last October will actually end in an even greater defeat. This once again proves that the people of South Vietnam are growing stronger with each battle, that the power of people's war is invincible, and that U.S. imperialism is completely defeatable. As for the "peace talks" trick played by U.S. imperialism, it has already been exposed by the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, and its hypocrisy is increasingly apparent.

Currently, the U.S. aggressors are sending large numbers of troops to South Vietnam, launching large-scale military attacks on the liberated areas of South Vietnam, and intensifying the use of B-52 strategic bombers from Thai bases to bomb South Vietnam. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also plotting to carry out even larger-scale bombings of North Vietnam and is attempting to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula, invading Laos and Cambodia. Chairman Mao said: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The mad actions of U.S. imperialism are the last struggles of a cornered beast, and they will absolutely not save it from its inevitable doom.

The U.S. imperialists' evil activities of escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and plotting "peace talks" are fully supported and cooperated with by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique not only plots and schemes for the "peace talks" trick of U.S. imperialism but also works hard to promote the "peace talks" trick of the U.S., attempting to win the favor of U.S. imperialism, strengthen U.S.-Soviet cooperation, and dominate the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has actually become the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism in escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and the chief culprit in sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Soviet revisionists' thorough and complete betrayal has long been despised by the people of the world.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." The Vietnamese people are towering heroes. In the 150,000 square kilometers of South Vietnam, 14 million people have fought against more than 100,000 U.S. and puppet troops, defeating them time and again and achieving one victory after another, creating a miracle in the history of people's liberation wars. The people of North Vietnam have successfully resisted the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing and other acts of aggression. The great victories of the Vietnamese people have exposed the true nature of the U.S. imperialists' paper tiger. The U.S. imperialists have already fallen into the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war. No matter how the U.S. imperialists engage in military blackmail and political deception, and no matter how the Soviet revisionist leadership clique collaborates with the U.S. imperialists in betrayal, they cannot shake the 31 million Vietnamese people's determination to fight to the end. The Vietnamese people will surely remove all obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and achieve final victory in the war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemies of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. The Chinese people are the Vietnamese people's closest comrades-in-arms. China is the Vietnamese people's strongest and most reliable rear base in their resistance against U.S. imperialism. Our people have always steadfastly and wholeheartedly supported the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Currently, our country is undergoing an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the great victory of this revolution will make our country even more consolidated and stronger. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people are determined to bear the greatest national sacrifices, to forever unite with and fight alongside the Vietnamese people, to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, and to never rest until the goal is achieved.

    我外交部就美帝又疯狂轰炸越南海防发表声明
    中国人民愤怒声讨美帝新罪行
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民，决心同越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者
    新华社二十五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部二十五日发表声明，愤怒声讨美帝国主义又一次疯狂地、大规模地轰炸海防市的滔天罪行，重申中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南政府和越南人民的严正立场。声明强调指出，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民，决心准备承担最大的民族牺牲，永远同兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者，不达目的，誓不罢休。
    声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
              一九六七年四月二十五日
    四月二十日，美国强盗飞机在对越南民主共和国领土进行狂轰滥炸的时候，又一次疯狂地、大规模地轰炸了海防市的工业和居民区，使越南人民的生命财产受到重大损失。中国人民愤怒声讨美帝国主义这一滔天罪行。
    四月二十一日，越南民主共和国外交部发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义这一野蛮的战争行动，重申越南人民反对侵略、抗战到底的决心。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南政府和越南人民的这一严正立场。
    美国强盗野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国领土和大规模轰炸海防市，是美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略越南战争的信号。
    大家知道，美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中，虽然投入了四十多万美国侵略军，动用了大部分海、空力量，但是，在越南人民的英勇抗击下，伤亡重大。美帝从去年十月开始的所谓旱季攻势，事实上将以更大的惨败而告结束。这又一次雄辩地说明，南越人民愈战愈强，人民战争威力无比，而美帝国主义是完全可以打败的。至于美帝国主义玩弄的“和谈”骗局，也已被越南人民和世界人民所识破，日益暴露其虚伪性。
    目前，美国侵略者正向南越大量增兵，向南越解放区发动大规模的军事进攻，并且加紧使用从泰国基地起飞的B—52战略轰炸机，轰炸越南南方。与此同时，美帝国主义还在策划对越南北方进行更大规模的轰炸，而且妄图把战争扩大到整个印度支那，侵略老挝和柬埔寨。毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义的这些疯狂行为，都是困兽犹斗的最后挣扎，绝对挽救不了它的失败的必然命运。
    美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争、推行“和谈”阴谋的罪恶活动，是完全得到苏联修正主义领导集团的支持和合作的。苏修领导集团不但为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋出谋划策，而且十分卖力地为美帝“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳，妄图以此来取得美帝国主义的欢心，加强美苏合作，主宰世界。苏修领导集团实际上已成为美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的头号帮凶，破坏越南人民抗美救国斗争的罪魁祸首。苏修这种十足地道的叛卖行径，早已为世界人民所不齿。
    “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”越南人民是顶天立地的英雄。一千四百万越南南方人民在十五万平方公里的土地上，抗击了一百多万美、伪军，把他们打得落花流水，取得了一个又一个的巨大胜利，创造了人类解放战争史上的奇迹。越南北方人民胜利地抗击了美帝国主义的狂轰滥炸和其他侵略行动。越南人民的伟大胜利，戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的本质。美帝国主义已经陷入越南人民战争的汪洋大海之中，不管美帝国主义怎样进行军事讹诈和政治欺骗，不管苏修领导集团怎样配合美帝国主义进行叛卖活动，都动摇不了三千一百万越南人民抗战到底的决心。越南人民必将扫除一切障碍，克服一切困难，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    美帝国主义是中、越两国人民不共戴天的敌人。中国人民是越南人民最亲密的战友。中国是越南人民抗击美帝国主义最坚强和最可靠的大后方。我国人民一贯坚定不移地全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。目前，我国正在进行着一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，必将使我国更加巩固和更加强大。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民，决心准备承担最大的民族牺牲，永远同兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者，不达目的，誓不罢休。
