The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has recently been particularly eager to spread anti-China rumors regarding the Vietnam issue. Their arguments are absurd, and their methods are despicable, reaching an unprecedented level.

These rumor-mongers claim that the Chinese people are "in cahoots" with American imperialism because American imperialism wants to expand its "war in Vietnam," while the Chinese people support the Vietnamese people in waging a "prolonged war." What a bizarre claim! American imperialism is the aggressor, the Vietnamese people are the victims of aggression, and the Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting the American aggressors to the end. How can this possibly make the Chinese people and American imperialism "in cahoots"? This is simply turning black into white. The logic of the Soviet revisionist clique is clear: the Vietnamese people should not resist American imperialist aggression but should lay down their arms; people of all countries should not support the Vietnamese people in resisting American aggression but should pressure the Vietnamese people to surrender to the American aggressors. Look, when the Soviet revisionists are busy slandering the Chinese people, they are actually exposing their own ugly faces!

Even more absurd is their fabrication that China and the United States have reached a "secret agreement." The people of the world can only sneer at such nonsense from the Soviet revisionists. The Chinese people's stance of aiding Vietnam and resisting the U.S. is well-known, and the American imperialists are also fully aware of it. Those who have secretly colluded with and actively cooperated with the American aggressors are precisely the Soviet revisionist traitors themselves. They rack their brains to concoct slanderous rumors against China, but this is merely a case of the thief crying "catch the thief."

Why do the Soviet revisionist traitors spread so many rumors about China regarding the Vietnam issue?

The reason is clear.

Their true face of fake support and real betrayal of the Vietnamese people has been exposed. Therefore, they try to slander China to cover up their own crimes, so they can continue their shameful betrayal activities.

They collude with American imperialism to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, and their plots have repeatedly failed. Therefore, they try to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples to further pressure the Vietnamese people, continuing their schemes of inducement and coercion to surrender.

In a word, the Soviet revisionist traitors' slander of China is to meet the current needs of the American aggressors, serving the great conspiracy of "using war to force peace" that the U.S. imperialists are vigorously promoting.

Facts once again prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

    拙劣的诽谤
    苏联修正主义领导集团近来特别热中于在越南问题上大造反华谣言，其论调之荒唐，手法之卑劣，达到登峰造极的地步。
    这些造谣专家说，中国人民同美帝国主义是“一伙”，因为美帝国主义要扩大“在越南的战争”，而中国人民则支持越南人民“进行‘持久战’”。真是天下奇闻！美帝国主义是侵略者，越南人民是被侵略者，中国人民坚决支持越南人民同美国侵略者打到底，怎么倒同美帝国主义成为“一伙”了呢？这简直是颠倒黑白。苏修集团的逻辑是很清楚的，那就是越南人民根本就不应当抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，而应当放下武器；世界各国人民也根本不应当支持越南人民抗击美国侵略者，而应当对越南人民施加压力，要他们在美国侵略者面前屈膝投降。看，苏修这伙叛徒在起劲地诽谤中国人民的时候，恰恰暴露了他们自己的丑恶嘴脸！
    更荒唐无稽的是，他们还捏造说什么中国同美国达成了“默契”。世界人民对于苏修的这种奇谈，只能嗤之以鼻。中国人民援越抗美的立场，是人所共知的，美帝国主义心里也是明明白白的。同美国侵略者结成一伙，达成默契，而且公开勾结，积极配合的，正是苏修叛徒集团自己。他们挖空心思，编造诽谤中国的谣言，不过是贼喊捉贼而已。
    为什么苏修叛徒集团要在越南问题上大造中国的谣言呢？
    原因是很清楚的。
    他们对越南人民假支持、真出卖的面目，已经被揭穿。于是，他们就企图用诽谤中国的办法来掩饰自己，这样才好继续进行其可耻的叛卖活动。
    他们配合美帝国主义诱迫越南人民屈膝投降的阴谋，不断遭到破产。于是，他们就企图在中越人民之间进行挑拨离间，以便于进一步对越南人民施加压力，大搞其诱降、迫降勾当。
    一句话，苏修叛徒集团大肆诽谤中国，就是为了适应美国侵略者当前的需要，替美帝国主义正在加紧推行的“以战迫和”的大阴谋效劳。
    事实再一次表明，苏修领导集团是美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶。
