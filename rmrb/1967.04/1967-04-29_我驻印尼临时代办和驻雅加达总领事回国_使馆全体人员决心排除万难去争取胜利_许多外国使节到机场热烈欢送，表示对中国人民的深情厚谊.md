	Chinese Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Indonesia Return to China
	All Embassy Staff Resolved to Overcome All Difficulties to Achieve Victory
	Many Foreign Envoys at the Airport to Bid Farewell, Expressing Deep Affection for the Chinese People

	New China News Agency, April 28th: News from Jakarta: China's Chargé d'Affaires in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and Consul General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, departed Jakarta by plane early on the 28th and returned to China.

	On the 24th, Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren were arbitrarily declared "unwelcome persons" by the reactionary Indonesian government and were ordered to leave the country by the 29th. This is a serious step taken by the Indonesian reactionaries to trample on international norms, align with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and willfully sabotage the relationship between the two countries.

	At the Jakarta airport, Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren were warmly seen off by envoys from various countries in Indonesia. They included ambassadors and chargés d'affaires from the embassies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cuba, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Syria, and Algeria in Indonesia. A representative from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam also came to the airport to see them off. Some diplomatic envoys arrived at the airport two hours before the plane's departure. Many envoys repeatedly embraced Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren warmly, expressing their deep affection for the Chinese people.

	Those who came to the airport to see them off also included Chinese diplomatic personnel stationed in Indonesia.

	When Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren left the embassy at 5:30 AM, all embassy staff lined up to cheer them off, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's words: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to achieve victory."

	Before leaving Jakarta, Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren held a farewell reception.

    我驻印尼临时代办和驻雅加达总领事回国
    使馆全体人员决心排除万难去争取胜利
    许多外国使节到机场热烈欢送，表示对中国人民的深情厚谊
    新华社二十八日讯  雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山和驻雅加达总领事徐仁二十八日清晨乘飞机离开雅加达回国。
    姚登山代办和徐仁总领事二十四日被印尼反动政府无理宣布为“不受欢迎的人”，并被限定于二十九日以前离境。这是印尼反动派粗暴地践踏国际关系准则，投靠美帝苏修肆意破坏两国关系的严重步骤。
    姚登山代办和徐仁总领事在雅加达机场受到了各国驻印尼使节的热情欢送。他们是越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、古巴、柬埔寨、阿富汗、叙利亚和阿尔及利亚驻印尼大使馆的大使、代办。越南南方民族解放阵线的代表也到机场送行。有些外交使节在飞机起飞前两小时就到机场。许多使节一再和姚登山和徐仁热情拥抱，表示他们对中国人民的深情厚谊。
    到机场送行的还有中国驻印尼大使馆外交人员。
    在姚登山代办和徐仁总领事清晨五时半离开使馆时，使馆全体人员列队鼓掌欢送，并高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    姚登山代办和徐仁总领事在离开雅加达前夕举行了告别招待会。
