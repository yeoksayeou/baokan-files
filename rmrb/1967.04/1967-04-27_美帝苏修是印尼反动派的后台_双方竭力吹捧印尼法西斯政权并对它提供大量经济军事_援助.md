In recent months, the Soviet revisionist leadership has closely colluded with U.S. imperialism, intensifying their political, economic, and military support for the anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary right-wing fascist regime in Indonesia.

Politically, to support the Suharto reactionary regime in its mad slaughter of the Indonesian revolutionary people and its intensified anti-China policies, the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists have frequently engaged in dirty deals with the Suharto fascist regime, further strengthening their counter-revolutionary "friendly cooperation." The Soviet revisionist leadership has repeatedly stated that it has not changed its attitude towards the Indonesian reactionaries because Suharto has assumed the role of "acting president" and is pursuing "active anti-communism." Instead, it will "strive to further strengthen Indonesia's relations with the Soviet Union." A recent issue of the Soviet magazine *Novoye Vremya* published an article on Indonesia stating that the Indonesian reactionaries' anti-China and anti-communist policies have received the Soviet revisionists' "unwavering support," and that the Soviet revisionists have consistently "defended" the Indonesian reactionaries' "interests" on the international stage. The Soviet revisionist leadership shamelessly sings in tune with U.S. imperialism, openly praising the Indonesian fascist regime, which has its hands stained with the blood of revolutionary people and implements a policy of national betrayal, as an "anti-imperialist" government that pursues a policy of "national independence." They sing praises for the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries.

Economically, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is providing lifeblood to the Indonesian reactionaries, who are on the brink of collapse. Recently, the Soviet revisionists agreed to allow Indonesia to defer the repayment of a massive debt of $120 million and its interest. Recently, the U.S. announced that it would provide the Indonesian reactionaries with a loan of $8 million this year. At the end of last year, after the right-wing military regime in Indonesia announced the so-called "Foreign Investment Law," which sells out national interests, U.S. monopoly capital immediately extended its claws into Indonesia, signing an agreement with the Indonesian reactionaries to obtain privileges for plundering and exploiting Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist leadership recently followed in the footsteps of U.S. imperialism, expressing its intention to invest in Indonesia according to the Indonesian "Foreign Investment Law."

Militarily, the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism continue to provide the Indonesian reactionaries with large amounts of "military aid," arming Indonesia's army, navy, and air force. According to reports, most of the weapons and ammunition for the Indonesian Army are continuously supplied by the Soviet revisionists, with a small portion supplied by the U.S. Recently, the U.S. has decided to prepare to resume "military aid" to Indonesia. Recently, the Soviet revisionist leadership also helped the Indonesian reactionaries complete the "055" military project to equip the navy, including a power plant and a charging station for the navy's use. According to former Indonesian Air Force Commander Herlangga, the Soviet revisionist leadership will also provide Indonesia with modern equipment to arm the Indonesian Air Force according to the purchase agreement between the Soviet government and the Indonesian right-wing military regime, and is also helping the Indonesian reactionaries train air force personnel who can operate this equipment.

There is no doubt that the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists, in order to drive the Suharto right-wing military clique to further brutally suppress the Indonesian revolutionary people and madly oppose China, will closely cooperate to provide the Indonesian fascist regime with more "aid." However, no matter how the U.S. and Soviet revisionists "work together," they cannot save the Indonesian reactionaries, who are in a state of turmoil. No matter how hard the Indonesian reactionaries work for the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, they cannot help the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, who are on the verge of collapse. The revolutionary tide of the Asian and world peoples will sweep these harmful pests into the dustbin of history.

    美帝苏修是印尼反动派的后台
    双方竭力吹捧印尼法西斯政权并对它提供大量经济军事“援助”
    新华社二十四日讯  近几个月来，苏修领导集团同美帝国主义密切勾结，加紧从政治、经济和军事上，全面“援助”反华、反共、反人民、反革命的印尼右派法西斯政权。
    在政治上，为了支持苏哈托反动政权疯狂屠杀印尼革命人民和加紧反华，苏修美帝同苏哈托法西斯政权频繁进行肮脏的交易，进一步加强它们反革命的“友好合作”关系。苏修集团最近再三表示，它并没有因苏哈托担任“代总统”和奉行“积极反共主义”，而对印尼反动派“改变态度”，相反“将致力于进一步密切印尼同苏联的关系”。苏联《新时代》不久前的一期上发表的一篇关于印尼的文章中说，印尼反动派的反华反共政策，都得到苏修“坚定不移的支持”，苏修一贯在国际舞台上“捍卫”印尼反动派的“利益”。苏修领导集团恬不知耻地和美帝国主义唱一个调子，公然把双手沾满革命人民鲜血和实行卖国政策的印尼法西斯政权，吹捧为“反帝国主义”的和实行“民族独立方针”的政府，为印尼反动派的滔天罪行唱赞歌。
    在经济上，苏修领导集团伙同美帝国主义，为朝不保夕的印尼反动派输血。不久前，苏修答应让印尼延期偿还为数达十二亿美元的巨额债款和利息。最近，美帝宣布将在今年内供给印尼反动派八千万美元的贷款。去年年底，印尼右派军人政权宣布出卖民族利益的所谓“外国投资法案”后，美国垄断资本的黑手立即伸进印尼，同印尼反动派签订一项协定，取得了在印尼进行掠夺和剥削的特权。苏修领导集团最近也紧步美帝的后尘，表示将根据印尼的“外国投资法案”在印尼投资。
    在军事上，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义继续给印尼提供大量的“军事援助”，武装印尼的陆、海、空军。据报道，印度尼西亚陆军的武器、弹药大部分是苏修源源不断地供给的，小部分是美国供给的。最近，美国已决定准备恢复对印尼的“军事援助”。最近，苏修领导集团又帮助印尼反动派建成装备海军的“○五五”号军事工程，包括一个供海军使用的发电厂和充电厂。据前印尼空军司令赫兰邦透露，苏修集团还将根据苏联政府与印尼右派军人政权的购买协定，向印尼提供现代设备武装印尼空军，并且还正在帮助印尼反动派训练能够掌握这种设备的空军人员。
    毫无疑问，苏修和美帝为了推动苏哈托右派军人集团进一步血腥镇压印尼革命人民和疯狂反华，还会紧密配合给印尼法西斯政权更多的“援助”。但是，不管美帝和苏修如何“共同努力”，也救不了风雨飘摇中的印尼反动派的命。不管印尼反动派怎样起劲为美帝和苏修效劳，也帮不了日暮途穷的美帝和苏修的忙。亚洲和世界人民革命的洪流，必将把帝修反这些害人虫冲进历史的垃圾堆。
