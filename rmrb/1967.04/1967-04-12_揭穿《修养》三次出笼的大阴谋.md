The book "Cultivation of the Self," meticulously crafted by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, is a thoroughly poisonous weed. This book is purely deceitful, detached from the reality of class struggle, detached from the revolution, detached from political struggle. It avoids discussing the fundamental issue of the revolution, which is the question of power, and it avoids discussing the dictatorship of the proletariat. It propagates idealist cultivation theory, obliquely advocating bourgeois individualism and slave ideology, opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

For over twenty years, whenever the Chinese revolution faced critical moments, the top capitalist-roader in the Party would throw out this book, viciously attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, frenziedly opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the great revolutionary struggle led by the Party.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a mass criticism of this book, thoroughly eliminating its pernicious influence.

"Cultivation of the Self" is a book of surrender leading to the destruction of the Party and the nation.

In July 1939, the top capitalist-roader in the Party delivered a report at the Marx-Lenin Institute in Yan'an, first releasing this poisonous weed, "Cultivation of the Self."

At that time, the Japanese invaders had occupied half of China. Our Party led the people in a heroic war of resistance. However, the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, was actively plotting to split the anti-Japanese national united front, actively opposing the communists, passively resisting Japan, and secretly plotting to surrender to the Japanese invaders. The imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France were actively engaged in the "Munich" conspiracy to force China's surrender. Within the Party, the right-opportunist line of "everything through the united front" and "everything subordinate to the united front," advocated by Wang Ming and his followers, had been severely criticized at the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee, but its influence had not yet been completely eliminated. The dangers of surrender, split, and retreat within the anti-Japanese national united front were growing.

In this critical situation of national crisis and complex class contradictions, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the political slogan of "persisting in resistance, opposing surrender; persisting in unity, opposing split; persisting in progress, opposing retreat," and engaged in a head-on struggle against the Kuomintang's anti-communist and surrender activities. He formulated the correct policy of maintaining "independence and self-reliance" and "unity through struggle" within the united front, and called on the entire Party to mobilize the masses, expand the liberated areas and people's army in Japanese-occupied regions, and shoulder the great historical task of achieving victory in the war of resistance and making the victory of the war of resistance a victory for the people.

However, the "Cultivation of the Self" thrown out by the top capitalist-roader in the Party at this time did not discuss the situation of the revolutionary struggle at all; it did not discuss mobilizing the masses to defeat Japanese imperialism and save the nation from peril; it did not discuss opposing the Kuomintang's anti-communist and surrender plots; it did not discuss the Party's leadership and independent policy within the united front; it did not discuss the principled struggle within the Party against right-opportunist surrenderism. In the 50,000-word "Cultivation of the Self," there was not even a mention of the phrase "resist Japan and save the nation." Instead, he expounded on the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius and on bourgeois cultivation. This is a book of revolutionary surrender, a theory of "cultivation" leading to the destruction of the Party and the nation.

This top capitalist-roader in the Party was not accidental in proposing this theory of surrenderism. As early as 1937, in the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, he openly opposed the workers' anti-Japanese and national salvation movement and prohibited the slogan of "waging a national revolutionary war with arms" and "expelling the Japanese from China." In 1939, he absurdly claimed that "resist Japan and save the nation, defend peace, and oppose imperialism" were "empty" and "monotonous" political slogans. He believed that only those interested in "resisting Japan and saving the nation or sacrificing for the nation" would follow you. Is this not a blatant opposition to using the slogan of "resist Japan and save the nation" to mobilize and organize the masses? Is this not a slander against the broad masses who are unwilling to resist and are willing to be slaves of a fallen nation? This is a great insult to the Chinese people, a great exposure of his nature of surrenderism. The Chinese people are not as he says; the Chinese people have a great tradition of anti-imperialist revolution.

Class surrenderism is actually the reserve force of national surrenderism. The top capitalist-roader in the Party and the right-opportunist Wang Ming are birds of a feather. He colluded with Wang Ming to vigorously propagate and implement the line of class surrenderism. He once boasted that "the Kuomintang is the state," "the words of the Kuomintang are the law," "the Chinese revolution, if it can be carried out under this good banner—the Kuomintang, the Three Principles of the People—we do not know how much advantage we can gain," openly advocating surrender to the Kuomintang and opposing Chairman Mao's correct line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the greatest obstacles to his implementation of the right-opportunist line of surrenderism. Therefore, he used vicious language to brazenly attack Chairman Mao. In "Cultivation of the Self," he insinuated, "Those who claim to be the 'Marx and Lenin of China,' pretending to be Marx and Lenin in the Party, and shamelessly demanding that our Party members respect him as they respect Marx and Lenin, support him as a 'leader,' and repay him with loyalty and enthusiasm." He has always opposed Chairman Mao, and there are many criminal facts to prove it, which he cannot deny.

After the Zunyi Conference in 1935, Chairman Mao had become the recognized great and wise leader of our Party. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party did not acknowledge this at all. In the first half of 1937, in a letter to someone, he viciously attacked, saying, "We still do not have a Stalin of China. Anyone who wants to be Stalin will end up 'drawing a tiger but failing to make it look like a tiger.'" He brazenly shouted, "The Chinese Party must still be led by us. There is no better group." After that, he repeatedly shouted, "The leader and center of the entire Party have not actually formed for a long time." It is clear that this ambitious and scheming plotter has always coveted the highest leadership of the Party.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the great development of the revolution required the rapid expansion of the cadre team and the reform of intellectuals. Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the development of the Party's organization and the conscious cultivation of tens of thousands of cadres to lead the people of the entire nation in the War of Resistance Against Japan; he called on the broad revolutionary intellectuals to go among the workers and peasants, to unite with the workers and peasants, and "to mobilize and organize the 90% of the nation's population who are workers and peasants." Chairman Mao said, "The day the people of the entire nation rise up is the day of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan."

However, this top capitalist-roader in the Party attempted to use "Cultivation of the Self" to oppose Chairman Mao's correct policy. He wanted Communist Party members and revolutionaries to detach themselves from the fiery class struggle, detach themselves from the War of Resistance Against Japan, detach themselves from the workers and peasants, and shut themselves up to engage in so-called "self-cultivation." If "Cultivation of the Self" were followed, the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Chinese revolution would inevitably fail.

"Cultivation of the Self" provides the ideological and theoretical foundation for the development of capitalism in China.

In August 1949, the top capitalist-roader in the Party revised and republished the reactionary "Cultivation of the Self" in large quantities.

At that time, the War of Liberation was about to achieve victory nationwide. The main issue facing the Party and the Chinese people was: after the democratic revolution achieved nationwide victory, where would China go? Would it take the capitalist road or the socialist road? On this fundamental issue, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie engaged in fierce and complex struggles. In this struggle between two classes and two roads, the top capitalist-roader in the Party blatantly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, attempting to establish a bourgeois republic and implement bourgeois dictatorship in China, taking the capitalist road. He once again threw out "Cultivation of the Self" to provide the ideological and theoretical foundation for the development of capitalism in China.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. In his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" published on June 30, 1949, Chairman Mao said, "A bourgeois republic has existed in foreign countries, but China cannot have one because China is a country oppressed by imperialism." Chairman Mao emphasized, "Summing up our experience, it boils down to one point, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat (through the Communist Party) led by the workers, based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This dictatorship must unite with the international revolutionary forces. This is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program." The dictatorship of the proletariat is our lifeline. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything.

In "Cultivation of the Self," however, the top capitalist-roader in the Party did not mention the fundamental issue of the revolution, which is the issue of power, nor did he mention the great struggle of the Chinese people to seize power, nor did he mention the dictatorship of the proletariat. Instead, he deleted the entire section on "developing our thoughts politically" from the 1939 original, intending to further numb the revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members and revolutionary people, divert their attention, make them detach themselves from the real class struggle, detach themselves from the revolution, and detach themselves from political struggle, so that the bourgeoisie could seize the fruits of the people's revolutionary victory. As early as after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously advocated parliamentary democracy, shouting about "not achieving the success of the democratic revolution through civil war, but basically through the constitution, establishing a parliament, and building a parliamentary state." In 1949, when the Chinese people's revolution was about to seize power nationwide, he did not mention the struggle to seize power or the dictatorship of the proletariat, and his malicious intentions were clear.

On the eve of the nationwide revolutionary victory, Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in March 1949 that after the nationwide victory, the fundamental contradiction within the country was "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie," and proposed to "transform China from an agricultural country to an industrial country steadily and build China into a great socialist country." Later, Chairman Mao summed up, saying, "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, where would China go? To capitalism or to socialism? Many people were not clear on this issue. The facts have answered this question: only socialism can save China."

The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, sang a different tune, vigorously advocating the "consolidation of the new democratic order." In a meeting, he even stipulated that Party members should "struggle to consolidate the new democratic system." He shouted about "China not having too much capitalism but too little capitalism," wanting to "partner with the bourgeoisie for ten to fifteen years," and even "allow the capitalists to exist and develop for several decades"; he advocated the "legitimacy of bourgeois exploitation" and the "long-term preservation of the rich peasant economy," advocating the "four freedoms" and the development of capitalist economy in the countryside. He vigorously advocated the development of capitalism, which was actually to make China return to the old road of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism.

In the 1949 edition of "Cultivation of the Self," he made several major revisions. If in the 1939 "Cultivation of the Self" he had to pretend to criticize Li Lisan and Zhang Guotao to insinuate attacks on the great leader of the Party, Chairman Mao, now he boldly went on the offensive, openly deleting the names of Li Lisan and Zhang Guotao, and changing it to "such people have been quite a few in the Communist Party of China, and the worst representatives are even worse than the above situation.... Can we confidently say that there will be no such people in our Party? We cannot say that."

In fact, this top capitalist-roader in the Party never stopped opposing and attacking Chairman Mao. In 1945, the Seventh Congress stipulated that Mao Zedong Thought was the guiding ideology of the Party and the compass for all our work. Chairman Mao's prestige was even higher among the entire Party and the people of the nation. However, after the Seventh Congress, the Chinese Khrushchev became even more brazen in opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to usurp the highest leadership of the Party. In 1947, during the National Land Conference, he openly incited opposition to Chairman Mao, saying, "Chairman Mao can also be opposed," "in the past, the Central Committee has changed many leaders.... In the future, it can be changed even more." In the spring of 1949, in Tianjin, he told the workers, "If it were in the past, could you have seen someone like me? Now in China, I am either number one or number two." He actually regarded himself as the highest leader of the Party. At the same time, he brazenly attacked Chairman Mao, saying, "If it is not the truth, even if it is said by the Communist Party or Mao Zedong, it is wrong."

The top capitalist-roader in the Party viciously attacked our greatest leader and teacher Chairman Mao, once again exposing his wolfish ambition to usurp the Party.

"Cultivation of the Self" is a manifesto for the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao said, "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." In August 1962, the top capitalist-roader in the Party threw out the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self" in large quantities, attempting to create public opinion for the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism.

Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our socialist revolution and socialist construction achieved extremely brilliant victories. Around 1962, due to the sabotage by the Soviet revisionists and three consecutive years of severe natural disasters, our country suffered temporary economic difficulties. International and domestic reactionary forces took the opportunity to launch ferocious attacks on our Party and our socialist system. At this time, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, after secret plotting and careful revision, threw out the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self," which was a manifesto for the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism in China.

Around 1962, the modern revisionists led by the Khrushchev group in the Soviet Union, in collusion with imperialism and reactionaries from various countries, took advantage of our country's temporary economic difficulties to launch anti-China activities. They fiercely attacked our three red banners, maliciously slandering our Party and Chairman Mao as "dogmatism," "sectarianism," "splitism," and so on. For a time, dark clouds rolled in, and evil winds blew. Led by Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee led the people of our country in a resolute struggle against this counter-revolutionary tide, smashing their ferocious attacks time and time again.

However, in the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self," the top capitalist-roader in the Party did not mention a word about opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, but instead, in collusion with the international modern revisionists, fiercely attacked the so-called "dogmatism" and "left-opportunism." In the original edition of "Cultivation of the Self," there was not a word about "dogmatism," but in 1962, it was specially added and fiercely attacked. Obviously, this was in collusion with the reactionary forces internationally to launch a ferocious attack on Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao. The Chinese Khrushchev and the foreign Khrushchev closely colluded, fiercely opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. As Lenin said, "they have all become brothers, they praise each other, learn from each other, and together attack 'dogmatic' Marxism." Chairman Mao pointed out, "The revisionists, the right-opportunists, also hang Marxism on their lips. They also attack 'dogmatism.' But what they attack is the most fundamental thing in Marxism."

The top capitalist-roader in the Party also colluded with Khrushchev to fiercely attack Stalin. He changed the original "to improve oneself in all aspects like Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, to be the best student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin" to "to learn the thoughts and qualities of Marx and Lenin in this way, to be a good student of Marx and Lenin." He adapted to the needs of Khrushchev's revisionism, deleting Stalin's name, attempting to deny that Stalin was a "great Marxist-Leninist," openly opposing Chairman Mao's evaluation of Stalin. Not only that, but the Soviet revisionist group had long betrayed the international proletarian revolutionary cause. He, however, in the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self," vigorously praised the "success of socialist construction in the Soviet Union," "socialism has achieved great victories in one-sixth of the world's land— the Soviet Union."

Chairman Mao taught us: after the basic completion of socialist transformation in terms of ownership, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce." For a small group of reactionaries who harbor hostile attitudes toward our country, "they do not like this proletarian dictatorship of ours; they yearn for the old society. Once they get the chance, they will stir up trouble and try to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China."

In 1962, when the class enemies within the country launched attacks on the Party and socialism time and time again, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, in an early 1962 meeting, took the lead in attacking the three red banners, wanting to summarize the three red banners as "historical experience and lessons." At the same time, he maliciously slandered "abnormal Party life," saying that "Party struggle has gone too far," "Party traditions have been destroyed," and demanding that all "cadres and Party members who were criticized in the past few years" be rehabilitated without distinguishing right from wrong. Under his call and support, the domestic ghosts and snakes, right-opportunists, and rightists launched the "rehabilitation wind" and the "single farming wind," which were rampant for a time. Immediately afterwards, he used the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self" to further viciously attack and slander our Party's struggle against right-opportunism, saying that we "raise every small matter to the so-called 'principled height,' and put political 'opportunism' and other big hats on every small flaw." He slandered our Party, "hard to 'search' for struggle targets, treating certain comrades as 'opportunists,' as 'straw men' in Party struggle." He viciously attacked us for "abusing organizational means and even means of struggle outside the Party to punish comrades, attempting to promote work through these so-called struggle means." This openly provided a "theoretical" basis for the right-opportunists to oppose and attack our Party, attack our socialist cause, and carry out the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism.

With the great victories of our socialist revolution and construction, our most beloved leader and teacher Chairman Mao's prestige in the international arena became higher and higher. As the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out, "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the Party and the nation." In 1960, Comrade Lin Biao called on the entire army to launch a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, setting a brilliant example for the entire Party and the nation. In January 1962, he specially pointed out in response to the revisionist trend within the Party, "Mao Zedong Thought is always the first and decisive factor in any work, it is the soul, it is the lifeline. With it, everything goes smoothly, the banner is clear, and the direction is correct."

To prevent the occurrence of revisionist counter-revolutionary restoration and to prevent the Marxist-Leninist Party from becoming a revisionist Party, Chairman Mao proposed at the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to re-educate cadres and decided to launch a socialist education movement in cities and countryside nationwide. The Party Central Committee believed that arming the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, further promoting the ideological revolution of the people, was the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to make our socialist and communist cause victorious.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party, however, regarded Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest obstacles to his realization of the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism in China. Therefore, in the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self," he even more viciously and maliciously attacked Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He shouted, "Our part is, of course, much smaller than the part of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." He tried to belittle Chairman Mao's great contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause and to Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Lin Biao called on us to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, with ulterior motives, called on us to "faithfully be students of the founders of Marxism-Leninism," and repeated this sentence more than a dozen times in a short section, but did not mention a word about learning from Chairman Mao or learning from Mao Zedong Thought. At a time when the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works was surging throughout the Party, the army, and the nation, he widely circulated the revised edition of "Cultivation of the Self" at home and abroad, selling it everywhere, and mobilized his followers to praise it everywhere. His purpose was to use his revisionist goods to resist and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to lead our broad Party members, cadres, and youth onto the revisionist counter-revolutionary path, overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, restore capitalism in our country, and change the color of our Party and state.

In the history of our Party, there has always been a struggle between two lines. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, at several critical moments in the development of China's revolutionary history, always threw out his "Cultivation of the Self." This is a necessary reflection of the fierce struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. As the number one agent of the bourgeoisie within our Party, he always stubbornly reveals himself, always tries every means to transform our great Party and state according to his reactionary worldview. However, the law of historical development is ruthless. "An ant trying to shake a tree is impossible." The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to reverse the direction of China's history is doomed to fail. We have the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our compass. No enemy, no difficulty can stop our people from carrying the socialist revolution to the end and marching forward bravely towards communism!

    揭穿《修养》三次出笼的大阴谋
    中共中央党校　红旗战斗从、红色联络站、工人革命造反团
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派精心炮制的《修养》是一株彻头彻尾的大毒草。这本书，纯粹是欺人之谈，脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，宣扬唯心主义的修养论，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想。
    二十多年来，每当中国革命的紧要关头，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派就把这本书抛出来，恶毒攻击我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，疯狂反毛泽东思想，反毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和党所领导的伟大革命斗争。
    我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对《修养》这本书展开群众性的批判，彻底肃清它的恶劣影响。
    《修养》是亡党亡国的投降书
    一九三九年七月，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在延安马列学院作报告，首次抛出了《修养》这株大毒草。
    那时，日寇侵占了大半个中国。我党领导全国人民进行着英勇的抗战。而蒋介石国民党正积极酝酿分裂抗日民族统一战线，积极反共，消极抗日，并阴谋投降日寇。美英法帝国主义正在进行胁迫中国投降的东方“慕尼黑”阴谋活动。在党内，以王明为代表的右倾机会主义者所积极推行的“一切经过统一战线”，“一切服从统一战线”的右倾投降主义路线，虽然在党的六届六中全会上遭到严厉的批判，但它的影响还远未肃清。抗日民族统一战线中的投降危险、分裂危险和倒退危险日益发展着。
    在这个民族危机十分严重，阶级矛盾十分复杂的情况下，我们伟大的领袖毛主席提出“坚持抗战，反对投降；坚持团结，反对分裂；坚持进步，反对倒退”的政治口号，同国民党的反共投降活动进行了针锋相对的斗争；制定了在统一战线中坚持“独立自主的原则”和“有团结又有斗争”，“以斗争求团结”的正确方针；号召全党放手发动群众，在日本占领地区扩大解放区和人民军队，肩负起取得抗战胜利，并使抗战的胜利成为人民的胜利这个伟大历史任务。
    而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在这个时候抛出的《修养》，却根本不谈当时革命斗争的形势；根本不谈放手发动群众，打倒日本帝国主义，挽救民族危亡；根本不谈反对国民党反共投降的阴谋活动；根本不谈统一战线中我们党的领导和独立自主的方针；根本不谈党内反对右倾投降主义的原则斗争。在洋洋五万言的《修养》中，甚至连“抗日救国”的字眼都没有。相反，他在《修养》中却大谈孔孟之道，大谈资产阶级的修养。这是反革命的投降书，是亡党亡国的“修养”论。
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，提出这套投降主义的理论，并不是偶然的。早在一九三七年，在国民党统治区职工运动中，他就公然反对工人的抗日救国运动，不准提出“武装进行民族革命战争”、“驱逐日本出中国”的斗争口号。在一九三九年，他胡说什么“抗日救国，保卫和平，反对帝国主义”是“空洞”、“单调”的政治口号。他认为只有那些对“抗日救国或牺牲救国感兴趣的人，才会跟你走”。这不是明目张胆地反对用“抗日救国”的口号去发动民众，组织民众吗？这不是诬蔑广大群众是不愿意抗战的，甘当亡国奴的吗？这是对中国人民的莫大侮辱，是他投降主义本质的大暴露。中国人民决不是他所说的那样，中国人民是有伟大的反帝的革命传统的。
    阶级投降主义实际上是民族投降主义的后备军。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派同右倾投降主义者王明是一丘之貉。他同王明勾结在一起，大肆宣扬和推行阶级投降主义路线。他曾经叫嚣什么“国民党就是国家”，“国民党的话就是法律”，“中国革命，如果能在这个很好的旗帜下——国民党、三民主义——进行，我们不晓得能够讨多少便宜”，公开主张向国民党投降，反对毛主席的正确路线。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是他推行右倾投降主义路线的最大障碍。因此，他用尽了恶毒语言放肆地攻击毛主席。他在《修养》中指桑骂槐地说：“自以为是‘中国的马克思、列宁’，装作马克思、列宁的姿态在党内出现，并且毫不知耻地要求我们的党员照推尊马克思、列宁那样去推尊他，拥护他为‘领袖’，报答他以忠心和热情。”他一贯反对毛主席，有大量罪恶事实可以证明，想赖是赖不掉的。
    一九三五年遵义会议以后，毛主席已是我们党公认的伟大英明的领袖。而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却根本不承认。一九三七年上半年，他在给一个人的信中，恶毒地攻击说：“我们还没有中国的斯大林，任何人想做斯大林，结果都‘画虎不成’。”他猖狂地叫嚣，“中国党还是要由我们这些人来领导，没有另外一批更好的人”。在此以后，他还多次叫嚷：“全党的领袖与中心，很久没有实际的形成”。可见这个野心家、阴谋家一贯觊觎党的最高领导权。
    在抗日战争时期，革命的大发展，要求迅速扩大干部队伍，改造知识分子。毛主席再三强调发展党的组织，自觉地造就成千成万的干部，领导全国人民抗日战争；号召广大革命知识分子到工农民众中去，同工农民众相结合，“把占全国人口百分之九十的工农大众，动员起来，组织起来”。毛主席说：“全国民众奋起之日，就是抗日战争胜利之时”。
    可是，这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却妄图用《修养》来反对毛主席的正确方针。他要共产党员和革命者，脱离火热的阶级斗争，脱离抗日战争，脱离工农群众，关起门来进行所谓“自我修养”。如果按照《修养》做下去，抗日战争和中国革命必然遭到失败。
    《修养》为在中国发展资本主义提供思想理论基础
    一九四九年八月，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派把反动的《修养》校阅修订，大量出版。
    当时，解放战争即将取得全国胜利，摆在党和中国人民面前的主要问题是，在民主革命取得全国胜利后，中国究竟往那里去？是走资本主义道路还是走社会主义道路？在这个根本问题上，无产阶级和资产阶级展开了激烈的、复杂的斗争。在这场两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，明目张胆地站在资产阶级反动立场上，妄图建立资产阶级共和国，在中国实行资产阶级专政，走资本主义道路。他再一次抛出《修养》，就是为在中国发展资本主义提供思想理论基础。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。毛主席在一九四九年六月三十日发表的《论人民民主专政》一文中说：“资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。”毛主席着重地指出：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这个专政必须和国际革命力量团结一致。这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。”无产阶级专政的政权是我们的命根子，有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》中，却闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈中国人民夺取政权的伟大斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政，反而把一九三九年原版中“在政治上开展我们的思想”一节全部删去，就是要更加麻痹共产党员和革命人民的革命斗志，转移他们的视线，使他们脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，以便让资产阶级窃取人民革命的胜利果实。他早在抗日战争胜利以后，就极力鼓吹议会民主，叫嚷什么“不再经过内战达到民主革命成功，基本成功是通过宪法，成立议会，建立议会制国家”。在一九四九年中国人民革命即将夺得全国政权的时候，他闭口不谈夺取政权的斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政，其恶毒用心昭然若揭。
    全国革命胜利前夕，毛主席在一九四九年三月党的七届二中全会上指出，在全国胜利后，国内的基本矛盾是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”，并提出“使中国稳步地由农业国转变为工业国，把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家”。后来，毛主席总结说：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？有许多人在这个问题上的思想是不清楚的。事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却大唱反调，极力宣扬“巩固新民主主义秩序”。在一次会议上，他竟然规定党员要“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”。他叫嚣什么“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了”，要与资产阶级“搭伙十年到十五年”，甚至“还让资本家存在和发展几十年”；宣扬资产阶级“剥削有功”、“剥削合法”；鼓吹“长期保存富农经济”，提倡“四大自由”，发展农村资本主义经济。他竭力主张发展资本主义，其实就是要中国再回到半殖民地半封建的老路。
    他在一九四九年出版的《修养》中，作了若干重大的修改。如果说他在一九三九年的《修养》中还不得不假意装作批判李立三、张国焘以影射攻击党的伟大领袖毛主席，这时他就索性赤膊上阵，公然删去了李立三、张国焘的名字，改成“这种人在中国共产党内曾是不少的，其中最坏的代表比上述情形更坏。……我们是否能够完全自信的说，在我们党内就完全不会有这种人了呢？我们还不能这样说的”。
    事实上，这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派从来没有停止过反对和攻击毛主席。一九四五年党的“七大”规定了毛泽东思想是党的指导思想，是我们一切工作的指针。毛主席在全党和全国人民中威望更高了。而中国的赫鲁晓夫在“七大”以后却更加猖狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，妄图篡夺党的最高领导权。一九四七年他在全国土地会议期间公开煽动反对毛主席。他说：“毛主席也可以反”，“过去中央换了多少负责人……以后更可以换”。一九四九年春，他在天津对工人说：“要在过去，你们能见到我这样的人吗？我现在在中国不数一就数二。”他居然以党的最高领袖自居。同时，他还猖狂攻击毛主席说：“如果不是真理，即使是共产党、毛泽东说的，也是错误的。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派如此恶毒地攻击我们最伟大的领袖和导师毛主席，这就再一次赤裸裸地暴露了他篡党的狼子野心。
    《修养》是资本主义反革命复辟的宣言书
    毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在一九六二年八月第三次大量抛出再版《修养》，就是妄图为资本主义复辟制造舆论。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得了极其辉煌的胜利。一九六二年前后，由于苏联修正主义者的破坏和连续三年的严重自然灾害，我国遭受了暂时的经济困难。国际国内的反动势力乘机向我党和我国的社会主义制度发动了猖狂进攻。就在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，经过密谋策划，精心修改，抛出了再版的《修养》，这是阴谋在中国实行资本主义反革命复辟的宣言书。
    一九六二年前后，以苏联赫鲁晓夫集团为代表的现代修正主义者，伙同帝国主义、各国反动派，利用我国暂时的经济困难，大搞反华活动。他们疯狂攻击我们的三面红旗，恶毒诬蔑我们党和毛主席是“教条主义”、“宗派主义”、“分裂主义”等等。一时黑云滚滚，妖风四起。以毛主席为首的党中央领导我国人民，同这股反革命逆流进行了坚决的斗争，粉碎了他们一次又一次的疯狂进攻。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在再版《修养》中，却通篇只字不提反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，反而配合国际现代修正主义者大肆攻击所谓“教条主义”、“左倾机会主义”。在初版《修养》中根本没有“教条主义”的字样，一九六二年却特意加上而大反特反。显然，这是配合国际上的反动势力，对毛泽东思想和毛主席的猖狂进攻。中国的赫鲁晓夫同外国的赫鲁晓夫紧密配合，疯狂反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，他们正如列宁所说的，“都成了一家弟兄，他们彼此称赞，彼此学习，大家一起攻击‘教条式的’马克思主义”。毛主席指出：“修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，还配合赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林。他把初版《修养》中的“要在各方面去提高自己的品质如象马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林那样，作马、恩、列、斯最好的学生之一”，改为“要这样去学习马克思和列宁的思想和品质，作马克思和列宁的好学生”。他适应赫鲁晓夫修正主义的需要，把斯大林的名字删去，妄图否定斯大林是“伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，公开同毛主席对斯大林的评价唱对台戏。不仅如此，苏联修正主义集团早已背叛国际无产阶级革命事业，他却在再版《修养》中，大肆吹捧“苏联社会主义建设的成功”，“社会主义已经在世界六分之一的地面上——苏联获得了伟大的胜利”。
    毛主席教导我们：社会主义改造在所有制方面基本完成后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的一小撮反动分子，“不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”
    一九六二年，当国内的阶级敌人一次又一次地向党向社会主义发动进攻时，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在一九六二年初一次会议上，带头攻击三面红旗，要把三面红旗当作“历史经验教训”来总结。同时，他又肆意诬蔑“党内生活不正常”，胡说什么“党内斗争过火”、“党的传统遭到破坏”，要求不分是非曲直地为所有“前几年受到批判的干部和党员”进行平反。在他的号召和支持下，国内的牛鬼蛇神、右倾机会主义分子和右派分子掀起了“翻案风”和“单干风”，嚣张一时。紧接着，他通过再版《修养》，进一步恶毒地攻击和诬蔑我们党反对右倾机会主义的斗争，胡说我们“把什么小事都提到所谓‘原则的高度’，对什么小缺点也要加上政治的‘机会主义’等大帽子”。诬蔑我们党，“硬要去‘搜索’斗争对象，把某些同志当作‘机会主义者’，作为党内斗争中射击的‘草人’”。恶毒攻击我们“滥用组织手段甚至党外斗争的手段来惩罚同志，企图靠这种所谓斗争手段来推动工作”。这就公开为右倾机会主义分子反对和攻击我们党，攻击我们社会主义事业，大搞资本主义反革命复辟，提供了“理论”根据。
    随着我国社会主义革命和建设的伟大胜利，我们最最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席在国际上的威望越来越高。正如党的八届十一中全会公报所指出：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党、全国一切工作的指导方针。”一九六○年，林彪同志号召全军开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。他在一九六二年一月又特意针对党内的修正主义思潮指出：“毛泽东思想是在任何工作中永远是第一位的，是起决定作用的，是灵魂，是命根子。有了它就一通百通，旗帜鲜明，方向正确。”
    为了避免出现修正主义的反革命复辟，避免使马列主义的党变为修正主义的党，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上提出了重新教育干部，决定在全国城乡开展社会主义教育运动。党中央认为，用毛泽东思想武装工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部，进一步促进人的思想革命化，这是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，使我们的社会主义和共产主义事业取得胜利的最可靠最根本的保证。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，则把毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想视作他在中国实现资本主义复辟的最大障碍。因此，他在再版的《修养》中更加阴险恶毒地攻击毛主席和毛泽东思想。他大喊大叫：“我们的这一部分，比马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的那一部分，当然是小得多”。他极力贬低毛主席对无产阶级革命事业、对马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献。林彪同志号召我们“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派则别有用心地号召“要忠实地做马克思列宁主义创始人的学生”，并且把这句话在短短一节中重复十几次之多，却绝口不提一句要学习毛主席、学习毛泽东思想。正当全党全军全国人民大学毛主席著作的群众运动日益高涨的时候，他把再版《修养》在国内外大量发行，到处兜售，并发动其党羽四处吹捧，其目的就是要用他的修正主义黑货，抵制和反对毛泽东思想，企图把我们的广大党员、干部和青年引上反革命修正主义的歧途，颠覆我国的无产阶级专政，使资本主义在我国复辟，使我们的党和国家变颜色。
    在我们党的历史上，始终是存在着两条路线斗争的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在我国革命历史发展的几次重大关键时刻，都要抛出他的《修养》，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的必然反映。他作为资产阶级在我们党内的头号代理人，总是要顽强表现自己，总是要千方百计地按照自己的反动世界观改造我们伟大的党和国家。然而，社会历史发展规律是无情的。“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图扭转中国历史的方向，是根本办不到的。我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作方向盘，任何敌人，任何困难都阻挡不了我国人民把社会主义革命进行到底，向共产主义奋勇前进！
