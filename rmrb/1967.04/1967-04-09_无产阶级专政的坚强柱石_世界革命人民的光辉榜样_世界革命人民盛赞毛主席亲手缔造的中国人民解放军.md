The People's Liberation Army, personally created by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a proletarian revolutionary army that serves the entire Chinese people and all the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. It is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. It bears the great responsibility of defending national defense and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is not only loved and supported by all the people of China but also by all the revolutionary people of the world. It is not only a model for all sectors of society in China to learn from but also hailed by the revolutionary people of the world as a "shining example for the people of the world to learn from."

Comrades, friends, and fellow fighters from all over the world, after visiting and touring the units stationed in Beijing and other places, they all expressed their most fervent and sincere feelings, highly praising the People's Liberation Army created by our great leader Chairman Mao for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's military line, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the "four firsts," and promoting the "three-eight" style in a series of major constructions. They said that after the visit, they were deeply impressed, received great education and inspiration, and strengthened their confidence in struggle. They enthusiastically shouted in various languages over and over again: "Long live Mao Zedong, the Marx of our time, the Lenin of our time! Long live, long live, long live the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

Serving the People Wholeheartedly

Comrade Hito Chako, the Political Department Director of the Albanian People's Army, who is on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, said after visiting a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army from the people, an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, the newest and strongest army of the world proletariat, an army with a high sense of internationalism, determined to carry the cause of socialism and communism to the end."

Many foreign friends felt that Chairman Mao's army is great and respectable, a true people's army, after visiting and touring the units. A friend from Madagascar said: "The people's army of China is different from the armies of other countries because it serves the people, while the armies of Western countries enslave the people; the people's army of China is for the people, while the armies of the West are against the people." A teacher from Laos said: "Your army is truly a people's army. Leaders and soldiers are closely united, eating together, living together, studying together, and training together. Only Mao's army can do this!" A friend from Nepal said: "Your relationship between the army and the people is very good. The people not only do not fear the Liberation Army but also have a deep respect and love for the Liberation Army from the heart, and are very willing to get close to the Liberation Army. The relationship between the people and the army is truly like fish and water."

Many foreign friends repeatedly expressed their determination to learn from the Liberation Army after visiting and touring. Chilean expert Palacios said excitedly: "I think not only all the people of China should learn from the Liberation Army, but all the people of the world should also learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, because the Liberation Army is a politically highly educated army, an army that no other country's army can compare with."

Absolutely Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought

Foreign friends felt most deeply during their visits and tours of the units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: the People's Liberation Army is completely an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a truly revolutionary army that is absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

A friend from Thailand said: "I have heard about the heroic deeds of the Liberation Army in naval battles before, especially admiring their tough skills. But I didn't know how the tough skills came from. This time I saw with my own eyes that the cadres and soldiers take Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding ideology, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, and get rid of selfish and impure thoughts, so they don't tremble or panic when fighting."

A friend from Colombia pointed out: "The first impression I got from the visit is that I understood what a new-type army is and how the soldiers emphasize politics. Even the simplest shooting is guided by Mao Zedong Thought." When foreign friends saw that the military camp was full of Chairman Mao's quotations, and before meetings, meals, and sleep, they were studying Chairman Mao's quotations, and everything was guided by Chairman Mao's teachings, they unanimously praised: "This is a political camp, full of politics everywhere."

Many foreign comrades and friends participated in the cadres and soldiers' study and application of Chairman Mao's works during their visits and tours of the units. The cadres and soldiers used Mao Zedong Thought to change their worldview, thoroughly eliminated selfishness and established the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, which left a very deep impression on them. The comrades of the Albanian Military Delegation, after hearing a battalion commander's story of studying and applying the "Three Articles" to fight against his special privileges, living and working with the soldiers, washing the soldiers' clothes, and always insisting on being an ordinary soldier, praised: "We have received great education from your example of fighting with Mao Zedong Thought. We will learn from you." A friend from Japan said after participating in the cadres and soldiers' study and application meeting: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a red army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that eliminates selfishness and establishes public-mindedness. Such an army hates the enemy the most and loves the people the most, and is invincible in the world." Many foreign friends were particularly moved when they saw the soldiers hanging their shortcomings and related quotations of Chairman Mao on cards above their beds, reviewing and "playing back" their thoughts every day, and constantly changing their thoughts. New Zealand Communist Party member Casey said after visiting and touring and listening to the study and application meeting: "I have learned a lot from the soldiers of the Liberation Army." An African friend said after the visit: "I have heard a message that China has the latest weapons. Today I saw that the latest and best weapon of China is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

A Great School of Mao Zedong Thought

Foreign friends were also deeply moved by the fact that the People's Liberation Army is a true great school of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and educate people. They said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a strong collective, with each person melted into this collective. It is a furnace for forging revolutionaries and a school for tempering revolutionaries.

Once, when foreign friends were visiting, they saw soldiers cutting rice, which immediately caused a strong reaction. A friend from Brazil said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is an invincible fighting team and also a production team and a mass work team that insists on self-reliance." Many foreign friends were deeply moved when they had lunch with the soldiers and heard that the rice and vegetables they ate were grown by the soldiers themselves, and the meat was from pigs raised by the soldiers.

When foreign friends heard that the People's Liberation Army has a batch of soldiers demobilized and transferred every year, and at the same time, a batch of young people enlist, an Argentine expert said: "The Liberation Army is like a school, cultivating and tempering a large number of young people. Once the war needs, they will immediately form an invincible army corps and march to the front line." A friend from Venezuela said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the most vivid embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought. It is the vanguard of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and also a great school for changing thoughts."

Through the visits and tours, foreign friends deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, the most loyal to the proletariat, and the most loyal to the revolution and the people. They praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army as the most capable fighters in learning, implementing, spreading, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and the pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Foreign friends expressed: With the leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese people will surely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and achieve the greatest victory.

Fully Supporting the Struggles of the People of All Countries

Foreign friends also used the most enthusiastic language to highly praise the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible and unrivaled in the world.

A friend from Palestine said: "The Chinese army is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and is invincible by any force. No matter how many troops the United States sends or what weapons it uses, it will not be able to win. China is the hope of the world revolution."

Friends from various countries felt great admiration when they visited and saw that the Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly supports the fighting brothers of Vietnam with proletarian internationalism. A friend from Cambodia said: "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are firmly supporting the Vietnamese people and all oppressed peoples in the world." A Vietnamese student studying in Beijing University wrote in a letter of thanks to the unit after visiting the troops: "In the current struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have received the full support of the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is a reliable guarantee for the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors. Through this visit and study, we have further understood the close friendship between the two peoples of Vietnam and China, and the sincere support of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. We are proud to have such brothers and comrades as the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army." A comrade from South Vietnam, who is currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle with American imperialism, said: "In the current struggle against American aggression for national salvation, having the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as our strong rear support, has further strengthened our confidence in defeating American imperialism."

Foreign friends unanimously praised: The People's Liberation Army is not only the strong defender of the Chinese people and the Chinese revolution but also the strong pillar of the world's people and the world revolution. They saw that China has such an invincible army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and they were more confident in the victory of the revolution. Friends from the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe, who came to visit China from the front line of the struggle against American imperialist aggression, said: "Such a strong army is invincible. Seeing the strong Chinese People's Liberation Army, our determination to defeat the American imperialists and their running dogs is even greater." An Indonesian friend pointed out: "Through this visit, I am more convinced that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is invincible by any force. If we add the militia all over the country, then there is no need to say more." Some foreign friends pointed out after the visit that we completely believe that no matter where the American imperialists come from, from the sky, from the sea, from the land, during the day or at night, the Chinese people will surely annihilate them completely.

Revolution Needs a Revolutionary Army

Many foreign friends, after visiting the units, believed: "Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse guiding the revolutionary people of the world forward. To make a revolution, we must have a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

A friend from Ecuador said: "This visit has filled us with confidence in the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse guiding the revolutionary people of the world forward. The revolutionary people of the world are all looking at China, looking at Comrade Mao Zedong, looking at the Chinese People's Liberation Army, looking at the luminous lighthouse of Mao Zedong Thought."

A friend from Thailand said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism. Any country's revolution that departs from Mao Zedong Thought will suffer setbacks and failures." A friend from Venezuela said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Modern revisionists are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, so they attack and slander it in every way. We must learn Mao Zedong Thought and carry the revolution of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the end."

Revolutionaries from the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions, through the visits, have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's wise judgment that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," which is a great truth that will never be overturned. They all expressed: We also want to build a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. A friend from South Africa said: "In the past, in South Africa, the people who held guns were white colonizers. They held weapons in their hands to suppress us. Chairman Mao said: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' which is a great truth. We are now exactly following Chairman Mao's words, picking up the gun, for the liberation of our country, fighting against the colonialists." A friend from Southeast Asia said: "We want to build our own army and also emphasize politics, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Only a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, like the Chinese People's Liberation Army, can truly become the pillar of defending the people. With such an army, all the tricks of the enemy will not work. Our army must learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army." A friend from Africa pointed out: "The revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America want to be liberated, they should study Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings every day and implement them in practical actions. We must apply these precious experiences to our troops."

    无产阶级专政的坚强柱石　世界革命人民的光辉榜样
    世界革命人民盛赞毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军
    新华社八日讯　我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，是一支全心全意为全中国人民，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族服务的无产阶级革命军队。它无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。它是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。它担负着保卫国防和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大任务。它不仅受到全中国人民的拥护和爱戴，而且受到全世界革命人民的拥护和爱戴。它不仅是我国各行各业学习的榜样，而且也被全世界革命人民誉为“世界人民学习的光辉榜样”。
    来自世界各地的同志、战友和朋友们，在参观和访问了驻北京部队某部和驻其他地方的部队以后，都满怀最热烈、最真挚的感情，盛赞我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线，突出无产阶级政治，坚持“四个第一”，大兴三八作风等一系列的重大建设。他们说，参观后留下了深刻的印象，受到了很大的教育和鼓舞，增强了斗争胜利的信心。他们热情地用各种语言一遍又一遍地高呼：“当代的马克思、当代的列宁——毛泽东万岁！”“全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    全心全意为人民服务
    来自反帝反修最前哨的战友阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科同志在参观了中国人民解放军某部后说：“中国人民解放军是用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大军队，是来自人民的军队，是全心全意为人民服务的军队，是全世界无产阶级最新型、最强大的军队，是有高度国际主义精神、决心把社会主义和共产主义事业进行到底的军队。”
    许多外国朋友在部队参观访问时，感到毛主席的军队伟大、可敬，是真正人民的军队。一位来自马尔加什的朋友说：“中国的人民军队所以不同于其他国家的军队，在于它是服务于人民，而西方国家的军队，是奴役人民的；中国的人民军队是为了人民，而西方的军队是反对人民的。”老挝一位教师说：“你们的军队真正是人民的军队。首长和战士亲密团结，大家吃在一起，住在一起，学习在一起，训练在一起，这只有毛主席的军队才能做到！”尼泊尔一位朋友说：“你们解放军和人民之间的关系搞得很好。人民不仅不怕解放军，反而从心里对解放军有一种敬仰、热爱的心情，很愿意同解放军接近，人民和军队真正是鱼水一样的关系。”
    许多外国朋友在参观访问后一再表示，一定要向解放军学习。智利专家帕拉西奥斯激动地说：“我认为，不仅全中国人民要向解放军学习，世界上所有国家的人民也都应该向中国人民解放军学习，因为解放军是一支政治素养很高的军队，是世界上任何国家的军队所不能比拟的。”
    无限忠于毛泽东思想
    外国朋友们在参观访问中国人民解放军部队时，感受最深的一点是：人民解放军完全是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，是一支无限忠于毛泽东思想的真正革命的军队。
    泰国一位朋友说：“以前听说一些关于解放军在海战中的英雄事迹，特别羡慕他们的技术过得硬。但是，不知道过硬的技术是怎么来的。这回亲眼看到指战员们事事以毛泽东思想为指导思想，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，去掉私心杂念，所以打起仗来，手不发抖，心不跳。”哥伦比亚一位朋友指出：“参观中第一个印象是使我懂得了什么是新型的军队，懂得战士们是怎么突出政治的，连一个最简单的射击都是用毛泽东思想来指导的。”当外国朋友们看到军营到处是毛主席语录牌，会前、饭前、睡前都在学习毛主席语录，一切以毛主席的教导为行动准则的情况以后，一致赞扬说：“这是一个政治军营，到处充满着政治”。
    许多外国同志和朋友到部队参观访问时，参加了指战员们活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。解放军指战员用毛泽东思想改造世界观，彻底破私立公，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，使他们得到极为深刻的印象。阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团的同志在听了一位营长活学活用“老三篇”，改造自己特殊化思想，和战士们同吃、同住、同劳动、给战士洗衣服、始终坚持当普通一兵的事迹以后，纷纷赞扬说：“我们从你这样用毛泽东思想去斗争的事例中，受到很大教育，我们要向你学习。”日本一位朋友在参加指战员们的讲用会以后说：“中国人民解放军是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色军队，是一支破私立公的军队，这样的军队最憎恨敌人，最热爱人民，是天下无敌的。”许多外国朋友在战士宿舍里看到战士们把自己的缺点和毛主席的有关语录写在挂在床头的牌子上，天天对照、天天“过电影”，天天改造思想，特别感动。新西兰共产党凯西同志在参观访问和听了讲用会后表示：“我从解放军战士身上学到了不少东西。”一位非洲朋友参观后说：
  “我曾听到一种消息，说中国有了最新式的武器。今天我看到了，中国最新式、最好的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
    毛泽东思想的大学校
    外国朋友对人民解放军是一所真正的毛泽东思想的大学校，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，用毛泽东思想培养人、教育人，也深受感动。他们说，中国人民解放军是一个坚强的集体，每个人都熔化在这个集体中。它是造就革命者的熔炉，是锻炼革命者的学校。
    有一次，外国朋友们参观时，亲眼看到战士在割稻子，立刻引起了强烈的反响。一位巴西朋友说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，是一支战无不胜的战斗队，也是一支坚持自力更生的生产队和群众工作队。”许多外国朋友在和战士们共进午餐时，听说所吃的大米、蔬菜是战士们自己种的，吃的肉是战士们自己养的猪，都十分感动。
    当外国朋友听说人民解放军每年都有一批战士复员转业，同时又有一批青年入伍时，一位阿根廷专家说：“解放军真象一所学校，培养锻炼了大批青年，一旦战争需要，他们马上就会组成不可战胜的兵团开赴前线。”委内瑞拉一位朋友说：“中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想最活的体现，它是中国人民反对帝国主义的先锋队，也是改造思想的大学校。”
    通过参观访问，外国朋友们深刻地体会到：毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，最忠于毛泽东思想，最忠于无产阶级，最忠于革命和人民。他们盛赞中国人民解放军是学习、贯彻、传播和捍卫毛泽东思想最得力的战士，是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的坚强柱石。
    外国朋友们纷纷表示：有当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的领导，有中国人民解放军这个坚强的无产阶级专政的柱石，中国人民一定能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定能够取得最伟大的胜利。
    全力支持各国人民斗争
    外国朋友们还以最热烈的语言盛赞毛泽东思想威力无穷，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军是不可战胜的，是无敌于天下的。
    巴勒斯坦一位朋友说：“中国军队是用毛泽东思想武装的，是任何力量也不能战胜的。美国派多少军队或用什么武器，都不可能取胜。中国是世界革命的希望所在。”
    各国朋友参观时，对中国人民解放军以无产阶级国际主义的精神坚决支持战斗的越南兄弟，感到万分的钦佩。柬埔寨一位朋友说：“中国人民和中国人民解放军是坚决支持越南人民和世界上一切被压迫人民的。”在北京大学的一位越南留学生参观部队后给部队的感谢信上写道：“越南人民在当前的抗美救国斗争中，得到伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军的全力支持，这是越南人民战胜美国侵略者的可靠保证。”“通过这次参观学习，我们更进一步了解到越中两国人民的亲密友谊，和中国人民、中国人民解放军对越南人民抗美救国斗争的诚挚的支持，……我们为有中国人民、中国人民解放军这样的兄弟、同志而感到自豪。”正在同美帝国主义进行殊死搏斗的一位越南南方战友说：“越南人民在当前的抗美救国斗争中，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军做我们的坚强后盾，更增强了我们战胜美帝国主义的信心。”
    外国朋友们一致赞扬说：人民解放军不但是中国人民和中国革命的坚强保卫者，也是全世界人民和世界革命的坚强支柱。他们看到中国有这样一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的无敌于天下的军队，对革命的胜利更加充满了信心。从反对美帝国主义侵略斗争前线来到我国访问的老挝爱国战线党文工团的战友们说：“这样过硬的部队是战无不胜的，看到中国人民解放军这样强大，我们打倒美帝及其走狗的决心就更大了。”一位印度尼西亚朋友指出：“通过这次参观，使我更加确信，在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国人民解放军，是任何力量也不能战胜的。如果再加上全国遍地的民兵，那就更不用说了。”有些外国朋友在参观后指出，我们完全相信，美帝国主义不管从什么地方来，从天上来，从海上来，从陆上来，白天来，黑夜来，中国人民一定能彻底消灭他们。
    要革命就要有革命的军队
    许多外国朋友在到部队参观后认为：“毛泽东思想是照耀全世界革命人民前进的灯塔。”“要革命，就必须有一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命军队”。
    厄瓜多尔一位朋友说：“这次参观，使我们对世界革命充满了信心。……毛泽东思想是照耀全世界革命人民前进的灯塔”，“世界革命人民都在看着中国，看着毛泽东同志，看着中国人民解放军，看着毛泽东思想的光辉灯塔。”
    一位泰国朋友说：“毛泽东思想是最高水平的马列主义，哪个国家的革命离开了毛泽东思想，就要遭受挫折和失败。”一位委内瑞拉朋友说：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，现代修正主义者最害怕毛泽东思想，因此百般地进行攻击、诬蔑。我们要学习毛泽东思想，把亚非拉革命进行到底。”
    来自亚非拉地区的革命者，通过参观，更加深刻地认识到毛主席说的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一英明论断，是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。他们纷纷表示：我们也要建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命军队。一位来自南非的朋友说：“过去在南非看到的拿枪的人，是白人殖民者。他们把武装掌握在手里，镇压我们。毛主席说：‘枪杆子里面出政权’，这是一个伟大的真理。我们现在也正是按着毛主席说的，拿起枪杆子，为解放我们的国家，同殖民主义者进行战斗。”
    来自东南亚的一位朋友说：“我们要建设自己的军队，也要突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。只有象中国人民解放军那样用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命军队，才能真正成为保卫人民的支柱。有了这样的军队，敌人的一切明枪暗箭都不能得逞。我们的军队一定要向中国人民解放军学习。”一位来自非洲的朋友指出：“亚非拉革命人民要想获得解放，就应该带着深厚的阶级感情天天学习毛主席著作，并要贯彻到实际行动中去。我们一定要把这些宝贵的经验用到我们部队中去。”
