The new Indian government, backed by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique, has been in power for a month. Calculating the reactionary deeds it has committed in this short period, one can see that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are using this reactionary government to further control India, enslave the Indian people, and turn India into a crucial link in the anti-China encirclement.

To deal with the growing resistance of the people and maintain its increasingly unstable rule, the new Indian government has sold out India's national interests in politics, economics, and military affairs to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. It has taken bigger steps to align with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

Politically, as soon as the new government took office, it intensified its anti-China stance, shouting about "reclaiming lost territory," interfering in China's internal affairs, and attempting to help Tibetan serf owners stage a comeback. At the same time, it colluded with UN Secretary-General U Thant to plot new conspiracies to push forward the "peace talks" charade, aiming to cover up the crimes of its American masters in expanding the Vietnam War.

Of particular note is that an affiliate organization of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency held a conference in India, with the Indian Vice President delivering the opening speech and a high-ranking Indian official serving as the conference chair. CIA personnel have infiltrated various departments in India, and the U.S. intelligence system and the Indian intelligence system have essentially merged.

Economically, as soon as the new Indian government took office, it announced its agreement to U.S. demands, opening the doors to allow American monopolists to flood into India, monopolizing the most profitable fertilizer industry and ruthlessly exploiting the Indian working people. Thus, the scheme of American monopolistic capital to infiltrate and control India's industrial sectors has further materialized.

Militarily, the Indian reactionary government, following the dictates of U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, disregarding the lives of the people, is frantically expanding its military and preparing for war, drafting a massive military budget (approximately one-third of total expenditures), turning India into a massive anti-China military base. Recently, the Indian reactionary government, under the pretext of dealing with the so-called "nuclear threat" from China, has demanded "nuclear protection" from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. In reality, it is openly forming a military alliance with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, attempting to use the nuclear weapons of these two nuclear bullies to intimidate China and other neighboring countries.

In just one month, the Indian reactionary government has committed so many evil deeds of pro-U.S., pro-Soviet, anti-China, and anti-people. The U.S. imperialist boss praised the Indian lackey for his hard work and immediately rewarded him with a large sum of money and grain. Recently, the "aid-to-India consortium" composed of the U.S. and others announced that it would provide India with 10 million tons of grain this year and agreed to provide approximately $1.3 billion (including grain) in new "aid." The Soviet revisionist boss was also satisfied, enthusiastically praising and boosting the status of the Indian reactionary government. In recent days, the Soviet revisionists, taking advantage of the 20th anniversary of Sino-Indian relations, have been loudly promoting the "Sino-Indian cooperation" quackery, boosting the morale of the new Indian government.

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have long had their plans. To encircle China, the U.S. imperialists have made large-scale military deployments from Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, South Vietnam to Thailand, establishing many military bases, forming a semi-encirclement in China's east and south. The Soviet revisionists have also established a semi-encirclement in China's west and north. The two are partnering to turn India into their military base, linking the two semi-circles into a complete anti-China encirclement.

The important position that India occupies in the anti-China strategy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists makes them willing to spend a great deal of money and effort to suppress, control, and enslave its vast population. However, as the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The brutal suppression, frantic attacks, and bribery and deception of the revolutionary masses by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries cannot save them from their doom, but will instead further promote the revolutionary awakening of the people of various countries."

Since last year, the Indian people's violent resistance against tyranny has been developing. The one-party reactionary rule of the Indian National Congress has become increasingly unstable. After the February elections, it lost control of the state governments in half of the states. In some states, there have been repeated incidents of angry crowds looting grain and weapons. The Nagas and Mizos, who have been persistently engaged in armed struggle, continue to strike at the Indian reactionary army in the deep mountains and forests. The entire country of India is filled with tinder and fire. No matter how large-scale the fascist terrorist actions the Indian reactionaries may take, the Indian people's resistance will never be extinguished or suppressed.

The struggle of the Indian revolutionary people will definitely be victorious. A truly independent and democratic new India will definitely emerge.

    印度新政府上台一个月干尽坏事
    拍卖民族利益　加紧投靠美苏　拚命扩军备战　充当反华急先锋
    新华社十九日讯　本社记者评述：美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团大力扶植的印度新政府，上台已经一个月了。把它在这短短一个月中干下的反动勾当算一笔账，就能看出：美帝苏修正在通过这个反动政府，进一步控制印度，奴役印度人民，并且把印度变成反华包围圈的一个重要环节。
    印度新政府为了对付人民日益增长的反抗，维持自己愈来愈不稳的统治，无论在政治上、经济上、军事上都把印度的民族利益大肆出卖给美帝和苏修。它投靠美帝和苏修的步子比过去迈得更大了。
    在政治上，新政府一上台就加紧反华，大喊要“收复失地”，干涉中国内政，妄想帮助西藏农奴主复辟。同时，它同联合国秘书长吴丹勾结在一起，共同策划进一步推行“和谈”骗局的新阴谋，来掩盖他们的美国主子扩大侵越战争的罪行。
    特别引人注意的是，美国的国际间谍机构中央情报局的一个外围组织在印度召开的一个大会，印度副总统去致开幕词，印度政府的一名大官当了大会主席。中央情报局人员深入印度的各个部门，美国特务系统和印度特务系统实际上已联结在一起。
    在经济上，印度新政府一上台就宣布答应美帝的要求，打开大门，让那些美国垄断资本家涌入印度，垄断最能赚钱的化肥工业，狠毒地剥削印度劳动人民。这样，美国垄断资本大量渗入印度，控制它的工业部门的阴谋，又进一步得到了实现。
    在军事上，印度反动政府秉承美帝苏修的意旨，不顾人民死活，拚命扩军备战，作出了一个庞大的军费预算（约占总支出的三分之一），使印度变成一个巨大的反华军事基地。最近，印度反动政府以对付所谓中国的“核威胁”为名，要求美帝苏修给予印度“核保护”，实际上是同美帝苏修公开结成军事同盟，妄图利用这两个核霸王的核武器来吓唬中国和其它邻国。
    仅仅一个月，印度反动政府就进行了这许多亲美、联苏、反华、反人民的罪恶勾当。美帝大老板赞赏印度这个奴才干得卖力，马上大量地给赏钱，给粮食。最近，由美国等组成的“援印财团”宣布今年将给印度一千万吨粮食，还同意提供大约十三亿美元（包括粮食）的新“援助”。苏修大老板也感到满意，拚命给它涂脂抹粉，抬高印度反动政府的身价。这几天，苏修趁苏印建交二十周年，敲锣打鼓，大卖“苏印合作”的狗皮膏药，替印度新政府打气。
    美帝苏修这样做，是早有它们的打算的。为了包围中国，美帝从日本本土、冲绳、台湾、南越一直到泰国，已经进行了大规模的军事布置，建立了许多军事基地，在中国的东面和南面建立了半个包围圈。苏修在中国的西面和北面也建立了半个包围圈。它们两家合伙经营，把印度这一大片土地变成它们的军事基地，两个半圈就联接起来，成为一个完整的反华包围圈。
    印度在美帝苏修的反华战略中所处的这个重要地位，使美帝苏修不惜花很大本钱、很大力气去压服、控制、奴役它的广大人民。但是，正象中国共产党八届十一中全会的公报所指出的：“美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗对革命群众的残酷镇压、疯狂进攻和收买欺骗，都不能挽救他们灭亡的命运，相反，只能进一步地促进各国人民的革命觉醒。”
    去年以来，印度人民用暴力反抗暴政的斗争日益发展。印度国大党的一党反动统治愈来愈不稳。今年二月的大选以后，它在半数的邦内失去了对邦政府的控制。在一些邦内，一再发生愤怒的群众抢粮和抢武器的事件。一直在坚持武装斗争的那加族和米佐族，继续在深山密林中打击印度反动军队。印度各地都布满干柴烈火。不管印度反动派会采取怎样大规模的法西斯恐怖行动，印度人民的反抗斗争是绝对扑不灭、压不倒的。
    印度革命人民的斗争一定会胜利。一个真正独立、民主的新印度一定会出现。
