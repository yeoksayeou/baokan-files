Three African Nationalist Organizations Denounce Soviet Revisionists for Sabotaging the Fighting Unity of Asian and African Peoples

World Revolutionary Peoples Resolutely Oppose Soviet Revisionists' Vile Plots

Mozambique Revolutionary Committee Exposes U.S.-Soviet Collusion in Suppressing Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Struggles of Peoples

	New Delhi, April 1 (Xinhua) - The Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), the Basutoland Congress Party, and the South West Africa People's Organization representatives in London issued a joint statement on March 31 denouncing the illegal Nicosia meeting, manipulated by the Soviet revisionist leadership, which obstructed the fifth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing this year.

	The joint statement pointed out: "The illegal meeting convened and manipulated by the Soviet revisionists aims to overturn all the resolutions passed at the fourth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference held in Ghana's Winneba in 1965." The statement said that the Winneba conference unanimously decided that the fifth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference would be held in Beijing in 1967.

	The statement said: "The Soviet revisionists are attempting to split the fighting unity of the Asian and African peoples, rallying some misguided individuals to betray the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples." The statement pointed out: "Their vile plots have met with strong opposition from the revolutionary peoples of the world."

	The statement emphasized: "The splitters of modern revisionism, at a time when their U.S. allies are intensifying their aggression against the heroic Vietnamese people, are plotting to sabotage the anti-imperialist solidarity of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Organization. The actual result of U.S.-Soviet cooperation in Europe is that the U.S. imperialist butchers have been able to withdraw their troops of aggression from Europe and send them to Vietnam."

	The statement said that the fifth session to be held this year in the People's Republic of China will be filled with a fighting anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit from beginning to end. This session will pass resolutions supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national liberation, and the splitters of modern revisionism are terrified of this, deciding to sabotage the resolutions unanimously passed at the fourth session and attempting to change the venue of the conference to Algeria, thereby launching a comprehensive attack on the unity of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Organization. They are obviously afraid of the fifth session being held in the bastion of the world's anti-imperialist struggle—China.

	Khartoum, April 3 (Xinhua) - The Secretariat of the Sudanese Asian and African Solidarity Organization issued a statement on April 2 reaffirming adherence to the resolution of the Winneba conference regarding the fifth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

	The statement expressed opposition to the so-called eighth session of the Asian and African Solidarity Council, illegally convened and manipulated by Soviet revisionists in Nicosia, and "condemned the attempt to divert this session from the center of contemporary revolutionary struggle."

	The statement supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. It said: "The heroic Vietnamese people have set a brilliant example in their people's war against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys for other peoples of the world."

	The statement also supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, the Somali coast, the occupied southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine, and other regions against imperialism.

	The statement called on the Sudanese people to support the revolutionary peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

	Cairo, April 1 (Xinhua) - The representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee in Cairo, Sissolo, issued a statement on March 31 saying that the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee welcomed the establishment of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the fifth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference and wished the committee great success in fulfilling its noble mission.

	The statement said that the announcement of the establishment of this preparatory committee is "a fatal blow to the splitter plot of the Soviet modern revisionists. The Soviet modern revisionists are busy colluding with U.S. imperialism to suppress the struggles of the peoples of various countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

	The statement said: "The fifth session of the Asian and African Peoples' Solidarity Conference will gather all the genuine revolutionary forces of the two continents, and the result will surely bring about a great development in our people's glorious cause."

	The statement strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' splitter activities at the illegal Nicosia meeting. The statement exposed that the Soviet modern revisionists illegally expelled the South West Africa People's Organization while desperately preventing the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee and other organizations from participating in the meeting, thus once again exposing their traitorous faces against genuine liberation movements.

	The statement concluded: "The revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, despite the sabotage by the reactionaries, are determined to continue the struggle until they achieve complete victory and liberate all humanity from oppression and exploitation. As Chairman Mao said, the reactionaries can only 'cause trouble, fail, cause more trouble, fail again, until they are doomed to perish.'"

    三个非洲民族主义组织谴责苏修破坏亚非人民的战斗团结
    世界革命人民坚决反对苏修卑鄙阴谋
    莫三鼻给革命委员会揭露苏美勾结镇压各国人民反帝反殖斗争
    新华社伦敦一日电  阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会、巴苏陀兰大会党和西南非洲民族联盟驻伦敦代表三月三十一日在这里发表联合声明，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团操纵的非法的尼科西亚会议阻挠原定今年在北京召开的第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    联合声明指出：“由苏修召开和操纵的非法会议，目的在于推翻一九六五年在加纳温尼巴召开的第四届亚非人民团结大会通过的一切决议。”声明说，温尼巴大会一致决定，第五届亚非人民团结大会一九六七年在北京举行。
    声明说：“苏修企图分裂亚非人民的战斗团结，纠集了一些误入歧途的人，以便背叛亚非人民的革命事业。”声明指出：“他们的卑鄙阴谋已遭到全世界革命人民的强烈反对。”
    声明强调指出，“修正主义分裂者在他们的美国盟友对英勇的越南人民加紧进行侵略战争的时候，对亚非人民团结组织的反帝团结策划颠覆阴谋，这是意味深长的。苏美在欧洲进行合作的实际结果使美帝国主义刽子手有可能从欧洲撤出他们的侵略军调到越南去”。
    声明说，今年将在中华人民共和国召开的第五届大会将自始至终地充满着战斗的反帝革命精神，这次大会将通过支持正在进行救国斗争的越南人民的革命决议，修正主义分裂者对此怕得要死，决定破坏第四届大会一致通过的决议，企图把大会地点改在阿尔及利亚，从而向亚非人民团结组织的团结发起了全面攻击。他们显然害怕在世界反帝斗争的堡垒——中国召开的第五届大会。
    新华社喀土穆三日电  苏丹亚非团结组织书记处二日发表声明，重申遵守温尼巴大会关于今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议。
    声明表示抵制苏联修正主义者操纵的在尼科西亚非法举行的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，并且“谴责目的在于把这届大会从当代革命斗争的中心转移的企图”。
    声明支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。它说：“英雄的越南人民在进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的人民战争方面，为其他国家的人民树立了杰出的榜样。”
    声明还支持安哥拉、莫三鼻给、津巴布韦、索马里海岸、被占领的阿拉伯半岛南部、巴勒斯坦和其他地区的一切革命人民的反帝斗争。
    声明号召苏丹人民支持革命人民反对帝国主义的斗争。
    新华社开罗一日电  莫三鼻给革命委员会驻开罗代表西索尔三月三十一日在这里发表声明说，莫三鼻给革命委员会欢呼第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会的成立，并预祝这个筹委会在完成它的崇高任务中获得巨大胜利。
    声明说，宣布成立这个筹委会是“对苏联现代修正主义者的分裂主义阴谋的致命打击。苏联现代修正主义者正在忙于跟美帝国主义勾结，镇压各国人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。”
    声明说：“第五届亚非人民团结大会将集聚两大洲一切真正的革命力量，其结果必将使我们人民的光荣事业取得重大的发展。”
    声明强烈谴责苏修在非法的尼科西亚会议上的分裂活动。声明揭露说，苏联现代修正主义者非法开除西南非洲民族联盟，同时拚命地不让莫三鼻给革命委员会和其他组织参加会议，这就再一次暴露了他们反对真正的解放运动的叛徒嘴脸。
    声明最后说：“亚非拉的革命人民不顾反动派的破坏，决心继续进行斗争，直到赢得完全胜利和全人类从压迫和剥削中得到解放。正如毛主席所说的，反动派只能是‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡’。”
