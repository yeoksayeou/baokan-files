The Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has consistently stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely supported the revolutionary leftist masses, and decisively suppressed the counter-revolutionary organizations that launched a counterattack against the revolutionary organizations. It has contributed to the great cause of the revolutionary leftists in Heilongjiang Province uniting in a great alliance and launching a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. It has provided valuable experience for the army in responding to Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses.

1. Follow Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line, and stand on the side of the proletarian leftist masses.

Chairman Mao said: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people, to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, is the sole purpose of this army." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region realized: As the great leader Mao Zedong's personally created revolutionary army, as the most important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in this great struggle between two classes and two lines, it is our glorious duty to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to ensure the smooth progress of the great proletarian democracy, to support the revolutionary masses, and to concentrate our efforts on striking down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, a handful of power-holders within the former Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, created a white terror, and suppressed and persecuted the revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters. The leading comrades of the military region promptly and seriously analyzed and studied these situations. They believed: In this fierce class struggle, the army cannot remain neutral. Not only in thought and emotion, but also in actual actions, we must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and on the side of the revolutionary leftist masses. They led the troops to follow Chairman Mao closely and learn from the revolutionary youngsters, advancing along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The leading cadres of the military region followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." They went deep into the masses and established deep class feelings with the revolutionary youngsters. Various levels of leadership organs and troops established contacts with many revolutionary leftist organizations across the province, collected various materials; through the Military Affairs Department, militia organizations, guard troops, family members, and other channels, they grasped the dynamics of all aspects; they planned and purposefully sent out a large number of investigators to extensively contact society, clarify the nature of various factions, especially those with strong local influence and large organizations, grasp their movements, pay attention to their development and changes; and maintain close contact with local garrison troops, exchanging information. Based on investigation and research, the Party committee continuously followed Chairman Mao's teachings, using the method of class analysis to unify understanding. When identifying the leftists, conservatives, and rightists, they did not look at the number of people, the stability of their steps, but at their overall direction; they did not look at a single incident, but at the mainstream and essence; they did not look at their surface declarations and statements, but listened to their words and observed their actions, and more importantly, observed their actions. Because of this, the comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region were able to have a clear understanding of the political attitudes of the larger mass organizations in the province and the basic dynamics of key areas. Despite the complex situations, they were not deceived by surface phenomena or rumors, and accurately and powerfully supported the revolutionary leftists, seizing the opportunity to strike down the rightists.

2. To support the revolutionary faction, one must put "public" first and be bold, with a firm stance and clear banner.

Chairman Mao said: "A thorough materialist is fearless. We hope that all those who struggle with us will bravely take on responsibilities, overcome difficulties, not fear setbacks, not fear criticism and ridicule, and not fear making criticisms and suggestions to us communists." The comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region believed: Whether or not to firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary leftists, and whether or not to wholeheartedly and fully support the broad revolutionary leftist masses, is a matter of stance, a matter of attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

In practice, they increasingly deeply felt that to resolutely support the broad revolutionary leftist masses, one must first become a true revolutionary leftist armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Since last August, the leading comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region have made even greater efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the transformation of their worldview, break down the "self" and establish the "public," fundamentally raise class consciousness; at the same time, organize army officers and soldiers to persist in studying the brilliant works such as "Old Three Articles," "Against Liberalism," and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," as well as Chairman Mao's expositions on class struggle and the mass line, and seriously learn the spirit of the revolutionary youngsters who dare to think, speak, act, rebel, and make a revolution. Because Mao Zedong Thought has armed their minds, in supporting the leftist struggle, they fear neither risks nor attacks, nor the opposition of the enemy, fully embodying the determination to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and the unlimited loyalty and faith in Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

They trusted the masses, relied on the masses, and fought alongside the revolutionary masses. In this regard, some major responsible comrades of the military region set an example first. They have maintained close contact with the revolutionary youngsters for a long time, analyzing the situation together, studying problems, and forming deep revolutionary friendships. When the revolutionary leftist organizations were still a small minority, the military region did not hesitate to provide assistance and support them; when the enemy forces attempted to obstruct and sabotage the revolutionary leftists, they helped the leftists expose the enemy's various plots, improve their fighting strategies and levels; when the revolutionary leftist masses suffered setbacks, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" and "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party" with the leftists, raising their confidence and courage in victory; and when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a new stage, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party entered the decisive moment of the final showdown, they immediately stepped forward, actively and proactively united with the revolutionary leftist masses and revolutionary leading cadres to launch the struggle to seize power. And they decisively suppressed the reactionary organizations that suddenly counterattacked the revolutionary leftist organizations, continuously defeating the various plots of the counter-revolutionary organizations.

The "August 8th Corps" in Harbin was the most stubborn and powerful rightist organization. The military region and the leftist revolutionary masses joined forces to do a lot of work to split and disintegrate them. On January 19th, the "August 8th Corps" deceived some masses to come to the military region headquarters to cause trouble, making their last struggle. The comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region resolutely counterattacked, with leading comrades personally delivering the instructions of the central leaders, solemnly pointing out the errors of the "August 8th Corps," exposing the deceptive and reactionary nature of the "August 8th Corps." And they patiently persuaded and educated the majority of the deceived masses, making them feel the warmth of Mao Zedong Thought and the care of the People's Liberation Army for them. Many masses were deeply moved, some cried bitterly, and on the spot tore off their armbands and announced their withdrawal from the "August 8th Corps." The handful of leaders of the "August 8th Corps," seeing that the situation was hopeless, went back and announced the dissolution of the organization. At the moment when the revolutionary leftists were attacked by the rightists, the military region also decisively dispatched patrol teams to provide protection, greatly encouraging the red rebels.

They dared to step forward in the most difficult times and the most dangerous places, becoming the backbone of defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some military affairs departments, under the white terror when the enemy was very arrogant, were surrounded by the rightists and could not eat for several days, but they remained steadfastly on the side of the revolutionary leftists, giving them advice, preserving materials, and encouraging them to continue the struggle, quickly turning the situation around.

3. The most fundamental support for the revolutionary leftist masses is political support, support of Mao Zedong Thought.

At the critical moment of the struggle to seize power in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great commander Chairman Mao issued a battle call to the entire army: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses. The soldiers and officers of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region were greatly inspired, entering a new stage in their support for the leftists.

They believed that the most fundamental support for the broad revolutionary leftist masses is political support, support of Mao Zedong Thought. They correctly handled the relationship between political support and military action support, regarding political support and support of Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental support, criticizing the erroneous idea of some grassroots leading cadres that support means sending troops, neglecting political support, and not wanting to do hard and detailed work. When the army needed to take action, they mainly relied on political offensives, propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, and propaganda of the Party's policies to win over and educate the majority of the deceived masses, isolating and striking down a few ringleaders. In some places, the revolutionary faction's forces were weak and surrounded by white terror, facing serious threats of attacks by counter-revolutionary organizations, they promptly dispatched troops to protect the leftists and carried out in-depth propaganda work with the leftists, exposing the counter-revolutionary plots, awakening the deceived masses, and accelerating the collapse of the reactionary organizations. In some places, reactionary organizations attempted to suppress the revolutionary masses, the army promptly made their firm stance clear to them, taking the initiative to prevent bloodshed and quickly turning the situation around.

In terms of political support, they mainly adopted the following measures:

(1) Going deep into the revolutionary leftists to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, first achieving a great unity in ideology. In the process of establishing contacts between individuals and collective leftist revolutionary masses, they regarded the contact of Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental contact, through individual conversations, collective studies, and exchanges of experience, and jointly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, serving as good advisors for the masses.

(2) Turning the reception station into a propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought, doing a good job of receiving the masses who come to the door. They regarded the reception station as the best venue and opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the Party's policies, maintain close contact with the masses, and understand the situation. From last August to now, the military region headquarters have received thousands of visiting masses, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer various questions they raised.

(3) In the new situation where the proletarian revolutionary leftists implement a great alliance to seize power, through participating in the gatherings, parades, and celebrations of the revolutionary leftist organizations, as well as issuing telegrams, notices, distributing leaflets, writing articles in newspapers, and street propaganda, they publicly declared their firm stance of politically supporting the revolutionary leftist masses in various forms.

(4) Participating in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs of the revolution, and dispatching a large number of work teams to go deep into factories and rural areas, using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses.

The leading comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, following Chairman Mao's teachings, also paid attention to the relationship between internal and external factors. They believed that the masses can educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves. On the one hand, they fully supported the leftist masses in all major issues without reservation; on the other hand, they never took everything upon themselves, claiming to be all-powerful. They always remained humble and cautious, and for the shortcomings and problems that appeared in the leftist ranks, they never pointed fingers or imposed their will, but sincerely and sincerely put forward their suggestions.

4. Grasp the policy, pay attention to the strategy of struggle, and seriously implement the principle of "developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing obstinate forces."

Chairman Mao said: "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party. All levels of leading comrades must fully pay attention to this and never be careless." The Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region understood that Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing obstinate forces" is an indivisible whole. While supporting the leftists, they must also firmly fight against the rightist forces in politics and ideology, thus educating and uniting the intermediate forces, and expanding the leftist ranks.

They also fully utilized the contradictions within the rightist organizations, first striking down the most reactionary ones. They believed that although the stubborn faction within the reactionary organizations was in a dominant position, they were a small minority in number. Most of their organizational members were deceived, and there were also conflicts of interest and contradictions between the reactionary organizations and the rightist and conservative organizations. They could utilize their contradictions to organize "rebellions" from within their organizations. After the establishment of the reactionary organization "Prepared Forces," the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, on the one hand, communicated intelligence with the leftist revolutionary mass organizations and relevant departments; on the other hand, carried out splitting and disintegrating work within the core leadership of the "Prepared Forces." On one day in January, the reactionary leaders of the "Prepared Forces" planned to smash the "Harbin Battle News" office at night. That morning, the military region successfully disintegrated its core leadership, and someone rebelled from within, thwarting their evil plot.

In the process of developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing obstinate forces, the military region seriously followed the principles indicated by Chairman Mao, achieving reasonableness, benefits, and moderation, paying attention to grasping the opportunity, and always taking the initiative. They deeply felt that in the fierce and complex class struggle, the situation changes rapidly. Therefore, every time they issued a statement, expressed an attitude, or answered a question, they decided based on the development of the situation, the changes in the situation, and the actual needs of the struggle, achieving careful treatment, preparation, planning, and control, and paying attention to the art of struggle.

In the new situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the struggle to seize power, the soldiers and officers of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further unite with the red rebels and revolutionary cadres of Heilongjiang Province, to defend and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production!

    全心全意地支持革命派坚定不移地保卫无产阶级专政
    ——黑龙江省军区支持革命左派的经验
    龙卫东
    黑龙江省军区高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，始终坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地支持革命左派群众，坚决地镇压向革命组织反扑的反革命组织，为黑龙江省革命左派实行大联合、向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争，做出了贡献，为部队响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持革命左派广大群众的伟大号召，提供了有益的经验。
    一、紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，坚决站在无产阶级革命路线一边，站在无产阶级左派群众一边
    毛主席说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，黑龙江省军区认识到：作为伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造的革命军队，作为无产阶级专政的最重要工具，在这场两个阶级、两条路线的大搏斗中，誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级大民主的顺利进行，支持革命群众，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是自己义不容辞的光荣任务。
    无产阶级文化大革命一开始，前黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就公然对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行资产阶级反动路线，制造白色恐怖，打击和迫害革命群众和革命小将。省军区的领导同志，及时地认真地分析研究了这些情况。他们认为：在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，部队不介入是不行的。不光在思想感情上，而且在实际行动上，都必须坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在革命左派群众一边。他们带领部队，紧跟毛主席，并且向革命小将学习，沿着毛主席所指引的方向阔步前进。
    军区的领导干部遵循毛主席的“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，深入到群众中去，和革命小将建立了深厚的阶级感情。各级领导机关和部队与全省许多革命左派组织建立了联系，收集了各种材料；通过武装部、民兵组织、警卫部队、家属等各条渠道，掌握各方面的动态；有计划有目的地派出大批调查员，广泛地接触社会，查明各派，特别是查明那些在当地实力强、影响大的一些群众组织的性质，掌握动向，注意发展和变化；与当地驻军密切联系，互通情况。在调查研究的基础上，党委不断遵照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析的方法，统一认识。在识别左派、保守派和右派的时候，不是看它的人数多少，步子稳不稳，而是看它的大方向；不是看它的一时一事，而是看它的主流和本质；不是看它的表面的宣言和声明，而是听其言观其行，更重要的是观其行。正因为这样，黑龙江省军区的同志，才能够对省的较大群众组织的政治态度、重点地区的基本动态做到心中有数。尽管情况错综复杂，也不被表面现象所迷惑，不为谣言所欺骗，准确有力地支援革命左派，不失时机地打击了右派。
    二、支持革命派，必须“公”字挂帅，“敢”字当头，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明
    毛主席说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，我们希望一切同我们共同奋斗的人能够勇敢地负起责任，克服困难，不要怕挫折，不要怕有人议论讥笑，也不要怕向我们共产党人提批评建议。”黑龙江省军区的同志认为：敢不敢坚定地站在革命左派一边，是不是满腔热情地、全心全意地支持革命左派广大群众，是一个立场问题，是对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想的态度问题。
    在实践中，他们越来越深刻地体会到，要坚决支持革命左派广大群众，首先自己必须成为一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的真正的革命左派。黑龙江省军区的领导同志从去年八月起，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，加强世界观的改造，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，从根本上提高阶级觉悟；同时，组织部队干部、战士坚持学习“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作，以及毛主席关于阶级斗争、群众路线等论述，认真学习革命小将敢想、敢说、敢干、敢造反、敢革命的精神。由于毛泽东思想武装了他们的头脑，他们在支持左派斗争中，不怕担风险，不怕受围攻，更不怕被敌人反对，充分体现了保卫无产阶级专政的决心，充分体现了对毛主席和党中央的无限忠诚、无限信仰。
    他们信任群众，依靠群众，和革命群众战斗在一起。在这方面，省军区一些主要负责同志首先作出了榜样。他们很早就和革命小将保持密切联系，在一起分析形势，研究问题，结成了深厚的革命友谊。当革命左派组织暂时还是极少数的时候，省军区毫不犹豫地给予援助，给他们撑腰；当敌对势力企图阻挠和破坏革命左派的时候，他们就帮助左派识破敌人的各种阴谋，提高斗争策略和水平；当革命左派群众遭受挫折时，他们就和左派共同学习毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”和“政策和策略是党的生命”等教导，提高胜利信心和勇气；而当无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新的阶段，无产阶级同资产阶级及其在党内的代理人进入决战的关键时刻，他们立即挺身而出，积极主动地和革命左派群众以及革命的领导干部联合在一起，进行了夺权斗争。并且毫不犹豫地镇压了向革命左派组织突然反扑的反动组织，不断地击败反革命组织的各种阴谋活动。
    哈尔滨的“八八团”是最顽固、力量也较大的右派组织。省军区和左派革命群众结合在一起，对他们做了大量的分化瓦解工作。一月十九日，“八八团”欺骗了部分群众到省军区机关来捣乱，进行最后的挣扎。黑龙江省军区的同志坚决予以还击，由领导同志亲自出面，传达了中央首长的指示，严正地指出了“八八团”的错误，揭发了“八八团”的欺骗性和反动本质。并且对受蒙蔽的多数群众进行了耐心的说服教育，使他们感到毛泽东思想的温暖和人民解放军对他们的关怀。很多群众深受感动，有的痛哭流涕，当场撕下了袖标，宣布退出“八八团”。“八八团”的一小撮头子，见到大势已去，回去以后，宣布解散了组织。在革命左派遭到右派围攻的时刻，省军区还果断地派出巡逻队进行保护，使红色造反者受到很大的鼓舞。
    他们敢于在最困难的时候，最危险的地方，挺身而出，做保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。有的武装部在敌人十分嚣张的白色恐怖下，被右派包围，几天吃不上饭，却始终如一地坚定地站在革命左派一边，为他们出主意，保存材料，鼓励他们坚持斗争，使局势迅速好转。
    三、对革命左派群众的支持，最根本的是政治上的支持，是毛泽东思想的支持
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席向全军发出战斗号召：人民解放军应该积极支持革命左派广大群众。黑龙江省军区部队指战员受到了极大的鼓舞，使他们支持左派的斗争进入了一个新阶段。
    他们认为，支持革命左派广大群众最根本的是政治上的支持，是毛泽东思想的支持。他们正确处理了政治上支持和军事行动上支持的关系，把政治上的支持，毛泽东思想的支持，当做最根本的支持，批判了个别基层领导干部认为支持就是出兵，忽视政治上的支持，不愿做艰苦细致工作的错误思想。他们在部队有必要采取行动的时候，也都主要靠政治攻势，靠宣传毛泽东思想，靠宣传党的政策，争取教育大多数受蒙蔽的群众，孤立和打击少数首恶分子。有的地方革命派群众力量弱小，处于白色恐怖的包围之中，受到反革命组织袭击的严重威胁，他们及时派出部队保护左派，与左派一起进行深入的宣传工作，揭穿反革命的阴谋，使受蒙蔽的群众觉醒过来，加速了反动组织的崩溃。有的地方反革命组织企图镇压革命群众，部队及时向他们表明自己的坚定立场，先机制敌，防止了流血事件的发生，迅速地扭转了局势。
    政治上的支持，他们主要是采取：
    （1）深入到革命左派中去宣传毛泽东思想，首先搞好思想上的大联合。在集体和个人与左派革命群众互相联系中，把毛泽东思想的联系当成最根本的联系，通过个别交谈、集体学习、交流经验等各种方式，共同活学活用毛主席著作，为群众当好参谋。
    （2）把接待站办成毛泽东思想宣传站，做好“送上门”来的群众工作。他们把接待站看做是宣传毛泽东思想、宣传党的政策、密切与群众联系、了解情况的最好场合、最好机会。从去年八月到现在，省军区机关接待了来访群众数千人，运用毛泽东思想回答他们提出的各种问题。
    （3）在无产阶级革命左派实行大联合夺权的新形势下，通过参加革命左派组织的集会、游行、联欢活动，以及发通电、通告，撒传单，在报纸上写文章，街头宣传等多种形式，公开表明在政治上支持左派革命群众的坚定立场。
    （4）参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，并派出大批工作队，深入到工厂、农村中去，用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众。
    黑龙江省军区的领导同志按照毛主席的教导，还注意了内因和外因的关系。他们相信群众能够自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。一方面在所有重大问题上，毫无保留地支持左派群众；另一方面，又从不大包大揽，包打天下。他们时刻注意谦虚谨慎，对于左派队伍中出现的某些缺点和问题，从不指手划脚，强加于人，而是正面地、诚恳地提出自己的建议。
    四、掌握政策，讲究斗争策略，认真贯彻“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、反对顽固势力”的原则
    毛主席说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”黑龙江省军区体会到毛主席关于“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、反对顽固势力”的伟大策略思想，是一个不可分割的整体。在支持左派的同时，必须在政治上思想上同右派势力坚决斗争，这样才能教育和团结争取中间势力，壮大左派队伍。
    他们还充分利用了右派组织内部的矛盾，择其最反动者首先打击之。他们认为，反动组织内部的顽固派虽然站在支配的统治地位，但在数量上是极少数，它们的大多数组织成员是受蒙蔽的，而且反动组织与右派、保守组织之间也都存在着利害冲突，存在着矛盾。可以利用他们的矛盾，从他们的内部组织“起义”。反动组织“战备军”成立后，黑龙江省军区一方面与左派革命群众组织、有关部门通了情报；一方面在“战备军”的核心领导中，进行了分化瓦解工作。一月的一天，“战备军”的反动头目准备在晚间砸《哈尔滨战报》社。当天上午，省军区成功地瓦解了它的核心领导，有人从内部“起义”了，使他们的这一罪恶阴谋未能得逞。
    省军区在发展进步势力、争取中间势力、反对顽固势力的过程中，认真地按照毛主席指示的原则，做到有理有利有节，注意掌握时机，始终立于主动地位。他们深深感到，在阶级斗争激烈、复杂的情况下，形势瞬息万变。因此，每发表一个声明，表明一个态度，答复一个问题，都根据形势的发展、事态的变化和斗争的实际需要而决定，做到慎重对待，有准备，有计划，有把握，讲究斗争艺术。
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的新形势下，黑龙江省军区指战员决心按照毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持革命左派广大群众的指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和黑龙江省红色造反者、革命干部进一步联合起来，为保卫和巩固无产阶级政权，为夺取革命、生产双胜利，做出更大的贡献！
