Shanghai Agricultural Chemical Factory's revolutionary workers have excellently completed the first quarter's production tasks. The production of various types of agricultural chemicals has increased by 20% compared to the same period last year, providing strong support for current agricultural production.

After the revolutionary faction of Shanghai Agricultural Chemical Factory seized power, they placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront. They followed Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the person" to educate cadres who made general mistakes, helping them to reflect and correct their errors, and uniting them to work together, thus giving full play to the cadres' active role. At the same time, the full-time members of the revolutionary mass organizations also consciously returned to their production posts, taking the lead in labor, and quickly established a good order for both revolution and production.

    上海农药厂革命职工抓革命促生产
    增产各种农药支援农业生产
    据新华社上海三十日电　上海农药厂的无产阶级革命派和广大职工出色地完成了第一季度生产任务。各类农药产品产量比去年同期增加百分之二十，有力地支援了当前的农业生产。
    上海农药厂的革命派夺权以后，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首要地位。他们根据毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，教育犯有一般错误的干部检查、改正，团结他们一起工作，发挥了干部的积极作用。同时，革命群众组织的脱产人员也自觉地返回生产岗位，带头劳动，很快建立了革命和生产的良好秩序。
