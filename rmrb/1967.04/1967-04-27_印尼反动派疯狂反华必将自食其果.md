The Indonesian right-wing military regime has recently taken a series of outrageous anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, madly sabotaging the relations between China and Indonesia. Their brutality and recklessness have reached an unprecedented level. The Indonesian reactionary authorities, in early April, murdered the patriotic overseas Chinese Huang Jianmin in East Java and Ning Xiangyu, a member of the Jakarta Chinese Association, in Jakarta. On April 20, they dispatched a large number of armed military and police to attack the funeral procession of our overseas Chinese for Ning Xiangyu, resulting in more than ten of our compatriots being injured in a bloody incident. Subsequently, they began mass arrests of Chinese. On April 23, they even sent a large number of military and police to surround and blockade the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, abducting and detaining our Consul-General Xu Ren. On April 24, they unreasonably declared that the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Yao Denshan, and Consul-General Xu Ren are "unwelcome persons." The Chinese people are greatly indignant at the brutal and despicable actions of the Indonesian reactionaries and strongly protest and condemn their heinous crimes.

The actions of the Indonesian reactionary authorities have once again proven to the world that they are a thorough and complete fascist regime. To achieve their evil goal of anti-China and anti-Chinese, they can brutally violate the most basic international norms; they can fabricate lies and shamelessly deny; they can distort right and wrong and slander. They savagely murdered innocent overseas Chinese but falsely accused them of fabricated crimes to shift the blame. They organized a bloody attack on the funeral procession of our overseas Chinese but falsely accused the legitimate and just actions of the overseas Chinese of being "subversive activities," attempting to shift the blame. They surrounded our embassy with armed forces, directly violating the personal freedom of our diplomatic personnel, but falsely accused us of "creating" a situation that worsened relations between the two countries, unreasonably forcing our Acting Charge d'Affaires and Consul-General to leave the country. This is truly shameless to the extreme!

It is clear that the series of serious anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents that have recently occurred in Indonesia are the result of careful planning by the Indonesian reactionary authorities and are a necessary development of their policy to decisively oppose the Chinese people. Since the Indonesian right-wing military regime came to power, it has launched large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. Over the past year, the Indonesian reactionary authorities have repeatedly dispatched military and police to organize thugs to attack and sabotage our embassy, consulates, and other representative institutions, looting, occupying, arson, and rampaging. At the same time, they have launched wave after wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns, subjecting overseas Chinese to inhuman persecution, extortion, plundering property, forced relocation, looting homes, unreasonable arrests, and bloody massacres, using every means possible.

The savage and brutal anti-China and anti-Chinese actions of the Indonesian reactionaries are comparable only to those of the Hitler fascist gangsters and are rare in the history of international relations. The actions of the Indonesian reactionaries are completely those of bandits and are nothing like a sovereign government! The Indonesian right-wing military regime's mad anti-China actions are determined by the extremely reactionary class nature of this regime. This regime represents the interests of the Indonesian landlord class and the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, opposing communism and the people domestically, and being pro-American and selling out the country internationally. It is a tool used by American imperialism and its running dogs to brutally suppress and exploit the Indonesian people. Since the Indonesian right-wing military clique, with the direct plotting of American imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary military coup on October 1, 1965, it has, with horrifying fascist methods, implemented counter-revolutionary policies of anti-communism and anti-people nationwide, carrying out mass arrests, purges, and massacres. Tens of thousands of Indonesian Communist Party members and patriotic people have been killed by the reactionaries, and tens of thousands of Indonesian revolutionaries have been thrown into dark prisons and concentration camps. Today's Indonesia is a place where patriotism is a crime and counter-revolution is a merit; patriotic people are massacred, and prisons are everywhere.

The Indonesian right-wing military regime relies on American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for support, living off their handouts. It no longer opposes imperialism and old and new colonialism, nor does it resist the product of new colonialism, "Malaysia," but instead, in accordance with the intentions of American imperialism, tightly colludes with its running dogs and lackeys to form a new Southeast Asian aggression alliance. It even openly colludes with "Malaysia" to suppress the national liberation struggle of the people of North Kalimantan. The Indonesian right-wing fascist regime is willing to sell out the country for personal gain, becoming a shameful running dog of American imperialism's aggression in Asia.

In recent times, American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique have intensified their collusion to form a encirclement against China. In their joint anti-China conspiracy, the Indonesian reactionaries have been assigned the role of a vanguard. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, to further encourage the Indonesian right-wing fascist clique to be anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China, have provided it with large amounts of support. The collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and the Indonesian reactionaries has also become increasingly close. It is clear that the recent new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese actions by the Indonesian right-wing fascist regime is entirely carried out under the instructions and encouragement of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

The Indonesian right-wing fascist regime, supported by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, appears fierce but is extremely weak, and its foundation is very unstable. Class struggle in Indonesia is unprecedentedly fierce, and the contradictions between the Indonesian people and American imperialism and its running dogs are unprecedentedly sharp. The economic crisis is extremely serious, with soaring prices and widespread chaos. Where there is oppression, there is resistance; the greater the oppression, the greater the resistance. The Indonesian people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will absolutely not allow this brutal fascist regime to continue its rule. They are burying their fallen comrades and standing up from the bloodshed to continue their brave struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. No force in the world can stop the great Indonesian people from advancing. The Indonesian people will surely repel the counter-revolutionary tide and continue to advance the Indonesian revolution to victory!

The Chinese people have always harbored friendly and fraternal feelings towards the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people and the Chinese people have formed a close and combat-friendly friendship in the long struggle against imperialism. American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries want to use their mad anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities to destroy this great friendship, but they are doomed to fail.

Today, our compatriots residing in Indonesia for generations are under the bloody persecution of the Indonesian right-wing fascist regime. However, our patriotic compatriots, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, have united with the Indonesian people to fight against the Indonesian reactionaries in a brave and unyielding struggle to defend the dignity of our motherland and protect their legitimate rights. Their struggle is completely just and will surely be victorious. The seven hundred million people of our motherland are determined to be the strong backing of our patriotic compatriots.

We must sternly warn the Indonesian authorities that the great Chinese people are not to be trifled with. You have planned and organized anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities, intending to completely sabotage the diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia. You owe the Chinese people blood debt after blood debt. Blood debts must be repaid. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by American imperialism will ultimately become sacrificial offerings for American imperialism." This small group of anti-China clowns and ten-thousand-fold fascists in Indonesia will surely receive the most severe punishment from history and will become sacrificial offerings for American imperialism!

The Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, firmly support the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for freedom and liberation. No matter how rampant the Indonesian reactionaries are in their anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, they will never shake our just stance. The Chinese people and the Indonesian people will forever stand together, fight together, and win together!

    印尼反动派疯狂反华必将自食其果
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权，最近接连采取一系列反华排华的猖獗行动，疯狂破坏中国和印尼两国关系，其横蛮无理，丧心病狂，达到了登峰造极的地步。印尼反动当局在四月初，先后杀害了东爪哇的爱国华侨黄健民和雅加达中华侨团总会理事宁祥雨。四月二十日，又在雅加达出动大批武装军警袭击华侨为宁祥雨老人送葬的行列，制造了打伤我侨胞十多人的血腥事件，接着开始大肆逮捕华侨。四月二十三日，它竟派出大批军警包围和封锁中国驻印尼大使馆，武装劫持和扣留我国驻雅加达总领事徐仁，并于四月二十四日无理宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和总领事徐仁为“不受欢迎的人”。中国人民对于印尼反动派这种残暴和卑劣的行径，感到极大的愤慨，并强烈抗议和谴责印尼反动派的滔天罪行。
    印尼反动当局的所作所为，再一次向全世界证明，它是一个彻头彻尾的法西斯政权。印尼反动派为了达到反华排华的罪恶目的，可以粗暴破坏最起码的国际关系准则；可以捏造谎言，当面耍赖；可以颠倒黑白，含血喷人。他们野蛮杀害了无辜的华侨，竟然把莫须有的罪名强加在我死难侨胞的头上，以图推卸罪责。他们对华侨的送葬行列组织了血腥的袭击，竟然反诬送葬华侨的正当和正义行动是什么“颠覆活动”，想倒打一耙。他们对我国大使馆进行武装包围，直接侵犯我外交人员的人身自由，竟然反而污蔑我方“制造”致使两国“关系更为恶化的局势”，无理迫使我大使馆临时代办和总领事离境。真是无耻到了极点！
    很显然，最近在印度尼西亚发生的一系列严重的反华、排华事件，是印尼反动当局精心策划的步骤，也是它决意与中国人民为敌的既定政策的必然发展。印尼右派军人政权上台以后，就发动了大规模的反华排华活动。一年多以来，印尼反动当局不断出动军警，组织暴徒袭击和破坏我国大使馆、领事馆等代表机构，抢劫霸占，放火行凶，横行霸道，无所不为。与此同时，它掀起了一次又一次反华排华浪潮，对华侨进行灭绝人性的迫害，敲榨勒索，掠夺资产，强行逼迁，打家劫舍，无理逮捕，血腥屠杀，无所不用其极。
    印尼反动派猖狂反华排华的野蛮暴行，只有希特勒法西斯匪徒才能相比，在国际关系史上是罕见的。印尼反动派的所作所为，完全是强盗行径，哪里还象一个主权国家政府的样子呢？！
    印尼右派军人政权疯狂反华，是由这个政权的极端反动的阶级本质所决定的。这个政权，集中地代表了印尼大地主阶级和官僚买办资产阶级的利益，对内反共反人民，对外亲美卖国，是美帝国主义及其走狗残酷镇压和剥削印尼人民的工具。印尼右派将领集团自从前年十月一日在美帝国主义的直接策划下发动反革命军事政变以后，就在全国范围内，以骇人听闻的法西斯手段，推行反共反人民的反革命政策，实行大逮捕、大清洗、大屠杀。数十万印尼共产党人和爱国人民死于反动派的屠刀之下，又有数十万印尼革命者被投入阴暗的牢房和集中营。今日之印尼，爱国有罪，反革命有功；爱国人民惨遭屠杀，冤狱遍于全国。
    印尼右派军人政权对外投靠美帝国主义和苏修领导集团，依靠它们的施舍来过日子。它不仅不再反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，不再对抗新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”，反而秉承美帝国主义的意旨同它的走狗和仆从加紧勾结，拼凑新的东南亚侵略联盟，甚至公然伙同“马来西亚”，来镇压北加里曼丹人民的民族解放斗争。印尼右派法西斯政权，不惜卖国求荣，充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的一名可耻的走卒。
    最近以来，美帝国主义和苏修领导集团加紧勾结，建立反对中国的包围圈。在它们合伙反华的大阴谋中，印尼反动派已被派定充当一名急先锋的角色。美帝和苏修为了进一步鼓励印尼右派法西斯集团反共、反人民和反华，大量地给它输血。苏修领导集团同印尼反动派的勾结也越来越紧密。很显然，印尼右派法西斯政权最近的反华排华新浪潮，完全是在美帝国主义和苏修领导集团的指使和鼓励下搞起来的。
    为美帝和苏修所支持的印尼右派法西斯政权，看起来很凶恶，其实它是极端虚弱的，它的基础是非常不稳固的。印尼国内阶级斗争空前激烈，印尼人民同美帝国主义及其走卒的矛盾空前尖锐化。经济危机极端严重，物价飞涨，民不聊生，全国一片混乱。有压迫，就有反抗；压迫愈甚，反抗也就愈烈。富有光荣革命传统的印尼人民，绝对不会容忍这个残暴的法西斯政权统治下去。他们正在掩埋好自己同伴的尸体，从血泊中站立起来，继续同印尼反动派展开英勇的斗争。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡伟大的印尼人民前进的步伐，印尼人民终将打退反革命逆流，把印尼的革命事业继续推向胜利！
    中国人民对印尼人民始终不渝地怀着友好的、兄弟的感情。印尼人民和中国人民，在长期反对帝国主义的斗争中，结成了亲密的战斗的友谊。美帝国主义和印尼反动派想要用疯狂反华、排华的暴行来破坏这个伟大的友谊，是注定要破产的。
    世世代代侨居在印尼的我国同胞，今天处于印尼右派法西斯政权的血腥迫害之下。但是，我们的爱国侨胞，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，为了维护祖国的尊严，保卫自己的正当权利，和印尼人民团结在一起，向印尼反动派展开了英勇不屈的反迫害斗争。他们的斗争是完全正义的，是一定要取得胜利的。七亿祖国人民誓作我爱国侨胞的强大后盾。
    我们要严厉警告印尼当局，伟大的中国人民是不可侮的。你们有计划有组织地制造反华、排华暴行，蓄意彻底破坏中国和印尼两国的外交关系，你们对中国人民欠下了一笔又一笔血债。血债是一定要偿还的。毛主席指出：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”印尼这一小撮反华的小丑，十恶不赦的法西斯，必将受到历史最严厉的惩罚，必将成为美帝国主义的殉葬品！
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，坚决支持印尼人民反帝反殖和争取自由解放的革命斗争。无论印尼反动派怎样猖獗地反华排华，也绝不能动摇我们这种正义的立场。中国人民和印尼人民将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
