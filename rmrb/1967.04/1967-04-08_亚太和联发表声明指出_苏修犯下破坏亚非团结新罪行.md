The Asia-Pacific Peace Committee today issued a statement strongly condemning the plot by the Soviet revisionist leadership to hold the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. The statement pointed out that the black meeting in Beirut is a treacherous act of splitting and undermining Asian-African unity by the Soviet revisionists, and it is a shameful exposure of their further collaboration with the main enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism.

The statement emphasized that there is only one genuine Asian-African writers' organization, whose permanent office is in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with Mr. Sennanayake as its secretary-general. It successfully held the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference in Beijing in June 1966 and decided to hold the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference in Beijing in 1967.

    亚太和联发表声明指出
    苏修犯下破坏亚非团结新罪行
    据新华社七日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会今天发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团策划的在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。声明指出，贝鲁特的黑会是苏修分裂和破坏亚非团结的一种叛卖罪行，是与全世界人民的主要敌人美帝国主义进一步合作的可耻暴露。
    声明强调说，真正的亚非作家组织只有一个，它的常设局在锡兰的科伦坡，秘书长是森纳那亚克先生。它于一九六六年六月在北京成功地举行了亚非作家紧急会议，并决定于一九六七在北京举行第三次亚非作家大会。
