    Resolutely Betraying China to Ally with the US and the Soviet Union
    India Openly Seeks "Nuclear Protection" from the US and the Soviet Union

    New Delhi, April 15 (Xinhua) — The reactionary and traitorous government of India has openly stated that it wants nuclear protection from U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique to supposedly counter the "nuclear threat" from China. This would place India under the control of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, openly forming a military alliance with them to oppose China and other neighboring countries.

    According to a report by an Indian news agency on the 13th, Indian Foreign Minister Chagla, in response to a question from a reporter of the Washington Post in New Delhi, said that the Indian government is now firmly seeking a joint guarantee from the U.S. and the Soviet Union to "protect it from nuclear attacks."

    Chagla will go to Geneva to discuss the issue of the U.S. and the Soviet Union providing "nuclear protection" to the Indian government. The secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's office, Jeha, has just conducted a "probe" in Moscow on this issue and on the 13th rushed to Washington to conduct another "probe." According to a revelation from an embassy of an Eastern European country in New Delhi: the Soviet authorities "may provide guarantees according to the wishes of the Indian (government)."

    According to the report, if the U.S. and the Soviet Union agree to the Indian government's request, India will agree to sign the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. and the Soviet Union created this treaty to maintain their nuclear monopoly, engage in nuclear blackmail, and continue their conspiracy to dominate the world through U.S.-Soviet cooperation.

    死心塌地投靠美苏　结成反华军事同盟
    印度公然要美苏给予“核保护”
    新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：印度反动卖国政府公开表示要美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团给予“核保护”，以对付所谓中国的“核威胁”为名，把印度放在美帝苏修的控制下，同美帝苏修公开结成军事同盟，反对中国和其它邻国。
    据印度的一家通讯社十三日报道，印度外交部长查格拉在答复美国《华盛顿邮报》驻新德里记者问时说，印度政府现在非常肯定地在竭力争取美苏联合保证它“免受核攻击”。
    查格拉将到日内瓦去商谈美帝苏修给印度政府“核保护”的问题。印度总理的秘书处秘书杰哈刚刚就这个问题在莫斯科进行了“试探”，十三日又跑到华盛顿去进行“试探”。据一个东欧国家驻新德里的大使馆透露：苏联当局“可能按照印度（政府）的愿望提供保证”。
    据报道，如果美帝苏修答应印度政府的这个要求，印度就同意在美帝苏修合谋制造的“防止核扩散条约”上签字。美帝苏修制造这个条约是为了保持美苏核垄断，进行核讹诈，继续推行美苏合作主宰世界的阴谋。
