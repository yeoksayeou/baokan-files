Chairman Mao said: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish always makes a final struggle against the revolutionary force."

The Chinese Writers Association today issued a statement titled "Great Surrender, Great Split, Great Exposure, Great Bankruptcy" regarding the bogus "Third Asian-African Writers Conference" held in Beirut. The full text is as follows:

The bogus "Third Asian-African Writers Conference," directed by the Soviet modern revisionists, was a complete failure from the beginning to the end in just five days. It was sternly condemned and exposed by the writers' organizations and nationalist parties of dozens of Asian and African countries. On March 29, after this bogus conference hastily concluded, the Soviet revisionists and their few followers, with swollen faces, tried to pass off their failure as a victory, attempting to deceive and mislead the public. However, those who know a little about the truth understand that this bogus conference was extremely chaotic and far from being respectable. The Soviet revisionists' line of surrender and split, which they have been vigorously promoting, has once again suffered a heavy defeat.

The Chinese Writers Association firmly supports the statement issued by the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau on April 13. This statement expresses the common stance of the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, and it is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists.

The sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, our great leader Chairman Mao, said: "The world is progressing, and the future is bright. This historical trend cannot be changed by anyone."

On the "stage" of the bogus "Third Conference," the Soviet representatives shamelessly exposed their ugly faces as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. They dared not condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism; they remained silent and did not utter a single "no" about the Black Conference in Guam, which had just concluded two days before the opening of the bogus "Third Conference" and was convened by the U.S. to expand the Vietnam War; they actively advocated for the immediate cessation of bombing and "gradual escalation" on the Vietnam issue. In short, they were singing the same tune as their second-in-command Kosygin during his visit to Britain. That is: betraying the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people, serving the U.S. imperialists' "war to force surrender" and "bomb to force surrender" "peace" fraud, and closely coordinating with Brant's so-called "three-point proposal" and the bloodthirsty Black Conference in Guam. On the Palestinian issue, the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists was also fully exposed. Not only did they collude with the Indian representative to obstruct the conference from passing a resolution supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people, but they also shamelessly said: "We have not studied the Palestinian issue." The Soviet revisionists have torn off all their disguises with their own hands, further revealing to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world that their consistent political line of surrender is: to closely collude with U.S. imperialism, to kneel and surrender to U.S. imperialism, to run errands for U.S. imperialism, and to do everything possible to extinguish the blazing fires of the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people and the national revolutionary wars of the countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in a vain attempt to save the doomed fate of U.S. imperialism and the demise of the capitalist and imperialist system.

The Soviet representatives advocated the restoration of what they called the "traditions of Delhi, Tashkent, and Cairo," boasting that the bogus "Third Conference" was the "rebirth" of the Asian-African writers' movement, etc. This is the cunning trick of the Soviet revisionist traitors.

Throughout the history of the Asian-African writers' movement, there has never been an abstract, independent "tradition" of Delhi, Tashkent, and Cairo. What exists is the consistent struggle between two lines: the anti-imperialist revolutionary line that the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa have always adhered to, and the line of surrender that the Soviet revisionists have always promoted. The Asian-African writers' movement is part of the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Only by adhering to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line can the Asian-African writers' movement advance along the revolutionary path and promote the victory of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Conversely, if one accepts the line of surrender of the Soviet revisionists, it is a betrayal of the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The struggle between the two lines is a major issue concerning the direction, future, and fate of the Asian-African writers' movement. Therefore, to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism.

Since infiltrating the Asian-African writers' movement, the Soviet revisionists have been vigorously promoting their line of surrender, doing everything possible to control the Asian-African writers' movement from within, and trying to bring this movement onto the track of Soviet-American collusion. This line of surrender has always been firmly exposed and fought against by the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, suffering increasingly heavy defeats. Knowing that they have no way out, the Soviet revisionists brazenly carried out open splits, gathering a few lackeys and imperialist running dogs, deceiving some writers, and staging and directing the farce of the bogus "Third Conference." The so-called "rebirth" is merely a trick used by the Soviet revisionists to cover up their failure, playing the game of passing off counterfeit as genuine, attempting to use the name of the Asian-African writers' movement to carry out various illegal and treacherous acts. Clear-eyed people can see that the line of surrender of the Soviet revisionists has been spat upon by the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers and peoples of Asia and Africa, and the convening of the bogus "Third Conference" is a declaration of the complete bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionists' line of surrender.

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists have always adhered to a line of split in organization. They not only staged the bogus "Third Conference" but also concocted a so-called "Asian-African Writers Association," even putting China into their so-called "Executive Committee." The Soviet representatives shamelessly declared: "They believe that China's participation in the (bogus 'Third Conference') is necessary"; they said that "Chinese writers will one day participate in such a conference," etc. The Soviet revisionists thought that through such despicable means, they could give the bogus "Third Conference" and its bogus organizations a legal color, covering up their illegal nature; and they could also reverse black and white, putting the blame of split on China. We must solemnly warn the Soviet revisionist traitors: the so-called Asian-African writers' organizations and various conferences and activities that you manipulate are all completely illegal bogus organizations and bogus conferences, the products of your consistent lines of surrender and split. Your tricks in these bogus organizations, playing with the Chinese representative seats, are a shameless deception of the revolutionary and progressive writers and peoples of Asia and Africa, a great insult to all revolutionary Chinese writers and the Chinese people, and a new crime of your deliberate anti-China actions! We, all revolutionary Chinese writers, are determined to unite closely with the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, further expand and strengthen the international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, form a mighty anti-imperialist revolutionary army, smash all your plots of split and surrender, and carry the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa to the end!

Chairman Mao said: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason. As for the so-called 'love for humanity,' since the division of mankind into classes, there has never been such a unified love."

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists in the "general declaration" of the bogus "Third Conference" vigorously advocated the clich√©s of "unity and solidarity of humanity," "friendship," "brotherhood," "humanitarianism," etc. The Soviet representatives repeatedly emphasized that "literature and writers are the conscience, pain, anger, sorrow, and joy of their people"; that writers should express "the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and wishes of their fellow countrymen"; that the East and the West "have come together," and so on, ad infinitum. They erase class antagonisms, mix revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, aggressors and the aggressed, exploiters and the exploited, and announce that they have "common thoughts, feelings, hopes, and wishes," and should all be united according to the principles of "friendship," "brotherhood," "humanitarianism," etc., to achieve "unity and solidarity," to "unite the East and the West," etc. This is not a new invention of the Soviet revisionists but an old trick that has been passed down for generations by the apologists of capitalism and has long been bankrupt. The Soviet revisionists are merely at their wit's end, taking out this old junk from the "arsenal" of the exploiting classes, pasting a new "revisionist" label on it, and using it to cover up their sabotage of the Asian-African writers' movement and the betrayal of the revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

We ask the Soviet revisionist traitors: What point of your love and hatred is in common with the love and hatred of the revolutionary peoples of the world? You love the "free world" of the West, the rotten capitalist system, and the decadent and degenerate Western culture. You betray the interests of the peoples of the world and collude with the most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world, U.S. imperialism; you stage the farce of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut while holding the ninth American exhibition in Moscow's largest park, Sokolniki Park, to promote the so-called "material civilization" and "way of life" of the American bandits. What you love is exactly what we hate. We do not love the enemies of the people, we do not love U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and we do not love the social evils of the so-called "Western civilization." Our goal is to eliminate these things. You want to raise the black flag of "unity and solidarity of humanity" to "unite" the Asian-African writers' movement to your line of surrender, to "unite" it to your track of "Soviet-American cooperation, ruling the world"; to "unite" the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world to the so-called "free world family" of U.S. imperialism, that is completely a pipe dream. We, the revolutionary Chinese writers, will, together with the revolutionary and progressive writers of various Asian and African countries, resolutely pull down the black flag that the Soviet revisionist traitors have raised.

Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all cultures or literary arts belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel or independent of politics, do not exist in reality."

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists have always pretended to talk about literature and not politics. During the bogus "Third Conference," the Soviet representatives even publicly declared that they were only interested in literature and poetry, not politics. This is truly "admitting guilt without evidence."

What kind of literature are the Soviet revisionists interested in? It is literature that curses proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, literature that sings the praises of the gangster-in-chief of U.S. imperialism, literature that advocates war terror, peddles the philosophy of survival, and promotes the rotten lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, literature that corrupts and numbs the fighting will of the revolutionary peoples, literature that serves imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism. The Yevtushenko, who was hailed as a treasure by some people during the bogus "Third Conference," is a product of this kind of literature. In the Soviet Union, this kind of literature has long been rampant. The Soviet revisionists are eager to smuggle this kind of literature into the center of the national democratic revolutionary storm‚ÄîAsia and Africa. The revolutionary writers and peoples of the Asian and African countries know how to deal with it: resolutely resist and thoroughly criticize it, and throw this literature and its affiliated counter-revolutionary political line into the garbage heap of history.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general front of the revolution."

The revolutionary writers and peoples of Asia and Africa have always been very concerned about the development of Asian-African revolutionary literature. To create and develop the new culture and literature of the peoples of Asia and Africa that are anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and national, to sing the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa to maintain and safeguard national independence in a form that the masses love and appreciate, is our glorious task and the sacred mission entrusted to us by the peoples of Asia and Africa. Such literature openly declares its service to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa. It is a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. We, the revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa, are striving to create and develop such revolutionary literature.

Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

The Soviet representatives, who claim to be uninterested in politics, during the bogus "Third Conference," in addition to their activities of surrender and betrayal, also used every opportunity, inside and outside the conference, to slander and defame China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In fact, their anti-China clamor has long begun.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world were overjoyed and praised it. They knew that this great proletarian cultural revolution was related to the future of the Chinese revolution and also to the future of the world revolution. On the contrary, the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries all went into a hysterical frenzy. They mobilized all their propaganda machines, using every possible slander, defamation, and incitement, to launch a cacophony of anti-China hysteria.

After the modern revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the great October Revolution's homeland, the Soviet Party and state, they betrayed the Soviet people at home, carrying out a capitalist restoration; abroad, they betrayed the revolutionary peoples of the world, carrying out Soviet-American collusion, and promoting the line of surrender and split of counter-revolutionary revisionism everywhere. They have completely degenerated into the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Such a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration made the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries overjoyed. They day and night hoped that such a thing could be repeated in China.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, summing up the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship in China and internationally, personally initiated and led this great, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, pushing our country's socialist revolution to a new stage. The storm of the cultural revolution swept across the whole of China and shook the world. The broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, on the remnants of the exploiting class, and on the reactionary academic "authorities" who had been occupying our cultural positions. They dragged out the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road, China's Khrushchev, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, as well as the reactionary academic "authorities" who had been occupying our cultural positions. They thoroughly swept away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting class. Great Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly grasped by the broad masses. Tens of millions of revolutionary youths are growing up in the great waves of class struggle. The successors of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are emerging in batches. The situation in the literary circles of China is no exception. Those counter-revolutionary revisionists and various ghosts and monsters who had long been hiding in the literary ranks were all overthrown by the revolutionary masses. Their former prestige has been swept away. All revolutionary Chinese writers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly cleanse the filth of the bourgeois literary trends of the old era, thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, thoroughly clean up and reorganize their own ranks, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and resolutely implement the policy of literature serving proletarian politics, serving socialism, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They will strive to create a new proletarian literature of socialism. The domestic and foreign class enemies, who want to realize the dream of counter-revolutionary restoration in China, are desperately looking for their agents within the Chinese Communist Party, or pinning their hopes of "peaceful evolution" on the third and fourth generations of the Chinese Communist Party. The great proletarian cultural revolution has made all their dreams come to naught. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique feels that the cultural revolution will ignite the revolutionary fire in the hearts of the Soviet people, posing a threat to their survival, making their ruling throne shaky, and they may not be able to hold on until the next day. Such a cultural revolution could not fail to arouse their extreme hatred and fear, making them heartbroken and as if they had lost their parents!

Through the great proletarian cultural revolution, the people of our country will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the socialist revolution to the end, making our country an even more solid and powerful rear base for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and will always adhere to proletarian internationalism, fully supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. The cultural revolution has also created the most favorable conditions for the successful convening of the third Asian-African Writers Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing this year. All revolutionary Chinese writers are actively preparing to welcome the gathering of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa‚Äîthe third Asian-African Writers Conference. Looking back at our more than eight years of battle, and looking forward to the future of the Asian-African writers' movement, we see that our ranks are continuously expanding, our struggles are continuously winning, and we are filled with confidence. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely with the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, adhere to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line, and make the greatest contribution to promoting the Asian-African writers' movement, developing Asian-African revolutionary literature, and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa.
