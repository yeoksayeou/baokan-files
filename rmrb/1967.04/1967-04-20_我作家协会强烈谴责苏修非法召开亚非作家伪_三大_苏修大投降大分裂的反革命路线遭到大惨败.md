Chairman Mao said: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish always makes a final struggle against the revolutionary force."

The Chinese Writers Association today issued a statement titled "Great Surrender, Great Split, Great Exposure, Great Bankruptcy" regarding the bogus "Third Asian-African Writers Conference" held in Beirut. The full text is as follows:

The bogus "Third Asian-African Writers Conference," directed by the Soviet modern revisionists, was a complete failure from the beginning to the end in just five days. It was sternly condemned and exposed by the writers' organizations and nationalist parties of dozens of Asian and African countries. On March 29, after this bogus conference hastily concluded, the Soviet revisionists and their few followers, with swollen faces, tried to pass off their failure as a victory, attempting to deceive and mislead the public. However, those who know a little about the truth understand that this bogus conference was extremely chaotic and far from being respectable. The Soviet revisionists' line of surrender and split, which they have been vigorously promoting, has once again suffered a heavy defeat.

The Chinese Writers Association firmly supports the statement issued by the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau on April 13. This statement expresses the common stance of the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, and it is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists.

The sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, our great leader Chairman Mao, said: "The world is progressing, and the future is bright. This historical trend cannot be changed by anyone."

On the "stage" of the bogus "Third Conference," the Soviet representatives shamelessly exposed their ugly faces as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. They dared not condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism; they remained silent and did not utter a single "no" about the Black Conference in Guam, which had just concluded two days before the opening of the bogus "Third Conference" and was convened by the U.S. to expand the Vietnam War; they actively advocated for the immediate cessation of bombing and "gradual escalation" on the Vietnam issue. In short, they were singing the same tune as their second-in-command Kosygin during his visit to Britain. That is: betraying the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people, serving the U.S. imperialists' "war to force surrender" and "bomb to force surrender" "peace" fraud, and closely coordinating with Brant's so-called "three-point proposal" and the bloodthirsty Black Conference in Guam. On the Palestinian issue, the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists was also fully exposed. Not only did they collude with the Indian representative to obstruct the conference from passing a resolution supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people, but they also shamelessly said: "We have not studied the Palestinian issue." The Soviet revisionists have torn off all their disguises with their own hands, further revealing to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world that their consistent political line of surrender is: to closely collude with U.S. imperialism, to kneel and surrender to U.S. imperialism, to run errands for U.S. imperialism, and to do everything possible to extinguish the blazing fires of the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people and the national revolutionary wars of the countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in a vain attempt to save the doomed fate of U.S. imperialism and the demise of the capitalist and imperialist system.

The Soviet representatives advocated the restoration of what they called the "traditions of Delhi, Tashkent, and Cairo," boasting that the bogus "Third Conference" was the "rebirth" of the Asian-African writers' movement, etc. This is the cunning trick of the Soviet revisionist traitors.

Throughout the history of the Asian-African writers' movement, there has never been an abstract, independent "tradition" of Delhi, Tashkent, and Cairo. What exists is the consistent struggle between two lines: the anti-imperialist revolutionary line that the revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa have always adhered to, and the line of surrender that the Soviet revisionists have always promoted. The Asian-African writers' movement is part of the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Only by adhering to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line can the Asian-African writers' movement advance along the revolutionary path and promote the victory of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Conversely, if one accepts the line of surrender of the Soviet revisionists, it is a betrayal of the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The struggle between the two lines is a major issue concerning the direction, future, and fate of the Asian-African writers' movement. Therefore, to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism.

Since infiltrating the Asian-African writers' movement, the Soviet revisionists have been vigorously promoting their line of surrender, doing everything possible to control the Asian-African writers' movement from within, and trying to bring this movement onto the track of Soviet-American collusion. This line of surrender has always been firmly exposed and fought against by the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, suffering increasingly heavy defeats. Knowing that they have no way out, the Soviet revisionists brazenly carried out open splits, gathering a few lackeys and imperialist running dogs, deceiving some writers, and staging and directing the farce of the bogus "Third Conference." The so-called "rebirth" is merely a trick used by the Soviet revisionists to cover up their failure, playing the game of passing off counterfeit as genuine, attempting to use the name of the Asian-African writers' movement to carry out various illegal and treacherous acts. Clear-eyed people can see that the line of surrender of the Soviet revisionists has been spat upon by the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers and peoples of Asia and Africa, and the convening of the bogus "Third Conference" is a declaration of the complete bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionists' line of surrender.

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists have always adhered to a line of split in organization. They not only staged the bogus "Third Conference" but also concocted a so-called "Asian-African Writers Association," even putting China into their so-called "Executive Committee." The Soviet representatives shamelessly declared: "They believe that China's participation in the (bogus 'Third Conference') is necessary"; they said that "Chinese writers will one day participate in such a conference," etc. The Soviet revisionists thought that through such despicable means, they could give the bogus "Third Conference" and its bogus organizations a legal color, covering up their illegal nature; and they could also reverse black and white, putting the blame of split on China. We must solemnly warn the Soviet revisionist traitors: the so-called Asian-African writers' organizations and various conferences and activities that you manipulate are all completely illegal bogus organizations and bogus conferences, the products of your consistent lines of surrender and split. Your tricks in these bogus organizations, playing with the Chinese representative seats, are a shameless deception of the revolutionary and progressive writers and peoples of Asia and Africa, a great insult to all revolutionary Chinese writers and the Chinese people, and a new crime of your deliberate anti-China actions! We, all revolutionary Chinese writers, are determined to unite closely with the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, further expand and strengthen the international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, form a mighty anti-imperialist revolutionary army, smash all your plots of split and surrender, and carry the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa to the end!

Chairman Mao said: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason. As for the so-called 'love for humanity,' since the division of mankind into classes, there has never been such a unified love."

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists in the "general declaration" of the bogus "Third Conference" vigorously advocated the clichés of "unity and solidarity of humanity," "friendship," "brotherhood," "humanitarianism," etc. The Soviet representatives repeatedly emphasized that "literature and writers are the conscience, pain, anger, sorrow, and joy of their people"; that writers should express "the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and wishes of their fellow countrymen"; that the East and the West "have come together," and so on, ad infinitum. They erase class antagonisms, mix revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, aggressors and the aggressed, exploiters and the exploited, and announce that they have "common thoughts, feelings, hopes, and wishes," and should all be united according to the principles of "friendship," "brotherhood," "humanitarianism," etc., to achieve "unity and solidarity," to "unite the East and the West," etc. This is not a new invention of the Soviet revisionists but an old trick that has been passed down for generations by the apologists of capitalism and has long been bankrupt. The Soviet revisionists are merely at their wit's end, taking out this old junk from the "arsenal" of the exploiting classes, pasting a new "revisionist" label on it, and using it to cover up their sabotage of the Asian-African writers' movement and the betrayal of the revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

We ask the Soviet revisionist traitors: What point of your love and hatred is in common with the love and hatred of the revolutionary peoples of the world? You love the "free world" of the West, the rotten capitalist system, and the decadent and degenerate Western culture. You betray the interests of the peoples of the world and collude with the most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world, U.S. imperialism; you stage the farce of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut while holding the ninth American exhibition in Moscow's largest park, Sokolniki Park, to promote the so-called "material civilization" and "way of life" of the American bandits. What you love is exactly what we hate. We do not love the enemies of the people, we do not love U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and we do not love the social evils of the so-called "Western civilization." Our goal is to eliminate these things. You want to raise the black flag of "unity and solidarity of humanity" to "unite" the Asian-African writers' movement to your line of surrender, to "unite" it to your track of "Soviet-American cooperation, ruling the world"; to "unite" the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world to the so-called "free world family" of U.S. imperialism, that is completely a pipe dream. We, the revolutionary Chinese writers, will, together with the revolutionary and progressive writers of various Asian and African countries, resolutely pull down the black flag that the Soviet revisionist traitors have raised.

Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all cultures or literary arts belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel or independent of politics, do not exist in reality."

Driven by the need to promote their line of surrender, the Soviet revisionists have always pretended to talk about literature and not politics. During the bogus "Third Conference," the Soviet representatives even publicly declared that they were only interested in literature and poetry, not politics. This is truly "admitting guilt without evidence."

What kind of literature are the Soviet revisionists interested in? It is literature that curses proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, literature that sings the praises of the gangster-in-chief of U.S. imperialism, literature that advocates war terror, peddles the philosophy of survival, and promotes the rotten lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, literature that corrupts and numbs the fighting will of the revolutionary peoples, literature that serves imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism. The Yevtushenko, who was hailed as a treasure by some people during the bogus "Third Conference," is a product of this kind of literature. In the Soviet Union, this kind of literature has long been rampant. The Soviet revisionists are eager to smuggle this kind of literature into the center of the national democratic revolutionary storm—Asia and Africa. The revolutionary writers and peoples of the Asian and African countries know how to deal with it: resolutely resist and thoroughly criticize it, and throw this literature and its affiliated counter-revolutionary political line into the garbage heap of history.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general front of the revolution."

The revolutionary writers and peoples of Asia and Africa have always been very concerned about the development of Asian-African revolutionary literature. To create and develop the new culture and literature of the peoples of Asia and Africa that are anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and national, to sing the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa to maintain and safeguard national independence in a form that the masses love and appreciate, is our glorious task and the sacred mission entrusted to us by the peoples of Asia and Africa. Such literature openly declares its service to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa. It is a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. We, the revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa, are striving to create and develop such revolutionary literature.

Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

The Soviet representatives, who claim to be uninterested in politics, during the bogus "Third Conference," in addition to their activities of surrender and betrayal, also used every opportunity, inside and outside the conference, to slander and defame China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In fact, their anti-China clamor has long begun.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world were overjoyed and praised it. They knew that this great proletarian cultural revolution was related to the future of the Chinese revolution and also to the future of the world revolution. On the contrary, the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries all went into a hysterical frenzy. They mobilized all their propaganda machines, using every possible slander, defamation, and incitement, to launch a cacophony of anti-China hysteria.

After the modern revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the great October Revolution's homeland, the Soviet Party and state, they betrayed the Soviet people at home, carrying out a capitalist restoration; abroad, they betrayed the revolutionary peoples of the world, carrying out Soviet-American collusion, and promoting the line of surrender and split of counter-revolutionary revisionism everywhere. They have completely degenerated into the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Such a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration made the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries overjoyed. They day and night hoped that such a thing could be repeated in China.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, summing up the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship in China and internationally, personally initiated and led this great, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, pushing our country's socialist revolution to a new stage. The storm of the cultural revolution swept across the whole of China and shook the world. The broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, on the remnants of the exploiting class, and on the reactionary academic "authorities" who had been occupying our cultural positions. They dragged out the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road, China's Khrushchev, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, as well as the reactionary academic "authorities" who had been occupying our cultural positions. They thoroughly swept away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting class. Great Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly grasped by the broad masses. Tens of millions of revolutionary youths are growing up in the great waves of class struggle. The successors of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are emerging in batches. The situation in the literary circles of China is no exception. Those counter-revolutionary revisionists and various ghosts and monsters who had long been hiding in the literary ranks were all overthrown by the revolutionary masses. Their former prestige has been swept away. All revolutionary Chinese writers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly cleanse the filth of the bourgeois literary trends of the old era, thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, thoroughly clean up and reorganize their own ranks, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and resolutely implement the policy of literature serving proletarian politics, serving socialism, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They will strive to create a new proletarian literature of socialism. The domestic and foreign class enemies, who want to realize the dream of counter-revolutionary restoration in China, are desperately looking for their agents within the Chinese Communist Party, or pinning their hopes of "peaceful evolution" on the third and fourth generations of the Chinese Communist Party. The great proletarian cultural revolution has made all their dreams come to naught. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique feels that the cultural revolution will ignite the revolutionary fire in the hearts of the Soviet people, posing a threat to their survival, making their ruling throne shaky, and they may not be able to hold on until the next day. Such a cultural revolution could not fail to arouse their extreme hatred and fear, making them heartbroken and as if they had lost their parents!

Through the great proletarian cultural revolution, the people of our country will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the socialist revolution to the end, making our country an even more solid and powerful rear base for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and will always adhere to proletarian internationalism, fully supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. The cultural revolution has also created the most favorable conditions for the successful convening of the third Asian-African Writers Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing this year. All revolutionary Chinese writers are actively preparing to welcome the gathering of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa—the third Asian-African Writers Conference. Looking back at our more than eight years of battle, and looking forward to the future of the Asian-African writers' movement, we see that our ranks are continuously expanding, our struggles are continuously winning, and we are filled with confidence. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely with the broad masses of revolutionary and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, adhere to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line, and make the greatest contribution to promoting the Asian-African writers' movement, developing Asian-African revolutionary literature, and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

### 我作家协会强烈谴责苏修非法召开亚非作家伪“三大”  苏修大投降大分裂的反革命路线遭到大惨败

    毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    我作家协会强烈谴责苏修非法召开亚非作家伪“三大”
    苏修大投降大分裂的反革命路线遭到大惨败
    新华社十九日讯　中国作家协会今天发表题为《大投降，大分裂，大暴露，大破产》的关于贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的声明。全文如下：
    由苏联现代修正主义者一手导演的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，从开场到收场的短短五天当中，遭到了几十个亚非国家的作家组织和民族主义政党义正词严的谴责和揭露，三月二十九日，这个伪会草草收场之后，苏修及其一小撮追随者，打肿脸充胖子，硬把自己的失败当作胜利来吹嘘，企图迷惑视听，掩人耳目。然而，稍稍了解一点真相的人都知道，这个伪会开得十分混乱，十分不象样子。苏修所极力推行的投降主义、分裂主义的反革命路线，又一次遭到了惨重的失败。
    中国作家协会坚决支持亚非作家常设局四月十三日的声明，这个声明表达了亚非广大革命、进步作家的共同立场，是对苏修的沉重打击。
    世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”
    在伪“三大”的“舞台”上，苏修代表毫不掩饰地暴露了他们充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。他们不敢谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行；他们对于在伪“三大”开幕前两天刚刚闭幕的、美帝为扩大侵越战争而召开的关岛黑会，装聋作哑，不肯说一个“不”字；他们在越南问题上，积极鼓吹什么立即停止轰炸和“逐步升级”。总之，是和他们的二号头目柯西金在访问英国期间唱的完全是一个调子。那就是：出卖越南人民的反美救国斗争，为美帝“以战迫降”、“以炸压降”的“和谈”骗局效劳，和吴丹的所谓“三点建议”，和杀气腾腾的关岛黑会紧密配合，互相呼应。在巴勒斯坦问题上，苏修的叛徒面目也同样暴露无遗。它不仅伙同印度代表竭力阻挠会议通过支持巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的决议，甚至恬不知耻地说：他们对巴勒斯坦问题“没有研究”。苏修用它自己的手，扯下了它自己的一切伪装，从而进一步向亚非人民和世界人民表明：和美帝加紧勾结，向美帝屈膝投降，为美帝奔走效劳，千方百计扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族革命战争的熊熊烈火，妄图挽救美帝国主义最后失败的命运，挽救资本主义和帝国主义制度的灭亡，这是苏修一贯奉行的投降主义的政治路线。
    苏修代表鼓吹要恢复什么“德里、塔什干和开罗的传统”，吹嘘伪“三大”是什么亚非作家运动的“新生”等等，这是苏修叛徒们别有用心的骗术。
    在亚非作家运动的全部历史中，从来不存在什么抽象的、独立自在的所谓“德里、塔什干和开罗的传统”之类的神物，这里有的是贯彻始终的两条路线的斗争，那就是广大革命、进步的亚非作家始终坚持执行的反帝革命路线，同苏修一贯推行的投降主义路线的斗争。
    亚非作家运动，是亚非人民反帝革命事业的一部分。只有坚持执行反帝革命路线，才能保证亚非作家运动沿着革命的道路前进，才能促进亚非人民反帝革命斗争的胜利。反之，如果接受苏修的投降主义路线，那就是对亚非人民反帝革命事业的背叛。两条路线的斗争，是关系到亚非作家运动的方向、前途和命运的大事。因此，反帝必须反修。
    苏修从混进亚非作家运动之日起，就极力推行它的投降主义路线，千方百计地从内部控制亚非作家运动，一心把这个运动纳入苏美勾结的轨道。这条投降主义路线，一直受到广大亚非革命、进步作家的坚决揭露和斗争，遭到愈来愈惨重的失败。苏修自知走投无路，便悍然实行公开分裂，拼凑起一些仆从和帝国主义的走狗，拉拢了一些受蒙蔽的作家，策划和导演了伪“三大”的丑剧。所谓“新生”云云，只不过是苏修用以掩盖它的失败，玩弄鱼目混珠的骗术，妄图冒亚非作家运动之名，进行种种投降、背叛的非法勾当而已。明眼人一看便知，苏修的投降主义路线，已为广大革命的亚非作家和人民所唾弃，伪“三大”的召开，正是宣告苏修投降主义路线彻底破产。
    苏修从推行投降主义路线的需要出发，在组织上，一贯奉行着一条分裂主义的路线。他们不仅策划了伪“三大”，还拼凑出一个所谓“亚非作家协会”，甚至把中国选进它的所谓“执行委员会”中去。苏修代表厚颜无耻地宣称：他们“认为中国参加（伪“三大”）大会是必要的”；说什么“中国作家们将来会有一天要参加这样的会议的”，等等。苏修以为通过这种卑劣的手法，既可以给伪“三大”及其伪组织涂上一层合法的色彩，借以掩盖其非法的性质；又可以颠倒黑白，把分裂主义的罪名强加到中国头上。我们要严正警告苏修叛徒们：你们所操纵的所谓亚非作家组织及其串演的各种会议活动，都是完全非法的伪组织、伪会议，是你们一贯奉行的投降主义、分裂主义路线的产物。你们在这种伪组织里，玩弄中国代表席位之类的阴谋，是对亚非革命、进步作家和亚非人民的无耻欺骗，是对全体中国革命作家和中国人民的极大侮辱，是你们蓄意反华的新罪证！我们全体中国的革命作家，决心和广大革命、进步的亚非作家紧紧团结在一起，进一步扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线，组成浩浩荡荡的反帝革命大军，粉碎你们的一切分裂主义、投降主义的阴谋，把亚非人民的革命斗争事业进行到底！
    毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。至于所谓‘人类之爱’，自从人类分化成为阶级以后，就没有过这种统一的爱。”
    苏修从推行投降主义路线的需要出发，在伪“三大”的“总宣言”里，大肆鼓吹什么“人类的团结和统一”、“友爱”、
  “博爱”、“人道主义”之类的滥调。苏修代表不遗余力地一再宣扬什么“文学与作家就是他的人民的良知、痛苦、愤怒、哀伤和欢乐”呀，什么作家要表达“他们的同胞的思想、感情、希望和愿望”呀，什么东方和西方“已经合到一起了”呀，如此等等，不一而足。抹杀阶级的对立，把革命和反革命、侵略者和被侵略者、剥削者和被剥削者混同起来，宣布他们有“共同的思想、感情、希望和愿望”，应当一律按照“友爱”、“博爱”、“人道主义”之类的原则，实行“团结和统一”，把“东方和西方合到一起”，这一套，并不是苏修的新发明，而是资本主义辩护士们世代相传而又早已破产了的老把戏。苏修不过是黔驴技穷，从剥削阶级的“武器库”里重新搬出这套破烂货，贴上“修记”新商标，拿来为他破坏亚非作家运动、出卖亚非人民革命事业作掩护而已。
    试问苏修叛徒们：你们的爱憎同世界革命人民的爱憎，有哪一点相通的呢？你们爱的是西方“自由世界”，是腐朽的资本主义制度和没落、颓废的西方文化。你们背叛世界人民利益，和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义勾勾搭搭；你们一面在贝鲁特串演伪“三大”的丑剧，一面在莫斯科最大的公园之一——索科尔尼基公园举办第九次美国展览会，宣扬美国强盗的所谓“物质文明”和“生活方式”。你们之所爱，正是我们之所恨。我们决不爱人民的敌人，决不爱美帝国主义和各国反动派，决不爱所谓“西方文明”之类的社会丑恶现象，我们的目的是要消灭这些东西。你们妄想打起“人类的团结和统一”这面黑旗，把亚非作家运动“统一”到你们的投降主义路线上去，统一到你们“美苏合作，主宰世界”的轨道上去；把亚非各国和全世界的革命人民“统一”到美帝国主义的所谓“自由世界大家庭”中去，那完全是白日作梦。我们革命的中国作家，将和亚非各国的革命、进步作家一起，坚决拔掉苏修叛徒打起的这面黑旗。
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    苏修从推行投降主义路线的需要出发，一贯打着谈文学不谈政治的幌子。在伪“三大”期间，苏修代表竟公然宣称：他们所感兴趣的只是文学和诗歌而不是政治。这真是“此地无银三百两”。
    苏修所感兴趣的，究竟是什么样的文学呢？那就是咒骂无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的文学，是为美帝国主义强盗头子歌功颂德的文学，是宣扬战争恐怖、贩卖活命哲学、鼓吹腐烂透顶的资产阶级生活方式的文学，是腐蚀和麻痹革命人民斗争意志的文学，是为帝国主义、资本主义、修正主义服务的文学。在伪“三大”被某些人前呼后拥、奉为至宝的那位叶夫图申科，就是靠这种文学起家的。在苏联，这种文学早已泛滥成灾。苏修急不可耐地要把这种文学运销到民族民主革命风暴的中心——亚非地区，亚非各国革命的作家和人民是懂得应当怎样对待它的，那就是：坚决抵制，彻底批判，把这种文学和它所属的反革命政治路线，一起扫进历史的垃圾堆里去。
    毛主席说：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”
    革命的亚非作家和人民，对于发展亚非革命文学，从来是十分关切的。创造和发展亚非反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新文艺，用群众喜闻乐见的民族形式歌颂亚非人民争取与维护民族独立的革命斗争，这是我们亚非革命作家的光荣任务，是亚非人民赋予我们的崇高使命。这样的文学，公开申明为亚非人民反帝革命斗争服务，它是团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。我们亚非革命作家，正在为创造和发展这样的革命文学而努力奋斗。
    毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    自称对政治不感兴趣的苏修代表，在伪“三大”期间，除了大搞其投降背叛活动而外，还利用一切机会，在会内会外，对中国的无产阶级文化大革命运动进行肆意的诋毁和诬蔑。其实，他们的这种反华叫嚣，是早就开始了的。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命运动兴起以后，全世界的马克思列宁主义者以及全世界的革命人民，无不为之欢欣鼓舞，称颂赞扬。他们知道，这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，关系到中国革命的前途，也关系到世界革命的前途。与此相反，以美国为首的帝国主义者，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派，则一齐歇斯底里大发作，它们开动一切宣传机器，用尽种种诽谤、诬蔑和挑拨的伎俩，掀起一片声嘶力竭的反华大合唱。
    修正主义集团篡夺了伟大十月革命的故乡苏联党和国家的领导之后，在国内他们背叛苏联人民，大搞资本主义复辟；在国外，他们背叛世界革命人民，大搞苏美勾结，到处推行投降主义、分裂主义的反革命修正主义路线。完全堕落成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。这样的资本主义反革命复辟，使帝国主义和各国反动派兴高采烈，他们日夜盼望着这样的事情能够在中国重演。
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，总结了中国和国际的无产阶级专政的历史经验，亲自发动和领导了这场伟大的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把我国社会主义革命推进到一个新阶段。文化革命的风暴，席卷了全中国，震动了全世界。广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、向剥削阶级遗留下来的残渣余孽，发动了猛烈的进攻。把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫，以及党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把霸占着我们的文化阵地的资产阶级反动学术“权威”统统揪了出来。把剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，打得个落花流水。伟大的毛泽东思想，日益为广大群众所掌握。千百万革命小将，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在成批涌现。中国文学界的情况也不例外，那些长期隐藏在文学队伍中的反革命修正主义分子和各种牛鬼蛇神，被革命群众纷纷打倒在地。他们昔日的威风，扫地以尽。全体革命的中国作家，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的方向，荡涤一切旧时代资产阶级文艺思潮的污浊，彻底铲除反革命修正主义文艺黑线，彻底清理和重新组织自己的队伍，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决贯彻文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义服务、为工农兵服务的方针，为创造社会主义的无产阶级新文学而努力奋斗。国内外的阶级敌人，一心想在中国实现反革命复辟的美梦，竭力从中国党内寻找他们的代理人，或者把“和平演变”的希望，寄托在中国党的第三代第四代身上。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使他们的种种幻梦，一齐宣告破灭。苏联修正主义领导集团，更感到文化大革命将会燃起苏联人民心中的革命之火，将会危及他们的生存，使他们的统治宝座岌岌可危，朝不保夕。这样的文化大革命怎能不引起他们的无比仇恨和恐惧、又怎能不使他们痛心疾首、如丧考妣呢！
    经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，我国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命进行到底，使我国成为各国人民革命斗争的更加巩固和强大的后方，将永远坚持无产阶级国际主义，全力支持亚非和世界各国人民的革命斗争。文化大革命也为已确定今年在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会的胜利召开，创造了最有利的条件。全体革命的中国作家，正为迎接亚非革命、进步作家的大会师——第三届亚非作家大会，积极进行准备。回顾我们八年多来的战斗历程，展望亚非作家运动的未来，看到我们的队伍不断壮大，我们的斗争不断胜利，我们感到信心百倍。我们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和广大的亚非革命、进步作家进一步团结起来，坚持反帝革命路线，为促进亚非作家运动、发展亚非革命文学，为亚非人民的反帝革命斗争，作出最大的贡献。
              一九六七年四月十九日
