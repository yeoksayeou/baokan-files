The Ministry of National Defense recently issued an order, conferring the honorable title of "Model Political Border Unit" on the Third Company of a certain unit of the Kunming-based People's Liberation Army.

The order states that the Third Company, while stationed in border regions, has undertaken the arduous tasks of fighting the enemy, defending the border, and engaging in minority nationality work and border construction. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and insisted on building the army with Mao Zedong Thought. They have focused on transforming worldviews, promoting the thought revolution within the unit, and firmly establishing the idea of treating the border as home, honoring hardship, and long-term border defense and construction. In the sharp and complex class struggle, the entire company has been clear in their love and hate, steadfast in their stance, and bravely engaged in uncompromising struggle against the enemy. They have withstood the infiltration of various "fragrant winds" and vulgar customs from society, making good deeds prevalent. In the work of defending and constructing the border, the Third Company has resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee and Central Military Commission's policy of politically building the border. They have fully mobilized the masses, trusted the masses, relied on the masses, united with brotherly nationalities, firmly grasped the class line and class struggle, and actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. They have armed the brotherly nationalities with Mao Zedong Thought, making it deeply rooted among them, and fundamentally raising the masses' awareness. The soldiers of the Third Company have also assisted the local government in social reforms, focused on the implementation of the militia's three guarantees, cultivated a batch of cadres for building a new socialist border, helped brotherly nationalities develop collective economies, significantly improved the masses' lives, established a solid military-civilian joint defense, and foiled various plots and sabotage activities by class enemies. They have built the border into a strong red outpost fortress.

The Ministry of National Defense, in its order, hopes that the comrades of the Third Company will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, maintain their honor, carry forward their honor, never be complacent, and always move forward. The order also calls on all military units, especially coastal defense and border defense units, to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Third Company, faithfully implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on strengthening political borders, strengthen coastal and border defenses, do a good job in minority nationality work, strengthen military-civilian relations, and build a solid military-civilian joint defense. They should turn our defense line into a true iron wall.
