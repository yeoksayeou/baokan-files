The publication of Comrade Chi Bǎnyǔ's article "Patriotism or Treason? — A Critique of the Reactionary Film 'The Last Emperor'" has great political significance at this moment. It marks the beginning of a new phase in the mass struggle to overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the party and is a new call to arms for the current proletarian cultural revolution.

This article raises the banner of revolutionary criticism, exposing the true face of the top capitalist-roader in the party, who pretends to be anti-imperialist but is actually a traitor, who pretends to be revolutionary but is actually a sellout.

This article raises the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, providing a profound analysis of the long-standing bourgeois reactionary line, and launching a full-scale attack on the top capitalist-roader in the party who proposed and promoted this reactionary line.

This article is filled with revolutionary fighting spirit, expressing the will and determination of the people of the entire country to love Mao Zedong Thought, to eradicate revisionism, and to overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev.

The new battle cry has been sounded. We must immediately take action, with a fighting posture and unyielding heroic spirit, raising the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching the most ferocious attack on a handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists and their top capitalist-roader in the party, thoroughly overthrowing, smashing, and exposing them!

I. How the Reactionary Film "The Last Emperor" Came to Be

"The Last Emperor" was produced by the Hong Kong Yǒnghuá Film Company. The owner of Yǒnghuá, who was also the producer of "The Last Emperor," Li Zǔyǒng, was a war profiteer and a speculator in gold during the Anti-Japanese War. He once publicly declared that his company "could not be used by the Communists." The consultant for Yǒnghuá was a notorious collaborator who openly surrendered to the Japanese during the Anti-Japanese War. This is a thoroughly reactionary film company established to serve the dying struggles of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1948, the first film it produced was the poisonous weed "National Soul," which distorted history to promote the idea of loyalty to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Therefore, "National Soul" was praised by the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered a large number of copies to be printed and distributed to the front lines for screening, "to promote the spirit of national defense and boost morale." The second film produced by this company was the treasonous "The Last Emperor." The scriptwriter was a collaborator named Yáo Kè. "The Last Emperor" was thus produced by this group of ghosts and demons.

"The Last Emperor" was produced on the eve of national liberation, around the time the U.S. State Department issued the "White Paper on Sino-American Relations." "The Last Emperor" and the U.S. White Paper are in the same tune, distorting and fabricating history, filled with malicious slander and deep hatred for the Chinese people. This film met the needs of the imperialists and their running dogs for a counterrevolutionary restoration. It used the method of allegory to place the hope of changing the sky on a group of so-called "new faction" intellectuals. The "new faction" in the film is the "democratic individualists" mentioned in the White Paper. The film vigorously promotes the idea of using these "new faction" figures, with the support of imperialism, to help the failed "emperor" "restore the throne and revive the dynasty." "The Last Emperor" uses various methods to spread illusions about imperialism, covering up the essence of imperialist aggression, and promoting the slave mentality of kneeling and surrendering to imperialism. This is a thoroughly reactionary film serving American imperialism and its running dogs.

In March 1950, this thoroughly reactionary film was screened nationwide. This was a serious class struggle! It was the first mad attack by the class enemy in the ideological realm on the young proletarian dictatorship, the first and most serious challenge to the young proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao solemnly pointed out: "The Last Emperor" is a treasonous film and should be criticized.

At that time, Comrade Jiang Qing, who served as a member of the Film Industry Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Culture, insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and repeatedly proposed to firmly criticize "The Last Emperor." She engaged in a sharp struggle with the counterrevolutionary revisionists Lù Dìngyī, Zhōu Yáng, and the then Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, Hú ××, who praised the film and obstructed the criticism.

Some audience members also resisted and criticized the film after watching it, pointing out that the film "blurred and poisoned the class consciousness of the audience" and "completely distorted Chinese history."

The criticism of this reactionary film stung the top capitalist-roader in the party and his loyal followers, who immediately jumped out to obstruct it. They praised the poisonous weed as a fragrant flower, even praising this treasonous film as "patriotic." Once the tone was set, the sycophants enthusiastically praised it. They said that the faction represented by Guangxu reflected the thoughts of the emerging and budding bourgeoisie, accepting capitalist "civilization" to a certain extent, aiming to catch up and strengthen the country. They even said that Guangxu was an emperor with patriotic thoughts. Thus, newspapers advertised it extensively, using extremely flattering language to promote "the greatness of this film," "the astonishing plot," and calling on "those who have not seen it to hurry up and see it! Those who have seen it should see it again, because it is a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece, those who have not seen it should not miss this opportunity!" Wave after wave of hawking, wave after wave of praise, the treasonous film was crowned with the laurel of patriotism. The criticism of this film was thus strangled in its cradle.

The "big shot" who strangled this criticism is the top capitalist-roader in the party who is trying to strangle the current proletarian cultural revolution. It is he who, in collusion with another top capitalist-roader in the party, proposed and promoted a bourgeois reactionary line, "striking a large number and protecting a small number," ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, and using every means to shield the capitalist-roaders in power. This "big shot" representing the interests of the bourgeoisie has become a protective umbrella for all ghosts and demons. In every major struggle since the founding of the country, he has played this shameful role.

II. Thoroughly Treasonous

The reactionary film "The Last Emperor" is clearly a thoroughly treasonous film, but the top capitalist-roader in the party calls it "patriotic," completely reversing black and white.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The specific content of patriotism is determined by the historical conditions under which it is found. There is the patriotism of the Japanese invaders and Hitler, and there is our patriotism." When talking about patriotism, Chairman Mao also pointed out: "Our slogan is to defend the motherland and fight against aggression." The top capitalist-roader in the party, however, sings the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's teachings, saying that "true patriotism is the love for the thousands of years of tradition passed down from generation to generation, for one's own country, one's own people, one's own language and writing, and for the excellent traditions of one's own nation." This is sheer nonsense! It completely removes the revolutionary content of defending the motherland and fighting against aggression, completely removing the content of class struggle. It is this "inventor" of "patriotism" who even thinks that those who joined the Maintenance Association during the Anti-Japanese War cannot be considered traitors, because "some people joined the Maintenance Association out of coercion, and some mainly to protect their own lives and property." Someone "reported the actions of the guerrilla forces to the Japanese," that was "because of the oppression of the Japanese devils," "the guerrilla forces should also understand." Enough, enough! His so-called "true patriotism" is thoroughly treasonous! It is this "inventor" of "patriotism" who vigorously beautifies and praises foreign bourgeoisie. In October 1963, he shamelessly praised the Meiji Restoration for cultivating "that kind of spirit of vigor and striving for strength in the Japanese bourgeoisie," and said, "Germany was also bullied in the past, and later had that spirit, the iron-blooded chancellor Bismarck advocated." He also said: "We have been defeated for more than a hundred years, so we think the Chinese are no good, losing confidence in ourselves, saying that Westerners are good, and the Chinese are not. Later, we learned from the Westerners, and as soon as we learned, we made progress." His servile attitude towards Western capitalist countries is evident. What "country" does he love? He loves the country of the landlords and bourgeoisie, and he dreams of realizing a counterrevolutionary restoration in China. No wonder he praises a treasonous film as a "patriotic" film!

In contemporary times, the attitude towards imperialism is the touchstone for distinguishing patriotism from treason.

In his brilliant work "Throw Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," Chairman Mao deeply analyzes the nature of American imperialism, pointing out that some people "have illusions about the United States," and calls for throwing away illusions and preparing for struggle. Chairman Mao says: "The slogan of 'preparing for struggle' is directed at those who still have some illusions about the relationship between China and imperialist countries, especially the relationship between China and the United States. They are still passive on this issue, have not made up their minds, and have not decided to fight a long-term struggle against American imperialism (and British imperialism), because they still have illusions about the United States." "The Last Emperor" opposes Chairman Mao's great call, blatantly spreading illusions about imperialism. The praiser of "The Last Emperor," the Chinese Khrushchev, is the number one figure spreading illusions about imperialism. After 1956, even in 1963, he said: "There are also some people in the American ruling class with clearer heads who gradually realize that the war policy may not be beneficial to the United States." This is a thoroughly cowardly, anti-revolutionary, and surrendering to imperialism counterrevolutionary fallacy!

In "The Last Emperor," imperialism is not the aggressor trying to turn China into its colony, but the "friend" helping China to carry out reforms and supporting China to take the "path to prosperity." Turning "aggression" into "friendship" is precisely the trick of the American White Paper. Just a few months after the screening of "The Last Emperor," the top capitalist-roader in the party, at a university's opening ceremony, actually praised the cultural aggression of imperialism as having "great achievements in raising the cultural level of the Chinese people." This is blatantly praising the aggression of imperialism against China, which is intolerable!

"The Last Emperor" also praises Western guns, Western schools, and Western learning through the mouths of the "new faction" characters, aiming to create a superstition about Western bourgeois civilization in the minds of the Chinese people. It is nothing but saying that the Chinese are no good at this and that, worse than the West in the past, and even worse now, so kneel down and beg. How shameless! The Chinese people have dignity and will not listen to this. We have the great ambition of the proletariat, daring to take paths that others have not taken, daring to climb peaks that others have not climbed. All the nonsense of worshipping the West, go to hell! In the early days of the founding of the country, there was a serious worship of the United States, fear of the United States, and flattery of the United States among some people. The party and the government, in order to eliminate its poison, carried out large-scale ideological education. At this time, "The Last Emperor" was screened, singing the opposite tune, spreading poison, and praising everything foreign as good. This was conducting slave education among the masses, spreading the slave mentality of worshipping "foreigners." "The Last Emperor" stopped screening, but the top capitalist-roader in the party did not stop the reactionary propaganda of "worshipping the West and denigrating China." What "foreigners" eat little grain, grain is used to feed livestock, people mainly eat meat and milk, what imperialist trusts, American education system, etc., he praised and praised. He openly advocated that "capitalist countries" have "several hundred years of experience," "capitalists, those who have run foreign companies, those who have been compradors, they have experience," and cursed our cadres for not being good at learning from foreign bourgeoisie. He is truly a thorough traitor!

Exaggerating the strength of imperialism and promoting the theory of national extinction is a particularly prominent reactionary content of the film "The Last Emperor." The film vigorously promotes the idea of fearing imperialism, saying things like "killing foreigners is absolutely not allowed," "the few against the many, the strong against the weak, we will surely be defeated." The emperor Guangxu, who was praised as a "patriotic" emperor, sang the highest tune of national extinction. Before the battle, he said: "We will surely be defeated," "one day they will attack Beijing," "in the future, China will surely be divided." The empress Cixi, who was portrayed as a patriotic hero, also spoke of national extinction. She said: "Although Japan is small, it is now rich and strong, we may not be able to defeat them." Exaggerating the strength of imperialism and blatantly promoting the theory of national extinction is thorough treason! The top capitalist-roader in the party is also a blower of the strength of imperialism. In 1965, he shamelessly promoted "the United States is a powerful country, the most powerful country in the world." Isn't this the same tone as Guangxu and others? This is the language of a slave, the tone of an imperialist running dog!

The promoters of treason must viciously slander and attack patriots. The Boxers were true patriots, embodying the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people's tenacious resistance against imperialist aggression. "The Last Emperor," however, uses despicable methods to viciously slander the Boxers. The first scene is "the Boxers with torches, rampaging through the crowd like wolves and pigs." The film slanders the Boxers as ignorant and stupid, a mob, a disorderly crowd, killing and burning, looting, in short, a group of "mad as demons," ten evil people. Especially infuriating is the scene at the altar, which goes to great lengths to vilify, almost portraying the Boxers as mad ghosts. Anyone standing on the revolutionary side, watching this scene, will feel indignant and unable to watch. If you praise it, it means you are praising the slander of imperialism against the Chinese people, praising the aggression of imperialism against China. If you praise it as patriotic, it means you love imperialism.

The film portrays the Boxers as "killing and burning," "mad as demongs," and its praisers are not on the same side, portraying the scattered, conservative, narrow-minded, backward, and private nature of the peasant class. In the film, Weng Tonghe says: "The common people are the most obedient and also the easiest to satisfy." This represents the universal view of all officials, and this is not in harmony with the praisers of the film, the top capitalist-roader in the party who is an official, looking at the masses as a fool, and looking at themselves as Zhuge Liang, is it not in harmony?

Everything promoted by the film is also everything loved by its praisers, everything hidden in their souls. The film praises bourgeois reformism, advocates learning from the West, spreads illusions about imperialism, exaggerates the strength of the enemy, surrenders to the pressure of imperialism, vigorously promotes the theory of national extinction, viciously slanders anti-imperialist struggles, and extremely hates the masses. All these thoroughly reactionary things are the so-called "patriotism" of the top capitalist-roader in the party!

III. The Political Purpose of Praising the Reactionary Film "The Last Emperor"

"The Last Emperor" meets the needs of American imperialism's aggression against China, promoting the policy of imperialism to support running dogs against revolutionary people. The film madly calls for the "emperor to stand up and clean up the mess," relying on "foreigners" to come in and "help the emperor restore the throne and revive the dynasty." What is called for here is not the admission of the American White Paper that "only with American military force can the Communists be driven away"? Is this not calling for the organization of the "American Fifth Column"? Is this not promoting the aggressive war of the United States providing money and guns, and Chiang Kai-shek providing people, fighting for the United States, killing Chinese people? Who is the "emperor" who relies on the help of "foreigners" and tries to "revive the dynasty"? It is Guangxu on the screen, Chiang Kai-shek in reality. According to the description in the film, this "emperor" fled in the situation of "the Boxers burning and looting everywhere, very chaotic." However, the common people support this fleeing emperor, "the officials and gentry of the Yangtze River and the south, all support him, and the envoys of various countries also support the emperor."

Look at the last few scenes of the film:

Villager: Here, we heard that the emperor fled, so we brought some food to offer to the emperor.
Guangxu: Now it's chaotic, don't you hate the emperor?
Villager: Amen, the emperor is a good emperor, he helps us common people. ...
Villager: Yes, yes, we are all thinking of the emperor! We thought the emperor might be hungry on the way, so we cooked a few eggs and made a few flatbreads to give to the emperor to eat.
Guangxu: (moved) It's hard for you to be so loyal ...

At the end of the film, the villagers all kneel down, shouting "Long live the emperor!" The carriage passes in front of the villagers, Guangxu smiles, eats the flatbread given by the villagers, and nods to say goodbye. The crowd kneels and sends him off, and the carriage gradually disappears into the distance.

The author Yao Ke so flatteringly beautifies a feudal emperor, giving him a radiant halo, obviously standing on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries, encouraging the doomed Chiang Kai-shek clique to fail again and come back, to rise from the ashes.

Strangely, those who wear the "Communist Party member" and "proletarian revolutionary" cloaks, and speak Marxist-Leninist phrases, the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and several Deputy Ministers, as well as the top capitalist-roader in the party who supports them from behind, are very fond of such a reactionary film. They shamelessly praise and vigorously promote it, but why?

This film was produced in 1948 and screened in 1950. In 1948, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the situation of the War of Liberation had entered a new turning point. The People's Liberation Army not only had the advantage in quality but also in quantity. The reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in China was rapidly collapsing, and a new China led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants was about to be born. In 1950, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle of the Chinese people had achieved victory, and the new China, like a rising sun, shone its brilliant light over the world, entering a new stage of socialist revolution.

Where will the new China go? Will it take the socialist road or the capitalist road? To whom will the fruits of revolutionary victory belong? The proletariat or the bourgeoisie? These two questions were sharply posed before the Chinese people. The bourgeoisie and their representatives attempted to seize the fruits of revolutionary victory for themselves, pulling China onto the capitalist road, and realizing a counterrevolutionary restoration in the new China. The reactionary film "The Last Emperor" precisely met their political needs.

The film, centered on the struggle between the imperial and empress factions, vigorously promotes bourgeois reformism. It says things like "if China wants to be rich and strong, it must carry out reforms!" "China can reform like this, in less than thirty years, it can become the richest and strongest country in the world!" "Without reform, it is not enough to save China." The so-called reform, the so-called change, is to promote learning from the West, to promote using reformist methods to take the capitalist road. Learn from the West? Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialist aggression shattered the Chinese people's dream of learning from the West." Take the capitalist road? This is the road of treason, the road of burying the fruits of revolutionary victory. The road promoted by "The Last Emperor" is precisely such a road; the road pursued by a handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party is also precisely such a road. In the 1950s, when the Chinese people entered the era of socialist revolution, promoting that capitalism can save China is a thorough counterrevolutionary propaganda.

Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The civilization of the Western bourgeoisie, bourgeois democracy, and the plan for a bourgeois republic have all been bankrupted in the eyes of the Chinese people." "Kang Youwei wrote 'The Book of Great Harmony,' but he did not and could not find a way to reach the Great Harmony." The top capitalist-roader in the party opposed Chairman Mao's teachings, eager to learn from the West, determined to take the capitalist road. His soul is deeply rooted in an unworkable bourgeois republic. What he longs for and what "The Last Emperor" promotes are precisely in tune, in the same vein.

The wheel of history always moves forward against the wishes of the reactionaries. The top capitalist-roader in the party, every time at the critical moment of the revolution, on every key issue, he always jumps out, struggles with the wheel of history, trying to stop the wheel of history from moving forward. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he proposed the "peaceful democratic new stage," opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "fighting to the end, inch by inch, the enemy is sharpening his knife, and we must also sharpen our knife." In 1948, when the country was about to be liberated, Chairman Mao pointed out that the progress of the war was much faster than originally estimated, and he began to grumble behind the scenes. At that time, the people under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime were suffering in deep water and fire, hoping to be liberated as soon as possible. He, however, cursed the pace of the revolution as "too fast, too fast, causing us a lot of difficulties, it would be better to slow down a bit, so we can prepare more leisurely." He was afraid to death of democratic revolution, and naturally, he would be ten times more frantic in opposing socialist revolution.

In the seventeen years since liberation, the top capitalist-roader in the party has stubbornly insisted on his bourgeois reactionary position, fiercely opposing socialism. Soon after praising the reactionary film "The Last Emperor" as "patriotic," in June 1951, he said that "now is the time to prepare for three years and build for ten years," "socialism is a matter for the future, it is too early to talk about it now." In July of the same year, he slandered the poor and lower-middle peasants' preparation to raise the agricultural mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives as a "wrong, dangerous, utopian agricultural socialist thought," attempting to reverse the socialist direction of five hundred million peasants with a single order. Chairman Mao teaches us: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheel of history from moving forward, the revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will inevitably be victorious." In 1956, our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction achieved great victories, the cheers of the revolutionary people made this top capitalist-roader in the party fear to death, hating it to the bone. He again rambled on: "Our steps are a bit fast, we should slow down a bit next year, be more stable." In January 1957, he also said that "the bourgeoisie must be liberated first before the working class can be liberated." "To redeem, to give dividends. Without dividends, the bourgeoisie will rebel, and the proletariat will not be able to liberate itself." The wheel of history rolled on, shattering his "bourgeois republic" dream. However, the top capitalist-roader in the party did not die his heart, and even after the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was completed, he advocated letting capitalists open private factories, saying: "If they (referring to capitalists) want to build factories, should we allow them to build? It's okay." "I don't think it's scary, it's a supplement." During the three years of difficulty, he again fiercely attacked the Three Red Banners, peddling "three selfs and one package," "three harmonies and one less" revisionist goods everywhere, openly shouting "it's not scary if some bourgeois elements emerge in society, don't be afraid of the spread of capitalism."

On the question of where the new China is going, people standing on different class positions have different opinions and different answers. They will also use various means and various channels to create public opinion to realize their opinions. This is not something that can be changed by people's will. The top capitalist-roader in the party never forgets capitalism, he thinks of capitalism, talks about capitalism, and does capitalism, trying to realize a counterrevolutionary restoration in China. This is his consistent position and the fundamental reason for his praise of "The Last Emperor."

The golden monkey rises with a thousand-pound rod, the jade sky is clear of ten thousand dusts. Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the thoroughly anti-communist and anti-people treasonous film "The Last Emperor," thoroughly overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the party who praises this film, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    彻底批判卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    史红兵
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？——评反动影片〈清宫秘史〉》一文的发表，在当前有着极其重大的政治意义。它是展开群众性的批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派斗争的新的起点，是当前无产阶级文化大革命的新的进军号。
    这篇文章高举革命的批判旗帜，剥开了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，揭露了他假反帝、真投降，假革命、真出卖的嘴脸。
    这篇文章高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对由来已久的资产阶级反动路线作了深刻的分析，并向提出和推行这条反动路线的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发动了总攻击。
    这篇文章充满着革命的战斗的激情，表达了全国人民无限热爱毛泽东思想、坚决铲除修正主义、打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫的坚强意志和必胜决心。
    新的战斗号角吹响了，我们必须立即行动起来，以战斗的姿态，以大无畏的英雄气概，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发动最猛烈的进攻，彻底把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
    一、反动影片《清宫秘史》是怎样出笼的？
    《清宫秘史》是香港永华影业公司摄制的。永华的老板即《清宫秘史》的监制人李祖永，在抗日战争时期是一个军火商和买卖黄金的投机商。他曾公开宣称他的公司“决不能让共产党利用”。永华公司的顾问，是抗战时期公开投降日寇的一个大汉奸。这是一家反动透顶的制片公司，它开设的目的，就是为了替国民党反动派的垂死挣扎效劳的。一九四八年出笼的大毒草《国魂》，是它开张以后的第一部影片。这部影片肆意捏造历史，借文天祥宣扬正统观念，鼓吹对蒋家王朝誓死效忠。因此《国魂》受到人民公敌蒋介石的赞赏，下令大量加印拷贝，发往前线各地放映，“以发挥先贤卫国精神，而振士气。”这家公司摄制的第二部影片，便是宣扬卖国主义的《清宫秘史》。编剧是一个名叫姚克的汉奸。影片《清宫秘史》，就是由这样一群牛鬼蛇神炮制出来的大毒草。
    《清宫秘史》摄制于全国解放前夕，美国国务院发表中美关系白皮书的前后。《清宫秘史》和美国白皮书一个腔调，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，肆意地歪曲和捏造历史，充满了对于中国人民的恶毒诬蔑和深刻仇恨。这部影片适应了帝国主义及其走狗进行反革命复辟的需要。它采用借古喻今的手法，把变天的希望，寄托在一群所谓“新派”知识分子身上。影片里的所谓“新派”，就是白皮书里所说的民主个人主义者。影片极力鼓吹通过这些“新派”人物，在帝国主义支持下，帮助失败了的“皇上”，“恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。《清宫秘史》采用各种手法，大肆散布对于帝国主义的幻想，掩盖帝国主义的侵略本质，宣扬屈膝投靠帝国主义的奴才思想。这是为美帝国主义及其走狗服务的一部极其反动的影片。
    一九五○年三月，这部反动透顶的影片在全国放映。这是一场严重的阶级斗争！是建国初期阶级敌人在意识形态领域里第一次疯狂的进攻，是对年青的无产阶级专政进行的第一次最严重的挑战。
    毛主席严正指出：《清宫秘史》是一部卖国主义的影片，应该进行批判。
    当时，担任文化部电影事业指导委员会委员的江青同志，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，几次提出要坚决批判《清宫秘史》，并与吹捧这部影片、阻挠这场批判的反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬和当时的中央宣传部常务副部长胡××进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    一些观众看了这部影片以后，也对它进行了抵制和批判，指出这部电影“模糊与毒害了观众的阶级意识”，“完全歪曲了中国的历史”。
    对这部反动影片的批判，刺痛了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其忠实追随者，他们马上跳了出来，竭力进行阻挠。他们捧毒草为香花，竟把这部宣扬卖国主义的影片，吹捧成“爱国主义”的。基调一定，应声虫们便起劲地颂扬。他们胡说以光绪为代表的一派，“反映了当时新兴的、萌芽的资产阶级的思想，在一定的限度内接受了资本主义的所谓‘文明’，想迎头赶上，以图自强”，还说光绪“是一个有爱国思想的皇帝”。于是报纸上大做广告，以极其肉麻的语言，大肆宣传“本片之伟大”、“其剧之惊人”，并号召“未观者欲观从速！已观者更需再看一次，因为是千载难逢之绝作，未观者切莫失此良机！”一阵阵叫卖声，一阵阵吹捧声，卖国主义影片戴上了爱国主义的桂冠。对这部影片的批判，就这样被扼杀在摇篮中了。
    扼杀这次批判的“大人物”，就是力图扼杀当前这场无产阶级文化大革命的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。就是他，与党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派相勾结，提出和推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，疯狂地压制革命的群众运动，千方百计包庇走资本主义道路的当权派。这个代表资产阶级利益的“大人物”，成了一切牛鬼蛇神的保护伞。在建国以来的历次大斗争中，他都充当了这样可耻的角色。
    二、彻头彻尾的卖国主义
    反动影片《清宫秘史》分明是一部彻头彻尾的卖国主义影片，但是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却把它说成是“爱国主义”的，完全颠倒了黑白。
    毛主席教导我们：“爱国主义的具体内容，看在什么样的历史条件之下来决定。有日本侵略者和希特勒的‘爱国主义’，有我们的爱国主义。”毛主席在讲到爱国主义的时候还指出：“我们的口号是为保卫祖国反对侵略而战。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却和毛主席的教导大唱反调，说什么“真正的爱国主义乃是对于数千年来世代相传的自己祖国、自己人民、自己语言文字以及自己民族的优秀传统之热爱”。简直是一派胡言！完全抽去了保卫祖国、反对侵略的革命内容，完全抽去了阶级斗争的内容。就是这个“爱国主义”的发明人，竟然认为在抗日战争时期加入维持会的，不能当作汉奸，因为“有一些人加入维持会是被强迫的，还有一些人加入维持会主要是为了保护自己的身家性命”。有人“向日人报告游击队的行动”，那是“因为日寇的压迫”，“游击队还应当谅解”。够了，够了！他的所谓“真正的爱国主义”，原来就是彻头彻尾的卖国主义！就是这个“爱国主义”的发明人，极力美化和吹捧外国资产阶级。一九六三年十月，他厚颜无耻地颂扬明治维新养成了日本资产阶级的“那末一股干劲，发奋图强的风气”，还说，“德国过去也是受欺侮，以后才有那股干劲，铁血宰相俾士麦提倡的。”他还说：“我们打了一百多年败仗，就认为中国人不行，丧失了对自己的信心，说西方人行，中国的不好。后来我们向西方人学习了，一学就有了进步。”他对西方资本主义国家卑躬屈膝之情，溢于言表。他“爱”的是什么“国”？他爱的是地主资产阶级之国，他梦寐以求的是在中国实现反革命复辟。这就难怪他要把一部卖国主义的影片吹捧为“爱国主义”影片了！
    在当代，对帝国主义采取什么态度，是检验爱国主义和卖国主义的试金石。
    毛主席在《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》这篇光辉著作里，深刻地分析了美帝国主义的本质，指出一些人“对美国存着幻想”，号召丢掉幻想，准备斗争。毛主席说：“‘准备斗争’的口号，是对于在中国和帝国主义国家的关系的问题上，特别是在中国和美国的关系的问题上，还抱有某些幻想的人们说的。他们在这个问题上还是被动的，还没有下决心，还没有和美国帝国主义（以及英国帝国主义）作长期斗争的决心，因为他们对美国还有幻想。”《清宫秘史》和毛主席的伟大号召相对抗，明目张胆地散布对帝国主义的幻想。《清宫秘史》的吹捧者，中国的赫鲁晓夫，就是散布对帝国主义幻想的头号人物。一九五六年以后，甚至到了一九六三年他还说：“美国统治集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人，逐渐认识到战争政策未必对美国有利。”这是彻头彻尾的害怕战争、反对革命和投降帝国主义的反革命谬论！
    在《清宫秘史》里，帝国主义不是力图把中国变成它的殖民地的侵略者，而是帮助中国实行变法、支持中国走“富强之路”的“朋友”。把“侵略”说成“友谊”，正是美国白皮书的伎俩。就在放映《清宫秘史》之后几个月，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在一个大学的开学典礼上，竟把帝国主义文化侵略说成是“对提高中国人民的文化水平有很大成绩的”。这是明目张胆地颂扬帝国主义对中国的侵略，是可忍也，孰不可忍也！
    《清宫秘史》还通过“新派”人物之口，极力赞美洋枪洋炮洋学堂。这种赞美，就是要在中国人民的心目中，造成对西方资产阶级文明的迷信。无非是要说，中国人这也不行那也不行，过去不如西方，现在差得更远，跪下来乞讨吧。真是无耻！中国人民是有骨气的，绝不听这一套。我们有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。一切崇洋的滥调，统统见鬼去吧！建国初期，在一部分人中间，存在着严重的崇美、恐美、媚美思想，党和政府为了肃清它的流毒，开展了大规模的思想教育工作。正在这个时候放映的《清宫秘史》，却大唱反调，大肆放毒，大吹外国什么都好，这是在群众中间进行奴化教育，散播崇拜“洋人”的奴才主义思想。《清宫秘史》停止放映了，但党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派并没有停止“崇洋非中”的反动宣传。什么“洋人”很少吃粮食，粮食是用来喂牲口的，人主要是吃肉和牛奶啦，什么帝国主义的托拉斯、美国的教育制度啦，一吹再吹，大捧特捧。他公开宣扬“资本主义国家”“有几百年的经验”，“资本家，开过洋行的，当过买办的，他们有经验”，还骂我们的干部不善于向外国资产阶级学习，真是一副十足的卖国主义奴才相！
    夸大帝国主义力量，鼓吹亡国论，是影片《清宫秘史》的一个十分突出的反动内容。影片大肆宣扬恐帝思想，说什么“要杀洋人，万万使不得”，“众寡不敌，强弱悬殊，恐怕要一败涂地”。那个被捧成“爱国主义”皇帝的光绪，亡国论的调子唱得最高。仗还没打，他就说：“战，咱们八成儿要打败”，“总有一天他们要打到北京城来了！”“将来我们中国一定要被瓜分去了。”“眼见得亡国就在眼前了！”被塑造成爱国英雄形象的珍妃，也是满口的亡国论。她说：“日本国虽小，可是他们现在国富民强，咱们不一定打得过他们呢！”夸大帝国主义的力量，露骨地宣扬亡国论，这是彻头彻尾的卖国主义！党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，也是夸大帝国主义力量的吹鼓手，他在一九六五年还在无耻地宣扬“美国是有强大力量的，是世界上最强大的国家。”这和光绪等人不是一样的口吻吗？这是奴才的语言，帝国主义走狗的腔调！
    卖国主义的宣扬者，必然要对爱国主义者进行恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。义和团是真正的爱国主义者，表现了中国人民顽强地反抗帝国主义侵略的革命造反精神。《清宫秘史》却用卑劣的手法，对义和团进行恶毒的诬蔑。第一个镜头便是“手执火把的义和团，横冲直撞的在民众中间狼奔豕突”。影片把义和团诬蔑成无知愚民，是乌合之众，是乱民，到处杀人放火打劫，总之，是一群“状如疯魔”，十恶不赦的人。特别令人气愤的是神坛那场戏，极尽其丑化之能事，简直把义和团描绘成发了疯的魔鬼。任何一个站在革命方面的人，看了这场戏，都会感到愤慨，感到看不下去。如果你赞扬它，那就是等于你赞扬了帝国主义对于中国人民的诬蔑，赞扬了帝国主义对中国的侵略。如果你把它吹捧成爱国主义，那就说明你爱的原来是帝国主义。
    影片把义和团描写成“杀人放火”、“状如疯魔”的“愚民”，而它的吹捧者不正是站在同一立场上，把散漫、保守、狭隘、落后、私有说成是农民阶级的特性吗？影片中翁同龢说：“老百姓是最听话的，也是最容易满足的”。这句话代表了一切官老爷们的普遍看法，这和影片的吹捧者、做官当老爷的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派把群众看成是阿斗，把自己看成诸葛亮，不是异口同心吗？
    影片所宣扬的一切，也就是它的吹捧者所热爱的一切，他的灵魂深处所掩藏着的一切。影片赞扬资产阶级改良主义，鼓吹向西方学习，散布对帝国主义的幻想，夸大敌人的力量，屈服于帝国主义的压力，极力鼓吹亡国论，恶毒地诬蔑反帝斗争，极端地仇视人民群众，如此等等。这一切反动透顶的东西，就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的所谓“爱国主义”！
    三、吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》的政治目的
    《清宫秘史》适应了美帝国主义侵略中国的需要，鼓吹了帝国主义所实行的扶植走狗反对革命人民的政策。影片疯狂地叫嚣要“皇上挺身而出，收拾残局”，依靠“洋人”打进来，“帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。这里所叫嚣的，不正是美国白皮书所供认的“只有靠美国的武力才可以把共产党打跑”吗？这不正是在叫嚣组织“美国的第五纵队”吗？这不是在宣扬美国出钱出枪、蒋介石出人，替美国打仗，杀中国人的那种侵略战争吗？这个仰仗“洋人”的帮助，力图“重振朝纲”的“皇上”是谁呢？就是银幕上的光绪，现实中的蒋介石。按照影片的描写，这个“皇上”在“义和团到处放火打劫，乱得很”的局势中逃走了。可是老百姓却拥护这个逃难的皇帝，“长江以南的官绅百姓，都很拥戴，还有东西各国的使臣，也都向着皇上。”
    请看影片最后的几个镜头：
    村妇：喏！我们听说皇上逃难出来，所以带了一点吃的献给皇上。
    光：现在弄得兵慌马乱，你们还不恨皇上吗？
    村民：阿弥陀佛，皇上是好皇帝，他是帮我们老百姓的。…………
    村妇：是是，我们都惦着皇上呢！我们想皇上一路逃出来，也许会饿了，所以煮了几个鸡蛋，做了几个饽饽，送来给皇上吃。
    光：（神情感动）难得你们这么忠心……
    影片结尾时，村民一齐跪下，高呼“皇上万岁！”车辆经过村民面前，光绪含笑，吃着村民送的饽饽，向村民点首告别，民众夹道跪送，车辆向着阳光，渐走渐远。
    影片作者姚克如此肉麻地美化一个封建的皇帝，给他罩上一层灿烂的光圈，显然，他是站在国民党反动派的立场上，为即将覆灭的蒋介石集团打气，鼓励他们失败了再干，卷土重来。
    奇怪的是那些披着“共产党员”、“无产阶级革命家”的外衣，满口马克思列宁主义词句的党中央宣传部的部长和某几个副部长，以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却对这样的反动影片十分欣赏。他们无耻吹捧，竭力兜售，究竟是为什么呢？
    这部影片是在一九四八年摄制、一九五○年放映的。一九四八年，中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，解放战争的形势已进入一个新的转折点，人民解放军不但在质量上而且在数量上也占了优势。美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派在中国的反动统治正在迅速崩溃中，一个由工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的无产阶级专政的新中国即将诞生。一九五○年，中国人民的反帝反封建斗争已经取得胜利，新中国犹如一轮红日升在东方，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照全世界，中国的革命进入了社会主义革命的新阶段。
    新中国往何处去？走社会主义的道路还是走资本主义的道路？革命胜利的果实究竟归于谁？无产阶级还是资产阶级？这两个问题尖锐地摆在中国人民面前。资产阶级及其代表人物，妄图把革命胜利的果实夺为己有，把中国拉向资本主义的道路上去，在新中国实现反革命复辟。反动影片《清宫秘史》正是迎合了他们这种政治需要。
    影片围绕着帝后两党的斗争，狂热地宣扬资产阶级的改良主义。它说什么“如果要中国富强，必须要维新变法！”“中国这样改革起来，不到三十年，就可成为世界上最最富强的国家啦！”“非变法不足以救中国”。所谓维新，所谓变法，就是鼓吹向西方学习，鼓吹用改良主义的方法，走资本主义道路。向西方学习吗？毛主席指出：“帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。”走资本主义道路吗？这是卖国的道路，这是埋葬革命胜利果实的道路。《清宫秘史》所鼓吹的，正是这样一条道路；党内一小撮资产阶级代表人物所追求的，也正是这样一条道路。在二十世纪五十年代，在中国人民进入社会主义革命的时代，鼓吹资本主义可以救中国，这是彻头彻尾的反革命宣传。
    毛主席在《论人民民主专政》一文中指出：“西方资产阶级的文明，资产阶级的民主主义，资产阶级共和国的方案，在中国人民的心目中，一齐破了产。”“康有为写了《大同书》，他没有也不可能找到一条到达大同的路。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对抗毛主席的教导，热中于向西方学习，一心要走资本主义道路。他的灵魂深处，就是一个根本行不通的资产阶级共和国。他所想望的，和《清宫秘史》所鼓吹的，正是心心相印，一脉相通。
    历史的车轮总是违背反动派的愿望前进的。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，每当革命的关键时刻，在每一个关键问题上，他总是跳了出来，和历史车轮搏斗，企图阻止历史车轮的前进。在抗日战争胜利以后，他就提出了“和平民主新阶段”，和毛主席提出的针锋相对，寸土必争，敌人在磨刀，我们也要磨刀的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。一九四八年，在接近全国解放的时候，毛主席指出战争进程比原来估计大为缩短，他就背后嘀咕起来。当时，蒋家王朝统治下的人民，正处于水深火热之中，巴不得早一天获得解放。他却诅咒革命的步伐“太快了，太快，对我们的困难很多，不如慢一点，我们可以从容准备。”他连民主革命都怕得要死，面临着社会主义革命自然是要以十倍的疯狂来进行反对了。
    解放十七年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，依然顽固地坚持着他的资产阶级反动立场，死劲地反对社会主义。在把反动影片《清宫秘史》吹捧为“爱国主义”之后不久，即一九五一年六月，他胡说什么“现在是三年准备，十年建设时期”，“社会主义是将来的事情，现在提得过早。”同年七月，他把贫下中农准备将农业互助组提高到农业生产合作社的革命要求，诬蔑为“一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”，企图以一纸批示，扭转五亿农民的社会主义方向。毛主席教导我们：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”一九五六年，我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设取得了伟大胜利，革命人民的欢呼声，使这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，怕得要死，恨之入骨。他又喋喋不休地嚷道：“我们的步子跑快了一点，明年要稍许慢一点，稳当一点。”他在一九五七年一月还胡说什么“要先解放资产阶级，才能解放工人阶级。”“要赎买，给定息。不给定息，资产阶级就要造反了，斗得无产阶级自己也不能解放。”历史车轮滚滚向前，粉碎了他的“资产阶级共和国”的迷梦。但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派贼心不死，甚至在资本主义工商业社会主义改造完成之后，他还鼓吹让资本家开私人工厂，说：“如果他们（指资本家）要盖工厂，是否准他们盖呢？可以的。”“我看也不怕，它是一个补充嘛！”在三年困难时期，他又疯狂地攻击三面红旗，到处叫卖“三自一包”，“三和一少”的修正主义货色，公然叫喊“社会上产生一些资产阶级分子并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥。”
    对新中国向何处去的问题，站在不同阶级立场上的人，有不同的主张，不同的回答。他们也总要运用各种手段，通过各种不同途径，制造舆论，以实现他们的主张。这是不以人们的意志为转移的。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派念念不忘资本主义，他想的是资本主义，说的是资本主义，搞的也还是资本主义，企图在中国实现反革命的复辟，这是他的一贯立场，也是他吹捧《清宫秘史》的根本原因。
    金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把《清宫秘史》这部彻头彻尾反共反人民的卖国主义影片批透批臭，把吹捧这部影片的总头目、党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒，把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
