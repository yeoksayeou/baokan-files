In February, Huairou County established a "three-in-one combination" command post for revolution and production on the front line, which played a significant role in leading the county's spring plowing production. During the establishment of the command post, I stood with the revolutionary masses and did some work, but it was far from enough and did not meet the requirements of the situation. I felt that it is a very important factor for revolutionary cadres to bravely stand out, go among the masses, and actively combine with the revolutionary masses for the formation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

As early as January, a small clique of capitalists within the party and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society stirred up a black wind of economism in the countryside. Some cadres in the countryside threw down their tools. Seeing that the spring plowing season was approaching, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were very anxious and urgently demanded strengthening the leadership of spring plowing work. They told the cadres: "Spring fights for the day, summer fights for the time; if you don't plow in the spring, you won't harvest in the autumn. Spring plowing production is so urgent, but you lock yourselves in and don't manage. If you don't go down to take charge of production, we poor and lower-middle peasants will rebel against you!"

At this critical moment, what should I do? Chairman Mao said: "The production of the masses, the interests of the masses, the experience of the masses, and the sentiments of the masses are all things that leading cadres should pay attention to at all times." Chairman Mao also said: "Our responsibility is to the people." Spring plowing production is the most crucial link in the year's agricultural production. If this link is not well managed, it will cause irreparable losses to the people. A strong sense of revolutionary responsibility drove me to step forward. I proposed to the revolutionary mass organizations to convene meetings with the heads of various departments and communes under the county to study the leadership of spring plowing production. This proposal was supported by the revolutionary mass organizations. At these two meetings, the main issue was how to combine the movement with production. After the meetings, I went to some departments under the county to understand the situation, encouraged the revolutionary factions to take on the responsibility of supporting spring plowing production, and helped them arrange their business work.

After the Spring Festival, all spring plowing work was fully deployed, and leadership needed to be strengthened. After consulting with various revolutionary mass organizations and with the strong support of the local garrison and the county military department, I, in the name of the county committee and the county people's committee, convened a county-wide "grasp revolution, promote production" mobilization meeting. This meeting greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres and masses to do a good job in spring plowing production.

After this period of work, the relationship between the revolutionary mass organizations, the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary leading cadres became closer. On the basis of full consultation, a "three-in-one combination" command post for revolution and production on the front line was established. After the establishment of the command post, it immediately focused on the organizational and propaganda work of spring plowing production. First, a large number of cadres were dispatched to various communes to help convene meetings of three-level cadres, production team member meetings, and militia mobilization meetings, establish commune and team revolutionary "three-in-one combination" production leadership teams, and make good spring plowing production plans. Later, a propaganda team was dispatched to widely publicize Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the Party Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes. In this way, all positive factors were mobilized, and the whole county was vigorously engaged in spring plowing production, presenting a lively scene.

In response to Chairman Mao's call, I went among the masses, grasped revolution, and promoted production, gradually combining with the broad revolutionary masses. This gradual combination process was also a process of gradually raising my ideological awareness and breaking private interests for the public good.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although I have been firmly guarding my post, there has also been a "fear" in my mind. I was afraid of making mistakes at work, afraid that the masses would not trust me, and afraid that if I said the wrong thing, the masses would catch me. Therefore, I was cautious in my work and spoke carefully. As soon as the masses posted big-character posters on me, I felt pressured. At this time, I read Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and "Against Libertinism" repeatedly, and the more I read, the more I felt that my thoughts were wrong. Chairman Mao wants us to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," to be extremely responsible for work, and to regard revolutionary interests as our first life. But I was afraid of this and that, hesitant. In short, it was the "self" that was at work. Once private thoughts increased, naturally, I could not stand out, and there would be a distance from the revolutionary masses. Studying Chairman Mao's works made my mind broad, added courage, and I decided to stand out and grasp revolution and promote production with the revolutionary masses.

For a period, I had some doubts about some revolutionary mass organizations. On the one hand, I was afraid they would not distinguish between enemies and friends and hold on to me; on the other hand, I was afraid they were not revolutionary organizations, and I would stand on the wrong side and make a big mistake. Therefore, I did not dare to contact the revolutionary mass organizations much. Some comrades encouraged me to stand out, but I said I would wait and see. At this time, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything." "You should put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for me, and I decided to go among the masses.

Since January, I have had multiple contacts with revolutionary mass organizations, and my thoughts have changed. The facts show that they welcome revolutionary leading cadres to stand out. As long as you have a clear attitude, sincerely support their revolutionary actions, and wholeheartedly work for the good of the work, you will get their support. For example, I actively went to some departments under the county to hold symposiums with revolutionary mass organizations, and they sincerely reflected the situation to me. I also frankly expressed my opinions. They took my opinions seriously, which moved me deeply. Through deep contact with the masses, I also gradually understood the situation of various mass organizations. I deeply felt that the more you are afraid of mass organizations and do not approach mass organizations, the less you understand mass organizations, and the masses do not understand you, resulting in an increasingly distant relationship with the masses; as long as you dare to go among the masses and actively contact them, achieve mutual understanding, you can quickly combine with revolutionary mass organizations.

In the past, I was used to the old way of working, standing high above, issuing orders, and not good at listening to the opinions of the masses, not good at respecting the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses. In the process of contacting revolutionary masses, I deeply felt that this way of working is fundamentally against Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "From the masses, concentrate, and then go to the masses to insist on it, forming correct leadership opinions, this is the basic leadership method." If you want to use the old way to deal with revolutionary mass organizations, it is fundamentally not feasible. Now, I have gradually gotten used to working under the supervision of revolutionary masses, consulting with the masses on everything, and solving problems through equal consultation. I did this, which brought me closer to the revolutionary masses, and many opinions that I could not hear before were heard, and many good suggestions came from the masses. For example, the suggestion to hold a "grasp revolution, promote production" mobilization meeting was initially put forward by the revolutionary mass organizations. The embryonic form of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" production leadership team was first created by some communes. Chairman Mao taught us: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." I increasingly felt that going among the revolutionary masses, first of all, you must put down your airs, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, and be their little students.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. I am determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly break down the "self," thoroughly establish the "public," strive to overcome various shortcomings and mistakes, and always stand with the revolutionary masses. In grasping revolution and promoting production, I will make my own contribution.

At present, our county, like all other places in the country, has a great situation. The command post for revolution and production on the front line is vigorously highlighting politics and launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county, promoting the victory of revolution and production. At the same time, it is further consolidating and improving the production leadership teams at all levels, mobilizing the masses to fully implement this year's production plan, and vigorously grasping production increase measures. We have the confidence and determination to achieve victory in spring plowing production and strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

    和革命群众站在一起
    北京市怀柔县副县长、抓革命促生产第一线指挥部副主任　范振华
    二月份，怀柔县建立了“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，对领导全县的春耕生产起了很大的作用。在建立指挥部的过程中，我和革命群众站在一起，做了一些工作，但做得很不够，远远不能适应形势的要求。我体会到，革命的领导干部勇敢地站出来，到群众中去，主动地和革命群众结合，对于革命的“三结合”的形成，是一个很重要的因素。
    早在一月份，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在农村刮起了经济主义黑风。农村中的一些干部撂了挑子。眼看春耕季节就要到来，广大贫下中农很着急，迫切要求加强对春耕工作的领导。他们对干部说：“春争日，夏争时；春不种，秋不收。春耕生产这么紧，你们却关起门来不管。你们再不下去抓生产，我们贫下中农就要造你们的反！”
    在这关键时刻，我该怎么办呢？毛主席说：“群众生产，群众利益，群众经验，群众情绪，这些都是领导干部们应时刻注意的。”毛主席还说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”春耕生产是全年农业生产中最关紧要的环节，不抓好这个环节，就会给人民造成不可弥补的损失。强烈的革命责任感驱使我挺身而出。我向革命群众组织提出建议，分别召集县直各部门和各公社负责人开会，研究领导春耕生产的问题。这个建议得到了革命群众组织的支持。在这两个会议上，着重解决了运动和生产如何结合的问题。会后，我又到县直一些部门了解情况，鼓励革命派把支援春耕生产的担子挑起来，并帮助他们安排好业务工作。
    春节一过，各项春耕工作全面铺开，急需加强领导。我和各个革命群众组织商量后，在当地驻军和县武装部的大力支持下，以县委、县人委的名义，召开了全县“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会。这个大会，极大地调动了干部和群众搞好春耕生产的积极性。
    经过这一段工作，革命群众组织、人民解放军当地驻军和革命领导干部之间的关系，密切起来了。在充分协商的基础上，建立了“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。指挥部成立后，立即抓紧春耕生产的组织、宣传工作。首先派出一大批干部，分赴各公社帮助开好三级干部会议、生产队社员大会和民兵誓师大会，建立社、队革命“三结合”的生产领导班子，作好春耕生产计划。以后，又派出了一批宣传队，广泛宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传党中央给农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信。这样，就调动了一切积极因素，全县上下大抓春耕生产，呈现出一片热气腾腾的景象。
    我响应毛主席的号召，到群众中去，抓革命，促生产，就和广大革命群众逐步地结合起来了。这个逐步结合的过程，对我来说，也是逐步提高思想觉悟，破私立公的过程。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我虽然一直坚守工作岗位，但脑子里也存在着“怕”字。怕工作上出差错，怕群众不信任自己，怕说错了话群众抓小辫子。所以。在工作上缩手缩脚，说起话来小心翼翼。一见群众给自己贴大字报，就感到有压力。这时，我不断地读毛主席的“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》等著作，越读越感到自己的思想不对头。毛主席要我们“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，要对工作极端的负责任，要以革命利益为第一生命。可是，我却怕这怕那，患得患失。说穿了，这是“私”字在作怪。私心杂念一多，自然就站不出来，就和革命群众产生了距离。学习了毛主席著作，使我心胸开阔了，增添了勇气，决心站出来，和革命群众一起抓革命，促生产。
    一个时期内，我对一些革命群众组织，曾有过某种程度的疑惧情绪。一方面怕他们不分敌我，揪住不放；另一方面怕他们不是革命的组织，自己站错了队，要犯大错误。因此，我就不大敢和革命群众组织接触。有的同志曾鼓励我站出来，我还说要等着瞧瞧。这时，我反复学习毛主席的教导：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”毛主席的教导给我指明了方向，我决定到群众中去。
    一月份以来，我和革命群众组织多次接触，思想发生了转变。事实说明，他们对革命的领导干部主动地站出来，是抱着欢迎态度的。只要你态度明朗，真心诚意地支持他们的革命行动，全心全意地为了搞好工作，就会得到他们的支持。譬如，我主动到县直一些部门同革命群众组织开座谈会，他们都很诚恳地向我反映情况，我也坦率地谈出我的意见。他们对我的意见很重视，使我很感动。经过深入群众，我也逐步了解各个群众组织的情况。我深深感到，越是害怕群众组织，不接近群众组织，越不能了解群众组织，群众也不能了解你，结果和群众的距离越来越远；只要你敢于到群众中去，主动地和他们接触，取得互相了解，就能较快地同革命群众组织结合起来。
    过去，我习惯于老一套的工作方法，高高在上，发号施令，不善于倾听群众的意见，不善于尊重群众的革命首创精神。在和革命群众接触的过程中，我深切体会到，这一套工作方法是根本违背毛主席教导的。毛主席说：“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”如果想用老一套的方法来和革命群众组织打交道，是根本行不通的。现在，我已逐渐习惯于在革命群众的监督下进行工作，遇事多和群众商量，通过平等协商的方法来解决问题。我这样做了，密切了同革命群众的关系，许多过去听不到的意见听到了，许多好的建议从群众中产生了。象召开“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会的建议，最初就是由革命群众组织提出来的。革命“三结合”的生产领导班子的雏形，开始是由一些公社创造的。毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我越来越感到，到革命群众中去，首先要放下架子，虚心地向革命群众学习，当他们的小学生。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。我决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，努力克服各种缺点和错误，永远和革命群众站在一起，在抓革命、促生产中，作出自己的贡献。
    目前，我县和全国各地一样，形势大好。抓革命促生产第一线指挥部正在大力突出政治，在全县掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，推动革命和生产胜利前进。同时，正在进一步巩固和健全各级生产领导班子，发动群众全面落实今年的生产计划，狠抓增产措施。我们有信心和决心夺取春耕生产的胜利，争取全年农业大丰收。
