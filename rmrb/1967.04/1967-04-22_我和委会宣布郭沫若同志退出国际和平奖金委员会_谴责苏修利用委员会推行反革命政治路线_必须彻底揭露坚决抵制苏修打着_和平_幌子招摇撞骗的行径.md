The "Strengthen International Peace" Lenin International Prize Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in Moscow on April 20 to review the list of 1966 prize winners. The Soviet side notified the vice-chairman of this committee and the chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Comrade Guo Moruo, to attend the meeting. Comrade Guo Moruo authorized the spokesperson of the Chinese Committee to make a statement on this matter.

The spokesperson pointed out that the "Strengthen International Peace" Lenin International Prize Committee was originally named the "Strengthen International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee. Its purpose was to encourage and commend individuals who made outstanding contributions to the anti-imperialist struggle and the maintenance of world peace. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which criticized Stalin, the Soviet revisionist leadership changed the name of this organization and turned it into a tool for promoting the revisionist line.

For many years, Soviet revisionists in the world peace movement have vigorously advocated nuclear terror, advocated complete and thorough disarmament, spread the illusion of a "world without imperialism, capitalism, or war," and peddled "three falses and three truths." Currently, especially on the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership is acting as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism, promoting "peace talks" conspiracies, encouraging war escalation, and shamelessly betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. They are extremely afraid of and hate our proletarian cultural revolution, spreading all kinds of slander and lies. They are vigorously promoting a line of complete capitulationism, anti-Americanism, anti-China, anti-communism, and anti-people around the world.

The spokesperson said that the Soviet revisionist leadership is using the "Strengthen International Peace" Lenin International Prize Committee to serve its counter-revolutionary political line. To deceive public opinion, although some of the prize winners are people who have worked hard to maintain world peace, many of them are opportunists and traitors. Even the great traitor of the world revolution, Khrushchev, received the Lenin International Peace Prize, which is an insult to the great name of Lenin.

The spokesperson finally pointed out that the activities of the "Strengthen International Peace" Lenin International Prize Committee to recruit and betray are not about "strengthening international peace" but about harming world peace. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." Therefore, Comrade Guo Moruo has solemnly refused to attend the meeting in Moscow and has announced his withdrawal from this organization, severing all relations with it. The treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist clique, using Lenin's name and the banner of "peace" to continue their deception, must be firmly resisted and thoroughly exposed. The Chinese people will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the people of all countries, to safeguard world peace, support national liberation, and promote the cause of world revolution, making their own contributions.

    我和委会宣布郭沫若同志退出国际和平奖金委员会
    谴责苏修利用委员会推行反革命政治路线
    必须彻底揭露坚决抵制苏修打着“和平”幌子招摇撞骗的行径
    新华社二十日讯　“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金委员会定于四月二十日在莫斯科举行会议，审议一九六六年度得奖人名单。苏联方面通知这个委员会的副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主任郭沫若同志出席会议。郭沫若同志授权中国和委会发言人就此事发表谈话。
    发言人指出，“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金委员会，原名为“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会。它的宗旨本来是鼓励和表彰在反对帝国主义、维护世界和平事业中有杰出贡献的人士。在苏共“二十大”大反斯大林之后，苏修领导集团篡改了这个组织的名称，并把它变成了推行修正主义路线的工具。
    多年来，苏联修正主义者在世界和平运动中，极力宣扬核恐怖，鼓吹全面彻底裁军，散布“三无世界”的幻想，推销“三假三真”的黑货。目前，特别在越南问题上，苏修领导集团充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶，大搞“和谈”阴谋，鼓励战争“升级”，无耻地出卖越南人民的利益。它对我国无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要死，恨得要命，极尽一切造谣诬蔑之能事。它正在全世界加紧推行一条联美、反华、反共、反人民的彻头彻尾的投降主义路线。
    发言人说，苏修领导集团利用“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金委员会为其反革命政治路线服务。它为了欺骗公众舆论，在得奖者中，虽然也挑选了一些为维护世界和平而努力的人，但是，其中不少人是投机分子和叛徒。甚至连世界革命的大叛徒赫鲁晓夫，也得到了列宁国际和平奖金，这是对伟大列宁的名字的侮辱。
    发言人最后指出，“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金委员会的招降纳叛的活动，不是“加强国际和平”，而是危害世界和平。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”因此，郭沫若同志已严正拒绝出席在莫斯科举行的会议，并且郑重宣布退出这个组织，今后不再与之发生任何关系。苏修叛徒集团盗用列宁的名字，打着“和平”的幌子，继续招摇撞骗的行径，必须坚决抵制，彻底揭露。中国人民将永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同各国人民一道，为保卫世界和平、支持民族解放、促进世界革命事业，作出自己的贡献。
