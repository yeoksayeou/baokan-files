Zhejiang Province's industrial sector's revolutionary masses of workers have rushed to repair a large number of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery and equipment, supporting the people's communes in spring plowing and irrigation. At present, the province has repaired more than 20,000 internal combustion engines, pumps, and electric motors on water pumps, and most of the irrigation and drainage equipment in need of repair has been repaired.

This year, Zhejiang needs to repair a large number of agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment, with a large quantity and urgent time requirements. Revolutionary workers in machinery factories across the province have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." They have tightened their schedules to rush the repairs. They also follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people," breaking the old habit of waiting for customers to bring machines for repair. They have formed specialized repair teams, carrying the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and with their tools and bedding, they have climbed mountains and crossed rivers to go door-to-door to repair irrigation and drainage equipment. At the same time, they have worked with the water conservancy departments to train a large number of water pump operators for the people's communes' production teams.

    浙江赶修排灌设备支援春耕
    浙江省工业部门广大革命派工人赶修了大批农业机电排灌设备，支援人民公社春耕灌溉。目前，全省已修理好抽水机船上的内燃机、水泵、电动机等两万多台，大部分需要修理的排灌设备已修理好。
    今年浙江需要修理的农业排灌设备，数量大，时间急。各地机械厂的革命派工人坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，抓紧时间赶修。他们还遵循毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，打破了过去等客送机器上门修理的老习惯，组成专业修理小组，带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，挑着铺盖，背着工具，爬山涉水，主动上门赶修排灌设备。在这同时，他们并和水利部门一起，帮助人民公社生产队培训了大批抽水机手。
