The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution That Shook the World

Ren Lixin

In the midst of the thunderous cannon fire of the revolutionary criticism led by the thought of Chairman Mao, as the revolutionary masses of our country launch a general offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and under the personal care and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born! The proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing have taken power!

The rule of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee has been overthrown!

The dream of restoring capitalism in China, which the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party had based in Beijing, has been shattered!

This is a significant new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our country! This is a new victory for the boundless thought of Mao Zedong!

In 1949, Chairman Mao solemnly proclaimed in Beijing: "The People's Republic of China has been born, and the Chinese people have stood up." The old China, ridden with suffering, has leaped forward to become the new China under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

However, can the power seized by the proletariat after decades of struggle be maintained and consolidated? Will it be seized back by the bourgeoisie? This is a serious question that confronts the entire nation.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, precisely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

Over the past seventeen years, in Beijing, the struggle between the bourgeoisie's attempt to restore capitalism and the proletariat's resistance to this restoration has been particularly fierce and concentrated. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, along with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who support them from behind the scenes, are a group of ambitious plotters, akin to the characters of Khrushchev. They have systematically, planned, and organized their anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities, doing everything they can to turn Beijing into a base for restoring capitalism nationwide. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, with the greatest courage, launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world. This is a general offensive by the proletariat of our country, united with hundreds of millions of people, against the bourgeoisie and their representatives within our Party. It is a decisive battle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, a great cause that determines the direction of China and the fate of the entire human race.

The proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing have waged a long struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the former Beijing Municipal Committee. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a high fighting spirit, and have smashed the "Three Family Village," overthrowing the revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee. The Party Central Committee, with Chairman Mao at its helm, has removed the positions of these revisionists. Although the movement has undergone many twists and turns, the proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing have always firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, waging an unyielding fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their bourgeois reactionary line, and against all big and small counter-revolutionary revisionists. They have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the new Municipal Committee and repelled the repeated onslaughts of the bourgeois reactionary line, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

In the midst of this class struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, breaking down private interests and establishing public interests. Thus, they have withstood various tests, becoming stronger and more resolute in their fighting spirit. They are forging themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. At the same time, they have educated and saved a large number of cadres who have made mistakes. The proletarian revolutionaries have achieved great unity in the struggle, forming a strong army for the proletarian cultural revolution. They have established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, achieving a great victory in the struggle for power.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, born in the struggle for power, along with the revolutionary committees of Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, and other provinces and municipalities, has provided rich experience for the appearance of a new form of proletarian dictatorship in our country. After being tempered by the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary power of the proletariat in our country will be more consolidated and stronger. Such power is power that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, power that has expelled revisionists and restorationists, power that can guarantee our production will develop even more, power that can guarantee our thoughts will become even more revolutionary, power that can guarantee we are better prepared to resist foreign invasions, power that can guarantee we suppress subversive activities, and power that can guarantee we cope with natural disasters and various difficulties. Just as the October Revolution opened a new era in human history, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has opened the path from socialism to communism.

Ninety-six years ago, the proletarians of Paris Commune made the first attempt at proletarian dictatorship. Fifty years ago, the October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin smashed the old state machine with violence and established the first proletarian dictatorship in the world. In 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China was a great victory of the experiences of the Paris Commune and the October Revolution in a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. These three great historical events fully prove the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism: the proletariat must smash the old state machine with violent revolution and replace it with proletarian dictatorship. However, how the proletariat maintains and consolidates proletarian dictatorship after seizing power, prevents the restoration of the bourgeoisie, and carries the socialist revolution to the end, this problem was not solved or could not be solved by all the predecessors of Marxism-Leninism, but was solved by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our great leader Chairman Mao. This is the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world.

This experience tells us that the proletariat, in order to achieve communism, not only needs to seize power from top to bottom with violence and use this power to change all private ownership and establish socialist public ownership, but also needs, under the condition of proletarian dictatorship, to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to use proletarian democracy, to wage a struggle for power from bottom to top. That is to say, to use Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, to thoroughly criticize the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly expel the representatives of the bourgeoisie who are entrenched in the Party and government organs and in various fields, to overthrow them, and to firmly grasp the power in the hands of the steadfast proletarian revolutionaries, to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and to achieve thorough revolutionization of the superstructure in all fields.

This is a long-term, arduous strategic task. If the proletariat, after seizing power, does not strengthen and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, does not carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, does not let Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and allows bourgeois ideas to spread freely, it will inevitably, like the Soviet Union, experience a nationwide restoration of capitalism. The experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the bitter lessons of the international communist movement fully prove that this is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, a great creative development of Marxism-Leninism by the great teacher of the international proletariat, Chairman Mao.

Let the imperialists, modern revisionists, and domestic and foreign reactionaries curse our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Let them tremble before our victory!

Long live the triumphant Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world!

    震撼世界的文化大革命

    在我国亿万革命群众高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的隆隆炮声中，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和指导下，北京市革命委员会诞生了！北京市无产阶级革命派掌权了！
    旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子的统治灭亡了！
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以北京为据点，在中国复辟资本主义的幻梦破灭了！
    这是我国无产阶级文化大革命具有重大意义的新胜利！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    一九四九年，毛主席在北京庄严宣告：“中华人民共和国诞生了，中国人民从此站起来了。”苦难深重的旧中国，一跃而为无产阶级专政的新中国。
    但是，无产阶级经过几十年的搏斗夺得的政权，能不能保持，能不能巩固，会不会被资产阶级重新夺了过去？这是尖锐地摆在全国人民面前的严重问题。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    十七年来，在北京，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，表现得特别激烈、特别集中。旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，和背后支持他们的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是一群野心家、阴谋家，是赫鲁晓夫式的人物。他们有纲领、有计划、有组织地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，千方百计地要把北京变成在全国复辟资本主义的一个基地。一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，以最大的魄力，发动了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。这是我国无产阶级联合亿万群众，向资产阶级及其在我们党内的代表人物，发起的一次总攻击，是两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线斗争的一场大决战，是决定中国向何处去，关系中国命运和整个人类命运的大事。
    北京市无产阶级革命派同旧北京市委推行的反革命修正主义路线进行了长期的斗争。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以高昂的战斗姿态，一举捣毁了“三家村”，打倒了旧北京市委修正主义集团。以毛主席为首的党中央，罢了这些修正主义分子的官，撤了他们的职。运动虽然几经曲折和反复，但是北京市的无产阶级革命派，始终牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所制定的资产阶级反动路线，和一切大大小小的反革命修正主义分子，进行了不屈不挠的斗争；并且彻底粉碎了新市委执行的资产阶级反动路线，击退了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次猖狂的反扑，掀起了革命的大批判新高潮。
    在这场阶级搏斗的大风大浪中，北京市无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，破“私”立“公”，因而经受了种种考验，愈战愈坚强，斗志愈旺盛，正在把自己锻炼成坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人，同时，也教育和挽救了大批犯过错误的干部。无产阶级革命派在斗争中实现了革命的大联合，组成了一支坚强的无产阶级文化革命大军，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的北京市革命委员会，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。
    在夺权斗争中诞生的北京市革命委员会，以及上海、山西、黑龙江、贵州、山东等省市的革命委员会，为我国无产阶级专政的崭新形式的出现，提供了丰富的经验。经过无产阶级文化大革命急风暴雨的洗炼。我国无产阶级的革命政权，将更加巩固，更加强大。这样的政权，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的政权，是清除了修正主义分子、复辟分子的政权，是能保证我们生产更加发展的政权，是能保证我们思想更加革命化的政权，是能够保证我们更便于对抗外来侵略战争的政权，是能够保证我们镇压颠覆活动的政权，是能够保证我们应付天灾和各种困难的政权。如同十月革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元一样，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，开辟了由社会主义通向共产主义的航道。
    九十六年前，巴黎公社的无产者，进行了无产阶级专政的第一次尝试。五十年前，列宁领导的十月社会主义革命，用暴力打碎旧的国家机器，建立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家。一九四九年，中华人民共和国的成立，是巴黎公社和十月革命的经验在一个半封建半殖民地国家实践的伟大胜利。这三个伟大的历史事件，完全证实了马克思列宁主义这样一个根本的原理：无产阶级必须用暴力革命打碎旧的国家机器，代之以无产阶级专政。但是，无产阶级在取得政权以后如何保持和巩固无产阶级专政，防止资产阶级复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底，这个问题是所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者都没有来得及解决或者没有能够解决，而由当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们伟大的领袖毛主席解决了，这也就是震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的经验。
    这个经验告诉我们，无产阶级要实现共产主义，不但需要用暴力自上而下地夺取政权，并用这个政权去改变一切私有制，建立社会主义公有制；同时还需要在无产阶级专政条件下，发动亿万群众进行无产阶级文化大革命，运用无产阶级大民主，进行自下而上的夺权斗争。也就是要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，去彻底批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立毛泽东思想，把盘踞在党政机关和各个领域里的资产阶级代表人物，彻底清除出去，把他们打倒，让政权牢牢地掌握在坚定的无产阶级革命派手里，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，实现上层建筑各个领域的彻底革命化。
    这是一个长期的、艰巨的战略任务。如果无产阶级在夺取了政权后，不去加强和巩固无产阶级专政，不去进行无产阶级文化大革命，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想不去占领一切阵地，让资产阶级思想自由泛滥，就不可避免地要象苏联一样，出现全国性的资本主义复辟。我国无产阶级文化大革命的经验、国际共产主义运动史上的惨痛教训，完全证明了这是一条马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，是国际无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席对马克思列宁主义的又一伟大的创造性的发展。
    让帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派咒骂我们的无产阶级文化大革命吧！让他们在我们的胜利面前发抖吧！
    震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
