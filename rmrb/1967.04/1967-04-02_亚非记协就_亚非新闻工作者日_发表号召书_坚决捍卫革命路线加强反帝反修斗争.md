The Asian-African Journalists' Association Secretariat recently issued a call for "Asian-African Journalists' Day" on April 24, urging all Asian and African journalists to engage in various activities, hoist the banner of anti-imperialist struggle, resolutely condemn the crimes of the American aggressors and the Soviet revisionist clique, and fight for the liberation of the Asian and African peoples.

The call states that while the American imperialists are invading the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they have found willing accomplices in the Soviet revisionist leaders. Over the past year, the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have witnessed the Soviet revisionists colluding with American imperialists, supporting imperialist puppet regimes, intensifying propaganda on "peaceful coexistence," repeatedly attempting to realize "peace talks" between American aggressors and the heroic Vietnamese people defending their homeland and self-determination rights, and intensifying activities to sabotage people's revolutionary movements, split Asian-African organizations, and manipulate various sham conferences, thereby continuing to betray the people's struggle for liberation and genuine independence.

The call states that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, have, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, shattered all hopes of the imperialists and Soviet revisionists to restore capitalism in China. This has greatly strengthened the ranks of the anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples of the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The call states that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association urges Asian and African journalists to strengthen the following activities: fully support the resolute struggle of the Vietnamese people, demand the complete implementation of the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam; condemn the "peace talks" fraud jointly perpetrated by the American aggressors and the Soviet revisionist clique in Vietnam; support the armed struggles of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Arab world; defend the revolutionary line of the Asian-African people's unity movement, raise vigilance against all attempts by the Soviet revisionist leaders to split and betray, and wage a resolute struggle against them.

    亚非记协就“亚非新闻工作者日”发表号召书
    坚决捍卫革命路线加强反帝反修斗争
    据新华社一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处最近就四月二十四日“亚非新闻工作者日”发表号召书，号召所有亚非新闻工作者，通过各种活动，高举反帝斗争的旗帜，坚决谴责美国侵略者和苏修集团的罪恶勾当，为亚非人民的解放事业而斗争。
    号召书说，美帝国主义者在侵略亚、非、拉人民的同时，找到了甘心情愿的帮凶——苏联修正主义领导人。在过去一年里，全世界特别是亚、非、拉人民的革命人民，目睹了苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义者勾结一起，支持帝国主义的傀儡政权，加紧关于“和平共处”的荒谬宣传，再三企图实现美帝国主义侵略者与英勇保卫自己祖国和自决权利的越南人民之间的“和平谈判”，加紧破坏人民革命运动的活动，分裂亚非组织，操纵种种冒牌会议等等，从而继续出卖人民为争取解放和真正独立而斗争的事业。
    号召书说，用光辉的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，通过无产阶级文化大革命，已经粉碎了帝国主义、苏联修正主义妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟的一切希望，这样，便大大加强了全世界特别是亚、非、拉反帝的革命的人民队伍。
    号召书说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处要求亚非新闻工作者加强以下一些活动：完全支持越南人民的坚决斗争，要求彻底实现越南民主共和国四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明；谴责美国侵略者和苏修集团共同在越南推行的“和谈”骗局；支持非洲、亚洲和阿拉伯人民进行的武装斗争；捍卫亚非人民团结运动的革命路线，唤起对苏联修正主义领导人的一切分裂和背叛企图的警惕，并同他们进行坚决的斗争。
