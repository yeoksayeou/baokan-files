The Summit of American States Exposes the Aggressive Ambitions and Isolation of U.S. Imperialism
Johnson's "Economic Integration" Plot Rejected by Latin American Peoples

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, news from Estancia del Este: The summit of American states, orchestrated by U.S. President Johnson, concluded on the 14th in Estancia del Este, Uruguay. The purpose of this three-day meeting, planned by U.S. imperialism, was to use "economic aid" as bait to revive the bankrupt "Alliance for Progress," attempting to further control Latin America politically, militarily, and economically under the guise of "economic integration."

	The United States, in its efforts to enslave Latin American countries, has implemented harsh loan conditions, a policy of buying low and selling high, and tariff restrictions on Latin American products, which have caused widespread dissatisfaction among Latin American nations. Since the beginning of last year, several Pan-American conferences have seen Latin American countries repeatedly raise issues such as easing U.S. "aid" loan conditions and eliminating trade restrictions, engaging in heated debates with the United States. The United States' hegemonic position within the Pan-American Organization has been increasingly weakened.

	At the Estancia del Este summit, U.S. President Johnson personally intervened, on one hand, attempting to appease and deceive Latin American countries with a series of empty promises; on the other hand, he remained unyielding on issues of loans, tariffs, and market prices, and imposed new colonialist shackles on these countries. Johnson vigorously advocated for the establishment of a Latin American "common market" and the "opening of Latin America's internal borders" to further facilitate American plunder and subversion in Latin American countries. According to reports, Secretary of State Rusk had already clearly stated at the ministerial-level preparatory meeting that the United States was not prepared to cancel the additional condition that loans must be used to purchase goods in the United States.

	Under U.S. control, the so-called "Declaration of the Presidents of the American States" adopted at the conference extensively promoted "Latin American economic integration" and announced the establishment of a Latin American "common market" by 1970, to be completed within fifteen years. This is another plot and deception orchestrated by Johnson. This plan, which includes American bosses, can only provide greater convenience for American economic aggression and military suppression, further subjecting Latin American countries to U.S. imperialist enslavement and oppression.

	While Johnson discussed economic issues on the surface, he secretly discussed "communist guerrilla subversive activities" with some country leaders outside the meeting, attempting to drive these countries to contribute to the formation of a Pan-American military organization to intensify the suppression of people's revolutionary movements. The head of the Argentine military dictatorship, Onganía, following U.S. instructions, once again raised the issue of adopting so-called "continental security measures" to deal with "subversive activities" at the meeting. However, this plot by U.S. imperialism once again failed, as Onganía's plan received no support at the meeting.

	According to Western news agencies, this meeting, which Johnson called "extremely valuable," left some Latin American leaders disappointed. Ecuadorian President Arosemena declared his refusal to sign the declaration because it "did not meet the needs of a developing country like Ecuador."

	The broad masses of Latin America have long seen through the purpose of this summit orchestrated by U.S. imperialism. They understand that the nature of U.S. imperialism cannot be changed, and that "imperialists will never lay down their butcher's knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their demise." Before the meeting began, the masses in some Latin American countries had already started protest activities. Workers, students, and other laborers in the capital of Uruguay held strikes, boycotts, and demonstrations during the Estancia del Este summit to protest the arrival of U.S. President Johnson and the summit he orchestrated. Protesters publicly burned an American flag, shouting, "Johnson, go back!" "Drive out the murderer Johnson who is harming the Vietnamese people!"

	Under the strong protests of the people, Johnson was terrified and extremely embarrassed. When he arrived in Montevideo, fearing a beating, he did not dare to take a car but instead took a helicopter to the Estancia del Este venue. During Johnson's attendance at the meeting, the United States sent more than a thousand plainclothes agents as "bodyguards," and U.S. warships sailed to the coast near Estancia del Este, "in case of emergency." This fully exposed the true nature of U.S. imperialists as paper tigers.

    美洲国家首脑会议暴露美帝的侵略野心和孤立处境
    约翰逊“经济一体化”阴谋遭拉美人民抵制
    据新华社十六日讯  埃斯特角消息：美国总统约翰逊一手导演的美洲国家首脑会议十四日在乌拉圭的埃斯特角收场。美帝国主义策划这次为时三天的会议的目的是以“经济援助”为诱饵，给破了产的“争取进步联盟”注射强心剂，妄图在“经济一体化”的幌子下，进一步从政治上、军事上、经济上控制拉丁美洲。
    美国为了奴役拉丁美洲国家而实行的苛刻的贷款条件、贱买贵卖的政策和对拉丁美洲产品的关税限制，引起了拉丁美洲各国的普遍不满。从去年年初以来的几次泛美会议上，拉丁美洲各国都一再提出放宽美“援”贷款条件和消除贸易限制等经济问题，同美国进行激烈的争吵。美国在泛美组织内的霸主地位越来越削弱。
    在埃斯特角会议上，美国总统约翰逊亲身出马，一面对拉丁美洲国家进行安抚和欺骗，作了一大堆空洞的许诺；一面在贷款、关税、市场价格等问题上寸步不让，并且给这些国家加上了新的殖民主义枷锁。约翰逊在会上竭力鼓吹建立拉丁美洲“共同市场”，“打开拉丁美洲的内部边界”，以便为美国对拉丁美洲各国的掠夺和颠覆进一步洞开大门。据报道，国务卿腊斯克在外长级预备会议上就已经明白表示，美国不准备取消贷款必须用于在美国购买货物的附加条件。
    在美国的控制下，会议通过的所谓“美洲国家总统宣言”，大肆鼓吹“拉丁美洲经济一体化”，并宣布将从一九七○年起十五年内建成拉丁美洲“共同市场”。这是约翰逊制造的又一个阴谋和骗局。这个有美国老板参加的计划，只能给美国的经济侵略和军事镇压提供更大的方便，使拉美各国进一步遭受美帝的奴役和蹂躏。
    约翰逊在桌面上谈的是经济问题，而在会外却同一些国家的首脑密谈“共产党游击队颠覆活动”，妄图驱使这些国家为拼凑泛美军事组织出力，以加紧镇压人民革命运动。阿根廷军事独裁政权的头头翁加尼亚秉承美国的旨意，在会上再一次提出了采取所谓“大陆安全措施”来对付“颠覆活动”的问题。但是，美帝国主义的这个阴谋再次遭到失败，翁加尼亚的计划在会上没有人支持。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次被约翰逊称为“极端有价值的会议”，使一些拉丁美洲国家首脑感到失望。厄瓜多尔总统阿罗塞门纳声明拒绝在宣言上签字，因为它“没有满足象厄瓜多尔这样处于发展阶段的国家的需要”。
    拉丁美洲广大人民早就看穿了美帝国主义策划的这次会议的目的。他们懂得：美帝国主义的本性是不能改变的，“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”在会议开幕前，拉丁美洲一些国家的群众就开始了抗议活动。乌拉圭首都的工人、学生和其他劳动人民，在埃斯特角会议期间曾经举行罢工、罢课、示威等活动，抗议美国总统约翰逊的到达，以及他所策划的这次会议。示威者当众焚烧了一面美国星条旗。他们高呼：“约翰逊滚回去！”“把谋害越南人民的杀人犯约翰逊赶出去！”
    在人民群众强烈抗议下，约翰逊胆战心惊，十分狼狈。他到达蒙得维的亚的时候，由于害怕挨揍，不敢坐汽车，而乘坐直升飞机前往埃斯特角会场。在约翰逊出席会议期间，美国派了一千多便衣特务“保镖”，美国军舰开到埃斯特角海岸附近，“以备万一”。这充分暴露了美帝国主义者纸老虎的本质。
