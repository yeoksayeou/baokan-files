In the storm of the "January Revolution," our Red Rebel Corps of the Commercial Bureau and the revolutionary organizations of the provincial commercial system jointly seized all the power of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At this time, the question of how to deal with cadres was prominently placed before us.

First Battle: Should all cadres with the word "chief" be made to "step aside"?

We, the Red Rebel Corps, acted according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy and engaged in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue. We firmly opposed "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" and firmly implemented "uniting the majority and striking a small clique."

The Commercial Bureau has many Party members and cadres. After seizing power, the leaders of the "Red Guards Rebel Corps" and the "Red Soldiers Rebel Corps" insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, negating everything, excluding everything, and striking everything in the cadre issue. They advocated that "anyone with the word 'chief' should step aside." They treated the more than sixty section chiefs in the bureau as "targets for strikes." They propagated that there are still "upper-class masses" among the people and put forward erroneous slogans such as "pulling from above and sweeping from below," directing the spearhead of struggle at ordinary cadres and revolutionary masses. In a meeting they held, they did not touch the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but struggled against dozens of ordinary cadres and revolutionary masses. This "left" in form but right in essence approach severely suppressed the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses.

Facing this situation, the Red Rebel Corps studied Chairman Mao's instructions and relevant editorials from the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze the situation in the Commercial Bureau. We believed that the views and actions of the leaders of the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers" completely deviated from Mao Zedong Thought and the "Sixteen Points," and the overall direction was fundamentally wrong. Regarding cadres, we must use class analysis to distinguish between revolutionary and non-revolutionary. The practice of indiscriminately overthrowing anyone with the word "chief" cannot achieve Chairman Mao's policy of "uniting the majority," and cannot make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution successful.

With our thoughts clarified, we organized revolutionary masses and ordinary cadres to discuss the revolutionary situation in the Commercial Bureau and expounded our views. Our opinions were supported by the broad revolutionary masses, and some cadres who originally felt great pressure began to speak their minds. Then, we publicly announced that we would not participate in the meetings held by the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers," expressing our disagreement with their actions. In this way, the oppressive and dull atmosphere was broken, and many section-level cadres stood up and joined the battle. Big-character posters suddenly filled the four floors again.

The victory of the first round made us deeply realize that only by truly acting according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the "Sixteen Points" can we win over and unite the majority.

Second Battle: Should we strive to unite the leading cadres?

The second step was what to do with the leading cadres of the bureau?

We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and conducted a thorough class analysis of the leading cadres at the bureau and section levels. We believed that among the more than twenty leading cadres in the Commercial Bureau, only a handful were capitalist-roaders within the Party, and the vast majority of cadres were revolutionary. Some comrades performed well during the Cultural Revolution and basically stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; some comrades made mistakes of varying degrees, even serious mistakes, but they were not capitalist-roaders. For revolutionary leading cadres, we should firmly support them in standing up to revolutionize and work with us. For those who made mistakes, we should seriously implement Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," giving them the opportunity to recognize and correct their mistakes, encouraging them to put down their burdens and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

How to help these leading cadres stand up quickly? We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions to various levels of leading cadres: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Some leading cadres, especially those who made mistakes, did not fully understand and seriously implement this extremely important instruction from Chairman Mao. They long placed themselves in a passive position of being criticized, in a position of opposition to the masses. Some wanted to stand up and go among the masses but lacked courage, full of concerns: to get close to the masses, fearing that the masses would not believe them; to do some work, fearing that others would say they were "seizing power." In the struggle between the Red Rebel Corps and the conservative organizations, some, although inclined to the side of the Red Rebel Corps, did not dare to openly express their attitude, fearing that others would say they were inciting the masses to fight the masses. These cadres long separated from the masses and the movement, their thoughts lagged far behind. The more than half-year Cultural Revolution movement did not truly touch their souls. This hindered them from recognizing and correcting their mistakes and also hindered them from standing up to revolutionize. We, the Red Rebel Corps, analyzed these situations and believed it was our responsibility to urge these comrades to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and go among the revolutionary masses. Therefore, we deliberately arranged a discussion meeting, inviting revolutionary masses and some "sidelined" leading cadres to participate.

This unusual meeting caused a great stir throughout the Commercial Bureau.

The participating leading cadres excitedly said: This meeting was well organized and truly touched our souls. Some leading cadres gathered after the meeting and discussed until late into the night, expressing to each other: Chairman Mao calls us to go among the masses, we must bravely stand up and make revolution with the revolutionary masses. Some cadres who made mistakes said: "After participating in this meeting, I truly felt that I made serious mistakes and should consciously revolutionize, also welcoming comrades to boldly expose and criticize."

Most revolutionary masses supported our actions. However, some were worried for us, fearing that the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers" would "catch" our "weakness." Within the Red Rebel Corps, some comrades did not quite understand, doubting whether this was "rightist" or whether we would become "royalists."

The leaders of the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers," who had always been opposed to the Red Rebel Corps on the cadre issue, thought they had finally caught our "weakness." They immediately jumped out, shouting that the "Red Rebel Corps has turned rightist!" and "The Red Rebel Corps has been bought by the power-holders." They attacked this meeting as a "new counterattack by royalists," arrogantly and unyieldingly.

A sharp struggle was placed before us, what should we do?

After careful consideration, we decided to firmly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how many big hats the leaders of the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers" put on us, we must stand tall and firmly resist. We, the Red Rebel Corps, dared to think, dare to do, and dare to revolutionize when struggling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; on the issue of implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and supporting revolutionary leading cadres to stand up to revolutionize, we must also have this fearless revolutionary spirit.

We first organized the members of the Red Rebel Corps to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, unifying the thoughts within the corps. Then, we went among the masses, studying Chairman Mao's works with everyone, widely propagating Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and refuting the slanders and attacks by the leaders of the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers."

Are we "rightist"? Our answer is: truly acting according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy is not rightist. Deviating from Chairman Mao's teachings, overthrowing everything, and negating everything is truly "left" in form but right in essence. The "left" in form but right in essence approach cannot unite and educate the masses, nor can it truly touch the souls of cadres who made mistakes. Only by acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can we help cadres who made mistakes return to the proletarian revolutionary line, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develop more deeply.

Are we "royalists"? We believe: we must firmly struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, showing no mercy. For cadres who made mistakes, we absolutely do not "protect them to pass," and we must mobilize the masses to fully expose and criticize; but once they recognize their mistakes and are willing to stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must welcome them, believe in them, let them work, and absolutely not hold them down. This is not protecting any individual but protecting Chairman Mao's cadre policy and protecting the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

At this time, the editorial "On the Struggle for Power by the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat" from the third issue of Red Flag was published. This editorial conveyed Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions, systematically expounding Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and criticizing the erroneous view of overthrowing all power-holders. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee gave us support and powerful ideological weapons. After studying this editorial, our thoughts became clearer, and our attitudes more resolute.

In this mass debate, the members of the Red Rebel Corps cited numerous facts, criticizing the erroneous views and actions of the leaders of the "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers," explaining that their overall direction was wrong and deviated from Mao Zedong Thought, awakening many deceived masses. As a result, more than 90% of the masses in the bureau stood on the side of the Red Rebel Corps. After the debate, a batch of revolutionary cadres joined the Red Rebel Corps, and our forces further expanded. The "Red Guards" and "Red Soldiers" became more isolated and later had to announce a merger, barely forming a "February 7th Rebel Corps."

Third Battle: Should revolutionary leading cadres participate in leadership work?

The third struggle on the cadre issue was prominently reflected in the issue of Yan Wenqing.

Comrade Yan Wenqing was the original director and Party secretary of the Commercial Bureau. He worked diligently and selflessly. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he made mistakes in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. However, he correctly faced the masses' exposure, criticism, and struggle, without resistance, and continued to work. In the struggle between the Red Rebel Corps and the conservative organizations, he always stood on the side of the Red Rebel Corps. Chairman Mao said: "Not only should we look at a cadre's one-time or one-event, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work, this is the main method of identifying cadres." We believed that although Comrade Yan Wenqing made some mistakes, he was still a revolutionary leading cadre standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For such a cadre, we must firmly support him in standing up and let him participate in leadership work. From late January, we helped Comrade Yan Wenqing check his mistakes. After the Provincial Revolutionary Committee was established, it proposed to absorb Comrade Yan Wenqing into the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ, and we firmly supported this.

The attitude of the "February 7th Corps" was the opposite. They collected materials on Comrade Yan Wenqing everywhere, trying every means to overthrow and destroy him, labeling him as a capitalist-roader within the Party. They strongly resisted Comrade Yan Wenqing's participation in the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and even forced him to admit that the overall direction of the "February 7th Corps" was correct. However, in their siege, Comrade Yan Wenqing always insisted on his correct views and clearly stated that the overall direction of the "February 7th Corps" was wrong. The "February 7th Corps" attempted to save their failure by besieging Comrade Yan Wenqing, but the result was the opposite, making them more isolated among the masses. Soon, the "February 7th Corps" participated in plotting the despicable act of counter-seizing power and finally completely collapsed. Some deceived masses in this organization awakened under the help of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

After the "February 7th Corps" collapsed, we fully carried out work on revolutionary leading cadres and cadres who made mistakes. We organized them to study Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents, arranged for them to participate in meetings of the Red Rebel Corps and revolutionary masses, had individual talks with them, let them discuss the situation and tasks of the Cultural Revolution with the masses, discuss Chairman Mao's cadre policy, discuss active thoughts, and write big-character posters together.

For cadres who made mistakes, our attitude is: we must actively help and strictly demand. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, implementing the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." On the one hand, starting from the desire for unity, we sincerely and patiently helped; on the other hand, we must deeply excavate, touch painfully, and thoroughly criticize their mistakes, not going through the motions, not "performing" for "performing." Only in this way can we truly achieve the purpose of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and be responsible to the Party, to the revolution, and to these comrades themselves. Therefore, we spent a lot of effort helping them recognize and check their mistakes, arranging various forms of meetings for them, letting them "perform" among the masses. Before "performing," we specifically designated some documents and studied and discussed them together, using the two-line struggle as the key, helping them analyze problems and deeply excavate their thoughts. After "performing," we promptly arranged for them to go among the revolutionary masses to listen to criticism, further deeply check. Our actions resulted in some cadres who made mistakes feeling: "Truly touched the soul, felt relieved." Comrade Jia Guishan, the original director of the Party Discipline Inspection Group, said: "I used to not think I had any serious mistakes, but now I truly feel that first, I was wrong, second, I was backward, and third, I should stand up immediately."

Chairman Mao's cadre policy is powerful. We, the Red Rebel Corps, deeply felt from the struggle practice that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and implement the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, we will definitely be able to eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique," gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses through the movement, isolate the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to the greatest extent, and always stand unshakable.

    坚持“团结大多数”，反对“打击一大片”
    黑龙江省商业厅红色造反团
    在“一月革命”的风暴里，我们商业厅红色造反团和省直属商业系统的革命组织一起，联合夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切权力。这时候，如何对待干部的问题，突出地提到了我们面前。
    第一次斗争：该不该让带“长”字的干部都“靠边站”？
    我们红色造反团按照毛主席的干部政策办事，同在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线作了针锋相对的斗争，坚决反对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，坚决实行“团结大多数，打击一小撮”。
    商业厅的党员多，干部多。夺权以后，“红卫造反团”和“红兵造反团”的少数头头，坚持资产阶级反动路线，在干部问题上否定一切，排斥一切，打击一切，主张“带‘长’字的都靠边站”。他们把厅里六十多名科长都当作“打击对象”。他们宣传什么群众里面还有“上层群众”，提出“上揪下扫”等错误口号，把斗争矛头指向一般干部和革命群众。在他们召开的一次大会上，丝毫没有触动党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却斗争了几十个一般干部和革命群众。这种形“左”实右的作法，严重地压抑了广大群众的革命积极性。
    面对这种情况，红色造反团学习了毛主席的指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志的有关社论，以毛泽东思想为武器，分析了商业厅的形势。我们认为：“红卫”团和“红兵”团少数头头的这种观点和作法，完全违背了毛泽东思想，完全违背了“十六条”，大方向根本错了。对于干部，必须用阶级分析的方法，区别是革命的还是不革命的。不分青红皂白，凡带“长”字的一律打倒的做法，不可能实现毛主席提出的“团结大多数”的方针，不可能把无产阶级文化大革命搞好。
    思想明确了，我们就组织革命群众和一般干部座谈，分析商业厅的革命形势，阐明自己的观点。我们的看法得到广大革命群众的支持，一些原来感到压力很大的干部，纷纷讲出了心里话。接着，我们公开宣布不参加“红卫”和“红兵”召开的大会，表示不同意他们的做法。这样，就把压抑沉闷的空气打破了，许多科长级的干部振作起来投入战斗，大字报一下子又贴满了四层楼。
    第一个回合的胜利，使我们深深体会到：只有真正按照毛主席的干部政策办事，按照“十六条”办事，才能争取和团结大多数。
    第二次斗争：要不要对领导干部做争取团结的工作？
    第二步是对厅里的领导干部应当怎么办？
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，对厅、处两级的领导干部，认真地作了阶级分析。我们认为：在商业厅的二十几名领导干部中，党内走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮，绝大多数干部都是要革命的。有些同志在文化大革命中表现比较好，基本上站在毛主席的革命路线一边；有些同志虽然犯了不同程度的错误，甚至犯了比较严重的错误，但还不是走资本主义道路的当权派。对于革命的领导干部，我们应该坚决支持他们站出来革命，和我们一道工作、一起战斗。对于犯了错误的同志，应该认真执行毛主席提出的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，给他们认识错误、改正错误的机会，鼓励他们放下包袱，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    怎样才能帮助这些领导干部很快地站出来呢？我们反复研究了毛主席对各级领导干部说的一段话：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”对于毛主席的这一极其重要的指示，一些领导干部，特别是一些犯了错误的领导干部，没有很好地领会和认真地执行。他们长期把自己摆在一个被动挨整的地位，摆在一个和群众对立的地位。有的人想站出来，到群众中去，又缺乏勇气，顾虑重重：和群众接近吧，怕群众不相信自己；作点工作吧，怕别人说自己“抓权”。在红色造反团同保守派组织的斗争中，有的人虽然倾向于红色造反团一边，但也不敢公开表示态度，怕别人说他挑动群众斗群众。这些干部长期脱离群众，脱离运动，思想落后了一大截，半年多的文化大革命运动并没有真正触动他们的灵魂。这就妨碍了他们认识和改正自己的错误，也妨碍了他们站出来革命。我们红色造反团分析了这些情况，认为有责任督促这些同志贯彻执行毛主席的指示，到革命群众里面去。因此，我们有意识地安排了一次座谈会，请革命群众和“靠边站”的一些领导干部一起参加。
    这次不寻常的会议，在全商业厅引起了很大震动。
    参加会议的领导干部激动地说：这次会开得好，确实触及了我们的灵魂。有些领导干部散会后凑在一起，一直议论到半夜，互相表示：毛主席叫我们到群众中去，我们一定要勇敢地站出来，和革命群众一起闹革命。一些犯了错误的干部说：“参加了这次会议，才真正感到自己是犯了严重错误，应该自觉革命，也要欢迎同志们大胆地进行揭发和批判。”
    多数革命群众支持我们的作法。但是，也有人替我们捏一把汗，担心“红卫”和“红兵”揪我们的“小辫子”。红色造反团内部也有些同志不大理解，怀疑这样做是不是“右”了？“会不会变成保皇派”？
    在干部问题上一直和红色造反团对立的“红卫”和
  “红兵”的少数头头，以为这下子可抓住了我们的“小辫子”了，他们马上跳出来叫喊什么“红色造反团向右转了！”“红色造反团被当权派收买了。”攻击这次会议是“保皇派的新反扑”，气势汹汹，不可一世。
    一场尖锐的斗争摆在面前，怎么办？
    我们经过慎重考虑，决心坚持按照毛主席的指示办事，按照毛泽东思想办事。不管“红卫”和“红兵”的少数头头给我们扣多少大帽子，我们都要挺起腰杆，坚决顶住。我们红色造反团在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的时候，敢想、敢干、敢革命；在执行毛主席的干部政策，支持革命的领导干部站出来革命的问题上，同样要有这种大无畏的革命精神。
    我们首先组织红色造反团的同志认真地学习了毛主席的有关教导，统一了团内的思想。接着，就分头到群众中去，和大家一起学习毛主席著作，广泛宣传毛主席的干部政策，驳斥“红卫”和“红兵”头头对我们的诬蔑和攻击。
    是不是“右”了？我们的回答是：真正按照毛主席的干部政策办事，就不是右。违背毛主席的教导，打倒一切，否定一切，才是真正的形“左”实右。形“左”实右的作法，不可能团结和教育群众，也不可能真正触及犯错误干部的灵魂。只有按照毛主席的指示办事，才能帮助犯错误的干部回到无产阶级革命路线一边来，使无产阶级文化大革命更深入地向前发展。
    是不是“保”？我们认为：对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要坚决斗争，毫不留情。对犯错误的干部，我们绝不“保护过关”，要发动群众充分揭发批判；但是，一旦他们认识了错误，愿意站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，我们就要欢迎他们，相信他们，让他们工作，绝不可以揪住不放。这不是保哪一个人，而是保卫毛主席的干部政策，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    正在这个时候，《红旗》第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》发表了。这篇社论传达了毛主席和党中央的指示，系统地阐述了毛主席的干部政策，批判了凡是当权派就一概打倒的错误观点。毛主席和党中央给我们撑了腰，给了我们强大的思想武器。学习了这篇社论，我们的思想更明确了，态度更坚定了。
    在这场群众性的大辩论中，红色造反团的同志列举大量事实，批判了“红卫”、“红兵”少数头头的错误观点和做法，说明他们的大方向是错误的，是违背毛泽东思想的，使许多受蒙蔽的群众觉醒过来，结果全厅有百分之九十以上的群众站到了红色造反团一边。辩论会以后，一批革命干部参加了红色造反团，我们的队伍进一步壮大了。而“红卫”和“红兵”则更加孤立，后来不得不宣布合并，勉强拼凑了一个“二·七造反团”。
    第三次斗争：支持不支持革命的领导干部参加领导工作？
    在干部问题上的第三次斗争，突出地表现在对待燕文卿同志的问题上。
    燕文卿同志是原商业厅厅长、党组书记。工作一贯勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，他犯过执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。但是，他对于群众的揭发、批判、斗争，能正确对待，没有抵触情绪，照样坚持工作。在红色造反团同保守派组织的斗争中，他一直站在红色造反团一边。毛主席说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”我们认为：燕文卿同志虽然犯了一些错误，但还是一个站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的革命领导干部，对于这样的干部，我们就是要坚决支持他站出来，并且让他参加领导工作。从一月下旬开始，我们就帮助燕文卿同志检查错误。省革命委员会成立后，提出要吸收燕文卿同志参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，我们坚决支持。
      “二·七”团的态度却恰恰相反。他们到处收集燕文卿同志的“材料”，千方百计地要把他斗倒、整垮，打成党内走资本主义道路的当权派。他们极力抵制燕文卿同志参加省革命委员会，还要逼他承认“二·七”团的大方向是正确的。但是，在他们的围攻中，燕文卿同志始终坚持自己的正确意见，明确表示“二·七”团的大方向是错误的。“二·七”团企图用围攻燕文卿同志来挽救自己的失败，结果是适得其反，它在群众中更加孤立了。不久，“二·七”团参加策划反夺权的卑鄙勾当，终于彻底垮台了。这个组织中的一些受蒙蔽的群众，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，纷纷觉悟过来。
    “二·七”团垮台以后，我们就全面开展了对革命领导干部和犯错误干部的工作。组织他们学习毛主席著作和有关文件，安排他们参加红色造反团和革命群众的会议，找他们个别谈心，让他们和群众一起讨论文化大革命的形势和任务，一起讨论毛主席的干部政策，一起谈活思想，一起写大字报。
    对于犯有错误的干部，我们的态度是：既要积极帮助，又要严格要求。我们遵照毛主席的教导，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，一方面，从团结的愿望出发，诚恳、耐心地进行帮助；另方面，对他们的错误，一定要挖得深，触得疼，批得透，决不走过场，决不为“亮相”而“亮相”。只有这样，才能真正达到“惩前毖后、治病救人”的目的，才是对党对革命负责，对这些同志本人负责。因此，我们花了很大力量帮助他们认识和检查错误，给他们安排各种形式的会议，让他们到群众中去“亮相”。“亮相”以前，我们有针对性地指定一些文件，和他们一起学习、讨论，以两条路线斗争为纲，帮助他们分析问题，深挖思想。“亮相”以后，又及时安排他们到革命群众中去听取批评意见，进一步深入检查。我们这样做的结果，使一些犯错误的干部感到：“真正动了脑筋，触了灵魂，心里痛快。”原党委监察组处长贾桂山同志说：“过去一直不认为自己有什么严重错误，现在才真正感到，第一是错了，第二是落后了，第三应该马上站起来。”
    毛主席的干部政策威力无穷。我们红色造反团从斗争的实践中深深体会到：只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地执行毛主席的干部政策，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，相信群众，依靠群众，实行革命干部和革命群众相结合，我们就一定能够肃清“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的流毒，通过运动逐步达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，最大限度地孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，使自己永远立于不败之地。
