Syria Resolutely Strikes Back at Israeli Aggression

	Strikes Down Five Enemy Planes, Kills Over Seventy Enemy Soldiers

	BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) — The Syrian military spokesman announced on April 8 that on the afternoon of April 7, the Syrian Air Force shot down five Israeli planes during an air battle while repelling an Israeli air intrusion. At the same time, Syrian forces destroyed Israeli invaders' ground positions and killed over seventy enemy soldiers.

	The Syrian military spokesman also said that on the morning of April 7, an Israeli tank and two tractors, despite repeated warnings from the Syrian side, forcibly entered the demilitarized zone (this was the third time this week) and were destroyed.

	The spokesman pointed out that the events of April 7 show that Israel is determined to invade Arab countries. Any aggressor will face resolute retaliation and will be annihilated.

	Syrian President Nur al-Din al-Atassi said at a gathering celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party on April 7 that the United States has declared that it will "maintain" the status quo in the Middle East. Imperialists and reactionary Zionists have plotted many counter-revolutionary schemes against Syria. The Syrian people know how to defend their homeland and independence. People's war is the only way.

	He also emphasized: Our struggle is protracted, and we must prepare for this protracted war.

    叙利亚坚决回击以色列侵略
    击落敌机五架打死敌军七十多
    新华社大马士革八日电　叙利亚军事发言人八日宣布，叙利亚空军七日下午在迎击以色列飞机入侵的空战中，击落以色列飞机五架，同时摧毁以色列侵略者的地面阵地，打死敌军七十多人。
    叙利亚军事发言人还说，在七日上午，以色列的一辆坦克和两台拖拉机不顾叙利亚方面的多次警告，强行进入非军事区（这是本周内的第三次）时，被击毁了。
    这位军事发言人指出，七日发生的事件说明，以色列坚决要侵略阿拉伯。任何侵略者都将受到坚决的回击，都将被消灭。
    叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西在七日举行的阿拉伯复兴社会党二十周年的集会上说，美国宣布它要“维护”中东的现状。帝国主义者和犹太复国主义反动分子策划了许多反对叙利亚的反革命计划。叙利亚人民懂得如何保卫自己的家园和独立。人民战争是唯一的途径。
    他还强调说：我们的斗争是持久的，我们要为这场持久战作好准备。
