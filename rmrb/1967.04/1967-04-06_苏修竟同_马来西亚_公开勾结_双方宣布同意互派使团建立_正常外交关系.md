The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in order to collaborate with U.S. imperialism in establishing an anti-China encirclement, has recently openly colluded with the "Malaysia" puppet clique and agreed in principle to establish diplomatic relations.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique recently sent a "trade delegation" to Malaya, where it engaged in activities for half a month starting from March 20. On April 3, the Soviet revisionist "trade delegation" and the "Malaysia" reactionary authorities issued a joint communiqué stating that the two sides had signed a trade agreement, granting each other most-favored-nation treatment in trade and transportation, and establishing trade institutions on an equal basis. The communiqué also mentioned that the two sides discussed the issue of establishing "normal diplomatic relations" and agreed in principle to exchange diplomatic missions.

The British newspaper *The Observer* recently reported that the "Malaysia" puppet Prime Minister Rahman, when expressing his intention to establish relations with the Soviet Union, said that the contacts with the Soviet Union "will have the effect of containing China." According to reports, during the Soviet delegation's activities in Malaya, the delegation leader Spandaryan, in a conversation with journalists in Kuala Lumpur, admitted that his delegation's visit "has important political significance," and that the two sides were not just conducting trade negotiations but also discussing issues of "common interests." Spandaryan also expressed his willingness to follow the example of the United States and send a "Peace Corps" to Malaya.

The people of Malaya maintain a high level of vigilance against the machinations of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and have exposed its treacherous face of betraying the people of various countries. Recently, 22 left-wing trade unions in Singapore issued a statement condemning the criminal activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, stating: "The Soviet revisionists are attempting to extend the black hand of revisionist counter-revolution into Malaya, to sabotage and overthrow the Malayan national democratic liberation movement, and to peddle revisionist goods."

    苏修竟同“马来西亚”公开勾结
    双方宣布同意互派使团建立“正常外交关系”
    新华社四日讯　吉隆坡消息：苏联现代修正主义领导集团为了配合美帝国主义建立反华包围圈，最近同“马来西亚”傀儡集团公然勾结，原则上同意同它建交。
    苏联修正主义领导集团最近派遣了一个“贸易代表团”到马来亚，从三月二十日起在那里进行了半个月的活动。四月三日，苏修“贸易代表团”同“马来西亚”反动当局发表的一项联合公报说，双方已经签订了一项贸易协定，规定在贸易和运输方面相互给予最惠国的待遇，并且在对等的基础上设立贸易机构。公报还说，双方讨论了建立“正常外交关系”问题，原则上同意互派外交使团。
    英国《观察家报》最近报道“马来西亚”傀儡总理拉赫曼打算同苏联建交时就曾经说，吉隆坡方面认为同苏联的联系，“将产生对中国遏制的效果”。据报道，苏联代表团在马来亚活动期间，代表团团长斯潘达里扬在吉隆坡对新闻记者谈话时承认，他的代表团的访问“在政治上有重要意义”，双方进行的不是单纯的贸易谈判，而且是讨论“有关共同利益”的问题。斯潘达里扬还表示愿意仿效美国，派“和平队”到马来亚。
    马来亚人民对于苏联修正主义领导集团的阴谋保持高度的警惕，他们还揭露它出卖各国人民的叛徒嘴脸。新加坡二十二个左翼工会组织最近发表声明谴责苏联修正主义领导集团的罪恶活动时说：“苏修企图将修正主义反革命的黑手伸入到马来亚，进行破坏与颠覆马来亚的民族民主解放运动，贩卖修正主义的货色”。
