	According to a report from the New China News Agency on April 27, London: The United States and Britain have reached an agreement to establish a series of joint military bases in the Indian Ocean. According to the report, a white paper announced on April 25 in London, in the form of an exchange of letters between the British Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Ambassador to London, stated that the two countries have reached an agreement on this matter. These joint military bases will be established on Diego Garcia Island, the Chagos Archipelago, Aldabra Island, Farquhar, and Desroches in the Indian Ocean. According to the agreement, the United States and Britain "can use any facilities built by the other party."

	The sinister purpose of the U.S. imperialists colluding with the British imperialists to establish a series of military bases in the Indian Ocean is to: transport military supplies from these bases to India, threatening China, filling the so-called "dangerous gap" between the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the South China Sea and the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, in order to suppress the liberation struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia to the east and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of East Africa to the west.

    加紧反华军事包围圈　镇压东南亚民族解放运动
    美英将在印度洋建立联合军事基地
    据新华社二十七日讯　伦敦消息：美国和英国已就在印度洋建立一系列联合军事基地达成协议。据报道，二十五日在伦敦以英国外交大臣和美国驻伦敦大使互换信件的形式公布的一项白皮书宣布，两国已就这个问题达成了协议。这些联合军事基地将建立在印度洋的迭戈加西亚岛、查戈斯群岛、阿尔达布拉岛、法夸尔和代罗什。根据这项协议，美国和英国“可以使用对方修建的任何设施”。
    美帝国主义勾结英帝国主义在印度洋建立一系列军事基地的罪恶目的在于：从这些基地向印度运送军事物资威胁中国，填补美国在南中国海的第七舰队和在地中海的第六舰队之间的所谓“危险的空隙”，以便往东镇压东南亚各国人民的解放斗争，往西镇压东非人民的革命斗争。
