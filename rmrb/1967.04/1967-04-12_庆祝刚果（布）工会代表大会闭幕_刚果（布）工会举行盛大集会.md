The Congolese (Brazzaville) Trade Union Federation held a grand rally in the capital, Brazzaville, on April 9 to celebrate the closing of its second congress. President Massamba-Debat attended the rally and congratulated the achievements of the congress.

Paul Bondo, General Secretary of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Trade Union Federation, in his speech, condemned the crimes committed by American imperialists against the Vietnamese people. He emphasized that "the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism is just, and it has made outstanding contributions to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against world imperialism and old and new colonialism."

Paul Bondo reaffirmed the support and solidarity of the Congolese workers and people with the Vietnamese workers and heroic people. When talking about the situation in Africa, Bondo exposed the crimes of American imperialists and their lackeys in Africa, such as plotting subversive activities and assassinating progressive leaders, as well as their ongoing conspiracies. He called on Congolese workers to be vigilant against all the imperialists' conspiracies.

Attending the rally were also members of the Political Bureau of the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement, Montor and Opengui.

The Chinese trade union delegation, invited to attend the second congress of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Trade Union Federation, also participated in this celebratory rally.
