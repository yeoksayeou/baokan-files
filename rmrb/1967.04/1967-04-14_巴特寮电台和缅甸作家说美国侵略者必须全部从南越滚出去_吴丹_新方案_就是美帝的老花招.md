Radio Pathet Lao and Burmese Writer Say U.S. Aggressors Must Completely Withdraw from South Vietnam

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kengkay, April 11th - Radio Pathet Lao broadcasted an article by an observer on the 10th, pointing out that U.N. Secretary-General U Thant's so-called "new peace proposal" on the Vietnam issue is a lifeline thrown to the Johnson administration, which is desperately struggling.

The article said that U Thant's so-called "peace proposal" does not mention a single word about the U.S. imperialist aggression but instead calls for a "complete and on-the-spot ceasefire" by all parties. In other words, it demands that the military and people of North and South Vietnam lay down their arms and surrender to U.S. imperialism and its puppets.

The article pointed out that U Thant's "ceasefire," apart from those who have received rewards from U.S. imperialism or those who harbor foolish illusions about U.S. imperialist deception, will be firmly opposed by anyone with even a shred of national pride and spirit of resistance.

The article emphasized that U Thant's "proposal" completely aligns with the U.S. imperialist position of aggression. For this reason, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys eagerly welcomed U Thant's "proposal" and praised it endlessly.

The article said that the fate of Vietnam is to be decided by the Vietnamese people themselves, and the United Nations or anyone else has no right to interfere. As long as there is a shadow of the invading army on Vietnamese soil, the 31 million Vietnamese people have the right to continue fighting to drive out the invaders.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 12th - Burmese famous writer Du Amah recently published an article in the "People's Daily" pointing out that U.N. Secretary-General U Thant's so-called "new plan" to solve the Vietnam War is serving the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" deception.

She said that U Thant's "new plan" is no different from Johnson's "unconditional negotiations."

She said, the United States is the aggressor, and Vietnam is the victim. The invading troops must completely withdraw. As long as the U.S. invading troops remain in Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will continue to resist. She said, if anyone wants the Vietnamese people to stop their just resistance, that is an insult to the Vietnamese people.

She said, the U.S. aggressors are being beaten black and blue by the Vietnamese people in Vietnam and are at a dead end. It is facing the most miserable fate in Vietnam. It is now in a desperate situation of people's war. Those who attempt to rescue the United States from this desperate situation, whether it is U Thant or the Pope, Indira Gandhi or Kosygin, will only end up in the same desperate situation as Johnson.

    巴特寮电台和缅甸作家说美国侵略者必须全部从南越滚出去
    吴丹“新方案”就是美帝的老花招
    据新华社康开十一日电　巴特寮电台十日广播一篇观察家的文章指出，吴丹关于越南问题的所谓“新的和平建议”是给正在竭力进行绝望挣扎的约翰逊政府抛出的一个救生圈。
    文章说，吴丹的所谓“和平建议”，只字不提美帝国主义的侵略行动，却大肆呼吁各方“全面和就地休战”。换句话说，就是要越南南北两方军民放下武器，向美帝国主义及其走狗投降。
    文章指出，吴丹的“休战”，除了那些得到美帝国主义的赏赐，或者是对美帝国主义的欺诈论调抱有愚蠢幻想的人才肯甘心低头接受以外，即使稍微还有一点民族自豪感和倔强精神的人，都一定会坚决反对的。
    文章强调指出，吴丹的“建议”完全符合美帝国主义的侵略立场。正因为这样，美帝国主义及其仆从迫不及待地表示欢迎吴丹的“建议”，并对它赞不绝口。
    文章说，越南的命运是由越南人民自己来决定的，联合国或者任何人都无权过问。只要越南国土上还有侵略军的影子，三千一百万越南人民就有权继续战斗，把侵略军赶出去。
    据新华社仰光十二日电　缅甸著名作家杜阿玛最近在《人民报》上发表文章指出，联合国秘书长吴丹提出的所谓解决越南战争问题的“新方案”是为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳的。
    她说，吴丹的“新方案”同约翰逊的“无条件谈判”根本没什么区别。
    她说，美国是侵略者，越南是被侵略者。侵略军必须全部滚出去。只要美国侵略军赖在越南，越南人民就要继续抵抗下去。她说，如果有谁要越南人民停止他们的正当抵抗，那就是对越南人民的侮辱。
    她说，美国侵略者在越南被越南人民打得鼻青脸肿，处于死路一条。它在越南正面临着最可悲的命运。它如今已陷于人民战争的绝境之中。那些企图把美国从这一绝境中挽救出来的人，不管是吴丹还是教皇，是英迪拉·甘地还是柯西金，只能同约翰逊一块儿陷入绝境。
