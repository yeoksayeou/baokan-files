The reactionary film "Spark" must be thoroughly criticized

Beijing Film Academy, Teng Feiming

In 1963, the poisonous film "Spark" was screened nationwide. Some people called it an "epic film reflecting the workers' movement in China in the 1920s," praising it as a "model of depicting the Party's leadership." They said it "accurately recreated the scene of the Chinese proletariat's struggle when they first stepped onto the historical stage in the 1920s," successfully shaping a "glorious image of a Communist Party representative." Is that really the case?

No, absolutely not!

The film "Spark" is a big poisonous weed that prepares public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. It is a reactionary film that sings the praises of and builds monuments for China's Khrushchev.

The character Lei Huanjue in the film "Spark" refers to the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. The film details how Lei Huanjue, after arriving at the mine, opened night schools, established clubs, and "propagated" the revolution; how he acted bravely, facing off against capitalists in "heroic" struggles; how he made "wise decisions," leading the Anshan Great Strike, and so on. It completely praises him as the "creator" of the Anshan workers' movement and the "savior" of the people. The film also spends a lot of time describing Lei Huanjue's solo attendance at a meeting to negotiate with capitalists:

"The entrance to the negotiation was filled with sentries, guns gleaming, a murderous atmosphere.
Lei Huanjue walked step by step through the rows of gleaming bayonets..."

What a heroic and unyielding "heroic" demeanor!

Is this number one capitalist-roader in the Party really such a "brave" hero? Is he really the "towering leader" of the Anshan workers' movement?

That's false. That's a distorted history.

The revolutionary workers' movement in Anshan was personally initiated and led by our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Anshan workers.

As early as the winter of 1921, soon after the founding of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao came to Anshan.

Chairman Mao went down into the coal mines with the workers, visited the workers' grass huts, and had heart-to-heart talks with them, inspiring them to fight against the capitalists. Chairman Mao patiently explained to the workers: "We have a big iron plate on our backs. One person can't push it over, but if we unite, we can push it aside!" Simple analogies, profound truths, every word and sentence is etched in the workers' hearts. The workers said: "Since Pangu opened the heavens, we have never seen such a good person." Later, Chairman Mao returned to Hunan and immediately convened a meeting, sending a large number of cadres to open night schools and establish clubs. The workers' movement in Anshan developed rapidly.

"Until 1921, suddenly the fog dispersed and the sky cleared, a capable person, Mao Runchang, came from Hunan to Anshan. He talked with the workers, relieved their sufferings, and proposed to establish a union, uniting the laborers."

This folk song enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao as the great savior of the Anshan workers, eloquently illustrating that the seeds of revolution were sown by Chairman Mao, and the flames of struggle were ignited by Chairman Mao!

In September 1922, under the impact of strike movements across the country, an unstoppable great strike came to Anshan. On the eve of the strike (September 8), Chairman Mao came to Anshan again, participated in the Party branch meeting of the Anshan Mine Workers' Club, comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation at that time, raised the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line, pointed out that the time for the strike was ripe, and made meticulous arrangements for the strike.

On the eve of the strike, the reactionaries sent troops to suppress the movement, and the situation was very critical. At this crucial moment, Chairman Mao sent a letter instructing the workers not to be afraid, that the enemy was strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and that persistence would lead to victory. He vigorously inspired the workers' fighting spirit with his high degree of revolutionary heroism.

Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions laid the foundation for the victory of the great strike. After the strike's victory, Chairman Mao went to Anshan several times, guiding the workers' revolutionary movement towards a new path of combining armed struggle with the peasant movement, and leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising. The history of the revolutionary struggle of the Anshan workers is the history of the glorious victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

However, in this film that claims to be an "epic of the Chinese workers' movement in the 1920s," Chairman Mao is not mentioned at all, and not a single shot is shown. This is so vicious and despicable, intolerable!

The creators and promoters of the film worship this number one capitalist-roader in the Party so fervently. We must see what he actually did in Anshan? What line did he pursue?

He arrived in Anshan on the eve of the great strike (September 12-13, 1922). At this time, the extensive revolutionary work that Chairman Mao had done over nearly a year had already prepared the workers thoroughly in terms of ideology and organization, and on September 8, he personally made a comprehensive arrangement for the entire strike. How could he be considered the initiator and leader of the great strike?

After arriving in Anshan, he was not the "brave" hero described in the film, but a thorough capitalist lackey, pursuing a revisionist line.

According to old workers, this Chinese Khrushchev was very afraid during the strike negotiations and went only because he was protected by tens of thousands of workers.

In an article he wrote a year later, "A Brief History of the Workers' Movement in Anshan Mine," he clearly exposed his filthy soul at that time. At that time, "the strike movement was unstoppable," and "workers in the mine and various places were eager to move." The situation was very good. But this impending storm frightened this strike "leader." He wrote in a state of hesitation and difficulty: "The club is now in a situation where it is riding a tiger." After the strike's victory, he was still frightened and called this strike a "desperate strike." Since it was a "desperate strike," how could he be "brave"? Of course, he was "full of ghosts." Going to the negotiations was just another trick of his "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage."

Facts speak louder than words. No matter how the film beautifies his "heroic" image, it cannot cover up his traitorous face; no matter how the film boasts about his "great victory" in negotiations, it cannot cover up his line of class capitulation.

Due to the parliamentary struggle line of this number one capitalist-roader in the Party, after the strike, the capitalists did not even want to fulfill the negotiation agreement. The workers, unable to bear it any longer, organized themselves to continue the struggle. But this "leader" of the workers, the club director, was so afraid that he did not come to lead the workers' struggle but instead acted as a capitalist's accomplice, using "economic difficulties in the mine" to cover up for the capitalists, slandering the workers' strike as "malingering," "causing various disturbances," and signing the so-called "Agreement between the General Office of Ping Mine and the Anshan Mine Workers' Club" on behalf of the club, which sold out the interests of the working class and suppressed the workers' movement. The fifth clause stated: "The club should make every effort to maintain the mine's production, with the current number of people, to ensure that the average daily output reaches more than 2,300 tons." In the sixth clause, it was even more servile: "The rules for workers established by the mine should be followed by all workers and representatives, regardless of where they are. If there are violations, they should be dealt with according to the rules. In the future, if workers have any matters, they should be handled by the club director in contact with the mine, and they should not gather crowds to make noise and threaten, nor should they go on strike to disrupt work. If there is such a situation, the club should be responsible."

How vividly this depicts the face of a traitor! He not only guaranteed the capitalists' production but also advocated "exploitation is reasonable," and together with the capitalists, he insulted the workers' movement as "gathering crowds to make noise and threaten," spreading the reactionary logic of "resistance is a crime." Where is there a bit of the smell of a Communist Party member? Where is there a trace of a leader of the workers' movement? He is a thorough traitor.

It is precisely this traitor who is beautified in the film as a "Communist warrior" and the "leader" of the working class. What is particularly disgusting is that the revisionist Summer Yan ordered that when his incarnation appears, a halo should be placed above his head. Look! How shamelessly they are praising him! It is precisely this line of groveling to the capitalists and suppressing the workers' movement that is highly praised in the film. This small group of revisionists, Summer Yan and Chen Huangmei, blatantly distorted history, viciously defamed and attacked our great leader Chairman Mao, attempting to make this traitor who sold out the workers' movement, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, become the leader of the Anshan Great Strike in people's minds, steal the fruits of the workers' bloody struggle, and obtain the "leader's" laurel wreath on his head, in order to achieve their shameful goal of restoring capitalism.

The reactionary film "Spark" castrated the revolutionary soul of Mao Zedong Thought, distorted the workers' movement beyond recognition, and openly built monuments for China's number one ambitious man. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it must be thoroughly criticized! The evil influence it has caused must be eliminated, and the history that has been turned upside down must be turned right side up.

    反动影片《燎原》必须彻底批判
    北京电影学院　滕飞明
    一九六三年，毒草影片《燎原》在全国放映后，有些人把它称作“反映二十年代中国工人运动的史诗式的电影”，誉为“表现党的领导的典范”；说它“准确地再现了二十年代中国无产阶级刚刚登上历史舞台时的斗争图景”，成功地塑造了一个“共产党代表的光辉形象”。真是这样吗？
    不是，绝对不是！
    影片《燎原》是一株为资本主义复辟准备舆论的大毒草，是一部为中国的赫鲁晓夫歌功颂德、树碑立传的反动影片。
    影片《燎原》中的雷焕觉，指的就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。影片详细地描写了雷焕觉来到矿上后，怎样开办夜校，创建俱乐部，“宣传”革命；怎样见义勇为，面对面与资本家“英勇”斗争；怎样“英明决策”，领导了安源大罢工，等等。完全把他吹捧成安源工人运动的“缔造者”，人民的“救世主”。影片还特别用大量篇幅描写雷焕觉只身赴会，与资本家谈判的一场戏：
    “谈判的门口布满了岗哨，刀枪林立，一股杀气腾腾的样子。
    雷焕觉在闪闪发光的枪刺行列中，一步一步走上去。……”
    好一副大义凛然，威武不屈的“英雄”气概！
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派真是那样的一个“一身是胆”的英雄吗？真是安源工人运动的“高大无比的领袖”吗？
    那是假的。那是被他们歪曲了的历史。
    安源的革命工人运动是我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。毛主席是安源工人心中最红最红的红太阳。
    早在一九二一年冬，中国共产党刚刚成立不久，毛主席就来到了安源。
    毛主席和工人们一起下煤窿，到工人住的草棚里去访问，和工人们促膝谈心，启发他们和资本家斗争。毛主席循循善诱地告诉工人们：我们身上压着一块大铁板，一个人是推不翻的，要是我们团结起来就能把它推开！通俗的比喻，深刻的道理，一字一句铭刻在工人心里。工人们说：“打从盘古开天地，就没见过这样好的人。”后来毛主席回到湖南立即召开会议，派来大批干部，办夜校、创建俱乐部，安源的工人运动迅猛地发展起来了。
    “直到一九二一年，忽然雾散见晴天，有个能人毛润芝，打从湖南来安源，他和工友把话谈，解除苦难不为难，提议要给办工会，劳动工界结成团。”
    这个歌谣热情质朴地歌颂了毛主席是安源工人的大救星，雄辩地说明了：革命的种子是毛主席播下的，斗争的烈火是毛主席点燃的！
    一九二二年九月，在全国各地罢工运动的冲击下，安源的一场势不可挡的大罢工来临了。毛主席在罢工的前夜（九月八日）又一次来到安源，参加了安源路矿工人俱乐部的党支部会，全面地分析了当时国际国内形势，高举无产阶级革命路线的大旗，指出罢工时机已经成熟，并对罢工进行了周密的部署。
    罢工前夕，反动派调兵镇压，情况十分危急。就在这关键时刻，毛主席又写来一封信，指示工人们不要怕，敌人是外强中干的，坚持就会取得胜利。他以高度的革命英雄主义有力地鼓舞了工人们的斗志。　
    毛主席这一系列英明决策，奠定了大罢工胜利的基础。罢工胜利后，毛主席又几次去安源，将工人革命运动引向与武装斗争和与农民运动相结合的崭新道路，举行了秋收起义。安源革命工人斗争史，就是毛主席革命路线辉煌胜利的历史。
    可是，在这部描写“二十年代中国工人运动的史诗式”的影片中，却对毛主席只字不提，一个镜头也不表现。如此恶毒、卑鄙，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    影片的炮制者和吹鼓手们对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派如此焚香顶礼，我们倒要看看他在安源到底干些什么？推行的是一条什么路线？
    他初到安源是在大罢工的前夜（一九二二年九月十二、三日）。这时，毛主席在将近一年的时间里所作的大量革命工作，已为罢工作好了充分思想和组织准备，并且在九月八日亲自对整个罢工做了全面部署和安排。他又怎么能谈得上是大罢工的发动者和领导者呢？
    他到安源后，根本不是影片描写的什么
    “一身是胆”的英雄，而是个地地道道的资本家的走狗，不折不扣地推行了一条修正主义路线。
    据老工人们讲：这个中国的赫鲁晓夫参加罢工谈判时非常害怕，是成千上万的工人保护着才去的。
    在他一年以后写的《安源路矿工人运动史略》一文中，鲜明地暴露了他此时的肮脏灵魂。当时，“罢工运动，已勃不可遏”，“矿局窿上及各处工人也都跃跃欲动”，形势好得很。但这山雨欲来风满楼之势却吓坏了这位罢工“领袖”。他进退维谷，左右为难地写道：“俱乐部此时已成骑虎之势。”罢工胜利后，他还心有余悸，把这次罢工称之为“铤而走险的大罢工”。既然是“铤而走险”，他哪里还是“一身是胆”？当然“全身是鬼”了。硬着头皮去谈判，只不过是再一次耍弄其“吃小亏占大便宜”的投机手段罢了。
    事实胜于雄辩，无论影片怎样美化其“英雄”状，也掩盖不了他的工贼嘴脸；无论影片怎样吹嘘其谈判斗争的“伟大胜利”，也粉饰不了他阶级投降主义的路线。
    由于这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的议会斗争路线，罢工后，资本家连谈判的协议都不想兑现。工人们忍无可忍，自动组织起来继续斗争。但这个工人“领袖”、俱乐部主任却害怕得要死，不仅不来领导工人斗争，反而充当了资本家的帮凶，用“矿上经济困难”为资本家开脱掩饰，污蔑工人罢工是“怠工”，“演出各种纷乱”，并以俱乐部名义和资本家签订了出卖工人阶级利益，镇压工人运动的所谓《萍矿总局与安源路矿工人俱乐部协定条件》。其中第五条写道：“俱乐部对于矿局生产应竭力维持，照现人数，使每日平均出产额达到两千三百吨以上之数目”。又在第六条中更加奴颜婢膝地写道：“矿局所订工人遵守规则，无论何处工人及代表，皆应共同遵守，如有所犯，照该规则办理。以后工人如有事项应由俱乐部主任专与矿局接洽，不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟，并不得动辄罢工妨碍工作，如有此情形，应由俱乐部负责。”
    多么形象地勾画出一个叛徒的嘴脸，他不仅保障资本家的生产额，早已鼓吹“剥削有理”，而且和资本家一起辱骂工人运动是
  “聚众喧扰要挟”，散布“反抗有罪”的反动逻辑。这哪里有一点共产党员的气味？哪里有个工人运动领导人的样子？完全是个地地道道的工贼。
    就是这么一个工贼，在影片中却被美化为一个“共产主义战士”，工人阶级的“领袖”。尤其肉麻的是，修正主义分子夏衍还下令：在其化身出场时，要给他头上打出一个神仙般的光圈，看！吹捧到了何等无耻的地步！就是这样一条对资本家卑躬屈膝，对工人运动百般压制的修正主义路线，在影片中却被大肆歌颂。夏衍、陈荒煤这一小撮修正主义分子大肆篡改历史，恶毒地贬低、攻击伟大的领袖毛主席，妄图使这个出卖工人运动的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在人们心目中成为安源大罢工的领袖，窃取工人流血斗争的果实，换得他头上“领袖”的桂冠，以达到其复辟资本主义的可耻目的。
    《燎原》这部反动影片阉割了毛泽东思想的革命灵魂，把工人运动歪曲得不成样子，公开为中国头号野心家树碑立传，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中必须彻底批判！它所造成的恶劣影响必须清除，被颠倒了的历史必须颠倒过来。
