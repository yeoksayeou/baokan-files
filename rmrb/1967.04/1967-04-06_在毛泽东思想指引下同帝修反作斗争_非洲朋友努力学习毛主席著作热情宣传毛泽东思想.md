African friends love the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and are striving to study Chairman Mao's works and enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

A young Guinean cadre recently obtained a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," a book he had long desired. He carries this red book with him and studies it whenever he has time. He enthusiastically told a Chinese friend, "Quotations from Chairman Mao is an indispensable guide to action for all oppressed peoples in the world in their struggle against imperialism and all reactionaries and for national liberation."

He said that revolutionary youths in Guinea all love to read this book. He and his friends all agree that Comrade Lin Biao said, "Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions," which truly expresses what revolutionary people want to say.

Another Guinean official named Malik, after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary teacher of our time. He understands the oppressed and exploited people the best. His words are all truth. The more I read his works, the more I love them."

He said that Chairman Mao's statement, "All reactionaries are paper tigers," has given the Guinean people, who are fighting against the most ferocious U.S. imperialism in the world, confidence and courage.

Before the French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" arrived in Guinea, Malik used to copy down the quotations from Chairman Mao that appeared on the cover of Xinhua News Agency's news bulletins every day and study them, and then send them to his friends. He said, "Now that I have a copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I can copy more quotations for my colleagues. I will fully utilize this method to propagate the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong. May the red light of great Mao Zedong Thought shine all over the world."

A professor from Mali recently wrote to a Chinese friend saying that after studying Chairman Mao's works on people's war, he realized that the decisive factor in winning or losing a war is the people, and that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Therefore, his fighting spirit and confidence have been enhanced. He wrote, "From now on, I have decided to be inspired by Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of serving the world revolution."

A student at the administrative cadre school in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, has been studying Chairman Mao's works since 1965. He said, "The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I love them."

A Zambian friend wrote a letter enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao, saying, "We Zambian people believe that the struggle of the African people is inspired by our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao." He said, "Dear Chairman Mao has wisely said, 'The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you.'" In his letter, he pointed out that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are currently trying to control Africa and attempt to shackle the broad masses of Africa with the chains of neo-colonialism. Therefore, "We Zambian youth, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, will struggle in Africa against all paper tigers—the puppets of imperialism and modern revisionists. We are ready to bring great revolutionary enthusiasm into this struggle."

He said in his letter, "We have boundless admiration and love for Chairman Mao. We wish Chairman Mao a long life."

		Guinean workers have been eagerly awaiting a photograph of the great leader Chairman Mao in military uniform. When they received this photograph, they immediately placed it on their workbench and saluted Chairman Mao's portrait. Then they shouted, "Great Chairman Mao, we love you!"

    在毛泽东思想指引下同帝修反作斗争
    非洲朋友努力学习毛主席著作热情宣传毛泽东思想
    新华社讯　非洲朋友热爱世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席，努力学习毛主席著作，热情宣传毛泽东思想。
    一位年轻的几内亚干部不久前得到了一本他渴望已久的法文版《毛主席语录》。他把这本红书随身携带着，抓紧时间学习。他热情地向中国朋友说：“《毛主席语录》是全世界被压迫人民反对帝国主义和一切反动派、争取民族解放斗争的必不可少的行动指南。”
    他说，几内亚革命青年都爱读这本书。他和他的朋友都认为林彪同志说的：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”是说出了真正的革命人民所要说的话。
    还有一位名叫马里克的几内亚职员，在得到一本《毛主席语录》后激动地说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的革命导师。他最了解被压迫和被剥削的人民。他的话句句都是真理。他的著作我越读越爱读。”
    他说，毛主席指出的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”这句话给了正在对全世界最凶恶的美帝国主义进行斗争的几内亚人民以信心和勇气。
    在法文版《毛主席语录》还未到几内亚以前，马里克每天都要把刊载在新华社新闻稿封面上的毛主席语录抄下来学习，并转寄给他的朋友。他说，现在我有了一本《毛主席语录》，我就可以更多地抄写语录给我的同事。我要充分利用这个方法来宣传毛泽东的光辉思想。祝伟大的毛泽东思想的红光普照全球。
    一位马里教授最近写信告诉中国朋友说，他学习了毛主席关于人民战争的著作，认识到决定战争胜负的是人民，并认识到帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，因此提高了斗争的勇气和信心。他写道：“我从此就下定决心，要以毛主席的为世界革命服务的英明思想来鼓舞自己。”
    毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特行政干部学校有一位学员，从一九六五年开始就坚持学习毛主席著作。他说：“毛主席的书我越读越爱读。”
    一位赞比亚朋友写信热情赞扬毛主席说：我们赞比亚人民认为，我们非洲人民的斗争，“是受到我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅和伟大舵手、我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席所鼓舞的”。他说，“敬爱的毛主席十分英明地说过：‘世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。’”他在来信中指出，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义目前都在竭力控制非洲，企图把非洲广大群众套上新殖民主义的枷锁。因此，“我们赞比亚青年，在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，将在非洲同一切纸老虎——帝国主义的傀儡和现代修正主义者作斗争，我们准备带着巨大的革命热情投入这场斗争。”
    他在信中最后说：我们对毛主席无限敬仰，无限热爱。我们祝毛主席万寿无疆。
