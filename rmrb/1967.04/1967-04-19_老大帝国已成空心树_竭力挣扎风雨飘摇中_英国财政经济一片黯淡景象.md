Title: The Once-Great Empire Has Become a Hollow Tree, Struggling Amidst Storms and Shaking in the Wind

The shadow of fiscal and economic crisis looms over the British Isles. The Labour Party government, which has been in power for two and a half years, has barely recovered from the prolonged and severe pound crisis, only to face another perilous situation with declining industrial production and surging unemployment. This situation fully exposes the parasitic and decaying nature of Britain's fiscal and economic system. It shows that as the British colonial empire disintegrates under the impact of revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Britain's fiscal and economic system, which is based on the colonial system, has become a hollow tree, shaking in the wind.

In some key industrial sectors, production has plummeted sharply, with particularly dire situations. For example, steel production last year was 10% lower than the previous year; in December last year, steel production was even 20% lower than the same period the previous year. The production of metal manufacturing last year was 7% lower than the previous year. The coal industry, which has long been in crisis, also saw a 7% reduction in production last year. The automobile industry, one of the main pillars of the British economy, saw a 6% reduction in production last year. Britain's automobile production in the capitalist world has dropped from third to fifth place.

The production of ships last year was more than 20% lower than in 1960. British-built ships once accounted for more than half of the world's new ship tonnage, but last year, the tonnage of ships launched in the capitalist world accounted for only 7.6%.

As production declines, unemployment is rapidly increasing. According to official figures, from last July to this March, the number of unemployed in Britain surged from 260,000 to nearly 570,000, with the particularly severe unemployment situation in Northern Ireland not included.

In the bleak picture of Britain's economy, what particularly worries the ruling class is the bleak prospect of British goods competing in the international market. Last year, its exports to the entire sterling area decreased by 1.5% compared to the previous year. There is still a significant trade deficit with North America and Western Europe.

From 1964 to 1966, over three years, Britain's total international balance of payments deficit reached 1.359 billion pounds. At the same time, during these three years, Britain incurred foreign debts of tens of billions of pounds to cope with the pound crisis, which must be repaid by the end of 1970, with over 300 million pounds due by the end of this year. In addition to long-term debts, foreign creditors hold approximately 5 billion pounds of British short-term bonds, which can be exchanged for gold or dollars at any time.

All these circumstances indicate that Britain not only has not been able to escape the vicious cycle of economic and fiscal crises but has deteriorated to the point where both crises are occurring simultaneously.

    老大帝国已成空心树　竭力挣扎风雨飘摇中
    英国财政经济一片黯淡景象
    财政经济危机的阴霾笼罩着英伦三岛。上台两年半的英国工党政府，在经历了漫长而严酷的英镑危机后惊魂未定，又逢工业生产下降、失业猛增等险象环生的局面。这种情况充分暴露了英国财政经济的寄生性和腐朽性，它表明：随着英殖民帝国在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民革命运动的冲击下加速分崩离析，建基在殖民体系之上的英国财政经济已经成了一株空心大树，处于风雨飘摇之中。
    在一些重要的工业部门，生产急剧下降，情况特别严重。例如，钢的生产去年比前年整整下降了百分之十；而去年十二月钢产量甚至比前年同期低百分之二十。五金制造工业的产量，去年比前年低百分之七。至于长期处在危机之中的煤炭工业，去年也减产百分之七。作为英国经济主要支柱之一的汽车工业，去年减产百分之六。英国在资本主义世界的汽车生产，去年已经从第三位降到第五位。
    船的产量去年比一九六○年低五分之一以上。英国建造的船只曾经占世界新造船舶吨位一半以上，但是去年下水的船舶吨位在资本主义世界中只占百分之七点六。
    在生产下降的同时，失业迅速增加。据官方数字，从去年七月到今年三月，英国失业者从二十六万猛增到近五十七万，而失业情况特别严重的北爱尔兰还不包括在内。
    在英国经济百孔千疮的图景中，特别使统治集团焦虑的是：英国货在国际市场上竞争的前景黯淡。去年，它对整个英镑区的出口比前一年减少了百分之一点五。对北美和西欧大陆的出口也仍然有巨额贸易逆差。
    从一九六四年到一九六六年，三年中英国国际收支逆差总额高达十三亿五千九百万镑。同时，在这三年中，英国为应付英镑危机而欠下了外债十几亿镑，这些债务必须在一九七○年底以前还清，其中有三亿多镑在今年年底以前就必须偿还。除开长期债务外，外国债主手中还有大约五十亿镑的英国短期债券，随时可能要兑换黄金或美元。
    这一切情况表明：英国不但没有能够摆脱经济危机和财政危机交替的恶性循环，而且情况已经恶化到两种危机交集并发的地步。
