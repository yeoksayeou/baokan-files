There are often such cases: investigators catch a thief with his hand in the state's treasury, but the thief is not the least bit frightened. He will grin and joke with the investigators.

The manager of the household goods company in a certain city, Vasili Petrovich Demin, wanted to repair his private residence, but he did not want to spend his own savings. Workers from the company's construction brigade brought paint and various materials to his home, and his private house was repaired, but the state's rubles were spent. After reviewing the materials on this criminal act, the city prosecutor said:

"This is a minor matter, let Vasili Petrovich be handed over to the entire staff for education."

In the household goods company, due to such "minor matters," 3,252 rubles and 16 kopecks were lost in nine months last year: sometimes half a box of soap "disappeared" from the warehouse, sometimes a set of furniture went missing, and sometimes a box of women's shoes was lost.

Investigators requested an inspection. Manager V.P. Demin even dared to complain to the city committee: "They walk around, scare people, and don't let them work."

The city committee heard the thief's complaint and immediately called the investigators:

"What's wrong with you, are you bored? Don't cause trouble!"

In the city, exposing swindlers has even become a dangerous thing. A female salesperson from a bookstore reported various dishonorable behaviors in the bookstore to the "Bureau for Combating Theft of Socialist Property and Speculation," and was immediately fired. Inspector Grinkin exposed a gang of robbers who stole 20,000 rubles from the educational institution of the "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Construction Bureau," and because of this, his turn to move into an apartment was pushed back.

    盗窃分子乐逍遥
    常常有这样的事：侦察机关工作人员抓住了把手伸入国家钱库的小偷，而那个小偷却一点也不惊慌，他会嘻皮笑脸地来同侦察机关工作人员周旋。
    某市日用工业品公司经理瓦西里·彼得罗维奇·杰明要修缮私人住宅，但却不想花自己的积蓄。公司所属的建筑工人把油漆和各种用料带到他的住宅，私人的房子修缮起来了，花掉的却是国家的卢布。市检察长审阅了关于这件犯罪行为的材料之后说：
    “小事一段，把瓦西里·彼得罗维奇交给全体职工教育。”
    在日用工业品公司里，由于这类“小事情”，去年九个月内就损失了三千二百五十二卢布十六戈比：一会儿是半箱香皂从仓库里“消失”了，一会儿是一套家具不见了，一会儿又是一匣女鞋丢失了。
    侦察机关工作人员请求进行检查。经理瓦·彼·杰明竟然敢于向市委诉苦：“他们走来走去，吓唬人，不让人干活。”
    市委听了小偷的诉苦，马上给侦察机关打去电话：
    “你们是怎么的，没事干啦？别找麻烦啦！”
    在城市里揭发骗子手，甚至成为危险的事。有个书店的女营业员向“反盗窃社会主义财产和反投机行为局”报告了书店里各种不光采行为，马上就被解雇了。稽查员格兰金揭发了一群在“古比雪夫水利建设局”保育机关盗窃了二万卢布的强盗集团，因为这个，他登记住宅的次序就被往后挪了。
