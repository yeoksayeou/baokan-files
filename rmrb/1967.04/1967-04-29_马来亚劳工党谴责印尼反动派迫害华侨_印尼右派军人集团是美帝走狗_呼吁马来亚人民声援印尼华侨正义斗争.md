The Malayan Labor Party Central Committee issued a statement on April 26, strongly condemning the Indonesian reactionary government for its extremely savage and inhuman bloodshed in massacring Chinese residents in Indonesia.

The statement pointed out that the large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities currently occurring in Indonesia are entirely under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionary government. The facts have proven that the Indonesian right-wing military clique has become a complete tool and puppet of U.S. imperialism in pushing its anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese, and anti-people policies in Indonesia and around the world.

The statement said that since the Indonesian right-wing military clique launched a counter-revolutionary coup and seized power, it has been continuously arresting and massacring Indonesian patriots and Chinese residents in Indonesia. To date, tens of thousands of Indonesian people and overseas Chinese have been massacred by the Indonesian right-wing military clique, millions of Indonesian people and overseas Chinese have been tortured and imprisoned, and countless homes and properties have been burned down. These bloody atrocities have exposed the fascist nature and reactionary essence of the Suharto right-wing military clique.

The statement calls on the people of Malaya to closely monitor the developments in Indonesian politics and anti-Chinese incidents, and to support the just struggle of the Indonesian people and Chinese residents in Indonesia in every way.

The statement warns that the Indonesian reactionary government must immediately stop its evil deeds; otherwise, it must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

    马来亚劳工党谴责印尼反动派迫害华侨
    印尼右派军人集团是美帝走狗
    呼吁马来亚人民声援印尼华侨正义斗争
    新华社二十八日讯  吉隆坡消息：据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚劳工党中央委员会二十六日发表声明，强烈谴责印尼反动政府以极端野蛮和惨无人道的血腥手段，大肆屠杀旅居印尼的中国侨民的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，目前在印尼出现的大规模的反华排华活动，完全是在美帝国主义和印尼反动政府指使下发生的。事实证明，印尼右派军人集团已经彻头彻尾地成为美帝国主义在印尼和世界各地推行反华排华与反人民政策的走卒和傀儡。
    声明说，自从印尼右派军人集团发动反革命政变夺取政权以来，它就不断地大肆逮捕和屠杀印尼爱国人士和旅居印尼的华侨，到目前为止，已有几十万印尼人民和华侨遭到印尼右派军人集团的屠杀，几百万印尼人民和华侨被拷打和监禁，无数的房屋和财产被烧毁，这些血腥暴行，赤裸裸地暴露了苏哈托右派军人集团的法西斯嘴脸和反动本质。
    声明呼吁马来亚人民严密注视印尼政局和反华排华事件的发展，要在各个方面声援印尼人民和旅居印尼的华侨的正义斗争。
    声明警告印尼反动政府必须立即停止它们的罪恶行为，否则必须担负由此而产生的一切后果。
