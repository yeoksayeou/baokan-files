The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has expressed the strongest protest against the Indonesian reactionaries for creating another bloody incident of persecution against the Chinese.

The reactionary military regime in Indonesia has gone so far as to brutally murder Mr. Ning Xiangyu, an elderly member of the Jakarta Chinese Association.

The New China News Agency reported on the 19th that the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on April 18, expressing great indignation and strongly protesting the serious incident of the Indonesian government's persecution of the Chinese resident Ning Xiangyu in Jakarta, which resulted in his death.

On April 8, Ning Xiangyu, an elderly Chinese resident in his sixties who was a member of the Jakarta Chinese Association and the chairman of the Shandong Association, was illegally summoned and detained by the Indonesian police on trumped-up charges. Ning Xiangyu died in prison on April 13 after being severely tortured.

The note pointed out: Ning Xiangyu has resided in Jakarta for nearly thirty years and has always maintained friendly relations with the local people. The Indonesian reactionaries have gone so far as to commit this heinous act of brutality. This incident only further exposes the Indonesian reactionaries' crazy anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment.

The note pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary authorities have not been able to provide any "evidence" or explanation for why they detained and tortured Ning Xiangyu. The problem is clear: Ning Xiangyu is completely innocent. The Indonesian reactionary authorities, in order to achieve their evil goals of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment, have fabricated outrageous lies to slander the broad Chinese community, especially those who have held positions in Chinese welfare organizations. They have been illegally summoned and arbitrarily arrested on trumped-up charges, subjected to political persecution. The persecution of Ning Xiangyu is just one of the more serious and brutal incidents in a series of such events.

The note warned the Indonesian government: "All your evil acts of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment will inevitably result in harming yourselves. The 700 million Chinese people will never tolerate your continuous bloody crimes against innocent Chinese residents. Your inhuman fascist atrocities will not only provoke strong resistance from the broad Chinese community but will also inevitably face the resolute opposition of the Indonesian people and the just condemnation of the people of the world."

The note firmly demands that the Indonesian government immediately apologize publicly for the above serious incident, give a serious explanation for Ning Xiangyu's death; severely punish the perpetrators and instigators; compensate the family of the deceased; ensure the safety of the funeral activities and bear all funeral expenses; stop all evil activities of persecuting Chinese residents and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will be fully responsible for all serious consequences that may arise.

The New China News Agency reported on the 19th that just a few days after the bloody incident of the East Java authorities shooting the patriotic Chinese resident Huang Jianmin, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia committed another heinous crime in Jakarta, resulting in the death of the Chinese resident Ning Xiangyu.

On April 8, Ning Xiangyu, an elderly Chinese resident in his sixties who was a member of the Jakarta Chinese Association and the chairman of the Shandong Association, was illegally summoned and detained by the Indonesian police on trumped-up charges. Ning Xiangyu died in prison on April 13 after being severely tortured. When his relatives heard the news and went to the prison to visit him, they were rudely stopped by the police authorities. But on the afternoon of April 14 at around 4 o'clock, the police authorities suddenly announced: "Ning Xiangyu has died." When the relatives of the deceased demanded that the police authorities explain Ning Xiangyu's death, they were unreasonably refused, and even the basic request to visit and collect the body was deliberately delayed for two days.

The right-wing military authorities in Indonesia, guilty of their crimes, used various tricks and lies to cover up their crimes. The police authorities initially hid the news of the death, delayed time, and fabricated lies, trying to blame the relatives of Ning Xiangyu for the "poisoned" food sent to him. Later, they fabricated the lie that Ning Xiangyu "ran into the wall" and committed suicide. Finally, they concocted a huge lie, saying that Ning Xiangyu was scalded to death by "boiling water for making coffee," which was "at most only two and a half liters," poured from his head.

On April 16, the Chinese consul and representatives from the Indonesian police department, along with the relatives of the deceased, jointly examined the body. They unanimously confirmed that there were no signs of burns on the head and limbs of the deceased, but the front and back of the chest were covered with bruises and wounds. On the 17th, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry was forced to summon the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, and attempted to shift and evade the responsibility for the murder of Ning Xiangyu according to the "materials" provided by the police department. Xu Ren immediately pointed out in a righteous and stern manner: fabricated things cannot be self-explanatory, but can only further confirm that the police department is the culprit in the persecution of Ning Xiangyu. He strongly refuted the political slander of the Indonesian reactionaries against Ning Xiangyu and pointed out that the despicable actions of the Indonesian authorities were for the need of anti-Chinese sentiment. The Indonesian police authorities, fearing that their heinous crimes would be exposed, resorted to despicable means, deceiving and threatening the relatives of the deceased, saying, "The person is already dead. If you have any difficulties, the police department can help, but you must not report to the Chinese Embassy. If the matter is made public, it will not be good, otherwise, you should be careful..." This is precisely the confession of the Indonesian reactionaries.

The heinous crime of the Indonesian reactionaries has aroused great indignation among the broad patriotic Chinese residents in Jakarta. They expressed, "The enemy is so brutal, we can only advance and never retreat," "We have our motherland as our support, we are not afraid of anything!"

### 我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼反动派又制造排华流血事件  印尼反动派以损人开始必将以害己告终  右派军人政权竟丧心病狂地杀害雅加达中华侨团总会理事宁祥雨老人

    我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼反动派又制造排华流血事件
    印尼反动派以损人开始必将以害己告终
    右派军人政权竟丧心病狂地杀害雅加达中华侨团总会理事宁祥雨老人
    新华社十九日讯　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆四月十八日照会印尼共和国外交部，就印尼政府在雅加达制造残害华侨宁祥雨致死的严重事件，表示极大的愤慨，并向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    四月八日，雅加达中华侨团总会理事和山东公会主席、六十多岁的华侨老人宁祥雨被印尼警察部以莫须有的罪名，非法传讯扣押。宁祥雨在监狱中因遭到严刑拷打，于十三日身亡。
    照会指出：宁祥雨侨居雅加达将近三十年之久，一贯与当地人民友好相处。印尼反动派竟丧心病狂地下此毒手、横加残害。这一行径只能进一步暴露出印尼反动派疯狂反华、排华的丑恶嘴脸。
    照会指出，印尼反动当局对它们为什么要扣押和刑讯宁祥雨的问题，至今提不出任何“罪证”，作不出任何交代。问题很明显，因为宁祥雨根本是无罪的，印尼反动当局为了达到反华、排华的罪恶目的，不惜凭空捏造一些耸人听闻的谎言，对广大华侨恣意诽谤，特别对一些曾担任过华侨福利团体工作的负责人，以莫须有的罪名非法传讯，无理逮捕，进行政治陷害。华侨宁祥雨被残害，仅是一系列事件中更为严重、更为残酷的一个事例而已。
    照会正告印尼政府：“你们的一切反华、排华的罪恶行径，都必将是‘以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终’。七亿中国人民对你们不断残害无辜华侨的血腥罪行，是绝对不能容忍的。你们灭绝人性的法西斯暴行，不仅要激起广大华侨的强烈反抗，也必然要遭到印度尼西亚人民的坚决反对和全世界人民的正义谴责。”
    照会坚决要求印尼政府对上述严重事件立即公开道歉，对宁祥雨之死认真作出交代；严惩凶手及主使人；抚恤死者家属；保障丧葬活动的安全，担负全部丧葬费用；停止迫害华侨的一切罪恶活动，并保证不再发生类似事件。否则由此产生的一切严重后果必须由印尼政府完全承担。
    新华社十九日讯　在东爪哇当局枪杀爱国华侨黄健民的血腥事件仅仅几天之后，印度尼西亚右派军人政权又在雅加达犯下了残害华侨宁祥雨致死的滔天罪行。
    四月八日，雅加达中华侨团总会理事和山东公会主席、六十多岁的华侨老人宁祥雨被印度尼西亚警察部以莫须有的罪名，非法传讯扣押。宁祥雨在监狱中因遭到严刑拷打，于十三日身亡。他的亲友闻讯前往监狱探视时，竟遭到警察当局的蛮横阻拦。但四月十四日下午四时许，警察当局又突然通知说：“宁祥雨已经死亡”。当死者的亲友们要求警察当局对宁祥雨之死作出交代时，又遭到无理拒绝，甚至连看望和收殓尸体的起码要求也被故意拖延两天之久。
    印度尼西亚右派军人当局作贼心虚，施展各种阴谋手段，捏造谎言，妄图掩盖罪行。警察当局起初隐瞒死讯，拖延时间，弄虚作假，妄图以送去的食物“有毒”，嫁祸于宁祥雨的亲友；随后又捏造宁祥雨“碰墙”自杀，最后又编造弥天大谎，说什么宁祥雨是自己用“煮咖啡的”，“充其量不过两公升半”的开水，“从头顶浇下来”烫死的。
    四月十六日，中国领事和印尼警察部代表及死者亲友共同查看了尸体，一致确认死者头部和四肢均无任何烫伤痕迹，而前胸后背则青紫斑斑，伤痕累累。十七日印尼外交部被迫召见中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁，阴谋按照警察部提供的“材料”，推卸和逃避杀害宁祥雨的罪责。徐仁当即义正词严地指出：编造的东西决不能自圆其说，只能更加证实了警察部是残害宁祥雨的元凶。他严厉驳斥了印尼反动派对宁祥雨的政治诬害，并指出印尼当局的卑鄙行径是为了反华的需要。印尼警察当局害怕他们的滔天罪行被揭露，竟耍出卑劣手段，对死者亲友进行诱骗和恫吓，说什么“人已死了，你们如有困难，警察部可以帮助，但是千万不要报告中国大使馆，事情闹大了不好，否则你们要小心……”。这正好是印度尼西亚反动派的自供状。
    印尼反动派的这一滔天罪行，引起了雅加达广大爱国华侨的极大愤怒。他们表示，“敌人如此残暴，我们只有前进，决不能后退”，“我们有祖国做靠山，什么也不怕！”
