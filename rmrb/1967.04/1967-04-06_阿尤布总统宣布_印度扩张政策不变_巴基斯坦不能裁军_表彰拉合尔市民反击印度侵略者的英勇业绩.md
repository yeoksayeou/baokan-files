According to a report by the *Pakistan Times* on April 4, Pakistani President Ayub Khan said on April 3, "India's policy is not one that should coexist peacefully with Pakistan. Therefore, how can they ask us to reduce our armed forces?"

In a press conference held in Lahore, he pointed out that the Indian government does not want to seriously discuss the Kashmir issue but instead keeps talking about negotiations to reduce the armed forces of both countries.

He said, "Let us first resolve the Kashmir issue, and then we can talk about reducing our armed forces."

Earlier, local newspapers reported that, at the instigation of the U.S. government, the Indian government had proposed to the Pakistani government that both sides reduce their military personnel, setting a ratio of four to one for the armed forces of the two countries, which would be advantageous to the Indian government. The U.S. imperialists, in order to force Pakistan to accept this ratio that is advantageous to the Indian government, have been exerting various economic pressures on Pakistan.

The editorial in the *Nawa-i-Waqt* of Rawalpindi on April 3 pointed out that after providing India with a large amount of military aid, the U.S. government is now setting a new trap through India to weaken Pakistan's defensive capabilities.

According to a report by the *Pakistan Times* on April 1, Pakistani political observers pointed out that after Pakistan suffered India's aggression in 1965, it cannot take the risk of accepting any ratio that would put its army in a seriously disadvantageous position.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Rawalpindi on April 5, Pakistani President Ayub Khan awarded the highest honor, the "Eternal Crescent," to the city of Lahore on April 4, in recognition of the city's citizens' heroic deeds in resisting Indian aggressors in September 1965.

More than 200,000 citizens of Lahore participated in the award ceremony.

Ayub Khan said at the ceremony that the Pakistani people will spare no sacrifice to defend their national dignity and borders.

He praised the citizens of Lahore for providing various kinds of assistance to the Pakistani army to defend the city and resist the Indian aggressors. He said that during the 17-day battle, this heroic city of Lahore and its brave people added a glorious page to their history.

    阿尤布总统宣布
    印度扩张政策不变　巴基斯坦不能裁军
    表彰拉合尔市民反击印度侵略者的英勇业绩
    新华社拉瓦尔品第四日电　据《巴基斯坦时报》四日报道：巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗三日说：“印度的政策不是这样的政策：它应当同巴基斯坦和平相处。因此，他们怎么能够要求我们裁减我们的武装力量呢？”
    他在拉合尔举行的记者招待会上发表讲话时指出，印度政府不想认真地讨论克什米尔问题，却喋喋不休地谈论印巴两国应当举行裁减武装力量的谈判。
    他说：“让我们先解决克什米尔问题，然后再裁减我们的武装力量。”
    据这里的报纸早些时候报道：在美国政府的鼓动下，印度政府曾经向巴基斯坦政府提出倡议，要求双方减少武装力量的兵员，确定两国武装力量的比例为四比一，这对印度政府有利。美帝国主义为了迫使巴基斯坦接受这个对印度政府有利的比例，一直在对巴基斯坦施加各种经济压力。
    拉瓦尔品第《建设报》在三日发表的社论中指出，美国政府在给印度大量军事援助以后，正在通过印度设下一个新的圈套，来削弱巴基斯坦的防御力量。
    据《巴基斯坦时报》一日报道，巴基斯坦的政治观察家指出，巴基斯坦在一九六五年遭受了印度的侵略之后，决不能冒风险来接受将使它的军队处于严重不利地位的任何比例。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第五日电　巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗四日把最大的荣誉称号“永恒的新月”授予拉合尔城，表彰这座英雄城市的市民在一九六五年九月反击印度侵略者的英勇业绩。
    有二十多万拉合尔市民参加了授予仪式。
    阿尤布·汗在仪式上讲话说，巴基斯坦人民将不惜一切牺牲来保卫民族尊严和边疆。
    他赞扬拉合尔市民给予巴基斯坦军队以各种帮助，来保卫这座城市，反击印度侵略者。他说，在历时十七天的战斗期间，拉合尔这座英雄城市及其英勇的人民为他们的历史增添了光荣的一页。
