In the great proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, I received the most profound education. Chairman Mao's brilliant and correct leadership, the supervision and assistance of the broad revolutionary masses, have strengthened my revolutionary will, ignited my revolutionary spirit, and resolved me to stand with the proletarian revolutionary faction, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution.

Consciously regarding oneself as the object of revolution
Because my bourgeois worldview has not been fundamentally transformed, in the early stages of the cultural revolution, I did not understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At that time, I thought: the War of Resistance Against Japan was to fight the Japanese devils, the War of Liberation was to fight Chiang Kai-shek, land reform was to struggle against landlords, the Anti-Rightist Campaign was to counter the arrogant attacks of the bourgeois rightists. This cultural revolution, I naturally assumed, was about rooting out rightists among the masses. I only saw myself as a revolutionary force and did not see myself as an object of revolution. Therefore, I only wanted to criticize others and not myself. As a result, I stood on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, did not trust the masses, did not rely on the masses, did not respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and suppressed the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm. When revolutionary teachers and students at the railway middle school launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the school who were taking the capitalist road, I did not support the revolutionary actions of the teachers and students. When workers and students demanded to make revolutionary connections, I agreed with and supported the original party committee's erroneous decision to "persuade students not to make connections."

The revolutionary masses saw my errors clearly. To shake my soul and burn away my errors, to make me quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they posted over a hundred big-character posters on me and conducted multiple exposures and criticisms from last August. Although I had no hostile attitude, my mood was not pleasant. I took this problem to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" Chairman Mao's teachings made my mind clearer. Later, I repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" and, through practice, further realized that the revolutionary masses' thorough exposure and criticism of cadres is not to overthrow me but to help me stand up and better follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. Although there were some excessive words, they came from a hatred of my errors and a concern for my politics. Therefore, my mood became more pleasant.

Bravely accepting the test
How to correct my errors and make up for the losses I caused the Party? I took this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser. We can do things better. Any party, any individual, errors are inevitable. We hope to make fewer. Once errors are made, we must correct them, the quicker and more thoroughly, the better." On the one hand, I checked and admitted my errors to the revolutionary masses, resolving to "abandon the old and seek the new." On the other hand, I used my experiences to do ideological work with other members of the party committee. In August last year, out of indignation, the masses criticized us. Another vice-secretary was very dissatisfied, saying this was a "counter-revolutionary incident" and wanted to go to Beijing to report it. I pointed out his error, saying, "If you do not correct it, you will make things worse." As a result, he gave up his plan to go to Beijing to report. The acting secretary of the original bureau party committee, after the masses exposed his errors, not only did not admit them but also abandoned his work and wanted to report to the railway department party committee and resign. I also gave him a serious criticism.

Just as the original party committee was in a state of paralysis, I thought that the Party had nurtured and educated me for decades, and at this critical moment, I must muster my courage and work even harder for the Party. At that time, it was the peak period of transporting Red Guards. I felt that the Red Guards were Chairman Mao's little red soldiers and must be safely sent to Beijing to see Chairman Mao and safely brought back to make revolution. Although sometimes I was criticized in meetings during the day, my heart was still thinking about whether the special train to Beijing had left? As soon as the meeting ended, I rushed to the station. To solve the urgent transportation problem, I also made active suggestions to the proletarian revolutionary faction, offering ideas and methods to concentrate vehicles and open special trains. To thoroughly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I must honestly check my errors, most resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the red rebels, be a student of theirs, stand with them, and follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. At that time, a handful of power-holders within the bureau who were taking the capitalist road and those who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, to save themselves, used tricks of one kind in the open and another in secret, attempting to lead a serious political struggle astray. They stirred up a counter-revolutionary wave of economism. I saw that if things continued this way, the direction of the movement would inevitably be reversed, allowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road to escape the struggle. Thus, in the middle of the night, I went to find a deputy director who was inciting some workers to economism, demanding that he correct his errors. He, however, feigned illness and did not come out. Next, I suggested convening a party committee meeting to check with all revolutionary workers in the bureau, admit this error, and stop the economism wave. However, some people with ulterior motives within the party committee used the party committee meeting to put pressure on me. Some said, "Workers' wages are low and should be taken care of." Others said, "Reduce the profit remittance a bit, solve some problems for the workers!" They used money and materials to buy hearts everywhere, corrupting the revolutionary will of the masses. Some deceived masses did not understand that this was a trick played by the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, mistakenly thinking that I was an "obstacle," and therefore looked for me to sign vouchers everywhere. I repeatedly propagated the Party's policies to them, reminding them not to be deceived. Just as I had persuaded this group, another group came to ask me to sign this and that. Some workers in the parts factory who did not understand the truth questioned me, "Deputy Director X has already signed a year's health allowance for me, why are you so stubborn and do not sign?" But I still insisted on not signing. I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Policy and strategy are the life of the Party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention and never be careless." This made me withstand the counter-revolutionary wave of economism.

Resolutely opposing the power-holders taking the capitalist road
In the past, I had a very wrong idea, lacking class analysis of the issues among the original party committee members, thinking it best for everyone to check themselves and stand out, hoping everyone would consciously make revolution, without needing others to expose. But things did not go as wished. Some people were afraid to come out, and even obvious errors were not admitted, let alone digging out the dirty things deep in the soul. What was the reason? I still asked Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall." A true revolutionary, "must not neglect to unite with our true friends to attack our true enemies." Chairman Mao's teachings further strengthened my class struggle awareness. The idea of letting everyone come out together was a lack of class analysis and a detached fantasy from reality. "So many things, always urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for the morning and evening." I could not hesitate any longer. At the "It is reasonable to rebel" meeting of bureau cadres, I resolutely stood out to oppose the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, and also opposed the "self" in my mind. At that time, some people, seeing me come out, tried to push some major errors onto me to shut my mouth. For example, the deputy director who promoted economism reversed black and white, pushing the responsibility onto me. Seeing this plot, I repeatedly thought in my heart: Chairman Mao taught us, "The masses are the true heroes." I believe the masses understand the situation best and will definitely see through this plot. As a result, it was the masses who exposed this plot, making some people with ulterior motives lift the stone to hit their own feet. Also, in some cases where the lid had not been lifted and the truth had not been clarified, the masses might misunderstand me. In such situations, I always repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can do nothing." I regarded the masses' misunderstanding as a temporary phenomenon, with not a trace of grievance or resentment, completely believing that the masses are reasonable.

In the process of cadres coming out, the red rebels gave me a correct conclusion. Not only did they give me the opportunity to correct my errors, but they also fully trusted me. Chairman Mao said: "You must have politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the great proletarian cultural revolution better." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I resolved to put down my pride, humbly be a student. I moved my luggage to the revolutionary committee, working and living with the red rebels, jointly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and actively establishing a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in our bureau is getting better and better, but it is still far from the Party's requirements. I must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, in the great proletarian cultural revolution mass movement, shake my soul, transform my bourgeois worldview, maintain my revolutionary integrity, and strive for the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and for the Harbin Railway Bureau to become a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

    同革命群众站在一起自觉闹革命
    原哈尔滨铁路局党委副书记、局长　黎波涛
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动中，我受到了一次最深刻的教育。毛主席英明正确的领导，广大革命群众的监督和帮助，使我坚定了革命意志，激发了革命干劲，下定决心同无产阶级革命派站在一起，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    自觉地把自己当作革命的对象
    由于我的资产阶级世界观没有得到根本改造，因此，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，我对毛主席的革命路线很不理解。当时我想：抗日战争是打日本鬼子，解放战争是打蒋介石，土改是斗地主，反右是反击资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻。这次文化大革命也就想当然地认为是在群众中抓右派分子。只把自己看成是革命的力量，没有同时看成是革命的对象，因此只想整别人，不想整自己。这样一来，我就站到了资产阶级反动路线一边，不相信群众，不依靠群众，不尊重群众的首创精神，压制了群众的革命积极性。当铁路中学革命师生，向学校党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火时，我对革命师生的革命行动没有支持，工人学生要求搞革命串连，我又同意和支持了原党委的“劝说学生不要串连”的错误决定。
    革命群众对我的错误是看得一清二楚的。为了狠触我的灵魂，烧掉我身上的错误，使我迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来，从去年八月他们给我贴了上百张大字报，进行了多次揭发批判。我虽然没有对立情绪，但是心情并不舒畅。我就带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”毛主席的教导使我思想上开朗了一些。后来我又反复地学习了“十六条”。并在实践中进一步认识到，革命群众对干部进行充分的揭发批判，并不是要把我打倒，而是满腔热情地帮助我站出来，更好地跟着毛主席闹革命。尽管有些过头的语言，那是出于对我的错误的憎恨，出于对我政治上的关怀。因此，我的心情就比较舒畅了。
    勇敢地接受考验
    怎样改正错误，弥补自己给党造成的损失呢？我带着这个问题又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我一方面向革命群众检查承认了自己的错误，决心“弃旧图新”，一方面用我的体会去做别的党委常委的思想工作。去年八月间，群众出于义愤，对我们进行了批判。另一个副书记对此非常不满，说这是“反革命事件”，并要到北京去告状。我指出了他的错误，说：“如果不改正就要错上加错”。结果使他放弃了进京告状的打算。原局党委代理书记，在群众揭发他的错误后，不但不承认错误，而且还放弃工作，要向铁道部党委打报告，辞职。对此我也作了严肃的批评。
    就在原党委处于瘫痪的情况下，我想党培养教育我几十年，在关键的时刻，我必须鼓足勇气，加倍地为党工作。那时正处于运送红卫兵的紧张阶段，我觉得红卫兵是毛主席的红小兵，必须把他们安全地送到北京去见毛主席，把他们安全地接回来闹革命。虽然有时白天开大会批判我，但我的心仍然想着进京专车开出去没有？会一散，我就往车站跑。为了解决紧张的运输问题，我还向无产阶级革命派提出积极建议，出主意想办法集中车辆，加开专车。我要彻底回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就必须老老实实检查自己所犯的错误，最坚决地支持红色造反者的革命行动，当红色造反者的小学生，同他们站在一起，跟着毛主席干革命。这时局党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为了保自己，采用阴一套、阳一套的鬼把戏，妄图把一场严肃的政治斗争引到邪路上去，他们刮起了一阵反革命经济主义黑风。我看到这样搞下去，势必扭转运动的大方向，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派借以逃避斗争。于是，半夜里我就去找挑动部分职工闹经济主义的一个副局长，要他检查错误。他却抱病不出。接着，我又建议召开党委会，向全局革命职工做检查，承认这一错误，以煞住经济主义黑风。可是，党委内部一些别有用心的人，却利用党委会向我施加压力。有的人说：“工人工资低，应当照顾。”有的说：“上缴利润少交点吧，给工人解决解决嘛！”他们到处用金钱物资收买人心，腐蚀群众的革命意志。少数受蒙蔽的群众不了解这是党内走资本主义道路当权派玩弄的阴谋，误认为我是个“绊脚石”，因此，四处找我批条子。我就反复向他们宣传党的政策，提醒他们不要上当。刚把这伙说服了，又有几伙要我批这批那。配件厂的一些不明真相的群众质问我：“×副局长已经给我批了一年的保健费了，你为什么这样顽固不批。”但我还是坚持不批。我牢记毛主席的教导：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”使我顶住了反革命经济主义黑风。
    坚决地造走资本主义道路当权派的反
    过去我有一个非常错误的想法，对原党委常委之间的问题缺乏阶级分析，认为最好是各自检查，一起站出来，希望都能自觉革命，用不着等人家揭发。但是，事与愿违，有的人就怕亮相，甚至明摆着的错误也不承认，更不用说挖灵魂深处肮脏的东西了。这是什么原因呢？我还是向毛主席请教。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”一个真正的革命者，“不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”毛主席的教导使我进一步增强了阶级斗争观念，企图让大家一起站出来，这是缺乏阶级分析而又脱离实际的幻想。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”我不能再犹豫徘徊了。在局机关干部造反有理大会上，我毅然决然地站出来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，也造了我头脑里“私”字的反。当时，有的人看我站出来了，就企图把一些重大的错误往我身上推，以便封住我的嘴。比如，搞经济主义的副局长颠倒黑白，把责任推到我身上。我看到了这个阴谋，心中反复想：毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。我相信群众最了解情况，群众一定能识破这一阴谋的。结果，正是群众揭穿了这个阴谋，使一些别有用心的人自己搬起石头砸了自己的脚。另外，在有些问题盖子没有揭开，真相没有弄清之前，群众可能会对自己产生误会。在这种情况下，我总是反复学习毛主席的教导：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”我把群众的误解看成是暂时的现象，没有丝毫的委屈和埋怨情绪，完全相信群众是通情达理的。
    在干部亮相过程中，红色造反者为我做出了正确的结论。不仅给了我改正错误的机会，而且对我充分信任。毛主席说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”根据毛主席的教导，我决心放下架子，甘当小学生。我把行李卷搬到革命委员会里，和红色造反者一起工作、一起生活，共同活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，积极健全革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    目前我局革命和生产形势越来越好，但是距离党的要求还相差很远。我一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，在无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动洪流中，狠触灵魂，改造资产阶级世界观，保持革命的晚节，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为把哈尔滨铁路局办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗！
