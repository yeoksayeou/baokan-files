Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Millions upon millions of people are cheering and singing joyfully. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. The feature-length color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China," which the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have longed to see, began screening today. The film truthfully recreates the touching scenes of Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses being of one heart and mind, greatly inspiring the revolutionary fervor of the broad revolutionary masses, and encouraging them to denounce and expose the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, April 18: Amid the nationwide denunciation of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and under the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a triumphant song of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has been heard: the feature-length color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China," which the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have longed to see, began screening today in the capital and in various parts of the country. This is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great joy for the revolutionary people of the entire nation!

During the filming of this documentary, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party engaged in counter-revolutionary conspiracies. They used their authority to glorify the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line in the film, attempting to belittle the brilliant image of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. However, their plots failed. The proletarian revolutionaries rose up to rebel against them, seized back the right to edit the film of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, broke through numerous difficulties, and finally completed this film, which shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

A red sun rises in the east, and golden rays shine brightly. The first scene on the screen is the brilliant image of the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, whom they yearn for day and night! As the audience recites together with the narrator, "You should concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," the screen shows one fiery scene of struggle after another: revolutionary teachers and students use the four weapons to launch fierce attacks on a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary academic authorities of the bourgeoisie; Red Guard youths take to the streets to smash the Four Olds of the bourgeoisie and establish the Four News of the proletariat; the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers stand firm at their posts, seize the revolution and promote production, and good news of victories comes from every front. It is under this excellent revolutionary situation that 150,000 revolutionary youths and revolutionary masses from the capital and various regions and nationalities across the country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, bring the rich fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to accept the inspection of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

The music of "The East Is Red" plays, and the most joyful moment arrives. Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao stride up to Tiananmen Gate. Look, Chairman Mao's face is radiant, and he is beaming as he waves to us! Look, Tiananmen Square, dyed red by red flags and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," is boiling over! How many people are cheering and singing joyfully, how many people are shedding tears of excitement! Millions upon millions of fiery hearts turn toward the red sun on Tiananmen Gate, and millions upon millions of people sing "The Boat Needs a Helm" and "Father and Mother Are Dear, but Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" in unison. The cheers of millions upon millions of people merge into a thunderous wave: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! We will defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao with our lives!"

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, addresses the revolutionary masses who are accepting the inspection, saying: "Chairman Mao has long pointed out that throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there is a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage in the struggle between these two classes and two roads. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois anti-revolutionary line continues. Those who insist on the wrong line are only a handful of people. They are detached from the people, oppose the people, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which determines that they will definitely fail."

The audience sees clearly that during the more than six-hour-long National Day parade, Chairman Mao is always on Tiananmen Gate, inspecting the 150,000 Cultural Revolution armies. After the parade ends, Chairman Mao walks down from Tiananmen Gate, crosses the Golden Water Bridge, and walks among the crowds to congratulate everyone on the festival. Especially moving is that on the night of the National Day, when the fireworks are dazzling and the crowds are in high spirits, Chairman Mao walks across the Golden Water Bridge again, sits down among the revolutionary masses, and celebrates the festival with everyone. The entire film, with numerous scenes, truthfully recreates the touching scenes of Chairman Mao being among the revolutionary masses and Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses being of one heart and mind, showing that hundreds of millions of people love, trust, and worship Chairman Mao limitlessly, while Chairman Mao always trusts the masses fully, shares their breath, shares their destiny, and supports the revolutionary mass movement wholeheartedly.

The film also includes scenes of workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, representatives of ethnic minorities, and international friends such as Xie Xiuying, A. F. Hill, Dacru, Kuroda Jutaro, and Robert Williams speaking at the celebration rally. The speakers, from different professions, nationalities, and countries, express the common voice of the revolutionary people of the whole of China and the whole world: Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts! Following Mao Zedong, we will forever make revolution! Following Mao Zedong, the world will be red!

The feature-length color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" was jointly produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and the August First Film Studio with the enthusiastic assistance of the Red Guard youths.

The workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in the capital who saw the preview of this film were greatly inspired. They said, at the present time when the broad revolutionary masses are rising up to criticize the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and when revolutionary people throughout China and the world are cheering in unison for the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, we love, are loyal to, believe in, and worship our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, who never sets, even more. At this time, being able to see our most, most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao on the screen is our greatest happiness. They excitedly expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, denounce and expose the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, complete the great historical task of struggle-criticism-transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    千千万万人欢呼跳跃　千千万万人纵情歌唱
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳
    亿万革命人民渴望已久的一九六六年国庆节大型彩色文献纪录片开始上映。影片真实地再现了毛主席和革命群众心连心的动人情景，极大地激励了广大革命群众的斗志，鼓舞了他们把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭、把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。
    新华社十八日讯　在举国声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战鼓声中，在无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势下，传来了一曲毛主席革命路线的胜利凯歌：亿万革命人民渴望已久的大型彩色文献纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年》，今天起在首都和全国各地陆续上映。这是毛泽东思想的新胜利，这是全国革命人民的大喜事！
    这部影片在摄制过程中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞反革命的阴谋活动。他们利用职权，在影片中大肆美化党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，大肆美化资产阶级反动路线，妄图贬低我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。但是，他们的阴谋没有得逞。无产阶级革命派起来造了他们的反，从他们手里夺回了编制毛主席接见红卫兵和革命群众的影片的大权，冲破重重困难，终于把这部闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的影片编制成功。
    一轮红日东升，万道金光灿灿。银幕上映现出来的第一个镜头，就是广大革命群众日夜思念的革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉形象！当人们和讲解员一起诵读“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导时，银幕上展现出一个个火热的斗争场景：革命师生运用四大武器，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、向资产阶级反动学术权威猛烈开火；红卫兵小将走上街头，大破资产阶级四旧，大立无产阶级四新；广大工农兵坚守岗位，抓革命，促生产，各条战线捷报频传。就是在这样大好的革命形势下，首都和来自全国各地区各民族的一百五十万革命小将和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，带着无产阶级文化大革命的累累硕果，前来接受我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的检阅。
    《东方红》的乐曲声响了，最幸福的时刻来到了，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志健步登上天安门城楼。看哪，毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，在向我们微笑招手！看哪，由红旗和鲜红的《毛主席语录》映成一片红色海浪的天安门广场沸腾了！多少人在欢呼跳跃，多少人在纵情歌唱，多少人流下了激动的热泪！千千万万颗火热的心向着天安门上的红太阳，千千万万人同声歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》，千千万万人的欢呼声汇成一股震天撼地的声浪：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！”
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志向接受检阅的革命群众发表讲话，他说：“毛主席早就指出，在整个社会主义的历史时期，存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。无产阶级文化大革命，就是这两个阶级、两条道路斗争的新阶段。在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反对革命路线的斗争还在继续。那些坚持错误路线的人，只是一小撮人，他们脱离人民，反对人民，反对毛泽东思想，这就决定了他们一定要失败。”
    观众们看得很清楚，在持续六个多小时的国庆游行中，毛主席一直在天安门城楼上，检阅一百五十万文化革命大军。在游行结束后，毛主席又走下天安门城楼，走过金水桥，走到群众队伍中，向大家祝贺节日。特别令人激动的是，在那焰花瑰丽、万众欢腾的国庆之夜，毛主席又一次走过金水桥，走到革命群众之中，席地而坐，和大家一起欢度佳节。整个影片以大量的镜头真实地再现了毛主席和革命群众在一起，毛主席和革命群众心连心的动人情景，说明亿万人民无限热爱、无限信赖、无限崇拜毛主席，而毛主席又总是充分地信任群众，和群众同呼吸、共命运，全心全意支持革命的群众运动。
    影片还摄入了工农兵、革命师生、少数民族代表和谢氏娇、艾·弗·希尔、达克鲁斯、黑田寿男、罗伯特·威廉等国际友人在庆祝大会上讲话的镜头。讲话的人，行业不同，民族不同，国籍不同，却表达了全中国和全世界革命人民的共同心声：毛主席是我们心中的红太阳！跟着毛泽东，永远闹革命！跟着毛泽东，世界一片红！
    大型彩色文献纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》，是由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂和八一电影制片厂在红卫兵小将的热情协助下摄制完成的。
    首都工农兵、革命师生和革命干部看到这部影片的预映，受到了巨大鼓舞。他们说，当前，在广大革命群众奋起批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的时候，在全中国、全世界革命人民同声欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的时候，我们对我们心中永远不落的红太阳毛主席，更加热爱，更加忠诚，更加信仰，更加崇拜。在这样的时候，能够从银幕上见到我们最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，这是我们最大的幸福。他们激动地表示，一定要更高地举起毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把我国党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，完成斗批改的伟大历史任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
