The White House spokesman announced on the 6th that Abrams, the defeated general of the U.S. invasion of Korea and the current U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff, has been appointed as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam. This is one of the measures taken by Johnson to strengthen the command structure of the U.S. forces in Vietnam in order to escalate the war further.

After being appointed, Abrams immediately engaged in war-mongering at a press conference, stating that the U.S. government's policy has always been to fully supply the military leaders in Vietnam with the necessary troops. At the same press conference, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Vance announced that the current number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam has reached 435,000. He also revealed that the U.S. will continue to send more troops to South Vietnam this year.

Previously, Johnson appointed Palmer, the butcher who suppressed the people of the Dominican Republic, as the commander of the U.S. Second Field Force in Vietnam.

The U.S. imperialists, under the blows of the heroic Vietnamese people, frequently adjust their military structures in Vietnam, but the more they adjust, the more they fail. The recent series of adjustments are a sign that they are facing even greater failures.

    侵朝败将给侵越败将作帮手
    美陆军副参谋长艾布拉姆斯任侵越美军副司令
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国白宫发言人六日宣布，美国侵朝战争的败将、现任美国陆军副参谋长艾布拉姆斯被任命为侵越美军副司令。这是约翰逊为加强侵越美军的指挥机构，以便进行新的战争升级而采取的措施之一。
    艾布拉姆斯刚被任命后，就在一次记者招待会上进行战争叫嚣，他说，美国政府的政策从来就是充分供应在越南的美军头目所需要的兵力。在同一次记者招待会上，美国国防部副部长万斯宣布，目前美国在南越的军队总数已经达到四十三万五千人。他还透露美国将在今年内继续向南越增派军队。
    在此以前，约翰逊任命镇压多米尼加人民的刽子手帕尔默为侵越美军第二野战部队司令。
    美帝国主义在英雄的越南人民的打击下，经常调整侵越军事机构，但是越调越败，最近的一系列调整则是它面临更大失败的征兆。
