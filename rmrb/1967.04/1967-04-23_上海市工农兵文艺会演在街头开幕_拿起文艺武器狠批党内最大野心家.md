"Pick up all cultural weapons to severely criticize the biggest careerist within the Party!" The cultural performance by Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers, jointly organized by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 20 other revolutionary mass organizations, began on April 20th on the streets of Shanghai.

This grand and clear-cut cultural performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers is a revolutionary critique launched by the revolutionary masses of Shanghai, using cultural weapons, against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. The worker, peasant, and soldier cultural warriors participating in the performance most enthusiastically praised our dearest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Through the performance, the revolutionary masses of the entire city are further mobilized to achieve great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism.

Over the past two days, more than 100 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, composed of soldiers from the three military units stationed in Shanghai, revolutionary workers, commune members, and students, have carried Mao Zedong's giant portrait, held high red flags, and beaten war drums, marching vigorously onto the streets. They performed in 25 open-air stages set up in the city center's People's Square, near factories, schools, and rural towns. They sang Mao Zedong's quotations with fervor and performed revolutionary spirit-filled pieces such as "Firing at China's Khrushchev," "Defending the Proletarian Revolutionary Line Represented by Chairman Mao," "Criticizing 'Temperament,'" and "All Red Guards in Shanghai Unite!" and hundreds of other battle-themed performances in various artistic forms. The East is Red propaganda team from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from Factory 4046, among many other mass cultural warriors, were overjoyed upon hearing the news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. They created and performed songs and dances on the same day to celebrate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The performances by workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guard youths are derived from their fiery struggles. They write and perform their own works without any restrictions, and their creations are the most revolutionary and full of vitality. Many performances, with their strong political content, deeply moved the broad audience, blending the stage and the audience into one. The audience could not help but join the performers in repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Down with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand years live our dearest Red Sun, Chairman Mao!"

The Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers' cultural army, who have grown up in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the revolutionary general front." In this current intense revolution of great criticism and struggle, they dare to be the vanguards on the cultural front.

Over the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially in the current great criticism, they have come to realize more clearly that Mao Zedong's cultural thoughts have long been unable to be implemented, anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds have been spreading, and the direction of the mass cultural troops has once deviated, all due to the sabotage by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, who is preparing for a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. They believe that the proletarian revolutionaries should shout loudly on the revolutionary political stage and sing and dance loudly on the revolutionary cultural stage. They are determined to reverse the historical inversion where a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and various bourgeois academic "authorities" have long dominated the cultural stage. They are determined to use cultural weapons in this performance to strongly portray the image of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guard youths denouncing China's Khrushchev, "helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy."

The Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers' cultural performance will be continuously performed on street open-air stages for six days. After the street performances end, these more than 100 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams will use their spare time to tour factories, communes, military units, schools, government agencies, as well as stations, docks, and workers' new villages to perform for revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. The Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers' cultural performance preparation group, during the preparation period, has issued an urgent call to the proletarian revolutionaries on all fronts in the city, to best commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's immortal great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and to mobilize more people to join the battle to overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. They hope that various revolutionary mass organizations can form more small Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, seize spare time, pick up all cultural weapons, deeply enter the masses in the great criticism, thoroughly defeat the anti-revolutionary revisionist cultural thoughts of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and let the boundless red flag of Mao Zedong's cultural thoughts forever fly high in all cultural and artistic fields!

    上海市工农兵文艺会演在街头开幕
    拿起文艺武器狠批党内最大野心家
    新华社上海二十一日电　“拿起一切文艺武器，打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！”由上海工人革命造反总司令部等二十个革命群众组织联合举办的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，上海市工农兵文艺会演”，二十日开始，在上海街头开幕。
    这次规模盛大、旗帜鲜明的工农兵文艺会演，是上海无产阶级革命派联合起来，运用文艺武器，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开的一场革命的大批判。参加会演的工农兵文艺战士最热烈地歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。通过会演，进一步动员全市无产阶级革命派在大批判中实现革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”。
    这两天，由中国人民解放军驻沪三军部队的战士和革命工人、人民公社社员以及学生等组成的一百多个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，抬着毛主席巨幅画像，高举红旗，擂动战鼓，斗志昂扬地奔向街头。他们分别在市中心人民广场以及设在工厂、学校附近和乡村集镇的二十五处露天舞台上，纵情歌唱毛主席语录歌，充满革命豪情地表演了《向中国的赫鲁晓夫开炮》、《坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线》、《批判〈修养〉》、《全市红卫兵联合起来》等数百个各种文艺形式的战斗节目。上海工人革命造反总司令部东方红小分队和四○四六工厂毛泽东思想宣传队等不少群众文艺战士，听到北京市革命委员会成立的喜讯，万分高兴，当天就创作并演出了歌舞等节目，欢呼北京市革命委员会的成立。工农兵和红卫兵小将们演出的文艺节目，来源于他们火热的斗争生活。他们自编自演，没有框框，创作的节目，最富有革命精神，最富有生命力。许多节目以强烈的政治内容深深感染了广大观众，台上台下打成一片，观众们情不自禁地同演出者一起一次又一次地振臂高呼：“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中成长起来的上海工农兵群众文艺大军念念不忘毛主席的教导：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”在当前这场轰轰烈烈的革命的大批判、大斗争中，他们敢当文艺战线上冲锋陷阵的急先锋。
    他们在最近一年的无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中，特别是在当前的大批判中，更清楚地知道，毛主席的文艺思想长期得不到贯彻，反党反社会主义的大毒草成批出笼，群众文艺队伍的方向一度走上邪路，就是由于党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在捣乱，在搞资本主义反革命复辟的准备。他们认为，无产阶级革命派要在革命的政治舞台上大喊大叫，也要在革命的文艺舞台上大唱大跳。他们决心把党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派和形形色色资产阶级反动学术“权威”长期统治文艺舞台这种历史的颠倒，重新颠倒过来。他们决心在这次会演中，运用文艺武器，大力塑造工农兵和红卫兵小将声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫的战斗形象，“帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”。
    上海市工农兵群众文艺会演将在街头露天舞台连续演出六天。街头演出结束后，这一百多个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，将利用业余时间，分头到工厂、公社、部队、学校、机关以及车站、码头、工人新村的革命群众和革命干部中去进行巡回演出。上海市工农兵文艺会演筹备小组在筹备会演期间，曾向全市各条战线上的无产阶级革命派提出紧急倡议，为了最好地纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇不朽的伟大著作发表二十五周年，为了动员更多的人投入打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的战斗中去，希望各革命群众组织能组成更多的小型的毛泽东思想宣传队，抓紧业余时间，拿起一切文艺武器，在革命的大批判中，深入群众，彻底打垮党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义文艺思想，让光焰无际的毛泽东文艺思想红旗，永远在一切文化艺术领域里高高地飘扬！
