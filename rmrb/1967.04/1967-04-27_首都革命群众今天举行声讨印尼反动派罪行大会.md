The reactionary government of Indonesia, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, has recently launched a frenzied wave of anti-Chinese and anti-China activities, wantonly damaging the relations between the two countries. This has aroused the extreme indignation of the revolutionary masses in the capital.

Revolutionary masses from various sectors in Beijing will hold a rally this afternoon to solemnly denounce the crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in their anti-Chinese and anti-China activities.

Central People's Broadcasting Station will begin broadcasting the live proceedings of the rally at 1:55 PM today using the frequency of the first program. Beijing Television and Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will also broadcast the rally simultaneously.
