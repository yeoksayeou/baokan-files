The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has evoked two diametrically opposed strong reactions throughout the world.

Revolutionary people all over the world have drawn immense inspiration from China's Cultural Revolution, feeling greatly elated. They enthusiastically acclaim, "Good indeed!"

The U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and all international reactionary forces, however, regard the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a flood or a ferocious beast, hating it to the core. They maliciously curse, "Bad indeed."

Two diametrically opposed reactions to the same event. From the standpoint of class struggle, this is entirely normal. From the standpoint of revolution, it is considered excellent; from the standpoint of counterrevolution, it is naturally considered utterly bad. These two diametrically opposed reactions prove a truth, namely: our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct and good. It is precisely because this Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented, most magnificent, and most profound revolution that revolutionary people all over the world enthusiastically praise it and resolutely support it, while imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries vigorously oppose it and frenziedly attack it.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." If our Cultural Revolution did not encounter the enemy's opposition but instead received their praise, how could it be called a revolution? If our Cultural Revolution did not encounter the enemy's hatred and frenzied curses, how could it fully demonstrate that it is a magnificent revolution?

In the international reactionaries' chorus of slandering our Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revisionist leading clique has taken the lead. Their frenzied efforts even surpass those of the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries. This is actually not surprising. Our Cultural Revolution is conducting a thorough criticism of revisionism at home and completely uprooting the roots of revisionism. This is also a fundamental exposure of the Soviet revisionist leading clique. These traitorous elements, relying on their reactionary class instincts, also sense that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great disaster for them. They stop at nothing to block information, distort facts, spread rumors, and maliciously curse, using all their tricks. This precisely reflects that our Cultural Revolution has dealt them a heavy blow, making their days even more difficult.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great innovation in the socialist revolution and a great innovation in the international communist movement. The Soviet revisionist clique's frenzied attacks and opposition can only further expose their counterrevolutionary nature to the Soviet people and people all over the world, and also expose their paper tiger nature. Their slanders and curses will absolutely not hinder the victorious advance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution but will only hasten their own doom.

### “好得很”和“糟得很”

    “好得很”和“糟得很”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命在全世界引起了两种截然相反的强烈反应。
    全世界革命人民从中国文化大革命中受到了巨大鼓舞，感到无比振奋。他们热烈欢呼“好得很！”
    美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和一切国际反动势力，对中国文化大革命则视若洪水猛兽，切齿痛恨。他们恶毒咒骂：“糟得很”。
    对同一件事情，有两种截然不同的反应。从阶级斗争的观点看，这完全是正常现象。站在革命的立场上，觉得是好极了；站在反革命的立场上，就自然认为是坏透了。这两种完全相反的反应说明了一个真理，这就是：我国无产阶级文化大革命做得对，做得好。正是因为这场文化大革命是一场史无前例的、最伟大、最深刻的革命，所以全世界革命人民热情地颂扬它，坚决地拥护它；帝国主义、修正主义和反动派起劲地反对它，疯狂地攻击它。
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。假若我们的文化大革命，不遭到敌人的反对而受到他们的赞扬，那怎么能算得上一场革命呢？假若我们的文化大革命，不遭到敌人的切齿痛恨和疯狂咒骂，那又怎么能充分说明这是一场伟大的革命呢？
    在国际反动势力诽谤我国文化大革命的大合唱中，苏修领导集团充当了急先锋。他们那股疯狂的劲头，甚至于超过了帝国主义和各国反动派。其实，这并不奇怪。我们的文化大革命，在国内对修正主义进行大批判，彻底挖掉修正主义根子，这也是从根本上对苏修领导集团的大揭露。苏修这伙叛徒凭着他们反动的阶级本能，也预感到中国文化大革命对他们是一场大灾难。他们不择手段地封锁消息，歪曲事实，造谣诬蔑，恶毒咒骂，使出了全副看家本领。这恰恰反映了，我国的文化大革命给了他们最沉重的打击，使他们的日子更加不好混了。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义革命的伟大创举，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。苏修集团如此疯狂地攻击和反对，这只能在苏联人民和全世界人民面前，进一步暴露他们的反革命面目，同时也暴露他们的纸老虎本质。他们的诽谤和咒骂，绝对阻挡不了中国文化大革命的胜利前进，只会加速他们自己的灭亡。
