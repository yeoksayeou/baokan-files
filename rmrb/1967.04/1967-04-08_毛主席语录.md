	Chairman Mao pointed out: There are bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles. These are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these individuals have already been exposed by us, some have not, and some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the likes of Khrushchev. They are currently sleeping beside us. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this point.

    毛主席语录
    毛主席指出：混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。
