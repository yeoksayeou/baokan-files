The hand of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party reaches far and wide. It extends not only into the Party, the government, and the military, but also into the cultural sphere.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre (Beijing People's Art Theatre) has been under the control of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists for over a decade. They have staged a large number of poisonous weeds, with foreigners, dead people, emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties dominating the stage, serving the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The chief culprit behind all this is the number one capitalist-roader in the Party.

Cutting down revolutionary cultural troupes and establishing bourgeois art theatres

The predecessor of the Beijing People's Art Theatre was the Cultural Work Team No. 2 of the North China University and the North China People's Cultural Work Team. These cultural troupes entered the city with the liberating army, playing drums and performing folk dances. At that time, the cultural troupes, following the teachings of Chairman Mao: "To make art a good component of the entire revolutionary machine, a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy," went deep into factories, schools, and streets, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, and also introducing revolutionary art from the liberated areas. The cultural workers established deep class feelings with the workers, students, and laboring masses.

However, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party harbored extreme hostility towards revolutionary, combat-ready, and worker-peasant-soldier-serving cultural troupes. In 1951, he gave a directive to the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang to cut down the cultural troupes. He said: "Cultural troupes can only twist the waist drum and beat the gong, which will harm them. Cultural troupes need to be reorganized, personnel need to be greatly reduced, formal troupes need to be established.... Most of them should be transferred to other jobs.... They should not continue like this." This was a very vicious, programmatic black directive to completely bourgeoisify the art troupes. Due to this vicious directive, many revolutionary and combat-ready cultural troupes across the country were cut down! Many cultural workers who insisted on Chairman Mao's artistic line were slandered as "all-purpose workers," "without expertise, and low in culture," and were "reorganized" out. Some untransformed bourgeois "artists," "famous actors," and some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, however, infiltrated the revolutionary art ranks under the banner of "establishing formal troupes." They became "teachers," "saints," and "examples" once they arrived.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre evolved in this way. A reactionary, stinking bourgeois "authority" actually served as the first deputy director and chief director. This reactionary "authority" regarded himself as China's Stanislavsky, comparing the old party secretary to Danchenko, and wanting to establish a "theatrical art" like the Moscow Art Theatre. He trained actors with "An Actor Prepares," telling them to start from "oneself," absurdly claiming that one could experience a Red Army soldier from a Kuomintang soldier. Thus, the class relations in the theatre were completely reversed, laying the foundation for the number one capitalist-roader in the Party to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the cultural sphere.

Opening the floodgates for capitalism, modern revisionism, and "1930s" art

In 1953, China began its first five-year plan, and the issue of the three major socialist transformations began to be raised. To resist the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the Beijing People's Art Theatre staged a play that beautified the bourgeoisie, advocated "human nature," and promoted class reconciliation, supposedly a "masterpiece since the May Fourth Movement." The capitalist-roader in the Party and the reactionary academic "authority" knew very well that this was a class struggle, a challenge to socialism on the stage. They devoted their hearts and souls, exerting all their efforts to rehearse for eight months. To perform "realistically," the director led the actors and staff to the homes of warlords and social dregs to "experience life," calling old parasites "old masters" and befriending a group of vampires. The rehearsal room was filled with filthy air. They exerted all their strength to bring this play to the stage. Despite their collusion with social ghosts and snakes, writing flattering articles in the "Drama Journal," the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers still opposed it. A combat hero said after watching it: "There is not a single good person in this play, it promotes class reconciliation." The "Drama Journal" also received many critical articles, but they suppressed them and did not publish them. Just as these counter-revolutionary revisionists were trembling with fear, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party came to watch the play. After watching this play that beautified the bourgeoisie, he praised it endlessly, saying: "Deep! Very deep! Extremely deep!" These nine words of evaluation, along with what he said: "Your newspaper only talks about how good the workers are, with no flaws? How bad the capitalists are, with no merits?" "Capitalists have more knowledge than us, they know more than the workers," "We should learn from them," "We should cooperate," "We should unite," are so consistent! The number one capitalist-roader in the Party gave this play a boost, opening the floodgates for capitalism, modern revisionism, and 1930s plays across the country. Thus, a large number of poisonous weeds flooded the market, and the socialist stage was dominated by "dead people" and "foreigners."

Over the past decade, many of the plays performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre have closely followed the counter-revolutionary tide. During the anti-rightist struggle, when the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was fighting against the rightist Wu Zuoliang, the nearby Capital Theatre was performing his play "Snowy Night Return," which summoned the spirits of the Chiang family dynasty; to resist the learning from Lei Feng and the nationwide study of the People's Liberation Army, in 1963, they performed the big poisonous weed "Li Guorui," which defamed the Eighth Route Army; to cooperate with "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" and "Li Huiming," in 1963, they re-staged the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tian Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist play "Guan Hanqing" for the second time....

Opposing Chairman Mao's instructions, waving the "red flag" against the red flag

In September 1962, the great leader Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, raised the issue of never forgetting class struggle. He taught us: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.

In 1963, Chairman Mao further pointed out to the cultural sphere: Various forms of art—drama, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and socialist transformation in many fields has so far been ineffective. Many fields are still dominated by "dead people." Many communists enthusiastically advocate feudalist and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about advocating socialist art, which is truly astonishing.

Chairman Mao's wise instructions hit the nail on the head, striking at the vital point of the counter-revolutionary revisionist cultural line's backstage boss. He immediately panicked and hastily convened a cultural symposium on January 3, 1964. At the meeting, he said that the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the cultural sphere was just an "organizational problem," caused by "unclear" understanding and "loose" work, and that in the future, as long as new things were vigorously "supported" and "affirmed," the problem could be solved. He did not mention the criticism and counterattack against poisonous weeds but talked about the so-called "establishment," treating the creation problem as the main issue. This was a sinister plot.

A few days after the cultural symposium, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party also talked to a writer about many issues regarding "establishment." He did not mention deepening into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor did he mention ideological transformation, but only criticized cultural workers for fearing to make mistakes, daring not to write about real class struggles, and daring not to write about erroneous phenomena. What "dare not write about real struggles," "dare not write about erroneous phenomena," this was clearly inciting some people to attack the Party and attack socialism!

The backstage boss issued a black directive, and the old party committee of the Beijing People's Art Theatre immediately complied. The industrial play "Brothers in the Mine" performed in 1964 was created according to his black directive of "daring to write about real struggles" and "daring to write about erroneous phenomena." In this play, the Great Leap Forward was depicted as only caring about quantity, not quality, and going against objective laws, which was in line with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's vicious attacks on the Three Red Banners, slandering the Great Leap Forward as "madness" and "retreat," and that the Three Red Banners could be "doubted for a few years," etc.

Some said that these bourgeois lords, after 1964, "retreated" to cope with the situation. No, they did not retreat at all but used attack as defense, waving the banner of modern plays, and engaged in extensive bourgeois subversive activities. The modern plays performed by our theatre served as the "suicide squad" for the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's attack on the proletariat in the cultural and ideological front, directly serving their evil purpose of counter-revolutionary restoration.

The Poison of the Two "Self-Cultivations"

Over the past decade, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of our theatre have repeatedly fought against the counter-revolutionary revisionist cultural line head-on. Almost every year-end summary, someone would raise the serious question of whether the theatre had implemented Chairman Mao's cultural line. In 1954, during the criticism movement of "Research on Dream of the Red Chamber," revolutionary masses, especially young comrades, had once opened fire on the old party committee for praising bourgeois "authorities" and suppressing new forces, but they were brutally suppressed by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. They labeled the young League members who responded to Chairman Mao's call to rebel as "seizing the leadership from the Party" and "anti-Party."

To cultivate a batch of truly obedient living machines, they brought out the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's "Self-Cultivation" to corrupt people, advocating that "all conditional obedience is wrong, it should be unconditional and absolute obedience," making people their "tame tools." This "Self-Cultivation" and this set of counter-revolutionary revisionist "organizational principles" have long been the talisman of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in our theatre. As long as you raise a sharp opinion, slightly touch this black line, they immediately organize you to study "Self-Cultivation," write self-criticisms, and beautify it as "rectifying" thoughts.

The old party committee of our theatre was very familiar with the counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. While using the "big stick," they also used the "carrot" policy. In the "Twelve-Year Plan" formulated in 1956, they again used first-class directors, first-class actors, first-class stage design, first-class technicians, etc., as bait, making many comrades walk the white specialist road. Some actors held the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's "Self-Cultivation" in their left hand and Stanislavsky's "An Actor Prepares" in their right hand. "Two 'Self-Cultivations' on one shoulder, three names and three highs are the goals," one is the political opium, and one is the artistic opium, they poison people every moment; one is "developing individuality," and one is "starting from oneself," making many people's bourgeois worldviews completely unable to be transformed, and even making some people walk the evil path. The old party committee of the Beijing People's Art Theatre relied on these two "Self-Cultivations" to serve their capitalist restoration.

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has sounded the death knell for the small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party. After ten months of struggle, the revolutionary masses across the country united as one and finally dragged out the number one capitalist-roader in the Party! This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, this is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

We are determined to unite with the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary comrades, fight together, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the Party, and thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist cultural line!

Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the new red proletarian revolutionary cultural front in our country!

    揭露头号野心家在北京人艺的罪行
    北京人民艺术剧院毛泽东思想红卫兵
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑手伸得很长。他不仅伸向党里、政府里、军队里，同时也伸向了文艺界。
    北京人民艺术剧院
  （简称北京人艺）在一小撮反革命修正主义分子的控制下，十几年来上演了大量的毒草，洋人、死人、帝王将相、才子佳人充斥舞台，走的是一条为资产阶级服务，为地、富、反、坏、右服务的道路。
    这一切的罪魁祸首就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    大砍革命的文工团，建立资产阶级的艺术剧院
      北京人艺的前身是华北大学文工二团和华北人民文工团。这两个文工团都是在解放北京的时候，随解放军打着腰鼓，扭着秧歌进城的。当时的文工团按照毛主席的教导：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，深入工厂、学校、街道，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的政策，同时也介绍解放区的革命文艺。文工团员和工人、学生、劳动群众建立了深厚的阶级感情。
      可是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，极端仇视革命化、战斗化、为工农兵服务的文工团。一九五一年，他对反革命修正主义分子周扬作了一个砍掉文工团的“指示”。他说：“文工团就会扭扭秧歌，打打腰鼓，这样下去是害了他们。文工团要整编，人员要大大削减，建立正式的剧团。……大部分让他们转业，……不要这样混下去了。”这是一个十分恶毒的、要把文艺团体完全资产阶级化的纲领性的黑“指示”。由于这个恶毒的“指示”，全国很多具有革命战斗传统的文工团被砍掉了！大批坚持毛主席文艺路线的文艺工作干部被诬蔑为“万金油干部”，“没有专长，文化又低”，而被“整编”掉了。一些没有改造的资产阶级“艺术家”“名演员”和一些地富反坏右分子，却在“建立正式剧团”的口号下混进了革命的文艺队伍。他们来了之后，都变成了“老师”，变成了“圣人”，变成了“榜样”。
    北京人艺就是这样演变过去的。一个反动的、臭透了的资产阶级“权威”居然担任第一副院长兼总导演。这个反动“权威”以中国的史坦尼斯拉夫斯基自居，把旧党委书记比做丹钦科，要建立莫斯科艺术剧院式的“剧场艺术”。他拿《演员自我修养》训练演员，要演员从“自我出发”，胡说什么可以从国民党大兵身上体验红军战士，真是荒谬绝伦。就这样，剧院的阶级关系完全颠倒过来了，这就为党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在文艺界实行资产阶级专政打下了基础。
    为资本主义、现代修正主义和“三十年代”的文艺大开闸门
    一九五三年，我国开始了第一个五年计划，社会主义的三大改造问题开始提出来了。为了配合党内头号走资本主义道路当权派抗拒对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，北京人艺搬出了一个美化资产阶级，鼓吹“人性论”，宣扬阶级调和的所谓“五四以来的优秀剧目”。党内走资本主义道路的当权派和反动的学术“权威”，很懂得这是一场阶级斗争，是在话剧舞台上向社会主义挑战的一次尝试。他们呕心沥血，竭尽全力排练了八个月。为了演得“象”，导演率领演员和工作人员到北洋军阀和许多社会渣滓们的家里去“体验生活”，管老寄生虫叫“老太爷”，和一群吸血鬼打得火热。排练场上，更是一片污浊空气。他们费了九牛二虎之力，把这个戏搬上了舞台。尽管他们勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，在《戏剧报》上写文章肉麻地吹捧，广大工农兵还是反对它。一位战斗英雄看了以后说：“这个戏里一个好人都没有，搞阶级调和”。《戏剧报》也收到了许多批评文章，但是他们却扣压起来不给发表。正当这些反革命修正主义分子诚惶诚恐的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派来看戏了。他看完这个美化资产阶级的戏后，赞口不绝，连声说：“深刻！很深刻！非常深刻！”这九个字的评价，和他说过的这些话：“你们报纸只说工人如何好，一点坏处都没有？资本家如何坏，一点好处都没有？”“资本家的知识比我们多，比工人知道得多”，“要向他们学习”，要与资本家“合作”，要“团结”，是多么一致呀！党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为这个戏这么一打气，就把资本主义、现代修正主义和三十年代剧目在全国泛滥的闸门打开了，于是大量毒草上市，社会主义的舞台被“死人”“洋人”统治了。
    十几年来，北京人艺所上演的许多剧目，都是紧密配合反革命逆流的。在反右派斗争中，正当文联机关斗争右派分子吴祖光的时候，近在咫尺的首都剧场竟在演他的为蒋家王朝招魂的《风雪夜归人》；为了抵制学雷锋和全国人民大学解放军，一九六三年上演了丑化八路军的大毒草《李国瑞》；为了与《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》相配合，一九六三年，又第二次重排了反革命修正主义分子田汉的反党反社会主义的《关汉卿》……。
    对抗毛主席批示，打着“红旗”反红旗
    一九六二年九月，伟大的领袖毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，提出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争问题。他教导我们：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    一九六三年，毛主席又进一步地向文艺界指出：各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。
    毛主席的英明指示，一针见血地击中了反革命修正主义文艺路线的总后台的要害。他顿时慌了手脚，急急忙忙在一九六四年一月三日，召开了一次文艺座谈会。他在会上说，文艺界的反革命修正主义路线，不过是个“组织问题”，起因于认识上的“不清楚”和工作上的“抓不紧”，今后只要大力“扶植”“肯定”新东西，就可以解决了。他闭口不谈对毒草的批判和反击，却大谈所谓“立”，把创作问题当成了主要问题。这是别有用心的大阴谋。
    文艺座谈会开过以后不几天，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派还跟一个作家谈了许多关于如何“立”的问题。他既不谈深入工农兵，也不谈思想改造，单单指责文艺工作者怕犯错误，不敢写现实的阶级斗争，不敢写错误的现象。什么“不敢写现实斗争”，“不敢写错误的现象”，这明明是煽动一些人起来放手去攻击党，攻击社会主义！
    总后台发了黑指示，北京人艺旧党委立即照办。一九六四年演出的工业戏《矿山兄弟》，就是本着他的
  “敢写现实斗争”、“敢写错误的现象”的黑指示搞出来的。在这出戏里，大跃进被描绘成只顾数量，不管质量，违背客观规律的蛮干，这与党内头号走资本主义道路当权派恶毒攻击三面红旗，诬蔑大跃进是“发疯”，是“跃退”，三面红旗可以让人家“怀疑几年”等等黑话同出一辙。
    有人说这帮资产阶级老爷们，在一九六四年以后，为了应付局面“收”了。不对，他们根本没有收，而是以攻为守，打着现代戏的旗号，大搞资产阶级的颠覆活动。我们剧院演出的现代戏，就充当了反革命修正主义集团在文化思想战线上向无产阶级进攻的“敢死队”，直接为他们反革命复辟的罪恶目的服务。
            两本《修养》的毒害
    十几年来，在毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想的照耀下，我院革命群众不只一次地向反革命修正主义文艺路线进行过针锋相对的斗争。几乎每年年终总结时，都有人提出剧院是否执行了毛主席的文艺路线这样一个严肃的问题。一九五四年，在《红楼梦研究》批判运动中，革命群众，特别是青年同志，就曾向吹捧资产阶级“权威”，压制新生力量的旧党委开过火，但是遭到了旧北京市委的反革命修正主义分子疯狂镇压。他们给响应毛主席号召起来造反的青年团员们扣上了“与党争夺领导权”“反党”的大帽子。
    为了培养一批真正听人摆布的活机器，他们搬出党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》来腐蚀人，宣扬什么“所有一切附有条件的服从，都是不对的，应该是无条件的绝对的服从”，叫人做他们的“驯服工具”。这本《修养》和这套反革命修正主义“组织原则”，长期以来成了我院反革命修正主义分子的护身符，只要你提一点尖锐的意见，稍稍碰一碰这条黑线，他们马上就把你组织起来学《修养》，写检查，美其名为“整顿”思想。
    我院旧党委是很懂得反革命的两手策略的，在使用“大棒”的同时，也使用了“胡萝卜”政策。在一九五六年制定的院“十二年规划”中，又以全国第一流导演、第一流演员、第一流舞台美术设计、第一流技师等等为诱饵，使得不少同志走上了白专道路。一些演员左手拿着党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》，右手拿着史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的《演员自我修养》。“两本《修养》一肩挑，三名三高是目标”，一个是政治上的鸦片，一个是艺术上的鸦片，它们每时每刻都在毒害着人；一个是“发展个性”，一个是“自我出发”，使许多人的资产阶级世界观根本无法得到改造，甚至使一些人走上了罪恶的道路。北京人艺旧党委就是靠这两本《修养》来为他们的资本主义复辟服务的。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。经过十个月的奋战，全国广大革命群众同心协力，终于把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席革命路线的胜利！
    我们决心和无产阶级革命派战友们、革命的同志们联合起来，共同战斗，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底挖掉反革命修正主义文艺路线！
    让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在我国新生的红彤彤的无产阶级革命文艺的阵地上永远永远地飘扬！
