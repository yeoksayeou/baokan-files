The Soviet revisionist leadership is vigorously promoting a "new system" in Soviet industrial enterprises, which treats the capitalist principle of profit as the driving force behind all economic activities, using it to control production, exchange, and distribution. This retrograde move has made capitalist forces in the Soviet Union even more rampant, causing Soviet industrial enterprises to completely degenerate. The Soviet revisionist leadership claims that "profit is now the primary indicator." They advocate chasing profits as the fundamental motive for stimulating and regulating production. In September 1965, at a plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Kosygin proposed that profit should be used as the "best way to guide enterprises to improve production efficiency" and as the standard for evaluating an enterprise's "contributions."

	Following the principle of profit-first,
	Based on this guiding principle of prioritizing profits, the Soviet revisionist leadership decided to abolish a series of important indicators originally issued by the state, in order to allow enterprises under the "new system" to freely chase high profits without restraint. Now, the Soviet state only sets targets for enterprises on how much to sell (i.e., sales revenue), how much to earn (i.e., profit and profit margin), and how much to remit. As for what to produce (with a few extremely important products temporarily exempted), how much to produce, production costs, and labor productivity, these are all determined by the enterprises themselves according to the profit principle.

	At the same time, the "new system" grants enterprise leaders greater and more extensive privileges. Under the condition of completing the remittance of profits, they almost have the power to independently handle all production, financial, and personnel issues of the enterprise. According to the "Regulations on Socialist State-Owned Production Enterprises" of the Soviet Union, enterprises have the right to "possess, use, and dispose of" all property within the enterprise; the right to sell "excess" equipment, transportation tools, raw materials, materials, and fuel; the right to lease "temporarily unused" workshops, warehouses, equipment, and transportation tools; the right to independently write off "obsolete" fixed assets; the right to use "their own funds" for "extra-plan" construction and use "their own materials" to accept "extra-plan" orders. This "regulation" explicitly states that enterprise leaders can "act on behalf of the enterprise without authorization," they have the power to determine and change the wage grades and bonuses of workers, and the power to independently recruit, dismiss, and punish workers. They can also independently approve the structure and staffing of the enterprise. Thus, "planned economy" has become an empty phrase.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership also uses state "loans" to encourage the implementation of the profit principle. In September 1965, the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to replace state allocations to enterprises with bank loans. According to the principles introduced by the First Deputy Chairman of the State Bank of the Soviet Union, Vorobyov, in an article, the state will grant "more rights and opportunities to use credit" to enterprises with higher profits under "preferential conditions," while enterprises with "poor performance" will be subjected to "higher" interest rates to exert "influence" on them.

	Advocating Free Competition
	To open up more avenues for enterprises to make money, Soviet revisionist leaders are vigorously promoting free competition according to the laws of the capitalist market economy. They advocate "broadly developing direct links between supply and demand enterprises." According to reports, the Soviet Union has widely implemented production based on orders from commercial departments in the textile, apparel, and footwear sectors of the light industry. In such enterprises, some can directly negotiate the product catalog with the marketing agencies of the foreign trade market, and some can set up their own stores and sell their own products. Many black metal rolling stocks, machinery, building materials, and chemical products in the heavy industry have also changed to the method of "direct links." The Soviet Union has also opened some wholesale stores specializing in the sale of production materials.

	To increase the interest in chasing profits, the Soviet revisionist leadership also decided to use profits as the "source" of material incentives, using the method of "deducting from the obtained profits" to establish each enterprise's own "production development fund," "material reward fund," and "cultural measures and housing construction fund," etc. This is actually using the profit principle to further deepen the extremely irrational distribution relationship and strengthen the exploitation of workers by the privileged class. According to reports in Soviet newspapers, "profit deductions" and various "bonuses" are mostly pocketed by enterprise leaders. While a few rubles are given to workers, it is just a deceptive decoration. Many factory leaders simply do not want even this decoration. According to a report in the Soviet "Labor Newspaper" last December, in many enterprises implementing the "new system," "no funds have been allocated from the material reward fund to reward workers, although there is money for this."

	The Economy Becomes More Chaotic
	Since the Soviet revisionist leadership fully promoted the "new system," the already deteriorating economic situation has become even more chaotic. In the pursuit of high profits, speculation, shoddy work, free competition, harming others for personal gain, and layer upon layer of exploitation and other capitalist activities have emerged one after another. According to reports in Soviet newspapers, "the quality of the fabric received by the Pobluyisky Dzerzhinsky Sewing Factory is extremely poor, with a total of 9,650 meters scrapped in eight months. On September 12 last year, 2,670 meters of fabric were received, of which 1,007 meters were scrapped, accounting for 37.7%." Many housing construction companies in the Soviet Union have just completed buildings, "the ceilings are leaking, the wallpaper is peeling off, the rooms are damp, the doors are crooked, the floors are wobbly, and cracks appear on the walls of the bathroom." A worker named I. Ilyashenko revealed that he bought a pair of sandals made by the Karaganda Shoe Factory for 22 rubles. One day, he wore the new shoes to the city, but before he could walk to his destination, the shoes broke, and he had to return halfway.

	People's Strong Indignation
	The Soviet revisionist leadership's retrograde actions and their evil consequences have aroused strong indignation among the Soviet people. Today is the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. The Soviet revisionist leadership is using the decaying and declining capitalist rubbish as a new treasure for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism, which will inevitably face the resistance of the broad laboring people of the Soviet Union and be crushed by the wheels of history.

    资本主义势力更加猖獗　工业企业完全蜕化变质
    苏修极力推行“新体制”全面复辟资本主义
    据新华社二十四日讯　苏修领导集团正在苏联工业企业中极力推行的“新体制”，是把资本主义的利润原则当作带动一切经济活动的“火车头”，用利润原则来支配生产、交换和分配。这种倒行逆施，使苏联资本主义势力更加猖獗，使苏联的工业企业完全蜕化变质。苏修领导集团宣称，“利润现在是基本指标”。他们并把追逐利润作为刺激和调节生产的基本动力。柯西金一九六五年九月在苏共中央全会上提出，要把利润当作“引导企业提高生产效率的最好办法”，评价企业“贡献”的标准。
    奉行利润挂帅
    根据这种利润挂帅的指导原则，苏修领导集团决定，取消原由国家下达的一系列重要指标，以便实行
  “新体制”的企业不受拘束地追逐高额利润。现在苏联国家只给企业规定，卖多少钱（即产品销售额），赚多少钱（即利润和赢利率），上缴多少钱，至于生产什么（某些极其重要的产品暂时例外）、生产多少、产品成本和劳动生产率等，均由企业按照利润原则自行规定。
    与此同时，“新体制”赋予企业领导人更大和更多的特权，在完成上缴利润的前提下，他们几乎有权独立处理企业的一切生产、财务和人事问题。按照苏联《社会主义国营生产企业条例》规定，企业有权“占有、使用和支配”企业中的一切财产；有权出售“多余的”设备、运输工具、原料、材料和燃料；有权出租“暂时不用的”厂房、仓库、设备和运输工具；有权自行注销“陈旧的”固定资产；有权用“自己的资金”搞“计划外”的基本建设和用“自己的材料”接受“计划外”的订货。这个“条例”明文规定，企业领导人可以“不经委托即以企业名义办事”，他有权确定和改变职工的工资级别和奖金，有权自行招收、解雇和处罚工人，他可以自行批准企业的结构和编制。这样，“计划经济”已变成了一句空话。
    苏修领导集团并用国家“贷款”来鼓励贯彻利润原则。一九六五年九月苏共中央全会决定，用银行的贷款代替国家对企业的拨款。按照苏联国家银行管理委员会第一副主席沃罗比耶夫在一篇文章中所介绍的原则，国家对赢利多的企业，按“优惠条件”给予“更大的权利和可能性使用信贷”，对“工作差”的企业，将用“更高”的利息，对之施加“影响”。
    鼓吹自由竞争
    为了给企业开辟更多的赚钱门路，苏修领导人大肆鼓吹按照资本主义市场经济的法则，进行自由竞争。提倡“广泛地发展供求企业之间的直接联系”。据报道，苏联在纺织品、服装和制鞋等轻工业部门中，广泛实行按商业部门的订货生产。在这类企业中，有的可以同外贸市场的推销机构直接商定产品的货目表，有的可以自设商店，自产自销。许多黑色金属轧材、机器、建筑材料和化工产品等重工业产品，已经改按“直接联系”办法提供。苏联并开设了一些专门出售生产资料的批发商店。
    为了增加追逐利润的兴趣，苏修领导集团还决定，把利润作为进行物质刺激的“源泉”，用“从所得利润提成”的办法，建立每个企业自己的“生产发展基金”、“物质奖励基金”及“文化措施和住宅建设基金”等等。这实际上是利用利润原则，来进一步加深极端不合理的分配关系，增强特权阶层对工人的剥削。据苏联报刊报道，“利润提成”和五花八门的“奖金”，绝大部分装进了企业领导人的腰包。而分给工人几个卢布，只不过是骗人的一种点缀。许多工厂企业的领导人干脆连这点点缀也不要了。据苏联《劳动报》去年十二月报道，在实行“新体制”的“许多企业里，还没有从物质奖励基金中拨出资金来奖励工人，虽然说，这方面的钱是有的。”
    经济更加混乱
    苏修领导集团全面推行“新体制”以来，使日益恶化的经济情况更加混乱，为追逐高额利润而投机倒把、偷工减料、自由竞争、损人利己和层层剥削等资本主义活动层出不穷。据苏联报刊透露，“波布卢伊斯克的捷尔任斯基缝纫厂收到的布匹的质量极差，在八个月中共报废九千六百五十多米。去年九月十二日收到的两千六百七十米布匹，其中就报废一千零七米，占百分之三十七点七。”苏联许多房屋建筑公司刚刚建成的房屋，“天花板就漏了，裱糊纸剥落了，房屋里潮湿得可怕，门歪了，地板摇摇晃晃，盥洗室板壁上出现了裂缝”。有一个名叫伊·伊利亚申科的工人揭露说，他用二十二个卢布买了一双卡拉干达制鞋厂做的凉鞋。一天他穿上新鞋到城里去，但是还没有走到，鞋就坏了，只好半路折回来。
    人民强烈愤慨
    苏修领导集团这些倒行逆施及其罪恶后果，引起了苏联人民的强烈愤慨。今天的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。苏修领导集团把腐朽没落的资本主义破烂货当作全面复辟资本主义的新法宝，必将遭到苏联广大劳动人民的反抗，而被历史的车轮压得粉碎。
