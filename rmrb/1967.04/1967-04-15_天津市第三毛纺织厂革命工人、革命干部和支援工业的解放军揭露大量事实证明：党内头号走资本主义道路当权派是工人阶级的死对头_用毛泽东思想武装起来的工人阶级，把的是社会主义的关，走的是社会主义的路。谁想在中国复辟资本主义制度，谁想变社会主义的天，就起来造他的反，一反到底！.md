The revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and supporting military personnel of Tianjin's Third Textile Mill have revealed that the top capitalist-roader in the Party is the enemy of the working class. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the working class guards the gates of socialism and walks the path of socialism. Anyone who wants to restore capitalism in China, who wants to change the socialist sky, should rise up and rebel against them, and rebel to the end!

New China News Agency, Tianjin, April 14th - At the time when the billion people are launching a total offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and supporting military personnel of Tianjin's Third Textile Mill, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have used their personal experiences and a wealth of facts to expose the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader in the Party since he came to the predecessor of this mill, the Dongya Textile Mill, in 1949, where he vigorously advocated for the capitalist road. They angrily pointed out that this Chinese Khrushchev loves the bourgeoisie and hates the proletariat; promotes capitalism and opposes socialism; relies on capitalists and suppresses workers; advocates for "exploitation is meritorious" and "rebellion is unjust," and opposes "exploitation is sinful" and "rebellion is just." He is not a "revolutionary," but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary. We must raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash him to the ground!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party loves the bourgeoisie and hates the proletariat

Fifteen-year-old former child laborer for the capitalists, old worker Zhou Wenyu, angrily said at a meeting: "Just thinking about the top capitalist-roader in the Party coming to our mill, standing with the capitalists, breathing the same air as the capitalists, and opposing us workers, my lungs are about to burst with anger!"

In April 1949, shortly after Tianjin's liberation, class struggle was fierce. The reactionary capitalist Song Qiying of our mill tried to stop production and sabotage, suppressing the workers' movement. Under the leadership of the military representatives stationed in the mill, we workers exposed this plot and fought back. We insisted on production, opposed the shutdown, and firmly demanded the abolition of all old rules that oppressed workers. At this time, the self-proclaimed "number one or number two figure in China," the top capitalist-roader in the Party, came to our mill for an "inspection." We originally thought he would support our just struggle, but we never imagined that as soon as he entered the mill gate, he would sneak into the dark room of the big capitalist to have a secret talk. Only after talking enough and feeling satisfied, did he, accompanied by the big capitalist, arrogantly receive the worker representatives and military representatives. What was even more infuriating was that when the military representative exposed the capitalist's sabotage of production, ruthless exploitation of workers, and vicious suppression of the workers' movement, this self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" saw that the capitalist was not happy, and actually scolded the military representative on behalf of the capitalist. This self-proclaimed "leader of the proletariat" also shamelessly flattered the capitalist, saying: "You are the one who feeds the workers. The more factories you build, the more workers you exploit, the better." How could this be the words of a Communist Party member! This is purely the tone of a spokesperson for the bourgeoisie! Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor hate without reason." Why does the top capitalist-roader in the Party love the bourgeoisie so much? Why does he serve the bourgeoisie so diligently? But towards the working class and socialism, he is so extremely hostile? The bottom line is: he is not a "revolutionary" at all, but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary! His soul is the ugly soul of the bourgeoisie.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party promotes capitalism and opposes socialism

Old worker and foreman of the wool spinning workshop, Zhao Jiting, said: "Comrade Zhu De's article speaks for the hearts of us old workers. The top capitalist-roader in the Party indeed 'thinks of capitalism, loves capitalism, and talks about capitalism.' He wants to make our country walk the dark road of capitalism."

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "After the revolution's victory, ... we must build China into a great socialist country." "If we think that we do not need to limit capitalism now, if we think that we can abandon the slogan of 'regulating capital,' this is completely wrong, this is the viewpoint of right-opportunism." However, the Chinese Khrushchev blatantly defied Chairman Mao's instructions. He came to our mill and became close with the big capitalist Song Qiying, dreaming a dream and singing the same tune, wanting to develop capitalism. Before liberation, Song Qiying wrote an article titled "My Dream," saying that he wanted to develop his factory, which employed a thousand or so people, into ten large-scale enterprises employing tens of thousands of workers, and also build a "Song Family City" in the western suburbs of Tianjin, locking workers in there generation after generation to be his cattle and horses, to be exploited by him.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party discovered that Song Qiying and himself were "dream brothers," so he praised him highly, urging him to expand production and set up new factories. He also said that during the socialist period, the state would hand over sixteen factories to him to manage and give him a pay raise. Song Qiying was overjoyed and said: "My dream of developing enterprises, which I have dreamed for so many years, is finally going to be realized." A few days later, he sent a letter to the top capitalist-roader in the Party, saying that he wanted to expand production and set up new factories. The top capitalist-roader in the Party was very pleased to see this and replied, "I am very pleased." Look! The "socialism" spoken by the top capitalist-roader in the Party is so consistent with the big capitalist's "dream," and his "pleasure" is so in tune with the capitalist's arrogant attack!

We warn the top capitalist-roader in the Party: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." Your "beautiful dream" of walking the capitalist road will never be realized. Take your "beautiful dream" and go to hell!

Female worker Li Yujin of the Angora Wool Workshop said: "We workers want to eliminate capitalism. The top capitalist-roader in the Party says that the more factories capitalists run, the better, encouraging capitalists to develop capitalism. He is the enemy of our working class."

In the old society, we suffered from the exploitation and oppression of capitalists, with nothing to eat or wear, and no political rights or living guarantees. Capitalists did not allow us female workers to get married. When I entered the factory, I was already married, but I was afraid they would not hire me, so I had to say I was not married. Later, when I became pregnant, the capitalist said I lied, violated the factory rules, and kicked me out. At that time, my husband was also unemployed at home, and we could not even eat one meal a day. Life was really unbearable. On the third day after giving birth, I had to come to the factory to ask for work, but the capitalist did not allow it. There was no way, so I had to say the child died. They saw that I was a good worker, so they let me work. After starting work, the child at home had no milk to drink, and was fed only with rice water, starving to the point of being skin and bones. At that time, the suffering of our workers was truly indescribable. Capitalism is a system that eats people. Yet, the top capitalist-roader in the Party wants our country to walk the capitalist road, allowing capitalists to forever ride on our heads, making us suffer from exploitation and oppression generation after generation. His heart is more poisonous than a snake!

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we fought a resolute struggle against the capitalists, carried out socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises, and our workers' lives are getting better day by day. In the past, one person working could not feed one mouth, but now the whole family of seven or eight people live very well. My eldest child, who was said to have "died," was thin and weak in the old society, but in the socialist system, he grew up to be a strong young man and joined the People's Liberation Army. The second child went to university. Several younger ones also went to middle school and elementary school. Socialism is good! Socialism is the lifeblood of our working class!

We workers will resolutely follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist road. Our descendants will forever follow Chairman Mao and make revolution. The top capitalist-roader in the Party opposes socialism, opposes Chairman Mao, and wants to walk the capitalist road. He is the enemy of our working class, and we will fight him to the end.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party relies on capitalists and suppresses the working class

Old worker and Communist Party member Qiu Lianji of the combing workshop said: "Our most red sun, Chairman Mao, clearly pointed out the issue of relying on whom in urban struggles and industrial development as early as March 1949: 'We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class.' However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party dared to defy Chairman Mao, saying: 'The working class may not be reliable at certain times, ... do not think that relying on the working class is problem-free.' He also said that we should 'especially rely on managers, engineers, and technicians,' and that 'capitalists also serve the people.' This is all nonsense! When have capitalists served the people? They only know how to suck the blood of workers and peel the skin of workers.

I came to Dongya Textile Mill in the winter of 1934. At that time, the mill had only two broken spinning machines and a few wooden dyeing vats, and could only spin wool yarn, not even qualifying as a workshop. Before liberation, Song Qiying made a fortune by squeezing the blood and sweat of workers, establishing three workshops that could spin wool yarn and weave sackcloth. Is this the 'merit' of the capitalist? Absolutely not. Capitalists know nothing. Take Song Qiying as an example. He knows nothing about machines, has never touched a single piece of wool. All these machines were created by the blood, sweat, and lives of us poor brothers! They were created by the hands of workers.

It is despicable that the top capitalist-roader in the Party has no workers in his eyes. He vigorously praises the bourgeoisie, saying nonsense like 'in the city, production is key, capitalists know more than we do, they know more than workers, and they occupy a very high position in urban production.' Song Qiying, such a running dog and reactionary capitalist, was praised by him as 'enlightened,' 'progressive,' and 'serving the people.' However, a wolf is a wolf. The wolf nature of this capitalist, Song Qiying, will not change. He blackmailed the state and refused to resume production. We said: 'If the capitalist does not work, we will.' So we pulled people out of the hemp mill and started the wool mill. He was not satisfied with drinking human blood and plotted to betray the country and flee abroad. We fought to the death with him, but the top capitalist-roader in the Party protected him, allowing him to deceive the state into giving him a large amount of loans and foreign exchange to flee abroad. Look! This is the capitalist that the top capitalist-roader in the Party expects to undertake the 'great cause of nation-building.'

After the capitalist left, did the factory close down? No. On the contrary, under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, we workers have made this factory better and better. Now our mill has achieved mechanized operation, increased product varieties, and doubled production. The facts prove that once we workers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we become the smartest and most wise. We workers rely on Mao Zedong Thought to run socialist factories and enterprises, and only by relying on the working class can we build the socialist cause well. The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates relying on capitalists, which is to let capitalists ride on our heads again, act arrogantly, and we will never agree. "Ask the vast land, who controls the rise and fall?" We, we, we! We are the masters of the factory, we are the masters of the country, we are the masters of the world.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates "exploitation is meritorious" and opposes "exploitation is sinful"

Soldier Zhou Yuzin said: "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In a class struggle society, if there is freedom for the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, there is no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited.' However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, ignoring historical facts, slanders the laboring people, does not admit to class struggle, and openly defies Chairman Mao, saying nonsense like 'laboring people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome exploitation.' Is this true? No, it is completely not true.

I was a worker at Tianjin's Third Textile Mill before joining the army, and my father was also a worker here before liberation. We two generations of workers know what exploitation is and what revolution is. In the old society, my father worked more than ten hours a day and still could not feed the family. Capitalists only know how to exploit and do not treat workers as human beings, saying nonsense like 'three-legged toads are hard to find, but two-legged people are everywhere.' After liberation, the working class took power, and our family's life is getting better and better. Several brothers have all gone to school. Regarding capitalists exploiting workers, we have the most to say. Before liberation, the workers of old 'Dongya' under the Party's leadership fought against capitalists and went on strike more than once to oppose exploitation. In 1946, workers went on a big strike to oppose the ruthless exploitation of capitalists. Capitalists colluded with the Kuomintang, bringing in heavy troops to suppress, but workers persisted in the struggle and finally won the victory. This does not show that where there is exploitation and oppression, there is resistance and struggle? If workers 'welcome exploitation,' how do you explain workers going on strike? This top capitalist-roader in the Party is completely speaking for capitalists, making us become cows and horses to be exploited again, and we will never agree.

I am a worker's son and a revolutionary soldier. I will always remember the bitterness of class struggle and never forget the blood debt. I will firmly hold my gun, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and smash the top capitalist-roader in the Party to the ground!

Young mechanic Zhao Changfa of the mobile workshop said: "The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates 'exploitation is not a sin' and 'exploitation is meritorious,' which is completely the tone of capitalists and completely anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. More than a hundred years ago, Marx pointed out: 'Capital comes into the world, from head to toe, every pore oozes blood and filth.' The capitalist's paradise is built on the white bones of workers. Without sucking the blood of workers, capitalists cannot live for a single day. We say: it is not that exploitation is meritorious, but that exploitation is sinful, deserving death!"

Take my family as an example. My father became an apprentice at the age of fifteen. During the First World War, he went overseas to be a "coolie," suffering from the ruthless exploitation of foreign capitalists. Later, he miraculously survived and returned to the motherland. My brother was taken by the Japanese devils to be a "laborer" during the Anti-Japanese War and died in Northeast China. The top capitalist-roader in the Party says: 'If there are more capitalists and more exploitation, then we will feel more comfortable.' My two generations of family not only suffered from the exploitation of Chinese capitalists but also from the exploitation of foreign capitalists. We have suffered enough exploitation, but we have never felt 'more comfortable.' Those who feel 'more comfortable' are not workers, but capitalists. The blood and sweat of workers feed their big bellies, and they become 'millionaires.' What we workers gain is the pain of family separation, family destruction, and having no clothes or food, leaving behind a deep hatred of class struggle. This is not just the suffering and hatred of our family, but the suffering and hatred of the entire class. The root of suffering is only one, the evil capitalist exploitation system, and the blood-sucking bourgeoisie.

We workers have always hated exploitation. To build a communist society without exploitation and class, we must fight generation after generation until the great communism is realized! Whoever wants to restore capitalism in China, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never agree!

Old worker Tian Weifang of the mobile workshop said: "When Tianjin was just liberated, workers said: 'Chairman Mao's sunshine shines on the 'Dongya' mill, and now we can stand up and be masters!' But the top capitalist-roader in the Party not only did not support us workers but also told us not to 'make trouble' and to listen to the company and believe the manager Song. This black talk gave the capitalists courage, and on the day after the top capitalist-roader in the Party left, the capitalist held a meeting saying: 'My exploitation is reasonable and glorious, and workers making trouble is wrong.'

In the difficult days of struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao gave us support. We 'Dongya' workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of 'rebellion is just,' 'decided to fight to the end, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory,' fought back against the capitalists, and smashed the shackles of 'factory rules' and 'factory regulations' around our necks! The top capitalist-roader in the Party lies with his eyes open, slandering our workers' revolutionary actions as 'making trouble.' 'Making trouble'? We are exactly going to 'make trouble'! We workers are born to 'make trouble' with capitalists! We are going to make the capitalist's order chaotic, and 'make' the top capitalist-roader in the Party fall, 'make' him stink, and 'make' him fall from power! Let our socialist China never take a step back, let us workers who stand up and take power never be cows and horses for capitalists again, let our proletarian dictatorship country never change color!

Technician Yang Xiuchun of the spinning workshop said: "We have suffered a lot from the top capitalist-roader in the Party. In 1949, he came to our mill and, together with the capitalists, suppressed workers. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small group of capitalist-roaders in the mill and ghosts and monsters came out again, waving the 'stick' of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, stirring up the black wind left by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, creating white terror, and attacking workers. In less than a week, more than four hundred workers (almost a quarter of the entire mill) were labeled as 'ghosts and monsters'! We workers say: capitalist-roaders, you beat us, beat us into whatever 'gods' you want! You have the top capitalist-roader in the Party to support you, and we have our most red sun, Chairman Mao, to support us! You want to overturn our socialist sky, want to continue the bourgeois dictatorship over us workers, that is a daytime dream! We have Chairman Mao's teaching of 'rebellion is just,' we will 'rebel' against you, and we will definitely 'rebel'! 'Rebellion is just' is the truth that our proletariat has gained from struggle, is the fundamental truth of Marxism, is Chairman Mao's great call to overthrow the life of capitalism! Rebellion is just, rebelling against the top capitalist-roader in the Party is just! We workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the brightest eyes. The tricks of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, we see through them with one glance. More than ten years ago, he did not deceive us, and today he will not deceive us. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of 'carrying the revolution through to the end,' we will carry forward the spirit of daring to struggle and thorough revolution, and we will definitely fight to the end against a small group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, and rebel to the end! Dig up their roots, pull down their biggest backer, smash them, expose them, and make them stink! 'The golden monkey raises the thousand-jin hammer, the jade sky is clear of dust for ten thousand miles.' We workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought guard the gates of socialism. Whoever wants to walk the capitalist road, whoever wants to change the socialist sky, we will smash them with one hammer, break their spines, and make them never rise again!"

Military cadre Ren Mingde said: "I listened to the workers' comrades expose the top capitalist-roader in the Party's advocacy of 'exploitation is meritorious' and 'rebellion is unjust' in the Third Textile Mill, and I was extremely angry! What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what kind of class speaks what kind of words. In 1949, the top capitalist-roader in the Party sang praises for the capitalist exploitation system that eats people in the Third Textile Mill, fully exposing his filthy and ugly bourgeois true colors. He is a genuine Chinese Khrushchev.

We, the People's Liberation Army, have very high prestige among the people because we propagate Mao Zedong Thought and execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao has the clearest banner and the most steadfast position. In the early days of liberation, the military representatives stationed in the mill firmly stood on the side of the workers and fought against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the blood-sucking Song Qiying. This rebellion is good and correct. Today, at the critical moment when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite and seize power from a small group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, we have come to the factory again. Before entering the factory, I set myself two tasks: one is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat; the second is to learn from revolutionary workers, especially to learn their revolutionary spirit.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party wants to restore capitalism in China, which is a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible! Socialist society is an iron mountain, with the great leader Chairman Mao guiding the direction, and the broad revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers holding and protecting power. Whoever dares to touch a single hair of the socialist mountain, we will smash them to pieces!"

    天津市第三毛纺织厂革命工人、革命干部和支援工业的解放军揭露大量事实证明：
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是工人阶级的死对头
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，把的是社会主义的关，走的是社会主义的路。谁想在中国复辟资本主义制度，谁想变社会主义的天，就起来造他的反，一反到底！
    新华社天津十四日电　在亿万人民向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的时候，天津市第三毛纺织厂的革命工人、革命干部和支援工业的解放军干部战士一起，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，用亲身经历的大量事实，狠揭党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一九四九年来到这个厂的前身——东亚毛纺织厂，大肆鼓吹资本主义道路的滔天罪行。他们愤怒地指出，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫爱的是资产阶级，恨的是无产阶级；兴的是资本主义，反的是社会主义；依靠的是资本家，打击的是工人；鼓吹的是“剥削有功”、“造反无理”，反对的是“剥削有罪”、“造反有理”。他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命、反革命。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把他批倒批臭。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派爱的是资产阶级，恨的是无产阶级
    十五岁就给资本家当童工的老工人翟文玉在座谈会上愤怒地说：一想起党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派来我们厂，与资本家站在一起，同资本家一个鼻孔出气，反对我们工人，我的肺都气炸了！
    一九四九年四月，天津刚刚解放，阶级斗争十分激烈。我们厂的反动资本家宋棐卿，企图停工破坏生产，压制工人运动。我们工人在驻厂解放军代表的领导下，识破了这个阴谋，针锋相对地展开斗争。我们坚持生产，反对停工，坚决要求取消资本家压迫工人的一切旧规章。就在这个时候，自吹为“在中国不是数一就是数二”的“大人物”、党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，来我厂“视察”了。我们原以为他一定会支持我们的正义斗争，万万想不到他一进厂门，就钻到大资本家的黑屋里去密谈。直到谈够了、亲足了，他才由大资本家陪着，傲慢地接见了工人代表和军代表。更使人愤恨的是，当军代表揭露资本家破坏生产，残酷剥削工人，阴险毒辣地镇压工人运动的罪恶时，这个自称“老革命”的人，一看资本家很不高兴，竟替资本家训斥军代表。这个自称“无产阶级领袖”的人，还厚颜无耻地向资本家拍马屁说：你是养工人的，你盖的工厂越多，剥削的工人越多，就越好。这哪里象一个共产党员说的话！这纯粹是地地道道的资产阶级代言人的腔调！毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”为什么党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派对资产阶级这样热爱？为资产阶级服务这样卖力？而对工人阶级，对社会主义，却这样极端仇视？归根结蒂就是一句话：他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命、反革命！他的灵魂，是资产阶级的丑恶灵魂。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派兴的是资本主义，反的是社会主义
    老工人、毛纺车间丙班班长赵继亭说：戚本禹同志的文章，说出了我们老工人的心里话。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，确实“想的是资本主义，爱的是资本主义，讲的还是资本主义”。他就是想使我们国家走上资本主义的黑路。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上教导我们：“在革命胜利以后，……把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。”“如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。”可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟明目张胆地抗拒毛主席的指示，他来我们厂与大资本家宋棐卿打得火热，做一个样子的梦，说一个调子的话，要发展资本主义。解放前，宋棐卿写过一篇文章，叫《我的梦》，说要把他一个雇用千把人的厂子，“发展”成为雇用数万工人的十个大型企业，还要在天津西郊造一座“宋家城”，把工人世世代代关在里面当他的牛马，受他的剥削。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派发现宋棐卿和自己是同“梦”兄弟，就大加夸奖，要他多多办厂。还说到社会主义的时候，国家要把十六个厂交给他办，还要给他增薪。宋棐卿事后得意忘形地说：“我发展企业的理想象个梦，一直梦了这么多年，今天才真要实现了。”过了没几天，他就给党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派去信，说要扩大生产，增设新厂。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，一看十分高兴，回信说“甚为欣慰”。看！党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所说的“社会主义”，与大资本家的“梦”是多么的一致，他的“欣慰”与资本家的猖狂进攻又是多么的合拍！
    我们要警告党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”你们走资本主义道路的“美梦”，是永远也实现不了的，带着你们的“美梦”见鬼去吧！
    山羊绒车间女工李玉琴说：我们工人阶级就是要消灭资本主义。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，说资本家办的工厂越多越好，鼓励资本家发展资本主义。他是我们工人阶级的死对头。
    在旧社会，我们受资本家的剥削压迫，没吃没穿，一点政治权利和生活保障也没有。资本家不准我们女工结婚，我进厂时已经结了婚，怕他们不要，只好说没有结婚。后来怀孕了，资本家说我说假话，违犯厂规，把我一脚踢开。当时我爱人也失业在家，一天一顿饭也吃不上。日子实在过不下去，生了孩子的第三天，我就来厂要求上工，资本家不准，没办法，只好说孩子死了。他们见我是个好劳力，让我上了工。上工后，孩子放在家里没奶吃，全用米汤喂，饿得一身皮包骨头。那时我们工人受的苦，真是说不尽诉不完。资本主义制度是吃人的制度。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却要我们国家走资本主义道路，让资本家永远骑在我们工人头上，叫我们世世代代受剥削受压迫。他的心比毒蛇还毒！
    在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，我们和资本家进行了坚决的斗争，对资本主义企业进行了社会主义改造，我们工人的生活一天好似一天。过去一人做工养不了一口，现在全家七八口都过得很好。我那个被说成“死了”的大孩子，在旧社会又瘦又弱，可是在社会主义制度下，长成一个棒小子，参加了解放军。第二个孩子上了大学。几个小的也上了中学、小学。社会主义就是好！社会主义是我们工人阶级的命根子！
    我们工人阶级坚决跟着毛主席走社会主义道路，我们的子子孙孙也永远跟着毛主席干革命。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，反对社会主义，反对毛主席，想走资本主义道路，他是我们工人阶级的敌人，我们坚决和他拚到底。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派依靠的是资本家，打击的是工人阶级
    精梳车间挡车老工人、共产党员邱连级说：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，对城市斗争和发展工业依靠谁的问题，在一九四九年三月就英明地指出：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派竟胆敢对抗毛主席，胡说什么：“工人阶级在一定的时候也可能是不能依靠的，……不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的。”还说什么要“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”，“资本家也是为人民服务的”。这完全是胡说八道！资本家什么时候为人民服务过？他只知道喝工人的血，剥工人的皮。
    我是一九三四年冬天来到东亚毛纺织厂的。当时，厂里只有两台破纺车和几个木头染槽，只能纺毛线，根本算不上什么车间。解放前，宋棐卿靠榨取工人血汗发了财，建立了三个车间，能够纺毛线、织麻袋。难道这是资本家的“功劳”吗？根本不是。资本家什么都不懂。就拿宋棐卿来说，对于机器，他一窍不通，一门不摸，根本没有沾过一根羊毛。这些机器全是我们穷哥们用血汗、生命换来的！是我们工人的双手创造出来的。
    可恨的是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，眼里根本没有我们工人。他极力吹捧资产阶级，胡说什么“城市讲生产，资本家知识比我们多，比工人知道得多，在城市生产上他们占很高的地位。”宋棐卿这样的洋奴、反动资本家，竟被他吹捧成“开明的”、“进步的”、“为人民服务的”。但是狼总是狼，宋棐卿这个资本家的狼性是不会改变的，他要挟国家，拒不开工生产。我们说：“资本家不干我们干。”于是我们从麻厂抽出人来，把毛厂办起来。他喝人血不够胃口，就阴谋叛国投敌，我们和他拚死地斗争，可是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派却包庇他，让他骗取国家大批贷款和外汇外逃。看！这就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所期待胜任“建国大业”的资本家。
    资本家走后，工厂倒闭没有？没有。相反，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，我们工人把这个工厂办得越来越好啦。现在我厂实现了机械化操作，产品品种增加，产量成倍提高。事实证明，我们工人一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最有智慧，我们工人阶级就是靠毛泽东思想办社会主义的工厂企业，也只有依靠我们工人阶级才能把社会主义事业建设好。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，鼓吹依靠资本家，就是让资本家重新骑在我们头上，作威作福，我们绝不答应。“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们，我们，我们！我们就是工厂的主人，我们就是国家的主人，我们就是世界的主人。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“剥削有功”，反对“剥削有罪”
    解放军战士周酉津说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。”但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，不顾历史事实，诬蔑劳动人民，不承认阶级斗争，公开对抗毛主席，胡说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”。果真是这样吗？不，完全不是。
    我入伍前就在天津市第三毛纺织厂当工人，我父亲解放前也在这个工厂当工人，我们两代工人懂得什么叫剥削，什么叫革命。旧社会，我父亲一天劳动十小时以上，还养活不了一家人。资本家只知道剥削，根本不把工人当人看，胡说什么“三条腿的蛤蟆难找，两条腿的人有的是”。解放后，工人阶级当家作主了，我们一家人生活越过越好，兄弟几人都上了学。关于资本家剥削工人，我们最有发言权。解放前，老“东亚”的工人就在党的领导下，同资本家作斗争，为反对剥削，不只一次地举行过罢工。一九四六年，工人们为了反对资本家的残酷剥削，举行大罢工，资本家勾结国民党，调来重兵镇压，工人们坚持斗争，最后终于取得了胜利。这不正说明哪里有剥削有压迫，哪里就有反抗就有斗争吗？如果说工人是“欢迎剥削”，工人罢工又如何解释呢？这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，完全是替资本家说话，让我们再去当牛做马受剥削，我们坚决不答应。
    我是工人的儿子，是革命战士，一定牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，紧握手中枪，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批倒批臭！
    机动车间青年钳工赵长发说：党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派鼓吹什么“剥削无罪”“剥削有功”，完全是资本家的腔调，完全是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大黑话。一百多年前，马克思指出：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”资本家的天堂是建立在工人的白骨之上，不吸工人的血，资本家一天也活不下去。我们说：不是剥削有功，而是剥削有罪，罪该万死！
    就拿我家来说吧，我父亲十几岁就当徒工。在第一次世界大战期间，远渡重洋，去当“华工”，受尽了外国资本家的残酷剥削，后来侥幸落了一条命，回到了祖国。我哥哥在抗日战争时期，被日本鬼子抓去当“劳工”，死在东北。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派说：“如果资本家多了，剥削多了，那么，我们就越感到舒服。”我们一家两代人，不仅受了中国资本家的剥削，还受了外国资本家的剥削，我们是受剥削够多的了，可从来也没有什么“越感到舒服”。越感到舒服的不是工人，而是资本家，工人的血汗喂饱了他们的大肚皮，他们变成了“百万富翁”。我们工人获得的是妻离子散，家破人亡，无衣无食的痛苦，留下的是比山重比海深的阶级仇恨。这不是我们一家的苦，一家的仇，而是整个阶级的苦，阶级的仇。苦根只有一条，就是万恶的资本主义剥削制度，就是吃人喝血的资产阶级。
    我们工人阶级从来就是痛恨剥削的，为了建立一个没有剥削没有阶级的共产主义社会，我们要世世代代战斗下去，直到伟大的共产主义实现！谁想在中国复辟资本主义制度，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级一万个不答应！
    造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反，让毛泽东思想光辉照亮全世界机动车间老工人田维芳说：天津刚解放的时候，工人们说：毛主席的阳光照到“东亚”厂，这下可翻身做主人了！可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派不但不给我们工人撑腰，反而叫我们不要“捣乱”，要听公司的，相信宋经理。这一通黑话给资本家打了气，就在这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派走后的第二天，资本家就开大会说：“我剥削有理，是光荣的，工人捣乱是不对的。”
    在斗争艰苦的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席给我们撑了腰。我们“东亚”工人按照毛主席“造反有理”的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，同资本家针锋相对展开斗争，粉碎了卡住我们脖子的枷锁“厂训”和“厂规”！党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派睁着眼睛说瞎话，把我们工人的革命行动诬蔑为“捣乱”。“捣乱”又怎么样？我们就是要
  “捣乱”！我们工人生来就是跟资本家“捣乱”的！我们就是要把资本家的统治秩序捣得乱乱的，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派“捣”垮、“捣”臭、“捣”下马！让我们社会主义的中国永远不走回头路，让我们站起来当家作主的工人再也不给资本家当牛马，让我们无产阶级专政的国家永远不变颜色！
    纺二车间技术员杨秀琴说：我们受尽了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的害。一九四九年，他到我们厂来，和资本家一道压制工人。这次无产阶级文化大革命中，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神，又一起跑了出来，舞着党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“棍棒”，鼓起党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派遗留下来的黑风，制造白色恐怖，围攻打击工人。在不到一个星期的时间里，就有四百多名工人（几乎占全厂人数的四分之一），被打成“牛鬼蛇神”！我们工人说：走资本主义道路的当权派，你们打吧，把我们打成什么“神”都不怕！你们有党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派撑腰，我们有我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席撑腰！你们想翻我们社会主义的天，想对我们工人继续实行资产阶级专政，那是白日做梦！我们有毛主席“造反有理”的教导，我们“造”你们的“反”造定了！“造反有理”，是我们无产阶级从斗争中得来的真理，是马克思主义的根本道理，是毛主席鼓舞我们革资本主义的命的伟大号召！造反就是有理，造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反就是有理！我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，眼睛最亮，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一套鬼把戏，一眼就看穿了，十几年前他没有骗了我们，今天更骗不过我们。我们遵照毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导，发扬敢于斗争，彻底革命的精神，一定要对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛打猛追，一反到底！挖他们的老根，把他们的最大后台老板拉下马，批垮、批透、批臭！“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，把的是社会主义关口，谁想走资本主义道路，谁想变社会主义的天，我们就一锤头把他打倒！打断他的脊骨，打得他永世爬不起来！
    解放军干部任明德说：我听了工人同志揭露党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在第三毛纺织厂鼓吹什么“剥削有功”、“造反无理”的谬论，气愤极了！什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。一九四九年，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在第三毛纺织厂为人吃人的资本主义剥削制度大唱颂歌，大放厥词，完全暴露了他肮脏丑恶的资产阶级真面目。他是地地道道的中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    我们人民解放军在人民群众中有很高的威信，因为我们宣传的是毛泽东思想，因为我们执行的是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军，旗帜最鲜明，立场最坚定。解放初期，驻厂的军代表坚定地站在工人同志一边，跟党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和吸血鬼宋棐卿进行针锋相对的斗争，这个反造得好，造得对。今天，在无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的关键时刻，我们又来到了工厂。进厂前，我给自己规定了两条任务：一是宣传毛泽东思想，支持无产阶级革命派；二是向革命工人学习，特别要学习他们的革命精神。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，企图在中国复辟资本主义，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！社会主义社会是铁打的江山，有伟大的领袖毛主席指引航向，有广大的革命工农兵掌权、保权，谁胆敢动社会主义江山一根毫毛，我们就打它个稀巴烂！
