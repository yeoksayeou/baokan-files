The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be especially vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and guard against such bad elements seizing the leadership of the Party and the state at various levels."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a struggle to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. It is a great political movement to uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, ensure that our Party will never change its color, and ensure that our country will never change its color. In this movement, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have been exposed, and their chief backer, the Party's top capitalist-roader in power, has been exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

The three articles "Patriotism or Treason?" "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Question Must Be Criticized" and "The 'Strike One, Protect One' Line Is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" published in the *Red Flag* magazine have sounded the battle cry for thoroughly criticizing the Party's top capitalist-roader in power. A nationwide and army-wide mass movement to thoroughly criticize the Party's top capitalist-roader in power is now sweeping the country.

The Party's top capitalist-roader in power obstinately stands on the bourgeois reactionary position, opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. During the democratic revolution, he repeatedly pushed the line of capitulating to the bourgeoisie. Long before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he propagated the philosophy of survival and the philosophy of betrayal, directing some captured "Communist Party members" to surrender to the class enemy. Later, he sheltered them, recruited them, formed cliques, and let them usurp key positions. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he advocated the "new stage of peace and democracy," preparing to kneel and surrender to American imperialism and the Kuomintang. After the liberation of the whole country and the proletariat seized power, he frantically opposed the socialist revolution, advocating the implementation of capitalism. In 1949, he proposed welcoming capitalist exploitation and developing capitalism. In 1950, he called the treacherous film *The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty* "patriotic"; he advocated the vigorous development of "three horses, one plow, one cart-style" rich peasants, opposed mutual-aid teams and cooperatives, opposed the development of collective economy, and shouted "consolidating the new democratic order." In 1951 and 1952, he advocated the development of the rich peasant economy and capitalism, promoting the "four freedoms." Later, he opposed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, opposed agricultural cooperativization, and slashed cooperatives. In 1956, he echoed the international revisionist trend, loudly proclaiming the theory of the extinction of class struggle. In 1962, he spread the wind of individual farming, advocating "three autonomies and one contract," "three harmonies and one less," opposing the general line, opposing the Great Leap Forward, opposing the people's communes, and at the same time, printing a large number of his *On Practice*. In 1964, he pushed the opportunist line of "left" in form and right in essence, sabotaging the socialist education movement. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he, together with another top capitalist-roader in power within the Party, put forward and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. All this fully shows that for a long time, he has opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and he is fundamentally not a Marxist. He is the biggest representative of the bourgeoisie within our Party; he is the Khrushchev sleeping in our midst.

The sharp struggle between the two lines over the past seventeen years is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and revisionist thought, the struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration. Ultimately, it is the struggle over whether China will take the socialist road or the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao teaches us that socialist society is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle; there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism; there exists the danger of capitalist restoration. The overthrown bourgeoisie, though their material possessions have been confiscated, their reactionary ideas cannot be confiscated and will never be confiscated. They are always trying to restore their rule. They use the tactics of "infiltrating from within" and "pulling out from within" to find their representatives within our Party. Some people within the proletariat and its vanguard may also be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and degenerate into new bourgeois elements. In short, as long as there are classes and class struggle in socialist society, there is the possibility of capitalist restoration. As long as there is a bourgeoisie in society, they will infiltrate into the superstructure, infiltrate into the Party and the government, and form a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. This is an objective law of class struggle, which is not strange and is not subject to human will.

The Party's top capitalist-roader in power is the chief backer of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party, and is actually the commander-in-chief of the bourgeoisie's attack on us. If we do not expose him and allow his plot to succeed, our Party and state will change color, there will be a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, and our socialist system will change into a capitalist system like that of the Soviet Union. Then, millions of people will lose their heads, we will suffer twice, take the wrong road, and greatly delay the progress of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Now, we have exposed the Party's top capitalist-roader in power, which is a victory of great historical significance concerning the destiny and future of the Party and the state. However, the Party's top capitalist-roader in power and the class he represents will never resign themselves to their death. To seize back all the positions they have long occupied and to eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Party's top capitalist-roader in power, it is still a serious struggle. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must criticize the Party's top capitalist-roader in power thoroughly and deeply from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects.

We, the People's Liberation Army, are the proletarian revolutionary army created and nurtured by the great leader Chairman Mao, directly led by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, and the main tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The Party's top capitalist-roader in power madly opposes our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposes the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We revolutionary fighters will not agree to this in a thousand ways, in ten thousand ways! We must stand at the forefront of the struggle, together with the broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students, to criticize and attack the Party's top capitalist-roader in power, and resolutely overthrow him!

We must hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, thoroughly expose the heinous crimes of the Party's top capitalist-roader in power, strip off his so-called "old revolutionary" and "consistently correct" mask, thoroughly criticize his bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly criticize his revisionist work *On Practice*, and expose his various fallacies of not wanting revolution, not wanting the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocating bourgeois individualism, and advocating bourgeois idealist philosophy, criticize and denounce them, and expose his reactionary face in broad daylight.

In carrying out the honorable tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, we must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the Party's top capitalist-roader in power and the bourgeois reactionary line he formulated and implemented. Through mass criticism, we must promote the great alliance of the revolutionary masses, implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and carry out the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," smash the various forms of counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, defeat the counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, support the revolutionary masses in seizing power and exercising power, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The whole army must deeply carry out the education on the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line. We must take the criticism of the Party's top capitalist-roader in power as an important part of the education. We must widely collect and expose the specific materials of the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and give them to the cadres and soldiers, so that everyone can understand their reactionary facts, carry out thorough criticism, eliminate their pernicious influence, and raise the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. We must closely combine the mass criticism struggle practice, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, reform our world outlook, further promote the ideological revolutionization of the troops, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

Chairman Mao teaches us that without destruction there can be no construction, without blocking there can be no flow, and without stopping there can be no progress. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. With destruction as the main task, construction is also included. The process of thoroughly criticizing the Party's top capitalist-roader in power is the process of thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establishing Mao Zedong Thought. Through the criticism of the Party's top capitalist-roader in power and through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, deeply permeate the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country, and make Mao Zedong Thought the action guideline for the whole Party, all cadres and soldiers, and the revolutionary people of the whole country. This is the most fundamental guarantee that our Party and our country will never change color.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance victoriously under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    为彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派而战斗
    伟大的统帅毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是把社会主义革命进行到底的斗争，是一个挖掉修正主义根子，防止资本主义复辟，保证我党永不变质，保证我国永不变色的伟大政治运动。在这次运动中，揭出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揭出了他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    《红旗》杂志发表的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》、《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》等三篇文章，吹响了彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的战斗号角。一个彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的群众性运动，正在全国全军广泛深入地展开。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想。在民主革命时期，他一再推行投降资产阶级的路线。远在抗日战争爆发前夕，他就大肆宣扬活命哲学、叛徒哲学，指使某些被捕的“共产党员”投降阶级敌人。以后，又把他们包庇下来，招降纳叛，结党营私，让他们窃踞要位。在抗日战争胜利以后，他鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”，准备向美帝国主义和国民党屈膝投降。全国解放，无产阶级取得政权后，他就拚命反对社会主义革命，主张实行资本主义。一九四九年，他提出欢迎资本家剥削，发展资本主义。一九五○年，他把卖国主义的反动影片《清宫秘史》，称之为“爱国主义”的；他主张大力发展“三马一犁一车式的”富农，反对变工队、互助组，反对发展集体经济，叫嚷“巩固新民主主义秩序”。一九五一年、一九五二年，他主张发展富农经济、发展资本主义，提倡“四大自由”。后来，他又反对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，反对农业合作化，大砍合作社。一九五六年，他迎合国际修正主义思潮，大吹阶级斗争熄灭论。一九六二年，他大刮单干风，鼓吹什么“三自一包”、“三和一少”，反对总路线、反对大跃进、反对人民公社，同时，大量印发他的《修养》。一九六四年，他推行形“左”实右的机会主义路线，破坏社会主义教育运动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，提出和推行资产阶级反动路线。所有这一切，充分说明，长期以来，他反对毛泽东思想，反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，他根本就不是一个马克思主义者。他是资产阶级在我们党内的最大的代表人物，他就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。
    十七年来两条路线的尖锐斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义思想的斗争，是资本主义复辟同无产阶级反复辟的斗争。归根结底是中国走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们，社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段，在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。被推翻了的资产阶级，他们人还在，心不死。没收了他们的物资，没有也不可能没收他们的反动思想。他们每时每刻都在力图复辟。他们采取“打进来”“拉出去”的手段，极力在我们党内寻找他们的代表人物。无产阶级及其先锋队内部，有些人也会被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所打中，蜕化变质成为新的资产阶级分子。总之，社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争，就存在着资本主义复辟的可能。社会上有资产阶级，他们就会渗透到上层建筑中来，渗透到党和政权中来，形成党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这是阶级斗争的客观规律，是不奇怪的，也是不以人们意志为转移的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的总后台，实际上就是资产阶级向我们进攻的总司令。如果不把他揭露出来，让他的阴谋得逞，我们的党和国家就要改变颜色，就会出现全国性的反革命复辟，我们的社会主义制度就会象苏联那样演变为资本主义制度，那就要千百万人头落地，我们就要吃二遍苦，走回头路，就要大大推迟中国革命和世界革命的进程。现在，我们把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来了，这是一个关系到党和国家命运和前途的、具有伟大历史意义的胜利。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他所代表的被推翻的阶级，决不会甘心自己的死亡。要夺回长期以来被他们所盘踞的一切阵地，肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，还是一场严重的斗争。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要从政治上、思想上、理论上，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批深、批透。
    我们人民解放军，是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和培育的、毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅直接领导的无产阶级革命军队，是无产阶级专政的主要工具。我们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，疯狂反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们革命战士一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们一定要站在斗争的最前列，和广大的工农革命群众、革命小将、革命干部一起，对准党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，口诛笔伐，猛烈开火，坚决把他打倒！
    我们要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入揭露党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，剥掉他的所谓“老革命”、“一贯正确”的画皮，彻底批判他的资产阶级反动路线，彻底批判他的修正主义代表作《修养》，把他不要革命，不要无产阶级专政，宣扬资产阶级个人主义，宣扬资产阶级唯心哲学的种种谬论，批倒批臭，把他的反动面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    我军在执行支左、支工、支农等项光荣任务中，要坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，和广大革命群众一起，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及他所制定和推行的资产阶级反动路线。要通过群众性的大批判，促进无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的各种形式的反扑，打垮资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，支援无产阶级革命派夺好权，掌好权，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    全军要深入进行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的两条路线斗争的教育。要把对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的批判，作为教育的重要内容。要广泛搜集、揭露资产阶级反动路线和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的各种具体材料，交给干部战士，使大家了解他们的反动事实，进行彻底批判，肃清其恶劣影响，提高两条路线斗争的自觉性。我们要紧密结合群众性的批判的斗争实践，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，进一步推动部队的思想革命化，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的高潮。
    毛主席教导我们，不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。破就是批判，就是革命。破字当头，立也就在其中了。彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的过程，就是大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的过程。我们要通过对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的批判，通过无产阶级文化大革命，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，把毛泽东思想更深入地贯彻于全党全军全国人民，使毛泽东思想成为全党、全体指战员和全国革命人民的行动准则。这是我们党、我们国家永不变色的最根本的保证。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下胜利前进！　（四月十一日）
