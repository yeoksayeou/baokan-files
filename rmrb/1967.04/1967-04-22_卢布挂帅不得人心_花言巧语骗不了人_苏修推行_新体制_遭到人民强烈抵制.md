The Soviet revisionist leading clique is vigorously promoting the "new system" with the ruble as the boss in various economic sectors of the Soviet Union. However, the facts show that this "new system," which thoroughly undermines the socialist economic foundation, thoroughly buries the fruits of the October Revolution, and thoroughly restores capitalism, is strongly opposed and resisted by the Soviet people.

The secretary of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU in Nizhny Tagil, Sherkov, who actively propagates and promotes the "new system," also has to admit that it is indeed difficult to deceive the Soviet people by trying to pass off black as white and capitalism as communism.

Not long ago, Sherkov published an article titled "Incentives—Not Just Rubles." In the opening of the article, he lamented that recently he has been met with resistance everywhere and is constantly questioned by the masses: "Does the new management system create a sense of private ownership?"

He revealed that "people are worried about how to avoid losing the achievements already made when adopting the new system." Even this city committee secretary had to admit that "if we say this anxiety is groundless, that would be incorrect."

However, Sherkov then, following the instructions of the Soviet revisionist leading clique, wrote: "More and more enterprises are adopting the new system of planning and economic incentives... The slogan of the reform is 'make profits'! This system can be explained as follows: you hand in the profits, and then you can receive your share, increasing personal income."

He said, "We are implementing the payment of hard currency—genuine payment! This, as usual, encourages private ownership and the pursuit of personal gain. 'There is no need to be afraid.'"

Here, Sherkov extensively propagated the capitalist principle of profit-seeking and the supremacy of profits, which the Soviet revisionist leading clique is currently implementing, and declared that there is no need to fear "encouraging private ownership and the pursuit of personal gain." It seems that the promotion of the "new system" is going smoothly. However, he then shifted the topic and fell into sadness again.

He said based on his personal experience that it is difficult to make "people's behavior submit to the single force of money." The Soviet people angrily denounced the "encouragement" of "go sign here, and you will get a ten-ruble bill" as "alms," "corruption," and "disgrace." The Soviet people sneered at and laughed at the Soviet revisionist leading clique's profits and the ruble as the boss.

As a city committee secretary, Sherkov, following the will of the Soviet revisionist leading clique, vigorously promotes the "new system" of restoring capitalism, but he faces strong resistance from the Soviet people. His distress reflects the reactionary policies of the Soviet revisionist leading clique, which are extremely unpopular.

The Soviet people are not weaklings. No matter how the Soviet revisionist leading clique praises the "new system" with flowery words, they cannot deceive the Soviet people; no matter how frantically they take "administrative measures," they cannot suppress the resistance of the Soviet people.

### 卢布挂帅不得人心　花言巧语骗不了人  苏修推行“新体制”遭到人民强烈抵制

    卢布挂帅不得人心　花言巧语骗不了人
    苏修推行“新体制”遭到人民强烈抵制
    新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：苏修领导集团正在苏联经济各部门，大张旗鼓地加紧推行以卢布挂帅的“新体制”。但是事实表明，这个彻底破坏社会主义经济基础，彻底葬送十月革命成果，彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”，受到苏联人民的强烈抵制和反对。
    积极宣扬和推行“新体制”的苏共斯维尔德洛夫斯克州下塔吉尔市委书记谢尔科夫也不得不承认，要把黑的说成白的，要把资本主义说成共产主义，要愚弄苏联人民，是实在难办的事。
    不久前，谢尔科夫发表一篇题为《刺激——这不仅是卢布》的文章。
    他在文章的一开头就哀叹，近来他四处碰壁，到处受到群众的质问：“新的经营体制有没有使人产生私有制的情绪？”
    他透露说，“人们担心的是：在采用新体制的时候如何能不丧失已有的成果。”
    连这个市委书记也只得承认，“如果说这种不安没有根据，恐怕是不正确的。”
    但是谢尔科夫接着却按照苏修领导集团的教训写道：“越来越多的企业改行计划和经济刺激的新体制……改革的口号是‘取得利润！’……这种制度可以作如下的解释：你交了利润，那么就请收下你的一份，私人收入的增加。”
    他说，“我们实行的是付给叮当响的硬币——名副其实的支付！这照例助长私有制和贪图私利的行为。”“这不需要害怕。”
    在这里，谢尔科夫把苏修领导集团正在实行的资本主义的唯利是图、利润至上原则，大肆宣扬了一番，并且宣称“不需要害怕”“助长私有制和贪图私利的行为”。听来，“新体制”的推行似乎又是一帆风顺了。但是，他话题一转又陷入了悲伤之中。
    他根据亲身的体验说，要使“人们的行为服从唯一的金钱的力量”是困难的。苏联人民愤慨地把“你去签个字吧，那里就会给你一张十卢布的钞票”这种“鼓励”，斥之为“施舍”、“腐蚀人”和“名誉扫地”。苏联人民对苏修领导集团的利润和卢布挂帅，嗤之以鼻，“捧腹大笑”。
    作为市委书记的谢尔科夫，秉承苏修领导集团的旨意竭力推行复辟资本主义的“新体制”，受到苏联人民强烈的抵制。他的苦恼反映了苏修领导集团的倒行逆施，是极不得人心的。
    苏联人民绝不是阿斗，不管苏修领导集团如何花言巧语地吹嘘“新体制”，都欺骗不了苏联人民；不管他们如何疯狂采取“行政措施”，都镇压不了苏联人民的反抗。
