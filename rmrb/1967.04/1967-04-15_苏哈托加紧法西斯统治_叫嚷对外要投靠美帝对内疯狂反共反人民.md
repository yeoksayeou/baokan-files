Suharto Tightens Fascist Rule, Shouting Slogans of Allying with U.S. Imperialism Abroad and Ferociously Suppressing Communists and the People at Home

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 14th, in Jakarta, the head of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, Suharto, on the 8th, in a written statement to the press, openly admitted that this fascist regime will continue to pursue a reactionary policy of suppressing communists and the people at home and aligning with U.S. imperialism abroad. This is Suharto's first press conference since he recently usurped presidential power and seized the position of "acting president."

	According to a report by the Antara News Agency on the 10th, Suharto, in his speech, tried to cover up the dictatorial nature of the right-wing military regime, but he boasted that the right-wing military had played a more prominent political role in the past period of military suppression and viciously declared that the right-wing military would be at the forefront of continuing to "spiritually and physically annihilate" the Communist Party and patriotic forces.

	Suharto, on the one hand, threatened the Indonesian people, warning them that "the efficiency and output of every means of production must of course be raised to the highest limit," while on the other hand, he used the pretext of "not allowing slanderous propaganda" to prohibit the Indonesian people from expressing any dissatisfaction with the fascist rule of the right-wing regime.

	Suharto also announced in his speech that the right-wing military regime is drafting two bills, one on so-called "universal suffrage" and one on the party system, in order to control the "universal suffrage" farce scheduled for 1968.

	Suharto defended the reactionary policy of the right-wing military regime to turn Indonesia into an American colony, claiming that this treacherous regime's selling of Indonesian national resources and national interests to the United States and other countries' monopolies is for the purpose of "developing our (Indonesian) national economy."

	Suharto also tried to portray the right-wing military regime as pursuing an "active and independent" foreign policy, but he also supported the U.S. conspiracy for "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue, saying that he "hopes the Vietnam War will be resolved peacefully as soon as possible."

    苏哈托加紧法西斯统治
    叫嚷对外要投靠美帝对内疯狂反共反人民
    据新华社十四日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权的头目苏哈托，八日在记者招待会上发表书面讲话，公开承认这个法西斯政权将继续奉行对内反共反人民对外投靠美帝国主义的反动政策。这是苏哈托在最近篡夺总统权力窃取“代总统”职务后举行的第一次记者招待会。
    据安塔拉通讯社十日报道，苏哈托在讲话中极力掩盖右派军人政权的独裁面目，但是他又吹嘘右派军队前一个时期在实行军事镇压方面“起了比过去更突出的政治作用”，并且恶狠狠地叫嚷右派军队将要在继续从“精神上肉体上粉碎”共产党和爱国力量方面“站在前线”。
    苏哈托一方面威胁印尼人民，警告他们“每一生产工具的效率和产量当然必须提高到最高限度”，同时又拿出“不许进行诽谤性宣传”的罪名，来禁止印尼人民对右派政权的法西斯统治表示任何不满。
    苏哈托在讲话中还宣布，右派军人政权正在草拟所谓“普选”和有关政党制度的两项法案，以便控制预定在一九六八年上演的“普选”丑剧。
    苏哈托为右派军人政权的推行变印尼为美国殖民地的反动政策辩解，他把这个卖国政权向美国和其他国家的垄断资本出卖印尼国家资源和民族利益，说成是为了“发展我们（印尼）的民族经济”。
    苏哈托还极力把右派军人政权装扮成奉行“积极的独立的”外交政策的，但他又为美国在越南问题上的“和谈”阴谋帮腔，说什么“希望越南战争立即得到和平解决”。
