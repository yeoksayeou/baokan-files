The Shanghai Ink Factory, which is responsible for producing high-grade ink used to print the works of Chairman Mao, has, under the guidance of revolutionary spirit, overcome numerous difficulties and completed its first quarter ink production task nine days ahead of schedule and above the target.

With the vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the demand for ink has been increasing. In the first quarter of this year, the factory's ink production task increased by 34.4 percent compared to the same period last year. Among these, the demand for high-quality ink used to print the works of Chairman Mao increased by 2.8 times compared to last year. To complete such a heavy task, the revolutionary workers and cadres of the factory have put politics in command, overcoming many difficulties in manpower, equipment, and raw material supply. They have shortened the processing time for each batch of ink by one-fifth to one-fourth. After reading the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country," the revolutionary workers and cadres of the entire factory were even more enthusiastic and continuously increased the daily ink production from the original 8.5 tons to around 11 tons.

    上海油墨厂
    优质高产完成一季度生产任务
    担负生产印刷毛主席著作所用高级油墨的上海油墨厂全体革命职工和革命干部，以革命统帅生产，克服重重困难，提前九天超额完成了第一季度的油墨生产任务。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃开展，油墨的需要量越来越大。今年第一季度，这个厂的油墨生产任务比去年同期增长了百分之三十四点四，其中质量要求极高的、印刷毛主席著作用的油墨，比去年增加了二点八倍。为了完成这样的繁重任务，这个厂的革命职工和革命干部突出政治，克服了人力、设备和原料供应等方面的许多困难，使每料加工时间缩短了五分之一到四分之一。全厂革命职工和革命干部读了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》以后，更是欢欣鼓舞，连续把油墨日产量从原来的八吨半提高到十一吨左右。
