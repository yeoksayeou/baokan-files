The military and civilians of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of people's war. In the first three months of this year, they launched a series of fierce attacks against the enemy, annihilating a total of 8,478 enemy soldiers, delivering a crushing blow to the so-called "pacification" plan of the U.S.-puppet clique.

Among the more than 8,400 enemy soldiers annihilated by the military and civilians of Quang Ngai Province were 3,568 U.S. aggressor troops and 1,172 South Korean mercenary troops. They completely wiped out three enemy battalions, eight companies, and 32 platoons, and severely decimated three puppet army main force battalions. In addition, the liberation armed forces shot down 73 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 68 military vehicles, demolished 27 enemy fortifications, and forced the enemy to withdraw from 12 outposts.

The report said that in the first quarter, the military and civilians of Quang Ngai Province worked closely together, not only repeatedly foiling the enemy's numerous "sweeping" operations but also launching attacks on a series of enemy outposts around many towns. They also frequently raided enemy command posts in county towns, attacked airfields and artillery positions, and cut off many major transportation routes, annihilating the enemy by entire companies and battalions. On February 15, the liberation armed forces stormed into the battle positions of the South Korean mercenary troops stationed in the Quang Thanh area of Tra Bong County, catching the enemy off guard and completely annihilating and severely decimating an enemy battalion and several companies. On February 17, the liberation armed forces in the Te River Valley completely annihilated and severely decimated two puppet army regiments that had come to conduct "sweeping" operations.

In the battles, guerrilla warfare has developed significantly. Many communes and villages' guerrilla units have independently annihilated entire squads or platoons of the enemy. The guerrilla units and local forces of Deo County, in the first two months of this year, annihilated 1,200 U.S. aggressor troops, including an entire company and four platoons of U.S. troops; shot down 27 enemy aircraft; and controlled and cut off the first-class road from Mo Duc to Deo.

According to a supplementary report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on April 5, the liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province, while attacking the puppet special forces training camp in Long Thuy and ambushing U.S. troops conducting "sweeping" operations in Dong Hu, killed and wounded more than 400 enemy soldiers, including more than 200 U.S. aggressor troops.

    新华社河内十五日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省军民发挥人民战争的无比威力，在今年头三个月内接连向敌人发动猛烈攻击，共歼灭敌人八千四百七十八名，给了美伪集团进行的所谓重点“绥靖”计划以粉碎性的打击。
