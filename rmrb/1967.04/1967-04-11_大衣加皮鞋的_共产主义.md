According to reports, the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to "welcome" the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, ordered factories to speed up the production of various consumer goods to fill the store shelves. At the same time, they instructed the foreign trade department to import large quantities of goods from capitalist countries, including ordering 8 million pounds worth of colorful women's short overcoats and blouses from Britain, fashionable leather shoes, men's clothing and overcoats, and 10 million pounds worth of textiles from Japan. Everything is colorful and complete.

The Soviet revisionist clique is so busy preparing for the "New Year's goods," merely wanting to use these colorful commodities to decorate their facade and show off their so-called "achievements" in "building communism," thereby covering up their betrayal of the October Revolution.

However, this approach is utterly absurd and laughable.

If one were to say that the hallmark of communism lies in the commodities on the shelves, then the shelves in the United States are quite full. Can one say that the United States is building communism? Your eagerness to produce consumer goods to display the so-called "achievements" in "building communism," even relying on large purchases of foreign goods to fill the shelves, precisely shows that what you are doing is not true communism, but rather the "communism" of potatoes and beef, the "communism" of overcoats and leather shoes, and moreover, the "communism" of Western overcoats and Western leather shoes!

The Soviet revisionist clique are traitors to the October Revolution and have no right to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution. You have usurped the power of the Soviet Union, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, and within the country, you are carrying out a capitalist restoration, burying the achievements of the October Revolution; internationally, you are colluding with American imperialism, opposing the world revolution, and betraying the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the whole world. When the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution arrives, the Soviet people and the people of the whole world will see more clearly your traitorous faces and will rise up with indignation to oppose you, this small handful of criminals in history! The heinous crimes you have committed are such that even the waters of the Pacific Ocean cannot wash away, can a few more overcoats and pairs of leather shoes on the shelves cover them up?

### 大衣加皮鞋的“共产主义”

    大衣加皮鞋的“共产主义”
    据报道，苏修集团为了“迎接”十月革命五十周年，下令工厂加紧生产各种消费品，以便把商店的货架子摆得满满的。同时，他们还要外贸部门向资本主义各国进口大批商品，其中包括向英国订购价值八百万英镑的颜色漂亮的妇女短大衣和上衣，时新的皮鞋，男人衣服和大衣，向日本订购价值一千万英镑的纺织品。五光十色，一应俱全。
    苏修集团这样忙于办“年货”，无非是想用这些花花绿绿的商品，来装潢一下门面，显示一下他们所谓的“共产主义建设”的“成果”，借以掩饰自己对十月革命的背叛。
    然而，这种做法是十分荒唐可笑的。
    如果说，共产主义的标志，在于货架上的商品，那末，美国货架上的商品倒是不少，难道能够说美国在建设共产主义吗？你们这样热中于赶制消费品来显示所谓“共产主义建设”的“成果”，甚至依靠大买外国货来填塞货架子，这恰恰说明你们搞的不是真共产主义，而是土豆加牛肉的“共产主义”，是大衣加皮鞋的“共产主义”，而且是西方大衣加西方皮鞋的“共产主义”！
    苏修集团是十月革命的叛徒，根本没有资格纪念伟大十月革命五十周年。你们篡夺了苏联的政权，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，在国内大搞资本主义复辟，葬送十月革命的成果；在国际上勾结美帝国主义，反对世界革命，叛卖苏联人民和全世界人民的利益。当十月革命五十周年来临的时候，苏联人民和全世界人民将更加看清你们的叛徒面目，更加怀着满腔的愤怒起来反对你们这一小撮历史的罪人！你们犯下的滔天罪行，是倾太平洋之水也洗不清的，难道在货架上多摆几件大衣、几双皮鞋，就可以掩盖得了吗？
