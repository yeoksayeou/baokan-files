	Xianyang in Shaanxi Province organized industrial and handicraft workers to go to the countryside to repair farm tools, which has been praised by poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Currently, the entire prefecture has 83 service teams actively working on the front lines of spring plowing in rural areas. They divide the work by areas, ensuring that each team has someone in charge and that all types of farm tools have someone to repair them. According to statistics, by March 20, the mobile service teams had repaired a total of 119,000 farm tools. Including those repaired at factories and communes, the number of farm tools repaired this year is more than any previous year during the same period.

	The teams going to the countryside often study Chairman Mao's works together with the commune members, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and help the communes and production teams train many technical personnel.

    咸阳组织服务队下乡修理农具
    陕西省咸阳专区工业、手工业系统的革命职工，为了更好地为农村服务，组织流动服务队下乡修理农具，受到贫下中农称赞。
    现在，全专区共有八十三个服务队活跃在农村春耕第一线。他们分片包干，做到了队队有人管，各种农具有人修。据统计，截至三月二十日，流动服务队共修理各种农具达十一万九千多件，加上在厂社修理的，今年已修理的农具比以往任何一年的同期都多。
    下乡服务队还经常同社员们一起学习毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，并且帮助社队培训了许多技术人员。　　（新华社讯）
