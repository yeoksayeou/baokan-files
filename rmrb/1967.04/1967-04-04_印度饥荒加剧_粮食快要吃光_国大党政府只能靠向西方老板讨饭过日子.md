The famine in India, caused by the reactionary policies of the Indian government, is becoming increasingly severe. Even the Indian government has begun to admit that this year's famine will be more serious than the worst one since independence last year.

The Indian government acknowledged in a report to the parliament on March 27 that the supply of wheat and millet will only last until the end of June this year. The supply of rice will be even more difficult. The famine situation in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh may worsen in the next two to three months. According to foreign news agencies, Bihar is already facing a disastrous famine. An official from the state revealed that out of the 360 million people in the state, approximately 320 million are already suffering from famine, and the situation is still deteriorating.

The central government of Madhya Pradesh has ordered a further reduction of 33% in the already meager wheat rations for the entire state, with each person only able to receive 4 kilograms per month.

Kerala is also facing a severe famine, and the state government has requested that the central government immediately supply 140,000 tons of rice for emergency relief.

In reality, according to Indian newspapers, people in various states often cannot even purchase their allocated rations of food.

The only measure taken by the reactionary Indian government to deal with the famine is to continue begging for food from Western countries. The Indian government emphasized in its report to the parliament on March 27 that the food supply for the second half of this year depends on how much food can be imported.

    印度饥荒加剧　粮食快要吃光
    国大党政府只能靠向西方老板讨饭过日子
    据新华社二日讯　新德里消息：印度政府的反动政策所造成的粮荒，愈来愈严重。连印度官方也不得不开始透露，今年粮荒的严重程度，将超过独立以来最严重的去年。
    印度政府三月二十七日在向议会提出的一个关于粮食情况的报告承认，小麦和粟类的供应将只能维持到今年六月底。大米的供应将更加困难。比哈尔邦和北方邦的粮荒情况在今后两三个月内可能加重。据外国通讯社报道，比哈尔邦“已经受到灾难性的饥饿威胁”。这个邦的一名官员透露，这个邦的三百六十万人中已经有大约三百二十万人遭受饥荒。情况还正在恶化。
    中央邦政府已经下令把全邦已经很少的小麦配给量再减少百分之三十三，每人每月只能配给四公斤。
    喀拉拉邦也出现了严重的粮荒，邦政府要求中央政府立即供应十四万吨大米去应急。
    实际上，据印度报纸报道，在印度各邦内，人民常常买不到配给的粮食。
    印度反动政府应付粮荒的唯一做法是继续向西方国家乞讨粮食。印度政府在三月二十七日向议会提出的报告中强调今年下半年的粮食供应取决于能够进口多少粮食。
