The Soviet revisionist clique's open collusion with the notorious "Malaysian" puppet regime is a disgraceful affair. However, the Soviet revisionist clique not only does not consider it shameful but also has the *Pravda* newspaper lavishly praising this puppet regime, portraying their attempt to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet revisionist clique as a "major shift in Malaysian foreign policy."

Is it that the "Malaysian" puppet regime is no longer acting as a lackey of U.S. and British imperialism? Of course not.

Is it that the "Malaysian" puppet regime has abandoned its anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people policies? Of course not.

Then, what is this so-called "major shift" all about? The matter is quite clear: what has changed is merely the Soviet revisionist clique's attitude towards the "Malaysian" puppet regime.

You have always been deeply infatuated with this product of neo-colonialism. On the day of its birth, you rushed to send a congratulatory telegram. When it sought to join the United Nations, you raised your hands in approval. In short, you have always been cozying up to it.

In fact, this cozying up is not surprising at all. One is a lackey of U.S. imperialism, and the other is a henchman of U.S. imperialism. At a time when the counter-revolutionary forces around the world are intensifying their "joint actions" and hastening to establish a new "holy alliance" with U.S. imperialism as the leader, it is natural that puppets and traitors should find each other repulsive and quickly come to an agreement. *Pravda* jokes that the "Malaysian" puppet regime agreed to establish relations with the Soviet revisionists because it "realistically assessed the situation on the international stage." This does make some sense. In the face of the current situation where U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are tightening their global collusion, how could the Rahman regime, as a lackey of U.S. imperialism, not adopt a "realistic" attitude?

    臭味相投
    苏修集团同臭名昭著的“马来西亚”傀儡政权公开勾结，是丑得很的事情。但是，苏修集团不仅不以为耻，反而由《真理报》大肆吹捧这个傀儡政权，把他们要同苏修集团建立外交关系的勾当，说成是什么“马来西亚对外政策的重大转变”。
    难道是“马来西亚”傀儡政权不再充当美英帝国主义的走狗了吗？当然并非如此。
    难道是“马来西亚”傀儡政权放弃反共反华反人民的政策了吗？当然更非如此。
    那末，所谓“重大转变”又从何谈起呢？事情很清楚，发生了“转变”的，不过是苏修集团自己对“马来西亚”傀儡集团的做法而已。
    你们对这个新殖民主义的产物，是“一往情深”的。它出生之日，你们赶忙致电祝贺。它要参加联合国，你们举起双手赞成。总之，你们是一直在同它勾勾搭搭的。
    其实，这种勾勾搭搭是毫不奇怪的。一个是美帝国主义的走狗，一个是美帝国主义的帮凶。在今天全世界反革命势力正在大搞“联合行动”，加紧建立以美帝国主义为盟主的新“神圣同盟”的时候，傀儡和叛徒自然臭味相投，一拍即合。《真理报》自我解嘲地说什么“马来西亚”傀儡集团同意同苏修建交，是因为它“现实主义地评价了国际舞台上形成的局势”。这倒是有几分道理的。对于当前美帝苏修加紧全球大勾结的局势，作为美帝国主义走狗的拉赫曼政权，又怎能不采取一种“现实主义”的态度呢？
