In the sharp and intense class struggle, all true Marxist-Leninists, all revolutionaries of the proletariat, must possess the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. In any situation, they must always distinguish between friend and foe, and with unparalleled heroic spirit, they must overwhelm all enemies and never be subdued by them. Proletarian revolutionaries must never betray the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, nor damage the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue the struggle." He also says: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the sufferings of the majority of the people. To die for the people is to die with dignity." Devote oneself to the revolution, do everything for the revolution, live for the revolution, and die for the revolution. "Brow furrowed, coldly facing a thousand accusers, bowing the head, willingly becoming an ox for the children," this is the political quality of proletarian revolutionaries.

"Beheading is nothing, as long as the cause is true," this is the manifestation of the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Because proletarian revolutionaries are selfless, they have only the interests of the class and the people, and no personal selfish motives. Therefore, in the face of the enemy, they can be unyielding and fearless. To defend the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to defend the revolutionary interests of the proletariat and socialism and communism, they can sacrifice everything, including their own lives.

However, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, China's Khrushchev, has always used the pretext of the cultivation of Communist Party members to peddle the reactionary bourgeois philosophy of survival, advocating the philosophy of traitors. In his book "Cultivation," he talks about how a Communist Party member, "he may also have the highest self-respect and self-love, but in the premise of the interests of the Party and the revolution, he can be the most tolerant, forgiving, and accommodating... he can also cherish himself, protect his own life and health, and improve his theory and abilities for the sake of the Party and the revolution." As for the organizational aspect of the Party, he also says: "The Party also, under possible conditions, considers and protects the indispensable interests of individual Party members—such as providing them with educational and learning opportunities, solving their illnesses and family problems, and even, if necessary, sacrificing some of the Party's work to preserve comrades."

In this thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary fallacy of China's Khrushchev, the so-called "for the sake of the Party and the revolution" and the like are just deceptive pretexts. Its true content is to advocate personal "self-respect and self-love," "cherishing oneself, protecting one's own life and health," and even "sacrificing some of the Party's work to preserve comrades' lives." In the end, it is all about the individual first, personal interests first, and personal life first. This is in complete harmony with the survivalist philosophy propagated by Khrushchev and his ilk, such as "survival is everything," "people all want to live," "everyone wants to live better," and "there are no principles without a head," and "the policies of the Communist Party are the highest policies of human emotions." They are all thoroughly reactionary bourgeois survivalism and counter-revolutionary revisionist traitorous philosophy.

It is precisely because in the heart of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, China's Khrushchev, survival comes first, that in the past he advocated the so-called "policy of false surrender," euphemistically called "preserving strength" and "seeking legal existence." He even turned the act of surrendering and defecting into a manifestation of revolutionary spirit, saying: "The revolutionary spirit of a Communist is concrete, not abstract. This is the concrete revolutionary spirit of a Communist." In this way, isn't the act of betrayal and defection also a so-called "concrete revolutionary spirit of a Communist"? This is truly a shameless traitorous philosophy. In reality, the so-called "concrete revolutionary spirit of a Communist" of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party is nothing more than survival first, survival is everything, which is the survivalism of Khrushchev and his ilk, that is, there are no principles without a head. His traitorous philosophy is precisely centered on this reactionary bourgeois survivalism.

How does he defend the traitorous philosophy he advocates? That is, how does he defend the act of betrayal and defection? First, he says that what he means is false surrender, surrender and defection are false, preserving strength is true; second, he "cherishes himself, protects his own life" for the sake of the "Party and the revolution"; third, defection and surrender are just a flaw, one should see a person's contributions and merits, and not erase them with one stroke. Because of this, traitors can become "revolutionary heroes"; defectors can become people with a "concrete revolutionary spirit of a Communist." Such people use this traitorous sophistry to engage in the activities of surrendering and accepting traitors, forming cliques, and plotting to usurp the Party and the government and restore capitalism.

"The Cultivation" is a genuine product of revisionism. It propagates the worldview of Confucianism and bourgeois individualism, containing the Confucianism of the feudal class, the philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" and the bourgeois survivalism, the tactics of clique-forming of the exploiting class, and the sophistry of traitors.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique, in order to turn contemporary traitors into "revolutionaries," also want to turn historical traitors into "national heroes." In September 1963, the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements led by Zhou Yang personally led the attack on Comrade Teng Benyu's revolutionary article "Critique of Li Xucheng's Autobiography," attempting to suppress the criticism of the traitor Li Xucheng, because they were afraid of touching their "big figures"—China's Khrushchev's traitorous sophistry. Zhou Yang even shouted: "Li Xucheng is a national hero, calling him a traitor is wrong." These people do not allow others to call traitors traitors, insisting on calling traitors "national heroes," because they have ulterior motives, fearing that their true colors of surrendering and accepting traitors will be exposed.

This traitorous philosophy is the sophistry of all acts of defection, surrender, betrayal of the revolution, and betrayal to the enemy. It is a reactionary fallacy that blurs the line between enemy and self and covers up for traitors. Against the propagators of this traitorous sophistry—the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must rebel against them, overthrow them, and decisively defeat them, stomping them down and never allowing them to rise again. According to the teachings of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, all proletarian revolutionaries must pay attention to both early and late integrity. Cherishing one's proletarian revolutionary integrity must surpass cherishing one's own life. No matter who a person is, even if they have done ninety-nine good deeds, but in the end did one bad deed of betraying the revolution, then they are a traitor and should be erased with one stroke.

"Plum blossoms rejoice in the snow." Proletarian revolutionaries are the tough bones armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the heroes who look down on all the scoundrels in the world. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose, thoroughly criticize, and thoroughly overthrow the philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," the tactics of clique-forming, and even the sophistry of traitors propagated by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party.

    把中国的赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学彻底批臭
    洪斌
    在尖锐激烈的阶级斗争中，一切真正的马克思列宁主义者，无产阶级的革命战士，必须具有无产阶级的革命气节，无论在什么情况下，总是敌我分明，以无比的英雄气概去压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。无产阶级革命者决不能背叛马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则，损害无产阶级的革命气节。毛主席教导我们：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”又说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”一心为革命，一切为革命，为革命而生，为革命而死，“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，这就是无产阶级革命者的政治品质。
      “砍头不要紧，只要主义真”，这就是无产阶级革命气节的表现。因为无产阶级的革命者，是一心为公的，他只有阶级的、人民的利益，没有个人的自私自利的目的，所以在敌人面前能够不屈不挠，无所畏惧。为了捍卫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命原则，为了捍卫无产阶级社会主义和共产主义的革命利益，能够付出自己的一切，包括付出自己的生命在内。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫，却一贯地在大讲什么共产党员修养的幌子下，推销反动资产阶级的活命哲学，鼓吹叛徒的哲学。他在《修养》中说什么：一个共产党员，“他也可能有最高的自尊心，自爱心，而在为了党与革命利益的前提之下，也最能宽大、容忍与委曲求全，……他也能够为了党与革命的利益而钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康，增进自己的理论与能力。”至于从党的组织方面来说，还说什么：“党也在可能条件下顾全与保护党员个人的不可缺少的利益——如给他以教育学习的机会，解决他的疾病与家庭问题，以至在必要时牺牲党的一些工作保存同志等。”
    在这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的这种彻头彻尾反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动谬论中，所谓“为了党与革命的利益”之类的说法，不过是骗人的幌子而已。它的真正内容，则是鼓吹个人的“自尊心，自爱心”，“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，以至“在必要时牺牲党的一些工作保存同志”的生命等等。说来说去，个人第一，个人的私利第一，个人的生命第一。这同赫鲁晓夫之流所宣扬的活命就是一切，“人们都希望活着”，“每一个人都希望过得更好”，以及什么没有脑袋还有什么原则、共产党的政策是“最高人情的政策”等等，完全是一个调子。都是彻头彻尾的反动资产阶级的活命论，都是反革命修正主义的叛徒哲学。
    正因为在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫的内心世界中，完全是活命第一，所以他在过去就鼓吹什么“假自首政策”，美其名曰“保存力量”，“争取合法存在”。甚至把自首变节行为，说成是革命气节的表现，说什么：“共产党人的革命气节是具体的，不是抽象的，这样做正是具体的共产党人的革命气节。”如此说来，那种叛变投敌、变节自首的行为，不也成了所谓“具体的共产党人的革命气节”了吗！这真是不折不扣的无耻的叛徒哲学。实际上，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所谓的“具体的共产党人的革命气节”，不过是活命第一，活命就是一切，也就是赫鲁晓夫之流所谓没有脑袋还有什么原则的活命论。他的叛徒哲学，正是以这种反动资产阶级的活命论为核心的。
    他是怎样替自己所鼓吹的叛徒哲学进行诡辩的呢？也就是说，是怎样为那种背叛变节行为进行诡辩的呢？一曰我说的是假自首，自首变节是假，保存力量是真；二曰我“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命”，是为了“党与革命的利益”；三曰变节自首只是一个缺点，应当看到一个人的贡献和功劳，不应一笔抹煞。正因为是这样，所以叛变投敌的人，可以成为“革命的英雄”；变节分子，可以成为一个具有“具体的共产党人的革命气节”的人。这种人正是用这种叛徒的诡辩论，大搞其招降纳叛、结党营私的勾当，进行其篡党篡政、复辟资本主义的阴谋活动。
    《修养》一书，是地地道道的修正主义的货色。它宣扬的是孔孟之道和资产阶级个人主义的世界观，其中有封建阶级的孔孟之道，有“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学和资产阶级的活命论，有剥削阶级结党营私的权术，还有叛徒的诡辩术。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其一伙，为了要把当代的叛徒说成“革命者”，还要把历史上的叛徒说成“民族英雄”。一九六三年九月，反革命修正主义分子周扬之流，之所以亲自出马，带头围攻戚本禹同志《评李秀成自述》这篇革命文章，力图把对于叛徒李秀成的批判压下去，就是因为怕触动了他们的“大人物”——中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒的诡辩论。周扬还叫喊什么：“李秀成是一个民族英雄，把他说成叛徒是错误的。”这伙人不许别人把叛徒叫做叛徒，硬要把叛徒说成“民族英雄”，是因为心中有鬼，怕暴露了他们招降纳叛的本来面貌。
    这种叛徒的哲学，是一切变节自首、背叛革命、叛变投敌行为的诡辩论，是抹煞敌我界线而替叛徒打掩护的反动谬论。对于这种叛徒诡辩论的宣扬者——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其一小撮反革命修正主义分子，我们必须造他们的反，革他们的命，坚决把他们打倒在地，再踏上一只脚，让他们永世不得翻身。根据我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席历来的教导，我们一切无产阶级的革命者，必须注意大节和晚节。爱护自己的无产阶级革命的大节和晚节，必须超过爱护自己的生命。一个人，不管他是谁，即使曾经做了九十九件好事，而在最后做了一件背叛革命的大坏事，那他就是一个叛徒，就应当对他一笔抹煞。
      “梅花欢喜漫天雪”。无产阶级的革命者是毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头，是傲视人间一切蟊贼的英雄汉。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派宣扬的什么“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学，结党营私的权术，以至叛徒的诡辩论，加以彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底打倒。
