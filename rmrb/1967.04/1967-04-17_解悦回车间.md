Half a month ago, on a certain night, the spinning workshop of the Taiyuan Textile Mill was unusually lively. People were excitedly spreading the good news: "Xie Yue has returned to the workshop!"

As midnight approached, the workers of the day shift were reluctant to leave, and the Red Guard soldiers of the workshop gathered together. The military representatives who came to assist the factory also rushed over. Everyone was welcoming this pioneer of the Cultural Revolution and production expert of the textile industry back to the production front line.

The section chief of the spinning workshop, Fan Lianqing, and the group leader of Xie Yue's group, Zhou Runhua, both happily said: "We have been looking forward to Xie Yue's return for a long time, but at that time we had to consider the needs of the struggle. Now that we workers are in power, she returns to the front line, studies, works, and fights with us, and we can carry the two burdens of revolution and production even better."

Twenty minutes before the night shift started, Xie Yue and her group members arrived at the spinning machine ahead of time. Xie Yue casually picked up two flower-picking needles and began the cleaning work deftly. Her swift movements attracted everyone's attention. Everyone was discussing: "Xie Yue seems like she never left her spinning machine!"

Indeed, Xie Yue had never forgotten Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and her heart had never left the spinning machine.

Incorporating Chairman Mao's Instructions into Her Blood

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, Xie Yue was elected as the deputy director of the factory's Cultural Revolution Committee. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory party committee tried to make this advanced producer join their ranks, repeatedly issuing orders to remove her from the production post, all of which were firmly rejected by Xie Yue. She said: "The Sixteen Points were personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and not a single word tells workers to leave production to make revolution. I am a worker, so I must listen to Chairman Mao's words!"

The struggle became increasingly fierce. The revolutionary faction established its own organization—the Taiyuan Textile Mill Red Guard. Everyone elected Xie Yue as the commander. She continued to lead the revolutionary faction to work and produce during the day and make revolution in her spare time.

Xie Yue, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, raised the revolutionary banner of "rebellion is justified," leading revolutionary workers to fiercely attack the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory party committee, making the enemy both fearful and hateful. They used both soft and hard tactics, trying to make Xie Yue give up the struggle. After August 26 of last year, the white terror manufactured by the capitalist roaders within the factory spread throughout the factory. The Red Guard was brutally besieged. However, Xie Yue and her comrades became more and more determined, and their resolve to defend the production post never wavered.

The class enemy incited some workers who were unaware of the truth to stop production and demonstrate against the revolutionary faction. Some Red Guard soldiers were besieged in a building, and Xie Yue studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone. As soon as it was time to go to work, she and everyone else formed an ironclad team, holding the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and singing the "Little Red Book" songs, breaking through the siege and heading to the workshop.

One day, Xie Yue had just started the spinning machine when more than 200 "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards," who were deceived and manipulated by the capitalist roaders, surrounded her. They cursed and mocked her, besieging her for eight hours. Xie Yue remembered Chairman Mao's poem, "The enemy's encirclement is as heavy as mountains, but I stand firm and unyielding," and calmly managed her 1,600 spindles.

In early January of this year, Xie Yue was injured and hospitalized. The doctor told her to rest for seven days; before two days had passed, she returned to the spinning machine.

Until the Cultural Revolution in Taiyuan Textile Mill entered the decisive stage of seizing power, Xie Yue had to temporarily leave the production post on January 13 to participate in the command of this great struggle. Even during this period, whenever there was a break in the battle, Xie Yue would return to the workshop to work.

This active learner of Chairman Mao's works truly incorporated Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" into her blood.

Making New Choices in a New Situation

On January 26, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Textile Mill seized power successfully. The Red Guard and other revolutionary organizations united, together with revolutionary cadres, formed a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ, taking control of all power in the factory. Xie Yue was elected by the revolutionary workers as the deputy director of the Taiyuan Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee. She is also a standing committee member of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and a committee member of the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Xie Yue has grown and tempered through fierce class struggles. From an ordinary textile worker, she has become a leader of revolution and production, shouldering an even heavier burden.

Xie Yue faced a new situation and needed to make new choices: should she return to the production post? She firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instructions for cadres to participate in and lead production, remembered Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses. She resolutely decided: to return to the workshop.

As early as March 13, she decided with Chen Yonggui and Li Shunda to disband the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Headquarters led by them, calling on comrades to return to their hometowns to make revolution locally.

On March 24, on the seventh-month anniversary of the founding of the Taiyuan Textile Mill Red Guard, she and all the responsible personnel of the headquarters wrote a resolution, announcing their immediate return to the production and work posts.

On that day, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution and promote production" together, and studied the "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to all revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country." Everyone agreed that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee required "workers in worker organizations to generally not leave production," calling on the working class to carry the dual burdens of revolution and production well, "becoming the most outstanding models of grasping revolution and promoting production in the laboring masses of the current stage." The proletarian revolutionary faction should strictly follow these instructions.

They also analyzed the factory's revolutionary and production situation together: with the support and help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team sent by the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, the proletarian revolutionary faction, after two months of arduous struggle, had basically overthrown, smashed, and exposed the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory party committee. The "Taiyuan Textile Red Guards" manipulated by this small clique of bad elements had collapsed, and the vast majority of the deceived masses had awakened. The "three-in-one" revolutionary committee had been established, and the factory had established a good order of revolution and production, with production reaching a new high. Under these circumstances, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations must focus their work on the production front line, go deep among the masses, take the lead in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, grasp revolution, promote production, thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots in the enterprise, and gradually turn the enterprise into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xie Yue and her comrades in the Red Guard headquarters, with this new combat mission, returned to the production and work front lines.

During breaks, Xie Yue and her group members sat closely together by the spinning machine to study Chairman Mao's quotations. The group leader, on behalf of everyone, welcomed Xie Yue and specially read a quotation: "Hard work is like a burden placed in front of us, see if we dare to bear it.... Let others enjoy, pick the heavy burden, suffer first, and enjoy last. Such comrades are good comrades. This communist spirit, we all need to learn." This was everyone's praise and expectation for Xie Yue.

Half a month has passed, and Xie Yue has not let down her comrades' expectations, taking the burden of grasping revolution and promoting production very seriously. She always puts revolution first, actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works with her comrades, carries out criticism and self-criticism, and promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking. She makes full use of her spare time and the necessary work time arranged by the factory to undertake the work of the factory revolutionary committee. She often brings the opinions of the masses up and brings the opinions of the leadership down, constantly strengthening the relationship between the leadership and the masses.

### 解悦回车间

    解悦回车间
    半个月以前的一天夜里，太原纺织厂细纱车间分外活跃。
    人们兴奋地传播着一个好消息：“解悦回车间了！”
    午夜将近，交好班的中班工人还迟迟不肯离去，车间红卫队的战士们聚拢过来，进厂协助工作的部队代表也赶来了……。大家都在欢迎这位文化大革命中的闯将、纺织工业战线上的生产能手回到生产第一线上来。
    细纱车间的工段长范莲青和解悦所在小组的小组长周润华，都高兴地说：“我们很早就盼解悦回来，可是那时不能不考虑斗争的需要。现在我们工人自己掌权了，她回到第一线来，经常和我们一起学习、一起劳动、一起战斗，就可以把革命和生产的两副担子挑得更好。”
    离夜班上工还差二十分钟，解悦和她小组的战友们，就提前来到了纺纱机前。解悦顺手拿起两根咬花钎，轻捷地做起清洁工作来。她的飞快的动作，吸引着人们的注意。大家纷纷议论着：“解悦好象一天也没有离开过自己的纺纱机！”
    的确，解悦一时一刻也没有忘记毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，她的心一时一刻也没有离开过纺纱机。
    把毛主席的指示溶化在血液里
    文化大革命运动初期，解悦被选为厂里文化革命委员会副主任。厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，想使这位先进生产者和他们一伙人同流合污，多次下调令要她脱离生产岗位，都遭到解悦的坚决拒绝。她说：“十六条是毛主席亲自主持制定的，没有一句话要工人脱产闹革命，而是要求工人抓革命、促生产。我是个工人，就要听毛主席的话！”
    斗争越来越尖锐了。革命派成立了自己的组织——太原纺织厂红卫队，大家推选解悦担任了指导员。她继续带领革命派战士上班搞生产，业余闹革命。
    解悦这个学习毛主席著作的积极分子，高举“造反有理”的革命大旗，带领革命职工向厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛打猛冲，使敌人怕得要命，恨得要死。他们软硬兼施，又打又拉，妄图让解悦放弃斗争。从去年八月二十六日以后，厂内走资本主义道路当权派制造的白色恐怖，笼罩全厂。红卫队遭到了残酷的围攻。但是，解悦和她的战友们斗志越来越高，坚守生产岗位的决心一刻也没有动摇。
    阶级敌人煽动一些不明真相的工人停止生产，向革命派示威。红卫队的一些战士被围困在一座楼房里，解悦就和大家一起学习毛主席著作。一到上工的时间，她又和大家结成一支钢铁般的队伍，高举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，高唱着语录歌，冲出重围，走向车间。
    一天，解悦刚开动纺纱机，二百多名受走资本主义道路当权派蒙蔽和操纵的“太纺红卫兵”就围了上来。谩骂，讽刺，整整围攻了八个小时。解悦想起毛主席的“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动”的诗句，沉着地看管着一千六百枚纱锭。
    今年一月初，解悦被打伤了，住进医院。医生让她休息七天；连两天还没到，她又回到纺纱机前。
    直到太原纺织厂的文化大革命进入夺权斗争的决战阶段，解悦才不得不在一月十三日暂时离开生产岗位，参加这场大搏斗的指挥工作。就是在这段时期内，每逢战斗的间隙，解悦仍然回到车间劳动。
    这位学习毛主席著作的积极分子，真正把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召溶化到自己的血液中了。
    在新的形势下作出新的抉择
    一月二十六日，太原纺织厂的无产阶级革命派夺权胜利了。红卫队和其他革命组织联合起来，同革命的领导干部一起，组成革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，掌握了全厂的一切大权。解悦被广大革命职工推选为太原纺织厂革命委员会副主任。她还是山西省革命委员会常委、太原市革命委员会委员。解悦在激烈的阶级搏斗中锻炼成长了。她从一位普通纺织女工，成为一位革命和生产的领导者，肩上挑起了更重的担子。
    解悦面临着一个新的形势，需要做出新的抉择了：要不要回到生产岗位上去？她牢牢记住毛主席要求干部参加生产领导生产的指示，记住毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，记住毛主席关于密切联系群众的教导，毅然决然地决定：回到车间去。
    早在三月十三日，她就和陈永贵、李顺达一起，决定撤销由他们领导的山西革命造反联络总站，号召战友们打回老家去，就地闹革命。
    三月二十四日，在太纺红卫队成立七个月纪念日，她又和队部所有负责人写了决心书，宣布立即返回生产岗位和工作岗位。
    这一天，他们一起学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示，学习了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》。大家认为，毛主席、党中央要求“工人组织中的工作人员，一般都不要脱离生产”，号召工人阶级挑好革命、生产两副重担，“成为现阶段全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范”，无产阶级革命派应当不折不扣地按照这些指示去办。
    他们还一起分析了厂里革命和生产的形势：在山西省军区派来的毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，经过两个月的艰苦斗争，已经把厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派基本上斗倒斗垮斗臭了，受这一小撮坏家伙操纵的
  “太纺红卫兵”已经土崩瓦解，受蒙蔽的群众绝大部分已经觉悟过来，“三结合”的革命委员会已经成立，全厂已经建立起革命和生产的良好秩序，生产出现了新高潮。在这种情况下，革命群众组织的负责人，必须把工作重点放在生产第一线，深入群众，带头活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，彻底挖掉企业中的修正主义根子，逐步把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    解悦和她所在红卫队队部的战友们，带着这样的新的战斗任务，回到了生产和工作第一线。
    休息时间，解悦和小组的战友们，亲密地围坐在纺纱机旁学习毛主席语录。小组长代表大家欢迎解悦，特意选读了一条语录：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。……享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”这是大家对解悦的赞扬和期望。
    半个月过去了，解悦没有辜负战友们的期望，十分认真地挑起抓革命促生产的重担。她始终把革命放在首位，和战友们一起活学活用毛主席著作，开展批评和自我批评，促进人的思想革命化。她充分利用业余时间和厂里为她安排的必要的工作时间，担负厂里革命委员会的工作。她经常把群众中的意见带上去，又把领导的意见带下来，不断地密切领导和群众的关系。　　本报记者
