The Chinese people are outraged by the latest crimes of U.S. imperialism

The Chinese people are extremely indignant over the latest crimes of U.S. imperialism, which recently in the open sea destroyed the peaceful labor of our fishermen by deliberately ramming and shooting at our fishing boats.

According to a report from fishermen who witnessed the U.S. pirate warships' atrocities and returned, on March 14, our fishing boat No. 2 from the Qunxing Brigade of the Xinying Commune in Danzhou County, Hainan Island, was operating in the open sea west of Hainan Island. More than ten U.S. aircraft carriers and other warships repeatedly harassed and disrupted our fishermen's production nearby. At 19:30, the U.S. aircraft carrier, disregarding the signal lights sent by our fishermen, deliberately sped up and rammed our No. 2 fishing boat. Instantly, the mast of our fishing boat was cut off, and the hull was damaged, causing our fishermen to fall into the sea. Our heroic fishermen shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" as they fell into the water. Following this, the aircraft carrier dispatched more than twenty fighter jets to provoke our fishermen.

On March 15, the No. 9 fishing boat from the Nanshan Brigade of the same commune was fishing in the same sea area. The U.S. again dispatched multiple military aircraft to provoke our fishing boat, with one aircraft even firing at our No. 9 fishing boat.

In recent periods, the Johnson administration, disregarding the repeated warnings of the great Chinese people, has continuously sent warships and military aircraft to intrude into our territorial waters and airspace, ramming and sinking our fishing boats, and killing and injuring our fishermen. This is not an isolated incident. It is clear that the U.S. imperialism's serious military provocations against our country occur at a time when its "war" and "peace" strategies in the Vietnam War have both failed, and it is cornered and desperate; it occurs at a time when its Guam war conference is taking place, and the Vietnam War is being escalated; it occurs at a time when it has deployed B-52 bombers to Thailand and is plotting new military adventures in Southeast Asia. The U.S. imperialism's series of military provocations against our country are obviously related to its aforementioned plots.

Regarding this, a responsible person from our relevant department pointed out, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'U.S. imperialism is rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world, making itself more and more isolated. The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of U.S. imperialism cannot frighten all those who do not want to be slaves. The surging tide of the people of the world opposing the U.S. aggressors is irresistible.' We must sternly warn the U.S. aggressors that the great Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not afraid of any enemy. The Chinese people have long seen through your weak essence and are fully prepared. Your provocations against the Chinese people will absolutely not end well!"

    美国强盗军舰、飞机在公海上撞坏扫射我渔船
    我国人民对美帝新罪行表示极大愤慨
    美帝对中国人民的挑衅，绝对不会有好下场
    据新华社六日讯　本社记者今天从我国有关部门获悉，美国强盗军舰最近又在公海上破坏我渔民的和平劳动，蓄意撞坏和扫射我渔船。美帝国主义这一新的严重罪行，激起了中国人民极大的愤慨。
    据目击美国强盗军舰行凶的我受害渔民归来报告，三月十四日，我海南岛儋县新英公社群星大队二号渔船在海南岛以西公海上作业时，美国航空母舰和其他军舰十多艘一再在附近骚扰，破坏我渔民生产。十九时三十分，美国航空母舰竟不顾我渔民用火光发出的讯号，公然加速向我二号渔船撞来，顿时把我渔船桅杆切断，把船身撞坏，使我渔民落海。我英雄的渔民落水时高呼：毛主席万岁！接着，这艘航空母舰又出动二十多架战斗机，向我渔民挑衅。
    三月十五日，该公社南岸大队九号渔船在同一海域捕鱼，美国又出动军用飞机多架对我渔船进行挑衅，其中一架并向我九号渔船扫射。
    最近一个时期，美国约翰逊政府不顾伟大中国人民的一再警告，接二连三地派遣军舰和军用飞机侵入我领海领空，撞坏撞沉我渔船，打死打伤我渔民，这绝不是孤立的事件。人们已经看到，美帝国主义对我国上述的严重军事挑衅，正是发生在它在侵越战争中的战“和”两手均告失败，狗急跳墙的时候；发生在它的关岛战争会议前后，侵越战争接连“升级”的时候；发生在它把B—52轰炸机调驻泰国，并阴谋在东南亚进行新的军事冒险的时候。美帝国主义对我国这一系列的军事挑衅，显然与它的上述阴谋密切相关。
    对此，我有关部门负责人指出，毛主席教导我们：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。”必须严正警告美国侵略者，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，是任何敌人吓不倒的。中国人民早已看穿了你们虚弱的本质，并且做好了一切准备。你们对中国人民的挑衅，是绝对不会有好下场的！
