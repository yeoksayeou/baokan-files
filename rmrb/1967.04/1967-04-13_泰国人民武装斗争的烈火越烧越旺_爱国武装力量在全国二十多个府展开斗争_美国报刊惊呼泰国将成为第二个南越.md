The armed struggle of the Thai people against American imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Baobang sellout clique, is rapidly spreading like wildfire. Currently, the sparks of people's armed struggle have spread across more than twenty provinces in the northeast, south, central, and north of Thailand. Despite repeated military "sweeps" by the Thai reactionary government, the armed struggle continues to grow. The head of the Thai reactionary government, Thanom, admits that even with a "powerful security force," it is difficult to suppress the people's armed forces. American newspapers are alarmed, warning that if the situation continues, Thailand will become a second South Vietnam.

The Thai people began their armed struggle as early as 1961. On January 1, 1965, the patriotic forces of Thailand formed the Thai Patriotic Front, calling on the Thai people to launch a widespread armed struggle against the bloodthirsty rule of the U.S. and the Thanom-Baobang sellout clique. Since then, the armed struggle of the Thai people has entered a new stage. By September 1965, the armed struggle had spread from the northeast to the central region, just 60 miles from Bangkok. By November 1965, people's armed forces had emerged in the northeast, south, north, and central regions of Thailand. In the northeast, provinces such as Nakhon Phanom, Sakhon Nakhon, Ubon, and Udon established bases for the people's armed forces. Close links were established between various guerrilla armed regions.

Last year, under the leadership of the Thai Patriotic Front, the armed struggle of the Thai people made significant progress. The armed forces of the Thai people organized many propaganda teams to go among the people, raise their political consciousness, and mobilize the broad masses to support and participate in the armed struggle. According to incomplete statistics, since January 24 of this year, propaganda teams of the people's armed forces have conducted 30 anti-American, pro-national resistance propaganda activities in rural areas controlled by the Thanom-Baobang clique over the past two months, receiving a warm welcome from the farmers. Even in some villages and towns that have been strictly controlled by the Thai reactionary military and police for many years, large numbers of young people have joined the people's armed forces. At the same time, the people's armed forces actively carried out the task of eliminating traitors, executing a large number of spies and local reactionary officials of the Thai reactionary government, thereby greatly weakening the foundation of the reactionary government's rule.

These activities of the people's armed forces have created the necessary conditions for expanding the people's armed struggle and defeating the reactionary military and police "sweeps." According to reports from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, in the past year, the armed forces of the Thai people fought more than 150 battles with the military and police of the Thanom-Baobang clique. In just over two months, from the beginning of this year to March 5, they fought 69 battles, of which the main forces of the Thai people's armed forces attacked enemy strongholds 18 times. The Thai people's armed forces, which have grown and strengthened in the struggle, have shown an invincible vitality.

The armed struggle of the Thai people is an important part of the struggle of the peoples of Southeast Asia against American aggression. For many years, the Thai reactionary ruling clique has repeatedly sold out national sovereignty and national interests and willingly served as a running dog of U.S. aggression in Asia. The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Fulbright, has openly called Thailand a "colony" and the "fifty-first state" of the United States. While expanding the war in Vietnam, the U.S. has also intensified its aggression and control over Thailand. The number of U.S. troops stationed in Thailand increased threefold last year to 36,000, and the number of military aircraft reached 410. The U.S. has built eight air bases in Thailand, 28 frequently used military airfields, 11 ground force bases, four missile bases, two radar stations, 10 naval bases and stations, and a strategic road network covering the entire country. Recently, the U.S. has also deployed B-52 strategic bombers in Thailand. Thus, Thailand has become an important base for the U.S. to bomb Vietnam, invade Laos, threaten Southeast Asia, and threaten China.

These aggressive actions by U.S. imperialism have enraged the broad masses of the Thai people. The Thai Patriotic Front, holding high the banner of resistance to American aggression and national salvation, first launched an armed uprising in the northeast, where U.S. military bases are concentrated. The national anti-American, pro-national resistance armed struggle has rapidly developed along with the U.S. expansion of aggression in Southeast Asia.

The U.S. and the Thanom-Baobang clique are terrified of the armed struggle of the Thai people. As early as last July, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk raved madly, calling for learning from the lessons in Vietnam to "take swift action" to "strangle the armed struggle of the Thai people in its infancy." Under this guideline, the Thanom-Baobang clique has repeatedly dispatched military and police to conduct "sweeps." The Thai reactionary forces have established a large number of armed spy units—"village defense teams"—and driven the people into pseudo-concentration camps—"self-reliant villages." U.S. military "advisors" command the Thai reactionary military and police, and U.S. military aircraft and "special forces" also directly participate in the "sweeps." At the same time, the U.S. has provided the Thai reactionary government with a large amount of military, economic, and technological "aid." U.S. newspapers admit that most of this "aid" is directly used for so-called "counter-insurgency activities." However, the desperate struggles of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries have not achieved their intended goals. The armed forces of the Thai people have not only not been strangled but have rapidly grown and strengthened in the struggle.

In the fierce and sharp armed struggle, the political consciousness of the Thai people is rapidly rising. With the strong support of the broad masses of the Thai people, the armed struggle of the Thai people is advancing in great strides. Through a long, arduous, and tortuous struggle, the Thai people will surely drive the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs into the sea and will definitely build a new, independent, free, and prosperous Thailand.

    泰国人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺
    爱国武装力量在全国二十多个府展开斗争　美国报刊惊呼泰国将成为第二个南越
    本报综合报道　泰国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团的武装斗争，正以燎原之势迅速发展。目前，人民武装斗争星星之火，已经燃遍了泰国东北部、南部、中部和北部的二十多个府。美泰反动当局虽然一再出兵“扫荡”，但是都无法抑制武装斗争发展。泰国反动政府头子他侬承认，即使有“强大的治安部队”，也很难把人民武装“镇压下去”。美国报刊惊呼：局势发展下去，泰国势将成为第二个南越。
    泰国人民早在一九六一年即开始了武装斗争。一九六五年一月一日，泰国爱国力量组成了泰国爱国阵线，号召泰国人民展开广泛武装斗争，反对美帝和他侬—巴博卖国集团的血腥统治。从此泰国人民的武装斗争进入了一个新的阶段。到一九六五年九月间，武装斗争已由东北部发展到离曼谷六十英里的中部地区。到一九六五年十一月间，泰国东北部、南部、北部和中部，都出现了人民武装力量，东北地区的那空拍侬、沙空那空、乌汶、乌隆等府，人民武装相继建立了根据地。各个游击武装地区之间建立了密切联系。
    去年，泰国人民武装斗争，在泰国爱国阵线领导下，又取得了重大的发展。泰国人民武装部队组织了许多武装宣传队到人民群众中进行宣传工作，提高人民群众思想觉悟，动员和组织了广大人民支持和参加武装斗争。据不完全统计，从今年一月二十四日开始的两个月中，人民武装宣传队进入他侬—巴博集团统治的农村中进行了三十次抗美救国斗争宣传，受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎。即使在一些多年来一直由美泰反动军警严密控制的村镇，也有大批青年参加了人民武装部队。与此同时，人民武装积极开展了除奸工作，处决了美泰反动政权的大批特务、基层反动官员，这就大大削弱了反动政权的统治基础。
    人民武装的这些活动，为扩大人民武装斗争，击败反动军警的“扫荡”，创造了必要的条件。据“泰国人民之声”电台报道，去年一年，泰国人民武装同他侬—巴博集团军警进行了一百五十多次战斗，而今年到三月五日止仅仅两个多月里，就进行了六十九次战斗，其中，泰国人民武装主力袭击敌人的据点达十八次。在斗争中成长壮大的泰国人民武装，显示了不可战胜的生命力。
    泰国人民的武装斗争是东南亚人民反对美国侵略斗争的一个重要组成部分。多年以来，泰国反动统治集团不断出卖国家主权和民族利益，甘心充当美帝侵略亚洲的走狗。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特早就直言不讳地将泰国说成是美国的“殖民地”和“第五十一个州”。美帝在不断扩大侵越战争的同时，也加紧了对泰国的侵略和控制。美国驻在泰国的军队，在去年一年内就增加了三倍，达到三万六千多人，军用飞机达四百一十架。美国在泰国修建了八个空军基地，经常使用的军用机场二十八个、地面部队基地十一个、导弹基地四个、雷达站两个、海军基地和驻地十个。战略公路网密布全国。最近，美国又将B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国。这样，泰国就成了美国轰炸越南、侵略老挝、威胁东南亚和威胁中国的重要基地。
    美帝国主义的这些侵略活动，激怒了广大泰国人民。泰国爱国阵线高举抗美救国大旗，首先在美帝军事基地集中的东北地区发动武装起义。全国的反美救国武装斗争，随着美帝扩大对东南亚的侵略活动，迅速发展起来。
    美国和他侬—巴博集团对泰国人民武装斗争怕得要死。早在去年七月，美国国务卿腊斯克就疯狂叫嚣，要吸取在越南的教训，“迅速采取行动”，把泰国人民武装斗争“扼杀于幼年时期”。在这个方针指导下，他侬—巴博集团不断出动军警，进行“扫荡”。美泰反动派建立了大批特务武装部队——“乡村保安队”，并把群众驱入变相的集中营——“自立村”。美国的军事“顾问”指挥泰国反动军警，美国军用飞机和“特种部队”也直接参加“扫荡”。同时，美国向泰国反动当局提供了大批军事、经济和技术“援助”。美国报纸供认，这些“援助”中绝大部分都直接用于所谓“反叛乱活动”。但是，美泰反动派的疯狂挣扎，都未达到他们所预期的目的。泰国人民武装不仅没有被扼杀，而且在斗争中迅速成长壮大起来。
    在激烈尖锐的武装斗争中，泰国人民的觉悟正在迅速提高。泰国人民武装斗争，在广大泰国人民的有力支持下，正在阔步前进。经过长期、艰苦和曲折的斗争，泰国人民必将把美国侵略势力和它的走狗扫进大海，一定会打出一个独立、自由、繁荣的新泰国。
