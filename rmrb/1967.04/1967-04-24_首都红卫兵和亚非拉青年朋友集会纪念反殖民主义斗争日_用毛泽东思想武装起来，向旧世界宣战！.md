Capital revolutionary youth and Red Guards held a grand meeting today to commemorate April 24th Anti-Colonial Struggle Day. The meeting expressed that Chinese youth, students, and Red Guards resolutely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the people, youth, and students of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world in their revolutionary struggles against U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism, and against modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party and reactionaries in various countries, and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Youth friends from thirteen Asian, African, and Latin American countries present in Beijing participated in today's meeting.

Representatives from the Capital Higher Education Red Guards, Capital Middle School Red Guards, National Youth Federation, and National Student Federation spoke at the meeting, first expressing their respect to the heroic Vietnamese people, youth, and students who are at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, and extending warm congratulations to the youth and students of various countries who have found the revolutionary truth and powerful weapon—the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought—in their struggles. They praised the daring spirit of struggle and revolutionary rebellion of the youth and students of various countries, who dare to fight and dare to win, and declare war on the old world.

He praised the brave struggle of Vietnamese youth and students, condemned U.S. imperialism's "escalation of the war" and "peace talks" deception in Vietnam, and condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's role as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said, the facts show that to oppose U.S.-led imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership.

He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao in our country has achieved great victories. This revolution is to uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our descendants will never change and remain revolutionary forever. This is a great innovation in the international communist movement, a revolution of the greatest practical significance to the contemporary world revolution, and a major development of Marxism-Leninism by Comrade Mao Zedong. He said, Chinese youth, students, and Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, care about state affairs, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, better fulfill our proletarian internationalist duties, and strive to build a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation.

Lê Sông Sơn, a member of the Permanent Representative Team of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Indonesian friend Suar Suroso, Dahomey friend Dizan, Bolivian friend Manuel Linares, and Japanese friend Yokozawa Shin also spoke at the meeting. They enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as the greatest leader of the contemporary world, the brightest red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism, the sole guiding ideology of the world revolution, and the beacon for the people of the world to strive for liberation. They said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being successfully carried out in China has shaken the entire world. It is related to the future and destiny of the world revolutionary movement. This revolution has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. This revolution makes China forever the invincible base of the world proletarian revolution. This revolution is a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary people of all countries to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Lê Sông Sơn introduced in his speech the struggles and glorious victories of the people and youth of South Vietnam under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Indonesian friend Suar Suroso said in his speech, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is not like inviting people to dinner, writing an essay, painting a picture, or embroidering flowers. It cannot be so gentle, so leisurely, so polite, so modest, and so yielding. Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another class." Only by mastering Chairman Mao's teachings can we young people avoid being corrupted by revisionism and lose our revolutionary spirit.

He said, Indonesian revolutionary youth will forever stand together with Chinese youth under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, and jointly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Dahomey youth friend Dizan said, African people are increasingly recognizing that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for African revolutionary people, the invincible force for Asian, African, and Latin American people to strive for liberation. He wished Chairman Mao eternal life and wished Mao Zedong Thought to spread throughout the world!

Bolivian youth Manuel Linares enthusiastically praised the people and youth of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for standing up, taking up arms, and resisting reactionary violence with the violence of the liberation struggle. He said, the people have understood the great truth expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." He pointed out that the flames of revolution have already been ignited in Latin America, and they will surely reduce the new colonialism concocted by imperialism to ashes. Latin America will surely achieve thorough liberation.

Japanese friend Yokozawa Shin first expressed his sincere wishes for the eternal life of the brightest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, and for the good health of Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, who has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He talked about the situation of Japanese people and youth striving to master Mao Zedong Thought, saying that Japanese revolutionary people sincerely love Chairman Mao, recognizing that only Mao Zedong Thought is their weapon for liberation.

    首都红卫兵和亚非拉青年朋友集会纪念反殖民主义斗争日
    用毛泽东思想武装起来，向旧世界宣战！
    据新华社二十二日讯  首都革命青年、红卫兵，今天隆重举行“四·二四”反殖民主义斗争日纪念大会。大会表示，中国青年、学生和红卫兵坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及世界各国人民、青年和学生反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命斗争，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    在北京的来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲十三个国家的青年朋友，参加了今天的大会。
    首都大专院校红代会、首都中学红代会、全国青联、全国学联代表在大会上首先讲话，向站在反美斗争最前线的英雄的越南人民、青年和学生，向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民、青年和学生致以敬意，热烈祝贺各国青年学生在斗争中找到了革命的真理和强大武器——伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，以敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏精神和革命造反气概，向旧世界宣战。
    他在讲话中赞扬越南青年和学生的英勇斗争，谴责美帝国主义在越南实行“战争升级”和玩弄“和谈”骗局，谴责苏修领导集团充当美帝帮凶，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的革命烈火。他说，事实说明，要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就必须反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    他说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大胜利，这场革命就是要挖掉修正主义根子，避免资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，使我们子孙万代永不变质，永远革命。这是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举，这是对于当代世界革命具有最重大现实意义的革命，这是毛泽东同志对马列主义的重大发展。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年、学生和红卫兵，是无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人。我们一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，将更好地履行自己的无产阶级国际主义义务，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团员黎松山、印度尼西亚朋友苏阿尔·苏罗梭、达荷美朋友迪扎尼、玻利维亚朋友玛努埃尔·利那雷斯、日本朋友横川伸，也在大会上讲话。他们热烈称颂毛主席是当代世界最伟大的领袖，是世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器，毛泽东思想是世界革命的唯一指导思想，是世界人民争取解放的指针。他们说，中国正在胜利进行的无产阶级文化大革命，震撼了整个世界，它关系着世界革命运动的前途和命运，这场革命沉重地打击了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派。这场革命，使中国永远成为战无不胜的世界无产阶级革命的根据地。这场革命对世界各国革命人民击败帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派是巨大的支持和鼓舞。
    黎松山在讲话中，介绍了越南南方人民和青年在越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜下，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行的斗争和所取得的辉煌胜利。
    印度尼西亚朋友苏阿尔·苏罗梭在讲话中说，毛主席教导我们：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”我们青年人只有掌握了毛主席的这些教导，才能使我们免遭损害青年一代革命精神的修正主义的侵蚀。
    他说，印尼革命青年将永远和在伟大的中国共产党领导下的中国青年团结在一起，共同高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    达荷美青年朋友迪扎尼说，我们非洲人民愈来愈认识到毛泽东思想是非洲革命人民的指针，是亚非拉人民争取解放的战无不胜的力量。他祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿毛泽东思想传遍全球！
    玻利维亚青年玛努埃尔·利那雷斯在讲话中热烈赞扬亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民和青年挺身而起，拿起武器，以解放斗争的暴力反抗反动的暴力。他说，人民已经懂得毛泽东同志所阐述的伟大真理：即“枪杆子里面出政权”。他指出，革命烈火已在拉丁美洲燃起，它必将把帝国主义炮制的新殖民主义烧成灰烬，拉丁美洲必将获得彻底解放。
    日本朋友横川伸在讲话中首先表示衷心敬祝世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，祝愿毛主席的最亲密战友、一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志身体健康。他谈到了日本人民和青年努力掌握毛泽东思想的情况，他说，日本革命人民衷心热爱毛主席，他们认识到只有毛泽东思想才是自己争取解放的武器。
