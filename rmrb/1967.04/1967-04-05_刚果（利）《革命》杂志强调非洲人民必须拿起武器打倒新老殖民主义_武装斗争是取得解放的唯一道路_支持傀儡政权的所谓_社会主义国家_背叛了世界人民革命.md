The Revolutionary Magazine of Congo (Leopoldville) emphasizes that the African people must take up arms to overthrow new and old colonialism. Armed struggle is the only path to liberation. The so-called "socialist" countries that support puppet regimes have betrayed the world revolution.

New China News Agency, April 4th: The January issue of "Revolution," the official publication of the National Liberation Committee of Congo (Leopoldville), features an article titled "Armed Struggle in Africa: The Correct Path." The article states unequivocally that armed struggle against international imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys is the only path to true independence for the African people. The article points out that armed struggle is also the only correct path to prevent new colonialism from infiltrating Africa.

The article condemns the evil plots of the number one enemy of the African people, American imperialism, in staging reactionary coups in Africa. It also points out that these plots are encouraged and supported by some so-called "socialist" countries. The article states that the African people must use revolutionary violence to counter reactionary violence, in other words, take up arms to overthrow new and old colonialism. The article says, "The people taking up arms against colonialism returning to the continent in a new guise is, of course, what is called a just war." The article states: "The armed struggle of the revolutionary people of Congo (Leopoldville) is the highest means of saving Congo (Leopoldville). For the people of countries where colonialists have only superficially laid down their arms, armed struggle is the most suitable. In this way, they will definitely find the best solution for the future of their country and their descendants. They cannot be passive and indifferent when foreign monopolies exploit their wealth."

The article states, "The armed struggle of the peoples of various African countries against new and old colonialism and imperialism is part of the world revolutionary process. This struggle is the same as the struggle of the peoples of Asia and Latin America against American imperialism." The article further emphasizes that therefore, any so-called "socialist" countries that support puppet regimes in areas where there is patriotic armed struggle are betraying the world revolution.

The article concludes: In the persistent armed struggle, the oppressed peoples of various African countries will establish a broad united front against imperialism and its lackeys across the entire continent.

    刚果（利）《革命》杂志强调非洲人民必须拿起武器打倒新老殖民主义
    武装斗争是取得解放的唯一道路
    支持傀儡政权的所谓“社会主义国家”背叛了世界人民革命
    新华社四日讯　刚果（利）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》一月号刊载一篇题为《非洲的武装斗争：正确的道路》的文章说，毫无疑问，反对以美国为首的国际帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，是非洲人民取得真正独立的唯一道路。文章指出，武装斗争也是阻止新殖民主义插足非洲的唯一正确的道路。
    文章谴责非洲人民的头号敌人美帝国主义在非洲搞反动政变的罪恶阴谋，并且指出，这些阴谋得到一些所谓“社会主义国家”的鼓励和支持。文章说，非洲人民不得不用革命的暴力来反对反动的暴力，就是说，拿起武器打倒新老殖民主义。文章说，“人民拿起武器来反对披着新的外衣的殖民主义返回大陆，当然这就是人们所说的正义战争。”文章说：“刚果（利）革命人民的武装斗争是拯救刚果（利）的最高手段。对于那些殖民主义者只是在表面上放下武器的国家的人民来说，武装斗争对他们是最适合的，这样他们就一定能够为他们国家和他们后代的美好前途找到最好的解决办法。对于外国垄断资本剥削他们财富，他们不能消极被动，无动于衷。”
    文章说，“非洲各国人民同新老殖民主义和帝国主义所进行的武装斗争，是世界革命进程的一部分。这个斗争同亚洲和拉丁美洲人民所进行的反对美帝国主义的斗争一样。”文章接着强调指出，因此凡是支持那些存在爱国武装斗争的地区的傀儡政权的那些所谓“社会主义国家”，就是背叛了世界人民的革命。
    文章最后说：非洲受剥削的各国人民在坚持武装斗争中，将在整个大陆建立起一个广泛的反对帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线。
