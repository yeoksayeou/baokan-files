    From April 7th to 8th, most parts of Hebei Province experienced rainfall. The rainfall in the western part of the Shengzhou District, the western part of the Cangzhou District, and the eastern parts of the Baoding, Xingtai, and Handan Districts ranged from 5 to 12 millimeters.

    From April 2nd to 3rd, most parts of Hebei Province had already received a round of rain. The southeastern part of the Chengde District to the eastern part of the Tangshan District saw rainfall amounts of 20 to 25 millimeters. The Hengshui, Xingtai, and Handan Districts, most of the Tianjin District, the northwestern part of the Cangzhou District, and the southeastern parts of the Baoding and Shijiazhuang Districts generally received over 5 millimeters, with some counties and cities reaching around 10 millimeters.

    These two rounds of rainfall have resulted in significant precipitation in the central and southern plains of Hebei Province, as well as parts of the Tangshan and Chengde Districts. This is beneficial for the upcoming spring plowing and sowing, as well as the growth of wheat.
