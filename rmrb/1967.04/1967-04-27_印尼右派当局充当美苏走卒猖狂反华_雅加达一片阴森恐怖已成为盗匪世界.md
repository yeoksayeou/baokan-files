The right-wing military regime of Suharto-Nasution, which serves as the lackeys of American imperialism in Indonesia, has, in the past few days, orchestrated a series of horrifying anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese-Indonesian racist atrocities in Jakarta, and deliberately attempted to completely sabotage the relations between China and Indonesia, turning Jakarta into a city shrouded in a grim atmosphere of terror and banditry.

The new wave of brazen anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese-Indonesian racism instigated by the Indonesian reactionaries began with the brutal murder of the Chinese-Indonesian Ning Xiangyu and the violent attack on the Chinese-Indonesians who were attending his funeral. On April 20, the broad masses of patriotic Chinese-Indonesians in Jakarta, filled with indignation, participated in the funeral procession for Ning Xiangyu. Despite the attacks and bloody suppression by right-wing armed military police and thugs, they persisted for over four hours to reach the cemetery. However, the Indonesian reactionaries, terrified by this orderly mass action, launched a frenzied attack on this pre-approved funeral, inciting a large number of thugs to commit a series of inhuman anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese-Indonesian racist atrocities from April 22 onwards.

Even some Western news agencies' reports from Jakarta revealed the right-wing thugs and military police's shocking racist atrocities of burning, smashing, looting, beating, and killing Chinese-Indonesians, describing them as "purely racist attacks" regardless of what the Indonesian right-wing government says. From April 22 to 25, thousands of thugs repeatedly stormed into areas where Chinese-Indonesians reside in Jakarta. They frenziedly ransacked and looted shops, beat up Chinese-Indonesians, and destroyed vehicles and everything in sight. After the thugs' rampage, the right-wing military continued to "inspect and search Chinese shops and residences." After multiple raids by right-wing thugs and military police, many Chinese-Indonesian shops were forced to close, and the streets were deserted.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities dispatched hundreds of thugs to surround the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta on April 22, shouting anti-Chinese slogans and throwing stones at the embassy, deliberately provoking a confrontation. The large number of military police on the scene not only failed to stop them but also colluded and encouraged them. The Chinese Embassy had repeatedly called the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and police authorities, demanding that they immediately take measures to drive away the thugs, withdraw the military police, and ensure the safety of the embassy and its personnel. However, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and police authorities not only ignored the Chinese Embassy's legitimate demands but absurdly proposed to lead a so-called "delegation" of thugs into the Chinese Embassy to present their anti-Chinese "resolutions."

On April 23, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of military police to continue surrounding the Chinese Embassy. The streets around the embassy were filled with military police, and security was tight. When Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, was on his way to meet with the Director of the Asia-Pacific Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Subazo, at 5:40 PM, right-wing armed military personnel forcibly boarded the car, abducting Xu Ren to a military district command in Jakarta. After repeated protests from the Chinese Embassy and Xu Ren to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and military district commanders, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities, cornered and out of arguments, were forced to escort Xu Ren back to the Chinese Embassy.

On April 24, to evade responsibility for its brutal persecution of Chinese-Indonesians, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary government, after organizing armed military police and thugs to attack and surround the Chinese Embassy and abduct Chinese consular officials, fabricated excuses and arbitrarily declared that the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and the Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, were "unwelcome persons," ordering them to leave the country within a specified period. However, this new outrage by the Indonesian reactionaries cannot cover up their heinous anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese-Indonesian racist crimes; it only further exposes their malicious plot to completely sabotage the relations between the two countries.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The reactionaries always have their plans, which are about how to harm others for their own benefit and how to play both sides. However, all past reactionaries have ended up with results opposite to their wishes. They always start by harming others and end up harming themselves." The right-wing military regime in Indonesia, which is frenziedly anti-communist and anti-people domestically, is now eagerly serving as the vanguard of American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership in their anti-Chinese campaigns, brazenly committing anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese-Indonesian racism. This can only further expose its fascist executioner's reactionary face and hasten its own doom.

### 印尼右派当局充当美苏走卒猖狂反华  雅加达一片阴森恐怖已成为盗匪世界

    印尼右派当局充当美苏走卒猖狂反华
    雅加达一片阴森恐怖已成为盗匪世界
    新华社二十六日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义在印尼的走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人政权，在最近几天中在雅加达制造了一系列骇人听闻的反华排华种族主义暴行，和蓄意彻底破坏中国印尼两国关系的严重事件，使雅加达成为笼罩着阴森恐怖气氛的盗匪城市。
    印尼反动派一手掀起的这场猖狂反华排华新浪潮，是从它制造了残杀华侨宁祥雨的惨案，和袭击为宁祥雨送葬的华侨的严重流血事件开始的。四月二十日，雅加达广大爱国华侨怀着满腔悲愤，参加了为宁祥雨送葬的行列，他们不顾右派武装军警和暴徒们的袭击和血腥镇压，坚持行进四个多小时到达了墓地。但是，被这次秩序井然的群众性行动吓破了胆的印尼反动派，竟然疯狂地攻击这次事先得到许可的葬礼，并且策动大批暴徒，从二十二日起灭绝人性地制造了一系列反华排华的种族主义暴行。
    甚至西方通讯社的一些从雅加达发出的报道，也透露了右派暴徒和军警对华侨大烧、大砸、大抢、大打、大杀的一些骇人听闻的种族主义暴行，认为“不论（印尼右派）政府怎样说，那种袭击纯粹是种族主义的。”在从二十二日到二十五日这几天中，成千的暴徒一再闯到雅加达华侨居住的地区。他们疯狂地捣毁和抢劫商店，殴打华侨，破坏车辆和看到的一切东西。在暴徒们行凶之后，右派军队又“继续检查和搜查华人商店和住宅”。经过右派暴徒和军警一再洗劫之后，许多华侨商店都被迫停止营业，街上行人稀少。
    与此同时，印尼右派反动当局又指使数百名暴徒，在二十二日包围了中国驻印尼大使馆，狂呼反华口号，并且向大使馆投掷石块，蓄意挑衅。在场的大批军警不但不加制止，反而包庇怂恿。中国大使馆曾经多次用电话通知印尼外交部和警察当局，严正要求他们立即采取措施，赶走暴徒，撤走军警，保证大使馆和使馆人员的安全。但是印尼外交部和警察当局不仅不理会中国大使馆的正当要求，竟然荒谬地提出要带领暴徒们的所谓“代表团”进入中国大使馆，要大使馆接受暴徒们的反华“决议”。
    二十三日，印尼右派反动当局派出的大批军警继续包围了中国大使馆，在大使馆周围的大街小巷也布满军警，戒备森严。当中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁应印尼外交部亚洲太平洋司司长苏巴佐之约，在下午五时四十分乘车前往会见苏巴佐时，右派武装军人竟然持枪强行登车，把徐仁总领事劫持到雅加达的一个军支区司令部。在中国大使馆和徐仁总领事向印尼外交部和军支区头目一再提出抗议后，印尼右派反动当局理屈词穷，才被迫护送徐仁总领事返回了中国大使馆。
    二十四日，印尼右派反动政府为了逃避它残酷迫害华侨的罪责，在组织武装军警和暴徒袭击包围中国大使馆、武装劫持中国领事官员的暴行遭到失败之后，又颠倒是非地捏造借口，悍然无理宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁为“不受欢迎的人”，限期勒令他们离境。但是，印尼反动派的这一新的倒行逆施，绝对掩盖不了它犯下的反华排华的种族主义的滔天罪行，只不过更加暴露了它的蓄意彻底破坏两国关系的恶毒阴谋。
    毛主席早就指出：“顽固派，他们总有一套计划，其计划是如何损人利己以及如何装两面派之类。但是从来的顽固派，所得的结果，总是和他们的愿望相反。他们总是以损人开始，以害己告终。”印尼右派军人政权在国内疯狂反共反人民，现在又卖力地为美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团充当反华先锋，猖狂地反华排华，只能更进一步暴露它的法西斯刽子手的反动面目，加速它自己的末日的到来。
