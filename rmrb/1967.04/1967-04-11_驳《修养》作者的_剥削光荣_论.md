Refuting the "Exploitation is Glorious" Argument of the Author of "Cultivation"

Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, Five-Good Soldier Zong Shilin

Upon hearing the number one capitalist-roader within the Party spout nonsense about how "the more a capitalist exploits, the greater his merit and the more glorious he is," I felt immense outrage. Isn't this blatantly singing praises for the bloodsucking capitalists and clearing the way for the restoration of capitalism?

Last year, while on a mission in the Dalian area, I visited the "Mass Grave of Ten Thousand." I saw with my own eyes the evidence of how capitalists cruelly exploited salt field workers before liberation. Before liberation, the capitalists of the Dalian salt fields, in order to gain high profits, deceived some poor people into working for them. Once the poor people entered the gates of the salt fields, they entered the gates of hell. Countless poor people worked from dawn till midnight, bleeding and sweating, living a life worse than cattle. A worker surnamed Liu, for not obeying the foreman's beatings, was pushed into a boiling salt pot and scalded to death. The workers, with their feet cracked and bleeding from the salt water, carried heavy salt baskets, running back and forth on the salt flats, leaving trails of blood. Many workers fell ill from overwork, gasping for breath. The heartless capitalists not only did not provide medical treatment but ordered the scabs to carry the sick into the "Mass Grave of Ten Thousand" to be fed to wild dogs. A worker surnamed Li, as he was being carried into the "Mass Grave of Ten Thousand" by the scabs, weakly shouted, "I am not dead, I can still live!"

Look, this is the "merit" and "glory" of the capitalists as described by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "These classes represent the most backward and most reactionary production relations in China, obstructing the development of China's productive forces. They are completely incompatible with the goals of the Chinese revolution. Especially the big landlord class and the big comprador class, they always stand on the side of imperialism and are extreme counter-revolutionaries." The nature of capitalists is to exploit and oppress the people. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party spreads these monstrous lies and shameless fabrications, all for the purpose of blurring class distinctions, preventing us from recognizing the struggle between the two roads, preventing us from opposing capitalist exploitation, and achieving his evil goal of restoring capitalism in China, letting millions of laboring people suffer. His intentions are so malicious!

Let me tell you, number one capitalist-roader within the Party, your schemes are in vain. The time to thoroughly settle accounts with your heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought has come. The great army of the proletarian cultural revolution, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has already made up its mind to resolutely fight you down and expose you.

    驳《修养》作者的“剥削光荣”论
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士　宗世林
    听到党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派胡说什么资本家“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣”，我感到万分气愤。这不是明目张胆地为吸血鬼资本家唱颂歌，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道吗！
    去年，我在旅大地区执行任务时，参观过“万人坑”，亲眼看到解放前资本家残酷剥削盐场工人的罪证。解放前，旅大盐场的资本家为了获得高额利润，花言巧语欺骗了一些穷人为他去做工。穷苦人民一走进盐场的大门，就是走进鬼门关。多少穷人在盐场里起五更睡半夜，流血流汗，过着牛马不如的生活。一位姓刘的工人，因不顺从工头的打骂，就被推进滚开的盐锅里烫死了。工人们整天赤着被盐水浸裂的双脚，抬着大盐筐，在盐滩上跑来跑去，留下斑斑血迹。不少工人积劳成疾，病得奄奄一息。狼心狗肺的资本家不但不给医治，反而叫工贼抬进“万人坑”喂野狗。一位姓李的工人，当工贼抬他进“万人坑”时，他有气无力地喊道：“我没有死，我还能活啊！”看吧，这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所说的资本家的“功劳”和“光荣”。
    毛主席教导我们：“这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展。他们和中国革命的目的完全不相容。特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”资本家的本性就是剥削人民，压榨人民的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派撒下这些弥天大谎，无耻谰言，无非是为了抹杀阶级界限，不让我们去认识两条道路的斗争，不让我们反对资本主义剥削，达到他在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，让千百万劳动人民人头落地，其用心何其毒也！
    告诉你，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，你的鬼算盘打错了。彻底清算你反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行的时刻到了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级文化革命大军，早已下定决心，坚决把你斗倒斗臭。
