The China-Japan Friendship Association held a reception today to warmly welcome Japanese proletarian revolutionary fighter Okada Haruko, who, despite various obstructions by Japanese Communist Party revisionists, has come to our country for a visit. Proletarian revolutionary fighter Okada Bunji, who came to China in 1941, participated in the struggle against Japanese imperialism's invasion of China in Yan'an and made contributions to the liberation cause of the Chinese people. He returned to Japan in 1945 and actively participated in the struggle for the liberation of the Japanese people until his death in 1966. Okada Haruko, following the wishes of her late husband Okada Bunji, has brought part of his ashes to China for burial.

At today's reception, Vice Chairman Zhao Yimin of the China-Japan Friendship Association spoke first. He said, Okada Bunji loved Chairman Mao, loved Mao Zedong Thought, loved New China, and persisted in the revolution. He opposed the Japanese Communist Party revisionists' betrayal of the Japanese people and their "joint actions" with Soviet revisionists. He opposed the Japanese Communist Party revisionists' anti-China and anti-Mao Zedong Thought stance. His revolutionary spirit has left a deep impression on us, and his internationalist spirit is worth learning from.

Zhao Yimin said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought. Okada Haruko has expressed her desire to inherit Okada Bunji's will, learn Mao Zedong Thought for the victory of the Japanese revolution, and fight alongside the Japanese revolutionary people against the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. We admire Okada Haruko's revolutionary spirit and firmly support her struggle.

Zhao Yimin said, Japanese Marxist-Leninists are the true reliance and hope of the Japanese people's revolution. In the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, the final victory will surely belong to the true Marxist-Leninists and the Japanese people. We firmly support the struggle of Japanese Marxist-Leninists and the Japanese people, and stand shoulder to shoulder with them to fight for the final victory of the world proletarian revolution.

Okada Haruko said in her speech, I am deeply moved to be able to come to Beijing, where the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, resides, and to have the opportunity to personally observe and experience the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. It is difficult to find the right words to express my feelings.

Okada Haruko denounced the Japanese Communist Party revisionists for following the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in slandering the great leader Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. She said, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists oppose Chairman Mao, oppose China, and deny the significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which means they deny the great cause of world revolution and prove that they have lost the soul of communists. She said, we absolutely cannot allow their slander and defamation.

Okada Haruko expressed her determination to inherit Okada Bunji's will, arm herself with Mao Zedong Thought, and carry on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle to the end. She concluded with the slogan, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    中日友协热烈欢迎日本反修战士冈田春子
    赵毅敏表示坚决支持冈田春子同日共修正主义分子进行的斗争
    冈田春子决心用毛泽东思想武装自己把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    据新华社二十八日讯  中日友好协会今天举行招待会，热烈欢迎日本无产阶级革命战士冈田文吉同志的夫人冈田春子同志，冲破日共修正主义分子的种种阻挠，来到我国进行访问。无产阶级革命战士冈田文吉同志，于一九四一年来到中国，在延安参加反对日本帝国主义侵略中国的斗争，对中国人民的解放事业作出了贡献。他一九四五年回国，积极参加日本人民争取解放的斗争，一直到他一九六六年逝世为止。冈田春子同志根据冈田文吉同志生前的愿望，这次把冈田文吉同志的部分骨灰带到中国来安葬。
    在今天的招待会上，对外友协副会长赵毅敏首先讲话。他说，冈田文吉同志热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱新中国，坚持革命。他反对日共修正主义分子背叛日本人民、同苏修搞“联合行动”，他反对日共修正主义分子反华、反毛泽东思想。他的革命精神给我们留下了深刻印象，他的国际主义精神是值得我们学习的。
    赵毅敏说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，就是要大灭资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。冈田春子同志表示要继承冈田文吉同志的遗志，为了日本革命的胜利，要学习毛泽东思想，要和日本革命人民一道，同日共修正主义分子进行斗争。我们钦佩冈田春子同志的这种革命精神，坚决支持冈田春子同志的斗争。
    赵毅敏说，日本的马克思列宁主义者，是日本人民革命的真正依靠和希望。在同美、日反动派和日共修正主义分子的斗争中，最后胜利一定属于日本的真正马克思列宁主义者和日本人民。我们坚决支持日本的马克思列宁主义者和日本人民的斗争，并同他们并肩战斗，为争取世界无产阶级革命的最后胜利而斗争。
    冈田春子在讲话中说，我能够来到世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席居住的北京，并且有机会亲眼观察、亲身体会由毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，我的心情非常激动，真是很难找到适当的语言来表达。
    冈田春子谴责日共修正主义分子跟随苏联修正主义统治集团诬蔑伟大领袖毛主席，诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命。她说，日共修正主义分子反对毛主席，反对中国，否定中国无产阶级文化大革命的意义，就是否定了实现世界革命的伟大事业，就是证明他们失去了共产主义者的灵魂。她说，对于他们的造谣诬蔑，我们是绝对不能允许的。
    冈田春子表示，她将不怕任何风险，决心继承冈田文吉同志的遗志，用毛泽东思想武装自己，把反帝反修斗争进行到底。她最后高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
