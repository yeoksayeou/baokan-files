Revolutionary comrades and fellow fighters!

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been officially established today. This is a great day for the revolutionary masses of Beijing, and it is also a great day for the revolutionary masses of the whole country. We, the delegation from the revolutionary committees of Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Shanghai, are honored to participate in this meeting. We represent the revolutionary committees and the revolutionary people of these five provinces and municipalities in extending our warmest congratulations to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and to the revolutionary comrades of Beijing. We salute you with the spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Comrades and fellow fighters, Beijing is where our great leader Chairman Mao resides. It is the capital of our great motherland and the center of our proletarian revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of Beijing, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, have been at the forefront of the battle. They have made special contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide and have achieved special merits. With the great revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, you have launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, achieving the first great victory in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. You posted the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country. You initiated the Red Guard movement that shook the world. You enthusiastically received more than ten million revolutionary youths who came to Beijing for revolutionary exchanges. You also sent tens of thousands of Red Guard fighters to various parts of the country, carrying Chairman Mao's directives to every corner of the country, spreading the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to make revolution, and joining forces with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat there to spread the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country. Every victory in the Cultural Revolution in our provinces and municipalities is inseparable from the full support of the revolutionary masses of Beijing and the heroic struggles of the Red Guard youths of the capital. Here, we once again express our heartfelt thanks to you, comrades and fellow fighters.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now at the height of the struggle for the revolutionary masses to unite and seize power. The great criticism of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is sweeping the country. At this crucial moment, the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide. We are deeply convinced that this temporary power organ, formed in the revolutionary struggle, representing the revolution, with proletarian revolutionary authority, will surely lead the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital to continue to be at the forefront of the nationwide Cultural Revolution, making even greater contributions to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution in Beijing and throughout the country. It will surely build our great capital into a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, never fading, and become a model for the whole country and an example for the world.

Comrades and fellow fighters, we are all soldiers of Chairman Mao, fighting in the same trench against the common enemy. During our stay in Beijing, we have learned many good experiences from you. Especially the new experiences you have created in the process of implementing revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and the new experiences of establishing workers' congresses, Red Guard congresses, and congresses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Today, we have also listened to Comrade Xie Fuzhi's report and the speeches of comrades from various aspects. We will continue to learn from you. You will also continue to help us as you have done in the past. Let us, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance shoulder to shoulder for the complete victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and for new victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    张春桥同志代表五省市革命委员会代表团的讲话
    新华社二十日讯　张春桥同志代表五省、市革命委员会代表团在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上的讲话革命的同志们，战友们！
    北京市革命委员会今天正式成立了。这是北京市无产阶级革命派的盛大节日，也是全国无产阶级革命派的盛大节日。我们，山西、贵州、黑龙江、山东和上海五个省市的革命委员会代表团，应邀参加这个大会，感到非常高兴。我们受这五个省市革命委员会和革命人民的委托，向北京市革命委员会，向北京市的革命战友们，表示最热烈的祝贺，向你们致无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    同志们，战友们，北京是我们伟大领袖毛主席居住的地方，是我们伟大祖国的首都，是我们无产阶级革命的中心。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，北京市的无产阶级革命派在以毛主席为首的党中央的直接领导下，走在战斗的最前列，对全国的无产阶级文化大革命作出了特殊的贡献，建立了特殊的功勋。你们以无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团发动猛烈进攻，取得了斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的第一个伟大胜利。你们贡献了全国第一张马列主义的大字报。你们发起了震撼世界的红卫兵运动。你们热情地接待了来北京串连的一千多万革命小将。你们还派出了成千成万的红卫兵战士到全国各地，把毛主席的号召带到全国各地，把敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命的作风带到全国各地，同那里的无产阶级革命派结合在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命的烈火烧遍全国。我们各省市文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是同北京无产阶级革命派的全力支援，同首都红卫兵小将们的英勇奋战分不开的。在这里，我们再一次向同志们、战友们表示衷心的感谢。
    我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正处在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的斗争高潮中。对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，正在全国兴起。在这个重要的时刻，北京市革命委员会的成立，对全国的无产阶级革命派是极大的鼓舞。我们深信，这个在革命斗争中形成的、革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级革命权威的临时权力机构，一定能够领导首都的无产阶级革命派，继续走在全国文化大革命的战斗前列，对夺取北京市和全国文化大革命的彻底胜利，作出更出色的贡献，一定能够把我们伟大的首都，建设成为活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，永不变色，成为全国的模范，世界的榜样。
    战友们，我们都是毛主席的战士，我们是在一条战壕里向共同的敌人作战。我们各省市代表团在北京期间，学习到了很多很好的经验。特别是你们实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”过程中所创造的新经验，你们建立工代会、红代会、贫下中农代表会的新经验。今天我们又听了谢富治同志的报告和各方面同志的讲话。我们将继续向你们学习。你们也一定会象过去一样继续帮助我们。让我们在毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，为以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的彻底胜利，为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新胜利，肩并肩地奋勇前进！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
