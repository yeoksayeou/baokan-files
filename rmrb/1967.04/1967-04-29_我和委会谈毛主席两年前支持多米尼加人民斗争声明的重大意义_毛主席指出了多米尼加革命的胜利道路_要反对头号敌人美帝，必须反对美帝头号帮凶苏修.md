To commemorate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement "Support the Dominican People's Struggle Against U.S. Armed Invasion," a responsible person of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement today. The full text is as follows:

The great teacher of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Comrade Mao Zedong, teaches us: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

In April 1965, the brave people of the Dominican Republic rose up in rebellion. The Dominican people, with great courage, took up arms to overthrow the traitorous dictatorial regime of the U.S. puppet, Balaguer, and fought face-to-face with the heavily armed giant, the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. This fact once again proves that Chairman Mao's profound judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is completely correct. On May 12, 1965, at a time when the struggle of the Dominican people against U.S. imperialism was at its most intense, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a solemn statement, giving the most timely and resolute support to the Dominican people's anti-imperialist patriotic struggle, pointing out the road and direction for the revolutionary struggle to achieve victory. This statement greatly boosted the morale of the Dominican people and the people of all countries, and crushed the arrogance of the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and all kinds of reactionaries. This statement expresses the unshakable will of the 700 million Chinese people to support the Dominican people.

When the U.S. aggressors encountered the resolute resistance of the Dominican people and the indignant condemnation of the revolutionary people of the world, the Soviet revisionists hurriedly raised the banner of so-called "ceasefire" and "peace talks," legalizing U.S. aggression. This is another great betrayal of the revolutionary people, fully exposing their true colors as great traitors, great accomplices, and great scabs. However, the aggression of the U.S. and the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists did not frighten or crush the heroic Dominican people. Over the past two years, the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Dominican people has been surging. The revolutionary faction of the Dominican Republic has come to realize from their own experience that to oppose the number one enemy, U.S. imperialism, they must also engage in uncompromising, unyielding struggle against the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism.

The Dominican people and the revolutionary faction have begun to recognize from their experience and lessons in the anti-U.S. struggle that only Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for struggle and victory; they have begun to recognize that only people's war is the sole path to national liberation. Currently, the revolutionary faction of the Dominican Republic is mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses, persevering in the struggle. The sparks of revolution are igniting in the countryside of the Dominican Republic. We believe that the flames of people's war will surely burn up the U.S. aggressors and their accomplices completely, thoroughly, and cleanly.

The revolutionary spirit of the Dominican people also inspires the Chinese people, who are undergoing an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. The 700 million Chinese people, tempered and tested by the cultural revolution, are fearless heroes who are not afraid of heaven, earth, ghosts, or gods. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are nothing to us. We will stand more firmly with the Dominican people and fight alongside the Dominican people, winning together.

We are full of confidence and hope for the anti-U.S. struggle of the Dominican people. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement "Support the Dominican People's Struggle Against U.S. Armed Invasion": "As long as they rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in long-term struggle, the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, with the support of the people of the world, is definitely able to achieve final victory."

The Dominican people will surely win, and the U.S. will surely be defeated!

    我和委会谈毛主席两年前支持多米尼加人民斗争声明的重大意义
    毛主席指出了多米尼加革命的胜利道路
    要反对头号敌人美帝，必须反对美帝头号帮凶苏修
    新华社二十八日讯　为纪念毛主席《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》发表二周年，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天发表谈话，全文如下：
    中国人民和全世界人民伟大的导师毛泽东同志教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”
    一九六五年四月，英勇的多米尼加人民起来造反了。多米尼加人民以大无畏的精神拿起枪杆，推翻了美帝在多米尼加的走狗——卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权，并且同武装到牙齿的庞然大物、全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义作了面对面的斗争，给了美帝以沉重的打击，这一事实又一次证明，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，是完全正确的。一九六五年五月十二日，在多米尼加人民同美帝国主义斗争正在尖锐激烈的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发表了严正声明，对多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争，给予了最及时、最坚决的支持，指明了革命斗争取得胜利的道路和方向。这一声明大长了多米尼加人民和世界各国人民的志气，灭尽了美帝、苏修和形形色色反动派的威风。这一声明表达了七亿中国人民支持多米尼加人民的坚定不移的意志。
    在美帝强盗侵略遭到多米尼加人民的坚决反击和世界革命人民的愤怒谴责时，苏修急急忙忙打起所谓“停火”“和谈”的破旗，使美帝侵略合法化。这是又一次对革命人民的大出卖，充分暴露了它的大叛徒、大帮凶、大工贼的真嘴脸。但是美帝的侵略、苏修的出卖吓不倒、压不垮英雄的多米尼加人民。近两年来，多米尼加人民反美爱国的斗争此起彼伏。多米尼加的革命派从亲身的经历中认识到，要反对头号敌人美帝国主义，就必须同时与美帝头号帮凶苏联修正主义作不调和、不妥协的斗争。
    多米尼加人民及革命派从反美斗争的经验和教训中，已开始认识到只有毛泽东思想才是进行斗争和取得胜利的强大的思想武器；开始认识到只有人民战争，才是求得民族解放的唯一途径。目前，多米尼加革命派正在发动群众、组织群众、武装群众，坚持斗争。革命的星星之火正在多米尼加农村点燃。我们相信，人民战争的燎原烈火，必将把美国侵略者及其帮凶全部、干净、彻底地烧光。
    多米尼加人民的革命精神，也鼓舞着正在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下进行着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民。经过文化大革命锻炼和考验的七亿中国人民，更是天不怕、地不怕、鬼不怕、神不怕的英雄汉，美帝、苏修都不在话下。我们将更坚定不移地站在多米尼加人民一边和多米尼加人民战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们对多米尼加人民的反美斗争满怀信心和希望。正如毛主席在《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》中所指出的：“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”
    多米尼加人民必胜，美帝必败！
