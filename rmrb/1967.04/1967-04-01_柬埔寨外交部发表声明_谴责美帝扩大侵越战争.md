According to a report from the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 30th, the Cambodian News Agency reported that the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 30th, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism's further escalation of the war in Vietnam.

The statement said: "Recently, the U.S. imperialists have been accelerating their aggression against the Vietnamese people.

	"The U.S. imperialists, following their barbaric bombing of Hanoi, with the help of their lackeys, have taken a new step in escalating the war, that is: the U.S. imperialists' artillery stationed south of the demilitarized zone have shelled the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, warships of the Seventh Fleet have systematically shelled coastal areas, and mines have been laid in rivers in northern Vietnam."

The statement said: "The Royal Government and people of the Kingdom of Cambodia—who are also victims of the U.S. policy of stubborn aggression in Southeast Asia—fully support the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 1, 1967, and extend warm greetings to the heroic Vietnamese people in their valiant struggle for national liberation."

    柬埔寨外交部发表声明
    谴责美帝扩大侵越战争
    据新华社金边三十日电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨王国政府外交部三十日发表声明，最强烈地谴责美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争的罪行。
    声明说：“最近，美帝国主义者以日益加快的速度加强了他们对越南人民的侵略战争。
      “美帝国主义者继野蛮轰炸河内之后，在其仆从的帮助下，又迈出了战争升级的新的步子，那就是：美帝国主义者设在非军事区以南的地面大炮轰击越南民主共和国领土，第七舰队的军舰有计划地炮轰沿海地区，在越南北方河流中投放水雷。”
    声明说：“柬埔寨王国政府和人民——也是美国在东南亚奉行的顽固的侵略政策的受害者——全力支持越南民主共和国外交部一九六七年三月一日的声明，并向兄弟的英雄越南人民所进行的英勇救国斗争热烈致敬。”
