Be Thorough Revolutionaries

Tsinghua University Kuai Dafu

Victory songs resound, red flags flutter, and the east wind sweeps across the land. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born in the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This is another thunderclap in the spring of 1967, another great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and another stirring victory song for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

"Tigers crouch and dragons coil, today's scene surpasses the past; the world is turned upside down, and the sentiment is grand." The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee solemnly declares to all the people of China and the world: the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee has completely collapsed! The bourgeois reactionary line has completely collapsed! The doomsday bell has rung for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their lackeys!

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power." The character "power" has directed the entire history of class society. Over the past ten months, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has swept across our country has been unfolding in a magnificent way around the character "power." Since the Cultural Revolution, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have, in order to retain the "power" they have seized from the proletariat, ruthlessly suppressed the revolutionary masses and implemented white terror. The proletarian revolutionary masses, in order to seize back this "power," have waged a long, arduous, and unyielding struggle. "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards; no heroes fear bears and wolves." The proletarian revolutionary masses have not been intimidated by the white terror. Following our great leader Chairman Mao, they have broken through the surging waves and dangerous rapids, overcome one vicious enemy after another, and achieved one great victory after another! Now, amidst the thunderous cannon fire of annihilating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established. We proletarian revolutionaries have seized back the "power" and taken control. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is our power. Every one of us proletarian revolutionaries should cherish it as we cherish our own eyes. Currently, within the proletarian revolutionary ranks, there exist anarchism, sectarianism, factionalism, opportunism, individualism, and other non-proletarian elements that are corroding the revolution. They are extremely harmful to the consolidation of power and the strengthening of the proletarian dictatorship and must be overthrown and exposed. At present, it is particularly important to launch a fierce struggle against anarchism.

Seizing power is difficult, but holding power is even more difficult. Chairman Mao said: "The victory of the revolution in the whole country is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road ahead after the revolution is even longer, the work is even greater, and the struggle is even more arduous." We still have a lot to do. The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has increased our responsibilities. We must hold high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism and, in the process of struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly criticize and establish new things. We have no regrets for the death of the old system, and we will thoroughly cleanse the muddy water left behind by the bourgeois reactionary line. "By the wrecked boat, a thousand sails pass; before the withered tree, ten thousand flowers bloom." We must be thorough revolutionaries and ensure that our red capital and the holy land of world revolution—Beijing—forever radiates the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, illuminating all of China and shining upon the world!

It can be said with certainty that there will still be many storms and twists and turns on our forward path, but there is nothing to be afraid of.

"Infinite beauty lies on the perilous peak." The final victory is ours!

    做彻底的革命者
    清华大学　蒯大富
    凯歌震天，红旗招展，东风浩荡，北京市革命委员会在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下光荣地诞生了！
    这是一九六七年春天的又一声惊雷，这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一曲激动人心的凯歌！
    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”北京市革命委员会的诞生，向全中国人民、全世界人民庄严宣告：旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团彻底垮台了！资产阶级反动路线已经全线崩溃了！党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其狐群狗党彻底灭亡的丧钟敲响了！北京市的党政财文大权被我们无产阶级革命派夺过来了！
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”一个“权”字导演了整个有阶级以来的人类的历史。十个多月来，在我国大地上兴起的无产阶级文化大革命运动，也是围绕着一个“权”字在波澜壮阔地展开着。文化大革命以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了保住他们从无产阶级手里夺去的“权”，对革命派残酷镇压，实行白色恐怖。无产阶级革命派，为了夺回这个“权”，进行了艰苦曲折、英勇不屈的斗争。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”无产阶级革命派并没有被白色恐怖吓倒，他们跟着我们伟大的领袖毛主席冲破了惊涛骇浪，越过了激流险滩，战胜了一个个凶恶的敌人，取得了一次又一次伟大的胜利！现在，在围歼党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的隆隆炮声中，北京市革命委员会成立了，我们无产阶级革命派夺回了“权”，掌权了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    北京市革命委员会是我们自己的政权，我们每一个无产阶级革命派都应该象爱护自己的眼珠那样来爱护它。目前，在无产阶级革命派内部存在的无政府主义、宗派主义、山头主义、风头主义、个人主义等等非无产阶级的东西是对革命的腐蚀剂。它们对巩固政权和加强无产阶级专政极为有害，必须打倒，必须搞臭。当前，尤其要大反特反无政府主义。
    夺权难，掌权更难。毛主席说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们要做的事情还很多很多。北京市革命委员会的成立，更加重了我们肩头的责任。我们必须高举无产阶级革命的批判旗帜，在斗批改的过程中大破大立。对旧制度的死去我们毫不惋惜，对资产阶级反动路线遗留下来的污泥浊水，我们要彻底予以荡涤。“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。”我们一定要做彻底的革命者，一定要保证我们红色的首都、世界革命的圣地——北京永远放射着毛泽东思想的万丈光芒，普照全中国，辉映全世界！
    可以肯定地说，在我们前进的道路上还会有很多风浪，还会有曲折和反复，但是没有什么了不起。
    “无限风光在险峰”。最后胜利是我们的！
