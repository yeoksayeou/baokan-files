Only by Believing in the Masses Can One Gain Their Trust

Zhang Man, Secretary of the Huanrou County Committee of the Communist Party of China

Last August, the Party transferred me from Sichuan to work in Huanrou County. After arriving in Huanrou County, I was responsible for leading the county's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Because I did not understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, I saw myself only as a revolutionary force and not as a revolutionary target. Therefore, during this period of leadership, I made many mistakes and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line.

In January of this year, revolutionary masses rose up to criticize my shortcomings and errors. The criticism was good; it touched my soul and made me realize my mistakes. At that time, the masses' criticism of me was very intense and sharp, and it came on very strong. I, however, lacked sufficient understanding of my mistakes and failed to pass several self-criticisms. As a result, I developed a sense of resistance, feeling wronged and a bit frightened, thinking, "This time, I might be drowned!" So, for a period, I dared not interact with the masses and only stayed indoors writing self-criticisms. The work of the county committee also could not be carried out.

My inner struggle was intense at this time. Seeing that the spring plowing season had arrived, how was the work of the entire county to be handled? Should I just wait for others to help me up, or should I stand tall and work with the masses to make the revolution? With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works. In the article "Study and the Current Situation," Chairman Mao teaches us: "To win new victories, we must advocate among the Party's cadres the shedding of burdens and the activation of machinery. By shedding burdens, we mean that we should rid ourselves of many of our spiritual burdens." Chairman Mao's teachings deeply moved my heart. After the publication of the editorials in the third and fourth issues of *Red Flag*, I read them over and over again, feeling more and more close to them. I felt that as a Communist Party member, could I still carry the burden and not do the Party's work? No, absolutely not! A Communist, in any situation, must not abandon the Party's work. I must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, be responsible to the people, shed my burdens, and get to work on the revolution!

With such excitement, in early January, I posted my first big-character poster expressing my revolutionary resolve, welcoming the revolutionary masses to continue criticizing my mistakes, and at the same time, I made five suggestions regarding the county's work, expressing my willingness to stand with the revolutionary masses and fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and hoping that the proletarian revolutionary factions would unite to seize the revolution and promote production. After this big-character poster was posted, contrary to my expectations, it did not receive the welcome of the revolutionary masses but was instead criticized. Initially, I could not understand it, but after thinking carefully, I realized that a leading cadre who had made mistakes, standing up to make the revolution, how could one expect to gain the trust of the masses through just one big-character poster or one action? One should allow the masses to have a process of identifying and examining the leading cadres, especially in actual struggles, which is completely reasonable. At this time, I did not lose heart or blame the masses. Instead, I posted a second big-character poster, exposing the implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line by the former Beijing Municipal Committee in the suburbs. This big-character poster also did not receive the welcome of the revolutionary masses. My inner struggle intensified again. I thought: should I retreat or continue to advance? I decided to accept the revolutionary masses' examination of me and the movement's examination of me, to continue to advance and revolutionize to the end! So, I posted a third big-character poster, and then a fourth. I once again expressed my firm support for the revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionary factions and my determination to stand with them to make the revolution together.

After these two big-character posters were posted, the reaction of the revolutionary masses was completely different from before. Some revolutionary mass organizations expressed support for my revolutionary actions, and some comrades even posted big-character posters welcoming me to stand tall and make the revolution. The support of the revolutionary masses gave me great encouragement.

Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." For me, I must fully believe that the vast majority of the masses are revolutionary. Their criticism of me, although very intense and sharp, and sometimes almost unbearable, is for what? They do this out of love for the Party and Chairman Mao, out of high revolutionary enthusiasm, and also to save me. Their actions are fundamentally correct. I should completely stand with the revolutionary masses and together direct fire at my mistakes! If I do not, and instead view the masses' criticism of me as an attack on me, I will stand against the masses, and in reality, stand against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which would be standing on the wrong side and making even greater mistakes.

To stand tall and make the revolution, I still had a concern: the issue of my authority. At that time, I thought, during the movement, the masses posted so many big-character posters about me, would I still have authority when I speak in the future? Could I still work? The facts proved that this concern was due to not believing in the masses. When I seriously examined my mistakes, the masses criticized my mistakes while supporting me in my work. During the county's three-level cadre meeting, I made a self-criticism and expressed my attitude, and the attending comrades applauded me warmly; hearing the applause, I felt warm in my heart. When I went to work in the communes and production brigades, the comrades were even more enthusiastic towards me than before. This close class feeling was formed in the intense class struggle. All of this educated me: the masses are indeed reasonable; not believing in the masses and overthinking authority, face, etc., are all selfish thoughts that must be discarded.

Now, under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help and education of the masses, I have just begun to stand tall. My understanding is still very limited. However, I have one realization: the key to leading cadres standing up to make the revolution lies within oneself. We leading cadres have worked for a long time and have been educated by Chairman Mao and the Party for a long time. We must not carry burdens because of past work; instead, we should demand more of ourselves. Under the criticism and supervision of the masses, we should grasp the transformation of our worldview, remove the "self" and replace it with "public," remove the "fear" and replace it with "dare," and better serve the Party and the revolution, achieving new merits and new labor.

### 只有相信群众才能得到群众信任

    只有相信群众才能得到群众信任
    中共怀柔县委书记　张满
    去年八月，党把我从四川调来怀柔县工作。我到了怀柔县以后，负责领导全县无产阶级文化大革命的工作。由于我对毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命很不理解，只把自己当作革命的力量，没有把自己当作革命对象，所以在这段领导工作中犯了不少错误，执行了资产阶级反动路线。
    今年一月，革命群众起来批判我的缺点错误。批判得好，触及了我的灵魂，使我猛省。当时，群众对我的批判是十分激烈，十分尖锐的，来势很猛。我呢？对自己的错误缺乏足够的认识，先后检查了几次都没有通过。这样，思想上产生了抵触情绪，觉得委屈，又有点害怕，心想：“这回可能要淹死了！”所以，我在一段时间里不敢跟群众接触，只是闷在屋子里头写检查，县委的工作也抓不起来。
    我这时候的思想斗争很激烈，眼看春耕季节已到，全县工作怎么办呢？就这样下去等着别人把自己扶起来呢，还是自己挺起腰杆来跟群众一起干革命呢？我带着这个问题，反复地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席在《学习和时局》这篇文章里教导我们说：“为了争取新的胜利，要在党的干部中间提倡放下包袱和开动机器。所谓放下包袱，就是说，我们精神上的许多负担应该加以解除。”“所以，检查自己背上的包袱，把它放下来，使自己的精神获得解放，实在是联系群众和少犯错误的必要前提之一。”毛主席的教导，句句打动了我的心。《红旗》第三、四期社论发表以后，我又一遍一遍地读，越读越亲切。我觉得，作为一个共产党员，难道还能死背着包袱不放，还能被包袱压着不干党的工作吗？不能，绝对不能！共产党人，在任何情况下都不能丢掉党的工作。我要坚决听毛主席的话，对人民负责，丢掉包袱，起来干革命！
    在这种激动的心情下，我在一月初贴出了第一张表示革命决心的大字报，欢迎革命群众对我的错误继续进行批判，同时还针对全县工作提出了五条建议，表示愿意和革命群众站在一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，并且希望无产阶级革命派联合起来，抓革命、促生产。这张大字报贴出以后，出乎我的意料，不但没有受到革命群众的欢迎，反而受到了批判。起初，我有些想不通，后来认真想一想，才认识到，一个犯了错误的领导干部，站起来革命，怎么能设想通过一张大字报或一个行动就马上要求得到群众的信任呢？应该允许群众对领导干部有一个识别考察的过程，特别要在实际斗争中考察，这完全是合情合理的。这时我没有灰心，更没有埋怨群众。接着又贴出了第二张大字报，对前北京市委在郊区贯彻执行资产阶级反动路线进行了揭发。这张大字报同样没有受到革命群众的欢迎。我的思想斗争又激烈起来了。心想：是退下来，还是继续前进呢？我决心接受革命群众对我的考验，接受运动对我的考验，要继续前进，革命到底！于是，我又贴出了第三张大字报，第四张大字报。再次表示坚决支持无产阶级革命派的革命行动，坚决同他们站在一起，共同闹革命。
    这两张大字报贴出去以后，革命群众的反应就和以前大不一样了。有的革命群众组织表示支持我的革命行动，有的同志还贴大字报欢迎我挺起腰杆干革命。革命群众的支持，给了我巨大的鼓舞。
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”对我来说，必须充分相信绝大多数群众是革命的。他们对我进行的批判，尽管是十分激烈，十分尖锐，甚至有时简直难以接受，但是，他们这样做是为了什么呢？他们这样做，正是出于对党对毛主席的热爱，出于高度的革命热情，也是为了挽救我。他们这样做，大方向是没有错的。我应该完全和革命群众站在一起，共同向我的错误开火！如果不是这样，把群众对自己的批判，看成是整自己，就会和群众对立起来，实际上也就是和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线对立起来，那就会站错了队，就会犯更大的错误。
    要挺起腰杆来干革命，我还有一个顾虑，就是自己的威信问题。当时想，运动中群众贴了我那么多的大字报，今后我说话还会有威信吗？我还能工作下去吗？事实证明，这种顾虑还是不相信群众。当我认真检查错误的时候，群众是一面批判我的错误，一面支持我干工作。在召开县三级干部会的时候，我做了检讨，表明了态度，到会的同志们对我热烈鼓掌；我听到掌声，从心眼里感到温暖。我下到公社和大队去工作的时候，同志们对我比过去更加热情，这种亲密的阶级感情正是在激烈的阶级斗争中形成的。这一切，都教育了我，群众的的确确是通情达理的；不相信群众，过多地考虑威信、面子，等等，那都是私心杂念，必须丢掉。
    现在，我在党和毛主席的关怀下，在群众的帮助、教育下，还是刚刚挺起腰杆，有一些问题认识还很不够。但是我有一条体会，领导干部站起来革命，关键在于自己。我们领导干部，工作时间长，受毛主席和党的教育时间也长。我们决不可因为过去做过一些工作背上包袱，相反的应该更严格地要求自己，在群众的批评和监督下，狠抓自己世界观的改造，去掉“私”字，换上“公”字，去掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，更好地为党为革命工作，建新功、立新劳。
