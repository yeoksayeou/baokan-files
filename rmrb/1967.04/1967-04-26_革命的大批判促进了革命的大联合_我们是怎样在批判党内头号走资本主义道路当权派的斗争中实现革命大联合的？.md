Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries."

On April 7, we, the revolutionary Red Guards of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School, in the midst of the great criticism and struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by them, established a unified revolutionary Red Guard organization for the entire school—the Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School Red Guard Corps. This achieved a revolutionary unity from the bottom up, with the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching classes as the foundation. This is the result of all the Red Guard fighters in our school, in the midst of revolutionary criticism, listening to Chairman Mao's words, executing Chairman Mao's instructions without any deviation, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and correctly carrying out the struggle between the two lines. This is also the result of all the Red Guard fighters in our school, in the midst of revolutionary criticism, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, criticizing "Self-Cultivation," and promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

On April 13, the *People's Daily* and Xinhua News Agency reported to the nation about our school achieving revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism, and the *Wenhui Daily* published an editorial on this. On April 15, the *People's Daily* published an editorial titled "Raising the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism to Achieve Revolutionary Unity." This is the greatest care and support, encouragement, and motivation from our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, to us Red Guards. The good news spread, and the entire school was in an uproar. Students shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" a thousand times and ten thousand times.

How were the differences and oppositions created?

Our school, Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School, is a complete middle school with over 2,400 students and teachers and 44 teaching classes. Workers, peasants, and children of other laboring people account for about 46% of the entire student body. Since the Cultural Revolution, our school has successively established six Red Guard organizations and dozens of combat teams. There have always been sharp differences and oppositions among these organizations and among students. How were these differences and oppositions created?

In June of last year, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, under the direct control of the old Municipal Committee and the old District Committee, some leaders of the school stubbornly carried out the reactionary bourgeois line proposed by the capitalist roaders within the Party. They deliberately deceived some students, diverted the direction of the struggle, and directed the spearhead of the struggle towards ordinary teachers. Later, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, some teachers and students saw through their tricks and plots and were the first to rebel, exposing the problems of the old District Committee and the school leadership. They were at a loss and launched a massive attack and persecution against the revolutionary teachers and students. They incited the masses to fight the masses, deceived a group of students, and planned to establish a conservative organization with one hand, directing the spearhead of the struggle towards the revolutionary teachers and students. Revolutionary students, in order to defend Chairman Mao and uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, also successively organized the "Headquarters of the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought," "Shanghai Command of the Red Guards 818 Combat Team," "Red Three," "East is Red," "Fight to the End," and other five revolutionary Red Guard organizations and dozens of combat teams. Due to the school leadership's implementation of the reactionary bourgeois line, students were divided into two factions. One faction of students bravely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strongly criticized the capitalist roaders within the Party, and strongly criticized the reactionary bourgeois line. One faction of students, however, stood on the side of the reactionary bourgeois line, defending the old Municipal Committee, the old District Committee, the old Party branch of the school, and opposing the revolutionary teachers and students. At the same time, those who stubbornly carried out the reactionary bourgeois line also used the reactionary bloodline theory of the bourgeoisie to strike and expel some students and teachers with bad backgrounds. They used the non-proletarian thoughts such as cliquism and seeking fame among the students, creating contradictions and discord among the students and among the revolutionary rebel organizations of the proletariat.

As the Cultural Revolution deepened, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao achieved decisive victories, and the reactionary bourgeois line collapsed completely. The ugly faces of the capitalist roaders within the old Municipal Committee and the old District Committee were exposed in broad daylight. Through the struggle of the revolutionary students, the original conservative organization also collapsed. At this time, a large number of students went out to link up and "kill" into society, leaving only about 300 to 400 people in the entire school, who had not seriously criticized the reactionary bourgeois line.

In early March, after Chairman Mao's instruction to resume classes and make revolution was issued, the vast number of Red Guard fighters and students responded to Chairman Mao's great call and returned to school. At this time, although everyone had the desire to return to the classroom and achieve school-wide unity based on the teaching classes, due to the reactionary bourgeois line not being thoroughly criticized, students, although returned to the classroom, sat in one classroom but occupied different corners, ignoring each other. Several revolutionary Red Guard organizations were still fiercely engaged in "internal wars" and could not unite at all. This situation seriously affected the deepening of the Cultural Revolution, making it impossible to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and making it impossible to resume classes and make revolution.

The editorial article "The Reactionary Bourgeois Line on the Cadres Must Be Thoroughly Criticized" by the editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine, the investigative report "Striking a Large Area and Protecting a Few" is a part of the reactionary bourgeois line, and Comrade Ji Benyu's "Patriotism or Treason?" were published, sounding the charge to launch a general offensive against the capitalist roaders within the Party. The Cultural Revolution entered a new stage. Nationwide and throughout Shanghai, a broad and deep revolutionary criticism movement was swiftly launched. This revolutionary criticism greatly promoted the revolutionary unity of our school.

The capitalist roaders within the Party are the chief culprits in disrupting great unity

At that time, in the issue of revolutionary unity in our school, there were mainly three aspects of contradictions among the students: First, the contradictions between the revolutionary Red Guards and the Red Guards who had participated in the conservative organization. Second, the contradictions among the revolutionary organizations. Third, due to the harm of the reactionary bloodline theory, there were also contradictions between students with good backgrounds and those with bad backgrounds, that is, the contradictions between the Red Guard fighters and the students who had not participated in the Red Guard organizations. Originally, we only saw these phenomena of contradictions but did not see the root cause of these contradictions and who was the chief culprit in disrupting revolutionary unity. In the criticism, through criticizing the capitalist roaders within the Party, through criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line, criticizing "Self-Cultivation," we increasingly clearly realized that although these contradictions manifested differently and had different contents, the root cause was the same: it was the capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line they put forward. It was to protect a small handful of revisionists, divert the direction of the struggle, incite the masses to fight the masses, and create opposition among the students; it was to use the reactionary bloodline theory of the bourgeoisie to deceive a small number of students, creating estrangement among the students; it was also their book of deceit, "Self-Cultivation," that indirectly advocated bourgeois individualism, poisoning the students, and breeding various non-proletarian thoughts. This Chinese Khrushchev is the chief culprit in disrupting revolutionary unity!

The enemy has a head, and the debt has a master. The students found the root of their estrangement and found their common enemy, immediately joining the revolutionary criticism movement, launching a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders within the Party. The entire school's revolutionary Red Guards and the vast number of students held a series of large and small denunciation, exposure, and criticism meetings, and also held parades and demonstrations. Everyone, with boundless hatred towards the capitalist roaders within the Party, together exposed and criticized the crimes of the reactionary bourgeois line, together denounced the harm of the black "Self-Cultivation" to themselves. Everyone shouted in unison with anger: Overthrow the capitalist roaders within the Party! In the common struggle, the proletarian revolutionary faction realized: the spearhead of the struggle should not be directed at the students who had participated in the conservative organization, but should be directed at the small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party; the students who had participated in the conservative organization also realized that the revolutionary Red Guards were executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, while they were poisoned by the reactionary bourgeois line, and their opposition was wrong. The revolutionary criticism made everyone clear about right and wrong, clarified their thoughts, raised their consciousness, eliminated estrangement, and had a new common political and ideological foundation. In this way, in the common struggle, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they united. Each class, with the revolutionary Red Guards as the core, achieved revolutionary unity. On April 7, the Red Guard Corps of the entire school was established.

Our Experience

In the revolutionary criticism, how to achieve revolutionary unity? We believe that the most important thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly criticize the capitalist roaders within the Party, and criticize "Self-Cultivation." In the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine one's own thoughts and measure one's own actions. In this practice, we have the following experiences:

(1) Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and correctly carry out the struggle between the two lines.

The unity we want to achieve is revolutionary unity, unity on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, not a "hodgepodge," "muddling through," or "big amalgamation." To achieve revolutionary unity, we must resolutely carry out the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, and eliminate its pernicious influence. In the struggle, achieve revolutionary unity. However, how to correctly carry out the struggle between the two lines? Who should be the target? Should it be the students who were deceived and participated in the conservative organization and made mistakes? Should it be the revolutionary organizations and students with different opinions? No. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." In the revolutionary criticism, we must definitely direct the spearhead of the struggle directly at the capitalist roaders within the Party. Only in this way can there be a common basis for unity. At the same time, only by thoroughly criticizing the series of reactionary fallacies of the capitalist roaders within the Party can the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line be thoroughly eliminated, and the students who were deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line can be won over and educated to recognize their mistakes, rise up in revolution, and break with the reactionary bourgeois line, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Concentrate firepower to criticize the capitalist roaders within the Party, achieve revolutionary unity in the revolutionary criticism, this is the current direction of the struggle. We must firmly grasp this direction of the struggle. This is the key to achieving revolutionary unity. At the beginning, we did not realize this, did not grasp this direction well, so we could not unite. Later, we grasped this direction of the struggle, united against the enemy, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity. For example, in Class 2, Grade 2, there was a big estrangement between the revolutionary Red Guards and the students who had participated in the conservative organization. At the beginning, everyone directed the spearhead of criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line downwards, resulting in more criticism and more opposition, and bigger contradictions. In the revolutionary criticism, everyone unanimously directed the spearhead at the capitalist roaders within the Party. The entire class held a meeting to expose and denounce the crimes of the reactionary bourgeois line. At the meeting, many students who had participated in the conservative organization denounced the harm of the reactionary bourgeois line to themselves. They said excitedly: "When we directed the spearhead at our class sisters, we thought we were following the Party's instructions. It was the capitalist roaders within the Party who harmed us. We must resolutely overthrow them!" In this way, everyone united in the common struggle. Now, many Red Guards who had participated in the conservative organization in this class have joined the revolutionary Red Guard organization.

Some comrades say: "The criticism of the reactionary bourgeois line must be implemented." Yes, it must be implemented, but implemented where? We believe it should be implemented in thoroughly criticizing the capitalist roaders within the Party and their reactionary bourgeois line and "Self-Cultivation," and at the same time, combining the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of this unit, implementing it in thoroughly overthrowing the small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Only in this way can the reactionary bourgeois line be criticized deeply and thoroughly, can the struggle, criticism, and transformation of this unit be carried out well, and can the soul of each of us be truly touched in the criticism. If the criticism is implemented on the students who had participated in the conservative organization, it will disperse the current target of the struggle and cannot thoroughly isolate the small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. This will fall into the enemy's trap, and we must not do this.

(2) Eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, eliminate the poison of "Self-Cultivation," and achieve the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

In achieving revolutionary unity, in addition to the harm of the reactionary bourgeois line, anarchism, cliquism, seeking fame, individualism, and various bourgeois thoughts are a big obstacle. In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, we encountered such a situation: big principles were agreed upon, but when it came to specific issues, it was still not agreed upon, and unity could not be achieved. This was mainly due to the bourgeois thoughts at work.

Take our revolutionary faction organization as an example; there were various non-proletarian thoughts. Such as saying: "We are the ones who broke through!" "We are the old rebels, who are you?" "Revolutionary unity should be based on me," and so on. Revolutionary organizations looked down on each other, eager to engage in principle-less "internal wars." Towards the students who had participated in the conservative organization, some revolutionary students also had an attitude of exclusion. Similarly, the students who had participated in the conservative organization also had various non-proletarian thoughts. One was to act out of personal grudges, unwilling to admit defeat, thinking that the revolutionary faction was not much better than themselves; one was to feel that they had fallen behind in the past, made mistakes, and were always downcast and could not hold their heads up, now wanting to rebel but worried about not being welcome; another was to feel that their face was lost, thinking that they had participated in the conservative organization in the past, now wanting to approach the revolutionary faction, but it was not easy to do so. All these manifestations and thoughts were all due to the "self" at work, causing trouble.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There are various non-proletarian thoughts within the Party, which greatly hinder the execution of the Party's correct line." In unity, we must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize "self," thoroughly establish "public," and eliminate all influences of non-proletarian thoughts. Only in this way can revolutionary unity be achieved.

In the process of revolutionary criticism, we deeply felt that various non-proletarian thoughts among our students were largely the result of the capitalist roaders within the Party poisoning and corrupting us with their book, "Self-Cultivation." The tens of thousands of words of deceit, indirectly advocating "self," were all about "self." We must, while struggling against the capitalist roaders within the Party, also seize the "self" in our minds, overthrow "self," and establish "public"!

We, in the process of revolutionary criticism, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," criticizing "Self-Cultivation," using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine our own thoughts, measure our actions, and overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in our revolutionary ranks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, whoever points them out to us is fine. As long as you are correct, we will correct it. If your method is good for the people, we will do it according to your method." We must definitely do as Chairman Mao teaches. While fighting, we must also rectify our work style, and through rectification, what will be criticized and eliminated is not the proletarian revolutionary faction, but the bourgeois thoughts. The proletarian revolutionary faction will only become stronger through rectification.

(3) With the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core, unite the majority of the masses.

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "We must strive to unite all those who can be united. The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated." This is an important guiding ideology for us to achieve revolutionary unity. We must definitely implement Chairman Mao's teaching, help the deceived students liberate themselves from the reactionary bourgeois line, unite the broad masses, and organize a vast revolutionary army.

Revolutionary unity is achieved on the basis of the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, with the proletarian revolutionary faction that insists on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the leading core. Without this, it is very likely to become a "hodgepodge" of the proletarian revolutionary faction organization and the conservative faction organization. To achieve such revolutionary unity, through this period of practice, we believe that we must pay attention to the conditions and methods of unity.

The condition is that the proletarian revolutionary faction must be in the majority and must be supported and trusted by the broad revolutionary masses. The method is to inspire the masses to consciously implement the revolutionary unity from the bottom up, with the teaching classes as the foundation. It cannot be simply merged.

Our school's original revolutionary Red Guards were only about 300 people, accounting for about 15% of the entire student body. After the collapse of the reactionary bourgeois line in our school, politically speaking, we were in the majority, and the revolutionary Red Guard organization in the school was authoritative. But in terms of numbers, we were still not in the majority. When preparing for the great unity, we also thought about dissolving the cross-class Red Guard organizations. However, we thought of a problem: the reactionary bourgeois line has not been thoroughly criticized and overthrown. In the entire school, the revolutionary leftists are in the majority, but when dispersed to each class, they are not completely in the majority. After discussion, we decided that the original cross-class Red Guard organizations would not be dissolved for the time being. Everyone returned to the classes and actively did the work to create conditions for achieving revolutionary unity. On the one hand, we organized everyone to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders within the Party, criticizing and overthrowing the reactionary bourgeois line; on the other hand, we enthusiastically helped the deceived students return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, uniting the vast number of students around us. In this way, the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary faction quickly expanded, and at the same time, the revolutionary faction in each class also received the support and trust of the students, becoming the core force for achieving unity in the class. In this way, the Red Guard detachments were established class by class, achieving class unity with the revolutionary Red Guards as the core. After achieving revolutionary unity in each teaching class, we immediately dissolved the original cross-class Red Guard organizations and established a unified Red Guard organization for the entire school based on the teaching classes, achieving revolutionary unity. The leading cadres of each class and the entire school's Red Guard organization were all elected democratically by the revolutionary Red Guards, and the result was that those who were elected were all Red Guard fighters with a certain prestige among the masses and dared to struggle.

In the revolutionary criticism, how to achieve revolutionary unity, there are countless methods, but ultimately, it is one: seriously read Chairman Mao's books, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions without any deviation. We have no reason to be entangled in trivial issues and not achieve revolutionary unity.

We have initially achieved revolutionary unity based on the teaching classes in the revolutionary criticism. This is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles. The road ahead is longer, greater, and more arduous. We have not yet achieved the "three-in-one combination," the revolutionary criticism still needs to be deepened, and the revolutionary unity still needs to be further consolidated and developed. The task is heavy, and the road is long. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合
    ——我们是怎样在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中实现革命大联合的？
    上海市第六女中红卫兵团
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”
    四月七日，我们上海市六女中革命红卫兵，在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线的大批判、大斗争中，成立了全校统一的革命红卫兵组织——上海市第六女中红卫兵团，实现了以无产阶级革命派为领导核心、以教学班为基础，自下而上的革命大联合。这是我们全校红卫兵战士，在革命的大批判中，听毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，正确开展两条路线斗争的结果。这也是全校红卫兵战士，在革命的大批判中，活学活用毛主席著作，狠批《修养》，促进人的思想革命化的结果。
    四月十三日，《人民日报》和新华社向全国报道了我们学校在革命的大批判中实现了革命的大联合的消息和《文汇报》为此发表的社论，十五日《人民日报》又发表了《高举革命的批判旗帜实现革命的大联合》的社论。这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席对我们红卫兵最大的关怀和支持，最大的鼓舞和鞭策。喜讯传来，全校沸腾，同学们千遍万遍不断地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    分歧和对立是怎样产生的？
    我们市六女中是一所有两千四百多师生、四十四个教学班的完全中学。工农和其他劳动人民子女约占全校同学的百分之四十六。从无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们学校先后建立过六个红卫兵组织和几十个战斗组。这些组织之间、同学之间一直存在尖锐的分歧和对立。这些分歧和对立是怎样产生的呢？
    去年六月，无产阶级文化大革命一开始，在旧市委和旧区委的直接控制下，学校的一些领导人，就顽固地执行了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所提出的资产阶级反动路线。他们别有用心地蒙蔽一部分同学，转移斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头指向一般的教师。以后，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，一部分师生识破了他们的阴谋诡计，首先起来造反，揭发了旧区委和学校领导的问题。他们慌了手脚，对革命派师生大肆围攻、迫害。他们挑动群众斗群众，蒙蔽一批学生，一手策划成立了一个保守派组织，把斗争矛头对准无产阶级革命派师生。革命派同学为了保卫毛主席，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，也先后组织了“毛泽东思想红卫兵总部”、“红卫兵上海司令部八一八战斗队”、“红三司”、“东方红”、“反到底”等五个革命红卫兵组织和几十个战斗组。由于学校领导推行资产阶级反动路线的结果，使同学之间分成了两派。一派同学勇敢地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反。一派同学却站到了资产阶级反动路线一边，保旧市委，保旧区委，保学校旧党支部，反对革命派师生。同时，那些顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人还利用资产阶级的反动的血统论，打击排挤一部分出身不好的同学和教师，利用同学们思想上存在的小团体主义、风头主义等非无产阶级思想，在同学之间，在无产阶级革命造反派组织之间制造矛盾，制造不和。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利，资产阶级反动路线全面崩溃，旧市委、旧区委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的丑恶嘴脸，已经暴露在光天化日之下，经过革命派同学的斗争，原来的保守派组织也垮台了。这时，大批的同学都外出串连，“杀”向社会，全校只剩下三、四百人，对资产阶级反动路线一直没能认真地进行批判。
    三月初，毛主席关于复课闹革命的指示下达以后，广大红卫兵战士和同学纷纷响应毛主席的伟大号召，回到了学校。这时，虽然大家都有“杀”回班级，实行以教学班为基础的全校大联合的愿望，但由于资产阶级反动路线没有得到彻底批判，同学们虽然回到了班级，坐在一个教室里，却各占一方，互不理睬，几个革命红卫兵组织之间还起劲地打着“内战”，根本联合不起来。这样的情况严重地影响了无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，斗、批、改不能进行，复课闹革命也搞不起来。
      《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须彻底批判》、调查员的报告《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》和戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表，吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的号角，无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段。全国以及上海全市迅速地掀起了广泛而深入的革命大批判运动，这场革命的大批判，大大促进了我们学校革命的大联合。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是破坏大联合的罪魁祸首
    当时，我们学校在革命大联合问题上，同学之间主要存在着三方面的矛盾：第一，革命派红卫兵和过去参加过保守派组织红卫兵之间的矛盾。第二，革命派组织之间的矛盾。第三，由于反动血统论的毒害，出身好的和出身不好的同学之间也有矛盾，也就是红卫兵战士和没有参加红卫兵组织的同学之间的矛盾。原来我们只是看到这些矛盾的现象，没有看到这些矛盾的根源是什么，谁是破坏革命大联合的罪魁祸首。在大批判中，我们通过批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，通过批判资产阶级反动路线，批判《修养》，越来越清楚地认识到尽管这些矛盾表现不同，内容也不同，根子却是一个：就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他所抛出的资产阶级反动路线。是他为了保护一小撮修正主义分子，转移斗争大方向，挑动群众斗群众，造成了学生之间的对立；是他利用资产阶级的反动血统论，欺骗少数学生，造成了学生之间的隔阂；也是他那本欺人之谈的《修养》，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，毒害同学们，滋长了形形色色的非无产阶级的思想。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫就是破坏革命大联合的罪魁祸首！
    冤有头，债有主。同学们找到了相互隔阂的祸根，找到了共同的敌人，立即投入了革命的大批判运动，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起了猛烈攻击，全校革命红卫兵和广大同学一起举行了大大小小一系列的控诉、揭发、批判大会，还举行了游行示威。大家怀着对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的无比仇恨，一起揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，一起控诉黑《修养》对自己的毒害。大家同声愤怒地高呼：打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派！在共同的战斗中，无产阶级革命派认识到：斗争的矛头不应指向原来参加过保守派组织的同学，而应该指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；参加过保守派组织的同学也认识到革命派红卫兵执行的是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，而自己是受了资产阶级反动路线的毒害，同他们对立是错误的。革命的大批判，使大家明确了是非，弄清了思想，提高了觉悟，消除了隔阂，在政治上、思想上有了新的共同基础。这样就在共同的斗争中，在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下联合起来了。各班级都以革命红卫兵为核心实现革命的大联合。四月七日，成立了全校的红卫兵团。
    我们的体会
    在革命的大批判中怎样实现革命的大联合？我们认为：最重要的是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一切按毛主席的指示办事。紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，批臭《修养》。在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席的教导来检查自己的思想，衡量自己的行动。在这段实践中，我们有以下几点体会：
    （一）紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，正确开展两条路线的斗争。
    我们要实现的联合，是革命的大联合，是在毛主席革命路线上的大联合，不是“大杂烩”，“和稀泥”，“大捏合”。要实现革命的大联合，必须坚决开展两条路线的斗争，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清其恶劣影响，在斗争中实现革命的大联合。但是，如何正确开展两条路线的斗争？矛头指向谁？是指向过去受蒙蔽参加过保守派组织犯有错误的同学吗？是指向有不同意见的革命组织和同学吗？都不是。毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”在革命的大批判中，我们一定要把斗争矛头直接指向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。只有这样才有共同团结的基础。同时也只有彻底批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一系列反动谬论，才能彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，才能争取、教育过去受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同学认识自己的错误，起来革命，和资产阶级反动路线决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    集中火力批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，这是当前斗争的大方向。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个斗争的大方向。这是实现革命大联合的关键。开始，我们由于没有认清这一点，没有很好地把握这个大方向，所以总是联合不起来。后来我们抓住了这个斗争的大方向，共同对敌，很快就实现了革命的大联合。例如，高二（2）班，原来革命红卫兵和参加过保守派组织的同学隔阂很大。开头，大家把批判资产阶级反动路线的矛头向下，结果越批判越对立，矛盾越大。在革命的大批判中，大家一致把矛头指向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，全班召开了揭发控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行的大会。在大会上，许多参加过保守派组织的同学控诉了资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害。她们激动地说：“当我们把矛头指向自己的阶级姊妹时，还以为自己是听党的话。这是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派害了我们，我们要坚决打倒他！”这样大家就在共同的斗争中团结起来了。现在这个班级许多参加过保守派组织的红卫兵已参加了革命的红卫兵组织。
    有的同志说：“对资产阶级反动路线的批判要落实。”对，是要落实的，但落实在那里？我们认为是要落实在彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其资产阶级反动路线和《修养》上，同时把大批判和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，落实在彻底斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派上。这样才可以批深批透资产阶级反动路线，才可以把本单位的斗、批、改搞好，才可以在批判中真正触及我们每个人的灵魂。如果把批判落实到参加过保守派组织的同学身上，就会分散了当前的斗争目标，不能彻底孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这正中了敌人的奸计，我们决不能这样做。
    （二）破私立公，清除《修养》的流毒，实现人的思想革命化。
    在实现革命的大联合中，除了资产阶级反动路线的毒害之外，无政府主义、小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义等等形形色色资产阶级思想影响是一个很大的障碍。我们在实现革命的大联合过程中，就曾碰到过这样的情况：大的原则通了，一致了，但一碰到具体问题就谈不通，仍是联合不起来。这主要是资产阶级思想在作怪。
    拿我们革命派组织内部来说，就存在着各种非无产阶级思想。如说：“我们是闯出来的！”“我们是老造反，你们算老几？”“大联合要以我为主”，等等。革命组织之间相互看不起，热中于打无原则的“内战”。对参加过保守组织的同学，有的革命派同学也抱着排斥的态度。同样，参加过保守派组织的同学，也存在着各种各样的非无产阶级思想。一种是从个人意气出发，不服气，认为革命派也比我强不了多少；一种是觉得过去落后了一步，犯错误，整天灰溜溜的抬不起头来，现在想起来造反，又担心不受欢迎；还有一种是觉得面子不好看，以为过去参加过保守派组织，现在要向革命派靠拢，不大好意思。所有这些表现、想法，统统是“私”字在作怪，在搞鬼。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”在大联合中，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，肃清一切非无产阶级思想的影响，这样才能实现革命的大联合。
    在革命的大批判过程中，我们深深体会到，我们同学身上存在的各种非无产阶级思想，很大一部分就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派那本《修养》腐蚀、毒害的结果。洋洋数万言的欺人之谈，拐弯抹角宣扬的就是一个“私”字。我们必须在斗争党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的同时，也夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，打倒“私”字，树立“公”字！
    我们在革命的大批判中，活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学习“老三篇”，批判《修养》，用毛主席的教导来检查自己的思想，衡量我们的行动，克服我们革命队伍中形形色色的非无产阶级思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”我们一定要按照毛主席的这个教导去做。一边战斗，一边整风，通过整风，搞臭的决不是无产阶级革命派，而是资产阶级思想。无产阶级革命派只有越整越坚强。
    （三）以无产阶级革命派为核心，团结大多数群众。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”这就是我们实现革命的大联合的重要指导思想。我们一定要坚决实行毛主席的这一教导，帮助受蒙蔽的同学从资产阶级反动路线下解放出来，团结广大群众，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    革命的大联合是在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现的，是以坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级革命派为领导核心的大联合。离开了这一点，就很可能成为无产阶级革命派组织和保守派组织“合二而一”的大合并，成为大杂烩。要实现这样的革命的大联合，我们通过这一段的实践，认为必须注意联合的条件和方法。
    条件，就是无产阶级革命派必须占优势，并且受到广大革命群众的支持和信任。方法，就是启发群众自觉地实行自下而上的、以教学班为基础的革命大联合。不能简单的合并了事。
    我们学校原来革命的红卫兵只三百多人，只占全校同学的百分之十五左右。在我校的资产阶级反动路线崩溃之后，从政治上说，我们是占优势的，革命的红卫兵组织在学校里是有权威的。但从数量上说还不占优势。在筹备大联合时，我们也曾经想把跨班级的红卫兵组织解散了。但是，我们想到一个问题，资产阶级反动路线还没有彻底批倒、批臭，从全校说，革命左派占优势，分散到各个班级并不完全占优势。经过辩论之后，我们决定原来跨班级的红卫兵组织暂时不解散，大家都回班级去，积极做工作，为实现革命的大联合创造条件。我们一方面组织大家向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，把资产阶级反动路线批倒、批臭；另一方面，我们热情地帮助受蒙蔽的同学回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，把广大同学团结在自己的周围。这样，就使无产阶级革命派的队伍迅速扩大，同时，革命派在各个班级里也都受到同学们的支持和信任，成为班级里实现大联合的核心力量。这样逐个班级地成立红卫兵分队，实现以革命红卫兵为核心的班级大联合。在各个教学班实现了革命的大联合之后，我们立即解散了原来跨班级的红卫兵组织，成立了全校以教学班为基础的统一的红卫兵组织，实现了革命的大联合。各个班级和全校的红卫兵组织的领导骨干，都是由革命红卫兵通过民主选举产生的，结果当选的都是在群众中有一定威信、敢于斗争的红卫兵战士。
    在革命的大批判中怎样实现革命的大联合，千条万条，归根结底就是一条：认真读毛主席的书，坚决听毛主席的话，不折不扣地照毛主席指示办事，永远紧跟毛主席，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们没有任何理由纠缠在枝节问题上不实现革命的大联合。
    我们在革命的大批判中，初步实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。这只是万里长征走完了第一步。今后的路程更长，更伟大，更艰巨。我们还没有实现革命的“三结合”，革命的大批判还要深入下去，革命的大联合还要进一步巩固发展。任重而道远。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展革命的大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
