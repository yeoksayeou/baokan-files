Today, as the resounding victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fill the skies, our people commemorate the 97th anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin.

Lenin, following Marx and Engels, was the great revolutionary leader of the proletariat and oppressed nations worldwide.

Lenin founded the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and led the Soviet people to victory in the Great October Socialist Revolution, establishing the world's first socialist state.

When discussing the history of the development of Marxism, Lenin wrote: "Marxism, in the course of its life, has had to fight at every step." Lenin's life was spent in resolute and sharp struggles against all kinds of enemies of the proletariat. In his merciless struggle against various forms of revisionism and opportunism, Lenin defended Marxism and advanced it to a new historical stage—the stage of Leninism.

In his struggle against revisionism and opportunism, Lenin defended and developed Marxism's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin pointed out: "Only those who recognize the class struggle and also recognize the dictatorship of the proletariat are Marxists." Lenin also said: "The most important question in any revolution is the question of state power. Who holds the state power decides everything." Therefore, before the proletariat and revolutionary people seize power, they must adhere to the principle of violent revolution, smash the old state machine, and seize power by force. After the proletariat and revolutionary people seize power, they must defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the socialist revolution to completion. Without power, the proletariat has nothing; with power, they have everything; losing power means losing everything. This is a fundamental law of class struggle and an extremely important lesson from the international communist movement.

On this day, as we commemorate the 97th anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin, we cannot help but see this harsh fact: in the homeland of Leninism, the Soviet Union, the power has been usurped by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has been transformed into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, have betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the October Revolution, and betrayed the Soviet people and the people of the world. They are the greatest traitor and scab clique in history.

Revisionism is the mortal enemy of Marxism, but they always swear by the name of Marx. Lenin said: "It is impossible to prevent them from doing this, just as it is impossible to prevent a firm from using any trademark, sign, or advertisement." Today's Soviet revisionist leadership is exactly the same. This small group of despicable traitors actually call themselves "heirs to Lenin's cause," using the banner of Leninism to deceive and swindle, reaching the height of shamelessness!

Today's Soviet revisionist clique is the offspring of the revisionists whom Lenin once criticized, and their crimes are a hundred times more heinous than those of their predecessors.

They have turned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by Lenin, into a "party of the whole people," actually degenerating it into a new Social Democratic Party, a bourgeois party. Aren't they the opportunists whom Lenin criticized for "betraying the party"?

They openly practice bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union, fully restoring capitalism, burying the achievements of the October Revolution, and changing the color of the socialist state built by Lenin. Aren't they the "agents of the bourgeoisie" whom Lenin criticized?

They kowtow to imperialism, pursuing a line of capitulation, and are willing to sell out the interests of the revolutionary people of the world, seeking "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world." Aren't they the "slaves serving imperialism" whom Lenin criticized?

They peddle the goods of "peaceful transition" everywhere, corrupting the revolutionary will of the people of various countries, opposing the oppressed peoples' use of revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence and seize power by force. Aren't they the "renegades" whom Lenin criticized?

They have done countless evil deeds of false support and true betrayal in the struggle for liberation of oppressed nations, helping imperialism to suppress national liberation movements in various places, even acting as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Vietnamese people. Aren't they the "traitors and scoundrels" whom Lenin criticized?

Marxism-Leninism tells us that the emergence of revisionism is not an accident; it has social roots. As long as imperialism exists, as long as the bourgeoisie exists, revisionism will emerge. Fifty years ago, Lenin said: "We believe that in a few decades, in the 'unified' international socialist movement, new Plehanovs, Scheidemanns, and new and gentle conciliators like Kautsky will grow up." What Lenin predicted has indeed happened. This is nothing surprising. The modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, which is rampant for a time, is only a manifestation of the desperate struggle of imperialism in the process of its demise. It absolutely cannot stop the victorious advance of Marxism-Leninism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao is the true heir to Lenin's cause. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards victory worldwide. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, solves the problem of mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to carry out a great revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat; solves the problem of seizing power from a small handful of power-holders within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat who are taking the capitalist road; solves the problem of preventing capitalist restoration and ensuring that our country will never change color. This is a great development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao, equal in importance and greatness to Marx's establishment of the scientific theory of socialism and Lenin's establishment of the theory of the proletariat seizing power in one country. This unprecedented great revolution not only greatly consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country but also opens up a new era in the international communist movement, sounding the death knell for imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism.

Marxism-Leninism has always developed in the face of opposition and curses from the enemy. When Marxism was just born, all the reactionary forces in Europe united to drive out this "specter" that appeared in Europe. When Leninism was born, the Second International revisionists and various scabs and traitors united to oppose Leninism. Leninism not only suffered the hatred and curses of imperialists, reactionaries, and international revisionists but also the frenzied attacks of bourgeois elements within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, such as Trotsky and Bukharin. Now, imperialism and reactionaries of all countries are colluding with modern revisionism to fiercely attack the great Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, the biggest handful of power-holders within our party who are taking the capitalist road and revisionist elements are also echoing the class enemies at home and abroad, fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought. These domestic and foreign revisionists oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which means they oppose Marxism, oppose Leninism, and oppose revolution. However, no matter who it is, no matter what banner they use, whoever opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will only end up with a humiliating fate. "Their names and reputations will perish together, but the rivers will flow on forever." There is no force in the world that can stop Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought from achieving victory worldwide!

"Even heaven ages if it has feelings, the right way in the world is change." Although the power in the homeland of Leninism has temporarily been usurped by the revisionist clique, socialism will inevitably defeat revisionism and capitalism. This is the inevitable law of historical development. The great Soviet people will not long tolerate the revisionist rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The glory of Leninism will once again shine over the Soviet land!

Long live Leninism! Smash modern revisionism!

    纪念伟大的列宁，打倒现代修正主义！
    本报评论员
    今天，我国人民在响彻云霄的无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，纪念伟大列宁诞生九十七周年。
    列宁是继马克思、恩格斯之后，全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的伟大革命导师。
    列宁缔造了苏联共产党，领导苏联人民取得了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。
    列宁在论述马克思主义发展历史的时候写道：马克思主义“在其生命的途程中每走一步都得经过战斗”。列宁的一生，就是在同无产阶级的各种各样的敌人进行坚决的尖锐的斗争中度过的。列宁在同形形色色的修正主义、机会主义者进行无情的斗争中，保卫了马克思主义，并把马克思主义推进到一个新的历史阶段，即列宁主义阶段。
    列宁在同修正主义、机会主义的斗争中，捍卫和发展了马克思主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。列宁指出：“只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”列宁还说过：“任何一个革命的最主要的问题都是国家政权问题。政权在哪一个阶级手里，这一点决定一切。”因此，在无产阶级和革命人民取得政权以前，必须坚持暴力革命的原则，打碎旧的国家机器，武装夺取政权。在无产阶级和革命人民取得政权以后，必须保卫和巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底。无产阶级没有政权，就没有一切；有了政权，就有了一切；丧失政权，就丧失一切。这是阶级斗争的一条根本规律，也是国际共产主义运动的一条极其重要的经验教训。
    在纪念伟大列宁诞生九十七周年的今天，我们不能不看到这样一个严酷的事实：在列宁主义的故乡苏联，那里的政权已经为赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所篡夺，那里的无产阶级专政已经变为资产阶级专政。赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了十月革命，背叛了苏联人民和全世界人民。他们是古往今来最大的叛徒集团和工贼集团。
    修正主义是马克思主义死敌，但是他们又总是拿马克思的名字来赌咒发誓。列宁说过：“要禁止他们这样做是不可能的，正如不能禁止一个商号使用任何一种商标、招牌和广告一样。”今天的苏修领导集团也正是这样。这一小撮卑鄙的叛徒，居然自称为“列宁事业的继承者”，打着列宁主义的招牌招摇撞骗，真是无耻到了极点！
    今天的苏修集团，就是当年列宁所斥责的那些修正主义者的徒子徒孙，而他们的罪恶比他们前辈要深重百倍。
    他们把列宁缔造的苏联共产党，搞成一个“全民党”，实际上蜕变成为一个新的社会民主党，一个资产阶级政党。他们不正是列宁所斥责的“走到了背叛党的地步”的机会主义者吗？
    他们在苏联明目张胆地实行资产阶级专政，全面复辟资本主义，葬送了十月革命的成果，使列宁建立的社会主义国家变了颜色。他们不正是列宁所斥责的“资产阶级代理人”吗？
    他们向帝国主义卑躬屈膝，实行投降主义路线，不惜出卖世界革命人民的利益，追求“美苏合作主宰世界”。他们不正是列宁所斥责的“为帝国主义‘效劳’的奴才”吗？
    他们到处贩卖“和平过渡”的私货，腐蚀各国人民的革命意志，反对被压迫人民用革命的暴力反抗反革命的暴力，武装夺取政权。他们不正是列宁所斥责的“变节分子”吗？
    他们对被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，干尽了假支持、真出卖的罪恶勾当，帮助帝国主义扑灭各个地方的民族解放运动，甚至充当美帝国主义侵略越南人民的头号帮凶。他们不正是列宁所斥责的“叛徒和恶棍”吗？
    马克思列宁主义告诉我们，修正主义的出现，并不是偶然现象，它是有社会根源的。只要帝国主义还存在，资产阶级还存在，就会产生修正主义。列宁在五十年前曾经说过：“我们相信几十年以后，在‘统一的’国际社会民主主义运动中一定会成长起来新的普列汉诺夫、谢德曼和新的和善的调和派考茨基之流。”列宁所预料的事情果然是发生了。这当然没有什么了不起。以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义泛滥一时，不过是帝国主义灭亡过程中的一种垂死挣扎的表现。它绝对阻挡不了马克思列宁主义胜利前进。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，是列宁事业的真正继承者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义在全世界走向胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下发动亿万群众进行大革命的问题；解决了向无产阶级专政机构内部一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行夺权斗争的问题；解决了防止资本主义复辟，保证我国永不变色的问题。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的一个伟大发展，同马克思建立科学的社会主义学说，列宁建立无产阶级在一个国家内夺取政权的学说同样重要，同样伟大。这个史无前例的伟大革命，不仅大大巩固了我国的无产阶级专政，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元，敲响了帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的丧钟。
    马克思列宁主义从来都是在敌人的反对和咒骂声中发展的。当马克思主义刚刚诞生的时候，欧洲一切反动势力都联合起来，妄图驱逐这个在欧洲出现的“幽灵”。当列宁主义诞生的时候，第二国际修正主义者和形形色色的工贼、叛徒，又联合起来反对列宁主义。列宁主义不仅遭到帝国主义、反动派和国际修正主义者的痛恨和咒骂，也遭到联共党内的资产阶级分子托洛茨基、布哈林之流的疯狂攻击。现在，帝国主义、各国反动派又同现代修正主义勾结起来，死命地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。同时，我国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和修正主义分子，也同国内外阶级敌人相呼应，大肆反对毛泽东思想。这些国内外的修正主义者反对毛泽东思想，就是反对马克思主义，就是反对列宁主义，也就是反对革命。但是，不管是什么人，不管他打着什么招牌，谁要反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，谁就只能碰得头破血流，遭到可耻的下场。“尔曹身与名俱灭，不废江河万古流。”世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在全世界取得胜利！
    “天若有情天亦老，人间正道是沧桑。”在列宁主义的故乡，虽然暂时被修正主义集团篡夺了政权，但是，社会主义必将战胜修正主义、资本主义，这是历史发展的必然规律。伟大的苏联人民决不会长期容忍苏修叛徒集团的修正主义统治。列宁主义的光辉必将重新普照苏维埃的大地！
    列宁主义万岁！打倒现代修正主义！
