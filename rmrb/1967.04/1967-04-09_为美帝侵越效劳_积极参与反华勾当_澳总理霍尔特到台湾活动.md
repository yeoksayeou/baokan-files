Taipei, April 8 (New China News Agency) — Australian Prime Minister Holt openly antagonizes the Chinese and Asian peoples. From April 4 to 6, he engaged in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, whom the Chinese people despise, to serve U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Asia.

The Australian government is one of the active accomplices providing cannon fodder for the U.S. war in Vietnam and is also a lackey vigorously promoting U.S. anti-China policies. Holt's visit to Southeast Asia came right after U.S. President Johnson held a secret meeting in Guam to further escalate the war in Vietnam. His purpose is obviously to help the U.S. further expand the war in Vietnam and actively participate in U.S. anti-China activities.

During his activities in Taiwan, Holt held talks with Chiang Kai-shek and other leaders of the Chiang clique, such as Yen Chia-kan, on issues including the U.S. war in Vietnam, the situation in Southeast Asia, and joint opposition to the Chinese people. The "joint communiqué" issued after the talks boasted about the "contributions" both sides have made to the U.S. war in Vietnam and declared that they would continue to make "joint efforts" for this cause. The communiqué also advocated strengthening their "friendship." During his stay in Taiwan, Holt also met with various leaders of the Chiang clique in the political, military, and economic sectors, vigorously promoting the development of trade relations and cultural exchanges with the Chiang bandits.

It is not surprising that the Australian government is so close with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It has always followed the U.S., opposed China, and after Holt took office last year, he even sent an "ambassador" to the Chiang clique. This time, Holt personally visited Taiwan, further exposing the Australian government's reactionary stance of opposing the Chinese people and colluding with the Chiang bandits to act as lackeys of U.S. imperialism.

### 为美帝侵越效劳　积极参与反华勾当  澳总理霍尔特到台湾活动

    为美帝侵越效劳　积极参与反华勾当
    澳总理霍尔特到台湾活动
    新华社八日讯　台北消息：澳大利亚总理霍尔特，公然敌视中国人民和亚洲人民，从四日到六日在台湾同中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮进行勾搭，为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的政策效劳。
    澳大利亚政府是积极为美国侵越战争提供炮灰的帮凶之一，也是为美国反华政策大卖力气的一个走卒。霍尔特是在美帝国主义头子约翰逊最近在关岛召开了进一步扩大侵越战争的黑会之后，到东南亚地区进行活动的，其目的显然是为美国进一步扩大侵越战争帮忙，并积极参与美国的反华勾当。
    霍尔特在台湾活动期间，曾先后同匪首蒋介石和蒋帮头目严家淦等就美国侵越战争、东南亚局势和共同反对中国人民的问题进行了“会谈”。会谈后发表的“联合公报”吹嘘双方为美国侵越战争所作出的“贡献”，并且叫嚷还要继续为此作出“共同努力”。公报还鼓吹要“加强”他们之间的“友谊”。霍尔特在台湾还先后会见了蒋帮的政治、军事、经济等各方面的头目，大肆宣扬要同蒋匪帮发展贸易关系和文化往来。
    澳大利亚政府同蒋介石匪帮打得如此火热是并不奇怪的，它一贯追随美帝，反对中国，霍尔特在去年上台后还公然向蒋帮派出了“大使”。这次霍尔特亲自出马，到台湾活动，更加暴露了澳大利亚政府坚持与中国人民为敌，伙同蒋帮充当美帝国主义帮凶的反动面目。
