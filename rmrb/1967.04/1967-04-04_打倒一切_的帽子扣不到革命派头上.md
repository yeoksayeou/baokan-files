Recently, some people with ulterior motives have been loudly shouting at the proletarian revolutionary faction, "You started with 'doubt everything,' and you have overthrown all the cadres." They attempt to place the "overthrow everything" hat on the heads of the revolutionary youngsters.

This is a gross slander against the revolutionary youngsters.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction has been storming and charging, smashing the various plots of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and winning victory after victory. We rely on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary youngsters, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have always correctly grasped the direction of the struggle. Our target is very clear: to concentrate on striking the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The "overthrow everything" hat cannot be placed on our heads.

There are indeed people who advocate the blanket rejection and overthrow of cadres, and these are the people who formulated the bourgeois reactionary line. The "overthrow everything" wind blew from them. Now they pretend to be concerned about the cadres, which is truly laughable! In fact, "the heart of Sima Zhao is known to all." They are just trying to play new tricks, slander the revolutionary faction, and launch a counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary faction.

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the people who formulated the bourgeois reactionary line hastily dispatched work teams everywhere to suppress the revolutionary mass movement. On the one hand, they labeled revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and on the other hand, they overthrew all cadres who dared to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, making them all stand aside, creating a "one-pot stew," confusing class lines, and shifting the target of struggle.

Labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "striking a large number of cadres" are two manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary line, with only one purpose: to shift the direction of struggle and protect the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party from passing the test and restoring capitalism. Through ruthless struggle and suppression of a "large number" of cadres, they aim to achieve the goal of protecting the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is the evil plot of the people who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line. Their bourgeois likes and dislikes are so clear!

It must be pointed out that in the cadre issue, advocating "striking a large number and protecting a handful" has been their consistent stance and practice. In 1947, during the land reform in the old liberated areas and in the "Three Investigations and Three Rectifications" movement in 1948, they proposed "kicking out old cadres with one foot," treating cadres as "stones," and advocating "moving stones." At that time, Chairman Mao opposed this with a sharp counterattack: "For those party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated, and who are different from those who are beyond redemption, no matter what their origins, they should be educated rather than abandoned." In 1964, during the socialist education movement, they again pushed a line that was "left" in form but right in essence, promoting Wang X's "Peach Garden Experience," making grassroots cadres "pass the test" and "go down the stairs," putting all cadres "to one side," and confusing the two types of contradictions. Chairman Mao timely stopped this practice, personally presiding over the drafting of the "Twenty-Three Articles," clarifying that the focus of the movement was to rectify the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and clearly pointing out: "In dealing with cadres, the method of one divided into two should be used. Towards them, a serious, active, and enthusiastic attitude should be adopted." Reiterating the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the patient," and the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." In this Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao again personally presided over the drafting of the "Sixteen Articles," systematically expounding the Party's consistent cadre policy, and clearly pointing out that the majority of cadres are good and relatively good, and that through the movement, the goal of uniting ninety-five percent should be achieved.

At the critical moment when the Cultural Revolution entered the stage of "three-in-one" combined seizure of power, the great leader Chairman Mao taught us: As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible despite repeated education, they should be allowed to change and encouraged to redeem themselves with meritorious service.

It can be seen that the opposition between the two lines and the difference between the two cadre policies have always been so sharp and clear! Only the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and an important component of this line—Chairman Mao's cadre policy—is the only correct and great one.

However, some people with ulterior motives use the tactic of hitting back, falsely accusing the revolutionary masses and the proletarian revolutionary line of blanket rejection and overthrow of cadres. This preposterous and confusing behavior is so despicable! In fact, their trick is not new. The class enemy only has so many moves. First, they openly oppose, and when they can no longer mix in, they wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. When this trick no longer deceives people, they bite back, placing various charges on the revolutionary faction, using this to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, and paving the way for the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. Their trick is actually in vain. The people's eyes are sharp, and history will make the correct judgment. Indeed, within the revolutionary faction, some comrades have unconsciously made various mistakes to a certain extent, which is precisely because they have been influenced by the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line. But this not only cannot be blamed on the masses; the bourgeois reactionary line should be even more guilty. Those who parrot others should wake up and not be fooled by the proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line.

We should hold high the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and thoroughly criticize, denounce, and overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line. At present, we must especially thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a handful" in the cadre issue. At this decisive moment of "a million heroes crossing the Yangtze River," we must make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and seize the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution!

    “打倒一切”的帽子扣不到革命派头上
    红勇兵　卫东彪
    最近，某些人别有用心地冲着无产阶级革命派起劲地嚷道：“你们是靠‘怀疑一切’起家的，你们把干部统统打倒”。妄想把“打倒一切”的帽子扣到革命小将的头上。
    这是对革命小将的极大诬蔑。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派，叱咤风云，冲锋陷阵，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的种种阴谋，夺得了一个又一个的胜利。我们靠的是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。革命小将遵照毛主席的指示，始终正确地掌握了斗争的大方向。我们的斗争目标明确得很，这就是集中打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。“打倒一切”这顶帽子根本扣不到我们头上来。
    主张对干部一概排斥、一概打倒是确有其人的，这就是制订资产阶级反动路线的那几个人。“打倒一切”这股阴风，就是从他们那里刮出来的。现在他们倒装出一副关心干部的样子，真是滑天下之大稽！其实，“司马昭之心，路人皆知”。他们这样做，不过是想耍弄新花招，诬害革命派，向无产阶级革命派进行反扑。
    在文化大革命才开始的时候，制订资产阶级反动路线的那几个人，就匆匆忙忙派工作组，到处镇压革命群众运动，一方面把革命群众打成“反革命”，另一方面把要起来同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争的干部一律打倒，让他们一律靠边站，来个“一锅煮”，搅乱阶级阵线，转移斗争目标。
    把革命群众打成“反革命”，对干部“打击一大片”，这是资产阶级反动路线的两种表现形式，其目的只有一个，就是为了转移斗争大方向，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派过关，复辟资本主义。通过对“一大片”干部的残酷斗争，无情打击，来达到保护一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的目的，这就是提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人的罪恶阴谋。他们的资产阶级爱憎是何等鲜明啊！
    必须指出，在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是他们的一贯的主张和做法。一九四七年在老解放区土地改革和一九四八年“三查三整”运动中，他们就提出“一脚踢开老干部”，把干部当成“石头”，要搞什么“搬石头”。那时，毛主席就针锋相对地提出：“对于那些犯了错误但是还可以教育的、同那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们。”一九六四年在社会主义教育运动中，他们又搞了一条形“左”实右的路线，推广王××的什么“桃园经验”，要基层干部人人“过关”，个个“下楼”，把干部一律“放在一边”，混淆两类矛盾。毛主席又及时制止了这种做法，亲自主持制订了二十三条，阐明运动的重点是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，明确指出：“看待干部，要用一分为二的方法。对他们，要采取严肃、积极、热情的态度。”重申“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，和“团结——批评——团结”的公式。在这次文化大革命中，毛主席又亲自主持制订了十六条，系统地阐明了我党一贯坚持的干部政策，并且明确地指出，大多数干部是好的和比较好的，通过运动要达到团结两个百分之九十五。
    在文化大革命进入“三结合”联合夺权的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席又教导我们：只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。
    可见，两条路线的对立，两种干部政策的区别，历来就是何等的尖锐，何等的分明啊！只有以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，和这条路线的一个重要组成部分——毛主席的干部政策，才是唯一正确和伟大的。
    但是，一些别有用心的家伙，却使出倒打一耙的手段，把对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的罪名倒栽在革命群众头上，倒栽在无产阶级革命路线的头上。这种颠倒是非、混淆黑白的行径是多么卑鄙！其实，他们这一手也不是什么新的绝招，阶级敌人无非是那末几手，先是公开对抗，在混不下去的时候，就打着“红旗”反红旗，到这一手也骗不了人的时候，就反咬一口，把种种罪名栽到革命派头上，借此制造反革命舆论，为资本主义反革命复辟的逆流鸣锣开道。他们的这一招实际上也是枉费心机。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，历史会作出正确的结论。诚然，革命派的内部，也有些同志不自觉地在一定程度上犯过这样那样的错误，这正是因为受到资产阶级反动路线流毒的影响，但这不仅不能责怪群众，对资产阶级反动路线反而应该罪加一等。那些人云亦云的糊涂人，也应该清醒，切不要上资产阶级反动路线提出者的当。
    我们应当高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的大旗，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，彻底地把资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭批垮。当前，尤其要彻底批判在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。在这“百万雄师过大江”的决战时刻，我们要下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去夺取文化大革命的决定性胜利！
