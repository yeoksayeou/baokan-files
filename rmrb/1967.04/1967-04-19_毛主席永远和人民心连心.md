In the midst of the triumphant march of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and at the moment when the masses are launching a total offensive against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, we watched the film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts - Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." Our hearts are so unsettled!

This film depicts the boundless love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary students, and Red Guards for our great leader Chairman Mao. It also shows our great commander Chairman Mao's concern for the masses, his trust in the masses, and his support for the masses' revolutionary struggle. Chairman Mao's heart is forever with the people, and this is the red thread running through the film.

Look! When the revolutionary masses see their dearest and most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, their hearts are filled with such excitement! How many people shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and how many people had tears in their eyes! What could be more joyful than this? In this ocean of joy, there are Red Guards who traveled thousands of miles on foot to Beijing, just to see Chairman Mao. When they finally saw the Chairman they had been longing for day and night, how could they not be moved to tears? In this ocean of joy, there are revolutionary fighters who were once labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and "fake leftists, real rightists" by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. During the days when the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie was pressing down like a dark cloud, they silently chanted: "Looking up at the North Star, thinking of Mao Zedong." Now that they have seen the Chairman they have been longing for day and night, how could they not shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, ten thousand times?

"We want to see Chairman Mao! We want to see Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary masses, with their boundless love for Chairman Mao, shouted this over and over again. Chairman Mao understands the feelings of the revolutionary masses. He agreed to their request. With a smile on his face, he shook hands with us and waved to us. We have so much to say to Chairman Mao! All our words can be summed up in one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

At night, when the fireworks soared into the sky, Chairman Mao came among us again. Despite a day's fatigue, he sat with us on the ground to watch the colorful fireworks. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You care for us the most, you trust us the most! You are always with us!

"Only the people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Our great leader Chairman Mao believes in the masses and respects the masses. In the past, he led us through countless rapids and difficulties, overcoming all kinds of hardships, and achieved great victories in our revolution and construction. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he is leading us to charge against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly smashing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie.

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party completely goes against Mao Zedong Thought, standing in opposition to the masses. It was he who vigorously promoted the reactionary film "The Last Emperor," which slandered the revolutionary masses of the Boxers as "mad." It was he who, during the socialist education movement, pushed the reactionary line of "left in form, right in essence." It was he who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, colluded with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, formulated and pushed a reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and fiercely suppressed revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. His deeds are so evil!

The current situation is excellent, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved great victories. Let us raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high!

    毛主席永远和人民心连心

    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，在亿万革命群众向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的时刻里，看了电影《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年》，我们的心情是多么的不平静啊！
    这部影片，表现了我国广大工农兵群众、广大革命干部、革命师生和红卫兵小将们对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱；表现了我们伟大统帅毛主席最关心群众，最相信群众和最支持群众革命斗争的伟大气魄与胸怀。毛主席永远和人民心连心，这就是贯穿在这部影片中的一根红线。
    请看！当革命群众看到自己心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的时候，心情是怎样的激动呵！多少人欢呼万岁，多少人热泪盈眶！还有什么比这更幸福的呢？在这欢乐的海洋里，有千里迢迢步行来到北京，一心想见毛主席的红卫兵小将，当他们终于见到了日夜思念的毛主席时，怎能不激动得热泪盈眶？在这欢乐的海洋里，有曾被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打成“反革命”、“假左派，真右派”的革命闯将。他们在资产阶级反动路线一手制造的“黑云压城城欲摧”的日子里，日夜默念着：“抬头仰望北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”。如今，他们见到了日夜思念的毛主席，怎能不一千遍一万遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    “我们要见毛主席！我们要见毛主席！”革命群众怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，一遍又一遍地喊着。毛主席最理解革命群众的心情，他老人家答应了群众的要求。他满面笑容地和我们亲切握手，向我们招手致意。我们有多少话要向毛主席说啊！千言万语，并成一句话，就是：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    夜晚，当节日的焰火腾空而起时，毛主席又一次来到我们中间。他老人家不顾一天的劳累，和我们一起席地而坐，观看五彩缤纷的礼花。毛主席啊，毛主席！您最关心我们，最信任我们！您永远和我们在一起！
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们伟大的领袖毛主席最相信群众，最尊重群众。过去，他领导着我们越过了无数激流险滩，克服了种种艰难困苦，使我们的革命和建设取得了伟大的胜利。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他又率领着我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派冲锋陷阵，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派完全违反毛泽东思想，站在同人民群众相对立的地位。就是他，大力吹捧把义和团革命群众诬蔑为“犹如疯魔”的反动影片《清宫秘史》；在社会主义教育运动中，推行形“左”实右的反动路线的，是他；在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，勾结另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，制定并推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，疯狂镇压革命群众和革命干部的，还是他。他的所作所为，何其毒也！
    当前形势大好，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大的胜利。让我们高举起革命的批判旗帜，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的高潮！
