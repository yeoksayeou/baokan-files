The Longjing Tea Region in Xihu Commune, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, has begun picking "Pre-Qingming Tea."

The famous Longjing tea produced by Xihu Commune is renowned for its excellent color, aroma, and taste, enjoying a high reputation in China. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this commune have been seizing the revolutionary initiative and promoting production. They have done a better job of winter tea garden cultivation and management than in previous years, and have applied more base fertilizer. This spring, the tea buds have emerged earlier, more uniformly, and more robustly. Recently, the commune members of the main Longjing tea production areas such as Meijiawu, Longjing, and Shuangfeng have been seizing the opportunity to apply top dressing to promote bud growth, weed the tea gardens, and pick the "Pre-Qingming Tea" despite the rain.

    龙井茶区开始采摘明前茶
    浙江杭州西湖公社龙井茶区开始采摘“明前茶”。
    西湖公社出产的龙井名茶，色、香、味都好，在我国享有很高的声誉。这个公社的贫下中农在无产阶级文化大革命中，抓革命，促生产，使冬季茶园培育管理工作做得比往年好，基肥施得比往年足。今年春天，茶芽出得早，出得齐，出得壮。最近，龙井茶集中产区梅家坞、龙井、双峰等大队的社员，正在抓紧时机，冒雨赶施催芽肥，赶锄茶园青草，赶采“明前茶”。（据新华社讯）
