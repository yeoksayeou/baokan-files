The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Association today issued a statement on the bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" held in Beirut, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's brazen staging of an illegal and divisive bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut, even going so far as to establish a bogus Afro-Asian Writers' Standing Committee.

The statement said that for many years, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines within the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement. The vast majority of Afro-Asian writers and Afro-Asian peoples have consistently adhered to a revolutionary line of opposing imperialism led by the United States, both old and new colonialism, and firmly supporting the national liberation struggles of the Afro-Asian peoples. This line has greatly promoted the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Afro-Asian writers and peoples. However, the Soviet revisionists who have infiltrated the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement have been striving to promote a line of public capitulation to U.S. imperialism, sabotage of the Afro-Asian writers' movement, and betrayal of the revolutionary cause of Afro-Asian people's unity and anti-imperialism. However, in the face of strong opposition and resistance from the vast majority of Afro-Asian writers and Afro-Asian peoples, the Soviet revisionists have repeatedly suffered shameful defeats.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces..." This time, the Soviet revisionists' manipulation of the bogus "Third Conference" in Beirut further openly splits the Afro-Asian writers' movement, indicating their desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces of Afro-Asia, once again exposing their counter-revolutionary nature of false anti-imperialism, true capitulation, false support, true betrayal, false unity, and true division, and their traitorous face as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible." The Afro-Asian writers' movement, which insists on the just cause of unity and anti-imperialism, will become even more united and stronger after the Soviet revisionists split off, and will advance victoriously along the revolutionary line of unity and anti-imperialism.

The statement said that we are very honored to see that revolutionary writers from Afro-Asia all regard Beijing as a bastion of world revolution and enthusiastically express their desire to participate in the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement finally expressed that, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese writers and the Chinese people, who are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will, together with revolutionary and progressive Afro-Asian writers, under the banner of revolution against imperialism led by the United States and all its accomplices, contribute our greatest efforts to the successful convening of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in Beijing, and to the development and strengthening of the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the cause of Afro-Asian people's unity and anti-imperialism.

    我亚非团结会强烈谴责苏修导演亚非作家伪“三大”丑剧
    苏修分裂投降路线遭到可耻失败
    据新华社七日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表了关于贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团悍然在贝鲁特导演了一场非法的、分裂的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的丑剧，甚至成立了伪亚非作家常设局。
    声明说，多年来，在亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结运动中，一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。广大的亚非作家和亚非人民一贯坚决奉行反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义、坚决支持亚非人民民族解放斗争的革命路线。这条路线大大地促进了亚非作家和亚非人民的团结反帝事业。而混入亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结运动中的苏联修正主义者，则竭力推行一条公开投靠美帝、破坏亚非作家运动、出卖亚非人民团结反帝革命事业的分裂投降路线。但是，在广大的亚非作家和亚非人民的强烈反对和抵制下，苏联修正主义者不断地遭到可耻的失败。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，……”这次苏联修正主义者操纵贝鲁特伪“三大”进一步公开分裂亚非作家运动，正表明它向亚非革命力量进行绝望的挣扎，再一次暴露了它假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的反革命本质和充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的叛徒嘴脸。毛泽东主席说：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”坚持团结反帝正义事业的亚非作家运动在苏联分裂出去之后，必将使自己的队伍更加团结，更加壮大，沿着团结反帝的革命路线胜利前进。
    声明说，我们非常荣幸地看到亚非的革命作家都把北京看成是世界革命的堡垒，热情地表示要参加今年在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会。
    声明最后表示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、正在进行史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的中国作家和中国人民将和革命的、进步的亚非作家一道，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其一切帮凶的革命旗帜下，为北京第三届亚非作家大会的胜利召开，为亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结反帝事业的发展和壮大，贡献出我们最大的力量。
