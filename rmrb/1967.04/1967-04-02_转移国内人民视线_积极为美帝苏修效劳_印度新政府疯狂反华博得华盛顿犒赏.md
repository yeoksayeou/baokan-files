The new government of India, upon taking office, has actively collaborated with the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique to launch a series of vicious attacks against China, slandering and defaming our country.

Following the Indian President's malicious speech attacking China at the opening of the parliament, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on March 27 also slandered the Chinese government for "continuously provoking" India.

Foreign Minister Chagla, on the second day of the new government's tenure, began spouting anti-China fallacies, and subsequently in parliament, he repeatedly launched vicious slanders against China. It is well known that the Indian government is still occupying a large portion of Chinese territory. Indian troops invaded Chinese territory 73 times in the past year, and Indian aircraft violated Chinese airspace 71 times. However, Chagla not only denied these ironclad facts of Indian aggression against China but also attempted to confuse the issue by reversing black and white. He falsely accused China of "large-scale aggression" against India, claiming that China "illegally occupies approximately 14,500 square miles of Indian territory" and that in 1966, China "invaded" India multiple times, "constantly threatening" India. He then openly threatened and attempted to launch another large-scale invasion of China, saying, "We hope and pray that the day will come when we can recover the territory now under illegal Chinese occupation." He blamed the serious economic difficulties caused by the Indian reactionary government's endless exploitation of the Indian people and unlimited military buildup on the so-called "Chinese threat," using this to divert the Indian people's strong anger against Indian reactionary rule. Chagla also rudely interfered in China's internal affairs, launching vicious attacks and slanders against the Cultural Revolution in China's Tibet region. He openly declared that India would continue to support the so-called "basic rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people" (in reality, referring to the Tibetan serf owners who are accustomed to eating human hearts and gouging out human eyes), which is actually an open incitement and support for the Tibetan serf owners to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. Chagla also openly shouted in the parliament that he would provide "all conveniences and comforts" for the Tibetan traitor Dalai Lama, who is being raised by them, to engage in anti-China activities abroad. The Indian reactionary government attempts to use this to provoke friendly relations between China and relevant countries.

The newly appointed Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai, on March 28, also viciously slandered China and Pakistan as "aggressors" in the parliament. While expressing "concern" and "grief" over the current economic situation in India, which is facing soaring prices and declining production, he shouted that to "teach China and Pakistan a lesson," the enormous military budget of 9.69 billion rupees, which is nearly one-third of the total budget for 1967-1968, cannot be reduced, and "if necessary, more money must be raised at any cost." It is clear that Desai is using the so-called "aggression" by China and Pakistan to find an excuse for the Indian reactionary government to further exploit the people and prepare for war in the face of India's severe economic difficulties.

The new Indian government has been so eager to attack China since taking office, which has won the applause and generous rewards from U.S. imperialism. The U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles, on March 29, praised the election of the Indian Prime Minister and the composition of the cabinet as "the best and most vigorous democracy." The U.S. has repeatedly given money and grain to the new Indian government. According to the Indian News Agency, on March 14, the day after the new Indian government took office, the U.S. government signed an agreement with the Indian government to provide a loan of 2.884 billion rupees. From the day the new Indian government took office to March 28, two additional loans totaling 3.5 billion rupees were handed over to the Indian government. In addition, the U.S. Senate on the 16th also agreed to provide India with 300 million tons of grain and $25 million in "emergency grain relief funds."

### 转移国内人民视线　积极为美帝苏修效劳  印度新政府疯狂反华博得华盛顿犒赏

    转移国内人民视线　积极为美帝苏修效劳
    印度新政府疯狂反华博得华盛顿犒赏
    新华社一日讯　新德里消息：印度新政府一上台就积极配合美帝和苏修领导集团大肆反华，接连不断地对中国进行污蔑和攻击。
    继印度总统在议会开幕时发表恶毒攻击中国的演说之后，印度总理英迪拉·甘地在三月二十七日也污蔑中国政府向印度“连续地挑衅”。
    外交部长查格拉在新政府上台第二天就发表反华谬论，接着又在议会接连不断地恶毒污蔑中国。众所周知，印度政府现在还侵占着中国的大片领土，印度军队在去年侵犯中国领土达七十三起，飞机侵犯中国领空七十一架次。但是查格拉不但对这些印度侵略中国的铁的事实抵赖得一干二净，还妄想用颠倒黑白的滥调混淆视听。他反诬中国对印度“进行了大规模的侵略”，说什么中国“非法占领了大约一万四千五百平方英里印度领土”，一九六六年又多次“入侵”印度，“始终威胁”印度。接着他就公然威胁，妄图再次大规模侵略中国，说什么：“我们希望和祈祷我们将能够收回现在在中国非法占领下的领土的这天将会到来。”他把印度反动政府长期敲骨吸髓地压榨印度人民、无限地扩军备战所造成的严重经济困难，硬说成是所谓“中国的威胁”造成的，以此来转移印度人民对印度反动统治的强烈愤怒。查格拉还粗暴干涉中国内政，公然对中国西藏地区的文化大革命进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑，公然扬言印度将继续支持恢复所谓“西藏人民”（注：实际上是指的惯于吃人心、挖人眼的西藏农奴主）的“基本权利和自由”的行动，这实际上是公然策动和支持西藏农奴主进行反革命复辟。查格拉还在议会公然叫嚷要给受它豢养的西藏叛徒达赖去外国进行反华活动以“一切便利和舒适”。印度反动政府妄图以此挑拨中国同有关国家的友好关系。
    新上台的印度副总理兼财政部长德赛，三月二十八日也在议会恶毒地污蔑中国和巴基斯坦为“侵略者”。他一面对目前印度面临的物价飞涨、生产减退的经济局面表示“忧虑”和“苦恼”，一面却叫嚷为了让中国和巴基斯坦“接受教训”，高达九十六亿九千万卢比、差不多占一九六七——一九六八年总预算支出三分之一的庞大军事预算不能缩减，“必要的话，还要不惜任何代价搞到更多的钱”。很明显，德赛这样做，是在印度严重的经济困难情况下，用所谓的中国、巴基斯坦“侵略”，为印度反动政府加紧压榨人民、扩军备战找出借口。
    印度新政府上台后连续如此卖力地反华，博得了美帝国主义的喝采和重金犒赏。美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯三月二十九日吹捧印度总理的选举和内阁的组成是“最好的、最有生命力的民主”。美国对印度新政府一再给钱给粮。据印度新闻处报道，美国政府三月十四日即印度新政府上台的第二天，就同印度政府签订协定，答应给印度二十八亿八千四百万卢比的贷款。在印度新政府上台后到三月二十八日为止，又把两笔共计三十五亿卢比的贷款交给印度政府。此外，美国参议院在十六日还同意给印度政府三百万吨粮食和两千五百万美元的“粮食紧急救济款”。
