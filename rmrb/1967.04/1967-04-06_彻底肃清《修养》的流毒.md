The editorial of the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine sounded the battle cry to open fire on the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Before the echo of the call to arms had faded, Comrade Chen Boda's article exploded like a bomb in the black command center of the bourgeoisie. Comrade Chen Boda's article is written so well!

The editorial of *Red Flag* and Comrade Chen Boda's article mark the beginning of a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a stage of concentrating our targets and firepower to launch a fierce attack on the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. We must thoroughly criticize the anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought book "Self-Cultivation," seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party politically and ideologically, and truly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a thorough conclusion!

Chairman Mao instructs us: "You must pay attention to state affairs." What is the most important state affair? It is to resolutely remove the time bomb beside Chairman Mao, to pull down the Chinese Khrushchev, this is the most important state affair. Chairman Mao has deeply summarized the historical experience of the international communist movement, especially the lessons of the Soviet Union's proletarian dictatorship degenerating into bourgeois dictatorship. These lessons, in a nutshell, are that Khrushchev-style individual careerists have usurped the highest leadership of the Party and the state.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. The most important aspect of state power is who holds the highest leadership of the Party and the state. A certain person has occupied key Party and government positions for more than twenty years. His "Self-Cultivation" has poisoned the Party, the country, and the world. He is the most dangerous Khrushchev-style conspirator and careerist threatening our country's proletarian dictatorship. We must concentrate our targets and, from a class standpoint, thoroughly criticize his "Self-Cultivation." This is a matter of whether our Party and state will or will not produce revisionism. If we only seize his power organizationally and remove his position, this is not enough. The most important thing is to seize power from him politically and ideologically, to completely criticize and expose "Self-Cultivation," this anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed, and thoroughly eliminate all its evil influences. In 1944, Chairman Mao, in summarizing the lessons of our Party's history of criticizing opportunist lines, said that the past criticisms "did not make the cadres thoroughly understand the reasons for the errors at that time, the environment, and the detailed methods to correct these errors, so they might commit similar errors again." If we do not completely criticize and expose a certain person politically and ideologically, then under certain political climate conditions, they will rise again from the ashes, or if we pull down one certain person, another certain person will emerge.

"Self-Cultivation" is the theoretical basis of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party's anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. It is the theoretical basis of the bourgeois reactionary line. "Self-Cultivation" is completely deceitful; it does not want revolution but only "self-cultivation," it does not want proletarian dictatorship but bourgeois dictatorship. In criticizing "Self-Cultivation," we must firmly grasp this crucial issue. A certain person's publication of "Self-Cultivation" in 1939 and its reprinting in 1962 were both for his plot to usurp the Party and the government to prepare public opinion. Those who are poisoned by "Self-Cultivation" will forget about state power in the face of class enemy attacks and engage in individual idealist "self-cultivation." The reason why a certain person in "Self-Cultivation" vigorously advocates slavery and advocates the subordination of subordinates to superiors across classes is to serve his plot to restore capitalism.

Comrades of the revolutionary masses, concentrate your targets and firepower, launch a fierce attack on the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and thoroughly criticize "Self-Cultivation." This is the great direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, this is the only correct path to thoroughly bury the bourgeois reactionary line. A certain person, relying on his usurped position and the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" he meticulously concocted, has long been promoting a bourgeois reactionary line that opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, poisoning quite a number of Party members and cadres. Concentrate your firepower, aim directly at this number one capitalist-roader within the Party, aim directly at "Self-Cultivation," so that the revolutionary masses and the broad masses of cadres and people who have been deceived can see clearly: who is the backstage boss of Chinese revisionism, who is the formulator and promoter of the bourgeois reactionary line, who is the chief culprit sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This will also strengthen their unity, form a vast army of cultural revolutionaries, and strive together to thoroughly complete the tasks of one struggle, two lines, and three changes!

    彻底肃清《修养》的流毒
    北京师范大学　《井冈山》报编辑部
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员的文章吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的战斗号角。号声未落，戚本禹同志的文章就象一颗炸弹在资产阶级黑司令部里爆炸了。戚本禹同志的文章写得何其好啊！
    《红旗》评论员的文章和戚本禹同志的文章标志着无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段，即集中目标，集中火力，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，彻底批判反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的《修养》，从政治上、思想上向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把无产阶级文化大革命真正搞深搞透搞彻底！
    毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事”。什么是最大的国家大事呢？坚决挖掉毛主席身边的定时炸弹，把中国的赫鲁晓夫式的人物拉下马，这就是最大的国家大事。毛主席深刻地总结了国际共产主义运动的历史经验，特别是总结了苏联无产阶级专政蜕变为资产阶级专政的教训。这些教训，集中到一点，就是赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家篡夺了党和国家的最高领导权。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。政权问题，最重要的是党和国家的最高领导权掌握在什么人手里的问题。某某人窃踞党政要职二十余年，他的《修养》流毒党内外、国内外。他是威胁我国无产阶级专政最危险的赫鲁晓夫式的阴谋家、野心家。集中目标，用阶级观点彻底批判他的《修养》，乃是关系到我们党和国家出不出修正主义的大问题。如果只在组织上夺他的权，罢他们的官，这是不够的。最重要的是从政治上、思想上夺权，把《修养》这株反毛泽东思想的大毒草批倒批臭，彻底肃清它的一切恶劣影响。一九四四年，毛主席在总结我党历史上批判机会主义路线的教训时说，过去的批判，“没有使干部在思想上彻底了解当时错误的原因，环境和改正此种错误的详细办法，以致后来又可能重犯同类性质的错误”。如果我们不把某某人从政治上、思想上彻底批倒批臭，那么在一定的政治气候条件下，他们就会死灰复燃，或者倒了一个某某人，还会出另一个某某人。
    《修养》是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的理论基础，是资产阶级反动路线的理论基础。《修养》完全是欺人之谈，它不要革命，只要“修养”，不要无产阶级专政而要资产阶级专政。批判《修养》，一定要狠狠抓住这个要害问题。某某人在一九三九年出版和一九六二年再版《修养》都是为他篡党篡政作舆论准备的。中了《修养》的毒，就会在阶级敌人进攻的面前忘记政权而去搞个人的唯心的“修养”。某某人在《修养》中所以要竭力提倡奴隶主义，提倡超阶级的“下级服从上级”，就是为他阴谋实行资本主义复辟服务的。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，集中目标，集中火力，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，彻底批判《修养》，这是毛主席给我们指出的大方向，这是彻底埋葬资产阶级反动路线的唯一正确的道路。某某人凭借他所窃踞的地位和他精心炮制的大毒草《修养》，长期来推行了一条与毛主席革命路线相对抗的资产阶级反动路线，毒害了相当多的党员和干部。集中火力，矛头直指这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，直指《修养》，就能使无产阶级革命派和广大受蒙蔽的干部和群众看清：谁是中国修正主义的总后台，谁是资产阶级反动路线的制订者和推行者，谁是破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首。从而也就会加强他们之间的团结，组成千千万万浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，为彻底完成一斗二批三改的任务而共同奋斗！
