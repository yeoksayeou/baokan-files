Do Not Dress Up the Lackey as a Hero

—Exposing the So-Called “Patriotic” Heroine, Empress Dowager Cixi

Chairman Mao has pointed out: The film *The Last Days of the Dynasty*, which some people say is patriotic, I say is traitorous, thoroughly traitorous.

The thoroughly traitorous thought of *The Last Days of the Dynasty* is mainly expressed through Cixi. The reactionary filmmakers, driven by their counter-revolutionary political needs, deliberately distorted and falsified history, glorifying Cixi, portraying her as a woman who cares deeply for the country and its people, is steadfast and unyielding, full of rebellious and sacrificial spirit. Through the mouth of Guangxu, they fawn over her: “If everyone in China were like you, China would be saved.” She also pretends to boast: “I have never thought of myself.” Finally, when imperialists invaded Beijing, she refused to flee with the Empress Dowager and jumped into a well, appearing to be a heroine who sacrificed herself for the country!

This is a trick, a magic show that must be exposed. To thoroughly expose the thoroughly traitorous nature of *The Last Days of the Dynasty* and the ugly soul and evil intentions of those who praised this film, the number one capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must tear off the mask of the so-called “patriotic” heroine Cixi and reveal her true face as an imperialist lackey.

What Country Does She Love?

Chairman Mao often teaches us: We must conduct concrete analysis of everything, which is the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism. This also applies to the concept of “patriotism.” As early as the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Mao pointed out: “The specific content of patriotism depends on the historical conditions under which it is manifested. There is the patriotism of the Japanese invaders and Hitler, and there is our patriotism. Communists must resolutely oppose the so-called patriotism of the Japanese invaders and Hitler.” However, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party sings a different tune, claiming that “true patriotism is the love for one’s own country, people, language, and the excellent traditions of one’s own nation that have been passed down for thousands of years.” This is pure bourgeois politician talk, the language of a charlatan! Abandoning class analysis, stripping away the specific content of class and class struggle, and talking about “the country and people that have been passed down for thousands of years,” “the excellent traditions of one’s own nation,” and so on, isn’t this just bourgeois deception?

Let us look at the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty*, which is highly praised by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, to see what kind of patriotism he is advocating. What kind of country does his patriotic heroine Cixi love?

Cixi was Guangxu’s favorite concubine, an important figure who could influence Guangxu. Sensing the decline of the feudal ruling class, she was deeply worried about the “Great Qing Dynasty” that was “declining day by day.” She fantasized about reforming and “implementing new policies” to maintain the shaky feudal rule. For this, she was willing to recognize the enemy as her father, advising Guangxu to rely on the power of imperialism to “help the Emperor regain the throne and restore the court.”

The issue is clear: Cixi is not only a die-hard monarchist, a loyal guardian of the interests of the reactionary ruling class, but also an agent of imperialism, a complete lackey. The specific content of her so-called patriotism is to sell herself to imperialism, seeking “forgiveness” and “help” to maintain the corrupt “Great Qing Dynasty.”

Such a complete lackey is portrayed by the filmmakers as a “patriotic” heroine. Why did they rush to release this film on the eve of national liberation?

At that time, the People’s Liberation War had achieved decisive victories, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the running dogs of American imperialism, was in a state of turmoil. Comparing the film with reality, everyone would understand: Who is the Emperor Guangxu in the film? It refers to Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism! What is the “Great Qing Dynasty”? It refers to the Chiang Kai-shek regime! And Cixi, as an agent of imperialism, enthusiastically dances to the tune of the American *White Paper*, advising the Chiang Kai-shek regime, boosting morale, and urging them to further sell themselves to American imperialism to gain “help” and “restore the court.” The so-called patriotism embodied by Cixi in the film is, in essence, standing on the side of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, catering to the needs of American imperialism’s invasion of China, and doing everything possible to maintain the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. This is thorough and complete treachery.

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party praises such a reactionary, thoroughly traitorous film as a “patriotic” film and sings the praises of imperialist agents as “patriotic” heroes. This is a complete exposure of his counter-revolutionary face. What he loves is not something else, but the reactionary rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie in China, the tool of American imperialism’s invasion, enslavement, and exploitation of the Chinese people—the Chiang Kai-shek regime!

Exposing the Lackey’s True Face

Imperialism is the first and most vicious enemy of the Chinese people. True patriotism must be linked with the revolutionary struggle against imperialist aggression. When Chairman Mao talks about patriotism, he especially emphasizes, “Our slogan is to defend the motherland and fight against the invaders.” However, the so-called “patriotic” heroes praised by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, such as Cixi, when the Chinese nation is suffering from aggression, their imperialist worship, admiration, and servility are fully exposed, revealing a completely servile and lackey-like face.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Imperialist aggression shattered the Chinese people’s dream of learning from the West.” “The bourgeois republic that exists in foreign countries cannot exist in China because China is a country oppressed by imperialism.” In the film, Cixi and her ilk are infatuated with the bourgeois republic, admiring bourgeois “civilization.” They are fascinated by “Western toys,” yearning for the capitalist system, saying that after the Meiji Emperor’s reforms in Japan, “their country has become stronger day by day,” and if China also reforms like this, “in less than thirty years, it can become the richest and strongest country in the world!” Using such flattering and disgusting language to praise the evil capitalist system is truly nauseating!

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Imperialism is very vicious,” meaning its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher’s knives; they will never become Buddhas until their demise. He calls on us to “abandon illusions and prepare for struggle.” Cixi and her ilk eagerly beautify imperialism, spreading all kinds of illusions about imperialism, even regarding imperialism as a savior, saying, “I believe that the various countries will not only not harm the Emperor but will also help the Emperor regain the throne and restore the court.” Look, imperialism is not aggressive by nature but benevolent, not cruel but kind, truly deserving of applause and welcome. Pfft! This is recognizing the enemy as a father, inviting the wolf into the house, betraying national interests, and thoroughly traitorous nonsense!

Chairman Mao also teaches us: In the face of the imperialist beast, revolutionary people must not have the slightest cowardice. Cixi and her ilk spread pessimism and defeatism, willingly becoming slaves and traitors. As soon as they hear that imperialism is waging war against China, Cixi panics, saying, “Although the Japanese country is small, now they are rich and strong, we may not be able to defeat them!” Guangxu sings the tune of defeatism even higher, saying, “We are likely to be defeated,” “It seems that the country is about to perish!” This wailing of the declining class is the foundation of their traitorous thoughts. Therefore, as soon as the guns of the Eight-Nation Alliance fire, they immediately turn from fear to deciding to surrender. Cixi tells Guangxu, “This is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Once the Empress Dowager leaves, the world will be yours again!” However, everyone knows that at this time, the “world” has already fallen into the hands of imperialism. What can Cixi and Guangxu do if they do not leave? They can only be traitorous puppet emperors!

Please ask, is there any trace of patriotism left in Cixi? No, there is none. There is only the stench of lackeyism, thorough and complete treachery, barefaced treachery. “If everyone were like her,” China would have long become a colony of imperialism.

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party’s praise for the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty* and the singing of praises for the lackeys of imperialism like Cixi is not accidental. He and Cixi and her ilk are of the same ilk.

Like Cixi and her ilk, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is a sufferer of imperialist worship, a die-hard “Westernization enthusiast.” He covets Western bourgeois civilization and repeatedly advocates for “unwavering” learning from the West. In his view, Chinese people are no good at anything, and “Western toys” are all good. As late as 1963, he still praised the Meiji Restoration for cultivating “such a spirit of diligence and strength in Japan’s bourgeoisie,” saying, “We have fought more than a hundred battles and lost, so we think Chinese people are no good, losing confidence in ourselves, saying Westerners are good, and Chinese are bad. Later, we learned from Westerners, and as soon as we learned, we made progress.” What a “progress”! Does this self-proclaimed “Marxist theorist” “great man” not know that Chairman Mao has said, “Imperialist aggression shattered the Chinese people’s dream of learning from the West,” “The Chinese people have learned a lot from the West, but it does not work”? Obviously not. Here, he is openly opposing Chairman Mao’s instructions, openly beautifying Western bourgeoisie and imperialism.

Like Cixi and her ilk, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party has illusions about imperialism, showing a flattering attitude. Just when Chairman Mao calls on the people to “abandon illusions and prepare for struggle,” he publishes an article in the newspaper, appealing for peace to the U.S. government, “thanking” American imperialism for “helping” China’s war of resistance, “hoping” that American imperialism will “sympathize” with China’s peaceful cause! As late as November 1963, he still loudly proclaimed that “even within the U.S. ruling class, there are some people with clearer heads,” “I don’t think the U.S. will necessarily attack China,” deceiving and lulling the revolutionary people, completely playing the shameful role of an imperialist agent!

Like Cixi and her ilk, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party eagerly praises the “strength” of imperialism, exaggerating the “power” of imperialism, frightening the Chinese people, claiming that “the U.S. has strong power, it is the strongest country in the world,” even publicly declaring: “The U.S. must find compradors in China, and we can also be compradors for them!” What a servile face! It is truly shameful and despicable!

Please ask, is there any trace of patriotism left in this “great man” who talks about patriotism? No, there is none. There is only the stench of lackeyism, thorough and complete treachery, barefaced treachery. “If everyone were like him,” China’s future would be unthinkable!

Do Not Distort History, Beautify Traitors

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party’s eagerness to praise the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty*, openly calling thorough treachery “patriotism,” and singing the praises of imperialist agents, lackeys, and national traitors as “patriotic” heroes has its class and historical roots.

Originally, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party has been a practitioner and propagandist of class and national capitulationism in history. Just when the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, was fighting a life-and-death battle against Japanese imperialist invaders, he was talking about “sacrificing some party work to preserve comrades” in his book *Self-Cultivation*, saying that life is “a constant struggle with death,” and so on. These fallacies are similar to Khrushchev’s philosophy of life, the philosophy of traitors, “If the head is lost, what use is the principle?” It is under the guidance of such ugly thoughts that, on the eve of the full-scale outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he instructed his group of party comrades in prison to publicly issue an anti-communist statement, surrender, and become shameful traitors, class and national criminals! And he, the ringleader of this group of traitors.

To cover up this major historical crime, deceive the party, and deceive the people, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party has racked his brains, fabricating all kinds of shameless lies, beautifying traitors, and evading responsibility.

First, he claims: Betraying the party and surrendering to the enemy is to preserve revolutionary forces. What a “preservation of revolutionary forces”! Since they have already betrayed the party and surrendered to the enemy, what kind of “revolutionary forces” are they?! Politics is the commander, the soul. “Without correct political views, it is like having no soul.” These shameful traitors who have sold the souls of Communist Party members are, at best, walking corpses! They are not “revolutionary forces” at all but termites in the revolutionary ranks, false revolutionaries, counter-revolutionary forces!

Second, he claims: Issuing the “anti-communist statement” is just a formality, a procedure. Then let us look at its “content”! The traitors wrote in the “anti-communist statement”: “We have sincerely repented and are willing to follow the government’s leadership, resolutely oppose communism, and be loyal citizens,” and expressed that “in the future, we will not participate in any Communist Party organization or other subversive activities (???), and we hope that young people will not be deceived by them in the future,” and so on. Is this just “a formality”? These filthy words published in the most reactionary newspapers designated by the enemy are not difficult to imagine in terms of their evil influence. What is just “a formality”? This is self-deception and deception of others! Abandoning the great ideal of the proletarian revolution, betraying the great cause of national liberation, willingly entering the embrace of imperialism and its running dogs, this is the essence of their traitorous deeds, isn’t it?

Third, he claims: The traitors are loyal to the enemy and also loyal to the party. This is absurd. This can only show that the so-called “party” of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is one with the enemy; it can only show that his “party” is the party of reactionaries, traitors, completely incompatible with our great leader Mao Zedong’s great Communist Party of China!

All kinds of lies cannot be self-consistent, but instead, they further expose his ugly face as the ringleader of this group of traitors.

For a long time, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party has used his authority to deceive heaven and earth, distort history, and do everything possible to cover up his traitorous party comrades, dressing them up as “old revolutionaries” and placing them in key positions in party, government, and military departments; while for those who maintain revolutionary integrity and dare to fight against the enemy, true revolutionary comrades, he treats them as enemies, doing his utmost to exclude, strike, and frame them, even expelling them from the party, determined to kill them.

In dealing with the issue of the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty*, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is performing a play of seeking help from the past, using their names, slogans, and costumes to advocate for capitalism:

He praises the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty* and sings the praises of the imperialist lackeys like Cixi, precisely to use their names, language, and costumes to express his own ideals and wishes, advocating his philosophy of being a comprador, traitorous philosophy, advocating his philosophy of life, philosophy of surrender, philosophy of traitors, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

He praises the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty* and sings the praises of the imperialist lackeys like Cixi, precisely to use them to sing the praises of himself and his traitorous party comrades, dressing himself up as a “hero,” deceiving the party and the masses to gain their trust, consolidating and expanding his own power, and preparing organizationally for the day when he will seize the party, the army, and the government, restoring capitalism.

In short, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to use the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Dynasty* to strangle the newly born New China, “reverse” the historical wheel heading towards socialism, clear the way for the restoration of capitalism, and prepare in all aspects for a small group of individualist careerists and conspirators who have infiltrated the party to seize the party, the army, and the government.

“Human affairs are subject to change.” The development of history is not subject to the will of man. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his large and small lackeys were stripped of their disguises as “old revolutionaries,” revealing their true faces as traitors.

“It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength.” Let us raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, pursue victory, and thoroughly overthrow the small group of capitalist-roaders within the party, uproot the roots of revisionism, and let the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong illuminate the world!

    不许把洋奴打扮成英雄
    ——剥开所谓“爱国主义”英雄珍妃的画皮
    首都红代会中国人民大学“三红”文学兵团
    毛主席指出：《清宫秘史》，有人说是爱国主义的，我看是卖国主义的，彻底的卖国主义。
    《清宫秘史》的彻底的卖国主义思想，主要是通过珍妃表现出来的。这部反动影片的编制者，出于他们反革命的政治需要，肆意歪曲和篡改历史，美化珍妃，把她描写成忧国忧民、坚贞不屈、富有反抗精神和牺牲精神的人物，并通过光绪的口，肉麻地赞扬她：“要是全中国的人，人人都象你，中国就有救了。”她也故作姿态，自我吹嘘说：“从来就没有替自己打算过”！最后，在帝国主义入侵北京的时候，拒绝跟西太后逃走，投井自尽，俨然是一个以身殉国的英雄！
    这是骗人的魔术，是必须拆穿的西洋镜。为了彻底揭露《清宫秘史》的彻底的卖国主义实质，揭露为这部影片叫好的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶灵魂和险恶用心，我们必须撕下“爱国主义”英雄珍妃的画皮，还她以帝国主义洋奴才的本来面目。
    爱的是什么国？
    毛主席经常教导我们：对任何事物都要进行具体的分析，这是马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义的活的灵魂。对“爱国主义”这个概念，也必须进行具体分析。早在抗日战争初期，毛主席就曾指出：“爱国主义的具体内容，看在什么样的历史条件之下来决定。有日本侵略者和希特勒的‘爱国主义’，有我们的爱国主义。对于日本侵略者和希特勒的所谓‘爱国主义’，共产党员是必须坚决地反对的。”然而，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却大唱反调，胡说什么“真正的爱国主义乃是对于数千年来世代相传的自己祖国、自己人民、自己语言文字以及自己民族的优秀传统之热爱”。完全是资产阶级政客的腔调，江湖术士的语言！抛弃阶级分析的方法，抽掉阶级和阶级斗争的具体内容，而侈谈什么“数千年来世代相传的自己祖国”，“自己民族的优秀传统”等等，不是资产阶级骗人的鬼话又是什么呢？
    我们再从被党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大肆吹捧的反动影片《清宫秘史》里，看看他所鼓吹的“爱国主义”是什么货色？他的“爱国主义”英雄珍妃之流究竟爱的是什么国？
    珍妃是光绪的宠妃，是能够左右光绪的一个重要人物。因为敏感到封建统治阶级的没落，她为“一天一天在衰败下去”的“大清国”无限忧虑。她幻想通过变法，“推行新政”，维护摇摇欲坠的封建统治。为此，她不惜认贼作父，向光绪献计，想凭借帝国主义的势力来“帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。
    问题很清楚，珍妃不仅是一个地地道道的保皇党，反动统治阶级的阶级利益的忠实卫士，而且是一个帝国主义的代理人，十足的洋奴才。她的所谓“爱国主义”的具体内容，就是卖身投靠帝国主义，取得“原谅”和“帮助”，以维护腐败不堪的“大清王朝”。
    这样一个十足的洋奴才，影片作者却颠倒黑白，把她打扮成一个“爱国主义”的英雄，而且在全国解放前夕急急忙忙地抛出来，究竟是为什么呢？
    当时，人民解放战争已经取得决定性胜利，美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派的统治正处在风雨飘摇之中，走狗在主子“帮助”下正在作垂死的挣扎。对照现实看电影，谁都会明白，影片中的光绪皇帝是谁呢？就是指美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石！“大清国”是什么呢？就是指的蒋家王朝！而珍妃则作为帝国主义的代理人，起劲地按照美国《白皮书》的调子跳舞，为蒋家王朝出谋献策，招魂打气，指使他们进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义，以取得“帮助”，“重振朝纲”。影片通过珍妃体现出来的所谓“爱国主义”的实质就是，站在帝国主义和国民党反动派的立场上，迎合美帝国主义侵略中国的需要，千方百计维持蒋家王朝的反动统治。这是彻头彻尾的卖国主义。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派把这样反动的、彻底的卖国主义影片吹捧为“爱国主义”影片，把帝国主义的代理人歌颂为“爱国”英雄，是他反革命面目的一次大暴露。他所爱的不是别的，而是大地主、大资产阶级在中国的反动统治，是美帝国主义侵略、奴役和榨取中国人民的御用工具——蒋家王朝！
    洋奴面目的大暴露
    帝国主义是中国人民第一个和最凶恶的敌人，真正的爱国主义必然同反对帝国主义侵略的革命斗争联系在一起。毛主席在讲到爱国主义的时候，特别提出，“我们的口号是为保卫祖国反对侵略者而战。”然而，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所吹捧的“爱国主义”英雄珍妃之流，在中华民族遭受侵略的时候，恐帝、崇帝、亲帝病恶性发作，充分暴露了一副奴颜婢膝的洋奴面目。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。”“资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。”影片中珍妃之流醉心于资产阶级共和国，崇拜资产阶级
  “文明”。他们对“洋玩艺儿”十分入迷，对资本主义制度心向神往，说什么日本“自明治皇帝维新之后，他们的国家已经一天一天的强盛起来了”，如果中国也照这样改革，“不到三十年，就可成为世界上最最富强的国家啦！”用这种谄媚的、肉麻的词句赞美万恶的资本主义制度，实在令人作呕！
    毛主席教导我们：“‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”他号召我们“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”。珍妃之流极力美化帝国主义，
    散布对帝国主义的种种幻想，甚至把帝国主义当作救星，说什么“我相信各国非但不会伤害皇上，还会帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。你看，帝国主义不是侵略成性，而是乐善好施，不是凶残暴戾，而是和蔼可亲，真该鼓掌欢迎了。呸！这是认贼作父，这是引狼入室，这是对民族利益的出卖，这是彻头彻尾的卖国主义谬论！
    毛主席还教导我们：在帝国主义野兽面前，革命的人民不可以有丝毫的怯懦。珍妃之流大肆散布悲观论、亡国论，心甘情愿做亡国奴、卖国贼。一听说帝国主义向中国开战，珍妃惊慌失措，说什么：“日本国虽小，可是现在他们国富民强，咱们不一定打得过他们呢！”光绪嘴里的亡国论的调子唱得更高，连说“咱们八成要打败”，“眼见得亡国就在眼前了！”这种没落阶级的哀鸣，正是其卖国主义的思想基础。因此，当八国联军的炮声一响，他们立刻由恐惧进而决心投降。珍妃对光绪说：“这是您千载一时的好机会，太后一走，这天下不又是您的了！”然而谁都明白，这时的“天下”，已经沦入帝国主义的魔掌，珍妃和光绪不走又能干什么呢？只能做卖国的儿皇帝罢了！
    请问，在珍妃身上，还有一点爱国主义的影子没有？没有，完全没有。有的尽是臭不可闻的洋奴气，彻头彻尾的卖国主义，赤裸裸的卖国主义。“要是人人都象”她，中国早已变成帝国主义的殖民地了。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，歌颂珍妃之流的洋奴才，不是偶然的。他和珍妃之流本来就是一路货。
    和珍妃之流一样，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是崇帝病的患者，地地道道的“洋务迷”。他垂涎于西方资产阶级文明，不断鼓吹要“坚定不移”地向西方“学习”。在他看来，中国人什么都不行，“洋玩艺儿”什么都是好的。直到一九六三年，他还赞美明治维新养成了日本资产阶级的“那么一股干劲，发奋图强的风气”，还说，“我们打了一百多年败仗，就认为中国人不行，丧失了对自己的信心，说西方人行，中国的不好。后来我们向西方人学习了，一学就有了进步。”好一个“一学就有了进步”！难道这位素以“马克思主义理论家”自命的“大人物”竟不知道毛主席说过“帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦”，“中国人向西方学得很不少，但是行不通”这样一些著名的论断吗？显然不是。在这里，他是在公开同毛主席的指示唱反调，公开美化西方资产阶级和帝国主义。
    和珍妃之流一样，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派对帝国主义充满幻想，一副媚态。正当毛主席号召人民“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”的时候，他在报纸上发表文章，向美国政府呼吁和平，“感谢”美帝国主义“帮助”中国抗战，“希望”美帝国主义“同情”中国的和平事业！直到一九六三年十一月，他还大肆宣传“就是在美国统治集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人”，“我看美国也不一定打中国”，以欺骗和麻痹革命人民，完全扮演了帝国主义代理人的可耻角色！
    和珍妃之流一样，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派极力吹嘘帝国主义的“强大”，夸大帝国主义的“力量”，吓唬中国人民，胡说什么“美国是有强大力量的，是世界上最强大的国家”，甚至公然宣称：“美国非要在中国找买办不可，我们也可以给他当买办”！一副奴才嘴脸！真是可耻，可恨！
    请问，在这位满口“爱国主义”的“大人物”身上，还有一点“爱国主义”的影子没有？没有，完全没有。有的尽是臭不可闻的洋奴气，彻头彻尾的卖国主义，赤裸裸的卖国主义。“要是人人都象”他，中国的前途早已不堪设想了！
    不许篡改历史，美化叛徒
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所以极力吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，公然把彻底的卖国主义说成是“爱国主义”，把帝国主义的代理人、奴才、民族败类当作“爱国”英雄，是有其阶级根源和历史根源的。
    原来，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在历史上就是阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的奉行者和吹鼓手。正当中华民族在中国共产党的领导下与日本帝国主义侵略者展开生死决战的时候，他在他那本《修养》中却大谈“牺牲党的一些工作保存同志”，还说什么人生“即是与死不断的斗争”，就是为了不死，等等，这些谬论与赫鲁晓夫的“脑袋丢了，原则还有什么用处？”的活命哲学、叛徒哲学，可以说是异曲同工。正是在这种丑恶思想的指导下，他在抗日战争全面爆发的前夕，指示他的一帮在狱中的党羽公开发表反共启事，自首变节，堕落为可耻的叛徒，阶级的和民族的罪人！而他，则是这群叛徒的罪魁祸首。
    为了掩盖这一重大的历史罪行，欺骗党，欺骗人民，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，挖空心思，编造了种种无耻的谎言，美化叛徒，开脱罪责。
    一曰：投敌叛党，变节自首，是为了保存革命力量。好一个“保存革命力量”！既然已经叛党，已经投敌，还算什么“革命力量”？！政治是统帅，是灵魂，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”这帮出卖了共产党员灵魂的可耻叛徒，即便活着，充其量不过是行尸走肉而已！他们根本不是什么“革命力量”，而是革命队伍中的蛀虫，是假革命，是反革命力量！
    二曰：发表“反共启事”，只是履行一个手续，是一种形式。那么就让我们看看它的“内容”吧！叛徒们在“反共启事”上写道：“现已诚心悔悟，愿在政府领导之下，坚决反共，作一忠实国民”，并表示“以后决不参加共产党组织及其他任何反动行为（！？），并希望有为青年俟后莫再受其煽惑”，如此等等。难道这只是“一种形式”吗？这些最肮脏的语言刊登在被指定的最反动的报纸上，其影响之恶劣，是不难想象的。什么只是“一种形式”，完全是自欺欺人！抛弃无产阶级革命的伟大理想，背叛民族解放斗争的伟大事业，心甘情愿投入帝国主义及其走狗的怀抱，这就是他们叛徒行径的本质，岂有他哉？
    三曰：叛徒们“对敌人忠实，对党也忠实”。真是荒谬绝伦。这只能说明党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的所谓“党”，同敌人是一码事，是二位一体；只能说明他的“党”就是反动派的党，卖国贼的党，同我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下的伟大的中国共产党是水火不相容的！
    种种谎言都不能自圆其说，相反越描越黑，进一步暴露了他作为这帮叛徒的总头目的丑恶嘴脸。
    长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，利用职权，瞒天过海，篡改历史，千方百计包庇他的叛徒党羽，把他们一个个打扮成“老革命”的模样，安插到党、政、军各重要部门和重要岗位；而对于保持革命节操、勇于同敌人进行斗争的真正的革命同志，却视如寇仇，极尽排斥、打击、陷害之能事，以至于开除党籍，必欲置之死地而后快。
    在对待反动影片《清宫秘史》的问题上，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在作着一种求助于过去的亡灵，借用他们的名字、口号和服装来宣扬资本主义的表演：
    他吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，歌颂帝国主义的奴才珍妃之流，正是要借用他们的名字、语言和服装，表达他自己的理想和愿望，宣传他的甘当买办的哲学、卖国主义哲学，宣传他的活命哲学、投降哲学、叛徒哲学，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    他吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，歌颂帝国主义的奴才珍妃之流，正是要通过他们，歌颂他自己以及他的叛徒党羽，把自己装扮成“英雄”，骗取党和群众的信任，以巩固和扩大自己的势力，为将来某一天篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义作组织准备。
    总之，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派企图通过反动影片《清宫秘史》，扼杀刚刚诞生的新中国，“扭转”走向社会主义的历史车轮，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，为一小撮钻进党内的个人主义野心家和阴谋家篡党、篡军、篡政作各方面的准备。
      “人间正道是沧桑”。历史的发展是不以人的意志为转移的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他的大小的娄罗党羽，一个个被剥去了“老革命”的伪装，露出了叛徒的真面目。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，让我们高举革命的批判旗帜，乘胜追击，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒，把修正主义的根子彻底挖掉，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照大地！
