Comrades and fellow revolutionaries in the proletarian revolutionary ranks, comrades in the People's Liberation Army, and young Red Guards:

The long-awaited Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has now been established.

The preparatory work for the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been carried out under the intimate care of our great leader Chairman Mao. At this moment when the people of the entire city of Beijing are jubilant, let us all together sincerely wish our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long live Chairman Mao!

Today, Premier Zhou Enlai and all the comrades of the Central Cultural Revolution Group have attended our meeting. Let us extend a warm welcome to them! Let us salute them with proletarian revolutionary greetings!

During the preparatory work for the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," providing powerful support from all sides. Let us salute them with revolutionary greetings! We must learn from the People's Liberation Army!

The proletarian revolutionary ranks of Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong provinces and cities were the first to achieve great unity and implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They are our examples to learn from. Today, the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committees of these provinces and cities have come from afar to participate in our meeting and support us. Let us extend the warmest welcome and thanks to them!

The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is the result of the long and heroic struggle of the proletarian revolutionary ranks in the capital, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line, and fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line.

Beijing is where our great leader Chairman Mao resides, the location of the highest command of the proletariat. The boundless rays of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the entire world, illuminate all of China, and illuminate the great capital of our motherland. However, the old Beijing Municipal Committee, which was long controlled by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, under the protection and support of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, has always flown the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. They have fiercely opposed our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacked and belittled the great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This counter-revolutionary revisionist clique has always opposed Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle, advocated class reconciliation, spread the theory of the extinction of class struggle, opposed and sabotaged the socialist education movement in cities and countryside, protected the interests of the bourgeoisie. They have always opposed the prominence of proletarian politics, implemented the revisionist line in the work of industry, agriculture, commerce, finance, and education, and promoted the restoration of capitalism. They have always opposed the proletarian cultural revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and his comrades, using various propaganda tools under their control to spread revisionist poison and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In the revolution of Peking opera, dance drama, and symphony, they have obstructed and attacked Comrade Jiang Qing in every possible way. What is particularly infuriating is that they have repeatedly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize Wu Han and have remained inactive for a long time. After Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was published, they still did not allow Beijing's newspapers to reprint it or publish it as a separate edition, and they attacked the revolutionary comrades in Shanghai. They have always implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line of recruiting and using traitors, appointing trusted followers, promoting bad elements, protecting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and suppressing the proletarian revolutionary ranks. They have always blocked the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, turning Beijing into an "impenetrable fortress" independent kingdom, attempting to turn Beijing into a base for their counter-revolutionary restoration. This counter-revolutionary revisionist clique is a great bully riding on the heads of the broad masses of the people in Beijing, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

The head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee often boasted among the cadres, creating public opinion for usurping the Party and the country. In fact, the main responsible person of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, has always been a thoroughgoing capitulationist and an agent of the bourgeoisie within our Party.

During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, this counter-revolutionary revisionist implemented the capitulationist line of "everything through the united front, everything subordinate to the united front" in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region.

During the War of Liberation, he continued to implement the capitulationist line proposed by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in Northeast China, opposing Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside and opposing Comrade Lin Biao's correct proposal to mobilize the masses and establish base areas.

This counter-revolutionary revisionist has also spread many statements in international activities that obscure class contradictions, cancel class struggle, beautify the bourgeoisie, and beautify modern revisionism. He has praised the traitor Tito and Khrushchev, praised certain countries' reactionary bourgeoisie, and engaged in many capitulationist activities.

It has now been revealed that this counter-revolutionary revisionist had already surrendered and betrayed his comrades in prison before the Anti-Japanese War. This traitor later colluded with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, protecting and promoting a group of traitors, placing them in important leadership positions in the Party, government, and military. During this Cultural Revolution, the young Red Guards have exposed this big traitor clique within our Party, which is a great merit.

The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Beijing Municipal Committee, wearing the label of Communist Party members and cloaked in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are actually loyal running dogs of the bourgeoisie and imperialism. They adhere to the bourgeois ideological system and capitalist social system, opposing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the socialist social system. They are a group of counter-revolutionaries who oppose the Party and the people. Their struggle with us is a life-and-death struggle.

This gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists is extremely afraid of and hates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They have repeatedly used two-faced tactics to resist Chairman Mao's instructions, engaging in a series of underground activities and stubbornly opposing and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. It was during their engagement in these counter-revolutionary conspiracies that their hands were caught. The proletarian revolutionary ranks in the capital, responding to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, with the momentum of a landslide and the force of thunder, smashed the "San Jia Village" den in one fell swoop, directly attacking the old Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist lair, and defeated them thoroughly. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Beijing University, timely deciding to reorganize the old Beijing Municipal Committee and establish a new one, which was warmly supported by the people of the entire city and the entire country, greatly promoting the then-emerging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

However, the main responsible person of the reorganized new Beijing Municipal Committee did not implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao but implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. In June and July 1966, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing was directly controlled by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, turning Beijing into a base for implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. They stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, protecting the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Municipal Committee, shielding the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and directing the spearhead of the struggle against the proletarian revolutionary ranks. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party personally commanded the suppression of revolutionary ranks in many units, implementing white terror, and labeling a large number of revolutionary ranks as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists." They pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing to the brink of failure and allowed the bourgeois reactionary line to spread throughout the country.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao returned to Beijing, saving the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee formulated the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, declaring the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line and reigniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When new things like the Red Guards and the "big linking up" just emerged from the horizon, Chairman Mao gave them resolute support. The Red Guards in the capital played a role in fanning the flames and igniting the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line nationwide. In Beijing, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao received over ten million Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, giving great encouragement and strength to the proletarian revolutionary ranks. The proletarian revolutionary ranks in the capital, adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line, carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to make revolution, smashed the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, and repelled their repeated counterattacks. After a very sharp, complex, and tortuous struggle, they achieved one victory after another.

The proletarian revolutionary ranks in Shanghai launched the "January Revolution" storm. The proletarian revolutionary ranks in the capital responded to Chairman Mao's call, launching a struggle from below to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. After a relatively long period of preparation, brewing, and consultation, they respectively held the Red Guards Representative Conference of the capital's colleges and universities, the Revolutionary Workers' Representative Conference, the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference, and the Red Guards Representative Conference of middle schools. On the basis of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks, they established the temporary power organ of Beijing—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee according to Chairman Mao's directive of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades and fellow revolutionaries: As we celebrate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the international communist movement. After the proletariat seizes national power, the resistance of the bourgeoisie will inevitably increase tenfold, dreaming of restoring their paradise. For a considerable period, their political energy is still great, especially in the ideological and cultural fronts, they still occupy a considerable advantage. Therefore, whether the proletariat can maintain and consolidate its power, prevent capitalist restoration, and carry the socialist revolution to the end, this is an extremely important new task facing the proletariat. This problem has not been solved or has not been solved by all the predecessors of Marxism-Leninism. Through "peaceful evolution," capitalism has been restored in Yugoslavia, and in the Soviet Union and other countries as well. Since 1949, when our country established the dictatorship of the proletariat, Chairman Mao has led us in a series of major struggles against the bourgeoisie in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts. For example, in 1954, the struggle against the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, who had infiltrated the Party; in 1959, the struggle against the right-opportunist anti-Party clique; in the change of ownership, there were struggles of public-private joint operations, agricultural cooperativization, and people's commune-ization; the anti-rightist struggle on the political and ideological fronts; and the criticism of the reactionary thoughts of Hu Shi, Hu Feng, and Yang Xianjiang on the ideological and cultural fronts, etc. These are all struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie led by Chairman Mao, all struggles between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great decisive battle, a total attack on the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies. Mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to make a revolution, from below to above, to sweep away the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, government, and military, and to clean them up. Only our great leader Chairman Mao, such a great Marxist-Leninist, with extremely outstanding Marxist-Leninist wisdom, extremely rich experience in struggle, and extremely great courage, can initiate such a massive and earth-shaking mass movement. The struggle for power is the inevitable result of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. Only by overthrowing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, seizing their power, removing their positions, and putting the power in the hands of the resolute proletarian revolutionary ranks, can we carry the socialist revolution to the end, uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure that our country will never change color. Such a great democratic movement under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the struggle from below to seize power from the capitalist-roaders within the Party is necessary not only now but also in the future. This is Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism, as important and great as Marx's establishment of scientific socialism and Lenin's establishment of the theory of the proletariat seizing power in one country.

Now, the proletarian revolutionary ranks throughout the country are launching a new high tide of a mass movement to thoroughly criticize the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. This is a great decisive battle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the head of revisionism in our country. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in some regions and departments are the backbone forces for them to implement the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Thoroughly criticizing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the most important battle task at present. We must firmly grasp this major direction, fully mobilize the masses, launch a mass movement, and conduct a comprehensive criticism from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly settle accounts with and purge their revisionist poison in all fields.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the backer of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. We must, with the criticism of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party as the center, overthrow, smash, and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and seize back all the positions they have usurped. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, bravely join the battle, and thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." We must, in this great revolutionary mass criticism movement, further expand and consolidate the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks. All proletarian revolutionary ranks should, under the common goal of criticizing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, fight shoulder to shoulder and raise the level of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." While transforming the objective world, the proletarian revolutionary ranks must constantly transform their subjective world. We should, in this revolutionary mass criticism movement, fight while rectifying the style, break down the "self," establish the "public," overcome non-proletarian thoughts such as individualism, cliquism, sectarianism, liberalism, anarchism, and individualism, and strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. There are different opinions among revolutionary mass organizations, which should be solved by the method of open rectification, mainly through self-criticism. We should not fight "internal wars" because of different opinions, disrupt the major direction of the struggle, and even be taken advantage of by the enemy to sabotage our great unity and solidarity. We will not allow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to use rectification to attack the proletarian revolutionary ranks and struggle against the proletarian revolutionary ranks. Nor will we allow conservatives to use the pretext of great unity to weaken the proletarian revolutionary ranks, suppress the proletarian revolutionary ranks, and even annex the proletarian revolutionary ranks. Chairman Mao teaches us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If the proletariat cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot be finally liberated. We must unite with the majority of cadres and masses. For the masses who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary ranks should not discriminate against them or exclude them. In the struggle to criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party, we should patiently enlighten their class consciousness and enthusiastically help them correct their mistakes, uniting with them to make a revolution. Of course, for reactionary organizations like "Lian Dong," the proletarian revolutionary ranks cannot unite with them. For such organizations and their leaders, we must implement dictatorship, and for their ordinary members, we should split and dissolve them, treating them differently.

We must, in combination with this revolutionary mass criticism movement, further implement Chairman Mao's directive of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" must be based on the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks and must be gradually realized in the struggle of the revolutionary masses. Those cadres who are the objects of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can only be approved by the revolutionary masses and cannot self-appoint themselves. Every revolutionary cadre should actively participate in this mass criticism movement, actively criticize the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, thoroughly draw a clear line with them, seriously examine and correct their own mistakes, and accept the supervision and test of the revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionary ranks should focus on criticizing the part of the bourgeois reactionary line that "suppresses a large number and protects a few," support all cadres who want to make a revolution, and realize the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the struggle. Such a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can prevent bad elements from using the "three-in-one combination" to fish in troubled waters, counterattack, and implement capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. The majority of cadres in Beijing are good or relatively good. Many of them, such as Wu De and Liu Jianxun, have already stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary ranks. We believe that in the future struggle, they will be able to withstand the test, be tempered, and continue to make their due contributions to the revolution.

We must, through this revolutionary mass criticism movement, further mobilize the masses, better implement the directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and redouble our efforts to strive for the upper reaches, striving to complete and overfulfill the 1967 industrial and agricultural production plan.

We must, through this revolutionary mass criticism movement, further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought has developed in the struggle against various opportunist lines, especially the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. Fully utilizing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party as a negative example, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line from all aspects, can make us more deeply understand and master Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades and fellow revolutionaries: As we review the past and look to the future, we have an even deeper understanding that holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and completing all tasks. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat, and our spiritual atomic bomb. We proletarian revolutionary ranks have unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." We must plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every factory, commune, shop, school, institution, and street in the capital, and in every inch of the capital. We must build the capital Beijing, the people's capital, into a city that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the reddest and most revolutionary city.

Let us shout:

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上
    谢富治同志的讲话
    新华社二十日讯　谢富治同志在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上的讲话无产阶级革命派的同志们，战友们，红卫兵小
  将们：
    人们盼望已久的北京市革命委员会，现在宣告成立。
    北京市革命委员会的筹建工作，始终是在我们的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下进行的。在这全北京市人民欢欣鼓舞的时刻，让我们大家一起，衷心祝愿我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    今天，周恩来总理和中央文化革命小组的全体同志出席了我们的大会。让我们向他们表示热烈的欢迎！向他们致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    在北京市革命委员会筹建的过程中，人民解放军参加了革命的“三结合”，从各个方面给了我们有力的支援。让我们向他们致以革命的敬礼！我们要向人民解放军学习！
    上海、山西、贵州、黑龙江、山东等省、市的无产阶级革命派，最早实现了大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。他们是我们学习的榜样。今天，这些省、市的革命委员会的负责同志远道来参加我们的大会，支持我们。让我们向他们表示最热烈的欢迎和感谢！
    北京市革命委员会的成立，是首都的无产阶级革命派，是首都工、农、兵和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持无产阶级革命路线，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同资产阶级反动路线进行了长期的英勇斗争的结果。
    北京是我们的伟大领袖毛主席居住的地方，是无产阶级最高司令部的所在地。光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀着全世界，照耀着全中国，照耀着伟大祖国的首都。但是，被旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子长期盘踞下的旧北京市委，在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的庇护和支持下，一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，疯狂地反对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，恶毒地攻击、贬低伟大的毛泽东思想，反对活学活用毛主席著作。这个反革命修正主义集团，一贯反对毛主席的阶级斗争学说，鼓吹阶级调和，散布阶级斗争熄灭论，反对和破坏城乡社会主义教育运动，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保护资产阶级的利益。他们一贯反对突出无产阶级政治，在工业、农业、财贸、文教各个方面的工作中，推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞资本主义复辟。他们一贯反对以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级文化革命路线，利用他们所控制的各种宣传工具，大放修正主义的毒素，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。在京剧、舞剧、交响乐的革命中，他们百般刁难和攻击江青同志。尤其令人愤慨的是，他们一再抗拒毛主席关于批判吴晗的指示，长期按兵不动。姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》发表后，又不准北京的报纸转载，也不准发行单行本，还攻击上海的革命同志。他们一贯实行招降纳叛、结党营私的反革命修正主义的组织路线，安插亲信，重用坏人，包庇地、富、反、坏、右分子，打击无产阶级革命派。他们一贯对以毛主席为首的党中央实行封锁，把北京搞成一个“针插不进，水泼不进”的独立王国，妄图把北京变成他们实行反革命复辟的基地。这个反革命修正主义集团，是骑在北京广大人民群众头上的大恶霸，对党、对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    旧市委的反革命修正主义集团的头子，经常在干部中肉麻地吹嘘自己，为篡党、篡国制造舆论。事实上，旧北京市委的主要负责人，这个反革命修正主义分子，在历史上就是一个道道地地的投降主义者，是资产阶级在我们党内的代理人。
    抗日战争初期，这个反革命修正主义分子，在晋察冀边区执行的是王明的“一切通过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”的投降主义路线。
    解放战争期间，他在东北又变本加厉地继续执行王明路线，执行党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的投降主义路线。他反对毛主席的以农村包围城市的伟大战略思想，反对林彪同志放手发动群众，建立根据地的正确主张。
    这个反革命修正主义分子，在国际活动中，也背着中央散布了许多抹煞阶级矛盾，取消阶级斗争，美化资产阶级，美化现代修正主义的言论。他吹捧叛徒铁托和赫鲁晓夫，吹捧某些国家的资产阶级反动派，干了许多投降主义的勾当。
    现在查明，这个反革命修正主义分子，早在抗日战争前，就在狱中自首变节，出卖同志。这个叛徒，后来又同党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派相互勾结，包庇重用一批叛徒，把他们安插在党政军的重要领导岗位上。这次文化大革命中，红卫兵小将们挖出了我们党内的这个大叛徒集团，是一个丰功伟绩。
    旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，挂着共产党员的招牌，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣，实际上是资产阶级、帝国主义的忠实走狗。他们坚持资产阶级的思想体系和资本主义的社会制度，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和社会主义的社会制度。他们是一群反共反人民的反革命分子，他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争。
    这一伙反革命修正主义分子，对毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要命，恨得要死。他们一再玩弄两面派的手法，抗拒毛主席的指示，进行了一系列的地下活动，顽固地反对和破坏文化大革命。正是在他们进行这些反党阴谋活动的时候，他们的黑手被抓住了。首都的无产阶级革命派，响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，一举摧毁了“三家村”黑店，直捣旧市委反革命修正主义的老巢，把他们打得落花流水。毛主席和党中央批发了北京大学的全国第一张马克思列宁主义的大字报，及时作出改组北京旧市委、组织新市委的决定，得到全市人民和全国人民的热烈拥护，大大推动了当时刚刚兴起的无产阶级文化大革命。
    但是，改组后的北京新市委的主要负责人，没有执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，却执行了资产阶级反动路线。一九六六年六、七月间，北京市的无产阶级文化大革命，是在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派直接控制之下进行的，他们把北京变成了推行资产阶级反动路线的基地。他们站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，保护旧市委的反革命修正主义集团，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把斗争锋芒对准无产阶级革命派。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在许多单位亲自指挥，围剿革命派，镇压革命群众，实行白色恐怖，把大批革命群众打成“反革命”、“右派分子”。他们把北京的无产阶级文化大革命推到夭折的边缘，并且使资产阶级反动路线流毒全国。
    在这个关键的时刻，毛主席回到北京，挽救了无产阶级文化大革命。党的八届十一中全会制定了关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，重新点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。当红卫兵和大串连这类的新事物，刚刚从地平线上冒出来的时候，毛主席就给以坚决的支持。首都红卫兵对全国各地反对资产阶级反动路线的斗争，起了煽风点火的作用。在北京，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，接见了一千多万红卫兵和革命师生，给了无产阶级革命派以极大的鼓舞和力量。首都的无产阶级革命派，坚持无产阶级革命路线，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的精神，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，打退了它们一次又一次的反扑，斗争了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。经过十分尖锐、十分复杂和曲折的斗争，取得了一个接着一个的胜利。
    上海市的无产阶级革命派掀起了“一月革命”风暴。首都的无产阶级革命派响应毛主席的号召，自下而上地开展了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争。经过较长时间的准备和酝酿、协商，分别召开了首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会，革命职工代表会议，贫下中农代表会议和中等学校红卫兵代表大会，在无产阶级革命派大联合的基础上，按照毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，建立了北京市的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    同志们，战友们：在我们欢庆北京市革命委员会成立的时候，我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。无产阶级取得统治全国的政权以后，资产阶级的反抗必然要增强十倍，梦想恢复他们的天堂。在一个相当长的时间内，他们的政治能量还很大，特别是在思想、文化阵地上还占相当的优势。因此，无产阶级能否保持和巩固政权，防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底，这是无产阶级面临的极端重要的新课题。这个问题，所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者都没有来得及解决或者没有能够解决。通过“和平演变”，资本主义在南斯拉夫复辟了，在苏联和其它一些国家也复辟了。我国从一九四九年建立了无产阶级专政的政权以后，毛主席领导我们在政治、经济、思想、文化等各条战线上，同资产阶级进行了一系列重大的斗争。例如，一九五四年同混进党内的资产阶级代理人高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争，一九五九年同右倾机会主义反党集团的斗争；在改变所有制方面，有公私合营，农业合作化、人民公社化的斗争；政治思想战线上的反右派斗争；以及思想文化战线上对《武训传》、《红楼梦研究》的批判，对胡适、胡风的反动思想的批判，对杨献珍的“合二而一”的批判等等。这些，都是毛主席亲自领导的，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，都是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同以党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线的斗争。这次无产阶级文化大革命是一次大决战，是对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想的总攻击。发动亿万群众起来革命，从下而上地对混到党里、政府里和军队里的资产阶级代表人物，来一次大扫荡，大扫除。只有我们的伟大领袖毛主席这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，有极其卓越的马克思列宁主义的智慧，有极其丰富的斗争经验，有极其伟大的魄力，才能够发动这样规模巨大的，惊天动地的群众运动。夺权斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的必然结果。只有打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺他们的权，罢他们的官，把政权掌握在坚定的无产阶级革命派手中，才能把社会主义革命进行到底，挖掉修正主义的根子，防止资本主义复辟，保证我们的国家永不变色。这种在无产阶级专政条件下的大民主运动，和自下而上的向党内走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的斗争，就是保卫无产阶级已经取得的胜利果实，把无产阶级革命推向前进，不仅现在必需，以后也还会有。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的一个重大发展，同马克思建立科学的社会主义学说，列宁建立无产阶级在一个国家内夺取政权的学说同样重要，同样伟大。
    现在，全国的无产阶级革命派，正在掀起一个彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动的新高潮。这是无产阶级文化大革命中的一场大决战。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是我国修正主义的总头头。某些地区、某些部门的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则是他们推行反革命修正主义路线的基干力量。彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，这是当前最重要的战斗任务。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个大方向，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，从政治上、思想上、理论上进行全面的批判，彻底清算和肃清他们在各个领域内的修正主义流毒。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的后台。我们要以批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为中心，把旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，夺回被他们篡夺去的一切阵地。我们一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举革命的批判旗帜，勇敢地投入战斗，彻底打倒资产阶级反动路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”我们一定要在这场伟大的革命的群众性的批判运动中，进一步扩大和巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合。一切无产阶级革命派，都应该在批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，批判旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团这个共同目标下，并肩战斗，共同提高毛泽东思想水平。林彪同志指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”无产阶级革命派在改造客观世界的同时，也要不断改造自己的主观世界。我们应该在这场革命的群众性的批判运动中，边战斗，边整风，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，克服风头主义、山头主义、小团体主义、自由主义、无政府主义、个人主义等等非无产阶级思想，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。革命群众组织之间有不同的意见，应该用开门整风的办法，主要是进行自我批评来解决。不应该因为有不同意见而打“内战”，搅乱了斗争的大方向，甚至被敌人钻空子破坏我们的大联合，大团结。我们决不允许党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，借整风来攻击无产阶级革命派，斗争无产阶级革命派。也不允许保守派借口大联合，来削弱无产阶级革命派，压制无产阶级革命派，甚至吞并无产阶级革命派。毛主席教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。我们一定要团结干部和群众的大多数。对于受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，无产阶级革命派不应该歧视他们，排斥他们。要在批判党内走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，耐心地启发他们的阶级觉悟，热情地帮助他们改正错误，团结他们一道闹革命。当然，对于反动组织，如“联动”之类，无产阶级革命派不能同他们联合。对于这类组织和他们的头头，要实行专政，对他们的一般成员，则要分化瓦解、区别对待。
    我们要结合这场革命的群众性的批判运动，进一步贯彻执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针。革命的“三结合”，必须以无产阶级革命派的大联合为基础，必须在革命群众斗争中逐步实现。那一些干部是革命的“三结合”对象，只能由革命群众来批准，不能自封。每一个革命的干部，都应该积极投入这场群众性的批判运动，积极批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底揭发旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团，彻底同他们划清界线，认真检讨和改正自己的错误，接受革命群众的监督和考验。无产阶级革命派，要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，支持一切愿意革命的干部起来革命，在斗争中实现革命的“三结合”。这样的革命的“三结合”，就可以防止坏人借口“三结合”，浑水摸鱼，反攻倒算，实行资本主义反革命复辟。北京市的广大干部，大多数是好的和比较好的。他们中的许多人，如吴德、刘建勋等同志，已经开始站到无产阶级革命派的一边。我们相信，在今后的斗争中，他们将能经受考验，得到锻炼，继续为革命作出应有的贡献。
    我们要通过这场革命的群众性的批判运动，进一步发动群众，更好地贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成和超额完成一九六七年的工农业生产计划而奋斗。
    我们要通过这场革命的群众性的批判运动，更深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。毛泽东思想是在同各种机会主义路线，特别是同以党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争中发展起来的。充分利用党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作为反面教员，从各个方面彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，可以使我们更深刻地领会和掌握毛泽东思想。
    同志们，战友们：在我们回顾过去，展望未来的时候，我们更加深刻地体会到，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底和完成一切任务的根本保证。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器，是我们的精神原子弹。我们无产阶级革命派，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。我们一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”我们要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都的每一个工厂，每一个公社，每一个商店，每一个学校，每一个机关，每一条街道，插遍首都的每一寸土地。我们要把人民的首都北京，建设成永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的最红最红的革命城市。
    让我们高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
