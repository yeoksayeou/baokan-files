The revolutionary experience of the Red Flag District Weighing Apparatus Factory in Jinan after seizing power is: putting revolution first and never forgetting class struggle.

The broad revolutionary masses have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, quickly corrected the erroneous idea of focusing only on production and neglecting revolution, and engaged in a head-on struggle against class enemies, smashing the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration plots.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 16th—The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Weighing Apparatus Factory in the Red Flag District of Jinan, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, initially focused only on improving production and neglected revolution and class struggle. As a result, not only did production not improve, but the power they had seized was almost lost. The proletarian revolutionary masses learned from this lesson that no matter how complex things may be, revolution must always be given top priority, and production must be guided by revolution to achieve victory in both revolution and production.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the factory's proletarian revolutionary masses organized the "Red Guards," standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, exposing and criticizing the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and resolutely fighting against the bourgeois reactionary line. The "Red Guards" expanded their ranks through struggle, united the majority of workers, achieved great unity among the proletarian revolutionary masses, and seized all power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, establishing a revolutionary committee.

After seizing power, the entire factory presented a great situation. Some "conservative" organizations were overthrown, over 90% of the workers joined the "Red Guards," forming a united front; the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who had been exposed seemed to be quite "obedient." Under this situation, the "Red Guards" thought that the situation was stable and that everything was peaceful; however, production was chaotic, and the factory had not completed the state plan in the previous stage due to the sabotage by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. To solve the production problems, the revolutionary committee threw themselves into production, believing that their future task was to improve production.

However, "when the tree is still, the wind does not cease." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who had just been overthrown by the proletarian revolutionary masses were not willing to accept their defeat. After regaining their composure, they redoubled their efforts, fought desperately with tenfold energy and hatred. Initially, they wanted to see the revolutionary masses make a fool of themselves, thinking that the revolutionary masses could not handle production and would fail. When they saw that production was gradually back on track and their plots could not succeed, they came out directly. The one who previously seemed very "obedient" capitalist-roader within the Party now openly threatened the revolutionary masses, wanting to settle accounts with them. He also colluded with the core members of the original "conservative" organizations, compiled black materials against the revolutionary masses, and plotted to seize power back. They slandered the "Red Guards" as having "impure organization," having "ambitious people" and "political thieves"; they also used divisive, threatening, and bribery tactics to try to destroy the "Red Guards," seize back the leadership, and return to power, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the proletarian revolutionary masses.

This situation shocked the revolutionary masses. They immediately sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. Even after the country is pacified, they will still use various means to sabotage and disrupt. They will try every day and every moment to restore their power in China. This is inevitable and undoubted. We must not relax our vigilance." Chairman Mao's teachings enlightened the revolutionary masses. They realized that after seizing power, they had developed a sense of peaceful complacency, focusing only on improving production and neglecting vigilance against class enemies. Now that the enemy was counterattacking, this was a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. They must fight inch by inch, give a fierce blow to the enemy's counter-revolutionary restoration plots, and smash them thoroughly! The revolutionary masses armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and engaged in a head-on struggle against class enemies, exposing the plots of the capitalist-roaders, quickly repelling this capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide.

Chairman Mao said: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser. Our work will be better." This setback gave the factory's proletarian revolutionary masses a profound lesson, making them further understand the long-term, sharp, and complex nature of class struggle. They realized that after the proletarian revolutionary masses took power, they must follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, correctly implement Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and firmly put revolution first, guiding production with revolution, to achieve victory in both revolution and production.

Recently, the factory's proletarian revolutionary masses studied the article "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine and the article "Patriotism or Treachery?" by Comrade Peng Zhen. They further realized that after the victory of seizing power, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory were not willing to give up, attempting to restore power, because they had the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. Therefore, they must raise high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, closely linking the struggle-criticism-transformation within the factory with the criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, both overthrowing and exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory and the top capitalist-roader within the Party.

    济南红旗区衡器厂革命派夺权后的亲身体会是：
    把革命放在首位　时刻不忘阶级斗争
    广大革命派用毛泽东思想武装头脑，迅速纠正了只抓生产放松革命的错误思想，同阶级敌人展开针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了资本主义反革命复辟的阴谋诡计
    据新华社济南十六日电　济南市红旗区衡器厂的无产阶级革命派，在从本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺取了大权以后，一度只顾着把生产搞好，而放松了革命，放松了阶级斗争。结果不但生产没有搞上去，已经夺取的大权也险些失掉。无产阶级革命派从这一次教训中体会到：无论事情怎样千头万绪，都必须把革命放在首位，以革命统帅生产，才能取得革命、生产双胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，衡器厂的无产阶级革命派组织了“红卫队”，站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，揭发、批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，同资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。“红卫队”在斗争中壮大了自己的队伍，团结了大多数职工，实现了无产阶级革命派大联合，并且从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺得了本厂党、政、财、文一切大权，建立了临时革命委员会。
    全厂在夺权以后出现了一派大好形势。一些“保”字号的组织垮了台，全厂百分之九十以上的职工参加了“红卫队”，形成了大联合的局面；已被揪出的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派态度似乎也很“老实”。在这种形势下，“红卫队”便认为大局已定，天下太平了；而生产上却是千头万绪，全厂在前一阶段由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的破坏，生产没有如期完成国家计划。为了解决生产上的问题，临时革命委员会一头扎进生产里，他们认为今后的任务就是如何把生产搞好。
    但是，“树欲静而风不止”，刚刚被无产阶级革命派夺了权的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并不甘心于自己的失败，在惊魂稍定之后，又以十倍的努力、疯狂的热情、百倍增长的仇恨来拚命挣扎。开始，他们想看革命派的笑话，认为革命派搞不好生产，会在生产上栽筋斗。当他们看到生产逐步引上正轨，他们的阴谋无法得逞时，便直接跳了出来。那个原先看来态度很“老实”的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，这时候公开威胁革命派，要同革命派算帐。他还伙同原“保”字号组织的骨干分子开会，整理革命派的黑材料，密谋策划反夺权。他们污蔑“红卫队”“组织不纯”，有什么“野心家”和“政治扒手”；还用分化瓦解、威胁利诱等卑劣手段，妄图把“红卫队”搞垮，夺回领导权，重新上台，对无产阶级革命派实行反革命的资产阶级专政。
    这个情况，使革命派猛吃一惊。他们立即向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”毛主席的教导使革命派心明眼亮了。他们认识到，自从夺权以后，自己产生了和平麻痹思想，一心只想把生产搞好，放松了对阶级敌人的警惕。现在敌人反扑上来了，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗，必须“寸土必争”，对敌人的反革命复辟阴谋，给予迎头痛击，彻底粉碎，坚决打垮！革命派用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，同阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，揭露了走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计，很快地打退了这股资本主义反革命复辟的逆流。
    毛主席说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”这次反复，使这个厂的无产阶级革命派受到了一次极为深刻的教育，使他们进一步懂得了阶级斗争的长期性、尖锐性、复杂性。他们认识到，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，必须沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，正确贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针，坚决把革命放在首位，用革命统帅生产，才能使革命、生产获得双胜利。
    最近，这个厂的无产阶级革命派学习了《红旗》杂志评论员的文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和戚本禹同志的文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》，他们进一步认识到，在夺权胜利以后，厂里的一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派所以贼心不死，妄图复辟，就是因为有党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在支持他们，作他们的总后台。因此，必须高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，把厂里的斗批改与批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派紧密地结合起来，既要批倒、批臭自己厂里的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，又要批倒批臭党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
