Such a Bonus System

In Soviet enterprises, the practice is purely and simply one of "money talks." The bonus system is regarded as a panacea for stimulating production "enthusiasm." In many enterprises, a frenzy of chasing after bonuses has developed. Below are just a few ordinary examples revealed in Soviet newspapers.

"Turning Flies into Elephants"

In February of this year, a Soviet worker wrote to a newspaper to expose the fraudulent practices in his factory to obtain bonuses. The letter said:

	We produce woolen fabrics in our factory. My job is to collect wet goods from the dyeing section and achieve a certain shrinkage rate. Sometimes we dry without shrinkage. Often, we stretch the fabric as much as possible, turning flies into elephants. In this way, we produce "advanced" products. For example, a piece of wet fabric that is 40 meters long before drying becomes 42 to 43 meters after stretching and drying. We use this method to deceive ourselves, our mothers, sisters, brothers, and comrades.

	A worker's daughter bought some of our factory's wool fabric to make a dress. The dress looked very nice. But as soon as it rained, it was ruined. She hung the dress to dry at home, and it could no longer be worn. I also know of two people whose clothes were ruined after the first wash. Last year, there was a month when the workers did not stretch the fabric to the required length, and our deputy foreman was punished for this, losing his bonus. If a worker tells the workshop director about his mistake, he will find fault with you and find an excuse to punish you. Those who turn a blind eye to all this and say yes to everything are respected, and even bonuses can be given to them!

The Seventeenth Bonus

"Why did the walls of Building No. 80 collapse? Please state the cost of rework and the culprit!"

	This question did not embarrass the director of the Fourth Construction and Installation Trust, Yakirevich. Some say he even hoped to get a bonus for the high quality of Building No. 80!

	Yakirevich's trust fails to complete the state plan every month, and the quality of the work is poor. However, he received bonuses seventeen times last year!

	Anything can be used to get a bonus. Even uncompleted plans and fabricated "rationalization suggestions" are rewarded. For example, on the construction site of the Knitting Combine, Yakirevich replaced stones with sand and received 200 rubles. If he now uses stones to replace sand, it is easy to see that the bonus is guaranteed.

	There are countless examples of bonuses being awarded without cause. The leaders of the Fifth Construction and Installation Trust, Belov and Golishteyn, received "advance" bonuses every month from May last year, each time 125 rubles.

	In the Kursk Industrial Construction Company, the pursuit of bonuses reached an absurd level. When a certain technological line was put into production, to cheat and get bonuses, the actual working time was falsely reported. The department head and chief accountant illegally obtained 220 rubles, and some staff members received two bonuses. To prevent the truth from being revealed, even those who did not work during the construction period were given bonuses.

Where Did the Workers' Bonuses Go?

	In many enterprises that have switched to the new economic "system," there is money in the bonus fund, but it is not given to the workers. A glass factory, for example, in the first quarter of last year, the bonuses for engineering and technical personnel and staff amounted to 98.7% of their wages, and those given to management personnel even amounted to 147.2% of their wages, but no funds were allocated for rewarding the workers...

### 如此奖金制度

    如此奖金制度
    在苏联的企业里，实行的是地地道道的卢布挂帅，奖金制度被奉为刺激生产“积极性”的法宝。在很多企业里形成了拚命“追逐奖金的狂热”。下面仅仅是苏联报刊上透露的几个普普通通的事例。
    “把苍蝇变成大象”
    今年二月，一个苏联工人给报纸写信，揭发他所在的工厂如何弄虚作假、骗取奖金的行为。信中写道：
    我们工厂生产毛织品。我的工作是：从染色的地方收到湿货，做出一定的缩水率。有时不缩水就烘。常常是拚命把料子拉长，把苍蝇变成大象。这样我们就生产了先进（！）产品。譬如，一块湿货，在干燥之前长四十米，经过拉幅干燥之后，就变成四十二至四十三米了。我们就用这种办法，欺骗自己，欺骗母亲、姊妹兄弟和同志。
    一个工人的女儿买来我们厂出的毛料做成连衣裙。衣服做得很漂亮。但是一下雨就完了。她回家把衣服晾干，就再也不能穿了。我还知道有两个人，他们的衣服也是在第一次洗过之后就再不能穿了。
    去年有一个月，工人没有把布匹拉长到应有的米数，我们的副工长为此受了罚，剥夺了他的奖金。如果有工人向车间主任说出他的错误，他就会找你的碴，找借口来惩罚你。谁对这一切视而不见，唯唯称是，谁就受尊敬，甚至可以发给他奖金！
              （据《共青团真理报》）
    第十七次奖金
    “第八十号楼房的墙壁为什么倒塌了。请说出返工的费用和肇事人！”
    这个质问并没有使第四建筑安装管理局主任雅基列维奇受窘。有人说，他还指望靠第八十号楼房的高质量得奖哩！
    雅基列维奇领导的管理局月月完不成国家计划，工程质量也不好，但是去年他却得了十七次奖金！
    什么事情都可以捞奖金。连没有完成的计划、虚报的“合理化建议”都发奖金。比方说，在建筑针织联合企业的工地上，雅基列维奇把石子换成沙子，就让他得了二百卢布。要是现在他再用石子来代替沙子呢？可想而知，奖金是又可以拿定的。
    无缘无故发奖的事情，到处都有。第五建筑安装管理局领导人贝洛夫和戈利施捷因，从去年五月起一连几个月拿到了
  “预支”奖金，每月都是一百二十五卢布。
    库尔斯克工业建设公司中，追逐奖金达到了最荒诞的程度。某一工艺作业线投入生产的时候，为了骗取奖金，虚报了实作时间，部主任和总会计师非法获得了二百二十卢布，有些工作人员获得了两次奖金。为了不使人泄漏内幕，连在动工时间内根本没有参加工作的人也发了奖金。
                    （据《真理报》）
    工人的奖金哪里去了？
    在许多改行经济“新体制”的企业里，奖励基金里钱是有的，但是却不拿出来奖励工人。有个玻璃厂，去年第一季度工程技术人员和职员的奖金占他们的工资的百分之九十八点七，发给管理工作人员的，甚至占他们工资的百分之一百四十七点二，但是没有规定拨出奖励工人的基金……
        （据《劳动报》）
