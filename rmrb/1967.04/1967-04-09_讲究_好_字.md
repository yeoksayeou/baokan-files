We must do everything well, both quickly and thoroughly. Tasks that should be completed today should not be delayed until tomorrow; we must also ensure that our work is of high quality.

In the current spring farming season, everyone is enthusiastic and works hard, but often neglects the "good" character. I have experienced this myself. When participating in cotton seed selection, I noticed that my progress lagged behind others, so I didn't care about the details and just quickly dumped the seeds into the basket, not bothering to pick out the small and shrunken ones. Someone suggested I be more careful, but I felt uncomfortable hearing that. It was only after studying Chairman Mao's works that I realized my sloppy attitude towards work was irresponsible to the revolution. The cotton seeds I selected did not meet the standards, which would affect the growth of the seedlings and the harvest, harming the revolutionary cause. After understanding this, I spent more than half a day re-selecting the seeds I had already put in the basket. Looking back, if I had paid attention to quality and worked harder, I could have achieved both speed and quality, catching up with others. However, because I was careless, I had to redo the work, not only failing to speed up but actually slowing down. This was a good lesson for me in understanding the importance of paying attention to the "good" character.

Chairman Mao teaches us to be extremely responsible in our work, and this includes paying attention to the "good" character. If we all pay attention to the "good" character and insist on high standards and quality, then the victories we achieve will be solid and reliable.

    讲究“好”字
    民兵副排长　申必英
    我们不论干什么事情，既要快，应该今天完成的任务决不拖到明天去干；又要好，扎扎实实地干，坚持高质量。
    在当前春耕生产中，大家干劲很足，干起来很猛，但往往容易忽视“好”字。我就有过这种现象。我参加选棉种，看到进度掉在别人后面，就不管三七二十一，小的瘪的没有拣净，就哗啦一下倒进箩里。有人要我拣得认真点，我听了很不舒服。学习了毛主席著作，才觉得对工作这样马马虎虎，是对革命不负责任的表现。我拣的棉种不符合要求，苗就出不好，收成就要受到影响，这对革命事业不利。我想通了这个道理，又花了半天多时间，把倒进箩里的棉种重新拣了一下。现在想想，当时如果我重视质量，加劲拣，还是可以好中求快，赶上其他同志的，可是由于我拣得毛毛糙糙，造成返工，不但没有快得起来，反而慢下来了。这对于我认识讲究“好”字的意义，也是一个极好的教训。
    毛主席教导我们对工作要极端的负责任，这个极端里面就包括讲究“好”字的意思。我们大家都能讲究“好”字，坚持高标准，高质量，那么，我们所得到的一切胜利，就是实实在在的，过得硬的。
