Title: Unmasking the "Old Revolutionary"

The article "Patriotism or Treachery?" published in the *Red Flag* magazine has powerfully exposed the true face of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, revealed the Chinese Khrushchev, and dug out the mastermind behind revisionism. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is the red signal for launching a general offensive against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. This article is excellent, and I support it a thousand times, ten thousand times!

What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks for what class. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party has for many years worn the disguise of a "revolutionary of the proletariat," preaching capitalism, loving capitalism, and dreaming of capitalism. He openly defies the revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao, fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought. He claims that the treacherous film *The Last Emperor* is patriotic, praises poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers, and openly resists the criticism of this big poisonous weed, allowing it to spread its venom throughout the country. He makes black reports everywhere, extolling capitalism, advocating that exploitation is not a crime and rebellion is unjust, attempting to replace the socialist system with the capitalist system. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: The founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, marked the basic conclusion of the stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of the socialist revolution. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, however, sings the opposite tune, vigorously advocating the "consolidation of the new democratic order." This person, who hangs the sign of a Communist Party member and calls himself an "old revolutionary," is the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. What does he long for? What order does he hope for? It is capitalism.

What is particularly infuriating is that he blatantly claims that the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it, and that the more capitalists exploit, the more glorious it is. This is utterly absurd!

We working people have suffered greatly under the old society and understand even more the happiness of the new society. Under the exploitation and oppression of landlords and capitalists, how many working people were homeless and destitute; under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the working people rose up to overthrow the three big mountains and only then had the happiness of today. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, however, wants to send us back into the clutches of the exploiters. He vigorously advocates protecting the rich peasant economy, promotes the "four freedoms," and advocates the "three autonomies and one contract," with the sole purpose of restoring capitalism and making the working masses suffer again. Let me tell you, this is a pipe dream and will never happen!

This number one capitalist-roader in the Party never forgets to restore capitalism day and night. He actively promotes *Self-Cultivation* to corrupt people's minds, create public opinion, and attempts to make people detach from the fiery class struggle, lock themselves in a small room to engage in idealism, cultivate individualism, and make the proletariat disarm themselves ideologically, laying the ideological foundation for the bourgeoisie to restore power. His intentions are truly malicious!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened our eyes and heightened our political sense. We must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, uproot and eradicate the big poisonous weed of *Self-Cultivation*, criticize it thoroughly and expose its poison, and completely eliminate its harmful influence.

    揭开“老革命”的画皮
    济南部队学习毛主席著作积极分子  孙乐义
    《红旗》杂志发表的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文，最有力地揭开了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫，挖出了修正主义的总后台。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的红色信号。这篇文章好得很，我一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，多少年来披着“无产阶级革命家”的外衣，讲的是资本主义，爱的是资本主义，做梦想的也是资本主义。他明目张胆地对抗我们伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想。他把卖国主义的影片《清宫秘史》，说成是爱国主义的，把毒草吹捧成香花，他公然抗拒对这株大毒草的批判，使之流毒全国。他到处作黑报告，竭力颂扬资本主义，鼓吹剥削无罪，造反无理的谬论，企图让资本主义制度来代替社会主义制度。我们伟大领袖毛主席说：一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国的成立，标志了新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命阶段的开始。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却大唱反调，极力宣扬要“巩固新民主主义秩序”。这个挂着共产党员招牌的以“老革命”自居的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，他所向往的是什么？他所希望的是什么秩序？就是资本主义。
    特别令人气愤的是，他公然胡说什么劳动人民不是反对剥削而是欢迎剥削，胡说什么资本家剥削越多越光荣。这真是岂有此理！
    我们劳动人民饱尝了旧社会的痛苦，也更懂得新社会的幸福。在地主、资本家的剥削压榨下，有多少劳动人民流离失所，家破人亡；在我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，劳动人民起来推翻了三座大山，才有了幸福的今天。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却想把我们重新送进剥削者的魔掌。他极力主张保护富农经济，提倡“四大自由”，鼓吹“三自一包”，目的只有一个，就是让资本主义复辟，让劳苦群众再受二茬罪。告诉你！这是白日作梦，绝对办不到！
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，日夜不忘复辟资本主义。他积极抛出《修养》来腐蚀人心，制造舆论，企图让人脱离火热的阶级斗争，关在小屋里搞唯心主义，养个人主义，使无产阶级解除思想武装，为资产阶级复辟打好思想基础，用心可谓毒矣！
    无产阶级文化大革命擦亮了我们的眼睛，提高了我们的政治嗅觉。我们一定要紧握毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，把《修养》这株大毒草铲光锄净，批透批臭，彻底扫清它的流毒。
