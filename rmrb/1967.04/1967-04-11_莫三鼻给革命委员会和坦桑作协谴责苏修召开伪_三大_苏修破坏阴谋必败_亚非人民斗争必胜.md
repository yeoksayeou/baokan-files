The Mozambique Revolutionary Committee and the Tanzanian Writers' Union have condemned the Soviet revisionists for illegally convening a fake "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" in Beirut. They expressed their support for the genuine Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing this year.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on April 9, Lusaka: The National Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, Marciano Chichoco, recently issued a statement condemning the Soviet modern revisionists for their divisive activities in Beirut. He expressed support for the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement declared: "Under the leadership of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, Mozambican writers resolutely condemn the divisive activities of Soviet modern revisionists, who are trying to sabotage the Asian and African movements and the Third Congress to be held in Beijing. We are convinced that the conspiracies of the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys will fail. We know that all progressive Asian and African writers' organizations will attend the Third Congress to be held in Beijing."

The statement said: "The Mozambique Revolutionary Committee fully supports the statement issued by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers condemning the fake 'Congress' held in Beirut."

The statement emphasized: "We are convinced that the struggles of the Asian and African peoples will surely achieve victory."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian Writers' Union Chairman Yehya Muhammad Hassanini issued a statement on April 4 saying: "We resolutely condemn the splitters, especially the Soviet modern revisionists, who are trying to sabotage our movement and the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing this year."

The statement pointed out: "However, due to the increasing vigilance of the Asian and African peoples and writers, their shameful plots will fail. They can only further expose themselves."

The statement said, the Tanzanian Writers' Union "refuses to recognize the fake 'Third Congress' convened by the Soviet revisionists in Beirut."

The statement reaffirmed: "The Tanzanian Writers' Union only recognizes the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers with its headquarters in Colombo and its executive secretariat in Beijing."
