	Uproot the Poisonous Weed "Self-Cultivation" Completely

	Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, Wei Fengying

	The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party is China's Khrushchev. He is even more cunning and vicious than Khrushchev! For many years, he has stood on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, fiercely opposing our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

	In 1939, in his essay "Oppose Surrenderist Activities," Chairman Mao pointed out: "The first and foremost problem facing the Chinese nation in the face of Japanese invaders has always been whether to fight or not to fight. ... 'To fight is to survive, not to fight is to perish'—this is the conclusion of all patriotic parties and all patriotic comrades." Chairman Mao also pointed out in his essay "The Current Situation and the Party's Tasks" on October 10 of the same year: "The leading organs of our Party at all levels and all comrades should heighten their vigilance against the current situation, and use all their strength to consolidate our Party ideologically, politically, and organizationally, to consolidate the army and the government led by our Party, ..." At this crucial moment that decides the life and death of the Chinese nation, our great leader Chairman Mao led the people of the entire nation to resolutely fight to the end. However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party threw out his carefully crafted "Self-Cultivation" poisonous weed at this time, detached from the reality of class struggle, detached from the reality of fighting the Japanese invaders, and talked nonsense about "self-cultivation," attempting to undermine our firm will to defeat Japanese imperialism spiritually, actually fanning the flames of Japanese imperialist aggression, and adapting to the needs of imperialism and the domestic surrenderists. How vile his intentions are!

	In 1962, our country was in a temporary period of economic difficulties. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries at home and abroad colluded to stage an anti-China farce. The Kuomintang bandits, at the instigation of American imperialism, madly clamored for a "counterattack on the mainland," and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took the opportunity to stir. In this situation where class struggle was extremely sharp and complex, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party repackaged and disguised his poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" and threw it out again, attempting to "shackle" the hands and feet of revolutionary comrades, making the broad Party members, League members, and revolutionary masses stay indoors and read "Self-Cultivation," not talking about politics, not talking about class struggle, not talking about the issue of power, making us disarm politically and ideologically in the face of the fierce attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies. How vile his intentions are!

	Mao Zedong Thought is the magic mirror that exposes all ghosts and monsters. The death knell of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party has sounded. The poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" must be thoroughly criticized. What does it cultivate? What does it nourish? It revolves around the "I" and the "self" everywhere, and speaks for the landlords and the bourgeoisie everywhere. I was born into a poor family, and the old society that eats people forced me to pick up coal, dig wild vegetables, and beg for food, suffering endless humiliation and pain. Our great Chairman Mao saved me from the sea of suffering. I will never forget the bitterness of the old society, and I cherish even more the sweetness of the new socialist era. However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, fiercely opposes Mao Zedong Thought, propagates the philosophy of "man-eat-man," and propagates the extremely reactionary "theory" of "exploitation is justified," attempting to restore capitalism and attempting to make the exploiting class ride on our heads again. This is truly a pipe dream!

	The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party is a true Khrushchev sleeping by our side. We must, with the fearless spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow and expose the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party and his entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and thoroughly eliminate their poisonous influence!

    坚决把《修养》这棵大毒草连根拔掉
    学习毛主席著作积极分子　尉凤英
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是中国的赫鲁晓夫。他比赫鲁晓夫更阴险、更毒辣！他多年来，一直站在资产阶级反动立场上，疯狂地反对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。
    毛主席在一九三九年写的《反对投降活动》一文中指出：“中华民族在日本侵略者面前，历来存在的劈头第一个大问题，就是战不战的问题。……‘战则存，不战则亡’——这是一切爱国党派和一切爱国同胞的结论”。毛主席又在同年十月十日写的《目前形势和党的任务》一文中指出：“我党各级领导机关和全体同志，应该提高对当前时局的警觉性，用全力从思想上、政治上、组织上巩固我们的党，巩固党所领导的军队和政权，……”在这决定中华民族生死存亡的关键时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导全国人民坚决抗战到底。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却在这时把他精心炮制的《修养》这棵大毒草抛了出来，脱离阶级斗争现实，脱离抗击日寇的现实，空谈什么“修养”，妄图在精神上瓦解我们打败日本帝国主义的坚强斗志，实际上助长了日本帝国主义的侵略气焰，适应了帝国主义和国内投降派的需要，用心何其毒也！
    一九六二年，我国处在暂时经济困难时期，帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外一切反动派勾结在一起，导演了一场反华丑剧。蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义的唆使下，疯狂叫嚣“反攻大陆”，地、富、反、坏、右分子乘机蠢蠢欲动。就在阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂的情况下，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派又把大毒草《修养》重新粉饰、乔装打扮一番，抛了出来，妄图“禁锢”广大革命同志的手足，使广大党团员、革命群众脱离阶级斗争，坐在屋子里死读《修养》，不谈政治，不谈阶级斗争，不谈政权问题，使我们在国内外阶级敌人疯狂进攻面前解除政治、思想上的武装，又何其毒也！
    毛泽东思想是识破一切牛鬼蛇神的照妖镜。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟敲响了。《修养》这棵大毒草必须彻底进行批判。它修的是什么？养的是什么？它处处围绕着“我”字和“私”字打转转，处处替地主、资产阶级说话。我出身在贫苦的家庭，吃人的旧社会逼得我捡煤核，挖野菜，讨饭过活，受尽了欺凌和痛苦。伟大的毛主席把我从苦海中拯救出来。我永远不会忘记旧社会的苦，更珍惜今天社会主义新时代的甜。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却披着马克思列宁主义外衣，大反毛泽东思想，宣扬人吃人的处世哲学，宣扬“剥削有理”的反动透顶的“理论”，妄图复辟资本主义，妄图使剥削阶级重新骑在我们头上，这真是白日做梦！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是地地道道的睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。我们一定以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他的一整套反革命修正主义谬论批倒斗臭，彻底肃清其流毒！
