Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam's Quang Tri and Thua Thien Fight for Three Months, Annihilate Over 10,000 Enemy Troops

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, April 16th, our correspondent reports: In the spring of 1967, the liberation armed forces fighting in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region of South Vietnam, after more than three months of heroic struggle, have achieved a great situation and obtained brilliant results, annihilating more than 10,000 U.S. and puppet troops. The victory on the Quang Tri-Thua Thien battlefield is another heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season offensive" plan.

The provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien are located south of the 17th parallel, the temporary military demarcation line in Vietnam, and are one of the main battlefields for the U.S. and puppet forces' second "dry season counteroffensive." As soon as the dry season began, the enemy dispatched an additional division of troops and replaced puppet troops with U.S. troops in combat, attempting to reverse the initiative on the battlefield. However, under the heavy blows of the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien, the enemy's scheme has not succeeded in the slightest. The spring of 1967, with its more than three months, is a period during which the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien have moved from victory to greater victory. In January and February, the people of the two provinces had already caused the enemy to lose more than 3,000 troops. In March, the liberation armed forces continued to advance, displaying a spirit of fearlessness in sacrifice, fearlessness in fatigue, and bravery in battle. They fought more than 440 battles, establishing even more brilliant achievements and annihilating more than 7,700 enemy troops. This number is almost equivalent to the total number of enemy troops annihilated by the people of this region in June, July, and August of last year. At the beginning of April, the liberation armed forces, in the battles to attack the La Vang, Chi Ha outposts, and the city of Quang Tri, achieved even more abundant results, annihilating 1,600 enemy troops in one battle.

The brilliant victories achieved by the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien over the past three months mark the rapid growth and development of the people's armed forces on this battlefield. The more troops the enemy has deployed here, the more they have been annihilated. It was like this when they used puppet troops, and it is still like this now that they are using U.S. troops. Throughout the dry season, the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien have firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield, and the enemy has still not been able to escape the humiliating situation of being passively beaten. More than ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that the class instincts of the enemy always lead them to overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the revolutionary forces. The stupid U.S. aggressors and their lackeys have once again fallen into the same trap here, completely misjudging the situation.

The enemy's strategic ambition in Quang Tri and Thua Thien is to block the 17th parallel temporary military demarcation line with heavy troops and realize their dream of annihilating the main forces of the liberation armed forces in this area. To this end, since the end of last year, the U.S. and puppet forces have dispatched large numbers of troops along the 9th National Highway and between the 1st National Highway from Quang Tri to Hue, launching multiple large-scale "sweeps." The U.S. aggressors have also deployed several regiments of U.S. troops to replace puppet troops in the main defense of the 9th National Highway and have established many outposts in the northern region of Quang Tri Province and many artillery positions south of the Ben Hai River near the military demarcation line. The situation on the battlefield over the past three months shows that the enemy's strategic intentions have completely failed. The "sweeps" they have launched are either empty-handed because they cannot find the liberation armed forces or end in failure with heavy casualties. The enemy's 9th National Highway defense line has become a graveyard for U.S. aggressors. The liberation armed forces move freely and frequently attack the enemy on this important strategic highway that runs through the northern part of Quang Tri Province. At the same time, many important military outposts of the enemy north of Quang Tri City, including artillery and long-range artillery bases such as the Yu Temple, Kun Tian artillery base, 182, 137, 241 highland artillery positions, and the Da Gen airport in the northwest of Xiang Hua, are also repeatedly subjected to heavy artillery shelling and attacks by the liberation armed forces. Among them, the Yu Temple U.S. artillery base in Yu Ling County has been repeatedly subjected to devastating attacks. With the continuous attacks on the enemy outposts in Yu Ling, Gan Lu, Dong He, and Xiang Hua, the important northern stronghold of the U.S. and puppet forces—the provincial capital of Quang Tri—is increasingly exposed to the liberation armed forces. On the morning of April 6, the liberation armed forces, with lightning speed, rushed into Quang Tri City, directly attacking the enemy's lair, and once controlled the city for four hours, causing great shock to the U.S. and puppet forces. Thus, on the Quang Tri-Thua Thien battlefield, the enemy cannot advance or defend, and a large number of troops are tightly tied down on this land of only 9,500 square kilometers, unable to move.

The brilliant achievements of the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien over the past three months and the victory of the people of the Yongling area in the north in shelling the Yu Temple U.S. base are a stern warning to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. No matter how much military pressure the U.S. and puppet forces will exert on this battlefield, no matter how crazily they escalate the war, what awaits them will be an even more disgraceful failure than this spring.

    粉碎美帝以重兵封锁十七度线的罪恶阴谋
    南越广治承天军民奋战三个月歼敌一万多
    据新华社河内十六日电　本社记者报道：一九六七年春季，战斗在越南南方广治—承天地区的解放武装力量，经过三个多月的英勇奋战，打出了一派大好形势，取得歼灭美伪军一万数千名的辉煌战果。广治—承天战场上的胜利，是对美国侵略者第二个“旱季战略反攻”计划的又一当头棒喝。
    广治、承天两省，位于越南临时军事分界线十七度线的南侧，是美伪集团发动第二次“旱季反攻”的主要战场之一。旱季刚开始，敌人就向这里增派了一个师的兵力，并用美军取代伪军作战，妄图扭转战场上的主动权。但是，在广治—承天军民的沉重打击下，敌人的阴谋丝毫未能得逞。一九六七年春季的三个多月，是广治—承天军民从胜利走向更大胜利的三个多月。在一、二月份里，两省军民就使敌人丧失了三千多的兵力。三月份，解放武装力量继续乘胜前进，发扬不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，勇敢战斗的精神，连续作战四百四十多次，建立了更加辉煌的战功，歼灭敌人七千七百多名。这个数字，几乎相当于去年六、七、八三个月这个地区军民歼敌的总数。四月初，解放武装力量在攻打拉汪、慈下据点和广治市的战斗中，更赢得一仗歼敌一千六百名的丰硕战果。
    广治—承天军民三个多月来取得的光辉胜利，标志着在这个战场上的人民武装力量获得了迅速的成长和发展。敌人在这里投入的兵力越多，被消灭的也就越多。过去用伪军打是这样，现在用美军打还是这样。在整个旱季，广治—承天军民一直牢牢地掌握着战场上的主动权，敌人依旧未能摆脱被动挨打的狼狈窘境。十几年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席就曾经指出，敌人的阶级本能引导他们总是高估自己的力量，低估革命势力的力量。愚蠢的美国侵略者及其走狗，在这里又一次重蹈覆辙，他们完全错误地估计了形势。
    敌人在广治—承天的战略野心，是企图以重兵封锁十七度临时军事分界线，并实现其围歼这一带的解放武装力量主力的梦想。为此，从去年年底以来，美伪集团抽调大批兵力，沿第九号公路和在第一号公路广治市到顺化市之间地区，发动多次大规模“扫荡”。美国侵略者还以数旅的美军，投入第九号公路取代伪军担负主要防务，并在广治省北部地区增设许多据点，在军事分界线边海河以南布置许多大炮阵地。三个多月战场形势表明，敌人的这种战略意图是完全破产了。他们勉强发动的一些“扫荡”，不是因为找不到解放武装力量而扑了空，就是以损兵折将而宣告失败。敌人的第九号公路防线，成了埋葬美国侵略者的坟场。解放武装力量在这条横贯广治省北部的重要战略公路线上，活动自如，频繁袭击敌人。与此同时，敌人在广治市以北的许多重要军事据点，包括重炮和远程炮兵基地，诸如育庙、昆天的炮兵基地、一八二、一三七、二四一等高地的炮兵阵地以及香化西北的达根机场等，也不断遭到解放武装力量的猛烈炮轰和袭击。其中犹灵县的育庙美军炮兵基地，曾多次遭到毁灭性的打击。随着犹灵、甘露、东河、香化等地敌军据点的连续遭到打击，美伪集团在北部的重镇——广治省省会广治市，越来越暴露在解放武装力量面前。四月六日清晨，解放武装力量以迅雷不及掩耳之势，突入广治市内，直捣敌人的巢穴，并曾一度控制该市达四小时之久，使美伪集团感到莫大震惊。这样，在广治—承天战场上，敌人进不能攻，退不能守，大量的兵力，被紧紧地牵制在这块面积不过九千五百平方公里的土地上，不能动弹。
    广治—承天军民三个多月赫赫的战果和北方永灵地区军民炮轰育庙美军基地的胜利，便是对美国侵略者及其走狗的严厉警告。不管美伪集团还会向这个战场施加多大的军事压力，不管他们疯狂地把战争“升级”到什么程度，等待着他们的，将是比今年春季更加可耻的失败。
