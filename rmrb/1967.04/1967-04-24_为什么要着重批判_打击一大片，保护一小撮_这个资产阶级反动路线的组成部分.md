In the current mass criticism of the party's top handful of capitalists-roaders in power, it is a crucial task to focus on criticizing their bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres. This task must not be taken lightly.

The handful of big and small capitalists-roaders in power within the party, on the one hand, label revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and on the other hand, "strike a large area" among the cadres. All this is for the purpose of "protecting a few." If we only criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in dealing with the masses and neglect to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in dealing with cadres, we will not be able to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. We will not be able to truly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "uniting with the majority and striking at a few" in the matter of cadres. This will greatly hinder the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, hinder the revolution's "three-in-one combination," hinder the struggle for power, hinder the "grasp revolution, promote production," and thus will not be able to finally overthrow the party's top handful of capitalists-roaders. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will not be able to be carried through to the end.

To make a revolution, one must rely on the broad masses. However, as Chairman Mao has said: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a powerful leading core to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be able to last long nor be able to move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." Experience has shown that the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries cannot be victorious without the participation of revolutionary cadres who are politically more mature and have rich experience in struggle. Experience has also shown that in the struggle to expose and criticize a handful of revisionists and the top capitalist-roader in the party behind them, the broad revolutionary cadres are an indispensable important force. It must also be seen that without thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres, one cannot have a clear understanding of the situation of the cadres and know what to struggle against, what to criticize, and what to reform. Thoroughly criticizing this bourgeois reactionary line is an important link in closely combining the struggle to criticize the party's top handful of capitalists-roaders with the struggle-criticism-reform in one's own unit.

Therefore, the cadre issue is a major and key issue in the current struggle. The criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres is absolutely not a matter of "shifting the target," but hitting the target; this criticism is absolutely not "unrelated" to the struggle to criticize the top capitalist-roader in the party, but is closely related.

The handful of capitalists-roaders in power within the party always take the revolutionary slogans put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, distort them, confuse right and wrong, and mix black and white to bite back at the revolutionaries. Now, isn't there someone taking the opportunity of our party's proposal to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in the matter of cadres to shout about how "the revolutionaries rose to power by 'doubting everything' and 'overthrowing everything'"? Isn't there someone saying, "We carried out the reactionary line of suppressing the masses, and you carried out the reactionary line of striking at the cadres; we protected a few, and you struck a large area, so we are all the same"? These fallacies must be refuted!

To treat cadres indiscriminately, to generally exclude and overthrow them, is the advocacy of those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line. They have always done it this way. The top capitalist-roader in the party is the main target of our criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line in the matter of cadres.

The broad proletarian revolutionaries have an infinite love for the party and Chairman Mao and a deep hatred for the handful of capitalists-roaders in power within the party. They have always been fiercely "striking at a few" and have never "protected a few." In the fierce and surging mass movement, there may sometimes be some excessive actions and mistakes of one kind or another, but this is fundamentally different in nature from the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area to protect a few." The label of the bourgeois reactionary line absolutely cannot be put on the proletarian revolutionaries. The proletarian revolutionaries' criticism of this reactionary line is entirely justified!

The party's top handful of capitalists-roaders, in order to carry out the reactionary policy of "striking a large area and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres, in addition to personally "squatting" and directly commanding, also use the broad masses' hatred for a handful of revisionists to put forward many ultra-leftist but rightist slogans, vigorously spreading the anarchist trend of "generally doubting and generally overthrowing" among the masses, using the masses to expand the scope of strikes. This is their main means and also a more sinister means of "striking a large area and protecting a few." This anarchist trend often also reflects within the revolutionary ranks, hindering some people from bravely criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in the matter of cadres. The proletarian revolutionaries must face up to this fact, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the anarchist trend. Those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line regard the cadre ranks as "all black" and "completely rotten." We absolutely cannot allow this extremely wrong concept to continue to exist within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries. We need to be realistic and class-conscious, not "leftist" but rightist.

The publication of the two important articles "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line in the Matter of Cadres Must Be Criticized" and "'Striking a Large Area and Protecting a Few' Is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. This shows the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, a few people, influenced by the anarchist trend, do not make any class analysis, do not distinguish between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, but generally divide "the masses" and "those in power," believing that "whatever those in power support, one must oppose," and "cadres coming out is the restoration of capitalism." Therefore, they do not actively criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few." This is extremely wrong. The proletarian revolutionaries must firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the matter of cadres and must stand up straight to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in the matter of cadres. Only by liberating the "large area" in the struggle can the "few" be thoroughly isolated and overthrown. Only in this way can the "few" be finally smashed in their attempt to stage a comeback and restore capitalism.

Thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in the matter of cadres cannot be limited to words but must be implemented in action. The proletarian revolutionaries must be models in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

The process of implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy is a sharp and complex class struggle. First of all, one must be good at correctly identifying cadres. Chairman Mao teaches us: "One must not only look at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance but must look at the cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." The proletarian revolutionaries must firmly grasp the weapon of class analysis and examine and identify cadres in the great storms of the struggle between the two lines. It is not enough to rely on a few people to quietly sort out materials. We should advocate the methods of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions, mobilize the masses to fully understand and discuss the entire work and history of the cadres, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and draw correct conclusions. For cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented. As long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, they should be allowed to correct their mistakes and be encouraged to make amends.

It must be recognized that the broad revolutionary cadres, in their struggle against the handful of capitalists-roaders in power within the party, have the same goal as the revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionaries should "observe and help" the cadres who are willing to make a revolution, with deep class feelings and wholehearted enthusiasm, actively and patiently support them to catch up with the situation, encourage them to come out and "show themselves," and encourage them to go among the masses and be tested in the struggle. Through struggle, gradually achieve the unity of more than ninety-five percent of the cadres, and concentrate forces to strike at a handful of revisionists.

Revolutionary cadres should go among the masses, throw themselves into the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution, build new achievements, and establish new merits to truly win the trust of the masses. They must not passively wait, detach themselves from the struggle, and follow the teachings of the book *Cultivation* to "reflect in seclusion," fantasizing that one day someone will suddenly "liberate" them and form a "three-in-one combination" with them. Truly revolutionary cadres should not fear the attacks of the handful of capitalists-roaders in power within the party and various conservative forces, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, and stand on the side of the revolutionary youngsters. This requires arduous ideological struggle and a revolution that touches the soul. All revolutionary cadres must pass this fundamental test of stance.

The true proletarian revolutionaries dare to venture, dare to act, dare to make a revolution, and dare to rebel. They not only dare to "strike at a few" but also dare to "liberate a large area" and unite with the majority. Now, in many places, the proletarian revolutionaries, in order to firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the matter of cadres and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, have launched enthusiastic learning and discussion and are actively implementing it in action. The task is heavy, and time is pressing. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary ranks and broad revolutionary cadres, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres by the party's top handful of capitalists-roaders, unite with the broad masses and broad cadres, form a mighty revolutionary army, and advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

### 为什么要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分

    为什么要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分
    在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开的群众性的大批判中，着重批判他们在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，是一项十分重要的战斗任务，切切不可等闲视之。
    党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派，一方面把革命群众打成“反革命”，另一方面对干部“打击一大片”，这都是为了“保护一小撮”。如果我们只是批判了在对待群众问题上的资产阶级反动路线，而忽视了批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，那就不可能真正把资产阶级反动路线批深批透，就不可能真正贯彻对干部“团结大多数，打击一小撮”这条毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就会极大地妨碍无产阶级革命派的大联合，妨碍革命的“三结合”，妨碍夺权斗争的胜利，妨碍“抓革命，促生产”，也就不可能最终打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，无产阶级文化大革命就不可能进行到底。
    干革命，必须依靠广大群众。但是，正如毛主席所说：“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”经验证明，无产阶级革命派夺权斗争要想取得胜利，要建立革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”临时权力机构，非有在政治上比较成熟、有丰富斗争经验的革命领导干部参加不可。经验还证明，在揭露和批判一小撮修正主义分子以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，广大革命干部是一支不可缺少的重要力量。还要看到，不彻底批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，就不可能做到对干部状况心中有数，就不知道斗什么、批什么、改什么。彻底批判这条资产阶级反动路线，正是把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来的一个重要环节。
    因此，干部问题是当前斗争中的一个重大问题，关键问题。对干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这条资产阶级反动路线的批判，绝不是什么“转移目标”，而是正中目标；这个批判同批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，绝不是什么“毫不相干”，而是关系大得很。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，总是把毛主席和党中央提出的革命口号接过去，加以歪曲，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，反咬革命派。现在，不是又有人趁我们党提出批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的机会，大嚷什么“革命派是靠‘怀疑一切’、‘打倒一切’起家”的吗？不是又有人在胡说什么“我们执行了压制群众的反动路线，你们执行了打击干部的反动路线；我们保护了一小撮，你们打击了一大片，大家彼此彼此”吗？对于这些谬论，必须痛加驳斥！
    对干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥，一概打倒，这是提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人的主张，他们从来就是这样干的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是我们批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的主要锋芒所向。
    广大无产阶级革命派，他们对党和毛主席无限热爱，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派强烈憎恨。他们从来就是狠狠地“打击一小撮”，从来就不会“保护一小撮”。在猛打猛冲的群众运动中，有时会出现某些过火的行动，犯这样或那样的错误，但是，这和“打击一大片”以便“保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，在性质上是根本不同的。资产阶级反动路线的帽子，绝对扣不到无产阶级革命派头上。无产阶级革命派对这条反动路线的批判，就是理直气壮！
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了推行对干部“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，除了亲自“蹲点”、直接指挥之外，还利用广大群众对一小撮修正主义分子的憎恨，提出许多形“左”实右的口号，极力在群众中散布“一概怀疑、一概打倒”的无政府主义思潮，假手于群众，来扩大打击面。这是他们“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的主要手段，也是更加阴险的手段。这种无政府主义思潮，往往也反映到革命队伍内部来，妨碍一些人勇敢地批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。无产阶级革命派必须正视这个事实，努力活学活用毛主席著作，牢牢掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，彻底肃清无政府主义思潮的影响。提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人把干部队伍看成是“一片黑”、“烂光了”，我们绝不能让这种极端错误的概念在无产阶级革命派队伍内部继续存在。我们要的是实事求是和阶级分析，而不是宁“左”勿右。
    《红旗》杂志第五期《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》这两篇重要文章的发表，受到了广大革命群众和革命干部的热烈拥护。这正说明毛主席的无产阶级革命路线具有无比强大的威力。然而，有少数人，却受了无政府主义思潮的影响，不作任何阶级分析，不区别两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线，而笼统地区分什么“群众”和“当权派”，认为“凡是当权派拥护的自己就要反对”，“干部起来了就是资本主义复辟”，因而，就不去积极批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，这是极端错误的。无产阶级革命派，必须坚决捍卫毛主席在干部问题上的无产阶级革命路线，必须挺起腰杆来批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。只有在斗争中把“一大片”真正解放出来，才能把“一小撮”彻底孤立，彻底打倒。也只有这样，才能最终粉碎那“一小撮”搞反攻倒算，复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，不能只停留在口头上，而且要落实到行动中。无产阶级革命派要做贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的模范。
    贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的过程，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。首先，要善于正确地识别干部。毛主席教导我们：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”无产阶级革命派必须牢牢掌握阶级分析的武器，在两条路线斗争的大风大浪里来考察和识别干部。只靠少数人冷冷清清地整理材料是不行的。我们应当提倡大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，放手发动群众，对干部的全部工作和全部历史进行充分的了解和讨论，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，作出正确的结论。对犯错误的干部，要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。
    必须认识到，广大的革命干部在与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，和革命群众的目标是一致的。无产阶级革命派对愿意起来革命的干部应当“一看二帮”，怀着深厚的阶级感情，满腔热情地帮助他们跟上形势，积极耐心地支持他们出来“亮相”，鼓励他们到群众中去，在斗争中经受考验。通过斗争，逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，集中力量打击一小撮修正主义分子。
    革命干部应该到群众中去，投身到革命的大批判、大斗争的洪流中，建新功，立新劳，真正取得群众的信任。绝不能消极等待，脱离斗争，按照《修养》那本书的说教，去“闭门思过”，幻想那一天会有人突然把自己“解放”出来，同自己搞“三结合”。真正要革命的干部，应该不怕党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和各种保守势力的打击，坚定地站到无产阶级革命派一边来，站到革命小将一边来。这需要艰苦的思想斗争，需要触及灵魂的革命。一切革命干部，都必须经受住这个根本立场的考验。
    真正的无产阶级革命派，敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反，不仅敢于“打击一小撮”，而且敢于“解放一大片”，团结大多数。现在，许多地方的无产阶级革命派，为了在干部问题上坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，已经展开了热烈的学习和讨论，并且积极落实到行动中来。任务重大，时间紧迫。无产阶级革命派的战士们，广大革命干部们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，团结广大群众，团结广大干部，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
