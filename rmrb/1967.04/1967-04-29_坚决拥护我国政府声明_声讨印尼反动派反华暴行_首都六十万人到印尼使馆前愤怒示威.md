Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the capital poured towards the Indonesian Embassy today, angrily denouncing the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities. The demonstrators unanimously expressed their resolute support for the solemn statement issued by our government on April 26 and their resolute support for the just struggle of Indonesian compatriots against the brutal persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries. From April 24 to today, over 600,000 revolutionary masses in the capital have taken part in demonstrations and parades in front of the Indonesian Embassy.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and cadres from the capital, enraged by the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government, have been pouring towards the Indonesian Embassy with portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, holding copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," and carrying banners and placards. They shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Down with Soviet revisionism," "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries," and "Resolutely support the Indonesian compatriots' struggle against persecution." They submitted a large number of protest letters to the Indonesian Embassy, strongly condemning the new fascist atrocities of the Suharto-Nasution reactionary clique against China and Chinese. The revolutionary masses angrily pointed out that the Suharto-Nasution reactionary clique had slaughtered tens of thousands of excellent sons and daughters of the Indonesian people and repeatedly carried out brutal persecution and bloody massacres against the broad masses of Chinese compatriots. Now, they have launched a new wave of frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese movements. They pointed out that all the evil deeds of the Indonesian reactionaries would be thoroughly settled by the progressive people of the world and the revolutionary people of Indonesia, and they would end up "beginning with the intention to harm others and ending with harming themselves."

Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, who had worked at the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and had fought bravely against the Indonesian reactionaries to defend the dignity of our great motherland, participated in the demonstration. He strongly protested against the series of anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities committed by the Indonesian reactionaries. He said that all anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people elements would not have a good end, and this is an iron law that does not change with people's will. The heinous crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries against the Chinese and Indonesian people will definitely be punished by history.

Batches of overseas Chinese and Red Guards from the capital came to the Indonesian Embassy to express their strongest protest against the Indonesian reactionaries. They pointed out that the era when the Chinese people could be bullied is gone forever. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and the Indonesian reactionaries must clearly remember this. They expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of Indonesian compatriots against persecution and pointed out that as long as the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries against the compatriots does not stop, the resistance of the Indonesian compatriots will not stop. The people of the motherland will definitely support the just struggle of the Indonesian compatriots against persecution to the end. They also expressed their determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to build the socialist motherland more solidly and strongly, and to let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the land of the motherland, which will be the greatest support for the patriotic compatriots in Indonesia.

Some Indonesian students in China also came to the Indonesian Embassy to hold protests and demonstrations over the past few days. They strongly protested against the Suharto-Nasution reactionary regime's mass slaughter of the Indonesian people and Chinese compatriots, creating a white terror of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-China. They pointed out that this was completely barbaric fascist atrocity. They said that now, the workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth students in Indonesia have risen up and are gradually arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, waging increasingly fierce struggles. Their actions are completely just. They dare to win and will ultimately achieve victory!

    坚决拥护我国政府声明　声讨印尼反动派反华暴行
    首都六十万人到印尼使馆前愤怒示威
    新华社二十八日讯　首都成千上万的革命群众今天川流不息地涌向印尼驻华大使馆，愤怒声讨印尼反动派疯狂反华、排华的暴行。示威的群众一致表示最坚决拥护我国政府四月二十六日的严正声明，最坚决支持印尼华侨反对印尼反动派残酷迫害的正义斗争。从二十四日到今天，前往印尼驻华大使馆举行示威游行的首都革命群众已达六十多万人。
    被印尼反动政府法西斯暴行激怒了的首都革命工人、农民、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，这几天高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手持鲜红的《毛主席语录》，举着标语和漫画牌，不断涌向印尼驻华大使馆门前。他们高呼“打倒美帝”“打倒苏修”“打倒印尼反动派”“坚决支持印尼爱国华侨反迫害斗争”的口号，向印尼驻华大使馆递交了大批抗议信，强烈谴责苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动当局反华排华的法西斯新暴行。革命群众愤怒指出，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动当局在印尼屠杀了几十万印尼人民的优秀儿女，一次又一次地对广大华侨进行残酷的迫害和血腥屠杀，现在又进一步掀起了疯狂的反华排华浪潮。他们指出，印尼反动派所干的这一切罪恶勾当，必将受到世界进步人民和印尼革命人民的彻底清算，他们必将“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终”。
    曾经在我国驻印尼大使馆工作、为了维护伟大祖国的尊严向印尼反动派进行过英勇不屈斗争的赵小寿同志参加了示威游行，他对印尼反动派一系列的反华排华暴行提出最最强烈的抗议。他说，所有反华、反共、反人民的家伙都不会有好下场，这是铁一般的规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的。印尼反动派对中国人民和印尼人民所犯下的滔天罪行，一定要遭到历史的惩罚。
    首都归侨和红卫兵小将们一批批来到印尼大使馆门前，向印尼反动派表示最强烈的抗议。他们指出，中国人民任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的，印尼反动派必须清楚地记住这一点。他们表示最坚决支持印尼华侨反迫害的正义斗争，并且指出，印尼反动派对华侨的迫害一天不停止，印尼华侨的反抗也必将一天不停止。祖国人民对印尼华侨反迫害的正义斗争，一定支持到底。他们还表示一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义祖国建设得更巩固、更强大，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在祖国的土地上永远高高飘扬，这将是对印尼爱国侨胞的最大支持。
    首都的无产阶级革命派工人，今天有的凌晨刚下夜班就参加了游行，他们在抗议信中正告印尼反动当局：谁胆敢与中国人民为敌，就绝不会有好下场。首都汽车公司、北京广播器材厂、北京无线电仪器厂等工厂的无产阶级革命派工人纷纷表示，全世界人民必将进一步团结起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造美帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造印尼反动派和一切反动派的反。无产阶级革命派坚信印尼新的革命高潮必将到来，印尼人民终将冲垮帝国主义及其走狗在印尼的反动统治。
    一些印尼在华留学生，这几天也来到印尼大使馆门前举行抗议示威。他们最强烈地抗议苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政权大肆屠杀印尼人民、印尼华侨，制造了反共、反人民和反华排华的白色恐怖。他们指出，这完全是野蛮的法西斯暴行。他们说，现在，印尼工人、农民和革命的青年学生已经起来了，他们正在逐步用毛泽东思想武装起来，开展愈来愈猛烈的斗争。他们的行动是完全正义的。他们敢于胜利，也必将最终取得胜利！
