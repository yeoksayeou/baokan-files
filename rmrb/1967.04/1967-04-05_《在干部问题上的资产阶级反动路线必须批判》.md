Those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, on the one hand, incited the masses to struggle against cadres, and on the other hand, incited cadres to suppress the masses, attempting to achieve a double victory by striking both the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres. They aimed to prevent cadres from coming forward to make revolution, and to create serious antagonism between cadres and the masses. Therefore, in the process of implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadres issue.

    提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人，一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面挑动干部整群众，企图一箭双鵰，既整了革命群众，又整了革命干部。他们企图使干部不能站出来革命，使干部和群众的关系严重对立。因此，在实现革命的“三结合”的过程中，必须彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。
