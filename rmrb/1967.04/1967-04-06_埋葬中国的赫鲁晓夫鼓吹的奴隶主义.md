In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, countless revolutionary pioneers, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, shouted the slogan "Rebellion is justified" and launched fierce attacks on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At this critical moment, the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, China's Khrushchev, spread the poisonous weed of "slavery ideology" to oppose Chairman Mao's great call.

Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao has always opposed slavery ideology. As early as 1930, Chairman Mao taught us: "Regarding the directives of higher-level leading organs, if we do not discuss and examine them based on actual conditions but blindly execute them, this formalistic attitude based solely on the 'higher-level' concept is very wrong." In 1942, during the Rectification Movement, Chairman Mao again taught us: "For anything, we should sniff it with our noses to discern its good or bad, and then decide whether to welcome it or resist it. Communists must ask why for everything, think it over carefully in their minds, see if it conforms to reality, see if it is reasonable, and absolutely not follow blindly, absolutely not advocate slavery ideology." Recently, Chairman Mao also taught us: "Harmful revolutionary leadership should not be accepted unconditionally but should be resolutely resisted." In the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's profound teachings have nurtured batch after batch of revolutionary pioneers, becoming an indestructible spiritual pillar for them to withstand one storm after another and achieve one victory after another. Today, Chairman Mao's teachings provide us with powerful weapons to fight against slavery ideology.

Slavery ideology is a product of the exploitative system. For thousands of years, the exploiting classes have always portrayed themselves as natural "masters" and vilified revolutionary rebels as traitors. The philosophy of "slavery ideology" is a reactionary philosophy that suppresses revolution and corrupts revolutionary will, produced to meet the needs of the exploiting classes.

The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, China's Khrushchev, is the biggest peddler of this reactionary philosophy. Through the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" and a series of actions, he has fully and continuously brought slavery ideology into the Party, corrupting the fighting spirit of Communist Party members year after year, destroying the Party's revolutionary principles, poisoning the Party's body, creating public opinion and conditions for his plot to usurp the Party and the state, and committing unforgivable crimes.

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly bury the reactionary slavery ideology championed by China's Khrushchev, smash his plot to usurp the Party and the state, and resolutely pull him down and make him step aside!

Refuting the Reactionary Fallacy of "Absolute Organizational Obedience"

Chairman Mao teaches us that a political party is a "tool of class struggle." "To make a revolution, we must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party built on the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." We have the Communist Party today precisely to achieve the political goal of the proletariat to overthrow capitalism and build socialism and communism. Any political party is merely an organizational form to realize the political demands of a certain class. Therefore, the organizational line of the Party should serve the political line and should become a guarantee or tool for implementing and realizing the Party's political line.

However, the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road blatantly and arrogantly opposes Chairman Mao's principles of party building, vigorously advocating that organizational principles are above everything else, that political lines should follow organizational lines, and promoting unconditional and blind absolute obedience in organization.

He shouts: "We advocate absolute organizational obedience."

He also criticizes a certain view: "I can obey superiors and the majority, but superiors and the majority must be correct in principle and politics. If they are wrong in politics, I will not obey. This is to make the correctness of the majority, or superiors, or the Central Committee a condition for obedience. This condition is wrong."

The set of fallacies advocated by China's Khrushchev is pure reactionary nonsense. As early as over forty years ago, Lenin pointed out sharply: "Without the political leadership of the party being correct, its strategy and tactics being correct, 'the discipline of the revolutionary party, the discipline which enables the vanguard of the oppressed class to achieve victory over the oppressors and to remodel the whole of society,' cannot be built up." However, China's Khrushchev advocates "absolute obedience" regardless of whether it is correct or not in politics, essentially demanding that people blindly and faithfully execute his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, serving his plot to usurp the Party and the state and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration.

He also deceives people with ulterior motives, saying that he advocates "obedience regardless of right or wrong" to "maintain the unity of the Party." However, as Lenin pointed out: "Unity, this is a great cause and a great slogan! But what the workers' cause needs is the unity of Marxists, not the unity of Marxists with opponents and distorters of Marxism." When talking about purifying our Party's ranks, Chairman Mao teaches us: "To rectify the organization, we must first rectify our thinking and carry out a struggle between the proletarian and non-proletarian ideologies." Therefore, the unity of the Party we should maintain is first and foremost the unity based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the unity based on actively carrying out ideological struggle and fighting against all actions and words that go against Mao Zedong Thought. The history of our Party and the history of the international communist movement prove: Those who have always split the Party and caused its division are various opportunists and revisionists who oppose and distort Marxism. Therefore, his attempt to pin the crime of "destroying the unity of the Party" on the revolutionary faction that does not follow his baton is doomed to fail.

For a long time, this number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has spared no effort in promoting the so-called "absolute organizational obedience" slavery ideology, causing tremendous losses to the Party and the revolutionary cause. The most prominent example is that on the eve of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he regarded himself as the embodiment of the Party organization, ordering others to surrender and betray the Communist Party, join the Kuomintang. Some traitors followed his orders, abandoned revolutionary political principles, publicly issued "anti-communist statements," swore to "firmly oppose communism," and were regarded by him as "correct" in "organizational principles," receiving his strong promotion and usurping many leading positions in the Party. However, those steadfast comrades, unshakable in politics, refused to surrender and betray, and were instead persecuted and attacked in various ways because they did not "absolutely obey" his black directives! How perverted is this! How absurd is this reactionary logic! The "absolute organizational obedience" slavery ideology he advocates is precisely serving his reactionary class capitulationism.

This China's Khrushchev, using the counter-revolutionary slavery ideology of "absolute organizational obedience," actively promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, opposes Chairman Mao's correct line, and commits heinous crimes of betraying the revolution. His crimes must be thoroughly settled!

Do Not Allow Slavery Ideology to Masquerade as the Party's Democratic Centralism

This number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, in order to peddle his slavery ideology, tramples on the principles of democratic centralism, passing off his "slavery ideology" as our Party's democratic centralism.

Democratic centralism is the basic organizational principle of our Party. This democratic centralism is democracy based on centralism, and centralism based on democracy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In organization, we must practice democratic life under centralized guidance." The first item on the line is "the leading organs of the Party must have a correct guiding line." Lenin also said well: "People who have no common party spirit cannot work together just on the basis of the mechanical principle of the minority submitting to the majority." These all stipulate that democratic centralism requires a correct guiding ideology and guiding line as a prerequisite and condition. Undoubtedly, this correct guiding ideology is the great Mao Zedong Thought, and this correct guiding line is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

However, this number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, departing from the correct guiding ideology, says that "obedience to the organization, obedience to the majority, obedience to superiors is absolute and unconditional." In "Self-Cultivation," he emphasizes with great seriousness: "As long as it is the majority, or the superiors or the Central Committee have passed and decided, one must obey, even if it is wrong, one must obey, especially at this time, one must especially observe discipline, obey the majority, obey superiors or the Central Committee, regardless of whether the majority and superiors or the Central Committee are right or wrong." He even says: "When the truth is on the side of the minority, and the majority advocates something that is not the truth," "the minority still has to obey the majority" and so on.

Obedience! Absolute obedience! Unconditional obedience! The correct minority must obey the incorrect majority, the correct subordinates must obey the incorrect superiors, the correct individual must absolutely obey the incorrect organization. One cannot ask half a question, otherwise it is "destroying the Party's democratic centralism," it is "destroying the Party's discipline." What kind of "Party discipline" is this! This is completely the counter-revolutionary discipline that the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road puts on the heads of revolutionary masses to maintain his reactionary rule. Everyone knows that the Communist Party has true and false, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism; discipline also has different class content, proletarian discipline and bourgeois discipline, revolutionary discipline and counter-revolutionary discipline. For proletarian revolutionary fighters, we strictly observe the revolutionary discipline of the Chinese Communist Party armed with Mao Zedong Thought; we unconditionally accept the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao at the helm. We should resolutely resist all incorrect leadership that goes against Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; we should thoroughly smash the bourgeois discipline; we should resolutely oppose slavery ideology.

China's Khrushchev advocates unconditional obedience to the majority, with another sinister purpose, which is to cooperate with Khrushchev's revisionism in attacking our Party, attempting to force our Party to submit to the will of the Soviet revisionists, follow Khrushchev's baton, and surrender to revisionism. However, our great leader Chairman Mao, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism revolution, resolutely defeated the plot of Khrushchev's revisionism and the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. The "Seven Criticisms of the Open Letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU" clearly pointed out: "On fundamental issues of Marxism-Leninism, who is right and who is wrong is not something that can be judged based on the majority or minority in any situation." This thoroughly refutes the attempt by the Soviet revisionists to impose the so-called "resistance to the will of the majority" and "destruction of international discipline" on our Party, and also smashes the evil intentions of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

We must thoroughly expose China's Khrushchev's slavery ideology that masquerades as the Party's democratic centralism. His "democratic centralism" denies the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, removing the soul of the revolution; under the name of democratic centralism, it practices slavery ideology, hanging the head of democratic centralism and selling the meat of slavery ideology. Let us use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose his attempt to use slavery ideology to masquerade as the Party's democratic centralism in broad daylight.

Overthrow the Reactionary Instrument Theory

China's Khrushchev also uses more cunning disguises to peddle slavery ideology, turning the "voluntary spirit of Communist Party members" into being the "tame tool" of the Party. He says: "Is it to be a tame tool or a mischievous tool? Is it to be an easily controllable tool or a difficult-to-control tool? Of course, it must be a tame tool, an easily controllable tool." His slavery ideology is, in politics, revisionism that does not advocate revolutionary principles, in organization, absolute commandism, and in dealing with Party members and the masses, headless instrumentalism! This is a thoroughly anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary fallacy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All words and deeds of Communists must take as their highest standard whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by the broadest masses of the people." Chairman Mao's teaching is the only correct voluntary spirit for every Communist Party member.

Chairman Mao calls on us to "put down our burdens and start our machines"; to raise revolutionary consciousness and avoid falling into blindness. Chairman Mao has made the following exposition on this revolutionary consciousness: "To give full play to initiative, it must be specifically reflected in the creative ability, sense of responsibility, lively work, daring to and good at raising questions, expressing opinions, criticizing shortcomings, and the supervisory role of the leading organs and leading cadres towards the leading organs and leading cadres from the standpoint of love." In the minds of the advocates of slavery ideology, Communist Party members should not have revolutionary pioneering spirit, and every Party member should become "like a very sophisticated tool," becoming a pile of thoughtless machines.

This instrumental theory of slavery ideology is actually a policy of dumbing down the people. According to this theory, the Party does not need to arm Party members with Mao Zedong Thought, does not need to give the Party's policies to the broad masses of Party members, does not need to conduct political and ideological education for Party members, does not need to raise the revolutionary consciousness of Party members, but only needs to conduct training in the organizational method of "absolute obedience." These advocates of slavery ideology are thorough historical idealists, regarding themselves as Zhuge Liang who can turn the world upside down, regarding the masses as slaves to be manipulated, and strangling the revolutionary spirit of the working people in this reactionary policy of dumbing down the people. This is a thorough fascist theory!

More importantly, China's Khrushchev deliberately avoids a very important principle here, that is, being the "tame tool" of which Party? Is it the Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought or the revisionist Party? Is it the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at the helm or the bourgeois headquarters with this number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road at the helm? He once advocated: "Even if the majority or superiors or the Central Committee are truly wrong, you should still obey and first execute the wrong ones." According to his logic, that is, in any situation, one should be his "tame tool," and let him "use it very conveniently and skillfully." This set of instrumental theory of slavery ideology is completely for him to prepare public opinion and organization for the restoration of capitalism.

The Counter-Revolutionary Essence of Slavery Ideology

Stripping off all the disguises of China's Khrushchev's advocacy of slavery ideology, we can see its counter-revolutionary essence.

This number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is precisely the culprit who destroys the Party's principles and organizational discipline. He brazenly opposes our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, opposes the highest guiding ideology of our Party—Mao Zedong Thought, opposes the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao at the helm, opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, destroys the Party's democratic centralism, and destroys proletarian discipline. Chairman Mao says: "Experience shows: Some people who violate discipline do so because they do not know what Party discipline is; some people who deliberately violate it, such as Zhang Guotao, use the ignorance of many Party members to sell their tricks." Today's number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is a more dangerous figure than Zhang Guotao. He is precisely using slavery ideology to confuse Party members "to sell his tricks," to sell his counter-revolutionary revisionist tricks, to sell his tricks of usurping the Party and the state, to sell his tricks of restoring capitalism. How poisonous!

Another sinister purpose of China's Khrushchev's advocacy of slavery ideology is to strangle the revolution and suppress the revolutionary masses from rebelling against him, this counter-revolutionary revisionist mastermind, and rebelling against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

In the Cultural Revolution, he colluded with another number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, attempting to use slavery ideology to extinguish the blazing revolutionary flames. They created shackles such as "distinguish between insiders and outsiders," "pay attention to secrecy," and "guard the post" and put them on the necks of the revolutionary masses, striving to strangle the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses. They disguised themselves as the embodiment of the Party and, when the revolutionary masses rebelled, shouted to obey their revisionist "Party leadership." When some revolutionary pioneers broke free from the shackles of "slavery ideology" and launched fierce attacks on the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, this number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his followers picked up the broken weapons from "Self-Cultivation." "Self-Cultivation" says: "Party cadres and Party leaders are representatives of the general interests of the Party and the class." Based on this absurd point, they, these power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, self-proclaimed as the embodiment of the Party, who opposes them is anti-Party, and branded a large number of revolutionary pioneers who rebelled against them as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party," "fake leftists, true rightists," slandering them as "shooting at the proletarian headquarters." Look! The "Self-Cultivation" that advocates "tolerance and kindness" turns ruthless, becoming a butcher's knife to slaughter the revolution! But the logic of history goes in the opposite direction of what they imagined. They lifted the stone to hit their own feet. As Chairman Mao taught, "The various persecutions inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote the broader and more violent revolution of the people." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad revolutionary masses have smashed the evil plot of this number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, exposed his counter-revolutionary revisionist face. At present, this scoundrel and his followers have been surrounded by the broad revolutionary masses. "Asking the plague lord where he is going, the paper boat with a torch illuminates the sky." The great Chinese people will surely bury the counter-revolutionary slavery ideology and its advocate in the grave of history! We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely, letting the spring of revolutionary rebellion surge across the world!

    埋葬中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的奴隶主义
    毛泽东思想哲学社会科学部红卫兵联队
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，无数革命闯将，遵循毛主席的教导，高呼“造反有理”的口号，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。就在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派大肆散布“奴隶主义”的货色，以对抗毛主席的伟大号召。
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席从来就反对奴隶主义。早在一九三○年，毛主席就教导我们：对于上级领导机关的指示，“不根据实际情况进行讨论和审察，一味盲目执行，这种单纯建立在‘上级’观念上的形式主义的态度是很不对的。”一九四二年，在整风运动中，毛主席又教导我们：“对于任何东西都用鼻子嗅一嗅，鉴别其好坏，然后才决定欢迎它，或者抵制它。”“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义”。最近，毛主席还这样教导我们：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制”。在文化大革命中，毛主席这些深刻的教导，哺育了一批又一批革命的闯将，成为他们不可摧毁的精神支柱，从而经受了一次又一次大风大浪的严峻考验，夺取了一个又一个的胜利。今天，毛主席这些教导又给我们提供了对奴隶主义展开斗争的强大武器。
    奴隶主义是剥削制度的产物。几千年来，剥削阶级总是把自己打扮成天生的“主宰”，而把革命造反者丑化成大逆不道的“犯上作乱者”。“奴隶主义”的哲学就是适应剥削阶级的需要而产生的一种压制革命，腐蚀革命意志的反动哲学。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这种反动哲学最大的贩卖者。他通过大毒草《修养》和一系列的言行，把奴隶主义全面地、不断地搬到党内，长年累月地腐蚀共产党员的斗志，破坏党的革命原则，毒害党的肌体，为他篡党篡国的阴谋制造舆论，准备条件，犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底埋葬中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的反革命奴隶主义，粉碎他篡党篡国的阴谋，坚决把他拉下马，叫他靠边站！
    驳“组织上的绝对服从”的反动谬论
    毛主席教导我们，政党是“阶级斗争的工具”。“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”我们今天所以要有共产党，正是为了无产阶级实现推翻资本主义、建立社会主义和共产主义这样的政治目的。任何政党都不过是为了实现某个阶级的政治主张的一种组织形式。因此，党的组织路线应当服从政治路线，应当成为贯彻与实现党的政治路线的保证或工具。
    但是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却明目张胆地、猖狂地反对毛主席的建党原则，大肆鼓吹组织原则高于一切，政治路线要服从组织路线，提倡组织上无条件的、盲目的绝对服从。
    他叫嚷：“我们主张组织上的绝对服从。”
    他还指责有一种人的观点：“要我服从上级和多数是可以的，但上级和多数在原则上、政治上先要正确。若在政治上错了，我就不服从。这就是以多数的，或上级的，或中央的正确不正确为服从的条件。这个条件提出是不对的。”
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的这一套，是十足的反动谬论。早在四十多年以前，列宁就曾一针见血地尖锐指出：没有党的“政治领导正确，它的战略与策略正确”，“革命政党的纪律，真正能够领导先进阶级推翻资产阶级并且改造整个社会的这个政党的纪律，就不可能建立起来。”可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫宣扬什么“绝对服从”、无论政治上正确与否，都要盲目服从，其实质，就是要人们盲目地、忠实地执行他的反革命修正主义路线，为他篡党篡国、实行反革命复辟效劳。
    他还别有用心地欺骗人们说，他主张“不论对与不对都要服从”，是为了“维护党的统一”。但是，正如列宁指出的：“统一，这是伟大的事业和伟大的口号！但是，工人事业所需要的是马克思主义者的统一，而不是马克思主义者同反对和歪曲马克思主义的人的统一。”毛主席在谈到纯洁我们党的队伍时，教导我们说：“为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”因此，我们所要维护的党的统一，首先是在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基础上的统一，是在积极展开思想斗争、与一切违反毛泽东思想的言行作斗争的基础上的统一。我们党的历史和国际共产主义运动的历史证明：破坏党的统一，造成党的分裂的，从来都是各种反对和歪曲马克思主义的机会主义者和修正主义者。所以，他把破坏“党的统一”的罪名，加在不跟着他的指挥棒团团转的革命派头上的企图，是绝对不能得逞的。
    长期以来，这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派不遗余力地推行所谓“组织上的绝对服从”的奴隶主义，给党和革命事业带来了十分严重的损失。其中最突出的一个事例就是，抗日战争爆发前夕，他自认是党组织的化身，指使别人自首变节，投降国民党，叛变共产党。一些变节分子听从他的指使，抛弃革命的政治原则，公开发表“反共启事”，宣誓“坚决反共”，被他看成是“组织原则”上正确，受到了他的大力提拔，篡夺了党的许多领导地位。可是那些坚定不移的同志，在政治上毫不动摇，拒绝自首变节，反而因为没有“绝对服从”他的黑指示，而受到种种迫害和打击！这是多么恶劣的是非颠倒！这是多么荒谬的反动逻辑！他所鼓吹的“组织上的绝对服从”的奴隶主义，正是为他的反动的阶级投降主义服务的。
    这个中国的赫鲁晓夫利用“组织上的绝对服从”的反革命奴隶主义，积极推行反革命修正主义路线，对抗毛主席的正确路线，背叛革命的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算！
    不许用奴隶主义冒充党的民主集中制
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为了贩卖他的奴隶主义，不惜践踏党的民主集中制的原则，把他的“奴隶主义”冒充成我们党的民主集中制。
    民主集中制是我们党的基本组织原则。这个民主集中制是民主基础上的集中，集中指导下的民主。
    毛主席教导我们：“在组织上，厉行集中指导下的民主生活。”其路线第一条就是“党的领导机关要有正确的指导路线”。列宁也说得好：“没有共同党性基础的人们，光靠机械的少数服从多数的原则是无法进行工作的。”这些都规定了民主集中制需要有正确的指导思想、指导路线作为前提和条件。毫无疑义，这个正确的指导思想就是伟大的毛泽东思想，这个正确的指导路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    而这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派离开正确指导思想，说什么“服从组织，服从多数，服从上级，是绝对的，无条件的。”在《修养》中，他煞有介事地强调：“只要是大多数，是上级或中央通过和决定了的，就要服从，就是不对也要服从，恰恰在这个时候，特别要遵守纪律，要服从多数，要服从上级或中央，不管多数和上级或中央对与不对。”甚至说：“真理在少数人方面，而大多数人所主张的是非真理”的时候，“少数人还只有服从多数人”等等。
    服从！绝对服从！无条件服从！正确的少数也要服从错误的多数，正确的下级也要服从错误的上级，正确的个人也要绝对服从错误的组织。问不得半个为什么，否则就是“破坏党的民主集中制”，就是“破坏党的纪律”。这是什么“党的纪律”！这完全是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为维持他的反动统治而套在革命群众头上的反革命的纪律。谁都知道，共产党有真假之分，有马克思列宁主义和修正主义之分；纪律也有不同的阶级内容，有无产阶级纪律和资产阶级纪律之分，有革命纪律和反革命纪律之分。对于无产阶级革命战士来说，我们严格遵守的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党的无产阶级的革命纪律；我们无条件接受的，是以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导。对一切违反毛泽东思想、违背毛主席的革命路线的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制；对于那些资产阶级的纪律，应当彻底摧毁；坚决反对奴隶主义。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么无条件地服从多数，还有一个险恶的目的，就是配合赫鲁晓夫修正主义向我们党的进攻，妄图逼迫我们党屈从于苏修的意志，跟着赫鲁晓夫的指挥棒团团转，向修正主义投降。但是，我们伟大的领袖毛主席高举马克思列宁主义革命的旗帜，坚决地击败了赫鲁晓夫修正主义和我们党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋。七评苏共中央的公开信明确指出：“对待马克思列宁主义的根本原则问题，究竟谁对谁错，并不是在任何情况下都能根据多数或少数来判断的。”这就彻底驳斥了苏修妄图加在我们党头上的所谓“抗拒多数的意志”，“破坏国际纪律”的罪名，也粉碎了我们党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶意图。
    我们一定要彻底揭穿中国的赫鲁晓夫这种冒充党的民主集中制的奴隶主义。他的“民主集中制”，否定以毛泽东思想为指导，抽掉了革命的灵魂；借民主集中制之名，行奴隶主义之实，挂民主集中制的羊头，卖奴隶主义的狗肉。让我们以毛泽东思想为武器，把他妄图用奴隶主义冒充党的民主集中制的反动阴谋，暴露在光天化日之下。
    打倒反动的工具论
    中国的赫鲁晓夫还用更巧妙的伪装来贩卖奴隶主义，他把“共产党员的志愿”，说成是应当做“党的驯服工具”。他说：“是作驯服的工具，还是作调皮的工具呢？是作容易驾驭的工具呢，还是作不容易驾驭的工具呢？当然要作驯服的工具，要作容易驾驭的工具。”他的奴隶主义，在政治上是不讲革命原则的修正主义，在组织上是绝对的命令主义，在对待党员群众上是无头脑的工具主义！这是彻头彻尾的反毛泽东思想的反动谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”毛主席这一教导是每一个共产党员唯一正确的志愿。
    毛主席号召我们，要“放下包袱，开动机器”；提高革命的自觉性，避免陷入盲目性。毛主席对这种革命的自觉精神曾作过如下的阐述：“所谓发挥积极性，必须具体地表现在领导机关、干部和党员的创造能力，负责精神，工作的活跃，敢于和善于提出问题、发表意见、批评缺点，以及对于领导机关和领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用。”而在奴隶主义倡导者的心目中，共产党员不应该有革命的首创精神，每一个党员都要成为“象一个很精巧的工具”，成为一堆没有思想的机械。
    这种奴隶主义的工具论实际是一种愚民政策。根据这种理论，党就无须用毛泽东思想武装党员群众，无须把党的政策交给广大党员群众，无须对党员进行政治思想教育，无须提高党员的革命自觉性，而只要进行一个“绝对服从”的组织方法训练就可以了。这些奴隶主义的倡导者是十足的历史唯心主义者，他们把自己当成扭转乾坤的诸葛亮，把群众当成任人摆布的奴隶，把劳动人民的革命造反精神扼杀在这种反动的愚民政策中。这是一种彻头彻尾的法西斯理论！
    更重要的是，中国的赫鲁晓夫在这里蓄意回避了一个很重要的原则问题，即做什么党的“驯服工具”？是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党还是修正主义的党？是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部还是以这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为首的资产阶级司令部？他曾经鼓吹过：“即使大多数或上级或中央真错了，你也要服从，先照错误的去执行。”按照他的逻辑，那就是不管在什么情况下都应该做他的“驯服工具”，而且让他“使起来非常灵便，得心应手”。这套奴隶主义的工具论完全是为他进行资本主义复辟作舆论上和组织上的准备的。
    奴隶主义的反革命实质
    撕下中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹奴隶主义的种种伪装，我们就可以看穿它的反革命实质。
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派正是破坏党的原则和组织纪律的罪魁祸首。他猖狂反对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对我们党的最高指导思想——毛泽东思想，反对以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导，对抗毛主席的革命路线，破坏党的民主集中制，破坏无产阶级的纪律。毛主席说：“经验证明：有些破坏纪律的人，是由于他们不懂得什么是党的纪律；有些明知故犯的人，例如张国焘，则利用许多党员的无知以售其奸。”今天的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是比张国焘还要危险的人物，他正是利用奴隶主义来蒙昧党员“以售其奸”，售其反革命修正主义之奸，售其篡党篡国之奸，售其资本主义复辟之奸，何其毒也。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹奴隶主义的另一个阴险目的，是为了扼杀革命，压制革命群众起来造他这个反革命修正主义总后台的反，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。
    在文化大革命中，他勾结另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，妄图通过奴隶主义来扑灭熊熊的革命烈火。他们制造“内外有别”、“注意泄密”、“坚守岗位”等等枷锁，套在革命群众的脖子上，竭力扼杀革命群众的首创精神。他们把自己打扮成党的化身，在革命群众造反的时候，叫嚣服从他们修正主义“党的领导”。当一些革命闯将冲决“奴隶主义”的枷锁，向着党内走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的时候，这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其追随者又拣起了《修养》中的破烂武器。《修养》说：“党的干部和党的领导人是党和阶级的一般利益的代表者”。根据这个荒谬论点，他们这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，自封为党的化身，谁反对他们，就是反党，并且把一大批起来造他们的反的革命闯将打成“反革命”、“反党”、“假左派，真右派”，诬蔑他们“炮打无产阶级司令部”。看！主张“宽容厚道”的《修养》，翻脸无情，变成了残杀革命的屠刀！可是，历史的逻辑却向他们所设想的反面走去，他们搬起石头打自己的脚。正如毛主席所教导的那样，反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”广大革命群众，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，粉碎了这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶阴谋，揭露了他的反革命修正主义面目。目前，这个坏家伙及其追随者已经陷入广大革命群众的重重包围中。“借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。”伟大的中国人民一定要把反革命奴隶主义和他的鼓吹者，彻底送进历史的坟墓！我们将永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进，让革命造反之青春磅礴于全世界！
