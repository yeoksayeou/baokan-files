The sun rises in the east, its rays shining brightly. Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a call that shakes the world: "You must pay attention to national affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The Red Guards take the lead, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers charge forward. The red torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeps across the nation, shaking the entire world.

"Marxism-Leninism has countless principles, but in the end, it boils down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a fierce attack on all kinds of bourgeois representatives, sweeping away all monsters and demons.

Respected Chairman Mao, you are the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in our time, you are the greatest genius of our time, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts. We think of you day and night. Today, we have finally come to your side. We are the happiest people in the world.

Respected Chairman Mao, we have so much to tell you, we have so many songs to sing for you. Millions of hearts are beating fiercely, millions of smiling faces turn towards the red sun. We sincerely wish you long life and good health!

The radiance of Beijing is brilliant and magnificent. Mao Zedong is the sun of the East.

The great truth, the dawn of a new day, the savior of humanity, the hope of the world!

Follow Mao Zedong, and forever make revolution. Follow Mao Zedong, and the world will be red!

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time, it is our guiding principle for all work. All the achievements and victories of our people are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our soul, it is our lifeblood. Anyone who dares to oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow them.

We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to turn our great motherland into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible in the world.

Chairman Mao leads us from victory to victory. Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a brand new and creative revolution after the proletariat seizes power, it is Chairman Mao's great contribution to the world proletarian revolution.

Respected Chairman Mao, you are our supreme commander, you have great expectations for us. We will definitely pass on and carry forward Mao Zedong Thought. The imperialists and revisionists think they can change our third and fourth generations, but they are wrong! The great Mao Zedong Thought is cultivating us into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely oppose imperialism, revisionism, and the bourgeoisie, and uproot them completely.

Respected Chairman Mao, you are our closest kin, you support our revolution the most, you support our rebellion the most. In the days of white terror created by the bourgeois reactionary line, thinking of you, we see clearly; thinking of you, our will is like steel; thinking of you, we are full of strength!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, father and mother are not as dear as you, the river is deep and the sea is deep, but not as deep as your kindness.

Respected Chairman Mao, you support us, and we will make you proud! We are determined to thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line, and to defend your proletarian revolutionary line and your great thought to the death. We will forever follow you, no matter the mountains of knives or seas of fire, we will not be deterred, even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, our hearts will not change!

Thousands of rivers flow into the sea, all roads lead to Beijing, the hearts of the people across the nation are with you, respected leader Chairman Mao!

Respected leader, great teacher, you love the people boundlessly, and the people love you boundlessly.

In the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, we celebrate the happiest night in the world, singing songs of praise to Chairman Mao with all our hearts.

Respected Chairman Mao, no matter how many times we shout, it cannot express our boundless love for you, no matter how many times we sing, it cannot exhaust our boundless admiration for you.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and complete the great historical task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

We will create a brilliant new world. The sky is Mao Zedong Thought, the earth is Mao Zedong Thought, the people are heroes standing tall and proud, armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Sing out loud! By the side of our great leader Chairman Mao, we sing the loudest and most beautiful songs in the world.

Respected Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts that never sets.

We sincerely wish our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao long life and good health! Long life and good health!
