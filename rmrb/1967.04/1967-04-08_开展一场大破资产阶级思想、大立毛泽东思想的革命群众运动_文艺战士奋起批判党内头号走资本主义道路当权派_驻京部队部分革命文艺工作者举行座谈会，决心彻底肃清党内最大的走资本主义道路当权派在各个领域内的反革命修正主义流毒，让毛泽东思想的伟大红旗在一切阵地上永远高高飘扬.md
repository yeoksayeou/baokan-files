Literary warriors rise up to criticize the top capitalist-roaders within the Party
Revolutionary literary workers from some units of the Beijing garrison hold a symposium, determined to thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of the top capitalist-roader within the Party in all fields, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on all fronts

	The important article "Patriotism or Treachery?" published in the journal "Red Flag" has sparked a tremendous response among the literary units of the Beijing garrison. On the 4th, the editorial department of the "Liberation Army Daily" invited comrades from the "Pursue the Enemy Revolutionary Rebel Corps" of the General Political Department's Literary and Art Troupe, the "Spark of Revolution Revolutionary Rebel Corps" of the Military Academy of Art, the "Red Rebel Corps" of the Railway Engineering Corps Literary and Art Troupe, and the "Red Rebel Corps in the Snow" of the Engineering Corps Literary and Art Troupe to hold a symposium. The revolutionary literary workers present, with indignation, exposed the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They unanimously declared that they would definitely smash the conspiracy of this revisionist mastermind hidden within the Party, who is like Khrushchev sleeping next to us, to restore capitalism in China, and ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies all fronts, guaranteeing that our great motherland will never change color!

	Dig out the mastermind behind the restoration of capitalism in China

	The comrades participating in the symposium believed that the publication of the important article "Patriotism or Treachery?" is not just a criticism of a reactionary film, but through the criticism of this counter-revolutionary film, it exposes and criticizes the ugly face and heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party in restoring capitalism in China. It concerns the fate and future of our Party and state, and the fate and future of the revolutionary people of the world.

	Everyone reviewed the historical facts of the seventeen years since the founding of New China, where the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have been in a fierce struggle, further realizing that the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the reactionary line represented by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, have been in a fierce struggle over major issues such as what kind of state to build, what path to take, and to which class the fruits of the revolution belong. This struggle has been long-standing and is reflected in politics, economics, culture, education, and other aspects. Chairman Mao teaches us: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. Some comrades, in connection with the situation on the literary front, pointed out that literature and art, as part of the superstructure, are the "barometer" of class struggle. In the seventeen years since the founding of New China, whenever class struggle sharpens, it is almost always reflected in literature and art. Due to the complexity of class struggle, many problems were not easy to understand in the past, and many phenomena were not seen through their essence. For example, why was it always interfered with and resisted when Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us to grasp class struggle and to let politics take command in all sectors? Why could the ghosts and snakes in the literary world be so rampant in their repeated attacks and counterattacks? Where is the root of the problem? Through the study of "Patriotism or Treachery?", everyone further clarified that the mastermind behind the conspiracy to restore capitalism is the top capitalist-roader within the Party, the Khrushchev of China.

	Can all revolutionary comrades allow his evil conspiracy to succeed? No! Absolutely not! We must, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, organize a vast army of proletarian cultural revolutionaries to seize back all the departments they have usurped, making the iron-clad socialist mountains and rivers forever red for thousands of generations. Cut off the black hands of the top capitalist-roader within the Party reaching into the military literary front

	The comrades participating in the symposium unanimously believed: In the past seventeen years, Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line has been dominant in our military literary work; however, the top capitalist-roader within the Party has also extended his black hands into the military literary front through the departments he controls, producing serious influences in some literary units. In military literary work, there is also a struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois lines.

	The top capitalist-roader within the Party, through a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, on the one hand, sings the theory of the extinction of class struggle, saying that military literary work "no longer has a direction problem" but is only a problem of "raising artistic standards"; on the other hand, on this front, he promotes "big, foreign, old" and performs "feudal, bourgeois, revisionist" works. Under the impact of this bourgeois literary black line, some literary units have deviated from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do not serve proletarian politics, but engage in a hodgepodge of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, creating public opinion to prepare for the restoration of capitalism.

	During the symposium, some comrades exposed: The top capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists supported by him, in order to resist Chairman Mao's teaching that all work must be commanded by proletarian politics, actually adopted conciliatory tactics, wanting literature to serve "politics realized in business." They promoted bourgeois military lines, deliberately distorted proletarian politics, and attempted to lead our great leader Mao Zedong's personally created proletarian army astray. In 1964, the top capitalist-roader within the Party even personally extended his black hands into the military, appearing in the guise of a "leader of the working class," wanting the military to perform the so-called "bloodline of the working class," attempting to build monuments for himself and challenge our great leader Mao Zedong.

	To promote the bourgeois literary black line, the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists supported by him also attempted to control the construction of the military literary team. They listed the black goods of the "ancestors" of the 1930s as compulsory reading materials; they took "going abroad and becoming famous" as the direction of the troupe's efforts. Under the pretext of cultivating "elite actors," they corrupted the young generation with counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. The comrades present expressed the greatest indignation at these retrograde and counter-revolutionary crimes!

	Thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist "spiritual shackles" of "Cultivation"

	During the symposium, everyone believed: The top capitalist-roader within the Party, with his "Cultivation" as the "theoretical" basis, instilled revisionist, capitalist, and feudalist poison into Party members and cadres, attempting to turn our Party into a revisionist party, achieving his evil goal of restoring capitalism.

	Some comrades said, "Cultivation" is indeed a deception, a big poisonous weed. Before the Cultural Revolution, some counter-revolutionary revisionists strongly promoted "Cultivation," using it as a "magic pill" for the "thought construction" of the literary team, praising it as the "elixir" for becoming an "active member," "model," "Party member," or "League member." They bound some people in the small circle of individualism, closed the door to cultivate themselves, "examine oneself three times," "hear nothing outside the window," detached from reality, detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, detached from the fiery class struggle, and pursued only personal fame and gain, becoming tools for their restoration of capitalism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must question everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, see if it is in line with reality, see if it is reasonable, and must not blindly follow, must not advocate slavery." The comrades present, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, strongly criticized the blind following and slavery advocated in "Cultivation." Everyone talked about how "Cultivation" contradicts Chairman Mao, advocating bourgeois goods such as "tolerance," "bending over backwards," "enduring humiliation," etc. It makes people "cautious and refined," "gentle and modest," "respectful, frugal, and yielding." They are afraid of everything, dare not think, dare not speak, dare not revolt. In the Cultural Revolution, those who were most deeply poisoned by "Cultivation" were often the ones most deeply deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line.

	Everyone unanimously declared: We must take up the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist "spiritual shackles" of "Cultivation," and bravely throw ourselves into the great waves of class struggle, forging ourselves into steadfast warriors of the proletariat. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought

	Forever fly high

	The comrades participating in the symposium unanimously believed that the top capitalist-roader within the Party has long been promoting capitalist goods in various aspects, stubbornly promoting the bourgeois reactionary line, ultimately aiming to restore capitalism.

	Everyone analyzed the current situation of class struggle in the Cultural Revolution, believing that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory, and the situation is very good. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party and his accomplices are still making a last stand, counterattacking, and attempting to overthrow the proletarian revolutionary faction and negate the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under these circumstances, the proletarian revolutionary faction faces the question of whether to carry the revolution through to the end or to give up halfway. The important article "Patriotism or Treachery?" uses the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to point out to us: We must definitely adhere to revolutionary principles, carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and absolutely not give up halfway. We must firmly grasp the literary front in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction and absolutely not let it fall into the hands of the Khrushchev of China.

	"One should pursue the enemy to the end, and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The comrades participating in the symposium unanimously declared: We are willing to be skinned alive, and we must definitely pull down the top capitalist-roader within the Party and make him step aside. Thoroughly dig out the counter-revolutionary revisionist mastermind, thoroughly smash their bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly purge their various poisons, and thoroughly extinguish their dying struggles. We must plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts, let it fly high, and let it fly forever.

    开展一场大破资产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想的革命群众运动
    文艺战士奋起批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    驻京部队部分革命文艺工作者举行座谈会，决心彻底肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在各个领域内的反革命修正主义流毒，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在一切阵地上永远高高飘扬
    本报讯　《红旗》杂志发表的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》，在驻京部队文艺团体中引起了巨大的反响。四日，《解放军报》编辑部邀请了总政治部文工团“追穷寇革命造反团”、解放军艺术学院“星火燎原革命造反队”、铁道兵文工团“红色造反团”和工程兵文工团“傲霜雪红色造反团”等单位的部分同志进行座谈。到会的革命文艺工作者以满腔的愤怒，揭露党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。一致表示，对这个潜藏在党内的修正主义的总后台，睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫，一定要彻底粉碎他在中国搞复辟资本主义的阴谋，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证我们伟大祖国永不变色！
    挖出在中国搞资本主义复辟的总后台
    参加座谈的同志认为，《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章的发表，决不仅仅是对一部反动电影的批判，而是通过批判这部反革命影片，揭露和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在中国搞资本主义复辟的丑恶面目和滔天罪行。它关系到我们党和国家的命运和前途，关系到世界革命人民的命运和前途。
    大家回顾了新中国成立十七年来无产阶级与资产阶级针锋相对，反复较量的历史事实，进一步认识到，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，围绕着建立什么性质的国家，走什么样的道路，革命的胜利果实归于哪个阶级等等重大问题，进行的激烈斗争由来已久，这种斗争表现在政治、经济、文化、教育等各个方面。毛主席教导我们：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。一些同志联系文艺战线的情况指出，作为上层建筑的文学艺术，是反映阶级斗争的“晴雨表”。新中国成立十七年来，每当阶级斗争尖锐化，几乎都是从文学艺术上展开的。由于阶级斗争错综复杂，过去有许多问题不容易理解，有许多现象看不透本质。比如，毛主席反复教导我们要抓阶级斗争，各行各业都要政治挂帅等等，可是，为什么总是受到干扰和抵制？文艺界的牛鬼蛇神为什么能够这么猖狂地不断地进攻和反扑？问题的根子究竟在哪里？通过学习《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》大家进一步明确，原来搞资本主义复辟阴谋的罪魁祸首就是这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    一切革命的同志难道能够让他的罪恶阴谋得逞吗？不能！绝对不能！我们一定要在毛泽东思想的指引下，组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命的文化大军，把他们篡夺的一切部门统统夺回来，使社会主义的铁打江山千秋万代永远鲜红。斩断党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伸向军队文艺阵地的黑手
    参加座谈的同志一致认为：十七年来，毛主席的革命文艺路线在我们军队文艺工作中占着统治地位；但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，也通过他所控制的部门把黑手伸向军队文艺阵地，在一些文艺单位中产生了严重的影响。在军队文艺工作中，也存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的斗争。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，通过一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一方面大唱阶级斗争熄灭论，说什么军队文艺工作“不存在方向问题”了，就是“提高艺术水平的问题”了；另一方面又在这个战线上，大搞“大、洋、古”，大演“封、资、修”。在这股资产阶级文艺黑线的冲击下，一些文艺单位脱离工农兵，不为无产阶级政治服务，搞的是封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的大杂烩，为资本主义复辟制造舆论准备。
    座谈中一些同志揭露：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其支持下的反革命修正主义分子，为了对抗毛主席关于一切工作都要实行无产阶级政治挂帅的教导，竟然采取折中主义的手法，要文艺为“政治落实于业务”服务。他们大搞资产阶级军事路线的货色，极力歪曲无产阶级政治，妄图把我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的无产阶级军队引向邪路。一九六四年，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，还亲自把黑手伸向军队。俨然以“工人阶级领袖”的姿态出现，要军队大演所谓“血统的工人阶级”，妄图为自己树碑立传，同我们伟大领袖毛主席分庭抗礼。
    为了推行资产阶级的文艺黑线，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其支持下的反革命修正主义分子，还妄图极力控制军队文艺队伍的建设。他们把三十年代那些“祖师爷”的黑货，列为必读教材；把“出国、出名”当作剧团的努力方向。在所谓培养“尖子演员”的名义下，用反革命修正主义的毒素腐蚀年青的一代。到会同志对这些倒行逆施的反革命罪行表示最大的愤慨！彻底打碎《修养》这个反革命
    修正主义“精神枷锁”
    座谈中，大家认为：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，以他的《修养》作为“理论”基础，向党员和干部灌输修正主义、资本主义和封建主义的思想毒素，妄图把我们的党改造成为修正主义的党，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    一些同志说，《修养》一书的确是欺人之谈，是株害人的大毒草。在文化大革命以前，一些反革命修正主义分子，强力推行《修养》，把它作为文艺队伍“思想建设”的“法宝”，把它誉为当“积极分子”、“模范”、“入党入团”的“仙丹妙药”。把一些人束缚在个人主义的小圈子里，闭门修养，“三省吾身”，“两耳不闻窗外事”，脱离实际，脱离工农兵，脱离火热的阶级斗争，一心只追求个人名利，为他们搞资本主义复辟当工具。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”到会同志根据毛主席的教导，对《修养》中提倡的盲从和奴隶主义进行了有力的批判。大家谈到，《修养》和毛主席唱反调，大力提倡什么“容忍”呀，什么“委曲求全”呀，什么“忍辱负重”呀等等资产阶级黑货。把人“修”得谨小慎微，文质彬彬，温良恭俭让。遇事“怕”字当头，不敢想，不敢说，不敢革命。在文化大革命中，凡是受《修养》毒害最深的人，往往也是受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽最深的人。
    大家一致表示：一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底打碎《修养》这个反革命修正主义的“精神枷锁”，勇敢地投入到阶级斗争的大风浪中，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的坚强战士。让毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    永远高高飘扬
    参加座谈的同志一致认为，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，竭力地吹捧卖国主义的影片《清宫秘史》和修正主义的《修养》，长期地在各个方面推行资本主义的黑货，顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，归根结底，就是要实行资本主义复辟。
    大家分析了现阶段文化大革命的阶级斗争形势，认为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经取得了决定性的胜利，形势好得很。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其同伙，还在负隅顽抗，反攻倒算，企图搞垮无产阶级革命派，否定无产阶级文化大革命。在这种情况下，无产阶级革命派面临着是将革命进行到底，还是半途而废的大问题。《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器，向我们指出：一定要坚持革命原则，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，绝不能半途而废。一定要把文艺阵地牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，绝不能落到中国的赫鲁晓夫手里。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。参加座谈的同志一致表示：我们舍得一身剐，一定要把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，叫他靠边站。彻底挖掉反革命修正主义的总后台，彻底粉碎他们的资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清他们的各种流毒，彻底扑灭他们的垂死挣扎。我们一定要把伟大的毛泽东思想红旗插在一切阵地上，让她高高地飘扬，永远地飘扬。
