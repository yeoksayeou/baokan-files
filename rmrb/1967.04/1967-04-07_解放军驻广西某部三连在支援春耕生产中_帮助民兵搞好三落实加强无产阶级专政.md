The Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi has actively assisted in spring ploughing production, helping the militia to implement three key measures and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution in rural areas and spring ploughing production.

Since the start of the Cultural Revolution in rural areas, various revolutionary organizations such as the Red Guards have been established. Some people mistakenly believe that the role of the militia has diminished. After learning about this situation, the Third Company organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the militia, helping everyone to understand that the militia is an important tool for class struggle and for safeguarding and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is also the "weapon" in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the complex class struggle, the role of the militia must be fully utilized. Militiaman Wei Zhaocheng said, "The class enemy hates and fears the militia the most. We must never put down our 'weapon'." With the help of the PLA soldiers, a political review of the militia was conducted, and new classes, platoons, and companies were reorganized. Politically reliable and loyal poor and lower-middle peasants were selected to serve as militia cadres.

After the militia organization was strengthened, the Party branch of the Third Company focused on addressing various ideological issues within the militia, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve their problems. The PLA soldiers discovered that some militiamen were afraid of patrolling and standing guard, and were reluctant to endure hardships. Therefore, they organized activities to recall past sufferings and conduct vivid class struggle education, helping them understand why they should be militiamen, for whom they should be militiamen, and for whom they should patrol and stand guard. Some militiamen believed that, with the ongoing Cultural Revolution, the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists had become "tamer" and "more obedient." In response to this thought, the Third Company organized the militia to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings: "After the armed enemies have been eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist. They will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us, and we must not underestimate these enemies." They also studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, helping everyone to further understand that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, are still alive and their spirits are not dead. They will continue to plot various schemes to sabotage spring ploughing production and the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, vigilance must be heightened, defenses must be strengthened, and the enemy's sabotage activities must be prevented and struck down at any time.

In assisting the militia to implement organizational and political measures, the Third Company also helped the militia to implement military measures, teaching them necessary military skills, and studying together articles such as "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party." This strengthened the militia's organizational discipline and combat effectiveness.

    解放军驻广西某部三连在支援春耕生产中
    帮助民兵搞好三落实加强无产阶级专政
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻广西某部三连，在支援春耕生产中，积极帮助民兵搞好三落实，有力地保证了农村无产阶级文化大革命和春耕生产的顺利进行。
    农村无产阶级文化大革命开始后，红卫兵等革命组织纷纷建立起来，有些人错误地认为民兵组织作用不大了。三连同志了解到这种情况后，立即组织社员学习了毛主席有关民兵方面的论述，使大家认识到：民兵是进行阶级斗争，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的重要工具，也是贫下中农手里的“刀把子”。在复杂的阶级斗争中，更应该发挥民兵的战斗作用。民兵韦照称说：“阶级敌人最恨民兵，最怕民兵。我们千万不能放下‘刀把子’。”在解放军战士帮助下，对民兵进行政治审查，重新编出班、排、连，挑选政治可靠、忠于毛主席的贫下中农社员担任了民兵干部。
    民兵的组织健全起来后，三连党支部又大抓民兵的各种活思想，用毛泽东思想解决他们的思想问题。解放军战士发现个别民兵怕巡逻放哨，怕吃苦受累，于是就组织大家忆苦思甜，进行生动的阶级斗争的教育，帮助他们懂得为什么当民兵，为谁当民兵，为谁巡逻放哨。有些民兵认为，目前正在大搞文化革命，地、富、反、坏、右分子比过去“乖了”，“老实了”。针对这种思想，三连同志便组织民兵认真地学习毛主席的教导：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”以及毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，使大家进一步认识到：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，人还在，心不死，他们还会玩弄种种阴谋破坏春耕生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。因此一定要提高警惕，加强戒备，严防敌人的破坏活动，随时给阶级敌人以有力打击。
    三连同志在帮助民兵搞好组织、政治落实中，还帮助民兵搞好军事落实，给他们传授必要的军事技术，和他们一起学习《三大纪律八项注意》《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文章，加强民兵的组织纪律性和战斗性。
