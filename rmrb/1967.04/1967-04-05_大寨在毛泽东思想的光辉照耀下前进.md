The red flag of Dazhai was raised in the stormy struggle against nature, against the land, and against class enemies, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory, every achievement, has been won through arduous struggle under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no victories in struggle, no Dazhai today.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought Dazhai's revolution and construction into a new stage. Together with the revolutionary masses of various places, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the provincial, regional, and county Party committees. We have taken the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the destiny of the socialist economy, and the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into our own hands.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee have long harbored deep hatred for Dazhai, which insists on the socialist road. They have colluded from top to bottom, using every means to oppose Dazhai, attempting to cut down the red flag personally raised by our great leader Chairman Mao, in order to achieve their evil goal of opposing Mao Zedong Thought and restoring capitalism. The people of Dazhai have engaged in long-term struggles with them. This is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between adhering to Mao Zedong Thought and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

As early as 1961, they used various means to oppose Dazhai, spreading rumors that Dazhai's achievements were not genuine, and sending people to inspect the land, production, and completion of state procurement tasks in Dazhai, deliberately trying to tarnish the red flag of Dazhai. In 1964, they took advantage of the socialist education movement in the countryside, mobilizing troops and dispatching work teams to try to destroy Dazhai. As soon as the work team entered the village, they directed the struggle against revolutionary grassroots cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, stubbornly implementing a "left" in form, right in essence line.

At the beginning of the movement, they regarded the unity of our Party branch and the unity of the poor and lower-middle peasants as an abnormal phenomenon, saying they had never seen such a thing, and that there must be a problem. The reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie blinded them, making it impossible for them to understand that the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are united and indestructible. They held big and small meetings, causing trouble for more than two months, forcing the poor and lower-middle peasants to speak ill of the cadres and expose the "inner workings" of the Party branch. Under the firm resistance of our Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants, they gained nothing.

When they had no other recourse, they again used the pretext that Dazhai was different from some other brigades to persecute us. Indeed, Dazhai is different from those brigades controlled by capitalist-roaders. Dazhai has poor natural conditions and suffers disasters nine out of ten years, but we have never asked the state for anything. We only want Mao Zedong Thought, and with Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. We resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance, struggle hard, change the heavens and the earth, and use our own hands to build a prosperous socialist new countryside out of a barren mountain valley. We engage in production, strive for bumper harvests, and produce more grain to support national construction and world revolution, not to keep more and divide more, only caring for ourselves and ignoring the collective and the state. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." We emphasize politics, focus on political and ideological work, and have created a set of management systems that are conducive to cultivating the collectivist spirit of the members and giving full play to the initiative of the members. In Dazhai, we eagerly take on heavy work and collectively manage everything. Our production has greatly increased, and the living standards of the members have also greatly improved. However, our members firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "thrift and opposition to waste" for building the country through hard work and frugality. We live frugally, work hard in production, and save for revolution.

Why do they pick on these things to persecute us? In short, they want to make us the same as them and walk the capitalist road. This is a vain hope. The people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have clear minds, sharp eyes, strong bones, and firm positions. They have withstood the black winds and evil waves and insisted on the socialist road.

After their attacks failed, they came out to seize our power, taking away the power of the Party, the Youth League, and the militia. To deceive the masses, they shamelessly said that there were worms under the red flag of Dazhai, and if they were not removed, the red flag could not be held high. In fact, they are the real worms that harm the red flag of Dazhai. They kicked out the Dazhai Party branch, which is deeply loved by the masses, and promoted some landlords, rich peasants, anti-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, pulling in some members to form a special production team to oppose the poor and lower-middle peasants. They persecuted the poor and lower-middle peasants, labeling some of the masses who opposed them as "active counter-revolutionaries" and "degenerate elements," and practicing bourgeois dictatorship. They messed up production. I arranged for a 20-day production task before going to Beijing for a meeting, but they took 80 days and still did not complete it. The newly built stone dams were washed away by a small spring rain, not only was a winter's labor wasted, but the old land was also destroyed. This handful of people in Dazhai did nothing good and caused endless trouble.

Chairman Mao understands us the best and cares for us the most. At the crucial moment of struggle, he received me in Beijing and gave important instructions on the work of Dazhai. Premier Zhou also, on behalf of Chairman Mao, issued a great call to the whole country to learn from Dazhai in agriculture at the First Session of the Fourth National People's Congress. This is the greatest encouragement, the most affectionate care, and the strongest support for us. We stood tall, fought resolutely, and finally drove away the work team that tried to cut down the red flag of Dazhai. The central authorities sent a new work team, which firmly implemented the "Twenty-three Articles" personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, and worked with our Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out the "Four Cleanups." In just over 30 days, the problems were clarified, and it was proven that Dazhai, in political, ideological, organizational, and economic aspects, was acting in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, walking the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

However, the class enemies are not willing to admit defeat. As Chairman Mao taught us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." After the previous work team was driven away, they secretly instructed people to bring false materials to Dazhai, fabricate rumors, and try to deceive the central authorities with such despicable means. But the truth cannot be hidden. After 56 days of measurement by more than 70 people from the provincial, regional, county, commune, and surrounding brigades, it was proven that Dazhai did not hide a single mu of land, but actually lacked a few mu; after weighing and verification, the grain output was not inflated by a single ounce. The iron facts once again smashed their evil plots.

Not only that, they used the method of establishing fake advanced units to oppose Chairman Mao's great call to learn from Dazhai in agriculture. They promoted some revisionist seedlings and brigades that were rampantly engaged in capitalist activities as models, publicizing and promoting them everywhere, trying to lead the people's commune astray.

While fiercely opposing Dazhai, they also struck at the revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County. Those comrades who resolutely fought against their crimes of opposing the Three Red Banners and Dazhai were all labeled as members of the "anti-Party clique." I exposed and opposed their crimes, so they hated and feared me and also wanted to label me as a member of the "anti-Party clique."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has ignited the flames of attacking the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The time for a decisive battle with this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party has come. I resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, exposing their anti-Party crimes and rebelling against them. Under the inspiration of the "January Revolution" storm, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, together with the revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and the People's Liberation Army of Xiyang County, seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county Party committee and the county people's committee, and carried out a thorough exposure and settlement of their counter-revolutionary crimes.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of Xiyang County has entered a new stage after seizing power. To adapt to the requirements of the new situation and firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," we are vigorously promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological revolution of the people. The ideological revolution of the people is to arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, so that every member can use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. How did Dazhai repel the attacks of class enemies, withstand wave after wave of anti-Dazhai black winds? How did we overcome natural disasters, change the heavens and the earth, and overcome difficulties? Was it because the people of Dazhai were particularly intelligent and skilled? No, not at all. It was because we relied on Mao Zedong Thought, the ideological revolution of the people. With the revolutionary people of Dazhai, there are high-yield fields in Dazhai. Only when people change, can the land change, production change, and the village change. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have boundless strength and wisdom. In class struggle, they are invincible and can crush any enemy without being crushed by the enemy; in production struggle, they can overcome all difficulties, change the heavens and the earth, and create miracles on earth. Currently, a new high tide of learning from Chairman Mao's works, breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, and promoting the ideological revolution of the people is forming.

For those who insist on a reactionary stance, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, we only allow them to behave properly, not to talk nonsense or cause trouble, and certainly not to use the name of the Cultural Revolution to carry out counter-attacks and class revenge. We poor and lower-middle peasants are the masters of the rural people's commune and the main force of the rural Cultural Revolution and agricultural production. We must stand at the forefront of the struggle to protect our revolution and production from being disrupted and destroyed by class enemies.

The revolutionary masses are most concerned about production, love labor the most, and understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" the best, and implement it the most resolutely. We not only actively participate in the Cultural Revolution and become revolutionary pioneers but also use the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the struggle and apply it to production. After the autumn harvest last year, the people of Dazhai immediately launched intensive agricultural basic construction. We fear neither the cold nor the hardship, everyone takes to the field, and everyone works every day. After a winter of hard work, we have repaired all the land in the seven major gullies destroyed by the summer floods, built new stone dams, and thickened the soil layer. At the same time, we also treated a chaotic stone gully, built 12 new stone dams, and expanded the cultivated land area. We also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer and did other preparatory work for spring plowing. The results of this winter's labor are better than any other year. This has created reliable conditions for achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

Now, the spring plowing is in full swing. Spring plowing production is related to the yield of the entire year's agricultural production, related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," related to the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and related to the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is indeed very important. This is not only a production task but also a major political task. Whether or not to do a good job in production is a class struggle, a struggle between two lines. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have sent a letter to us poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, which is the greatest concern and highest instruction for us. We poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we enthusiastically respond to and firmly support the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County held a rally in Dazhai to launch a spring plowing production high tide to "grasp revolution, promote production." This is a great encouragement and inspiration for us in Dazhai and a great promotion for the revolution and production of Xiyang County.

The people of Dazhai are putting forth greater revolutionary enthusiasm to achieve new results and respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's concern for us and the encouragement of the people of the whole country. We mobilize all possible forces to actively participate in spring plowing production. A hot and solid spring plowing production high tide is emerging in our Dazhai. In terms of transforming nature, this year we have new measures to bring water from a reservoir seven miles away into Dazhai and onto the hills, turning 400 mu of dry land that relies on rain into irrigated land that does not rely on rain, changing from one crop a year to two crops a year. The People's Liberation Army not only actively supports us in making revolution but also actively supports us in production and construction. In the project of bringing water up the mountain, they have given us great help.

Dazhai is advancing under the guidance of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the push of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We know that there will still be various difficulties and class enemy counterattacks and natural disasters on the road ahead. However, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing and can overcome any difficulty. Dazhai will forever advance under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

    大寨在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下前进
    大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    我们大寨这面红旗，是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人斗的风浪里出现的，是在斗争中前进的。我们的每一个胜利，每一点成绩，都是在毛主席亲切教导下，经过艰苦奋斗取得的。有了毛泽东思想，才有斗争的胜利，才有今天的大寨。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使我们大寨的革命和建设进入了一个崭新的阶段。我们大寨的贫下中农同各地的无产阶级革命派一起，向省、地、县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把无产阶级专政的命运，把社会主义经济的命运和无产阶级文化大革命的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。
    山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对坚持走社会主义道路的大寨十分仇视。他们上下勾结，用尽各种办法反对大寨，妄想砍倒由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立起来的这面红旗，以达到他们反对毛泽东思想、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们大寨人，同他们进行过长期的斗争。这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是坚持毛泽东思想和反对毛泽东思想的斗争。
    早在一九六一年，他们就采取各种手段反对大寨，散布谣言，说大寨成绩不真实，并派人到大寨查土地、查产量、查完成国家统购任务的情况，有意往大寨这面红旗上抹黑。一九六四年，他们利用农村社会主义教育运动的机会，调兵遣将，派出工作组，妄图整垮大寨。工作组一进村，就把斗争的矛头指向革命的基层干部和广大贫下中农，顽固地执行形“左”实右的路线。
    运动一开始，他们把我们党支部的团结、贫下中农的团结，看成是一种不正常的现象，说他们从来没有见过，这里边一定有问题。资产阶级的反动立场迷了他们的心窍，使他们不可能理解，用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农就是团结，就是什么力量也拆不散。他们开大会小会，折腾了两个多月，硬逼着贫下中农说干部的坏话，揭党支部的“内幕”。在我们党支部和贫下中农的坚决抵制下，他们什么也没捞着。
    他们实在没有办法了，又借口大寨什么都和某些大队不一样来整我们。对着哩！我们大寨就是同那些被走资本主义道路的当权派所把持的大队不一样。我们大寨自然条件不好，十年九受灾，可是，从来不伸手向国家要这要那。我们只要毛泽东思想，有了毛泽东思想，就有了一切。我们坚决执行毛主席的自力更生的方针，艰苦奋斗，改天换地，用自己的双手，把一个一穷二白的山沟沟，建设成富裕兴旺的社会主义新农村。我们搞生产，夺丰收，多打粮食，是为了支援国家建设和世界革命，而不是多留多分，只管自己，不顾集体和国家。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们突出政治，抓政治思想工作，创造了一套有利于培养社员集体主义精神、发挥社员积极性的经营管理制度。在我们大寨，是重活抢着干，集体大家管。我们的生产有很大提高，社员生活也有很大改善，但是，我们社员坚决执行毛主席的“厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针”。勤俭过日子，艰苦搞生产，节约闹革命。
    他们为什么抓住这些整我们呢？说穿了，就是要把我们整得同他们一个样，也走资本主义道路。这是妄想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，心最明，眼最亮，骨头最硬，立场最坚定，顶住了黑风恶浪，坚持走社会主义道路。
    他们的这些进攻失败后，就跳出来夺我们的权，把党的、团的、民兵的权力都夺过去了。为了欺骗群众，他们厚着脸皮说，大寨的红旗底下生了虫虫，不挖掉，红旗不能高举。其实，他们这伙人才是真正咬大寨红旗的害人虫。他们把深受群众拥护的大寨党支部一脚踢开，重用一些地、富分子，拉拢一些社员，专门成立一个生产组，同贫下中农对抗。他们对贫下中农进行迫害，把一些反对他们的群众打成“现行反革命”、“变质分子”，大行其资产阶级专政。他们把生产搞得一塌糊涂。我去北京开会前安排了二十天生产任务，他们搞了八十天都没有完成。刚垒起的石坝，到春天一场小雨就给冲倒，不仅一冬天的劳动白干了，连旧有的土地也毁了。这一小撮人在大寨真是好事没办，坏事不断。
    毛主席最了解我们，最关心我们。在斗争最关键的时刻，他老人家在北京接见了我，并对大寨工作作了重要指示。周总理还在全国人民代表大会上代表毛主席向全国发出农业学大寨的伟大号召。这是对我们最大的鼓舞，最亲切的关怀，最有力的支持。我们挺起腰杆，坚决斗争，终于把妄想砍倒大寨红旗的这个工作组赶跑。中央派来了新的工作队，新的工作队坚决执行我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“二十三条”，同我们党支部、贫下中农一起搞四清。只经过三十多天，问题弄清楚了，我们大寨在政治、思想、组织、经济各方面，都是按照毛主席和党中央的指示办的，走的是毛主席指引的路，举的是毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    但是，阶级敌人并不甘心失败。正如毛主席教导我们的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”在前工作组被赶跑之后，他们又暗地里指使人到大寨搞假材料，编造谣言，说大寨隐瞒土地，虚报产量，妄想以这种卑劣的手段欺骗中央。但是，纸包不住火。经过省、地、县、公社和周围兄弟大队七十多人历时五十六天的丈量，证明大寨土地不但没有隐瞒一分，而且还缺好几亩；经过过秤核实，粮食产量没有虚报一两。铁的事实再一次粉碎了他们的罪恶阴谋。
    明枪暗箭还不算，他们还用树立假先进单位的手法，来对抗毛主席提出的农业学大寨的伟大号召。他们扶植一些修正主义的苗子和猖狂进行资本主义活动的大队，当作样板，到处宣扬推广，妄图把人民公社引向邪路。
    他们在大反大寨的同时，还对昔阳县的革命干部下毒手。那些同他们反对三面红旗、反对大寨的罪行作坚决斗争的同志，统统被打成“反党集团”的成员。我揭发和反对他们的这些罪行，他们就十分恨我怕我，也想把我打成“反党集团”的成员。
    无产阶级文化大革命，点燃了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进攻的烈火。同党内这一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决战的时刻到来了。我坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，同广大贫下中农和革命干部一起，揭发他们的反党罪行，造他们的反。在“一月革命”风暴的鼓舞下，我们大寨的贫下中农，同昔阳县的革命群众组织、革命领导干部和人民解放军一起，夺了县委、县人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，对他们的反革命罪行进行彻底的揭发和清算。
    昔阳县的无产阶级文化大革命，在夺权后进入了一个新阶段。为了适应新形势的要求，坚决执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，我们大抓活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。人的思想革命化，就是用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，使每一个社员都能用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。我们大寨在过去靠什么打退阶级敌人的进攻，顶住一股又一股反大寨的黑风？靠什么战胜自然灾害的袭击？靠什么克服困难、改天换地呢？是因为我们大寨人特别聪明、特别有本事吗？不是，完全不是。我们靠的是毛泽东思想，是人的思想革命化。有了革命的大寨人，才有高产的大寨田。只有人变，才有地变，生产变，村庄变。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，有用不完的力量和智慧，在阶级斗争中，就无往而不胜，能够压倒任何敌人，而不为敌人所压倒；在生产斗争中，就能够排除万难，改天换地，创造出人间的奇迹。目前，一个活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字、大立公字，促进人的思想革命化的新高潮正在形成。
    对坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，只准他们规规矩矩，不准他们乱说乱动，更不准他们借文化大革命之名，进行反攻倒算和阶级报复。我们贫下中农是农村人民公社的主人，是农村文化大革命和农业生产的主力军，就是要站在斗争的最前列，保卫我们的革命和生产不受阶级敌人的扰乱和破坏。
    无产阶级革命派，最关心生产，也最热爱劳动，最了解毛主席关于
  “抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大意义，贯彻执行也最坚决。我们不仅积极参加文化大革命，当革命的闯将，而且把在斗争中焕发出来的革命干劲，用到生产上去。去年秋收以后，我们大寨人就进行了紧张的农田基本建设。我们不畏严寒，不怕艰苦，人人上阵，天天出工，经过一冬奋战，把去年夏季被洪水冲毁的七条大沟里的土地，全部修好，垒起崭新的石堰，加厚了土层。同时，还治理了一条乱石沟，新建了十二条石坝，扩大了耕地面积。我们还积了大量肥料，做了其他备耕工作。这个冬季的劳动成果比以往任何一年都多、都好。这就为夺取今年农业大丰收，创造了可靠的条件。
    眼下春耕大忙已经开始。春耕生产是关系到全年农业生产的收成，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，关系到巩固无产阶级专政的头等大事。实在是太重要了。这不仅是一项生产任务，更是一项重大的政治任务。要不要搞好生产，这是一场阶级斗争，一场两条路线的斗争。毛主席和党中央在这紧要关头，给我们贫下中农和农村干部的信，是对我们的最大关心和最高指示。我们贫下中农和革命干部最听毛主席的话，对毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，热烈响应，坚决拥护。昔阳县的无产阶级革命派和各级革命干部，在我们大寨召开了“抓革命，促生产”掀起春耕生产高潮的誓师大会。这对我们大寨是一个极大的鼓舞和鞭策，对昔阳县的革命和生产是一个极大的推动。
    我们大寨人正拿出更大的革命干劲，争取做出新的成绩，来回答毛主席和党中央对我们的关怀和全国人民对我们的鼓励。我们动员一切可以动员的力量，积极投入到春耕生产中去。一个热气腾腾、扎扎实实的春耕生产高潮正在我们大寨出现。在改造自然方面，今年，我们又有了新的措施，把七里以外的一个水库的水，引进大寨，引上山坡，把靠天下雨的四百亩旱地，变为不靠天的水浇地，由过去一年只能种一季变为一年种两季庄稼。人民解放军不仅积极支持我们闹革命，而且积极支援我们搞生产建设。在引水上山的工程中，他们给了我们极大的帮助。
    我们大寨正在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命洪流推动下，向前迈进。我们知道，在前进的路上，还会有这样那样的困难，还会有阶级敌人的反扑和自然灾害的侵袭。但是，有伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们什么都不怕，什么困难都能克服。大寨永远在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下前进！
