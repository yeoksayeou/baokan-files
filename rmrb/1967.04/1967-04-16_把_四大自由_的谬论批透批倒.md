I heard from the radio about the crimes of the top capitalist-roader in the party exposed in the article "Patriotism or Treason?" by Comrade Peng Zhenyu. It made me furious! He is afraid that landlords and rich peasants won't be "free," advocating for them to have "four freedoms": freedom to hire labor, freedom to lend money at high interest, freedom to buy and sell land, and freedom to operate businesses. In short, he wants to give them the freedom to counterattack and reverse the verdict, the freedom to exploit poor and lower-middle peasants, and the freedom to restore capitalism. He doesn't impose dictatorship on them but lets them cause trouble and stage a comeback. We firmly oppose this! Our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, teaches us that we must impose dictatorship on the enemy. Yet, the top capitalist-roader in the party gives the enemy all sorts of freedoms, treats the enemy with special care and courtesy. This is something the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow! As the saying goes, "What kind of vine produces what kind of gourd, what kind of melon produces what kind of bottle." Just from the nonsense spouted by the top capitalist-roader in the party, we can see that he is sitting on the landlords' and rich peasants' chairs, standing on the bourgeoisie's side, hating the poor and lower-middle peasants' liberation, and loving the landlords' and rich peasants' counterattack and reversal of the verdict. He is like leftover braised pork in June, red on the outside but smelly on the inside. He speaks sweetly but harbors a knife, and this knife is aimed at us poor and lower-middle peasants.

When it comes to the "four freedoms," it reminds me of the bitterness of bitter melon and class hatred from the old society. In the old society, power was in the hands of landlords and rich peasants, and the "three big mountains" weighed heavily on our heads. We poor and lower-middle peasants had no freedom at all. Take my family as an example. My grandfather worked as a hired laborer, and my father also worked for landlords, tilling their fields and doing odd jobs. As a hired laborer, from the rooster's crow to the dog's bark, he worked all year round without rest, eating gruel and thin soup. Hoping for a better year, year after year, wearing a patched quilted jacket. Helping landlords till their fields, bowing down in sweat, lifting up sweat still dripping, from sowing to harvesting, only getting two bushels of rice for an acre of land, how could we eat our fill and keep warm? The exploitation of landlords and rich peasants made us poor and lower-middle peasants sell our houses and land, sell our sons and daughters.

Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, through the heroic struggles of countless revolutionary forerunners, we overthrew the "three big mountains," and we poor and lower-middle peasants stood up and took power, gaining freedom. Take me, for example. In the old society, I had no freedom to speak or walk. After liberation, my political status went from the ground to the sky. Last year, I even went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations and saw our dearest leader Chairman Mao. In the old society, landlords and rich peasants trampled us poor and lower-middle peasants into the gates of hell; in the new society, Chairman Mao invited us to Tiananmen. But the top capitalist-roader in the party sees our poor and lower-middle peasants' liberation and is not happy at all, seeing landlords and rich peasants lose their "freedom" as painful as cutting flesh. He shouts loudly to restore the "four freedoms" of landlords and rich peasants, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will not agree to this a thousand times, ten thousand times. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, manage the people's commune collective economy well, hold the reins tightly, grasp the gun firmly, and impose dictatorship on the class enemy.

The "four freedoms" advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the party is to undermine the foundations of socialism, restore capitalism, make us take the wrong path, and suffer twice. We poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not fall for his tricks. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Chairman Mao is our closest relative, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and act the most resolutely according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The top capitalist-roader in the party wants us not to listen to Chairman Mao's words but to listen to his words and fall for his tricks, which is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, ten thousand times impossible! We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely read Chairman Mao's books every day, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, and follow Chairman Mao forever. Reading Chairman Mao's books makes us understand more revolutionary truths; listening to Chairman Mao's words makes the revolution thorough; closely following Chairman Mao makes the path wider and wider, leading straight to communism. The top capitalist-roader in the party is the relative of landlords and rich peasants and the enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The bridge is the bridge, and the road is the road. There is either me or him, not both. We must definitely hold high the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought and wield the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to stink the top capitalist-roader in the party.

    把“四大自由”的谬论批透批倒
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社印南大队
    学习毛主席著作积极分子  曹云亚
    我从广播里听到了戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇文章里揭发的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪状，把我气坏了！他生怕地主、富农不“自由”，提倡给地主、富农“四大自由”，让他们雇工自由、放高利贷自由、土地买卖自由、经营自由。一句话，就是给他们反攻倒算的自由，给他们剥削贫下中农的自由，给他们恢复资本主义的自由。对他们不实行专政，还让他们翻天，让他们搞复辟，我们坚决不答应！我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：对敌人要实行专政。而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，却给敌人这样那样的自由，对敌人特别关心，特别客气。这是广大贫下中农决不允许的。啥咯藤结啥咯瓜，啥咯葫芦画啥咯瓢。光从党内头号走资本主义道路当权派讲的这种鬼话里，就能看出他的屁股是坐在地主、富农的板凳上，他的脚跟是站在资产阶级的立场上，恨的是贫下中农的翻身，爱的是地主、富农反攻倒算。他好象六月里的隔夜红烧肉，看看红彤彤，闻闻臭烘烘。他嘴里讲出糖来，心里拔出刀来，这把刀就是对准我们贫下中农的。
    提起“四大自由”，就使我想起了旧社会的黄连苦和阶级仇。在旧社会，政权捏在地主、富农的手里，“三座大山”压在我们贫下中农头上，我们贫下中农一点自由也没有。拿我家来说，我的老公公当长工，爸爸也帮地主包田包地做短工。当长工，从鸡叫做到狗叫，一年到头不歇，吃的是粥汤稀水。今年望着来年好，年年穿件破棉袄。帮地主种包田，低头一把汗，抬头汗不干，从种到收，一亩地只给二斗米工钱，又哪能吃饱穿暖？地主、富农的剥削，害得我们贫下中农卖房卖地，卖儿卖女。
    在伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，经过无数革命先辈的英勇斗争，推翻了“三座大山”，我们贫下中农翻了身，掌了权，有了自由。拿我来说，在旧社会说话、走路都没有自由，解放后政治地位由地上翻到天上，去年，还到北京参加了国庆观礼，见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。旧社会，地主、富农把我们贫下中农踩进地狱门；新社会，毛主席把我们请到天安门。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派看到我们贫下中农翻身满肚皮不高兴，看到地主、富农失掉“自由”比割肉还痛。他大喊大叫要恢复地主、富农的“四大自由”，我们贫下中农一千个、一万个不答应。我们坚决听毛主席的话，办好人民公社集体经济，捏紧印把子，握紧枪杆子，对阶级敌人实行专政。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提倡的“四大自由”，就是要挖社会主义墙脚，复辟资本主义，要我们走回头路，吃二遍苦。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，决不上他的当。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”毛主席是我们最亲最亲的亲人，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最坚决地照毛主席的指示办事。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，要想叫我们不听毛主席的话，听他的话，上他的当，那是一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们贫下中农一定要天天读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话，永生永世跟毛主席走。读了毛主席的书，革命道理懂得多；听了毛主席的话，革命才能革到底；紧紧跟着毛主席走，路越走越宽，一直走向共产主义。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是地主、富农的亲人，是我们贫下中农的仇人。桥归桥，路归路，有我无他，有他无我。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的照妖镜，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
