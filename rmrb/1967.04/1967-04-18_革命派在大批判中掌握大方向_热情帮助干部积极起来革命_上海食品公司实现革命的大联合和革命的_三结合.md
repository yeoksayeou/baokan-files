The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Shanghai Food Company have steadfastly implemented the revolutionary line of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticizing the reactionary line of the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, who proposed "striking down a large number and protecting a small clique." The masses helped the cadres during the criticism, and the cadres stood up to join the revolution, achieving unity among the proletarian revolutionary factions and promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

It is necessary to settle accounts with the evil influence of "striking down a large number and protecting a small clique"

The proletarian cultural revolution in this company began after the "Four Cleanups" campaign had basically ended. In the latter part of the "Four Cleanups" campaign, the revolutionary masses had evaluated the cadre team, and the majority of the cadres were deemed good or relatively good. However, the work team, following the instructions of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, kicked aside the achievements of the "Four Cleanups" and put forward reactionary slogans such as "old problems with new understanding, new and old problems all together," and "demons and ghosts all together." They prepared public opinion to execute the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, "striking down a large number and protecting a small clique."

The executors of the bourgeois reactionary line indiscriminately attacked the cadres, without distinguishing between right and wrong, and without class analysis, generally rejecting and overthrowing them. They instructed the masses to write big-character posters to attack the cadres and demanded that they "raise the level" and "raise the line." For some cadres with minor issues, the masses could not write substantial big-character posters, so they threw out historical dossier materials, even fabricating facts and providing false materials. They also ordered over a hundred cadres at the level of section chief and above to "step aside." Out of the 83 leading cadres at the section level and above in the entire company, 42 were persecuted. The meat processing department had five section chiefs, three of whom were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," and two were made to "step aside." Out of nine deputy section chiefs, seven were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries."

To achieve the goal of "striking down a large number and protecting a small clique," the executors of the bourgeois reactionary line also adopted the method of "striking down a large number" against the masses. They proposed to "sweep horizontally and vertically, rummage through boxes and drawers," to root out big and small "three families and two shops," to "dig out black gangs and black lines," and to incite the masses to fight the masses. In the early stages of the movement, some departments had over 80% of the masses named in big-character posters. The masses saw that they were shifting the direction of the struggle and were very indignant, voicing opinions and posting big-character posters. They then directed the spearhead at the masses, saying that "opposing the work team is opposing the Party," and organized attacks. Even more vile was their instigation of cadres to persecute the masses. To root out the so-called "three families and two shops" in the finance department, they not only forced the finance department chief to post big-character posters against three revolutionary masses but also dispatched four section chiefs from other departments to "support" them. During this period, many revolutionary masses were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Conversely, they cherished and protected the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, allowing some to join the work team and participate in the core leadership. When the masses posted big-character posters exposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of a small clique of bad elements, they threatened, saying, "You can post a thousand big-character posters, but he will still be a good cadre."

At that time, a large number of masses were persecuted, and a large number of cadres were made to "step aside." Many comrades were labeled with various political "hats." The revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm of the broad masses were severely suppressed, and their revolutionary vigor was severely struck down. Although the work team had withdrawn, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the company still stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line.

In the criticism, unite the majority of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions deeply felt that to thoroughly isolate the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and fight them down, it was necessary to achieve great unity. To achieve great unity, it was necessary to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and, in the criticism, unite the majority of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. The proletarian revolutionary factions held many large and small meetings, discussion meetings, and liaison meetings, mobilizing cadres and masses to expose, accuse, and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and further distinguishing themselves from the capitalist-roaders in the process of criticism.

The intense struggle first focused on whether revolutionary leading cadres could come out to join the revolution. In the early stages of the movement, after the proletarian revolutionary factions rose up to rebel, the original Party Committee Secretary Wang Kun proactively stood up and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary factions. Later, he criticized the bourgeois reactionary line with the masses. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party feared that revolutionary leading cadres would unite with revolutionary masses, so they spread rumors and shot arrows in the dark, saying that Wang Kun was a revisionist counter-revolutionary, and instructed some people who did not understand the truth to harass Wang Kun. The proletarian revolutionary factions, through serious investigation and research and class analysis, believed that Wang Kun, who came from a poor peasant family, had always worked diligently, connected with the masses, and was recognized as a good cadre during the "Four Cleanups" movement. Although he had some shortcomings and mistakes, he was still a revolutionary cadre. Therefore, regardless of what others said about being a "royalist" or having a "background," they firmly united and fought with Wang Kun, smashing the plot of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

There were also some cadres who had been deceived in the past, executed the bourgeois reactionary line, or made various mistakes and had many concerns at that time and dared not rise up to rebel. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party took advantage of their weaknesses, spreading the fallacies of "beware of political thieves" and "someone wants to come out to pick the fruit," scheming to prevent them from joining the revolution. The proletarian revolutionary factions counterattacked by propagating Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." To help cadres who made mistakes quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionary factions seriously criticized their shortcomings and mistakes, allowing them to undergo examination and testing in the masses' struggle; at the same time, they actively provided conditions to support them in various meetings to fight against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to "appear" in the struggle. The proletarian revolutionary factions of this company also followed Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasping ideological education as the central link to unite the entire Party in a great political struggle," targeting the various concerns of the cadres, with deep class feelings, conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, educating them to turn over from their stance and viewpoint, from their ideological feelings, to jump out of the "self" and truly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary factions, truly put down their burdens, and join the revolution. For a few cadres who were deeply poisoned and whose mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line were relatively serious, the proletarian revolutionary factions still strictly distinguished them from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In addition to allowing them to undergo examination and criticism in the revolutionary flames of the mass movement, to deeply touch their souls, they also focused on ideological work, seriously, actively, and enthusiastically providing enlightenment and help. When these cadres sincerely recognized their mistakes and were willing to correct them, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses also welcomed them. The political department of the company's Party Committee had a section chief who, in the early stages of the cultural revolution, executed the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes of suppressing the masses and suppressing the revolution. After a period of time since the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line began, her stance had not changed. The proletarian revolutionary factions believed that she had begged for food since she was young and had suffered a lot of class oppression in the old society, and her performance had been relatively good in her past work and the "Four Cleanups" movement. Therefore, they did not adopt the method of kicking her away and beating her to death, but patiently conducted class education for her, arousing her class feelings. Through repeated help and practical struggle tests, she gradually changed, turned against the enemy, and exposed many crimes and the evil plots of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party to incite the masses to fight the cadres, to incite the cadres to persecute the masses, and to attempt to kill two birds with one stone. Her revolutionary actions were supported and trusted by the masses.

Criticism promotes revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination

In the issue of uniting the majority of the masses, the proletarian revolutionary factions of the Shanghai Food Company also faced a complex situation. At the beginning, the company had 48 revolutionary mass organizations, and there were also some conservative organizations. Due to the deep poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line in the previous stage, there were some estrangements and certain differences in understanding among these organizations. At the same time, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party was also active in the dark, promoting some and suppressing others, stirring up disputes, creating chaos, and attempting to muddy the waters to protect themselves. The proletarian revolutionary factions insisted on the direction of the struggle, resolutely acted according to the Sixteen Points, resolutely believed in the masses, and relied on the masses. Various revolutionary mass organizations, through mutual liaison, formed the preparatory committee for criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in the company system. These organizations, through joint struggle, further deepened their understanding of each other, increased revolutionary friendship, united as one, and directed their spearheads at the capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the company. The deeper the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, the more the faces of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party were exposed, the more vigorous the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and the tighter the unity. The 48 revolutionary mass organizations gradually formed a unified revolutionary organization, achieving revolutionary unity from the bottom up, by department, by unit, and by system.

Criticism promoted unity, and on the basis of unity, it promoted the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Now, most of the 83 cadres at the section level and above in the entire company have risen up to join the revolution, and nine cadres at the section level and above have been elected as members of the company's revolutionary committee. Among the 14 grassroots units under the company, some cadres have also participated in the work of the revolutionary mass organizations and the core leadership, and together with the masses, they have taken up the dual burdens of revolution and production, and the work and production have taken on a new look.

    革命派在大批判中掌握大方向
    热情帮助干部积极起来革命
    上海食品公司实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    本报讯　上海食品公司的无产阶级革命派，坚定不移地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。群众在批判中帮助干部，干部在批判中起来革命，实现了无产阶级革命派大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”。
    必须清算“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的恶劣影响
    这个公司的无产阶级文化大革命，是在“四清”运动基本结束的时候开始的。“四清”运动后期，革命群众曾经对干部班子作了估价，绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的。可是，工作队却按照旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的“指示”，一脚踢开“四清”成果，提出“老问题新认识，新老问题一起算”，“阎王小鬼一起抓”等反动口号，为他们执行资产阶级反动路线“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，进行舆论准备。
    资产阶级反动路线的执行者，对干部不分青红皂白，不作阶级分析，一概排斥，一概打倒。他们布置群众写大字报对干部进行围攻，还要上“纲”上“线”。有的干部问题不大，群众写不出有“份量”的大字报，他们就抛出历史档案材料，甚至无中生有，捏造事实，提供假材料。他们还命令科长、支部书记以上的一百多名干部全部“靠边站”。全公司八十三个科级以上的领导干部中，被斗的就有四十二人。熟肉经营部有五个科长，三个被打成“反革命”，两个“靠边站”，九个股长中，七个被打成“反革命”。
    资产阶级反动路线的执行者要达到“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的目的，对群众同样采取了“打击一大片”的做法。他们提出要“横扫竖扫，翻箱倒柜”，要抓大大小小的“三家村”、“两家店”，要“挖黑帮，穿黑线”，挑动群众斗群众。运动初期，有的部门被大字报点名的群众，竟达百分之八十以上。群众看到他们转移斗争大方向，非常气愤，提意见、贴大字报。他们就把矛头指向群众，说什么“反对工作队，就是反党”，组织围攻。更加恶劣的是指使干部整群众。为了挖出财会科的所谓“三家村”，不仅硬逼财会科的科长贴三个革命群众的大字报，还派了别的部门的四个科长前往“支援”。这一时期，不少革命群众被打成“反革命”。相反的，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们却爱护备至，保护过关，有的还被拉进工作队参与核心领导。群众写大字报，揭露一小撮坏人的反党反社会主义罪行，他们就威胁说：“你贴一千张大字报，他照样是个好干部。”
    当时，一大批群众挨了斗，一大批干部靠了“边”。不少同志被戴上了各种各样的政治性“帽子”。广大群众的革命精神受到严重压抑，革命干劲受到严重打击。工作队虽然撤走了，但是公司内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，仍然顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线。
    在大批判中团结大多数革命群众和革命干部
    无产阶级革命派在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，深深感到：要彻底孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们斗垮斗臭，必须实现大联合，而要实现大联合，就必须彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在大批判中团结大多数革命群众和大多数革命干部。无产阶级革命派召开了多次大会、小会、座谈会、串连会，发动干部和群众揭发、控诉和批判资产阶级反动路线，在批判过程中进一步和走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限。
    激烈的斗争首先集中在允许不允许革命的领导干部出来革命。运动初期，无产阶级革命派起来造反以后，公司原党委书记王坤主动站出来，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，后来又和群众一起批判资产阶级反动路线。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派害怕革命领导干部同革命群众结合，就刮阴风，放暗箭，说王坤是反革命修正主义分子，指使一些不明真相的人揪住王坤不放。无产阶级革命派通过认真的调查研究，进行阶级分析，认为贫农出身的王坤同志，工作一贯勤勤恳恳，联系群众，是“四清”运动中被公认的好干部。虽然他有某些缺点错误，仍然是革命干部。于是不管别人说什么“保皇派”、“有背景”等等，他们坚决和王坤同志团结在一起，战斗在一起，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋。
    还有一些过去受了蒙蔽、执行过资产阶级反动路线或犯有这样那样错误的干部，当时顾虑较多，不敢起来造反。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派便利用他们这些弱点，散播“谨防政治扒手”、“有人想站出来摘桃子”等论调，阴谋阻止他们起来革命。无产阶级革命派针锋相对地宣传毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的干部政策。为了帮助犯错误的干部迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来，无产阶级革命派对他们的缺点、错误进行了严肃的批判，让他们在群众斗争中经受审查和考验；同时积极提供条件，支持他们在各种会议上同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争和批判资产阶级反动路线，在斗争中“亮相”。这个公司的无产阶级革命派还遵循毛主席的“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，针对干部的种种顾虑，怀着深厚的阶级感情，对他们进行了深入细致的思想政治工作，教育他们从立场观点上、从思想感情上转过来，从“私”字中跳出来，真正站到无产阶级革命派一边，真正放下包袱，起来革命。对少数受毒较深、执行资产阶级反动路线的错误比较严重的干部，无产阶级革命派仍然把他们与党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派严格区别开来。除了让他们在群众运动的革命烈火中接受审查、批判，狠触灵魂，还重点进行思想工作，严肃、积极、热情地给以启发帮助。当这些干部心悦诚服地认识错误，愿意改正错误的时候，无产阶级革命派和革命群众同样表示欢迎。公司党委政治处有一个科长，在文化大革命初期执行资产阶级反动路线，犯了镇压群众、压制革命的错误。批判资产阶级反动路线开始以后的一段时间里，她的立场依然没有改变。无产阶级革命派认为她从小讨饭，在旧社会吃过不少阶级压迫的苦，在以往的工作和“四清”运动中表现也比较好。因此，对她不是采取一脚踢开，一棍子打死的方法，而是耐心地对她进行阶级教育，激发她的阶级感情。通过一次再次的帮助和实践斗争的考验，她逐步转变过来，反戈一击，揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的许多罪行和挑动群众斗干部，挑动干部整群众，企图一箭双雕的罪恶阴谋。她的革命行动得到了群众的支持和信任。
    大批判促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    在团结群众大多数的问题上，上海食品公司的无产阶级革命派同样面临一个复杂的局面。一开始公司里就出现了四十八个革命群众组织，还有一些保守组织。由于前一阶段资产阶级反动路线的流毒很深，这些组织之间存在着一些隔阂和某些认识上的分歧。同时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又在暗里活动，捧一批，压一批，挑起纠纷，制造混乱，企图把水搅混，保护自己过关。无产阶级革命派坚持斗争大方向，坚决按照十六条办事，坚决相信群众，依靠群众。各革命群众组织经过相互串连，组成了公司系统的批判资产阶级反动路线的筹备委员会。这些组织在共同的斗争中，彼此进一步加强了解，增进革命友谊，团结一致，把矛头对准党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和公司内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。对资产阶级反动路线批判越深，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的面目越暴露，群众革命精神越旺盛，团结越紧密，四十八个革命群众组织逐步组成了一个统一的革命组织，实现了自下而上的按部门、按单位、按系统的革命的大联合。
    大批判促进了大联合，又在大联合的基础上，促进了革命的“三结合”。现在，全公司八十三个科级以上的领导干部大部分起来革命了，有九名科级以上领导干部被选为公司革命委员会的成员。公司所属的十四个基层单位，一部分干部也参加了革命群众组织和领导核心工作，和群众一起挑起革命生产两副担子，工作和生产气象一新。
