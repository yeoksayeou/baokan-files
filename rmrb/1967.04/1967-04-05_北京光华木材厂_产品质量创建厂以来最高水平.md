Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory's proletarian revolutionary faction, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, has greatly enhanced their sense of responsibility as masters of the enterprise. In the first quarter of this year, they completed the state plan ten days ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. The quality of their main products has significantly surpassed the state's specified standards, achieving the highest level since the factory's establishment.

Guanghua Timber Factory is one of the largest timber factories in the country. In mid-January of this year, after the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they immediately launched a campaign of "grasp revolution, promote production." Revolutionary workers actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, conducting production with seriousness and meticulousness, striving for high-quality products. Workers in the sawing workshop, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties, not fearing sacrifice, and striving for victory," overcame numerous challenges and created a new method of sawing wood. This method not only saves a large amount of wood and reduces the number of processes but also improves quality. According to statistics from the factory's relevant departments, the product quality of all eight workshops has steadily improved since the seizure of power. The first and second-grade product rate of the plywood workshop was 62% in January and surged to over 90% in February, setting a new record for the entire factory.

    北京光华木材厂
    产品质量创建厂以来最高水平
    北京光华木材厂的无产阶级革命派，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权后，主人翁的责任感大大提高，今年第一季度提前十一天超额完成了国家计划；主要产品的质量大大超过国家规定的指标，创造了建厂以来的最高水平。
    光华木材厂是全国大型木材厂之一。今年一月中旬，这个厂的无产阶级革命派夺权后，立即掀起了“抓革命，促生产”的高潮。革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，生产中严肃认真，一丝不苟，力求产品高质量。制材车间的革命工人，按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，克服重重困难，创造了一种新的木材下锯法，既节约了大量木材、减少工序，又提高了质量。据工厂有关部门统计，全厂八个车间的产品质量，夺权以后都稳步上升。胶合板车间的一、二级品率，一月份为百分之六十二，二月份就猛增到百分之九十以上，创造了全厂从未有过的新纪录。
