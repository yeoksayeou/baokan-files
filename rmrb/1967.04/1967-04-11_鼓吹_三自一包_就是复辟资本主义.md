In times of temporary economic difficulties in our country, the top capitalist-roader in the Party has been vigorously advocating "Three Freedoms and One Contract," fully exposing his ugly face of conspiring to restore capitalism.

Who is most opposed to "Three Freedoms and One Contract," and who is most in favor of it? I have personal experience.

At that time, our production brigade was swept by a wave of individual farming. A few landlord and rich peasant elements said things like, "The bigger the collective, the worse; the smaller, the better; individual farming is the best." They said, "Contracting labor and production is legal," "Free buying and selling is legal." They fanned the flames of individual farming, attempting to sabotage the collective economy and restore capitalism.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately saw through their tricks and held struggle meetings to criticize them. At that time, we directed our hatred towards the landlord and rich peasant elements and did not realize that behind them was a big boss backing them up.

Only now do I understand that the top capitalist-roader in the Party is the mastermind behind the advocacy of the revisionist slogan "Three Freedoms and One Contract"; he is the one who advocates the "four freedoms"; he is the one who advocates the development of "peasants with three horses, one plow, and one cart"; he is the one who shamelessly says, "The laboring people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it," "China does not have too much capitalism, but too little capitalism." This philosophy of "man eating man" that he peddles is all for the restoration of capitalism.

I will never forget that in the old society, my family fled to Shanxi, sold my uncle, and starved my grandmother to death. I will also never forget that it was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that brought us happiness and showed us the light.

However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party is attempting to restore capitalism in our country, making us fall back into the abyss of misery. We will never agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways. We will use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to thoroughly fight him politically and ideologically.

Finally, I want to raise my fist and shout: Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand long lives to our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao!

    鼓吹“三自一包”就是复辟资本主义
    北京卫戍区某部一连　胡志奇
    在我国遇到暂时经济困难的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，极力鼓吹“三自一包”，彻底暴露了他阴谋复辟资本主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    谁最反对“三自一包”，谁最拥护“三自一包”，我有亲身的感受。
    那时候，我们生产队刮起了一股单干风。几个地主富农分子说什么生产队“大不如小，小不如个体好。”“包工包产合法了”，“自由买卖合法了”。他们大煽单干风，企图破坏集体经济，实现资本主义复辟。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，立即识破了他们的阴谋，召开了斗争大会，批判了他们。那时候我们把仇恨集中在地富分子身上，没有想到他们背后还有为他们撑腰的大老板。
    至今我才明白，鼓吹“三自一包”修正主义滥调的总后台老板，就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派；提倡“四大自由”的也是他，主张大力发展“三马一犁一车式的农民”也是他，胡说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了。”等无耻谰言的还是他。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，梦寐以求的是资本主义，他所歌功颂德的也是资本主义。他所贩卖的这一套人吃人的哲学，就是为了复辟资本主义。
    我永远不会忘记，在旧社会，我家逃荒到山西，卖掉叔父，饿死祖母的悲惨遭遇。我也决不会忘记，是毛主席和共产党给我们带来了幸福，使我们见到了光明。
    可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却企图在我国复辟资本主义，让我们重新陷入苦难的深渊。我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。我们要用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，从政治上、思想上彻底地把他斗倒斗臭。
    最后我要振臂高呼：以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
