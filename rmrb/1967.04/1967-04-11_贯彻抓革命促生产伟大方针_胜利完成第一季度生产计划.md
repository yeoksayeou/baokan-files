The workers of the Liaoning Steel Plant (formerly Shenyang Steel Plant) have resolutely implemented and executed Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Since the beginning of this year, they have completed the national plan every month, and the first quarter plan has been completed ahead of schedule by nine days. The steel output of this plant has increased by 84.4 percent compared to the same period last year, and the steel qualification rate has also improved.

After the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" was delivered to this plant, all revolutionary workers were filled with joy and enthusiasm. The revolutionary workers of the entire plant have expressed their determination to unite more closely under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong and with the help of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to do a better job of revolution and production, and to excellently complete the national production plan for the entire year.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Transformer Factory has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and has completed the national production plan for the first quarter of this year ahead of schedule by five days. The total output value of this factory has increased by 21.1 percent compared to the same period last year, and the product output has increased by 82.2 percent compared to the same period last year.

Before the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party on January 18, the production tasks in the factory were not completed well. After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction, with revolution guiding production, focused on the ideological revolution of the people, and placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the forefront of all work. The production enthusiasm of the workers has been continuously improved. Under the joint efforts of the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, the production situation has become better and better. In the process of completing the first quarter national plan, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory have also done their best to save raw materials and reduce production costs. The electrical group has carried out the spirit of self-reliance, built a substation by themselves, and saved the state four or five hundred thousand yuan.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Changzhi Steel Plant in Shanxi Province took power, they focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production, completing the total output value plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule by four days. The pig iron produced by this plant completed the first quarter plan ahead of schedule by ten days, exceeding it by 5.7 percent, and increased by 15.17 percent compared to the same period last year. The converter steel exceeded the plan by 3.7 percent and was completed ahead of schedule by three days, increasing by 4.71 percent compared to the same period last year.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in late January, they continued to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the forefront of all work, focused on the ideological revolution of the workers, and further mobilized everyone's production enthusiasm. In the first quarter, this plant not only quickly established a new order of revolution and production but also implemented fourteen major technological innovation projects. Among them, the revolutionary leaders, workers, and technicians of the coking plant implemented the "three-in-one" combination, designed and successfully manufactured a flotation machine by themselves, which can recover fine coal from coal slurry by more than 12,000 tons per year, saving the state 400,000 yuan.

    辽宁钢厂（原沈阳市钢铁厂）的革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，今年以来月月完成国家计划，第一季度计划已提前九天超额完成。这个厂的钢产量比去年同期增加百分之八十四点四，钢的合格率也有提高。
    《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》传到这个厂以后，广大革命职工无不欢欣鼓舞。全厂的革命职工纷纷表示，一定要在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，在人民解放军指战员的帮助下，更加紧密地团结起来，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，把革命和生产搞得好上加好，出色地完成今年全年的国家生产计划。太原变压器厂
    太原变压器厂的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，提前五天全面超额完成了今年第一季度国家生产计划。这个厂的总产值比去年同期增长百分之二十一点一，产品产量比去年同期增长百分之八十二点二。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派在一月十八日向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权以前，厂里生产任务完成得很不好。夺权后，无产阶级革命派以革命统帅生产，狠抓人的思想革命化，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，广大职工的生产积极性不断提高。在全厂革命职工的共同努力下，生产情况越来越好。在完成第一季度国家计划的过程中，全厂革命职工还千方百计地节约原料材料，降低了生产成本。电工组发扬自力更生的精神，自己建设成一座变电室，就为国家节约了四、五万元的资金。长治钢铁厂
    山西省长治钢铁厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前四天超额完成了第一季度的总产值计划。这个厂出产的生铁提前十天超额百分之五点七完成第一季度计划，比去年同期增长百分之十五点一七，转炉钢超额百分之三点七提前三天完成计划，比去年同期增长百分之四点七一。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派一月下旬夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权后，继续把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，狠抓广大职工的思想革命化，进一步调动了大家的生产积极性。第一季度，这个厂不仅迅速建立了革命和生产的新秩序，而且实现了十四个较大的技术革新项目。其中焦化车间革命的领导干部、工人和技术人员实行“三结合”，自己设计，自己制造成功了一部浮选机，每年可以从泥煤中回收精煤一万二千多吨，为国家节约达四十万元。
