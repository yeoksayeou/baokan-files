Shanghai Fisheries Bureau proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres unite to fight
Fiercely criticize the "strike a large area, protect a small clique" line

According to a report in the April 12 issue of Shanghai's *Wenhui Daily*, the proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Bureau recently held a "Highly Raise the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Thoroughly Criticize the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" meeting. They denounced the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line advocated by the number one capitalist-roadier in the Party in handling cadre issues.

On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee not only implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in cadre issues but also shifted the blame for promoting capitalism and revisionism entirely to the lower levels. They deliberately exaggerated and distorted the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Fisheries Bureau. They hastily dispatched work teams, drew frames, set the tone, and slandered the Fisheries Bureau as a "nest of revisionism." They viciously cursed over a hundred cadres in the bureau, threatening to "drive them all down to labor." In the four months following June of last year, these cadres suffered severe persecution under the bourgeois reactionary line of China's Khrushchev. At this time, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao led the entire Party and the people of the country to launch a comprehensive and fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary cadres of the Fisheries Bureau stood up one after another, and together with the revolutionary masses, rebelled.

Recently, after studying important articles such as "Patriotism or Treason?" "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line in Cadre Issues Must Be Criticized," and "'Strike a Large Area, Protect a Small Clique' Is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" from the *Red Flag* magazine, they immediately took action. They raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and launched a fierce attack on the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line.

They said, "Chairman Mao has long taught us: 'To lead a great revolution, we need a great party, and we need many of the best cadres.' Even when dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to implement the policy of 'punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient.' The bourgeois reactionary line, however, seeks to exclude and overthrow everything, which completely serves the needs of the domestic and foreign class enemies and plots to restore capitalism; it brazenly opposes Chairman Mao's cadre policy!

In the mass criticism struggle, the revolutionary faction, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres of the Fisheries Bureau listed many facts to point out that due to the pernicious influence of the bourgeois reactionary line not being thoroughly eliminated, the antagonistic sentiments between the masses and cadres, and between cadres themselves, have not yet been resolved. Especially for those cadres poisoned by *Self-Cultivation*, their spiritual "shackles" have not been completely shattered, seriously affecting the great alliance of revolution, the "three-in-one combination," the implementation of the directive to "grasp revolution and promote production," and cadres going to the masses. They are determined to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army," and unite all forces that can be united to thoroughly and deeply criticize the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. They plan to use forums, recollection and comparison, heart-to-heart talks, blackboard newspapers, and wall newspapers to deeply criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and criticize the big poisonous weed *Self-Cultivation*. They will place the revolutionary mass criticism at the forefront of all work, driving all work forward.

In this wave of mass criticism, the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mid-level cadres of the Fisheries Bureau all firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and took action with the revolutionary masses. Even the main responsible persons of the former work teams and sub-work teams, who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, also admitted their past mistakes in front of the masses and expressed their determination to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly overthrowing the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. Their revolutionary actions were warmly welcomed and firmly supported by the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses of the Fisheries Bureau.

    上海水产局无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部联合起来战斗
    狠批“打击一大片，保护一小撮”
    本报讯  据上海《文汇报》四月十二日报道：上海市水产局机关无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，日前举行“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线大会”，控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上提出“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。
    在文化大革命前夕，旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不仅在干部问题上推行了资产阶级反动路线，而且还把推行资本主义、修正主义黑货的罪责全部推给下面，故意夸大和歪曲水产局工作中的缺点和错误。他们急急忙忙派出工作队，划框框，定调子，污蔑水产局机关是“修正主义的黑窝”，大肆谩骂水产局机关里的一百多名干部，扬言要把他们“统统赶下去劳动”。在去年六月以后的四个月里，这些干部饱受了中国的赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的迫害。这时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席领导全党、全国人民向资产阶级反动路线展开了全面的猛烈回击。水产局机关的革命干部纷纷起来，同革命群众一道造反了。
    最近，他们学习了《红旗》杂志《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》、《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》等重要文章后，立即行动起来，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及资产阶级反动路线展开猛烈的攻击。
    他们说，毛主席早就教导我们：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。”就是对待犯错误的干部，毛主席也一再教导我们要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。而资产阶级反动路线却要排斥一切，打倒一切，这完全是适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，阴谋复辟资本主义；猖狂地同毛主席的干部政策相对抗！
    在群众性的大批判斗争中，水产局机关革命派、革命群众和革命干部还列举了许多事实指出，由于资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响还没有彻底肃清，目前群众与干部、干部与干部之间的对立情绪尚未消除。特别是受《修养》毒害的许多干部，精神上的“枷锁”还没有彻底粉碎，严重地影响了革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，影响“抓革命，促生产”指示的贯彻，影响干部到群众中去。他们决心进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，遵照毛主席的教导：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，把一切可以团结的力量联合起来，彻底批深批透党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。他们打算通过座谈会、回忆对比、交心会、黑板报及墙报等形式，深入批判资产阶级反动路线，批判《修养》这株大毒草，将革命的大批判放在一切工作的首位，以带动一切工作。
    在这次群众性的大批判高潮中，水产局的革命领导干部与革命的中层干部，都坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，与革命群众一道行动起来了。即使是原来执行过资产阶级反动路线的工作总团、工作分团的主要负责人，也都在群众面前承认了过去的错误，并表示要坚决地站到毛主席的革命路线上来，彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。他们的革命行动，受到了水产局机关无产阶级革命派、革命群众热烈欢迎和坚决的支持。
