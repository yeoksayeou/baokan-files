Just as the storm of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai swept across the nation, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat united, implemented the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and engaged in a decisive battle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At this critical moment, the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine published an editorial and an important article by Comrade Peng Zhen, "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?", sounding the new charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To catch the ringleader first and uproot the weeds, we must seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. To seize it thoroughly and cleanly, we must seize power from their biggest backer—the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road—and pull him down from his horse, making him step aside!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely great and profound ideological revolution. As Comrade Lin Biao said, "It is a total onslaught against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology." Over the past seventeen years, the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, as a missionary of revisionism, has pushed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the realms of politics, economy, culture, education, and science and technology. He has peddled a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, launching a full-scale, wanton attack on the proletariat. Now is the time for us to settle accounts with him! The fundamental point of Mao Zedong Thought is to criticize, to struggle, and to revolutionize. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the seven hundred million revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest critics. We must firmly hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, and thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie proposed by the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, as well as his counter-revolutionary revisionist theories such as "Self-Cultivation." Only in this way can we ensure the thorough victory of the struggle to seize power.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always shown great concern for the work of science and technology in our country and has set the course for the development of science and technology in our country. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the development of science and technology in our country. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and are entrenched in the State Science and Technology Commission have long opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, refused to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to drag our country's scientific and technological community onto the road of capitalist restoration. Why have these handful of bad elements dared to be so wanton? It is because they have the backing of the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road; and they are the peddlers of the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. In this cultural revolution, they have faithfully carried out and stubbornly adhered to the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie proposed by the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, encircling the revolutionary masses, suppressing the people, and implementing white terror, attempting to extinguish the flames of the cultural revolution in the State Science and Technology Commission. The proletarian revolutionary masses of our State Science and Technology Commission have, over the past eight to nine months, deeply felt in their life-and-death struggle with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road that to thoroughly overthrow, smash, and denounce these bad elements, we must thoroughly criticize and denounce their backer—the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road—and politically and ideologically overthrow him completely.

Chairman Mao said: "You must concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The most important state affair at present is to politically and ideologically thoroughly overthrow the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary scientific and technological workers on the science and technology front must take immediate action and join the seven hundred million people in the great struggle to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev! Firmly hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for the thorough victory of the struggle to seize power!

    彻底肃清《修养》的流毒
    国家科委革命委员会负责人　张本
    正当上海“一月革命”的风暴席卷全国，无产阶级革命派联合起来，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的决战时刻，《红旗》杂志第五期发表了评论员文章和戚本禹同志的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的新的进军号。
    擒贼先擒王，斩草必除根。我们夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，要夺得彻底，夺得干净，就必须夺他们最大的后台老板——党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的权，把他拉下马，让他靠边站！
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极其伟大、极其深刻的思想大革命，正如林彪同志所说的，“是对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想的总攻击。”十七年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，作为修正主义的传教士，在政治、经济、文化、教育、科学技术各个领域，推行资产阶级反动路线，贩卖一整套反革命修正主义黑货，同以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，与伟大的毛泽东思想相对抗，向无产阶级发动了全面的猖狂进攻。现在，是到了我们同他进行总清算的时候了！毛泽东思想的基本点，就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派和七亿革命人民，是最伟大的批评家。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，动员亿万革命群众，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，以及他的《修养》之类的反革命修正主义理论，批深、批透、批倒、批臭。只有这样，才能保证夺权斗争的彻底胜利。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，一向对我国科学技术工作给予了极大的关怀，规定了我国科学技术发展的道路。毛泽东思想是发展我国科学技术的指导方针。可是，盘踞在国家科委的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来，对抗毛主席的革命路线，拒不执行毛主席的指示，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，顽固推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图把我国科学技术界拉上资本主义复辟的道路。为什么这一小撮坏家伙竟敢如此猖狂呢？就是因为有党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在背后支持他们；而他们也就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑货推销员。在这次文化大革命运动中，他们又忠实执行和顽固坚持了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，镇压群众，实行白色恐怖，妄图扑灭国家科委的文化大革命烈火。我们国家科委的无产阶级革命派，从八、九个月来同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的生死搏斗中，深深感到，要把这一小撮坏家伙彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，就必须把他们的后台老板——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批透、批臭，从政治上、思想上把他彻底打倒。
    毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”当前，最大的国家大事，就是从政治上、思想上彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。科技战线的无产阶级革命派和革命的科学技术工作者，紧急行动起来，投入七亿人民批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的伟大斗争！高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，争取夺权斗争的彻底胜利！
