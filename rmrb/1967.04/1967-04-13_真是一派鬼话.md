It's All a Pack of Lies

On April 8, the leader of the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, Suharto, held his first press conference after seizing presidential power. He boasted about his regime's policy of "active independence," claiming it is not subordinate to any foreign ideology, is "anti-imperialist," and will contribute to maintaining "peace and social justice in the world order." What a pack of lies!

The Suharto regime has aligned itself with U.S. imperialism and colluded with Soviet revisionism, opening its doors wide to imperialism and allowing Soviet revisionist forces to infiltrate Indonesia. His so-called "active independence" is nothing but active betrayal of the nation.

The Suharto regime has imposed fascist terror within the country, carrying out large-scale massacres of communists and patriots, and brutally persecuting overseas Chinese. He claims to be "not subordinate to any foreign ideology," but in reality, he is subordinate to the ideologies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and is rabidly anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people.

The Suharto regime came to power with the support of imperialism and acts in accordance with the dictates of U.S. imperialism. His so-called "anti-imperialism" is nothing but servile obedience to U.S. imperialism.

The Suharto regime actively supports U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, eagerly forming military alliances, and serving the sinister plans of U.S. imperialism to establish an anti-China encirclement. His so-called contribution to maintaining the "world order" is nothing but acting as a pathetic lackey for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia.

Those who clearly betray their country for personal gain dare to talk about "independence." Those who are clearly running dogs of U.S. imperialism dare to sing about "anti-imperialism." How shameless!

The reason Suharto and his clique of fascist military men have to spout such insincere words is that their reputation is already too tarnished. They have to put on a facade to continue their rule. That's all there is to it!

When Suharto talks about his "anti-imperialist" tune, will he offend U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism? Of course not. U.S. imperialism has always wanted its running dogs to wear a human face, making it easier for them to do their dirty work. As for Soviet revisionism, it also wants its "friends" to put on more makeup, which seems to add some "luster" to itself. When Suharto was talking about "anti-imperialism," he couldn't help but exclaim, "Foreign aid is very much needed." In fact, even if he didn't say this, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism would still reward these reactionary elements.

    真是一派鬼话
    四月八日，印度尼西亚右派军人集团的头子苏哈托，在篡夺了总统权力后的第一次记者招待会上，大肆吹嘘他的政权奉行什么“积极独立”的、“不附属于任何外国意识形态”的、“反帝”的外交政策，并且要为“维护和平与社会正义的世界秩序作出贡献”。真是一派鬼话！
    苏哈托政权投靠美帝，勾结苏修，既向帝国主义大开门户，又让苏修势力伸进印尼。他的所谓“积极独立”，就是积极卖国。
    苏哈托政权在国内实行法西斯恐怖统治，大规模屠杀共产党人和爱国者，残酷地迫害华侨。他口称“不附属于任何外国意识形态”，实际上却是附属于美帝苏修的“意识形态”，疯狂地反共反华反人民。
    苏哈托政权依靠帝国主义的支持而上台，处处都按照美帝的意旨行事。他的所谓“反帝”，就是奴颜婢膝地事奉美帝。
    苏哈托政权竭力支持美帝国主义侵略越南的政策，积极拼凑军事集团，为美帝国主义建立反华包围圈的阴谋计划效劳。他的所谓为“维护”“世界秩序作出贡献”，就是充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的一名可怜的走卒。
    明明是卖国求荣的民族败类，却侈谈什么“独立”。明明是美帝国主义的走狗，却高唱什么“反帝”。真是不知羞耻！
    苏哈托之所以要说出这样一些言不由衷的门面话，就是因为他们这一小撮法西斯军人集团的名声实在搞得太臭了。他们不得不给自己粉饰一番，好继续混下去。如此而已，岂有他哉！
    苏哈托大谈其“反帝”的调子，是不是会得罪了美帝和苏修呢？当然不会。美帝国主义何尝不希望它的走狗能披上一张人皮，这样才更便于去干走狗的差事。至于苏修，它也愿意它的“朋友”在脸上多涂些粉墨，这对苏修自己说来似乎也有几分“光采”。苏哈托在大讲“反帝”时，情不自禁地叫道：“外援是非常需要的”。其实，他即使不说这句话，美帝和苏修也一定会照样犒赏这一小撮反动家伙的。
