In the Indonesian city of Cirebon, East Java, a severe bloodshed incident occurred on March 26, where the right-wing reactionary authorities forced the death of overseas Chinese and deployed military police to shoot at overseas Chinese. The local overseas Chinese, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fought against the fully armed reactionary military police. They set an example of daring to struggle and daring to win among the overseas Chinese, striking a blow to the arrogant attitude of the Indonesian reactionaries and exposing their brutal and weak nature.

The right-wing reactionary authorities in Cirebon, following the four anti-Chinese, anti-overseas Chinese "decisions" issued by the head of the Indonesian Eighth Military Region, Sumitro, arrested more than sixty overseas Chinese who were unable to pay the high "special obligation donations" from March 20 to 22. They were detained along with twenty-nine other overseas Chinese who had previously been arrested for refusing to hand over their shops. Fang Chunzhu, one of the detained overseas Chinese, was arrested and could not bear the torture and provocation, forcing her to jump into a well and commit suicide in the early hours of March 26. Other detained overseas Chinese discovered this and rushed to the well to rescue her. The Indonesian people outside the detention center also brought ropes to enter the center to save her, but were unreasonably refused by the guarding military police, resulting in Fang Chunzhu being drowned to death.

The news of Fang Chunzhu being persecuted to death by the Indonesian reactionaries shocked Cirebon. The overseas Chinese and Chinese youth living there immediately rushed to the detention center, quickly gathering hundreds of people. The right-wing authorities, in order to destroy the evidence, immediately dispatched armed personnel to attempt to seize Fang Chunzhu's body. The overseas Chinese on the scene saw through this plot, and more than two hundred people broke through the blockade and entered the center to guard the deceased's body, engaging in fierce struggles with the right-wing military police. At this time, three trucks of fully armed soldiers with bayonets charged towards the overseas Chinese and inhumanely opened fire with rifles and machine guns at the unarmed overseas Chinese, firing hundreds of rounds. However, the overseas Chinese and Chinese youth stood firm, holding hands to defend their position, refusing to retreat. The Chinese youth, amidst the piercing gunshots, calmly recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison. The struggle lasted for three hours, with three Chinese youth being injured by bullets, three others injured by bayonets and rifle butts, and many others beaten. They all persisted and did not leave the front line. Finally, the right-wing military police had to withdraw from the detention center, forced to abandon their plan to seize the body.

After the right-wing military police withdrew from the detention center, they immediately sealed off all routes leading to the detention center, deploying armed sentries throughout the city as if facing a major enemy, threatening the overseas Chinese. The several hundred overseas Chinese who remained in the detention center continued their struggle, presenting six serious demands to the right-wing authorities, including the immediate release of all detained overseas Chinese, holding a funeral and burial for Fang Chunzhu, and guaranteeing the safety of overseas Chinese. The struggle continued until late at night, with the right-wing authorities being forced to verbally agree to most of the demands. Subsequently, a solemn funeral was held for Fang Chunzhu's body in the detention center, and on March 27, the coffin was moved to the funeral parlor. The overseas Chinese who participated in the struggle then withdrew from the detention center.

Recently, the reactionary authorities in East Java have been madly implementing their anti-Chinese reactionary decrees, forcing the deaths of many overseas Chinese. During the funerals for these overseas Chinese who were forced to death, many overseas Chinese and Indonesian people, despite the right-wing military police's gunfire suppression, voluntarily joined the funeral procession. Some funeral processions stretched for several miles, forming a strong protest and demonstration against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary authorities.

The broad masses of Chinese youth in the East Java region pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries are responsible for the deaths of overseas Chinese. They stated that they would remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionaries are paper tigers," and turn their hatred into strength to resolutely fight against the brutal persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries.

    印尼东爪哇反动当局疯狂迫害华侨造成严重流血事件
    我侨胞英勇斗争  狠狠打击印尼反动派凶焰
    新华社一日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚东爪哇谏义里市，三月二十六日发生了印尼右派反动当局逼死华侨和出动军警枪击华侨的严重的流血事件。当地的华侨以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同全副武装的反动军警进行了坚决的斗争，在侨胞中树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样，打击了印尼反动派的嚣张气焰，暴露了它的残暴虚弱的本质。
    谏义里市的右派反动当局按照印尼第八军区头目苏米特洛发布的四项反华、排华“决定书”，在三月二十日到二十二日逮捕了无法缴纳高额的“特别义务捐”的华侨六十多人，同以前因拒绝交出他们经营的商店而被捕的华侨二十九人关押在一起。难侨方春竹被捕后因不堪虐待和刺激，被迫在三月二十六日凌晨投井自杀。拘留所内的其他难侨发现后，就赶到井边营救。拘留所外的印尼人民也携带绳索要进入所内救人，但遭到守卫的军警无理拒绝，以致方春竹被活活淹死。
    难侨方春竹被印尼反动派迫害而死的消息震动了谏义里市，居住在当地的华侨和华侨青少年立刻就涌向拘留所，很快就聚集了数百人。印尼右派当局为了消灭罪证，当即派出武装人员，妄想把难侨方春竹的遗体劫走。在场的华侨识破了这一阴谋，有二百多人冲破封锁进入所内，守护死者遗体，同右派军警展开了激烈的斗争。这时，三卡车的全副武装的陆军士兵上了刺刀向华侨进逼，并灭绝人性地向手无寸铁的华侨开动步枪和机关枪，发弹数百发。但是华侨和华侨青年们巍然不动，手挽手地坚守阵地，绝不退缩。华侨青少年们在凄厉的枪声中，神色自若地齐声朗读毛主席语录。斗争持续了三个小时，有三个华侨青年被枪弹打伤，另外有三个华侨青年被刺刀枪托所伤，还有许多人被殴打，他们都坚持不下火线。最后右派军警不得不撤出拘留所，被迫放弃了劫尸的计划。
    右派军警撤出拘留所以后，随即严密封锁了通往拘留所的一切通道，如临大敌地在全市布满武装岗哨，向华侨进行威胁。留在拘留所的几百名华侨坚持斗争，向右派当局提出了六项严正要求，其中包括立即释放全部被捕华侨，为难侨方春竹吊丧和安葬和保障华侨的安全。斗争一直坚持到深夜，右派当局被迫口头同意了大部分要求。接着在拘留所为方春竹遗体举行了隆重的入殓式，在三月二十七日把棺木移往殡仪馆，参加斗争的侨胞才退出了拘留所。
    最近，东爪哇反动当局疯狂推行其排华反动法令，已经逼死华侨多人。在为这些被逼死的华侨送葬时，许多华侨和印尼人民不顾右派军警开枪镇压，自动加入送葬行列，有的送葬行列长达数里，形成了对印尼反动当局法西斯暴行的强烈抗议和示威。
    东爪哇地区广大华侨青年指出，印尼反动派逼死华侨罪责难逃。他们表示，他们将牢记伟大领袖毛主席的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”这一教导，要把仇恨化为力量，同印尼反动派的残酷迫害进行坚决的斗争。
