	Xinhua News Agency, April 25th

	In the midst of the nationwide movement to criticize the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the revolutionary printers in the capital, after days and nights of struggle, have rushed to print a large batch of the horizontal format edition of Selected Works of Mao Zedong, delivering an invincible ideological weapon to the broad ranks of revolutionary cadres and fighters.

	When this batch of Selected Works of Mao Zedong began to be sold today at the Xinhua Bookstore in Xidan and Xinjiekou, long queues had already formed in front of the stores. The scene was festive, with drums and gongs resounding, and people enthusiastically cheered: This is the first major joyous event since the establishment of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee!

	A student from Beijing No. 31 Middle School, upon seeing the news of the distribution of Selected Works of Mao Zedong early this morning, was overjoyed and immediately ran back to call several classmates to join the queue to buy the precious book. An office worker, after purchasing the precious book, immediately called home to tell the family to come and share his happiness. He said: "Under the control of the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, that revisionist poisonous weed 'Self-Cultivation' was published again and again, but not our beloved leader Chairman Mao's precious book. We must thoroughly defeat those bad elements!" A 68-year-old neighborhood resident, after buying the book, said: "The top capitalist-roader in the Party used his 'Self-Cultivation' to poison countless young people. I will definitely teach my grandchildren to read Chairman Mao's books every day and never fall for the trick of 'Self-Cultivation'." A soldier of the People's Liberation Army said well: "We are infinitely reverent and believe in the great Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to thoroughly criticize the poisonous weed 'Self-Cultivation' of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over all of China and the world!"

	Many revolutionary cadres and fighters, after purchasing the book, all expressed their determination to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, holding high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly criticize and defeat the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Today, the revolutionary comrades of the Xinhua Bookstore who participated in the distribution of Selected Works of Mao Zedong were all jubilant. They excitedly said that in the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution, a group of capitalist-roaders in the Party have been exposed, and the revolutionary cadres have taken control of the right to distribute Chairman Mao's works, with the number of publications greatly increased. They all expressed their determination that in the current movement to criticize the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the Party, they will timely deliver the invincible ideological weapon to the hands of the revolutionary cadres and fighters, and use their actual actions to promote the current mass criticism movement.

    《毛泽东选集》横排本大量出版
    广大革命群众喜得最锐利的战斗武器
    革命群众决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派彻底批倒批臭
    新华社二十五日讯　在举国上下掀起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动中，首都革命的印刷工人经过日日夜夜的战斗，又赶印出一大批横排本《毛泽东选集》，为广大无产阶级革命派战士送来了战无不胜的思想武器。
    当这一批《毛泽东选集》今天开始由新华书店在新街口和西单两处同时发售时，书店门前老早就排起了长长的队伍。这里锣鼓喧天，一片节日气氛，人们热烈欢呼：这是北京市革命委员会成立以后的头一件大喜事！
    北京三十一中的一位同学，今天一大早看到发行《毛泽东选集》的喜报以后，高兴得不得了，马上跑回去叫了几个同学一道来排队买宝书。有一位机关干部买到宝书以后，立刻打电话告诉家里，让全家人都来分享他的幸福。他说：“过去在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，那本修正主义的大毒草《修养》出了又出，就是不出我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的宝书，我们一定要把那些坏家伙彻底打倒！”一位六十八岁的街道居民买到宝书以后说：“党内头号走资本主义道路当权派用他那本《修养》，不知道毒害了多少年青人，我一定教育我的孙子天天读毛主席的书，决不上那本《修养》的当。”一位人民解放军战士说得好：“我们就是对伟大的毛泽东思想无限崇拜，无限信仰。我们一定用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界！”
    许多无产阶级革命派买到了书后，都表示要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批倒批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    今天参加《毛泽东选集》发行工作的新华书店的革命同志，人人欢欣鼓舞。他们兴奋地说，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，革命派掌握了毛主席著作的发行大权，发行数量比过去大大增加。他们纷纷表示，在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的大批判中，我们一定要及时地把战无不胜的思想武器送到无产阶级革命派手中，用自己的实际行动来推动当前这场群众性的大批判运动。
