In the face of heavy blows from the Vietnamese people and military, the morale of U.S. troops in Vietnam has been plummeting, even leading to open refusals to fight.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on the morning of April 14, some U.S. soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division stationed in the O Long region of Tuyen Duc Province openly refused to carry out orders for a "sweeping" operation. The U.S. commanders were extremely frightened and immediately opened fire to suppress the rebellion. The soldiers who refused to fight also returned fire. The shooting lasted for about thirty minutes. As a result, fifty U.S. soldiers were killed, three helicopters were destroyed, and thirteen tents were set ablaze. The U.S. invasion commanders, fearing the situation would escalate, hastily ordered a three-day lockdown of the O Long base.

    美军官慌忙开枪镇压　拒战士兵也开火还击
    新华社河内二十三日电　在越南南方军民的沉重打击下，侵越美军的士气日益低落，甚至发展到公开拒战。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，四月十四日早晨驻扎在土龙木省油汀地区的美国第四步兵师的一些美军士兵，公开拒绝执行外出“扫荡”的命令。美军指挥官对此非常惊恐，连忙开枪镇压。拒战的士兵也开火还击。双方对打达三十分钟之久。结果，五十名美军被打死，三架直升飞机被击毁，十三座帐篷起火燃烧。美国侵略军的指挥官们生怕事情扩大，慌忙下令封锁油汀基地三天。
