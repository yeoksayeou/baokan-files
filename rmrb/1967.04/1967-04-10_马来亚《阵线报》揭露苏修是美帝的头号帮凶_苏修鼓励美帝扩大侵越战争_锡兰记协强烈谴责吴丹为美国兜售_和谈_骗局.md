	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on April 8, the Singapore-based Malaysian newspaper "Frontline News" recently published a commentary stating that the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionist leadership have encouraged Johnson to further expand his war of aggression.

	The commentary said that the recent Guam conference convened by the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, is a meeting to further expand the war of aggression, and no amount of "peace" talk can cover it up.

	The commentary pointed out that Johnson dared to launch new war adventures in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, which is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist leadership's relentless betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and their policy of forming a new "holy alliance" with the U.S. against China and communism.

	The commentary exposed that to realize this conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist leadership has spared no effort to promote the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception, running around and offering advice, colluding with U.S. imperialism from within and without, and putting pressure on the Vietnamese people. At the same time, they have incited an unprecedented wave of anti-China sentiment, launched various anti-China activities, and openly instigated a rift between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

	The commentary pointed out that while U.S. imperialism was carrying out mad bombing raids on North Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership was conspiring with the U.S. in Geneva to conduct so-called negotiations on the "Prevention of Nuclear Proliferation Treaty," and engaged in a series of political deals. The Soviet revisionist leadership's series of betrayals have greatly encouraged U.S. imperialism's new war adventures. This proves that the Soviet revisionists are the U.S. imperialists' number one accomplice.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on April 9, the Ceylon Journalists' Association passed a resolution at its annual meeting held on April 8, strongly condemning UN Secretary-General U Thant for peddling the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception in Ceylon regarding the Vietnam issue.

	The resolution pointed out that U Thant's so-called "new proposals" on the Vietnam issue are even more sinister than his previous "proposals."

	The resolution said that these so-called "new proposals" were put forward just after the conclusion of the Guam conference, which was convened by U.S. imperialists to further expand the war of aggression in Vietnam, and received praise from the Johnson administration on the very day they were announced. This fully proves that U Thant is acting according to the instructions of U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists are actively colluding with their accomplices, frantically plotting one scheme after another, in an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

	The resolution called on the governments of Ceylon and other countries to resolutely reject U Thant's "proposals." The resolution emphasized that the only correct way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for U.S. troops to completely withdraw from South Vietnam and let the Vietnamese people decide their own future.

    马来亚《阵线报》揭露苏修是美帝的头号帮凶
    苏修鼓励美帝扩大侵越战争
    锡兰记协强烈谴责吴丹为美国兜售“和谈”骗局
    据新华社八日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近发表评论指出，苏修领导集团的叛卖罪行鼓励了约翰逊进一步扩大侵略的战争冒险。
    评论说，美帝国主义强盗头子约翰逊最近召开的关岛黑会是进一步扩大侵略战争的会议，是任何“和平”言词所掩盖不了的。
    评论指出，约翰逊胆敢在越南和东南亚地区策动新的战争冒险，是苏修领导集团千方百计出卖越南人民抗美救国大业，推行美苏反华、反共“新神圣同盟”政策的必然结果。
    评论揭露，苏修领导集团为了实现这个阴谋，对美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局，卖尽力气，到处奔走献策，同美帝国主义里应外合，向越南人民施加压力。同时，还煽起空前嚣张的反华高潮，展开形形色色的反华活动，并且公然挑拨中越两国人民的兄弟关系。
    评论指出，正当美帝国主义对越南北方进行疯狂轰炸的时候，苏修领导集团却在日内瓦同美国勾结，进行所谓缔结“防止核扩散条约”的谈判，并且进行了一连串的政治交易。苏修领导集团的这一系列的叛卖活动，大大鼓励了美帝国主义新的战争冒险。这就证明了苏修是美帝国主义的不折不扣的头号帮凶。
    新华社科伦坡九日电  锡兰新闻工作者协会八日在这里举行的年会上通过决议，强烈谴责联合国秘书长吴丹在锡兰就越南问题兜售美帝国主义策划的“和谈”骗局。
    决议指出，吴丹提出的关于越南问题的所谓三点“新建议”，实际上比他以前提出的“建议”还要阴险。
    决议说，这些所谓“新建议”是在美帝国主义者为进一步扩大侵越战争而召开的关岛黑会刚刚结束以后提出的，并且在抛出的当天就得到了约翰逊政府的赞赏。这就充分证明，吴丹是按照美帝国主义者的旨意办事的。美帝国主义者积极勾结他们的同谋者，拚命筹划一个又一个的阴谋，妄图迫使越南人民投降。
    决议呼吁锡兰和其他国家的政府坚决拒绝吴丹的“建议”。决议强调指出，解决越南问题的唯一正确的办法是，美国军队必须全部撤出南越，让越南人民决定他们自己的未来。
