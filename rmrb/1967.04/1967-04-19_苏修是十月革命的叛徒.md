The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the first great people's cultural revolution in the world. This revolution is a great triumph of Marxism-Leninism. The Cultural Revolution is aimed at eradicating capitalist and feudal ideologies and thoroughly eliminating the old forces of habit. If this is not done, capitalism will inevitably be restored, as it has been in the Soviet Union today.

The Soviet revisionist leading clique claims to be Marxist-Leninists, but in practice, they have completely deviated from Marxism-Leninism. If, as the Soviet revisionist leading clique claims, they are faithful to Marxism-Leninism and are building socialism, then why do they, like the Western imperialists and their running dogs, slander and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and even more vociferously than the imperialists themselves?

Facts cannot be concealed. Today, the Soviet revisionist leading clique is fraternizing with U.S. imperialism, which oppresses the peoples of the world and sucks the blood of the exploited peoples of the world. The Soviet revisionist leading clique's hostility towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which aims at the thorough elimination of the exploiting classes, shows that today's Soviet revisionist leading clique is a reactionary force opposed to Marxism-Leninism. If the Soviet Union were to carry out a cultural revolution like China's, then after arduous struggles, blood, and sweat to overthrow the bourgeois ruling class and establish the Soviet Union, it would not be like what it is today. It is precisely because the Soviet Union has not carried out a cultural revolution that the achievements of the October Revolution led by Lenin have been betrayed by today's Soviet revisionist clique.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will certainly be victorious. It will make the revolutionary bastion of the world's oppressed peoples even more solid. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is not only a revolution in China but also a great revolution for the oppressed peoples of the world. The victory of this revolution is a great victory for the oppressed peoples of the world over imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

    苏修是十月革命的叛徒
    尼泊尔  米德拉
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是世界上第一次人民的文化革命。这次革命是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。文化大革命是为了根除资本主义和封建主义的思想，彻底清除旧的习惯势力。如果不这样做，资本主义就会重新复辟，正如今天苏联一样。
    苏修领导集团标榜自己是马列主义者，但行动上完全离开了马列主义。如果真象苏修领导集团所说的那样，他们忠实于马列主义、正在进行共产主义建设的话，那么今天中国人民为了铲除封建主义、资本主义而进行的文化大革命，苏修领导集团为什么要象西方帝国主义及其走狗一样诬蔑和破坏中国文化大革命，甚至比他们叫嚣得更厉害呢？
    事实是掩盖不了的。今天苏修领导集团正在同压迫世界人民、吮吸世界被剥削人民鲜血的美帝国主义打得火热。苏修领导集团仇视中国的彻底消灭剥削阶级的文化大革命，这表明今天的苏修领导集团是反对马克思列宁主义的反动派。如果苏联也象中国这样进行文化大革命的话，那么经过艰苦奋斗，流血流汗推翻资产阶级剥削政权而建立起来的苏联，就不会象今天这样了。正是因为苏联没有进行文化大革命，苏联人民在列宁领导下所进行的十月革命的成果才被今天苏修叛徒集团所葬送。
    在毛主席领导下，中国无产阶级文化大革命必将取得胜利。它将使世界被压迫人民的革命堡垒变得更加巩固。中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅是中国的革命，而且是世界被压迫人民的伟大革命。这个革命的胜利是世界被压迫人民对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大胜利。
