The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bolivia recently issued a statement calling on the Bolivian people to unite and crush the plot by the pro-U.S. dictatorship to assassinate Oscar Zamora, the first secretary of the Bolivian Communist Party, and to fight for Bolivia to break free from the colonial status imposed by U.S. imperialism. This is an urgent appeal and a call to battle.

The pro-U.S. sellout regime in Bolivia, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, is stepping up its persecution of Bolivian communists. It brazenly declared the Bolivian Communist Party illegal and plotted to assassinate the outstanding leader of the Bolivian Communist Party, Zamora. This is a counterrevolutionary plot.

The reason the U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries are stepping up their persecution of Bolivian communists is that the Bolivian Communist Party is a genuine revolutionary party. It holds high the banner of revolutionary struggle for national liberation, resolutely opposes the sellout policies of the Bolivian dictatorship, and resolutely opposes U.S. imperialism's control and enslavement of Bolivia. They want to uproot this revolutionary red flag.

The reason the U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries are stepping up their persecution of Bolivian communists is that the Bolivian people are becoming increasingly aware, and the revolutionary struggle is deepening. The reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is becoming more and more unstable. They want to use brutal suppression of revolutionary forces to maintain their shaky reactionary rule.

The reason the U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries are stepping up their persecution of Bolivian communists is also because U.S. imperialism is trying to strengthen its control over the entire "backyard." With the collaboration of the Soviet revisionist clique, it is stirring up a new counterrevolutionary tide in Latin America. Their suppression of the Bolivian Communist Party is part of this evil plan.

However, the U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries' evil plot will absolutely not be able to stop the progress of the Bolivian revolution. Chairman Mao has said: "The various forms of oppression and persecution that the reactionaries of all countries inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The U.S.-Bolivian reactionaries' brutal persecution of the Bolivian Communist Party will definitely meet with strong resistance from the Bolivian people and will inevitably intensify the revolutionary struggle of the Bolivian people and the entire Latin American people.

The Bolivian people, the people of Latin America, and the people of all countries in the world should stand up to oppose the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' evil actions of suppressing the Bolivian Communist Party, force them to rescind the illegal decision to declare the Bolivian Communist Party illegal, and restore the freedom of the Bolivian Communist Party leader Zamora!

### 美玻反动派，住手！

    美玻反动派，住手！
    玻利维亚共产党中央委员会最近发表声明，号召玻利维亚人民团结起来，为粉碎亲美独裁政权谋杀玻共第一书记奥斯卡·萨莫拉的罪恶阴谋，为使玻利维亚摆脱美帝国主义的殖民地的地位而斗争。这是一个紧急的呼吁，也是一个战斗的号召。
    玻利维亚亲美卖国政权，在美帝国主义的指使下，正在加紧迫害玻利维亚共产党人。它悍然宣布玻利维亚共产党为非法，并且策划杀害玻共的杰出的领导人萨莫拉。这是一个反革命的罪恶阴谋。
    美玻反动派之所以要加紧迫害玻利维亚共产党人，是因为玻利维亚共产党是真正的革命党，它高举争取民族解放的革命旗帜，坚决反对玻利维亚独裁政权的卖国政策，坚决反对美帝国主义对玻利维亚的控制和奴役。他们妄想拔掉这面革命的红旗。
    美玻反动派之所以要加紧迫害玻利维亚共产党人，是因为玻利维亚人民日益觉醒，革命的斗争深入发展，美帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治越来越不稳。他们妄想用残酷镇压革命力量的手段来维持摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    美玻反动派之所以要加紧迫害玻利维亚共产党人，还因为美帝国主义正在力图加强对整个“后院”的控制，在苏联修正主义集团的配合下，在拉丁美洲掀起一股反革命的新逆流。他们对玻利维亚共产党的镇压，就是这个罪恶计划的一部分。
    但是，美玻反动派的这种罪恶阴谋是绝对阻止不了玻利维亚革命斗争的进程的。毛主席说过：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”美玻反动派对玻利维亚共产党的残酷迫害，一定要遭到玻利维亚人民的强烈反抗，而且必将促使玻利维亚人民和整个拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争更加高涨。
    玻利维亚人民、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民，都应当起来反对美帝国主义及其走狗镇压玻利维亚共产党的罪恶行动，迫使他们取消宣布玻利维亚共产党非法的无理决定，恢复玻共领导人萨莫拉的自由！
