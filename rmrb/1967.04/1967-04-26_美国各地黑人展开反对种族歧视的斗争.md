Hundreds of black residents in Louisville, Kentucky, have been engaged in a week-long struggle against severe racial discrimination in housing rentals and sales. This is the longest-running anti-discrimination protest by blacks this year.

Starting on the 14th, demonstrators, including some white supporters, defied official bans and disruptions by white supremacists to take to the streets every night to protest. The police responded with brutal repression, repeatedly using tear gas to disperse the crowds. Many demonstrators were arrested. However, the black protesters were undeterred and vowed to continue their protests.

In Cleveland, Ohio, a group of black youth fought bravely against the police throughout the night of the 16th in resistance to racial discrimination. Angry protesters threw stones and glass bottles at the police and their vehicles, and vandalized several shops and pawnshops in the black neighborhood that had been exploiting black residents.

In Nashville, Tennessee, over 200 black youth and a few white youth held a demonstration on the 14th. They sang black struggle songs and marched to the courthouse to demand the immediate release of black students who had been illegally arrested a few days earlier for participating in the anti-discrimination struggle.

Nearly 100 black students at a university in southern Texas held an all-night protest at the Harris County courthouse, demanding the immediate release of three black protest leaders who had been illegally arrested. The students vowed to continue their protest until the three leaders were freed.

In Philadelphia, some black teachers and students held a demonstration at a high school to protest a white teacher's racial slurs during a class. The demonstration turned into a conflict between black students and white racist students. Later, the authorities sent over a hundred armed police into the school to "maintain order."

    美国各地黑人展开反对种族歧视的斗争
    肯塔基州路易斯维尔市数百名黑人群众为反对在租赁和出售住房方面存在的严重种族歧视而进行的斗争，到二十日晚间为止已经持续了整整一星期。这是今年以来持续时间较长的一次黑人反歧视斗争。
    从十四日开始，示威群众（其中包括一部分支持黑人的白人示威者）不顾当局的禁令和白人种族主义者的捣乱，每天晚上都走上街头举行抗议示威。警察进行了疯狂镇压，并曾多次施放催泪性毒瓦斯来驱散示威群众。大批示威者遭到逮捕。但是黑人示威者并没有被吓倒，他们表示，抗议示威将继续进行下去。
    俄亥俄州克利夫兰市一批黑人青年十六日晚上由于反抗种族歧视，同前来镇压的警察进行了一整夜的英勇搏斗。愤怒的示威者向警察和警车投掷石块和玻璃瓶，并且捣毁了黑人区内好几家平日剥削黑人特别厉害的商店和当铺。
    在田纳西州的纳什维尔市，两百多名黑人青年和少数白人青年十四日举行示威游行。他们高唱黑人战斗歌曲，前往市法院门前示威，要求当局立即释放几天前由于参加反种族歧视斗争而被非法逮捕的黑人大学生。
    得克萨斯州南方大学近百名黑人学生在哈里斯县法院门口举行彻夜示威，要求当局立即释放遭非法逮捕的三名黑人示威领导人。示威学生表示，他们的示威将坚持到三位领导人获释为止。
    费城某中学的部分黑人师生举行示威，抗议一名白人教员在讲课时辱骂黑人。示威学生和白人学生中的种族主义分子发生了冲突。后来，当局竟派遣了一百多名武装警察进入这所学校“维持秩序”。
