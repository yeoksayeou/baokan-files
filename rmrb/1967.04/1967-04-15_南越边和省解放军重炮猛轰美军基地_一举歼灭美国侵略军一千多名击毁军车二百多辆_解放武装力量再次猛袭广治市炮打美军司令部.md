The heroic liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam launched another fierce artillery attack on the base of the U.S. 11th Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment on the night of April 2. They annihilated over 1,000 U.S. invaders, destroyed over 200 military vehicles (most of which were tanks and armored cars), destroyed 30 artillery pieces and 34 helicopters, and burned down 80 tents.

This U.S. armored cavalry regiment, which was transferred to South Vietnam last September, was stationed in the Thuong Duong area south of Spring Loc. It had just retreated back to the Thuong Duong base after suffering a heavy defeat at the hands of the liberation armed forces in the northern battlefield of Ninh Thuan Province.

Just three hours after this U.S. invading force returned to the Thuong Duong base, the liberation armed forces launched a surprise attack. Thousands of shells accurately hit the barracks, parking lot, helipad, and artillery positions within the base, turning it into a sea of fire.

This was the second attack by the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province on the base of the U.S. 11th Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment. In their first attack on November 16 of last year, the liberation armed forces annihilated over 150 U.S. invaders and destroyed 140 military vehicles.

The newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published commentaries on April 14, pointing out that the recent fierce attack by the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province on the base of the U.S. 11th Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment not only inflicted heavy losses on the U.S. aggressors in terms of manpower but also marked the shameful failure of the U.S. aggressors' so-called "new tactics."

According to a report from Saigon on April 14, the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam launched another fierce attack on the provincial capital of Quang Tri and its surrounding areas in the early hours of April 13. Shells rained down on the city and its outskirts, hitting the U.S. command headquarters and destroying two bridges in the southern suburbs.

Western news agencies reported that the attack by the liberation armed forces lasted for over three hours, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and chaos. A heavily guarded railway and road bridge in the southern part of the city and another major road and railway bridge south of Quang Tri and north of Da Nang were blown up, directly threatening the supply and transportation of military supplies for the U.S. and puppet forces. At the same time, another road and railway bridge south of Quang Tri and north of Da Nang was blown up by guerrillas, collapsing two sections.

U.S. military authorities lamented, "Repairing this road and railway bridge may take three months."

This attack by the liberation armed forces came on the heels of their fierce attack on Quang Tri City and its surrounding areas on March 6.

    南越边和省解放军重炮猛轰美军基地
    一举歼灭美国侵略军一千多名击毁军车二百多辆
    解放武装力量再次猛袭广治市炮打美军司令部
    据新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英雄的越南南方边和省解放武装力量，四月二日夜间又一次猛烈炮击美国第十一独立装甲团基地，一举歼灭美国侵略军一千多名，击毁军车二百多辆（绝大部分是坦克、装甲车），击毁大炮三十门和直升飞机三十四架，烧毁帐篷八十座。
    这个在去年九月调来南越的美军装甲团驻扎在春禄镇以南的帅任地区，是在西宁省北部战场上遭到解放武装力量痛击后刚刚撤退回来的。
    解放武装力量在这支美国侵略军回到帅任基地仅有三个小时，就对他们发动了袭击。数以千计的炮弹准确地击中基地上的营房区、停车场、停机坪和炮兵阵地，顿时变成一片火海。
    这是边和省解放武装力量对美军第十一独立装甲团基地发起的第二次袭击。在去年十一月十六日第一次袭击中，解放武装力量消灭美国侵略军一百五十多名，击毁军车一百四十辆。
    越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》十四日分别发表评论指出，越南南方边和省解放武装力量最近猛烈袭击美国侵略军第十一独立装甲团基地，不仅使美国强盗在兵力方面遭到惨重损失，而且也宣告了美国强盗的所谓“新战术”的可耻破产。
    据新华社十四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十三日凌晨再次猛烈袭击广治省省会广治市和它的周围，炮弹纷纷落到广治市内外，击中了美军司令部，炸毁了城南郊的两座桥梁。
    西方通讯社的消息透露，解放武装力量的袭击持续了三个多小时，打得敌人狼狈不堪，死伤累累。位于城南、守卫森严的一座铁路桥和一座公路铁路桥被炸毁了，从而直接威胁了美伪军的军需品的补给和运输。和这同时，广治市以南、岘港以北的另一座公路铁路大桥也被游击队炸塌了两节。
    美国军事当局哀叹说：“修复这座公路铁路大桥可能需要三个月。”
    解放武装力量的这次袭击，是紧接着三月六日他们对广治市和它的周围猛烈袭击之后发动的。
