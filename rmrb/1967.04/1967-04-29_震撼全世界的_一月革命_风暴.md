The "January Revolution" storm, which began in Shanghai, quickly swept across the entire country and shook the world.

The significance of the "January Revolution" lies in the fact that, under the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, tens of millions of revolutionary masses launched a struggle from the bottom up to seize power. They exposed a handful of Khrushchev-like figures—those in power within the Party who were taking the capitalist road—and stripped them of their power, smashing their plot to restore capitalism in China. This nationwide, comprehensive class struggle is a great strategic battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." This great teaching has pointed the way for us revolutionaries of the proletariat and inspired our fighting spirit. The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai achieved great unity and, where necessary, resolutely struggled to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. This power was seized correctly and well! Those who wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism have been finished, and the former giants have collapsed.

In these days filled with revolutionary storms, the waves of the revolutionary mass movement surged and roared, and new revolutionary things emerged one after another.

Revolutionary people around the world cheered, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an event of immeasurable world significance," "It is a thunderbolt on a clear day, and it tolls the death knell for imperialism." The international reactionaries wailed, and even the brain trust of the American ruling class, Lippmann, had to admit dejectedly, "The revolution taking place in China can be compared to the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917, although it is on a larger scale and perhaps even more ominous."

"Rebellion is justified." The rebellion has frightened the imperialists and the Soviet revisionists. The bigwigs of the Soviet revisionists, Brezhnev and Kosygin, jumped out, filled with both rage and sorrow, pounding their chests and feet, cursing our proletarian dictatorship as a "dictatorial regime." They mourned the misfortune of a handful of Khrushchev-like figures in China who had lost power and expressed "sympathy for them." This incident shows that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution strikes at domestic revisionism and hurts international revisionism to the core.

The Soviet revisionist leaders hear the word "seize power" and their nerves instinctively panic. They go into a hysterical fit, shouting things like "tension and terror," "lawlessness," "anarchy," and so on, cursing and spitting out filth like dumping dirty water. This is, of course, not surprising.

Soviet revisionist lords, do you feel "tension and terror"? Excellent, our joy is your sorrow, and your "tension and terror" makes us all the more delighted.

What are the Soviet revisionists afraid of? It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary Red Guards, the big-character posters on the streets, the great debates, the great democracy of the proletariat, and the mobilization of tens of millions of people from the bottom up under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. What is happening in China today foreshadows the future of the world. The red flag of the Great October Revolution and the red flag of Leninism will once again fly over the Kremlin! Whether they curse or rage, they cannot stop the advance of the locomotive of history! One day, the Soviet revisionist lords will be smashed to pieces in a new revolutionary storm!

"Lawlessness"? Gentlemen of the Soviet revisionists! You are right, under the rule of your Soviet revisionist leadership, the Soviet people today still cannot be "lawless." In your country, people do not have the freedom to demonstrate against imperialist aggression, the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association to carry out revolution, or the freedom to overthrow your revisionist bureaucratic apparatus. In short, in your country, there is only bourgeois freedom, not proletarian freedom. But here, under the proletarian dictatorship, great democracy is fully at work. The reactionary line of the bourgeoisie has been subjected to fatal criticism, and all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of capitalism, revisionism, and feudalism have been subjected to destructive blows. In short, all old things of the bourgeoisie, all things that do not conform to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, must be overthrown. All that stuff, we are indeed "lawless." Otherwise, it wouldn't be called a revolution!

"Anarchy"? For you bunch of traitors to the working class, you will never understand what a revolutionary mass movement is, what proletarian dictatorship under revolution is. There is chaos. This is the chaos of the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who have lost control. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution under proletarian dictatorship. We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that guides everything, a solid proletarian dictatorship, and a powerful People's Liberation Army as our support. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, tens of millions of revolutionary people seize back all the power usurped by the revisionists and establish a new revolutionary order, establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ of the proletariat. Our strength has grown.

All of this is precisely what the Soviet revisionist leadership finds most headache-inducing and frightening. What's so strange about that? They are like owls who are afraid of the sunlight, afraid of the truth!

In the footsteps of the great "January Revolution" advancing through history, the buzzing of a few flies hitting the wall can be heard, a few wails, a few sobs. Their few cries of despair cannot save them from their inevitable doom.

The great "January Revolution" is developing! History is advancing! Let the Soviet revisionists tremble before the storm of the great "January Revolution"!

### 震撼全世界的“一月革命”风暴

    震撼全世界的“一月革命”风暴
    上海革命职工　钟平　吴宣
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”
    伟大的“一月革命”风暴，从上海开始，很快就席卷全中国，震撼全世界。
    “一月革命”的重要意义在于，亿万革命群众在伟大统帅毛主席的号召下，发动了一场自下而上的夺权斗争，把那一小撮赫鲁晓夫式的人物——党内走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，剥夺他们的权力，粉碎了他们企图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋。这场全国全面展开的阶级斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级之间具有伟大战略意义的大决战。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”这一伟大的教导给我们无产阶级革命派指明了方向，鼓舞了斗志。我们上海无产阶级革命派实现了大联合，在需要夺权的地方，毅然决然地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了夺权斗争。这个权夺得对，夺得好！披着马列主义外衣的一小撮资产阶级老爷们完蛋了，昔日的庞然大物轰然崩溃了。
    在这些充满革命暴风雨的日子里，革命群众运动的浪涛汹涌澎湃，革命的新生事物不断涌现。
    全世界革命人民欢呼：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是一个具有无可估量的世界意义的事件”，“是一个晴天霹雳，它为帝国主义敲了丧钟”。国际反动派发出了哀鸣，连美国统治阶级的智囊人物李普曼也不得不垂头丧气地承认：“中国正在经历的一次革命可以同一七八九年的法国大革命和一九一七年的俄国革命相比，虽然它的规模更大，而且也许是更加预兆不祥的。”
    “造反有理。”造反吓破了帝国主义和苏联修正主义的胆。苏修大头目勃列日涅夫和柯西金跳了出来，又是愤恨，又是悲切，捶胸顿足地骂我们无产阶级专政是什么“独裁政权”。他们为被夺了权的一小撮中国的赫鲁晓夫式人物的厄运而伤心落泪，表示“同情他们”。这件事表明：我国无产阶级文化大革命，打在国内修正主义的身上，痛在国际修正主义的心上。
    苏修领导集团一听到“夺权”两字，连他们的神经器官都本能地恐慌起来，于是就歇斯底里大发作，什么“紧张恐怖”呀，“无法无天”呀，“无政府状态”呀，等等，恶言咒语象倒脏水似地泼撒出来。这当然是毫不为怪的。
    苏联修正主义老爷们，你们感到“紧张恐怖”吗？好极了，我们的欢乐正是你们的悲哀，你们“紧张恐怖”，当然我们就兴高采烈了。
    苏修害怕的是什么？是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是革命的红卫兵，是大字报上街，是大鸣大放大辩论，是无产阶级的大民主，是千百万群众在毛泽东思想的指引下自下而上地动员起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。今日中国发生的一切，预示着世界发展的未来。伟大十月革命的红旗、列宁主义的红旗必将重新飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空！咒骂也罢，暴跳也罢，都不能阻止历史火车头的前进！总有一天，苏修老爷们会在新的革命风暴中被打得粉身碎骨！
    “无法无天”吗？苏修先生们！你们说对了，在你们苏修领导集团的统治之下，今天苏联人民还不能“无法无天”。在你们那里，人民没有上街示威反对帝国主义侵略的自由，没有言论、出版、集会、结社进行革命的自由，没有打倒你们修正主义官僚机构的自由。一句话，在你们那里，只有资产阶级的自由，没有无产阶级的自由。可是在我们这里，无产阶级专政下的大民主充分发挥作用，资产阶级反动路线已受到致命的批判，一切资本主义、修正主义、封建主义的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯都受到了毁灭性的打击。总之，凡是一切资产阶级的旧事物，一切不符合马列主义、毛泽东思想的东西，统统都要打倒。什么资产阶级的物质刺激、利润原则，什么修正主义的哲学、经济学、历史学、文学艺术，统统都要批判。对这套东西，我们确是“无法无天”。不然，还叫什么革命！
    “无政府状态”吗？对你们这伙工人阶级的叛徒来说，是始终不会懂得什么叫革命的群众运动，什么叫无产阶级专政下的革命的。乱，有的。这是使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派乱了套，失去了控制。我们无产阶级文化大革命是无产阶级专政下的革命，我们有统帅一切的光焰无际的毛泽东思想，有巩固的无产阶级专政，有强大的解放军为后盾。亿万革命人民在无产阶级专政的条件下，把被修正主义分子篡夺了的一切权力夺过来，建立革命的新秩序，建立革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”临时权力机构，我们的力量强大了。
    所有这些，正是苏修领导集团感到最头痛、最害怕的。这有什么奇怪呢？他们原来就是如同猫头鹰害怕阳光那样的害怕真理！
    在伟大的“一月革命”的历史前进的脚步声中，传来了一小撮碰壁苍蝇的嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。它们的几声哀鸣，是挽救不了它们必然灭顶的厄运的。
    伟大的“一月革命”在发展！历史在前进！让苏修在伟大的“一月革命”风暴面前发抖吧！
