Japanese revolutionary people, in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, are eagerly studying and striving to master the highest level of Marxism-Leninism today—Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's works have been bestsellers in Japan.

A progressive bookstore in Tokyo has received a large number of letters from readers this year, requesting that they send them copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." These letters come from all over Japan, from readers in large, medium, and small cities, as well as from rural areas.

A worker from Tokyo's Itabashi Ward said, "Not only do the Japanese people urgently need to study Mao Zedong Thought, but people all over the world are studying it. This is a great thing. That's why imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries are so terrified." An employee of a Tokyo company said, "In our struggle against imperialism and revisionism, the Japanese people increasingly need Mao Zedong Thought because it is the treasure of revolution." A worker from Osaka enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought as the highest level of Marxism-Leninism today, and as the guiding star for the liberation struggles of oppressed peoples worldwide.

A taxi driver from Osaka said, "Chairman Mao's works are deeply engraved in the hearts of the Japanese people. On the road ahead, no matter what happens or how great the difficulties, I have made up my mind to press forward bravely and never leave the ranks of the fighters. I will study and apply Chairman Mao's works every day, use Mao Zedong Thought, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and fight to the end against American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their faithful running dogs." He enthusiastically shouted long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China! Long live the Red Guards!

Among the many letters from readers, quite a few people expressed their desire to buy two or three copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and some even wanted to buy ten or more copies for Mao Zedong Thought study groups or study sessions.

As the invincible Mao Zedong Thought spreads more widely in Japan, the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is also expanding. Chairman Mao's brilliant works, such as the "Old Three Articles," "On New Democracy," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," are selling more and more. To meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of Japanese revolutionary people, the Dai'an Bookstore in Tokyo, following the publication of the "Old Three Articles" by the Zhonghua Bookstore, compiled and published at the end of last month a collection of Chairman Mao's brilliant works, including the "Old Three Articles," "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," which has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

    毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马列主义
    日本革命人民在同帝修反斗争中如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作
    据新华社东京六日电  日本革命人民在同帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派进行的斗争中，如饥似渴地学习和要求掌握当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，毛主席著作在日本一直是畅销书。
    东京一家进步书店，今年以来收到大批读者来信，要求给他们寄《毛主席语录》。这些信来自日本全国各地，既有大中小城市的读者，也有农村读者。
    东京板桥区的一个工人说，不仅日本人民迫切要求学习毛泽东思想，现在全世界人民都在学习毛泽东思想，这是一件大好事。正因为如此，帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派才害怕得要命。东京的一个公司职员说，日本人民在进行反帝反修斗争中，越来越迫切地需要毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想是革命的法宝。住在大阪的一位工人热烈赞扬毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是全世界被压迫人民进行解放斗争的导航的星斗。
    大阪一位出租汽车司机说，毛主席的著作深深地印在日本人民的灵魂深处。在前进的道路上，无论发生什么情况，出现多么大的困难，我都已经下定决心，勇往直前，绝不离开战斗队伍。他表示要每天活学活用毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想，遵循毛主席指引的方向，同美帝国主义和苏联修正主义及其忠实走卒斗争到底。他怀着无限的激情热烈欢呼伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！红卫兵万岁！
    在大批的读者来信中，有不少人表示要买两本、三本《毛主席语录》，还有的为了在毛泽东思想学习会或学习小组把《毛主席语录》作为学习文件，一次就要十本或者更多本。
    随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想在日本日益广泛传播，中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响日益扩大，毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”、《新民主主义论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等单行本，销售得越来越多。为了满足广大日本革命人民的迫切需要，东京的大安书店，继中华书店出版“老三篇”之后，上月底把中国人民作为座右铭进行学习的“老三篇”和《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等毛主席的光辉著作汇编成册，出版发行，受到日本广大人民的热烈欢迎。
