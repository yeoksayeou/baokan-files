The Red Rock Chemical Factory in Guiyang Correctly Implements Chairman Mao's Policies on Cadres
Unite the Majority of Cadres and Focus on Revolution to Promote Production

After the revolutionary faction seized power, they thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," established a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team, and brought about a new look in both revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 26th: After the proletarian revolutionary faction took control of the Red Rock Chemical Factory, they thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in cadre issues. They established a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team, united the majority of cadres, isolated a small number of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, and the factory's production has risen sharply.

The factory has seven cadre leaders at the factory level. Among them, two revolutionary leaders participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership core, and three erring directors and deputy directors also initially recognized and examined their mistakes and participated in appropriate work. During the process of absorbing revolutionary cadre leaders to participate in the "three-in-one" leadership team and helping erring cadres to "come forward" and arranging their work, the factory consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in cadre issues. In the struggle, the revolutionary faction did meticulous ideological work and took effective measures.

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, a small number of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road in this factory suppressed many revolutionary cadres and workers, labeling them as "monsters and demons" and "active counter-revolutionaries" to protect themselves. Under this white terror, a deputy director who had once been an old Red Army soldier stood up and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary faction, thoroughly exposing the secrets of the party's power-holders who were taking the capitalist road in suppressing revolutionary cadres and masses. An original member of the party committee and a union leader had secretly supported revolutionary workers in establishing revolutionary rebel organizations, helping the revolutionary faction overcome the weaknesses of dispersed targets and scattered firepower, and providing materials related to the inner workings of the party's power-holders who were taking the capitalist road. They helped them hold several successful struggle meetings. However, during the process of establishing the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" and a lack of deep understanding of the party's policies on cadres, some workers were suspicious and distrustful of the two leaders participating in the "three-in-one" leadership core. The deputy director who had been an old Red Army soldier had some shortcomings in work and life in the past, and someone said he was a cadre "living off his past merits," not an ideal candidate for the combination. The union leader, who had once been a member of the old Cultural Revolution Committee, secretly supported the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary faction. Some comrades did not fully understand this, and some underestimated his revolutionary actions, saying he was showing only "half of himself" and had "opportunistic" tendencies, making him untrustworthy.

How should the masses deal with their distrust of these two revolutionary cadre leaders? The revolutionary faction organized the masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and the editorial of the fourth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine to eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line. Through study, everyone deeply realized that the key to evaluating cadres is whether they stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or the bourgeois reactionary line. Everyone used the party's policies to analyze the deputy director, and unanimously agreed to his participation in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership core.

The revolutionary faction took the approach of "helping out" for the union leader, organizing the relevant personnel who had secretly supported the revolutionary faction to introduce the facts, allowing the broad masses to have a clearer understanding of this revolutionary cadre leader's support for the revolutionary faction. This cadre leader also, with the help of the revolutionary faction, actively went to the workshop to work shifts, examined his shortcomings and mistakes, and listened to the criticism of the worker comrades. In this way, the masses got to know him, trusted him, and unanimously agreed to include him in the "three-in-one" leadership team.

The factory director and two deputy directors had, to varying degrees, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line or committed economic errors during the movement.

How should these three cadre leaders be treated? At the beginning, some people proposed: these three cadre leaders have made mistakes and are all untrustworthy, and they should not be arranged to work in leadership positions. The conservatives in the factory, in order to help the party's small number of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road pass inspection, also took the opportunity to spread fallacies, saying things like "arranging work for erring cadre leaders is to seek compromise," and so on, attempting to disrupt the ranks.

In the face of the above discussions, the revolutionary faction in the factory again reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues. Chairman Mao taught: "Anyone who makes a mistake, as long as he does not hide his illness and fear treatment, does not stubbornly persist in his mistakes to the point of being beyond redemption, but is honest and truly willing to be treated and corrected, we should welcome him, cure his illness, and turn him into a good comrade." Chairman Mao also taught: "We should not only look at a cadre's temporary actions, but also at the cadre's entire history and all his work." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary faction in the factory used the method of class analysis to analyze the nature of the mistakes made by these three cadre leaders, their past situations, and their recognition and performance of mistakes during the Cultural Revolution. The first deputy director, although he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement, was not conscious of it and was very different from the party's small number of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road in the factory. During the movement, he was able to recognize his mistakes after being criticized and helped many times by the revolutionary faction, and exposed the problems of the party's small number of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road. Looking at this cadre leader's past situation, he was still a relatively good cadre. The other two cadre leaders, after being criticized and educated by the revolutionary faction, also made examinations. After analysis and discussion, the revolutionary faction believed: the nature of the mistakes made by these three cadre leaders all belonged to contradictions within the people, and they should be given the opportunity to make amends and redeem themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the illness to save the person," and "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades." For this reason, the comrades of the revolutionary faction called these three cadre leaders together, pointed out the seriousness of their mistakes, asked them to continue exposing and further examining their mistakes to the masses, and at the same time, retained and arranged them to do appropriate leadership work under the supervision of the revolutionary faction to take up production and make amends.

After the temporary power organ of the factory arranged their work, these three cadre leaders all changed their past bad habits of being aloof and bossy in their work, went deep into the workshops, and together with the revolutionary workers, came up with ideas for production, and together exposed the problems of the party's small number of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road. One deputy director, after being arranged to lead the production work in the sulfuric acid workshop, the comrades of the revolutionary faction in the workshop encouraged him to take responsibility, enthusiastically supported him to do a good job, and in mid-March this year, in order to produce more sulfuric acid, the equipment needed to be overhauled. This deputy director personally climbed to the furnace mouth with a temperature of about 150 degrees, and together with the workshop workers, fought for five days, completing the overhaul task at an unprecedented speed. Another deputy director, after being arranged to lead the supply and marketing work, was very active in his work. Once, he found that the factory had few minerals and insufficient transportation capacity, so he immediately reported this situation to the revolutionary faction and personally solved the problem, ensuring the supply of minerals and the normal operation of production.

The revolutionary faction of the Red Rock Chemical Factory also adopted the policy of differentiating treatment for the cadres in the workshops and offices. For cadres who had made mistakes, they insisted on following Chairman Mao's teachings and adopting the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the illness to save the person." Therefore, the entire factory won over and united the majority of cadres, isolated and struck down a small number, and quickly established a new production order. The factory's revolution and production presented a new look. Before the revolutionary faction seized power a few months ago, due to the sabotage of the party's small number of power-holders who were taking the capitalist road, the factory had not completed the production plan. After seizing power in March this year, production has been rising sharply. Fertilizers and sulfuric acid have all over-fulfilled the March plan, and the quality of fertilizers has all reached the first-grade standard.

    贵阳红岩化工厂正确执行毛主席的干部政策
    团结干部大多数　狠抓革命促生产
    革命派夺权后，彻底批判了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，建立了革命的“三结合”领导班子，革命和生产出现崭新面貌
    据新华社贵阳二十六日电　贵阳红岩化工厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，彻底批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，建立了革命的“三结合”领导班子，团结了大多数干部，孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，全厂的生产也直线上升。
    这个工厂有七个厂级领导干部。其中有两个革命的领导干部参加了革命的“三结合”领导核心，三个犯错误的正副厂长，也初步认识和检查了自己的错误，参加了适当的工作。这个厂在吸收革命领导干部参加“三结合”领导班子的过程中，在帮助犯错误的干部“亮相”和安排他们的工作的过程中，都贯穿着坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，批判在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的斗争。在斗争中，革命派做了细致的思想工作，采取了有效的措施。
    这个工厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在文化大革命初期，把厂里许多革命干部和职工打成“牛鬼蛇神”、“现行反革命”，以保护自己过关。就在这白色恐怖的情况下，一位当过老红军的副厂长挺身而出，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，彻底揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派镇压革命干部和革命群众的内幕。原党委委员、工会负责人，曾暗中支持革命职工建立革命造反组织，帮助革命派克服斗争目标分散、火力不集中的缺点，为革命派提供有关党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的内情材料，帮助他们连续开好了几次斗争大会。可是，在建立革命的“三结合”领导班子的过程中，由于部分职工受到了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的影响，对党的干部政策又缺乏深刻的理解，他们对这两位领导干部参加“三结合”的领导核心，表示怀疑，不信任。当过老红军的副厂长，过去在工作和生活上有些缺点，有人就说他是“吃老本”的干部，不是理想的结合对象。厂工会的负责人，曾经是厂里旧文化革命委员会的成员，他暗中支持革命派的革命行动，有的同志不大了解，有的对他的这种革命行动估计不足，说他亮的是个“半身相”，有“投机”嫌疑，不可信赖。
    一些群众对这两位革命的领导干部不信任怎么办呢？革命派组织群众认真学习毛主席的干部政策和《红旗》杂志第四期社论，消除资产阶级反动路线的影响。经过学习，大家深刻地认识到，看干部主要看他是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线这一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边。大家用党的政策来分析那位副厂长，就一致同意了他参加革命的“三结合”领导核心。
    革命派对工会负责人采取“帮一把”的办法，组织他曾经暗中支持过的革命派有关人员介绍实情，让广大群众更清楚地了解这位革命领导干部支持革命派的活动。这位领导干部也在革命派的帮助下，主动到车间顶班劳动，检查自己的缺点和错误，听取工人同志的批评。这样一来，群众了解了他，信任了他，一致同意吸收他参加“三结合”的领导班子。
    这个厂的厂长和两个副厂长，在运动中曾经不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线，或犯了经济主义的错误。
    对于这三个领导干部如何对待？一开始，有的人就提出：这三个领导干部有错误，都是信不过的人，不能安排他们在领导岗位上工作。厂里保守派的人为了保党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派过关，也乘机大肆散布谬论，说什么“安排犯错误的领导干部的工作，就是搞调和”，等等，企图扰乱阵线。
    厂里的革命派在上述议论面前，又重温了毛主席对干部问题的有关指示。毛主席教导说：“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”毛主席又教导说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”。根据毛主席的教导，厂里的革命派用阶级分析的方法，分析了这三个领导干部的错误性质和他们过去的情况，以及他们在文化革命中对错误的认识程度和表现。第一个副厂长，虽然在运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，但不是自觉的，与厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派有很大的不同。在运动中，他经过革命派的批判和多次耐心帮助，尚能认识错误，并揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的问题。从这个领导干部过去的情况来看，也还是一个比较好的干部。另外两个领导干部，经过革命派的批判和教育，都分别作了检查。经过分析讨论，革命派认为：这三个领导干部的错误性质，都属于人民内部矛盾，应该根据毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”，“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导，给他们立功补过的机会。为此，革命派的同志把这三个领导干部召集起来，分别指出他们错误的严重性，要他们继续揭发和向群众进一步作检查，同时，留任并安排他们作适当的领导工作，在革命派的监督下，把生产抓起来，立功补过。
    在厂里的临时权力机构安排他们的工作后，这三个领导干部都改变过去在工作中高高在上，指手划脚的坏作风，深入车间，同革命职工一起出主意搞生产，一起揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题。有一位副厂长被安排到硫酸车间负责生产领导工作后，车间革命派的同志就鼓励他负起责任来，热情支持他搞好工作。今年三月中旬，为了更多地增产硫酸，要检修设备。这位副厂长就亲自爬到温度高达一百五十度左右的沸腾炉口操作，与车间的职工一道奋战五天，以从来未有的速度，提前完成了检修任务。另一位副厂长被安排负责供销领导工作后，工作非常积极。有一次，他发现厂里矿石不多，运输力量又不足，他就立即向革命派汇报了这一情况，并亲自解决了这个问题，保证了矿石的供应，使生产正常进行。
    红岩化工厂革命派，对于车间和科室的干部，也都采取了区别对待的方针。对于犯有错误的干部，都坚持按毛主席的教导，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。因此，全厂争取和团结了干部的大多数，孤立和打击了一小撮，同时也迅速建立了新的生产秩序，全厂的革命和生产出现了崭新的面貌。革命派未夺权以前的几个月，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的破坏，厂里一直没有完成生产计划。今年三月夺权后，生产一直直线上升，化肥、硫酸都超额完成了三月份的计划，化肥质量全部达到一级品标准。
