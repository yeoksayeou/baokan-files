Title: Thoroughly Settle Accounts and Thoroughly Criticize

The film "The Last Emperor" is a poisonous weed. It openly stands on the reactionary stance of imperialism, feudalism, and the bourgeoisie, slandering the revolutionary mass movements and the revolutionary people's heroic struggles against imperialism and feudalism. Shamelessly, it advocates for nationalism and class capitulationism. A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the top capitalist-roaders within the party openly praise this extremely reactionary film as "patriotic," resisting Chairman Mao's directive to criticize this treacherous film. This is a blatant opposition to our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought! This crime must be thoroughly settled, and this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backers must be thoroughly overthrown!

A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the top capitalist-roaders within the party praise the reactionary film "The Last Emperor," fully exposing their extremely shameful slave mentality towards imperialism. Can imperialism help the Chinese people? Can imperialism truly bring peace to the people? Chairman Mao teaches us, "Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they can never become Buddhas." The nature of imperialism will not change. I participated in the Korean War, and I personally witnessed many innocent Korean people being slaughtered by the vicious American aggressors, many houses reduced to ruins, and many fields left barren. Is this the peace that the U.S. imperialists bring? Is this the help that the U.S. imperialists bring to the Korean people? The top capitalist-roaders within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists whitewash the crimes of imperialism, fully exposing their "philosophy of survival." They themselves do not revolutionize, and they oppose others from revolutionizing. Chairman Mao teaches us that in the face of the imperialist beast, the revolutionary people must not have the slightest bit of cowardice. Our army's experience in the Korean battlefield proves: only by engaging in a head-on struggle with the enemy can we achieve complete and thorough victory.

The top capitalist-roader within the party praises the reactionary film "The Last Emperor," fully exposing his reactionary and ugly soul, confessing his crimes. For seventeen years, under his support, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists have done nothing but evil. We must, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, bravely join the battle, overthrow and expose the top capitalist-roader within the party, thoroughly criticize and purge the poison of the capitalist reactionary line in all aspects, sweep away the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We will plant the great red flag of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought all over China and all over the world!

    彻底清算  彻底批判
    空军战斗英雄　张积慧
    影片《清宫秘史》是一株大毒草，它公开站在帝国主义、封建主义和资产阶级反动立场上，污蔑革命群众运动，污蔑革命人民反帝反封建的英勇斗争，恬不知耻地宣扬民族投降主义和阶级投降主义。一小撮反革命修正主义分子和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派公然宣扬这部反动透顶的影片是“爱国主义”的，抗拒毛主席关于批判这部卖国主义影片的指示。这是明目张胆地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想！对于这一罪行，必须彻底清算，必须把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的后台老板彻底打倒！
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，完全暴露了他们一副极端可耻的崇拜帝国主义的奴才相。帝国主义能帮助中国人民吗？帝国主义真的能给人民以和平吗？毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。我参加过抗美援朝战争，亲眼看见过许多无辜的朝鲜人民被万恶的美国强盗杀害了，许多房屋被炸成一片废墟，许多田地荒芜了。这是美帝实施的和平吗？这是美帝给朝鲜人民的帮助吗？党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子美化帝国主义的罪行，就是他们的“活命哲学”的大暴露。他们自己不革命，又反对别人革命。毛主席教导我们，在帝国主义野兽面前，革命的人民不可以有丝毫的怯懦。我军在朝鲜战场上跟美国侵略者较量的经验证明：同敌人只有进行针锋相对的斗争，才能获得完全彻底的胜利。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派如此吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》，正是他的反动的丑恶灵魂的大暴露，是他的罪行的自供。十七年来，在他的支持下，一小撮反革命修正主义分子作尽了坏事。我们一定要在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，高举革命的批判的旗帜，勇敢地投入战斗，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批倒、批臭，彻底批判和肃清资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒，横扫一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界！
