Nearly a thousand West Berlin youth students held a demonstration on the 6th, strongly protesting against the visit of U.S. Vice President Humphrey to West Berlin.

Humphrey arrived in West Berlin on the 6th after touring several Western European countries to lobby for U.S. aggressive policies. The mayor of West Berlin hosted a reception for him that evening. Despite police attempts to block them, the demonstrators gathered at the entrance of the reception hall, booing and shouting, "Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Get out of Vietnam, you Yanks!" Some demonstrators angrily threw rotten eggs and flour at Humphrey.

The demonstrators held up signs reading, "No welcome for murderers Johnson and Humphrey!" "Johnson, think of Nuremberg!" "The U.S. is just like the SS, the gallows await you!"

When Humphrey took a car to another reception, he was met by over 500 young people demonstrating in the rain. The demonstrators waved the flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, singing the "Internationale." They booed at Humphrey and threw beer mugs at his car.

Due to Humphrey's repeated confrontations with local residents during his visits to several Western European countries, the U.S. occupation authorities and police in West Berlin were extremely anxious about the local people's protests against Humphrey. They suppressed the demonstrators, arresting several young people, while also taking what were considered "the strictest security measures" because they "feared trouble." Western news agencies described the nervous Humphrey's activities in West Berlin, saying that on the streets of West Berlin, there was a police officer every twenty feet, security personnel with their hands on their gun handles, car doors ready to open at any moment; U.S. helicopters followed the car convoy, while police patrolled the underground roads beneath Humphrey's route. Even the bridges Humphrey had to cross were guarded by police boats. It was reported that Humphrey himself was so frightened that he did not dare to ride in a small car but preferred to ride in a "bus-like large vehicle."

New China News Agency, Bonn, April 6th: Three hundred West German youth and workers held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in West Germany on the 5th, protesting against U.S. Vice President Humphrey's conspiratorial activities in West Germany.

The demonstrators held up signs condemning U.S. aggression in Vietnam and shouted, "U.S. troops out of South Vietnam!" "Stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!"

The angry demonstrators burned an effigy of the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson in front of the U.S. Embassy and submitted a protest letter to the U.S. Embassy, demanding that the U.S. stop its aggression in Vietnam.

April 6th, nearly a thousand demonstrators in West Berlin held up signs reading, "Yanks, get out of Vietnam!" and drove away the pest—U.S. Vice President Humphrey.

### 汉弗莱到西柏林又挨臭鸡蛋  近千群众举行抗议示威高呼“美国佬滚出越南！”

    汉弗莱到西柏林又挨臭鸡蛋
    近千群众举行抗议示威高呼“美国佬滚出越南！”
    新华社七日讯　西柏林消息：近千名西柏林青年学生六日举行示威，强烈抗议美国副总统汉弗莱到西柏林进行活动。
    汉弗莱是到西德等几个西欧国家为美国的侵略政策进行游说后，六日到达西柏林的。西柏林市长当晚为他举行招待会，示威群众不顾警察的阻拦，在招待会大厅门口举行示威，他们不时发出嘘声并且高呼：“杀人犯！杀人犯！杀人犯！”“美国佬滚出越南！”一些示威群众还愤怒地向汉弗莱扔臭鸡蛋和洒面粉。
    示威群众高举着的标语牌上写着：“不欢迎杀人犯约翰逊和汉弗莱！”“约翰逊，想想纽伦堡（指二次世界大战后审判战犯的纽伦堡国际法庭）吧！”“美国同（希特勒）党卫军一样，绞架正在等着你们！”
    当汉弗莱乘车去参加另一个招待会时，又遭到五百多名青年冒雨举行的抗议示威。示威群众挥动越南民主共和国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，高唱《国际歌》。他们向汉弗莱发出一片嘘声，并且有人向他乘坐的汽车投扔啤酒杯。
    由于汉弗莱在几个西欧国家活动时，处处遭到当地居民的迎头痛击，犹如过街老鼠，所以西柏林美国占领军当局和警察当局对于当地群众反对汉弗莱的示威十分恐慌。他们一面对示威群众进行镇压，逮捕了好几名青年，一面又采取被认为是“最严密的保安措施”，因为“害怕发生麻烦”。西方通讯社在描述做贼心虚的汉弗莱在西柏林活动的情景说，在西柏林闹市，马路上每隔二十英尺就有一名警察，保安人员手按在枪柄上，把汽车门随时打开；美国直升飞机跟着车队飞行，而警察则在汉弗莱经过的道路下面的地下车道中巡逻。连汉弗莱要经过的桥梁下面也守着警察的小艇。据报道，汉弗莱本人，吓得连小轿车也不敢坐，而宁愿乘“象公共汽车那样的大车”。
    新华社波恩六日电  三百名西德青年和工人，五日在美国驻西德大使馆门前举行示威，抗议美国副总统汉弗莱到西德进行阴谋活动。
    示威群众高举谴责美国侵略越南的标语牌，并且高呼：“美国军队从南越撤出去！”“停止轰炸越南民主共和国！”
    愤怒的示威者在美国大使馆前焚烧了一个美帝国主义头子约翰逊的模拟人像，并且向美国大使馆递交了一份抗议书，要求美国停止侵略越南的战争。
