After the important article "Patriotism or Treason?" was published, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfanghong Production Brigade in Chengguan Town, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, held a meeting to denounce the shameless lies of the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

Exploitation Is Not "Saving" People but Eating Them

Peasant Shen Baorong angrily said: The top capitalist-roader in the Party says that "exploitation is saving people." This is completely the nonsense of landlords and rich peasants. When I was fifteen or sixteen, I worked for landlords, from the county to other places, and worked for more than thirty landlord families. Landlords are all wolves. One year, my mother fell ill, and a landlord said he would "take care of" me, giving me a mu of rented land to farm. I believed him and went to farm it. But in the autumn, he took all the rice. I worked for a year for nothing and still owed him a dou of rent. My mother died of anger at home. I worked for landlords for sixteen years, and apart from ruining my family, I got nothing. Landlords are the enemies of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The top capitalist-roader in the Party says that the exploitation of landlords and rich peasants of farmers is "saving people." This shows that he is also our enemy. We must overthrow him.

"Three Freedoms and One Contract" Is Harming the Majority for the Benefit of a Few

Peasant Wei Laixing said: The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates "three freedoms and one contract," which is a reactionary proposal to restore capitalism. If we follow his way, we poor and lower-middle peasants will return to the old days and suffer again. In 1963, our brigade was influenced by the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract," engaging in raising ducks, burning bricks, and contracting production to households. The clay bricks were contracted to a well-off peasant. This well-off peasant then hired workers, making several thousand yuan in a couple of years, building new houses and adding new furniture, becoming a "quick-rich" person. While another poor peasant household, the collective contracted more than a hundred ducks to him. Due to his weakness and various difficulties, he lost more than five hundred yuan in a couple of years, forcing him to sell his house and furniture. This is not an isolated case; many poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered this way. What is "three freedoms and one contract"? It is the road to restore capitalism; it is the road to death for the poor and lower-middle peasants; it is the road where a few get rich and the majority suffer. We poor and lower-middle peasants cannot walk this road in a thousand or ten thousand ways. We must block it!

"Four Freedoms" Are Four Chains

Peasant Shen Changshui said, Chairman Mao teaches us that organization is the only way from poverty to prosperity. Only by organizing can we resist disasters and change the face of poverty. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party goes against Chairman Mao's teachings, proposing the so-called "four freedoms," causing many poor and lower-middle peasants to suffer disasters. For example, in our brigade, there is a peasant named Ru Zaichun. His family of six has been influenced by "operational freedom" for many years, engaging in individual operations, resulting in "rotting fields and broken mortars," sinking deeper and deeper. Later, facts educated him, and he returned to the collective economy family. Our poor and lower-middle peasants' practice proves that the "four freedoms" are four chains for us. If we let the "four freedoms" spread, we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer again, and China will change color. We poor and lower-middle peasants absolutely do not agree.

Follow Chairman Mao Forever to Make Revolution

The poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the history since liberation. Countless facts prove that whenever the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao was implemented, the countryside would prosper; whenever it was influenced by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the countryside would be filled with evil winds. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the top capitalist-roader in the Party opposes the socialist system, the more the poor and lower-middle peasants must insist on the socialist system. At present, we must especially implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" without any discount, and use the surging enthusiasm released in the Cultural Revolution to spring production, and do a good job in this year's agricultural production. They also unanimously expressed that they would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

### 谁反对社会主义谁就是我们的死对头  绍兴城关镇东方红大队贫下中农举行座谈会

    谁反对社会主义谁就是我们的死对头
    绍兴城关镇东方红大队贫下中农举行座谈会
    新华社杭州七日电　《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章发表以后，浙江绍兴县城关镇东方红大队贫下中农社员开了座谈会，纷纷以自己的血泪史，痛斥党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的无耻谰言。
    剥削不是“救”人而是吃人
    社员盛包荣愤怒地说：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派说什么“剥削是救人”，这完全是地主、富农的鬼话。我十五六岁就给地主做工，从县里做到外地，先后给三十多家地主做过工。天下乌鸦一般黑，那里的地主都是吃人狼。有一年，我母亲生病，有一个地主说“照顾”我，给我一亩租田种种，我信以为真，就去种了。那知道，秋后他把稻谷全收了去。我白做一年，反欠他一斗租米。我母亲活活气死在家中。我给地主做了十六年苦工，除了弄得家破人亡之外，什么也没有。地主是贫下中农的死对头。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派把地主、富农对农民的剥削说成是“救人”，这说明他也是我们农民的死对头，我们一定要打倒他。
    “三自一包”是多数人受害少数人发财
    社员韦来兴说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“三自一包”，是复辟资本主义的反动主张。如果照他这样去办，我们贫下中农就要回到老路上去，再吃二遍苦。一九六三年，我们大队受“三自一包”这股邪气的影响，大搞养鸭、烧窑、包产到户的勾当。瓷砖的泥坯包给富裕农民。这个富裕农民就乘机雇工，两年多时间发了几千元横财，造新房，添新家具，成了“快发户”。而另一户贫农社员，集体把一百多只鸭包给他，由于他身单力薄和有其他种种困难，两年多时间就赔了五百多元，逼得他一时无法生活，只好卖屋卖家具。这决不是个别例子，不少贫下中农都吃过这个苦头。“三自一包”究竟是什么货色不是很清楚了吗？这条路是资本主义复辟的路；这条路是贫下中农的断头路；这条路是少数人发财、多数人受害的路。我们贫下中农一千个不能走，一万个不能走。我们坚决要把它堵死！
      “四大自由”是四条锁链
    社员沈长水说，毛主席教导我们，组织起来是由贫穷变富裕的必由之路，只有组织起来，才能顶住灾荒，改变贫困面貌。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却与毛主席的教导唱反调，抛出了所谓：“四大自由”的主张，使不少贫下中农遭了灾。譬如，我们队里有一个社员叫茹再春的，一家六口，过去一直受“经营自由”的影响，搞了多年个体经营，结果还是“烂田垒石臼”，越陷越深。后来，事实教育了他，他才回到集体经济的大家庭里来。我们贫下中农的实践证明，“四大自由”对我们贫下中农就是四条锁链。如果让“四大自由”泛滥，那我们贫下中农就要吃二遍苦，中国就要改变颜色。我们贫下中农绝对不答应。
      紧跟毛主席永远干革命
    贫下中农回忆了解放以来的历史，无数事实证明，凡是贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线时，农村就一片兴旺；当受到资产阶级反动路线的影响时，农村里就邪气上升。贫下中农说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派越是反对社会主义制度，贫下中农越是要坚持社会主义制度，在当前，特别要不折不扣地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把文化大革命中所激发出来的冲天干劲，用到春耕生产中去，搞好今年的农业生产。他们还一致表示：一定要听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想作武器，彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
