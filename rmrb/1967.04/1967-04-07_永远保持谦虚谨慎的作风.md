At a critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a decisive battle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and in the midst of the intense struggle to "grasp revolution and promote production," our great leader Chairman Mao has entrusted our military with the honorable tasks of supporting the left, aiding agriculture, and aiding industry. This is the greatest trust that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have placed in us, and it is also a heavy responsibility. In carrying out these tasks, our military has received the enthusiastic welcome, active support, and high trust of the broad revolutionary masses. In the current new situation, the heavier the tasks of our military, the higher the prestige among the people, the more we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, guard against arrogance and impatience, and always maintain a humble and cautious style.

Each of us must deeply understand that the broad masses of the people support and love our People's Liberation Army primarily because our great commander, Chairman Mao, enjoys unparalleled prestige. The people love and praise our army because this army is personally created and nurtured by Chairman Mao, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and is a great army that stands firmly with the people and serves the people wholeheartedly. All the achievements and victories of our army are won under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and are the victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Glory to the great leader Chairman Mao! Glory to the great people!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people." "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and self-satisfied." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our People's Liberation Army has made great contributions to the cause of the Party and the people. However, we must not be arrogant and self-satisfied. Every cadre and soldier must deeply realize that our tasks are heavy and the road is long. Every cadre and soldier must work diligently and conscientiously, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, guard against arrogance and impatience, and serve the people wholeheartedly. We must strive our utmost to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must resolutely and correctly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations for us, nor will we disappoint the broad masses of the people's expectations for us.

The most important aspect of maintaining a humble and cautious style is to correctly treat the masses, respectfully learn from the revolutionary masses, and enthusiastically learn from the revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao says: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

Believing in the masses is the essence of historical materialism and a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not one believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and lets the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, is an important indicator of whether one can implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The reason why our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great success is precisely because, under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, billions of people have been truly mobilized. The revolutionary masses have made immortal contributions in the Cultural Revolution and are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Without the mass movement, there would be no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must see that the masses possess immense revolutionary enthusiasm, boundless wisdom, and strength. We must rely on the masses, consult with the masses on every matter, and learn from the masses. We must not merely acknowledge in words that the masses are the real heroes, but in actual work, especially after achieving some success, only see our own role and overlook the role of the masses. We must not act in a domineering manner or be overbearing. Otherwise, we will become detached from the masses and will not truly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

First, be a student of the masses, then be a teacher of the masses. This is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching to us. We must have the spirit of being willing to be a small student of the masses and humbly listen to the opinions of the revolutionary masses. Toward young revolutionary pioneers and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, we must learn from their revolutionary spirit of rebellion, support them enthusiastically, respect them, and never act as if we are senior. Toward revolutionary cadres who are in contact with the masses, we must cooperate well with them, discuss problems with them humbly, and actively support them in their work. Toward revolutionary masses and young revolutionaries, we must see their revolutionary direction, learn from their advantages and strengths humbly. If they make some mistakes, we must see their essence and mainstream, and help them wholeheartedly and patiently.

To maintain humility and caution, we must seriously study and correctly understand the Party's policies, and strictly act in accordance with the Party's policies. When encountering problems, we must conduct thorough and detailed investigations, conduct class analysis seriously, and never be careless. We must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, be good at identifying genuine revolutionary leftists, and correctly treat cadres. We must not be self-righteous or subjective.

To maintain a humble and cautious style, we must frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism. Because we are facing sharp and complex class struggles, we will encounter many new problems that we have never encountered before, and we lack experience, so it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes in our work. This requires us to strictly demand of ourselves, prevent and overcome self-satisfaction, and constantly check ourselves. If we have any mistakes, we must correct them immediately. We must welcome criticism from the revolutionary masses with the attitude of "hearing criticism is a joy" and "the speaker is without fault, the listener is warned." As long as we constantly summarize our experiences and lessons, persist in what is good for the people and correct what is wrong for the people, we will definitely be able to complete our tasks perfectly with the enthusiastic help of the broad revolutionary masses.

Comrade Lin Biao points out: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." Supporting the left, aiding agriculture, and aiding industry are a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and are the most vivid and practical class education on class struggle. Each of us must, while transforming the objective world, strive to transform our subjective world, and gain new tempering and improvement in the struggle. We must, in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Articles" as our motto, break down the "self" and establish the "public." Only in this way can we prevent arrogance and self-satisfaction and maintain a humble and cautious style.

The humble and cautious style is determined by the class nature of our proletarian revolutionary army and is a glorious tradition of our army. We must always maintain and carry forward this glorious tradition and better serve the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Humility promotes progress, arrogance leads to backwardness." In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our army's new tasks, we must especially remember this great truth.

    永远保持谦虚谨慎的作风
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，在“抓革命，促生产”的紧张战斗中，我们伟大领袖毛主席交给我军支持左派、支援农业、支援工业等光荣任务。这是毛主席和党中央对我们的最大信任，也是交给我们的重大担子。我军在执行任务中，得到了广大革命群众热情的欢迎、积极的支持和高度的信赖。在当前新的形势下，我军的任务越重，在人民群众中的威望越高，就越要牢记毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，永远保持谦虚谨慎的作风。
    我们每一个同志都要深刻认识到，广大人民群众如此拥护和热爱我们人民解放军，首先是因为我们伟大的统帅毛主席享有无比崇高的威望。人民群众爱戴和赞扬我军，是因为我们这支军队，是毛主席亲自缔造和培育的，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大军队，是因为我们这支军队，是在毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅直接领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治的真正革命化的军队，是因为我们这支军队是紧紧地和人民群众站在一起，全心全意为人民服务的人民子弟兵。我军的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。光荣归于伟大的领袖毛主席！光荣归于伟大的人民！
    毛主席教导说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”在毛泽东思想指引下，我们人民解放军为党和人民的事业作出了伟大贡献。但是我们绝不能骄傲自满。每个干部战士，要深深认识到我们任重而道远。每个干部战士要更加兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，活学活用毛主席著作，要戒骄戒躁，全心全意为人民服务，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底作出最大的努力。我们要坚决地正确地执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们绝不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对我们的期望，绝不辜负广大人民群众对我们的期望。
    保持谦虚谨慎的作风，最重要的就是要正确对待群众，恭恭敬敬地向革命群众请教，满腔热情地向革命群众学习。
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”。
    相信群众，这是历史唯物主义的精髓，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一个根本原理。是不是相信群众，依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，这是能不能执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。我国轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，所以取得伟大成就，正是由于在毛主席的亲自领导下，把亿万群众真正发动起来了。革命群众在文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋，是无产阶级文化大革命的主人。没有群众运动，就没有无产阶级文化大革命。我们要看到群众中蕴蓄着巨大的革命积极性，蕴蓄着无穷无尽的智慧和力量。我们一定要依靠群众，遇事同群众商量，拜群众为师。绝不能仅仅在口头上承认群众是真正的英雄，而在实际工作中，特别是在做出了一定成绩的时候，却只看到自己的作用，看不到群众的作用。绝不能包办代替，指手划脚。否则，就会脱离群众，就不能真正贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生。这是毛主席对我们一贯的教导。我们要有甘当群众的小学生的精神，虚心听取革命群众的意见。对年青的革命闯将，对革命群众组织的负责人，要学习他们的革命造反精神，热情地支持他们，尊重他们，绝不可以摆老资格。对联系群众的革命干部，要很好地和他们合作，虚心地和他们商量问题，积极支持他们做好工作。对革命群众、革命小将，必须看到他们的革命的大方向，虚心学习他们的优点和长处，如果他们发生了某些缺点错误，也要看到他们的本质和主流，满腔热情地、耐心地帮助他们。
    要做到谦虚谨慎，就要认真学习，正确领会党的方针政策，严格按照党的政策办事。遇到问题，要作深入细致的调查研究，认真进行阶级分析，万万不可粗心大意。要严格区分两类矛盾，善于识别真正的革命左派，正确对待干部。切不可自以为是，主观臆断。
    要保持谦虚谨慎的作风，就要经常开展批评和自我批评。由于我们面临的是尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，将会遇到许许多多从来没有碰到过的新问题，而我们又缺乏经验，在工作中难免产生某些缺点错误。这就需要严格要求自己，防止和克服自满情绪，时时检查，有了缺点错误就要立即改正。要以“闻过则喜”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”的态度，欢迎来自革命群众的批评。只要我们不断总结经验教训，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们就一定能够在广大革命群众的热情帮助下，圆满地完成我们所担负的任务。
    林彪同志指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”支持左派、支援农业、支援工业，是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，是最生动最实际的阶级教育课。我们每一个同志都要在改造客观世界的同时，努力改造自己的主观世界，在斗争中得到新的锻炼和提高。我们要在斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”，当作座右铭，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。这样才能防止骄傲自满，保持谦虚谨慎的作风。
    谦虚谨慎的作风，是我们无产阶级革命军队的阶级本质所决定的，是我军的光荣传统。我们一定要永远保持和发扬这一光荣传统，更好地为人民服务。毛主席教导我们说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新形势和我军执行新任务中，我们要特别记住这个伟大真理。
                                          （四月六日）
