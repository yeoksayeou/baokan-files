The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have exposed the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the head of the revisionists. This is a great victory for the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely and actively enter the battle!

Great Leader Chairman Mao is the radiant red sun in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. For generations, we have suffered exploitation and oppression, but it is Chairman Mao and the Party who helped us achieve thorough liberation. Our lives get better day by day, and our political consciousness grows higher day by day. Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the mountains and wider than the seas. However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party tries every means to oppose and resist great Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to drag our country onto the capitalist road. We will not allow this!

I remember that during the period when our country faced temporary economic difficulties, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within our commune, under the encouragement of their head's "three freedoms and one contract," tried to drag us back from the collective path. They proposed:

"Small production teams are best, with three to five households per team, which is convenient for production and promotes initiative." Convenient for what kind of "production"? Promotes what kind of "initiative"? In reality, it is convenient for capitalist production and promotes the initiative to develop capitalism. They also emphasized management, saying, "If management is not good, one cannot be a good cadre," which in reality is to abolish political and ideological work, to abolish class struggle.

During the Cultural Revolution, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party brought out the so-called experience fabricated by Wang Xixian in "Taoyuan," indiscriminately attacking and excluding cadres, whether they are proletarian authorities or bourgeois authorities, appearing left but actually right, opposing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Here, those with ulterior motives, according to the logic of the bourgeois reactionary line, put many hats on cadres, dug out "black lines," and carried out ruthless struggles and merciless attacks. They blocked the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee from above and isolated revolutionary cadres and the broad masses from below; they spread cold winds and ignited evil fires, allowing cadres who were removed during the Four Clean-ups and ghosts and snakes to take the opportunity to stir up trouble and carry out class revenge. We poor and lower-middle peasants, through resolute struggles, quickly exposed the ugly faces of the class enemies. We poor and lower-middle peasants must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the tiger is so terrible, but in reality, he has nothing in his mouth." We will resolutely criticize and repudiate the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party politically and ideologically!

The Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary movement personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. In this magnificent revolutionary movement, we broad poor and lower-middle peasants continuously arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, distinguish right from wrong, and identify friends and enemies. While seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, we seize the power of the "self" in our minds. Through this struggle, we deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon to defeat the enemy, and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of revolution and production. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolve to better grasp this powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    我们贫下中农决心勇敢地投入战斗
    北京市贫下中农代表会议常委  罗瑞华
    无产阶级文化大革命的烈火熊熊燃烧，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、修正主义的总头目被挖出来了。这是毛主席为代表的革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！我们贫下中农坚决高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，勇敢积极地投入战斗！
    伟大的领袖毛主席是我们贫下中农心中光芒四射的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子。我们世世代代受尽剥削和压迫，就是毛主席和党帮助我们得到彻底解放。我们的日子一天比一天好，我们的政治觉悟一天比一天高。毛主席的恩情真比山还高，比海还深。但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计反对和抵制伟大的毛泽东思想，妄想把我们国家拉到资本主义道路上去，我们决不答应！
    记得在我们国家遭受暂时经济困难时期，我们公社党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在他们的总头目所喊的“三自一包”的鼓励下，力图把我们从集体化的道路拖向后退。他们提出：
  “生产队越小越好，三五户一队最好，便利生产，促进积极性。”到底便利什么样的“生产”？促进什么样的“积极性”？实际上便利的是资本主义的生产，促进的是发展资本主义的积极性。他们还大讲特讲经营管理，说什么“经营管理搞不好，就不能当好干部”，这实际上是取消政治思想工作，取消阶级斗争。
    在文化大革命中，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把王××在“桃园”炮制的所谓经验又搬了出来，对干部不分是无产阶级当权派还是资产阶级当权派，一律打倒，统统排斥，形“左”而实右，与毛主席的干部政策相对抗。在我们这里，那些别有用心的人按照资产阶级反动路线的逻辑，在干部中大扣帽子，大挖“黑线”，进行残酷斗争，无情打击。他们对上封锁毛主席、党中央的声音，对下把革命干部和广大群众隔离开来；他们刮阴风，点邪火，让四清运动中下台的干部和牛鬼蛇神，趁机兴风作浪，进行阶级报复。我们贫下中农经过坚决的斗争，很快揭穿了阶级敌人的丑恶面目。我们贫下中农一定要牢记毛主席这一教导：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”坚决把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派从政治上思想上批倒斗臭！
    文化大革命，是毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大革命运动。在这次轰轰烈烈的革命运动中，我们广大贫下中农不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑，明辨是非，分清敌友，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，夺取自己头脑中私字的权。通过这次斗争，我们深深体会到：毛泽东思想是战胜敌人最有力的武器，毛泽东思想是革命和生产取得胜利的根本保证。我们贫下中农决心更好地掌握毛泽东思想这一强大的批判武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
