Our great leader Chairman Mao decided to broadcast the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism nationwide, personally igniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Kang Yaming, and the entire school presented a great revolutionary situation. Under these circumstances, as members of the People's Liberation Army of China, under the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, we, as members of the work team led by a responsible person from the Provincial Party Committee, participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Nanjing University.

From the day after we entered the school, there were principled differences within the work team. As the movement deepened, the differences became greater, and the struggle became more intense. When we realized that this was a struggle between two lines, we consciously and resolutely stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, openly and firmly supporting the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, fighting side by side with them, and winning the victory of the struggle.

I

In late June last year, the revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University broke through the framework set by the Provincial Party Committee to restrict the mass movement, posting a batch of revolutionary big-character posters, exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of some people within the school party committee. This caused a "big trouble." A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and the school party committee incited some deceived students to attack the revolutionary big-character posters and used the tools of dictatorship to frame these revolutionary comrades, labeling them as "counter-revolutionaries," "bad elements," and so on.

Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution. ... Our revolution must have the assurance of not taking the wrong path and of being certain to succeed. We must pay attention to uniting our true friends to attack our true enemies." The revolutionary students of Nanjing University, many of whom come from worker and poor peasant families, dared to think, speak, act, and make revolution. Their big-character posters presented facts and reasoned logically, in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. They had no crimes, so how could they be treated as enemies? Out of strong proletarian feelings, we liked them from the bottom of our hearts, sympathized with them, and supported their revolutionary actions. We resisted and opposed the plot of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party to frame revolutionary comrades.

These revolutionary youngsters, under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, thought of Chairman Mao day and night. They had unlimited trust in the People's Liberation Army of China, which was personally created by Chairman Mao and directly led by Comrade Lin Biao. They found us. We supported them, encouraged their revolutionary spirit, and told them: "Your big-character posters are well-written, courageous, and have a high level. You must persist to the end."

Just as the broad revolutionary teachers and students stood up to expose the problems of the school party committee, the Provincial Party Committee proposed the policy of "striking from the middle and lower levels," attempting to shift the direction of the struggle and direct the spearhead towards the broad cadres and masses. We disagreed with this and fought against it in various ways. After the main responsible person of the work team announced at a mass meeting that "the school party committee is correct," students rushed to ask us: "Can the school party committee be criticized?" We firmly replied: "It must be criticized. Anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be exposed and criticized."

Our revolutionary actions aroused the extreme hatred of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee. They repeatedly pressured us, saying things like "someone is using the banner of the PLA to oppose the Provincial Party Committee," "opposing the Provincial Party Committee is opposing the party," "one wrong step and your head will roll," and so on. We are revolutionary soldiers, acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, which is our duty. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we resolutely carry out; whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we resolutely resist. Under the high-pressure policy of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, our belief in supporting the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat remained unshaken.

II

The publication of the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sounded the death knell for the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat at Nanjing University were elated and launched a fierce attack on the erroneous line executed by the work team, firing the first shot in Nanjing to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat saw problems sharply. In criticizing the errors of the work team, they discovered that the root of the problem lay within the Provincial Party Committee. They fought fiercely, determined to expose the class struggle within the Provincial Party Committee. The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat trusted us and hoped that we would rise up to rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line. At this time, our situation was very difficult, and our feelings were very complicated. On the one hand, the revolutionary teachers and students spoke with reason, and the work team had indeed made errors in direction and line. We should clearly support them; on the other hand, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line, using the so-called "discipline" to suppress us, stipulating "internal differences, external unity, clear to superiors, not to subordinates, obey the organization, reserve opinions," and repeatedly asking us to "unify our statements." Under these circumstances, what should we do?

Chairman Mao taught us: "A Communist Party member should be frank, sincere, active, and regard revolutionary interests as his first life." Chairman Mao also said: "The people's army is not for the interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the whole nation, to unite and fight. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." We are Communist Party members and honorable members of the People's Liberation Army of China. We must not be afraid, forget national affairs, or obey the discipline of revisionism. We must not maintain erroneous leadership. We have followed Chairman Mao in making revolution for half our lives and must maintain our proletarian revolutionary integrity. We must resolutely fight against anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned! We decided to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly rebel against a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, and rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line.

Thus, we stood up and openly supported the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." We closely connected with the revolutionary masses, shared their breath, shared their fate, fought together, and won together. We exposed the crimes of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our exposure further strengthened the revolutionary rebels' confidence in struggle. From then on, the revolutionary rebels trusted us even more, and we established a deep combat friendship with them.

The revolutionary youngsters educated and helped us. The revolutionary youngsters are the new forces nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the revolutionary direction. We deeply felt that to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well, we must closely follow Mao Zedong Thought and follow the revolutionary youngsters.

Chairman Mao said: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves. They either fabricate lies out of nothing; or seize on some superficial phenomena to attack the essence of things; or flatter a part of the people to attack another part; or take advantage of an opportunity to 'break through some gaps,' putting us in a difficult position. In short, they are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' seeking to succeed."

The situation was exactly like this. Because we openly supported the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party regarded us as thorns in their eyes and daggers in their hearts, determined to eliminate us. They went to great lengths to spread rumors and slander, creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion, shifting the direction of the struggle, and directing the spearhead towards the revolutionary rebels who adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and towards the great People's Liberation Army of China. They incited the "conservative" organizations to attack us day and night, struggle against us, and even did not let go of the comrade who was undergoing surgery in the hospital. They maliciously slandered us as "scum of the PLA" and "traitors of the Communist Party," and searched for our materials everywhere, preparing to hold a meeting of ten thousand people to announce us as "anti-party elements." For a time, there was truly a sense of "black clouds pressing down on the city, ready to collapse."

In the midst of the brutal counter-revolutionary attacks, we had only one belief: to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death and resolutely follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. We believed that there is only one truth, which is Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how great the resistance or how heavy the blows, they are only temporary. Mao Zedong Thought must prevail.

At that time, many revolutionary masses came to the hospital to visit us and encouraged us to fight resolutely. We told the revolutionary youngsters that this was a class struggle, and class struggle requires a price to be paid. We were prepared for sacrifice, and even if we were sacrificed, it would be worthwhile.

Some people with ulterior motives threatened us: "You are inciting the masses to fight the masses." This is nonsense. We openly stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, hoping that the deceived masses would return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and jointly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Our actions were open and above board. Those who adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line supported the conservatives and attacked the revolutionaries, which was the real incitement of the masses to fight the masses.

Some well-meaning people advised us not to support one side and exclude the other, but to unite the forces of both sides. Can this be done? No. Things are divided into two aspects. In the fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, two classes, and two lines, not siding with the revolutionaries means siding with the conservatives, not siding with the proletariat means siding with the bourgeoisie. Being impartial and just is impossible. So-called neutrality is hypocritical.

Regardless of the threats of people with ulterior motives or the advice of well-meaning people, we resolutely held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and supported the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. The more thoroughly we exposed, the more resolutely we fought, the more powerful our support for them became.

III

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat had great initiative and fought resolutely, and their general direction was always correct. In this great revolutionary movement, it was inevitable that they would have this or that shortcoming and error. Some people with ulterior motives, not looking at the essence and mainstream of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, seized on some of their shortcomings and errors in their advance, made a big fuss, and created public opinion to attack the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, attempting to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under these circumstances, we stood up and resolutely refuted the slander and attacks on the revolutionary youngsters. At the same time, we helped them in various ways, giving advice and support to the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat.

For the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, support them in every way, but the most important thing is to support them with Mao Zedong Thought. We ourselves studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought and helped the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat to use Mao Zedong Thought, so that they could become politically mature more quickly.

We particularly helped the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat to solve the following problems:

First, grasp the main contradiction, grasp the direction of the struggle, and direct the spearhead at a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. We suggested to the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat that they take Nanjing University as a "breakthrough point." Nanjing University was a stronghold where some people within the Provincial Party Committee implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and a "test field" where a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee tried to extinguish the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. By seizing this "breakthrough point," we could seriously strike at a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee.

Second, grasp the strategy of struggle and pay attention to uniting the majority. Chairman Mao said: "Revolution must adopt the strategy of developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing diehard forces. These are three inseparable links." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we repeatedly reminded the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat that they should take the lead but not detach themselves from the masses. They should correctly treat the masses in the conservative organizations who were deceived, regard them as their class brothers, not discriminate against them or exclude them; they should enthusiastically help them and patiently educate them, so that they could draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. As for the leaders of the conservative organizations who had close ties with a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line, they should mobilize the masses to fully expose and criticize them. Only in this way could they boost the morale of the proletariat, suppress the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and continuously strengthen the leftist forces.

Third, strengthen propaganda work and vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, fully exposing the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Every time a major revolutionary action was taken, propaganda work was treated as the most important thing, so that the broad masses could understand the truth and more people could participate in exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line.

Fourth, correctly handle the contradictions within the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. Through rectification, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome differences, strengthen unity, and act in unison to fight the enemy.

In the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we formed a life-and-death combat friendship with the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. We are determined to always fight with them, learn from each other, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我们是怎样支持无产阶级革命派的
    梁辑卿　杜方平　吴大胜
    我们伟大领袖毛主席决定广播全国第一张马列主义大字报，亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。南京大学的革命师生，在毛泽东思想的指引下，揪出了反革命修正主义分子匡亚明，全校呈现出一片大好的革命形势。在这种情况下，我们作为中国人民解放军的一员，在江苏省委的组织下，作为由省委一个负责人率领的工作队的成员，参加了南京大学的无产阶级文化大革命。
    从我们进校的第二天起，工作队内部就存在着原则的分歧。随着运动的深入发展，分歧越来越大，斗争越来越激烈。当我们认识到这是两条路线斗争的时候，我们就自觉地、坚决地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，公开地、坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，同他们并肩战斗，赢得了斗争的胜利。
    一
    去年六月下旬，南京大学的革命师生，冲破了省委制定的束缚群众运动的框框，贴出了一批革命的大字报，揭露校党委内一些人的反革命修正主义罪行。这下子闯了“大祸”。省委内和校党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，策动一些受蒙蔽的学生，对革命的大字报进行围攻，并且运用专政工具，准备陷害这些革命同志，把他们打成“反革命分子”、“坏分子”等等。
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”南京大学的革命学生，许多人出身于工人和贫下中农家庭。他们敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命，贴的大字报摆事实、讲道理，符合毛泽东思想。他们没有罪，怎么可以把他们当作敌人呢？我们出于强烈的无产阶级感情，从心底里喜欢他们，同情他们，支持他们的革命行动。我们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派企图陷害革命同志的阴谋，进行了抵制和反对。
    这些革命小将，在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，日夜想念毛主席。他们对毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接领导的中国人民解放军，无限信任。他们找到了我们。我们支持他们，鼓励他们的革命精神，对他们说：“你们的大字报写得好，有勇气，有水平，要坚持到底。”
    就在广大革命师生起来揭发校党委问题的时候，省委提出了“从中下层开刀”的方针，妄图转移斗争的大方向，把矛头指向广大干部和群众。我们不同意这样做，通过各种方式，进行了斗争。当工作队的主要负责人在群众大会上宣布“校党委是正确的”以后，学生纷纷跑来问我们：“校党委能不能批判？”我们坚定地回答：“一定要批判。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的东西，都应该揭露，应该批判。”
    我们的革命行动，引起了省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的极端仇视。他们一而再、再而三地向我们施加压力，说什么“有人打着解放军的大旗反省委”，“反省委就是反党”，“错走一步，人头落地”等等。我们是革命军人，按照毛泽东思想办事，是我们义不容辞的天职。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决照办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决抵制。在省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的高压政策下，我们支持无产阶级革命派的信念，始终没有动摇。
    二
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定的公布，敲响了资产阶级反动路线的丧钟。南京大学无产阶级革命派欢欣鼓舞，向工作队执行的错误路线展开猛烈进攻，打响了南京批判资产阶级反动路线的第一炮。
    无产阶级革命派看问题很尖锐，他们在批判工作队的错误时，发现根子在省委内部。他们猛打猛冲，决心揭开省委内阶级斗争的盖子。无产阶级革命派信任我们，希望我们起来造资产阶级反动路线的反。这时，我们的处境很困难，心情很复杂。一方面，革命师生讲的句句有道理，工作队确实犯了方向错误、路线错误，我们应该明确地支持他们；另一方面，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，用所谓“纪律”的大棒压制我们，规定“对内分歧，对外统一，对上言明，对下不谈，服从组织，保留意见”，并多次要我们同他们“统一口径”。在这种情况下，我们应该怎么办？
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命”。毛主席又说：人民的军队“不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们是共产党员，是光荣的中国人民解放军的一员，绝不能“怕”字当头，忘记国家大事，绝不能遵守修正主义的“纪律”，绝不能维护错误的领导。我们跟着毛主席闹了半辈子革命，要保持无产阶级革命的晚节。我们要坚决同不符合毛泽东思想的东西作不调和的斗争。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！我们决心站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的立场上，彻底造省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反。
    于是，我们就站出来，旗帜鲜明地支持无产阶级革命派。我们遵循毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，同革命群众密切联系，同呼吸，共命运，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们揭发了省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在无产阶级文化大革命中的罪行。我们的揭发，更加坚定了无产阶级革命派斗争的信心。从此，无产阶级革命派就更加信任我们，我们同他们建立了深厚的战斗友谊。
    革命的小将教育了我们，帮助了我们。革命的小将是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量，他们体现了革命的大方向。我们深深体会到，要把无产阶级文化大革命搞好，就要紧跟毛泽东思想，紧追革命小将。
    毛主席说：各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。或者无中生有，当面造谣；或者抓住若干表面现象，攻击事情的本质；或者吹捧一部分人，攻击一部分人；或者借题发挥，“冲破一些缺口”，使我们处于困难地位。总之，他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，“窥测方向”，以求一逞。
    事情正是这样。由于我们公开支持无产阶级革命派，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把我们视为眼中钉，肉中刺，必除之而后快。他们极尽造谣中伤、诬蔑攻击之能事，大造反革命舆论，转移斗争大方向，把矛头指向坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命派，指向伟大的中国人民解放军。他们策动保字号组织，日夜围攻我们，斗争我们，甚至对在医院里做外科手术的同志也不放过。他们恶毒诬蔑我们是
  “解放军的败类”、“共产党的叛徒”，并四出搜集我们的材料，准备召开十万人的大会，宣布我们为“反党分子”。一时之间，真有“黑云压城城欲摧”之势。
    在反革命的残酷围攻中，我们只有一个信念，就是誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决跟着毛主席闹革命。我们相信，真理只有一个，就是毛泽东思想。阻力再大，打击再重，总是暂时。毛泽东思想一定要胜利。
    当时，很多革命群众到医院来慰问我们，鼓励我们坚决战斗。我们告诉革命小将，这是阶级斗争，阶级斗争是要付出代价的。我们作好牺牲的准备，即使牺牲了，也是值得的。
    一些别有用心的人威胁我们：“你们挑动群众斗群众。”这是胡说。我们公开站在无产阶级革命派一边，希望受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，共同保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们的行动是光明磊落的。那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，支持保守派，打击革命派，这才是挑动群众斗群众。
    一些好心肠的人劝告我们，不要支持一派，排斥一派，要把两方面的力量团结起来。这样做行吗？不行。事物是一分为二的。在无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中，不偏革命派，就偏保守派，不偏无产阶级一边，就偏资产阶级一边。不偏不倚，公公正正，是不可能的。所谓中立，是虚伪的。
    不管别有用心的人的威胁，也不听好心人的劝告，我们坚决高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，支持无产阶级革命派。我们揭发越彻底，斗争越坚决，对他们支持就也越有力。
    三
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派闯劲很大，斗争很坚决，大方向始终是正确的。在这个伟大的革命运动中，他们产生这样那样的缺点和错误是难免的。一些别有用心的人，不看无产阶级革命派的本质和主流，抓住他们前进中的一些缺点和错误，大做文章，拚命制造舆论，打击无产阶级革命派，妄图达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。
    在这种情况下，我们挺身而出，坚决地驳斥了对革命小将的诬蔑和攻击。同时，我们从多方面为他们出主意，想办法，支持和帮助无产阶级革命派。
    对无产阶级革命派，千支持，万支持，最重要的是用毛泽东思想来支持。我们自己活学活用毛泽东思想，并帮助无产阶级革命派运用毛泽东思想，使他们在政治上更快地成熟起来。
    我们着重帮助无产阶级革命派解决了以下几个问题：
    第一，抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们向无产阶级革命派建议，以南京大学作为“突破口”。南京大学是省委内一些人推行资产阶级反动路线的顽固堡垒，是省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派扑灭无产阶级文化大革命烈火的“试验田”。抓住这个“突破口”，就可以严重打击省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    第二，掌握斗争策略，注意团结大多数。毛主席说：革命“必须采取发展进步势力、争取中间势力、反对顽固势力的策略，这是不可分离的三个环节”。根据毛主席的教导，我们反复地提醒无产阶级革命派，自己要走在前头，但不要脱离群众。要正确地对待保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，把他们看作是自己的阶级兄弟，不要歧视他们，排斥他们；要热情地帮助他们，耐心地教育他们，使他们同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。对于那些同省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派有密切联系的、坚持资产阶级反动路线的保守组织的头头，则发动群众进行充分的揭露和批判。只有这样，才能长无产阶级的志气，灭资产阶级的威风，不断壮大左派队伍。
    第三，加强宣传工作，大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，充分揭露资产阶级反动路线的罪恶。在每一次采取重大革命行动的时候，都把宣传工作当作头等重要的事情来对待，使广大群众了解事情的真相，争取更多的群众参加对资产阶级反动路线的揭露和批判。
    第四，正确处理无产阶级革命派内部的矛盾。通过整风，在毛泽东思想的基础上，克服分歧，加强团结，步调一致，共同对敌。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们同无产阶级革命派结成了生死与共的战斗友谊。我们决心永远同他们战斗在一起，互相学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。
