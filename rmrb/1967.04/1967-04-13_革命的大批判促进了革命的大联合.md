The revolutionary students of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School direct their struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party

Revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary unity. All the Red Guards in the school have achieved unity from the bottom up based on teaching classes. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, launch a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, thoroughly criticizing the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

According to a report by the Shanghai *Wen Hui Bao* on April 9, as the people of the entire country brandish the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and raise the banner of revolutionary criticism to launch a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the revolutionary Red Guards of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School have united in the common struggle of denouncing, exposing, and criticizing the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. All the Red Guards in the school have achieved unity from the bottom up based on teaching classes, and the Shanghai Sixth Girls' School Red Guards Corps has been established.

Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, two relatively large revolutionary Red Guard organizations, the "Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought" and the "August 18th Combat Team of the Shanghai Red Guards Headquarters," have been established in this school. Although these two organizations have always been in agreement on the general direction in their fierce struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, due to the stubborn implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, contradictions have been created among the students. They have used a portion of the deceived students to attack another portion of revolutionary students, inciting people to fight people. They have also used the reactionary theory of bloodline to create contradictions among the students, forming a situation where revolutionary students and conservative students from exploitative class families are opposed to each other. Some students deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line did not direct their spears at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but at their revolutionary classmates; the revolutionary students did not timely expose the plot of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to incite people to fight people, and did not unite with the conservative students from exploitative class families to fight together. The estrangement and opposition caused by the bourgeois reactionary line among the students have not been eliminated for a long time.

After Mao Zedong's latest instruction to resume classes and make revolution was issued, the broad Red Guard fighters responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call to "return to the classroom" and achieve school-wide unity based on teaching classes. However, because the bourgeois reactionary line has not been thoroughly criticized, although many students have returned to their classes, revolutionary students and those deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line sit in the same classroom but occupy different sides, study separately, and do not communicate with each other.

After the important article "Patriotism or Treachery?" by Comrade Chen Boda was published, the revolutionary Red Guards and students of this school held large and small meetings and demonstrations, launching a fierce attack on the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and carrying out a revolutionary criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line he proposed and the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" he concocted. Through the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, the unity of this school has been greatly promoted. Originally, the revolutionary students and those who had participated in conservative organizations in Class 2, Grade 2 did not concede to each other. At the "Denunciation and Exposure of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" meeting held on April 4, those who had participated in conservative organizations angrily denounced the harm caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. When they mentioned distributing leaflets with their spears pointed at the revolutionary students under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, they said painfully that at that time they thought they were following Chairman Mao's instructions and following the Party, but in fact, their spears were pointed at their class sisters. At this moment, the entire class was indignant, and everyone shouted in unison: "Down with the top capitalist-roader in the Party!" The revolutionary students said, they were also poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line! When the revolutionary students talked about defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the days when the school was under white terror, they often looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," day and night printing revolutionary leaflets, the students who had participated in conservative organizations were deeply moved. They said, if it were not for the revolutionary students, how could the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party be exposed! This is the immortal merit of the revolutionary students! Through this meeting, the students in this class gradually eliminated the estrangement and opposition caused by the bourgeois reactionary line and began to unite politically and ideologically, directing their spears at the top capitalist-roader in the Party. Other classes in this school, after studying "Patriotism or Treachery?" and other related articles, also realized that criticism is the current direction, and the proletarian revolutionary forces must unite immediately to fight the enemy together. They said, the top capitalist-roader in the Party hopes that we will split and fight "internal wars," so that they can sit back and watch. We must not fall for their tricks and must unite to launch a general offensive against this Khrushchev of China. On this basis, the school achieved unity from the bottom up, and the Shanghai Sixth Girls' School Red Guards Corps was born in the criticism movement.

The day before yesterday, the school's Red Guards Corps held an inaugural meeting. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, verbally and in writing, to launch a high tide of mass criticism, to pull down the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and to thoroughly criticize the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," which is an anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought concoction of the reactionary revisionist mastermind, politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

### 革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合

    上海第六女中革命小将把斗争矛头对准党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合
    全校红卫兵实现以教学班为基础自下而上革命的大联合。她们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，和广大革命师生一起，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击，把大毒草《修养》，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批深批透。
    本报讯　据上海《文汇报》四月九日报道：正当全国人民奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，高举革命的批判旗帜，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的时候，上海市第六女中的革命红卫兵在控诉、揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行的共同斗争中联合起来了。全校红卫兵实现了以教学班为基础自下而上革命的大联合，成立了上海市第六女中红卫兵团。
    这个学校从文化大革命以来，建立了两个比较大的革命派红卫兵组织“毛泽东思想红卫兵”和“红卫兵上海司令部‘八·一八’战斗队”。这两个组织在同资产阶级反动路线的激烈斗争中，大方向始终是一致的。但是，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，在学生中间制造矛盾，利用一部分受蒙蔽的学生去攻击另一部分革命派同学，挑动群众斗群众；又利用剥削阶级的反动血统论，在学生中间制造矛盾，形成革命派学生与保守的和出身剥削阶级家庭的学生之间互相对立。一些被资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的学生不是把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，而是指向革命派同学；革命派学生，没有及时识破党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动群众斗群众的阴谋，对于保守的和出身剥削阶级家庭的学生，不是团结她们共同作战。资产阶级反动路线在学生中间造成的隔阂和对立，在很长一段时间内没有得到消除。
    毛主席关于复课闹革命的最新指示下达后，广大红卫兵战士纷纷响应毛主席伟大号召，“杀”回班级去，实行以教学班为基础的全校大联合。但是，由于资产阶级反动路线没有得到彻底批判，许多学生虽然回到了班级，革命派学生和受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的学生之间，坐在一个教室里，却各占一方，各自学习，互不理睬。
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的重要文章发表后，这个学校的革命红卫兵和同学一起，举行大小会议、示威游行，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起猛烈的攻击，对他所提出的资产阶级反动路线，对他所炮制的大毒草《修养》展开革命的大批判。通过对资产阶级反动路线的大批判，大大促进了这个学校的大联合。高二（2）班的革命派和参加过保守组织的同学之间，原来互不服气。在四月四日召开的“控诉和揭发资产阶级反动路线”大会上，参加过保守组织的同学，愤怒地控诉了资产阶级反动路线对她们的毒害。当她们谈到在资产阶级反动路线影响下，散发了矛头对准革命派的传单时，沉痛地说，当时我们矛头指向阶级姐妹，却还以为是听毛主席的话，跟党走。这时，全班同学群情激愤，一致高呼：
  “打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”革命派的同学说，原来她们也是受资产阶级反动路线毒害的呀！而当革命派的同学在会上谈到，在学校处于白色恐怖的日子里，她们为了捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，不时望着毛主席像，高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，夜以继日赶印革命传单时，参加过保守组织的同学听了十分感动，她们说，如果没有革命派，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派怎么能揪得出来！这是革命派的不朽功绩！通过这次大会，这个班级的同学逐步消除了资产阶级反动路线所造成的隔阂和对立，开始从政治上、思想上联合起来，把矛头指向了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。这个学校的其他班级，在学习了《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》和其他有关文章后，也认识到大批判就是当前的大方向，无产阶级革命派必须立即联合起来，共同对敌。她们说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派最希望我们闹分裂、打“内战”，他们好坐山观虎斗。我们千万不要上他们的当，要齐心合力，向这个中国的赫鲁晓夫发起总攻击。在这个基础上，这个学校实现了自下而上的大联合，上海市第六女中红卫兵团也在大批判运动中诞生了。
    前天，这个学校的红卫兵团举行了成立大会。她们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和广大革命师生一起，活学活用毛主席著作，口诛笔伐，掀起一个群众性的大批判运动的高潮，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拉下马，把这个反革命修正主义的总后台炮制的反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草《修养》，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批深、批透。
