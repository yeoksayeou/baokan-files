Albanian women are launching a movement to change old customs and promote revolutionary change. In Tirana, women warriors who are fighting for new things met with Comrade Enver Hoxha.

According to reports from local newspapers, on the 19th, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, met with some of the representatives attending the national meeting of women warriors fighting for new things.

Present at the meeting were Ramiz Alia, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, and Vito Kapo, Chairwoman of the Central Council of the Albanian Women's Union.

During the meeting, Comrade Hoxha had a very cordial and friendly conversation with the representatives. Comrade Hoxha praised their great struggle to promote new things in their work, to oppose backward customs and religious remnants that hinder the progress of women.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out to the representatives that while working hard, they should also study diligently, continuously improve their political, ideological, and cultural levels, so that women can play an even greater role in the socialist construction of the country.

According to reports from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, 460 women representatives from all over Albania held a national meeting in Tirana on the 19th to fight for new things.

Comrade Ramiz Alia, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, congratulated the meeting and spoke at the meeting.

Nefi Muftiu, Secretary of the Central Council of the National Women's Union, reported on current issues such as women's liberation. The representatives had a heated discussion on the report. Nefi Muftiu said that now, our people are fighting against everything that is incompatible with the new society, burying old customs. In this fierce struggle between socialist ideology and bourgeois ideology that has emerged in our country in a new form, the thorough liberation of women, the elevation of their dignity, and the smashing of the evil shackles that make women slaves of backward customs and medieval laws are one of the most important fronts.

She concluded by saying that fighting for new things means bravely spreading new customs and habits everywhere, bravely destroying the old things that are on the verge of collapse, and thus establishing the complete equality of women.

The meeting also adopted an appeal to all women in Albania, calling on every village, factory, and residential area to establish combat women's core organizations, mobilize more women to participate in productive labor, and jointly fight for the thorough liberation of women.

The appeal calls on women in newly established agricultural production cooperatives to quickly eliminate private ownership ideas, establish new communist morality, and work hard to consolidate and strengthen agricultural production cooperatives.

The appeal said, our struggle for the thorough liberation of women is a long and arduous one. It is a class struggle in the ideological realm. Let us contribute our strength in the further deepening of the ideological and cultural revolution.

    接见时，霍查同志同代表们进行了十分亲切友好的谈话。霍查同志赞扬她们为争取在工作中传播新生事物、反对阻挡妇女前进的落后习惯和宗教残余而正在进行的巨大斗争。
    霍查同志向代表们指出，在努力工作的同时，要注意学习，不断提高自己的政治、思想和文化水平，以便使妇女在国家社会主义建设事业中发挥比以前更大的作用。

    全国妇女联合会中央理事会秘书长涅弗·穆夫蒂乌在会上就当前妇女解放等问题作了报告。与会代表对报告进行了热烈讨论。涅弗·穆夫蒂乌说，现在，我国人民正在同一切同新社会格格不入的东西进行斗争，埋葬旧风俗。在我国以新的形式出现的这一场社会主义思想同资产阶级思想的剧烈斗争中，妇女的彻底解放、提高她们的尊严、砸碎使妇女成为落后习俗和中世纪法规的奴隶的可恶的枷锁，是极重要的战线之一。
    她最后说，争取做一个为新生事物而斗争的战士，就是说要勇敢地处处传播新风俗和新习惯，勇敢地摧毁濒于崩溃的旧东西，从而建立起妇女的完全平等。
    会议还通过了致阿尔巴尼亚全国妇女的号召书，号召每个乡村、厂矿和居民区，建立战斗的妇女核心组织，动员更多的妇女参加生产劳动，为争取妇女的彻底解放而共同斗争。
    号召书号召刚成立的农业生产合作社的妇女尽速根除私有制的观点，树立新的共产主义道德，为巩固和加强农业生产合作社而努力工作。
    号召书说，我们为争取妇女的彻底解放的斗争是长期的和艰巨的。它是思想领域里的阶级斗争。让我们在进一步深入开展的思想和文化革命中，贡献出自己的力量。
