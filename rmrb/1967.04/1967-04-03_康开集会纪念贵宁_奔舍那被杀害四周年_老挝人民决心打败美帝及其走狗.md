	Khe Sanh, April 31—Various sectors of the Laotian people held a rally today in Khe Sanh to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the murder of Quinsay Boun Oum, former Foreign Minister of the Laotian National Union Government and Chairman of the Laotian Peace and Neutrality Party, by American imperialism and its lackeys.

	Representatives of the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front, Zalen; the Commander-in-Chief of the Military Command of the Laotian Patriotic Neutralist Forces, Colonel Don; and the Acting Chairman of the Laotian Peace and Neutrality Party, Mahakou, delivered speeches at the rally.

	In their speeches, they pointed out that the American imperialists and their lackeys viciously and brutally murdered Quinsay Boun Oum. However, they cannot destroy the fighting will of the Laotian people. On the contrary, this has further aroused the hatred of the Laotian people towards American imperialism and its lackeys. Today, the Laotian Patriotic Neutralist Forces, in close unity with the Laotian Patriotic Front, have achieved great victories in the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys.

	They expressed in their speeches the determination to complete the unfinished work of Quinsay Boun Oum.

	In their speeches, they strongly condemned the outrageous crimes of the American imperialists and their lackeys in their frenzied attacks on the liberated areas, and pointed out that as long as American imperialism continues its aggression in Laos and as long as Laos has not yet achieved peace and independence, the Laotian people are determined to continue the struggle until they thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its lackeys and liberate the entire country.

	Attending the memorial meeting were also representatives of the Supreme Command of the Laotian People's Liberation Army, General Singapore, and responsible persons from the Laotian Patriotic Neutralist Forces and other mass organizations.

	Representatives from the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos also attended the memorial meeting.

    康开集会纪念贵宁·奔舍那被杀害四周年
    老挝人民决心打败美帝及其走狗
    新华社康开三十一日电　老挝各界人士今天在康开举行集会，纪念老挝民族团结政府前外交大臣、老挝和平中立党主席贵宁·奔舍那被美帝国主义及其走狗杀害四周年。
    老挝爱国战线党中央代表扎伦、老挝爱国中立力量军事指挥部总指挥敦上校、老挝和平中立党代主席马哈古先后在会上讲了话。
    他们在讲话中指出，美帝国主义及其走狗卑鄙、野蛮地杀害了贵宁·奔舍那，但是它们无法摧毁老挝人民的斗争意志，相反地更加激起了老挝人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的仇恨。今天，老挝爱国中立力量同老挝爱国战线党紧密团结，在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中取得了很大的胜利。
    他们在讲话中都表示要完成贵宁·奔舍那没有完成的事业。
    他们在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗疯狂进攻解放区的滔天罪行，并指出，只要美帝国主义还在老挝进行侵略，只要老挝还没有获得和平、独立，老挝人民就决心继续战斗，直到彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗，解放全国。
    出席纪念会的，还有老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表辛加坡将军，老挝爱国中立力量和其他群众团体的负责人。
    中国驻老挝经济文化代表团的代表也出席了纪念会。
