Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Indonesia and Others Pass Through Phnom Penh, Warmly Welcomed by Chinese Embassy Staff, Experts, and Overseas Chinese

New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 28 — Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, arrived in Phnom Penh this morning on their way back to China. They were warmly welcomed by Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia, Chen Shuliang, staff of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, Chinese experts assisting Cambodia, and representatives of the overseas Chinese community and various circles in Phnom Penh.

Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren were declared "personae non gratae" by the reactionary Indonesian government, which had sided with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and were ordered to leave the country by April 29. They left Jakarta by plane early in the morning of April 28.

At the Phnom Penh airport, Yao Dengshan, in response to the greetings from the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, said, "The victories we have achieved in our struggle are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The Indonesian reactionaries cannot intimidate us. Whoever opposes us is opposing the people of the whole world."

Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren also met with the overseas Chinese compatriots and expressed their gratitude for their support and welcome.

    我驻印尼临时代办等路过金边
    受到我驻柬使馆人员、专家和华侨的热烈欢迎
    新华社金边二十八日电　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山和驻雅加达总领事徐仁，在回国途中今天上午到达金边，受到中国驻柬埔寨大使陈叔亮、中国大使馆工作人员、援助柬埔寨的中国专家以及在金边的华侨代表和各界人士的极为热烈的欢迎。
    姚登山和徐仁被投靠美帝苏修的印尼反动政府无理宣布为“不受欢迎的人”，并被限定于二十九日以前离境。他们在二十八日清晨乘飞机离开雅加达。
    在金边机场上，姚登山在答谢中国驻柬埔寨大使馆人员的问候时说，我们在斗争中所取得的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。印尼反动派是吓不倒我们的，谁反对我们，谁就是反对全世界人民。
    姚登山和徐仁还会见了华侨同胞，并对他们的支持和欢迎表示感谢。
