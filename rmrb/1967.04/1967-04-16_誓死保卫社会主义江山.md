Vow to Defend the Socialist Mountain

	Study Group Member of Chairman Mao's Works, South Mountain Village Brigade of Cunrui People's Commune in Huailai County, Father of Dong Cunrui Martyr, Dong Quanzhong

	For many years, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, wearing the cloak of an "old revolutionary," has been committing counter-revolutionary crimes. He has been closely allied with the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, and has been singing the opposite tune to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao calls on us poor and lower-middle peasants to organize and take the cooperative path, but he slashes cooperatives and advocates the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style of farming. Chairman Mao teaches us to hold high the three red banners and build socialism, but he promotes "three freedoms and one contract," spreading the wind of individual farming. Chairman Mao tells us not to forget class and class struggle, but he throws out the book "Tempering" to say there is no class struggle, no dictatorship of the proletariat. In short, he wants to overthrow our socialist mountain and restore capitalism in China. This is simply a pipe dream that will never come true!

	I am 68 years old now, and like the class brothers in South Mountain Village, I have tasted the sweetness of the new society and will never forget the bitterness of the old society. In the old society, landlords and rich farmers cruelly exploited us. They took the good land and dominated the good mountains. In the entire village, 80 to 90 households of poor and lower-middle peasants worked as long-term laborers for landlords and rich farmers in the spring, summer, and autumn, and in the winter, they went down to the coal mines to carry coal for the capitalists. South Mountain Village became famous as the "Long-term Laborer Village." Despite working so hard all year round, we still ended up with nothing to eat or wear. Yet, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party absurdly says that "exploitation is salvation" and "hiring labor is not exploitation," and even wants us to "welcome exploitation." This is the greatest slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants, it is extremely reactionary!

	Exploitation is a crime, rebellion is justified. Before liberation, to overturn our fate and seek liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants closely followed Chairman Mao in making revolution and eagerly sent our children to join the army. After liberation, we resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words and advanced on the path indicated by Chairman Mao. We resisted evil winds and suppressed evil waves, fighting against class enemies in the village and achieving one victory after another. Through these struggles, we poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt that our socialist mountain is truly hard-won. It was won under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, with the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, and with the high-held red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, through the hard work of the people of the entire nation. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party dares to make us poor and lower-middle peasants take the backward road, we will never agree. In the future, we will strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve ideological revolutionization, and ensure that the socialist mountain remains red for generations to come.

    誓死保卫社会主义江山
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、怀来县存瑞公社
    南山堡大队贫协主任、董存瑞烈士的父亲  董全忠
    多年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，披着“老革命”的外衣，干着反革命的罪恶勾当。他和社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子，打得火热，专跟我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席唱对台戏。毛主席号召我们贫下中农组织起来，走合作化道路，他却大砍合作社，大力提倡发展“三马一犁一车式的农民”；毛主席教导我们高举三面红旗，建设社会主义，他却鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮单干风；毛主席告诉我们千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争，他却抛出那本《修养》，不要阶级斗争，不要无产阶级专政。总之，他是妄想推翻我们社会主义的江山，在中国复辟资本主义。这简直是白日做梦，永远办不到！
    我今年六十八岁了，和南山堡的阶级弟兄一样，饱尝新社会的甜，也忘不了旧社会的苦。在旧社会，地主、富农残酷地剥削我们，好地他们占，好山他们霸。全村八、九十户贫下中农，春、夏、秋三季给地主、富农扛长工，冬天下煤窑给资本家背煤，南山堡成了有名的“长工庄”。就这样累死累活干一年，到头来还是没吃没穿。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却胡说什么“剥削是救人”，“雇工劳动，不叫剥削”，还要我们“欢迎剥削”。这是对我们贫下中农的最大污蔑，真是反动透顶！
    剥削就是有罪，造反就是有理。解放前，为了翻身求解放，我们贫下中农紧紧跟着毛主席闹革命，争着送子女参军。解放后，我们坚决听毛主席的话，按照毛主席指引的道路前进。我们顶邪风，压恶浪，跟村里的阶级敌人作斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。从斗争中，我们贫下中农深深体会到：我们的社会主义江山真是来之不易。它是在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，靠枪杆子打出来的，是成千成万的革命先烈流血牺牲换来的，是全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，艰苦奋斗创造出来的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟敢叫我们贫下中农走回头路，我们决不答应。今后，我们要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，确保社会主义的江山千秋万代永不变色。
