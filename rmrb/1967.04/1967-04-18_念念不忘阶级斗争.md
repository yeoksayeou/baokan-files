The top capitalist-roader in the Party's book "Self-Cultivation," published in July 1939, was a product of a time when Japanese imperialism was brutally attacking China, and the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, was actively anti-communist and passively resisting Japan, even plotting to surrender to the Japanese invaders. Within the Party, the right-opportunist line represented by Wang Ming was actively promoting rightist capitulationism. The national crisis was severe, and class contradictions were complex. Our great leader Chairman Mao led the nation in a valiant struggle against the invaders, saving the nation from peril. Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed the Party to correctly understand the situation of class struggle, to enhance the courage to fight the enemy, and to organize millions of people to win the war of resistance against Japan. At this critical moment, the top capitalist-roader in the Party released the book "Self-Cultivation," which completely ignored the reality of class struggle at the time, avoiding discussions on revolution, resistance against Japan, class struggle, and opposition to national and class capitulationism. Instead, it propagated Confucianism, calling on Communist Party members to engage in "personal cultivation."

In 1949, on the eve of the victory of the War of Liberation, the Party and the people faced a crucial question: after the democratic revolution's victory, where would China go? Would it follow the capitalist road or the socialist road? What kind of government would China establish? Would it be a bourgeois dictatorship or a proletarian dictatorship? The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of state power. On this issue, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie engaged in fierce and complex struggles. In June of that year, Chairman Mao published "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," stating that China could not establish a bourgeois republic but must establish a "people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." However, in August of that year, the top capitalist-roader in the Party again released "Self-Cultivation," avoiding discussions on the fundamental question of the revolution being the question of state power, avoiding discussions on the great struggle of the Chinese people to seize state power, and avoiding discussions on the proletarian dictatorship. In reality, it stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, providing ideological and theoretical foundations for the establishment of a bourgeois dictatorship in China.

In 1962, with natural disasters and temporary difficulties caused by Soviet modern revisionism, international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries colluded to sing anti-China tunes. Domestic ghosts and snakes stirred, attempting to stage a counter-revolutionary restoration. At this time, Chairman Mao warned the Party: never forget class struggle. It was at this moment that the top capitalist-roader in the Party, after careful revision, released the revised edition of "Self-Cultivation," still avoiding discussions on real class struggles and proletarian dictatorship, insisting that Party members engage in "cultivation" within their rooms.

Why does the top capitalist-roader in the Party, especially during times of sharp, complex, tense, and intense class struggle, always try to cover up class struggle and avoid important issues such as proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship? His plot is to prevent us from engaging in class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, to prevent proletarian revolution, and to prevent proletarian dictatorship, so that he can develop capitalism in China, stage a capitalist restoration, and establish a bourgeois dictatorship.

Our Communist Party is all about class struggle. Before liberation, we fought armed struggles, eliminated enemies, and seized state power from the hands of the reactionary ruling class. After liberation, we engaged in intense struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts, strengthening the proletarian dictatorship, consolidating the proletarian state power, and resolutely carrying out the socialist revolution to the end. Without class struggle, the proletariat would not be able to seize state power. After seizing state power, if we forget about class struggle, there is a risk of losing state power, and we would not be able to carry out the socialist revolution to the end, nor would we be able to achieve socialism and communism.

The class enemy fears nothing more than the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the proletarian revolution, and the proletarian dictatorship. They always try to erase class struggle, deny the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, aiming to numb the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people. Didn't Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, vigorously advocate for a "world without classes," a "party of the whole people," and a "state of the whole people"? The top capitalist-roader in the Party is peddling the same goods as Khrushchev, for the same purpose.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

Since the top capitalist-roader in the Party avoids discussing politics, real class struggle, and proletarian dictatorship, we must do the opposite, always remembering class struggle, always remembering proletarian dictatorship, always remembering to prioritize politics, and always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    念念不忘阶级斗争
    战士　张乃训　闻自德
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的《修养》一书，是一九三九年七月出笼的。那时，正是日本帝国主义猖狂进攻中国，蒋介石国民党积极反共，消极抗日，并阴谋投降日寇。在党内，以王明为代表的右倾机会主义者积极推行右倾投降主义路线。民族危机十分严重，阶级矛盾十分复杂。我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导着全国人民奋勇抗战，挽救民族的危亡。毛主席多次指示全党要正确认识阶级斗争形势，提高对敌斗争的勇气，组织千千万万的民众，争取抗日战争的胜利。就在这样一个关键时刻，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派抛出来的《修养》一书，竟完全脱离当时阶级斗争的现实，闭口不谈革命，不谈抗日，不谈阶级斗争，不谈反对民族投降主义和阶级投降主义，却大肆宣扬孔孟之道，号召共产党员进行什么“个人修养”。
    一九四九年，在解放战争取得全国胜利的前夕，全党和全国人民面临着一个极其重要的问题，就是在民主革命取得全国胜利后，中国究竟往哪里去？是走资本主义道路还是走社会主义道路？中国究竟建立什么样的政权？是实行资产阶级专政还是实行无产阶级专政？革命的根本问题是政权问题。在这个问题上，无产阶级和资产阶级展开了激烈、复杂的斗争。就在这年六月，毛主席发表了《论人民民主专政》，指出中国绝不能建立资产阶级的共和国，而只能建立“工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。但就在这年的八月，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派再次抛出了《修养》，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈中国人民夺取政权的伟大斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政，实际上是站在资产阶级反动立场上，为在中国实行资产阶级专政提供思想理论基础。
    一九六二年，随着自然灾害和苏联现代修正主义给我国造成的暂时困难，国际上的帝、修、反互相勾结，搞反华大合唱。国内的牛鬼蛇神也蠢蠢欲动，妄图搞反革命复辟。这时，毛主席告诫全党：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。就在这时，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派又经过精心修改，抛出了再版的《修养》，仍然绝口不谈现实的阶级斗争，不谈无产阶级专政，还是要党员关在屋子里“修养”再“修养”。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为什么越是在阶级斗争尖锐、复杂、紧张、激烈的时候，越是要掩盖阶级斗争，回避无产阶级革命，回避无产阶级专政等极其重要的问题呢？他的阴谋就是要我们不搞无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，不搞无产阶级革命，不搞无产阶级专政，以便他在中国发展资本主义，搞资本主义复辟，实行资产阶级专政。
    我们共产党，就是搞阶级斗争的。解放前，我们通过武装斗争，消灭敌人，从反动统治阶级手里夺取了政权。解放后，我们在政治、经济、思想、文化等各个战线上，大搞无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争、社会主义对资本主义的斗争，加强无产阶级专政，巩固无产阶级政权，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底。不搞阶级斗争，无产阶级就不可能得到政权。夺取政权以后，如果忘记了阶级斗争，就有失掉政权的危险，就不可能把社会主义革命进行到底，也就不可能实现社会主义和共产主义。
    阶级敌人最害怕无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，最害怕无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。他们总是竭力抹煞阶级斗争，否定无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，以图麻痹革命人民的斗争意志。赫鲁晓夫为了在苏联复辟资本主义，不是拚命宣扬“三无世界”、“全民党”和“全民国家”吗？党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所贩卖的那一套，同赫鲁晓夫宣扬的东西是一路货色，是为了同样的目的。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派既然闭口不谈政治，不谈现实的阶级斗争，不谈无产阶级专政，我们就一定要反其道而行之，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
