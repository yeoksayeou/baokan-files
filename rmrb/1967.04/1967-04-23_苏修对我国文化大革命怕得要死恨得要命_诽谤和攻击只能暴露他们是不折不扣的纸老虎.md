The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is advancing with an irresistible momentum, achieving one great victory after another. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is trembling with fear and cursing bitterly at the vigorous development of this unprecedented great revolutionary movement. These traitors, like the American imperialists, are extremely afraid that this revolution will turn socialist China into an unshakable proletarian stronghold, thoroughly shattering the imperialists' and modern revisionists' dream of "peaceful evolution" and restoring capitalism in China. They are particularly concerned that this revolution will inspire the revolutionary people of the world to rise up against them, overthrowing their reactionary rule. Therefore, as the Cultural Revolution deepens, the Soviet revisionist leadership and American imperialism, along with their lackeys, have joined forces to stage a frenzied anti-China farce. The Soviet revisionist leadership has taken the lead in these disgraceful performances, spreading rumors and slandering China's Cultural Revolution, attempting to resist and sabotage the profound impact of this great revolutionary movement worldwide.

	Propaganda Machines in Full Swing

	Soon after the start of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revisionist leadership, on the one hand, did everything possible to block the true news of the victory of the Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, mobilized all their propaganda machines to distort and slander this great revolution. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially after the Red Guards, full of revolutionary spirit, took to the streets to sweep away the dregs of the old society, the Soviet revisionist leadership was terrified. On August 31, 1966, they issued an anti-China statement in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU. On December 13 of the same year, they issued another resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU, further frenziedly attacking China. They used the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and other meetings to stir up wave after wave of anti-China hysteria. They also colluded with some lackeys to publish statements, communiqués, articles, and news items against and slandering China in newspapers and periodicals, and extensively reprinted anti-China remarks from Western newspapers. According to incomplete statistics, from September 1, 1966, to March 31, 1967, the fourteen central newspapers and periodicals in the Soviet Union, including *Pravda* and *Izvestia*, published more than 1,500 anti-China articles, launching an unprecedented anti-China campaign since the fall of Khrushchev.

	Soviet Revisionist Leaders Bare-Chested

	Since the beginning of this year, when China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a broader and deeper stage of development, and revolutionary masses across the country achieved great unity and launched struggles to seize power from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique was even more terrified and intensified their anti-China activities. In addition to continuing to use propaganda machines to slander, the Soviet revisionist leaders have been running around, conducting anti-China activities. From January 4 to 20 of this year, all the full and alternate members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU, as well as other party, government, and military officials, traveled to various parts of the Soviet Union to convene meetings of "party activists" in provinces, cities, autonomous regions, military districts, and military branches, vigorously peddling the Central Committee of the CPSU's anti-China resolution of last December and inciting anti-China sentiment. In early March, the leaders of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny, took to the stage in Moscow, launching a full-scale anti-China clamor. Their frenzied anti-China fervor far exceeded that of their predecessor Khrushchev.

	Shamelessly Attacking China Comprehensively

	The Soviet revisionist leadership has done everything in their power to spread rumors and slander. They first defamed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great innovation in the communist movement, as something that aims to "destroy everything" and promote "nihilism." They then slandered the Cultural Revolution as "anti-people" and "anti-socialist," and so on. They attacked the Red Guards, the vanguards of our Cultural Revolution, as "young hoodlums." They blatantly supported a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our Party and expressed "deep sympathy" for their shameful fate. They shamelessly slandered and attacked the domestic and foreign policies of China. They even maliciously slandered and attacked the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They even publicly called for the overthrow of the correct leadership of the great Communist Party of China, claiming that they "cannot stand idly by regarding what is happening in China," arrogantly advocating to exert so-called "influence" on the "situation in China," and so on, ad nauseam.

	The heads of the Soviet revisionist leadership have gone further and further in slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, competing with each other. On March 10, Brezhnev, at a meeting in Moscow, cursed the power struggles of the proletarian revolutionary masses across China as "suppressing the socialist revolution" and "reactionary military coups," raving madly that this Cultural Revolution is "a great national tragedy" for China. On March 6, Kosygin, in a speech, openly said that "the development of the situation in China has become another source of tension," and maliciously called for the Soviet Union to "not relax its attention to defense issues."

	At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leadership took a series of steps to further deteriorate Sino-Soviet relations, continuously provoking the People's Republic of China, and internationally intensifying the plotting of various conspiracies against China.

	Setting Sun, Brave Face but Cowardly Inside

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more the Soviet revisionist leadership frenziedly slanders the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the more viciously they attack the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, the more it proves that we are right and doing well, and that we must persist to the end!

	At present, the struggle of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is in an excellent situation. The great thought of Mao Zedong is shining brilliantly all over the world. The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is surging forward.

	In contrast, the Soviet revisionist leadership, like American imperialism, is in a desperate situation. They are paper tigers, appearing fierce but actually very weak. Their opposition to China will not end well; they will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet." The great people of the Soviet Union, who have the glorious tradition of the Great October Socialist Revolution, will not tolerate the Soviet revisionist leadership's small group of traitors trampling on the homeland of the October Revolution for long, destroying the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. They will surely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership, overthrow their reactionary rule, and build a brand-new, revolutionary Soviet Union!

    苏修对我国文化大革命怕得要死恨得要命
    诽谤和攻击只能暴露他们是不折不扣的纸老虎
    新华社二十二日讯  本社记者报道：我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正以排山倒海之势向前推进，取得一个又一个伟大的胜利。对于这场史无前例的大革命运动的蓬勃发展，苏联修正主义统治集团胆战心惊，切齿咒骂。这些叛徒们和美帝国主义者一样，十分害怕这场大革命使社会主义的中国变成无产阶级铁打的江山，彻底粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义企图在中国搞“和平演变”，复辟资本主义的迷梦。他们尤其担心这场革命将推动世界革命人民起来造他们的反，推翻他们的反动统治。因此，随着文化大革命的深入发展，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义及其走狗串通一气，联合演出了一场疯狂的反华丑剧。苏修领导集团在这些不光采的演出中充当急先锋，大肆造谣诬蔑，攻击中国文化大革命，妄图抵制和破坏这场伟大的革命运动在全世界产生的深远影响。
      宣传机器全部开动
    中国无产阶级文化大革命开始不久，苏修领导集团一面千方百计地封锁中国文化大革命胜利发展的真实消息，一面开动全部宣传机器，极力歪曲和诽谤这场大革命。在中国共产党八届十一中全会公报发表以后，特别是中国红卫兵小将意气风发地走上街头，以大无畏的革命精神横扫旧社会遗留下来的残渣积垢以来，苏联修正主义领导集团吓得发抖，在一九六六年八月三十一日，以苏共中央的名义发表反华公告。同年十二月十三日，又发表一项苏共中央决议，进一步猖狂反华。它们利用苏联最高苏维埃会议和其他一些集会，掀起了一阵阵的反华妖风。它们还伙同一些娄罗，连篇累牍地在报刊上发表反对和诽谤中国的声明、公报、文章和新闻，并且大量转载西方报刊的反华言论。据不完全统计，从一九六六年九月一日到一九六七年三月三十一日，单是苏联《真理报》、《消息报》等十四家中央报刊，就发表了一千五百多篇反华材料，掀起了一个自赫鲁晓夫下台以来规模空前的反华浪潮。
      苏修头目赤膊上阵
    今年年初以来，当中国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个更广阔、更深入的发展阶段，全国各地的无产阶级革命派实现大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争的时候，苏修叛徒集团更是惊恐万状，越发加紧了它们的反华活动。除了继续开动宣传机器进行诬蔑以外，苏联修正主义头目们四出奔走，进行反华活动。从今年一月四日到二十日，苏共中央政治局的全部正式委员和候补委员以及其他党政军要员，分赴苏联全国各地，召开州、市、边疆区以及各军区、各军种的“党员积极分子”会议，大力兜售苏共中央去年十二月反华决议，进行反华煽动。今年三月上旬，苏修统治集团的头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金、波德戈尔内又接连赤膊上阵，在莫斯科发出了全面反华的大鼓噪。他们狂热反华的劲头，远远超过了他们的前辈赫鲁晓夫。
      肆无忌惮全面反华
    苏修领导集团竭尽造谣诽谤之能事，它们始而诋毁中国文化大革命这个共产主义运动中的伟大创举是什么要“捣毁一切”、要搞“虚无主义”；继而又诬蔑中国文化大革命是什么“反人民的”和“反社会主义的”等等。它们攻击我国文化大革命的闯将红卫兵是什么“少年强盗”。它们明目张胆地为我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派撑腰打气，并且对他们的可耻下场“深表同情”。它们肆无忌惮地全面攻击中国的内外政策。它们无耻地诽谤和攻击当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。它们甚至公然叫嚣颠覆伟大的中国共产党的正确领导，声称“不能置身于中国发生的事情之外”，狂妄地鼓吹要对“中国局势”施加所谓“影响”，等等，不一而足。
    苏修领导集团的头目在诽谤中国文化大革命方面，越走越远，互相竞赛。勃列日涅夫三月十日在莫斯科的一次集会上，咒骂我国各地无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争是什么“镇压社会主义革命”，是“反动的军事政变”，气急败坏地胡说这场文化大革命对中国“是一个极大的民族悲剧”。柯西金三月六日在一次讲话中，公然说什么“中国事态的发展成了紧张局势的又一泉源”，并且别有用心地叫嚷苏联“不能放松对国防问题的注意”。
    与此同时，苏修领导集团采取了一系列进一步恶化中苏关系的严重步骤，不断向中华人民共和国猖狂挑衅，并且在国际上加紧策划反对中国的种种阴谋活动。
      日暮途穷色厉内荏
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。苏修领导集团越是猖狂地诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命，越是恶毒地攻击中国人民和中国共产党，就越证明我们做得对，做得好，而且必须坚持做到底！
    目前，全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，形势一片大好。伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界放射着万丈光芒。中国无产阶级文化大革命的洪流正在浩浩荡荡地奔腾前进。
    与此相反，苏联修正主义领导集团，同美帝国主义一样，陷入了日暮途穷的境地。它们是不折不扣的纸老虎，表面上气势汹汹，骨子里却虚弱得很。它们反对中国绝不会有好下场，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。具有伟大的十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，决不会容忍苏修领导集团这一小撮叛徒长期糟踏十月革命的故乡，破坏中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。他们总要起来大造苏修领导集团的反，推翻它们的反动统治，重新建立一个崭新的、革命的苏联！
