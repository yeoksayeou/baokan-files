The Lao People's Patriotic Front condemned the Thai authorities for allowing U.S. B-52 bombers to be stationed in Thailand. The Front warned that the Lao patriotic people and soldiers will take decisive measures to counter this new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Baobang clique.

The statement pointed out that after the U.S. imperialists convened the Guam conference, they hastened to send B-52 bombers to Thailand. This is a new act of aggression aimed at expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam to the entire Indochina Peninsula.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists believe that by stationing B-52 bombers in Thailand, they will be closer to the Indochina battlefield, which will be advantageous to their war of aggression. This is sheer wishful thinking. The U.S. imperialists' actions will not only fail to extricate themselves from the predicament in Indochina but will suffer even more shameful and heavier defeats.

The statement emphasized that the Lao people and the Lao People's Patriotic Front fully support the statement of protest issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 31 against the U.S. B-52 bombers in Thailand. The Lao people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese and Cambodian people, to fully support the struggle of the Thai people under the leadership of the Patriotic Front against U.S. imperialism and the Thai puppet regime, and to make the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys suffer a shameful defeat.

The Lao patriotic people and soldiers in Savannakhet Province shot down three U.S. aggressor planes on March 3, killing four bandits and foiling the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs' plot to air-drop bandits into the liberated areas.

That day, the enemy dispatched several A-D6 type planes to bomb and strafe the area east of Mung Nong County in Savannakhet Province, covering the air-dropping of bandits by helicopters. The vigilant local patriotic people and soldiers bravely fought back, shooting down two U.S. helicopters and one A-D6 plane, killing four bandits, and capturing many.

According to the same radio station, the people and soldiers of Xieng Khouang Province annihilated 98 enemy troops on March 22 on the 13th Highway, seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies. The people and soldiers of Luang Prabang Province killed and wounded 140 enemy troops on March 23 in a counterattack against the enemy's invasion of the Mudai region, seizing many weapons and ammunition.

    老挝爱国战线党谴责美国B—52型飞机进驻泰国
    美帝扩大战争必遭惨败
    新华社康开五日电　据巴特寮电台四日广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会，四日发表声明，谴责泰国当局让美国B—52型轰炸机进驻泰国。声明严厉警告美国侵略者和泰国反动当局，老挝爱国军民将采取坚决措施，来对付美帝国主义及其仆从他侬—巴博集团这一新的战争行动。
    声明指出，美帝国主义策划召集关岛会议之后，加紧向泰国派遣B—52型飞机，这是它为了实现把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那的计划而采取的一个新的战争行动。
    声明指出，美帝国主义以为把B—52型飞机派驻泰国，使之更加靠近印度支那战场，就会有利于它的侵略战争。这完全是痴心妄想。美帝国主义的这种行动不但不能摆脱它在印度支那的困境，相反将会遭到更加可耻和更加惨重的失败。
    声明强调说，老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党，完全支持越南民主共和国外交部三月三十一日就美国B—52型飞机进驻泰国发表的抗议声明。老挝人民决心同越南人民和柬埔寨人民并肩战斗，全力支持在泰国爱国阵线领导下的泰国人民反对美帝国主义和泰国卖国统治集团的斗争，使美帝国主义及其仆从遭到可耻的失败。
    新华社康开五日电　据巴特寮电台五日广播：老挝沙湾拿吉省爱国军民三月三日击落美国强盗飞机三架，打死土匪四名，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗集团派遣直升飞机空投土匪进犯解放区的阴谋。
    这一天，敌人出动一些A·D6型飞机到沙湾拿吉省芒农县以东进行狂轰滥炸，掩护直升飞机空投土匪。保持高度警惕的当地爱国军民，英勇还击，一举击落美国直升飞机两架和A·D6型飞机一架，打死土匪四名，俘虏多名。
    另据这家电台广播，西番顿省军民三月二十二日在第十三号公路上消灭敌人九十八名，缴获一批武器和军用物资。琅勃拉邦省军民三月二十三日在反击敌军进犯木达来地区的战斗中，共打死打伤敌人一百四十名，缴获许多武器、弹药。
