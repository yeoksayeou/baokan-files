The liberation armed forces in the western part of South Vietnam's Ninh Thuan Province launched a surprise attack on the U.S. military base in Tam Quan on March 10, delivering a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors participating in the "sweep" of the northern part of Ninh Thuan Province. In this battle, the liberation armed forces achieved a glorious victory, annihilating over 500 enemy troops, destroying 170 enemy vehicles, and 10 artillery pieces.

As dusk fell over the forests of Ninh Thuan Province, the liberation armed forces soldiers silently approached the enemy's base. The artillery soldiers, with extraordinary determination, carefully carried tons of weapons, helping each other cross deep valleys and dense forests.

In front of them was the Tam Quan base of a U.S. regiment participating in the "sweep." Over a thousand U.S. troops were stationed there, equipped with hundreds of armored vehicles and an artillery battalion.

The liberation army soldiers quickly took up their positions.

Suddenly, the artillery on a nearby U.S. base fired a few blind shots into the forest where the liberation army soldiers were building fortifications. Then, it fell silent again.

At 9:05, the liberation armed forces' artillery began to roar like thunder. Under the cover of artillery fire, the infantry of the liberation armed forces leaped out of the trenches and charged bravely towards the enemy's defensive positions. The shells hit their targets accurately. The enemy command post, artillery positions, and parking lot were instantly engulfed in flames. The U.S. command was thrown into chaos.

At the same time that the attack on Tam Quan was launched, another detachment of the liberation armed forces attacked the enemy base at Bau Grotto, about 20 kilometers south of Highway 4. After the liberation armed forces fired the first volley, Bau Grotto was also paralyzed. The U.S. troops there were unable to fire a single shell to support the defenders in Tam Quan.

Meanwhile, the liberation army soldiers in Tam Quan, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, charged towards the heart of the enemy base.

The task of the second company was to break through the main gap in the enemy's outer defensive wall. They successively crossed three obstacles set up by the enemy, passed through another wall flattened by the liberation armed forces' artillery, and rushed to the outskirts of the U.S. barracks. This wall was composed of rows of reinforced concrete defensive works, protected by dozens of armored vehicles. Here, the liberation army soldiers bravely engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.

The second company, taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, dispatched another group of soldiers to attack the U.S. base headquarters from the north.

In the western part, the sixth company crossed numerous trenches, minefields, and barbed wire fences, entering the enemy's artillery positions. There, several enemy artillery pieces were destroyed, and the bodies of dead U.S. artillerymen lay beside them.

The soldiers of the second company quickly disabled thirteen armored vehicles. Squad leader Ah Xiu used an anti-tank gun to destroy three tanks, then turned to the left and silenced a machine gun with a grenade. Deputy squad leader Ah Fu also disabled four vehicles to his right.

At this time, the battle at Bau Grotto also ended, with 200 U.S. invaders killed or wounded, 50 vehicles, and 12 artillery pieces destroyed.

The artillery and infantry of the liberation armed forces worked closely together, launching a frontal assault on one of the most heavily defended enemy positions. This attack demonstrated that the fierce assault of a revolutionary army, filled with intense hatred for the enemy and fully supported by the people, is something that no enemy weapon or tactic can stop.

    英雄勇摧敌阵
    ——记南越解放武装力量同班大捷
    越南南方西宁省解放武装力量三月十日奇袭同班地区美军驻地，给了参加对西宁省北部大“扫荡”的美国侵略军一次沉重的打击。在这场战斗中，解放武装力量取得了消灭敌人五百多名、击毁敌人军车一百七十辆和大炮十门的辉煌战果。
    暮色降临西宁省的林区。解放武装力量战士静悄悄地向敌人的基地靠拢。炮兵们小心地、以非凡的毅力扛着成吨的武器，向前移动，互相帮助越过深谷，穿过密林。
    他们面前就是参加大“扫荡”的美军一个旅作战基地同班。这里驻有一千多名美军，配备着数百辆装甲车和一个炮兵营。
    解放军战士迅速地进入阵地。
    突然，附近美军阵地上的大炮盲目地向解放军战士正在修筑工事的丛林地带乱打了几炮。接着，又转入了沉寂。
    九点零五分，解放武装力量的大炮开始雷鸣般地怒吼起来。解放武装力量的步兵在大炮的掩护下，跃出战壕，向敌人防御阵地勇猛冲去。炮弹准确地落在目标上。敌军指挥所、炮兵阵地和停车场，顿时被大火吞没。美军指挥部陷入一片混乱。
    在对同班发动进攻的同时，解放武装力量的另一支小分队袭击了四号公路南面约二十公里的保果敌军阵地。在解放武装力量的第一排炮打出去之后，保果也陷于瘫痪状态。那里的美军无法打出一发炮弹去支援同班的守敌。
    与此同时，在同班的解放军战士紧握上了刺刀的枪，向敌人基地的心脏猛插过去。
    第二连战士的任务是打开敌人外围防御墙的主要缺口。他们连续越过了敌人设置的三道障碍，穿过被解放武装力量的大炮轰倒的另一道围墙，冲到美军兵营的外围墙下。这道墙是由一排排钢筋混凝土防御工事组成，有几十辆装甲车保护。在这里，解放军战士英勇地和敌人展开了激烈的白刃战。
    二连乘敌人乱成一团时，派遣另一部分战士从北面袭击美军基地总部。
    在西冀，六连越过重重壕沟、地雷阵地和铁丝网，进入敌人炮兵阵地。在那里，敌人的十几门大炮被击毁，旁边躺满被打死的美军炮兵的尸体。
    二连的战士迅速地把十三辆装甲车打得开不动了。排长阿秀用防坦克炮击毁三辆坦克，接着又转向左边，用一枚手榴弹把一挺机枪打哑了。副班长阿福也把他右边的四辆车子打得不能动了。
    这时，保果的战斗也结束了，两百名美国侵略者被打死打伤，五十辆军车和十二门大炮被击毁。
    解放武装力量的炮兵同步兵紧密配合，对美国侵略军一个防守最严密的阵地发动的这次正面袭击表明：对敌人满怀强烈仇恨并得到人民全力支援的革命军队的猛烈进攻，是敌人的任何武器或战术都阻挡不了的。
