    Are capitalists who exude bloodlust from every pore also serving the people? This is what the top capitalist-roader within the Party claims. Hearing such shameless nonsense fills me with rage. Now, let me recount an incident I personally experienced on the battlefield in Korea, to see just who these capitalists are serving.

    When the Chinese People's Volunteers went to Korea to fight against the Americans, our country had just been liberated, and many factories were still under the control of capitalists. The volunteers had to purchase many military supplies from these capitalists. In 1951, a capitalist in Shanghai sold us a batch of emergency medical kits at an exorbitant price, which were then transported to the front lines in Korea. This evil capitalist only cared about making money and paid no heed to the quality of his products. He used rotten cotton and torn rags picked from the garbage, which had not been properly disinfected, to make these emergency medical kits. When our volunteer soldiers were wounded on the battlefield and used these kits, not only did their injuries fail to improve, but they worsened. Many comrades lost their lives as a result. This is what the top capitalist-roader within the Party means by "capitalists also serving the people."

    Marx said, "Capital comes into the world dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt." This is the most accurate description of capital. Capitalists are driven by profit. "You can't get rich without killing the poor" is their logic. Can capitalists who exude bloodlust from every pore serve the people? The top capitalist-roader within the Party is whitewashing the capitalists because he and the capitalists are in cahoots, sitting in the same boat. We, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never fall for his tricks. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly purge the poison he has spread, knock him down to the ground, and stomp on him with our feet, so that he will never be able to rise again.

### 每个毛孔都有血腥气味的资本家“也是为人民服务”吗？

    每个毛孔都有血腥气味的资本家“也是为人民服务”吗？
    解放军某部营长　王正义
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派说：“资本家也是为人民服务。”听了这种无耻的胡说，满腔燃起了怒火。现在我讲讲在朝鲜战场上亲身经历过的一件事，看看资本家到底是为谁服务的？
    中国人民志愿军赴朝抗美作战时，我国刚解放不久，很多工厂还被资本家掌握着。志愿军的很多军事用品要向资本家订购。一九五一年，上海的一个资本家用高价向我们出售了一批急救包，运到了朝鲜前线。这个万恶的资本家只求赚钱，根本不顾产品的质量，把从垃圾堆里拾来的未经过严格消毒的烂棉花、破布条，做成了急救包。我志愿军战士在火线上负伤时，一用上这种急救包，不但伤势不得好转，反而日渐恶化。许多同志因此失去了生命。这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所说的“资本家也是为人民服务。”
    马克思说：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”这是对资本的最真实写照。资本家唯利是图。“杀不了穷人发不了家”，就是他们的逻辑。每个毛孔都散发着血腥气味的资本家，能够为人民服务吗？党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为资本家涂脂抹粉，最根本的原因就是他和资本家穿的是一条裤子，坐的是一条凳子。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，是永远不会上他的当的。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派放出的毒彻底肃清，把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，让他永世不得翻身。
