The Book of Chairman Mao: Beloved by Revolutionary People
The People of Congo (Brazzaville) Love the Story of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao"

**Delight in the Revolutionary Treasure**

One day, an excited Congolese (Brazzaville) youth could not contain his joy. He patted his pocket and eagerly told a reporter, "I am fortunate to have obtained a revolutionary treasure." Following the youth's gesture, the reporter noticed that he had a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his pocket.

The youth's name is Yidu'a. He is a student at a technical school in Brazzaville. He told the reporter that he and several classmates had long organized themselves to collectively study and copy Chairman Mao's quotations. He continued, "Since we only have one copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' everyone can only copy and read it. My classmates hope that everyone can obtain the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'"

The youth took out the little red book he had just received from a Chinese friend and proudly said, "We all call the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' the revolutionary treasure. To become a revolutionary, it is impossible without the revolutionary treasure as a guide."

**Forever a Revolutionary**

At the airport, the plane was about to take off. After a long conversation, two Congolese (Brazzaville) youths had to say goodbye. Just as the shorter youth had taken a few steps towards the plane, the older youth called him back, ran up, and took out a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his pocket, giving it to him. He instructed, "Take it with you, don't forget the revolution."

The plane took off. The reporter, with a heart full of excitement, approached the remaining youth. Seeing a Chinese person, the youth enthusiastically introduced himself, saying, "The one who just boarded the plane is his younger brother, who is going abroad to study. Previously, the two brothers often studied the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' together and exchanged their learning experiences. He said, 'My younger brother loves to read Chairman Mao's books and has boundless admiration for the great Chairman Mao. Every time he reads the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' he always looks at the great image of Chairman Mao printed in the book.' He continued, 'My younger brother is leaving, and it will be a few years before he returns. At the time of parting, I decided to give him my most beloved little red book, hoping that he will always read Chairman Mao's books and become a revolutionary."

**Thank Chairman Mao for His Teachings**

One day, a reporter in a bookstore in Brazzaville met a soldier from the Congolese (Brazzaville) Civil Defense Corps. He was selecting works by Chairman Mao. Seeing a Chinese friend, he enthusiastically shook the reporter's hand and said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, thank you, 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'" He then recounted an incident that happened after he read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

He said that another soldier in the Civil Defense Corps, Andre, was from the north, while he was from the south. The two often quarreled and did not speak to each other. Recently, this southern soldier bought a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He said, "I studied this quotation by Chairman Mao: 'We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.... Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.' I thought, if it were not for defending the fruits of the August Revolution, Andre and I would not be working together. Therefore, following Chairman Mao's teachings, Andre and I have made up."

The soldier excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is so correct. Reading his works, I have learned many revolutionary truths."

    毛主席的书革命人民最爱读
    刚果（布）人民热爱《毛主席语录》的故事
    喜得革命宝书
    一天，一位陌生的刚果（布）青年按捺不住他内心的喜悦，拍着口袋，兴奋地对记者说：“我幸运地得到了一本革命者的宝书”。随着这位青年的手势，记者发现，他口袋里装着一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。
    这位青年名叫伊都阿，是布拉柴维尔一所技术学校的学生。他告诉记者说，他同几个同学老早就组织起来集体学习和相互抄录毛主席的语录。他接着说：因为只有一本《毛主席语录》，大家只能抄着读。同学们希望人人都能得到《毛主席语录》。
    这位青年从口袋里拿出他刚从中国朋友那里得到的小红书，并自豪地说：“我们大家把《毛主席语录》称作革命者的宝书。要成为革命者，没有革命宝书作指南是不可能的。”
    永当革命者
    在机场上，飞机就要起飞了。两位刚果（布）青年经过一番长谈后不得不握手告别。当矮个子青年刚向飞机走了几步，留下的年长一点的青年喊住了他，跑上前去从口袋里掏出了一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》送给了他，并嘱咐说：“带上它，别忘了革命”。
    飞机起飞了。记者怀着激动的心情走近留下的那位青年身旁。见到中国人，这位青年象见了老朋友，主动地介绍说：刚才上飞机的是他的弟弟，是到国外去学习的。以前，他们弟兄俩经常在一起学习《毛主席语录》，相互交流学习的体会。他说：“弟弟最爱读毛主席的书，对伟大的毛主席无限敬仰，每次读《毛主席语录》前，他总要看看印在书上的伟大的毛主席像。”他接着说：“弟弟走了，要几年后才能回来。临别时，我决心将自己最心爱的小红书送给他，愿他经常读毛主席的书，做个革命者。”
    感谢毛主席教导
    一天，记者在布拉柴维尔一家书店碰到一位刚果（布）民防团的战士，他正在选购毛主席著作。看到中国朋友，他热情地握着记者的手说：“谢谢毛主席，谢谢《毛主席语录》。”接着他讲述他读了《毛主席语录》以后的一件事。
    他说，和他在一起工作的另一位民防团的战士安德烈是北方人，他是南方人，他们两人经常争吵，谁也不理睬对方。前不久，这位南方籍的战士买到了一本《毛主席语录》。他说：“我学习了毛主席的这段语录：‘我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’我想，如果不是为了保卫八月革命的成果，我和安德烈就不会在一起工作。因此我按照毛主席教导，我和安德烈已经和好了。”
    这位战士兴奋地说：
  “毛主席讲得太正确了，读了他的著作，我懂得了许多革命道理。”
