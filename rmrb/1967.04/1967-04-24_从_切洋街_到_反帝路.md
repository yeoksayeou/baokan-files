In the late Qing Dynasty, the Boxer Rebellion, which shook the world, was a great revolutionary mass movement against imperialism and feudalism in modern Chinese history. It laid a solid foundation for the great victory of the Chinese people fifty years later.

Among the glorious achievements of the Boxers' heroic struggle, there was such a heartwarming episode: the Boxers despised the imperialists, and they renamed the foreign legation quarter, Dongjiaomin Lane, as "Cut Foreigner Street," and renamed the Qiaoheshi Bridge as "Break Foreigner Bridge." During their parades, they often shouted "Kill the foreign devils" with the common people, making the imperialists tremble. Some were so frightened that they hid in coffins, hiring people to blow and beat drums, trying to escape the city.

The great Boxer Rebellion greatly suppressed the arrogance of the imperialist invaders and boosted the morale of the Chinese people! Their heroic struggle is the glory and pride of the Chinese people! Looking back at this historical fact, we revolutionary people feel invigorated and proud, and cannot help but think of the following.

On August 18 last year, after our most beloved leader Chairman Mao received the Red Guards, the revolutionary Red Guard youths, with boundless enthusiasm, went from schools to society, using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, launching a fierce attack on all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The Red Guards proposed that Beijing is the capital of our great motherland and the center of the proletarian revolution. How can the streets tolerate the stench of names left by imperialism, feudalism, and the bourgeoisie! With the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of revolutionary people, they initiated the renaming of the embassy area "Dongjiaomin Lane," which was forbidden to laborers before liberation, to "Anti-Imperialism Road," and "Xijiaomin Lane" to "Anti-Revisionism Road"...

"With the golden monkey raising the thousand-jin stick, the jade sky is cleared of a million dusts." The Red Guards' revolutionary action of breaking old habits and establishing new ones has added unlimited luster to the capital. The revolutionary spirit of the young rebels is excellent!

From "Cut Foreigner Street" and "Break Foreigner Bridge" to "Anti-Imperialism Road" and "Anti-Revisionism Road," the birth of these road signs with distinct revolutionary colors is not just a simple change of names, but a symbol of the victory of the revolutionary mass movements of the Boxers and the Red Guards.

The birth of these names is like two interludes in the revolutionary mass movements, with their full passion, clear rhythm, and high-pitched tone, singing out the voice of the Chinese people who have always hated, despised, and looked down upon imperialism and all reactionaries.

The birth of these names is like two waves in the revolutionary mass movements, behind which is a surging and roaring torrent. If imperialism and all reactionaries dare to block this magnificent revolutionary torrent, they will surely be buried in the vast sea of the revolutionary mass movements.

History is the best witness. On the issue of how to deal with such great revolutionary mass movements as the Boxers and the Red Guards, people always have two completely different attitudes.

One is to stand on the side of the revolutionary people, enthusiastically praising and actively supporting the revolutionary mass movements; the other is to stand on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, extremely hating and fiercely suppressing the revolutionary mass movements.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has given high praise to the Boxer Rebellion, believing that it "showed the tenacious spirit of resistance of the Chinese people who were not willing to submit to imperialism and its running dogs."

Only all reactionaries regard the Boxers as a flood and a beast. The Guangxu Emperor, in his edict to the cabinet, said: "This summer (the tenth month of the 26th year of Guangxu), the Boxer rebels caused trouble and provoked the friendly countries." According to the "Records of the Past," it is recorded: "When the Empress Dowager was about to flee, the Emperor said, 'There is no need to flee, the foreigners are all friendly countries, their soldiers are suppressing the Boxer rebels, and they have no malicious intentions towards our country. I request to go to Dongjiaomin Lane and talk to the envoys of various countries, and there will be no trouble.'" Here, Guangxu called the Boxers "Boxer rebels" and called the imperialists "friendly countries," which is completely recognizing the enemy as a father. Clearly, various imperialist countries came to this place in China to invade China, which aroused the Chinese people to rise up and fight against imperialism, but Guangxu and his ilk used words like "causing trouble," "provoking," and "malicious intentions" to maliciously slander the Boxer revolutionary mass movement, in order to cover up their shameful act of going to Dongjiaomin Lane to surrender humbly to the imperialists, and to exonerate the invaders. This completely exposed the despicable face of the feudal rulers who were willing to be the running dogs of imperialism.

The reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" also maliciously slandered and defamed the Boxer revolutionary mass movement. The film used words like "killing and arson" and "acting like madmen" to viciously attack and defame the Boxers. The film depicted the Chinese people as "being slaughtered like fish and meat" in front of the invaders, completely powerless to resist. The number one capitalist-roaders within the party praised this film that slandered the revolutionary mass movement, which exactly shows that he hates what the people love and loves what the people hate, and is in cahoots with the reactionaries.

If the attitude towards the Boxer movement in history is a dividing line between revolutionaries and reactionaries, then in real struggles, how to deal with the Red Guard movement is a touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries.

Last August, when the great Red Guard movement just emerged, our great leader Chairman Mao gave it the greatest support with the greatest enthusiasm, making it develop rapidly. The revolutionary Red Guards carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to break through, dare to struggle, and dare to make a revolution, breaking through the obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, making a big fuss against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, smashing the four olds of the exploiting class, and establishing the four new of the proletariat. The revolutionary Red Guards, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have made immortal contributions in the Cultural Revolution.

In stark contrast, the number one capitalist-roader within the party was terrified and hated the revolutionary mass movement to death. He colluded with another major capitalist-roader within the party, formulated and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, confused right and wrong, mixed black and white, besieged the revolutionaries, suppressed the masses, carried out white terror, boosted the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and suppressed the morale of the proletariat. On the issue of cadres, they implemented the reactionary policy of "striking a large area and protecting a small number." In the end, they wanted to do everything possible to protect themselves and a small number of revisionists to get by.

However, history is ruthless. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Their various persecutions of the revolutionary people "will ultimately only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." In the process of the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao, with the attitude of "do not say I did not warn you," sternly warned the number one capitalist-roader within the party: those who suppress the student movement will not have a good end! As expected, the irresistible torrent of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat surged forward and developed victoriously. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionaries defeated the bourgeois reactionary line and pulled down the number one capitalist-roader within the party, finally making him get the deserved outcome.

Of course, the number one capitalist-roader within the party and other small handful of revisionists will not be reconciled to their failure. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue the revolution, and never stop revolutionizing, so that our motherland will always be young with revolution, and let our proletarian revolutionary rebellious spirit forever surge throughout the world!

    从“切洋街”到“反帝路”
    柯夫
    清代末年，威震中外的义和团运动，是中国近代史上一次伟大的反帝、反封建的革命群众运动。它为五十年后中国人民的伟大胜利，奠定了一块坚固的基石。
    在义和团英勇斗争的光辉业绩中，有这样一段大快人心的往事：义和团蔑视帝国主义分子，他们把驻有外国使馆的东交民巷改名为“切洋街”，御河桥改为“断洋桥”。他们在游行时，经常同市民高呼“杀洋鬼子”的口号，使帝国主义分子听了发抖。有的吓得躲进棺材，雇人吹打着，企图逃出城外。
    伟大的义和团运动，大灭帝国主义侵略者的威风，大长中国人民的志气！他们的英勇斗争，是中国人民的光荣和骄傲！回顾这一段史实，我们革命人民感到身心振奋，扬眉吐气，不禁发为联想。
    去年八月十八日，当我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席接见红卫兵以后，革命的红卫兵小将们，带着冲天的干劲，从学校走向社会，以毛泽东思想为武器，向一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯发动了猛烈攻击。红卫兵们提出，北京是我们伟大祖国的首都，是无产阶级革命的中心，大街上怎能容忍帝国主义、封建主义和资产阶级留下的臭名字！他们在广大革命群众的热烈支持下，倡议把解放前禁止劳动人民通行的使馆区“东交民巷”改为“反帝路”，把“西交民巷”改为“反修路”……
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”红卫兵们这一破旧立新的革命行动，为首都增添了无限的光彩，小将们的无产阶级革命造反精神好得很！
    从“切洋街”、“断洋桥”到“反帝路”、“反修路”，这些具有鲜明革命色彩的路标的诞生，决不是简单的名称上的变易，而是义和团、红卫兵革命群众运动胜利的象征。
    这些名称的诞生，象是革命群众运动中的两支插曲，以其饱满的激情，明快的节奏，高亢的音调，唱出了中国人民一贯仇视、蔑视、鄙视帝国主义和一切反动派的心声。
    这些名称的诞生，象是革命群众运动中迸发出来的两朵浪花，在它的背后是汹涌澎湃的滚滚洪流，帝国主义和一切反动派如果胆敢阻挡这一波澜壮阔的革命洪流，则必然被埋葬在革命群众运动的汪洋大海之中。
    历史是最好的见证人。在如何对待义和团、红卫兵这样伟大的革命群众运动的问题上，人们总是存在两种截然不同的态度。
      一种是站在革命人民方面，热情歌颂和积极支持革命的群众运动；另一种是站在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义方面，极端仇视和疯狂压制革命的群众运动。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席对于义和团运动曾经给予高度评价，认为它“表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神”。
    只有一切反动派才把义和团视若洪水猛兽。当年的光绪，在他给内阁的手谕中说：“本年夏间（光绪二十六年十月），拳匪媾乱，开衅友邦”。又据《遗事录》记载：“太后之将奔也，皇上求之曰，无需出走，外人皆友邦，其兵讨拳匪，对我国家非有恶意，臣请自往东交民巷，向各国使臣面谈，必无事矣。”在这里，光绪称义和团为拳匪，称帝国主义者为友邦，完全是认贼作父。明明是各帝国主义国家跑到中国这块地方来侵略中国，因而激起中国人民群众奋起反抗帝国主义的斗争，而光绪之流，却用“媾乱”，“开衅”等字眼，恶毒地诬蔑义和团革命群众运动，借以掩盖他们“自往东交民巷”，向帝国主义者屈辱投降的卖国行径，并为侵略者开脱罪责。这就赤裸裸地暴露了封建统治者甘当帝国主义乏走狗的卑鄙嘴脸。
    反动影片《清宫秘史》，对义和团革命群众运动，同样竭尽诽谤诬蔑之能事。影片用“杀人放火”，“状如疯魔”等恶毒字眼，肆意攻击和丑化义和团。影片描写中国人民在侵略者面前，完全是
  “人为刀俎，我为鱼肉”，任人宰割而无力反抗。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，竟然吹捧这部诽谤革命群众运动的影片，恰好说明他爱人民之所恨，恨人民之所爱，同反动派完全是臭肉同味，沆瀣一气。
    如果说，对待历史上的义和团运动的态度如何，是区别革命派和反动派的分水岭，那末，在现实斗争中，如何对待红卫兵运动，则是区分真革命还是假革命、反革命的试金石。
    去年八月，当伟大的红卫兵运动刚兴起的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，就以最大的热情支持这一新生事物，使之迅速发展起来。革命的红卫兵发扬了敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢斗争、敢革命的精神，冲破资产阶级反动路线的阻力，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。革命的红卫兵，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋。
    成为鲜明对比的是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对革命的群众运动怕得要死，恨得要命。他勾结了另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，制定和推行资产阶级反动路线，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，镇压群众，实行白色恐怖，长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气。在对待干部问题上，他们实行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策。归根结底，他们就是想千方百计保护自己以及一小撮修正主义分子蒙混过关。
    然而，历史是无情的。毛主席早就教导我们：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”他们“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。在文化大革命的进程中，毛主席又以“勿谓言之不预”的态度，严正警告党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派之流：凡是镇压学生运动的人都没有好下场！果不其然，无产阶级文化大革命的洪流锐不可挡地向前胜利发展，无产阶级革命派在毛主席的革命路线指引下，击败了资产阶级反动路线，将党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马来，终于使他得到了应得的下场。
    当然，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，以及其他一小撮修正主义分子决不会甘心于他们的失败。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续革命，不断革命，使我们的祖国永葆革命之青春，让我们的无产阶级革命造反精神，永远磅礴于全世界！
