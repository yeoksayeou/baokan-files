Xinxian First-Line Command Post Guides Work According to Local Conditions
Dispatches Large Number of Cadres to the Countryside to Promote the Revolution and Spring Plowing
Helps Different Types of Regions Solve Practical Problems, Revolution and Production Thrive Throughout the County

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 16 — The Xinxian First-Line Command Post for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production has dispatched revolutionary and production combat teams to different types of regions to conduct in-depth investigations and comprehensive guidance. They have strengthened leadership in spring plowing production by dividing areas and categorizing them. While leading the county's common production activities, the command post has specifically helped different types of regions solve local practical problems, further promoting the thriving of revolution and production throughout the county.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction in Xinxian seized power in early February, they quickly established the county's First-Line Command Post for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production." In their leadership work, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Any work task, if there is no general and universal call, cannot mobilize the masses to take action. But if it is limited to a general call, and the leading cadres do not concretely and directly implement the work called for in several organizations, break through one point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units, it is impossible to test whether the general call is correct, nor to enrich the content of the general call, and there is a danger of the general call becoming empty." Through study, everyone further realized that the conditions in various regions are different. To effectively strengthen spring plowing production on the front line, it is necessary to lead according to local conditions. They divided the county into nine areas based on natural conditions, political foundations, work status, and current problems. They dispatched over 800 cadres to form revolutionary and production combat teams to go to these places and guide work according to local conditions. Revolutionary leading cadres set an example by personally going to the front line. In addition to overseeing the overall work, they each have a fixed contact point. The county's Military Affairs Department and a large number of cadres and soldiers from local troops also went deep into various regions. Each revolutionary and production combat team seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting ideological revolutionization. Team members stationed in the areas conducted investigations and research by living and working with poor and lower-middle peasants, guiding the work. The command post, to facilitate front-line work, went to the front line as much as possible to convey upper-level instructions, assign tasks, and compile and print "Battle Reports" to communicate the situation in various regions.

In the more than fifty days since the Xinxian First-Line Command Post for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production implemented classified guidance, good results have been achieved. This county had little snow and rain last winter and this spring, and the drought was more severe in mountainous and hilly areas. The combat teams addressed the active thoughts of some brigade cadres who did not pay attention to anti-drought work. They repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on "seizing the production links at the right time" and introduced the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai Brigade's anti-drought struggle, overcoming the wrong thoughts of the brigade cadres and launching an anti-drought high tide. In areas with irrigation conditions, some community members and cadres thought there was water for irrigation and underestimated the development of the drought, failing to fully utilize water resources and irrigation equipment. After the combat teams mobilized them, they actively carried out ditch repairs and land leveling activities, expanding the irrigated area. In areas where cotton is widely planted, some people initially proposed to reduce the cotton fields. The combat teams mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres to jointly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "In making plans, doing work, and thinking about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has a population of 600 million and must never forget this point." Through study, they corrected the wrong thoughts of some community members and cadres and implemented the cotton planting area according to the state plan.

Each combat team's guidance according to local conditions played a significant role in comprehensively improving spring plowing. By the end of March, the county's spring irrigation area had reached over 100,000 mu, exceeding more than half of the same period last year. Cotton and autumn fields had been thoroughly plowed and weeded to preserve moisture two to three times. Over 13,000 mu of Dazhai-style farmland had been newly built, with progress and quantity exceeding the same period last year. In previous years, Xinxian often failed to complete the state plan for the planting area of cotton, oil crops, and hemp. This spring, the implementation was both early and smooth.

    忻县第一线指挥部因地制宜指导工作
    派出大批干部下乡抓革命促春耕
    帮助不同类型地区解决实际问题，全县革命生产蓬勃发展
    新华社太原十六日电　山西忻县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，分别派出抓革命促生产战斗队深入不同类型地区蹲点抓面，分区分类加强春耕生产第一线领导。指挥部在抓全县共同性生产活动的同时，具体帮助不同类型地区解决当地的实际问题，进一步促使全县革命、生产得到了蓬勃发展。
    忻县无产阶级革命派二月初夺权后，迅速成立了全县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。在领导工作中，他们认真学习了毛主席的教导：“任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”经过学习，大家进一步认识到各类地区情况不同，要有效地加强春耕生产第一线工作，必须因地制宜地进行领导。他们按照自然条件、政治基础、工作状况以及当前存在的问题等，把全县分为九个片，派出有八百多名干部参加的抓革命促生产战斗队，到这些地方去因地制宜地分别进行指导。革命领导干部以身作则，普遍亲临第一线，除了照顾面的工作，都固定有联系点。县武装部和当地驻军的大批干部和战士，也深入各类地区。各抓革命促生产战斗队都认真活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化。蹲点的队员，通过和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，进行调查研究，指导工作。指挥部为便利第一线工作，尽可能到第一线去传达上级指示，布置任务，并编印《战报》沟通各类地区情况。
    忻县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部实行分类指导的五十多天来，收到了良好效果。这个县去冬今春少雪缺雨，山区和丘陵区旱象较为严重，战斗队针对一部分队干部不重视抗旱工作的活思想，反复宣传毛主席“不失时机地掌握生产环节”的教导，介绍大寨大队抗旱斗争的革命精神，克服了队干部的错误思想，掀起了抗旱高潮。在有灌溉条件的地区，一部分社员和干部认为有水可浇，对旱象发展估计不足，没有充分发挥水利资源和水利设备的作用，经过战斗队的发动，也积极开展了修渠整地活动，扩大了受益面积。种棉花较多的地区，有些人开始错误地提出要缩减棉田。战斗队就发动贫下中农、干部共同学习毛主席的教导：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”经过学习，纠正了部分社员和干部的错误思想，按国家计划落实了棉田种植面积。
    各个战斗队因地制宜具体指导，对全面搞好春耕起了很大作用。到三月底，全县春浇面积已达十万多亩，超过了去年同期浇灌面积的一半以上。棉秋田已普遍耙耱保墒两至三次。新修建大寨式农田一万三千多亩，进度数量都超过去年同期。往年忻县的棉花、油料、大麻作物的种植面积常常完不成国家计划，今春落实得又早又顺当。
