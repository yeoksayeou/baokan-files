We have achieved some victories, and often receive praise from our leaders and the masses. In the face of such praise, the most important thing is to prevent the "complacency" character.

At the beginning of the spring planting season, our militia squad responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We had great determination and enthusiasm, took the lead in shouldering heavy burdens, and led the way in fighting tough battles. We became the advanced squad in the entire brigade. The leadership praised us, and the masses also commended us. Originally, praise is a driving force for progress, but due to our selfish thoughts, some comrades were burdened with the baggage of arrogance and complacency. Once this "baggage" is on our backs, retreat begins. During the previous application of fertilizer for the winter wheat, we fell behind the seventh squad. This fact deeply educated us. We repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to decline," fought against the "complacency" character, and regained our enthusiasm. After five or six days of struggle, we caught up with the seventh squad. Now, on the entire spring planting battlefield, everyone is racing ahead, striving to contribute more to spring planting. In this situation, we must be particularly vigilant against the "complacency" character and prevent it from gaining ground again.

Why do we need to be so vigilant against the "complacency" character? Because the "complacency" character is a roadblock to our continuous progress. Our revolutionary process is a process of struggling against difficulties, a process of "moving mountains." The spirit of Yu Gong moving mountains is needed every day and must be promoted in everything. Currently, we are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to grasp the revolution and promote spring planting. After a while, we will have to handle the summer harvest, followed by the autumn harvest. The tasks follow one after another, moving one mountain after another. This requires us to never be complacent and to always move forward. Only by constantly fighting against the "complacency" character and fully promoting the revolutionary spirit of progress can we continuously achieve new victories and carry the revolution through to the end.

### 防止“满”字

    防止“满”字
    民兵政治干事　吴礼准
    我们取得了一点胜利，往往会受到领导和群众的赞扬。在赞扬面前，最要紧的是防止“满”字。
    春耕生产开始的时候，我们排民兵坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，决心大，干劲足，带头挑重担，带头打硬仗，成为全大队的先进排，领导表扬我们，群众也赞扬我们。本来，表扬是前进的动力，但是由于我们有私心杂念，有些同志背上了骄傲自满的包袱。这种“包袱”一背上身，倒退就开始了。前次追施三麦返青肥，就掉到七排的后面了。事实深深地教育了我们，大家反复学习了“老三篇”和毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，同“满”字斗，重新鼓足了干劲，经过五、六天的奋战，我们又赶上第七排。现在，整个春耕生产的战场上，都在你追我赶，争着为春耕生产多出点力。在这种形势下，我们要特别警惕“满”字，不能让它重新得势。
    我们为什么要对“满”字这样警惕呢？因为“满”字是我们不断前进的拦路虎。我们干革命的过程，就是和困难作斗争的过程，也就是“移山”的过程；愚公移山的精神，天天用得着，事事要发扬。目前我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命促春耕，过一个时候就要搞夏收，接着又要搞秋收，任务一个接着一个，移了一山又一山，这就需要我们永不自满，永远前进。我们只有不断同“满”字斗，充分发扬革命的进取精神，才能不断取得新胜利，把革命进行到底。
