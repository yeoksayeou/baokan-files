Liaoning's urban and rural revolutionary masses are following Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production" and are currently launching a spring afforestation campaign. According to incomplete statistics from 21 cities and counties, including Dandong, Jinzhou, and Chaoyang, over 300,000 mu of land have already been afforested.

In this spring afforestation season, the revolutionary masses across various regions have revisited Chairman Mao's teachings on "forest cultivation and livestock breeding being important components of agriculture." They regard the afforestation work as a crucial measure to transform the natural landscape, boost agricultural production, and implement Chairman Mao's great strategic plan of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." The enthusiasm for planting trees and afforestation has reached an unprecedented level.

    辽宁突击进行春季造林工作
    辽宁城乡革命群众遵循毛主席“不失时机地掌握生产环节”的指示，正在突击进行春季造林。据丹东、锦州、朝阳等二十一个市、县的不完全统计，目前已造林三十多万亩。
    各地革命群众在春季造林季节，重温了毛主席关于“森林的培养，畜产的增殖，也是农业的重要部分”的教导，把搞好造林工作当做改造自然面貌，促进农业增产和实现毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针的一项重要措施，植树造林的积极性空前高涨。
