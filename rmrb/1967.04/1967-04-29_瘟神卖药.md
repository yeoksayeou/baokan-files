The U.S. Department of Commerce spokesman recently declared that the U.S. government, out of "humanitarian" considerations, has notified American drug merchants that they can sell some epidemic prevention medicines to China. Furthermore, it was specially stated that this is a "serious suggestion" and not "propaganda."

Oh, my goodness! The American imperialist big boss has suddenly become compassionate, caring about the health of the Chinese people. According to this, shouldn't the Chinese people be grateful? However, unfortunately, your "suggestion" is a bit too "serious," so people can see at a glance that this is a barefaced trick.

The claim that it is "not propaganda" is precisely "there is no silver here, three hundred taels." You are playing such petty tricks precisely for propaganda, and it is extremely malicious anti-China propaganda. You want to use this to show off your so-called "friendship" towards the Chinese people, to cover up your own ferocious and evil face of aggression, to dress up as a benevolent and kind-hearted person, and to deceive the people of the world. You also want to use this to spread rumors about the spread of diseases in China, to blacken the face of the Chinese people, and to stir up trouble between China and neighboring countries. Your intentions are extremely sinister.

The claim of acting out of "humanitarian" considerations is even more disgusting. The Chinese people and all the people of the world have had enough experience with American imperialism's "humanitarianism." You aided Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war, killing so many Chinese people, this is your "humanitarianism"! You launched the war of aggression against Korea and even conducted germ warfare, this is your "humanitarianism"! You implemented the "three noes" policy in South Vietnam and carried out massive bombing in North Vietnam, this is also your "humanitarianism"! You, the number one plague god, are now carrying a broken gourd to sell epidemic prevention medicines and singing about "humanitarianism," isn't this too shameless?

Chairman Mao has long pointed out, "The counter-revolutionary cause of the imperialist governments is done every day, but in words, in official documents, it is always full of righteousness and morality... never telling the truth." The bad nature of American imperialism will not change. However, in the face of the great Chinese people, any sweet talk, tricks, and deceit of American imperialism will never succeed. It can only further arouse our hatred, contempt, and ridicule of American imperialism. We warn the gentlemen in Washington to stop your tricks early!

    瘟神卖药
    美国商务部发言人最近宣称，美国政府出于“人道主义”考虑，已通知美国药商可以把一些防疫药品卖给中国，并且特别声明这是一个“认真的建议”，而不是“宣传”。
    哎呀呀，美帝国主义大老爷竟然大发慈悲，关心起中国人民的健康来了。照此说来，中国人民岂不是应该感激涕零吗？但是，可惜你们的“建议”未免过于“认真”了，因此人们一眼就可以看穿这是一个不折不扣的诡计。
    所谓“不是宣传”，恰恰是“此地无银三百两”。你们玩弄这种小花招，正是为了宣传，而且是十分恶毒的反华宣传。你们想借此卖弄你们对中国人民的所谓“友谊”，掩盖自己穷凶极恶的侵略面目，打扮成善长仁翁，欺骗世界人民。你们还想借此散布中国病疫流行的谣言，给中国人民脸上抹黑，并且挑拨中国同邻国的关系。这种用心可谓险恶已极。
    所谓出于“人道主义”的考虑，更是令人作呕。对于美帝国主义的“人道主义”，中国人民和全世界人民实在领教得够多了。你们援助蒋介石打内战，杀了那么多的中国人，这就是你们的“人道主义”！你们发动侵朝战争，并且搞了细菌战，这又是你们的“人道主义”！你们在越南南方实行“三光政策”，对越南北方狂轰滥炸，这也是你们的“人道主义”！……你们这个天字第一号的大瘟神，居然背上一个破葫芦卖起防疫药，还高唱什么“人道主义”，岂不是太无耻了吗！？
    毛主席早就指出，“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德……从来不说实话。”美帝国主义这种劣根性，是不会改变的。但是，在伟大的中国人民面前，美帝国主义的任何花言巧语，诡计骗术，装好心，做笑脸，等等花招，都是永远不会得逞的。它只能更加激起我们对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。正告华盛顿的老爷们，还是趁早收起你们这套鬼把戏吧！
