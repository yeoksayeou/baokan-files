Since April 20, American imperialism has taken serious steps to "escalate" the war in Vietnam. American bandit planes have continuously and on a large scale bombed the residential areas, industrial zones, airports, and ports of major cities such as Hanoi and Haiphong. The seven hundred million people of China vehemently denounce the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors in their frenzied expansion of the war in Vietnam.

Since American imperialism expanded the war in Vietnam to the North, over the past two years, it has repeatedly escalated the war. It has gradually expanded the bombing range to Hanoi and Haiphong. It bombs transportation lines, residential areas, industrial zones, ports, and airports, reaching a level of madness and barbarism.

For over two years, American imperialism has relentlessly focused on the single word "bomb." Sometimes it pretends to "stop bombing to lure peace," and sometimes it "pressures with bombs to force surrender." When one blackmail attempt fails, it escalates again, merely expanding the bombing range and dropping more bombs. To be honest, the American aggressors have no way to reverse their failing fortunes.

The word "bomb" not only reveals the madness of American imperialism but also reflects its weakness.

Since the beginning of this year, American imperialism has exhausted all its efforts, scrambling to launch a "second dry season offensive" in South Vietnam. The result is even more casualties and more severe defeats. In the first quarter of this year, the American aggressors and their lackeys were annihilated by the brave people of South Vietnam, with over eighty thousand casualties, including forty-five thousand American soldiers and mercenaries. At the same time, the fraudulent "peace talks" played by the American imperialists, such as "stop bombing to lure peace" and "force surrender with war," have all failed. They cannot win the war, and they cannot deceive anyone, so they have returned to the old path of escalating the war.

The more desperate the situation of American imperialism, the more eagerly the Soviet revisionist leadership serves it. When the Americans escalated the war again and launched large-scale bombings in North Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist deputy foreign minister Kuznetsov rushed to New York to hold secret talks with the American representative to the United Nations. The American representative said that secret diplomacy between the Soviet Union and the United States is "necessary for achieving (Vietnamese) peace." This Soviet revisionist diplomat also loudly declared in a special committee meeting of the United Nations that the Vietnam War is a "special danger" that causes "terror," helping the American aggressors to intimidate the Vietnamese people and using the smoke screen of peace talks to cover up the American war escalation. Look at this Soviet revisionist leadership, this accomplice of American imperialism, how sinister and vile, how base and shameless!

However, the Vietnamese people, who have been tempered by long battles, are never intimidated. The people of North Vietnam concentrate their hatred on the gun barrels, fiercely striking down the American bandits. From April 20 to 26, in just one week, they shot down dozens of invading American planes. The heroic Vietnamese people fight well, fight decisively, and fight satisfactorily!

American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the people of China and Vietnam. While taking serious steps to escalate the war in North Vietnam, it also launched a frenzied war provocation against our country. On the afternoon of the 24th, two F-4B type American fighter jets invaded the airspace over a certain area in Guangxi, China, and were immediately annihilated by our brave air force. On the 29th, an American unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft invaded our airspace and was shot down by our air force. This is the strong response of the Chinese people to the American imperialists' frenzied plot to expand the war of aggression. The people of China and Vietnam are forever the closest comrades-in-arms. The seven hundred million people of China resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression and national salvation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary force." The American aggressors' frenzied expansion of the war in Vietnam is precisely such a final struggle. They will surely meet with a catastrophic fate in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war!

    炸弹救不了美国侵略者
    本报评论员
    四月二十日以来，美帝国主义对越南北方又采取了严重的战争“升级”行动。美国强盗飞机连续地、大规模地轰炸了河内、海防等大城市的居民区、工业区、机场和港口。七亿中国人民愤怒声讨美国侵略者疯狂扩大侵越战争的滔天罪行。
    美帝国主义自从把侵越战争扩大到越南北方以来，两年多的期间，不断大搞战争“升级”。它把轰炸范围步步扩大，一直炸到河内、海防。它炸交通线，炸居民区，炸工业区，炸港口，炸机场，简直疯狂到了极点，野蛮到了极点。
    两年多来，美帝国主义翻来复去就在一个“炸”字上大做文章。一会儿“停炸诱和”，一会儿又“以炸压降”；这一次讹诈破产了，又来一次“升级”，无非就是炸的范围更加扩大，炸弹扔得更多一些。老实说，美国侵略者想要挽救它的失败命运的出路是没有的。
    一个“炸”字，既说明了美帝国主义的疯狂性，也反映了美帝国主义的虚弱性。
    今年以来，美帝国主义费尽九牛二虎的气力，东拼西凑地在越南南方搞了个“第二次旱季攻势”。其结果是更多地损兵折将，遭受到更加惨重的失败。在今年第一季度里，美国侵略军及其走狗，被英勇的越南南方军民歼灭了八万多名，其中美国侵略军和帮凶军达四万五千多名。与此同时，美帝国主义猖狂玩弄的“停炸诱和”、“以战迫降”的“和谈”骗局，也连连破产。它打又打不赢，骗也骗不成，又走上了战争“升级”的老路。
    美帝国主义处境越狼狈，苏修领导集团就越卖劲地为它效劳。在美国再一次进行战争“升级”，对越南北方进行大规模轰炸的时候，苏修副外长库兹?佐夫匆忙赶到纽约，同美国驻联合国代表进行密谈。美国代表说，苏美之间的秘密外交，是“实现（越南）和平所必需的”。苏修的这个外交大员还在联合国特别委员会的会议上，竭力叫嚷越南战争是使人“惊恐”的“特殊危险”，帮着美国侵略强盗来吓唬越南人民，并且用和谈烟幕来掩护美国的战争“升级”。请看苏修领导集团这个美帝国主义的帮凶，是多么阴险毒辣，多么卑鄙无耻！
    但是，久经战斗锻炼的越南人民，是永远吓不倒的。越南北方军民把仇恨凝聚在枪口上，狠揍美国飞贼，从四月二十日到二十六日的一周内，打落了数十架入侵的美国飞机。英雄的越南人民打得好，打得干脆，打得痛快！
    美帝国主义是中越两国人民不共戴天的死敌。它在对越南北方采取严重战争“升级”步骤的同时，也对我国进行了疯狂的战争挑衅。二十四日下午，两架Ｆ—4Ｂ型美国战斗机入侵我国广西某地上空，当即被我英勇空军部队一举全歼。二十九日，美国的一架无人驾驶高空侦察机侵入我国领空，又被我空军部队击落。这就是中国人民对于美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略战争阴谋的强有力的回答。中越两国人民永远是并肩战斗的最亲密的战友。七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美国侵略者疯狂扩大侵越战争，就是这样的一种最后挣扎。它在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中，必将遭到灭顶之灾！
