Recently, from April 14 to April 22, U.S. imperialism hastily convened a series of meetings in Washington, including the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Military Advisors Conference and the Ministerial Council Meeting, the Seven-Party Meeting of the U.S. and its Vietnamese War Allies, and the U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Group Meeting.

In just nine days, four black meetings were held. What exactly were they up to? From the information that has been disclosed, it can be seen that the purpose of these black meetings is to expand the Vietnam War as the core, and to adjust and strengthen the U.S. aggression deployment in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia.

Accelerating the Preparation for the Expansion of the Vietnam War

At the Guam meeting, the U.S. imperialists decided to further expand the Vietnam War. They plan to direct their attacks in two directions. One direction is to increase military pressure on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, cross the 17th parallel, and expand the ground war to North Vietnam. Recently, in addition to withdrawing a large number of main forces from South and Central Vietnam and concentrating them on the southern side of the so-called demilitarized zone, the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, rushed back to Washington to demand an additional 100,000 troops, showing a posture of wanting to launch a major offensive.

On the other hand, the U.S. also plans to expand the war to Laos and Cambodia. U.S. officials have declared that they want to open fronts in Laos and Cambodia and blockade the western border of South Vietnam. According to the Cambodian weekly "Nationalist," the Pentagon has already formulated a plan to invade the liberated areas of Cambodia and Laos.

To accelerate the expansion of the war of aggression, B-52 strategic bombers have recently been deployed to Thailand. At the same time, the U.S. is hastily building strategic roads in areas near the Cambodian and Laotian borders within Thailand and is working day and night to build a large logistics base in the area of Sattahip near Bangkok Bay. McNamara also announced that the U.S. military "aid" to Thailand and Laos in the future will be directly included in the U.S. defense budget, just like the military "aid" to the South Vietnamese puppet regime. All of this indicates that U.S. imperialism has already included the entire Indochina and Thailand in a unified operational plan.

The U.S. is increasingly bogged down in the Vietnam War and faces numerous difficulties. As the war expands, these difficulties become even more severe. Since its forces are tied down in various parts of the world, it is unable to significantly increase its troops in South Vietnam. At the same time, its European allies are preoccupied with their own problems and are indifferent to this war of aggression. The Johnson administration, which has lost its way and lacks support, can only rely on its few puppets and lackeys in Asia to maintain its facade.

At the black meetings held in Washington, the U.S. called for a "firm and long-term" continuation of the Vietnam War to drive its lackeys and puppets to continue to fight in this war of aggression. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council's communiqué declared that its members would "increase support" for the Vietnam War "to the extent possible." The communiqué of the Seven-Party Meeting on Vietnam also declared that they would "make efforts in the military and all other aspects" to continue the Vietnam War.

The U.S. is becoming increasingly isolated in the Vietnam War. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has long been in a state of disintegration and paralysis. Even the Thai Foreign Minister lamented that this organization of aggression is almost a "useless corpse." The Johnson administration, helpless, decided at this Washington meeting to cobble together a so-called "appropriate organization composed of seven countries" to stabilize its aggression front in Southeast Asia.

Desperately Patching Up the Anti-China Encirclement

U.S. imperialism is terrified and hates the great Chinese people, the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the great Chinese Cultural Revolution. They are extremely afraid that after thoroughly uprooting the roots of revisionism, our Cultural Revolution will greatly promote the new and vigorous development of socialist construction, making our country even stronger, more consolidated, and more powerful in supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is even more frantic in its opposition to China.

The series of meetings held by the U.S. in Washington were aimed at accelerating the Vietnam War and also at patching up its anti-China encirclement in Asia.

With the support and cooperation of the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. has gradually moved its military forces eastward in recent years, intensifying the suppression of the surging national liberation struggles in Asia, and actively cobbling together a new crescent-shaped military encirclement from Japan and South Korea to Southeast Asia, directing its spearhead at China, which firmly supports the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries in the world.

The U.S. imperialists, disregarding the opposition of countries such as Pakistan, used the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Ministerial Council Meeting to shout about the "main threat" of "Communist aggression" in Southeast Asia. The U.S. and its lackeys have repeatedly maliciously slandered China as "war-mongering" and a "danger to world security." The U.S. military and political leaders have even more blatantly announced that the main target of the U.S. is to carry out "strategic deterrence" against China. The seven-aggression organizations decided at this meeting, in addition to stabilizing the U.S. aggression front in Southeast Asia, have another purpose, which is to use the South Korean puppet regime to link the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with the de facto existing Northeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Before and after these meetings, the U.S. also intensified its collusion with the Japanese reactionaries, the backbone of the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization. In early April, the U.S. and the Japanese Navy held the largest-scale exercises since the war. It is reported that the Japanese Navy and the South Korean puppet Navy will also hold joint exercises soon. In May, the U.S. and Japan will hold talks to discuss the "military situation in the Far East" and the "Vietnam and China issues."

It is worth noting that the U.S. and its lackeys have recently greatly strengthened their activities in Taiwan. In addition to U.S. officials frequently visiting Taiwan to plot conspiracies, the Thai Prime Minister Thanom and the Australian Prime Minister Holt have also successively visited Taiwan. Thanom also discussed with the Chiang Kai-shek clique the possibility of "military cooperation" between the two sides and plotted to pull the Chiang clique into the Southeast Asia military bloc.

All of this indicates that the U.S. not only wants to further expand the Vietnam War but also is doing its utmost to patch up a deep and multi-layered anti-China encirclement. Its arrogant ambitions cannot but arouse the serious attention and vigilance of the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the revolutionary people of various countries in Asia.

Heading Towards Complete Failure

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces that are about to perish will inevitably make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The U.S. imperialists held a series of meetings in Washington to plot the expansion of the Vietnam War and strengthen their aggression in Asia, which is precisely such a desperate struggle.

Recently, good news has been frequently reported from the Vietnam battlefield. The Vietnamese people are fighting stronger and stronger, their fighting spirit is more vigorous, and their confidence in victory is stronger. The anti-imperialist struggles of the people of various countries in Asia are surging. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has unprecedentedly strengthened our power, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is invincibly powerful, and the great Mao Zedong Thought is spreading its influence around the world.

The situation in Vietnam is excellent, and the situation in Asia and the world is excellent. Although the U.S. is struggling desperately, the forces it can muster are extremely pitiful. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting, France refused to participate; Pakistan stated that the communiqué does not represent its position. The four meetings, running around, are mainly just a few lackeys and running dogs. Those who are determined to sell out to the U.S. are only puppets like Thailand and South Korea, which rely entirely on the U.S. bayonets to maintain their rule. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to rely on them to reverse the Vietnam defeat and improve their situation in Asia only proves that they are already in a desperate situation.

### 警惕美帝在亚洲的新侵略阴谋

    警惕美帝在亚洲的新侵略阴谋
    最近，从四月十四日到四月二十二日，美帝国主义在华盛顿匆匆忙忙地连续召开了东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议和部长理事会议、美帝和侵越帮凶的七家会议以及美澳新集团会议。
    九天之内，四个黑会，究竟搞了些什么名堂呢？从已透露的情况可以看出，这些黑会的目的，是以扩大侵越战争为核心，调整和加强美帝在亚洲，特别是在东南亚的侵略部署。
    加紧准备扩大侵越战争
    美帝国主义在关岛黑会上定下了进一步扩大侵越战争的方针。它准备把矛头指向两个方面。一个方面是，对越南民主共和国进一步加强军事压力，越过十七度线，把地面战争扩大到越南北方。最近，美国侵略者除了从南越南部和中部地区抽调了大批主力部队，集结于所谓非军事区南侧之外，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰还跑回华盛顿，要求增兵十万，摆出一副要大打的架势。
    另一方面，美帝还准备把战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。美国官员叫嚣，要在老挝和柬埔寨开辟战线，封锁南越西部边界。据柬埔寨《民族主义者》周刊揭露，五角大楼已经制定入侵柬埔寨和老挝下寮解放区的计划。
    为了加紧扩大侵略战争，不久前，B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国。同时，美帝正在泰国境内靠近柬、老边界的地区赶修战略公路，并在曼谷湾的梭桃邑一带，日夜施工，修建大型后勤基地。麦克纳马拉还宣布，美国今后对泰国和老挝的军事“援助”将同对南越傀儡的军事“援助”一样，直接列入美国的国防预算。这一切都表明，美帝国主义已经把整个印度支那和泰国纳入统一的作战计划。
    美帝在侵越战争中，越陷越深，困难重重。随着战争的扩大，这些困难就更加严重。由于它的兵力被牵制在世界各地，动弹不得，要大规模增兵南越，力不从心。同时它的欧洲盟国自顾不暇，对这场侵略战争，十分冷淡。失道寡助的约翰逊政府，只能依靠它在亚洲的几个傀儡、仆从来支撑场面。
    在华盛顿举行的黑会中，美帝叫嚷要“坚定、长久”地进行侵越战争，来驱使它的仆从、傀儡继续为这场侵略战争卖命。东南亚集团理事会公报叫嚷它的成员“在可能的情况下”，增加对侵越战争的“支持”。侵越七家会议的公报也叫嚷，它们要为继续进行侵越战争“在军事方面和所有其他方面作出努力”。
    美帝在侵越战争中的处境越来越孤立了。东南亚集团早已分崩离析，处于瘫痪状态。连泰国外长也哀叹这个侵略集团几乎等于是一具“无用的僵尸”。约翰逊政府无可奈何，在这次华盛顿黑会中，它又决定要拼凑一个所谓“由七国代表组成的适当的组织”，来稳住它在东南亚的侵略阵脚。
    拚命修补反华包围圈
    美帝国主义对伟大的中国人民，对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们非常害怕我国文化大革命在彻底挖掉修正主义根子之后，将大大推动社会主义建设的新的蓬勃发展，使我国变得更加强大，更加巩固，更加有力地支援世界人民的革命斗争。因此，美帝国主义更加疯狂地反对中国。
    美国在华盛顿召开的一系列会议的目的，是为了加紧侵越战争，同时也是为了修补它在亚洲的反华包围圈。
    在苏修的配合和支持下，美帝近年来逐步把军事力量东移，加紧镇压亚洲风起云涌的民族解放斗争，并且积极拼凑一个从日本、南朝鲜直到东南亚的所谓新月形的军事包围圈，把矛头指向坚决支持越南人民和世界各国人民革命斗争的中国。
    美帝国主义不顾巴基斯坦等国的反对，利用东南亚条约组织部长理事会议，叫嚷什么“共产党侵略”是东南亚的“主要威胁”。美国及其仆从还一再恶毒诽谤中国“好战”，是对“世界安全最危险的威胁”。美国的军政头目更露骨地宣布，美国的主要目标，是要对中国进行“战略抑制”。这次会议决定建立的侵越七家侵略机构，除了要稳住美帝在东南亚的侵略阵脚之外，还有一个目的，就是要通过南朝鲜傀儡当局，把东南亚集团和实际上已经存在的东北亚集团挂起钩来。
    在这些会议前后，美帝还同东北亚集团的骨干日本反动派加紧勾结。四月上旬，美帝和日本海军举行了战后以来规模最大的演习。据报道，日本海军和南朝鲜傀儡海军不久也将举行联合演习。五月间，美、日将举行会谈，讨论“远东军事形势”和“越南、中国问题”。
    值得注意的是，美帝及其仆从最近在台湾的活动也大大加强了。除了美帝官员不断到台湾策划阴谋之外，泰国总理他侬和澳大利亚总理霍尔特不久前也相继去台湾“访问”。他侬还同蒋匪帮研究了双方“军事合作”的可能性问题，并且阴谋把蒋匪帮拉进东南亚军事集团。
    这一切表明，美国不仅要进一步扩大侵越战争，而且竭尽全力修补纵深的、多层次的反华包围圈。它的狂妄野心，不能不引起中国人民、越南人民和亚洲各国革命人民严重的注意和警惕。
    走向彻底失败
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义在华盛顿召开一连串会议，策划扩大侵越战争和加强在亚洲的侵略活动，就是这样一种绝望的挣扎。
    最近，越南战场捷报频传，越南人民越战越强，越打战斗意志越旺盛，胜利的信心越足。亚洲各国人民反帝斗争的浪潮日益高涨。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，空前地增强了我们的力量，英勇的中国人民解放军，无比强大，伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界的影响不断扩大。
    越南是一片大好形势，亚洲和全世界是一片大好形势。尽管美帝疯狂挣扎，但它所能纠集的力量，是十分可怜的。东南亚集团开会，法国拒绝参加；巴基斯坦声明，会议公报并不代表它的立场。四个会议，窜来跳去，主要地不过是那么几个仆从和走狗。死心塌地为美国卖命的，无非是象泰国、南朝鲜那些完全靠美国刺刀维持统治的傀儡而已。美帝国主义妄想依靠它们挽回侵越败局和改善在亚洲的处境，适足以证明它已经处于日暮途穷的绝境。
