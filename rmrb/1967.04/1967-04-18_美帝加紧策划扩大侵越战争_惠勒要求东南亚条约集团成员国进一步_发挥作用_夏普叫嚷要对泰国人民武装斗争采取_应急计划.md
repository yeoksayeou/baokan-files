The U.S. empire is hurrying to plot the expansion of the invasion of Vietnam. Wheeler demands that the member countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization further "play their roles." Sharp clamors for an "emergency plan" against the armed struggle of the Thai people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 16th: Washington news: The U.S. imperialist-controlled Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held a two-day military advisory meeting in Washington from the 14th to the 15th. News leaked during the meeting indicates that this military bloc's hegemon, U.S. imperialism, after convening the Kadan Black Meeting, is planning to further utilize this already paralyzed military organization to help it expand the invasion of Vietnam.

The member countries of this aggressive military bloc, Pakistan and France, did not participate in the meeting.

The two-day military advisory meeting of this aggressive bloc was a preparation for the council meeting of this bloc scheduled to be held from the 18th to the 20th. In his opening remarks at the meeting, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler advocated that "it is time for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to play its role" in the U.S. invasion of Vietnam.

The communiqué issued after the meeting also exposed the U.S. imperialists' sinister intentions. The communiqué praised the "contributions" made by some member countries of this bloc to the U.S. invasion of Vietnam and demanded that they continue their efforts.

The communiqué also stated that the meeting, based on the current "threats," studied the "defense arrangements of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and "reached an agreement" to "more frequently study the situation." At a press conference held after the meeting, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Armed Forces Sharp said that the participants of the meeting "discussed with considerable concern the increasingly serious rebellion in northeastern Thailand" and the various "emergency plans" that might be needed.

    据新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义控制的东南亚条约组织，十四日到十五日在华盛顿举行了两天军事顾问会议。会议期间透露的消息表明，这个军事集团的盟主美帝国主义在召开关岛黑会后，正打算进一步利用这个已经陷于瘫痪状态的军事集团帮助它扩大侵越战争。
    这个集团的成员国巴基斯坦和法国没有参加会议。
    这个侵略性军事集团的两天军事顾问会议，是为定于十八日到二十日举行的这个集团的理事会会议作准备的。美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒在会上作的开幕词里鼓吹说，在美国侵越战争中，“现在是东南亚条约组织发挥作用的时候了”。
    会后发表的公报也暴露了美帝国主义的这种罪恶打算。公报夸奖这个集团的某些成员国对美国侵越战争作出的“贡献”，并且要求它们继续作出努力。
    公报还说，会议根据目前的“威胁”研究了“东南亚条约组织目前的防务安排”，并且“达成协议”要“更经常地研究局势”。美国太平洋武装部队总司令夏普在会后举行的记者招待会上说，会议参加者“怀着相当忧虑的心情，讨论了泰国东北部的越来越厉害的叛乱”和可能需要的各种“应急计划”。
