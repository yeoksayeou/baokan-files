How can we make greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and more excellently accomplish the glorious tasks entrusted to the People's Liberation Army by the great leader Chairman Mao, such as supporting the broad leftist masses, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture? Recently, the broad cadres and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command and the units stationed in Beijing have conducted a mass activity to summarize experiences from the bottom up. They have deeply felt from practice that political and ideological support is the greatest and most fundamental support; believing in the masses and relying on the masses is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job; and setting an example in struggle is the most effective way to spread Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command and the units stationed in Beijing have, since late January, followed the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao with the greatest enthusiasm and highest initiative, successively gone deep into factories and rural areas, and shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to seize the revolution and promote production. They have achieved remarkable results and gained rich experience in completing this new combat mission.

Emphasize politics, treat political and ideological work as the foundation of the entire support work, and treat Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of the entire support work.

Once the cadres and soldiers arrived at the frontline of the fierce struggle, various revolutionary mass organizations and the broad masses came to them, asking them to solve this or that problem. From how to implement the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, how to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, to how to "seize the revolution and promote production"; from minor issues such as disputes among the masses and specific problems in administrative work, etc. All kinds of problems were numerous and complex. How should these problems be handled? Should they be dealt with one by one as they arise, or should they focus on the fundamentals and provide political and ideological support?

Comrade Lin Biao said: The work situation is indeed complex, with various different situations, but in this regard, it is both complex and not complex, both different and not different, that is, all should be unified with Mao Zedong Thought. Many cadres and soldiers, based on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, firmly grasped the key to arming the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and seriously helped them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, to correctly grasp the party's policies, and to enhance their revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline. The cadres and soldiers of the unit stationed in Huairou, together with the Huairou County People's Armed Forces Department, helped the local revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to establish a command center on the production frontline. The masses put forward many demands and there were many things to do. Faced with the complex tasks, the cadres and soldiers did not waver. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and first of all, they vigorously promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works and political and ideological work. They quickly established political work institutions from the county, commune to the production team, restored the system of political instructors, held special meetings to discuss the study of Chairman Mao's works, and quickly launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county. The broad revolutionary masses were full of spirit and high morale, and they fought a powerful battle for spring plowing and production. Many problems in the work were also solved. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The PLA brought us the voice of Chairman Mao, the policies of the Party, and the power of revolution." "The PLA did it well, hitting the key point."

How can we help the revolutionary leftists to truly master Mao Zedong Thought? Many cadres and soldiers believe that they must guide them to study in the fierce and complex class struggle and use it in the fierce and complex class struggle, and vigorously grasp and solve various real ideological problems with Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers who went to a certain machinery factory in Beijing found that a unit's workers formed many revolutionary organizations. Although these organizations had the same general direction, they fought separately in the struggle and did not cooperate with each other. Why couldn't they implement the great alliance according to administrative departments like the Guiyang Cotton Mill? The cadres and soldiers, after investigation and research, believed that the fundamental problem was that these revolutionary masses had the word "self" in their minds, and they must, as the revolutionary youngsters proposed, seize the power of the "self" in their minds while seizing the power of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Therefore, they studied with these revolutionary masses Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and inspired them to open-door rectification, taking "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as the standard, to carry out criticism and self-criticism in the depths of their souls. After studying, the revolutionary masses dug out the "self" in the depths of their thoughts. They said: "When 'self' is in charge, one's mind is confused; when 'public' is in command, one is invincible." Without the great alliance of the revolution, there is no great march of the revolution. After uniting, they constantly brought problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to solve various real problems, and in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, their combat effectiveness was greatly enhanced, and they achieved one victory after another.

Believe in the masses and rely on the masses, humbly be the masses' students, and let the masses liberate themselves.

When the broad cadres and soldiers arrived at the frontline of the fierce struggle, the revolutionary masses enthusiastically welcomed them with drums and gongs, and many people placed their hopes for victory in the struggle on the support of the troops. In the situation where the masses had unlimited trust, what should be done? Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." Some units, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, raised such a sharp question: Should we believe in the masses or believe in ourselves? Should we truly regard the revolutionary masses as heroes or regard the revolutionary masses as "A Dou"? The cadres and soldiers opened their minds, touched their souls, and launched a struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Many leading cadres said: At first glance, it seemed that they could believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and solve the problem of walking the mass line. But when they dug deep into their souls, they found that there was still the word "self" in their minds, believing in themselves more than believing in the masses, and they still could not truly regard the masses as heroes. They believed that this fundamental problem must be solved, otherwise, as soon as they arrived at factories and rural areas, they would start giving orders and taking charge. Their slogan was: Believing in the masses or not, relying on the masses or not, walking the mass line or not, is the dividing line between implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, and is the touchstone to distinguish the proletarian worldview from the bourgeois worldview.

When they arrived at factories and communes, did they really go deep into the frontline? This was the first question the cadres and soldiers had to solve. As soon as they entered the factory or commune, the broad masses swarmed to them. If they sat in the office listening to reports and giving instructions, they could be busy all day. The cadres and soldiers believed that this could not be regarded as truly going deep into the frontline. The cadres and soldiers who went to a certain factory on the first day of their entry found a series of problems: the bourgeois reactionary line had not been thoroughly criticized, the poison of counter-revolutionary economism had not been eliminated, several revolutionary organizations were opposed to each other, and the order of revolution and production was temporarily in chaos. They did not satisfy themselves with listening to reports in the office but first went among the masses, held meetings with the masses, labored with the masses, had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, read big-character posters, listened to debates, and obtained rich sensory knowledge and a large amount of first-hand materials. In this way, they not only closely connected with the masses but also found the main contradictions from a large number of facts. Then, they mobilized the masses to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, promoted the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists, established a temporary leading body to seize the revolution and promote production, and both revolution and production presented a new situation.

The cadres and soldiers believed that going among the masses did not mean believing in the masses and relying on the masses. They must pay great attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses, humbly being the masses' students, consulting with the masses on matters, and letting the masses educate and liberate themselves. The cadres and soldiers who went to the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory, in the face of a large number of complex problems, followed Chairman Mao's teachings that "we have always advocated that the revolution should rely on the people, everyone should take action, and opposed relying only on a few people to issue orders," and went deep into the workshops and offices, consulted with the masses, and let everyone come up with ideas and solutions. After full discussion, the masses put forward many valuable suggestions. The masses' own suggestions, when executed by the masses themselves, could truly solve problems. A temporary leading body to seize the revolution and promote production, which was urgently needed, was quickly established.

Chairman Mao taught us that communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. We must take root, bloom, and bear fruit among the people. The cadres and soldiers followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, in the process of mobilizing the masses, paid great attention to passing on the good thoughts, good style, and good experiences of the troops' mass line to the revolutionary masses, helping the masses to truly understand Chairman Mao's mass line, and helping the masses to truly learn to educate and liberate themselves. When they found that some leading bodies and responsible persons of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and revolutionary organizations were not good at listening to the opinions of the masses and mobilizing the masses, and that work relied on a few people, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line on the one hand, and on the other hand, they set an example by consulting with the masses on everything, influencing them with their model actions, so that these revolutionary pioneers who had grown up in the class struggle could firmly believe in the masses, consult with the masses on matters, and truly achieve going to the masses and coming from the masses, gathering the opinions of the masses, and persevering in them.

Only by first setting an example of being loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao can we accomplish the arduous tasks entrusted to us by history.

The cadres and soldiers deeply felt that the power of example is boundless. Only by first setting an example of being loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, of studying and defending Mao Zedong Thought, can we truly gain the trust of the broad masses and successfully accomplish the arduous tasks of supporting the broad leftist masses, supporting industrial and agricultural production.

Setting an example for the masses, the most important thing is to set an example of being loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the struggle between the two lines. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit who supported spring plowing production in Zhao Xin Dian Production Brigade found that some cadres who had been removed from their positions during the "Four Cleanups" movement had colluded with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to spread malicious rumors, set off ghost fires, and attack revolutionary leftist mass organizations, attempting to achieve capitalist restoration. In the face of difficulties for the revolutionary leftists, the cadres and soldiers stood up, exposed the enemy's plots, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly defeated the enemy's counterattack and defended the achievements of the "Four Cleanups." Poor and lower-middle peasants said: The PLA is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, has clear hatred and love, and has a firm stand. They are always our good examples to learn from.

The cadres and soldiers also paid special attention to setting an example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, setting an example of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and setting an example of revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline. As soon as they arrived at factories and rural areas, they put down their bags and worked, studied, and fought with the workers and peasants. They always took the heavy burdens, gave the convenience to the masses, and left the difficulties to themselves, and quickly established a deep class sentiment with the revolutionary masses. No matter how busy the work was, the cadres and soldiers insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on daily reading and using them everywhere, making sure that their hands did not leave Chairman Mao's books, their mouths did not leave Chairman Mao's words, their hearts did not leave Mao Zedong Thought, and their actions did not leave Chairman Mao's teachings. At the study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works, they took the lead in "exposing" their thoughts and fighting selfishness, and used high standards to strictly demand of themselves. In implementing the party's policies, they were firm and meticulous. In all activities, they always carried forward traditions, brought style, and set an example of obeying discipline. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres saw the actions of the cadres and soldiers, remembered them in their hearts, and followed their example. They said: "The actions of the PLA are our good examples to learn from!" "In the past, we only heard that the PLA studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well. Now we have seen it with our own eyes. Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once, and seeing once is not as good as doing it oneself."

    政治思想上的支援是最重要最根本的支援
    ——北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队支持左派广大群众的体会
    怎样才能为无产阶级文化大革命作出更大的贡献，更出色地完成伟大领袖毛主席交给人民解放军的支持左派广大群众、支援工业、支援农业等项光荣任务？最近，人民解放军北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队广大指战员，从下到上开展了群众性的总结经验活动。他们从实践中深刻地体会到：政治思想上的支援，是最大最根本的支援；相信群众，依靠群众，是做好工作的根本保证；在斗争中做好榜样，是传播毛泽东思想最有效的方法。
    人民解放军北京卫戍区和驻京部队的广大指战员，是一月下旬遵循伟大领袖毛主席的指示，以最大的热忱，最高的积极性，陆续深入工厂农村，和广大革命群众、革命干部并肩抓革命、促生产的。他们在完成这个新的战斗任务中，取得了显著的成绩，获得了丰富的经验。
    突出政治，把政治思想工作当作全盘支援工作的基础，把毛泽东思想当作全部支援工作的灵魂
    指战员们一到火热斗争的第一线，各个革命群众组织和广大群众就来找他们要求解决这个那个问题。大至如何实行无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，如何肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，怎样“抓革命，促生产”；小至群众之间的纠纷，行政工作中的具体问题等等。各种各样的问题千头万绪，错综复杂。对待这些问题应当怎么办？是就事论事，遇到什么解决什么，还是抓根本，抓政治思想的支援？
    林彪同志说：工作情况虽然很复杂，有各种不同的情况，但在这一点上，又复杂又不复杂，又有差别又没有差别，这就是都要用毛泽东思想统一起来。许多指战员根据林彪同志的指示，紧紧抓住用毛泽东思想武装革命群众的头脑这条纲，认真帮助他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，正确掌握党的方针政策，提高他们的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。驻怀柔部队指战员和怀柔县人民武装部，在帮助当地革命干部、革命群众建立起生产第一线指挥部以后，群众向他们提出了许多要求，要做的事情很多。在复杂的任务面前，指战员们没有转向，他们牢记毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，首先就大抓毛主席著作的学习，大抓政治思想工作。他们从县、公社到生产队，迅速建立了政治工作机构，恢复了政治辅导员的制度，召开了专门讨论学习毛主席著作问题的会议，在全县迅速掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。广大革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，有力地打响春耕生产第一炮，工作中的许多问题也迎刃而解。贫下中农说：“解放军给我们带来了毛主席的声音，带来了党的政策，带来了革命的动力。”“解放军抓得好，抓住了关键，抓到了点子上。”
    怎样才能帮助无产阶级革命派把毛泽东思想真正学到手？许多指战员认为，必须引导他们在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中学，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中用，大抓狠抓活思想，不断用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种现实思想问题。到北京某机械厂的指战员，发现有个单位的职工组成了许多革命组织，这些组织大方向虽然一致，但是在斗争中你打你的，我打我的，互相不配合。为什么不能象贵阳棉纺厂那样实行按行政部门的大联合？指战员们经过调查研究认为，根本问题是这些革命群众头脑里有“私”字，必须象革命小将提出的那样，在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，夺头脑里“私”字的权。于是，他们便和这些革命群众一起学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，启发他们开门整风，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务作为标准，在灵魂深处闹革命，开展批评和自我批评。经过学习，革命群众挖了思想深处的“私”字。他们说：“私”字当家，头昏眼花；“公”字挂帅，百战不败。没有革命的大联合，就没有革命的大进军。他们联合起来以后，不断带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想解决各种现实问题，在斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和批判资产阶级反动路线中，战斗力大大加强，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    相信群众依靠群众，虚心当群众的小学生，让群众自己解放自己
    广大指战员到火热的斗争第一线，革命群众敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎，许多人把斗争的胜利寄托在部队的支援上。在群众无限信赖的情况下，应当怎么办？毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”有的部队根据毛主席的教导，提出了这样一个尖锐的问题：是相信群众，还是相信自己？是把革命群众真正当成英雄，还是把革命群众当成“阿斗”？指战员们敞开思想，触及灵魂，展开了一场破私立公的战斗。许多领导干部说：乍一想，觉得自己能相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线的问题解决了。从灵魂深处一挖就发现自己头脑里还有“私”字，相信自己还多于相信群众，还不能把群众真正当成英雄。他们认为，这个根本问题必须解决，否则一到厂矿农村，就会下车伊始，指手划脚，包办代替。他们的口号是：相信不相信群众，依靠不依靠群众，走不走群众路线，是贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线还是执行资产阶级反动路线的分水岭，是区别无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的试金石。
    到了工厂、公社，是不是就算深入了第一线？这是指战员们首先要解决的问题。他们一进厂、进社，广大群众蜂涌而来，如果坐在办公室里听汇报、作指示，每天可以忙得不可开交。指战员们认为，这并不能算真正的深入到第一线。到某厂的指战员下厂第一天，就碰到一系列问题：资产阶级反动路线没有彻底批判，反革命经济主义的流毒没有肃清，几个革命组织互相对立，革命和生产秩序一时有些乱。他们没有满足于坐在办公室里听汇报，而是首先到群众之中，和群众一起开会，劳动，谈心，看大字报，听辩论，取得了丰富的感性知识，掌握了大量的第一手材料。这样，既密切联系了群众，又从大量事实中找到了主要矛盾。然后，他们就发动群众彻底批判资产阶级反动路线和反革命经济主义的流毒，促进了革命派的大联合，建立了抓革命促生产的临时领导班子，革命和生产都出现了崭新的局面。
    指战员们认为，到了群众之中，并不就算是相信了群众，依靠了群众。必须十分注意倾听群众的意见，十分尊重群众的首创精神，虚心当群众的小学生，遇事和群众商量，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。到北京内燃机配件厂的指战员，在错综复杂的大量问题面前，遵照毛主席“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令”的教导，深入到车间、科室，和群众一起商量，让大家出主意，想办法。经过充分讨论，群众提出了许多宝贵的建议。群众自己的建议，自己去执行，就能真正解决问题。一个急需建立的抓革命促生产的临时领导班子，很快就建立起来了。
    毛主席教导我们，共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地，我们要在人民中间生根、开花。指战员们遵循毛主席的教导，在发动群众的过程中，十分注意把部队走群众路线的好思想、好作风、好经验传给革命群众，帮助群众真正理解毛主席的群众路线，帮助群众真正学会自己教育自己、自己解放自己。当他们发现有些革命的“三结合”的领导班子和革命组织的负责人，不善于倾听群众意见，不善于发动群众，工作靠少数人干的时候，一面组织大家学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导，一面以身作则，处处和群众商量，以模范行动影响他们，使这些在阶级斗争中成长起来的革命闯将能坚定地相信群众，遇事和群众商量，真正做到从群众中来，到群众中去，把群众的意见集中起来，坚持下去。
    只有首先做忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的好榜样，才能完成历史赋予我们的艰巨任务
    指战员们深刻地体会到，榜样的力量是无穷的。只有自己首先做无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的好样板，做学习、捍卫毛泽东思想的好榜样，才能真正得到广大群众的信赖，胜利完成支持左派广大群众，支援工业、农业生产的艰巨任务。
    做群众的好榜样，最主要的是要在两条路线的斗争中，做忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的好榜样。在赵辛店生产大队支援春耕生产的某部指战员，发现在“四清”运动中下台的一些干部，与地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起，煽阴风，点鬼火，围攻革命左派群众组织，妄图实现资本主义复辟。在革命左派面临困难的情况下，指战员们挺身而出，戳穿了敌人的阴谋，和广大革命群众一起彻底打垮了阶级敌人的反扑，保卫了“四清”成果。贫下中农说：解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，爱憎分明，立场坚定，永远是我们学习的好榜样。
    指战员还特别注意做活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样，做破私立公的好榜样，做革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的好榜样。他们一来到工厂、农村，背包一放，就和工农群众一起劳动，一起学习，一起革命，一起战斗。处处挑重担子，把方便让给群众，把困难留给自己，很快和革命群众建立了深厚的阶级感情。不管工作多忙，指战员们都坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持天天读，处处用，做到手不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，心不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的教导。在学习毛主席著作讲用会上带头“亮”思想，斗私心，以高标准来严格要求自己。在执行党的方针政策时，坚定认真，一丝不苟。在一切活动中，处处传传统，带作风，做遵守纪律的模范。广大革命群众和革命干部对指战员们的行动，看在眼里，记在心上，跟着学习，立竿见影。他们说：“解放军的行动，是我们学习的好样板！”“过去只听说解放军活学活用毛主席著作好，现在亲眼看到了，百闻不如一见，一见不如跟着干。”
