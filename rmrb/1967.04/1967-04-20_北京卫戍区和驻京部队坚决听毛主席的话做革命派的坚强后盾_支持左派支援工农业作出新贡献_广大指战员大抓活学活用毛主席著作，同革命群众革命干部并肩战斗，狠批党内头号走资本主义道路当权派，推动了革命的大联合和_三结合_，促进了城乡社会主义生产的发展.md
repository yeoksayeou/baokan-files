The People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison and stationed troops have enthusiastically responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the army to actively support the leftist masses and assist in industrial and agricultural production. They have dispatched large numbers of soldiers and officers to major factories, mines, rural communes, and colleges and universities in the capital, fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses and cadres. They have fiercely criticized the capitalist-roaders within the party and their reactionary line, promoting the great alliance of revolutionary forces and the "three-in-one combination," and advancing socialist production in urban and rural areas. They have made new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital.

Soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison and stationed troops, who guard Chairman Mao, have created new merits since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have been more vigilant day and night, protecting our great capital and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have received and trained millions of Red Guards from all over the country who came to be seen by Chairman Mao. When revolutionary organizations such as the Third Headquarters of the Red Guards of the Capital's Colleges and Universities were attacked by reactionary organizations like the "Red Flag Army" and "Joint Action," they immediately took action and, together with the revolutionary masses, resolutely struck back, ensuring the safety of the revolutionary organizations. The soldiers and officers, who have always been loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have made new deployments after Chairman Mao issued new instructions. They have set out overnight. Old Red Army soldiers who have followed Chairman Mao in countless battles, old guards who once guarded the caves in Yan'an at night, and new soldiers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought have all quickly joined the front lines of the fiery struggle.

In urban areas, soldiers and officers have formed over 200 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Led by cadres at various levels, they have gone to hundreds of large and medium-sized factories and mines to propagate Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and the "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country." They have used the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to help revolutionary forces solve various real problems in class struggle. At the Fifth Construction Company of Beijing, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party spread the wind of economism. Soldiers and officers who went to the company fought together with the revolutionary masses and quickly repelled the enemy's fierce attacks. In a certain factory, the revolutionary forces were temporarily in the minority. Soldiers and officers stood with them, helping them to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, win over the middle-of-the-road masses and those who were deceived, and expand the leftist forces. In some factories, soldiers and officers enthusiastically helped the proletarian revolutionary forces study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, promoting the great alliance of revolutionary forces by administrative departments. In some units that had won the power struggle and established revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, soldiers and officers enthusiastically helped the members of the leading group to emphasize proletarian politics, establish a new revolutionary order, break the capitalist and revisionist old rules and evil habits, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions to run socialist enterprises and cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Now, in many factories and mines in the capital, with the help of soldiers and officers, the situation of "the army advances and production increases" has emerged. Revolutionary workers and cadres have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. They have further raised their proletarian consciousness in the struggle to thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roader within the party, turning their hatred for the class enemy into a great material force. They have firmly guarded their production posts and created wealth for the country. Many factories and workshops not only overfulfilled their production plans, but some even created new production records since the factory was established.

In the 13 counties (districts) of the capital's suburbs, there are over 250 people's communes with large numbers of soldiers and officers actively working among the revolutionary masses. They not only promptly conveyed Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and the "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" to the broad masses of commune members, but also seriously helped the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at various levels solve various problems that arose in "grasping revolution and promoting production." When spring plowing was imminent, they immediately worked with revolutionary cadres and masses at the county (district) and commune levels to organize command organs at various levels on the production front lines and shouldered the responsibility of "grasping revolution and promoting production." After the establishment of the production front line command department in Huairou County, many problems were encountered. While helping the command department solve problems related to production, soldiers and officers, following Comrade Lin Biao's instruction that Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, will become a great material force, vigorously promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in rural areas. They assisted the command department in holding an experience-sharing meeting on studying Chairman Mao's works, introducing the army's experience in studying Chairman Mao's works to the broad revolutionary cadres and masses. They donated large quantities of Chairman Mao's works, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and portraits of Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants and read Chairman Mao's books with them by the fields, by the villages, and by the kangs, propagating the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the party's policies. Due to the rise of a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary and production situation in the vast rural areas of the capital's suburbs is getting better day by day. The mass criticism of the capitalist-roader within the party is rapidly developing, the leftist forces are rapidly expanding, and many revolutionary cadres are increasingly winning the trust of the revolutionary masses and bravely shouldering the responsibility of leading the revolution and production. Many communes and production teams, under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, not only have better spring plowing production than in previous years but also actively dig wells and build irrigation canals, carrying out basic farmland construction.

In some colleges and universities and hundreds of middle schools in the capital, broad masses of soldiers and officers have joined the Red Guards who have been fighting in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. They have studied together Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas," helping the Red Guards to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and to seize the power of "selfishness" in their minds. They have overcome non-proletarian thoughts such as anarchism and sectarianism, raising the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the Red Guards, promoting the great alliance. Some colleges and universities, with the enthusiastic assistance of soldiers and officers, have established unified revolutionary organizations. Some middle schools' revolutionary forces, with the patient and meticulous help of soldiers and officers, have united by classes, and the movement of resuming classes and making revolution has been carried out vigorously. Now, the revolutionary young fighters in these schools and universities are full of spirit and high morale, launching a total offensive against the capitalist-roader within the party.

These soldiers and officers, who have made new achievements in supporting the leftist forces and assisting in industrial and agricultural production, have been deeply loved by the revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students in the capital. Many revolutionary masses regard the support of soldiers and officers as the greatest care and concern from the great leader Chairman Mao for the proletarian revolutionary forces. They are eagerly learning the glorious traditions and fine style of the People's Liberation Army. Soldiers and officers are also humbly learning from the proletarian revolutionary forces, constantly summarizing experiences, drawing lessons, and determined to better unite, fight, and win with the revolutionary masses, to be the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the capital.

    新华社十九日讯　中国人民解放军北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众和支援工业、农业生产的号召，派出大批指战员到首都工矿企业、农村人民公社和大专院校、中等学校，同广大革命群众、革命干部一道并肩战斗，狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他提出并推行的资产阶级反动路线，促进了无产阶级革命派的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”，促进了城乡社会主义生产的发展，为首都无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的贡献。
    守卫在毛主席身边的北京卫戍区和驻京部队指战员，从无产阶级文化大革命以来，一次又一次地创建了新的功勋。他们更加百倍警惕地日夜保卫着我们的伟大首都，保卫着无产阶级文化大革命；他们接待和训练了成百万名接受毛主席接见的来自祖国各地的红卫兵小将。当原首都大专院校红卫兵第三司令部等革命组织，遭到“红旗军”、“联动”等反动组织袭击时，他们立即出动，和革命群众一起坚决给予打击，保证了革命组织的安全。一贯忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指战员们，在伟大领袖毛主席发出新的号召以后，又立即作了部署，连夜出发。跟着毛主席南征北战几十年的老红军，当年彻夜守卫延安窑洞的老警卫员，以及在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的新战士，都迅速投入了火热斗争的第一线。
    在城镇，指战员们组成了二百多个毛泽东思想宣传队，在各级领导干部的率领下，来到数百个大型和中型的厂矿企业，向广大革命职工、革命干部宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，帮助革命派解决阶级斗争中的各种现实问题。在北京市第五建筑公司，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起了经济主义的妖风。来到这个公司的指战员协同革命群众进行了坚决斗争，迅速击退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。在某工厂，革命派暂时处于少数，指战员们和他们心连心，协助他们彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，争取中间群众和受蒙蔽的人，发展壮大了左派队伍。在一些工厂里，指战员们满腔热情地帮助无产阶级革命派学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想破私立公，促进了无产阶级革命派按行政部门的大联合。在一些取得夺权斗争胜利，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构的单位，指战员们又热情地帮助领导班子的成员突出无产阶级政治，建立革命的新秩序，大破资本主义和修正主义的陈规恶习，大立毛泽东思想，遵照毛主席的指示办社会主义的企业，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。现在，首都许多厂矿企业在指战员们的帮助下，出现了“军队向前进，生产长一寸”的大好形势。广大革命职工和革命干部掀起了在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，他们在彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟，把对阶级敌人的仇恨化为巨大的物质力量，坚守生产岗位，为国家创造财富。许多工厂、车间不仅超额完成了生产计划，有些还创造了建厂以来的生产新纪录。
    在首都郊区十三个县（区）的二百五十多个人民公社，有大批指战员活跃在革命群众之中。他们不仅及时把毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》传给了广大社员，而且认真帮助贫下中农和各级干部解决“抓革命，促生产”中出现的各种问题。当春耕迫在眉睫的时候，他们立即协同县（区）、社的革命干部和革命群众，组织起各级生产第一线指挥机构，肩负起抓革命、促生产的重任。怀柔县生产第一线指挥部成立后，遇到了许多问题，指战员们在协同指挥部解决有关生产方面问题的同时，遵照林彪同志关于毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握就会变为巨大的物质力量的教导，狠抓农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们协助指挥部召开了学习毛主席著作经验交流会，把部队学习毛主席著作的经验介绍给广大革命干部和革命群众。他们把大批毛主席著作、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像，赠给贫下中农，并和贫下中农一起在田头、村旁和炕头上读毛主席的书，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和党的方针政策。由于活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的兴起，首都郊区广大农村革命和生产的形势一天比一天好。群众性的批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争正在迅速发展，革命派的队伍在迅速壮大，许多革命干部日益取得革命群众的信任，勇敢地担起领导革命和生产的重担。许多社、队在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，春耕生产不仅比往年好，而且还积极打井、修渠，进行农田基本建设。
    在首都的一些大专院校和数百所中学里，广大指战员同在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的红卫兵小将一起批判资产阶级反动路线，一起学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，帮助红卫兵小将们在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，克服无政府主义、小团体主义等非无产阶级思想，提高了红卫兵小将的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，促进了大联合。一些大专院校，由于指战员们的热情协助，成立了统一的革命组织。一些中学的革命派在指战员们耐心细致的帮助下，按班级联合起来了，复课闹革命搞得轰轰烈烈。现在，这些大中学校的革命小将意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在全力以赴，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击。
    这些在支持左派、支援工农业生产中又建新功的指战员，受到了首都广大革命职工、贫下中农和革命师生的衷心爱戴。许多革命群众把指战员们的支援，看作是伟大领袖毛主席对无产阶级革命派的最大爱护，最大关怀。他们如饥如渴地学习着人民解放军的光荣传统、优良作风。指战员们也虚心地向无产阶级革命派学习，不断总结经验，吸取教训，决心更好地和革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，做首都无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。
