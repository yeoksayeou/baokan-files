Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on duty in the Xiaoxing'anling put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, learning in struggle and using in struggle, and carrying out ideological revolutionization. This is Comrade Suanzhaoqing, a Communist Party member, a five-good soldier, and a squad leader (on the right), and Zhang Yuqing studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" seriously on the training ground.

Mastering ideological education is the key to uniting the whole Party in the great political struggle. The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, and making full preparations for battle, so as to better defend national defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend the iron-clad mountains and rivers of socialism.

When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an endless force, becoming an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. The air force of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, arms the mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and guides flight training with Mao Zedong Thought, vigilantly defending the airspace of the motherland at all times, ready to annihilate all invading enemies!

The enemy sharpens his knife, and we must also sharpen ours. The People's Liberation Army is a hundred times more alert, firmly holding the battle posts, seizing the revolution, promoting preparedness, and being ready for battle at any time. If the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs dare to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate them! This is a scene of the officers and soldiers of a certain unit's seventh company carefully inspecting their weapons and equipment.

Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people. The naval unit of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the "Sea Pioneer Boat," is a hundred times more alert in guarding the southern gate of the motherland, ensuring the safety of fishermen's production. The officers and soldiers respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions, supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and achieving double victories in revolution and production.

We must not relax our vigilance against the mad revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs just because we have won victories. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian, following Chairman Mao's instructions, seize the revolution, promote preparedness, and conduct preparedness training seriously, being a hundred times more alert in defending national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Stand firmly with the Chinese people, wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people. The People's Liberation Army units of the Shanxi Military District firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly support the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a soldier from a certain unit of the Shanxi Military District standing guard and keeping watch at the Datong grain depot, safeguarding the safety of the grain depot.

    坚守战斗岗位　保卫国防　保卫无产阶级文化大革命
    读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。在小兴安岭执行任务的人民解放军某部干部战士，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，搞好思想革命化。这是共产党员、五好战士、班长冉照清（右）和张玉清在训练场上一起认真学习《毛主席语录》。　　　　　黄立仁摄
    掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。人民解放军广大指战员，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想分析形势，做好充分的战斗准备，以便更好地保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义的铁打的江山。
    这是某部炮连党支部在对干部、战士进行形势教育。
    毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。人民解放军空军某部飞行员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，用毛泽东思想指导飞行训练，时刻警惕地保卫着祖国领空，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人！
    敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀。人民解放军百倍提高警惕，坚守战斗岗位，抓革命，促战备，随时做好战斗准备，美帝国主义及其帮凶胆敢来犯，就坚决、干净、彻底、全部地把它消灭掉！图为某部七连干部战士在认真检查武器装备。
    没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。人民解放军海军某部“海上先锋艇”百倍警惕地守卫着祖国南大门，确保渔民生产安全。指战员们以实际行动响应毛主席的伟大号召，支持无产阶级革命派，夺取革命和生产双胜利。
    我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。福建前线人民解放军某部指战员遵照毛主席的指示，抓革命，促战备，认真进行战备训练，百倍警惕地保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。　　　福军宣摄
    紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务。山西省军区的人民解放军部队，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，为无产阶级文化大革命做出了巨大的贡献。图为山西省军区部队某部战士在大同粮库站岗放哨，保卫粮库安全。
