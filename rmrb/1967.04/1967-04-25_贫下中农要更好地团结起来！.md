The revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, has recently been performed in the capital.

The ballet, performed by the Shanghai Dance School, holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, establishing the newness of socialism and the uniqueness of the proletariat. It has carried out a revolutionary reform of the foreign classical art form of ballet, following the success of the ballet "Red Detachment of Women."

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to make literature and art serve his dream of restoring capitalism and to oppose Chairman Mao's principle of "learning from the past to serve the present and learning from abroad to serve China," once declared a few years ago: "Reflecting modern life cannot be forced; ballet and foreign operas may not be able to reflect it." The revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has refuted his fallacies with ironclad facts!

Over the past decade, a revisionist literary and artistic black line has existed within the literary and artistic circles, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. Socialist literature and art have grown through intense struggle against this black line, headed by Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan, and its backstage boss. The success of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a brilliant victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Unite Better!

This is the first time I have seen a ballet, and I am very fond of this revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl." Chairman Mao said: "The ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the landlord class forced the peasants to rise up repeatedly to resist the rule of the landlord class." Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The ballet "White-Haired Girl" throughout embodies this brilliant thought, fully expressing the spirit of resistance of the poor and lower-middle peasants, especially Xi'er and Yang Bailao. Compared to the opera "White-Haired Girl," this revolutionary reform is excellent and fully in line with the wishes of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a vivid class education for us poor and lower-middle peasants, especially for young farmers like me. There are a few scenes in the play that I found very moving because my family also had such a tragic experience! My grandfather, like Yang Bailao, was beaten to death by the landlord for not being able to repay the debt to the landlord. My grandmother, unable to repay the debt, was forced to sell two daughters, but the debt was still not cleared. The remaining little daughter was also taken by the landlord to offset the debt, just like Xi'er. My father worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, toiling year after year, and was constantly beaten by the landlord. His head was injured by the landlord, his teeth were knocked out by the landlord, and finally, his eyes were beaten blind by the landlord. This is the bloody history of our family. Here, I think of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party advocating the fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial," saying: "The suffering of workers and peasants is that no one exploits them." This is sheer nonsense! We poor and lower-middle peasants hate exploitation the most and despise the landlord class the most. The crimes of the landlord class exploiting us poor and lower-middle peasants are countless and cannot be denounced in a few days and nights. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, who advocates that "exploitation is beneficial," is of the same ilk as the landlords and capitalists.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" also teaches us: never forget class and class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself." In our place, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements have long been colluding and corrupting some wavering cadres. During the three years of temporary difficulties, they joined forces to launch a counterattack against the poor and lower-middle peasants, trying to return the fruits of land reform to the landlords, which was extremely arrogant. We poor and lower-middle peasants, united and supported by the Party and the People's Liberation Army, stood firm against this evil wind. Those bad cadres also fell from power during the "Four Cleanups" movement. However, the struggle did not end there. As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, they regrouped, trying to fish in troubled waters, overthrow the great achievements of the "Four Cleanups" movement, seize power from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and even arrogantly shouted the reactionary slogan of "poor and lower-middle peasants get out." The number one capitalist-roader within the Party advocates the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," but look at our place. Has class struggle been extinguished? No, it has not! Facing this counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide, we poor and lower-middle peasants organized and launched a resolute counterattack; the People's Liberation Army also supported us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionaries, arresting the ringleaders of the reactionary organizations. Thus, that restoration tide was smashed.

Class struggle is long-term, sharp, and complex. In the ballet "White-Haired Girl," Huang Shiren was overthrown thanks to the leadership of the Party, the unity of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the Eighth Route Army; the reactionaries in our place were also overthrown thanks to the leadership of the Party, the unity of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and the People's Liberation Army. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them." We poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionaries must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite better, actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 贫下中农要更好地团结起来！

专栏：

    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，最近在首都上演了。
    由上海市舞蹈学校演出的这个芭蕾舞剧，高举毛泽东文艺思想的伟大红旗，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，对外来的古典艺术形式进行了革命的改造，是继芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》之后的又一个创举。
      党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，为了使文艺为他复辟资本主义的迷梦服务，为了反对毛主席提出的“古为今用”、“外为中用”的原则，几年前曾经扬言：“反映现代生活不能勉强，芭蕾舞，外国歌剧不一定能反映。”在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，用铁一般的事实驳倒了他的谬论！
      十几年来，文艺界存在着一条与毛主席革命文艺路线相对抗的修正主义文艺黑线。社会主义的文艺，是在同以陆定一、周扬、夏衍为首的这条黑线和它的总后台的激烈斗争中成长起来的。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的成功，是毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉胜利。　					——编　者
    贫下中农要更好地团结起来！

    贵州省修文县久长公社白窑大队党支部书记  王忠珍
    我这是头一回看芭蕾舞，我很喜欢这个革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。毛主席说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》自始至终都体现了这一光辉的思想，把贫下中农、特别是喜儿和杨白劳的反抗精神充分表现出来了。比起歌剧《白毛女》来，这一革命的改革改得好，完全符合我们贫下中农的心意。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，对我们贫下中农、特别象我这样的青年农民，是一堂生动的阶级教育课。戏里有几段情节我看了非常激动，因为我家过去也有这样悲惨的经历！我祖父和杨白劳一样，是因为还不起地主的阎王债而被打死的。祖母又因为还不起债，逼得走投无路，被迫卖掉了两个女儿，可是债还是还不清，留下的一个小女儿也象喜儿一样被地主抢去抵债了。我父亲替地主当长工，长年累月劳动，还不断受到地主的毒打，脑袋被地主砍伤，牙齿被地主打掉，最后眼睛也被地主打瞎了。这就是我们家的一部血泪史。在这里，我就想到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的“剥削有功”的谬论，他说：“工人农民的痛苦在于没有人剥削他们”。这完全是胡说八道！我们贫下中农最痛恨的就是剥削，最仇恨的就是地主阶级。地主阶级剥削我们贫下中农的罪恶，几天几夜也控诉不完。说剥削“有功”的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，和地主、资本家完全是一路货。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》还教育我们：千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们那里的地、富、反、坏，长期以来拉拢和腐蚀了一些立场不坚定的干部。在三年暂时困难时期，他们勾结起来向贫下中农进行反攻倒算，要把贫下中农在土改时分得的果实退还给地主，真是猖狂极了。我们贫下中农团结起来，在党和解放军的支持下，顶住了这股歪风。那些坏干部也在“四清”运动中垮了台。但是，斗争并没有就此结束。这次无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他们又集结起来，想混水摸鱼，推翻“四清”运动的伟大成果，从我们贫下中农手中夺权，甚至猖狂地喊出了“贫下中农滚蛋”的反动口号。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派鼓吹什么“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就看看我们那个地方吧。阶级斗争熄灭了吗？没有，根本就没有！面对这股反革命的资本主义复辟逆流，我们贫下中农组织起来，对他们进行了坚决的回击；人民解放军也支持我们贫下中农和革命派，把反动组织的头头抓了起来，这样，那股复辟的逆流就被粉碎了。
    阶级斗争是长期、尖锐、复杂的。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》里的黄世仁被打倒，是靠党的领导，靠贫下中农团结起来，靠八路军；我们那里的反动分子的被打倒，也是靠党的领导，靠我们贫下中农团结起来，靠人民解放军。我们应该牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。”我们贫下中农和革命派，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地团结起来，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
