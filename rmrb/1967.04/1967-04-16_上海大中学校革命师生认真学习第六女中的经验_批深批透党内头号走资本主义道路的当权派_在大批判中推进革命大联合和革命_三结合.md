Shanghai middle and high school revolutionary teachers and students are seriously studying the experience of the Sixth Girls' School. They are deeply and thoroughly criticizing the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road. In the process of criticism, they are promoting revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai, April 15: After the experience of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School in promoting revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism movement was broadcast nationwide, it sparked strong reactions and attention from the broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai's middle and high schools. A wave of learning from the Sixth Girls' School, promoting revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination during the revolutionary criticism movement, has swept across the entire city.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai pointed out: At this crucial moment when the entire nation is launching a general offensive against the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, the People's Daily's reprinting of the experience of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School is the greatest concern, support, encouragement, and exhortation from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao for the Red Guards in Shanghai and throughout the country! At this time when the people of the entire nation are surging forward to launch a general offensive against the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road and are extensively and deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism movement, the experience of the Sixth Girls' School is a typical example of great universal significance. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, and resolutely criticize the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road deeply and thoroughly. We must thoroughly sweep away the pernicious influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, promote revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination during the revolutionary criticism movement, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

In recent days, Red Guard young warriors and revolutionary teachers and students from many middle and high schools in Shanghai have flocked to the Sixth Girls' School to learn from their experiences and express their congratulations. The revolutionary Red Guard young warriors from Shanghai's Shibei Middle School, Yangjin Middle School, Sixty-Ninth Middle School, Jinling Middle School, and Puming Middle School said: Our great commander Chairman Mao and we Red Guards have a heart-to-heart connection. He always points out the direction for us at critical moments. We must unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead of the struggle against the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, achieve revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism movement, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, resume classes and make revolution, and strive to raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our schools to a new height. Many Red Guard young warriors said that the direction of the Sixth Girls' School is completely correct. This is the result of their studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Criticizing the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road is the top priority political task at the moment. Whether or not to carry out revolutionary criticism is the touchstone for testing whether an organization or an individual is implementing Chairman Mao's instructions and whether they are revolutionary or not. The experience of the Sixth Girls' School proves that only by carrying out revolutionary criticism and directing the spearhead upwards can we better implement revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination; by implementing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, we can better, more deeply, and more extensively carry out revolutionary criticism. We must learn from the young warriors of the Sixth Girls' School, direct our spearhead upwards like them, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, seize the power of selfishness in our minds, achieve ideological transformation, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high in the struggle.

On the afternoon of the 14th, more than ten thousand revolutionary Red Guard young warriors and revolutionary teachers and staff in Shanghai, with hearts full of excitement, braved the heavy rain and gathered at People's Square to hold a meeting titled "Shanghai: Highly Hold Up the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Promote Revolutionary Unity and the 'Three-in-One' Combination During the Revolutionary Criticism Movement." At the meeting, a representative of the Red Guards from Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School shared their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the criticism movement and achieving revolutionary unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Representatives from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary mass organizations also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they must firmly grasp the revolutionary criticism as the key to the struggle between the two lines, regard revolutionary criticism as the best school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, as the best classroom for breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit and touching the soul, and as a powerful political force for promoting all work. In the revolutionary criticism mass movement, they will form a vast cultural revolutionary army to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road! They will forever follow Chairman Mao and be the red vanguards of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School, who have highly held up the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism and achieved revolutionary unity, were overjoyed on the 13th when they heard the news that their experience in achieving revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism movement and the editorial of the Wenhui Daily on this topic had been broadcast nationwide. The entire school was in a festive mood. The young warriors excitedly spread the news to each other. They celebrated like it was a holiday, beating drums and gongs, singing and dancing, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouting thousands of times, "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!" Many Red Guard young warriors and revolutionary teachers and students could not contain their excitement and joy, holding all-night discussions, sharing their experiences and resolutions. They said: We must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's earnest expectations. In the struggle, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, and forever be Red Guards loyal to Chairman Mao! We must highly hold up the banner of revolutionary criticism, further achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

The young warriors said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." The top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, in order to protect a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, launched the bourgeois reactionary line, causing estrangement and opposition between students and students, and between students and revolutionary teachers. After the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road was exposed, through revolutionary criticism, we realized: The root cause of obstructing revolutionary unity is the bourgeois reactionary line, and the chief culprit of obstructing revolutionary unity is the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road. We must direct the spearhead of our struggle against this Chinese Khrushchev. We must not fall into the trap of the bourgeois reactionary line again!

The young warriors said that our current unity is just the beginning, and there is still much work to be done. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participate in the revolutionary criticism struggle, better study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," deeply examine our souls, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, be humble and modest, highly hold up the banner of revolutionary criticism, criticize and overthrow the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

After the People's Daily reprinted the experience of Shanghai's Sixth Girls' School in promoting revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism movement, the revolutionary young warriors of the Sixth Girls' School wrote "Resolution Letters," expressing their determination not to disappoint the warm concern of the great leader Chairman Mao, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to consolidate revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism movement, and to launch a general offensive against the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road.

    上海大中学校革命师生认真学习第六女中的经验
    批深批透党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派
    在大批判中推进革命大联合和革命“三结合”
    新华社上海十五日电　上海市第六女子中学在革命的大批判中促进革命大联合的经验向全国广播以后，引起了上海大中学校广大红卫兵战士、革命师生和各革命群众组织强烈的反响和重视。一个向市六女中学习，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的热潮，已经在全市掀起。
    上海广大红卫兵战士和无产阶级革命派指出：正当全国向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，《人民日报》转载上海市第六女中的经验，这是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对上海市和全国红卫兵最大的关怀，最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！正当全国人民风起云涌地向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击，广泛深入地展开革命的大批判运动的时候，市六女中的经验是一个具有极大普遍意义的典型。我们一定更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起革命的批判大旗，坚决把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    连日来，上海许多大中学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，纷纷来到市六女中串连取经，向她们表示祝贺。上海市市北中学、洋泾中学、六十九中学、金陵中学、浦明中学的革命红卫兵小将们说：我们伟大的统帅毛主席和我们红卫兵心连心，他老人家总是在关键时刻给我们指出了前进的方向，我们一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，紧紧把握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头对准党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，推进革命的“三结合”，复课闹革命，努力把学校的斗批改提高到一个新的水平。许多红卫兵小将们说，市六女中的大方向是完全对头的。这是她们活学活用毛主席著作的结果。批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是当前压倒一切的头等重大的政治任务。搞不搞革命的大批判，是检验一个组织、一个人执行不执行毛主席的指示，革命不革命的试金石。市六女中的经验证明，只有开展革命的大批判，矛头一致向上，才能更好地实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”；实行了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，才能更好、更深入、更广泛地开展革命的大批判。我们一定要向市六女中小将学习，象她们那样矛头向上，破私立公，夺头脑里私字的权，实现思想革命化，在斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新高潮。
    十四日下午，上海十多万革命红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工，怀着无比振奋的心情，冒着滂沱大雨，在人民广场举行了“上海市高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合和‘三结合’大会”。会上，上海市第六女中红卫兵代表介绍了她们在大批判运动中活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想基础上实现革命的大联合的体会。上海市革命委员会和革命群众组织的代表，也在会上讲了话。他们一致表示，一定要紧紧抓住革命的大批判这一两条路线斗争的纲，把革命的大批判作为活学活用毛主席著作的最好的学校，作为破私立公、触及灵魂的最好课堂，作为推动各项工作的强大的政治动力，在革命的大批判群众运动中，组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派彻底批倒、批深、批臭！永远紧跟毛主席，做无产阶级文化大革命的红色尖兵！
    高举无产阶级革命的批判旗帜，实现了革命的大联合的上海市第六女中红卫兵和革命师生，十三日听到她们在革命的大批判中实现革命大联合的经验及《文汇报》为此发表的社论已向全国广播这一喜讯后，全校一片欢腾。革命小将们兴奋地奔走相告，她们象欢庆节日一般，敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞，手执红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千百遍地高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”许多红卫兵小将和革命师生，抑制不住内心的兴奋和激动，连夜举行座谈，交谈自己的体会和决心。她们说：我们一定不辜负毛主席和党中央的殷切期望，在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远听毛主席的话，永远做忠于毛主席的红卫兵！我们一定要更高地举起革命的批判旗帜，进一步实现和巩固革命的大联合，彻底批臭、批倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    小将们说，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为了保护一小撮反革命修正主义分子，抛出了资产阶级反动路线，造成我们同学与同学之间、同学和革命教师之间的隔阂和对立。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来以后，通过革命的大批判，使我们认识到：妨碍革命的大联合的根子就在资产阶级反动路线，妨碍革命的大联合的罪魁祸首就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。我们一定要把斗争矛头对准这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，我们绝不能再上资产阶级反动路线的圈套！
    小将们表示，我们现在的大联合，还仅仅是开始，还有很多工作要做。我们要牢记毛主席教导，积极投入革命的大批判大斗争中，更好地活学活用“老三篇”，狠触自己的灵魂，破私立公，戒骄戒躁，高举革命的批判大旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批臭、批倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
