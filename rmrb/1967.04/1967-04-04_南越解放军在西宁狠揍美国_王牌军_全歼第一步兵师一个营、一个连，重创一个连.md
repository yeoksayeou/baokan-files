The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of people's war by continuously smashing a series of large-scale "sweeps" launched by U.S. aggressors in the province of Xining. They have frequently launched attacks, annihilating large numbers of U.S. and puppet troops, and achieving great victories. According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, from March 31 to the early hours of April 1, the liberation forces completely annihilated a camp and a company of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, and severely damaged another company.

On March 30 and 31, a camp of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division was airlifted to a vast open area near the Chau Doc Bridge and then proceeded in three directions for "sweeps." At noon on March 31, the liberation forces attacked a group of enemy troops northeast of Chau Doc Bridge, severely killing a company of enemy troops, and then completely annihilated a company of enemy troops that came to reinforce them.

The U.S. aggressors, unwilling to accept defeat, airlifted another camp of the 1st Infantry Division to the area in the afternoon of March 31. At 4 a.m. on April 1, the liberation forces launched another attack, completely annihilating a camp of U.S. aggressors.

The news agency also reported that from March 18 to 29, the liberation forces in the northeastern region of Xining Province, around Luc Ngan, killed and wounded 864 U.S. aggressors, destroyed 64 enemy vehicles of various types, and shot down 22 aircraft.

The report said that during this "sweep," the enemy deployed five regiments. They were all remnants who had been severely defeated by the liberation forces in the northern and northwestern regions of Xining Province and had very low morale. As soon as they entered the northeastern region of Xining Province, they were immediately attacked by the liberation forces and suffered heavy losses.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation forces in South Vietnam continue to take the initiative to launch attacks and have achieved new victories, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season counteroffensive plan."

According to the report, the military and people of the Southwestern Zone launched 56 attacks on enemy bases during the dry season, killing and dissolving 2,429 enemy troops, including 681 U.S. aggressors; destroying 55 aircraft, 30 vehicles, 10 boats, 10 cannons, and demolishing 300 enemy barracks and many warehouses.

Another report said that in the Quang Tri Province, from March 17 to 22, the liberation forces killed more than 510 enemy troops, including 170 U.S. aggressors, destroyed and damaged 9 vehicles, and shot down one enemy aircraft.

On the night of March 23, the liberation forces in Thua Thien Province launched a fierce attack on a puppet military training camp 4 kilometers southwest of Hue City, killing 50 enemy troops.

On March 14 and 19, the liberation forces in the Phu Vang and Hoi An counties of this province annihilated four platoons of puppet troops in intercepting and attacking enemy troops, and killed and wounded 126 U.S. and puppet troops.

Additionally, the liberation forces in the Phu Luong County of this province, in the first 20 days of March, continuously intercepted enemy convoys on the first highway, destroying and damaging 8 vehicles, and blowing up one bridge.

    据新华社河内三日电　英雄的越南南方解放武装力量，发挥人民战争的强大威力，接连粉碎美国侵略者在西宁省发动的一系列大规模“扫荡”，而且频频出击，消灭大批美伪军，不断取得巨大战果。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，解放武装力量从三月三十一日到四月一日凌晨，在西宁省全歼美军第一步兵师一个营和一个连，重创一个连。
    美军第一步兵师的一营多军队三月三十日和三十一日接连被空运到帅握桥附近的一片空旷地区，然后便分三路进行“扫荡”。三月三十一日中午，解放武装力量袭击了帅握桥东北面的一路敌人，严重杀伤敌军一个连，然后又全歼前来增援的一个连。

    报道说，敌人在这次“扫荡”中，共出动了五个旅的兵力。他们都是最近在西宁省北部和西北部地区被解放武装力量打得焦头烂额的残兵败将，士气极为低落。当他们开进西宁省东北地区后，立即遭到了解放武装力量的袭击，损失惨重。
    新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量继续主动出击，接连取得新战果，沉重地打击了美国强盗的第二个“旱季反攻计划”。
