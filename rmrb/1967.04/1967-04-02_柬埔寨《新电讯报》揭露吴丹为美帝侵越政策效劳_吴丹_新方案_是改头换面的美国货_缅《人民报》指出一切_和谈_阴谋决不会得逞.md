	Cambodian "New Telegram" Exposes U Thant Serving U.S. Aggression in Vietnam
	U Thant's "New Plan" Is Just a Renamed American Scheme
	Burma's "People's Daily" Points Out All "Peace Talks" Tricks Will Not Succeed

	New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, March 31

	Cambodian "New Telegram" published an editorial on March 31 exposing U Thant's new tricks in serving U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	The editorial pointed out that U Thant's so-called "new plan" to solve the Vietnam War is still a product of U.S. imperialist strategy.

	The editorial said: "U Thant is playing with words here, replacing 'negotiations' with 'preliminary talks,' replacing 'ceasefire' with 'stopping hostile actions,' and so on. The form has changed, but the essence remains the same. He insists on equating the aggressor with the victim." The editorial pointed out that U Thant's "new plan" is to "force the Vietnamese people to submit to U.S. threats and blackmail."

	The editorial exposed that the "peace talks" tricks played by U.S. imperialism and the likes of U Thant are actually just repeating some old, failed tactics.

	The editorial said: "The leaders in Washington are using both 'carrots' and 'sticks,' hoping to make their victims submit at the negotiating table. Often after an 'appeasement offensive,' there is a new phase of war escalation." "Now all experienced observers can see that after the war-mongering discussions in Guam, the political offensive of U.S. imperialism has intensified. This policy of waving olive branches in front of the world is well-known. As for those who act as brokers selling Washington's lies, the people of the world are also aware."

	New China News Agency, Rangoon, April 1

	"People's Daily" published an editorial on March 31 pointing out, "All the tricks U Thant plays for imperialism will not succeed."

	The editorial said: The U.S. wants to force the Vietnamese people to accept its conditions. These conditions are: U.S. invading troops will stay in South Vietnam, and the reactionary puppet regime in Saigon must maintain power. This is something the Vietnamese people, who are fighting to expel U.S. invaders, overthrow the puppet regime, and strive to establish a true people's government, will never accept. These two positions are diametrically opposed.

	The editorial pointed out that U Thant talks about fearing the war will expand. If U Thant opposes the expansion of the war, he should work to withdraw the invaders and end the war of aggression. However, "he never demands that the U.S. invaders withdraw from Vietnam."

	The editorial pointed out that U Thant places the aggressor and the victim on an equal footing and wants to help the U.S. invaders obtain at the negotiating table what they cannot get on the battlefield. This is something the Vietnamese people will never accept.

    柬埔寨《新电讯报》揭露吴丹为美帝侵越政策效劳
    吴丹“新方案”是改头换面的美国货
    缅《人民报》指出一切“和谈”阴谋决不会得逞
    新华社金边三十一日电　柬埔寨《新电讯报》三十一日发表社论揭露吴丹为美国侵越政策效劳的新花招。
    社论指出，吴丹提出的所谓解决越南战争问题的“新方案”，仍然是属于美帝国主义战略之内的一路货色。
    社论说：“吴丹在这里玩弄词句，以‘初步会谈’代替‘谈判’，以‘全面休战’代替‘停止敌对行动’等等。形式改变了，但实质还是一样。他硬把侵略者和被侵略者混为一谈。”社论指出，吴丹的“新方案”就是“要逼使越南人民屈服于美国的恫吓和讹诈”。
    社论揭露美帝国主义和吴丹之流玩弄的“和谈”新花招，实际上不过是重复一些早已破产的老套而已。
    社论说：“华盛顿的领导人交相使用‘胡萝卜’和‘大棒’，指望使他们的受害者在会议桌上就范。常常在‘诱惑的攻势’之后就是新的战争升级阶段。”“现在所有有经验的观察家都会看到，在关岛的好战讨论之后，美帝国主义的政治攻势更是加紧了。这种在世界面前摇橄榄枝的政策是人所共知的。至于那些充当贩卖华盛顿的谎言的调停人，全世界人民也是清楚的。”
    新华社仰光一日电  《人民报》三月三十一日发表社论指出，“吴丹替帝国主义效劳的一切阴谋决不会得逞。”
    社论说：美国要迫使越南人民接受它的条件。这些条件是：美国侵略军将赖在南越，西贡傀儡反动派必须维持政权。这是正在为赶走美国侵略军、推翻傀儡反动派和争取建立真正的人民政权而斗争的越南人民所决不会接受的。这两种立场是针锋相对的。
    社论指出，吴丹说什么他害怕战争扩大。如果吴丹反对扩大战争，他就应该为撤出侵略者和结束侵略战争而努力。但是，“他从不要求美国侵略者撤出越南。”
    社论指出，吴丹把侵略者和被侵略者置于同等地位，并且要帮助美国侵略者在谈判桌上取得他们在战场上所不能得到的东西。这是越南人民决不会接受的。
