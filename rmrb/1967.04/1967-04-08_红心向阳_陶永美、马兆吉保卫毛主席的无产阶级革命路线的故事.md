The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* comments: Comrade Tao Yongmei, with the support of her husband Ma Zhaoji, has been engaged in an unyielding struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, exposing the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely executing and defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Her vivid deeds are worthy of serious study by all military cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no middle ground on the question of the line." We should learn from Comrades Tao Yongmei and Ma Zhaoji, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We should learn from their firm stance, clear banner, and daring spirit of struggle. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and opposes the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is our sworn enemy. We must struggle against them to the end, regardless of their position or seniority. We must pull them down from their horses.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and for cultivating millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We should learn from Comrades Tao Yongmei and Ma Zhaoji, studying Chairman Mao's works earnestly and applying them in our actions during the struggle. We should learn from Comrade Tao Yongmei, who, in the most complex and tense moments of struggle, always studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. We must truly master and apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the turbulent waves of class struggle, forging ourselves into successors to the Communist cause who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We learn from Comrade Tao Yongmei and from Comrade Ma Zhaoji, who supported her. We must further carry forward the proletarian revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to struggle. We must repel the new counterattacks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

I

In late December of last year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong New China Printing Factory stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind:

The so-called "All benefits should be like those of old workers" declaration was broadcast!

The so-called resolution to make up for various expenses was issued!

The big-character posters demanding increased benefits were put up one after another...

In this moment of dark clouds rolling in, a newly hired worker bravely stood up and posted the first big-character poster opposing the counter-revolutionary economic line: *How to Treat the Word "Revolution."*

The poster read: "Although I am a temporary worker, I am also the master of the state. I must rise up to revolution and rebel, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, to repel the arrogant attacks of the bourgeoisie, to defend proletarian dictatorship, to defend the Party Central Committee, and to defend Chairman Mao... To revolutionize, one cannot have a short-sighted view, only considering personal temporary interests. To revolutionize, one must think of the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country and the whole world..."

This brave worker who stood up to fight was Tao Yongmei, the wife of Ma Zhaiji, deputy commander of a certain surveying team of the garrison in Jinan and a member of the Communist Party.

Tao Yongmei originally worked as a temporary worker in the Jinan Secondhand Goods Store. She actively studied Chairman Mao's works, continuously raising her proletarian consciousness. At work, she always took on the heaviest tasks, often pedaling a tricycle loaded with 500-600 pounds of goods to the suburbs tens of miles away for business. On holidays, she always volunteered to take shifts for others. Starting from March last year, whenever Tao Yongmei did extra work, the leadership wanted to give her overtime pay, but she always refused firmly, saying to the store's leadership: "This material incentive, this money-first approach, is the old capitalist's trick, a 'revisionist' approach! It is an insult to us workers!"

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Tao Yongmei posted some big-character posters to the store's leadership, so they saw her as a "thorn in the side." On July 31, they dismissed her under the pretext of reducing staff. Before leaving the store, Tao Yongmei bought books like *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People* with the overtime pay she and four class sisters had saved, and gave them to the store's leadership, hoping the store would emphasize politics and take the socialist management road in the future.

At a time when the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was flourishing, Tao Yongmei, who was full of revolutionary passion, was "dismissed." This was a heavy blow to her! Is it a crime for a worker to care about state affairs and rebel in revolution?

One evening, the two children also returned home, and the whole family gathered together for a bitterness meeting. Tao Yongmei talked about her ancestors' history of begging, hunger, and cold. Ma Zhaiji also recalled his miserable life in the old society. The whole family cried sadly. Ma Zhaiji said to Tao Yongmei: "Without Chairman Mao leading the revolution, there would be no today for us poor people. Everything of our family of four belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao. Our whole family must defend the Party and Chairman Mao. On the battlefield of gunfire and bullets, we must do this, and on the battlefield of class struggle without gunfire, we must also do this. We must persist in the struggle..." Then, Ma Zhaiji and Tao Yongmei together studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Tao Yongmei became more courageous, determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and never let New China return to the miserable old society. The next day, Tao Yongmei rushed to the Jinan Municipal Committee, making a sincere request: she didn't want money, she would bring her own food, but she wanted to return to the ranks of workers to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and temper herself. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Committee would not allow her to return to her original unit, so they assigned her to the New China Printing Factory.

Soon after Tao Yongmei entered the factory, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind. That night, Tao Yongmei told Ma Zhaiji about the situation in the factory, angrily saying: "The purpose of the Cultural Revolution is to uproot revisionism and cut off the roots of capitalist restoration. A handful of capitalist-roaders incite some workers to demand immediate benefits. I will write a big-character poster to expose them!" Ma Zhaiji said: "Right! Do it according to Chairman Mao's teachings. 'All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely.'" That night, they both discussed and wrote that revolutionary big-character poster together.

Tao Yongmei's revolutionary big-character poster spoke the hearts of revolutionary workers, exposing the conspiracy of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Many revolutionary workers wrote big-character posters supporting Tao Yongmei. The handful of bad guys were terrified to death. They used tricks, manipulating some new workers who did not understand the truth to attack Tao Yongmei:

Big-character posters supporting Tao Yongmei's revolutionary actions were secretly torn down or covered up; so-called "refutations of Tao Yongmei" big-character posters were put up one after another...

Tao Yongmei's big-character poster was slandered as a "counter-revolutionary" big-character poster opposing the reform of the old system. Tao Yongmei was slandered as the "arch-criminal" who "lies on the breeding ground of revisionist seeds and capitalist restoration, sabotaging the Cultural Revolution."

"Did I do something wrong?" Tao Yongmei repeatedly pondered this question. That night, she told Ma Zhaiji about these situations. Ma Zhaiji then studied Chairman Mao's quotations with her: "Education should be given to the trade union comrades and the worker masses to make them understand that they must not only see the immediate and partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class." They realized that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party's economic conspiracy was not about "reforming the old system." Ma Zhaiji enthusiastically encouraged her: "Whatever is in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, we will do it to the end, and we will not be soft-hearted!" That night, they discussed and wrote another big-character poster together, *Use the Highest Directive to Guide Actions!*, sternly refuting the attacks of some people.

The handful of capitalist-roaders were at a loss for words. They, disregarding the opposition of the revolutionary masses, hastily made a decision to make up for the welfare fees, first giving each new worker 7.5 yuan for heating. When someone tried to stuff the heating fee into Tao Yongmei's hand, she was so angry that her hands trembled, immediately finding the factory director to return the money. This factory director played dead, refusing to take it back.

Tao Yongmei returned home, both anxious and angry. Ma Zhaiji again studied Chairman Mao's teachings on being vigilant against the enemy's sugar-coated shells with her, enthusiastically encouraging her: "The class enemy has already fired sugar-coated shells. We must resolutely counterattack. This stinking money, even if it is one cent in our hands, will sully the honor of workers. We must unite with all revolutionary workers in the factory to repel the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line!" The next day, Tao Yongmei entered the factory and posted the third big-character poster opposing economicism. She held the 7.5 yuan of stinking money, spreading the harm of counter-revolutionary economicism to everyone she met. Many deceived new workers saw through the enemy's tricks, returning the money to Tao Yongmei. Tao Yongmei found a factory director, throwing the stinking money at him: "Take back your sugar-coated shells. Revolutionary workers don't want this stinking money as taught by Chairman Mao!"

II

Class struggle is complex and sharp, and the class enemy is unwilling to admit defeat. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party arranged for further persecution of Tao Yongmei.

The handful of reactionaries in the factory, manipulating a reactionary organization, held a meeting to struggle against Tao Yongmei, arrogantly announcing: "Tao Yongmei is 'against the reform of the old system, a counter-revolutionary'!" At the meeting, they did not allow Tao Yongmei to speak. Tao Yongmei stood on a stool and argued back. The reactionaries also threatened: "You, Tao Yongmei, couldn't have come up with these devilish ideas alone. You must expose your backstage boss!"

Tao Yongmei returned home and told Ma Zhaiji: "I've caused you trouble. They want to expose you!"

Ma Zhaiji firmly said: "No! We are doing what Chairman Mao teaches. There is no 'trouble' to be afraid of!" They studied Chairman Mao's teachings together: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests; at all times and in all places, insist on correct principles, and tirelessly struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors..." Ma Zhaiji said: "As a Communist Party member, I do not hide my political views. My support for you is not because of family relations, but because of the interests of the Party and the people, supporting and assisting a revolutionary comrade. Know that they are not opposing you, a small temporary worker, but opposing you for supporting and executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the face of such major issues, we must have a firm stance and a clear attitude..."

Tao Yongmei said: "I am not afraid, but they are unreasonable. I want to go to Beijing and ask Chairman Mao to see if our big-character posters are correct!"

Ma Zhaiji said: "Chairman Mao is busy day and night with the affairs of the people of the whole country and the whole world. How can everyone go to bother him with their affairs. Chairman Mao calls on us to 'grasp revolution and promote production.' We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and never leave our production posts!"

Tao Yongmei gave up the idea of going to Beijing, determined to stand tall and fight with her class sisters to welcome new battles.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tao Yongmei has not forgotten the revolution or production.

During the noon break, she did not rest. The handful of bad guys sneered at her: "Be self-aware, don't disturb others' rest!" "Fake enthusiasm, don't pretend!" Tao Yongmei thought: "I listen to Chairman Mao's words, grasp revolution, and promote production. You want me to drop my responsibilities, that's a foolish wish. The more you scold, the more I will do!" Tao Yongmei, this temporary worker who had just entered the factory, with her boundless love for Chairman Mao and her unshakable belief in the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, overcame countless difficulties and quickly caught up with the work quota of the old workers.

In the days of intense struggle, no matter how late she worked or how much she was wronged, she always went to work an hour early every morning, arriving at the factory to light the stove and move the books everyone needed to check to the workbench, so everyone could start working as soon as they arrived. Sometimes she arrived too early, and the workshop was not open, so she swept the ground outside the door.

One night at twelve o'clock, a capitalist-roader within the Party deliberately incited a large number of workers to go to Beijing to file a complaint. More than two hundred people rushed to the Jinan Railway Station. Tao Yongmei, hearing the news, was anxious and immediately rode her bicycle to catch up. On the way, she caught up with the crowd and said to the leader: "Comrades, we must not be deceived. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, grasp revolution, and promote production. We must not let so many people leave their production posts!" Tao Yongmei explained along the way, following them all the way to the train station. Until around four in the morning, with the persuasion of Tao Yongmei and other comrades, everyone decided not to go to Beijing, and she finally went home to rest.

III

"The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord."

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were becoming more and more difficult to get along with. They colluded with the handful of bad guys in the factory and reactionary organizations in society, staging a counter-revolutionary fake seizure of power on January 24. They labeled all organizations with different views as "royalist" and sealed them, directing the struggle at the true revolutionaries. It was truly "dark clouds pressing down, the city about to collapse."

At this time, Ma Zhaiji again studied Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win with Tao Yongmei. Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength. Tao Yongmei repeatedly recited, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The more frantic the enemy, the more they expose themselves. Their arrogance is the day of their doom. She was determined to thoroughly expose the evil conspiracy of the handful of bad guys and struggle against them to the end.

The next day, the handful of bad guys staged a so-called celebration of the seizure of power in the factory. Tao Yongmei and other revolutionary workers resolutely did not participate. After the meeting, the handful of bad guys manipulated some people to write big-character posters celebrating the event. Tao Yongmei resolutely did not write, and she exposed the bad deeds of the handful of bad guys to everyone she met. Many revolutionary workers stood firmly with Tao Yongmei, fighting side by side with her against the class enemy. Tao Yongmei and these revolutionary workers became the thorn in the side and the flesh in the eye of the handful of bad guys.

They posted a special big-character poster questioning Tao Yongmei: "Tao Yongmei hates the seizure of power by the capitalist-roaders to the bone, does not participate in the celebration meeting, what is her intention? What is her purpose?"

Tao Yongmei firmly answered: "Against your counter-revolutionary fake seizure of power, I must hate it to the bone. Against those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought, I must hate it to the bone."

One trick failed, another poisonous plan was hatched. The handful of bad guys, using the power they usurped, arbitrarily changed the shifts and positions of revolutionary workers, not allowing revolutionary workers to get close to each other. They arranged Tao Yongmei alone at a table, implementing isolation...

The voice of revolutionary truth cannot be silenced! The red hearts of class sisters are inseparable!

They did not allow revolutionary workers to talk to Tao Yongmei, so comrades used notes to communicate and encourage each other, continuing the fight. They did not allow others to approach Tao Yongmei, but worker Xu Suzhen insisted on walking arm in arm with Tao Yongmei. The revolutionary masses always stood with Tao Yongmei.

The class enemy wanted to destroy Tao Yongmei, using the vicious tactic of fatigue. They blocked her in a workshop, guarding the door to prevent revolutionary workers from entering, manipulating some people to debate with Tao Yongmei from seven in the morning to seven in the evening, trying to make her exhausted and surrender. However, the revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought had the reddest hearts and the hardest bones. Tao Yongmei argued more passionately and more spiritedly...

That night at four o'clock, Tao Yongmei returned home and collapsed on the bed. When she woke up, Ma Zhaiji comforted her while reading Chairman Mao's quotations to her: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in difficult times, and raise our courage..." Chairman Mao's teachings inspired Tao Yongmei. The next morning, she went to work with new fighting spirit. She and the revolutionary workers united closely and launched an even more intense struggle. The handful of bad guys controlled the workshop, not allowing the printing of revolutionary leaflets, and blocking revolutionary news. Tao Yongmei and everyone else used steel plates to carve and print themselves, mercilessly exposing the crimes of the handful of bad guys. Although the handful of bad guys hated Tao Yongmei and other revolutionary workers to the bone and threatened her, Tao Yongmei still firmly said: "With Chairman Mao backing us, with Mao Zedong Thought guiding us, and with class brothers and sisters fighting side by side, we fear nothing. We will definitely win!"

Just at this critical moment, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan firmly responded to Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses, enthusiastically supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction, giving the proletarian revolutionary faction great encouragement. The whole city of Quanzhou boiled! The revolutionary masses shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand and ten thousand times!

The public security organs, which had seized power from the proletarian revolutionary faction, lawfully detained the ringleaders of the reactionary organizations within the factory. The broad masses who had been deceived woke up one after another and stood with the revolutionary faction. Tao Yongmei was unanimously elected by all revolutionary comrades in the factory as the representative of the revolutionary mass organization.

Recently, Comrade Ma Zhaiji and Comrade Tao Yongmei studied Chairman Mao's articles such as *On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party* together. They are determined to be with the masses, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and advance bravely along the proletarian revolutionary line indicated by Chairman Mao, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our motherland's socialist mountains and rivers will never change color for ten thousand generations!

    红心向阳
    ——陶永美、马兆吉保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的故事
    《解放军报》编者按：陶永美同志在她的爱人马兆吉同志支持下，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行不屈不挠的斗争，无情地揭露资产阶级反动路线的罪行，坚决执行和保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的生动事迹，值得全军干部、战士、职工和家属同志认真学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”我们应该学习陶永美、马兆吉同志的无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高贵品质，学习他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，敢于斗争的革命精神。谁要是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，谁就是我们不共戴天的敌人，我们就要和他斗争到底，不管他职位多高，资格多老，一定要把他拉下马。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是活学活用毛主席著作，造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的最好的学校。我们要象陶永美同志和马兆吉同志那样，在斗争中认真活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导一切行动。要象陶永美同志那样，越是在斗争复杂紧张的时刻，越要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。我们一定要在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，真正学会掌握和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的共产主义事业的接班人。
    我们向陶永美同志学习，向支持陶永美同志的马兆吉同志学习，要进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢于斗争的无产阶级革命精神，打退党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    一
    去年十二月下旬，山东新华印刷厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派掀起了一股反革命经济主义的黑风：
    所谓“一切福利要象老工人一样”的“宣言”广播了！
    所谓补发各种费用的“决议”出笼了！
    所谓要求增加福利的大字报也纷纷贴出了……
    在这黑云滚滚的时刻，一个刚刚进厂不久的新工人勇敢地站了出来，贴出了第一张反对反革命经济主义的大字报：《如何对待“革命”二字》。
    大字报写道：“我虽然是一个临时工，但也是国家的主人，我要起来革命造反，要在我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。……要革命就不能眼光短浅，只从个人的暂时利益去打算，要革命就要从全国全世界人民的根本利益去着想……”。
    这个勇敢站出来进行斗争的临时工叫陶永美。是济南驻军某部测量队副队长、共产党员马兆吉的爱人。
    陶永美同志原先在济南旧货商店当临时工。她积极学习毛主席著作，不断提高无产阶级觉悟，劳动中，总是抢重活干，常常蹬着载有五、六百斤货物的三轮车，到几十里路外的郊区去营业。假日里，她也总是抢着代替别人值班。从去年三月开始，每逢陶永美多干了活，领导上要给她加班费的时候，她都严词拒绝，并且向店的领导提出：“这种物质刺激、金钱挂帅，是旧社会资本家的一套，是‘修’字味的一套！是对我们工人的侮辱！”
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，陶永美给店里的领导人贴了一些大字报，因而他们把陶永美看做是“最扎手的刺”。七月三十一日，他们以减员为名宣布解雇陶永美。陶永美离店之前，把她和四个阶级姐妹攒的所谓加班费十多元钱，一块买了《论突出政治》等书籍送给店的领导，希望商店今后突出政治，走社会主义的经营道路。
    正在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃发展的时候，怀着满腔革命激情的陶永美被“解雇”，这对她是多么沉重的打击！难道一个工人关心国家大事犯法，革命造反有罪？
    一天晚上，两个孩子也回到家里，他们全家人凑在一起，开了个忆苦会。陶永美讲了祖辈讨饭、挨饿受冻的苦难家史。马兆吉也回忆了在旧社会的穷苦生活。全家都难过地哭了。马兆吉对陶永美说：“没有毛主席领导闹革命，就没有咱穷人的今天。我们全家四口人的一切都是属于党和毛主席的。我们全家人都要保卫党，保卫毛主席。在枪林弹雨的战场上要这样，在没有枪炮声的阶级斗争的战场上也要这样。我们一定要坚持斗争……”接着，马兆吉又和陶永美一起学习了毛主席关于“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导。陶永美更加鼓起了勇气，决心好好听毛主席的话，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，绝不让新中国再回到苦难的旧社会。第二天，陶永美就跑到济南市委，提出了恳切的要求：就是不要钱，自己背干粮，也要回到工人行列里参加无产阶级文化大革命，锻炼考验自己。市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派无论如何不答应她回原单位工作，把她分配到了新华印刷厂。
    陶永美进厂不久，厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽起了一股反革命经济主义的妖风。晚上回家，陶永美向马兆吉讲了厂里的情况，气愤地说：“文化大革命的目的是挖修正主义的根，断资本主义复辟的种。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派煽动一些工人闹眼前福利，我要写大字报揭露！”马兆吉说：“对！按毛主席的教导办。‘凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。’”当夜，他们俩一块酝酿写出了那张革命的大字报。
    陶永美这张革命的大字报，说出了革命工人的心里话，戳穿了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋。许多革命工人纷纷写出了支持陶永美的大字报。一小撮坏家伙害怕得要死，他们施展诡计，操纵一些不明真相的新工人对陶永美展开了围攻：
    支持陶永美的革命行动的大字报被偷偷揭走或糊上；所谓“反驳陶永美”的大字报却一张接一张地贴了出来……。
    陶永美的大字报被诬蔑成“反对改革旧制度的反革命”大字报。陶永美被诬蔑为“躺在繁殖修正主义种子、复辟资本主义的温床上，破坏文化大革命”的
  “罪魁”。
    “难道是我错了吗？”陶永美反复思考这个问题。晚上回家来，她向马兆吉讲了这些情况。马兆吉便同她一起学习毛主席语录：“应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”他们认识到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞经济主义的阴谋，绝不是什么“改革旧制度”。马兆吉热情地鼓舞她：“凡是符合毛主席教导的，我们坚决干到底，决不作软骨头！”这天夜里，他们又一起酝酿写出了第二张大字报《用最高指示指导行动！》，对一些人的围攻作了义正词严的驳斥。
    一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派理屈词穷，他们不顾革命群众的反对，仗着掌握的大权迫不及待地作出决定：补发福利费，先给新工人每人补发取暖费七元五角。当有人把取暖费塞到陶永美手里的时候，她气得两手打颤，立即找厂长把钱退给他。这个厂长耍死赖，拒不收回。
    陶永美回到家里，又急又气。马兆吉又和她一起学习毛主席关于谨防敌人糖衣炮弹攻击的论述，热情地鼓励她说：“阶级敌人已经射出了糖衣炮弹，我们应该坚决还击。这臭钱，哪怕是一分钱在我们手里，也会玷污我们工人的荣誉，我们要团结全厂的革命工人击退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”
    第二天，陶永美进厂贴出了第三张反对经济主义的大字报。她手里拿着这七元五角臭钱，逢人便宣传反革命经济主义的毒害。许多受蒙蔽的新工人认清了敌人的诡计，纷纷把钱交给陶永美。陶永美找到了一个厂长，把这些臭钱摔给了他：“收起你们的糖衣炮弹，毛主席教导的革命工人不希罕这几个臭钱！”……
    二
    阶级斗争是复杂尖锐的，阶级敌人是不甘心失败的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派布置了对陶永美的进一步迫害。
    厂里一小撮反动分子操纵的一个反动组织，召开了一次斗争陶永美的大会，他们狂妄地宣布：陶永美是“反对改革旧制度的反革命！”会上，他们不允许陶永美说话。陶永美硬是站到凳子上据理驳斥。反动分子还威胁说：“你陶永美一个人出不了这些鬼点子，一定要把你家里的后台老板揪出来！”
    陶永美回到家里，告诉马兆吉：“我给你惹祸了，他们要揪你！”
    马兆吉坚定地说：“不！我们是按照毛主席的教导做的，没有什么‘祸’可怕！”他俩一起学习毛主席教导：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，……”马兆吉说：“我作为一个共产党员，毫不掩饰自己的政治观点，我对你的支持不是因为亲属关系，而是从党和人民的利益出发，对一个革命同志的支持和援助。要知道，他们反对的不是你一个小小的临时工，而是反对你拥护和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在这样的大是大非面前，我们一定要立场坚定，态度鲜明……”
    陶永美说：“怕我倒不怕，只是他们不讲理。我想到北京去，请毛主席他老人家看看我们的大字报写得对不对！”
    马兆吉说：“毛主席他老人家日夜操劳着全国、全世界人民的大事，哪能人人有事都去给他老人家添麻烦。毛主席号召我们‘抓革命，促生产’，我们要听毛主席的话，决不离开生产岗位！”
    陶永美打消了去北京的念头，决心挺直腰杆和阶级姐妹们一起迎接新的战斗。
    陶永美从无产阶级文化大革命以来，没有忘记革命，也没有忘记生产。
    中午歇班时间，她不休息。一小撮坏分子就讽刺她：“自觉点，不要影响别人休息！”“假积极，别装蒜了！”陶永美心想：“我听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产，你们想让我撂挑子是痴心妄想，你们越骂，我越干！”陶永美这个刚进厂不久的临时工，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，怀着保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的必胜信念，战胜了重重困难，很快赶上了老工人的工作定额。
    在斗争激烈的日子里，她不管工作到多么晚，也不管受多大委屈，每天早上总是提前一个钟头上班，赶到工厂把火炉生好，把大家要查的书一罗罗搬到案台，好让大家一上班就可以工作。有时来早了，车间没开门，她就在门外扫地。
    一天夜里十二点钟，一个党内走资本主义道路的当权派，故意挑动大批工人进京告状。二百多人一齐向济南车站奔去。陶永美闻讯心急如焚，立即蹬上自行车追赶。在半路上，她追上了人群，向带队的说：“同志们，我们不能上当，要听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产，千万不能这么多人离开生产岗位！”陶永美一边走一边讲道理，一直跟到火车站。直到早晨四点多钟，在陶永美和其他同志的劝阻下，大家决定不去北京了，她才放心地回家休息。
    三
  　“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派越来越混不下去了。他们通过厂里的一小撮坏分子和社会上的反动组织勾结，在一月二十四日炮制了反革命的假夺权。把凡是和他们观点不同的组织一律戴上保皇帽子，封掉，把斗争的矛头指向真正的革命派。真是“黑云压城城欲摧”。
    这时，马兆吉又同陶永美一起学习了毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导。毛主席的教导，给他们灌注了无穷的力量。陶永美反复背诵着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”敌人越疯狂，就越暴露，他们嚣张之时，也就是他们灭亡之日。她决心彻底揭穿这一小撮坏分子的罪恶阴谋，同他们斗争到底。
    第二天，这一小撮坏分子在厂里导演了一个所谓庆祝夺权胜利大会。陶永美同其他革命工人坚决不参加。会后，一小撮坏分子又操纵一些人大写所谓“庆贺”的大字报。陶永美坚决不写，并且逢人就揭露这一小撮坏人干的坏事。许多革命工人都坚定地站在陶永美一边，同她一起和阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。陶永美和这些革命工人便成了一小撮坏分子的眼中钉，肉中刺。
    他们贴出特号大字报质问陶永美：“陶永美对夺当权派的权恨之入骨，不参加庆祝大会，到底是什么企图？什么目的？”
    陶永美坚定地回答：“对你们的反革命假夺权就是要恨之入骨，对反对毛泽东思想的人就是要恨之入骨。”
    一计不成，再出毒计。一小撮坏分子利用他们篡夺的大权，任意调动革命工人的班次位置，不让革命工人互相接近。他们把陶永美单独安排在一张桌子上，实行隔离……。
    革命真理的声音是封不住的！阶级姐妹血肉相连的红心是隔不开的！
    他们不让革命工人和陶永美说话，同志们就用纸条互相串连，互相鼓舞，坚持战斗。他们不许其他人同陶永美接近，工人徐素贞偏偏同陶永美挽着手走。革命群众始终同陶永美站在一起。
    阶级敌人想搞垮陶永美，采用了恶毒的疲劳战术。把她堵进一个车间，把住大门不让革命工人进去，操纵一些人从早七点到晚七点轮番同陶永美进行所谓辩论，想弄得陶永美精疲力尽，低头认输。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反战士，心最红，骨头最硬。陶永美越辩越激昂，越辩越精神……。
    这天夜里四点，陶永美回到家里，一头晕倒在床上。等她苏醒过来，马兆吉一边安慰她，一边给她读毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”……
    毛主席的教导激励着陶永美。第二天一清早，她带着新的斗争勇气上班了。她和革命工人紧紧团结在一起展开了更加激烈的斗争。一小撮坏蛋控制车间不给印刷革命传单，封锁革命消息。陶永美就和大伙一起用钢板自己刻，自己印，无情地揭发一小撮坏分子的罪恶。尽管一小撮坏分子对陶永美等革命工人恨之入骨，对她进行威胁，但陶永美仍坚定地说：“有毛主席给我们撑腰，有毛泽东思想给我们指路，有阶级兄弟姐妹并肩战斗，我们什么都不怕，我们一定能够胜利！”
    就在这关键时刻，人民解放军驻济南部队坚决响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，热情地支持无产阶级革命派，给了无产阶级革命派极大的鼓舞。整个泉城沸腾了！革命群众千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    无产阶级革命派掌了权的公安机关，依法拘留了厂内反动组织的首恶分子。广大受蒙骗的群众纷纷觉醒，站到革命派一边。陶永美被全厂革命同志一致选为革命群众组织的代表。
    最近，马兆吉同志又和陶永美同志一起学习了毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文章，他们决心和群众在一起，永远听毛主席的话，照毛主席指引的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证我们祖国的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色！
