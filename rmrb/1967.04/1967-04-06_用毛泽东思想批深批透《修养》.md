Capital Red Guards Hold Mass Meeting to Criticize the Reactionary Nature of "In the Blink of an Eye"
Using Mao Zedong Thought to Thoroughly Criticize "In the Blink of an Eye"

The book "In the Blink of an Eye" wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism but peddles revisionist goods, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. It is a poisonous weed that must be exposed and its poison cleared away. We must follow the bright path of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward with giant strides!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 5, the Capital Red Guards Representative Congress held a mass meeting on April 3 to thoroughly criticize the reactionary nature of the book "In the Blink of an Eye." They angrily denounced the crimes of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party who used his book "In the Blink of an Eye" to poison a broad range of Party members and revolutionary masses.

The meeting pointed out that "In the Blink of an Eye" wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism but peddles counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. It is a poisonous weed that is thoroughly anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. In this new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the poisonous weed "In the Blink of an Eye," and thoroughly overthrow the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." Nie Yuanzi, a leader of the Capital Red Guards Representative Congress, first delivered the opening speech. She said that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive stage of uniting the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line. Thoroughly criticizing the poisonous weed "In the Blink of an Eye" is an important part of criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line. She said, to defend Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, mobilize the masses more broadly, and criticize "In the Blink of an Eye" with both words and deeds. Let us thoroughly expose the false face of "In the Blink of an Eye," eliminate its poison both domestically and internationally, and smash the shackles that the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party has placed on the minds of Party members.

"In the Blink of an Eye" is a manifesto for the restoration of capitalism

A representative from the Jian Gangshan Detachment of Tsinghua University spoke, pointing out that "In the Blink of an Eye" is a thoroughly revisionist party-building program and a manifesto for the restoration of capitalism. For a long time, the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Beijing Municipal Committee have tried to use the reactionary "In the Blink of an Eye" to corrupt and poison our Party members and the broad masses of young people, thereby preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in our country.

The former Party Committee of Tsinghua University "educated" Party members and cadres strictly according to this "In the Blink of an Eye." They did not educate Party members to be servants of the people but rather claimed with great ambition that "in a few decades, a batch of state leaders will emerge from Tsinghua graduates." Under such education, some people regarded joining the Party and becoming a cadre as a ladder to climb up. They did not require Party members to share the same breath and fate with the masses and accept the supervision of the masses, but rather, according to the fallacies of "In the Blink of an Eye," they let Party members specially "fight against the backward consciousness and phenomena among the masses," overthrowing others. When some Party members made serious political mistakes and even violated Party discipline and state laws, the Party Committee did not place these people among the masses for criticism but, under the pretext of "protecting cadres," hid filth and protected them to pass inspection. They did not require Party members to go among the masses to experience storms and gain experience, to grow and temper themselves in practice, but rather, according to the fallacies propagated by "In the Blink of an Eye," they let them stay in their studies, detached from the masses, "reflect in seclusion," and "cultivate themselves," climbing up. Poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye," one would deviate from political struggle, abandon ideological reform, and allow bourgeois ideology to fill one's mind. Poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye," one could only use the banner of Party interests to engage in personalist activities. Poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye," one would, for the sake of climbing up, for the sake of developing "individuality," and for the sake of protecting one's vested interests, be servile and obedient to leaders, slavishly compliant, and become a tool for implementing the reactionary bourgeois line. Poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye," one could only become a captive of revisionism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many Party members and cadres who had been poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye" have already or are in the process of breaking free from the ideological shackles of "In the Blink of an Eye," and are joining the fiery revolutionary struggle, making a big fuss against revisionism, and marching forward in big strides on the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao. Let us firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly eliminate the poison of "In the Blink of an Eye"!

A representative from the Jian Gangshan Commune of the Normal University spoke, exposing the reactionary nature of the "theory of intra-party peace" propagated in "In the Blink of an Eye," pointing out that this fallacy is a tool for the restoration of capitalism. He said in his speech that the history of the Communist Party of China is a history of class struggle, a history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and various "left" and "right" opportunist lines, and a history of repeatedly achieving victory. The number one capitalist-roadier within the Party talks about "intra-party peace" but is the one who repeatedly launches ferocious attacks on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. His so-called "intra-party peace" is essentially to allow class enemies and opportunists to launch ferocious attacks on our Party and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, while not allowing us proletarians to counterattack and struggle against them; it is to replace the revolutionary dialectics of Marxism-Leninism with the revisionist "unity of opposites"; it is to replace the theory of class struggle with the theory of class reconciliation, to obscure the class nature of intra-party struggle, to advocate for intra-party peace without principles, to cancel the struggle between the two lines within the Party, and to serve his evil purpose of usurping the Party and the state. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly smash "In the Blink of an Eye," letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds.

"For the public is false, for the private is true"

A representative from the Dongfanghong Commune of the Geological Institute spoke at the meeting, severely criticizing the "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" propagated in "In the Blink of an Eye." He said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members, no matter when and where, should not place personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." Following Chairman Mao's words means putting the public first, which is the worldview of the proletariat; conversely, placing personal interests first is putting the private first, which is the worldview of the bourgeoisie. The contradiction between the interests of the Party and personal interests is the contradiction between the public and the private, the struggle between the worldview of the proletariat and the worldview of the bourgeoisie. The number one capitalist-roadier within the Party proposed that personal interests should completely fuse with the interests of the Party, which is a trick, hiding filth behind the signboard of the interests of the Party, developing various forms of personalism. The "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" is openly advocating for "public-private joint ventures" in the ideological realm, privatizing the public, putting the private first, with the public being false and the private being true. This fallacy is advocating for personalism under the banner of the "interests of the Party," trying to stuff personal interests into the interests of the Party, "fusing" them, and legalizing personalism within the Party. This is the essence and core of the fake revolutionary but truly reactionary "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poison of this fallacy is widespread. Many cadres are afraid of being demoted, afraid of losing their positions, afraid of making mistakes, and afraid of losing personal interests, and thus stand on the side of the reactionary bourgeois line and make serious mistakes. The "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" serves the reactionary bourgeois line. We must launch a massive "people's war" to thoroughly criticize and expose "In the Blink of an Eye" and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

Poisoned by "In the Blink of an Eye" will become a political fool

A student from the gymnastics class of the Physical Education Department of the Beijing Workers and Peasants Institute spoke at the meeting, using her personal experience to denounce the poisoning of "In the Blink of an Eye." She said: Under the long-term enslavement of the shackles of "In the Blink of an Eye," my proletarian revolutionary will was worn down, and bourgeois personalism and slavishness grew, turning me into a cautious gentleman, a political fool, to the extent that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deviated from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, became a royalist soldier for the capitalist-roadier, helped them implement the reactionary bourgeois line, and became an obstacle to the movement. She said that the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party in "In the Blink of an Eye" vigorously advocated for "cultivating oneself," for becoming a great person while "cultivating oneself," and for becoming a model while "cultivating oneself." I found the theoretical basis for the existence of personalism in "In the Blink of an Eye," learned the methods of developing personal interests under the protection of "working for the Party," and produced the idea that "public-private joint ventures" are natural, forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings, forgetting that "public-private joint ventures" are incompatible like fire and water, and the two cannot coexist. Advocating for "public-private joint ventures" is actually falsely publicizing the private, putting the private first, and protecting personal interests. The number one capitalist-roadier within the Party, in order to achieve his unspoken purpose, seduced and corrupted the youth to accept his revisionist goods of "public-private joint ventures," using this to resist and obstruct Chairman Mao's spirit of "wholeheartedly," "completely," and "thoroughly" serving the people. This is one aspect of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party's struggle with Chairman Mao for the youth, and this is the struggle between the two lines. She said, we must never be fooled by "In the Blink of an Eye" again! In the future, I will definitely join the proletarian revolutionaries, closely follow Chairman Mao, firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, read Chairman Mao's books every day, use the "Three Articles" as my motto to transform my worldview, truly return to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, work for the Party, fight for the Party, and fight again!

Firmly defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

Representatives from the Mao Zedong Thought Detachment of the Beijing Workers and Peasants Institute and the Dongfanghong of the Beijing Institute of Mining jointly spoke, angrily exposing the crimes of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party who used his "In the Blink of an Eye" to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They said in their speech that in 1962, when domestic and international class struggles were extremely sharp, when the Soviet revisionist leadership was fiercely attacking the Communist Party of China, which held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as "dogmatism," the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party thought that the time for restoration had come and reprinted and distributed "In the Blink of an Eye." The reprinted "In the Blink of an Eye" did not mention opposing revisionism but instead fiercely attacked "leftist opportunism," "intra-party excessive struggle," and "dogmatism," directly pointing the spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The speech pointed out: We understand best that Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guiding ideology for our revolution to achieve victory, and Chairman Mao's correct leadership is the fundamental guarantee for our revolution to achieve victory. For Chairman Mao, we are infinitely loving, infinitely loyal, infinitely believing, and infinitely admiring. We will firmly defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will forever follow Chairman Mao forward, forward, and forward again. Our hearts of loving Chairman Mao will never be lost, even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows!

The representative of the Revolutionary Rebellion Committee of the Capital Publishing System, with a heart full of hatred for the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party, denounced and exposed the former Propaganda Department and the former Cultural Department's small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who, in accordance with the intentions of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party, spared no effort to massively peddle "In the Blink of an Eye" domestically and internationally, and fiercely resisted the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "In the Blink of an Eye" this poisonous weed was not only printed in large quantities in various formats in Chinese throughout the country but also printed in five minority languages and translated into seven foreign languages and distributed to more than eighty countries and regions. In seventeen years, "In the Blink of an Eye" had a total print run of 2,054,100 copies, while our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's works "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were only printed 1,142,500 sets. For the extremely evil deeds of the number one capitalist-roadier within the Party and his henchmen, is it tolerable? In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly criticize and expose "In the Blink of an Eye" and eliminate its poison both domestically and internationally.

The meeting adopted an appeal to comrades in the proletarian revolutionary cause and revolutionary comrades.

The appeal calls on all revolutionary comrades to take immediate action, in the great decisive battle to smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, consolidate the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, advance along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and thoroughly complete the great historical task of struggling, criticizing, and transforming.

### 用毛泽东思想批深批透《修养》

    首都大专院校红代会举行群众大会，批判《修养》反动本质
    用毛泽东思想批深批透《修养》
    《修养》这本书，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，贩卖修正主义的黑货，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，是一株地地道道的大毒草，必须揭穿它的画皮，肃清它的流毒，沿着毛泽东思想的光辉道路，大踏步前进！
    据新华社五日讯　首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会三日举行群众大会，彻底批判《修养》这本书的反动本质，愤怒控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派利用他的《修养》毒害广大党员和革命群众的滔天罪行。
    大会指出，《修养》这本书披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，贩卖反革命修正主义的黑货，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，是一株地地道道的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大毒草。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段，我们无产阶级革命派一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高举革命的批判的旗帜，把《修养》这株大毒草批透、批臭，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派彻底打倒。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。首都大专院校红代会负责人聂元梓同志首先致开会词说，当前的无产阶级文化大革命，进入了无产阶级革命派联合起来，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的决战阶段。要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。彻底批判《修养》这株大毒草，是批判资产阶级反动路线的重要组成部分。她说，为了保卫毛泽东思想，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更广泛地发动群众，口诛笔伐，掀起一个批判《修养》的群众性的高潮。彻底揭穿《修养》的画皮，清除它在国内外的流毒，彻底粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派套在党员群众思想上的枷锁。
    《修养》是一本资本主义复辟的宣言书
    清华大学井冈山兵团代表在讲话中指出，《修养》是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义的建党纲领，是一个资本主义复辟的宣言书。长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、旧中宣部、旧北京市委力图以反动的《修养》来腐蚀和毒害我们的党员，腐蚀和毒害广大的青年，从而为在我国复辟资本主义进行舆论准备。
    前清华大学党委对党员、干部的“教育”，就是不折不扣地遵照这个《修养》行事的。他们不是教育党员要做人民的勤务员，而是野心勃勃地宣称“过几十年后，要从这里出一批清华毕业的国家领导人”。在这种教育下，有的人就把入党、当干部做为向上爬的阶梯。他们不是要求党员与群众同呼吸共命运，接受群众的监督，而是按照《修养》的谬论，让党员专门“和群众中的落后意识、落后现象进行斗争”，革别人的命。有的党员犯了严重的政治错误，甚至违犯党纪国法，党委不是把这些人放到群众中去进行批判，而是以“爱护”干部为名，藏污纳垢，保护过关。他们不是要求党员到群众中去经风雨见世面，在实践中锻炼成长，而是按照《修养》宣扬的谬论，让他们关在书斋里，脱离群众“闭门思过”，“修身养性”，往上爬。中了《修养》的毒，就会离开政治斗争，放弃思想改造，任凭资产阶级思想充斥自己的头脑。中了《修养》的毒，就只能是打着党的利益的旗号，干着发展个人主义的勾当。中了《修养》的毒，就会为了向上爬，为了发展“个性”，为了保护自己的既得利益，对领导唯唯诺诺，俯首贴耳，奴性十足，成为执行资产阶级反动路线的工具。中了《修养》的毒，就只能成为修正主义的俘虏。在无产阶级文化大革命中，许多曾经受过《修养》毒害的党员、干部，已经或者正在摆脱《修养》的思想枷锁，投入了火热的革命斗争的实践，大造修正主义的反，向着毛主席指出的光辉道路，大踏步地前进。让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底肃清《修养》的流毒！
    师范大学井冈山公社代表的发言，揭穿了《修养》中所散布的“党内和平论”的反动本质，指出这种谬论是复辟资本主义的工具。他在发言中说，一部中国共产党的历史就是一部阶级斗争的历史，就是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同形形色色的“左”右倾机会主义路线斗争并不断取得胜利的历史。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，口口声声讲什么“党内和平”，但正是他，一次又一次地向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线发动了猖狂的进攻。他所讲的“党内和平”，实质就是只许阶级敌人和机会主义者向我们党，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线猖狂进攻，而不准我们无产阶级回击，同他们进行斗争；就是用修正主义的“合二而一”论代替马克思列宁主义的革命辩证法；用阶级调和论代替阶级斗争学说，抹杀党内斗争的阶级实质，鼓吹党内无原则的和平，取消党内两条路线的斗争，为他的篡党篡政的罪恶目的服务。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底摧毁《修养》，让毛泽东思想在我们的头脑中扎根。
        为公是假　为私是真
    地质学院东方红公社的代表在大会上发言，狠狠地批判了《修养》所宣扬的“要使自己的个人利益和党的利益完全一致”，以至“完全溶化”的公私溶化论。他说，毛主席教导我们：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”按毛主席的话来办，就是一心为公，就是无产阶级世界观；反过来，把个人利益放在第一位，就是一心为私，就是资产阶级世界观。党的利益和个人利益的矛盾，就是公与私的矛盾，就是无产阶级世界观与资产阶级世界观的斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的个人利益完全溶化到党的利益中，是耍了一个花招，是在党的利益这块招牌背后纳秽藏垢，发展形形色色的个人主义。“公私溶化论”就是公开地在思想领域里搞“公私合营”，以私化公，私字第一，为公是假，为私是真。这个谬论就是在“党的利益”的幌子下，提倡个人主义，想把个人利益塞进党的利益之中，“溶化”起来，使个人主义在党内合法化。这就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派假革命真反动的“公私溶化论”的实质和核心。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个谬论的流毒很广，不少干部怕字当头，怕丢“官”，怕犯错误，怕失去个人利益，因而站到资产阶级反动路线的立场上，犯了严重错误。“公私溶化论”是为推行资产阶级反动路线服务的。我们一定要发动一场规模浩大的“人民战争”，彻底批臭《修养》，大立毛泽东思想。
    中了《修养》的毒就会成为政治上的糊涂虫
    北京工农兵体育学院运动系体操班一位学员在会上以自己的亲身经历控诉了《修养》对她的毒害。她说：我在《修养》这副枷锁的长期奴役下，磨灭了无产阶级的革命意志，滋长了资产阶级个人主义、奴隶主义，变成了谨小慎微的君子，政治上的糊涂虫，以致使我在无产阶级文化大革命运动中背离了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，充当了走资本主义道路当权派的保皇兵，帮他们推行了资产阶级反动路线，成了运动的绊脚石。她说，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在《修养》中竭力鼓吹去为自己“修养”，为成为大人物而“修养”，为成为模范而“修养”。我就是这样从《修养》中找到了个人主义存在的合法的理论根据，学会了在“为党工作”的保护伞下发展个人利益的方法，产生了“公私合营”是天经地义的想法，忘记了毛主席的教导，忘记了“公私合营”是水火不相容的，不是你打倒我，就是我打倒你，二者不能共处。提倡“公私合营”，实际上就是假公营私，私字第一，保护个人利益。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为了达到他不可告人的目的，拉拢和腐蚀青年，去接受他的“公私合营”的修正主义货色，借此对抗、抵制毛主席的“全心全意”“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神。这就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派与毛主席争夺青年的一个方面，这就是两条路线的斗争。她说，我们千万不能再上《修养》的当了！我今后一定要同无产阶级革命派一起，紧紧地跟着毛主席，牢牢掌握毛泽东思想，天天读毛主席的书，用“老三篇”作为座右铭来改造世界观，真正地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，为党工作，为党战斗，再战斗！
    坚决保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想
    北京工农兵体育学院毛泽东思想兵团和北京矿业学院东方红的代表在联合发言中，愤怒地揭露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派利用他的《修养》，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。他们在发言中说，一九六二年，正当国内外阶级斗争极其尖锐的时候，正当苏联修正主义领导集团大肆攻击高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想大旗的中国共产党是“教条主义”的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，以为复辟时机已到，又把他的《修养》再版发行。再版《修养》不仅只字不提反对修正主义，反而大反“左倾机会主义”，大反“党内过火斗争”，大反“教条主义”，把矛头直接指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。发言指出：我们最懂得，毛泽东思想是指导我们革命取得胜利的唯一正确的指导思想，毛主席的正确领导是我国革命取得胜利的根本保证。对毛主席，我们就是无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们要坚决保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们要永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进，前进，再前进。头可断，血可流，我们热爱毛主席的红心永不丢！
    首都出版系统革命造反委员会代表怀着对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的满腔仇恨，控诉和揭露旧中宣部、旧文化部党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派秉承党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，不遗余力地大批地向国内外兜销《修养》，疯狂地抵制毛泽东思想的传播的滔天罪行。他说，《修养》这棵大毒草，不仅在全国各地用汉文大量印成各种开本的单行本，还用五种少数民族文字印行，翻译成七种外国文字发行到八十多个国家和地区。十七年来，《修养》总印数竟高达两千零五十四万一千册，而我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的著作《毛泽东选集》却只印了一千一百四十二万五千套。对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其爪牙们的这种极端恶劣的勾当，是可忍，孰不可忍！在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要把《修养》彻底批臭，肃清它在国内外的流毒。
    大会通过了给无产阶级革命派战友和革命同志们的呼吁书。
    呼吁书呼吁一切革命的同志立即行动起来，在彻底摧毁反革命修正主义集团的伟大决战中掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，巩固毛泽东思想的绝对权威，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进，彻底完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务。
