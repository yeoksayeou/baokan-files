Just as we are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revisionists' _Communist_ magazine hurriedly published an article titled "The Experience of the Cultural Revolution in the Soviet Union," shamelessly boasting that "socialist ideology" in the Soviet Union "occupies an absolute dominant position," that "Soviet socialist culture is now experiencing its heyday," and has reached the "stage of completing a great cultural revolution."

The _Communist_ magazine's throwing out of such "high-sounding" theories is not accidental. In essence, it is the Soviet revisionist leadership's fear that the Soviet people, influenced by the great storm of China's Cultural Revolution, will rise up to rebel against revisionism. They vainly hope that with such a baseless article, they can make the Soviet people believe that the Soviet Union has already completed its "cultural revolution" and achieved "magnificent" and "outstanding" results, and that there is no need for further "revolution." This is a monstrous lie!

What is the basis for the Soviet revisionists' boasting that they have completed a "great cultural revolution"? The article in the _Communist_ magazine devoted a large portion of its space to listing how many illiterates have been eliminated in the Soviet Union, how many intellectuals and scientific and technological workers there are, how many schools, theaters, libraries, and television centers have been established, and so on. The authors of the _Communist_ article have pulled out a whole set of figures, from which they draw the strange conclusion that "socialist ideology" in the Soviet Union "occupies an absolute dominant position." Gentlemen of the _Communist_ magazine, your logic of figures fully exposes your treacherous and deceitful faces of betraying Marxism-Leninism and cheating and fooling the Soviet people. You deliberately ignore the class nature of culture, which is a typical trick used by the bourgeoisie. If we follow your "logic," then the United States also has many schools, many theaters and cinemas, and so on. Does this mean that American culture is also "socialist"? Has the United States also completed the "Proletarian Cultural Revolution"? This is utterly absurd.

Lenin and Stalin have long said: There is no "general" culture, only the culture of a definite class.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are under the dictatorship of a definite politics. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that runs parallel to or is independent of politics, do not exist in fact."

In class society, there is and will not be classless culture. Whether proletarian culture or bourgeois culture occupies the dominant position does not depend on how many intellectuals, scientists, and schools, theaters, and propaganda agencies there are, but on what class these people and agencies belong to and for which class they serve. This is a fundamental question of principle. If they serve the proletariat, then it is proletarian culture; if they serve the bourgeoisie, then it is bourgeois culture.

Gentlemen of the _Communist_ magazine, aren't you boasting that "in just one year, 1965, 250 million people went to the theater and attended concerts"? Look at what kind of stuff your culture and art were filled with in that year!

The stage was filled with: love dramas that promoted decadent music and bourgeois love views, such as "104 Pages of Love," "Freedom of Love"; low-level decadent twist dances, shameless and vulgar can-can dances; ballet that promoted feudalistic talents and beauties; and American-style jazz music competitions and decadent "literary and artistic works" that promoted the philosophy of traitors and described the dark side of life.

This year was also the year when the decadent and corrupt culture of Western capitalist countries spread even more in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique did not consider this a shame but a glory. Look, the Soviet _Weekly_ once enthusiastically advocated that jazz music has a "great attraction" among Soviet youth; the _Soviet Culture_ newspaper even complained that jazz music in the Soviet Union has not yet formed a "true public opinion" and has progressed too "timidly," advocating that it should become a "full participant" in cultural life.

Can such dramas, such songs and dances, and such literary and artistic works that are rampant in the Soviet Union be said to be "socialist ideology" occupying an "absolute dominant position"?

The fact is that capitalist ideology occupies an absolute dominant position in the Soviet Union, yet they insist on saying that "socialist ideology" in the Soviet Union "occupies an absolute dominant position"; the fact is that capitalist culture is spreading rampantly in the Soviet Union, yet they insist on saying that "Soviet socialist culture is now experiencing its heyday"; the fact is that the traitor clique of Khrushchev and Brezhnev has usurped the leadership of the Soviet Union and carried out a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration, yet they insist on saying that the Soviet Union has reached the "stage of completing a great cultural revolution."

The gentlemen of the Soviet _Communist_ magazine are boasting of their revisionist culture, boasting of their "merits" in carrying out a capitalist restoration in the cultural sphere, just like a thief boasting of his cunning, a prostitute boasting of her depravity, and a murderer boasting of his cruelty. These Soviet traitors are nothing but, as Lenin said, "boasting of their own shame."

    “却把自己的耻辱拿来吹嘘”
    北京航空学院红旗战斗队
    正当我们轰轰烈烈地开展无产阶级文化大革命的时候，苏修《共产党人》杂志迫不及待地发表了一篇题为《苏联文化革命的经验》的文章，厚颜无耻地吹嘘什么“社会主义意识形态”在苏联“占绝对的统治地位”，“苏联的社会主义文化现在经历着全盛时期”，已经到了“伟大文化革命的完成阶段”。
    《共产党人》抛出这样的“高”论，并不是偶然的。说穿了，无非是苏修领导集团害怕苏联人民在中国伟大的文化大革命风暴的影响下，起来造修正主义的反。他们妄想用这样一篇经不起一驳的妙文叫苏联人民相信：苏联早已完成了“文化革命”，而且取得了“规模宏伟”的“杰出”成就，毋需再“进行革命了”。这是一个弥天大谎！
    苏修吹嘘已经完成了“伟大文化革命”，根据何在呢？《共产党人》的文章用了大量的篇幅罗列苏联现在已经扫除了多少文盲，拥有多少知识分子，多少科学技术工作者，建立了多少学校、剧院、图书馆和电视中心，如此等等。《共产党人》文章的作者搬出了一大堆数字，借此就得出了这个奇妙的结论：“社会主义意识形态”在苏联已经“占绝对统治地位”。《共产党人》的先生们，你们这套数字“逻辑”充分地暴露了你们背叛马列主义、欺骗和愚弄苏联人民的丑恶嘴脸。你们故意抹煞文化艺术的阶级性，这是资产阶级惯于使用的一个典型手法。如果按照你们的“逻辑”推理下去，那末在美国也有多少多少学校，多少多少剧院和电影院，等等，这样美国的文化岂不也是“社会主义”的？美国岂不是也完成了“无产阶级文化大革命”吗？这真是荒唐到了极点。
    列宁和斯大林早就说过：没有“一般性”的文化，只有一定阶级的文化。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    在阶级社会里，没有也不会有超阶级的文化。到底是无产阶级文化还是资产阶级文化占统治地位，这不取决于多少知识分子、多少科学家和学校、剧院、宣传机构，而取决于这些人和机构是属于什么阶级的，为哪个阶级服务的。这是根本的原则问题。如果是为无产阶级服务的，那就是无产阶级文化；如果是为资产阶级服务的，那就是资产阶级文化。
    《共产党人》的先生们，你们不是在夸耀“仅仅一九六五年一年，就有两亿五千万人去戏院和参加音乐会”吗？请看在这一年里，你们的文化艺术究竟充斥了什么样的货色！
    充塞着你们舞台的是：宣扬靡靡之音和资产阶级恋爱观的爱情戏剧，什么《一○四页爱情》、《爱情的自由》；低级堕落的扭摆舞、无耻下流的康笳舞。宣扬封建主义才子佳人的芭蕾舞；还有美国式的爵士音乐比赛和宣扬战争恐怖和叛徒哲学、描写生活阴暗面的颓废的“文艺作品”。
    这一年也是西方资本主义国家腐朽没落的文化在苏联更加泛滥的一年。苏修叛徒集团对此不以为耻，反以为荣。请看，苏修《周报》曾狂热地鼓吹说，爵士音乐在苏联青年中具有“巨大吸引力”；《苏维埃文化报》甚至抱怨爵士音乐在苏联尚未形成“真正舆论”，前进得太“胆怯”，鼓吹要使之成为文化生活的“全权参加者”。
    这样的戏剧，这样的歌舞，这样的文艺作品在苏联泛滥，难道能说是“社会主义意识形态”占了“绝对的统治地位”吗？
    事实明明是资本主义意识形态在苏联占绝对的统治地位，却偏偏要胡说什么“社会主义意识形态”在苏联“占绝对统治地位”；事实明明是资本主义文化正在苏联大泛滥，却偏偏要胡说什么“苏联的社会主义文化现在经历着全盛时期”；事实明明是赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫叛徒集团，篡夺了苏联的领导，实现了资本主义反革命复辟，却偏偏要胡说什么苏联已经到了“伟大文化革命的完成阶段”。
    苏修的《共产党人》先生们竟然象窃贼夸耀自己的狡猾、娼妓夸耀自己的堕落、凶手夸耀自己的残忍一样，夸耀自己的修正主义的文化，夸耀自己在文化领域内实行资本主义复辟的“功勋”。苏修这一伙叛徒们，不过是象列宁说的：“却把自己的耻辱拿来吹嘘”而已。
