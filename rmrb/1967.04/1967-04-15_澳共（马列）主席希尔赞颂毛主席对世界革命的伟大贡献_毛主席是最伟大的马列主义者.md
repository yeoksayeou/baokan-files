	Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) Chairman Hill on April 13 in the "Vanguard" stressed that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He said: "In the contemporary world, Mao Zedong's position is of decisive importance. The attitude towards him is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists, revolutionaries and modern revisionists, as well as those who want to make the working class and the laboring people adapt to capitalism."

	Hill pointed out that Chairman Mao has made tremendous contributions to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism. He wrote: "Mao Zedong is the founder of the Communist Party of China. From the beginning of his revolutionary activities, he demonstrated the insight of Marxism-Leninism and his genius in observing contemporary world and Chinese realities. He elaborated the theory of the Chinese revolution." Hill particularly mentioned that Chairman Mao drew the conclusion from reality: revolutionary forces must have an army. He said: "Based on this theory, there was the People's Liberation Army of China and its practice. This practice has completely proven the correctness of his theory. This army is a special army. Mao Zedong developed the theory that the People's Liberation Army is the main weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This theory has been proven correct in practice until the present day of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	Hill highly praised Chairman Mao's theory of "spark can start a prairie fire." He said: "The revolutionary base areas in China are the practice of this theory. The practice of China's liberation has proven the correctness of this theory."

	Hill also pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong expounded and developed the theory of the revolutionary party, the Communist Party. According to this theory, the Communist Party of China was established in practice. The Communist Party of China led the practice of liberating China, which proved the correctness of this theory."

	Hill pointed out that Chairman Mao developed the epistemology and dialectics of Marxism-Leninism in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." He also systematically developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of literature and art in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Practice has proven the correctness of these theories, and these theories have become material forces.

	Hill particularly emphasized: "Mao Zedong uniquely expounded and developed the theory that class and class struggle continue to exist in socialist society. Practice produces theory and proves theory. Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is shaking the world, is proving the correctness of this theory. The theory and practice of Mao Zedong Thought guarantee that there will be no capitalist restoration in China."

	When talking about the current international situation, Hill said: "The central contradiction in the contemporary world is the struggle of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism, primarily against American imperialism. Mao Zedong expounded the theory and practice of this struggle. Practice is proving that Mao Zedong's views are correct." Hill also emphasized: "Revisionism is the main danger to revolutionary forces. This theory of the contemporary world is a product of Mao Zedong Thought. If the brilliant Mao Zedong had not fought against Soviet modern revisionism, the disasters that revolutionary forces would suffer are unimaginable. In the past, people did not see this clearly. But Mao Zedong, with his brilliant foresight, exposed the essence of revisionism. Practice has proven him right a thousand times."

	Hill then stressed the great significance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution for China and the future of the world revolution. He pointed out that Chairman Mao has made immeasurable contributions in arousing the Chinese people to fight against modern revisionism. Without this struggle, the Chinese people would have faced the danger of capitalist restoration. But now, the masses have been mobilized, a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, and a new stage of progress for Marxism-Leninism in the world has arrived. The forces of Marxism-Leninism are advancing by leaps and bounds.

	Hill finally said: "Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism in all fields. His defense and development of the dictatorship of the proletariat have provided the oppressed peoples of the world with an extremely powerful weapon in liberated China." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon."

    澳共（马列）主席希尔赞颂毛主席对世界革命的伟大贡献
    毛主席是最伟大的马列主义者
    新华社墨尔本十三日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔十三日在《先锋报》上发表文章强调指出，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他说：“在当代世界上，毛泽东的地位具有决定意义的重要性。对待他的态度，是把马克思列宁主义者、革命者同现代修正主义者以及那些要使工人阶级和劳动人民适应资本主义的人区别开来的分水岭。”
    希尔指出，毛主席对马克思列宁主义的宝库作出了巨大的贡献。他写道：“毛泽东是中国共产党的创始人。他一开始从事革命活动，就以马克思列宁主义的洞察能力和他的天才观察当代世界和中国的现实。他阐明了中国革命的理论。”希尔特别提到，毛主席从现实得出结论：革命力量必须拥有军队。他说：“根据这一理论，就有了中国人民解放军及其实践。这个实践完全证实了他的理论的正确。这支军队是一支特殊的军队。毛泽东发展了解放军是无产阶级专政的主要武器的理论。这个理论直到进行无产阶级文化大革命的现在，从实践方面证明一直是正确的。”
    希尔高度赞扬毛主席的星星之火可以燎原的理论。他说：“中国革命的根据地就是这个理论的实践。在中国解放的实践中已经证明了这个理论的正确。”
    希尔还指出：“毛泽东同志阐述和发展了革命政党共产党的理论。按照这个理论，中国共产党在实践中建立了起来。中国共产党领导解放中国的实践，证明了这一理论的正确性。”
    希尔指出，毛主席在《实践论》和《矛盾论》中发展了马克思列宁主义的认识论和辩证法。并且在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中系统地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论。实践证明了这些理论的正确性，这些理论已经变成物质力量。
    希尔特别强调指出：“毛泽东独一无二地阐述和发展了关于在社会主义社会中阶级和阶级斗争继续存在的理论。实践产生理论并证实理论。今天，震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命正在证明这一理论的正确性。毛泽东思想的理论和实践保证中国不会发生资本主义复辟。”
    希尔在谈到当前国际形势时说：“当前世界的中心矛盾，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫人民反对帝国主义，首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争。毛泽东阐述了这一斗争的理论和实践。实践正在证明毛泽东的观点是正确的。”希尔还着重指出：“修正主义是革命力量的主要危险。当代世界的这个理论，是毛泽东思想的产物。如果天才的毛泽东不向苏联现代修正主义斗争，革命力量遭受的灾难是可想而知的。过去，（人们）并没有很清楚地看到这一点。但是毛泽东以他的天才的远见，揭露了修正主义的本质。实践千百次地证明他是正确的。”
    希尔然后强调中国的无产阶级文化大革命对中国和世界革命前途的重大意义。他指出，毛主席在唤起中国人民进行反对现代修正主义斗争方面作出了不可估量的贡献。如果没有这场斗争，中国人民就会面临资本主义复辟的危险。但是，现在群众已经发动起来了，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已经被揪出来了，中国的前途和全世界马克思列宁主义的前进的新阶段已经到来了，马克思列宁主义的力量正在突飞猛进。
    希尔最后说：“毛泽东在各个领域内都发展了马克思列宁主义。他对无产阶级专政的保卫和发展，使全世界被压迫人民在解放了的中国找到了一件无比强大的武器。”他说，毛泽东思想“就是指路明灯”。
