To implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" policy is a great policy put forward by Chairman Mao. It is the political and organizational guarantee for the revolutionary masses to win in the struggle for power. However, in some places and departments, there have been obstacles. Where do these obstacles come from?

The main obstacles come from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In the early stages of the movement, they on the one hand instigated the masses to fight among themselves, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." On the other hand, they maliciously implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group," instigating the masses to fight against cadres, causing a large number of cadres to be sidelined, and some were even labeled as "power-seekers," "anti-Party elements," and so on. As the movement developed to the stage where the revolutionary masses seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they spread rumors, shot dark arrows, and did everything they could to strike down those revolutionary cadres who stood out first, attempting to sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one" policy.

To implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" policy, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group," especially to criticize, expose, and overthrow the number one capitalist roader within the Party who proposed this reactionary line.

The news from our newspaper: In the struggle for power, the "Break Private and Establish Public" Combat Team of the Guizhou Province Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau, in response to the active thoughts within the revolutionary masses, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, ensuring the correct implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one" policy. Is it to follow the mass line or to have a few people decide the list?

How to correctly handle cadres? This has been a major issue that the combat team has been considering since its establishment. However, at the beginning, a few responsible comrades of the combat team were afraid that the masses would suspect them of not drawing clear lines, and when doing cadre work, they would dodge and evade. Sometimes, when they talked to a relatively good cadre, they would not dare to do so in the office. As a result, not only did a few relatively good cadres hesitate to come forward, but there were also many opinions within the combat team. Some people suspected that the few responsible comrades of the team headquarters were "colluding with the authorities," criticizing the team headquarters for being "rightist." Hearing such comments, the few responsible comrades did not know what to do for a moment, so they retreated, and even announced at the full team meeting: "From now on, no responsible comrade of our team headquarters will have individual contact with any of the authorities. If we need to talk, we will do so together."

Where exactly is the problem? The responsible comrades of the combat team, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's works together. Chairman Mao said: "To examine cadres, if it is done by only a few people in the leading organs of the Organization Department in isolation, it will certainly not be done well; if it is done through the administrative leaders of a certain organ or school, mobilizing many personnel and many students of that organ or school, sometimes even all the personnel and all the students, and the leading comrades of the higher-level Organization Department correctly guide this examination, implementing the principle of combining leadership with the masses, the purpose of examining cadres will certainly be fully achieved." Chairman Mao's teachings helped them find the answer to the problem, making their minds clear.

In mid-February, the bureau office was considering the establishment of a revolutionary committee, and someone suggested that the team headquarters set a scope. The team headquarters accepted the past lessons, based on Chairman Mao's teachings of "implementing the principle of combining leadership with the masses," rejected the method of relying on a few people to decide the "three-in-one" list, and instead let the revolutionary masses first put forward the list. Then, the team headquarters convened a meeting of the combat team (group) leaders to concentrate the opinions of the masses, and then handed the concentrated opinions to the revolutionary masses for discussion. Through such repeated discussions from the bottom up and from the top down, the masses grasped Chairman Mao's cadre policy, their eyes were the brightest, and their attitudes were the most fair, selecting the most suitable cadre candidates, and finally producing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. Is it to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one" or to combine for the sake of combining?

When the revolutionary masses began to consider the establishment of a revolutionary committee, because at that time there were examples of "three-in-one" joint seizure of power in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, and Guizhou, everyone knew that they should implement the "three-in-one." However, they did not fully understand the importance of implementing the "three-in-one," and some people wanted to do what they called "as much combination as possible." They said, "If there are conditions, we will do 'three-in-one'; if not, we will do 'two-in-one'; if it really doesn't work, we will not combine."

At this time, the journal *Red Flag* brought us the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on seizing power and correctly handling cadres. Chairman Mao said: In places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary "three-in-one" policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. The name of this power organ is best called the revolutionary committee. The combat team immediately organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions, and combined with the specific situation of their department, they held a debate. On the one hand, everyone used the method of class analysis to rank and analyze the leading cadres one by one, finding that the authorities were not a solid bloc, and only a handful truly needed to be overthrown. Some people, although they had this or that flaw, were ultimately revolutionary and should be allowed to revolutionize and help them correct their mistakes. Some revolutionary cadres had even been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We should believe in these comrades and help these comrades. As long as we proletarian revolutionaries firmly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, enthusiastically help revolutionary leading cadres to revolutionize, the conditions for "three-in-one" are fully met. On the other hand, everyone reviewed the work of the previous period, deeply feeling that with the development of the struggle situation, the proletarian revolutionaries must truly grasp power and use power well, and must combine those revolutionary leading cadres who are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, and have richer struggle experience into the leadership core.

When emphasizing the combination with revolutionary leading cadres, some people again had the idea of combining for the sake of combining, wanting to forcibly pull in a deputy bureau chief who had not properly examined his mistakes. In response to this situation, the combat team immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on seizing power and correctly handling cadres, especially studying the formula of "unity-criticism-unity." Everyone unanimously agreed that "picking a general from a group of short people," regardless of whether the erroneous cadres had recognized and corrected their mistakes, would abandon revolutionary principles. Doing "three-in-one" in this way would allow those who insisted on their mistakes, had not drawn a clear line with the capitalist roaders, and had not drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line to mix into the revolutionary ranks, and would even give a handful of capitalist roaders a chance to sneak in. Such a "three-in-one" temporary power organ established in this way would never be able to lead the broad revolutionary masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. After the understanding was unified, everyone decided to temporarily not combine with this deputy bureau chief, but to arrange for him to do some work first and help him continue to examine his mistakes. Is it to help cadres come forward or to wait for cadres to come forward?

In the struggle to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one," the combat team also encountered the problem of some revolutionary leading cadres not daring to come forward. Especially, there was a deputy bureau chief who, although labeled as a "counter-revolutionary" by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the early stages of the movement, still could not stand up.

Why couldn't they stand up? Everyone, with this question in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the attitude towards erroneous cadres, and many comrades thought of their own distant attitude towards some leading cadres, which was obviously not conducive to uniting the majority of cadres. The combat team also analyzed the active thoughts of relatively good leading cadres one by one, finding that the reason they dared not come forward was still the fear of the word "fear" and the selfishness of the word "self." To make them stand up and rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line, they must first guide them to rebel against the word "self" in their minds.

In response to this situation, the comrades of the combat team unanimously agreed that they should no longer wait for revolutionary cadres, but should actively approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Therefore, the combat team sent a few team members to study the "Three Articles" with these cadres, first winning the battle against the word "self" in their minds. At the same time, they convened a meeting with cadres and masses who knew them relatively well to clarify the facts exposed in the big-character posters in the past, exposing the plot of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" played by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Next, the combat team arranged for a few meetings for them to examine and expose, consciously guiding them to throw themselves into the great waves of mass struggle, undergo tests, and receive tempering. They seriously criticized their shortcomings and mistakes, encouraged their revolutionary actions of counterattack, and promptly approved their participation in the combat team according to their applications for those leading cadres who performed well. In this way, those revolutionary leading cadres put down their burdens and joined the proletarian revolutionary struggle for power with light hearts.

    贵州有色金属工业管理局无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻革命“三结合”方针
    团结大多数　打击一小撮
    革命的领导干部放下包袱，轻装上阵，投入夺权斗争第一线
    编者按：实行革命的“三结合”，是毛主席提出的伟大方针，是无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争胜利的政治保证和组织保证。但是，在一些地方和一些部门，却遇到了阻力。阻力来自哪里？
    阻力主要来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在运动初期，他们一方面挑动群众斗群众，把革命群众打成“反革命”，一方面恶毒地推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗干部，使大批干部靠边站，有的甚至被打成“伸手派”、“反党分子”等等。运动发展到无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的阶段，他们更是造谣言，放暗箭，千方百计地打击那些首先站出来的革命干部，妄图破坏革命的“三结合”。
    要实行革命的“三结合”，必须彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，尤其要把提出这条反动路线的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，批深、批透、批倒、批臭。
    本报讯　贵州省有色金属工业管理局“破私立公”战斗团在夺权斗争中，针对革命派内部的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，保证了革命的“三结合”方针正确贯彻执行。是走群众路线，还是少数人圈定名单
    怎样正确对待干部？是这个战斗团成立以来经常考虑的一个重大问题。但是，开始时，战斗团几个负责人怕群众怀疑自己划不清界限，做干部工作时躲躲闪闪，有时找个比较好的领导干部谈话，也不敢在办公室里谈。这样做的结果，不但几个比较好的领导干部迟迟不敢站出来，战斗团内部也意见纷纷。有人怀疑团部几个负责人“与当权派勾勾搭搭”，批评团部“右倾”。听到这样的议论，几个负责人一时也不知怎么办，于是打了退堂鼓，甚至在全团大会上宣布：“今后我们团部任何负责人，都不单独和那一个当权派接触，要谈大家在一起谈。”
    究竟问题在那里呢？战斗团的负责人带着这个问题，一块学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“审查干部，如果仅仅由组织部这个领导机关的少数人孤立地去做，必不可能做好；如果通过某一机关或某一学校的行政负责人，推动该机关该学校的许多人员、许多学生，有时甚至是全体人员、全体学生都参加审查，而上级组织部的领导人员则正确地指导这种审查，实行领导和群众相结合的原则，审查干部的目的就一定能完满地达到。”毛主席的教导帮助他们找到了问题的答案，使他们心里豁然开朗了。
    二月中旬，局机关酝酿成立革命委员会，有人提出希望团部定个范围。团部接受了过去的教训，根据毛主席的教导“实行领导和群众相结合的原则”，拒绝了那种依靠少数人圈定“三结合”名单的作法，而是让革命群众先提出名单，然后由团部召开战斗队（组）长会议集中群众意见，再把集中的意见交给革命群众讨论。经过这样自下而上、自上而下地反复讨论，群众掌握了毛主席的干部政策，他们眼睛最亮，态度最公正，挑选出了最合适的干部人选，最后产生了一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。是实行革命的三结合，还是为结合而结合
    在革命群众开始酝酿成立革命委员会的时候，因为当时有山西、黑龙江、贵州等地“三结合”联合夺权的榜样，大家知道应该实行“三结合”，但是，对于实行“三结合”的重要意义还认识不足，有些人想搞所谓“尽量结合”。他们说：“有条件就三结合，不行就搞两结合，实在不行我们就不结合。”
    正在这个时候，《红旗》杂志传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席有关夺权和正确对待干部的最新指示。毛主席说：在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。战斗团立即组织大家认真学习了毛主席的这一指示，结合本部门的具体情况展开了辩论。一方面，大家用阶级分析的方法对领导干部逐个进行了排队分析，发现当权派并非铁板一块，真正要打倒的只是一小撮。有些人虽然有这样或那样的缺点，但终究是要革命的，应当允许他们革命，帮助他们改正错误。有的革命干部还曾经被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打成“反革命”，我们更应该相信这些同志，帮助这些同志。只要我们无产阶级革命派坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，热情帮助革命领导干部起来革命，搞“三结合”的条件是完全具备的。另一方面，大家回顾了前一段的工作，深深感到随着斗争形势的发展，无产阶级革命派要真正掌好权，用好权，必须把那些政治上比较成熟，组织能力较强，斗争经验比较丰富的革命领导干部结合到领导核心中来。
    当强调和革命的领导干部相结合的时候，有些人又产生了为结合而结合的想法，想把一个没有很好检查错误的副局长硬拉进来。针对这种情况，战斗团又及时组织大家学习了毛主席有关夺权和正确对待干部的指示，特别是学习了“团结——批评——团结”的公式。大家一致认为，“矮子里面拔将军”，不管犯错误的干部是否认识和改正了错误，就同他们结合，这就放弃了革命原则。这样去搞“三结合”，就会让那些坚持错误，没有同走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，没有同资产阶级反动路线划清界限的人混进革命派队伍里来，甚至还会给一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派钻空子。这样建立起来的“三结合”临时权力机构，决不可能率领广大革命群众将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。认识统一以后，大家决定暂时不同这个副局长结合，先安排他做一定的工作，帮助他继续检查错误。是帮助干部亮相，还是等待干部亮相
    在实现革命的“三结合”的斗争中，战斗团还碰到了一些革命领导干部不敢亮相的问题。特别是有一位副局长，尽管在运动初期被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打成“反革命”，但是也迟迟站不起来。
    他们为什么站不起来呢？大家带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席关于正确对待犯错误干部的态度问题的教导，不少同志联想到自己对某些领导干部采取疏远的态度，只是消极等待他们亮相，这显然是不利于团结大多数干部的。战斗团又对比较好的领导干部的活思想进行了逐一的分析，发现他们不敢亮相的原因还是怕字当头，私字作怪，要让他们起来造资产阶级反动路线的反，首先要引导他们起来造自己头脑中“私”字的反。
    针对这种情况，战斗团的同志一致认为，对革命干部不应该再等待下去了，而应该按照毛主席的教导，主动地亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。于是，战斗团派了几个队员专门跟这些干部一起学习“老三篇”，首先打好头脑中兴无灭资这一仗。同时，召集比较了解他们的干部、群众座谈，澄清过去大字报上揭发的事实，戳穿了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所玩弄的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的阴谋。接着，战斗团又安排了几次大会让他们检查、揭发，有意识地引导他们投身到群众斗争的大风大浪中去，经受考验，接受锻炼。对他们的缺点和错误进行了严肃的批判，对他们回戈反击的革命行动进行了鼓励。对表现好的领导干部，根据他们的申请，及时批准他们参加战斗团。这样就使那些革命的领导干部放下了包袱，轻装投入无产阶级革命派夺权斗争。
