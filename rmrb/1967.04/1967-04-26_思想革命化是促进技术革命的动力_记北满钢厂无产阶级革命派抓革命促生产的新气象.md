The proletarian revolutionary faction of Beiman Steel Plant, after seizing power, resolutely opposed the conservative sentiment of maintaining the status quo. They continued to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, promote ideological revolutionization, and use revolution to lead production, launching a high tide of production technology innovation.

Nothing Can Stop Us

March was the second month after the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory seized power. With the significant increase in steel and steel product output, the supply of scrap steel used for steelmaking became insufficient. According to the old framework, one furnace of steel must have 30% scrap steel in the raw materials. Now, with the shortage of scrap steel, some of those in power who took the capitalist road were laughing on the side, and some bourgeois reactionary "authorities" were also coldly mocking.

Would we bow down in the face of difficulties? The revolutionary workers of the first workshop said, no difficulty can stop us revolutionary workers. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." They resolutely broke through the old framework, reducing the scrap steel ratio from 30% to 15%. In this technological innovation process, the old worker and Communist Party member Wang Bidan was elected by the revolutionary masses as a production service worker. He stayed in the workshop day and night, working with everyone to make detailed improvements in technology, quickly producing steel that fully meets national quality standards under the condition of reduced scrap steel ratio.

The steel was smelted, but the smelting time was extended. "Time is steel!" By March 10th, according to the monthly plan, there were still more than 3,000 tons of steel to be completed for the entire month. The revolutionary service team of this workshop immediately posted a big-character poster, mobilizing everyone to solve this problem.

All the revolutionary workers in the workshop were mobilized. Worker Zhou Defang, who had just returned to work after a sick leave, voluntarily requested to work day and night shifts and proposed to conduct a "rapid steelmaking performance." Zhou Defang had technical experience, but in the past, he was suppressed by a small clique of those in power within the party who took the capitalist road. During the Cultural Revolution, Zhou Defang engaged in a head-on struggle with this small clique within the party who took the capitalist road, and overthrew them. His mind was liberated, and his wisdom and strength were fully realized. He carefully improved the operating technology, accelerated the melting of steel, and shortened the steelmaking time. Inspired by him, the steelmaking time in the entire workshop was generally shortened. In March, this workshop completed the steelmaking task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota, and the entire factory fully completed the national production plan.

Dare to Tackle the Toughest Problems

In the second workshop, there was a generator that had been malfunctioning for several years, but no one dared to touch it. In the past, a small clique of those in power within the party who took the capitalist road did not see the wisdom and strength of the worker masses, saying that "the tiger's buttocks are untouchable." After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they dared to think and act, quickly fixing it.

This generator is the power source for the main rolling mill's slabbing machine. In the past, when the rolling volume increased, it would malfunction. Before repairing this generator, the proletarian revolutionary workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious,' and the Communist Party is the most serious about it." The revolutionary workers, technicians, and engineers formed a three-in-one combination team, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the generator, and formulated a repair plan. They both strategically despised difficulties and tactically took difficulties seriously, fully preparing before disassembling and repairing.

"Without entering the tiger's den, how can one catch the tiger cub?" The daring revolutionary workers, after carefully studying the generator after disassembling it, quickly found that the problem with the generator was that the "brush distance" deviation was too large and needed adjustment. They boldly adjusted the "brush distance," and in just three days, they solved this long-standing difficult problem that had not been solved before.

Now this generator is running normally. The concern that increasing the rolling volume would definitely cause the generator to malfunction was eliminated, and the mechanical potential was fully utilized. In the face of facts, those bourgeois gentlemen also had to admit defeat.

Brave Shouldering of Heavy Burdens to Overcome Difficulties

In the Cultural Revolution, worker technician Li Baoyin of the fourth workshop demonstrated a great sense of responsibility as a master, bravely shouldering heavy burdens, and together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the workshop, on the one hand, he thoroughly criticized a small clique of those in power within the party who took the capitalist road, and on the other hand, he vigorously promoted technological innovation. In the past, because Li Baoyin was dissatisfied with the revisionist line pursued by a small clique of those in power within the party, they excluded and attacked Li Baoyin, spreading the word that "Li Baoyin is old, and his experience is no longer useful." However, Li Baoyin often said to others, "In the Cultural Revolution, I feel younger and younger." He studied the "Three Articles" as his motto, inspiring himself with the communist spirit of Dr. Bethune. The large crane in the workshop used tower-type springs, which, due to long-term use, had reduced elasticity, affecting the production of large steel parts. For several years, a small clique of those in power within the party who took the capitalist road did not seriously solve this problem and had to transfer the production of large steel parts to other factories. After seizing power, Li Baoyin and the revolutionary workers and revolutionary technicians of the workshop formed a technological innovation breakthrough team. Without asking the state for money, they used the steel materials of their own factory to successfully trial-manufacture tower-type springs, solving the key production problem. After the new springs were installed, they could produce large steel parts weighing more than 25 tons, creating favorable conditions for expanding the variety of steel products.

    思想革命化是促进技术革命的动力
    ——记北满钢厂无产阶级革命派抓革命促生产的新气象
    北满钢厂无产阶级革命派在夺权后，坚决反对维持现状的保守情绪，继续不断地用毛泽东思想武装头脑，促进思想革命化，用革命统帅生产，掀起了革新生产技术的高潮。
    什么困难也难不倒
    三月份，是这个工厂无产阶级革命派夺权以后的第二个月。随着钢和钢材产量的大幅度增加，炼钢用的配比废钢有些不足。按照老框框，炼一炉钢必须有百分之三十的废钢配到炼钢的原料里才行。现在废钢不足，有的走资本主义道路的当权派在一旁看笑话，有的资产阶级反动“权威”也在一旁冷嘲热讽。
    难道在困难面前低头吗？第一车间革命派工人说，什么困难也难不倒我们革命工人。他们遵照毛主席“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，坚决突破了老框框，把废钢配比率由百分之三十降为百分之十五。在这一技术革新的过程中，老工人、共产党员王百旦，被革命群众推选为生产服务员。他昼夜不离车间，和大家一起在技术上做了细致的改进，很快就在减少废钢配比的情况下，炼出完全合乎国家质量标准的钢来。
    钢炼出来了，但冶炼时间有些延长。“时间就是钢！”这时已经是三月十日，按照月计划，离完成全月任务还差三千多吨钢。这个车间的革命派服务小组马上贴出大字报，发动大家解决这个问题。
    全车间革命工人都动起来了。因病休养刚刚上班的工人邹德芳，主动要求昼夜顶班劳动，并提出要进行“快速炼钢表演”。邹德芳有技术经验，可是过去却受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的压制。文化大革命运动中邹德芳同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了针锋相对的斗争，造了他们的反。他的思想解放了，智慧和力量也就得到充分发挥。他精心改进操作技术，加速钢的熔化，缩短了炼钢时间。在他的启发下，全车间的炼钢时间普遍缩短。三月份，这个车间提前超额完成了炼钢任务，全厂也全面完成了国家生产计划。
    老虎屁股偏要摸
    在第二车间，有一台发电机几年来总出毛病，可是从来没人敢动它。过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派看不到工人群众的智慧和力量，说什么“老虎屁股摸不得”。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，敢想敢干，很快就把它修好了。
    这个发电机是主轧机开坯机的动力来源。过去轧钢量一增多，它就出毛病。无产阶级革命派工人在修理这台发电机之前，反复学习了毛主席的教导：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”革命工人和技术员、工程师组成一个三结合小组，对发电机进行了全面的分析，制定了修理方案。他们既在战略上藐视困难，又在战术上重视困难，拆修之前做了充分的准备工作。
      “不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。敢想敢干的革命职工，把发电机拆开来进行了认真的研究之后，很快就找到发电机的毛病是“刷距”距离误差太大，必须调整。他们大胆地调整了“刷距”，只用三天时间就把这个长期没有解决的老大难问题解决了。
    现在这个发电机运行正常。有些人认为增加轧钢量发电机就一定会出毛病的顾虑解除了，机械潜力得到充分发挥。在事实面前，那些资产阶级老爷们也不得不低头认输。
    勇挑重担攻难关
    第四车间工人技师李宝印在文化大革命中发挥主人翁的伟大责任感，勇挑重担，同车间无产阶级革命派一起，一方面大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，一方面大搞技术革新。过去，由于李宝印对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行的修正主义路线不满，他们就排斥、打击李宝印，并散布说：“李宝印老了，他的那套经验不中用了。”可是，李宝印却经常向别人说，在文化大革命中，我越来越感到自己年轻了。他把“老三篇”当做座右铭来学，以白求恩同志的共产主义精神激励自己。车间里大型吊车上用的塔式弹簧，由于长期使用，弹性下降，影响大钢件的生产。几年来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派根本不认真解决这个问题，只好把大钢件转到其它工厂去生产。夺权以后，李宝印和车间革命工人、革命技术人员组成一个技术革新攻关小组，没向国家要钱，利用本厂的钢料试制成功了塔式弹簧，解决了生产关键问题。新试制的弹簧安装好以后，就可以生产二十五吨以上的大型钢件，给扩大钢材品种创造了有利条件。
