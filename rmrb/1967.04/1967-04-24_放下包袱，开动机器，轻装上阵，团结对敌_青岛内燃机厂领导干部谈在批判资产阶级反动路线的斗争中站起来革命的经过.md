In the current struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the party's top capitalist-roader, how can revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line, and cadres who have executed the bourgeois reactionary line, put down their burdens, bravely stand up, and join the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line? Recently, several leading cadres from the Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory who have stood up in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line shared their experiences with reporters from this newspaper on how they solved this problem by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Study of Problems."

To put down the burden, one must first overcome the "private" self.

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, Wang Jiaxiang, the deputy director of the One-Horsepower Workshop, who had been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line, said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "To win new victories, we must advocate putting down the burden and starting the machine among the party cadres." Why couldn't I put down my burden and dare to fire at the bourgeois reactionary line before January this year? The main reason lies in the "private" self. To put down the burden, one must first overcome the "private" self.

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, I was attacked and persecuted because I supported revolutionary workers in posting big-character posters against the work team. During that period, the work team and a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the factory incited the unaware masses to hold six large meetings to struggle against me and more than twenty small meetings. They fabricated facts and tried every means to label me as a "counter-revolutionary."

The persecution and attacks by the bourgeois reactionary line also aroused my anger. I wanted to engage in a head-on struggle with them. But then I thought, "The arm cannot twist the thigh." If I couldn't win, I would only be "guilty on top of guilty." Fearing "wrong on top of wrong" and more brutal persecution, I restrained myself as much as possible, following the deceitful words in "Self-Cultivation," being "most lenient, tolerant, and 'accommodating' towards comrades," even enduring various misunderstandings and humiliations without any resentment. I was poisoned by "Self-Cultivation," starting from personal safety, not daring to rise up and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, but placing my hopes on the "screening" and "rehabilitation" in the later stages of the movement.

In November last year, after the first revolutionary mass organization "Heart Towards the Party" Fighting Squad was established in our factory, revolutionary comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction mobilized me, saying, "You are a cadre persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line and should bravely stand up with us to fire at the bourgeois reactionary line!" At that time, I thought: I have been struggled against many times. If I openly stand with the revolutionary faction, the conservatives will all charge at me, saying I am stirring up trouble and trying to grab straws. How can I bear it? In short, it was the "private" self that bound me, becoming a heavy burden on my shoulders, making me dare not stand up to revolution.

Should I submit to the pressure of the bourgeois reactionary line, or should I bravely stand with the proletarian revolutionary faction to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line? For a long time, my thoughts were in fierce struggle. Just when my thoughts were in the most intense struggle, I studied Chairman Mao's "On the Study of Problems." Chairman Mao said, "What is meant by putting down the burden is that we should get rid of many of our spiritual burdens." Reviewing the early days of the Cultural Revolution, my greatest spiritual burden was the "private" self. I did not realize that the persecution and attacks by the bourgeois reactionary line were manifestations of fierce class struggle, but wrongly thought it was the persecution and attacks by a few individuals, thus only being dissatisfied with those who attacked me, not finding the root of this reactionary line, not making up my mind to fight the bourgeois reactionary line to the end, calculating personal gains and losses, fearing being labeled a "counter-revolutionary," fearing being "expelled from the party," fearing being framed, and so on. Countless worries suppressed my revolutionary spirit. These "private" thoughts must be overcome, and the worldview of selflessness must be established; otherwise, it is impossible to truly understand and execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. These private thoughts must be overcome, or else it is impossible to put down the burden and lighten the load. With the patient help of comrades from the proletarian revolutionary faction, I repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," fiercely fought against the "private" and "fear" thoughts, and established the "public" and "dare" spirits. From January this year, I actively participated in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, exposing and accusing the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Soon, I was absorbed into the revolutionary mass organization and recently was elected as a member of the workshop revolutionary mass organization. I realized that we cadres who have been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line can only break with the private and establish the public, starting from the interests of the proletariat, to understand the struggle between the two lines, to make up our minds to fight the bourgeois reactionary line to the end, and to charge forward bravely in the struggle.

Smash the spiritual shackles of "Self-Cultivation."

Wang Jun, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory and former factory director, said: In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, I was poisoned by "Self-Cultivation," bound by the so-called "distinction between inside and outside" and "organizational discipline," and became a "tame tool" for a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, unconsciously executing the bourgeois reactionary line. I felt that cadres who were deceived must put down their burdens and lighten their loads, and must thoroughly smash the spiritual shackles of "Self-Cultivation," this counter-revolutionary revisionist work, and truly follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "To eliminate the heavy blindness in our party, we must advocate thinking, learn to analyze things, and cultivate the habit of analysis."

Soon after the Cultural Revolution began, the work team dispatched by the original Qingdao Municipal Committee's Industrial and Transportation Political Department to our factory immediately used the "strike a large area, protect a few" trick. In less than two months, 30% of the revolutionary cadres in the entire factory were attacked. At that time, I thought: Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Twenty-three Articles," which clearly point out that good and relatively good cadres are the majority. Our factory had just completed the Four Clean-ups, why did the work team see our cadre team as all black? I couldn't understand, so I went to the work team and expressed my views. However, I was sternly rebuked by the work team.

I hit a snag and my heart was in turmoil. I thought: It's all my fault for meddling and loving to give advice. In the past, I suffered losses in this aspect, and now I have to "cultivate myself well." So, I participated in the movement during the day and read "Self-Cultivation" diligently at night. I thought: "The work team is sent by the higher-level party committee, could they make mistakes? Besides, even if they really made a mistake, I am a Communist Party member and should obey the organization!" With the attitude of preferring to make mistakes in political lines rather than in organizational lines, every word, every action, and every decision I made were subject to the will and facial expressions of the work team.

In December last year, the proletarian revolutionary faction in our factory rose up. Under the impact of the revolutionary tide, I put down "Self-Cultivation" and studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Study of Problems." Chairman Mao said, "Everything should be thought through carefully." Chairman Mao also said in "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Communist Party members should ask 'why' about everything, ... absolutely not follow blindly, absolutely not advocate slavishness." The more I read, the more I felt I couldn't be fooled by "Self-Cultivation" anymore.

With the enthusiastic help of revolutionary masses, I cleared up the harm caused by "Self-Cultivation," broke the spiritual shackles that bound me from standing up to revolution, reviewed the errors I made in the previous period due to being deceived, and decided to thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary masses did not discriminate against me for being deceived. On the contrary, they enthusiastically helped me. In February, the proletarian revolutionary faction absorbed me into the revolutionary organization and appointed me as a member of the factory revolutionary committee.

In the revolutionary big criticism, reform oneself.

In the Cultural Revolution, Wan Binnan, the former party branch secretary of the Foundry Workshop, who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, said: Due to my worldview not being well reformed, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, I became a tool of the bourgeois reactionary line. After the work team was driven out of the factory by the revolutionary masses, I participated in several "black meetings" convened by the work team, plotting how to deal with the revolutionary masses, and committed serious errors.

Towards the end of last year, as the revolution deepened, the revolutionary masses exposed the cover of the "underground work team" in the factory. Later, through the rehabilitation of the revolutionary masses, I began to realize my crimes of fabricating facts, catching wind and shadows, and framing revolutionary comrades under the manipulation of the work team, and began to realize that I had executed a bourgeois reactionary line in the previous period, wanting to make a thorough confession and stand up to revolution again. However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party in our factory threatened me, saying, "Do you still want to stand up? I heard that the revolutionary faction is preparing to deal with you, and your name is also on their list of demotions!" This made me a bit afraid. I thought: Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the work team has implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, and everything is related to me. The work team directs from behind the scenes, and I execute in front. If the revolutionary faction deals with me according to my crimes, can I be spared? But then I thought, if I don't put down these burdens and dare not stand with the revolutionary masses, I would just fall into the trap of the class enemy. Chairman Mao said, "If one makes a mistake, one should demand correction, the faster and more thorough the correction, the better." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for me and gave me great encouragement and strength. Comrades from the proletarian revolutionary faction also timely helped me with my active thoughts. They, starting from the desire for unity, held three meetings, exposing and criticizing my errors in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. They also enthusiastically pointed out that I am not only an executor of the bourgeois reactionary line but also a victim of the bourgeois reactionary line, encouraging me to make up my mind to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and thoroughly break with the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. Through several exposures and criticisms, I realized that the errors were made by myself, but the root cause was in the party's number one capitalist-roader and the bourgeois reactionary line he formulated. The revolutionary masses criticized me not because they had anything against me, but to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line to the end. Once I understood this, I put down my burden and felt relaxed. I made four inspections and confessions to the revolutionary masses and at the same time exposed and accused the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Now I deeply feel that only by thoroughly breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line and standing with the revolutionary masses to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line deeply and thoroughly, can my errors be corrected quickly and thoroughly. In this revolutionary big criticism movement, I am determined to continue to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "put down the burden, start the machine," stand with the revolutionary masses, and launch a fierce attack on the party's top capitalist-roader and the bourgeois reactionary line he proposed, and in the great waves of class struggle, achieve thorough self-reform.

    放下包袱，开动机器，轻装上阵，团结对敌
    青岛内燃机厂领导干部谈在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中站起来革命的经过
    在当前向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开的大批判斗争中，受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的革命干部，和执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，怎样才能放下包袱，勇敢地站起来和革命群众一道向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火？最近，青岛内燃机厂几位在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中站起来革命的领导干部，向本社记者畅谈了他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席的《学习和时局》等光辉著作，解决这一问题的体会。
    要想放下包袱必须斗倒“私”字
    在文化大革命初期，曾经遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的一马力车间副主任王嘉祥说：毛主席教导我们：“为了争取新的胜利，要在党的干部中间提倡放下包袱和开动机器。”今年元月以前，为什么我放不下包袱，不敢向资产阶级反动路线开火？原因主要就在“私”字上。要想放下包袱，必须首先斗倒“私”字。
    我在文化大革命初期，因为支持革命工人给工作组贴大字报，而遭到围攻和迫害。在那段时间里，工作组和厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑动不明真相的群众，开大会斗了我六次，小会斗了我二三十次。他们捏造事实，千方百计要把我打成“反革命”。
    资产阶级反动路线对我的迫害和打击，也曾激起了我的愤怒。我也想同他们展开针锋相对的斗争。但是，又一想，胳膊扭不过大腿，要是斗不过他们反而会“罪加一等”。因为怕“错上加错”，怕受到更残酷的迫害，我尽量克制自己，照着欺人之谈的《修养》说的那样，“对待同志最能宽大、容忍和‘委曲求全’，甚至在必要的时候能够忍受各种误解和屈辱而毫无怨恨之心。”我中了《修养》的毒，从个人安危出发，不敢奋起批判资产阶级反动路线，而把希望寄托在运动后期的“甄别”和“平反”上。
    去年十一月，我们厂第一个革命群众组织“心向党”战斗队成立以后，无产阶级革命派同志曾经动员我说：“你是受资产阶级反动路线迫害的干部，应该勇敢地站起来和我们一道向资产阶级反动路线开火！”当时我想：我被斗过许多次，要是我公开和革命派站在一条线上，保守派都照我冲来，说我兴风作浪，想捞稻草，我怎么受得了？总之，是“私”字束缚了我，成为压在我身上的沉重的包袱，使我不敢站起来革命。
    是屈服于资产阶级反动路线的压力，还是勇敢地同无产阶级革命派站在一起批判资产阶级反动路线？在很长一段时间里，我的思想上进行着激烈的斗争。就在我思想斗争最激烈的时刻，我学习了毛主席的《学习和时局》一文。毛主席说：“所谓放下包袱，就是说，我们精神上的许多负担应该加以解除。”回顾前段文化大革命，我精神上的最大的负担是“私”字。我没有认识到资产阶级反动路线对我的迫害和打击是激烈的阶级斗争的表现，而是错误地认为这是某些个别的人对我的迫害和打击，因而，只是对打击我的几个人不满，没有找到这条反动路线的根源，没有下定同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底的决心，斤斤计较个人利害，怕被打成“反革命”，怕被“开除党籍”，怕遭陷害等等。数不尽的忧虑，把我的革命劲头压下去了。这些“私”字不破除，一心为公的世界观不树立，就不可能很好地理解和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线；这些私心杂念不斗倒，就无法放下包袱，轻装上阵。在无产阶级革命派同志的耐心帮助下，我反复学习“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字和“怕”字，树立“公”字和“敢”字。从今年一月开始，我积极参加批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争，揭发和控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行。不久，我被吸收加入了革命群众组织，最近又被选为车间革命群众组织的委员。我认识到，我们受过资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部，只有破私立公，从无产阶级的利益出发，去认识两条路线的斗争，才能够下定同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底的决心，才能在斗争中冲锋陷阵，勇往直前。
    彻底打碎《修养》的精神枷锁
    内燃机厂革命委员会委员、前厂长王峻说：在文化大革命的初期，我因为中了《修养》的毒，在所谓“内外有别”和“组织性”的束缚下，充当了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的“驯服工具”，不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线。我体会到，受蒙蔽的干部要放下包袱，轻装上阵，就必须彻底打碎《修养》这个反革命修正主义的精神枷锁，真正按照毛主席的教导去做：“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”
    文化大革命开始不久，原青岛市委工交政治部派驻我厂的工作组，就祭起了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的法宝。在不到两个月的时间里，全厂有百分之三十的革命干部受到围攻。我当时想：毛主席亲手制定的“二十三条”中清楚地指出，好的和比较好的干部是多数。我们厂刚搞过四清，为什么工作组把我们厂的干部队伍看得一团黑？我想不通，就去找工作组，说了自己的看法。但是，却被工作组严厉地顶了回来。
    我碰了钉子，心里直翻腾。心想：都怪我多事，爱提意见。过去就是吃了这方面的亏，现在还得好好
  “修养修养”。于是，我白天参加运动，夜里就专心致志地读《修养》。我想：“工作组是上级党委派来的，还能犯错误吗？再说，就是真的错了，我是共产党员，也应该在组织上服从！”我抱着宁肯在政治路线上犯错误，不在组织路线上犯错误的态度，每句话，每个行动，每项决策，都以工作组的意志和脸色为转移。
    去年十二月，我们厂的无产阶级革命派揭竿而起。在革命洪流的冲击下，我放下了《修养》，学习了毛主席的光辉著作《学习和时局》。毛主席说：“凡事应该用脑筋好好想一想。”毛主席在《整顿党的作风》一文中还说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，……绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”我越读越觉得不能再上《修养》的当了。
    在革命群众热情帮助下，我清算了《修养》对我的毒害，打破了束缚我站起来革命的精神枷锁，检查了前段因受蒙蔽而犯的错误，决心同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。革命群众并不因我受蒙蔽而歧视我。相反，他们热情帮助我。今年二月无产阶级革命派吸收我加入了革命组织，并选我担任了厂革命委员会的委员。
    在革命的大批判中改造自己
    在文化大革命中，执行过资产阶级反动路线的前铸造车间党支部书记万炳南说：由于我的世界观没有得到很好改造，前段文化大革命中，充当了资产阶级反动路线的工具。在工作组被革命群众赶出厂之后，又多次参加过工作组主持召开的“黑会”，密谋如何对付革命群众，犯了严重的错误。
    去年年底，随着革命的深入发展，革命群众把厂里“地下工作组”的盖子揭开了。后来，又通过给革命群众平反，我开始认识到自己在工作组的操纵下，捏造事实，捕风捉影，陷害革命同志的罪行，开始认识到自己前段执行了一条资产阶级反动路线，想彻底交代，重新站起来革命。但是，我们厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派吓唬我说：“你还想站起来？听说革命派准备整你，他们罢官的名单里也有你！”这一来，我有点怕了。心想：文化革命开始以来，工作组推行资产阶级反动路线，样样事都和我有牵连。工作组幕后指挥，我在幕前执行。如果革命派按罪论处，还能轻饶我吗？可是，我又想，如果我不把这些包袱放下来，不敢和革命群众站在一起，那就正中了阶级敌人的诡计。毛主席说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”毛主席的教导给我指出了方向，给了我极大的鼓舞和力量。无产阶级革命派同志也针对我的活思想，及时地帮助我。他们从团结的愿望出发，召开了三次大会，揭发和批判我执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。并且热情地指出，我不仅是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，同时也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，鼓励我下决心同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底决裂。通过几次揭发批判，我认识到错误是自己犯的，但是根子还在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他所制定的资产阶级反动路线。革命群众批判我，并不是跟我有什么过不去，而是为了把资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭。想开了这一点，包袱放下了，精神也感到轻松了。我向革命群众作了四次检查交代，同时也揭发和控诉了资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。
    现在我深深地体会到，只有同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，同革命群众一起，把资产阶级反动路线批深批透，自己的错误才能改正得迅速，彻底。在这次革命的大批判运动中，我决心继续遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“放下包袱，开动机器”，同革命群众站在一起，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他提出的资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，使自己得到彻底的改造。
