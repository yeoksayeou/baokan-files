The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has struck fear into the hearts of all the ghosts and monsters in the world, leaving them desperate and terrified. They always try to grasp at any straw within reach to salvage their doomed fate. Now, they have pinned their hopes on the traitors of the Chinese proletariat.

Thus, the notorious Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* shouts hysterically, urging the "healthy forces" in China to "reorient the Chinese revolution back to the path of Marxism-Leninism." They delude themselves and others by claiming that these "healthy forces" are "becoming active." The *Komsomolskaya Pravda* also fantasizes that the Communist Party of China can "find the strength within itself to change this situation."

The logic of traitors is always twisted. What are these so-called "healthy forces"? They are a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party, a bunch of capitalists in power, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society. This handful of people are the enemies of the Chinese people, the dregs and scum of society.

Mr. Lu Xun once said: "Imperialism and us, apart from their lackeys, in what way are they not diametrically opposed to us? Our abscesses are their treasures."

The matter is exactly like this. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists swept out by the iron broom of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on Chinese soil, a gang of scum despised by the revolutionary people of China, have become the darlings of the Soviet revisionists, objects of their thousandfold affection and sympathy. Those who, in the difficult years of revolution, wrote "anti-communist declarations" and surrendered to the Kuomintang, betraying the cause of the proletarian revolution, those who, like Khrushchev, shamelessly praised the exploiting classes and said, "the more they exploit, the greater their merit, and the more glorious they are," are cursed by the proletariat as shameless and reactionary, but the Soviet revisionists consider these things to be "healthy forces." Such is the philosophy of traitors!

The Soviet revisionist leadership encourages these "healthy forces" to "become active," which means inciting this handful of already overthrown or being overthrown Khrushchev-like figures in China and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to launch a counterattack against the proletariat, to seize back their lost "paradise," and to "change" the situation of proletarian dictatorship in China. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like recently expressed their "sympathy" for those in China who oppose proletarian dictatorship and seek to restore capitalism. The Soviet revisionist leaders have come out to openly support the counter-revolutionary revisionists in our country, which clearly shows how brazen the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-communist and anti-China activities have become.

In fact, the Soviet revisionists are exposing their own counter-revolutionary faces. Several years ago, their predecessor Khrushchev did not support the anti-party clique in our country? Now, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China enters a new stage, the Soviet leaders have jumped out again to cheer and applaud the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party in our country and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, expressing "sympathy." The Soviet revisionist leadership and the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China are of the same ilk. The Khrushchev-like figures in the Soviet Union and the Khrushchev-like figures in China are only different in nationality; the reactionary class essence they represent is the same. It is only natural that they sympathize with each other.

The Soviet revisionist leadership even shamelessly claims to want to "guide the Chinese revolution back to the path of Marxism-Leninism." You traitors really do not know your place! What right do you have to talk about the path of Marxism-Leninism?

Chairman Mao said: "Only those without shame can say shameless things. What right do the diehards have to stand in front of us and make a sound?" The Soviet revisionist clique has long betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed the great October Revolution, and betrayed the proletariat of the Soviet Union and the world. You have completely sold your souls and betrayed the international communist movement. The proletariat of the world is cursing you traitors who have sold out to imperialism. Now you are talking about guiding the Chinese revolution back to the path of Marxism-Leninism. You really do not know what shame is!

All reactionaries are idealists. They always misjudge the situation time and time again. The Soviet revisionist leadership's myth about the "healthy forces" in China "becoming active" is still fresh in our ears, but the main backer of the counter-revolutionary revisionist "forces" in China, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, has already been dragged out into the broad daylight by the revolutionary masses! The Chinese Khrushchev, along with his revisionist trash *On the Cultivation of the Self*, is being criticized and denounced by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Now, what can Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like say?! The "healthy forces" in China that the Soviet revisionists have pinned their hopes on are not only not "becoming active" but have already collapsed and are in dire straits. The Soviet revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in socialist China has completely failed. Reality has given this bunch of fools a resounding slap in the face.

History is a mirror. In the spring of 1919, did not the imperialists of Britain, America, France, Japan, and others pin their hopes on the counter-revolutionary White Russian forces of Kolchak, Denikin, and others, attempting to use these "healthy forces" to overthrow the young Soviet Republic? But they failed. In August 1949, when Stuart was packing his bags and rolling back to Washington, did not Acheson think that one should "encourage" the "democratic individualists" in China, hoping that these "democratic individualists" would eventually show their mettle? But they also failed. Now, the anti-China clowns in the Kremlin are picking up the broken weapons used by imperialists to oppose Lenin and using the clumsy tricks of imperialism that the Chinese people have long since seen through to oppose us. The repetition of this historical phenomenon has more clearly exposed the extreme political degeneration of the Soviet revisionists.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing with the momentum of a thunderous avalanche. The Soviet revisionists pinning their hopes on a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party in China will inevitably meet the same fate as Wilson, Churchill, and Acheson, suffering a bloody defeat in front of the revolutionary people!

    可笑不自量
    上海复旦大学红卫兵新复旦师红五团红色哨兵
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，吓破了世界上一切牛鬼蛇神的胆，使他们感到绝望和恐惧。他们总想从身边抓住一根稻草，来挽救自己失败的命运。现在，他们又把自己的妄想寄托在中国无产阶级的叛徒身上。
    于是，臭名昭彰的苏联《消息报》声嘶力竭地叫嚷，要中国的“健康力量”
  “重新把中国革命引向马克思列宁主义的道路”，而且自欺欺人地胡说这种“健康力量”“正在活跃起来”。《共青团真理报》也想入非非地声称中国共产党能够“在自己内部找到力量来改变这种状况”。
    叛徒的逻辑总是颠倒的。他们的所谓“健康力量”是什么东西呢？就是中国党内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子、走资本主义道路的当权派，以及社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子。这一小撮人是中国人民的敌人，社会的渣滓和败类。
    鲁迅先生说过：“帝国主义和我们，除了它的奴才之外，那一样利害不和我们正相反？我们的痈疽，是它们的宝贝。”
    事情正是这样。中国国土上的被无产阶级文化大革命的铁扫帚扫出来的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一伙为中国革命人民所不齿的败类，成了苏修叛徒眼中千般爱怜、万般同情的“宝贝”。对于那些在革命艰难的岁月里写“反共启事”自首变节，公开投降国民党，背叛无产阶级革命事业的叛徒，对于那些大肆吹捧剥削阶级，胡说“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣”的赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家，无产阶级骂之为无耻，斥之为反动，而苏修叛徒却认为这些东西是“健康力量”。叛徒的哲学就是如此！
    苏修领导集团鼓励这些“健康力量”“活跃起来”，就是鼓动这一小撮已被打倒或正在被打倒的中国的赫鲁晓夫式的人物和地、富、反、坏、右分子，向无产阶级进行反攻倒算，重新夺回他们失去了的“天堂”，“改变”中国无产阶级专政的“状况”。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流不久前直截了当地表示“同情”中国国内反对无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的人。苏修头目跳出来公开支持我国的反革命修正主义分子，这不正是表明苏修领导集团的反共反华活动，已经到了何等猖狂的地步。
    事实上，苏修叛徒们正在自己揭露自己的反革命面目。好几年前，他们的前辈赫鲁晓夫不是支持过我国的反党集团吗？如今在中国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新阶段时，苏修的头目们又跳出来对我国党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子以及地、富、反、坏、右分子喝采叫好，表示“同情”。苏修领导集团同中国的反革命修正主义分子本是一路货。苏联赫鲁晓夫式的人物和中国赫鲁晓夫式的人物，只是国籍不同，他们所代表的反动阶级本质，则是一致的。他们之间互相“同情”，当然是丝毫也不奇怪的。
    苏修领导集团居然还恬不知耻地表示要“把中国革命引向马克思列宁主义的道路”。你们这些叛徒也实在太不自量了，你们有什么资格来谈论马克思列宁主义的道路呢？
    毛主席说：“只有不要脸的人们才说得出不要脸的话，顽固派有什么资格站在我们面前哼一声呢？”苏修集团早就背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了伟大十月革命的道路，背叛了苏联和全世界的无产阶级。你们彻底出卖了自己的灵魂，彻底背叛了国际共产主义运动。全世界无产阶级都在痛骂你们这些卖身投靠帝国主义的叛徒。你们如今却谈论什么要“把中国革命引向马克思列宁主义的道路”。简直不知人间有什么羞耻事！
    一切反动派都是唯心主义者。他们总是一次又一次地错误估计形势。苏修领导集团关于中国“健康力量”“正在活跃起来”的神话犹在耳边，中国反革命修正主义“力量”的总后台、中国党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，已经被广大革命群众揪到光天化日之下了！中国的赫鲁晓夫连同他的修正主义货色黑《修养》，正在受到亿万革命群众的批判和声讨。现在，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流还有什么话可说呢？！苏修头目们寄予希望的中国的“健康力量”，非但没有“正在活跃起来”，而且已经土崩瓦解，陷入绝境。苏修期望社会主义的中国复辟资本主义的梦想已经彻底破产了。现实给了这伙蠢人一记响亮的耳光。
    历史是一面镜子。一九一九年春天开始，英、美、法、日等帝国主义不是把希望寄托在高尔察克、邓尼金等反革命白俄分子身上，企图利用这些“健康力量”颠覆年轻的苏维埃共和国吗？但是，他们失败了。一九四九年八月，当司徒雷登挟起皮包滚回华盛顿的时候，艾奇逊不是认为“应当”“鼓励”中国的“民主个人主义者”，期待这些“民主个人主义终于会再显身手”吗？但是，他们也失败了。现在，克里姆林宫里的反华小丑们又拣起帝国主义者反对列宁时所使用过的破烂武器，使用中国人民早已领教过的帝国主义的拙劣伎俩来反对我们，这种历史现象的重复，却把苏修叛徒在政治上的极端堕落更清楚地暴露出来了。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命正以雷霆万钧之势滚滚向前。苏修一伙把希望寄托在中国党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子身上，必然会和当年的威尔逊、丘吉尔、艾奇逊一样，在革命人民面前碰得头破血流！
