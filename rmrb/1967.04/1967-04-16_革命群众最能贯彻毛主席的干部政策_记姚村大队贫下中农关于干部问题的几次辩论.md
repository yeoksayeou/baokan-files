The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out vigorously in Yaocun Production Brigade, Wencheng County, Shanxi Province. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and reactionary elements such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, seeing that their end is near, are struggling desperately and stirring up trouble, trying to muddy the waters and slip away. They spread reactionary slogans such as “All cadres, big and small, in one pot,” “All cadres stand aside,” and “Everyone should be struggled against.” Under these circumstances, some cadres are anxious, and some have laid down their work, fearing that production will be affected.

However, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses have smashed the plots of the class enemies.

How should we correctly handle the cadres? The brigade Cultural Revolution Committee organized the masses to repeatedly study the “Sixteen Points” personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the “Draft Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Rural Areas,” the “Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People’s Communes Throughout the Country,” and relevant passages on cadres in the “Quotations from Chairman Mao.” Chairman Mao said: “Our comrades are absolutely mostly good comrades. For those who have made mistakes, once criticism is launched and errors are exposed, they can be corrected.” During the discussion, some said: “The ‘Sixteen Points’ point out that the focus of this movement is to criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Does that mean all our brigade’s cadres are capitalist-roaders in power?” Others said: “No. The letter from the Party Central Committee clearly states that the majority of cadres at all levels of the commune are good or relatively good. The ‘Ten Points on Rural Cultural Revolution’ also clearly point out that the focus is to criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. We should distinguish between the ‘majority’ and the ‘handful.’ Chairman Mao’s words are the guiding light and the key to solving problems.” Everyone felt enlightened after studying. They then used the method of class analysis to specifically analyze the cadres in their own brigade. Everyone thought that the majority of the cadres in Yaocun Production Brigade come from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds and have been tested in the “Four Cleanups.” Most of them are good. We should strictly follow Chairman Mao’s instructions, direct the struggle at the “handful,” and unite and win over the “majority.” The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses said: We absolutely cannot “cook all good and bad cadres in one pot” and fall into the enemy’s trap.

Who exactly are the capitalist-roaders in power, and who are not? The Cultural Revolution Committee handed over all the cadres to the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses for identification. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses all felt that the cadre issue is of great importance and cannot be handled carelessly. But how to distinguish between proletarian cadres in power and capitalist-roaders in power? Another heated debate ensued. Some said: “Whoever has more big-character posters is a capitalist-roader in power.” Others said: “Some cadres get angry and scold the members whenever they speak, which is the style of the Kuomintang. I think he is a capitalist-roader in power.” Still, others said: “Whose face is not written with good or bad, who can tell which faction he belongs to!” Various opinions clashed, and understanding was not unified. What to do? They still sought answers from Chairman Mao’s works. Chairman Mao said: “Draw a clear line between two kinds of people. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it Yan’an or Xi’an?” He also said: “The policy of the Communist Party towards its cadres should be to judge them by whether they can firmly carry out the Party’s line, obey Party discipline, and have close ties with the masses, have independent working ability, are active and hardworking, and do not seek personal gain…” Everyone agreed that when looking at cadres, one must distinguish between “major issues” and “minor issues,” and see what flag they raise and what path they follow. Everyone, based on Chairman Mao’s teachings, continued the discussion. Some members said: “XXX has a harsh attitude and simple work methods. How many members have no complaints about him? Can he still be considered a good cadre?” The majority disagreed with this view. The reason is: although he has the shortcomings of a harsh attitude and simple work methods, he comes from a poor background, has been a long-term laborer, has been the chairman of the farmers’ association, has been the secretary of the branch, and has been a cadre for decades, always listening to Chairman Mao’s words, able to uphold Party principles, with a firm footing and a correct path, and is still a good cadre. As for another cadre, although he speaks “politely” and seems to have no airs, most of the masses think he has no feelings for Chairman Mao, no feelings for socialism, does not cherish the collective, and is not a good cadre.

After repeated debates and careful analysis, the issues within the cadre ranks were clarified, and it was believed that the majority of cadres, although they have different degrees of shortcomings and errors, are still cadres who can be united with, educated, and trusted.

Through serious study of Chairman Mao’s relevant instructions and teachings on cadres and conducting class analysis of cadres, the broad revolutionary masses have gained a correct understanding of cadres. However, uniting with cadres is not to first ask revolutionary masses to stand on the side of cadres, but to ask revolutionary cadres to first stand on the side of revolutionary masses. Most cadres, after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao’s policies on cadres and central documents, have stood on the side of the masses. However, there are still a few cadres who have made general mistakes and cannot stand up to revolution. Should we lock them out, or should we unprincipledly drag them over, or should we, through a rigorous struggle of thought, win them over and unite with them?

The broad revolutionary masses of Yaocun Production Brigade seriously followed Chairman Mao’s teachings and opposed the first two methods, firmly adhering to the principle of “punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient.” They actively and patiently helped these cadres. They carefully analyzed the reasons why these cadres could not stand up and did meticulous and painstaking ideological and political work. They helped these cadres study Chairman Mao’s instructions: “You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better.” They encouraged cadres to “show their faces” to the masses. In this way, the cadres who made mistakes quickly awakened, actively stood on the side of the revolutionary masses, and quickly gained the trust and support of the masses. The head of the water conservancy section initially could not accept the criticisms from the masses, was full of complaints, and worked passively, resulting in increasing opposition with the masses. After patient education and help, he stood up to revolution, actively went to the masses to make self-criticisms. He said painfully: “Chairman Mao teaches us, ‘Everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups.’ I am a poor peasant, have been a long-term laborer for more than ten years, and have turned over a new leaf thanks to Chairman Mao. I have not listened to Chairman Mao’s words well, and I will firmly correct my mistakes.” After the self-criticism, the masses saw that his attitude was sincere and that he could correct his mistakes, and they all said: “He is still our good cadre.”

Correctly implementing Chairman Mao’s policies on cadres, uniting with the majority of cadres, has gone through a tortuous path and complex struggles and has achieved great victories. The broad revolutionary masses earnestly told the cadres: “As long as you listen to Chairman Mao’s words, stand up straight, and do revolution well, you are good cadres, and we welcome, unite with, and support you!” The cadres also made a vow to Chairman Mao, to the Party, and to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses: “We will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee’s expectations, always listen to Chairman Mao’s words, always stand with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, and serve the people for life.”

    革命群众最能贯彻毛主席的干部政策
    ——记姚村大队贫下中农关于干部问题的几次辩论
    山新
    无产阶级文化大革命在山西闻喜县姚村大队轰轰烈烈地开展起来以后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，看到他们的末日到了，便垂死挣扎，兴风作浪，企图把水搅混，趁机溜走。他们散布“大小干部一锅煮”，“干部一律靠边站”，“人人要上斗争会”等反动言论。在这种情况下，部分干部人心惶惶，有的躺倒不干，眼看生产要受到影响。
    但是，在毛泽东思想的指引下，广大群众粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
    如何正确对待干部呢？大队文革委员会组织群众反复学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”、《中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）》、《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和《毛主席语录》中有关干部问题的论述。毛主席说：“我们的同志，绝对大多数都是好同志。对于有了毛病的人，一经展开批评，揭发错误，也就可以改正。”在讨论中，有的说：“十六条”指出，这次运动的重点，是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。难道咱队的干部就都是走资本主义道路的当权派？有的说：不会。党中央给咱的信里讲得明白，公社各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。农村文化大革命“十条”也明确指出，重点是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子嘛！我们应当分清“绝大多数”和“一小撮”。毛主席的话是指路明灯，是解决问题的金钥匙。大家一学习，心里亮堂了。他们又用阶级分析的方法，具体地分析了一下本队的干部。大家认为，姚村大队的干部，大部分出身贫下中农，是在“四清”中受过考验的，大部分都是好的。应当不折不扣地照毛主席的指示办事，把斗争的矛头对准“一小撮”，团结争取“绝大多数”。广大贫下中农、革命群众说：我们绝不能“好坏干部一锅煮”，上了敌人的当。
    到底谁个是走资本主义道路的当权派，谁个不是？文革委员会把所有干部交给贫下中农和革命群众去鉴别。广大贫下中农和革命群众都觉得，干部问题事关重大，决不能马马虎虎。可是，怎样区分谁是无产阶级的当权派，谁是走资本主义道路的当权派呢？又是一场热烈的争论。有的说：“谁大字报多，谁就是走资本主义道路的当权派。”有的说：“有的干部一说话就吹胡子瞪眼睛，动不动就批评社员，这是国民党作风，我看他就象走资本主义道路的当权派。”还有的说：“哪个干部好坏，脸上又没刻字，谁能分清他是哪一派！”各种意见争执不下，认识不统一。怎么办？他们还是从毛主席著作中找答案。毛主席说：“划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”又说：“共产党的干部政策，应是以能否坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准……。”大家一致认为，看待干部，一定要分清“大节”和
    “小节”，看他打的什么旗，走的什么路。大家根据毛主席的教导，又展开讨论。有的社员说：“×××态度生硬，工作方法简单，社员有几个对他没意见？这还能算好干部？”大多数人不同意这种看法。理由是：他虽然有态度生硬、工作方法简单的缺点，但他出身贫苦，扛过长工，当过农会主席，任过支部书记，当干部几十年，一贯听毛主席的话，能坚持党的原则，脚跟站得稳，路子走得正，还是个好干部。说到另一个干部，虽然平时说话“和气”，看上去没有什么架子，但大部分群众认为他对毛主席没感情，对社会主义没感情，不爱护集体，不是个好干部。
    经过反复争论，仔细分析，澄清了干部队伍中的问题，认为绝大多数干部虽然有不同程度的缺点错误，但是可以团结、教育和信赖的。
    经过认真学习毛主席有关干部问题的论述和指示，对干部进行了阶级分析，使广大革命群众对干部有了正确的认识。但是，团结干部，不是首先要求革命群众站在干部一边，而必须是革命干部首先站到革命群众一边来。大多数干部经过反复学习毛主席的干部政策和中央文件，站到群众一边来了。可是，还有少数犯有一般错误的干部，仍然不能站起来革命。是把他们关在门外，还是把他们无原则地硬拉过来？或者经过严格的思想斗争把他们争取团结过来？
    姚村大队的广大革命群众认真按照毛主席的教导去做，他们反对前两种作法，坚决按照“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，对这些干部进行了积极的耐心的帮助。他们仔细分析了这些干部站不起来的原因，进行了针对性的艰苦细致的思想政治工作。他们帮助这些干部学习毛主席的指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”鼓励干部到群众中去“亮相”。这样，使犯错误的干部很快觉悟过来了，积极往革命群众方面站，很快得到了群众的信赖和支持。水利股长起初对群众批评听不进去，满腹牢骚，工作消极，结果和群众越来越对立。经过耐心的教育帮助，他站出来革命了，主动到群众中去检讨。他痛心地说：“毛主席教导我们，‘一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发’。我是贫农，扛过十几年长工，是靠毛主席翻的身，我没有好好听毛主席的话，我要坚决改正自己的错误。”检查之后，群众看他态度诚恳，能知错改错，都说：“他还是我们的好干部。”
    正确贯彻毛主席的干部政策，团结干部大多数，经历了曲折的道路和复杂的斗争，取得了很大胜利。广大革命群众语重心长地对干部们说：“你们只要听毛主席的话，挺起腰杆好好干革命，就是好干部，我们就欢迎，就团结，就支持！”干部们也向毛主席、向党、向广大贫下中农和革命群众发出誓言：“我们一定不辜负毛主席和党中央的希望，永远听毛主席的话，永远和广大贫下中农、革命群众站在一起，为人民服务一辈子。”
