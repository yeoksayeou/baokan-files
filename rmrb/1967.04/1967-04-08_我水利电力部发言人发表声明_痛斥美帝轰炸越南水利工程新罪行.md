The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power today issued a statement strongly condemning the new war crime committed by U.S. imperialism in its indiscriminate bombing of water projects in residential areas of North Vietnam. The statement firmly supports the principled stance of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and resolutely supports the Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the anti-U.S., aid-nation war to the end.

The statement says: The Vietnamese people are a heroic people, a people who fear no tyranny, dare to fight, and dare to win. No matter what tricks the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices play, whether it be "escalation," "negotiations," or any other, they cannot deceive the Vietnamese people. On the contrary, they only expose their paper tiger nature. In fact, the recent brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in the south and the north have already given a resounding reply to the U.S. imperialists' war blackmail. We are confident that the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.
