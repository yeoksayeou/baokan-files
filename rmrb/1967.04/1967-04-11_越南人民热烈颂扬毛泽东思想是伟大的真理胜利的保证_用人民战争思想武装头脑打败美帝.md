In the struggle against American imperialism, the heroic Vietnamese people have established brilliant achievements. They deeply respect and love the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and warmly praise Mao Zedong Thought as the great truth and guarantee of victory.

Many Vietnamese comrades, upon receiving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," repeatedly said, "This is a treasure of the revolution" and "a guarantee of victory." Many Vietnamese comrades have persistently studied the works of Chairman Mao and actively applied them in the current struggle against American imperialism. Some dedicate two evenings a week to study. One Vietnamese comrade received a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," although he did not understand Chinese, he asked a comrade who did to translate it into Vietnamese, studying it section by section. A military officer of the Vietnamese People's Army said, "Our several years of struggle against American imperialism have proven that Chairman Mao's teachings are the truth, and American imperialism is a paper tiger." A self-defense militia member and a cadre from the South, Comrade Triet, said, "We must firmly hold our guns, study Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, and resolve to fight to the end, ensuring the final victory of the struggle against American imperialism." A soldier from a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Vietnamese People's Army, which has fought extensively in North Vietnam and achieved great victories, said, "The struggle of the Vietnamese people has proven that Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is completely correct." "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world." A worker from the South, Comrade Su, excitedly told a Chinese comrade, "The struggle of our people in the South has proven that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, and take up arms to fight the enemy, the final victory will be ours."

Many heroes from Hon Gai Island, ferry workers, brave young shock troops, and comrades from various fronts, when meeting Chinese comrades, repeatedly requested to convey their greetings to the great leader, beloved Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life. When they saw photographs of Chairman Mao inspecting the Red Guards at Tiananmen Gate and swimming in the Yangtze River last year, everyone was beaming with smiles, feeling immense happiness. A female militia member from a certain factory, Comrade Hai, was extremely excited and joyful, saying, "The brilliant victories led by Chairman Mao for the Chinese people are also our victories. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life." A cadre from Ha Tay Province, upon receiving a photograph of Chairman Mao inspecting the Red Guards at Tiananmen Gate from a Chinese comrade, could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Many Vietnamese comrades, to express their love for Chairman Mao, eagerly hoped to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. Many comrades felt honored to wear a Chairman Mao badge on their chests. A cultural worker from Haiphong Province, upon receiving a Chairman Mao badge from a Chinese comrade, held the comrade's hand for a long time, repeatedly saying, "This is the most precious gift. I will keep the Chairman Mao badge forever." A bulldozer operator, upon receiving the Chairman Mao badge, stood at attention and saluted like a soldier receiving a medal. On a certain water conservancy construction site, after receiving the Chairman Mao badges, the workers were extremely happy. A worker told a Chinese comrade, "The Chairman Mao badge is worn on the chest, and Mao Zedong Thought is imprinted in the heart."

The heroic Vietnamese people, in their struggle against American imperialism, are striving to study Mao Zedong Thought, further clarifying the reactionary nature of American imperialism, and are full of confidence in the victory of the struggle against American imperialism. A worker, Comrade Ho, said, "The people's war thought of Chairman Mao has armed us, making us firmly believe that American imperialism will be defeated and the Vietnamese people will be victorious. As long as we remain vigilant and fight bravely, we can thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and modern revisionists." On some artillery positions, it can be seen that the soldiers are seizing every opportunity during battles to practice shooting using model airplanes made from scrap iron, ready to confront any invading American air pirates at any time. A Vietnamese comrade said, "We remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' Now, American imperialism is shouting 'peace talks,' we must be vigilant and not be fooled. We do not harbor any illusions about the enemy and are ready to deal with the enemy's new 'escalation' of war at any time."

A worker from a certain factory in Hanoi, Comrade Van, said, "Chairman Mao pointed out, 'The oppressed peoples and nations cannot rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in the struggle.' The struggles of the Vietnamese people over the years have proven this to be completely correct. American imperialism talks about 'peace,' but in reality, it intensifies the war. We will not be deceived. Only by fighting hard and fighting to the end can we achieve the final victory."

    越南人民热烈颂扬毛泽东思想是伟大的真理胜利的保证
    用人民战争思想武装头脑打败美帝
    新华社河内十日电　本社记者报道：在抗美救国斗争中建立辉煌功勋的英雄的越南人民，无限敬仰和热爱全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，热烈颂扬毛泽东思想是伟大的真理，胜利的保证。
    许多越南同志在得到红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和《毛泽东选集》时连声说：“这是革命的宝书”“胜利的保证”。不少越南同志一直坚持学习毛主席著作，并且结合当前的抗美救国斗争，活学活用。有的每周用两个晚上的时间学习。有一位越南同志得到了一本《毛主席语录》，虽然他不懂中文，但他请了一位懂中文的同志替他翻成越文，一段一段地学。越南人民军的一位军官说：“我们这几年同美帝国主义进行斗争的实践证明，毛主席的学说是真理，美帝国主义就是一只纸老虎。”某工厂民兵自卫队员、南方集结干部哲同志说：“我们要紧握手中枪，在斗争中学习毛泽东思想，树立战斗到底的决心，使抗美救国斗争取得最后胜利。”两年多来曾经转战越南北方、立下巨大战功的“决胜单位”、越南人民军某高炮部队的一位战士说：“越南人民的斗争证明，毛主席提出的帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断是完全正确的。”“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的伟大领袖。”一位越南南方集结工人苏同志激动地对中国同志说：“我们南方人民的斗争实践证明，只要按照毛主席提出的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想，拿起武器同敌人战斗，最后胜利就是属于我们的。”
    许多来自昏果岛的英雄战士、渡口的工兵、勇敢的青年突击队员以及各条战线上的越南同志，见到中国同志时都一再要求转达他们对伟大领袖——敬爱的毛主席的问候，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。当他们看到毛主席去年在天安门城楼检阅红卫兵和在长江游泳的照片时，个个笑容满面，感到无限幸福。某工厂一位女民兵海姐非常激动和兴奋地说：“毛主席领导中国人民取得的辉煌胜利，也是我们越南人民的胜利。我衷心地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。”广平省一位干部在接受中国同志赠送的毛主席在天安门城楼检阅红卫兵的照片时，情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    许多越南同志为表达对毛主席的热爱，都热切地希望得到一枚毛主席像章，许多同志都为自己胸前戴上毛主席像章而感到光荣。和平省一位文化工作者接受一位中国同志赠送的毛主席像章时，久久地握住这位中国同志的手，连声说：“这是最宝贵的礼物，我要永远保存好毛主席像章。”一位推土机工人在接受毛主席像章时，象战士接受勋章一样，立正行军礼。在某水利工地上，工人们得到毛主席像章后，无限高兴。一位工人对中国同志说：“毛主席像章挂在胸前，毛泽东思想印在心上”。
    英雄的越南人民在同美帝国主义的斗争中，努力学习毛泽东思想，进一步认清了美帝国主义的反动本质，对抗美救国斗争的胜利充满信心。一位工人何同志说：“毛主席的人民战争思想武装了我们，使我们坚信美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜。只要我们保持警惕，英勇战斗，就能够彻底打败美国侵略强盗和现代修正主义。”在一些炮兵阵地上可以看到，战士们都抓紧战斗的空隙，利用废铁制成的飞机模型，加紧进行射击练习，随时准备迎击来犯的美国空中强盗。一位越南同志说：“我们记住毛主席的教导：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’现在美帝国主义叫喊‘和谈’，我们必须提高警惕，不能上当。我们对敌人不抱幻想，随时准备对付敌人新的战争‘升级’。”
    河内市某工厂工人文同志说：“毛主席指出，‘被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。’我们越南人民多年来的斗争证明这是完全正确的。美帝国主义口谈‘和平’，实际上加紧战争，我们绝不上当。只有狠狠地打，打到底，我们就一定能够取得最后胜利。”
