The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party issued a statement on March 31, protesting the relocation of the NATO military headquarters, which was expelled from France, to Belgium.

The statement said: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is one of the tools of U.S. imperialism's global policy aimed at world domination." The statement pointed out that moving the NATO military headquarters and the council of this organization to Belgium "is an important step for the United States to strengthen its rule over our country, and it is a military reinforcement of the economic neocolonialism that the United States is implementing."

The statement pointed out that the big financial capitalists in Belgium, the parties representing the interests of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, and their successive governments, as well as the Belgian revisionist group that advocates U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, are directly responsible for the situation where Belgium has become a puppet state of U.S. imperialism. "It is they who have made Belgium further subordinate to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, finally handing over our territory to the institutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that were expelled by France."

The statement further pointed out: "In short, they are pursuing a policy of betrayal, and they are acting as the docile accomplices of the new occupying forces—the heirs of Hitler's imperialism."

The statement said: "This new occupation has already sparked new resistance across the country. The victories achieved in the struggle against American Nazi colonialists show that the Belgian people's determination to restore national independence is growing stronger."

The NATO military headquarters, expelled from France—the so-called Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe—officially opened on March 31 in Casteau-Maizeret near Mons, Belgium. On that day, local youth held a march and demonstration, expressing their resolute opposition to the establishment of the headquarters of this U.S.-controlled military bloc in Belgium and their resolute opposition to the U.S. imperialism's occupation of Belgium through NATO.

Despite the deployment of thousands of police to suppress the protests, demonstrators, with the enthusiastic and strong support of all the working people in Casteau-Maizeret, distributed a large number of leaflets, and many people also gave speeches.

In Brussels, people wrote large slogans such as "Yankee go home" on many military vehicles of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and drew swastikas.

    比共声明抗议北大西洋集团军总部搬到比利时
    比利时人民坚决反对美帝新占领
    新华社布鲁塞尔一日电　比利时共产党中央委员会三月三十一日发表声明，抗议被赶出法国的北大西洋集团军队总司令部搬到比利时。
    声明说：“北大西洋公约组织是美帝国主义旨在称霸世界的全球政策的工具之一。”声明指出，把北大西洋集团军队总司令部和这个集团的理事会迁到比利时，“是美国加强对我国的统治的一个重要环节，是从军事上加强美国所实行的经济殖民主义化。”
    声明指出，比利时的大金融资本家、代表大地主、大资产阶级利益的政党和它们的历届政府以及鼓吹美苏合作称霸世界的比利时修正主义集团，应对使比利时沦为美帝国主义附庸国的这种状况负直接的责任。“正是它们使比利时进一步附属于北大西洋公约组织，终于把我国领土奉送给被法国驱逐出去的北大西洋公约组织的机构。”
    声明接着指出：“总之，它们推行卖国政策，它们充当了新占领军——希特勒帝国主义的继承者——的驯服的帮凶。”
    声明说：“这种新占领已经在全国各地引起新的反抗。在反对美国纳粹殖民主义者的斗争中已经取得的胜利说明，比利时人民要求恢复国家独立的决心越来越坚强。”
    新华社布鲁塞尔二日电　被法国赶走的北大西洋集团军队总司令部——所谓欧洲盟军最高司令部，三月三十一日在比利时蒙斯附近的卡斯托—梅齐埃尔正式开张。当天，这个地方的青年就举行了游行示威，表示坚决反对把美国控制的这个军事集团的总部设在比利时，坚决反对美帝国主义通过北大西洋集团对比利时进行占领。
    尽管有成千军警出动镇压，但是示威者在卡斯托—梅齐埃尔全体劳动人民热情、大力的支持下散发了大量传单，许多人还发表了演说。
    在布鲁塞尔，人们在欧洲盟军最高司令部的许多军用车辆上用油漆涂上了“美国（佬）滚回去”的大字标语，画上了希特勒的卐字标记。
