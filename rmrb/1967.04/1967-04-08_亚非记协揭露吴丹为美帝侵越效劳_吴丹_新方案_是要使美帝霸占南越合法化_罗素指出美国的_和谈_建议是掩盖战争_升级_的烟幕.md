The Asia-Africa Journalists Association Secretariat today issued a statement exposing United Nations Secretary-General U Thant's so-called "three-step plan" for solving the Vietnam problem. The statement firmly supports the stern statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pointing out that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

The statement points out that U Thant's trick of playing with the "new plan" is to serve U.S. imperialism, to openly blackmail the heroic Vietnamese people, and to help the U.S. imperialists get what they cannot obtain on the battlefield from the negotiating table, even to "legalize" their rule over South Vietnam.

The statement expresses that the Asia-Africa Journalists Association Secretariat firmly supports the stern statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 27 regarding U Thant's recent activities. This statement emphasizes: The Vietnam issue has nothing to do with the United Nations, and the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue in any way. The Asia-Africa Journalists Association Secretariat fully supports the just position of the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and firmly demands that the U.S. aggressors immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the entire Vietnam.

The statement says that the Asia-Africa Journalists Association Secretariat calls on revolutionary and fighting journalists in Asia and Africa to take immediate action, using various propaganda means to thoroughly expose the new tricks of the U.S. and Soviet collusion to use the "peace talks" smokescreen to cover up the U.S. imperialists' war expansion actions, and to mobilize the broad masses of the people in Asia and Africa to firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out their just war of opposing U.S. aggression, liberating the South, defending the North, and fighting for the reunification of the motherland to the end.

According to the New China News Agency, on April 3, the famous British philosopher Bertrand Russell published an article in the "Morning News" of East Pakistan, saying: "To demand that the Vietnamese negotiate with the Americans is to equate the victim with the aggressor."

The article says: "Every time the Americans propose so-called negotiations, they inevitably increase their troops.... This blatant deception shows that such proposals are a smokescreen to cover the escalation of the war."

The article says that Vietnam has been used by the invaders as a testing ground for chemical poisons, poison gases, and various bloody and deadly weapons. However, now some people want the Vietnamese people to accept negotiations with the invaders who have done all these evil things on the invaders' terms. This demand "encourages U.S. aggression."

    亚非记协揭露吴丹为美帝侵越效劳
    吴丹“新方案”是要使美帝霸占南越合法化
    罗素指出美国的“和谈”建议是掩盖战争“升级”的烟幕
    据新华社五日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表关于揭露联合国秘书长吴丹所谓解决越南战争问题的“三个步骤”方案的声明，坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人的严正声明，指出联合国绝对无权干涉越南问题。
    声明指出，吴丹玩弄“新方案”的花招是为美帝国主义效劳的，是对英雄的越南人民公开进行讹诈，是为了摆脱美国侵略者在越南的狼狈处境，企图帮助美帝从谈判桌上获得它在战场上得不到的东西，即使他们对越南南方的统治“合法化”。
    声明表示，亚非记协书记处坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人三月二十七日就吴丹最近的活动发表的严正声明。这一声明强调：越南问题同联合国没有关系，联合国绝对没有权利以任何方式干涉越南问题。亚非记协书记处完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明的正义立场，并坚决要求美国侵略者立即从整个越南全部无条件地滚出去。
    声明说，亚非记协书记处呼吁亚非革命的和战斗的新闻工作者立即行动起来，使用各种宣传手段，彻底揭露美苏勾结在一起用“和谈”烟幕掩盖美帝国主义扩大战争行动的新诡计，并动员广大亚非人民坚决支援英雄的越南人民把反对美国侵略、解放南方、保卫北方、争取祖国统一的正义战争进行到底。
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第五日电　著名英国哲学家伯特朗德·罗素四月三日在东巴基斯坦的《晨报》上发表文章说：“要求越南人同美国谈判就是把受害者同进攻者等同起来。”
    文章说：“美国人每次提出所谓的谈判建议，就必然随之大增兵一次。……这种明目张胆的欺骗方式说明，这种建议是掩盖战争升级的烟幕。”
    文章说，越南被侵略者用来作为化学毒剂、毒气、各种流血和死亡的试验场，但是，现在竟然有人要越南人民接受干尽了这一切坏事的侵略者按照侵略者提出的条件进行谈判，这种要求“助长了美国的侵略行动”。
