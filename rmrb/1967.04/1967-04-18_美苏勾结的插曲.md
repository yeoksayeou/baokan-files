Some official representatives of the Soviet Union recently visited the U.S. Department of the Interior, publicly applying to bid on the turbine generator project for the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State. This has become a headline news in the bourgeois newspapers of the United States.

A government that claims to be a socialist power actually behaves like a contractor, competing with U.S. monopolistic capital for business. What is the reason behind this?

Is it because the material and technological strength of the Soviet Union has already met and exceeded the needs of domestic construction? No, the opposite is true. The Soviet revisionist leadership has not only recently placed advertisements in U.S. newspapers to attract business and welcome U.S. investment, but they are also demanding that Japanese monopolistic capital develop Siberia.

Do they intend to make a profit from this bidding? Of course, for the Soviet revisionist clique that is in urgent need of foreign exchange, if they can complete this deal, it would be of some help. At the very least, they can exchange it for a batch of the latest American coats and shoes to add luster to their so-called "communism."

However, it is more accurate to say that this is a political transaction rather than a money-making deal. Hasn't the Johnson administration repeatedly expressed its desire to "build a bridge" with the Soviet Union and continually thrown out bait, easing trade restrictions on the Soviet Union? Under Johnson's "invitation," the Soviet revisionist leadership naturally responds enthusiastically, seizing every opportunity to "build a bridge" with the United States.

It is against this backdrop that the Soviet revisionist leadership personally took the initiative to publicly apply to participate in the bidding. Although this is just an episode in the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, it shows how eagerly and relentlessly the Soviet revisionist leadership pursues "U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

    美苏勾结的插曲
    苏联的一些官方代表，最近登门拜访美国内政部，公开申请要求参加对美国华盛顿州大库利水电站涡轮发电机工程的投标。这在美国的资产阶级报纸上，已经成为一个头条新闻。
      一个自称为社会主义大国的政府，竟然象一个承包商一样，去同美国的垄断资本抢生意，这到底是为什么呢？
    难道是苏联的物质和技术力量已经能够满足国内的建设需要而且绰绰有余了吗？不，事实恰恰相反。苏修领导集团最近不是还在美国报纸上刊登广告，招徕生意，欢迎美国投资吗？他们不是正在要求日本垄断资本去开发西伯利亚吗？
    难道他们想从这个投标中去捞取一笔美元吗？当然，对于急需外汇的苏修集团来说，如果能够做成这笔生意，倒也不无小补。至少可以换来一批美国时新大衣、皮鞋，为他们的所谓“共产主义”增光。
    但是，与其说这是赚钱的买卖，不如说是政治上的交易。约翰逊政府不是一再表示要同苏联
  “搭桥”，并且不断抛出诱饵，放宽对苏联的贸易限制吗？苏修领导集团在约翰逊的“感召”之下，当然要积极响应，抓住一切机会来向美国“搭桥”。
    正是在这样的背景下，苏修领导集团才亲自出马，公开出来要求参加投标。这虽然只是美苏勾结中的一个插曲，但是却向人们表明：苏修领导集团现在追求“美苏合作”，是如何地迫不及待和无孔不入啊！
