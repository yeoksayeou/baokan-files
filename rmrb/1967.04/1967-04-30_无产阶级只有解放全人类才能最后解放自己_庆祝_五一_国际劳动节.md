In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the high tide of the revolutionary criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of laboring people in our country, with boundless enthusiasm, are celebrating together with the revolutionary people of the whole world the day of solidarity and struggle of the working class and the laboring people—the May Day International Labor Day.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution now under way in our country is an unprecedented, world-shaking great revolution in the history of the international communist movement. The theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution put forward by our great leader Chairman Mao is, like Marx's creation of scientific socialism and Lenin's establishment of the first socialist state, influencing the future and destiny of the world.

Facing this great event in our country, U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their followers are all exclaiming: "This is an extraordinary and terrifying activity," "It is the most disturbing phenomenon of our time."

Our comrades and friends, however, hail it as "the greatest revolutionary movement in the history of the world communist movement," "a decisive contribution by Comrade Mao Zedong to the victory of world revolution," "It has aroused hope for the victory of communism throughout the world."

Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us to unite with all those who can be united. He has also stressed that we must implement what Marx said: only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself.

The proletariat is the most advanced class in human history and also the most deeply oppressed class. Its historical mission is not merely to seek its own liberation but to liberate all the people of the world from the oppression of the exploiting classes and from the spiritual shackles imposed by the exploiting classes for thousands of years. While transforming the objective world, the proletariat must also constantly transform its subjective world. Only in this way can the proletariat achieve its final liberation.

Understanding this, one can deeply comprehend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the standpoint of the proletarian worldview and correctly solve the problem of how to deal with the broad masses and the broad cadres, especially the problem of how to deal with the masses who have been deceived and the cadres who have made mistakes. If one only seeks to liberate oneself from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line and is satisfied with such "liberation," without wholeheartedly striving to win over, educate, and unite the cadres who have made mistakes and the masses who have been deceived, helping them to liberate themselves from the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line and from the spiritual shackles of "selfishness," then it shows that one does not have the great vision of "liberating all of humanity," and one is not a true proletarian revolutionary. Such a person will not be able to achieve his own thorough liberation.

True proletarian revolutionaries have never placed their own liberation above that of the masses but have always been "willing to be the ox that plows the field for the children," taking the liberation of the masses and the liberation of all humanity as their sole goal of struggle. To achieve this great goal, one must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, unite with all those who can be united and fight together.

Based on this principle, in dealing with cadres, proletarian revolutionaries not only dare to "strike down a handful" but also dare to "liberate a large area." They should actively and positively do political and ideological work among the cadres, creating conditions for the cadres to come out and make a revolution. For cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented to help them liberate themselves. Through the movement, the broad cadres should all stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries and on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Based on this principle, for the masses who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, they should be won over, educated, and united in the course of great criticism and great struggle. We should allow them to rise up in revolution, welcome them to rise up in revolution, and help them to rise up in revolution. Only in this way can they liberate themselves from the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, develop and strengthen the leftist forces, unite the majority of the masses, thoroughly isolate the most reactionary rightists, and achieve one victory after another.

The process of proletarian revolutionaries uniting with the majority is the process of using proletarian thought and Mao Zedong Thought to defeat bourgeois thought and revisionist thought, the process of using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to defeat the bourgeois reactionary line, the process of, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, overthrowing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and the process of constantly establishing the communist worldview of liberating all of humanity.

To unite with the majority, proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and emphasize proletarian politics. They should grasp and solve active ideological issues, strengthen political and ideological work, and achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. The army and the people should unite to accomplish the great task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution." Currently, the situation of the struggle of the revolutionary people of the whole world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries is very good. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, the revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries are dealing devastating blows to the entire old world. Imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, and all other harmful elements have already prepared their own gravediggers. The day of their thorough burial is not far off.

Proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with great Mao Zedong Thought have always regarded supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world as their sacred international duty. We must unite with all Marxist-Leninists of the world, unite with the revolutionary people of the world, and unite with all oppressed nations and peoples to overthrow imperialism led by the United States, overthrow modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, and overthrow the reactionaries of various countries. A red world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system will definitely be established.

Workers of the world, unite!

Workers of the world and oppressed peoples and nations, unite!

### 无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节

    无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己
    ——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节
    在无产阶级文化大革命的风暴里，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命大批判的高潮中，我国的无产阶级革命派和广大劳动人民，怀着无限兴奋的心情，和全世界革命人民一起，热烈庆祝工人阶级和劳动人民自己的团结战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节。
    我国正在进行着的无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动史上前所未有的、震撼世界的大革命。我们的伟大领袖毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论，如同马克思创造了科学的社会主义一样，如同列宁建立了第一个社会主义国家一样，影响着世界的前途和命运。
    面对着我国发生的这一伟大事件，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其追随者，都在惊呼：“这是异乎寻常的、令人惊恐的活动”，“是我们时代最令人不安的现象”。
    而我们的同志和朋友则欢呼它是“世界共产主义运动史上最伟大的革命运动”，“是毛泽东同志对于世界革命胜利的一个决定性的贡献”，“它在全世界激起了对共产主义胜利的希望”。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动开展以来，毛主席一再教导我们：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。他还强调，必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。
    无产阶级，是人类历史上最先进、也是受压迫最深的阶级。它的历史任务决不仅仅是求得自身的解放，而是要把全世界人民从剥削阶级的压迫下，从几千年来剥削阶级加在人们身上的精神枷锁下彻底解放出来。无产阶级在改造客观世界的同时，还要不断地改造自己的主观世界。只有这样，无产阶级自己才能得到最后的解放。
    理解了这一点，才能从无产阶级世界观的高度上，深刻地理解毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确地解决如何对待广大群众和广大干部的问题，特别是解决如何对待受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部的问题。谁如果只顾从资产阶级反动路线迫害下求得自身的解放，并且满足于这种“解放”，而不去满腔热情地争取、教育和团结犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众，使他们从资产阶级反动路线的毒害下，从“私”字的精神枷锁下解放出来，那就表明他没有“解放全人类”的伟大胸怀，他就不是一个真正的无产阶级革命者。这种人，要想求得自身的彻底解放，也是不可能的。
    真正的无产阶级革命派，从来不把自己的解放置于群众的解放之上，而是“俯首甘为孺子牛”，把群众的解放，全人类的解放，作为自己唯一的奋斗目标。为了实现这个伟大的目标，就必须按照毛主席的教导，团结一切可以团结的人们，共同战斗。
    根据这个原则，在干部问题上，无产阶级革命派不仅要勇于“打击一小撮”，而且要敢于“解放一大片”，要主动地、积极地对干部做政治思想工作，为干部站出来革命创造条件。对犯错误的干部，要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，帮助他们解放出来。要通过运动，使广大干部都站到无产阶级革命派一边，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    根据这个原则，对受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，应该在大批判大斗争中，去争取他们，教育他们，团结他们。我们应当允许他们起来革命，欢迎他们起来革命，帮助他们起来革命。只有这样，才能使他们从资产阶级反动路线的毒害下解放出来，发展和壮大左派队伍，团结最大多数的群众，彻底孤立最反动的右派，夺取一个又一个的胜利。
    无产阶级革命派团结大多数的过程，就是用无产阶级思想、毛泽东思想战胜资产阶级思想和修正主义思想的过程，就是用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的过程，就是在毛主席和党中央的领导下把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭的过程，也就是不断地树立解放全人类的共产主义世界观的过程。
    无产阶级革命派要团结大多数，就必须坚决响应毛主席提出的拥军爱民的伟大号召，认真地向解放军学习，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，大抓狠抓活思想，加强政治思想工作，在毛泽东思想的基础上，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。军民团结起来，完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大任务。
    毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。”目前，全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争形势好得很。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，越南人民的抗美救国战争，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命风暴以及各国人民的革命斗争，正在给整个旧世界以摧毁性的打击。以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，和其他一切害人虫，已经准备好了自己的掘墓人。他们被彻底埋葬的日子已经不远了。
    无产阶级国际主义，是我国对外政策的最高指导原则。由伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，一向把支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争，作为自己神圣的国际义务。我们一定要联合全世界的马克思列宁主义者，联合全世界的革命人民，联合一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，打倒以美国为首的帝国主义，打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的红彤彤的新世界，一定能建立起来。
    全世界无产者，联合起来！
    全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
