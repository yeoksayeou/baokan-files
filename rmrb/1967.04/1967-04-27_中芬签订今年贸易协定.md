The 1967 trade agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Finland was signed on April 25 in Helsinki. The agreement stipulates that the trade volume between China and Finland will further increase this year compared to last year. Additionally, through friendly consultations between the trade representatives of the two governments, it has been agreed that starting from July 1, 1967, all payments between China and Finland will be conducted through new Finnish Mark accounts opened at the banks of the two countries, thus eliminating the use of ruble settlement.
