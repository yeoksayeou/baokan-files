The Central Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party issued a statement on March 30, angrily exposing and strongly condemning the plot by the pro-American dictatorial regime of Barrientos to assassinate Oscar Zamora, the First Secretary of the Bolivian Communist Party.

Oscar Zamora was arrested without reason by the reactionary authorities in Bolivia during their mad suppression of the people in January this year. Since his arrest, he has been subjected to savage torture and persecution.

The statement of the Bolivian Communist Party points out that the pro-imperialist, anti-people government of Barrientos, in order to suppress the people's struggle, has launched a wave of persecution and arrest of workers, student leaders, and members of the Bolivian Communist Party and some mass organizations.

The statement reveals that after Oscar Zamora's arrest, he was exiled to a place where leprosy is prevalent. Now the Bolivian government is further plotting to assassinate Oscar Zamora.

The statement points out that the Barrientos reactionary regime, under the pretext of "subversive activities," has launched a "large-scale criminal activity" to cover up its selling of resources to American imperialism. This reactionary regime is currently continuing to imprison and exile a large number of Bolivian communists.

The statement calls on the Bolivian Communist Party and the Bolivian people to unite, to defend national interests and human rights, to stop the criminal activities of the reactionary government, to force the Bolivian reactionary authorities to release Oscar Zamora and other communists, and to struggle to free Bolivia from the status of an American colonial territory under the rule of Barrientos.

The pro-American dictatorial regime of Barrientos in Bolivia, after mass arrests and persecution of Bolivian communists and some union leaders, brazenly declared the Bolivian Communist Party "illegal" on April 11. This reactionary measure further provoked strong protests from Bolivian workers, some political parties, and mass organizations.

The Bolivian General Workers' Union, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement Party, the Leftist Nationalist Revolutionary Party, and the Bolivian Communist Youth League issued statements condemning the Bolivian reactionary government's use of fascist methods to persecute Bolivian revolutionaries. They pointed out that the arbitrary and dictatorial behavior of the reactionary authorities is completely unpopular.

People from all walks of life in Bolivia have risen up to oppose the fascist rule of the pro-American dictatorial government of Barrientos. Recently, all middle school students in Bolivia's legal capital, Sucre, held a general strike. In La Paz, on the 13th, more than three thousand students, despite police suppression, held a powerful demonstration.

    玻共中央强烈谴责巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权企图暗害玻共第一书记
    玻利维亚公众强烈抗议反动政府迫害革命者的法西斯暴行
    新华社十八日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党中央委员会三月三十日发表声明，愤怒揭露和强烈谴责巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权策划杀害玻利维亚共产党第一书记奥斯卡·萨莫拉的阴谋。
    奥斯卡·萨莫拉是在玻利维亚反动统治当局今年一月间疯狂镇压人民群众时被无理逮捕的。他在被捕以后，一直受到野蛮的拷打和迫害。
    玻利维亚共产党的声明指出：亲帝反人民的巴里恩托斯政府为了镇压人民的斗争，掀起了迫害和逮捕工人、大学生领导人以及玻利维亚共产党和一些群众组织成员的浪潮。
    声明揭露说，奥斯卡·萨莫拉被捕后就被流放到一个麻风病流行的地方。现在玻利维亚政府又在进一步策划一个谋杀奥斯卡·萨莫拉的阴谋。
    声明指出，巴里恩托斯反动政权借口什么“有颠覆活动”，策划了一个“大规模的罪恶活动，以此掩盖它们把资源出卖给美帝国主义的行径”。这个反动政权目前还在继续囚禁和流放大批玻利维亚共产党人。
    声明号召玻利维亚共产党人和玻利维亚人民团结起来，为保卫民族利益和人权，制止反动政府的罪恶活动，为迫使玻利维亚反动当局释放奥斯卡·萨莫拉和其他共产党人，为使玻利维亚摆脱巴里恩托斯统治下的美帝殖民地的地位而进行斗争。
    新华社十八日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权在大规模逮捕和迫害玻利维亚共产党人及一些工会领导人之后，又在四月十一日悍然宣布玻利维亚共产党为“非法”。这一反动措施进一步激起了玻利维亚工人、一些政党和群众组织的强烈抗议。
    玻利维亚总工会、民族主义革命运动党、左翼民族主义革命党和玻利维亚共产主义青年联盟等组织都发表声明，谴责玻利维亚反动政府采用这种法西斯手段来迫害玻利维亚的革命者。它们指出，反动当局的这种专横独断行为是完全不得人心的。
    玻利维亚各界人民纷纷起来反对巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政府的法西斯统治。在玻利维亚的法定首都苏克雷，最近所有的中学生举行了总罢课。在拉巴斯，十三日有三千多名学生不顾警察的武力镇压，举行了强大的示威。
