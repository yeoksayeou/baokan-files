The Political Bureau of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) has issued a statement denouncing U.S. imperialism for escalating its aggression in Vietnam and condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for encouraging and supporting U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and hostility towards China.

The statement, published in the latest issue of *Nuova Unità*, says that after the U.S. held a military conference on Guam to expand its war in Vietnam, it has begun to formulate detailed military plans. The statement says: "These plans will lead to intensified aggression against Vietnam, and their target is the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is a bastion of the struggle for freedom of the peoples and the main obstacle to the imperialists' plan to dominate the world."

The statement points out that the behavior of U.S. imperialism is encouraged by the Soviet revisionist leadership, who are closely colluding with the U.S. rulers in conspiratorial activities. The statement says, "At a time when U.S. imperialism is becoming more savage in its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, when U.S. pirate planes are carrying out barbaric attacks on Vietnamese women, the elderly, and children, and when U.S. imperialism is plotting to invade China, the Soviet revisionist leadership is increasing its frequent contacts with the U.S. imperialist butchers, openly and secretly colluding with them." The statement points out that the Soviet revisionists are doing this to allow U.S. imperialism to more freely escalate its war in Vietnam and its hostility towards China.

The statement finally calls on the Italian people to strengthen and expand their struggle against U.S.-led world imperialism and its accomplices until they are thoroughly defeated.

	Moscow, April 30 (New China News Agency) The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), *Vanguard*, published an article on April 30 strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for escalating its aggression in Vietnam and the Soviet revisionist leadership for eagerly acting as U.S. imperialism's accomplices.

	The article says that recently, U.S. leaders held a meeting in Guam and decided to further intensify U.S. aggression in Vietnam. After this meeting, there was even talk of using "limited" nuclear weapons in Vietnam.

	The article points out that while U.S. imperialism is playing the "peace talks" trick, it is actually intensifying its aggression, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender through more barbaric war actions. The article emphasizes that this is not only blackmail against the Vietnamese people but also blackmail against all the peoples of the world. U.S. imperialism's "desperate struggle" reflects its increasing desperation in Vietnam.

	The article continues: "The Soviet revisionist leadership is helping the U.S. imperialists, who are facing defeat in Vietnam, from all sides." The Soviet revisionist leadership not only helps U.S. imperialism carry out the "peace talks" trick but also actively paves the way for the "gradual escalation" of U.S. imperialism's war in Vietnam. Under the pretext of "peaceful coexistence," they are developing "peaceful" trade, "friendly" relations, and "cultural" exchanges with U.S. imperialism, which is daily intensifying its aggression in Vietnam.

	The article concludes by stressing: U.S. imperialism must withdraw all its troops from Vietnam! U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!

    意大利共产党（马列）政治局发表公报
    揭露苏修鼓励美帝侵越反华
    澳《先锋报》谴责苏修充当美帝帮凶
    新华社三十日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）政治局发表公报，谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南的战争，并且谴责苏联修正主义领导集团鼓励和支持美帝国主义侵略越南和反对中国。
    登载在最近出版的《新团结报》上的这个公报说，美国在关岛举行扩大侵越战争的军事会议以后，已经着手制订详细的军事计划。公报说：“这些计划将导致加紧对越南的侵略，它们的矛头是指向中华人民共和国的。中华人民共和国是争取自由的人民的堡垒，是阻止帝国主义实现称霸世界的计划的主要障碍。”
    公报指出，美帝国主义的行为受到苏联修正主义领导集团的鼓励，他们同美国统治者紧密勾结，进行阴谋活动。公报说，正当美帝国主义越来越凶恶地对越南人民进行侵略战争的时候，正当美国强盗飞机对越南妇女、老人和儿童进行野蛮袭击的时候，正当美帝国主义正在制订侵略中国的计划的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团却同美帝国主义凶手加强频繁接触，明里暗里进行勾结。公报指出，苏修这样做，是为了让美帝国主义更加放手地扩大侵越战争和反对中国。
    公报最后号召意大利人民加强和扩大反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争，直到彻底打败它们为止。
    新华社墨尔本三十日电　澳大利亚共产党
  （马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》三十日发表文章，强烈谴责美帝国主义加紧扩大侵越战争和苏联修正主义领导集团竭力充当美帝国主义的帮凶。
    文章说，最近美国的头目们在关岛举行会议，决定再度加紧美国对越南的侵略。在这次会议以后，甚至出现了在越南使用“有限的”核武器的谈论。
    文章指出，美帝国主义一面大耍“和谈”阴谋，一面加紧扩大侵略，妄图用更加野蛮的战争行动来使越南人民投降。文章强调说，这不仅是对越南人民进行的讹诈，而且也是对全世界人民进行的讹诈。美帝国主义的这种“拚命的挣扎”，正是反映了它在越南“越来越走投无路”。
    文章接着说：“苏联修正主义领导集团正在从各方面帮助在越南面临失败的美帝国主义。”苏联修正主义领导集团既帮助美帝国主义推行“和谈”阴谋，又积极为美帝国主义侵越战争的“逐步升级”铺平道路。他们还在“和平共处”的名目下，同天天在加紧侵略越南的美帝国主义发展“和平”贸易、“友好”关系和“文化”交流。
    文章最后强调说：美帝国主义必须从越南撤出它的全部军队，美国侵略者滚出越南！
