The first quarter of this year saw a significant increase in the purchase of fat pigs and fresh eggs in Shandong Province compared to the same period last year. The province's purchase of fat pigs increased by 58.5% and fresh eggs by 55%. This not only fully met the supply needs of urban and rural markets within the province but also exceeded the planned quotas for external transfers and exports. Notably, the first quarter saw the shipment of pork to Beijing, Shanghai, Gansu, Hubei, the three northeastern provinces, and Guangzhou, nearly four times the original plan. The export volume of pork also exceeded the original plan by 40%.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary people across Shandong responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They vigorously developed pig and poultry farming. By the beginning of this year, the stock of pigs and chickens had far surpassed historical records.

    山东肥猪鲜蛋收购量大增长
    山东省第一季度肥猪、鲜蛋的收购数量比去年同期大幅度增长。第一季度，全省肥猪的收购量比去年同期增长百分之五十八点五；鲜蛋的收购量比去年同期增长百分之五十五。这不仅充分满足了省内城乡市场的供应，而且还超额完成了外调和出口任务。其中，第一季调运北京、上海、甘肃、湖北、东北三省和广州等省市的猪肉比原计划超过近四倍，猪肉出口数量比原计划超过百分之四十。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，山东各地广大贫下中农和革命群众，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，大力发展养猪、家禽事业，到今年年初，生猪和鸡的存养量都大大突破了历史最高纪录。
