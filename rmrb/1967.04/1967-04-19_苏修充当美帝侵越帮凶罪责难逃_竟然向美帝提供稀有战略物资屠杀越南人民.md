The Soviet revisionists' guilt as accomplices to U.S. imperialism in aggressing Vietnam is indisputable. They have actually provided the U.S. with rare strategic materials to massacre the Vietnamese people.

New China News Agency, April 18th—According to U.S. publications, the Dow Chemical Company, due to a shortage in the supply of magnesium, a crucial raw material for the production of napalm bombs and aircraft, shipped four batches of magnesium from the Soviet Union via the port of Houston from December 1, 1966, to January 30, 1967.

An American magazine reported, "As the number of U.S. aircraft lost in Vietnam increases, the large amount of magnesium needed to replace these aircraft is difficult for the Dow Chemical Company to obtain. Besides purchasing all the magnesium from the U.S. strategic material reserves and some from Western Europe, 'the only other source is the Soviet Union.' This magazine stated that once the Soviet magnesium is made into U.S. aircraft, it can be dispatched to various locations for use, such as in North Vietnam."

A "secret" of the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism has been exposed. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has sunk to such a degree that they actually supply the U.S. imperialists with the rare strategic material magnesium to manufacture modern bombs and aircraft to massacre the Vietnamese people.

    苏修充当美帝侵越帮凶罪责难逃
    竟然向美帝提供稀有战略物资屠杀越南人民
    新华社十八日讯　据美国报刊透露，美国道氏化学公司，由于制造凝固汽油弹和飞机的重要原料之一镁的供应不足，从去年十二月一日到今年一月三十日之间，经豪斯顿港运到四批苏联镁。
    一家美国杂志说，“美国在越南损失的飞机日益增加，单是为补充这些飞机，所需要的大量镁原料，道氏化学公司也难以获得足够的数量。”它除了从美国的战略物资储存中购买了全部的镁和从西欧购买一部分外，“尚有唯一一个来源，那就是苏联”。这家杂志说，苏联的镁，一经制成美国飞机，即可派往各地使用，例如在北越。
    苏修美帝相互勾结的一个“秘密”被泄露了。苏修统治集团已经堕落到这等地步，竟然以稀有的战略物资镁，供给美帝国主义制造现代化的炸弹、飞机去屠杀越南人民。
