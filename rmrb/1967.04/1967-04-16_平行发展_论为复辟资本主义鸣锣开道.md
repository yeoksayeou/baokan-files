Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people overthrew the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, achieved victory in the democratic revolution, and faced the crucial question of whether to take the socialist or capitalist road. In the sharp struggle between these two paths, the top capitalist-roader within the Party vigorously advocated for the preservation of private ownership of the means of production, attempting to develop capitalism and fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's theory of transforming the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution.

In 1951, in a report, he strongly advocated for the maintenance of the capitalist exploitation system, fully exposing his ugly face as a spokesman for the bourgeoisie. He said: "In the future, we will implement socialism, but not now.... If we take socialist steps now, nationalizing industries, it will not benefit the people.... It will harm the enthusiasm for industrial production. In the countryside, we have advocated for getting rich through labor. What is getting rich through labor? It means getting rich through labor, and peasants like to get rich.... Harming the production enthusiasm of private industrialists and individual producers is destructive. This is reactionary, this is the so-called 'leftist' error."

Look, how this top capitalist-roader within the Party fears touching the interests of "private industrialists," and how he detests the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. From his speech, it is not difficult to understand why, immediately after the country's liberation, he vigorously advocated for the development of capitalism in both rural and urban areas, spreading the fallacy of "progressive exploitation," encouraging capitalists to engage in "more exploitation, greater exploitation," and shouting for the long-term "protection of the rich peasant economy," claiming that "a few primary cooperatives cannot be called the sprouts of socialism.... We need to cooperate, but the conditions are not ripe."

Using "conditions are not ripe" to fiercely oppose the socialist revolution is a common trick used by all revisionists serving the bourgeoisie. If we look back at the ugly history of revisionism, we will find that the top capitalist-roader within the Party is merely peddling old revisionist goods.

"We have not yet grown to the point of realizing socialism.... We have not yet achieved the objective economic prerequisites for socialism." "Productive forces have not yet developed to the level of realizing socialism." These are old, hackneyed phrases that old revisionists have sung a thousand times. The top capitalist-roader within the Party, during China's socialist revolution, picked up these rags, fully proving that he is a faithful disciple of old revisionism.

This fallacy of "conditions are not ripe" is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1949, the Chinese proletariat seized national power, established a people's democratic dictatorship (essentially proletarian dictatorship), and basically completed the tasks of the democratic revolution. This prepared all the necessary conditions, politically and economically, for the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in "On New Democracy" that: "In the two revolutionary stages, the first prepares the conditions for the second, and the two stages must be linked, without inserting a stage of bourgeois dictatorship." The top capitalist-roader within the Party repeatedly shouted that the time for implementing socialism in China is not ripe, with the purpose of protecting and developing capitalism.

To achieve this goal, he fabricated an even more absurd "parallel development" theory, claiming that: "The scope of private enterprises is very large and can develop in parallel with state-owned enterprises." As long as one day private enterprises develop to the point of overproduction, we can restrict private capital, and socialism can be realized. This is pure revisionist goods.

Old and new revisionists are of the same breed. As early as the period of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union, people like Bukharin spread the absurd "balance" theory. He said that the socialist and capitalist components in the national economy could "move forward along different tracks peacefully, without colliding with each other." "Balancing each other."

The top capitalist-roader within the Party inherited and developed the fallacies of revisionists like Bukharin. Bukharin believed that these two economic components could coexist peacefully, without interfering with each other, developing in parallel. While the top capitalist-roader within the Party not only believed they could develop in parallel but also that they could "fully cooperate, benefiting each other," "mutually supporting each other." This is truly "surpassing the master."

Comrade Stalin, in refuting this fallacy, pointed out sharply:

"This theory has nothing in common with Leninism.... The purpose of this theory is to maintain the position of individual peasant economy, arming the kulaks with 'new' theoretical weapons to oppose collective farms, destroying the position of collective farms." The top capitalist-roader within the Party, after liberation in China, vigorously spread the "parallel development" theory, with the purpose of strangling state-owned enterprises, developing private enterprises; strangling the collective economy, developing the private economy; strangling socialism, developing capitalism.

With a single-minded desire to preserve private ownership, constantly thinking about developing capitalism, this is the reactionary nature of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. His entire history of evil on the Chinese stage fully shows that he has schemed to preserve private ownership and develop capitalism. He is not a revolutionary but a bourgeois agent who has infiltrated the Party.

We must raise the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely criticize and expose this faithful disciple of revisionism—the Chinese Khrushchev.

    “平行发展”论为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道
    北京地质学院《东方红》编辑部　何方
    我国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导下，推翻了蒋介石反动派的统治，取得民主革命的胜利以后，摆在我国人民面前的首要问题是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路。在两条道路的尖锐斗争中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派极力鼓吹保存生产资料私有制，妄图发展资本主义，疯狂反对毛主席关于把民主革命转变为社会主义革命的理论。
    一九五一年，他在一个报告中，就极力鼓吹维护资本主义剥削制度，充分暴露了他作为资产阶级代言人的丑恶嘴脸。他说：“将来我们是要搞社会主义的，但是现在不搞，……如果现在就采取社会主义步骤，把工业收起来，对人民没有利益，……就要伤害工业生产的积极性。在农村我们曾经宣传过劳动致富。什么是劳动致富呢？就是劳动发财，农民是喜欢发财的。……伤害私人工业家和个体生产者的生产积极性，这是破坏作用。这是反动的，这是所谓‘左’的错误。”
    看，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派多么害怕触动“私人工业家”的利益，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造多么深恶痛绝。看了他的讲话，就不难理解他为什么在全国刚一解放的时候，就极力鼓吹在农村和城市都要大力发展资本主义，散布“剥削进步”的谬论，鼓励资本家进行“更多的剥削，更大的剥削”，并且叫嚷要长期“保护富农经济”，胡说什么“几个初级合作社不能叫做社会主义萌芽，……要合作化，条件不成熟”。
    以“条件不成熟”来拚命反对社会主义革命，这是为资产阶级效劳的一切修正主义分子惯用的伎俩。只要我们翻一翻修正主义的丑史，就会发现：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派贩卖的，只不过是老修正主义的旧货。
      “我们还没有成长到实现社会主义的地步……我们还没有实现社会主义的客观经济前提。”“生产力还没有发展到足以实现社会主义的水平”。这就是老修正主义者唱过千百次的陈词滥调。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在我国进行社会主义革命的时候，又拾起这些破烂，充分证明他是老修正主义者的忠实门徒。
    这种“条件不成熟”的谬论，是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的。
    一九四九年，我国无产阶级取得了全国的政权，建立了人民民主专政（实质上即无产阶级专政），基本上完成了民主革命的任务。这就从政治上、经济上准备了一切必要的条件，从民主革命转变为社会主义革命。毛主席早在《新民主主义论》中就明确指出：“两个革命阶段中，第一个为第二个准备条件，而两个阶段必须衔接，不容横插一个资产阶级专政的阶段”。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不断叫嚣在中国实行社会主义的时机不到，目的就在于保护资本主义，发展资本主义。
    为了达到这种目的，他还编造了一种更荒谬的“平行发展”论，胡说什么：“私人企业的活动范围很大，可以和国营企业平行发展。”只要有一天私人企业发展到生产过剩时，我们对私人资本一限制，社会主义就可以实现。这是地地道道的修正主义货色。
    新老修正主义者是一脉相承的。早在苏联实行农业集体化时期，布哈林之流就散布过荒谬的“平衡”论。他说什么国民经济中社会主义成分和资本主义成分，可以“沿着不同的轨道和平地向前移动，互不相撞。”“彼此‘平衡’”。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，继承并发展了布哈林等修正主义分子的谬论。布哈林认为这两种经济成分可以和平共处，互不干涉，平行发展。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不仅认为可以平行发展，而且还可以“完全合作，彼此有益”，“互相照顾”。这可是“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。
    斯大林同志在批驳这种谬论时一针见血地指出：
  “这种理论和列宁主义毫无共同之处。……这种理论的目的是要保持个体农民经济的阵地，用‘新的’理论武器把富农分子武装起来反对集体农庄，破坏集体农庄的阵地。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，解放后在中国极力散布“平行发展”论，其目的就是要扼杀国营企业，发展私人企业；扼杀集体经济，发展私人经济；扼杀社会主义，发展资本主义。
    一心保存私有制，念念不忘发展资本主义，这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反动本性。他在中国历史舞台上的全部罪恶史，都说明他为了保存私有制和发展资本主义而费尽了心机。他根本不是一个革命者，而是一个混进党内的资产阶级的代理人。
    我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，坚决批倒、斗臭这个修正主义者的忠实门徒——中国的赫鲁晓夫。
