African people heartily love and admire the great leader Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as the "red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world." They highly commend Mao Zedong Thought as the driving force and source for the oppressed people to destroy the old world and create a new one.

A young man named Simon from the Congo (Brazzaville) wrote in a letter to his Chinese friend: "Not only do the Chinese people admire Chairman Mao, but I also admire Chairman Mao. I wish Chairman Mao a long life! A long life!" Simon continued, "Through continuously studying the thoughts of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, I have come to understand that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can we shatter the various plots and schemes of imperialism, colonialism, and reactionary forces. Only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can we overcome any difficulties." Simon concluded his letter with an excited shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the advanced thought of contemporary Lenin!"

A friend named Etienne from the Congo (Léopoldville) wrote in a letter:

"In the world, there is only one most beloved revolutionary leader, and that is Chairman Mao Zedong." He said passionately, "Our great leader, the one we respect and love, the great Chairman Mao, is the red sun in the hearts of the people of all countries. The thought of our great teacher is like the sun, forever shining brightly." He said, "The revolutionary people of the whole world love the great Chairman Mao. Because his thought gives us the courage to fight against all the bad people, because his thought gives us the courage to overcome all obstacles." He went on to point out that Mao Zedong Thought inspires the revolutionary people of the whole world to completely eliminate imperialists, revisionists, and colonialists. He said, "The imperialists and revisionists oppose China because Chairman Mao leads China in leading the world revolution." He concluded his letter with a shout: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao a long life! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

An Algerian painter said, "The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America all love Chairman Mao very much and all want to take the revolutionary path. The people of the world are looking towards Tiananmen Square, looking towards Chairman Mao. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have Mao Zedong Thought, which forms a encirclement against imperialism." A visiting African student said, "No matter how rampant American imperialism and revisionism are, Mao Zedong Thought is invincible and indestructible. Now, Mao Zedong Thought has actually gone beyond the borders of China, guiding the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. We believe that this struggle will definitely achieve victory."

A friend from Sudan said, "We have already drawn a clear line with revisionism, and we take Mao Zedong Thought as our highest directive." He firmly said, "We believe that the revolutionary flames of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will definitely burn imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries to ashes."

A writer from Zimbabwe said, "Our armed struggle is conducted according to the truth expounded by Chairman Mao, and it is the result of combining Chairman Mao's theories with our country's actual situation." He mentioned that in Zimbabwe, the enemy has airplanes and automatic weapons, as well as newspapers, radio stations, and other propaganda machines, while the people of Zimbabwe have only a few guns, bows, and spears. However, the people of Zimbabwe stand on the side of the revolution, and their cause is just; they will definitely win. This writer said, "Our current task is to learn from the experience of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese revolution to mobilize the masses, to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and to better conduct armed struggle."

In Syria, an African friend named Omar praised Chairman Mao as "the only great leader of the working people and every revolutionary fighter in the world."

He said, "The oppressed people of the world united under the banner of Chairman Mao will definitely eliminate international imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries." He concluded, "We have a common goal, which is to bury imperialism in the world, and that day is not far away."

    非洲人民衷心热爱和敬仰伟大领袖毛主席
    全世界人民在毛主席旗帜下联合起来
    据新华社讯　非洲人民衷心热爱和敬仰伟大的领袖毛主席。他们热情赞扬毛主席是“世界革命人民心中的红太阳”。他们高度称颂毛泽东思想是被压迫人民摧毁旧世界、创立新世界的动力和源泉。
    一位名叫西蒙的刚果（布）青年在写给他的中国朋友的信中说：“不仅中国人民敬仰毛主席，我也敬仰毛主席。我祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”西蒙接着说：“由于不断地学习我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的思想，我懂得了，只有依靠毛泽东思想，我们才能够粉碎帝国主义、殖民主义和反动势力的各种阴谋诡计，只有依靠毛泽东思想，我们才能够战胜任何困难。”西蒙最后在信中激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！当代列宁的先进思想万岁！”
    一位名叫埃蒂安纳的刚果（利）朋友在信中说：
  “在世界上只有一位最受爱戴的革命领袖，那就是毛泽东主席。”他热情洋溢地说：“我们的伟大领袖，我们所尊敬和爱戴的伟大的毛主席，是世界各国人民心中的红太阳。我们的伟大导师的思想，象太阳一样永远光焰无际。”他说：“全世界革命人民都热爱伟大的毛主席。因为他的思想使我们有勇气同所有的坏人作斗争，因为他的思想使我们敢于战胜一切障碍。”他接着指出，毛泽东思想鼓舞全世界革命人民把帝国主义者、修正主义者和殖民主义者统统消灭掉。他说：“帝国主义者和修正主义者所以反对中国，那是因为毛主席领导下的中国领导着世界革命。”他在信中高呼：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    阿尔及利亚一位画家说：“亚非拉人民都非常热爱毛主席，都要走革命的道路。世界人民都在望着天安门，望着毛主席。亚非拉人民有了毛泽东思想，就形成了对帝国主义的包围圈。”一位来访的非洲学生谈到：“不管美帝国主义、修正主义怎样猖狂，毛泽东思想是不可战胜的，不可摧毁的。现在，毛泽东思想实际上已超出了中国的范围，指导着世界人民的革命斗争，我们相信这个斗争一定会取得胜利。”
    苏丹一位朋友说：“我们已经和修正主义划清了界线，我们把毛泽东思想作为自己的最高指示。”他坚定地说：“我们相信，亚非拉人民革命的熊熊烈火，定会把帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派烧得一干二净。”
    津巴布韦的一位作家说：“我们的武装斗争，是根据毛主席所阐明的真理来进行的，是把毛主席的理论和我国的实际情况相结合的结果。”他谈到，在津巴布韦，敌人有飞机和自动化武器，有报纸电台等宣传机器，而津巴布韦人民除少数枪支外，就是弓箭和长矛。但是，津巴布韦人民站在革命的一边，他们的事业是正义的，他们一定能胜利。这位作家说：“我们现在的任务，就是要学习毛主席领导中国革命发动群众的经验，用毛泽东思想武装群众，更好地进行武装斗争。”
    在叙利亚的一位非洲朋友欧马尔赞扬毛主席“是全世界劳动人民和每一个革命战士的唯一的伟大领袖”。
    他说：“在毛主席的旗帜下联合起来的全世界的被压迫人民一定能够消灭国际帝国主义和各国反动派。”他最后说：“我们有着共同的目标，这就是在全世界埋葬帝国主义，而这一天已经不远了。”
