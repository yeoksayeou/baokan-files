A recent incident in the U.S. Fort Dix military camp reflects how ridiculously afraid the U.S. imperialists are of the boundless thought of Mao Zedong.

According to the U.S. magazine "Challenge," a young American worker who opposes the Vietnam War was drafted despite his refusal to sign the "loyalty oath." Before reporting for duty, he obtained a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He brought this little red book to the Fort Dix military camp for training new recruits.

When the sergeant in charge of receiving new recruits saw the young man holding this little red book, he immediately took him to see the camp's intelligence chief. The intelligence chief, upon seeing "Quotations from Chairman Mao," became tense, quickly grabbed the book, and flipped through it. He then began interrogating the new recruit: "Was this book given to you by someone else, or are you one of the distributors of this book yourself?" "How many copies of this book have you distributed in this camp?" However, the new recruit consistently refused to answer his questions. The intelligence chief hurriedly checked the new recruit's file with the draft board. In the end, the terrified camp authorities returned his belongings, expelled him from the camp, and gave him a notice stating that he was "not suitable for military service under the current circumstances."

Afterward, the Fort Dix camp authorities were still uneasy and organized a special search, fearing that there might be more copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in the camp.

    光辉的毛泽东思想使美帝怕得发抖
    美国兵营中发现《毛主席语录》，美军当局惊慌失措赶忙进行大搜查
    本报讯　最近在美国狄克斯堡兵营中发生的一件事情，反映出美帝国主义对光焰无际的毛泽东思想害怕到多么可笑的程度。
    据美国《挑战》月刊报道，有一个反对侵越战争的美国青年工人，虽然拒绝在“忠诚宣誓书”上签字，还是被强征入伍。他在去报到以前，得到了一本《毛主席语录》。他把这本红宝书带到了训练新兵的狄克斯堡兵营。
    当负责接收新兵的军曹发现这个青年拿着这本小红书后，马上把他带去见兵营的情报头子。情报头子看到那本《毛主席语录》，就紧张起来，把书抓过去很快翻了一遍，接着就审问这个新兵：“是别人给你这本书的呢，还是你自己就是这本书的散发人之一呢？”“这种书你在这个兵营里已散发了多少本？”但是，这个新兵始终拒绝回答他的问题。情报头子赶紧向征兵站查询这个新兵的档案。最后，吓得要死的兵营当局把他的衣物交还给他，把他送出兵营，给了他一份通知，上面写着，他“在目前情况下不适宜于服兵役”。
    事后狄克斯堡兵营当局很不放心，专门组织了一次搜查，深怕在兵营里还有更多的《毛主席语录》。
