The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a torrential flood, roars and surges forward. It can be proudly said that the scale, power, and breadth of mobilization of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the depth of the movement, are unprecedented in history.

Chairman Mao said, "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious." One of the greatest achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the emergence of a large number of young revolutionary pioneers. Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, they are all full of vigor and vitality, full of youthful spirit, brave and wise, able to speak and act; they have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

They were the first to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, ruthlessly exposing the criminal facts of the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They established the Red Guards, a revolutionary mass organization with strong vitality, and with great revolutionary spirit, they fought bravely, sweeping away ghosts and monsters, destroying the Four Olds, and cleansing the filth left over from the old society. After the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, the Red Guard youths, following Chairman Mao's instructions, implemented the great alliance of revolutionary masses and the "three-in-one combination," bravely seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage. In the struggle for power, they put forward the banner of seizing the power of the "self" in one's mind at the same time as seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which is of great significance. They also put forward the important proposal of self-criticism while fighting....

In every stage of the movement, they were always at the forefront, bravely advancing along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. Their general direction has always been correct.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, points out: "A large number of originally unknown revolutionary young people have become brave pioneers. They have courage and wisdom. They use the forms of big-character posters, big debates, big exposure, and big criticism to resolutely attack those open and hidden representatives of the bourgeoisie. In such a great revolutionary movement, they are bound to have this or that shortcoming, but their revolutionary general direction has always been correct." Half a year of revolutionary practice has fully proven the correctness of this judgment.

To ensure that our Party and country do not change color, we need to cultivate and train thousands and tens of thousands of reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. This is a strategic task of great significance.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and for training thousands and tens of thousands of successors to the cause of communism. Only in the waves of revolution can one truly understand class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, learn to distinguish class relations and friends and enemies in the complex struggle of various political forces, learn to grasp the general direction of the struggle, and master the strategic and tactical principles of the struggle. Only in class struggle can one break away from selfishness and establish public spirit, tempering revolutionary fighters with high communist morality. In a word, only in the stormy waves of class struggle can one truly learn the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Lenin said: "In a revolutionary period, tens of millions of people learn in one week what they would learn in a year of confused life." Young pioneers with a strong political sensitivity are even more so. The waves of class struggle, one after another, rush towards them, which makes them quickly learn the real skills of class struggle.

We all have the feeling that since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the changes have been tremendous. In a short period of time, people have seen so many unprecedented and unheard-of great events, experienced so many moving and earth-shaking struggles. Many things that were not dared to be thought of, said, or done in the past have "surprisingly" appeared and been achieved. Those who were originally regarded as "ignorant children" are now pointing out the way and writing passionately, discussing national affairs; some unknown youths, after a few months of tempering, have become representatives of the movement in factories, rural areas, schools, and organizations. A large number of successors to the cause of communism who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary cause are growing and strengthening like bamboo shoots after a rain.

Red Guard youths, in the process of growth, of course, cannot be without shortcomings and are bound to make some mistakes. Some of them may even make relatively serious mistakes. This is because: first, they are young and inexperienced; second, they are to varying degrees influenced by non-proletarian thoughts. However, struggling against mistakes and shortcomings is a necessary condition for revolutionary youths to temper themselves, make themselves stronger, and wiser.

Different classes have different attitudes towards the growth of young revolutionary pioneers.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on a reactionary stance hate our Red Guard youths to the core and try every means to find fault with them, launching vicious attacks on them. Once they see that they have made some mistakes, they rejoice and exaggerate them, trying to beat them to death with one stick.

Someone ferociously scolds the Red Guard youths: "You have made a directional mistake in attacking me in the past!" The general direction of the revolutionary youths' attack has always been correct, and the spearhead of their struggle has always been aimed at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In such a large-scale mass movement, it is possible that they may have criticized their own people too much, which is completely understandable. If they are revolutionary comrades, they should treat the revolutionary youths with the spirit of "the speaker is blameless, the listener takes heed," sincerely welcoming the revolutionary youths' criticism and help. To seize on the revolutionary youths' shortcomings and launch vicious attacks, engaging in revenge, shows that they are not revolutionary comrades but enemies of the revolution, which further proves that the revolutionary youths' attack is completely correct. Some comrades who are influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line also follow the class enemies in talking nonsense. These comrades should wake up and quickly correct their mistakes, stand on the side of the revolutionary proletarian faction, and support the revolutionary youths.

"You have supported the wrong people!" Someone launches a vicious attack on the proletarian headquarters that supports the revolutionary pioneers.

Revolutionary youths are a new force. Proletarian revolutionaries always closely watch new things and give them the most resolute support, actively guiding them forward, applauding their birth, cheering for their battles, clearing the way for their development, and rejoicing in their victories. To support revolutionary pioneers is to support their revolutionary general direction, to support the revolution. Some people with ulterior motives seize on the revolutionary youths' shortcomings and mistakes, directing their spears at the proletarian headquarters that supports them, which is absolutely not allowed.

Diligent gardeners always discover and support new sprouts in time. The struggle of life itself will select the most vigorous sprouts from among them. Proletarian revolutionaries resolutely support and cultivate the revolutionary youths who have emerged in the movement. The process of class struggle will select the strongest revolutionaries from among them.

We must solemnly warn those gentlemen who launch vicious attacks on the revolutionary youths: to deny the young revolutionary pioneers is to deny the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to attack the young revolutionary pioneers is to attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. New forces are indestructible. Your stubbornness will only hasten your doom.

Some people, due to the bourgeois worldview in their minds, become confused when class enemies seize on the revolutionary youths' shortcomings and mistakes, exaggerating and attacking them, always feeling that the revolutionary youths have many mistakes.

These people's standpoint and methods in looking at problems are wrong.

In looking at problems, one must distinguish between the main trend and the secondary trend, the essence and the phenomenon. For revolutionary youths, mistakes and shortcomings are the secondary trend, compared to their achievements, they are only one finger among ten. In 1955, when Chairman Mao criticized those who made right-opportunistic errors in the agricultural cooperativization, he pointed out: "They do not look at the essential and main aspects of the problem, but emphasize those non-essential and non-main aspects. It should be pointed out: one should not neglect non-essential and non-main aspects of the problem, and must solve them one by one. But one should not regard these as the essence and the main trend, so as not to be confused about one's direction." We must firmly remember this teaching.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a great revolutionary movement to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, prevent capitalist restoration, and prevent our country from changing color, and it is a top priority for the fate of our country and the world revolution. In this great revolutionary movement, young revolutionary pioneers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, charge into battle and have made great achievements. They have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought, and extreme hatred for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the essence and main trend of the young revolutionary pioneers. First of all, we should put down our arrogance and humbly learn from their revolutionary spirit. If we do not see the essence and main trend of the revolutionary youths but seize on their shortcomings and mistakes and do not let go, even denying their revolutionary general direction, we will make a big mistake.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow up in the tempering of great revolutionary storms and waves." We should, with the greatest enthusiasm and effort, care for and encourage the growth of the young generation of revolutionary youths in the fiery struggle of the masses, and select and cultivate revolutionary successors.

The extreme hatred and vicious attacks of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road on the revolutionary youths can only make the revolutionary youths temper themselves to be stronger. The enemies' attacks and curses not only make the revolutionary youths learn the skills to defeat the enemies but also make them awaken faster, throwing off the thoughts and styles of the exploiting class from themselves. From the cruel struggle, they deeply realize that all non-proletarian thoughts can only be beneficial to the enemies and not to the revolutionary cause. To achieve victory for the revolutionary cause and to defeat the enemies, one must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely eliminate the dirty things in one's mind. Recently, the revolutionary youths have put forward the slogan of overthrowing the "self," consciously carrying out rectification, which shows that under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the young revolutionary pioneers have already understood this truth very well.

Marx teaches the working class: "Not only to change the existing conditions, but also to change yourselves, so that you have the ability to rule politically, you may have to go through fifteen, twenty, or fifty years of civil war and international conflict." This is even more so for young revolutionary pioneers. In the entire transitional period from capitalism to communism, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for state power will never end. The revolutionary youths of the proletariat must undergo a long period of tempering in class struggle to become strong proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is getting better and better. However, the revolutionary proletarian faction must maintain a sober political mind. The enemy "will never put down their butcher's knife, and they will never become Buddhas." Currently, a counter-revolutionary restoration tide has appeared. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road collude with the ghosts and monsters in society, directing their spears at the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary youths, launching a counterattack. Some "preservation" organizations have also revived and are stirring, shouting: "We were right in preserving in the past!" Everyone knows that they were preserving the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Red Guard youths should further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously carry out rectification, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, always maintain revolutionary vigor, further carry forward the spirit of daring to think, speak, act, venture, and struggle of the proletarian revolution, repel the new counterattack of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, determine the revolutionary general direction, fear no blows, and advance unyieldingly.

Young generation of revolutionary pioneers, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely advance in the face of the great storm of class struggle!

    迎着阶级斗争的大风浪奋勇前进
    林杰
    无产阶级文化大革命，如一泻千里的巨流，咆哮着，奔腾着，滚滚前进。可以无愧地说，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，其规模之大，威力之猛，动员群众之广，运动的深刻性，都是史无前例的。
    毛主席说，“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”无产阶级文化大革命最伟大的成果之一，就是涌现出了一大批年青的革命闯将。他们在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，个个生龙活虎，朝气勃勃，有勇有谋，说得出，做得到；为无产阶级文化大革命，建立了丰功伟绩。
    他们首先起来响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动了猛烈进攻，无情地揭露资产阶级反动路线的罪恶事实，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们创立了红卫兵这一具有强大生命力的革命群众组织，以大无畏的革命精神奋起战斗，横扫牛鬼蛇神，大破四旧，涤荡旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。上海“一月革命”之后，红卫兵小将遵照毛主席的教导，实行无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”，勇敢地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新阶段。在夺权斗争中，他们提出了在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，必须夺自己头脑中“私”字的权这个具有重大意义的口号，提出了无产阶级革命派边战斗，边整风的重要创议。……
    在运动发展的每个阶段，他们都是一马当先，冲在前头，沿着毛主席所指出的道路勇猛前进。他们的大方向始终是正确的。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》指出：“一大批本来不出名的革命青少年成了勇敢的闯将。他们有魄力、有智慧。他们用大字报、大辩论的形式，大鸣大放，大揭露，大批判，坚决地向那些公开的、隐蔽的资产阶级代表人物举行了进攻。在这样大的革命运动中，他们难免有这样那样的缺点，但是，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的。”半年来的革命实践，充分证明了这个论断的正确。
    为了保证我们的党和国家不变颜色，需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。这是一项具有伟大意义的战略任务。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是活学活用毛主席著作，造就千百万共产主义事业接班人的最好的学校。只有在革命的激浪中，才能真正懂得阶级斗争和无产阶级专政，才能学会在错综复杂的各派政治力量的斗争中，判明阶级关系，分清敌友我，学会掌握斗争的大方向，掌握斗争的战略策略。也只有在阶级斗争中，才能破私立公，锻炼出具有高度共产主义品德的革命战士。一句话，只有在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，才能真正学会战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    列宁说：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。”有着强烈的政治敏感的年青小将，更是这样。阶级斗争的浪涛，一个接着一个向他们扑来，这就促使他们迅速地学会阶级斗争的真本事。
    我们都有这样的感觉：无产阶级文化大革命以来，变化真是太大了。在短短的时间内，人们见到了多少见所未见、闻所未闻的大事，经历了多少可歌可泣、惊天动地的斗争。许多在平时不敢想、不敢说、不敢做的事，都“出乎意料”地出现了，做到了。原来被看作“不懂事的毛孩子”，现在指点江山，激扬文字，议论国家大事；一些不出名的青年，经过几个月的锻炼，成了掌握工厂、农村、大中学校和机关运动的代表人物。大批无限忠于毛泽东思想，忠于无产阶级革命事业的共产主义接班人，像雨后春笋一样，正在成长、壮大。
    红卫兵小将在成长过程中，当然不可能没有缺点，难免会犯一些错误。他们中的一些人，甚至还会犯比较严重的错误。这是因为：第一，他们年轻，没有经验；第二，他们在不同程度上，受各种非无产阶级思想的影响。但是，同错误和缺点作斗争，正是革命小将锻炼自己，使自己更加坚强起来，聪明起来的必要条件。
    不同阶级，对年青的革命闯将的成长，态度截然不同。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，恨透了我们的红卫兵小将，千方百计地要抓他们的小辫子，对他们进行恶毒的攻击。一旦看到他们犯了某些错误，便兴高采烈，竭力夸大，企图把他们一棍子打死。
    有人凶狠狠地斥责红卫兵小将：“你们过去攻我是犯了方向性错误！”革命闯将进攻的大方向始终是正确的，斗争锋芒一直指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在这样大的群众运动中，有时可能过头地批评了自己人，这是完全可以理解的。如果是革命同志，就应该本着“言者无罪，闻者足戒”的精神对待革命小将，诚恳地欢迎革命小将对自己的批评和帮助。抓住革命小将的某些缺点不放，大肆攻击，进行反攻倒算，这就说明，他们不是革命同志，而是革命的敌人，这就更加证明：革命小将攻得完全对。有些受资产阶级反动路线影响的糊涂同志，也跟着阶级敌人瞎说，这些同志应该猛醒，迅速改正错误，站到无产阶级革命派一边，支持革命小将。
    “你们支持错了！”有人对支持革命闯将的无产阶级司令部进行恶毒的攻击。
    革命小将是新生的力量。无产阶级的革命家，总是密切地注视着新事物，并给以最坚决的支持，积极地引导他们前进，为他们的诞生拍手叫好，为他们的战斗擂鼓助威，为他们的发展鸣锣开道，为他们的胜利欢欣鼓舞。支持革命闯将，就是支持他们的革命大方向，就是支持革命。一些别有用心的人，抓住革命小将的某些缺点和错误，把矛头指向支持他们的无产阶级司令部，这是绝对不能允许的。
    辛勤的园丁总是及时发现和支持新生的幼芽。生活斗争本身会从其中选出最富有生命力的幼芽来。无产阶级革命者坚决支持和培养在运动中涌现出来的革命小将，阶级斗争的进程，会从中选出最坚强的革命家。
    我们要严正地警告那些恶毒攻击革命小将的先生们：否定年青的革命闯将，就是否定无产阶级文化大革命，攻击年青的革命闯将，就是攻击无产阶级文化大革命。新生力量是打不倒的。你们一意孤行，只能加速你们的灭亡。
    有些人，由于他们头脑中的资产阶级世界观作怪，当阶级敌人抓住革命小将的某些缺点和错误，加以夸大和攻击的时候，他们就糊涂起来了，总觉得革命小将的错误不少。
    这些人看问题的立场不对头，方法不对头。
    看问题，要分清主流和支流，本质和现象。对于革命小将来说，错误和缺点是支流，比起他们的功绩来，只不过是十个指头中的一个指头。一九五五年，毛主席批评那些在农业合作化中犯了右倾机会主义路线错误的人时指出：“他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。应当指出：不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”我们必须牢牢记住这个教导。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，防止我们国家改变颜色的伟大革命运动，是关系我们国家命运和世界革命命运的头等大事。在这个伟大的革命运动中，年青的革命闯将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，冲锋陷阵，建立了巨大的功勋。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱，对毛泽东思想无限信仰，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派则极端憎恨。这就是年青的革命闯将的本质和主流。对他们的革命精神，首先应当放下架子，虚心学习。如果看不到革命小将的本质和主流，而抓住他们的某些缺点和错误不放，甚至否定他们的革命大方向，那就将犯绝大的错误。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们应该以最大的热情和努力，关怀和鼓励年青一代革命小将的成长，在火热的群众斗争中，挑选和培养革命接班人。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对革命小将的极端仇恨和恶毒攻击，只能使革命小将锻炼得更加坚强。敌人的攻击和咒骂，不仅促使革命小将学会战胜敌人的本事，而且促使他们更快地觉悟起来，抛掉自己身上的剥削阶级的思想和作风。从残酷的斗争中，他们深刻地认识到，一切非无产阶级的思想，只能有利于敌人，而不利于革命事业。为了革命事业的胜利，为了战胜敌人，必须努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决清除自己头脑中的脏东西。最近，革命小将提出了打倒“私”字的口号，自觉地进行整风，这说明，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的年青的革命闯将，他们已经很好地懂得了这个道理。
    马克思教导工人阶级：“不仅为了改变现存条件，而且为了改变自己本身，使自己具有进行政治统治的能力，你们或许不得不再经历十五年、二十年、五十年的内战和国际冲突”。对年青的革命小将来说更是这样。在从资本主义到共产主义的整个过渡时期中，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，社会主义同资本主义的斗争，无产阶级同资产阶级争夺政权的斗争，绝对不会结束。无产阶级的革命小将们，应当经受长时期的阶级斗争的磨炼，才能成为坚强的无产阶级革命家。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。但是，无产阶级革命派，必须保持清醒的政治头脑。敌人“决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。目前出现了一股反革命复辟的逆流。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结在一起，把矛头指向革命群众，指向革命小将，进行反扑。一些保字号的组织，也死灰复燃，蠢蠢欲动，大叫：我们过去保对了！大家都知道，他们保的是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。红卫兵小将们，应该进一步活学活用毛主席著作，认真整风，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，始终保持革命锐气，进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢斗争的无产阶级革命精神，打退党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的新反扑，认定革命的大方向，不怕任何打击，百折不回地向前进。
    年青一代的革命闯将们，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，迎着阶级斗争的大风浪，更勇敢地前进吧！
