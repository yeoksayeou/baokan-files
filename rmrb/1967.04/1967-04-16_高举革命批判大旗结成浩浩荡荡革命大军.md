Raise the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism to Form a Mighty Revolutionary Army

Revolutionary cadres across the nation have decided to direct their spearheads at the top capitalist-roader within the Party, combining efforts to carry out struggles, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions, departments, and units. They aim to achieve great unity through revolutionary criticism.

New China News Agency, April 15th: Revolutionary cadres across various regions have enthusiastically hailed the publication of the April 15th editorial in the People's Daily, "Raise the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism to Achieve Great Unity." They say that the editorial has expressed what they have been wanting to say. They will definitely follow the spirit of the editorial, firmly grasp the overall direction of the current revolutionary struggle, and promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres through revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary cadres in Shanghai, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Heilongjiang provinces have stated that achieving great unity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres through revolutionary criticism, and seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, is the overall direction of the current revolutionary struggle. The bourgeois reactionary line is the main obstacle to achieving great unity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres. To criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, it is necessary to direct the spearhead at the top capitalist-roader within the Party and combine this struggle with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions, departments, and units. Through joint struggle, they will further achieve great unity.

Red Guards and revolutionary students in Shanghai's schools, who are in the midst of a high tide of revolutionary criticism, have expressed their determination to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher and launch a fierce attack on the top capitalist-roader within the Party after studying the editorial of the People's Daily. Students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music have said that Chairman Mao often teaches us that the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all humanity. We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. For those classmates who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, we must patiently help them. In the struggle of revolutionary criticism, we must encourage them to join the revolution, break with the reactionary line that has poisoned them, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After studying the editorial of the People's Daily, the Red Guards and revolutionary students of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School were greatly inspired. They said that the editorial of the People's Daily has pointed out the direction for us to advance. We must be humble and modest, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry out revolutionary criticism, consolidate revolutionary great unity, promote the "three-in-one combination" of the school revolution, and always follow the great leader Chairman Mao to make revolution, to be the little red guards of Chairman Mao!

Many revolutionary young people and revolutionary teachers at Shandong University of Finance listened to the broadcast of the editorial of the People's Daily and immediately held a discussion. They unanimously agreed that the proletarian revolutionary cadres must unite, rally the majority of the masses and cadres, and concentrate their efforts to strike at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is the direction of struggle that we must always adhere to. The process of achieving great unity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres is also the process of struggling against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line they adhere to. To further consolidate and strengthen the great unity of the revolution, we must combine struggle, criticism, and transformation, continue to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly eliminate its poison. Revolutionary young people from Shandong Institute of Technology, who have already achieved great unity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres, said that in the struggle to launch a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader within the Party, their school has continuously held meetings to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and the big poisonous weed "Cultivation." Through the criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, our revolutionary great unity has become more consolidated.

In the process of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory, who have already achieved revolutionary great unity, pointed out that the top capitalist-roader within the Party not only actively promotes the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in personnel issues, but also tries every means to use the theory of "tamed tools" and "slavery" to deceive and confuse a group of masses. Therefore, to achieve revolutionary great unity, we must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party and strive to educate the deceived masses. They mentioned that this factory held six factory-wide meetings to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line in February this year. Each criticism saw a group of deceived masses rise up to accuse the bourgeois reactionary line of its crimes, returning to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and achieving revolutionary great unity by unit and by department throughout the factory in March. The revolutionary cadres of this factory expressed that in the future, they will definitely raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, and in the process of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, they will continuously consolidate the revolutionary great unity and expand the revolutionary great unity.

After the editorial of the People's Daily on April 15th was circulated in Guiyang, revolutionary cadres immediately launched a study and discussion. A revolutionary young person from Guiyang Girls' School said that after studying this editorial, I felt three points most deeply: First, at this decisive moment of waging a great struggle and criticism against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate our firepower, and direct the target of the struggle at the top capitalist-roader within the Party. We must also combine it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our region, department, and unit, and thoroughly criticize, expose, and eliminate the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating all its poison! Second, this struggle is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. We must strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves, strictly differentiate between two types of contradictions, and implement dictatorship and suppression against class enemies; for the deceived masses, we must firmly remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, adhere to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," and patiently help them recognize their mistakes, achieving the goal of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. Third, Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary great unity. Revolutionary comrades must unite under the premise of a consistent direction, and not get bogged down in trivial issues.

Representatives attending the oath-taking meeting for the revolutionary and productive movement in the industrial and transportation system of Shanxi Province studied and discussed the editorial of the People's Daily today. Everyone agreed that the bourgeois reactionary line is the main obstacle to achieving great unity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres and must be thoroughly criticized. Moreover, in the great criticism, the spearhead must be directly aimed at the top capitalist-roader within the Party who formulated and promoted the bourgeois reactionary line. The representatives also unanimously expressed that they must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and promote revolutionary great unity in the great criticism. A standing committee member of the Datong Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee said with deep feelings that the proletarian revolutionary cadres can only consolidate the revolutionary great unity by raising the banner of revolutionary criticism and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line to the point of overthrowing and exposing it. If we do not raise the banner of revolutionary criticism and instead pursue a "merger of two into one," even if we unite, we will not be able to consolidate it.

After the editorial of the People's Daily on April 15th was circulated in Heilongjiang Province, many proletarian revolutionary cadres from various fronts in Harbin immediately conducted a study and discussion. They unanimously expressed in the discussion that they would promote revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary great criticism and raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units and departments to a new level. Revolutionary young people from the 47th Middle School, who have initially achieved revolutionary great unity, excitedly said that at this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new decisive battle, the important editorial of the People's Daily has arrived, which has given us even more boundless confidence and strength. They said that every time a critical moment arrives, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee always timely point out the direction for us to advance. We must definitely raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents to the point of overthrowing and exposing it, eliminate all obstacles, better achieve revolutionary great unity, complete the great historical task of the struggle for power seizure and struggle, criticism, and transformation by the proletarian revolutionary cadres, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

    “无产阶级只有解放了全人类才能最后解放自己”
    高举革命批判大旗结成浩浩荡荡革命大军
    全国各地无产阶级革命派决心把矛头直指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，结合进行本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合
    新华社十五日讯　各地无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼《人民日报》四月十五日社论《高举革命的批判旗帜实现革命的大联合》的发表。他们说，这篇社论说出了无产阶级革命派心里要说的话，我们一定根据社论的精神，紧紧掌握当前革命斗争的大方向，在革命的大批判当中推进无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    上海、济南、青岛、山西、贵州和黑龙江等省市的无产阶级革命派说，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是当前革命斗争的大方向。资产阶级反动路线是当前实现无产阶级革命派大联合的主要障碍。要批判资产阶级反动路线，就必须把矛头直指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，并且把这场斗争同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来，通过共同的斗争，进一步实现革命的大联合。
    正处在革命的大批判高潮中的上海市大中学校红卫兵和革命师生，在认真地学习了《人民日报》社论以后纷纷表示，一定要更高地举起革命的批判旗帜，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，在大批判中推进革命的大联合。上海音乐学院的红卫兵小将们说，毛主席经常教导我们，无产阶级只有解放了全人类才能最后解放自己。要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。对于受过资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同学，我们一定要耐心地帮助他们，在大批判斗争中鼓励他们起来革命，跟毒害他们的反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。上海市第六女中的红卫兵小将和革命师生学习了《人民日报》社论后，受到极大鼓舞。她们说，《人民日报》社论给我们指出了前进的方向。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步开展革命的大批判，巩固革命的大联合，推动学校革命的“三结合”，永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席闹革命，做毛主席的红小兵！
    山东财经学院的许多革命小将和革命教师听了《人民日报》社论的广播之后，立即举行了座谈。他们一致认为，无产阶级革命派联合起来，团结大多数群众和干部，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是我们必须始终坚持的斗争大方向。无产阶级革命派大联合的过程，也就是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及他们坚持的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所制定的资产阶级反动路线进行斗争的过程。为了进一步巩固和加强革命的大联合，我们一定要结合斗批改，继续大力揭发批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清它的流毒。已经实现了无产阶级革命派大联合的山东工学院的一些革命小将说，在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的斗争中，我们学院各班级连续召开了批判资产阶级反动路线和大毒草《修养》的大会。通过对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，我们的革命大联合也越来越巩固了。
    在批判资产阶级反动路线的过程中，已经实现了革命的大联合的青岛内燃机厂无产阶级革命派指出，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派不仅在干部问题上积极推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，而且还千方百计地用“驯服工具”论和“奴隶主义”来欺骗蒙蔽一批群众，因此，我们要实行革命的大联合，就必须彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所制定的资产阶级反动路线，争取和教育受蒙蔽的群众。他们谈到，这个厂今年二月连续举行了六次全厂规模的批判资产阶级反动路线大会，每次批判都有一批受蒙蔽的群众起来控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，并且在三月间全厂实现了按单位、按部门的革命大联合。这个厂的革命派表示，今后一定要更高地举起革命的批判大旗，在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派制定的资产阶级反动路线的过程中不断巩固革命的大联合，扩大革命的大联合。
    《人民日报》十五日社论传到贵阳之后，广大革命派马上展开了学习和讨论。贵阳女中一位革命小将说，我学习了这篇社论后，感受最深的有三点：一，在当前对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线进行大批判、大斗争的决战时刻，一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，集中火力，把斗争目标直指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，并且同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，把资产阶级反动路线批深、批透、批彻底，肃清它的一切流毒！二，这场斗争是异常尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，必须严格分清敌、我、友，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，对阶级敌人就是要专政，要打击；对受蒙蔽的群众一定要牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的教导，本着“团结——批评——团结”的方针，耐心帮助他们认识错误，达到既要弄清思想，又要团结同志的目的。三，毛泽东思想是革命的大联合的灵魂。革命派的同志一定要在大方向一致的前提下团结起来，不要在枝节问题上纠缠不休。
    参加山西省工交系统抓革命、促生产誓师大会的代表们，学习和座谈了今天《人民日报》的社论。大家认为，资产阶级反动路线是当前实现无产阶级革命派大联合的主要障碍，必须彻底批判，而且要在大批判中把矛头直接指向制定和推行资产阶级反动路线的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。代表们还一致表示：一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，在大批判中推进革命的大联合。大同煤矿革命委员会的一位常务委员深有体会地说，无产阶级革命派只有高举革命的批判旗帜，把资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭，才能使革命的大联合得到巩固。如果不高举革命的批判旗帜，搞“合二而一”的大合并，即使联合了也得不到巩固。
    《人民日报》十五日社论传到黑龙江省以后，哈尔滨各条战线上的许多无产阶级革命派立即进行了学习和座谈。他们在座谈中一致表示要在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合，并且把本单位、本部门的斗批改提高到一个新的水平上来。已经初步实现革命大联合的四十七中的革命小将们兴奋地说，正当无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新的决战阶段的时候，传来了《人民日报》这篇重要的社论，这给我们更增加了无限的信心和力量。他们说，每到一个关键时刻，毛主席和党中央总是及时给我们指出前进的方向。我们一定要高举革命的批判大旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭，扫除一切障碍，更好地实现革命的大联合，完成无产阶级革命派夺权斗争和斗批改的伟大历史任务，把文化大革命进行到底。
