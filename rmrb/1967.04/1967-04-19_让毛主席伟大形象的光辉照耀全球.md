Let the Glorious Image of Chairman Mao Shine Across the Globe

The documentary film crew celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China

Chairman Mao and the People Share a Common Heart

The National Day of 1966 was a time when China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was in full swing. It was our duty to record this historic scene. However, how could we film it well? Initially, we were unsure. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's works and followed his teachings by going among the people and seeking their advice. We went to factories, and the workers said, "Among all the principles, the first is to film more scenes of Chairman Mao's activities." We went to the countryside, and the poor and lower-middle peasants said, "In a nutshell, we want to see Chairman Mao on the screen as much as possible!" We went to schools, and the revolutionary teachers and students said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and Chairman Mao is our closest relative. Our greatest wish is to see Chairman Mao more often on the screen."

Based on the people's opinions and demands, we made a firm decision to do our utmost to record every scene of Chairman Mao's great image and his bond with the people.

The red sun rose over Tiananmen Square, and Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao arrived. Some of us saw Chairman Mao for the first time. While trying to capture the scene, they quickly checked their watches to remember this most happy moment. Some cameramen, though they had seen Chairman Mao before, were still very excited to see him again. We saw Chairman Mao, looking so spirited and healthy, and we couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" Our voices blended with the cheers of thousands of people on the square.

We witnessed Chairman Mao standing on the reviewing stand for several hours to meet more people, rarely going inside to rest. When he heard the crowd shouting, "We want to see Chairman Mao, we want to see Chairman Mao," he walked from the center of the gate tower to the east side and then from the east side to the west side, trying to satisfy the wishes of the guests and the crowd. After the celebration ended in the afternoon, we were all worried that Chairman Mao was too tired and hoped he would rest early. However, he walked down from the gate tower, refused to get into the car, and walked straight towards the crowd gathered in front of Tiananmen. At this moment, the crowd surged forward like a tide, with millions of people and millions of hearts all turning towards the sunflower facing the sun—the red sun in our hearts—Chairman Mao.

On the night of the festival, Chairman Mao came to Tiananmen Square again, sat on the ground, and watched the fireworks with the people... Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the people shouted thousands and thousands of times, but it was still not enough to express their boundless love for you; they sang thousands and thousands of times, but it was still not enough to express their boundless admiration for you!

Learn from the People, Forever Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought

The filming of "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" was a process of learning from the revolutionary masses and promoting our own ideological revolution. Before filming this movie, we received a lot of inspiration and help from the revolutionary masses. To make the movie better and more able to express the revolutionary rebels' boundless love for Chairman Mao, we invited students from Beijing Mining Institute's "East Is Red Commune," Beijing Normal University's "Jinggangshan Commune," and Beijing Geological Institute's "East Is Red Commune" and other revolutionary organizations to help us edit this film. It can be said that this film is a collective creation.

At the beginning, we still followed the old routine to edit this film, making the content too extensive and the scenes too slow, failing to highlight the characteristics of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary masses' love for Chairman Mao, and failing to satisfy the audience's urgent desire to see Chairman Mao on the screen immediately. Revolutionary students pointed out this situation and gave us suggestions: edit more concisely, and use the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the red line running through this film. They said that we should concentrate the scenes that best show the people's love for Chairman Mao; they said that at the beginning of the film, when the red sun just rises, we should let the people see the red sun in our hearts—the red sun—Chairman Mao. At Chairman Mao's command, the cultural revolution army of the whole country advances bravely... We accepted these suggestions.

Our original narration script, although it mentioned the struggle between the two lines, lacked emotion and the language was dull. Revolutionary students said that your indifferent narration exposes your shallow love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and your shallow hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line. They took the initiative to rewrite it. This made the narration full of the voices of the proletarian revolutionaries:

Beijing's light is brilliant and magnificent,
Mao Zedong is the red sun in the East.
Great truth, dawn's light,
Savior of mankind, hope of the world!
Follow Mao Zedong, always make revolution,
Follow Mao Zedong, the world turns red!

The revolutionary youth's bold words not only added luster to this film, but more importantly, they educated us, making us begin to understand the important issues of the mass line in film creation and the future direction of creation. We will forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform our ideology in the fiery struggle of life, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life.

The Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionary Line

The filming and production of this film were carried out from beginning to end in the struggle between the two lines. The successful completion of this film is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The capitalist-roaders in power in the cultural circle who usurped the leadership initially attempted to use this film to beautify the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his gang, and brazenly opposed the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. After their evil plots were exposed, they then played a trick of delaying production and suppressing the revolution, making it impossible for this film to be shown to the people of the whole country and the world in a timely manner.

Now, this handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and their top backer, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, have been exposed by the revolutionary people. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, thoroughly overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the field of newsreel films!

    让毛主席伟大形象的光辉照耀全球
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年纪录片摄制组
    毛主席和群众心连心
    一九六六年的国庆，正是我国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃开展的时候。把这样的历史场面纪录下来，这是我们义不容辞的责任。但是如何才能拍好呢？起初，我们心里没有底；后来，我们学习了毛主席著作，遵照毛主席的教导，到群众中去，向群众请教。我们走到工厂，工人同志说：“千条万条，多拍毛主席活动的镜头是第一条”。我们走到农村，贫下中农说：“千言万语，总起来只有一句：让我们在电影上把毛主席看个够！”我们走到学校，革命师生说：“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，毛主席是我们最亲的亲人，我们最大的心愿，就是要在银幕上更多地看到毛主席。”
    根据群众的意见和要求，我们下定决心，保证尽最大的努力，把毛主席的伟大形象和毛主席与群众心连心的每一个镜头都纪录下来。
    天安门上升起了红太阳，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志来了。我们当中的一些同志，还是第一次见到毛主席，在“抢”镜头的同时，他们赶紧看了一下表，以便牢牢记住这最最幸福的时刻。有些摄影同志虽然见到过毛主席，但是现在再次又看到毛主席的时候，心情仍然十分激动。我们看到毛主席他老人家神采奕奕，身体这样健康，心里禁不住高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”我们的心声和广场上成千成万群众的欢呼声融成一片。
    我们亲眼看到，毛主席为了能够接见更多的群众，他老人家接连好几个钟头一直站在检阅台上，很少进去休息。当他听到天安门前的群众喊着“我们要见毛主席，我们要见毛主席”的声音以后，他老人家就从城楼中央走到东头，又从东头走到西头，尽量满足观礼外宾和群众的要求。下午，庆祝大会结束之后，我们都担心毛主席太累，希望他早些回去休息。可是，他老人家还兴致勃勃地从城楼上步行下来，并且拒绝上车，径直向停留在天安门前的群众走去。这时，群众象潮水一样地涌了过来，千万个人，千万颗心，都象向阳的葵花一般，向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳——毛主席。
    节日之夜，毛主席又一次来到天安门广场，席地而坐，和群众一起观看焰火……毛主席啊，毛主席，群众千遍万遍地欢呼，也表达不出对您的无限热爱；千次万次地欢唱，也唱不尽对您的无限敬仰！
    向群众学习，永远忠于毛泽东思想
    《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年》的摄制过程，是一个向无产阶级革命派学习，和促进自己思想革命化的过程。拍摄这部片子之前，我们从革命群众中得到了不少启发和帮助。为了把片子编得更好，更能表达革命造反派对毛主席的无限热爱，我们请来了北京矿业学院“东方红公社”、北京师范大学“井冈山公社”和北京地质学院“东方红公社”等革命组织的同学，共同编制这部影片。应该说，这部片子是集体的创作。
    开始，我们还是象过去一样，按照老一套程序来编辑这部片子，搞得内容庞杂，镜头拖沓，不能突出无产阶级文化大革命的特点，不能表达革命群众对毛主席的热爱，观众希望立刻在银幕上看到毛主席的迫切心情得不到满足。革命同学针对这种情况，向我们提出建议：编辑精炼一些，要以文化大革命运动作为贯穿这部影片的红线。他们说，应该把最能表现群众热爱毛主席的镜头集中在一起；他们说，影片一开始，红太阳刚升起来的时候，就应该让群众看到我们心中最红最红的红太阳——毛主席。毛主席一声令下，全国文化革命大军奋勇地向前进……我们接受了这些意见。
    我们原来写的解说词，虽然也提到两条路线斗争，但是缺乏感情，语言也枯燥。革命派的同学说，你们这种不痛不痒的说明词，暴露出你们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线爱之不深，对资产阶级反动路线恨之不切。他们便主动地改写。这样才使得解说词中充满了无产阶级革命派的声音：
    北京的光芒灿烂辉煌，毛泽东是东方的红太阳。
    伟大的真理，黎明的曙光，
    人类的救星，世界的希望！
    跟着毛泽东，永远闹革命，
    跟着毛泽东，世界一片红！
    革命小将的豪言壮语不仅增加了这部影片的光彩，而更重要的是教育了我们，使我们开始认识到电影创作中的群众路线和今后创作的方向等重要问题。我们要永远忠于毛泽东思想，在火热的斗争生活中彻底改造思想，为工农兵服务一辈子。
    无产阶级革命路线的胜利
    这部影片的拍摄和制作，自始至终是在两条路线的斗争中进行的。这部影片的胜利完成，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。窃踞文化界领导权的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，始则企图利用这部影片来美化党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其一伙，猖狂地反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们的罪恶阴谋被揭穿后，继而又玩弄了一套拖生产压革命的卑鄙手段，使这部影片不能及时同全国和全世界人民见面。
    现在，这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派以及他们的总后台党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，已被革命人民揪出来了。我们一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，彻底斗倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在新闻纪录电影的阵地上高高飘扬！
