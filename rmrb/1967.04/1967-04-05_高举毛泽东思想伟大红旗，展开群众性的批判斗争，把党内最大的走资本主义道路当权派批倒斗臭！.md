A new battle cry has sounded!

The journal *Red Flag* has published three articles: *"Patriotism or Treachery? – A Criticism of the Reactionary Film 'The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty,'"* *"The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized,"* and *"'Strike a Big Batch, Protect a Small Group' Is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line (A Situation Report on the Bourgeois Reactionary Line Executed by the Work Team at Tsinghua University in June and July 1966 on the Cadres Issue)."* These articles deeply expose how the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, has madly carried out activities to restore capitalism and has brazenly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They expose how this person is not a "veteran revolutionary" but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary. Exposing such a person, a personalist like Khrushchev in China, is a great joy for the revolutionary people of the entire nation! It is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We enthusiastically celebrate this great victory!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The serious struggle that unfolded in 1950 around the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty* is not just about evaluating a film; it is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and bourgeois reformism, revisionism. Ultimately, it is a struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the proletariat's resistance to restoration. The top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, along with counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Luo Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and the then-deputy director of the Central Propaganda Department, Hu Qiaomu, repeatedly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions, praising the thoroughly treacherous film *The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty* as a "patriotic" film and fiercely resisting its criticism. This was done to beautify imperialism, advocate bourgeois reformism, attack revolutionary mass movements, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. Moreover, this top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, in addition to committing serious crimes before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, has spread a large amount of revisionist poison in the political, economic, cultural, and educational domains over the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation, owing the proletariat and revolutionary people a huge debt. Now is the time for us to settle accounts with him. We must not only thoroughly criticize the reactionary film *The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty* but also thoroughly criticize this top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, better purge the revisionist poison in various domains, and thoroughly smash the class enemy's evil plot to restore capitalism in our country.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls and uproots revisionism from the ideological realm. The current criticism of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road marks the development of this ideological revolution to a new, more profound stage. The struggle between restoration and counter-restoration is deeply reflected in people's minds. Therefore, we must not only seize back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by the party person in authority taking the capitalist road but also launch an ideological struggle for power. We must, through the criticism of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, resolutely counter all challenges from the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and expose bourgeois ideology. Only in this way can the great power seized by the proletariat be unshakable and unbreakable.

Chairman Mao says: "History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed but are produced and developed through struggle. On the one hand, they must struggle against 'left' opportunism, and on the other hand, they must struggle against right opportunism. Without struggling against and thoroughly overcoming these harmful tendencies that harm the revolution and revolutionary war, the construction of the correct line and the victory of the revolutionary war are impossible." For a long time, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in sharp and intense struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee declared the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the defeat of the bourgeois reactionary line. Now, we must further thoroughly purge the poison of this bourgeois reactionary line from the ideological realm. This is a major battle in the current struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and we must achieve a complete and thorough victory in this major battle.

Currently, the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary people are, following Chairman Mao's teachings, successfully carrying out revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. At this critical moment of the struggle for power, raising the criticism of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road will not disperse forces or hinder the struggle for power. On the contrary, by thoroughly criticizing the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road and fully exposing his crimes, we can better grasp the direction of the struggle, aim our arrows at this small handful, and thus, in the common struggle, better lay the political and ideological foundations for achieving revolutionary great unity. It is precisely because we have thoroughly criticized this small handful that we can better distinguish between the small handful of party persons in authority taking the capitalist road and those who have made serious mistakes but are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements, and between those who propose the bourgeois reactionary line and those who execute this reactionary line. This will help more cadres return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, greatly promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedentedly extensive and profound mass movement. From beginning to end, it must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and let the masses educate and liberate themselves. Now, in this struggle to thoroughly criticize the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, we must also mobilize the broadest revolutionary masses to participate in the criticism and struggle. We must organize a vast proletarian revolutionary cultural army to launch a general offensive against bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened a new era of promoting Mao Zedong Thought. Such a great revolutionary mass movement, unprecedented in history, is the best school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The current mass struggle to thoroughly criticize the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road is a new, more profound stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this struggle, we proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and use the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and purge the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road in all aspects, thoroughly smashing the mad attacks of this small handful. We are confident that through this mass criticism and struggle, the invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought will be greatly popularized! The level of the billion revolutionary masses mastering Mao Zedong Thought will be greatly raised!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，展开群众性的批判斗争，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批倒斗臭！
    ——上海《解放日报》四月二日社论
    新的战斗号角响了！
    《红旗》杂志发表了《爱国主义还是卖国主义？——评反动影片〈清宫秘史〉》、《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》、《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分（一九六六年六、七两月清华大学工作组在干部问题上执行资产阶级反动路线的情况调查）》三篇文章，深刻地揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派、提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人，如何疯狂地进行资本主义复辟活动，猖狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席、反对伟大的毛泽东思想的一系列滔天罪行；揭露了他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命，反革命。把这样一个中国的赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家揪出来示众，是全国革命人民的大喜事！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！我们热烈欢呼这一伟大胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”一九五○年围绕反动电影《清宫秘史》而展开的一场严重的斗争，绝不仅仅是对一部影片的评价问题，而是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同资产阶级改良主义、修正主义思想的斗争，归根结底，是资本主义复辟同无产阶级反复辟的斗争。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬和当时的中央宣传部常务副部长胡××等，一再抗拒毛主席的指示，把彻底的卖国主义的《清宫秘史》吹捧成是“爱国主义”的影片，拚命抵制对它的批判，就是为了美化帝国主义，鼓吹资产阶级改良主义，攻击革命群众运动，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。不仅如此，这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，除了在抗日战争前后犯了一系列严重罪行以外，建国十七年来，还在政治、经济、文化、教育各个领域内散布了大量的修正主义毒素，欠下了无产阶级和革命人民一大笔债。现在，是我们向他算总账的时候了。我们不但要彻底批判《清宫秘史》这部反动影片，而且更要彻底批判这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，更好地肃清各个领域里的修正主义流毒，彻底粉碎阶级敌人在我国实现资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是一场从思想上挖掉修正主义根子的大革命。当前开展的对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判，标志着这场思想革命发展到了一个新的更加深入的阶段。复辟反复辟的斗争深刻地反映在人们的头脑里。因此，我们不仅要从党内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回被他们篡夺的党、政、财、文大权，还要从思想上展开夺权斗争。我们必须通过对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判，迎头痛击资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把资产阶级思想批透、批臭。只有这样，无产阶级所掌握的大权才是牢不可破的、不可动摇的。
    毛主席说：“历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。一方面，它要同‘左’倾机会主义作斗争，另一方面，它又要同右倾机会主义作斗争。不同这些危害革命和革命战争的有害的倾向作斗争，并且彻底地克服它们，正确路线的建设和革命战争的胜利，是不可能的。”长期以来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，一直进行着尖锐激烈的斗争。党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的失败。现在，我们要进一步从思想上彻底肃清这条资产阶级反动路线的流毒。这是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一场大决战，我们一定要在这场大决战中夺取完全的、彻底的胜利。
    当前，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，正遵循毛主席的教导，胜利地进行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。在这夺权斗争的关键时刻，提出批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，会不会分散力量、妨碍夺权斗争呢？不会！恰恰相反，通过对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的批判，把他的罪行充分暴露出来，可以使我们更好地掌握斗争的大方向，矛头对准这一小撮开火，从而在共同的斗争中，为实现革命的大联合更好地奠定政治基础、思想基础。也正因为彻底批判了这一小撮，可以使我们更好地划清党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派同犯有严重错误但还不是反党反社会主义分子的界限，划清提出资产阶级反动路线的人同执行这条反动路线的人的界限，从而促使更多的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，大大推动革命的“三结合”。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场空前广泛、空前深入的群众运动，自始至终要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。现在，在这场彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争中，同样要发动最广大的革命群众参加批判，参加斗争。我们要组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命的文化大军，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发动总攻击。
    无产阶级文化大革命，开创了大立毛泽东思想的新纪元。这样一个古今中外史无前例的伟大的革命群众运动，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好的大学校。当前批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的群众性的斗争，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个新的更加深入的阶段。在这场斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武器，彻底批判和肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒，彻底粉碎这一小撮的猖狂进攻。我们坚信，通过这一场群众性的批判斗争，战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想，必将大大普及！亿万革命群众掌握毛泽东思想的水平，必将大大提高！　（新华社上海四日电）
