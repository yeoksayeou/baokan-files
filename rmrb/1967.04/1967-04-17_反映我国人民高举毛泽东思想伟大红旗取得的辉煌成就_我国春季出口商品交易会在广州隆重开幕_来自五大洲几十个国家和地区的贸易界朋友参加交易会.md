The 1967 Spring China Export Commodities Fair opened in Guangzhou today. Held in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great achievements of the Chinese people in responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," the fair's grand scale and new appearance reflect the great achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects of politics and economy under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

At the center of Guangzhou City, in the China Export Commodities Exhibition Hall, a ten-story building, hangs a giant portrait of Chairman Mao that is three stories high, along with large banners reading "The Great, Invincible Mao Zedong Thought Shines Over the World" and "Long Live the Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In each exhibition hall, there are portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, poems by Chairman Mao, and pictures of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, inspecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution army. The Chinese trade delegations participating in the fair have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, perform revolutionary cultural programs, and hold celebrations with the guests, introducing to them the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Many guests have enthusiastically praised the hosts' revolutionary spirit and warm reception.

Participants in the fair include trade friends from dozens of countries and regions on five continents. Large numbers of foreign friends, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, upon arriving at the fair, first purchased the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao Zedong's works, and Chairman Mao badges.

The good situation in China's industrial and agricultural production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has provided a more substantial material foundation for foreign trade. This fair exhibits over 20,000 types of export commodities, with over 4,000 new products, most of which are new products produced during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In addition, it also exhibits models and samples of some of the latest achievements in China's scientific and technological and industrial production over the past few years, including the world's first successful experimental and industrial production of synthetic benzene and artificial insulin.

The new industrial products and abundant agricultural products exhibited at this fair vividly reflect the great power of Chairman Mao's call for industry to learn from Daqing and agriculture to learn from Dazhai. The chemical products exhibition hall exhibits high-grade aviation oil, the metal and mineral products exhibition hall exhibits various special-shaped steel materials and train wheel rims, all of which are achievements made by the Chinese working class in response to the great leader Chairman Mao's call. The great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in destroying the old and establishing the new are also reflected in the exhibited handicrafts, light industrial products, and textiles. Most of the exhibited handicrafts are of modern themes, and the light industrial products and textiles are both economical and practical, with beautiful and healthy designs. These exhibits have been widely praised at the fair.

The holding of this fair shows the vigorous development of China's foreign trade. Last year, China overfulfilled its export trade plan, and this year's first-quarter export trade has also increased compared to the same period last year. Under the efforts of the proletarian revolutionary faction in China's foreign trade system, this fair will surely achieve even greater success than before.

Tonight, the fair held a grand banquet with over 3,000 guests. Responsible officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the fair attended the banquet. After the banquet, the Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ballet Troupe performed the ballet "Red Detachment of Women."

    反映我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗取得的辉煌成就
    我国春季出口商品交易会在广州隆重开幕
    来自五大洲几十个国家和地区的贸易界朋友参加交易会
    新华社广州十五日电  一九六七年春季中国出口商品交易会今天在广州隆重开幕。这次交易会是在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在全国革命人民热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召获得巨大成绩的大好形势下举行的，它的盛大规模和崭新面貌，反映了我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在政治、经济各方面所取得的伟大成就。
    在广州市中心海珠广场，作为交易会会址的中国出口商品陈列馆的十层大楼上，悬挂着高达三层楼的毛主席的巨幅画像，和“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想普照全世界”、“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁”等巨幅标语。在各个陈列大厅里，挂着一幅幅的毛主席照片、毛主席语录、毛主席诗词以及毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志检阅无产阶级文化革命大军的图片。参加交易会的中国各交易团，都组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，热情地向到会来宾宣传毛泽东思想，表演革命的文艺节目，和来宾们一起联欢，向来宾们介绍我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就。许多来宾热情赞扬了主人的这种革命精神和亲切接待。
    参加交易会的有来自世界五大洲几十个国家和地区的贸易界朋友。大批外国朋友和海外华侨、港澳同胞，来到交易会后的第一件事，就是购买《毛主席语录》、毛主席著作和毛主席像章。
    我国工农业生产在无产阶级文化大革命中出现的大好形势，为对外贸易提供了更为充实的物质基础。这次交易会展出的出口商品达二万多种，新商品有四千多种，其中大部分是在无产阶级文化大革命中生产的新产品。此外，还展出了近几年来我国科学技术和工业生产上一部分最新成就的产品模型和样品，其中包括世界上第一个试验成功和投产的合成苯及人工合成胰岛素。
    这次交易会展出的崭新的工业产品和丰富的农产品，生动地反映了毛主席提出的工业学大庆、农业学大寨的巨大威力。化工馆展出的石油产品高级航空油，五金矿产馆展出的各种异型钢材以及火车车轮轮箍等，就是我国工人阶级热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召所取得的成就。无产阶级文化大革命破四旧、立四新的伟大成果，也反映在展出的工艺品、日用轻工业品和纺织品上。展出的工艺品绝大部分是现代题材，日用轻工业品和纺织品都经济实用，造型和图案设计美观健康。这些展品在交易会上普遍受到赞扬。
    这次交易会的举办，说明了我国对外贸易事业的蓬勃发展。去年我国超额完成了出口贸易计划，今年第一季度的出口贸易又比去年同期有所增长。在我国外贸系统无产阶级革命派的努力下，这次交易会必将取得比过去更大的成就。
    今晚，交易会举行了有三千多来宾参加的盛大酒会。对外贸易部和交易会的负责人出席了酒会。酒会结束后，北京工农兵芭蕾舞剧团演出了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。
