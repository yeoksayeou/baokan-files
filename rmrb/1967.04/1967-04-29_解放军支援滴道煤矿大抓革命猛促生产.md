The PLA Supports the Didao Coal Mine in Revolutionizing and Promoting Production

Promoting the great revolution and great production, uniting the majority of cadres, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers, the coal output has increased significantly.

Editor's Note: At present, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, shouldering the glorious tasks of supporting the leftist masses, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. They have gone deep into factories and rural areas, working with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize the revolution and promote production, achieving great results and creating many excellent experiences. The deeds of a certain unit of the PLA supporting the Didao Coal Mine are a prominent example.

The People's Liberation Army is a great revolutionary army that holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the personal command of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, this people's army has formed a complete set of glorious traditions in political work through long-term revolutionary struggles. It has accumulated rich experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and thoroughly addressing active thoughts. The unit supporting the Didao Coal Mine was able to help the revolutionary workers and cadres of the mine shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production because, from the outset, they emphasized supporting the proletarian revolutionaries politically, vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and doing a great deal of meticulous political and ideological work. This greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the people, arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm and boundless energy of the revolutionary workers and cadres in the mine area.

Our great leader Chairman Mao called for the nation to learn from the People's Liberation Army several years ago. Recently, Chairman Mao has again put forward the great call to support the army and love the people. The proletarian revolutionaries must learn well from the political and ideological work experiences of the PLA comrades while fighting side by side with them. They must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, adhere to the Four Firsts, carry forward the spirit of the May 4th Movement, and further strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. We believe that the great People's Liberation Army, which has established new merits in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will surely receive the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary masses; the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA will surely redouble their efforts to love the people and unite closely with the revolutionary masses, fighting together to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

A Good Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team

Didao Mine is the largest coal mine in the Jixi Mining Bureau. All the coal it produces is supplied to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party did everything they could to sabotage the revolution and production, causing the production teams to collapse and the production order to be chaotic, seriously affecting the completion of production tasks.

Under these circumstances, the PLA Black Dragon River Military Region responded to Chairman Mao's great call and sent a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to support the Jixi Mining Area in seizing the revolution and promoting production at the end of March. After entering the Didao Mine, the propaganda team immediately widely propagated Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Revolutionary Workers and Cadres of All Factories and Mines in the Country," helping the Didao Mine quickly restore production order and establish production teams. The revolutionary situation became better and better, and coal production increased significantly.

The PLA comrades supporting the Didao Mine emphasized Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics everywhere, forming a good Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. They formed six propaganda teams, going deep into each pit and office, helping to restore and improve the system of "study before class, use during class, and evaluate after class" for studying Chairman Mao's works, universally establishing small groups for studying Chairman Mao's works, selecting instructors, and implementing study plans. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that went to the first pit used the time before class to lecture workers on Chairman Mao's works and party policies, and during rest time, they studied quotations, shared experiences, and exchanged views with the workers, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team paid special attention to helping the proletarian revolutionaries study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their struggles. The three revolutionary mass organizations in this mine, "Red Workers," "Red Combat Alliance," and "Red Rebel Corps," had the same general direction in their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party; however, they argued endlessly and were unwilling to yield on specific issues, resulting in long-term inability to unite and fight together. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team organized them to study Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" and other related articles, and to learn from the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill in achieving great unity according to administrative departments, helping them improve their understanding of great unity and overcome sectarianism.

On the basis of improving their understanding, they helped the proletarian revolutionaries do a lot of organizational work, achieving revolutionary great unity in the third pit first. Then, they summarized the experience of the third pit and promoted it to the entire mine. After more than ten days of effort, five out of the six pits and three offices in the entire mine achieved unity, creating conditions for further achieving great unity throughout the mine.

Transmitting Experiences in Political and Ideological Work

The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team actively transmitted their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, adhering to the Four Firsts, and thoroughly addressing active thoughts to the revolutionary cadres and workers, which was very welcome. The cadres and workers all said, "The PLA is a good example for us to learn from. We must master the PLA's experience of emphasizing politics." The pit manager of the third pit, Li Lianyu, was serious and responsible in his work, but he did not pay attention to political and ideological work and often criticized and reproached the workers. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team gave him specific help, studying with him how to do political and ideological work and how to educate workers with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the help of the PLA comrades, Li Lianyu began to consciously do political and ideological work. On April 10, an industrial accident occurred in this pit. He did not criticize and reproach others as he used to, but first examined himself, took responsibility, and then organized everyone to find the cause of the accident and learn from it. The problem was handled well, and the workers and section chiefs were satisfied. The cadres and workers of the third pit formulated specific measures to learn from the PLA in doing political and ideological work, quickly applying the good experiences they learned to their actual work. Now, whenever they encounter problems, they consult Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. This pit has a face with poor rock quality, often causing roof falls, seriously affecting production. The revolutionary cadres, technicians, and red rebels, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "no investigation, no right to speak," went out of their offices, conducted thorough investigations on the spot, boldly innovated, and adopted the method of "artificially forcing complete collapse," finally solving the problem from the root. The workers said: This victory is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a result of learning from the PLA.

The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also carried out extensive heart-to-heart talks among the workers and cadres, becoming their confidants. The fourth pit's mechanical and electrical section has more than eighty workers, and more than sixty of them have had heart-to-heart talks and discussions with the propaganda team comrades. Meng Zhaokun said, "The PLA are our confidants. We are willing to tell our confidants what is in our hearts. After exchanging heartfelt words, our hearts feel particularly comfortable, and the more we talk, the clearer our minds become." The deputy pit manager of this pit, Li Zhende, was elected as the leader of the production team and had concerns in his mind, fearing that production would not go well, fearing accidents, and fearing that someone would not listen to the leadership. The propaganda team comrades had four or five heart-to-heart talks with him, reminiscing about the bitterness of the old society with him, arousing his class consciousness, and helping him come up with ideas and solutions. In this way, he dispelled his concerns, worked boldly, worked alongside the team, and took responsibility actively.

Thoroughly Promoting Policy Education to Unite the Majority of Cadres

In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the original mine party committee stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, adopting the reactionary policy of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" on the issue of cadres, inciting those who did not understand the truth to seize the mistakes of cadres and not let go. As a result, out of the 155 cadres above the section level in the entire mine, 48 were suspended for self-reflection, and 56 were struggled against. This bourgeois reactionary line was like a shackle on the broad masses of cadres, making them unable to hold their heads high.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in response to this situation, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy to unite the majority of cadres and isolate and strike at the handful. They assisted the mine area in holding a three-level cadre meeting to study Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The cadres held lively discussions at the meeting, many cadres who had made mistakes exposed their thoughts, checked their mistakes, and expressed their determination to firmly return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to dare to take the lead, and to seriously seize the revolution and promote production. With the help of the propaganda team comrades, various revolutionary mass organizations also held meetings with section-level and above cadres in the offices, studying Chairman Mao's cadre policy together, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line together, giving the attendees a profound education.

In the situation where revolutionary cadres stood out one after another, the propaganda team comrades did in-depth and meticulous ideological work. The specific methods were: first, to investigate and understand the situation of all cadres in the mine, to have a clear understanding; second, for good and relatively good cadres, to actively support and help them, encouraging them to take responsibility boldly in their work; third, for cadres who had made serious mistakes but were not anti-party and anti-socialist elements and insisted on not changing or were incorrigible, to adopt the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and treating the sick to save people," criticizing their mistakes seriously on the one hand, and strengthening ideological education on the other, and letting them go to the masses' struggles to reform themselves.

Deputy Mine Manager Sun Yanhong is a newly promoted young cadre with good feedback from the masses. When the entire mine established the production command department, he was elected as the team leader. At first, he had a sense of difficulty. The propaganda team comrades actively talked to him, encouraging him to work boldly; they also pointed out his shortcomings in work in a timely manner. For example, Sun Yanhong was not good at following the mass line, so the propaganda team comrades studied "Organize" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" with him, helping him improve his ideological understanding. From then on, Sun Yanhong often went deep into the pits, understood the situation, and used every opportunity to talk to the workers and do ideological work, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the cadres and workers, making the production situation of the entire mine better day by day.

Deputy Director of the Political Department Sun Pingjun had served as the head of a work team, executing the bourgeois reactionary line, and during the movement, directed the spearhead at the masses, committing directional errors. After the editorial of the third issue of "Red Flag" was published, he had intense ideological struggles, thinking: I have made such serious mistakes, I have no face to see the masses, and I am not qualified to be a cadre. After the propaganda team comrades arrived, he actively talked about his ideological situation. The propaganda team comrades sincerely criticized and helped him, often talked to him, studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy together, and reminisced about bitterness and sweetness together, helping him quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Sun Pingjun said excitedly, "The bourgeois reactionary line harmed me, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line saved me. I will respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions and make amends in my work." After he stood out, he organized the cadres of the Political Department to go to various pits to participate in labor, cooperate with the PLA to do a good job of propaganda, and help the pits establish the system of studying Chairman Mao's works.

Now, the majority of section-level and above cadres in the entire mine have gone to the front line, commanding production and participating in labor, and the workers generally have good feedback. The broad revolutionary workers and cadres have put the boundless enthusiasm they have shown in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, launching a competition high tide, and the entire mine has presented a new situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production, with everyone pursuing and encouraging each other.

    突出伟大的毛泽东思想　突出无产阶级政治
    解放军支援滴道煤矿大抓革命猛促生产
    促进了革命大联合，团结了干部大多数，调动了职工积极性，煤产量大幅度上升
    编者按：目前，人民解放军的广大干部战士，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，肩负着支援左派广大群众，支援工业，支援农业，军管，军训等项光荣任务。他们深入工厂农村，同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一起，抓革命，促生产，做出了很大的成绩，创造了很多很好的经验。人民解放军某部支援滴道煤矿的事迹，就是一个突出的例子。
    人民解放军是高举毛泽东思想红旗的伟大革命军队。这支人民军队在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导和林彪副统帅的亲自指挥下，在长期的革命斗争中形成了一套完整的政治工作的光荣传统，在活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，大抓狠抓活思想方面，积累了丰富经验。支援滴道煤矿的部队，所以能够帮助矿区的革命职工和革命干部，很好地挑起革命和生产两副重担，就是因为他们一开始就着重从政治上支援无产阶级革命派，大力宣传毛泽东思想，做了大量的深入细致的政治思想工作，从而大大促进了人的思想革命化，激发了矿区广大革命职工和革命干部的革命积极性和冲天干劲。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，还在几年前就号召全国学人民解放军。最近，毛主席又提出拥军爱民的伟大号召。无产阶级革命派在同解放军同志们并肩战斗中，一定要很好地学习解放军的政治思想工作经验，努力活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，进一步加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。我们相信，在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中建立了新的功勋的伟大的人民解放军，一定会得到广大革命群众的热烈拥护；解放军的广大指战员，也一定会加倍爱护人民，和广大革命群众紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    一支很好的毛泽东思想宣传队
    滴道矿是鸡西矿务局最大的一个煤矿。它生产的煤全部供应鞍山钢铁公司。在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派千方百计地破坏革命，破坏生产，使生产班子瘫痪，生产秩序混乱，严重影响了生产任务的完成。
    在这种情况下，人民解放军黑龙江省军区响应毛主席的伟大号召，三月底派出毛泽东思想宣传队，支援鸡西矿区抓革命促生产。宣传队进入滴道矿以后，立即广泛宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，帮助滴道矿迅速恢复了生产秩序，建立了生产班子，革命形势越来越好，煤的产量大幅度上升。
    支援滴道矿的解放军同志，处处突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，是一支很好的毛泽东思想宣传队。他们组成了六个宣传队，深入到各坑口、各科室，帮助恢复和健全“班前学，班中用，班后评”的学习毛主席著作的制度，普遍建立了毛主席著作学习小组，选出了辅导员，落实了学习计划。到一坑去的毛泽东思想宣传队，利用班前的时间给工人讲毛主席著作和党的方针政策，在休息时间和工人一起学语录，谈心得，交流经验，大大地促进了人的思想革命化。
    毛泽东思想宣传队，特别注意帮助无产阶级革命派在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。这个矿的“红工”、“红战联”、“红色造反团”三个革命群众组织，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，大方向是一致的；但是在具体问题上争论不休，互不服气，以致长期以来不能联合作战。毛泽东思想宣传队就组织他们学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和其他有关文章，学习贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门大联合的经验，帮助他们提高了对大联合的认识，克服了小团体主义。
    在提高认识的基础上，他们又帮助无产阶级革命派做了不少组织工作，在三坑首先实现了革命的大联合。接着，他们总结了三坑的经验，向全矿推广，经过十多天的努力，全矿六个坑口就有五个坑口和三个科室实现了联合，为进一步实现全矿大联合准备了条件。
    传授政治思想工作的经验
    毛泽东思想宣传队的同志积极向革命干部和革命工人传授活学活用毛主席著作、坚持四个第一、大抓活思想的经验，很受欢迎。干部和工人们都说：“解放军是我们学习的好榜样，我们一定要把解放军突出政治的经验学到手。”三坑坑长李联玉对工作认真负责，但是，不注意做政治思想工作，对待工人有时批评指责多。毛泽东思想宣传队的同志对他进行了具体的帮助，和他一起研究如何做政治思想工作，怎样用毛泽东思想教育工人。在解放军同志的帮助下，李联玉开始自觉地做政治思想工作。四月十日，这个坑发生了一起工伤事故。他没有象以前那样，只批评指责别人，而是首先检查自己，主动承担责任，然后组织大家找出发生事故的原因，接受教训。问题处理得很好，工人和段长都很满意。三坑的干部和工人制定了向解放军学习做政治思想工作的具体措施，把学到的好经验很快用到实际工作中去。现在他们遇到问题就向毛主席著作请教，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。这个坑有个掌子面的石质不好，经常发生冒顶事故，严重影响生产。革命干部、技术人员和红色造反者遵照毛主席的“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，走出了办公室，深入现场，经过周密的调查，大胆革新，采用了人工“强行全部陷落”的方法，终于从根本上解决了问题。工人们说：这一工作的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利，是大学解放军的结果。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，还在工人、干部中展开了广泛的谈心活动，和他们交知心朋友。四坑机电段有八十多名工人，和宣传队同志谈过心和座谈过的就有六十多人。孟兆坤说：“解放军是我们的知心人，我们愿意把心里话告诉我们的知心人。互相谈了知心话，心情特别舒畅，越谈心里越亮堂。”这个坑的副坑长李振德被选为生产班子的班长，思想上有顾虑，怕生产搞不上去，怕出事故，怕有人不听领导。宣传队的同志和他谈心四五次，和他一起忆旧社会的苦，启发他的阶级觉悟，还帮助他出主意想办法。这样，他就解除了思想顾虑，大胆工作，跟班劳动，积极负责。
    大抓政策教育团结干部大多数
    在无产阶级文化大革命的初期，原矿党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地执行了资产阶级反动路线，在干部问题上采取“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，煽动不明真相的人，抓住干部的某些错误不放。结果，全矿科级以上的一百五十五名干部中，被停职反省的有四十八名，被斗的有五十六名。这一条资产阶级反动路线象枷锁一样套在广大干部身上，使他们抬不起头来。
    毛泽东思想宣传队，针对这种情况，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，为团结大多数干部，孤立和打击一小撮，作了一系列的工作。他们协助矿区召开了三级干部会议，学习了毛主席的干部政策。干部们在会上展开了热烈的讨论，许多犯错误的干部亮了思想，检查了错误，纷纷表示要坚决回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，要敢字当头，认真地抓革命促生产。在宣传队同志的帮助下，各革命群众组织也和机关科级以上的干部开会，一起学习毛主席的干部政策，一起批判资产阶级反动路线，使到会的同志受到了深刻的教育。
    在革命干部纷纷站出来的情况下，宣传队同志又作了深入细致的思想工作。具体作法是：一、调查研究，摸清全矿的干部情况，作到心中有数；二、对好的和比较好的干部，积极支持，认真帮助，鼓励他们在工作中大胆负责；三、对犯有严重错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，一面对他们的错误进行严肃的批判，一面加强思想教育，并且让他们到群众斗争中去改造自己。
    副矿长孙彦风是新提拔起来的年轻干部，群众反映较好。当全矿成立生产指挥部时，他被选为班长。开始他有畏难情绪。宣传队的同志就主动找他谈话，鼓励他大胆工作；对他在工作中的一些缺点，也及时地指出来。比如：孙彦风不善于走群众路线，宣传队的同志就和他一起学习《组织起来》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等文章，帮助他提高思想认识。从此，孙彦风经常深入坑口，了解情况，并利用一切机会和工人谈心，作思想工作，调动了干部和工人的积极性，使全矿的生产形势一天天好转。
    政治处副主任孙平均，担任过工作组长，执行了资产阶级反动路线，在运动中把矛头指向群众，犯了方向性的错误。《红旗》杂志第三期社论发表后，他思想斗争很激烈，心想：我犯了这么严重的错误，没有脸见群众了，也不配当干部了。宣传队的同志来了以后，他主动谈了自己的思想情况。宣传队的同志对他进行了诚恳的批评和帮助，经常找他谈话，一起学习毛主席的干部政策，一起忆苦思甜，使他尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。孙平均激动地说：“资产阶级反动路线害了我，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线救了我。我要用实际行动来响应毛主席的伟大号召，在工作中将功补过。”他站出来后，又组织政治处的干部到各坑口参加劳动，配合解放军搞好宣传，帮助坑口建立学习毛主席著作的制度。
    现在，全矿科级以上的干部，绝大部分走上了第一线，指挥生产，参加劳动，工人普遍反映很好。广大革命职工和革命干部把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产中去，掀起了竞赛高潮，全矿出现了你追我赶的抓革命促生产的新局面。
