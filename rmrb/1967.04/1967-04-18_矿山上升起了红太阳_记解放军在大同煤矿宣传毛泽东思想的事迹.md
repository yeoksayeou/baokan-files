Spring has arrived in the mountains of Shanxi's Yanbei region. The ancient coal mines of Datong are bathed in the brilliant sunshine of early spring.

The Datong mining area, spanning several dozen miles, is a treasure trove of the motherland. Known as the "coal sea," every mountain here is rich with high-quality coal deposits reaching depths of over a hundred meters. Here, tens of thousands of hardworking and brave coal miners work tirelessly, sending out tens of thousands of tons of coal daily to every corner of the motherland, bringing light and warmth to the people...

It is here that a fierce class struggle has been raging. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have attempted to change the color of this socialist mine. They have used various vile methods to deceive and corrupt the workers. At the beginning of this year, they engaged in counter-revolutionary economism, inciting workers to fight each other, disrupting labor discipline, and sabotaging production.

At this critical moment, a contingent of People's Liberation Army soldiers arrived at the mine. With Chairman Mao's portrait on their chests, holding quotation books, and singing quotation songs, they traversed every corner of the mine.

The soldiers saw that in this modernized mine, almost everything was available: advanced machinery, tall factory buildings, abundant resources, and more. To change the face of the mine, the most important thing was to bring Mao Zedong Thought to the workers, letting the radiant sun of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the entire mining area.

Breaking the "Forbidden Zone"

With Chairman Mao's teachings in their hearts, the soldiers donned miner's clothes, put on miner's lamps, and descended into the mine shafts, hundreds of meters below the surface.

The mine shaft is the frontline of coal production. Tens of thousands of workers in the Datong coal mine toil day and night in this vast "underground factory," engaging in the most arduous and relentless struggle against nature.

In the past, some people in the Datong coal mine referred to the shaft as a "forbidden zone," meaning that only production was allowed here, and politics could not enter. Of course, this was a lie. Within the mine, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power feared only Mao Zedong Thought. Ideas like material incentives, "bonus as the commander," and "mechanization solves everything" freely spread here. Now, the soldiers, carrying Mao Zedong Thought, have broken into this "forbidden zone."

On March 16, Platoon Leader Tao Genyuan and Squad Leader Yuan Yunchen, along with a few soldiers, arrived at the Tongjialing Mine's Coal Mining Team 5. This was a highly mechanized coal mining team, equipped with the best combined coal mining machines in the country. However, for a long time, high mechanization had not brought high production. Why? Some said it was due to machinery accidents, others blamed the poor roof conditions of the working face. They blamed everything but the people.

That day, before descending into the mine, the soldiers spent some time studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work" with the workers. Then, they sang quotation songs and, with renewed spirit, went down into the mine.

The intense battle began. The combined coal mining machine roared, and the coal chute carried coal out like a river. When people got tired, they heard the soldiers loudly reciting, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." After one shift, Squad Leader Yuan Yunchen joined the second shift, working from noon to midnight.

Unfortunately, the machine malfunctioned midway, and it could no longer be used. What to do? According to past practices here, people could only wait for the machine to be fixed. Once the machine stopped, production had to stop as well. At this moment, Squad Leader Yuan Yunchen shouted to the workers, "Comrades, human factors are the most important. The machine has stopped, but we cannot let production stop!"

"Right, Chairman Mao calls on us to seize the revolution and promote production. We cannot just stare at the machine," the workers replied.

Immediately, people switched to the method of drilling and blasting. Soon, the sound of wind drills drilling and the roar of blasting echoed through the mine. The coal-laden chute flowed again, carrying coal out.

On that day, this coal mining team, which had the best machinery but had long struggled with production, created a record of 540 tons per day, proving a truth: politics first, human factors first.

The Brightest "Miner's Lamp"

The soldiers from the Third Company worked alongside the workers in the Coal Valley Mine. At the working face, each soldier worked like a little tiger. Some swung heavy hammers to drive supports, others shoveled coal with iron shovels. After finishing their section, they rushed to help others, seemingly unaware of fatigue. All of this was seen by a young worker, who was deeply moved. During a break, he asked a soldier:

"Why are you coming down to the mine to dig coal?"

"We are responding to Chairman Mao's call to help worker comrades seize the revolution and promote production."

"How much money do you earn in a month?"

"Money?" the soldier replied, "We are not here to dig coal for money. We are here for the revolution, for the country not to change color."

This answer deeply moved the young worker.

In recent years, the workers of the Datong coal mine had often heard a different kind of voice: "As long as the chute turns, there will be food and clothes," "Work for money, the more you work, the more you get, the less you work, the less you get," and so on. Money, money, it rang in their ears all day. Many workers found it annoying, but some fell into the capitalist trap, their hearts tied to money. Of course, this revisionist trick did not make the mine "thrive." The more money, the more chaotic the hearts, and the worse the production.

Now, looking at these young soldiers in front of them, who did not work for money or fame, but wholeheartedly for the revolution, listening to Chairman Mao's words, working so happily in the mine. Watching these young men, the workers couldn't help but shed tears of joy. A worker, deeply moved, said, "In the past, some of us only relied on the miner's lamp on our heads to walk. It could only illuminate a small area under our eyelids. Now, the PLA comrades have brought us Mao Zedong Thought. It is a million times brighter than the miner's lamp, illuminating the entire mine."

Never Leave the Battle Station

The coal mine is a massive machine with dozens of trades and hundreds of positions. Only when all "parts" are tightly fastened can the machine roar to life. Recently, some schemers incited workers to leave their production posts, attempting to stop this machine.

The PLA soldiers, who had undergone strict revolutionary discipline training, and the old workers quickly saw through these plots.

One night, the northwest wind howled non-stop. The coal selection building was brightly lit, and a shift of coal selection workers were working hard. The cold numbed the workers' hands and feet. "Why hasn't the heat been turned on yet?" a worker called the heating room. Unexpectedly, the other end said, "Is it cold there? It's warm here, come over." The worker who made the call angrily hung up the phone and said, "No heat and still making jokes!" Everyone heard this and got angry, "Who is this person? Let's go and rebel against him!" Many people put down their work and stormed out in anger.

Just at this moment, soldier Wang Linzhou came over. Seeing the situation, he quickly ran up and asked, "Comrades, what's happening? Why have you stopped working?" A worker told the soldier what had just happened. The soldier said, "Not providing heat is their negligence, but such a response is even more wrong. But comrades, think about it, if we stop working to rebel, does it meet Chairman Mao's call to 'seize the revolution and promote production'?" The workers heard Chairman Mao's words and immediately stopped. Someone said, "Right, this does not meet the spirit of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production.' But it's quite cold, what should we do?"

The soldier saw that everyone had calmed down and continued to persuade them. He said, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao tells us to seize the revolution and promote production. We must resolutely carry out his instructions, no matter how great the difficulties, we must not waver." He told them the story of Luo Shengtao, who in the bitter cold winter, jumped into an ice pit to save a Korean child. He also told the story of Qiu Shaoyun, who remained loyal to his duty and died heroically in a fire. He said, "Cold? It's not as cold as jumping into an ice pit; hot? It's not as hot as being in a fire. But why did Luo Shengtao and Qiu Shaoyun not retreat when facing ice pits and fires? It's because they had a firm belief in being loyal to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people. With this belief, they would fear neither cold nor heat, nor anything else! 'Comrades, you're cold, I have a coat here. Whoever's clothes are thin, please wear it.' The soldier said, taking off his coat. The workers did not take it, looking at the young soldier with respectful eyes, their hearts warm, and they said in unison, 'Right! We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, 'seize the revolution and promote production,' and we must not arbitrarily leave our production posts. Let's go to work, we'll raise the issue of heating after the shift.'"

What is in line with Mao Zedong Thought must be carried out

One day, the Third Coal Mining Team was working in the mine when a dispute arose: young worker Yao Ding argued with the team leader. The team leader assigned Yao Ding to shovel coal (a more tiring job), and Yao Ding refused, leading to an argument.

Later, the team leader left, and the dispute ended.

This dispute, however, caught the attention of the Five Good Soldier, Tian Yongsheng, who was nearby. He thought this was not an ordinary dispute; it reflected a principle issue, and he could not stand idly by. So, he went to the young man and said seriously and sincerely:

"Yao Ding, your attitude towards the team leader just now was wrong. Towards revolutionary leaders, we should obey orders and follow commands. If everyone is like you, how can the leaders complete the tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the people?"

The young man also knew he was wrong and mumbled, "I was wrong, I shouldn't have argued with him." Saying this, he picked up the iron shovel and went to work.

The soldier could see that although the young man admitted his mistake, he had not yet understood the issue in his mind. After work, he went to the worker's dormitory. Yao Ding was mending his pants, and Tian Yongsheng took the needle and thread from him and helped him mend it, chatting as they worked. Tian Yongsheng then learned that Yao Ding had just finished a shift, worked the middle shift for only four and a half hours, and then came to work the day shift without rest, so he did not want to operate the shovel coal machine.

Tian Yongsheng then took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied with Yao Ding. Chairman Mao said, "We must unite all the forces of our Party under the principles of democratic centralism and strict discipline." After discussing for a while, Yao Ding's understanding improved. Tian Yongsheng then said to him, "We are not arguing with someone just because they are a leader. The main thing is to see if their actions align with Mao Zedong Thought. If they do not align with Mao Zedong Thought, we must rebel. If they do align with Mao Zedong Thought, we must support and resolutely carry out their instructions."

Yao Ding was originally a good worker. After Tian Yongsheng's help, he correctly resolved the issue of how to treat leaders, his mood became more cheerful, and his work more enthusiastic.

The PLA soldiers and the workers of the Datong coal mine have, in these days, united closely under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, learning from each other, helping each other, and growing together. This is a historic meeting, which will foster a truly revolutionary proletarian coal mining industry army for the Datong coal mine.

    矿山上升起了红太阳
    ——记解放军在大同煤矿宣传毛泽东思想的事迹
    春天已经来到了山西雁北丛山。古老的大同煤矿到处是一片阳光灿烂的初春景色。
    方圆几十里的大同矿区是祖国的一块宝地。这里被人们称为“煤海”，每一座山下都埋藏着厚达上百米的优质“乌金”。这里有着几万以勤劳勇敢著称的煤矿工人，他们每天从井下送出成万吨的煤炭，输送到祖国的四面八方，给人们带来光和热……
    就是在这里，一场激烈的阶级斗争始终在进行着。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图使这座社会主义矿山改变颜色，他们使用了各种恶劣的手段，蒙骗工人，腐蚀工人队伍。在今年年初，他们大搞反革命经济主义，挑动群众斗群众，破坏劳动纪律，破坏生产。
    就在这紧要时刻，一支人民子弟兵来到了矿山，他们胸挂毛主席像，手举语录牌，高唱着语录歌，走遍了矿山的各个角落。
    战士们看到，在这个近代化矿山里几乎什么也不缺少：有新式的机械设备，有高大的厂房，有富饶的资源，……。要改变矿山的面貌，最最重要的，就是要把毛泽东思想带给工人兄弟们，让毛泽东思想这个光芒万丈的太阳，普照整个矿区。
    打破“禁区”
    战士们胸怀着毛主席的教导，穿上矿工服，戴上矿灯，走下了离地面几百米的矿井。
    井下是煤矿生产的第一线。大同煤矿的几万工人在这个庞大的“地下工厂”里，不分昼夜地与自然界进行着最艰苦而顽强的搏斗。
    井下，过去在大同煤矿被一些人称为“禁区”，意思是说，在这里只是搞生产，政治是进不来的。当然，这是骗人的鬼话。矿内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派害怕的只是毛泽东思想，什么物质刺激呀，“奖金挂帅”呀，“有了机械化就有了一切”呀等资产阶级思想却在这里自由泛滥。现在，战士们带着毛泽东思想，闯进了这个“禁区”。
    三月十六日，连长陶根元、排长袁云成带着几个战士，来到了同家梁矿采煤五队。这是一个高度机械化的采煤队，装备着全国最好的联合采煤机，可是长期以来，高度机械化并没有给他们带来生产的高产。什么原因呢？有人说这是机械事故造成的，有人说这得怪工作面的顶板不好，怪来怪去，就是不从“人”上去找原因。
    这天，战士们在下井前的一段时间，先和工人们一起学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”等教导，接着就高唱着语录歌，精神焕发地到了井下。
    紧张的战斗开始了。联合采煤机轧轧地响，煤溜子象流水似地往外运煤。人们干累了，就听见战士们在高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一班干完，排长袁云成跟着第二班又投入了战斗，从中午十二点干到深夜。
    不巧，机器中途发生了故障，不能再用。怎么办？按照这里过去的惯例，人是只能听候机器摆布的，机器一停，生产也只能停下来。此刻，排长袁云成对工人们喊：“同志们，人的因素第一，机器停了，我们不能让生产停下来！”
    “对，毛主席号召咱们抓革命促生产，不能大眼瞪小眼，光瞧着机器。”工人们回答。
    于是，人们立即改用了打眼放炮的办法，一会儿，井下响起了风钻的打眼声，隆隆的放炮声，满载煤块的溜子重新又哗哗地流动起来。
    就在这一天，这个有着最好的机器而生产长期上不去的采煤队，创造了一个日产五百四十吨的空前纪录，它向人们证明了一个真理：政治第一，人的因素第一。
    最明亮的“矿灯”
    三连的战士跟着工人们到煤峪口矿井下劳动。到了工作面，战士们个个象小老虎似的干开了，有的抡起大铁锤打柱子，有的抄起铁锨装煤，自己的一段干完了，就赶去帮助别人，仿佛压根儿不知道累似的。这一切，都被一个青年工人看在眼里，战士们所做的一切使他感动。休息的时候，他问一位战士：
    “你们干么下井来挖煤呀？”
    “我们是响应毛主席的号召，来帮助工人同志抓革命，促生产。”
    “你们一个月挣几块钱呀？”
    “钱？”战士听了说：“我们不是为了挣钱来采煤的，我们是为了革命，为了国家不变颜色。”
    这个回答，使青年工人十分感动。
    这些年来，大同煤矿的工人们耳朵里经常听到的，是完全不同的另一种声音：“只要溜子转，有了吃也有了穿”，“干活有钱，多干多给，少干少给”，……钱，钱，整天在耳边响，许多工人听了十分厌烦，但也有一些人上了资产阶级的圈套，心被拴在钱眼上了。当然，修正主义的这一套没有把矿山“刺激”得兴旺起来，钱越多，人心越乱，生产也越糟。
    现在，工人们看着眼前的这些青年战士，一不为钱，二不为名，一心为革命，一心听毛主席的话，在井下干得那么欢。看着这些小伙子，工人们禁不住高兴得流泪。一个工人深有所感地说：“过去，我们有些人就只靠头上的这只矿灯走道，它只能照到眼皮下的一点儿。如今解放军同志给我们带来了毛泽东思想，它比矿灯亮一万倍，把井下全照亮了。”
    一刻不离战斗岗位
    煤矿是一部庞大的机器，有几十种工种，上百个岗位。只有所有“部件”全部拧紧了，机器才能隆隆地转动起来。前些日子，一些别有用心的家伙，却煽动工人离开生产岗位，企图让这部机器停止转动。
    受过严格革命纪律锻炼的解放军战士和老工人们，及时地识破了这些阴谋。
    一天夜里，西北风呼呼地刮个不停，选煤楼里灯火通明，一班选煤工人在紧张劳动，严寒把工人们的手脚冻得发麻。“为什么还不给送暖气呢？”一个工人给暖气房打了电话。出乎意料，对方竟然说：“你们那里冷吗？我们这里可暖和了，你们上这儿来吧。”打电话的工人生气地把电话放下了，发火地说：“不给送暖气，还说风凉话！”大家听了也都火了，“这是个什么人？造他的反去！”好多人放下生产，气呼呼地要走。
    正在这时候，战士王林洲走来，看见这个情况，赶紧跑上前去问：“同志们，怎么回事，为什么放下生产走了？”一位工人把刚才发生的事告诉了战士。战士说：“不送暖气是他们失职，那样答复更加错误。可是同志们要想一想，我们放下生产去造反，符合毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的要求吗？”工人听到了毛主席的话，脚步立即停了下来。有人说：“对呀，这样做不符合‘抓革命，促生产’的精神。可是又挺冷，该怎么办呢？”
    战士看到大家已经冷静下来了，就进一步说服大家。他说：“我们要听毛主席的话，毛主席叫我们抓革命，促生产，我们就要坚决照办，不管有多大困难，绝对不应有丝毫动摇。”他给大家讲了罗盛教在严寒刺骨的冬天，下冰窟舍己救朝鲜小孩的故事。又讲了邱少云在大火弥漫的草丛里忠于职守壮烈牺牲的英雄事迹。他说：冷吗？冷不过下冰窟；热吗？热不过大火烧身。可是罗盛教、邱少云为什么下冰窟、闯火海毫不退缩呢？就是因为他们树立了坚定的忠于毛主席、忠于党、忠于人民的思想。有了这种思想，就会冷不怕，热不怕，什么也不怕！“同志们，你们冷，我这里有一件大衣，谁的衣服单薄，请穿上吧。”战士说着，就脱下身上的大衣。工人们谁也没有去接，大家用敬佩的目光看着年青的战士，心上热呼呼的，禁不住异口同声地说：“对！咱们要按毛主席的指示办事，‘抓革命，促生产’，绝不能随便离开生产岗位，走，生产去，暖气的事下班后再去提意见。”
    符合毛泽东思想的就要执行
    一天，第三采煤队在井下劳动的时候，发生了一场纠纷：青年工人姚铎和队长吵了起来。队长分配姚铎去攉煤（这是一种比较累的活），姚铎不想干拒绝了，两个人就吵开了。
    后来，队长走开了，一场纠纷也就不了了之。
    这场争吵却引起了边上的五好战士田永生的注意。他想，这不是一场普通的争吵，这场争吵反映了一个原则问题，我不能袖手旁观。于是，他走到了青年人跟前，严肃而诚恳地说：
    “姚铎，刚才你对待队长的态度很不对，对革命的领导干部，我们应当服从命令听指挥，如果大家都象你这样，领导干部又怎样去完成党和人民委托给他们的任务呢？”
    青年人也知道自己理亏，低声嘟囔了一句：“是我不对，我不该和他吵。”说罢，就拿起铁锨干活去了。
    战士看得出来，青年人虽然承认了自己不对，但对这个问题还没有从思想上认识清楚。下班以后，他又来到了工人宿舍。姚铎正在补裤子，田永生就接过他手里的针线，帮他补起来，边做活边谈心。田永生这才了解到，原来这天姚铎刚刚倒班，上完中班只休息了四个多小时，又来上白班，没有休息好，所以不愿意开攉煤机。
    田永生便拿出《毛主席语录》，和姚铎一起学习起来。毛主席说：“我们要把我们党的一切力量在民主集中制的组织和纪律的原则之下，坚强地团结起来。”两人议论了一会，姚铎的认识有了些提高。田永生又对他说：“我们不是因为谁是领导，就不该和他争吵，主要是看他办事符合不符合毛泽东思想。不符合毛泽东思想的，我们就要造反，符合毛泽东思想的，我们就要拥护，就要坚决执行。”
    姚铎本来是个好工人，经过田永生的帮助，正确解决了如何对待领导干部的问题，他的心情更舒畅了，劳动也更起劲了。
    解放军战士和大同煤矿的工人们，在这些日子里，就这样在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，紧紧地结合在一起，互相学习，互相帮助，共同成长。这是一个具有历史意义的会合，它将为大同煤矿造就出一支真正革命化的无产阶级的煤矿产业大军。
