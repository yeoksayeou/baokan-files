"Cultivation of the Self" is a poisonous weed. It brazenly opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It peddles the black goods of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism. It advocates the reactionary philosophy of the exploiting class, "If you do not seek personal gain, heaven and earth will punish you." It subtly promotes individualism. It justifies the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and prepares public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In short, it is the general line for the number one capitalist-roader in the Party to seize the Party, the army, and the government, and to change the color of our country. It is the great enemy of the Communist Party, the great enemy of the people, and the great enemy of the international communist movement. With the enemy in front of us, we must thoroughly overthrow and expose it.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call and thoroughly overthrow and expose the extremely reactionary "Cultivation of the Self" politically, ideologically, and theoretically! The whole Party must unite to exterminate it, and the whole nation must unite to condemn it! We will not rest until we bury it along with the capitalist reactionary line!

At present, the great proletarian cultural revolution is sweeping away the capitalist reactionary line with the momentum of "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat." At this time, our criticism of "Cultivation of the Self" becomes an important part of thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line and a combat mission to repel the capitalist restoration tide. Only by thoroughly criticizing it can we eliminate the soil for revisionism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, implement the proletarian revolutionary line, achieve victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution, and resolutely defend our lifeline—the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Criticizing "Cultivation of the Self" is a serious class struggle, a life-and-death struggle between two ideologies, two classes, and two lines. It is a major issue concerning the future and destiny of the Party and the state. It is the most important political issue at present. We must not take it lightly!

Criticizing "Cultivation of the Self" is a profound ideological revolution. We must overthrow the old to establish the new. To firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly criticize the "Cultivation of the Self" of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. Because the "self" that permeates the book is fundamentally opposed to the communist worldview of serving the public with all one's heart. We must develop a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, eliminate bourgeois ideology, and establish proletarian ideology. We must carry out a revolution in our souls, dare to break with all old ideas, and cleanse the remnants of "Cultivation of the Self" from our minds.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." We believe that the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will thoroughly criticize the reactionary ideas of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, promote the victory of the cultural revolution, and drive the wheel of history forward rapidly. In this struggle, we will also raise our consciousness, increase our skills, and promote the revolutionization of our thinking.

    把反动透顶的《修养》批倒，批臭！
    北京大学　《新北大》编辑部
    《修养》是株大毒草。
    它猖狂地反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。它大肆贩卖资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的黑货。它鼓吹“人不为己，天诛地灭”的剥削阶级反动哲学。它转弯抹角地宣扬个人主义。它为地富反坏右分子张目，为复辟资本主义制造舆论准备。总之，它是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派企图篡党、篡军、篡政，使我国改变颜色的总纲领。它是共产党的大敌，是人民的大敌，是国际共产主义运动的大敌。大敌当前，我们必须彻底把它打倒。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，把反动透顶的《修养》，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批倒、批臭！全党共诛之，全国共讨之！不把它连同资产阶级反动路线彻底埋葬，我们誓不罢休！
  目前，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，正以“横扫千军如卷席”之势，直捣资产阶级反动路线的老巢。在这个时候，我们批判《修养》，就成为彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的重要内容，就成为打退资本主义复辟逆流的战斗任务。只有彻底批判它，才能铲除修正主义的土壤，才能巩固无产阶级专政，才能贯彻无产阶级革命路线，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，才能坚决地捍卫我们的命根子——伟大的毛泽东思想。
    批判《修养》，这是一场严肃的阶级斗争，是两种思想、两个阶级、两条路线之间你死我活的斗争。这是关系到党和国家前途与命运的大事，这是当前最大的政治，我们切不可等闲视之！
    批判《修养》，这是一场深刻的思想大革命。不破不立。我们要大立毛泽东思想，就必须大破资产阶级思想，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》。因为，书中贯穿的“私”字，是和一心为公的共产主义世界观根本对立的。我们要发扬高度的革命自觉性，灭资兴无，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，敢于同一切旧思想决裂，把头脑中《修养》的余毒打扫个干干净净。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”我们相信，亿万革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反动思想，必将促进文化大革命胜利发展，推动历史车轮的迅猛前进。在这场斗争中，我们也必将提高觉悟，增长才干，促进思想革命化。
