Bravely engage in the battle to criticize "Self-Cultivation."

The Shanghai Red Guards' Battle Report Editorial Department

The "Self-Cultivation" written by China's Khrushchev, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, is a poisonous weed against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is the theoretical foundation of the capitalist reactionary line and a typical work of revisionism.

In this book, under the banner of studying Marxism-Leninism and cultivating Party spirit, he vigorously spreads bourgeois ideas of fame and profit. Using the bait of "shouldering great responsibilities," "being like Yao and Shun," and becoming "politically strong revolutionaries," he wants advanced warriors of the proletariat to "cultivate" themselves into bourgeois politicians who seek fame and profit.

In this book, he actively advocates the Confucian way of cultivation, urging communist revolutionaries to learn from the feudal ancestors Confucius and Mencius, to "strengthen their will" and "stir their hearts and endure hardship." This is to put a feudal spiritual shackle on the necks of the vast majority of Communist Party members.

In this book, he actively promotes the ideas of "tolerance," "forbearance," and "bending over backwards to accommodate others," castrating the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and attempting to cultivate slaves of revisionism within the proletarian ranks.

In this book, he vigorously denies class struggle, obscures the class nature of intra-party struggle, and says that intra-party struggle is merely due to "different ways of looking at problems." He advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle and peddles Khrushchev-style "abolition of struggle" and "party peace" junk.

In this book, he repeatedly emphasizes that only those with "high cultivation" can determine the most beneficial policies and strategies for the proletarian revolutionary cause in "complex situations," "rapid changes," and "circuitous and winding paths." This is completely a cover-up for traitors who have betrayed their cause.

In this book, under the pretext of opposing the "search for targets of struggle" and treating comrades as "straw men" in intra-party struggles, he pleads the case for right-opportunism, seeking rehabilitation and exoneration.

Even more despicable is that in this book, he viciously attacks our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, accusing our great leader of being a "representative of dogmatism," issuing orders in a "paternalistic" manner within the Party, and appearing in the Party as if he were Marx and Lenin. This account we must settle!

This book, which is a combination of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, has been long promoted as a "bible" for the broad masses of Party members. It has also been listed as a compulsory reading text for the broad masses of young people in schools, spreading widely and causing deep harm. Unless this poisonous weed is completely uprooted and its poison thoroughly purged, it will be impossible to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, to uproot the roots of revisionist thought, and to thoroughly complete the glorious task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, the supreme commander.

We, the Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao, guided by Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have played a vanguard role in the previous stage of the revolution, braving dangers and surmounting difficulties, and have made immortal contributions. Today, in the face of the nationwide capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration from top to bottom, we should also play a vanguard role in criticizing this revisionist work, "Self-Cultivation."

Let us wield the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and bravely engage in the battle to thoroughly criticize the revisionist work, "Self-Cultivation"!

    勇敢地投入批判《修养》的战斗
    上海《红卫战报》编辑部
    中国的赫鲁晓夫、党内头号走资本主义道路当权派写的《修养》，是一株反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草，是资产阶级反动路线的理论基础，是一部典型的修正主义代表作。
    在这本书里，他打着学习马列主义，进行党性修养的旗号，极力散布资产阶级的名利思想，以担负“大任”、可为“尧舜”、成为“政治坚强的革命家”为钓饵，要无产阶级先进战士“修养”成沽名钓誉的资产阶级政客。
    在这本书里，他积极提倡孔孟修养之道，要共产主义革命战士去向封建主义的祖师爷孔孟学习，象他们那样去“苦其心志”，去“动心忍性”，就是要在广大共产党员的头颈上套上一副封建主义的精神枷锁。
    在这本书里，他积极鼓吹什么“宽大”、“容忍”、“委曲求全”，阉割无产阶级的革命造反精神，企图把无产阶级队伍中的战士培养成修正主义的奴才。
    在这本书里，他极力否认阶级斗争，抹杀党内斗争的阶级实质，把党内斗争说成只是“看问题方法不同”所引起的。鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，贩卖赫鲁晓夫式的“取消斗争”、“党内和平”的破烂货。
    在这本书里，他一味强调什么只有“高度修养”的人，才能在“情况复杂”、“变化剧烈”、“需要走迂回曲折道路”的时候，能够确定对无产阶级革命事业“最有利的”方针政策，最能“忍辱负重”。这完全是为变节投敌的叛徒涂脂抹粉。
    在这本书里，他借反对什么“‘搜索’斗争对象”，把同志“作为党内斗争中射击的‘草人’”，为右倾机会主义喊冤叫屈，翻案平反。
    更可恶的是，就是在这本书里，他含沙射影地恶毒攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，诬蔑我们的伟大领袖是“教条主义代表人”“家长式的在党内发号施令”“装作马克思、列宁的姿态在党内出现”。这笔账我们一定要清算！
    就是这本封建主义、资本主义、修正主义“三位一体”的破烂，他长期来却要广大党员把它当作“圣经”来看待，在学校里也被列为广大青少年的必读课本，真是流行极广，毒害极深。不彻底铲除这株大毒草，不彻底肃清它的流毒，就不能大灭资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，就不能拔掉修正主义思想的根子，就不能彻底完成最高统帅毛主席交给我们的无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务！
    我们，毛主席的红小兵，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，在前一阶段的革命中，战险风，顶恶浪，起了急先锋的作用，立下了不朽的功勋。今天，在自上而下全国性的资本主义反革命复辟的逆流中，来批判这本修正主义代表作《修养》的时候，也应该起到急先锋的作用。
    让我们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，勇敢地投入战斗，彻底批判《修养》这本修正主义的代表作吧！
