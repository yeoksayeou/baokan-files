	The Argentine "Uncompromising News," an organ of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, recently published an article stating that the proletarian party, united front, and armed struggle are the three major weapons for the Argentine people to achieve revolutionary victory.

	The article exposed the crimes of the Argentine dictatorship in suppressing and exploiting the working people and handing over the country's resources to American monopolists. It said: "The Argentine people need to struggle. To struggle, they need a leadership that guides them in their struggle and leads them to victory."

	The article further pointed out that to organize and mobilize the working class, it is necessary to expose and oppose the revisionists who obstruct the working class's struggle. The article stated that the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization must "unify the indignation of the Argentine people against the pro-American dictatorship of Onganía into a unified revolutionary will," oppose the revisionists' path of compromise, and point out the "path of struggle, combat, and victory."

	The article emphasized that the proletarian party, united front, and armed struggle are the three weapons for relieving the suffering of the Argentine people, achieving happiness, overthrowing the oligarchy and imperialism, and realizing the people's democratic revolution.

	The article also condemned the U.S. imperialists' attempt to establish a "Pan-American Peace Force" through the Argentine dictatorship to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American people. The article said: "The U.S. imperialists are preparing to use Argentine soldiers as cannon fodder to oppose the people of Latin American countries who have already launched armed struggles, the people who will launch armed struggles in the future, and the heroic people of Vietnam. We must prepare for armed struggle to oppose the oligarchy and imperialism that oppress our people, thereby aiding the people of Latin America and the people of all countries in the world to eliminate our common enemy."

    阿根廷《不妥协报》指出人民革命斗争的正确道路
    无产阶级政党统一战线武装斗争是人民取得革命胜利的三大武器
    新华社一日讯　阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》最近发表文章指出，无产阶级政党、统一战线和武装斗争是阿根廷人民取得革命胜利的三大武器。
    文章揭露了阿根廷独裁政府镇压和剥削劳动人民、把国家资源奉送给美国垄断资本家的罪行后说：“阿根廷人民需要斗争，要斗争，就需要有一个引导他们斗争和取得胜利的领导。”
    文章还指出，为了组织和动员工人阶级，应该揭发和反对阻挠工人阶级开展斗争的修正主义分子。文章指出，阿根廷共产主义先锋组织要“把阿根廷人民反对翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权的愤慨情绪凝结成统一的革命意志”，反对修正主义者的妥协道路，指出“斗争、战斗和胜利的道路”。
    文章强调说，无产阶级政党、统一战线和武装斗争，是解除阿根廷人民的痛苦、取得幸福，从而打倒寡头势力和帝国主义，实现人民民主革命的三个武器。
    这篇文章还谴责美帝国主义企图通过阿根廷独裁当局建立镇压拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的“泛美和平部队”。文章说：“美帝国主义准备利用阿根廷士兵作为炮灰，反对已经开展武装斗争的拉丁美洲国家人民，反对今后将开展武装斗争的人民和反对英雄的越南人民。我们应该准备开展武装斗争，反对压迫我国人民的寡头势力和帝国主义，从而援助拉丁美洲人民和世界各国人民消灭我们的共同敌人。”
