The military unit of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in collaboration with local authorities to manage industry, joined forces with the revolutionary masses of the First Thermal Power Plant of Taiyuan. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoted revolution, and vigorously promoted production. This transformed the spiritual outlook of all the workers in the factory, making production flourish. They created the highest equipment capacity since the plant began operations in 1955. In February, after seizing power, compared to the same period last year, the total output value increased by 28%, the electricity generation increased by 39%, and the heating supply increased by 11.86%. Despite the equipment operating at 5.2% over capacity, the coal consumption and factory electricity usage economic indicators also met the national plan requirements, and safety was ensured without accidents.

The military collaborating with local authorities to manage industry must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly support the broad leftist masses, prioritize revolution, establish a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in class struggle, and fully unleash the power of the "three-in-one combination."

For many years, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the First Thermal Power Plant of Taiyuan had been recruiting and appeasing, forming factions, and vigorously promoting revisionism, leading the socialist enterprise astray. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have stubbornly adhered to the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, inciting workers to fight among themselves, engaging in economism, and misleading some deceived workers to leave their posts, putting the entire factory's production in jeopardy. The broad masses of workers were extremely indignant about their actions and rose up to rebel against them and seize their power. Just at the critical moment of the power seizure struggle, the military unit of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses, came to this factory.

Before the military arrived at the factory, the mass organizations "Red Alliance" and "East Wind" had already seized power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. Another organization called the "Red Guard Brigade" was attempting a counter-seizure of power. The struggle between the two factions was extremely intense, and both urgently sought the military's support. Which faction should be supported? The incoming troops, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "without investigation, there is no right to speak," conducted in-depth investigations in the workshops, teams, and groups, studying Chairman Mao's quotations with workers and cadres, holding discussions, having one-on-one talks, and listening to opinions from all sides. They followed the "five examines": first, examining how the organization was formed; second, examining who fought the most bravely, decisively, and thoroughly against the capitalist-roaders in power; third, examining who listened to Chairman Mao's words and consistently adhered to the principles of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty and revolutionary"; fourth, examining who was discriminated against and struck by the capitalist-roaders in power; fifth, examining who could unite the majority of the masses and achieve great unity. Through investigation and research, conducting class analysis, they affirmed that the "Red Alliance" and "East Wind" were revolutionary organizations and resolutely supported their revolutionary actions.

Chairman Mao said, "The enemy will not perish of its own accord." The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party immediately launched a fierce counterattack. They rallied the dregs of society, using conservative organizations to spread poisonous winds and ignite evil fires, distorting right and wrong, spreading rumors, and even assaulting revolutionary workers, directly targeting the great People's Liberation Army. The stationed troops and revolutionary masses resolutely suppressed the arrogance of the counterrevolutionaries, arresting the criminals. For the deceived masses, they repeatedly explained the party's policies, awakening their class consciousness, making them draw a clear line with the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power. At a full factory meeting of workers, the deceived masses, with living facts, exposed and denounced the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power. Within three days, the vast majority of the deceived workers withdrew from the conservative organizations. Many of them, tightly grasping the hands of the military comrades, excitedly said, "The military has brought us back to the right path. In the future, we will definitely learn from the military and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life."

The tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution severely tested the cadre team, proving that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. However, among the revolutionary masses, some comrades had incorrect understandings regarding cadre issues: first, fearing that cadres would come out and regain power, retaliating and striking back; second, fearing that supporting revolutionary cadres to come out would be attacked as "royalists." Among the cadres, there were also "three fears": fearing not being able to distinguish who is a revolutionary, joining the wrong side; fearing that coming out would not be trusted by the masses; fearing that the masses would say they came out for "political opportunism." Facing these incorrect thoughts, the stationed troops organized the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre policies and relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine. Based on improved understanding, the revolutionary masses actively worked with revolutionary cadres, welcoming them to come out and revolutionize together. For some erring cadres, following the principle of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity—criticism—unity," they actively approached them, helping them recognize and correct their mistakes, putting down their burdens, and moving forward lightly. Under the patient help of the military and revolutionary masses, many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel came out. Some erring cadres also returned to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Thus, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" of this factory was formed in the midst of class struggle. The entire factory established a temporary power organ, the Revolutionary Committee, composed of revolutionary cadres (leadership cadres, general cadres, technical personnel), worker representatives (old workers, young workers), and military representatives. In the production teams, "three-in-one combination" service groups were also established, composed of worker representatives, militia representatives, and technical personnel. The broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "organizational tasks must serve political tasks," have already achieved great unity from the bottom up by department and team.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" demonstrated immense vitality. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the proletarian revolutionary masses established revolutionary authority, suppressed the arrogance of the counterrevolutionaries, consolidated and expanded the achievements of the power seizure struggle. Currently, they are advancing victoriously, accomplishing the tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms.

The military collaborating with local authorities to manage industry must pass on the good experience of the military adhering to the "four firsts" and promoting the "three-eight work style" to the factory, emphasizing politics, fully unleashing the positive factors of people, thoroughly breaking the old rules and regulations that shackle the development of productive forces, and establishing a new order for socialist production.

Chairman Mao said, "Politics is the commander, the soul. 'Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.' 'Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created.'"

For a long time, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within this factory opposed Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on promoting revisionist things, spreading the idea that "once the indicators and tasks are completed, the god of wealth will come," and "technology is the hardest thing," suppressing the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the worker masses, shackling the development of productive forces, and leading the enterprise astray to the capitalist path. The worker masses were very indignant, saying, "This small clique is material incentive, treating people with institutions. Without ideological revolutionization, only institutional chaos is increased."

After the military and proletarian revolutionary masses seized power, they resolutely supported the revolutionary masses in launching a fierce attack on capitalist and revisionist old things and all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base.

At that time, some people thought that the power plant was special and could not act rashly; some people thought that rules and regulations were like a wasp's nest, untouchable, and should first "transition" for a period. All these things were poison injected by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. After finding the root cause, the proletarian revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress. All reactionary things, if you do not attack them, they will not fall." They then convened a full factory meeting of workers, exposing and denouncing the evil facts of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party promoting capitalist restoration. The workers, pointing at this small clique, indignantly said, "It is you who promote material incentives, corrupting workers. It is you who stubbornly cling to the revisionist rubbish, opposing Mao Zedong Thought." Such exposure and criticism made everyone further realize that to establish a new order for socialist production, one must start with "destruction."

The proletarian revolutionary masses immediately launched a wave of destroying the old and establishing the new throughout the factory.

The worker masses thoroughly dismantled the management structure that was layered, had excess personnel, was cumbersome, and had poor command, establishing a management system that emphasized politics and the mass line. Within the Revolutionary Committee, two leadership teams for revolution and production were established, and the excess management personnel were sent down to the teams to participate in production. Previously, there were teams under the teams, and tasks were divided under the teams. Now, according to the team's democratic election of three to five service personnel, non-detached service groups were formed. This greatly reduced the number of detached personnel, improved work efficiency, and basically achieved "streamlining administration and increasing efficiency."

The military supported the revolutionary masses in thoroughly destroying the old and establishing the new, firmly grasping two key points. First, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit. The process of destroying the old and establishing the new is also a process of the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves. Second, guiding the masses' revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude. Starting from reality, from revolutionary interests, and from what is beneficial to the development of productive forces. All rules and regulations that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought should be resolutely abolished and thoroughly destroyed; all technical operation procedures and safety operation procedures that reflect the objective laws of production struggle, as well as labor discipline representing revolutionary interests, should be resolutely executed and consciously observed.

Destroying the old and establishing the new, ultimately, is to thoroughly destroy bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought; it is to take the military as an example, adhere to the "four firsts," promote the "three-eight work style," making the factory's political atmosphere thick, raising people's class consciousness high, fully unleashing the enthusiasm for revolution and production, and increasing good people and good deeds. As soon as the troops entered the factory, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the army is not only a fighting force but mainly a working force," carrying forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, bringing the "four firsts" and "three-eight work style" to the factory, and putting them into practice in "grasp revolution, promote production." Under the influence of the military, the worker masses extensively studied Chairman Mao's works, sang revolutionary songs, everyone did ideological work, vigorously grasped living thoughts, breaking the previous dull atmosphere of focusing on production and ignoring politics, and sweeping away the previous slack and dragging work style.

The repair workshop, which previously had poor unity, waited for work to come to them, worked slowly, and often could not complete the spare parts and components on time, affecting the completion of the factory's overhaul plan. The workers in this workshop, working with the military, saw the military's spirit of enduring hardship and hard work, and were moved to say, "The military's model actions gave us a political lesson." They took the military as an example, vigorously grasped ideological work, strengthened unity, improved cooperation, actively sought work, and directly delivered the spare parts and components to the overhaul workers. The electrical repair team, which previously worked slackly, learned from the military and, in undertaking the minor overhaul task of furnace number eight, carried forward the spirit of bravely fighting, fearing no fatigue, and continuous combat, launching the "full-load work" activity, completing the overhaul project that originally required seventy-two workers with only twenty-two workers.

Previously, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within this factory saw things but not people, always reaching out to the state for money and materials. After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary masses carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, insisting on thrift in running the enterprise. Previously, the steel balls for the coal mills were all purchased from outside, but now they daringly innovated and successfully made them themselves. High-voltage ceramic sleeves that had been lying in the scrap yard for three years, urgently needed transformer filaments for production, coal mill main shafts, etc., were all repaired and made themselves. In more than a month, the worker masses successively proposed forty-five important innovation projects, of which thirty-two have been implemented, saving the state more than 270,000 yuan.

This factory overthrew the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, destroyed the revisionist management system, and the entire factory began to present the political situation described by Chairman Mao, which is both concentrated and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified will and individual comfort, lively and vibrant.

The workers said, "Previously, the upper level arranged and the lower level did; the upper level did not speak and the lower level stood. Now, without waiting for the upper level to arrange, everyone actively does it. 'Previously, problems were reported up the levels, problems found people; now, people find problems, and conflicts are resolved by themselves.'"

The spirit of communism flourished throughout the factory. Many workers voluntarily broke private interests and established public interests, seeing heavy burdens and taking them, seeing difficulties and overcoming them, actively cooperating and supporting each other, forming new relationships between teams, groups, and individuals.

The military collaborating with local authorities to manage industry must pass on the good experience of the military actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the factory, turning the factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the ideological revolutionization of people, and building a highly proletarianized and combat-ready red workforce.

The small clique of capitalist-roaders within this factory had always opposed Mao Zedong Thought, preventing workers from studying Chairman Mao's works. They openly held "private talks," saying things like "as long as private demands are satisfied, the enthusiasm of the broad masses can be mobilized," and "doing well in private is for doing well in public." They restricted workers from bringing Chairman Mao's books into the workshop, and if anyone recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations during rest time, they were criticized for "violating labor discipline."

The class enemies' frenzied opposition to Mao Zedong Thought aroused the indignation of the stationed military personnel. The soldiers said, "No matter how many conditions there are, ultimately it is one condition, grasping the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological revolutionization of people. 'Only by arming the workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought can the socialist enterprise be guaranteed to never change color.'" Therefore, in collaborating with the proletarian revolutionary masses to "grasp revolution and promote production," they placed helping workers actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle at the forefront of all work. In more than a month since entering the factory, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "propagandizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses," vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, widely spreading the experience of the military actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works, helping workers establish study systems such as "daily reading." Many military personnel entered the teams and dormitories, using "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a weapon, doing political and ideological work for the masses, answering and solving various problems that arose among the workers. The soldiers also bought more than 570 copies of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with their own money and gave them to their worker brothers.

In the rectification of the proletarian revolutionary masses, the stationed troops, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it, and the purpose of being proficient is entirely for application," vigorously promoted the method indicated by Comrade Lin Biao of "studying with problems, actively studying and applying, combining study and use, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing results immediately, and focusing on the 'use' character," actively helping the revolutionary masses use Mao Zedong Thought to seize the power of the "self" in their minds, turning the rectification into a mass Mao Zedong Thought educational movement.

Under the influence of the military, a mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has formed throughout the factory. The worker masses, with deep class feelings, treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all work, carrying out activities such as "studying quotations before class, observing actions during class, and checking effectiveness after class" and extensively reading, lecturing, discussing, and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Some teams, targeting problems in production, wrote relevant quotations from Chairman Mao on the shift handover records. They said, "This is handing over the shift with Mao Zedong Thought." The worker masses took the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, fiercely fighting the "self" in their minds, fiercely fighting the "difficult" in their work, and fiercely fighting the "floating" in their style. They said, "'The Three Constantly Read Articles' is a great mirror for dressing and a great basin for washing faces. It makes us clear-minded, sharp-eared, and skillful-handed. It washes us red-hearted, strong-boned, and bright-minded."

The entire workforce learned from the military, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, greatly changing their spiritual outlook. In the masonry team, some workers previously opened their mouths to talk about technical skills and wages, but now everyone talks about politics. Recently, five new apprentices joined the team, and the old workers said, "We must let the apprentices take over the socialist class, absolutely not lead them astray to the path of purely pursuing technology." They bought Chairman Mao's works and gave them to the apprentices. The apprentices gratefully said, "We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and work in the factory for life."

Facts have proven that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, the "self-first" theory spread by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party is bankrupt. The workers thoroughly exposed and criticized these reactionary fallacies, angrily pointing at these people and saying, "The party wants us to read Chairman Mao's books, emphasizing the 'public' character, but you want us to emphasize the 'self' character, holding 'private talks,' where do you want to lead us?!"

Facts have proven that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, the difficulties in production will be overcome one by one. During the intense days of the power seizure struggle, the overhaul of furnace number one began. The conservatives created obstacles, and with two-thirds of the time already passed, the progress of the project was still less than half completed, proposing to extend the deadline by five days to complete the task. The revolutionary masses did not agree, saying, "We are proletarian revolutionary masses, and if we do not complete the task, we will let down Chairman Mao." We cooperated with each other, fought day and night, and finally completed the task two days ahead of schedule. In late February, the slag outlet of furnace number eight was blocked by coke. According to the usual practice, it would take three days to stop the furnace for limited electricity repair. The workers studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," with the spirit of "firmly deciding, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," enduring a temperature of sixty degrees, producing while repairing, and created the moving feat of repairing without stopping production.

Now, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of the First Thermal Power Plant of Taiyuan, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to turn the factory into a great furnace for cultivating and transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought, and into a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

    革命统帅生产
    ——山西省军区某部协同太原第一热电厂无产阶级革命派管理工业的基本经验
    中国人民解放军山西省军区某部，协同地方管工业，同太原第一热电厂无产阶级革命派一道，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全厂职工精神面貌焕然一新，生产呈现出一片欣欣向荣的局面，创造了一九五五年投产以来设备出力的最高水平。夺权后的二月份，与去年同期相比，总产值增长百分之二十八，发电量增长百分之三十九，供热量增长百分之十一点八六。在设备出力超负荷百分之五点二的情况下，煤耗和厂用电的经济指标也都达到了国家计划要求，并做到了安全无事故。
    军队协同地方管工业，要按照毛主席的指示，坚决支持左派广大群众，把革命放在首位，在阶级斗争中建立革命的“三结合”，充分发挥“三结合”的威力
    多年来，太原第一热电厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，招降纳叛，结党营私，竭力推行修正主义，把社会主义的企业引上了邪路。无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们又顽固地坚持执行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，大搞经济主义，唆使一些受蒙蔽的职工离开生产岗位，使全厂生产面临停顿的危险。广大职工对他们的所作所为，无比愤慨，纷纷起来造他们的反，夺他们的权。就在夺权斗争的关键时刻，山西省军区某部遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的指示，来到这个工厂。
    解放军来厂前，厂内的群众组织“红联”、“东风”已经夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。另一个叫作“红卫兵总队”的组织，正在进行反夺权。两派斗争异常激烈，都迫切要求解放军给以支持。到底该支持那一派？进厂部队按照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的指示，深入到车间、班、组，同工人、干部一起学习毛主席语录，开座谈会，个别谈心，倾听各方面的意见。他们做到了“五看”：一看其组织是怎样产生和形成的；二看谁对走资本主义道路当权派斗争最勇敢，最坚决，最彻底；三看谁听毛主席的话，一贯坚持“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的方针；四看谁受走资本主义道路当权派的歧视和打击；五看谁能团结群众大多数，实现大联合。通过调查研究，进行阶级分析，肯定了“红联”、“东风”是革命组织，于是就毅然决然地支持了他们的革命行动。
    毛主席说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派立即进行疯狂反扑。他们纠集社会渣滓，利用保守组织，煽阴风，点邪火，颠倒黑白，造谣惑众，甚至对革命派工人行凶，把矛头直接指向伟大的人民解放军。驻厂部队和革命派坚决打击了反革命的嚣张气焰，拘捕了行凶犯。对受蒙蔽的群众，则反复交代党的政策，启发他们的阶级觉悟，使他们同一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限。在全厂职工大会上，受蒙蔽的群众以活生生的事实，揭发和控诉走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。三天内，全厂受蒙蔽群众的绝大多数退出了保守组织。不少人紧紧握着部队同志的手，激动地说：“解放军把我们拉回正道上来了。今后，我们一定要向解放军学习，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。”
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，严峻地考验了干部队伍，证明大多数干部是好的和比较好的。但是，革命派中有一些同志，在对待干部问题上存在着一些错误认识：一怕干部站出来，重新掌权，打击报复；二怕支持革命干部站出来，有人攻击自己是“保皇派”。在干部中也存在着“三怕”：怕分不清谁是革命派，站错了队；怕站出来群众不信任；怕群众说自己站出来是“政治投机”。针对这些错误思想，驻厂部队组织革命派学习毛主席关于干部政策的论述和《红旗》杂志有关社论。在提高认识的基础上，革命派积极对革命干部做工作，欢迎他们站出来，一道闹革命。对一些犯错误的干部，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”、“团结——批评——团结”的方针，主动接近他们，帮助他们认识和改正错误，放下包袱，轻装前进。在解放军和革命派的耐心帮助下，许多革命干部和革命的工程技术人员站了出来。一些犯错误的干部，也回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    这样，这个厂的革命的“三结合”，就在阶级斗争中形成了。全厂建立了由革命干部（领导干部、一般干部、技术人员）、工人代表（老工人、青年工人）和解放军代表组成的“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会。在生产班组，也建立了由工人代表、民兵代表和技术人员组成的“三结合”服务小组。广大革命职工根据毛主席“组织任务须服从于政治任务”的教导，已经按部门、按班组实现了自下而上的大联合。
    革命的“三结合”显示了无比强大的生命力。在革命委员会的领导下，无产阶级革命派树立了革命权威，打击了反革命的气焰，巩固与扩大了夺权斗争的成果。目前，正在乘胜前进，实现一斗、二批、三改的任务。
      军队协同地方管工业，要把解放军坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风的好经验传到工厂，要突出政治，充分发挥人的积极因素，彻底破除束缚生产力发展的陈规旧章，建立社会主义生产的新秩序
    毛主席说，政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”
    长期以来，这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反对毛泽东思想，坚持推行修正主义的东西，散布什么“指标任务完成了，财神爷就来了”，“技术硬一硬百硬”，压制了工人群众的革命积极性和创造性，束缚了生产力的发展，使企业滑向了资本主义的邪路。工人群众十分愤慨地说：“这一小撮人就是物质挂帅，制度治人。不搞思想革命化，只搞制度乱加码。”
    驻厂部队协同无产阶级革命派夺权后，坚决支持革命群众向资本主义、修正主义的旧东西，向一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，猛烈开火。
    当时，有人认为，电厂特殊，不能轻举妄动；有人认为，规章制度是马蜂窝，捅不得，先“过渡”一个时期再说。所有这些东西，都是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派灌输的毒素。根子找到后，无产阶级革命派学习了毛主席教导的：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”，“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”接着，召开了全厂职工大会，揭发和控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞资本主义复辟的罪恶事实。工人们指着这一小撮人愤慨地说：“就是你们搞物质刺激，腐蚀工人。就是你们死抱修正主义的破烂，反对毛泽东思想。”这样的揭露和批判，使大家进一步认识到，要大立社会主义生产的新秩序，就必须“破”字当头。
    无产阶级革命派随即在全厂掀起了破旧立新的热潮。
    工人群众大破层次重迭、人浮于事、组织庞大、指挥不灵的管理机构，建立了突出政治、突出群众路线的管理制度。在革命委员会内建立了革命、生产两个领导班子，把多余的管理人员下放到班组参加生产。过去是班下设组，组下分摊。现在按照班组民主选举三至五名服务员，组成不脱产的服务小组。这就大大减少了脱产人员，提高了工作效率，基本上做到了“精兵简政”。
    解放军支持革命群众大搞破旧立新，紧紧掌握了两个要点。一是相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神。破旧立新的过程，也是群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的过程。二是因势利导，把群众的革命精神和科学态度结合起来。一切从实际出发，从革命利益出发，从有利于生产力的发展出发。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的规章制度，就坚决废除，大破特破；凡是反映生产斗争客观规律的技术操作规程和安全操作规程，以及代表革命利益的劳动纪律，就坚决执行，自觉遵守。
    破旧立新，归根到底，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想；就是要以解放军为榜样，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，把工厂的政治空气搞得浓浓的，把人的阶级觉悟提得高高的，把革命与生产的干劲鼓得足足的，把好人好事增得多多的。部队一进厂，就按照毛主席的“军队不但是一个战斗队，而且主要地是一个工作队”的教导，发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，把四个第一、三八作风带到工厂，用到“抓革命，促生产”的实践中去。工人群众在解放军的带动下，大学毛主席著作，大唱革命歌曲，人人做思想工作，狠抓活的思想，打破了过去埋头生产、不问政治的沉闷空气，扫除了过去那种松松垮垮、拖拖拉拉的作风。
    修配机工班，过去团结不好，等活上门，干活拖拉，常常因为配件备品赶制不出来，影响全厂检修计划的完成。这个班的工人，同解放军一起劳动，看到解放军那种吃大苦、耐大劳的劲头，感动地说：“解放军的模范行动给我们上了一堂政治课。”他们以解放军为榜样，大抓政治思想工作，加强团结，搞好协作，主动上门揽活，把备品配件直接送到检修工人手里。配电检修班，过去工作也是松松垮垮的。他们学习解放军后，在担负八号炉小修任务中，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，开展“满负荷工作”的活动，使原来需要七十二个工才能完成的检修项目，用二十二个工就完成了。
    过去，这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派见物不见人，凡事伸手向国家要钱要物。夺权后，无产阶级革命派发扬自力更生的精神，坚持勤俭办企业。过去磨煤机钢球一直靠外购，现在他们大胆创新，自制成功。在废料库躺了三年之久的高压瓷套管，生产上急迫需要的灯丝变压器，磨煤机主轴等等，都修复和自制出来了。一个多月以来，工人群众先后提出重要革新项目四十五项，目前已实现三十二项，为国家节约了二十七万多元的财富。
    这个厂打倒了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，摧毁了修正主义的管理制度，全厂开始出现象毛主席所说的，又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面。
    工人们说：“过去是上边布置下边干，上边不说下边站；现在是不等上边布置，大家都主动去干。”“过去碰到问题是逐级上交，问题找人；现在是人找问题，有矛盾自己解决。”
    全厂共产主义风格大发扬。许多工人自觉地破私立公，见重担就抢，见困难就上，主动配合，互相支援，在班与班、组与组、人与人之间出现了崭新的关系。
      军队协同地方管工业，要把解放军活学活用毛主席著作的好经验送到工厂，把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校，促进人的思想革命化，建设一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的红色职工队伍
    这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯反对毛泽东思想，阻止工人学习毛主席著作。他们公然召开“谈私会”，说什么“尽量满足私的要求，才能调动广大群众的积极性”，“搞好私是为了搞好公”。他们限制工人把毛主席的书带进工房，有谁在休息时念一段毛主席语录，就被指责为“违犯劳动纪律”。
    阶级敌人疯狂反对毛泽东思想，激起了驻厂解放军指战员的无比愤慨。战士们说：“抓千条，抓万条，归根结底就是一条，抓活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。”“只有用毛泽东思想武装工人的头脑，才能保证社会主义企业永不变色。”因此，他们在协同无产阶级革命派“抓革命，促生产”中，把帮助工人在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，放在一切工作的首位。进厂一个多月中，他们遵照毛主席“宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众”的教导，大力宣传毛泽东思想，广泛传播解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验。他们带头学习毛主席著作，帮助工人建立“天天读”等学习制度。许多指战员深入到班组、宿舍，以《毛主席语录》为武器，向群众做政治思想工作，回答和解决工人中出现的各种问题。战士们还自己出钱购买了五百七十多本“老三篇”，送给工人兄弟。
    在无产阶级革命派整风中，驻厂部队根据毛主席“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用”的教导，大力推广林彪同志指示的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的方法，积极帮助革命群众，用毛泽东思想去夺头脑中“私”字的权，把整风变成群众性的毛泽东思想的教育运动。
    在解放军带动下，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动已经在全厂形成。工人群众带着深厚的阶级感情，把毛主席的书当做各项工作的最高指示，开展“班前学语录，班中看行动，班后查实效”和大读、大讲、大议、大用“老三篇”的活动。有的班组针对生产中存在的问题，把毛主席的有关语录写在交接班记录上。他们说：“这是用毛泽东思想交接班。”工人群众以“老三篇”为座右铭，在思想上狠斗“私”字，在工作上狠斗“难”字，在作风上狠斗“浮”字。他们说：“‘老三篇’是天大的穿衣镜，地大的洗脸盆。它照得我们心明、耳灵、手儿巧，它洗得我们心红、骨硬、思想亮。”
    全厂职工向解放军学习，活学活用毛主席著作，大大改变了精神面貌。瓦工班有的工人，过去一开口就讲技术高低，工资多少，现在是人人讲政治。最近班里来了五名新徒工，老工人说：“咱们要让徒工接社会主义的班，绝不能把他们引向单纯搞技术的邪路。”他们买来毛主席著作赠给徒工。徒工们感激地说：“我们一定听毛主席的话，在工厂干一辈子。”
    事实证明，伟大的毛泽东思想一经掌握了群众，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所散布的“私字当头”论，就破产了。工人们彻底揭露和批判了这些反动谬论，愤怒地指着这些人说：“党要我们读毛主席的书，突出‘公’字，你要我们突出‘私’字，要开什么‘谈私会’，你们到底要把我们引到什么地方去？！”
    事实证明，伟大的毛泽东思想一经掌握了群众，生产上的难关就会一个个被闯过。在夺权斗争的紧张日子里，一号炉开始大修。保守派从中刁难，工期已过三分之二，工程进度还不及一半，提出要延期五天完成任务。革命派不答应，说：“我们是无产阶级革命派，完不成任务就对不起毛主席。”我们互相协作，昼夜奋战，终于提前两天完成了任务。二月下旬，八号炉渣口结焦堵塞，按常规要停炉三天限电检修。工人们学习“老三篇”，以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的精神，冒着六十度高温，一面生产，一面检修，创造了检修不停产的动人事迹。
    现在，太原第一热电厂的革命干部和革命工人，正在革命委员会领导下，在人民解放军协助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力把工厂变为一座用毛泽东思想培养和改造人的大熔炉，办成一座红通通的毛泽东思想的大学校。
