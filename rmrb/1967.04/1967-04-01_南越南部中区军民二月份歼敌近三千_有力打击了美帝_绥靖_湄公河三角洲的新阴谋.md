The military and people of South Vietnam's Central South Region, located in the Mekong Delta, have fully demonstrated the invincible might of the people's war. In February, they launched extensive and continuous attacks, delivering a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' new plot to "pacify" the delta and achieving brilliant results. According to statistics, local military and people have killed, wounded, and captured 2,827 enemy soldiers (including 725 American invaders), completely annihilated two enemy main force battalions, two companies, and six platoons.

During this period, the military and people of the Central South Region also destroyed and damaged 29 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and 14 other military vehicles. They shot down and destroyed 25 enemy aircraft, seized over 200 pieces of various weapons, burned 120,000 liters of gasoline, captured five enemy strongholds and bunkers, and destroyed over 20 artillery pieces and machine guns.

In February, the guerrilla fighters in various anti-American zones of the Central South Region further tightened their encirclement of the U.S. invaders, frequently striking the enemy. Just the military and people in the Di Bau anti-American encirclement zone in Tien Giang Province and the Phuoc Long anti-American encirclement zone in My Tho Province killed 644 American invaders this month. Meanwhile, the military and people of the Central South Region continued to attack enemy supply lines and rear bases, making the American bandits and their lackeys even more panicked.

Additionally, under the continuous attacks of the liberation armed forces, the enemy forces further disintegrated. According to incomplete statistics, over 2,600 enemy soldiers deserted this month, refusing to continue fighting for the U.S.-puppet clique. According to another report from the Liberation Communications Agency, the military and people of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area engaged in 157 battles in January and February, killing 3,117 enemy soldiers (including 2,400 American invaders), destroying and heavily damaging 414 tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down and damaging 42 aircraft.

According to a report from the Liberation Communications Agency, the liberation armed forces and guerrilla units in the provinces of Vinh Long, Binh Duong, and Bien Hoa in South Vietnam recently launched continuous attacks and achieved new victories.

The guerrilla forces in Vinh Long Province attacked the U.S. military airfield in Vinh Long City on the night of March 8, destroying four enemy aircraft and killing 19 American invaders.

The liberation armed forces in Binh Duong Province almost completely annihilated an enemy main force company on the road from Vu Sua to Trang Bang on the morning of March 6.
