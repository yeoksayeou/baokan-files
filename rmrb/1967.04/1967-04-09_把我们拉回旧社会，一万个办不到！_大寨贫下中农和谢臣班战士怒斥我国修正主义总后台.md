The poor and lower-middle peasants of Da Zhai in Shanxi Province's Xiyang County, revolutionary cadres, and the soldiers of the unit where the "model of love for the people" Xie Sheng served before his death have recently held a rally to denounce the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They declared that they would more firmly safeguard the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Da Zhai Brigade Party Committee, spoke with great indignation: Tell you, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, who loves us and who hates us, we poor and lower-middle peasants know best. Chairman Mao loves us the most and is heart-to-heart with us. The top capitalist-roader within the Party talks nonsense about "hiring labor is not exploitation, it increases social wealth," "hiring workers to farm is legal and beneficial to the people," and so on. This is nothing but the philosophy of landlords and rich peasants. Only landlords and rich peasants would say that hiring workers to farm is legal. In the old society, it was precisely because landlords and rich peasants were allowed to hire workers that the laboring people were exploited and suffered. How many families were ruined and destroyed! I was born in the southern mountains and grew up in the western mountains. I couldn't make a living in the western mountains, so at the age of six, I moved to Da Zhai. Even in Da Zhai, life was miserable. In desperation, my father sold my mother, sister, and brother, and finally, he hanged himself. This is the result of "hiring workers to farm is legal"! This is the evil of the exploitative system! The exploiting class is our sworn enemy! We poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered enough from exploitation. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have today's sweet life. The top capitalist-roader within the Party still wants to drag us back to the old society where people eat each other. A thousand times no, a million times no!

Jia Xiu Lan, daughter of the old revolutionary hero Jia Jin Cai of Da Zhai, said: The top capitalist-roader within the Party says that the laboring people welcome exploitation. This is sheer nonsense. My mother started working for the landlord's family at the age of eleven, and the stove top wore out her clothes. When she asked the landlord's wife for a piece of cloth to patch them, the landlord's wife said, "Can your stomach wear out too?" The words of the top capitalist-roader within the Party are just like those of the landlord's wife! We will never forget our class bitterness and hatred of exploitation. We poor and lower-middle peasants must join the battle, overthrow the top capitalist-roader within the Party, eliminate his poison, and ensure that the red regime will never change color!

Xie Qi, the younger brother of the "model of love for the people" Xie Sheng and the platoon leader of the Xie Sheng Platoon, said: The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the backstage boss of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party, a Khrushchev sleeping in our midst. Now that he has been exposed, this is a great and joyful event. Chairman Mao is the savior of the laboring people, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We of the Xie Sheng Platoon will carry forward the glorious tradition of the "model of love for the people" Xie Sheng, who loved Chairman Mao boundlessly and was loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and served the people wholeheartedly. We will add luster to Chairman Mao and the people. We will fight alongside the revolutionary masses to pull down the Chinese Khrushchev and make him step aside.

The brigade accountant Zhao Suheng and the brigade member Jia Cunsuo also spoke at the meeting. Jia Cunsuo said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from the province to the county, a handful of those within the Party who take the capitalist road have been exposed. The backstage boss is originally this top capitalist-roader within the Party. We must overthrow him.

In recent days, in the dining halls, fields, and construction sites of Da Zhai Brigade, the voices denouncing the top capitalist-roader within the Party have been heard everywhere. The poor and lower-middle peasants and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army said: The military and the people will rise up with a thousand-pound hammer to pull down the top capitalist-roader within the Party. We will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

    把我们拉回旧社会，一万个办不到！
    大寨贫下中农和谢臣班战士怒斥我国修正主义总后台
    据新华社太原八日电　山西省昔阳县大寨大队的贫下中农、革命干部和前来大寨支援春耕生产的“爱民模范”谢臣生前所在部队的指战员，最近集会愤怒声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。他们表示，要更加坚定地保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把文化大革命进行到底！
    大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵非常激愤地说：告诉你，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，谁爱我们，谁恨我们，我们贫下中农最清楚。毛主席他老人家最爱我们，和我们心连心。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派胡说什么“雇人劳动，不叫剥削，它增加了社会财富”，“雇工种地是合法的，对群众也有好处”，等等，这完全是地主、富农的哲学。只有地主、富农才说雇工种地是合法的。在旧社会，就是因地主、富农雇工是合法的，劳动人民受剥削是应该的，不知有多少人家破人亡。我生在南山，长在后山，在西山生活不下去，六岁上才搬来大寨。旧社会，天下乌鸦一般黑。到大寨还是活不出来。无奈，我父亲卖了我母亲、姐姐和弟弟，最后，他还落得上吊自杀。这就是“雇工种地是合法的”的结果！这就是剥削制度的罪恶！剥削阶级是我们的死对头！受剥削的苦，我们贫下中农尝够了。在毛主席的英明领导下，我们贫下中农才有了今天的甜。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，还想把我们拉到那人吃人的旧社会去，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    大寨老英雄贾进才的女儿贾秀兰说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，说什么劳动人民欢迎剥削，这真是胡说八道。我母亲十一岁上就给地主家做饭，灶火台把衣服磨破了，向地主婆子要块布补，地主婆子说：“肚皮还能磨破了？”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所说的话，和地主婆子真是一个腔调！什么时候，我们也不忘阶级苦，不忘剥削恨。我们贫下中农，一定要投入战斗，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派打倒，肃清他的流毒，保证红色江山永不变色！
      “爱民模范”谢臣的弟弟、谢臣班的班长谢起说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的总后台，是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。现在把他揪出来了，这是一件大快人心的好事。毛主席是我们劳动人民的救命恩人，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我们谢臣班，一定要发扬“爱民模范”谢臣同志无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，全心全意为人民服务的光荣传统，为毛主席增光，为人民增光。我们一定要和革命派一起战斗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫拉下马，让他靠边站。
    大队会计赵素恒、社员贾存锁也在会上发了言。贾存锁说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，从省到县，揪出党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，后台老板原来就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。我们非把他打倒不可。
    连日来，在大寨大队的饭场、地头和工地上，都是愤怒声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的声音。贫下中农和解放军指战员说：军民奋起千钧棒，誓把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马。不获全胜，决不收兵！
