U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a highly unsuccessful trip to Western Europe. Wherever Humphrey went, anti-American demonstrations erupted. Everywhere, shouts of "Yankees go home from Vietnam" rang out. This head of American imperialism was pelted with rotten eggs. As one Western journalist put it, "Anti-American demonstrations accompanied this visit from beginning to end." Truly, he was like a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat him.

The Johnson clique has been boasting that their policy of aggression against Vietnam has gained widespread "understanding" and "sympathy," attempting to deceive others and themselves. Humphrey's miserable experience in Western Europe once again exposed their lies.

One of Humphrey's main purposes in this trip was to seek support for America's aggression in Vietnam. However, he instead stirred up an unprecedented wave of opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam among the broad masses of Western European peoples. Even in Western Europe, which the U.S. ruling clique has long considered "stable," anti-American sentiment is so intense. How much more can be imagined in other regions of the world? Humphrey originally intended to improve the desperate situation of U.S. imperialism, which has lost the support of the people. Instead, he made it even more apparent how much U.S. imperialism has lost the hearts of the people and how isolated it has become.

At the beginning of his visit, Humphrey had boasted that he hoped this trip to Western Europe would be "a fruitful visit." If Humphrey's trip had any "fruit," it was only that he mobilized the Western European peoples to oppose U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Mao has said, "The aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism always lead to the opposite of its wishes, serving to mobilize the people of the whole world to oppose the U.S. aggressors." U.S. imperialism will never give up its role as a negative teacher, nor will it stop its work of mobilizing the people. It will continue to invade, continue to provoke the peoples of various countries to rise up against it, and plunge itself into the encirclement of the peoples of the whole world, until its ultimate doom.

### 适得其反

    适得其反
    美国副总统汉弗莱在西欧作了一次极不光采的旅行。汉弗莱到哪里，哪里就掀起了反美示威。到处响起了“美国佬滚出越南”的吼声。这个美帝国主义的头目挨尽了臭鸡蛋。用西方记者的话来说，“反美示威始终贯穿着这次访问”。真是老鼠过街，人人喊打。
    约翰逊之流一直吹嘘说什么美国侵略越南的政策是得到了广泛的“谅解”和“同情”的，企图拿这个来欺骗别人，欺骗自己。汉弗莱在西欧的倒霉的遭遇，又一次揭穿了他们的这种鬼话。
    汉弗莱此行的主要目的之一，是为美国的侵越政策寻求支持。然而，他却激起了广大西欧人民空前高涨的反对美国侵越战争的浪潮。在美国统治集团一向认为“安稳”的西欧大陆，反美情绪尚且如此强烈，那末，在世界的其他地区，不是更可以想见了吗？汉弗莱本来想改善一下美帝国主义失道寡助的狼狈处境，结果却是使人更加看到美帝国主义是如何的失尽人心，空前孤立。
    汉弗莱开始访问时，曾经兴致勃勃地扬言他希望这次出访西欧是“一次有成果的旅行”。如果说汉弗莱此行有什么“成果”的话，那只能适得其反，就是对西欧人民作了一次反对美帝国主义的动员。
    毛主席说过，美帝国主义的侵略活动，总是走向它的愿望的反面，“起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用”。美帝国主义是决不会放弃它的反面教员的职务的，决不会停止它的这种动员人民的作用的。它总是要不断地侵略，不断地促使各国人民起来反对它，使自己陷于全世界人民的重重包围之中，直至最后的灭亡。
