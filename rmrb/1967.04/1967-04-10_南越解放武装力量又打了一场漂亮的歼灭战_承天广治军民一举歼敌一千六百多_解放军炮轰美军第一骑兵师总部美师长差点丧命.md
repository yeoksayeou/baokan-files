According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 9th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: The liberation armed forces in the provinces of Thua Thien and Quang Tri in South Vietnam have launched another brilliant offensive. On the night of the 5th to the early hours of the 6th, they launched simultaneous and fierce attacks on the enemy bases of Tich Gia in Thua Thien Province and La Vang in Quang Tri Province, and infiltrated the city of Quang Tri to attack the enemy strongholds of the American and puppet forces. They annihilated more than 1,650 enemy personnel, destroyed over 200 vehicles of various types, 13 cannons, and 3 aircraft.

The enemy's 1st Division, 1st and 3rd Regiments, and the command posts stationed in Tich Gia and La Vang bases were completely annihilated. The enemy forces in the American "advisory" office, the puppet administrative office, and the puppet military command in Quang Tri City were almost entirely wiped out.

In the Tich Gia area, the liberation armed forces, after more than an hour of fierce battle, completely annihilated the enemy at the command post of the puppet 3rd Regiment, an armored battalion, two infantry companies, two artillery companies, a transport company, and a tank detachment. They killed nearly 700 enemy personnel, including 100 American invaders, and the commander of the puppet 3rd Regiment was killed.

In La Vang Town, the liberation armed forces, after a 30-minute fierce battle, completely annihilated the enemy at the command post of the puppet 1st Regiment, killing many American "advisors" and puppet regiment commanders. They annihilated an infantry battalion, an armored battalion, an artillery company, a security company, a transport company, and a tank detachment, killing and dispersing over 750 enemy personnel.

In Quang Tri City, the liberation armed forces killed more than 200 enemy personnel, including 70 American "advisors" and many officials of the puppet government in Quang Tri Province. The liberation armed forces occupied the city for four hours.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, Saigon news reported that on the morning of the 9th, the South Vietnamese liberation army launched a fierce artillery attack on the headquarters of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division located at the An Khe base, nearly killing the division commander.

Western news agencies reported that the An Khe base is "the largest landing site in the central highlands for the U.S. invaders' helicopters." On the morning of the 9th, the base was attacked by the liberation army and hit by about 100 high-explosive mortar shells.

The division's spokesman admitted that in this attack, at least 10 helicopters were destroyed, and more than 20 American invaders were killed or injured. He also revealed that during this attack, the division commander, Tolson, narrowly escaped death. Tolson, after attending an invasion meeting at the U.S. military base in Da Nang, was returning to the base in a helicopter when he was hit by intense ground fire from the liberation army. A bullet struck the helicopter he was in, shattering the windshield in front of him, and the bullet whizzed past just nine inches from his left ear.
