The People's Liberation Army unit of the Shanghai Garrison recently organized a meeting for its cadres and soldiers who had been sent to factories to share and summarize their experiences in supporting industrial work. The unit emphasized that in supporting industry, it is essential to prioritize politics and arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

The unit has enthusiastically responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the military to support the revolutionary left and aid industrial and agricultural production. Since late January, the unit has dispatched Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to various factories in the vicinity. The unit's Party Committee regularly visits these factories to inspect and understand the work and thoughts of these propaganda teams. Recently, the Party Committee discovered that most of the propaganda teams have been able to consistently prioritize politics, treating political and ideological work as the foundation of their support for industry. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to arm the revolutionary masses and guide the revolution and production. However, a few propaganda teams, when faced with complex class struggles and numerous specific tasks, have not effectively prioritized politics. They have been busy helping the revolutionary factions handle various specific issues, neglecting to focus on propagating Mao Zedong Thought. As a result, the revolution in the factories has not been effectively carried out, and production has not been fully improved. After discovering this problem, the Party Committee immediately gathered all the propaganda teams for a two-day study and discussion session to summarize their experiences. The teams repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the guiding force and the soul, reviewed the unit's history of prioritizing politics, and analyzed and discussed the various issues they encountered after entering the factories. They focused on resolving the following three key issues:

Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the workers' minds, the workers themselves can solve specific problems.

Some comrades believed that since Chairman Mao called for the military to support industry, they should devote all their efforts to improving industrial production. If production does not increase, how can they justify this to Chairman Mao? Through discussion, everyone came to understand that Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the guiding force and the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Prioritizing politics is the fundamental principle of our military construction and also of factory construction. Our support for industry fundamentally involves bringing the military's tradition of prioritizing politics into the factories, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the worker masses, correct the direction of the enterprise, and turn the factory into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. Once this aspect of work is done well, people's thoughts will be revolutionized, and production will naturally improve. Some comrades said: If we only focus on production and neglect politics, not only will the revolution be ineffective, and production will not improve, but there is also the danger of the factory returning to the path of capitalist restoration. Only by prioritizing politics and Mao Zedong Thought, using revolution to drive production, can we truly promote production and meet Chairman Mao's requirements, justifying his trust in us.

Some comrades said that the worker masses have high expectations for the People's Liberation Army, and many come to us with various specific problems, hoping we will help solve them. If we do not assist them, they will be disappointed, and how can we justify this to the masses? Through discussion, everyone realized that the People's Liberation Army has high prestige among the masses because our army is personally founded by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Chairman Lin. It is because our army holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and prioritizes proletarian politics. The workers' expectations of the army are for us to carry forward our fine traditions in the factories, prioritize politics, and help them better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Only by always remembering to prioritize politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses can we truly maintain the army's high prestige and fundamentally meet the masses' expectations of the army. Some comrades said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party." Believing in the Party means believing in the power of Mao Zedong Thought; believing in the masses means believing that the masses, once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can solve any problem. Our few individuals' role is limited, but the power of Mao Zedong Thought is limitless. Once the workers' minds are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can solve specific problems themselves, and they can do it better than we can. Some comrades said: To maintain the army's prestige and meet the masses' demands, the only way is to firmly prioritize politics and genuinely place the organization of workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything. We must never reverse the priorities.

Who are the true revolutionaries, who are the false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, should be judged by the revolutionary masses.

Some comrades, after entering the factories, did not fully carry out political and ideological work, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and mobilize the masses. They hastily took sides in the disputes between various mass organizations within the factory and between mass organizations and revolutionary masses, acting as "judges." They said that Chairman Mao called for the military to actively support the revolutionary left, and the factory's revolutionary organizations urgently needed our support, so how could we not take a stand? During the discussion, everyone realized that there are many factions in the factory, and who are the true revolutionaries and who are the false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, the masses know best. This "judge" should be played by the revolutionary masses, and a few propaganda team members cannot and should not play this role. Our task is to use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the worker masses, helping them see clearly and make their own judgments. If we do not do this but instead eagerly act as "judges," even if we "judge" correctly, we cannot achieve the goal of the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves; if we "judge" incorrectly, it would be even worse. Of course, we should actively and openly support the true revolutionary left. However, only by arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and conducting thorough investigations and studies among the masses can we make correct judgments and ensure that our support has a mass foundation.

Through the discussion, various misunderstandings were clarified. Everyone said that although local work is different from military work, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything is completely the same. Although local work is very complex and can be described as having countless details, prioritizing politics and doing well in ideological work can make everything else fall into place. Everyone expressed that they would definitely more firmly prioritize politics, genuinely use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution and direct production, thus successfully completing the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao to the military.

To further enhance the workers' awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works.

How to prioritize politics in supporting the left and aiding industry? The comrades participating in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams exchanged experiences. Everyone agreed that the following three tasks should be prioritized at present. First, further enhance the workers' awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone felt that in the worker masses, it is not enough to just organize study groups and set study rules to create a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. It is necessary to repeatedly propagate Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on the significance of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, making everyone more consciously study and apply them. It is necessary to introduce to the worker masses the army's experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on practical use. It is necessary to link the factory's struggles to explain that following Chairman Mao's instructions, everything can be done well, and without following Chairman Mao's instructions, nothing can be done well. At the same time, it is necessary to focus on one or two important issues in the factory's current struggles, and together with the worker masses, study Chairman Mao's works with these issues in mind, making the worker masses taste the sweetness and learn the methods. Many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams did this, and the worker masses' awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works greatly improved. Now, many factories' workers insist on studying before and after work, achieving immediate results. They said: The army helped us study Chairman Mao's works, truly helping us at the core, this is the greatest support, the best support, and the most fundamental support.

To vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production."

Second, vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Everyone agreed that supporting industry first requires supporting the revolutionary masses to focus on the revolution, truly achieving the goal of grasping revolution and promoting production, using revolution to drive production. To grasp the revolution at present, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate various ideological obstacles to great unity and the "three-in-one combination," promoting great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sent to the Shanghai Flour Mill found that there were errors of factionalism, exclusivism, and self-satisfaction within the revolutionary faction of the flour mill. They studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" with them, making them realize the importance of transforming their subjective world and consciously engaging in the struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, enthusiastically helping them conduct open rectification. After the rectification, the revolutionary faction's ranks rapidly expanded. The leader of the revolutionary faction emotionally said: "The army helped us conduct rectification, eliminating selfishness and increasing public-mindedness, expanding our ranks." In the process of implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the propaganda team members, together with the revolutionary faction leaders, studied Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre policies and the editorials of the Red Flag magazine, helping them correctly treat cadres and actively conducting political and ideological work for revolutionary cadres. The vast majority of the factory's cadres stood up, and five revolutionary leading cadres participated in the leadership of the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres deeply felt: "The establishment of the revolutionary committee is the result of everyone studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, it is Mao Zedong Thought that has united us." Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the flour mill's revolutionary and production situation is getting better every day. In March, the production volume increased by 11.48% compared to February, and the quality reached 99.95%.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought should be combined with helping workers solve specific problems.

Third, propagating Mao Zedong Thought should be combined with helping worker masses solve specific problems, using specific problems to address the root causes. Everyone agreed that studying Chairman Mao's works requires active application and linking to reality, this is the only way to achieve immediate results and success. The various specific problems in the factory, we certainly cannot interfere with or take over; however, many specific problems are directly related to the current struggles and cannot be completely ignored. If we do not address specific problems but only conduct general propaganda, we cannot truly achieve the goal of arming the worker masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

    支援工业要突出无产阶级政治
    用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑
    上海警备区某部组织下厂指战员交流和总结支援工业工作经验
    本报讯　上海警备区某部派往各个工厂的毛泽东思想宣传队，最近交流和总结了经验，强调在支援工业工作中一定要突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑。
    这个部队热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席关于解放军要支持革命左派、支援工农业生产的号召，从一月下旬起，对驻地附近的许多工厂，陆续派出了毛泽东思想宣传队。部队党委负责同志经常深入工厂，检查了解这些宣传队的工作和思想情况。最近，部队党委发现大部分宣传队能够坚持突出政治，把政治思想工作当作支援工业的全盘工作的基础，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，用毛泽东思想统帅革命，指挥生产。但是，也有少数宣传队，在错综复杂的阶级斗争和千头万绪的具体工作面前，没有很好地突出政治。他们每天忙于协助革命派处理一些具体问题，不能用主要力量宣传毛泽东思想，结果厂里的革命没有抓好，生产也没有完全搞好。部队党委发现这个问题以后，立即把各个宣传队集中起来，用两天时间学习讨论，总结经验。大家反复学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，回忆了部队走过的突出政治的道路，对进厂以后碰到的种种问题，进行分析讨论，着重解决了以下三个活思想。
    用毛泽东思想武装了工人的头脑，工人自己就能去解决具体问题
    有的同志认为，毛主席号召军队支援工业，我们就要用全力抓好工业生产，如果生产上不去，怎么对得起毛主席呢？通过讨论，大家明确认识到，毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。突出政治是我们军队建设的根本，也是工厂建设的根本。我们支援工业，根本的一条，就是要把部队突出政治的优良传统带进工厂，用毛泽东思想武装工人群众，端正企业的方向，把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。这方面的工作做好了，人的思想革命化了，生产也就上去了。有的同志说：如果只管生产，不管政治，不但革命搞不好，生产上不去，还有使工厂回到资本主义复辟道路的危险。只有突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，以革命带动生产，才能真正把生产促上去，才符合毛主席对我们的要求，才对得起毛主席的信任。
    有的同志说，工人群众对解放军寄予很大的希望，来找我们谈话的人很多，向我们提出了各种各样的具体问题，如果不帮助他们解决这些问题，就会使他们失望，那怎么对得起群众呢？通过讨论，大家认识到，人民解放军在群众中有崇高的威信，是因为我们军队是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的，是林副主席直接领导的，是因为军队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治。工人同志对军队的期望，是希望我们发扬优良传统，在工厂中突出政治，帮助他们更好地活学活用毛主席著作。只有时时不忘突出政治，事事用毛泽东思想去教育群众，才能真正维护军队的崇高威信，从根本上满足群众对军队的期望。有的同志说：毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”。相信党，就是要相信毛泽东思想的威力；相信群众，就是要相信群众掌握了毛泽东思想，什么问题都能解决。我们几个人的作用是有限的，毛泽东思想的威力是无限的。用毛泽东思想去武装了工人的头脑，具体问题他们自己就能解决，而且可以比我们解决得更好。有的同志说：要维护军队的威信，满足群众的要求，唯一的途径就是坚定不移地突出政治，切实把组织工人群众活学活用毛主席著作，放到高于一切、大于一切、重于一切、先于一切的位置上来，千万不能本末倒置。
    谁是真正革命派，谁是假革命派、反革命派，应当由革命群众“裁判”
    还有一些同志进厂以后，没有充分开展政治思想工作，用毛泽东思想去教育群众，发动群众，对厂内各种群众组织之间的分歧、群众组织和革命群众之间的分歧，急于点头表态，忙于当“裁判”。他们说，毛主席号召军队积极支持革命左派，厂里的革命组织也迫切要求我们支持，我们不表态怎么行？在讨论中，大家认识到，工厂里各种派别很多，谁是真正革命派，谁是假革命派、反革命派，群众最了解，这个“裁判”应该由广大革命群众来当，靠几个宣传队员是当不了也当不好的。我们的任务是用毛泽东思想去武装工人群众，使他们擦亮眼睛，自己作出判断。不这样做，而是热中于当“裁判”，“裁”准了，也不能达到群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的目的；“裁”错了，那就更不好了。当然，我们应该对真正的革命左派积极地公开地表示支持。但是，只有用毛泽东思想武装了群众的头脑，到群众中去做了深入的调查研究，我们才能作出正确的判断，并且使这种支持具有群众基础。
    通过讨论，澄清了各种模糊认识。大家说，地方工作虽然和部队工作不同，用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，是完全相同的。地方工作虽然很复杂，可以说是千头万绪，但是突出政治，做好了人的思想工作，就能一通百通。大家表示，一定要更加坚定不移地突出政治，真正用毛泽东思想统帅革命，指挥生产，这样才能圆满完成毛主席交给军队的光荣任务。
    要进一步提高工人群众学习毛主席著作的自觉性
    怎样在支持左派、支援工业的工作中突出政治呢？参加毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，互相交流了经验。大家认为，当前特别要抓好以下三项工作。首先，要进一步提高工人群众学习毛主席著作的自觉性。大家体会到，在工人群众中掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮，光抓学习组织、学习制度是不够的，应当反复宣传林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的重要性的指示，使大家更加自觉地去活学活用。要向工人群众介绍部队活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫的经验。要联系工厂斗争实际，说明按照毛主席的指示办事，什么事情都能办好，不按毛主席的指示办事，什么事情也办不好。同时，要抓住工厂当前斗争中一两个重要问题，和工人群众一起带着问题学习毛主席著作，使工人群众从中尝到甜头，学到方法。许多毛泽东思想宣传队这样做了，工人群众学习毛主席著作的自觉性就大大提高。现在，已经有许多工厂的工人坚持班前学班后学，收到了立竿见影的效果。他们说：解放军帮助我们学习毛主席著作，真是帮到了点子上，这是最大的支持，最好的支持，最根本的支持。
    要大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召
    第二，要大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。大家认为，支援工业，首先要支持革命群众抓好革命，真正做到抓革命，促生产，以革命带动生产。要抓好革命，在当前就要用毛泽东思想扫除大联合、“三结合”的种种思想障碍，促进大联合、革命的“三结合”。到上海面粉厂去的毛泽东思想宣传队，发现面粉厂革命派内部存在小团体主义、关门主义、骄傲自满等错误思想，就同他们一起学习“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，使他们认识到改造主观世界的重要性，自觉地进行破私立公的思想斗争，热情地帮助他们开门整风。经过整风，革命派队伍迅速壮大起来。革命派的负责人感动地说：“解放军帮助我们整风，‘私’字整掉了，‘公’字增多了，队伍壮大了。”在实行革命的“三结合”过程中，宣传队同志同革命派负责人一起，学习了毛主席关于干部政策的论述和《红旗》杂志社论，帮助他们正确对待干部，同时积极做了革命干部的政治思想工作。全厂干部绝大部分站了出来，并且有五个革命领导干部参加了革命委员会的领导工作。革命群众和革命干部深有体会地说：“革命委员会的成立，是大家活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是毛泽东思想把我们结合起来了。”在革命委员会的领导下，面粉厂革命和生产的形势一天比一天好，三月份产量比二月份增长了百分之十一点四八，质量达到了百分之九十九点九五。
    宣传毛泽东思想，要和帮助工人解决具体问题结合起来
    第三，宣传毛泽东思想，要和帮助工人群众解决具体问题结合起来，通过具体问题抓根本。大家认为，学习毛主席著作，就要活学活用，联系实际，这才能立竿见影，取得成效。工厂里的各种具体问题，我们当然不能指手划脚，包办代替；但是，许多具体问题，是和当前斗争直接有关的，也不能完全撇开。如果不接触具体问题，只是进行一般的宣传，就不能真正达到用毛泽东思想武装工人群众的目的。
