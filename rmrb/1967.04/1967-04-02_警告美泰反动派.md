Once the Guam conference ended, U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom government of Thailand, brazenly announced that U.S. B-52 strategic bombers would be stationed at the Udon Thani air base in Thailand starting in early April and would take off from there to bomb Vietnam. This is a serious step by U.S. imperialism to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam.

U.S. imperialism thinks that by stationing a large number of B-52 strategic bombers in Thailand, it can reverse its losing situation in the Vietnam War. This is sheer delusion. In fact, U.S. imperialism has already used various types of aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, for indiscriminate bombing. However, this so-called "air superiority" has not changed its fate of losing more and more. Does placing a few B-52 strategic bombers in Thailand mean that the U.S. aggressors can turn defeat into victory? Of course not.

U.S. imperialism's attempt to achieve the goal of forcing Vietnam to surrender through war "escalation" is also in vain. The heroic Vietnamese people are not the kind to be frightened by U.S. bombs. On the contrary, the Vietnamese people will strike back with powerful combat actions against the U.S. aggressors. On March 31, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, issuing a stern warning to U.S. imperialism: the Vietnamese people will take necessary measures to deal with the aggressive war actions of the United States and its Thai lackeys. The Chinese people firmly support the just stance of the Vietnamese people.

U.S. imperialism has long used Thailand as a base to invade Vietnam and other countries in Indochina. U.S. planes have long taken off from Thailand to bomb Vietnam and Laos. It not only sends Thai mercenaries to the battlefields of South Vietnam but also directs the Thai reactionary government to repeatedly invade the Cambodian border. Now, U.S. imperialism is openly stationing B-52 strategic bombers in Thailand, which is a serious provocation to the peoples of Indochina and Southeast Asia. This new military adventurism by U.S. imperialism will certainly face strong resistance and severe punishment from the peoples of Asian countries.

The Thanom clique, by bringing in U.S. B-52 strategic bombers, not only threatens the security of the peoples of various Asian countries but also threatens the security of the Thai people. Thanom shamelessly claims that U.S. military bases are "guaranteeing" Thailand's "security," which is sheer deception. The Thai reactionary government, acting as a tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression, is making enemies of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia, which can only lead to its own destruction.

    警告美泰反动派
    关岛会议一结束，美帝国主义和它的走狗泰国他侬政府就悍然宣布：美国B—52型战略轰炸机将在四月初进驻泰国乌塔保空军基地，并从那里起飞轰炸越南。这是美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的一个严重步骤。
    美帝国主义以为把大批B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国，就能够挽救它在侵越战争中的败局，这完全是痴心妄想。事实上，美帝国主义早就使用了包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的各种飞机进行狂轰滥炸，但是美帝国主义的这种所谓“空中优势”并没有能够改变它越输越惨的命运。难道在泰国摆上几架B—52型战略轰炸机，就能够使美国侵略者转败为胜吗？当然不能。
    美帝国主义妄想用这种战争“升级”的罪恶行动来达到对越南人民“以战迫降”的目的，更是枉费心机。英雄的越南人民决不是美国炸弹所能吓得倒的，相反，越南人民将以有力的战斗行动狠狠地打击美国侵略者。越南民主共和国外交部三月三十一日发表声明，对美帝国主义提出了严厉的警告：越南人民将采取必要的措施对付美国及其泰国走狗的侵略战争行动。中国人民坚决支持越南人民的严正立场。
    美帝国主义一直利用泰国作为侵略越南和印度支那各国的基地。美国飞机早就从泰国起飞轰炸越南和老挝。它不仅把泰国的雇佣军用于南越战场，而且指使泰国反动政府不断侵犯柬埔寨边境。现在，美帝国主义又公然把B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国，这是对印度支那和东南亚各国人民的严重挑衅。美帝国主义这一新的军事冒险行动，必将遭到亚洲各国人民的强烈反抗和严厉的惩罚。
    他侬集团把美国的B—52型战略轰炸机引进泰国，不仅威胁亚洲各国人民的安全，也威胁泰国人民的安全。他侬居然恬不知耻地说什么美国的军事基地是“保障”泰国的“安全”，这完全是骗人的鬼话。泰国反动政府，死心塌地充当美帝国主义的侵略工具，与越南人民和亚洲人民为敌，这只能是自取灭亡。
