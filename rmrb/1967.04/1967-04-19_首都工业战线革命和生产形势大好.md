The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people are rising up to criticize the number one capitalist-road element within the Party, and are launching a new revolutionary upsurge to thoroughly smash the old Beijing Municipal Committee and to thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences of the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, our reporter comments: The proletarian revolutionaries fighting on the front lines of the capital, with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held high, are resolutely criticizing the number one capitalist-road element within the Party. They are resolutely eliminating the poisonous influences of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They resolutely put proletarian politics in command, use revolution to lead production, and strive to be the most outstanding model in executing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, the industrial front in the capital is presenting a great situation of dual victories in revolution and production.

In the first quarter, the revolutionary and production situation in the city improved month by month. The industrial production level for the entire quarter increased by 6% compared to the same period last year. In March, an even better situation emerged, with production levels increasing by 21% compared to February.

The great situation in the capital's industrial production is the result of the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the result of the heroic struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and the result of the People's Liberation Army's strong support for the proletarian revolutionaries and industrial production work.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries in the capital have launched a fierce attack on the bastions of the bourgeoisie. Since January this year, they have waged a resolute struggle to seize power from a small handful of capitalist-road elements within the Party. In some factories, mines, and enterprises where power has been seized by the proletarian revolutionaries, the socialist revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity hidden within the masses have erupted like a volcano. A small handful of capitalist-road elements within the Party, in order to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and save their dying fate, have incited some deceived workers to leave their production posts, attempting to bring production to a standstill. During these tense days, many revolutionary workers, after finishing their day shifts, would go on to night shifts, taking on the heaviest and most arduous production tasks. They proudly declared, "Even if the sky falls, we will prop it up; even if the earth sinks, we will fill it in!" Some factory and workshop revolutionaries completed two-thirds of the month's production tasks in just six or seven days. At the same time, they consciously strove to improve product quality, pay attention to saving resources, and fight against the phenomenon of neglecting product quality and wasting state property.

Just as the proletarian revolutionaries were engaged in a decisive battle with a small handful of capitalist-road elements within the Party, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" was published. The call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee made the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the capital's factories, mines, and enterprises even more determined in their forward march. The convening of the Capital Workers' Congress, the gathering of the proletarian revolutionaries from all factories, mines, and enterprises across the city under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, made their fighting spirit even more soaring. Especially since March, the People's Liberation Army has resolutely responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, sending a large number of cadres to factories, mines, and enterprises to actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have supported the proletarian revolutionaries in factories, mines, and enterprises politically and ideologically, making the revolutionary and production situation on the capital's industrial front increasingly better.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not avoid problems but solve them with an active attitude, any difficulty in the world can be overcome." This is an unshakable truth. Through the arduous struggle of the proletarian revolutionary workers and the broad masses, tasks that were originally thought to be impossible to complete were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. New records are constantly emerging. The proletarian revolutionaries in the capital have used their actual actions to deal a heavy blow to the small handful of capitalist-road elements within the Party who conspired to sabotage production, and have refuted those bourgeois gentlemen who stood by and waited to see the joke. In the last few days of late March, the statistical tables filled out by the statisticians showed that the production level for the entire month compared to the previous month increased by one figure after another, from an estimated increase of 14% to a final increase of 21%. This figure shines with the invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought, showing the boundless enthusiasm and wisdom of the proletarian revolutionaries in the capital, and foreshadowing that after the proletarian revolutionaries truly seize the reins of production, socialist construction will enter an extraordinarily high-speed stage.

Are our factories, mines, and enterprises advancing on the socialist path pointed out by Chairman Mao, or are they sliding down the capitalist and revisionist path? This is an extremely important issue related to the success or failure of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers and cadres in the industrial departments of Beijing have exposed with a large number of facts that the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee used industry as their important base. When they usurped the leadership of Beijing, they implemented a revisionist line that was anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought in the industrial departments. They resisted Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle in socialist society, opposed taking class struggle as the key link, opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, and attempted to achieve a peaceful evolution. They vigorously opposed revolutionary workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and as soon as they saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, they opposed it, cursed it, and raged against it. They opposed Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "industry learns from Daqing" and put forward the so-called "eliteism" that equipment determines everything and the so-called "qualityism" that quality determines everything, which is a thorough revisionist program. They stipulated that the workers' tasks were "first production, second production, third still production." They implemented material incentives and money as the commander in factories, mines, and enterprises. They followed the expert path in enterprise management and opposed mobilizing the masses. They relied on a large number of institutions and very complicated regulations to implement a bourgeois "tutelage-style" leadership over the masses of workers. They did not start from the needs of the state and the people, but pursued the so-called "high, precise, and advanced," seeking political capital for themselves and wantonly wasting the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the state. They promoted localism, separatism, and championshipism, and continuously added "black projects" in industrial production and scientific research, disrupting the state plan. In enterprise operations, they pursued profits one-sidedly, attempting to turn socialist public ownership into small group ownership, that is, capitalist ownership. In the industrial departments, they formed cliques and factions, recruited traitors, and acted as loyal running dogs for the implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee persisted in the capitalist path in the industrial departments, persecuted revolutionary workers, and sabotaged production, committing countless crimes. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in the industrial departments of Beijing have long resisted and fought against this counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. They have unlimited love for Chairman Mao, support the Party Central Committee, and have done a lot of work according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Municipal Committee. The proletarian revolutionaries in the factories, mines, and enterprises of the capital, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, united the broad masses after seizing power, and held high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, they resolutely smashed the old systems that shackled the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in factories, mines, and enterprises, resolutely smashed the bureaucratic old rules and customs, and resolutely smashed everything that hindered the development of socialist production, gradually establishing a new and good revolutionary order.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres deeply feel in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that Mao Zedong Thought is the commander, the soul, the lifeline, and the guiding light for them to advance in the surging waves of class struggle. They put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place and let Mao Zedong Thought command everything. They strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to observe everything, analyze everything, and transform everything, and have formed a trend in many enterprises' proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses.

In some factories and workshops, under the same material conditions such as machinery and equipment, some production and technical problems that could not be solved by relying on high bonuses or compulsory penalties in the past are now solved smoothly by relying on the thought revolution of the people and Mao Zedong Thought as the commander in people's minds.

In some enterprises where power has been seized and well grasped by the proletarian revolutionaries, the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions are also used in production. Everyone manages production, everyone comes up with ideas, and everyone takes the initiative to act, "the more people discuss, the more enthusiasm, the more energy." There are many talents among the people, and as long as the problem is handed over to the people, the solution will come out.

In the past, some enterprise leaders sat in the office listening to reports, demanding figures, seeing only things and not people, rarely participating in labor among the masses, and having no idea about the production situation. This old habit has been severely criticized this time. The revolutionary "three-in-one" production leadership teams in enterprises implement the principle of streamlining and efficiency, with most members not being full-time, and some even setting up their "desks" in the production teams to lead production on the production site. They are both managers of production and ordinary laborers. They often hear the opinions of the workers, discover problems quickly, and solve them quickly. A brand-new leadership style and a brand-new relationship between leaders and the led are beginning to emerge.

Currently, the pace of grasping revolution and promoting production is not balanced in various industrial departments and factories, mines, and enterprises in the capital. In some enterprises, a small handful of capitalist-road elements within the Party are not willing to admit defeat. They are colluding with ghosts and snakes, launching a counterattack against the proletarian revolutionaries, and stirring up a counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism. The revolutionary workers and the broad masses in all factories, mines, and enterprises across the city are rising up to criticize the number one capitalist-road element within the Party, and are gradually combining this criticism movement with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions, departments, and units. A new revolutionary upsurge to thoroughly smash the old Beijing Municipal Committee and to thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences of the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is rising. In this great situation, the proletarian revolutionaries in the capital are determined to redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and are determined to achieve dual victories in revolution and production.

    毛主席身边的工人阶级在解放军支持下，狠抓革命猛促生产
    首都工业战线革命和生产形势大好
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众正在奋起批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，掀起彻底摧毁旧北京市委、彻底肃清旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线一切流毒的革命新高潮。
    据新华社十八日讯　本社记者述评：战斗在毛主席身边的首都工人阶级，以无产阶级革命派的大无畏精神，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，坚决肃清旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的流毒，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们坚决突出无产阶级政治，以革命统帅生产，力争在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，成为执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的最出色的模范。当前，首都的工业战线正呈现一派革命、生产双胜利的大好形势。
    第一季度，全市革命和生产形势一个月比一个月好。全季工业生产水平比去年同期增长百分之六。三月份，更出现了一片大好形势，生产水平比二月份增长百分之二十一。
    首都工业生产形势大好，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的结果，是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在毛主席和党中央领导下英勇斗争的结果，是人民解放军大力支持无产阶级革命派和支持工业生产工作的结果。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，首都无产阶级革命派职工向资产阶级反动堡垒发起了猛烈的总攻击，今年一月以来又向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了坚决的夺权斗争。在一些已经由无产阶级革命派夺权并掌了权的厂矿企业里，蕴藏在群众中的社会主义革命积极性和创造力，就象火山一样迸发出来。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了破坏无产阶级文化大革命，以挽救他们垂死的命运，挑动一些受蒙蔽的职工离开生产岗位，妄图使生产陷于停顿。在这些紧张的日子里，许多革命工人上完日班上夜班，争担最繁重艰巨的生产任务。他们豪迈地说：“天塌下来我们能顶住，地陷下去我们能填平！”有些工厂、车间的革命职工，竟在六、七天的时间里，就完成了全月三分之二的生产任务。同时，他们还自觉地力争提高产品质量，注意节约，同忽视产品质量、浪费国家财产的现象进行斗争。
    正当无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行决战的关键时刻，《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表了。毛主席和党中央的号召，使首都厂矿企业无产阶级革命派广大职工更加坚定了前进的方向。首都工代会的召开，全市厂矿企业无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下的大会师，使他们斗志更加昂扬。特别是三月份以来，人民解放军坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，派出大批干部深入厂矿企业，积极宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，从政治上、思想上支援厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派，使首都工业战线的革命和生产形势越来越好。
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”这是一条颠扑不破的真理。经过无产阶级革命派职工和广大群众的艰苦奋斗，原来预计无法完成的任务，提前超额完成了，创纪录的新水平在不断出现。首都工人阶级用自己的实际行动，给那些阴谋破坏生产的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以沉重的打击，给了那些呆在一边等着看笑话的资产阶级老爷们以有力的驳斥。三月下旬的最后几天，统计人员填写的全月比上个月生产水平增长的预计表上，一天一个样，由预计增长百分之十四，一直跳到百分之二十一。这个数字，闪烁着战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉，显示了首都工人阶级的冲天干劲和无穷的智慧，预示着在无产阶级革命派把生产大权真正掌握在自己手里之后，社会主义建设就会出现一个异乎寻常的高速度。　
    我们的厂矿企业，是按照毛主席指出的社会主义道路前进，还是沿着资本主义、修正主义的道路滑下去？这是关系到我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设成败的极其重要的问题。在无产阶级文化大革命中，北京工业部门广大职工、干部用大量事实揭发出，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团把工业作为他们的重要基地，在他们窃踞北京市领导权的时候，在工业部门中推行了一条反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的修正主义路线。他们抗拒毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的教导，反对以阶级斗争为纲，反对突出无产阶级政治，妄图实现和平演变。他们竭力反对革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，一见到毛泽东思想的巨大威力就反对，就咒骂，就暴跳如雷。他们反对毛主席提出的“工业学大庆”的伟大战略方针，提出了设备决定一切的所谓“精兵主义”和质量决定一切的所谓“精品主义”这个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领。他们规定工人的任务“第一是生产，第二是生产，第三还是生产。”他们在厂矿企业大搞物质刺激，金钱挂帅。他们在企业管理上走专家路线，反对放手发动群众。他们依靠庞大的机构和十分繁琐的规章制度，对职工群众实行资产阶级的“训政”式领导。他们不从国家和人民群众的需要出发，片面追求所谓“高、精、尖”，为自己捞取政治资本，恣意浪费国家的人力、物力、财力。他们大搞地方主义、分散主义、锦标主义，在工业生产和科学研究中不断追加“黑项目”，破坏国家计划。他们在企业经营上片面追求利润，企图把社会主义全民所有制变成小团体所有制，即资本主义所有制。他们在工业部门结党营私，招降纳叛，作为推行反革命修正主义路线的忠实走卒。
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团在工业部门坚持资本主义道路，迫害革命职工，破坏生产，罪行累累。北京市工业部门广大革命职工、革命干部，长期以来对旧北京市委这一条反革命修正主义路线进行了抵制和斗争。他们无限热爱毛主席，拥护党中央，按照毛主席和党中央的指示做了很多工作。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他们就向旧市委的反革命修正主义路线发起猛攻。首都厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派，以彻底革命的精神，在夺权之后团结广大群众，高高举起无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为最锐利的武器，坚决摧毁厂矿企业里束缚广大群众积极性和创造力的旧制度，坚决摧毁官僚主义的陈规陋习，坚决摧毁一切妨碍社会主义生产发展的东西，逐步建立起新的良好的革命秩序。
    广大革命职工、革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中越来越深切地体会到：毛泽东思想是统帅，是灵魂，是命根子，是指导自己在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中前进的指路明灯。他们把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，让毛泽东思想统帅一切。努力学习毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想去观察一切，分析一切，改造一切，在许多企业的无产阶级革命派和广大群众中已形成风气。
    一些工厂车间在机器设备等物质条件不变的情况下，过去依靠高额奖励或强制惩罚的办法未能解决的一些生产技术难题，现在依靠人的思想革命化，依靠毛泽东思想在人的头脑里挂帅，顺利地解决了。
    在一些已经由无产阶级革命派夺权并很好地掌了权的企业里，大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的武器也用到了生产上。生产上的事，大家都管，大家都出主意，大家都自觉动手，“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”群众里面人材多得很，有了问题一向群众交底，办法就出来了。
    过去，一些企业的领导干部坐在办公室里听汇报，要数字，只见物，不见人，很少深入群众参加劳动，对生产状况心中无数的旧习惯，这次遭到了无情的批判。企业里革命的“三结合”的生产领导班子，实行精兵简政的原则，成员大部分不脱产，有的就把“办公桌”设在生产班组，在生产现场领导生产。他们既是生产的管理者，又是普通的劳动者。他们经常听到工人的意见，有问题发现得快，解决得快。一种崭新的领导作风，一种崭新的领导与被领导的关系，开始出现了。
    目前，首都各个工业部门，各个厂矿企业之间，抓革命促生产的步伐还不平衡。在一些企业里，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派还不甘心失败，他们正勾结牛鬼蛇神，向无产阶级革命派反扑，兴起一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流。全市厂矿企业革命派职工和广大群众，正在奋起批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，同时正逐步把这个批判运动和本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来。一个彻底摧毁旧北京市委，彻底肃清旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线一切流毒的新的革命高潮，正在兴起。在这个大好形势下，首都工人阶级决心更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
