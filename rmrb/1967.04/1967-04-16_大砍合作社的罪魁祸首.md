The chief culprit behind the frenzied opposition to agricultural collectivization, the slashing of cooperatives, and the opposition to our poor and lower-middle peasants taking the socialist road is the top capitalist-roader in the Party. We resolutely overthrow him!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The cooperative is the only way for the poor to become rich." We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and actively respond to his great call, resolutely taking the socialist road. In the autumn of 1954, we twelve poor and lower-middle peasants actively discussed establishing an agricultural production cooperative. Everyone was enthusiastic and determined. However, the higher-ups would not approve it. Some rich peasants also mocked us: "Beggars starting a cooperative, what can they achieve? Can a chicken feather fly to the sky?" Faced with this situation, we unanimously agreed that starting a cooperative is responding to Chairman Mao's call and taking the socialist road. Approval or no approval, we must do it. We "beggars" must make the chicken feather fly to the sky! When sowing wheat, we had no livestock, so men, women, old, and young all went out to turn the soil with hoes; we had no money to buy fertilizer, so we collected rough manure. With self-reliance, we achieved a bumper harvest of 37 mu of wheat, with a yield far exceeding that of the individual farmers who had mocked us. That summer, we not only delivered patriotic grain but also increased our income. The cooperative also acquired a head of livestock and some farm tools. At this point, we thought that our second application would surely be approved. Who would have thought that our two consecutive applications were not approved. Thus, we carried the black hat of a "private cooperative" for more than a year. In July 1955, Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" was published. It was like a thunderclap, clearing away the clouds and revealing the sun. Our cooperative was approved by Chairman Mao.

But who was it that opposed our taking the socialist road? Who was it that did not approve our starting a cooperative? Who was it that labeled us with the black hat of a "private cooperative"? The enemy has a head, and the debt has a master. Now we finally understand that it was this top capitalist-roader in the Party who opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fiercely opposed agricultural collectivization, and slashed cooperatives.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The top capitalist-roader in the Party opposes our taking the socialist road, but we insist on taking the socialist road. We will forever follow our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and carry the revolution through to the end!

    大砍合作社的罪魁祸首
    河南省贫下中农代表大会代表、劳动模范
    沁阳县城关公社北金村大队党支部书记  朱广法
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是疯狂反对农业合作化，大砍合作社，反对我们贫下中农走社会主义道路的罪魁祸首。我们坚决打倒他！
    毛主席教导我们：合作社是“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决走社会主义道路。在一九五四年秋季，我们十二户贫下中农就积极酝酿成立一个农业生产合作社。大家的劲头很高，决心很大。可是，就是上边批不准。一些富裕农民也讥笑我们：“穷光蛋办社，搞不出啥名堂。鸡毛还能上天吗？”面对这种情况，我们一致认为，办社是响应毛主席的号召，是走社会主义道路，批准要干，批不准也要干。我们“穷光蛋”非叫鸡毛上天不可！种麦时，耕地没牲口，我们就男女老少一齐出动，用锨翻；没钱买肥料，就积粗肥。我们终于以自力更生的精神，夺取了三十七亩小麦的大丰收，产量大大超过了那些原来讥笑我们的单干户。那年夏季，我们不仅交售了爱国粮，而且户户增加了收入，社里也添置了一头牲口和一些农具。这时，我们满以为再次申请，准能批准。谁知道我们接连申请了两次，都没得到批准。这样，我们一直背了一年多“私社”的黑锅。一九五五年七月，毛主席的光辉著作《关于农业合作化问题》发表了。真是一声霹雷震天响，拨开云雾见太阳。我们的合作社被毛主席批准了。
    可是，反对我们走社会主义道路的是谁呢？不批准我们办合作社的是谁呢？给我们扣上“私社”这个黑锅的又是谁呢？冤有头，债有主，现在我们才搞清楚，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，疯狂反对农业合作化，大砍合作社的，原来就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反对我们走社会主义道路，我们偏要走社会主义道路。我们要永远跟着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席革命到底！
