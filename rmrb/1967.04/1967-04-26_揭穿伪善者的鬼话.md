Recently, we had the "pleasure" of reading a piece by the Soviet revisionist historian, Vice-Doctor Karamyshev, published in the *Soviet Russia* newspaper. In this article, he donned the mask of a "philanthropist," suddenly expressing concern for the lives of the Chinese people. He depicted the counter-revolutionary economic opportunism of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries as "not considering the reasonable interests of the laboring people," claiming that China is now facing "serious economic difficulties" and that "there is nothing in the market," and so on. Look, how this Vice-Doctor is just like the imperialists who run "orphanages," how concerned he is for the Chinese people! Not only that, he also boasted about how the Soviet revisionists "care about improving the material conditions of the people." This is utterly ridiculous.

Vice-Doctor, put away your tricks. The Chinese people have already experienced the "concern" shown by the Soviet revisionist leadership. Everyone remembers what the Soviets did when our country suffered natural disasters. They suddenly withdrew a large number of Soviet experts using surprise attacks, unilaterally tearing up hundreds of agreements and contracts. They used these despicable means to try to sabotage our socialist construction and force us to follow their directives. All the revolutionary people of the world saw this clearly. We have long seen through your so-called "concern." The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never be intimidated by difficulties. We have developed our economy at an unprecedented speed with the spirit of self-reliance. This is evident to all the people of the world. Currently, in response to Chairman Mao's great call, our people are seizing the revolution and promoting production. With the victory of the Cultural Revolution, the national economy is showing a great situation. The lives of our people do not need your concern at all! Here, we advise the "philanthropist" Karamyshev to mind your own business at home!

Vice-Doctor, you brazenly boast about how the Soviet revisionist leadership is the most concerned about improving the lives of the people. Now let us expose your tricks!

Since the revisionist clique of Khrushchev usurped the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, they turned the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. They carried out capitalist restoration at home, destroyed the socialist economic foundation of the Soviet Union, and brought endless suffering to the lives of the Soviet people. The new leadership of Brezhnev and Kosygin, who took power after Khrushchev, went even further and did even worse. You promoted material incentives, shamelessly advocating that "money makes everything possible," even advocating that "one should learn to respect the ruble" and "should unconditionally respect high salaries." What you promote is nothing but the worship of money.

To accelerate the restoration of capitalism, in recent years, you have been vigorously promoting the new economic "system" with capitalist profit principles at its core. You use various measures to encourage enterprises, farms, and farms to pursue profits, implementing free operation and free trade. The results of these "typical experiments" over the past few years show that this so-called "new system" has brought even more serious consequences to the Soviet economy, causing serious chaos in production and destroying the planned nature of social production. In agriculture, you also promoted material incentives, seriously destroying agricultural production. According to the Soviet State Statistical Bureau, many industrial enterprises did not complete their production plans in the first nine months of last year. The director of the Soviet Grain and Cultivation Bureau also admitted: "In the past seven years, the grain problem has not been solved at all. Therefore, there is still a severe shortage of grain." To say nothing of the past, according to your recent publications, daily necessities are in short supply in the Soviet Union. In the republics of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Armenia, to meet the demand for daily necessities, a large number of goods have to be transported from far away. There is also a severe shortage of food. In many regions of the Soviet Union, there are few sales of eggplants, peppers, and lettuce; tomatoes and cucumbers are in short supply. The Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade also had to admit that in the past ten years, imported clothing has increased by forty-six times, imported shoes by twenty-three times, and imported vegetables and fruits by more than five times. Your so-called "new system" is actually living on imported foreign goods. How pathetic! In such a situation, to say that the lives of the broad masses of Soviet laborers can be "improved," is that not a lie?

Vice-Doctor, you boast about being concerned with "improving the material conditions of the people." Well, let us see who you are really concerned about and whose lives you have improved. The various measures you have taken to restore capitalism have only given the privileged classes greater rights to exploit, further developing the high-wage system for a few people, thereby accelerating class differentiation and making the rich and poor even more unequal. Take wages as an example. Those high officials, "celebrities," "scholars," "experts," and "authorities," and other new bourgeois elements, with their monthly wages plus various "allowances," "bonuses," "double salaries," and "academic wages," earn thousands of rubles, while an ordinary worker only earns seventy or eighty rubles, and waiters and cleaners only thirty or forty rubles. Even bonuses are distributed according to wage ratios, with the vast majority going into the pockets of enterprise leaders. It is the same in the countryside. Those privileged class figures earn thousands of rubles a month, and their wages account for almost half of the farm's remuneration fund; while an ordinary farm member only earns thirty or forty rubles. Workers and farmers work hard all day, but they only fatten these non-laboring exploiters and parasites.

What is even more serious is that the broad masses of Soviet laborers are not only economically exploited by the Soviet revisionist privileged classes but also suffer various persecutions, and their work and life are not guaranteed. The Soviet revisionist leadership, through the implementation of the so-called new economic "system," expanded the power of enterprise and farm privileged elements, allowing them to arbitrarily dismiss workers and deduct wages, doing whatever they want. For example, five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad dismissed more than two hundred employees in five months. For example, some farm leaders can "arbitrarily use fines, reduce courtyard gardens, and even dismiss workers" to punish farm members.

The Soviet revisionist leadership claims that the Soviet Union is transitioning to "communism." In your country, such a shocking phenomenon of polarization has appeared. Is this a transition to communism or a retreat to capitalism? Isn't it clear?

Karamyshev also maliciously slandered our Cultural Revolution as the "logic of revolutionary enemies," the "logic of traitors to Marxism-Leninism," and the "logic of those who betray their own people." We return these words to you and your masters, which is most appropriate. You have betrayed Lenin, betrayed the Soviet people, you have accelerated the restoration of capitalism, turned a good socialist power into a mess, caused economic difficulties, and made the people's lives miserable, which no lie can cover up. The facts prove that those who implement the "logic of revolutionary enemies," those who implement the "logic of traitors to Marxism-Leninism," and those who implement the "logic of those who betray their own people" are not us, but precisely you yourselves!

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Opportunists who try to block the tide may be found almost everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable. Socialism is advancing to victory everywhere, leaving all obstacles behind." We firmly believe that history will eventually teach this Vice-Doctor of history and his masters a lesson. The Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will one day push the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track and kick out the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and their lackeys like Karamyshev!

    揭穿伪善者的鬼话
    清华大学“井冈山”兵团　红勇兵
    前不久，我们“拜读”了苏修历史学副博士卡拉梅谢夫在《苏维埃俄罗斯报》上写的一篇“大作”。他在这里摆出一副“慈善家”的面孔，忽然关心起中国人民的生活来了。他把中国无产阶级革命派反击反革命经济主义的猖狂进攻，说成是“不考虑劳动人民的合理利益”，说什么现在中国的“经济发生严重困难”，“市场上什么也没有”，等等。请看，这位副博士先生多么象帝国主义开办“育婴堂”的“慈善家”，是何等“关心”中国人民呀！不仅如此，他还煞有介事地吹嘘苏修是如何如何“关心改善人民的物质状况”的。简直是滑天下之大稽。
    副博士先生，快收起你的那一套鬼花招吧。中国人民对苏修领导集团所给予我们的“关心”，早就领教过了。人们记忆犹新，在我国遭受自然灾害的时候，你们苏修到底干了些什么！你们用突然袭击的办法，擅自撤走了大批苏联专家，背信弃义地撕毁了几百个协定和合同。你们使用这种卑劣的手段，妄图破坏我国的社会主义建设，妄图迫使我们屈从你们的指挥棒。所有这些，全世界革命人民是看得明明白白的。我们早就看透了你们的所谓“关心”是什么货色！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是绝不会被困难所吓倒的，我们发扬了自力更生的精神，以空前未有的速度，发展了经济。这是全世界人民有目共睹的。目前，我们全国人民响应毛主席的伟大号召，正在抓革命，促生产。随着文化大革命的胜利发展，全国经济呈现出一派大好形势。我国人民的生活，完全用不着你们来操心！在这里，我们倒要奉劝“慈善家”卡拉梅谢夫先生，你还是关心你们自己国内的事情去吧！
    副博士先生，你不是大言不惭地吹嘘什么苏修领导集团是最关心改善人民生活的吗？现在让我们拆穿你们的西洋镜来瞧瞧吧！
    自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权以后，把无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政，在国内大搞资本主义复辟，破坏苏联社会主义经济基础，给苏联人民生活带来说不尽的苦难。以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修新领导上台后，比赫鲁晓夫走得更远，搞得更糟。你们大搞物质刺激，大肆鼓吹“有了卢布就有了一切”，甚至无耻地提倡“应当学会尊重卢布”，“应当无条件地尊重特高工资”，你们宣扬的完全是金钱拜物教。
    为了加速复辟资本主义，近几年来，你们加紧推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的经济“新体制”。以各种措施鼓励企业、农庄和农场追逐利润，实行自由经营、自由买卖。这几年的“典型试验”表明，这种所谓“新体制”已经给苏联的经济带来了更加严重的恶果，造成生产上的严重混乱，破坏了社会生产的计划性。你们在农业方面也推行了物质刺激这一套，严重地破坏了农业生产。据苏联国家统计局公布，许多工业企业去年九个月没有完成生产计划。苏联谷物和耕作业总管理局长也不打自招地供认：“在过去七年内，粮食问题远远没有解决。因此，现在仍然感到粮食极为缺乏”。远的不说，就据你们最近的报刊透露，苏联生活日用品奇缺。在塔吉克斯坦、土库曼和亚美尼亚等加盟共和国，为了满足对日用杂品的需要，只好把大量商品从远地运来。副食品也缺得惊人。苏联很多地区很少出售茄子、辣椒、莴苣；西红柿和黄瓜供应不足。苏联外贸部长也不得不承认，近十年来，进口服装增加了四十六倍，进口鞋子增加了二十三倍，进口蔬菜和水果增加了五倍多。你们的所谓“新体制”原来就是靠进口外国商品过活。那真是太可悲了！而在这样的情况下，说什么苏联广大劳动人民的生活能得到“改善”，那不是骗人的鬼话又是什么？
    副博士先生，你们自吹是“关心改善人民的物质状况”的。那末，我们来看一看，你们究竟关心的是谁，你们究竟改善了谁的生活。你们采取的种种复辟资本主义的经济措施，其结果无非是赋予特权阶层以更大的剥削权利，更加发展了对少数人的高薪制度，从而加速了阶级分化，使贫富更加悬殊。拿工资为例，那些达官贵人，“名流学者”，“专家”“权威”等等新资产阶级分子，每月工资再加上名目繁多的“津贴”、“奖金”、“兼薪”、“学位工资”等等，收入高达数千卢布，而一个普通工人只有七、八十卢布，服务员、清洁工等则仅有三、四十卢布。即使是奖励金也是按工资比例分配，绝大部分都到了企业领导人的口袋里。在农村里也是这样。那些特权阶层人物每月工资上千卢布，他们的工资几乎占了农庄报酬基金的一半；而一个普通庄员才三、四十个卢布。工人、农民辛苦劳动终日，却养肥了这批不劳而获的剥削者、寄生虫。
    更严重的是，广大的苏联劳动人民不但在经济上受到苏修特权阶层的层层剥削，而且还受到了种种迫害，工作和生活也得不到可靠的保障。苏修领导集团通过施行所谓经济“新体制”，扩大企业和农庄特权分子的实权，使他们可以随意解雇工人、克扣工资，胡作非为。譬如，莫斯科和列宁格勒的五家汽车公司，五个月里就裁减了二百几十个工作人员。再譬如，一些农庄领导人，可以“擅自采用罚款、削减宅旁园地，以至撤销工作”等手段惩罚庄员。
    苏修领导集团不是口口声声宣称苏联正在向“共产主义”过渡吗？在你们的国家里出现了这样触目惊心的两极分化现象，这究竟是在向共产主义过渡，还是在向资本主义倒退，不是一清二楚的吗？
    卡拉梅谢夫还恶毒地诬蔑我国的文化大革命是“革命敌人的逻辑”，“马克思列宁主义的叛徒的逻辑”，“出卖自己人民的利益的人的逻辑”。我们把这几句话奉还给你和你的主子们倒是最合适不过的了。你们背叛了列宁，背叛了苏联人民，你们加速复辟资本主义，把一个好端端的社会主义强国，弄得一塌糊涂，造成经济困难，人民生活困苦，这是任何谎言也掩盖不了的。事实证明，实行“革命敌人的逻辑”的，实行“马克思列宁主义的叛徒的逻辑”的，实行“出卖自己人民的利益的人的逻辑”的，不是我们，而恰恰是你们自己！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”我们深信，历史终究会教训这位历史学副博士和他的主子们的。有着光荣革命传统的苏联人民，总有一天会把苏联重新推上社会主义的轨道，而把苏修统治集团及其走卒卡拉梅谢夫之流一脚踢开！
