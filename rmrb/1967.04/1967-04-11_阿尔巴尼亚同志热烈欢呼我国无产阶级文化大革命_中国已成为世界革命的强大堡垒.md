Albanian Comrades Warmly Hail China's Proletarian Cultural Revolution
China Has Become a Mighty Bastion of World Revolution

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 8th, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association's organ, the magazine "November," and playwright Ibrahim Uruçi, who recently visited China, delivered a report on his visit to China to Albanian cultural and artistic circles in Tirana. He warmly praised China's proletarian cultural revolution.

	He said that during his visit to China, he lived in an atmosphere of victory for the proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved great victories. The Chinese people love and respect the great leader and outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, without limit. Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people. He leads the Chinese people in exposing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and revisionists and in rooting out the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

	Uruçi highly praised the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. He said that at present, Chinese youth, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are smashing all old reactionary things, from breaking old customs and habits to engaging in struggles for power. The active participation of Chinese youth in the proletarian cultural revolution is of great significance to the fate of China's socialist cause, because they will be tempered in the revolutionary movement to become a new generation and ensure that the revolutionary baton is passed on from generation to generation. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries have slandered the Red Guards to the utmost because the Red Guards have burned them to a crisp with their revolutionary fire, because their dream of restoring capitalism in China has been shattered, and because China is increasingly becoming a mighty bastion of world revolution.

	In his report, Uruçi introduced the situation of the struggle between the two lines on China's cultural front. He said that we have seen with our own eyes that China is creating a new proletarian and revolutionary literature and art. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers have created revolutionary modern plays such as "The Red Lantern" and "The Red Detachment of Women," which have achieved great success and powerfully struck at the literature and art of the feudal class, the bourgeoisie, and modern revisionism.

	Uruçi said that we have never seen culture and art spread so widely among the people as it is now in China. In the field of literature and art, a great mass movement has emerged. The people, on the one hand, study the quotations of Chairman Mao and the works of Chairman Mao, and on the other hand, fight against anti-party elements, revisionist elements, and bourgeois elements and seize power. The people enthusiastically sing the praises of the great Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, showing their new artistic talent.

    阿尔巴尼亚同志热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命
    中国已成为世界革命的强大堡垒
    据新华社地拉那八日电　不久前访问过中国的阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会机关刊物《十一月》杂志副总编辑、剧作家易卜拉欣·乌鲁奇最近在地拉那向阿尔巴尼亚文化艺术界人士作访华报告时，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    他说，他在中国访问期间，一直生活在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利气氛中。毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线取得了巨大的胜利。中国人民都无限热爱、无限尊敬伟大领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志。毛泽东同志是中国人民的救星，他领导中国人民揭露了资产阶级、修正主义的反动路线，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    乌鲁奇高度赞扬红卫兵的革命行动。他说，目前，中国青年正在毛泽东思想的指导下，粉碎一切旧的反动东西，从打破旧的风俗习惯，直到进行夺权斗争。中国青年积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，对于中国的社会主义事业的命运具有重大的意义，因为他们将在革命运动中锻炼成为新的一代，保证把革命的接力棒一代一代地传下去。帝国主义、修正主义和反动派对红卫兵极尽诬蔑之能事，因为红卫兵以其革命烈火把他们烧得焦头烂额，因为他们企图在中国复辟资本主义的幻想破灭了，因为中国日益成为世界革命的强大堡垒。
    乌鲁奇在报告中介绍了中国文艺战线上两条道路的斗争情况。他说，我们亲眼看到，中国正在创造出无产阶级的、革命的新文艺。革命的文艺工作者已经创作出《红灯记》、《红色娘子军》等革命现代戏，这些现代戏取得了巨大的成功，有力地打击了封建阶级、资产阶级和现代修正主义的文艺。
    乌鲁奇说，我们从来没有看到过文化艺术象现在中国这样在人民群众中得到广泛传播。在文艺领域中出现了伟大的群众运动。人民群众一方面学习毛主席语录和毛主席的著作，一方面同反党分子、修正主义分子和资产阶级分子进行斗争，进行夺权。人民群众热情地歌颂伟大的中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志，表现了他们的新的文艺天才。
