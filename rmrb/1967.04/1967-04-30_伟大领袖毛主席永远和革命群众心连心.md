The film truthfully records the great historical fact of our great leader Chairman Mao, at a crucial moment in the struggle between the two lines, once again inspecting the proletarian revolutionary masses and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement.

A great piece of news for the people of the whole country: The large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army" will begin screening in Beijing, Shanghai, and across the country starting from the 30th.

This film, jointly produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and the August First Film Studio, truthfully records our great leader Chairman Mao, at a crucial moment in the struggle between the two lines, once again inspecting the proletarian revolutionary masses and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. At this time, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive stage and the great criticism of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is underway, its screening will undoubtedly bring great encouragement and boundless strength to the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in the struggle.

Chairman Mao's fifth and sixth inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army took place on October 18 and November 3, 1966. At that time, a small handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, relying on the power they temporarily held, did not hesitate to use various counter-revolutionary means such as inciting the masses to fight the masses and students to fight students, to attack the proletarian revolutionary masses, implement white terror, and attempt to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and sabotage the unstoppable Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the most difficult time in the struggle, the warriors of the proletarian revolutionary masses looked towards Beijing, held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and turned to Chairman Mao. They firmly believed that the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, the red sun in the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, supported them. They firmly believed that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line would definitely achieve complete and thorough victory. It was at this critical moment that Chairman Mao, on October 18, 1966, rode in a car to inspect 150,000 revolutionary youngsters gathered on the 50-mile red road in the capital! Half a month later, on November 3, Chairman Mao again ascended the Tiananmen Gate to inspect 2 million Cultural Revolution Army!

The film begins by drawing the audience to the jubilant Tiananmen Square. Here, the Cultural Revolution Army from all regions and ethnic groups across the country, with the boundless love of the revolutionary people of the whole country for the great leader Chairman Mao, with the belief in the inevitable victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and with the revolutionary determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, came to the unprecedented source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, came to the side of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao—the Beijing. These vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these revolutionary warriors fighting on the front line of the struggle between the two lines, read Chairman Mao's great teachings over and over again, sang "Father and Mother are Dear, but Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" again and again, eagerly awaiting the happiest moment to come.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao appears on the screen! Chairman Mao rides in an open-top car to our midst! Chairman Mao ascends the Tiananmen Gate and waves and smiles at us! The red tide and red sea formed by the Cultural Revolution Army boil over! People sincerely wish our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao eternal life, and people resolutely pledge to the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao: "Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" "Firmly defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line!" Chairman Mao understands the revolutionary demands of the masses the best and supports the revolutionary actions of the masses the most. The film recreates the moving scene of Chairman Mao being united with the revolutionary masses. On the open-top car and on the Tiananmen Gate, Chairman Mao waves to the cheering revolutionary youngsters again and again. Chairman Mao, with his unlimited trust in the masses and his great practice of sharing the same breath and destiny with the masses, sets a brilliant example for all Party comrades and the younger generation. In the sixth inspection lasting seven hours, Chairman Mao stood on the Tiananmen Gate all the time and walked to the east and west ends of the gate nine times to warmly wave and applaud to the cheering crowd. Chairman Mao is so kind and so affectionate, full of vigor and vitality, always with the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao, with his powerful and vigorous arm, points forward to the proletarian revolutionary masses who are being inspected!

In this film, the audience hears again Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, issuing a great call to the Cultural Revolution Army to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line are incompatible. Only by thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its influence can we correctly, completely, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's line."

Those who watched the film "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army" during the preview, including the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in the capital, expressed that we will definitely not disappoint the great concern of the great leader Chairman Mao for us, firmly implement and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    新华社二十九日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段，在“五一”国际劳动节前夕，我们向全国革命人民报告一个大喜讯：大型彩色文献纪录片《毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军》，从三十日起，将在北京、上海和全国各地陆续上映。
    由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂和八一电影制片厂联合摄制的这部影片，真实地纪录了我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在两条路线斗争的关键时刻，又一次检阅了无产阶级革命派，全心全意地支持革命群众运动的伟大史实。在当前对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的革命形势下，它的上映，必将给斗争中的广大工农兵、革命师生和革命干部带来巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。
    毛主席第五次、第六次检阅文化革命大军的时间，是一九六六年十月十八日和十一月三日。当时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，坚持资产阶级反动路线，凭借暂时还把持着的一些权势，不惜采用挑动群众斗群众、挑动学生斗学生等各种反革命手段，围攻无产阶级革命派，实行白色恐怖，妄图抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，破坏势不可挡的无产阶级文化大革命。在斗争最艰苦的时候，无产阶级革命派的战士们，眼望北京，手捧《毛主席语录》，心向毛主席，他们坚信当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家、亿万革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席支持他们，他们坚信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一定能取得完全的、彻底的胜利。就是在这样的关键时刻，毛主席在一九六六年十月十八日，乘车检阅了汇集在首都五十华里红色大道上的一百五十万革命小将！半个月后的十一月三日，毛主席又登上天安门城楼，检阅了二百万文化革命大军！
    影片一开始，就把观众吸引到欢腾的天安门广场。在这里，来自全国各地区各民族的文化革命大军，带着全国革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，带着对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的必胜信念，带着誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的革命决心，来到史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的策源地，来到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的身边——北京。这些无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，这些战斗在两条路线斗争第一线的革命战士，一次又一次地朗读毛主席的伟大教导，一遍又一遍地歌唱《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》，期待着最幸福的时刻的到来。
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，在银幕上出现了！毛主席乘坐敞篷汽车来到我们中间了！毛主席登上天安门城楼向我们微笑招手了！由文化革命大军汇成的红色巨流和红色海洋沸腾了！人们最衷心地祝愿我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，人们最坚定地向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席宣誓：“坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线！”毛主席最了解群众的革命要求，最支持群众的革命行动。影片再现了毛主席和革命群众心连心的激动人心的场面。在敞篷汽车上，在天安门城楼上，毛主席一次又一次地向欢呼的革命小将们挥手致意。毛主席以他无限信任群众，和群众同呼吸、共命运的伟大实践，给全党同志，给青年一代树立了最光辉的榜样。在第六次长达七个小时的检阅中，毛主席始终站在天安门城楼上，并且先后九次走向城楼的东西两端，向欢呼的人群亲切招手、鼓掌。毛主席是那样慈祥，那样亲切，神采奕奕，精力饱满，一直和革命群众在一起。毛主席向接受检阅的无产阶级革命派，挥起他那雄劲有力的手臂，直指前方！
    在这部影片中，观众们又一次听到林彪副主席代表我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席向文化革命大军发出彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的伟大号召。林彪副主席说：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，是水火不相容的。只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，才能正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线。”
    在预映时看过《毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军》这部影片的首都工农兵、革命师生、革命干部表示，我们一定不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对我们的巨大关怀，坚决执行和捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决彻底地批判以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
