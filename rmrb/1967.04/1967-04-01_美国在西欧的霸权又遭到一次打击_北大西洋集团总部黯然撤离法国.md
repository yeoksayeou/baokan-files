The U.S. hegemony in Western Europe has suffered another blow. The headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been forced to withdraw from France in a gloomy atmosphere.

New China News Agency, Paris, March 30th - The flags of the NATO member countries, which had been hoisted on the flagpoles of the so-called Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) near Paris for sixteen years, were finally lowered today. The headquarters of this military alliance, controlled by the United States, had to withdraw from France, just two days before the deadline set by French President Charles de Gaulle.

Neither de Gaulle nor his cabinet ministers attended the withdrawal ceremony. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. European Command, General Lyman Lemnitzer, said with a heavy heart, "This marks the end of an era." He added, "We leave France with a sense of regret."

The Chief of the French Armed Forces Staff, General Charles Ailleret, who represented France at the ceremony, emphasized that France believes "it is no longer reasonable to integrate a significant part of its military forces into an alliance's military organization," and "this is why the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe had to withdraw from France."

The French authorities, fearing that the U.S. war in Vietnam would escalate and drag France into it, took advantage of the U.S. being deeply embroiled in the Vietnam War and unable to focus on Europe. They challenged the U.S. by announcing a year ago that France would withdraw from the NATO military structure on July 1, 1966, and ordered the alliance and U.S. military personnel, military organizations, and facilities to withdraw from French territory by April 1, 1967. Since the announcement of France's decision, the U.S. has had to withdraw 30,000 military personnel, two headquarters, fourteen air bases, and forty military facilities from France. The NATO military headquarters has also been completely withdrawn.

    美国在西欧的霸权又遭到一次打击
    北大西洋集团总部黯然撤离法国
    新华社巴黎三十日电  北大西洋集团成员国的国旗，在巴黎附近的所谓盟国驻欧军队最高司令部的旗杆上悬挂了十六年之后，今天终于降了下来。由美国控制的这个军事集团的总司令部不得不撤离法国，这离法国总统戴高乐所规定的最后期限只有两天。
    戴高乐和他的政府部长都没有参加撤离仪式。北大西洋集团军队总司令兼驻欧洲美军司令兰尼兹尔不胜凄怆地说：“这是一个历史时期的终结。”他还说：“我们怀着遗憾的心情离开法国。”
    代表法国方面参加仪式的法国武装部队参谋长阿耶雷强调，法国认为，“把它的很重要的一部分军事力量并入一个联盟的军事组织已不再合理”，而“这就说明了盟国驻欧军队最高司令部为什么要撤离法国”。
    法国当局由于害怕美国侵略越南的战火越烧越大会连累法国，同时又趁美国深陷在侵越战争中无暇西顾的时机，向美国挑战，在一年前宣布，法国在一九六六年七月一日退出北大西洋集团的军事机构，并且勒令这个集团和美国的军事人员、军事机构和设施在一九六七年四月一日以前撤离法国领土。自从法国上述决定宣布后，美国已有三万名军事人员、两个司令部、十四个空军基地和四十种军事设施不得不先后撤离法国，北大西洋集团军队的司令部也已全部撤走。
