Title: Two "Compradors," One Kind

The film "The Last Emperor" was hailed by the top capitalist-roader in the Party as a work of "patriotism." In reality, it is a thoroughly reactionary and traitorous film. In this film, the author, standing on a reactionary position, praises a slavish imperialist political comprador—Cixi.

Historically, Cixi was merely a concubine of the Guangxu Emperor who did not win the favor of Cixi. However, the author portrays her as a pivotal figure in the political arena, a "hero" who saves the country. The film begins by showing Cixi's deep concern for the declining fate of the Qing Dynasty. She actively promotes and supports Guangxu's political reforms and declares: "As long as the Emperor carries out his previous words, reforms, and strives for strength, even if it means lowering my status or even killing me, I am willing to do so." Her support for reform is merely to establish a bourgeois republic in China that retains feudal forces.

"For the sake of invasion, imperialism created the comprador system in China," and Cixi is a comprador of this imperialist necessity. After the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform, she placed all her hopes on imperialist intervention in China. The invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which brought deep national calamities, she saw as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." She told Guangxu: "The various countries will definitely forgive the Emperor. At that time, the Emperor can step forward, restore order, and I believe the various countries will not only not harm the Emperor but will also help the Emperor restore the throne and revive the dynasty." She was determined to "die rather than leave," preparing to collaborate with imperialism to "restore order" and "revive the dynasty."

The release of this film coincides with the moment when the Chiang Kai-shek regime is facing total collapse. The author praises such a Cixi, who dreams of relying on imperialist power to restore reactionary rule, as a hero, saying, "If everyone in China were like you, China would be saved." This has extremely reactionary political intentions.

In his essay "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," Chairman Mao pointed out that the Chinese people will achieve final victory in the great war of liberation. However, the enemy will not willingly retreat from the stage of history. At that time, China's reactionaries and American aggressors, on the one hand, played the "peace" trick, and on the other hand, were inciting some people to "try to infiltrate the revolutionary camp, form a so-called opposition within the revolutionary camp, in order to preserve reactionary forces and sabotage revolutionary forces." They "strive to stop the revolution here; if it is to advance, it should be in a moderate color, and it must not infringe too much on the interests of imperialism and its lackeys." This Cixi, created by reactionary writers and a film company that claims "the Communist Party must not be allowed to use," shouts "die rather than leave," lies in wait, "restores order," and "revives the dynasty." Isn't this exactly reflecting the counter-revolutionary needs of American imperialism and its lackeys?

However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, who always regards himself as an "old revolutionary" and an "old party member," actually praises this treachery as patriotism and sings its praises.

Is this accidental? No, it is not accidental! The top capitalist-roader in the Party and the Cixi in the film actually share the same thoughts, sing the same tune, and walk the same path.

The Cixi on the screen exaggerates the power of imperialism and spreads fear of imperialism, saying, "Although Japan is small, they are now rich and strong, and we may not be able to defeat them!" She even further advocates the theory of national extinction, fearing that offending the "foreigners" would lead to "national extinction." The top capitalist-roader in the Party also kneels before American imperialism, shamelessly boasting, "America has great power, it is the strongest country in the world," and "in capitalist countries, you can buy anything." This greatly boosts the morale of imperialism and reactionaries and dampens the spirit of socialism and the revolutionary people of the world. He and Cixi sing the same tune.

Cixi shamelessly beautifies and praises imperialist aggression, saying that imperialism will not only not "harm" but will also "forgive" and "help" China. The top capitalist-roader in the Party also sends flattering words to imperialism, saying, "Even within the American ruling class, there are some people with clearer minds who gradually realize that the war policy may not be beneficial to America," deliberately beautifying imperialism and spreading illusions about imperialism to numb the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people; he even, a few months after the release of "The Last Emperor," at a university's opening ceremony, repeated the nonsense of the likes of Acheson that aggression is "friendship," saying that imperialist cultural aggression "has made great achievements in raising the cultural level of the Chinese people," openly and shamelessly singing praises for imperialist aggression against China.

Cixi shows a servile attitude, applauding imperialist aggression and plundering of China. The top capitalist-roader in the Party is not far behind, eagerly shouting, "America must find compradors in China, and we can also be compradors, red compradors!" He is determined to be a servant of American imperialism. History has proven that he is willing to be a servant. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he, on the one hand, actively promoted the so-called "peaceful democratic new stage" line of national and class capitulation within the Party; on the other hand, he published articles expressing "gratitude" to American imperialism for its so-called "help" to China, begging American imperialism for "peace," saying things like "China's domestic peace and international peace in the Far East, you (referring to the American government) and we need it equally," "hoping" that American imperialism "sympathizes" with the "peace" cause of the Chinese people, and so on, showing a servile attitude.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "There is no love without reason, and there is no hatred without reason." The reason why the top capitalist-roader in the Party praises the imperialist comprador Cixi as a "patriot" is that he also wants to be a "red comprador" of imperialism. Two compradors, one mind: they both dream of a bourgeois republic that "China cannot have." The comprador Cixi on the screen dreams of establishing a bourgeois republic, and the top capitalist-roader in the Party also yearns for the capitalist world. For a long time, he has been talking non-stop about protecting the rich peasant economy, saying that "the exploitation of capitalists now is not only not a sin but also a merit," and that "the free market of capitalism should still be continued... and it is not scary if some bourgeois elements emerge in society, and we should not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," and so on, crazily carrying out activities to restore capitalism. This top capitalist-roader in the Party, who always talks about "cultivation," has become the "so-called opposition within the revolutionary camp" that American imperialism and reactionaries needed and "encouraged" 18 years ago. He, just as American imperialism "hopes," not only "strives to stop the revolution here" but also dreams of restoring capitalism in China in a yellow calabash dream.

It is not surprising that the top capitalist-roader in the Party praises treachery as patriotism and praises figures like Cixi. After all, they are of the same ilk.

    两个“买办”，一个货色
    ——谈珍妃及其他
    常方
    被党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派捧为“爱国主义”的《清宫秘史》，是一部彻头彻尾的卖国主义的反动影片。在这部影片里，作者站在反动的立场上，颂扬了一个奴性十足的帝国主义的“政治买办”——珍妃。
    历史上的珍妃不过是一个不得慈禧欢心的光绪妃子，但是作者把她打扮成左右政局举足轻重的“救国”英雄。影片开始就表现珍妃对“一天一天衰败下去”的大清王朝的国运无穷忧虑。她积极推动和支持光绪搞政治改良，并且还下定决心：“只要皇上实行以前的话，维新变法，发愤图强，别说把奴婢的虚名降低，就是把奴婢杀了，奴婢也是甘心情愿的”。她所以竭其全力赞助改革，无非是想要在中国建立一个保留封建势力的资产阶级共和国。
    “为了侵略的必要，帝国主义给中国造成了买办制度”，珍妃就是帝国主义这种必要的“买办制度”的买办。戊戌政变失败以后，她把全部的希望都寄托在帝国主义对中国的干涉上。八国联军的入侵明明带来了深重的民族灾难，她却当作“千载一时的机会来了”。她对光绪说：“各国一定会原谅皇上，那时候皇上挺身而出，收拾残局，我相信各国非但不会伤害皇上，还会帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲。”她决心“宁死不走”，准备认贼作父，投靠帝国主义来“好好的干一下”：
    “收拾”一败涂地的政局，“重振”清朝反动统治的
    “朝纲”。
    这部影片的问世，正是蒋家王朝面临彻底崩溃的时刻。作者把这样一个妄想依靠帝国主义力量来恢复反动统治的珍妃，当作“要是中国的人，人人都象你，中国就有救了”的英雄来歌颂，是有其极为反动的政治目的的。
    毛主席在《将革命进行到底》一文中指出，中国人民将要在伟大的解放战争中获得最后胜利，但是敌人不会甘心退出历史舞台。当时中国的反动派和美国侵略者，一方面玩弄
    “和平”阴谋，另一方面正在策动一些人，“力求混入革命阵营，构成革命阵营中的所谓反对派，以便保存反动势力，破坏革命势力”。他们“极力使革命就此止步；如果再要前进，则应带上温和的色彩，务必不要太多地侵犯帝国主义及其走狗的利益”。这个由反动文人和扬言“决不能让共产党利用”的反动影业公司共同炮制出来的珍妃，叫嚷着“宁死不走”，潜伏下来，“收拾残局”，“重振朝纲”，不正是反映了美帝国主义及其走狗的这种反革命需要吗？
    但是，一贯以“老革命”、“老党员”自居的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，居然也把这种卖国主义吹捧成爱国主义，为它大唱赞美诗。
    这是偶然的吗？不，这决不是偶然的！党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和影片上的珍妃，实际上是一个心思，唱的一个调子，走的一个路子。
    银幕上的珍妃极力夸大帝国主义的力量，大肆宣扬恐帝思想，说什么：“日本国虽小，可是他们现在国富民强，咱们不一定打得过他们呢！”甚至还进一步鼓吹亡国论，惟恐触犯了“洋人”就要“亡国”。而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派也拜倒在美帝国主义的脚下，无耻地吹嘘：“美国是有强大力量的，是世界上最强大的国家”，“一到资本主义国家什么都能买到”等等，大长帝国主义和反动派的志气，大灭社会主义和世界革命人民的威风。他和珍妃唱的完全是一个腔调。
    珍妃恣意美化和歌颂帝国主义的侵略，说什么帝国主义不仅不会“伤害”，而且还会“原谅”、“帮助”中国。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也向帝国主义频送秋波，说什么：“就是在美国统治集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人，逐渐认识到战争政策未必对美国有利”，极力美化帝国主义，散布对帝国主义的幻想，来麻痹革命人民的斗志；甚至他还在《清宫秘史》上映以后几个月，在一个大学的开学典礼上，重弹艾奇逊之流侵略就是“友谊”的滥调，胡说什么帝国主义的文化侵略“对提高中国人民的文化水平有很大成绩的”，明目张胆地公然为帝国主义对中国的侵略大唱颂歌。
    珍妃表现了一副洋奴相，鼓掌欢迎帝国主义对中国的侵略和掠夺。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也不甘落后，争着嚷嚷：“美国非要在中国找买办不可，我们也可以给他当买办，红色买办么！”一心想当美帝国主义的奴才。事实证明，他是甘当奴才的。抗日战争胜利以后，他一方面在党内积极推行所谓“和平民主新阶段”的民族投降主义和阶级投降主义路线；另一方面发表文章表示“感谢”美帝国主义对中国的所谓“帮助”，向美帝国主义乞求“和平”，说什么“中国的国内和平与远东的国际和平，你们（指美国政府）与我们同样需要”呀，“希望”美帝国主义“同情”中国人民的“和平”事业呀，等等，一副卑躬屈膝的奴才嘴脸。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派之所以把帝国主义买办人物珍妃吹捧成“爱国主义”者，原来他也一心想当帝国主义的“红色买办”。两个“买办”，一条心思：他们梦寐以求的无非都是一个“中国不能有”的资产阶级共和国。银幕上的买办珍妃梦想建立一个资产阶级共和国，银幕下的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派对资本主义世界也十分向往。长期以来他喋喋不休地大肆叫嚷什么“长期保护富农经济”，什么“资本家现在的剥削，不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”，什么资本主义的“自由市场还是搞下去……，至于社会上产生一些资产阶级分子并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥”，等等，疯狂地进行资本主义复辟活动。这个开口“修养”闭口“修养”的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，充当了美帝国主义和反动派十八年前就需要和“鼓励”的“革命阵营中的所谓反对派”。他也正象美帝国主义所“期望”的那样，不仅“极力使革命就此止步”，而且还做着一场要在中国实现资本主义复辟的黄粱美梦。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派把卖国主义当作爱国主义，还歌颂什么珍妃之流的人物，这是毫不奇怪的，本来他们就是一路的货色。
