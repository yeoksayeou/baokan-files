We have correctly implemented the cadre policy personally formulated by Chairman Mao, defeated the rampant attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue, and thus united with the majority of cadres, thoroughly isolating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Our station has 28 cadres above the workshop level, and the vast majority have successively joined the Red Guards and followed Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Among them, two cadres joined the Red Guards from the beginning, some joined the Revolutionary Committee, some continued to lead their original work, and some were temporarily assigned appropriate work. In this way, the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres was fully mobilized, and they, together with the Red Guards, shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. The entire station is in a revolutionary fervor, and transportation and production are getting better and better: the attendance rate of workers increased from 85% in January to 96% in April; non-production personnel were reduced by 65%; passenger trains, which were almost never on time in January, are now 100% on time; the on-time departure rate of freight trains increased from 82.2% in January to 96.7% in April; various quantitative and qualitative indicators are getting better and better; since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, large and small accidents have been eliminated.

Among the cadre team, we Red Guards have a clear understanding of who is who. For the original members of the station Party Committee and station director Wang Chengyi and eight other cadres who implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we did not drag them out for criticism or pull them onto the stage for struggle. The power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road slandered them as "traitors" and "anti-Party elements." We firmly supported them in their struggle against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, always encouraging them to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize themselves, supporting them in taking up their original leadership positions, and directing the entire station's transportation work. For the 20 cadres who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the past, suppressed revolutionary masses, and committed various errors, we conducted a serious analysis of them, looking at their entire work, both their errors and their achievements; looking at their performance during the Cultural Revolution, as well as their overall historical performance. The result was that most of them were deceived by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and, under the constraints of the "organizational discipline" formulated by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and committed errors, but they are still relatively good cadres; some committed serious errors but are not rightists who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought; only one or two belong to the fourth category of cadres.

After clarifying the enemy and ourselves, we, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," educated and encouraged the cadres who made errors and serious errors to recognize their errors, criticize their errors, correct their errors, and boldly stand up to make the revolution and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

1. Unify the Red Guards' ideological understanding and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy

After the Red Guards seized power, some comrades said, "The power-holders once labeled us as 'counter-revolutionaries,' now it's our turn to pull them down." Others said, "We should criticize and struggle against them too, and then let them come back to power, they will definitely wear us down." Still, others said, "They were officials and bosses in the past, now they should all step aside." These thoughts, if not resolved, would make it impossible for cadres who made errors to stand up even if they criticized and corrected their errors.

We grasped these active thoughts and organized the Red Guards and revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's teachings on cadre policy, on correctly handling two types of contradictions, and on criticism and self-criticism with problems in mind. Chairman Mao's teachings were like a key that opened their hearts, making comrades with erroneous understandings seriously criticize their selfish thoughts. Some said, "We are victims of the bourgeois reactionary line, and cadres who made errors were also poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line and deceived by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. We cannot implement the reactionary line to harm comrades." Others said, "We are Red Guards and must act according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We must expose the bad things in their minds and make them good comrades. If they truly touch their souls and truly correct their errors, we will rely on and unite with those who should be relied on and united with." Still, others said, "Cadres who return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will not implement revenge. If anyone dares to do so, we Red Guards will rebel against them." After raising their ideological awareness, some even actively helped cadres unburden themselves. Red Guard Li Zhaoan, who was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by the branch secretary of the rolling stock department, Guan Zhongxin, in the early stages of the movement, said, "I hated Guan Zhongxin to the core, and even if I bit him to death, I wouldn't be satisfied." After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, he said, "Old Guan and I are both from poor peasant backgrounds. He is not bad from the root. The mistake is that he followed the directives of the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and did many bad things. Errors must be allowed to be corrected, and we cannot hold onto people's mistakes."

2. Eliminate the "five fears" in cadres' minds and remove ideological obstacles for them to stand up and make the revolution

Some cadres who made errors could not stand up at first. The root cause was that they were selfish and fearful. We analyzed that they generally had five fears: they feared being called "opportunists" if they stood up to rebel; they dared not take on work for fear of being held accountable for both old and new debts; they feared being called "traitors" if they exposed the problems of the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road; they feared being criticized again if they stood up to be cadres; they feared not being trusted by the masses if they stood up due to serious errors.

To eliminate the "five fears" in cadres' minds, we did the following:

First, we organized cadres who made errors to study "Three Articles" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" with problems in mind. This study had a particularly good effect, and many people criticized their selfish thoughts and established the confidence to revolutionize to the end. The original branch secretary of the rolling stock department, Guan Zhongxin, said, "In the past, I did not serve the people wholeheartedly but served the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road wholeheartedly. I went against Chairman Mao's teachings in the past and made errors. If I am still afraid of this and that and dare not stand up to make the revolution today, I will make even greater errors!" The original Party Committee member, Wang Yingbin, said, "In the past, I was afraid and did not dare to admit obvious errors, not talking about serious ones, only talking about minor ones. After studying 'Three Articles,' I felt that I had let down Chairman Mao's expectations. I have made up my mind to not only honestly admit my errors but also to resolutely correct them."

Second, we did detailed ideological work and patiently helped and educated cadres who made errors to return to the right path and stand up to follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Members of the Revolutionary Committee, core members of the Red Guards, leaders of various combat teams, and Red Guards all did ideological work for cadres. For cadres with heavy selfish thoughts or many shortcomings and errors, we generally had more than ten talks, some reaching over thirty, until they decided to stand up to make the revolution. The original branch secretary of the freight department, Liu Mao, was a cadre promoted by the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement. The head of the Revolutionary Committee, Yang Chunsheng, asked him in an individual talk, "What is your family background?" Answer: "Poor peasant." Again asked, "Who liberated you?" Answer: "Chairman Mao." Again asked, "Then why did you label your class brothers as 'counter-revolutionaries'?" Answer: "For the bourgeois reactionary line." Again asked, "Is this how you repay Chairman Mao?" At this point, Liu Mao cried painfully and said excitedly, "The working people raised me, the Party educated me to be a man, but I forgot my roots and served the bourgeoisie, suppressing my comrades. I really let Chairman Mao down! I must draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and defend Chairman Mao to the death!"

Third, we did work among the families, encouraging family members to do ideological work for cadres. Cadres who made errors were deeply influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line and could not turn their thoughts around immediately. The help from their families often made it easier for cadres to untie the knots in their minds. The original Party Committee organizational secretary, Li Baiyan, had heavy errors and many concerns and did not dare to stand up. We encouraged his wife to help him, making him firm in his resolve to correct his errors and quickly stand up to make the revolution.

Fourth, we organized cadres who stood up to speak from their own experiences to do ideological work for cadres who had not yet stood up. Li Baiyan was the first cadre who made errors to stand up at our station. His problems were similar to Guan Zhongxin's, so we had Li Baiyan help Guan Zhongxin correctly understand his own errors and actively stand up to make the revolution. Guan Zhongxin eliminated his ideological concerns, prepared for two days and two nights, and exposed many problems of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the original Party Committee, simultaneously rebelling against the "selfishness" in his own mind and truly drawing a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in his thoughts.

3. Hold various exposure and criticism meetings to educate cadres to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

The bourgeois reactionary line is not thoroughly criticized, and cadres who were deceived and used cannot completely break with this reactionary line; only when they see through the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line can they truly recognize and criticize their own errors, draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For this, we did the following:

First, we held revolutionary mass meetings to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Since the end of last year, we have consecutively held more than 20 exposure and criticism meetings of the bourgeois reactionary line, and revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres used a large number of facts to expose the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Many cadres who were originally deceived and helped the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road implement the bourgeois reactionary line received great education. The original Party Committee member and station director, Wang Chengyi, and other revolutionary cadres stood up under the white terror, breaking through numerous obstacles. At that time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were panicked, on the one hand using the "organizational discipline" formulated by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road to scare people, on the other hand labeling cadres who exposed the problems of the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road at the station as "traitors," "anti-Party elements," and so on, attempting to seal the mouths of revolutionary cadres; even more viciously, they tightly grasped that knowledgeable cadres also made errors, inducing them to hide problems and protect themselves to pass inspection. We deeply knew that exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line could most expose the ugly faces of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and most educate cadres who were deceived and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line to recognize their errors. Therefore, after seizing power, we consecutively held exposure and criticism meetings of the bourgeois reactionary line, putting the various crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line under the sun, enlightening and educating revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, making them deeply hate and detest the reactionary line.

Second, we held 14 cadre revolutionary rebellion meetings, encouraging revolutionary cadres to boldly admit their errors and boldly expose problems. The incident of privately burning black materials against revolutionary masses was originally done by two members of the original Party Committee at the behest of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to escape responsibility and eliminate evidence. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road grasped the fear psychology of the two and attempted to collude and not admit their errors. At the cadre rebellion meeting, we encouraged the original Party Committee member, Wang Yingbin, to dispel his concerns, boldly admit his own errors, and bravely expose the conspiracies of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, immediately collapsing the "attack and defense alliance" formulated by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The original Party Committee member, Li Baiyan, while criticizing his own errors, presented one specific example after another, exposing many serious crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, such as promoting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and excluding cadres of worker origin. The more problems were exposed, the more thoroughly they were criticized, and many cadres who made errors successively stood up, criticizing their own errors and exposing the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Third, we held cadre "appearance" meetings, making cadres who made errors accept the criticism and help of revolutionary masses. After the cadre rebellion meeting, the problems of cadres were basically clarified, giving cadres ample time to study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind and write check materials. Then, we held a revolutionary worker meeting, cadres "appear" to check and accept the criticism and help of revolutionary masses. As long as cadres who made errors or serious errors rebelled against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line, and rebelled against the "selfishness" in their own minds, drawing a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary masses were satisfied, and they were unburdened and assigned appropriate work. Now, 18 cadres who made errors or serious errors have, under the influence of Chairman Mao's cadre policy, discarded the old and sought the new, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    团结干部大多数，孤立打击一小撮
    哈尔滨铁路局三棵树车站红色造反团
    我们正确地贯彻执行了毛主席亲自制定的党的干部政策，打垮了在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的猖狂进攻，从而，团结了干部的大多数，彻底孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我站二十八名车间以上干部，绝大多数先后和红色造反者站到一起，跟着毛主席干革命。其中有两名干部一开始就参加了红色造反团，有的参加了革命委员会，有的继续担任原来的领导工作，有的临时安排了适当的工作。这样就充分调动了革命干部的积极性，他们和红色造反者一起，挑起革命、生产两副重担。全站革命热火朝天，运输生产越来越好：职工出勤率由一月份的百分之八十五，上升到百分之九十六；非生产人员精简了百分之六十五；旅客列车出发由一月几乎列列不能正点开，现在已经是百分之百正点开出；货车出发正点率由一月百分之八十二点二上升到百分之九十六点七；各项数量、质量指标越来越好；革命委员会建立以来消灭了大小事故。
    在干部队伍中谁怎么样，我们红色造反者心中是有数的。对原站党委委员、站长王成义等八名执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好干部，我们既没有拉出来批判，也没有揪上台斗争。党内走资本主义道路当权派诬蔑他们是“叛徒”、“反党分子”，我们就坚决支持他们同党内走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争，始终鼓励他们紧跟毛主席自觉革命，支持他们担当原来的领导工作，指挥全站的运输工作。对于过去执行资产阶级反动路线，打击革命群众，犯有各种错误的二十名干部，我们对他们做了认真的分析，看他们的全部工作，既看他们的错误方面，也看他们的成绩方面；既看他们在文化大革命中的表现，也看他们整个历史的表现。结果判明，他们中间大部分人是受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派制定的“组织纪律”约束下，执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，但还是比较好的干部；有的犯了严重错误，但还不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的右派分子；属于四类干部的只是一两个人。
    敌我界限划清后，我们本着毛主席教导的“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，教育和鼓励犯有错误和严重错误的干部，认识错误，批判错误，改正错误，大胆地起来革命，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    一、统一红色造反者的思想认识，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    红色造反者夺权后，有的同志说：“当权派过去把我们打成‘反革命’，这回我们也得把他们拉下马。”也有的说：“咱们把他们也批了，也斗了，再叫他们上台，非给咱小鞋穿不可。”还有的说：“他们过去当官做老爷，这回都得让他们靠边站。”等等。这些思想不解决，犯了错误的干部即使批判了自己的错误，改正了自己的错误，也是站不起来的。
    我们抓住了这些活思想，组织红色造反者和革命职工，带着问题学习了毛主席关于干部政策、关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾和关于批评与自我批评的论述。毛主席的教导象一把开心的钥匙，使有错误认识的同志认真批判了自己的私心杂念。有的说：“咱们是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，犯了错误的干部也是中了资产阶级反动路线的毒，上了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的当，我们可不能再搞反动路线去害同志。”有的说：“咱们是红色造反者，一定要按照毛主席的干部政策办事，对于干部的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，批判他们头脑里的坏东西，使他们变成好同志。他们如果真触灵魂，真改正，我们该依靠的就依靠，该团结的就团结。”有的说：“干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就不会搞打击报复那一套。谁要真敢搞，咱们红色造反者就造他的反。”思想觉悟提高后，有的还主动帮助干部放包袱。红色造反者李昭安，在运动初期被运转车间支部书记关忠信打成“反革命”。过去他说：“我恨透了关忠信，一口咬死他都不解恨。”学习了毛主席的教导以后，他说：“老关和我一样都是贫农出身，他不是从根上坏的。错就错在他随着党内走资本主义道路当权派的指挥棒转，干了许多坏事。犯了错误要允许人家改正，我们不能抓住人家不放。”
    二、破除干部头脑中的“五怕”，为站出来革命扫清思想障碍
    有些犯了错误的干部，一时站不起来，追根挖源是“私”字挂帅，“怕”字挡道。我们分析他们大体有五怕：想站出来造反，怕别人说他“投机”；给工作不敢干，怕干错了新老帐一齐算；想揭发走资本主义道路当权派的问题，怕人骂他“背叛”；压根不想站，怕再当干部挨“整”；自知错误严重，怕站出来群众不信任。
    为了破除干部头脑中的“五怕”，我们是这样做的：
    第一，组织犯错误的干部带着问题学习“老三篇”和《湖南农民运动考察报告》。
    这次学习效果特别大，许多人批判了私心杂念，树起了革命到底的信心。原运转车间党支部书记关忠信说：“以前，我不是全心全意为人民服务，而是实心实意为党内走资本主义道路当权派服务了。我过去违背了毛主席的教导，犯了错误，我今天再怕东怕西，不敢站出来革命，那就要犯更大的错误了！”原党委委员王颖斌说：“过去我怕，明摆的错误也不敢承认，重的我不讲，专讲轻的。学习了‘老三篇’，我感到自己辜负了毛主席的希望。我下定了决心，不仅要老老实实承认错误，而且要坚决改正。”
    第二，做细致的思想工作，耐心地帮助和教育犯错误的干部，使干部迷途知返，站出来跟着毛主席干革命。革命委员会成员、红色造反团的核心、各战斗队的负责人以及红色造反者都做干部的思想工作。对私心杂念重或是缺点错误多的干部，普遍做了十次以上谈话，有的达到三十多次，直到他们下定决心要站出来革命为止。原货运车间党支部书记刘茂，是党内走资本主义道路当权派一手提拔起来的干部，运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线。革命委员会班长杨春生同志在个别谈话中间问他：“你是什么家庭出身？”答：“贫农。”又问：“谁把你解放的？”答：“毛主席。”又问：“那么你把自己的阶级弟兄打成‘反革命’，是替谁服了务？”答：“替资产阶级反动路线。”又问：“你这样做对得起毛主席吗？”问到这儿，刘茂沉痛地哭起来，激动地说：“劳动人民把我养大，党教育我成人，可我忘了本，竟为资产阶级效劳，打击自己的同志，我实在对不起毛主席呀！我一定要和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，誓死保卫毛主席！”
    第三，把工作做到家属中去，鼓励家属做干部的思想工作。犯错误的干部由于受资产阶级反动路线影响较深，思想一时转不过弯来。家里人的帮助，往往容易使干部解开思想上的“扣”。原站党委组织委员李柏岩，错误重、顾虑大，不敢站出来。我们鼓励他爱人帮助他，使他坚定了改正错误的决心，迅速起来革命了。
    第四，组织站出来的干部现身说法，去做没站出来的干部的工作。李柏岩是我站犯错误干部中最先站出来的一个。他的问题和关忠信的问题相似，我们便叫李柏岩帮助关忠信正确认识自己犯的错误，积极站出来革命。关忠信破除了思想顾虑，连着准备两天两夜，一下子揭发了原党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的许多问题，同时也造了自己头脑中“私”字的反，真正从思想上与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限。
    三、召开各种揭发批判会，教育干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来
    资产阶级反动路线批不透，受蒙蔽和被利用的干部就不能同这条反动路线彻底决裂；只有他们看清了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，才能真正认识和批判自己所犯的错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。为此，我们做了这样几件工作：
    第一，召开革命群众大会，猛揭狠批资产阶级反动路线。从去年年底开始，我们连续召开了二十多次揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的大会，革命群众和革命干部用大量事实揭露了资产阶级反动路线的罪行。许多原来受蒙蔽，帮助党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派执行资产阶级反动路线的干部，受到了很大教育。原站党委委员、站长王成义等革命干部，在白色恐怖下，冲破了重重阻力站出来了。当时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派慌了手脚，一面用党内头号走资本主义道路当权派制定的“组织纪律”吓人，一面给揭发车站党内走资本主义道路当权派问题的干部加上了“叛徒”、“反党分子”等等罪名，妄图封住革命干部的嘴；更恶毒的是，他们紧紧抓住知情的干部也犯过错误这一点，诱逼他们隐瞒问题，保护自己蒙混过关。我们深知猛揭狠批资产阶级反动路线，最能暴露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶嘴脸，最能教育受蒙蔽而执行资产阶级反动路线的干部认识错误，所以，在夺权以后，我们又连续召开揭发批判资产阶级反动路线大会，把资产阶级反动路线的种种罪行摆在光天化日之下，启发教育革命群众和革命干部，使他们对反动路线深恶痛绝。
    第二，我们召开了十四次干部革命造反大会，鼓励革命干部大胆承认错误，大胆揭发问题。私自焚烧整革命群众的黑材料的事件，本来是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了逃脱罪责，消灭罪迹，指使原党委两名委员干的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派抓住他俩的害怕心理，妄图串通一气，死不承认错误。在干部造反大会上，我们鼓励原党委委员王颖斌打消顾虑，大胆承认自己的错误，勇敢揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，一下子冲垮了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派阴谋制定的“攻守同盟”。原站党委委员李柏岩在批判自己所犯错误的同时，摆出一件件具体事例，揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派重用地、富、反、坏、右分子，排斥工人出身干部等许多严重罪行。问题越揭越深，越批越透，许多犯错误的干部，先后站了出来，既批判了自己的错误，又揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。
    第三，召开干部“亮相”会，使犯错误的干部接受革命群众的批评帮助。经过干部革命造反会，干部的问题基本弄清，给干部充分时间，边带着问题学习毛主席著作，边写检查材料。然后，召开革命职工大会，干部“亮相”检查，接受革命群众批评帮助。凡是犯了错误或犯了严重错误的干部，只要造了党内走资本主义道路当权派的反、造资产阶级反动路线的反和造自己头脑中“私”字的反，划清同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、同资产阶级反动路线两个“界限”，革命群众满意后，就给他们卸包袱，分配适当工作。现在，犯了错误或严重错误的十八名干部，都在毛主席的干部政策感召下，弃旧图新，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
