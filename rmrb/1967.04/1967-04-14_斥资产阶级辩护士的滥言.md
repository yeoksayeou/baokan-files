The editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* and Comrade Chen Boda's article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" have exposed the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in China, shamelessly glorifies the bourgeoisie and opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He brazenly mimics the jester's tone, saying: "Capitalist sir! I beg you to exploit me! If you exploit me, I can eat, and my wife and children can live. If you don't exploit me, it will be disastrous." This is sheer nonsense! I will use my personal experiences to denounce the capitalist's heinous crimes and refute this deceitful talk.

The more the capitalists exploit, the harder it is for the poor to survive. In the old society, my family of eight had only over three mu of land. One year, a severe drought struck my hometown, the land cracked, and there was no harvest. My family could not make a living, so we had to pawn all our land to the landlord. The ruthless landlord burdened my family with heavy debts. Unable to repay the debts, we had to wander to Xuyong County in Sichuan. My father, mother, and elder brother all worked for the capitalists. However, whether it was the landlord or the capitalist, they were all wolves that devoured people without spitting out bones. My father, mother, and brother worked day and night, but the whole family still had to eat coarse grains and were as thin as skeletons. The bitter days were unbearable. Soon, my mother, worn out from overwork and starvation, died. Just after my mother was buried, my younger sister also starved to death. Thus, the wicked capitalists repeatedly arrested and beat my father to extort money. Once, he was beaten so badly that his skin was torn and blood was dripping. When he was released, I could hardly recognize him as my father. This planted a deep hatred for capitalists in my young heart.

I myself started working for the capitalists as a child laborer at the age of fourteen. Those days were even more bitter. Every night, I would go to work at midnight, and any slight mistake would result in beatings and scolding. On the eve of national liberation, the capitalists, to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, forced us to work overtime without a moment's rest. Once, after eating, I went to the toilet. When I returned, the foreman raised his whip and beat me. He said while beating me, "You poor devil, you didn't finish your work and went to shit. I'll beat you to death." What kind of world is this! In this world, how many poor people have suffered from the capitalists' exploitation, oppression, and bullying!

On October 1, 1949, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated my hometown. To defend the fruits of the revolution, I joined the glorious People's Liberation Army. On the first day of my enlistment, I thought: we poor people have stood up, and we must not let the class enemies return! Under the nurturing of the Party and Chairman Mao, I came to understand even more the evil of capitalist exploitation and was determined to dedicate my life to defending the proletarian cause. At that time, American imperialism launched the Korean War. I immediately volunteered to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the five campaigns, I was seriously wounded in the left leg but refused to leave the battlefield, determined to give the American aggressors a good beating and avenge the oppressed people of the world. Whenever I thought of Chairman Mao and the blood debt, I was ready to face any danger. Later, in the famous "Hongshanpu Counterattack," I was assigned the task of demolition. I braved the enemy's gunfire, detonated explosives fifteen times, repelled the enemy's seven counterattacks, annihilated over two hundred and forty enemy soldiers, opened a path for our troops, and won the battle. I had only one thought: firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and fight to the end against American imperialism—the backer of the Kuomintang reactionaries!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party shamelessly sings the praises of exploitation, intending to drag us back to the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. His intentions are so malicious! Let me tell you, this will never happen!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the American imperialist forces of aggression in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." We must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and fight to the end with this Khrushchev-like schemer. I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further transform my non-proletarian thoughts, and like the heroes Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and Guo Jiaming, defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with my blood and life, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and fight for the elimination of imperialism worldwide, the burial of capitalism, and the defense of the people's victory. I will follow Chairman Mao and fight the revolution for life.

    斥资产阶级辩护士的滥言
    前志愿军一级爆破英雄、副营长　黄家富
    《红旗》第五期评论员的文章和戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文，揭露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，为了作好在中国复辟资本主义的舆论准备，明目张胆地美化资产阶级，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他无耻地学着小丑的腔调说：“资本家先生！我请求你剥削一下吧！剥削我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去，如果不剥削，就不得了。”这完全是一派胡言！我要用自己的亲身经历，控诉资本家的滔天罪行，驳倒这种欺人之谈。
    资本家越剥削，我们穷人越活不了。在旧社会，我家八口人，只有三亩多地。有一年，家乡发生大旱灾，土地龟裂，颗粒无收。我家无法营生，只得把土地全部当给了地主。狠心的地主弄得我家债务重重。我家还不起债，只好流浪到四川叙永县。我父亲、母亲和大哥都给资本家干活。但是，天下乌鸦一般黑，无论是地主还是资本家，都是吃人不吐骨的豺狼。我父亲、母亲和哥哥一天到晚起早摸黑地拚命干，全家人还是吃糠咽菜，浑身骨瘦如柴，辛酸的日子简直不能提。不久，母亲由于积劳成疾，又没吃的，又没钱治病，就死去了。母亲刚埋到地里，小妹妹又饿死了。就这样，万恶的资本家还几次把我父亲抓去吊打勒索。有一次他竟被打得浑身皮开肉绽，鲜血淋淋。他被放回家时，我几乎认不得他是我的父亲了。这在我幼小的心灵中种下了对资本家的刻骨仇恨。
    我自己十四岁就给资本家当织布童工。那童工的日子呀，更是辛酸。每天半夜就去上工，稍有不慎就要挨打受骂。全国解放前夕，资本家为了帮蒋介石打内战，拚命叫我们加班加点，不让我们有喘息的时间。有一次，我吃过饭后去解手。我回来时，工头扬起皮鞭就抽打。他一边打还一边说：“穷小鬼，活不干完拉屎，我揍死你。”这是什么世界！在这样的世界里有多少穷人受尽了资本家的剥削、压迫和欺凌啊！
    一九四九年十月一日，共产党和毛主席把我的家乡解放了。为了保卫革命的胜利果实，我参加了光荣的人民解放军。参军的第一天我就想：我们穷人翻身了，决不能让阶级敌人卷土重来！在党和毛主席的哺育下，我更加认识了资本家剥削的罪恶，决心为保卫无产阶级的江山贡献一生。就在这时，美帝国主义猖狂发动了侵朝战争。我马上报名参加了中国人民志愿军。在五次战役中，我左腿负了重伤，坚决不下火线，坚决要狠揍美国强盗，为天下穷人报仇。只要想到毛主席，想到血泪仇，我就刀山敢上，火海敢下。后来在著名的“红山堡反击战”中，我担负爆破任务，穿过敌人的枪林弹雨，连续爆破十五次，打退了敌人七次反扑，消灭敌人二百四十余名，为部队开辟了通道，取得了战斗胜利。我只有一个心眼：坚决听毛主席的话，和美帝国主义——国民党反动派的后台老板拚到底！
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，恬不知耻地为剥削唱赞歌，就是存心要把我们拉回到半封建半殖民地的旧社会去。他的用心是多么狠毒！告诉你，这绝对办不到！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，和他拚到底，把这个赫鲁晓夫式的野心家打倒。我一定要活学活用毛主席著作，进一步改造非无产阶级思想，象英雄雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥、郭嘉宏等同志那样，用鲜血和生命捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，为消灭全世界的帝国主义、埋葬资本主义，保卫人民的胜利果实，跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
