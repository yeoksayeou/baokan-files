Songs of victory echo, and good news comes frequently. On the eve of the day of struggle for all laborers around the world – May Day, the International Labor Day, the mountain city of Guiyang is filled with a spirit of struggle and festive atmosphere. The broad masses of revolutionary workers of the proletariat, with the spirit of "seizing the day," are striving to achieve victories in both revolution and production, to welcome the first red May after the victory of the proletarian revolutionary power seizure.

With New Victories, Respond to the Minority Within the Party Who Are Taking the Capitalist Road

In the Guiyang Diesel Engine Factory, in recent days, many workshops and teams of revolutionary workers have been drumming and cheering as they bring the big red victory reports to the factory revolutionary committee, reporting the completion of the April production plan ahead of schedule: The machine processing workshop's cylinder group overcame the difficulties of having fewer people and heavier tasks, completing the processing of 500 cylinder heads ahead of schedule, setting a new record since the factory's establishment; The assembly workshop, with the highest speed of assembling 38 diesel engines per shift, completed the April assembly task four days ahead of schedule, and also assigned more than ten workers to support the machine processing workshop. Under the efforts of the broad masses of revolutionary workers, this factory completed the monthly production plan on April 26, achieving the first victory of the second quarter on the basis of overfulfilling the first quarter's production task.

The Guiyang Diesel Engine Factory's completion of the April production task ahead of schedule was the result of a hard struggle. In mid-April, the factory's production situation was not good, and the minority within the party who were taking the capitalist road were gleeful, spreading rumors and trying to make fools of the revolutionary faction.

However, these bourgeois masters were too happy too soon. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guiyang Diesel Engine Factory, in the struggle of criticizing the number one person within the party who is taking the capitalist road and the minority within the factory who are taking the capitalist road, further united and rallied all the revolutionary workers of the factory. They finally completed two-thirds of the monthly production task in the second half of the month in just eleven days, giving those bourgeois masters a resounding slap in the face. The proletarian revolutionary faction sang songs of victory, celebrating another new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Let More Revolutionary Masses Obtain Chairman Mao's Portrait on the Holiday

In the color printing workshop of the Guiyang New China Printing Factory, in recent days, a heated battle scene has emerged. Revolutionary workers are busily fighting at their posts, some are rushing to print Chairman Mao's colored portraits, some are rushing to print Mao's quotations with the leader's image and quotation posters, some are inspecting products, and some are bundling and packaging. The workers of this workshop completed the April production task on the 25th and have now started working on the May tasks. To meet the supply needs of May Day, they are working day and night in the workshop. The workers proudly declare that they will definitely let more revolutionary masses obtain Chairman Mao's portraits and quotation posters during the holiday.

The head of the revolutionary committee of this workshop said: After the nationwide call to launch a general offensive against the number one person within the party who is taking the capitalist road and the reactionary line he represents, the workshop revolutionary committee firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, mobilizing all revolutionary workers to launch a big exposure, big criticism, and big struggle against the number one person within the party who is taking the capitalist road, against the minority within the factory and workshop who are counter-revolutionary revisionists, and against the reactionary line they insist on. In the big criticism, revolutionary workers saw more clearly the evil of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and at the same time, they also realized that the workers who were deceived were also victims of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Many deceived workers also stood up to expose and denounce the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, declaring that they would definitely unite with the revolutionary workers, join forces against the enemy, and together "seize the revolution and promote production." Under these circumstances, this workshop presented a brand new scene of double victories in revolution and production.

Power Seized, Mao Zedong's Works Must Be Studied and Applied

In recent days, at the gate of the office building of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, teams of people have been continuously coming with drums and gongs to deliver good news and express their determination. More than fifty workers from the Qianjiang Electrical and Mechanical Installation Company came from more than ten miles away in the suburbs after work to report good news to the provincial revolutionary committee on behalf of all the revolutionary workers of the company. They wrote on the bright red victory report: The proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire company, holding high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a total offensive against the largest minority within the party who are taking the capitalist road while closely combining the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own unit. They deeply implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." In April, despite the shortage of manpower and the doubling of tasks, they completed the state production plan three days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. This is another victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of revolutionary workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The proletarian revolutionary workers of the Qianjiang Electrical and Mechanical Installation Company deeply felt: Seizing power relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought; holding power even more relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought. The more they were busy with production, the more they seized the time to study Chairman Mao's works. The milling group of the first workshop, in addition to insisting on studying Chairman Mao's works before shifts and meetings, also took out time during lunch breaks to study. The supply group of the second workshop failed more than twenty times during the trial production of the annealing machine, but they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" after each failure, with the revolutionary spirit of "being determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," they repeatedly experimented and finally succeeded. This group adopted the annealing machine, greatly improving production efficiency. Now, not only have they overfulfilled the April production task, but they have also completed the May production task ahead of schedule. The revolutionary faction of this small group is advancing with victory, determined to achieve new and greater victories, to offer gifts to May Day, and to report good news to our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!

    山城贵阳尽朝辉
    ——“五一”前夕的贵阳
    凯歌阵阵，喜报频传。在全世界劳动人民的战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节到来的前夕，山城贵阳，到处呈现着一片战斗的气氛和节日的景象。无产阶级革命派的广大职工，以“只争朝夕”的精神夺取革命、生产双胜利，来迎接无产阶级革命派夺权斗争胜利后的第一个红五月。
    以新的胜利回击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派
    在贵州柴油机厂里，这几天许多车间、班组的革命职工，敲锣打鼓地向厂革命委员会送来了提前完成四月份生产计划的大红喜报：机加工车间汽缸小组，克服了人员少、任务重的困难，提前完成了四月份加工五百个汽缸头的任务，创造了建厂以来的最新纪录；装配车间以每一个班装三十八台柴油机的最高速度，提前四天完成了四月份装配任务，还抽出十多个工人支援机加工车间……。在广大革命职工的努力下，这个厂在四月二十六日就提前完成了全月生产计划，在超额完成第一季度生产任务的基础上，第二季度又首战告捷。
    贵州柴油机厂提前完成四月份生产任务是经过一番艰苦斗争的。四月中旬，这个厂的生产情况不很好，厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派便幸灾乐祸地到处煽阴风，造谣言，想看革命派的笑话。
    可是，这些资产阶级老爷们高兴得太早了。贵州柴油机厂的无产阶级革命派，在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判斗争中，更进一步把全厂革命职工联合起来了，团结起来了。他们终于在下半个月以十一天的时间，完成了全月三分之二的生产任务，给了那些资产阶级老爷们一记响亮的耳光。无产阶级革命派高唱着凯歌，欢呼毛泽东思想的又一新的胜利。
    让更多的革命群众在节日里得到毛主席画像
    在贵州新华印刷厂彩印车间里，近日来出现了一片热气腾腾的战斗场面。革命派的职工们紧张地战斗在各自的岗位上，有的在赶印着毛主席的彩色画像，有的在赶印着带有领袖像的毛主席语录标语和语录画，有的在检验产品，有的在捆扎包装……。这个车间的职工们早在二十五日就完成了四月份生产任务，现在已开始做五月份的工作了。他们为了满足“五一”节日的供应，夜以继日地在车间里劳动着。职工们豪迈地表示，一定要在节日里让更多的革命群众得到毛主席画像和毛主席语录画。
    这个车间的革命委员会负责人说：在全国吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他所代表的资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的进军号以后，车间革命委员会紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，动员全体革命职工向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，向本厂本车间党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，向他们所坚持的资产阶级反动路线，进行大揭发，大批判，大斗争。在大批判中，革命派职工更加看清楚了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，同时也认识到受蒙蔽的职工也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。一些受蒙蔽的职工也纷纷起来揭发和控诉资产阶级反动路线，表示一定要和革命派职工团结一致，共同对敌，一起“抓革命，促生产”。就在这种情况下，这个车间出现了革命和生产双胜利的一派崭新气象。
    掌了权更要活学活用毛主席著作
    近几天来，在贵州省革命委员会办公大楼门口，一队队的人不断地敲锣打鼓前来送喜报，表决心。黔江机电安装公司五十多名职工代表下班后，从十多里外的郊区赶来，代表全公司革命职工向省革命委员会报喜。他们在鲜红的喜报上写着：全公司无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的时候，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，更深入地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在四月份人力不足，任务倍增的情况下，提前三天超额完成了国家生产计划。这是毛泽东思想又一胜利，是革命派职工活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    黔江机电安装公司无产阶级革命派的职工们深切地体会到：夺权，要靠伟大的毛泽东思想；掌权，更要靠伟大的毛泽东思想。他们越是在生产繁忙的时候，越是抓紧时间学习毛主席著作。一车间铣工组除了坚持班前、会前学习毛主席著作以外，中午休息还抽出时间来进行学习。二车间管供组在试制煨管器时曾失败过二十多次，但他们每失败一次就组织大家学习毛主席的《愚公移山》等著作，以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，反复试验，最后终于获得成功。这个组采用了煨管器，生产效率大大提高，现在不仅超额完成四月份生产任务，连五月份的生产任务也提前完成了。这个小组的革命派正乘胜前进，决心夺取新的更大的胜利，向“五一”节献礼，向我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席报喜！
