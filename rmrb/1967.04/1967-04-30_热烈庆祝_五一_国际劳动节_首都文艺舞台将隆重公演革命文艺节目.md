In the decisive stage of the billion revolutionary masses launching a total offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and as the revolutionary masses across the country and the revolutionary people of the world celebrate the International Labor Day together, the capital's art stage will grandly perform a series of revolutionary art programs that shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's thoughts on art.

Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong's thoughts on art, the first batch of revolutionary model operas, which were personally cared for and supported by Comrade Jiang Qing, including the Peking operas "The Red Lantern" and "The Red Detachment of Women," the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the symphony "The Red Lantern," and the revolutionary modern drama "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," will meet the audience in an even more refined and brilliant manner. This batch of revolutionary modern dramas has withstood the unprecedented test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the scrutiny of tens of millions of revolutionary audiences, increasingly demonstrating the absolute correctness and boundless power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and revolutionary art thoughts. This batch of revolutionary model operas has set a successful example of how to correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy of pushing the old to make way for the new, letting a hundred flowers bloom, and making the past serve the present and the foreign serve China. On the proletarian's own holiday, re-performing this batch of excellent works on the proletarian art stage will greatly boost the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries and greatly dampen the arrogance of the domestic and foreign class enemies.

A batch of revolutionary song and dance programs born in the fiery struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will meet the audience with a strong fighting spirit and a fresh artistic style. Songs and dances such as "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever" and "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" praise the great leader and express the sincere feelings of the billion revolutionary people who especially revere and miss Chairman Mao on the occasion of the festival. Revolutionary songs such as "A Hundred Million People Take Up Arms to Criticize the Stinking 'Temperament'" strongly reflect the good situation of the proletarian revolutionaries in the current cultural revolution, who are high-spirited in revolutionary criticism and are bombarding the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party with a volley of fire. Programs such as "Victory Song Against Revisionism" reflect the domestic and international revolutionary people's grasp of the truth that anti-imperialism must mean anti-revisionism, their fearlessness of sacrifice, and their revolutionary will to fight revisionism to the end. Many short and brilliant programs performed by soldiers from the units, praising the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and supporting the army and loving the people, will also add luster to the festival stage. The songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, which are deeply loved by the revolutionary masses, will also resonate on the festival stage.

On the festival, the revolutionary masses will also see the performance of "The Long March Symphony" by the cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army. This large-scale symphony, based on the great revolutionary epic of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March, enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership of the Long March's victory and praises the great heroic spirit of the Red Army's soldiers and commanders, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fear no strong enemies, and bravely fight against hardships. Many programs praising the heroic figures who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, such as Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Mai Xiande, will also be performed again.

Large-scale color documentary films such as "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts - Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China," "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army," and "Chairman Mao Most Strongly Supports the Revolutionary Rebels" will also be shown in various workers' clubs and cinemas.
