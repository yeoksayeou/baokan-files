The American aggressors have launched two major "sweeps" against Xining Province in South Vietnam since early February, both ending in disastrous defeats. They lost a total of 8,300 soldiers and officers. The heroic people and soldiers of Xining, fighting fiercely, have grown stronger with each battle, and a large number of heroic warriors have emerged. The following are just a few examples.

"The Miraculous Battle"

On one day in February, a "miraculous" battle took place in the Badixi region of northwestern Xining Province. Eleven PLA soldiers, led by Pan Guangye, held off more than a hundred American invaders backed by dozens of tanks and numerous aircraft and artillery. The eleven soldiers destroyed six enemy tanks and annihilated an entire American company. The brave and clever people's warriors, however, suffered no casualties.

As the battle raged, the soldiers remained calm and flexible despite being outnumbered. Some even wrote poems praising the battle during lulls in the fighting. In this battle, soldier A Sheng captured an M-41 type tank and used its machine gun to destroy another enemy armored vehicle.

Outstanding Reconnaissance Soldiers

The reconnaissance soldiers on the Xining battlefield have performed exceptionally well. These fearless warriors sometimes climb high trees to carry out their missions and sometimes directly participate in combat, eliminating enemies many times their number. Once, just two reconnaissance teams defeated two American companies, killing sixty enemies. In another fierce battle, a reconnaissance soldier infiltrated an American command post and fired from inside, causing the enemy to flee in disarray.

The platoon leader of the "American-Killing Heroes," Wu Chunli, single-handedly destroyed two enemy tanks; squad leader A Si destroyed three enemy armored vehicles and a heavy machine gun position; deputy squad leader A Shi destroyed four enemy tanks; and artillery squad leader Yuan Qingping used six shells to destroy six enemy vehicles.

Heroic Liaison Officer A Shu, when the flames of napalm bombs were raging and shrapnel was flying everywhere, fearlessly leaped out of the trench to find the severed telephone line and quickly reconnected it. He also used his hands to extinguish the burning wires.

Close Combat Against Tanks

The soldiers of the third artillery squad, equipped with recoilless rifles, bravely employed close-quarters tactics to repeatedly defeat the enemy. They waited until the enemy tanks were only seven meters away from the trench before opening fire. In one ambush battle, they destroyed three enemy tanks. The ninth machine gun squad is also skilled in close combat. They once fought continuously for two hours, repelling a large number of enemies; when they ran out of bullets, the soldiers used grenades to destroy the enemy tanks.

The Xining Provincial Militia and Guerrilla Forces made significant contributions in coordinating with the main forces to repel the enemy's "sweeps." In one battle, female guerrilla fighter A Ping tenaciously fought against the enemy. The enemy threw six grenades at her, but she threw them back, killing dozens of American invaders. In the Samu region, a three-person guerrilla team annihilated an American platoon.

Many members of the Xining Provincial Militia and Guerrilla Forces are heroes in shooting down planes and destroying tanks. Guerrilla fighter Gao Wenda, after just learning the technique of shooting down planes, shot down an enemy helicopter. The young eighteen-year-old guerrilla fighter Yuan Wenpeng, for annihilating many enemies, was awarded the titles of "American-Killing Hero" and "Enemy Vehicle-Killing Hero."

Xining is truly a land of heroes in the south. The foolish American aggressors chose this place as a key area for their second "dry season strategic counteroffensive," thus digging their own graves. The people and soldiers of Xining are writing a brilliant and glorious song of heroes.

### 西宁战场多英雄

    西宁战场多英雄
    美国强盗从二月初以来对越南南方西宁省连续发动了两次大规模的“扫荡”，结果都以惨败而告终，共损兵折将八千三百多人。英雄的西宁军民在激烈的战斗中，愈战愈强，大批英雄战士在他们当中涌现出来。这里介绍的只是几个事例。
    “奇妙”的战斗
    今年二月的一天，西宁省西北部巴德溪地区发生一场“奇妙”的战斗：由潘光业指挥的十一名解放军战士顶住了有成十辆坦克和许多飞机、大炮掩护的上百名美国侵略者的进攻。十一名解放军战士共击毁敌人坦克六辆，全歼美军一个连。而英勇机智的人民战士却无一伤亡。
    战斗打响后，战士们在敌众我寡的不利情况下，始终镇定而灵活地坚持战斗，有的战士在战斗空隙时还写下了歌颂战斗的诗篇。在这次战斗中，战士阿胜缴获敌人M—41型坦克一辆，并用这辆坦克上的机关炮击毁敌人另一辆装甲车。
    出色的侦察员
    西宁战场上的侦察员，在战斗中表现得十分出色。这些具有大无畏精神的侦察战士，有时爬到高高的树上执行任务，有时直接参加战斗，消灭比自己多许多倍的敌人。有一次，只有两个侦察组，就击败了美军两个连，歼敌六十名；在另一次激烈的战斗中，一个侦察员潜入美军的一个指挥所，从里往外打，打得敌人狼狈不堪。
      “歼美勇士”班长武春力，一个人击毁敌人坦克两辆；排长阿思击毁敌人装甲车三辆和一个重机关炮火力点；副排长阿释击毁敌人坦克四辆；炮兵班长阮清平用六发炮弹击毁敌人军车六辆。
    英雄的联络员阿树，当凝固汽油弹的火焰正在熊熊燃烧、弹片到处横飞的时候，奋不顾身地跃出工事，找到被打断的电线，及时接好。他还用双手扑灭燃烧着的电线。
    近战打坦克
    拥有无后坐力炮的炮兵第三班的战士，大胆运用逼近的打法，连续战胜敌人。他们等敌人的坦克靠近战壕只有七米远时才猛烈开火。在一次袭击战斗中，他们一举击毁敌人坦克三辆。第九机枪组也是善于打近战的战斗单位。他们曾经连续战斗两小时，击退大批敌人；子弹打完了，战士们就用手榴弹消灭敌人的坦克。
    西宁省民兵游击队在配合主力部队粉碎敌人的“扫荡”的战斗中，也作出了巨大的贡献。在一次战斗中，女游击队员阿屏顽强地同敌人展开搏斗。敌人向她扔来六颗手榴弹，都被她扔了回去，杀死美国侵略者成十名。在沙沫地区，一个三人游击小组，消灭美军一个排。
    西宁省民兵游击队员当中有许多人是打飞机和打坦克的英雄。游击队员高文戴刚学完打飞机技术不久，就击落敌人直升飞机一架。年轻的十八岁的游击队员阮文彭由于歼灭许多敌人，获得“歼美勇士”和“打敌车勇士”的称号。
    西宁，不愧是南方的英雄土地。愚蠢的美国强盗把这里作为第二个“旱季战略反攻”的重点地区，这就为它们自己选择了新的坟场。西宁军民正在写下光辉灿烂的英雄颂歌。
