	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Deals a Heavy Blow to Imperialism, Revisionism, and Reactionaries
	Denounces Soviet Revisionism for Betraying the Interests of the World's Revolutionary People, Emphasizes that Opposing Imperialism Means Opposing Revisionism

	BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the delegation of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kansai Bureau's friendly trading companies visiting China signed a joint statement in Beijing today. The joint statement warmly praises "Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, and also the eternal red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the 700 million Chinese people, and also the guiding ideology for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world in their struggle for liberation. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries."

	The joint statement says that the delegation of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kansai Bureau's friendly trading companies visiting China believes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, is to arm the 700 million Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought, to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to ensure that China will continue to advance along the road to communism.

	The joint statement points out that the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will have an immeasurable and profound impact on the future international situation. This proletarian cultural revolution has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries, thoroughly shattering their dream of restoring capitalism in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has opened up a bright prospect for friendship and trade between the peoples of China and Japan. This is a heavy blow to the U.S., Soviet revisionism, the Japanese reactionary government, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists who have always been scheming to obstruct and sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	In discussing the current good situation of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, the joint statement points out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of the world, and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is betraying the interests of the world's revolutionary people everywhere, becoming the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. To oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism.

	The joint statement says, "Chairman Mao said: 'Apart from the monopolistic capital and militarist clique that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends.' No matter how the U.S., Soviet revisionism, the Sato government, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists obstruct and sabotage, the just cause of friendship and trade between the peoples of China and Japan will definitely break through all man-made obstacles and achieve new victories."

	Those who signed the joint statement included Vice Chairman Hou Tong of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and other representatives of this council, and the delegation leader Morii Shonen of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kansai Bureau's friendly trading companies visiting China and other members of the delegation.

	Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, attended the signing ceremony.

    中国国际贸易促进委员会
    日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部代表团签署共同声明
    中国文化大革命给帝修反以沉重打击
    谴责苏修出卖世界革命人民的利益，强调反帝必须反修
    新华社十五日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部访华友好商社代表团，今天在北京签署了一项共同声明。共同声明热烈称颂“毛主席是中国人民心中永远不落的最红的红太阳，也是全世界革命人民心中永远不落的最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是中国七亿人民的指导思想，也是全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的指导思想。毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器。”
    共同声明说，日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部访华友好商社代表团认为，伟大的领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，就是要用毛泽东思想武装七亿中国人民，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，确保中国永远沿着通向共产主义的航道胜利前进。
    共同声明指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，将给今后的国际形势以不可估量的深远影响。这场无产阶级文化大革命沉重地打击了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，彻底粉碎了他们在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦。中国无产阶级文化大革命为中日两国人民的友好和贸易展现了无限美好的前景。这对一贯蓄意阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好的美帝、苏修、日本反动政府和日共修正主义分子，是当头一棒。
    共同声明在谈到当前各国人民反帝革命斗争的大好形势时，指出美帝国主义是全世界人民的公敌，苏联修正主义领导集团到处出卖世界革命人民的利益，已经成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。反对帝国主义，必须反对现代修正主义。
    共同声明说，毛主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”不管美帝、苏修、佐藤政府和日共修正主义分子怎样阻挠、破坏，中日两国人民的友好和贸易的正义事业，一定能够冲破一切人为的障碍，不断取得新的胜利。
    在共同声明上签字的有，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主任侯桐以及这个委员会的其他代表，日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部友好商社访华代表团团长森井庄内以及代表团的成员。
    中日友好协会会长廖承志出席了签字仪式。
