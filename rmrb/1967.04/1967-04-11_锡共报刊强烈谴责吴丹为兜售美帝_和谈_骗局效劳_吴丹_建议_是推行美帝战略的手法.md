The Sri Lankan Communist Party's English weekly, *Red Flag*, published an editorial on April 9 strongly condemning United Nations Secretary-General U Thant for peddling the "peace talks" hoax plotted by U.S. imperialism during his visit to Sri Lanka and other Asian countries regarding the Vietnam issue.

The editorial pointed out: "U Thant is traveling around the world with the so-called 'peace proposal' made in the U.S., but the people of Sri Lanka have nothing to do with the lackeys of U.S. imperialism."

The editorial emphasized: "Regarding the Vietnam issue, we have only one solution: The Americans must get out of Vietnam!" "The military forces of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys must get out of Vietnam, dismantle the U.S. bases, and let the Vietnamese people freely determine their own future according to their own wishes."

The editorial in the Sinhala-language newspaper *Labor News* of the Sri Lankan Communist Party on April 8 said: U Thant's so-called 'peace proposal' is merely a tactic to implement imperialist strategy. This is a vicious attempt to turn Vietnam into a colony of U.S. imperialism."

The editorial said that the people of the world who love peace will not be fooled by U Thant. They know that U Thant is "the watchdog of world imperialism."

*Labor News* published an article on April 8 pointing out that U Thant is "nothing but a tool of the United States." "He is a running dog and faithful servant of the United States," and "now he is bringing the 'peace' hoax to Sri Lanka." "U Thant's visit is the same as Khrushchev's 'peace' tour, both serving the United States."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Colombo on April 9, Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP S. D. Bandaranaike said on April 9 when meeting with a reporter from the New China News Agency that U Thant's so-called "new proposal" on the Vietnam issue is "a deceitful lie serving the U.S. imperialist 'peace talks' hoax."

He said that U Thant's "proposal" is to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and surrender to the U.S. aggressors.

He said: "U Thant is nothing but a tool in the hands of U.S. imperialism. The United States is using this tool to try to sabotage the sacred cause of the heroic Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle and sabotage the national liberation movement. This is intolerable." He pointed out: "This plot must be thoroughly exposed to the people of the world."

He said that while the United States is expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam, it is also spreading the "peace talks" smokescreen. We must not have any illusions and always remember Chairman Mao Zedong's words: "The imperialists will never lay down their butcher's knives, nor can they become Buddhas...."

    锡共报刊强烈谴责吴丹为兜售美帝“和谈”骗局效劳
    吴丹“建议”是推行美帝战略的手法
    新华社科伦坡九日电　锡兰共产党的英文周刊《红旗》九日发表社论，强烈谴责联合国秘书长吴丹到锡兰和其他亚洲国家就越南问题兜售美帝国主义策划的“和谈”骗局。
    社论指出：“吴丹正带着‘美国造’的所谓‘和平建议’周游全世界”，但“锡兰人民同美帝仆从没有任何交道可打。”
    社论强调说：“关于越南问题，我们只有一个解决办法：美国佬！从越南滚出去！”“美帝国主义及其仆从的军队从越南滚出去，拆除美帝的基地，让越南人民按照自己的愿望自由地决定自己的前途。”
    锡兰共产党的僧伽罗文报纸《劳工报》在八日的社论中说：吴丹的“所谓‘和平建议’只不过是推行帝国主义战略的手法。这是一种凶恶的企图，要使越南变成美帝国主义的殖民地。”
    社论说，世界爱好和平的人民决不会上吴丹的当，他们知道，吴丹“是世界帝国主义的看门狗”。
    《劳工报》八日发表文章指出，吴丹“只不过是美国的工具”。“他是美国的走狗和忠实奴仆”，“现在，他正把‘和平’骗局带到锡兰”。“吴丹此行是同柯西金的‘和平’旅行是一样的，都是为美国效劳。”
    据新华社科伦坡九日电　锡兰自由党议员塞·迪·班达拉奈克九日接见新华社记者说，联合国秘书长吴丹关于越南问题的所谓“新建议”是“为美帝国主义的‘和谈’骗局效劳的欺人之谈。”
    他说，吴丹的“建议”是要越南人民放下武器，向美国侵略者屈膝投降。
    他说：“吴丹只不过是美帝国主义手中的工具。美国正在利用这个工具，企图破坏英勇的越南人民抗美救国斗争的神圣事业，破坏民族解放运动。这是不能容忍的。”他指出：“必须在全世界人民面前彻底揭露这个阴谋。”
    他说，美国一方面扩大侵越战争，另一方面却在散布“和谈”烟幕。我们不要有任何幻想，要永远记住毛泽东主席的话：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛……。”
