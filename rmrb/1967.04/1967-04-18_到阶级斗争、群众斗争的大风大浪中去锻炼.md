The top capitalist-roader within the Party, in his book *Self-Cultivation*, borrows the self-cultivation doctrines of Confucius and Mencius, advocating that Party members should shut themselves in and "examine oneself three times a day," "work hard and take it seriously to cultivate oneself." This is a reactionary subjective idealist theory of self-cultivation, a deceitful lie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; these storms are the storms of mass struggle, and this world is the world of mass struggle." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we must go through the practice of class struggle and mass struggle to temper our Party spirit. This is the fundamental path to achieving ideological transformation, and the correct way to cultivate successors to the cause of proletarian revolution.

We Communist Party members must learn to wage class struggle, grasp the laws of class struggle. Only by participating in the practice of class struggle can we learn to struggle in the struggle, learn to swim in the swimming. At the same time, only in the practice of class struggle can we better transform ourselves, becoming true communists. If we follow the methods advocated in *Self-Cultivation* to "cultivate" ourselves, shutting ourselves in a small room to "examine oneself three times a day" and "reflect in seclusion," we will become Party members who "hear nothing of the world's affairs," indifferent to politics and class struggle, becoming politically confused. We will not only be unable to fight the enemy but will be disarmed by them instead. Our company has a comrade who had such a lesson. When he was an accountant in the countryside, he followed the methods advocated in *Self-Cultivation* to "cultivate" himself. He "strengthened his will and exerted his muscles" by busying himself with work all day, his eyes never leaving the ledger, his hands never leaving the abacus, sometimes even working through the night; he "examined himself three times a day" and "reflected in seclusion," but forgot about the class struggle around him. As a result, he was unwittingly won over by a landlord element and became "friends" with the class enemy. It was only during the socialist education movement, when the lid was lifted on class struggle, that he was shocked and drew a clear line with the class enemy.

The self-cultivation advocated in *Self-Cultivation*, which advocates detachment from mass struggle, is also extremely malicious. In reality, it advocates individual struggle. We believe that the ideological transformation of a Communist Party member requires subjective effort, but it also relies on the power of the masses. Without the revolutionary struggle of the broad masses and their help, education, and supervision, it is impossible to truly achieve the goal of ideological transformation. When we actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, we have such an experience: to truly break down the "selfishness" in one's thoughts, one must bravely expose the "selfishness," trust the masses, rely on the masses, and let the masses fight this "selfishness" together with oneself. Those who do this can truly break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Otherwise, the "selfishness" will only hide deeper, and breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness will become an empty slogan. The so-called "self-cultivation" advocated in *Self-Cultivation*, which advocates detachment from mass struggle, is completely deceitful.

A thousand-mile horse cannot be trained in the courtyard, and a thousand-year pine cannot grow in a flowerpot. Let the subjective idealist theory of "door-closing cultivation" go to hell! We true Communist Party members must forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, go through the storms of class struggle and mass struggle to temper and test ourselves, and temper ourselves into reliable successors to the cause of proletarian revolution.

    到阶级斗争、群众斗争的大风大浪中去锻炼
    指导员　乔云岐　战士　孙鸿祥
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在《修养》一书中，搬出孔孟的修身养性之道，要党员关起门来“吾日三省吾身”，“下苦功夫，郑重其事地去进行自我修养”。这是一套反动的主观唯心主义的修养论，是欺人之谈。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”按照毛主席的教导，我们就是要到阶级斗争、群众斗争的实践中去进行党性锻炼，这是我们实现思想革命化的根本道路，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的正确途径。
    我们共产党员要学会搞阶级斗争，掌握阶级斗争的规律，只有参加到阶级斗争的实践中去，在斗争中学会斗争，在游泳中学会游泳。同时，只有在阶级斗争的实践中，才能更好地改造自己，使自己成为一个真正的共产主义战士。如果按照《修养》一书中所提倡的脱离阶级斗争的方法去“修养”，成天坐在小屋子里“吾日三省吾身”，“闭门思过”，那我们的党员就会“两耳不闻天下事”，不关心政治，不关心阶级斗争，就会变成政治上的糊涂人，不但不能对敌人进行斗争，相反还会被敌人解除武装。我们连里有个同志就有过这样的教训。他在农村当会计时，就曾经按照《修养》一书所提倡的方法去“修养”。他“苦其心志，劳其筋骨”地整天忙业务，眼不离帐本，手不离算盘，有时还打通宵；他“吾日三省吾身”地“闭门思过”，可就是忘记了自己周围的阶级斗争。结果不知不觉地被一个地主分子拉拢，和阶级敌人交了“朋友”。直到社会主义教育运动，揭开了阶级斗争的盖子，他才大吃一惊，和阶级敌人划清了界限。
    《修养》一书提倡脱离群众斗争的“修养”，也是十分恶毒的，实际上是在提倡个人奋斗，我们认为，一个共产党员的思想改造，要依靠主观上的努力，同时还要依靠群众的力量。离开广大群众的革命斗争，离开群众的帮助、教育和监督，是不可能真正达到改造思想的目的的。我们在活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想破私立公的时候，就深有这样的体会：要真正破自己思想上的“私”字，就必须勇敢地把“私”字“亮”出来，相信群众，依靠群众，让群众和自己一起来同这个“私”字斗。凡是这样做了的，就能真正破私立公。否则，“私”字就会越藏越深，破私立公就成了一句空话。《修养》一书提倡的脱离群众斗争的所谓“修养”，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    庭院里遛不出千里马，花盆里长不出万年松。让主观唯心主义的“关门修养”论见鬼去吧！我们真正的共产党员，就是要永远遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，到阶级斗争、群众斗争的大风大浪中去锻炼考验，把自己锻炼成可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
