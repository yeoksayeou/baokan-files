Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" and inspired by the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," the revolutionary workers and cadres in Harbin, a major industrial center in northern China, are full of fighting spirit. The industrial and transportation fronts are thriving, and a new high tide of revolution and production is rapidly rising. The situation on the industrial and transportation fronts in the entire city is excellent and getting better every day.

Since the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Harbin's industrial and transportation sectors seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in January this year, they have bravely taken on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. They have smashed the counterattacks of the class enemies, overcome numerous obstacles, and achieved victories in both revolution and production. In recent days, good news of production has been pouring in from all over the city, and new production records have been continuously set. Many enterprises' revolutionary workers, with the spirit of masters of the state, have completed or overfulfilled the March production plans set by the state. The city's total industrial output value in March has increased significantly compared to February. The production levels of key industries such as power boilers, railway transport vehicles, bearings, instruments, measuring tools and cutting tools, insulating materials, agricultural machinery, and light industry have been rising month by month, with some products showing growth or significant growth compared to the same period last year.

The first important sign of the current excellent situation on Harbin's industrial and transportation fronts is that Chairman Mao's great line of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people. The great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly transforming into immense material force. Revolutionary workers and cadres have seriously studied and discussed the letter from the Central Committee, and they are full of spirit and enthusiasm, eager to respond to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's great call with actual actions, determined to be pioneers of the revolution and models of production.

A large number of facts show that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of production. In many factories, mines, and enterprises, where revolution is given priority and production is guided by revolution, the revolution is vigorous and production is steadily increasing. The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory, during the intense struggle for power and after seizing power, have always firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," and have firmly grasped the central link of guiding production with revolution. The Red Guards, with the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, have been transforming and managing the enterprise. They have thoroughly smashed the outdated rules and habits that do not suit the socialist economic base and hinder the development of productive forces. Revolutionary workers and cadres say: We must completely uproot the roots of revisionism. We must be cadres like Jiao Yulu and workers like Lei Feng. The new leadership of the factory and the broad revolutionary cadres and technical personnel have all gone to the production front lines, working and promoting production at the same time. New people and new things are constantly emerging. After completing the production plans ahead of schedule for two consecutive months, the factory again overfulfilled the monthly plan in March, with the total output value increasing by more than 30% compared to the previous month. The Harbin Boiler Factory, Harbin Tractor Parts Factory, and Harbin Bicycle Factory have also achieved outstanding results in production due to their firm grasp of the revolution and vigorous promotion of production. The Harbin Boiler Factory's output value in February was double that of January, and in March, it increased by 57% compared to February, setting a new high production level in recent years. The labor productivity per capita was 32% higher than the same period last year.

In the midst of the fervor of grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a new high tide.

The second important sign of the excellent situation on Harbin's industrial and transportation fronts is that many enterprises' revolutionary masses, by firmly implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have established revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organs through the "three-in-one combination" of revolution. These organs have played a huge role in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

The third important sign of the excellent situation on Harbin's industrial and transportation fronts is that the People's Liberation Army has greatly assisted the local areas and supported industrial production work. The Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Heilongjiang Province, and the municipal armed forces have all strengthened their support for Harbin's industrial production. Some key enterprises or units with weak leadership have seen a new and lively situation in both revolution and production with the help of cadres sent by the People's Liberation Army. The Harbin Dong'an Machinery Factory, Harbin Electrical Instrument Factory, Harbin Bearing Factory, and Harbin Railway Locomotive Depot have all quickly turned around their production situations with the help of the PLA soldiers. The Dong'an Machinery Factory overfulfilled the March production plan and made up for the shortfall in February, thus successfully completing the first quarter plan. The Electrical Instrument Factory also overfulfilled the March plan, with the total output value exceeding the sum of the first two months.

    哈尔滨工交战线革命职工革命干部斗志昂扬
    革命形势大好　生产捷报频传
    三月份工业总产值比二月份有较大增长，生产新纪录不断涌现
    据新华社哈尔滨三日电　在毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》的鼓舞下，我国北方重要工业中心哈尔滨市的广大革命职工、革命干部斗志昂扬，工业、交通战线呈现出一派欣欣向荣的大好形势。一个抓革命、促生产的新高潮正在迅速兴起，全市工交战线的形势好得很，而且越来越好。
    哈尔滨工交战线的无产阶级革命派今年一月夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，粉碎了阶级敌人的反扑，克服重重障碍，接连取得了革命、生产双胜利。连日来，全市生产捷报频传，生产新纪录不断涌现。许多企业的革命职工以国家主人翁的豪迈气概，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，完成或超额完成了三月份国家生产计划。全市三月份的工业总产值比二月份有了较大幅度的提高。动力锅炉、铁路运输车辆、轴承、仪表、量具和刃具、绝缘材料、农业机械、轻工等主要工业的生产水平逐月上升，其中有些产品比去年同期有增长或较多的增长。
    哈尔滨市工交战线当前大好形势的第一个重要标志是：毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，愈来愈深入人心。毛泽东思想的伟大精神力量正在迅速转化为巨大的物质力量。广大革命职工、革命干部认真学习、讨论了党中央的信，人们意气风发，干劲倍增，纷纷表示坚决用实际行动响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，誓做革命的闯将，生产的模范。
    大量的事实表明，无产阶级文化大革命是促进生产发展的强大动力。在许多厂矿企业，凡是把革命放在首位，以革命统帅生产，那里的革命就轰轰烈烈，生产也节节上升。哈尔滨林业机械厂的革命职工，在夺权和掌权的紧张斗争中，一直牢牢记住毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，紧紧抓住以革命统帅生产这个中心环节。红色造反者以无产阶级的革命精神来改造企业、管理企业，大破不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑和束缚生产力发展的陈规陋习。革命工人和革命干部们说：我们一定要把修正主义的根子彻底拔掉。我们当干部要当焦裕禄那样的干部，当工人要当雷锋那样的工人。这个厂新的领导班子的成员以及广大革命干部和技术人员，都深入生产第一线，一边劳动一边抓生产，新人新事不断涌现。全厂在连续两个月超额完成生产计划以后，三月份又超额完成了月计划，总产值比上月增长百分之三十多。哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂、哈尔滨自行车厂的无产阶级革命派由于狠抓革命，猛促生产，生产也搞得很出色。哈尔滨锅炉厂二月份完成的产值比一月份增加了两倍，三月完成的产值又比二月增长百分之五十七，创造了最近几年月的最高生产水平。全员劳动生产率比去年同期提高百分之三十二。
    在狠抓革命、猛促生产的热潮中，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的高潮。
    哈尔滨市工业交通战线形势大好的第二个重要标志是：许多企业的无产阶级革命派由于坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，实行革命的“三结合”，建立起了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这些机构，在抓革命、促生产中发挥了巨大的作用。
    哈尔滨市工交战线形势大好的第三个重要标志是：人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作。黑龙江省军区、人民解放军驻黑龙江省部队和市武装部门，都大力加强了对哈尔滨市工业生产的支持。一些重点企业或领导薄弱的单位，在人民解放军派出的干部的帮助下，革命和生产都出现一片热气腾腾的新气象。哈尔滨东安机械厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂、哈尔滨轴承厂、哈尔滨铁路机务段等单位，在解放军指战员的帮助下，生产都很快改变了局面。东安机械厂超额完成了三月份的生产计划，把二月份欠产的也补上了，从而胜利地完成了第一季度计划。电表仪器厂也超额完成了三月份计划，总产值比一、二两月完成的总和还多。
