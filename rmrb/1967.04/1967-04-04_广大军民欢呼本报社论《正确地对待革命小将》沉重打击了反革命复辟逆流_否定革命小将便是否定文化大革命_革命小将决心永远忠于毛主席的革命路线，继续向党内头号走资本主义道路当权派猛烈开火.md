The editorial "Correctly Treat the Revolutionary Youngsters" published in the People's Daily has greatly encouraged the revolutionary youngsters and the broad revolutionary masses in various places. They unanimously pointed out that the publication of this editorial is a heavy blow to the current trend of counter-revolutionary restoration. The broad revolutionary youngsters solemnly declare to Chairman Mao: We must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the struggle to criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow all the counter-revolutionary revisionist theories of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, achieving new great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the publication of the editorial in the People's Daily, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in various places have held discussions and symposiums. Based on their personal experiences, they highly praised the immortal achievements of the revolutionary youngsters in the Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically sang the praises of the revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought who have grown and tempered in the stormy waves of class struggle. They said: The broad revolutionary youngsters are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. They have always embodied the revolutionary direction and are worthy successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and be the strong backing of the revolutionary youngsters, fighting and winning together with them. The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Port Command Department said during their study and discussion of this editorial: In the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters followed Chairman Mao closely, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and severely struck the bourgeois reactionary line. In the storm of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, they fought alongside us and successfully carried out the struggle for power. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to revolutionize, full of vigor and creativity. They are the hope of our proletarian revolutionary cause. Li Zaichan, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and Deputy Political Commissar of the Guizhou Military Region, said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "China needs a large number of such vanguard elements. The tasks of the Chinese revolution can then be smoothly accomplished." The revolutionary youngsters are precisely such vanguard elements tempered in the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must respect them and learn from them. Respecting them is respecting the revolutionary masses; learning from them is learning from the revolutionary masses. He said, although the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been established for only over a month, it has shown strong vitality. The reason is that we have faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy and fully played the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders. Among these leaders, there is a part that are revolutionary youngsters. They are outstanding elements who have shared the same breath and fate with the revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are heroes tested in the great class struggle. Yuan Zhen, member of the Shanxi Core Group and Deputy Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said, the revolutionary youngsters listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and most resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, daring to sacrifice themselves and daring to pull down the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The revolutionary youngsters have made immortal achievements in the Cultural Revolution. However, now there is a trend of counter-revolutionary restoration, and some people with ulterior motives seize the mistakes and shortcomings of the revolutionary youngsters, exaggerate them, spread rumors, and maliciously slander, attempting to stage a comeback and negate the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. We revolutionary cadres will not allow this. We will resolutely fight alongside the revolutionary youngsters, repel this counter-revolutionary trend, and defeat the enemy's counterattack.

The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres pointed out that to negate the revolutionary youngsters is to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; to strike at the revolutionary youngsters is to strike at the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xinghuo Commune in Beijing's Chaoyang District said, we firmly support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youngsters, and we will wholeheartedly help them with their shortcomings. Whoever dares to belittle the achievements of the revolutionary youngsters, we will firmly fight them to the end. Mu Lin, a standing committee member of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said: The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are trying every means to strike at the revolutionary youngsters, which we absolutely cannot allow. We must thoroughly expose the plot of the capitalist-roaders within the Party to sow discord between the revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary cadres. We must resolutely stand with the revolutionary youngsters and open fire on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, overthrow and expose him, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! The broad revolutionary masses also angrily exposed the attempt of some to shift the blame of the "strike a large area, protect a small clique" policy on cadre issues by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party onto the revolutionary youngsters. Hou Liping, former secretary of the general branch of the Geophysical Prospecting System of Beijing Geological Institute and recently elected member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Geological Institute, said: I have personally suffered the persecution of the "strike a large area, protect a small clique" policy proposed by the proponent of the bourgeois reactionary line. This account should be settled with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. Some people with ulterior motives maliciously try to pin the blame on the Dongfanghong Commune revolutionary youngsters in our institute, which we firmly do not allow. Wang Jiayi, a model soldier from a certain unit of the Harbin garrison, said: The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party collude with the ghosts and snakes in society, seize the shortcomings of the revolutionary youngsters, attack one point, and ignore the rest. We must resolutely counterattack and thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary restoration trend. The People's Liberation Army is the strongest backing of the revolutionary youngsters. Whoever dares to attack the revolutionary youngsters, whoever dares to oppose the revolutionary youngsters, whoever dares to touch a hair of the revolutionary youngsters, we will show no mercy!

After seeing the editorial in the People's Daily, revolutionary youngsters in various places held meetings and parades. They repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Many revolutionary youngsters said, this editorial has made us more deeply understand our historical mission. Chairman Mao loves and supports us so much, so we must correctly treat ourselves, seeing both our achievements and our shortcomings and mistakes. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, humbly learn from revolutionary cadres and the People's Liberation Army, unite with workers and peasants, and while seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, seize the power of the "self" in our minds, constantly overcome non-proletarian thoughts such as windbaggery, sectarianism, anarchism, and individualism, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, closely follow Chairman Mao, and carry the revolution through to the end. The revolutionary youngsters of the Red Rebel Team of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute said: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and will not rest until we overthrow, smash, and expose him!

    广大军民欢呼本报社论《正确地对待革命小将》沉重打击了反革命复辟逆流
    否定革命小将便是否定文化大革命
    革命小将决心永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，继续向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火
    新华社三日讯　《人民日报》社论《正确地对待革命小将》发表后，极大地鼓舞了各地的革命小将和广大革命群众。他们一致指出，这篇社论的发表，是对当前出现的一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流的沉重打击。广大革命小将激动地向毛主席宣誓：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判的旗帜，积极投入批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的战斗，和广大革命群众一起把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一切反革命修正主义理论批深、批透、批倒、批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利。
    各地广大革命群众、革命干部、解放军指战员在《人民日报》社论发表后，纷纷进行讨论、座谈。他们以自己的切身感受，高度赞扬革命小将在文化大革命中立下的不朽功勋，热情歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青少年在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。他们说：广大革命小将是文化大革命的急先锋，他们始终体现了革命的大方向，不愧为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。我们一定听毛主席的话，做革命小将的坚强后盾，永远同他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。上海市革命造反总司令部海港指挥部的革命职工们在学习讨论这篇社论时说：革命小将在文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，狠狠打击资产阶级反动路线。在上海“一月革命”的风暴中，他们和我们一起胜利地开展了夺权斗争。他们敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命，朝气蓬勃，具有无限的创造力，他们是我们无产阶级革命事业胜利的希望。贵州省革命委员会主任委员、贵州省军区副政治委员李再含说，毛主席教导我们：“中国要有一大群这样的先锋分子，中国革命的任务就能够顺利地解决。”革命的小将们，就是在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中锻炼出来的这样的先锋分子。我们一定要尊重他们，向他们学习。尊重他们，就是尊重革命群众；向他们学习，也就是向革命群众学习。他说，贵州省革命委员会虽然成立才一个多月的时间，但却显示出了强大的生命力。其原因就是由于我们忠实地执行了毛主席指示的革命的“三结合”的方针，充分地发挥了革命群众组织负责人的作用。这些负责人中，有一部分就是革命小将，他们是在无产阶级文化大革命中，与革命群众同呼吸共命运的优秀分子，是在阶级斗争的大搏斗中考验出来的英雄。中共山西核心小组成员、山西省革命委员会副主任委员袁振说，革命小将们最听毛主席的话，最坚决地捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，舍得一身剐，敢把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马。革命小将在文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋。可是，现在有一股资本主义反革命复辟的逆流，一些别有用心的人抓住革命小将的一些错误缺点，加以夸大，造谣中伤，妄图反攻倒算，否定文化大革命的成果。我们革命的领导干部坚决不答应。我们坚决和革命小将们战斗在一起，击退这股反革命逆流，打垮阶级敌人的反扑。
    广大革命群众和革命干部指出，否定革命小将，便是否定无产阶级文化大革命；打击革命小将，便是打击无产阶级文化大革命。北京市朝阳区星火公社的贫下中农说，对于革命小将的革命行动我们坚决支持，对于革命小将的缺点我们要满腔热情地进行帮助。谁敢抹杀革命小将的功绩，我们就坚决和他斗到底。山东省革命委员会常委穆林说：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计打击革命小将，我们是绝对不能允许的。我们一定要彻底揭穿党内走资本主义道路当权派挑拨革命小将和革命干部关系的阴谋。我们要坚决地和革命小将们站在一起，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派开火，把他批倒斗臭，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！广大革命群众还愤怒地揭露了有人妄图把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上搞的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪行，强加到革命小将头上。北京地质学院地球物理勘探系前总支书记、最近被选为地质学院革命委员会委员的侯力平说：我亲身遭受过资产阶级反动路线提出者搞的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的迫害。这笔账要算在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派身上，某些别有用心的人妄图把罪名强加在我院东方红公社革命小将身上，我们坚决不答应。哈尔滨驻军某部五好战士王家义说：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，抓住革命小将的某些缺点，攻其一点，不及其余。对于这股反革命复辟逆流，我们一定要坚决回击，彻底粉碎。人民解放军是革命小将的最坚强的后盾。谁敢攻击革命小将，谁敢反对革命小将，谁敢动革命小将一根毫毛，我们决不留情！
    各地革命小将看到《人民日报》社论以后，纷纷举行集会和游行。他们一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多革命小将说，这篇社论使我们更深刻地认识到自己肩负的历史使命。毛主席这样爱护我们，支持我们，我们就更要正确地对待自己，既要看到自己的成绩，又要看到自己的缺点错误。我们一定要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们一定要更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，虚心向革命干部和人民解放军学习，同工农相结合，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，不断地克服风头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想，破私立公，紧紧跟着毛主席，将革命进行到底。哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团的革命小将们说：我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，不把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，誓不罢休！
