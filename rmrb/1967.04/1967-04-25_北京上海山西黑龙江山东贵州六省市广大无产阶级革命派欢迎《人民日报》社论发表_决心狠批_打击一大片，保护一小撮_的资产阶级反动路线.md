Revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Guizhou provinces and municipalities warmly welcome the publication of the People's Daily editorial "Why We Must Focus on Criticizing the 'Strike a Large Number, Protect a Few' Bourgeois Reactionary Line as a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres in various places enthusiastically applaud the publication of the People's Daily editorial "Why We Must Focus on Criticizing the 'Strike a Large Number, Protect a Few' Bourgeois Reactionary Line as a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line." They said, "This editorial is timely and necessary. It points out the current direction and key points of the struggle. We will definitely carry it out!"

Revolutionary cadres in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Guizhou provinces and municipalities, who have already achieved victory in the struggle for power, have studied today's editorial of the People's Daily in conjunction with their practical struggles. They emphasized that in the current mass criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must focus on criticizing their bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few" in personnel matters. Only in this way can we better combine the revolutionary mass criticism with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our region and unit, truly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, promote the great alliance of revolutionary cadres, achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and achieve a thorough victory in the struggle for power, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The editorial of the People's Daily today is excellent! The revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in the capital enthusiastically welcome the publication of this editorial. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres of Tsinghua University, who have deeply suffered from the poison of the "strike a large number, protect a few" bourgeois reactionary line of the No. 1 power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, pointed out at a mass rally held today that the People's Daily editorial speaks the hearts of the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses. The soldiers of the Jinggangshan Detachment of Tsinghua University expressed: We are the defenders and executors of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. We will resolutely and thoroughly criticize the "strike a large number, protect a few" bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly eliminate the anarchist thoughts of "overthrow everything, doubt everything" spread by the formulators of the bourgeois reactionary line. All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary cadres must unite and concentrate our firepower on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line. In the great criticism, we will achieve the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. A committee member of the former Party branch of the Tsinghua University preparatory school said, "Cadres coming out" means constantly revolutionizing oneself in the life-and-death struggle between the two lines and resolutely fighting against the bourgeois reactionary line. I am determined to fully devote myself to the current mass criticism movement, to share the same breath and destiny with the revolutionary cadres, to deeply touch my soul, to break private interests and establish public interests, to consciously revolutionize, and to transform myself. The revolutionary teachers and students of the New Peking University said, We proletarian revolutionaries must eliminate the influence of the erroneous idea of "neither left nor right." We must analyze cadres with a class standpoint in an objective and truth-seeking manner, and help cadres who are willing to revolutionize to come out and "come out." For the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who generally exclude and overthrow cadres, and attempt to protect themselves, we will thoroughly expose and criticize their conspiracies. Some responsible comrades of the Beijing Revolutionary Workers' Congress said: It is a very important combat task to focus on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in personnel matters at present. We will definitely carry it out. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road attempt to bring down the broad revolutionary cadres. We will not agree to this by a thousand times, by ten thousand times.

The editorial of the People's Daily was warmly received in Shanghai, sparking strong reactions among the broad revolutionary cadres. The revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Bureau, who are currently criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in personnel matters, said with deep feelings, "The publication of this editorial by the People's Daily is very timely and necessary. We are determined to immediately take practical actions to fully implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, help revolutionary leading cadres stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieve the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." Revolutionary teachers and students of Fudan University said, At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deliberately shifted the target of struggle, listing more than 200 cadres within the school as targets of attack, and labeling some daring revolutionary cadres as "monsters and demons," sending them to labor reform teams. Their purpose of spreading white terror to the broad cadres and masses was precisely to protect the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road within the school and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and to protect their backer, the No. 1 power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. We proletarian revolutionaries must thoroughly criticize this reactionary line and settle its heinous crimes.

The broad revolutionary cadres and masses in Harbin expressed their determination to highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to fully implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and to thoroughly criticize the "strike a large number, protect a few" bourgeois reactionary line with the spirit of "seizing the day," eliminating the influence of anarchist trends. A responsible comrade of the Harbin Revolutionary Committee said: Whether we can correctly handle cadres is a question of what attitude we take towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a question of whether we stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly grasp the weapon of class analysis. In the great storms of the struggle between the two lines, we must carefully examine and identify cadres, correctly handle cadres, thoroughly criticize the "strike a large number, protect a few" bourgeois reactionary line, and engage in a head-on struggle with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, forming a mighty revolutionary army to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province believe that the editorial of the People's Daily is a great encouragement and support to the proletarian revolutionaries. A leading member of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee, Wang Chengbin, said, In the current mass criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must definitely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and actively support and enthusiastically help revolutionary cadres to revolutionize. We must follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "be good at identifying cadres," on the one hand, mobilize the masses to fully analyze cadres from a class perspective and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions; on the other hand, we must propagate Chairman Mao's policy on cadres to cadres, do in-depth and detailed ideological work, and help cadres who have made mistakes to stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A standing committee member of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and a revolutionary youngster, Song Jie, said, The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, and attempt to pin the crime of "striking a large number and protecting a few" on the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary youngsters. This is simply the thief crying "catch the thief," nonsense. We proletarian revolutionaries are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must always pay attention to uniting the majority in the struggle and resolutely striking a few. A fine spinner from the No. 1 and 26 Textile Mill (formerly Taiyuan Textile Mill), Xie Yue, said: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in our factory crazily pushed the reactionary policy of "striking a large number and protecting a few" during the Cultural Revolution, labeling a large number of cadres as "rightists" and "anti-party elements," attempting to protect themselves with this. However, their conspiracy was quickly exposed by us revolutionary workers. Now, our entire factory is launching a great criticism of China's Khrushchev. We must combine the specific situation of our unit and department to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the bourgeois reactionary policy of "striking a large number and protecting a few"!

After the editorial of the People's Daily was transmitted to Guiyang, the Guiyang Cotton Mill held a full-staff meeting to study this editorial. Many department and workshop cadres exposed and criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few" in personnel matters at the meeting. Some cadres who had previously executed the bourgeois reactionary line exposed and denounced the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" of the No. 1 power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road at the meeting, sincerely thanked the comrades of the proletarian revolutionaries for their help, and were determined to stand out and revolutionize in the great criticism movement, contribute their strength to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mend their ways, and make amends for their mistakes. A standing committee member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and former deputy director of the Office of the Political Department of the Provincial Industrial and Transportation Commission, Wang Yunrong, said, This editorial points the way for us proletarian revolutionaries. He said, The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the former Guizhou Provincial Party Committee stubbornly implemented the "strike a large number, protect a few" bourgeois reactionary line of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the early stage of the Cultural Revolution, labeling a large number of cadres as "anti-party elements" and "monsters and demons," attempting to protect themselves. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line in personnel matters, unite the vast majority of revolutionary cadres, better achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and achieve a thorough victory in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries.

The comrades of the "Marching Forward" Red Guard Detachment of Mao Zedong Thought at Lu Xun University in Jinan, Shandong, said, "The editorial of the People's Daily is excellent! It greatly boosts the morale of our revolutionary cadres and greatly dampens the spirits of the class enemies. It has great guiding significance for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is being vigorously carried out nationwide. We must study it deeply and thoroughly and carry it out without any deviation."

    北京上海山西黑龙江山东贵州六省市广大无产阶级革命派欢迎《人民日报》社论发表
    决心狠批“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线
    据新华社二十四日讯　各地广大的无产阶级革命派，热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论《为什么要着重批判
  “打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分》的发表。他们说，这篇社论来得好，来得及时，它指出了当前斗争的大方向和重要环节，我们一定坚决照办！
    已经取得夺权斗争胜利的北京、上海、山西、黑龙江、山东、贵州六个省市的许多无产阶级革命派战士，结合他们的斗争实践学习了今天《人民日报》的社论。他们强调指出，在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的群众性大批判中，一定要着重批判他们在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，只有这样才能把革命的大批判同本地区、本单位的斗批改任务更好地结合起来，真正贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推进无产阶级革命派的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，取得夺权斗争的彻底胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    《人民日报》今天的社论好得很，好极了！首都的广大革命群众、红卫兵小将和革命干部，纷纷欢呼这篇社论的发表。深受党内头号走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线毒害的清华大学广大革命师生和革命干部，在今天举行的群众大会上指出，《人民日报》社论说出了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的心里话。清华大学井冈山兵团战士纷纷表示：我们是毛主席干部政策的维护者和执行者。我们就是要理直气壮地彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，坚决肃清资产阶级反动路线制订者散布的“打倒一切，怀疑一切”的无政府主义思想。一切革命的同志和革命的干部要团结起来，共同对敌，把火力集中指向提出资产阶级反动路线的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在大批判中实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。清华大学前分校党总支一位委员说，干部“亮相”，就是要在两条路线的生死搏斗中不断革自己的命，同资产阶级反动路线作坚决斗争。我决心全身心地投入到当前群众性的大批判运动当中去，同革命派同呼吸，共命运，狠触自己的灵魂，不断破私立公，自觉革命，改造自己。新北大的革命师生们说，我们无产阶级革命派必须肃清宁“左”勿右的错误观念的影响，用阶级观点对干部作实事求是的分析，帮助愿意革命的干部站出来“亮相”。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对干部一概排斥，一概打倒，妄图保护自己过关的阴谋，我们就是要彻底揭露，彻底批判。北京革命职工代表会议的一些负责人说：当前着重批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，是一项十分重要的战斗任务，我们坚决执行。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派妄图把广大革命干部打下去，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    《人民日报》社论传到上海后，引起了广大无产阶级革命派的强烈反响。正在批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的上海市水产局机关无产阶级革命派深有体会地说，《人民日报》这篇社论发表得非常及时，非常必要。我们决心立即以实际行动，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，帮助革命的领导干部站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。复旦大学的革命师生说，复旦大学在无产阶级文化大革命开始时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就蓄意转移斗争目标，把学校内二百多名干部排入名单作为打击对象，还把一些敢于起来造反的干部打成“牛鬼蛇神”，送入劳改队。他们对广大干部和群众实行白色恐怖的目的，正是为了保护学校里和上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保护他们的后台党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。我们无产阶级革命派一定要彻底批判这条反动路线，清算它的滔天罪行。
    哈尔滨市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众表示，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，以“只争朝夕”的精神彻底批判
  “打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，肃清无政府主义思潮的影响。哈尔滨市革命委员会的一位负责同志说：能否正确地对待干部，是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线采取什么态度的问题，是真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的问题。我们无产阶级革命派必须牢牢掌握阶级分析的武器，在两条路线斗争的大风大浪中，认真考察和识别干部，正确对待干部，彻底地批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行针锋相对的斗争，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    山西省广大无产阶级革命派认为，《人民日报》社论对无产阶级革命派是极大的鼓舞和支持。太原市革命委员会领导成员王承珺说，在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，积极支持和热情帮助革命干部起来革命。我们要遵照毛主席“必须善于识别干部”的教导，一方面放手发动群众，对干部进行全面的阶级分析，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾；一方面要向干部宣传毛主席的干部政策，做深入细致的思想工作，帮助犯错误的干部站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。山西省革命委员会常委、革命小将宋捷说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派颠倒是非，混淆黑白，妄图把“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪名强加到无产阶级革命派和革命小将头上，这简直是贼喊捉贼，胡说八道。我们无产阶级革命派无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一定要在斗争中始终注意团结大多数，坚决打击一小撮。太原一·二六纺织厂（原太原纺织厂）细纱挡车工解悦说：我们厂的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文化大革命中疯狂地推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，把大批干部打成了“右派”、“反党分子”，妄图以此来保护他们自己。但是，他们的阴谋很快被我们革命工人识破了。现在，我们全厂正在展开对中国的赫鲁晓夫的大批判，我们一定要结合本单位、本部门的具体情况，把“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动政策彻底批倒、批臭、批垮！
    《人民日报》社论传到贵阳以后，贵阳棉纺厂召开全厂干部大会学习了这篇社论。许多科室、车间干部在会上揭发和批判了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。一些曾经执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，在会上揭发和控诉了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》对他们的毒害，衷心感谢无产阶级革命派的同志对他们的帮助，决心在大批判运动中站出来革命，为无产阶级文化大革命贡献自己的力量，痛改前非，将功补过。贵州省革命委员会常委、原省委工交政治部办公室副主任王运荣说，这篇社论给我们无产阶级革命派指出了方向。他说，前贵州省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在文化大革命运动初期顽固地执行党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把大批干部打成“反党分子”、“牛鬼蛇神”，妄图把他们自己保护起来。我们一定要彻底肃清在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，团结绝大多数革命干部，更好地实现革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的彻底胜利。
    山东济南鲁迅大学毛泽东思想红卫兵“进军号”战斗队的同志们说，《人民日报》的社论好极了！它大长了我们革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，对全国正在轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，有巨大的指导意义，我们一定要学深学透，不折不扣地照办。
