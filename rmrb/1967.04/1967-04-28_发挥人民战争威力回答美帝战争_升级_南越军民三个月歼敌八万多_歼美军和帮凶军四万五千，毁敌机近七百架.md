Heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians, in the first quarter of this year, fought bravely, mobilizing the power of people's war, and dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys who were frantically expanding their war of aggression against Vietnam. They achieved brilliant victories.

According to a recent communiqué from the Command of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, incomplete statistics show that the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces killed, wounded, and captured more than 80,000 enemy troops in the first three months of this year, including 45,000 U.S. aggressors and lackeys. Among the enemy troops annihilated were 32 battalions and 96 companies completely wiped out, including 4 U.S. infantry battalions, 13 armored battalions, 5 artillery battalions, 8 puppet infantry battalions, 1 armored battalion, and 1 South Korean mercenary infantry battalion. In the first three months of this year, the Liberation Armed Forces also shot down and destroyed 686 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed nearly 2,000 military vehicles (including 1,273 tanks and armored vehicles), destroyed 156 pieces of heavy artillery, and sank 30 enemy ships.

During these three months, the Liberation Armed Forces continued to maintain the initiative on the battlefield, foiling multiple attacks launched by the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys against the liberated areas. This completely thwarted the U.S. imperialists' plan to destroy the liberated areas, annihilate the main forces of the Liberation Armed Forces, and "pacify" the villages. The large-scale "sweeps" launched by the U.S. aggressors in the areas around Saigon, the Central Highlands, and the Quảng Trị–Thừa Thiên region south of the 17th parallel all ended in complete failure. From early February to early April, the U.S. aggressors launched three large-scale "sweeps" in the Ninh Thuan province, resulting in 13,550 enemy troops killed or wounded, including two infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and nine armored battalions completely wiped out. Additionally, 801 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 90 pieces of heavy artillery, and 167 aircraft were destroyed. The U.S. First, Twenty-Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth Infantry Divisions, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, and the Eleventh Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment all suffered heavy casualties.

The Liberation Armed Forces also frequently attacked enemy bases and outposts, ambushed enemy troops, destroyed many enemy bases, and annihilated a large number of enemy troops. Guerrilla warfare in various regions also saw new developments.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have rapidly grown and strengthened, especially the continuous growth of the Liberation Armed Forces' artillery, making the U.S. puppet and mercenary forces even more terrified. The great victories won by the Liberation Armed Forces on various battlefields have basically thwarted the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season counteroffensive" plan, causing their "pincer movement" to fail from the start. This has laid a good foundation for achieving greater victories throughout 1967.

The Command of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces stated in this communiqué that the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy losses, but they have not given up their arrogant ambitions of aggression. The communiqué calls on the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces and people to continue their brave fighting, while remaining vigilant and thwarting all new enemy plots, ensuring that the enemy's new plans of aggression meet with complete failure.

    发挥人民战争威力回答美帝战争“升级”
    南越军民三个月歼敌八万多
    歼美军和帮凶军四万五千，毁敌机近七百架
    据新华社河内二十七日电　英雄的越南南方军民在今年第一季度里，英勇奋战，发挥人民战争的威力，沉重地打击了疯狂扩大侵越战争的美国侵略强盗及其走狗，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    据越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近发表的公报说，据不完全的统计，越南南方解放武装力量今年头三个月共打死、打伤和俘虏敌军八万多名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四万五千多名。在被歼灭的敌军中有三十二个营和九十六个连被全歼，其中包括美军四个步兵营、十三个装甲营、五个炮兵营，伪军八个步兵营、一个装甲营，南朝鲜帮凶军一个步兵营。在今年头三个月，解放武装力量还击落和击毁各种敌机六百八十六架，击毁各种军车近两千辆（其中包括坦克和装甲车一千二百七十三辆），击毁各种重炮一百五十六门，击沉舰艇三十艘。
    在这三个月中，解放武装力量继续保持着战场上的主动权，粉碎了美国侵略军及其走狗对解放区发动的多次进攻，使美帝国主义妄图破坏解放区、消灭解放武装力量主力和“绥靖乡村”的侵略计划，全部遭到破产。美国侵略军在西贡周围、中部高原和十七度线以南广治—承天地区等战场上发动的多次大规模“扫荡”，都以彻底失败告终。美国侵略军从二月初到四月初对西宁省发动三次大规模“扫荡”，被解放武装力量打死打伤一万三千五百五十名，其中包括两个步兵营、两个炮兵营和九个装甲营被全歼。此外，还被击毁坦克和装甲车八百零一辆、重炮九十多门，被击落飞机一百六十七架。参加这几次“扫荡”的美国第一、第二十五、第四和第九步兵师，第一七三空降旅、第一九六轻步兵旅和第十一独立装甲团都遭到了严重的伤亡。
    解放武装力量还频频袭击敌军的基地和据点，伏击敌军，破坏敌军许多基地，摧毁许多战争工具，歼灭敌军大量有生力量。各地的游击战也有了新的发展。
    越南南方解放武装力量在战斗中迅速地成长壮大，特别是解放武装力量炮兵的不断壮大，使得美伪军和帮凶军更是怕得要死。解放武装力量在各个战场上赢得的巨大胜利，基本上挫败了美国侵略强盗的第二个“旱季反攻”计划，使它的“钳形攻势”在一开始就遭到了失败，从而为一九六七年全年取得更大的胜利奠定了良好的基础。
    越南南方解放武装力量指挥部在这项公报中指出，美国侵略者已经遭到了惨重的损失，但是它并没有放弃狂妄的侵略野心。公报号召越南南方解放武装力量和人民再接再厉，继续英勇奋战，同时提高警惕，挫败敌人的一切新阴谋，使敌人的新的侵略计划遭到彻底失败。
