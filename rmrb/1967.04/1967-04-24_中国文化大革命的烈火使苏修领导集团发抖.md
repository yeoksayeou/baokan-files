The Soviet revisionist leadership's frenzied attacks and malicious slanders against our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have aroused the utmost indignation of the revolutionary masses throughout China. Revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers in Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City have held meetings and discussions or spoken to reporters from this newspaper, firmly refuting the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China fabrications.

They unanimously believe that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary movement personally initiated and led by our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao. This revolution has armed the people of the entire country with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, exposed the capitalist-roaders of all sizes within the Party, smashed the "four olds" of the exploiting classes, uprooted the roots of revisionism, and thoroughly smashed the plots of imperialism and modern revisionism to restore capitalism in our country. For this reason, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, has launched increasingly frenzied attacks and slanders against our Cultural Revolution.

The Soviet revisionists have degenerated to the point of relying on slander to sustain themselves.

Workers, officials, and students from factories, offices, and schools in Harbin said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." This is the most sharp weapon for us, the revolutionary proletariat, to distinguish right from wrong, grasp the direction, and stand firm in the stormy class struggles at home and abroad. Since last summer, the Soviet revisionist leadership has mobilized its entire propaganda machine and dispatched big and small leaders to launch an anti-China wave, "gradually escalating" their attacks on our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This precisely shows that our Cultural Revolution has made these traitors of the proletarian revolution tremble with fear and suffered heavy blows.

Red Guards from Harbin Normal University and Medical University said: We, the revolutionary proletariat of China, have never done anything to please the Soviet masters. The more they oppose us, the more we will do it. We will resolutely smash imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, sound their death knell, and sweep them into the dustbin of history with the broom of revolution. The Red Guards pointed out that in the sharp and intense power seizure struggles in Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City, the counter-revolutionary organizations "Red Flag Army" and "Preparedness Army" are the sworn enemies of the revolutionary proletariat. The Soviet revisionist leadership is like the international "Red Flag Army" and "Preparedness Army." They are the henchmen of U.S. imperialism, the vanguards of suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and the common enemy of the revolutionary people of the world. Red Guards from Harbin Institute of Military Engineering angrily said: The Soviet leaders slander us Red Guards as "acting recklessly," "destroying culture," "attacking cadres," and "disrupting freedom." This proves that they have degenerated to the point of relying on slander to sustain themselves.

The Soviet revisionists will never be able to disrupt the unity between our military and civilians.

PLA soldiers who firmly support the revolutionary proletariat in the power seizure struggles are particularly indignant about the Soviet revisionist leadership's vicious attacks on our People's Liberation Army.

Comrades Qu Shiren and Zhou Deming from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Military Region said: Chairman Mao teaches us to "stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we enthusiastically responded to the call of our great commander Chairman Mao, resolutely carried out the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and became the steadfast defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary organizations, causing the reactionary forces to crumble, and making the broad revolutionary masses proud. The Soviet revisionist leadership's accusation that we are "implementing violence and suppression" only proves that they are in cahoots with the counter-revolutionary forces in our country that have been suppressed.

Comrades Zhang Guozhong and Chen Jinlong from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Military Region said: The Soviet revisionist leadership's curses and slanders against our army do not diminish the great glory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, but rather prove that we are a glorious people's army. We will forever fight side by side with the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the world to fight to the end to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries!

Recently, revolutionary workers participating in the conference on revolution and production on the industrial and transportation front in Heilongjiang Province have refuted the Soviet revisionist leadership's instigations and slanders against our workers, peasants, and the PLA with their personal experiences. Whether they are from the distant forest area of Yichun or the agricultural reclamation soldiers of Beidahuang, or revolutionary workers from various factories and enterprises in the suburbs of Harbin, they all pointed out unanimously: The fighting unity between us, the revolutionary proletariat, and the PLA was established under the call of our great leader Chairman Mao in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power seizure struggle. It has undergone severe tests of class struggle and is unshakable and indestructible by anyone. The Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to sow discord between us revolutionary workers and the revolutionary army, and even to incite revolutionary masses to direct their struggle against the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, is laughable and self-delusional, a sheer fantasy.

Grasp the revolution, promote production, and strike back at the Soviet revisionists.

High Xingsui, a fitter from the Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory, said: After our factory's revolutionary proletariat won the power seizure, we repelled the evil wind of counter-revolutionary economism, rectified the production order, and made production rise month by month, with a very good situation! The entire factory completed the annual production plan 18 days ahead of schedule last year, exceeding the quantity and ensuring the quality. After the broad revolutionary workers took charge, production enthusiasm soared. The entire factory completed the production tasks for April in mid-March. Now we are striving to complete the entire year's production tasks one quarter ahead of schedule.

Wang Mingshu, a Red Guard from the Harbin Tractor Parts Factory, also proved with the factory's daily rising production that the Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for production development, and production development is a necessary result of the Cultural Revolution. He said that this situation most powerfully proves the great victory of Chairman Mao's call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," giving the Soviet revisionist leadership a resounding slap in the face.

We will never allow the Soviet revisionists to interfere in our internal affairs.

Atu Zhiyao, a revolutionary leading cadre from the Harbin Bicycle Factory, refuted the Soviet revisionists' vile slanders on the cadre issue with his personal experience. He said: "The Soviet revisionists slander our Cultural Revolution as 'attacking cadres,' which is sheer nonsense. I am an old cadre with 29 years of party membership. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses not only did not knock me down but also warmly welcomed me to stand up and fight and make revolution with them. We want to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all revisionist elements who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. The Soviet revisionist leadership's public expression of 'deep sympathy' for China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, and even their arrogant claim to 'influence' the 'situation in China,' isn't this precisely exposing their evil plot to interfere in China's internal affairs and rely on these revisionist elements to achieve capitalist restoration?"

Red Guards from Heilongjiang University also said: We Red Guards hate the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and resolutely want to expose and overthrow him, while we have always loved and supported revolutionary leading cadres and will continue to do so. Those who push the reactionary line of "attacking a large number and protecting a small number" on the cadre issue are precisely the number one capitalist-roader within the Party.

The banner of Marxism-Leninism will surely fly high again in the Soviet Union.

Participants in the discussion unanimously pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's frenzied attacks on our Cultural Revolution are not only intended to encourage a small handful of revisionist elements in our country but also to fear that the fiery Cultural Revolution in China will spread to their doorstep, arousing the Soviet people to rise up and overthrow their revisionist rule. But this is in vain. The days of the Soviet ruling clique are numbered. The Soviet people will one day awaken, unite, and overthrow them. The banner of Marxism-Leninism will surely fly high again over the land of the October Revolution.

Currently, the revolution and production in Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City are presenting a very good situation. The revolutionary proletariat and PLA soldiers in the entire province, together with the people of the whole country, are launching a general offensive against the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. They are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, seize greater victories in revolution and production. They unanimously expressed that the anti-China wave launched by the Soviet revisionist leadership will never be able to stop the victorious march of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but will only further arouse the indignation of our people in opposing modern revisionism. "The golden monkey wields a thousand-catty cudgel, and the jade sky is clear for ten thousand miles." In the face of the rolling wheels of history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Soviet revisionist leadership will suffer nothing but heavier blows and more shameful failures.

    黑龙江省和哈尔滨市无产阶级革命派怒斥苏修掀起新的反华浪潮
    中国文化大革命的烈火使苏修领导集团发抖
    苏修公然支持中国的赫鲁晓夫，妄想中国复辟资本主义，这是白日作梦
    本报讯　苏修领导集团对我国无产阶级文化大革命的猖狂攻击和恶毒诬蔑，激起了我国广大革命群众的无比愤怒。黑龙江省和哈尔滨市的无产阶级革命派和解放军指战员们，纷纷举行集会座谈或向本报记者发表谈话，坚决驳斥苏修领导集团的反华谰言。
    他们一致认为，我国无产阶级文化大革命，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的一场史无前例的伟大革命运动。这场革命用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了全国广大人民，揪出了党内大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派，大破剥削阶级的四旧，挖掉修正主义的根子，彻底粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义妄想在我国实现资本主义复辟的阴谋。正因如此，苏修领导集团才同美帝国主义一唱一和，对我国文化大革命进行越来越疯狂的攻击和诬蔑。
    苏修已堕落到靠造谣诽谤过日子
    哈尔滨市工厂、机关、学校的红色造反团战士们说：毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”这是我们无产阶级革命派在国内外阶级斗争的大风大浪中明辨是非，掌握方向，站稳立场的最锐利的武器。苏修领导集团从去年夏天以来，开动整个宣传机器，出动大小头目，掀起反华浪潮，“逐步升级”地反对我国无产阶级文化大革命，正好说明我们文化大革命的烈火，使这些无产阶级革命的叛徒吓得发抖，受到了沉重打击。
    哈尔滨师范学院和医科大学的红卫兵们说：我们中国无产阶级革命派做的事情，从来也没有想让苏修老爷们高兴过。苏修越是反对我们，我们就越要这样做。我们就是要大造帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反，要敲响他们的丧钟，要用革命的铁扫帚把他们扫进历史的垃圾堆。红卫兵们指出，在黑龙江省和哈尔滨市尖锐激烈的夺权斗争中，反革命组织“红旗军”、“战备军”是无产阶级革命派的死对头，而苏修领导集团就好比国际上的“红旗军”、“战备军”，他们是美帝国主义的帮凶，是镇压各国人民革命斗争的急先锋，是全世界革命人民的公敌。哈尔滨军事工程学院的红卫兵们气愤地说：苏修头目颠倒黑白地诬蔑我们红卫兵“胡作非为”，“毁灭文化”，“打击干部”，“破坏自由”，这证明他们已经堕落到只能靠造谣诽谤来过日子了。
    苏修休想破坏我国军民团结
    在夺权斗争中坚决支持无产阶级革命派的解放军指战员们，对于苏修领导集团对我人民解放军的恶毒攻击，感到特别愤慨。
    黑龙江省军区某部五好战士曲世荣和周德明说：毛主席教导我们要“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们最热烈地响应伟大统帅毛主席的号召，最坚决地执行支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的任务，成为无产阶级文化大革命的坚强保卫者。我们坚决镇压反革命组织，使反动势力的队伍土崩瓦解，使广大革命群众扬眉吐气。苏修领导集团攻击我们“实行暴力和镇压”，这只能证明他们同我国被镇压的反革命势力是一丘之貉。
    黑龙江省军区某部张国忠、陈金龙说：苏修领导集团对我军的咒骂和诬蔑，丝毫无损于毛主席亲自缔造的中国人民解放军的伟大光辉，反而证明了我们是一支光荣的人民军队。我们要永远同全国人民和全世界革命人民并肩战斗，为打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派而斗争到底！
    最近参加黑龙江省工交战线抓革命促生产工作会议的革命职工们，纷纷以亲身感受坚决驳斥了苏修领导集团对我工农群众和解放军进行的挑拨诬蔑，而且以有力的事实粉碎了他们所捏造的对我国经济状况的诽谤和谎言。无论是来自遥远的伊春林区的红色造反者和北大荒的农垦战士，或是哈尔滨郊区各工厂企业的革命职工们，都一致指出：我们无产阶级革命派同解放军的战斗团结，是在伟大领袖毛主席的号召下，在革命的“三结合”的夺权斗争中建立起来的，是经历过阶级斗争的严重考验的，是任何人也动摇不了，破坏不了的。苏修领导集团企图挑拨我们革命职工同革命军队之间的关系，甚至阴谋煽动革命群众把斗争矛头转向光荣的中国人民解放军，这是可笑不自量，是十足的痴心妄想。
    狠抓革命，猛促生产，打击苏修
    哈尔滨石油机械配件厂钳工高星遂说：我厂的无产阶级革命派在夺权胜利以后，打退了反革命经济主义的妖风，整顿了生产秩序，使得生产月月上升，形势好得很！全厂在去年提前十八天完成了全年生产计划，既超过了数量，又保证了质量。广大革命职工当家作主以后，生产情绪大为高涨。全厂在三月中旬就完成了四月份生产任务。现在正在努力争取全年生产任务提前一个季度全部完成。
    哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂红色造反者王明述也以本厂生产日日上升的事实证明文化大革命是生产发展的强大动力，生产发展是文化大革命的必然结果。他说，这种情况，最有力地证明了毛主席号召的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大胜利，给了苏修领导集团一记响亮的耳光。
    决不允许苏修干涉我国内政
    哈尔滨自行车厂革命领导干部于志远以亲身的体验有力地驳斥了苏修在干部问题上的卑劣诽谤。他说：“苏修诬蔑我们文化大革命要‘打击干部’，这完全是胡说八道。我是一个已有二十九年党龄的老干部。在文化大革命中，革命群众不但没有把我打倒，而且热烈地欢迎我站出来同他们一起战斗，一起革命。我们要打倒的是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的修正主义分子。苏修领导集团对于中国的赫鲁晓夫及其伙伴公然说‘深表同情’，甚至狂妄地叫嚷要对‘中国局势’施加‘影响’，不是恰恰暴露出他们干涉中国内政，妄想依靠这些修正主义分子来实现资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋吗？”
    黑龙江大学的红卫兵们也说：我们红卫兵对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派疾恶如仇，坚决要把他批臭斗倒，而对革命的领导干部，过去我们热爱支持，今天仍然热爱支持。在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这条资产阶级反动路线的，恰恰是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。
    马列主义旗帜必将在苏联重新飘扬
    参加座谈会的人一致指出，苏修领导集团所以要大叫大嚷地反对我国文化大革命，这不但是企图给我国的一小撮修正主义分子打气，而且害怕中国文化大革命的烈火烧到他们的脚下，激起苏联人民起来造他们的反，掀翻他们修正主义的统治。但这是徒然的。苏修统治集团的日子长不了。苏联人民总有一天要觉醒起来，团结起来，打倒他们。马克思列宁主义的旗帜一定会重新高高地飘扬在十月革命故乡的大地上。
    目前，黑龙江省和哈尔滨市的革命和生产正呈现出一派大好形势。全省的无产阶级革命派和解放军指战员们同全国人民一起，正在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击。他们决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。他们一致表示，苏修领导集团掀起的反华浪潮绝对阻挡不了我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进军，而只能更加激发我国人民反对现代修正主义的斗志。“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在中国无产阶级文化大革命滚滚向前的历史车轮面前，苏修领导集团除了遭到更加沉重的打击，更加可耻的失败之外，是决不会有什么别的下场的。
