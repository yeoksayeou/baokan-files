The Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the West Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation to China signed a joint statement in Beijing today. The joint statement enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao as the greatest teacher of our time, asserting that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The radiant light of great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to liberation for the people of all countries.

The joint statement commends the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, as the broadest, deepest, and largest-scale revolutionary mass movement in human history. The profound impact of this great revolution has transcended national boundaries, inspiring the people of the world.

The joint statement points out that the U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, Japanese reactionaries, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists are all of a kind, being the vicious enemies obstructing and sabotaging the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. To develop Sino-Japanese friendship and trade relations, it is necessary to oppose all their obstructive and sabotaging activities.

During their stay in China, the West Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation to China held friendly talks with the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade on the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, especially on the development of friendship and trade between China and the West Japan region. They reached a consensus on these issues.

The joint statement states that the West Japan Friendship Trade Delegation to China, through extensive visits and observations, has come to understand that:

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a great revolutionary movement to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to seize power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. This is a great revolutionary movement to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and prevent socialist countries from changing color.

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a comprehensive class struggle, in which the broad masses, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, use the forms of great debate, big-character posters, great criticism, and great linking up to carry out a great democracy. This great democracy is a manifestation of the extremely solid nature of the Chinese proletarian dictatorship.

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that launches a total attack on bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies, a revolution that touches the souls of people. The broad revolutionary masses, holding high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the old ideas of the exploitative classes and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. Seven hundred million people are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Throughout China, a new era has emerged where the broad masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade Lin Biao said, 'Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power.'"

The joint statement states, "The various rumors spread by U.S. imperialism, the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, Japanese reactionaries, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are all malicious slander and shameless defamation." "The Chinese people, armed with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and achieve complete and thorough victory."

When discussing the current favorable situation of anti-imperialism among the people of various countries, the statement strongly condemns the Sato government of Japan for following the U.S. imperialists, pursuing economic militarization, actively reviving militarism, and serving as a vanguard for the U.S. in "containing" China. The statement says that the Japanese people must resolutely fight against the Japanese and American reactionaries to the end.

The joint statement points out that the shameful activities of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists in sabotaging Sino-Japanese friendship "further expose their nature of serving the U.S., Japanese reactionaries, and the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Japanese Communist Party revisionists have become enemies of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade and must be fought against head-on."

The joint statement states that both sides pointed out that the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade is the common wish of the 800 million people of the two countries and an irresistible historical trend. Chairman Mao said: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capitalists and militarist warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." He also said: "The peoples of China and Japan should unite." Let us, under the guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought, strive to push the movement of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade to an even broader scope.

The West Japan Friendship Trade Delegation to China expressed in the joint statement that they will actively carry out propaganda activities in Japan to widely and correctly introduce China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; insist on the three political principles, three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations; strive to smash the Japanese government's policy of following the U.S. in opposing China, further develop Sino-Japanese friendly trade, and work for the early restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Before the signing of the joint statement, Chinese and Japanese friends together studied Chairman Mao's quotations. After the signing, everyone sang "The East Is Red" in unison.

Those who signed the joint statement include Vice Chairman Hou Tong of the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade and other representatives of this council; Team Leader Fujisawa Kazuo, Deputy Team Leader Motoyama Masanori, and members of the West Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation to China.

Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, and Jia Shi, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, attended the signing ceremony. Also present at the signing ceremony were Japanese friends in Beijing, such as Nishizono Koichi.

After the signing, the West Japan Friendship Trade Delegation to China held a reception to celebrate the signing of the joint statement.

    毛泽东思想是战胜帝修反的强大武器
    文化大革命是最深刻的革命群众运动
    美帝苏修日本反动派和日共修正主义分子是中日两国人民的敌人
    新华社十一日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和西日本国际贸易促进会友好贸易访华代表团，今天在北京签署了一项共同声明。共同声明热烈称颂毛主席是当代最伟大的导师，毛泽东思想是各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大的思想武器，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了各国人民的解放道路。
    共同声明赞扬说，伟大的毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上最广泛、最深刻、规模最大的革命群众运动，这场大革命的深远影响，已经超出一国范围，鼓舞着全世界人民。
    共同声明指出，美帝、苏修、日本反动派和日共修正主义分子都是一丘之貉，是阻挠和破坏中日人民友好的凶恶敌人。为了发展中日友好和贸易关系，就必须反对他们的一切阻挠和破坏活动。
    西日本国际贸易促进会友好贸易访华代表团在中国期间，同中国国际贸易促进委员会，就发展中日友好和贸易、特别是发展中国同西日本地区间的友好和贸易问题，进行了友好的会谈，取得了一致的意见。
    共同声明说，西日本友好贸易访华代表团通过广泛的参观和访问体会到：
    “伟大的毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要亿万人民动员起来，夺取党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。这是一场巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，防止社会主义国家改变颜色的伟大革命运动。
    “无产阶级文化大革命，是一场全面的阶级斗争，是广大群众在毛主席革命路线的指引下，运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的大民主形式来进行的。这种大民主，是中国无产阶级政权非常巩固的表现。
    “无产阶级文化大革命，是对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发起总攻击的大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。广大革命群众高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，大破剥削阶级的旧思想，大立毛泽东思想。七亿人民活学活用毛主席著作。整个中国，出现了一个广大群众掌握毛泽东思想的新时代。正如林彪副主席所说的，‘毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。’”
    共同声明说，“美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义领导集团、日本反动派和日共修正主义分子对中国无产阶级文化大革命的种种谣传，都是恶意中伤和无耻诽谤。”“用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，必将把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，取得全面和彻底的胜利。”
    共同声明谈到当前各国人民反帝的大好形势时，强烈谴责日本佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，进行经济军事化，加紧复活军国主义，积极充当美国“遏制”中国的马前卒。声明说，日本人民要坚决同日美反动派斗争到底。
    共同声明指出，日共修正主义分子破坏中日友好的可耻活动“进一步暴露了他们为美、日反动派和苏修领导集团效劳的本性。日共修正主义分子已经成了中日友好和贸易的敌人，必须同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。”
    共同声明说，双方指出，发展中日友好和贸易，是两国八亿人民的共同愿望，是不可抗拒的历史潮流。毛主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”又说：“中日两国人民要联合起来”。让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，努力奋斗，把中日友好和贸易运动向更加广阔的方面推进。
    西日本友好贸易访华代表团在共同声明中表示：要在日本国内积极开展宣传活动，广泛地正确地介绍中国的无产阶级文化大革命；要坚持中日关系的政治三原则、贸易三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则；为粉碎日本政府追随美国敌视中国的政策，进一步发展中日友好贸易，早日恢复中日邦交而努力。
    在共同声明签字以前，中日两国朋友一起学习毛主席语录，签字以后，大家齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    在共同声明上签字的有，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主任侯桐以及这个委员会的其他代表；西日本国际贸易促进会友好贸易访华代表团团长藤泽一雄、副团长本山正则以及代表团的成员。
    中日友协会长廖承志，对外贸易部副部长贾石等出席了签字仪式。出席签字仪式的，还有在北京的日本朋友西园寺公一等。
    签字以后，西日本友好贸易访华代表团举行招待会，祝贺共同声明的签字。
