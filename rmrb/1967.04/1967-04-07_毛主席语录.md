	Quotations from Chairman Mao

	The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last-ditch efforts. Even after the country has been pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to stage a comeback in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance. 	_From the Opening Speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference_

    毛主席语录
    帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。　《在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词》
