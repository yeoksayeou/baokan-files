The United States is trying to play a trick by using the so-called "independence" of South Vietnam to deceive the world public opinion. The truth is that the United States is the real master of South Vietnam. It is the United States that controls the political, economic, and military affairs of South Vietnam. The United States has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops in South Vietnam and has been waging a war of aggression against North Vietnam. The United States has also been interfering in the internal affairs of South Vietnam, supporting the reactionary regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and suppressing the people's revolutionary movement.

The United States claims that it is supporting the "independence" of South Vietnam. In fact, it is using the pretext of "independence" to continue its aggression and interference in South Vietnam. The United States is trying to create a puppet regime in South Vietnam that will serve its interests. The United States is also trying to divide the Vietnamese people and prevent them from achieving national reunification.

The people of South Vietnam and the people of the world will not be deceived by the United States' tricks. The people of South Vietnam are struggling for national independence and reunification. They will not allow the United States to interfere in their internal affairs and to continue its aggression. The people of the world are supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people for national independence and reunification. They will not allow the United States to continue its aggression and interference in Vietnam.

The United States must withdraw its troops from South Vietnam and stop its aggression and interference. The people of South Vietnam have the right to determine their own future and to achieve national reunification. The United States must respect the independence and sovereignty of South Vietnam and the right of the Vietnamese people to self-determination. The people of the world must support the struggle of the Vietnamese people for national independence and reunification and oppose the United States' aggression and interference in Vietnam.
