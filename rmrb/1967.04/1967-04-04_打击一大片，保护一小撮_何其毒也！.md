After reading the commentary by the editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine titled "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized," we felt particularly close and excited. This article expresses the sentiments of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff.

When the Cultural Revolution began, Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School was a typical case in the secondary education sector, personally overseen by someone who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line. Just like Tsinghua University, our school implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large group, protecting a few" in cadre issues.

The proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line feared the broad revolutionary masses, the broad revolutionary cadres, and especially feared the combination of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres forming a mighty revolutionary torrent to sweep away their positions. Thus, they suppressed the masses and adopted the tactic of "striking a large group" against the cadres, confusing two types of contradictions, shifting the target of struggle, and protecting their small clique.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally formulated the Twenty-three Articles, which point out that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good; efforts should be made to unite more than 95 percent of the cadres; the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented for cadres who make mistakes; the focus should be on striking down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, under the personal manipulation of someone who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, the work team completely went against these wise instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. As soon as they entered the school, within less than ten hours, they declared that they would definitely expose the "Three-Family Village" in our school, and then labeled nearly 90 percent of the cadres as "black gang members." They turned a struggle that should have been between the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road into a struggle between the broad revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands, even millions of people, and mobilize a surging revolutionary force. This is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." However, those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line did the opposite. They launched a frenzied attack and persecution against the broad revolutionary cadres. They distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, and subjected revolutionary cadres to severe interrogation, forcing them to confess. They insisted on forcing everyone to admit to being "conscious counter-revolutionaries." Those who were labeled as "black gang members" were under strict surveillance by the work team, completely losing their personal freedom. They were either locked in rooms to write self-criticisms or supervised to do labor, and subjected to various forms of cruel physical punishment, completely depriving them of the right to participate in the Cultural Revolution. The top power-holder within the Party who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line and took the capitalist road is not only a fake revolutionary and counter-revolutionary himself but also does not allow others to revolutionize.

After the work team, under the direction of someone who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, labeled revolutionary cadres as "black gang members," they immediately carried out a so-called "removal of interference," labeling all party members and political teachers who had close ties with the original party branch as "big red figures of the black branch." They even regarded all teachers as enemies, personally instructing the work team to "strive to win over all or most teachers to rise up, even if they are fake, but they should not speak too much."

Why did they insist on persecuting revolutionary cadres? Someone who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line revealed the truth, saying: "Don't let the students have nothing to do, or they will cause trouble!" They were afraid that the revolutionary masses would "cause trouble" and rebel against them, so they used "striking a large group" to protect their "few," with such malicious intent!

The facts in our school fully prove that: "Not distinguishing between right and wrong, generally rejecting and generally overthrowing cadres, this is the proposal of those who advocated the bourgeois reactionary line, and this is how they did it." Anyone who tries to shift this responsibility to the revolutionary youngsters, to the revolutionary masses, or to the proletarian headquarters will absolutely not succeed. Now, the revolutionary cadres in our school have risen up in rebellion one after another. They are uniting with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to thoroughly criticize the top power-holder within the Party who took the capitalist road and his bourgeois reactionary line, and are determined to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”何其毒也！
    红代会北师大一附中　六·二○北京公社
    我们读了《红旗》杂志评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》之后，感到分外亲切和激动，这篇文章说出了我们革命师生员工的心里话。
    文化大革命刚开始的时候，我们北京师大一附中是提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人亲自掌握的中学方面的一个典型。我校跟清华大学一样，在干部问题上也是实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。
    资产阶级反动路线的提出者，害怕广大革命群众，害怕广大革命干部，特别害怕革命群众和革命干部结合起来，形成一股巨大的革命洪流，冲垮他们的宝座。于是，他们对群众进行镇压，对干部采取“打击一大片”的手段，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，转移斗争目标，以保护他们那一小撮。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的二十三条指出，大多数干部是好的和比较好的；要逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部；对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针；重点是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。但是，提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人亲自操纵下的工作组，完全违背伟大领袖毛主席的这些英明指示。他们一进校门，不到十个小时，就宣称一定要揪出我校大大小小的“三家村”，紧接着又把将近百分之九十的干部打成“黑帮分子”。他们把一场本来是广大革命群众和革命干部同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的斗争，变成了广大革命群众同革命干部之间的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”而提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人，却反其道而行之，对广大革命干部进行疯狂的打击、迫害。他们颠倒是非、混淆黑白，对革命干部大搞逼、供、信。一直要逼到个个都承认是“自觉反党”为止。那些被打成“黑帮分子”的革命干部，在工作组的严密监视之下，完全失去了人身自由，或关在房里写“检讨”，或被监督“劳动”，并遭受到各种各样残酷的体罚，完全剥夺了他们参加文化大革命的权利。提出资产阶级反动路线的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，他不仅自己是假革命、反革命，而且不许别人革命。
    提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人，在指使工作组把革命干部打成“黑帮分子”后，紧接着来了一个所谓“排除干扰”，把凡是与原党支部联系比较密切的党员、政治教师都定为“黑支部的大红人”。他们甚至把所有教师都看成是敌人，亲自指示工作组“要争取全部、多数老师起义，假的也好，但不许多说话。”
    为什么他们要死揪住革命干部不放呢？提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人，一语道破了天机，他说：“不要叫学生没事干，没事干就闹事！”他们就是怕革命群众“闹事”，“闹”到他们头上，造他们的反，就用“打击一大片”，来保护他们那“一小撮”，用心何其毒也！
    我们学校里的事实充分证明了：“对干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥、一概打倒，这是提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人的主张，他们就是这样干的。”任何人想把这个责任栽到革命小将身上，推到无产阶级革命派身上，推到无产阶级司令部身上，是绝对办不到的。现在，我们学校的革命干部已经纷纷起来造反了，他们正在与广大革命师生员工相结合，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他提出的资产阶级反动路线，誓死把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
