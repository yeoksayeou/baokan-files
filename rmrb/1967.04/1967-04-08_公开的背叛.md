The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in their dealings with the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, sometimes engage in false support and true betrayal; at other times, they openly betray, not even bothering with superficial support. Their stance towards the Palestinian people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, and their fight to return to their homeland, is of the latter kind.

At the fraudulent "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" convened illegally by the Soviet revisionists, the Soviet representative deliberately avoided discussing the essence of the Palestinian people's anti-imperialist struggle, dared not condemn the U.S. imperialists' aggression, and colluded with the Indian representative to obstruct the conference from adopting a resolution supporting the Palestinian people's just struggle. This once again exposed the Soviet revisionist clique's ugly face of betraying the interests of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries.

The Soviet representative defended their stance by claiming that they had not "studied" the Palestinian issue. This is sheer nonsense! The Palestinian issue is something you have "studied" very well. It is precisely because you have studied it so thoroughly that you consistently refuse to support the Palestinian people's struggle to return to their homeland at various international conferences. Your traitorous actions cannot be covered up with such a ridiculous excuse!

Israel is an aggressive tool created and backed by imperialism, a dagger inserted by the old and new colonialists into the Arab region, and a sworn enemy of the peoples of various Arab countries. Facing this savage enemy, armed by the weapons of U.S. and British imperialism, the Palestinian people have resolved to wage armed struggle to liberate their homeland. Their just struggle has won the support of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. However, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has always been in cahoots with Israel, acting in collusion. They have also collaborated with U.S. imperialism in playing the so-called "reconciliation" trick on the Palestinian issue, vigorously advocating the use of the "Tashkent spirit" to resolve the disputes between Israel and the Arab countries. This essentially means to deprive the Palestinian people of their sacred right to liberate their homeland, forcing them to lay down their arms, cease their struggle, acknowledge the status quo of Israel, and allow the U.S. imperialist claws to spread freely in the Middle East.

The Soviet revisionist clique, on the Palestinian issue, is completely playing the role of an accomplice to the U.S. and Israel. Therefore, to oppose the U.S. and its tool Israel, one must also oppose their accomplice, the Soviet revisionist clique.

    公开的背叛
    苏修叛徒集团对各国人民的革命斗争，有的时候是搞假支持、真出卖；有的时候则是公开背叛，连表面上的支持也不干。他们对于巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝工具以色列、争取重返家园的斗争，就是采取后一种做法。
    在苏修非法召开的亚非作家伪“三大”上，苏修的代表故意避而不谈巴勒斯坦人民反帝斗争的实质，不敢谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，并且伙同印度的代表竭力阻挠会议通过支持巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的决议。这就又一次暴露了苏修集团叛卖巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民利益的丑恶面目。
    苏修的代表辩解说，他们所以采取这种立场，是因为他们对巴勒斯坦问题“没有研究”。这完全是胡扯！对于巴勒斯坦问题，你们哪里是什么“没有研究”，你们正是因为很有“研究”，所以才在各种各样的国际会议上，一贯拒绝支持巴勒斯坦人民争取重返家园的斗争。你们的叛徒行径岂是用一句荒谬的遁词所能掩盖的！
    以色列是帝国主义一手制造和扶植的侵略工具，是新老殖民主义者插在阿拉伯地区的一把尖刀，是阿拉伯各国人民的死敌。面对着这个由美英帝国主义的武器装备起来的凶恶敌人，巴勒斯坦人民决心进行武装斗争，以解放自己的家园。他们的正义斗争，得到了亚非人民和全世界人民的支持。但是，苏修叛徒集团却一直同以色列勾勾搭搭，狼狈为奸。他们并且配合美帝国主义在巴勒斯坦问题上玩弄所谓“和解”的阴谋，大肆鼓吹用“塔什干精神”来解决以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的争端。这实质上就是要剥夺巴勒斯坦人民解放自己家园的神圣权利，强迫巴勒斯坦人民放下武器，停止斗争，承认以色列的现状，让美帝国主义的魔爪在中东任意伸展。
    苏修集团在巴勒斯坦问题上，完全是扮演着美帝和以色列的帮凶角色。因此，要反对美帝及其工具以色列，也就必须反对它们的帮凶苏修集团。
