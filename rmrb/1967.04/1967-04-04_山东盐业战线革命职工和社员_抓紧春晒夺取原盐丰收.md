Revolutionary workers and members on the Shandong salt industry frontline are seizing the spring sun to achieve a bumper harvest of salt. According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 30th: Revolutionary workers and members on the salt production frontline in Shandong Province have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They are not missing the opportunity to carry out spring sun production, determined to achieve a bumper harvest of salt this year.

Since last winter, the revolutionary faction on the salt production frontline in Shandong Province has united with the broad revolutionary workers and members, firmly defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They have smashed the repeated counterattacks by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the same time, they have resolutely implemented the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly holding their production posts, and have excellently completed the winter tasks of brine making and dike repair. By the end of February, the amount of third-grade brine prepared in the province was 7% more than the same period last year, and the dike repair work also achieved better results than in previous years. The successful completion of winter preparations has laid a solid material foundation for salt production this year.

After most of the salt fields in Shandong Province achieved revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and seized power, temporary power organs were established. Each salt field has set up and improved production command organizations. Revolutionary workers and members have overcome the difficulties caused by three consecutive rainstorms and snowfalls since the beginning of spring. They have started pond filling early, and by March 14th, the number of ponds filled has far exceeded the same period last year.

    抓紧春晒夺取原盐丰收
    据新华社济南三十日电  山东省原盐生产战线上的革命职工和社员，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，不失时机地进行春晒生产，决心夺取今年原盐生产的丰收。
    去年冬季以来，山东省盐业生产战线的革命派，团结广大革命职工、社员，坚定地保卫了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的多次反扑。他们同时坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，坚守生产岗位，出色地完成了冬季制卤、修滩等任务。到二月底，全省制备的三级卤水比去年同期多百分之七，修滩工作也取得了好于往年的成绩。冬季准备工作的胜利完成，给今年原盐生产打下了雄厚物质基础。
    山东省大部分盐场实现革命的“三结合”联合夺权后，成立了临时权力机构。各盐场都建立、健全了生产指挥机构。广大革命职工和社员战胜了入春以来连续三次雨雪所造成的困难，提早灌池生产，到三月十四日，灌池数已大大超过去年同期。
