Shanghai Food Company Revolutionary Faction Strengthens Political and Ideological Work to Gain Experience

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai, the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Food Company Liaison Station recently published an article in the *Wenhui Daily*, introducing how they strengthened political and ideological work among the masses and cadres during the power seizure struggle, implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, correctly handled cadre issues, and implemented the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The article said that the revolutionary faction and the workers of this company initially, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by those who advocated the complete rejection and overthrow of cadres, had incorrect understandings of revolutionary leading cadres. For a period, some revolutionary mass organizations in certain units dared not approach revolutionary cadres, advised cadres who had joined revolutionary mass organizations to withdraw, and dared not boldly let revolutionary cadres participate in the power seizure struggle. This disrupted the class line and hindered the smooth progress of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power seizure struggle.

The article said that in response to this situation, the revolutionary faction organization of this company followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "controlling ideological education is the key link in uniting the entire party for great political struggles," and firmly grasped the political and ideological work within the revolutionary faction and among the broad masses of workers, unifying the understanding of cadre issues, and resolutely resisting the infiltration of reactionary ideologies.

The article then introduced four specific methods they used to strengthen political and ideological work among the masses:

First, study documents. Organize the study of Chairman Mao's quotations and essays on cadre issues, and relevant editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine. Through study, everyone deeply understood Chairman Mao's teaching that "after the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor," further recognizing the important role of revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power seizure struggle.

Second, present facts. Everyone reviewed the facts of revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary faction fighting side by side, heart to heart, united in struggle, and victorious together in intense struggles, deeply feeling that revolutionary cadres are the party's precious asset, and only by implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can the power seizure struggle be victorious.

Third, visit the masses. A responsible person from the liaison station initially had incorrect understandings about how to handle cadres, believing that all cadres who made mistakes should be removed from their positions. Later, he visited several old workers with this question. The old workers unanimously said that cadres have good and bad, and cannot be treated the same. He sorted out the cadres in the factory with the old workers and found that most cadres were good or relatively good. This made him further realize that the cadre team is not uniform, and there are indeed two types of cadres with completely different natures, who cannot all be removed from their positions or overthrown.

Fourth, promote exchanges. Timely address the masses' active thoughts through various forms such as discussions, one-on-one talks, and cadre meetings, exchanging views on the current power seizure situation and opinions on cadre issues during the power seizure struggle.

The article discussed how to strengthen political and ideological work among cadres, saying that the key to whether cadres can stand up for the revolution lies in their own ability to break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and to put down their burdens. At the same time, practice has proven that as long as the revolutionary faction insists on implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and adopts the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," and the method of "unity-criticism-unity," more cadres can be united.

The article said that the main ideological reasons affecting cadres' participation in the revolution are threefold: first, insufficient understanding of the struggle between the two lines; second, unclear understanding of the revolutionary faction; third, putting "self" first, fearing this and that, and lacking the courage to stand up for the revolution. These ideological obstacles must be helped to be removed.

The article introduced the specific methods used by the revolutionary faction organization of this company to conduct political and ideological work among cadres:

First, comparative education. That is, conduct education on the two lines for cadres, arousing their deep hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line and their boundless love for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Second, class education. Through bitter and sweet class education, make cadres realize that they must first change their thoughts and feelings and standpoints, and then truly side with the revolutionary faction.

Third, self-education. Hold discussion meetings for cadres with similar thought types and cadre study experience exchange meetings, letting cadres educate themselves and liberate themselves.

Fourth, mass education. Specially arrange for three revolutionary pioneers to introduce to cadres their experiences of daring to revolution despite difficulties, which had the deepest and most profound impact on the broad cadres.

Through education for cadres, three problems were concentratedly solved, and three correct attitudes were established: first, solving the problem of understanding the struggle between the two lines, correctly handling the revolution; second, solving the problem of understanding the proletarian revolutionary faction, correctly handling the masses; third, solving the problem of breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, correctly handling oneself. In this way, it strongly promoted the broad cadres to jump out of "self," make up their minds, fear no sacrifice, put down their burdens, and resolutely stand up for the revolution, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary faction, and resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In this way, the revolutionary faction further united more revolutionary cadres, creating conditions for implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," for seizing power and holding power.

### 肃清资产阶级反动路线提出者把干部一概打倒的反动影响  坚决按毛主席的干部政策办事  上海食品公司革命派加强政治思想工作取得经验

    肃清资产阶级反动路线提出者把干部一概打倒的反动影响
    坚决按毛主席的干部政策办事
    上海食品公司革命派加强政治思想工作取得经验
    据新华社上海一日电  上海工人革命造反总司令部市食品公司联络站最近在《文汇报》上发表一篇文章，介绍了他们在夺权斗争中怎样加强群众和干部的政治思想工作，贯彻毛主席的干部政策，正确地对待干部，实行革命的“三结合”的经验。
    文章说，这个公司的革命派和职工群众，开始由于受到资产阶级反动路线提出者所主张的对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的影响，许多人对革命的领导干部的认识不正确。有一个时期，有些单位的革命群众组织不敢同革命干部接近，对已参加革命群众组织的干部劝他们退出，更不敢大胆地让革命干部参加夺权斗争。这样就扰乱了阶级阵线，阻碍了革命的“三结合”夺权斗争的顺利进行。
    文章说，针对这种情况，这个公司的革命派组织遵循毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，坚定不移地狠抓革命派内部和广大职工群众的政治思想工作，统一对干部问题的认识，坚决抵制了反动思潮的侵袭。
    文章接着介绍了他们在群众中加强政治思想工作的四种具体作法：
    首先是学文件。组织学习毛主席关于干部问题的语录、论述和《红旗》杂志的有关社论。通过学习，大家对毛主席关于“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”的教导，体会很深，进一步认识了革命干部在革命的“三结合”夺权斗争中的重要作用。
    二是摆事实。大家回顾了在激烈的斗争中，革命干部和革命派肩并肩，心连心，团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的事实，深深体会到革命干部是党的宝贵财富，只有实行革命的“三结合”，才能取得夺权斗争的胜利。
    三是访群众。联络站有位负责人，起初对怎样对待干部的问题有错误的认识，认为凡是犯错误的干部统统要罢他们的官。后来他带着这个问题去访问了好几个老工人。几个老工人异口同声地说，干部是有好坏，不能一律看待。他同老工人一起把厂里的干部排了排队，看到确实大多数干部是好的和比较好的。这使他进一步认识到干部队伍确实不是十个指头一般长，确实存在着两种性质完全不同的干部，不能统统罢官，一律打倒。
    四是抓交流。及时针对群众的活思想，采取座谈、个别谈心和召开骨干会议等多种形式，交流对当前夺权斗争形势的认识，以及在夺权斗争中对干部问题的看法。
    文章谈到怎样对干部加强政治思想工作时说，干部能否站起来革命的根本关键在于他们本身破私立公，放下包袱。同时实践也证明，只要革命派坚持贯彻毛主席的干部政策，实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，就能团结更多的干部。
    文章说，影响干部起来革命的思想原因主要有三点：一是对两条路线斗争的认识不足；二是对革命派的认识不清；三是“私”字当头，怕这怕那，没有勇气站起来革命。一定要帮助干部扫除这些思想障碍。
    文章介绍这个公司革命派组织对干部进行政治思想工作的具体作法是：
    一，对比教育。即对干部进行两条路线的对比教育，激起他们对资产阶级反动路线的无比痛恨，和对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱。
    二，阶级教育。通过忆苦思甜的阶级教育，使干部认识到只有首先从思想感情上、立场观点上转过来，才能真正倒向革命派一边。
    三，自我教育。召开思想类型相同的干部谈心会和干部学习心得交流会，让干部们自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    四，群众教育。专门安排三位革命闯将向干部介绍他们不怕困难，敢于革命的经过，这对广大干部教育最深，触动最大。
    通过对干部的教育，集中地解决了三个问题，树立了三个正确对待：一是解决对两条路线斗争的认识问题，正确对待革命；二是解决对无产阶级革命派的认识问题，正确对待群众；三是解决破私立公问题，正确对待自己。这样就有力地促使广大干部从“私”字中跳出来，下定决心，不怕牺牲，放下包袱，坚决站起来革命，坚决站在革命派一边，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。这样，革命派也就进一步团结了更多的革命干部，为实行革命的“三结合”，为夺权和掌权创造了条件。
