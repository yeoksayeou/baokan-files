We poor and lower-middle peasants have resolutely withstood this black wind.

Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Huang County, Shandong Province, and Secretary of the Party Branch of Xia Dingjia Production Brigade, Wang Yongxing

The article "Patriotism or Treason?" in the *Red Flag* magazine speaks for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is excellent. We poor and lower-middle peasants of Xia Dingjia have the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his throne." Together with the people of the whole country, we are rebelling against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and overthrowing this backstage manipulator of capitalist restoration in the countryside.

The "four freedoms" advocated by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party are, in essence, to rebel against socialism and to counterattack the poor and lower-middle peasants. The struggles that Xia Dingjia has experienced over the past seventeen years ultimately boil down to struggles against the "four freedoms" and the "three selfs and one contract," and also to struggles against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, who is the backstage manipulator of capitalist forces in the countryside.

The unified purchase and sale of grain marked the beginning of the struggle from the economic to the political. At that time, those who took the capitalist road in the countryside were very dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale. They complained here and there, but we poor and lower-middle peasants did not listen to them at all and resolutely withstood this reverse current. This was the prelude to the victory of the agricultural cooperativization struggle.

During the period of agricultural cooperativization, we shouldered the dual burden of achieving cooperativization and transforming the barren mountains and thin soil. However, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and his henchmen blew a black wind, saying that the scale was too large and that the cooperatives should be dismantled. To dismantle the cooperatives would be to give the green light to the "four freedoms" and to force the poor and lower-middle peasants to retrace their steps, allowing the landlords to exploit the peasants again and turning history backward. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely fought against them and insisted on taking the socialist road. We wielded our two iron arms, shovel by shovel, to build Xia Dingjia into a large-scale agricultural economy, greatly increasing grain production and economic income.

During the anti-rightist struggle, the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside, in collusion with the rightists in the cities, launched a fierce attack on us. They opposed collectivization and blew the wind of individual farming, saying that the steps were too big and that collective farming was not as free as individual farming. We stood up and debated with them, and once again, we refuted them.

After the establishment of the communes, they took advantage of the difficulties caused by three consecutive years of natural disasters in our country and again clamored for the "three selfs and one contract." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xia Dingjia, who held high the three red banners of the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the General Line, firmly grasped the key of class struggle, raised their awareness through reminiscences and comparisons, and repelled this counter-revolutionary reverse current.

In 1961 and 1962, the People's Communes achieved a great increase in agricultural production, and the poor and lower-middle peasants decided to sell more surplus grain to support national construction. However, the capitalist forces shouted loudly, saying that we were "trying to carry the banner" and "trying to be advanced." We again engaged in a great debate with them, and in the end, it was they who conceded. Later, they wanted to divide the large communes into small communes and turn the small communes into individual farms. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xia Dingjia, who had been tested by time, bravely fought back against the class enemies' counterattack and repelled their advances, and even exposed a handful of bad elements.

Over the past seventeen years, Xia Dingjia has developed in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, and between the two roads. In every major issue and at every historical turning point, we have not deviated from the struggle against the "four freedoms" and the "three selfs and one contract." Xia Dingjia has become a nationally advanced agricultural collective in the style of Dazhai, step by step. We know the sweetness of socialism, and we know even more the bitterness of capitalism. However, socialism did not fall from the sky, nor did it jump out of the ground. It is the result of our great leader Chairman Mao leading us to overcome countless difficulties and achieve one victory after another in class struggle. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, Xia Dingjia of today and yesterday has become two different worlds. The yield per mu of grain has increased from a few hundred jin before liberation to over a thousand jin; the public accumulation has reached nearly 400,000 yuan. If it were not for the socialist road, Xia Dingjia, with less than one mu of land per person, would have long become a beggar village.

Looking back at the past, today we must overthrow the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. We poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary peasants of Xia Dingjia are determined, together with the workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals of the whole country, to thoroughly overthrow the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, to knock him down and trample him to the ground, so that he will never be able to rise again!

    我们贫下中农坚决顶住了这股黑风
    山东省黄县革命委员会副主任、下丁家大队党总支书记　王永幸
    《红旗》杂志文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》是代表俺贫下中农说话的，好得很。我们下丁家贫下中农有着“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命精神，和全国人民一道，造这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反，打倒这个农村中复辟资本主义的总后台。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所提倡的“四大自由”，说到底，就是要造社会主义的反，要向贫下中农反攻倒算。下丁家十七年来所经历的斗争，归根结底就是和“四大自由”、“三自一包”的斗争，也是和农村中资本主义势力的总后台——党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。
    统购统销，就是这一从经济上到政治上斗争的开始。这时，农村中走资本主义道路的人很不满意统购统销政策，他们告到这，告到那，而我们贫下中农根本不听那一套，坚决顶住了这股逆流。这是取得农业合作化斗争胜利的前奏。
    农业合作化时期，我们一肩挑起了实现合作化和改变高山薄地两副重担。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他的走卒却大刮黑风，说摊子铺大了，要砍合作社。要砍合作社，就是为“四大自由”开放绿灯，就是硬逼贫下中农走回头路，让地主再重新剥削农民，让历史倒转。我们贫下中农坚决和他们进行了斗争，坚持走社会主义道路。我们挥动两支铁臂，一锨一锨地把下丁家建设成大农业经济，粮食产量大大提高，经济收入大大增加。
    反右派斗争中，农村中地富反坏分子在城市右派分子的配合下又向我们展开了猛烈的进攻。他们反对集体化，刮起单干风，说什么“步子走快了”，说什么“集体没有单干自由了”。我们站出来和他们辩论，又把他们辩倒了。
    公社化以后，他们又乘我国连续遇到三年自然灾害的困难时机，又嚷嚷要搞“三自一包”。高举大跃进、人民公社、总路线三面红旗的下丁家贫下中农，狠抓阶级斗争这条纲，通过回忆对比，提高了觉悟，打退了这股反革命的逆流。
    一九六一年和一九六二年人民公社取得了农业生产大增产，贫下中农决心多卖余粮支援国家建设。而资本主义势力却大叫大嚷，说我们是“想扛大旗”，“想当先进”。我们再次和他们开展了大辩论，最后，还是他们认输。后来他们又要把大社分成小社，把小社变为个体。久经考验的下丁家贫下中农，在阶级敌人反攻倒算面前，勇敢应战，击退了他们的进攻，并且把一小撮坏人揪了出来。
    十七年来，下丁家就是在这无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争中发展起来的。不管在那一个重大问题上，那一个历史关键时期，都没有离开和“四大自由”、“三自一包”的斗争。下丁家是一步一个脚印地变为大寨式全国农业先进集体的，我们知道社会主义的甜，我们更知道资本主义的苦。但是，社会主义不是天上掉下来的，也不是地里蹦出来的，而是我们伟大领袖毛主席领着我们越过重重困难，在阶级斗争中取得一个又一个胜利得来的。在毛主席的英明领导下，我们下丁家今昔相比，已成了两个世界。粮食亩产量已由解放前一二百斤，增长到一千多斤；公共积累已有近四十万元。要不是社会主义这条路，那每人平均不到一亩地的下丁家，早都成了要饭村了。
    回忆过去，今天我们非打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派不行。我们下丁家的贫下中农和革命农民，决心同全国工人、农民、解放军指战员和革命知识分子一道，彻底把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派斗倒斗臭，打翻在地，让他永世不得翻身！
