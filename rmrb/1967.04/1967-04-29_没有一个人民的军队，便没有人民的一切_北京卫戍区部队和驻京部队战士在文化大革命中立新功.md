The Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing have made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

“Without a People’s Army, there is nothing for the people.”

The Beijing Revolutionary Committee has been established! This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the skies!

In the days of celebrating victory, the millions of revolutionary masses in the capital enthusiastically shout: Learn from the heroic People’s Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the heroic People’s Liberation Army! They warmly praise the soldiers of the Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing, who have made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

“The Heavenly Troops March in June to Conquer Evil”

“In June, the heavenly troops march to conquer evil, with a thousand-foot rope to capture the rocs.”

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a magnificent and earth-shaking movement that has shaken the world. It began in the center of the world revolution!

The soldiers who have grown up under the sun and rain of Mao Zedong Thought are filled with excitement and their blood boils. They immediately threw themselves into this new great battle.

In this battle formation, there are heroic companies from the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan, who have achieved victory after victory in anti-“encirclement and suppression” campaigns under the command of Chairman Mao; there are sentinels who protected the Zunyi Conference on the Long March; there are soldiers who guarded the Yan’an caves with Zhang Zide throughout the night and followed Chairman Mao in the battles of Shaanbei; and there are troops who liberated Beijing with their brother units and guarded the first Five-Star Red Flag raised by Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square. These troops and the soldiers they have trained understand deeply from Chairman Mao’s long-term teachings: “All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power.” “All reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces.” With hearts filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, they solemnly vow before the great leader Mao Zedong: To protect our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to protect the socialist mountains and rivers for eternity, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire!

Du Zezhou, the deputy political commissar of a certain division, is one of the old soldiers of these troops. He joined the Red Army in 1933 and has been guarding Chairman Mao since 1937, from the foot of the Pagoda Mountain to the battlefields of Shaanbei, from the mountains of Ji to Beijing. Over the past thirty years, he has formed an unshakable belief: Our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, will always guide the revolutionary ship from victory to victory with his brilliant thoughts and wise revolutionary line. When the Cultural Revolution just began, he and his comrades devoted all their energy to protecting the Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary vanguards armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

This old soldier, who has experienced countless battles, is over fifty years old, but in this storm of class struggle, he is as energetic as a young soldier, riding his bicycle from east to west. He encourages the soldiers to create new achievements for the Cultural Revolution and tells them with his own experiences: “In the past, without the millions of revolutionary rebels led by Chairman Mao, we would not have overthrown the three great mountains on the heads of the Chinese people; today, without these millions of revolutionary vanguards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot ensure that our mountains and rivers will never change color!” One night, a clique of capitalist-roaders within a certain unit directed their puppet organizations to attack revolutionary leftist masses. Du Zezhou, with deep class feelings for the revolutionary masses, immediately rushed to the scene and fought side by side with the leftists in the open for two whole days and nights, greatly encouraging and strengthening the leftists. When his body could no longer hold out, the revolutionary masses repeatedly urged him to rest. But he returned to the office and could not rest easy. That same night, he returned to the ranks of the leftists and did not leave until victory was achieved.

In the capital, in the place where Chairman Mao resides, in the birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic soldiers, like Du Zezhou, are working day and night for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Batch after batch of revolutionary youngsters came from all over the country, and they enthusiastically arranged food and lodging for them, doing everything possible to protect the revolutionary activities of these youngsters; batch after batch of Red Guards went to various parts of the country to spread the revolutionary spark, and they arranged their itineraries and escorted them carefully. Since the Cultural Revolution, the capital has been in a new revolutionary order, with crowds of people on the streets, continuous processions, and big-character posters plastered all over the streets and alleys. The heroic soldiers have paid so much hard work to protect this revolutionary new order! In the scorching summer, the Red Guard youngsters went from schools to society, smashing the four olds of the exploiting classes, and the soldiers protected their safety by patrolling the streets under the scorching sun; in the cold winter nights, the revolutionary vanguards were linking up, debating, and posting big-character posters, and the soldiers stood guard far away from them in the bitter cold.

Last October, the Third Command of the Red Guards of the capital’s colleges and universities was still in the minority. To prevent its command organization from being attacked by reactionary organizations, a company of the troops guarding Tiananmen, although not tasked with guarding the Third Command, voluntarily patrolled and stood guard for them at night. One midnight, the sentry Dai Yonglu was patrolling around the Third Command’s residence when he suddenly saw dozens of fierce-looking people charging in. These people rushed into the Third Command’s rooms, smashed the glass of the doors and windows, and cut the phone lines. Dai Yonglu immediately reported the situation to the platoon leader and rushed back to the scene to protect the revolutionary youngsters. Platoon leader Yang Chengni led the soldiers to quickly rush to the scene and fought resolutely with the Third Command’s comrades against these people.

In this sharp and complex class struggle, a clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in society are making their last struggles, and they are restless at every opportunity. The soldiers’ slogan is: Only the leftists can rebel, the reactionaries cannot overturn the situation. At the beginning of the year, when the class enemies stirred up the counter-revolutionary economic wind, an organization called the “Red Flag Army,” controlled and manipulated by a few reactionaries, deceived some masses, committed crimes everywhere, damaged state property, persecuted revolutionary organizations, and attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers of a certain company’s Ninth Platoon, who were ready for battle, received orders and rushed to the scene. Together with their brother units, they launched a political offensive, quickly split and disintegrated this counter-revolutionary organization, awakened the deceived masses, and captured the ringleaders. The revolutionary faction fighting side by side with the soldiers proudly said: With Chairman Mao at the helm and the People’s Liberation Army as our strong rear, no matter how risky the waves are, we can advance bravely along Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line!

The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, created by Chairman Mao, is magnificent and surging under the protection of the heroic soldiers.

“A Million Heroes Cross the Yangtze”

“A storm rises over Mount Zhong, a million heroes cross the Yangtze.”

A thunderclap sounded, and the great “January Revolution” in Shanghai blew the horn for the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party!

At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a solemn call: The People’s Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses and support industrial and agricultural production.

The supreme commander gave the order, and thousands of troops moved swiftly. The heroic soldiers, holding the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” and carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, marched towards factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, suburban farms, and wherever the broad leftist masses needed support, in a grand procession!

In the Zhaoxindian Brigade of the Changxindian Commune, a fierce class struggle was taking place. Some cadres who had been removed during the Four Cleanups movement completely denied the great achievements of the Four Cleanups movement and illegally seized the power of the production brigade. At this time, a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team composed of Zhang Zhixiang, the deputy political commissar of a certain engineering regiment, and his comrades entered the village.

In the dark days when the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, Zhang Zhixiang suffered deeply. He was sold three times and changed his name. After liberation, to protect the socialist mountains and rivers won with blood, and to protect the red power established by Chairman Mao, he fought bravely against the U.S. aggressors on the Korean battlefield, and a piece of shrapnel from the class enemy is still in his body today. This old soldier, who deeply understands the importance of power, entered the village and immediately united closely with the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants, fighting side by side. In the fields and on the threshing grounds, he had heated discussions with the revolutionaries and patiently listened to the opinions of the old poor peasants. With deep class feelings, he encouraged the revolutionary vanguards to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works actively, and with the broad masses, he recalled bitterness and thought of sweetness, using Chairman Mao’s teachings to explain: Power must be in the hands of the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat, losing power means losing everything. The broad masses raised their consciousness and stood on the side of the revolutionaries, exposing the conspiracies of the class enemies and stripping off the masks of the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and seized back the leadership power they had usurped.

In the Huabei Metal Structure Factory, the revolutionaries did not have an absolute advantage, and the new revolutionary order was not well established. The phenomenon of the masses fighting each other, stirred up by a clique of capitalist-roaders within the factory, continued. A Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from a certain unit entered the factory. Who is the leftist, and who should be supported? The soldiers reminded each other: We must use Mao Zedong Thought to identify the leftists and support them, and we must not act on emotions. They remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings, went among the masses, and conducted thorough investigations and research. When they saw that some people who criticized them were indeed on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, they told these revolutionary comrades: Your criticism of us is indeed your trust in us. The broad revolutionary masses were deeply moved by the soldiers’ broad revolutionary minds. The revolutionary soldiers and the revolutionary masses were united heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder, deeply criticizing the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, educating the revolutionary masses, and awakening some deceived masses to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The leftist ranks were strengthened, the revolutionary organizations were consolidated, the temporary leadership of the revolutionary “three-in-one combination” was established, and the new revolutionary order was formed.

In this way, batch after batch of heroic soldiers appeared at critical moments in critical places. Their appearance greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses, stopping the counter-revolutionary economic wind; their appearance strongly supported the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat, smashing the tide of capitalist restoration; their appearance promoted the great alliance of the revolutionary vanguards, promoted the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” accelerated the struggle to seize power from the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party; their appearance greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of revisionism, making the revolutionary masses proud and the class enemies tremble with fear.

In the days of fighting side by side with the leftists, the heroic soldiers paid hard work. They thought what the leftists thought and worried about what the leftists worried about. The regimental chief of staff Ma Qingyuan, who led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to a certain automobile repair factory, worked and studied with the workers and always lived with the masses. When he fought side by side with the revolutionary masses, he always felt he had endless energy, sleeping only five or six hours a day without feeling tired, and forgetting to eat without feeling hungry. His comrades who worked with him also devoted themselves to the revolutionary masses. Deputy platoon leader Wang Qifa’s elderly relative was seriously ill, and the leadership wanted him to visit home, but he firmly refused; Deputy political instructor Shi Datong’s wife came from Henan to visit him, and he immediately persuaded her to return home, never leaving his glorious battlefield.

The heroic soldiers lived among the broad leftist masses. To achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary vanguards, they read Chairman Mao’s books with the revolutionary masses, opened the door for rectification, and broke private interests to establish public interests; to implement the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” they went to the dormitories of revolutionary workers and cadres at night, had long talks, sometimes talking to a cadre or a worker ten or twenty times. Many factories, schools, and rural people’s communes, after their painstaking and detailed political and ideological work, united the revolutionary vanguards, established the leadership of the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” and formed a new revolutionary order.

In this way, thousands of streams flow into the sea. Based on the great alliance of the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat in the capital, the representative conference of the Red Guards of colleges and universities was held, the conference of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants was held, the conference of representatives of revolutionary workers was held, and the representative conference of the Red Guards of middle schools was also held.

In the midst of the triumphant songs, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee was announced to be established, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital entered a new brilliant stage.

“It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with the remaining courage, and it is not advisable to seek fame and learn from the emperor.”

The capital is immersed in the joy of victory. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses, tempered by the stormy winds and rains, are full of confidence in building Beijing into a red fortress that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought when celebrating the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The soldiers guarding Chairman Mao, with the revolutionary spirit of “riding fast horses without dismounting,” are fighting a new battle for the revolutionary masses of the capital to advance towards a brilliant future and achieve great goals!

“Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress.” The heroic soldiers and the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launched a total attack on the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique he protected—the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee.

At the Beijing Iron and Steel Company, Pan Yongti, an old Red Army soldier who followed Chairman Mao in battles south and north for more than thirty years, and the soldiers he led, fought side by side with the revolutionary workers and cadres by the blast furnaces and in the workshops, setting up a battlefield to criticize and fight against the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. This is where the number one capitalist-roader within the Party carried out a series of counter-revolutionary activities. In July 1958, he echoed Khrushchev and gave four days of black “instructions,” viciously attacking our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, slandering the socialist system, advocating Yugoslavian “enterprise autonomy,” and promoting profit-seeking and material incentives, attempting to turn this socialist enterprise into a typical example of capitalist restoration. Is this tolerable? Who can tolerate it? The soldiers of Chairman Mao and the workers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought are filled with rage. They are determined to overthrow this Chinese Khrushchev and make him never rise again. At the denunciation meeting, people shouted in one voice: Completely overthrow the backstage manipulator of revisionism, let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly in every corner, and let the mountains and rivers won by Chairman Mao and the billion people never change color.

In the Li Su Commune of Shunyi County, the political instructor Lu Jinfu led a group of young soldiers. This is the “base point” of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. They carried out many evil deeds here: fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought, promoting material incentives, protecting the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and ruthlessly suppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the midst of the nationwide high tide of studying Chairman Mao’s works, Liao Stony, from the “Three Family Village” black shop, came here to force the masses to study the revisionist manifesto of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, “The Preface to the Frontline,” and to crazily oppose the poor and lower-middle peasants studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works actively, promoting capitalist restoration.

Lu Jinfu, born into a poor peasant family, grew up under the sun and rain of Chairman Mao. To protect the socialist mountains and rivers, fifteen years ago, he fought bravely on the Korean battlefield and won merits. The plot of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee to restore capitalism made him so angry that he could not eat or sleep well. As soon as he and his comrades entered the village, they fought day and night with the poor and lower-middle peasants. One noon, the commune was holding a meeting, and Lu Jinfu suddenly fell ill, feeling nauseous and vomiting. His comrades all advised him not to go. He said firmly: “On the battlefield, light injuries do not leave the front line. Today, at this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes and the fierce excavation of the black roots of revisionism, what is a little illness?” He endured the pain and went to the meeting to talk about the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and to criticize the heinous crimes of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee.

Seizing power is not easy, holding power is not easy, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat is even more difficult. The soldiers of Chairman Mao, in guiding the broad revolutionary masses to criticize the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique he protected, from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, spared no effort to help the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat hold and use power well. In the battle of destruction and construction, they vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary cadres and leaders of the revolutionary organizations, promoting the emphasis on politics, the four firsts, and the three-eighths style, helping them improve their ability to hold and use power, making them firmly grasp the handle of the proletariat.

After seizing power in the Wangzuo Commune, a revolutionary “three-in-one combination” leadership was formed. The regimental chief of staff Yang Xiaofeng, from more than twenty years of revolutionary practice, deeply understood that to hold and use power well, one must first have a very revolutionary leadership. In this commune, he spent several nights with the cadres, studying Chairman Mao’s great teachings: “Seizing national victory is only the first step of the ten-thousand-li Long March.” Together, they talked about the lessons of losing power and the importance of the handle under the lamp. At that time, work was chaotic, and a few new leaders were busy with daily affairs day and night. Yang Xiaofeng and they studied together Chairman Mao’s teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, making them realize that among thousands of things, mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the first big thing, inspiring them to take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works actively, and grasping the ideological revolution of the people. Soon, some masses reflected that some cadres spent more time in the commune and less time with the masses. This chief of staff again studied with them Chairman Mao’s teachings: “You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better.” And he led by example, mobilizing them to the front line to command the overall work, making them always live among the masses and maintain the style of the revolutionary vanguards.

Today, the broad revolutionary masses of the capital are full of vigor and high spirits, and under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, an unprecedented new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works has arisen, and the revolutionary great criticism and great struggle are surging forward. They are determined to build Beijing into a city of proletarian revolution that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and a strong fortress against imperialism and revisionism in the world.

The capital of our great motherland, the center of the world revolution, is like a rising red sun, shining brightly and illuminating the four directions. Under the guidance of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, Beijing is advancing, China is advancing, and the great proletarian revolution is advancing!

    没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切
    ——北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队战士在文化大革命中立新功
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    北京市革命委员会诞生了！这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东思想又一支响彻云霄的凯歌！
    在欢庆胜利的日子里，首都千百万革命群众纵情高呼：向英雄的解放军学习！向英雄的解放军致敬！热情地歌颂毛主席身边的战士——北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队广大指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出的伟大贡献。
    六月天兵征腐恶
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的气势磅礴、震撼全球的无产阶级文化大革命，在世界革命的中心开始了！
    长期在毛泽东思想阳光雨露滋润下成长起来的战士，心情无比激动，浑身热血沸腾，立即投入了这场新的伟大战斗。
    在这战斗的行列里，有来自革命摇篮井冈山，在毛主席统帅下，取得了一次又一次反“围剿”胜利的英雄连队；有在长征路上冲锋陷阵，保卫遵义会议的哨兵；有和张思德一起彻夜守卫延安窑洞，跟随毛主席转战陕北战场的战士；还有和兄弟部队一起解放北平，守卫毛主席在天安门广场上升起第一面五星红旗的部队。这些部队和这些部队培育出来的战士，从毛主席长期的谆谆教诲中，深深懂得：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。他们怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，在伟大领袖毛主席像前庄严宣誓：为了保卫我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为了保卫社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯！
    某师副政治委员杜泽州，就是这些部队中的一位老战士。他一九三三年参加工农红军，从一九三七年起，就守卫在毛主席身边，从宝塔山下到陕北战场，从冀西山区到首都北京，三十年来，他养成了一个不可动摇的信念：我们的伟大舵手毛主席永远会以他光辉的思想和英明的革命路线，把革命的航船从胜利引向胜利。当文化大革命刚刚兴起的时候，他就和他的战友们把全部精力投入到保卫文化大革命，保卫用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命闯将的工作中去。
    这位身经百战的老战士虽然五十多岁了，但是在这场阶级斗争的风雨里，他却象年轻的战士一样，骑着自行车东奔西跑。他勉励战士们为文化大革命创立新功，他用自己亲身的经历对战士们说：“过去，如果没有毛主席带领的那支千百万革命造反大军，就不会推翻中国人民头上的三座大山；今天，如果没有这亿万用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命闯将，就不能保证我们的江山永不变色！”
    一天夜间，有个单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指使其御用组织围斗革命左派群众。杜泽州怀着对革命群众的深厚阶级感情马上赶去，同左派群众在露天地里并肩战斗了整整两天两夜，给了左派群众很大鼓舞和力量。当他的身体实在支持不住的时候，革命群众一再劝他回去休息。可是，他回到机关怎么也放心不下，当天深夜又回到左派群众的行列里，直到取得了胜利才回去。
    在首都，在毛主席居住的地方，在无产阶级文化大革命的策源地，英雄的战士们象杜泽州一样，都在通宵达旦地为无产阶级文化大革命贡献着力量。一批批革命小将从祖国四面八方来了，他们热情地为小将们安排食宿，千方百计地保护小将们的革命串连活动；一队队红卫兵战士到祖国各地去传播革命火种，他们为这些小战士安排行程，认真护送。文化大革命以来的首都，一派革命的新秩序，街头人流滚滚，游行队伍络绎不绝，大字报贴遍大街小巷。英雄的战士们为保卫革命的新秩序，付出了多少辛劳啊！酷热的伏天，红卫兵小将从学校走向社会，大破剥削阶级的四旧，战士们为保护他们的安全，顶着烈日巡逻在街巷；严冬的深夜，革命闯将在串连，在辩论，在张贴大字报，战士们又冒着凛冽寒风，远远地为他们站岗放哨。
    去年十月，首都大专院校红卫兵第三司令部还处于少数的地位。为了使它的指挥机构不受到反动组织的攻击，守卫天安门的某部一连，虽然没有警卫三司的任务，但是战士们出于对毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚和对革命左派的深厚阶级感情，却主动在晚上为三司巡逻、站哨。一天午夜，哨兵戴永录正围着三司驻地巡逻，突然发现几十个气势汹汹的人冲来了。这些家伙一冲进三司的住房，就砸碎了门窗的玻璃，剪断了电话线。戴永录立即把情况报告给排长，并马上赶回现场，保卫革命小将。排长杨成妮带领战士迅速赶来，同三司的战友们一起，和这些家伙进行了坚决的斗争。
    在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，在作垂死挣扎，一有机会就蠢蠢欲动。革命战士的口号是：只准左派造反，不准反动派翻天。年初，当阶级敌人煽起反革命经济主义妖风的时候，一个名叫“红旗军”的反革命组织，在几个反动分子的控制和操纵下，蒙蔽了一些群众，到处为非作歹，破坏国家财产，迫害革命组织，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。严阵以待的某部九连的战士，接到命令，火速赶到现场，和兄弟部队一起，展开政治攻势，迫使这个反革命组织迅速分化瓦解，受蒙蔽的群众觉醒了，首恶分子俯首就擒。和战士并肩战斗的革命派自豪地说：有毛主席给我们掌舵，有解放军做我们的坚强后盾，任凭风险浪恶，我们都能沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进！
    伟大领袖毛主席创造的无产阶级专政下的大民主，在英雄的战士保卫下，波澜壮阔，汹涌澎湃。
    百万雄师过大江
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”
    霹雳一声，伟大的上海“一月革命”吹响了无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的进军号！
    在这关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出庄严的号召，人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众，支援工农业生产。
    最高统帅一声令下，千军万马雷厉风行。英雄的战士们举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，擎着毛主席画像，向厂矿企业，向机关学校，向京郊农村，向着左派广大群众最需要支持的地方，浩浩荡荡地出发了！
    在长辛店公社赵辛店大队，一场严酷的阶级斗争在激烈地进行。一些四清运动中下台的干部，全盘否定四清运动的伟大成果，非法抢夺了生产大队的大权。这时候，某部工兵营副政委张志祥和他的战友组成的毛泽东思想宣传队进村了。
    在国民党反动派掌权的黑暗日子里，张志祥苦大仇深，他三次被转卖，更名改姓。解放后，为了保卫用鲜血换来的社会主义江山，保卫毛主席亲手缔造的红色政权，他在朝鲜战场上，与美国侵略军英勇奋战，至今身上还留着一块阶级敌人的弹片。这位深深懂得政权重要的老战士，一进村就同无产阶级革命派和贫下中农紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起。在地头、场边，他和革命派热烈交谈，耐心地倾听老贫农的意见。他怀着深厚的阶级感情，鼓励革命闯将们活学活用毛主席著作，和广大群众一起忆苦思甜，用毛主席的教导说明：权，只能落在无产阶级革命派手里，丢了权就丢了一切。广大社员提高了觉悟，纷纷站到革命派一边，大揭阶级敌人的阴谋，大剥党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，夺回了被他们篡夺的领导权。
  在华北金属结构厂，革命派没有占绝对优势，革命的新秩序没有很好建立，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑起的群众斗群众的现象还在继续。某部毛泽东思想宣传队进厂了。谁是左派，该支持谁？战士们互相提醒，我们要用毛泽东思想识别左派，支持左派，绝对不可感情用事。他们牢记毛主席的教导，到群众中去，作周密的调查研究。当他们看清有些批评他们的人，确是站在毛主席革命路线一边的革命派的时候，就对这些革命战友们说：你们对我们的批评，正是对我们的信任。战士们宽阔的革命胸怀，使广大革命群众深受感动。革命战士和革命群众心连心，肩并肩，深入批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线，使革命群众受到了教育，一些受蒙蔽的群众也醒悟过来，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。左派队伍壮大了，革命组织巩固了，革命“三结合”的临时领导班子建立起来了，革命的新秩序形成了。
    就这样，一批批英雄的战士，在关键的时刻，出现在关键的地方。他们的出现，大大鼓舞了革命群众，煞住了反革命经济主义的妖风；他们的出现，有力地支持了无产阶级革命派，粉碎了资本主义复辟的逆流；他们的出现，促进了革命派的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”，加速了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争；他们的出现，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了修正主义的威风，使革命群众扬眉吐气，使阶级敌人胆战心惊。
    在和左派并肩战斗的日子里，英雄的战士们付出了辛劳。他们想左派所想，急左派所急。率领毛泽东思想宣传队到某汽车修配厂的团参谋长马清元，和工人一起劳动，一起学习，始终和群众生活在一起。他和革命群众并肩战斗的时候，总觉得有用不完的劲，每天睡五六个小时的觉不知道累，忘了吃饭不觉得饿。同他一起工作的战友也一心向着革命群众。副连长王启发的老人病重，领导上要他探家，他坚决拒绝；副政治指导员施大廷的爱人从河南来京探望，他立即动员她回乡去，自己始终未离开光荣的战斗岗位。
    英雄的战士就是这样生活在左派广大群众之中。为了实现革命派的大联合，他们和革命群众一起读毛主席的书，开门整风，破私立公；为了实行革命的“三结合”，他们又到革命职工、革命干部的宿舍，深夜长谈，有时同一个干部、一个工人谈十次、二十次。许多工厂、学校、农村人民公社，经过他们艰苦、细致的政治思想工作，革命派联合起来了，革命的“三结合”领导班子建立起来了。
    千支万流归大海，在首都无产阶级革命派大联合的基础上，大专院校红卫兵代表大会召开了，贫下中农代表会议召开了，革命职工代表会议召开了，中等学校红卫兵代表大会也召开了。
    在凯歌声中，北京市革命委员会宣告成立，首都无产阶级文化大革命跨进了新的光辉里程。
    宜将剩勇追穷寇
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”
    首都沉浸在战斗胜利的欢乐中。成千上万经过急风暴雨洗礼的革命群众，在欢庆北京市革命委员会诞生的时候，信心百倍地要把北京建设成永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红色堡垒。
    守卫在毛主席身边的战士们，以“快马加鞭未下鞍”的革命精神，为首都革命群众奔向光辉的前程，实现伟大的目标，又投入了新的战斗！
      “不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。英雄的战士和广大革命群众高举革命的批判大旗，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他包庇下的旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子发起了总攻击。
    在首都钢铁公司，跟随毛主席南征北战三十多年的老红军战士潘永堤和他率领的战士，同革命职工、革命干部一起在高炉旁，在车间里，摆下了狠批猛斗党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战场。这里，是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进行过一系列反革命活动的地方。一九五八年七月，他和赫鲁晓夫遥相呼应，连续作了四天黑“指示”，恶毒攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，诬蔑社会主义制度，鼓吹南斯拉夫的“企业自治”，宣扬利润挂帅、物质刺激，妄图把这个社会主义企业变成复辟资本主义的典型。是可忍，孰不可忍？毛主席身边的战士和毛泽东思想哺育的工人，怒火万丈，他们决心要把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，让他永世不得翻身。声讨会上，人们喊出一个声音：彻底打倒修正主义的总后台，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍每个角落，让毛主席统帅亿万人民打下的江山永不变色。
    在顺义县李遂公社，指导员鲁金福率领一批年轻战士来了。这里是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的“基点”。他们在这里搞了许多罪恶的勾当：大反毛泽东思想，大搞物质刺激，大力包庇地富反坏右，无情打击贫下中农。在全国轰轰烈烈的大学毛主席著作的高潮中，“三家村”黑店里的廖沫沙，到这里强迫群众学习旧北京市委的修正主义纲领《〈前线〉发刊词》，大讲“康梁变法”，疯狂反对贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，大搞资本主义复辟。
    贫农出身的鲁金福，是在毛主席的阳光雨露滋润下成长起来的。他为了保卫社会主义江山，十五年前，在朝鲜战场上英勇奋战，立下了战功。旧北京市委复辟资本主义的阴谋，使他气愤得吃不好，睡不安。他和战友们一进村，就和贫下中农日日夜夜战斗在一起。一天中午，公社要开会，鲁金福突然有病，恶心呕吐，战友们都劝他不要去。他斩钉截铁地说：“在战场上轻伤不下火线，今天在两个阶级决战、狠挖修正主义黑根的关键时刻，有点病算得什么？！”他忍着剧痛，到会大讲毛泽东思想的无比威力，大批旧北京市委的滔天罪行。
    夺权不容易，掌权也不容易，要巩固无产阶级专政更不容易。毛主席身边的战士，在引导广大革命群众，从政治上、思想上、理论上，全面批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他包庇的反革命修正主义集团的时候，竭尽全力帮助无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权。他们在大破大立的战斗中，向革命干部和革命组织的负责人大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传突出政治、四个第一、三八作风，帮助他们提高掌权、用权的本领，使他们牢牢地掌握无产阶级的印把子。
    王佐公社夺权后，组成了革命的“三结合”的领导班子。某团参谋长杨晓峰从二十多年的革命实践中深深懂得要掌好权、用好权，首先要有一个非常革命化的领导班子。在这个公社里，他一连几个晚上，和干部们一起学习毛主席的伟大教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”一起在灯下谈丢权的教训和印把子的重要。当时，工作千头万绪，几个新的领导成员一天到晚忙于日常事务。杨晓峰和他们共同学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，使他们认识到，千件事，万件事，掌握毛泽东思想是第一件大事，启发他们带头活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓人的思想革命化。不久，有的群众反映个别干部在公社时间多，和群众在一起时间少。这位参谋长又和他们一起学习毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”并言传身教，带动他们到第一线指挥全盘工作，使他们始终生活在群众之中，保持革命派的本色。
    今天，首都广大革命群众，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在北京市革命委员会的领导下，一个前所未有的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮兴起了，革命的大批判、大斗争的洪流滚滚向前。他们决心把北京建成永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级革命的城市，建成世界上反帝、反修的坚强堡垒。
    霞光万道，东风浩荡。我们伟大祖国的首都，世界革命的中心，犹如一轮初升的红日，光芒万丈，照耀四方。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，北京在前进，中国在前进，伟大的无产阶级革命在前进！
