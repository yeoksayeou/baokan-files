In the great criticism of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, it is crucial to actively support and enthusiastically help cadres to rise up in revolution. We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," and liberate a large number of cadres who have been struck down and deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a key issue in achieving the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary forces and promoting the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution. It is an extremely important battle task facing the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Twenty-three Articles," which point out: Most cadres are good or relatively good. The ten-month-long, magnificent proletarian cultural revolution mass movement has fully proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment. This correct assessment of the basic situation of cadres is universally applicable in all regions and units. We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly believe in this.

Currently, some comrades in certain units harbor doubts, lack confidence, and are dissatisfied with cadres who rise up in revolution. They even label cadres who come out as "speculators" without any analysis. This view of "doubting everything and overthrowing everything" is a reflection of anarchist thinking in our ranks. We should, like the proletarian revolutionaries in the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Shanghai Food Company, strictly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, "unite with the majority and strike down a small number." At the same time, we must be vigilant against and expose in a timely manner the fallacies spread by a small number of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as "beware of political opportunists," which attempt to obstruct cadres from rising up in revolution from the "left" and sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

There are also some comrades who adopt a passive attitude, waiting for cadres to rise up on their own. This attitude is equally incorrect. We must recognize that the majority of revolutionary cadres are victims of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." In their struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and a small number of revisionists, their goals are the same as those of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary forces must, with deep class feelings and wholehearted enthusiasm, help them and actively support them in coming out in the great criticism and in the struggle for power. For cadres who have made mistakes, we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." While seriously criticizing their mistakes, we must strengthen their ideological education to make them stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces. The experiences of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Shanghai Food Company have proven that, if we do this, we can quickly liberate a large number of cadres who have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line and maximize the isolation and attack on the small number of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Revolutionary cadres must bravely come out, break through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and free themselves from the spiritual shackles of the book "On Cultivation." They must fight back and join the revolutionary masses in the current mass movement to criticize the top capitalist-roader in the Party. In the new stage of the proletarian cultural revolution, they must build new achievements and establish new merits.

    在大批判中积极支持干部起来革命
    本报评论员
    在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，积极支持和热情帮助干部起来革命，彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，解放大批受资产阶级反动路线打击和蒙蔽的干部，这是实现无产阶级革命派大联合，促进革命的“三结合”的一个关键问题，是摆在无产阶级革命派面前一项极其重要的战斗任务。
    毛主席亲自主持制订的二十三条中指出：大多数干部是好的和比较好的。十个多月来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，完全证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。对干部基本情况的这一正确的估价，不论在各地区、各单位都是普遍适用的。我们无产阶级革命派一定要坚信这一点。
    现在，有一些单位的同志对起来革命的干部存在有“不相信，不放心，不称心”的看法，甚至干部刚起来亮相，就不加分析地说成是“搞投机”。这种对干部“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的观点，是无政府主义思潮在我们队伍中的一种反映。我们应该象山东省革命委员会和上海食品公司的无产阶级革命派一样，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，“团结大多数，打击一小撮”。同时，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所散布的“谨防政治扒手”等谬论，企图从“左”的方面阻挠干部起来革命，破坏革命的“三结合”的阴谋，应该提高警惕，及时戳穿。
    也还有一些同志抱着消极的态度，等着干部自己起来革命，这种态度同样是不正确的。必须认识到，广大的革命干部是“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的受害者，在与党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及一小撮修正主义分子的斗争中，他们和革命群众的斗争目标是一致的。因此，无产阶级革命派必须怀着深厚的阶级感情，满腔热忱地帮助他们，积极支持他们在革命的大批判中“亮相”，在夺权斗争中“亮相”。对于那些犯过错误的干部，一定要遵循毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的教导，在对他们的错误进行严肃批判的同时，加强思想教育，使他们站到毛主席的革命路线一边来，站到无产阶级革命派一边来。山东省革命委员会和上海食品公司的经验都证明，只要这样做，就能把大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害的干部迅速解放出来，最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    革命干部要勇敢地站出来，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍，挣脱《修养》那本书的精神枷锁，大杀回马枪，同革命群众战斗在一起，积极投身到当前批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动中来，在无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段中，建新功，立新劳。
