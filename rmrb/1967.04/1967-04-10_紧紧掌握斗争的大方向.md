The fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist and capitalist roads. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous and principal enemies. Concentrating forces to strike at this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the direction of the struggle that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must adhere to from beginning to end.

In supporting the struggle of the broad leftist masses, the People's Liberation Army is facing extremely sharp and intense class struggle, and the situation is complex. At present, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, unwilling to accept their defeat, are colluding with ghosts and monsters, gathering social dregs, using extremely treacherous and vicious means, desperately shifting the target of the struggle, and engaging in frenzied class revenge against the proletarian revolutionaries, stirring up a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, every cadre and soldier must firmly hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, stand closely with the broad leftist masses, and resolutely direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In considering and handling all matters, we must proceed from this direction and must submit to this direction. At any time and under any circumstances, we must absolutely not allow the spearhead to be directed at the revolutionary masses. Otherwise, we will deviate from the correct path and make mistakes in direction.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are extremely afraid and hateful of the People's Liberation Army responding to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses. They are doing everything they can to confuse right and wrong, distort facts, spread rumors, and sow discord, playing all sorts of tricks, attempting to sabotage the flesh-and-blood bond between the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionaries, and to turn the spearhead of the struggle against the revolutionary masses. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, timely expose and smash all the tricks of the class enemy, and prevent bad elements from using the instruments of dictatorship to suppress revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres.

Every cadre and soldier in our army must clearly understand that the attitude towards the masses, the attitude towards the proletarian revolutionaries, is an important dividing line between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, is a major indicator of whether the direction of the struggle is correct, and is also a touchstone for testing our class stand.

Chairman Mao said: "Whose side are we on?... We must stand on the side of the people's masses and absolutely not stand on the side of the people's enemies. This is a fundamental issue of the stand of a Marxist-Leninist."

Our People's Liberation Army is a proletarian revolutionary army created and nurtured by the great leader Chairman Mao, and directly led by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must consciously and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wholeheartedly support the broad leftist masses. We must firmly stand on the revolutionary stand of the proletariat, steadfastly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, and not have the slightest hesitation. We must think what the proletarian revolutionaries think, worry about what they worry about, be of one heart, one breath, and one destiny with them, and be their strong rear guard.

The revolutionary youngsters are a new force that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tempered and grown in the great storms of class struggle, and brave warriors defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have always embodied the revolutionary direction. Their immortal achievements for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and their great contributions to the revolutionary people of the motherland are indelible by anyone. Of course, in such an unprecedented great revolutionary movement, they cannot be without shortcomings and may inevitably make this or that mistake. But compared to their great achievements, this is only one finger out of ten. Chairman Mao teaches us: We should not regard those non-essential and non-mainstream issues as essential and mainstream, thus confusing our direction. We should not look at the leftist mass organizations only from the branches, only from a certain time, place, and event, but should look at them from the development process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, from the great direction of the struggle between the two lines, affirm their essence and mainstream, and enthusiastically help them overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes. We must not, because they have some shortcomings and mistakes, look at them with different eyes and not actively support them. Among the revolutionary mass organizations, we should not one-sidedly support one side and suppress the other. For their differences in opinion, we should help them to unite on the basis of a common direction through rectification, self-criticism, and normal discussion and debate, and jointly fight against the enemy.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are deliberately seizing on some shortcomings and mistakes in the progress of the revolutionary mass organizations, attacking one point and ignoring the rest, exaggerating, distorting, and even fabricating rumors, desperately smearing them, attempting to strike them down with one blow. They are also secretly manipulating and vigorously supporting the already collapsed "preservationist" organizations, making them rise from the ashes and re-emerge, suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries, and labeling some revolutionary pioneers as "counter-revolutionaries" again. By doing so, they are counterattacking and taking revenge on the proletarian revolutionaries. In supporting the leftists, the People's Liberation Army must fully recognize and pay attention to this issue. Otherwise, we will make a big mistake. We should, at any time and under any circumstances, direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, at the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, at the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in this region and department, and resolutely support the proletarian revolutionaries. We vow to unite with the broad leftist masses, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

The most fundamental and primary task of our support for the leftists is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and emphasize proletarian politics. We must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and adhere to the mass line. We must be very modest and very cautious, and strictly follow the Party's policies. In this way, we can overcome difficulties, timely correct shortcomings in our work, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and successfully complete the arduous and great task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

    紧紧掌握斗争的大方向
    无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的矛盾。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是最主要最危险的敌人。集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是无产阶级文化大革命从始到终都要坚持的斗争大方向。
    我们人民解放军在支持左派广大群众的斗争中，面临着极其尖锐激烈的阶级斗争，情况是错综复杂的。当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不甘心他们的失败，正在勾结牛鬼蛇神，网罗社会渣滓，用极其阴险毒辣的手段，拚命转移斗争目标，对无产阶级革命派进行疯狂的阶级报复，掀起了一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流。在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们每个干部战士，一定要高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，紧紧地和广大左派群众站在一起，坚决把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们考虑和处理一切问题，都必须从这个大方向出发，都必须服从这个大方向，在任何时候，任何情况下，都绝对不允许把矛头指向革命群众。否则，就会走到邪路上去，就会犯方向的错误。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对于人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决支持左派广大群众，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们极力混淆黑白，颠倒是非，造谣惑众，挑拨离间，玩弄种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏人民解放军和无产阶级革命派的血肉联系，把斗争矛头引向革命群众。我们必须保持高度的革命警惕，及时识破和粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，严防坏人利用专政工具镇压革命群众和革命干部。
    我军每一个干部战士必须明确地认识到：对待群众的态度，对待无产阶级革命派的态度，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的重要分界线，是辨别斗争大方向是否正确的主要标志，也是检验我们阶级立场的试金石。
    毛主席说：“我们站在那一边？……必须站在人民群众这一边，绝不能站到人民敌人那一边去。这是一个马克思列宁主义者的根本立场问题。”
    我们人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和培育的、毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅直接领导的无产阶级革命军队。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们必须自觉地坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全心全意地支持左派广大群众。我们一定要站稳无产阶级的革命立场，坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，绝不能有半点含糊。我们一定要想无产阶级革命派所想，急无产阶级革命派所急。和他们心连心，同呼吸，共命运，作他们的坚强后盾。
    革命小将是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出的新生力量，是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长的，是保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英勇战士。他们始终体现着革命的大方向。他们为无产阶级文化大革命建立的不朽功勋，他们为祖国革命人民作出的伟大贡献，是任何人所抹煞不了的。当然，在这样史无前例的大革命运动中，他们不可能没有缺点，难免会犯这样那样的错误。但是，这同他们的伟大功绩比较起来，只不过是十个指头中的一个指头。毛主席教导我们：不应当将那些非本质方面、非主流方面的问题，看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。我们对左派群众组织，不能只从枝节上去看，只从一时一地一事去看，而要从无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的发展过程，从两条路线斗争的大方向上去看，肯定他们的本质和主流，满腔热情地帮助他们克服缺点，改正错误。绝不能因为他们有某些缺点错误，就另眼相看，不积极支持他们。在革命群众组织之间，不能片面支持一方，压制另一方。对于他们之间的意见分歧，应该帮助他们通过整风，通过自我批评，通过正常的讨论、辩论，求得在大方向一致的基础上团结起来，共同对敌。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，别有用心地抓住革命群众组织前进中的某些缺点和错误，攻其一点，不及其余，极力夸大，肆意歪曲，甚至无中生有，制造谣言，拚命往他们脸上抹黑，企图把他们一棍子打死。他们并且暗中操纵，竭力扶植已经垮了台的“保字号”组织，使它们死灰复燃，重新抬头，压制无产阶级革命派，把一些革命闯将重新打成“反革命”。他们这样干，就是向无产阶级革命派反攻倒算，进行阶级报复。我们人民解放军在支持左派工作中，必须充分地认识和重视这个问题。否则，就会犯绝大的错误。我们应该在任何时候，在任何情况下，都要把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，指向本地区、本部门党内走资本主义道路的当权派，都要坚决为无产阶级革命派撑腰。我们誓同左派广大群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们支持左派的斗争，最根本的首要的，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治。我们要相信群众，依靠群众，坚持群众路线。我们要非常谦虚，非常谨慎，不折不扣地按党的方针政策办事。这样，就能克服困难，及时改正工作中的缺点，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，胜利地完成毛主席交给我们的艰巨而又伟大的任务。
                                    （四月十日）
