One day, while the soldiers of the machine gun company of the Third Battalion of a certain unit stationed in Yujiang, Hunan, were transporting soil to the levee, some of the soil baskets fell into the lake due to the strong waves. This incident was noticed by the model soldier Peng Mingcheng, who heard about it and felt deeply pained. He thought: Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must be thrifty to make revolution," these soil baskets are state property, the fruits of the people's labor, how can we just throw them away? We must retrieve them.

That very night, he quietly arranged with four other soldiers to use the next day's rest time to go and retrieve the baskets. Unfortunately, the weather changed suddenly the next day, with wind and snow. However, the rest time could not be missed, so they braved the wind and snow, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and rushed to the construction site. They launched the empty soil-transporting boat and began the battle to retrieve the baskets. As they retrieved the baskets, they recited "The Three Constantly Read Articles," regardless of their hands turning red from the cold or their feet going numb, they fought against the wind, snow, and waves from 8 AM to 3 PM, a total of seven hours. They retrieved 27 baskets of soil, completing the retrieval mission. When they returned with the joy of victory, they were very excited and said: "Although we retrieved only 27 baskets of soil, we gained a spiritual treasure worth a thousand times more—the glorious tradition of 'being thrifty to make revolution.'"

    风雪湖上捞土筐
    一天，驻湖南沅江某部三营机枪连同志驾船往大堤运土的时候，由于风浪太大，船上有一部分土筐掉到湖里去了。此事被五好战士彭明成知道了，他听在耳里，痛在心里。他想：毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”，土筐是国家的财产，是人民的血汗，怎么能随便丢掉呢？一定要把它捞回来。
    当晚，他便悄悄约了四个战士，确定利用第二天休息的机会，前去打捞。不料，第二天气候突变，风雪交加。可是，休息的时间不能错过，他们还是顶着风，冒着雪，唱着毛主席语录歌，奔到工地，驾起运土的空船，投入捞筐的战斗。他们一边打捞，一边背诵“老三篇”，不管手冻红了，也不顾脚冻麻了，从上午八点到下午三点，整整同风雪波涛搏斗了七个小时，捞了二十七担土筐，完成了打捞任务。当他们怀着胜利的喜悦，踏上归途的时候，十分激动地说：“我们捞着的虽然只是二十七担土筐，但我们得到的却是比它高千万倍的精神收获——“要节约闹革命”的光荣传统。石彦
