To celebrate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the commemorative stamp "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought" is issued in Beijing.

New China News Agency, April 19th: The commemorative stamp "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought," which shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, will be issued in the capital starting from the 20th. This set of stamps is issued by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to celebrate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and to meet the desire of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. It is decided to be issued in advance.

This set of commemorative stamps consists of eleven stamps, each with a unique design. The first stamp features our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate, radiant and smiling, dressed in military uniform, wearing a Red Guard armband, and waving to the revolutionary people with a vibrant and energetic demeanor. The other ten stamps feature golden quotes from Chairman Mao. Among them are: "The core of leadership for our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis that guides our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" and so on.

During the design process of this set of stamps, a small clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road created countless obstacles and delays. They used their authority to say, "The political color is too strong, it cannot be issued," or "Foreigners won't understand these stamps, let's postpone the matter." In short, they created various excuses, all with the same goal: to prevent Mao Zedong Thought from occupying the stamp arena. Contrarily, for a long time, they had been filling the stamp designs with emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, flowers, birds, fish, and other things, completely failing to highlight proletarian politics. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the revolutionary workers of the stamp issuance bureau have risen up to rebel against them, joining forces with the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Stamp Factory. They broke through numerous obstacles and finally successfully designed this set of commemorative stamps that shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

This set of commemorative stamps will soon be issued across the country.

    为庆祝北京市革命委员会成立
    《战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁》纪念邮票在京发行
    新华社十九日讯  闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的纪念邮票《战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁》，于二十日起在首都发行。这套邮票是邮电部为庆祝北京市革命委员会的成立，为满足亿万革命人民的渴望，决定提前发行的。
    这套纪念邮票共有十一枚，由十一个图案组成。第一枚图案，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在天安门城楼上，红光满面，身穿军装，戴着红卫兵袖章，神彩奕奕地向革命人民招手致意的光辉形象。其他十枚的图案，都是金光闪闪的毛主席语录。这里有：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”等等。
    这套纪念邮票在设计过程中，曾受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的百般刁难和阻挠。他们利用职权，一会儿说：“政治色彩太浓，不能发行。”一会儿说：“这种邮票外国人看不懂，暂缓办理”。总之，他们制造种种借口，目的是一个，就是不准毛泽东思想占领邮票阵地。相反地，长期以来，他们却在邮票的画面上大搞帝王将相，才子佳人，花鸟鱼虫等等，根本不突出无产阶级政治。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，邮票发行局的革命职工起来造了他们的反，和北京邮票厂的革命工人结合在一起，冲破重重障碍，终于成功地设计出了这套闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的纪念邮票。
    这套纪念邮票，不久将在全国各地陆续发行。
