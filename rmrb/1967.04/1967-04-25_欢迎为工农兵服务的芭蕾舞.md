The revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," I have watched it three times. It is a stirring performance, a flower that conforms to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Every time I watch it, I feel refreshed, educated, and inspired.

I say this play is good, first of all, because it truly serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. I have seen classical ballet before, both during my visits abroad and in my country. Those performances were all about foreign emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties. In those plays, the poor were merely servants of the emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties. At that time, I thought to myself more than once: History is created by the working people, and the working people should be the masters of history. Our country has been liberated for so many years, and it is already the proletariat who are in power. Why, then, are the stages still occupied by those landlords and capitalist vampires? Why, on the stage, are those evil exploiters still stepping on our bodies and suppressing our politics? Such plays are completely serving the exploiting class. We poor and lower-middle peasants are better off not watching them; if we do, we get angry from the bottom of our hearts. But I heard that a small group of bourgeois "authorities" in the literary and artistic circles say that ballet can only perform ancient emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties, and cannot perform modern plays or plays about workers, peasants, and soldiers; otherwise, it would ruin this art. What nonsense! In reality, it is not that they cannot perform plays about workers, peasants, and soldiers; they just want to use these plays about emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties to poison the people and summon the spirits of capitalism. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers should not listen to this nonsense. They should resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to make literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve proletarian politics. In recent years, revolutionary literary and artistic workers have listened to Chairman Mao and served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating many revolutionary modern plays such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Red Lantern," and "The Red Detachment of Women." The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" performed by the Shanghai Dance School, based on the principle of "foreign for domestic use," has revolutionized ballet, making it a Chinese art form to be performed for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This revolution is good; it completely meets the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The story in the ballet about Yang Bailao and Xi'er being persecuted by the evil landlord Huang Shiren, and the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army rescuing Xi'er from the well, actually represents the common fate of all poor peasants in the old society. Why was Yang Bailao beaten to death? Why was Xi'er driven to despair and into the wilderness? It was because the power was in the hands of the landlord class. After the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army entered the village, the poor people had their own power, and everything changed: Xi'er was liberated, and Huang Shiren was suppressed by the people.

Our Dazhai is the same. Before liberation, Dazhai was famous for its "barren mountains, evil waters, and thin soil." The entire village had about eight hundred mu of land, scattered across seven gullies, eight ridges, and one slope. Even this "land that cannot be broken by a hoe and dried by the wind" was mostly occupied by landlords and rich peasants. More than half of the poor and lower-middle peasants worked for the landlords, doing odd jobs, and being servants. After a year of hard labor, they could barely eat enough and keep warm. But that was their world, and the power was in their hands. Where could we go to seek justice? Only after Dazhai was liberated and the poor and lower-middle peasants had their own power did we see the light of day. From then on, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, organized themselves, from individual farming to mutual aid teams, from mutual aid teams to agricultural cooperatives, from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes, and strode forward on the road to socialism.

However, the enemy does not give up easily. They use every means to sabotage and try to overthrow the people's regime. On the road to collectivization, every step forward we took was met with opposition from the landlords and rich peasants. They played tricks openly and secretly, trying to sabotage collectivization. The number one capitalist-roader in the party, with a heart different from the poor and lower-middle peasants, sang the same tune as the class enemies. He advocated developing capitalist economics in the countryside, shouting "long-term protection of the rich peasant economy," wanting the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to continue living like cattle and horses. During the three years of difficulty, he came out again to advocate "three freedoms and one contract," stirring up a black wind of individual farming in the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai resolutely resisted this evil trend. Why do we do this? The commune members said well: We want socialism, not capitalism; we want common prosperity, not small collectives and individual enrichment. This is a struggle between two classes and two roads. We must closely follow Chairman Mao, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and walk all the way on the road to socialism. We must fight and overthrow the number one capitalist-roader in the party, so that we will not suffer the same hardships as Yang Bailao and Xi'er.

We poor and lower-middle peasants love to watch revolutionary modern plays like "The White-Haired Girl." It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampens the arrogance of the exploiting class. It can educate us to never forget class and class struggle. I hope that in the future, revolutionary modern plays will be performed extensively, so that Mao Zedong Thought can thoroughly occupy our stages.

### 欢迎为工农兵服务的芭蕾舞

    欢迎为工农兵服务的芭蕾舞
    山西省革命委员会副主任
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记  陈永贵
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，我前前后后看过三次。这是一出激动人心的好戏，是符合毛泽东文艺思想的一朵香花。我每次看，都觉得挺新鲜，很受教育，很受鼓舞。
    我说这个戏好，头一宗是因为它是真正为我们工农兵服务的。古典的芭蕾舞，我早先出国访问时看过，在国内时也曾看过。那些戏，演的尽是洋的帝王将相，洋的才子佳人的事。在那些戏里，穷苦人只是帝王将相、才子佳人的奴才。那时候，我就不止一次想过：历史是劳动人民创造的，劳动人民应该是历史的主人。咱们国家解放这么多年了，早已是无产阶级当家作主，为啥在戏剧舞台上还尽让那帮地主、资产阶级吸血鬼霸占着？为啥在戏剧舞台上还尽让那些万恶不赦的剥削阶级老爷踩着咱们穷人的身子骨，专咱们无产阶级的政？这种戏完全是为剥削阶级服务的，我们贫下中农不看还好，看了打心眼里生气。可是，听说文艺界的一小撮资产阶级“权威”们说什么：芭蕾舞只能演古代的帝王将相，才子佳人，不能演现代戏，不能演工农兵，要不，就把芭蕾这门艺术糟踏了。真是鬼话连篇。说穿了，哪是不能演工农兵，分明是想用这些帝王将相、才子佳人的戏来毒害人民群众，给资本主义招魂。革命的文艺工作者们不能听这一套，应该坚决按照毛主席的指示，要叫文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。这几年来，革命的文艺工作者听毛主席的话，为工农兵服务，创造出了《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》等许多革命现代戏。上海市舞蹈学校这次演出的《白毛女》，根据“外为中用”的原则，对芭蕾舞进行了一个革命，使它变成中国的东西，演给工农兵看。这个革命革得好，完全合乎工农兵群众的需要。
    舞剧中的杨白劳和喜儿一家被恶霸地主黄世仁迫害，共产党和八路军把喜儿从苦井里救了出来的故事，实际上代表了旧社会所有贫苦农民共同的命运。杨白劳为什么会被活活打死？喜儿为什么被逼得走投无路钻进了荒山？就是因为印把子在地主阶级手里。共产党、八路军进村后，穷人有了自己的政权，就翻过来了：喜儿翻身得解放，黄世仁被人民镇压。
    我们大寨也一样。解放前的大寨，是“穷山恶水土地薄”出了名的。全村八百来亩地，分散在七沟八梁一面坡上。就这一点
  “土块打不烂，风吹遍地干”的瘦地，也大部分被地主富农霸占。贫下中农有一多半给地主扛长活，打短工，当使唤的。劳累一年，落个吃不饱，穿不暖。可那是人家的天下，政权在人家手里，上哪说理去？直到大寨解放，贫下中农有了自己的政权，这才见到了天日。从这以后，大寨的贫下中农坚决听毛主席的话，组织起来，从单干到互助组，从互助组到农业社，从农业社到人民公社，一股劲向社会主义大道上奔。
    可是，敌人是不甘心失败的，他们千方百计地进行破坏，妄想推翻人民的江山。在集体化的路上，我们每向前走一步，都遭到了地主富农的反对，他们明里暗里捣鬼，拚命想拆集体化的台。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，和贫下中农两条心，和阶级敌人唱一个腔调。他鼓吹发展农村的资本主义经济，叫嚷“长期保护富农经济”，要让广大贫下中农继续过那种牛马生活。在三年困难时期，他又跳出来鼓吹“三自一包”，在农村中刮起一阵单干黑风。我们大寨的贫下中农坚决抵制了这种歪风邪气。我们为啥要这样做呢？社员们说得好：我们要的是社会主义，不是资本主义；我们要的是共同富裕，不要小集体和个人发财。这是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。我们一定要紧紧跟着毛主席，照着毛主席指引的方向，沿着社会主义大道走到底。我们一定要把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗臭、斗垮，要不，我们还会过杨白劳和喜儿一样的苦日子。
    我们贫下中农最爱看象《白毛女》这样的革命现代戏。它大长了革命人民的志气，大灭剥削阶级的威风。它能教育我们永远不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争。我希望今后大演特演革命现代戏，让毛泽东思想彻底占领我们的戏剧舞台。
