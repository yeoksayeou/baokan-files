The Indonesian reactionary government has been madly launching wave after wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns, wantonly destroying the relations between the two countries. This has aroused the extreme indignation of the revolutionary masses in the capital. Starting from yesterday, groups of revolutionary masses have been marching to the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China to protest strongly against the evil deeds of the Indonesian reactionaries in opposing China and persecuting Chinese, expressing their firm support for the announcement by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Indonesian chargé d'affaires in China, Baren, and counselor Sumarno are unwelcome persons, and firmly supporting the just struggle of the broad masses of Indonesian compatriots against persecution.

The marching and protesting crowds included revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers, and revolutionary cadres. They held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waved copies of the little red book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, and carried placards from all directions towards the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China. The protesters wrote slogans, pasted cartoons, and wrote big-character posters on the walls near the streets leading to the Indonesian Embassy in China, and shouted slogans: Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries! The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be messed with! The Chinese people are not to be trifled with! People also loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as if the reactionaries are something in as much as they can repress people, but in reality they have nothing to be afraid of. The people have nothing to fear from the reactionaries. In long-term historical perspective, the reactionaries are bound to perish. The people are bound to win. This is an inevitable law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to obstruct the wheel of history, revolution is bound to occur and will certainly triumph." "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to obstruct the wheel of history, revolution is bound to occur and will certainly triumph."

The overseas Chinese and Red Guards in the capital, who have a blood debt with the Indonesian reactionaries, were filled with righteous indignation and burning anger when they heard that the Indonesian reactionary government was escalating its persecution of overseas Chinese, openly surrounding our embassy in Indonesia, illegally detaining and holding our consul-general, and declaring our chargé d'affaires in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and our consul-general in Jakarta, Xu Ren, as "unwelcome persons." The overseas Chinese pointed out with righteous indignation: The Indonesian reactionary government's mad slaughter of our compatriots and destruction of the relations between the two countries only shows that they are a group of desperate, struggling beasts. Their days are numbered.

Today, the warriors of the Jingan Mountain Corps of Tsinghua University came to march and protest in the rain from the western suburbs with indignation. They said excitedly: The Indonesian reactionaries incited thugs and even sent military police to launch large-scale attacks and persecute overseas Chinese, further worsening the relations between the two countries. Their methods are extreme. But where there is oppression, there is resistance. The Indonesian reactionaries' persecution of overseas Chinese will only make the overseas Chinese more united and fight more resolutely for self-defense. The warriors of the Jingan Mountain Corps said: We, the little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, salute the patriotic compatriots who are bravely fighting to defend the dignity of the motherland against the Indonesian reactionaries! They said: The struggle of the Indonesian compatriots is not isolated. The powerful socialist motherland is your strong backing. The Indonesian people support you, the seven hundred million people of the motherland support you, and the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee for your struggle against persecution to achieve victory. We warn the Indonesian reactionaries, warn Suharto, Nasution, and these anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people heroes, you owe the Chinese people too much, and you will definitely have to pay the debt. You will absolutely not escape the punishment of the revolutionary people of the world.

All Chinese staff working at the Indonesian Embassy in China also strongly protested to the Indonesian reactionary government, pointing out solemnly: The savage persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese and the illegal infringement of the legitimate rights of our diplomatic personnel by the Indonesian reactionary government are absolutely intolerable.

    首都革命群众示威强烈抗议印尼反动政府疯狂反华罪行
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的
    警告印尼反动派：你们绝对逃脱不了世界革命人民的惩罚
    新华社二十五日讯　印度尼西亚反动政府疯狂地接二连三地掀起反华排华浪潮，肆意破坏两国关系的暴行，激起了首都革命群众无比的愤怒。从昨天起，一队队的革命群众纷纷到印尼驻华大使馆门前游行示威，强烈抗议印尼反动派反华排华的罪恶行为，表示坚决拥护我国外交部宣布印尼驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦和参赞苏玛尔诺为不受欢迎的人，坚决支持广大印尼华侨反迫害的正义斗争。
    游行示威的队伍中有革命工人、农民、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，他们高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手持鲜红的《毛主席语录》，打着标语牌，从四面八方涌向印尼驻华大使馆门前。示威的群众在通往印尼驻华大使馆附近街道的墙上，写标语，贴漫画，刷大字报，并且高呼口号：打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒印尼反动派！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的！中国人民不可侮！人们还高声朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    和印尼反动派有不共戴天之仇的首都归侨和红卫兵小将们，当听到印尼反动政府变本加厉地迫害华侨，公然包围我驻印尼大使馆，非法劫持拘留我总领事，并宣布我驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和我驻雅加达总领事徐仁为“不受欢迎的人”的消息时，他们义愤填膺，怒火万丈。归侨们义正词严地指出：印尼反动政府疯狂屠杀我们的侨胞，破坏两国关系，这只能说明他们是一群走投无路、绝望挣扎的野兽。他们的日子不长了。
    清华大学井冈山兵团的战士，今天以怒不可遏的心情，冒雨从西郊赶来示威游行。他们激动地说：印尼反动派唆使暴徒甚至出动军警大规模地袭击和迫害华侨，并进一步恶化两国关系，其手段无所不用其极。但是那里有压迫，那里就有斗争，印尼反动派迫害华侨的暴行，只能促使华侨进一步团结起来，进行坚决的自卫斗争。井冈山兵团的战士们表示：我们毛主席的红小兵，向为维护祖国尊严正在同印尼反动派进行英勇斗争的爱国侨胞致敬！他们说：印尼侨胞们的斗争不是孤立的，强大的社会主义祖国是你们强有力的靠山，印尼人民支持你们，七亿祖国人民支持你们，战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想是指导你们进行反迫害斗争取得胜利的保证。我们要警告印尼反动派，警告苏哈托、纳苏蒂安这些反共、反华、反人民的英雄好汉们，你们欠中国人民的帐太多了，欠帐一定要偿还，你们绝对逃脱不了世界革命人民的惩罚。
    在印尼驻华大使馆工作的全体中国职工也向印尼反动政府提出最强烈的抗议，他们严正地指出：印尼反动政府野蛮迫害爱国华侨和非法侵犯我国外交人员正当权利的暴行，是绝对不能容忍的。
