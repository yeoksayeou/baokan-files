A resounding victory! A decisive strike! A triumphant blow!

In the afternoon of April 24, in the skies over a certain location in Guangxi, our air force units, brave and tenacious, closely coordinated, in just a few short minutes, completely annihilated two intruding U.S. F-4B fighter jets.

This is a new feat achieved by our powerful People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in defending our country's security and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We enthusiastically hail this brilliant victory!

We extend our highest respect to the combatants of the participating units!

The U.S. aircraft once again violated our airspace, which is another serious provocation against our people. This shows that U.S. imperialism is relentless and evil. It harbors extreme hatred for our people and our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, our Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, who remain highly vigilant, have given it a crushing blow. Well done! Decisive! Triumphant! If the U.S. aggressors dare to come again, we will give them another resounding defeat!

The U.S. invaders in South Vietnam are increasingly mired in an inescapable predicament. After the Guam conference, under the instigation of Soviet modern revisionism, U.S. imperialism has intensified the war while spreading "peace" propaganda. However, the Johnson administration cannot deceive or intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people, nor can it shake the firm resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to support Vietnam and resist the U.S. through military provocations.

Currently, our country is successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching a major criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people and being grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. We are full of confidence and, together with the brotherly Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world, will thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.

The heroic People's Liberation Army's severe punishment of the U.S. aggressors has greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the people nationwide. We must enthusiastically respond to the call for supporting the army and loving the people, and further strengthen the unity between the military and the people. We will bravely advance to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to oppose U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, and to defend our great motherland!

    打得好！打得干脆！打得痛快！
    本报评论员
    四月二十四日下午，在广西某地上空，我空军部队，英勇顽强，密切协同，在短短几分钟时间内，一举全歼了悍然入侵我国领空的美国强盗F—4B型战斗机两架。
    这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的我强大的人民解放军为保卫祖国安全，保卫无产阶级文化大革命而建立的新功勋。
    我们热烈欢呼这一光辉胜利！
    我们向参战部队的指战员致以崇高的敬意！
    美国飞机再一次侵犯我国领空，这是对我国人民的又一次严重挑衅。这说明美帝国主义狼心不死，十恶不赦。它极端仇视我国人民，极端仇恨我国无产阶级文化大革命。但是，保持着高度戒备的中国人民和中国人民解放军，给了它一个迎头痛击。打得好！打得干脆！打得痛快！如果美国强盗胆敢再来，我们照样狠狠地打！打它个惨败再惨败！
    美国侵略者在南越战场上，越来越陷入无法摆脱的困境。关岛会议之后，美帝国主义在苏联现代修正主义的怂恿下，一面加紧战争升级，一面大放“和平”烟幕。但是，约翰逊政府既骗不了、吓不倒英雄的越南人民，也休想用军事挑衅的手段，动摇伟大的七亿中国人民援越抗美的坚强决心。
    当前，我国正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命，开展对我国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的大批判，毛泽东思想更加深入人心，越来越为广大革命群众所掌握。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，是最大的战斗力。我们充满信心，和兄弟的越南人民一道，和全世界的革命人民一道，把美帝国主义彻底打倒。
    英雄的人民解放军对美国强盗的严厉惩罚，极大地鼓舞了全国人民的斗争意志。我们要热烈响应拥军爱民的号召，军民更加紧密团结起来，为把我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为反对美帝国主义、反对现代修正主义，为保卫我们伟大的祖国而奋勇前进！
