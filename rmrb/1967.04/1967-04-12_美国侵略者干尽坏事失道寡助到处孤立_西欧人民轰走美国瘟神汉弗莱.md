American Vice President Hubert Humphrey recently traveled through Western Europe advocating for American imperialist aggression policies. Wherever he went, he was met with fierce resistance from the people, like a rat crossing the street, everyone wants to beat it. This is the punishment of Western European people against American imperialist crimes, and it is a manifestation of their growing awakening.

Humphrey left Washington on March 26. He visited the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, West Germany, France, and Belgium. One of his purposes in visiting Western Europe was to promote the U.S. policy in Vietnam, to exonerate and justify American crimes, and to attempt to gain sympathy and support. He spread the idea in Western Europe that the United States hopes to "seek a peaceful solution to the Vietnam problem" and declared that the U.S. government "does not want to be the world's policeman." However, the awakening people of Western Europe have long seen through the hypocritical face of American imperialists and their wolfish ambitions. As soon as Humphrey arrived in Western Europe, he was engulfed in the protest and demonstration voices of the people against the U.S. war in Vietnam, causing him to be terrified and disheveled. He was surrounded by angry crowds everywhere, and the slogans "Humphrey, murderer in Vietnam!" and "Humphrey, go back!" echoed around him.

The people of various Western European countries used various methods to express their protest against this war demon: Paris residents burned the American flag and smashed the windows of the U.S. Information Agency; London crowds wrote "Get out, murderer!" and other slogans on the streets where Humphrey went; demonstrators in Bonn burned a dummy of Johnson in front of the U.S. Embassy; the public in Rome distributed leaflets strongly protesting against the U.S. war in Vietnam.

According to Western news agencies, Humphrey was met with fierce resistance from local people in many Western European cities during his activities, making a fool of himself. When he visited the opera house in Rome dressed elegantly, a can of yellow paint suddenly flew at him from the side, splashing him all over, making him laughable. In another Italian city, Florence, Humphrey had just arrived and was hit in the face by half a lemon while getting into a car, forcing him to "raise his hands to cover his wet face." When he got out of the car, he was hit by a potato thrown from a window. Learning from this "experience," Humphrey chose to ride in a "bus-like large vehicle" instead of a majestic car in West Berlin to avoid attracting attention and being beaten again. In Paris, where Humphrey claimed to have had a "very pleasant day," he was too frightened to attend a banquet due to the protests around his hotel. When he went to lay a wreath at the Washington Monument, he saw protesters again and hurriedly threw down the wreath and fled, with his escort motorcade catching up to him only after he had run a long distance.

The Western European people's angry protests and fierce resistance against Humphrey, this war demon, made the ruling classes of these countries panic. They sent out large numbers of police and police cars to suppress the demonstrators, even arresting many demonstrators, and took so-called "strictest security measures." Wherever Humphrey went, the police were densely deployed, as if facing a major enemy. However, neither brutal suppression nor strict security could stop the anti-American tide of the Western European people. After touring Western Europe for two weeks, Humphrey finally had to endure the people's angry reproaches and slink back to the United States amidst a chorus of protests on April 10.

    美国侵略者干尽坏事失道寡助到处孤立
    西欧人民轰走美国瘟神汉弗莱
    据新华社十一日讯　美国副总统汉弗莱，最近在西欧为美帝国主义侵略政策奔波游说，所到之处无不遭到人民群众的迎头痛击，犹如过街老鼠，人人喊打。这是西欧人民对美帝国主义侵略罪行的惩罚，是他们日益觉醒的表现。
    汉弗莱是三月二十六日离开华盛顿的。他先后到荷兰、意大利、英国、西德、法国和比利时等地进行活动。他到西欧活动目的之一是推销美国的侵越政策，为美国的罪行开脱、辩解，妄图争取同情和支持。他在西欧大肆散布什么美国希望就越南问题“谋求和平解决办法”，表白美国政府“不想成为世界警察”。但是，正在觉醒的西欧人民早就识破了美帝国主义者这种伪善面貌，看透了他们的狼子野心。汉弗莱一到西欧就陷入了西欧人民反对美国侵越战争的抗议示威声中，惊恐万状、狼狈不堪。他到处被愤怒的人群包围起来，周围响彻“汉弗莱，在越南的杀人犯！”“汉弗莱滚回去！”的口号声。
    西欧各国群众采取了多种多样的办法，表示他们对这个战争瘟神的抗议：巴黎的居民焚烧了美国星条旗，砸碎了美国新闻署的玻璃窗；伦敦的群众在汉弗莱所到之处的街头、路上都写上：“滚蛋，杀人犯！”等标语；波恩的示威者在美国大使馆前焚烧约翰逊的模拟人像；罗马的公众则散发传单，强烈抗议美国的侵越战争。
    据西方通讯社报道，汉弗莱在许多西欧城市活动时，遭到当地人民迎头痛击，洋相百出。当他衣冠楚楚访问罗马歌剧院时，突然从旁边飞来一罐黄漆，溅得他满身都是，啼笑皆非。在另一个意大利城市佛罗伦萨，汉弗莱刚到达不久，就在上小轿车时被半个柠檬击中脸部，因此就不得不“举起手来捂着他那被打湿的脸”，而在下车时又被一个从窗口投出来的土豆击中。鉴于这种“经验”，汉弗莱到西柏林后，就不坐威风凛凛的小轿车，而宁愿乘“象公共汽车那样的大车”，以免引人注目，继续挨打。在汉弗莱自称度过了“十分愉快的一天”的巴黎，由于群众在他的旅馆周围示威，吓得他不敢出去参加宴会，而当他去向华盛顿像献花圈时，一看到又有群众示威，就慌忙扔下花圈溜走，护送他的摩托车队在他跑了很远以后才追上他。
    西欧人民对汉弗莱这个战争瘟神的愤怒抗议和迎头痛击，使这些国家的统治集团慌了手脚。他们一面派出大批警察、警车镇压示威群众，甚至逮捕大批示威者，一面采取所谓“最严密的保安措施”。汉弗莱所到之处，都是警察密布，如临大敌。但是，无论是残酷的镇压还是森严的戒备，都阻挡不了西欧人民反美的怒潮。汉弗莱在西欧转游了两周之后，终于不得不饱尝着人民对他的愤怒斥责，于十日在一片抗议声中灰溜溜地滚回美国。
