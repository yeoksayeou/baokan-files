	Indonesian reactionaries, acting on the orders of U.S. imperialism, are hastening to collude with the Thanom group in Thailand to plot the formation of a new anti-China alliance in the Southeast Asian region.

	According to a report by the Associated Press, Adam Malik, the foreign minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, arrived in Bangkok on the 10th and held talks with the Thanom group on the establishment of a so-called "Southeast Asian Regional Cooperation Organization." Malik said on his way back from Bangkok via Singapore on the 11th that the initiative for this regional organization came from Indonesia. Its members include Indonesia, Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines.

	Malik's remarks indicate that this regional organization is a component of the anti-China encirclement ring being assembled by U.S. imperialism.

	According to reports from Thai newspapers, Malik also exchanged views with Thai Foreign Minister Komarn on the current situation in Asia and Vietnam during his stay in Bangkok. Both Malik and Komarn expressed their willingness to serve U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" deception on the Vietnam issue.

    印尼反动派为美帝侵略亚洲效劳
    马利克到泰国勾结他侬拼凑新的反华联盟
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权根据美帝国主义的意旨，正在加紧同泰国他侬集团勾结，阴谋在东南亚地区拼凑新的反华联盟。
    据美联社报道，印尼右派军人政权外交部长阿达姆·马利克十日到达曼谷，同他侬集团就在东南亚地区拼凑所谓“东南亚地区性合作机构”进行了会谈。马利克十一日从曼谷回国途中路经新加坡时对报界说，拼凑这个地区性机构是由印尼“倡议”的。它的成员包括印度尼西亚、泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾等。
    马利克的谈话表明，这个地区性机构是美帝国主义拼凑的反华包围圈的一个组成部分。
    另据泰国报纸报道，马利克在曼谷期间，还同泰国外交部长科曼就当前亚洲和越南局势交换了意见。马利克和科曼都表示愿为美帝国主义在越南问题上推行“和谈”骗局效劳。
