The great call by Chairman Mao for "three-in-one combination" to seize power has illuminated the path forward for the revolutionary masses of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant. However, some members of the rebel factions have been influenced by the reactionary trend of the bourgeoisie, which advocates "opposing everything, overthrowing everything, and excluding everything." They mistakenly believe that "all cadres are implementing the bourgeois reactionary line and should be sidelined." This has hindered the deepening of the struggle to seize power.

In response to this situation, we, the proletarian revolutionaries, held two consecutive meetings. During these meetings, we seriously studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." "We must be good at identifying cadres. We must not only look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but also at the cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Chairman Mao's teachings helped us realize that we must use a class analysis perspective to view cadres. The key to determining whether a person is revolutionary is whether they support Chairman Mao, whether they support Mao Zedong Thought, and whether they support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We cannot use the distinction between "masses" and "cadres" as the criterion for determining who is revolutionary and who is not. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," we further understood that in addition to uniting with cadres who have already stood on the side of the revolutionaries, we should also unite with those leaders who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them.

Through repeated study and discussion, we all agreed: We revolutionaries must follow Chairman Mao's words. Through struggle, we must not only unite more than 95% of the masses but also more than 95% of the cadres. If we do not distinguish between bourgeois elements in power and proletarian elements in power and overthrow them all, we will fall into the trap set by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. The capitalist-roaders within the Party are only a handful. For those cadres who have made this or that mistake, we should unite with them, educate them, and start from the desire for unity. Through criticism and struggle, we should bring them back to the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

However, how do we do a good job of uniting and educating cadres? We again studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system. It helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." We realized that many cadres made mistakes during this Cultural Revolution because they had long been detached from the masses and labor. To truly make cadres who have made mistakes recognize and correct their errors, we must let them interact more with the masses and participate in labor within their capabilities. After participating in labor, some cadres said, "Previously, when the masses said I was acting like an official, I felt wronged. After participating in labor, I truly felt that I did not understand the situation below, which is one of the reasons for the shortcomings and errors in my work. The revolutionary comrades' criticism of me is correct." This approach not only helps cadres who have made mistakes recognize their errors but also reduces their resistance to the revolutionaries.

At the same time, we conducted more detailed ideological education for cadres who made mistakes. First, we analyzed the situation of the cadres: Our workshop's production director is an old worker. Although he signed documents and made promises during the economic wind of capitalism, he was merely an unconscious executor. Moreover, he had been suppressed by the capitalist-roaders in power in the past. We believed that we should first win him over and encourage him to rebel. We pointed out to him: To become a revolutionary leader trusted by the masses, it is not only important to work diligently in labor but more importantly to examine and criticize one's own errors before the masses, to revolutionize one's soul, and to fiercely oppose the capitalist-roaders in power. When we talked to him, he was moved and said, "I have many shortcomings and mistakes in the past. Through studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and through the criticism and help of revolutionary comrades, I realized that my past views on the revolutionary faction were wrong and that I did not truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I am willing to examine my mistakes before the broad revolutionary workers." Everyone thought his attitude of self-criticism was quite sincere, so we let him continue to take on leadership work.

During the struggle to seize power, because we paid attention to combining with revolutionary cadres, we fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses and cadres. On the day after seizing power, the main cooling water pipe in the workshop froze and cracked. If it was not repaired in time, the entire production would have to be suspended. According to the old framework, it was necessary to report layer by layer. If we did this, the production task for January would definitely not be completed. In this situation, the revolutionaries firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," stepped forward, and together with revolutionary workers and cadres, pooled their wisdom and strength to repair the cooling water pipe at the fastest speed, ensuring the normal operation of production and overfulfilling the January production plan.

Through practice, we deeply felt that the proletarian revolutionaries want to seize power well, hold power well, and use power well, they must combine with revolutionary cadres. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our struggle to seize power to overcome all difficulties and achieve true victory in the struggle to seize power.

    我们是怎样识别、教育和使用革命干部的
    上海钢铁三厂工人革命造反兵团一薄车间大队
    毛主席发出的“三结合”夺权的伟大号召，就象指路明灯一样，照亮了我们上海钢铁三厂革命派的前进道路。但在一部分造反队员中，由于受到资产阶级反动路线“反对一切，打倒一切，排斥一切”的反动思潮的影响，错误地认为：“干部都是执行资产阶级反动路线的，都要让他们靠边站。”这就阻碍了夺权斗争的深入开展。
    针对这种情况，我们无产阶级革命派连续召开了两次会议。会上，认真地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”毛主席的教导，使我们认识到：一定要用阶级分析的观点看待干部。区别一个人是不是革命的，主要看他是否拥护毛主席，是否拥护毛泽东思想，是否拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。决不能以“群众”和“干部”来作为划分革命和不革命的标准。我们学习了毛主席关于“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的指示后，进一步认识到：除了要团结原来就站在革命派一边的干部外，还应该团结那些虽然犯了错误，但愿意改正错误的领导干部。
    通过反复学习和讨论，大家一致认为：我们革命派一定要听毛主席的话，经过斗争不仅要团结百分之九十五以上的群众，还应该团结百分之九十五以上的干部。如果不分资产阶级当权派，还是无产阶级当权派，统统打倒，这就是上了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的当，中了他们的计。党内走资本主义道路的当权派仅仅是一小撮。对待那些犯有这样或那样错误的干部，应该是团结他们、教育他们，从团结的愿望出发，通过批评、斗争，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线一边来。
    但是，如何做好对干部的团结、教育工作呢？我们又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”我们体会到：许多干部在这次文化大革命中所以会犯错误，同他们长期以来脱离群众、脱离劳动是分不开的。要真正使犯了错误的干部，认识错误，改正错误，必须让他们多与群众接触，参加些力所能及的劳动。干部参加劳动后，有的说：“以前群众说我做官当老爷，我觉得委屈。参加劳动后，确实感到以前是不了解下面的情况，这是在工作中产生缺点和错误的原因之一。革命同志对我的批评是对的。”这样做，既使犯错误的干部对自己的错误有所认识，也使他们减少了对革命派的抵触情绪。
    同时，我们对犯错误的干部还做了比较细致的思想教育工作。首先，我们分析了干部的情况：我们车间生产主任是老工人出身。虽然在大刮经济主义黑风时，他也曾经签过字、许过愿。但是，他只是一个不自觉的执行者，而且过去他是受走资本主义道路当权派的排挤的。我们认为应该首先争取他，鼓励他起来闹革命。并向他指出：要做一个群众信得过的革命领导干部，不仅在劳动上踏踏实实地干，更重要的要向群众检查和批判自己的错误，在灵魂深处闹革命，大造走资本主义道路当权派的反。我们在和他谈话时，他激动地说：“我过去有许多缺点和错误，通过学习《为人民服务》，通过革命同志的批评和帮助，认识到过去对革命派的看法是错误的，没有真正站在毛主席的革命路线上来，我愿意向广大革命职工检查错误。”大家认为他检讨的态度比较诚恳，因此，仍让他担任领导工作。
    在夺权斗争过程中，由于我们注意了和革命领导干部的结合，就充分调动了广大革命群众和革命干部的积极性。在夺权后的一天，车间总冷却水管冻裂了，如果不及时修复，全部生产就要被迫停工。按照过去的“老框框”，总是要层层上报。要是这样做，一月份的生产任务肯定不能完成。在这种情况下，革命派坚决贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，挺身而出，和革命职工、革命干部一起，群策群力，以最快的速度修复了冷却水管，保证了生产的正常进行，超额完成了一月份生产计划。
    通过实践，使我们深深体会到：无产阶级革命派要想夺好权、掌好权和用好权，必须和革命干部结合起来。我们必须用毛泽东思想来指导我们的夺权斗争，才能克服一切困难，取得夺权斗争的真正胜利。
