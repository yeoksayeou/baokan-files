The entire nation's revolutionary masses resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call: trust the People's Liberation Army, rely on the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and definitely unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight alongside it, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, April 29th — After studying the editorial "Respond Warmly to the Call for Supporting the Army and Loving the People" from the sixth issue of 1967 of the *Red Flag* magazine, revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses across the country have increasingly deeply understood that the teaching of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything," is an everlasting and great truth. Revolutionary masses in various places say that to trust and rely on the masses, trust and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and trust and rely on the majority of cadres is Chairman Mao's latest directive, and it is also the most important guarantee for conducting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well. We will definitely execute and implement this resolutely to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	After the editorial from the *Red Flag* magazine, which conveys our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives, was published in newspapers across the country, revolutionary masses eagerly spread the word and eagerly read it. They reflected that the People's Liberation Army is a great revolutionary army personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, an army armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and an army that is closely connected with the workers and peasants. The People's Liberation Army has created immortal merits for the proletarian revolutionary cause in the past and is now making new great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The People's Liberation Army not only knows how to fight but also knows how to do mass work, propaganda work, and production work. It is our strongest backbone and our best example to learn from. We will definitely respond warmly to Chairman Mao's great call, enthusiastically support the Liberation Army, strive to learn from the Liberation Army, and resolutely support the Liberation Army. We will unite with the People's Liberation Army as one, with one heart, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Revolutionary workers, peasants, cadres, and Red Guards across the country, after studying this editorial, many people joyfully said that we have such an invincible army, the People's Liberation Army, which is the happiness of the Chinese people. They said that we must take the People's Liberation Army as an example and humbly learn from them to carry out the revolutionization of thought. Many revolutionary youngsters in various places expressed that we must learn the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics and actively studying Chairman Mao's works, learn the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army in adhering to the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, and learn the high organizational discipline of the People's Liberation Army. We must be like the Liberation Army, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and fiercely seize the power of the "self" in our minds, consciously overcome erroneous thoughts such as anarchism, sectarianism, extremism, and individualism. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres in various places also expressed that they will definitely, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, unite more closely with the People's Liberation Army, and like the Liberation Army, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in this region and unit, and complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation in this region and unit.

	The great People's Liberation Army has done a great deal of work and achieved significant results in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, making important contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses in various places, after studying the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine, based on their personal experiences, enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army as the pillar of proletarian dictatorship and the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary masses. They said that we must cherish the People's Liberation Army as we cherish our own eyes, actively support and proactively help the Liberation Army to better carry out the work of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the Liberation Army to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many proletarian revolutionary masses who have formed close combat friendships with comrades of the Liberation Army in joint struggles said that the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of the People's Liberation Army supporting the broad leftist masses. They maliciously incite some people with ulterior motives to viciously attack the People's Liberation Army, which we will not allow! They also said that since the People's Liberation Army intervened in the local Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are terrified and enraged. They use every means to sow discord and create divisions, attempting to sabotage military-civilian unity. We must resolutely expose their tricks. Revolutionary masses across the country resolutely expressed that in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, we will forever unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight alongside it, and achieve victory with it.

    全国广大革命群众坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召
    相信解放军　依靠解放军  学习解放军
    一定和解放军团结在一起战斗在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社二十九日讯　全国各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众学习了《红旗》杂志一九六七年第六期社论《热烈响应拥军爱民的号召》以后，越来越深刻地认识到，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的教导，是永远颠扑不破的伟大真理。各地无产阶级革命派说，要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数，这是毛主席的最新指示，也是搞好无产阶级文化大革命的最重要的保证。我们一定坚决执行，坚决照办，以夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    当传达我们伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的《红旗》杂志社论在各地报纸上发表以后，广大革命群众奔走相告，争相传阅。他们纷纷反映说，中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接指挥的伟大革命军队，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，是全心全意为人民服务的军队，是同工农劳动人民血肉相连的军队。人民解放军过去为无产阶级革命事业创立了不朽的功勋，今天又在为无产阶级文化大革命作出新的伟大贡献。人民解放军不仅会打仗，而且会做群众工作、宣传工作和生产工作，是我们的最强大的后盾，是我们的最好的学习榜样。我们一定坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，热烈拥护解放军，努力学习解放军，坚决支持解放军，要同人民解放军拧成一股绳，结成一条心，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    各地广大革命派工人、农民、干部和红卫兵小将们学习了这篇社论以后，许多人都欢欣鼓舞地说，我们能有中国人民解放军这样一支战无不胜的军队，这是中国人民的幸福。他们说，我们一定要以人民解放军为榜样，虚心地向他们学习，搞好思想革命化。许多地方的革命小将们表示，我们一定把人民解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的经验学到手，把人民解放军坚持四个第一、三八作风等优良传统学到手，把人民解放军高度的组织性纪律性学到手。我们要象解放军那样永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，狠夺头脑中“私”字的权，自觉地克服无政府主义、小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义等错误思想。各地的革命工人、贫下中农和革命干部也表示，一定要在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，更加紧密地同人民解放军团结起来，象解放军那样在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批倒斗臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和本地区、本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，胜利完成本地区、本单位斗批改的伟大历史任务。
    伟大的中国人民解放军在支左、支工、支农、军管和军训中作了大量的工作，取得了重大成绩，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了重要贡献。各地革命群众在学习了《红旗》杂志的社论以后，纷纷根据他们的亲身体会，热烈歌颂人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。他们说，我们要象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护我们的人民子弟兵，要满腔热忱地积极地支持和主动地帮助解放军进一步做好支左、支工、支农、军管和军训工作，更好地和解放军并肩战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。许多在共同斗争中和解放军同志结下了亲密的战斗友谊的无产阶级革命派说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派最害怕人民解放军支持左派广大群众，他们妄图煽动一些别有用心的人对人民解放军进行恶毒的攻击，我们决不答应！他们还说，自从人民解放军介入地方文化大革命以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派怕得要命，恨得要死，他们千方百计挑拨离间，制造分裂，妄图破坏军民团结，我们一定要坚决戳穿他们的阴谋诡计。各地广大革命群众坚决表示，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要永远和人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
