The great winds of change are sweeping across the land, and the revolutionary tides are surging forward. Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is shaking the world, is entering its decisive phase with the momentum of "a million heroes crossing the Yangtze," and just as our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao are commanding the billion-strong revolutionary army to launch a total assault on the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital have united, forged solidarity, and assembled in a grand alliance. A momentous event that has shaken the nation and startled the world has occurred: the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ of the capital—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—has been triumphantly established in our great motherland's capital, in the place where our most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, resides, and in the center of the world revolution.

The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks a major, decisive victory for the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, signaling the beginning of a new phase in the struggle.

It has pronounced the death sentence on the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who, under the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, had been entrenched in the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee.

It has declared the downfall of the new Municipal Party Committee, which has also collapsed along with the bankruptcy of its bourgeois reactionary line.

Thunder roars, and banners flutter. As the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital joyously celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and sincerely sing praises to Chairman Mao's great proletarian revolutionary line, they are holding high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, taking up the pen as a sword, and aiming directly at the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. One criticism meeting after another, one big-character poster after another, one leaflet after another—speaking and writing with pen and ink, concentrating firepower, and denouncing China's Khrushchev, fiercely criticizing "Self-Cultivation"! This fully demonstrates the immense power of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital uniting to fight.

A thousand streams flow into the sea.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital have gradually united through struggle. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the foundation and soul of their great unity.

Their glorious battle journey has been along the direction indicated by our great helmsman Chairman Mao. Wherever Chairman Mao points, they fight. In the great storms of class struggle, a mighty revolutionary army has continuously grown and strengthened.

After our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Peking University, igniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses in the capital swiftly took action and threw themselves into this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in collusion with another major capitalist-roader in power within the Party, put forward and promoted a bourgeois reactionary line to suppress the revolution, strike at the revolution, and encircle the revolutionary masses, imposing white terror on the revolutionary masses. They stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, attempting to suppress the burgeoning, vigorous mass movement. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao gave the greatest support to the proletarian revolutionary masses, dispersing the mist, correcting the course, and pointing out the direction. At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," proclaiming the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line, greatly encouraging the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital. Under the intimate care and support of our great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary masses gained limitless courage to struggle, consciously organizing and uniting to fight against the counter-revolutionary revisionist forces that oppressed them. Thus, the Red Guards and other revolutionary mass organizations emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital have resolutely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and waged a relentless struggle against the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. They repelled the enemy's repeated ferocious counterattacks and thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the new Municipal Party Committee. Through long-term common struggle, they deeply understood: to achieve a thorough victory in the struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses must unite in struggle; only by uniting can they have the strength to better carry out the struggle.

Since late February, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital, under the intimate care of our great leader Chairman Mao and the direct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, have successively held several historic conferences of great significance: the Conference of Representatives of Red Guards from Capital Colleges and Universities (Red Guard Conference), the Conference of Representatives of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Beijing (Peasant Representative Conference), the Conference of Revolutionary Workers' Representatives of Beijing (Worker Representative Conference), and the Conference of Representatives of Red Guards from Capital Middle Schools (Middle School Red Guard Conference). As the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants of Beijing, and the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the Red Guards from capital colleges and universities and middle schools—have united, forged solidarity, and assembled under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, laying a broad and solid mass foundation for the establishment of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ of Beijing—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The great unity, solidarity, and assembly of the revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards in the capital have fully demonstrated the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital, thereby raising the level of struggle to a new height. The broad revolutionary masses in the capital believe that the successful convening of these representative conferences is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, representing the urgent will of the broad proletarian revolutionary masses to achieve great unity. These representative conferences have broad representativeness, as the representatives are from the grassroots of factories, mines, enterprises, rural people's communes, colleges, and middle schools in the city. The standing committees of these representative conferences, formed by the representatives, are the permanent working organs of these revolutionary organizations, products of practicing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. These representative conferences further promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses at the grassroots level of factories, mines, enterprises, rural people's communes, and schools. Thus, the revolutionary organizations established by the proletarian revolutionary masses from the bottom up have, in turn, promoted the proletarian revolutionary masses to further unite from the bottom up.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital believe that the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses must be a revolutionary, combative great unity. This great unity must be unified by Mao Zedong Thought, based on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with the leftists as the core, and with a consistent direction of struggle. This great unity must first be the great unity of the proletarian leftists. Only when the leftists first unite and seize the leadership can they ensure that the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses' great unity are continuously consolidated, strengthened, and elevated, and can they better gradually unite the majority of the masses and cadres, ensuring the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital are uniting to launch an unprecedented large-scale criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents. In this revolutionary criticism, the great unity and "three-in-one combination" of the proletarian revolutionary masses will be further promoted.

In the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, great unity is achieved.

A small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party knows that the time when the proletarian revolutionary masses achieve great unity is the time of their great failure. From the day the proletarian revolutionary masses rose up to struggle, they have, with extreme fear and madness, conspired to sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, attempting to strangle the proletarian revolutionary masses in a state of dispersion and isolation, with extremely malicious intentions.

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in collusion with another major capitalist-roader in power within the Party, made the capital one of their important strongholds, frantically promoting the bourgeois reactionary line. They dispatched numerous work teams to suppress the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." They instigated the masses to fight the masses, the masses to fight the cadres, and the cadres to fight the masses, turning the spearhead of struggle against the proletarian revolutionary masses, sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight, thinking they had gained the upper hand. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party also personally controlled the "points" set up in places like Tsinghua University and the First Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University, spreading counter-revolutionary experience far and wide.

A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, advocated the reactionary "bloodline theory," maliciously sabotaging the Party's class line, creating divisions among the revolutionary young people. They colluded with ghosts and monsters, gathered social dregs, established reactionary organizations like "Lian Dong" and "Red Flag Army," and assembled a counter-revolutionary "rabble" to oppose the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

The masterminds behind this series of sabotage activities are the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and their ultimate backer, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The new Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which was established in June last year, immediately fell into the embrace of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, faithfully executing the bourgeois reactionary line, and did not thoroughly smash and settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee.

The torrent of history is unstoppable. Under the intimate care of Chairman Mao and the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital have seen through the enemy's various tricks and conspiracies, broken through the layers of obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and launched a counterattack against the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, achieving victory after victory. The broad workers, peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in the capital have been widely mobilized, supporting and fighting side by side, rapidly strengthening the ranks of the revolutionary leftists. The proletarian revolutionary masses have finally formed a mighty revolutionary army, launching a power struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

This is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, who have already suffered a crushing defeat, are attempting to save their failing fate by launching a new wave of counter-revolutionary counterattacks to restore capitalism. They disguise themselves, trying to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, promote a fake "three-in-one combination," and usurp the victory fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They use the opportunity of the revolutionary masses' self-criticism to exaggerate some shortcomings in the revolutionary young people's advance, blame their own reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" on the revolutionary young people, and once again direct the spearhead at the revolutionary young people, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary masses.

"Ants trying to shake a tree—how can they succeed!" No matter how many tricks they have, they will ultimately escape the fate of "making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing again, until they perish." The proletarian revolutionary masses, however, have grown stronger and united in the sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

In the revolutionary practice of achieving great unity, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital deeply understand that struggle and unity are dialectically united. Struggle needs unity, and unity is for struggle. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting in the great storms of class struggle and uniting in the struggle between the two lines. As Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a mighty revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." Now, they are launching a powerful total assault on the ultimate backer of the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, seizing decisive new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this crucial battle, the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses will be further consolidated and strengthened.

Great unity is also a revolution of the subjective world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital are doing exactly this. At the critical moment of the proletarian seizure of power, the Red Guards in the capital put forward a revolutionary slogan: Overthrow the "self" and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses! They said, the proletarian revolutionary masses not only have to seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party but must also seize the power of the "self" in their minds.

"Overthrow the power of the 'self' in one's mind!" This revolutionary slogan is so profound and timely! The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital have grown and strengthened under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Their revolutionary vision is far-reaching, and their political sense is acute. They have shown precious revolutionary self-awareness and creativity. When the revolutionary masses discover tendencies of individualism, sectarianism, dispersionism, anarchism, and liberalism in their ranks, they are alert to the fact that the root of these "isms" is the "self." They deeply realize in the struggle that the bourgeois "self" is a corrosive agent, a great enemy of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. If these erroneous tendencies continue to exist, they will disperse the fighting spirit of the proletarian revolutionary masses and will not be able to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, which is what the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party welcomes. The proletarian revolutionary masses must educate themselves in the struggle, while transforming the objective world, carry out a revolution of the subjective world, thoroughly overthrow the "self," and establish the "public," cultivating a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. This is an important condition for the great unity and solidarity of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

Overthrowing the "self" and establishing the "public" is to eliminate the poison of "Self-Cultivation" and establish Mao Zedong Thought. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for overthrowing the "self" and establishing the "public." In factories, rural areas, schools, and offices, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital are everywhere studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and his brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Against Liberalism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" over and over again, fighting while rectifying, and launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. They use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine their thoughts and measure their actions.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: to implement Marx's saying that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. They seriously study this great strategic thought in these teachings, understanding that the proletarian revolutionary masses have come together for a common revolutionary goal. The small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party is the common enemy of the revolutionary masses. The "self" must not be allowed to play tricks in one's mind, and it must not hinder the great unity and solidarity of the revolutionary masses. They must thoroughly criticize and oppose anarchism, consolidate and develop the great unity and solidarity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and concentrate all forces to strike at the common enemy. They believe that the root of all erroneous thoughts, including anarchism, that appear in the ranks of the revolutionary masses is the "self," and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the mad advocate of the "self." This person's deceitful "Self-Cultivation," which does not mention proletarian dictatorship at all, actually advocates bourgeois dictatorship, maliciously promoting the decadent bourgeois worldview, aiming to "cultivate" people into extreme individualists and political careerists with a mind full of "self," and to peacefully evolve into revisionism. The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital have seen through the evil face of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Together with the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, they have launched a revolutionary criticism against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, his bourgeois reactionary line, and the big poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" he concocted. The great criticism has further promoted the great unity, and the proletarian revolutionary masses have united more closely. The revolutionary masses have discarded only the filthy things of the petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie, while gaining the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." On the day of celebrating the great unity, solidarity, and assembly of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Beijing, they firmly remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. They say, unity is for better struggle. Unity is only the beginning, only the first step of a long march. They clearly see in the face of victory: "The enemy will not disappear on its own," "they will make their last struggle." The small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party will still use various means, including utilizing the old habits of force within the revolutionary ranks, to sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, attempting to restore capitalism. Struggle is bound to be repeated and tortuous, and the struggle continues. The road of great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses will not be straight. Consolidating and developing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses, there will be new struggles ahead. However, no matter how the class enemies struggle and sabotage, the wheel of history is unstoppable.

Looking ahead, the task is heavy and the road is long. The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital proudly say, we will definitely always stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, unite more closely, and join the current large-scale criticism struggle, thoroughly overthrowing the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party under his protection!

Comrades in the proletarian revolutionary cause, let us welcome the even greater victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with even more heroic struggles!

    在斗争中联合　联合起来斗争
    ——新华社记者评述首都无产阶级革命派大联合的重大历史意义
    东风浩荡，洪流滚滚。正当一场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，以“百万雄师过大江”的革命气势进入决战阶段；正当我们的最高统帅毛主席和林彪副主席，指挥亿万革命大军，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的关键时刻，首都无产阶级革命派各路大军大联合、大团结、大会师了。一件震动全国、震惊世界的大喜事，北京市革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会，在我们伟大祖国的首都，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席居住的地方，在世界革命的中心，胜利地诞生了。
    北京市革命委员会的成立，标志着首都无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了一个重大的决定性胜利，斗争进入了一个崭新的阶段。
    它宣判了一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派支持下所盘踞的旧北京市委、市人委的死刑。
    它宣告了新市委随着自己执行的资产阶级反动路线的破产也倒台了。
    风雷动，旌旗奋。首都无产阶级革命派，在纵情欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，衷心歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线伟大胜利的时候，正高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，拿起笔做刀枪，直指党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。一个个批判会，一张张大字报，一份份传单，口诛笔伐，集中火力，痛斥中国的赫鲁晓夫，狠批《修养》！充分显示了首都无产阶级革命派联合起来进行斗争的巨大威力。
    千支万流归大海
    首都无产阶级革命派，是在斗争中逐步联合起来的。光焰无际的毛泽东思想，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是他们大联合的基础和灵魂。
    他们的光辉的战斗历程，是沿着我们伟大舵手毛主席指引的方向走过来的。毛主席指到那里，他们战斗到那里。在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军不断发展和壮大了。
    当伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定广播北京大学的全国第一张马克思列宁主义的大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火之后，首都广大革命群众迅速地行动起来，投入到这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中来。但是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，勾结党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，提出和推行一条资产阶级反动路线，来压制革命，打击革命，围剿革命派，对革命群众实行白色恐怖。他们站在资产阶级反动立场上，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，妄图把刚刚起来的轰轰烈烈的群众运动打下去。就在这严重的时刻，毛主席给了无产阶级革命派以最大支持，驱散了弥雾，拨正了船头，指明了航向。在党的八届十一中全会上，毛主席亲自主持制订的“十六条”，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，大大鼓舞了首都无产阶级革命派。无产阶级革命派在伟大统帅毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，增添了无限的斗争勇气，自觉地组织起来，联合起来，向着压迫他们的反革命修正主义势力，展开了更加英勇顽强的斗争。于是，红卫兵和其他革命的群众组织，象雨后春笋般地涌现出来。他们牢牢记住毛主席的亲切教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    一年来，首都无产阶级革命派，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，同旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团，进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂反扑。同时，坚决清算了新市委执行的资产阶级反动路线。在长期的共同斗争中，他们深深懂得：要想取得斗争的彻底胜利，无产阶级革命派必须在斗争中联合起来；只有联合起来才有力量，才能更好地进行斗争。
    二月下旬以来，首都无产阶级革命派，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在中央文革小组的直接领导下，相继召开了具有重大历史意义的首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会（红代会）、北京市贫下中农代表会议（农代会）、北京市革命职工代表会议（工代会）和首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会（中学红代会）。作为无产阶级文化大革命主力军的北京革命职工、贫下中农，和无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋——首都大专院校和中等学校红卫兵小将，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，大联合、大团结、大会师，为北京市革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会的成立，打下了广泛、扎实的群众基础。
    首都革命职工、贫下中农和红卫兵小将大联合、大团结、大会师，充分显示了首都无产阶级革命派的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，从而把斗争提高到更高的水平。首都广大革命群众认为，这几个代表大会
  （代表会议）的胜利召开，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，集中代表了广大无产阶级革命派迫切要求进行大联合的意志，是首都无产阶级革命派创造的大联合的新经验。参加这几个代表大会（代表会议）的代表，都是来自本市厂矿企业、农村人民公社和大专院校、中等学校基层，有广泛的代表性。在代表中产生的代表大会（代表会议）的委员会（常务委员会），是这些革命组织的常设的工作机构，它是在无产阶级专政条件下实行大民主的产物。这些代表大会
  （代表会议）又运用自己组织的革命权威，进一步推进厂矿企业、农村人民公社和学校基层单位的无产阶级革命派的大联合。这样，无产阶级革命派自下而上联合起来建立的革命组织，又反过来自上而下地促进无产阶级革命派进一步自下而上地联合起来。
    首都无产阶级革命派认为，无产阶级革命派的大联合，必须是革命的战斗的大联合。这种大联合，必须是用毛泽东思想统一起来的、以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为基础的、以左派为核心的、斗争大方向一致的大联合。这种大联合，必须首先是无产阶级左派的大联合。只有左派首先联合起来，把领导权握在自己手里，才能保证无产阶级革命派大联合的队伍不断巩固、壮大和提高，才能更好地逐步地团结大多数群众和干部，保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底的胜利。
    当前，首都无产阶级革命派正联合起来，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线，展开一场空前规模的大批判，大斗争。在这场革命的大批判中，也必将进一步推进无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中大联合
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，深知无产阶级革命派大联合之时，就是他们大失败之日。他们从无产阶级革命派奋起斗争的第一天起，就以万分的恐惧，百倍的疯狂，阴谋破坏无产阶级革命派大联合。妄图把无产阶级革命派扼杀在分散孤立的状态之中，用心极为毒辣。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伙同另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把首都作为他们的一个重要据点，疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线。他们大派工作组，四出镇压革命群众，镇压革命干部，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。他们挑动群众斗群众，挑动群众斗干部，挑动干部斗群众，把斗争的矛头转向无产阶级革命派，坐山观虎斗，自以为得计。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，还亲自掌握在清华大学和北京师范大学第一附属中学等地设置的“点”，把反革命经验推而广之。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，宣扬反动的“血统论”，恶毒破坏党的阶级路线，在革命小将中制造分裂。他们勾结牛鬼蛇神，网罗社会渣滓，建立“联动”、“红旗军”等反动组织，拼凑反革命的小“乌合”，对抗无产阶级革命派大联合。
    这一系列阴谋破坏活动的罪魁祸首，就是旧北京市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。而北京新市委去年六月刚一成立，就投入了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的怀抱，忠实地执行了资产阶级反动路线，不去彻底摧毁和清算旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线。
    历史的激流是阻挡不了的。首都无产阶级革命派在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，识破了敌人的种种阴谋诡计，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的层层障碍，大造了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和作为他们总后台的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反，取得了节节胜利。首都广大工农、红卫兵和革命的干部广泛动员起来，互相支援，并肩战斗，迅速壮大了革命左派的阵营。无产阶级革命派终于结成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了夺权斗争。
    这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间的你死我活的斗争。已经遭到惨败的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图挽救他们的失败命运，又掀起一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，进行猖狂的新反扑。他们乔装打扮，妄想钻进革命阵营内部，搞假的“三结合”，篡夺无产阶级文化大革命的胜利果实。他们利用革命派整风的机会，把革命小将前进中的一些缺点无限夸大，把他们自己推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，加罪于革命小将，再次把矛头指向革命小将，妄图搞垮革命派。
      “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”！他们的诡计虽多，终究逃脱不了“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的命运。而无产阶级革命派，却在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐复杂的斗争中，不断壮大起来，联合起来。
    首都无产阶级革命派，在实行大联合的革命实践中，深深懂得，斗争和联合是对立的统一。斗争需要联合，联合为了斗争。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中联合起来，在两条路线的斗争中联合起来。正象毛主席所英明指出的那样：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”现在，他们正在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的总后台发起强大的总攻击，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的新胜利。在这场关键性的大战役中，无产阶级革命派的大联合必将更加巩固，更加壮大。
    大联合也是一场主观世界的革命
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”首都的无产阶级革命派正是这样做的。在无产阶级夺权斗争的关键时刻，首都红卫兵提出了一个革命的口号：打倒“私”字，实行无产阶级革命派大联合！他们说，无产阶级革命派不仅要夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，而且必须夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。
      “夺自己头脑里‘私’字的权”！这个革命口号提得多么深刻，多么及时！首都的无产阶级革命派是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长壮大的，他们的革命眼光远大，政治嗅觉锐敏，他们发扬了可贵的革命自觉性和创造性。革命派在自己的队伍一发现了风头主义、小团体主义、分散主义、无政府主义、自由主义等错误倾向，就警觉到这些“主义”的总根子是“私”字。他们在斗争中深刻地认识到，资产阶级的“私”字是一种腐蚀剂，是无产阶级革命派大联合的大敌。这些错误倾向如果继续存在，就会涣散无产阶级革命派的斗志，就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所欢迎的。无产阶级革命派必须在斗争中自己教育自己，在改造客观世界的同时，进行一场主观世界的革命，大破私字，大立公字，树立全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。这是无产阶级革命派大团结、大联合的重要条件。
    打倒“私”字，大立“公”字，就是肃清《修养》的流毒，大立毛泽东思想。战无不胜的毛泽东思想是破私立公的最强大的武器。在工厂，在农村，在学校，在机关，首都的无产阶级革命派，到处都在一遍又一遍地学习毛主席“老三篇”，学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《整顿党的作风》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，一边战斗，一边整风，在斗争中掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。他们用毛主席的教导，检查自己的思想，衡量自己的行动。
    首都无产阶级革命派牢牢记住了毛主席的教导：实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己。他们认真地学习这一教导中的伟大的战略思想，领悟到无产阶级革命派是为了一个共同的革命目标走到一起来的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是革命派共同的敌人。决不能让“私”字在自己头脑里作怪，不能妨碍了革命派的大联合、大团结。要大反特反无政府主义，巩固和发展无产阶级革命派的大联合、大团结，集中一切力量，打击共同的敌人。他们认为，在革命派队伍中出现的包括无政府主义在内的各种错误思想的总根子就是“私”字，而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派就是“私”字的疯狂鼓吹者。这个人的欺人之谈的《修养》，绝口不谈无产阶级专政，实则鼓吹资产阶级专政，罪恶地宣扬腐朽的资产阶级世界观，就是要人“修养”成满脑子“私”字的极端的个人主义者和政治野心家，和平演变成修正主义。首都的无产阶级革命派认清了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶面目，他们就和全国亿万革命群众一起，对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对他提出的资产阶级反动路线和他所炮制的大毒草《修养》，展开了革命的大批判。大批判更加推进了大联合，无产阶级革命派更加紧密地团结起来，联合起来。革命派丢掉的只是那些小资产阶级、资产阶级的肮脏东西，而赢得的是无产阶级革命派的大联合。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”首都无产阶级革命派在庆贺北京市无产阶级革命派大联合、大团结、大会师的日子里，牢记着伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导。他们说，联合起来，是为了更好地战斗。联合起来，只是战斗的开始，只是万里长征的第一步。他们在胜利面前清楚地看到：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，
  “他们还要作最后的挣扎”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派还会用各种方式，包括利用革命队伍里的旧的习惯势力，来破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，妄图进行资本主义复辟。斗争总是有反复的，有曲折的，斗争还在继续。无产阶级革命派大联合的道路，也不会是笔直的。巩固和发展无产阶级革命派的大联合，前面还有新的斗争。但是不论阶级敌人怎样挣扎，怎样破坏，历史的车轮是挡不住的。
    展望未来，任重而道远。首都无产阶级革命派豪迈地说，我们一定永远站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗和革命的批判旗帜，更紧密地团结起来，联合起来，投入到当前正在开展的这场大批判的斗争中去，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他庇护下的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底打倒！
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，让我们用更加英勇的战斗，去迎接无产阶级文化大革命的更加伟大的胜利吧！
