A new and great battle has begun amidst the victorious songs of the proletarian revolutionary masses seizing power.

The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country have risen up with mighty force, using their pens as swords and spears, to launch a fierce general assault on the top capitalist-roader in the Party, criticizing his bourgeois reactionary line and the poisonous weed he authored, "Self-Cultivation."

The articles "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Personnel Issue Must Be Criticized" and "‘Strike Down a Big Patch, Protect a Small Clump’ Is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," published in the Red Flag magazine, as well as Comrade Chen Boda's "Patriotism or Treason?" have sounded the charge for this great battle.

As early as last May, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have already been exposed by us, some have not, and some are being cultivated by us as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchov. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of the Party committee must pay full attention to this point. The top capitalist-roader in the Party is such a Khrushchov-like figure."

To thoroughly criticize and expose the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the bourgeois reactionary line, and to strike a fatal blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, we must promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," advance the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power, and smash the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism, bringing new victories to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Currently, the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power is at a decisive stage. Our criticism of the top capitalist-roader in the Party should focus on his bourgeois reactionary line on personnel issues, criticizing the component of this reactionary line, "strike down a big patch, protect a small clump," and thoroughly eliminate its poisonous influence, liberating a large number of revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party have always been diametrically opposed on the issue of cadres. The Twenty-Three Articles and the Sixteen Articles, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, clearly point out: most cadres are good or relatively good; we should gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the cadres; for those who have made mistakes, we should implement the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient"; the focus should be on striking down the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, together with another major capitalist-roader in power, put forward the bourgeois reactionary line, doing the opposite. They labeled a large number of revolutionary cadres as "black gangs" and "anti-Party elements," vigorously obstructing the cadres from revolting, causing a serious confrontation between cadres and the masses. This situation is still greatly hindering the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and disrupting the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries to seize power today.

In this great struggle of criticism, cadres who have been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line should bravely stand up and revolt. Cadres who have executed the wrong line should immediately draw a clear line of demarcation with the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and with the bourgeois reactionary line. All cadres who want to revolt must firmly support the broad revolutionary masses and, together with them, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike down a big patch, protect a small clump," concentrating firepower to expose and strike down the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the top capitalist-roader in the Party who supports them from behind. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is formed in the great storms of class struggle. The revolutionary cadres who participate in the "three-in-one combination" are tempered in the surging tide of the mass movement.

Our criticism of the top capitalist-roader in the Party must be closely linked with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various regions, departments, and units. Over the past seventeen years, it is this Chinese Khrushchov who, in the fields of literature, history, philosophy, political economy, education, journalism, and in the Party, government, army, industry, agriculture, commerce, and academia, has fostered and protected a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and a handful of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," spreading a large amount of revisionist poison. At critical moments, these ghosts and snakes, under the instigation of their backstage bosses, will swarm out, launching ferocious attacks on the Party. The handful of big and small capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the various bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" are the mainstay of this Chinese Khrushchov's implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. It must be seen that the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses concentrating their firepower to struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in their own regions, departments, and units is to cut off the black hands of the top capitalist-roader in the Party extending into various fields; while thoroughly criticizing the top capitalist-roader in the Party will surely elevate the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units to a higher level.

Our criticism of the top capitalist-roader in the Party must thoroughly settle accounts with the bourgeois reactionary line represented by him over the past seventeen years.

Over the past seventeen years, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in a dominant position within the Party. It is like a red thread running through the history since the founding of the nation. Under the guidance of this revolutionary line, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved one great victory after another.

However, we must be soberly aware that the struggle between the two lines within the Party has been long-standing and unabated. Over the past seventeen years, one line represented by Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionaries, and another line represented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the bourgeois reactionaries, have been engaged in sharp and complex struggles within the Party. The focus of this struggle between the two lines is the question of which road China should take.

The proletarian revolutionaries led by Chairman Mao represent the fundamental interests of the broad laboring people of China and the revolutionary people of the world, firmly guiding the Chinese people to take the socialist road.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, where should China go? To capitalism or to socialism? ... The facts have answered this question: only socialism can save China."

The top capitalist-roader in the Party represents the interests of the Chinese bourgeoisie, adapts to the needs of imperialism and all reactionaries, and goes against Chairman Mao's teachings, attempting to achieve a great historical retrogression in China. It is this person who cheers for the exploitation of capitalists, praises the economy of rich peasants. It is this person who opposes the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce proposed by Chairman Mao, vigorously advocates the "four freedoms." It is this person who propagates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," advocates class reconciliation. It is this person who opposes the general line, people's communes, and the Great Leap Forward, vigorously advocates the "three harmonies and one reduction" and the "three selfs and one package." It is this person who implements the opportunist line of "left" in form but right in essence during the socialist education movement. It is this person who clears the way for the ferocious attacks launched by the reactionary bourgeoisie in the political, economic, cultural, and educational fields against the proletariat. This person's ambition is to develop capitalism in China and achieve the restoration of capitalism, that is, to drag China back to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism.

Therefore, thoroughly criticizing and settling accounts with the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party over the past seventeen years is a combat mission facing the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary people.

The struggle between the two lines in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a continuation and development of the struggle between the two lines over the past seventeen years. Only by thoroughly criticizing and settling accounts with the bourgeois reactionary line and its poisonous influence in various fields over the past seventeen years can the broad revolutionary masses understand the sharpness, necessity, and arduousness of the struggle between the two lines, draw lessons from it, and more consciously adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In criticizing the top capitalist-roader in the Party, we must deeply criticize his deceitful book, "Self-Cultivation." This book is the theoretical and ideological foundation of his implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. The criticism of this book is an important part of the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

This book completely divorces itself from the reality of class struggle, revolution, and political struggle, and does not mention that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. This book advocates the "cultivation" of the bourgeoisie and opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat. This book propagates idealism, advocates bourgeois individualism, and advocates slavery. This book is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. According to this book, comfortably staying in a small room to "cultivate oneself" can only comfortably turn into revisionism. This book, once published and reprinted, not only poisoned the entire Party and the nation but even poisoned the world, causing great harm. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some cadres, deceived and poisoned by "Self-Cultivation," hindered their active participation in the revolutionary mass movement and blindly executed the bourgeois reactionary line.

Comrades who have been deceived and poisoned should no longer be fooled by this book. They must wholeheartedly throw themselves into the fiery struggle of the mass movement, face the wind and rain, gain experience, temper themselves, and reform themselves. The thorough criticism of this book must be linked to one's own thoughts, touching the depths of the soul, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois worldview, and shattering the spiritual shackles that the top capitalist-roader in the Party has placed on oneself. This is a revolution to break private interests and establish public interests, a revolution to defeat bourgeois and all exploitative class thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought. Only by smashing this spiritual shackle can one march forward lightly and truly break with the bourgeois reactionary line, standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There must be comparison to have distinction. There must be distinction and struggle to have development. Truth is developed in the struggle against falsehood. Marxism is developed in this way. Marxism is developed in the struggle against the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie and can only be developed in struggle."

This great mass movement of criticism is a revolution to smash bourgeois thoughts and establish Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of criticizing this top capitalist-roader in the Party and the revisionist poison spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the hundreds of millions of people will surely be able to better grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, this weapon of struggle, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high!

    高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜
    在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的凯歌声中，一个新的伟大战役开始了。
    我国亿万革命群众，奋起千钧棒，以笔作刀枪，对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发起了猛烈的总攻击，对他所提出的资产阶级反动路线，对他所著的大毒草《修养》，展开了革命的大批判。
    《红旗》杂志发表的《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》，以及戚本禹同志所写的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》等三篇文章，吹响了这次伟大战役的进军号。
    早在去年五月，毛主席就指出：混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样的赫鲁晓夫式的人物。
    把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把资产阶级反动路线，批倒、批深、批臭，就必将给予党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以致命的打击，促进无产阶级革命派大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，推动无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，推动粉碎资本主义反革命复辟逆流的斗争，必将带来无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
    当前，无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，正处在决战阶段。我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，要着重批判他在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个反动路线的组成部分，彻底肃清它的流毒，把大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的革命干部解放出来。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在干部问题上，从来是针锋相对的。毛主席亲自主持制定的二十三条和十六条都明确指出：大多数干部是好的和比较好的；要逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部；对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策；重点是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伙同另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，抛出了资产阶级反动路线，反其道而行之。他们把大批革命干部打成“黑帮”、“反党分子”，竭力阻挡干部起来革命，使干部和群众的关系严重对立。这种情况，今天还在极大地妨碍革命的“三结合”，破坏无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    在这场伟大的批判斗争中，受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部，要勇敢地站出来革命。执行过错误路线的干部，要立即和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，和资产阶级反动路线划清界限。一切要革命的干部，都要坚决支持广大革命群众，和他们一起彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，集中火力揭露和打击一小撮反革命修正主义分子和背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。革命的“三结合”，是在阶级斗争的大风大浪里形成的。参加“三结合”的革命干部，是在汹涌澎湃的群众运动洪流中考验出来的。
    我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一定要同各地区、各部门、各单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来。十七年来，正是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在文学、史学、哲学、政治经济学、教育学、新闻学等各个领域，在党、政、军、工、农、商、学各界，扶植和保护了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮资产阶级反动学术“权威”，散布了大量的修正主义毒素。在关键时刻，这些牛鬼蛇神总要在他们的后台老板鼓动下，纷纷出笼，跳出来向党发动猖狂进攻。而党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮形形色色的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，正是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的基干力量。一定要看到，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众集中火力斗争本地区、本部门、本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是斩断党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伸向各个领域的黑手；而彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，又必将把各单位的斗、批、改提到更高的水平。
    我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，必须彻底清算十七年来以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线。
    十七年来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在党内占据着统治地位。它象一条红线，贯穿在建国以来的历史中。在这条革命路线的指引下，我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。
    但是，必须清醒地认识，党内两条路线的斗争由来已久，从未间断。十七年来，一条以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，一条以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在党内进行着尖锐复杂的斗争。这两条路线斗争的焦点，是中国走什么道路的问题。
    以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命派，代表中国广大劳动人民和世界革命人民的根本利益，坚定地引导中国人民走社会主义道路。
    毛主席指出：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？……事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，代表中国资产阶级的利益，适应帝国主义和一切反动派的需要，同毛主席的教导唱反调，妄图实现中国历史的大倒退。就是这个人，为资本家剥削喝采，为富农经济叫好。就是这个人，反对毛主席提出的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，拚命鼓吹“四大自由”。就是这个人，宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，主张阶级调和。就是这个人，反对总路线、人民公社、大跃进，竭力鼓吹“三和一少”、“三自一包”。就是这个人，在社会主义教育运动中推行形“左”实右的机会主义路线。就是这个人，为反动的资产阶级在政治、经济、文化、教育等各个领域内向无产阶级发动的猖狂进攻，鸣锣开道。这个人的野心，是要在中国发展资本主义和实现资本主义复辟，也就是要把中国拉回到半封建半殖民地的老路上去。
    因此，彻底批判和清算十七年来以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，是摆在无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民面前的一个战斗任务。
    目前无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线的斗争，就是十七年来两条路线斗争的继续和发展。只有彻底批判和清算十七年来的资产阶级反动路线及其在各个领域内的流毒，才能使广大革命群众懂得两条路线斗争的尖锐性、必要性和艰巨性，从中吸取经验教训，更自觉地坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，特别要深入批判他的欺人之谈的《修养》。这本书，是他推行资产阶级反动路线的理论基础和思想基础。对《修养》这本书的批判，是批判资产阶级反动路线的一个重要内容。
    《修养》这本书，完全脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题。这本书，是要资产阶级“修养”，不要无产阶级专政。这本书，宣扬唯心主义，提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义。这本书，是反马克思列宁主义，反毛泽东思想的。按照这本书，舒舒服服地关在小屋子里去“修身养性”，就只能是舒舒服服地演变成修正主义。这本书一版再版，不仅流毒全党全国，甚至流毒世界，害人不浅。在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些干部由于受了《修养》的骗，中了《修养》的毒，妨碍他们积极投身于革命的群众运动，盲目地执行了资产阶级反动路线。
    受蒙蔽、受毒害的同志，不要再上《修养》这本书的当了。一定要全身心地投入群众运动的火热斗争中去，经风雨，见世面，在斗争中考验自己，锻炼自己，改造自己。对这本书的彻底批判，一定要联系自己的思想，触及灵魂的深处，大破资产阶级的世界观，粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派套在自己身上的精神枷锁。这是一场破私立公的革命，是用毛泽东思想战胜资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想的革命。只有打碎这个精神枷锁，才能轻装前进，真正同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    毛主席教导我们：“有比较才能鉴别。有鉴别，有斗争，才能发展。真理是在同谬误作斗争中间发展起来的。马克思主义就是这样发展起来的。马克思主义在同资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想作斗争中发展起来，而且只有在斗争中才能发展起来。”
    这一场伟大的群众性的批判运动，就是一场大破资产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想的革命群众运动。亿万群众在批判这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的过程中，在批判反革命修正主义分子所散布的修正主义毒素的过程中，一定能够更好地掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个战斗的武器，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新高潮！
