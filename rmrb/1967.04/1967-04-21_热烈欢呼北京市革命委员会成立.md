In the unprecedented storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the new high tide of the mass movement to thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and under the loving care and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established!

This is a new triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, a great victory of great significance in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary forces in our country! We must cherish this victory. Let us cheer this victory, celebrate this victory, consolidate this victory, and develop this victory!

The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing have displayed revolutionary pioneering spirit. After relatively thorough preparation and deliberation, they have respectively convened meetings of revolutionary worker representatives, poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, and red guards from institutions of higher learning and secondary schools, achieving a great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the city. With the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, they have established a truly revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—according to Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Beijing is the location of the highest command of the proletarian revolution in our country, and it is the beacon of hope and liberation for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Our great proletarian revolutionary leader Chairman Mao leads the socialist revolution and socialist construction of China from here. The revolutionary people of the capital, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to build Beijing into a red fortress of proletarian dictatorship and socialism.

However, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, under the direct command and support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, have done everything in their power to turn Beijing into a base for restoring capitalism nationwide.

If the proletariat does not resolutely smash the plots of these revisionists, then, as Chairman Mao has pointed out, "...it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, the Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

The dark clouds cannot obscure the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Beijing, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have, over the past seventeen years, adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the socialist road, and have been waging a resolute struggle against this gang of revisionists.

"In June, the heavenly troops march to exterminate evil, and a ten-thousand-foot rope is needed to bind the rocs." Under the personal initiation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, a magnificent and roaring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in Beijing.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing, with an irresistible momentum, have overthrown the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The Party Central Committee, with Chairman Mao at its helm, has dismissed these revisionists from their posts and removed them from their positions.

Beijing is the center and source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every battle here influences the progress of the movement nationwide. The proletarian revolutionary forces of the capital, remembering Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing posted the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism nationwide, firing the first shot of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing initiated the world-shaking Red Guard movement, with great revolutionary daring, sweeping away all the filth of the exploiting classes. The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing rose up to criticize the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their reactionary bourgeois line, to criticize the reactionary bourgeois line executed by the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and to repel the repeated frenzied counterattacks of the reactionary bourgeois line, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

All these achievements of the proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing have been gained under the loving care and direct guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao.

"People, and people alone, are the motive force of history." The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing tells us that as long as we firmly trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, we will definitely be able to surmount any obstacles, defeat all enemies, and push history forward.

Beijing is advancing, China is advancing, the revolution is advancing.

Before us is a great situation. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victory. However, the class enemies are still attempting to resist stubbornly. There are still various problems within our own ranks. The struggle will encounter twists and turns, our road is still long, and our tasks are still heavy.

At present, in the stage of the united seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary forces, the fighting tasks facing the people of Beijing and the whole country are to hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly criticize politically, ideologically, and theoretically the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line they proposed and insisted on, along with that big poisonous weed "On Practice." We must, with the criticism of the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party as the center, combine the criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in various provinces, municipalities, regions, departments, and units, and also combine the criticism of the reactionary academic "authorities" in various fields, and gradually enter the stage of struggle, criticism, and reform in various units according to different situations.

In the great criticism of the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must fight and rectify our ranks, overcoming all non-proletarian thoughts. At present, we must especially oppose anarchist thoughts and further strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. We must actively respond to the call to support the army and love the people. In the struggle, we must consolidate and expand the great alliance of revolutionaries, consolidate and strengthen the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In the great criticism of the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to conduct great criticism, and in the great criticism, further understand and master Mao Zedong Thought.

After being tempered by the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian dictatorship of our country will be more consolidated and more powerful.

"Let the internal and external reactionaries tremble before us, let them say whatever they want about us, the unyielding efforts of the Chinese people will surely achieve their goals step by step."

    热烈欢呼北京市革命委员会成立
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命风暴中，在彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动新高潮中，在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀和指导下，北京市革命委员会宣告成立了！
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的一个新凯歌！
    这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是我国无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中具有重大意义的伟大胜利！我们要珍惜这个胜利。让我们欢呼这个胜利，庆祝这个胜利，巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利！
    北京的无产阶级革命派，发扬了革命的首创精神，经过比较充分的准备和酝酿，分别召开了革命职工代表会议，贫下中农代表会议，大专院校红卫兵代表大会，和中等学校红卫兵代表大会，实现了全市无产阶级革命派大联合。在强大的中国人民解放军的支持和帮助下，按照毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，建立了真正革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会。
    北京，是我国无产阶级革命最高司令部的所在地，是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民解放的希望和灯塔。伟大的无产阶级革命导师毛主席就在这里领导着中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设。用毛泽东思想武装起来的首都革命人民，坚定地要把北京建设成为无产阶级专政的社会主义的红色堡垒。
    但是，旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的直接指挥和支持下，却千方百计地要把北京变成在全国复辟资本主义的一个基地。
    如果无产阶级不坚决粉碎这些修正主义分子的阴谋，那就要象毛主席所指出的：“……不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    乌云遮不住毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光。具有光荣革命传统的北京市广大革命群众和革命干部，十七年来，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚持社会主义道路，对这一伙修正主义分子，一直进行着坚决的斗争。
      “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导下，一场气势磅礴、轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命从北京开始了。
    北京市无产阶级革命派，以排山倒海之势，打倒了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团。以毛主席为首的党中央罢了这些修正主义分子的官，撤了他们的职。
    北京，是无产阶级文化大革命的中心和发源地。这里的每一场战斗，都影响着全国运动的进程。首都无产阶级革命派，牢记毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，为全国无产阶级文化大革命作出了伟大的贡献。
    北京的无产阶级革命派，贴出了全国第一张马列主义的大字报，打响了无产阶级文化大革命的第一声号炮。北京的无产阶级革命派，发起了震动世界的红卫兵运动，以大无畏的革命造反精神，荡涤一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水。北京的无产阶级革命派，奋起批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们制定的资产阶级反动路线，批判北京新市委执行的资产阶级反动路线，击退了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的猖狂反扑，掀起了一个革命的大批判新高潮。
    北京市无产阶级革命派所有这一切成就，都是在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和直接指导下获得的。
      “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”北京市无产阶级文化大革命的实践告诉我们，只要我们坚定地信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，我们就一定能够超越任何障碍，战胜一切敌人，推动历史向前发展。
    北京在前进，中国在前进，革命在前进。
    在我们面前，是一派大好形势。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是，阶级敌人还在妄图顽抗。我们自己的队伍中也还存在着这样的那样的问题。斗争还会出现曲折，我们的道路还是长的，任务还很重。
    当前，在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的这个阶段中，摆在北京和全国人民面前的战斗任务，就是要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及他们提出和坚持的资产阶级反动路线，连同那本大毒草《修养》，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透，批倒、批臭。我们一定要以批判党内最大的少数走资本主义道路的当权派为中心，结合批判各省市、各地区、各部门、各单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，还要结合批判各个领域里的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，按照不同的情况，逐步地进入各单位的斗批改。
    我们要在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，边战斗，边整风，克服自己队伍中一切非无产阶级思想。在当前，特别要反对无政府主义思想，进一步加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。我们要积极响应拥军爱民的号召。在斗争中，巩固和扩大革命的大联合，巩固和加强革命的“三结合”。
    我们要在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器进行大批判，在大批判中进一步领会和掌握毛泽东思想。
    经历了无产阶级文化大革命急风暴雨的洗炼，我国的无产阶级政权，将更加巩固，更加强大。
      “让那些内外反动派在我们面前发抖罢，让他们去说我们这也不行那也不行罢，中国人民的不屈不挠的努力必将稳步地达到自己的目的。”
