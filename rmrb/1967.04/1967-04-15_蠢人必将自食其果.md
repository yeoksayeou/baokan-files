Recently, the reactionary regime in Indonesia has launched a new wave of anti-Chinese sentiment. Amidst this violent wave, the broad masses of Chinese Indonesians, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a courageous struggle of resistance. This just action is excellent! We, the people of China, firmly support you and salute you!

The right-wing military regime in Indonesia has intensified its persecution of Chinese Indonesians in order to divert the attention of the Indonesian people, to strengthen its fascist rule, and to curry favor with and collude with their two masters, American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. This despicable purpose is quite obvious.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries have made the broad masses of Chinese Indonesians intolerable. Thus, they resist and struggle. The Chinese Indonesian compatriot Huang Jianmin in the city of Sidoarjo, East Java, was shot dead by Indonesian fascist bandits! One Huang Jianmin falls, thousands of Huang Jianmins stand up. The broad masses of Chinese Indonesians, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are unyielding, fearless, and indomitable. "For the sake of sacrifice, many are resolved," the blood of the martyrs inspires the broad masses of Chinese Indonesians in their struggle against persecution, strengthens the confidence of the Indonesian people in resisting fascist tyranny, and further enhances the combat unity between the broad masses of Chinese Indonesians and the Indonesian people.

With a powerful motherland and 700 million compatriots as their backing, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and with the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the Indonesian people, the just struggle of the Chinese Indonesians is bound to achieve final victory. While a handful of Indonesian reactionaries who rely on bloody massacres to maintain their rule are precisely the kind of "fools who lift a stone only to drop it on their own feet" as Chairman Mao said, they will surely reap what they sow.

    蠢人必将自食其果
    最近，印尼反动当局又掀起了新的排华浪潮。在这股狂暴的浪潮中，印尼广大华侨，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，展开了英勇的反抗斗争。这种正义的行动好得很！我们国内人民坚决支持你们，向你们致敬！
    印尼右派军人政权变本加厉地迫害华侨，是为了转移印尼人民的视线，是为了加强它的法西斯统治，是为了讨好和勾结他们的两个主子美帝和苏修。这种卑鄙的目的，是十分明显的。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。印尼反动派的法西斯暴行，使得广大华侨忍无可忍。于是，就反抗，就斗争。印尼东爪哇西都文罗市侨胞黄健民被印尼法西斯匪徒枪杀了！一个黄健民倒下去，千百个黄健民站起来。用毛泽东思想武装起来的印尼广大华侨是压不服，吓不倒，杀不绝的。“为有牺牲多壮志”，烈士的鲜血，鼓舞了广大华侨反迫害的斗志，增强了印尼人民反抗法西斯暴政的信心，同时，也进一步加强了广大华侨和印尼人民之间的战斗的团结。
    有强大的祖国和七亿同胞作后盾，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，有广大印尼人民的同情和支持，印尼华侨的正义斗争，是一定会取得最后胜利的。而一小撮依靠血腥屠杀维持统治的印尼反动派，正是毛主席所说的那种“搬起石头打自己的脚”的蠢人，他们一定要自食其果。
