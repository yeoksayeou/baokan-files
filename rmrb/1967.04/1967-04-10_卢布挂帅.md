Title: The Ruble Takes Command

The Soviet revisionist leadership is hastily pushing their so-called "new system" in various sectors of the Soviet national economy. The core of this "new system" is the ruble taking command, pursuing profits, and making the profit principle the highest principle for all economic activities.

This is a treacherous step taken by the Soviet revisionist clique using the state power they have usurped to thoroughly destroy the socialist economic foundation, thoroughly bury the fruits of the October Revolution, and thoroughly restore capitalism.

Chasing profits is the absolute law of capitalism. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is bringing this over and treating it as the golden rule, using profit as the basic motive force for production, allowing enterprises to adjust production according to market conditions, and replacing planned economy with free competition. They are clearly implementing capitalism, yet they boast about it as a "new creation" to "strengthen and develop socialism." They truly do not know the meaning of shame!

Not only that, the Soviet revisionist clique is fervently implementing the profit principle in all aspects of domestic life in the Soviet Union. Whether it is literature and art, school education, or scientific research, the ruble takes command everywhere. It is no wonder that even the official publications of the Soviet revisionists cannot hide the fact that "ruble, ruble, money, business... you see and hear only these words in the newspapers and on the radio."

Engels once said: "In the eyes of the bourgeoisie, nothing in the world exists that is not for money, including themselves, because they live only to make money, and apart from getting rich quickly, they know of no other happiness..." This is the best description of the Soviet revisionist clique and the Soviet bourgeois privileged stratum they represent.

The Soviet revisionist clique's treacherous activities of fully restoring capitalism have been loudly applauded by imperialism. Last spring, when the Soviet revisionist clique began to implement this "new system," the American *Wall Street Journal* cheered for them learning from capitalism, welcoming them to "join our club." Now, the Soviet revisionist clique has even more qualifications to join the club of monopoly capitalists, merging with imperialism.

    卢布挂帅
    苏修领导集团正在苏联国民经济各部门，加紧推行他们的所谓“新体制”。这个“新体制”的核心，就是卢布挂帅，就是唯利是图，就是把利润原则作为一切经济活动的最高原则。
    这是苏修叛徒利用他们所篡夺的国家权力，彻底破坏社会主义经济基础，彻底葬送十月革命成果，彻底复辟资本主义的罪恶步骤。
    追逐利润是资本主义的绝对法则。现在，苏修集团把这一套搬过来奉为金科玉律，以利润作为生产的基本动力，让企业按市场行情调节生产，用自由竞争代替计划经济。他们明明搞的是资本主义，居然吹嘘是什么“加强和发展社会主义”的“新创造”。真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    不仅如此，苏修集团正在狂热地把利润原则贯彻到苏联国内生活的一切领域。诸如文学艺术、学校教育、科学研究各部门，无一不是卢布挂帅。无怪乎苏修官方刊物也不能掩饰，“卢布，卢布，金钱，生意……你从报上看到和从无线电里听到的只是这些字眼。”
    恩格斯说过：“在资产阶级看来，世界上没有一样东西不是为了金钱而存在的，连他们本身也不例外，因为他们活着就是为了赚钱，除了快快发财，他们不知道还有别的幸福……。”这也就是对苏修集团及其所代表的苏联资产阶级特权阶层的最好的写照。
    苏修集团全面复辟资本主义的背叛活动，博得了帝国主义大声喝采。去年春天，当苏修集团着手推行这套“新体制”的时候，美国的《华尔街日报》就为他们向资本主义“学样”叫好，向他们表示“欢迎加入我们的俱乐部”。如今，苏修集团更有资格加入垄断资本集团的“俱乐部”，同帝国主义合二而一了。
