The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great joy for the revolutionary people of Beijing, a great joy for the people of the whole nation, and a great event that shakes the world and is welcomed by revolutionary people of various countries.

For many years, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, under the support and protection of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, viciously attacked and slandered our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They implemented a strict blockade against Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, turning Beijing into an "independent kingdom." They waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, appearing human on the surface but being ghosts in reality, committing the evil deeds of usurping the Party, the army, and the government right under Chairman Mao's nose.

Under the direct leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing have risen up with the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the old municipal committee, and overthrown the reactionary rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. Now, a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born, and we enthusiastically celebrate this great victory!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." In the future, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end for the realization of socialism and communism.

Currently, the combat mission of our Red Guards is to closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly support the correct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, and together with hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and thoroughly eliminate their pernicious influence in various units. Our Red Guards must achieve great unity in the great criticism of the revolution, organize a vast army of cultural revolution, and move on to the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Our Red Guards must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call: "Resume classes and make revolution," study while fighting, and carry out rectification. In the rectification, we must strongly oppose and criticize anarchism, overthrow factionalism, individualism, sectarianism, and regionalism.

Our Red Guards must resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new height.

We, the Red Guards of the capital, feel limitless happiness and great honor in living by the side of Chairman Mao. We will not disappoint the great expectations of our great leader and the revolutionary people, and we are determined to forever maintain revolutionary vigor and forever follow Chairman Mao forward in the great storms!

    全国人民的大喜事
    北京市革命委员会的成立，是我们北京革命人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，是全国人民的一件大喜事，也是一件震撼世界的、受到各国革命人民欢迎的大喜事。
    多年来，旧北京市委、市人民委员会一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派支持、包庇下，恶毒地攻击和诬蔑我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想。他们对毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央实行严密封锁，把北京变成为一个“独立王国”。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，明里是人，暗中是鬼，就在毛主席身边，干着篡党、篡军、篡政的罪恶勾当。
    我们北京市的无产阶级革命派，在伟大领袖毛主席的直接领导下，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸烂了旧市委，推翻了反革命修正主义集团的反动统治。现在，一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的北京市革命委员会诞生了，我们热烈地欢呼这个伟大的胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬不断革命、彻底革命的精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为实现社会主义、共产主义而奋斗。
    目前，我们红卫兵的战斗任务，就是紧紧跟着伟大领袖毛主席，就是坚决拥护高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中央文革小组的正确领导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，和亿万工农群众一起，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，彻底肃清他们在各单位的恶劣影响。我们红卫兵一定要在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，组织起浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，转入斗批改。
    我们红卫兵要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召：“复课闹革命”，一边上课，一边战斗，一边整风。在整风中要大反特反无政府主义，打倒小团体主义、个人主义、宗派主义和山头主义。
    我们红卫兵要坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新水平。
    我们首都的红卫兵以生活在毛主席身边而感到无限幸福、无比光荣。我们决不辜负伟大领袖和革命人民对我们的无限期望，决心永远保持革命的朝气，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪里前进！
