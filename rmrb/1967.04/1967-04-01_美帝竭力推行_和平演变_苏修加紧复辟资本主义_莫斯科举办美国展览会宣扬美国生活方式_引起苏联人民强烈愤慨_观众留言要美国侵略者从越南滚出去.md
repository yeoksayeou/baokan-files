The U.S. Empire Strives to Implement "Peaceful Evolution" While Soviet Revisionists Rush to Restore Capitalism

Moscow Hosts American Exhibition to Promote American Way of Life

Causes Strong Indignation Among Soviet People; Audience Leaves Messages Demanding U.S. Aggressors Get Out of Vietnam

	NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) — Just as the U.S. imperialists are frantically escalating their war of aggression in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership invited the Johnson administration to hold a grand "American—Industrial Aesthetics" exhibition in Moscow to further strengthen "Sino-American cooperation."

	This American exhibition, which ran from February 26 to March 29, extensively promoted the "material civilization" and "way of life" of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, who have built their wealth through aggression, plunder, oppression, and exploitation. The exhibition displayed new types of cars for American big capitalists, refrigerators, various electrical appliances, and cosmetics. At the entrance of the exhibition, there was a sign with a personal inscription from the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson. Johnson wrote that this was the ninth American exhibition held in the Soviet Union in recent years. This head of the American bandits shamelessly declared that the U.S. authorities and the Soviet revisionist leadership "share the desire to improve the lives of people around the world." He further stated that activities like this exhibition would help us exchange experiences and better understand each other. The U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union personally attended the opening ceremony of this exhibition, enthusiastically promoting and praising "Sino-American cooperation." The U.S. government also selected several carefully groomed "American girls" to greet visitors with "peaceful smiles" accompanied by jazz music, distributing thick "explanatory booklets" that boasted about American "material civilization" and "way of life," which included Johnson's inscription and signature.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership was extremely enthusiastic and attentive in serving the American exhibition. They arranged this exhibition in one of the largest parks in Moscow, Sokolniki Park, in an exhibition hall. During the exhibition period, Soviet newspapers ran large advertisements for the exhibition and dispatched Soviet police to maintain order.

	The strong interest shown by both the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists in this exhibition is not coincidental. The Johnson administration, on the one hand, aims to lure the Soviet revisionists to more actively serve as the chief accomplice in extinguishing the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. On the other hand, it seeks to promote capitalist "civilization" and "aesthetics" to the Soviet revisionists, helping them implement "peaceful evolution" at home. Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionist leadership, which pursues "Sino-American cooperation" to dominate the world and fully implements the restoration of capitalism at home, is more than willing to accept these.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership's enthusiastic assistance to the Johnson administration in holding this American exhibition in Moscow has sparked strong indignation among the Soviet people. Some visitors angrily wrote in the exhibition's guestbook: "The U.S. government is continuing its bloody war in Vietnam; you should go home!"

	This American exhibition held in Moscow is just a small episode in the current "Sino-American cooperation," but it clearly reveals the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership in collaborating with U.S. imperialism and betraying the interests of the Soviet and world peoples.

    美帝竭力推行“和平演变”　苏修加紧复辟资本主义
    莫斯科举办美国展览会宣扬美国生活方式
    引起苏联人民强烈愤慨　观众留言要美国侵略者从越南滚出去
    新华社莫斯科三十日电　正当美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵越战争的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团邀请约翰逊政府在莫斯科大张旗鼓地举办“美国—工业美学”展览会，来进一步加强“苏美合作”。
    这个从二月二十六日到三月二十九日举行的美国展览会，大肆宣扬靠侵略、掠夺、压迫和剥削起家的美国垄断资产阶级的“物质文明”和“生活方式”。展览会上展出的有供美国大资本家使用的新型汽车、电冰箱、各种电气生活用具和化妆品。展览会的入口处树立的牌子上，张贴着美帝国主义的头子约翰逊亲自签字的题词。约翰逊写道，这是近几年来“在苏联举办的第九个美国展览会”。这个美国强盗头子，还恬不知耻地公然宣称，美国当局和苏修领导集团“共同有着协力改善全世界人们的生活的愿望。类似这个展览会这样的活动，将有助于我们交流经验和更好增加相互了解。”美国驻苏联大使亲自出席了这个展览会的开幕式，大肆鼓吹和赞扬“美苏合作”。美国政府还挑选了若干经过精心打扮的“美国女郎”，在爵士乐曲的伴奏下用“和平的微笑”来招待参观者，散发吹嘘美国“物质文明”和“生活方式”的厚厚的
  “说明书”，其中并印有约翰逊的题词和签名。
    苏修领导集团对美国展览会是百般热心和殷勤地效劳。他们把这一展览会，安排在莫斯科最大的公园之一——索科尔尼基公园内的一座展览馆中，在展览会展出期间，苏联报刊为这个展览会大登广告，并派出苏联警察维持秩序。
    苏修和美帝对这次展览会都如此“感到兴趣”，绝不是偶然的。约翰逊政府一方面是为了拉拢苏修更积极地为它充当扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争烈火的头号帮凶，另一方面是为了向苏修推销资本主义的“文明”和“美学”，帮助苏修在国内搞“和平演变”。而在国际上一心追求“苏美合作主宰世界”，在国内全面推行复辟资本主义的苏修领导集团，对这些都是心甘情愿的。
    苏修领导集团极力协助约翰逊政府在莫斯科搞的这个美国展览会，引起苏联人民的强烈愤慨。有的观众愤怒地在美国展览会的留言簿上写道：“美国政府在越南继续进行血腥战争，你们应当滚回家！”
    这次在莫斯科举行的美国展览会，只是当前“苏美合作”中的一个小小插曲，但是也可以清楚地看出苏修领导集团投靠美帝，出卖苏联和世界人民利益的叛徒面目。
