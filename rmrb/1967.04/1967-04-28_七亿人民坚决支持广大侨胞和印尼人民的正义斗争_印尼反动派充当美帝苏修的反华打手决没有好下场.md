Ten thousand people in the capital solemnly held a rally today to strongly denounce and vehemently condemn the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, which have further sabotaged relations between the two countries.

The rally held by the revolutionary masses of the capital today is a rally of the Chinese people to the world to expose the crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto-Nasution. It is a rally to launch a fierce attack on the imperialists led by the United States and their accomplices and running dogs. It is a rally to firmly support the just struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

The rally expressed strong support for the statement issued by our government on the 26th, pointing out that the Indonesian reactionaries, acting as anti-China henchmen for the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, will meet a bad end. The rally warned the Indonesian reactionaries that the Chinese people are a great people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Republic of China is a great country of proletarian dictatorship as firm as a rock. The 700 million Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian reactionaries will ultimately escape their doom if they persist in their course.

The rally paid tribute to the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and bravely fighting against the Indonesian reactionaries. It praised their struggle against persecution, which is just and good, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people while greatly undermining the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries. The rally expressed that the 700 million people of the motherland will be a strong backing for the broad masses of overseas Chinese, and their just struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and responsible officials from relevant departments such as Liao Chengzhi, Su Yu, Han Nianlong, Nie Yuanzi, Ding Guoyu, representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards from the capital, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese attended the rally. Those who attended the rally also included Zhao Xiaoshou, who had protected the five-starred red flag with his blood in Jakarta and fought bravely against the Indonesian reactionaries, representatives of the heroic collective of 41 returned overseas Chinese youth who had fought unyieldingly against U.S. imperialists and Indonesian reactionaries in Medan, and relatives of Ning Xiangyu, an elderly overseas Chinese who was recently shot dead by the Indonesian reactionaries in Jakarta.

Revolutionary Indonesian friends in Beijing were invited to attend the rally. Among them were Cha Huaduo and his wife, Supeno and his wife, Isa and his wife, Wili and his wife, Sua'er, and Lasuduo.

The rally was held in the magnificent Workers' Stadium. The workers, commune members, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, Red Guard youngsters, and revolutionary cadres from various departments who attended the rally were filled with strong indignation against U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" "Firmly support the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese against persecution!" The atmosphere of the meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary fighting spirit.

After Nie Yuanzi, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, announced the beginning of the rally, the entire audience of 100,000 people sang "The East Is Red" and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Xie Fuzhi spoke first at the rally. (The full text is on the second page.) He said that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution, since they staged a counter-revolutionary coup and seized power, have brutally suppressed the people domestically and implemented fascist rule; externally, they have leaned on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and have been crazily anti-China and anti-Chinese. The heinous crimes committed by this small group of reactionaries against the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world are unforgivable and must be settled.

He said that over the past year, the Indonesian reactionary government has committed a series of anti-China atrocities. They have maliciously attacked and slandered our great motherland. They even dared to slander our most beloved leader, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao. This is a serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people and a serious provocation to the revolutionary people of the world. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. We must fight to the end with this small group of Indonesian reactionaries!

Xie Fuzhi pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government has been crazily persecuting hundreds of thousands of innocent overseas Chinese, and their methods are even more vicious than the atrocities of South African racism. Recently, they have once again directed their arrows at our embassy, even daring to expel our charg√© d'affaires and consul-general. He said that the increasingly rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary government show that they are determined to be enemies of the Chinese people and to completely sabotage relations between the two countries and the friendly unity of the two peoples. We must warn the Indonesian reactionaries: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Our patience has its limits. You will not have a good end if you persist in your reckless actions. Xie Fuzhi said that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto and Nasution is a running dog raised by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and is a clique that came to power through a counter-revolutionary coup with the support of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism. Since they came to power, they have openly served the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war in Southeast Asia, acting as anti-China henchmen for the U.S. and Soviet revisionism. They have implemented fascist rule domestically, carrying out unprecedented large-scale suppression, massacre, and arrest of the Indonesian people. Tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Indonesian people have been sacrificed under their butcher's knife, and tens of thousands of patriotic people have been subjected to cruel persecution in prisons. The Suharto-Nasution regime is the most reactionary, most decadent, and most brutal regime in Indonesian history.

Xie Fuzhi said that the broad masses of overseas Chinese in our country have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and have bravely fought against persecution, deprivation, and for survival. Their struggle is not only for the protection of their legitimate rights but also for the national dignity of the motherland and for the maintenance of revolutionary friendship between China and the Indonesian people. They are fighting justly and well.

Xie Fuzhi said that the Chinese people are heart to heart with the Indonesian people. We express deep sympathy and firm support for the Indonesian people who are struggling hard. The heroic Indonesian people are not to be intimidated or subdued. They will definitely smash the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Indonesia. Indonesia will definitely become a revolutionary Indonesia.

Wu Zhao'an, a representative of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said in his speech, "Our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong, the red sun in our hearts, the great savior of millions of patriotic overseas Chinese, Chairman Mao! We wish you eternal life! Eternal life! We wish our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the closest comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, good health! Eternal health!"

Wu Zhao'an said that we returned overseas Chinese are extremely indignant and strongly protest against the Indonesian reactionaries' deliberate sabotage of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia and their fascist atrocities against overseas Chinese. The Indonesian reactionaries' persecution of overseas Chinese is precisely to cater to the needs of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism in their joint anti-China efforts, to divert the target of the people's struggle at home, and to attempt to sever the ties between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, which is a futile attempt! The broad masses of laboring overseas Chinese who have settled in Indonesia for generations have already formed an indestructible fighting friendship with the Indonesian people. The broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people will forever stand together, fight together, and win together! The Indonesian reactionaries will definitely not escape their doom! We must solemnly warn the Indonesian government: blood debts must be repaid with blood! You think you can subdue the broad masses of overseas Chinese with fascist terror, which is just a pipe dream! The broad masses of overseas Chinese are indomitable, unbreakable, and unkillable!

Wu Zhao'an said that we returned overseas Chinese will always be heart to heart with the overseas Chinese in the struggle. As long as the overseas Chinese in Indonesia hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, final victory will definitely belong to the patriotic overseas Chinese who dare to struggle and dare to win. We returned overseas Chinese will always be heart to heart with the Indonesian people. The revolutionary people of Indonesia will definitely rise up against the reactionaries. The invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be planted all over Indonesia.

Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Wang Jingrui, Beijing Municipal Farmers' Congress, Luo Ruihua, People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing, Xu Henglu, representatives from the Red Guards of higher education institutions in the capital, Dai Baoyuan, and representatives from the Red Guards of middle schools in the capital, Li Dongmin, spoke successively at the rally. They expressed their firm support for the statement of our government and their firm support for the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese. They said that the invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought guides the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, and the struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese against persecution will definitely achieve final victory.

Wang Jingrui said that the invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly radiating its boundless power, guiding the revolutionary people of the world to rise up and rebel, making all reactionaries feel the threat of death. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sounded the death knell for imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Indonesian reactionaries are having a hysterical outburst and are making their last struggle, but in the face of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian reactionaries will only meet a shameful end of "making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing more, until they are destroyed."

Luo Ruihua said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the historical wheel, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably achieve victory." The Indonesian reactionary government's massacre of our overseas Chinese and sabotage of relations between the two countries only shows that they are a group of desperate, struggling beasts. Their days are numbered. The Indonesian reactionaries will definitely not escape the punishment of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

Xu Henglu said that the series of new anti-China crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries is part of the current anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are vigorously supporting the Indonesian reactionaries and cheering for their anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries are particularly eager to maliciously attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, all these evil activities will not save them from their doomed fate. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism colluding with the Indonesian reactionaries to jointly oppose China will inevitably start with the intention of harming others and end with the result of harming themselves.

Dai Baoyuan said that the eagerness of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries to oppose us shows that we are right and we are doing well! Under the banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, a great anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist army composed of the revolutionary people of the world and oppressed nations has already gathered. This revolutionary army will surely smash the old world, bury all systems of exploitation, eliminate all harmful creatures, and a new world illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be in our hands. He said that the armed struggle of the revolutionary people of Indonesia will ultimately bury the reactionary military regime of Indonesia. Indonesia is the Indonesia of the Indonesian people! The world will definitely belong to the people!

Li Dongmin said that the Indonesian reactionaries have launched a new and unprecedented wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, acting as the vanguard of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism in their anti-China efforts, reflecting that their class struggle at home is becoming increasingly sharp and their fascist rule is already in a precarious situation. The emergency "joint action" of the U.S., Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries in their anti-China farce once again shows that they are the true enemies of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia, the common enemies of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world. He said that we are the Red Guards of Chairman Mao. We hold high the banner of "Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified" and are making a big fuss against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. We will also make a big fuss against the U.S., Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries. We Red Guards are the strong backing of the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

Indonesian friend Cha Huaduo spoke at the rally (the full text is on the second page), strongly condemning the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime for its bloody suppression of the Indonesian people and its savage anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. He said that the Indonesian people and patriots not only hate and curse the Indonesian fascist military regime and its fascist behavior but also have the responsibility to take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and resolutely overthrow this regime.

Cha Huaduo said that the Indonesian people have found the way to smash this fascist clique, which is the road of people's war, the road of Mao Zedong. We express our deepest gratitude to the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao for their fraternal sympathy and support.

Cha Huaduo exposed the extremely brutal suppression of the Indonesian people by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. He said that they are more brutal than Hitler, who is cursed by the whole world. At present, this small group of fascist generals in power has already pawned our country to U.S. imperialism, and they are plotting to make the Indonesian people a cheap labor reserve force for imperialism. However, the Suharto-Nasution regime is acting as their watchdog.

Cha Huaduo said that under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, Indonesia has been included in the global strategy of imperialism led by the United States, and their main target is aimed at the strongest fortress of anti-imperialist struggle in the world‚ÄîChina. The policy of the Indonesian fascist regime is to serve imperialism and oppose China.

Cha Huaduo strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionist group for continuously providing economic and military aid to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and actively spreading modern revisionist thoughts to split the revolutionary ranks of Indonesia. He said that the Soviet modern revisionist group deserves to die a thousand times!

Cha Huaduo said that a thousand imperialisms and a thousand modern revisionisms will never be able to stop the collapse of the Suharto-Nasution fascist ruling regime. The Indonesian people and overseas Chinese will unite as one to resist the persecution of the Indonesian fascist military regime. The Indonesian people have risen up, they have risen up to oppose imperialism and its running dogs, and they will definitely drive them out of Indonesian soil.

Cha Huaduo finally shouted: Long live the fighting unity of the Indonesian people and the Chinese people! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the savior of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought!

The rally read a message of condolence to the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The message encouraged the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to strengthen their unity with the Indonesian people, to dare to struggle and be good at struggling, to thoroughly smash any attack by the Indonesian reactionaries, and to strive for final victory.

At the end of the rally, everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale."

The revolutionary masses of the capital who attended the rally raised their arms and shouted: Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!
