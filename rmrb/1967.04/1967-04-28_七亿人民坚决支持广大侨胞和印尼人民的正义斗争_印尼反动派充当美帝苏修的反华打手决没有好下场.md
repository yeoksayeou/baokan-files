Ten thousand people in the capital solemnly held a rally today to strongly denounce and vehemently condemn the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, which have further sabotaged relations between the two countries.

The rally held by the revolutionary masses of the capital today is a rally of the Chinese people to the world to expose the crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto-Nasution. It is a rally to launch a fierce attack on the imperialists led by the United States and their accomplices and running dogs. It is a rally to firmly support the just struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

The rally expressed strong support for the statement issued by our government on the 26th, pointing out that the Indonesian reactionaries, acting as anti-China henchmen for the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, will meet a bad end. The rally warned the Indonesian reactionaries that the Chinese people are a great people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Republic of China is a great country of proletarian dictatorship as firm as a rock. The 700 million Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian reactionaries will ultimately escape their doom if they persist in their course.

The rally paid tribute to the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and bravely fighting against the Indonesian reactionaries. It praised their struggle against persecution, which is just and good, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people while greatly undermining the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries. The rally expressed that the 700 million people of the motherland will be a strong backing for the broad masses of overseas Chinese, and their just struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and responsible officials from relevant departments such as Liao Chengzhi, Su Yu, Han Nianlong, Nie Yuanzi, Ding Guoyu, representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards from the capital, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese attended the rally. Those who attended the rally also included Zhao Xiaoshou, who had protected the five-starred red flag with his blood in Jakarta and fought bravely against the Indonesian reactionaries, representatives of the heroic collective of 41 returned overseas Chinese youth who had fought unyieldingly against U.S. imperialists and Indonesian reactionaries in Medan, and relatives of Ning Xiangyu, an elderly overseas Chinese who was recently shot dead by the Indonesian reactionaries in Jakarta.

Revolutionary Indonesian friends in Beijing were invited to attend the rally. Among them were Cha Huaduo and his wife, Supeno and his wife, Isa and his wife, Wili and his wife, Sua'er, and Lasuduo.

The rally was held in the magnificent Workers' Stadium. The workers, commune members, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, Red Guard youngsters, and revolutionary cadres from various departments who attended the rally were filled with strong indignation against U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" "Firmly support the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese against persecution!" The atmosphere of the meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary fighting spirit.

After Nie Yuanzi, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, announced the beginning of the rally, the entire audience of 100,000 people sang "The East Is Red" and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Xie Fuzhi spoke first at the rally. (The full text is on the second page.) He said that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution, since they staged a counter-revolutionary coup and seized power, have brutally suppressed the people domestically and implemented fascist rule; externally, they have leaned on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and have been crazily anti-China and anti-Chinese. The heinous crimes committed by this small group of reactionaries against the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world are unforgivable and must be settled.

He said that over the past year, the Indonesian reactionary government has committed a series of anti-China atrocities. They have maliciously attacked and slandered our great motherland. They even dared to slander our most beloved leader, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao. This is a serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people and a serious provocation to the revolutionary people of the world. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. We must fight to the end with this small group of Indonesian reactionaries!

Xie Fuzhi pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government has been crazily persecuting hundreds of thousands of innocent overseas Chinese, and their methods are even more vicious than the atrocities of South African racism. Recently, they have once again directed their arrows at our embassy, even daring to expel our chargé d'affaires and consul-general. He said that the increasingly rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary government show that they are determined to be enemies of the Chinese people and to completely sabotage relations between the two countries and the friendly unity of the two peoples. We must warn the Indonesian reactionaries: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Our patience has its limits. You will not have a good end if you persist in your reckless actions. Xie Fuzhi said that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto and Nasution is a running dog raised by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and is a clique that came to power through a counter-revolutionary coup with the support of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism. Since they came to power, they have openly served the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war in Southeast Asia, acting as anti-China henchmen for the U.S. and Soviet revisionism. They have implemented fascist rule domestically, carrying out unprecedented large-scale suppression, massacre, and arrest of the Indonesian people. Tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Indonesian people have been sacrificed under their butcher's knife, and tens of thousands of patriotic people have been subjected to cruel persecution in prisons. The Suharto-Nasution regime is the most reactionary, most decadent, and most brutal regime in Indonesian history.

Xie Fuzhi said that the broad masses of overseas Chinese in our country have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and have bravely fought against persecution, deprivation, and for survival. Their struggle is not only for the protection of their legitimate rights but also for the national dignity of the motherland and for the maintenance of revolutionary friendship between China and the Indonesian people. They are fighting justly and well.

Xie Fuzhi said that the Chinese people are heart to heart with the Indonesian people. We express deep sympathy and firm support for the Indonesian people who are struggling hard. The heroic Indonesian people are not to be intimidated or subdued. They will definitely smash the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Indonesia. Indonesia will definitely become a revolutionary Indonesia.

Wu Zhao'an, a representative of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said in his speech, "Our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong, the red sun in our hearts, the great savior of millions of patriotic overseas Chinese, Chairman Mao! We wish you eternal life! Eternal life! We wish our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the closest comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, good health! Eternal health!"

Wu Zhao'an said that we returned overseas Chinese are extremely indignant and strongly protest against the Indonesian reactionaries' deliberate sabotage of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia and their fascist atrocities against overseas Chinese. The Indonesian reactionaries' persecution of overseas Chinese is precisely to cater to the needs of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism in their joint anti-China efforts, to divert the target of the people's struggle at home, and to attempt to sever the ties between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, which is a futile attempt! The broad masses of laboring overseas Chinese who have settled in Indonesia for generations have already formed an indestructible fighting friendship with the Indonesian people. The broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people will forever stand together, fight together, and win together! The Indonesian reactionaries will definitely not escape their doom! We must solemnly warn the Indonesian government: blood debts must be repaid with blood! You think you can subdue the broad masses of overseas Chinese with fascist terror, which is just a pipe dream! The broad masses of overseas Chinese are indomitable, unbreakable, and unkillable!

Wu Zhao'an said that we returned overseas Chinese will always be heart to heart with the overseas Chinese in the struggle. As long as the overseas Chinese in Indonesia hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, final victory will definitely belong to the patriotic overseas Chinese who dare to struggle and dare to win. We returned overseas Chinese will always be heart to heart with the Indonesian people. The revolutionary people of Indonesia will definitely rise up against the reactionaries. The invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be planted all over Indonesia.

Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Wang Jingrui, Beijing Municipal Farmers' Congress, Luo Ruihua, People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing, Xu Henglu, representatives from the Red Guards of higher education institutions in the capital, Dai Baoyuan, and representatives from the Red Guards of middle schools in the capital, Li Dongmin, spoke successively at the rally. They expressed their firm support for the statement of our government and their firm support for the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese. They said that the invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought guides the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, and the struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese against persecution will definitely achieve final victory.

Wang Jingrui said that the invincible and boundless great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly radiating its boundless power, guiding the revolutionary people of the world to rise up and rebel, making all reactionaries feel the threat of death. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sounded the death knell for imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Indonesian reactionaries are having a hysterical outburst and are making their last struggle, but in the face of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian reactionaries will only meet a shameful end of "making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing more, until they are destroyed."

Luo Ruihua said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the historical wheel, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably achieve victory." The Indonesian reactionary government's massacre of our overseas Chinese and sabotage of relations between the two countries only shows that they are a group of desperate, struggling beasts. Their days are numbered. The Indonesian reactionaries will definitely not escape the punishment of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

Xu Henglu said that the series of new anti-China crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries is part of the current anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are vigorously supporting the Indonesian reactionaries and cheering for their anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries are particularly eager to maliciously attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, all these evil activities will not save them from their doomed fate. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism colluding with the Indonesian reactionaries to jointly oppose China will inevitably start with the intention of harming others and end with the result of harming themselves.

Dai Baoyuan said that the eagerness of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries to oppose us shows that we are right and we are doing well! Under the banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, a great anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist army composed of the revolutionary people of the world and oppressed nations has already gathered. This revolutionary army will surely smash the old world, bury all systems of exploitation, eliminate all harmful creatures, and a new world illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be in our hands. He said that the armed struggle of the revolutionary people of Indonesia will ultimately bury the reactionary military regime of Indonesia. Indonesia is the Indonesia of the Indonesian people! The world will definitely belong to the people!

Li Dongmin said that the Indonesian reactionaries have launched a new and unprecedented wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, acting as the vanguard of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism in their anti-China efforts, reflecting that their class struggle at home is becoming increasingly sharp and their fascist rule is already in a precarious situation. The emergency "joint action" of the U.S., Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries in their anti-China farce once again shows that they are the true enemies of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia, the common enemies of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world. He said that we are the Red Guards of Chairman Mao. We hold high the banner of "Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified" and are making a big fuss against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. We will also make a big fuss against the U.S., Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries. We Red Guards are the strong backing of the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

Indonesian friend Cha Huaduo spoke at the rally (the full text is on the second page), strongly condemning the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime for its bloody suppression of the Indonesian people and its savage anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. He said that the Indonesian people and patriots not only hate and curse the Indonesian fascist military regime and its fascist behavior but also have the responsibility to take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and resolutely overthrow this regime.

Cha Huaduo said that the Indonesian people have found the way to smash this fascist clique, which is the road of people's war, the road of Mao Zedong. We express our deepest gratitude to the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao for their fraternal sympathy and support.

Cha Huaduo exposed the extremely brutal suppression of the Indonesian people by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. He said that they are more brutal than Hitler, who is cursed by the whole world. At present, this small group of fascist generals in power has already pawned our country to U.S. imperialism, and they are plotting to make the Indonesian people a cheap labor reserve force for imperialism. However, the Suharto-Nasution regime is acting as their watchdog.

Cha Huaduo said that under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, Indonesia has been included in the global strategy of imperialism led by the United States, and their main target is aimed at the strongest fortress of anti-imperialist struggle in the world—China. The policy of the Indonesian fascist regime is to serve imperialism and oppose China.

Cha Huaduo strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionist group for continuously providing economic and military aid to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and actively spreading modern revisionist thoughts to split the revolutionary ranks of Indonesia. He said that the Soviet modern revisionist group deserves to die a thousand times!

Cha Huaduo said that a thousand imperialisms and a thousand modern revisionisms will never be able to stop the collapse of the Suharto-Nasution fascist ruling regime. The Indonesian people and overseas Chinese will unite as one to resist the persecution of the Indonesian fascist military regime. The Indonesian people have risen up, they have risen up to oppose imperialism and its running dogs, and they will definitely drive them out of Indonesian soil.

Cha Huaduo finally shouted: Long live the fighting unity of the Indonesian people and the Chinese people! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the savior of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought!

The rally read a message of condolence to the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The message encouraged the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to strengthen their unity with the Indonesian people, to dare to struggle and be good at struggling, to thoroughly smash any attack by the Indonesian reactionaries, and to strive for final victory.

At the end of the rally, everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale."

The revolutionary masses of the capital who attended the rally raised their arms and shouted: Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!

    首都十万人集会坚决拥护政府声明愤怒声讨印尼反动派法西斯罪行
    七亿人民坚决支持广大侨胞和印尼人民的正义斗争  印尼反动派充当美帝苏修的反华打手决没有好下场
    新华社二十七日讯　“最强烈抗议印尼反动派的反华排华罪行！”“血债要用血来还！”“七亿中国人民誓作印尼爱国华侨的后盾！”在无产阶级文化大革命中胜利前进的首都革命群众，今天有十万人庄严举行集会，强烈谴责和愤怒声讨印度尼西亚反动派反华排华、进一步破坏两国关系的滔天罪行。
    首都革命群众今天举行的大会，是中国人民向全世界人民控诉以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派的大会，是向以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗猛烈开火的大会，是坚决支持印尼广大华侨和印尼人民正义斗争的大会。
    大会表示坚决拥护我国政府二十六日的声明，指出印尼反动派充当美帝、苏修的反华打手，决没有好下场。大会正告印尼反动派，中国人民是用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大人民，中华人民共和国是坚如磐石的无产阶级专政的伟大国家，七亿中国人民坚决支持印尼广大华侨的正义斗争和印尼人民的革命斗争，印尼反动派一意孤行，最终逃脱不了灭亡的命运。
    大会向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同印尼反动派进行英勇斗争的广大爱国侨胞致敬，赞扬他们进行的反迫害斗争，斗得有理，斗得好，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了印尼反动派的威风。大会表示，祖国七亿人民誓作广大侨胞的坚强后盾，广大侨胞的正义斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，各有关方面的负责人廖承志、粟裕、韩念龙、聂元梓、丁国钰，首都工、农、兵、红卫兵的代表，归国华侨的代表出席了大会。出席大会的，还有曾在雅加达用鲜血保护五星国旗、同印尼反动派进行了英勇斗争的外交工作人员赵小寿，在印尼棉兰同美帝国主义分子和印尼反动派进行了不屈不挠斗争的英雄集体——四十一名归国华侨青少年的代表，和最近在雅加达被印尼反动派枪杀的华侨老人宁祥雨的亲属。
    在北京的革命的印度尼西亚朋友应邀出席了大会。他们当中有查禾多和夫人、苏佩诺和夫人、伊萨和夫人、威利和夫人、苏阿尔、拉斯多诺等。
    声讨大会在宏伟的工人体育场举行。参加大会的工人、公社社员、人民解放军陆海空三军指战员、红卫兵小将、机关革命干部，怀着对美帝国主义和印尼反动派的强烈愤慨，不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒印尼反动派！”“坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争！”“坚决支持印尼爱国华侨的反迫害斗争！”会场上充满了强烈的革命战斗的气氛。
    北京市革命委员会副主任委员聂元梓宣布大会开始后，全场十万人高唱《东方红》，并且齐声朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    谢富治首先在大会上讲话。（全文见第二版）他说，以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人集团，自从发动反革命政变、篡夺政权以后，对内残酷镇压人民，实行法西斯统治；对外投靠美帝和苏修，疯狂地反华排华。这一小撮反动派对印尼人民、中国人民和全世界人民犯下的累累罪行，是不可饶恕的，是一定要清算的。
    他说，一年多来，印尼反动政府制造了一系列反华暴行。他们对我们伟大的祖国进行恶毒的攻击和诽谤。他们竟然胆敢诬蔑我们最最敬爱的领袖、世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席。这是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅，也是对全世界革命人民的严重挑衅。这是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要同一小撮印尼反动派坚决斗争到底！
    谢富治指出，印尼反动政府疯狂迫害几百万无辜华侨，其手段的毒辣大大超过了南非种族主义暴行，最近，他们再一次把矛头指向我国大使馆，甚至悍然驱逐我国的代办和总领事。他说，印尼反动政府越来越猖狂的反华排华活动，表明他们决心要同中国人民为敌，要彻底破坏两国关系和两国人民的友好团结。我们要正告印尼反动派：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的。我们的忍耐是有限度的。你们蛮干到底绝不会有好下场。谢富治说，以苏哈托和纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人集团，是美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义豢养的走狗，是在美帝、苏修扶植下发动反革命政变上台的。他们上台以来，就公然为美帝在东南亚的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，充当美帝、苏修反华的打手。他们在国内实行法西斯统治，对印尼人民进行了空前的大镇压、大屠杀、大逮捕。数十万印尼人民的优秀儿女，牺牲在他们的屠刀之下，成千上万的爱国人民在监狱中受到残酷的迫害。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权是印尼历史上最反动、最腐朽、最残暴的政权。　
    谢富治说，我国在印尼的广大侨胞，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进行了英勇的反迫害、反剥夺、求生存的斗争。他们的斗争不仅是为了维护他们自己的正当权益，为了祖国的民族尊严，也是为了维护中国和印尼人民的革命友谊。他们斗得有理，斗得好。
    谢富治说，中国人民同印尼人民是心连心的。我们对于正在艰苦奋斗的印尼人民，表示深切的同情和坚决的支持。英雄的印度尼西亚人民是吓不倒，压不服的。他们一定能够粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗在印尼的反动统治。印度尼西亚一定要成为革命的印度尼西亚。
    印尼归国华侨代表吴招安在讲话中说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们千千万万爱国侨胞的大救星，毛主席！祝愿您老人家，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！祝愿毛主席最亲密的战友，我们敬爱的林彪副统帅身体健康！永远健康！
    吴招安说，对于印尼反动派蓄意恶化中国、印尼两国外交关系的强盗行为和疯狂迫害华侨的法西斯暴行，我们革命归侨表示极大的愤慨和最最强烈的抗议。印尼反动派疯狂迫害华侨，正是为了迎合美帝、苏修联合反华的需要，是为了转移国内人民斗争的目标，妄想切断华侨同印尼人民的联系，这真是痴心妄想！世代居留在印尼的广大劳苦华侨，早已同印尼人民结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。广大华侨和印尼人民永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！印尼反动派绝对逃避不了它的灭亡的命运！我们要严正警告印尼政府，血债必须用血来还！你们妄图以法西斯恐怖手段来压服广大华侨，简直是白日作梦！广大华侨永远是压不倒、冲不垮、杀不绝的！
    吴招安说，我们归国华侨永远同斗争中的印尼华侨心连着心。只要印尼华侨更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最后胜利一定是属于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的爱国华侨的。我们归国华侨永远同印尼人民心连着心。印尼革命人民终究要造反动派的反，战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大红旗必定插遍全印尼。
    北京市工代会代表王景瑞、北京市农代会代表罗瑞华、中国人民解放军驻京部队代表徐恒禄、首都大专院校红代会代表戴宝元，首都中学红代会代表李冬民相继在大会上讲话。他们表示坚决拥护我国政府声明，坚决支持印尼爱国侨胞的斗争。他们说，战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引着广大爱国侨胞，广大侨胞进行的反迫害斗争，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    王景瑞说，光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想越来越迸发出她的无比威力，引导全世界革命人民起来斗争，起来造反，使一切反动派感到死亡的威胁。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了帝国主义、现代修正主义、一切反动派的丧钟。印尼反动派歇斯底里大发作，进行最后挣扎，但是，在毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民面前，印尼反动派得到的只能是，也一定是“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的可耻下场。
    罗瑞华说，毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”印尼反动政府疯狂地屠杀我们的侨胞，破坏两国关系，这只能说明他们是一群走投无路、绝望挣扎的野兽。他们的日子不长了。印尼反动派绝对逃脱不了印尼人民、中国人民和世界人民的惩罚。
    徐恒禄说，印尼反动派这一系列的反华的新罪行，是当前帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反华大合唱的一个组成部分。美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义正在大力扶植印尼反动派，为印尼反动派反华排华叫好。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印尼反动派，还特别起劲地恶毒攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命。但是，这一切罪恶活动，是绝对挽救不了它们的失败命运的。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义勾结印尼反动派，联合反华，必然是以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。
    戴宝元说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、印尼反动派如此起劲地反对我们，正说明我们做得对，做得好！在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利旗帜下，在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，已经集结起一支由世界革命人民和被压迫民族组成的反帝反修大军。这支革命大军必将冲垮旧世界，埋葬一切剥削制度，扫除一切害人虫，一个毛泽东思想光辉普照的红彤彤的新世界，必将出现在我们手中。他说，革命的印尼人民的武装斗争必将最终埋葬印尼反动军人政权。印尼是印尼人民的印尼！世界一定是人民的世界！
    李冬民说，印尼反动派掀起新的、空前规模的反华排华浪潮，充当美帝苏修反华的马前卒，反映了他们国内的阶级斗争是日益尖锐化，他们的法西斯统治已经岌岌可危。美帝、苏修、印尼反动派紧急“联合行动”演出的反华丑剧，再次表明他们是印尼华侨的真正敌人，是印尼人民、中国人民及全世界革命人民的共同敌人。他说，我们是毛主席的红卫兵。我们高举“革命无罪，造反有理”的大旗，大造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，我们还要大造美帝、苏修的反，大造印尼反动派的反。我们红卫兵是广大华侨的坚强后盾。
    印尼朋友查禾多在大会上讲话（全文见第二版），痛斥苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权血腥镇压印尼人民，野蛮地反华排华。他说，印尼人民和印尼爱国者，不但痛恨和咒骂印尼法西斯军人政权和他们的法西斯行为，也有责任以毛泽东思想作为武器，下定决心推翻这个政权。
    查禾多说，印尼人民已经找到了怎样砸烂这个法西斯集团的道路，这就是人民战争的道路，毛泽东的道路。我们向毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，表示最大的感谢。感谢他们给予我们兄弟般的同情和支持。
    查禾多揭露了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权对印尼人民进行极其残酷的镇压。他说，他们比全世界所咒骂的希特勒更残酷。目前这一小撮当权的法西斯将军已经把我们的国家典当给美国帝国主义，他们阴谋把印尼人民作为帝国主义廉价的苦力后备军。而苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权却充当他们的看门狗。
    查禾多说，在美帝国主义指使下，印度尼西亚已纳入以美国为首的帝国主义全球战略范围，他们的主要目标就是对准世界上最坚强的反帝斗争堡垒——中国。印尼法西斯政权的政策就是为帝国主义效劳，反对中国。
    查禾多强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义集团向苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权不断提供经济和军事援助，并且积极地散布现代修正主义思想，分裂印尼革命队伍。他说，苏联现代修正主义集团罪该万死！
    查禾多说，一千个帝国主义和一千个现代修正主义也绝不能阻止苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯统治政权的垮台。印尼人民和华侨必将团结一致，共同反抗印尼法西斯军人政权的迫害，印尼人民已经站起来了，他们起来反对帝国主义及其走狗，而且必将把他们从印尼大地上清除出去。
    查禾多最后高呼：印尼人民和中国人民的战斗团结万岁！全世界人民的救星毛主席、毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    大会上宣读了致印度尼西亚爱国华侨的慰问电。慰问电中勉励广大爱国侨胞更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更紧密地加强同印尼人民的团结，敢于斗争，善于斗争，彻底粉碎印尼反动派的任何进攻，争取最后的胜利。
    大会结束时，全体高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》。
