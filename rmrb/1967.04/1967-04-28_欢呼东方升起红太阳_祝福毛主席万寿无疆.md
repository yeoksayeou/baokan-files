The documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts - Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" is screened in Shanghai and Xi'an, inspiring a vast number of revolutionary masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 27 - Amid the drumbeats of the broad revolutionary masses rising up to criticize the handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai watched the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts - Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" with boundless joy and were greatly inspired. They resolutely declared that they would definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party; combine the great criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, promote the great unity of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

A red sun rises in the east, and a thousand beams of golden light shine brightly. When the screen displayed the radiant image of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai cheered excitedly: "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!"

The workers of Shanghai, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the suburbs, after watching this film, were so excited that they could not calm down for a long time. They held meetings, wrote articles, and expressed their thoughts and resolutions. They said, "Chairman Mao is so healthy, this is the greatest happiness for us, the broad masses of workers and peasants! We sincerely wish him a long, long life! We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher and higher, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, grasp the revolution and promote production, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Many labor models said after watching this film, "We must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and use Mao Zedong Thought as a thousand-catty hammer to overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party, and be determined to be pioneers in grasping the revolution and models in promoting production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!"

The Red Guards were so moved that they had tears in their eyes. They said, "During the days of white terror created by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, it was Chairman Mao who most supported our revolution and our rebellion. In our most difficult times of struggle, we looked at Chairman Mao's portrait a thousand times and recited Chairman Mao's quotations a thousand times. Thinking of Chairman Mao, we see clearly; thinking of Chairman Mao, we are full of strength throughout our bodies." They swore to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud! We must fully use the 'four weapons,' actively participate in the battle to criticize the top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party, and we will not rest until we pull down the Chinese Khrushchev!"

The revolutionary young people of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School, who have achieved great unity in the great criticism of the revolution, resolutely declared that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao, further combine the great criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, consolidate the great unity of the revolution, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary cadres saw on the screen the touching scenes of Chairman Mao being with the revolutionary masses and were greatly inspired. They said, "Chairman Mao cares so much for the masses and loves the masses so much, which is our most brilliant example to learn from! We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever breathe with the revolutionary masses, share their destiny, reform our thoughts for life, and serve the people for life."

After this film was screened among the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, it further aroused the officers and soldiers' boundless love for the supreme commander Chairman Mao. The sailors on a certain ship of the East China Fleet, which Chairman Mao had inspected, happily recalled the most unforgettable days they spent with Chairman Mao while watching this film. They said, "Although we are thousands of miles away from Chairman Mao, our hearts are forever with Chairman Mao. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to support the broad leftist masses and assist agricultural and industrial production, and thoroughly smash the evil plot of the handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party to restore capitalism in China. The enemy will be destroyed if they do not surrender."

On April 26, more than sixty movie theaters, workers' clubs, and projection stations in Shanghai started screening this film simultaneously. Before that, this film had been previewed in factories, rural areas, the military, and schools. The staff of the screening units resolutely declared that they would screen this film with the deepest class feelings and the most serious and responsible work attitude, so that more revolutionary masses can see Chairman Mao on the screen as soon as possible, and let Chairman Mao's radiant image be deeply engraved in the hearts of the revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary masses shouted in unison, "Long live, long live our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao!"

On April 26, more than 90,000 people in the city watched this film. When the great leader Chairman Mao's vigorous and great image appeared on the screen, a thunderous cheer and applause erupted from the masses. They said, "Chairman Mao's health and longevity are the greatest happiness for hundreds of millions of revolutionary people!" Many proletarian revolutionary fighters expressed their determination: "We must forever follow Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao; we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher and higher, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, overthrow, smash, and expose the top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

When the film was screened in some factories, workers saw the moving scene of the great leader Chairman Mao walking over the Golden Water Bridge to the masses, and many people shed tears of excitement. They spontaneously cheered with the revolutionary masses in the film: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" The workers said, "Chairman Mao loves the masses the most, trusts the masses the most, and shares the same destiny with the masses, forever with us heart to heart." They resolutely declared: "We must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, overthrow and expose the top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. We must combine the criticism of the handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own regions and units, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production."

The revolutionary young people in colleges and universities jumped for joy after watching this film. They said: "Chairman Mao cares for us the most, supports us the most. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, love the great leader Chairman Mao the most, read Chairman Mao's books the most, and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and strive to be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause." They said, "We must overthrow, smash, and expose the top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in all of China and the world! Forever fly high!"
