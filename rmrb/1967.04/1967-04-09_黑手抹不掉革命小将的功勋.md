Currently, in accordance with the needs of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary Red Guards have begun to rectify our work and are universally carrying out the education movement of Mao Zedong Thought. A battle to break private interests and establish public interests from the depths of the soul has begun! This is a great display of the high revolutionary consciousness of the Red Guard youth, and this is a great display of the thorough revolutionary spirit of the Red Guard youth.

However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who have been overthrown by the Red Guards, are blinded by profit. They are taking advantage of our opportunity to rectify our work openly and are extending black hands from behind to engage in capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

They seize upon some of our shortcomings in the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution, exaggerate and magnify them, and try to smear the Red Guards.

They slander the Red Guard youth for "rebelling for personal gain," "being 'left' in form but right in essence," and "rebelling in reverse," attempting to erase the merits of the Red Guards and fundamentally deny the Red Guard youth, creating public opinion for their own rehabilitation.

They accuse the proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line of "smashing everything and excluding everything," and impose this crime on the Red Guard youth.

They also use certain shortcomings of the Red Guard youth to make a big deal out of nothing, trying to grasp at straws.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit their future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves." The current counter-revolutionary reverse current of capitalist restoration initiated by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deeply illustrates that the class enemies who have been overthrown are not reconciled to their defeat. They are looking for "gaps" and "scouting directions," attempting to achieve capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. "We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, must study their strategies, in order to defeat them. We must not be too naive and see the complex class struggle too simply." Chairman Mao's wise teachings, we must always keep in mind.

We must warn the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road: We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. Under the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, our Red Guards' overall direction has always been correct, and the great achievements established in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are indelible by anyone. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth. Our hearts are the reddest, and our eyes are the brightest. Since we have already pulled you down from your thrones, we will definitely be able to knock you down to the ground and step on you with another foot. Your counterattack and revenge plot will never succeed. We must carry the awareness of the enemy, do a good job in our rectification, and temper our troops into a highly revolutionary and highly combat-ready proletarian revolutionary force. We will further enhance our revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    黑手抹不掉革命小将的功勋
    山东师范学院文革串连红卫兵　慨而慷战斗队
    目前，根据无产阶级文化大革命斗争形势的需要，我们革命的红卫兵开始了整风，普遍地进行毛泽东思想教育运动。一场从灵魂深处破私立公的战斗打响了！这是红卫兵小将高度革命自觉性的大发扬，这是红卫兵小将彻底革命精神的大发扬。
    然而，被红卫兵打翻在地的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却利令智昏，他们趁我们开门整风的机会，从背后伸出了黑手，大搞资本主义反革命复辟活动。
    他们抓住我们在前段文化大革命运动中的一些缺点，渲染扩大，极力往红卫兵脸上抹灰。
    他们污蔑红卫兵小将“为私造反”，“形‘左’实右”，“造反过头”，妄图抹煞红卫兵的功勋，从根本上否定红卫兵小将，为自己的翻案制造舆论。
    他们把资产阶级反动路线提出者大搞“打倒一切、排斥一切”的罪名，强加于红卫兵小将头上。
    他们还利用红卫兵小将的某些缺点，大作文章，想捞稻草。
    毛主席教导我们：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”目前由党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派掀起的资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，深刻地说明，已被打倒的阶级敌人并不甘心他们的失败，他们正在寻找“缺口”、“窥测方向”，妄图实现资本主义反革命复辟。“我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”毛主席的这个英明教导，我们要永记在心。
    我们要警告党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派：我们是毛主席的红小兵，在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，我们红卫兵的大方向始终是正确的，在无产阶级文化大革命中所建立的丰功伟绩是任何人也抹煞不了的。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，我们天不怕，地不怕，我们心最红，眼最亮。我们既然已经把你们从宝座上揪了下来，就一定能够把你们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。你们的反攻倒算阴谋永远不会得逞。我们一定要带着敌情观念，搞好我们的整风，把我们的队伍锻炼成为非常革命化、非常战斗化的无产阶级革命队伍，进一步增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
