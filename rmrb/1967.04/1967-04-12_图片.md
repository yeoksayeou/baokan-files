The masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Zhai Village Brigade of Songzhuang People's Commune in Tong County, Beijing, have united as one in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have smashed the enemy's furious counterattack and safeguarded the great achievements of the "Four Clean-ups" movement. They have launched a spring ploughing and production campaign. This is Comrade Deng Wantiang (first from the right), a brigade cadre who has withstood the stern test of class struggle. Before going to work, he leads everyone in studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," using politics to command production.
