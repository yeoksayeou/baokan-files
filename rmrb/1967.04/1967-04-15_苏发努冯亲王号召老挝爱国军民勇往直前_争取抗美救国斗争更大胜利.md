Prince Souphanouvong Calls on Lao Patriots to Press Forward and Achieve Greater Victories in the Anti-American National Salvation Struggle

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Kengtong on the 14th, the Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted on the 13th: On the occasion of the Lao New Year (Songkran), Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, Prince Souphanouvong, addressed a message to the military and people of the entire nation, calling on them to further strengthen unity and achieve greater victories in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

Souphanouvong said: Over the past year, our national enemy—the American imperialists and their lackeys—have used various brutal weapons of war to intensify their attacks on the liberated areas of Laos from the ground and the air. They have also actively implemented their sinister plan to force the people into so-called "development zones," "unity villages," and "refugee camps," which are in fact concentration camps. The American imperialists and their lackeys have committed heinous crimes against our nation and people. They arrogantly attempt to make our people their slaves again. However, our nation is a heroic nation that will never surrender to the invaders and traitors.

Souphanouvong said, over the past year, under the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao military and people have fiercely struck back at the invading enemy, bravely repulsed the enemy's numerous attacks, annihilated more than ten thousand enemy troops, and shot down over two hundred enemy aircraft. In just the past October, our military and people have annihilated over three thousand enemy troops and shot down more than forty enemy aircraft.

He said, at the same time, our people's war has flourished, and various armed forces have grown and strengthened. The unity among the various ethnic groups and patriotic forces has been continuously enhanced.

Souphanouvong called on the Lao patriotic military and people to further strengthen unity among the various ethnic groups; strengthen the alliance between the Lao Patriotic Front and patriotic neutral forces, making it more solid; vigorously defend, consolidate, and build strong liberated areas from all aspects; strengthen and build various armed forces; widely carry out guerrilla warfare, strive to increase production, and push the anti-American national salvation struggle to decisive victories.

Souphanouvong firmly believes that, for the sake of the motherland and to defeat the American bandits and their lackeys, the Lao military and people, who have a tradition of brave struggle, will press forward bravely and resolutely complete the above sacred tasks.

    苏发努冯亲王号召老挝爱国军民勇往直前
    争取抗美救国斗争更大胜利
    据新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮电台十三日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，在老挝新年（宋干节）之际，向老挝全国军民致祝词，号召老挝全国军民进一步加强团结，在抗美救国斗争中取得更新更大的胜利。
    苏发努冯说：一年来，我们民族的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗使用各种野蛮的战争工具，从地面和空中加紧对老挝解放区进行袭击，并积极推行把人民集中到所谓“振兴区”、“团结村”和“避难区”等变相集中营去的阴谋计划。美帝国主义及其走狗对我们民族和人民犯下了滔天的罪行。它们妄图迫使我国人民重新做它们的奴隶。但是，我们的民族是一个英雄的民族，是绝不会向侵略者和卖国贼投降的。
    苏发努冯说，一年来，老挝军民在老挝爱国战线党的英明领导下，狠狠地打击来犯的敌人，英勇地粉碎了敌人的各次进攻，消灭了敌人一万多名，击落敌机二百多架。仅在去年十月以来，我国军民就消灭敌人三千多名，击落敌机四十多架。
    他说，与此同时，我们的人民战争得到了蓬勃的发展，各种武装力量也得到了进一步成长和壮大，各兄弟民族之间、各种爱国力量之间的团结也得到了不断增强。
    苏发努冯号召老挝爱国军民进一步加强各民族之间的团结；加强老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的联盟，使之更加巩固；从各方面积极保卫、巩固和建设强大的解放区；大力巩固和建设各种武装力量；广泛地开展游击战争，努力增加生产，把抗美救国斗争事业推向具有决定性的胜利。
    苏发努冯坚信，为了祖国，为了战胜美国强盗及其走狗，具有英勇斗争传统的老挝军民，将会勇往直前，坚决完成上述的神圣任务。
