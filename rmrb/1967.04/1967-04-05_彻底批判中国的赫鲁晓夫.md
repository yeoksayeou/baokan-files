The publication of Comrade Chen Boda's article "Patriotism or Treachery?—A Critique of the Reactionary Film 'The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty'" is a major political event of great significance at present. It is a new call to arms for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This article, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, has exposed the counterrevolutionary face of the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, who pretends to be revolutionary but is actually counterrevolutionary. It has laid bare their reactionary nature of loving imperialism and hating the revolutionary people, loving the bourgeoisie and hating the workers and peasants, loving capitalism and hating socialism. With the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, this article has launched a fierce attack on the hidden Khrushchev in China. This article represents the resolute revolutionary will of the proletarian revolutionary forces. It is a solemn declaration of war and denunciation against a handful of big bad guys who oppose Mao Zedong Thought. We must study this article seriously and throw ourselves into this new great criticism.

"The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" is an extremely reactionary, thoroughly treacherous film. Seventeen years ago, when this reactionary film first appeared, Chairman Mao pointed out its sharp criticism. Later, Chairman Mao again pointed out that this film is treacherous, thoroughly treacherous. However, a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries, wearing the masks of "Communist Party members" and "proletarian revolutionaries," with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, have actively acted as spokesmen for imperialism, feudalism, and the reactionary bourgeoisie. They have praised such a treacherous reactionary film as a "patriotic" film. For seventeen years, they have openly defied Chairman Mao's instructions, stubbornly resisted, and suppressed the correct criticism of this film. They have done so not by chance but because, on a series of fundamental issues such as how to deal with imperialist aggression, how to deal with revolutionary mass movements, and how to deal with the socialist and capitalist roads, they have long had major principled differences with the proletarian revolutionary forces led by Chairman Mao. This handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries and the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party behind them love the country of imperialism and the country of landlords and the bourgeoisie, not our great motherland under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They yearn for the capitalist and bourgeois reformist road, not the brilliant socialist future. Therefore, the struggle around the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" is not just a matter of one film but a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and bourgeois reformism and revisionism, a struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration. In the end, it is a struggle between capitalism and socialism over who will triumph.

The two evaluations of one film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" reflect the political divide between the proletarian revolutionary forces and the bourgeois representatives, exposing the counterrevolutionary face of the disguised "revolutionaries." "Once the wind rises from the earth, the white bones will pile up." For a long time, in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two ideologies, this disguised "revolutionary" has always stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie. Long before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he brazenly propagated the philosophy of survival, the philosophy of surrender, and the philosophy of betrayal. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he attempted to hand over the people's armed forces, won with the blood of countless martyrs, to the knife-sharpening U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and called for the development of capitalism in China. For seventeen years since liberation, the struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration has been fiercely waged without a moment's respite. Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the basic victory of our socialist revolution, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight the working class in all aspects, including the ideological aspect." The bourgeoisie has launched a comprehensive, rampant attack on the proletariat in all fields, including politics, economics, culture, and education, with the source being the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party. This person is China's Khrushchev. It is this China's Khrushchev who dares to defy the heavens and fiercely oppose our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao; it is this China's Khrushchev who praises the blood-sucking rich peasants and bourgeoisie a hundredfold, even begging for the exploitation of capitalists, opposing the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and opposing agricultural cooperativization; it is this China's Khrushchev who, after the completion of the three transformations, vigorously advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and during the three years of natural disasters, in collusion with domestic and foreign ghosts and monsters, advocates "self-management, self-reliance, and self-improvement," and "three reconciliations and one reduction," maliciously slandering the three red banners; it is this China's Khrushchev who, in the socialist education movement, vigorously protects the capitalist-roaders in authority, implements the opportunist line of "smashing everything" and "excluding everything," which is "left" in form but right in essence; it is this China's Khrushchev who confuses right and wrong, creates white terror, and suppresses the revolutionary forces, attempting to extinguish the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In a word, they want to usurp the Party, the government, and the army, and attempt to restore capitalism in China. Such a gang of traitors must be pulled down from their horses and made to stand aside.

All comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces must, in this total attack on the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, charge forward, fight bravely, smash the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. This great struggle of criticism will be a powerful driving force for the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Through this great struggle of criticism, it will surely promote the rapid realization of the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party has put forward a bourgeois reactionary line, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They direct their spearheads at the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Because the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been thoroughly purged, it seriously obstructs the realization of the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." All revolutionary mass organizations must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries, at the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, and at the bourgeois reactionary line. All revolutionary mass organizations that are still fighting "internal wars" must immediately stop the "internal wars" and join this great struggle of criticism. Through the struggle, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and under the premise of a unified direction, unite and organize. The bourgeois reactionary line on the issue of cadres must also be thoroughly criticized. Implementing this bourgeois reactionary line will inevitably result in "striking a large number and protecting a few." We must oppose this and, instead, strike a few and unite a large number, organizing a vast army of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to thoroughly smash the plot of a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries and the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party to restore capitalism in China, ensuring that our great motherland will never change color!

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces, all revolutionary people who love Chairman Mao: The heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev are innumerable. China's Khrushchev is the common enemy of the whole Party and the people of the whole country. In the face of a great enemy, we must thoroughly overthrow them. We must launch a people's war, letting them perish in the vast ocean of the people's war! Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." All comrades in factories, rural areas, the army, schools, government agencies, and shops in all sectors and aspects must mobilize urgently, and the whole Party and the whole country must jointly condemn and attack the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party!

"The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong!" Our greatest pride and honor is that Chairman Mao personally leads us to successfully carry out this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries and the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Our most beloved Chairman Mao, it is you who led our people out of the depths of misery, and it is your brilliant thoughts that have illuminated the brilliant path of our socialist revolution and construction, enabling us to recognize all monsters and demons. We pledge to you: Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will make them perish!

Down with the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party!
Defend Chairman Mao to the death!
Defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death!
Long live, long, long live our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!

    彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫
    ——上海《文汇报》四月二日社论
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？——评反动影片〈清宫秘史〉》一文的发表，是当前全国极其重大的政治事件。是当前无产阶级文化大革命的新的进军号。这篇文章高举革命的批判的旗帜，揭开了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的假革命、反革命的嘴脸。把他们对帝国主义亲、对革命人民恨，对资产阶级亲、对工农群众恨，对资本主义亲、对社会主义恨的反动面目暴露在光天化日之下。这篇文章以战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器，向暗藏在中国的赫鲁晓夫发动了最猛烈的进攻。这篇文章，代表了我们无产阶级革命派坚强的革命意志，它是对反毛泽东思想的一小撮大坏蛋的一份义正词严的宣战书、声讨书。我们要认真学习这篇文章，投入到这场新的大批判中去。
    《清宫秘史》是一部极其反动的、彻底的卖国主义的影片。十七年前，当这部反动影片刚一出笼的时候，毛主席就提出了尖锐的批评。后来，毛主席又指出这部影片是卖国主义的，彻底的卖国主义。但是，一小撮披着“共产党员”、“无产阶级革命家”外衣的反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派支持下，却积极充当帝国主义、封建主义、反动资产阶级的代言人，把这样一部卖国主义的反动影片誉之为“爱国主义”的影片，十七年来公然对抗毛主席的指示，顽固拒绝并扼杀了对这部影片的严正批判。他们所以这样混淆黑白，颠倒是非，绝非偶然。在怎样对待帝国主义的侵略，怎样对待革命的群众运动，怎样对待社会主义道路和资本主义道路等一系列根本问题上，他们同以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命派早就存在重大原则的分歧。这一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以及背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，他们爱的是帝国主义的国，爱的是地主、资产阶级的国，而不是我们无产阶级专政的伟大祖国。他们一心向往的是资本主义和资产阶级改良主义的道路，而不是光芒万丈的社会主义前途。正因为这样，围绕着反动影片《清宫秘史》展开的斗争，决不仅仅是一部电影的问题，而是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同资产阶级改良主义、修正主义思想的斗争，是资本主义复辟同无产阶级反复辟的斗争。归根结底，是资本主义同社会主义谁战胜谁的斗争。
    一部《清宫秘史》的两种评价，反映了无产阶级革命派同资产阶级代表人物的政治分野，暴露了伪装的“革命家”的反革命面目。“一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”长期以来，在两个阶级、两条路线、两种思想的斗争中，这个伪装的“革命家”始终站在资产阶级反动立场上。远在抗日战争爆发前夕，他竟大肆宣扬活命哲学、投降哲学、叛徒哲学；在抗日战争胜利后，他竟企图把无数烈士用鲜血换来的人民武装，双手拱让给磨刀霍霍的美帝国主义及其走狗，为在中国发展资本主义而奔走呼号。解放十七年来，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争无时无刻不在激烈地进行着。毛主席教导我们：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”资产阶级向无产阶级发动了一个遍及政治、经济、文化、教育等各个领域的、全面性的猖狂进攻，其源盖出于党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。此人就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟敢冒天下之大不韪，疯狂反对我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席；就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟百倍赞美靠吸血为生的富农、资产阶级，甚至请求资本家的剥削，反对对资本主义工商业的改造，反对农业合作化；就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在三大改造完成后，竟大肆鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，在三年自然灾害期间，竟与国内外牛鬼蛇神遥相呼应，鼓吹“三自一包”、“三和一少”，恣意诋毁三面红旗；就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在社会主义教育运动中竭力庇护走资本主义道路当权派，推行了“打倒一切”、“排斥一切”的形“左”实右的机会主义路线；就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，围剿革命派，制造白色恐怖，企图扑灭轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。一句话，他们要篡党篡政篡军，妄图在中国实行资本主义复辟。对于这样一伙祸国殃民的“白骨精”，必须把他们拉下马，叫他们靠边站。
    一切无产阶级革命派同志，都要在这场向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的总攻击中，冲锋陷阵，英勇战斗，大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，从政治上、思想上彻底夺权。这场大批判斗争，是促进革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”的思想上的动力。通过这场大批判，必将有力地推动革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”的迅速实现。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在这次文化大革命中，抛出了一条资产阶级反动路线，与以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。他们把矛头指向广大革命群众和革命干部。由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒还没有彻底肃清，严重地障碍着实现革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”。一切革命的群众组织，都要坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧紧把握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头直指一小撮反革命修正主义分子，直指党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，直指资产阶级反动路线。凡是还在打“内战”的革命群众组织，都要立即停止“内战”，投入这场大批判斗争。通过斗争，在毛泽东思想的基础上，在大方向一致的前提下，联合起来，团结起来。在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，也必须彻底批判。贯彻了这条资产阶级反动路线，必然对广大干部实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，我们要针锋相对，反其道而行之，打击一小撮，团结一大片，组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命的大军，彻底粉碎一小撮反革命修正主义分子和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，保证我们伟大的祖国永不变色！
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，一切热爱毛主席的革命人民：中国的赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，罄竹难书，中国的赫鲁晓夫，是全党全国人民的死敌。大敌当前，必须把他们彻底打倒。我们要发动一场人民战争，让他们在人民战争的汪洋大海中遭灭顶之灾！毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”一切工厂、农村、部队、学校、机关、商店等各条战线各个方面的同志，都要紧急动员起来，对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，全党共诛之，全国共讨之！
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”！我们引为最大的光荣和自豪的是，毛主席亲自领导我们胜利地进行这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把一小撮反革命修正主义分子以及党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！最最敬爱的毛主席啊，是您老人家领导我国人民从灾难深重的深渊中解放出来，是您老人家的光辉思想照亮了我们社会主义革命和建设的光辉道路，使我们能够识别一切妖魔鬼怪。我们向您老人家保证：谁胆敢反对毛泽东思想，我们就叫他灭亡！
    打倒中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！
    誓死保卫毛主席！
    誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！
                                        （新华社上海四日电）
