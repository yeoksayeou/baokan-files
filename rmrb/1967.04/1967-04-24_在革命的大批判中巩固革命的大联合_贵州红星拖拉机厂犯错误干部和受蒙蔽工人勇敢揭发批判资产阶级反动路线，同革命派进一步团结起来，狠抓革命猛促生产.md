The proletarian revolutionary forces of the Red Star Tractor Factory in Guizhou, in their great criticism of the capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary line they represent, have further consolidated the great unity of the revolution and expanded the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces by closely linking the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of the Red Star Tractor Factory had already achieved great unity in late January this year. However, due to the lingering influence of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were still stirring up trouble in secret. As a result, there was still a significant gap between the revolutionary workers and those who had been deceived. Some cadres, who had to varying degrees implemented the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, were hesitant and dared not boldly join the revolution. These situations hindered the further consolidation of the great unity of the revolution and the expansion of the revolutionary forces, affecting the efforts to seize the revolution and promote production.

After the nationwide call to launch a total offensive against the capitalist-roader in chief within the Party and the reactionary line he represents, the factory's provisional revolutionary committee firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. They mobilized all revolutionary workers in the factory to expose, criticize, and fight against the capitalist-roader in chief within the Party, the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the factory, and the reactionary line they persistently advocate. Over the course of half a month, they held five or six factory-wide criticism meetings, and each workshop and department also held denunciation meetings. At these meetings, many deceived workers actively spoke out. Some revolutionary workers voluntarily gave their speaking opportunities to their deceived comrades, deeply touching them. They angrily denounced the harm caused by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the poisonous weed "Cultivation." The exposure and denunciations by the deceived workers helped the revolutionary workers see more clearly the evil nature of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and recognize that their deceived comrades were also victims of this reactionary line.

After several large and small criticism meetings, the opposition and isolation caused by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie among the workers were greatly reduced. The revolutionary workers and the deceived workers further united, directing their struggle against the common enemy.

The great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the capitalist-roader in chief within the Party and the reactionary line he represents also provided opportunities and conditions for some cadres who had made various degrees of mistakes to join the revolution. These cadres participated in the factory-wide criticism meetings and mid-level cadre meetings, focusing on exposing and denouncing the reactionary line's evil practice of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" in cadre issues. Through exposure and criticism, many cadres realized that the past opposition between cadres and revolutionary forces was not the fault of the revolutionary forces but was entirely the doing of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the criticism meetings, many cadres eagerly spoke out, determined to better arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, correct their mistakes, and stand with the revolutionary forces, concentrating their firepower to thoroughly overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The actions of the cadres were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary workers.

In the great criticism of the capitalist-roader in chief within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the factory, the great unity of the revolution in the Red Star Tractor Factory was further consolidated. Deceived workers and cadres who had made mistakes flocked to join the revolutionary forces, with many actively applying to join revolutionary mass organizations. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory became more isolated. The broad revolutionary workers were full of spirit, seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production, presenting a vibrant new scene throughout the factory.

    在革命的大批判中巩固革命的大联合
    贵州红星拖拉机厂犯错误干部和受蒙蔽工人勇敢揭发批判资产阶级反动路线，同革命派进一步团结起来，狠抓革命猛促生产
    据新华社贵阳二十三日电　贵州红星拖拉机厂无产阶级革命派，在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线展开的大批判中，紧密结合本厂的斗批改，进一步巩固了革命的大联合，壮大了无产阶级革命派队伍。
    红星拖拉机厂无产阶级革命派，在今年一月下旬就进行了大联合。但是，由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒没有彻底肃清，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还在暗地里煽风点火，因此革命派工人和受蒙蔽的工人之间仍然隔阂很大。一些不同程度地执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，怕字当头，不敢大胆起来革命。这些情况妨碍了革命的大联合的进一步巩固和革命派队伍的进一步壮大，给抓革命、促生产带来了一定影响。
    在全国吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他所代表的资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的进军号以后，这个厂的临时革命委员会紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，动员全厂革命职工向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，向本厂党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，向他们所坚持的资产阶级反动路线，进行大揭露，大批判，大斗争。半个月内，连续举行了五、六次全厂性的批判大会，各车间、科室也分别举行了声讨集会。在这些会上，许多受蒙蔽的职工积极发言。一些革命派职工主动把发言的机会让给受蒙蔽的同志，使他们深受感动。他们愤怒地控诉了资产阶级反动路线及大毒草《修养》对他们的毒害。受蒙蔽的职工的揭发控诉，使革命派职工更加看清了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，认识到受蒙蔽的同志也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。
    经过连续多次大大小小的批判会后，资产阶级反动路线在职工群众间造成的对立和隔阂大大消除了，革命派职工和受蒙蔽职工，进一步团结起来，把斗争矛头指向共同敌人。
    对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线的大揭露、大批判、大斗争，也给一些犯有不同程度错误的干部起来革命提供了机会和条件。这些干部参加了全厂性的批判大会和中层干部会，着重揭发和控诉了资产阶级反动路线在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪恶。通过揭露和批判，使许多干部认识到，过去造成干部和革命派对立，一点也不能责怪革命派，这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一手造成的。在批判大会上，许多干部争相发言，决心要更好地用毛泽东思想武装自己，改正错误，和革命派站在一起，集中火力，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派彻底打倒。干部们的行动受到了革命派职工的热烈欢迎。
    红星拖拉机厂在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和工厂内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的大批判中，革命的大联合更加巩固。受蒙蔽的工人和犯过错误的干部纷纷向革命派靠拢，不少人积极要求参加革命群众组织。本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派更孤立了。广大革命职工意气风发，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全厂呈现出一片热气腾腾新局面。
