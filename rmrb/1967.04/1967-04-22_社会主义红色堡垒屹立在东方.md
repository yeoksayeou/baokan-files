The red socialist bastion stands in the East

	“When the rooster crows, the world turns white.” Today, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, as we launch a total assault on the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the reactionary capitalist line he represents, the revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian revolutionary Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born! This is another thunderous spring thunder from the great alliance of the revolutionary masses seizing power, another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought echoing through the skies, and a great victory for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line! We, the working class, enthusiastically hail the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee!

	The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing, signifying that the socialist red bastion, shining with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought—Beijing—stands tall in the East!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it.” Today, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have seized back the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture from a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in Beijing. In the future, we must hold power firmly and use it well. To this end, we, the working class, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use our pens as weapons, and launch a fierce attack on the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, overthrowing and exposing the reactionary capitalist line he represents and the poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought that he has meticulously cultivated, “Self-Cultivation.” We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, thoroughly smash the machine of bourgeois dictatorship represented by the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People’s Committee. We must combine the criticism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party with the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, as well as the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our own units, pushing the mass revolutionary criticism to a new high.

	The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China’s letter to revolutionary workers and cadres in all factories, mines, and enterprises across the country states: “The working class is the leading force of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country.” We, the working class, must not let down the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works actively, break down the “self” and establish the “public,” focus on the revolution, and promote production vigorously, determined to be models in all work!

	We resolutely unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, forming a solid worker-peasant alliance as the firm foundation of the revolutionary committee. We resolutely learn from the People’s Liberation Army, determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the PLA. In the great criticism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, we must promote and consolidate the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries. We must unite with all revolutionary laborers, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards, forming a mighty revolutionary army to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	On this day of universal rejoicing, we, the working class, must not forget Chairman Mao’s great teachings: “The proletariat must not only liberate itself, but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself.” We must have our hearts with the motherland and our eyes on the world, determined to fight, unite, and win with all the revolutionary people of China and the world! Look at the future globe, it will surely be a world where the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is flying everywhere!

	Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and welcome a more brilliant tomorrow!

	Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers’ Congress

    社会主义红色堡垒屹立在东方
    “一唱雄鸡天下白”。今天，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线发动总攻击的时候，革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级革命权威的北京市革命委员会诞生了！这是无产阶级革命派大联合夺权的又一声震撼世界的春雷，是毛泽东思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌，是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利！我们工人阶级最最热烈地欢呼北京市革命委员会的成立！
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，标志着北京市无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段，标志着闪烁着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的社会主义红色堡垒——北京屹立在世界的东方！
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”今天，我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，从一小撮反革命修正主义分子手里，夺回了北京市的党、政、财、文大权；今后，我们一定要掌好权，用好权。为此，我们工人阶级一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以笔作刀枪，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动猛烈的攻击，把他所代表的资产阶级反动路线和他精心炮制的反毛泽东思想的大毒草《修养》批倒、批臭！我们要彻底批判旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，彻底打碎旧北京市委、市人委这个资产阶级专政的机器。我们要把对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的批判，同对旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的批判，以及本单位的斗批改密切结合起来，把群众性的革命大批判推向一个新高潮。
    中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部的信中说：“工人阶级是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量。”我们工人阶级一定不辜负毛主席和党中央的教导，活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓做各项工作的模范！
    我们坚决同贫下中农联合起来，结成巩固的工农联盟，成为革命委员会坚强可靠的基础。我们坚决向解放军学习，誓同解放军并肩战斗。我们要在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，促进和巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合。我们一定同一切革命的劳动群众，革命的知识分子，革命的干部和红卫兵小将在一起，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在万众欢庆的今天，我们工人阶级绝不忘记毛主席的伟大教导：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”我们一定要胸怀祖国，放眼世界，誓同全中国全世界革命人民战斗在一起，团结在一起，胜利在一起！试看将来的环球，必是插遍毛泽东思想伟大红旗的世界！
    让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，迎接更加光辉灿烂的明天！
            北京市革命职工代表会议
