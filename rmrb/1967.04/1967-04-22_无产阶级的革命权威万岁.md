We, the loyal Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao, with hearts filled with boundless excitement, extend our warmest congratulations to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, which was born amidst the thunderous cannon fire of the general offensive against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in the presence of our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and in the heart of the world's revolutionary people, Beijing!

The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a thunderclap in the spring of 1967, a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that knows no bounds. It declares the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's attempt to restore capitalism within the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee. This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Beijing is the birthplace of the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country, and the source of the Red Guard movement that shook the world. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital have made immortal contributions in this unprecedented great revolution in human history. The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee sets a new example for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses nationwide and for seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power." The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee used their usurped power in the Party, government, finance, and culture to push for the restoration of capitalism. They wielded the big sticks of "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism" to fiercely attack the broad revolutionary masses in their study of Mao Zedong Thought. They used the despicable tactics of granting official positions and bribes to buy and recruit a group of people, forming a clique of loyal dogs, turning Beijing into an "independent kingdom" where water could not seep in and needles could not be inserted.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to expose this group of power-hungry individuals. In June 1966, the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee was reorganized. Later, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we repelled the counter-attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line time and again, pushing the revolutionary struggle to smash the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee forward.

Today, the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital have established a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ, achieving a decisive victory in the struggle to seize power from the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Municipal Party Committee. However, the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is only the first step of a long march. The work ahead is even greater, and the tasks are even more arduous. We must not rest on our past achievements, become complacent in the midst of victory, and forget the heavy responsibility bestowed upon us by history. We must not be overwhelmed by routine work, lose our bearings, and neglect the study of Chairman Mao's works. We must not confuse friends and foes, engage in unprincipled "internal wars," and divert the direction of the struggle.

At present, class struggle is still raging fiercely. We must remain highly vigilant, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to put politics in command, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must take the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee as a new starting point for battle, fully utilize the authority and power of the Revolutionary Committee, organize a vast revolutionary army, thoroughly expose the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in pushing counter-revolutionary revisionism, and eliminate the poison they have spread, ensuring that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever flies high in the capital.

    无产阶级的革命权威万岁
    我们，毛主席的忠诚的红小兵，以无限激动的心情，最热烈祝贺北京市革命委员会在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的隆隆炮声中，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席身边，在世界革命人民的心脏北京庄严地诞生！
    北京市革命委员会的成立是一九六七年春天的一声惊雷，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌。它宣告了旧北京市委、市人委一小撮反革命修正主义分子复辟阴谋的彻底破产。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    北京是全国第一张马列主义大字报的出生地，是震撼世界的红卫兵运动的发源地。首都的无产阶级革命派在这场人类历史上空前的大革命中立下了不朽的功勋。北京市革命委员会的成立，为全国的无产阶级革命派的大联合和夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，又树立了一个新的范例。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”旧北京市委、市人委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们窃踞的党、政、财、文大权，大搞资本主义复辟，挥舞“简单化”、“庸俗化”和“实用主义”等等大棒，疯狂地攻击广大革命群众学习毛泽东思想；他们用封官许愿、招降纳叛等等卑鄙手段，收买拉拢一帮人，结成死党，充当他们的忠实走狗，把北京市弄成一个水泼不进、针插不进的“独立王国”。毛主席和党中央发动广大革命群众，把这一伙个人野心家揪了出来，去年六月三日，改组了旧北京市委。以后，又是我们伟大领袖毛主席领导我们击溃了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的反扑，把摧毁旧北京市委的革命斗争推向前进。
    今天，首都无产阶级革命派建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，向旧市委反革命修正主义集团的夺权斗争，取得了决定性的胜利。但是，革命委员会的成立，只是万里长征走完了第一步，以后的工作更伟大，任务更艰巨。我们决不能躺在过去的功劳上，在一片凯歌声中飘飘然起来，忘记了历史赋予我们的重任；决不能成天沉湎在事务工作中，弄得晕头转向，把毛主席著作的学习搁在一边；决不能不分敌我，大打无原则的“内战”，转移了斗争的大方向。
    当前，阶级斗争仍在激烈地进行，我们务必保持高度的警惕，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我们要以北京市革命委员会成立为新的战斗起点，充分利用革命委员会的权威力量，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，彻底清算党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行反革命修正主义的罪行，肃清他们散布的流毒，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远飘扬在首都上空。
