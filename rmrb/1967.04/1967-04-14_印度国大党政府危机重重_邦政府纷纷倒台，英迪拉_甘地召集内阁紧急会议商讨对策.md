In the face of the storm of resistance from the Indian people, the contradictions within the ruling Indian National Congress Party have become increasingly sharp, and its reactionary ruling position has become increasingly unstable.

Recently, in the centrally administered territory of Pondicherry, as well as in the newly established states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, some members of the Indian National Congress have broken away from the party, causing the local governments it controlled to collapse.

The collapse of the Indian National Congress government in Uttar Pradesh on April 1st dealt a heavy blow to the party's rule. This, the largest state in the country, is considered a "stronghold" of the Indian National Congress and the birthplace of three prime ministers since India's independence—Nehru, Shastri, and Indira Gandhi. Last year, the people of this state launched a massive struggle for survival and against tyranny. After the February elections this year, the Indian National Congress only secured a narrow majority in the state legislature. On April 1st, about twenty members of the Indian National Congress announced their withdrawal from the party, formed a new party, and cooperated with the opposition, causing the Indian National Congress government to fall.

Thus, the governments of the northern states of India have all fallen out of the hands of the Indian National Congress and into the hands of the opposition. The bureaucrats of the Indian National Congress are now worried that similar situations may soon arise in the three other states where the party holds a narrow majority (Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Mysore).

Currently, although the collapse of Indian National Congress governments has only occurred within the states, it has seriously threatened the central government. Indira Gandhi returned to New Delhi from Uttar Pradesh in the evening of April 1st and immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss countermeasures. The meeting continued until late at night. It is reported that Indira Gandhi's plan to increase the number of government members has been postponed due to the political crisis.

    印度国大党政府危机重重
    邦政府纷纷倒台，英迪拉·甘地召集内阁紧急会议商讨对策
    新华社讯　新德里消息：在印度人民反抗风暴的冲击下，印度执政党国大党内部矛盾愈来愈激化，它的反动统治地位愈来愈不稳。
    最近，在印度中央直属领地本地治里，在新建的哈里亚纳邦和北方邦，国大党的一些议员脱离了国大党，它控制的地方政府因而倒了台。
    四月一日发生的北方邦国大党政府倒台的事件，沉重地打击了国大党的统治。这个全国最大的邦被认为是国大党的“坚强堡垒”，是印度独立后三个总理——尼赫鲁、夏斯特里、英迪拉·甘地——的故乡。去年，这个邦的广大人民开展了规模宏大的争生存、反暴政斗争。今年二月的大选以后，国大党在这个邦议会中只取得了微弱的多数。一日，大约二十名国大党议员宣布退出国大党，成立新党并同反对党合作，使国大党政府倒了台。
    这样，印度北部各邦政府已经都脱离了印度国大党的掌握而落入反对党的手中。国大党的官僚们现在担心，在这个党占有微弱多数的另外三个邦（阿萨姆、安得拉、迈索尔），不久也可能出现类似的情况。
    目前，国大党政府倒台的事件虽然还只是在各邦内发生，但是已经严重地威胁到中央政府。英迪拉·甘地一日晚间从北方邦回到新德里，马上紧急召开内阁阁员会议来研究对策，会议一直开到深夜。据报道，英迪拉·甘地拟订的增加政府成员的一项计划也因为政治危机而被迫搁置。
