The people of the liberation zones in South Vietnam, with one hand holding a gun and the other a plow, are fighting against the enemy while bravely defending the liberation zones and actively developing production.

Last year, U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam used all kinds of barbaric methods, including indiscriminate bombing, spreading poison, and destroying villages, in an attempt to implement its so-called "pacification" plan. However, its schemes were shamefully defeated in the face of the brave and tenacious South Vietnamese people.

The U.S. aggressors dropped tens of thousands of tons of bombs and fired three hundred thousand shells on the small area of Go Chien, which covers only one hundred square kilometers and has a population of only twenty thousand.

However, the heroic people of Go Chien and the guerrilla forces not only smashed the enemy's repeated "sweeping" operations but also, in the intervals between battles, did everything possible to restore production and replant various crops. By the end of last October, the people of the entire county had planted most of the arable land. Last year, the people of Go Chien County fought while producing, and many outstanding production units and individuals emerged.

In many other places, the people and guerrilla forces together fought and thwarted the enemy's plots to loot crops and sabotage production. In one instance, the people of Thap De Commune in Long An Province fought against the enemy and stopped more than ten of the enemy's armored vehicles from destroying crops.

To adapt to the fighting environment, the people in the liberation zones dug air-raid shelters by the fields. When they couldn't work during the day, they worked at night. Many places also dug cow shelters and trained the cattle to hide from enemy air raids when the alarm sounded.

The people of a certain commune in Tien Giang Province, due to their good air-raid defense work, withstood more than a thousand enemy air raids over eight months and ensured continuous production on seven hundred and twenty hectares of land.

The people in the liberation zones, with indomitable spirit, tenaciously carried out production on fields where the enemy had spread chemical poisons. In one commune in Tien Giang Province, after the enemy spread chemical poisons and destroyed sixteen hectares of newly planted rice fields, the local people immediately replanted and even planted an additional seventy-five hectares.

While defeating the enemy's sabotage schemes, the people in the liberation zones strove to improve agricultural production techniques, repaired water conservancy projects, increased the area of double cropping, and actively reclaimed land, achieving development in agricultural production.

### 同敌人“三光”政策作斗争  解放区人民顽强地发展生产

    同敌人“三光”政策作斗争
    解放区人民顽强地发展生产
    越南南方解放区人民，一手拿枪，一手扶犁，同敌人进行斗争，英勇地保卫了解放区，同时积极发展了生产。
    去年，美帝国主义在南越向解放区用尽包括狂轰滥炸、撒放毒药、摧毁村庄等各种野蛮手段，妄图实现它的所谓“绥靖”计划。但是它的阴谋在英勇顽强的南越人民面前，遭到了可耻的破产。
    美国侵略者对面积仅有一百平方公里、人口只有两万的古芝，投下了成万吨炸弹，发射了三十万发炮弹。
    但是，英雄的古芝人民和游击队，不仅粉碎了敌人的各次“扫荡”，而且在战斗的空隙中，千方百计恢复生产，补种各种作物。到去年十月底，古芝全县人民已把大部分耕地都种上。去年，古芝县人民一边战斗，一边生产，涌现了许多优秀生产单位和个人。
    在其他许多地方，人民和游击队一起战斗，粉碎了敌人抢劫庄稼、破坏生产阴谋。在隆安省的上德和乡人民有一次同敌人展开斗争，阻住了敌人的十多辆装甲车破坏庄稼。
    为了适应战斗的环境，解放区人民都在田边挖掘防空洞。有时白天不能干活，就夜里干。许多地方还挖掘了藏牛洞，并训练耕牛在发生警报时懂得躲避敌机的袭击。
    堤岸省某乡人民由于防空工作做得好，顶住了敌人去年八个月间的一千多次空袭，保证了在七百二十公顷的土地上持续进行生产。
    解放区人民还以坚韧不拔的精神，顽强地在敌人撒放过化学毒药的田野上进行生产。在堤岸省的一个乡，有一次敌人撒放化学毒药，毁坏了十六公顷刚插完秧的稻田，当地人民立即又重新栽插，并比原来多插了七十五公顷。
    解放区人民在战胜敌人的破坏阴谋的同时，努力改进农业生产技术，大修水利，增加复种面积和积极开荒，使农业生产获得了发展。
