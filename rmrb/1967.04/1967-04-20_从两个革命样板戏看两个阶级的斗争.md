Chairman Mao teaches us: "In order to overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to realize his wild ambition to usurp the Party and the state, has long extended his black hand into the ideological realm, supporting a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xian Yan, controlling the literary and artistic circles, and promoting a long, deep, thick, and black counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line to oppose Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They have made the literary and artistic circles a battlefield for preparing public opinion to restore capitalism.

The old Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe was directly controlled by the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and was an important stronghold. Here, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has been fiercely waged.

Since 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing has directly led the revision of the two revolutionary model operas, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Harbor," by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe. A struggle for power in the ideological realm has begun! This is a sharp and fierce class struggle! A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" have, in order to maintain the positions of feudalism and capitalism, used every possible means to resist and oppose Comrade Jiang Qing's correct opinions. They have constantly carried out sabotage and disruption, and even attempted to lead modern operas down the evil path of serving bourgeois politics. Their backer is the number one capitalist-roader within the Party.

The Peking Opera "The Harbor" is adapted from the Huiju Opera "Morning at the Harbor." In 1962, Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call to "never forget class struggle." "Morning at the Harbor" achieved certain successes in conducting class struggle education; at the same time, it had many problems that needed further revision. In 1964, after seeing "Morning at the Harbor," the number one capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao's great directive. He maliciously proposed that the play should "cultivate successors." What "cultivating successors" means is to make the play focus on the backward youth Yu Baochang (who is now Xiaoqiang Han in the play), to expose the "dark side," and to depict the "intermediate characters"!

In "The Harbor," there was a scene designed around the "lever," which depicted the historical struggle of the dock workers and conducted class struggle education for the audience. This Khrushchev of China, however, seized upon the lever, using it as an excuse to spout black words, viciously attacking and slandering the working class. He said: At that time, the dock workers went on strike, and their lives were difficult. The underground party organized a sum of money to distribute relief funds every day, but they could never distribute it all. Later, they found that many people were double-dipping and impersonating others to receive the funds. So, they came up with a method: distribute funds based on the lever. Comrades, in his eyes, the working class has no revolutionary nature? No advanced nature? In his eyes, our working class has all become a group of "ignorant" and "selfish" "mob"! This is a great slander against our great working class. He shamelessly portrayed himself as a "savior"! Boasting that he was the leader of the strike, the "old revolutionary"! These black words are a great exposure of his filthy bourgeois soul! It is a great exposure of his fake revolutionary, counter-revolutionary face! His intention is to make this play propagate his reactionary theories and decadent philosophy! We will not agree to this in a million ways.

Comrade Ke Qingshi paid great attention to and cared deeply about the first appearance of socialist-era dock workers on the opera stage. Before Comrade Ke Qingshi passed away, he repeatedly instructed that this play must be well done. Comrade Jiang Qing also gave this play, which praises the working class in the socialist era, a high evaluation. She clearly pointed out: This play should not appear in the guise of depicting "intermediate characters." It should depict the heroic spirit of the dock workers standing on the dock, cherishing the motherland, and looking to the world. It should depict the great aspirations of internationalism and patriotism of the Chinese working class. Comrade Jiang Qing's opinion is to create a great image of the working class heroes, to inspire the people, to educate the people, and to make greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Comrade Jiang Qing has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and pointed out the direction for us to advance.

However, the class enemies have been deceitful and stubbornly resisted. A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic circles have infiltrated the "The Harbor" troupe with their own people, vigorously implementing the black directives of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and carrying out splittist activities within the troupe. They also wrote a so-called play depicting dock workers, which featured seven or eight negative characters and focused on the dark side, resulting in a failure and delaying the rehearsal time by four months. The director of "The Harbor" also, according to the black directives of the Khrushchev of China, focused on the backward characters, specially designing the "Storm Chasing Boat" scene, using ghostly appearances and other methods to greatly exaggerate the spiritual split of this backward youth. He proudly said: "Being able to retain the 'sitting in the palace' segment of singing from 'The Four Generals' is a great achievement of 'The Harbor'!" Comrades, think about what kind of trick these people have played according to the black directives of their backer! What kind of class tool do they want to turn Peking Opera into? Due to the correct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, the strong support of the revolutionary dock workers, and the struggle and efforts of revolutionary comrades within the troupe, "The Harbor" finally broke through the sabotage and obstruction of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles and their backer, established the correct theme, and presented a completely new look. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" similarly became a revolutionary model opera in the fierce struggle between the two lines. During the modern Peking Opera observation performance in 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan, former deputy minister of the old Propaganda Department, instructed his henchmen to write articles viciously attacking "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," maliciously proposing that the negative character of the bandit Seat Mountain Tiger should be highlighted, and that the heroic character Yang Zhirong should be depicted with "gangster-like" qualities. This proposal essentially opposed highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, opposed creating proletarian heroic images, and opposed our revolutionary heroes appearing on the stage. They were afraid that the literary and artistic works of the exploiting classes would be cut off! This is the tune of the Khrushchev of China!

At this time, Comrade Jiang Qing raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, encouraging us to continue the fight, to create literary and artistic works that protect the socialist economic base. We must strive for perfection, letting the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the true creators of history, firmly stand on the stage. However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" jumped out again to attack, saying: "When will 'Shan Hai Jing' be able to meet the audience?" ("Shan" refers to "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "Hai" refers to "The Harbor"). The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Xinfan was even more arrogant, viciously attacking the creation of revolutionary modern operas as "wasting people's efforts and energy" and "wasting actors' youth." Comrade Jiang Qing insisted on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, bravely fighting in the midst of the class enemies' slander and abuse. She encouraged the revolutionary comrades in the troupe: Now, the oppressed people all over the world are eagerly awaiting our revolutionary modern operas. We must have great aspirations, think for the people of the whole country, and think for the oppressed people all over the world. Who gave them such great courage? Who supported them? It is the backer of the revisionist literary and artistic line, the Khrushchev of China. This guy is the chief culprit in sabotaging the revolutionary model operas! We must uproot the grass and capture the ringleader, overthrow him, and smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line! Create a new world of literary and artistic works in bright red Mao Zedong Thought!

    从两个革命样板戏看两个阶级的斗争
    上海革命京剧文工团革命派战士
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了实现他篡党篡国的狼子野心，长期以来，把黑手伸进意识形态领域，支持陆定一、周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，控制着文艺界，推行了一条又长又深又粗又黑的反革命修正主义文艺路线，和毛主席的文艺路线相对抗，把文艺界作为复辟资本主义制造舆论准备的阵地。
    旧上海京剧院就是被反革命修正主义文艺黑线直接控制的一个重要据点。在这里，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一直激烈地进行着。
    一九六四年以来，江青同志直接领导了上海京剧院《智取威虎山》和《海港》两出革命样板戏的加工工作。一场意识形态领域内的夺权斗争就此开始了！这是一场尖锐激烈的阶级斗争！党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，为了保持封建主义、资本主义的阵地，千方百计地抵制和反对江青同志的正确意见，不断地进行破坏和捣乱，并妄想把现代戏引上为资产阶级政治服务的邪路。他们的总后台就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    京剧《海港》是根据淮剧《海港的早晨》改编的。一九六二年，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。《海港的早晨》在进行阶级斗争教育方面，取得一定成绩；同时，它还存在不少问题，有待进一步加工。一九六四年，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派看了《海港的早晨》后，公然对抗毛主席的伟大指示，他别有用心地提出，这出戏要写“培养接班人”。什么“培养接班人”？就是让这出戏着重去表现戏里的落后青年余宝昌（就是现在戏里的韩小强），就是去揭露“阴暗面”，就是去表现“中间人物”！
    《海港》中曾设计了“杠棒”一个场面，围绕杠棒表现码头工人斗争的历史，对观众进行阶级斗争教育。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫却抓住杠棒，借题发挥，大讲黑话，对工人阶级进行恶毒攻击和诽谤。他说：当时码头工人罢工，生活困难，地下党筹划了一批钱每天发救济金，但总发不完，后来发现原来很多人重领、冒领，于是就想了个办法，凭杠棒领钱。同志们，在他眼里，工人阶级哪里有什么革命性？先进性？在他眼里，我们工人阶级全变成了一群“愚昧”“自私”的“群氓”！这是对我们伟大的工人阶级的极大的诬蔑。他又恬不知耻地把自己标榜成“救世主”！吹嘘自己是领导罢工的
  “老革命”！这些黑话，是他那肮脏的资产阶级灵魂的大暴露！是他假革命、反革命面目的大暴露！他的用心，就是让这出戏宣扬他的反动理论和腐朽哲学！我们一千万个不答应。
    柯庆施同志对于社会主义时代的码头工人第一次出现在戏曲舞台上，非常重视，十分关心。柯庆施同志逝世前，还谆谆嘱咐一定要把这出戏搞好。江青同志对这出歌颂社会主义时代工人阶级的戏也给以很高的评价。她明确指出：这出戏不能以写“中间人物”的面貌出现，要表现码头工人立足码头、胸怀祖国、放眼世界的英雄气概，要表现中国工人阶级国际主义、爱国主义的豪情壮志。江青同志的意见，就是要塑造高大的工人阶级英雄形象，鼓舞人民，教育人民，为中国革命和世界革命做出更大的贡献。江青同志高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为我们指明了前进方向。
    但是，阶级敌人却阳奉阴违，拚命对抗。窃踞文艺界领导的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在《海港》剧组安插亲信，竭力贯彻党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑指示，在剧组里大搞分裂活动，他们也写了一个所谓表现码头工人的戏，这个戏写了七、八个反面人物，大写阴暗面，结果成为废品，使排戏时间拖迟四个月。导演《海港》的那个家伙也根据中国的赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，在落后人物身上大做文章，专门设计“风雨追舟”一场，用鬼魂出现一类的手法，大肆渲染这个落后青年的精神分裂，并自鸣得意地说：“能保留下《四郎探母》‘坐宫’的一段唱腔，也是《海港》的一大功劳！”同志们想想，这伙人根据他们总后台的黑指示搞了些什么鬼名堂！他们要把京剧变成什么阶级的工具？由于江青同志的正确领导，码头革命工人的有力支持，剧组内革命同志的斗争和努力，《海港》终于冲破了文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子及他们的总后台的破坏和阻挠，确立了正确的主题，出现了崭新的面貌，这是毛主席文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    《智取威虎山》同样是在两条路线的激烈斗争中，成为革命样板戏的。一九六四年京剧现代戏观摩演出时，反革命修正主义分子、旧中宣部副部长林默涵就指使其爪牙写文章恶毒攻击《智取威虎山》，别有用心地提出应该突出土匪座山雕的反面形象，要渲染英雄人物杨子荣的“江湖气”。这种主张实质上是反对突出毛泽东思想，反对塑造无产阶级英雄形象，反对我们的革命英雄人物登上艺术舞台，就是怕剥削阶级的文艺断了香火！这就是中国的赫鲁晓夫的调子！
    就在这时，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，鼓励我们继续战斗，要创造保护社会主义经济基础的文艺。要精益求精，让历史的真正创造者工农兵英雄形象牢牢树立在舞台上。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，又跳出来攻击。说什么：“‘山海经’谈到何时才能和观众见面？”（“山”指《智取威虎山》，“海”指《海港》）反革命修正主义分子周信芳更狂妄之极，恶毒攻击搞革命现代戏是“劳民伤财”，“糟踏演员青春”。江青同志坚持毛主席的革命文艺路线，在阶级敌人的诽谤谩骂中英勇战斗。她鼓励剧组的革命同志：现在全世界被压迫的人民，都渴望着我们的革命现代戏，我们要有雄心壮志，要替全国人民着想，要为全世界受压迫的人民着想。是谁给他们如此大的胆？是谁给他们撑腰？就是修正主义文艺路线的总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫。这个家伙，是破坏革命样板戏的罪魁祸首！斩草除根，擒贼擒王，我们必须把他打倒，把反革命修正主义文艺黑线彻底砸烂！创建一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的文艺新天地！
