The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged the strongest protest against the Indonesian reactionary regime's shooting of overseas Chinese. The Chinese people must definitely seek redress for this blood debt. The Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta has sent a telegram to express condolences to the families of the martyred overseas Chinese.

	New China News Agency, April 11th: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 8, expressing great indignation over the bloody massacre of innocent overseas Chinese by the military authorities of Sidoarjo in East Java, and lodged the strongest and most severe protest to the Indonesian government.

	The note said: "The Sidoarjo base command has brazenly implemented anti-Chinese and discriminatory policies, forcibly seized Chinese shops, cut off water and electricity to Chinese residences, and illegally arrested 24 innocent overseas Chinese on April 4 and 5. On April 6, when the families of the detained overseas Chinese went to meet with the base commander as agreed to negotiate and visit their detained relatives, the base commander not only delayed the meeting but also, when the families of the detained overseas Chinese approached to inquire, suddenly dispatched fully armed troops who had been pre-positioned to indiscriminately open fire on the unarmed overseas Chinese families. Huang Jianmin was hit three times in the chest and died on the spot, while Yang Jingrong and Chen Yongzhen were seriously injured. Even two overseas Chinese who rushed forward to rescue them were beaten unconscious and dragged into prison after being severely beaten."

	The note pointed out: "It is clear that the above bloody massacre was deliberately planned and meticulously orchestrated by the Indonesian government. The Chinese Embassy has repeatedly protested the serious incidents of persecution of overseas Chinese in various parts of East Java and demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop these actions. We also requested to send consular officials to East Java to inspect the situation of overseas Chinese and express condolences to the persecuted overseas Chinese. However, you have obstructed our legitimate demands on all fronts and instead, escalated the situation by continuously creating new anti-Chinese and discriminatory incidents in East Java. Since March 11, there have been multiple incidents of shooting and killing overseas Chinese in Malang, Cirebon, and other places. Now, under the personal arrangement and instruction of the commander of the 083 Military District in East Java, Mujaidi, Sidoarjo has witnessed a horrifying massacre. In the face of these ironclad facts, you cannot escape this guilt and will inevitably face the just condemnation of the people of the world."

	The note emphasized: "The struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese to safeguard their legitimate rights and fight for survival is completely just. Their demands to the Indonesian government are very reasonable. You have not only ignored the legitimate demands of the broad masses of overseas Chinese but have also escalated the situation by using fascist bloody methods to publicly massacre innocent overseas Chinese. We warn the Indonesian government that 'where there is oppression, there is resistance.' The more you persecute overseas Chinese, the more widespread and intense their resistance will be. The broad masses of overseas Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are absolutely unyielding and fearless. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the savage atrocities of killing overseas Chinese. Blood debts must be repaid with blood."

	The note firmly demands that the Indonesian government immediately apologize publicly for the above bloody massacre, severely punish the perpetrators and their instigators, compensate the families of the deceased overseas Chinese, bear the medical expenses of the injured overseas Chinese, immediately release all detained overseas Chinese, and revoke the four anti-Chinese and discriminatory decrees in East Java. The Embassy has decided to immediately send consular officials to attend the funeral and express condolences to the families of the deceased and other affected overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government must promptly provide a satisfactory response to the above serious demands.

	New China News Agency, April 11th: The Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta sent a telegram on April 8 to the Chinese Association of Sidoarjo in East Java and to all patriotic overseas Chinese, expressing the deepest condolences and warmest sympathies to the families of the overseas Chinese who were brutally shot by the Indonesian reactionary military authorities, as well as to the injured overseas Chinese.

	The telegram said: "We were shocked to learn that the reactionary military authorities of Sidoarjo committed a horrifying massacre on April 6, brazenly shooting and killing overseas Chinese Huang Jianmin, and injuring overseas Chinese Yang Jingrong and Chen Yongzhen. We express the greatest indignation and strongest protest against this heinous crime of the Indonesian reactionaries, and offer the deepest condolences to the martyr Huang Jianmin, and express the warmest sympathies to the families of the martyr and the injured overseas Chinese."

	The telegram said: "Huang Jianmin, the martyr, fearlessly fought against oppression to defend the dignity of the nation and the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese, and he is truly a good student of Chairman Mao and a good son of the motherland. He 'died for the people's interests, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai.'"

	The telegram said: "Your struggle against oppression and for survival is completely just. Your heroic struggle has set another example for the broad masses of persecuted overseas Chinese. We firmly support you, and the 700 million people of the motherland firmly support you. The savage massacre by the Indonesian reactionaries will absolutely not intimidate the patriotic overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Their anti-Chinese and discriminatory evil deeds are doomed to fail, and the blood debt they owe will definitely be repaid with blood. They will not have a good ending!"

	The telegram concluded by expressing the belief that the overseas Chinese will turn their grief into strength, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "with determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

    我驻印尼大使馆最严重抗议印尼反动当局枪杀华侨
    中国人民一定要讨还这笔血债
    我驻雅加达总领事馆致电慰问被害的华侨烈士家属
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆八日照会印度尼西亚外交部，对东爪哇西都文罗市军政当局悍然制造屠杀无辜华侨的流血惨案表示极大愤慨，并向印度尼西亚政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：“西都文罗市基地司令部肆无忌惮地推行反华、排华法令，强占华商店面，断绝华侨住宅水电，并于四月四日和五日非法逮捕无辜华侨二十四人。四月六日，当难侨家属按照约定时间前往会见基地司令进行交涉，并探视被捕亲人时，该基地司令不仅违约迟迟不予接见，反而当难侨家属赶前询问时，突然出动预先布置好的全副武装的军队，向手无寸铁的难侨家属疯狂开枪扫射，华侨黄健民胸部连中三弹，当场惨死，杨荆荣和陈永振中弹重伤，甚至连上前抢救他们的两名华侨，也在遭到毒打晕厥后，被拖进监狱。”
    照会指出：“十分明显，上述流血惨案完全是印度尼西亚政府蓄意预谋和精心策划的。中国大使馆曾就东爪哇各地连续发生的迫害华侨的严重事件多次提出抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府迅速予以制止，并提出派遣领事官员赴东爪哇各地视察侨情，慰问受难华侨，而你们一面对大使馆的严正要求百般阻挠，一面变本加厉，在东爪哇各地连续制造新的反华、排华事件。自三月十一日以来，先后在玛琅、谏义里等地多次发生开枪打伤华侨并逼死人命的更为严重的事件。现在，在东爪哇○八三军分区司令慕雅迪的亲自布置和指使下，西都文罗市又发生了骇人听闻的杀人惨案。在这些铁的事实面前，你们是绝对逃脱不了这种罪责的，并且必将受到全世界人民的正义谴责。”
    照会强调指出：“广大华侨为了维护正当权益和争取生存而进行的反迫害斗争，完全是正义的。他们向印度尼西亚政府提出的要求是十分合理的。你们对广大华侨的正当要求，不仅置之不理，反而变本加厉地使出法西斯血腥手段，公然惨杀无辜华侨。我们正告印度尼西亚政府‘那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。’你们对华侨的迫害愈加疯狂，就必然激起华侨更广泛更剧烈的反抗。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨是绝对压不服、吓不倒的。中国人民对残杀华侨的野蛮暴行，是绝对不能容忍的。血债一定要用血来还。”
    照会坚决要求印尼政府就上述流血惨案，立即公开道歉，严惩凶手及其主使人，抚恤死难华侨的家属，负担受伤华侨的医药费用，立即释放被捕的全部华侨，撤销东爪哇四项反华、排华法令。大使馆决定立即派领事官员前往参加葬礼，并慰问死难者家属及其他受害华侨。印度尼西亚政府必须对上述各项严正要求，迅速作出圆满的答复。
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国驻雅加达总领事馆四月八日致电东爪哇西都文罗中华会馆并转全体爱国侨胞，对被印度尼西亚反动军政当局野蛮枪杀的侨胞、烈士家属和受伤侨胞表示最深切的哀悼和最亲切的慰问。
    电报说，惊悉西都文罗反动军政当局，在四月六日制造了骇人听闻的流血惨案，悍然枪杀侨胞黄健民、枪伤侨胞杨荆荣、陈永振，我们对印度尼西亚反动派的这一滔天罪行表示极大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议，对黄健民烈士致以最深切的哀悼，对烈士家属和受伤侨胞表示最亲切的慰问。
    电报说，黄健民烈士为了维护民族的尊严和华侨的正当权益，不畏强暴，英勇牺牲，他不愧为毛主席的好学生，祖国人民的好儿子。他“是为人民利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的”。
    电报说，你们同印尼反动派所进行的反迫害、争生存的斗争完全是正义的，你们的英勇斗争为广大受迫害的侨胞树立了又一榜样。我们坚决支持你们，七亿祖国人民坚决支持你们。印尼反动派的野蛮屠杀绝对吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国侨胞，他们的反华排华的罪恶勾当是注定要失败的，他们欠下的血债是一定要用血来偿还的，他们是绝不会有好下场的！
    电报最后表示坚信，侨胞们一定会化悲愤为力量，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
