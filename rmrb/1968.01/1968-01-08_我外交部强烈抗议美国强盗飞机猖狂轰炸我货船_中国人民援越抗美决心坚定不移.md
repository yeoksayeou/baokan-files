	China's Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests U.S. Warplanes' Brazen Bombing of Chinese Cargo Ship
	China's People's Determination to Aid Vietnam and Fight the U.S. Remains Unshakable

	New China News Agency, January 7th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on January 7th, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists' despicable act of sending warplanes to brazenly bomb the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158" docked at the port of Cam Ranh in Vietnam. The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' warplanes bombing Chinese cargo ships can only arouse greater indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese people will stand more firmly than ever alongside the Vietnamese people, delivering heavier and heavier blows to U.S. imperialism until final victory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

	January 7, 1968

	On the morning of January 3rd, U.S. warplanes brazenly bombed the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158" docked at the port of Cam Ranh in Vietnam, injuring many of our crew members and severely damaging the ship. This is a serious provocation following the U.S. imperialists' bombing and attack on our "Hongqi 154" on November 25th last year. The Chinese government and people strongly protest against this bandit-like behavior of U.S. imperialism.

	In less than two months, U.S. warplanes have twice carried out blatant bombing attacks on Chinese cargo ships flying the national flag of the People's Republic of China. This is not accidental. U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats in its aggression against Vietnam and is now more desperate. It is now resorting to desperate measures, attempting to use the mad bombing of Chinese cargo ships to disrupt trade between China and Vietnam, obstruct Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people, and achieve the evil goal of blockading and isolating Vietnam. The repeated bombing of Chinese cargo ships by U.S. warplanes not only exposes the desperate struggle of U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam War but also further reveals the ugly face of U.S. imperialism's determination to be the enemy of the Chinese people.

	The Chinese people's determination to support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation is unshakable. "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." U.S. imperialism's attempt to use threats to stop Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people will never succeed. The bombing of Chinese cargo ships by U.S. warplanes can only arouse greater indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese people will stand more firmly than ever alongside the Vietnamese people, delivering heavier and heavier blows to U.S. imperialism until final victory.

    我外交部强烈抗议美国强盗飞机猖狂轰炸我货船
    中国人民援越抗美决心坚定不移
    新华社七日讯　中华人民共和国外交部七日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义派遣强盗飞机猖狂轰炸中国停泊在越南锦普港口的货船红旗一五八号的强盗行为。声明指出，美帝国主义的强盗飞机轰炸中国的货船，只能激起中国人民更大的愤怒，中国人民将更加坚定不移地同兄弟的越南人民并肩战斗，给美帝国主义以越来越沉重的打击，直至最后胜利。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六八年一月七日
    一月三日上午，美国强盗飞机对我停泊在越南锦普港口的货船红旗一五八号进行了猖狂轰炸，使我船员多人受伤，船身遭到严重破坏。这是美帝国主义继去年十一月二十五日轰炸袭击我红旗一五四轮后又一次严重的挑衅事件。中国政府和中国人民强烈抗议美帝国主义的这种强盗行为。
    美国强盗飞机在不到两个月的时间内，连续两次对悬有中华人民共和国国旗的中国货船进行明目张胆的轰炸袭击，绝不是偶然的。美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中遭到惨重失败，更加走投无路，它现在狗急跳墙，妄图用疯狂轰炸中国货船的手段，破坏中越两国的贸易往来，阻止中国人民对越南人民的支援，以达到封锁和孤立越南的罪恶目的。美国强盗飞机对中国货船的连续轰炸，不仅表明了美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中的绝望挣扎，同时也更加暴露了美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌的狰狞面目。
    中国人民支援越南人民抗美救国战争的决心是坚定不移的。“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方”，美帝国主义企图用威胁的手段来阻止中国人民对越南人民的支援，是永远办不到的。美帝国主义的强盗飞机轰炸中国的货船，只能激起中国人民更大的愤怒，中国人民将更加坚定不移地同兄弟的越南人民并肩战斗，给美帝国主义以越来越沉重的打击，直至最后胜利。
