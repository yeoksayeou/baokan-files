The victorious march of Mao Zedong Thought resounds across the Northwest Plateau. The Revolutionary Committee of Gansu Province is born amidst a mighty east wind. In Lanzhou, 250,000 soldiers and civilians gather to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The People's Liberation Army Lanzhou troops have established immortal achievements in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

The broad masses of soldiers and civilians are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, to strengthen the unity between the military and the people and the dictatorship of the proletariat, to smash all the plots and sabotage activities of the class enemies at home and abroad; to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 25th - Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and in the midst of the nationwide revolutionary people's march towards the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another triumphant song echoes from the Northwest Plateau of our motherland: the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee is born amidst the storm of class struggle. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Gansu Province is a strategic stronghold in the northwest of our motherland with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Thirty-three years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao led the Red Army on an unprecedented Long March of 25,000 li, trampling the snow of Min Mountains for a thousand li, breaking through the treacherous pass of La Zi Kou, and triumphantly converging in Wei Ning City, writing an immortal epic here. "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the long march, ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains are but trifles." Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and poetry have inspired the 13 million revolutionary people of Gansu Province and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the nation for decades. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has always shown great concern for the cultural revolution in Gansu Province. Chairman Mao's great concern has given the revolutionary people of Gansu Province boundless inspiration and infinite strength. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Red flags wave along the Yellow River, and triumphant songs echo beneath the Gaolan Mountains. On January 24th, the provincial capital of Lanzhou was in a state of jubilation. Twenty-five hundred thousand revolutionary masses from all fronts across the province, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army Lanzhou troops, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, faced the radiant sunrise, carrying the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing and dancing, surging from all directions towards the Panlong Road Square to celebrate the triumphant birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought.

The band played "The East is Red," and the celebration began in a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere. When the announcement of the birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee was made, the venue inside and outside erupted in thunderous applause, firecrackers burst, drums rolled, and people shouted in unison, wishing our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee signifies the complete failure of the evil plot by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Gansu to restore capitalism, marking a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province. Led by the working class, the revolutionary masses of Gansu and the broad revolutionary masses, with unyielding loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, displayed fearless revolutionary spirit, overcame countless difficulties, and fought hard. They exposed Liu Shaoqi's agents in Gansu, such as Wang Feng, and seized back the power they had usurped. The dictatorship of the proletariat in this strategic base in the northwest of our motherland, on the anti-revisionist front, has been further consolidated and strengthened after more than a year of cultural revolution.

"The unity of soldiers and civilians is like one person; see who can stand against us!" The broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army Lanzhou troops firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely responded to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and in critical moments of struggle, stood up bravely, firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses, sharing breath and destiny, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and establishing immortal achievements in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province is excellent and getting better. From the Longdong Plateau to the Hexi Corridor, from the banks of the Yellow River to the grasslands of Gannan, everywhere is a thriving revolutionary scene. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been as well-known as it is today, and the people have never been as spirited as they are today. The broad revolutionary masses are further implementing and fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, rallying their spirits, striving for the forefront, and continuing to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Xian Henghan, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration. He said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu, it is the great commander Chairman Mao who cleared the fog for us and pointed the way; it is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave us boundless wisdom and strength. All the victories we have achieved are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought!

Comrade Xian Henghan emphasized that after the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to turn the entire province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and to complete the glorious and arduous task of establishing Mao Zedong Thought, we must build the revolutionary committee, this temporary power organ, into a strong command post for establishing Mao Zedong Thought. He proposed that to achieve this, the revolutionary committee must: first, vigorously promote the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought; second, firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle, always directing the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism; third, rely on the great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses; fourth, vigorously promote the ideological revolution of the members of the revolutionary committee, and each member of the revolutionary committee must become a pioneer in establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Xian Henghan said, we must spare no effort to run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, placing the study of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, and launch a new high tide of the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the province, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, reform everything, and promote everything. He said, we must, through further deepening the revolutionary criticism, further eliminate all the revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Gansu, let the great Mao Zedong Thought take deep root in our hearts forever, and let Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line guide us to victory forever. He said, we must, without doubt, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, convey Chairman Mao's every instruction, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and every order of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to every corner of the cities and countryside across the province, and turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious revolutionary actions of the 13 million people of the province. Every piece of work carried out by the revolutionary committee must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people. Comrade Xian Henghan said, to run the revolutionary committee well, to become a pioneer in establishing Mao Zedong Thought, we must take the lead in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and in criticizing and repudiating revisionism; we must take the lead in believing in the masses, relying on the masses, adhering to the mass line, and maintaining the character of ordinary laborers; we must take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

In his speech, Comrade Xian Henghan also called on the soldiers and civilians across the province to heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, to further carry out the "support the army, love the people" movement, to strengthen the unity between the military and the people, to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, to resolutely smash all the plots and sabotage activities of the class enemies at home and abroad and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to ensure the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrades Zhang Da Zhi, Yang Jia Rui, Li Shu Mao, Gao Wei Song, and Long Bing Chu of the People's Liberation Army Lanzhou troops and the Gansu Provincial Military Region, and Comrades Zhang Zhong, Hu Ji Zong, Qiu Yu Min, and Xiao Ze Min, vice chairmen of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, attended the celebration.

Comrade Zhang Da Zhi, the commander of the Lanzhou troops, spoke on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the Lanzhou troops, expressing the warmest congratulations on the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary power. He said, we must enthusiastically respond to the battle call issued by Vice Chairman Lin, "Raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, highlight proletarian politics, learn from the Eighth Route Army, the Heroic Fourth Platoon, and Comrade Li Wen Zhong, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and under the support and help of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of the American imperialists and their running dogs, and strive for the safety of our motherland and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Hu Ji Zong, vice chairman of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary cadre, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from the Lanzhou region workers' congress, peasants' congress, higher education red guards, and middle school red guards, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, spoke one after another at the meeting, enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, take "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key, vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, further carry out the revolutionary criticism, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units, extensively and deeply carry out the "support the army, love the people" movement, further do a good job in grasping the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
