The Soviet revisionist clique, beginning from the eve of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, has been successively broadcasting a so-called retrospective of Soviet history in the form of an "Annals" television documentary. After much difficulty, they finally aired the segment covering the year 1956. This is because the 20th Congress of the CPSU was held in that year. When describing this segment of revisionist history, the Soviet revisionists have truly exhausted all their tricks. The screen showed scenes from the 20th Congress, but never once did they allow Khrushchev to appear, as if there had never been such a person. This is indeed a strange occurrence.

Who doesn't know that Khrushchev was the main figure at the 20th Congress of the CPSU? It was Khrushchev who, at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, vehemently attacked Stalin and Marxism-Leninism, spouting a series of revisionist fallacies and forming a revisionist line. The Soviet revisionist clique, led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, have been vigorously promoting the 20th Congress of the CPSU and repeatedly claiming that they adhere to the line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. However, they dare not admit that the main figure of the 20th Congress of the CPSU was Khrushchev, nor do they dare to admit that they are faithful disciples of Khrushchev. Instead, they "forget the origins of their tradition" and attempt to erase Khrushchev's name from the history of modern revisionism. This self-contradictory behavior fully reveals the embarrassment and weakness of the traitorous clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, and how difficult their days are!

Revisionists, like all decaying and reactionary forces, are always worse off with each passing generation. The revisionists of the Second International could still invoke a few so-called "theorists" as their ancestral masters. The modern revisionists, although they also have their main representatives, such as the infamous Khrushchev, cannot help but keep their distance from him because his reputation is too bad. This is the great tragedy of Khrushchev and all his old and new disciples. It clearly reflects the great failure of modern revisionism.

The "Annals" television documentary broadcast by the Soviet revisionist clique shows that Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk are trying every possible means to carry out Khrushchev's revisionism without Khrushchev. However, playing this trick will not save them. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Reactionaries who appear in disguise give people a false impression while concealing their true nature. But since they are reactionaries, they cannot completely conceal their true nature." The Soviet revisionist clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin are originally Khrushchev's accomplices. They have inherited all the legacy of Khrushchev's revisionism and have gone even further down the path of betrayal, committing even more evil deeds. Their reactionary faces have long been thoroughly exposed. It can be said that the fate of Khrushchev's successors and all their old and new disciples will not be better than Khrushchev's.

    “数典忘祖”
    苏修集团从十月革命五十周年前夕开始连续放映的所谓回顾苏联历程的《编年史》电视纪录片，经过一番难产之后，才把一九五六年的部分端了出来。这是因为在这一年曾经召开了苏共二十大。当描述修正主义的这一段丑史时，苏修集团实在是费尽了心机。银幕上出现了二十大的镜头，但却始终没有让赫鲁晓夫露面，好象压根儿就没有这么一个人。可谓怪事一桩。
    谁不知道赫鲁晓夫是苏共二十大的主角？正是赫鲁晓夫，在苏共二十大上大反斯大林，大反马克思列宁主义，抛出了一连串的修正主义谬论，形成了一套修正主义路线。以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修集团既然竭力宣扬苏共二十大，并且一再声称他们坚持执行苏共二十大的路线，但是却不敢承认苏共二十大的主角是赫鲁晓夫，不敢承认自己是赫鲁晓夫的忠实门徒，甚至“数典忘祖”，想把赫鲁晓夫这个名字从现代修正主义的历史上抹掉，这种自相矛盾的做法，充分说明勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流这一伙叛徒是何等的尴尬，何等的虚弱，他们的日子是何等的不好混啊！
    修正主义者，同一切腐朽没落的反动势力一样，总是一代不如一代。第二国际的修正主义者，还可以抬出几个所谓“理论家”，奉为自己的祖师爷。现代修正主义者，虽然也有自己的主要代表，例如臭名远扬的赫鲁晓夫，但是却因为赫鲁晓夫的名声太臭了，不能不“敬而远之”。这是赫鲁晓夫及其一切新旧门徒的大悲哀。它清楚地反映了现代修正主义的大破产。
    苏修集团放映的《编年史》电视纪录片表明，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流在千方百计地实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。但是，玩弄这一套把戏，也并不能挽救他们自己。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修集团本来就是赫鲁晓夫的同伙，他们继承了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的全部衣钵，在叛卖的道路上走得更远，干的坏事更多。他们的反动面目早已彻底暴露了。可以断言，赫鲁晓夫的继承者及其一切新旧门徒的下场决不会比赫鲁晓夫更好些。
