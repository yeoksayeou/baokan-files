Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed."

Last June, after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, we immediately launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the region. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we vigorously carried out a great criticism of the revolution, firmly directing the spearhead of the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, and firmly grasping the overall direction of this movement. However, due to the decisive victory of the struggle and the change in the status of the revolutionary factions, various contradictions within the people began to surface. For example, the relationship between the revolutionary factions and the leading cadres, the relationship among the revolutionary factions, the relationship between the revolutionary factions and the deceived masses, the relationship between the revolutionary factions and the erring cadres, and so on, all had problems. According to Chairman Mao's teaching on grasping the main contradiction, we believe that to correctly handle these contradictions, we must firmly grasp the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions and use Mao Zedong Thought to command this revolutionary army.

When we had just won the victory, we raised the battle slogan of "learning from the People's Liberation Army's glorious tradition of emphasizing politics, strengthening the ideological construction of the proletarian revolutionary factions." Immediately, we organized a series of study sessions on Chairman Mao's works, addressing various contradictions that arose during the struggle. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," military cadres, revolutionary factions, and revolutionary leading cadres combined, workers, peasants, and soldiers combined, and revolutionary factions combined with erring cadres and deceived masses in various forms. Mao Zedong Thought study classes were established from top to bottom, from cities to vast rural and pastoral areas.

Over the past few months, by persistently grasping the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions, we have not formed two major opposing factions in the Hohhot region and other regions, eliminated the interference of the extreme "leftist" trend, greatly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, developed and consolidated the great alliance of the revolution and the "three-in-one combination," ensuring that Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is implemented step by step.

Leading the Revolutionary Troops Is a Glorious Task Assigned by the Party

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our Party and state do not change color, we not only need a correct line and policy, but also need to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution."

In the process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, arming the revolutionary factions with Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously grasping their ideological construction is the most effective measure to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic decision to cultivate and train revolutionary successors. It is a matter of great importance concerning what banner this revolutionary army will hold high, what path it will take, and what ideology it will use to govern after seizing power.

According to our experience, to firmly grasp the ideological construction of the revolutionary troops, we must firmly establish two "beliefs": believe that Mao Zedong Thought can command everything, transform everything, and promote everything; believe that the broad revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao the most and can educate themselves. Only in this way can we, in the midst of countless tasks, vigorously eliminate interference and persistently lead the revolutionary factions with Mao Zedong Thought.

In the actual work process, we have encountered various obstacles. At the beginning of the seizure of power, some units' revolutionary factions could not correctly handle the deceived masses. After discovering this, we immediately pointed out seriously that the revolutionary factions must not replace policy with emotion, must not seek temporary satisfaction and lose political initiative, and must ensure that every word and deed conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, some people had difficulty understanding and said we were "rightist." We were not disturbed by these people. When there were signs of "internal strife" within the revolutionary factions, we promptly helped them launch rectification movements, fight selfishness, overcome factionalism, eliminate differences, and unite against the enemy. At this time, some people accused us of "turning the gun inward, not outward," "shifting the direction of the struggle," and so on. We were not disturbed by them either. In such circumstances, leaders must not develop a sense of fear and hesitation because someone opposes them. What are they afraid of? They are afraid of offending the revolutionary factions, afraid of losing their own prestige, afraid of being criticized, and afraid of being rebelled against. In the end, it all boils down to one sentence: the "self" is at work in their minds. In the face of these obstacles, our approach is one: firmly act according to Mao Zedong Thought and eliminate selfishness to establish public-mindedness. We deeply feel that the process of overcoming various obstacles is the process of leaders themselves eliminating selfishness to establish public-mindedness. Daring to propagate, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the greatest public-mindedness, while the opposite is the greatest selfishness. This struggle between public and private is essentially the reflection of the struggle between the two lines in our minds. When fighting against the "self," one must consciously raise the level of struggle. Only by being selfless can one truly love, and only by being fearless can one dare to stand out, propagate, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies, and dare to guide and support the masses in overcoming and resisting various erroneous words and deeds.

To do a good job of ideological and political work among the revolutionary factions, having this ideological foundation is not enough; leading comrades must personally grasp it and do so patiently. We must go among the masses as ordinary soldiers, humbly learn from the masses, and be both strict and sincere with the revolutionary factions. When some people are unwilling to sit down and study, we sit down with them, leading them to study Chairman Mao's works, personally reading documents to them, and sharing our insights. When they do not yet realize the harm of erroneous thoughts, we use our own experiences, especially the lessons from our mistakes, to enlighten them and help them correct their mistakes.

Following Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Closely

In this sharp and intense class struggle, the revolutionary situation develops extremely rapidly. Chairman Mao's every new instruction is our action guideline and battle order. Reviewing the path we have taken, we have an even deeper understanding that whenever we encounter obstacles and feel most helpless, most laborious, and most difficult, Chairman Mao always issues new instructions in time. As long as we follow and implement them, all difficulties and obstacles can be overcome. Therefore, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions closely can not only ensure that the revolutionary troops advance victoriously along the course charted by Chairman Mao but also effectively prevent and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary troops, raising their political and policy levels.

Following or not following Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a matter of stance and attitude. The key to following Chairman Mao's latest instructions closely lies in the word "closely." For every new instruction from Chairman Mao, we must act immediately, decisively, and without hesitation, implementing it thoroughly and comprehensively. We must execute it resolutely whether we understand it or not, deepening our understanding in the process of execution.

In late June last year, petty-bourgeois thinking temporarily rose in the revolutionary factions of the Hohhot region, and there was a danger of "internal strife." At this time, Chairman Mao issued the wise instruction to "guide the petty-bourgeois thinking in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution." We immediately implemented it, promptly convening a study session on Chairman Mao's works for the leaders of the revolutionary factions of various colleges and universities in the "Three-in-One" system, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to launch an offensive against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, fighting against sectarianism and anarchism, and extinguishing the sparks of "internal strife." In mid to late September, we began to prepare for the representative conference of workers, peasants, students, and staff in the Hohhot region, encountering various obstacles and slow progress in the great alliance of the revolution. At this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on the great alliance, and we immediately conducted in-depth dissemination and study, letting Chairman Mao's voice directly reach the masses, quickly launching a new high tide of the great alliance of the revolution. Within a week, more than 90% of the units achieved revolutionary great alliances by system, industry, and class.

To closely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must transmit them to the masses at the fastest speed, word for word. The broad revolutionary masses have deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. They are on the front line of the struggle and understand and grasp Chairman Mao's latest instructions the fastest and deepest. Once they hear Chairman Mao's voice, they will take action. Once the masses take action, some organizational leaders who want to act from factionalism and take a utilitarian attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions will not be able to do so. Therefore, in propagating, implementing, and ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must rely on the leaders but not be blinded by them, and should focus our work on the broad masses. To enable the broad masses to hear Chairman Mao's voice as quickly as possible, the most effective method is to go all the way down, with the main responsible comrades at all levels personally propagating and ensuring implementation.

To ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented among the masses, we must first ensure they are implemented in the leaders' thinking. To make the revolutionary factions listen to Chairman Mao, we ourselves must first listen to Chairman Mao. To make the revolutionary factions act according to the Party's policies, we ourselves must first act according to the Party's policies. In August last year, due to the instigation of the class enemy, the extreme "leftist" trend began to emerge in the Inner Mongolia region. Some within the revolutionary troops had a vague understanding of the then-good situation, saying things like "capitalism is being restored, and a great chaos is brewing," and "the Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group is executing a new reactionary line," and so on. Many revolutionary mass organizations were greatly indignant at the organizations and individuals representing this trend. At that time, if the leadership had slightly deviated from Mao Zedong Thought and replaced policy with emotion and factionalism, chaos would have ensued. Based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," we believed that the organizations and masses influenced by the extreme "leftist" trend were internal contradictions within the revolutionary factions, generally issues of ideological understanding. We should conduct serious criticism and help them, but we should not discriminate against them politically or suppress them organizationally. Therefore, for the organizations influenced by the extreme "leftist" trend, although their organizations were small and their numbers few, we always insisted on using democratic methods, discussion methods, and methods of presenting facts and reasoning to basically unify the understanding of the good situation, clarify right and wrong, educate and unite comrades, eliminate the interference of the extreme "leftist" trend, and adhere to the direction of the struggle. From this, we received a profound education: only by firmly acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can we support the left without supporting factions and set a good example for the revolutionary factions to correctly handle internal contradictions among the people.

Cultivating the Revolutionary Factions' Spirit of Self-Criticism

Chairman Mao teaches us: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls and solves the problem of people's worldview.

The entire process of ideological construction of the revolutionary factions is permeated with the struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the struggle between proletarian worldview and bourgeois worldview, that is, the struggle between "public" and "private." Therefore, we must firmly grasp the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism.

Criticizing revisionism must involve fighting selfishness. Only by thoroughly fighting selfishness can revisionism be rooted out. Here, we must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions. The main method to correct various erroneous thoughts within the revolutionary factions is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to inspire and guide them to consciously carry out self-criticism and educate themselves. We must make revolutionary comrades establish the concept that the more self-criticism there is, the more Mao Zedong Thought there is; those who do not engage in self-criticism are not thorough revolutionaries. We must cultivate the habit of serious self-criticism in the revolutionary factions from the beginning of their growth, as Chairman Mao teaches: "They must be modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impetuosity; they must have the spirit of self-criticism and dare to correct their mistakes in work."

To inspire revolutionary comrades to engage in self-criticism, to spark a revolution in their souls, leaders must do a lot of painstaking and detailed ideological work. Especially for the two opposing factions, how to make them both talk less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, and first criticize themselves, requires a lot of hard work.

According to our experience, we must first grasp the active thoughts of those who fear self-criticism and organize them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a targeted manner. From the many study sessions and classes we have organized, the general state of mind is to reveal one's shortcomings and fear ugliness, fight selfishness and fear pain. At the beginning, some people were afraid of being "overthrown" by others and could not take criticism. After the lid was opened, although many people engaged in self-criticism, they could not deeply touch their souls, and some even took the opportunity to show off or indirectly attack comrades with different opinions. After self-criticism was launched, some people were afraid of losing out and always wanted to "exchange equally" with the other side, and so on. We grasped these active thoughts, helped the revolutionary factions select relevant works of Chairman Mao and study the latest instructions, and applied them actively, seeing immediate results. They learned a little, applied a little, and firmly acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

When inspiring revolutionary comrades to fight selfishness, we must emphasize class education. In the revolutionary factions, the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants make up the majority. Their predecessors all have a history of blood and tears. Class education and comparison can best arouse their boundless love for Chairman Mao. Many comrades of worker and peasant origin cried bitterly when recalling bitterness and sweetness. Through comparison, they further realized that if the "self" is not overthrown, the country will be difficult to protect, greatly enhancing their awareness of fighting selfishness.

When carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we must guide the revolutionary comrades to focus on major issues and not dwell on minor issues. Focusing on major issues means focusing on the attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the attitude towards Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the attitude towards grasping the direction of the struggle.

After self-criticism was launched, the leadership encouraged them and did not make them feel downcast. When we found that some comrades' self-criticism was quite profound, we immediately grasped the typical examples and praised them. Some people, when making inspections, spoke of themselves as worthless, and we helped them affirm their achievements and the main trend, encouraging them to move forward. For the inevitable shortcomings and mistakes they made due to lack of struggle experience, we did not nitpick and blame them, but took the initiative to assume responsibility and protect their revolutionary spirit.

In summary, when the leadership mobilizes and organizes the revolutionary factions to educate themselves, we must pay attention to grasping the timing, leading the way, deepening step by step, inspiring everyone to find problems from the struggle between the two lines, find the cause from the depths of the soul, find lessons from shortcomings and mistakes, and find answers from Chairman Mao's works, achieving the goal of transforming thoughts, raising awareness, and enhancing fighting spirit.

Fully Utilizing the Role of the Workers and Peasants as the Main Force

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will win."

To give full play to the role of the workers and peasants as the main force, we must first fully give play to their leading role in firmly grasping the direction of the struggle and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In Hohhot and Baotou, two regions with a higher concentration of workers, we paid more attention to this. For example, in the issue of the great alliance of the revolution, we focused on the workers' revolutionary organizations and handed over the spirit of the Central Committee to them for discussion. At that time, some leaders were confused by factionalism, cherished their positions, and immediately received criticism from the broad masses of workers. Workers said: "For us, there is nothing to fight for, no fame to seek, and no need to build any positions. We are most concerned about uniting to fight against the capitalist roaders, to seize the revolution and promote production, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whoever fights for fame and position, does not unite, we will kick them out." Some leaders were still haggling over "prices" in their rooms, while the workers had already spontaneously united, beating drums and gongs to report their joy. This fully demonstrated that the working class listens to Chairman Mao the most and is the most revolutionary and selfless.

We must pay great attention to the educational and influential role of the workers and peasants in the ideological transformation of the educated youth. The proletarian revolutionary factions in the colleges and universities of the Inner Mongolia region are a very strong revolutionary force, and their overall direction is correct. However, after the victory of seizing power, various non-proletarian thoughts began to emerge. In response to this situation, when we organized the Red Guards to study Chairman Mao's works, we consciously invited representatives of workers and peasants to participate, bringing the strong class feelings of the workers and peasants, who are loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, to the Red Guards. The Red Guards expressed: "Comparing with workers and peasants, we can clearly see two worldviews, two class feelings, and two political responsibilities. If intellectuals do not learn from workers and peasants and do not unite with them, they will achieve nothing."

Following the Path of the People's Liberation Army's Political Construction

In 1964, Chairman Mao issued the great call for "the whole country to learn from the People's Liberation Army," which is an extremely great strategic measure to promote the thought revolutionization of the people of the whole country. However, due to the obstruction of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, Chairman Mao's great call has not been seriously and concretely implemented. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to the side of the broad revolutionary masses, pushing the activity of "the whole country learning from the People's Liberation Army" to a new stage.

The People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is an extremely proletarianized and extremely combat-ready people's army without equal in the world. They are absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, they hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, they study and apply Chairman Mao's works the best, and they have accumulated a set of experiences in emphasizing proletarian politics over the past few decades. Especially after Comrade Lin Biao issued a series of calls to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, proposing a series of major principles such as the Four Firsts, the Three-Eight Style, and emphasizing politics, the revolutionary construction of the People's Liberation Army has made great progress. Therefore, we are determined that to strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions and achieve thought revolutionization, we must follow the path of the People's Liberation Army's political construction. Over the past half year, we have consciously, organized, and planned through military support activities to let the revolutionary factions have more opportunities to fight side by side, work together, and study together with the People's Liberation Army, learning from the People's Liberation Army face to face, causing their spiritual outlook to undergo profound changes.

Through military support activities, the revolutionary factions have learned the deep class feelings and model actions of the People's Liberation Army in being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The People's Liberation Army has always placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, earlier than everything, greater than everything, and more important than everything, insisting on daily reading and daily use. These have begun to be learned by the revolutionary factions. The People's Liberation Army often holds lectures on the application of Chairman Mao's works, sending "guiding lights"—Chairman Mao's quotations—to comrades with shortcomings and mistakes, and these practices have become popular in the revolutionary factions. They said excitedly: "The People's Liberation Army is our best example, most patient teacher, and closest comrade-in-arms."

Through military support activities, the revolutionary factions have begun to learn the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army's emphasis on politics, especially the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts, and grasping active thoughts. Like the People's Liberation Army, they place political and ideological work in the first position in all work, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various real-life ideological problems. In a school where a military support team was responsible for military training, to help eliminate factionalism in the mass organizations, they used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, insisting on persuasion and education, using the People's Liberation Army's method of class education, conducting "two remembrances and three examinations": remembering the bitterness of the old society and the history of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; examining the attitude towards Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, examining whether one's words and deeds conform to the overall direction, and examining the determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Through patient guidance, they finally overcame factionalism and quickly turned their energy to revolutionary education. In the process of establishing the revolutionary committee of the unit, both sides engaged in self-criticism and competed to select each other into the revolutionary committee. Afterwards, they deeply felt: "The People's Liberation Army's method of grasping active thoughts and class education is indeed good."

Practice has proven that the revolutionary factions, by taking the People's Liberation Army as an example everywhere, can more consciously use the "public" to overcome the "private," use proletarian party spirit to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and use the high organizational discipline of "all actions obey orders" to resist various sectarianism and anarchist trends, effectively strengthening the ideological construction, organizational construction, and style construction of the proletarian revolutionary factions, making them advance in large strides on the path of being extremely proletarianized and extremely combat-ready.

"To sail the seas, one needs a helmsman; to make a revolution, one needs Mao Zedong Thought." This is a great truth, the highest truth, and an eternal truth. Over the past half year, our practice of grasping the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions has deeply educated us: the fundamental of grasping ideological education is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, combining study and use, seeing immediate results. For leaders at all levels, no matter how busy, not busy with studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is busy in vain; no matter how much is grasped, not grasping the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions is grasping in vain. The revolution in China and the world is great, and the road ahead is still long, the tasks are arduous, and the struggles are complex. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, with the highest awareness, greatest effort, and most effective measures, continue to grasp and grasp firmly the ideological construction of the revolutionary factions, further command the revolutionary factions with the great Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, break through reefs and waves, advance bravely, and keep the proletarian state forever red!

    按照毛泽东思想建设无产阶级革命大军
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会主任　滕海清
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
      去年六月，内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组成立以后，立即在全区掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓革命的大批判，坚定不移地把斗争矛头指向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，牢牢掌握着这个运动的大方向。但是，由于斗争取得决定性的胜利和革命派地位的变化，在人民内部，各种矛盾开始暴露出来了。例如，革命派和领导干部之间的关系，革命派之间的关系，革命派和受蒙蔽群众之间的关系，革命派和犯错误干部之间的关系，等等，都存在着问题。根据毛主席关于要抓主要矛盾的教导，我们认为要正确处理这些矛盾，就必须狠抓革命派队伍的思想建设，用毛泽东思想统帅这支革命大军。
    在我们刚刚取得胜利的时候，就提出了“学习中国人民解放军突出政治的光荣传统，加强无产阶级革命派队伍思想建设”的战斗口号。接着，迅速组织了一系列的毛主席著作学习会，有针对性地解决斗争中出现的各种矛盾。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号令以后，军队干部、革命派和革命领导干部相结合，工、农、兵相结合，革命派和犯错误的干部、受蒙蔽群众相结合等多种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，自上而下，从城镇到广大的农村、牧区普遍地开办起来。
    几个月来，由于我们坚持不懈地抓住了加强革命派思想建设这个环节，在呼和浩特地区及其它地区没有形成严重对立的两大派，排除了极“左”思潮的干扰，大大克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，发展和巩固了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，保证了毛主席的伟大战略部署步步落实。
          带好革命队伍
      是党赋予我们的光荣任务
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，用毛泽东思想武装革命派，狠抓革命派的思想建设，是实现毛主席关于培养和造就革命接班人的伟大战略决策的最有效的措施，是关系到这支革命大军在夺权以后举什么旗，走什么路，用什么思想掌好权的万年大计。
    根据我们的体会，要坚定不移地抓好革命队伍的思想建设，必须牢固地树立两个“坚信”：坚信毛泽东思想能够统帅一切、改造一切、推动一切；坚信广大革命群众最听毛主席的话，能够自己教育自己。只有这样，才能在千头万绪的工作中大力排除干扰，坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想带好革命派队伍。
    在实际工作过程中，我们曾遇到各种各样的阻力。在夺权胜利之初，有些单位的革命派不能正确对待受蒙蔽的群众。我们发现后立即严肃地指出，革命派决不能以感情代替政策，不能图一时痛快而丧失政治上的主动，一言一行必须符合毛泽东思想。当时，有人思想不通，说我们“右倾”。我们没有受这些人的干扰。当革命派内部出现“内战”苗头时，我们及时帮助他们开展整风，猛斗私心，克服派性，消除分歧，团结对敌。这时，又有人指责我们是“枪口对内不对外”，
  “转移斗争大方向”，等等。我们也没有受他们干扰。在这种情况下，领导者万万不可因为有人反对而产生畏缩情绪和惧怕心理。怕什么呢？无非是怕得罪革命派，怕丢掉自己的威信，怕抓辫子，怕别人造反。千怕万怕，归结成一句话，就是头脑里“私”字作怪。在这些阻力面前，我们的办法就是一条：坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，破私立公。我们深刻体会到，不断克服各种阻力的过程，就是领导者本身破私立公的过程。敢于宣传、贯彻、捍卫毛主席革命路线是最大的公，相反的就是最大的私。这种公和私的斗争，实质上是两条路线斗争在我们头脑里的反映，在狠斗自己“私”字的时候，要自觉地上纲上线。无私才能真爱，真爱才能无畏。爱，就是满怀阶级感情地关怀革命新一代在政治上的成长。无畏就是敢于挺身而出，宣传、贯彻和捍卫毛主席的指示和党的政策，敢于引导和支持群众克服和抵制各种错误言行。
    要做好革命派的思想政治工作，单单有这个思想基础还不行，领导同志一定要亲自抓，而且要耐心地抓。我们自己一定要以普通一兵的身份到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，对革命派既要严格要求，又要诚恳耐心。当有些人无心坐下来学习的时候，我们就带头坐下来，带着他们学习毛主席著作，亲自给他们读文件，谈心得。当他们一时还认识不到错误思想的危害时，我们就用自己的切身经历，特别是犯错误的教训启发他们，帮助他们认识和改正自己的错误。
      紧跟毛主席的最新指示
    在这场尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争中，革命形势发展异常迅猛，毛主席的每一项最新指示，都是我们的行动纲领和战斗号令。回顾我们走过来的这一段路程，更加深刻地体会到，每当我们遇到阻力，感到最棘手、最吃力、最难办的时候，毛主席总是及时地发出新的指示，只要我们紧跟、照办，一切困难和阻力都可以迎刃而解。所以，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，不仅可以保证革命队伍沿着毛主席指引的航道胜利前进，又可以有效地防止和克服革命队伍中资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，提高他们的政治思想水平和政策水平。
    紧跟不紧跟毛主席的最新指示，是个立场问题、态度问题。紧跟毛主席最新指示的关键，在于一个
  “紧”字。对毛主席的每一项最新指示，一定要闻风而动，雷厉风行，不折不扣，坚决照办，条条落实，全面落实。理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。
    去年六月下旬，呼和浩特地区的革命派内部，小资产阶级思想一度抬头，“内战”有一触即发之势。这时，毛主席发出了“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的英明指示，我们立即照办，迅速召开“呼三司”各大专院校革命派负责人的毛主席著作学习会，以毛主席最新指示为武器，向资产阶级、小资产阶级派性展开了一场攻坚战，狠斗了山头主义、无政府主义，扑灭了“内战”的火苗。九月中下旬，我们着手筹建呼和浩特地区的工、农、学、职等代表会，又遇到种种阻力，革命大联合进展较慢。这时，毛主席发出了关于大联合的最新指示，我们立即深入地进行传达、学习，让毛主席的声音直接和群众见面，很快掀起了革命大联合的新高潮，一周之内百分之九十以上的单位就实现了按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合。
    紧跟毛主席的最新指示，必须以最快的速度把最新指示字字句句传达到群众中去。广大革命群众，对伟大领袖毛主席具有深厚的阶级感情。他们处在斗争第一线，对毛主席的最新指示领会得最快、最深，听到毛主席的声音就会行动起来。群众一起来，一些组织的头头要想从派性出发，对毛主席的指示采取实用主义的态度，也就不可能了。所以在宣传、贯彻、落实毛主席的最新指示时，既要依靠头头，又不能迷信头头，应该把工作重点放在广大群众身上。为了使广大群众能够最快地听到毛主席的声音，最有效的办法，就是一竿子插到底，由各级主要负责同志亲自宣传，狠抓落实。
    要使毛主席的最新指示在群众中落实，必须首先在领导思想上落实。要革命派听毛主席的话，我们自己必须首先听毛主席的话。要革命派按党的政策办事，我们自己首先要按照党的政策办事。去年八月份，由于阶级敌人在背后挑动，内蒙古地区的极“左”思潮开始露头。革命队伍内部有些人对当时的大好形势认识不清，说什么“资本主义正在复辟，孕育着一场大乱”，说什么革命委员会筹备小组是“执行新的反动路线”，等等。许多革命群众组织对代表这种思潮的组织和个人表现了极大的愤慨。当时，如果领导上稍稍偏离毛泽东思想，以感情和派性代替政策，就会出乱子。我们根据毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示，认为受极“左”思潮影响的组织和群众，是革命派内部的矛盾，一般是思想认识问题，对他们的错误思想，要进行严肃批评和帮助，但是在政治上不应歧视他们，在组织上不应压制他们。因此，对于受极“左”思潮影响的组织，尽管他们的组织很小，人数很少，大家始终坚持用民主的方法，讨论的方法，摆事实、讲道理的方法，基本上统一了对大好形势的认识，弄清了是非，团结教育了同志，排除了极“左”思潮的干扰，坚持了斗争的大方向。从这里我们受到了一次深刻的教育，只有坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，才能做到支左不支派，为革命派正确处理人民内部矛盾做出好样子。
    培养革命派富于自我批评的精神
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。
      革命派队伍思想建设的整个过程，贯串着无产阶级党性和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争，贯串着无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，也就是
  “公”和“私”的斗争。所以一定要以“斗私，批修”
  为纲。
    批修必须斗私。只有斗私彻底，批修才能刨根。这里一定要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。纠正革命派内部的各种错误思想，主要的方法是以毛泽东思想为武器，启发诱导他们自觉地进行自我批评，自己教育自己。要使革命派同志树立起这样一个观念：多一分自我批评，就多一分毛泽东思想；谁不肯作自我批评，谁就不是一个彻底的革命派。要使革命派在开始成长的时候，就培养起认真的自我批评的优良作风，象毛主席所教导的那样：“他们必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。”
    启发革命派同志作自我批评，在自己灵魂深处爆发革命，领导上要做许多艰苦细致的思想工作。特别是对立的两派，如何使他们双方少讲对方的缺点错误，首先批评自己，更要下一番苦功夫。
    根据我们的体会，首先要摸准怕作自我批评的活思想，有针对性地组织他们活学活用毛主席著作。从我们主办的许多学习会和学习班来看，一般的思想状况是亮私怕丑，斗私怕疼。开始时有的人唯恐别人“打倒”自己，听不进意见。盖子揭开后，不少人虽作自我批评，却不能狠触灵魂，甚至有的乘机表功，或拐弯抹角地攻击持有不同意见的战友。自我批评开展以后，有些人生怕吃亏，总想和对方“等价交换”，等等。我们抓住这些活思想，帮助革命派选读有关的毛主席著作和学习最新指示，活学活用，立竿见影，学一点，用一点，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。
    在启发革命派同志斗私的时候，要抓阶级教育。在革命派队伍中，工人和贫下中农的子女占大多数。他们的前辈都有一部血泪史。一抓阶级教育、回忆对比，最能激发他们对毛主席无限热爱的感情。不少工农出身的同志忆苦思甜时，痛哭失声。通过回忆对比，他们进一步认识到“私”字不倒，江山难保，大大提高了斗私的自觉性。
    在开展批评和自我批评时，要注意引导革命派同志抓大节，不要揪住小节不放。所谓抓大节，就是要抓对毛主席最新指示的态度，抓对毛主席伟大战略部署的态度，抓对掌握斗争大方向的态度。
    在自我批评展开以后，领导上要鼓励他们，不使他们有灰溜溜的感觉。当我们发现有的同志自我批评比较深刻的时候，立即抓住典型，加以表扬。有些人在作检查时把自己说得一钱不值，就要帮助他们肯定成绩，肯定主流，鼓励他们前进。对于他们由于缺乏斗争经验而产生的不可避免的缺点错误，我们没有挑剔责难，而是主动承担责任，保护他们的革命锐气。
    总之，领导上动员和组织革命派自己教育自己的时候，要注意抓住火候，因势利导，步步深化，启发大家从路线斗争中找问题，从灵魂深处找原因，从缺点错误中找教训，从毛主席著作中找答案，达到改造思想、提高觉悟、增强斗志的目的。
    充分发挥工农主力军的作用
    毛主席教导我们：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”
    发挥工农主力军的作用，首先要充分发挥他们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的带头作用。在呼和浩特和包头两个工人比较集中的地区，我们比较注意了这一点。如在革命大联合的问题上，我们着重抓工人革命组织，把中央的精神交给他们讨论。当时有些头头被派性迷惑，留恋山头，立即受到广大工人群众的批评。工人说：“对于我们说来，没什么可争的，也没什么风头可出，更不需要垒什么山头，我们最关心的是联合起来斗走资派，抓革命、促生产，巩固无产阶级专政。谁要争名、争位，不搞联合，我们就踢开他。”有的单位头头们还关在屋子里讲“价钱”，工人们已经自动联合起来，敲锣打鼓报喜去了。这充分显示了工人阶级最听毛主席的话，最富有革命性和大公无私的精神。
    必须十分重视工农主力军对知识青年思想改造的教育和影响作用。内蒙古地区大中学校的无产阶级革命派，是一支很坚强的革命队伍，他们的大方向是正确的。但是，在夺权胜利以后，种种非无产阶级的思想开始抬头。针对这种情况，我们在组织红卫兵小将
  学习毛主席著作的时候，有意识地请工人、农民的代表
  参加，把工农群众无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的强烈的阶级感情带到红卫兵小将中间。红卫兵纷纷
  表示：“比比工农，看看自己，明显地分出了两种世界
  观，两种阶级感情，两种政治责任感。如果知识分子不
  向工农学习，不同工农结合，就将一事无成。”
      走解放军政治建军的道路
    毛主席在一九六四年就发出了“全国学习解放军”的伟大号召，这是促进全国人民思想革命化的极其伟
  大的战略措施。但是，由于党内最大的一小撮走资派
  的百般阻挠，毛主席的这一伟大号召，一直没有得到认真切实的贯彻。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，毛主席把解放军派到广大革命群众身边，这就把“全国学习解放军”的活动，推向了一个崭新的阶段。
      毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的举世无双的人民军队。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，他们把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，他们活学活用毛主席著作最好，他们还有几十年积累下来的突出无产阶级政治的一整套经验。特别是林彪副主席对活学活用毛主席著作发出了一系列的号召，提出了四个第一、三八作风、突出政治等一系列重大的方针原则以后，人民解放军的革命化建设又有了很大的发展。因此，我们认定要想加强革命派的思想建设，实现思想革命化，一定要走解放军政治建军的道路。半年多来，我们有意识、有组织、有计划地通过拥军的活动，让革命派有更多的机会和解放军肩并肩、心连心地战斗在一起，工作在一起，学习在一起，面对面地学习解放军，使他们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    革命派通过拥军活动，最重要、最根本的是学习了人民解放军无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的深厚的阶级感情和模范行动。解放军始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、先于一切、大于一切、重于一切的地位，坚持天天读、天天用等学习制度，这些已开始被革命派学过来了。解放军经常开讲用会，给有缺点错误的同志抄送“指路明灯”——毛主席语录等做法，也在革命派队伍中蔚然成风。他们亲切而激动地说：“解放军是我们最优秀的榜样，最耐心的教员，最亲密的战友。”
    革命派通过拥军活动，把解放军突出政治的光荣传统，特别是活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一、抓好活思想的经验开始学到手。象解放军那样，在一切工作中把政治思想工作摆在首位，用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种现实思想问题。在一个学校负责军训的支左部队，为了帮助消除群众组织中的派性，他们以毛主席最新指示为武器，坚持说服教育，运用解放军抓阶级教育的办法，进行“两忆三查”：忆旧社会的苦，忆文化大革命的斗争史；查对毛主席伟大战略部署的态度，查自己的言行是否符合大方向，查把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。经过耐心引导，终于使他们克服了派性，迅速把精力转到教育革命方面来了。在筹建本单位革命委员会的过程中，双方都做自我批评，争着把对方选入革命委员会。事后，他们深有体会地说：“解放军抓活思想，抓阶级教育的办法就是好。”
    实践证明，革命派队伍处处以解放军为榜样，就能更加自觉地以“公”字去战胜“私”字，用无产阶级党性去克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，用“一切行动听指挥”的高度组织纪律性，去抵制形形色色的山头主义和无政府主义思潮，有效地加强了无产阶级革命派的思想建设、组织建设和作风建设，使他们在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上大踏步前进。
                      ＊　＊　＊
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。这是伟大的真理，最高的真理，永恒的真理。半年来我们抓革命派队伍思想建设的实践深刻地教育了我们：掌握思想教育，根本的根本，就是活学活用毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影。对于各级领导来说，千忙万忙，不忙于活学活用毛泽东思想就是瞎忙；千抓万抓，不抓革命派队伍思想建设就是瞎抓。中国的革命、世界的革命是伟大的，我们面前的路程还很长，任务很艰巨，斗争很复杂，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定要以最高的自觉、最大的努力、最有效的措施，继续大抓狠抓革命派队伍的思想建设，进一步用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅革命派队伍，一辈子紧跟毛主席干革命，绕礁破浪，奋勇前进，使无产阶级的江山永远保持鲜红的颜色！
