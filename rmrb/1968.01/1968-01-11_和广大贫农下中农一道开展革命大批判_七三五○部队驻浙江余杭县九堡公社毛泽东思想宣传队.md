In mid-February 1967, at a critical juncture in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution when the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party was intensifying, we resolutely responded to the great call to arms issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses." We went to Jiubao Commune in Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, to carry out agricultural support tasks. During this period, we joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and commune members in Jiubao Commune, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a fierce criticism of the crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. Over the past few months, we have held more than a hundred commune-wide criticism meetings on various specialized or comprehensive topics. Production brigades and production teams have held thousands of criticism meetings. Fieldside criticism meetings and family criticism meetings have become even more widespread, sparking a high tide of mass revolutionary criticism.

Conducting Thorough, Detailed, and Arduous Thought Mobilization Work

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The masses are the real heroes." Revolutionary criticism is the masses' criticism. Only by mobilizing the masses can we carry out criticism, and only by relying on the masses can we do a good job of criticism.

We worked together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, jointly studying Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, we organized old poor peasants to speak from their personal experiences, inspiring the broad masses of commune members to join the revolutionary criticism. Through comparative education on the periods before and after liberation, before and after cooperativization, and before and after the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members developed an even deeper love for our great leader Chairman Mao and an even greater hatred for China's Khrushchev. In Chaoyang Brigade, ten old poor peasants formed a remembrance and reflection propaganda team. Wherever criticism meetings were held, they went there, combining their personal histories of hardship with a fierce criticism of the crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents, inspiring the entire brigade's commune members to join the revolutionary criticism.

Educating and winning over the deceived masses is a crucial issue in mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism. We, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the commune, which is mainly composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, focused on the ideological and political work among the deceived masses. We went to the production teams with more deceived masses and did more work with individuals who were more deeply deceived. We used Mao Zedong Thought to educate and help them see clearly, uniting with them against the enemy and directing the spearhead of the struggle straight at China's Khrushchev and his agents. The deceived masses woke up one after another, exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in their own areas.

We, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the commune, went deep into the production teams and extensively mobilized the broad masses of women laborers to join the revolutionary criticism. Through investigations, we found that some women with many children and few laborers faced greater difficulties in life. They had suffered greatly from China's Khrushchev's "three autonomies and one contract." The long-term implementation of the "husband-wife shift" and hemp stripping system by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in this area caused them even more harm. We held women's meetings and discussion sessions, linking the class struggle in the commune and brigade with the actual situation, repeatedly propagating Mao Zedong Thought to them, and exposing and criticizing the crimes of China's Khrushchev. When they learned that China's Khrushchev was the chief culprit behind the "three autonomies and one contract" and the implementation of the "husband-wife shift" hemp stripping system, they all gnashed their teeth in hatred and joined the revolutionary criticism.

Playing the Role of Cadres in the Revolutionary Criticism

The cadres at the commune and brigade levels included some who, in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were deceived by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and temporarily took the wrong side. However, they were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. The vast majority of cadres are good or relatively good. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres," the proletarian revolutionary faction of the commune conducted a specific analysis of the cadre team, and everyone agreed that, through the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, we should arouse the deep hatred of revolutionary cadres towards China's Khrushchev, prompting them to stand up and join the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the revolutionary criticism.

High De Liang, the Party branch secretary of Chaoyang Brigade, studied the "Three Articles" and recalled the miserable life of begging for seven years with his parents before liberation and his growth process under Chairman Mao's leadership after liberation, overcoming his shift-change mindset. He firmly stood on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants, mercilessly exposing the various crimes committed by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in pushing the "three autonomies and one contract." His revolutionary actions powerfully inspired other revolutionary cadres.

Currently, more than 90% of the cadres at the commune level have been liberated; the vast majority of Party branch secretaries, brigade leaders, and militia platoon leaders in the entire commune have taken on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, fully playing their leading roles. Combining the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units, promoting revolution and production

For more than a decade, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside has been extremely fierce. Only by combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside be carried out more deeply and thoroughly.

China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line has the most extensive and deepest influence in the Jiubao area, particularly in promoting "three autonomies and one contract" and "husband-wife shifts," which are disguised forms of individual farming. During the busy season for harvesting hemp, we joined the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiubao Commune in holding fieldside criticism meetings, fiercely criticizing the crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in promoting "three autonomies and one contract" and "husband-wife shifts" to restore capitalism. First, we held an on-site criticism meeting in the 14th production team of Jiubao Brigade, which was most deeply poisoned by the "three autonomies and one contract," denouncing the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in promoting "three autonomies and one contract" and destroying the collective economy. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiubao Commune believed that the on-site criticism meeting in the 14th team was deeply revealing, thoroughly critical, and well-organized. They immediately took action, using the form of fieldside criticism to turn the fields into battlefields for denouncing China's Khrushchev.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also closely focused on production links to carry out various specialized criticisms. During the hemp harvesting season, they criticized the "husband-wife shifts" of the "three autonomies and one contract"; during sowing, they criticized the capitalist "freedom of operation"; during year-end distribution, they criticized the "three lights and four leavings" that undermine socialism (distribute everything, eat everything, use everything; leave no public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, reserve grain, or production cost). At the same time, they criticized and reformed, including individual operations of hemp cloth processing as part of collective production. Through these criticisms, the thought reform of the people was greatly promoted, and the collective economy was greatly consolidated.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Jiubao Commune are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Since Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," Jiubao Commune has set up various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 16,000 commune members and cadres participating in the study. Everyone has joined this great thought revolution with the focus on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." Everyone is concerned about national affairs, grasping revolution, and promoting production. Last year, despite a severe drought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants made history by establishing an electric pump irrigation station on the banks of the Qiantang River for the first time, irrigating the fields, and achieving an overall bumper harvest.

    和广大贫农下中农一道开展革命大批判
    七三五○部队驻浙江余杭县九堡公社毛泽东思想宣传队
    一九六七年二月中旬，在无产阶级文化大革命进入向党内一小撮走资派夺权的关键时刻，我们坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席发出的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大战斗号召，到浙江省余杭县九堡公社执行支农任务。在支农过程中，我们同九堡公社广大贫农下中农、革命干部和社员群众一道，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村复辟资本主义的罪行。几个月来，召开了各种专题或综合性的全公社批判大会一百多次；生产大队和生产队也开了数以千计的批判大会；田头批判会、家庭批判会开得更为普遍，掀起了群众性的革命大批判高潮。
  进行深入、细致、艰苦的思想发动工作
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。革命的大批判，是群众的大批判，只有动员群众才能进行大批判，只有依靠群众才能搞好大批判。
    我们和贫农下中农在一起，共同学习毛主席著作，同时组织老贫农现身说法，带动广大社员群众投入革命的大批判。通过解放前后、合作化前后和文化大革命前后的回忆对比教育，大大激发了贫农下中农和社员群众对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，大大加深了贫农下中农和社员群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨。朝阳大队有十个老贫农，组成一个忆苦思甜宣传组，哪里开批判会，他们就到哪里去，结合自己的苦难家史，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的罪行，带动了全大队的社员群众参加革命大批判。
    教育争取受蒙蔽的群众，是发动群众搞好革命大批判的一个重要问题。我们和公社以贫农下中农为主体的无产阶级革命派一道，抓紧了受蒙蔽群众的思想政治工作。哪个生产队受蒙蔽的群众多，就到哪个生产队去；哪个人受蒙蔽较深，就多做哪个人的工作。我们用毛泽东思想教育和帮助他们擦亮眼睛，共同对敌，把斗争的矛头直指中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人。受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒过来，对本地区党内一小撮走资派进行了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。
    我们和公社无产阶级革命派一道，深入生产队，广泛发动广大劳动妇女投入革命的大批判。经过调查研究，发现有些家庭子女多、劳动力少的妇女，生活比较困难，她们吃尽了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的苦头。本地区党内一小撮走资派长期推行的“夫妻班”剥络麻制度，使她们受害更深。我们通过召开妇女会、座谈会等方式，联系社、队的阶级斗争实际，反复向她们宣传毛泽东思想，揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。当她们知道了中国赫鲁晓夫就是“三自一包”和推行“夫妻班”剥络麻制度的罪魁祸首以后，个个切齿痛恨，参加革命的大批判。
    在大批判中发挥干部的骨干作用
    公社和大队以上的干部，有的人在无产阶级文化大革命初期，由于受本地区党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽，一时站错了队。但是，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。绝大多数的干部都是好的，比较好的。遵照毛主席
  “相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，公社无产阶级革命派对干部队伍作了具体分析，大家认为，应当通过批判资产阶级反动路线，激发革命干部对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，促使他们站出来，同广大贫农下中农一道，投入革命的大批判。
    朝阳大队党支部书记高德良，学习了“老三篇”，回忆了解放前跟父母亲讨了七年饭的悲惨生活和解放后在毛主席领导下的成长过程，克服了换班思想。他坚决站在贫农下中农一边，毫不留情地揭露了本地区党内一小撮走资派推行“三自一包”的种种罪行。他的革命行动有力地带动了其他革命干部。
    目前，公社一级干部百分之九十以上已经解放；全公社绝大多数大队党支部书记、大队长、民兵连长，都挑起了革命和生产两副担子，充分发挥了骨干作用。结合本单位斗批改，抓革命促生产
    十多年来，农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分激烈，只有把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，才能把农村无产阶级文化大革命搞得更深、更透。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，在九堡地区流毒最广、影响最深的是搞“三自一包”、“夫妻班”等变相单干。在抢收络麻的大忙季节，我们就和九堡公社的贫农下中农大搞田头批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“夫妻班”等复辟资本主义的罪行。首先，我们在受“三自一包”毒害最深的九堡大队第十四生产队召开了现场批判会，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行“三自一包”，破坏集体经济的滔天罪行。九堡公社的广大贫农下中农认为，十四队现场批判会揭得深，批得透，开得好。他们立即行动起来，纷纷运用田头大批判的形式，把田头当作讨伐中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。
    广大贫农下中农还紧扣生产环节，进行了各种专题批判。
    收获络麻的季节，就批判
  “三自一包”的“夫妻班”；播种时，就批判资本主义的“经营自由”；年终分配时，就批判挖社会主义墙脚的“三光四不留”（分光、吃光、用光；不留公积金、公益金、贮备粮、生产成本）。同时，还边批边改，把个体经营的土麻布加工的副业列入了集体生产。通过这些大批判，大大促进了人的思想革命化，大大地巩固了集体经济。
    目前，九堡公社广大贫农下中农和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作蔚然成风。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以来，九堡公社开办了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的社员和干部达一万六千多人次。大家都投入了这场以“斗私，批修”为纲的思想大革命。人人关心国家大事，狠抓革命，猛促生产。去年，在大旱情况下，广大贫农下中农破天荒地第一次在钱塘江畔建立了电机灌溉站，引水浇田，夺得了全面丰收。
