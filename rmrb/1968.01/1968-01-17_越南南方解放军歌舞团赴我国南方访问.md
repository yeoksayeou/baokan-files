The Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, led by Nguyen Thuan Hung, departed from Beijing by special train this morning to visit and perform in southern China.

Relevant officials including Zhou Yiping, as well as soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, military art workers, revolutionary masses from the capital, and Red Guards, totaling over 500 people, gathered at the station to send them off warmly.

Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and revolutionary masses from the capital arrived at Beijing Station early in the morning, holding high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and portraits of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They also held large banners reading "Firmly Support the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against American Aggression" and other slogans.

When the members of the Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe walked onto the platform, the people sending them off waved copies of the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans such as "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "The Chinese people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The train, filled with the warm atmosphere of the fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam, slowly pulled out of the station. The Vietnamese cultural warriors stood at the doors and windows of the carriages, waving goodbye to their Chinese comrades.

Nguyen Van Cuong, head of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Ly Thong Thi, acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing also came to the station to see them off.

    新华社十六日讯　由阮春鸿率领的越南南方解放军歌舞团，今天上午乘专车离开北京，前往我国南方进行访问演出。
    周一萍等有关方面负责人，以及中国人民解放军指战员、部队文艺工作者、首都革命群众和红卫兵小将五百多人到车站热烈欢送。
    中国人民解放军指战员和首都革命群众，今天一早就高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的画像和越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席的画像，高举“坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争”等巨幅标语，来到北京车站。
    当越南南方解放军歌舞团的同志们走进月台时，欢送的人们挥动红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“中越两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“中国人民决心同越南人民并肩战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者！”“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    列车在充满中越两国人民战斗团结的热烈气氛中徐徐开出车站，越南南方的文艺战士们站在车厢门口和车窗前，向中国战友们频频招手，依依告别。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始和在北京的越南同志，也到车站送行。（附图片）
