Victory will surely belong to the people of Indochina

A strong east wind is blowing, and good news is coming in frequently. Under the encouragement of the great revolutionary situation worldwide, the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Indochina has shown a new and inspiring situation.

The heroic Vietnamese people are holding high the great banner of resisting America and saving the nation, fighting stronger and stronger in the anti-aggression war. The military and civilians of South Vietnam achieved a glorious victory last year, annihilating nearly 365,000 enemy troops, including more than 170,000 American and puppet troops. At the beginning of this year, the military and civilians of South Vietnam resolutely responded to the battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, persevering in the spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting, advancing in victory, and fiercely striking the enemy. Recently, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam attacked the American air base in Da Nang, destroying 67 American planes in one go; in the demilitarized zone and other battlefields, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam has also launched a series of new and major offensives, achieving a series of new and major victories. The military and civilians of North Vietnam have already shot down more than 2,700 American aggressor planes, dealing a heavy blow to the war blackmail policy of American imperialism. The victory of the Vietnamese people has greatly encouraged the revolutionary people of the whole world, deflated the arrogance of American imperialism, and put the American aggressors in a desperate situation.

Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos have fought tenaciously and achieved brilliant victories. Since this year, they have, on the basis of last year's great victories, extensively launched a people's guerrilla war, taking the initiative to attack the enemy and achieving new victories at the beginning of the year. Recently, they launched a fierce offensive, attacking the right-wing army of Laos, annihilating more than 700 enemy troops, liberating the strategic town of Nam Bao, and initially thwarting the dry-season military adventure plan of American imperialism and its lackeys. The great victory at Nam Bao demonstrated the invincible power of the people's war and once again exposed the paper tiger of American imperialism.

The people of Cambodia are bravely persisting in their just struggle against the aggression of American imperialism. The Royal Government of Cambodia has taken a firm stand to defend national independence and sovereignty in the face of American imperialism's war threats, showing a spirit of fearlessness. On January 18, the Cambodian army bravely repelled the attack of the American-South Vietnamese puppet army at the Peamontaya outpost in the province of Prey Veng. The Royal Government of Cambodia and the people of Cambodia are firmly maintaining their struggle for independence, neutrality, and territorial sovereignty, powerfully smashing the aggressive plots of American imperialism, and winning the respect of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the whole world.

The counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism is to turn the entire Indochina Peninsula into its base of aggression and colony. The peoples of the three countries of Indochina are facing American imperialism, their most ferocious common enemy. They are closely related in fortune and misfortune, and their interests are shared. The just struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Lao people, and the Cambodian people to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and maintain national independence is mutually supportive.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "To maintain national independence and state sovereignty, it is necessary to engage in a head-on struggle against American imperialism, which is aggressive by nature."

The long-term anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Indochina tells us: For the various peoples to strive for and maintain national independence, to deal with the bullying American imperialism, the only way is to fundamentally not fall for its tricks. You bully, we do not endure; you threaten, we are not afraid; you deceive, we do not believe; you invade, we resist firmly. Any country in the world, regardless of size, as long as it has the courage to defy bullying and dare to fight, relying on the broad masses of the people, can frustrate the aggressive plots of American imperialism and achieve victory in the struggle for and maintenance of national independence.

At present, American imperialism, with the support of the Soviet revisionist clique, is hastening to plot the expansion of the war of aggression in Indochina. In order to salvage the failure of the Vietnam War, the Americans not only continue to send more troops to South Vietnam and strengthen the bombing of North Vietnam but also actively plot to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula. The American ruling clique has repeatedly shouted about implementing the so-called "pursuit" policy against Laos and Cambodia. It incites the Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys to repeatedly invade the Cambodian border. American aggressor planes bomb the liberated areas of Laos day and night, even secretly establishing so-called "electronic warning system obstacle zones" in Laos, attempting to "cut off infiltration" in South Vietnam, and trying to reverse their defeat on the South Vietnamese battlefield.

It must be pointed out that the right-wing in Laos, under the instructions of American imperialism, has recently not only launched large-scale attacks on the liberated areas of Laos along the China-Laos and Vietnam-Laos borders but has also openly sent planes to bomb our border. This proves that the right-wing in Laos is completely a loyal lackey of American imperialism, a bunch of traitors who sell out the interests of the Lao nation. They are die-hard followers of American imperialism and will not have a good ending, ultimately only able to die for American imperialism.

In the common struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, the peoples of the countries of Indochina have established a solid fighting friendship. Facing the new plots of American imperialism to expand the war, they will surely unite more closely, fight together, support each other, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Victory will surely belong to the people of Indochina!

    胜利一定属于印度支那人民
    本报评论员
    东风劲吹，捷报频传。在全世界一片大好革命形势的鼓舞下，印度支那人民的反帝斗争出现了令人振奋的新局面。
    英雄的越南人民高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，在反侵略战争中越战越强。南越军民去年取得了歼敌近三十六万五千人，其中包括美军和帮凶军十七万多人的辉煌战果。南越军民今年年初坚决响应胡志明主席和南方民族解放阵线的战斗号召，发扬不怕疲劳、连续作战的精神，乘胜前进，猛烈地打击敌人。最近，南越解放军袭击岘港美国空军基地，一举毁伤美机六十七架；在非军事区附近以及其它战场，南越解放军也连续发动攻势，取得了一系列新的重大胜利。越南北方军民已经打下二千七百多架美国强盗飞机，沉重打击了美帝国主义的战争讹诈政策。越南人民的胜利大大地鼓舞了全世界的革命人民，灭了美帝国主义的威风，使美国侵略者陷于走投无路的困境。
    老挝爱国军民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，艰苦奋战，不断取得光辉的胜利。今年以来，他们在去年巨大胜利的基础上，广泛开展人民游击战争，主动进攻敌人，取得了开门红的新战绩。最近，他们以凌厉的攻势，袭击了老挝右派军队，歼敌七百多名，解放了战略要地南博，初步挫败了美帝国主义及其走狗的旱季军事冒险计划。南博大捷，显示了人民战争的无比威力，再一次戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎。
    柬埔寨人民英勇地坚持反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。柬埔寨王国政府在美帝国主义的战争威胁面前，采取了坚决捍卫民族独立和国家主权的严正立场，表现了不畏强暴的气概。一月十八日，柬埔寨军队在波罗勉省的佩昂蒙特亚哨所，英勇击退了美国—南越伪军的袭击。柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民坚决维护独立、中立和领土主权的斗争，有力地粉碎了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，赢得了中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的敬佩。
    美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，是要把整个印度支那半岛变成为它的侵略基地和殖民地。印度支那三国人民正面对着美帝国主义这个最凶恶的共同敌人。他们是休戚相关、利害与共的。越南人民、老挝人民和柬埔寨人民为反对美帝国主义侵略，维护民族独立而进行的正义斗争，是互相支持的。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“为了维护民族独立和国家主权，必须同侵略成性的美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争。”
    印度支那人民长期的反帝斗争实践告诉我们：各国人民为了争取和维护民族独立，对付横行霸道的美帝国主义，唯一的办法就是根本不吃它的那一套。你欺负，决不忍受；你威胁，毫不害怕；你欺骗，决不相信；你侵略，坚决抵抗。世界上的国家，不分大小，只要有这种不畏强暴、敢于斗争的勇气，依靠广大的人民，就能够挫败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，取得争取和维护民族独立的胜利。
    目前，美帝国主义正在苏修集团的支持下，加紧策划在印度支那扩大侵略战争。为了挽救侵越战争的失败，美帝不仅继续向南越增兵，加强对越南北方的轰炸，而且积极策划把战火扩大到整个印度支那。美国统治集团一再叫嚷要对老挝和柬埔寨实行所谓“穷追”政策。它唆使泰国和南越走狗不断侵犯柬埔寨边境。美国强盗飞机夜以继日地轰炸老挝解放区，甚至在老挝秘密建立所谓“电子警报系统障碍地带”，对越南南方搞什么“切断渗透”，妄图扭转它在南越战场上的败局。
    必须指出，老挝右派在美帝国主义指使下，最近不仅在中老、越老边境对老挝解放区发动大规模进攻，而且公然派遣飞机轰炸我国边境。这证明了老挝右派完全是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，是一伙出卖老挝民族利益的卖国贼。他们死心塌地追随美帝国主义，是不会有什么好下场的，到头来只能给美帝国主义殉葬。
    印度支那各国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中，已建立起了巩固的战斗友谊。面对着美帝国主义扩大战争的新阴谋，他们必将更加紧密地团结起来，共同战斗，互相支持，彻底打败美国侵略强盗。
    胜利一定属于印度支那人民！
