Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Be a Servant of the People

Five Good Worker Zhang Sanhuai

Chairman Mao teaches us to "completely, selflessly serve the people." This is the proletarian worldview that every Communist Party member should uphold. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev dares to say, "Suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage, this is in line with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview." Nonsense! "Suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage" is the pure calculation of a speculator, the business strategy of a capitalist. It is completely incompatible with the proletarian worldview. The Chinese Khrushchev dares to pass off the goods of landlords and capitalists as the proletarian worldview, which is utterly malicious.

In 1958, the organization assigned me to the pig farm as the squad leader. On this new battlefield, I and my comrades studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, often taking Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool as examples, using "completely, thoroughly serving the people" as the standard, measuring everything and comparing at all times. With the red sun in our hearts, we fear neither hard work nor dirt in our work, and have been rated as a four-good squad for five consecutive years.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "always starting from the interests of the people," last year I heard that a certain place in Shandong had suffered a natural disaster. I felt that I should support them spiritually and materially, so I sent them "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a portrait of Chairman Mao, and some cash. Some comrades asked me, "Squad leader, you are from Hebei, why send money to Shandong?" I said, "Whether it's Shandong or Hebei, the proletariat of the world is one family. The commune is public, and it is indeed public!" A Communist Party member should follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "caring for the party and the masses more than caring for oneself, caring for others more than caring for oneself," thinking what the masses think, urgently addressing the needs of class brothers, resolutely and wholeheartedly doing things for the public, and not doing anything for personal gain. Some comrades asked me, "Your squad members have already become cadres, why are you still feeding pigs?" I said, "Comrade Zhang Zedong was an old Red Army soldier, he could burn charcoal for the revolution, and I can raise pigs for the revolution. We are all servants of the people."

The Chinese Khrushchev wants to dress up "suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage" as the proletarian worldview and force it upon us Communist Party members. His purpose is to corrupt Party members with the decadent and declining bourgeois worldview, attempting to change the nature of Party members and make them tools for his usurpation of the Party and restoration of capitalism. Let me tell you, this is a futile dream, a daytime fantasy, and it will never happen! We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the revolutionary broom to sweep the Chinese Khrushchev and his poisonous "suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage" into the garbage heap of history. We must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, thoroughly reform our worldview, and firmly establish the proletarian worldview, becoming good Party members who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao.

    听毛主席的话，做人民的勤务员
    五好职工　张三怀
    毛主席教导我们要“毫不利己专门利人”，“全心全意地为人民服务”。这是我们共产党员应有的无产阶级世界观。而中国赫鲁晓夫竟胡说什么“吃点小亏，占大便宜，这是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的。”呸！“吃小亏占大便宜”是地地道道的投机商人的如意算盘，是资本家的生意经。它和无产阶级的世界观水火不相容。中国赫鲁晓夫竟把地主、资产阶级的货色硬充无产阶级世界观，真是恶毒至极。
    一九五八年组织上调我到猪场当班长。在新的战斗岗位上，我和同志们活学活用毛主席著作，经常以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，以“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务为尺子，事事量，时时比。我们心中有了红太阳，在工作中不怕累，不怕脏，连续五年被评为四好班。
    按照毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发”的教导，去年我听说山东某地发生自然灾害，我感到应当从精神上和物质上支援他们一下，就寄去了《毛泽东选集》、毛主席像，以及一部分现款。有同志问我：“班长，你是河北人，给山东寄钱干啥？”我说：“管他是山东，是河北，天下无产阶级是一家，公社公社，就是公嘛！”共产党员就是要按照毛主席“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导，想群众所想，急阶级兄弟所急，为公的事，坚决地干，拚命地干；为私的事，说什么也不干。有的同志问我：“你们班的战士有的已经当了干部，你为什么还喂猪呢？”我说：“张思德同志是老红军，他能为革命烧炭，我也能为革命养猪，我们都是人民的勤务员。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫硬要把“吃小亏占大便宜”打扮成无产阶级世界观，强加给我们共产党员，他的目的就是要用腐朽没落的资产阶级世界观腐蚀党员，妄图使党员变质，成为他篡党和复辟资本主义的工具。告诉你，这完全是痴心妄想，白日作梦，永远办不到！我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用革命的铁扫把，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他的那套“吃小亏占大便宜”的毒药统统扫进历史的垃圾堆。我们一定要执行毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，彻底地改造世界观，牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，做一个永远忠于毛主席的好党员。
