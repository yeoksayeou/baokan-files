The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries across the country are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying party organizations, determined to build the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party to be more vibrant, pure, and strong.

New China News Agency, January 18th - "Party organizations should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies as a vibrant vanguard organization." Chairman Mao's great instruction, issued at the beginning of the new year as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is marching towards comprehensive victory, has greatly inspired and educated the proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of Communist Party members who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought across the country. It has brought them new, sharp ideological weapons and new fighting strength.

They excitedly said: Chairman Mao's latest instruction is a new development of Marxism-Leninism on party building, a great program for our party rectification. We must study it repeatedly, understand it deeply, implement it swiftly, and resolutely carry it out. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly criticize the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian party line, and complete the glorious task of rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building. This will make our great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party even purer and stronger, further becoming a vibrant vanguard organization composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies.

After Chairman Mao's great program for party rectification was published in the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and the broad masses of party members across the country immediately began serious study and discussion, launching a mass movement to study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's party line. On January 2nd, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a meeting, calling on all revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses on various fronts in the city to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, deeply carry out a comprehensive study of Chairman Mao's proletarian party line, and a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line, to lay the ideological foundation for this party rectification. While rectifying the party organization, the Communist Youth League, the Red Guards, and various revolutionary mass organizations should also be rectified in terms of ideology and organization, to welcome the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the meeting, representatives from Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7, the Shanghai Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and Shanghai No. 1 Department Store introduced their experiences in deeply carrying out mass study and criticism in the rectification of the party. They expressed their determination to seriously study and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to achieve new results in rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building, and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Many revolutionary masses and Communist Party members in factories, schools, and government agencies in Beijing studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and further realized the great significance of rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of Communist Party members and revolutionary workers at the Beijing Transportation Company's Repair Factory, who had previously studied Chairman Mao's works on party building, also studied the history of the two-line struggle within the party. They further recognized the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and the harm of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line. Under the inspiration and guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on this party rectification, all revolutionary workers and party members in the factory decided to better study and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and to do a good job in rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building in the new year.

The revolutionary masses and the broad masses of party members in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee enthusiastically hailed the publication of Chairman Mao's great program for party rectification, unanimously agreeing that this is a great event for the entire party and the people of the whole country. They said: The current era has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. In China, according to Mao Zedong Thought, to rectify the party organization and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, this concerns the future and destiny of China, and the future and destiny of the proletarian revolution. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party building has pointed the direction for our party to further build itself into a strong revolutionary fortress. The responsible person of the Revolutionary Headquarters of the Revolutionary Workers of Shandong said that rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building is a matter of great importance for thousands of years and tens of thousands of years, a top priority that concerns the future of the Chinese revolution, and also an important combat task for us in the new year. We must carry out a comprehensive study of Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line, to build our highest form of proletarian class organization—the Chinese Communist Party—into a more vibrant vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies.

During the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of Communist Party members expressed their determination to take the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party rectification as powerful weapons, to further launch a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line, to thoroughly eliminate its poison, and to make Chairman Mao's proletarian party line forever guide the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party to victory. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are currently launching a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line. The revolutionary workers said that currently, politically, ideologically, theoretically, and organizationally, thoroughly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line and establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian party line, rectifying the party organization, and strengthening party building are important signs of the deep development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and also a great mission entrusted by history to us. On the afternoon of January 3rd, Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province held a report meeting on Chairman Mao's party line with more than 6,000 revolutionary masses and military personnel participating. The representatives who spoke at the meeting said that studying Chairman Mao's proletarian party line, thoroughly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line, rectifying the party organization, and strengthening party building are great tasks to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we must resolutely complete them.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guiyang repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and implemented them swiftly. In recent days, they held many large and small meetings, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to thoroughly expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line. They said that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of top officials within the party who are taking the capitalist road are attempting to restore capitalism in China. Their evil conspiracy first attacks the Chinese Communist Party, personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and promoting the revisionist party line, attempting to turn our Marxist-Leninist party into a revisionist party, and change the whole of China. We will not allow it! We will resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and annihilate the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line. The students of the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the Guangdong Revolutionary Preparatory Committee criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary "tame tool theory" and his revisionist party program, "Self-Cultivation." They said that the Chinese Khrushchev advocates the reactionary "tame tool theory" and the betrayal of proletarian dictatorship "closed-door cultivation," with the purpose of attempting to make the broad masses of party members and cadres become tools for his restoration of capitalism. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strive to be proletarian revolutionary fighters who always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and always fight alongside the revolutionary masses against the class enemies. We must always listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly support what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly oppose what is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party rectification were issued, the broad masses of party members loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses across the country immediately sprang into action. Many places studied and implemented specific plans and outlines for party rectification work; some units that started party rectification work earlier also exchanged experiences and insights, determined to follow Chairman Mao's great program for party rectification, to build our great, glorious, and correct party to be purer, more vibrant, and stronger, and under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, to better complete the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. After seriously studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Revolutionary Preparatory Committee of Henan Province immediately formulated a plan for party rectification work and determined trial units for party rectification work in some cities, prefectures, and counties to gain experience. The Revolutionary Committee of Binjiang District in Harbin made three arrangements for party rectification work: first, organize party members and the masses to deeply study Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party rectification; second, immediately launch a high tide of criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party line throughout the district; third, focus on the ideological and political work of party members, seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and help party members correctly treat themselves and correctly treat the masses.

The New China Printing Factory in Hunan Province is deeply mobilizing the masses to formulate a comprehensive plan for party rectification. The broad revolutionary workers of this factory said that we must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to do a good job in party rectification work. We must absorb a group of outstanding proletarian advanced elements who have emerged during the Cultural Revolution into the party, and expel traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders from the party. For the few party members who have made serious mistakes, we mainly use the method of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes to strengthen their education and help them raise their consciousness. Wuhan Huazhong Institute of Technology has already held two sessions of Mao Zedong Thought party rectification study classes, with more than 500 people participating in the study. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they summarized the experiences of the first two sessions and are actively preparing for the third session of the study class. Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Fisheries Bureau system used the form of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to carry out the work of rectifying the party organization. Many party members who participated in the study classes deeply felt that this Cultural Revolution is the most severe test, the most comprehensive examination, and the deepest education for every party member. We must use the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly transform our worldview and forever be servants of the people. They not only humbly accepted the criticism and help of the masses in the study classes, but some party members also actively sought opinions from the masses in their spare time. Revolutionary masses satisfactorily said that rectifying the party organization according to the proletarian party line of our great leader Chairman Mao, our great, glorious, and correct party will definitely become purer, more vibrant, and stronger, and will definitely better lead the people of the whole country to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋，首先向我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的中国共产党进攻，反对毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，推行修正主义建党路线，妄想把我们马列主义的党变成修正主义的党，使整个中国改变颜色。我们绝不答应！我们坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭。广东省革筹小组举办的毛泽东思想学习班的学员们，在学习和讨论毛主席的最新指示的时候，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫反动的“驯服工具论”和他的修正主义建党纲领黑《修养》。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹反动的“驯服工具论”和背叛无产阶级专政的“闭门修养”，其目的就是妄图使广大党员、干部充当他复辟资本主义的工具。我们要坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，努力做一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远和革命群众在一起向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的无产阶级革命战士。我们要永远听毛主席的话，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决拥护；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决反对。
