	Mountains may be high, but they cannot surpass the people's enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works; the sea may be vast, but it cannot match the people's resolve in studying Chairman Mao's works. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is unyielding in the face of wind and rain.

	Once the people understand the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought and taste the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works, they will generate boundless enthusiasm and infinite strength. They can overcome any difficulty and place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position that is higher than everything, earlier than everything, more important than everything, and greater than everything.

	Fifteen women from the Left Gate neighborhood, including Zhao Jinfen and Wang Xiuzhen, some in their fifties or sixties, some with poor health, and some with several children, overcame all obstacles and difficulties. They traveled several miles each day to participate in study sessions, making multiple round trips daily, and attended the study class for over ten days without ever being late or leaving early.

	One day, it rained heavily, the wind blew fiercely, and the weather was very cold. According to the schedule, the study session was to begin at eight o'clock. The soldier guiding the study said: "Today's study session will probably be affected. How can the students from Left Gate arrive on time?" Some even said: "If they arrive by nine o'clock, that would be good enough."

	However, to everyone's surprise, at seven fifty, the students from Left Gate braved the wind and rain, enduring the cold, and arrived at the study session.

	The soldiers were both happy and admiring, asking with concern: "It's raining outside, how did you manage to arrive so early?"

	Zhao Jinfen and Wang Xiuzhen replied in unison: "We can skip meals, go without water, and not sleep, but we cannot relax our study of Mao Zedong Thought for even a moment! We are steadfast and unyielding in the face of wind and rain."

	Their deep love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought moved the soldiers guiding the study. They forgot about eating and joined everyone in reciting Chairman Mao's latest directives:

	"The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before."

	"The important sign of an excellent situation is that the people have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been mobilized so extensively and deeply. ..."

    山高，没有人民群众学习毛主席著作的热情高；海大，没有人民群众学习毛主席著作的决心大。
    学习毛泽东思想风雨无阻
    人民群众一旦懂得了学习毛泽东思想的伟大意义，尝到学习毛主席著作的甜头，就会产生极大的热情，无限的力量，任何困难也可以克服，就可以把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，先于一切，重于一切，大于一切的位置。
    居住在左安门的街道妇女赵金凤、王秀珍等十五人，有的是五、六十岁的老太太，有的身体不好，有的是好几个孩子的妈妈，但是，她们摆脱了一切拖累，克服了重重困难，每天到几里以外的地方参加学习，一天往返几次，参加学习班十几天，从未迟到早退。
    有一天，下起了雨，风也刮得厉害，天气很冷。按照规定，八点开始学习。辅导学习的解放军同志说：今天学习恐怕要受影响了，住在左安门的学员八点钟怎么能赶得到呢？也有的说：九点钟来到就不错了。
    可是，事出人料，在七点五十分，居住在左安门的学员冒着风雨，顶着严寒，赶到了学习班。
    解放军同志又是高兴，又是钦佩，很关心地问：天下着雨，怎么还能来得这么早？
    赵金凤、王秀珍她们齐声回答：“饭可以不吃，水可以不喝，觉可以不睡，学习毛泽东思想一刻也不能放松！雷打不动，风雨无阻。”
    她们这种无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想的感情，深深地感动了辅导学习的解放军同志，他们忘记了吃饭，便和大家一起朗读毛主席的最新指示：
      “全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”
    “形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。……”
