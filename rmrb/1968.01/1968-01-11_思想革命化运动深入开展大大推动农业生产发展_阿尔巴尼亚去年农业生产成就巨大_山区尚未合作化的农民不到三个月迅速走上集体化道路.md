Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, the broad masses of agricultural workers in Albania made tremendous achievements in their struggle for an agricultural harvest and, in particular, for self-sufficiency in grain in 1967.

At the beginning of last year, peasants in the mountainous regions of Albania who had not yet been collectivized responded enthusiastically to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour. In less than three months, they quickly embarked on the socialist collectivization path and established more than 500 agricultural production cooperatives. The members of the broad agricultural production cooperatives responded to the initiative of the Stalin Cooperative in Lushnje District and the Enver Hoxha Cooperative in Fier District by voluntarily reducing the private plots and livestock of the cooperative members. The workers of the state farms responded to the initiative of the Dimitrov State Farm in Tirana by voluntarily abolishing private plots and livestock. The cadres of the agricultural cooperatives and state farms participated even more actively in collective production labor.

The broad masses of agricultural workers responded to Comrade Hoxha's speech on February 6 last year by actively launching a mass movement against bureaucracy, religious superstition, and backward customs. The deepening of the ideological revolution greatly promoted the development of agricultural production.

The agricultural total output value for last year is expected to exceed the planned 12% increase over the previous year, with the grain production plan already completed in excess. The unit area yield of wheat reached the highest level in Albanian history. The famous corn-producing area of Dibra, the agricultural workers last year completed the grain production plan by 13% in excess, producing 26,600 tons more grain than originally planned. Some mountainous areas that were previously unable to ensure self-sufficiency in grain achieved self-sufficiency in grain for the first time last year.

Last year, the national reclamation plan was completed by 118%. In addition, agricultural workers achieved remarkable results in water conservancy irrigation, land leveling, and soil improvement. Compared with the previous year, the amount of chemical fertilizer applied to farmland increased fivefold, and organic fertilizer increased by 20%.

Since last year, the broad masses of agricultural workers have responded to the call of the Party of Labour and conducted 2,600 scientific experiments, especially experiments on increasing grain production. Due to the results of the scientific experiments, the area of high-yield fields nationwide increased threefold compared to the previous year. The 7,500 hectares of corn planted in Dibra District had an average yield of 24 tons per hectare. A farm in Korça District harvested 42 tons of wheat per hectare on 600 hectares of land. Fifteen cooperatives in Durrës District planted 650 hectares of rice, achieving a large-scale harvest with an average yield of 52 tons per unit area.

On the basis of a double harvest in ideology and production, the members of the broad agricultural cooperatives enthusiastically handed over public grain to the state and sold surplus agricultural and livestock products. By the end of November last year, many districts such as Shkodër, Fier, Gjirokastër, and Sarandë had completed their grain delivery tasks.

The area of autumn sowing last year was also expanded by 33,000 hectares compared to the previous year, exceeding the sowing plan.

Now, many agricultural workers are using the winter idle time to actively continue studying the documents of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour and Comrade Hoxha's speeches, further promoting the ideological revolution. At the same time, the members of the broad agricultural cooperatives and workers of the state farms across the country are working hard to reclaim land, deep plow, build water conservancy projects, and accumulate fertilizer despite the winter cold, striving to achieve an even greater harvest this year.

With the development of industrial construction, the mechanization level of Albanian agricultural production is increasingly improving. Large agricultural machinery such as tractors and combine harvesters are widely used in the plains.

    思想革命化运动深入开展大大推动农业生产发展
    阿尔巴尼亚去年农业生产成就巨大
    山区尚未合作化的农民不到三个月迅速走上集体化道路
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，去年在争取农业丰收，特别是粮食自给的斗争中，取得了巨大的成就。
    去年年初，阿尔巴尼亚山区尚未合作化的农民，积极响应劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，在不到三个月的时间内，便迅速地走上了社会主义集体化的道路，成立了五百多个农业生产合作社。广大农业生产合作社的社员还响应卢什涅区斯大林合作社和费里区恩维尔·霍查合作社的倡议，自愿减少社员自留地和自留牲畜。国营农场工人也响应地拉那季米特洛夫国营农场的倡议，自动地取消了自留地和自留牲畜。农业合作社和国营农场的干部更加积极地参加集体生产劳动。
    广大农业劳动者响应霍查同志去年二月六日的讲话，积极开展了反对官僚主义、宗教迷信、落后习俗等群众性运动。思想革命化运动的深入开展，大大推动了农业生产的发展。
    去年的农业总产值将比前年增长百分之十二的计划预计可超额完成，其中粮食的生产计划已超额完成。小麦的单位面积产量达到了阿尔巴尼亚历史上最高的水平。玉米著名产区迪勃拉的农业劳动者，去年超额百分之十三完成了粮食生产计划，比原计划多生产粮食二万六千六百公担。过去认为不能保证粮食自给的一些山区，去年也第一次做到了粮食自给。
    去年全国的开荒计划已完成百分之一百一十八。此外，农业劳动者在水利灌溉、平整土地、改良土壤等方面也取得了显著的成绩。同前年相比，农田所施化肥增长了五倍，有机肥料增长了百分之二十。
    去年以来，广大农业劳动者还响应劳动党的号召，进行了二千六百项科学实验，特别是进行了关于增产粮食的科学实验。由于科学实验的结果，使全国高产田的面积比前年增长了三倍。迪勃拉区播种的七千五百公顷玉米，平均每公顷的产量达二十四公担。科尔察区的一个农场在六百公顷的土地上，每公顷收获小麦四十二公担。都拉斯区十五个合作社播种的六百五十公顷水稻，获得了平均单位产量五十二公担的大面积丰收。
    广大农业合作社社员在思想和生产双丰收的基础上，踊跃向国家交纳公粮和交售剩余的农畜产品。到去年十一月底，斯库台、费里、吉诺卡斯特、萨兰达等许多区已经完成了交粮任务。
    去年的秋播面积也比前年扩大了三万三千公顷，超额完成了播种计划。
    现在，许多农业劳动者正在利用冬闲，积极地继续学习劳动党五大文件和霍查同志的讲话，进一步开展思想革命化。与此同时，全国广大农业合作社社员和国营农场的工人正在冒着冬季的严寒进行开荒、深耕、兴修水利、积肥等工作，力争今年夺取更大的丰收。（附图片）
    随着工业建设的发展，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产的机械化程度日益提高，拖拉机、联合收割机等大型农业机械在平原地区已普遍使用。图为卢什涅区毛泽东农业生产合作社社员在收割小麦。
