British imperialism, undeterred by its failures, is continuing its aggression in the Middle East. It is now scheming to form a so-called "common defense" group in the Arabian Gulf (Persian Gulf) region, which is rich in oil. This plot has been met with strong opposition from Arab countries.

According to British newspapers, the British government has recently dispatched "Wilson's envoy," Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Goronwy Roberts, to the Arabian Gulf region to engage in active diplomacy. On the 7th, Roberts held talks in Tehran, the capital of Iran, with the Shah and the Foreign Minister, urging Iran to join Britain's planned "common defense" scheme in the Arabian Gulf. He then hurriedly traveled to Kuwait, Bahrain, and Muscat, Oman, and on the 10th, held talks in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with King Faisal. According to Western news agencies, the countries Britain aims to draw into this "common defense" plan include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and some emirates in the Arabian Gulf.

Since being expelled from South Yemen by the people after a long struggle last November, British imperialism has not accepted defeat. It is now making a desperate effort to maintain its colonial interests, particularly its oil interests, in the Arabian Gulf region. On one hand, British imperialism has transferred part of its colonial troops and military facilities from South Yemen to the strategically and economically important Arabian Gulf, strengthening its military bases there. On the other hand, it is pushing for a "new type of regional defense pact" in the region. Currently, Britain has military bases in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Muscat in the Arabian Gulf.

However, the British imperialist plot to form a so-called Arabian Gulf "common defense" plan has been met with strong condemnation and opposition from Arab public opinion as soon as it was revealed.

Iraqi newspapers have recently published a series of commentaries strongly condemning the British imperialist plan as an attempt to establish a new counter-revolutionary front in the Arab world, reviving the infamous "Baghdad Pact."

The Iraqi newspaper *Al-Muwatin* published a commentary on the 11th stating that Britain aims to "protect its colonial interests in the Arabian Gulf" through the so-called "common defense" plan. The commentary pointed out:

"The attempt to revive the 'Baghdad Pact' in the Arabian Gulf is part of the imperialist and reactionary attack on the Arab revolution." The commentary said that the Arab people will not be deceived by such old tricks and will foil the imperialist plot, driving imperialism out of the Arabian Gulf.

The student organization in Bahrain also issued a statement on the 10th condemning the British imperialist plan for a so-called "common defense." The statement said that this is "a conspiracy being carried out by the imperialist bloc."

Faced with widespread opposition from Arab public opinion, the British newspaper *Daily Telegraph* had to admit that British imperialism's so-called "common defense" plan in the region has encountered numerous obstacles. The newspaper said that any regional alliance, no matter how loose, would face strong opposition from the Arab world.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London on the 19th, after being forced to announce the early withdrawal of colonial troops from Southeast Asia and the Middle East, as well as other "cost-cutting" plans, Western bourgeois newspapers generally acknowledged that this is a sign of British imperialism's further decline. They lamented: "Britain's status as a great power has ended," and Britain is no longer "Great Britain," but only "Little England."

British newspapers have expressed widespread dismay over Wilson's announced plans, deeming these measures to save Britain's political and economic crises as "disappointing" and "unable to change anything." *The Guardian* said that these measures did not "outline a clear path to economic recovery." *The Daily Express* even cursed Wilson as "shameful" and accused Wilson's proposed measures as a "declaration of bankruptcy."

    英帝国主义侵略中东贼心不死
    阴谋在阿拉伯湾地区拼凑“共同防务”集团
    阿拉伯各国舆论猛烈抨击英帝企图在阿拉伯建立新的反革命阵线
    新华社讯　英帝国主义为了进一步加紧对盛产石油的阿拉伯湾
  （波斯湾）地区的控制，镇压那里蓬勃发展的民族解放运动，正阴谋在这一地区拼凑一个所谓“共同防务”计划。英国的这一阴谋遭到阿拉伯国家舆论的强烈反对。
    据英国报纸透露：英国政府最近派遣了“威尔逊的使者”、协办外交事务国务大臣戈伦韦·罗伯茨到阿拉伯湾地区积极活动。罗伯茨七日在伊朗首都德黑兰同伊朗国王和外交大臣举行会谈，要伊朗参加英国在阿拉伯湾地区策划的所谓“共同防务”计划。接着他又匆匆赶往科威特、巴林和麦什哈特阿曼活动，并于十日在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得同沙特阿拉伯国王费萨尔举行了会谈。据西方通讯社透露，英国企图拉进这个“共同防务”计划的国家包括伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、科威特、巴林和阿拉伯湾的一些酋长国。
    英帝国主义从去年十一月被经过长期斗争的南也门人民赶出南也门以后，并不甘心于它的失败，正在进行垂死挣扎，竭力想要维持它在阿拉伯湾地区的殖民利益，特别是石油利益。一方面，英帝国主义把从南也门撤走的一部分殖民军和军事设施转移到具有重要战略和经济地位的阿拉伯湾，加强它在阿拉伯湾的军事基地，一方面又在这一地区搞什么“新型的地区防御协定”。目前，英国在阿拉伯湾的巴林群岛、卡塔尔、阿曼和麦什哈特阿曼都有军事基地。
    但是，英帝国主义策划拼凑所谓阿拉伯湾“共同防务”计划的阴谋刚一露头，就遭到阿拉伯国家舆论的强烈谴责和反对。
    伊拉克报纸最近接连发表评论，强烈谴责英帝策划的这个“共同防务”计划是企图在阿拉伯建立新的反革命阵线，使臭名昭著的“巴格达条约”死灰复燃。
    伊拉克报纸《公民报》十一日发表评论指出，英国想要通过拼凑所谓“共同防务”计划来“保护它在阿拉伯湾的殖民利益”。评论指出：
  “企图在阿拉伯湾复活‘巴格达条约’，是帝国主义和反动派对阿拉伯革命发动攻击的一个组成部分。”评论说，阿拉伯人民决不会被这种老一套鬼把戏所欺骗，他们将挫败帝国主义的这一阴谋，把帝国主义从阿拉伯湾赶出去。
    巴林群岛在伊拉克的学生组织也在十日发表声明，谴责英帝策划的所谓“共同防务”计划。声明说，这是“帝国主义集团正在进行的一个阴谋”。
    在阿拉伯国家舆论纷纷反对面前，英国报纸《每日电讯报》也不得不承认，英帝国主义在这一地区搞所谓“共同防务”计划，遇到重重阻力。这家报纸说，缔结任何地区性的联盟，不管它是多么松弛，都将遭到阿拉伯世界的强烈反对。
    据新华社伦敦十九日电　英国政府被迫宣布提前从东南亚和中东撤出殖民军以及其他“削减开支”的计划后，西方资产阶级报刊普遍承认，这是英帝国主义进一步走向没落的标志。它们哀叹：“英国作为大国的地位已告结束”，英国已经不再是“大不列颠”，而只是“小英格兰”了。
    英国报刊对于威尔逊所宣布的计划发出一片悲鸣，它们认为这些企图挽救英国政治、经济危机的措施是令人“失望的”，是“改变不了什么”的。《卫报》说，这些措施没有“标划出明显的恢复经济发展的道路”；《每日快报》甚至破口大骂威尔逊“可耻”，并指责威尔逊提出的这些措施是一项“破产申请书”。
