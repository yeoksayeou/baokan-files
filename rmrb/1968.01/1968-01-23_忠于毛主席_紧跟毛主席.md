The reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a major enemy on the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely defeat it!

The comrades from the Beijing Knitting Factory have a deep understanding of this: only by defeating factionalism can we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; only by strictly demanding of ourselves with the great principle of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao can we consciously defeat factionalism.

In the current situation, whether or not one can consciously defeat factionalism is a severe test for members of revolutionary mass organizations, especially for leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. If you are a genuine proletarian revolutionary who is loyal to Chairman Mao, then you should consciously wage a struggle against the "self" and consciously break with factionalism. If the leaders of your organization continue to engage in factionalism, you should follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "harmful leadership to the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted but should be resolutely resisted." Do not blindly follow the factionalism of the leaders, but actively resist factionalism and resolutely struggle against it.

Now is the time to launch a "people's war" to eliminate factionalism. All proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end should, in this struggle, thoroughly defeat factionalism, establish party spirit, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Loyal to Chairman Mao, Follow Chairman Mao Closely

Xing Yunyou, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory

I was originally a leader of the "Red Rebels" in the Beijing Knitting Factory. In the struggle to eliminate factionalism, I deeply felt that only by strictly demanding of myself with the great principle of being loyal to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao closely can I uphold the principles of the proletarian party and consciously defeat factionalism.

Last September, with the help of the support team from the 834th Unit, we achieved a great alliance of the entire factory. At that time, I still had factionalism in my mind. When selecting the service teams in various workshops, I thought: the workshop is the grassroots level, the front line, the most important, and we must "maintain superiority" and not let the other side "eat us up." Otherwise, if the alliance breaks down, our faction will suffer. We leaders discussed and decided to go to the workshops to secretly arrange for our faction to compete for seats and leadership positions. As a result, several workshops formed a stalemate during the selection process, and the service teams could not be formed for a long time, affecting the progress of the revolutionary alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

This incident made me feel torn. Not competing would mean our faction would suffer; competing would mean Chairman Mao's latest instructions could not be implemented. What should I do?

With the help of the PLA comrades, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. Chairman Mao taught us: "We should make every comrade understand that all words and actions of communists must take the greatest benefit to the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." "We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every party member, every part of the work, every speech or action, must take the interests of the whole party as the starting point and absolutely not violate this principle." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me the standard for handling issues. Only considering the gains and losses of our faction violates the principle of "considering the overall situation"; strictly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is to take the interests of the whole party as the starting point and to be in line with the greatest benefit to the broadest masses of the people. A leader of a revolutionary mass organization, if he says he acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions but does things that only benefit his faction, that is disloyal to Chairman Mao and cannot closely follow Chairman Mao!

The PLA comrades repeatedly enlightened us: to handle issues, we must act according to Mao Zedong Thought, consider the overall situation, look forward, and not just see the little benefit under our noses. The leader of the support team also said to me: "You are the core group leader of the 'Great Alliance Committee,' you can't be of this faction or that faction, but you must be a revolutionary of Mao Zedong Thought!"

The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the arrangement to compete for seats and leadership positions was completely wrong. I took the initiative to go to the relevant workshops to make a self-criticism to my faction's comrades, explaining that in order to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we should not only not compete but also give way. Some departments had already gained an absolute majority of seats, and we gave up the quotas and readjusted the leadership team.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the PLA comrades organized the 15 members of the factory's revolutionary alliance committee to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, focusing on eliminating factionalism and exposing and criticizing selfishness. At the beginning, I was not conscious of fighting selfishness, thinking that the main mistakes were on the other side, and that fighting selfishness was mainly their business. At the same time, I was worried that if we exposed our factional activities, we would be criticized by our own faction and be caught by the other side. Therefore, I planned to adopt the method of "equal exchange": if you don't fight, I won't fight; if you fight so much, I will fight so much.

With the help of the PLA comrades, after studying the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, and learning from the experience of Mao Zedong's good soldier Nian Siwang in "fighting the 'self' at every moment," my thoughts gradually became clear. Looking back at the situation of factionalism and "internal war" over the past few months, my "self" was not just a momentary thought but a whole basket.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" Why can't I give up my "self"? Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructed us: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." Why can't I regard myself as the object of the revolution? In the end, whether or not to thoroughly expose and criticize selfishness is the question of whether or not to sincerely implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism"; whether or not to dare to take the initiative to expose and criticize selfishness is the fundamental attitude of loyalty to Chairman Mao. As the core group leader of the "Great Alliance Committee," I did not take the lead in fighting selfishness but wanted to engage in "equal exchange" in fighting selfishness. Can this be said to be closely following Chairman Mao? In the end, it is the "self" that blinded my eyes and factionalism that bewitched my mind. Later, I made up my mind: this time, I will fight selfishness and leave nothing behind, and I will turn over the whole thing!

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, I exposed all my factional activities, such as how I arranged for the workshops to compete for seats and leadership positions, and criticized them. Later, I also exposed and criticized selfishness with the comrades of the "Great Alliance Committee" at the factory-wide mass meeting.

What we did played a significant role in eliminating factionalism throughout the factory. However, due to the factionalism we had instilled in the past, when it came to the formation of the factory revolutionary committee, some of the masses from our faction opposed the method of consulting and recommending candidates and then voting for the final election, proposing that candidates be voted for when they are produced. In fact, they wanted to use our faction's advantage of having more people to vote out the candidates from the other side.

This thought, I originally had it too. After fighting selfishness in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, I realized that the thought of excluding the other side was wrong. Excluding the other side would also not be able to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the principle of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat." Therefore, I went to the masses with such thoughts and persuaded them to eliminate factionalism, consider the overall situation, and not use the majority to oppress the minority.

At the beginning, my opinions were met with opposition. Some said: "The higher our attitude, the less power we have, so we might as well give it all to them!" Some said: "The milk of the masses raised you, and you have forgotten your roots!" Others said: "Don't be so beautiful, don't think you will definitely be elected, we will pull you down from below if we work together!" At that time, I thought: to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must believe firmly and unwaveringly, this is the highest principle, and we cannot waver when encountering obstacles. The factionalism among the masses is what we leaders have instilled in the past, and we have the responsibility to eliminate the influence of factionalism. Therefore, I continued to persist in doing ideological work among the masses. After the candidates were produced through consultation, I went to the lower levels to mobilize the comrades from our faction who were originally there, not to bring factionalism to the election of the committee members, and to elect those who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regardless of which faction they are from.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought defeated factionalism. Our factory revolutionary committee was finally born in victory!

This series of facts deeply educated me. I am determined to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao, fight selfishness, and establish public-mindedness, and contribute all my strength to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, take the lead in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and promote the revolutionization of thought.

### 忠于毛主席　紧跟毛主席

专栏：

    编者按：反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是当前无产阶级文化大革命前进路上的大敌。我们有坚决打倒它的必要！
    北京针织总厂的同志对此有深刻的体会：只有打倒派性，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；只有用无限忠于毛主席的革命大节严格要求自己，才能自觉地打倒派性。
    在目前形势下，能不能自觉地打倒派性，已是革命群众组织的成员，特别是革命群众组织的负责人，面临的一场严峻考验。你是真正忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命派，那么，你就应当自觉地狠斗“私”字，自觉地同派性决裂；如果本组织的负责人继续闹派性，你也应当遵照毛主席关于“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制”的教导，不是盲目地去跟着头头的派性转，而是积极抵制派性，坚决同派性作斗争。
    现在，已到了打一场围剿派性的“人民战争”的时候了。一切决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，都应当在这场斗争中大破派性，大立党性，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功！
    忠于毛主席　紧跟毛主席
    北京针织总厂革命委员会副主任　邢云有
    我原是北京针织总厂“红色造反者”的负责人。在破除派性的斗争中，我深深体会到：只有用忠于毛主席、紧跟毛主席的革命大节严格要求自己，才能坚持无产阶级党性原则，自觉地打倒派性。
    去年九月份，我们在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，实现了全厂革命的大联合。当时，我思想上还有派性。在各车间推选勤务组时，心想：车间是基层，是第一线，最关重要，必须“保持优势”，不能让对方“吃掉”。不然，万一联合破裂了，自己一派会吃亏。我们几个负责人一商量，分头到车间里找我们这一派的人单线布置：要争席位，争组长。结果，好几个车间在推选时形成僵局，勤务组迟迟产生不出来，影响了革命大联合和革命“三结合”的进展。
    这件事使我左右为难。不争吧，怕自己这派吃亏；争下去吧，眼看着毛主席的最新指示落实不了。怎么办呢？
    在解放军同志帮助下，我又反复学习毛主席的有关指示。毛主席教导我们：“应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”毛主席这些教导，给了我处理问题的标尺。只考虑我们这一派吃亏、沾光，就违反“顾全大局”的原则；不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示，才是以全党利益为出发点，才能合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益。一个革命群众组织负责人，如果口头上也说按照毛主席的指示办事，做的却是只顾派别的利益，那就是对毛主席不忠，那就不能紧跟毛主席！
    解放军同志一再启发我们：处理问题要按照毛泽东思想办事，要顾全大局，要往前看，不能只看到自己鼻子尖下的一点利益。支左部队的负责同志还对我说：“你是‘大联委’核心组组长，可不能做这派那派，而是要做毛泽东思想革命派！”
    越想越觉得布置下面争席位、争组长的作法，完全错了。我便主动到有关车间向自己一派的同志作检讨，说明为了坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，我们不但不该争，而且应该让。有的部门已经争到了绝对优势的席位，我们让出名额，把领导班子重新作了调整。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，解放军同志组织厂里无产阶级革命派大联合委员会的十五名委员，参加毛泽东思想学习班，围绕破除派性，亮私斗私。开始，我对斗私很不自觉，自认为错误主要在对方，斗私主要是他们的事，同时担心把我们的派性活动亮出来，会受到自己一派的埋怨，会被对方抓住辫子……。所以，准备采取“等价交换”的办法：你不斗，我也不斗；你斗多少，我斗多少。
    在解放军同志帮助下，经过学习“老五篇”和毛主席关于批评与自我批评的教导，学习毛主席的好战士年四旺“狠斗‘私’字一闪念”的经验，思想逐渐开朗。回想几个月来闹派性、打“内战”的情况，自己的“私”字不是一闪念，而是一大筐。
    毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我为什么就舍不得丢掉自己的“私”字？林彪副主席指示我们：“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”我为什么就不能把自己当作革命的对象？归根到底，愿不愿彻底亮私斗私，是想不想忠实地执行毛主席的“要斗私，批修”这一伟大指示的问题；敢不敢主动亮私斗私，是忠不忠于毛主席的根本态度问题。我作为“大联委”的核心组组长，不去带头斗私，而是想在斗私上搞“等价交换”，这能说是紧跟毛主席吗？说来说去，还是“私”字蒙住了眼睛，派性迷住了心窍。后来，我下定决心：这次斗私，一定连筐底也不留，来个全盘端！
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，我把自己如何布置车间争席位、争组长等派性活动，一古脑儿端了出来，并作了批判。后来，又和“大联委”的同志们一起，到全厂群众大会上亮私斗私。
    我们这样做，对于在全厂消除派性起了不小的作用。可是，由于我们过去灌的派性太多，到酝酿产生厂革命委员会的时候，原来我们这一派的群众，有人反对上下结合协商提候选人、最后投票选举的办法，提出产生候选人时就投票选举。实际上，是想利用我们这一派人多的优势，把对方候选人选掉。
    这种思想，我原来也有。经过在毛泽东思想学习班里斗私，认识到排斥对方的思想，是错误的。排斥了对方，也就不能落实毛主席这一最新指示：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。”于是，我就到有这种想法的群众中去，说服他们要破除派性，顾全大局，不要以大压小。
    开始的时候，我这些意见遭到了反对。有的说：“我们姿态越高，权越少，干脆都让给人家算了！”有的说：“群众的奶水把你养大了，你就忘本了！”还有人说：“你不用美，别以为你准能选上，我们在下边一和弄就把你拉下来！”
    当时，我想：贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，要坚信不疑，坚定不移，这是最高原则，不能遇到阻力就动摇。群众中的派性，是我们头头过去灌输的，自己有责任去消除派性的影响。于是，我继续坚持对群众做思想工作。在候选人协商产生以后，我又到下面动员原来我们这一派的同志，选举委员不要带派性，只要是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的人，不管是那一派的，都应当选。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想战胜了派性。我厂革命委员会终于胜利诞生了！
    这一系列事实深深教育了我。我决心永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示贡献一切力量！（附图片）
    北京针织总厂革命委员会的委员们，坚决响应毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的战斗号召，以毛泽东思想为武器，带头斗私批修，促进思想革命化。
