“Wrongs have a source, debts have a master.” The Chinese Khrushchev is the mastermind behind the attempt to restore capitalism in China's countryside, and the chief culprit in advocating the “free market.”

In 1961, the Chinese Khrushchev openly stated: “The free market must still be run… Don’t be afraid of the spread of capitalism.” Once his black words were out, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in our region also started spreading nonsense, saying: “With the free market, there will be more goods, and the market will be more lively.” With the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, all sorts of evil elements in society came out, colluding with the class enemies who had infiltrated the party, conspiring together to spread the black wind of free buying and selling and speculation in the countryside.

In our production brigade, some people, for the sake of making money, abandoned farming and went into business. They not only peddled ordinary agricultural and sideline products but also took collective production items like hemp and cotton, which are industrial raw materials, to the free market to sell at high prices. Besides selling locally, they also went to distant places to engage in long-distance trading.

The rampant freedom of the “free market” has caused serious harm in the countryside. First, the state quotas for hemp and cotton cannot be fulfilled, affecting national construction and damaging the alliance between workers and peasants. Second, the collective economy is weakened, and even phenomena like the brigade having no money to buy fertilizer and having to borrow high-interest loans from individuals appear. Third, there is a polarization. Those who engage in speculation and profiteering build new houses, buy watches, purchase bicycles, and squander money; while those poor and lower-middle peasants with less labor power and more people face difficulties in life because the collective income is low. If we follow the path of the Chinese Khrushchev, it won’t take long for the whole country to change color and return to the old road of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism.

The free market advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a bloodless slaughterer, a poisoned arrow shot at socialism. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, our awareness has been raised. The evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchev have been exposed and pierced through by the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone hates the Chinese Khrushchev even more, and loves our great leader Chairman Mao even more. Everyone unanimously agrees that only by following Chairman Mao’s words and developing the socialist collective economy can we tread the bright path. We are determined to wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, smash the Chinese Khrushchev to pieces, making sure he never rises again!

### “自由市场”是杀人不见血的屠刀

    “自由市场”是杀人不见血的屠刀
    九堡大队十四生产队长　朱百正
      “冤有头，债有主。”中国赫鲁晓夫是妄图在我国农村复辟资本主义的总后台，是鼓吹“自由市场”的罪魁祸首。
    在一九六一年，中国赫鲁晓夫露骨地说：“自由市场还是要搞下去的……不要怕资本主义泛滥。”他的黑话一出笼，我们地区党内一小撮走资派，也跟着胡说什么：“有了自由市场，东西就多了，市场就活跃了。”在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，社会上牛鬼蛇神纷纷跑了出来，同钻进党内的阶级敌人上下勾结，串通一气，在农村大刮自由买卖、投机倒把的黑风。
    在我们生产队里，有的人为了赚钞票，就弃农经商，外出做生意。他们不但贩运一般农副产品，甚至把集体生产的络麻、棉花等工业原料，也拿到自由市场上去高价出售。除了在本地贩卖外，还到外地去进行远途贩销。
      “自由市场”的自由泛滥，在农村造成严重的恶果。第一，络麻、棉花的国家任务完不成，影响国家建设，损害工农联盟。第二，集体经济受到削弱，甚至出现队里买化肥没有资金，向私人借高利贷的现象。第三，出现两极分化。搞投机倒把的人，家里造新屋、买手表、购脚踏车，乱吃乱用；而劳力少、人口多的贫下中农，则因为集体收入少，生活困难。如果照中国赫鲁晓夫这条路走下去，不要多少时间，整个国家就会改变颜色，回到半殖民地半封建的老路上去。
    中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的大搞“自由市场”，是一把杀人不见血的屠刀，是一支射向社会主义的毒箭。通过革命的大批判，提高了我们的觉悟，中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶阴谋已被用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农识破了，戳穿了。大家对中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋更加恨之入骨，对我们伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱。大家一致认为，只有听毛主席的话，发展社会主义集体经济，才是光明大道。我们决心奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，在政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫打个落花流水，使他永世不得翻身！
