The vast central plains have echoed with a stirring victory song. In the midst of welcoming the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been gloriously born. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is a bountiful fruit of implementing Mao Zedong's latest instructions.

With boundless joy, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Henan, to the 50 million people of Henan with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and to the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Henan.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in Henan Province once again prove this truth. The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, through their agents Wen Mingeng and Zhao Wenfu in Henan, had obstinately pursued a bourgeois reactionary line that opposed Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and they madly carried out activities to restore capitalism. Facing the white terror of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in Henan firmly believed that the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought would surely shine over the central plains. In the most difficult times, they always studied and applied Mao Zedong's works, quickly spread Mao Zedong's voice, and followed Mao Zedong's great strategic deployments. It is the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought that, at every critical moment, pointed out the direction for them to advance, inspiring them to brave the dark winds and fierce waves, and to engage in a relentless struggle against the class enemy, achieving one victory after another throughout the province.

"Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit. This must be resolved." Mao Zedong's great teaching has been brilliantly embodied in Henan. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Henan, in the matter of cadres, had long pursued a bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they, in order to protect a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, even more viciously struck down and persecuted revolutionary cadres who insisted on Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Henan, through their own struggle practice, deeply understood that revolutionary cadres are a precious asset of our party, and protecting revolutionary leading cadres is to defend Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. Therefore, in handling the matter of cadres, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat have always stood firm and clear in their stance. They have mercilessly exposed and criticized the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, seized their power, and overthrown their rule; they have warmly helped good revolutionary leading cadres to correct their mistakes and resolutely supported them in coming out to revolution. The reason why a large number of revolutionary leading cadres in Henan Province have been able to come out is inseparable from the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat correctly implementing Mao Zedong's cadre policy throughout the province. Therefore, whether revolutionary masses organizations dare to revolutionize against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and whether they dare to support genuine revolutionary leading cadres is an important indicator of whether they have a proletarian stance, sentiment, and style.

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Henan are loyal to Mao Zedong, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. Whatever Mao Zedong says, they do; wherever Mao Zedong points, they fight. They follow Mao Zedong's teachings, stand firm, and hold high their banner. At critical moments, they step forward, strongly supporting the leftist broad revolutionary masses. They fight together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, win together, and have made great contributions to promoting the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Henan Province.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Henan Province, as Mao Zedong pointed out, is "better than ever before." The entire province, on all fronts, presents a new and inspiring situation. We hope that the revolutionary committee of Henan Province, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and the broad revolutionary masses will take Mao Zedong's latest instructions as the guideline, earnestly run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, especially to vigorously promote the great alliance of revolution by system, by industry, and by class, seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

We believe that after the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Henan will definitely be even better! The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be held even higher!

    辽阔中原唱凯歌
    ——热烈欢呼河南省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    辽阔的中原大地传来了振奋人心的凯歌。在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的热潮中，河南省革命委员会光荣诞生了。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一个伟大胜利，这是落实毛主席最新指示的丰硕成果。
    我们怀着无限喜悦的心情，向河南的广大无产阶级革命派和具有光荣革命传统的河南省五千万人民，向人民解放军驻河南部队广大指战员，致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”无产阶级文化大革命以来，河南省发生的翻天覆地的变化，再一次证明了这一真理。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸在河南地区的代理人文敏生、赵文甫之流，曾经顽固地推行一条与毛主席无产阶级革命路线相对抗的资产阶级反动路线，疯狂地进行资本主义复辟活动。面对着中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，河南省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，坚信毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光一定会照彻中原大地。他们在最困难的时候，始终活学活用毛主席著作，迅速传播毛主席的声音，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。正是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在每一个关键时刻给他们指明了前进的航向，鼓舞着他们顶黑风，战恶浪，和阶级敌人进行艰苦卓绝的斗争，在全省范围内获得了一个又一个的胜利。
    “正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”毛主席的这一伟大教导，在河南地区得到了光辉的体现。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南地区的代理人，在干部问题上，长期以来，就实行一条“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们为了保护党内一小撮走资派，更是变本加厉地打击和迫害坚持毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命的领导干部。河南省的无产阶级革命派，在自己的斗争实践中深深地懂得：革命干部是我们党的宝贵财富，保护革命领导干部，也就是保卫毛主席的革命路线。因此，在对待干部问题上，广大无产阶级革命派始终立场坚定、爱憎分明。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，毫不留情地揭露他们，批判他们，夺他们的权，革他们的命；对真正好的革命领导干部，热情地帮助他们改正错误，坚决支持他们站出来革命。河南省大批革命领导干部所以能够站出来，是和全省的无产阶级革命派正确地执行毛主席的干部政策分不开的。因此，对党内一小撮走资派敢不敢革命，对真正的革命领导干部敢不敢支持，是一个革命群众组织有没有无产阶级的立场、感情和风格的重要标志之一。
    人民解放军驻河南部队广大指战员，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。毛主席指到哪里，他们就打到哪里。他们遵循毛主席的教导，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，在关键时刻挺身而出，大力支持左派广大革命群众。他们和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。他们为推动河南省无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展建立了很大的功绩。
    目前，河南省无产阶级文化大革命的形势正如毛主席指出的那样，“比以往任何时候都好”。整个河南省，各条战线都呈现了令人鼓舞的新气象。我们希望河南省的革命委员会，河南省的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，切实办好毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和三结合，特别要大力促进按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，为从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
    我们相信，河南省革命委员会成立以后，河南的无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产必将搞得更好、更好！毛泽东思想的伟大红旗必将举得更高、更高！
