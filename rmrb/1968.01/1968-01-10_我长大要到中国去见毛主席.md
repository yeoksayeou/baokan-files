A French woman was deeply moved after receiving a Chinese magazine sent by her Chinese friend. In her reply to her Chinese friend, she wrote: "I have boundless love and admiration for the noble and brave Chinese people who are carrying out revolutionary struggles under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Although we are thousands of miles apart, our hearts are forever connected."

She mentioned in her letter a particular incident: her 13-year-old son often dreams of visiting China one day. Her son frequently says, "When I grow up, I will go to China to see Chairman Mao Zedong and embrace the great Chinese people."

    我长大要到中国去见毛主席
    一位法国妇女在接到中国朋友给她寄来的一本中国杂志后，心里非常激动。她在向中国朋友致谢的回信中说：“我无限热爱和敬仰在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下进行革命斗争的高尚而又勇敢的中国人民。虽然我们相隔千里，但是我们永远心连心。”
    她在信中特别谈到这样一件事：她的十三岁的儿子经常想着有一天能访问中国。她的儿子常常把这句话挂在嘴边：“我长大时要到中国去见毛泽东主席，拥抱伟大的中国人民。”
