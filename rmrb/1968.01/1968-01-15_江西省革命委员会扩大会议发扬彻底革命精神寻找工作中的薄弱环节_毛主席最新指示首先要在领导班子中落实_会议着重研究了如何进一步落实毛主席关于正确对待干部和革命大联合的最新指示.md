The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting the day after its establishment to earnestly study, deeply understand, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This meeting carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, proactively identified weak links in the work, and formulated revolutionary measures to address these issues, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are thoroughly implemented. The meeting aimed to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All participants at this expanded meeting recalled the victorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi. They unanimously pointed out that the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must clearly see that in some local areas and certain units, our work still has weak links. The tasks ahead are more arduous and greater. We must not have any complacency or self-satisfaction. We must not be self-satisfied. We must continue to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and continue the revolution to advance victorious, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better.

The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee grasped this fundamental issue and organized all attending comrades at the first expanded meeting to focus their efforts on deeply studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the New Year editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee believed that the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions should first be implemented within the leading cadres. When the leadership is tight, the masses will follow closely. Therefore, in addition to all committee members participating in the meeting, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee also invited the main leading cadres of various prefectures, counties, and cities' temporary power organs, as well as representatives and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and Red Guards, to participate in the meeting. Thus, the first expanded meeting was also a grand meeting for studying, applying, implementing, and carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions among all levels of leading cadres in the province. All participants at the expanded meeting held Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studied them word by word, repeatedly understood them, and connected them with reality, self-examined, and identified weak links. After finding the weak links, everyone put themselves in the situation, connected with their own thoughts, dug out the root causes of the weak links, fought against selfishness, and established public-mindedness, further rooting Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply in their minds. Everyone regarded the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a process of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, achieving immediate effects. The meeting is still ongoing. All participants are determined to find weak links in all aspects of the work and better comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

"Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This must be resolved." Participants at the expanded meeting, following Chairman Mao's teachings, focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, summarized achievements, and identified gaps. Currently, a large number of revolutionary leading cadres have been released in various places across the province, and six prefectures and more than 80% of counties and cities have established revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs. However, in a few regions or units, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on correctly handling cadres have not been well implemented or seriously carried out. Everyone traced the root cause and believed that the reason for this situation is that they still do not trust the majority of cadres, fearing that cadres will come out to retaliate, fearing being labeled as "rightist," which is actually selfishness at work. Comrades from Yichun said that whether cadres can be correctly handled is a matter of whether to implement or not implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, whether to follow or not follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and a touchstone to test loyalty to Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, educate, and unite the majority of cadres. Comrades from Ganzhou revisited Chairman Mao's teachings on "for those party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated, regardless of their origin, they should be educated rather than abandoned." They deeply realized that they should, with a broad mind of genuine proletarian revolutionaries, strive to save cadres and help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They followed Chairman Mao's proposed method of identifying cadres, "not only looking at a cadre's temporary actions but also looking at the cadre's entire history and work," to conduct a comprehensive and historical analysis of the leading cadres in their region who have not yet been released, and immediately sent people back to the prefecture to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues.

How to further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance is an important issue at present. Participants at the expanded meeting focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving the revolutionary great alliance and summarized and examined the situation of the great alliance. Currently, six prefectures, one city, and more than 90% of counties in the province have achieved revolutionary great alliances by system, industry, and class, with the situation being exceptionally good. However, in some local areas and a few units, there are still "internal wars" among revolutionary factions, and they cannot unite. In some places, there is still the issue of how to correctly handle old revolutionary rebels who have made some mistakes. Comrades from Ji'an and Fuzhou, where the revolutionary great alliance is relatively consolidated, said that to eliminate differences between the two factions and achieve revolutionary great alliance, the fundamental thing is to break with selfishness and act according to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: "The two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." We must definitely help the two factions act according to this teaching of Chairman Mao. We must use proletarian party spirit to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and promote the two factions to achieve revolutionary great alliance under the principle of revolution; those who have already united should further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance.

All participants at the meeting felt more enthusiastic and enlightened the more they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone studied while taking action, forming a hot tide of quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The leading cadres of the temporary leadership organ of Fuzhou returned to Fuzhou during the meeting to convey the meeting's spirit and gains, immediately launching a great propaganda, study, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the entire region. Comrades from Nanchang used their evening rest time to return to their original units to convey their study experiences and insights, promoting the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their units. The two leaders of revolutionary mass organizations from Dexing County, through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, made self-criticisms, eliminated hostile emotions, and signed an agreement on achieving revolutionary great alliance at the meeting. Under their influence, some leaders of mass organizations in Shangrao that had not yet achieved revolutionary great alliance called their original units, requesting their organizations to negotiate with the other side for unity. Some even invited the relevant leaders of the two factions to Nanchang to discuss the issue of great alliance.

Under the promotion of the expanded meeting of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, a hot tide of great study, great propaganda, and great implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions emerged in various places in Jiangxi. The children of Jinggangshan are determined to turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their souls and actions, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    江西省革命委员会扩大会议发扬彻底革命精神寻找工作中的薄弱环节
    毛主席最新指示首先要在领导班子中落实
    会议着重研究了如何进一步落实毛主席关于正确对待干部和革命大联合的最新指示
    据新华社南昌十四日电　江西省革命委员会成立的第二天，立即召开扩大会议，认真学习、深刻领会、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。这次会议发扬井冈山的彻底革命精神，以高姿态主动寻找工作中的薄弱环节，针对薄弱环节制订革命措施，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    参加这次扩大会议的全体同志回忆了江西无产阶级文化大革命的胜利历程，一致激动地指出，江西省无产阶级文化大革命取得的决定性胜利，是毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命一系列极为重要指示落实的成果，光荣属于伟大领袖毛主席。我们必须清醒地看到，在局部地区，在某些单位，我们的工作还有薄弱环节。今后的任务更艰巨、更伟大，我们不能有半点骄傲自满情绪，决不能固步自封。一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬成绩，克服缺点，不断革命，乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。省革委会抓住这个根本，在第一次扩大会议上组织全体到会同志，集中精力，深入学习毛主席的一系列最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论。省革委会认为，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，首先要在领导班子里落实。领导跟得紧，群众就跟得紧。因此，除了全体委员参加会议外，省革委会还召集各专区、县、市临时权力机构的主要领导成员，以及革命群众组织、红卫兵革命小将的负责人和代表参加了会议。这样，第一次扩大会议，也就是毛主席最新指示在全省各级领导干部中的一次大学习、大运用、大落实、大贯彻的大会。参加扩大会议的全体同志手捧毛主席的最新指示，逐字逐句地学习，反复领会，并且联系实际，对照检查，寻找薄弱环节。在找到薄弱环节后，大家又把自己摆进去，联系自己的思想实际，挖出产生薄弱环节的思想根源，狠斗私字，大立公字，进一步把毛主席的最新指示在头脑里牢牢地扎下根来。大家把落实毛主席最新指示的过程作为斗私、批修的过程，收到了立竿见影的效果。现在，这次会议还正在进行当中。与会同志决心找出各方面工作中的薄弱环节，更好地全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
      “正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”参加扩大会议的同志遵照毛主席的教导，重点地学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，总结了成绩，寻找了差距。目前，全省各地都有一大批革命领导干部解放出来，六个专区和百分之八十以上的县、市都已建立了革命的三结合临时权力机构。但是，在少数地区或单位，毛主席关于正确对待干部的最新指示还没有很好落实，认真贯彻。大家顺藤挖根，认为产生这种情况的根源，就是自己头脑里还不相信干部的大多数，怕干部站出来搞打击报复，怕自己被说成“右倾”，实际上是私字在作怪。宜春地区的同志说，能不能正确对待干部，是执行不执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟不紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的原则问题，是考验忠不忠于毛主席的试金石。他们表示，一定更好地贯彻毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，教育和团结好干部的大多数。赣州地区的同志，重温了毛主席“对于那些犯了错误但是还可以教育的、同那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们”的教导，深深认识到应该以真正无产阶级革命派的宽阔胸怀，努力挽救干部，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。他们在会上遵照毛主席提出的“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”这一识别干部的主要方法，对本地区尚未解放的领导干部进行了全面的、历史的分析，并且立即派人回专区，宣传和落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。
    如何进一步发展和巩固革命大联合，这是当前的一个重要问题。参加扩大会议的同志集中地学习了毛主席有关实现革命大联合的最新指示，并且对大联合的情况进行了总结和检查。目前，全省六个专区、一个市和百分之九十以上的县，都实现了按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合，形势空前大好，但是在局部地区和少数单位的革命派之间，还有“内战”，联合不起来，有的地方还存在如何正确对待犯过一些错误的老造反派的问题。革命大联合比较巩固的吉安、抚州等地区的同志说，要使两派消除分歧，实现革命的大联合，根本的一条就是要破私立公，按毛泽东思想办事。毛主席教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”我们一定要帮助两派坚决按照毛主席的这一教导办事。要用无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，促使两派在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合；已经联合的，要进一步巩固和发展革命大联合。
    参加会议的全体同志对毛主席最新指示越学越有劲，越学心里越亮堂。大家一边学习，一边行动，形成了迅速落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。抚州地区临时领导机构负责人会议期间赶回抚州，传达会议精神和收获，立即在全区掀起了大宣传、大学习、大落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。南昌地区的同志利用晚上休息时间回原单位传达学习的体会和学到的经验，促进本单位的同志学习和落实毛主席的最新指示。德兴县参加会议的两个革命群众组织负责人，通过学习毛主席的最新指示，各自做自我批评，消除了对立情绪，在会上签订了实现革命大联合的协议。在他们的带动下，上饶地区一些还没有实现革命大联合的群众组织的负责人，纷纷打电话回原单位，要求本组织与对方协商联合，有的还将两派有关负责人请到南昌来，商谈大联合的问题。
    在省革命委员会扩大会议的推动下，江西各地出现了大学习、大宣传、大贯彻毛主席最新指示的热潮。井冈山儿女决心把毛主席的最新指示化为自己的灵魂，变为自己的行动，争取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
