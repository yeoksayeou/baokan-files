Vice Chairman Chen Nanzhong Issues a Battle Call at the Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

Strengthen the People's War, Persist in a Prolonged Struggle, and Achieve Complete Victory

Determined to Strengthen the Construction of Liberation Armed Forces, Consolidate Base Areas and Liberated Zones, Display Initiative in Offensive Spirit, Improve Strategic and Tactical Levels, and Drown the U.S. Aggressors in the Ocean of People's War

Hanoi, January 27 (Xinhua) - According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, Chen Nanzhong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and Head of the Military Commission, called on the military and people of South Vietnam to consolidate their resolve for a protracted struggle, launch fierce, continuous, and widespread attacks on the enemy, and achieve even greater victories until final victory is secured.

Chen Nanzhong delivered a report at the meeting, analyzing the glorious military victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in 1967 and outlining the military tasks for 1968.

Chen Nanzhong said, U.S. imperialism, after suffering a major defeat in its transition from a "special war" strategy to a "limited war" strategy in South Vietnam, entered 1967. To expand its aggression in South Vietnam, the U.S. continued to send more troops to the South, increasing from 400,000 at the beginning of last year to nearly 500,000 by the end of the year. Weapons and war tools also increased significantly. In South Vietnam, the U.S. bandits are waging the largest war in the world in the past 20 years. The scale of this war is not only larger than the Korean War but in many aspects far exceeds the Korean War. The U.S. bandits have slaughtered and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of innocent people, destroying many of Vietnam's economic, cultural, educational, health, artistic, and religious facilities. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and brutal aggressor in human history.

Chen Nanzhong said, U.S. imperialism, unable to achieve its arrogant ambition of "breaking the backbone of the Viet Cong," that is, annihilating the main force of the people's liberation armed forces in 1965 and 1966, was forced to lower its strategic goals when it entered 1967. However, its plots remain very sinister. It proposed the "annihilation" and "pacification" "pincer strategy" plan. It tried to whitewash the puppet government, attempting to give it a legal facade. It also tried to build a large and powerful puppet army. At the same time, U.S. imperialism "gradually escalated" its destructive war against the North and repeatedly played the "peace talks" trick, attempting to force us to accept its surrender conditions and lay the foundation for further strengthening and expanding its aggression.

Chen Nanzhong said, however, under the blows of the people's war in Vietnam, the U.S. bandits and their lackeys suffered a comprehensive failure, suffering even more severe losses than in previous years. Their "pincer" plan was shattered. They failed to achieve their original strategic goals and instead suffered heavy losses. A large number of enemy forces were annihilated. The enemy lost 365,000 people, including more than 170,000 U.S. and mercenary troops, and a large number of war tools were destroyed: more than 3,000 aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and nearly 4,000 armored vehicles were destroyed. The more the U.S. imperialists whitewashed the Saigon puppet government, the more they exposed their ugly faces, and the puppet army was weaker than ever.

Chen Nanzhong said, the current situation of the U.S.-puppet clique is deteriorating day by day. It is clear that they are the defeated.

Chen Nanzhong emphasized that in the history of our nation's anti-American, national salvation struggle, 1967 was a year of unprecedented fierce fighting and unprecedented glorious victories for our military and people. Our achievements in 1967 were greater than in any previous year. This is a great victory for our military and people. Our liberated areas have been consolidated and expanded. This is another great victory for our military and people.

Chen Nanzhong said, in 1967, our military and people in many places set excellent examples of implementing the policy of combining armed struggle with political struggle. The Liberation Army made new progress in annihilation battles and continuous operations. In guerrilla warfare, all places also made new progress. In many places, the military and people fought well in cities. Recently, some places' military and people launched fierce attacks on the enemy in provincial capitals, controlling the capitals for many hours. On the water and land transportation front, the enemy also suffered continuous blows. The enemy's rear bases, warehouses, airports, and ports were also attacked, and the enemy suffered heavy losses in war potential, directly affecting their various "sweeping" operations.

Chen Nanzhong said, the facts have proven that the military and people of South Vietnam have tremendous potential, and when this potential is unleashed, it will become a force that can move mountains and fill seas. Our struggle policy and combat methods are highly correct and have a tremendous effect. They are heavy blows to the enemy's vital points.

He said, in the past year, the coordination among the three armed forces, the coordination among various aspects of a battlefield, and the coordination among various battlefields in the South have all developed. Therefore, we can launch continuous and fierce attacks and achieve many glorious victories. We have also better combined building the army with fighting, and thus we are becoming stronger and stronger.

Chen Nanzhong pointed out that the victories of the military and people of South Vietnam in 1967 and the enemy's failures have great significance in both military and political terms. These victories are a solid foundation for the military and people of the South to achieve even greater and more glorious victories in the future. These victories show that no matter how many more troops the U.S. imperialists send to the war of aggression, they will inevitably suffer a complete defeat. Our resistance will definitely achieve the final victory. As our nation's wise leader, Chairman Hu, pointed out: "The failure of the United States is obvious."

Chen Nanzhong said, our victories in 1967 are the victories of the iron will of the entire military and people of the South to decisively fight and defeat the U.S. bandits, the victories of the correct line of the National Liberation Front, the victories of the unity of the military and people, and the victories of the unity of the flesh-and-blood South and North.

Chen Nanzhong said, we are entering 1968 under unprecedented favorable conditions. The U.S. bandits and their lackeys are at a loss in military and political, tactical and strategic terms. They are in a serious passive situation on the battlefield. Their biggest difficulty is that the morale of the U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops is low.

Chen Nanzhong said, in contrast to the enemy, the military and political power of the military and people of South Vietnam is stronger than ever. Our advantages are increasingly consolidated, and our strength is enhanced. We have the full ability to achieve even greater victories in 1968 than in 1967.

He said, however, the U.S. bandits are still extremely stubborn and have many plots. They will continue to muster troops and weapons and send them to the battlefield. They will continue to strengthen and expand the war and take cunning and vicious military measures and cunning political and diplomatic tactics to create many difficulties and obstacles for our resistance. On the other hand, our military and people will inevitably encounter not a few difficulties in their forward march. But, as the saying goes, "gold is tested by fire, and heroes are tested by adversity." The heroic military and people of South Vietnam must forge ahead, determined to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies.

Chen Nanzhong said, to adapt to the new situation and tasks of the new year, the entire military and people of the South must strive to strengthen unity, strengthen all aspects of power, promote the cause of anti-American national salvation, and achieve even greater victories. The entire military and people of the South must strengthen their resolve and definitely achieve the program of the National Liberation Front and achieve the final victory.

We must annihilate more U.S. and mercenary troops and annihilate and disintegrate more puppet troops.

We must widely consume the enemy's strength, especially to launch annihilation battles, and annihilate more and more of the enemy's larger units. We must continuously improve the efficiency and speed of annihilating the enemy, launch more fierce attacks on the enemy, and achieve more victories in succession, making the enemy suffer even more severe losses.

We must resolutely smash the enemy's "pacification" plots and resolutely defend and expand the liberated areas.

We must thwart the enemy's large and small "sweeping" operations against our base areas and smash their plots of encroachment.

Our various armed forces must also resolutely strike the enemy in areas temporarily occupied by the enemy.

We must further thoroughly implement the policy of closely combining armed struggle with political struggle, strengthen the work of disintegrating the enemy army, and give full play to the comprehensive strength of the people's war. We must further improve the level of flexible use and coordination of various combat methods.

We must further strengthen the close coordination among the three armed forces and the coordination and cooperation among various places and battlefields, creating a situation where the enemy is attacked everywhere, making the enemy more passive and helpless, and unable to cope with the people's war.

Chen Nanzhong emphasized that our guiding ideology is to launch fierce, continuous, and widespread attacks.

We achieved great victories in the winter of 1967. In the next few months of spring, we must fight hard and achieve even greater victories. The summer and autumn of this year must be fought more fiercely than the summer and autumn of last year, achieving even greater victories. Every season, every year, we must achieve even greater victories until we achieve complete victory.

We must become stronger and stronger in battle, and our energy must be more abundant. Therefore, while fighting, we must strive to build our strength from all aspects. The most basic thing is to continuously carry out political and ideological education, so that our entire army and people thoroughly understand the situation and tasks, consolidate the resolve to fight as long as necessary, carry forward revolutionary heroism, mobilize everyone to make the greatest efforts, and be determined to forge ahead and achieve glorious victories.

We resolutely build the people's liberation armed forces, making them develop in both quantity and quality. We must vigorously build base areas and liberated zones to complete the task of striking invading enemies, become a strong rear for the resistance, and provide more manpower and material resources for the front line to defeat the U.S. aggressors and their traitorous lackeys.

Chen Nanzhong finally said, 1968 is a very important year for our resistance. We firmly believe that no matter how ferocious and brutal the enemy is, no matter how difficult and fierce the situation is, we have the correct line and policy of the National Liberation Front, the power of the entire people united as one, the heroic people's liberation armed forces, and the sincere help and support of friends from all over the world. Therefore, 1968 will definitely be a year in which our military and people achieve even greater and more glorious victories.

We will definitely win,
The U.S. bandits will definitely lose.

    陈南忠副主席在越南南方民族解放阵线主席团扩大会议上发出战斗号召
    加强人民战争坚持持久战夺取彻底胜利
    决心加强解放武装力量的建设，巩固根据地和解放区，发挥主动进攻精神，提高战略战术水平，把美国侵略者淹没在人民战争汪洋大海里
    新华社河内二十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团副主席、军事委员会主任陈南忠，在十五日到十七日召开的越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团扩大会议上，号召越南南方军民巩固持久作战的决心，猛烈、连续和广泛地进攻敌人，夺取更加巨大的胜利，直到取得彻底的胜利。
    陈南忠在会议上作了一项报告，分析了越南南方军民一九六七年在军事上取得的辉煌胜利，提出了一九六八年的军事任务。
    陈南忠说，美帝国主义是在它在越南南方推行“特种战争”战略转为
  “局部战争”战略遭到大败之后，进入一九六七年的。美国为了扩大对越南南方的侵略战争，继续向南方增派美军，从去年初的四十万名增加到年底的近五十万名。武器和战争工具也增加了许多。在越南南方，美国强盗正在进行二十多年来世界上最大的一场战争。这场战争的规模不仅比侵略朝鲜战争大，而且在许多方面远远地超过了朝鲜战争。美国强盗屠杀和监禁数以十万计的无辜人民，破坏了越南人民的许多经济、文化、教育、卫生、艺术和宗教设施。美帝国主义是人类历史上最凶恶、最残暴的侵略者。
    美帝国主义由于不能实现它在一九六五年和一九六六年提出的“打断越共的脊骨”，即消灭人民解放武装力量的主力的狂妄野心，所以进入一九六七年时，它被迫降低了各项战略目标。但是，它的阴谋仍然很险恶。它提出了“寻歼”和“绥靖”的“钳形战略”计划。它极力为伪政权涂脂抹粉，妄图给它披上一层合法的外衣。它还妄图建设一支人数众多的强大的伪军。与此同时，美帝国主义在对北方的破坏性战争中“逐步升级”，并接连不断地玩弄“和平谈判”的骗局，妄想迫使我们接受它提出的投降条件，为它今后进
  一步继续加强和扩大侵略战争奠下基础。
    陈南忠说，但是，在越南人民战争的打击下，美国强盗及其走狗又遭到了全面的失败，遭到了比往年更加惨重的失败。它的“钳形”计划被粉碎了。它实现不了原来的战略目标，反而遭到了很大的损失。美伪集团的大量有生力量被消灭。敌军有三十六万五千人被打死打伤，其中包括美军和帮凶军十七万多名，大批战争工具被摧毁：三千多架飞机被击落击毁，近四千辆装甲车被击毁。美帝国主义越是为西贡伪政权涂脂抹粉，就越是丑态百出，伪军也比任何时候都更加衰弱。
    陈南忠说，美伪集团目前的情况正在日益恶化。很明显，它们是战败者。
    陈南忠强调说，在我们民族的抗美救国历史中，一九六七年是我们军民战斗空前激烈和取得空前的辉煌胜利的一年。我们在一九六七年的战绩比以往任何一年都大。这是我们军民的巨大胜利。我们的解放区得到了巩固和扩大。这是我们军民的又一个巨大胜利。
    陈南忠说，在一九六七年，我们许多地方的军民树立了运用武装斗争和政治斗争方针的十分良好的典型。解放军在打歼灭战和连续作战方面有了新的进步。在游击作战方面，各地也都有了新的进步。许多地方军民在城市里杀敌，打得很好。最近，有些地方军民还向省会的敌军发动猛烈进攻，控制省会许多小时。在水陆交通战线上，敌人也接连遭到打击。敌人的后勤基地、仓库、机场和海港也遭到袭击，敌人在战争潜力方面遭到了重大损失，直接影响到了它们的各次“扫荡”。
    陈南忠说，事实证明，越南南方军民具有十分巨大的潜力，当这些潜力得到发挥的时候，就会形成移山填海的力量。我们的斗争方针和作战方式是十分正确的，具有十分巨大的效果。是对敌人要害的沉重的打击。
    他说，在过去一年里，三种武装力量之间的配合、一个战场中的各个方面之间的配合和全南方各个战场之间的配合，都有了新的发展。因此，我们可以连续和猛烈地进攻，夺取许多辉煌胜利。我们也更好地把建军和战斗结合起来，因此越战越强。
    陈南忠指出，越南南方军民在一九六七年的胜利和敌人的失败，在军事和政治上都具有十分重要的意义。这是南方军民在今后期间夺取更加巨大、更加辉煌的新胜利的牢固基础。这些胜利表明，不管美帝国主义在侵略战争中增加多少军队，也必定遭到彻底的失败。我们的抗战必定取得最后的胜利。正如我们民族的英明领袖胡主席所指出的：“美国的失败是明显的了”。
    陈南忠说，我们在一九六七年的胜利，是南方全民全军决战决胜美国强盗的钢铁意志的胜利，是民族解放阵线的正确路线的胜利，是军民团结的胜利，是骨肉的南北两方人民团结的胜利。
    陈南忠说，我们是在空前有利的条件下进入一九六八年的。美国强盗及其走狗在军事和政治上、战术和战略上正一筹莫展，不知所措。它们在战场上正处于严重被动的困境。它们的最大困难是，美军、伪军和帮凶军士气低落。
    陈南忠说，与敌人相反，越南南方军民的军事力量和政治力量比任何一年都强大。我们的优势日益巩固，我们的力量得到加强。我们完全具有足够的能力在一九六八年夺取比一九六七年更为巨大的胜利。
    他说，然而，美国强盗还极其顽固，还有许多阴谋。它还要竭力搜罗军队和武器，继续投到战场上去。它还要加强和扩大战争，还要采取奸诈恶毒的军事措施和狡猾的政治与外交手段，给我们的抗战造成许多困难与障碍。另一方面，我们军民在自己的前进道路上，不可避免地要遇到成长中的不小的困难。但是，烈火识真金，艰难见英雄。英雄的越南南方军民只有冲上前去，决心克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人。
    陈南忠说，为了适应新的一年的形势和任务，南方全民全军必须努力加强团结，加强各个方面的力量，促进抗美救国事业，进而夺取更为巨大的胜利。南方全民全军必须加强决心，一定要实现民族解放阵线的纲领，夺取最后胜利。
    我们必须歼灭更多的美军和帮凶军，歼灭和瓦解更多的伪军。
    必须广泛地消耗敌人的力量，特别是要打歼灭战，越来越多地歼灭敌人更大的单位。我们必须不断提高歼敌效率和速度，更猛烈地进攻敌人，连续夺取更多的胜利，使敌人遭到更严重的损失。
    我们坚决粉碎敌人的“绥靖”阴谋，坚决保卫和扩大解放区。
    我们要挫败敌人向我们根据地发动的一切大小“扫荡”，粉碎它的蚕食阴谋。
    我们的各种武装力量也要坚决在敌人暂时占领的地区打击敌人。
    我们要进一步彻底实现武装斗争和政治斗争紧密结合的方针，加强瓦解敌军工作，发挥人民战争的综合力量。要进一步提高灵活运用和配合各种作战方式的水平。
    要进一步加强三种武装力量之间的紧密配合和各地方、各战场之间的协调配合，造成到处进攻敌人的形势，使敌人更加被动、狼狈不堪，无法对付人民战争。
    陈南忠强调说，我们的指导思想，是猛烈、连续和广泛地进攻。
    我们在一九六七年冬季取得了巨大胜利。在今年春季的几个月里，我们要狠狠地打，夺取更大的胜利。今年的夏秋季要打得比去年的夏秋季更猛，夺取更大的胜利。每一个季节，每一年，我们都要夺取更加巨大的胜利，直到取得彻底的胜利。
    我们必须越战越强，精力越充沛。因此，我们在作战的同时，必须从各方面努力建设自己的力量。最基本的是，要不断地进行政治和思想教育，使我们全军和全民透彻认清形势和任务，巩固要打多久就打多久的战斗决心，发扬革命英雄主义，动员每一个人作出最大的努力，决心冲上前去，夺取辉煌的胜利。
    我们坚决建设人民解放武装力量，使它在数量上和质量上日益发展。大力建设根据地和解放区，以便完成打击来犯敌人的任务，成为抗战的坚强后方，为前线提供更多的人力物力，战胜美国侵略强盗及其卖国走狗。
    陈南忠最后说，一九六八年对我们的抗战是十分重要的一年。我们坚信，不管敌人多么凶恶和残暴，不管多么艰难困苦和激烈，但是，我们具有民族解放阵线的正确的路线和政策，具有全民团结一致的力量，具有英雄的人民解放武装力量，得到世界朋友们的诚挚的帮助和支持，所以一九六八年必将是我们军民取得更加巨大和辉煌胜利的一年。
      我们必胜，
    美国强盗必败。
