Under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary storm of the united struggle for power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat swept across the country in January 1967. A handful of capitalist roaders within the party in Sheng County, Zhejiang, unwilling to meet their doom, used the various powers they had usurped to block the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, making Sheng County impenetrable. The broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat were suppressed, and we were very anxious. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued the battle order to "support the broad masses of the left." We, the entire company, were overjoyed and determined to carry out Chairman Mao's great order without any compromise. Under the leadership of the Party branch, we, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, established the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

Our propaganda team consists of six people, none of whom had ever performed on stage before. We only had a huqin, a set of bamboo clappers, and a set of drums, but with a revolutionary spirit, we resolutely marched to the front line of class struggle and began our propaganda activities.

Our actions caused panic among a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They used various despicable means to sabotage and obstruct us. Once, when we went to a small town twenty miles away to propagate, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party found out and sent people to guard a small bridge, demanding our travel permits to stop us from propagating Mao Zedong Thought. We unfurled the red flag of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and declared firmly, "This is our travel permit! This is the travel permit given to us by Chairman Mao!" At this time, many revolutionary masses also rushed to support us. Under our propaganda team's and the broad revolutionary masses' stern refutation, those people had to slink away in defeat. This incident made us deeply realize that although we were only six people, we had the invincible spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought and the support of the broad revolutionary masses. We could break through all obstacles and spread Chairman Mao's great voice to the people!

More than thirty miles from our base is a mountainous area that is remote and controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, who desperately blocked the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. When we first went there to propagate, this handful of capitalist roaders deceived some of the masses and tried to attack us. Under the protection of revolutionary masses, their plot failed. Later, they spread lies to the masses, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames that had been ignited. After learning this, we decided to go there again for propaganda. At that time, revolutionary masses called to say, "Don't come. There are bad people waiting to ambush you on the road." Should we go or not? We thought: we are revolutionary soldiers of Chairman Mao. For the sake of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, if we dare not charge forward, we are not truly selfless people's soldiers. Thus, we sang the song of Chairman Mao's quotations, "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and with determined steps, we went there again for propaganda. Our action greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

The flames of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Sheng County burned more fiercely, and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party became more terrified. They desperately spread rumors, deceived the masses who did not know the truth, besieged the revolutionary factions, and even labeled a revolutionary mass organization as "counter-revolutionary," ordering its dissolution, attempting to strangle the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Sheng County. Class struggle became more intense. At this time, many revolutionary masses from sixty or seventy miles away came to us, earnestly requesting us to propagate. We had not finished propagating in one place when revolutionary mass organizations from a few other places sent people to sit by our side waiting for us to go there for propaganda. The eager expectations of the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat made us feel the weight of our responsibility even more. Therefore, we often braved wind and rain, crossed mountains and rivers, without time to eat, and set off with a few cold buns. Sometimes, we had to propagate in four or five places in one night and could only return at dawn. We had only one thought: wherever the struggle needed us, we would go there!

One day, more than sixty female workers from the Kaichuan Silk Factory walked more than fifty miles and rushed to our company at night, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in persecuting them. Their denunciations aroused our great indignation. We immediately set out, and on the way, we hurriedly rehearsed items like "Firing at the Capitalist Roaders' Reactionary Line." Upon arriving at the factory, without even having a sip of water, we immediately began propagating. With our hearts full of rage against the capitalist roaders' reactionary line, we exposed one by one the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The slogans on and off the stage surged higher and higher, forming a mass denunciation of the capitalist roaders' reactionary line, frightening a handful of capitalist roaders within the party so that they dared not show their heads. The broad revolutionary masses, however, were overjoyed and exultant. Many people were so moved that they shed tears of joy, saying, "You have brought us the voice of Chairman Mao and delivered powerful ideological weapons. With Chairman Mao guiding us and the People's Liberation Army supporting us, our rebellion is certain." Some of the deceived masses also quickly turned against the enemy and swiftly returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the more than nine months since our propaganda team was established, we have propagated more than 300 times, covering almost the entire Sheng County. Through extensive contact with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we have seen with our own eyes how much they love Chairman Mao and how loyal they are to Mao Zedong Thought. We have seen with our own eyes that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will turn into a powerful material force. This has further ignited our revolutionary passion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and strengthened our confidence and strength to overcome various difficulties. We are determined to fight for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in life and dedicate ourselves to the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in death, forever being propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席最新指示照亮了千村万户
    永远做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    南京部队空军某部十二连毛泽东思想宣传队
    一九六七年一月，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召下，无产阶级革命派联合夺权斗争的革命风暴，席卷全国。浙江嵊县党内一小撮走资派，不甘心于他们的灭亡，利用他们窃取的各种权力，封锁毛主席和党中央的声音，把嵊县搞得水泼不进，针插不入。广大的无产阶级革命派受到了压制，我们心里非常着急。在这个关键时刻，毛主席发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令。我们全连同志欢欣鼓舞，决心不折不扣地执行毛主席的伟大号令。在党支部的领导下，我们怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的心情，成立了毛泽东思想宣传队。
    我们这个宣传队，一共六个人，都没有登台演出过，只有一把胡琴，一副竹板，一套锣鼓，但是我们凭着一股革命激情，毅然走向阶级斗争的第一线，开展了宣传活动。
    我们的行动，引起了党内一小撮走资派的恐慌，他们采取了各种卑鄙的手段进行破坏和阻挠。有一次，我们到二十里以外的一个小镇去宣传，党内一小撮走资派知道后就指使人把守在小桥上，向我们要通行证，企图阻止我们宣传毛泽东思想。我们把毛泽东思想宣传队的红旗一展，斩钉截铁地说：“这就是我们的通行证！这就是毛主席发给我们的通行证！”这时，许多革命群众也闻讯赶来支持我们。在我们宣传队和广大革命群众义正词严的驳斥下，这伙人不得不灰溜溜地走了。这件事，使我们深深体会到，我们虽然只有六个人，但是我们有毛泽东思想这个威力无比的精神原子弹，有广大革命群众的支持，我们就能冲破种种阻挠，把毛主席的伟大声音传播到人民群众中去！
    距我们驻地三十多里的一个山区，地处偏僻，党内一小撮走资派控制这个地方，拚命封锁毛主席和党中央的声音。我们第一次去宣传时，这一小撮走资派蒙蔽一部分群众，企图围攻我们，在革命群众的保护下，他们的阴谋没有得逞。之后，他们又向群众进行欺骗宣传，企图把已经点起来的革命烈火扑灭下去。我们知道后，决定再去进行宣传。这时，革命群众打来电话说：“你们不要来了，有坏人要在路上围攻你们。”去不去呢？我们想：我们是毛主席的革命战士，为了宣传毛泽东思想，不敢冲不敢上，那就算不上一心为公的人民战士。于是，我们高唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录歌，怀着一颗对毛主席无限忠诚的红心，迈着坚定的步伐，再次去作了宣传。我们这一行动大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资派的威风。
    嵊县无产阶级文化大革命的烈火越烧越旺，党内一小撮走资派更加惊恐万状。他们拚命地造谣，欺骗不明真相的群众，围剿革命派，甚至把一个革命群众组织打成“反革命”，勒令解散，妄图扼杀嵊县的无产阶级文化大革命。阶级斗争越来越激烈了。这时，经常有许多革命群众从六、七十里以外赶来，恳切地要求我们进行宣传。我们在一个地方的宣传还没有完，另外几个地方的革命群众组织就派人坐在我们身边等着，叫我们去宣传。广大无产阶级革命派的殷切期待，更使我们感到自己责任的重大。因此，我们经常是顶风冒雨，翻山越岭，来不及吃饭，揣上几个冷馒头就出发了。有时，一个晚上要到四、五个地方去进行宣传，到天亮才能回来。我们只有一个想法，这就是：哪里斗争需要，我们就到哪里去！
    有一天，开源丝厂的六十多名女工，走了五十多里路，连夜赶到我们连队，向我们愤怒地控诉了党内一小撮走资派迫害她们的滔天罪行。她们的控诉，激起了我们的无比愤怒。我们就马上出发，边走边赶排了《向资产阶级反动路线开火》等节目。一到工厂，没顾得上喝一口水，就立即开始宣传。我们怀着对资产阶级反动路线的满腔怒火，一件件一桩桩地揭露一小撮走资派的罪行，台上台下口号声一浪高过一浪，形成了群众性的对资产阶级反动路线的愤怒声讨，吓得党内一小撮走资派不敢露头，而广大革命群众则欢欣鼓舞，扬眉吐气。许多人激动得流下了眼泪，高兴地说：“你们给我们带来了毛主席的声音，送来了强大的思想武器，有毛主席给我们指路，有解放军给我们撑腰，我们造反是造定了。”少数受蒙蔽的群众，也纷纷起来反戈一击，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    在我们宣传队成立的九个多月来，宣传了三百多场次，走遍了大半个嵊县。通过同广大无产阶级革命派的广泛接触，我们亲眼看到了他们是多么热爱毛主席，多么忠于毛泽东思想。我们亲眼看到了毛泽东思想一旦为广大群众所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量，这就更加激起了我们宣传毛泽东思想的革命激情，增强了我们克服各种困难的信心和力量。我们决心生为宣传毛泽东思想战斗，死为宣传毛泽东思想献身，永远做毛泽东思想的宣传员。
