As Mao Zedong Thought spreads more widely in Latin America and the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American people deepen, an increasing number of Latin American revolutionaries have come to recognize that the path of armed struggle indicated by Chairman Mao is the only correct path for the Latin American people to achieve a thorough victory in their national democratic revolution.

In recent years, revolutionary armed struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have repeatedly flared up in many countries of Central and South America. The Latin American revolutionary people have taken to the path of armed struggle as a result of the long-term military aggression, political oppression, and economic plunder inflicted on them by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The conclusion they draw is: "Use revolutionary violence to put an end to counter-revolutionary violence."

In their struggle, the Latin American revolutionary people resolutely reject the fallacies of "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road" peddled by the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist clique. The Soviet revisionist clique goes so far as to say that conditions exist in Latin America for development along the "non-capitalist road" and that the Latin American revolution can adopt "peaceful forms of struggle." It also directs certain revisionist parties to "cooperate" with the reactionary ruling cliques and engage in "legal struggle," thereby sabotaging armed struggle. This counter-revolutionary conspiracy has been resolutely opposed by the Latin American revolutionaries.

The broad masses of laboring people, who are deeply oppressed and exploited in the Latin American countries, place great hopes in armed struggle and have paid a high price for it. Now, many revolutionaries in Latin America have begun to use Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, to sum up the road taken by the Latin American revolution, especially to sum up the problems, experiences, and lessons of armed struggle in Latin America.

Many revolutionaries in Latin American countries have come to realize: To achieve victory in the Latin American revolution, one must follow the path taken by Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese people to seize political power through armed struggle. This path is: Under the leadership of the proletarian party, mobilize the peasant masses in the rural areas to wage guerrilla warfare, carry out a land revolution, establish rural base areas, encircle the cities from the rural areas, and finally seize the cities.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The leadership of the Communist Party is the only guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary war." The Latin American revolutionaries believe that armed struggle must be led by the vanguard of the proletariat, that is, a Marxist-Leninist party armed with Mao Zedong Thought. A revolutionary organization in Chile points out: "The armed people's war will be led firmly by the proletarian party." A leader of a revolutionary organization in Argentina said, "To achieve victory in armed struggle, it must be led by a new type of Marxist-Leninist party. This party should apply contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—according to the specific conditions of our countries."

In recent years, a large number of Latin American revolutionaries, in their sharp and fierce struggle against modern revisionism, have successively established Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in more than ten countries in Latin America. These parties and organizations are seriously studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and are actively preparing to launch armed struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "The victory of revolution always begins, develops, and wins first in places where the forces of counter-revolution are relatively weak." The Latin American revolutionaries have come to realize that in semi-feudal, semi-colonial Latin America, revolutionaries should focus on the weak links of the reactionary rule—the rural areas. A revolutionary organization in the Dominican Republic, in summing up the experience and lessons of the April 1965 anti-U.S. urban armed uprising, pointed out: The reason the uprising failed was because "the majority of the population, the peasants, did not participate" and "the revolution was carried out in the cities, which is precisely where the enemy can effectively mobilize its forces." A political resolution of the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of Colombia states: "The defeats suffered by the urban uprising in the Dominican Republic clearly prove a hundred times over that, under the current conditions on our continent, the countryside is the inevitable arena for people's war." "The people will develop their strength in battle, and this strength will be placed in the enemy's weak spots—the countryside." A revolutionary organization in Chile pointed out: "The people's war to seize power will be a long-term armed struggle, and its main stage will be the countryside."

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses." "The deepest source of the mighty power of war lies in the masses." The Latin American revolutionaries have come to realize that they must unite with the broad masses, especially the peasants.

A revolutionary organization in Brazil, in a political resolution, pointed out: "The peasant masses are a great force... they are an inexhaustible source of revolutionary vitality." The resolution emphasizes that to wage people's war in Brazil means "to organize the armed forces of the people, to extensively use guerrilla tactics, and to establish base areas in the countryside. This means recognizing that the landless peasants are the main body of the people's armed forces." A leader of a revolutionary organization in Peru, in summing up the experience and lessons of armed struggle in Peru, pointed out: "Weapons and geographical conditions are not the decisive factors in guerrilla warfare. Without the support of the peasants, guerrilla warfare cannot be victorious and cannot develop smoothly, which means that the people are the decisive factor. A purely military organization cannot lead the people's war, and it risks becoming bandits and ultimately being annihilated." A revolutionary from Ecuador said: In the past, we did not understand the importance of mass work, thinking that as long as we went up the mountain and fired a few shots, we would gain the sympathy of the peasants. Now I understand that we must do in-depth and detailed mass work to mobilize the peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must turn the backward countryside into an advanced and consolidated base area, into a great revolutionary stronghold in the military, political, economic, and cultural fields, to counter the vicious enemy who uses the cities to attack the rural areas and to gradually win complete victory in the revolution through prolonged struggle." The Latin American revolutionaries have gradually come to understand the importance of establishing revolutionary base areas through their own struggles. Some guerrilla fighters in a country in South America, after studying Chairman Mao's theory on establishing rural revolutionary base areas, said: "In the past, we only had guerrilla zones, but no rural revolutionary base areas, so when we went up the mountain, we had no rear base, and the rear base was in the big cities, and as soon as the enemy came, the connection was cut off." "The base area is our reliance; without it, we cannot seize power, and the enemy will destroy us." The Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of Colombia pointed out: "We must fight to establish revolutionary base areas. The revolutionary base area is the initial people's government, which will gradually expand through struggle until it finally wins over the alliance of the oppressing classes and imperialism."

Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Latin American revolutionaries will certainly follow the path of armed struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, push the anti-U.S., anti-dictatorship revolutionary armed struggle to a new stage, and, through prolonged and arduous struggle, ultimately achieve thorough victory.

### 毛泽东思想日益广泛传播　人民革命斗争不断深入发展  拉美人民决心走毛主席指引的武装斗争道路

    毛泽东思想日益广泛传播　人民革命斗争不断深入发展
    拉美人民决心走毛主席指引的武装斗争道路
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：随着毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲日益广泛的传播和拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的深入发展，越来越多的拉丁美洲革命者认识到，毛主席所指引的武装斗争的道路，是拉丁美洲人民取得民族民主革命彻底胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    近几年来，在中美洲和南美洲的许多国家里，不断燃起反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命武装斗争的火焰。拉丁美洲革命人民走上武装斗争的道路，是美帝国主义及其走狗长期以来对他们实行残酷的军事侵略、政治压迫和经济掠夺的结果。有压迫就有反抗，“用革命的暴力结束反革命的暴力”，这就是他们的结论。
    拉丁美洲革命人民在斗争中坚决摒弃了以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者兜售的“和平过渡”、“议会道路”的谬论。苏共叛徒集团胡说什么拉丁美洲存在着沿着“非资本主义道路”发展的条件，拉丁美洲革命可以采取“和平的斗争形式”。它还指使某些修正主义党同反动统治集团“合作”，进行“合法斗争”，破坏武装斗争。这种反革命阴谋遭到拉丁美洲革命者的坚决抵制。
    拉丁美洲国家深受压迫剥削的广大劳动人民，对武装斗争寄予巨大的希望，也为它付出了高昂的代价。现在，拉丁美洲的许多革命者开始运用毛泽东思想这一强大的思想武器来总结拉丁美洲革命所经历的道路，特别是总结拉丁美洲武装斗争中出现的问题、经验和教训。
    许多拉丁美洲国家的革命者认识到：要取得拉丁美洲革命的胜利，必须走毛主席领导中国人民武装夺取政权的道路，这条道路就是：在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村中发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出，领导中国革命战争的惟有共产党，“共产党的这种绝对的领导权，是使革命战争坚持到底的最主要的条件”。
    拉丁美洲革命者认为，武装斗争必须由无产阶级先锋队，即以毛泽东思想武装起来的马克思列宁主义政党来领导。智利一个革命组织指出：“武装的人民战争将由无产阶级政党进行坚定的领导。”阿根廷一个革命组织的领导人说，武装斗争要取得胜利，必须“要由一个新型的马克思列宁主义政党来领导，这个政党应该根据我们这些国家的具体条件运用当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。”
    近几年来，大批拉丁美洲的革命者在同现代修正主义的尖锐、激烈斗争中，相继在拉丁美洲十多个国家里建立起马克思列宁主义政党和组织。这些政党和组织正在认真学习和运用毛泽东思想，并且积极准备开展武装斗争。
    毛主席说：“革命的胜利总是从那些反革命势力比较薄弱的地方首先开始，首先发展，首先胜利”。拉丁美洲的革命者认识到，在半封建半殖民地的拉丁美洲，革命者应该把立足点放在反动统治的薄弱环节——农村。多米尼加一个革命组织在总结一九六五年四月反美城市武装起义的经验教训时指出：四月起义之所以没有成功，就是因为“占人口大多数的农民没有参加”以及“革命在城市进行，而这正是敌人能有效地调动其力量的地方”。哥伦比亚共产党（马列）的一项政治决议说：“多米尼加城市起义所遭受的打击百倍清楚地证明了，在我们大陆目前的条件下，农村是人民战争的必然场所。”“人民将在战斗中发展自己的力量，这力量将摆在敌人薄弱的地点——农村。”智利一个革命组织指出：“夺取政权的人民战争将是一场长期的武装斗争，它的基本舞台将是农村。”
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”拉丁美洲革命者认识到，必须和广大群众，特别是农民结合在一起。
    巴西一个革命组织在一项政治决议中指出：“农民群众是一支巨大的力量……他们是革命活力的一个无穷无尽的源泉。”决议强调要在巴西开展人民战争，这意味着“组织人民的武装力量，广泛地采用游击战术，在农村建立根据地。这意味着要认识到贫雇农是人民武装部队的主体。”秘鲁一个革命组织的领导人在总结秘鲁武装斗争的经验教训时指出：“武器和地理条件都不是游击战的决定因素，没有农民的支持，游击战就不可能胜利，也不可能顺利发展，这就是说，人民群众才是决定的因素，单纯的军事组织不能领导人民战争，而有成为流寇和最后被消灭的危险。”一位厄瓜多尔革命者说：以前我们不懂得群众工作的重要性，以为只要上山打几枪就能得到农民的同情。现在我懂得，必须作深入细致的群众工作来发动农民。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”拉丁美洲革命者从自己的斗争实践中逐步体会到建立革命根据地的重要性。南美洲某一国家的一些游击队员在学习了毛主席关于建立农村革命根据地的理论之后说：“过去我们只有游击区，而没有农村革命根据地，因此我们上山时没有后方，后方在大城市，敌人一来，联系就断了”，“根据地是我们的依靠，没有它，就不可能取得政权，敌人就会摧毁我们。”哥伦比亚共产党（马列）指出：“必须为建立革命根据地进行斗争，革命根据地是初期的人民政权，它将通过战斗的逐步发展而扩大，直到最后取得对压迫阶级和帝国主义联盟的胜利。”
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，拉丁美洲革命者必将沿着毛主席所指引的武装斗争的道路，把反美反独裁的革命武装斗争推向一个新的阶段，经过长期艰苦的斗争，最后取得彻底的胜利。
