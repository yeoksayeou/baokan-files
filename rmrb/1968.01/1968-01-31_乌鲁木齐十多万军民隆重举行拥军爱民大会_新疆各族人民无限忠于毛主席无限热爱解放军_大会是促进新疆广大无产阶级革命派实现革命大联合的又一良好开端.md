In the midst of the triumphant songs of implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao throughout the country, and under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," on January 28, more than 100,000 soldiers and civilians from the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the 7335 Unit stationed in Xinjiang, and revolutionary masses from the Urumqi area held a grand Spring Festival rally to support the army and love the people.

Representatives from the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit attending meetings in Beijing sent a congratulatory telegram to the rally.

This rally demonstrated that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who are on the front line of anti-revisionism, are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and infinitely love the great People's Liberation Army. They have an unshakable unity and a deep bond with the great People's Liberation Army. Currently, all military and civilian personnel in Xinjiang are striving to achieve revolutionary unity under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This rally is another good beginning for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Xinjiang to achieve revolutionary unity.

On January 28, after the snow in Urumqi, the sun shone brightly. More than 100,000 soldiers and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups gathered in the city center's People's Square, spirited, enthusiastic, and joyful. They held up giant portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of all ethnic groups, and carried red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly raising their arms and shouting, "Long live the unity of the military and the people! Long live the great People's Liberation Army! Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The rally began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." More than 100,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers of all ethnic groups jointly wished the red sun in the hearts of all Chinese and revolutionary people around the world, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Leaders from the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit, including Xing Yuanlin, Cao Danuo, Kong Ruiyun, and Li Quanchun, attended the rally. Xing Yuanlin, a leader from the Xinjiang Military Region, spoke on behalf of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang. He said, "We must further implement Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people' and strengthen the unity between the military and the people. This is an important guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He emphasized that Xinjiang is on the front line of the struggle against revisionism, and class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. Imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, along with a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party, and ghosts and monsters in society, hate and fear our unity between the military and the people. They spread rumors and slander, stir up trouble, and try every means to sabotage our national unity, our unity between the military and the people, and our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must maintain a high sense of class struggle, stay alert, strengthen our preparedness, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thoroughly smash the sabotage and disruption of all class enemies, both domestic and foreign. We must further strengthen the unity between the military and the people and national unity, forge an iron wall, defend the sacred borders of our great motherland, and ensure the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations in their speeches unanimously pointed out that the great People's Liberation Army is the main pillar of our proletarian dictatorship, the iron wall defending our socialist motherland, and the strong backbone of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the new year, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest and extremely important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, quickly achieve revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and unconditionally complete the five combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the PLA Daily. We will strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang!

The rally sent a telegram of respect to the red sun in our hearts, the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao.
