More than a thousand Australian postal van drivers go on strike

More than a thousand Australian postal van drivers, who went on strike to demand a wage increase, have been on strike for four days as of the 15th, causing all postal services in Australia to come to a halt.

Four days ago, the postal authorities dismissed an employee who participated in the struggle for a wage increase. All postal drivers in Sydney immediately went on strike in protest and demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed worker. Postal drivers in other areas also went on strike in support of their actions.

Under the strong pressure from the workers, the postal authorities were forced to reinstate the dismissed worker. However, the striking postal drivers decided to continue the strike until their demand for a wage increase is met.
