The Chinese Red Cross strongly condemns the savage acts of the U.S. and Thai reactionaries in persecuting Vietnamese overseas. The Thanom group must stop its criminal activities of persecuting Vietnamese overseas.

	BEIJING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Red Cross on Jan. 15 replied to a letter from Nguyen Dinh Thong, president of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Red Cross, firmly supporting the Vietnamese Red Cross' statement on the persecution of Vietnamese nationals by the Thai authorities. The Chinese Red Cross strongly condemns the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and the savage acts of the Thai reactionary authorities in persecuting Vietnamese nationals.

	The reply pointed out that the Thai authorities, in order to meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists in expanding the war in Vietnam, have colluded with the Saigon puppet regime to violate the agreement reached between the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Red Cross and the Thai Red Cross on Sept. 8, 1965, to temporarily suspend the repatriation of Vietnamese nationals. They are attempting to force Vietnamese nationals in Thailand to go to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder, which is another evil plot of U.S. imperialism to further expand the war in Vietnam. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The days of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are numbered. But all reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, will always make desperate struggles." The reply said that the Chinese Red Cross, as in the past, fully supports the statement made by the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Red Cross on Nov. 25, 1967, strongly condemning the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and the savage acts of the Thai reactionary authorities in persecuting Vietnamese nationals.

	The reply said that the Thai authorities must immediately stop all their criminal activities of persecuting Vietnamese nationals, immediately release all the arrested persons, respect the agreements signed by the Red Cross societies of the two countries, and effectively guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Vietnamese nationals and their normal travel and livelihood.

	The Chinese Red Cross received a letter from Nguyen Dinh Thong, president of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Red Cross, on Dec. 9, 1967, and the Vietnamese Red Cross' statement on Nov. 25, 1967, on the continuous persecution of Vietnamese nationals by the Thai authorities. In his letter, Nguyen Dinh Thong said that the Thai authorities, under the orders of the United States, have continuously carried out large-scale arrests, beatings, and killings of many Vietnamese nationals, attempting to force Vietnamese nationals to return to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialists. The Thai authorities have seriously trampled on the basic principles of international law regarding the right of foreigners to reside and have grossly violated the agreement signed between the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Red Cross and the Thai Red Cross on Aug. 14, 1959, and the minutes of the talks held on Sept. 8, 1965.

    我红十字会强烈谴责美泰反动派迫害越侨的野蛮行径
    他侬集团必须停止迫害越侨的罪恶活动
    据新华社十六日讯　中国红十字会十五日复信越南民主共和国红十字会会长武庭颂，坚决支持越南红十字会关于泰国当局迫害越南侨民的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋和泰国反动当局迫害越南侨民的野蛮行径。
    复信指出，泰国当局为了配合美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的需要，勾结西贡伪政权，破坏一九六五年九月八日越南民主共和国红十字会与泰国红十字会关于暂缓遣返越南侨民的协议，企图强迫旅泰越侨去南越充当炮灰，这是美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争的又一罪恶阴谋。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。但是，一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”复信表示，中国红十字会同过去一样，完全支持越南民主共和国红十字会一九六七年十一月二十五日的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋和泰国反动当局迫害越侨的野蛮行为。
    复信说，泰国当局必须立即停止迫害越南侨民的一切罪恶活动，立即释放所有被捕人员，尊重越泰两国红十字会所签订的协定，切实保障越侨的生命、财产安全与正常的来往和谋生的权利。
    我国红十字会曾在一九六七年十二月九日收到越南民主共和国红十字会会长武庭颂在同年十一月二十五日的来信，和越南红十字会一九六七年十一月二十五日关于泰国当局接连不断地迫害越南侨民的声明。武庭颂在信中谈到，泰国当局奉美国的意旨，接连不断地大规模逮捕、毒打、枪杀许多越南侨民，企图强迫越南侨民回到南越，为美帝充当炮灰。泰国当局严重地践踏了国际法关于外侨居留权的基本原则，粗暴地违犯了越南民主共和国红十字会与泰国红十字会签订的一九五九年八月十四日协定与一九六五年九月八日会谈记录。
