The Honorable Birth of the Henan Revolutionary United Front Committee

The establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee will further consolidate and develop the revolutionary united front and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the province, and promote the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 13th: Amidst the clarion call for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a piece of heartening news has come from Henan Province: The revolutionary mass organizations of Henan Erqi Commune, Kaifeng 824, and Henan Construction General Headquarters, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the line of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," have reached an agreement on a united front under revolutionary principles, forming the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee. This has made new contributions to further consolidating and developing the united front throughout the province. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On the afternoon of the 11th, representatives from Henan Erqi Commune, Kaifeng 824, and Henan Construction General Headquarters, along with a broad mass of revolutionary people and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, held a grand meeting to celebrate the honorable birth of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee. Responsible comrades from the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, the Henan Provincial Military Region Party Committee, the Zhengzhou Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, and the Zhengzhou Garrison Command, including Liu Jianxun, Chen Guichang, and Wang Hui, attended the meeting.

The celebration began with the majestic song "The East is Red." Amidst the warm applause of the entire audience, a telegram of congratulations to our dearest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, was read. The telegram stated that sailing the vast sea requires a helmsman, and making a revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought. The honorable birth of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee is another brilliant manifestation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the banks of the Yellow River! The telegram expressed the determination to launch a larger-scale movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to resolutely, unconditionally, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

A representative of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee spoke at the meeting, saying that under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the care of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Provincial Military Region Party Committee, the representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions, led by Henan Erqi Commune and Kaifeng 824, and Henan Construction General Headquarters, have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resonating across the central plains!

Liu Jianxun, a responsible comrade of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the First Political Commissar of the Henan Provincial Military Region, spoke on behalf of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Provincial Military Region Party Committee, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee. He said that the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee will surely promote the consolidation and development of the revolutionary united front and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the province, and push forward the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units. At present, in consolidating and developing the revolutionary united front, we must eliminate the interference of both rightist and ultra-"leftist" tendencies, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and guard against the sabotage by a handful of capitalist roaders and all class enemies.

Representatives from Henan Erqi Commune, Kaifeng 824, and Henan Construction General Headquarters also spoke at the meeting. They enthusiastically hailed the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They unanimously expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions comprehensively, to achieve new merits and new achievements in the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The honorable birth of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee is a fruitful result of the Henan proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses' resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It is a major achievement of taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key and vigorously establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes recently held by the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Provincial Military Region Party Committee, the representatives from Henan Erqi Commune, Kaifeng 824, and Henan Construction General Headquarters, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key and Mao Zedong's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as their weapons, thoroughly criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and firmly established proletarian party spirit; thoroughly criticized selfishness and firmly established public spirit, thus raising their proletarian consciousness. Through repeated discussions and thorough consultations among the three parties, under revolutionary principles, seeking common ground while reserving differences, they finally reached an agreement. Each party sent out seven representatives to form the Henan Provincial Revolutionary United Front Committee. (A picture is attached)
