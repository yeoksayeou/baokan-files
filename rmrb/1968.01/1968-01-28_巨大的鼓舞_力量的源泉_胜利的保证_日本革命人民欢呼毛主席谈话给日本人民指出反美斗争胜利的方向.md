The revolutionary people of Japan are jubilant that Chairman Mao's talk has pointed out the direction for the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism to achieve victory.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, our correspondent reports: Four years ago, the red sun in our hearts, the most beloved great teacher of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, issued a talk on the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against American imperialism. He pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." Chairman Mao said: "The anti-American patriotic united front of the Japanese people from all walks of life is continuously expanding. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism." The revolutionary people of Japan, filled with revolutionary fervor, enthusiastically acclaim: This is the direction for the patriotic struggle against American imperialism pointed out by the world's most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, for the Japanese people.

Chairman Mao's "Talk on Supporting the Japanese People's Patriotic and Just Struggle Against American Imperialism" is a great inspiration and boundless encouragement to the Japanese people fighting on the eastern front against American imperialism. On the occasion of celebrating the fourth anniversary of Chairman Mao's talk, the revolutionary people of Japan are jubilant and enthusiastically praise: "The talk by the great leader of world revolution, Chairman Mao, is like the sunshine that nurtures all things to grow, like a beacon on the road to liberation, giving the Japanese people's struggle against the enemy boundless courage, wisdom, confidence, and strength." The revolutionary people of Japan, with hearts full of boundless respect for Chairman Mao, say: "The development of Japan's domestic and international situation and the actual struggle of the Japanese people show that the talk issued by the great leader of world revolution, Chairman Mao, four years ago in support of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against American imperialism, completely conforms to the reality of the Japanese people's struggle and is an unshakable truth."

Over the past four years, the revolutionary people of Japan have always regarded Chairman Mao's talk as a banner of truth leading from victory to victory. More and more people have united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, making the wave of the struggle against American imperialism surge higher and higher. Especially after the revisionist group led by Kobayashi openly abandoned the banner of struggle against American imperialism and openly slid into the quagmire of capitulation to the United States, alliance with the Soviet Union, opposition to China, opposition to revolution, and opposition to the people, a broad anti-American patriotic united front with the Japanese revolutionary left as its core has rapidly formed and expanded. Recently, in more than thirty prefectures in Japan, the people have held massive demonstrations against the entry of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" into the port of Sasebo. This is a vivid example. In this anti-American patriotic demonstration, from Hokkaido to Kyushu, from large cities and coastal areas to mountain villages, workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, urban petty bourgeoisie, religious figures, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who have long suffered under American imperialism's oppression have all joined this magnificent struggle against American imperialism. From the beginning of the struggle, revolutionary left-wing organizations in various parts of Japan that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), have conducted organizational work in various aspects. Other progressive organizations, progressive individuals, and patriotic students have also bravely participated in the struggle. Through this magnificent struggle practice, they have more deeply felt that "American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation." The atrocities of the Sato government, which is a lackey of American imperialism and seeks personal gain at the expense of the nation, in sending out large numbers of police to brutally suppress the patriotic people have aroused great indignation. The new vicious attacks launched by the Kobayashi group against the broad anti-American patriotic youth students have, in addition to once again exposing its false anti-Americanism and true betrayal, loyally following American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and stubbornly adhering to the anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China line in collusion with the Sato reactionary government, also reflected its inner anxiety over the development and growth of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic united front.

Under the guidance of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese people are increasingly awakening. In their actual struggles, they have organically combined the expansion and development of the domestic anti-American patriotic united front with the expansion and development of the international anti-American united front.

In his "Talk on Supporting the Japanese People's Patriotic and Just Struggle Against American Imperialism," Chairman Mao pointed out: "The peoples of China and Japan should unite, the peoples of Asian countries should unite, all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations in the world should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite, and all countries and individuals suffering from American imperialism's aggression, control, interference, and bullying should unite to form a broad united front against American imperialism, frustrate the aggressive plans and war plans of American imperialism, and defend world peace." Over the past four years, the Japanese people have taken this teaching of Chairman Mao as their action guideline.

In their various struggles against American imperialism (such as the heroic struggle against American military bases, the heroic struggle against the entry of American nuclear submarines, and the struggle against American imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism), the Japanese people have always clearly put forward the slogans of opposing American imperialism's expansion of the Vietnam War and opposing American imperialism's turning its aggression towards China and Asia. In the recent struggle against the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" at the port of Sasebo, the Japanese people shouted: "Oppose American imperialism's expansion of the Vietnam War!" "Stand together with the Vietnamese people and fight together!" They severely condemned the new crimes of the Sato government in helping American imperialism expand the Vietnam War.

Under the inspiration of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese people, fearless of violence, have fought bravely and unyieldingly in their struggle against American imperialism. Chairman Mao pointed out in his talk: "The Japanese people will definitely be able to drive the American imperialists out of their own country, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will definitely be realized." The development of the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle will certainly prove the correctness of this wise judgment of our great leader, Chairman Mao.

    巨大的鼓舞　力量的源泉　胜利的保证
    日本革命人民欢呼毛主席谈话给日本人民指出反美斗争胜利的方向
    据新华社二十七日讯　本社记者报道：四年前，我们心中最红最红的红太阳、世界人民最敬爱的伟大导师毛主席就日本人民反对美帝国主义的爱国正义斗争发表谈话指出：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”毛主席说：“日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线不断地扩大。这是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”日本革命人民满怀革命激情热烈地欢呼：这是世界人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给日本人民指出了反美爱国斗争胜利的方向。
    毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》，对战斗在反对美帝国主义东方前哨的日本人民是极大的鼓舞，无限的激励。在欢庆毛主席发表谈话四周年时，日本革命人民欢欣鼓舞地热情称颂：“世界革命的伟大导师毛主席的谈话，象抚育万物生长的阳光，象解放道路上的指路明灯，给日本人民的对敌斗争以无限勇气、智慧、信心和力量。”日本革命人民满怀对毛主席无限崇敬的心情说：“日本的国内外形势的发展以及日本人民的实际斗争表明，世界革命的伟大领袖毛主席在四年前发表的支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话，完全符合日本人民的斗争实际，是颠扑不破的真理。”
    四年来，日本革命人民一直把毛主席的谈话，当做一面从胜利走向胜利的真理的旗帜。越来越多的群众，团结在光辉的毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，使反美斗争浪潮一浪高过一浪。特别是在宫本修正主义集团公开放弃反美旗帜，公开滑到降美、联苏、反华、反革命、反人民的泥潭中以后，一个以日本革命左派为核心的广泛的反美爱国统一战线迅速形成和扩大。最近，在日本三十多个都道府县中，人民群众举行声势浩大的反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”进驻佐世保港口的斗争，就是一个鲜明的例证。在这次反美爱国大示威中，从北海道到九州岛，从大城市、沿海地方到山村，一直遭受美帝国主义压迫的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、城市小资产者、宗教界人士、中小企业家等，都卷入了这场波澜壮阔的反美斗争。斗争一开始，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的日本各地革命左派组织以及日中友好协会（正统）组织，就多方面地进行了组织工作。其它进步团体、进步人士、爱国学生也都奋勇参加了斗争。他们从这一波澜壮阔的斗争实践中，更加深切地体会到“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人”。美帝国主义的走狗、卖国求荣的佐藤政府派出大批警察残酷镇压爱国人民的滔天罪行，激起了极大民愤。宫本集团对广大反美爱国青年学生发出的新的恶毒攻击，除了再一次说明它假反美真叛卖，忠实地追随美帝苏修，同佐藤反动政府同流合污，顽固坚持反共、反人民、反革命、反华路线之外，还反映了它对日本人民反美爱国统一战线日益发展壮大的内心焦虑。
    日本人民在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，日益觉醒。他们在实际斗争中，已经把扩大和发展国内的反美爱国统一战线同扩大和发展国际的反美统一战线有机地结合起来了。
    毛主席在《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》中指出：“中日两国人民要联合起来，亚洲各国人民要联合起来，全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族要联合起来，一切爱好和平国家要联合起来，一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人士要联合起来，结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线，挫败美国帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划，保卫世界和平。”四年来，日本人民正是把毛主席的这一教导作为自己的行动指南。
    日本人民在历次反美斗争中（如反对美国军事基地的英勇斗争，反对美国核潜艇进驻的英勇斗争，反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的斗争），都鲜明地提出了反对美帝扩大侵越战争、反对美帝把侵略矛头指向中国和侵略亚洲的口号。在最近这次反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”停泊佐世保港口的斗争中，日本人民高呼：“反对美帝扩大侵越战争！”“和越南人民团结起来共同斗争！”严厉谴责佐藤卖国政府帮助美帝扩大侵越战争的新罪行。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞下的日本人民，在反美斗争中，不畏强暴，前赴后继，英勇战斗的事例层出不穷。毛主席在谈话中指出：“日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”日本人民革命斗争的发展，必将证实我们伟大领袖毛主席的这个英明论断。
