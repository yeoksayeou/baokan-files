Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The people who have already won revolutionary victory should help the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

Our country's overseas aid personnel, following Chairman Mao's teachings, travel thousands of miles to help the people of various countries in their construction efforts. They are extremely responsible in their work and have an extreme enthusiasm for the people of various countries. They treat the construction of various countries as their own cause. They are not afraid of hardship and are not afraid of fatigue, always maintaining a frugal and simple style of work, sharing joys and sorrows with the laboring people of various countries. They regard the laboring people of the countries they are in as their class brothers, giving them great concern, and imparting technical knowledge without reservation. When necessary, they are even willing to sacrifice their lives for these class brothers. They wholeheartedly serve the people of all countries in the world and are truly internationalist warriors of the proletariat, truly good sons and daughters of the Chinese people.

In the long-term joint work and life, our overseas aid personnel have forged deep friendships with the local laboring people and have been warmly praised by the people of various countries. People of various countries unanimously praise them as "experts sent by Chairman Mao," enthusiastically saying: "From the Chinese experts, we see the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought."

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Our overseas aid personnel have achieved great success in their overseas aid work because they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively applied Chairman Mao's works. Our overseas aid personnel, with boundless loyalty and love for the great leader Chairman Mao, seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They take "The Three Articles" as their motto and repeatedly study them, always taking heroes like White and Zhang Zhide as examples, strictly demanding of themselves. They draw boundless wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works.

The proletarian internationalist spirit of our overseas aid personnel and their example of actively applying Mao Zedong Thought are worthy of our learning.

Everywhere the Green Hills Bury Loyal Bones
— In Memory of the Internationalist Warrior Zhang Mincai, Who Sacrificed Himself for the People of Tanzania

On the morning of October 4 last year, several Chinese water conservancy experts who were designing the Rufiji River Kidunda Dam project came to the grassy area in the lower reaches of the Rufiji River in eastern Tanzania to conduct the final survey work. Chinese hydrological engineer Zhang Mincai, in order to obtain the first-hand materials needed for the final work, personally participated in this survey. That day, they overcame various difficulties under the scorching sun and measured the cross-section of the river valley in a grassy area deeper than a person. Suddenly, a swarm of poisonous bees attacked, and there was no time to dodge. All the Chinese experts present were stung by the bees, and the rescuing comrades found Zhang Mincai unconscious in the deep grass after being severely stung by the poisonous bees.

In Dar es Salaam, doctors at Muhimbili Hospital began an emergency rescue in a ward. Doctors and staff from both China and Tanzania worked closely together, forgetting sleep and rest, and conducted a rescue operation for four days and four nights. However, Zhang Mincai eventually succumbed to severe poisoning and passed away on October 8, 1967, despite all efforts.

The people of Tanzania, with profound sorrow, buried the ashes of internationalist warrior Zhang Mincai, who sacrificed himself for helping Tanzania with economic construction and promoting friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples, in the Ilaala Cemetery in the African quarter of Dar es Salaam.

Respect the People, Love the People

Zhang Mincai always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people who have already won revolutionary victory should help the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Since 1964, he has been entrusted by the people of his motherland to go abroad three times to support the construction of Asian and African countries.

Communist Party member Zhang Mincai drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." He truly did what Chairman Mao said: "extremely responsible" to the construction of Tanzania and "extremely enthusiastic" towards the people of Tanzania.

Tanzania, located on the equator, is scorching hot. Zhang Mincai and other comrades trekked through the wilderness infested with wild beasts, investigating the irrigation area. His face was sunburned, and his feet blistered. He conducted more than ten days of field investigations continuously and successfully completed the task. Whether it was investigating water conditions with African farmers or imparting technical knowledge to African youth, he was always full of enthusiasm. Tanzanian friends who worked with him praised him for having "a heart that loves and respects the people" and called him "a good expert sent by Chairman Mao."

Follow Chairman Mao's Words

Zhang Mincai, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, seriously read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words. He never forgot to study Chairman Mao's works at any time and place. When there was no light during fieldwork at night, he used a flashlight to study. The English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" he left behind was almost completely studied from cover to cover. He took "The Three Articles" as his motto and repeatedly studied them. He took White and Zhang Zhide as examples, strictly demanding of himself, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and consciously transforming his subjective world. Zhang Mincai, under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, finally became an outstanding internationalist warrior of the proletariat.

Zhang Mincai often participated in physical labor and was enthusiastic about serving the collective. He cared more about others than himself. On October 4, after regaining consciousness from being stung all over his body, his first words were: "How are the comrades? Have they escaped?" As soon as he regained consciousness, he ignored his own pain and either asked the doctor guarding him to rest or discussed his suggestions for the next step of work with his group members. His strong will and selfless spirit moved the surrounding comrades to tears.

Forever in the Hearts of the Tanzanian People

After Zhang Mincai was seriously injured, he received deep concern from the Tanzanian government and people. During the rescue period, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and the hospital provided all possible medical equipment and medicines. Many Tanzanian doctors, nurses, and patients in the hospital closely followed his condition. When they learned that he was injured while helping Tanzania with its construction, they were deeply moved and did their best to rescue him.

Mosses, the Tanzanian representative for the Kidunda Dam project, heard the news of Zhang Mincai's death and immediately rushed from the construction site over 400 miles away to attend the funeral. He said in sorrow: "Zhang Mincai was martyred while helping our country with its construction. His death is not only a loss to the Chinese people but also a loss to us Tanzanian people. We will forever remember him."

In the funeral procession, there were many Tanzanian friends who did not know Zhang Mincai. They stood in front of his grave in deep sorrow and observed a moment of silence. Some even added a shovel of earth to his grave with their own hands.

Residents of the African quarter in Dar es Salaam said when talking about the Chinese expert Zhang Mincai, who sacrificed himself, that "the Chinese experts sent by Chairman Mao are the best friends of the African people." What particularly moved them was that the Chinese Embassy buried Zhang Mincai's ashes in an African public cemetery. They regarded this as a symbol of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples.

专栏：

        编者按　我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”
    我国援外人员遵循毛主席的教导，不远万里去帮助各国人民进行建设。他们对工作极端的负责任，对各国人民极端的热忱，把各国人民的建设事业当作自己的事业。他们不怕苦，不怕累，始终保持艰苦朴素的作风，同各国劳动人民同甘共苦。他们把所在国的劳动人民看作自己的阶级兄弟，给以巨大的关怀，毫无保留地传授技术知识，在必要时甚至不惜为这些阶级兄弟献出自己的生命。他们全心全意为世界各国人民服务，不愧是无产阶级国际主义战士，不愧是中国人民的好儿女。
    在长期的共同劳动和生活中，我国援外人员同当地劳动人民结下了深厚的友谊，受到各国人民热烈赞扬。各国人民异口同声称颂他们是“毛主席派来的好专家”，热情地说：“从中国专家身上看到了毛泽东思想的光辉”。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    我国援外人员在援外工作中取得巨大的成绩，是由于他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的结果。我国援外人员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚和热爱，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们把“老三篇”作为座右铭反复学，时时处处以白求恩、张思德等英雄人物为榜样，严格要求自己。他们从毛主席著作中汲取了无穷的智慧和力量。
    我国援外人员的无产阶级国际主义精神，他们活学活用毛泽东思想的范例，值得我们学习。
    青山处处埋忠骨
    ——悼念为坦桑尼亚人民献身的国际主义战士张敏才烈士
    去年十月四日上午，设计鲁伏河克洞达水库工程的几位中国水利专家来到坦桑尼亚东部鲁伏河下游河谷草丛地带，进行最后一项测量工作。中国水文工程师张敏才，为了取得最后一项工作所需要的第一手材料，亲自参加了这项测量工作。这天，他们在烈日下克服了种种困难，在一人多深的茂密草丛中测量河谷横剖面。突然，大群毒蜂扑来，势头凶猛不及躲避。在场的中国专家全被蜂螫，营救的同志赶来时发现张敏才同志被毒蜂严重螫伤昏厥在深草丛中。
    在达累斯萨拉姆，穆罕比利医院的一间病房里，医生们开始了紧张的急救。中坦两国医生和工作人员密切配合，废寝忘食，连续进行了四天四夜的抢救。但张敏才同志终因中毒过重，医治无效，不幸于一九六七年十月八日逝世。
    坦桑尼亚人民怀着无比沉痛的心情，把为帮助坦桑尼亚进行经济建设、增进中坦人民友谊而牺牲的国际主义战士张敏才烈士的骨灰，安葬在达累斯萨拉姆市非洲人区依拉拉公墓。
    尊敬人民，热爱人民
    张敏才同志牢记毛主席的教导：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”一九六四年以来，他接受祖国人民的委托，三次出国支援亚非国家的建设事业。
    共产党员张敏才从毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等光辉著作中吸取了无穷的力量。他对坦桑尼亚的建设事业真正做到毛主席所说的“极端的负责任”，对坦桑尼亚人民“极端的热忱”。
    地处赤道的坦桑尼亚骄阳似火。张敏才和其他同志一道跋涉在野兽出没的荒野长途，调查灌区情况。他的脸晒曝了皮，脚打起了泡。他连续进行了十多天野外调查，终于出色地完成了任务。不论是向非洲老农调查水情，或向非洲青年传授技术知识，他都是满腔热情。同他一道工作过的坦桑尼亚朋友赞扬他“有一颗热爱人民、尊敬人民的心”，称他是“毛主席派来的好专家”。
    听毛主席的话
    张敏才同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。他随时随地不忘学习毛主席著作，在野外工作晚上没有灯，他便用手电筒照着学。他遗留下的一本英文版《毛主席语录》只差几页便从头到尾仔细学完一遍。他把“老三篇”当作座右铭反复学。他以白求恩、张思德同志为榜样，严格要求自己，破私立公，自觉改造主观世界。张敏才同志在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，终于成为一个优秀的无产阶级的国际主义战士。
    张敏才同志经常参加体力劳动，热心为集体服务。他关心别人比关心自己为重。十月四日那天，他在满身被蜂螫昏迷醒后，第一句话便问：“同志们怎样？脱险没有？”他神志稍一清醒，不顾自己的伤痛，不是要求守护他的医生去休息，就是向本组同志谈他对下一步工作的建议。他这种坚强的意志和忘我的精神使周围的同志感动得热泪盈眶。
    永远活在坦桑尼亚人民心中
    张敏才同志身负重伤后受到坦桑尼亚政府和人民深切的关怀。在抢救期间，坦桑尼亚政府卫生部和医院提供了一切可能提供的医疗设备和药物。医院的许多坦桑尼亚医生、护士和病人都密切关注他的病情。当他们知道他是为坦桑尼亚的建设而负伤时深受感动，竭尽全力来进行抢救。
    克洞达水库工程坦方代表莫萨斯获悉张敏才同志逝世消息，立即从四百多里外的工地赶来送葬。他悲痛地说：“张敏才同志是在帮助我国建设时牺牲的，他的死不仅是中国人民的损失，也是我们坦桑尼亚人民的损失。我们要永远纪念他。”
    在送葬行列中有许多素不相识的坦桑尼亚朋友。他们怀着沉痛心情在张敏才同志墓前默哀。有的还亲手在墓上添一铲土。
    达累斯萨拉姆市非洲人居住区的居民在谈到中国专家张敏才烈士时说，毛主席派来的中国专家是“非洲人民最好的朋友”。特别使他们感动的是中国大使馆把张敏才烈士的骨灰葬在非洲人的公墓。他们把这件事看成是中坦两国人民深厚友谊的象征。　新华社记者
