The Yuhang County of Zhejiang Province has a small, elite propaganda team from the 7350th Unit of the People's Liberation Army. The team members, together with the revolutionary cadres of the commune, who are mainly poor and lower-middle peasants, have been vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. They have conducted in-depth, meticulous, and arduous political and ideological work. They have mobilized the broad masses of commune members to engage in a revolutionary critique. They have closely linked the criticism of the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, who advocates "three freedoms and one contract" to restore capitalism, with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own unit. At the same time, they have focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving double victories in both revolution and production.

The articles published in this issue are written by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the 7350th Unit and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Yuhang Commune.

    浙江省余杭县九堡公社有一支由七三五○部队派出的精干的毛泽东思想宣传队。宣传队的同志们和公社以贫下中农为主体的无产阶级革命派一道，大力宣传毛泽东思想，进行深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，发动广大社员群众，投入了革命的大批判。他们把批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”等复辟资本主义的反革命罪行，同本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来；同时，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    本版刊登的，就是七三五○部队毛泽东思想宣传队和九堡公社贫下中农写的批判文章。
