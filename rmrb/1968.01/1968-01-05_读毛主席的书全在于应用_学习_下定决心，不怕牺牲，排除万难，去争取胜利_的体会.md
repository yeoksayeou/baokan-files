Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding the revolutionary people to achieve complete liberation. Chairman Mao's works are the most powerful ideological weapons for transforming the world and the souls of people. Above all else, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the most important; among all principles, the first is to read Chairman Mao's books.

Reading Chairman Mao's books requires not just reading and thinking, but also applying what you learn, seeing immediate results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application."

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, instructs: "To study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to focus on the 'application' part."

In the past few years, Daqing has achieved great victories in its struggles against nature, against the land, and against class enemies. This victory is the result of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the result of the broad masses of Daqing's peasants actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the 'application' part.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing, most of whom begged for food and worked as laborers in the old society, have low cultural levels and have not read many of Chairman Mao's books. However, because we love Chairman Mao deeply, we have a profound class sentiment for the books written by Chairman Mao. We learn a sentence and apply it, and applying it produces tremendous effects. Now, let me talk about our reflections on learning Chairman Mao's teaching of "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory."

Learning "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" means resolutely fighting against nature, against the land, and against class enemies.

After Chairman Mao personally raised the red banner of Daqing, Daqing became famous worldwide. However, in the old society, if you walked thirty li out of Daqing, few people knew that there was a place called Daqing in Xiyang County. At that time, Daqing was a poor mountain valley. The natural conditions were: "The mountains are high and the rocks are many, stepping out the door means climbing a slope, the land has no three feet of flat ground, and there are disasters every year." We studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," so we resolutely set out to do it, fearlessly sacrificing ourselves to do it. We poor and lower-middle peasants had many people, but few draft animals and farming tools. After the land reform, we resolutely took the path of "organizing together." When the primary cooperative was just established, we didn't even have a wheelbarrow, relying only on two hands, two shoulders, and a carrying pole. There were seven hundred mu of land with forty-seven hundred plots, scattered across seven gullies and eight ridges on a slope. We resolutely decided to level the high and fill the low; the fields had many rocks, so we resolutely decided to move them; there were nine years of drought, so we resolutely decided to deeply plow and frequently hoe, turning hard soil into sponge fields. In this way, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we fully utilized the superiority of the socialist collective economy, mobilized people's enthusiasm, turned small plots into large plots, turned sloping fields into terraced fields, and turned dry riverbeds into irrigated fields. In 1967, Daqing's grain yield per mu reached over nine hundred jin, an increase of over seven times compared to the pre-liberation yield of about one hundred jin per mu; eighty households sold twenty-four ten-thousand jin of grain to the state each year, averaging three thousand jin per household.

If we had only studied Chairman Mao's works and stopped at the level of words; shouting "firmly resolve" with our mouths but not firmly resolving in our thoughts and actions, would that work? Definitely not. Without firm resolve, the difficulties in front of us would be great and numerous. We would be at a standstill! In 1946, when the Party called for organizing mutual aid teams, the rich middle peasants had strong labor and strong horses and did not cooperate with us. The nine poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely organized the first mutual aid team in Daqing. Among the nine, except for me and another poor peasant who were strong laborers, the rest were either old or young. The villagers called us the "old and young team" and called the mutual aid team of ten rich middle peasants the "strong team." At that time, there were many people who spoke ill of the "old and young team"! The "strong team" boasted that they would defeat the "old and young team." However, we were convinced that the path of "organizing together" pointed out by Chairman Mao was the correct path, so we resolutely decided, fearlessly sacrificing personal interests, to firmly establish the mutual aid team. That "strong team" was all show and no substance! On the surface, they cooperated, but in reality, they schemed against each other and did their own thing. That autumn, our "old and young team" had a grain yield of one hundred ninety jin per mu, while the "strong team" had only one hundred sixty jin per mu. We firmly resolved and achieved victory, while they lost miserably.

Farming is not magic. To produce more grain, one must work hard and do real work. Activities like plowing in winter, building dikes, filling gullies, and digging canals are hard and tiring. The ice is three feet thick, the cold is biting, and the pickaxe shakes your hands and arms. Facing this situation, do you apply Chairman Mao's teachings or not? It depends on whether you can firmly resolve and have the spirit of self-sacrifice and overcoming all difficulties. If you do, the mountains will bow their heads, and the ice rivers will yield. If you don't, opening your eyes, you see difficulties; closing your eyes, you think of difficulties, and you will be frightened into submission. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing have resolutely worked on these seventeen characters: "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory"; the more winter it is, the more we should vigorously engage in agricultural infrastructure construction. We have seen: first, winter labor is concentrated; second, there are few crops in the fields. These are excellent conditions for agricultural infrastructure construction. "Turn winter idleness into winter busyness, and produce more grain next autumn." We think this way and act this way. The rocks are hard, and the winter soil is hard, but they are not as hard as Mao Zedong Thought, not as hard as people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The "Iron Girls Brigade" of Daqing, with more than twenty young women, from spring to winter, under the stars and moonlight, they take on the heaviest work, always ask for less pay, and for several years, they have not complained or felt tired. Are they really made of iron? No, they are also born of parents, made of flesh and blood. It is just that they have studied Chairman Mao's works, studied and applied them, and their thoughts have changed, tempered to be harder than iron and firmer than steel!

Transforming nature requires firm resolve, and fighting against class enemies requires even more firm resolve. After learning Chairman Mao's teachings, the greater our resolve, the greater our enthusiasm, and the greater our achievements in collective ownership and transforming nature. This enraged a small handful of bad elements. The more we resolutely fight against nature, the more they fear, the more they see Daqing as a thorn in their eye and a splinter in their flesh, and the more they eagerly sabotage and oppose us. In this situation, what should we do? The best way is still to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, still to firmly resolve to fight against class enemies to the end.

In 1963, Daqing suffered a major flood disaster. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we firmly resolved, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and overcame the disaster, still achieving a good harvest and ensuring three things: the grain produced was not less; the grain for consumption was not less; the grain sold to the state was not less. This frightened the enemy. Under the plot of Liu Shaoqi and his agent in Shanxi, in 1964, a work team was sent with the experience of the capitalist roader Wang XX, under the guise of carrying out the "Four Clean-ups," deliberately aiming to destroy Daqing. They slandered that Daqing's high grain yield was fake; selling surplus grain was showing off; they slandered that Daqing's cadres were black cadres, fake models... At that time, we did not know that they were following Liu Shaoqi's "imperial decree," but we sensed that this "work team" had a big background and ill intentions. They were not here to do socialism but to dismantle the socialist collective economy. We saw through them and resolutely decided to fight them inch by inch. We would rather be labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" than let them blacken the red banner of Daqing personally raised by Chairman Mao. They measured the land and opened the granaries to inspect the grain but found no "evidence," so they labeled us with the crime of arrogance and self-satisfaction. We said: arrogance and self-satisfaction are connected with stagnation and not believing in the masses. We in Daqing actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, rely on the collective economy, and give full play to the role of people, with production increasing year by year, selling more to the state and keeping less for ourselves, how can this be called arrogance and self-satisfaction? They also maliciously said that our management system did not conform to the socialist principle of "distribution according to work" and was not voluntary for the members. We said: our management system in Daqing is good precisely because it emphasizes politics and does not follow the lead of work points. This is what the members demand. We firmly resolved to fight against wrong and reactionary words and deeds, fighting seven or eight times. After Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Twenty-Three Articles" were conveyed, this ill-intentioned "Four Clean-ups work team" was finally driven away in disgrace, and we again achieved victory.

Firm resolve requires a clear direction and a correct target. One cannot casually make a firm resolve or make a wrong resolve. Just as Chairman Mao teaches us: "...correct deployment comes from a correct resolve." Fighting against imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionary forces of all countries, fighting against domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the Party, and fighting against natural disasters, this direction is correct, firmly resolving to fight is good, the greater the resolve, the greater the victory. There is another situation where some revolutionary mass organizations have differences and conflicts, and one cannot firmly resolve to attack each other. Solving such differences and conflicts also requires actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" part, but using Mao's formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to solve them. If one insists on raising fists, shouting the slogan of "firmly resolve, fearlessly sacrifice" to cruelly fight and mercilessly strike one's own class brothers, this firm resolve is wrong. The greater the resolve, the greater the mistake.

Chairman Mao clearly tells us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution." Chairman Mao also says: "If you treat comrades as enemies, you are standing on the enemy's side."

Chairman Mao recently also instructs us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, within the working class, there is no reason to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. Learning Chairman Mao's teachings, we must resolutely follow them.

Every article and every word of Chairman Mao are targeted. Some are directed at the enemy and cannot be used on ourselves; some are directed at ourselves and cannot be used on the enemy. "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" is the most powerful weapon to deal with all kinds of enemies and overcome various difficulties. Aiding Vietnam and fighting against American imperialist aggression, suppressing the sabotage and destruction of domestic class enemies, fighting against and exposing the capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the Party, is to fight according to Chairman Mao's teachings. In such revolutionary struggles, sacrificing oneself is for the people's interests, dying is dying for a just cause, dying heavier than Mount Tai. If within the revolutionary masses, because of differing views, one side wants to suppress the other side, also "firmly resolve, fearlessly sacrifice" to fight, that is wrong, such a sacrifice is not worth it.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, but a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are still unwilling to admit their defeat. They are secretly looking for opportunities to create chaos. If we revolutionary mass organizations engage in factionalism, create friction, and fight "internal wars," we give them opportunities to exploit. This objectively boosts the morale of the bourgeoisie and dampens the spirit of the proletariat.

Here, there is also a question of firm resolve, which is to firmly resolve to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, firmly resolve to correctly handle internal contradictions among the people, firmly resolve to heighten vigilance, and not fall for the tricks of class enemies.

Chairman Mao's books are written for the proletariat, for the laboring people, and are the most powerful ideological weapons of the proletariat. Every word of Chairman Mao embodies the fundamental interests of the laboring people and is for the public good. Actively studying and applying the teaching of "Firmly resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" involves the question of whether it is for the public or for private interests. For the public is correct, for private interests is wrong; one cannot reverse or confuse them. Studying Chairman Mao's teaching, like studying other teachings of Chairman Mao, if it is for the public, it can be applied, applied well, and achieve results; if it is for private interests, it cannot be applied and cannot achieve good results.

In 1963, when Daqing Brigade suffered a major disaster, the brigade's granary was about to collapse, and the brigade leadership called on everyone to rescue the grain. The member Jia Chengxian was at home rescuing his own grain, already filling his sack with grain from the jar. He heard the broadcast and firmly resolved to sacrifice personal interests and not let the collective interests suffer losses. He poured the filled grain back into the jar, took the sack, and rushed to the granary to rescue the brigade's grain. At that time, a rich middle peasant member also made a resolve: wholeheartedly guard his own house, rescue his own grain, fearing the loss of even a single grain. He also mocked Jia Chengxian as a "fool," saying, "You rescued the collective's grain, how much can you get?" When Jia Chengxian returned home, the house had collapsed, and the grain and clothes were all buried; the rich middle peasant who mocked Jia Chengxian as a "fool" for being public-spirited also had nothing left of his house. For these two different resolves, the members had two different reactions: for Jia Chengxian, they unanimously praised him as a good member educated by Chairman Mao; for that rich middle peasant, the members criticized him for being in a socialist society but still having a capitalist mindset.

This means that firm resolve must be with "public" first, resolving for the public. That kind of resolve for private interests is incompatible with Chairman Mao's teaching of firm resolve.

Whether to apply or not is the touchstone of true learning and false learning, and it is also an attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." These few words are easy to say but not so easy to do. Everyone reads and recites Chairman Mao's books. Who truly learns and who learns best? The only standard is to see if one applies what one learns.

No matter how much one reads or how well one recites, if one applies little or not at all, it proves that one is not truly learning. On the contrary, learning one sentence and applying it, combining learning with application, seeing immediate results, that is true learning and learning with skill. Chairman Mao says: "If you can use Marxist-Leninist views to explain one or two practical problems, you will be praised and have achieved some success." This exactly expresses our thoughts. Reading Chairman Mao's books is to use them to explain and solve problems.

Chairman Mao's works are a treasure trove of wisdom. Learning and applying, focusing on the "application" part, can make people the wisest, stand the highest, see the farthest, and have clear minds and bright eyes.

Whether to apply what one learns from Chairman Mao's works is also an attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. We love the great leader Chairman Mao and must follow closely; following closely means reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words; listening to Chairman Mao's words means doing what Chairman Mao says, doing what Chairman Mao does, following closely in all matters and obeying every word. Reading Chairman Mao's books but not acting according to Chairman Mao's words, doing something else, is not truly following and is not truly loving.

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, says: Regarding Chairman Mao's works, "now it is not a question of whether to learn or not, but a question of whether one has truly learned or not, whether one truly knows how to apply or not." Vice Chairman Lin calls on us: "To further intensify the study of Chairman Mao's works, definitely link it with reality, and focus on the 'application' part." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing, over the past few years, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the midst of great storms, focusing on the "application" part, and have achieved results in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. However, compared to Vice Chairman Lin's requirements, we still have a long way to go. In the future, we will definitely continue to learn from the PLA, like the good soldier of Chairman Mao and the "Leftist and People-Loving Model" Comrade Li Wentong, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focus on the "application" part, live to struggle for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and die to dedicate oneself to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We firmly resolve to build a forever red Daqing, high above the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the tradition of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works be passed down from generation to generation!

    读毛主席的书全在于应用
    ——学习“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的体会
    陈永贵
    毛主席是我们革命人民心中最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是指引革命人民争取彻底翻身解放的灯塔。毛主席著作是改造世界、改造人的灵魂最强大的思想武器。千重要，万重要，忠于毛主席最重要；一千条，一万条，读毛主席的书第一条。
    读毛主席的书，要读，要思考，有些重要警句还要背出来。但是，最重要的是学了要用，要立竿见影。
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席指示说：“活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。
    我们大寨这几年在同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗，都取得很大胜利。这个胜利，是伟大的领袖毛主席英明领导的结果，是大寨广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的结果。
    大寨的贫下中农，大多数在旧社会都讨过饭、扛过活，文化水平都很低，对毛主席的书，读的也不算多。但是，由于我们无限热爱毛主席，对毛主席他老人家写的书有最深厚的阶级感情，学一句，就用一句，用一句就产生巨大的效果。现在，谈谈我们学习毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这一教导的体会。
    学了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，就下定决心去同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手树起大寨这面红旗后，大寨在世界上出了名。可是，在旧社会，走出大寨三十里，很少有人知道昔阳县还有个大寨。那时的大寨是个穷山沟。自然条件是：“山高石头多，出门就爬坡，地无三尺平，年年灾情多。”我们学习了《愚公移山》，牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，就下定决心去干，不怕牺牲地去干。我们贫下中农人口多，但牲畜、农具又最少。土地改革后，我们就下定决心走“组织起来”的道路。刚成立初级社时，连一辆独轮车也没有，就凭两只手、两个肩膀和一条扁担。七百多亩地有四千七百多块，还摆在七沟八梁一面坡上，我们就下定决心削高填洼；地里石头多，就下定决心要它搬家；十年九旱，就下定决心深翻勤刨，让硬土板变成海绵田。就是这样按照毛主席的教导，充分发挥社会主义集体经济的优越性，发挥人的作用，小块地造成大块地，坡地变成水平梯田，干河沟变成水浇田。一九六七年大寨粮食亩产达到九百多斤，比解放前的亩产一百来斤增长了七倍多；八十户人家，每年向国家缴售粮食二十四万斤，平均每户卖给国家粮食三千斤。
    如果我们学习了毛主席著作，光停止在口头上；嘴上喊着“下定决心”，思想和行动上又不去下定决心，行不行呢？那肯定不行。不下定决心，摆在我们面前的困难就是大，就是多。那才寸步难行哩！一九四六年，党号召组织互助组时，富裕中农人强马壮，不和我们互助。我们九户贫下中农就硬是下定决心组织起来，成立了大寨第一个互助组。九户当中，除了我和另一个贫农是壮劳力外，其余的人非老即小。村里人管我们叫“老少组”，把后来十户富裕中农组织的互助组叫做“好汉组”。当时对“老少组”说风凉话的人可多啦！“好汉组”扬言要把“老少组”赛垮。但是，我们认定毛主席指引的“组织起来”的道路是最正确的路，就下定决心，不怕牺牲个人的利益，坚决把互助组办好。那个“好汉组”才是外强中干哩！表面上互助，实际上勾心斗角，各干各的。当年秋后，我们“老少组”粮食亩产一百九十斤，而“好汉组”亩产只有一百六十斤。我们下定决心，争取到了胜利，他们却输得垂头丧气。
    种地不是变戏法。要想多打粮食，就要多下功夫，实打实干。象冬天翻地、垒堰、填沟、挖渠的活，就是苦，就是累。冰冻三尺，天寒地硬，镐头下去，震得手麻臂痛。面对这种情况，你学了毛主席的教导用不用？就看能不能下定决心？有没有自我牺牲和排除万难的精神？有，高山就低头，冰河就让路。如果没有，睁开眼就是困难，闭着眼想一想也是困难，会被困难吓得趴下来。我们大寨的贫下中农硬是在“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这十七个字上下功夫；越是冬季，越要大搞农田基本建设。我们看准了：第一，冬季劳力集中；第二，田间作物少。这都是搞农田基本建设的大好条件。“冬闲变冬忙，明秋多打粮”。我们这样想，也这样干。石头是硬的，冬季的土也是硬的，但是它硬不过毛泽东思想，硬不过用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。我们大寨的“铁姑娘队”，二十多名青年姑娘，她们从春到冬，披星星，戴月亮，干活抢重的，报酬总是少要，几年来如一日，从不叫苦，从不嫌累。难道她们真是铁打的吗？不，她们也是娘生爹养的，是肉长的。只是因为她们学了毛主席著作，学了就用，用了思想就变样，锻炼得比铁还硬，比钢还坚！
    改造自然要下定决心，同阶级敌人斗，更要下定决心。我们学习了毛主席的教导以后，决心越大，干劲越大，在走集体化道路、改造自然方面取得的成绩也越大。这可惹恼了那么一小撮坏家伙。我们越是下定决心同天斗，同地斗，他们就越是害怕，越是把大寨看作眼中钉、肉中刺，越是起劲地破坏和反对我们。在这种情况下，我们怎么办？最好的办法还是活学活用毛主席著作，还是下定决心同阶级敌人斗争到底。
    一九六三年大寨遭受特大洪灾，按照毛主席的教导，我们下定决心，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，去战胜灾害，仍然获得了好收成，做到了三不少：产的粮食不少；口粮不少；缴售给国家的粮食不少。这使敌人吓破了胆。在中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人的策划下，一九六四年派出工作队，带着资产阶级分子王××的“桃园经验”，打着搞“四清”的幌子，成心要搞垮大寨。他们诬蔑大寨的粮食产量高是弄虚作假；卖余粮多是打肿脸充胖子，是讨好；诬蔑大寨的干部是黑干部，假模范……。当时我们虽然还不知道他们这是奉了中国赫鲁晓夫的“圣旨”，但是也察觉到这个“工作队”来头不小，不怀好意。他们不是来干社会主义，而是要拆社会主义集体经济的台的。我们看准了，就下定决心，同他们寸步不让地进行斗争。我们宁肯被打成“反革命”，也不能让他们把毛主席亲手树立的大寨这面红旗抹黑。他们丈量土地，开仓查粮，都捞不到“把柄”，就给我们加上骄傲自满的罪名。我们说：骄傲自满是同停步不前，同不相信群众相连的。我们大寨活学活用毛主席著作，依靠集体经济，发挥了人的因素的作用，产量逐年增加，多售给国家，少留给自己，怎么能叫骄傲自满呢？他们又胡说我们的经营管理制度不合乎社会主义“按劳分配”原则，不是社员自愿的。我们说：我们大寨的经营管理制度好就好在突出政治，没有搞工分挂帅，这正是社员要求的。我们下定决心去同错误的和反动的言行斗，七斗八斗，在毛主席亲自制定的“二十三条”传达下来后，这个不怀好意的“四清工作队”，终于灰溜溜地被赶走了，我们又取得了胜利。
    下定决心，要方向明，目标正确
    下定决心，有个前提，就是要方向明，目标正确。不能滥下定决心，不能下错误的决心。正象毛主席教导我们的“……正确的部署来源于正确的决心”。同帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派斗争，同国内的地富反坏右和混进党内的走资派斗争，同自然灾害作斗争，这个方向对头，下定决心去斗，就是好，好得很！决心越大，胜利也越大。也有另外一种情况，象有的革命群众组织之间有了分歧，闹了矛盾，就不能下定决心去互相攻击。解决这样的分歧、矛盾，也要活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，但是要活学活用毛主席的“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式去解决。如果硬是举起拳头，嘴上喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲”的口号，去对自己的阶级兄弟作残酷的斗争，无情的打击，这个下定决心，方向就错了。下的决心越大，错误也越大。
    毛主席明确地告诉我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”毛主席还说：“如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”
    毛主席最近还指示我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的话句句是真理，一句顶一万句。学了毛主席这些教导，就要坚决照办。
    毛主席的每篇文章、每句话都是有的放矢的。有的话是针对敌人的，对自己人不能用；有的话是对自己人的，对敌人不能用。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，是对付形形色色的敌人，战胜各种各样困难的最强大的武器。援越抗美，打败美帝国主义的侵略，镇压国内阶级敌人的捣乱、破坏，斗倒斗臭混进党内的资产阶级代理人，就是要按照毛主席这一教导去斗争。在这样的革命斗争中牺牲了，是为人民利益而死，是死得其所，死得比泰山还重。如果在革命群众内部，因为观点不一致，一方要压倒另一方，也“下定决心，不怕牺牲”去斗争，那就不对了，作这样的牺牲是不值得的。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是，党内一小撮走资派还不甘心自己的失败。他们在暗地里瞅机会制造混乱。如果我们革命群众组织之间搞派性，闹磨擦，打“内战”，就给了他们钻空子的机会。这在客观上就是长了资产阶级的志气，灭了无产阶级的威风。
    在这里也有个下定决心的问题，就是下定决心分清敌我，下定决心正确处理人民内部的争论，下定决心提高警惕，不上阶级敌人的当。
    下定决心，要从“公”字出发，不能从“私”字出发
    毛主席的书是为无产阶级写的，为劳动人民写的，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。毛主席的每一句话都体现了劳动人民的根本利益，都是为公的。活学活用“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这个教导，就有个为公还是为私的问题。为公就对了，为私就错了；不能颠倒，不能混淆。学习毛主席这个教导，象学习毛主席的其他教导一样，为公就能用得上，用得好，用出成绩；如果从“私”字出发，那就用不上，用不出好结果。
    大寨大队一九六三年遭受特大灾害的时候，大队的仓库快要倒塌了，大队领导号召大家抢救粮食。社员贾承先正在家里抢救自己的粮食，已经把缸里的粮食灌进口袋里。他听到广播，就下定决心，宁肯牺牲个人的利益，也不叫集体的利益受损失。他把灌好的粮食又倒进缸里，拿起口袋赶到仓库，抢救大队的粮食。这时，有一个富裕中农社员，也下了决心：一心一意看守自己的房屋，抢救自己的粮食，生怕丢失一粒。他还讥笑贾承先是“傻瓜”，说什么：“你抢救了集体的粮食，你能分到几斤？”等到贾承先再回到家里时，房屋倒了，粮食、衣物也全埋在里边；说贾承先为公忘私是“傻瓜”的那个富裕中农社员的房屋也没剩下。对这两种不同的决心，社员有两种不同的反应：对于贾承先，一致称赞是毛主席教育出来的好社员；对于那个富裕中农，社员批评他人到了社会主义，思想还在资本主义。
    这就是说，下定决心必须是“公”字当头，为公去下定决心。那种为了私人的利益去下定决心，同毛主席教导的下定决心是水火不相容的。
    用不用，是真学假学的试金石，也是对毛泽东思想的态度问题
    “读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”这几句话，说一说容易，真正做起来不是那么轻而易举。毛主席的书，大家都在念，都在背。究竟谁真正在学，谁学得最好？唯一的标准是看学了用不用。
    读得再多，背得再熟，用得很少，或者不用，那就证明不是真学。相反，学一句就用一句，学用结合，立竿见影，那就是真学了，而且学出了水平。毛主席说：“如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。”这正说出了我们心里的话。读了毛主席的书，就是要用来说明问题，解决问题。
    毛主席著作是智慧的宝库。学了就用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能使人变得最聪明，站得高，看得远，心红眼亮方向明。
    学了毛主席著作用不用，也是对待毛泽东思想的态度问题。我们热爱伟大领袖毛主席，就要紧跟；紧跟就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话；听毛主席的话，就要做到毛主席怎样说，我们就怎样做，事事紧跟，句句照办。读了毛主席的书，不照毛主席的话去做，另外搞一套，就不是真紧跟，也不是真正热爱。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席说：对于毛主席著作，“现在不是学不学的问题，而是真正学到没学到的问题，真正会用不会用的问题。”林副主席号召：“更加加紧学习毛主席著作，一定要联系实际，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。我们大寨的贫下中农，几年来在大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上下功夫，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，做出了成绩。但是，同林彪副主席的要求，还差得很远。今后，我们一定继续以解放军为榜样，象毛主席的好战士、“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志那样，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，生为毛主席的革命路线而奋斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。我们下定决心建设一个永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的红彤彤的新大寨，让活学活用毛主席著作的传统世世代代传下去！
