A grand gathering was held in Tirana to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the death of Albania's national hero, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. Albania will stand forever victorious.

Albania's great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, attended the event. Comrade Mehmet Shehu delivered a lengthy speech.

Tirana, January 18 — January 17 marked the 500th anniversary of the death of Albania's national hero, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. On the evening of January 16, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, and the Council of Ministers of Albania held a grand commemorative meeting at the Tirana Cultural Palace.

Albania's great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, along with Comrades Haxhi Lleshi and Mehmet Shehu, attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Comrade Hysni Kapo, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party and a Secretary of the Central Committee. Comrade Mehmet Shehu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu said: In the 15th century, the Albanian people, under the leadership of national hero Skanderbeg, waged a heroic struggle. The heroic Albanian people preferred to die standing rather than live kneeling. They did not surrender to any enemy.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu emphasized that in the struggle of the Albanian people against the Turkish invaders, the decisive factor and the sole source of their heroic resistance and victory was the masses of the people, mainly the peasants.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu said, Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "The Party holds high the banner of the struggle for freedom, making the fighting traditions of our people shine more brilliantly and continuing the epic of the Skanderbeg era more gloriously..."

Comrade Mehmet Shehu pointed out: November 29, 1944, is the day when our national flag flew again over our free homeland, the day when our people achieved their final victory. This is the first time in our country's history that the Albanian people, under the leadership of our Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have achieved a true, complete, and permanent victory.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu stressed that for our people and our Party, it is a great fortune that our Party, from the day of its establishment, has been led by the glorious founder, organizer, and mentor of our Party, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu said: Today, 500 years after the death of Skanderbeg, and 23 years after the establishment of the people's power, our homeland and our people have cast off all shackles—foreign shackles and the shackles of the exploiting classes within the country. They are firmly advancing on the road to socialism and communism, and no force in the world can drag them away from this road.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu said: Hundreds of years ago, our people, under the leadership of Skanderbeg, successfully resisted the Ottoman invaders for 25 years. Today, our people, under the leadership of the Party of Labour, can cope with any situation and, if necessary, wage armed struggle against possible invaders for a hundred times longer under a hundred times more difficult conditions. Because today, we are a hundred times stronger than in the era of Skanderbeg a few hundred years ago.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu said: Today, socialist Albania is not isolated; she stands together with many comrades, first and foremost the great People's Republic of China, in the forefront of the struggle against the two most vicious enemies of the peoples of all countries—imperialism and modern revisionism. As Comrade Mao Zedong has said, Albania today has become "a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

Comrade Mehmet Shehu pointed out: Today, socialist Albania, led by the far-sighted Party of Labour, this Party which has always been loyal to the interests of the people, to the road of socialism and communism. Albania has a people who are invincible and stronger than ever before, who understand the justice of their cause, who understand the boundless vitality of Marxism-Leninism, who understand the clear line of the glorious Party of Labour. They are united around the Party and have become an invincible force. Albania also has a strong army, ready to brave fire and water, to fight decisively against the enemy and achieve final victory, no matter how large the enemy force is, and under any circumstances.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu pointed out: Socialist Albania has a powerful ally, the great People's Republic of China, guided by the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. Albania also has the support of the peoples of all countries in the world.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu concluded: No force in the world can defeat the new socialist Albania. Albania stands tall and will stand forever proudly, resolutely, and victoriously.

Before this meeting, the Albanian people also held a series of commemorative activities.

On January 11, the people of Tirana, the capital of Albania, held an unveiling ceremony for the statue of Skanderbeg in the city center's Skanderbeg Square. Comrade Enver Hoxha personally unveiled the statue.

On January 15, about 20,000 Albanian people gathered in Kruja, the political and military center during Skanderbeg's time, to hold a grand meeting commemorating the 500th anniversary of the death of this national hero. Comrades Enver Hoxha, Haxhi Lleshi, and Mehmet Shehu also attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, announced on behalf of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania that the city of Kruja was awarded the title of "Hero City."

Starting from January 12, academic conferences, lectures, and symposiums related to Skanderbeg were held throughout Albania.

    地拉那隆重集会纪念民族英雄斯坎德培逝世五百周年
    阿尔巴尼亚将世世代代胜利地屹立着
    阿人民伟大领袖霍查同志出席　谢胡同志作长篇讲话
    新华社地拉那十八日电　一月十七日是阿尔巴尼亚民族英雄乔治·康斯坦丁·斯坎德培逝世五百周年纪念日。十六日晚，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议在地拉那文化宫举行了盛大的纪念集会。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志以及列希、谢胡等同志出席了大会。
    大会由劳动党中央政治局委员、劳动党中央书记处书记卡博同志主持。劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席谢胡同志在会上作了长篇讲话。
    谢胡同志说：在十五世纪，阿尔巴尼亚人民在民族英雄斯坎德培领导下进行了英勇的斗争。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在战斗中宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生。他们在任何敌人面前也不屈服。
    谢胡同志强调指出，在那场阿尔巴尼亚人民反对土耳其侵略者的斗争中，进行英勇抵抗和取得胜利的决定性因素和唯一的源泉，是人民大众，主要是农民。
    谢胡同志说，霍查同志曾经说过：“党紧握着为自由而斗争的旗帜，使我国人民的战斗传统发扬光大，更加壮丽地续写了斯坎德培时代的史诗……”。
    谢胡同志指出：一九四四年十一月二十九日是我国国旗再次在我们自由的祖国飘扬的日子，是我国人民取得最后胜利的日子。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的我党领导下，在我国历史上第一次取得的真正的、完全和永久的胜利。
    谢胡同志强调说，对于我国人民和我们党来说，非常幸运的是，我们党从建立之日起，就是由我党的光荣的创建者、组织者和导师恩维尔·霍查同志领导的。
    谢胡同志说：今天，在斯坎德培逝世五百年以后，在人民政权建立二十三年以后，我们的祖国和我国人民摆脱了一切桎梏——外国的桎梏和本国的剥削阶级的桎梏。他们在社会主义和共产主义的道路上坚定地前进，世界上没有任何力量能把他们从这条道路上拉走。
    谢胡同志说：几百年以前，我国人民在斯坎德培的领导下胜利地抵抗了奥斯曼入侵者达二十五年之久。今天，我国人民在劳动党的领导下能够应付任何形势，必要时能够在困难百倍的情况下，对可能的侵略者进行时间长百倍的武装斗争。因为，我们今天比几百年前斯坎德培的时代要强大百倍。
    谢胡同志说：今天，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚并不孤立，她同许多战友，首先是伟大的人民中国，联合在一起，站在反对各国人民两个最凶恶的敌人——帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争的最前列。正如毛泽东同志所说的，阿尔巴尼亚今天已“成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”。
    谢胡同志指出：今天，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，为卓有远见的劳动党所领导，这个党始终忠于人民的利益，忠于社会主义和共产主义的道路。阿尔巴尼亚有始终威武不屈、空前强大的人民，他们懂得他们事业的正义性，懂得马克思列宁主义的无限生命力，懂得光荣的劳动党的明确的路线。他们团结在党的周围，成为强大无比的力量。阿尔巴尼亚还有一支强大的军队，这支军队随时准备赴汤蹈火，同敌军坚决战斗并取得最后胜利，不管这支敌军有多么庞大，也不管在任何情况之下。
    谢胡同志指出：社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚有强大的盟国，即以毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想为指导的伟大的人民中国。阿尔巴尼亚还得到全世界各国人民的支持。
    谢胡同志最后说：世界上没有任何力量足以打败新的社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚。阿尔巴尼亚屹立着，并将世世代代骄傲地、刚毅地、胜利地屹立着。
    在这次大会以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民还举行了一系列的纪念活动。
    十一日，阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那人民在市中心斯坎德培广场举行了斯坎德培塑像的揭幕典礼。霍查同志亲自为斯坎德培塑像揭幕剪彩。
    十五日，阿尔巴尼亚人民约二万人在斯坎德培时期的政治和军事中心克鲁亚城，举行了纪念这位民族英雄逝世五百周年的盛大集会。霍查、列希和谢胡等同志也出席了大会。
    会上，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席列希同志代表阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团向大会宣布，授予克鲁亚城以“英雄城市”的称号。
    从十二日起，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地还举办了有关斯坎德培的学术会议、讲演会、座谈会等纪念活动。
