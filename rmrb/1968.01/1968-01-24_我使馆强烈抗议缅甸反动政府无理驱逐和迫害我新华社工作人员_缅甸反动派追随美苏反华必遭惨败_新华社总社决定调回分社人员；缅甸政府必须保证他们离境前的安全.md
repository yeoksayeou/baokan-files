Our Embassy Strongly Protests the Unreasonable Expulsion and Persecution of Our Xinhua News Agency Staff by the Reactionary Government of Burma

The Reactionary Clique of Burma, Following the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Anti-China Policies, Will Surely Meet with a Disastrous Defeat

Xinhua News Agency Headquarters Decides to Recall Staff from the Branch Office; Burmese Government Must Guarantee Their Safety Before Departure

	BEIJING, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) - YANGON, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) - The Chinese Embassy in Burma issued a note on January 23 to the Burmese Foreign Ministry, strongly protesting the unreasonable expulsion and persecution of Xinhua News Agency staff members Teng Wenqi and Li Chengyi in Yangon by the Burmese reactionary government. The full text of the note is as follows:

	The Embassy of the People's Republic of China, regarding the unreasonable expulsion and persecution of Xinhua News Agency staff members in Yangon, states the following to the Burmese Foreign Ministry:

	On January 20, the Burmese Immigration Bureau notified Xinhua News Agency staff members Teng Wenqi and Li Chengyi that they must leave Burma by January 31 and must complete their departure procedures by January 24. This is a further serious step by the Burmese government to worsen relations between the two countries and is a serious provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese Embassy strongly protests this action by the Burmese government.

	The Burmese government's unreasonable measures are planned and premeditated. Since January 9, the Burmese government, disregarding internationally recognized diplomatic norms, has dispatched agents to surveil the Chinese Embassy and tail diplomatic personnel. On January 19, Teng Wenqi, upon an appointment, went to the Burmese Registration Bureau to meet with the bureau chief. After the meeting, the Burmese government openly dispatched agents to seize Teng Wenqi and block the car he was in, attempting to forcibly abduct him. Although this plot failed, Teng Wenqi was seriously injured. Subsequently, the executive secretary of the Burmese Foreign Ministry, U Ohn Kyin, openly declared to the Chinese Embassy's acting charge d'affaires that the Burmese government would arrest and interrogate Xinhua News Agency staff members in Yangon and threatened that as long as these personnel remained in the Chinese Embassy, Burmese judicial authorities had the right to take whatever measures they deemed appropriate. Now, the Burmese government has arbitrarily ordered Teng Wenqi and Li Chengyi to leave the country. This fully demonstrates that the Burmese government is deliberately creating new anti-China incidents and stirring up a new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment.

	During their work in Burma, Xinhua News Agency staff members in Yangon have consistently worked to promote traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma and have strictly adhered to the agreements signed between the two countries' news agencies. According to the still-valid agreement between the two news agencies, Xinhua News Agency in Yangon has the right to publish Xinhua News Agency news releases. Before the old registration certificate expired on October 21 last year, Xinhua News Agency in Yangon applied for an extension two weeks in advance. However, due to the Burmese government's unreasonable delays, the extension procedure could not be completed in time. Now, the Burmese government is falsely accusing Xinhua News Agency in Yangon of publishing Xinhua News Agency news releases in violation of Burmese law and using this as an excuse to persecute and expel Xinhua News Agency staff members, which is completely unreasonable. The Chinese Embassy must point out that Xinhua News Agency is the national news agency of the People's Republic of China, and its staff members are Chinese government employees. If the Burmese government, disregarding the protests of the Chinese government, persecutes Xinhua News Agency staff members in Yangon, it must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

	In view of the Burmese government's deliberate persecution of Teng Wenqi and Li Chengyi, their personal safety is no longer guaranteed, and their normal news work cannot be carried out. The Xinhua News Agency Headquarters has decided to recall them to China. The Chinese Embassy demands that the Burmese government must guarantee their safety before they leave Burma.

	The Chinese Embassy once again warns the Burmese government that those who follow the United States and the Soviet Union's modern revisionism in anti-China policies will surely meet with a disastrous defeat. The more they perform, the more they will fail. If you continue down the path of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, you will inevitably end in complete failure.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Jan. 23 - YANGON - The Burmese reactionary government, following the instructions of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, is intensifying its anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, brazenly violating the agreements signed between the two countries' news agencies, and unreasonably expelling Xinhua News Agency staff members in Yangon, while plotting illegal arrests and interrogations.

	On January 19, Xinhua News Agency staff member Teng Wenqi, according to a pre-arranged appointment, went to the Burmese Registration Bureau to meet with the bureau chief to discuss the extension of the registration certificate for publishing Xinhua News Agency news releases. After the conversation ended, the Burmese reactionary government's agents, who had been lying in wait at the Registration Bureau, openly ordered Teng Wenqi to stay. When their unreasonable demands were rejected by Teng Wenqi and the Chinese Embassy staff member Gong Husheng, who was present, these agents openly assaulted Teng Wenqi, attempting to forcibly abduct and beat him, and tried to obstruct Teng Wenqi from leaving and getting into the car. In this incident, Teng Wenqi was injured by Burmese agents.

	Chinese Embassy acting charge d'affaires Xiao Ming, on January 20, strongly protested to the Burmese Foreign Ministry's executive secretary U Ohn Kyin, demanding that the Burmese reactionary government immediately apologize to the Chinese government for the abduction of Xinhua News Agency staff members and the obstruction of the embassy car, immediately withdraw surveillance agents and vehicles from the Chinese Embassy, and ensure the safety of all Chinese government staff members in Burma.

	The Burmese reactionary government's deep-seated hatred and various persecutions of Xinhua News Agency in Yangon are an important part of their crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese conspiracy. The Burmese reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions will only result in "lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet."

    我使馆强烈抗议缅甸反动政府无理驱逐和迫害我新华社工作人员
    缅甸反动派追随美苏反华必遭惨败
    新华社总社决定调回分社人员；缅甸政府必须保证他们离境前的安全
    新华社二十三日讯仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十三日照会缅甸联邦外交部，强烈抗议缅甸反动政府无理驱逐和迫害新华社驻仰光分社工作人员滕文启和李成义的罪恶行径。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国大使馆就缅甸政府无理驱逐和迫害新华社驻仰光分社工作人员事，向缅甸联邦外交部申述如下：
    一月二十日，缅甸政府移民局通知新华社驻仰光分社工作人员滕文启和李成义，限令他们于一月三十一日以前离开缅甸，并且要求他们于一月二十四日以前到缅甸移民局办理离境手续。这是缅甸政府进一步恶化中缅两国关系的又一严重步骤，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。对此，中国大使馆向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。
    缅甸政府这一无理措施是有计划有预谋的。自今年一月九日起，缅甸政府就不顾公认的国际关系准则，派特务监视中国大使馆和跟踪大使馆外交人员。一月十九日，滕文启应约到缅甸注册局会见注册局长，会见后，缅甸政府公然出动特务，扭住滕文启，并拦阻滕文启所乘的汽车，企图强行绑架。这一阴谋虽未得逞，但滕文启已被严重扭伤。事后，缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦，公然向中国大使馆临时代办宣称，缅甸政府要逮捕和审讯新华社驻仰光分社工作人员，并威胁说，只要这些人员继续留在中国大使馆内，缅甸司法机关人员就完全有权采取他们认为妥善的措施。现在缅甸政府又悍然限令滕文启和李成义离境。这就充分说明，缅甸政府蓄意制造新的反华事件，掀起新的反华排华浪潮。
    新华社驻仰光分社工作人员在缅甸工作期间，一贯为促进中缅两国人民的传统友谊而工作，一贯严格遵守中缅两国通讯社之间所签订的有关协定。根据现仍有效的双方通讯社的协定，新华社驻仰光分社完全有权发行新华社新闻稿。在旧的登记证去年十月二十一日到期前两周，新华社驻仰光分社就向缅甸印刷出版注册局申请延期。但是，由于缅甸政府无理拖延，才未能及时办理延期手续。现在，缅甸政府居然诬蔑新华社驻仰光分社发行新华社新闻稿，违反了缅甸的法律，并利用这一借口对新华社驻仰光分社人员进行迫害和驱逐，这完全是无理的。中国大使馆必须严正指出，新华通讯社是中华人民共和国的国家通讯社，其工作人员是中国政府工作人员。缅甸政府如果不顾中国政府的抗议，对新华社驻仰光分社工作人员进行迫害，它就必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    鉴于缅甸政府蓄意迫害滕文启和李成义，他们两人的人身安全已经没有保障，其正常的新闻工作已无法进行，中国新华社总社决定将他们调回中国。中国大使馆要求缅甸政府必须保证他们在离开缅甸以前的安全。
    中国大使馆再次正告缅甸政府，凡是追随美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义反华的人，是决没有好下场的。他们表演得越充分，就失败得越惨。如果你们继续沿着反华排华的道路走下去，就必然以彻底失败而告终。
    据新华社二十三日讯仰光消息：缅甸反动政府秉承美帝和苏修的意旨加紧反华排华，悍然违反中缅两国通讯社之间签订的协定，无理驱逐新华社驻仰光分社工作人员，并阴谋进行非法逮捕和审讯。
    一月十九日，新华社仰光分社工作人员滕文启根据事先的约会，前往缅甸注册局会见注册局长，商谈有关延长新华社新闻稿出版登记证问题。谈话结束后，早已埋伏在注册局的缅甸反动政府的特务多人，就出面强令滕文启留下。当他们的无理要求遭到滕文启和在场的中国大使馆随员龚沪生严正拒绝后，这些特务竟公然动手对滕文启强行绑架和扭打，并妄图阻挠滕文启出门登车。在这次事件中，滕文启被缅甸特务扭伤。
    中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明，在二十日向缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦提出强烈抗议，并要求缅甸反动政府立即就绑架新华社工作人员和阻拦大使馆汽车事向中国政府赔礼道歉，立即撤除监视中国大使馆的特务人员和车辆，切实保证中国驻缅甸大使馆和所有中国政府驻缅甸代表机构工作人员的安全等。
    缅甸反动政府对新华社仰光分社的刻骨仇恨和种种迫害，是它疯狂反华排华的阴谋计划的一个重要组成部分。缅甸反动政府这些反华排华的倒行逆施，其结果只会是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
