The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau system are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly executing Chairman Mao's instructions, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. The main stations and sections of the entire bureau have achieved revolutionary great unity, many units have established revolutionary committees, train operations are normal, and freight volume is increasing month by month. The broad revolutionary workers are determined to, in the new year, further seriously study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau system are seriously executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, step by step following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasping the revolution, and promoting production. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent and getting better and better.

The Beijing Railway Bureau, located at the center of the national railway transportation network, is responsible for the railway transportation of Hebei, Shanxi, and Beijing, two provinces and one municipality. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," was issued, the two factions of revolutionary masses in the Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Zhangjiakou regions immediately responded and united on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought with the spirit of "seizing the day." Now, over 150 main stations and sections under the Beijing Railway Bureau have all achieved revolutionary great unity according to systems and administrative departments. The broad railway workers are carrying out the revolution vigorously and production is booming. The entire bureau's train operations are normal, and the coal transportation production index is increasing month by month. The average number of coal cars transported per day in November last year increased by 22% compared to October; and in the first and middle of December, it increased by an average of 11% compared to November.

Under the help of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, the proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau system have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoted the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, closely linked with reality, seriously carried out self-criticism, and fought against the "self" in their minds. They have sparked a revolution in their souls and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great unity from a ideological standpoint. The first station in the Beijing Railway Bureau to achieve revolutionary great unity, Guang'anmen Station, originally had the leaders of the two factions study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continue to fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and root out the "self." This has made the revolutionary great unity more solid. They also enthusiastically helped cadres who made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established a revolutionary committee on October 11th last year. The People's Liberation Army supporting the left in the Beijing Railway Bureau timely summarized the experience of the revolutionary workers at Guang'anmen Station in strictly following Chairman Mao's latest instructions and closely following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and promoted it throughout the bureau, powerfully promoting the development of the entire bureau's movement. Currently, the Beijing Railway Bureau has established revolutionary committees in the Beijing and Shijiazhuang railway sub-bureaus; and in the affiliated stations, sections, and other units, 80% have established revolutionary committees.

With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau system have concentrated on criticizing the revisionist goods such as the quota-first and material incentives advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Ministry of Railways, breaking all the old rules in the railway department since the Qing Dynasty, and planting the thought of serving the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They have closely linked the revolutionary big criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units.

After achieving revolutionary great unity, the workers' spiritual outlook has been renewed, and the entire bureau presents a prosperous scene of "grasp the revolution, promote production." Since October last year, with the leap in industrial and agricultural production, the freight volume of this bureau has surged. In the tense and busy transportation situation, the workers have done everything possible to maintain normal transportation order, prepare for loading and unloading in advance, and transport more and faster the materials urgently needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihood.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of this bureau are further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, launching a new high tide of fighting the self and criticizing revisionism. They are determined to, in the new year, further grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    北京铁路局系统革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    执行毛主席指示坚定不移  革命和生产形势越来越好
    全局主要站、段已实现革命大联合，许多单位成立革命委员会，列车运行秩序正常，货运量逐月上升。广大革命职工决心在新的一年里，进一步认真活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    据新华社讯　北京铁路局系统的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，认真执行毛主席的最新指示，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命、生产形势大好，而且越来越好。
    位居全国铁路运输中枢的北京铁路局，担负着河北、山西和北京两省一市的铁路运输任务。毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示下达以后，这个局所属的北京、天津、石家庄、张家口等地区的两派革命群众组织，立即闻风而动，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，以“只争朝夕”的精神联合起来。现在，北京铁路局所属的一百五十多个主要站、段，已经全部按系统、按行政部门实现了革命的大联合。广大铁路工人革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热火朝天。全局列车运行秩序正常，煤炭运输生产指标逐月上升。去年十一月份平均每天装运煤炭车数，比十月份增长了百分之二十二；十二月上、中旬又比十一月平均增长了百分之十一。
    北京铁路局系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在支左的解放军的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大兴毛主席提倡的革命好学风，密切联系实际，认真开展自我批评，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合。北京铁路局第一个实现革命大联合的广安门车站，原来两派组织的负责人学习了毛主席的最新指示，继续狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，狠挖“私”字，使革命大联合更加巩固。他们还热忱地帮助犯有错误的干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来，促进了革命的三结合，在去年十月十一日就成立了革命委员会。在北京铁路局支左的解放军及时总结了广安门车站革命职工对毛主席最新指示句句照办，对毛主席战略部署步步紧跟的经验，在全局范围内推广，有力地推动了全局运动的发展。目前，北京铁路局已有北京和石家庄两个铁路分局成立了革命委员会；在所属的站、段等单位，成立革命委员会的已达百分之八十。
    北京铁路局系统的革命职工，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，集中目标狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁道部的代理人所推行的指标挂帅、物质刺激等修正主义黑货，破除了铁路部门从清朝以来的一切陋规，大树为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的思想。并且把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。
    实现革命大联合后，职工们的精神面貌焕然一新，全局呈现一派欣欣向荣的“抓革命，促生产”的新气象。去年十月份以来，随着工农业生产的跃进，这个局的货运量猛增。在紧张繁忙的运输情况下，职工们千方百计保持正常运输秩序，提前做好装车、卸车的准备，多运、快运工农业生产和人民生活所急需的物资。
    目前，这个局的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，正在进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，掀起斗私批修的新高潮。他们决心在新的一年里，进一步狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
