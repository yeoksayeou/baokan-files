Albanian and Vietnamese newspapers and the Liberation Radio Station of South Vietnam have published articles and commentaries strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist spy ship's war provocation against Korea.

	New China News Agency, Tirana, January 29 - The editorial of the Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" on January 28 condemned the U.S. imperialist spy ship's intrusion into Korean territorial waters, strongly denouncing the U.S. imperialists' war provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

	The article said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's capture of the U.S. spy ship in its own territorial waters is a correct and completely legal action. The era of gunboat diplomacy, where U.S. imperialist ships could bully other peoples' countries thousands of kilometers away from the U.S. coast, has long passed. The banditry of the U.S. spy ship was a premeditated provocation plotted in the dark offices of the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency. The U.S. imperialists cannot escape their serious responsibility.

	The article emphasized that the latest U.S. provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not an isolated incident. It is an inseparable part of the U.S.'s overall policy of aggression and criminal activities it is carrying out in Vietnam, Laos, and against the People's Republic of China and other countries in the Far East.

	The article pointed out that in response to the U.S. conspiracies and war threats, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has the right to punish the pirates and take all necessary measures to ensure the inviolability of its borders and national sovereignty. The captain of the spy ship, Lloyd M. Bucher, has confessed to the U.S. aggressors' spy activities. The U.S. government must also publicly admit this.

	The article pointed out that the U.S. government is now asking the Security Council to investigate the "Pueblo" incident, attempting to use this organization to cover up its aggression against the Korean people. The United Nations Organization and its agencies have no right to discuss the issue of the capture of the U.S. spy ship. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a free, independent, and self-reliant country, fully entitled to self-defense and resistance against any enemy's aggression. It also has the right to try and punish the "Pueblo" pirates who committed criminal activities against it according to its own laws.

	The article concluded that the Albanian people have always supported the Korean people and will continue to support them in their just struggle to defend their freedom, independence, and realize their national aspirations.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 28 - The "People's Daily" of Vietnam published an editorial on January 26 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' dispatch of the armed spy ship "Pueblo" to intrude into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a new act of war provocation. The editorial said that the confession of the captain of the "Pueblo," Lloyd M. Bucher, is irrefutable evidence of the U.S. crime. However, the U.S. imperialists not only deny their crimes but also threaten war. But all their warlike bluster only exposes their stubborn and warlike nature and their escalating provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

	The editorial said that the "Pueblo" incident is neither an isolated incident nor the first provocation by the U.S. against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the U.S. imperialists have been constantly violating this agreement and conducting frenzied military provocations.

	The editorial said that the Vietnamese people, together with the people of the world, strongly condemn the crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists against the brotherly people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and warmly welcome the deserved lesson given by the Korean People's Army to the U.S. war provocateurs.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 28 - The Liberation Radio Station of South Vietnam published a commentary on January 26 condemning the U.S. imperialists' dispatch of the spy ship "Pueblo" to intrude into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to conduct spy activities.

	The commentary pointed out that the capture of this U.S. spy ship by the Korean People's Army is a completely legal action in accordance with justice, international law, and the sacred inviolable rights of an independent and sovereign state.

	The commentary said that this action is also a well-deserved blow to the U.S. imperialists who have always violated the sovereignty, territory, airspace, and territorial waters of various countries.

	The commentary condemned the U.S. authorities' threats and warlike actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and pointed out that the U.S. authorities must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this action.

	The commentary recalled the many spy, provocative, sabotage, and military attacks carried out by the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Park Chung-hee clique, against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and pointed out that the "Pueblo" provocation incident is part of the U.S. conspiracy against this country.

	The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists must immediately stop all hostile actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, withdraw all their troops from South Korea, and let the Korean people solve the problem of reunifying their country on their own.

    阿尔巴尼亚、越南报纸和越南南方解放电台分别发表文章和评论
    强烈谴责美帝间谍船对朝鲜进行战争挑衅
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十八日就美帝国主义的间谍船侵入朝鲜领海事件发表编辑部文章，强烈谴责美帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争挑衅。
    文章说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在自己的领海内俘获美国间谍船，是正确的和完全合法的行动。美帝国主义船只能够在距美国海岸数千公里之处对其他人民的国家作威作福的炮舰时代已经一去不复返了。美国间谍船的强盗行径是在五角大楼和中央情报局阴暗的办公室里蓄意策划的一件预谋挑衅。美帝国主义不能逃避它应负的严重责任。
    文章强调指出，美帝对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的最新挑衅不是偶然的，也不是孤立的事件。它是美国正在越南、老挝以及对人民中国和远东其他国家所执行的总的侵略政策和罪恶活动的不可分割的一部分。
    文章在谈到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对美国的阴谋和战争讹诈给予的反击时指出，朝鲜人民自己有权利惩罚海盗以及为了确保自己边境和国家主权的不可侵犯而采取一切必要措施。间谍船船长劳埃德·马克·布克已供认美国侵略者进行的间谍活动。美国政府也必须公开承认这一点。
    文章指出，美国政府现在要求安理会调查“普韦布洛号”事件，企图通过这个组织掩盖自己对朝鲜人民的侵略。联合国组织及其机构无权讨论俘获美国间谍船问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是一个自由的、独立自主的国家，完全有权利自卫和抵抗任何敌人的侵犯。也完全有权利根据自己的法律审判和惩办对其进行罪恶活动的“普韦布洛号”海盗。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯支持朝鲜人民，今后仍将继续支持他们为保卫自己的自由、独立和实现自己的民族愿望而进行的正义斗争。
    据新华社河内二十八日电　越南《人民报》二十六日发表社论，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海的新的战争挑衅行动。社论说，“普韦布洛号”船长劳埃德·马克·布克的认罪书是美国犯罪行动的无可抵赖的证据。但是美帝国主义不仅抵赖他们的罪行，而且还以战争相威胁。然而他们的一切黩武叫嚣都吓不倒任何人，只不过暴露他们的顽固和好战的本性以及他们对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的加紧挑衅。
    社论说，“普韦布洛号”事件既不是一个孤立事件，也不是美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的头一次挑衅行动。自从朝鲜停战协定签字以来，美帝国主义就不断地破坏这一协定，疯狂进行军事挑衅。
    社论说，越南人民同世界人民一道，强烈谴责美帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国兄弟人民犯下的罪行，热烈欢呼朝鲜人民军给予美国战争挑衅者的应得的教训。
    新华社河内二十八日电　越南南方解放电台二十六日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义派遣间谍船“普韦布洛号”入侵朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海进行间谍活动。
    评论指出，朝鲜人民军俘获这艘美国间谍船是一种符合正义、国际法，符合一个独立和主权国家神圣不可侵犯的权利的完全合法的行动。
    评论说，这种行动也是对一贯侵犯各国主权、领土、领空和领海的美帝国主义者应有的打击。
    评论谴责美国当局对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的威胁和好战行动，并且指出，美国当局必须对这一行动所产生的后果承担全部责任。
    评论追述了美帝国主义者及其走狗朴正熙集团对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的许多间谍、挑衅、破坏行动和军事进攻后指出，“普韦布洛号”挑衅事件，是美国反对这个国家的阴谋诡计的一部分。
    评论说，美帝国主义者必须立即停止对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一切敌对行动，必须从南朝鲜撤走其全部军队，并让朝鲜人民自己来解决重新统一他们的国家的问题。
