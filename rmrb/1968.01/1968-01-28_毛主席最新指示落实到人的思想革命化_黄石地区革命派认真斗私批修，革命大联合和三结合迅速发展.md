The proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi, a new industrial city in Hubei Province, with workers as the main force, have, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." Revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are surging forward, and the situation is better than ever. At present, more than 98 percent of the grassroots units in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity, and more than half of the grassroots units have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups. The city has held workers' and peasants' congresses respectively, and schools at all levels have generally achieved revolutionary great unity and resumed classes to make revolution.

Huangshi is a new industrial city. The working class in the city is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they learn and apply them quickly, achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, which has powerfully promoted the cultural revolution on all fronts in the city and fully played the role of the working class as the main force.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the first thing is to implement them in the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is the most fundamental characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi insist on taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, starting from the education of the situation and class education, widely setting up classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, and taking the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the central task. They take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fight against "selfishness" on a large scale, expose and criticize factionalism on a large scale, greatly promoting the revolutionization of thinking, and ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The two factions of the revolutionary masses in the 15th Smelting Lane Company had not been able to achieve revolutionary great unity because they had not solved the problem from the ideological level. With the help of the PLA, the leaders of the two factions sat down together to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Following Chairman Mao's teachings of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and "the two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences," both sides did more self-criticism, exposed the sins of factionalism, and criticized the harm of factionalism, forming a high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. In the end, both sides agreed to establish a unified revolutionary organization, achieving revolutionary great unity.

To firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, arm the broad revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, start from the overall situation, start from the actual situation of the unit, and take practical actions to achieve revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the unit, laying the foundation and creating conditions for achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the whole city, this is another characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the proletarian revolutionary masses in factories and mines such as Dongfeng Cement Plant, Hubei Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, and Huangshi Thermal Power Plant acted swiftly, bringing everyone's thoughts and actions into line with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making everyone think about implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, talk about implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and take steps to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with a spirit of "seizing the day," eliminating interference, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They further consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity and quickly achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination, becoming the first batch of enterprises in the city to establish revolutionary committees.

To learn from the advanced, find the gap, carry forward the positive factors, and insist on continuous revolution and strive to be the best, this is another prominent characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian revolutionary masses in Huangshi looked at other places, thought about their own place, looked at other units, thought about their own unit, looked at the masses, and thought about themselves, becoming more and more excited and more and more enthusiastic. Some units that originally thought they were not bad felt that their consciousness was not as high as others, and their actions were not as fast as others. They rose up to catch up, the masses urged the leaders, and the leaders led the masses, quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    毛主席最新指示落实到人的思想革命化
    黄石地区革命派认真斗私批修，革命大联合和三结合迅速发展
    据新华社武汉二十七日电　湖北黄石地区以产业工人为主体的无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军的帮助下，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流滚滚向前，形势空前大好。目前，全市百分之九十八以上的基层单位实现了革命大联合，一半以上基层单位成立了革命委员会或革筹小组。全市分别召开了工代会和农代会，中、小学校普遍实现了革命大联合，复课闹革命。
    黄石是一个新兴的工业城市。全市工人阶级最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话。在落实毛主席的最新指示中，他们学了就用，迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，有力地推动了全市各条战线的文化大革命，充分发挥了工人阶级主力军的作用。
    全面落实毛主席最新指示，首先落实到实现人的思想革命化上，这是黄石地区无产阶级革命派落实毛主席最新指示最根本的特点。黄石地区无产阶级革命派坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，从形势教育和阶级教育入手，广泛开办了毛泽东思想学习班，把落实毛主席最新指示作为中心任务。他们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，大斗“私”字，大揭大批派性，大大促进了思想革命化，保证了毛主席最新指示的落实。十五冶井巷公司的两派革命群众组织过去因为没有从思想上解决问题，革命大联合始终没有实现。在解放军的帮助下，这个单位的两派革命群众组织的头头，首先坐到一起认真学习、深刻领会毛主席最新指示，遵照毛主席“要斗私，批修”，“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，双方各自多作自我批评，大摆派性的罪过，大批派性的危害，形成了一个斗私批修的高潮。最后，双方一致同意成立统一的革命组织，实现了革命大联合。
    牢牢掌握斗争大方向，用毛主席最新指示武装广大革命群众，从全局着眼，从本单位入手，以搞好本单位的革命大联合和革命三结合的实际行动，为实现全市革命大联合和革命三结合打基础、创条件，这是黄石地区无产阶级革命派全面落实毛主席最新指示的又一个特点。毛主席的最新指示下达后，东风水泥厂、湖北钢厂、大冶铁矿、黄石火力发电厂等工厂、矿山的无产阶级革命派闻风而动，把大家的思想和行动纳入毛主席最新指示的轨道，让大家心往落实毛主席最新指示上想，话往落实毛主席最新指示上讲，步伐往落实毛主席最新指示上迈，以“只争朝夕”的精神，排除干扰，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。他们进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合，很快实现了革命三结合，成为全市最早成立革命委员会的一批企业。
    学先进，找差距，发扬积极因素，坚持不断革命、力争上游的革命精神，这是黄石地区无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示的又一显著特点。在人民解放军的帮助下，黄石地区的无产阶级革命派，看外地，想本地，看外单位，想本单位，看群众，想自己，越看越兴奋，越想干劲越足。一些原来认为自己还不错的单位越来越感到觉悟不如人家高，行动不如人家快。他们奋起直追，群众促头头，头头带群众，迅速落实了毛主席的最新指示。
