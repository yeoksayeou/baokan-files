The report said that on the early morning of that day, the southern military and civilian forces of this province simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the county town of Phu Loc and many enemy strongholds in the areas of Cu Hai, An Phu, Thuan Tru, and No Ne. The artillery units of the Liberation Army also fiercely bombarded the stronghold of the first battalion of the first regiment of the first marine division of the American bandits located four kilometers southwest of the county town of Phu Loc. Meanwhile, the engineering units of the Liberation Army also blew up many bridges in this area. On the same day, the people's armed forces also launched two brilliant ambush battles on the first highway in Phu Loc County, annihilating 12 military vehicles full of American troops.

On January 4, the American invaders dispatched two battalions of the 101st Airborne Division's second brigade, under the cover of armored vehicles and artillery, to sweep through the village of Trung An in Xuyen Moc County, Gia Dinh Province. The people's armed forces, who were well-prepared, fiercely attacked the enemy near Ba Ria Bridge. In a seven-hour fierce battle, the people's armed forces repelled the enemy's five attacks, causing heavy casualties and forcing the enemy to flee in disarray. According to preliminary information, the people's armed forces killed and wounded 280 American invaders.
