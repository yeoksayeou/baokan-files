At three o'clock in the afternoon on January 2nd, the 356th train from Shacheng to Beijing entered Xingjiabu Station.

A soldier had just boarded the train when it started moving. Unfortunately, he missed a step, and his body lurched, falling under the train. The train moved slowly forward. The soldier hurriedly tried to climb up, but his backpack was caught under the train, and he couldn't get up. The station attendant, Gao Xiuying, saw the situation and quickly ran over to pull him up. The train was moving forward, and there was no time to lose. If the train's steps passed by, the soldier would be crushed to death. Stopping the train was out of the question; the steps of the next car were less than five meters away! Gao Xiuying looked at the soldier, and Chairman Mao's words echoed in her ears: "Support the army and love the people!" "Support the army," this is the battle task given to us by Chairman Mao! Gao Xiuying looked at the shining red cap badge and insignia, and suddenly in her mind appeared countless tall figures: Lei Feng, Wang Jie, OuYang Hai, Li Wenzhong...

She leaped down from the platform, using all her strength to push the soldier to safety! Gao Xiuying also fell to the ground, and the train's steps passed by in a flash.

"Woo..." The train, carrying this song of military-civilian friendship, sped along the Fengsha Line.

    丰沙线上救亲人
    元月二日下午三点，由沙城开往北京的第三五六次列车进入邢家堡站。
    一位解放军同志刚登上车梯，列车开动了。不料他一只脚登空，身子猛地一闪，掉在站台下的车底下了。列车徐徐前进。解放军同志急忙往上爬，可是背上的背包挂在车下怎么也上不来。站务员高秀英看到这种情况，急忙跑过来拉他。列车在前进，时间刻不容缓，列车的车门梯子一过来，解放军同志就会被挤死。停车，来不及了，后面的车门梯子距离解放军同志不到五米远了！高秀英同志眼望着解放军同志，毛主席的话响在耳边：“拥军爱民”！“拥军”，是毛主席交给我们的战斗任务！高秀英同志眼望着红光闪闪的帽徽和领章，顿时，在她的眼前浮现出千万个高大形象：雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、李文忠……
    她纵身一跃跳下站台，用平生最大的力气一推，解放军同志得救了！高秀英同志也摔倒了，列车的车门梯子一晃而过。
    “呜……”列车载着这一曲军民友谊歌奔驰在丰沙线上。
