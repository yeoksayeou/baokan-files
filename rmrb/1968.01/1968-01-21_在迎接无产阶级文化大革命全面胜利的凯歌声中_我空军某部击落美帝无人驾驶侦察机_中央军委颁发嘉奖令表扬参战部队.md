In the midst of celebrating the imminent victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force today, in the afternoon, shot down an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into our airspace over a certain location in Yunnan. This is the first American aggressor aircraft shot down by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this year, and the fifteenth American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down since November 1964. This is a resolute punishment for the American imperialists' war provocations and a necessary warning to the American imperialists' attempt to escalate the Vietnam War!

The Central Military Commission today issued an order of commendation, praising the People's Liberation Army Air Force unit that shot down an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over a certain location in Yunnan this afternoon.

The order of commendation states: In the midst of celebrating the imminent victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," and under the correct command of your superiors, shot down an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into the airspace over a certain location in Yunnan to conduct reconnaissance activities. You are hereby commended in an order.

The order of commendation points out: Chairman Mao said, "All reactionary forces are doomed to die. They will inevitably make desperate struggles before their death." The American imperialists, in an attempt to salvage their failure in the Vietnam War, will continue to send aircraft to intrude into our country to provoke war. Our country's airspace will not be allowed to be violated. We hope that you will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, vigorously promote proletarian politics, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight against selfishness" as the key link, seriously summarize experiences, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production and prepare for war." Strive for greater victories in the battles to defend our country's airspace.

    我空军某部击落美帝无人驾驶侦察机
    中央军委颁发嘉奖令表扬参战部队
    新华社二十日讯　在迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的凯歌声中，我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，今天下午，在云南某地上空，一举击落侵入我国领空的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。这是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，今年击落的第一架美国强盗飞机，也是从一九六四年十一月以来击落的第十五架美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机。这是对于美帝国主义的战争挑衅的坚决惩罚，也是对于美帝企图扩大侵越战争的必要警告！
    新华社二十日讯　中央军委今天颁发嘉奖令，表扬今天在云南某地上空一举击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架的中国人民解放军空军某部。
    嘉奖令说，在迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的凯歌声中，你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的教导，在上级正确指挥下，一举击落侵入我云南某地上空进行侦察活动的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架，特予通令嘉奖。
    嘉奖令指出，毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”美帝国主义妄图挽救它在侵越战争中的失败，今后还会继续派遣飞机侵入我国进行战争挑衅。祖国的领空，决不容许侵犯。希望你们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真总结经验，坚决贯彻毛主席关于抓革命，促战备的伟大方针，在保卫祖国领空的作战中争取更大的胜利。
