The Chinese People's Republic's Red East Acrobatic Troupe, which had visited Japan for performances, received a warm welcome from the Japanese people. Wherever they went, they witnessed with their own eyes the Japanese people's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

One morning, three Japanese young women came to the residence of the Chinese performers and enthusiastically handed them a small paper package. The performers opened the package and were moved to tightly grasp the hands of the three young women, expressing their gratitude.

Inside the package were seven red badges made of gold thread. Each badge had the words "Long Live Chairman Mao!" neatly embroidered in gold. Every stitch and thread was soaked with the Japanese people's boundless love for Chairman Mao.

These seven badges were embroidered by a 17-year-old high school student from Kyoto, Kondo Shinshi.

Kondo Shinshi, following Chairman Mao's instruction that revolutionary youth must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, had gone to the countryside during the summer vacation to participate in production labor and transform her thoughts. Through labor, she further understood that Chairman Mao's teachings are a great truth. In her interactions with the acrobatic troupe's performers, she felt even more that the Red Guards nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought were her role models, and that the beloved Chairman Mao was the red sun in the hearts of the Japanese revolutionary people. To express her boundless admiration for the great leader, she stayed up all night embroidering these seven badges with meticulous care as the acrobatic troupe was about to leave Kyoto.

Kondo Shinshi told a Chinese reporter: "These small seven badges, though they express my intentions, cannot fully express the Japanese people's boundless respect and love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao."

Becoming Chairman Mao's Red Guards

During the Red East Acrobatic Troupe's performance in Kyoto, a tall Japanese youth raised his arm and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" This youth was Inoue Shojiro, who last year on May Day, led the parade of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Kyoto headquarters, wearing a "Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought" armband.

Inoue is a young pioneer of the anti-Kyobun group. He told the Chinese performers, "This social system in Japan must be smashed! We must reform the world according to Mao Zedong Thought." When the Chinese performers studied Chairman Mao's quotations with him, they accidentally opened his "Quotations from Chairman Mao," seeing that he had written neatly: "Follow the teachings of Comrade Lin Biao, study Chairman Mao's works, study with questions in mind, apply actively, learn what is urgently needed, and see immediate results."

The performers expressed to Inoue, "We should learn from our Japanese friends." At this moment, Inoue was very excited, with tears in his eyes, saying, "No, I should learn from the Chinese Red Guards, become the Red Guards of the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Two Hundred Forty Red Flags

Once, after the Red East Acrobatic Troupe's performance at the Kobe Central Gymnasium, the performers on stage and the audience below waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" At this moving moment, more than eighty students marched onto the stage and presented one red flag after another to the performers.

These golden-red flags had the words: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Long Live Great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long Live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

There were a total of 240 such flags. These red flags were jointly made by the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Hyogo Prefecture headquarters, the Kobe branch of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Kobe Chinese Overseas Chinese Association. They hoped that the acrobatic troupe would take these red flags back to the center of the world revolution—Beijing, expressing the Japanese people's respect for the great leader Chairman Mao, their boundless faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and their deep affection for the Chinese people.

    仰望北斗星  心向毛泽东
    ——中国东方红杂技团访日演出时遇到的动人事例
    曾在日本访问演出的中华人民共和国东方红杂技团，受到了日本人民的热烈欢迎。他们所到之处，亲眼看到了日本人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。千针万线一颗红心
    一天清早，就有三位日本女青年到中国演员的住处热情地把一个小纸包送给了演员。演员们拆开纸包一看，激动地紧紧握住这三位女青年的手，不住地道谢。
    原来，这纸包里是七块用金丝绒线绣成的红彤彤的胸章。每一块胸章上都端端正正地绣着“毛主席万岁！”五个大字，字字闪金光。每一针每一线都浸透着日本人民对毛主席的无限热爱。
    这七块胸章是京都一位十七岁的高中女学生近藤伸子绣的。
    近藤伸子根据毛主席指出的革命青年必须实行和广大的工农群众结合的教导，在暑假期间曾经到农村去参加生产劳动，改造思想，她经过劳动，进一步体会到毛主席的教导是伟大的真理。她在同杂技团演员的接触中，越发感到用毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的毛主席的红卫兵是自己的榜样，敬爱的毛主席是日本革命人民心中的红太阳。为了表示她对伟大领袖的无限敬仰，她在杂技团演员即将离开京都时，整个一宵没有睡觉，连夜一针一线地精心绣出了七块胸章。
    近藤伸子对中国记者说：“这小小的七块胸章，虽然表达了自己的心意，但是千针万线也表达不尽日本人民对世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的无比崇敬和无比热爱。”做毛主席的红卫兵
    东方红杂技团在京都演出时，一个身材魁伟的日本青年，在演出结束时振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”这个青年，就是在去年“五一”国际劳动节走在日中友协（正统）京都总部游行队伍最前面、带着“毛泽东思想红卫兵”袖章的井上庄治郎。
    井上是大造宫本集团的反的一名青年闯将。他对中国演员说：“日本这个社会制度，一定要砸烂！必须按照毛泽东思想来改造这个世界。”中国演员在和他一起学习毛主席语录的时候，偶然翻开他的《毛主席语录》，看到他在宝书上端端正正地写着：“要遵循林彪同志的教导，学习毛主席著作，带着问题学，活学活用，急用先学，立竿见影。”
    演员们向井上表示：“我们要向日本朋友学习。”这时，井上非常激动，含着热泪说：“不，我应该向中国的红卫兵学习，做伟大领袖毛主席的红卫兵！”二百四十面红旗
    有一次，东方红杂技团在神户中央体育馆演出结束的时候，台上演员和台下观众一齐挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”就在这激动人心的时刻，有八十多名小学生列队走上舞台，他们把一面又一面的金字红旗赠给了演员。
    这些金光闪烁的红旗上印着：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    这样的旗帜，一共有二百四十面。这些红旗是日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部、日本国际贸易促进协会神户支局和神户华侨联谊会共同制作的。他们希望杂技团把这些红旗带回世界革命的中心——北京，表达日本人民对伟大领袖毛主席的敬意，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰，对中国人民的深厚情谊。
