The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburban people's communes of Shanghai, in the midst of a great revolutionary and production upsurge, have sold cotton to the state with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. By the end of last December, the suburbs had overfulfilled by one thousand piculs the state's cotton procurement plan for 1967.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs had fought shoulder to shoulder with the Shanghai proletariat. They resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and last year won double victories in both revolution and production. They held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticized the revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchov and his agents in Shanghai in the countryside; at the same time, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, they launched a new high tide in agricultural production. Cotton preparation, sowing, and field management were all closely linked, and farm work was done with meticulous care. During the cotton bolling period last year, the suburbs encountered a drought rarely seen in many years. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with a heroic spirit of man conquering nature, waged a tenacious struggle against the drought and finally won a bumper cotton harvest.

    高高兴兴庆丰收　满腔热情售新棉
    上海郊区超额完成国家棉花收购计划
    据新华社上海九日电　上海市郊区农村人民公社广大贫下中农，在革命和生产一派大好形势下，以空前高涨的革命热情，积极向国家交售棉花。到去年十二月底，郊区超额一千担完成了一九六七年度国家棉花收购计划。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中曾经和上海工人阶级并肩战斗的郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，去年取得了革命和生产的双胜利。他们高举革命的批判旗帜，深入批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人对农村散布的修正主义谬论；同时以冲天的革命干劲，掀起了农业生产的新高潮。棉花的备耕、播种和田间管理都环环扣紧，农活精益求精。在去年棉花结桃期间，郊区遇到了多年罕见的干旱，广大贫下中农以人定胜天的英雄气概，同干旱进行了顽强的斗争，终于夺得了棉花的大丰收。
