The great teacher of ours, Chairman Mao, issued the "Talk on Supporting the Just Patriotic Struggle of the Panamanian People Against American Imperialism" four years ago. This brilliant historical document, like a lighthouse shining brightly, illuminated the revolutionary path for the people of the world, pointed out the direction for the united struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and inspired the revolutionary will of the people of the world, greatly dampening the arrogance of imperialism led by the United States.

In order to implement its counter-revolutionary global strategy and realize its ambition to dominate the world, American imperialism, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, has been extending its claws of aggression further and further. It not only rules and dominates in Panama, not only rules and dominates in Latin America, but also runs rampant all over the world. As Chairman Mao pointed out in his talk: "American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world."

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The aggressive activities of American imperialism in enslaving the people of various countries and attempting to dominate the world cannot but force the people of various countries to rise up and attack it. All the countries and peoples of the world who are oppressed, invaded, interfered with, and bullied by it will not let it off!

In this brilliant document, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The tide of the people of the world against the American aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism and its running dogs will certainly achieve even greater victories." The past four years have proven that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment is completely correct.

The people of the world are carrying out revolution and struggle according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao in this talk. The heroic Vietnamese people, relying on their own strength, are waging a people's war, making the most vicious American imperialism in the world fall into a desperate and dismal situation, setting a brilliant example for the anti-American struggle of the people of the world. The revolutionary people of many Asian countries such as Laos, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia are following Chairman Mao's great teachings of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force, insisting on the path of armed struggle, and becoming stronger and stronger in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs. On the African continent, the waves of national liberation movements are surging, and armed struggles are blazing everywhere. In the "backyard" of the United States, Latin America, from the dictatorial rule of Brazil to the so-called "democratic" window of Chile, from Ecuador on the Pacific coast to the Dominican Republic on the Caribbean Sea, powerful anti-American storms are constantly rising. Even within the United States, the flames of armed resistance by blacks are burning more and more fiercely. American imperialism has fallen into the encirclement of the people of the world, and the noose around its neck is being tightened more and more, making its days worse and worse. This is exactly as Chairman Mao said four years ago: "American imperialism is rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with the people of the world, making itself more and more isolated."

In the talk, Chairman Mao called on the people of the world to unite, for all countries and peoples invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied by the United States to unite, and form the broadest anti-American united front. In the past four years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the world have become more closely united, and the broadest anti-American united front is taking shape, with the tide of anti-American struggle rising higher and higher. For this reason, the running dogs of American imperialism and all traitors to the revolution keep jumping out to make trouble and sabotage this anti-American united front. In this regard, the greatest traitor to the people of the world and the number one accomplice of American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, is particularly active. On the one hand, it paints American imperialism with lipstick, trying to lull the people of various countries; on the other hand, it colludes with American imperialism to launch a frenzied anti-China reverse current, maliciously strangling the national liberation movements of various countries. The Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique has gone even further in betraying the revolutionary interests of the people of the world and currying favor with American imperialism. In Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist clique actively helps American imperialism peddle the "peace talks" fraud, trying to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle. In the Middle East incident, the Soviet revisionist clique completely stood on the side of American imperialism, supporting American imperialism and its invasion tool Israel in their aggression against Arab countries, betraying the interests of the Arab people. This completely exposes its counter-revolutionary face! Today, the revolutionary people of the world are increasingly aware that anti-imperialism must also mean anti-revisionism, and only by resolutely opposing Soviet modern revisionism can the anti-American struggle be carried through to the end!

The seemingly powerful American imperialism is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in their hands cannot frighten the revolutionary people of the world, nor can they save their own lives! The great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle have already eloquently proven this. The great victories of the anti-American struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also eloquently proven this. However, the American imperialists are still alive, and their desperate struggles not only show their weakness but also indicate that they still have the ability to make trouble. We must always be on guard and must treat this paper tiger as an iron tiger! As long as the revolutionary people of the world are guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen unity, and strengthen struggle, they will certainly be able to bury American imperialism completely and certainly be able to create a bright red new world!

### 反美怒潮不可阻挡

    反美怒潮不可阻挡
    人民解放军某部  郝晋文　陈健民
    我们的伟大导师毛主席在四年前发表了《支持巴拿马人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》。这篇光辉的历史文献，象光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了全世界人民革命的道路，指明了全世界人民团结起来，反对美帝国主义的斗争方向，鼓舞着全世界人民的革命斗争意志，大灭了以美国为首的帝国主义的威风。
    美帝国主义为了推行它的反革命全球战略，实现它独霸世界的野心，不顾世界人民的反对，把侵略的魔爪越伸越长。它不仅在巴拿马称王称霸，不仅在拉丁美洲称王称霸，而且在世界各地横行霸道。正如毛主席在谈话中指出的：“美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。”
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。美帝国主义奴役世界各国人民，企图称霸全世界的侵略活动，不能不迫使世界各国人民群起而攻之。全世界一切受它压迫、受它侵略、受它干涉和欺负的国家和人民决不会饶了它的！
    毛主席在这篇光辉的文献中指出：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”四年来的事实证明，毛主席的这个光辉论断是完全正确的。
    全世界人民正在按照毛主席在这篇谈话中所指引的方向进行革命，进行斗争。英雄的越南人民依靠自己的力量，进行人民战争，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，为全世界人民的反美斗争树立了一个光辉的榜样。老挝、缅甸、菲律宾、泰国、印尼等许多亚洲国家的革命人民，按照毛主席的农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的伟大教导，坚持走武装斗争的道路，在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，越战越强。非洲大陆上，民族解放运动波涛汹涌，到处燃起了武装斗争的烽火。在美国的“后院”拉丁美洲，从独裁统治的巴西到所谓
  “代议制民主”橱窗的智利，从太平洋岸的厄瓜多尔到加勒比海的多米尼加，不断掀起强大的反美风暴。甚至在美国国内，黑人武装抗暴斗争的烈火也越烧越旺。美帝国主义陷入了全世界人民的重重包围之中，在它脖子上的绞索越拉越紧，它的日子越来越不好过了。这完全象毛主席四年前所说的：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”
    毛主席在谈话中号召全世界人民要联合起来，所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家要联合起来，结成最广泛的反美统一战线。四年来，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，全世界革命人民团结得更加紧密，最广泛的反美统一战线正在形成，反美斗争的浪潮日益高涨。正因为如此，那些美帝国主义的走狗和一切革命的叛徒，不断地跳出来捣乱，破坏这个反美统一战线。在这方面，世界人民的最大叛徒、美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏修集团尤其卖力。它一面给美帝国主义涂脂抹粉，竭力麻痹各国人民；一面又伙同美帝国主义掀起疯狂的反华逆流，恶毒地扼杀世界各国民族解放运动。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团，变本加厉地出卖世界人民的革命利益，投靠美帝国主义。在越南，苏修集团帮助美帝国主义积极推销“和谈”骗局，妄想扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。在中东事件中，苏修集团完全站在美帝国主义的立场上，支持美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略，出卖阿拉伯国家人民的利益。这完全暴露了它的反革命嘴脸！今天，全世界革命人民越来越认识到，反帝必须反修，只有坚决反对苏联现代修正主义，才能把反美斗争进行到底！
    貌似强大的美帝国主义是个外强中干的纸老虎。它们手中的原子弹、氢弹吓不倒世界革命人民，救不了它自己的命！越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利已经雄辩地证明了这一点。亚非拉各国人民反美斗争的伟大胜利也雄辩地证明了这一点。但是，美帝国主义者目前还活着，它的垂死挣扎不仅表现了它的虚弱，而且也表明了它还有力量捣乱。我们一定要随时提高警惕，一定要把这只纸老虎当铁老虎打！全世界革命人民，只要在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，加强团结，加强斗争，就一定能够把美帝国主义彻底埋葬，就一定能够打出一个红彤彤的新世界！
