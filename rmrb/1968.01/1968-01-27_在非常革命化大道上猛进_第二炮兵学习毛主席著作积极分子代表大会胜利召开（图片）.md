In the spirit of revolution, the Second Artillery Force is making great strides. The conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works was successfully held.

With hearts aflame, thousands of soldiers and officers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Second Artillery Force, filled with profound class sentiments, stitched together a banner reading "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever" with needles and threads. They presented this banner to their beloved red sun, Chairman Mao.

Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have hearts as red as fire and wills as firm as steel. A tough soldier from a certain unit, Qu Junshen, was critically injured in the line of duty. In his final moments, his thoughts were only of the great leader Chairman Mao and his teachings. During his hospitalization, he actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding criticism sessions in the ward with revolutionary young people, fiercely denouncing China's Khrushchev.

This is Comrade Qu Junshen studying Chairman Mao's works in the hospital. Supplied by the Political Department of the Second Artillery Force.

Known as a "White-seeking En" doctor by the soldiers and local residents, a certain unit's military doctor, Gong Picheng, firmly carried out the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, using the "Three Articles" as his guiding principles. He strived to change his worldview and serve the people wholeheartedly. This is him sharing his experiences of deeply entering the units to do a good job in disease prevention and health work with the medical staff of a certain hospital.

With the red sun rising in their hearts, their spirits are vibrant and fiery. The kitchen brigade of a certain unit's Second Platoon holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, cooking for the revolution. While at the stove, they keep an eye on the world, stay alert to enemy movements, strengthen war preparedness, and serve the troops wholeheartedly. They are not only cooks and fighters but also propagandists, often spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction site.

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Representatives of the Second Artillery Force's conference on active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works gathered to discuss their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said: "Among thousands of books, Chairman Mao's works are the treasure; among thousands of principles, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are all great truths; among thousands of important matters, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments is the most important; among thousands of tasks, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest task."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings that the People's Liberation Army is both a fighting force and a production and work force, a certain unit's Seventh Platoon held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in their garrison, widely propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and extensively studying, reciting, and applying the "Three Articles." They transformed the remote "Nest of Mud" into a "Red Flag Village" where the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought flies high. This is the Seventh Platoon's representative visiting the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Beijing's Chongwen District, China Strong Hutong, to learn from the residents' good experiences in running the study class.

Diligently studying the "Three Articles," willing to be a servant of the people for life. The commander of a certain unit's feeding class, Zhang Sanhuai, is loyal to Chairman Mao, diligently following Chairman Mao's instructions, working tirelessly and diligently for twenty years without complaint. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he followed the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployments, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. This is him sharing his experiences in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with his fellow soldiers in the feeding class.

Revolutionary soldiers and Red Guards have hearts connected. The commander of a certain unit's platoon, Zhang Mingjiu, in the face of an impending accident, with profound class sentiments for Chairman Mao, rushed forward without hesitation, using his body to protect Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. This is Zhang Mingjiu and active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works, Zhang Jiaqing, having a friendly conversation with the Red Guards in the capital.
