Chairman Mao has instructed: "Our comrades, no matter where they go, must get along well with the masses, care for them, and help them solve their difficulties." The medical officer of a certain air force unit stationed in the Tibetan Plateau, Song Xianben, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, follows Chairman Mao's teachings and goes deep into the pastoral areas to treat Tibetan compatriots. As soon as he arrives in the pastoral areas, he presents the portrait of the red sun in the hearts of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's quotations to the Tibetan compatriots, which is warmly welcomed by the masses.

Chairman Mao has instructed: "Support the army and love the people." Soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chairman Mao's hometown to support the left, met with the great communist warrior Yang Yanghai's father, Yang Hengwen, and the platoon leader of Yang Yanghai's unit, Yang Hu, in Shaoshan. The soldiers expressed to Old Man Yang Hengwen: We will take Yang Yanghai as our example. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight!

Chairman Mao has instructed: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle." Helping the masses to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arming the broad revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is the greatest way to love the people. The support-left personnel of the 4640 unit enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," helping local areas to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly implemented, item by item, and comprehensively. This is the support-left personnel and revolutionary masses criticizing and repudiating their selfishness together.

Chairman Mao has instructed: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." In the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui, a propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army 6408 unit, which is on a support-left mission, is propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses.

Chairman Mao has instructed: "Without the correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." Political leadership must start from promoting the ideological revolutionization of people to do a good job in production, which is an important task for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers of the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" study Chairman Mao's quotations together with revolutionary workers while performing their support-left duties in a cotton textile printing and dyeing factory in Jiangxi.

Chairman Mao has instructed: "Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." The great People's Liberation Army of China, created and led by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is our model to learn from. The "1124 Hero Collective" is a heroic collective nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary students of the Anshan Red Revolutionary Committee are determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the "1124 Hero Collective," to do a good job in revolutionary great unity and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units.

Chairman Mao has instructed: The unity of the army and the people is like one, see who can defeat us? A certain border defense unit and the local militia firmly carry out the great commander Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness," heighten their vigilance, strengthen preparedness, consolidate national defense, be ready at any time to annihilate the invading enemy, defend the great socialist motherland, and defend the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Zhou Shuhuan

Chairman Mao has instructed: "The army must blend with the masses, making the army appear to the masses as their own army, and this army will be invincible in the world." A certain unit of the PLA stationed in Xuanhua is to build a paper mill for printing Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers of the Xuanhua Paper Mill enthusiastically help the unit build the factory, making this military factory designed, constructed, and put into production in the same year, providing a large amount of paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. This is a triumphant song of supporting the army and loving the people! The picture shows the revolutionary workers of the machine repair workshop helping the unit's factory to machine parts.

Chairman Mao has instructed: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." The support-left personnel of the PLA help several revolutionary mass organizations in a certain machinery factory in Shenyang to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, and conducting in-depth, detailed, and patient ideological and political work, achieving revolutionary great unity in this factory. This is the workers from the two original revolutionary mass organizations, together with the PLA support-left personnel, discussing the immense power of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great significance of revolutionary great unity.
