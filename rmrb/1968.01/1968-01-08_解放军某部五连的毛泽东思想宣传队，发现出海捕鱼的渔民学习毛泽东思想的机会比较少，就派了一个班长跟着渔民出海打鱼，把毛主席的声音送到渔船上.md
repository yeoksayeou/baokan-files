A platoon from a certain unit of the PLA's Fifth Company Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, while supporting agriculture in a certain brigade in Guangdong, discovered that the fishermen who go out to sea to catch fish have fewer opportunities to study Mao Zedong Thought and rarely participate in the revolutionary criticism. Therefore, the propaganda team sent Platoon Leader Jiang Jiewen to the fishing boats to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and help the fishermen carry out revolutionary criticism on the boats.

The next day, Jiang Jiewen went out to sea with the fishermen to catch fish. On the fishing boat, he participated in the labor while reading Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the fishermen and explaining the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the significance of carrying out revolutionary criticism. Chairman Mao's words were like a guiding light, illuminating the hearts of the fishermen and greatly arousing their political enthusiasm.

That night, seven fishing boats anchored together, and the fishermen gathered on one boat, lit a fishing fire, and for the first time set up a revolutionary criticism battlefield on the boat. Platoon Leader Jiang Jiewen led everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations and angrily denounced China's Khrushchev for advocating "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to restore capitalism. Jiang Jiewen's speech aroused the class hatred of the fishermen. A 60-year-old old fisherman, Chen Dalin, stood up and said angrily, "The 'freedom' that China's Khrushchev advocates is the 'freedom' for the landlords and fishing tyrants to oppress us fishermen again. We must criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, the big backer of the landlords and fishing tyrants, and we must forever follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road!"

As soon as the old fisherman's words fell, a nearby team member, Zhang Ayi, angrily continued, "China's Khrushchev is truly poisonous! He says that the 'free market should still be carried out' and 'the emergence of new capitalism is not to be feared,' which is to incite speculators to engage in speculative trading, disrupt the collective economy, and undermine the foundations of socialism. In the past, I almost went astray. Now I understand that China's Khrushchev's 'three freedoms and one contract' is poison wrapped in sugar, not a bit of it can be tasted. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison he spread and be good fishermen who are devoted to the collective and the public!" Thus, one speech followed another, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.

Since then, these few fishing boats, although they go out to sea to catch fish every day, often study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and hold a struggle-session-criticize-revisionism meeting every week, making the atmosphere very lively.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the PLA Navy went deep into the coastal fishing grounds and fishing villages, propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the fishermen, and singing praises of the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    解放军某部五连的毛泽东思想宣传队，发现出海捕鱼的渔民学习毛泽东思想的机会比较少，就派了一个班长跟着渔民出海打鱼，
    把毛主席的声音送到渔船上
    解放军某部五连毛泽东思想宣传队，在广东某地的翻身大队支农。他们发现队里出海打鱼的渔民，学习毛泽东思想的机会比较少，也很少能够参加革命大批判。于是，宣传队就派了班长蒋节文，到渔船上去宣传毛泽东思想，帮助渔民在船上开展革命的大批判。
    第二天，蒋节文就跟着渔民出海去打鱼。在渔船上，他一面参加劳动，一面给渔民读毛主席的最新指示，向渔民大讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，和开展革命大批判的意义。毛主席的话象一盏指路明灯，照亮了渔民们的心，极大地激发了他们的政治热情。
    当天晚上，七条渔船停泊在一块，渔民们集中在一条船上，点起渔火，第一次在船上摆开了革命大批判的战场。班长蒋节文领着大家学习了毛主席语录，愤怒地声讨了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”“四大自由”，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。蒋节文的发言激发了渔民们的阶级仇恨。六十多岁的老渔民陈大林气呼呼地站起来说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的这个‘自由’，就是让地主渔霸再来欺压我们渔民的‘自由’。我们一定要把地主渔霸的大靠山中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，我们一定永远跟毛主席走社会主义的阳关大道！”
    老渔民的话音刚落，旁边的一个社员张阿娣气愤地接上说：“中国赫鲁晓夫真是毒透毒透！他胡说什么‘自由市场还是要搞下去的’，‘产生新的资本主义也不可怕’，就是怂恿投机倒把分子大搞投机买卖，破坏集体经济，挖社会主义墙脚。过去，我也差点走到邪道上去。现在我明白啦，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的‘三自一包’是白糖包着的砒霜，半点也尝不得。我们一定要把他散布的流毒彻底肃清，做一心为集体、一心为公的好渔民！”就这样，发言一个接着一个，情绪十分热烈。
    打这以后，这几条渔船尽管天天出海打鱼，但是经常学习毛主席的最新指示，每星期都召开斗私批修会，搞得热气腾腾。
