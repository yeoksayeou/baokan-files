The world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a year of comprehensive victory. In the past year, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have brought about a fundamental change in the souls of Shanghai's ten million people.

The bell of the East Is Red on the customs house by the Huangpu River welcomes the dawn of Shanghai Port. In the barracks of the army, on the airfields and warships, in the workshops of factories, in the classrooms of schools, and in the fields of people's communes, workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards all face the most red sun in their hearts, first of all, they salute the great leader Chairman Mao with long life! Then they recite "The Three Articles" in unison.

We see that on public buses and trams, people are engaged in heated debates about how to liberate cadres, discussing how to be a good Party member according to Chairman Mao's standards...

On the threshing ground of the people's commune, a sixty or seventy-year-old old man wearing glasses is reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with his little grandson, one word at a time.

On the sea and in the air, our unparalleled People's Liberation Army is using Chairman Mao's quotations to command patrols, training, and combat readiness.

In the alleys, we see that the old mothers who used to only care about the stove under their noses and the basket in their hands are now criticizing the revisionist line of building the Party with their daughters and grandchildren.

Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are being grasped by millions of people, and the great Mao Zedong Thought is becoming the soul of the people.

In the proletarian dictatorship, continue the revolution

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism."

In the proletarian dictatorship, we must continue the revolution, rebel against the capitalist reactionary line, rebel against the capitalist roaders within the proletarian dictatorship organs, rebel against all exploitative class ideologies, and rebel against the "self" in our minds. This is the brilliant thought of the great leader Chairman Mao to arm the seven hundred million people to thoroughly blow up the old world.

The proletarian revolutionary forces in Shanghai, with the working class as the main force, are directly commanded by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, using this invincible brilliant thought to charge into the enemy's ranks, sweeping all before them.

The birth, growth, and development of the unified fighting organization of Shanghai workers—the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters—is the most vivid example. Wang Xiuzhen, one of the leaders of the "Workers' General Headquarters," and her comrades-in-arms have experienced this battle.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wang Xiuzhen, a textile worker from the No. 30 Cotton Mill, responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to arms and actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She posted a famous big-character poster throughout the factory, exposing the class struggle within the factory Party committee. However, she was immediately labeled as a member of the "Petofi Club." The work team sent by the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee threatened her: "Do you still listen to the Party? Do you still want your Party membership?" Wang Xiuzhen engaged in a fierce struggle within herself. She looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and read his teachings over and over again: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, ... at all times and in all places, adhere to correct principles, and tirelessly struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors." Chairman Mao's teachings, like the morning sun, dispelled the fog in her mind: This is the time for a true Communist Party member to tirelessly struggle to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! As the Cultural Revolution leader of the factory, Wang Xiuzhen went to the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to report on the work team.

She met Wang Hongwen, the current main leader of the "Workers' General Headquarters." Wang Hongwen had been to Beijing and, together with the Red Guards, received the inspection of our great leader Chairman Mao. He saw Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and heard the voice of the great leader. He told Wang Xiuzhen: "Chairman Mao said that from the central to the local levels, there are people standing on the capitalist reactionary position to suppress the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao said that rebellion is justified. Chairman Mao enthusiastically supports us to rebel and revolt!"

Chairman Mao said: "Rebellion is justified." This voice was like a spring thunder, like a thousand flashes of lightning in the sky, illuminating the path forward for the ordinary worker and excellent Communist Party member Wang Xiuzhen. She suddenly saw clearly that what lay before her was a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines! Going to the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to "report" was out of the question! They were all of the same ilk! Relying on one person and one factory was also out of the question! She had to spread Chairman Mao's voice of "rebellion is justified" among the workers and organize millions of revolutionary workers to rebel!

"Rebellion is justified!" On November 9, 1966, the "Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" was established. The main force of the Cultural Revolution took the stage, and the political balance of power in Shanghai immediately changed. Wang Xiuzhen participated in the founding meeting of the "Workers' General Headquarters."

From then on, Wang Xiuzhen, together with the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, the revolutionary Red Guards, and the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sang the battle song "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," breaking through the white terror created by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, launching fierce attacks on the capitalist reactionary line at Anting, at the Liberation Daily, at Kangping Road...

Wang Xiuzhen, together with the millions of revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sang the battle song of "rebellion is justified," and launched a nationwide storm of the "January Revolution," sounding the charge to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party!

Wang Xiuzhen, together with the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, raised the great banner of "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," sang the battle song of "rebellion is justified," fired at the "self" in their minds, and completely broke with traditional concepts, thoroughly uprooting the roots of revisionism!

Wang Xiuzhen will never forget: On the evening of May 1, the previous year, on Tiananmen Gate, she, with the hearts of two million workers in Shanghai, saw the most red sun in her heart, Chairman Mao. Wang Xiuzhen held Chairman Mao's hand tightly, looking at Chairman Mao's affectionate smile, turning thousands of words into one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" This sentence is the most important one. It expresses the heartfelt wishes of two million workers in Shanghai and the common aspirations of all revolutionary people in China and the world! Wang Xiuzhen hurriedly took out the "January Revolution" commemorative badge from her pocket and personally presented it to the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao walked away to meet other guests, and Wang Xiuzhen followed Chairman Mao closely, enthusiastically shouting: "Follow Chairman Mao! Follow Chairman Mao!"

Follow the great leader Chairman Mao! This is the oath of the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai workers, the oath of ten million people in Shanghai! They are determined to be forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Wherever the bourgeoisie tries to restore power, they will be overthrown there! Wherever revisionism appears, it will be overthrown there!

In the light of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "liberating all mankind," the souls of the proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai have undergone profound changes and reached a new realm. They have progressed from seeking their own liberation to seeking the liberation of the class and the liberation of all mankind, step by step climbing the peak of the communist worldview.

After the proletarian revolutionaries of the Hudong Shipyard by the Huangpu River took power, due to the interference of factionalism, the two revolutionary mass organizations fought each other for five months, losing sight of the direction of the struggle. They had several negotiations, each blaming the other, and ended up not agreeing.

From Beijing came Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the proletarian dictatorship, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team organized the leaders of the two factions to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A leader of a larger organization, Qian Aochuan, faced the red Mao Zedong Thought books, his heart surging with emotion. He thought: Chairman Mao calls on us to liberate all mankind, but I only see a small hill. Chairman Mao asks us to make more self-criticisms, but I only use a magnifying glass to look at the shortcomings of others. The more he thought, the more he felt he had let down Chairman Mao's teachings; the more he thought, the more he felt his factionalism was serious, and he was unworthy of Chairman Mao. He excitedly told the leader of the smaller organization, Xiao Songbo: "I have always considered ourselves the big hill and wanted to swallow your small hill. The biggest mistake is to treat class brothers as enemies! Objectively, we have helped the enemy!" Xiao Songbo also made a soul-searching self-examination. He said: "We are unique in our leftism and revolution, thinking that only we are revolutionary and everyone else is not. We should no longer cling to our small group, forgetting the seven hundred million people and the billions of people in the world, forgetting the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!" The leaders of the two factions learned more and saw more clearly. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionaries of the entire factory united.

The Anting area, where the "Anting Incident" occurred, was once a place of fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Shanghai. Now it has become a red Mao Zedong Thought school. From the changes in Shanghai Automated Instruments Factory No. 9 in the Anting area, we see how Chairman Mao's thought of "liberating all mankind" sprouts, takes root, blooms, and bears fruit in the hearts of ordinary workers.

The leader of the rebel team in this factory, Zhang Zhenfang, had a knot in his mind after taking power. He thought: In the past, someone attacked us rebels, and today we should also make them suffer. Under such thoughts, the masses could not unite, the revolution could not be carried out, and production could not be improved. He was also very troubled and wanted to give up power twice. Just at this critical moment, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: "We must strive to unite all those who can be united," "carry out heart-to-heart talks." Chairman Mao's words struck Zhang Zhenfang's heartstrings. He thought: Why can't I unite the majority of revolutionary masses to revolt together? It is the "self" that creates a chasm between me and the masses, and the "self" that makes me lose sight of the direction of the struggle. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When lost, think of your teachings and the direction will be clear. To seek liberation for all mankind is the bosom of the proletarian revolutionaries.

Zhang Zhenfang freed himself from the "self," saw the broad masses, and added boundless strength to his body. He actively sought out Wang Lianqun, who had been criticized by him, for a heart-to-heart talk. He said: "In the past, you attacked us, and that was because you were deceived by the capitalist reactionary line. I turned around and opposed you, which was wrong. We are bitter gourds on the same vine, and this account should be settled with China's Khrushchev." Wang Lianqun was deeply moved and wrote an enthusiastic public letter to the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory, attaching two shining "Five Good Workers" commemorative badges that had been pressed under her pillow. She said: "I am not worthy of wearing these two badges now. I will take you as an example and the revolutionary rebels as an example, truly rise up in revolution, and strive to be a good worker of Chairman Mao." The People's Liberation Army, at the factory-wide mass meeting, pinned the two "Five Good Workers" commemorative badges on Wang Lianqun's chest, encouraging her to be a revolutionary soldier of Chairman Mao. The revolutionary rebel team gave her a red "Rebel Team" armband.

In Shanghai, there are many old soldiers who experienced southward and northward battles in the years of war and fire. After entering the city, they relaxed their self-transformation of worldview, were poisoned and deceived by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, and carried out the capitalist reactionary line in the Cultural Revolution, suffering fierce attacks from the revolutionary mass movement. After being baptized by the storm of mass struggle, they washed off the political dust on their bodies, regained their revolutionary youth, and stood up again with the revolutionary vigor of the past, appearing in the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary army with a new fighting posture.

Zhang Jingbiao, the original first secretary of the Yangpu District Committee and now the responsible person of the Yangpu District Revolutionary Committee, is one of these old soldiers. The revolutionary masses rose up to criticize his mistakes, and his mood was very antagonistic.

The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai launched one wave after another of great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pisha and Cao Qiqiu, exposing the thrilling struggle between the two classes of restoration and anti-restoration, making Zhang Jingbiao awaken. The serious criticism of the revolutionary masses, the patient help of the Red Guards, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions made him begin to correctly treat the masses, correctly treat himself, and bravely stand up to revolt. Chairman Mao said: "Old cadres have merits in the past, but they cannot rely on past merits. They must be well tempered and transformed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to establish new merits and new labor." Zhang Jingbiao studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again, the more he studied, the more excited he felt. He thought, Chairman Mao cares for and loves us old soldiers so much, and I have indeed let down Chairman Mao's expectations. The more he thought, the heavier his heart became, but he went to the other extreme, completely denying himself. Therefore, he only "sought liberation but not combination," "sought general combination but did not want to be the first in command." The Red Guards recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations to him: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade." They also studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him: "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." Chairman Mao's latest instructions once again shook Zhang Jingbiao's soul. He thought, to break selfishness, one must break it at the root; now the root of my "self" is that I do not want to bear the revolutionary burden again; to establish the public, one must establish it at the root; the root of the "public" is to take revolutionary interests as the first life, to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

The light of Mao Zedong Thought once again illuminated Zhang Jingbiao's path forward. At the mass meeting announcing the combination of Zhang Jingbiao as the first in command, Zhang Jingbiao could not help but shed tears. He stood on the stage for a long time and finally said: "Even if I am crushed to pieces, I will follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end!"

In more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, not only were a large number of revolutionary leading cadres saved and educated, but we also excitedly saw that many ordinary workers in Shanghai were tempered and grown into reliable revolutionary successors in the great waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Hu Hanchang, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, was the first batch of rebels in the factory and the first to post a big-character poster for great unity. When promoting the realization of great unity in the entire factory, he did not compete for personal positions and actively ensured that the other side's committee members were elected. After being elected again as a member of the factory Revolutionary Committee and deputy head of the workshop Revolutionary Committee by the masses, he always maintained the character of an ordinary soldier. He received an invitation to the National Day banquet from the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and tickets to attend the National Day celebration, but he thought that the honor should belong to the revolutionary masses. Many old craftsmen in the factory studied Chairman Mao's works well, and they should participate in the banquet and the first National Day celebration after the revolutionary faction took power. He gave the invitations and celebration tickets to two old workers and stayed in the factory on duty. What kind of style is this? This is the style of the proletarian revolutionaries who serve the people wholeheartedly, who do not seek personal gain, do not seek fame, work hard, and always keep their hearts connected with the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

A group of revolutionary young people from Tongji University in Shanghai, with the great enthusiasm to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, followed the brilliant path of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," broke through layer upon layer of obstacles, and put forward a revolutionary educational reform plan.

On the construction site of their practice of this educational reform plan, what is presented to us is a picture full of boundless vitality. Here, students go on stage and debate with teachers; workers go on stage and debate with designers; the People's Liberation Army goes on stage and propagates Mao Zedong Thought. Here, students take learning as the main task, beginning to learn from workers and the army, workers beginning to learn from literature and the army, students, workers, teachers, and designers together learning the main course of Mao Zedong Thought, learning Chairman Mao's quotations and party-building theories about educational revolution, together criticizing the revisionist educational line and party-building line, together struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. What is this? This is a prototype of a new proletarian educational system.

On some construction sites, there was once a debate: Should we learn design first or construction first? On the surface, it seems to be a work arrangement problem, but in essence, it contains a struggle between two worldviews. Those who advocated learning design first thought they were college students and would go out to be engineers, so they should learn design first. Learning design first means learning book knowledge first. The soldiers and workers on the construction site pointed out to them: Learning design first or construction first is not a method problem, but ultimately a problem of which road the educational revolution should take, whether politics comes first or business comes first, whether practice comes first or book knowledge comes first. The worker comrades spoke earnestly: Chairman Mao entrusted you to us workers to cultivate, and we will definitely cultivate you into the successors of the proletariat. These words deeply touched the souls of the students. They said, in the past, under the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, the design was a blueprint for fame and fortune, and the construction was a personal mansion of individualism. Now, Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" has drawn a blueprint for communism. We are determined to be nameless paving stones for the great cause of communism!

In the past year, the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai, with the working class as the main force, have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in the great criticism, great unity, and three-in-one combination, always taking the lead in the country. Now, they are following Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party building: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies, a vigorous vanguard organization." They have launched a mass high tide of deeply studying Chairman Mao's party-building line and thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line throughout the city.

The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai remember the great leader's teaching: "You must care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." While launching a great study of Chairman Mao's party-building line and a great criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line, they further expose the cover of class struggle in the cultural, news, publishing, educational, health, and old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Municipal People's Committee, and other party and government organs, clean up the ranks, and establish a proletarian class team. They are determined to take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, continue to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes on all fronts, fiercely struggle against the "self" of the bourgeoisie, and firmly establish the "public" of the proletariat, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, following Chairman Mao, and determined to be proletarian revolutionaries who carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like the King of Chu." The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai and the broad revolutionary masses are determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the new year and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛泽东思想化为人们的灵魂
    上海无产阶级文化大革命形势大好
    震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，正进入全面胜利的一年。
    在过去的一年里，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，使上海一千万人民的灵魂深处，经历了天翻地覆的变化。
    黄浦江畔海关上东方红的钟声，迎来了上海港的黎明。
    在部队的营房、机场和军舰上，在工厂的车间、学校的课堂和人民公社的田野上，工人、农民、战士和红卫兵小将，面对心中最红的红太阳，首先敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！然后齐声背诵“老三篇”。
    我们看到，在公共汽车和电车上，人们在激烈争辩着怎样解放干部，议论着怎样才算毛主席的好党员……
    在人民公社的打谷场上，六七十岁的老公公戴着老花眼镜正在和他的小孙子一起，一个字一个字地念着《为人民服务》。
    在海上，在空中，我们举世无双的人民解放军，正用毛主席语录在指挥着巡逻、训练和战备。
    在街道里弄，我们看到，过去眼睛里只有鼻子底下的一个炉子、一只篮子的老妈妈，现在和她的女儿、外孙一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。
    毛主席的一系列最新指示，正在掌握千百万群众，伟大的毛泽东思想正在化为人们的灵魂。
    在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”
    在无产阶级专政下要继续进行革命，要造资产阶级反动路线的反，造钻进无产阶级专政机构内部的走资派的反，造一切剥削阶级思想的反，造头脑中“私”字的反，这就是伟大领袖毛主席武装七亿人民彻底炸毁旧世界的光辉思想。
    上海市以工人阶级为主力军的无产阶级革命派，正是在伟大统帅毛主席的直接指挥下，运用这一威力无比的光辉思想，冲锋陷阵，所向披靡。
    上海工人统一的战斗组织——上海工人革命造反总司令部的诞生、成长和发展，就是最生动的例证。“工总司”领导成员之一的王秀珍，和她的战友一起，经历了这一战斗的历程。
    无产阶级文化大革命初期，国棉三十厂的纺织女工王秀珍，响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，贴出了全厂闻名的大字报，揭开了厂党委内的阶级斗争盖子。可是，她一下子就被打成“裴多菲俱乐部”分子。旧上海市委派到工厂的工作组威胁她：“你还听不听党的话？你还要不要党籍？”王秀珍展开了激烈的思想斗争。她看着毛主席像，一遍又一遍地读着毛主席的教导：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，……无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争”。毛主席的教导，象一轮朝阳驱散了她思想上的迷雾：此时此地，正是一个真正的共产党员为保卫党中央、毛主席而进行不疲倦的斗争的时候！作为厂文革主任的王秀珍，跑到旧上海市委去告工作组的状。
    她遇到了“工总司”现在的主要负责人王洪文同志。王洪文到过北京，和红卫兵一起接受了我们伟大领袖毛主席的检阅，看到了毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报，听到了伟大领袖的声音。他告诉王秀珍：“毛主席说从中央到地方都有一批人站在资产阶级反动立场上镇压革命群众，毛主席说造反有理。毛主席热烈支持我们起来革命造反！”
    毛主席说：“造反有理。”这声音象平地一声春雷，象天空中万道闪电，照亮了这个普通的女工、优秀的共产党员王秀珍前进的道路。她一下子看清了展现在面前的是一场你死我活的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗！靠向旧上海市委“告状”行吗？不行，他们都是一路货！靠一个人一个厂行吗？不行！要把毛主席“造反有理”的声音传到工人中去，组织起千千万万工人革命造反大军！
    “造反有理”！一九六六年十一月九日，“上海工人革命造反总司令部”宣告成立。文化大革命的主力军登上了政治舞台，上海的政治力量对比顿时改观。王秀珍参加了“工总司”的成立大会。
    从此，王秀珍和上海的工人革命造反派、革命的红卫兵，高举“造反有理”的大旗，高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的战歌，冲破中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人制造的白色恐怖，在安亭、在解放日报、在康平路……向着资产阶级反动路线发动猛烈的进攻！
    王秀珍和上海成百万革命造反大军一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高唱“造反有理”的战歌，掀起了轰动全国的“一月革命”风暴，吹响了夺党内一小撮走资派的权的进军号！
    王秀珍和上海的革命造反派一起，高举“斗私，批修”的伟大旗帜，高唱“造反有理”的战歌，向自己头脑里的“私”字开火，和传统观念彻底决裂，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子！
    王秀珍永远不会忘记：去年五月一日晚上，在天安门城楼上，她带着上海二百万工人二百万颗火热的心，见到了心中最红的红太阳毛主席。王秀珍双手紧紧捧住毛主席的手，望着毛主席亲切慈祥的笑容，把千言万语变成一句话：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”这一句，是最最重要的一句。它表达了上海二百万工人的衷心祝愿，表达了全中国、全世界革命人民的共同心愿！王秀珍忙着从衣袋里拿出“一月革命”纪念章，亲手献给了伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席走去和别的观礼代表见面，王秀珍紧紧跟着毛主席，热情高呼着：“紧跟毛主席！紧跟毛主席！”
    紧跟伟大领袖毛主席！这是上海工人革命造反派的誓言，是上海一千万人民的誓言！他们决心永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。资产阶级企图在那里复辟，就在那里把它打下去！那里出现修正主义，就在那里把它打下去！
    团结大多数，解放全人类
    在毛主席“解放全人类”的光辉思想照耀下，上海无产阶级革命派的灵魂深处，发生了深刻的变化，达到了新的境界。他们从争取自身的解放，到争取阶级的解放，争取全人类的解放，一步步攀登共产主义世界观的高峰。
    黄浦江畔的沪东造船厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，由于派性作怪，两个革命群众组织，把敌人放在一旁，整整打了五个月“内战”，迷失了斗争的大方向。他们也曾几次谈判，总是各自指责对方，闹得不欢而散。
    从北京传来了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”驻厂的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队组织两派负责人一起活学活用毛主席的最新指示。一个较大组织的负责人钱敖川面对着红彤彤的毛主席著作，心潮澎湃，他想：毛主席号召我们要解放全人类，而我看到的只是一个小山头。毛主席要求我们多作自我批评，而我是专门用放大镜看对方的缺点。他越想，越觉得辜负了毛主席的教导；越想，越觉得自己派性严重，对不起毛主席。他激动地向小组织的负责人萧松柏说出了心里话：“我一向老大自居，认为我们大山头就是要吃掉你们小山头。千不该，万不该，最大的不该是把阶级兄弟当敌人打！客观上帮了敌人的忙！”萧松柏也作了触及灵魂的自我检查。他说：“我们是唯我独左，唯我独革，认为只有我们最革命，别人统统不行。我们再不要只抱住自己一个小团体，忘掉了七亿人民和世界几十亿人民，忘掉中国革命和世界革命的前途！”两派负责人越学心越明，眼越亮。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全厂无产阶级革命派大联合起来了。
    发生“安亭事件”的安亭地区，当时是上海两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的地方，如今成了红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。从安亭地区上海自动化仪表九厂的变化，我们看到毛主席“解放全人类”的思想如何在普通的工人心中发芽、生根、开花、结果。
    这个厂的造反队负责人张振芳在掌权后有个思想疙瘩没有解开。他想：过去有人围攻我们造反派，今天也要请他们吃吃苦头。在这样的思想指导下，群众团结不起来，革命搞不好，生产也上不去。他也很苦恼，两次想交权不干。正在这个节骨眼上，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席说：“要争取团结一切可以团结的人们”，“开展谈心活动”。毛主席的话，字字句句敲打在张振芳的心弦上。他想：我为什么不能团结大多数革命群众一道革命呢？是“私”字使我和群众之间隔了一道鸿沟，“私”字使我迷失了斗争的大方向。毛主席啊，毛主席！迷路时想到您的教导方向明。为全人类求解放，才是无产阶级革命派的胸怀。
    张振芳从“我”字中解放出来，眼中看到了广大群众，身上就增添了无穷力量。他主动找受过他点名批评的王联群谈心交心，他说：“过去你围攻过我，那是受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽。我反过来也反对你，就不对了。我们是一根藤上的苦瓜，这笔账应当算到中国的赫鲁晓夫身上。让我们团结起来共同对敌！”王联群十分感动，给驻厂的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队写了一封热情洋溢的公开信，并附上早在枕下压着的金光闪闪的两枚“五好职工”纪念章。她说：“我现在不配戴这两枚纪念章。我一定以你们为榜样，以革命造反派为榜样，真正起来革命，努力做毛主席的好工人。”解放军在全厂群众大会上，把两枚“五好职工”纪念章给王联群戴在胸前，勉励她做一名毛主席的革命战士。革命造反队给她戴上了红色的“造反队”袖章。
    以革命利益为第一生命
    在上海，有不少在战火纷飞的年代里经历了南征北战的老战士，进城以后由于放松了对自己世界观的改造，受了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人的毒害和蒙蔽，在文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，遭到革命的群众运动的猛烈冲击。经过群众斗争大风雨的洗礼，他们冲掉了身上的政治灰尘，唤回了革命的青春，重新抖擞起当年奔杀在战场上的革命干劲，以新的战斗姿态出现在无产阶级革命队伍的行列里。
    原杨浦区委第一书记、现在的杨浦区革命委员会负责人张敬标同志，就是这些老战士中的一个。革命群众起来批判他的错误，他情绪非常对立。
    上海市无产阶级革命派对中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋发起了一次次的大批判、大斗争，揭开了两个阶级复辟和反复辟的惊心动魄的斗争，使张敬标醒悟了。革命群众的严肃批判，红卫兵小将的耐心帮助，毛主席的最新指示，使他开始正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站起来革命。毛主席说：“老干部过去有功劳，但是不能靠吃老本，要很好地在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼改造自己，要立新功，立新劳。”张敬标一遍又一遍地学习着毛主席的最新指示，越学心里越激动。他想，毛主席对我们这些老战士是多么关怀和爱护，我的确辜负了毛主席的期望。他越想心情越沉重，但又走向另外一个极端，全盘否定了自己。因此他只“求解放而不求结合”，“求一般结合而不愿当第一把手”。红卫兵小将对他念了一段毛主席语录：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”又和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示：“要斗私，批修”。毛主席的最新指示，再一次震动了张敬标的灵魂。他想，破私，要破在要害处，现在自己“私”字的要害就是不愿再挑革命重担；立公，要立在根本上，这“公”字的根本就是要以革命利益为第一生命，要跟毛主席革命到底。
    毛泽东思想的光芒，再一次照亮了张敬标前进的方向。在宣布结合张敬标当第一把手的革命群众大会上，张敬标禁不住热泪盈眶。他在台上站了很久，最后讲了这样一句话：“粉身碎骨也要跟毛主席革命到底！”
    在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命中，不仅挽救、教育了大批革命领导干部，而且我们兴奋地看到，上海市许多普普通通的工人，在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，正锻炼成长为可靠的革命接班人。
    上海电表厂的革委会委员胡汉章同志，是全厂第一批起来造反的战士，第一个贴出大联合的大字报。在推动全厂实现革命大联合时，他不争个人席位，主动保证对方队委当选。他被群众再一次选为厂革委会委员和车间革委会副主任后，始终保持普通一兵的本色。他收到市革委会的国庆宴会请帖和参加国庆观礼的票子，他想到的是荣誉应当归于革命群众。厂里不少老师傅活学活用毛主席著作很好，应当让他们参加宴会和革命派当权后第一个国庆节的观礼。他把请帖和观礼票送给了两位老工人，自己留在厂里值班。这是什么风格？这是全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级革命派的风格，是不谋私利、不出风头、埋头苦干、永远和群众心连心的革命派的风格。
    誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”
    上海同济大学的一批革命小将，他们正是怀着将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的豪情壮志，沿着毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉道路，冲破层层阻力，提出了一个革命化的教改方案。
    在他们实践这一教改方案的工地上，展现在我们面前的是一幅具有无限生命力的图景。在这里，学生上讲坛，和教师展开辩论；工人上讲坛，和设计人员展开辩论；解放军上讲坛，宣传毛泽东思想。在这里，学生以学为主，开始学工、学军，工人开始学文、学军，学生、工人、教师和设计人员一道学习毛泽东思想的主课，学习毛主席关于教育革命的语录和建党学说，一同批判修正主义的教育路线和建党路线，一道斗私批修。这是什么？这是一种崭新的无产阶级教育体制的雏型。
    在有的工地上，曾经发生这样一场争辩：先学设计还是先学施工？表面上看来，这是一个工作安排问题，实质包含了两种世界观的斗争。主张先学设计的同学以为自己是个大学生，出去总要当个工程师，当然要先学设计。先学设计就得先学书本知识。在工地工作的解放军和工人同志向他们指出：先学设计还是先学施工不是一个方法问题，归根到底是教育革命走哪条道路的问题，是政治第一还是业务第一，是实践第一还是书本知识第一。工人同志语重心长地说：毛主席把你们交给我们工人阶级培养，我们一定要把你们培养成无产阶级的接班人。这番话深深触动了学生的灵魂。他们说，过去在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，设计的是成名成家的蓝图，构筑的是个人主义的“洋楼”。现在，毛主席的“五·七”指示绘出了通向共产主义的蓝图。我们决心为伟大的共产主义工程，甘当无名的铺路石！
    一年来，上海市以工人阶级为主力军的无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合方面，一直走在全国前面。现在，他们又遵循毛主席关于整党建党的最新指示：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”在全市掀起一个深入学习毛主席的建党路线、彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线的群众性高潮。
    上海市的无产阶级革命派牢记伟大领袖“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，在掀起对毛主席建党路线的大学习、对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的大批判的同时，在文艺界、新闻界、出版界、教育界、卫生界和旧上海市委、市人委等党政机关，进一步揭开阶级斗争的盖子，清理队伍，树立无产阶级的阶级队伍。他们决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，在各条战线上继续举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，将毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，紧跟毛主席，誓当决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”上海市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众决心在新的一年里，全面落实毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
