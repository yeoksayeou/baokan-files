Three comrades from Xinhua News Agency's Yangon Bureau, Teng Wenqi, Li Chengyi, and Liu Dejin, who were unjustly expelled from Myanmar by the reactionary Myanmar government, arrived back in Beijing by plane from Yangon this evening in glory.

Responsible comrades from the Foreign Ministry's News Bureau, First Asian Bureau, the All-China Journalists Association, and Xinhua News Agency, including Yuan Rulin, Chen Mianzhi, Lü Bin, and Wang Weizhen, as well as representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction of Xinhua News Agency, were at the airport to warmly welcome the comrades returning from Yangon. They expressed their heartfelt greetings.

At the airport, representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction presented Teng Wenqi, Li Chengyi, and Liu Dejin with Chairman Mao's badges and revolutionary books, including "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The welcoming crowd raised their fists and shouted, "Strongly protest the persecution and unjust expulsion of our Yangon Bureau staff by the reactionary Myanmar government!" "The reactionary Myanmar government, following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in opposing China, will meet a bad end!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar!" "Long live, ten thousand times live, our great leader Chairman Mao!"

This morning, when Teng Wenqi, Li Chengyi, and Liu Dejin left Yangon, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, Xiao Ming, and other embassy staff, as well as over 300 patriotic overseas Chinese, went to the airport to see them off. At the airport, they together read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Before Teng Wenqi, Li Chengyi, and Liu Dejin left Yangon, some Myanmar friends visited them, expressing great indignation at the reactionary Myanmar government's persecution and unjust expulsion of Xinhua News Agency staff.

    新华社驻仰光分社三同志光荣回到北京
    欢迎群众愤怒高呼：缅甸反动政府追随美帝、苏修反华决没有好下场！
    新华社二十九日讯　被缅甸反动政府无理驱逐离开缅甸的新华社驻仰光分社工作人员滕文启、李成义、刘德金三同志，由仰光乘飞机于今晚光荣回到北京。
    外交部新闻司、第一亚洲司和中华全国新闻工作者协会、新华社总社的负责人袁鲁林、陈勉之、吕彬、王唯真等同志，以及新华社无产阶级革命派代表，到机场热烈欢迎由仰光回到祖国的战友，并向他们表示亲切慰问。
    在机场上，无产阶级革命派代表向滕文启、李成义、刘德金赠送了毛主席像章和革命宝书《毛主席语录》。欢迎群众振臂高呼：“强烈抗议缅甸反动政府迫害和无理驱逐我仰光分社工作人员！”“缅甸反动政府追随美帝、苏修反华决没有好下场！”“中缅两国人民的友谊万岁！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    滕文启、李成义、刘德金三同志今天上午离开仰光时，我国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明和使馆其他同志，以及爱国侨胞三百多人，曾到机场送行。在机场上，他们共同朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    在滕文启、李成义、刘德金三同志离开仰光前，一些缅甸朋友曾去看望他们，对缅甸反动政府迫害和无理驱逐新华社工作人员表示十分愤慨。
