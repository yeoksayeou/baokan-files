Editor's Note: Currently, many cities have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in their streets. The broad masses of residents and street cadres are deeply studying the "Three Articles" and Mao Zedong's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are using "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" as the guideline, conducting bitter-sweet education and education on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads; they are vigorously carrying out revolutionary criticism, eliminating the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in every corner.

The streets are an important battlefield for class struggle, a place where the broad masses of residents live, and where millions of children grow up. Holding study classes in the streets, spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of residents, carrying out the ideological transformation of the people, making them step out of the small family circle, and more actively care about national and world affairs. This is of great significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, uprooting the roots of revisionism, cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and for grasping the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness for war.

The street study classes should be flexible and varied, adapting to different people, times, and places. Only in this way can the broad masses of residents be most widely attracted to participate, and the classes can be sustained, turning every street into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Step Out of the Family Circle, Everyone Cares About National Affairs: Chongwen District Streets Hold Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

From our reporter: The broad masses of residents and revolutionary mass organizations in the streets of Beijing's Chongwen District, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Currently, more than 85% of the residents in the entire district have participated in short-term rotational Mao Zedong Thought study classes and long-term Mao Zedong's Works study groups. The classes are lively and vibrant, and the enthusiasm of the masses for learning is very high, transforming the spirit and work of the streets.

A great enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works has been ignited.

Chongwen District is vast, with many elderly people, women, and children, much housework, many handicrafts, and many illiterates. Yet, those who participate in the study classes generally do not arrive late, leave early, or take leave without reason. An elderly person living in Hepu Factory who is 63 years old has to walk one li to the study class from home. He is not afraid of the cold or tiredness, always sets out early, and has never been late. He said: "In the old society, the poor had no way to live. Chairman Mao gave us a happy life and also gave us the opportunity to study. When I think of Chairman Mao's teaching of 'firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory,' this bit of hardship is nothing!" A housewife living in Chinaqiang Hutong, who used to spend the whole day at home doing handicrafts and calculating how much money she could earn in a month, raised her awareness through ideological mobilization and signed up to participate in the study class. She said: "In the past, I only thought about the things under my nose, which was wrong. Now I want to enter the study class and learn how to do revolutionary Mao Zedong Thought."

Many street residents in this district say: "A person who does not study Mao Zedong Thought has no soul and will forget their roots, suffer twice." "A person who only says they love Chairman Mao but does not actively apply Chairman Mao's works cannot be said to love him." Therefore, they think of many ways to overcome the various practical difficulties of participating in Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Increased the masses' class and class struggle awareness.

In the study classes held in the streets of this district, residents actively apply Chairman Mao's works and carry out revolutionary criticism. They combine the actual situation of the streets and focus on criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as "the extinction of class struggle," "exploitation has merits," "four freedoms," "merging public and private," and "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage."

They carry out revolutionary criticism in two ways. First, using one of Chairman Mao's viewpoints and a segment of personal experience from the old society to refute one of China's Khrushchev's fallacies. They say this method is rational and sensory, with clear contrasts and right and wrong. Second, through the exposure and struggle against the reactionary words and deeds of unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, further criticize China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of restoring capitalism. The exposure and struggle against unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are carried out as follows: first, determine the crime, second, peel off the disguise, third, discuss the harm, fourth, trace the root and elevate it, fifth, compare the past and present, and sixth, accuse and denounce. This method ignites the masses' enthusiasm for fighting the enemy, greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses, and greatly dampens the arrogance of the class enemies. Some housewives say: "Usually, I feel that these people are my neighbors, and I can't distance myself from them. It turns out that the class enemy is right in front of me!" The residents' committee cadres who originally wanted to quit were even more moved, saying: "Quitting is exactly what the class enemy wants, the knife handle cannot be dropped, the stamp cannot be put down, and we must struggle with the enemy for a lifetime and serve the people for a lifetime."

Promoted family "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" activities.

The widespread establishment of study classes in the streets has greatly promoted the residents' holding of family "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" meetings. The content and methods of family "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" meetings are: study Chairman Mao's works every day, conduct self-criticism once a week, put national affairs first and personal affairs last, praise good people and good deeds, and criticize bad people and bad deeds. The "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" in family meetings is a good way to mobilize the whole family to besiege the "selfishness." There are parents who criticize themselves, and there are parents who help their children criticize; there are children who criticize themselves, and there are children who help their parents criticize.

On a street in Chongwenmen, there is a housewife from a poor family who is the head of the residents' committee. Although the old society left her with eye disease, she still insists on studying Chairman Mao's works and works actively. Her husband is also from a poor family, but he worries that she reads too much and works too hard, which will affect her eyes, so he often asks her to study less. She feels that this is her husband's selfishness at work, so she held a family "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" meeting. She said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works makes me clear-minded and energetic in my work. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, I can't do my work well, and even if my eyes are not bad, I am still blind." Her husband was very moved and conducted self-criticism. From then on, he took the initiative to do more housework, allowing his wife to have more time to study Chairman Mao's works and do the work of the residents.

Many people praise the benefits of family "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Fight Selfishness" meetings, saying: "It is 'promoting the inner with the outer, promoting the outer with the inner, and eradicating selfishness completely.'"

Promoted the mass movement of actively applying Chairman Mao's works.

Another feature of the study classes held in the streets of this district is the holding of large and small reporting meetings, promoting the mass movement of actively applying Chairman Mao's works. Holding various reporting meetings is an effective way to summarize and improve, exchange experiences, set up models, expand influence, and promote learning. At the end of last year, a district-wide reporting meeting on actively applying Chairman Mao's works was held, with representatives from all 288 residents' committees in the district, totaling more than 1,000 people. The masses said: "I have never participated in such a successful and enthusiastic meeting." Some housewives said: "In the future, even if the sky falls, I will still study Chairman Mao's works! If I continue to guard the small family every day, it will be too ungrateful to Chairman Mao!" The day after the reporting meeting, Tian Tan, Chongwenmen, and other places immediately set up five new study classes. Cangfo Temple and other streets even organized children, called the "Red Guards Propaganda Team." In the area around Qianmen, there are 44 residents' committees, which are divided into five groups, with one group as one propaganda point. The propaganda activities of Mao Zedong Thought are very lively and frequent. On a street in Chongwenmen, there are seven elderly women, with an average age of over 60. They voluntarily organize themselves, often recite the "Three Articles" and song of quotations, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to people.

### 走出家庭小圈子　人人关心国家大事  崇文区街道大办毛泽东思想学习班

专栏：

    编者按：目前，许多城市的街道办起了毛泽东思想学习班。广大居民群众和街道干部，都在深入学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，进行忆苦思甜教育和两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育；他们大力开展革命的大批判，清除中国赫鲁晓夫在各个角落里散布的反革命修正主义流毒。
      街道，是阶级斗争的重要阵线，是广大居民生活的场所，是千百万儿童成长的地方。在街道大办学习班，把毛泽东思想灌输到广大居民群众中去，搞好人的思想革命化，使他们走出家庭的小天地，更加积极地关心国家大事，关心世界大事。这对于巩固无产阶级专政，挖掉修正主义根子，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，对于抓革命，促生产、促工作、促战备，都有着十分重大的意义。
      街道办学习班，要灵活多样，因人因时因地制宜。这样才能最广泛地吸收广大居民参加，才能持久地办下去，把每一条街道都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    走出家庭小圈子　人人关心国家大事
    崇文区街道大办毛泽东思想学习班
    本报讯　北京市崇文区街道广大居民群众和革命群众组织，在解放军帮助下，开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。目前，全区街道的百分之八十五以上的居民已参加了短期轮训的毛泽东思想学习班和长期坚持的毛主席著作学习组。学习班办得生动活泼，群众学习的积极性很高，精神面貌和街道工作焕然一新。
  激起了群众学习毛主席著作的空前热情
    崇文区范围很广，居民中老人多，妇女孩子多，家务事多，做加工活的多，不识字的多。可是参加学习班的人，一般都能做到不迟到早退不无故请假。居住在河泊厂一个六十三岁的老人，从家里到学习班要走一里路，他不怕冷，不怕累，每天提早动身，始终没有迟到过。他说：“旧社会逼得穷人没法生活，毛主席给了我们幸福生活，又给了我们学习机会。我一想到毛主席‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’的教导，这点困难，就算不得什么了！”居住在中国强胡同的一个家庭妇女，过去整天在家做加工活，盘算一个月能挣多少钱；经过思想动员，提高了认识，报名参加了学习班。她说：“过去整天只想鼻子尖底下的事，太不对了，现在我要进学习班，学习怎样干革命的毛泽东思想。”
    这个区的许多街道居民群众说：“一个人不学习毛泽东思想，就没有灵魂，就会忘本，吃二遍苦。”“一个人光说热爱毛主席，不活学活用毛主席著作，就不能算是热爱。”于是，他们想尽许多办法，克服参加毛泽东思想学习班的各种实际困难。增强了群众的阶级、阶级斗争观点
    在这个区街道举办的学习班上，居民们活学活用毛主席著作，开展了革命大批判。他们结合街道的实际情况，着重批判了中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“四大自由”、“公私溶化论”、
  “吃小亏占大便宜”等反动谬论。
    他们开展革命大批判采用了两个办法。第一，用毛主席的一个观点和自己在旧社会的一段亲身遭遇，来批驳中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论。他们说，这种办法有理性有感性，对照鲜明，是非清楚。第二，通过对死不悔改的地富反坏右分子的反动言行的揭发斗争，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。揭发、斗争死不悔改的地富反坏右分子是这样进行的：一定罪状，二剥画皮，三论危害，四挖根上纲，五今昔对比，六控诉声讨。这种办法激发了群众对敌斗争的热情，大长革命群众的志气，大灭阶级敌人的威风。有的家庭妇女说：“平时总觉得和这些人是左邻右舍，拉不开情面，原来阶级敌人就在我面前！”原来想撂挑子的居委会的干部触动更大，他们说：“撂挑子不干，正合阶级敌人的算盘，刀把子不能丢，印把子不能放，要同敌人斗争一辈子，为人民服务一辈子。”
      促进了家庭的斗私批修活动
    街道广泛举办学习班，大大促进了居民群众开家庭会斗私批修。家庭斗私批修会的内容和做法是：天天学习毛主席著作，每周一次自我批评，国家事情抢在前面，个人事情放在后面，对好人好事要夸，对坏人坏事要抓。家庭会上的斗私批修，是发动一家人围剿“私”字的好办法。有父母自己斗私的，也有父母帮助子女斗私的；有子女自己斗私的，也有子女帮助父母斗私的。
    在崇文门的一条街道上，有个出身穷苦的家庭妇女，是居民委员会主任，虽然旧社会给她留下了眼病，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作，工作积极肯干。她的丈夫也是个出身穷苦的人，但是担心她看书多、工作忙影响眼睛，就经常要她少学点。她感到这是丈夫的私字在作怪，就开了个家庭斗私批修会。她说：“学习毛主席著作使我心明眼亮，工作有方向有劲头，不学习毛主席著作，工作做不好，眼睛不坏也是个睁眼瞎子。”她的丈夫听了很感动，做了自我批评。从此，他主动多做家务事，让妻子有更多的时间学习毛主席著作，去做居民群众的工作。
    许多群众在称赞家庭斗私批修会的好处时说：这是“以外促内，以内促外，私修无处藏，连根拔掉它。”
    推动了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动
    这个区街道举办的学习班的另一个特点是，举行大大小小的讲用会，推动活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。举行各类讲用会，是总结提高、交流经验、树立典型、扩大影响、促进学习的有效的办法。去年年底，开了一个全区性的活学活用毛主席著作的讲用大会，全区的二百八十八个居民委员会都有代表参加，总共一千多人。群众说：“从来没有参加过这样成功、热烈的大会”。有的家庭妇女说：“今后就是天塌下来，我也要学习毛主席著作！再整天守着小家庭过日子，就太对不起毛主席了！”讲用大会的第二天，天坛、崇文门等地立即新办起了五个学习班。卧佛寺等街道连儿童都组织起来了，叫做“红小兵宣传队”。在前门一带，有四十四个居委会，他们分成五个片，一个片是一个宣传点，毛泽东思想的宣传活动搞得很活跃，也很经常。在崇文门的一条街道上，有七个老太太，平均年龄已经六十多岁了。她们自动串连在一起，经常背诵“老三篇”、语录歌，向人们宣传毛泽东思想。
