The support team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the commercial system of Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, helped various revolutionary mass organizations hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They fostered a revolutionary learning style, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and severely criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit. The eleven units and over two hundred departments under the county's commercial system have all achieved revolutionary unity by department, establishing the Revolutionary Committee of the Proletarian Revolutionaries in the Commercial System.

The revolutionary workers in the commercial system of Kaiping County united to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in January last year. Later, due to the instigation of the capitalist roaders and the influence of factionalism, they split into two major factions. Although the leaders of the two factions had discussed revolutionary unity many times, they could not reach an agreement. Recently, with the help of the PLA support team, the two factions jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

At the beginning, both factions prepared materials against each other, stockpiled "ammunition," and selected "gunners" to engage in a fierce battle during the study class. Facing this situation, the support team realized that to hold a successful study class, the first issue to address was the learning style, which meant addressing the class attitude towards the great leader Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. They conducted activities of "three remembrances, three denunciations, and three praises" with the students: remembering the history of family liberation, denouncing the evils of the old society, and praising the kindness of Chairman Mao; remembering the history of the two-line struggle during the Cultural Revolution, denouncing the evils of the bourgeois reactionary line, and praising the brilliance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a series of latest instructions; remembering the revolutionary struggle in their own units and departments during the Cultural Revolution, denouncing the harm of selfishness and factionalism, and praising the benefits of following Chairman Mao's words to achieve revolutionary unity. Through these activities, the students deeply understood that following Chairman Mao's words and implementing his latest instructions is victory; deviating from Chairman Mao's latest instructions and great strategic deployment will definitely lead to mistakes. The students abandoned their original intentions and prepared to make more self-criticisms to promote revolutionary unity.

As the study deepened, most comrades repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, examined their performance during the Cultural Revolution, and launched an attack on bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. However, some students' self-criticisms were not sincere, exposing only superficial selfishness, not the selfishness deep in the soul, or exposing a little and hiding a lot, waiting for each other. The main reasons were fear of being criticized, fear of lowering their organization's and personal prestige, and fear of not being elected as committee members during unity. Facing these thoughts, the support team organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, and linked them to the heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, making everyone realize that only by genuinely taking up the iron broom of criticism and self-criticism to sweep away the selfishness deep in the soul can they overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, be loyal to Chairman Mao, and truly achieve revolutionary unity.

After abandoning the fear, the two factions in the Commercial Bureau thoroughly exposed their factionalism and conducted sincere self-criticisms.

The support team also closely coordinated the activities inside and outside the study class, making the revolutionary learning style of self-criticism take root among the masses, mobilizing the masses to overcome factionalism, creating a good situation of fostering revolutionary learning style and sweeping away factionalism, and strongly promoting revolutionary unity.

The revolutionary mass organizations of the Guangzhou Water Supply Company, with the help of the PLA, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, achieved revolutionary unity through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

    狠斗灵魂深处的私字　坚决斩断派性大毒蛇
    开平县商业系统革命职工实现革命大联合
    在解放军帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进了思想革命化
    本报讯　中国人民解放军某部驻广东开平县商业系统支左小组，帮助各革命群众组织举办毛泽东思想学习班，大树革命好学风，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，狠批了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性。这个县商业系统所属十一个单位、两百多个部门，全部实现了按部门的革命大联合，成立了商业系统无产阶级革命派大联合委员会。
    开平县商业系统的革命职工，去年一月曾经联合起来夺了商业局党内一小撮走资派的权，后来由于走资派的挑动和派性作怪，分裂成两大派组织。两派头头虽然多次协商过革命大联合的问题，都谈不拢来。最近在解放军支左人员帮助下，两派群众组织联合举办了毛泽东思想学习班。
    开始，两派各自整好了对方的材料，备足了“炮弹”，选好了“炮手”，准备在学习班里大干一场。针对这种情况，支左小组的同志认识到，要办好学习班，首先要解决学风问题，这就是首先要解决对待伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的阶级感情问题。于是，他们同学员们一起进行“三忆、三控诉、三颂扬”活动：即忆家庭翻身史，控诉旧社会的罪恶，颂扬毛主席的恩情；忆文化大革命中两条路线斗争的历史，控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，颂扬毛主席革命路线和一系列最新指示的英明伟大；忆本单位本部门文化大革命的战斗历程，控诉私字和派性的危害，颂扬听毛主席的话搞革命大联合的好处。学员们由此深深认识到：听毛主席的话，落实毛主席的最新指示，就是胜利；只要离开毛主席的最新指示和伟大战略部署，就一定犯错误。两派学员打消了原来的念头，准备多作自我批评，促进革命大联合。
    随着学习的深入，大多数同志反复学习毛主席的最新指示，对照检查自己在文化大革命中的表现，向资产阶级、小资产阶级派性开火。但是，有些学员的自我批评的姿态不高，亮私心亮表面的，不亮灵魂深处的，或者讲一点，留一点，互相等待。主要原因是怕对方抓住辫子不放，怕降低了自己组织和个人的威信，怕大联合时当不上委员。针对这些活思想，支左人员组织大家学习毛主席关于批评与自我批评的论述，并且联系学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的英雄事迹，使大家认识到只有真正拿起批评与自我批评这个铁扫把，猛扫灵魂深处的私字，才能打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，才能做到对毛主席无限忠诚，才能真正实现革命大联合。
    商业局本部的两派革命群众组织丢掉“怕”字以后，都把自己的派性翻箱倒柜地全盘端出来，进行认真的自我批评。
    支左小组的同志，还把学习班内外的活动紧密地配合起来，使各自多做自我批评的革命学风扎根在群众之中，发动群众打倒派性，形成了一个群众性大树革命学风，横扫派性的大好局面，有力地推动了革命大联合。
