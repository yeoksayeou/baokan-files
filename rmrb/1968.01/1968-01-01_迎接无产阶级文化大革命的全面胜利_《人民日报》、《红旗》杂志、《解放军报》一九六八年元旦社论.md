A brilliant and radiant 1968 has arrived.

The East is red, the sun is rising. At the beginning of this new year, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, with profound class feelings, sincerely wish our great teacher Chairman Mao a long life!

Under the brilliant leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the first great proletarian cultural revolution in human history has achieved decisive victories in 1967. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the great struggle to achieve a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution has begun.

Currently, the great proletarian cultural revolution is in an excellent situation. The unprecedentedly broad and deep revolutionary mass movement is continuing to develop along the track indicated by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary criticism and repudiation is further unfolding on all fronts. The counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are being extensively exposed by the people, making people have a more concrete and clear understanding of the importance of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. Revolutionary committees are being established one after another in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The educational revolution and the struggle-criticism-transformation on all fronts are gradually taking on a new appearance. The cultural revolution has promoted work in all aspects. The successful tests of our country's missiles and hydrogen bombs have shocked the world. Agricultural production has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The country is boiling with enthusiasm, and revolutionary scenes are flourishing everywhere.

The most important aspect of this excellent situation is: after Chairman Mao's latest instructions were made public to the broad revolutionary masses, a tide of earnest study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has emerged. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprouted up like bamboo after a spring rain all over the country, becoming schools for the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and broad battlefields for "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness." They have greatly raised the ideological awareness of the broad revolutionary cadres and masses. The pace of revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones has accelerated. The development of the revolutionary situation is like a river in full spate, fully proving Chairman Mao's scientific foresight when he pointed out during his inspection that "in a few more months, the overall situation will become even better."

In the new year, the entire Party, the entire army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, and the people of the entire country must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, summon up all our strength, strive to be the best, and continue our efforts from the ideological, political, economic, and organizational aspects to achieve a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

To achieve this great strategic goal, the combat tasks before us are:

First, we must carry out the great mass movement of living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply. As Vice Chairman Lin Biao said, "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, becoming an atomic bomb of invincible spiritual power." The new year will be a year when tens of millions of revolutionary people firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought to achieve new great victories.

Leaders at all levels and revolutionary organizations must vigorously promote the education of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen ideological and political work, and effectively run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. To live study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, we must first study and apply Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions on the great proletarian cultural revolution. We must ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented, making Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and specific policies directly grasped by the broad masses of the people, turning them into the conscious revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution. Matter turns into spirit, and spirit turns into matter. The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

We must continue to carry forward the revolutionary academic style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, deeply understand them, and resolutely implement them. We must frequently inspect and summarize our work. Anyone who deviates from Chairman Mao's instructions, goes against Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, acts smart, and takes the wrong path instead of the right one will surely lose their way and make mistakes. All revolutionary organizations must take Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their sole guide for action. Any words and deeds that go against Mao Zedong Thought, whether from the right or the extreme "left," must be firmly resisted and opposed. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter must become a model in studying, implementing, propagating, and defending the latest instructions.

Second, we must continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, promote and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and deepen the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units and departments.

In the new year, we will further expose the crimes of China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents, making their ugly faces and plots exposed in broad daylight, and making their dreams of restoration completely shattered. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, adopt various forms, and thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist line in all fields, eliminating its poisonous influence. The revolutionary criticism and repudiation must be combined with various tasks and carried out persistently.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To correctly handle cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-ones, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation in one's own unit. It must be solved. Our Party, through the Yan'an Rectification Movement, educated a large number of cadres, united the entire Party, and ensured the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. This tradition, we must carry it forward." In the new year, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat must strive to help more revolutionary cadres use Mao Zedong Thought to correctly handle relations with the masses and correctly handle relations with themselves, and bravely come forward to revolution. We must develop revolutionary great alliances, unite to oppose the enemy, oppose factional strife without principles, and overcome sectarianism and cliquism. We must vigorously promote the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary committees at all levels, maintain their revolutionary authority, help them improve and develop, and make them play a powerful role in leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

In places where revolutionary committees have been established, we must lead the masses to carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation in their own units. We must reform education, reform literature and art, reform office work and administrative management, and reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. In this reform, we must take Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the guide, break through the resistance of old habits, continue to rely on the broad masses, mobilize the masses, and strongly support revolutionary activists and new things in the revolutionary masses. This is a great revolutionary movement. The Party's leadership must emphasize proletarian politics, focus on overall planning and typical experiments, combine general mobilization with specific guidance, and make the struggle-criticism-transformation on all fronts develop smoothly.

Third, we must rectify the Party's organization and strengthen the Party's construction.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy." This is our great program for rectifying and building the Party.

The great proletarian cultural revolution is a great movement to rectify the Party. In the new year, we must combine the revolutionary criticism and repudiation and the struggle-criticism-transformation in our own units, deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party over the past few decades, deeply study Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the Party, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the Party, and purify and rectify the Party's organization. We must recruit a batch of outstanding advanced elements of the proletariat who have emerged during the cultural revolution into the Party, and expel traitors, spies, and unrepentant power-holders who are taking the capitalist road from the Party. Party members who have made serious mistakes must seriously engage in self-criticism. After this storm of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is becoming even purer, more vigorous, and stronger. The Communist Party of China, led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, and armed with contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be able to complete the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

While rectifying the Party's organization, the Communist Youth League, the Red Guards, and various revolutionary mass organizations must also be rectified in terms of ideology and organization, raise awareness, purify the ranks, affirm achievements, overcome shortcomings, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Whether or not one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a genuine revolutionary of the proletariat in the new situation. The departments of propaganda, culture, education, and other Party and government work departments must regard the establishment of a proletarian class team as a very important task.

Fourth, we must further implement Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, which is an important guarantee for achieving a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The great People's Liberation Army is the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the iron wall defending the socialist motherland, and the strong backing of the great proletarian cultural revolution. They have made great contributions during the cultural revolution. In the new year, they will undertake more and more important tasks. The broad revolutionary masses must believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, support and love the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, help the People's Liberation Army, and be vigilant against bad people who try to sow discord between the military and the civilians. The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must continue to implement the series of principles and policies proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, such as living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, promoting the three-eighths style, carrying forward the three great democracies, and carrying out the four-good company movement, to raise the construction of our army's revolutionization and modernization to a higher level. They must enthusiastically respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the great proletarian cultural revolution movement," further do a good job in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work, and further do a good job in the work of loving the people. They must stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, learn from the masses, and seriously implement the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting the factions," and carry out in-depth, detailed, and patient ideological and political work. All officers and soldiers of the army must be highly vigilant, strengthen preparedness, consolidate national defense, be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, defend our great motherland, and defend the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Fifth, we must seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness.

Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which points out: "The great proletarian cultural revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. It is wrong to oppose the cultural revolution to the development of production." Under the impetus of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the industrial and agricultural production in 1968 will have even greater development. Leaders at all levels must put politics in command, start from promoting the ideological revolution of the people, grasp the production work, and regard it as an important task for achieving an overall victory. The broad revolutionary masses must economize and make revolution, cherish state property, voluntarily strengthen labor discipline, and resolutely criticize and resist the evil winds of counter-revolutionary economism. We must vigorously grasp transportation. We must strengthen and improve the leadership teams at all levels of production. Important production and scientific research departments must quickly establish a strong leadership core to ensure that the industrial and agricultural production in 1968 will have even greater development.

The above are our main tasks. Completing these glorious tasks will require arduous struggle and efforts.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles." The handful of traitors and spies mixed within, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and will not repent, the ghosts and snakes in society (i.e., those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed), as well as the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their running dogs, will never be willing to perish. They will surely adopt various forms to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord, continuing to sabotage and disrupt. In the excellent situation, there will also be some dark corners where the broom does not reach, and the dust does not go away, and we need to continue to expose the cover of class struggle. We must maintain a high sense of class struggle, rely on the revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of the people, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must fully mobilize the masses to thoroughly investigate and resolutely deal with the handful of class enemies who are wildly sabotaging the great proletarian cultural revolution, sabotaging socialist construction, and disrupting social order, both in the background and in the foreground, to ensure the smooth progress of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

We must clearly recognize that the great proletarian cultural revolution not only aims to overthrow the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road but also to solve the problem of people's worldview and to uproot the roots of revisionism. The more the revolution develops, the more deeply it touches people's souls, and the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's "public" and the bourgeoisie's "private" becomes. Only by thoroughly studying and applying the "Old Five Articles" in the midst of intense class struggle, by fighting against the bourgeoisie's "private" and establishing the proletariat's "public," by transforming one's worldview, and by learning to use the method of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to correctly handle contradictions within the people, can one truly follow Chairman Mao and truly become a revolutionary of the proletariat who is determined to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

The brilliant achievements of the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country have greatly inspired all revolutionary people in the world and have dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their running dogs. Their various slanders and libels against the great proletarian cultural revolution in China have been completely overwhelmed by the great victory of the Chinese people and have met with shameful failure. Let those gentlemen go on with their desperate cries! We will continue to unite closely with all Marxist-Leninists in the world and all revolutionary people in the world to carry the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries through to the end and to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great achievements of the Chinese people in the new year will surely further awaken the world.

Comrades, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, be modest and prudent, and continue our efforts. Let us unite as one, work hard, and create new merits for the motherland and the people, to welcome the complete victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Long live the complete victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution!

    迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论
    光辉灿烂的一九六八年来到了。
    东方红，太阳升。在新的一年开始的时候，全国亿万军民怀着无比深厚的阶级感情，衷心祝愿我们的伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的天才领导下，人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，已经在一九六七年取得了决定性的胜利。在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争已经开始了。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命，是一片大好形势。空前广泛和深入的革命群众运动，正沿着毛主席指出的轨道继续向前发展。革命的大批判正在各条战线上进一步展开，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反革命罪行，大量地被人民群众揭露出来，使人们对于巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的重要性，有了更具体、更清楚的认识。各省、市、自治区的革命委员会一个接一个地建立起来。教育革命和各条战线的斗、批、改，正在逐步出现新的面貌。文化大革命带动了各方面的工作，我国导弹、氢弹的试验成功，震动了全世界。农业生产获得空前的大丰收。全国热气腾腾，到处是蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    形势大好最重要的一点是：伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示同广大革命群众见面以后，出现了一个群众性的认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的最新指示的热潮。毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及全国各地，成为活学活用毛泽东思想的学校，成为“斗私，批修”的广阔战场，有力地提高了广大革命干部和革命群众的思想觉悟。革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐大大加快了。革命形势的发展如江河奔泻，完全证实了毛主席在视察时所指出的“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好”的科学预见。
    在新的一年中，全党、全军、全国无产阶级革命派和全国人民，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    为了实现这个伟大的战略目标，摆在我们面前的战斗任务是：
    第一，更加广泛和深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。正象林彪副主席所说的那样：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”新的一年，将是几万万革命人民紧紧掌握毛泽东思想去夺取新的伟大胜利的一年。
    各级领导同志、各革命组织，要大抓狠抓毛泽东思想的教育，大力加强思想政治工作，切实办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。活学活用毛泽东思想，首先就要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示。要使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，使毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策，为广大人民群众所直接掌握，变为亿万革命人民自觉的革命行动。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利最根本的保证。物质变精神，精神变物质。毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    要继续发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。对毛主席著作，对毛主席的最新指示，学了就要用，要深刻领会，坚决照办，经常检查，及时总结。什么人离开了毛主席的指示，违背毛主席的战略部署，自作聪明，正路不走走歪路，就一定会迷失方向，就一定要犯错误。各革命组织，都要以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作为自己行动的唯一指南。凡是违背毛泽东思想的一切言行，无论来自右的方面，或是来自极“左”方面，都要坚决抵制，坚决反对。每一个无产阶级革命战士，都应该成为学习最新指示、执行最新指示、宣传最新指示、捍卫最新指示的模范。
    第二，要继续深入开展革命的大批判，促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入展开各单位、各部门的斗、批、改。
    新的一年中，我们将进一步揭露中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其代理人的罪行，使他们的丑恶面目和阴谋活动现形于光天化日之下，使他们一切复辟的妄想彻底破产。要以毛泽东思想为武器，采取多种形式，在各个领域中狠批修正主义路线，肃清它的流毒。革命的大批判，要结合各项任务，持久地开展下去。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。我们党，经过延安整风，教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。这个传统，我们一定要发扬。”在新的一年里，广大无产阶级革命派要努力帮助更多的革命干部用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命。要发展革命的大联合，团结对敌，反对无原则的派别纠纷，克服小团体主义和宗派主义。要大力促进各级革命委员会的建立和巩固，维护它的革命权威，帮助它的完善和发展，使它在带领广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中发挥强大的威力。
    在已经成立革命委员会的地方，必须领导群众进行本单位的斗、批、改。要改革教育，改革文艺，改革机关工作和行政管理工作，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。在这种改革中，要以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为指针，冲破旧的习惯势力的抵抗，继续依靠广大群众，放手发动群众，大力支持革命的积极分子，支持革命群众中的新生事物。这是一场伟大的革命运动，党的领导要突出无产阶级政治，抓好全面规划、典型试验这两件事，把一般号召同具体指导结合起来，使各条战线的斗、批、改能顺利地向前发展。
    第三，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这是我们整党建党的伟大纲领。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一次伟大的整党运动。在新的一年里，我们要结合革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，深入学习几十年来党内两条路线斗争的历史，深入学习毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，纯洁和整顿党的组织。要吸收一批在文化大革命中涌现出来的优秀的无产阶级先进分子入党，清除叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派出党。犯过严重错误的少数党员，要认真进行自我批评。经过这场无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，正在变得更加纯洁，更加朝气蓬勃，更加坚强。以当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席为领袖的、用当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党，一定能够完成在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大历史使命。
    在整顿党的组织的同时，共青团、红卫兵、各革命群众组织，都应当从思想上、组织上进行整顿，提高觉悟，纯洁队伍，肯定成绩，克服缺点，加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。宣传、文化、教育部门以及其他党、政工作部门，要把建立无产阶级的阶级队伍，当作一项十分重大的任务。
    第四，进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的主要支柱，是保卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城，是无产阶级文化大革命的坚强后盾。他们在文化大革命中作出巨大的贡献。在新的一年中，他们将担负起更多更重要的任务。广大革命群众要更加相信和依靠解放军，拥护和热爱解放军，学习解放军，帮助解放军，警惕坏人挑拨军民团结。人民解放军广大指战员，要继续贯彻执行林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，深入进行两条路线斗争的教育，把我军革命化、现代化的建设提到一个更高的水平。要热烈响应林彪副主席发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，进一步做好爱民工作。要坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，相信和依靠广大革命群众，向群众学习，认真执行“支左不支派”的原则，进行深入、细致、耐心的思想政治工作。全军指战员要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，巩固国防，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    第五，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。把文化大革命同发展生产对立起来，这种看法是不对的。”在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，一九六八年的工农业生产将会有更大的发展。各级领导都要政治挂帅，从促进人的思想革命化入手，抓好生产工作，把它当作夺取全面胜利的一项重要任务。广大革命群众要节约闹革命，爱护国家财产，自觉地加强劳动纪律，坚决批判和抵制反革命经济主义的歪风。要大力抓好交通运输。要健全和加强各级生产领导班子，重要的生产和科研部门，要迅速建立坚强的领导核心，保证一九六八年的工农业生产有更大的发展。
    以上就是我们面临的主要任务。完成这些光荣的任务，要经过艰巨的斗争和努力。
    毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”混在内部的一小撮叛徒、特务，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资本主义道路的当权派，社会上的牛鬼蛇神（即没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右），以及美帝、苏修和他们的走狗，绝不会甘心于自己的灭亡，他们一定还会采取各种形式，造谣诬蔑，挑拨离间，继续进行破坏和捣乱。大好形势下，也会有某些阴暗的角落，扫帚不到，灰尘不走，需要继续揭开阶级斗争的盖子。我们一定要保持高度的阶级斗争观念，依靠广大人民群众的革命警惕性，大力加强无产阶级专政。对一小撮在幕后或幕前猖狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设、扰乱社会治安的阶级敌人，要充分发动群众，彻底查清，坚决处理，保证无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。
    我们必须清楚地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命，不仅要斗倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，而且要解决人们的世界观问题，解决挖掉修正主义根子的问题。革命越向前发展，就越是深刻地触及到人们的灵魂，无产阶级的“公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的冲突就越突出。只有在轰轰烈烈的阶级斗争中大学大用“老五篇”，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，改造世界观，并且学会用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾，才能真正紧跟毛主席，真正成为“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就，给世界上一切革命的人民以极大的鼓舞，给美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和他们的走狗以十分沉重的打击。他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的种种造谣诽谤，已被中国人民伟大胜利的东风完全压倒，遭到了可耻的破产。让那些老爷们去绝望地叫喊吧！我们将继续同全世界马克思列宁主义者紧紧团结在一起，同全世界广大革命人民紧紧团结在一起，把反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，中国人民在新的一年中的伟大成就，必将进一步激醒全世界。
    广大工农群众，人民解放军指战员，红卫兵小将，革命干部和革命知识分子，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，为祖国、为人民创建新的功勋，去迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！
