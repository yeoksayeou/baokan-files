The People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangxi, fighting side by side with the heroic children of Jinggangshan, has hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They love the leftists, support the leftists, and have spread the great voice of Chairman Mao throughout the cities and villages of Jiangxi Province. They have armed thousands and millions of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, seizing decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution, and have established immortal merits. They have produced the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Li Wenzhong, setting a brilliant example for the entire army's "three supports, two militaries" work.

Last July, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province reached the decisive moment of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the People's Liberation Army joined forces with the proletarian revolutionaries represented by the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Masses' Great Alliance Preparatory Committee. They fought side by side, withstood the ferocious counterattacks of the class enemies, and smashed the desperate struggles of the Jiangxi representatives of the Chinese Khrushchev, Fang Zhichun, and other cliques within the party. They protected the broad masses of the leftists and won victory after victory.

Above all, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the most important. With deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad cadres and soldiers vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought. They helped the revolutionary masses study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, turning Mao's brilliant thoughts and specific policies into the conscious revolutionary actions of the broad masses. They countered the evil deeds of the clique within the Jiangxi Party that deceived the masses and blocked Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's series of instructions on the Cultural Revolution. They overcame difficulties, broke through obstacles, and organized large-scale Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They went deep into the streets, factories, institutions, schools, and vast rural areas to vigorously promote Chairman Mao's instructions and specific policies. The unit stationed in Ganzhou and Jian regions posted nearly 500,000 central documents in a short time, reaching over 6 million people. The unit stationed in Fuzhou and Jiujiang regions, and the 2nd Independent Battalion of the Jiangxi Military Region, fearlessly entered deep mountains and old forests, spreading the word door-to-door. A small team from the unit stationed in Shangrao region climbed the mountains at the junction of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces to spread the word to single-family households. Once Mao's voice was spread, it turned into the conscious revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses. The ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces continued to grow, and the deceived masses returned to Mao's revolutionary line one after another. The clique within the party fell into the vast ocean of people's war.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not completed, the party's political tasks cannot be accomplished." The Jiangxi garrison, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively helped the proletarian revolutionaries strengthen ideological and political work. They wholeheartedly won over, educated, and united the deceived masses and cadres who made mistakes. They organized the deceived masses and cadres who made mistakes to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," using "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the guideline, fiercely fighting against "self," and deeply uprooting the roots of revisionism. The unit stationed in Ganzhou organized study classes for the deceived masses, recalling the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; recalling the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and comparing it with the sweetness of Mao's revolutionary line; reflecting on whether they had forgotten their roots and whether they were loyal to Chairman Mao. At the same time, they widely carried out revolutionary criticism, purging the poison of revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. Because the garrison of the People's Liberation Army in Jiangxi Province and the proletarian revolutionaries most firmly executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and most broadly united the broad revolutionary masses and cadres, they greatly promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

In the process of helping to establish revolutionary committees (revolutionary committee preparatory groups) at various levels in Jiangxi Province, the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and the three standards for selecting cadres proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, first helped the revolutionary leftists hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They guided everyone to consciously emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, and carry forward the three-eighths style. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit executing the support-left task in the red revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan, to make the representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in the revolutionary committee preparatory group forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to hold power well and use power well for the proletariat, led them along the revolutionary road Chairman Mao took forty years ago to Jinggangshan. They carried backpacks and marched on foot to places like Ciping, Daping, and Maoping to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously carrying out the struggle against self and criticism of revisionism, and doing a good job in the revolutionization of thought. A large number of new cadres who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution grew rapidly, and the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works became even more diligent. They led the broad revolutionary masses to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire province better and better.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装千千万万革命群众
    江西驻军在文化大革命中建立新功勋
    指战员满怀深厚的阶级感情，用各种形式把毛主席的伟大声音最迅速最深入地传播到群众中去，同无产阶级革命派团结战斗在一起，摧毁了江西一小撮走资派的垂死挣扎，实现了全省革命大联合，促进了革命三结合，全省革命和生产形势越来越好
    据新华社南昌七日电　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，与英雄的井冈山儿女并肩战斗的中国人民解放军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热爱左派，支持左派，把伟大领袖毛主席的指示传遍了江西省的城镇山村，从思想上武装了千千万万无产阶级革命派和革命群众，夺取了文化大革命的决定性胜利，立下了不朽的功勋，涌现出“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠，为全军“三支”“两军”工作，树立了光辉榜样。
    去年七月，当江西省的无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，人民解放军同以江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会为代表的无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，顶住了阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人方志纯等党内一小撮走资派的垂死挣扎，保护了左派广大群众，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    千重要，万重要，用毛泽东思想武装群众最重要。广大指战员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，大力宣传毛泽东思想，帮助革命群众学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的指示，使毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策，变为广大群众自觉的革命行动。他们针对江西省党内一小撮走资派蒙蔽群众，封锁毛主席和党中央有关文化大革命一系列指示的罪恶行径，排除困难，冲破障碍，组织大批毛泽东思想宣传队，深入街头、工厂、机关、学校和广大农村，大力宣传毛主席的指示和各项具体政策。驻赣州、吉安地区某部在很短时间内，张贴中央文件近五十万份，接受宣传的群众达六百多万人次。驻抚州、九江地区某部和江西省军区独立二营广大指战员不怕山高路远，深入深山老林，挨家挨户宣传。驻上饶地区某部一个小分队，登上赣闽浙三省交界的山区，向单村独户人家进行宣传。毛主席的声音一经传播，就变为革命群众自觉的革命行动。无产阶级革命派队伍不断发展壮大，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷回到毛主席的革命路线上来。党内一小撮走资派陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”江西驻军遵照毛主席的教导，积极帮助无产阶级革命派加强思想政治工作，满腔热情地争取、教育、团结受蒙蔽群众和犯错误的干部。他们组织受蒙蔽群众和犯错误的干部，参加毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗“私”字，狠挖修正主义根子。驻赣州部队某部针对受蒙蔽群众的活思想，在学习班里，一起忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席革命路线的甜；对照自己是否忘了本，是否忠于毛主席。同时，广泛开展了革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义流毒。由于驻省人民解放军和无产阶级革命派最坚定地执行了毛主席的最新指示，最广泛地团结了广大革命群众和干部，大大促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    在帮助江西省各级成立革命委员会（革命委员会筹备小组）的过程中，解放军指战员遵照毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件和林副主席提出的选拔干部的三条标准，广大指战员首先帮助革命左派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置，并引导大家自觉地突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风。在红色革命根据地井冈山地区执行支左任务的某部指战员，为了让革命委员会筹备小组中的革命群众组织代表，象革命老前辈那样永远忠于毛主席，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，带领他们沿着毛主席四十年前上井冈山的革命道路，背上背包，徒步行军，到茨坪、大井、茅坪等地去办毛泽东思想学习班，大力开展斗私批修，搞好思想革命化。大批在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命新干部迅速成长，活学活用毛主席著作更加努力。他们带领广大革命群众贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使全省革命和生产形势越来越好。
