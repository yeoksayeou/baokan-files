According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 22: The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee has mobilized the masses across all systems, departments, and fronts to summarize the experiences of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They regard running Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the most important measure to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Currently, the entire city is experiencing a surge in the movement to further expand and improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented.

After the New Year, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across various fronts in Tianjin, in accordance with the requirements of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, launched a mass movement to summarize the experiences of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through numerous vivid facts, they deeply realized that to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it is necessary to thoroughly overcome factionalism from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. They said, if one is entangled by this poisonous snake of factionalism, one will only emphasize the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in other organizations and by other people, but not in one's own organization and oneself; one will only stop at words, but not implement them in one's own thoughts and actions. Through summarizing, the revolutionary masses have raised their awareness and consciousness. They said they must establish a revolutionary learning style that combines theory with practice, learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely overcome factionalism from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, eliminate personal interests for public interests, and unconditionally and faithfully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their thoughts and actions. They said, doing so is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through mass summarization, the entire city has seen a surge in the movement to further expand and improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The city has established over three thousand new Mao Zedong Thought study classes, bringing the total number of study classes to over sixteen thousand. The number of revolutionary masses and cadres participating in the study classes has increased from nearly seven hundred thousand at the end of last year to over eight hundred thousand. In the study classes, the revolutionary masses learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, speaking and acting in a down-to-earth manner, step by step, effectively consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and promoting the revolutionary tripartite alliance. The thousands of salt workers in Tianjin's Tanggu Salt Field were previously divided into two major factions. Due to factionalism, although they united, the unity was not solid. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the People's Liberation Army Navy stationed at the field, they ran Mao Zedong Thought study classes, first correcting their attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and repeatedly studying and understanding the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The salt workers repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Through studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the two factions solidified their revolutionary great alliance at the ideological level.

Many revolutionary masses in revolutionary mass organizations, in the study classes, learned the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary tripartite alliance, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." They actively and enthusiastically helped revolutionary cadres who made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, encouraging them to stand up for the revolution, greatly promoting the revolutionary tripartite alliance.

To further promote the work of expanding and improving Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" in Tianjin held a "Learn from Advanced Experiences, Launch a New Surge in Expanding Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes" mobilization meeting on January 17. Yang Yinsheng, a standing committee member of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee and a responsible person from the garrison, pointed out at the meeting that whether to expand or not to expand Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a major issue related to whether Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be fully implemented. All levels of leadership and every Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army must regard helping the masses to expand Mao Zedong Thought study classes as their primary task. The top leaders at all levels must personally take charge and establish specialized teams to strengthen leadership. With the greatest determination, the greatest perseverance, and the fastest speed, they must turn all factories, rural areas, shops, offices, schools, and neighborhoods in the city into red Mao Zedong Thought universities.

    发动群众总结办毛泽东思想学习班经验
    天津市革命委员会要求进一步办好学习班落实毛主席最新指示
    据新华社天津二十二日电　天津市革命委员会在全市各系统、各部门、各条战线广泛地发动群众，总结办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，把办好毛泽东思想学习班作为全面落实毛主席最新指示的最重要的措施。现在，全市出现了进一步大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。
    元旦过后，天津市各条战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命群众就根据天津市革命委员会的要求，展开了群众性的总结办好毛泽东思想学习班经验的活动。他们从无数活生生的事实中深刻地认识到，要办好毛泽东思想学习班，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，必须彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。他们说，被派性这条毒蛇缠住了身，对毛主席的最新指示就会只强调在别的组织和别人身上落实，而不强调在自己的组织和自己身上落实；就会只停留在口头上，而不落实在自己的思想上和行动上。广大革命群众通过总结，提高了认识，提高了觉悟。他们说，一定要建立理论联系实际的革命学风，对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，破私立公，无条件地、不折不扣地把毛主席的最新指示落实在自己的思想上和行动上。他们说，这样做，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最大的忠。
    通过群众性的大总结，全市出现了进一步大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。全市各条战线新办起的毛泽东思想学习班就有三千多个，使全市的学习班达到一万六千多个，参加学习的革命群众、革命干部由去年年底的近七十万人增加到八十多万人。广大革命群众在学习班里对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，说了就做，扎扎实实，一步一个脚印，有力地巩固了革命大联合，促进了革命三结合。天津塘沽盐场的几千名盐工，过去分成了两大派。由于派性作怪，虽然联合了，但是不巩固。他们在驻场的人民解放军海军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，首先端正对毛主席最新指示的态度，反复学习和领会毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。盐工们对毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，反复地进行学习和讨论。通过在毛泽东思想学习班的学习，两派组织从思想上巩固了革命的大联合。
    很多革命群众组织的战士，在学习班里学习了伟大领袖毛主席“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的教导，积极热情地帮助犯有错误的革命干部认识错误，改正错误，促使他们站出来革命，大大地促进了革命的三结合。
    为了更加有力地推动大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的工作，战斗在天津“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，十七日举行了“学习先进经验，掀起大办毛泽东思想学习班新高潮誓师动员大会”。天津市革命委员会常委、驻津部队负责人杨银声在会上指出，大办还是不大办毛泽东思想学习班，是关系到毛主席的最新指示能不能条条落实、全面落实的大问题，各级领导和每一个解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，都要把帮助群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，当作首要任务。各级领导的第一把手要亲自抓，并建立专门的班子，加强领导。要用最大的决心，最大的毅力，最快的速度，把全市的工厂、农村、商店、机关、学校、街道，都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
