A reporting team from Guangdong Province, consisting of comrades who participated in a study session in Beijing, has returned to the province to report on their learning outcomes. They bring the teachings of Chairman Mao to the 40 million people of Guangdong, and by overcoming factionalism and strengthening party spirit, they have promoted revolutionary unity across the province.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 21st, a reporting team from Guangdong Province, which participated in a study session on Mao Zedong Thought in Beijing, has returned to Guangdong. They bring the joyous news of having seen our great leader Chairman Mao, the battle orders and warm instructions from the proletarian headquarters, and the rich fruits and valuable experiences of their active learning and application of Chairman Mao's latest directives. They have recently returned to Guangdong to report to the 40 million people of the province, greatly inspiring the people of the province and promoting the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives across the province.

Under the leadership of the reporting team, a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives has swiftly swept across Guangdong. The tide of revolutionary unity across the province surges forward. Currently, nearly 60 counties and cities in the province have achieved revolutionary unity or reached agreements for unity. Some prefectures, counties, and cities have also established revolutionary committee preparatory groups. Revolutionary masses praise the reporting team as a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, a guidance team for learning Chairman Mao's latest directives, a model team for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and a work team for promoting revolutionary unity.

This reporting team consists of 80 comrades, most of whom are leaders of revolutionary mass organizations from various regions of Guangdong. They were entrusted by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to go to Beijing to participate in the study session on Mao Zedong Thought. During their stay in Beijing, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directives and the warm care of the central leaders, they took "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, conducted serious self-criticism, overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieved revolutionary unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought among the representatives of the two factions studying in Beijing.

On December 31 of last year, they were fortunate to be received by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. This is the greatest encouragement, support, education, and motivation for the revolutionary people of the entire province of Guangdong. The representatives, bringing the joyous news of Chairman Mao's excellent health, and Chairman Mao's warm care, immediately returned to Guangdong on January 5 to report to the 40 million people of the province. When they spoke to the revolutionary masses in Guangdong about their moving encounter with Chairman Mao, the people repeatedly shouted in enthusiastic acclaim: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The comrades of the reporting team, following Chairman Mao's latest directives, openly criticized and repudiated themselves during the reporting meetings, sincerely conducted self-criticism, bravely overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and sparked a revolution in their souls. The representatives of the reporting team, who had returned to their respective regions, were originally leaders of the two factions' mass organizations in those areas. After studying in Beijing, they unified their thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, eliminated barriers, and strengthened unity. During the reporting meetings, they walked onto the stage hand in hand, reporting to the revolutionary masses of the two factions their experiences of criticizing and repudiating revisionism in the presence of Chairman Mao. They focused on the fundamental issue of their attitudes towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and Chairman Mao's series of latest directives during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They fiercely criticized the "self" and touched their souls. Whenever the representatives spoke of past mistakes due to selfishness and factionalism, they sincerely apologized to the other side on the spot and shouted slogans of learning from the other side. Their courage in self-criticism and daring to engage in sharp struggle gave great inspiration and education to the broad revolutionary masses. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, after hearing the report of the reporting team, immediately ran onto the stage to conduct self-criticism, and some found the other side immediately after the meeting to sincerely conduct self-criticism.

The two factions of revolutionary masses in Zhaoqing originally had severe antagonistic sentiments. After hearing the report of the reporting team, they immediately criticized and repudiated themselves, conducted self-criticism, and quickly reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary unity.

Wherever the reporting team went, they brought the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao. They were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives as soon as they learned them, with immediate results. Revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses across the province expressed their determination to be like the reporting team, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives without any deviation, to ensure that they are fully implemented, and not to have one face in front and another behind, to say one thing and do another. They are determined to be true proletarian revolutionaries.

To quickly spread the voice of Chairman Mao and the experiences of criticizing and repudiating revisionism brought back by the reporting team from Beijing to various counties, districts, and grassroots units, and to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest directives are fully implemented, many regions sent the recordings of the reporting team's reports back to the counties and districts for immediate playback. After hearing the report of the reporting team, representatives from various places in Huizhou immediately formed several small teams to go deep into the counties, districts, and communes, propagating Chairman Mao's latest directives, conveying the reporting situation of the reporting team, sharing their experiences of learning from the reporting team, and promoting the swift achievement of revolutionary unity in the 13 counties and cities under this region.

Under the leadership of the reporting team, the tide of revolutionary unity in Guangdong Province surges forward, wave upon wave. The reporting team has successfully completed its mission of reporting to the people of the province and has now returned to Beijing to continue participating in the study session on Mao Zedong Thought.

    广东省在京参加学习班的同志回省汇报学习成果
    把毛主席的教导带给四千万人民
    打倒派性增强党性推动了全省革命大联合
    据新华社广州二十一日电　广东省到北京参加毛泽东思想学习班学习的同志组成的一个回省汇报团，带着幸福地见到我们伟大领袖毛主席的特大喜讯，带着无产阶级司令部的战斗号令和亲切教导，带着他们活学活用毛主席最新指示的丰硕成果和宝贵经验，最近回到广东向全省四千万人民汇报，给全省人民很大的鼓舞，促进了毛主席最新指示在全省的全面落实。
    在汇报团的推动下，一个大学习、大宣传、大贯彻毛主席最新指示的热潮在广东各地迅速掀起，全省革命大联合的浪潮滚滚向前。目前，全省近六十个县、市的群众组织已实现革命大联合或达成大联合协议，有些专区、县、市还建立了革命委员会筹备小组。广大革命群众赞扬汇报团是毛泽东思想的宣传队，是学习毛主席最新指示的辅导队，是斗私批修的示范队，是促进革命大联合的工作队。
    这个汇报团共有八十位同志，大部分是广东各地区革命群众组织的负责人。他们受无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的委托，到北京参加毛泽东思想学习班学习。在京学习期间，他们在毛主席最新指示的感召下，在中央首长的亲切关怀下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，进行认真的自我批评，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在毛泽东思想基础上，两派在京学习代表实现了革命大联合。
    去年十二月三十一日，他们幸福地受到伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的接见，这是对广东全省革命人民的最大鼓舞，最大支持，最大教育，最大鞭策。代表们带着伟大领袖毛主席身体非常健康的特大喜讯，带着毛主席的亲切关怀，立即在一月五日赶回广东，向全省四千万人民汇报。当他们在广东各地向革命群众讲到他们幸福地见到毛主席的动人情景时，人们一次又一次地热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    汇报团同志遵循毛主席的最新指示，在汇报会上亮私、斗私，诚恳地多做自我批评，勇敢地打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在灵魂深处爆发革命。回到各地去的汇报团的代表，原来都是那个地区两派群众组织的头头。他们经过在北京的学习，用毛泽东思想统一了认识，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。在汇报大会上，他们非常亲切地手拉着手，走上讲台，向两派革命群众汇报自己在毛主席身边斗私批修的体会。他们抓住在无产阶级文化大革命中对毛主席革命路线，对毛主席的伟大战略部署，对毛主席一系列最新指示的态度这个根本问题，狠斗“私”字，狠触灵魂。每当代表们谈到过去由于私字和派性作怪，作了对不起对方的事情的时候，便当场诚恳地向对方道歉，并高呼向对方学习的口号。他们勇于自我批评，敢于刺刀见红的革命精神，给广大革命群众很大的启发和教育。不少革命群众组织负责人听完汇报团汇报，当场跑上讲台做自我批评，有的会后立即找到对方，诚恳地进行自我批评。
    肇庆地区两派革命群众组织原来对立情绪很严重。他们听了汇报团的报告后，立即亮私斗私，各自多做自我批评，很快达成实现革命大联合的协议。
    汇报团走到那里，就把毛主席倡导的革命好学风带到那里。他们无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，对毛主席最新指示学了就用，立竿见影。全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众纷纷表示，要象汇报团那样，无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的最新指示不折不扣地条条落实、全面落实，决不当面一套，背后一套，讲一套，做一套，决心做真正的无产阶级革命派。
    为了让汇报团从北京带回来的毛主席的声音和斗私批修的经验迅速传达到各县、区和基层单位，让毛主席的最新指示更快地条条落实、全面落实，很多地区把汇报团的报告录音连夜送回各县、区播放。惠阳地区各地代表听了汇报团的汇报以后，立即组成几个小分队深入县、区、公社，宣传毛主席最新指示，传达汇报团汇报情况，介绍他们向汇报团学习的体会，推动了这个地区所属十三个县、市迅速实现了革命大联合。
    在汇报团推动下，广东省革命大联合的洪流滚滚向前，一浪高过一浪。汇报团胜利地完成了向全省人民汇报的任务，现在已返回北京继续参加毛泽东思想学习班学习。
