The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Steel) have fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, treating "seizing the revolution and promoting production" as an important task for achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the beginning of the brilliant year 1968, they have entered the wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production with high fighting posture, enthusiastic political passion, and boundless revolutionary spirit. In the first half of January, the average daily output of major products such as steel ingots and steel materials has increased significantly compared to December last year, and the quality has been significantly improved, thus firing the first shot for the greater development of steel production this year.

Since the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and PLA Daily was published, Anshan Steel immediately launched a large-scale study and propaganda campaign. The PLA propaganda team stationed at Anshan Steel and many leaders of revolutionary committees and heads of revolutionary mass organizations, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, went deep into the workshops, blast furnaces, and open-hearth furnaces to study and discuss the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers. The more they study, the more ardent their revolutionary spirit becomes, and the more resolute their fighting will becomes. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers have expressed their determination to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practical actions and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary cadres and workers of the Second Steel Plant, who have made significant contributions to the smelting of alloy steel for the country, have shown great revolutionary spirit and high responsibility for work since the beginning of this year. They have pursued technical excellence and successfully smelted a new type of high-quality alloy steel that the country urgently needs on January 4th, adding a new steel variety to China's steel industry. The revolutionary cadres and workers of the initial rolling mill, inspired by the New Year's editorial, have continuously created new records in steel billet production since this year, pushing production to a new height. The revolutionary cadres and workers of Gongzhuling Iron Mine, known as the "Red Flag of the Iron Mountain," are full of spirit and enthusiasm under the leadership of the mine revolutionary committee. They have completed more than 10% above the planned iron concentrate production in the first decade of this year.

To achieve greater development in steel production this year, Anshan Steel's mining, coking, transportation, mechanical, and power departments have completed a series of preparatory work as early as the fourth quarter of last year. The revolutionary cadres and workers of Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine have moved forward the large-scale ore blasting, originally planned for May this year, to December last year, preparing more "grain" for blast furnace production. On the eve of the New Year, a large number of coal from coal mines across the country arrived to support Anshan Steel. According to the usual practice, it would take a month to unload. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers on the transportation front of Anshan Steel, together with the workers of various factories and the PLA stationed in the factory, formed a coal unloading strike force. Despite the severe cold, they fought day and night and completed the coal unloading task in just seven days, making a contribution to Anshan Steel's production.

Since this year, under the help of the PLA's support-left teams, Anshan Steel's various factories and mines have further improved and strengthened the production leadership teams at all levels. A large number of revolutionary leaders with rich production leadership experience have participated in production leadership, and the broad revolutionary cadres and masses have actively supported their work. Many revolutionary cadres have seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, correctly treated the masses, correctly treated themselves, dared to speak what should be said, dared to do what should be done, and dared to manage what should be managed. This is also an important factor in ensuring the development of production this year.

	This is the PLA propaganda team stationed in Anshan promoting Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel, promoting the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, and encouraging workers to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, break the waves, and move forward.

    积极抓革命促生产为夺取文化大革命全面胜利立新功
    鞍钢打响今年钢铁生产第一炮
    一月份前半月，钢锭钢材等主要产品的平均日产量比去年十二月有较大幅度增加，质量显著改善
    新华社鞍山十六日电 鞍钢广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把“抓革命，促生产”当作夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一项重要任务，在光辉灿烂的一九六八年一开始，就以高昂的战斗姿态，饱满的政治热情，冲天的革命干劲，投入了抓革命，促生产的热潮。今年一月前半个月，钢锭、钢材等主要产品的平均日产量比去年十二月有较大幅度的增加，质量也有显著改善，从而打响了今年钢铁生产更大发展的第一炮。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论一发表，鞍钢立刻出现声势浩大的学习和宣传活动。解放军驻鞍钢毛泽东思想宣传队和许多厂矿革委会领导成员、革命群众组织负责人，以最大的革命热情，深入到车间里、高炉前和平炉旁，同工人一起反复学习，深入讨论落实毛主席的最新指示。大家越学革命精神越旺盛，越学战斗意志越坚强。广大革命职工表示，决心以实际行动全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
    为国家冶炼合金钢做出显著贡献的第二炼钢厂的革命职工，今年一开始，发扬大无畏的革命精神，对工作高度负责，对技术精益求精，在一月四日成功地炼出了一炉国家急需的从未炼过的新型优质合金钢，为我国钢铁工业又增添了一个新钢种。初轧厂革命职工在元旦社论的鼓舞下，今年以来钢坯产量不断创造新纪录，使生产上升到一个新的高度。被人誉为“铁山红旗”的弓长岭铁矿的革命职工，在矿革命委员会领导下意气风发，干劲十足，他们今年一月上旬完成的铁精矿产量超过了计划百分之十以上。
    为了夺取今年钢铁生产的更大发展，鞍钢的矿山、焦化、运输、机械和动力部门，早在去年第四季度就做好了一系列的准备工作。樱桃园铁矿革命职工，将原计划今年五月才进行的矿石大爆破抢前在去年十二月就进行，给高炉生产准备了更多的
  “粮食”。元旦前夕，全国各地煤矿支援鞍钢的煤炭大批运到，按照常规要一个月才能卸完。鞍钢运输战线上的广大革命职工同各厂职工和驻厂解放军同志一起，组成了一支突击卸煤大军，不畏严寒，日夜奋战，只七天时间就攻下了卸煤大关，为鞍钢生产做出了贡献。
    今年以来，鞍钢各厂矿在解放军支左部队的帮助下，进一步健全和加强了各级生产领导班子。大批富有领导生产经验的革命领导干部参加了生产领导，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众积极支持他们的工作。许多革命干部认真学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，该说的敢说，该做的敢做，该管的敢管。这也是保证今年生产发展的一个重要因素。（附图片）
    这是鞍山驻军毛泽东思想宣传队在向鞍钢革命工人宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传文化大革命的大好形势，鼓舞工人紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，乘风破浪向前进。
