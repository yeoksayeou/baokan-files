Members Loyal to Chairman Mao Enthusiastically Sell Patriotic Grain

Jilin Province Exceeds Grain Procurement Target by 11 Percent

According to Xinhua News Agency from Changchun, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural people's communes of Jilin Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the grain procurement target for the state last year. By the end of last December, the total amount of grain handed over to the state in the entire province exceeded the original plan by more than 11 percent, making it the year with the highest grain procurement in Jilin Province in nearly seven years. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the year when agriculture achieved a bumper harvest in Jilin Province, the broad masses of commune members, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," held extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and other series of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as "exploitation has its merits," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and others. Their class consciousness has been greatly enhanced. Many poor and lower-middle peasants regard handing over grain to the state as an expression of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They say: "Procured grain is patriotic grain, political grain, and grain of victory in class struggle. We must sell more grain and good grain to support the nationwide Cultural Revolution and support the socialist construction of the motherland."

In the process of completing the grain procurement task last year, relevant departments and local support troops in various places of Jilin Province followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They strengthened political and ideological work, fully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on grain work, and greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in handing over grain.

    社员忠于毛主席  踊跃交售爱国粮
    吉林省超额百分之十一完成去年国家粮食征购任务
    据新华社长春电　吉林省农村人民公社广大贫下中农社员和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，提前超额完成了去年国家粮食征购任务。到去年十二月下旬的统计，全省已经交售给国家的粮食，超过原计划的百分之十一以上，是吉林省近七年来向国家交售粮食最多的一年。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命运动的丰硕成果。
    去年农业获得大丰收的吉林省农村广大社员，在毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示鼓舞下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展了革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”和其他一系列反革命修正主义谬论，阶级觉悟有了很大提高。许多贫下中农社员把向国家交售粮食，看作是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的表现。他们说：“征购粮是爱国粮，政治粮，阶级斗争胜利粮”、“咱们一定要多售粮，售好粮，支援全国文化大革命，支援祖国的社会主义建设。”
    在完成去年粮食征购工作的过程中，吉林省各地的有关部门和各地支农部队遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，加强政治思想工作，全面贯彻毛主席有关粮食工作的指示，大大提高了广大社员交售粮食的积极性。
