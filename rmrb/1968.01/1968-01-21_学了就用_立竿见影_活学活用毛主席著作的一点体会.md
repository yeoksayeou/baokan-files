Title: Learn and Apply Immediately — Some Reflections on the Active Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works

Many comrades have asked me to share my experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. In truth, I have only just begun reading Chairman Mao's books, and my experiences are limited. If I were to share any insights, the most profound one would be: learn and apply immediately, with visible results.

Learning and applying with class sentiment

In the old society, my family, spanning three generations, worked for landlords and begged for food. In 1948, the People's Liberation Army, led by Chairman Mao, liberated my hometown. The poor in our village overthrew the landlords and stood up. From the experiences of my family and our village being liberated, I genuinely appreciate the Communist Party and love our great leader, Chairman Mao. Before enlisting, I had already made a secret vow: "Niàn Sìwàng, do not forget, do not forget the bitterness of the past, do not forget the sweetness of liberation today."

After enlisting, the works of Chairman Mao that I read the most were the "Three Constantly Read Articles"; I memorized the phrases "completely" and "thoroughly" from "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and the two "extremes" from "Serve the People." However, in the beginning, I did not truly understand them, let alone apply them. This was because I felt that being assigned to the engineering corps, working with stones, bricks, and mud every day, was a bitter and tedious job. I thought it would be more enjoyable and promising to be a technical soldier. In other words, at that time, I had not yet used Mao Zedong Thought to transform my soul.

Later, through repeated readings of Chairman Mao's books and class education, I began to think more deeply. Originally, in the evil old society, it was not just my family or our village's poor who starved and toiled to death, but thousands and thousands of class brothers. The world is full of darkness. Those who exploited us were not just the landlords who harmed my family, but the entire class of landlords and bourgeoisie. Who saved thousands and thousands of laboring people from the bitter pit of suffering? It was our beloved great leader, Chairman Mao. By what power did the laboring people overthrow the three great mountains that pressed down on them? It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is concentrated in the books written by Chairman Mao and embodied in every new directive issued by Chairman Mao. Only at this moment did I truly realize: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of laboring people worldwide, and Chairman Mao's books are the magical weapon for the thorough liberation of revolutionary people worldwide. Now, most laboring people in the world are still suffering. They have not escaped the bitter days like my family's past. We, the liberated people, have the duty and responsibility to support them. With what can we support them? The most powerful weapon is Chairman Mao's works; the most reliable guarantee is to arm our minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After this, I truly began to understand Chairman Mao's books! I felt that one could go a day or two without eating, but one could not go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books. As a glorious soldier of the People's Liberation Army, whether or not to read Chairman Mao's books is not just a matter of personal progress, but a matter of whether one can do a good job in the revolution and contribute to the world revolution.

Thus, my class sentiment towards Chairman Mao's works deepened. I truly understood: parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao; the river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness; the sky is vast, the earth is vast, but not as vast as the power of Mao Zedong Thought.

After this, when I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," I could understand and apply them more. I no longer looked down on the work of the engineering corps but saw my work as a very glorious and important post. I voluntarily treated the construction site as a battlefield. Although we are not facing the American aggressors with bayonets, can't moving one more stone and adding one more brick be like eliminating one more enemy on the battlefield? If we complete the engineering tasks assigned by our superiors quickly, efficiently, and economically, aren't we supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle, striking down the counter-revolutionary arrogance of modern revisionism and reactionaries of all countries, and directly supporting the world revolution? With this thought, the teachings of Chairman Mao that I had learned were applied, and I felt invigorated!

It was also because of this that when I was injured by a train and hospitalized, with my memory impaired, I could still recognize our red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts, and recite Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should be modest, prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people..."

My experience is: Chairman Mao's books are the books of the proletariat, the books of revolution. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, first with class sentiment in learning, and with class sentiment in applying. Only with class sentiment in learning can we understand, and only with class sentiment in applying can we apply.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest walker of the capitalist road within the party, as well as the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, fiercely opposed our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. They slandered our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works as "formalism" and "excessive taxation." These nonsense statements actually prove from the opposite side that active study and application of Chairman Mao's works require deep proletarian sentiment. "There is no love or hate without reason in the world." Every article written by Chairman Mao and every new directive issued during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are to educate and guide the revolutionary masses to make revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev clique, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, how could they understand the profound class sentiment of proletarian revolutionary fighters for Chairman Mao's books? How could they not hate and fear our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially the emphasis on the "application"?

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The more the Chinese Khrushchev clique and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries oppose our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study with deep class sentiment and apply with strong class sentiment. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all harmful elements and build a red world of Mao Zedong Thought!

Learning and applying in struggle

Having class sentiment in learning is the fundamental way to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well. However, this does not mean that having proletarian sentiment in learning and applying will eliminate all contradictions and perfectly combine learning with application. My experience is: learning and applying often have a certain distance. Learning does not necessarily mean applying. To combine learning with applying, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to fight and make revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought as the arrow to hit the target of our thoughts and objective reality.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, apart from external enemies, the most dangerous enemy and the biggest hidden danger is the handful of agents of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party. They are the main objects of our struggle. Our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, fundamentally, is to overthrow this handful of bad elements and all the ghosts and snakes within the country, and to overthrow the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries internationally. To overthrow the domestic and international class enemies, we must overthrow the enemies in our minds. On October 1, 1966, I personally heard Vice Chairman Lin transmit the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism at Tiananmen Square, and I was extremely moved at that moment. Chairman Mao's new directive set the fundamental line for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reflecting the fundamental demand of the people of our country and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, "These two things are interconnected. Only by thoroughly fighting selfishness can we better carry the struggle against revisionism to the end." My experience is: reading Chairman Mao's books without fiercely fighting selfishness means we cannot study or apply Chairman Mao's books well. Only by constantly fighting selfishness in our minds can we gradually combine learning with applying, and more powerfully strike the enemy, ensuring that our red regime will never change color.

Once, while performing a construction task, I encountered danger, and a thought of fearing death flashed through my mind: should I advance or retreat? At that moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than the Taihang Mountains," and the shining examples of Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune. I realized that selfishness had surfaced. Although I had studied the teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, I had not internalized it nor truly applied it. The result of the struggle was that "publicness" pushed back selfishness. Chairman Mao's teachings inspired me to complete the task victoriously. Another time, I participated in carrying sleepers. Upon seeing such a large pile, a thought immediately flashed through my mind: "When will we finish carrying these sleepers?" Naturally, my spirit was dampened. At that moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's story of the old fool who moved mountains in "Qu Feng Yi Shan." The value of the spirit of the old fool lies in his fearlessness of difficulties, daring to struggle, and daring to win. I studied "Qu Feng Yi Shan," but I still feared hardship and laziness, being intimidated by this pile of sleepers. Could this be called following Chairman Mao's words? I realized that this was selfishness surfacing again, a separation of learning from applying. I immediately fought against the thoughts of fearing hardship and laziness in my mind. Thus, my spirit quickly revived. I shouted loudly: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." I picked up sleeper after sleeper and ran swiftly.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system are always lingering in people's minds and are unwilling to leave easily." Although I come from a poor family and grew up under the red flag, the influence of the old society's ideas on me is undeniable. My own experience proves: studying "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" without criticizing individualism means one cannot establish the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people; studying "Qu Feng Yi Shan" without fighting against the thoughts of fearing hardship and laziness, and craving comfort, means one cannot "with determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" when encountering enemies and difficulties. Similarly, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, if we revolutionary factions study Chairman Mao's series of new directives on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but do not fight selfishness in our minds and struggle against factionalism and small-groupism, we cannot continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, promote and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and deeply carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation. In short, we cannot implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and cannot follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Whether or not one can fiercely fight selfishness is a matter of loving or not loving our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; it is a matter of following or not following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; it is a matter of the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works are all for the public good. With selfishness, one cannot infinitely love Chairman Mao, cannot do as Chairman Mao says, and cannot be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Vice Chairman Lin instructed: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be carried out well." Every bit of progress I have made on the road to thought revolutionization is the result of using Mao Zedong Thought to fight selfishness in my mind. To study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, to solve the contradiction between learning and applying, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the fundamental issue, and fighting selfishness is the key.

Learning a little, applying a little, repeatedly learning, repeatedly applying

After reading Chairman Mao's books, one must apply them, focusing on the "application." However, Chairman Mao's books are extremely rich in content and deeply profound in thought. We ordinary soldiers, limited by our level of awareness, practical experience, and work positions, can generally only learn a part. I myself, with my utmost effort, can only learn a little. Moreover, it is often the case that after reading a sentence of Chairman Mao or hearing a new directive from Chairman Mao, I still cannot immediately understand or consciously follow closely. This is also a practical contradiction. To solve this contradiction, my experience is: to learn a little, apply a little, repeatedly learn, and repeatedly apply.

Food is eaten bite by bite, and studying Chairman Mao's works is also done bit by bit. Taking the "Three Constantly Read Articles," for example, I first studied "Serve the People." In this article, there are a few important points. The first ones I learned and applied were the points of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and "to die for the people's interests is heavier than the Taihang Mountains." After tasting the sweetness of application, I then learned the points of serving the people, not fearing criticism for shortcomings, and others. Chairman Mao's teachings gave me boundless strength, enabling me to face danger fearlessly for the revolutionary cause and to constantly fight against the slightest selfish thoughts. Today, learn a little and apply a little; tomorrow, learn a little and apply a little. Over time, it is very natural to connect many points into a piece, and what is learned and applied will be more.

Chairman Mao's words are great truths. Only by repeatedly learning and repeatedly applying can one truly understand and apply them, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root in one's mind. I have experienced: do not be afraid of not knowing how to apply, but be afraid of not applying. As long as one repeatedly learns and repeatedly applies, the more one applies, the deeper one understands, the greater the effect, and one can continuously promote thought revolutionization. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and effective weapon for transforming the soul. However, the selfishness in our own minds is not something that can be completely solved by fighting once or twice, but must be repeatedly learned and applied with targeting, so that "publicness" can ultimately overcome "selfishness." After I did something beneficial to the people, the party and the people gave me high honors. Wherever I went, comrades praised me. Hearing more applause, I developed the thought of preserving my honor. Sometimes I became overly cautious and did not dare to speak much, fearing that I might say something wrong and have a bad influence; sometimes I did not dare to expose my shortcomings as freely as before, fearing that others would know and it would look bad; sometimes thoughts of my own learning being quite good also flashed through my mind. Aiming at these bad thoughts in my mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should be modest, prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people," "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth." In the past half year, the organization has sent me to more than twenty or thirty places to learn from the experiences of brother units and share my learning experiences. Every time I went to a place, I repeatedly studied a few times Chairman Mao's above teachings. Thus, my thoughts of preserving honor and the hidden arrogance in my heart were overcome time and time again, and in promoting thought revolutionization, I made progress day by day.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has issued a series of extremely important new directives. For every proletarian revolutionary fighter, it is necessary to learn a little and apply a little of Chairman Mao's new directives. Study them earnestly, apply them earnestly, repeatedly learn, and repeatedly apply, ensuring that every directive is implemented and every sentence is followed. In this regard, because of my severe cranial injury, my objective conditions are somewhat limited, and compared to other comrades, there is a significant gap. However, I have made this resolution: my body is injured, but my mind is not; my body is forced to rest, but my mind must not rest. Severe cranial injuries cannot block my loyalty to the revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao; physical inability to move freely cannot obstruct my following the great strategic deployment of our great commander Chairman Mao.

The New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and Liberation Army Daily pointed out: "The more the revolution advances, the more it deeply touches people's souls, and the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's 'publicness' and the bourgeoisie's 'selfishness' becomes." The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in the revolutionary ranks is the concentrated manifestation of 'selfishness.' It sometimes interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right, and sometimes from the ultra-left, and is even used by class enemies to disrupt the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, divert the direction of struggle, prevent the deepening of the great criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, and hinder the implementation of the policy of grasping revolution and promoting production. Factionalism is a major obstacle to fully implementing Chairman Mao's new directives. Therefore, in the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionary fighters must closely learn and follow Chairman Mao's new directives. We must use proletarian party spirit to smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism; use proletarian party spirit to guide all our actions, expose factionalism on the tip of the bayonet, and display it to the masses, fiercely fight it, and thoroughly defeat it! Only in this way can we truly follow our great helmsman Chairman Mao and truly become "revolutionary factions determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

Although I have not yet fully recovered my health, I am determined to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the series of new directives issued by Chairman Mao since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, learning and applying immediately with visible results. I will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The sea may dry up, and the stones may crumble, but my limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao will never change.

    学了就用　立竿见影
    ——活学活用毛主席著作的一点体会
    总后勤部学习毛主席著作积极分子、工建某团十连战士　年四旺
    许多战友要我谈谈学习毛主席著作的体会。其实，我读毛主席的书刚刚开始，体会很少。要说有体会的话，最深刻的一点就是：学了就用，立竿见影。
  带着阶级感情学，带着阶级感情用
    在旧社会，我家祖孙三代给地主扛活，逃荒要饭。一九四八年，毛主席领导的人民解放军解放了我的家乡。我们村的穷人斗倒了地主，翻了身。从我家和我们村翻身解放的经历中，我打心眼里感谢共产党，热爱伟大的领袖毛主席。入伍前，我就暗暗下了决心：“四旺四旺不要忘，不忘过去阶级苦，不忘今日解放甜。”
    我入伍后，学习毛主席著作遍数最多的是“老三篇”；《为人民服务》中的“完全”“彻底”，《纪念白求恩》中的两个“极端”，我都记得很熟。可是，在开始的一段时间，我并没有真正学懂，更谈不上用。因为我当时对自己被分配当工程兵，天天同石头、砖头、泥巴打交道，认为干这行又苦又累没味道，不如当个技术兵，又痛快，又有“出息”。这就是说，那时我还没有用毛泽东思想来改造自己的灵魂。
    后来，一次又一次读毛主席的书，一次又一次的阶级教育，使我想得越来越多。原来在万恶的旧社会，饿死累死的不只是我一家，也不只是我们一个村的穷人，而是千千万万的阶级兄弟。天下乌鸦一般黑。剥削我们穷人的，不只是坑害我家的那几户地主，而是整个地主、资产阶级。是谁把千千万万的劳动人民从苦水坑中救出来的呢？是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。劳动人民是依靠什么力量把压得自己喘不过气来的三座大山推翻的呢？是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想，集中地印在毛主席写的书上，体现在毛主席发出的每一个最新指示上。这时，也只有这时，我才真正觉悟到：毛泽东思想是天下劳动人民的命根子，毛主席的书是全世界革命人民彻底翻身解放的法宝。现在世界上大多数的劳动人民，仍然在受苦受难。他们没有摆脱象我家过去那样的苦日子。我们解放了的人民，有义务有责任去支援他们。我们靠什么去支援呢？最强大的武器是毛主席著作；最可靠的保证，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。在这以后，我读毛主席的书，才算真正入门啦！我觉得饭可以一天两天不吃，毛主席的书不能一天不读。作为一名光荣的解放军战士，读不读毛主席的书，不仅仅是个人进步快和慢的问题，而是能不能好好干革命，能不能为世界革命尽一分力量的问题。
    这样，我对毛主席著作的阶级感情越来越深厚了。我真正体会到：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如毛主席的恩情深，天大地大不如毛泽东思想的威力大。
    这以后，我再学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，就比较地能够学得懂，用得上。我再不是看不起工程兵这个工作，而是把自己的工作看成十分光荣的重要岗位。我自觉地把工地当作战场。我们现在虽然没有面对面地同美国强盗拚刺刀，但是，我能够多搬一块石头，多加一块砖，不是也等于在战场上多消灭了敌人吗？我们把上级交给的工程任务完成得又多又快又好又省，不也是支援了越南人民的抗美斗争，打击了现代修正主义和各国反动派的反革命气焰，直接地支援了世界革命吗？这样一想，学过的毛主席教导，也就用上了，浑身就有使不完的劲！
    也正是因为这样，在我被火车撞伤住院、记忆力受到破坏的时候，我仍然能够认出我们心中的红太阳毛主席，能够背出毛主席的教导：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……”
    我的体会是：毛主席的书，是无产阶级的书，革命的书。我们活学活用毛主席著作，首先要带着阶级感情学，带着阶级感情用。只有带着阶级感情学，才能学得懂，只有带着阶级感情用，才能用得上。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派，以及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，疯狂反对我们活学活用毛主席著作。他们诬蔑我们活学活用毛主席著作是“形式主义”，是“苛捐杂税”。这些胡说八道，也正好从反面证明了活学活用毛主席著作就是要有深厚的无产阶级感情。“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”毛主席写的每篇文章和无产阶级文化大革命以来作的每一个最新指示，都是教育和指导革命群众搞革命的。中国赫鲁晓夫之流，站在资产阶级反动立场上，干着反革命的勾当，他们怎么能够理解我们无产阶级革命战士对毛主席的书无比热爱的阶级感情呢？他们又怎么能不对我们活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，恨得要死，怕得要命呢？
      “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。中国赫鲁晓夫之流和帝、修、反，越是反对我们活学活用毛主席著作，我们越是要带着深厚的阶级感情学，越是要带着强烈的阶级感情用。我们就是要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想扫除一切害人虫，建设一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想新世界！
      在斗争中学，在斗争中用
    带着阶级感情学，是学好用好毛主席著作的根本。但是，并不等于有了无产阶级感情，学和用就没有矛盾，就可以完全结合好了。我的体会是：学和用常常有一定距离。学了不一定会用。要使学用结合起来，就要运用毛泽东思想去战斗，去革命，就要用毛泽东思想之“矢”，去射自己思想和客观实际之“的”。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，除了外部的敌人以外，最危险的敌人、最大的隐患，是混进党内的一小撮资产阶级代理人。他们是我们斗争的主要对象。我们活学活用毛主席著作，武装自己的头脑，从根本上说，就是为了斗倒这一小撮坏家伙和国内的一切牛鬼蛇神，斗倒国际上的帝、修、反。为了斗倒国内外的阶级敌人，就要斗倒自己头脑中的敌人。去年十月一日，我在天安门上亲自听到林副主席传达了伟大领袖毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大号召，当时就万分激动。毛主席这一最新指示，规定了无产阶级文化大革命的根本纲领，反映了我国人民和人民解放军战士的根本要求。林副主席指示我们：斗私，批修，“这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”我的体会是，读毛主席的书，不狠斗“私”字，毛主席的书就学不好，也用不好。只有不断地斗自己头脑里的“私”字，才可能把学和用逐步地结合起来，才能更有力地打击敌人，保证我们的红色江山永不变色。
    有一次，在执行营建任务中，我遇到了危险，脑子里闪过一个怕摔死的念头，是前进呢？还是退缩呢？就在这个时候，我想起了毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，想起了张思德、白求恩的光辉榜样，发觉自己的“私”字冒了头。自己虽然学习了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，但是并没有化为自己的灵魂，并没有真正去用。斗争的结果，
  “公”字把“私”字顶了回去。毛主席的教导鼓舞着我胜利地完成了这次任务。另一次，我参加扛枕木，到工地一看，那么一大堆，头脑里马上又闪过一个念头：“这么些枕木，什么时候才能扛完呀！”这样一想，劲头当然也就起不来了。就在这时，我又记起毛主席在《愚公移山》中讲过的老愚公的故事。愚公精神的可贵，就在于他有不怕困难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命精神。我学习了《愚公移山》，还怕苦怕累，被这么一堆枕木难住了，这还能算听毛主席的话吗？我认识到这又是“私”字抬头，是学和用分了家。马上对自己头脑中的怕苦怕累思想开了火。这样，精神又很快振奋起来。我高声喊着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”扛起一根根枕木，飞快地奔跑起来。
    毛主席教导我们说：“反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”我虽然出身贫苦，又生长在红旗下，但是旧社会的思想残余，对我是有影响的。我自己的体会就证明：学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，不批判个人主义思想，就不能树立完全彻底为人民服务的思想；学习了《愚公移山》，不向怕苦怕累、贪图安逸的思想作斗争，在遇到敌人和困难时，就不能“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同样，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们革命派如果学习了毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，但不去斗自己头脑里的“私”字，不向自己的派性、小团体主义作斗争，就不能继续深入开展革命的大批判，促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入展开斗批改。一句话，就不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    能不能狠斗“私”字，是对伟大领袖毛主席，对毛泽东思想热爱不热爱的问题；是对毛主席的革命路线紧跟不紧跟的问题；是对毛主席著作的根本态度问题。毛主席著作字字句句都是为“公”的。有了“私”字，就不可能无限热爱毛主席，就不可能做到毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，就不可能永远忠于毛主席。林副主席指示说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我在思想革命化的道路上取得的每一点进步，都是用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争的结果。要学好用好毛主席著作，解决学和用的矛盾，忠于毛主席是根本，斗私是关键。
    学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用
    读了毛主席的书，就要去用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。可是，毛主席的书内容非常丰富，思想非常深刻。我们一个普通战士受觉悟水平、实践经验、工作岗位等等条件的限制，一般说来，只能学到一部分。我自己尽上最大努力，只能学习到一点点。而且常常是读了毛主席的一句话，听到毛主席发出的一个最新指示，还不能马上理解，不能完全自觉地紧跟紧用。这也是一个实际的矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，我的体会是：要学一点，就用一点，反复学，反复用。
    饭要一口一口地吃，学习毛主席著作也要一点一点地学，一点一点地用。拿“老三篇”来说，我开始学的是《为人民服务》。这一篇中有几个重要观点，我最先学最先用的是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”这个观点。尝到了用的甜头以后，才又学了为人民服务，有了缺点就不怕批评以及其他的观点。毛主席的这些教导，给了我无穷无尽的力量，使我能够做到为了革命利益临危不惧，使我不断地狠斗自己的“私”字一闪念。今天学一点、用一点，明天学一点、用一点，天长日久，就很自然地会把许多点连成片，学到用到的也就多了。
    毛主席的话，是伟大的真理。只有反复学、反复用，才能真正学得懂，用得上，才能让毛泽东思想在自己的头脑里扎根。我体会到：不怕不会用，就怕不去用。只要反复学，反复用，越用理解越深，越用效果越大，就能不断促进思想革命化。毛泽东思想是改造人的灵魂最强大最有效的武器。可是，我们自己头脑中的“私”字，不是斗一次、二次就可以彻底解决的，而是要有针对性地反复学习、反复运用，才能让“公”字把“私”字最后吃掉。当我作了一点有益于人民的事情以后，党和人民给了我很高的荣誉，走到那里，同志们都称赞我。听到的掌声多了，我就产生了保荣誉的思想苗头。我有时就过分谨慎小心，不敢多讲话，怕讲错了，影响不好；有了缺点，有时也不敢象过去那样痛痛快快地端出来，怕别人知道，面子上不好看，有时头脑中还闪出自己学得不错的想法。针对自己思想上这些不好的苗头，我反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”，“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”近半年来，组织上要我到过二、三十个地方去学习兄弟单位的经验和介绍自己的学习心得。我每到一个地方，都反复学习几遍毛主席的上述教导。这样，我的保荣誉的思想苗头和内心隐藏的骄傲情绪，就一次又一次地被克服，在促进思想革命化方面，也就一天比一天有进步。
    毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命以来发出了一系列极其重要的最新指示。对于毛主席的最新指示，每一个无产阶级革命战士，就是要学一点就用一点。狠学狠用，真学真用，反复学，反复用，做到条条落实，句句照办。在这方面，我因为颅脑严重损伤，客观条件有一些限制，和其他同志比较，是有很大差距的。但是，我自己也下定这样的决心：我的身体受伤了，可是思想并没有受伤；身体不得已休养了，思想可绝对不能休养。颅脑伤势重，挡不住我忠于伟大领袖毛主席革命路线的一片心；身体不能随意走动，也阻隔不了我紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论中指出：“革命越向前发展，就越是深刻地触及到人们的灵魂，无产阶级的‘公’字和资产阶级的
  ‘私’字的冲突就越突出。”革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就是‘私’字的集中表现。它时而从右的方面，时而从极“左”的方面，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，甚至被阶级敌人利用，来破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合，转移斗争大方向，使革命大批判和斗批改深入不下去，妨碍抓革命，促生产方针的贯彻执行。派性，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的极大障碍。因此，在当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，我们无产阶级革命战士，对毛主席的最新指示，一定要紧学紧跟。我们一定要用无产阶级党性大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性；用无产阶级党性指导自己的一切行动，把派性挑在“刺刀”尖上，亮在群众面前，狠狠地斗，彻底打倒！这样，才能真正紧跟我们伟大的舵手毛主席，真正成为“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
    我现在虽然还没有完全恢复健康，但是我决心狠学狠用毛主席著作和无产阶级文化大革命以来毛主席的一系列最新指示，学了就用，立竿见影。坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。海可枯，石可烂，我无限忠于毛主席的决心永不变。（附图片）
    毛主席的话，是伟大的真理。只有反复学，反复用，才能真正学得懂，用得上，才能让毛泽东思想在自己头脑里深深扎根。
