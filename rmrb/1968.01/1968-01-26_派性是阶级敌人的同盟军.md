Under the influence of the "January Revolution" storm, the four revolutionary mass organizations in our factory united in January last year to seize power from a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and established a temporary power organ—the Joint Committee. However, with the change in status, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reactionary thoughts such as sectarianism, wind-baggery, and cliquism spread in the minds of some leaders of the mass organizations. They expelled revolutionary mass organizations with differing views from the temporary power organ and attacked their comrades-in-arms as enemies. Therefore, the "internal war" among the various revolutionary mass organizations in our factory has been unending, seriously affecting the revolution and production.

Class enemies deeply understand that factionalism is their best ally. Seeing the revolutionary ranks fighting "internal wars," they are overjoyed and spread malicious rumors and set fires, sticking their black hands into the revolutionary ranks, stirring up one faction against another, attempting to fish in troubled waters. The capitalist roaders even shouted, "Fighting 'internal wars' is also a good situation; if you don't fight, you can't tell who is revolutionary." Another capitalist roader, fearing that the proletarian heaven would not be chaotic, openly took off his shirt and personally drafted a big-character poster to incite the "internal war."

However, some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations were temporarily blinded by factionalism, thinking only of "me as the core." Facing the sabotage activities of class enemies, they did not notice it but instead mistook enemies for friends, describing capitalist roaders as "revolutionary cadres" and rightists as "revolutionary leftists," while attacking comrades who disagreed with their views as enemies, launching a fierce attack. This disrupted Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the direction of the revolutionary struggle, once creating a situation where friends were hurt and enemies were pleased.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued a new directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's directive made us see clearly, woke us up, and helped us distinguish right from wrong. We resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's directive. With the help of the stationed PLA, we exposed the harm of factionalism. At the same time, we followed the clues to expose the black hands hiding in the dark corners—the capitalist roaders—and fought them down and exposed them. Our factory truly achieved revolutionary great unity on a new basis. From our personal experience, we deeply realized that factionalism is the best ally of class enemies. The proletarian revolutionary faction must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly defeat factionalism.

    派性是阶级敌人的同盟军
    贵州遵义电厂“八·二五”战斗团
    在“一月革命”风暴的影响下，我厂四个革命群众组织，在去年一月就联合起来夺了厂党内一小撮走资派的权，成立了临时权力机构——联合委员会。但是，随着地位的变化，山头主义、风头主义、小团体主义等资产阶级和小资产阶级的反动思想，在某些群众组织负责人的头脑中泛滥起来。他们把和自己观点不同的革命群众组织开除出临时权力机构，把自己的战友当作敌人来攻击。因此，我厂各革命群众组织之间“内战”不休，严重影响了革命和生产。
    阶级敌人深深懂得：派性是他们最好的同盟军。他们看到革命队伍里打“内战”，满心欢喜，便到处煽阴风，点鬼火，把黑手伸进革命队伍里，拉一派，打一派，企图混水摸鱼。走资派甚至叫嚷：“打‘内战’也是好形势，不打分不清谁是革命派。”另一个走资派更是唯恐无产阶级的天下不乱，公然赤膊上阵，亲自起草煽动打“内战”的大字报。
    可是，某些革命群众组织的头头一时被派性迷了心窍，一心想着“以我为核心”，面对阶级敌人的破坏活动，竟觉察不出来，反而认敌为友，把走资派说成是“革命的领导干部”，把右派分子描绘成“革命左派”；而把不同意自己观点的同志当成敌人，大肆攻击。这样，就干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署，干扰了革命斗争的大方向，一度造成了亲者痛、仇者快的局面。
    正在这个关键时刻，毛主席发出了最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的指示，使我们擦亮了眼睛，清醒了头脑，分清了是非。我们坚决按毛主席的指示办事，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，控诉了派性的危害性。同时顺藤摸瓜，把躲在阴暗角落里的黑手——走资派揪了出来，斗倒斗臭。我厂在新的基础上真正实现了革命的大联合。我们从亲身的经历中深刻地认识到：派性是阶级敌人最好的同盟军。无产阶级革命派一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底打倒派性。
