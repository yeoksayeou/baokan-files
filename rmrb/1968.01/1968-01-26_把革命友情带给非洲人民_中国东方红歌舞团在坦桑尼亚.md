In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe visited the friendly East African nation of Tanzania for 35 days of performances. Their performances of revolutionary Chinese songs and dances left a deep impression on the African people who are engaged in anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles.

The Cultural Revolution Renews the Stage

Every time the stage presented performances of songs and dances that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, such as "Fighting South Vietnam" and "Ode to the Storm," the audience responded with strong resonance. A freedom fighter from Africa, after watching the performance, said, "Chairman Mao's teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' is the truth. We must learn from the Chinese people to take the path of armed struggle and self-reliance to achieve national liberation." A Tanzanian student said, "The power of Chairman Mao's people's war thought is boundless. Any aggressor will be annihilated in the vast sea of the people's war."

Two years ago, a leader of an African national liberation movement who had visited China said, "The Cultural Revolution in China not only opens a new era for the world revolution but also renews the stage of arts, making the Chinese revolutionary art stage appear completely new."

New Inspiration—Art Serves the Revolution

In the capital of Tanzania, Chinese artists were invited to introduce Chairman Mao's artistic line and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the students and faculty of the Department of Arts at the University of Dar es Salaam. After the introduction, a teacher from the Department of Arts said, "We have been exploring how song and dance art can serve the revolution. From your performances and introductions, we have gained new inspiration." A Tanzanian educator told the troupe leader, "Your performances in Tanzania will help us eliminate the cultural poison left by imperialism and colonialism and help us restore and develop Tanzanian national culture."

The national newspaper of the Tanganyika African National Union, *The Nationalist*, in an article commenting on the performance of the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe, highly praised Chairman Mao's policy of serving proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers with art. The commentary said that the performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe was completely different from the "entertainment" of other visiting art troupes in that the Chinese artists' performance was "very educational" and in line with the revolutionary aspirations of the workers and peasants in Tanzania and Africa. The performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe "fully embodied the idea of art serving the revolution and was a criticism of the bourgeois view of art for art's sake."

Artists Under the Guidance of Chairman Mao

Chinese artists firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Despite the hardships of travel and the conditions of the performance venues, as long as they could perform for more African people, especially more African laborers, they felt the greatest joy. In Tanzania, they arranged special performances for workers, farmers, fishermen, and national defense soldiers, which were warmly welcomed. Many Tanzanian laborers, dressed in their finest, traveled from far away to watch the Chinese performers.

During the performance in Zanzibar for fishermen and soldiers, the performers gave the cool shade of the trees to the audience and performed under the scorching sun. No matter where they performed, all the members of the troupe would work together to set up the stage and load and unload the props. These actions deeply moved the African audience. The Tanzanian people praised them as "artists under the guidance of Chairman Mao" and said they "faithfully carried out Chairman Mao's artistic line."

    把革命友情带给非洲人民
    中国东方红歌舞团在坦桑尼亚
    在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命凯歌声中，中国东方红歌舞团到东非友好国家坦桑尼亚进行了三十五天的访问演出。他们演出的中国革命歌舞给处在反帝反殖斗争中的非洲人民留下了深刻的印象。
      文化大革命革新了文艺舞台
    每当舞台上表演闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的、歌颂亚非拉人民革命斗争的歌舞《战斗的越南南方》、《风雷颂》等节目时，观众中就引起了强烈的共鸣。一位非洲自由战士看了之后说：“毛主席‘枪杆子里面出政权’的教导就是真理，我们要学习中国人民走武装斗争、自力更生的道路，才能取得民族解放。”一位坦桑尼亚大学生说，毛主席的人民战争思想威力无穷，任何侵略者一定被消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中。
    两年前曾访问过中国的一位非洲民族解放运动领导人说：“中国的文化大革命不仅为世界革命开辟了新纪元，而且刷新了文艺的舞台，使中国革命艺术舞台出现了完全崭新的面貌。”
    新的启示——文艺为革命服务
    在坦桑尼亚首都，中国文艺工作者应邀向达累斯萨拉姆大学学院艺术系师生介绍毛主席的文艺路线和中国无产阶级文化大革命。一位艺术系教师听了介绍后说：“我们过去一直在探索歌舞艺术如何为革命服务的问题，从你们的演出和介绍中我们得到了新的启示。”一位坦桑尼亚的教育工作者向歌舞团团长说：“你们在坦桑尼亚的演出将有助于我们铲除帝国主义、殖民主义的文化遗毒，有助于我们恢复和发展坦桑尼亚的民族文化。”
    坦噶尼喀民族联盟机关报《民族主义者报》在评论中国东方红歌舞团演出的文章中，高度赞扬毛主席文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的方针。评论说，中国歌舞团的演出同其他来访的文艺团体的“娱乐”完全不同之点，在于中国艺术家的演出“很富有教育意义”，并且符合我国和非洲工人农民的革命愿望。中国歌舞团的演出，“完整地体现了文艺为革命服务的思想，是对资产阶级为艺术而艺术的观点的批判。”
    毛主席教导下的文艺战士
    中国文艺工作者牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”他们不顾旅途劳累，不论演出场地条件，只要能为更多的非洲人民，特别是更多的非洲劳动人民演出，他们就感到是最大的愉快。在坦桑尼亚，他们为工人、农民、渔民、国防军战士安排了专场演出，受到热烈欢迎。许多坦桑尼亚劳动人民穿着节日盛装，从很远的地方赶来观看中国演员的表演。
    在桑给巴尔为渔民和战士演出时，演员们把凉爽的树荫让给观众，自己在烈日下表演。不论在什么地方演出，全团同志总是一起动手搭台、装卸道具。这些行动使非洲观众十分感动。坦桑尼亚人民赞扬他们是“毛主席教导下的文艺战士”，他们“忠实地执行了毛主席的文艺路线”。
