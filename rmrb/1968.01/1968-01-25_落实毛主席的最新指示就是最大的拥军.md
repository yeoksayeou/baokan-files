Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest form of supporting the military.

In Huanghuacheng Brigade of Huanghuacheng Commune, Huairou County, there are ten revolutionary mass organizations. Because they have been entangled by the poisonous snake of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they often have friction and engage in "internal warfare" among themselves, and cannot properly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Some organizations cling to their own "mountain strongholds" and not only do not listen to the help from the military supporting the left, but also mistakenly believe that supporting them is supporting the left, and not supporting them is supporting the faction. The revolutionary great alliance encounters great obstacles.

Old poor peasant Zhao Wenshi saw this situation and was very anxious. He thought: The military regards the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as their first priority, working tirelessly for us poor and lower-middle peasants, helping us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Now, Chairman Mao calls on us to achieve revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. I am a Communist Party member and should actively assist the military in doing political and ideological work, so that the various revolutionary mass organizations can quickly achieve revolutionary great alliance.

With the support and assistance of the military, Zhao Wenshi often visits the homes of the leaders of various mass organizations to do patient and meticulous political and ideological work, helping them raise their awareness and fight against the "self" in their minds. A leader of a mass organization, because he saw more of his own strengths and less of others', often had disputes with other organizations. Zhao Wenshi studied with him Mao Zedong's teaching of "each making self-criticism," guiding him to use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to look at problems, and together with him, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and together recalled bitterness and sweetness, finally making him quickly realize his mistakes. Under Zhao Wenshi's influence, many people did political and ideological work for each other, talked to military comrades, and severely criticized their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. At the Mao Zedong Thought study class and the struggle-session-criticize-revisionism-lecture meeting, they deeply felt: "The reason we cannot unite is that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in our minds is playing tricks, and the 'self' has bewitched our hearts. Ten thousand regrets, all because of the 'self' character. Ten thousand should nots, should not go against Chairman Mao's teachings!" They unanimously declared: We will do as Chairman Mao instructs! We will firmly unite with the military, fight with the military, and achieve victory with the military, and support the military with actual actions!

Soon, this brigade achieved the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    落实毛主席的最新指示就是最大的拥军
    怀柔县黄花城公社黄花城大队有十个革命群众组织，由于被资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这条毒蛇缠住了身，彼此之间经常闹磨擦，打“内战”，对毛主席的最新指示不能很好地落实。有的组织死抱住“山头”不放，对支左解放军同志的帮助不但听不进去，反而错误地认为支持我才是支左，不支持我就是支派。革命的大联合遇到了很大阻力。
    老贫农赵文仕看到这种情况，心里十分着急。他想：解放军把宣传毛泽东思想当作第一生命，整天辛辛苦苦为我们贫下中农操劳，帮助我们活学活用毛主席著作。眼下，毛主席号召我们要实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合。我是个共产党员，应该积极协助解放军做好政治思想工作，使各革命群众组织尽快地实现革命大联合。
    在解放军的支持协助下，赵文仕经常到各群众组织头头的家里做耐心细致的政治思想工作，帮助他们提高认识，向头脑中的“私”字作斗争。一个群众组织的头头由于看自己长处多，看别人长处少，经常和其它组织闹纠纷。赵文仕就和他一起学习毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导，引导他用一分为二的观点看问题，和他一起斗私批修，一起忆苦思甜，终于使他很快觉悟过来。在赵文仕的带动下，很多群众都互相做政治思想工作，找解放军同志谈心，狠批自己的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。在毛泽东思想学习班斗私批修讲用会上，他们深有体会地说：“我们之所以联合不起来，就是头脑里的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在作怪，是‘我’字迷住了心窍。千恨万恨，就恨在一个‘私’字上。千不该万不该，不该违背毛主席的教导！”他们一致表示：毛主席怎么指示，我们就怎么办！坚决和解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，以实际行动拥军！
    不久，这个大队便实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
