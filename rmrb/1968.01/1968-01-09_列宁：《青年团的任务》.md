	We need a generation of young people who, through disciplined and ruthless struggle against the bourgeoisie, have begun to become conscious individuals. It is through this struggle that they can educate themselves into genuine communists. They must ensure that every step they take in learning, education, and training is subordinated to this struggle and linked with it.

    必需有这样一代青年，他们在同资产阶级作有纪律的残酷斗争中已开始成为自觉的人。他们在这个斗争中才能把自己教育成真正的共产主义者，他们应当使自己学习、教育和训练的每一步骤都服从这个斗争，都同这个斗争联系起来。
