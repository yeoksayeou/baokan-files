Fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is our fundamental guarantee for victory. Deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying Mao Zedong Thought. Resolutely seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. The military and people of the entire nation are vigorously promoting and studying the New Year's editorial, determined to complete the five combat tasks for this year.

	BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- "The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people across the country are seriously studying the New Year's editorial "Greeting the Comprehensive Victory of the Cultural Revolution" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. They have a deeper understanding that great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for all our victories. They say that the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. In the new year, we must carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, establish the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, and resolutely become models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We will seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	In recent days, the revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory committees of provinces and municipalities such as Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Guizhou, Tianjin, Guangdong, Sichuan, Gansu, Qingdao, and Hangzhou have held meetings to study and discuss the New Year's editorial word by word. Some have also held discussions, telephone conferences, and grand oath-taking rallies with local revolutionary mass organizations, vigorously promoting and implementing the New Year's editorial. At these meetings, speakers unanimously emphasized that the most fundamental task mentioned in the New Year's editorial is to focus on and grasp the education of Mao Zedong Thought, turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses.

	The revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City jointly held a mobilization meeting today, deploying the combat tasks for the entire province in 1968 according to the spirit of the New Year's editorial. Pan Fusheng, the chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee, pointed out at the meeting that deeply carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, making the various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes a central task, and letting Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and various latest instructions be directly grasped by the broad masses of people is the fundamental guarantee for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. At the oath-taking rally held today in the Xining area of Qinghai Province for 40,000 military and civilian personnel to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Jianglin, deputy chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, called on all levels of revolutionary committees (revolutionary preparatory committees) and revolutionary mass organizations to take immediate action to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the oath-taking rally held today in Lanzhou for 100,000 military and civilian personnel in the Lanzhou area, Xiao Henghan, a responsible person from the Lanzhou Military Region and the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee, emphasized that studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental, the soul, and the core of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. Where Chairman Mao's instructions are implemented, there is victory; comprehensive implementation means comprehensive victory. At the provincial telephone conference held today, a responsible person from the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee called on the military and civilian personnel of the entire province and various revolutionary mass organizations to combine the study of the New Year's editorial with the study of the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, and truly become like Comrade Li Wenzhong, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	During the study of the New Year's editorial, revolutionary masses across the country pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought study classes are a good form of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the new year, we must establish the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, further vigorously carry out study classes, and run good study classes. Shanghai Third Steel Plant held 86 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in 1967, with 12,000 people participating in the study. Revolutionary workers, after studying the New Year's editorial, decided to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes better in 1968, taking "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle to carry out the ideological revolutionization of revolutionary workers. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in the communes, brigades, and production teams in the suburbs of Nanchang City, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres deeply felt that running good Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the best form of large-scale propaganda, large-scale study, large-scale popularization, and large-scale implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They expressed their determination to further vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes and quickly implement Chairman Mao's combat tasks for 1968, making it the action guideline for every revolutionary cadre and every revolutionary member in the new year. Some responsible persons of the temporary committee of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress in Wuhan proposed that in the new year, Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be seriously and solidly run on a large scale, making the study classes cover all factories, workshops, and workers' families in the entire city. The revolutionary masses of Changsha City's Qingshuitang Street, where Mao Zedong Thought study classes are well-run, seriously studied the New Year's editorial and unanimously proposed to be humble and modest, to continue to make efforts, and to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes better in a fighting posture, to complete the five combat tasks for 1968 perfectly, and to achieve new merits in seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country emphasized that to truly master great Mao Zedong Thought and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must cherish deep class feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and work hard on the use of words. Revolutionary teachers and students of the Inner Mongolia Normal University, together with Teng Haicheng, chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, who had gone deep into the university, studied the New Year's editorial. They decided that in the new year, the study of Chairman Mao's works must achieve a loyal heart, highlight the use, grasp the speed, and advocate the public, ensuring deeper study and better use. Revolutionary teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics held a meeting to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works in the morning of the 2nd to welcome the new year. Many revolutionary teachers and students said that we must work hard on the loyalty and use, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our study and struggle, and use Mao Zedong Thought to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers of the Anhui Textile General Factory's Component Factory listened to the broadcast of the editorial on New Year's Eve and that night tore down all the slogans and banners with factional characteristics posted in the factory and replaced them with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said that in the new year, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against selfishness, eradicate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. More than 1,000 representatives attending the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region in Taiyuan expressed that we revolutionary cadres must not leave the great helmsman Chairman Mao, not leave the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, not leave Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented item by item and comprehensively, truly doing our best to believe in Chairman Mao without the slightest wavering, follow Chairman Mao without the slightest hesitation, and defend Chairman Mao without the slightest change!

	Under the inspiration of the important editorial "Greeting the Comprehensive Victory of the Cultural Revolution," revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country are determined to use Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to guide all their thoughts and actions, to raise the struggle against selfishness to the height of the struggle between the two lines, to actively attack the bourgeois selfishness with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and to strive to climb the peak of publicness, determined to be revolutionary cadres who will carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Members of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group said in a discussion on the New Year's editorial that the Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. The more the revolution develops, the more deeply it touches people's souls, and the more prominent the contradiction between public and private becomes. We must further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use the "Three Articles" as weapons, fiercely fight against the bourgeois selfishness, and establish the publicness of the proletariat, eradicating all non-proletarian thoughts. Red Guards of colleges and universities in Ningxia, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, expressed that in the brilliant 1968, we must build our ranks into a revolutionary team with high revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, making our team a model in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a model in criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism. Revolutionary workers of the Tire Factory in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, reviewed the battle course of more than a year and said excitedly that in more than a year, every step forward we took was a victory of publicness and a defeat of selfishness, and it was the result of changing the worldview according to Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely overthrow selfishness to truly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment at all times and in all matters, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force warmly welcomed the publication of the New Year's editorial in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily in 1968, and quickly launched a wave of large-scale study and propaganda. The broad cadres and soldiers are determined that in the new year, they will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and more practically run Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They will ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented item by item and comprehensively, resolutely seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	In recent days, cadres and soldiers of various general departments, various military branches, and the Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Fuzhou military regions, and the Tibet and Xinjiang military regions have extensively and deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorial. Many units held party committee meetings on New Year's Eve, with cadres taking the lead in studying, and from the first day of the new year, they organized discussion meetings and experience-sharing meetings extensively. Many veteran Red Army soldiers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorial, went deep into the companies and with the soldiers, concentrated time and energy to repeatedly study and discuss. Cadres and soldiers fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" studied with local revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, closely combining the local struggle reality and personal experiences, adopting the method of talking about the situation, significance, and tasks, making the study activities lively and in-depth. Many units also organized propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools to carry out propaganda, making the spirit of the New Year's editorial known to every household and every person. Soldiers stationed on the Pamir Plateau sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the living areas of Tajik, Kirgiz, and Uyghur ethnic minorities to carry out propaganda. Soldiers stationed on Nanri Island in Fujian Province quickly rehearsed cultural performances and wrote the New Year's editorial into big red happy news, riding colorful boats, breaking through the waves, and beating drums and gongs, going to the 18 islands, knocking on every door to propagate to the fishery masses. The fishermen, after listening to the propaganda, were all excited and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

	"The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Cadres and soldiers of the Tianjin Garrison Support-Left Liaison Station of the People's Liberation Army, combining the actual situation of support-left work, deeply felt that great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for all victories. They said that among thousands of important things, the most important thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Cadres and soldiers of the Pinggu County People's Armed Forces Department of the Beijing Garrison, known as the support-left red flag, summed up the experience of support-left work in the past year in light of the New Year's editorial. They said that among thousands of experiences, the most important experience is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Cadres and soldiers expressed that in the new year, they would hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, with better study and application of Chairman Mao's works, to resolutely implement the spirit of the New Year's editorial, and raise the "three supports and two militaries" work to a new level.

	Various units have seriously studied how to raise the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They are determined that in the new year, they will further focus on and grasp the education of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen ideological and political work, practically run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously carry forward the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, and ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented item by item and comprehensively. Representatives of the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the Guangzhou Military Region unanimously believed that carrying forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao must study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use them after studying them, deeply understand them, resolutely act according to them, regularly check them, and summarize them in time. Cadres and soldiers executing military training tasks at Caochangdi Middle School in Beijing helped revolutionary teachers and students turn Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, making this middle school achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in March last year. Cadres and soldiers expressed that in the new year, in the struggle to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, and to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, they will make new contributions!
