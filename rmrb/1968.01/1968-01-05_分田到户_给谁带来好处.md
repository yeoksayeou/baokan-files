Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years it has been individual economy, with each family a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic base of feudal rule, and it keeps the peasants in perpetual poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only road to collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, five hundred million peasants in our country resolutely follow the socialist path. My hometown, Jinzhai County in Anhui Province, was originally a poor and backward mountainous area. After liberation, like other places in the country, it organized mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and people's communes. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have displayed the "Yugong moves mountains" spirit, transforming the mountainous landscape: collective production has greatly developed, and the consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants has greatly improved.

The poor and lower-middle peasants all say: "A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, the people's commune is the best. Agricultural collectivization is the path to light, the communist paradise is beautiful, the people's commune is a golden bridge."

However, China's Khrushchev hates the victory of socialism in the countryside so much that he gnashes his teeth. He maliciously attacks the people's commune, saying: "The peasants have not benefited from the collective economy in recent years." He also blathers on about: "The people's commune was established too early and has been a failure." A small clique of capitalist roaders within the Anhui Provincial Party, following the orders of their master, spread the evil wind of "three autonomies and one contract," promoting the black goods of "dividing land to households." China's Khrushchev and his accomplices seized this "model" to play their counter-revolutionary tricks, sending their black henchmen to summarize black experiences and engage in counter-revolutionary propaganda, attempting to raise a black flag nationwide and turn Anhui into a stronghold for restoring capitalism in China.

I have personally seen the disastrous consequences of "dividing land to households." It seriously undermines the collective economy and causes severe polarization in the countryside. In our village, a poor widow with four children has only one labor force. After "dividing land to households," she lacks labor, tools, and fertilizer. Sowing and harvesting require help from others. During the busy season, she begs relatives and friends, but cannot find anyone, misses the agricultural season, and fails to harvest grain. Clothing and food are not secured, and she sadly says: "Dividing land to households has ruined my family."

Isn't China's Khrushchev clearly trying to drag us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the evil old society and push us back into the sea of suffering? Yet China's Khrushchev says: "In many places, peasants, and even cadres, demand individual farming and dividing land to households." This is pure nonsense.

In our mountainous area, there are indeed people who want to "divide land to households." When the black wind of "dividing land to households" blew into our village, an untransformed landlord joyfully said: "Finally, the day has come, the land has returned to the family. Whoever takes my land must return it in full." Under his threat, the four mu of paddy fields and more than two mu of tea mountains that poor peasant Wang Hongben received during the land reform were taken back. This landlord then sold the land to a wealthy middle peasant. A rich peasant family had five full labor forces. After "dividing land to households," he used three labor forces for farming and two for "sideline work," taking mountain products to other places for speculation. In less than a year, he bought a draft cow and built five brick houses. In the spring of 1961, he even hired a temporary worker.

This is the so-called "benefit" brought by the "dividing land to households" advocated by the biggest capitalist roader within the Party. This clearly aims to let the exploiting classes ride on the people's heads again and put the poor and lower-middle peasants to death. Is this what "many places' peasants, and even cadres" demand? As the saying goes: what kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. China's Khrushchev, as Chairman Mao said, is completely "standing on the side of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or rich middle peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies, scheming for a few people." China's Khrushchev peddles the black goods of "dividing land to households" to let capitalism freely spread in the countryside, undermine the foundations of socialism, and restore capitalism.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Only socialism can save China!" They have resolutely fought against the black wind of "dividing land to households." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dachong Brigade in our commune have united as one, firmly believing that "the people's commune is good." They say: "The path of collectivization is the one Chairman Mao pointed out for us. The people's commune is what Chairman Mao led us to establish. In the past, Chairman Mao saved us from the fire pit, and now Chairman Mao is leading us to happiness. We do not believe in heaven, we do not believe in earth, we believe in Chairman Mao with all our hearts. The collective economy of the people's commune is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We are determined to follow the path of collectivization." Old poor peasant Wang Shiqiu says: "Dividing land to households is a dead end. Landlords and rich peasants clap their hands in joy, and we will suffer twice. If they want us to disband and farm individually, it would be better for the sun to rise from the west mountain top." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dachong Brigade have defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with practical actions, giving China's Khrushchev a hard blow and stopping the wind of individual farming.

Now, the people in our mountainous area are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of spreading the black wind of "dividing land to households" in the countryside, thoroughly purging all the poison he spread in the countryside, and vowing to fight the struggle between the two lines in the countryside to the end! Let the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate every corner of the countryside.

### “分田到户”给谁带来好处

    “分田到户”给谁带来好处
    吴明录
    毛主席教导我们：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”在毛主席光辉思想指引下，我国五亿农民坚定不移地走社会主义道路。我的家乡安徽省金寨县，原来是个贫穷落后的山区。解放后，它和全国各地一样，在组织了互助组、初级社、高级社、人民公社以后，广大贫下中农发扬了“愚公移山”的硬骨头精神，使山区面貌发生巨变：集体生产大发展，贫下中农的觉悟大提高。
    贫下中农都说：“一千个好，一万个好，人民公社就是好。农业集体化，走的是光明道，共产主义天堂美，人民公社是金桥。”
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫对社会主义在农村的胜利，恨得咬牙切齿。他恶毒地攻击人民公社说：“农民这几年从集体经济中间没有得到好处。”还胡说什么：“人民公社办早了，办糟了。”安徽省党内一小撮走资派，秉承其主子的旨意，大刮“三自一包”的妖风，推行“分田到户”的黑货。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，就抓住这个“样板”，大耍反革命伎俩，派其黑爪牙，总结黑经验，大做反革命宣传，企图在全国树起一杆黑旗，把安徽搞成一个在中国进行复辟资本主义的据点。
    我亲眼看到“分田到户”所造成的累累恶果。它严重破坏集体经济，使农村出现了严重的两极分化。俺村一个贫农寡妇有四个孩子，只有她一个劳力，“分田到户”以后，她一缺劳力，二少农具，三无肥料，下种收割都要靠别人帮助。大忙季节，她求亲告友，也找不着人，误了农时，收不到粮食，衣食没有着落，她伤心地说：“田地分到户，可把俺一家人害苦了”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫推行“分田到户”的黑货，不是分明要把我们贫下中农拉回万恶的旧社会，重新打入苦海吗？可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“许多地方的农民甚而至于干部，要求单干，要求分田到户。”这纯粹是胡说八道。
    在我们山区想搞“分田到户”的也确有其人。“分田到户”黑风一刮到俺们村，一个没有改造好的地主就兴高采烈地说：“总算盼到了这一天，土地又还家啦，谁分俺的地，如数交出来。”在他的威胁下，贫农王洪本土改时分到的四亩水田，二亩多茶山，被倒算回去了，这个地主又把地转卖给一户富裕中农。一个富农家里有五个整劳力，“分田到户”以后，他抽三个劳力种田，两个劳力专搞“副业”，带着山货到外地投机倒把，不到一年，他就买了一头耕牛，盖了五间瓦房。一九六一年春季，他又雇了一个短工。
    这就是党内最大的走资派所鼓吹的“分田到户”带来的所谓“好处”。这分明是要剥削阶级重新骑在人民头上，把贫下中农置于死地。难道说这就是“许多地方的农民甚而至于干部”的要求吗？常言道：什么蔓结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。中国的赫鲁晓夫正如毛主席所说的：完全是“站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意”。中国赫鲁晓夫推销“分田到户”的黑货，就是要让资本主义在农村自由泛滥，挖社会主义的墙脚，搞资本主义复辟。
    广大贫下中农牢记毛主席的教导：“只有社会主义能够救中国”！他们同“分田到户”黑风进行了坚决的斗争。我们公社大冲大队广大贫下中农团结一条心，坚信“人民公社好”。他们说：“集体化道路是毛主席给俺指引的，人民公社是毛主席领导俺办起来的。过去毛主席救俺出火坑，现在毛主席又领导俺谋幸福。俺不信天、不信地，一心信仰毛主席。人民公社集体经济是俺贫下中农的命根子，集体化的道路我们是走定了。”老贫农汪世奎说：“把田分到户，走的是绝路，地富拍手叫好，俺们要受二遍苦，要叫俺们散伙单干，除非太阳从西山顶上出。”大冲大队广大贫下中农以实际行动捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，给中国赫鲁晓夫当头一棒，刹住了“单干”风。
    现在，我们山区的人民高举革命大批判的旗帜，正在彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村大刮“分田到户”黑风的滔天罪行，彻底肃清他在农村所散布的一切流毒，誓把农村两条道路、两条路线斗争进行到底！让毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，照亮农村的每一个角落。
