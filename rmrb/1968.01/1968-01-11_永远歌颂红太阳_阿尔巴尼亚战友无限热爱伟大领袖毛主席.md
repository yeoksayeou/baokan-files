When the heroic People's Republic of Albania celebrated its 22nd anniversary, I couldn't help but recall the unforgettable days I spent with the members of the "One Hand Holding a Hoe, the Other a Gun" amateur art troupe from Tirana who came to our country for a visit and performance, especially the touching scenes of Albanian comrades expressing their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao.

On the distant Adriatic coast, Albanian comrades always looked towards red Beijing, day and night, yearning to see the great teacher Chairman Mao. On October 1, 1967, Chairman Mao ascended the Tiananmen Gate to review the revolutionary masses of the capital celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The 98 Albanian comrades on the red reviewing stand immediately burst into excitement: "Chairman Mao has come!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" People jumped and cheered with tears of joy, waving their hands and throwing bouquets of flowers into the sky, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao with the loudest songs. In the art troupe, the 13-year-old Young Pioneer Rumi ran several times to the end of the reviewing stand, looking towards Tiananmen Gate, but she couldn't see where Chairman Mao was, and she stamped her feet in frustration and cried. Later, she pressed a portrait of Chairman Mao tightly to her chest and said to me, "I often dream of Chairman Mao. He is radiant and smiling at us. This time, coming to China, I must see Chairman Mao."

Rumi's wish finally came true. On the afternoon of October 7, the happiest moment arrived. Our most beloved great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, received the entire art troupe and took a photo with them. The Albanian comrades were so excited and moved! After the reception, they ran around with tears of joy, hugging and cheering with Chinese comrades, saying that this was the most unforgettable day of their lives. The next morning, early in the day, the actors Z. Haxho and A. Aliya, who played Wu Qinghua and Lao Si in the ballet "Red Detachment of Women," hurriedly opened the newspaper, cut out the photo of Chairman Mao receiving the art troupe, and sent it back to their families in distant Tirana with a letter to share the good news.

How could the comrades not long for the place where the red sun rises, Shaoshan, and the cradle of revolution, Jinggangshan, with such love and admiration for Chairman Mao?

On October 26, under a clear sky and crisp autumn air, the Albanian comrades sang revolutionary songs and arrived at Shaoshan, bathed in red light. Everyone visited every room in Chairman Mao's former residence and every piece of furniture and agricultural tool he used. Dancer Hasan excitedly left a message on the table Chairman Mao used: "Long live Chairman Mao!" A. Aliya, while stamping Shaoshan's commemorative seal on "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said emotionally, "Shaoshan is the cradle of the revolution, and Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts!" Folk poet Aqil Ndreu enthusiastically sang, "Mao Zedong was born in Shaoshan Village. He is the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. His brilliance shines all over the world, illuminating the hearts of the entire proletariat!"

In the early winter, Jinggangshan was covered with lush green bamboo forests, and the colorful clouds in the valleys were particularly beautiful. Red flags fluttered everywhere, and drums and gongs resounded, welcoming the guests from the land of eagles. On November 17, the Albanian comrades, following the footsteps Chairman Mao once took, visited Mao'anping, Huangyangjie, and Daping, listening to the legendary revolutionary stories. In front of the comrades, the scene of the fierce battle of "Huangyangjie Cannon Roars" seemed to unfold. They stood before the martyrs' monument and recited in unison, "Countless heroes have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their blood-stained path!" A chorus member stood before the monument and recited Chairman Mao's poem "West Lake Moon" with deep emotion. Artistic director Simon Joni also set this poem to music.

People lined up in long queues, advancing along the winding paths. Suddenly, the song "March of the Partisans" from Albania echoed through the valley: "Facing the wind and rain, treading through the mud, unafraid of hunger, how strong we are! We climb the high clouds, our songs shake the mountains and rivers. Our songs, our songs, the songs of the partisans are clear and resonant. We use songs as our food, we use songs to warm our hearts. March on! March on! Brave forward! Everywhere, the lightning-like flames are shining!" The comrades sang this heroic song, as if marching through the rugged mountains of Albania. Yes, the common revolutionary path has connected our hearts! Jinggangshan and Tomorr Mountain have nurtured our two peoples. We must ensure that the red flag of revolution always flies high. Listen to the comrades' oaths: "Every place in Jinggangshan can see the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Everything here is precious to the Albanian people, and it is an example for our youth to learn from!" "We will forever sing the loudest song, 'The East Is Red'."

Forever singing the loudest song, "The East Is Red"! This is what the comrades truly feel in their hearts! For three months, the song "The East Is Red" has echoed through every place they visited. The flower-like terraces of Dazhai, the flowing steel of Wuhan Steel, Chairman Mao's alma mater, the First Normal School of Changsha, the "pillar" of Sino-Albanian friendship, Guangzhou's Huangpu Port, the site of the first meeting of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, and the heroic city of Nanchang—all have become more magnificent and youthful in the song "The East Is Red" of the Albanian comrades. The resounding slogans on the land of China echoed: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

    永远歌颂红太阳
    阿尔巴尼亚战友无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    红山鹰
    当英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立二十二周年到来的时候，我不禁回忆起不久前同来我国访问演出的地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团同志们相处的难忘的日子，特别是阿尔巴尼亚战友们无限热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席的动人情景。
    在遥远的亚得里亚海岸，阿尔巴尼亚战友时刻仰望着红色的北京，日夜盼望见到伟大的导师毛主席。一九六七年十月一日，毛主席登上了天安门城楼，检阅首都革命群众庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的游行队伍。红色观礼台上的九十八位阿尔巴尼亚战友顿时沸腾起来了：“毛主席来了！”“毛主席万岁！”人们含着热泪跳跃欢呼，挥动双手，把鲜艳的花束抛向天空，用最响亮的歌声表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱。艺术团里十三岁的少先队员鲁米，几次跑到观礼台的尽头，向天安门城楼上眺望，但怎么也没看清毛主席在什么地方，急得她直跺脚，哭起来了。后来，她把一张毛主席像紧紧地贴在胸口，对我说：“我常常梦见毛主席，他满面红光，还向我们微笑呢。这回到中国来，我可一定要见到毛主席。”
    鲁米的心愿终于实现了。十月七日下午，最幸福的时刻到来了。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖、世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席，接见了业余艺术团全体同志，并同他们一起照了相。阿尔巴尼亚战友们是多么兴奋，多么激动啊！在被接见以后，他们脸上挂着喜悦的泪花奔走相告，同中国同志拥抱欢呼，表示这是他们一生最难忘的一天。第二天一早，在芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》中扮演吴清华和老四的演员佐·哈婥和阿·阿里雅同志，就急急忙忙地翻开报纸，把报上刊登的毛主席接见艺术团的照片剪了下来，写信寄回遥远的地拉那，向自己的亲人报喜。
    战友们这样热爱和敬仰毛主席，他们怎么能不向往红太阳升起的地方韶山，怎么能不向往革命摇篮井冈山！
    十月二十六日，晴空万里，秋高气爽，阿尔巴尼亚的战友们高唱着革命歌曲，来到了霞光万道的韶山。大家参观了毛主席旧居的每间房屋和毛主席当年使用过的每一件家具、农具。舞蹈演员哈桑激动地在毛主席使用过的桌子上留言道：“毛主席万岁！”阿·阿里雅同志一面在《毛主席语录》上盖韶山纪念图章，一面深情地说：“韶山是革命的摇篮，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳！”民间诗人阿齐斯·恩德莱乌同志热情地歌颂道：“毛泽东诞生在韶山村，他是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。全世界都闪烁着他的光辉啊，光辉把整个无产阶级的心儿照亮！”
    初冬的井冈山，遍野的竹林一片翠绿，山谷中的彩霞格外秀丽。到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，欢迎来自山鹰之国的客人。十一月十七日，阿尔巴尼亚战友踏着当年毛主席曾经走过的足迹，参观访问了茅坪、黄洋界、大井，倾听那传奇般的革命故事。在战友们的面前仿佛展现出了往日“黄洋界上炮声隆”的激战情景。他们站在烈士纪念碑前齐声朗诵：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”一位合唱队队员站在纪念碑前满怀激情地朗诵了毛主席的词《西江月·井冈山》。艺术指导西蒙·焦尼同志还把这首词谱成了歌曲。
    人们排着长长的队伍，沿着羊肠小道前进。忽然间，在山谷中响起了当年阿尔巴尼亚的《游击队进行曲》的歌声：“迎着风雨，脚踏泥浆，不怕饥饿，我们多坚强！我们攀登高高云天，歌声把山河来震荡。我们的歌声，我们的歌声啊，游击队之歌清脆又嘹亮。我们用歌声当食粮，我们用歌声暖心房。前进！前进！奋勇向前进！到处都闪耀着雷电般的火光！”战友们高唱着这支雄壮的歌曲，仿佛行进在当年战斗过的阿尔巴尼亚崇山峻岭中。是的，共同的革命道路把我们的心连在一起了！井冈山和托莫里山把我们两国人民哺育，我们一定要叫革命的红旗永远高高飘扬。请听战友们的誓言吧：“井冈山的每个地方都可以看到毛泽东思想放射的光芒。这里的一切对阿尔巴尼亚人民都是很珍贵的，是我们青年学习的榜样！”“我们要永远高唱最响亮的歌曲《东方红》。”
    永远高唱最响亮的歌曲《东方红》！这是战友们的心里话啊！三个月来，《东方红》的歌声响遍了他们到达的一切地方。如花似锦的大寨梯田，钢水奔流的武钢，毛主席的母校长沙第一师范学院，中阿友谊之桥的“桥墩”广州黄埔港，中国共产党在上海召开第一次代表大会的旧址，英雄的城市南昌，都在阿尔巴尼亚战友们《东方红》的歌声中显得更加雄伟、年轻，震天动地的口号声在中国的大地上回荡：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
