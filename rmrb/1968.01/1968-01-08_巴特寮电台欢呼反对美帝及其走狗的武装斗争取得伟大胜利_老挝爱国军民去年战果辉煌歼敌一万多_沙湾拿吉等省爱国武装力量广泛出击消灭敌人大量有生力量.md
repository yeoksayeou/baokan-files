Pathet Lao Radio Hails Great Victories in Armed Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys

Lao Patriotic Military and Civilians Achieve Splendid Results, Annihilating Over 10,000 Enemies

Patriotic Armed Forces in Savannakhet and Other Provinces Launch Wide-Ranging Attacks, Annihilating Large Numbers of Enemy Troops

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Khamkeut on the 6th, Pathet Lao Radio issued a commentary on the 1st, enthusiastically hailing the great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilians in their armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in 1967.

The commentary said: According to incomplete statistics, in 1967 (up to December 15), the military and civilians across the country conducted a total of 1,300 large and small battles, annihilating and dissolving over 12,500 enemy troops, including more than ten U.S. "advisors," more than a hundred troops from the Thai reactionary army, the Saigon puppet army, and remnants of the Kuomintang. They shot down and destroyed more than 260 U.S. aircraft, damaged hundreds more, destroyed 20 enemy vehicles, sank 56 enemy ships, damaged many more, and seized over 2,500 weapons, hundreds of tons of ammunition, and military supplies. The commentary said: The splendid achievements of 1967 surpassed any year since 1954.

The commentary pointed out: 1967 was a year of great and comprehensive victories for the Lao military and civilians. This is the result of the unity and struggle of all ethnic groups, the victory of the close cooperation between the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces, and at the same time, the result of the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee led by Prince Souphanouvong. This is the victory of the determination of the Lao military and civilians to defeat the U.S. imperialist invaders and their lackeys.

The commentary concluded: Although U.S. imperialism and its lackeys suffered a crushing defeat in 1967, due to their nature of aggression and war-mongering, they will surely play more vicious tricks in 1968. The war will become more intense. In 1968, the Lao military and civilians must further heighten their vigilance, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and bravely advance to seize even greater new victories.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Khamkeut on the 5th, Pathet Lao Radio broadcasted: The patriotic military and civilians in Savannakhet, Xaisomboun, Vientiane, and other provinces have recently launched wide-ranging attacks, annihilating many enemy troops.

The broadcast said: The patriotic armed forces in Savannakhet Province, on the night of December 24 last year, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 29th Battalion command post, artillery company, and guard company in Phalan town, and intercepted the enemy's reinforcements. In the battle, a total of 168 enemy troops were annihilated, including three U.S. invaders killed, one Thai army captain, and one captured Filipino officer. The patriotic armed forces also shot down one U.S. helicopter, destroyed 11 enemy vehicles, two radar stations, one power station, and 50 enemy barracks and warehouses, seizing two 81mm mortars and a large amount of military supplies. They also forced the enemy to withdraw from Phalan town.

The broadcast said: The patriotic military and civilians in Xaisomboun Province engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the city and suburbs of Xaisomboun on December 29 and 30 last year, killing 50 enemy troops on the spot.

A local militia and guerrilla unit in one county of Vientiane Province bravely counterattacked the enemy in Thongxay, Baphom, and other places over four days from December 7, 12, 16, and 20 last year, annihilating 59 enemy troops, seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies, and forcing the enemy to withdraw from five strongholds.

The local militia and guerrilla units in Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Xam Neua, and Sam Neua Provinces have recently frequently attacked the enemy, killing and wounding nearly 60 enemy troops.

	The Lao People's Liberation Army fights bravely, giving the invading enemy a resounding blow, and continuously annihilating the enemy's troops. The picture shows a unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army taking the initiative to attack and pursue the fleeing enemy.

    据新华社康开六日电巴特寮电台一日发表社论，热烈欢呼老挝爱国军民一九六七年在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争中取得的伟大胜利。
    社论说：据不完全统计，在一九六七年里（截至十二月十五日止），全国军民共进行大小战斗一千三百次，歼灭和瓦解敌人一万二千五百名，其中包括美国“顾问”十多名、泰国反动军队、南越伪军和蒋介石残匪上百名。击落和击毁美国飞机二百六十多架，击伤数百架，击毁敌人军车二十辆，击沉敌船五十六艘，击伤多艘，并缴获武器二千五百多件，弹药和军用物资上百吨。社论说：一九六七年的这些辉煌战绩，比一九五四年以来的任何一年都大。
    社论指出：一九六七年是老挝军民取得巨大和全面胜利的一年。这是各族人民团结战斗的结果，是老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量紧密合作的胜利，同时也是以苏发努冯亲王为首的老挝爱国战线党中央英明领导的结果。这是老挝军民战胜美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗的决心的胜利。
    社论最后说：美帝国主义及其走狗虽然在一九六七年遭到了惨败，但是由于它们的本性是侵略和好战的，所以在一九六八年，它们将会玩弄更加恶毒的阴谋。战争将会更加激烈。在一九六八年，老挝军民必须进一步提高警惕，克服一切艰难困苦，奋勇前进，夺取更加巨大的新胜利。
