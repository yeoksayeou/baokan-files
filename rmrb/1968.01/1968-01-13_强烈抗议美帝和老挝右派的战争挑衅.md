Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

January 12, 1968

On the afternoon of January 7, 1968, three bandit planes of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Laotian rightists, brazenly invaded our airspace and bombed the Miao village area in Yunnan Province, killing and injuring many of our civilians and causing severe damage to their lives and property. This is a serious war provocation by U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists against the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people strongly condemn this heinous crime committed by U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists, and strongly protest against U.S. imperialism and the Vientiane authorities.

The war provocation by U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists against our country is not an isolated or accidental event, but is closely linked to their plot to expand their aggression. In recent periods, U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage its deteriorating situation in the South Vietnamese battlefield, has repeatedly threatened to expand its aggression into Laos and Cambodia. U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression in Laos. U.S. imperialist bandit planes, including B-52 heavy bombers flying from Thai bases, are bombing the liberated areas of Laos day and night. U.S. special forces and Thai troops under its command are continuously infiltrating Laos. U.S. imperialism is also plotting to extend the so-called "fortified obstacle zone" along the 17th parallel in Vietnam into Laos, and is actively building and expanding roads and military airfields in Laos, plotting to send large numbers of U.S.-Thai ground troops into Laos to occupy the central and lower Laotian regions.

Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Laotian rightists are also actively following U.S. imperialism's criminal activities to expand the war. Recently, the Vientiane authorities in Laos have been slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, falsely claiming that the serious situation in Laos is caused by the so-called "aggression" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in collusion with U.S. imperialism. The Laotian rightist army is continuously launching military attacks on the liberated areas of Laos. Recently, under the direct planning and command of the U.S. and Thailand, the Laotian rightist army has launched a large-scale military attack on the liberated areas of Upper Laos near the China-Laos and Vietnam-Laos borders. This is a serious step by the Laotian rightists following U.S. imperialism to expand the war. While taking these military actions, U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists have openly dispatched planes to bomb our border areas, further indicating that U.S. imperialism is accelerating its pace to try to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam into Laos and its neighboring regions.

Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism's military aggression in Laos, repeatedly foiling the military attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and achieving brilliant victories. The new military adventures of U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists will surely meet with a miserable end. They will suffer even more severe defeats under the brave resistance of the Lao people.

China is a neighboring country of Laos. The Chinese people, following the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded the struggle of the Lao people as their own struggle and firmly support the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. Now, the Chinese government and people are closely watching the developments in Laos. If U.S. imperialism dares to expand its aggression into Laos, the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will take all necessary measures to support the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation until final victory.

The Chinese government and people solemnly warn U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. Since you have provoked a war against the Chinese people, you must bear all the serious consequences that arise from it.

New China News Agency, January 12th

At 3:34 PM on January 7th, three bandit planes of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Laotian rightists, invaded the airspace over the Miao village area in Yunnan Province from Laos and conducted barbaric bombing and strafing, dropping more than 20 bombs and firing rockets, killing and injuring many of our border residents and causing severe damage to their lives and property. Under the powerful counterattack of our local military and civilians, the enemy planes fled in panic towards Laos. This is an extremely serious war provocation by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Laotian rightists, against the Chinese people.

    我外交部就美帝和老挝右派悍然轰炸我云南苗寨地区发表声明
    强烈抗议美帝和老挝右派的战争挑衅
    中国政府和人民正密切注视老挝局势的发展。如果美帝胆敢把侵略战争扩大到老挝，中国人民必将采取一切必要措施，支援老挝人民抗美救国正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利
    新华社十二日讯　中华人民共和国外交部声明
              一九六八年一月十二日
    一九六八年一月七日下午，美帝国主义及其仆从老挝右派的三架强盗飞机悍然侵犯我国领空，对我云南省的苗寨地区进行了轰炸，炸死炸伤我居民多人，使我当地居民的生命财产受到严重损失。这是美帝国主义及其仆从老挝右派对中国人民所进行的一次严重的战争挑衅。中国政府和中国人民愤怒声讨美帝国主义和老挝右派所犯下的这一滔天罪行，并且向美帝国主义和老挝万象当局提出强烈的抗议。
    美帝国主义和老挝右派对我国的这次战争挑衅，绝不是孤立的、偶然的事件，而是同它扩大侵略战争的阴谋有着密切联系的。最近一个时期，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方战场的败局，一再叫嚷要把侵略越南的战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨。美帝国主义正在加紧扩大它在老挝的侵略活动。美帝国主义的强盗飞机，包括从泰国基地起飞的B52重型轰炸机在内，日以继夜地对老挝解放区进行轰炸。美国的特种部队和在它指挥下的泰国军队不断渗入老挝。美帝国主义还阴谋策划把沿越南十七度线的所谓“筑垒障碍地带”延伸到老挝，并且积极在老挝修筑和扩建公路、军用机场，阴谋派出大量美泰地面部队进入老挝，占领中、下寮地区。
    在美帝国主义的指使下，老挝右派也积极追随美帝国主义扩大战争的罪恶活动。最近，老挝万象当局大肆诬蔑越南民主共和国，胡说什么老挝严重局势是越南民主共和国的所谓“侵略”造成的，同美帝国主义一唱一和，相互呼应。老挝右派军队向老挝解放区不断发动军事进攻。最近，老挝右派军队在美、泰的直接策划和指挥下，更向靠近中老、越老边境的上寮解放区发动了大规模的军事进攻。这是老挝右派追随美帝国主义扩大战争的一个严重步骤。美帝国主义和老挝右派在采取这些军事行动的同时，公然派遣飞机轰炸我国边境地区，这就更加表明美帝国主义正在加速步伐，力图把侵略越南的战火扩大到老挝及其临近地区。
    老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，正在英勇抗击美帝国主义对老挝的军事侵略，一次又一次地粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的军事进攻，取得了辉煌的胜利。美帝国主义和老挝右派新的军事冒险，是决不会有好下场的。它们必将在老挝人民的英勇抗击下，遭到更加惨重的失败。
    中国是老挝的近邻。中国人民遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把老挝人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，坚决支持老挝人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。现在，中国政府和中国人民正密切注视老挝局势的发展。如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争扩大到老挝，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，必将采取一切必要的措施，支援老挝人民抗美救国的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    中国政府和中国人民严正警告美帝国主义和老挝右派，中国人民不是好惹的，你们既然对中国人民进行了战争挑衅，你们就必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
    新华社十二日讯　一月七日下午三时三十四分，美帝国主义及其仆从老挝右派的三架强盗飞机，自老挝方向侵入我国云南省苗寨地区上空，进行了野蛮的轰炸和扫射，投掷炸弹和发射火箭二十多枚，炸死炸伤我边境居民多人，使我当地居民的生命财产遭到严重损失。在我当地军民的有力回击下，敌机慌忙向老挝方向逃去。这是美帝国主义及其仆从老挝右派对中国人民进行的一次极其严重的战争挑衅。
