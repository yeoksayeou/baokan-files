    The Thai reactionary regime is plotting to force Vietnamese overseas in Thailand to return to South Vietnam to serve as American cannon fodder. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry has lodged a strong protest.

    According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 14, strongly protesting the negotiations between the Thai reactionary regime and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, plotting to forcibly repatriate over 40,000 Vietnamese overseas in Thailand according to the American plan.

    The statement said that the Thai ruling authorities may soon expel some Vietnamese overseas who have been illegally detained in several provinces in northeastern Thailand and hand them over to the Saigon puppet regime.

    The statement pointed out that the Thai reactionary regime, in collusion with the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, is forcing Vietnamese overseas to return to South Vietnam, serving the conscription plot of the American-Saigon authorities, attempting to use this to reverse the deteriorating situation and plight of the American puppet regime in South Vietnam.

    The statement said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam severely condemns and strongly protests the cruel actions taken by the Thai ruling clique against Vietnamese overseas, and at the same time, firmly demands that they immediately stop colluding with the Saigon puppet authorities to force Vietnamese overseas to go to South Vietnam.

    The statement finally warned that the Thai authorities must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from their actions of persecuting Vietnamese overseas.

    泰国反动当局阴谋把旅泰越侨强迫遣返南越充当美帝炮灰
    越南外交部提出强烈抗议
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人十四日发表声明，强烈抗议泰国反动当局同南越阮文绍—阮高其集团谈判，阴谋把四万多名旅泰越侨按照美国的计划强迫遣返南越。
    声明说，泰国统治当局可能在最近就把他们过去在泰国东北部数省非法拘留的一些越南侨民赶出泰国，交给西贡傀儡政权。
    声明指出，泰国反动当局勾结阮文绍—阮高其集团迫使越南侨民返回南越，是为美国—西贡当局的征兵阴谋服务，企图借此挽回美伪集团在南越的败局和困境。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部严厉谴责并强烈抗议泰国统治集团对越南侨民采取的残酷行动，同时坚决要求他们立即停止串通西贡傀儡当局，强迫越南侨民去到南越的阴谋。
    声明最后警告说，泰国当局必须对由于他们迫害越南侨民的行动所产生的一切后果负完全责任。
