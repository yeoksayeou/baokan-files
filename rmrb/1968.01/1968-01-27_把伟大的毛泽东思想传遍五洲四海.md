	January 26th was the happiest and most unforgettable day of my life. I once again saw our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao was radiant, full of vigor, and walked steadily towards us. My blood boiled, tears of joy filled my eyes, and I couldn't help but shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao! I wish Chairman Mao a long life! Ten thousand years of life!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! A thousand words, ten thousand words cannot express my boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you.

	It is you who saved me, a poor peasant's child, from the fire and nurtured me to grow, to fly for the people across the world's blue skies.

	It is your brilliant thoughts that educate me to have a heart for the motherland, to look at the world, to serve all the people of China and all the revolutionary people of the world.

	Dear Chairman Mao, your brilliant thoughts are the banner of the times, the great truth, the spark of revolution, the direction of progress, and the guarantee of victory. Every time we fly, we always put the propagation of your thoughts first. Wherever we fly, we spread your brilliant thoughts there. We deeply feel that enthusiastically propagating your thoughts is the best way to serve the revolutionary people of the world.

	Dear Chairman Mao, the people of the world think of you day and night, yearning for your brilliant thoughts day and night. With you, with your brilliant thoughts, the people of the world have light and hope. When I flew over many countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, how many foreign friends tightly held my hand, asking me to convey their warmest greetings to you, wishing you a long life! Ten thousand years of life! When I reached Albania, the socialist beacon of Europe, the Albanian comrades, to express their boundless love and respect for you, shouted with us again and again: "Enver, Mao Zedong! Enver, Mao Zedong!" Many Burmese friends, to be able to see your brilliant and great image frequently, broke through layer upon layer of obstacles to ask us for the most precious gift: Chairman Mao's badge. They were not afraid of the persecution of the military police and special agents, wore the badge on their chests, and felt that their fighting confidence and strength had increased infinitely. On Red Square in Moscow, a demobilized Soviet soldier excitedly told me: "You have the wise leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong, which is the greatest happiness." A friend from Tanzania said that Chairman Mao is the savior of the people of the world, and the revolutionary people of the world can only achieve victory by following the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. A friend from Pakistan said: Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! My heart's words, a thousand words, ten thousand words cannot be said, converging into an ironclad oath: Forever loyal to you, loyal to your brilliant thoughts, loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. Live to fight for your revolutionary line, die to dedicate to your revolutionary line.

    把伟大的毛泽东思想传遍五洲四海
    空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子
    代表大会代表、民航某飞行大队大队长  徐柏龄
    一月二十六日，是我一生中最最幸福最最难忘的日子。我又一次见到了我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，迈着稳健的步伐向我们走来。我全身热血沸腾，喜泪盈眶，情不自禁地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语，表达不完我对您老人家的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
    是您把我这个贫农的孩子，从火海中拯救出来，培育成长，为人民飞向世界的蓝空。
    是您的光辉思想，教育我胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为全中国人民和全世界革命人民服务。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，您的光辉思想，是时代的旗帜，伟大的真理，革命的火种，前进的方向，胜利的保证。我们每一次飞行，总是要把宣传您的思想放在首位。我们飞到那里，就把您的光辉思想传播到那里。我们深深感到，热情宣传您的思想，就是最好的为世界革命人民服务。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，世界人民日夜在想念您，日夜渴望您的光辉思想。有了您，有了您的光辉思想，世界人民就有了光明，有了希望。当我飞越亚、非、欧许多国家的时候，多少外国朋友紧握住我的手，要我向您老人家致以最亲切的问候，敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！当我到达欧洲的社会主义明灯阿尔巴尼亚的时候，阿尔巴尼亚的同志为了表达对您的无比热爱、无比崇敬的感情，和我们一起一遍又一遍地热烈欢呼：“恩维尔，毛泽东！恩维尔，毛泽东！”许多缅甸朋友为了能经常见到您光辉伟大的形象，冲破了层层阻碍，向我们要最珍贵的礼物：毛主席像章。他们不怕军警特务的迫害，把像章戴在胸前，感到增加了无穷的斗争信心和力量。在莫斯科红场上，一个苏联复员军人激动地对我说：“你们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，真是最大的幸福。”一位坦桑尼亚的朋友说，毛主席是世界人民的大救星，世界革命人民只有按照毛主席指出的革命道路前进才能取得胜利。一个巴基斯坦的朋友说：毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我的心里话，千言万语说不完，汇成一个钢铁般的誓言：永远忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。生为您的革命路线而战斗，死为您的革命路线而献身。
