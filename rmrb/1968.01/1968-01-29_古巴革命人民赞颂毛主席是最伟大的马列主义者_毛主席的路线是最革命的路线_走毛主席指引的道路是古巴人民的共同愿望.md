Cuban revolutionary people praise Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist. Chairman Mao's line is the most revolutionary line. Following the path indicated by Chairman Mao is the common aspiration of the Cuban people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Havana: “We love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao's thoughts are absolutely correct; every word he says is the truth. Chairman Mao's line is the most revolutionary line. We want to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao; this is our common aspiration.” These are the heartfelt words of a Cuban friend. They express the Cuban revolutionary people's boundless love for Chairman Mao and reflect the common aspiration of the Cuban revolutionary people.

We like to wear Chairman Mao badges

Once, a Chinese comrade was walking on the street when a Cuban friend suddenly jumped down from a truck. He said to the Chinese comrade: “Can you give me two Chairman Mao badges? My two friends have long been eager to get Chairman Mao badges.”

He continued: “Three months ago, I got a Chairman Mao badge. I have always worn the Chairman Mao badge on my hat, which shows my respect and love for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, and also the red sun in the hearts of our Cuban people. We love Chairman Mao and like to wear Chairman Mao badges.”

Chairman Mao's thoughts are the most correct

One day, on a bus traveling through the streets of Havana, a Cuban youth was deeply engrossed in reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He was marking various passages with a red pen. At this time, another Cuban friend asked him what book he was reading and why he was reading it so seriously. The Cuban youth replied: “Chairman Mao's thoughts are the most correct. Every word of Chairman Mao is an unshakable truth. Therefore, I will always read Chairman Mao's books and act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, following the path indicated by Chairman Mao.”

Long live Chairman Mao forever!

One day, several Cuban friends brought a portrait of Chairman Mao to visit Chinese friends. They excitedly told the Chinese friends: “We personally drew a portrait of Chairman Mao to express our love for Chairman Mao and to show how much we cherish the great friendship between the peoples of Cuba and China.” Then, the Cuban worker who personally drew the portrait of Chairman Mao said: The radiant light of the red sun in the hearts of the world's people—Chairman Mao—illuminates the people of the five continents. Their hearts are all turned towards Chairman Mao. They all wish the red sun in the hearts of the world's people—Chairman Mao—long live forever! Long live forever!

We believe in Chairman Mao's words

One day, more than ten Cuban workers met a Chinese comrade and expressed their boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao, praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and extolling the fighting friendship between the peoples of Cuba and China. One worker said: “The Cuban people and the Chinese people have both experienced similar hardships, and today we have the same enemies. We are brothers and comrades in arms.” Another worker said: “We are very concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Although the enemy constantly slanders and spreads rumors about the Cultural Revolution, we believe in Chairman Mao's words: ‘Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.’ Therefore, we support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.” An elderly retired worker said passionately: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented great feat. This Cultural Revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of Chinese people to launch a fierce attack on the filth left over from the old society. China has such a great leader and such revolutionary people; the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China will definitely advance to victory.” He also expressed his belief that because there is Chairman Mao, communism will definitely be realized throughout the world.
