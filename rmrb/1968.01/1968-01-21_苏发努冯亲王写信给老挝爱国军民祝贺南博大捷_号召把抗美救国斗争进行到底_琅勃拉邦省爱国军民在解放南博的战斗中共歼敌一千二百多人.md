Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, wrote a letter on January 17 to the patriotic military and people of Laos, congratulating them on the great victory at Nam Bao. He called on them to use all their weapons, display courage and wisdom, and press on to decisively carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end.

The letter said: The great victory at Nam Bao has enormous strategic significance for the Lao people's anti-American national salvation cause. It is also a heavy blow to American imperialism. The great victory at Nam Bao has proven that the patriotic spirit of the Lao people and their courage and determination to defend the liberated areas are forces that no enemy can defeat.

The letter said: The more defeats American imperialism suffers, the more frantically it will struggle. At present, it is plotting new military adventures to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula. Prince Souphanouvong emphasized in the letter: The Lao people will not be shaken by any threats and will not yield to any pressure. American imperialism is the aggressor in Laos. The Lao people must resolutely carry the struggle against the aggressors to the end.

The letter called on all the people in the liberated areas of Laos to actively fight and produce, and build the liberated areas into strong bases.

In conclusion, Prince Souphanouvong pointed out in the letter that the Lao people's anti-American national salvation cause is glorious and just. With the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the Lao people will surely win!

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kengtung on January 19, the heroic patriotic military and people of Louangphrabang Province, from January 12 to 16, launched a fierce attack on the 5,000 rightist Lao troops stationed in the Nam Bao area, annihilating 1,216 enemy soldiers and shooting down one enemy aircraft. On January 14 alone, local patriotic military and people annihilated more than 700 enemy soldiers. The great victory at Nam Bao is the biggest victory won by the Lao patriotic armed forces since the dry season.

During these days of battle, the patriotic military and people of Louangphrabang Province also captured 605 various weapons, including 50 recoilless guns and mortars.

The remnants of the enemy, who were beaten to a pulp by the patriotic military and people of Louangphrabang Province, fled in disarray into the nearby jungle but were pursued and suffered heavy losses by the Lao patriotic armed forces.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kengtung on January 19, a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on January 16 strongly condemning American imperialism's savage bombing of the Xam Nuea Hospital on January 10 and 14, killing and injuring 31 medical staff and patients. The statement pointed out that American imperialism's savage act further escalated its aggression against Laos and attempted to reverse its increasingly heavy defeats in Laos and Vietnam.

The statement stressed: The Lao people will never forget the above savage crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys, and are determined to make them pay the blood debt and thoroughly smash all their "creeping" attack plots.

    信中说：南博大捷对老挝人民的抗美救国事业具有巨大的战略意义，同时也是对美帝国主义的一个沉重打击。南博大捷证明了老挝人民的爱国精神和保卫解放区的勇敢和坚决精神，是任何敌人都不能战胜的力量。
    信中说：美帝国主义越遭到惨败，就越要进行疯狂的挣扎。目前，它正在阴谋进行新的军事冒险，以便把战争扩大到整个印度支那。苏发努冯亲王在信中强调指出：老挝人民决不会为任何恫吓所动摇，也决不会向任何压力屈服。美帝国主义是老挝的侵略者。老挝人民必须坚决地把抗击侵略者的斗争进行到底。
    信中号召老挝解放区全体人民积极战斗和生产，把解放区建设成为坚强的根据地。
    苏发努冯亲王最后在信中指出，老挝人民的抗美救国事业是光荣的、正义的，在全世界人民的同情和支持下，老挝人民必胜！
    据新华社康开十九日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，英勇的老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民，从一月十二日到十六日在南博地区，猛烈袭击盘踞在那里的五千名老挝右派军队，共歼灭敌人一千二百十六名，击落敌机一架。仅在十四日一天，当地爱国军民就歼敌七百多名。南博大捷是老挝爱国武装力量自旱季以来赢得的最大胜利。
    在这几天战斗中，琅勃拉邦省爱国军民还缴获各种武器六百零五件，其中包括无后座力炮和迫击炮五十门。
    被琅勃拉邦省爱国军民打得焦头烂额的残敌从南博狼狈逃入附近丛林，但又遭到老挝爱国武装力量的追击，损失惨重。
    新华社康开十九日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十六日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义十日和十四日连续派遣飞机野蛮轰炸老挝桑怒医院，炸死、炸伤医务人员和病人三十一人的野蛮罪行。声明指出，美帝国主义的这一疯狂行动，进一步加剧了对老挝的侵略战争，妄图挽救它在老挝和越南的日益惨重的失败。
    声明强调说：老挝人民将永远不会忘记美帝国主义及其走狗的上述野蛮罪行，决心要它们偿还血债，彻底粉碎它们的一切“蚕食”进攻阴谋。
