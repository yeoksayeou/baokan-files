The nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in a great situation, not a small one. The overall situation is better than ever before. A key indicator of this great situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been so widespread and so deep.

The People of Jinggangshan Carry Forward the Glorious Revolutionary Tradition and Turn Mao Zedong Thought into Conscious Revolutionary Action

Jiangxi Witnesses a New Situation of Widespread Propagation and Popularization of Mao Zedong Thought

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang, the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, striven to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, creating a new situation where Mao Zedong Thought is widely propagated and popularized among millions of people.

Over the past year, Jiangxi's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been the most intense and fierce year of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. It has also been a year of unprecedented widespread propagation and deep penetration of Mao Zedong Thought into the hearts of the people, and a year of unprecedented rise in the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses. The heroic people of Jinggangshan, in the heart-pounding class struggle, have eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and his important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. In their struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in the days of white terror under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, in the fight against the counter-revolutionary restoration tide, in carrying out the revolutionary criticism, achieving revolutionary unity, and implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and in executing the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," "support the army and love the people," and "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," they have all striven to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They say: arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought is a lifelong matter for oneself; it is a matter of great importance for the proletarian revolutionary cause; it is a matter of great importance for ten thousand years and for all future generations.

The people of Jinggangshan, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loving of Mao Zedong Thought, and have the deepest understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the Cultural Revolution, they have linked the actual class struggle with their own thoughts, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to break down selfishness and establish public spirit. Song Ximing is a young intellectual who returned to his hometown after graduating from high school ten years ago to participate in socialist construction. In July of the previous year, soon after he was transferred to the position of deputy secretary of the old Jinxian County Committee, he responded to Chairman Mao's call and actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the county committee who were pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. After the threats and bribes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party failed, they sent him to a remote mountain village for supervision and labor. At this moment, Song Ximing, full of passion, studied Chairman Mao's works over and over again, recited Chairman Mao's quotations, and gained boundless strength, determined to fight to the end with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. He lived, worked, and labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points together, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the evil plots of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving new merits in the Cultural Revolution.

The heroic people of Jinggangshan, in every round of struggle in the Cultural Revolution, have brought the various problems of class struggle to Chairman Mao's works to find answers. They say that studying Chairman Mao's works in this way, combining study with practice, yields immediate results, is most deeply imprinted in the mind, absorbed into the blood, and implemented in action. Hu Xuekai, a cadre from Shuangxi Brigade, Yangqiao Commune, Yongxin County, saw the fiery Cultural Revolution sweep through cities and countryside when he saw the Red Guards rise up to rebel against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and big-character posters were plastered all over the village, his mind was confused for a while. He brought his ideological problems to Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." When he read Mao Zedong's evaluation of the peasants' rebellion in the countryside as "very good" and refuted the "hooligan movement" argument, he linked it to the Red Guards in the village who were all children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and they had a heart full of limitless love for Chairman Mao, his mind immediately became clear. The more he studied, the more he realized that the revolutionary big-character posters were good, the revolutionary actions of the masses were good, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses were good. Chairman Mao's teachings were like a bright lamp that suddenly illuminated his mind. From then on, Hu Xuekai firmly stood with the revolutionary faction, unshakably followed Chairman Mao, and advanced courageously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the people of Jinggangshan set up more than ten thousand Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They took "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, launched a larger-scale mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and built Jiangxi into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。
    井冈山儿女发扬光荣的革命传统  把毛泽东思想变为自觉革命行动
    江西出现毛泽东思想大传播大普及的新局面
    据新华社南昌电　江西省广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，开创了伟大的毛泽东思想在千百万人民群众中空前大传播、大普及的崭新局面。
    江西一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最尖锐、最激烈的一年，也是毛泽东思想空前大普及、大深入人心的一年，也是广大革命群众无产阶级觉悟空前大提高的一年。英雄的井冈山儿女在惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重要指示。他们把学习毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上。在同党内一小撮走资派的斗争中，在粉碎资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖的日子里，在击退反革命复辟逆流的搏斗中，在开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命三结合的过程中，在执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“拥军爱民”和“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召中，他们都努力活学活用毛泽东思想。他们说：用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，对自己来说，是一生的大计，是管一生一世的大事；对无产阶级革命事业来说，是万年的大计，是管千秋万代的大事。
    具有光荣革命传统的井冈山儿女，最忠于毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线领会最深。他们在文化大革命中，联系阶级斗争的实际，联系自己的思想实际，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，破私立公。宋喜明，是十年前高中毕业后回乡参加社会主义建设的知识青年。前年七月，他调任旧金溪县委副书记不久，响应毛主席的号召，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命，揭露了县委内一小撮走资派推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。党内一小撮走资派对他进行威胁、利诱都遭到失败后，又把他押送到一个偏僻的山村监督劳动。在这样的时刻，宋喜明满怀激情地一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作，默诵毛主席语录，浑身增添了无穷的力量，决心与党内一小撮走资派斗争到底。他和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，一起活学活用毛主席著作和十六条，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，揭露党内一小撮走资派的罪恶阴谋，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在文化大革命中立了新功。
    英雄的井冈山儿女在文化大革命每个回合的搏斗中，都带着阶级斗争中的各种问题，到毛主席著作中寻找答案。他们说，这样学习毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影，最能刻印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。永新县杨桥公社双溪大队干部胡学开，当文化大革命的熊熊烈火烧遍城乡时，他看见红卫兵起来造党内一小撮走资派的反，大字报贴了满村，思想一时纳闷得很。他带着思想上的问题，打开了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》。当他读到毛主席对农民在乡里造反的评价是“好得很”并且驳斥了“痞子运动”之说时，他联系到村里的红卫兵全是贫下中农子弟，他们对毛主席有颗无限热爱的红心，心里立即开朗起来。他越学越认识到革命的大字报好，群众的革命行动好，红卫兵和革命群众好。毛主席的教导象盏明灯，一下照亮了他的思想。从此，胡学开坚定地与革命派站在一起，毫不动摇地紧跟毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命中勇往直前。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，井冈山儿女办起了一万多个毛泽东思想学习班。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，掀起了更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把江西建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
