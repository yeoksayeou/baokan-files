In a Sunday near Kun Tian in South Vietnam, the American aggressor's "observation post" suddenly "discovered a group of South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers, neither too many nor too few." Thus, the "Marine Corps" hurriedly "sent out two companies to track them." However, "the discovered unit was merely a bait for a large-scale ambush." As a result, disaster struck, "a company of the Marine Corps was attacked, cut into three parts, and virtually annihilated. The other company also suffered heavy casualties."

This is a recent account by an Associated Press reporter of the annihilation of a unit of U.S. troops in South Vietnam. This is just one of the countless battles in South Vietnam, a very ordinary one.

On the battlefield of South Vietnam, the American bandits are increasingly struggling in the vast sea of people's war. American reactionary newspapers helplessly lament that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people are "coordinating military operations" across the entire battlefield, able to "freely maneuver U.S. troops," while the U.S. aggressor troops can only be "forced to turn in a full circle," taking blows from all directions. They admit in despair that "this war is very mysterious," "like fighting with an opponent hidden behind a curtain," suffering defeats but "not knowing" what the opponent "looks like," while their counterattacks often "miss the mark." These comments vividly reflect the American aggressors' desperate and pathetic plight.

Our great leader Chairman Mao once vividly and vividly described the strategy of protracted war: "We must seal the enemy's eyes and ears as much as possible, making them blind and deaf, and confuse their commanders as much as possible, making them mad, in order to achieve our victory." The heroic people of South Vietnam are doing just that. They creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, roaming freely and appearing and disappearing suddenly, firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield, and skillfully engaging in a contest of wits with the contemporary self-proclaimed "strongest" American aggressors, making them "blind," "deaf," and "mad," continuously achieving one victory after another. Once the U.S. aggressor troops set foot on South Vietnamese soil, they are surrounded by 14 million South Vietnamese military and civilians, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, flailing about, and can only take blows passively. The American bandits try to rely on indiscriminate bombing and ruthless "sweeping" to reverse the situation, but the more they go mad, the more they suffer heavy defeats.

The U.S. aggressor troops, plagued by blindness and deafness, try to resort to so-called "scientific ears and eyes" like "electronic machines," "photographic reconnaissance," and "infrared devices" to gather the "intelligence" they need, revealing their desperation.

The reason why the U.S. aggressors are blind and deaf, taking blows passively, is that they are in a position opposed to the 14 million people of South Vietnam. They not only do not get the support of the masses but also face the heavy encirclement and blockade of the broad masses of people. The American aggressors' desperate situation is not something that can be changed by any modern tools.

On the vast battlefield of South Vietnam, in this vivid and magnificent people's war drama directed by the heroic people of South Vietnam, American imperialism plays the pathetic roles of the "blind," the "deaf," and the "mad." If the Vietnamese people persist and fight a protracted war, then this drama will definitely end with the final victory of the Vietnamese people and the final defeat of the American "blind," "deaf," and "mad."

    “瞎子”、“聋子”和“疯子”
    郭辛兵
    越南南方的一个星期天，昆天附近的美国侵略军“监视哨”，突然“发现一支人数不多不少”的南越解放军。于是，“海军陆战队”慌慌忙忙地“派出两个连去跟踪”。谁知，“所发现的这支部队只是作为进行大规模伏击的诱饵”。结果，祸从天降，“海军陆战队的一个连遭到了袭击，被切成三段，并且实际上被歼了。另外一个连伤亡也很大。”
    这是不久以前美联社记者叙述的一支侵越美军被歼的简单经过。这不过是越南南方战场上成千成万个战例之中极其寻常的一个。
    在南越战场上，美国强盗日益艰难地挣扎在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。美国反动报刊无可奈何地悲叹，越南南方人民武装在整个战场上
  “统筹军事行动”，可以“任意调动美军”，而美国侵略军只能“被迫在三百六十度的周围”团团打转，到处挨揍。它们沮丧地承认“这场战争是很玄的”，“好象是同一个躲在帘幕后面的对手比拳”，吃了苦头却“不知道”对手
  “是什么样子”，而自己的回击则往往“扑了空”。上述这些议论，淋漓尽致地反映出美国侵略者焦头烂额的狼狈相。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在论述持久战的作战方针时说过生动而又形象的一段话：“我们要把敌人的眼睛和耳朵尽可能地封住，使他们变成瞎子和聋子，要把他们的指挥员的心尽可能地弄得混乱些，使他们变成疯子，用以争取自己的胜利。”英雄的越南南方人民正是这样。他们创造性地运用了人民战争的战略战术，纵横驰骋，神出鬼没，牢牢掌握着战场上的主动权，灵活巧妙地同当代号称最“强大”的美国侵略者周旋，使它变“瞎”、变“聋”、变“疯”，不断地取得一个又一个胜利。而美国侵略军一踏上南越的土地，就置身一千四百万越南南方军民的包围之中，视而不见，听而不闻，手足失措，只能盲目乱撞，被动挨打。美国强盗企图依靠狂轰滥炸、残酷“扫荡”来挽救败局，结果它越是发疯，越遭到惨重的失败。
    美国侵略军苦于目瞽耳聩，想要乞灵于什么“电子机器”、“摄影侦察”、“红外线装置”等所谓“科学的耳目”，来搜集所需的“情报”，这活现出其黔驴技穷的窘态。
    美国侵略者之所以耳目不灵，被动挨打，是因为他们处于同一千四百万越南南方人民相对立的地位，不仅完全得不到人民群众的支持，而且遭到了广大人民群众的重重包围和封锁。美国侵略者的这种狼狈的处境，决不是靠任何现代化工具所能改变的。
    在南越广阔的战争舞台上，在由英雄的越南南方人民导演的这一出有声有色、威武雄壮的人民战争戏剧里，美帝国主义扮演着“瞎子”、“聋子”、
  “疯子”的可悲角色。越南人民坚持下去，持久作战，那末这出戏剧就一定以越南人民的最后胜利，美国“瞎子”、“聋子”、“疯子”的最后失败而告终。
