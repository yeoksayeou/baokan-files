Under the warm care of our great leader Chairman Mao, and guided by Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, the revolutionary committee of Gansu Province, a key area in the northwestern highlands and a frontline in the struggle against revisionism, has been born triumphantly amidst the storm of class struggle.

The establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee declares the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Gansu such as Wang Feng, to restore capitalism. It signifies a decisive victory in the great struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and oppose the restoration of capitalism in the Gansu region. This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resonating across the northwestern highlands!

We extend our warmest congratulations and highest respects to the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Gansu!

Chairman Mao said: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns."

The birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee is the result of repeated struggles and tenacious battles against a handful of class enemies. Although the enemy is cunning, the struggle is arduous, and the road is tortuous, the proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu, with their loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have overcome countless difficulties, forged ahead courageously, defeated the enemy's various counterattacks, and smashed their plot to use bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks. Under the leadership of the working class, they have continuously promoted revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in the struggle, ultimately achieving a decisive victory in the proletarian revolutionary struggle for power.

The People's Liberation Army fighting on the frontlines of the "three supports, two militaries" in Gansu Province has poured their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao into the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the repeated implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. They continually use Mao Zedong Thought to unify their thoughts and actions, seriously implement the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions." They have traversed the mountains of Gansu, deeply entering factories, villages, schools, and institutions, spreading Chairman Mao's voice, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, doing thorough and detailed ideological and political work, actively helping the broad revolutionary masses to correctly handle the two types of different contradictions, criticize and repudiate revisionism, eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and guide petty-bourgeois thinking onto the track of proletarian revolution. They have established new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At every critical moment in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province, they have received the brilliant instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. The experience of the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province can be summed up in one point: to be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to listen well to Chairman Mao's words, to follow Chairman Mao's every battle command tightly and resolutely execute it. To the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, one must frequently and truthfully report the situation, seek instructions often, and make reports, never be self-righteous or act on one's own. With the greatest enthusiasm, the strongest resolve, and the fastest speed, Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be solidly implemented at the grassroots level, turning into the conscious actions of the broad masses.

The spring wind has reached the Jade Gate Pass, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is also advancing victoriously with the momentum of splitting bamboo. We hope that the newly born Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, will become a strong command center to lead the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter should strive to be a model in learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must further extensively carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, further carry forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, and vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, clause by clause and comprehensively. We must criticize and repudiate revisionism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism that interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and hinders the execution of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must summon up our strength, strive to be in the forefront, resolutely implement the various battle tasks for 1968 proposed by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

    春风已到玉门关
    ——热烈欢呼甘肃省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，我国西北高原要地、反修斗争前哨之一——甘肃省的革命委员会，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生了。
    甘肃省革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在甘肃的代理人汪锋之流复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋的彻底破产，标志着巩固无产阶级专政、反对资本主义复辟的伟大斗争在甘肃地区的决定性胜利。这是西北高原上又一曲振奋人心的毛泽东思想的凯歌！
    我们谨向具有光荣革命传统的甘肃省各族人民和驻甘肃的人民解放军表示最热烈的祝贺，致以崇高的敬礼！
    毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”
    甘肃省革命委员会的诞生，是同一小撮阶级敌人反复较量和顽强搏斗的结果。尽管敌人是狡猾的，斗争是艰苦的，道路是曲折的，但是，甘肃无产阶级革命派凭着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，靠着威力无比的毛泽东思想，在解放军的坚强支持下，排除万难，勇往直前，打败了阶级敌人的种种反扑，粉碎了他们利用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性破坏革命队伍团结的阴谋，在工人阶级的带头下，不断在斗争中促进革命的大联合和革命的三结合，终于取得了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的决定性的胜利。
    战斗在甘肃省“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军，把对毛主席深厚的阶级感情，倾注在对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚决贯彻上，倾注在对毛主席一系列最新指示的反复落实上。他们不断地用毛泽东思想统一自己的思想和行动，认真执行“支左不支派”的原则。他们踏遍甘肃高原万重山，深入工厂、农村、学校、机关，传播毛主席的声音，贯彻毛主席的指示，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，做好深入细致的思想政治工作，积极帮助广大革命群众正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，斗私、批修，破除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了新的功勋。
    甘肃省无产阶级文化大革命发展的每一个关键时刻，都得到伟大领袖毛主席的光辉指示。甘肃省无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的经验，归结到一点，就是要对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，好好听毛主席的话，对毛主席的每一个战斗号令，都紧紧跟上，坚决执行。对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，要经常地如实地反映情况，多请示，多报告，绝不自以为是，自作主张。要以最大的热情，最强的决心，最快的速度，把毛主席的最新指示，扎扎实实地落到基层，变成广大群众的自觉行动。
    春风已到玉门关，全国无产阶级文化大革命，也正以破竹之势胜利向前发展。我们希望新生的甘肃省革命委员会，以毛主席最新指示为纲，成为带动广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的坚强指挥部。每一个无产阶级革命派战士，都要力争成为学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。要更加广泛地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，进一步发扬毛主席倡导的革命好学风，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。真正做到把毛主席的最新指示，条条落实、全面落实。要斗私批修，增强无产阶级党性，把干扰毛主席伟大战略部署、妨碍毛主席最新指示执行的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性打倒。要鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部提出的一九六八年的各项战斗任务，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
