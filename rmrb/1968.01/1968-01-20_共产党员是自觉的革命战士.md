Communist Party Members Are Conscious Revolutionary Fighters

	The Party branch committee member and director of Daqiao Production Brigade, Jia Chengran

	Chairman Mao teaches us:

	"The vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members is very important." "The words and actions of Communist Party members must be judged by whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by the broadest masses of the people." We Party members of Daqiao Production Brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, in the struggle to build socialist New Daqiao, are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, not afraid of death, and lead in everything, at all times, and in all places. However, the Chinese Khrushchev says: "Party members and leading cadres 'participate in some production labor, not for the purpose of creating value, but to change the public's impression.' This is a slander against our Communist Party members and a poison to disintegrate our Party's ranks.

	The Party members of our Daqiao lead in participating in collective production labor to forever maintain the character of the working people, to produce more grain to support national construction, and to support the liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world. It is not, as the Chinese Khrushchev says, to put on a show for the masses to change the masses' 'impression' and deceive the trust of the masses. I am a member of the brigade Party branch committee and also the brigade director. I deeply feel that Party cadres actively participating in collective production labor can lead production and achieve a double harvest in ideological work and production. Actively participating in collective production labor can strengthen the connection with the masses, listen to the criticisms of the brigade members at any time, and be able to conduct living ideological education for the brigade members. Our Party members actively participate in labor, not only to increase social wealth, but more importantly, to prevent Party members and cadres from becoming corrupt and to avoid revisionism. What is participating in production labor to change the masses' 'impression' and to show off to the masses? That is completely a reactionary fallacy, aiming to lead our Communist Party members astray from the masses, to be two-faced, and to go down the corrupt path.

	If the Party members of our Daqiao Production Brigade had not, over the past ten or twenty years, followed Chairman Mao's teachings to take the lead in participating in collective production labor and fighting against class enemies, but had done as the Chinese Khrushchev said, laboring to put on a show and change the masses' 'impression,' then our Daqiao Party members would not have taken root among the masses, would not have a mass base, would not have today's core role of the Daqiao Party branch, and would not have today's thriving socialist New Daqiao.

	There are indeed people who labor and work to show off to others and to deceive the trust of the Party and the masses. Those are some conspirators, careerists, traitors, and turncoats who have infiltrated the Party. The Chinese Khrushchev is such a person, and the bourgeois element Wang X who was praised by him and created the "Peach Garden Experience" is also such a person. No matter how much these people disguise themselves or how many times they put on a show for others, the masses will not be fooled, and their true faces will eventually be exposed. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, haven't their ugly souls been exposed in broad daylight?

	Mao Zedong Thought will forever be our guiding light. We must strive to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good fighters of Chairman Mao. We must overthrow and expose the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and forever maintain the proletarian vanguard role.

    共产党员是自觉的革命战士
    大寨大队党支部委员大队长  贾承让
    毛主席教导我们说：
  “共产党员的先锋作用和模范作用是十分重要的。”“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”我们大寨大队的党员，按照毛主席的教导，在建设社会主义的新大寨的斗争中，不怕苦，不怕累，不怕死，事事带头，时时带头，处处带头。中国赫鲁晓夫却说什么：党员和负责干部“参加一些生产劳动，目的不在于创造多少价值，而在于改变群众观感”。这是对我们共产党员的诬蔑，是瓦解我们党的队伍的毒剂。
    我们大寨的党员带头参加集体生产劳动，是为了永远保持劳动人民的本色，为了多打粮食支援国家建设，支援世界被压迫人民的翻身解放。决不是象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样做做样子给群众看，改变群众的“观感”，骗取群众的信任。我是大队党支部委员，又是大队长。我深深体会到，党员干部积极参加集体生产劳动，才能领导生产，取得思想工作和生产双丰收。积极参加集体生产劳动，才能加强同群众的联系，随时随地听取社员的批评意见，并能够对社员进行活的思想教育。我们党员积极参加劳动，不仅能增加社会财富，更重要的是能够防止党员、干部变质，避免出修正主义。什么参加生产劳动是为了改变群众“观感”，是为了给群众看，那完全是反动谬论，是妄想把我们共产党员引上脱离群众，当面一套、背后一套，发霉变质的邪路上去。
    我们大寨大队的党员，一、二十年来如果不是按照毛主席的教导，在参加集体生产劳动和同阶级敌人进行斗争中起带头作用，而是象中国赫鲁晓夫说的那样，劳动是为了装门面，作样子，改变群众的“观感”，那么，我们大寨的党员，在群众中就不会扎下根子，就不会有群众基础，也就不会有今天这样能够起核心作用的大寨党支部，更不会有今天欣欣向荣的社会主义新大寨。
    劳动、工作是为了给别人看，以骗取党和群众的信任，这种人是有的，那就是一些钻进党内来的阴谋家、野心家、叛徒、自首变节分子。中国赫鲁晓夫是这种人，被他吹捧的那个炮制“桃园经验”的资产阶级分子王××也是这种人。这样的人，不管他们伪装得多么象，作过多少次样子给别人看，群众决不会上他们的当，他们的面貌终究要暴露出来。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们的丑恶灵魂不是暴露在光天化日之下了吗？
    毛泽东思想永远是我们的指路明灯，我们一定要努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我们要把中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论批倒、批臭，永远保持无产阶级先锋队的本色。
