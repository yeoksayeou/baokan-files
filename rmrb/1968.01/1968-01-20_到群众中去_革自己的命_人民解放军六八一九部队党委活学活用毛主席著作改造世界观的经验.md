The Party Committee of the 6819 Unit of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, went among the masses, engaged in "self-criticism and anti-revisionism," and transformed their worldview. This greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the Party Committee, making it a powerful locomotive driving the unit forward.

Go Among the Masses, Correctly Understand Yourself, and Place Yourself in the Position of a Revolutionary Object

"The leadership must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." This teaching from our great leader Chairman Mao is the most heartfelt concern and the greatest encouragement for cadres.

The Party Committee of the 6819 Unit followed Chairman Mao's instructions and, together with the unit, went to communes, production teams, factories, and schools to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they tempered and transformed themselves.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was like a storm, swift and fierce. Everyone was undergoing an examination without a test. After the Party Committee members went among the masses, they encountered many new problems, which educated them greatly.

They held a Mao Zedong Thought study class in a commune and encountered the following incident. A female teacher, Huang Yurong, from a local primary school, bravely posted a big-character poster in April 1966, exposing "The Private Life of a Communist" as a poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought. She suffered cruel persecution from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and endured spiritual and physical torture for eight months. However, she remained steadfast and fought bravely, defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, ultimately winning the struggle. The Party Committee members thought: In terms of age, they are older than her; in terms of revolutionary tempering, they have more experience than her; in terms of receiving Chairman Mao's teachings, they have more than her. Why is their awareness of the line struggle lower than hers, why is there less Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, and why is their fearless revolutionary spirit not as strong as hers? This made them realize how much they needed to study Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from revolutionary youngsters, and transform their worldview!

Once, they went to a factory to learn from the masses and heard about the situation during the Cultural Revolution, seeing the evil results of Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the capitalist road and the restoration of capitalism in this factory. Some cadres, after victory, did not continue to transform themselves, put "self" first, acted like officials, and were hit by sugar-coated bullets. These facts made the Party Committee members think of Chairman Mao's teaching: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by armed enemies and are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of bullets coated with sugar, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets." They further realized that "self" is the root of all evil, and "revisionism" is the evil fruit of the expansion of "self."

These two incidents made them recall an incident in the unit. In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing stirred up a frenzy of military competitions. Under the impact of this frenzy, the Party Committee organized the unit to conduct two months of intensive military training. However, at the same time, the soldiers of the Sixth Company resisted this frenzy. They pointed out sharply: military competitions are a bourgeois military line, directly contrary to Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, and are opposed to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's advocacy of the Four Firsts. After Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued instructions on emphasizing politics, the Party Committee members, with their own problems, went to the Sixth Company and, together with the soldiers, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, seeking guidance from the soldiers. They realized that the soldiers loved Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line the most and executed it the most resolutely. They were not afraid of losing face and did not want to compete for medals, so when military competitions came, they could sense the wrong direction and resist it. However, due to their desire to show off and compete for medals, they could not see the problem after the frenzy of military competitions started and blindly followed.

Looking at the present and thinking about the past, everyone deeply felt that they must revolutionize themselves! They must engage in self-criticism! Only by honestly placing themselves in the position of a revolutionary object, revolutionizing the "self" in their minds, can they follow Chairman Mao closely, lead the unit well, and become a revolutionary force.

To enhance the Party Committee members' awareness of self-criticism and increase their hatred of "self," the Party Committee also conducted class education among the Party Committee members. They used Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as a weapon, visited poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside to learn about their sufferings in the old society, and investigated the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line in factories and schools, just like the soldiers in the company, recalling bitterness and making accusations. Through recalling and comparing, everyone realized that if leading cadres do not engage in self-criticism and anti-revisionism, allowing "self" to dominate their minds, they cannot seize power for the proletariat and cannot implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this way, everyone understood Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat more deeply, and their revolutionary consciousness was higher.

Go Among the Masses, Correctly Handle Criticisms from the Masses, and Let the Masses Help You Revolutionize

Leading cadres must revolutionize themselves and correctly handle criticisms from the masses. The Party Committee of this unit decided to mobilize the masses to help them revolutionize. They broadly listened to the criticisms and opinions of cadres and soldiers about the Party Committee. These criticisms hit the Party Committee members' sore spots and touched their souls. Originally, they thought the Party Committee's work was quite good, and the Committee members' ideological revolutionization was passable. Therefore, facing the sharp criticisms from the masses, some felt their faces burning, and some could not sit still.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will, in this process of criticism, correctly understand the world and change the world." They, with the desire to hear the masses' criticisms but also the fear of being criticized by the masses, repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on grasping class struggle in the ideological realm. They thought of many questions: Why, in the years of war, could they humbly listen to the masses' opinions to defeat the armed enemies and be willing to be the masses' little students, but today, to defeat the enemies in their minds, they cannot listen to the masses' criticisms? Why, in the past, did they feel happy when fighting the Kuomintang fiercely and smashing them to pieces, but now, when the masses help them dig out their selfishness, do they feel uncomfortable?

When these questions were directed at themselves, they realized that the problem was not elsewhere but in their lack of thorough revolutionary spirit towards the "self" in their minds. The masses discovered the "self" in leading cadres and criticized it, but some leading cadres were afraid of pain and ugliness and could not listen to the masses' criticisms. In this way, how could they revolutionize themselves well? Being afraid of the masses' criticisms is, in essence, being afraid of the revolution. To thoroughly revolutionize the "self," one must rely on the masses and let the masses help revolutionize. The Party Committee members decided to learn from the masses, taking the masses' criticisms and help as a driving force for their ideological revolutionization.

Former unit commander Wang Fangzhen specially went to a company where he had many criticisms and asked the soldiers to criticize and help him. Political Commissar Song Zipei specially invited those who liked to give opinions to give him feedback. Other Committee members also packed their bags and went to the companies to learn from the soldiers, asking the soldiers to criticize and supervise them. All Committee members had key connected companies in the unit and their own connected points in the locality. They stayed in the barracks with the soldiers, sharing "five together," and in the countryside, they shared "three together" with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They spent more than half a month learning from the advanced unit of studying Chairman Mao's works in their own unit. They fed and exercised horses with the soldiers, drove carts together, and studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together. During the unit's battle to reclaim land from the sea, the Party Committee members worked with the soldiers, enduring the scorching sun in summer, laboring in seawater below zero in winter, and listening to the soldiers' opinions in the workshops at night.

Going among the masses to listen to the masses' criticisms and asking the masses to help revolutionize is the best way to discover one's ailments and roots. Leading cadres going among the masses, being the masses' little students, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works like the masses can achieve immediate results in ideological transformation. Former unit commander Wang Renxiu used to carry the burden of being an old revolutionary, old Party member, and old cadre, with many selfish thoughts. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution came, he realized that his thoughts were lagging behind and needed revolution, but he still thought that transforming thoughts could be done "gradually." He carried his bag to the transport team and lived, ate, worked, and studied with the soldiers, asking the soldiers to criticize and help him. The soldiers used their own experiences of ideological transformation to help him, making him greatly shocked and realizing that he carried the "three olds" burden as capital for seeking fame and wealth. Now, he still thought that correcting this wrong thought could be done "gradually," but how could he follow Chairman Mao closely in this way! In this furnace, he tempered himself, making great progress in his thoughts.

The Party Committee, based on the Committee members' experiences of mobilizing the masses to help them revolutionize, summarized an experience of "one point, two aspects, and three fierce tactics" for ideological transformation. "One point" is to grasp the transformation of worldview as the key, "two aspects" is to combine self-awareness of revolution with mobilizing the masses to help revolutionize, and "three fierce tactics" is to, after studying Chairman Mao's works, engage in self-criticism fiercely, bravely, and attack fiercely like the soldiers.

Go Among the Masses, Eliminate Officialdom, and Forever Be the People's Servant

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: We must engage in self-criticism and anti-revisionism.

Chairman Mao also said: "We Communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution. Everyone must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not, even for a moment, be separated from the masses."

The Party Committee of the 6819 Unit believed that the "self" of leading cadres is prominently manifested in "officialdom." Eliminating officialdom should be the breakthrough point for leading cadres to transform their worldview. They firmly grasped the task of thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois idea of being an official and a lord, thoroughly establishing the idea of being a servant of the people, and establishing a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people.

When Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, the Party Committee, despite the heavy tasks in the unit, sent the unit to the countryside to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and temper themselves in the struggle. At that time, the struggle between the two lines was entering the decisive stage, and more than 300 mass organizations nearby came to the door, asking the unit for support. At this time, the Party Committee members had the thought of "fear" in their minds. They thought of leading the unit into the fierce class struggle but were afraid of making mistakes. They studied Chairman Mao's works with this question and realized that all kinds of fears ultimately came down to fearing the loss of officialdom, fearing that the class struggle's twelve-level typhoon would blow off the official's hat. "Officialdom" became an obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and an obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It must be criticized! Therefore, the Party Committee members, with their questions, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," went among the masses, learned from the cadres and soldiers of the companies, and eliminated officialdom.

Company Commander Wang Yongchang, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, went to the most difficult places; he put down his pride, willingly being the masses' little student, humbly accepting the masses' criticisms. The hard life and heavy work made him sick, but the masses wanted him to rest, and he did not go; they wanted him to rest, and he did not agree; during meetings, he could not stand up and participated lying down, always fighting with the masses. Medical orderly Yi Jiede, with his boundless love for Chairman Mao, used Sundays to go to a production brigade more than 20 li away to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, uninterrupted for more than four months, rain or shine. The Party Committee members compared themselves with Wang Yongchang and Yi Jiede and felt that their revolutionary spirit was inferior because of the "officialdom" in them. The Party Committee members deeply realized that if leading cadres do not eliminate the obstacle of "officialdom," they will inevitably be separated from the masses and deviate from the track of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and at any time, they may go astray.

Mass struggle is the best battlefield for criticizing "officialdom." The Party Committee sent the Party Committee members to the Hou Tian Village near the station to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In Hou Tian Village, there was a production team leader, Shen Changyou, who regarded being a cadre as fulfilling his duty to the people, being the masses' old yellow ox. He thought every day of serving the people and worked diligently for the masses all year round, often practicing democracy, and regarded the masses' criticisms as a whip for himself. This team leader's deeds greatly inspired the Party Committee members. For thousands of years, officials were lords who rode on the people's heads and enjoyed themselves. Only our Communist "officials" are diligent and hardworking old yellow oxes serving the people. Some Party Committee members used to think that their relationship with the masses was "I am big, you are small; I am old, you are new; I say, you listen." Now, it has changed. They said, you are the master, I am the servant; you are the teacher, I am the student.

Now, the leading cadres of this unit maintain close and frequent contact with the masses. They often live among the masses, and the masses often go to their homes. The unit commander's dormitory has become a reception station for the masses. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to engage in self-criticism and anti-revisionism, they immediately set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes and, together with the masses, engaged in self-criticism and anti-revisionism. They openly revealed any shortcomings or mistakes in their thoughts and work to the masses. They held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the unit with soldiers participating. In the countryside, they studied with grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. They humbly listened to the masses' criticisms, fiercely engaged in self-criticism, and greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the Party Committee. The ideological revolutionization of the Party Committee, in turn, greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the unit.

The Party Committee of the 6819 Unit summarized their experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, transforming their worldview, going among the masses, and revolutionizing themselves into one sentence: follow, learn from below, and be an apprentice. "Follow" is to closely follow Chairman Mao and his latest instructions. "Learn from below" is to humbly learn from the masses. "Be an apprentice" is to be the masses' little student and the people's servant. This experience has become the conscious action of the Party Committee members, and they are striding forward on the road of ideological revolutionization!

    到群众中去  革自己的命
    人民解放军六八一九部队党委活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观的经验
    人民解放军广州部队六八一九部队党委，在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行毛主席一系列最新指示，到群众中去，“斗私，批修”，改造世界观，大大促进了党委的思想革命化，使这个党委成为带动部队前进的一个强有力的火车头。
      到群众中去，正确认识自己，把自己摆在革命对象的位置上
    “你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，是对领导干部最亲切的关怀，最巨大的鼓舞。
    六八一九部队党委遵照毛主席的教导，和部队一起到公社、生产队、工厂、学校，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的革命路线，在无产阶级文化大革命中，锻炼自己，改造自己。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，每个人都在经受一场不考试的考试。这个部队党委的同志们到群众中去以后，碰到了许多新的问题，使他们受到很大的教育。
    他们到一个公社办毛泽东思想学习班，遇到了这样一件事。一个民办小学的女教师黄育英，由于活学活用毛主席著作，在一九六六年四月份，就勇敢地贴出大字报，揭露黑《修养》是反毛泽东思想的大毒草。她遭到党内一小撮走资派的残酷迫害，在长达八个月的时间里，经受了精神和肉体上的种种折磨。但是，她始终坚贞不屈，英勇地进行斗争，坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，终于取得了斗争的胜利。党委委员们想：论年纪，自己比她大；论革命锻炼的时间，自己比她长；论受毛主席的教导，自己比她多，为什么路线斗争的觉悟比她低，头脑里的毛泽东思想比她少，大无畏的革命精神没有她强呢？这使他们感到自己是多么需要努力学习毛泽东思想，虚心地向革命小将学习，改造自己的世界观啊！
    有一次，他们到一个工厂去向群众学习，听了介绍文化大革命的情况，看到中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义路线，搞资本主义复辟，在这个厂所产生的恶果。有的干部在胜利之后，不继续改造自己，“私”字当头，当官做老爷，被糖衣炮弹打中了。这些事实，使党委委员们想到毛主席的教导：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”他们进一步看到“私”字是万恶之源，“修”字是“私”字膨胀的恶果。
    由这两件事，又使他们联想到部队里的一件事。那是在一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起了一阵大比武的妖风。在这股妖风的冲击下，党委曾经组织部队搞了两个月的军事训练大突击。可是，在同一时间里，六连的战士却顶住了大比武这股妖风。他们一针见血地指出：大比武是资产阶级军事路线，直接违背了毛主席的一贯教导，是和林彪副主席提倡的四个第一唱对台戏的。林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示下达后，党委委员们带着自己的问题来到六连，和战士一起活学活用毛主席著作，向战士请教。他们认识到，战士对毛主席和毛主席的革命路线爱得最深，执行得最坚决，他们不怕丢面子，不想争锦标，所以大比武一来，就能察觉到风向不对，加以抵制。而自己由于存在着出风头、争锦标的思想，大比武的妖风刮起来以后，就看不出问题，盲目地跟着跑。
    看现在，想过去，大家深深感到，非革自己的命不可！非斗私不可！只有老老实实地把自己摆在革命对象的位置上，革头脑里“私”字的命，才能紧跟毛主席，才能带好部队，才能成为革命的动力。
    为了提高党委成员斗私的自觉性，增强对“私”字的仇恨，党委还在党委成员中进行了阶级教育。他们以毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论为武器，到农村访问贫下中农在旧社会受的苦，到工厂、学校调查资产阶级反动路线的罪行，象连队战士那样进行了忆苦和控诉。通过回忆对比，使大家认识到，领导干部如果不“斗私，批修”，让“私”字在头脑里占统治地位，就不可能为无产阶级掌权，就不可能贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。这样，大家对毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论，就理解更深了，革命的自觉性就更高了。
      到群众中去，正确对待群众的
    批评，让群众帮助自己革命
    领导干部要革自己的命，必须正确对待群众的批评。这个部队的党委下定决心，发动群众来帮助自己革命。他们广泛地听取了干部战士对党委的批评意见。这些批评意见打到了党委委员们的疼处，触及了党委委员们的灵魂。原来他们自己以为党委的工作做得不错了，委员们的思想革命化也过得去，因此，面对群众提出的尖锐批评，有的人脸发烧了，有的坐不住了。
    毛主席教导我们：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。”他们带着想听到群众的批评，又怕群众批评这个问题，反复学习了“老三篇”和毛主席关于要抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争的教导，想到了很多问题：为什么在战争年代为了消灭拿枪的敌人能够虚心听取群众意见，甘当群众的小学生，而今天为了消灭自己头脑里的敌人，却听不进群众的批评？为什么过去打国民党越打得狠、砸得烂，心里越痛快，而现在群众帮助自己挖私心，就感到不舒服了呢？
    这些问号往自己身上一打，原来问题不在别的地方，还是在对头脑里的“私”字缺乏彻底革命的精神。群众发现领导干部的“私”字就要批评，而有的领导干部却怕疼怕丑，听不进群众的批评，这样，怎么能革好自己的命呢？怕群众的批评，实质上就是怕革命。要彻底革“私”字的命，必须依靠群众，让群众帮助自己来革。党委委员们下定决心拜群众为师，把群众的批评帮助作为促进自己思想革命化的动力。
    原部队长王方珍专门到对他意见多的连队请战士批评帮助自己。政委宋子佩专门请那些爱提意见的干部、战士给自己提意见。其他委员也都纷纷打起背包到连队向战士学习，请战士对自己进行批评监督。全体委员在部队里都有重点的联系连队，在地方都有自己的联系点。下连住在班里和战士“五同”，下农村和贫下中农“三同”。他们曾经用半个多月的时间，到本部队学习毛主席著作先进单位运输队去学习。他们和战士一起喂马、遛马，一起赶车，一起活学活用“老三篇”。在部队进行围海垦田的战斗中，党委委员们和战士一起，夏天顶着烈日，冒着酷暑，在海滩上挑泥，冬天顶着海风在零下几度的海水里劳动，夜晚在工棚里听取战士们的意见。
    到群众中去，听取群众的批评，请群众帮助自己革命，最能发现自己的病情和病根。领导干部到群众中去，当群众的小学生，象群众那样活学活用毛主席著作，思想改造就可以立竿见影。部队长王仁修过去背着老革命、老党员、老干部的包袱，私心杂念比较多，无产阶级文化大革命来了，他认识到自己的思想跟不上，需要革命，但还是认为改造思想可以“慢慢来”。他背着背包到运输队和战士同吃同住同劳动同学习，请战士对他进行批评帮助。战士用自己的思想改造经验帮助他，使他受到极大的震动，认识到自己所以背着“三老”的包袱，是把它作为追求名利地位的资本。现在，自己还认为破这个错误思想可以“慢慢来”，这样对毛主席怎么能步步紧跟呢！他在运输队这个熔炉里，锻炼自己，思想上有很大的进步。
    党委根据委员们发动群众帮助自己革命的体会，总结了一条思想改造要“一点两面”“三猛战术”的经验。一点，就是要抓住改造世界观这个重点，两面，就是把自觉革命和发动群众帮助自己革命结合起来。“三猛战术”，就是学了毛主席著作以后，斗私心要象战士们那样猛亮、猛斗、猛攻。
      到群众中去，打掉官气，永远
    当人民的勤务员
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：要斗私，批修。
    毛主席又说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”
    六八一九部队党委认为，领导干部的私，突出地表现在“官”字上，打掉官气，应该成为领导干部改造世界观的突破口。他们紧紧抓住大破资产阶级当官作老爷的思想，大立当人民勤务员的思想，树立全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。
    毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，党委在部队担负繁重任务的情况下，把部队撒到农村中去，宣传毛泽东思想，在斗争中经受锻炼。当时两条路线斗争正进入决战阶段，驻地附近三百多个群众组织一起找上门，要部队支持。这时，党委委员思想上产生了“怕”字，他们想带领部队投入激烈的阶级斗争中去，又怕投进去犯错误。他们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，认识到，这怕那怕，说到头来还是怕丢官，怕阶级斗争的十二级台风吹掉乌纱帽。“官”字，成了执行毛主席革命路线的障碍，成了执行毛主席一系列最新指示的障碍，非破不可！于是，党委成员带着问题学习“老三篇”，到群众中去，向连队的干部战士学习，克服官气。
    连长王永昌为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，那里最艰苦，就到那里去；他放下架子，甘当群众的小学生，虚心接受群众的批评。艰苦的生活，繁重的工作，使他病倒了，群众要他养病他不去，让他休息他又不肯，开会的时候他起不来就躺着参加，始终和群众战斗在一起。卫生员易皆得怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，利用星期天到二十多里以外的一个生产大队去宣传毛泽东思想，四个多月风雨无阻，从不间断。党委委员们把自己同王永昌和易皆得作了对比，觉得自己的革命精神所以比他们差，就是“官”字在作怪。党委委员们深深认识到，领导干部如果不扫除“官”字这个障碍，就必然会脱离群众，脱离毛主席的革命路线的轨道，就随时可能走到邪路上去。
    群众斗争，是破“官”字最好的战场。党委把党委成员拉到驻地附近的厚田大队，办毛泽东思想学习班。厚田大队有个生产队长申长友，把当干部看成是为人民尽义务，当群众的老黄牛，他天天想的是为人民服务，一年到头勤勤恳恳为群众办事，他经常发扬民主，把群众的批评看成是对自己的鞭策。这个生产队长的事迹给党委委员们很大的启发。几千年来的官都是骑在人民头上作威作福的老爷，唯独我们共产党的“官”才是勤勤恳恳为人民服务的老黄牛。有的党委委员，过去认为自己和群众的关系是“我大你小，我老你新，我说你听”，现在变了，他们说，你是主人，我是勤务员，你是老师，我是小学生。
    现在，这个部队的领导干部和群众保持着经常的密切联系，他们经常生活在群众中，群众也经常到他们家里去。部队长的宿舍成了群众接待站。毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召后，他们立即办起了毛泽东思想学习班，和群众一起斗私批修。自己思想上工作上有什么缺点错误，都能够毫不吞吞吐吐地在群众面前亮出来。他们在部队办毛泽东思想学习班，有战士参加。到农村办学习班，就和基层干部、贫下中农一起学习。他们虚心听取群众的批评，狠斗“私”字，大大促进了党委的思想革命化。党委的思想革命化，又大大地带动了部队的思想革命化。
    六八一九部队党委把他们活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，到群众中去，革自己的命的经验，概括为一句话，就是：跟上、学下、当徒弟。“跟上”，就是紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的最新指示。“学下”，就是老老实实向群众学习。“当徒弟”，就是当群众的小学生，当人民的勤务员。这条经验已经成为党委委员们自觉的行动，他们正在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进！
