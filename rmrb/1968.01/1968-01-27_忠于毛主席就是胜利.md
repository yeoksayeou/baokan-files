January 26, 1968, is a day I will never forget. It was the happiest day of my life, the day I realized my long-cherished wish to see the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao! My heart was pounding, and tears of joy streamed down my face. I shouted over and over again, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I am like a young seedling, growing vigorously under the radiance of your great thoughts. It is you, Chairman, who taught me the principles of revolution, to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, to serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your great thoughts that gave me the enormous strength to overcome death and pain, and it is you who gave me a second life.

On the morning of September 25, 1966, while I was working, a rock weighing about 5,000 to 6,000 pounds and over two meters long suddenly fell from a height of five to six meters. One end of the rock hit the ground and then toppled over, crushing my body from the shoulders down. Instantly, I felt numb all over and had difficulty breathing. At that moment, your majestic and great voice, "Resolutely fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," echoed in my heart. The images of heroes like Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie appeared before me, giving me boundless strength. When my comrades rushed to rescue me, I firmly replied, "With Mao Zedong Thought, I can endure it!" I persevered for over forty minutes.

My comrades rushed me to the hospital. Due to the severity of my injuries, surgery was needed immediately. However, my heartbeat was weak, and my blood pressure was low. If they used anesthesia, there was a risk my heart would stop; if they didn't, I might not be able to bear the pain. When I saw the doctors hesitating, I remembered your great teachings: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will crush all enemies and never be subdued by them." I immediately declared that I could endure any pain and asked the doctors to proceed with the surgery without hesitation. The surgery began, and when the pain became unbearable, I sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm," and recited your quotations. Throughout the surgery, I did not cry out in pain or shed a single tear.

I deeply understand: Loyalty to you, loyalty to your brilliant thoughts, and loyalty to your proletarian revolutionary line is victory. I swear to you, Chairman, that I will make studying and applying your brilliant works my first priority in the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the storms of class struggle. I will unconditionally carry out your latest instructions as the highest duty of a revolutionary soldier. I am determined to forever be your good soldier.

    忠于毛主席就是胜利
    第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表　曲俊臣
    一九六八年一月二十六日，是我一辈子也忘不了的最最幸福的日子。这一天，实现了我日思夜想的最美好的愿望，见到了世界革命人民心中最红的红太阳毛主席！我的心在激烈跳动，幸福的热泪夺眶而出。我一遍又一遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我象一株春苗，在您伟大思想的光辉沐浴下茁壮地成长。是您老人家教育我懂得了革命的道理，要破私立公，完全彻底地为人民服务。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的伟大思想给了我战胜死亡和伤痛的巨大力量，是您给了我第二次生命。
    一九六六年九月二十五日凌晨，正在施工的时候，一块约五、六千斤重二米多长的岩石，突然从五、六米高的地方落了下来，石头的一端刚着地，就朝我歪倒下来，把我肩膀以下的身子全部压住。顿时，浑身麻木，呼吸困难。就在这时候，您老人家庄严而伟大的声音“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”从心底响起，董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰等英雄形象浮现在眼前，使我增添了无限的力量。当同志们抢救我的时候，我坚定地回答：“有毛泽东思想在，我顶得住！”这样，我一直坚持了四十多分钟。
    同志们把我抢救出来，立即送进医院。因伤势严重，需要马上施行手术。可是我心脏跳动微弱，血压过低，施用麻醉吧，有使心脏停止跳动的可能；不用麻醉吧，又怕我痛得忍受不了。当我看出医生犹豫不决，左右为难的时候，就想起了您的伟大教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”我立即表示什么痛苦也能忍受，要求医生大胆地动手术。手术开始了，我实在痛得厉害的时候，就唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，背诵您的语录。就这样，整个手术过程，我没有喊过一声痛，没有落过一滴泪。
    我深深懂得：忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，就是胜利。我向您老人家宣誓：我一定在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把活学活用您的光辉著作，当作生命的第一需要；把不折不扣地执行您的最新指示，当作革命战士最崇高的职责。我决心永远做您的好战士。
