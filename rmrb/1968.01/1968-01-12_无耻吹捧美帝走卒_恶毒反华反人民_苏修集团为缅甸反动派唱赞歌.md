	The Soviet revisionist clique recently used the pretext of "celebrating" Myanmar's "Independence Day" (January 4) to once again shamelessly beautify the Ne Win reactionary regime in Myanmar and seize the opportunity to attack China.

	On January 9, the Soviet revisionist leadership sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek Ne Win of Myanmar, "welcoming" the "friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation" that had been established between them and expressing their "confidence" that such relations would "continue to develop successfully." On January 3, at a "celebration banquet" held in Moscow, the representative of the Soviet revisionist clique, in his speech, disgustingly praised Ne Win, who had surrendered to U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique and sold out national interests, as a "famous fighter against imperialism." On January 3 and 4, the Soviet revisionist clique also mobilized its main propaganda machines, such as *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, and TASS, to publish articles praising the fascist regime of Ne Win for brutally oppressing and exploiting workers, peasants, and other laboring masses under the guise of false socialism, and fabricating the so-called "program" of the Ne Win clique's "Myanmar's Road to Socialism" as a "program" that "opened a non-capitalist development path for the country."

	The Soviet revisionist clique also enthusiastically cheered for the Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign, viciously attacking the Chinese people's resolute condemnation of the Ne Win clique's crimes of acting as running dogs for U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique and stirring up a nationwide anti-China and anti-Chinese tide as "vile slander" against the "revolutionary government of Myanmar." The Soviet revisionist leadership's eagerness to cheer for the Ne Win reactionary regime, on the one hand, and its vicious attacks on the Chinese people, on the other, once again exposed its traitorous nature.

    无耻吹捧美帝走卒　恶毒反华反人民
    苏修集团为缅甸反动派唱赞歌
    新华社九日讯　苏修领导集团最近打着“庆祝”缅甸“独立日”（一月四日）的幌子，再一次无耻地美化缅甸奈温反动政权，并乘机攻击中国。
    苏修头目柯西金和波德戈尔内向缅甸的蒋介石奈温发出一封贺电，“欢迎”他们之间“已经建立的友好关系和全面合作”，并且“深信”这种关系将“继续成功地发展”。一月三日，在莫斯科举行的一次“庆祝晚会”上，苏修集团的代表在讲话中把投靠美英帝国主义和苏修集团，出卖民族利益的奈温，肉麻地吹捧为“反帝斗争的著名活动家”。一月三日和四日两天，苏修集团还开动《真理报》、《消息报》和塔斯社等主要宣传机器，发表文章，为奈温法西斯政权残酷地压迫和剥削工人、农民和其他劳动群众的假社会主义大唱赞歌，胡诌奈温集团的所谓
  “缅甸通向社会主义之路”的“纲领”，是一个“给国家开辟了非资本主义发展道路”的“纲领”。
    苏修集团还为奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华呐喊助威，恶毒地攻击中国人民坚决谴责奈温集团充当美帝和苏修的走卒，掀起全国规模的反华排华逆流的种种罪行，是什么“对缅甸革命政府”的“卑鄙的诽谤”等。苏修领导集团如此起劲地向奈温反动政权叫好，另一方面恶毒地攻击中国人民，这再一次暴露了它的叛徒面目。
