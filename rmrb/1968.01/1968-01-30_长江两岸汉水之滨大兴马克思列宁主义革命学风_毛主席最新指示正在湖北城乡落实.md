According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 28th — Over 10,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established in urban and rural areas across Hubei Province, with over a million participants. These classes are vigorously promoting the revolutionary study style of Marxism-Leninism as advocated by Chairman Mao. After studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, participants swiftly translate their learning into action, effectively promoting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the province. This has significantly accelerated the province's progress in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Along the Yangtze River, along the Han River, in the three towns of Wuhan, and in the villages of western Hubei, one batch after another of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established. Everywhere, the battlefields of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism are in full swing. The broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, analyzing the situation, sharing experiences, exposing thoughts, criticizing selfishness, and marching forward with great strides. The revolutionary study style of Marxism-Leninism, personally advocated by Chairman Mao, is flourishing. The heroic three towns of Wuhan have achieved revolutionary great unity by industry, system, and class, and have established the Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Various prefectures, cities, and counties are quickly catching up. So far, five prefectures and over 90% of the counties in the province have achieved revolutionary great unity. Chairman Mao's policy on cadres has deeply resonated with the people. With the help of the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres have quickly emerged in various regions and on various fronts, striving to achieve new merits in the revolutionary struggle. The revolutionary criticism and repudiation in urban and rural areas across the province is continuing to deepen and is increasingly integrated with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit. The educational revolution in primary and secondary schools across the province is universally developing and gradually deepening. The production enthusiasm of the working people and peasants is unprecedentedly high, and they are actively contributing to the upcoming production leap.

The millions of participants in Mao Zedong Thought study classes across Hubei Province are taking "The Little Red Book" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their central content and fundamental task, focusing on the key aspect of implementation, and ensuring that theory is linked with practice, that efforts are targeted, that learning is combined with application, and that results are immediate. Their specific practices are: firmly grasping the three fundamentals, attending the three courses, and solving the three problems in implementation. These are: firmly grasping the fundamental attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao, using methods such as recalling and comparing, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, to attend the class on class education, to raise class consciousness, and to solve the problem of whether to use or not to use; firmly grasping the fundamental purpose of studying Mao Zedong Thought, using methods such as widely discussing, widely speaking, and widely viewing, to attend the class on situation education, to raise the level of linking theory with practice, and to solve the problem of whether to use correctly or not; firmly grasping the fundamental task of the Cultural Revolution, using methods such as checking and summarizing, to attend the class on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and to solve the problem of whether to persist in using, to use long-term, and to use comprehensively.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Through widely discussing the unprecedented great situation of the Cultural Revolution, widely speaking about the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, widely discussing the great significance of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and widely speaking about the absolute necessity of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the various Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Hubei have a clearer understanding of the current great situation, a more definite learning task, more specific learning requirements, and a closer link with practice. The participants pointed out that by linking the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practice, one can understand, remember, apply, and apply well. The deeper the link with practice, the deeper the understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the more conscious the application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to solve various practical problems in the region, unit, and oneself. To better link with practice, to study with problems in mind, to actively learn and apply, to learn urgently and see immediate results, various places in Hubei have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes to solve various specific problems. There are study classes for achieving revolutionary great unity, for achieving the three-in-one combination, for educational revolution, for studying Chairman Mao's line on party building, and so on. The masses call the establishment of such study classes "concentrating forces to fight a battle of annihilation." These study classes, within a certain period, concentrate on studying and mastering one aspect of Chairman Mao's great teachings, criticizing and purging one aspect of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and their poison in the region and unit, and further implementing one of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving good results.

Many regions and grassroots units also use Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the main battlefield, adopting the method of focusing on key areas to drive general progress, mobilizing the masses, and using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, to revise and formulate the battle plans for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The practical experience of various places in Hubei shows that using the form of battle plans to more closely combine learning with application is an important guarantee for comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, for persistently learning and applying long-term, for learning and applying comprehensively, and for promoting the revolutionary study style.

    长江两岸汉水之滨大兴马克思列宁主义革命学风
    毛主席最新指示正在湖北城乡落实
    据新华社武汉二十八日电　湖北省城乡各地兴办的一万多个毛泽东思想学习班，上百万学员，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。他们学了毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，就雷厉风行地见之于行动，有力地促进了毛主席最新指示在全省全面落实，大大加快了紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的前进步伐。
    在长江两岸，在汉水之滨，在武汉三镇，在鄂西北山村，一批又一批毛泽东思想学习班兴办起来，到处是斗私批修的战场。广大工农群众、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，摆形势，谈体会，亮思想，斗私心，阔步前进。毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风蔚然成风。英雄的武汉三镇已经实现了按行业、按系统、按班级的革命大联合，成立了市革命委员会。各专区、市、县急起直追，到目前为止，全省五个专区和百分之九十以上的县已经实现了革命大联合。毛主席的干部政策深入人心，在广大无产阶级革命派的帮助下，各个地区、各条战线都有大批革命领导干部迅速站了出来，努力在革命斗争中立新功。全省城乡的革命大批判也在继续深入开展，并且同本单位的斗批改结合日益紧密。全省大中小学的教育革命普遍开展，逐步深入。工农群众生产积极性空前高涨，正在为迎接新的生产跃进作出积极贡献。
    湖北全省数以百万计的毛泽东思想学习班的学员以“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示为中心内容，以全面落实毛主席的最新指示为根本任务，抓住用字这个关键，切实做到理论联系实际，有的放矢，学用结合，立竿见影。他们的具体做法是：狠抓“三个根本”，上好“三门课程”，解决用字上的“三个问题”。这就是：狠抓对待伟大领袖毛主席的根本态度，运用回忆对比、忆苦思甜等方式，上好阶级教育课，以提高阶级觉悟，解决肯用不肯用的问题；狠抓学习毛泽东思想的根本目的，运用大摆、大讲、大看等方式，上好形势教育课，以提高理论联系实际的水平，解决会用不会用的问题；狠抓无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务，运用检查、总结等方式，上好落实毛主席最新指示课，以发扬不断革命精神，解决能不能坚持用、长期用、全面用的问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”湖北各地毛泽东思想学习班通过大摆无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，大摆紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的重大意义，大讲落实毛主席最新指示的绝对必要，对当前大好形势的认识更清楚，学习任务更明确，学习要求更具体，联系实际更紧密。学员们指出，结合实际学习毛主席的最新指示，学得懂，记得住，用得上，用得好。联系实际越深入，对毛主席最新指示的理解就越深刻，运用毛主席最新指示解决本地区、本单位和自己的各种实际问题就越自觉。为了更好地联系实际，做到带着问题学，活学活用，急用先学，立竿见影，湖北各地举办了解决各种专门问题的毛泽东思想学习班，有实现革命大联合的学习班、实现革命三结合的学习班、教育革命学习班、学习毛主席建党路线学习班，等等。群众把办这种学习班，叫做
  “集中力量打歼灭战”。这些学习班在一段时间内，集中学习和掌握毛主席一个方面的伟大教导，批判和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的反动谬论及其在本地区、本单位的流毒，进一步落实毛主席的一项最新指示，收到了好效果。
    许多地区和基层单位还以毛泽东思想学习班为主要阵地，采取重点带动一般的办法，发动群众，以毛主席最新指示为纲，修改和制订了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗规划。湖北各地的实践经验表明，用战斗规划的形式把学和用更紧密地结合起来，是全面落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持长期学、长期用，全面学、全面用，大兴革命学风的重要保证。
