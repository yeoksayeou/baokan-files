Syrian Prime Minister Calls on People to Take Up Arms to Defeat U.S. Imperialism

Syrian Prime Minister Zain, on January 13, in a speech at the opening ceremony of the Syrian People's Army, called on the Arab people to take up armed struggle to defeat U.S. imperialism and Zionism. Zain strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for manipulating Israel to launch aggressive wars.

Zain pointed out in his speech on anti-aggression warfare that the decisive force in war is the people, the people determined to defend their homeland. He said that the United States used the most modern weapons in Vietnam, but was repeatedly defeated, which fully proves this point. Zain finally emphasized that to win the war, it is not only the army that is needed, but also the active participation of all the people. He said, "We must fight, be prepared to make sacrifices and overcome difficulties until victory is achieved."

Pakistan Newspaper Condemns U.S. and Soviet Aid to India's Military Build-up

The Pakistan Times on January 14, in an editorial, condemned U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism for aiding the Indian reactionary government in its frenzied military build-up. The editorial stated: Every time India receives military or economic aid from the Soviet Union and the United States, its chauvinistic attitude becomes more entrenched.

The editorial pointed out that Indian expansionists are continuing to strengthen their war machine. India's military expenditure has reached one billion rupees annually. The editorial said: India's massive military plans are aimed at threatening Pakistan and other neighboring countries. Among the major powers, the Soviet Union is clearly aiding India in its military expansion.

U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Armament of Its Tool of Aggression, Israel

While U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, is striving to push through a United Nations Security Council resolution on the Middle East issue that forces Arab countries to fully surrender to the aggressors, U.S. imperialism is also stepping up the armament of its lackey, Israel, to enable Israel to launch further aggression against Arab countries.

Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol visited the United States and held tense secret talks with U.S. imperialist chief Johnson. Johnson will give "positive and sympathetic consideration and study" to Israel's requests for military aid and maintaining Israel's "military defensive capability." The United States is delivering forty-eight jet fighter planes to Israel.
