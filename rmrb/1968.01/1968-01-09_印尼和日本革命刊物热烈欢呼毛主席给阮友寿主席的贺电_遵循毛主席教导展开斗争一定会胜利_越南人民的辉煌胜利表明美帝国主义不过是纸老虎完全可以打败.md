Indonesian and Japanese revolutionary publications have warmly applauded Chairman Mao's telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They have expressed their belief that by following Chairman Mao's teachings, victory is certain. The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people have shown that American imperialism is merely a paper tiger and can be defeated.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on January 8, the Indonesian publication "Voice of Indonesian Youth" recently published an editorial titled "The Heroic People of South Vietnam Will Surely Win." The editorial pointed out that the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, sent a telegram to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This telegram is a great joy for the people of South Vietnam. This telegram will undoubtedly inspire the struggle of the Vietnamese people and also inspire the struggles of all oppressed peoples around the world to carry out Chairman Mao's teachings: "No difficulty can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory."

The editorial pointed out that the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam over the past seven years have once again proven the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's statements that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The editorial pointed out that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Vietnamese and Indonesian peoples and the common enemy of all revolutionary peoples around the world. As Chairman Mao has taught: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." Now, American imperialism is being defeated by the heroic Vietnamese people, falling into a predicament, and has nowhere to go.

The editorial pointed out that the Indonesian people, from their own struggle experience, deeply understand that the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership are dangerous traitors. Although they have been increasingly exposed, their deceptive influence has not been eliminated. They continue to use the banner of "anti-imperialism" and "assisting the Vietnamese struggle." The people of the world must expose this fraud.

The editorial expressed its firm belief that the people of South Vietnam, relying on their own strength and firmly holding their guns, will surely be able to thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its running dogs. The heroic Vietnamese people will surely win!

According to a report from the New China News Agency on January 6, the Japanese publication "Long Weekly News" published an article on December 24 of last year, warmly applauding the telegram sent by the great leader Chairman Mao to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The article expressed the sincere support and encouragement of the 700 million Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. It also expressed the enthusiastic support, applause, and solidarity of the revolutionary people of the world for the brilliant armed struggle against American aggression by the heroic people of South Vietnam.

The article said that as Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in the telegram, the people of South Vietnam "under extremely difficult conditions, relying on their own strength, have beaten the most ferocious American imperialism into a corner, making it look ridiculous." The heroic people of Vietnam have completely proven through their seven-year people's revolutionary war: "No matter how big or small a country is, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." They have shown through their personal experience to the revolutionary people of the world: "No difficulty can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory." As long as they rely on the people, use revolutionary war to resist counter-revolutionary war, wage a people's war, and persist in a protracted war, then the oppressed peoples and nations will surely achieve victory.

The article pointed out that the glorious victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and the decisive victories achieved by the great leader Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution vividly show that this is the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. These victories have greatly boosted the courage of the revolutionary people of the world.

The article condemned the Soviet revisionist clique for colluding with American imperialism on the Vietnamese issue to play the "peace talks" trick. The article pointed out that this once again exposed the Soviet revisionist clique as the closest accomplice of American imperialism and the most shameful traitor to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

The article expressed its belief that as long as the revolutionary people of the world closely unite with the heroic Vietnamese people, firmly resolve to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and fight to the end, then, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "any military adventurism and political deception by American imperialism are doomed to failure."

    印尼和日本革命刊物热烈欢呼毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电
    遵循毛主席教导展开斗争一定会胜利
    越南人民的辉煌胜利表明美帝国主义不过是纸老虎完全可以打败
    据新华社八日讯　《印尼青年之声》最近在一篇题为《英雄的越南南方人民必胜》的社论中指出，全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年之际，给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿发了贺电，这是越南南方人民的极大幸福。这个贺电必将鼓舞越南人民的斗争，同时也鼓舞全世界被压迫人民的斗争，鼓舞他们去贯彻执行毛主席的教导：“任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。”
    社论指出，在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下的越南南方人民七年来所取得的伟大胜利，再次证明了毛泽东主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”和帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。
    社论指出，美帝国主义是越南人民和印尼人民的死敌，是全世界革命人民的共同敌人。正如毛主席所教导的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”现在，美帝国主义正在被英雄的越南人民打败，陷入困境，走投无路。
    社论指出，印尼人民从自己的斗争经验中深深地了解到，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者是危险的叛徒。尽管它已日益暴露了，但是它的欺骗作用还没有消除。它还继续打着“反帝”和“援助越南斗争”的招牌。全世界人民必须揭穿这个骗局。
    社论表示深信，越南南方人民依靠自己的力量，紧握手中枪，一定能够彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗。英雄的越南人民必胜！
    新华社六日讯　日本《长周新闻》去年十二月二十四日发表文章，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿的贺电，表达了七亿中国人民对越南人民抗美救国斗争的诚心支持和鼓励，同时也表达了全世界革命人民对英雄的越南南方人民的辉煌的反美武装斗争的热情支持、欢呼和团结的心情。
    文章说，正如毛泽东主席在贺电中所指出的，越南南方人民“在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪”。英雄的越南人民七年来的人民革命战争的胜利完全证明：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”他们用自己的亲身经历，向全世界的革命人民说明：“任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。”只要依靠人民，用革命战争反对反革命战争，开展人民战争，坚持持久战，那么被压迫人民和被压迫民族就一定会取得胜利。
    文章指出，英勇的越南人民的抗美救国战争的光辉胜利和伟大领袖毛主席所领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的决定性胜利，生动地表明当代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。这些胜利极大地鼓舞了世界革命人民的勇气。
    文章谴责苏联修正主义集团同美帝勾结在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”骗局。文章指出，这又一次暴露了苏联修正主义集团是美帝国主义最亲密的帮凶，是全世界人民革命事业的最可耻的叛徒。
    文章表示相信，只要世界革命人民同英雄的越南人民紧密团结，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，斗争到底，那末，正如毛主席所指出的，“美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”
