On the afternoon of November 16 last year, the weather was clear and pleasant. The rice fields in the suburbs of Haiphong City, in T Commune of Xian Lang County, presented a golden yellow hue. Members of the agricultural cooperative, filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest, were busily engaged in the urgent task of harvesting and threshing.

Suddenly, several loud explosions echoed through the sky. It turned out that an American bandit plane had been hit by intense anti-aircraft fire and blown to smithereens in mid-air. At the same time, a small white dot appeared in the sky, and the farmers immediately realized that this was an American spy parachuting to escape.

"Capture the American spy alive, capture the American spy alive!" The fields resonated with a thunderous roar.

Community member Huang Wenjin grabbed a pointed bamboo pole used for carrying rice bundles and swiftly rushed to capture the American spy. Sixty-five-year-old elder Du Wenlu, wielding a sickle, followed closely behind. Behind them were fourteen-year-old student Nguyen Van Nhan and the militia members. Filled with hatred and fury, they sped towards the direction where the American spy had fallen.

At that moment, a batch of enemy planes was bombing and strafing not far from them, attempting to prevent the community members from capturing the American spy alive. However, the militia and anti-aircraft units intensified their coordinated actions, firing dense and fierce artillery, forcing the enemy planes to avoid diving and low flying, thus protecting the people of T Commune in their battle to capture the American spy.

Just as the American spy landed in the rice field, he had not even caught his breath when the production team leader Tao Wenru, sixty-year-old community member Du Wenshou, and male and female militia members also arrived. The American spy was so frightened that he trembled all over, unable to stand up, and immediately surrendered by raising his hands.

The intense battle came to an end. T Commune in Xian Lang County was filled with the joy of victory. On the threshing ground of the agricultural cooperative, the community members threshed the grain in rhythm while joyfully and excitedly exclaimed, "Our agricultural cooperative not only achieved a good harvest of late rice but also captured an American spy alive. This is truly a double harvest!"

    生产战斗双丰收
    ——记海防市郊农民活捉美国飞贼
    去年十一月十六日下午，天气晴和，海防市郊先朗县Ｔ乡的稻田呈现一片金黄色，农业合作社社员满怀丰收的喜悦心情，正在紧张地进行抢收抢打。
    这时，忽然空中传来几声巨响，原来，一架美国强盗飞机被地面猛烈的高射炮火打中了，在空中炸得粉身碎骨。与此同时，空际出现了一个小白点，农民们立刻机警地意识到，这是美国贼正在跳伞逃命。
    “活捉美国飞贼，活捉美国飞贼！”田野上响起了一片震天动地的喊声。
    社员黄文进顺手拿起挑稻垛用的尖头扁担，立即奋勇地跑去捉美国飞贼，六十五岁的老大爷杜文抽也执着镰刀跟着上去。在他们的后面还有十四岁的学生阮文认和民兵们，人们满怀着仇恨的怒火朝着美国飞贼坠落的方向飞速奔去。
    这时候，一批敌机正在离他们不远的地方轰炸扫射，妄图阻止社员们生擒这个美国飞贼。但是，民兵与防空部队加紧协同作战，发出密集猛烈的炮火，迫使敌机不敢俯冲低飞，掩护着Ｔ乡人民抓美国飞贼的战斗。
    当美国飞贼刚刚落在稻田上，还来不及喘一口气，生产队长陶文努、六十岁的老社员杜文瘦和男女民兵们也都赶上来了。美国飞贼吓得全身发抖，站也站不起来就举手投降。
    一场激烈的战斗结束了。先朗县Ｔ乡充满着一片战斗胜利的欢乐气氛，在农业合作社的晒谷场上，社员们一边有节奏地打谷，一边喜气洋洋、兴高采烈地说：“我们农业社不仅晚稻取得好收成，而且活捉了美国飞贼，可算是双丰收了。”
