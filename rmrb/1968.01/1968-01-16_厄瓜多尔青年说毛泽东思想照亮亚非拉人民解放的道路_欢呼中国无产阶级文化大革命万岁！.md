A young man from Ecuador who had visited China expressed his enthusiastic praise for "Mao Zedong Thought as the contemporary Marxism-Leninism." He said, "The Chinese people have achieved astonishing results in just over a decade of socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is the result of the Chinese people taking Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle for all actions." He firmly believes that the revolutionary peoples of the world will all "take contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—as their guide."

He said, through his visits and observations in China, especially through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, he realized that the people of Latin America must follow the path of people's war as indicated by Chairman Mao. The path of the Chinese revolution is also the path of the Latin American people's revolution. He expressed his heartfelt wish that "Chairman Mao lives ten thousand years!" He firmly believes that the Chinese people will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that China will never change color and will always be a strong pillar for the revolutions of the peoples of all countries, and a great rear base for the world revolution.

A female university student from Ecuador enthusiastically said, "Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of national liberation for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." In a letter she wrote to a women's mass organization in China, she also expressed her "warm and revolutionary greetings to the women of China" during this historical stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and wished the Chinese people greater achievements in the Cultural Revolution based on their current successes.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are having an increasingly significant impact among the revolutionary youth of Ecuador. During the 23rd National Congress of the Ecuadorian University Students' Union, many students attending the conference shouted in the venue: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

    厄瓜多尔青年说毛泽东思想照亮亚非拉人民解放的道路
    欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    据新华社讯　瓜亚基尔消息：一位曾经访问过中国的厄瓜多尔青年热情赞扬“毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义”。他说，中国人民在短短十多年的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了惊人的成就，这是“中国人民以毛泽东思想作为一切行动指南的结果”。他表示坚信世界革命人民都将“以当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想作为指南”。
    他说，通过在中国的参观、访问，特别是学习了毛主席的光辉著作，他认识到：拉丁美洲人民必须走毛主席所指出的人民战争的道路，中国革命的道路也就是拉丁美洲人民革命的道路。他表示衷心祝愿“毛主席万寿无疆！”坚信中国人民将把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使中国永不变色，使中国一直成为世界各国人民革命的坚强支柱，成为世界革命的大后方。
    厄瓜多尔一位女大学生热情地说，毛泽东思想照亮了亚非拉各国人民的民族解放道路。她在一封写给中国的一个妇女群众组织的信里还表示“在无产阶级文化大革命这个历史阶段中，向中国妇女致亲切的、革命的敬礼”，并祝愿中国人民在文化大革命中“在现有成绩的基础上获得更大的成绩”。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想和史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在厄瓜多尔革命青年中正在产生越来越大的影响。厄瓜多尔大学生联合会举行第二十三次全国代表大会时，许多参加会议的学生在会场上高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
