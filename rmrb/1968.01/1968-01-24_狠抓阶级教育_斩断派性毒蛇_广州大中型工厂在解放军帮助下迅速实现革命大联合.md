The People's Liberation Army propaganda teams stationed in various factories in Guangzhou have enthusiastically assisted revolutionary mass organizations in jointly holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, established the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, emphasized class education, and helped various factions overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and achieve revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination.

Currently, 80% of the large and medium-sized factories in Guangzhou have united. When the PLA propaganda teams helped various revolutionary mass organizations jointly hold study classes, although people from different factions sat together, when the issue of factionalism was raised, there were either "cold spots" or "arguments." How to solve these problems? The propaganda team members, after serious analysis, believed that to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, to overcome factionalism, and to promote revolutionary great unity, it is necessary to establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao. The team members guided the students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "both sides should speak less about the shortcomings and errors of the other side, let the other side speak for themselves, and each side should do more self-criticism, seek great unity, and tolerate small differences," raising everyone's awareness of self-criticism.

To help the workers of various factions in each factory overcome factionalism and unite to fight the enemy together, the team members, in each Mao Zedong Thought study class, universally adopted the method of reminiscence and comparison to carry out class education. Workers from various mass organizations together recalled the suffering of being exploited and oppressed by capitalists in the old society, leading to family separations, ruined homes, and ruined lives. They denounced the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party who, during the Cultural Revolution, labeled revolutionary workers as "counter-revolutionaries" and "monsters and demons," inciting people to fight against people. This helped the workers clarify who the enemy is, who the friend is, what the bitter root is, and what the sweet source is, deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and recognizing the great significance of achieving revolutionary great unity. Many workers said: "No matter how much we hate, we should hate the handful of capitalist roaders within the party; no matter how good it is, it is because Chairman Mao leads well." "The working class is like bitter gourds on the same vine. We have common class interests, common revolutionary goals, and common class enemies, but now we are creating factionalism and fighting 'internal wars,' which can only make friends suffer and enemies rejoice." Through reminiscence and comparison, many workers in various factories have increased their class consciousness and improved their relationships. In one factory, there was a pair of "old rivals" who hadn't spoken to each other for four years. During the Cultural Revolution, they joined opposing factions, and their contradictions became more severe. In class education, they found the root cause of their long-term opposition. In the past, the lack of unity was due to the poisoning of the capitalist enterprise line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. During the Cultural Revolution, it was again this Chinese Khrushchev who pushed the reactionary bourgeois line, inciting people to fight against people, deepening their contradictions and making their opposition more severe. Today, in the study class, they study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, recall the bitter life of being child laborers in the old society together, and denounce the counter-revolutionary crimes of Chinese Khrushchev together. New and old grievances make them see more clearly the reactionary face of Chinese Khrushchev. From then on, the knot between the two was untied, and the "enemies" became a "red pair."

    狠抓阶级教育　斩断派性毒蛇
    广州大中型工厂在解放军帮助下迅速实现革命大联合
    人民解放军驻广州市各工厂毛泽东思想宣传队，热情协助各革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席最新指示，树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，狠抓阶级教育，促进各派群众克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，实现革命大联合和三结合。
    目前，广州市大、中型工厂百分之八十已经联合起来。驻厂解放军宣传队帮助各革命群众组织联合举办学习班时，各派群众虽然人坐到一块儿了，但一提起斗派性就出现了“冷场”或“争吵”现象。怎样解决这些问题呢？宣传队指战员经过认真分析，认为要学习好、落实好毛主席最新指示，打倒派性，促进革命大联合，就必须树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风。指战员们引导学员反复学习毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，提高大家斗私的自觉性。
    为了帮助各工厂的各派群众打倒派性，联合起来，共同对敌，指战员们在各个毛泽东思想学习班中，普遍采用回忆对比的方法，开展阶级教育。各群众组织的工人一起回忆旧社会受资本家剥削、压迫，弄得妻离子散，家破人亡的痛苦，控诉党内一小撮走资派在文化大革命中把革命工人打成“反革命”、“牛鬼蛇神”，挑起群众斗群众的滔天罪行，从而使工人群众认清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，什么是苦根，什么是甜源，加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解，认识到实现革命大联合的伟大意义。很多工人说：“千恨万恨，要恨党内一小撮走资派；千好万好，是毛主席领导得好。”“工人阶级是一根藤上的苦瓜。我们有共同的阶级利益，共同的革命目标，共同的阶级敌人，可是现在搞派性，打‘内战’，只能使亲者痛，仇者快。”许多工厂的工人通过回忆对比，阶级觉悟提高了，关系融洽了。一个工厂有一对四年没说过话的“老对头”。在文化大革命中，她们又参加了对立的两派组织，矛盾更加严重。在阶级教育中，她们共同找到了长期对立的原因。过去不团结，是由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派推行资本主义企业路线的毒害。文化大革命中，又是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，推行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，使她们间的矛盾加深，对立更加严重。今天，她们在学习班里，一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起忆旧社会当童工的苦难生活，一起控诉中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行，新仇旧恨，使她们更加认清了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动嘴脸。从此，两个人的疙瘩解开了，“冤家”结成了“一对红”。　（据新华社讯）
