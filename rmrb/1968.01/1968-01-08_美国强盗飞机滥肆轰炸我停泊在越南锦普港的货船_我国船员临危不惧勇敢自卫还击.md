	The U.S. imperialists, who have suffered repeated defeats in their aggression against Vietnam, on January 3 once again dispatched bandit aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 158 anchored at Vietnam's Cam Pha Port, injuring several of our crew members. This is the latest in a series of serious military provocations by the U.S. bandits against our country, following their savage attack on a Chinese cargo ship in a Vietnamese port on November 25 last year, which occurred in less than two months.

	On the morning of January 3, at 8:00 AM, while the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 158 was loading coal at Vietnam's Cam Pha Port, it was suddenly subjected to a savage aerial bombardment by U.S. bandit aircraft. Several of our crew members were injured, and the ship sustained severe damage. During the U.S. aircraft's attack, the entire crew of our cargo ship, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, remained fearless in the face of danger and bravely carried out self-defense and counterattacks.

    新华社河内五日电　在侵越战争中连遭惨败的美帝国主义，一月三日又出动强盗飞机，滥肆轰炸停泊在越南民主共和国锦普港的中国货船红旗一五八号，使我国船员多人受伤。这是美国强盗继去年十一月二十五日对停泊在越南港口的中国货船进行野蛮袭击后，在不到两个月的时间内，对我国采取了又一次极其严重的军事挑衅行动。
