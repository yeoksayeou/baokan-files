From the past year's practice, we have deeply felt that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is indeed a great enemy obstructing us from closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It is a poisonous snake that binds us from being liberated from the shackles of selfishness. Only by overthrowing this great enemy of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit can Chairman Mao's latest directives be fully implemented, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieve comprehensive victory.

Our factory's situation over the past year has been like this. After Chairman Mao's latest directive on "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions" was issued, various revolutionary mass organizations, due to the mischief of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, did not closely follow this directive. They continued to "fight for seats" and "struggle for the core," which obstructed the early realization of revolutionary great alliance. Later, with the help of the stationed PLA, all the workers in the factory seriously studied and propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives. They listed the crimes and drew the ugly images of factionalism, making it very despicable, thus quickly realizing the revolutionary great alliance.

However, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, like all reactionary things, if you do not strike it down, it will not fall. Even if it is temporarily struck down, it will rise again when the conditions are right. For example, after our factory achieved organizational great alliance, there were still people who attempted to rebuild the hills that had been leveled. In response to this factionalist evil wind, the stationed PLA actively guided everyone to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest directives, mobilizing everyone to fight factionalism, investigate its harm, dig out its roots, and conduct a thorough cleanup, thus further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance in thought.

In the issue of establishing a revolutionary three-in-one power organ, our factory also experienced setbacks. At that time, many revolutionary cadres were liberated but could not be well utilized. The main reason was that various revolutionary mass organizations took a utilitarian attitude towards cadres, "those who follow me prosper, those who oppose me perish." All cadres who had participated in opposing organizations were generally not willing to be combined, and even wanted to be overthrown. As a result, the revolutionary committee could not be established for a long time.

Later, the stationed PLA and the revolutionary committee preparatory group organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directives on correctly handling cadres. In various types of study sessions, everyone compared with Chairman Mao's latest directives, found the reasons for factionalism returning after the great alliance in the cadre issue, mainly that selfish thoughts such as fear of cadres' retaliation were at work. Everyone fiercely fought against selfishness, eradicated factionalism, correctly solved the cadre issue, and achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one."

In revolutionary practice, we have come to realize that factionalism is a stubborn ideological enemy. We must constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly strengthen proletarian party spirit, and only then can we eradicate factionalism.

    坚决斩断派性这条大毒蛇
    北京印染厂革命委员会
    从过去一年来的实践中，我们深刻体会到，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，确实是阻碍我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大敌，是束缚我们从“私”字的枷锁中解放出来的一条毒蛇。只有打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这个大敌，增强无产阶级党性，毛主席的最新指示才能全面落实、条条落实，无产阶级文化大革命才能取得全面胜利。
    我们厂过去一年来的情况就是这样。毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示发出后，各派革命群众组织，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，对这个指示跟得不紧，仍然在“抢席位”、“争核心”，结果阻碍了革命大联合的早日实现。后来在驻厂解放军的帮助下，全厂职工认真学习、宣传毛主席最新指示，并且给派性列了罪状、画了丑像，把它搞得很臭，才迅速实现了革命大联合。
    但是，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，同一切反动的东西一样，你不打，他就不倒。一时打倒了，气候适当它还会重新抬头。例如我们厂在组织上实现大联合后，仍然有人企图把已经铲平的山头重新垒起来。针对这种派性歪风，驻厂解放军积极引导大家深入学习毛主席的最新指示，发动人人斗派性，个个查危害，挖根子，对派性来了一个大扫除，才进一步从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    我们厂在成立革命三结合权力机构的问题上，也出现过反复。当时，不少革命干部解放了，却不能很好地得到使用。主要原因是各派革命群众组织，对干部采取“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”的实用主义态度。凡是参加过对立组织的干部，一概不愿结合，甚至要打倒。结果，革命委员会迟迟不能成立。
    后来，驻厂解放军和革筹小组组织大家反复学习毛主席关于正确对待干部的最新指示。在各种类型的学习会上，大家对照毛主席的最新指示，找出大联合后在干部问题上派性回头的原因，主要是怕干部打击报复等私心杂念在作怪。大家狠斗了私字，铲除了派性，正确解决了干部问题，实现了革命的“三结合”。
    在革命的实践中，我们认识到派性是一个顽强的思想敌人，我们必须不断地用毛泽东思想武装头脑，不断地增强无产阶级党性，才能根除派性。
