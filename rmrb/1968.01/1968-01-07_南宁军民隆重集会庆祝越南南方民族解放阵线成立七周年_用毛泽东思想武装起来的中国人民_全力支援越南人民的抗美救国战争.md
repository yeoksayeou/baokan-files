Nanning military personnel and civilians held a grand rally to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fully supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

A delegation led by Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam participated in the rally and was warmly welcomed.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 6th: Revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers stationed in Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held a grand rally today to enthusiastically celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to warmly welcome the delegation led by Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long, Deputy Head of the delegation Le Thi Chi, and Sam Loc.

At the beginning of the meeting, a telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho was read.

Comrade Wei Guoqing, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: Over the past seven years, the heroic people of South Vietnam, under the strong leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have held high the great banner of resistance against American aggression and national salvation, fully utilized the human factor, creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, and defeated the so-called powerful American aggressors, causing the situation in South Vietnam to undergo fundamental changes. The great victories of the South Vietnamese people further prove the correct judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies among the people." Wei Guoqing strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's use of the counter-revolutionary two-faced tactic of false support and real betrayal, actively serving the U.S. imperialists, and attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

Wei Guoqing concluded by saying: China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other. The people of Guangxi and the Vietnamese people share fields and villages, and in the long struggle against common enemies, they have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship. After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, and drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory.

Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long spoke at the meeting, saying that the brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese military and people signify the leapfrog development of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces, signify the continuous growth of the South Vietnamese people in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and signify the victory of the correct political and military lines of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He said, the people's war waged by the South Vietnamese people, which is invincible, is increasingly demonstrating its great power, and we have sufficient strength to defeat the American aggressors in any situation.

Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long said that the South Vietnamese people are very happy with the brilliant victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people and regard them as their own victories.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from Nanning spoke at the meeting. They firmly stated that the people of Guangxi, who are on the front line of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, will always regard the great victories achieved in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression as their own victories. They expressed their determination to follow the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, build Guangxi into a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people, and in the future days of struggle, no matter what difficulties and obstacles they encounter, they will always stand together with the heroic Vietnamese people, fight together, and win together.

Comrade Nguyen Thuan, a member of the delegation, introduced the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in their war of resistance against American aggression.

Members of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Le Thanh San, Deputy Consul General of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Consulate General in Nanning, Le Quang Tan, and Vietnamese trainees in Nanning attended the meeting. Members of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee, leaders of the Guangxi Military Region, and leaders of the Nanning garrison, as well as Comrade Ding Xilin, a member of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association who accompanied the Vietnamese comrades to Nanning, also attended the meeting.
