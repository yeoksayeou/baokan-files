The Japanese people in Sasebo launch a massive anti-American struggle

The headquarters of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association strongly protests the Sato reactionary government's collusion with the U.S. imperialists to sell out national interests

New China News Agency, January 19th: According to the Oriental News Agency, on the morning of the 19th, the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and two other nuclear ships, despite the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, forcibly entered the port of Sasebo, Japan. Brave Japanese patriotic workers and students, undeterred by the brutal suppression of the Sato reactionary government and unafraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, launched a large-scale anti-American patriotic struggle against the docking of U.S. nuclear ships in Sasebo.

In Sasebo, on the morning of the 19th, more than a thousand workers and students marched to the main gate of the U.S. military base. The Sato reactionary government deployed more than 2,000 police and a large number of armored vehicles in front of the U.S. military base, attempting to block the march. At the same time, the U.S. military dispatched helicopters to hover at low altitudes, attempting to intimidate them. However, the workers and students, fearless in the face of violence, engaged in a fierce struggle with the police.

Another group of about 500 students, in order to break through the bridge leading to the U.S. military base, fought with the police, who used tear gas and water cannons, for several hours.

Patriotic students tore down and burned the American flags and banners welcoming the U.S. military that the Sato government had hung in the streets of Sasebo to curry favor with the United States. Additionally, about 100 workers, aboard more than ten small boats, surrounded the "Enterprise," which was docked in the port, to hold a demonstration.

The students' brave struggle was warmly praised and supported by the citizens of Sasebo. Thousands of citizens cheered them on at the scene of the struggle.

The students who bravely fought in Sasebo had, since the 17th, broken through the numerous obstacles set up by the Sato reactionary government and rushed to Sasebo from Tokyo and various parts of the country. In the past few days, they had already held protests and demonstrations numerous times. On the afternoon of the 18th, they, together with workers and revolutionary people from western Japan and members of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association of Fukuoka Prefecture, held a massive demonstration march, bravely charging through the police's blockade line, and the struggle lasted for three hours.

In Tokyo, on the afternoon of the 18th, about 300 students held a demonstration march at the Prime Minister's Office.

The Sato reactionary government, despite the strong opposition of the broad masses of the people, allowed U.S. nuclear ships to enter the port of Sasebo, further exposing its traitorous face before the broad masses of the Japanese people.

New China News Agency, January 19th: According to the Oriental News Agency, the headquarters of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association on the 19th sent protest letters to Johnson and the Sato reactionary government regarding the entry of U.S. nuclear ships into the port of Sasebo, expressing strong protest against the entry of U.S. nuclear ships into Japanese ports and demanding that the U.S. nuclear ships immediately withdraw from Japanese ports.

The protest letter to Johnson stated: "The entry of U.S. nuclear ships into the port of Sasebo is 'turning Japan's territory and territorial waters into a nuclear base for the U.S.'s ongoing aggression against Vietnam. This is absolutely intolerable to the Japanese people."

The protest letter also pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' ongoing aggression against Vietnam is inseparable from their plan to invade China and Asia. The entry of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" into Japanese ports is also an act of hostility against China. The protest letter demanded that the U.S. government immediately withdraw its nuclear ships from Japan.

The protest letter to the Sato government pointed out that the Sato government has sold Japan's territory and territorial waters to U.S. imperialism and has become a nuclear base for the U.S.'s aggression against Vietnam. The protest letter strongly protested the Sato reactionary government's brutal suppression of the Japanese people's brave struggle against the entry of U.S. nuclear ships into Japanese ports. The protest letter demanded that the Sato reactionary government immediately stop suppressing the people and immediately revoke the decision to allow U.S. nuclear ships to dock in Japanese ports.

According to the New China News Agency, January 18th, according to the Oriental News Agency, the headquarters of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement on the 16th, strongly protesting the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government, allowing the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and other nuclear ships to dock in the port of Sasebo.

The statement pointed out: "This is a new criminal act of openly turning our country's territory and territorial waters into a nuclear base for the U.S.'s aggression against Vietnam, which is absolutely intolerable to the Japanese people." The statement said: The fighter-bombers launched from the "Enterprise" are weapons of massacre against the Vietnamese people. We will, together with the people of Asia, launch all effective struggles.

The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade on the 18th passed a resolution at its standing committee meeting, expressing resolute opposition to the entry of U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers into Japanese ports and lodging a serious protest with the Sato government and the U.S. government.

The trade union affiliated with the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade issued a statement on the 16th, resolutely opposing the entry of U.S. nuclear ships into Japanese ports and the evil act of attempting to turn Japan into a U.S. nuclear base. (Photo attached)

    不畏强暴不怕牺牲　坚决反对美国核舰只停泊
    日本人民在佐世保展开大规模反美斗争
    日中友协（正统）总部等强烈抗议佐藤反动政府勾结美帝出卖民族利益
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：十九日上午，美国核航空母舰“企业号”和另外两艘核舰只，不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，强行闯入日本佐世保港。英勇的日本爱国工人和学生，不怕佐藤反动政府的残暴镇压，不怕流血牺牲，展开了反对美国核舰只到佐世保港停泊的大规模的反美爱国斗争。
    在佐世保，十九日早晨，有一千多名工人和学生到美军基地正门游行。佐藤反动政府出动了二千多名警察和大批装甲车排列在美军基地前面，企图阻止游行队伍。同时，美军出动直升飞机在低空盘旋，进行恐吓。但是工人和学生不畏强暴，同警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    另一支约五百人的学生队伍，为了冲过通往美军基地的桥梁，同使用瓦斯枪和喷水龙头的警察进行了好几个小时的搏斗。
    爱国学生把佐藤政府为向美国谄媚而挂在佐世保市街道上的美国国旗和写着“欢迎美军”的横幅扯下来烧掉。另外，有一百名工人乘着十多只小船围绕着正在港口停泊的“企业号”举行示威。
    学生们的英勇斗争得到佐世保市民的热烈称赞和支持。数以千计的市民在斗争的现场声援他们。
    在佐世保英勇进行斗争的这些学生是十七日以来从东京和全国各地冲破佐藤反动政府设下的重重障碍而赶到佐世保来的。他们在过去几天里已经一次又一次地举行了抗议示威。十八日下午，他们曾同工人和西日本地区的革命人民和日中友好协会（正统）福冈县总部会员一起，举行了声势浩大的示威游行，勇敢地向警察布下的封锁线冲击，斗争长达三小时之久。
    在东京，十八日下午约有三百名学生曾经到首相府举行示威游行。
    佐藤反动政府不顾广大人民的强烈反对，让美国核舰只驶进佐世保港，从而在日本广大人民面前进一步暴露了它的卖国面目。
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）总部十九日就美国核舰只进入佐世保港口，分别向约翰逊和佐藤反动政府提出抗议书，表示强烈抗议美国核舰只进入日本港口，并且要求美国核舰只立即撤出日本港口。
    给约翰逊的抗议书说：美国核舰只进入佐世保港口，是“把日本的领土和领海公然变成美国正在进行的侵越战争的核基地。这是日本人民绝对不能容忍的。”
    抗议书还指出：美帝国主义正在进行的侵越战争是同侵略中国和亚洲的计划分不开的。美国“企业号”核航空母舰进入日本港口，也是对中国的敌对行动。抗议书要求美国政府立即把它的核舰只撤离日本。
    给佐藤政府的抗议书指出，佐藤政府已经把日本的领土和领海出卖给美帝国主义，并且成为美帝国主义侵越战争的核基地。抗议书还强烈抗议佐藤反动政府残酷镇压日本人民为反对美国核舰只进入日本港口所进行的英勇斗争，抗议书要求佐藤反动政府立即停止对人民的镇压，立即撤销允许美国核舰只在日本港口停泊的决定。
    据新华社十八日讯据东方通讯社报道，日中友好协会（正统）总部十六日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府互相勾结，让美国核航空母舰“企业号”等核舰只到佐世保港停泊。
    声明指出：“这是公然把我国的领土和领海作为美国侵略越南的核基地的新的犯罪行为，这是日本人民决不能容忍的。”声明说：从“企业号”上起飞的战斗轰炸机，是残杀越南人民的凶器。我们将同亚洲人民一起，展开一切有效的斗争。
    日本国际贸易促进协会十八日在常任理事会上通过一项声明，表示坚决反对美国核航空母舰进入日本港口，并向佐藤政府和美国政府提出严重的抗议。
