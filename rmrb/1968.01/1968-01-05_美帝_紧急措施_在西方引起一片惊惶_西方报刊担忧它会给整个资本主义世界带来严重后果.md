The five "emergency measures" hastily announced by U.S. President Johnson on New Year's Day to salvage the dollar crisis have caused strong unease both within the United States and abroad, particularly in Western Europe. Western capitalist newspapers and financial figures are worried that these measures will not only fail to rescue the precarious dollar but will also greatly exacerbate the contradictions among imperialist countries, further deepening the chaotic state of the capitalist world's financial and monetary system.

In its editorial on January 1, the *New York Times* described Johnson's measures as a "bitter pill" for the presidential election year. It acknowledged that these measures "will cause significant shock both domestically and internationally."

The *Washington Post* also published an editorial on the same day, stating that Johnson's "emergency measures" marked an "ominous start to the new year." The newspaper expressed doubts about the effectiveness of these measures.

Some capitalist newspapers in Western European countries, on one hand, gloated over the predicament reflected by Johnson's announcement of "emergency measures"; on the other hand, they worried that the U.S. measures would bring serious consequences to Western European countries and the entire capitalist world.

In its editorial on January 3, the *Times* of London mocked the United States, saying that Johnson's measures "presented a pathetic image of the United States on the defensive," marking a "major retreat" by the United States abroad. The newspaper expressed concern that these measures would have "dark consequences" economically and politically.

French financial figures believed that Johnson's actions confirmed their views about the dollar's plight and accused the United States of taking these measures to shift difficulties onto Western European countries.

De Gaulle's economic advisor, Lefeuvre, commented that Johnson's measures would only cause further chaos in Western finance.

*Le Parisien Libéré* believed that the U.S. measures "will damage the entire international monetary system" and will "directly and immediately harm the interests of the United States' partner countries in the world." Those countries that are "most dependent" on the United States will be hit the hardest.

The *Echo de Paris* anxiously pointed out that the U.S. "emergency measures" could lead to a crisis akin to the Great Depression of the 1930s, affecting the entire capitalist world.

For Britain, which is in extreme financial and economic difficulties, the U.S. measures are undoubtedly a blow. British officials openly expressed concern that Johnson's measures could make Britain's exports face even greater difficulties, worsening its international balance of payments and further damaging its economy.

Moreover, countries like West Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Japan have also expressed concern that the U.S. "emergency measures" will further intensify trade and currency wars in the capitalist world. Some West German capitalist newspapers used terms like "shock" and "anxiety" to describe West Germany's reaction to the U.S. "emergency measures." Some newspapers believed that the U.S. measures would have a "clear impact" on the West German economy.

    美帝“紧急措施”在西方引起一片惊惶
    西方报刊担忧它会给整个资本主义世界带来严重后果
    新华社四日讯　美国总统约翰逊匆匆在元旦日宣布的妄图挽救美元危局的五项“紧急措施”，在美国国内外，特别是西欧，引起了强烈的不安。西方资产阶级报刊和金融界人士担心，这些措施不仅挽救不了岌岌可危的美元，而只会大大加剧帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，进一步加深资本主义世界金融货币体系的混乱状态。
    《纽约时报》在一日的社论中认为，约翰逊的这些措施是今年总统选举年的一丸“苦药”。它承认，这些措施“在国内外引起的震动将会是很大的”。
    《华盛顿邮报》在同一天的社论中认为，约翰逊宣布的这些“紧急措施”是“新的一年的一个不祥的开端”。这家报纸表示怀疑这些措施到头来是否有效。
    西欧国家的一些资产阶级报纸，一方面对约翰逊宣布“紧急措施”反映出的美国狼狈处境表示幸灾乐祸；另一方面又担心美国的“紧急措施”会给西欧国家以及整个资本主义世界带来严重后果。
    伦敦《泰晤士报》在三日的社论中奚落美国说，约翰逊的这些措施“使人得到一个美国处于守势的可悲形象”，它标志着美国在国外作了“重大的撤退”。这家报纸表示担心，这些措施将在经济上和政治上产生“阴暗的后果”。
    法国金融界人士认为，约翰逊的行动证实了他们关于美元处在困境中的说法，并且指责美国采取这些措施，其目的是把困难转嫁给西欧国家。
    戴高乐的经济专家吕埃夫发表评论指出，约翰逊的措施只会给西方金融造成进一步紊乱。
    《今日巴黎报》认为，美国的措施“将会损害整个国际货币制度”，会“直接和立即损害美国的伙伴国在世界上的利益”；而那些平日“最依赖于”美国的那些国家，将会受到最直接的打击。
    法国《回声报》不安地指出，美国这些“紧急措施”可能会导致三十年代那样的波及整个资本主义世界的大危机。
    对于目前在财政经济上都深深陷入极端困难境地的英国来说，美国的这些措施更无疑是当头一棒。伦敦官方人士公开表示担心，约翰逊的措施可能使英国的出口遭到更大困难，从而使它的国际收支地位更加恶化，使它的经济进一步遭到打击。
    另外，西德、意大利、瑞典、日本等国也都表示担心，美国的“紧急措施”将进一步加剧资本主义世界的贸易战和货币战。一些西德资产阶级报刊用“震惊”、“忧虑”等词句，来形容西德对美国“紧急措施”的反应。有的报纸认为，美国的措施将会对西德经济产生“明显的影响”。
