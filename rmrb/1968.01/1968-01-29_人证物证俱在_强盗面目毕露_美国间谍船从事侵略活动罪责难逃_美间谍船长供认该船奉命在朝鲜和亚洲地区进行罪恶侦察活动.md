The captain of the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship "Pueblo," Lloyd Mark Bucher, answered questions from reporters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations on January 26. He admitted that they were captured while conducting extremely evil espionage activities in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after receiving a spy mission from the U.S. commander of the Seventh Fleet in Japan. Their espionage activities were completely in violation of the fundamental principles of international law and were acts of aggression and evil.

He confessed: "I belong to the U.S. Pacific Fleet."

"My ship is specially tasked with conducting espionage activities. Therefore, it is equipped with the most advanced necessary espionage equipment. Most of the crew have experience in espionage activities and master the corresponding technology."

"We have conducted espionage activities multiple times along the coasts of Korea and other regions in Asia."

"Our espionage activities are completely in violation of the fundamental principles of international law and are acts of aggression and evil."

"This espionage mission was given to me by the commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in Japan, Rear Admiral Frank Johnson, on December 2, 1967, in Sasebo, Japan. The main task of this espionage mission was to sail along the coast of the Soviet Far East and then conduct reconnaissance on the military targets along the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the distribution of radar networks, various radio waves, the maneuverability of the Korean People's Navy, the capacity of various ports, the number of ships entering and exiting, their capabilities, and to study the marine conditions along the coast."

"After entering the coastal waters of Korea, I conducted reconnaissance on the distribution of various military targets and radio waves in places such as Chongjin, Wonsan, and many others. In addition, we used various advanced observation instruments and espionage equipment to observe and investigate the depth, current, temperature, marine conditions, salinity, and transparency of the waters along the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and conducted reconnaissance on the radar network, the capacity of various ports, the number of ships entering and exiting, their capabilities, and the maneuverability of the ships of the Korean People's Navy."

He confessed that the two "civilian" personnel on the spy ship were actually special espionage personnel who disguised themselves as oceanographers to carry out military espionage missions.

"We have committed a serious crime. Our actions are purely acts of aggression and espionage."

The Central News Agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also published Bucher's confession on January 24.

He confessed that the spy ship entered the waters near the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on January 16, 1968, after passing through the coastal waters of the Soviet Maritime Territory to conduct espionage activities. He said, "Our actions were blatantly in violation of the Armistice Agreement and were acts of aggression. The crimes committed by me and my subordinates are indelible."

    人证物证俱在　强盗面目毕露
    美国间谍船从事侵略活动罪责难逃
    美间谍船长供认该船奉命在朝鲜和亚洲地区进行罪恶侦察活动
    新华社二十八日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，被朝鲜人民军海军俘获的美帝国主义武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”船长劳埃德·马克·布克二十六日回答了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国报纸、通讯社和电台记者的问题。他承认，他们是在接受了美国驻日本海军司令的间谍使命后，深入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海从事极其罪恶的间谍活动时被俘的。他们的间谍活动，完全是违反国际法根本准则的侵略和罪恶行动。
    他供认：“我属于美国太平洋舰队。”
      “我的船专门负责进行间谍活动。所以船上装备有最先进的必要的间谍仪器。大多数船员都有从事间谍活动的经验并掌握相应的技术。”
      “我们曾多次在朝鲜和亚洲其他地区沿海进行间谍活动。”
      “我们的间谍活动完全是违反国际法根本准则的侵略和罪恶行动。”
      “这次间谍任务是美国驻日本海军司令弗兰克·约翰逊海军少将于去年十二月二日在日本的佐世保港交给我的。这次间谍任务主要是要在苏联远东沿海航行以后侦察朝鲜民主主义人民共和国海岸沿线的军事目标，雷达网的分布情况，各种电波，朝鲜人民军海军的机动性，各港口的容纳能力，出入的舰艇数目和它们的能力，以及研究海岸沿线的海洋情况。”
      “在侵入朝鲜沿岸水域以后，我侦察了清津、元山和其他许多地方的各种军事目标的分布情况和各种电波。此外，我们用各种最新式的观测仪器和间谍设备观测和探查了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿岸水域的水深、水流、水温、海洋状况、盐度和透明度，侦察了雷达网、各港口的容纳能力、出入的舰艇数目及它们的能力和朝鲜人民军海军舰艇的机动性。”
    他供认在间谍船上的两名“文职”人员实际上是特殊的间谍人员，他们伪装成海洋学家来执行军事间谍使命。
    “我们犯的罪很严重，我们的所做纯粹是侵略和间谍的行为。”
    朝鲜中央通讯社二十四日还公布了布克的供词。
    他供认，间谍船是在一九六八年一月十六日，经过苏联滨海边疆区进入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国靠近海岸的海面进行间谍活动的。他说，“我们的行动是明目张胆地违反停战协定的罪恶行动，是道道地地的侵略行动。”“我和我部下所犯的罪行是完全抹拭不掉的。”
