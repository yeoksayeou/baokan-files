In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's latest battle call, the military and civilian population of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam have achieved a brilliant victory in the battle of Khe Sanh, annihilating 1,600 enemy troops from January 3rd to 7th.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 12th, the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency reported that the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam's Quang Nam Province have been advancing in victory, launching fierce attacks on the enemy in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent new battle call. From the 3rd to the 7th, they achieved a brilliant victory in the Khe Sanh area, annihilating 1,600 enemy troops.

Among the annihilated enemy forces, two American army battalions were completely wiped out, and three other battalions were severely damaged.

In this battle, the people's liberation armed forces also shot down and destroyed 39 enemy aircraft, destroyed 17 tanks, demolished one ammunition depot, and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

To rescue the desperate situation in Khe Sanh, the American aggressors sent the 196th Infantry Brigade from Chu Lai to reinforce on the 7th. As soon as this enemy brigade left the Chu Lai base, it was fiercely intercepted by the people's liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province, suffering heavy losses. The report said that the battle in Khe Sanh is still ongoing.

According to another report, on the night of the 3rd, the people's liberation armed forces bombarded the enemy's airbase in Ban Me Thuot while simultaneously striking three hangars with heavy weapons, destroying 15 enemy aircraft. The people's liberation armed forces also bombarded the enemy's headquarters in Ban Me Thuot, destroying the residence of the puppet provincial governor, and attacked the command post of the puppet 45th Regiment, burning down a military supply warehouse. The office of the puppet government in Phu Yen Province was also destroyed by the artillery of the liberation armed forces.

The people's liberation armed forces in Phu Yen Province ambushed and annihilated more than 150 American troops of the 173rd Airborne Brigade that were air-dropped in the coastal area of Thua Thien Province on December 27th last year, and shot down two helicopters.

From December 26th to 31st last year, the military and civilian population of the Central Highlands proactively attacked the enemy. The military and civilian population of Gia Lai and Kontum Provinces intercepted the enemy's "sweeping" operations to the west of De Do and attacked the enemy in some areas of Kontum Province, annihilating 322 American and puppet troops.
