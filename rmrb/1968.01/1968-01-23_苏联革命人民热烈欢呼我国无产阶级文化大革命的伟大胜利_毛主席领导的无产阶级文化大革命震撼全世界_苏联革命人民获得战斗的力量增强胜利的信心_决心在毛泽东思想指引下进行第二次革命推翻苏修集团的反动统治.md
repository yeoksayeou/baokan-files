The great victory of the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has dealt a heavy blow to the modern revisionists in the Soviet Union and has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. Over the past year, more and more revolutionary people in the Soviet Union have seen through the shameless slanders and vicious attacks by the Soviet revisionist leadership against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have seen a bright future in this great revolution, gained strength for their struggle, and increased their confidence in victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Deals a Heavy Blow to the Soviet Revisionists

The great teacher of the contemporary proletariat, Comrade Mao Zedong, systematically summed up the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship and the serious lessons of the complete restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. He thoroughly and completely solved the most important contemporary issue of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shook the world, smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, prevented the Soviet tragedy from being repeated in China, and shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism of restoring capitalism in China. This great revolution has had a profound educational and influential effect on revolutionary people all over the world and in the Soviet Union, raising their understanding of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—and pointing out the direction for their struggle and progress.

From the very beginning of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique sensed their impending doom. From their reactionary standpoint, they were terrified and enraged by this great revolution. The anti-China resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Soviet Union in December 1966 warned that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had reached a new and dangerous stage of striking at the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful."

Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk, in order to obstruct the irresistible influence of Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the Soviet people, to maintain their shaky reactionary rule, and to prevent the Soviet people from rising up against them and overthrowing them under the influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have engaged in unprecedented frenzied anti-China activities over the past year. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and other Soviet revisionist leaders have repeatedly taken to the stage to engage in anti-China ranting. In their public anti-China propaganda, the Soviet revisionist leadership has fabricated all sorts of lies, gone to great lengths to distort facts and turn black into white, and viciously slandered and attacked China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought. On the other hand, they shamelessly claimed that the Soviet Union had already carried out a cultural revolution, that there were no privileged strata, and that capitalism had not been restored, and so on. The Soviet revisionist leadership's despicable political deception fully exposed their weak essence and inner fear, indicating that they were very afraid that the Soviet revolutionary people would rise up against them and overthrow them under the influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Advances the Historical Process of World Revolution

The Soviet revisionist clique's vicious slanders and attacks on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought have met with shameful failure. The awakening revolutionary people of the Soviet Union do not believe the Soviet revisionists' various anti-China clamor. A young worker in Irkutsk said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is a great leader. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct. Currently, Soviet newspapers are saying bad things about China's cultural revolution, but I don't believe it."

An elderly woman in Leningrad told a Chinese comrade: "Your Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is very good. We don't believe the Soviet newspapers' distorted reports about China." A teacher in Sochi said: The Soviet radio "broadcasts nothing but slanderous rumors about China, but the Soviet people don't believe it." Some students said: "Pravda has no truth, Izvestia has no news. We don't believe these newspapers."

Clouds cannot obscure the sun, and lies cannot cover the truth. After learning the true situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through various channels, many Soviet working people enthusiastically praised, sincerely supported, and highly evaluated this great revolution. A Soviet student said: "China's great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard movement are very important historical events. It ensures the accelerated development of China's socialist construction and ensures that Chinese youth will forever inherit and develop the revolutionary cause of their predecessors." An elderly Soviet sailor said excitedly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is very good. It proves that after the proletariat seizes power, it must go through such a great revolution to consolidate the power and prevent the emergence of a new bourgeoisie and new exploiters." Another Soviet citizen enthusiastically praised: "The Red Guards' rebellion is good!" A worker in Kiev said: "Your Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct. I hope you will carry out this cultural revolution to the end."

The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union pointed out that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only to China but also to the Soviet Union and the whole world. A Soviet citizen said: "The great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution far exceeds the scope of China. This is not only a new chapter in Chinese history but also a brilliant example that has a revolutionary impact on the entire historical process of the world." Another Soviet citizen pointed out passionately: "Lenin once led the great October Revolution, and his name spread all over the world. Today, Comrade Mao Zedong is leading China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and his name is also spreading all over the world. The influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also like the October Revolution, spreading all over the world."

With Mao Zedong Thought, There is Hope for Revolution

The brilliant victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired the Soviet revolutionary people who are waging a tough struggle against the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule. They have gained great enlightenment from China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further recognized the crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership in restoring capitalism, and realized that this group of traitors is the arch-criminal who betrayed the cause of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union. They are determined to overthrow the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule. A Soviet female worker told a Chinese comrade: "Your Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is truly excellent! We Soviet workers fully agree with your approach. New capitalists and landlords have emerged here. We need a new revolution." An ordinary Soviet laborer tightly grasped the hand of a Chinese comrade and said excitedly: "Our leaders have betrayed the revolution. You have inherited the revolution. With you, the revolution has hope." Several Soviet workers said: The upper-level figures in the Soviet Union are the ruling clique on the capitalist road. The Soviet Union needs a great revolution to overthrow all these ruling cliques. A Soviet worker said: "In the Soviet Union, a second revolution must be carried out. We must learn from the spirit of rebellion of the Chinese Red Guards, rebel against Brezhnev and Kosygin, and reestablish a Soviet Socialist Republic under the dictatorship of the proletariat." A young student said firmly: "We must overthrow the current government and carry out a thorough revolution!"

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made more and more revolutionary people in the Soviet Union realize: Chairman Mao is the greatest teacher and most outstanding leader of the contemporary proletariat, and Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people; only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought and using it to guide their struggle can they overthrow the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule and bring the Soviet Union back to the socialist track. An old worker in Irkutsk said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people all over the world." An old Soviet worker said excitedly: "The Soviet people need to carry out a second revolution. Mao Zedong Thought will help us carry out the second revolution." Another Soviet worker said: "Only Mao Zedong Thought can correctly guide the Soviet people's forward direction." An old Soviet sailor said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. We Soviet people love Chairman Mao and believe in Mao Zedong Thought without limit. The Soviet people need the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the second revolution. We Soviet people must resolutely follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, bravely fight, break through the dark rule of the revisionist clique, and let the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought fly over the Kremlin!"

The revolutionary speeches of the ordinary working people of the Soviet Union are full of revolutionary passion, reflecting their limitless love for the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and their limitless belief in the great Mao Zedong Thought. It reflects the strong revolutionary will of the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and expresses their fighting spirit and common revolutionary oath.

The great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and state in the Soviet Union has now been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the vast majority of the people and party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The attacks by the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought not only deceive the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union but also further expose their traitorous faces. Let these anti-China clowns go on shouting in despair. The comprehensive victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will undoubtedly give greater inspiration to the revolutionary people of the entire Soviet Union. The Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, through their own heroic struggle, overthrow the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule and rebuild the proletarian dictatorship in Lenin's homeland, the Soviet Union.

    苏联革命人民热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利
    毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命震撼全世界
    苏联革命人民获得战斗的力量增强胜利的信心
    决心在毛泽东思想指引下进行第二次革命推翻苏修集团的反动统治
    据新华社二十二日讯　本社记者报道：我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，给苏联现代修正主义者以沉重的打击，给苏联革命人民以极大的鼓舞。一年多来，苏联广大革命人民越来越识破了苏修领导集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命的种种无耻诬蔑和恶毒攻击。他们从这场伟大革命中，看到了光明的前途，获得了斗争的力量，增强了胜利的信心。
  文化大革命沉重打击苏修集团
    当代世界无产阶级的伟大导师毛泽东同志，系统地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，总结了苏联资本主义全面复辟的严重教训，完整地、彻底地解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命、防止资本主义复辟这一个当代最重大的课题。震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，防止了苏联的悲剧在中国的重演，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的梦想。这场伟大的革命极其深刻地教育和影响了全世界革命人民和苏联革命人民，提高了他们对当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的认识，给他们指出了斗争和前进的方向。
    从中国无产阶级文化大革命一开始，苏修叛徒集团就预感到了自己末日的来临。他们从自己的反动立场出发，对这场大革命怕得要死，恨得要命。苏修一九六六年十二月中央全会通过的反华决议，惊呼中国的无产阶级文化大革命对苏修反动统治的打击“已进入新的危险的阶段”。
    毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，为了阻挠战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命对苏联人民日益深入的影响，继续维持他们摇摇欲坠的反动统治，最近一年多来，空前疯狂地进行反华活动。勃列日涅夫、柯西金等苏修头目还多次赤膊上阵，在各种场合进行反华叫嚣。苏修领导集团在这些公开的反华宣传中，捏造种种谎言，极尽歪曲事实、颠倒黑白之能事，恶毒地诬蔑和攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的毛泽东思想。另一方面，他们恬不知耻地胡说什么苏联“已经进行了文化大革命”，“没有特权阶层”，“不是资本主义复辟”等等。苏修领导集团的这种卑鄙的政治欺骗行径，充分暴露了他们的虚弱本质和内心的恐惧，表明他们十分害怕苏联革命人民在中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下起来造他们的反，革他们的命。文化大革命推进世界革命历史进程
    苏修集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的毛泽东思想的恶毒诽谤和攻击遭到了可耻的破产。日益觉醒的苏联革命人民根本不相信苏修的种种反华鼓噪。伊尔库茨克一位青年工人说：“毛泽东同志是伟大的领袖。中国无产阶级文化大革命是正确的。目前苏联报纸把中国文化大革命说得很糟，我就不相信。”
    列宁格勒一位老年妇女对中国同志说：“你们进行的无产阶级文化大革命好得很。我们谁也不相信苏联报纸对中国的歪曲报道。”索契的一位苏联教师说：苏修电台“尽播送诬蔑中国的谣言，可是苏联人民不相信。”一些大学生说：“《真理报》没有真理，《消息报》没有（真实的）消息。我们都不相信这些报纸。”
    乌云遮不住太阳，谎言掩盖不住真理。许多苏联劳动人民通过各种途径了解到中国无产阶级文化大革命的真实情况以后，都热烈赞扬、衷心支持和高度评价这场伟大的革命。一位苏联学生说：“中国的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动，是十分重大的历史事件。它保证中国社会主义建设加速发展，保证中国青年永远继承和发展父辈的革命事业。”一位苏联老海员激动地说：“毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命非常好，它证明了在无产阶级取得政权以后，一定要通过这样一场大革命，才能巩固政权，才能防止产生新的资产阶级和新的剥削者。”另一位苏联公民热烈地赞扬说：“红卫兵造反就是好！”基辅的一位工人表示：“你们的无产阶级文化大革命是正确的，希望你们把这场文化大革命进行到底。”
    苏联革命人民指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对中国，而且对苏联，对全世界，都具有极其重大的意义。一位苏联公民说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响远远超出了中国的范围。这不仅是中国历史中的新篇章，而且也是对整个世界历史进程起着革命影响的卓越范例。”另一位苏联公民满怀激情地指出：“列宁曾领导伟大的十月革命，他的名字传遍全世界。今天，毛泽东同志领导着中国的无产阶级文化大革命，他的名字也传遍全世界。中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响也和十月革命一样，传遍全世界。”
  有毛泽东思想，革命就有了希望
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，给了正在同苏修集团反动统治进行着艰苦斗争的苏联革命人民以极大的鼓舞。他们从中国无产阶级文化大革命中得到了很大的启发，进一步认识到了苏修领导集团复辟资本主义的罪行，认识到这伙叛徒就是出卖苏联无产阶级专政事业的罪魁祸首，决心推翻苏修的反动统治。一位苏联女工对中国同志说：“你们的无产阶级文化大革命真是好极了！我们苏联工人完全同意你们的做法。我们这里又产生了新的资本家和地主。我们需要一场新的大革命。”一位苏联普通的劳动者紧紧地握着中国同志的手激动地说：“我们的领导背叛了革命，你们继承了革命，有了你们，革命就有了希望。”几位苏联工人说：苏联的上层人物是走资本主义道路的当权派。苏联需要一场大革命，要把这些当权派全部打倒。一位苏联工人说：“在苏联一定要进行第二次革命。我们要学习中国红卫兵的造反精神，造勃列日涅夫、柯西金的反，重新建立一个无产阶级专政的苏维埃社会主义共和国。”一位青年学生坚决地说：“我们要推翻现政权，彻底闹革命！”
    史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，使越来越多的苏联革命人民认识到：毛主席是当代无产阶级最伟大的导师和最杰出的领袖，毛泽东思想是无产阶级和广大革命人民最强大的思想武器；只有掌握毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导自己的斗争，才能推翻苏修反动统治，使苏联重新回到社会主义的轨道上来。伊尔库茨克一位老工人说：“毛泽东同志不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”一位苏联老工人激奋地说：“苏联人民需要进行第二次革命，毛泽东思想将帮助我们进行第二次革命。”另一位苏联工人说：“只有毛泽东思想才能正确地指引苏联人民前进的方向。”一位苏联老海员说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。我们苏联人民无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。苏联人民需要毛泽东思想的指引，进行第二次革命。我们苏联人民要坚决走毛泽东主席指出的道路，勇敢地战斗，冲破修正主义集团的黑暗统治，让马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜在克里姆林宫上空飘扬！”苏联普通劳动人民这些充满革命激情的豪言壮语，洋溢着对世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限信仰，反映了苏联广大革命人民坚强的革命意志，表达了他们战斗的心声和共同的革命誓言。
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想的攻击，不仅蒙骗不了苏联革命人民，反而进一步暴露了他们自己的叛徒面目。让这些反华小丑们去绝望地叫喊吧。中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，必将给予苏联全国革命人民以更大的鼓舞。具有光荣的革命传统的苏联人民，必将在毛泽东思想的指引下，通过自己的英勇斗争，推翻苏修反动统治，在列宁的故乡苏联，重建无产阶级专政。
