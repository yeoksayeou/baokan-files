	The Story of the Ninth House in a Fishing Village

	Comrade, have you heard the story of the ninth house in a fishing village? In the depths of the Yellow Sea, there is a crescent-shaped small island with a fishing village of only eight households. The coastal defense outpost made of blue stones is the "ninth house" of this fishing village. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "ninth house" and the villagers established a new friendship under the great call of Chairman Mao's "support the army and love the people." The PLA brought Chairman Mao's thoughts to us.

	The production team leader of this small fishing village, Wei Xi, is an old poor peasant who has endured the whip of the fishing tyrant for over twenty years. Although he is over sixty, he is serious and responsible about collective matters. When the Cultural Revolution began, one day, a big-character poster was pasted on him by the villagers: "Wei Xi, old team leader, your democratic style is not strong enough. You decide everything yourself, and you shouldn't forget the mass line!" Wei Xi got angry when he saw it: "No merit, just hard work! Being an official is just hard work without any reward!" He was so angry that he wanted to quit.

	During the study class discussion, everyone spoke passionately, but only Team Leader Wei kept his head down, just smoking. Platoon Leader Li Xin'an thought, "Team Leader Wei's mind is in turmoil!"

	After class, the platoon leader went to Team Leader Wei's home, and the two sat on the edge of the kang (a traditional heated bed) to have a heart-to-heart talk.

	The platoon leader said, "Grandpa, our village has nine households. Who will take care of the revolution and production if no one does?"

	Team Leader Wei said, "Let those who want to do it do it!"

	Seeing that Team Leader Wei was still upset, the platoon leader patiently guided him: "Grandpa, can we let Xu Xie manage our village's affairs?"

	These words reminded Team Leader Wei of his bitter past: Xu Xie was the fishing tyrant on the island. Wei Xi had worked for him for twenty-eight years, eating pig and dog food, wearing "thousand-layer clothes," and in the end, he still owed four dan of grain. His wife led the children to beg for food. Xu Xie not only didn't give them anything but also let his dogs bite his wife's leg...

	Thinking about it, Team Leader Wei shed tears.

	Seeing Team Leader Wei's tears, the platoon leader took out the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him.

	The platoon leader said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and pointing out our shortcomings.' The villagers' criticisms are political care for us; the power of the production team, who should hold it if not us poor and lower-middle peasants? We must listen to Chairman Mao's words!"

	At this moment, Team Leader Wei stood up, holding Li Xin'an's hand and said, "Platoon Leader, it's all my fault for not studying Chairman Mao's books well. In the old society, working for the fishing tyrant, we suffered so much. Today, serving the people is an endless honor, why should we complain? This is all about forgetting our roots and being selfish! I must fight against selfishness and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, 'completely' and 'thoroughly' hold and use power for the poor and lower-middle peasants."

	From then on, Team Leader Wei changed his work style and actively led all the villagers to seize the revolution and promote production. The villagers said, "'The ninth house' not only dug wells and brought water to our village but also brought Mao Zedong Thought to us. This is truly a blessing in disguise!"

	Everyone in the Family is a Fighter

	One evening, under the organization of Platoon Leader Sun Wende, the old poor peasant Wei Xi's family of four generations held a family criticism meeting against the fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Sun Wende first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and then criticized the reactionary remarks of "exploitation is meritorious" and "peasants welcome exploitation." As soon as Sun Wende finished speaking, Wei Xi's wife, Zhao Yuzhen, angrily said, "The Chinese Khrushchev's words are similar to what Xu Xie said. In 1944, I borrowed three dan of high-quality sorghum from Xu Xie, with interest added to the principal, and I couldn't pay it off in three years. At that time, Xu Xie's catchphrase was 'no exploitation, no wealth,' which is exactly the same as 'exploitation is meritorious'!"

	Old Grandma Wei said, trembling with anger, "I've lived for over eighty years, and I've experienced all kinds of hardships in the old society. The grain we harvested and the fish we caught were all exploited by the fishing tyrants. If it weren't for the exploitation of the fishing tyrants, why would we poor people suffer?" Saying this, her tears had already reached the corners of her mouth.

	At this moment, Wei Xi's sixteen-year-old granddaughter, Wei Shuqin, the second platoon leader of the women's militia artillery company, returned from the production team. Without even eating dinner, she joined the criticism meeting. She said, "We have suffered enough from exploitation and endured enough hardships from exploitation. The Chinese Khrushchev says we 'welcome exploitation,' which is a smear on us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must resolutely criticize and expose him!"

	As soon as Wei Shuqin finished speaking, Zhao Yuzhen took out several paper rolls from behind her and shook them open with a rustle. These were the satirical cartoons she had drawn herself. This sixty-something-year-old woman used to be able to draw, but she only drew chickens, ducks, cats, dogs, flowers, and trees. When the soldiers helped her study Chairman Mao's works and introduced her to Gu Atiao, who used drawings to study Chairman Mao's works and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, she said, "Gu Atiao can draw to study Chairman Mao's works and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, so can I!" So, she picked up her pen and drew satirical cartoons. She pointed to a drawing of the Chinese Khrushchev holding a black axe and chopping down a fruit-laden peach tree, saying, "This peach tree is the people's commune. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to chop it down, which is against socialism!" Finally, Wei Xi spoke for the whole family: "We four generations will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and defend Chairman Mao to the death!"

	People and Spirit Changed

	For decades, a folk song has been passed down in the small fishing village: "The mountains are high, the wind is strong, the rain is heavy, but the corn and crops do not grow." Can the fishing village really not produce grain?

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of the "ninth house" propagated Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to think, speak, and act. Chairman Mao's words pointed the way forward for the eight poor and lower-middle peasants of the fishing village. From then on, the barren mountains and hills became lively. They dug stones to build dams, moved soil to create fields, and when large stones couldn't be moved, they broke them up and carried them away. Small stones were sifted out with sieves. Soldier Luo Rongshan's hand was crushed by a stone, bleeding profusely, but he still insisted on working. Under the leadership of the "ninth house," the eight households, with the spirit of "seizing the day," waged a battle against the barren mountains. They managed to open up over a hundred plots of land, large and small, totaling more than six mu, breaking the old habit of several hundred years and planting corn, soybeans, peanuts, and other grain and oil crops.

	The thoughts and spirits of the nine households changed, the remote fishing village changed, and the barren hills changed their appearance. Red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" boards were planted all over the slopes, and layer upon layer of terraced fields turned green. The nine households were filled with joy.

	In autumn, the small fishing village achieved a bumper harvest, producing more than five thousand jin of grain for the first time.

	Comrade! After reading these stories, can you still think that this is just a fishing village with only nine households? No, this is clearly a microcosm of the close unity of the military and people across the country under the sun of the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    渔村“第九户”的故事
    同志，你听说过渔村“第九户”的故事吗？在那黄海深处的一个马蹄形小岛上，有一个只有八户居民的小渔村。那青石头墙的海防哨所，就是这渔村的“第九户”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，“第九户”和渔村群众在毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召下，又建立了新的友谊。解放军给咱送来毛泽东思想
    这个小渔村的生产队长魏喜，是一个在渔霸皮鞭下扛了二十多年活的老贫农，虽然已年过六旬，对集体的事却是认真负责。文化大革命开始时，有一天，社员给他贴了一张大字报：“魏喜魏喜老队长，民主作风不太强，遇事个人说了算，群众路线不该忘！”魏喜一看就来了火：“没有功劳，还有苦劳，当干部就是出力不讨好！”一赌气，想不干了。
    学习班上课讨论时，大家都热烈地发言，唯有魏队长低头不语，只是叭达叭达地抽烟。哨长李信安想，魏队长脑子里正在打架呢！
    下课后，哨长到魏队长家里，两个人坐在炕沿上谈心。
    哨长说：“大爷，咱渔村九户人家，抓革命、促生产的事可不能没人管哪！”
    魏队长说：“谁爱管谁就管吧！”
    哨长看魏队长还有气，就耐心地启发他：“大爷，咱村的事叫徐蝎子管行吗？”
    一句话勾起了魏队长的辛酸往事：徐蝎子是岛上的渔霸，魏喜给他打了二十八年鱼，吃的猪狗食，穿的“千层衣”，到头来还欠下四斗债。老伴领着孩子去讨饭。徐蝎子不但不给，还放出恶狗咬伤了大腿……
    想着想着，魏队长流下了泪水。
    哨长看魏队长流了泪，便拿出红彤彤的毛主席著作，和魏队长一起学习了《为人民服务》。
    哨长说：“毛主席教导我们：‘因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。’社员给咱提意见，是从政治上对咱的爱护；生产队的权，咱贫下中农不掌谁掌？咱可要听毛主席的话呀！”
    这时，魏队长站了起来，拉着李信安的手说：“哨长，都怪我没学好毛主席的宝书。旧社会给渔霸扛活，咱受苦受罪，今天为人民服务无限光荣，为什么却计较起来了呢！这都是忘本，都是‘私’字作怪！我一定要狠斗‘私’字，坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，‘完全’、‘彻底’为贫下中农掌好权，用好权。”
    从此，魏队长改变了工作作风，积极领导全村渔民抓革命促生产。群众都说：“‘第九户’不光给咱村挖井送水，还给咱村送来了毛泽东思想，这真是雪里送炭哪！”
    全家都是战斗员
    一天晚上，在哨所班长孙文德的组织下，老贫农魏喜全家四代人针对中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“剥削有功”的谬论，召开了家庭批判会。孙文德首先组织大家学习了毛主席的最新指示，然后批判了“剥削有功”和“农民欢迎剥削”的反动言论。孙文德刚讲完，魏喜的老伴赵玉珍气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这话和徐蝎子说的差不多。一九四四年，俺借徐蝎子三斗高粱，本加利，利滚利，还了三年没还完。那时徐蝎子的口头禅是‘不剥削不富’，这和‘剥削有功’是一模一样！”
    魏老大娘说到中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”，气得颤抖抖地说：“我活了八十多岁，旧社会样样苦都受过。收的粮，打的鱼，都叫渔霸剥削去了，不是渔霸剥削，咱穷人为什么受苦？”说着说着泪珠已经淌到嘴角上了。
    这时，魏喜十六岁的孙女、民兵三八炮班二班长魏淑琴从生产队回来了，看全家正在批判中国赫鲁晓夫，饭也没顾得吃，就参加了批判会。她说：“我们吃尽了剥削的苦，受尽了剥削的罪，中国赫鲁晓夫却说我们‘欢迎剥削’，这是给咱贫下中农栽赃抹黑，我们要坚决把他批倒批臭！”
    魏淑琴的话音刚落，赵玉珍从身后拿出几个纸卷，哗的一声抖开。这是她亲手画的批判漫画。这位六十多岁的老太太，从前就会画画，不过画的都是些鸡鸭猫狗，花草树木。当哨所战士帮助她学习了毛主席著作，向她介绍了顾阿桃用画写学习心得和批判中国赫鲁晓夫后，她说：“顾阿桃能画画学习毛主席著作，批判中国赫鲁晓夫，我也要画画批判资产阶级！”于是，她提笔画批判漫画。她指着一张中国赫鲁晓夫恶狠狠地举着黑斧头砍一棵果实累累的桃树的画，说：“这桃树是人民公社，中国赫鲁晓夫要砍倒它，就是反对社会主义！”最后，魏喜说出了全家人的心里话：“我们四代人永远心向毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席！”人变精神地变貌
    几十年来，小渔村里流传着“山大风大雨水大，不长包米和庄稼”的民谣。渔村真的不能生产粮食吗？
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，“第九户”的战士，宣传了毛主席的敢想、敢说、敢做的教导。毛主席的话给渔村八户贫下中农指明了前进的方向。从此，荒山秃岭顿时热闹起来，挖石垒堰，移土造田，大石头搬不动，打碎它抬走，小石头用筛子筛出去。战士罗荣山的手被石头压破了，鲜血直流，仍然坚持干下去。在“第九户”的带动下，八户群众以“只争朝夕”的精神，向荒山开战，硬是在青面板上开出大小一百多块土地，足有六亩多，破除了几百年来的老习惯，种上了包米、大豆、花生等粮油作物。
    九户人家的思想变了，精神变了，偏僻的渔村，荒秃的山岭也改变了面貌。红彤彤的毛主席语录板插满山坡，层层梯田绿油油。九户人家充满了喜悦。
    秋天，小渔村夺得了大丰收，破天荒地生产了五千多斤粮食。
    同志！当你看了这些故事后，你能认为这只是一个只有九户人家的渔村吗？不，这分明是在伟大的毛泽东思想的阳光普照下，全国军民紧密团结的缩影！
