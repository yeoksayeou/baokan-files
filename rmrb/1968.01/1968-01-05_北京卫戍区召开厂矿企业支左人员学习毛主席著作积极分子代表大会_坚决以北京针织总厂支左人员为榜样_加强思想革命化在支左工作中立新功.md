The Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army recently held a conference for the active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works among the left-supporting personnel in Beijing factories and mines. The conference, held under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as its guiding principle. It took the left-supporting personnel of the 8341st Unit in the Beijing Knitting Factory as an example, seriously summarizing and exchanging experiences from the past nine months of left-supporting work in actively applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, and strengthening ideological revolutionization. All representatives at the conference decided, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to implement the experiences of the left-supporting personnel in the Beijing Knitting Factory into their own work, further strengthen ideological revolutionization, and excellently complete the left-supporting tasks assigned by Chairman Mao, seizing comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Since mid-March last year, the left-supporting personnel of the People's Liberation Army have been stationed in Beijing factories and mines. They have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "support the broad leftist masses," making the arming of revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought the fundamental task of left-supporting work. They enthusiastically helped revolutionary workers actively apply Chairman Mao's works, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and powerfully promoted the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination in factories and mines, as well as the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. They have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. The representatives attending this conference reviewed the nine months of struggle and deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding all work, the soul commanding everything, and the sharpest weapon for transforming everything. All achievements in left-supporting work come from the great Mao Zedong Thought and are credited to the great leader Chairman Mao.

During the conference, the representatives listened to the introduction of left-supporting experiences by the 8341st Unit and visited the Beijing Knitting Factory to learn from it. The representatives excitedly pointed out that the left-supporting personnel in the Beijing Knitting Factory have persistently propagated Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believed in and relied on the masses, resolutely executed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They are indeed a red flag of left-supporting work shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, pointing the direction for our left-supporting work and setting a model. Everyone, according to the three principles implemented by the 8341st Unit in the Beijing Knitting Factory, compared themselves item by item, word by word, and letter by letter, finding gaps and making plans, launching a learning and catching-up wave. They proposed in repeated studies and discussions that the experiences of the left-supporting personnel in the Beijing Knitting Factory are very rich and comprehensive, and to master these experiences, one must fundamentally learn: first, learn their fundamental attitude of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and resolutely implementing every instruction from Chairman Mao, seeing immediate results. Second, learn their focus on the fundamentals, no matter how tight the schedule or how heavy the tasks, they always prioritize the active application of Chairman Mao's works in all work, with the most enthusiastic political passion to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and seriously do in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work. Third, learn their firm belief in and reliance on the masses, deeply integrating with the masses, becoming one with them, willingly being students of the masses, and resolutely supporting the left without supporting factions. Fourth, learn their adherence to the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, taking "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as the guiding principle, sparking a revolution in their souls, treating themselves as a revolutionary force, and constantly treating themselves as the object of the revolution, doing a good job in ideological revolutionization.

The conference, taking the left-supporting personnel of the 8341st Unit in the Beijing Knitting Factory as an example, deeply discussed the issue of ideological revolutionization among left-supporting personnel. The representatives pointed out that being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the fundamental standard for ideological revolutionization. The representatives said that to do a good job in ideological revolutionization, one must persistently actively apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, without relaxing for a moment, implementing every word and letter. In left-supporting work, one must stand out politically the busier the work is, grasp the fundamentals the heavier the tasks are, and consult Chairman Mao's works more the greater the difficulties are. One must also frequently go deep into the masses, treat the masses as teachers, and humbly learn from the masses. They said that the left-supporting personnel in the Beijing Knitting Factory, with the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, compared themselves daily with the shining images of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains, strictly required of themselves, and in the struggle against selfishness and for the public good, actively launched an offensive, persistently carried out regular rectification, dared to make public self-criticisms among the masses, and set a shining example for us. Every left-supporting personnel must be like them, demanding high standards of themselves, high styles of self-examination, high attitudes of accepting criticism, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to guide every word and action, directing every move in left-supporting work, and always letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guide us forward.

During the conference, the second political commissar of the Beijing Garrison, Huang Zuojin, the deputy commander, Pan Yongti, and the deputy political commissar, Zhou Shuqing, each spoke to the representatives. They encouraged all representatives to maintain a humble, prudent, guard-against-arrogance, and guard-against-impatience style, and emphasized that the three principles implemented by the left-supporting personnel in the Beijing Knitting Factory are universally applicable principles in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. Every left-supporting unit must seriously learn from the left-supporting personnel of the 8341st Unit, genuinely master their good experiences, and let the three principles bloom and bear fruit universally.
