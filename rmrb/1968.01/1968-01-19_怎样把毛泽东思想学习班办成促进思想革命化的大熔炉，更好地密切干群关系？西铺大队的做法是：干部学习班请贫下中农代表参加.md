The West Bank Brigade of Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, invited poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes as teachers, helping cadres to criticize and repudiate their selfishness and revisionism. This significantly enhanced the cadres' awareness of self-criticism, promoted the ideological revolutionization of the cadres, and established a new type of relationship between cadres and the masses.

Some new cadres in the leadership team of the West Bank Brigade are enthusiastic about their work but are busy with administrative tasks and have little contact with the masses. The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the study class frankly criticized the cadres, saying, "Some cadres have small positions but many tasks and a lot of nagging, scolding the masses more and gesturing more." They believed that one of the main reasons for the cadres' alienation from the masses is that they have become too official and participate in labor less. Some cadres could not accept the masses' sharp criticism at first, thinking that as cadres, their main task is to get the work done; participating in more labor would affect the work. To address this issue, the comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team studied with the cadres Chairman Mao's teachings on "The cadres of our Party and state are ordinary workers, not overlords sitting on the heads of the people," helping the cadres understand that alienation from labor and the masses would lead to degeneration and corruption.

After the study, the cadres felt that the masses had helped them find the key to the problem. They happily accepted the masses' opinions and decided to never detach themselves from labor, no matter how high their positions, and to always stay with the masses, maintaining the character of ordinary workers. Old cadre Zhang Ziming had a deep understanding, saying, "In the past wartime years, although I was a platoon leader, I shared life and death with the soldiers, suffered together, and was very close to them. Now, the longer I have been a cadre, the more official I have become, gradually alienating myself from the masses." Based on the masses' opinions and actual needs, the revolutionary leadership cadres of the brigade reallocated their work. If one person can handle a task, they would not assign two; if a task can be completed in half a day, they would not use a full day, freeing up manpower and time to labor with the masses. New cadre Wei Changshun was originally in charge of reception work. No matter how many visitors came, he had to stay in the brigade to handle it. Now, if someone comes, he handles the reception; if no one comes, he goes to the fields to labor with the masses. Sometimes after finishing the reception work, even if only half an hour is left, he would go to the fields to labor with the masses.

The revolutionary cadres of the West Bank Brigade, together with the masses, criticized and repudiated their selfishness and revisionism, significantly promoting ideological revolutionization. They deeply felt, "Inviting representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants to the study class, exposing and criticizing their selfishness in front of the masses, turned the study class into a crucible for ideological revolutionization and a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works."

    怎样把毛泽东思想学习班办成促进思想革命化的大熔炉，更好地密切干群关系？西铺大队的做法是：
    干部学习班请贫下中农代表参加
    河北省遵化县建明人民公社西铺大队的革命领导干部，在北京部队某部毛泽东思想宣传组帮助下，根据毛主席“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的教导，把贫下中农请到毛泽东思想学习班来当老师，帮助干部斗私批修，大大提高了领导干部斗私的自觉性，促进了领导干部的思想革命化，建立了新型的干群关系。
    西铺大队领导班子里有些新干部，工作热情很高，但忙于事务，接触群众少。贫下中农代表在学习班里，开门见山给干部提出尖锐的批评说：有些干部是“官不大，事不多，罗嗦不少”，“对群众训斥多，指手划脚多”。他们认为，干部脱离群众的一个重要原因，就是“官”架子大了，参加劳动少了。有的干部听了群众的尖锐批评后，开始接受不了，认为当了干部，主要是把工作搞好；多参加劳动必然影响工作。针对这种活思想，毛泽东思想宣传组的同志就和干部一起学习毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷”的教导，启发干部认识脱离劳动，脱离群众，就会逐渐蜕化变质的道理。
    经过学习，干部们感到群众帮助自己找到了问题的关键，愉快地接受了群众的意见，决心做到不论职位高低，永远不脱离劳动，永远和群众在一起，永远保持普通劳动者的本色。老干部张子明深有体会地说：“过去在战争的年代，虽然自己是排长，但是和战士同生死，共患难，亲密无间。现在，当干部的时间长了，‘官’气大了，逐渐脱离了群众。”大队革命领导干部根据群众意见，从实际需要出发，重新进行了分工。一个人能办的事，不安排两个人；半天能办完的事，不用一天办，腾出人力、时间，和群众在一起劳动。新干部魏长顺原来分工搞接待，不管参观来访的人次多少，整天都要呆在大队照应。现在有人来，就搞接待；没人来，就下地和群众一起参加劳动。有时搞完接待工作，就是剩下半个小时，也要到地里和群众一起劳动。
    西铺大队的革命干部和群众一起斗私批修，大大促进了思想革命化。他们深有感触地说：“把贫下中农代表请到学习班来，在群众面前亮私斗私，就使学习班成了促进思想革命化的熔炉、活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。”
