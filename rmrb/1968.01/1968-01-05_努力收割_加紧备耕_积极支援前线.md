Members of agricultural cooperatives across North Vietnam are concentrating their efforts to urgently harvest late-season rice while vigorously promoting spring plowing preparations. They have put forth the slogan, "Harvest where you can, plow where you can."

In Thai Binh Province, more than 70% of the labor force participates in harvesting and winter plowing every day. Due to good organization of labor, many agricultural cooperatives harvest rice during the day and thresh it at night. Each cooperative has established plowing teams, engaging in heated competitions to significantly accelerate the initial plowing of early rice fields.

Last year, Phu Tho Province had a good late-season rice harvest, with many new varieties achieving high yields. In Hai Duong Province, agricultural cooperative members increased their workdays during the busy season, striving to harvest during the day and thresh at night. Young volunteers took on the heaviest tasks, rushing to the most difficult and dangerous areas to harvest.

Agricultural cooperative members across North Vietnam are enthusiastically selling agricultural products to the state, actively supporting the frontline.

    努力收割　加紧备耕　积极支援前线
    本报讯　越南北方各地农业社社员在集中力量紧张地收割晚稻的同时，正大力促进冬春的备耕工作，提出了“收割到那里，犁地到那里”的口号。
    太平省每天都有百分之七十以上的劳动力参加收割和冬耕工作。由于劳动力组织得好，许多农业社白天割稻，晚上打谷。各农业社还成立了犁地组，相互展开热火朝天的竞赛，使早稻田初耕的速度大大提高。
    富寿省去年晚稻收成很好，许多新谷种都取得高产量。海阳省农业社员在农忙季节中，增加了工日，他们争取在白天收割，晚上打谷。青年突击队员承担了最繁重的劳动，他们争先恐后地奔向最困难和最危险的地区去收割。
    越南北方各地农业社社员正在踊跃向国家交售农产品，积极支援前线。
