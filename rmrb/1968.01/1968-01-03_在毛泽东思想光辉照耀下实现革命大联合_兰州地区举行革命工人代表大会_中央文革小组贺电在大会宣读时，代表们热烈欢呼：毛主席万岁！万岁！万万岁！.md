In the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, a great unity in revolution has been achieved. A revolutionary workers' congress was held in the Lanzhou region.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the congress, which was read aloud at the meeting. The representatives enthusiastically cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

According to Xinhua News Agency in Lanzhou on January 1, the province of Gansu has brought good news: the revolutionary workers in the Lanzhou region have achieved great unity in revolution. From December 25 to 30, 1967, the revolutionary workers' congress of the Lanzhou region was successfully held.

This congress was convened under the radiance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and in the great situation where the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Gansu Province and the whole country has achieved decisive victories.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the congress. The telegram from the Central Cultural Revolution Group reflects the warm concern of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the workers of the Lanzhou region and the 13 million people of Gansu Province. When the telegram was read at the congress, the representatives were overjoyed, and many of them had tears of happiness, repeatedly shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

The broad revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou region resolutely carry out the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, and have achieved revolutionary great unity in most factories, mines, and grassroots units. So far, more than 400 grassroots units have established revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs—the revolutionary committees—after achieving revolutionary great unity. About 85% of the hundreds of thousands of workers in the Lanzhou region have united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This congress is a congress of great unity and solidarity of the revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou region, a mobilization congress to further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in thought, work, and organization by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and a rally congress to organize and educate the ranks of the working class with Mao Zedong Thought and to determine to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. Before this congress, the Lanzhou region held the red revolutionary congress of middle schools and the revolutionary congress of agriculture. The holding of these representative congresses marks that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Lanzhou region and Gansu Province has entered a new stage.

Xu Guozhen, the responsible person of the Lanzhou Military Region and deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: In sailing the vast ocean, the helmsman is needed; in making revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is needed. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental of building the ranks of the working class. We must take the study, execution, promotion, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought as our lifelong combat mission. We must put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything, studying every day and combining study with application, seeing immediate results. We must be like the heroes of the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, truly loving what Chairman Mao loves, supporting what Chairman Mao supports, following what Chairman Mao instructs, and advancing when Chairman Mao waves his hand. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, promote the revolutionization of thought, resist and eliminate the infiltration and influence of various bourgeois thoughts, and maintain the purity of the working class in politics, thought, and organization. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

At this congress, the revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou region exchanged experiences in achieving and consolidating revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, promoting production while making revolution, and the revolutionization of the leading cadres' thought. They said, thousands of experiences and tens of thousands of experiences, the most fundamental experience of all our victories is to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions without any deviation, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

In the midst of the most enthusiastic applause and cheers, the congress passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The congress also passed the congress resolution and the "Letter to All Revolutionary Workers in the Province," as well as the list of committee members of the congress leadership.

Attending the congress were also Zhang Dazhi, Yang Jiarui, and Gao Weisheng, responsible persons of the Lanzhou Military Region; Li Shumao, a member of the preparatory committee of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee; Zhang Zhong, a responsible person of the Gansu Military Region and deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee; and Hu Jizong, a revolutionary leading cadre and deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

    据新华社兰州一日电　甘肃省传来了振奋人心的喜讯：兰州地区广大革命工人实现了革命大联合。一九六七年十二月二十五日至三十日，兰州地区革命工人代表大会胜利举行。
    这次大会是在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在甘肃省和全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下召开的。
    中央文革小组为大会发来了贺电。中央文化革命小组的贺电，体现了伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对兰州地区工人阶级和甘肃省一千三百万人民的亲切关怀。当大会宣读贺电时，代表们欣喜若狂，许多人含着幸福的泪花，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    兰州地区的广大革命职工，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，在大多数厂矿和基层单位实现了革命的大联合。到目前为止，已有四百多个基层单位在实现革命大联合之后，建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构——革命委员会。兰州地区的数十万工人阶级已有百分之八十五左右在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合了起来。这次大会，是兰州地区革命工人大联合、大团结的大会，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在思想上、工作上、组织上进一步落实毛主席一系列最新指示的动员大会，也是用毛泽东思想组织和教育工人阶级队伍，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的誓师大会。这次大会以前，先后召开了兰州地区中学红代会和农代会。这些代表大会的举行，标志着兰州地区和甘肃省的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新的阶段。

    在这次大会上，兰州地区革命职工交流了实现和巩固革命大联合、革命三结合的经验，抓革命促生产的经验，以及领导班子的思想革命化等经验。他们说，千条经验，万条经验，我们取得一切胜利的最根本的一条经验，就是不折不扣地按毛主席的指示办事，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    在最热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，大会通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    会上还通过了大会决议和《告全省革命工人书》，通过了工代会领导机构的委员名单。
