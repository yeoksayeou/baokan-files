Edition: 2

The "Dongfeng" ship is 161.4 meters long, with a displacement of over 18,800 tons, and a cargo capacity of over 11,700 tons. It has a speed of 17 knots per hour. It can sail continuously at sea for 40 days and nights without stopping at any port, reaching Europe, Africa, or America directly. The main engine of the "Dongfeng" ship is the first 8,820 horsepower low-speed heavy-duty diesel engine designed and manufactured in China. This engine is about four stories high, weighs approximately 400 tons, and is composed of over 50,000 parts. It is an extremely complex product with very high precision requirements. The ship also has nearly 300 sets of machinery and electrical equipment. The total power generation capacity of the ship can supply lighting for a small city with a population of over 100,000. All these equipment and materials come from nearly 300 factories in 18 provinces and cities across the country. Many of them are newly developed ship-use products with higher technical requirements specifically manufactured for the "Dongfeng" ship.
