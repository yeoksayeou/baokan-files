The people of Portuguese Guinea, Angola, and Mozambique are fighting back against colonial forces with high spirits, achieving new victories in their long-term armed struggles. The patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea have liberated more than half of the country's territory. The armed activities of Angola's patriotic forces have expanded, and the patriotic armed forces of Mozambique have already controlled some regions.

New China News Agency, January 19th: The revolutionary people of Portuguese Guinea, Angola, and Mozambique, who have been fighting armed struggles for a long time, achieved new victories in their struggles against Portuguese colonialists supported by American imperialism in 1967. Whether in armed struggles or in opening up and consolidating bases, they have made significant progress. Currently, the people of the Portuguese colonies in Africa are full of confidence in victory and are determined to achieve greater victories in the armed struggles of the new year.

According to reports, the people of Portuguese Guinea have been fighting armed struggles since August 1961. In 1967, they repelled multiple counterattacks by the Portuguese colonial army and maintained the initiative in combat.

In the last few months of last year, the patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea launched continuous attacks, killing a large number of enemies. In just twenty days at the end of last year, they annihilated more than 130 Portuguese colonial soldiers. Under the heavy blows of the patriotic armed forces, the Portuguese colonial army is besieged in some cities and larger strongholds, forced to hide in shelters all day; the roads and waterways under colonial control are becoming increasingly unsafe.

After years of arduous struggle, the brave patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea have liberated more than half of the country's territory and control the main agricultural areas. In the liberated areas, the patriotic armed forces have vigorously developed production. Due to the increase in newly cultivated land, rice and other grain crops have seen increased yields; handicrafts have also developed, and a soap factory using palm oil has been established in the northern base area. The patriotic armed forces have also vigorously carried out literacy campaigns. So far, 127 primary schools have been established in the liberated areas, with 13,000 students. Before the armed struggle began, the entire Portuguese Guinea had only 56 primary schools, with just 2,000 students.

In addition, in Cape Verde, the patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea have also achieved significant results in mobilizing the masses to support the armed struggle both materially and spiritually.

The patriotic armed struggle of the people of Angola has entered its eighth year. Facing the brutal suppression of more than 70,000 Portuguese colonial soldiers, the people of Angola are fearless, full of fighting spirit, and confident in victory. In the past year, they have achieved significant victories, dealing heavy blows to Portuguese colonialism. According to reports, from October 1966 to August 1967, the patriotic armed forces of Angola annihilated more than 1,900 Portuguese colonial soldiers, shot down five enemy planes, destroyed 30 enemy vehicles and seven small boats, and seized a large number of weapons supplied to the Portuguese colonial army by the United States, Israel, and West Germany. The patriotic armed forces of Angola also successfully attacked an enemy concentration camp, freeing 250 Angolans held there.

The patriotic armed forces of Angola are continuously expanding their areas of activity. Currently, in addition to the fighting in the Cabinda Peninsula, the battles have spread to the northern regions of Dembos and Southern Bungo, as well as the eastern regions of Musseque and Cuando.

The patriotic armed forces of Mozambique have persisted in advancing their armed struggle under difficult conditions. Throughout last year, they used various methods such as ambushes and raids to severely strike the Portuguese colonialists. Currently, the patriotic armed forces have controlled vast areas in the northern provinces of Delagoa Bay and Niassa. In November and December of last year, the patriotic armed forces of Mozambique launched a series of major military operations against the enemy in the western regions of Niassa Province, achieving new victories. On November 3, the patriotic armed forces ambushed a Portuguese patrol, killing 15 enemy soldiers. On November 22, the patriotic armed forces ambushed a Portuguese colonial army attempting to raid a village in Niassa Province, killing 12 enemy soldiers and wounding 10. The next day, the patriotic armed forces attacked the enemy's camp in Longo, killing 25 enemy soldiers, forcing the enemy to abandon the camp and flee in all directions. On December 12, the patriotic armed forces shelled the Portuguese colonial army outpost near Lake Niassa, destroying two enemy ships and annihilating more than 20 enemy soldiers.

    新华社十九日讯　坚持长期武装斗争的“葡属”几内亚、安哥拉和莫三鼻给革命人民，一九六七年在同美帝国主义支持下的葡萄牙殖民主义者的斗争中，无论在武装斗争方面，还是在开辟和巩固根据地方面，都取得了新的胜利。目前，葡属殖民地的非洲人民满怀着胜利的信心，决心在新的一年的武装斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    据报道，自一九六一年八月以来一直坚持武装斗争的“葡属”几内亚人民，在一九六七年粉碎了葡萄牙殖民军的多次反扑，一直保持着战斗的主动权。
    在去年的最后几个月里，“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量不断出击，大批消灭敌人，仅在去年年底的二十天内，就歼灭了葡萄牙殖民军一百三十多名。在爱国武装力量的沉重打击下，葡萄牙殖民军困守在一些城市和较大的据点，被迫整天躲在掩体中；殖民军控制下的公路和水路交通也越来越不安全。
    英勇的“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量经过几年的艰苦战斗，已经解放了全国一半以上的国土，控制了各主要农业区。在根据地内，爱国武装大力发展生产。由于增加了新开垦的土地，大米等粮食作物获得了增产；手工业也得到了发展，在北部根据地还建立了一个用棕榈油制造肥皂的工厂。爱国武装还大力展开扫盲工作，到目前为止，已在根据地开办了一百二十七所小学，学生人数达一万三千人。在展开武装斗争以前，整个“葡属”几内亚只有五十六所初级小学，学生仅二千人。
    另外，在佛得角岛，“葡属”几内亚爱国武装在动员群众从物质上和精神上支持武装斗争方面，也取得了重大成绩。
    安哥拉人民的爱国武装斗争已进入了第八年。面对着七万多葡萄牙殖民军的疯狂镇压，安哥拉人民不畏强暴，斗志昂扬，充满胜利的信心。他们在过去一年多的斗争中取得了重大胜利，给葡萄牙殖民主义者以沉重打击。据报道，从一九六六年十月到一九六七年八月的战斗中，安哥拉爱国武装歼灭了葡萄牙殖民军一千九百多名，击落敌机五架，击毁敌军车辆三十辆、小汽船七艘，缴获大批由美国、以色列和西德供应葡萄牙殖民军的武器。安哥拉爱国武装还成功地袭击了敌人的一个集中营，释放了关在那里的二百五十名安哥拉人。
    安哥拉爱国武装不断在扩大活动范围。目前，战斗除了在喀奔达半岛进行以外，已经发展到北部的丹博斯和南布安古地区以及东部的穆西库和宽多地区。
    莫三鼻给爱国武装力量在困难的条件下坚持把武装斗争推向前进。在去年一年中，他们用袭击和伏击等各种办法，狠狠打击葡萄牙殖民主义者。目前，爱国武装已经控制了北部的德尔加多角省和尼亚萨省的广大地区。去年十一月和十二月，莫三鼻给爱国武装向尼亚萨省西部地区的敌军采取了一系列重大的军事行动，取得了新的胜利。十一月三日，莫三鼻给爱国武装伏击了一支葡萄牙巡逻队，打死敌军十五名。十一月二十二日，爱国武装又伏击了一支企图偷袭尼亚萨省一个村子的葡萄牙殖民军，打死敌军十二人，打伤十人。第二天，爱国武装又袭击了敌人在这个省的龙胡军营，歼灭敌军二十五人，迫使敌人丢弃这个营地，四散逃跑。十二月十二日，爱国武装炮轰了尼亚萨湖附近的科布的葡萄牙殖民军哨所，击毁了葡萄牙殖民军海军的两只船艇，歼灭敌军二十人以上。
