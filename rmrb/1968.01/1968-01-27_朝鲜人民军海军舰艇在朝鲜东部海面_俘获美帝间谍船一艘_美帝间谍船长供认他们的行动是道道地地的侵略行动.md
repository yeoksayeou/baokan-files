North Korean People's Army naval vessels captured a U.S. spy ship in the eastern waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The U.S. spy ship captain admitted that their actions were outright acts of aggression.

New China News Agency, January 26th—According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency, on the 23rd, the naval vessels of the North Korean People's Army captured a U.S. spy ship in the eastern waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the coordinates 127 degrees 46 minutes 9 seconds east longitude and 39 degrees 17 minutes 4 seconds north latitude. After being discovered by the naval vessels of the North Korean People's Army while intruding into the coastal waters of Korea, the U.S. spy ship continued to resist. The naval vessels of the North Korean People's Army retaliated, killing and wounding several U.S. aggressor troops and capturing over eighty.

The spy ship, named the "Pueblo," has a displacement of over one thousand tons and is equipped with anti-aircraft guns. The ship carries dozens of weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, as well as a large amount of equipment for espionage activities.

According to the report, the captain of the spy ship, Lloyd M. Bucher, admitted to the espionage activities carried out by U.S. imperialist aggressors.

He said: "My ship was dispatched to Sasebo, Japan, to carry out a mission assigned by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency."

He said: "On January 16, 1968, we entered the waters near the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after passing through the coastal regions of the Soviet Union. Our actions were blatant violations of the armistice agreement and were outright acts of aggression."
