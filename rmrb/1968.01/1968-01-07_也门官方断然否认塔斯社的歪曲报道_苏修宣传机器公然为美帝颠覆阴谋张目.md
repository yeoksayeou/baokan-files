Yemen officials strongly deny distorted reports by Tass
Soviet revisionist propaganda machine openly supports U.S. imperialist subversion plot

	NEW DELHI, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, Yemen's Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, Mustafa Yacob, announced in Cairo on January 3 that Yemen's Prime Minister, Amri, had instructed the Yemen Embassy in the United Arab Republic to strongly deny a report by the London radio station based on a Tass report. The report included groundless statements about the situation in Sana'a.

	Yacob said he regretted that some news agencies and radio stations had stooped to quoting such statements. He stressed that the situation in Sana'a is normal.

	In recent days, the U.S. imperialist plot to attack the Yemeni capital Sana'a and overthrow the Yemeni republican government has been met with strong resistance from the Yemeni government and people. However, the Soviet revisionist propaganda machine, Tass, issued a report on January 2, exaggerating that "the situation in the Sana'a region is deteriorating," blatantly serving the U.S. imperialist plot. After Tass issued this report, some Western news agencies and radio stations quoted it and reported on it.

    也门官方断然否认塔斯社的歪曲报道
    苏修宣传机器公然为美帝颠覆阴谋张目
    新华社五日讯　据中东通讯社报道：也门驻阿联大使穆斯塔法·雅各布三日在开罗宣布，也门总理阿姆里已经指示也门驻阿联大使馆，要断然否认伦敦电台根据塔斯社而报道的消息，其中包括关于萨那局势的毫无根据的消息。
    雅各布说，他对一些通讯社和广播电台竟堕落到引用这些说法表示遗憾。他强调说，萨那的局势是正常的。
    最近以来，美帝国主义策划的窜犯也门首都萨那和颠覆也门共和政权的阴谋，遭到了也门政府和人民的有力反击。但是，美帝国主义的帮凶苏联修正主义的宣传机器塔斯社二日却发出一条消息，大肆渲染，说什么“萨那地区局势正在恶化”，竭力为美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋效劳。塔斯社这条消息发出后，一些西方通讯社和广播电台纷纷引用这条消息而加以报道。
