The liberation army of New An-Ha Tien region in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on Bau Chinh town in Thuong Nghia province in the early hours of January 8, achieving a great victory after more than an hour of intense battle, in which over 1,100 enemy troops were killed, wounded, or captured. Among the casualties were seven companies, six platoons, and one "pacification" unit of the puppet army, and one battalion of the puppet army was severely damaged.

The liberation army also destroyed 21 buildings of the puppet provincial government and military administrative agencies, two ammunition depots, one oil storage facility, and 41 military vehicles.

The report said that the liberation army temporarily controlled the entire town of Bau Chinh. During this period, they opened the prison and freed over 80 people who had been imprisoned by the enemy, severely punished some criminals, and disbanded the puppet government organizations.

The people of Bau Chinh town held a rally with drums and gongs, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the liberation army. The town was adorned with flags of the National Liberation Front.

At the same time as the attack on Bau Chinh town, the liberation army also heavily bombarded the headquarters of the puppet 25th Division in De And district, the training camp of the Kien San and Tra Khe commando units commanded by American troops, and many other important strongholds, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

While the enemy was still in shock, the liberation army launched another heavy bombardment on the Thuong Nghia military sub-district on the night of January 9 to the early morning of January 10, annihilating nearly 50 more enemy troops who had just been deployed there.

Under the heavy blows of the liberation army, the enemy was terrified, and many puppet soldiers and puppet government officials deserted.

According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation Communications Agency, the military and people of My Tho province in South Vietnam, in the two weeks leading up to January 10, continuously attacked the enemy in the northern region of the Fourth Highway, killing nearly 1,800 enemy troops. They annihilated six companies (including two companies of American troops) and one battalion command post, shot down 22 enemy aircraft, and sank one military boat.

The report said that from December 28 last year to January 5 this year, the military and people of My Tho province bravely fought in My Tho city and other places, annihilating a large number of enemy troops. On January 6, 7, and 8, they launched fierce attacks on the puppet army in Dong Phu Yen and My Thuan communes of Cai Lay district, and My Thuan commune, annihilating over 300 enemy troops. They also annihilated one company and severely damaged two companies of the enemy army.

On January 10, the American invaders hastily sent troops to reinforce the beaten puppet army, but as soon as they entered Thu My commune and had not yet stabilized, the liberation army launched a fierce attack, annihilating two companies of American troops, severely damaging one company, shooting down many enemy aircraft, and sinking one military boat.

According to another report, the liberation army of Dinh Tuong province launched a fierce attack on the enemy's Van Long military sub-district on January 7, killing, wounding, and capturing 352 enemy troops, destroying six cannons and mortars, two ammunition depots, and capturing two strongholds.

The liberation army soldiers of Quang Tri province in South Vietnam are preparing for an attack. This heroic unit once annihilated over 200 American invaders in the battle of Yeu An and was awarded the title of "Unit that Annihilated Americans."
