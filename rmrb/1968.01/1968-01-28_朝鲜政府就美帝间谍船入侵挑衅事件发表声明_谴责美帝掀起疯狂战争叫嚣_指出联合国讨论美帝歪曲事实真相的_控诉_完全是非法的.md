The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has issued a statement condemning the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship "Pueblo" for invading the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and engaging in hostile actions. The statement also denounces the U.S. imperialists' frenzied war hysteria and their attempt to bring the "Pueblo" incident to the United Nations to cover up their criminal acts.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The U.S. imperialists are once again acting arrogantly, using the United Nations to achieve their aggressive goals. The U.S. imperialists have lodged a "complaint" with the United Nations Security Council, claiming that our capture of the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship "Pueblo," which was engaged in hostile actions after invading the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is a "violation of international law."

This is the most shameless, arrogant, and brutal behavior of bandits.

The recent "Pueblo" incident has fully exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

The specially equipped spy ship "Pueblo," loaded with various espionage devices, was captured by the naval vessels of the Korean People's Army on January 23 of this year in our territorial waters at 39 degrees 17 minutes 4 seconds north latitude and 127 degrees 46 minutes 9 seconds east longitude in the East Korean Bay. At that time, the ship, under the orders of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, had deeply invaded our territorial waters and was conducting espionage activities in many places, targeting a series of military secrets and state secrets, including various ports and military facilities along the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the deployment of armed forces, and industrial facilities.

The U.S. imperialist aggressors have consistently violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and have repeatedly carried out military provocations against the northern half of the Republic.

The provocative actions of the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship "Pueblo" are another blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, a direct aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and a link in the chain of planned conspiracies by U.S. imperialism to launch a new war in Korea. This is a serious threat to peace in the Far East and other regions of the world.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people resolutely condemn these despicable and criminal conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

The Korean people have taken decisive self-defense measures against the unforgivable aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism, which is entirely correct.

The U.S. imperialists are now raising a frenzied war hysteria, bringing the "Pueblo" incident to the United Nations to cover up their criminal acts and to defend them. On the other hand, they claim that they will mobilize large-scale armed forces to take "retaliatory measures."

However, no matter what the U.S. imperialists do, they cannot cover up their ugly aggressive nature, nor can they intimidate the Korean people.

The heroic Korean People's Army and all the Korean people are fully prepared to deal with any provocation or invasion by the U.S. imperialists. If the enemy dares to attack, they will be given a devastating blow.

The United Nations should not repeat its shameful history of being used as a tool by U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Korea. It is illegal for the United Nations to discuss the U.S. imperialists' distorted "complaints" about the facts.

Defending the security and sovereignty of the motherland from enemy invasion is an inviolable right of every independent country and an internal affair that no one can interfere with.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly opposes the discussion of the U.S. imperialists' illegal "complaints" in the United Nations Security Council, will not recognize any resolution aimed at covering up U.S. imperialist aggression, and will declare such resolutions null and void.

If the United Nations wants to act in accordance with its charter and mission, it must condemn the U.S. imperialists' aggressive actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and take measures to stop their activities aimed at provoking a new war.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people are confident that all socialist countries, Asian and African independent nations, and all progressive people in the world who cherish peace and justice will closely monitor the serious situation created by U.S. imperialism in Korea, wage a resolute struggle to cut off the claws of U.S. imperialist aggression, and actively support and stand in solidarity with the Korean people in their just struggle to defend national dignity and state sovereignty.

    朝鲜政府就美帝间谍船入侵挑衅事件发表声明
    谴责美帝掀起疯狂战争叫嚣
    指出联合国讨论美帝歪曲事实真相的“控诉”完全是非法的
    新华社二十七日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府二十七日发表声明，谴责美帝国主义武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海采取敌对行动；谴责美帝国主义掀起疯狂的战争叫嚣，把“普韦布洛号”事件提到联合国去，妄图掩盖它的犯罪行为。
    声明全文如下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府声明
    美国帝国主义现在又猖狂起来了，利用联合国来达到其侵略目的。美国帝国主义向联合国安全理事会提出“控诉”，叫嚷什么我们俘获在侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海后正在采取敌对行动的美帝国主义武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”的自卫行动，是“违反国际法”的。
    这是最无耻、最狂妄和最蛮横的强盗行径。
    最近的“普韦布洛号”事件，更彻底地暴露了美国帝国主义的侵略本性。
    配备着各种谍报设备的特种武装间谍船
  “普韦布洛号”，是由朝鲜人民军的海军舰艇于今年一月二十三日在我方领海内，在东朝鲜湾北纬三十九度十七分四秒、东经一百二十七度四十六分九秒俘获的，其时该船根据美国中央情报局的命令，在深深侵入了我国领海之后，正在许多地方对一系列的军事秘密和国家秘密，诸如各个港口和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海的各种军事设施、武装力量的部署和工业设施进行间谍活动。
    美国帝国主义侵略者一贯地破坏朝鲜停战协定，并且不断地对共和国的北半部进行军事挑衅活动。
    美国帝国主义武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”的挑衅行动，是又一个悍然违反朝鲜停战协定的行动，是对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的公开侵略，是美国帝国主义想在朝鲜发动新战争的有计划的阴谋活动锁链中的一个环节，是对远东和世界其他地区和平的严重威胁。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决谴责美国帝国主义这种卑鄙的罪恶的阴谋活动。
    朝鲜人民对美国帝国主义这种不可饶恕的侵略行动采取了毅然决然的自卫措施，是完全正确的。
    美国帝国主义现在正在掀起疯狂的战争叫嚣，把“普韦布洛号”事件提到联合国去，以图掩盖他们的犯罪行为并为之进行辩护，另一方面又说，他们将大规模动员武装力量采取“报复措施”。
    但是，美国帝国主义不管怎么做，都决不能掩盖他们丑恶的侵略本质，也吓不倒朝鲜人民。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军和全体朝鲜人民已经作好充分准备对付美国帝国主义者的任何挑衅或入侵，如果敌人胆敢进攻，定将给予毁灭性的打击。
    联合国不应重演其被美国帝国主义在它挑起的侵略朝鲜的战争中利用作为工具的可耻历史。联合国讨论美国帝国主义歪曲事实真相的“控诉”完全是非法的。
    保卫祖国的安全和主权不受敌人侵犯，是每一个独立国家的不可侵犯的权利，是任何人不能侵犯的内部事务。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决反对在联合国安理会上讨论美国帝国主义的非法“控诉”，将不承认为掩盖美国帝国主义的侵略而炮制的任何决议，并将宣布决议无效。
    联合国如果想要按照它的宪章和使命采取行动，就必须谴责美国帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的侵略行动，并且采取措施制止它为挑起一场新战争而进行的活动。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民深信，所有社会主义国家、亚洲和非洲的民族独立国家以及全世界珍视和平和正义的各国进步人民，必将密切注视美国帝国主义在朝鲜制造的严重局势，进行坚决的斗争以斩断美国帝国主义的侵略的魔爪，并且表示积极支持和声援朝鲜人民为捍卫民族尊严和国家主权而进行的正义斗争。
