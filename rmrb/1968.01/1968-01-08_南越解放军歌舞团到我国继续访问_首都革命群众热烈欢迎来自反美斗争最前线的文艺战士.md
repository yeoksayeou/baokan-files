The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, led by Nguyen Van Hung, arrived in Beijing by train this noon to continue their friendly visit and performances in our country. The troupe had temporarily left China in July last year.

The Beijing Railway Station was filled with a warm atmosphere of fraternal combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, workers from the capital, cultural workers from the troops, and Red Guards warmly welcomed the Vietnamese comrades from the frontline of the anti-American struggle. They held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, as well as large banners reading "Firmly Support the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against American Aggression for National Salvation" and other slogans. When the train entered the station, the welcoming crowd waved copies of the revolutionary treasure, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted slogans such as "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "The Chinese people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership clique!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Amidst the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and cultural workers pinned golden Mao badges on the chests of their Vietnamese comrades. The Vietnamese cultural warriors warmly shook hands and embraced the welcoming crowd.

Those who came to the station to welcome the troupe included Zhou Yiping and other relevant officials, as well as more than 500 revolutionary masses from the capital.

The head of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Van Quang, the acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Embassy in China, Le Chung Chi, and the military attaché of the embassy, Colonel Chen Wenpeng, also came to the station to welcome the troupe.
