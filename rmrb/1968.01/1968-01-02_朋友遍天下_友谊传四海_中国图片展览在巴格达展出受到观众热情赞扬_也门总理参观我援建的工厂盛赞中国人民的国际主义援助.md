China's photo exhibition in Baghdad closes after attracting thousands of Iraqi viewers

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese photo exhibition in Baghdad closed successfully on the evening of December 30, 1967, after being on display for eight days. The exhibition attracted thousands of Iraqi viewers. The photos on display reflected the glorious achievements of the Chinese people's socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

	In the exhibition hall, an Iraqi friend took a photo in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Iraqi people. Chairman Mao Zedong has inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a higher stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought." He said that Mao Zedong Thought points out the only correct path to socialism and communism for all the people of the world.

	Many viewers wrote in the guestbook expressing their common wish: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	The Iraqi viewers were most interested in the photos of Chairman Mao receiving workers, peasants, Red Guards, and other revolutionary people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many viewers stood in front of these photos, reluctant to leave. An Iraqi worker repeatedly said, "Chairman Mao is truly great! Chairman Mao is truly great!" An Iraqi driver said, "Chairman Mao is one with the masses. How happy the Chinese workers and peasants are!"

	In the guestbook, Iraqi viewers enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They said that exposing and removing the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party is a great contribution to the international proletariat.

	Muhammad Mustafa Abdulrahman, a responsible person from the Palestinian Trade Union in Baghdad, said after visiting the exhibition: "The Chinese people have achieved great successes in industry, agriculture, and the cultural revolution. All these achievements should be attributed to the correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought."

Yemen's Prime Minister visits Chinese-aided factory, praises China's internationalist aid

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Yemeni Prime Minister Hassan Amri visited the Sana'a Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, which was built with Chinese aid, on December 27, 1967. He expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their selfless aid to the Yemeni people.

	Accompanied by a representative of Chinese experts, Amri carefully inspected various workshops and products. This modern textile printing and dyeing complex, built with aid from the Chinese government, includes three parts: ginning, weaving, and printing and dyeing, as well as power and water supply facilities. The factory was handed over to the Yemeni side for production in September 1967.

	Amri said after the visit: "This factory is very good, excellent." During the visit, Amri repeatedly shook hands warmly with the Chinese experts, highly praising their work. He said, "The Chinese people are brave and noble people. The Chinese experts wholeheartedly train Yemeni workers, enabling Yemeni workers to master the technology."

	He also said, "I am proud of the friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China. I firmly believe that the Yemeni people are an invincible people. No force can stop the Yemeni people from advancing."

Tanzania newspaper praises China-Yemen friendship

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the organ of the Tanganyika African National Union, the *Uhuru* newspaper (in Swahili), recently published an editorial saying that China's help in building the Tanzania-Zambia Railway is "a symbol of everlasting friendship among the three countries."

	The editorial said that the news of China's aid in building the TZR made imperialists and their lackeys worried. As soon as the railway construction agreement was signed, the imperialists and their newspapers asked how many Chinese people would come to participate in the railway construction.

	The editorial said: "The Chinese are our friends. They respect us, and we respect them."

    也门总理参观我援建的工厂盛赞中国人民的国际主义援助
    坦桑报纸就我援建坦—赞铁路祝愿中坦人民友谊万古长青
    据新华社巴格达电  中国图片展览在展出八天后，去年十二月三十日晚在巴格达胜利闭幕。这个展览会吸引了数以千计的伊拉克观众。展出图片反映了在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民的社会主义革命、社会主义建设和史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就。
    在展览厅里，一位伊拉克朋友在毛主席像前拍了照之后，对新华社记者说：“毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是伊拉克人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东主席继承和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个更高的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。”他说，毛泽东思想给全世界人民指出了通向社会主义和共产主义的唯一正确的道路。
    不少观众在留言簿上写下了他们的共同祝愿：“毛主席万岁！”
    伊拉克观众最感兴趣的是，毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中接见工人、农民、红卫兵和其他革命人民的图片。许多观众站在这些图片面前，留恋不舍。一个伊拉克工人连声说：“毛主席真伟大！毛主席真伟大！”一个伊拉克司机说：“毛主席和群众打成一片。中国工农群众多么幸福啊！”
    留言簿上，伊拉克观众热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们说，把中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来，并清除出去，这是对国际无产阶级的伟大贡献。
    在巴格达的巴勒斯坦工会负责人穆斯塔法·阿卜杜拉·穆勒希姆看了展览会后对新华社记者说：“中国人民在工农业和文化革命方面取得了伟大的成就。这一切成就应该归功于伟大领袖毛泽东主席的正确领导，归功于光焰无际的毛泽东思想。”
    新华社萨那电　也门总理哈桑·阿姆里去年十二月二十七日参观了中国援助也门建设的萨那棉纺织印染厂。他表示感谢中国人民对也门人民的无私的援助。
    阿姆里总理在中国专家代表陪同下仔细地观看了各个车间和产品。这个由中国政府援助也门兴建的现代化的纺织印染联合企业，包括轧花、纺织和印染三个部分，并有发电和供水设备。这座工厂已在一九六七年九月间向也门方面移交生产。
    阿姆里在参观后说：“这座工厂很好，好极了。”在参观过程中，阿姆里一再同中国专家热烈握手，高度赞扬中国专家的工作。他说：“中国人民是英勇高尚的人民。中国专家全心全意地培养也门工人，使也门工人掌握了技术。”
    他还说：“我为也门和中国两国人民的友谊感到骄傲。我坚信也门人民是不可战胜的人民。没有任何力量能够阻挡也门人民前进。”
    据新华社讯　坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟机关报《自由日报》（斯瓦希利语）最近发表社论说，中国帮助修建坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁路“是我们三国之间万古长青的友谊的象征”。
    社论说，中国援建坦—赞铁路的消息使帝国主义者及其走狗感到烦恼。铁路建设协定刚签订，帝国主义者及其报刊就问有多少中国人前来参加铁路建设。
    社论说：“中国人是我们的朋友。他们尊重我们，我们也尊重他们。”
