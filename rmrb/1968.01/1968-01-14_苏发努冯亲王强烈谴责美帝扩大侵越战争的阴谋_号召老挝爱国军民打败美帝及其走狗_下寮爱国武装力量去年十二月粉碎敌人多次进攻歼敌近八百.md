Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, strongly condemned the US imperialist plot to expand the war in Vietnam. He called on the Lao patriotic military and people to defeat the US imperialists and their lackeys. The patriotic armed forces in southern Laos annihilated nearly 800 enemy troops in December last year while repelling multiple enemy attacks.

KANGO, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee, said in a speech at a meeting celebrating the 12th anniversary of the Lao Patriotic Front: "The more we fight, the stronger we become, and the greater our victories will be." He called on the Lao patriotic military and people to launch more ferocious attacks on the enemy and to defeat the US aggressors and their lackeys under any circumstances.

Vice Chairman Sithon Kommadam of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee and other central committee members also attended the meeting.

In his speech, Prince Souphanouvong first reviewed the victories achieved by the Lao patriotic armed forces and people in the past few years, especially in 1967. He pointed out that these victories laid a solid foundation for achieving greater and more decisive victories.

Prince Souphanouvong strongly condemned the increased aggression by the US aggressors and their lackeys against Laos. He said that the US aggressors, in order to turn Laos into a new type of American colony and military base, are waging "special warfare" in Laos, encroaching on the liberated areas, and dispatching aircraft, including B-52 bombers, to indiscriminately bomb Lao villages. At the same time, they are threatening to enter Lao and Cambodian territory for "pursuit," plotting to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina peninsula. Prince Souphanouvong emphasized, "However, the victorious Lao people will never allow the plots of the US and its lackeys to succeed."

At the meeting, representatives from various mass organizations and the People's Liberation Army of Laos spoke, expressing their determination to achieve great victories in 1968 under the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee.

KANGO, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio Station: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee, sent a telegram on Jan. 6 to the patriotic military and people of Xaisomboun Province, warmly praising them for their new achievements in repelling enemy encroachments on the liberated areas of Xaisomboun Province on Dec. 29 and 30 last year and Jan. 4 this year, annihilating nearly 70 enemy troops.

The telegram pointed out that at present, US imperialism and its lackeys in Laos are frantically intensifying the war of aggression, attempting to reverse their increasingly heavy defeats in various parts of Laos.

The telegram called on the military and people of Xaisomboun Province to further unite closely, advance victoriously, overcome all difficulties, and annihilate more enemies.

KANGO, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic armed forces in southern Laos repelled multiple enemy attacks on the liberated areas in December last year, annihilating nearly 800 enemy troops and recapturing many areas that had been seized by the enemy in early 1967.

Among the annihilated enemy troops were four US "advisors" and one Thai captain. A Filipino military personnel was also captured.

In these battles, the patriotic armed forces also destroyed 22 enemy vehicles, a radar station, and a power station, set fire to three ammunition depots and an oil depot storing large amounts of military supplies, blew up two bridges, cut off many important transportation lines, and seized a large amount of military supplies. Under the protection of the patriotic armed forces, thousands of people imprisoned in "concentration camps" were freed and returned to their homes.

KANGO, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency: The patriotic military and people of Savannakhet Province gave a heavy blow to the invading US air pirates on Nov. 8 last year, shooting down five US helicopters.

The report said that on Nov. 8, US imperialism and its lackeys dispatched multiple batches of helicopters, attempting to air-drop spies and paramilitary forces into a certain area in the liberated zone of Savannakhet Province. The well-prepared patriotic military and people of Savannakhet Province immediately launched a counterattack, shooting down five enemy aircraft and annihilating a batch of bandits and paramilitary forces. Thus, so far, the patriotic military and people of Laos have shot down a total of 727 US pirate aircraft.

According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic military and people of Laos shot down another five US pirate aircraft. On Dec. 11 last year, the patriotic military and people of the Xieng Khouang Province's Lakhone area shot down one US helicopter. On Nov. 7 and 28 last year, the patriotic military and people of Xam Neua Province shot down two US aircraft in succession. (with a picture)

    苏发努冯亲王强烈谴责美国侵略者及其走狗加紧对老挝的侵略。他说，美国侵略者为了把老挝变成一个美国的新型殖民地和军事基地，在老挝推行“特种战争”，对解放区进行蚕食，派遣包括B—52型轰炸机在内的飞机对老挝村庄进行狂轰滥炸。与此同时，他们还叫嚣要进入老挝和柬埔寨领土进行“追击”，阴谋把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。苏发努冯亲王强调指出，“但是，已经取得胜利的老挝人民是决不容许美国及其走狗的阴谋活动得逞的。”
    在会上，老挝各群众组织和人民解放军的代表纷纷发言，表示在老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的英明领导下，决心夺取一九六八年的伟大胜利。

    电报指出，目前，美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗正在疯狂地加强侵略战争，妄图挽救它们在老挝各地遭到的日益惨重的失败。
    电报号召会晒省军民进一步紧密团结，乘胜前进，克服一切困难，消灭更多的敌人。
    新华社康开十二日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝下寮的爱国武装力量，去年十二月粉碎了敌军对解放区发动的多次进攻，歼灭敌人近八百名，并且夺回了一九六七年初被敌人抢占的许多地区。
    在被歼灭的敌人中有四名美国“顾问”和一名泰国上尉。还有一名菲律宾军事人员被俘。
    在这些战斗中，爱国武装力量还摧毁了敌人二十二辆军车、一个雷达站和一个发电站，放火烧毁了三座存放大量军用物资的军火库和一座汽油库，炸毁了两座桥梁，切断了许多重要交通线，并且缴获大批军用物资。在爱国武装力量的营救下，被关在“集中”营里的数以千计的人民得到解放，回到了自己的家园。
    新华社康开十二日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝沙湾拿吉省爱国军民去年十一月八日给予入侵的美国空中强盗迎头痛击，共击落美国直升飞机五架。
    报道说，十一月八日，美帝国主义及其走狗出动多批直升飞机，企图把间谍和别动队空投到沙湾拿吉省解放区某地。严阵以待的沙湾拿吉省爱国军民当即英勇反击，一举击落敌机五架，消灭土匪和别动队一批。这样，到目前为止，老挝爱国军民共击落美国强盗飞机七百二十七架。
    据新华社康开十二日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国军民又击落入侵的美国强盗飞机五架。去年十二月十一日，沙拉湾省寮岸地区的爱国军民击落美国直升飞机一架。去年十一月七日和二十八日甘蒙省爱国军民先后击落美国飞机两架。（附图片）
