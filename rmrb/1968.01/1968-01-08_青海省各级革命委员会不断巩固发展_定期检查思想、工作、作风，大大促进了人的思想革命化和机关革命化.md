Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai Province is in an unprecedentedly good situation, getting better and better. The revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs—Revolutionary Committees—at all levels in the province are continuously strengthening and developing. In most of the cities, prefectures, counties, or units equivalent to county level, the majority of cadres have come forward to participate in the revolution.

Recently, the provincial capital Xining, the source of the Yangtze River—Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the prefecture at the foot of the Qilian Mountains—Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the prefecture by Qinghai Lake—Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the prefecture by the Yellow River—Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Mutu Tu Autonomous County, among seventeen counties, have successively established Revolutionary Committees. Currently, the province has 207 units that have established Revolutionary Committees. Among these, 104 are at the city, prefecture, county, or equivalent to county level, and 103 are at the commune or equivalent to commune level.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To correctly handle cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's own unit. This issue must be resolved." The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction firmly act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary masses adopt a serious, enthusiastic, and active attitude to help cadres who have made mistakes, believing that the majority of cadres are revolutionary, and welcoming every small progress made by cadres. Revolutionary cadres also actively and voluntarily struggle against their selfishness, go to the places where they have the most criticism from the masses to check their mistakes, and go to the production frontline to labor and temper themselves, transforming their worldview. Currently, the majority of cadres at the city, prefecture, county, or equivalent to county level have come forward, and the revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs are continuously strengthening and developing.

Once the Revolutionary Committees at various levels in Qinghai Province are established, they place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. Many units' Revolutionary Committees, with "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, regularly hold democratic criticism meetings and life meetings, using Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the "self" in their minds, checking their thoughts, work, and style, placing themselves under the supervision of the broad masses and collective leadership. Therefore, the thought revolutionization of individuals and the revolutionization of organs have been greatly promoted.

Members of the Revolutionary Committees pay great attention to maintaining broad, regular, and close contact with the revolutionary masses, discussing matters with the masses, humbly listening to the masses' criticism and suggestions, continuously improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and strengthening unity between superiors and subordinates. They follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "being both an official and a common person," insisting on participating in production labor for those who were originally cadres, and generally not leaving their original production posts for those who were originally workers and peasants.

Many units' Revolutionary Committees' new and old cadres, following Chairman Mao's instructions, help and cherish each other, learning from each other's strengths and making up for their own weaknesses. The new and old cadres in the Revolutionary Committees at various levels, in their joint work, trust and respect each other more, establishing deep class feelings, and further consolidating the unity of the leadership core.

    青海省各级革命委员会不断巩固发展
    定期检查思想、工作、作风，大大促进了人的思想革命化和机关革命化
    据新华社西宁电　在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，青海省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。全省各级革命三结合临时权力机构——革命委员会不断巩固发展，市、州、县或相当于县级的单位，多数干部已经站出来革命。
    最近，青海省会西宁市，长江源头的玉树藏族自治州，祁连山麓的海北藏族自治州，青海湖畔的海南藏族自治州，黄河之滨的黄南藏族自治州，以及互助土族自治县等十七个县，先后成立了革命委员会。目前，全省已有二百零七个单位成立了革命委员会。其中，市、州、县或相当于县级以上的单位占一百零四个，公社或相当于公社一级的单位占一百零三个。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”青海省革命委员会和“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班。革命群众对犯有错误的干部，采取严肃、热情、积极的态度给予帮助，相信干部的大多数是要革命的，欢迎干部每一个微小的进步。广大革命干部也积极主动地斗私，到对自己意见最多的群众中去检查错误，到生产第一线去劳动锻炼，改造世界观。目前，全省市、州、县或相当于县级以上单位的多数干部站出来了，革命三结合的临时权力机构不断巩固和发展。
    青海省各级革命委员会一成立，就把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。很多单位的革命委员会以“斗私，批修”为纲，定期召开民主讲评会和生活会，用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，检查思想、检查工作、检查作风，把自己置于广大群众和集体领导的监督之下。因此，大大促进了人的思想革命化和机关革命化。
    革命委员会的成员，十分注意同广大革命群众保持广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，遇事同群众商量，虚心听取群众的批评和建议，不断改善干部和群众的关系，增强上下级团结。他们遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，原来是干部的坚持参加生产劳动，原来是工人、农民的一般不脱离原来的生产岗位。
    许多单位革命委员会的新老干部，遵照毛主席的教导，互相帮助，互相爱护，学别人之长，补自己之短。各级革命委员会中的新老干部在共同工作中，更加互相信赖，互相尊重，建立了深厚的阶级感情，更加巩固了领导核心的团结。
