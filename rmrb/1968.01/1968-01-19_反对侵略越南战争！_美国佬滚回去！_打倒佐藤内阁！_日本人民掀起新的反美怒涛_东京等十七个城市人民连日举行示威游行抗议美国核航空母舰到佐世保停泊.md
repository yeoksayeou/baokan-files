"Oppose the invasion of Vietnam War!"
"Yankees go home!"
"Overthrow the Sato Cabinet!"

The Japanese people are launching a new wave of anti-American sentiment. In Tokyo and seventeen other cities, people have been holding rallies and protests against the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" in Sasebo.

Xinhua News Agency, January 18th - According to the Oriental News Agency: The brave Japanese people are launching a new patriotic anti-American movement. In the past few days, people in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and seventeen other cities have held meetings and marches, firmly opposing the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" in Sasebo Port, and opposing the new crimes of the Sato government in aiding the U.S. imperialists in expanding the Vietnam War.

On the evening of the 17th, over ten thousand young workers and students from Tokyo and its surrounding areas held a rally in Hibiya Park and marched in protest against the docking of the "Enterprise" in Sasebo Port. They also strongly protested against the Sato reactionary government's bloody suppression of anti-American patriotic students. The venue was filled with red flags, and the flags read: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Stop the 'Enterprise' from docking with force!"

At the meeting, representatives from workers, students, and the alliance against the expansion of the Sunagawa Base and the alliance against the construction of the New Tokyo International Airport in Chiba County all spoke, unanimously strongly opposing U.S. imperialism's expansion of the Vietnam War and strongly condemning the Sato reactionary government's suppression of the people's patriotic and just struggle. All attendees held hands, sang "The Internationale," and continuously chanted: "We will resolutely fight!" "Resolutely stop the 'Enterprise' from docking!" "Stand together with the Vietnamese people to fight!" "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" After the meeting, the attendees marched in a grand protest in front of the U.S. Embassy and the Japanese Parliament.

The pro-American and traitorous Sato reactionary government dispatched a large number of police and armored vehicles to suppress the protesters. The police swung batons at the demonstrators and illegally arrested several students. However, the students bravely persisted in their struggle.

In Sasebo, on the morning of the 17th, eight hundred university students from all over the country who had rushed to Sasebo held a protest march at the U.S. naval base. The Sato reactionary government had mobilized a large number of fully armed police from twenty-two prefectures to Sasebo, deploying armored vehicles and water cannons on the bridge leading to the U.S. naval base, setting up two layers of barbed wire barriers, attempting to block the anti-American march. The students bravely charged the barriers and threw stones at the police. Despite the large number of tear gas bombs fired by the police, they fought tenaciously for two hours and finally broke through the barriers. The frightened Sato government then dispatched over two thousand armed police to surround the students, savagely beating many patriotic students and arresting twenty-seven of them.

The Sato government's fascist actions further ignited the Japanese people's determination to oppose the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise." They marched in protest in batches in the streets of Sasebo.

On the evening of the 17th, another eight hundred young workers and students held a protest meeting. After the meeting, they marched in protest at the U.S. naval base.

The participants raised their arms and shouted: "No to the 'Enterprise'!" "Yankees go home!" "Abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" "Oppose the invasion of Vietnam War!" "Overthrow the Sato Cabinet!"

The protesters, despite the savage beatings by the thousands of armed police guarding the U.S. base, marched forward with high spirits around the U.S. base.

In Kyoto, on the evening of the 17th, five hundred young students and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) held a protest march in the city.

In Osaka, on the evening of the 16th, seven organizations, including the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Osaka Prefecture General Branch and the Japan International Trade Promotion Association Kansai General Branch, held a meeting to protest the docking of the "Enterprise" in Sasebo. The meeting submitted a protest letter to the U.S. Consulate and the Sato government.

Workers, students, and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Kyoto Prefecture General Branch and the Mao Zedong Thought Research Society of Doshisha University from various parts of the Kansai region held a protest meeting in front of the city hall on the afternoon of the 15th. After the meeting, the attendees marched in the city and protested in front of the U.S. Consulate.

According to the Xinhua News Agency, January 16th - According to the Oriental News Agency, the Japanese people, in order to oppose the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" scheduled to dock in Sasebo on the 18th, are waging a heroic struggle. The Sato pro-American traitor government has carried out savage suppression against the people's struggle.

In order to expand the Vietnam War, U.S. imperialism decided to send the nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and two nuclear cruisers to Japan's Sasebo Port for a five-day stop, and then proceed to South Vietnam. The Sato traitor government decided at a cabinet meeting in November last year to agree to the use of these U.S. nuclear vessels in Japan's Sasebo Port and to provide them with "all conveniences," including water, food, and daily necessities. This is another major crime of the Sato government in further turning Japan into a U.S. nuclear base and serving the U.S. Vietnam War.

    日本人民掀起新的反美怒涛
    东京等十七个城市人民连日举行示威游行抗议美国核航空母舰到佐世保停泊
    新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：英勇的日本人民正在掀起一场新的反美爱国运动。东京、大阪、京都等十七个城市的人民连日来举行大会和游行，坚决反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”到佐世保港停泊，反对佐藤卖国政府帮助美帝扩大侵越战争的新罪行。
    十七日晚上，东京和东京附近地区的青年工人和学生一万多人，在日比谷公园举行大会，并举行了示威游行，反对“企业号”到佐世保港停泊，并且强烈抗议佐藤反动政府血腥镇压反美爱国学生。会场上，红旗如林，红旗上写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“用实力阻止‘企业号’停泊！”
    会上，工人、学生代表以及反对扩张砂川基地同盟和千叶县三里塚反对建设国际机场同盟的代表分别讲话，一致强烈反对美帝国主义扩大侵越战争，强烈谴责佐藤反动政府镇压人民的爱国正义斗争。全体与会者手挽着手，高唱《国际歌》，并且不断高呼：“我们要坚决地斗争！”“坚决阻止‘企业号’停泊！”“和越南人民团结起来共同斗争！”“粉碎日美安全条约！”会后，与会者到美国大使馆和日本国会前面举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    亲美卖国的佐藤反动政府，出动大批警察和装甲车，镇压游行群众，警察挥舞棍棒袭击示威群众，并非法逮捕数名学生。但是，学生们勇敢地坚持斗争。
    在佐世保，十七日上午从全国各地赶到佐世保的八百名大学生，曾经到美国海军基地举行示威游行。佐藤反动政府从二十二个府县调集到佐世保的大批全副武装警察，在通往美国海军基地的桥上排列了装甲车和喷水车，设下两重铁丝网路障，企图阻止反美游行队伍。学生们勇敢地向路障冲击，并且向警察猛烈投掷石头。他们面对着警察发射的大量催泪弹，顽强地奋斗了两小时之久，终于成功地冲破了路障。吓破了胆的佐藤政府，又出动了二千多名武装警察包围了学生，疯狂地打伤许多爱国学生，并且逮捕了二十七名学生。
    佐藤政府这种法西斯行为进一步激发了日本人民反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”停泊的斗志。他们一批又一批地在佐世保市内进行示威游行。
    十七日晚上，又有八百名青年工人和学生举行了抗议集会。会后，他们到美国海军基地举行了示威游行。
    参加游行的人们振臂高呼：“‘企业号’不许来！”“美国佬滚回去！”“废除日美安全条约！”“反对侵略越南战争！”“打倒佐藤内阁！”
    参加游行的人不顾守卫美军基地的数千名武装警察的野蛮殴打，在美军基地周围斗志昂扬地挺进。
    在京都，十七日晚上，五百名青年学生和日中友好协会（正统）会员在市内举行了示威游行。
    在大阪，日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部、日本国际贸易促进协会关西总部等七个团体十六日晚上举行了抗议“企业号”到佐世保停泊的集会。大会向美国领事馆和佐藤政府递交了抗议书。
    关西各地的工人、学生和日中友好协会
  （正统）京都府总部会员和同志社大学毛泽东思想研究会会员等，十五日下午在市政府前举行了抗议集会。会后，与会者在市内游行，并到美国领事馆前示威。
    据新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本人民为了反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”预定十八日停泊佐世保港口，正在开展着英勇的斗争。佐藤亲美卖国政府对日本人民的斗争进行了野蛮的镇压。
    美帝国主义为了扩大侵越战争，决定派遣核航空母舰“企业号”和两艘核巡洋舰到日本的佐世保港停泊五天，然后开往南越。佐藤卖国政府在去年十一月就在内阁会议上决定同意美国这些核舰艇使用日本佐世保港，并为它们“提供”补给水、粮食和日用品等“一切方便”。这是佐藤政府进一步把日本变成美国核基地，为美国侵越战争效劳的又一重大罪行。
