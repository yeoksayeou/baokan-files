The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing's Shijingshan Middle School, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, which is responsible for their military training, have consistently focused on studying Chairman Mao's works and implementing his thoughts and latest directives on educational revolution since the resumption of classes and the revolution.

This is the right approach! By focusing on this, they have grasped the essence.

Precisely because they have grasped the essence, they have been able to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination on the basis of revolutionary principles, and prepare both ideologically and organizationally to carry out Chairman Mao's directive to resume classes and make revolution. They have overcome interference from both the "left" and the right, withstood multiple assaults from anarchist tendencies both inside and outside the school, and have consistently adhered to the correct direction of resuming classes and making revolution. They have taken a significant step forward in dismantling the bourgeois educational system and establishing a proletarian educational system.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process with two or more contradictions, we must use all our strength to find its principal contradiction. Once we grasp this principal contradiction, all problems will be solved."

Currently, schools face numerous tasks and heavy responsibilities. There are countless things to do, and everything seems important. What should be the main focus? Based on the experience of Shijingshan Middle School and other schools, the main focus should be on implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives and his thoughts on educational revolution. By grasping this essence, other problems will be solved. If we do not grasp the essence but get bogged down in trivial matters, treating each symptom separately, we will lose our direction and stray from the path.

All revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards must, with deep class feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, consult Chairman Mao's works on every matter. We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest directives, combining learning with practice; we must repeatedly understand and resolutely carry out his instructions, regularly check our progress, and summarize our experiences. In resuming classes and making revolution, we must have a thorough revolutionary spirit and unyielding perseverance, as well as a practical work style and scientific attitude. In this way, we can follow the course set by Chairman Mao and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian educational revolution!

     千条万绪抓根本
     本报评论员
    北京市石景山中学的革命师生员工，在担任军训任务的人民解放军的支持和帮助下，从复课闹革命以来，始终狠抓对毛主席著作的学习，狠抓对毛主席教育革命思想和最新指示的落实。
    这一条抓得好！抓住了这一条，就抓住了根本。
    正因为抓住了根本，他们就能够紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命原则的基础上，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，为执行毛主席复课闹革命的指示做了思想上和组织上的准备。他们排除了来自“左”的和右的方面的干扰，顶住了校内外的无政府主义思潮的多次冲击，一直坚持了复课闹革命的正确方向。他们在破除资产阶级教育制度、创建无产阶级教育制度方面，迈出了可喜的一步。
    毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    当前，摆在我们各学校面前的工作很多，任务很重。事情千条万绪，这也要抓，那也要抓，主要抓什么呢？根据石景山中学和其他一些学校的经验，主要应当抓对毛主席最新指示的落实，抓对毛主席教育革命思想的落实。抓住了这个根本，其它问题就会迎刃而解。如果我们不抓根本，而是陷在事务堆里，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，那就会迷失方向，走上歧途。
    一切革命的师生和红卫兵小将，必须以对我们伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，遇事向毛主席著作请教。对毛主席的著作和最新指示，一定要活学活用，学用结合；要反复领会，坚决照办，经常检查，及时总结。在复课闹革命中，既要有彻底革命的精神和坚韧不拔的毅力，又要有脚踏实地的工作作风和科学态度。这样，我们就能够沿着毛主席指引的航道，去夺取无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利！
