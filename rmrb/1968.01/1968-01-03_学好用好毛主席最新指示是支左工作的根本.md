As we celebrate the radiant arrival of 1968, we received the joyous news that our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received representatives of our military cadres, local party and government cadres, revolutionary masses participating in the study of Mao Zedong Thought in Beijing, and participants in various meetings. Chairman Mao was in high spirits, full of vitality, in excellent health, and brimming with energy. This is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation and the greatest happiness for the people of the world! We wish Chairman Mao a long, long life a thousand, ten thousand times!

The new year of struggle has arrived. We enthusiastically welcome the New Year editorial "Welcoming the Comprehensive Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" published by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. This editorial is a great battle command issued by the proletarian headquarters led by our great leader Chairman Mao to the military and people of the entire nation to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It points out the great strategic goals and five battle tasks for 1968. We must study it seriously, understand it deeply, and carry it out resolutely.

Last June, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions that "we Communist Party members should face the wind and rain and see the world," we went to the Beijing Knitting Factory to carry out the task of supporting the left. Through more than half a year of struggle, we deeply feel that to correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and successfully complete the glorious task of the People's Liberation Army supporting the broad leftist masses, the most fundamental thing is to first study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to quickly and accurately convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses, ensuring that every point is implemented and fully implemented.

Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable major factions." We immediately studied this seriously and regarded it as Chairman Mao's battle command for revolutionary unity. We must not delay for a second in carrying out Chairman Mao's battle command. Together with the revolutionary mass organizations in the factory, we, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, posted Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the workshops, offices, canteens, and dormitories, and propagated them everywhere. Chairman Mao's great battle command quickly became the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses in the Beijing Knitting Factory. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they quickly achieved revolutionary unity.

Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." We immediately conducted extensive propaganda and, based on the active thoughts of the revolutionary masses, erroneous cadres, and their families, focused on ideological and political work. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, we studied Chairman Mao's instructions, helping them understand the great significance of correctly handling cadres. For erroneous cadres, we organized them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, encouraging them to go to the masses, check their mistakes, and listen to criticism; to reminisce about hardships and sweetness with the masses, to criticize China's Khrushchev together, to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line together, and to raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. For the families of cadres, we repeatedly propagated the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, encouraging them to help their relatives correctly handle the mass movement. In the end, the vast majority of revolutionary cadres in the factory stood up, creating conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the country achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a new battle command: to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. We immediately and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great battle command, conducted serious study, widely solicited opinions from the revolutionary masses in the entire factory about the leftist support personnel, listened to criticisms from all sides, and took the lead in fighting selfishness.

We actively helped the proletarian revolutionary factions in the factory to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fiercely fought against the "self," swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened party spirit, further consolidated the revolutionary great unity in thought and organization, and quickly achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Every bit of achievement we have made in supporting the left is entirely due to our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the new year, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more consciously put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, combining study with application, seeing immediate results. Unlimited love for Chairman Mao and resolutely acting according to Mao Zedong Thought is the great principle of revolutionary soldiers. For Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must act immediately, follow closely, carry out every word, implement every point, and fully implement them.

We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching that "humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," be humble and cautious, learn from the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Comrade Li Wenzhong, raise the revolutionization of our thoughts to a new level, do the work of supporting the left even better, and make new contributions to the people in the great struggle to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    学好用好毛主席最新指示是支左工作的根本
    八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左指战员
    在欢庆光辉灿烂的一九六八年到来的时候，传来了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，接见正在北京参加毛泽东思想学习班学习的我军干部、各地党政干部和革命群众的代表，以及参加各种会议的人员的特大喜讯，毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，这是全国人民的最大幸福，这是世界人民的最大幸福！我们千遍万遍地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    新的战斗的一年来到了，我们热烈欢呼《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》的发表。这篇社论，是以伟大领袖毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部向全国军民发出的夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大战斗号令，它向全国军民指出了一九六八年的伟大战略目标和五项战斗任务。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    去年六月，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”的教导，到北京针织总厂执行支左任务。半年多来的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到：要正确执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，胜利完成“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的光荣任务，最最根本的就是首先要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，并且把毛主席的最新指示最迅速地、原原本本地同广大革命群众见面，做到条条落实，全面落实。
    毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们立即认真学习，认为这是毛主席发出的革命大联合的战斗号令。执行毛主席的战斗号令，一秒钟也不能耽误。我们和厂里的革命群众组织一起，用最大的热情，最快的速度，在车间、办公室、食堂、宿舍张贴毛主席的这一最新指示，到处宣传毛主席的这一最新指示。毛主席这一伟大战斗号令，迅速变成了北京针织总厂广大革命群众的自觉行动，他们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，很快实现了革命的大联合。
    毛主席发出最新指示：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”我们立即大张旗鼓地进行宣传，并且根据革命群众、犯错误的干部及其家属的活思想，抓紧做思想政治工作。我们和广大革命群众一起学习毛主席这一指示，帮助他们认清正确对待干部的重大意义。对犯错误的干部，我们组织他们活学活用毛主席著作，鼓励他们到群众中去，检查错误，听取批评；和群众一起忆苦思甜，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，一起批判资产阶级反动路线，提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。对干部的家属，我们反复宣传了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，鼓励他们帮助自己的亲人正确对待群众运动。最后，使厂里的绝大多数的革命干部站了出来，为实现革命的三结合创造了条件。
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席又发出了新的战斗号令：要斗私，批修。我们首先雷厉风行地坚决贯彻执行毛主席这一伟大战斗号令，立即进行了认真学习，广泛征求全厂革命群众对支左人员的意见，听取各方面的批评，带头斗私。
    我们积极帮助厂里的无产阶级革命派举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗“私”字，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强党性，进一步从思想上和组织上巩固革命的大联合，很快地实现了革命的三结合。
    我们在支左工作中取得的每一点成绩，完全归功于我们伟大领袖毛主席，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在新的一年里，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更自觉地把活学活用毛主席的最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置，学用结合，立竿见影。无限热爱毛主席，坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，是革命战士的大节。对毛主席的最新指示，我们一定要闻风而动，步步紧跟，句句照办，条条落实，全面落实。
    我们一定牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的伟大教导，谦虚谨慎，向“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志学习，把思想革命化提到一个新的高度，把支左工作做得好上加好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中为人民立新功。
