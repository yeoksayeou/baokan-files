Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the care of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress recently held a performance of revolutionary workers' amateur arts. Several thousand workers from over 200 factories, mines, and enterprises across the city took to the stage, using various art forms to enthusiastically sing praises of the great leader Chairman Mao, propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and celebrate the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the same time, they used art as a weapon to fiercely denounce China's Khrushchev, turning the stage into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

This performance was organized based on the extensive propaganda activities carried out by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in various factories and mines at the grassroots level. The entire performance was oriented towards the grassroots and the masses, bringing art performances that shine with the light of Mao Zedong Thought to the frontlines of class struggle and production struggle. To celebrate the early completion and overfulfillment of the 1967 coal production task by the Jingxi Wood City Gorge Coal Mine, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Power System of the Workers' Congress went to the mine for a visit during the New Year holiday. As soon as they arrived, they performed for the miners, propagating the latest directives. The miners said, "In the past, theater troupes would always perform in the clubhouse, and the performances were all about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. But you came straight to the mine entrance and underground to perform, and the performances were all about revolutionary art. You also labored with us. Truly, you are propagators of Mao Zedong Thought! You brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the voice of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. Watching your performance, we felt the warmth of the red sun, and we are full of energy and warmth! We will work even harder to seize the revolution and promote production!"

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the capital's working class closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings that "our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers," and stand firmly in their own factories and mines. They keep up with the current situation, create and perform actively and enthusiastically, propagating the latest directives. Many propaganda teams, on the evening of the New Year's editorial broadcast, took notes by the radio and created and rehearsed performances propagating the spirit of the New Year's editorial throughout the night. Before and after meetings, and before and after shifts, they performed in the workshops, canteens, and meeting places. With the help of the PLA, Beijing Knitting Factory established Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in every workshop, and every shift has Mao Zedong Thought propagandists. They universally teach and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and poems, and study, recite, and apply the "Three Articles" extensively. The entire factory is full of vitality, presenting a lively new situation.

This performance widely and deeply relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and respected the masses' pioneering spirit, producing many excellent programs such as "The Red Sun Shines on the Knitting Factory," "We Are All Class Brothers," "The Whole Family Are Critics," "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production," and "Li Wenzhong." These programs reflect that under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the working class of the capital is not only the creator of material wealth but also the creator of spiritual wealth; they demonstrate the great power of the working class in occupying the art stage.

Through this performance, the broad masses of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams deeply felt that to run the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams well, one must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works; insist on revolutionary criticism, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line; insist on non-professional status and strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, achieving thought revolutionization, mass organization, and action militarization.

The members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams who participated in the performance expressed that in the future, they will further improve the propaganda level of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, more fully utilize concise and varied art forms, and vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

    热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席
    深入宣传伟大毛泽东思想
    北京市工代会举行革命职工业余文艺汇报演出
    本报讯　在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在北京市革命委员会的关怀下，北京市工代会最近举行革命职工业余文艺汇报演出。全市两百多个厂矿企业的毛泽东思想宣传队的几千名职工登上舞台，运用各种文艺形式，满腔热情地歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利；同时，他们又以文艺为武器，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫，把舞台变成革命大批判的战场。
    这次汇演是全市各厂矿毛泽东思想宣传队深入群众，在基层普遍开展宣传活动的基础上举办的。整个汇演面向基层、面向群众，把闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的文艺节目送到阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线。为了庆贺京西木城涧煤矿提前超额完成一九六七年产煤任务，工代会电力系统毛泽东思想宣传队利用新年休息期间赶去慰问。他们一下车就为矿工同志们演出宣传最新指示的节目。矿工们说：“过去来的剧团剧院，总是在俱乐部演，演的尽是帝王将相、才子佳人；而你们一来就到坑口、井下演出，演的都是革命文艺节目，还和我们一块劳动，真是毛泽东思想宣传员！”“你们送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，送来了毛主席和党中央的声音”，“看了你们的演出，感到了红太阳的温暖，浑身是劲，热乎乎的！我们要更使劲地抓革命，促生产！”
    首都工人阶级的毛泽东思想宣传队，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，遵循毛主席“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”教导，立足于本厂、本矿，紧跟当前形势，自编自演，积极热情地宣传最新指示。许多宣传队在元旦社论广播的当晚，就在收音机旁速记，连夜创作赶排宣传元旦社论精神的节目。在会前会后班前班后，到车间、食堂和会场就地演出。北京针织总厂在解放军的帮助下，每个车间都建立起了毛泽东思想宣传队，每个班组都有毛泽东思想宣传员。普遍教唱毛主席语录歌和毛主席诗词歌，大学大背大用“老三篇”，全厂热气腾腾，出现了一个生动活泼的新局面。
    这次汇演，广泛深入地依靠群众，发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，涌现出许多优秀节目，如《红太阳照亮了针织总厂》、《我们都是阶级兄弟》、《全家都是批判家》、《抓革命，促生产》、《李文忠》等，反映了首都工人阶级在毛主席的英明领导下，他们既是物质财富的创造者，又是精神财富的创造者；显示出工人阶级占领文艺舞台的巨大威力。
    通过这次汇演，广大的毛泽东思想宣传队队员深刻地体会到，要办好毛泽东思想宣传队，必须坚持高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作；坚持革命的大批判，捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线；坚持不脱产和加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，实现思想革命化、组织群众化和行动战斗化。
    参加汇演的毛泽东思想宣传队员们表示，今后要进一步提高毛泽东思想宣传队的宣传水平，更充分地利用短小精悍、多种多样的文艺形式，大力宣传毛泽东思想。
