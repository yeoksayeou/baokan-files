The most important aspect of the excellent situation is that after the broad revolutionary masses have encountered the great leader Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, a fervent tide of earnestly studying and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions has emerged. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, covering all parts of the country. They have become schools for the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and vast battlefields for "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism," significantly raising the ideological awareness of broad revolutionary cadres and the masses. The pace of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination has greatly accelerated.

    形势大好最重要的一点是：伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示同广大革命群众见面以后，出现了一个群众性的认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的最新指示的热潮。毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及全国各地，成为活学活用毛泽东思想的学校，成为“斗私，批修”的广阔战场，有力地提高了广大革命干部和革命群众的思想觉悟。革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐大大加快了。
