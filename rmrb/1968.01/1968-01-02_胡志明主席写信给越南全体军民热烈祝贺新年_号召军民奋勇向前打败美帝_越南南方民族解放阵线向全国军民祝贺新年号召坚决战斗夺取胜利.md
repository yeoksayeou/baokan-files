	The congratulatory letter states: "Since 1965, American imperialism has sent hundreds of thousands of troops to directly invade our southern region and has also launched a destructive war against our northern region. Our people have united as one, resolutely resisting the Americans and saving the nation, achieving many brilliant victories."

	"By the end of 1967, the heroic southern military and civilians have killed, wounded, and disintegrated tens of thousands of American, puppet, and mercenary troops." "The heroic northern military and civilians have shot down more than 2,680 American aggressor aircraft, reducing them to smithereens."

	"This year, the American aggressors are even more passive and more disheveled, and our military and civilians will advance to victory, surely achieving even greater victories."

	In the closing of the letter, Chairman Ho wrote a New Year's poem:

	"Today's spring is brighter than ever,
	The nation rejoices as victory news spreads.
	North and South compete to defeat the Americans,
	We confidently march forward to victory!"

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 1st - According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, at the beginning of the New Year, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam wrote to all Vietnamese military and civilians to warmly congratulate the New Year.

	The letter states that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam wishes the nation's military and civilians greater unity in the New Year, achieving even greater and more comprehensive victories than ever before. The letter points out that the Vietnamese people have already foiled the enemy's every brutal and vicious plot and invasion plan, and the enemy is further falling into an increasingly desperate situation.

	The letter states that the American aggressors are in great defeat. The closer they get to failure, the more frantically they struggle. However, no matter how brutal the force or how cunning the tactics, they cannot stop the Vietnamese people from bravely advancing and achieving a complete victory.

	The letter calls on all Vietnamese military and civilians to be prepared at any time to overcome all difficulties and hardships, fearing no sacrifice, and to resolutely fight and resolutely achieve victory, no matter how long the war lasts.
