The people of Gansu, numbering 13 million, enthusiastically celebrated the glorious birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, warmly hailing this new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The people of the entire province, with hearts filled with boundless excitement, expressed their determination to further comprehensively implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and strive for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The joyous news of the birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee quickly spread throughout the province. Cities and countryside were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and everywhere was a scene of jubilation. In places where the Red Army once passed, such as Min Mountains, La Zi Kou, and Ha Da Pu, and in places where the Red Army achieved victory, such as Hui Ning, as well as in various parts of the province, the people gathered to celebrate the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, with deep feelings of love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, sang "The East is Red" over and over again and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" On the night of the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses in Lanzhou gathered in the square in front of the provincial revolutionary committee, celebrating with the members of the committee until late into the night.

The members of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the entire province, while celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, deeply felt that "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Xian Henghan, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said at the first meeting held after the establishment of the committee, "After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, there are countless tasks, but the most fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, summarize experiences, inspect work, formulate measures, and especially carry out the thought revolutionization of the leading organs and members, leading all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations in the province, guiding the broad revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and swiftly launch a high tide of earnest study and comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the province." The workers' congress, peasants' congress, red guards' congresses of higher education institutions and middle schools, as well as many grassroots units' revolutionary committees, decided during the celebration of the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions at the forefront of all work, as the foundation of all work, and to turn their departments and units into red-hot schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many revolutionary masses in factories, schools, and government agencies across Gansu pointed out during the celebration of the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the biggest obstacle to following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and the biggest obstacle to comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a "people's war," resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, carry out thorough criticism and reform, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The three factions of Lanzhou University, which had long been at odds, established revolutionary committees in six departments and two affiliated factories immediately after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions following the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, laying a solid foundation for the establishment of the school's revolutionary committee.

Before and after the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all fronts in the province launched a wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production and work, welcoming and celebrating the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee. The revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou New China Printing Factory completed their honorable task of printing "Quotations from Chairman Mao" for January with the greatest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the best quality ahead of schedule. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture expressed their determination to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Gansu, Wang Feng; while focusing on the revolution, they actively prepared for spring plowing and production, striving for greater development in agricultural production this year. Revolutionary teachers and students in colleges and universities resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, returning to classes and making revolution.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Lanzhou-based People's Liberation Army, who had achieved great feats in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most enthusiastically hailed the victorious birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They decided to hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and in the "three supports, two militaries," and all other work, closely follow the great commander Chairman Mao, implement all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and create new feats for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The joyous news of the birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee spread to the various units of the Lanzhou region, from the camps to the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," from the headquarters to the companies, everywhere was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and triumphant songs. The cadres and soldiers held up giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, and with red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, held celebration meetings and parades, shouting with joy: "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is victorious for ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The news reached the units fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," and the cadres and soldiers of these units held discussions with the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, seriously reviewing and summarizing their work over the past year. They decided to make every effort, to the highest standards, to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to do an even better job in the "three supports, two militaries."

During the enthusiastic celebration of the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, many units launched a broader, deeper, and more solid wave of studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. To turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the soul of the broad revolutionary masses, the 8083 Unit sent out more than 40 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, braving the cold wind and treading on the ice and snow, going deep into Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and other places, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses, spreading and popularizing Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers of the 8110 Unit, who had achieved outstanding results in supporting the left and supporting agriculture, summarized their experiences in supporting the left and supporting agriculture. They actively and enthusiastically helped the broad poor and lower-middle peasants set up study classes, carry out thorough criticism, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the countryside, allowing the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to occupy every position in the countryside.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Lanzhou-based units, while celebrating the victorious birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, firmly remembered the great teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat, they will make their last struggles," and "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." They deeply understood that the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee is only the first step of the long march, and there is still a longer, more winding, and more arduous road ahead. "The iron gates of the pass are like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it." The cadres and soldiers firmly expressed their determination to increase their revolutionary vigilance a thousandfold, to prevent all sabotage activities by the class enemy, to resolutely defend the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, to seize the revolution, to promote production and work, to promote preparedness for war, to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly in the northwest of the motherland!
