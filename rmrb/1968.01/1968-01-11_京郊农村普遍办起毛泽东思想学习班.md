The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is being widely propagated, popularized, and applied in Beijing's suburban villages. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established throughout the suburbs. Not only are they organized at the county and commune levels, but also at the production brigade and production team levels, and even by the masses. Many production teams have ensured that every household and individual participates in the study classes. The broad masses of commune members and grassroots cadres regard the study classes as a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and as a vast battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. This has significantly raised their ideological awareness and powerfully promoted the Cultural Revolution and the development of all work.

The widespread establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes has pushed the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide in the suburbs, making the invincible Mao Zedong Thought widely propagated, popularized, and applied. Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his latest directives have become household words, deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Not only can the youth recite them, but many illiterate old poor peasants and women can also recite several passages. With the widespread propagation and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary and production situation in Beijing's suburban villages is getting better and better. Out of the fourteen counties and districts in the suburbs, twelve have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory small groups; a solid winter production upsurge is underway, and the promising signs of a new agricultural leap forward are emerging.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in Beijing's suburban villages have three basic characteristics:

First, they fully trust and rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. Many communes and production brigades in the suburbs have, in organizing study classes, implemented the mass line in terms of organization, leadership, learning content, and learning methods, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. The cadres organizing the study classes are also students, learning together with everyone. During the learning process, the masses raise questions, discuss them in light of Chairman Mao's directives, and find answers themselves. For example, when conducting ideological education, the brigade cadres had differing views on the situation. They adopted a method of presenting (the overall situation of the country and the locality), discussing (the origins of the good situation), comparing (with Chairman Mao's latest directives), debating (on different views), and summarizing and raising awareness to resolve the issue, achieving good results. Many cadres said, "When we truly understand it, we remember it, and when we return, we can convey it without distortion." When the study class in Shandongzhuang Commune, Pinggu County, was established, some participating cadres had an insufficient understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution and could not correctly handle the mass movement or correctly handle themselves. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee of this commune organized everyone to repeatedly and seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his latest directives. These cadres raised their class consciousness and quickly changed their attitudes. The more they studied, the deeper their feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao became, and the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm grew.

Second, they consistently adhere to positive education. Various places have, relying on the masses, created many effective positive education methods. The main ones are: (1) Combining learning with revolutionary criticism and repudiation, directing the struggle at China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Peng Zhen and their local agents. Each study class period allocates a certain amount of time to purposefully carry out criticism and repudiation activities, set up criticism columns, and hold various criticism meetings. (2) Emphasizing class education. Through class education, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have become more loyal and loving towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The study classes held in various places have extensively carried out the "Three Remembrances and Three Comparisons" activities, namely: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the crimes of the capitalist roadline and comparing it with the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution; remembering the Party's cultivation and education of oneself and comparing one's contributions to the Party and the people. (3) Emphasizing typical examples and holding "experience-sharing meetings," letting typical examples serve as teachers and allowing the masses to educate themselves. During class education, old poor peasants are invited to share their family histories. Some mountainous communes even invite old cadres who fought bravely against the enemy during the anti-Japanese war to share their village histories. When educating cadres, revolutionary cadres who have come forward are invited to share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest directives, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, correctly handling relations with the masses, and correctly handling themselves.

Third, they closely combine with current realities, with flexible and varied forms. Each study class period takes Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his latest directives as the guideline, with a central theme for each period, closely combining with current realities, and addressing one or two important issues facing cadres and the masses. For example, the first few study class periods focused on solving some ideological problems of grassroots cadres, resolving the opposing sentiments of the leaders of the two factions of mass organizations, encouraging a large number of revolutionary cadres to come forward, significantly consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and promoting the three-in-one combination of revolution. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the study classes focused on solving the relationship between new and old cadres and the issue of the thought revolutionization of cadres. Many production teams' study classes studied "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in the Chinese Countryside," preparing the ideological foundation for a deeper revolutionary criticism and repudiation this winter. The organizational forms of the study classes are flexible and varied, creating conditions for more people to participate in learning. Some communes and production brigades also pay attention to combining short-term study classes with the regular study of Chairman Mao's works, making the study of Chairman Mao's works more regular and institutionalized.

### 京郊农村普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的大宣传大普及大运用
    京郊农村普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班
    学习班的三个基本特点是：充分相信和依靠广大贫下中农和革命干部；自始至终坚持正面教育；密切结合当前实际，形式灵活多样
    新华社十日讯  北京郊区农村广大贫下中农和革命干部热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班。目前，毛泽东思想学习班已遍及郊区农村。不但县、社办，大队、生产队也办，群众也办。许多生产队已做到户户人人参加学习班。广大社员和基层干部把学习班当作活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，当作斗私批修的广阔战场，有力地提高了思想觉悟，有力地推动了文化大革命和各项工作蓬勃向前发展。
    大办毛泽东思想学习班，把郊区活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新高潮，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到大宣传、大普及、大运用。毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和最新指示已经家喻户晓，深入人心，不仅青年能背诵，许多不识字的老贫农和妇女也能背几段。随着毛泽东思想的大普及、大运用，京郊农村的革命和生产形势越来越好。全郊区十四个县区已有十二个县区成立革命委员会或革筹小组；扎扎实实的冬季生产热潮正在掀起，新的农业大跃进的令人兴奋的气象已经露头。
    北京郊区农村举办的学习班有三个基本特点：
    第一，充分相信和依靠广大贫下中农和革命干部。郊区很多社队在办学习班时，从组织领导、学习内容到学习方法都贯彻群众路线，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。办学习班的干部同时也是学员，和大家一起学习。学习中，群众提出的问题，自己对照毛主席的指示进行讨论，自己找答案。如学习班在进行形势教育时，开始，队干部对形势看法有分歧，他们就采取一摆（摆全国和本地的大好形势）、二谈（谈大好形势的由来）、三对照（用毛主席的最新指示对照自己的看法）、四议论（对一些不同的看法开展深入讨论）、五总结提高的办法来解决，收到了良好效果。很多队干部说：“自己真搞通了，就记得住，回去传达不走样。”平谷县山东庄公社学习班开办时，一些参加学习的干部，对文化大革命的伟大意义认识不足，不能正确地对待群众运动，不能正确地对待自己。在人民解放军帮助下，这个公社的革命委员会组织大家反复认真地学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示。这些干部提高了阶级觉悟，很快就改变了态度。他们越学，对党对毛主席的感情越深，越学革命干劲越大。
    第二，自始至终坚持正面教育。各地依靠群众创造了许多行之有效的正面教育的方法。主要是：（一）学习和革命大批判相结合，将斗争矛头紧紧对准中国赫鲁晓夫和以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团及其在当地的代理人。每期学习班都利用一定的时间，有目的地开展大批判活动，举办批判专栏，开各种批判会。（二）大抓阶级教育。通过阶级教育，广大贫下中农和革命干部对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线更加忠诚，更加热爱。各地举办的学习班都广泛开展了“三忆三比”活动，即：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，比无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就；忆党对自己的培养教育，比自己对党对人民的贡献。（三）大抓典型，开“讲用会”，让典型当教师，让群众自己教育自己。在进行阶级教育时，让老贫农讲家史。有的山区社队还请抗日时期同敌人英勇斗争的老干部讲村史。对干部进行教育时，让站出来的革命干部讲自己活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，正确对待群众，正确对待自己的体会。
    第三，密切结合当前实际，形式灵活多样。每期学习班都以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和最新指示为纲，期期有中心，密切结合当前实际，针对当前干部、群众的活思想，一期解决一两个重要问题。如头一两期学习班着重解决一些基层干部的思想问题，解决两派群众组织负责人的对立情绪，促使大批革命干部站出来，大大巩固了革命的大联合，推动了革命的三结合。革命委员会成立后举办的学习班着重解决新、老干部之间的关系和干部思想革命化问题。很多生产队办的学习班学习了《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，为今冬更深入地开展革命大批判作了思想准备。学习班的组织形式灵活多样，创造条件，让更多的人参加学习。有些社队还注意将短期学习班和经常的毛主席著作学习结合起来，使得毛主席著作的学习更加经常化制度化。
