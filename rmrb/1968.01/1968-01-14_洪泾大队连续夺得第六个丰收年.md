Hongjing Brigade in Taicang, Jiangsu, achieved its sixth consecutive bumper harvest last year, with both grain and cotton production exceeding that of 1966. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the brigade said: Last year's bumper harvest was achieved by following Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production" and by fighting against class enemies, the "selfish" thoughts in our minds, and nature.

    洪泾大队连续夺得第六个丰收年
    江苏太仓洪泾大队，去年获得了连续第六年的大丰收，粮棉都比一九六六年增产。这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部说：去年的大丰收，是遵照毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的教导，与阶级敌人、头脑里的
  “私”字和大自然斗出来的。
