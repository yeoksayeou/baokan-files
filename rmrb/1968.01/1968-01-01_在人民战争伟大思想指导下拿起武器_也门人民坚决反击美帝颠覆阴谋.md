In the fight against the subversion of the Yemeni Republican government, which was orchestrated by American imperialism, the Yemeni people's fighting spirit is growing stronger. The broad masses of the Yemeni people have come to realize that to smash the armed aggression plotted by American imperialism, they must rely on the Yemeni people themselves, and on the organized people taking up arms to wage a resolute struggle.

In recent times, American imperialism has openly instigated the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia to support the Yemeni royalist forces, and together with foreign mercenaries, they have invaded the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, in an attempt to realize their evil plan of subverting the Yemeni Republican government. However, the plots of American imperialism have been met with strong resistance from the Yemeni government and people.

As soon as the counterattack began, the broad masses of the Yemeni people, with the support of the government, quickly formed a people's self-defense force. This self-defense force is composed of workers, youth, students, government officials, and office workers who volunteered to join. The government issued a gun to each member. Now, the self-defense force has grown to over five thousand people.

The self-defense force members go to work with their guns during the day, receive military training after work, and stand guard and patrol at night, vigilantly protecting the city. Some members have gone to the front lines to fight alongside the Yemeni armed forces. A leader of the people's self-defense force, when introducing the formation of the self-defense force to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, said: "Before the formation of the people's self-defense force, we studied Chairman Mao's articles on people's war. It is under the great thought of people's war of Chairman Mao that we formed the people's self-defense force."

    在人民战争伟大思想指导下拿起武器
    也门人民坚决反击美帝颠覆阴谋
    据新华社萨那电　也门人民在反击由美帝国主义一手策划的颠覆也门共和政权的战斗中，斗志越来越昂扬。广大的也门人民认识到，要粉碎美帝策划的武装进攻，必须依靠也门人民自己，依靠组织起来的人民拿起武器进行坚决的斗争。
    最近以来，美帝国主义公然唆使沙特阿拉伯反动势力，支持也门王室势力，伙同外国雇佣军窜犯也门首都萨那，以实现其颠覆也门共和政权的罪恶计划。但是美帝国主义的阴谋遭到了也门政府和人民的有力反击。
    反击战一开始，广大也门人民在政府支持下很快组成了一支人民自卫队。这支人民自卫队由工人、青年、学生、政府官员、机关职员等自愿参加组成。政府发给每一个队员一支枪。现在人民自卫队已经发展到五千多人。
    自卫队员白天个个精神焕发地带枪上班工作，下班后进行军事训练，晚上进行着警卫和巡逻，警惕地保卫着城市。一部分队员到前线同也门武装部队一道参加战斗。一位人民自卫队领导成员在介绍自卫队成立经过时对新华社记者说：“在成立人民自卫队之前，我们学习了毛主席的有关论人民战争的文章。我们就是在毛主席的人民战争的伟大思想指导下成立了人民自卫队的。”
