The People's Liberation Army Air Force unit stationed in Tianjin's Hongwei District is a model unit for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the work of supporting the left. This unit, consisting of 148 comrades, is tasked with supporting the left in the Hongwei District, which has a population of over 500,000 and more than 300 factories. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study, model, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions, turning them into the soul of the masses and the conscious actions of the people. This ensures that the Cultural Revolution in the Hongwei District always advances along the revolutionary path charted by Chairman Mao.

	Hearing the Latest Instructions from Chairman Mao and Acting on Them Immediately

	Vice Chairman Lin has instructed us: "In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief, and we, under the great commander's leadership, should listen well to the words of our commander-in-chief, Chairman Mao. The Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!" Since the unit began its task of supporting the left, it has not hesitated in carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, has not wavered in following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and has not distorted Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The Party committee of the unit supporting the left believes that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is not just a matter of work methods, but a matter of political direction, a fundamental stance, and an attitude towards Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the compass for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, representing the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers, and are the beacon guiding our work of supporting the left. The work of supporting the left is complex and ever-changing, with sharp and complicated struggles. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guiding principle and subordinate everything to the combat orders of the supreme commander, Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao instructed: "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist masses." They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, wholeheartedly and unambiguously standing on the side of the revolutionary leftist masses, becoming a strong backbone for the left. The Hongwei District has over a thousand mass organizations, and they have not supported a single incorrect one. The Pingyuan Knitting Factory had a revolutionary mass organization that, due to the severe suppression of the capitalist roaders' line, was reduced to one person. They were not afraid of difficulties or risks and firmly supported this organization. They said: "Chairman Mao ordered us to support the left, and we must do so with single-minded determination. Whether there are many people or just one, we must support them." Soon, this revolutionary mass organization, with their support, rapidly grew and strengthened.

	The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District always acts immediately upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follows them, and carries them out resolutely. They say: "Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be followed resolutely, actively, and swiftly." In September of last year, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, conveyed and implemented this instruction to the revolutionary masses throughout the district, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions directly accessible to the people. They went deep into workshops, canteens, and dormitories, enthusiastically propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that within two days, everyone in the district was familiar with them. The propaganda team stationed at San Tiao Shi did not eat or sleep, going to various factories to propagate. Twelve people in one day and night visited 58 factories, reading Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the workers. The workers with a glorious revolutionary history at San Tiao Shi understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply, acted quickly, and carried them out resolutely. The workers said excitedly: "We workers suffered the deepest oppression and exploitation before liberation. Now we should follow Chairman Mao the closest. Chairman Mao calls on us workers to achieve revolutionary great unity, and we must take the lead!" The propaganda team members scattered throughout the district's various factories stayed up all night with the broad masses, seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, repeatedly discussing measures to achieve revolutionary great unity, and doing painstaking ideological and political work. The entire district quickly achieved revolutionary great unity, taking the lead in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin.

	The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District always studies Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously and deeply understands them, ensuring they are implemented correctly. They believe that supporting the left does not mean supporting factions. If they were to support factions, it would go against Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In some factories, both factions are revolutionary mass organizations. They do not support one faction and suppress the other but help both sides achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles. In some factories, one faction was misled at the time. They do not favor one faction and ignore the other but patiently help the misled masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	The propaganda team stationed at the Color Weaving Factory No. 3 is a model for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and adhering to the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting factions." This factory originally had two factions. One was a revolutionary mass organization, and the other was misled at the time. The propaganda team did not support one faction and suppress the other but actively supported the "Rebel Corps," while using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the misled masses, helping them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At that time, the "Rebel Corps" did not understand this approach, thinking it was "playing it safe," and they even wanted to take measures to "swallow" the other side. Facing this situation, the propaganda team, with great enthusiasm for protecting the left, pointed out to the "Rebel Corps" that their actions did not align with the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They then, together with the revolutionary masses of the "Rebel Corps," seriously studied Mao Zedong's works, helping them, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, correctly treat the misled masses. At the same time, they mobilized various mass organizations to hold a great debate on the struggle between the two lines, jointly holding a meeting to expose and criticize the crimes of the capitalist roaders' line. Through these activities, the revolutionary masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines greatly increased. They consciously placed themselves in the struggle between the two lines, raising the issue to the level of the struggle between the two lines. The "Rebel Corps" took a high stance, actively examined their shortcomings, and other mass organizations also examined their mistakes, expressing their determination to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with the "Rebel Corps." Both sides eliminated the long-standing estrangement and achieved revolutionary great unity on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Overcoming Interference, Eliminating Factionalism, and Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions in Struggle

	The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District did not find it smooth sailing in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They broke through all obstacles, eliminated all interference, and, in the struggle, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, advancing firmly along the course charted by Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

	Just as the revolutionary leftists in the Hongwei District were following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and achieving revolutionary great unity, Liu Shaoqi in Tianjin, in order to save his doomed fate, colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society, using the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends within the revolutionary ranks, spreading rumors, creating divisions, interfering with the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and sabotaging Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In this situation, the unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District braved the storm, advanced courageously, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions without the slightest hesitation, defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions without the slightest wavering. They fought wherever interference came from, swiftly launching revolutionary criticism and promoting revolutionary great unity.

	When a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party incited uninformed masses to attempt to provoke armed conflict in the Hongwei District, disrupting revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great unity, they dared to go against the current, staying up all night to do ideological mobilization among the masses. They propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions on carrying out revolutionary criticism and achieving revolutionary great unity to over 2,000 leaders of various factions in the district. Factories, offices, enterprises, and schools quickly took action, holding various criticism meetings and bitter struggle meetings, smashing the enemy's plots.

	The two factions in the Woodworking Factory, with the help of the propaganda team stationed in the factory, were about to achieve revolutionary great unity when the ultra-leftist trends in society spread to the Woodworking Factory. Some mass organizations in society, deceived by the class enemy, said that the revolutionary great unity in the Woodworking Factory was a forced merger. Some people, hearing these words, hesitated and advocated waiting. Facing this interference, the propaganda team stationed in the factory remained unwavering. They immediately organized the revolutionary masses of the Woodworking Factory to hold a great debate on closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They made everyone realize that Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be followed closely and cannot be delayed. No matter how strong the interference, Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented resolutely. At the same time, the propaganda team stationed in the factory also went to the mass organizations that opposed the great unity in the Woodworking Factory, doing in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, explaining that achieving revolutionary great unity is Chairman Mao's great call and the correct direction. They must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and absolutely not allow interference, never falling for the class enemy's tricks. Thus, Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary great unity were quickly implemented, and the Woodworking Factory achieved revolutionary great unity. Those mass organizations also saw through the class enemy's plots and achieved revolutionary great unity in their own factories one after another.

	The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District not only braved interference but also, through the method of establishing various models for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively attacked various interferences, firmly guiding the broad masses onto the revolutionary path charted by Chairman Mao. Whenever Chairman Mao issued a combat order or a latest instruction, they promptly established models for closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing the latest instructions.

	After Chairman Mao issued the "March 7" directive, they immediately established the model of the Color Weaving Factory No. 3, which eliminated factional interference and took the lead in achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. Soon, a batch of factories in the district achieved revolutionary great unity.

	When the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued the combat order to carry out revolutionary criticism, they established the model of the Pingyuan Knitting Factory, which eliminated interference, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and carried out revolutionary criticism, swiftly promoting the revolutionary criticism throughout the district.

	When Chairman Mao called for "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," they promptly established the model of the Color Weaving Factory No. 4, which eliminated the interference of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything," and boldly liberated cadres. The factories in the district quickly liberated over 90% of the revolutionary leading cadres.

	The power of examples is boundless. The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their compass and models for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guides, eliminated various interferences and led the broad revolutionary masses to advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

	After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," the unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District more clearly realized that without criticizing and repudiating selfishness, factionalism could not be overcome, and interference could not be eliminated. Only by fiercely criticizing and repudiating selfishness, igniting a revolution in the depths of one's soul, could Chairman Mao's latest instructions truly be turned into the conscious actions of the broad masses. They enthusiastically helped the revolutionary leftists in factories, offices, and neighborhoods to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The first lesson in the study class was to focus on Chairman Mao's latest instructions, holding various comparison and struggle activities, criticizing factionalism, and exposing selfishness, guiding everyone to better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The Valve Factory had two mass organizations that had been fighting "internal wars" since their establishment. After Chairman Mao issued the combat order for revolutionary great unity, Liu Yonghai, the leader of the "United Committee," still thought that he had rebelled early, had many people, and had a strong organization, so unity must be centered around him and use his banner. However, Liu Shikuan, the leader of the "Thunder and Lightning Revolutionary Rebel Corps," firmly disagreed, insisting on adding a "great" character before the "United Committee" to show that he had not been "swallowed." Thus, they quarreled over a single character without end.

	The unit supporting the left invited Liu Yonghai and Liu Shikuan to the Mao Zedong Thought study class. Liu Yonghai wanted to criticize and repudiate selfishness at the meeting but was afraid that the other side would grab his weaknesses, so he swallowed his words. The soldiers of the unit supporting the left unanimously believed that without fiercely criticizing and repudiating the "selfishness" in one's mind, one could not see the path forward, take steps forward, plant Mao Zedong Thought deeply, or implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They, targeting Liu Yonghai's active thoughts, had a heart-to-heart talk with him, encouraging him to take the spirit of Nian Siping, who fiercely criticized and repudiated selfishness with a "momentary thought," as an example, launching a fierce attack on selfishness. Liu Yonghai, after a fierce struggle in his mind, stood up to criticize and repudiate selfishness, checking his erroneous thoughts of "unique rebellion" and apologizing to Liu Shikuan, whom he had attacked. Liu Yonghai's criticism deeply moved Liu Shikuan, who also stood up to criticize and repudiate selfishness. Thus, the two "enemies" became "friends," and a "pair of opposites" became a "pair of reds." There is an Eighth Street in the Hongwei District. This street had ten factories, and due to factionalism, it had become a battlefield for "internal wars," and people called it the "Division Street." In the study class, the unit supporting the left guided the masses to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" as weapons, eliminating factionalism, stopping "internal wars," and jointly carrying out revolutionary criticism. They also jointly held a meeting, changing the name of this street to "Unity Street." The masses in the Hongwei District said well: "Criticizing and repudiating selfishness and establishing public spirit, keeping Chairman Mao's latest instructions in mind, forever following Chairman Mao, and not losing the way forward."

	Believing in the Masses, Relying on the Masses, and Widely Mobilizing the Masses to Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

	Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District followed Chairman Mao's teachings, together with the broad revolutionary leftists, forming a vast army of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda, launching a mass movement to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The Hongwei District has over 300 factories and a population of over 500,000, while the soldiers of the unit supporting the left number only 148. They made their greatest efforts, and the factories they first entered were less than one-tenth of the entire district. The masses eagerly hoped that the People's Liberation Army would enter the factories early to help them carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers also said: "Our support for the left cannot be just a spot of red; it must be a vast expanse of red." What should they do? The unit supporting the left followed Chairman Mao's teachings, mobilizing and relying on the masses. They divided the entire district into seven large areas, and each large area was further divided into several small areas. Large areas established workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and small areas established part-time Mao Zedong Thought propaganda networks between factories, widely carrying out "one helps one" and "one red pair" activities. The mass ideological and political work was lively and vivid, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions were more widely implemented among the broad revolutionary masses, powerfully promoting the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement.

	With the help of the unit supporting the left, the Red Star Paper Box Factory achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination. They saw that the nearby Tianjin Battery Factory, although united in organization, still could not establish a core leadership. They actively sent two comrades to help solve the problem. After the two comrades from the Red Star Paper Box Factory arrived at the Tianjin Battery Factory, they found that they were arguing fiercely over seats. The two comrades from the Red Star Paper Box Factory and the unit supporting the left organized them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and introduced their factory's experience in overcoming factionalism, enhancing unity, and achieving revolutionary great unity, finally helping the two factions in the Tianjin Battery Factory to form a great unity core leadership under revolutionary principles. These two factories became a "red pair." Then they went together to help the Limin Bed Sheet Factory. The two factions in the Limin Bed Sheet Factory, although united in organization, were not united in thought and still hung two banners, working in two places. The comrades from the Red Star Paper Box Factory and the Tianjin Battery Factory invited the representatives of the Limin Bed Sheet Factory, letting the comrades from the Limin Bed Sheet Factory present their problems, and they and the unit supporting the left "diagnosed" together. The two organizations in the Limin Bed Sheet Factory, after everyone's patient help, received profound education. They united in thought, took down the banners that night, and merged the offices. The "red pair" became a vast expanse of red. The workers said: "The comrades from the People's Liberation Army implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line most resolutely. They believe in and rely on the masses, so the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda network appeared."

	Currently, under the help of the unit supporting the left, the factories in the Hongwei District have universally carried out mass mutual assistance in ideology. If one factory does well, all factories learn from it; if one factory has problems, all factories help solve them. Factories and factories, individuals and individuals, gradually established a new type of revolutionary mutual assistance relationship based on Mao Zedong Thought. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, some factories had significant conflicts, and other factories adopted the method of "sending out" to send people to help solve problems. Some factories' leaders who participated in the study had their thoughts straightened out, but the leaders at home did not, so everyone adopted the method of "inviting in," inviting the leaders at home to the study class to help solve problems. They studied Mao Zedong Thought together and jointly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "We communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we go to a place, we must combine with the local people, taking root, blooming, and bearing fruit among the people." The soldiers of the unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District, like red seeds, took root among the people. They enthusiastically passed on the experience of the People's Liberation Army in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the three-eighths style to the workers, office cadres, and enterprise personnel, helping them cultivate a large number of ideological and political work cadres. Under the help of the unit supporting the left, the broad revolutionary masses launched an unprecedented scale of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Criticizing and Repudiating Selfishness, Changing Worldviews, and Becoming Models for Studying, Implementing, Propagating, and Defending Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

	Chairman Mao taught us that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls and solves the problem of worldviews. The unit supporting the left in the Hongwei District deeply realized that to arm the masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they must first arm themselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. From the day they entered the Hongwei District, they took studying, understanding, mastering, and applying Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the central task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in their work of supporting the left, criticizing and repudiating selfishness, and changing worldviews, taking unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao as the fundamental standard for changing worldviews. At every moment when Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued and at every critical moment of struggle, they promptly held "directional meetings," seriously studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, doing as Chairman Mao said, truly arming their minds with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and setting the course.

	Soon after they entered the Hongwei District, some comrades stood on the side of the left but their hearts were not completely with the left, sometimes not understanding or approving of the left's revolutionary actions. At this time, the temporary Party committee of the unit supporting the left organized all the soldiers to immediately hold a "directional meeting," bringing problems to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest instructions repeatedly. They also invited the left to be teachers, listening to them denounce the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and recount their heroic struggles to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line under the persecution of the capitalist roaders' line. From this, the comrades deeply realized that the left is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and our attitude towards the left is our attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao can we have deep class feelings for the left; only by being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao can we completely unite our hearts with the left's hearts. In their work of supporting the left, they constantly brought problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, changing worldviews. Thus, the comrades further solidified their leftist stance, established leftist thoughts, and enhanced leftist feelings, loving the left with single-minded determination and working for the left with single-minded determination.

	Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The surging mass movement also greatly inspired and educated the army, becoming a revolutionary furnace for tempering and raising the army's political awareness." The unit supporting the left followed Vice Chairman Lin's instruction, taking the front line of supporting the left as a good battlefield for studying and applying Mao Zedong's works and changing worldviews, regularly carrying out "front-line rectification," using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the compass, through criticism and self-criticism, regularly checking and promptly summarizing the experiences and lessons of changing worldviews, consciously placing themselves in the struggle between the two lines, raising the issue to whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao, insisting on truth, correcting errors, criticizing and repudiating selfishness, and changing thoughts. Since March of last year, the district-wide "front-line rectification" has been carried out seven times, each time summarizing one or two experiences and lessons, solving one or two main problems. They felt that by constantly practicing and summarizing, never stopping the fire on the ideological battlefield, igniting a revolution in the depths of one's soul, they could deepen their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deepen their class feelings for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and turn their understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions from not fully understanding to deeply understanding, from not consciously implementing to very consciously implementing, making themselves never leave Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, always acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The unit supporting the left firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes" and, in the process of criticizing and repudiating selfishness and changing worldviews, took the masses as their teachers, humbly learning from the masses. They established a system of regularly exposing their selfishness to the masses, seeking opinions, regularly publicly checking and listening to criticisms, consciously placing themselves under the masses' supervision, reporting to the masses when there were problems in their thoughts, seeking advice from the masses when there were problems in their work, and absorbing extremely rich political nutrition.

	Recently, the temporary Party committee of the unit supporting the left organized all the soldiers to study the experience of Li Wenzhong, the model for supporting the left and loving the people, in studying and applying Mao Zedong's works and changing worldviews. All the soldiers took Li Wenzhong as their example, thoroughly exposing, fiercely criticizing and repudiating, and resolutely changing the "selfishness" in their minds, determined to become models for studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They made a grand vow to, in their work of supporting the left:

	Leave behind a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that never leaves;
	Establish a Mao Zedong Thought study class that is always open;
	Build a revolutionary leadership cadre that is always loyal to Chairman Mao.

	Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky of the Hongwei District.

    落实毛主席最新指示就是胜利
    ——记北京部队空军某部驻天津红卫区支左部队落实毛主席最新指示的先进事迹
    北京部队空军某部驻天津红卫区支左部队，是空军活学活用毛主席著作、在支左工作中落实毛主席最新指示的先进集体。
    这个支左部队只有一百四十八个同志，在有五十多万人口、三百多个工厂的红卫区执行支左任务。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对于毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，积极学习，模范执行，热情宣传，坚决捍卫，把毛主席的最新指示化为群众的灵魂，变为群众自觉的行动，使红卫区的无产阶级文化大革命始终沿着毛主席的革命轨道胜利前进。
      对毛主席最新指示闻风而动，
          紧紧跟上，坚决照办
    林副主席指示我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅，我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”红卫区支左部队执行支左任务以来，执行毛主席的最新指示不迟疑，紧跟毛主席的最新指示不动摇，落实毛主席的最新指示不走样。
    支左部队党委认为，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，这不是个工作方法问题，而是支左的政治方向问题，是根本立场问题，是对毛主席的态度问题。毛主席的最新指示是无产阶级文化大革命的指针，代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，是照耀我们支左工作前进的灯塔。支左工作千头万绪，情况千变万化，斗争尖锐复杂，我们必须以毛主席的最新指示为纲，一切服从最高统帅毛主席的战斗号令。
    毛主席指示：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”。他们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，满腔热情地、毫不含糊地站在左派广大革命群众一边，作左派的坚强后盾。红卫区有上千个群众组织，他们没有支错一个。平原针织厂有一个革命群众组织，由于资产阶级反动路线的严重摧残，最后剩下一个人，他们也不怕困难，敢担风险，坚决支持这个组织。他们说：“毛主席命令我们支持左派，我们就要一个心眼地坚决照办。人多，要支持，就是一个人也要支持。”不久，这个革命群众组织在他们的支持下，迅速发展壮大起来。
    红卫区支左部队对毛主席每一个最新指示，总是闻风而动，紧紧跟上，坚决照办。他们说：“毛主席的最新指示，就是要坚决地跟，积极地跟，迅速地跟。”去年九月，伟大领袖毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示，他们以最大的热情，最快的速度，向全区革命群众传达贯彻，使毛主席的最新指示直接和群众见面。他们深入车间、食堂、宿舍，热情宣传贯彻毛主席的最新指示，两天内就做到了全区群众家喻户晓。驻三条石毛泽东思想宣传队，饭不吃，觉不睡，到各工厂去进行宣传。十二个人一天一夜就到了五十八个工厂，向职工群众宣读了毛主席的最新指示。具有光荣革命斗争历史的三条石工人阶级，对毛主席的最新指示理解得深，行动得快，执行得坚决。工人们激动地说：“我们工人解放前受剥削受压迫最深，现在我们应该跟毛主席最紧。毛主席号召我们工人阶级实现革命的大联合，我们就一定要打头阵！”分散在全区各个工厂的宣传队员，连夜和广大群众一起认真学习毛主席最新指示，反复讨论实现革命大联合的措施，作艰苦细致的思想政治工作，全区很快地实现了革命的大联合，走在天津市无产阶级文化大革命的最前列。
    红卫区支左部队对毛主席的最新指示总是认真学习，深刻领会，在落实过程中不走样。他们认为，毛主席要我们支左，不是要我们支派，如果支派，就违背了毛主席的最新指示。有的厂两派都是革命群众组织，他们不是支一派，压一派，而是帮助双方在革命原则下尽快地实现革命的大联合。有的厂有两派，其中一派当时是受了蒙蔽的，他们不是热一派，冷一派，而是耐心地帮助受蒙蔽群众回到毛主席革命路线上来。
    驻色织三厂毛泽东思想宣传队，就是全面落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持“支左不支派”的一个典型。这个厂原来有两大派。一派是革命群众组织，另一派当时是受了蒙蔽的。宣传队不是支一派，压一派，而是积极支持“造反大队”，同时，用毛泽东思想教育受蒙蔽的群众，热情帮助他们回到毛主席革命路线上来。当时，“造反大队”对宣传队这种做法不理解，认为是“和稀泥”，他们甚至要采取办法，把对方“吃”掉。针对这种情况，宣传队抱着爱护左派的极大热情，向“造反大队”指出他们的行为是不符合毛主席最新指示精神的。于是就和“造反大队”的革命群众一起认真学习毛主席著作，帮助他们按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众。同时，发动各群众组织开展关于两条路线斗争的大讨论，共同召开揭发批判资产阶级反动路线罪行大会。通过这些活动，广大革命群众两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高了，他们自觉地把自己摆到两条路线斗争中去，把问题提到两条路线斗争的纲上来。“造反大队”以高姿态主动检查了自己的缺点，其他群众组织也检查了自己的错误，表示要坚决地和“造反大队”一起站在毛主席革命路线一边。双方消除了过去长期存在的隔阂，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命的大联合。
    排除干扰，克服派性，在斗争中落实毛主席最新指示
    红卫区支左部队落实毛主席的最新指示并不是一帆风顺的。他们冲破一切阻力，排除一切干扰，在斗争中落实，坚定不移地沿着毛主席最新指示指引的航向，阔步前进！
    正当红卫区无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展革命的大批判，实行革命大联合的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的代理人，为了挽救他们即将灭亡的命运，伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，利用革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，造谣生事，制造分裂，干扰毛主席最新指示的落实，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。在这种情况下，红卫区支左部队顶住风浪，勇往直前，落实毛主席最新指示一分一秒不迟疑，捍卫毛主席最新指示一丝一毫不动摇。干扰来自哪里，就战斗在哪里，迅速开展革命大批判，促进革命大联合。
    当党内一小撮走资派煽动不明真相的群众企图到红卫区挑动武斗，破坏革命大批判和革命大联合的时候，他们敢顶逆流，连夜深入群众做思想发动工作。向全区各派群众组织的两千多个头头宣传毛主席关于开展革命大批判和实现革命大联合的最新指示，各工厂、机关、企业、学校就很快行动起来，各种批判会、忆苦会开得热火朝天，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
    工农兵木器厂两派群众组织，在驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，就要实行革命大联合的时候，社会上的极“左”思潮波及到了木器厂。社会上持有不同观点的某些群众组织，由于上了阶级敌人的当，他们说木器厂的革命大联合是大捏合。有的人听了这些话就犹豫了，主张等一等。面对这种干扰，驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队，毫不动摇，他们立即组织木器厂革命群众开展了一场紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大讨论。使大家认识到，毛主席的最新指示，只能紧跟，不能迟疑，外面就是刮十二级台风也要顶住，不管干扰多大，最新指示要坚决落实。同时，驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队还亲自到反对木器厂大联合的那些群众组织里面去，做深入细致的思想政治工作，说明搞革命大联合是毛主席的伟大号召，是大方向，对毛主席的最新指示只能坚决执行，绝对不许干扰，万万不可上阶级敌人的当。这样，毛主席关于革命大联合的指示很快落实了，木器厂实现了革命大联合，那些群众组织也识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，先后在本厂实现了革命大联合。
    红卫区支左部队不仅顶住干扰，而且通过树立各类落实毛主席最新指示的先进典型的方法，向各种干扰主动进攻，坚决把广大群众引导到毛主席指引的无产阶级的革命轨道上来。毛主席每发出一次战斗号令，每提出一项最新指示，他们都及时树立紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，落实最新指示的典型。
    毛主席发出“三·七”批示后，他们立即树立了色织三厂排除派性干扰，一马当先实现全厂革命大联合的典型，随之全区就有一批工厂实现了革命大联合。
    以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出开展革命大批判的战斗号令，他们又树立了平原针织厂排除干扰，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，搞好革命大批判的典型，迅速推动了全区的革命大批判。
    毛主席发出要“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的号召，他们马上树立了色织四厂排除“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的干扰，大胆解放干部的典型，全区工厂又很快解放了百分之九十以上革命领导干部。
      榜样的力量是无穷的。红卫区支左部队就是这样
  以毛主席最新指示导航，用落实毛主席最新指示的典型引路，排除了各种干扰，带领广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署胜利前进。
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召以后，红卫区支左部队更明确地认识到“私”字斗不掉，派性就打不倒，干扰就排除不了，只有狠狠斗私，启发大家在灵魂深处爆发革命，才能真正把毛主席最新指示变成广大群众的自觉行动。他们热情地帮助工厂、机关、街道的无产阶级革命派，大办毛泽东思想学习班。学习班的第一课，就是大讲毛主席最新指示，开展各种忆比活动，斗派性，挖私心，引导大家更好地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    调节阀厂有两个群众组织，自成立以来，长期打
  “内战”。毛主席关于实现革命大联合的战斗号令发出以后，“联合委员会”负责人刘永海还认为自己造反早，人马多，牌子硬，要联合必须以我为核心，挂我的牌子。可是“风雷革命造反队”负责人刘士宽坚决不答应，一定要在“联合委员会”前头加上一个“大”字，以示自己没有被人“吃掉”。就这样，为了一个“大”字，争个不休。
    支左部队把刘永海和刘士宽请进毛泽东思想学习班。刘永海想在会上斗私，但是又担心对方抓小辫子，便把想要说的话又咽了下去。支左部队指战员一致认为，不狠斗头脑里的“私”字，就看不清前进的路，迈不开前进的步，毛泽东思想就扎不下根，毛主席最新指示就不能落实。他们针对刘永海的活思想，找他谈心，鼓励他以年四旺狠斗私心“一闪念”的精神为榜样，破私猛打进攻战。刘永海经过激烈的思想斗争，上台斗私了，他检查了自己“唯我独革”的错误思想，向被自己攻击过的刘士宽赔礼道歉。刘永海的检查深深地感动了刘士宽，他也上台斗私了。就这样，两个“冤家”变成了“亲家”，“一对崩”变成了“一对红”。红卫区有条八号路，这条路上有十家工厂，过去由于派性作怪，把这条街搞成了打“内战”的战场，人们叫它“分裂路”。在学习班里，支左部队引导群众以毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”为武器，消除了派性，停止了“内战”，共同搞起了革命大批判，他们还联合召开了一次大会，把这条街改为“团结路”。红卫区的群众说得好：“破私立公抓住纲，毛主席最新指示心里装，永远紧跟毛主席，前进路上不迷航。”
      相信群众，依靠群众，广泛
  发动群众落实毛主席最新指示
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”驻红卫区支左部队遵循毛主席的教导，与广大无产阶级革命派一道，组成了浩浩荡荡的毛泽东思想宣传大军，掀起了群众性的落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。
    红卫区有三百多个工厂，五十多万人口，而支左部队的指战员只有一百四十八人。他们作了最大的努力，第一批进入的工厂还不到全区的十分之一。群众迫切希望解放军早日进厂，帮助他们搞好无产阶级文化大革命。指战员们也说：“我们支左不能只红一点，要红一片。”怎么办呢？支左部队遵照毛主席的教导，动员群众，依靠群众。他们把全区分成七个大片，大片下面又分若干小片，大片建立工人毛泽东思想宣传
  队，小片建立厂与厂之间的业余毛泽东思想宣传网，广泛开展了“一帮一”、“一对红”活动，群众性的思想政治工作搞得生动活泼，毛主席的最新指示更广泛地落实到广大革命群众中去，有力地推动了无产阶级文化大革命运动的胜利开展。
    红星纸箱厂在支左部队帮助下，实现了革命三结合以后，他们看到临近的天津电池厂组织上虽然联合了，核心领导班子却迟迟建立不起来，便主动派了两个同志去帮助解决。红星纸箱厂的两个同志来到天津电池厂以后，发现他们在席位上争执得很厉害。红星纸箱厂的两个同志和支左部队一起，组织他们反复学习毛主席的最新指示，并向他们介绍了自己厂克服派性，增强团结，实现革命大联合的体会，终于帮助电池厂的两派，在革命原则下，组成了大联合核心领导机构。这两个工厂便成了“一对红”。接着他们又一起去帮助利民床单厂。利民床单厂的两派虽然组织上联合起来了，思想上还没有联合，仍然挂着两个牌子，在两个地方办公。红星纸箱厂和天津电池厂的同志就把利民床单厂的代表请来，让利民床单厂的同志摆问题，他们和支左部队一起“会诊”。利民床单厂的两个组织经过大家的耐心帮助，受到了深刻的教育。思想上联合起来了，当晚就把牌子摘下来，办公室也合并了。“一对红”又变成了一片红。工人们说：“解放军同志执行毛主席革命路线最坚决，他们相信群众、依靠群众，所以才出现了毛泽东思想宣传网。”
    目前，在支左部队帮助下，红卫区的各个工厂，群众性的思想互助普遍开展起来，一厂做得好，各厂共同学；一厂有问题，各厂共同帮。工厂与工厂、个人与个人之间，逐渐在毛泽东思想基础上建立起新型的革命互助关系。在毛泽东思想学习班里有的工厂矛盾较大，其它工厂就采取“派出去”的办法，派人去帮助他们解决问题。有的工厂参加学习的头头思想通了，家里的头头不通，大家又采取“请进来”的办法，把家里的头头请到学习班来，帮助他们解决问题。他们就是这样，一起学习毛泽东思想，共同落实毛主席最新指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”战斗在红卫区的支左部队指战员，象一颗颗红色的种子，扎根在人民群众之中。他们满腔热情地把人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等行之有效的政治工作经验，传授给工人、机关干部和企业工作人员，帮助他们培养出大批思想政治工作骨干。广大革命群众在支左部队帮助下，掀起了空前规模的活学活用毛泽东思想、活学活用毛主席最新指示的新高潮。
      斗私批修，改造世界观，做
  学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最
  新指示的模范
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。红卫区支左部队，深刻认识到，要用毛主席最新指示武装群众，先要用毛主席最新指示武装自己。他们从进驻红卫区的第一天起，就把在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，学习、领会、掌握、运用毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，作为在支左中活学活用毛泽东思想，“斗私，批修”，改造世界观的中心课题，把无限忠于毛主席作为改造世界观的根本标准。在每次毛主席最新指示下达的时候，在每个斗争的关键时刻，他们都及时举行“定向会”，认真学习、深刻领会毛主席最新指示，毛主席怎么说就怎么做，真正用毛主席最新指示武装头脑，定准航向。
      他们进驻红卫区不久，有的同志人站在左派一边，但心还没有完全站到左派一边，有时对左派的革命行动看不惯、不理解。这时支左部队临时党委组织全体指战员立即开“定向会”，带着问题反复学习、讨论毛主席最新指示，并且请左派当教员，听他们控诉党内一小撮走资派的滔天罪行，讲述自己在资产阶级反动路线的迫害下，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线英勇斗争的事迹。从这里，同志们深刻认识到，左派无限忠于毛主席革命路线，我们对左派的态度，就是对毛主席革命路线的态度。我们对毛主席无限忠诚，才能对左派满怀阶级感情；只有无限忠于毛主席，才能把我们的心和左派的心完全连在一起。他们在支左中，不断带着问题活学活用毛主席最新指示，改造世界观。这样，同志们进一步坚定了左派的立场，树立了左派的思想，增强了左派的感情，一个心眼爱左派，一个心眼为左派。
    林副主席指示我们：“汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是反过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。”支左部队遵照林副主席这一指示，把支左斗争第一线当作活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观的好战场，定期开展“火线整风”，以毛主席最新指示为指针，通过批评和自我批评，经常检查、及时总结改造世界观的经验教训，自觉地把自己放到两条路线斗争中去，把问题提到是不是忠于毛主席的高度上来，坚持真理，修正错误，破私立公，改造思想。去年三月以来，全区性的“火线整风”已经进行了七次，每次着重总结一两条经验教训，解决一两个主要问题。他们体会到，这样不断实践，不断总结，在思想战场上永不停火，在灵魂深处爆发革命，就会提高对毛主席最新指示的认识，加深对毛主席最新指示的阶级感情，就能对毛主席的指示，由不甚理解变为深刻理解，由执行不够自觉变为非常自觉，使自己寸步不离毛主席的伟大战略部署，处处照毛主席最新指示办事。
    支左部队牢记毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，在“斗私，批修”，改造世界观的过程中，拜群众为师，老老实实向群众学习。他们建立了经常向群众亮私交心、征求意见，定期向群众公开检查、听取批评的制度，自觉地把自己置于群众的监督之下，思想上有了问题向群众汇报，工作上有了问题向群众请教，吸取了极为丰富的政治营养。
    最近，支左部队临时党委组织全体指战员，学习了“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观的经验。全体指战员以李文忠同志为榜样，对头脑里的“私”字，彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，决心使自己成为一个学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。他们立下宏伟志愿，要在支左中：
    留下永远不走的毛泽东思想宣传队；
    办好永远开办的毛泽东思想学习班；
    建立永远忠于毛主席的革命化领导班子。
    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在红卫区上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
