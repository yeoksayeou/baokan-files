Malayan left-wing trade unions recently issued a New Year message, enthusiastically hailing the current world situation as having "entered a new era of Mao Zedong Thought."

The message, published in the Malayan newspaper *The Frontline*, said that the past year was one in which revolutionary forces worldwide continued to overwhelm and defeat U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries. In this year, the struggle for national liberation by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America entered a new stage. Oppressed nations and peoples, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, waged revolutionary wars against imperialism and its lackeys' counter-revolutionary wars.

The message continued: The revolutionary war of the Vietnamese people has dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys. In North America, Oceania, and Europe, the struggle of the proletariat against monopoly capital has seen new developments.

The message stated that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carried out by the great People's Republic of China has achieved decisive victories, and its great international significance is immeasurable. On the one hand, it has accelerated and promoted the unity of revolutionary forces worldwide on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, launching new battles; on the other hand, the ugly face of Soviet revisionism's betrayal of the proletariat and national liberation movements has been more thoroughly exposed.

The message said that the Malayan people, like billions of revolutionary people worldwide, have boundless admiration and worship for the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the red banner of "Revolution is no crime, rebellion is justified," they actively joined the struggle against U.S.-British imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. At the same time, they launched a movement to study "The Three Articles" and other ideological education.

The message pointed out that it can be foreseen that future struggles will be arduous, but as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, believe in the masses, and rely on the masses, then we shall be invincible!

    马来亚左翼工会新年献词谈世界革命大好形势
    欢呼世界进入毛泽东思想的新纪元
    中国文化大革命的重大国际意义是不可估量的
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：马来亚左翼工会最近发表新年献词，热情欢呼当今的世界“已经进入毛泽东思想的新纪元”。
    在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》登载的这篇献词说，过去的一年，“是全世界革命力量继续压倒和战胜美帝、苏修和一切反动派的一年。在这一年里，亚、非、拉各国人民争取民族解放的斗争进入了一个崭新的阶段。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，以革命战争反对帝国主义及其走狗的反革命战争。”
    献词接着说：越南人民的革命战争给予美帝、苏修及其走狗以沉重的打击。在北美、大洋洲和欧洲，无产阶级反对垄断资本势力的斗争有了新的发展。
    献词说，伟大的中华人民共和国所进行的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，其重大的国际意义是不可估量的。它一方面加速和促进了世界革命力量在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，投入新的战斗；另一方面，苏修背叛无产阶级和民族解放运动的丑恶嘴脸更加暴露无遗。
    献词说，马来亚人民同全世界亿万革命人民一样，无限敬仰，无限崇拜光焰无际的毛泽东思想，他们在“革命无罪，造反有理”的红旗下，积极地投入了反对美英帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的战斗。同时，还展开了学习“老三篇”等思想教育运动。
    献词指出，可以预见，未来的斗争是艰苦的，但是，只要我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，相信群众，依靠群众，那么，就将无往而不胜！
