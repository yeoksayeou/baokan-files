The masses of the Hai Village Production Brigade have been fully mobilized. Every household, men, women, old, and young, from elementary school students to the elderly, all participate in revolutionary criticism, indignantly denouncing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. Revolutionary criticism is carried out with great fervor, greatly promoting all work.

An important experience of the Hai Village Production Brigade in carrying out revolutionary criticism is to firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, arming them with Mao Zedong Thought, and doing a good job of ideological mobilization. At the same time, they are organized according to their different characteristics.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." To carry out revolutionary criticism in the countryside, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, form a revolutionary criticism army with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, unite with other revolutionary masses, and wage a "people's war." Only in this way can we thoroughly expose and criticize the reactionary fallacies propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," "exploitation is beneficial," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and the "Peach Garden Experience," as well as their reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique" and all their counter-revolutionary crimes of restoring capitalism, and ensure that great Mao Zedong Thought forever occupies all positions in the countryside.

All revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in the countryside should firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, seriously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, create good methods and experiences for carrying out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and make every household, field, and night school into classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and battlefields for carrying out revolutionary criticism. This will contribute to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the countryside's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    坚定地依靠贫下中农开展革命大批判
    海字大队广大社员群众充分发动起来了，家家户户，男女老少，从小学生到老年人，人人参加革命大批判，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村复辟资本主义的罪行。革命大批判搞得热火朝天，大大地推动了各项工作。
    海字大队进行革命大批判的一个重要经验，就是坚定地依靠贫农下中农，用毛泽东思想武装他们，切实地做好思想上的发动工作。同时根据他们的不同特点，把他们组织起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”开展农村的革命大批判，就必须遵照毛主席的教导，坚定地依靠贫农下中农，组成以贫农下中农为主体的革命批判大军，团结其他革命群众，打一场“人民战争”。这样，才能把中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“桃园经验”等等反动谬论，以及他们对干部实行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线和他们的一切复辟资本主义的反革命罪行，揭深批臭，让伟大的毛泽东思想永远占领农村的一切阵地。
    广大农村革命干部和革命群众组织负责人，都应该坚定地依靠贫农下中农，认真办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，创造出深入开展革命大批判的好办法、好经验，使家庭、地头和夜校都成为活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，进行革命大批判的战场，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，作出新的贡献。
