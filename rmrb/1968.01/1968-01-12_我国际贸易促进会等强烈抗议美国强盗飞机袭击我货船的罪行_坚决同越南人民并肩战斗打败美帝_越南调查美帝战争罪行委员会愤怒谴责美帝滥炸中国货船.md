The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and Others Strongly Protest the Crime of U.S. Pirate Aircraft Attacking Our Cargo Ship
Firmly Stand with the Vietnamese People to Fight and Defeat U.S. Imperialism
The Vietnam Committee for the Investigation of U.S. War Crimes Angrily Condemns U.S. Bombing of Chinese Cargo Ship

	BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) — The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the China Ocean Shipping Company today issued a statement firmly supporting the January 7 solemn statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the outrageous bombing by U.S. pirate aircraft of our cargo ship docked at a Vietnamese port, and strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' deliberate sabotage of normal international trade and navigation.

	The statement pointed out that this is another serious provocation by U.S. imperialism following its savage attack on our Red Flag 154 on November 25 last year, and another heinous crime committed against the Chinese people. It is a manifestation of U.S. imperialism's desperate struggle in the face of severe defeats in its aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement said that the U.S. imperialists attempt to use the despicable means of bombing Chinese cargo ships to disrupt normal trade between China and Vietnam, obstruct the great Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and achieve their evil goal of blockading the Vietnamese people. This will never succeed. It can only arouse greater anger among the Chinese people and strengthen the resolve of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples to unite more closely and defeat U.S. imperialism, further accelerating the failure of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement expressed that the Chinese people's full support for the great struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation is unwavering. We will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as our own, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and give a resounding blow to U.S. imperialism until we achieve complete victory.

	HANOI, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) — The Vietnam Committee for the Investigation of U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam issued a statement at a press conference today strongly condemning the serious crime of U.S. pirate aircraft bombing the Chinese cargo ship Red Flag 158.

	The statement pointed out that the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Chinese cargo ship is not an isolated incident. It shows that U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly provoking war against the People's Republic of China and grossly violating the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is part of the U.S. imperialists' mad "escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement pointed out that the U.S. aggressors attempt to use "escalation" to reverse their failures in Vietnam, but the more madly they escalate, the more severe their failures will be and the more they will face widespread international condemnation.

	The statement demanded that the U.S. must stop all acts of attacking, provoking, and threatening foreign merchant ships and must stop obstructing foreign merchant ships from entering and leaving the ports of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    我国际贸易促进会等强烈抗议美国强盗飞机袭击我货船的罪行
    坚决同越南人民并肩战斗打败美帝
    越南调查美帝战争罪行委员会愤怒谴责美帝滥炸中国货船
    新华社十一日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和中国远洋运输公司今天发表声明，坚决支持我外交部一月七日的严正声明，强烈抗议美帝强盗飞机猖狂轰炸我停泊在越南港口的货船，强烈谴责美帝蓄意破坏国际正常贸易和航行的强盗行径。
    声明指出，这是美帝国主义继去年十一月二十五日野蛮袭击我红旗一五四轮后又一次严重的挑衅事件，是对中国人民犯下的又一滔天罪行。这是美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中遭到惨重失败，走投无路，进行绝望挣扎的表现。
    声明说，美帝国主义妄图用轰炸中国货船的卑劣手段，破坏中越两国正常贸易往来，阻止伟大的中国人民对兄弟的越南人民抗美救国斗争的支援，以达到其封锁越南人民的罪恶目的，这是永远不会得逞的。这只能激起中国人民的更大愤怒，激起中越两国人民更加紧密团结打败美帝的决心，进一步加速美帝的失败。
    声明表示，中国人民全力支援英雄的越南人民的伟大抗美救国战争，是坚定不移的。我们一定按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把越南人民的斗争当作我们的斗争，同兄弟的越南人民并肩战斗，狠狠打击美帝国主义，直到取得彻底胜利。
    新华社河内十一日电越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会十一日在记者招待会上发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机轰炸中国货船红旗一五八号的严重罪行。
    声明指出，美国飞机轰炸中国货船，不是一件孤立的行动，它表明美帝国主义仍然顽固地对中华人民共和国进行战争挑衅，并且粗暴地侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权。它是美帝国主义对侵越战争进行疯狂的新“升级”的一个组成部分。
    声明指出，美国侵略者妄想用战争“升级”来挽救它在越南的失败，但是它越疯狂地进行“升级”，就越要遭到惨重的失败和受到世界广泛舆论的严厉谴责。
    声明要求美国必须停止对外国商船的一切袭击、挑衅、威胁的行动，必须停止阻止外国商船出入越南民主共和国的海港。
