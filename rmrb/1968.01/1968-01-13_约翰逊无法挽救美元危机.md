President Johnson of the United States eagerly reaffirmed the value of the dollar on New Year's Day this year and announced the adoption of "emergency measures" to improve the dollar's position. The U.S. ruling authorities are so anxious because, after the devaluation of the pound, the dollar's position has also greatly deteriorated, and the speculative wave of gold buying is fiercely attacking the dollar. To provide gold to the international market and stabilize the fixed exchange rate of the dollar to gold, the U.S. Treasury lost nearly $1 billion in gold in December alone, reducing the U.S. gold reserves to their lowest level in thirty years. The U.S. government had to issue statements six times in a row, guaranteeing that the dollar would not be devalued. Some countries participating in the international "gold pool" also expressed their "full support" for the dollar. However, all this is still not enough to alleviate the dollar crisis. Therefore, Johnson had to personally make a statement to try to stabilize public sentiment.

The dollar crisis is the result of the huge deficit in the U.S. international balance of payments and the insufficient gold reserves of the U.S. Treasury to cope with the gold run in the international market. Over the eighteen years since 1950, the U.S. has had a balance of payments deficit for seventeen years, ranging from tens of billions of dollars to several tens of billions of dollars, with a cumulative total of over $350 billion. Such a huge balance of payments deficit has led to a massive loss of U.S. gold reserves. In 1949, the U.S. held 70% of the world's gold in the capitalist world, valued at $245 billion, but now it has been reduced to less than $120 billion. The continued development of the U.S. balance of payments deficit will inevitably shake the credit of the dollar and create a serious dollar crisis. Therefore, the Johnson administration cannot but try every means to reduce the U.S. balance of payments deficit this year. The "emergency measures" announced in the new year include: using "compulsory" means to restrict U.S. private direct investment abroad, limiting private travel abroad, reducing loans from U.S. banks to foreign countries, cutting overseas military spending and "aid" to foreign countries, and at the same time expanding exports. However, the Johnson administration's "emergency measures" will not have much effect and will not be able to fundamentally solve the long-standing problem of the U.S. balance of payments deficit.

The huge deficit in the U.S. international balance of payments is mainly the result of U.S. imperialism's mad pursuit of aggressive and war policies worldwide and its intensified political, economic, and military control over other countries, especially the result of the war in Vietnam. The U.S. annual huge capital outflow, overseas military spending, and foreign aid expenditures are far from being offset by the tens of billions of dollars of surplus earned from trade. In 1964, the U.S. trade surplus reached a peak of $8.1 billion. However, that year, the U.S. capital outflow, overseas military spending, and foreign aid expenditures totaled approximately $110 billion, resulting in a balance of payments deficit of $2.9 billion. Because U.S. imperialism stubbornly pursues its arrogant plan to dominate the world but lacks the strength to do so, the Johnson administration cannot find a fundamental way to eliminate the balance of payments deficit and stabilize the credit of the dollar.

The Johnson administration has placed the focus of its "austerity measures" on restricting U.S. private direct investment abroad. However, the amount of U.S. private direct investment abroad is not something that can be restricted for a long time. As early as 1963, the Johnson administration invited the heads of the largest 500 U.S. companies and banks to discuss and agree to "voluntarily limit" overseas investment. However, the effect was very limited. By 1967, due to the significant increase in U.S. capital outflow, this "voluntary limitation" plan had completely failed. Now, the Johnson administration wants to replace "voluntary limitation" with "compulsory restriction," which will also be difficult to achieve.

The Johnson administration's plan to reduce U.S. foreign aid expenditures also faces great difficulties. For many years, U.S. foreign "aid" has mainly been used to prop up U.S. puppet regimes around the world, making it difficult to significantly reduce it. This year, the U.S. foreign aid budget is a few billion dollars less than last year. However, the actual expenditure of the entire U.S. foreign aid plan will still roughly maintain the level of previous years. The U.S. puppet regimes in various countries have been complaining for years about not receiving enough U.S. "aid." If Johnson further significantly cuts foreign aid expenditures, the U.S. colonial forces overseas will collapse even more rapidly.

The Johnson administration's plan to cut overseas military spending is purely talk. The U.S. is waging war everywhere in the world; how can its overseas military spending be reduced? The U.S. military spending in Vietnam alone amounts to more than $20 billion, accounting for more than half of the U.S. balance of payments deficit in 1967. With the vigorous development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and the people of various countries are becoming increasingly acute. Therefore, Johnson's so-called reduction of overseas military spending is purely deceitful.

The Johnson administration's restriction on U.S. private travel abroad to save foreign expenditures is merely a drop in the bucket, with a very limited amount. Moreover, other countries can also use the method of restricting their citizens from traveling to the U.S. to retaliate. Fifteen airlines from countries such as Britain and France have decided to study the reduction of orders for U.S. aircraft.

As for Johnson's attempt to expand exports to increase revenue, it is easier said than done. Currently, capitalist countries are generally experiencing production recession or stagnation, and many countries' international balances of payments are also facing crises of varying degrees. They all want to shift their overproduction crisis to other countries through expanding exports. Britain and the "Common Market" countries in Western Europe are using subsidies for exporters to expand markets abroad, while at the same time using various means to restrict the import of foreign, especially U.S., goods. Therefore, the U.S. practice of restricting the outflow of dollars and shifting the economic crisis will inevitably encounter strong opposition from other capitalist countries.

After Johnson's New Year's Day statement, the British government openly expressed concern that the already precarious British balance of payments situation would be even harder to improve, and the pound might even be further devalued. The *Guardian* on the 2nd complained that the U.S. action would harm the effect that Wilson originally hoped for, that the devaluation of the pound would promote exports. The French *Combat* on the 5th had already predicted that the "Common Market" countries were preparing to counter the U.S. restrictive measures. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach was sent to seven Western European countries to seek "support" but met with rebuffs everywhere. This shows that the U.S. plan to harm others for its own benefit is unlikely to be smoothly implemented.

The Johnson administration's "emergency measures" to rescue the dollar this time occurred when the U.S. finances were even more in a state of chaos, and the twin threats of severe domestic inflation and economic crisis were approaching. To prevent economic deterioration and eliminate foreign distrust of the dollar, the Johnson administration had to, on the one hand, continue to urge Congress to quickly pass a new tax law to reduce the huge deficit of $290 billion for the current fiscal year, and on the other hand, ask the American people to tighten their belts and "voluntarily not demand wage increases." The Johnson administration's desperate measures to rescue the dollar and its attacks on the American working people will certainly greatly intensify class contradictions in the U.S. and further promote the development of the struggle of the American people against their own imperialism.

The dollar crisis has caused great turmoil in the capitalist world. The "emergency measures" adopted by the Johnson administration to rescue the dollar crisis will certainly intensify the life-and-death struggle between Western countries in trade, finance, and currency, and promote the political and economic crises of these countries. Therefore, the dollar crisis not only reflects the weakness of U.S. imperialism but also reflects the deep-seated contradictions and impending decline of the entire imperialist camp. As our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis."

    约翰逊无法挽救美元危机
    美国总统约翰逊在今年元旦迫不及待地重申美元价值不变，并宣布采取“紧急措施”来改善美元地位。美国统治当局所以如此焦急，是因为在英镑贬值以后美元地位跟着大大恶化，抢购黄金的投机风潮猛烈冲击着美元。为了向国际市场提供黄金，稳定美元对黄金的固定比价，美国财政部在去年十二月一个月内就失掉了近十亿美元的黄金，使美国的黄金储备降到三十年来最低水平。美国政府被迫连续六次发表声明，保证美元决不贬值。参加国际“黄金总库”的一些国家也表示了对美元的“全力支持”。但是，这一切仍然不足以缓和美元危机。因此，约翰逊只好亲自出马发表声明，企图稳定人心。
    美元危机是美国国际收支亏空巨大、美国财政部拥有的黄金储备不足以应付国际市场上挤兑黄金风潮的结果。从一九五○年以来的十八年中，美国有十七年出现国际收支逆差，少则十多亿美元，多则几十亿美元，积累总数已超过三百五十亿美元以上。巨额的国际收支逆差，造成美国黄金储备的大量流失。一九四九年，美国拥有资本主义世界全部黄金百分之七十，共值二百四十五亿美元，而目前已减少到了不足一百二十亿美元。美国国际收支逆差的继续发展，必然要使美元的信用发生动摇，形成美元的严重危机。因此，约翰逊政府不能不想方设法减少今年美国的国际收支赤字。它在新年宣布的“紧急措施”，包括：用“强制性”手段来限制美国的私人海外直接投资，限制私人国外旅行，减少美国银行向国外的贷款，削减海外军费和“援”外开支，同时还要扩大出口。但是约翰逊政府的这些“紧急措施”，不会有多大实效，更不可能根本上解决美国长期存在的国际收支逆差问题。
    美国的国际收支亏空巨大，主要是美帝国主义在全世界疯狂推行侵略政策和战争政策，对其他国家加紧实行政治、经济和军事控制的结果，特别是进行侵越战争的结果。美国每年的巨额资本输出、海外军费开支和“援”外费用，远不是从贸易上赚得的几十亿美元盈余所能够抵补的。一九六四年美国贸易盈余曾达到八十一亿美元的高峰。但是这一年美国的资本输出、海外军费开支和“援”外经费等共约一百一十亿美元，结果国际收支逆差仍达二十九亿美元。由于美帝国主义顽固推行称霸世界的狂妄计划而又力不从心，约翰逊政府不可能从根本上找到消灭国际收支逆差、稳定美元信用的妙方。
    约翰逊政府把它的“节约措施”的重点，放在限制美国私人海外直接投资上。可是美国私人海外直接投资的数量却不是能够长期加以限制的。早在一九六三年约翰逊政府就曾邀请美国最大的五百家大公司和大银行老板商谈，要他们同意“自愿限制”海外投资。但是效果却很有限。到一九六七年，由于美国资本输出又大大增加，这项“自愿限制”计划就完全失败了。现在约翰逊政府想用“强制性”限制来代替“自愿限制”，也很难办得到。
    约翰逊政府减少美国“援”外开支的计划，也有很大困难。许多年来美国的对外“援助”主要用以扶植美国在世界各地的傀儡政权，势难大量削减。今年美国的“援”外拨款比去年少了几亿美元。但是，美国整个“援”外计划的实际支出大体仍将维持过去的水平。美国在各国的傀儡政权几年来一直因为得不到足够的美“援”而吵嚷不休。约翰逊如果再大幅度削减“援”外经费，美国海外的殖民势力就会更加迅速瓦解。
    约翰逊政府削减海外军费的计划，更是纸上谈兵。美国在全世界到处穷兵黩武，它的海外军费又怎能减缩得下来？美国海外军费只在侵越战争上就要支出二十多亿美元，占一九六七年美国国际收支逆差一半以上。随着世界各国人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，美帝国主义同各国人民的矛盾也越来越加剧。因此，约翰逊所谓要削减海外军费开支，纯粹是欺人之谈。
    约翰逊政府限制美国私人国外旅行以节约对外开支不过是杯水车薪，数目极为有限，况且其他国家同样可以用限制本国公民到美国旅行的办法加以报复。英法等十五个国家的航空公司已决定要研究削减对美国飞机的订货。
    至于约翰逊企图以扩大出口来开源，则是谈何容易。目前资本主义各国普遍发生生产衰退或停滞，许多国家的国际收支也出现不同程度的危机。它们都想从扩大出口中向其他国家转嫁生产过剩危机。英国和西欧“共同市场”国家就都用给出口商津贴的办法向外扩张市场，同时又用各种办法来限制外国特别是美国商品的输入。因此，美国限制美元外流、转嫁经济危机的做法，必然要遇到其他资本主义国家的强烈反对。
    在约翰逊元旦声明发表以后，英国官方公开表示担心未脱离危急状态的英国国际收支状况，将更难得到改善，英镑甚至可能要进一步贬值。《卫报》二日埋怨美国的这一行动将损害威尔逊原来期望的英镑贬值将促进出口的效果。法国《战斗报》五日已经预言“共同市场”各国正准备反击美国的限制性措施。美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫受命到西欧七国争取“支持”，到处碰壁。这说明美国损人利己的打算，是不可能顺利实现的。
    约翰逊政府这次抢救美元的“紧急措施”，是发生在美国财政更加陷于焦头烂额，国内严重的通货膨胀和经济危机威胁又双双迫近的时候。为了防止经济恶化以消除国外对美元的不信任，约翰逊政府不得不一面继续要求国会赶快通过新的增税法案，来减少本财政年度高达二百九十亿美元的巨额赤字，一面要美国人民勒紧腰带，“自动不要求提高工资”。约翰逊政府抢救美元的倒行逆施和它对美国劳动人民的进攻，必然要大大加剧美国国内的阶级矛盾，进一步促进美国人民反对本国帝国主义的斗争的发展。
    美元危机在资本主义世界已经引起了极大的混乱。约翰逊政府为挽救美元危机而采取的“紧急措施”，必然要加剧西方国家之间在贸易、金融、货币等方面的你死我活的恶战，并且促进这些国家的政治和经济危机。因此，美元危机不仅反映了美帝国主义的虚弱，同时也反映了整个帝国主义阵营的矛盾重重和日趋没落。正象我们伟大领袖毛主席早已指出的：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
