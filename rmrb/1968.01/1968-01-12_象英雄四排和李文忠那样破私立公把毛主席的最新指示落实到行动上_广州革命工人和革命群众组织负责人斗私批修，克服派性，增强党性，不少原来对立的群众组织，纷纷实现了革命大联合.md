Revolutionary workers and revolutionary mass organizations in Guangzhou have been learning from the heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have been fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, overcoming factionalism, and strengthening their Party spirit. Many previously opposing mass organizations have achieved revolutionary great unity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 10th: Revolutionary workers and leaders of revolutionary worker organizations in Guangzhou have been learning from the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong. They have been using "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as their guideline and using self-criticism as their weapon. They have been identifying the gaps between themselves and Li Wenzhong, actively attacking the selfishness in their minds, breaking selfishness to establish public spirit, and quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions.

Recently, at various report meetings and experience-sharing sessions organized by the Guangzhou Workers' Revolutionary Great Unity Preparatory Committee, many revolutionary workers and leaders of revolutionary worker organizations shared their experiences and insights from learning from Li Wenzhong. They said that learning from Li Wenzhong involves three key aspects: first, learning his unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and strictly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; second, learning his determination to expose his own shortcomings without fear, fight against selfishness without fear of pain, and change selfishness without fear of difficulty, digging out the selfishness deep in his soul; third, learning his diligence in applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions.

How can one truly learn Li Wenzhong's unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao? At the experience-sharing sessions, many revolutionary workers shared their insights. A leader from a revolutionary organization at the Guangzhou Water Plant said that by comparing himself to Li Wenzhong's shining example, he found that the main difference between them was in the character of loyalty. Li Wenzhong's loyalty to Chairman Mao is because he applies Chairman Mao's works to transform his thoughts and worldview. However, his own study of Chairman Mao's works sometimes starts from a pragmatic perspective and does not focus on transforming his worldview. This is not true loyalty to Chairman Mao. He said that to be like Li Wenzhong, one must establish an absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, which is most importantly to use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the selfishness in one's mind, break the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview, thoroughly destroying the bourgeois command center in one's mind.

Where should one start fighting selfishness? At the experience-sharing sessions, many revolutionary workers checked themselves on whether they correctly handled the situation, whether they correctly handled themselves, whether they correctly handled different viewpoints of mass organizations, and whether they correctly handled cadres. This approach has been effective.

Many revolutionary workers and leaders of revolutionary organizations deeply felt that whether one can correctly handle oneself is the touchstone of true revolution. Two textile workers from Guangzhou's First Cotton Mill shared their profound insights on how they went from misjudging themselves to correctly handling themselves. They said that one must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a thorough revolution in one's soul, fiercely fight against the bourgeois selfishness, and establish proletarian public spirit, in order to correctly handle oneself.

Whether one can correctly handle mass organizations with different viewpoints also depends on whether one has fought against selfishness. Some leaders of revolutionary worker organizations exposed at the experience-sharing sessions that in the past, due to selfishness, they had serious small-groupism and sectarianism, only seeing the shortcomings and errors of organizations with different viewpoints, and always wanting to suppress the other side. Everyone realized that this approach goes against Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao taught us: "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." At the experience-sharing sessions, everyone expressed their determination to strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be brave in self-criticism, be strict with oneself, and tolerant of others, so as to unite and carry out the Cultural Revolution well.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great unity, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. This issue must be resolved." Many revolutionary workers and leaders of revolutionary worker organizations also exposed and fought against selfishness regarding cadres at the experience-sharing sessions, determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, expand the scope of education, and unite with broad revolutionary cadres to carry out the revolution together.

At the experience-sharing sessions, many revolutionary workers expressed their determination to learn from Li Wenzhong's diligence in applying Chairman Mao's works in practice.

Through learning from the heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong's shining deeds, revolutionary workers and leaders of revolutionary organizations have greatly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened their proletarian Party spirit, significantly improved their self-criticism spirit, and many previously opposing mass organizations have achieved revolutionary great unity. Under the leadership of the working class, more and more units in Guangzhou have achieved revolutionary great unity by system, department, and class.

    象英雄四排和李文忠那样破私立公  把毛主席的最新指示落实到行动上
    广州革命工人和革命群众组织负责人斗私批修，克服派性，增强党性，不少原来对立的群众组织，纷纷实现了革命大联合
    据新华社广州十日电　广州市广大革命工人和革命工人组织的负责人，在向“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志学习的时候，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以自我批评为武器，寻找自己同李文忠同志的差距，主动向自己头脑里的私字进攻，破私立公，把毛主席的最新指示迅速地落实到自己的行动中去。
    最近，在广州工人阶级革命大联合筹备委员会举办的各种报告会、讲用会上，许多革命工人和革命工人组织的负责人介绍了他们学习李文忠同志的心得、体会。他们说，向李文忠同志学习：第一，要学习他永远忠于毛主席的忠字，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示；第二，要学习他亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，改私不怕难的决心，挖出自己灵魂深处的私字；第三，要学习他活学活用毛主席著作在用字上狠下功夫的用字，把毛主席的最新指示落实到自己的行动中去。
    怎样才能把李文忠同志永远忠于毛主席的忠字学到手？在讲用会上，许多革命工人谈了自己的体会。广州水厂一个革命组织的负责人说，以李文忠同志的光辉榜样来对照自己，比来比去，自己和李文忠同志的差距主要就差在一个忠字上。李文忠所以能够无限忠于毛主席，是因为他把活学活用毛主席著作落实到改造思想、改造世界观上。而自己学习毛主席著作，有时是从“实用主义”出发的，没有用在改造世界观上。这就不是忠于毛主席。他说，要象李文忠同志那样树立起绝对忠于毛主席的思想，最最重要的就是要用毛泽东思想大造自己头脑中私字的反，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，彻底摧毁自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部。
    斗私从那里斗起？讲用会上，许多革命工人都是通过检查自己是否正确对待形势、是否正确对待自己、是否正确对待不同观点的群众组织、是否正确对待干部等几个方面，来亮私、斗私，效果很好。
    许多革命工人和革命组织的负责人深有体会地谈到，能否正确对待自己，是真革命和假革命的试金石。广州第一棉纺织厂的两个纺织女工，在讲用会上介绍了她们从错误估计自己，到正确对待自己的深刻体会。她们说，必须用毛泽东思想为武器，在灵魂深处大闹革命，狠斗资产阶级的私字，大立无产阶级的公字，才能正确地对待自己。
    能否正确对待不同观点的群众组织，关键也在于自己是不是斗掉了私字。一些革命工人组织的负责人在讲用会上亮出了自己过去由于私字当头，小团体主义、山头主义严重，看不到自己方面的缺点、错误，只看到和自己观点不同的群众组织有缺点、错误，并且把人家的缺点、错误看死了，总想把对方压垮。大家认识到，这种做法是违背毛主席的教导的，毛主席教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”讲用会上，大家表示一定要严格遵照毛主席的这一指示办事，勇于作自我批评，严以责己，宽以待人，这样，才能团结起来，共同搞好无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”许多革命工人和革命工人组织的负责人都在讲用会上就干部问题亮私斗私，决心遵照毛主席的教导，扩大教育面，团结广大革命干部共同干革命。
    在讲用会上，许多革命工人都表示，一定要把李文忠同志活学活用毛主席著作在用字上狠下功夫的用字学到手。
    通过学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的光辉事迹，广大革命工人和革命组织的负责人大大地克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，自我批评精神显著提高，不少原来对立的群众组织，纷纷实现了革命大联合。在工人阶级的带动下，广州全市按系统、按部门、按班级实现革命大联合的单位越来越多。
