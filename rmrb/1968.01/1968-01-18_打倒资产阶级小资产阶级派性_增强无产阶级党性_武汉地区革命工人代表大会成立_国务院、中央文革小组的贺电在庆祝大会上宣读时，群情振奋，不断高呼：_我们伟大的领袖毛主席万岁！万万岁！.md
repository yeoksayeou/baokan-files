Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, amidst the thunderous battle drums of the nationwide people's struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress was formally established on January 17. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and an important sign that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is more favorable and better than ever.

On January 17, revolutionary workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers from Wuhan gathered for a grand meeting to celebrate the glorious birth of the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress. They enthusiastically hailed the revolutionary traditions of the Wuhan proletariat, who closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and consolidated and developed new victories in revolutionary unity.

The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region, including Zhang Yuxia, Liu Feng, Xu Guofu, and Zhang Hong, as well as the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Air Force, Wuhan Garrison, and Hubei Provincial Military Region, such as Xiao Qian, Fang Ming, Zhang Chunqing, and Zhang Hong, attended the meeting.

The State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress. When the responsible comrade of the Wuhan Military Region, Zhang Yuxia, read the telegram at the meeting, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the crowd enthusiastically shouted, "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletariat of Wuhan resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." They bravely fought against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei, such as Wang Renhe, and made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Today, in the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletariat of Wuhan once again demonstrated their exemplary and leading role as the main force of the revolution. They enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness," and established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Broad revolutionary workers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and the "Old Five Articles" as their weapon, thoroughly critiqued selfishness and established public spirit. They thoroughly criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and established proletarian party spirit, developing and consolidating revolutionary unity. They established a unified and revolutionary mass organization for the proletariat of the entire city—the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress, setting an example for the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and powerfully promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in Wuhan.

The meeting began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." The chairman of the meeting firmly declared that the proletariat of Wuhan, in the new year, will resolutely raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, redouble their efforts, strive to be the best, and continue to make progress. They will grasp the revolution and promote production, striving to excellently complete the five great battle tasks of 1968 and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan.

Comrade Liu Feng, the political commissar of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. He warmly congratulated the establishment of the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress and pointed out that in the new year, we must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, continue to establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He called on all revolutionary mass organizations to rectify themselves in thought and organization, raise awareness, purify the ranks, affirm achievements, overcome shortcomings, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, unite as one, and fight the enemy together, creating new merits in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Air Force, Wuhan Garrison, and Hubei Provincial Military Region, such as Xiao Qian, Zhang Chunqing, and Zhang Hong, also spoke at the meeting, expressing their warm congratulations and firm support for the congress.

Representatives from the Wuhan Region Red Guards' High School and Middle School Congress also attended to offer their congratulations. They expressed their determination to learn from the proletariat, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the revolution in education, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the meeting, many revolutionary workers from various factories and enterprises in Wuhan held up portraits of Chairman Mao and red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," bringing in big red congratulatory messages to report their joy.
