The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a major obstacle to the further development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great enemy to the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It must be resolutely overthrown.

The ability of a leader of a revolutionary mass organization to consciously overcome factionalism is a severe test of whether they can continue to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the process of eliminating factionalism and achieving great unity in our factory, I have experienced many intense struggles.

I was originally a leader of the "East is Red" organization. In the past, we had a serious confrontation with another revolutionary mass organization in the factory, the "Red Rebels," and the contradictions were sharp. After the support team from the 8341 Unit entered the factory, they helped us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the contradictions between the two factions gradually eased.

On September 14th last year, the newspaper published Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." All revolutionary workers in the factory immediately responded to the great leader's call and proposed to achieve great unity.

At that time, I realized: achieving great unity is Chairman Mao's great command, and it should be executed. However, factionalism had not been completely eliminated.

When the comrades from the "Red Rebels" came to us with drums and gongs to deliver a proposal for great unity on the evening of September 19th, I had a fierce struggle in my heart. Should we accept the proposal? Accepting it would mean agreeing to immediate unity, which would be like abandoning the original "revolutionary principles" we had insisted on. What kind of reaction would this cause? Moreover, the leader of the opposing side was someone we had strongly opposed and vowed to remove from power! Not accepting it would mean not executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions! What should I do?

In the end, a powerful thought prevailed: we revolutionaries of the proletariat rose up to make revolution by listening to Chairman Mao's words; now, we cannot disobey Chairman Mao's orders and deviate from the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao! Since Chairman Mao calls for achieving great unity, we cannot consider the interests of one faction and not strive for great unity. I must always listen to Chairman Mao's words and always follow Chairman Mao, never engaging in half-hearted revolution!

With this in mind, I went forward and resolutely accepted the proposal, shaking hands firmly with the leader of the opposing side. Later, someone praised us: "The handshake between the leaders of the two factions has determined the overall situation of the Beijing Knitting Factory." I thought that at that time, if I had become a captive of factionalism and refused to accept the proposal from the "Red Rebels," then I would have been the culprit obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our factory!

After the news of achieving great unity spread, all revolutionary workers in the factory were overjoyed. However, a few revolutionary comrades could not immediately understand. They mistakenly thought that uniting without resolving specific issues was "compromising." Some blamed me for being "rightist," "surrendering," "not principled," and "being a traitor." Faced with this situation, what should I do? Should I proceed firmly according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, or should I stop here or even retreat?

I sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works. "Often, the broad masses outstrip us and urgently need to advance a step further, but our comrades cannot be the leaders of the broad masses; instead, they reflect the opinions of a section of backward elements and mistakenly regard these backward elements' opinions as the opinions of the broad masses, becoming the tail of the backward elements." Chairman Mao's teaching strengthened my resolve to continue advancing.

I believe that those few comrades who temporarily could not keep up with the situation would eventually understand. Because we are acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, in line with the direction of the revolutionary struggle. I am the leader of "East is Red," and more than 800 revolutionary comrades trust me. I cannot lead them astray but must lead them onto the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. If I had indulged this section of comrades today, continued to engage in factionalism, and not executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it would not only be detrimental to the revolution but also these comrades would be dissatisfied with us in the future.

I also had concerns: would my actions cause me to lose touch with the masses? Later, I realized: only by closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can one truly not lose touch with the masses. Because Chairman Mao's strategic deployment concentrates the revolutionary interests of the proletariat and represents the will of the broadest masses. On the contrary, if one is blinded by factionalism, engages in factional disputes, and does not closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, one will definitely lose touch with the masses and be abandoned by the revolutionary masses of one's own organization and other organizations!

Later facts also proved that I did not lose touch with the masses because of this. Those who originally did not agree with our actions now also think we did the right thing.

These comrades' opinions also made me consider this question: why do these comrades have such strong factionalism? Ultimately, it is because our leaders built "mountaintops" and instilled factionalism. Thinking of this, I did not blame them for raising these issues but instead resolved to do ideological work with them, helping them to overcome factionalism and resolutely execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions together.

Chairman Mao teaches us: do not rely on past merits! Strive for new achievements! In the current struggle to eliminate factionalism and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we leaders of revolutionary mass organizations should strive to be models.

    革命群众组织负责人面临的严峻考验
    北京针织总厂革命委员会副主任　贺根林
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是无产阶级文化大革命进一步发展的极大障碍，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的大敌，必须坚决把它打倒。
    一个革命群众组织的负责人，能不能自觉地克服派性，是能不能继续紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的一场严峻考验。
    在我们厂破除派性，实现革命大联合的过程中，我就经历过多次激烈的思想斗争。
    我原是“东方红”的负责人。过去，我们和厂里另一个革命群众组织“红色造反者”严重对立，矛盾很尖锐。八三四一部队支左人员进厂以后，大力帮助我们活学活用毛主席著作，两派矛盾才逐步缓和下来。
    去年九月十四日，报上发表了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”全厂广大革命职工立即响应伟大领袖的号召，纷纷倡议实现革命的大联合。
    当时，我认识到：革命的大联合，是毛主席的伟大号令，应当执行。但是，派性还没有完全消除。
    当九月十九日晚上，“红色造反者”的同志敲锣打鼓给我们送来实现革命大联合的倡议书时，我心里斗争很激烈。倡议书接不接？接吧，就是同意立即联合，等于放弃了原来坚持的“革命原则”，这会引起什么反应？何况对方领队的，是我们曾经极力反对，声言要把他拉下台的同志！不接呢？就是不执行毛主席的最新指示！怎么办？
    最后，一股强有力的思想占了上风：我们无产阶级革命派，是听毛主席的话，起来闹革命的；如今，可不能不听毛主席的号令，离开毛主席指引的革命轨道！毛主席既然号召我们实现革命大联合，我们就不能考虑一派的利害，不去搞大联合。我应当永远听毛主席的话，永远跟毛主席走，绝不能搞半截革命！
    想到这里，我迎了上去，毅然决然地接过倡议书，和对方的负责人紧紧握手。后来，有人称赞我们：“你们两派负责人这次握手，定了针织总厂的大局。”我倒是想，当时，我如果做了派性的俘虏，拒绝接受“红色造反者”的倡议书，那末，我就会是阻挠我们厂落实毛主席最新指示的罪人！
    实现革命大联合的喜讯传开以后，全厂广大革命职工欢欣鼓舞。有少数革命群众一时转不过弯来。他们误认为，对某些具体问题没争个水落石出就联合，那是“凑合”。有人责怪我“右倾”，“投降”，“不讲原则”，“当了叛徒”。面对这种情况，怎么办？是坚定不移地按照毛主席指引的航向前进呢？还是就此止步，或者走回头路？
    我向毛主席著作去求教。“许多时候，广大群众跑到我们的前头去了，迫切地需要前进一步了，我们的同志不能做广大群众的领导者，却反映了一部分落后分子的意见，并且将这种落后分子的意见误认为广大群众的意见，做了落后分子的尾巴。”毛主席这一教导，坚定了我继续前进的决心。
    我相信，少数一时跟不上形势的同志，目前对我们的作法不理解，将来一定会理解。因为我们是按照毛主席的最新指示去做的，是符合革命斗争大方向的。我是“东方红”的头头，八百多革命群众信任我，我就不能把他们往邪路上带，只能往毛主席指引的革命轨道上带。如果今天迁就了这部分同志，继续闹派性，不执行毛主席的最新指示，不但对革命不利，将来这些同志醒悟过来，也会对我们不满的。
    我也曾有过担心：我这样做，会不会脱离群众？后来，我想通了：只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，才能真正不脱离群众。因为毛主席的战略部署集中体现了无产阶级的革命利益，集中代表了最广大人民群众的意志。反过来，如果让派性迷了心窍，一心闹派别纠纷，不紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，那就一定会脱离群众，为本组织和其他组织的广大革命群众所抛弃！
    后来的事实也证明，我并没有因此而脱离群众。原来不赞成我们的作法的，现在也认为我们做得对了。
    这些同志提的意见，还促使我考虑这样一个问题：为什么这些同志有这样强烈的派性？归根到底，还是我们头头修“山头”、灌派性所造成的。想到这些，我便不责怪他们提意见，而是下决心去对他们做思想工作，帮助他们共同克服派性，一起坚决执行毛主席的最新指示。
    毛主席教导我们：不要吃老本！要立新功！在当前破除派性、全面落实毛主席的最新指示的斗争中，我们革命群众组织的负责人，应当力争做模范。
