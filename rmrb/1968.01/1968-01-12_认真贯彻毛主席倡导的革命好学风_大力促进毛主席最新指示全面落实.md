The Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing have been helping local units to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They are seriously implementing the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao and promoting the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Over 20,000 study classes of various forms have been held, with more than 1.5 million people participating in the study. This has greatly promoted the Cultural Revolution in various units.

New China News Agency, January 11th: The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing have, since last October, been helping factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools to organize various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have been adhering to the principle of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism through self-criticism" and have organized over 20,000 study classes of various forms, with more than 1.5 million people participating in the study. In these study classes, the soldiers and officers have helped the participants to establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to make Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and specific policies understood by the broad masses of the people. This has fundamentally raised the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary masses and ensured that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances victoriously along the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao. Their main experiences in helping the study classes to establish a revolutionary study style are as follows:

	1. First, to lay the ideological foundation for establishing a revolutionary study style

	Only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can one consciously and resolutely carry out all of Chairman Mao's instructions. The soldiers and officers, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly organized the masses to study Vice Chairman Lin's most comprehensive, correct, and scientific evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Through various forms and at every opportunity, they emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, that Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our era, and that it is the guiding principle for all work of the Party, the army, and the country. In this way, they helped everyone to deeply understand that the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line and touchstone between revolution and counter-revolution, between genuine revolution and pseudo-revolution, and between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. Whether to study Chairman Mao's books, whether to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and whether to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions are not ordinary matters but major principles concerning whether or not to make a revolution.

	Many study classes, through class education, reminiscences, and family histories, extolled Chairman Mao's great deeds, denounced and criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, and greatly aroused everyone's infinite love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Many study classes also, through personal growth stories, the glorious achievements of socialist construction, the great victories of the Chinese revolution, the vigorous development of the world revolution, and especially the unprecedented great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praised Chairman Mao's great wisdom and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. This helped everyone to clearly understand that Chairman Mao's instructions reflect the demands of the times, concentrate the highest wisdom of the masses, represent the fundamental interests of the working class and the broad masses of laboring people, and are the highest commands that all revolutionaries must resolutely carry out. In this way, the broad participants fundamentally established the correct attitude: to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions when they are understood, and to carry them out even when they are not yet understood, deepening understanding through practice. They did this by strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions, step by step, fighting for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line while alive, and dedicating their lives to it when dead.

	Through a series of such activities, the broad revolutionary masses greatly enhanced their consciousness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, laying a solid ideological foundation for establishing a revolutionary study style.

	2. To link theory with practice, focusing on the "use" of Mao Zedong Thought

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The close and indissoluble connection between knowledge and practice, this characteristic of Marxism, has no equal in the history of philosophy." The most important thing in establishing a revolutionary study style is to link theory with practice, using Mao Zedong Thought as the arrow to hit the target of current revolutionary struggles.

	In the process of helping various units to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the soldiers and officers, based on the situation, tasks, and actual struggles of each period, as well as the thoughts of the masses, determined the content of the study classes. Whatever is the key to the current movement, the study classes study that; whatever are the most prominent, concentrated, sharp, and complex contradictions in the current movement, those are the key points that the study classes need to solve. For example, before and after achieving revolutionary great unity, they mobilized the participants to strive to use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism; before and after achieving revolutionary "three-in-one combination," they focused on helping cadres to correctly treat the masses, to correctly treat themselves, and also to help the masses to correctly treat cadres, implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The soldiers and officers especially paid attention to guiding everyone to consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism, to carry out revolution in the depths of their souls, to dare to expose their private thoughts without fear of shame, and to dare to criticize themselves without fear of pain, planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought deep in their souls.

	3. To carry out serious self-criticism and consciously correct mistakes

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether or not there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent features that distinguish us from other parties." To establish a revolutionary study style, it is necessary to advocate serious self-criticism in the study classes. The soldiers and officers felt that the most powerful ideological weapon for carrying out serious self-criticism is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres listen most to Chairman Mao's words and are most willing to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. As long as Mao Zedong Thought is used to arm the masses, the masses will consciously rise up to carry out self-revolution and seriously carry out self-criticism. They seriously organized the masses to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, and each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving minor differences," inspiring everyone to use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to look at themselves. While affirming the correct aspects of themselves, they bravely faced their own shortcomings and errors. In this way, they raised the consciousness of self-criticism among the participants, making the study classes a place where everyone strictly demands of themselves and carries out serious, not perfunctory, self-criticism.

	The soldiers and officers also brought a set of lively and vivid methods from the army's political work to the study classes, such as exchanging Chairman Mao's quotations, giving cadres hope, and challenging each other. The participants reflected that carrying out self-criticism in the study classes, raising problems for themselves, and finding answers in Chairman Mao's works made them feel relaxed, solved problems thoroughly, understood problems deeply, and achieved solid results.

	The soldiers and officers also used the method of leading by example to promote the masses to carry out self-criticism. Exemplary figures speaking from personal experience made a deep impression on the masses, who accepted it quickly. Many study classes used the method of leading by example to promote self-criticism.

	On the basis of carrying out serious self-criticism, it is also necessary to advocate sincere mutual help. They always used the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to solve contradictions among the masses in the study classes. The main form of mutual help among the participants was to carry out heart-to-heart talks. Everyone used every opportunity to talk to each other, becoming closer and more intimate with each talk.

	4. The left-supporting personnel must set a good example and take the lead in establishing a revolutionary study style

	In helping the masses to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the soldiers and officers always paid attention to leading by example, setting a good example, and consistently grasping and taking the lead in establishing the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao. To do this, they must first place themselves among the masses, be good students of the masses; they must study with the masses, carry out self-criticism with the masses, criticize and repudiate revisionism with the masses, truly becoming both propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and fighters in the struggle against revisionism, as well as good students of the proletarian revolutionary line. Many soldiers and officers, together with the broad masses, practiced the "five together": studying Chairman Mao's works together, exposing their thoughts together, criticizing their private thoughts together, criticizing revisionism together, and holding lectures and application meetings together. They brought a set of effective methods from the army for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works into the study classes, setting a living example for establishing a revolutionary study style and for the thought revolutionization of the broad masses. In leading the way in self-criticism, many comrades actively went to the masses to solicit their opinions, especially actively seeking opinions from those who had more criticisms, having heart-to-heart talks, exposing their private thoughts, and sincerely accepting the masses' criticisms. The exemplary actions of the soldiers and officers powerfully promoted the smooth progress of the struggle against revisionism.

    北京卫戍区和驻京部队指战员帮助地方办好毛泽东思想学习班
    认真贯彻毛主席倡导的革命好学风大力促进毛主席最新指示全面落实
    举办了两万多个各种形式的学习班，有一百五十多万人参加学习，极大地推动了各单位的文化大革命
    新华社十一日讯　人民解放军北京卫戍区和驻京部队广大指战员，在帮助工厂、农村、机关、学校举办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班中，认真贯彻伟大领袖毛主席倡导的革命好学风，促进了毛主席最新指示的落实，极大地推动了各单位的无产阶级文化大革命。
    人民解放军北京卫戍区和驻京部队指战员，去年十月以来，以“斗私，批修”为纲，协助地方举办了两万多个各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，有一百五十多万人参加了学习。在这些学习班里，指战员们认真帮助学员建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策，为广大人民群众所掌握，从根本上提高了革命群众的毛泽东思想水平，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的革命航道胜利前进。他们帮助学习班学员建立革命好学风的主要经验是：
        一，首先要为建立革命的好学风
    奠定思想基础
    只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，才能自觉地坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一切指示，才能对毛主席的指示，学了就用，学用结合，立竿见影。指战员们在毛泽东思想学习班里，不断组织群众反复学习林副主席对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的最全面、最正确、最科学的评价。通过各种形式，利用一切时机，大讲特讲毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜，是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。这样，使大家更加深刻地认识到，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的态度，是区别革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭和试金石。对毛主席的书学不学，对毛主席的话听不听，对毛主席的指示执行不执行，不是一般的问题，而是要不要革命的重大原则问题。
    许多学习班，通过阶级教育、回忆对比、讲家史等方法，大颂特颂毛主席的恩情，控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行，大大激发了大家对毛主席的无限热爱，加深了对党内一小撮走资派的无比仇恨。许多学习班还通过摆个人的成长，社会主义建设的辉煌成就，中国革命的伟大胜利，世界革命的蓬勃发展，特别是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利，大谈毛主席的英明伟大，大谈毛泽东思想的无比威力，从而使大家更加清楚地认识到，毛主席的指示反映了时代的要求，集中了群众的最高智慧，代表了工人阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，是一切革命者必须坚决执行的最高命令。这样，广大学员就从根本上树立了唯一正确的态度：对于毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，从执行中加深理解。做到句句照办，步步紧跟，生为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身。
    通过这样一系列的活动，大大增强了广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性，为树立革命的好学风奠定了牢固的思想基础。
        二，理论联系实际，在“用”字
    上狠下功夫
    毛主席教导我们：“理论和实践这样密切地相结合，是我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的显著标志之一。”建立革命的好学风，最重要的，就是理论联系实际，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射当前革命斗争实践之“的”。
    指战员们在帮助各单位的革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班的过程中，根据各个时期的形势、任务、本单位的斗争实际和群众的活思想，确定学习班的学习内容。当前运动的关键是什么，学习班就学什么；当前运动中矛盾最突出、最集中、最尖锐、最复杂的那些问题，就是学习班需要解决的重点。例如，在实现革命大联合的前后，发动学员努力用毛泽东思想克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性；实现革命“三结合”前后，重点帮助干部正确对待群众，正确对待自己，也帮助群众正确对待干部，执行毛主席的干部政策。指战员们特别重视根据学员在当前斗争中的活思想，引导大家自觉地用毛泽东思想破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，做到亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插在灵魂深处。
        三，进行认真的自我批评，自觉
    地改正缺点错误
    毛主席教导我们：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”要建立革命好学风，就必须在学习班上提倡认真的自我批评。指战员们体会到，开展认真的自我批评，最强大的思想武器是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。广大革命群众和革命干部最听毛主席的话，最愿照毛主席的指示办事，只要用毛泽东思想武装群众，群众就会自觉地起来自我革命，认真进行自我批评。他们认真组织群众活学活用“老三篇”，反复学习毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示，启发大家运用一分为二的观点来看待自己。在肯定自己正确方面的同时，勇敢地正视自己的缺点和错误。这样，就提高了学员自我批评的自觉性，使学习班出现了人人严格要求自己，实行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评的局面。
    指战员们还把互相送毛主席语录，给干部提希望，互相挑应战等部队政治工作中一套生动活泼的做法带到学习班，为开展自我批评造成浓厚的空气。学员们反映说，在学习班上开展自我批评，自己提问题，自己从毛主席著作里找答案，心情舒畅，解决问题彻底，认识问题深刻，取得的成效巩固。
    指战员们还采用典型带动一般的方法，推动群众开展自我批评。典型人物现身说法，群众看得见，印象深，接受快。很多学习班都是运用典型带动一般的方法，来推动自我批评的开展。
    在进行认真自我批评的基础上，还要提倡进行真诚的互相帮助。他们在学习班里始终运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式来解决群众之间的矛盾。学员们互相帮助的主要形式是开展谈心活动。大家利用一切时间找对方谈心，结果越谈越亲近，越谈越贴心。
        四，支左人员要做好样子，带头
    建立革命好学风
    指战员们在帮助群众举办毛泽东思想学习班中，处处注意言传身带，以身作则，自始至终狠抓和带头建立毛主席倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。这样做，就首先要把自己置身于群众之中，当好群众的小学生；必须和群众一块学习，一块开展自我批评，一块斗私批修，真正做到既是毛泽东思想的宣传员，斗私批修的战斗员，又是无产阶级革命派的好学员。很多指战员和广大群众一起实行五同：同学毛主席著作，同亮思想，同斗私心，同批修正主义，同开讲用会，把部队活学活用毛主席著作的一套行之有效的方法带进学习班，为学习班建立革命的好学风，为广大群众思想革命化树立了活榜样。在带头进行自我批评中，很多同志主动到群众中去，征求群众的意见，特别是主动找意见多的群众谈心、交心、亮私心，诚恳接受群众的批评。指战员们的模范行动，有力地促进了斗私批修的顺利开展。
