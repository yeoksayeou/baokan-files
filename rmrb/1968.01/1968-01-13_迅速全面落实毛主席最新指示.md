The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting on January 11, the first anniversary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group's congratulatory telegram to Shanghai's revolutionary rebel organizations. This day also marks the first anniversary of the great "January Revolution." On this joyous occasion, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee called on the city's proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people to continue to carry forward the spirit of the "January Revolution," to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to strive to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the expanded meeting, proletarian revolutionary comrades from various fronts reviewed the battle course since the "January Revolution," summarizing experiences, building on achievements, correcting shortcomings, and discussing the current situation and tasks with a view to future battles. They made several new decisions for the next phase of work.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao and other leading members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee attended the meeting. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao spoke at the meeting.

The comrades attending the meeting, filled with boundless love and reverence for the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically declared that in the past battles, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who guided us step by step. Every victory we achieved was the result of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The meeting hall repeatedly echoed with the slogans, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Comrades from various fronts unanimously agreed that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, like that in the rest of the country, is excellent and getting better. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are being gradually implemented. A mass movement centered on "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is flourishing. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering the urban and suburban counties. Especially in recent times, the intensive study of Chairman Mao's great theory of party building and the thorough criticism of the revisionist line of party building by the Chinese Khrushchev have powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts. The city has basically achieved revolutionary great unity. Most units have established revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs. Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness" has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Everyone said in their speeches that our work still falls short of Chairman Mao's expectations for us and the requirements put forward by the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram last year. We must redouble our efforts and strive for new victories in the battle for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1968.

The meeting believed: The central task at present is to quickly and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Different units and departments should, according to the actual situation of the movement's development, resolutely act in accordance with Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. Those areas, counties, bureaus, important factories, enterprises, schools, and other grassroots units that have not yet achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination should strive to achieve revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination before and after the Spring Festival, to welcome the first anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee with new victories. Units that have already established revolutionary committees should take up the work of rectifying and building the party, and rectifying and purging the class ranks.

"The ship of the great ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The meeting emphasized that using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner is the most important matter. The first condition for the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize power is to seize the power to study and popularize Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting requires all fronts in the city to carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, and to establish a revolutionary academic style of linking theory with practice. We must continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on all fronts.

The meeting requires the organs of dictatorship to rely on the masses, strengthen the dictatorship of the masses, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely suppress all sabotage activities by class enemies.

The meeting requires that before and after the Spring Festival, we should further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "supporting the army and loving the people," mobilize revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers and officers to seriously review, revise, and implement the covenants on supporting the army and loving the people, and further strengthen military-civilian unity.

The meeting pointed out: All kinds of schools at all levels should, according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution thought, resume classes and make revolution. The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff should firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, eliminate all interference, and according to the spirit of teaching while reforming, fully mobilize the masses, do a good job of investigation and research and typical experiments, and fight a few brilliant battles in the educational revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The meeting requires comrades on all fronts to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production," and do various works better, faster, and more economically.

The meeting discussed and studied the issue of improving leadership style. The meeting pointed out that all levels of leadership must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "be both an official and a common person." They should often return to their original units to participate in labor and maintain close contact with the masses. They should better go among the masses and among the actual conditions, improve the relationship between superiors and subordinates, consult with the masses on matters, be good students of the masses, be good at discovering and supporting new things among the masses. They should further carry forward the spirit of the "January Revolution," be daring and humble, and do the work more thoroughly and meticulously.

The meeting requires all units to, according to the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao conveyed in the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, combine with the specific situation of their units, make a work plan to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions before May Day. All levels of leadership must guard against arrogance, humbly learn from advanced units, find the gaps, redouble their efforts, strive to catch up, and continue to strive for new victories. Let the banner of the "January Revolution" fly high and forever fly high!

    新华社上海十二日电　一月十一日，是中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体贺电发布一周年，是伟大的“一月革命”一周年纪念日。在这个大喜日子里，上海市革命委员会举行了扩大会议，号召全市无产阶级革命派和革命人民，继续发扬“一月革命”精神，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。
    在扩大会议上，来自各条战线上的无产阶级革命派同志回顾了“一月革命”以来的战斗历程，本着总结经验，发扬成绩，改正缺点，以利再战的精神，畅谈了当前的形势和任务，对下一阶段的工作作出了若干新的决定。
    张春桥同志和上海市革命委员会其他领导成员出席了会议。张春桥同志在会上讲了话。
    出席会议的同志，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和无限崇敬的感情，满怀激情地说，在过去的战斗中，是伟大领袖毛主席指引着我们一步一步前进，我们每一个胜利的取得，都是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的结果，都是贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的结果。会场里，一次又一次地响起“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。
    来自各条战线上的同志在发言中一致认为，当前上海无产阶级文化大革命形势和全国一样，一片大好，越来越好。毛主席的一系列最新指示正在逐步地落实。一个以“斗私，批修”为中心的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动蓬勃兴起，毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及市区和郊区各县。特别是最近以来对毛主席的伟大建党学说的大学习和对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的大批判，更有力地推动了各条战线斗、批、改的深入开展。全市基本上实现了革命的大联合。大部分单位建立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构。毛主席
  “抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召深入人心。大家在发言中说，我们的工作同毛主席对我们的期望，同中央去年贺电对我们提出的要求，距离还很远，必须鼓足干劲，再接再厉，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗的一九六八年中立新功。
    会议认为：当前全市任务中心的中心，就是要迅速地、切实地全面落实毛主席的最新指示。不同单位、不同部门应根据运动发展的实际情况，坚决按照毛主席的有关指示办事。尚未实现革命大联合和革命三结合的部分区、县、局，重要的工厂企业、学校和其他基层单位，要力争在春节前后实现革命大联合和革命三结合，以新的胜利迎接上海市革命委员会成立一周年。已经建立了革命委员会的单位，应当把整党建党、整顿清理阶级队伍等项工作抓起来。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。会议强调指出：用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，是头等重要的大事。无产阶级革命派掌权，第一条就是掌学习毛泽东思想、普及毛泽东思想的权。会议要求全市各条战线要更加广泛和深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，树立理论联系实际的革命学风。要继续深入开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线在各条战线上的流毒。
    会议要求专政机关坚决依靠群众，加强群众的专政，提高革命警惕性，坚决镇压一切阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    会议要求在春节前后进一步贯彻毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大指示，发动革命群众和人民解放军指战员，认真检查、修订和落实拥军爱民公约，进一步增强军民团结。
    会议指出：各类各级学校都要根据毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想，复课闹革命。红卫兵小将和革命的教职员工，要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除一切干扰，根据边教学、边改革的精神，充分发动群众，做好调查研究和典型试验工作，在教育革命中打几场漂亮仗。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”会议要求各条战线上的同志要坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，把各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。
    会议讨论研究了改进领导作风问题。会议指出，各级领导一定要遵照毛主席的教导，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。要经常回原单位参加劳动，同群众保持密切的联系。要更好地深入群众，深入实际，搞好上下级关系，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生，善于发现和支持群众中的新生事物。要进一步发扬“一月革命”的精神，既要敢字当头，又要谦虚谨慎，把工作做得更为深入细致。
    会议要求各单位都要根据《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论所传达的我们伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，结合本单位的具体情况，作出“五·一”节前落实毛主席最新指示的工作规划。各级领导都要力戒骄傲，虚心向先进单位学习，找出差距，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗，让“一月革命”的旗帜高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
