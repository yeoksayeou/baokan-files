Recently, Nguyen Van Quang, who attended the Second Conference of Heroes and Model Soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam and was awarded the title of "Hero of the People's Liberation Armed Forces," is a renowned anti-American hero from the Eastern Region of South Vietnam. This fearless commander of the local militia machine gun squad in Ba Dia Province, in one battle, was left alone and wounded, but he still fought bravely, engaging a large number of American and Australian mercenary troops, killing over a hundred enemies, and effectively supporting the operations of brother units, achieving remarkable feats.

In May 1966, the American aggressors, unwilling to accept the heavy defeat of their so-called "dry season strategic counteroffensive," gathered more than 8,500 American troops and mercenaries to launch a "sweep" in the areas of Cuu Long, Ba Dia, and Long Phu, in a desperate struggle.

This enemy force, after merging, launched a surprise attack at dawn. The enemy's shells and bombs fell like rain around the old and new rubber plantations, but not a single shell or bomb was dropped on the two rubber plantations. It was clear that the enemy intended to drive the People's Liberation Armed Forces into the rubber plantations to "surround and annihilate" them.

At noon, the enemy began their attack on the new rubber plantation. As soon as they approached the edge of the pineapple grove near the new rubber plantation, they were met with sniper fire from the guerrillas. The enemy then split into three columns to attack the pineapple grove.

At this time, the command of the liberation army decided to send Nguyen Van Quang and his machine gun squad to support the brother units in battle.

Nguyen Van Quang and his two comrades, Anh Trung and Anh Quyet, formed a machine gun squad that had been tempered in countless battles. They were already prepared for combat and immediately rushed to the battlefield upon receiving the order.

Nguyen Van Quang and his comrades advanced towards the direction of the heaviest gunfire. Nguyen Van Quang, carrying the heavy machine gun, ran at the forefront. Suddenly, he noticed a group of enemy soldiers about ten meters to his left. Without hesitation, Nguyen Van Quang turned around and fired his fully loaded machine gun, while Anh Trung used his submachine gun to mow down the enemy. After a brief but accurate burst of fire, more than thirty American soldiers lay dead on the ground.

The first battle was victorious, and Nguyen Van Quang and his two comrades continued to advance. Suddenly, another group of American soldiers charged towards them. Nguyen Van Quang immediately picked up his machine gun and fired a barrage at the enemy, pushing them back, and then charged towards the enemy. At this moment, Anh Quyet unfortunately fell, hit by a bullet. Before his last breath, this loyal soldier still remembered to encourage his comrades to fight bravely to the end. Seeing his comrade, like a brother, taken by the enemy, Nguyen Van Quang and Anh Trung's hearts burned with rage, determined to avenge their fallen comrade. Nguyen Van Quang and Anh Trung, with renewed courage, charged into the enemy ranks, capturing a heavy machine gun and a mortar. They continued their advance, reaching the enemy's command post.

The battle continued until four in the afternoon, when Anh Trung also unfortunately fell. The entire squad was left with only Nguyen Van Quang. With a heavy heart, he picked up the machine gun, which had its tripod blown off, and a box of ammunition, charging towards a hill near the bushes, killing many more enemies. At this moment, Nguyen Van Quang was hit in the waist by a bullet. But facing the large enemy force, his only thought was: as long as I am still alive, I will continue to fight; I will fight harder and kill more enemies!

The American soldiers, relying on their numerical superiority, shouted and screamed, tightening their encirclement from all sides. But the clever and brave Nguyen Van Quang used the terrain to his advantage, fighting and breaking out of the encirclement.

When Nguyen Van Quang approached the dike, it was already dark. Under the light of the enemy's flares, Nguyen Van Quang discovered more than twenty enemy soldiers moving towards the dike, trembling with fear. He decided to eliminate this group of enemies, using the dike to cover himself, and when the enemies came close, he suddenly opened fire, killing all of them. Then another group of American soldiers surrounded him. Nguyen Van Quang had only seven bullets left, but he remained calm, shooting down several enemies, causing the rest to flee in panic.

Nguyen Van Quang finally, after killing a large number of enemies and effectively supporting the brother units, broke through the enemy's encirclement and returned to his unit.

Nguyen Van Quang comes from a poor peasant family. His parents were killed by the enemy during the anti-French war. From a young age, he suffered under the oppression and exploitation of the landlords. The revolution saved him from deep suffering. Class bitterness and national hatred inspired this young soldier to fight bravely for national liberation and the independence of the motherland, thus achieving glorious feats in the great war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

    歼美英雄浑身是胆  冲锋陷阵痛歼豺狼
    ——记南越南部东区著名歼美英雄阮文光的显赫战功
    不久以前出席越南南方人民解放武装力量第二届英模勇士大会，并荣获“人民解放武装力量英雄”的光荣称号的阮文光，是南部东区著名的歼美英雄。这位英勇无比的巴地省地方部队机枪组组长，在一次战斗中全组只剩下他一个人，而且负了伤，但他仍然孤胆作战，同大批美军和澳大利亚帮凶军激战，歼灭敌人上百名，有力地配合了兄弟单位作战，立下了显赫战功。
    一九六六年五月，不甘心于第一次所谓“旱季战略反攻”的惨重失败的美国强盗，纠集了八千五百多名美军和帮凶军，在球江、巴地、隆福等地区展开“扫荡”，进行挣扎。
    这股敌人会合后，在凌晨突然发动进攻。敌人的炮弹和炸弹如雨点一般集中地落在新、老两个橡胶林的周围，而对这两个橡胶林却不投一弹，不发一炮。很明显，敌人妄图把人民解放武装力量逼进橡胶林里，以便“聚而歼之”。
    晌午，敌人开始向新橡胶林发起攻击。他们刚接近新橡胶林边缘的菠萝蜜林，就遭到游击队的狙击。于是敌人便分兵三路向菠萝蜜林展开进攻。
    这时候，解放军指挥部决定派阮文光带领他的机枪组前往支援兄弟单位作战。
    阮文光和副射手阿仲以及弹药手阿决三人组成的机枪组，是在战斗中经过千锤百炼的一个坚强的战斗集体。他们早已作好了战斗准备，一接到命令，便立即冲向战场。
    阮文光同战友们向枪声最密集的方向挺进。阮文光扛着重机枪飞跑在最前面。突然发现在左翼约十米远的地方，有一群鬼子冲过来。阮文光不慌不忙地转过身来扣动上满子弹的机枪射击，阿仲也用冲锋枪向敌人猛烈扫射。在一阵短促而准确的扫射过后，三十多个美军枕藉地躺倒在地上。
    首战告捷，阮文光和两位战友继续前进。忽然，迎面又有一群美国鬼子冲来，阮文光立即拿起机枪猛烈地对敌人扫了一阵，把敌人压了下去，并向敌人冲锋过去，这时，阿决不幸中弹倒下。牺牲前，这位忠诚的战士还念念不忘鼓励战友英勇杀敌，战斗到底。看着骨肉般的战友被敌人夺去了生命，阮文光和阿仲胸中燃起了万丈怒火，下决心要为牺牲的战友报仇。阮文光和阿仲勇气百倍地冲进敌阵，缴获了一挺重机枪和一门迫击炮。他俩乘胜一直冲到敌人的指挥部。
    战斗延续到下午四时，阿仲也不幸牺牲了，全组只剩下阮文光一人。他怀着悲愤的心情，一手提起那挺被炸断了脚架的机枪，一手提着子弹箱，奋不顾身地冲向树丛边的一个土丘上，一连又打死了许多敌人。就在这个时候，阮文光的腰部中弹受了伤。但面对着大群的敌人，他唯一的想法是：只要还有我一个人，我就一定要坚持战斗下去；一定要更狠地打，更多地歼灭敌人！
    美国鬼子依仗人多势众，大喊大叫，从四面缩紧包围圈。但机智勇敢的阮文光，利用有利的地形，边战斗边突围。
    阮文光冲近堤坝时，天已漆黑。在敌人发射的照明弹的光亮下，阮文光发现二十多名鬼子正胆颤心惊地朝着堤坝的方向移动。他决心收拾这批敌人，便利用堤坝掩护着自己，等敌人走近时，突然开枪扫射，把这批敌人全部歼灭。随后又有一批美国鬼子围了过来。阮文光只剩下七颗子弹了，但他十分镇静，他接连打倒几个敌人，其余敌人吓得惊惶逃窜了。
    阮文光终于在消灭大量的敌人，有力地支援了兄弟单位后胜利地突破了敌人的包围，回到了部队。
    阮文光出身于一个贫苦的农民家庭，父母在抗法战争中惨遭敌人杀害。他自幼受尽地主的压迫和剥削，革命把他从深重的苦难中解救出来。阶级苦，民族恨，激励着这位年青的战士赤胆忠心为民族解放和祖国的独立而勇猛杀敌，从而为伟大的抗美救国战争立下了辉煌的战功。　（新华社河内电）
