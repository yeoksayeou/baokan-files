Guangdong Province Widely Establishes Various Types of Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes to Effectively Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 29th. Since its establishment, the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group has always placed the propagation, study, implementation, and realization of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position that is higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They have regarded the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a crucial measure for the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and for the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. From mid-October last year to the present, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held in all parts of the province and in various units. Over 3.3 million revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and cadres have participated in these classes. They have extensively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticized and repudiated the "self" and established the "public," overthrown bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit. This has effectively promoted the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the province.

Many participants in the study classes originally had a vague understanding of the harm caused by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. To address this situation, many local study classes organized participants to study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word. They guided them to take "criticize self and repudiate revisionism" as the key, to thoroughly expose the harm of factionalism, and to turn the study classes into battlefields for overthrowing factionalism. They also used the classes to influence the outside, mobilizing the broad revolutionary masses to consciously resist, eradicate, and make factionalism stink and lose its market. After many workers from the Guangzhou Lighter Factory participated in the study classes, their consciousness was greatly raised. They resolutely overthrew factionalism and strictly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. The heads of the two factions at Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education participated in the study class organized by the provincial revolutionary preparatory group. They seriously studied Mao Zedong Thought and, at the meeting, thoroughly criticized the "self" and exposed the evil consequences of factionalism, immediately eliminating the antagonistic sentiments. These two comrades then returned to the institute together and convened a joint meeting of all teachers and students, achieving revolutionary great unity.

"The self" is the root of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. If the "self" is not eliminated, factionalism will not die; if the "self" is not eliminated, the "public" will not be established. Participants in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various parts of Guangdong have summarized eight major harms of the "self" for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat: with the "self," one will lose the direction of progress in politics; in the mind, there will be thoughts of seeking fame and profit, harming others for personal gain; in study, there will be no progress, no learning, and no application; in work, there will be sloppiness and irresponsibility; in life, there will be a pursuit of enjoyment and peaceful evolution; in labor, there will be a tendency to pick the light work and avoid the heavy; in production, there will be disregard for quality; in revolutionary struggle, there will be wavering and inability to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses inside and outside the study classes have bravely exposed their "self" without fear of embarrassment, fought against their "self" without fear of pain, and everyone has striven to be a vanguard in the fight against the "self," ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented.

Promoting the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao personally is a prominent feature of the various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various parts of Guangdong. They study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, applying one after learning one, combining learning with application, and seeing immediate results. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." As soon as this latest instruction from Chairman Mao was issued, the working class in the Guangzhou area responded swiftly and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Various fronts and universities also quickly achieved revolutionary great unity by industry, system, and class. Now, 80 counties and cities in Guangdong Province (accounting for 75% of the total number of counties and cities in the province) have achieved revolutionary great unity or reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great unity. Some prefectures and counties have also established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups.

    广东省大办各种类型毛泽东思想学习班
    有力推动全面落实毛主席最新指示
    据新华社广州二十九日电　广东省革命委员会筹备小组自成立以来，一直把宣传、学习、贯彻和落实毛主席最新指示摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，作为活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席最新指示的极其重要的措施。从去年十月中旬到目前，全省各地、各单位举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的革命工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和干部达三百三十多万人。他们大学大用毛泽东思想，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，有力地推动了全省群众全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
    参加学习班的许多学员，原来对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害认识不清。针对这种情况，许多地方的学习班组织学员逐字逐句地认真学习和深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，引导他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，大揭派性的危害，使学习班成为打倒派性的战场，并且以班内促班外，带动广大革命群众纷纷起来自觉地抵制派性，铲除派性，使派性在群众中越来越臭，越来越没有市场。广州打火机厂许多职工参加学习班学习后，觉悟大大提高，坚决打倒派性，不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示，全厂很快实现了革命大联合。广州体育学院两派组织的头头参加了省革筹小组举办的学习班，认真地学习毛泽东思想，他们在讲用会上狠斗“私”字，大揭派性的恶果，当场消除了对立情绪。这两位同志又一起回到本院召开全院师生联合大会，实现了革命大联合。
    “私”字是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的总根子。
  “私”字不灭，派性不死；“私”字不灭，“公”字难立。参加广东各地毛泽东思想学习班学习的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众给“私”字总结出八大危害：有了
  “私”字，在政治上就会迷失前进的方向；在头脑里就会产生争名夺利、损人利己的想法；在学习上就会不求上进，学不进，用不上；在工作上就会马虎了事，不负责任；在生活上就会贪图享受，和平演变；在劳动上就会拈轻怕重，挑肥拣瘦；在生产上就会不顾质量；在革命斗争中就会左右摇摆，不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。广大学员和学习班外的广大革命群众，亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，人人争做斗私的尖兵，保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。
    大兴毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，是广东各地举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班的一个显著特点。他们学习毛主席最新指示，学一条，用一条，学用结合，立竿见影。毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席这一最新指示刚下达，广州地区工人阶级闻风而动，迅速实现了革命大联合。各条战线和大专院校，也迅速按行业、按系统、按班级实现了革命大联合。现在，广东全省已有八十个县、市（占全省的县、市总数的百分之七十五）的两派群众组织，实现了革命大联合或达成了实现革命大联合的协议，一些专区、县还建立了革命委员会或革筹小组。
