We must enthusiastically respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to "raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We must further strengthen the "three supports and two militaries" work and further improve the work of loving the people. We must firmly stand on the side of the proletariat, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, learn from the masses, and conscientiously implement the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions." We must carry out in-depth, detailed, and patient ideological and political work.

    要热烈响应林彪副主席发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，进一步做好爱民工作。要坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，相信和依靠广大革命群众，向群众学习，认真执行“支左不支派”的原则，进行深入、细致、耐心的思想政治工作。
