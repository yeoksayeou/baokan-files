Some say: A housewife is for the family. No! Women in the era of Chairman Mao are completely and thoroughly for the people.

The head of the Longtan Residents' Committee, Zhu Ruoying, has been diligently studying Chairman Mao's works for many years. Recently, she not only studies Chairman Mao's works more diligently herself but also actively organizes Mao Zedong Thought study classes for neighborhood residents. Every day, she studies with her neighbors, fights against selfishness and criticizes revisionism, and criticizes the Chinese Khrushchev together. Under the nurturing of the brilliant thoughts of the "Three Articles," Zhu Ruoying has done many good deeds for the people.

Two years ago, Zhu Ruoying moved to Longtan Street. At that time, she saw that many residents had difficulty making clothes, especially families with many children. She used the money she saved by eating and living frugally to buy a sewing machine, specifically to serve the neighborhood residents. She voluntarily mended over a hundred pieces of clothing and knitted more than ten sweaters for the residents.

Last winter, many Red Guards came from out of town. Zhu Ruoying heard that they were "guests" invited by Chairman Mao, so she day and night arranged their food and accommodation. She took out her own quilts to let the Red Guards use, while she only used a cotton-padded jacket. To let the Red Guards see the glorious image of our great leader Mao Zedong as soon as they arrived in the capital, she used her own money to buy many portraits of Mao Zedong and quotations from Chairman Mao, and respectfully hung them in the places where the Red Guards stayed. Later, when the Red Guards left, they often sent letters full of revolutionary enthusiasm from far away.

A widow in her sixties, whose son was a martyr, suffered from paralysis and needed someone to take care of her. Zhu Ruoying thought: The son of this old lady gave his precious life for the happiness of the oppressed people. Without the heroic struggle of the martyrs, there would be no socialist motherland today. Taking care of the relatives of the martyrs is our duty and everyone's responsibility. Therefore, Zhu Ruoying took the initiative to take care of this old martyr's relative, feeding her and dressing her as if she were her own family. The old lady was extremely grateful and said, "Only those taught by Chairman Mao can do this, only in the new society can there be such things!" Zhu Ruoying said, "This is what I should do. If there is anything not up to standard, you can say it."

Some time ago, a neighbor's child accidentally fell into the Longtan Lake, and the children who were playing with him were very scared and ran to find Zhu Ruoying. She heard this and felt as if her heart was on fire, immediately running towards the Longtan Lake. While running, she thought: This child's father works in the same department as my husband, and they are from opposing factions. If the child is saved, of course, there is no problem; but if the child is not saved, if the child's parents have a misunderstanding, what should I do? At this moment, she heard Chairman Mao's earnest teachings in her ears: "An foreigner, without any selfish motives, regards the liberation cause of the Chinese people as his own cause. What spirit is this?..." An foreigner can give his precious life for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, how can I not save a life in danger?

Zhu Ruoying also thought of her own bitter history. Whenever she encountered problems she couldn't understand, she would think of her life in the old society. Although she had only lived a few years in the old society, she had experienced all the bitterness and sweetness of human life. Born ten months old, her parents died, and she was taken in as a foster daughter. Later, she was repeatedly taken away by evil landlords to be a maid, a cow, and a horse, struggling under the whip. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that saved her from the hell on earth and let her live a happy life. Zhu Ruoying thought of this and felt ashamed of her momentary selfish thoughts. She felt that even if there was a tiny bit of selfishness in her mind, she would be unworthy of Chairman Mao. She quickened her pace and resolutely ran towards the Longtan Lake.

Zhu Ruoying overcame all difficulties and finally saved the child from the Longtan Lake and sent him to the hospital.

The child's father, upon hearing this, was very moved and ran to Zhu Ruoying's house to thank her. Zhu Ruoying's response was simple: "We are class brothers and sisters. Your child and my child are the same. What is there to thank for?"

This is a "housewife" in New China who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

### 有人说：家庭妇女，就是为家庭。不对！毛泽东时代的妇女是完全彻底为人民

    有人说：家庭妇女，就是为家庭。不对！毛泽东时代的妇女是
    完全彻底为人民
    龙潭居委会主任祝如英，几年来一直坚持活学活用毛主席著作，最近，她不但自己更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，还积极举办街道居民毛泽东思想学习班。每天和街坊邻居一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。在
  “老三篇”的光辉思想哺育下，祝如英为人民做了大量的好事。
    两年前，祝如英迁来龙潭街，当时，她看到不少居民做衣服比较困难，尤其是孩子多的人家，困难更大。她把省吃俭用节约下来的钱，买了一架缝纫机，专为街道居民服务，义务为居民补做了一百多件衣服，打了十几件毛衣。
    前年冬天，外地来了许多红小兵，祝如英听说是毛主席请来的“客人”，便日夜为他们安排食宿。她把自己家的被子拿出来给红小兵盖，自己只盖一件棉衣。为了让红小兵一来到首都，就能看到我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象，她用自己的钱买了很多毛主席像和毛主席语录，恭恭敬敬地贴在红小兵们住的地方。后来，红小兵们走了，还常常从遥远遥远的地方寄来充满革命激情的书信。
    一位六十多岁的烈属老大娘，得了瘫痪症，需要人照顾。祝如英想：老大娘的儿子，为受压迫人民的幸福，献出了宝贵的生命。没有先烈们的英勇奋斗，就不会有今天的社会主义祖国。照顾烈士的亲属，是我们应尽的义务，人人有责。于是，祝如英主动去照顾这位烈属老大娘，吃饭穿衣，象对待自己的亲人一样。老大娘万分感激地说：“只有毛主席教导的人才会这样，只有新社会才有这样的事哟！”祝如英说：“这是我应该做的，有什么不到的地方，你尽管说。”
    前些时候，一个街坊的孩子不小心掉到龙潭湖里，和他一起玩的孩子们可吓坏了，跑来找祝如英。她一听，象火烧心头，拔腿就向龙潭湖跑去。一边跑，一边想：这个孩子的爸爸，和自己的爱人在一个机关工作，是对立的两派。如果孩子救活了，当然没事；万一孩子救不活，如果孩子的父母发生误会，怎么办呢？这时候，她耳边响起毛主席谆谆教导的声音：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？……”一个外国人，能为中国人民的革命事业献出宝贵的生命，我怎能见死不救呢？
    祝如英又想到自己苦难的历史。每当她遇到想不通问题的时候，她就想想自己解放前的生活。她虽然在旧社会只度过了十几年，但却尝尽了旧社会人间的酸甜苦辣。出生十个月，死去了父母，被人收去作养女。后来，几次被黑心的地主老财抢去，做丫头，当牛马，在皮鞭下挣扎。是毛主席、共产党，把她从人间地狱里救了出来，过上了幸福生活。祝如英想到这里，为自己一闪念的私心杂念感到羞愧。她觉得，自己头脑中即使有半星点私心，也对不起毛主席。她加快了步伐，坚定地向龙潭湖跑去。
    祝如英排除了一切困难，终于从龙潭湖里救出了孩子，送到了医院。
    那孩子的父亲知道后，很感动，跑到祝如英家里来道谢。祝如英回答得很简单：“我们是阶级兄妹，你的孩子和我的孩子一样，有什么好道谢的呢？”
    这就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国的一个“家庭妇女”！
