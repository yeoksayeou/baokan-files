Our support-left group was deployed to Zhangjiakou Brick and Tile Factory to carry out support-left tasks in July last year. Through half a year of practice, we deeply feel that only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, and fully mobilizing the masses to expose and overthrow factionalism, can we implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieve, consolidate, and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of revolution. Only by fighting against selfishness can we implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions.

When our support-left group entered the Brick and Tile Factory, the two revolutionary mass organizations were in a state of severe factionalism, and the "internal war" was intense. Upon arrival, the two factions had different attitudes towards us. The "United Front" faction sent a special car to welcome us, organized a welcoming ceremony, and arranged our accommodation and meals warmly. They also actively introduced the situation to us. The "Red Alliance" faction, seeing that we arrived in the "United Front" car, had a different opinion of us, saying that we were invited by the "United Front." They ignored us when we met, ridiculed and mocked us when we spoke, and evaded our questions. Comparing the two factions, we felt that the "United Front" was better. Although we did not publicly support the "United Front," we had a bias in our minds. We saw more advantages in the "United Front" and more disadvantages in the "Red Alliance." We did not praise what should be praised in the "Red Alliance" and did not criticize what should be criticized in the "United Front." When the "Red Alliance" pointed out the shortcomings of the "United Front," we explained, "Such a large mass organization is bound to have some shortcomings." As a result, not only did we not promote the great alliance of revolution, but we also intensified the antagonism between the two factions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thinking in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." How to guide petty-bourgeois thinking onto the track of proletarian revolution? We took "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, actively studied and applied the "Three Articles," and summarized and reviewed our previous work. Some said: "Using emotions to replace policies, using the masses' attitude towards us to influence our attitude towards the masses; being warm towards one faction and cold towards the other, this is the 'selfishness' at work." Others said: "Supporting the left with selfishness will inevitably lead to supporting one faction and suppressing the other, supporting factions instead of the left." Still, others said: "Supporting the left with selfishness will lead to confusion between right and wrong, unclear banners, and the more you support, the more confused you become." We also summarized the harm of supporting the left with selfishness: it is not conducive to following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; it is not conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; it is not conducive to the great alliance of revolution; it is not conducive to military-civilian unity; it is not conducive to the great criticism of revolution; it increases the antagonism between the two revolutionary mass organizations. From this, we deeply realized that only by fighting against the "selfishness" in our minds can we firmly implement the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions."

Help the leaders fight selfishness and take the lead in the great alliance

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." To help the two revolutionary mass organizations overcome factionalism, we went deep into the workshops and teams to grasp the living thoughts, vigorously publicize Mao Zedong Thought, and do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. First, we focused on the living thoughts of the leaders, inspiring them to take the lead in dismantling the mountain strongholds. We investigated the living thoughts of the leaders of the two factions one by one and had targeted talks with them repeatedly. At first, we went to find the leader of the "Red Alliance," Wang Jincai. The "Red Alliance" members wanted to avoid us, saying, "We have no leaders, everyone is a service person." Later, we asked for names one by one and finally found Wang Jincai. He said angrily, "Why find me? We can't talk." Although we encountered resistance, we received education. The "Red Alliance" leaders did not want to approach us, which showed that we lacked deep class feelings with the masses. So, we studied Chairman Mao's works with them, participated in production labor with them, and reminisced about hardships together. They worked the day shift, and we followed the day shift. They worked the night shift, and we followed the night shift. When they finished work, we went to their homes to talk. At the same time, we publicized the advantages of the "Red Alliance" when we found them and praised them when they corrected their shortcomings. We supported their actions and words that conformed to Mao Zedong Thought. Our approach gradually deepened the class feelings between the "Red Alliance" leaders and us.

In the high tide of revolutionary great alliance, the "Red Alliance" leaders actively proposed to the "United Front" to achieve the revolutionary great alliance. We thought the "Red Alliance" proposal was in line with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, so we organized the leaders of the two factions to negotiate. The "United Front" leaders proposed: to achieve the great alliance, they must admit that our direction of struggle is correct, and first write a "confession" to us. Otherwise, they would withdraw from the "Red Alliance" and apply to join our "United Front." As a result, the negotiation broke down quickly. We analyzed it and found that it was the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism of the "United Front" leaders that caused them to want to "devour" the other side. We then publicized the benefits of achieving the revolutionary great alliance to the "United Front" leaders and pointed out that their desire to "devour" the other side was wrong. After consultation, we organized the second round of negotiations. This time, we first organized the leaders of the two factions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." According to Chairman Mao's teaching of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," we resolved the differences between the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations, raised their awareness, and overthrew factionalism. In this negotiation, the leaders of the two factions both proposed: to unite is fine, but the power must be in the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. At first glance, it seemed reasonable. But upon reflection, it was still the "selfishness" at work, both sides wanting to hold the power in "my" hands, wanting to compete for "seats."

To raise the leaders' ideological awareness and make them pioneers of the revolutionary great alliance, we started from class education and organized the leaders of the two factions to reminisce about hardships. Through investigation, we found that the "Red Alliance" leader Wang Jincai and the "United Front" leader Li Yushan were both from poor peasant families and had both suffered exploitation and oppression from the landlord class in the old society, living a life worse than cattle. In their teens, they picked coal together, wearing patched clothes all year round. In winter, to keep warm, they huddled together back to back. After liberation, they both worked in the same factory and shared a deep love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They both hated the evil old society and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, with no fundamental conflict of interests. Through reminiscing about hardships, they raised their class consciousness, and the two of them cried, saying: "We are bitter gourds on the same vine, with no fundamental conflict of interests. Due to the poisoning of the capitalist reactionary line and the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, we split into two irreconcilable factions, each wanting to 'devour' the other, each protecting their own strongholds, waging 'internal war' without rest, completely deviating from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment." Both sides voluntarily made self-criticisms, actively checked their own shortcomings and mistakes, and had the desire to achieve the revolutionary great alliance.

Use the Mao Zedong Thought study class as the battlefield to overthrow factionalism

With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fully mobilizing the masses to expose and overthrow factionalism is another important link to achieve a good revolutionary great alliance in ideology. The leaders' thoughts were clarified, but some masses still had different opinions. One faction's members thought their leader had "gone revisionist" and "surrendered" to the other side; the other faction's members said their leader was "compromising" and "muddling through." To solve these ideological problems, we took "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "to mobilize the masses, let the masses themselves rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves," we organized large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and organized the broad revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, talk about Mao Zedong Thought's proletarian revolutionary line, and discuss the benefits of the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination. We launched a total attack and encirclement battle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, making the Mao Zedong Thought study class an important battlefield for exposing and overthrowing factionalism. We thoroughly exposed the manifestations of factionalism, discussed its dangers, revealed its evil consequences, peeled off its disguise, listed its crimes, sued its evil deeds, found its essence, and dug out its roots. All the revolutionary workers and family members in the factory hated and resisted factionalism, making factionalism have no place to stay and no place to land.

In the struggle against factionalism, the broad revolutionary masses used living facts to illustrate the reactionary nature of factionalism and the harm it brought to the Cultural Revolution. Some said, before we split, we always directed our arrows at the capitalist roaders. Once we split, factionalism erupted, disregarding the party's interests, only caring about the interests of small groups, not distinguishing right from wrong, not drawing clear enemy lines, fighting over personal grievances, replacing policies with emotions, not fighting against the capitalist roaders, but directing our arrows at our own class brothers, indulging in "internal war," hurting our own comrades, and giving the enemy an opportunity. The capitalist roaders and bad elements fanned the flames on both sides, sabotaging the great alliance, saying to one faction that the other faction is a "royalist faction," and to the other faction that this faction is a "monster." Due to factionalism, bad elements were treated as friends, while our own class brothers were treated as enemies. Working on the same machine, they did not cooperate with each other, causing serious damage to production. Through exposing crimes, discussing dangers, and digging out roots, everyone realized: factionalism is a big poisonous snake, a manifestation of "selfishness," a great enemy of the revolution. If factionalism is not overthrown, party spirit cannot be strengthened. Therefore, everyone voluntarily compared themselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fought against "selfishness," fought against factionalism, seriously carried out self-criticism, exposed and resisted factionalism.

Through a series of work, the two revolutionary mass organizations truly achieved the revolutionary great alliance in ideology and successfully established the revolutionary committee.

    发动群众　依靠群众　打倒派性
    解放军四六一八部队驻张家口市砖瓦社支左小组
    我们支左小组，是去年七月间进驻张家口砖瓦社担任支左任务的。经过半年来的实践，我们深深体会到：只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，同时要充分发动群众搞臭派性，打倒派性，才能落实毛主席的最新指示，实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。狠斗“私”字，才能执行支左不支派的原则
    我们支左小组进驻砖瓦社的时候，正是两派革命群众组织派性严重发作，“内战”打得火热的时候。一进社，两派革命群众组织对我们就是两种看法：“联总”派专车接我们，还组织了夹道欢迎，热情安排住食，登门问寒问暖，主动介绍情况。“红联会”一看我们是坐“联总”的车来的，就对我们有了看法，说我们是“联总”请来的。他们对我们的态度是一见面扭头不理，一说话讽刺挖苦，问情况推三阻四。我们把两派一比较，总觉得“联总”好。当时尽管没有公开表态支持“联总”，但从思想上已经有倾向性了。对“联总”看优点多，对“红联会”看缺点多；对“红联会”该表扬的不表扬，对“联总”该批评的也不批评。“红联会”指出“联总”的缺点，我们还解释说：“这么大个群众组织，有缺点也是难免的。”这样做的结果，不仅没有促进革命大联合，而且使两派革命群众的对立情绪越来越严重了。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”如何把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道？我们以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用“老三篇”，总结检查了前一阶段的工作。有的说：“以感情代替政策，以群众对待自己的态度影响自己对待群众的态度；对一派热，对另一派凉，这就是‘私’字作怪。”有的说：“带着
  ‘私’字支左，就必然会支一派、压一派，支派不支左。”还有的说：“带着‘私’字支左，就会是非不清，旗帜不明，越支越糊涂。”我们还总结了带着“私”字支左的害处：不利于紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；不利于落实毛主席的最新指示；不利于革命的大联合；不利于军民团结；不利于革命大批判；增加了两派革命群众组织的对立情绪。我们从而深刻地认识到：只有狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，才能坚决执行“支左不支派”的原则。
      帮助头头斗掉私心带头大联合
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”为了帮助两派革命群众打倒派性，我们深入到车间、班组狠抓活思想，大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入细致的思想政治工作。首先是狠抓头头的活思想，启发头头带头搬山头。我们对两派头头的活思想逐个进行了调查，有针对性地反复谈心。开始，我们去找“红联会”的头头王进才，
  “红联会”的群众想回避我们，他们说：“我们没有头头，人人都是服务员。”后来，我们就逐个地问名字，才找到了王进才。他气呼呼地说：“找我干什么？咱们说不来。”虽然碰了钉子，我们却受到了教育。“红联会”的头头不愿意接近我们，这说明我们和群众还缺乏深厚的阶级感情。于是，我们就和他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起参加生产劳动，一起忆苦思甜。他们上白班，我们跟白班，他们上夜班，我们跟夜班，他们下班，我们就到他们家里去谈心。同时，我们发现“红联会”的优点就宣扬，他们改正了缺点就表扬，符合毛泽东思想的言行就支持。我们这种做法，使“红联会”的头头和我们之间逐步加深了阶级感情。
    在革命大联合的高潮中，“红联会”的头头主动向“联总”提出了实现革命大联合的倡议。我们认为“红联会”的倡议是符合毛主席最新指示的，就组织两派的头头谈判。“联总”的头头提出：搞大联合，他们就得承认我们的斗争大方向是正确的，先向我们写“认罪书”。要不就退出“红联会”，申请参加我们“联总”。结果没谈多久就崩了。我们一分析，这是“联总”头头的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，想把对方“吃”掉。我们就向“联总”的头头宣传实现革命大联合的好处，指出他们想把对方“吃”掉是错误的。经过协商，又组织第二次谈判。这次，我们首先组织两派头头学习了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”按照毛主席“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的教导，解决两派革命群众组织头头之间的分歧，提高认识，打倒派性。在这次谈判中，两派头头都提出：要联合可以，但权一定要掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。猛一听，很有道理。但细想想，还是“私”字在作怪，双方都想把权掌在“我”的手里，想争“席位”。
    为了提高头头的思想觉悟，做革命大联合的带头人，我们就从阶级教育入手，组织两派的头头忆苦思甜。经过调查，“红联会”的头头王进才和“联总”的头头李玉山，都是贫农出身，在旧社会都受过地主阶级的剥削和压迫，过着牛马不如的生活；两个人十几岁就一块拣煤核，一年四季都穿着补了又补的破单衣，冬天为了防寒，两个人背靠背地挤在一起取暖。解放后，两个人又都在一个厂里当工人，他们都共同热爱伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，共同仇恨万恶的旧社会和党内一小撮走资派，根本没什么利害冲突。经过忆苦思甜，他们提高了阶级觉悟，两个人痛哭流涕地说：“我们是一根藤上的苦瓜，没有根本的利害冲突，由于受资产阶级反动路线的毒害和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，使我们分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织，你想‘吃’掉我，我想整垮你，各保山头，‘内战’不休，完全违背了毛主席的伟大战略部署。”双方都自觉地做了自我批评，主动检查自己的缺点、错误，有了实现革命大联合的愿望。
  把毛泽东思想学习班当作打倒派性的战场
    以毛主席最新指示为纲，充分发动群众搞臭派性，是从思想上搞好革命大联合的又一重要环节。头头的思想通了，但有的群众还议论纷纷。一派的群众认为自己的头头变“修”了，向人家“投降”；另一派的群众说自己的头头是“搞折衷”、“和稀泥”。为了切实解决这些思想问题，我们以“斗私，批修”为纲，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己”的教导，大办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命群众大学毛主席的最新指示，大讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大谈革命大联合和革命三结合的好处。对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性发动了总攻击，展开了围歼战，把毛泽东思想学习班，当成为搞臭派性、打倒派性的重要战场。大摆派性的表现，大论派性的危害，大揭派性的恶果，大剥派性的画皮，大列派性的罪状，大诉派性的罪恶，大找派性的实质，大挖派性的根子。全社广大革命工人和家属，人人仇视派性，个个抵制派性，使派性没有安身之处，没有落脚之地。
    在同派性作斗争中，广大革命群众，用活的事实说明派性的反动性和给文化大革命带来的危害。有的说，我们没有分裂以前，把矛头一直对准走资派。一分裂，派性发作，不顾党的利益，只顾小团体利益，分不清是非，划不清敌我界限，闹意气，泄私愤，以感情代替政策，不去斗争走资派，却把矛头对准自己的阶级兄弟，热衷于打“内战”，伤害了自己的同志，使敌人有机可乘。走资派和坏人两头煽风点火，破坏大联合，对这一派说那一派是“保皇派”，对那一派又说这一派是“牛鬼蛇神”。由于派性作怪，把坏人也当成朋友，而把自己的阶级兄弟却当成了仇人，同一台机器干活，互相不配合，使生产受到严重损失。通过摆罪状，论危害，挖根子，大家认识到：派性是一条大毒蛇，是“私”字的表现，是革命的大敌，派性不打倒，党性就增强不了。因此，大家自觉地对照毛主席的最新指示，狠斗“私”字，狠斗派性，认真开展自我批评，搞臭派性，抵制派性。
    经过一系列的工作，两派革命群众组织真正从思想上实现了革命大联合，并且顺利地建立了革命委员会。
