The masses and the army are the foundation of victory.

Relying on the broad masses of the people, relying on a people's army, and relying on the ironclad unity between the military and the civilian population to accomplish the tasks of the revolutionary struggle is a great strategic thought consistently advocated by Chairman Mao.

In the new year, our army is shouldering even more important tasks. We must place even greater trust in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and model ourselves after Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." We must further do a good job in loving the people and strengthen military-civilian unity. This is an important guarantee for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and seizing comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

The ideological foundation for strengthening military-civilian unity is the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Only on this basis can our army unite closely with the broadest revolutionary masses and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops smoothly in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao.

The broad ranks of cadres and fighters in our army must earnestly study, faithfully carry out, enthusiastically propagate, and courageously defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad leftist masses, and regard helping the broad revolutionary masses implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the top priority in the "three supports" and "two militaries" and in loving the people. This is the fundamental way to strengthen military-civilian unity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make our whole Party march in step and struggle for a common goal, we must oppose individualism and sectarianism." The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a great obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and to strengthening military-civilian unity, and must be resolutely overcome and smashed.

We must stand firmly on the class stand of the proletarian party nature, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding of supporting the left and loving the people, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the highest standard for distinguishing right from wrong and handling problems. We must resolutely carry out the principle of "supporting the left, not the faction." For revolutionary mass organizations, we must support and encourage actions and statements that conform to Mao Zedong Thought; for actions and statements that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we must criticize and help, and carry out thorough, detailed, and painstaking ideological and political work to guide them onto the track of the proletarian revolution. We must not depart from the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and substitute policy with personal feelings.

We must widely organize propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought to propagate Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses. We must vigorously run classes for studying Mao Zedong Thought to help revolutionary mass organizations study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. We must actively guide revolutionary mass organizations to proceed from the overall interests of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rather than from the interests of small groups, in dealing with the army's "three supports" and "two militaries."

All criticisms from the masses, we should welcome with enthusiasm. For criticisms and opinions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we should humbly accept them and "admit our mistakes to the masses frankly and correct them immediately." For incorrect opinions, we should use Mao Zedong Thought to patiently persuade and educate. We must be modest and prudent, and forever be the students of the masses.

The more the class enemy is nearing its death, the more desperately it will struggle. They spread rumors and slander, stir up trouble, and resort to all kinds of tricks to try to sabotage the close unity between the People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must keep our eyes open and be vigilant, and never let their plots succeed!

In the new year, the broad ranks of cadres and fighters in our army must deeply study the lofty qualities and advanced experience of the heroes of the Fourth Platoon, Comrade Li Wenzhong, and the support-left personnel of the 834th Unit stationed in Beijing Knitting Factory. We must take them as shining examples, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in supporting the left and loving the people, do more good deeds for the people, and create new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great people, the great army, and the great Mao Zedong Thought will further unite and achieve the great strategic goal of seizing comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在毛泽东思想基础上加强军民团结
    “兵民是胜利之本”。
    依靠广大人民群众，依靠一支人民的军队，依靠军民之间钢铁般的团结，去完成革命斗争的任务，是毛主席一贯的伟大战略思想。
    在新的一年里，我军担负着更多更重要的任务。我们一定要更加相信和依靠广大革命群众，模范地贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，进一步做好爱民工作，大力加强军民团结。这是全面落实毛主席的最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。
    加强军民团结的思想基础，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，是毛主席的一系列最新指示。只有在这个基础上，我军才能同最广大的革命群众紧紧团结在一起，使无产阶级文化大革命按照毛主席指出的方向不断顺利发展。
    我军广大指战员必须认真学习毛主席的最新指示，忠实执行毛主席的最新指示，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示，勇敢捍卫毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众，把帮助广大革命群众落实毛主席的最新指示，作为“三支”“两军”和爱民工作的头等大事。这是加强军民团结的根本。
    毛主席教导我们：“要使我们全党的步调整齐一致，为一个共同目标而奋斗，我们一定要反对个人主义和宗派主义。”资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的极大障碍，也是加强军民团结的极大障碍，必须坚决克服，坚决打倒。
    我们要坚定地站在无产阶级党性的立场上，用毛泽东思想统一对支左爱民的认识，用毛泽东思想作为辨别是非、处理问题的最高标准，坚决执行“支左不支派”的原则。对革命的群众组织，凡是符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，就支持，就鼓励；不符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，就批评，就帮助，就要进行深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，把它引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。绝不能离开毛泽东思想的原则，以感情代替政策。
    我们要广泛组织毛泽东思想宣传队，向广大革命群众宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示。要大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命群众组织活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修。要积极引导革命群众组织从无产阶级文化大革命的整体利益出发，而不是从小团体的利益出发，来对待军队的“三支”“两军”工作。
    一切来自人民群众的批评，我们都应该热情欢迎。凡是符合毛泽东思想的批评和意见，都要虚心接受，“实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正”。对于不正确的意见，则要用毛泽东思想进行耐心的说服教育。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，永远当群众的小学生。
    阶级敌人越临近死亡，越要进行绝望的挣扎。他们造谣诬蔑，挑拨离间，千方百计地妄图破坏人民解放军同广大革命群众的亲密团结，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们一定要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，决不让他们的阴谋得逞！
    在新的一年里，我军广大指战员一定要深入学习英雄四排、李文忠同志和八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员的崇高品质和先进经验，以他们为光辉榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做好支左爱民工作，多为群众做好事，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民建立新的功勋。
    伟大的人民，伟大的军队，在伟大的毛泽东思想基础上进一步团结起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的伟大战略目标，就一定能够实现！
                          （一月十二日）
