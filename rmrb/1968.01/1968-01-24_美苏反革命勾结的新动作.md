The so-called "comprehensive draft" of the "non-proliferation treaty" jointly concocted by U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists was released on January 18 at the 17-nation "disarmament" conference in Geneva. This is a sign of the intensified counter-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists in the face of an increasingly unfavorable world situation.

This so-called "comprehensive draft" supplements the "international supervision" clauses that were lacking in the draft treaty proposed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in August of last year, and makes textual revisions to some other clauses. However, the fundamental purpose of this treaty remains unchanged: to deprive the "non-nuclear" countries, which are threatened by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, of their right to develop nuclear weapons, to place some countries under their so-called "nuclear protection," and to maintain the status of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists as "nuclear overlords." Therefore, the release of the so-called "comprehensive draft" is noteworthy not so much for its content as for the counter-revolutionary political trends it reveals on the part of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Everyone knows that the U.S. and the Soviet Union initially collaborated on the so-called "non-proliferation treaty" mainly to try to restrain China's hands and prevent China from mastering nuclear weapons. The great victory of China's successful nuclear test shattered this plot of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. However, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism still attempt to use this treaty as a tool to incite anti-China sentiment. In the beginning of the new year, they eagerly pushed out this so-called "comprehensive draft" of the treaty, driven by their common need to intensify anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities.

In his recently delivered "State of the Union" address, Johnson openly regarded the Soviet revisionist clique, which betrays the revolutionary people of the world, as his main friend, and regarded China, which firmly supports the revolutionary people of the world, as his main enemy. He demanded that the Soviet revisionist clique collaborate more closely with U.S. imperialism to jointly oppose China, to help U.S. imperialism get out of its internal and external difficulties, and to regard reaching an agreement on the "non-proliferation treaty" as the first "important step" to strengthen this "international cooperation." The Soviet revisionist clique immediately responded to Johnson's demand and reached an agreement with U.S. imperialism. Indeed, their "cooperation" is very close. This once again nakedly exposes the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique actively serving U.S. imperialism. People can clearly see that Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are the number one accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

It can be fully anticipated that, with the so-called "comprehensive draft" of the "non-proliferation treaty" as the starting point, in the new year, as the world revolutionary storm becomes more and more fierce, the counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists will intensify step by step. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." However, this struggle precisely reflects that the revolutionary people are approaching victory. All the counter-revolutionary schemes of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are nothing but nooses around their own necks.

### 美苏反革命勾结的新动作

    美苏反革命勾结的新动作
    美帝国主义和苏修集团合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约的全面草案，一月十八日在日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议上出笼了。这是美帝苏修两家在对它们越来越不利的世界形势下加紧反革命全球勾结的一个标志。
    这个所谓“全面草案”，补足了去年八月美苏合伙提出的条约草案中所短缺的“国际监督”的条款，并且对其他一些条款作了文字上的修改。但是，万变不离其宗，这个条约的目的仍然无非是要剥夺遭受美苏核威胁的“无核国家”发展核武器的权利，把一些国家置于它们的所谓“核保护”之下，以维持美帝苏修两家的“核霸王”地位。因此，所谓“全面草案”的出笼，引人注目的与其说是草案的内容，不如说是这一行动所显示的美帝、苏修的反革命政治动向。
    谁都知道，美苏当初合伙要搞所谓“防止核扩散”条约，主要是为了想要束缚中国的手脚，阻止中国掌握核武器。中国核试验成功的伟大胜利，粉碎了美苏的这个阴谋。但是，美帝苏修仍然企图把这个条约作为煽动反华的工具。它们在新年伊始，迫不及待地推出这个条约的所谓“全面草案”，就是出于它们加紧反华、反共、反人民、反革命的共同需要。
    约翰逊在他刚刚发表的“国情咨文”里，公开把叛卖世界革命人民的苏修集团当作主要朋友，把坚决支持世界革命人民的中国当作主要敌人。他要求苏修集团同美帝国主义加紧勾结，共同反华，来帮助美帝国主义摆脱内外交困的窘境，并且把达成“防止核扩散”条约的协议作为加强这种“国际合作”的第一个“重要的步骤”。苏修集团就立即响应约翰逊的要求，同美帝国主义达成了协议。真是可谓“合作”紧密。这就再一次赤裸裸地暴露了苏修集团积极为美帝国主义效劳的叛徒面目。人们可以看得很清楚，勃列日?夫、柯西金之流是不折不扣的美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    完全可以预料得到，以所谓“防止核扩散”条约全面草案作为开端，在新的一年里，随着世界革命风暴的日益迅猛，美帝苏修的反革命勾结，必将步步加紧。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。但是，这种挣扎恰恰反映了革命人民日益接近了胜利。美帝苏修合伙搞的一切反革命勾当，都不过是套在它们自己脖子上的绞索而已。
