8341 Unit stationed at Beijing Knitting Factory's leftist support team helps revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts.

Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, they mobilize the masses to suppress factionalism. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in this factory has become a "rat crossing the street," and as soon as it shows its head, everyone shouts to beat it. Revolutionary workers are closely united, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Editor's Note: "Engaging in factionalism is the same as engaging in individualism." "The root of factionalism is the bourgeois 'self,' and engaging in factionalism is a malignant outbreak of bourgeois individualism."

The comrades from Beijing Knitting Factory have spoken so profoundly! They have exposed the ugly soul of factionalism without reservation.

To defeat factionalism, one must fight against selfishness and thoroughly expose bourgeois individualism.

To defeat factionalism, one must fully mobilize the masses, list the crimes of factionalism, expose the harm of factionalism, and have everyone criticize and resist it, making it like a "rat crossing the street" with nowhere to hide.

Every proletarian revolutionary must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, consciously break with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, firmly stand on the standpoint of proletarian party spirit, and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a key issue in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and ensuring a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: The joint reporting team of the capital's news units at Beijing Knitting Factory reports: The leftist support team of the 8341 Unit of the People's Liberation Army, stationed at Beijing Knitting Factory, helps the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to severely strike down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Now, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in this factory has become a "rat crossing the street," and as soon as it shows its head, everyone shouts to beat it. The broad revolutionary workers have shaken off the influence of factionalism and consciously handle issues according to proletarian party spirit. This has played a significant role in implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions.

(1) Guide revolutionary masses to distinguish between two types of contradictions, master the correct methods of handling internal contradictions among the people, draw a clear line between intense ideological struggles and factional struggles, and peel off the mask of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

The original "Red Rebels" and "East Is Red" two revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing Knitting Factory had some differing views on the movement in the factory, and some of these were normal differences in opinion. However, during the arguments, some people arbitrarily labeled others, exaggerated minor issues, confused the two types of contradictions, and used all means to attack the other side, trying to bring down the other side. This led them into the quagmire of factional struggles. At that time, some people even said this was "upholding principles" and "revolutionary action," leading to an increasingly fierce "internal war," which deviated from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for a period.

"One must be able to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." After the 8341 Unit's leftist support team entered the factory in June last year, they used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and actively guided the two revolutionary mass organizations to break away from factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The leftist support team organized both sides to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," guiding them to analyze the contradictions in the factory, identify which are enemy contradictions and which are internal contradictions among the people, and requiring everyone to distinguish between friends and enemies, directing the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile camps." The 8341 Unit's leftist support team immediately publicized and organized the study of this throughout the factory, helping both sides to further recognize that the contradictions between the two factions are internal contradictions among the people, making them realize the need to defeat factionalism and achieve revolutionary unity. The leftist support team also inspired them to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and solve problems according to the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity."

The 8341 Unit's leftist support team also helped the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, through the study of the "Old Five Articles," and the analysis of the manifestations of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, gradually draw a clear line between active ideological struggles and factional struggles. The leftist support team also used many facts to educate the workers, helping them further understand the harm of factional struggles. Everyone realized that factional struggles and active ideological struggles are two different things. Active ideological struggles "are weapons to achieve unity within the Party and revolutionary organizations, making them more effective in battle," while factional struggles destroy the unity of the revolutionary ranks, weaken the fighting strength of the revolutionary ranks, and objectively play a role in aiding the enemy, sometimes even being directly utilized by class enemies.

Through this series of work, in the minds of the broad revolutionary workers, factional struggles are no longer seen as some lofty "revolutionary action." The mask of factionalism has been peeled off, and factional struggles are increasingly opposed by revolutionary workers.

(2) Mobilize the masses to expose the evil results of factionalism, list the crimes of factionalism, and wage a "people's war" to annihilate factionalism, making factionalism lose its "market" among the masses.

In September last year, after the entire factory achieved revolutionary unity by workshop, class, and department, some leaders of mass organizations still had factional activities such as competing for positions and class leaders, obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary unity. The 8341 Unit's leftist support team followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Let the masses rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves," and further organized the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to launch an annihilation campaign against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

At that time, before and after classes, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary unity; in large and small meetings, they denounced factionalism and shouted slogans to defeat factionalism; broadcasts, slogans, and wall newspapers all attacked factionalism. Mao Zedong Thought study classes became important battlefields for eliminating factionalism.

The entire factory spent more than a week conducting an activity to draw portraits of factionalism. Revolutionary workers from various workshops, classes, and departments discussed the manifestations of factionalism, analyzed its essence and harm, exposed the evil results of factionalism, and listed the crimes of factionalism. Later, the leftist support team and the Revolutionary Committee of the Proletarian Revolutionaries compiled everyone's discussions into "Ten Major Crimes of Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism," listing various evil deeds of factionalism that interfered with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and hindered the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, such as: "Taking a utilitarian attitude towards the instructions of the proletarian headquarters," "With 'self' as the center and 'private' as the radius, competing for fame and profit, competing for power and position, and competing for fame," "Sacrificing revolutionary principles and not caring about the revolutionary whole," "Diverting the direction of the revolutionary struggle, making friends angry and enemies happy," etc.

After "Ten Major Crimes of Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism" was compiled, it was posted throughout the factory and distributed to each revolutionary worker, and discussions were organized again. The broad revolutionary workers recognized the ugly face of factionalism, and everyone hated and resisted factionalism.

(3) Run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, guide the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to take the lead in exposing and fighting selfishness, thoroughly expose the root of factionalism, and level the "mountains" of factionalism from the ideological level.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the 8341 Unit's leftist support team immediately organized the leaders of the original two revolutionary mass organizations to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on eliminating factionalism to expose and fight selfishness. These leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," realized: "Small-groupism... on the surface is not for the individual, but in reality, it contains extremely narrow individualism." Some people pointed out bluntly: "Engaging in factionalism is the same as engaging in individualism." "Severe factionalism is severe individualism." "The root of factionalism is the bourgeois 'self,' and engaging in factionalism is a malignant outbreak of bourgeois individualism."

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and in the meetings of the "Great Unity Committee," they followed Chairman Mao's teaching on "conducting open, mass self-criticism (each side only criticizes itself, not the other side)" and fiercely fought against their own factional selfish thoughts. Each person revealed their most secret "battle plans" from the past. Some people checked their wrong methods of competing for the core and seizing positions when forming the "Great Unity Committee," and fiercely fought against the wrong thoughts of "me as the core," etc. The more they fought, the more they hated factionalism; the more they fought, the more they hated the "self"; the more they fought, the more they felt they had wronged Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses. Later, they said: "The 'mountains' are the ones we built, and we must personally level them!" "Factionalism is what we instilled, and we must personally eliminate it!" The fifteen committee members of the "Great Unity Committee" sat shoulder to shoulder at the meeting of all revolutionary workers in the factory, competing to expose their own factionalism and fight their own selfish thoughts. Some behind-the-scenes plots and secret arrangements of factional activities were also revealed to the masses, and serious criticism was conducted.

After this meeting, the entire factory launched a wave of fighting factionalism and leveling "mountains." The broad revolutionary workers, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, in Mao Zedong Thought study classes and in workshop small group meetings, voluntarily investigated factionalism and fought selfish thoughts. Some comrades even individually found their "opponents" to make self-criticisms, achieving new unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

(4) Raise the struggle to eliminate factionalism to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao, inspiring the masses with deep class feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, consciously defeating factionalism.

The 8341 Unit's leftist support team repeatedly explained to the broad revolutionary workers: whether one consciously overcomes factionalism is a major issue related to whether one can follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation. The workers, through reviewing the development of the movement in the factory, also deeply felt: bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a "stumbling block" in the forward march of the current cultural revolution movement, and a major obstacle to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When factionalism erupts, Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be implemented, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment cannot be followed. Proletarian revolutionaries must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and must consciously break with factionalism!

The broad proletarian revolutionaries, with infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great orders, consciously abandoned the small calculations of pursuing factional interests. Some people, as soon as they discovered they had done something factional, immediately corrected it.

Before achieving revolutionary unity, both factions emphasized that the other side must publicly check their mistakes before unity. After the transmission of Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "each side making more self-criticisms, seeking great unity, and preserving small differences," put down the specific arguments, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity by workshop, class, and department. When selecting members of the workshop service team, some leaders of mass organizations had previously arranged to compete for positions and class leaders; later, realizing it was wrong, they went to persuade others to give up positions and class leaders. Originally, some members of "East Is Red" did not understand some actions of their organization that considered the overall situation and blamed the leader He Genlin for being "rightist" and "a traitor." He Genlin did not waver when he heard this but went to patiently persuade the person who raised the issue. Before the election of the Revolutionary Committee of the entire factory, the leader of "Red Rebels," who had more members, understood that some comrades in their organization did not want to elect some candidates originally from "East Is Red," and went to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them: "In places and units that need to seize power, the principle of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented, establishing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat." He persuaded and mobilized them to eliminate factionalism and consider the overall situation. The election results showed that all seventeen candidates were elected with more than half of the votes. Some comrades who gave up the position of class leader in some workshops initially felt a bit uncomfortable, but after studying Chairman Mao's works, they now actively support the work of comrades originally from the other faction.

Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses of Beijing Knitting Factory are closely united, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    8341部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员帮助革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想
    以毛主席最新指示为纲发动群众围剿派性
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在这个厂里已成“过街老鼠”，稍一露头就人人喊打。革命职工紧密团结，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    编者按：“搞派性，就是搞个人主义。”“派性的老根是资产阶级‘私’字，闹派性就是资产阶级个人主义的恶性发作。”
    北京针织总厂的同志们这几句话讲得多么深刻！它把派性的丑恶灵魂揭露无遗。
    要打倒派性，就非斗私不可，就非把资产阶级个人主义搞臭不可。
    要打倒派性，还一定要充分发动群众，历数派性罪状，大揭派性危害，人人批判，个个抵制，使它在群众中象“过街老鼠”，无处藏身。
    每一个无产阶级革命战士，都要以“斗私，批修”为纲，自觉地同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性决裂，坚定地站在无产阶级党性的立场，用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。这是全面落实毛主席最新指示、保证夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个关键问题。
    新华社十五日讯　首都新闻单位驻北京针织总厂联合记者组报道：人民解放军八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员，帮助全厂革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠狠打击资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。现在，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在这个厂里已经成为“过街老鼠”，稍一露头就人人喊打。广大革命职工摆脱了派性的影响，自觉地按照无产阶级党性处理问题。这对落实毛主席的一系列的极为重要的最新指示起了重大的作用。
      （一）引导革命群众分清两类不同性质的矛
  盾，掌握正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，划清积
  极的思想斗争和派性斗争的界限，剥掉资产阶
  级、小资产阶级派性的画皮。
    北京针织总厂原来的“红色造反者”和“东方红”两大革命群众组织，对于厂里的运动有某些不同的看法，有的本属正常的意见分歧。但是，双方在争论当中，有的人乱扣帽子，无限上纲，混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，并且不择手段地攻击对方，想把对方搞垮。这就陷入了派性斗争的泥坑。当时，有的人却说这是“坚持原则”，是“革命行动”，以致“内战”越打越凶，一度背离了毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    “必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”八三四一部队支左人员去年六月进厂以后，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，积极引导两派革命群众组织破除派性，增强党性，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    支左人员组织双方反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，引导他们分析厂里存在的矛盾，认清那是敌我矛盾，那是人民内部矛盾，要求大家分清敌友，把斗争的矛头对准党内一小撮走资派。
    毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”八三四一部队支左人员立即在全厂大力宣传，组织学习，使双方进一步认清了两派之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，使他们认识到必须打倒派性，实现革命大联合。支左人员又启发他们遵循毛主席的教导，按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式去解决问题。
    八三四一部队支左人员还帮助全厂革命群众，通过学习“老五篇”，以及剖析资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的表现，逐步划清了积极的思想斗争和派性斗争的界限。支左人员还用许多事实教育职工，使他们进一步了解派性斗争的危害。大家认识到，派性斗争和积极的思想斗争完全是两码事。积极的思想斗争，“它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器”，而派性斗争却在破坏革命队伍的团结，削弱革命队伍的战斗力，客观上起着援助敌人的作用，有时候还会直接为阶级敌人所利用。
    经过这一系列工作，在广大革命职工的心目中，派性斗争已不是什么崇高的“革命行动”。派性的画皮被剥掉了，派性斗争越来越受到革命职工的反对。
      （二）广泛发动群众，大揭派性的恶果，大
  摆派性的罪状，打一场围歼派性的“人民战争”，
  使派性在群众中名声扫地，失去“市场”。
    去年九月，全厂按车间、班组、科室实现革命大联合以后，某些群众组织负责人还有争席位、争组长等派性活动，妨碍着毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示的落实。八三四一部队支左人员遵循毛主席“要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己”的教导，进一步组织全厂革命群众对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性展开围歼战。
    当时，班前、班后，都学习毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示；大会、小会，都谴责派性，喊打倒派性的口号；广播、标语、墙报一齐向派性进攻。毛泽东思想学习班，成为破除派性的重要战场。
    全厂用一个多星期的时间，开展了一场为派性画像的活动。各车间、班组、科室的革命职工，都议论派性的表现，分析派性的实质及其危害，大揭派性的恶果，大摆派性的罪状。后来，支左人员和无产阶级革命派大联合委员会把大家讨论的意见，归纳成《资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的十大罪状》，列举了派性干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署、妨碍毛主席的最新指示落实的种种罪恶，如：“对无产阶级司令部的指示，采取实用主义的态度”、“以‘我’为圆心，‘私’字为半径，争名争利，争权争位，争出风头”、“牺牲革命原则，不顾革命整体”、“转移了革命斗争的大方向，使亲者痛、仇者快”，等等。
    《资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的十大罪状》整理出来以后，张贴全厂，并印发给每个革命职工，再次组织讨论。广大革命职工认清了派性的丑恶面目，大家厌恶派性，憎恨派性，自觉地抵制派性。
      （三）办好毛泽东思想学习班，引导革命群
  众组织负责人带头亮私斗私，大挖派性的老根，
  把派性彻底搞臭，从思想上平掉派性的“山头”。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，八三四一部队支左人员立即组织原来两派革命群众组织的负责人，参加毛泽东思想学习班，围绕破除派性，进行亮私斗私。这些革命群众组织负责人，经过学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，认识到：“小团体主义。……表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义”。有的人一针见血地指出：“搞派性，就是搞个人主义。”“派性严重，就是个人主义严重。”“派性的老根是资产阶级‘私’字，闹派性就是资产阶级个人主义的恶性发作。”
    他们在毛泽东思想学习班里，在“大联委”的会上，遵照毛主席关于“实行公开的群众性的自我批评
  （各方面只批评自己，不批评对方）”的教导，狠斗自己闹派性的私心杂念。各自亮出了过去最保密的“作战计划”。有的人检查了在组成“大联委”时争核心、抢席位的错误作法，狠斗了“以我为核心”等错误思想。越斗，越觉得派性可恨；越斗，越觉得“私”字可恶；越斗，越觉得对不起毛主席，对不起广大革命群众。后来，他们说：“‘山头’是我们垒起来的，我们就得亲手去平！”“派性是我们灌下去的，我们就得自己去消除！”“大联委”的十五个委员来到全厂革命职工大会上，肩并肩地坐在一起，争着亮自己的派性，斗自己的私心。一些背后策划、暗中布置的派性活动，也把真相亮在群众面前，进行严肃的批判。
    这次大会以后，全厂又掀起了一个斗派性、平“山头”的热潮。广大革命职工以毛主席的最新指示为武器，在毛泽东思想学习班里，在车间小组会上，自动查派性，斗私心。有些同志还个别找自己的“对头”做自我批评，在毛泽东思想的基础上达到了新的团结。
      （四）把破除派性的斗争，提到忠
  于毛主席、紧跟毛主席的高度，启发群
  众以无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东
  思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命
  路线的深厚阶级感情，自觉地去打倒派
  性。
    八三四一部队支左人员，反复地向广大革命职工说明：是不是自觉地克服派性，是关系到能不能紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的重大问题，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。职工们通过回顾厂里运动发展的情况，也深切地体会到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是当前文化大革命运动前进道路上的“绊脚石”，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的极大障碍。派性发作的时候，毛主席的最新指示就执行不了，毛主席的伟大战略部署就不能紧跟。无产阶级革命派要无限忠于毛主席，要做毛主席的好战士，就得自觉地同派性决裂！
    广大无产阶级革命派怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，坚决执行毛主席的伟大号令，自觉地放弃了追求派别利益的小算盘。有的人一发现自己做了闹派性的事，马上就去纠正。
    在实现革命大联合以前，两派都强调对方要公开检查错误才能联合。毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示传达以后，他们遵循毛主席关于“各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，放下具体问题的争论，迅速实现了按车间、班组、科室的革命大联合。在选车间勤务组成员的时候，有的群众组织负责人曾经布置要争席位，争组长；后来，认识到不对，又去动员让席位，让组长。原来“东方红”里的个别成员，对于本组织某些顾全大局的作法一时不理解，责怪负责人贺根林“右倾”，“当了叛徒”。贺根林听了也不动摇，而是去耐心说服提意见的人。在选举总厂革命委员会前夕，原来人数较多的“红色造反者”的负责人邢云有，了解到本组织里有部分同志不愿意选原属“东方红”的某些候选人，就去向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。”说服动员他们消除派性，照顾大局。选举结果，十七名候选人全部以超过半数票当选。有的车间让了组长的同志，开始心情有些不舒畅，经过学习毛主席著作，现在已能积极支持原属另一派的同志开展工作。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，北京针织总厂的广大革命群众紧密团结，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
