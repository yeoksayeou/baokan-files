The rise of armed revolutionary struggle in India marks a great turning point in the history of the Indian revolution, and the revolutionary situation in India is better than ever.

According to a commentary by a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: Last year was a year of historic turning points in the Indian revolution. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Indian people finally embarked on the only correct path of the Indian revolution—the victorious path of armed seizure of power led by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary line executed by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India (CPI) is achieving victories step by step, while the "peaceful transition" line pushed by the Indian revisionists is increasingly bankrupt. The revolutionary situation in India is better than ever.

India, a major Asian country with a population of 500 million, holds a very important strategic position in the world revolution of the proletariat. The great Lenin pointed out as early as 40 years ago: "The outcome of the struggle will ultimately depend on this: Russia, India, China, etc., which constitute the overwhelming majority of the world's population." Now, the revolutionary faction of the CPI is leading the Indian revolutionary people to resolutely take the path of the Chinese revolution, using armed revolution to combat armed counter-revolution. This is not only a great turning point in the history of the Indian revolution but also of great significance in the development of the world revolution of the proletariat.

For a long time, there has been a struggle between two lines and two paths within the CPI. In recent years, the struggle has become even more intense. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary faction of the CPI has resolutely opposed the traitor Dange group, which has usurped the leadership of the party, and a small clique of revisionist leaders represented by Nambudiripad and Jyoti Basu, who have been pushing the "peaceful transition" parliamentary road.

The revolutionary faction of the CPI has firmly declared: "The strategy adopted by the great leader Mao Zedong is the one that Indian Marxists should adopt." They want to "make serious efforts to become good students of Comrade Mao Zedong." They have clearly pointed out, in accordance with Chairman Mao's brilliant teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," that the only path for the people's democratic revolution in India is: under the leadership of the proletariat, through a land revolution, to establish revolutionary base areas in rural regions; then to expand these revolutionary base areas to encircle the cities; to organize the People's Liberation Army from peasant guerrilla units; and to seize the cities to lead the revolution to victory.

The revolutionary faction of the CPI has gone deep into rural areas where feudal exploitation is particularly severe and revolutionary forces are strong, such as Darjeeling District, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the peasants, mobilize the peasants, arm the peasants, and prepare for armed peasant uprisings.

In early last year, a thunderous roar echoed across the land of India. The revolutionary faction of the CPI led the revolutionary peasants of Darjeeling District and other regions, such as Naxalbari, to ignite the sparks of armed struggle.

They led the landless and poor peasants of Darjeeling District, who had long suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords, to launch a stormy attack on the landlords, plantation owners, and the reactionary government, seizing land, guns, and grain from them. They also organized armed groups, established "people's courts," and punished the stubborn landlords and evil gentry, protecting the fruits of the land revolution with arms. From March to June last year, there were 220 instances of violent actions by peasants, shattering the privileges of feudal landlords and foreign plantation owners that had lasted for thousands of years and hundreds of years, respectively, as well as the "laws" and "order" imposed on them by the reactionary government. The dignity and prestige of the landlords and plantation owners were swept away, and the landless and poor peasants held their heads high, feeling proud and confident. This movement terrified the Indian reactionaries.

The armed struggle of the Naxalbari peasants greatly inspired the revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary people of India. Revolutionaries in various places established "Committees to Support the Naxalbari Peasant Struggle," mobilizing the people to support the armed revolution. They translated and published a large number of works by Chairman Mao, spreading Mao Zedong Thought, and published many periodicals, books, and leaflets, propagating the truth of armed seizure of power and exposing the actions of a small clique of revisionists within the party who were sabotaging the armed struggle. Many revolutionaries took the revolutionary faction of the CPI in Darjeeling District as an example, going deep into the countryside to work hard to "develop Naxalbari-style movements" and establish "more Naxalbaris."

The flames of the peasant movement quickly spread across the vast rural areas of India. According to incomplete news from Indian newspapers, "Naxalbari-style" peasant land struggles have already been launched in 50 regions within eight states and centrally administered territories. These indicate that the Indian revolution has entered a vibrant stage.

Last year was also the year when the "parliamentary road" of the Indian revisionists, represented by Nambudiripad and Jyoti Basu, was greatly exposed and bankrupt. This "parliamentary road" is a mixture of the "peaceful transition" fallacy of the old revisionists Bernstein and Kautsky and Gandhi's "non-violence." The Soviet revisionist clique and the Chinese Khrushchev strongly supported and vigorously promoted this "parliamentary road," also known as the "Indian road," in an attempt to prevent the Indian people and other oppressed nations and peoples from taking the victorious path of the Chinese revolution.

The Indian revisionists sold out to the Indian reactionaries, guaranteeing that they would not use force to overthrow the Indian reactionary government. The Indian reactionaries saw that these people could be used as tools to implement the reactionary policies of the Congress Party and to adorn the "democratic" facade of the Congress Party, allowing them to participate in the "general election" held in February last year. They also allowed them to participate in the so-called "non-Congress Party government" formed in West Bengal and Kerala, giving them official positions. The Indian revisionists were overjoyed, thinking that the "parliamentary road" was on the verge of success, and boasted about establishing what they called a "people's government." They tried to use these two states as models to promote nationwide, hoping to seize national power through voting in the next election. However, just nine months later, the West Bengal government, which had lost its deceptive effect, was dissolved on the order of the central government.

In the process of pushing the "parliamentary road," the Indian revisionists fully exposed themselves as shameful traitors and accomplices of the Indian reactionaries. The reactionary government in which the Indian revisionists participated suppressed the revolutionary movement of the Indian people, killing many revolutionary people. Their hands were stained with the blood of the people. The "parliamentary road" of the Indian revisionists once again failed in last year's "trial." This is not only a heavy blow to these Indian revisionists but also a slap in the face of the Soviet revisionist clique and the Chinese Khrushchev.

The fact that the revolutionary line is achieving victories step by step in India and the revisionist line is increasingly bankrupt portends a bright future for the development of the Indian revolution.

The current main tasks of the Indian revolution, as proposed by the revolutionary faction of the CPI, are: to spread Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, among the people; to continue the struggle against new and old revisionism; to analyze the objective conditions of India concretely based on the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought; to formulate the program and strategy of the Indian revolution on this basis; and to promote the peasant revolutionary struggle and develop Naxalbari-style movements. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of India will surely achieve even greater victories in the future struggles!

    粉碎印修分子“和平过渡”的反革命路线　坚决走武装夺取政权的革命道路
    印度革命派在毛泽东思想指引下打开一条胜利之路
    印度革命武装斗争的兴起是印度革命史上一个伟大转折点，印度革命形势空前大好
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：去年，是印度革命发生历史性转折的一年。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，印度人民终于走上了印度革命的唯一正确道路——毛主席领导中国人民武装夺取政权的胜利道路。印共革命派执行的革命路线正在节节胜利，印度修正主义分子推行的“和平过渡”路线日益破产。印度的革命形势空前大好。
    具有五亿人口的亚洲大国印度，在无产阶级世界革命中占有十分重要的战略地位。伟大的列宁早在四十年前就指出：“斗争的结局归根到底取决于这一点：俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口的绝大多数。”现在，印共革命派领导印度革命人民，决心走中国革命的道路，用武装的革命反对武装的反革命。这不仅在印度的革命史上是一个伟大的转折点，而且在无产阶级世界革命的发展中具有重大的意义。
    长期以来，印共党内一直存在着两条路线、两条道路的斗争，近几年来斗争更加剧烈。在毛泽东思想的指引下，印共革命派坚决反对窃踞党的领导地位的叛徒丹吉集团和以南布迪里巴德、乔蒂·巴苏为代表的一小撮修正主义头目推行“和平过渡”的议会道路。
    印共革命派坚定地宣布：“伟大的领袖毛泽东所采取的战略，是印度的马克思主义者应该采取的。”他们要“认真努力成为毛泽东同志的好学生”。他们按照毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明教导，明确指出：印度“人民民主革命的唯一道路是：在无产阶级领导下，通过土地革命，在农村地区建立革命根据地；随后扩大这些革命根据地来包围城市；从农民游击队中组织人民解放军；用夺取城市来导致革命走向胜利。”
    印共革命派深入到封建剥削特别严重、革命力量较强的大吉岭县等农村地区，向农民宣传毛泽东思想，发动农民、组织农民、武装农民，准备发动农民武装起义。
    去年初，印度大地上一声春雷，印共革命派发动大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区的革命农民，点燃了武装斗争的星星之火。
    他们领导大吉岭县受尽地主压迫、剥削的无地少地农民，向地主、种植园主和反动政府发动了急风暴雨式的攻击，向他们夺地、夺枪、夺粮。他们还组织起武装小组，建立“人民法庭”，惩办顽抗的土豪劣绅，武装保卫土地革命的果实。从去年三月份到六月份，农民采取的暴力行动达二百二十起，把几千年封建地主和百年来外国种植园主的特权以及反动政府强加在他们头上的“法律”和“秩序”打得落花流水，把地主、种植园主的体面威风，扫地以尽；无地少地的农民，昂然抬起头来，扬眉吐气。这个运动吓得印度反动派惊慌失措。
    纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争极大地鼓舞了印共革命派和印度革命人民。印度革命者在各地成立了“支援纳萨尔巴里农民斗争委员会”，动员人民支持武装革命。他们翻译和出版了大量的毛主席著作，传播毛泽东思想，出版了许多种刊物、书籍和印发传单，宣传武装夺取政权的真理，揭露党内一小撮修正主义分子破坏武装斗争的行径。许多革命者以大吉岭县的印共革命派为榜样，深入农村，为“发展纳萨尔巴里式的运动”和建立“更多的纳萨尔巴里”而艰苦奋斗。
    农民运动的怒火迅速在印度的广大农村地区蔓延。据印度报纸透露的很不完全的消息，“纳萨尔巴里式”的农民土地斗争已经在八个邦和中央直属领地内的五十个地区内开展。这些表明，印度革命已经出现了一个生气蓬勃的局面。
    去年，也是以南布迪里巴德和乔蒂·巴苏为代表的印修分子的“议会道路”大暴露、大破产的一年。这条“议会道路”是老牌修正主义分子伯恩斯坦、考茨基的“和平过渡”谬论和印度甘地“非暴力主义”的混合物。苏修叛徒集团和中国赫鲁晓夫大力支持和极力宣扬这条“议会道路”，即所谓“印度道路”，借以阻止印度人民和其他被压迫民族和被压迫人民走中国革命胜利的道路。
    印度修正主义分子向印度反动派卖身投靠，保证绝不用武力推翻印度反动政府。印度反动派看到这批家伙既可以用来作为执行国大党反动政策的工具，又可以用来装潢国大党“民主”的门面，让他们参加了去年二月间举行的“大选”。并且让他们参加在西孟加拉和喀拉拉两个邦组成的所谓“非国大党政府”，让他们当官。印度修正主义分子为此欢喜若狂，以为“议会道路”成功在望，鼓吹他们成立了什么“人民政府”。并力图把这两个邦作为活样板，向全国推广，幻想在下届选举时通过投票，夺取全国政权。但是，仅仅过了九个月，失去了欺骗作用的西孟加拉邦政府就被中央政府一声令下解散掉。
    印修分子在他们推行“议会道路”的过程中，充分暴露出他们是可耻的叛徒、印度反动派的帮凶。印修分子参与的反动政权镇压印度人民革命运动，残杀了许多革命人民。他们的双手沾满了人民的鲜血。印度修正主义分子的“议会道路”在去年的“试点”中又一次大破产。这不仅是对这些印修分子的沉重打击，而且是对苏修叛徒集团和中国赫鲁晓夫的当头一棒。
    革命路线在印度节节胜利，修正主义路线在印度日益破产的生动事实，预示出印度革命发展的光明前景。
    印共革命派提出当前印度革命主要任务是：在人民中传播当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想；再接再厉地进行反对新老修正主义的斗争；按照光辉的毛泽东思想对印度的客观条件进行具体的分析，并在这个基础上，制订印度革命的纲领和策略；推动农民革命斗争，发展纳萨尔巴里式的运动。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，印度革命人民必将在今后斗争中获得更伟大胜利！
