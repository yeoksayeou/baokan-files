The invincible victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the shining achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: In Hebei Province, nine regions and over ninety counties and cities have established revolutionary committees.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 28th: Surrounding the capital, Hebei Province has recently had continuous good news of establishing regional and county/city revolutionary committees. So far, out of the province's ten regions and over 150 counties and cities, nine regions including Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Cangzhou, Hengshui, Xingtai, and Handan, and over ninety counties and cities have established revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs—revolutionary committees. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people across the province are enthusiastically cheering: This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a shining achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Hebei Province have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they directed their struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Hebei Province. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China, with the help of the People's Liberation Army of China, who are carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" work, they actively learned and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making new developments in revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees of Shijiazhuang and the other eight regions are generally established on the basis of the unity of more than 90% of the revolutionary masses.

After the establishment of regional, municipal, and county revolutionary committees, they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and become command centers for organizing and leading the masses to fight against class enemies and nature. The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in various regions have closely united around the revolutionary committees, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various fields.

After the establishment of regional, municipal, and county revolutionary committees, they immediately set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, leading the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. At present, the nine regions that have established revolutionary committees have set up more than ten million various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over five million revolutionary cadres, organizational leaders, and revolutionary people participating in the study. They use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fiercely combat the "self" in their minds, and besiege bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, promoting and consolidating revolutionary great unity.

The newly established regional, municipal, and county revolutionary committees pay attention to strengthening class education, conducting reminiscences and comparisons, achieving ideological and organizational revolutionization, and establishing new revolutionary customs. Many members of the revolutionary committees in various places follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person," often going deep among the masses, participating in labor, consulting with the masses on matters, and being the masses' students, establishing a new leadership style and a new type of cadre-mass relationship, which has been praised by the masses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 26th: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Shijiazhuang City has always been at the forefront of revolution and production, making tremendous contributions. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, setting an example for the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in the locality.

From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in the factories, mines, and enterprises of Shijiazhuang launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee and the Shijiazhuang Regional Committee who are taking the capitalist road. The broad revolutionary workers firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Some workers, risking their lives, escorted the young Red Guards to Beijing to see the great leader Chairman Mao. The handful of power-holders within the Party, feeling that their downfall was imminent, vigorously promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, creating a white terror to try to extinguish the revolutionary flames. Many workers suffered cruel persecution and suppression. Revolutionary workers firmly said: "The capitalist-roaders can destroy our bodies, but they can never destroy our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao!" The broad revolutionary workers persisted in the struggle, together with the Red Guards and other revolutionary people, launched an even more fierce attack on the capitalist-roaders. Under the inspiration of the "January Revolution Storm" in 1967, the curtain was raised on the struggle for power. After the People's Liberation Army intervened in the Shijiazhuang Cultural Revolution in 1967, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the revolutionary cadres, and launched a tenacious struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party became even more panicked. They spread rumors, instigated discord, and used the anarchist thoughts of some people to incite the "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything" ultra-leftist tide, directing the spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army. The broad revolutionary workers timely exposed the enemy's conspiracy, united with the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, and resolutely fought against this ultra-leftist tide. They extensively carried out "support the army and love the people" activities, firmly safeguarding the prestige of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, they correctly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, actively approached the deceived masses, and together with them studied Chairman Mao's works and instructions, helping them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and once again foiled the enemy's fierce counterattack.

"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do!" With infinite class feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class of Shijiazhuang, in every stage of the Cultural Revolution, has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, leading the broad revolutionary masses on all fronts to advance victoriously. The great leader Chairman Mao issued instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The revolutionary workers of Shijiazhuang quickly launched a wave of studying, discussing, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions. The railway system's revolutionary workers took the lead, achieving revolutionary great unity. Following this, more than a hundred factories, mines, and enterprises quickly achieved revolutionary great unity by system, department, and team. Many factory workers actively introduced their experiences of achieving revolutionary great unity to the revolutionary masses in schools and party and government departments, helping revolutionary mass organizations to do more self-criticism. Under the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary mass organizations in various fields such as education, culture, health, and party and government departments also quickly achieved revolutionary great unity, forming a vast cultural revolutionary army with the working class as the main body throughout the city. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism," the working class of Shijiazhuang enthusiastically responded, successively setting up more than 1,400 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than ten million people participating in the study. The broad revolutionary workers fiercely combated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, firmly established proletarian party spirit, greatly promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The working class of Shijiazhuang is both a revolutionary pioneer and a model of production. In March 1967, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a letter to revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in factories and mines across the country, the broad revolutionary workers were full of enthusiasm and overfulfilled the first quarter's industrial production plan. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party jumped out, inciting some people to leave their production posts, attempting to sabotage production and the Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary workers united as one, firmly guarded their production posts, repelled the enemy's attack, defended Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and completed the 1967 full-year industrial production plan ahead of schedule. The output of more than 40 major products increased significantly, and the quality of the products improved.

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成果
    河北省九个地区九十多个县市建立革命委员会
    石家庄工人阶级无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想，站在革命和生产最前列，成为当地文化革命大军的主体，为广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众树立了榜样
    据新华社保定二十八日电　地处首都周围的河北省，最近几个月中接二连三地传出建立地区和县、市革命委员会的喜讯。到目前为止，全省十个地区、一百五十多个县市中，已经有石家庄、天津、承德、张家口、唐山、沧州、衡水、邢台、邯郸九个地区和九十多个县、市建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构——革命委员会。全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众热烈地欢呼：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成果！
    河北省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从无产阶级文化大革命一开始，就把斗争矛头指向河北省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示下达后，在担任“三支”、
  “两军”工作的中国人民解放军的帮助下，他们积极学习和贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，使革命的大联合和革命的三结合有了新的发展。石家庄等九个地区的革命委员会，一般都是在百分之九十以上的革命群众联合起来的基础上建立的。
    各地、市、县革命委员会建立以后，遵循毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，成为组织、领导群众向阶级敌人和大自然进行斗争的指挥部。各地区的无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧紧团结在革命委员会周围，以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在各个领域里散布的反革命修正主义黑货。
    各地、市、县革命委员会建立以后，立即开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，领导群众活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。目前，建立革命委员会的九个地区已经开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班十万多个，参加学习的革命领导干部、群众组织负责人和革命群众达五百多万人。他们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，狠斗自己头脑中的私字，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，促进和巩固了革命大联合。
    新成立的各地、市、县革命委员会，都注意加强阶级教育，进行回忆对比，实现思想革命化和机关革命化，树立新的革命风尚。各地革命委员会的许多成员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，经常深入群众，参加劳动，遇事和群众商量，做群众的小学生，树立起崭新的领导作风，建立新型的干群关系，受到了群众的赞扬。
    据新华社保定二十六日电　河北省石家庄市的工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终站在革命和生产的最前列，做出了巨大的贡献。他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为当地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众树立了榜样。
    从无产阶级文化大革命一开始，石家庄厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，就积极向石家庄地委和石家庄市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了猛烈的进攻。广大革命职工坚决支持红卫兵的革命行动，有的工人冒着生命危险，护送红卫兵小将去北京见伟大领袖毛主席。党内一小撮走资派感到自己即将垮台，就大肆推行资产阶级反动路线，制造白色恐怖，企图扑灭革命的烈火。许多工人受到残酷的打击和迫害。革命派工人坚定地说：“走资派可以摧残我们的身体，却永远摧残不了我们忠于毛主席的红心！”广大革命职工坚持斗争，同红卫兵和其他革命群众一起，更猛烈地向走资派开火，在去年“一月革命风暴”的鼓舞下，揭开了夺权斗争的序幕。去年，中国人民解放军介入石家庄文化大革命以后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，向党内一小撮走资派进行顽强的斗争。这时，党内一小撮走资派更加恐慌，他们制造谣言，挑拨离间，利用一部分人的无政府主义思想，煽起“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的极“左”思潮，把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军。广大革命职工及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，和红卫兵、革命群众团结一致，同这一股极“左”思潮进行了坚决斗争。他们广泛开展“拥军爱民”活动，坚决维护人民解放军的威信。同时，正确地区分两类不同性质的矛盾，主动地接近受蒙蔽的群众，同他们一起学习毛主席著作和毛主席的指示，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，又一次粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂反扑。
      “毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么办！”石家庄工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的阶级感情，在文化大革命的每个阶段，都紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，带动各条战线的广大革命群众胜利前进。伟大领袖毛主席发出指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”石家庄的革命职工迅速掀起大学习、大讨论、大落实的热潮。铁路系统的革命职工一马当先，实现了革命大联合。接着，一百多个厂矿企业也迅速实现了按系统、按部门、按班组的革命大联合。许多工厂的职工主动向学校、党政部门的革命群众介绍实现革命大联合的经验，帮助革命群众组织多做自我批评。在工人阶级的带动下，文教卫生、党政部门等各条战线的革命群众组织也纷纷实现革命大联合，在全市形成了以工人阶级为主体的浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，石家庄工人阶级热烈响应，陆续办起了一千四百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有十多万人参加了学习。广大革命职工狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，大大促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    石家庄工人阶级既是革命的闯将，又是生产的模范。一九六七年三月，中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信发表以后，广大革命职工干劲倍增，一举超额完成了第一季度工业生产计划。这时候，党内一小撮走资派跳了出来，挑动一些群众脱离生产岗位，企图破坏生产，破坏文化大革命。广大革命职工团结一致，坚守生产岗位，击退了阶级敌人的进攻，捍卫了毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针，提前完成了一九六七年全市工业生产计划，四十多种主要产品的产量都有大幅度的增长，产品质量都有提高。
