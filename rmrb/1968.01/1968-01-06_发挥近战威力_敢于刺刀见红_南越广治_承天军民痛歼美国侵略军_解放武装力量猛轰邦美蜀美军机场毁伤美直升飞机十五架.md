The people and armed forces of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region in South Vietnam have inflicted heavy losses on the U.S. aggressors, giving them a severe blow.

On December 26 last year, the enemy dispatched two infantry battalions and one armored battalion to "sweep" Hai An Commune in Hai Lang District, Quang Tri Province. As soon as the enemy arrived, the Quang Tri Provincial Liberation Army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, annihilating more than 200 enemy troops and seizing a large quantity of weapons and ammunition.

The next day, the Quang Tri Provincial Liberation Army bravely intercepted the U.S. Marine Corps' 1st Division, 1st Regiment, 3rd Battalion, which had rushed from Da Nang to reinforce the enemy. They annihilated more than 200 U.S. aggressors and shot down two helicopters. In this battle, the Liberation Army soldiers demonstrated the close combat power of the people's army, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy and forcing them to flee in disarray.

The guerrillas in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region have been widely waging a people's war, continuously striking at the enemy. In the more than 20 days from November 27 to December 22 last year, they annihilated more than 1,200 U.S. and puppet troops.

The guerrillas in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region have demonstrated flexible tactics, repeatedly penetrating heavily guarded enemy strongholds, killing and wounding many U.S. and puppet troops. In four battles to attack the enemy stronghold at Phu Lai, the U.S. military wharf and restaurant in Hue City, the U.S. aggressors stationed in the Di Linh area, and the puppet 9th and 12th "pacification" units stationed in the Chau Tho area, they annihilated nearly 220 U.S. and puppet troops. In the battles to shell the enemy bases at Vung Tau, Phong Dinh, and Bai Son, they annihilated nearly 500 U.S. and puppet troops. They also ambushed the enemy on various transportation lines, annihilating nearly 200 enemy troops, most of whom were U.S. aggressors, and destroying or damaging 10 military vehicles.

In Gia Dinh Province, the people's liberation armed forces launched consecutive attacks on the puppet military strongholds in Go Vap District and Cu Chi District on December 11, 12, and 19 last year, annihilating 410 enemy troops, including 250 U.S. aggressors, completely wiping out a puppet company, shooting down two enemy planes, and seizing a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

In My Tho Province, the people's liberation armed forces repulsed the U.S. bandits' "sweep" of Bac Son Village on December 25 last year, sinking two warships and annihilating all the U.S. bandits on board.

According to a report from Saigon, the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. military airfield in Ban Me Thuot, the capital of Dac Lac Province in the Central Highlands, at dawn on the 4th. Preliminary reports indicate that 15 U.S. military helicopters were destroyed or damaged. At the same time, the people's liberation armed forces also shelled the An Khe base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the Central Highlands, destroying or damaging many U.S. planes. While shelling the Ban Me Thuot U.S. military airfield, the people's liberation armed forces also launched a surprise attack on the city of Ban Me Thuot, launching fierce attacks on the U.S. and puppet military and the puppet provincial government's institutions. Many U.S. and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and the puppet governor was almost killed.
