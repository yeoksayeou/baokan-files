The revolution is continuously deepening and developing. Currently, the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie has become the main obstacle to the further development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If factionalism is placed above everything else, it will blind one's eyes, making it impossible to see the situation clearly, distinguish the direction, or tell friends from enemies. At present, the most vicious tactic of the class enemy is to hide their reactionary faces, with some taking the stage under the banner of "rebellion," others blowing cold winds from behind the scenes, spreading rumors, and still others infiltrating revolutionary ranks to seize leadership, create divisions, incite "internal wars," and reap benefits from the chaos. Some comrades in our ranks are entangled by this poisonous snake of factionalism, leading to confusion between humans and monsters, and a reversal of right and wrong. They throw away the interests of the proletariat, revolutionary great unity, and the three-in-one combination, focusing only on the interests of their own faction. This opens the door wide for the enemy's sabotage. Factionalism can even achieve what the class enemy cannot. There are many painful lessons from this.

A large amount of evidence shows that wherever the "internal wars" between the two factions are intense, it is where bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is rampant. In such places, nine out of ten have bad elements using factionalism to create trouble and chaos. Our school achieved revolutionary great unity in September last year during the high tide of revolutionary great unity. Before the unity, "internal wars" were constant and escalating. The result was that we were exhausted while the enemy was at ease. After uniting, we fiercely fought against selfishness and swept away factionalism. From the original two major factions, we exposed a handful of bad elements. Among them were blood-stained Kuomintang spies, traitors who colluded with foreign countries, traitors, and monsters. These demons used our factionalism and the intensification of "internal wars," taking advantage of our lack of attention, to appear in an ultra-leftist guise. They infiltrated the two revolutionary mass organizations, siding with one faction and attacking another, spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, and creating chaos. This brought great losses to our school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, causing it to experience multiple setbacks. Of course, this also further exposed the reactionary face of the class enemy, gradually enlightening our eyes.

The severe facts of class struggle once again tell us: the deeper the revolution develops, the greater the harm that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism brings to the revolution. If we allow this big poisonous snake of factionalism to continue to entangle us, it will bring incalculable losses to the revolution. The New Year's editorial pointed out: "Whether or not one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." Following that, the article "Proletarian Revolutionaries, Unite!" sounded the alarm for us, making us more vigilant. Currently, it is necessary to launch a thorough suppression of this major enemy of factionalism.

    绝不给敌人开方便之门
    上海师范学院革命造反总指挥部
    革命在不断深入发展。当前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性已经成了无产阶级文化大革命进一步发展的主要障碍。派性高于一切，就会蒙住了眼睛，看不清形势，辨不明方向，分不清敌友。目前阶级敌人最恶毒的一招，就是：掩着自己狰狞的反动嘴脸，有的打着“造反”的旗号，登台表演；有的躲在幕后刮阴风，造谣言；有的钻进革命队伍，篡夺领导权，制造分裂，挑动“内战”，从中渔利。我们队伍中有些同志被派性这条毒蛇缠身，弄得人妖不分，是非颠倒，把革命大联合、革命三结合、无产阶级的利益，统统丢在脑后，眼前只看到我这一派的利益。这就给敌人的破坏大开方便之门。派性甚至起了阶级敌人所起不到的作用。这种惨痛的教训是不少的。
    大量的事实证明：凡是两派“内战”激烈的地方和单位，就是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性恶性膨胀的地方和单位，那里十之八九有坏人在利用派性进行破坏和捣乱。我院在去年九月革命大联合高潮中实现了革命的大联合。联合以前，
  “内战”不断，逐步升级。结果是自己精疲力尽，敌人逍遥自在。这次联合起来以后，狠斗私字，横扫派性，从原来的两大派组织中揪出了一小撮坏人。其中有的是血债累累的国民党特务、里通外国的叛国分子，有的是叛徒，有的是牛鬼蛇神。这些魑魅魍魉，就是利用我们派性发作、
  “内战”激化、无暇他顾时，以极“左”的面目出现，趁机混入两派革命群众组织中，拉一派，打一派，造谣生事，挑拨离间，兴风作浪。这样就给我院无产阶级文化大革命带来了巨大的损失，使我院无产阶级文化大革命出现了多次反复。当然，这又进一步暴露了阶级敌人的反动面目，逐步地擦亮了我们的眼睛。
    严峻的阶级斗争事实，再一次告诉我们：革命越深入发展，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性对革命的危害也就越大。假如我们再让派性这条大毒蛇继续缠在身上，那就会给革命带来不可估量的损失。元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”接着，《无产阶级革命派，联合起来》这篇文章，又为我们敲响了警钟，使我们更加警惕起来。当前对派性这一大敌，确有痛加围剿之必要。
