The patriotic armed forces of Laos fearlessly sacrificed and bravely fought, striking down and destroying 287 American aircraft of various types in 1967, 94 more than in 1966.

The report said that many of the aircraft were shot down by Laotian patriotic military and civilians using light weapons.

The guerrilla forces and local armed forces in Xieng Khouang Province used light weapons to shoot down five American helicopters on August 1, 1967. These helicopters were transporting a group of special forces to a certain area in the province to carry out a nibbling attack. The patriotic armed forces in Sam Neua Province shot down one American aircraft and injured another with six rifle bullets on September 30, 1967.

The report said that the patriotic armed forces in Xam Neua Province shot down an American RB-66 type aircraft for the first time on August 22, 1967. The three American air pirates on board, including a major and a captain, were killed or captured.

The report said that the most outstanding achievement of the Laotian patriotic armed forces in 1967 was the two attacks on the Luang Prabang Airport on July 17 and July 26, destroying nearly 30 American aircraft and killing nearly 100 enemy soldiers. (Accompanied by a picture)

The anti-aircraft forces of the Lao People's Liberation Army, using the strategy of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy, severely punished the American air pirates and achieved brilliant results.

    新华社康开二十九日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国武装力量在去年共击落击毁各种类型的美国飞机二百八十七架，比一九六六年多九十四架。
    报道说，许多飞机是被老挝爱国军民用轻武器击落的。
    沙湾拿吉省游击队和地方武装力量去年八月一日使用轻武器击落五架美国直升飞机，这些飞机是把一批别动队运送到这个省的某个地区去进行蚕食进攻的。桑怒省爱国武装力量在去年九月三十日用六发步枪子弹击落一架美机，击伤另一架美机。
    报道说，川圹省爱国武装力量在去年八月二十二日第一次击落美国RB—66型飞机一架，机上的三个美国空中强盗包括一名少校和一名上尉被打死或被俘。
    报道说，老挝爱国武装力量去年最突出的一个战绩是在七月十七日和七月二十六日对琅勃拉邦机场进行了两次袭击，共击毁近三十架美国飞机，歼敌近百名。（附图片）
