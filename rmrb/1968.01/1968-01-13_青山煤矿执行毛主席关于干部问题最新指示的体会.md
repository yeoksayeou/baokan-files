The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres of Qing Shan Mine, Pingxiang Mining Bureau, under the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops stationed at the mine, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue. They established a new relationship between cadres and the masses using Mao Zedong Thought. Cadres and the masses united as one, and the revolutionary spirit and production enthusiasm soared.

“Kicking” and “Helping”

In the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, many cadres at Qing Shan Mine, due to the instigation and deception by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, stood on the wrong side, and there was severe antagonism between cadres and the masses. Should these cadres who made mistakes be kicked out or helped?

Chairman Mao teaches us: In dealing with comrades who have made mistakes, whether to adopt an attitude of enmity or an attitude of help is a criterion to distinguish whether a person has good intentions or bad intentions. The proletarian revolutionaries at Qing Shan Mine realized that whether to “kick” or “help” cadres who made mistakes is a struggle between the two lines, whether to implement or not implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, whether to implement or not implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and whether to unite and educate the majority of cadres. It is a fundamental issue of whether to form a great alliance of revolutionaries, a three-in-one combination of revolution, and whether to seize power and use it well in this unit. To solve this problem, we must take the struggle between the two lines as the key link, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of “striking a large number and protecting a small number” in cadre issues advocated by China's Khrushchev, and pass on Chairman Mao's cadre policy to the broad revolutionary masses. We must conduct a comprehensive class analysis of cadres. Therefore, on the one hand, they organized revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings such as “We must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should we look at a cadre's one-time and one-event, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres.” On the other hand, they seized every opportunity and used every occasion to adopt various forms to propagate Chairman Mao's cadre policy. At the same time, they investigated cadres. Then, in conjunction with the study of relevant editorials on the correct handling of cadre issues from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, they carried out a criticism of China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of “striking a large number and protecting a small number” in cadre issues. This approach effectively eliminated the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line in cadre issues, making the broad revolutionary masses realize that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. The idea of kicking out all cadres who made mistakes is contrary to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, is the result of selfishness, and is poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line, which must be resolutely resisted. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions. We must educate and unite the majority of cadres, enthusiastically help cadres recognize and correct their mistakes, and stand up for the revolution.

Some cadres had many psychological burdens about standing up. The proletarian revolutionaries, targeting various active thoughts of cadres, organized cadres to study the “Three Articles” through heart-to-heart talks and holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducted self-criticism and criticized revisionism to improve their understanding of their own mistakes, correct their attitudes towards the masses, and encourage them to put politics in command and go to the masses. They also pointed out the direction of “three goes”: go to places where the masses have the most complaints and the deepest estrangement to check their mistakes and accept criticism from the masses; go to places where the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line is significant to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line with the masses; go to the most difficult places in production to set an example and lead in production.

Through learning and help, cadres thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and China's Khrushchev's black “Self-Cultivation,” corrected their attitudes towards the masses, correctly recognized their mistakes, and a large number of cadres have stood up for the revolution.

By October of last year, out of the 88 deputy section-level and above cadres in the entire mine, 83 had been released, and 47 of them participated in various levels of leadership work.

“Up” and “Down”

Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the future, cadres should go down to the lower levels to walk around and see, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses.” The new and old cadres at Qing Shan Mine resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, came out of the office, came out of the circle of affairs, and the cadres who made mistakes also came out of the room of “reflection.” They set up the battlefield of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism among the masses, placed the fighting posts on the front line of the revolutionary struggle, and put the center of work at the grassroots level, rooted among the masses, and blended with the masses.

The new and old cadres at Qing Shan Mine followed Chairman Mao's teaching that “We must adhere to the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people,” and went down to participate in labor to reform their worldview.

Adhering to participating in collective production labor has now become a new trend among the cadres at Qing Shan Mine. They formulated a system of working as workers for two days a week. Going down to work did three things the same way: the same as workers entering the shift, participating in the pre-shift meeting, and studying the “Quotations from Chairman Mao”; the same as workers working, taking turns in labor; the same as workers requesting leave for matters, and obeying the dispatch and command of the team leader. Cadres participated in labor completely in the posture of ordinary laborers, going wherever there were difficulties, appearing wherever it was crucial, and setting an example and leading in production.

Chairman Mao said: “We must cultivate the democratic style of listening to the opinions of the masses.” The cadres at Qing Shan Mine, following Chairman Mao's teachings, established a system that is convenient for listening to the opinions of the masses: the leading organs hold an open rectification at least once a month; regularly hold face-to-face meetings with the participation of ordinary cadres and worker masses to give leaders advice; and regularly have the staff of the unit evaluate the performance of cadres in labor and work. This approach has a great educational effect on cadres. Many cadres also often visit the homes of the masses and have individual heart-to-heart talks with the masses, so that the opinions of the masses can be reflected in a timely manner. In this way, cadres feel comfortable, and the masses are also satisfied.

Cadres who made mistakes also, under the help of the leftist support troops and the proletarian revolutionaries, went to the stormy struggle of the masses to temper themselves, went to the masses to conduct self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They listened to the criticism of the masses face to face, checked their mistakes to the masses face to face, and corrected them seriously. Some cadres even actively visited the homes of revolutionaries to seek criticism and help from the masses. The former district chief Lai Lanqi, who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, caused the revolutionaries in the mining area to be persecuted, actively went to the masses in this area to check, and the next day went to work with the workers in the district and participated in labor. The masses gave high praise to the cadres' spirit of self-revolution.

Now, cadres have learned from past lessons, often go down to discover problems, and consult with the masses to solve problems. In this way, cadres are often on the front line, discover problems quickly, and solve problems in a timely manner. Some technical cadres said: “In the past, the focus of business work was on the upper level, now it is on the front line, less effort, greater effect, promoting work, and also having time to participate in labor, which is beneficial for the revolutionization of thought.”

Cadres going down also have an important task: to grasp active thoughts, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and educate themselves and workers. They realized from practice that revolutionary workers love Chairman Mao the most, love Mao Zedong Thought the most, and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most. Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm revolutionary workers, there is no problem that cannot be solved.

Some deceived workers did not understand why they stood on the wrong side. Cadres who made mistakes used personal experience to speak, and together with workers criticized the bourgeois reactionary line. In this way, they educated workers and educated themselves, deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

“Up” or “Down”? This is an extremely profound change in ideology, a struggle of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism in the depths of the soul. The cadres at Qing Shan Mine realized through practice that revolutionary cadres must go to the masses, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, respectfully be the students of the masses, regard themselves as ordinary laborers, ordinary people, and servants of the people. Only in this way can they forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

“Managing” and “Relying”

Cadres going to the masses, going to the front line of revolutionary struggle, the most fundamental problem they encounter is how to correctly treat the masses, whether to “manage” or “rely” on them?

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Many people do not handle the relationship between officers and soldiers, the relationship between the army and the people well, thinking that it is a matter of method. I always tell them that it is a matter of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose). This attitude is to respect soldiers and respect the people.” The cadres at Qing Shan Mine, under the help of the revolutionaries, now realize from practice that whether to “manage” or “rely” on the masses is not a matter of work method, but a matter of standpoint and worldview; it is a dividing line between implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line.

Initially, some cadres, due to being deeply poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line, still wanted to use unreasonable systems to “motivate” the production enthusiasm of the masses. This approach, in essence, is to restore old habits and walk the old road, not to believe in the masses, not to rely on the masses, and only to rely on the system to “control” the masses. In a few days, the masses said: “The old tricks are back, the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been eliminated.”

The cadres at Qing Shan Mine realized that to “rely” on the masses, they must establish a mass standpoint. Under the help of the leftist support troops and the proletarian revolutionaries, they took “self-criticism and criticism of revisionism” as the key link, combined with recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness and criticizing China's Khrushchev's “two relies” (relying on the system and material incentives) and “one does not rely” (not relying on the masses) capitalist management methods, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learned, experienced, summarized experiences and lessons, improved understanding, criticized selfishness, and established red hearts.

The worldview of cadres underwent a new transformation, shifting their foothold to the masses, and thus making cadres firmly walk the mass line, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, overcome the style of commandism, believe in and rely on the masses.

“Relying” on the masses is to rely on the political and ideological awareness of the revolutionary masses, firmly believing that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves. For a period of time, some deceived workers had low attendance rates and work efficiency. Facing this situation, cadres changed their approach of “managing” the masses. On the one hand, they personally went down to the mine to work and insisted on eight hours of work, setting an example for the workers; on the other hand, following Chairman Mao's teachings of believing in and relying on the masses, they mobilized the revolutionary masses to do ideological and political work for the deceived workers, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, propagated the letter from the Central Committee to all coal industry workers across the country, propagated the spirit of the coal industry work meeting of the provincial revolutionary committee, and propagated that coal production is related to the construction of socialism, related to the lives of urban and rural people, and related to the victory of the Cultural Revolution. In this way, the ideological awareness and sense of responsibility as masters of the country of the deceived workers were greatly improved, and the attendance rate and work efficiency were significantly increased.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “In all practical work of our party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses.” The cadres at Qing Shan Mine, under the help of the leftist support troops and the proletarian revolutionaries, realized that to “rely” on the masses, they must learn the working method of “coming from the masses and going to the masses” of the mass line. Every time they make plans, formulate measures, and draft schemes, they first go to the masses to seek opinions, then concentrate them, and then take them to the masses to turn them into the actions of the masses.

“The people have limitless creativity.” Countless facts made the cadres at Qing Shan Mine deeply realize that relying on the masses, everything is easy to do, the revolution is good, and production goes up; separating from the masses, every step is difficult. They established a fundamental system of relying closely on the masses, consulting with the masses on everything, and walking the mass line.

    青山煤矿执行毛主席关于干部问题最新指示的体会
    萍乡矿务局临时领导小组、萍乡矿革命造反派联合司令部
    江西萍乡矿务局青山矿无产阶级革命派和革命干部在人民解放军驻矿支左部队热情帮助下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，用毛泽东思想建立了崭新的干群关系。干部群众团结一心，革命生产热气腾腾。
      “踢”和“帮”
    青山矿在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，由于党内一小撮走资派的挑动和蒙蔽，很多干部站错了队，干群之间对立情绪很严重。对于这些犯了错误的干部，是热情帮助还是一脚踢开？
    毛主席教导我们：对待犯错误的同志，究竟是采取敌视态度还是采取帮助态度，这是区别一个人是好心还是坏心的一个标准。青山矿无产阶级革命派体会到：对犯错误干部是“踢”还是“帮”，这是两条路线的斗争，是执行不执行毛主席的干部政策，执行不执行毛主席的革命路线，能不能团结、教育大多数干部的根本问题，是搞好革命大联合、革命三结合、本单位斗批改以及掌好权、用好权的关键问题。要解决好这个问题，必须以两条路线斗争为纲，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把毛主席的干部政策交给广大革命群众，对干部进行全面的阶级分析。于是，他们一方面组织革命群众认真学习毛主席关于“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法”等教导；一方面抓紧一切机会，利用一切场合，采取多种形式，宣传毛主席的干部政策；同时对干部进行调查。然后，结合学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》有关正确对待干部问题的社论，开展对中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的批判。这样做的结果，有力地肃清了资产阶级反动路线在干部问题上的流毒，使广大革命群众认识到：干部大多数是好的和比较好的。把犯错误的干部统统踢开的思想，违背毛主席的革命路线，是“私”字作怪，是中了资产阶级反动路线的毒，要坚决抵制。我们要无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，对毛主席的指示就是要坚决照办。一定要教育、团结干部的大多数，热情帮助干部认识错误，改正错误，站出来革命。
    有的干部对自己站出来有不少思想包袱。无产阶级革命派就针对干部的各种活思想，通过谈心和举办毛泽东思想学习班等方法，组织干部学习“老三篇”，进行斗私批修，提高对自己错误的认识，端正对群众的态度，鼓励他们政治挂帅，到群众中去。还给他们指出了“三去”的方向：到群众意见最多和隔阂最深的地方去，检查自己的错误，接受群众批评；到执行资产阶级反动路线影响较大的地方去，同群众一起批判资产阶级反动路线；到生产第一线最困难的地方去，在生产中起模范带头作用。
    通过学习和帮助，干部狠批了资产阶级反动路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》，端正了对群众的态度，正确地认识了自己的错误，大批干部已站出来革命。
    到去年十月份，全矿八十八名副科级以上干部，已有八十三名先后解放出来，其中有四十七名还参加了各级领导工作。
          “上”和“下”
    毛主席教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”青山矿的新老干部坚决照毛主席的指示办事，从办公室里走出来，从事务圈子里钻出来，犯错误的干部也从“闭门思过”的房子里解放出来，把斗私批修的战场摆在群众中，把战斗的岗位放在革命斗争的第一线，把工作重心放在基层，到群众中扎根，同群众打成一片。
    青山矿的新老干部遵循毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷”的教导，下去首先就是参加劳动，改造世界观。
    坚持参加集体生产劳动，现在已成为青山矿干部的新风气。他们制订了每周当两天工人的制度。下去劳动做到了“三个一样”：同工人一样进班，参加班前会，学习《毛主席语录》；同工人一样干活，顶班劳动；同工人一样有事请假，服从班组长的调度指挥。干部参加劳动完全以普通劳动者的姿态出现，哪里有困难，就到哪里去，哪里是关键，就在哪里出现，在生产中起模范带头作用。
    毛主席说：“必须养成善于听取群众意见的民主作风”。青山矿的干部，遵照毛主席的教导，建立了便于听取群众意见的制度：领导机关每月至少进行一次开门整风；定期召开有一般干部、工人群众参加的面对面给领导干部提意见的座谈会；对干部参加劳动和工作的表现，定期由本单位职工群众讲评一次。这样做，对干部教育很大。许多干部还经常登门访问群众，找群众个别谈心，让群众的意见及时反映上来。这样，干部心情舒畅，群众也满意。
    犯错误的干部也在支左部队和无产阶级革命派的帮助下，到群众斗争的大风雨中去经受锻炼，到群众中去斗私批修。他们当面听取群众的批评意见，当面向群众检查自己的错误，并且认真改正。有的干部还主动到革命派家里去谈心，争取群众的批评帮助。原区长赖兰启执行资产阶级反动路线，使回采一区的革命派遭到迫害，赖兰启就主动到这个区的群众中去检查，第二天又跟区里的职工一道上班，参加劳动。群众对干部这种自我革命的精神，给了高度的评价。
    现在干部吸取了过去的教训，经常下去发现问题，同群众商量解决问题。这样，干部经常身在第一线，发现问题快，解决问题就及时。有的技术干部说：“过去业务工作重点在上面，现在放到第一线，费劲小，效果大，促进了工作，又有时间参加劳动，有利于思想革命化。”
    干部下去，还有一个重要任务：抓活思想，宣传毛泽东思想，教育自己又教育工人。他们从实践中体会到：革命工人最热爱毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想，最理解毛主席的革命路线。用毛泽东思想去武装革命工人就没有解决不了的问题。
    有的受蒙蔽工人对自己站错队不理解，犯错误干部就现身说法，和工人一道批判资产阶级反动路线，这样，既教育了工人又教育了自己，加深了对毛主席革命路线的理解。
      “上”还是“下”？这是一场极其深刻的思想变革，是一场灵魂深处斗私批修的战斗。青山矿的干部通过实践认识到：革命干部必须到群众中去，坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，恭恭敬敬做群众的小学生，把自己当作一个普普通通的劳动者，小小的老百姓，人民的勤务员。这样，才能永葆革命青春。
          “管”和“靠”
    干部到群众中去，到革命斗争的第一线去，遇到的最根本问题就是如何正确对待群众，对群众是“管”还是“靠”？
    毛主席教导我们：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。”青山矿的干部在革命派的帮助下，现在从实践中体会到：对群众是“管”还是“靠”？这不是工作方法问题，而是立场和世界观的问题；这是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，还是执行资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。
    开初，有的干部由于受资产阶级反动路线的毒害较深，仍想用不合理的制度来“调动”群众的生产积极性。这样做，实质是复旧习，走老路，不相信群众，不依靠群众，光靠制度“卡”群众。不到几天，群众就说：“老一套又来了，资产阶级反动路线的流毒还没有肃清。”
    青山矿的干部认识到：要“靠”群众，必须树立群众观点。他们在支左部队和无产阶级革命派的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，结合忆苦思甜和对中国赫鲁晓夫“两靠”（靠制度，靠物质刺激）、“一不靠”
  （不靠群众）的资本主义管理企业方法的批判，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，边学习，边体会，边总结经验教训，边提高认识，斗私心，立红心。
    干部的世界观来了一个新的转变，把立足点移到群众方面来，从而使干部坚定地走群众路线，尊重群众的首创精神，克服命令主义的作风，相信和依靠群众。
      “靠”群众，是靠革命群众的政治思想觉悟，坚定相信群众完全可以自己教育自己，自己解放自己。有一段时间，有的受蒙蔽的工人出勤率和工效不高。针对这种情况，干部改变了“管”群众的作法，一方面亲自下井劳动，坚持八小时工作，给工人做出样子；另一方面遵循毛主席关于相信和依靠群众的教导，广泛发动革命群众做受蒙蔽工人的思想政治工作，宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传中央给全国煤炭工业战线职工的信，宣传省革筹小组煤炭工作会议的精神，宣传煤炭生产关系到社会主义建设，关系到城乡人民生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，从而提高了受蒙蔽工人的思想觉悟和国家主人翁的高度责任感，劳动出勤率和工效大大提高。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”青山矿干部，在支左部队和无产阶级革命派的帮助下，认识到：要“靠”群众，就必须学会“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法。他们每次做计划，订措施，搞方案，都先到群众中去征求意见，然后集中起来，再拿到群众中去，变为群众的行动。
      “人民群众有无限的创造力。”无数事实使青山矿的干部深深体会到：依靠群众，事事好办，革命搞得好，生产上得去；脱离群众，寸步难行。他们把紧紧依靠群众，遇事走群众路线，多和群众商量，作为一条根本制度订了下来。
