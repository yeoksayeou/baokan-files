The revolutionary people of Yemen, in their struggle against the subversion plots of U.S. imperialism, deeply feel that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is their powerful ideological weapon to defeat the enemy. They express their determination to follow the teachings of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, to use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, launch armed self-defense struggles, foil subversion plots, and defend national independence.

Two Yemeni friends recently asked Chinese friends for Chairman Mao's works, saying: "We often study Chairman Mao's great teachings. Sometimes we get a book by Chairman Mao, and we pass it around among ourselves, taking turns to read it. After reading, we discuss it collectively and draw boundless spiritual strength from it. Especially now, in our struggle against the armed intervention of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia, we particularly need Mao Zedong Thought." They emphasized: "Chairman Mao is the great commander of the world's revolutionary people, the red sun in our hearts. It is the great Chairman Mao who leads the world's people in the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light for revolution. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, launch armed struggles, and with people's war, foil the plots of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, and foil the surrender plots advocated by Soviet revisionism to negotiate with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries." They angrily pointed out: "The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and become an accomplice of U.S. imperialism."

Another Yemeni friend told a Chinese friend: "Currently, U.S. imperialism is instigating the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia, together with mercenaries, to try to strangle the Yemeni republican regime, but their plots will definitely not succeed. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no formidable power.' As long as we persist in people's war, any powerful enemy will be defeated by us, and ultimately, victory will be ours." A member of the people's self-defense forces said: "After reading Chairman Mao's quotations, my mind became as bright as seeing the sun, immediately opening up, and I was filled with strength and confidence. I will use Mao Zedong Thought as my weapon to defend the republican regime and the revolution, and strike down all invading enemies."

Many Yemeni friends, on New Year's Day, while congratulating Chinese friends on the new year, said: "Let us together wish the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life!"

    开展武装自卫斗争  粉碎美帝颠覆阴谋
    也门革命人民决心遵循毛主席教导打击来犯敌人保卫民族独立
    新华社萨那五日电　也门革命人民在抗击美帝国主义颠覆阴谋的斗争中，深深地体会到战无不胜的毛泽东思想是他们战胜敌人的强大思想武器。他们表示决心遵循世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的教导，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，开展武装自卫斗争，粉碎颠覆阴谋，保卫民族独立。
    两位也门朋友最近向中国朋友索取毛主席著作时说：“我们经常学习毛主席的伟大教导。有时我们得到一本毛主席的书，你传我，我传他，轮流传阅。读完后再集体讨论，从中汲取无穷的精神力量。特别在目前，我们在进行一场反对美帝国主义—沙特阿拉伯反动势力的武装干涉的战斗中，尤其需要毛泽东思想。”他们强调说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大统帅，是我们心中的红太阳。正是伟大的毛主席领导着世界人民进行世界革命。毛泽东思想是我们进行革命的指路明灯。我们要遵照毛主席的教导，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，开展武装斗争，用人民战争粉碎美帝国主义及一切反动派的阴谋活动，粉碎苏联修正主义所鼓吹的与美帝国主义和反动派进行和谈的投降阴谋。”他们愤怒指出：“苏修领导集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，成了美帝国主义的帮凶。”
    另一位也门朋友对中国朋友说：“目前，美帝国主义唆使沙特阿拉伯反动势力，伙同雇佣军妄图扼杀也门共和政权，但是，他们的阴谋一定不会得逞。正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：‘一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。’只要我们坚持人民战争，任何强大的敌人都会被我们打败，最后胜利一定属于我们。”一位人民自卫队队员说：“我读了毛主席的语录后，我的思想就象见到了太阳一样，立即开阔起来，浑身充满了力量和信心。我要用毛泽东思想做武器，捍卫共和政权和革命，打击一切来犯的敌人。”
    许多也门朋友元旦那天在向中国朋友祝贺新年时说：“让我们共同敬祝全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
