The dawn of the small island is filled with laughter; the dawn of the small island is bathed in sunlight. "The situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is excellent," a broadcast announces, and the waves of the sea leap with joy. Hurry and open the newspaper to see, hurry and unfold the map to find, the vast lands of the motherland are blooming with spring's charm everywhere. Our "East is Red" radio is busy, with how many pieces of good news from spring to report to the island soldiers! The good news of the educational revolution in the capital, the joyous reports of seizing the revolution and promoting production on the banks of the Huangpu River, the new experiences from the Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the Qinghai Plateau, the new wave of supporting the army and loving the people on the banks of the Gan River... We stand on the island and look towards the Central Plains: we see it, Chairman Mao has traversed the south and north of the Yangtze River; we stand on the island and look towards Beijing: we see it, Chairman Mao is waving to us and smiling. In the past, Chairman Mao led us to cross mountains and rivers, writing the magnificent epic across countless mountains and passes; today, Chairman Mao leads us to hack through thorns and brambles, racing forward on the bright path to communism! Every directive from Chairman Mao makes our direction clear and our spirits high; every word from Chairman Mao is like the spring wind and rain nurturing the sprouts! Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is like the red sun illuminating the hearts of hundreds of millions of people; the victorious battle song of Mao Zedong Thought is higher and higher! We are Chairman Mao's loyal soldiers, delighted to see the favorable situation, and we carve our battle oaths on the island: to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, fearing not the collapse of the heavens and the earth, the raging winds, and the roaring seas... The dawn of the small island is bathed in sunlight, and the hearts of the soldiers are surging with passion. "The situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is excellent," Chairman Mao's voice echoes through the sky!

    喜看大好形势
    解放军某部战士　栾纪曾小岛的黎明，一片欢笑；黎明的小岛，阳光普照。“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大
  好”，一声广播，乐得满海浪花飞跳。快翻开报纸看呵，快打开地图找，祖国的万里江山处处是春色妖娆。忙坏了咱们的“东方红”收音机，有多少春天的喜讯要向海岛战士报！祖国首都教育革命的好消息，黄浦江畔抓革命促生产的喜报，青海高原毛泽东思想学习班的新经验，赣江边拥军爱民又掀起新高潮……我们站在小岛望中原：看见了呀，毛主席走遍了大江南北；我们站在小岛望北京：看见了呀，毛主席向我们挥手笑。过去，毛主席率领我们跋山涉水，把壮丽的史诗写遍重重关山；今天，毛主席率领我们披荆斩棘，全速奔驰在共产主义的光明大道！毛主席的每一个指示，都使我们方向明确干劲高；毛主席的每一句话，都是那春风春雨催春苗！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，象红太阳照亮了亿万人民的心；毛泽东思想战无不胜的凯歌，一曲更比一曲高！我们是毛主席的忠诚战士，喜看大好形势，把战斗誓言刻在海岛：保卫毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，不怕天崩地裂风狂海啸。……黎明的小岛，阳光普照，战士的心里，激情如潮。“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大
  好”，毛主席的声音响彻云霄！
