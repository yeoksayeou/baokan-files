	Mao Zedong Thought Guides World People in Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Struggle
	The Cultural Revolution Makes China, the Center of World Revolution, Even Stronger
	The Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau Calls on Afro-Asian Writers to Create More Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Works to Serve the People's Struggle

	New China News Agency, January 16th - The Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau issued a statement on the 15th, the full text of which is as follows:

	Recently, the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau has held close and friendly consultations with revolutionary and progressive writers from many Afro-Asian countries on the successful convening of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference and the activities to be completed before the "Three Conferences."

	During the consultations, it was reaffirmed that the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement is dedicated to promoting the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and to achieving and safeguarding national independence, people's democracy, and socialism.

	Everyone agreed that if Afro-Asian writers use the Mao Zedong Thought expressed in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to guide themselves, they can better serve the people based on the current world political situation, especially the political situation in Afro-Asia.

	Today, imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse, and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Different political forces are in a state of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. A new historical era has arrived in which Mao Zedong Thought has become the most revolutionary guiding ideology for the world's people in their struggles against imperialism, colonialism, reactionaries, and revisionism, and in their struggles to achieve and safeguard national independence, people's democracy, and socialism.

	The world situation is indeed excellent! In the heart of the world revolutionary storm—Asia, Africa, and Latin America—the people's revolutionary movements are thriving. The revolutionary struggles in Afro-Asia and Latin America are delivering decisive and fatal blows to the old world led by U.S. imperialism.

	In these regions, which represent the world's rural areas, the revolutionary people are establishing, consolidating, and expanding their revolutionary forces, surrounding the world's cities—North America and Europe.

	In Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam, the people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its puppets has reached new heights. The heroic Vietnamese people are achieving one victory after another, proving that despite the strength of U.S. imperialism, it is merely a paper tiger. In this region, which has become the focal point of the world's revolutionary and counter-revolutionary struggles, many people have taken up arms to defeat their common enemy and achieve liberation. The people in this region have achieved brilliant victories.

	The U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, invaded Arab countries, educating the Arab people to better distinguish between friends and enemies. This war once again exposed the traitorous face of Soviet modern revisionism. The national liberation movements in these regions are advancing. The Palestinian people have made greater resolve to liberate their sacred homeland through people's war.

	In Africa, many peoples have taken to armed struggle, delivering blow after blow to imperialism, colonialism, and their lackeys, as well as to reactionary and racist minority white regimes.

	The peoples of independent African countries have realized the great tasks before them: to resist the infiltration of imperialism and old and new colonialism, including cultural infiltration, and to continue advancing along the path of national democratic revolution.

	In Latin America, the "backyard" of U.S. imperialism, the people's revolutionary struggles are deepening and growing. In various regions, the people's struggles have successfully developed into armed struggles.

	In the United States, African Americans have adopted revolutionary violence to achieve liberation, sparking a massive storm against racism and reactionary rule. The people's movement against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam is deeply and widely developing, causing continuous panic, chaos, and internal contradictions within the U.S. imperialist's own forces.

	The deepening economic crisis in imperialist and capitalist countries has led to currency devaluation and the transfer of corresponding economic burdens to the already suffering masses, sharpening class struggles and accelerating the collapse of the capitalist system.

	The thriving world revolutionary movement is inseparable from today's most significant and historically meaningful event—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has spread Mao Zedong Thought widely around the world, raising the political awareness of the world's people to a new and higher level, helping the world's people distinguish between revolution and counter-revolution, enemies and friends, and Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, and equipping the world's people with the sharpest weapon to fight imperialism.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made China, the center of world revolution, even stronger, preventing the restoration of capitalism, thereby consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensuring that the world revolution will continue to have a strong base as its pillar. With the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China will not change color.

	The countercurrents stirred up by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices will never be able to stop the main trend of the world people's revolutionary movement.

	The Soviet revisionists have degenerated into counter-revolutionaries, engaging in despicable activities to split revolutionary and progressive movements, thereby aiding the imperialists and becoming an inseparable part of the countercurrent led by U.S. imperialism. In the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement, they have already and are continuing to split our ranks, sabotaging our writers' struggle with the peoples of Afro-Asia and the world against our common enemy.

	Under this situation, we believe that our responsibility is: to work together with all revolutionary, progressive, and patriotic writers and artists to build a strong united front of cultural workers against imperialism and its accomplices and old and new colonialism.

	Our colleagues have made many valuable suggestions to the Bureau. The Bureau will do its utmost to cooperate fully with revolutionary and progressive writers from various Afro-Asian countries to implement suggestions that are beneficial to our common cause and will pave the way for the successful convening of the "Three Conferences."

	Based on these suggestions, the Bureau calls on Afro-Asian writers to fully combine their work with the struggles of the peoples of various countries, promote Afro-Asian anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, revolutionary, popular, and national new culture and new literature and art, create more revolutionary literary and artistic works to serve the people's struggles; and organize local and regional activities in this direction, strengthen and expand their organizations, and ensure the success of the "Three Conferences."

    毛泽东思想指导世界人民进行反帝反修斗争
    文化大革命使世界革命中心的中国更加强大
    亚非作家常设局号召亚非作家创造更多的革命文艺作品为人民斗争服务
    新华社十六日讯　亚非作家常设局十五日发表声明，全文如下：
    最近，亚非作家常设局同许多亚非国家的革命和进步作家，就成功地召开第三届亚非作家大会和“三大”以前要完成的活动等问题，进行了亲密友好的协商。
    协商中重申：亚非作家运动是致力于促进亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义以及争取和维护民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的一个运动。
    大家一致认为，在促进这一事业中，如果亚非作家用《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中所表达的毛泽东思想来指导自己，他们就可以根据当前世界政治形势、特别是亚非政治形势更好地为人民服务。
    今天世界上，帝国主义正走向全面崩溃，社会主义正走向全世界的胜利。不同的政治力量正处于大动荡、大分化和大改组的过程中。毛泽东思想成为指导世界人民进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义、反动派和修正主义及争取和维护民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的斗争的最革命思想的崭新的历史时代已经到来。
    世界的形势确实大好！在世界革命风暴的中心亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展。亚非拉的革命斗争正给予以美帝国主义为首的旧世界以决定性和致命的打击。
    在代表着世界农村的这些地区，革命的人民正在建立、巩固和扩大他们的革命力量，包围世界的城市——北美和欧洲。
    在东南亚，特别是在越南，人民反对美帝国主义及其傀儡的斗争达到了新的高度。英雄的越南人民正在取得一个又一个的胜利，证明了尽管美帝国主义有力量，却只不过是一只纸老虎。在这个已经成为世界上革命和反革命斗争焦点的地区，许多人都拿起了武器来战胜他们共同的敌人，赢得解放。这个地区的人民已经取得了辉煌的胜利。
    美帝国主义的工具以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的战争，教育了阿拉伯人民更清楚地区分敌友。这次战争，再一次暴露了苏联现代修正主义的叛徒面目。这些地区的民族解放运动正在向前发展。巴勒斯坦人民下定了更大的决心，通过人民战争来解放他们神圣的家园。
    在非洲，许多人民已经走上了武装斗争的道路，给予了帝国主义、殖民主义和他们的走狗以及反动和种族主义的少数白人专政一次又一次的打击。
    非洲独立国家的人民已经觉察到他们所面临的伟大任务：反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义渗透的痕迹，包括文化渗透在内，并且正沿着民族民主革命的道路继续前进。
    在美帝国主义的“后院”拉丁美洲，人民的革命斗争正在深入、壮大。在各个地区，人民的斗争已经胜利地发展为武装斗争。
    在美国，美国黑人采用了革命的暴力来赢得解放，掀起了反对种族主义和反动统治的巨大风暴。人民反对美帝国主义侵略越南的运动正在深入广泛地发展，使美帝国主义本身的力量内部不断地发生恐慌、混乱和内部矛盾。
    帝国主义和资本主义国家经济危机的加深引起了他们的货币贬值，并使相应的经济负担转嫁到早已在受苦难的人民群众的身上。这就使这些国家的阶级斗争尖锐化和加速了资本主义制度的崩溃。
    世界革命运动的蓬勃发展同今天世界上最重大和最有历史意义的事件——中国无产阶级文化大革命是分不开的。中国无产阶级文化大革命使毛泽东思想在全世界得到了广泛的传播，把世界人民的政治认识水平提高到了一个新的更高的水平，帮助世界人民区分革命和反革命，敌人和朋友以及马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义，使世界人民掌握了反对帝国主义的最锐利的武器。
    无产阶级文化大革命使得世界革命中心的中国更为强大了，避免了资本主义的复辟，因此巩固了无产阶级专政和确保了世界革命将继续有一个强大的根据地作为它的支柱。有了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，中国将不会改变颜色。
    美帝国主义及其帮凶所掀起的逆流永远阻挡不了世界人民革命运动的主流。
    苏联修正主义者已堕落成反革命，他们从事于分裂革命和进步运动的卑鄙活动，从而帮助了帝国主义者并正在变为以美帝国主义为首的逆流的不可分割的一部分。在亚非作家运动中，他们已经并且正在分裂我们的阵营，破坏我们作家与亚非及全世界人民一道反对共同敌人的斗争。
    在这个形势下，我们认为，我们的责任是：同所有革命进步的和爱国的作家、艺术家一起，努力工作，建立起强大的文化工作者的反对帝国主义及其帮凶和新老殖民主义的统一战线。
    同行们向常设局提出了很多宝贵的建议。常设局将尽最大的努力，同亚非各国革命和进步作家全力合作，履行有益于我们共同事业的、并将为“三大”的胜利召开铺平道路的建议。
    根据这些建议，常设局号召亚非作家与各国人民的斗争完全结合起来，促进亚非反帝反殖的、革命的、人民大众的和民族的新文化，新文艺，创造出更多的革命文艺作品，为人民的斗争服务；并依照这个方向组织当地的和区域性的活动，加强和扩大他们的组织，确保“三大”的成功。
