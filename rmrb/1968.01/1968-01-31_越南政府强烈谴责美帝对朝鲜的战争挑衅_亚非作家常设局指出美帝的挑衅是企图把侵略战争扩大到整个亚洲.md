Vietnamese Government Strongly Condemns U.S. Imperialist War Provocations Against Korea

The Asian-African Writers' Bureau Points Out that U.S. Provocations Aim to Expand Aggressive War to the Entire Asia

	HA NOI, Jan. 29 (New China News Agency) -- The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 29 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists for dispatching the spy ship "Pueblo" into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in provocative activities.

	The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the correct stand taken by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its statement of January 27, 1968, and regards the capture of the 'Pueblo' ship by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a legitimate exercise of the sacred and inalienable right of self-defense of the Government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demands that the U.S. Government immediately stop all provocative actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

	The statement said: "The dispatch of the spy ship 'Pueblo' by the U.S. imperialists into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a violation of international law and the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement. It is a threat to peace in Asia and the world and a brazen provocation to the peace-loving and justice-loving peoples of the world."

	The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests against the U.S. Government's attempt to bring the so-called 'Pueblo incident' before the United Nations Security Council for discussion. The U.S. imperialists, under the banner of the United Nations, have suffered a shameful defeat in their aggressive war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Now they are suffering defeats in both South and North Vietnam. If they persist in their aggressive actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the heroic Korean army and people will surely give them the punishment they deserve."

	HA NOI, Jan. 30 (New China News Agency) -- The Asian-African Writers' Bureau issued a statement on January 29 supporting the just stand taken by the Government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in opposing the serious provocations of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement said that the capture of the spy ship "Pueblo" by the Korean people in self-defense against the criminal aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism is a correct action. The "Pueblo" spy ship's intrusion into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not accidental. The U.S. aggressors, facing certain defeat on the Vietnam battlefield, are plotting to expand their aggressive war to the whole of Asia. The provocative action against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an important part of the U.S. imperialists' evil plan.

	The statement said that the U.S. imperialists are now using the capture of the "Pueblo" spy ship to intensify war mobilization and war blackmail to intimidate the Korean people. The Johnson administration has dispatched U.S. military aircraft from Japan and Okinawa to South Korea and has sent a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the "Enterprise," to the waters off Korea. The statement said that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to intimidate the Korean people again, apparently forgetting the lesson they received from the Korean people in the last Korean War.

	The statement called on all progressive and revolutionary Asian and African writers to resolutely support the writers and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and to thoroughly and completely smash the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    越南政府强烈谴责美帝对朝鲜的战争挑衅
    亚非作家常设局指出美帝的挑衅是企图把侵略战争扩大到整个亚洲
    新华社河内二十九日电　越南民主共和国政府二十九日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣间谍船“普韦布洛号”进入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海进行挑衅活动。
    声明说：“越南民主共和国政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九六八年一月二十七日的声明中所阐述的正确立场，并认为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府俘获‘普韦布洛号’船是符合朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民的神圣不可侵犯的和不可剥夺的自卫权利的。越南民主共和国政府坚决要求美国政府立即停止对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一切挑衅行动。”
    声明说：“美帝国主义者派遣间谍船‘普韦布洛号’进入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海，违反了国际法和一九五三年朝鲜停战协定，是对亚洲和世界和平的威胁，也是对世界上爱好和平和主持正义的人民的蛮横挑衅。”
    声明说：“越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议美国把所谓的‘普韦布洛号事件’提交联合国安全理事会讨论。美帝国主义者打着联合国的旗号对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的侵略战争已经遭到了可耻的失败，现在他们在越南南北两方正在遭到惨败。如果他们顽固地和肆无忌惮地侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，那末，英雄的朝鲜军队和人民必将给予他们以应得的惩罚性的打击。”
    新华社三十日讯　亚非作家常设局二十九日就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国俘获美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”事件发表声明，坚决支持朝鲜政府和人民为反对美帝国主义的严重挑衅而采取的正义立场。
    声明说，朝鲜人民为反对美帝国主义的犯罪的侵略行为，采取了自卫的正确行动，俘获了这艘间谍船。“普韦布洛号”间谍船侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海进行活动，决不是偶然的。美国侵略者面对着在越南战场上注定失败的命运，正在阴谋把侵略战争扩大到整个亚洲。对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取的这一挑衅活动，是美帝国主义这一罪恶计划的一个重要组成部分。
    声明说，美帝国主义现在正在利用间谍船“普韦布洛号”被俘获一事，大力进行战争动员和战争讹诈来恐吓朝鲜人民。约翰逊政府已经从日本和冲绳调派美国的军用飞机进驻南朝鲜，并把美国的一艘核动力航空母舰“企业号”调往朝鲜海面。声明说，美帝国主义企图再次对朝鲜人民进行恐吓，看来他们是忘记了在上次朝鲜战争中朝鲜人民对他们的教训。
    声明号召所有进步和革命的亚非作家，坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的作家和人民，坚决、彻底和全面地粉碎美帝国主义侵略者。
