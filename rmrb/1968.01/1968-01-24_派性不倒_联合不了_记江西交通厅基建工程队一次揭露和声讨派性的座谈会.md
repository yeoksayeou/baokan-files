A new wave is sweeping through Nanchang City to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sectarianism and achieve revolutionary great unity. In this wave, the revolutionary masses of the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department Construction Engineering Team have united. Over 200 employees of this unit had previously joined the "Jinggangshan" Corps and the "Hard to the End," "Unbeatable" factions, opposing each other for a long time and suffering from sectarianism. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, after studying the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, Liberation Army Daily, and the Wenhui Bao editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Sectarianism," they awakened from the deception of sectarianism. Recently, the members of the revolutionary great unity committee of this unit held a meeting to expose the crimes and harm of sectarianism and launched an offensive against sectarianism.

Sectarianism has set up numerous obstacles to revolutionary great unity.

When the meeting began, a comrade from the original "Jinggangshan" Corps spoke: Our unit has not been able to achieve revolutionary great unity for a long time, all because of sectarianism. In September last year, Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on revolutionary great unity. At that time, we thought: Our faction is in power and has more people, whether we unite or not, it doesn't matter. But then we thought, Chairman Mao has issued instructions, we must show a "high posture," so at the end of September, we first proposed the initiative for revolutionary great unity. In fact, this was to gain some political "advantage," with the aim of swallowing the other side. Unexpectedly, the other side responded, and we had to sit down and talk. How could we reach an agreement! Talk about unity in the meeting, but cause friction after the meeting, talk about unity during the day, but work against the other side at night. After talking several times, the more we talked, the more stalemated it became, and the greater the contradictions. In mid-October, both sides signed an agreement to discuss great unity within the unit, but it still didn't work out. In mid-December, we talked again, but since sectarianism has not been overturned, unity is not possible, and the negotiations have not been successful.

The power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless. Once sectarianism encounters the great Mao Zedong Thought, it is exposed and has nowhere to hide. In late December last year, the leaders of both factions participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, seriously studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, sincerely exposing their private thoughts, fighting sectarianism, and touching the soul. We realized that in the past, due to sectarianism, class brothers did not recognize each other, struggle, criticism, and reform were not carried out well, and it also affected production and work. We decided to act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In early January this year, we achieved revolutionary great unity.

Sectarianism makes people see class brothers as thorns in their eyes.

As soon as the comrade from "Jinggangshan" finished speaking, a comrade from the original "Hard to the End" faction followed: The comrades from "Jinggangshan" criticized themselves, saying that they had no sincerity in talking about revolutionary great unity; similarly, we "Hard to the End" were also entangled by sectarianism, and even dug up the other side's foundations! Chairman Mao said: "We must distinguish between friends and enemies and cannot stand on the enemy's side and treat comrades with the attitude of treating enemies." But we violated Chairman Mao's instruction. We learned that the other side was doing "work" in our organization to "disintegrate" our people, so we also prepared to disintegrate the other side and dig up their foundations. I secretly talked to more than ten people in the other organization, inciting them to leave their original organization and join ours. Sectarianism is really harmful, once infected by sectarianism, you will see class brothers as thorns in your eyes and try every evil trick to destroy the brother organization. Destroying the brother organization benefits whom? It's just the class enemy who is happy, causing the revolutionary cause to suffer losses. In the future, we will not fall for sectarianism again!

Sectarianism makes us unable to correctly handle cadres.

Next, another comrade from the original "Jinggangshan" spoke, exposing the evil consequences of sectarianism in implementing the cadre policy. He said, our materials director, in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line for a short period. Later, the masses criticized his mistakes, and he also checked himself several times, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and actively aligning with the revolutionary faction. At that time, we thought he was a relatively good cadre, often talked to him, sometimes invited him to participate in meetings, and for a while, we even planned to absorb him into the temporary leadership group. But soon, our attitude towards him changed, because this cadre later joined our opposing organization. Originally, cadres who come out should be allowed to join any revolutionary mass organization. But we, starting from sectarianism, could not tolerate him joining the other organization, so we used the excuse of continuing to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and named him as the first to criticize; while for cadres who implemented the reactionary line more seriously, we did not pay attention to them. That day, the other organization was holding a meeting, and we insisted on bringing him out to criticize and struggle. The other side did not let go, and both sides argued fiercely. The next day, we severely criticized this cadre, and then found an excuse to let him step aside.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue were issued, we considered the situation of the cadres and felt that this materials director was generally a good cadre and should be liberated. But then we thought, liberating cadres from the other organization, no; if you want to come out, you must join our organization. Sectarianism is indeed a reactionary thing. We used sectarianism to treat cadres, even ignoring Chairman Mao's instructions and disregarding the party's policy.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Correctly handling cadres is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit. This problem must be solved well." We were confused by sectarianism and did not correctly handle cadres. Cadres who wanted to come out could not come out; cadres who should have come out earlier did not come out for a long time, causing certain losses to the revolution and production. Now, we have liberated this materials director according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. However, the lesson of the outbreak of sectarianism in this matter needs to be seriously remembered, and it must not be allowed to cause trouble again! Sectarianism clouds the mind, confusing friends and enemies.

On October 11 last year, the construction team issued a leaflet, printed by "Hard to the End" and "Unbeatable." The leaflet begins: "Highest directive: To create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

This passage of Chairman Mao's quotations was originally directed at the class enemy, but it was used in the leaflet "Open Letter to the Soldiers of the Jinggangshan Corps."

At that time, both sides were in a state of intense sectarianism, arguing fiercely. "Hard to the End" and "Unbeatable," in order to strike at the "Jinggangshan" Corps and disintegrate the other side, wrote this leaflet. The leaflet called some of the other side's leaders a "bunch" and told the "Jinggangshan" soldiers to "open their eyes and distinguish between friends and enemies." Of course, such a leaflet could not have a good effect; it could only make the hostility between the two sides more severe.

Now, the former leaders of both organizations, sitting together to denounce sectarianism, each exposed how their organization took a utilitarian attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions in the past and used Chairman Mao's quotations to serve their own sectarianism. This leaflet is one example. They felt deeply ashamed and regretful about their past wrongdoings. They said that once bitten by the snake of sectarianism, one might treat enemies as friends and friends as enemies, doing things that hurt friends and please enemies.

This denunciation meeting against sectarianism was held in a heated atmosphere. Fighting sectarianism, everyone's spirit grew stronger, and they became more intimate with each other, feeling more and more that Chairman Mao's instructions were brilliant and great. At the end of the meeting, everyone said that although this meeting has ended, the struggle against sectarianism has not ended. Sectarianism is a stubborn enemy, its root is "self." We must continue to fight, fight frequently, and thoroughly expose the private and sectarian nature. Everyone expressed that they would definitely do a good job in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, seriously fight against self and criticize revisionism, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    加强无产阶级党性，增强阶级斗争观念
    派性不倒　联合不了
    ——记江西交通厅基建工程队一次揭露和声讨派性的座谈会
    南昌市正在掀起一个打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，实现革命大联合的新高潮。在这个高潮中，江西交通厅基建工程队的革命群众组织联合起来了。这个单位的两百多名职工，曾经分别参加了“井冈山”兵团和“硬到底”、“压不倒”两派革命群众组织，长期对立，吃尽派性之苦。在毛主席的最新指示感召下，他们深入学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论和《文汇报》社论《论派性的反动性》以后，从派性的蒙蔽中清醒过来。最近，这个单位革命大联合委员会的委员，举行了座谈会，历数派性的罪状和危害，打了一场围剿派性的进攻战。
      派性给革命大联合设下重重障碍
    座谈会开始，原“井冈山”兵团的同志发言说：我们单位过去迟迟不能实现革命大联合，就是派性作怪。去年九月间，毛主席发出了革命大联合的最新指示，当时我们想：我们这派掌了权，人又多，联合不联合，没有关系。可是又一想，毛主席有了指示，我们要摆出一个“高姿态”才行，就在九月底首先提出了革命大联合的倡议。其实，这是想搞点政治“优势”，目的是为了吃掉对方。不料对方却响应了，只好坐下来谈。哪能谈得拢！会上谈联合，会后闹磨擦，白天谈联合，晚上却搞对方。谈了几次，越谈越僵，矛盾越来越大。十月中旬，双方订了协议，回本单位谈大联合，还是没有谈起来。十二月中旬又谈了一次，但是派性不倒，联合不了，谈判依然没有成功。
    毛泽东思想威力无穷。派性一遇到伟大的毛泽东思想，就原形毕露，无处藏身。去年十二月下旬，我们两派组织的头头参加了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真地亮私心，斗派性，触灵魂。我们认识到，过去由于闹派性，阶级兄弟不相认，斗、批、改没有抓好，也影响了生产和工作。我们决心按照毛主席的最新指示办事，今年一月上旬实现了革命的大联合。
      派性使人把阶级兄弟当成眼中钉
      “井冈山”同志的话音刚落，原“硬到底”的同志接着发言：“井冈山”的同志自我批评说，过去谈革命大联合，他们没有诚意；同样，我们“硬到底”也被派性缠住了，甚至还大挖对方的墙脚哩！毛主席说：“要分清敌我，不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志。”可是我们违背了毛主席的这个指示。我们了解到对方在我们组织中做“工作”，要“瓦解”我们的人，我们也就准备瓦解对方，挖对方的墙脚。我暗中和对方组织中的十多人分别谈了话，鼓动他们退出原组织，参加到我们的组织里来。派性这个东西真是害人不浅，中了派性的毒，就会把阶级兄弟看成眼中钉，想尽各种邪门歪道要搞垮兄弟组织。搞垮了兄弟组织对谁有好处？还不是阶级敌人高兴，使革命事业遭受损失。今后，我们再也不上派性的当了！
        派性使我们不能正确对待干部
    接着，原“井冈山”的另一个同志发言，揭露了派性在执行干部政策上的恶果。他说，我们这里的材料主任，在文化大革命初期一个短时间内，执行了资产阶级反动路线，后来群众批判了他的错误，他也检查了几次，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，积极向革命派靠拢。当时，我们认为他是比较好的干部，常找他谈话，有时开会也找他参加，有一度还打算吸收他参加临时工作领导小组。可是不久，我们对他的态度变了，原因是这个干部后来参加了我们的对立组织。本来，干部站出来以后，参加任何一个革命群众组织都是应当允许的。可是，我们从派性出发，容不得他参加对方组织，就借口继续批判资产阶级反动路线，指名第一个就要批判他；而对执行反动路线更严重一些的干部，却不去理会。那天，对方的组织正在开大会，我们硬是要把他找来批判、斗争。对方不放，双方闹得不可开交。第二天狠批了这个干部一阵，随后又找了个借口，让他靠边站了。
    毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示下达以后，我们考虑了干部的状况，觉得这位材料主任总的来说还是好的干部，是应当解放的。可是又一想，解放对方组织中的干部，不行；要想站出来，就要参加我们的组织。派性确实是个反动的东西。我们用派性对待干部，竟连毛主席的指示也不听了，连党的政策也不顾了。
    毛主席教导说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”我们被派性搞昏了头脑，没有正确地对待干部。要站出来的干部，站不出来；应当早站出来的干部，迟迟站不出来，给革命和生产造成了一定损失。现在，我们已经按照毛主席的干部政策解放了这位材料主任，不过在这件事情上表现出来的派性大发作的教训，很需要我们认真记取，再也不能让它兴风作浪！派性缠身，敌我不分
    去年十月十一日，基建队出现了一份传单，是“硬到底”和“压不倒”印发的。传单的开头写着：“最高指示：捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    这段毛主席语录本来是针对阶级敌人说的，可是却被用在《给井冈山兵团战士的公开信》的传单上。
    当时，正是双方派性大发作，闹得不可开交的时候。“硬到底”和“压不倒”为了打击“井冈山”兵团，瓦解对方，便写了这份传单。传单中，把对方的一些负责人称为“一小撮”，要“井冈山”战士“擦亮眼睛，分清敌我”。当然，象这样的传单是不可能起好作用的，它只会使双方的对立情绪更加严重。
    现在，原双方组织的负责人，坐在一起声讨派性的时候，各自揭露了当初本组织如何对毛主席的指示采取实用主义的错误态度，如何引用毛主席语录为自己的派性服务的事实，他们拿出的这份传单就是其中的一例。他们对过去的那种错误做法感到万分痛心和惭愧。他们说，被派性这条毒蛇缠住了，就可能把敌人当同志，把同志当敌人，做出亲痛仇快的事来。
    这个声讨派性的座谈会开得热气腾腾。斗派性，大家越斗劲头越大，相互之间越来越亲密，对毛主席的指示越来越感到英明伟大。座谈会结束时，大家说，这个座谈会虽然结束了，但是对派性的斗争还没有结束。派性是个顽固的敌人，它的根子是“私”字。必须继续斗，经常斗，把私心派性彻底搞臭。大家表示，一定要把毛泽东思想学习班办好，认真斗私批修，全面地落实毛主席的最新指示。　本报记者
