The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Changchun, with the great assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have taken Chairman Mao's latest directives as the guideline, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and promoted the revolutionary great alliance on all fronts in the city, including industry and transportation, suburban agriculture, finance and commerce, party and government agencies, and education and health.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers on the city's industrial and transportation front have played the role of the main force of the proletariat, taking the lead in revolutionary great alliance. Other revolutionary masses, including poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary staff, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary Red Guards, have learned from the proletariat and, with the spirit of "striving for every moment," have accelerated the pace of revolutionary great alliance. Currently, more than 300 units in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliance. In the suburbs, 12 people's communes and 14 vegetable specialized teams, except for one people's commune, have all achieved revolutionary great alliance.

In the past one or two months, various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain in various systems, departments, and units across the city. The People's Liberation Army alone has assisted various revolutionary mass organizations in holding nearly 1,000 study classes, with more than 60,000 heads and backbone members of revolutionary mass organizations participating. They have used Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and his brilliant "Old Five Articles" as weapons, insisted on the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and achieved immediate results by learning and applying what they have learned.

Some units had heads of two revolutionary mass organizations who, when they first entered the study class, had opposing attitudes and could not reach an agreement; some even brought materials and prepared to debate. Under the guidance of the PLA comrades, after recalling past sufferings and bitterness, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and especially after repeatedly and seriously studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "within the proletariat, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions," their class consciousness has greatly improved. They said, revolutionary great alliance is in the fundamental interest of the revolutionary cadres, is a common need to oppose the enemy, and is a guarantee for the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. We have thousands of reasons to unite and no reason to continue to split. Many heads of revolutionary mass organizations, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "if one has made a mistake, one should make self-criticism," deeply examined the root cause of "internal strife" as the instigation of class enemies and the selfishness in their own minds. They took Chairman Mao's latest directives as the guideline, the two sides became closer and closer through learning, and some units' heads of the two sides even formulated the revolutionary great alliance agreement in the study class and implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives.

In the process of achieving revolutionary great alliance, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres in Changchun deeply felt that starting from factionalism, revolutionary great alliance would only be an empty talk, but starting from fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, revolutionary great alliance could be achieved, consolidated, and developed. In the process of achieving revolutionary great alliance, they have always grasped the guideline of "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," exposed factionalism thoroughly, raised party spirit high, and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest directives thoroughly.

    横扫派性　只争朝夕
    长春各条战线革命大联合步伐加快
    据新华社长春二十六日电　长春市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在人民解放军的大力协助下，以落实毛主席最新指示为纲，斗私批修，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，推动全市工业交通、郊区农业、金融财贸、党政机关、文教卫生等各条战线的革命大联合蓬勃发展。
    全市工交战线上的广大革命工人发挥工人阶级的主力军作用，走在革命大联合的最前列，其它各条战线上的广大贫下中农、革命职工、革命知识分子和革命的红卫兵小将，向工人阶级学习，以“只争朝夕”的精神，你追我赶，大大加快了革命大联合的步伐。目前，全市实现革命大联合的单位已有三百多个。郊区十二个人民公社和十四个蔬菜专业队，除一个人民公社外都实现了革命大联合。
    最近一两个月来，全市各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋一样，在各系统、各部门、各单位开办起来。全市仅人民解放军协助各革命群众组织举办的学习班就将近一千期，参加学习的革命群众组织的头头和骨干达六万多人。他们以毛主席的一系列最新指示和光辉的“老五篇”为武器，坚持毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，学了就用，学用结合，立竿见影。
    有些单位两派革命群众组织的头头刚进学习班时，有对立情绪，谈不拢来；有的甚至抱着材料，带着辩论员，准备辩论一场。在解放军同志的引导下，他们经过忆苦思甜和斗私批修，特别是反复认真地学习了毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，阶级觉悟有了很大提高。他们说，革命大联合是无产阶级革命派根本利益所在，是共同对敌的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的保证。我们有着千条万条理由联合起来，没有半条理由继续分裂下去。许多革命群众组织的头头遵照毛主席“自己有了错误，要作自我批评”的教导，深刻地检查了“内战”的根源是阶级敌人的挑拨，是自己头脑中的私字作怪。他们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，两派越学越亲，越谈越近，有些单位的两派头头在学习班里就制定了革命大联合的协议，落实了毛主席的最新指示。
    长春市广大无产阶级革命派在实现革命大联合的过程中，深深体会到，从派性出发，革命大联合只能是一句空话，从斗私批修入手，革命大联合就能实现、巩固和发展。在实现革命大联合的过程中，他们自始至终抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，把派性搞得臭臭的，把党性提得高高的，把毛主席的一系列最新指示落得实实的。
