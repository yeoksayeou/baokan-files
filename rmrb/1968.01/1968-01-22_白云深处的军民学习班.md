In the southern border of our motherland, there is a towering mountain. Halfway up the mountain is a production brigade called "Halfway to the Clouds" with about twenty households. One morning, a series of drumbeats, firecrackers, and lively songs echoed from the depths of the clouds. It turned out that the members of the "Halfway to the Clouds" production brigade were lining the streets to see off the soldiers of the Second Platoon of a certain unit who had just completed a military-civilian Mao Zedong Thought study class together.

Last October, after Mao Chairman's latest instructions reached the border troops, the soldiers of the Second Platoon, like in wartime receiving an urgent combat mission, sprang into action immediately and formulated specific measures to implement the instructions. They decided to hold military-civilian Mao Zedong Thought study classes to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were carried out in every corner of their defense area. When it came to the "Halfway to the Clouds" production brigade, some said, "That's a paradise on earth," how can we go up there to hold a study class? It's just a small village; whether the instructions are implemented or not doesn't matter much. Political Instructor Li Wei'an said, "This is not just a matter of a small village; it's a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I'll take responsibility for this production brigade."

The next day, before dawn, Li, the political instructor, led three soldiers, carrying backpacks, marching towards "Halfway to the Clouds." They climbed the steep mountain for more than two hours. Li, who had suffered from arthritis in his right leg, began to feel a dull pain. But no matter how high the mountain, it couldn't be higher than the soldiers' enthusiasm for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. From morning till noon, they finally reached their destination. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "Consult the masses on every matter and be a student of the masses," participated in labor, and discussed holding military-civilian Mao Zedong Thought study classes. That very evening, they opened the class.

In the military-civilian study class, everyone recalled their class struggles and engaged in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism. Old poor peasant Chen Caiqu had not been very concerned with national affairs, but after participating in the study class, his class consciousness was raised through revolutionary criticism. He strongly denounced the fallacies of China's Khrushchev, such as "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "exploitation is a merit," and led his son to set up two columns in the village: "Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions" and "Self-Criticism and Criticism of Revisionism." The awakening of the poor and lower-middle peasants also educated the soldiers.

The military-civilian study class in "Halfway to the Clouds" lasted for six days this time. Li, the political instructor, had to go down the mountain due to a relapse of his arthritis.

The New Year's editorial proposed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions should be fully implemented. Li, the political instructor, pondered: Have Chairman Mao's latest instructions been truly and fully implemented in "Halfway to the Clouds"? That very night, he proposed at the party branch meeting to go up "Halfway to the Clouds" again. His comrades said he had just come out of the hospital and it was not appropriate for him to go up the mountain again, but Li firmly said, "For the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, no difficulty can stop us." The next day, he carried his backpack and led four soldiers up "Halfway to the Clouds" again, holding the second military-civilian Mao Zedong Thought study class with the broad masses of the production brigade.

This class focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, correctly solving the cadre problem in the "Halfway to the Clouds" production brigade. This class lasted for four days. When Li, the political instructor, led the soldiers down the mountain for the second time, the members of the "Halfway to the Clouds" production brigade recalled the help they had received from the military-civilian Mao Zedong Thought study class, tears of gratitude welled up in their eyes, and they held Li's hand, seeing the soldiers off all the way to the foot of the mountain.

    军民团结如一人
    白云深处的军民学习班
    在祖国南方的边防线上，有一座高耸入云的大山。山半腰有个二十来户人家名叫“半天云”的生产队。一天清晨，从白云深处传来了一阵阵锣鼓声、鞭炮声和嘹亮的歌声。原来是“半天云”生产队的社员们，夹道欢送一起举办军民毛泽东思想学习班的某部二连指战员下山。
    去年十月，毛主席的最新指示传到边防部队后，二连指战员就象战争年代接到紧急战斗任务一样，闻风而动，立即制订贯彻落实的具体措施。他们决定通过军民同办毛泽东思想学习班的形式，把毛主席的最新指示落实到防区每一个角落。一提到“半天云”生产队，有的说，那是“世外桃源”，怎么能上去办学习班呢？小小山庄，落实不落实没啥关系。指导员李维和说，这不只是一个小山庄的问题，而是对毛主席革命路线的态度问题。这个生产队我包了。
    第二天，天蒙蒙亮，李指导员领着三个战士，扛着背包，向“半天云”进军。他们在陡峭的高山上爬行了两个多小时，李指导员患过关节炎的右腿，开始感到隐隐作痛。但是，山再高，没有革命战士宣传毛泽东思想的热情高。从早上爬到中午，终于到达了目的地。他们遵照毛主席“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，一边参加劳动，一边商量办军民毛泽东思想学习班，当天晚上就开了学。
    在军民学习班里，大家共忆阶级苦，共同进行斗私批修。老贫农陈彩区原来不大关心国家大事，参加学习班后，革命大批判提高了他的阶级觉悟，他有力地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”“四大自由”“剥削有功”等谬论，并带领儿子在村前搭了两个“毛主席最新指示宣传栏”和“斗私批修专栏”。贫下中农的觉悟，使部队同志也受到了不少教育。
  “半天云”的军民学习班，这期共办了六天。李指导员因关节炎复发下了山。
    元旦社论提出对毛主席的最新指示要条条落实，全面落实。李指导员就琢磨：毛主席的最新指示是不是真正在“半天云”里条条落实，全面落实了呢？当晚，他就在支部会上提出重上“半天云”的要求。同志们说他刚从医院里出来，再次上山不适宜，但李指导员却斩钉截铁地说，为了落实毛主席的最新指示，什么困难，也阻挡不住我们。第二天他就扛上背包，带领四个战士，再次爬上“半天云”，和广大社员共同举办了第二期毛泽东思想学习班。
    这期学习班着重学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，正确解决了“半天云”生产队的队干部问题。这期学习班只办了四天。当李指导员带着战士二次下山的时候，“半天云”生产队的社员们回想起开办军民毛泽东思想学习班对他们的帮助，感动得热泪盈眶，握着李指导员的手，一直把指战员送到山底。
