In the great leader Chairman Mao's concern for the revolutionary workers of the nation's railways

	Premier Zhou conveyed inspiring news at the national railway system conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the active assistance of the People's Liberation Army, all railway bureaus and sub-bureaus across the country have successively reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great unity. We must ensure that every link in the nation's railways is smooth and unobstructed, making new contributions to the great development of industrial and agricultural production and to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: In the midst of the advance towards the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, representatives of the revolutionary masses from all railway bureaus and sub-bureaus across the country gathered in Beijing in a combative posture to attend the conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production. At the meeting, the representatives unanimously issued a steel-like vow, resolving to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any deviation. They will ensure the smooth operation of railway transportation nationwide to meet the greater needs of industrial and agricultural production this year, and achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	This conference was held from January 5th to 13th. Premier Zhou Enlai and other central leaders received all the representatives during the conference. Premier Zhou conveyed Chairman Mao's concern for the revolutionary railway workers at the meeting and gave important instructions. The broad representatives were greatly inspired and educated. They expressed their determination not to disappoint the trust and expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

	Representatives from all railway bureaus and sub-bureaus across the country repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the New Year editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily at the meeting. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" and seriously engaged in self-criticism, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit. Under the radiant light of great Mao Zedong Thought and with the active assistance of the People's Liberation Army, all railway bureaus and sub-bureaus across the country reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great unity before and during the meeting. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The entire meeting became a grand gathering for the great unity and great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the national railway system.

	The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, resolve to fully implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions with their actual actions, not only to be the locomotive of production but also to strive to be the locomotive of the revolution. The representatives believe that the current agreements reached by the two factions in various local railway bureaus to achieve revolutionary great unity are just the beginning of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must fully implement the agreements that have been reached and resolutely resist the impact of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The representatives expressed that the revolutionary organizations of the railway system must sever their connections and subordinate relationships with local revolutionary mass organizations. Revolutionary railway workers must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more broadly carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, break down private interests and establish public interests, continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity, promote revolutionary tripartite alliance, continue to carry out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and launch a revolutionary competition. They vow to be revolutionary masses who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The representatives unanimously pointed out that railways are the lifeline of the national economy. Railway transportation is directly related to the smooth progress of socialist construction and national defense construction, to the lives of urban and rural people, and to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Ensuring the smooth operation of railway transportation nationwide and quickly launching a new high tide of railway transportation production is the most glorious combat mission for the broad revolutionary masses of the national railways. Whether or not to fully implement Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" is an important indicator of whether a person or an organization is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses of the national railways must resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," and set an example in seizing the revolution and promoting production. They must strengthen the centralized and unified command of railway transportation, quickly establish and improve a unified, authoritative, and highly efficient production command team at all levels. Maintain the revolutionary order of railway transportation, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, guard the production posts, and strictly observe labor discipline. Seriously insist on thrift for revolution, local revolution, and spare-time revolution, with a high sense of responsibility as masters of the state, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and strive to complete and overfulfill transportation production tasks. The representatives also expressed their determination to resolutely oppose anarchism, resolutely resist the counter-revolutionary economic wind of capitalism, and wage an uncompromising struggle against all actions that disrupt the order of railway transportation; to resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," vow to form a steel wall with the People's Liberation Army to defend proletarian dictatorship and defend the socialist mountains and rivers, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and prevent the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and class enemies. The representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations of all railway bureaus and sub-bureaus made specific measures at the meeting to ensure that every link in the nation's railways is smooth and unobstructed, making new contributions to the great development of industrial and agricultural production and to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    新华社二十日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，全国各铁路局和分局的无产阶级革命派代表，以战斗的姿态聚集在北京，参加抓革命促生产会议。会上，代表们一致发出钢铁誓言，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地全面落实毛主席的最新指示，保证全国铁路运输畅通无阻，以满足今年工农业生产更大发展的需要，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。
    这次会议是一月五日到十三日举行的。周恩来总理和中央其他领导同志在会议期间接见了全体代表。周总理在会上传达了伟大领袖毛主席对铁路革命职工的关怀，并作了重要指示。广大代表受到极大的鼓舞，极大的教育。他们表示一定不辜负党中央和毛主席的信任和期望。
    来自全国各铁路局和各铁路分局的无产阶级革命派，在会上反复地逐字逐句地学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论。他们遵照毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，认真做自我批评，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在人民解放军的积极帮助下，全国所有铁路局和铁路分局在会前和会上先后全部达成了实现革命大联合的协议。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。整个会议变成了全国铁路系统无产阶级革命派大团结、大联合的大会。
    毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。代表们表示，具有“二七”光荣革命传统的全国革命铁路职工，坚决听毛主席的话，决心以自己的实际行动来全面落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，不仅作生产的火车头，而且要争作革命的
  “火车头”。代表们认为，目前各地铁路局两派组织达成实现革命大联合的协议，只是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的开始。要不折不扣地实现已达成的协议，还要坚决抵制资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的冲击。代表们表示，铁路系统的各革命群众组织，要脱离与地方革命群众组织的串连和隶属关系。革命的铁路职工，一定要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，破私立公，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合，继续进行革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，开展革命大竞赛，誓做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    代表们一致指出，铁路是国民经济的大动脉。铁路运输直接关系到社会主义建设和国防建设的顺利进行，关系到城乡人民生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。保证全国铁路运输畅通无阻，最迅速地掀起铁路运输生产新高潮，是全国铁路广大无产阶级革命派最光荣的战斗任务。能否不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，是识别一个人、一个组织是否忠于毛主席、是否忠于毛泽东思想、是否忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。全国铁路无产阶级革命派要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，当好抓革命促生产的模范。要切实加强铁路运输的集中统一指挥，在各级迅速建立与健全统一的、有权威的、有高度效能的生产指挥班子。维护铁路运输的革命秩序，加强革命的组织纪律性，坚守生产岗位，严格遵守劳动纪律。认真坚持节约闹革命，就地闹革命，业余闹革命，以国家主人翁的高度责任感，挑起革命和生产两副重担，努力完成和超额完成运输生产任务。代表们还表示要坚决反对无政府主义，坚决抵制反革命的经济主义妖风，同破坏铁路运输秩序的一切行为作毫不调和的斗争；要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的号召，誓与人民解放军结成保卫无产阶级专政、保卫社会主义江山的钢铁长城，提高革命警惕性，严防党内一小撮走资派和阶级敌人的破坏活动。各铁路局和铁路分局的革命群众组织代表，都在会上订出具体措施，以保证全国铁路的每一个环节都能畅通无阻，为工农业生产的大发展，为无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，做出新的贡献。
