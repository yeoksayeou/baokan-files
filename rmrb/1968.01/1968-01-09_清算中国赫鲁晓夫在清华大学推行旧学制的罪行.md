The educational system of our higher education institutions is entirely a product of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Over the past seventeen years, bourgeois intellectuals have used this system to control our schools. Tsinghua University has been a "test field" for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field, such as Lu Dingyi and Jiang XX, to implement this system and carry out the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

In 1952, Jiang XX was dispatched by the counter-revolutionary conspirator Peng Zhen to Tsinghua University. The following year, he inherited the old system of Tsinghua University and, following the black directive of the Chinese Khrushchev to "bring it over and then talk," copied the Soviet Union's engineering university system, extending the original four-year program to five years. At the same time, he abolished the two-year specialized program for workers and peasants. In April 1954, when the Chinese Khrushchev "inspected" Tsinghua University, he highly praised this.

In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor," revolutionary teachers and students launched a vigorous educational revolution, shaking the rule of bourgeois intellectuals in the schools. The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely resisted, shouting, "Students participating in labor, under no circumstances can weaken the foundation theory." He instructed Jiang XX to conduct a "pilot" at Tsinghua University and specifically "instructed" that to "ensure quality is not reduced," the educational system could be "appropriately extended." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi also shouted, "Universities implementing half-work, half-study cannot reduce quality, but can extend the duration appropriately." With the support of the Chinese Khrushchev and Lu Dingyi, Jiang XX extended the original five-year program by one more year.

In 1959, Lu Dingyi planned to implement an eight-year system at the China Medical University and asked Jiang XX, "Do you have the ambition to implement a ten-year system? Give you nine to ten years, first study theory, then study engineering, produce high-quality personnel." Jiang XX received Lu Dingyi's order and decided to implement a nine-and-a-half-year system: six and a half years for the undergraduate program; restore the graduate system, study for three years. At the same time, he increased the theoretical foundation course hours by twenty percent but cut the labor time by nearly half.

In the spring of 1964, our great leader Chairman Mao made a series of extremely important instructions on educational work. Jiang XX stubbornly held onto the old educational system, resisted the educational revolution, and sang in opposition to Chairman Mao. He proposed the reactionary slogan of "three immovables" in the educational system, curriculum setting, and professional equipment, shouting for "stability in action," and that the teaching plan should "retain the framework of basic courses, technical foundation courses, and professional courses," and "continue with the consistent thought." He even wildly shouted: "The Spring Festival instructions, how about for the sciences? Need further research." His counter-revolutionary face was fully exposed!

In September 1964, Jiang XX further proposed to "link the preparatory, undergraduate, and graduate programs into one continuous system," creating a "three-stage rocket." He established a two-year preparatory program at Tsinghua University Middle School as the foundation; in the university, he gradually shortened the six-year program to five years by reducing students' participation in the Four Clean-ups and military service; in the fourth year, he selected a portion of the "elite" to enter the graduate preparatory program for two years; from the graduates of the graduate preparatory program, he selected one to three percent to enter the graduate school to study for three years. The training goals of the "three-stage rocket" were "engineers," "senior engineers," and "doctors" and "associate doctors." This was a complete copy of the Soviet revisionist educational system. Under the guise of shortening the undergraduate program by one year, Jiang XX actually extended the educational system to nine years.

Thus, Tsinghua University became a stronghold where the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices fiercely resisted the proletarian educational revolution. The proletariat wanted to shorten the educational system and carry out an educational revolution to completely change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools. The bourgeoisie wanted to extend the educational system to maintain the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the schools. Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line were in sharp conflict over the issue of the educational system.

The broad masses of teachers and students at our school have always resisted and fought against the old educational system. Jiang XX, to resist the revolutionary actions of teachers and students, said that the six-year system could "learn better" and "have higher quality" compared to the five-year system, and could cultivate "red engineers" and "high-quality cadres," etc. This is all nonsense!

Jiang XX once proudly said, "Establishing new specialties and extending the educational system are two major strategic measures to ensure high-quality cadres." Indeed, he revealed the "secret"! This is his counter-revolutionary "strategic measure" to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie, and it is part of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary "strategic measure" to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become socially conscious and cultured laborers with socialist awareness." However, the old educational system promoted by Jiang XX was "intellectual education first," eliminating proletarian politics and implementing bourgeois politics in command. It was precisely by promoting this educational system that Jiang XX, together with bourgeois intellectuals, arranged the curriculum, teaching content, and teaching methods according to the requirements of the revisionist educational policy, making students busy with homework, classes, reviews, and exams all day. They made students learn this course and that course, but did not allow them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and did everything possible to obstruct students from participating in the Four Clean-ups and collective production labor. Jiang XX confined students to high walls and deep courtyards, year after year away from social struggles, away from labor, away from workers, peasants, and soldiers, attempting to make young students "peacefully evolve" and turn them into reactionaries. How evil his intentions were!

Jiang XX once admitted: "We should cultivate talents from a young age like Ulanova and Mei Lanfang, with long-term training. Great artists and great scientists must be cultivated in this way." He even used the traitorous scientist who betrayed the country and served American imperialism as the "training goal" for "improving teaching quality." What kind of "high-quality cadres" and "red engineers" Jiang XX boasted about is now clear!

Chairman Mao taught us: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." "Correct ideas of people only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." However, under the shackles of the old educational system, students knew nothing but books and concepts. A graduate from the mechanical engineering department could design machine tool cutters on paper, but when going to the workshop, he couldn't even sharpen a cutter. Jiang XX often boasted that extending the educational system could make students have a "solid foundation" and "comprehensive theory," but in reality, students only learned some "theories" from bourgeois academic "authorities."

Youth is the time for growth. However, heavy courses, large amounts of homework, and sudden surprise exams pressed us down for a long time, seriously damaging our physical and mental health.

Revolutionary students angrily denounced: "After six years in Tsinghua, the 'public' character is reduced, but the 'private' character is increased, the labor viewpoint and feelings for workers and peasants are weakened, health has deteriorated, and the long educational system kills people!" We have an intense hatred for the evil old educational system! We have an intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, Lu Dingyi, Jiang XX, and the like!

"The educational system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must no longer continue." Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts are our sharp weapon for criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and are our fundamental guideline for resuming classes and making revolution. We must launch a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, and greatly advance the proletarian educational revolution.

    清算中国赫鲁晓夫在清华大学推行旧学制的罪行
    清华大学井冈山兵团　仇国平　顾强
    我国高等院校的学制，完全是封建主义、资本主义、修正主义那一套。十七年来，资产阶级知识分子正是利用这种学制统治我们学校的。清华大学是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人陆定一、蒋××之流推行这种学制，实行反革命修正主义教育路线的一个“试验田”。
    一九五二年，蒋××受反革命野心家彭真指派来清华大学。第二年，他便在继承旧清华大学的基础上，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫“搬过来再说”的黑指示，照抄苏联工科大学学制，把原来的四年制延长为五年制。同时，他又砍去为工农学生设立的两年制专修科。一九五四年四月，中国赫鲁晓夫到清华大学“视察”时，对此大为赏识。
    一九五八年，广大革命师生在毛主席提出的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针的指引下，大搞勤工俭学，掀起了轰轰烈烈的教育革命高潮，冲击资产阶级知识分子统治学校的宝座。中国赫鲁晓夫拚命抵抗，大叫“学生参加劳动，无论如何不能削弱基础理论。”他要蒋××在清华大学搞“试点”，并特地“指示”说：“为了保证不降低质量”，“可以适当延长学制”。反革命修正主义分子陆定一也大叫：“大学搞半工半读，不能降低质量，可酌量延长年限。”在中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一的支持下，蒋××便把原来的五年制又延长了一年。
    一九五九年，陆定一策划在中国医科大学实行八年制，并问蒋××：“你有没有雄心壮志搞十年制？给你九年到十年时间，先学理后学工，出高质量人材。”蒋××领回陆定一的旨意，便决定搞九年半制：大学本科六年半；再恢复研究生制度，学三年。同时，他把基础理论的学时增加百分之二十，却把劳动时间几乎砍掉一半。
    一九六四年春节，我们伟大领袖毛主席对教育工作作了一系列极其重要的指示。蒋××死守住旧学制不放，抵制教育革命，同毛主席大唱反调。他提出学制、课程设置、专业装置“三不变动”的反动口号，叫嚷要“行动稳妥”，教学计划“保留基础课、技术基础课、专业课的架子”，“要按一贯的思想搞下去”。他甚至狂叫：春节指示“对理工科如何？要进一步研究”。矛头直指伟大领袖毛主席，其反革命面目暴露无遗！
    一九六四年九月，蒋××进一步提出“把预科、本科、研究院联成一条龙”，搞“三级火箭”。他在清华大学附中搞了个两年制的预科作为基础；在大学用减少学生参加四清、当兵等时间的方法，逐步由六年缩为五年；在四年级中挑一部分“尖子”，编入研究生预科学两年；从研究生预科毕业生中再挑出百分之一到三，进研究院学三年。“三级火箭”的培养目标，分别是“工程师”、“高级工程师”和“博士”“副博士”。这完全是苏修学制的翻版。蒋××在大学本科缩短一年的幌子下，竟把学制变相延长为九年。
    这样，清华大学就成了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙疯狂抵制无产阶级教育革命的顽固阵地。无产阶级要缩短学制，进行教育革命，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。资产阶级则要延长学制，维护资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。毛主席的无产阶级教育路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，在学制问题上展开着尖锐的斗争。
    我校广大师生对旧学制一贯有抵制有斗争。蒋××为了抵抗师生的革命行动，说什么六年制可以比五年制“学得好一些，质量高一些”，可以培养“红色工程师”、“高质量干部”等等。这完全是鬼话！
    蒋××曾经得意地说：“设立新专业和延长学制是保证高质量干部的两个重大战略措施。”真是一语泄露了“天机”！这就是他为资产阶级培养接班人的反革命“战略措施”，就是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的反革命“战略措施”的一部分。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”而蒋××推行的旧学制，则是“智育第一”，取消无产阶级政治，实行资产阶级政治挂帅。正是推行了这种学制，蒋××伙同资产阶级知识分子，按照修正主义教育方针的要求，安排了课程设置、教学内容和教学方法，使学生成天忙于作业、上课、复习、考试。他们要学生学这门课学那门课，就是不让学生活学活用毛主席著作，并千方百计阻挠学生参加四清、参加集体生产劳动。蒋××把学生束缚在高楼深院里，长年脱离社会斗争、脱离劳动、脱离工农兵，妄图使青年学生“和平演变”过去，用心何其毒也！
    蒋××曾经不打自招地说：“要象乌兰诺娃和梅兰芳那样从小就着手拔尖培养，进行长期训练。大艺术家、大科学家都得这样培养。”他还竟然以背叛祖国、为美帝国主义服务的反动科学家作为“提高教学质量”的“培养目标”。蒋××吹嘘的“高质量干部”、“红色工程师”究竟是什么货色，不是很清楚了吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”但是，学生在旧学制的枷锁下，除了书本还是书本，除了概念还是概念，别的什么也不知道。机械系的毕业生会在图纸上设计车床刀具，可是到车间去连车刀都不会磨。蒋××常常吹嘘延长学制可以使学生“基础扎实”、“理论全面”，其实学生学到的不过是资产阶级学术“权威”故弄玄虚的一些“理论”而已。
    青年正是长身体时期。但是繁重的课程、大量的作业、突然袭击式的考试，长期压得我们喘不过气来，严重摧残了我们的身心健康。
    广大革命学生愤怒控诉说：“在清华呆了六年，‘公’字少了，‘私’字却多了，劳动观点、工农感情淡漠了，健康也变坏了，长学制害死人！”我们对万恶的旧学制无比痛恨！对中国赫鲁晓夫、陆定一、蒋××之流无比痛恨！
    “学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的教育革命思想，是我们批判反革命修正主义教育路线的锐利武器，是我们复课闹革命的根本指针。我们一定要掀起一个活学活用毛主席教育革命思想的群众运动，把无产阶级教育革命大大推进一步。
