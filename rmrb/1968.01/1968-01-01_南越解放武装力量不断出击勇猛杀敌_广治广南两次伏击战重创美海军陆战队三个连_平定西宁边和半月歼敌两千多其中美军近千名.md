The valiant and skilled liberation forces of South Vietnam in the provinces of Quang Tri and Quang Nam launched two brilliant ambushes on January 27 and 28 in areas about 30 kilometers southeast of the demilitarized zone and in the area around Hue. They inflicted heavy losses on three companies of the U.S. Marine Corps, killing and wounding nearly 200 American aggressors.

According to Western news agencies, these two battles occurred when the U.S. Marine Corps conducted "sweeps" in the relevant areas of Quang Tri and Quang Nam. As soon as the enemy landed by helicopter and boat at the "sweep" sites, the well-prepared local liberation forces opened fierce fire, catching the American aggressors off guard and delivering a heavy blow. The disoriented enemy rushed to escape but was tightly pursued by the liberation forces. The liberation forces, filled with deep hatred for the American invaders, quickly charged forward and engaged in close combat, killing and wounding many American soldiers, rendering the enemy's rescue aircraft and artillery ineffective.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation forces in the provinces of Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Tuy in South Vietnam have been continuously launching fierce attacks on enemy bases, strongholds, bunkers, and supply lines over the past half month, killing more than 2,000 enemy soldiers, including over 900 American invaders. They completely annihilated two companies of the American invaders, a U.S. military camp command, and a U.S. military convoy, destroying more than 40 tanks and armored vehicles.

The liberation forces in Binh Dinh Province, from January 5 to 14, adopted various flexible tactics to launch continuous attacks on the enemy, killing 1,510 enemy soldiers, including over 400 American invaders.

On the night of January 11, the liberation forces in the district of Tuy Phong in Ninh Thuan Province launched a fierce attack on the American invaders stationed in the area of Luc Hiep in the district of Luc Hiep. After a 30-minute intense battle, they completely annihilated two companies and a camp command of the American invaders, killing and wounding 340 American soldiers, and destroying two enemy mortars.

On the night of January 20, the liberation forces in Binh Tuy Province simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the enemy stationed in the districts of Tan Thuan, along the 15th Highway, and in the town of Long Thanh. The liberation forces successfully captured the stronghold of the Thai mercenaries in the district of Phu Thuan, completely annihilating a company of 120 enemy soldiers.

On the same night, another unit of the liberation forces in Binh Tuy Province launched a surprise attack on a U.S. military convoy stopped in the district of Tan Thanh. After a 20-minute intense battle, they completely destroyed 30 tanks and armored vehicles in the convoy, killing 200 American soldiers, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

    据西方通讯社报道，这两次战斗是美国海军陆战队对广治、广南有关地区进行“扫荡”时发生的。当敌人分别乘直升飞机和船只刚刚在“扫荡”地点着陆时，严阵以待的当地人民解放武装力量，就向他们猛烈开火，给美国强盗以出其不意的沉重打击。被打得晕头转向的敌人慌忙掉头逃命，但被人民解放武装力量紧紧咬住。接着，人民解放武装力量怀着对美国侵略者的深仇大恨，迅速冲上前去，同敌人展开近战，杀得美军死伤累累，使美国侵略者召来救援的飞机大炮完全失去作用。
