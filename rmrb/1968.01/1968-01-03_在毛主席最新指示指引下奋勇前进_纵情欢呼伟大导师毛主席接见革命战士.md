In the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we march forward boldly—joyfully hailing the great teacher Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary warriors

On the afternoon of December 31, 1967, military cadres from the coast of the East China Sea, the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, the south and north banks of the Yangtze River, and inside and outside the Great Wall, as well as representatives of party and government cadres and revolutionary masses from various places who came to Beijing to participate in the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought, and personnel participating in various meetings, gathered in the magnificent and grand People's Great Hall. With boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations and sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman," "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," and "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life."

The most joyful and thrilling moment arrived! Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders, appeared on the rostrum. Instantly, the People's Great Hall was ablaze with lights, and everyone waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!"

Our great leader Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a vigorous stride, walked from one end of the rostrum to the other, smiling and waving to the crowd. The hall was in a frenzy, and the red books formed a sea of red. Countless smiling faces greeted the red sun, and countless red hearts turned towards Chairman Mao. People joyfully shouted and jumped! The slogans "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" echoed louder and louder. Many people, with tears of joy, recorded this most joyful moment on their red books.

When we enthusiastically hailed the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1967 and welcomed its complete victory, our great leader Chairman Mao received revolutionary warriors from all over the country. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, and spur for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We wish you good health every day as we greet the morning sun, and we think of you every night as we gaze at the North Star. Today, we have seen you, and this is the greatest happiness of our lives! We sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, a long life!

On the eve of 1967, the units stationed in Beijing, the troops, and comrades who came to Beijing to participate in the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought were immersed in unprecedented joy and happiness. They enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's reception, the publication of the New Year's editorials by the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily. They said: What is the greatest happiness in the world? Our great leader Chairman Mao is in extremely good health and has boundless energy, which is the greatest happiness. Many comrades wrote letters, made phone calls, and sent telegrams overnight, quickly spreading the joyous news of our red sun Chairman Mao's reception to the front lines in Fujian, the Bohai Sea, the banks of the Songhua River, the coconut groves of the South China Sea, and all over the country. When comrades and family members heard this joyous news over the phone, they immediately shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" Many units held celebrations, oath-taking meetings, and discussions overnight, praising the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They swore before Chairman Mao's portrait that they would definitely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and completely, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that your brilliant thoughts are like the sun, shining wherever they go; your brilliant thoughts are the treasure of revolution, effective wherever they are applied. With your brilliant leadership and your series of latest instructions, we have achieved the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A comrade from a certain academy who was received by Chairman Mao excitedly said: Dear Chairman Mao, every victory achieved in our school's Cultural Revolution is a victory of your brilliant thoughts; every step we advance is the result of your nurturing. We follow your great strategic deployment and resolutely carry out your series of latest instructions. Among countless principles, learning your brilliant thoughts is the first; among countless difficulties, resolutely implementing your latest instructions is not difficult.

Liu Sanxing, a militia cadre from Mishi County, Shaanxi, saw the great leader Chairman Mao whom he had longed for day and night, and his eyes welled up with tears. Liu Sanxing and his comrades from the militia department resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great instruction to "support the broad masses of the left," stood up, and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary factions. Under the white terror of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they stood before Chairman Mao's portrait, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and repeatedly reciting: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength and firm confidence in victory. They, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, repeatedly smashed the plots and tricks of the class enemies and achieved one victory after another. Today, Liu Sanxing came from the front line of supporting the left in the Shaanbei Plateau to Chairman Mao's side, with countless heartfelt words to tell Chairman Mao! He said with deep affection: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The people of Shaanbei miss you dearly. Your brilliant thoughts forever illuminate our Shaanbei people's victorious march forward! We will always follow you, thoroughly implement your latest instructions, and resolutely carry out your latest instructions, determined to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Fan Baokun, who participated in the study class of Mao Zedong Thought in the Navy, is a strong warrior who grew up during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He longed to see the great leader Chairman Mao every day. Three days before Chairman Mao's reception, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep, and with tears of joy, he repeatedly wished Chairman Mao a long life. After Chairman Mao's reception, he said with boundless passion: In the Cultural Revolution, we always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Whatever Chairman Mao asks us to do, we will do it with all our might. Chairman Mao called for launching a revolutionary criticism, and we immediately convened an oath-taking meeting, mobilizing cadres, soldiers, staff, and family members to criticize and attack with their mouths and pens, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev. Fan Baokun swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Every instruction of yours makes us clear-minded and gives us direction. We resolutely carry out your instructions, and that is why we have today's great victory. I will definitely follow your words and implement your latest instructions without the slightest deviation, forever being your good warrior.

After being received by the great leader Chairman Mao, the cadres of a certain military region who participated in the study class of Mao Zedong Thought had surging emotions and boiling blood, and immediately organized a discussion. Everyone deeply felt that the power of Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest, and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions can overcome any difficulty and solve any complex problem. In our support-left areas, there was originally great opposition between the two factions. After seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "each making self-criticisms" and "mutually speaking less about others' shortcomings and mistakes," the effect was immediate, and actions were taken. Each person severely criticized their "self," and launched a fierce attack on their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, effectively promoting revolutionary unity.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your reception has given us boundless strength. Your brilliant thoughts guide our victorious course. The representatives of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the direct units and troops of the Air Force, after being received by Chairman Mao, studied overnight with their comrades in their units, learning Vice Chairman Lin's inscription "The ship sails on the sea with the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," and discussing the achievements of 1967. The active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Operations Department, Chen Hongjie and Luo Xingzhen, said with great excitement: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts have shone into our cockpit and into the hearts of the air force warriors. We have direction in the clouds and fog. The air force warriors carry your quotations into the sky and use your quotations to command battles. They are fearless and full of energy, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. No matter how cunning the enemy is, they can be smashed to pieces! Last year, your air force warriors, following your great instruction to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," shot down eleven enemy aircraft of various types, including the latest American fighter jets, creating the highest record in national air defense operations. Our battle victories are the victories of your brilliant thoughts. In the brilliant year of 1968, we will better implement your latest instructions, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, shoot down more enemy aircraft, defend the country, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and create new merits for the country and the people.

Comrades fighting on the front line of national defense science and technology said with great excitement after being received by Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Under your wise guidance and decisions, our national defense science and technology industry has developed vigorously from a "poor and blank" foundation at a speed unimaginable to imperialism and modern revisionism. We have atomic bombs, missiles, and hydrogen bombs. Every step of our magnificent battle journey, which one is not the result of your wise leadership! Every thousand difficulties and ten thousand dangers we have overcome, which one is not the result of your brilliant thoughts guiding us! Every peak we have climbed, they all shine with the brilliant light of your revolutionary line!

Most beloved Chairman Mao, you best understand the feelings of the masses, care for our growth the most, and are always heart to heart with us. Your reception has given us the greatest motivation to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A warrior who participated in the study class of Mao Zedong Thought and was received by Chairman Mao said with deep class feelings: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your wise instruction that "military study classes should include soldiers" is the greatest concern and encouragement for us. I came to Beijing, day and night, longing to see you. Every morning when I wake up, I wish you a long life! This warrior recalled the bitter family history of the old society and said: It is you who saved my whole family from the bitter sea of the old society, and it is you who nurtured me into a revolutionary warrior. Without you, I would have nothing. I will definitely be forever loyal to you, fighting to defend your revolutionary line in life and dying to defend your revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! A thousand victories, ten thousand victories, following your great strategic deployment is the greatest victory; a thousand victories, ten thousand victories, resolutely implementing your latest instructions is the greatest victory.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your kindness is deeper than the vast sea and higher than the peaks that touch the clouds. We cannot express our boundless loyalty to you in a thousand words, nor can we sing your praises in a thousand songs.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this most joyful day of your personal reception, we swear to you: In the new year, we will definitely hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, better study and apply your brilliant works. For every one of your latest instructions, we will act immediately, implement them word for word, and implement them thoroughly. We will definitely follow your latest instructions as the guideline, continue to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and resolutely seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the new year, we sincerely wish you a long life!
