The Himalayas, towering in the southwestern border of our country, is the longest, highest, and youngest mountain range on Earth. It stretches over 2,400 kilometers in length and is about 200 kilometers wide from north to south. The peaks are densely packed, and from an airplane, it looks like a vast expanse of frozen waves. The world's highest peak, Mount Everest, is located at the border between China and Nepal. It stands like a giant pyramid, majestically towering above the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas.

How were the Himalayas and Mount Everest formed?

The natural world always leaves its traces. Whenever one enters the mountains, whether on the peaks, slopes, or valleys, one can see layers of rocks. Some of these rocks contain fossilized remains of animals and plants that lived millions of years ago. Preliminary investigations have revealed that within China's borders, sedimentary metamorphic rock layers formed about 500 million years ago are over 20,000 meters thick. Sedimentary rock layers formed between 500 million and 25 million years ago are over 13,000 meters thick. Scientists use these "volumes" of geological history to uncover the history of Mount Everest.

As the great leader Chairman Mao said, "From the standpoint of dialectical materialism, the changes in nature are mainly due to the development of internal contradictions within nature." The origin of Mount Everest is the result of the unified movement of the Earth's crust in the Himalayan region. Like any other matter, the Himalayas have a process of birth, development, and eventual demise. This process "manifests its changes in units of tens of millions of years," although it is not easily noticeable, it is indeed changing ceaselessly.

According to geological surveys of strata and structures in the field, as well as indoor identification and analysis of a large number of rock and fossil specimens, in the very ancient past, about 600 million years ago, during the Precambrian era, the Himalayan region was a very active and constantly changing sea trench. Later, this trench expanded and connected with the ancient Mediterranean Sea, making the ancient Mediterranean Sea part of the Himalayan Sea. From about 600 million to 25 million years ago, during the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, specifically the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs, this ancient sea basin underwent many complex changes due to the uplift and subsidence of the Earth's crust. Due to the continuous subsidence of the basin, it received sediment from the erosion of land on the north and south sides (the north being the Angara ancient land, the south being the Gondwana ancient land), as well as material from the Earth's interior ejected by multiple submarine volcanic eruptions. This sediment, consisting of sand, clay, calcium, and volcanic material, gradually formed thick layers of sedimentary rock.

When the time came to about 30 million years ago, the Himalayan Sea experienced its greatest historical upheaval. First, the sea water retreated to the southwest and southeast, turning the former sea bottom into land, and the history of the ancient sea ended, uniting the land on the north and south sides into the unified Eurasian continent. Strong mountain-building movements caused the thick layers of sedimentary rock to fold, fracture, uplift, and subside, accompanied by the intrusion of magma and regional metamorphism, producing a rich variety of mineral resources. Geologists call this movement the "Himalayan Movement." After this, the world's youngest mountain range, the Himalayas, gradually rose.

Although the Himalayas have been born, the crustal movements have not ceased. The presence of "valleys within valleys" in the river valleys of the Mount Everest region, new fractures in the Quaternary deposits, old hot springs replaced by new ones, earthquakes, and other phenomena all indicate that the crust is still rising, and new tectonic movements are very active. According to the discovery of high-altitude oak and rhododendron fossils in the sandstone of the late Tertiary period, it is estimated that some parts of the Himalayas have risen about 3,000 meters in the past million years. This investigation also found fossils of plants such as the Rosaceae, Menispermaceae, and Ericaceae in the travertine of the Holocene epoch. Based on this, it is estimated that some parts of the Himalayas have experienced significant uplift in recent times. Mount Everest is a result of the long-term intense action of a fault that has risen to form a rock layer.

Due to the rise of the Himalayas, it has had a significant impact on the natural world and human activities. Conducting a comprehensive scientific investigation of it, uncovering its secrets, is essential for the Chinese people to utilize, transform, and conquer nature, serving the socialist construction of our country.

    珠穆朗玛峰的由来
    耸立在我国西南边陲的喜马拉雅山，是地球上最长、最高、最年轻的山脉。它全长两千四百多公里，南北宽约二百多公里，峰峦重迭，从飞机上俯视，犹如凝固的万顷波涛。世界上第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰，位于我国同尼泊尔接界处，它象一座巨型的金字塔，巍然屹立在白雪皑皑的喜马拉雅山的群峰之上。
    喜马拉雅山和珠穆朗玛峰是怎样形成的呢？
    自然界的历程，总是到处留下它的痕迹。人们一进到山里，无论在山顶、山坡或河谷里，都看到许多成层的岩石，而且有的岩石中还包含着已经石化了的、曾经生存在亿万年前的动植物的遗体和遗迹。这次考察初步查明，在我国境内，距今五亿年前形成的沉积变质岩层厚达两万多米，距今五亿至两千五百万年间形成的海相沉积岩层厚达一万三千多米。科学工作者就根据这些纪录着地质历史的“万卷书”来揭露珠穆朗玛峰的历史。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席所说：“按照唯物辩证法的观点，自然界的变化，主要地是由于自然界内部矛盾的发展。”珠穆朗玛峰的由来，也就是喜马拉雅山地区地壳物质对立统一运动的结果。喜马拉雅山同其它任何事物一样，有它的发生、发展、直到将来必然消亡的过程。这种变化过程“是以若干万年为单位而显现其变化的”，尽管不易很明显地为人们觉察到，但它确实是在永不停息地变化着。
    据科学考察人员对地层、构造的野外观察，以及室内对岩石、化石等大量标本的鉴定和分析表明，在非常远古的年代，大约距今六亿年前，即地质历史的隐生代，现在的喜马拉雅山区是一个非常活动的、不断变迁的海槽。以后，这个海槽不断扩大，并和古地中海沟通，使古地中海成为喜马拉雅海的一部分。在大约距今六亿至二千五百万年间，经历了地质历史的古生代、中生代、新生代第三纪的古新世、始新世、渐新世，在这漫长的岁月里，在地壳升降运动的作用下，这个古海盆地经历了许多复杂的变化。由于盆地的不断下沉，接受了来自南北两侧陆地（北为安哥拉古陆，南为岗瓦拉古陆）冲刷下来的泥土、砂石，和由于多次海底火山喷发而抛出的地壳内部的物质，沉淀了砂质、粘土质、钙质和火山质的淤泥，渐渐形成了巨厚的沉积岩层。
    当时间推移到大约距今三千万年左右，喜马拉雅海域经历了历史上最大的动荡时期，先是海水向西南和东南退出，沧海变桑田，原先的海底变成了陆地，古海的历史从此结束，使南北两侧的陆地联合成了统一的欧亚大陆。强烈的造山运动，使得巨厚的沉积岩层发生了折皱、断裂、隆起、坳陷，并伴随着岩浆的侵入以及区域变质作用，产生了非常丰富的矿产资源。这个运动，地质工作者叫做“喜马拉雅运动”。在这之后，世界上最年轻的山脉——喜马拉雅山逐渐挺身而起。
    喜马拉雅山虽已诞生了，但地壳运动并没有结束。在珠穆朗玛峰地区的河谷中普遍发育着“谷中谷”，第四纪沉积物发生新断裂，老温泉被新温泉代替，地震等等现象，都说明地壳在不断地上升着，新构造运动十分活跃。据科学考察人员在第三纪末期的砂岩中找到的高山栎及毡毛栎化石判断，近一百万年以来，喜马拉雅山的某些地段上升了三千米左右。这次考察，又在第四纪的全新世的石灰华中找到了鼠李科、马钱科、杜鹃花科等植物化石。据此判断，喜马拉雅山的某些地段，在近期又有大幅度的上升。珠穆朗玛峰就是喜马拉雅山的一个强烈的长期作用的断裂而上升的岩层构成的。
    由于喜马拉雅山的升起，对自然界和人类活动产生了巨大影响。对它进行全面的科学考察，揭开它的秘密，对于我国人民利用、改造和征服自然，为我国的社会主义建设服务，是必不可少的。　（新华社）
