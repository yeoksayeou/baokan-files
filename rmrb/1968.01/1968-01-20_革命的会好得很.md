Revolutionary Meetings Are Excellent

		Song Liying
		Deputy Secretary of the Daqiao Brigade Party Branch and Chair of the Women's Federation

		“Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the entire Party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not accomplished, the Party’s political tasks cannot be completed.” Our Daqiao Brigade Party Branch, following Chairman Mao’s instructions, frequently uses meetings to intensify political and ideological education for Party members and the masses, promoting the revolutionization of people’s thinking. The Party Branch holds several Party member meetings each month and convenes community meetings at irregular intervals. Additionally, there are field meetings and dining hall meetings. Since the Cultural Revolution, we have continuously held large-scale criticism meetings. All these meetings are revolutionary meetings, and they are excellent.

		The old counter-revolutionary, Liu Shaoqi, opposes anything beneficial to the revolution and anything that strengthens the Party’s fighting capacity. Even the Party holding meetings, he hates and fears. He once insidiously advocated, “A half-day meeting is not as good as going to a market to buy a few pounds of grain.” He also maliciously cursed the Party’s meetings, comparing them to the reactionary taxes imposed by the Kuomintang, saying, “The Kuomintang has ten thousand taxes, the Communist Party has ten thousand meetings.” Liu Shaoqi’s opposition to meetings and cursing of meetings is an attempt to obstruct us from mastering Mao Zedong Thought, to make us abandon political and ideological education, and to turn Party members into politically indifferent fools, so that they can be tools for his restoration of capitalism.

		We hold revolutionary meetings. Revolutionary meetings are excellent! Since our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have conveyed Chairman Mao’s latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution through meetings, greatly raising the political and ideological awareness of the masses. We have carried out the “four bigs” (big debates, big wall posters, big speeches, and big struggles), severely criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party represented by Liu Shaoqi, and eliminating their poison in the countryside aimed at restoring capitalism. Each meeting is a lively class education course. Every meeting boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and demoralizes the enemy. After meetings, political and ideological awareness is raised, promoting the development of productive forces. These revolutionary meetings are only feared by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

		We also pay attention to not holding too many meetings, especially not holding meetings without preparation. Meetings should be held, but more meetings are not necessarily better. This is completely different from Liu Shaoqi’s malicious attacks. Liu Shaoqi opposes meetings because he fears that Party members and the masses will raise their class consciousness and rise up against him, making his dream of restoring capitalism impossible. Of course, whether he opposes meetings or fears rebellion, it is all in vain. Now, the broad revolutionary masses are using various forms to expose, criticize, and struggle against him, including holding criticism meetings as an important form.

### 革命的会好得很

    革命的会好得很
    大寨大队党支部副书记妇代会主任  宋立英
      “掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们大寨党支部遵照毛主席的这一教导，经常运用开会这种形式，狠抓对党员、社员群众的政治思想教育，促进人的思想革命化。党支部每月要开几次党员大会，不定期地召开社员会。另外还有地头会、饭场会。文化大革命以来，接二连三地召开大批判会。这些会都是革命的会，好得很。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，凡是有利于革命，能够加强党的战斗力的事，他都反对。连党开会这种事，他也恨得要命，怕得要死。他曾经转弯抹角鼓吹说：“开半天会，不如去赶一个集，搞几斤粮食。”他还恶毒地咒骂党开会，把我们党的会比作反动派的苛捐杂税，胡说什么：“国民党万税，共产党万会”。中国赫鲁晓夫反对开会，咒骂开会，就是妄图阻挠我们掌握毛泽东思想，要我们取消政治思想教育，把党员变成不关心政治的糊涂人，好给他当复辟资本主义的工具。
    我们开的是革命的会。革命的会，就是好得很！我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命开始后，我们通过会议传达了毛主席对文化大革命的最新指示，大大提高了广大社员的政治思想觉悟，开展了大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，狠批了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资派，肃清了他们在农村复辟资本主义的流毒。开一次会，就是一堂生动的阶级教育课。每一次会都大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。开了会，提高了政治思想觉悟，就促进生产力发展。这种革命的会，只有党内一小撮走资派害怕，地、富、反、坏分子害怕。
    我们自己也注意不要过多地开会，特别是不要开没有准备的会。要开会，但又不是开会越多越好。这和中国赫鲁晓夫的恶意攻击完全是两回事。中国赫鲁晓夫反对开会，是怕党员、群众提高了阶级觉悟，起来造他的反，他复辟资本主义的梦就做不成了。当然，他反对开会也罢，怕造他的反也罢，都是白费心机。现在广大革命群众正运用各种形式对他进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，其中就包括开批判会这种重要的形式。
