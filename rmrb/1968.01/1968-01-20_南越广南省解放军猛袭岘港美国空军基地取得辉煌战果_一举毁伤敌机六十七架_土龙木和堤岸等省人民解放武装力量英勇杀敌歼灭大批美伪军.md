The Liberation Army of South Vietnam's Quang Nam Province launched a daring raid on the U.S. air base in Da Nang early on the morning of the 3rd, achieving a brilliant victory. They destroyed and damaged 67 enemy aircraft and annihilated 150 U.S. aggressor pilots and technical personnel.

In this daring raid, the shells fired by the Liberation Army's forces accurately hit the targets within the base, causing two ammunition depots, a large area of U.S. aggressor barracks, and dormitories to explode and burn fiercely. More than 30% of the equipment within the airport was destroyed. The fires within the base burned until 10:00 AM the same day. Due to the severe damage to the airport's runway, apron, and other buildings and facilities within the base, the airport was paralyzed for several days.

Since June 30, 1965, the brave and skilled Liberation Army forces of Quang Nam Province have launched seven attacks on this U.S. air base, destroying and damaging a total of 320 enemy aircraft, annihilating more than 1,500 enemy personnel, including over 1,400 U.S. aggressor troops, destroying and damaging 356 enemy vehicles, burning nearly 10 million liters of gasoline, and destroying a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

According to another report, the Liberation Army forces of this province also launched two attacks on the enemy in Khe Sanh County on the night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, completely annihilating a company of U.S. aggressor troops, capturing the command post of the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade, destroying two enemy cannons, destroying and damaging 11 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down one enemy aircraft.

The Liberation Army forces of Quang Nam Province also annihilated a company of the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade in Khe Sanh County on the morning of the 5th and shot down one enemy aircraft.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19, the Liberation Army forces of Tuyen Duc and Dinh Tuong provinces in South Vietnam have recently continuously bravely fought against the enemy, annihilating a large number of U.S. and puppet troops.

On January 6, local forces in Chau Doc County, Tuyen Duc Province, fiercely intercepted a company of U.S. aggressor troops conducting a "sweep" in the Gai Yang area. After an intense battle, they annihilated them all. Before this, local forces in this county also killed and wounded more than 200 puppet troops on December 28 last year and shot down two enemy aircraft.

The Liberation Army forces of Dinh Tuong Province launched fierce attacks on the enemy in Phuong Dinh and Long Phuong communes in Chau Doc County and the Di An base from the 8th to the 10th, annihilating a large number of enemy troops, including completely annihilating a company of U.S. aggressor troops, heavily damaging another company, shooting down nine enemy helicopters transporting troops, damaging three, and destroying two enemy outposts.

According to another report, the Liberation Army forces in the northern region of Quang Tri Province engaged in a close-quarters battle with the enemy on the 7th and ambushed a U.S. military convoy on the 13th. In these two days of fighting, they annihilated 280 U.S. Marine Corps troops, destroyed eight military vehicles, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.
