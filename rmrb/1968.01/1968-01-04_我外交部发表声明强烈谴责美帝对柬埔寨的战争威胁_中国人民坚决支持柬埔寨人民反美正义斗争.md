The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on January 3, 1968, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's war threats against Cambodia. The Chinese people resolutely support the Cambodian people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

	New China News Agency, January 3rd: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on January 3rd. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On December 26, 1967, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's war threats against Cambodia. The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism that if it invades Cambodia, it "will face the tenacious resistance of the Cambodian military and people," and Cambodia will "immediately appeal to friendly countries for direct assistance." The Chinese government and people resolutely support the Royal Government of Cambodia's stern position.

	In recent times, U.S. imperialism and its puppets in South Vietnam and Thailand have, on the one hand, repeatedly violated Cambodia's territory, and on the other hand, have continuously issued war threats against Cambodia, claiming that they have "discovered" bases of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army within Cambodia, that Cambodia has "provided" military supplies to the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, and even threatening to "blockade" Sihanoukville and to "pursue" the "Viet Cong" troops across the Cambodian border. On December 4, 1967, the U.S. government went so far as to officially notify the Royal Government of Cambodia, spreading lies and creating various pretexts for its aggression against Cambodia. This action by U.S. imperialism is the most blatant war blackmail against the Kingdom of Cambodia.

	The above series of conspiracies by U.S. imperialism show that it is accelerating its steps to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to Cambodia and the entire Indochina region. This is the desperate struggle of U.S. imperialism. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The days of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are numbered. However, all reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles. They will inevitably resort to various military adventures and political deceptions to save themselves from destruction." It can be foreseen that U.S. imperialism's adventurism to expand the war will not end well. It will certainly, as stated in the Royal Government of Cambodia's statement, face the resolute resistance of the Cambodian people. It will certainly suffer a complete defeat in the face of the united struggle of the peoples of the Indochina countries.

	The Chinese government and people have always resolutely supported the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people in their just struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression. At present, the Chinese government is closely watching the development of the situation and solemnly declares: If U.S. imperialism dares to launch an aggressive war against Cambodia, the Chinese government and people will not stand idly by; the 700 million Chinese people will take all necessary and effective measures to support the Cambodian people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression.

### 我外交部发表声明强烈谴责美帝对柬埔寨的战争威胁  中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨人民反美正义斗争

    我外交部发表声明强烈谴责美帝对柬埔寨的战争威胁
    中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨人民反美正义斗争
    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部三日发表一项声明，声明全文如下：
    一九六七年十二月二十六日，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义对柬埔寨的战争威胁。声明严正警告美帝国主义：如果它侵犯柬埔寨，“将遭到柬埔寨军民的顽强抵抗”，柬埔寨并将“立即呼吁友好国家给予直接援助”。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府这一严正立场。
    最近一个时期以来，美帝国主义及其仆从南越和泰国傀儡，一方面不断侵犯柬埔寨的领土，另一方面接连向柬埔寨发出战争威胁，说什么在柬埔寨境内“发现”南越解放军的“驻地”，柬埔寨向南越解放军“提供”了“军需品”，还叫嚷什么要“封锁西哈努克港”，要越过柬埔寨边境“穷追”“越共部队”。一九六七年十二月四日，美国政府更公然照会柬埔寨王国政府，大造谣言，为它侵略柬埔寨制造了种种借口。美帝国主义的这一行动，是它对柬埔寨王国一次最露骨的战争讹诈。
    美帝国主义上述一系列的阴谋活动说明，它正在加快步伐，要把侵略越南的战争扩大到柬埔寨和整个印度支那地区。这是美帝国主义的垂死挣扎。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席英明指出的：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。但是，一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”可以肯定，美帝国主义这种扩大战争的冒险绝不会有好下场。它必将如柬埔寨王国政府的声明所说，遭到柬埔寨人民的坚决抵抗。它必将在印度支那各国人民同仇敌忾、共同战斗的面前，遭到彻底的失败。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。现在，中国政府正密切注意局势的发展，并且郑重声明：如果美帝国主义胆敢向柬埔寨发动侵略战争，中国政府和中国人民决不会置之不理；七亿中国人民必将采取一切必要的和有效的措施，来支援柬埔寨人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
