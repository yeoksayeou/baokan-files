The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for scientific expeditions. The scientific workers of our comprehensive scientific expedition team have earnestly studied the brilliant philosophical thoughts of Chairman Mao, determined to use the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought to guide the scientific expedition work, and successfully complete this scientific expedition mission. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is hoisted all over the Himalayas, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon Mount Everest.

The scientific workers fighting on the Tibetan Plateau, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, hold the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" before setting out each day, and review Chairman Mao's teachings. The picture shows Mount Everest seen from the north slope at an altitude of five thousand meters. "The masses are the real heroes."

The scientific expedition team emphasizes politics, thoroughly criticizes the revisionist scientific research line, and vigorously implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They closely unite with the local troops and liberated serfs, learn from them, and greatly promote the progress of the scientific expedition work. This is a member of the scientific expedition team asking a Tibetan comrade to introduce the local geological conditions. "Without investigation, no right to speak."

The scientific expedition personnel enter the primitive forests of the Mount Everest region to collect plant specimens and data. (All the pictures in this issue are taken by Xinhua News Agency reporters.) "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory."

With the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in hand and a great ambition in their hearts, the scientific expedition personnel follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, dare to climb peaks that no one has ever climbed, and bravely fight in the high-altitude cold regions, vowing to achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插上世界第一高峰
    ——我国科学工作者对珠穆朗玛峰地区进行大规模多学科的科学考察活动剪影
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想是科学考察工作的灯塔。我国综合科学考察队的科学工作者认真学习毛主席光辉的哲学思想，决心用光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导科学考察工作，胜利完成这次科学考察任务。毛泽东思想红旗插遍喜马拉雅山，毛泽东思想光辉照耀珠穆朗玛峰。
    战斗在西藏高原的科学工作者，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的感情，每天出发之前，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，重温毛主席的教导。图为在北坡海拔五千米处看到的珠穆朗玛峰。“群众是真正的英雄”。
    科学考察队突出政治，大破修正主义的科学研究路线，大力贯彻毛主席的革命路线，和当地驻军与翻身农奴紧密地结合在一起，向他们请教，向他们学习，大大促进了科学考察工作的进展。这是科学考察队员请藏族同胞介绍当地地质情况。“没有调查就没有发言权”。

    《毛主席语录》随身带，雄心壮志满胸怀。科学考察人员遵循毛主席的伟大教导，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，不畏艰难地战斗在高寒山区，誓在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功。
