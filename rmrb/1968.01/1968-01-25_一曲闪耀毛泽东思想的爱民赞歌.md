We are filled with excitement as we introduce to you the touching story of Comrade Bi Zuoxiang from a certain military academy, who, with the struggle against selfishness and revisionism as his guiding principle, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to correctly handle the incident of his child being struck and killed.

The incident occurred on the afternoon of October 18, 1967, around 3 PM.

Wu Zhiping and Xiao Gao, two colleagues from the Nanjing Pukou District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, were riding bicycles to a certain military academy in Nanjing to handle some business. As they rode, they were chatting. When they reached the entrance of a certain club within the academy, Wu Zhiping's bicycle suddenly struck a nine-year-old boy, Bi Zhanjun, who was playing there. The child immediately lost consciousness.

Bi Zuoxiang, the child's father, rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news. The hospital was in the midst of a frantic rescue effort. The doctor told him, "The child is suffering from external injury-induced asphyxia, lung damage, and severe tracheal spasm. Due to the force of the impact, blood has reversed flow, causing cerebral edema. His heart stopped beating for over seven minutes. It looks like he may not survive. Even if he does, he will likely have serious sequelae."

Should he act out of personal grievances, or should he act according to Mao Zedong Thought? At this moment, Bi Zuoxiang's mind was in turmoil. He thought: Struggling against selfishness is not just about shouting slogans; it is about listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting according to his instructions at all times and in all matters.

With this in mind, Bi Zuoxiang said to everyone, "The child's life is in danger, and the hospital is doing everything it can to save him. No matter what, I must act according to Mao Zedong Thought."

Bi Zuoxiang, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, said it and did it.

Bi Zuoxiang learned from his colleagues at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative that Wu Zhiping had begged for food with his mother before liberation, had experienced hardships, and was generally active in his work. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was one of the first to rise up and rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Bi Zuoxiang thought: Little Wu is my class brother; he is a comrade and fellow fighter striving for a common goal.

After learning about the child's condition, Little Wu and his colleagues from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative were very worried: What if the child doesn't make it? Little Wu had earnestly said to Bi Zuoxiang: "Uncle Bi, the responsibility for this lies entirely with me. If the child survives, please handle it as if he is alive; if he doesn't, please handle it as if he is not."

Bi Zuoxiang fully understood Little Wu's feelings and sincerely comforted him. Deep into the night, fearing that Little Wu might catch a cold, Bi Zuoxiang took off his own coat and draped it over him. Seeing that Little Wu was so worried that he couldn't eat, Bi Zuoxiang specially bought some cakes and insisted that he eat them. Little Wu stayed in the hospital all day, and Bi Zuoxiang, fearing that this would affect his work, repeatedly urged him to go back, emphasizing the importance of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

Bi Zuoxiang's words and deeds left a deep impression on the surrounding comrades. Xiao Gao, who was present at the time, said, "In the past, we often shouted slogans about learning from the PLA and paying tribute to the PLA, but we have never felt it as deeply as this time."

The night was already deep, but Bi Zuoxiang had not yet slept. He understood his wife Wang Guirong's feelings—she couldn't eat or sleep because the child had been injured. Now, he was thinking about how to further do her ideological work. Under the lamp, Bi Zuoxiang and his wife together reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant works, "Three Constantly Read Articles," learning them over and over again. Although Wang Guirong was not very literate, at this moment, she had established a firm belief in her mind: "Serve the people wholeheartedly." Chairman Mao's teachings opened her mind. She said, "I have also thought it through. I hope that Little Wu will listen to Chairman Mao's words in the future, follow Chairman Mao closely, and dedicate his life to the revolution, doing beneficial things for the people."

Despite the hospital's best efforts, Bi Zhanjun unfortunately passed away on the morning of October 21. Upon hearing the news, Little Wu and the leaders of the Pukou Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately rushed to the hospital. When he saw the deceased child, he couldn't help but throw himself onto Bi Zuoxiang, crying and saying, "I have wronged Uncle Bi, Aunt Bi, and more importantly, I have wronged my little brother. I am guilty..." Bi Zuoxiang, while supporting Little Wu's shoulders, repeatedly comforted him; he took the Mao Zedong badge from Bi Zhanjun's body and personally pinned it to Little Wu's chest, affectionately saying, "This Mao Zedong badge was Zhanjun's favorite when he was alive. Now, I give it to you. In the future, I hope you will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao closely, and dedicate your life to the revolution, forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." Little Wu was so moved that he cried uncontrollably. The comrades present also shed tears of emotion.

The leaders of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative could no longer hold back. They grabbed Bi Zuoxiang's hand and said, "Old Bi, say it, what punishment should we give to Little Wu?"

Bi Zuoxiang calmly and sincerely said, "Little Wu is my class brother. This incident is indeed serious, but as long as he can learn a good lesson from it and forever follow Chairman Mao, dedicating his life to the revolution, there is no need to give him any punishment."

The colleagues from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative were so moved that they couldn't speak. Wu Zhiping, tears streaming down his face, immediately expressed, "In the future, I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and follow Chairman Mao closely for a lifetime of revolution." Bi Zuoxiang heard this and was very happy. He felt that this was the greatest comfort to him.

Since then, Little Wu's spiritual outlook has changed greatly: He insists on studying Chairman Mao's works every night, writes study notes every day; he goes deep into the grassroots, seizes the revolution, and promotes production.

A long time has passed since the incident.

In Pukou, in Dadao Town, in the hospital, in the restaurant, in study classes, people are still constantly praising this loving deed towards the people.

    一曲闪耀毛泽东思想的爱民赞歌
    我们怀着激动的心情，向大家介绍某军事学院毕作祥同志以斗私批修为纲，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，正确处理孩子被撞死的感人事迹。
    事情发生在一九六七年十月十八日下午三时左右。
    南京浦口区供销社武治平和小高两位同志骑着自行车到驻宁某军事学院办事。他们一边走，一边讲话，当行至学院某俱乐部门前时，突然武治平的车子撞伤了正在那里游玩的九岁男孩毕战军。孩子当即昏迷过去。
    孩子的父亲毕作祥听到消息来到医院时，医院里正在紧张抢救。医生告诉他说：“孩子是外伤性窒息，肺部受到损伤，同时有严重的气管痉挛，由于撞击过猛，使血液倒流，引起脑水肿。刚才心跳停了七分多钟，看来可能救不活，即使救活了，也会带来严重的后遗症。”
    是从个人恩怨出发，还是按毛泽东思想办事。此刻，毕作祥脑子里展开了激烈的斗争。他想：斗私不光是在嘴上喊，而是要时时、处处、事事听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。
    想到这，毕作祥对大家说：“孩子的生命虽然危险，医院正在尽力抢救。不管怎样，我一定要按照毛泽东思想办事。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的毕作祥同志，这样说了，也这样做了。
    毕作祥从供销社同志那里了解到武治平解放前跟随母亲要过饭，受过苦，平时工作也比较积极，文化大革命以来，很早就起来造党内一小撮走资派的反。毕作祥认为：小武是自己的阶级兄弟，是为着一个共同目标而并肩战斗的同志和战友。
    知道孩子的伤势以后，小武和供销社的同志都非常担心：孩子万一救不活，那该怎么办呢？小武曾恳切地对毕作祥说：毕叔叔，这个事情责任全在我，祸是我闯的。孩子在，请毕叔叔按在的处理；如果不在，就请毕叔叔按不在的处理。”
    毕作祥完全理解小武的心情，便十分诚恳地安慰他。夜深了，老毕怕小武受凉，把自己的大衣脱下披在他的身上。眼看小武急得几顿吃不下饭，老毕特地买来几块蛋糕硬要他吃。小武整天守在医院里，老毕怕影响他的工作，三番五次劝他回去，一再说明抓革命促生产的重要。
    老毕的一言一行，给周围同志留下了深刻的印象。当时在场的小高说：“过去我们老喊向解放军学习，向解放军致敬，但从没象这次体会得这么深刻。”
    夜，已经深了，毕作祥还没有睡。他理解他爱人王桂英由于孩子被撞伤，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好的心情。现在，他考虑的是，如何进一步做好她的思想工作。灯下，毕作祥和爱人一起，重温了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，学了一遍又一遍。王桂英识字虽不多，但此时在她的头脑里已树立起这么一个信念：“毫不利己专门利人”。毛主席的教导打开了王桂英的心窍。她说：“我也想通了。希望小武今后好好听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命，为人民多做有益的事情。”
    经过医院多方抢救无效，毕战军不幸于十月二十一日晨死去了。小武和浦口供销社的领导同志听到这个消息后，立即赶到了医院。当他看到死去的孩子时，情不自禁地扑到毕作祥身上。一边哭，一边说：“我对不起毕叔叔、毕婶婶，更对不起小弟弟，我有罪……”毕作祥一面扶着小武的肩，一再安慰他；一面从毕战军身上取下毛主席像章，亲手挂到小武胸前，亲切地对小武说：“这枚毛主席像章，是战军活着时最喜欢的，现在送给你。今后，希望你一定要听毛主席的话，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”小武感动得哭泣不止。在场的同志，也都流下了热泪。
    供销社的领导同志，看到这里，再也忍不住了，一把拉住毕作祥的手：“老毕，你说，给小武什么处分吧？”
    毕作祥沉着而恳切地说：“小武是我的阶级兄弟。这件事本身是严重的，但只要他能很好地从中吸取教训，永远紧跟毛主席，干一辈子革命，可以不给他任何处分。”
    供销社的同志感动得说不出话来。武治平流着热泪当场表示：“今后，我一定更好地活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席，永远跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”毕作祥听了心里很高兴。他觉得，这是对他最大的安慰。
    从此以后，小武的精神面貌有了很大变化：每晚坚持学习毛主席著作，天天写学习笔记；深入基层，抓革命促生产。
    事情已经过去很长时间了。
    在浦口，在大厂镇，在医院，在饭店，在学习班，人们仍在不断传颂着这桩爱民的事迹。
