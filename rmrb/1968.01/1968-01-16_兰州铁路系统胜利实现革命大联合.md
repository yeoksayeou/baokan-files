In the resplendent year of 1968, just as it began, the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Lanzhou Railway System united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a glorious achievement of the revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway System in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

On the morning of the 13th, over ten thousand revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway and the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel of the People's Liberation Army braved temperatures below minus ten degrees to hold a grand rally, celebrating the revolutionary great unity achieved in the Lanzhou Railway System.

The meeting read out a congratulatory telegram from the State Council. As the telegram was being read, the entire crowd repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" They repeatedly sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Dear, But Chairman Mao Is Dearer."

The Lanzhou Railway Bureau administers all the main railway lines in the three provinces (autonomous regions) of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, bearing the extremely important transportation tasks of developing agriculture and industry in the northwestern region of the motherland and consolidating national defense. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway System played a crucial role and made great contributions. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the Lanzhou Railway System had a situation where the two revolutionary mass organizations were in long-term opposition. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, with the affectionate care of central comrades, and with the help of all sides, after "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and thorough consultation, the representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations reached an agreement on achieving revolutionary great unity in Beijing on the night of December 31st of last year. Before and after this, the railway sub-bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau, such as Xining, Yinchuan, Wuwei, and Yumen, achieved revolutionary great unity or reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great unity.

On the day the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Lanzhou Railway System reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary great unity, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received the revolutionary warriors. The representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Lanzhou Railway System were also received. When the celebratory meeting announced this heart-stirring great news again, the people once more became excited, shouting in unison, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The responsible comrades of the Lanzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the preparatory committee of the Gansu Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Dazhi, Xian Henghan, Li Shumao, and Hu Jizong, attended the meeting.

Li Shumao, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region and member of the provincial revolutionary committee preparatory group, spoke on behalf of the Lanzhou Military Region and the provincial revolutionary committee preparatory group at the meeting, warmly congratulating the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Lanzhou Railway System on achieving revolutionary great unity. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao received the representatives from Lanzhou Railway System who were in Beijing for consultations, this is the greatest honor for the broad revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway System. We must regard Chairman Mao's reception as the greatest motivation, model and seriously implement the agreement, implement the agreement, and achieve the agreement. He emphasized that implementing the agreement involves a lot of work, but the most important thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works actively, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. We must firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, always direct the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, in the common struggle against the enemy, enhance revolutionary feelings, eliminate estrangement, strengthen unity, and further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity from the organizational and ideological aspects. Li Shumao comrade urged the revolutionary railway workers to be highly vigilant, smash all the sabotage activities of the class enemies, seize the revolution and promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Lanzhou Railway System also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that achieving, consolidating, and developing revolutionary great unity is the common wish and demand of the broad revolutionary railway workers. The revolutionary railway workers must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all respects and thoroughly implement the five combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily in 1968. They expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, be infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit. They will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," learn from the People's Liberation Army, love the People's Liberation Army, actively help the People's Liberation Army do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. Better implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "seizing the revolution and promoting production, work, and preparedness," ensure smooth railway transportation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the meeting, the participants, holding high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and carrying the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," went to the Lanzhou Military Region and the Gansu Revolutionary Committee preparatory group to report the good news.

    坚决执行毛主席最新指示　打倒资产阶级小资产阶级派性
    兰州铁路系统胜利实现革命大联合
    国务院的贺电，极大地鼓舞了革命职工。他们决心更好地抓革命促生产，确保铁路运输畅通
    新华社兰州十五日电　在光辉灿烂的一九六八年刚刚开始的时候，兰州铁路系统的两派革命群众组织，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合起来了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是兰州铁路系统革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席最新指示的辉煌成果。
    十三日上午，兰州地区铁路革命职工和人民解放军“三支”“两军”人员一万多人，冒着零下十多度的严寒，隆重集会，热烈庆祝兰州铁路系统实现革命大联合。
    大会宣读了国务院发来的贺电。在宣读贺电过程中，全场群众一遍又一遍地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。
    兰州铁路局管辖着包括甘肃、宁夏、青海三省（自治区）在内的全部铁路干线，担负着祖国西北地区发展工农业生产、巩固国防的极其重要的运输任务。在无产阶级文化大革命中，兰州铁路系统广大革命职工发挥了重要作用，作出了巨大贡献。由于党内一小撮走资派的挑拨，兰州铁路系统曾出现两派革命群众组织长期对立的局面。在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，在中央负责同志的亲切关怀下，在各方面的帮助下，经过“斗私，批修”，充分协商，两派革命群众组织的代表，于去年十二月三十一日深夜，在北京达成了实现革命大联合的协议。在此前后，兰州铁路局管辖的西宁、银川、武威、玉门等铁路分局，实现了革命大联合或达成了实现革命大联合的协议。
    在兰州铁路系统两派革命群众组织达成实现革命大联合协议的当天，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，接见了革命战士，兰州铁路系统两派革命群众组织代表也受到接见。当庆祝大会上再次宣布这一振奋人心的大喜讯时，人们又一次欢腾起来，齐声高呼：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    中国人民解放军兰州部队和甘肃省革命委员会筹备小组的负责人张达志、冼恒汉、李书茂、胡继宗等参加了大会。
    兰州部队副司令员、省革筹小组成员李书茂同志代表兰州部队和省革筹小组在大会上讲话，热烈祝贺兰州铁路系统两派革命群众组织实现了革命大联合。他说，伟大领袖毛主席接见了兰州铁路系统在京协商代表，这是兰州铁路系统广大革命职工的最大光荣。我们要把毛主席的接见当作最大的动力，模范地、认真地执行协议，落实协议，实现协议。他强调指出，实现协议有好多工作要做，但最重要的是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，增强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。要牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资派。通过革命大批判和本单位斗、批、改，在共同对敌斗争中，增进革命感情，消除隔阂，增强团结，从组织上、思想上进一步巩固和发展革命大联合。李书茂同志要求革命的铁路职工，百倍提高警惕，粉碎一切阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，抓革命、促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    兰州铁路系统两派革命群众组织的代表，也在大会上发了言。他们一致指出，实现、巩固和发展革命大联合，是广大革命铁路职工的共同愿望和要求。革命铁路职工一定要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，落实《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论提出的五项战斗任务。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步巩固发展革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改。坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，学习人民解放军，热爱人民解放军，积极帮助人民解放军搞好“三支”“两军”工作。更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，确保铁路运输畅通无阻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    大会结束后，参加大会的人，高举伟大领袖毛主席画像，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，到兰州部队和甘肃省革筹小组报喜。
