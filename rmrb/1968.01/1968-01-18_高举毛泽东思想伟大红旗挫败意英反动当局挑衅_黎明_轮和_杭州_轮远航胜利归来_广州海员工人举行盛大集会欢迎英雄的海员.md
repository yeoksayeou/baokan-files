	Guangzhou seamen and workers held a grand rally to welcome the heroic seamen of the "Lingming" and "Hangzhou" ships, which had successfully completed their voyages and returned home after hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and defeating the provocations of the reactionary governments of Italy and Britain.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 17th - Today, seamen and workers from the Guangzhou region held a grand rally to warmly welcome the Chinese distant ocean cargo ships "Lingming" and "Hangzhou," which had successfully returned home after resolutely fighting against the reactionary governments of Italy and Britain to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Representatives of the crews of the "Lingming" and "Hangzhou" ships reported to their compatriots on the struggles they had undertaken against the reactionary governments of Italy and Britain. The Chinese distant ocean cargo ship "Lingming" arrived at the port of Genoa, Italy, on August 13th. The ship was adorned with quotations from Chairman Mao and banners reading "Salute to the Italian Working People!" and "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Italian Peoples!" The Italian authorities were terrified of the quotations from Chairman Mao and interfered without reason, demanding that the quotations be removed. The captain of the "Lingming" and the responsible person from the Chinese Commercial Representative Office in Italy immediately refuted the unreasonable demands of the Italian authorities, sternly pointing out that Chinese seamen studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought on their own ship is a sacred right of the Chinese seamen, and no one has the right to interfere for any reason. The Italian authorities, enraged and ashamed, ordered the Chinese Commercial Representative Office representative who boarded the ship to immediately leave the ship and demanded that the "Lingming" "leave the port immediately." These unreasonable demands were sternly rejected. After that, the Italian authorities dispatched a large number of armed military police to surround the "Lingming" by land and sea, cutting off all contact with the outside world, not allowing cargo operations, and restricting the freedom of movement of Liu Ruoming, the deputy representative of the Chinese Commercial Representative Office in Italy. They even adopted the fascist tactic of refusing to supply fresh water and food to the "Lingming," attempting to force the crew of the "Lingming" to surrender. The entire crew of the "Lingming" bravely and tenaciously fought against the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities and ultimately thoroughly smashed the Italian authorities' anti-China plot.

	The Chinese distant ocean cargo ship "Hangzhou" arrived in London on October 3rd according to the trade plan between China and Britain to load and unload cargo. The British authorities, using the excuse that the seamen who went ashore were wearing Chairman Mao badges, incited thugs to brutally beat up our seamen and carried out planned political provocations. After the incident, the British authorities instigated activities to "boycott" Chinese ships and dispatched a large number of police and plainclothes agents to surround and monitor the Chinese ships, restricting British workers from contacting Chinese seamen. At the same time, the British authorities frequently dispatched helicopters to fly low over the "Hangzhou," threatening and provoking. Under the resolute struggle of the entire crew of the "Hangzhou" and the repeated protests and warnings of the Chinese people, the provocative actions of British imperialism finally met with a shameful failure.

	Comrade Chen De, a responsible person of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, attended the welcoming rally and spoke at the meeting. Representatives of the Guangzhou Seamen and Workers Revolutionary United Committee, responsible persons of the Ministry of Communications' Distant Ocean Bureau, and responsible persons of the Guangzhou Distant Ocean Company also spoke at the meeting. They expressed enthusiastic praise and warm greetings to the heroic struggle of the crews of the "Lingming" and "Hangzhou" ships to propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

	Vasko Llopuria, the Albanian manager of the Guangzhou branch of the China-Albania Shipping Company, attended the welcoming rally. He expressed warm greetings to the entire crew of the "Lingming" and "Hangzhou" ships. He said: You are the heroic seamen trained and educated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The united strength of seven hundred million Chinese people is invincible. Victory belongs to the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗挫败意英反动当局挑衅
   “黎明”轮和“杭州”轮远航胜利归来
    广州海员工人举行盛大集会欢迎英雄的海员
    据新华社广州十七日电　广州地区的海员工人今天举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎为捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，同意大利、英国反动当局进行坚决斗争的中国远洋货轮“黎明”号和“杭州”号胜利归来。
      “黎明”号和“杭州”号的船员代表，分别在会上向祖国亲人报告了他们同意大利和英国的反动当局进行斗争的经过。中国远洋货轮“黎明”号于八月十三日抵达意大利的热那亚港，船上悬挂着毛主席语录和“向意大利劳动人民致敬！”“中国意大利人民友谊万岁！”等标语。意大利当局对毛主席语录怕得要命，横加干涉，竟无理要求摘掉语录。“黎明”号船长和中国驻意大利商务代表处负责人，当即驳斥了意大利当局的无理要求，严正指出：中国船员在自己的船上学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是中国船员的神圣权利，不容任何人以任何借口进行干涉。意大利当局恼羞成怒，悍然勒令登上船的我国商务代表处代表立即离船，要“黎明”号“立即离港”。这些无理要求被严正拒绝后，意大利当局竟调遣大批武装军警对“黎明”号进行水陆包围，切断它与外界的一切联系，不准进行装卸作业，并且限制中国驻意大利商务代表处副代表刘若明的行动自由，甚至采取拒绝向“黎明”号供应淡水和食物的法西斯手段，妄图迫使“黎明”号船员屈服。“黎明”号全体船员对意大利当局的法西斯暴行，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，终于彻底粉碎了意大利当局的反华阴谋。
    中国远洋货轮“杭州”号是按照中英两国贸易计划，于十月三日驶抵伦敦装卸货物的，英国当局借口上岸的船员身上佩戴毛主席像章，竟纵容暴徒对我船员进行野蛮殴打，有计划地进行政治挑衅。事件发生后，英国当局又策动“抵制”中国轮船的活动，并且派出大批警察和便衣特务包围和监视中国轮船，限制英国工人同中国船员接触。在这同时，英国当局还不断出动直升飞机在“杭州”号上空低飞盘旋，进行威胁和挑衅。在“杭州”号全体船员的坚决斗争和中国人民的一再抗议和警告下，英帝国主义的挑衅行径终于遭到了可耻的失败。
    广东省革命委员会筹备小组负责人陈德同志出席了欢迎大会，并在会上讲了话。广州海员工人革命大联合委员会的代表、交通部远洋局的负责人和广州远洋公司的负责人，也在大会上讲了话。他们对
  “黎明”号和“杭州”号船员为了宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想而进行的英勇斗争，表示热烈赞扬和亲切的慰问。
    中国阿尔巴尼亚轮船股份公司分公司阿方经理瓦斯科·留包里亚参加了欢迎大会，他对“黎明”号和
  “杭州”号的全体船员表示亲切的慰问。他说：你们是中国共产党和毛主席培养教育出来的英雄海员。七亿中国人民团结一致的力量是不可战胜的，胜利属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民。
