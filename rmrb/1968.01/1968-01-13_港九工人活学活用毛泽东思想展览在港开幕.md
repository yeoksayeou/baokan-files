The "Exhibition of Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers Studying and Applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought" recently opened here with great ceremony.

The exhibition vividly reflects the initial achievements of Hong Kong workers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle against British colonial rule and violence over the past half year. The more than 300 pictures and photographs on display show that after the outbreak of the anti-British struggle in May last year, Hong Kong workers broke through the enemy's white terror, carrying deep national hatred and class resentment, and with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, gradually launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

Since late October last year, various trade unions have organized groups to study Chairman Mao's works. Many workers participating in the strike have, in these study groups, taken "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as the basic curriculum, combined with the anti-British struggle, and through various forms such as reports, discussions, sharing sessions, singing quotations from Chairman Mao, and cultural performances, seriously studied and propagated Mao Zedong Thought. Many worker families have seen moving examples of parents and children studying Chairman Mao's works together.

The exhibition also introduces the deeds of model figures such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Mai Xiande, Nian Siwang, and Li Wenzhong in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The exhibition also has a display room for Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's badges, and Chairman Mao's quotation badges.

This exhibition is organized by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions. During the exhibition period, there will also be multiple study and application of Mao Zedong Thought sharing sessions and cultural performances.

In recent days, patriotic compatriots from various sectors in Hong Kong, including workers, students, fishermen, and farmers, have continuously visited the exhibition. They regard this exhibition as a classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. During the visit, the audience frequently cheered, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" as well as reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and singing revolutionary songs.

	Hong Kong electronics industry workers are collectively studying the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

    港九工人活学活用毛泽东思想展览在港开幕
    据新华社香港十二日电　“港九各业工人活学活用毛泽东思想展览”最近在这里隆重开幕。
    展览会生动地反映了香港工人半年多来在反英抗暴斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的初步成果。展出的三百多幅图画、照片等表明，去年五月反英抗暴斗争爆发后，香港工人冲破敌人的白色恐怖，带着深重的民族仇、阶级恨，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，逐步掀起一个在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
    从去年十月下旬开始，各工会普遍组织了学习毛主席著作小组。参加罢工的许多工人，在这些学习小组中以“老三篇”为基本课程，结合反英抗暴斗争，通过报告会、讨论会、讲用会、唱语录歌和文艺汇演等多种形式，认真学习和宣传毛泽东思想，许多工人家庭里出现了父母子女共同学习毛主席著作的动人事例。
    展览还介绍了雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、麦贤得、年四旺、李文忠等模范人物活学活用毛主席著作的事迹。展览还设有毛主席著作、毛主席像章、毛主席语录章的陈列室。
    这个展览会是由港九工会联合会主办的。展览会展出期间，还将举行多次活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会和文艺汇演。
    连日来，香港各界爱国同胞，包括工人、学生、渔民、农民，络绎不绝地前来参观。他们把这个展览当作活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。在参观过程中，观众中不时响起“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，以及朗读毛主席语录、高唱革命歌曲的声音。（附图片）
