Under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great helmsman Chairman Mao, warmly commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's great call to "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Over the past year, the broad cadres and soldiers of our army have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call. In the "three supports, two militaries" work, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary leftists. Using Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad leftist masses, together with the broad revolutionary masses, they have beaten the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev into a rout, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, promoted revolutionary great unity, revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units, making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In this great struggle, our army's movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a new stage. The broad cadres and soldiers have undergone tempering and testing in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and have produced a large number of advanced individuals and collectives represented by Comrade Li Wenzhong, the heroic Fourth Platoon, and the personnel of the 834th Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory. The ideological revolutionization of the troops has made a new leap.

Chairman Mao's great call to "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses" is an important part of Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a major strategic measure of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a new development of Chairman Mao's military thought.

Currently, to further implement Chairman Mao's great call, we must seriously implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. This is the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and doing the "three supports, two militaries" work better.

Supporting the left without supporting factions means to genuinely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and support the broad leftist masses. All revolutionary mass organizations should be supported. We cannot favor one faction and neglect another, support one and suppress another. We should not support everything just because "you are leftists and I will support you." Instead, we should support all their words and actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought. For some people's bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within them, we must not support it and must use Mao Zedong Thought to help them overcome and correct it. We should strive to promote the revolutionary great unity of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations on the basis of revolutionary principles.

Firmly implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, a handful of traitors, spies, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party, and class enemies in society, who are unwilling to face their doom, are using every means to incite and exploit reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to sow discord, attempting to split the proletarian revolutionary ranks, disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sabotage the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. This is a reflection of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the new situation. The great People's Liberation Army is the most important pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must clearly recognize the characteristics of the current class struggle situation, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and stand firmly and clearly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions and wage an uncompromising struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. This is an urgent need to unite the broad revolutionary masses, defeat the class enemies, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: We must firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that bad people are extremely few.

Firmly believing in the majority of the masses is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the basic starting point for supporting the left without supporting factions. We should firmly believe that after more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses have seen more clearly the anti-party and anti-socialist crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have pushed. Even some masses who were once deceived, the majority have awakened and stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must not ignore the awakening of the broad masses, fail to see the new developments in the mass movement, and fail to see that "the backward strata among the masses are striving to catch up with the advanced strata." We must not deny them entirely or exclude them from the revolutionary ranks just because some people have made temporary mistakes or because a few bad leaders have infiltrated a revolutionary organization.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a reactionary social trend. The broad cadres and soldiers fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" front must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, criticize and repudiate revisionism, strengthen ideological revolutionization, and resolutely resist this trend's influence. This is a fundamental issue in supporting the left without supporting factions. If we allow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to invade our minds and do not resist it, we will lead the "three supports, two militaries" work astray and will instead exacerbate the factionalism of some revolutionary mass organizations, deepen the opposition between the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations, damage military-civilian unity, and hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The People's Liberation Army is a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready people's army personally created and nurtured by the great helmsman Chairman Mao. In the new year, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts and actions of the support-left troops in each region, redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and advance courageously. If we discover any shortcomings or mistakes, we must correct them resolutely. Every cadre and soldier of the People's Liberation Army must further study Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strengthen proletarian party spirit, oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and be models of supporting the left without supporting factions. We must guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, smash the plots of domestic and foreign class enemies to sabotage military-civilian unity and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strengthen military-civilian unity. In seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new merits. (January 28)

    认真执行支左不支派的原则
    ——纪念伟大统帅毛主席号召“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”一周年
    在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，我们怀着对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，热烈纪念毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召一周年。一年来，我军广大指战员坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，在“三支”“两军”工作中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地站在革命左派一边，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众，同广大革命群众一起，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水，深入开展革命的大批判，促进了革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”和各单位的斗、批、改，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大贡献。
    在这个伟大的斗争中，我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到了一个新的阶段，广大指战员经受了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的锻炼和考验，涌现出以李文忠同志、英雄四排和八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员为代表的大量先进人物和先进集体，部队的思想革命化出现了一个新的飞跃。
    “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论的重要组成部分，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大战略措施，是毛主席建军思想的新发展。
    当前，进一步贯彻毛主席的这一伟大号召，就要认真执行支左不支派的原则。这是我军条条落实、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好的关键。
    支左不支派，就是要切切实实按照毛主席的教导，支持左派广大群众。凡是革命的群众组织，都要支持，不能亲一派，疏一派，支一派，压一派。也不能“你是左派我就什么都支持”，而是要支持他们的一切符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动。对他们中间一些人的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就决不能支持，就要用毛泽东思想帮助他们克服和纠正。要努力促进两派革命群众组织，在革命原则的基础上，实现革命的大联合。
    坚决执行支左不支派的原则，是在无产阶级文化大革命发展到现在的新形势下，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。
    在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的今天，混在内部的一小撮叛徒、特务，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和社会上的阶级敌人，不甘心他们的灭亡，正在千方百计地煽动和利用反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进行挑拨离间，妄图分裂无产阶级革命队伍，扰乱毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。这是在新形势下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的反映。伟大的人民解放军是无产阶级文化大革命的最重要的支柱。我们一定要认清当前阶级斗争形势的特点，提高革命警惕，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性进行不调和的斗争。这是团结广大革命群众，战胜阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的迫切需要。
    毛主席一再教导我们：要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数。
    坚定地相信群众的大多数，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心，是支左不支派的基本出发点。我们应该坚决相信，经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，广大群众对于党内最大的一小撮走资派的反党反社会主义罪行，对于他们推行的那条反革命修正主义路线，已经看得越来越清楚了。即使过去曾经受蒙蔽的某些群众，大多数也已经觉醒，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。我们决不能无视广大群众的觉悟，看不到群众运动的新发展，看不到“群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层”。决不能因为有些人犯了一时的错误，或者一个革命组织中混进了几个坏头头，就把他们全部否定，把他们排斥在革命队伍之外。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一种反动的社会思潮。战斗在“三支”“两军”前线的我军广大指战员，必须以毛主席的最新指示为纲，斗私批修，加强思想革命化，坚决抵制这种思潮的影响。这是支左不支派的一个根本问题。如果听任资产阶级、小资产阶级派性侵袭到我们头脑中来，不加抵制，那就会把“三支”“两军”工作引上邪路，并反过来助长某些革命群众组织派性的膨胀，加深两派革命群众组织的对立，损害军民之间的团结，妨碍毛主席的伟大战略部署的实现。
    人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和培育起来的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的人民军队。在新的一年中，我们要用毛泽东思想统一每个地区支左部队的思想和行动，鼓足干劲，力争上游，奋勇前进，发现了缺点、错误，就坚决改正。人民解放军的每个指战员，都要进一步学习毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，加强无产阶级党性，反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，做支左不支派的模范，努力把革命队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。要百倍提高革命警惕，粉碎国内外阶级敌人破坏军民团结、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，大力加强军民团结，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功。（一月二十八日）
