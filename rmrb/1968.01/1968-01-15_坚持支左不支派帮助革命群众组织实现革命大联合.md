Chairman Mao teaches us: “Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution, and it is also the primary question for the Cultural Revolution.” The great leader Chairman Mao has bestowed upon our army the glorious tasks of “three supports and two militaries.” The most fundamental aspect is to use Mao Zedong Thought to support and assist the broad leftist masses, unite the majority of the masses, unite the majority of the cadres, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and thoroughly defeat them.

During his inspection of North China, Central-South China, and East China, Chairman Mao made a series of extremely important instructions regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said: “Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under the principle of revolution.” Chairman Mao’s latest instructions are a heavy blow to the class enemies. The class enemies fear revolutionary mass unity the most because once the masses unite, they will be completely overthrown. Therefore, they use every means to sabotage revolutionary great unity, attempting to disrupt Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment. In this situation, our support-left forces must stand with the revolutionary mass organizations, follow Chairman Mao’s teachings of “first, be ruthless towards the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates,” correctly handle the two types of contradictions, closely watch the various tricks played by the class enemies, and resolutely prevent their plots to split the revolutionary factions, incite “civil wars” among mass organizations, and sabotage revolutionary great unity from succeeding.

In supporting-left work, we follow Chairman Mao’s teachings. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, we treat them equally, support their words and deeds that align with Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary struggle’s overall direction; at the same time, we enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao’s latest instructions to them, help them seek common ground while reserving differences, and gradually unite under the premise of a unified overall direction. Even if they cannot unite immediately, we strive to help ease the contradictions between the two sides, creating favorable conditions for future unity. The army only says things that benefit the unity of the two revolutionary mass organizations and does not say things that harm unity; only does things that benefit revolutionary great unity and does not do things that harm revolutionary great unity. If we favor one side and neglect the other, support one faction and suppress the other, it will inevitably deepen the contradictions between the two sides, making them more opposed. That would not be supporting the left but supporting factions, which would be deviating from Mao Zedong Thought and making a mistake.

Among our comrades, some say: “This faction is a good leftist faction, that faction is barely a leftist faction, a poor one.” Therefore, they advocate supporting this faction. Others say: “This leftist faction is hard to distinguish as genuine, that one is the real leftist faction.” Therefore, they advocate supporting that faction. Following Chairman Mao’s teachings, after conducting in-depth investigations and research, we believe that both revolutionary mass organizations have their own advantages. One faction has more issues in certain aspects, and the other has fewer. As long as the main trend of both factions is good, we cannot waver in our basic political stance. The different situations of the two revolutionary mass organizations are the specific basis for our supporting-left work and cannot be a reason for us to support one side and suppress the other. Even if one faction makes serious mistakes, as long as their problems have not crossed the line and have not undergone a qualitative change, we can only adopt an attitude of strengthening assistance, wholeheartedly helping them overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes, and cannot politically lean towards the other faction.

The great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao’s series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the highest principles for us to support revolutionary mass organizations in achieving revolutionary great unity. Among the two revolutionary mass organizations, regardless of which faction, we support actions that align with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and dissuade actions that do not. We firmly stand on the position of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely uphold the truth, and are not swayed by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. When doing so, we will encounter strong resistance from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. For example, some people, if you always praise them, they will be happy and say you are truly supporting the left; if you criticize their shortcomings and mistakes, disagree with their wrong views, they will say you are not truly supporting the left, are suppressing the masses, and are supporting the other faction against them. We resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, and resolutely oppose factionalism. Chairman Mao said: “A thorough materialist is fearless.” We follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, boldly praise the correct actions of the two revolutionary mass organizations, and boldly criticize the wrong ones, unafraid of temporarily existing some differing opinions with the leftist organizations. This way, it is beneficial to promote revolutionary great unity, making the two revolutionary mass organizations advance along Chairman Mao’s revolutionary path, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We have come to understand that to firmly stand on Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, achieve supporting the left without supporting factions, we must bravely break private interests and establish public interests. If “private” interests are not broken, supporting the left will be wrong. Supporting the left must involve fighting private interests; only by fighting private interests can we support the left. For matters that align with the overall direction and are beneficial to revolutionary great unity, if we hesitate due to some private thoughts, are indecisive, and do not clearly express our stance, we will disappoint Chairman Mao’s expectations and be derelict in our duty. For matters that do not align with the overall direction and are not beneficial to revolutionary great unity, if we support them due to some private thoughts, or tacitly approve, implicitly support, or even unprincipledly cheer, it will harm revolutionary great unity and be against Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought.

By acting according to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, guiding the two revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, we will temporarily encounter some misinterpretations and criticisms. Some say: “You are two-faced!” “You are compromisers, playing both sides!” Regarding such criticisms, we must stand firm and not waver in our resolve to support the left without supporting factions, actively guiding the two revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary great unity. What is being two-faced? It is to say one thing in front and do another behind, to say nice things to your face but play tricks behind your back. This is the behavior of a two-faced person. We use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, distinguish right from wrong, and are the same in front of both factions, the same in front and behind, firmly supporting the left without supporting factions. This is completely correct and is absolutely not being two-faced. As for guiding the two revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, this is not compromising or playing both sides; this is completely in line with Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. We firmly believe that as long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses in our supporting-left work, guide the two revolutionary mass organizations to act according to Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, we will definitely gain the trust and support of the broad revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao said: “Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.” We resolutely act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, persist in supporting the left without supporting factions, and resolutely promote revolutionary great unity.

    坚持支左不支派帮助革命群众组织实现革命大联合
    人民解放军七一○五部队政治部
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”伟大统帅毛主席赋予我军“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想支持和帮助左派广大群众，团结群众的大多数，团结干部的大多数，把斗争矛头始终对准党内一小撮走资派，并彻底战胜他们。
    毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时，对无产阶级文化大革命作了一系列极为重要的指示。他老人家说：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”毛主席的这一最新指示，是对阶级敌人的沉重打击。阶级敌人最害怕革命群众的大联合，因为群众联合起来，他们就要彻底垮台。因此，他们千方百计地破坏革命的大联合，企图打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署。在这种情况下，我们支左部队必须与革命群众组织在一起，遵照毛主席“第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结”的谆谆教导，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，密切注视阶级敌人玩弄的各种把戏，坚决不让他们分裂革命派、挑动群众组织之间打“内战”、破坏革命大联合的阴谋得逞。
    在支左工作中，遵循毛主席的教导，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，我们就同样看待，对他们符合毛泽东思想、符合革命斗争大方向的言行，就同样支持；同时，热情地向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示，帮助他们求大同，存小异，在大方向一致的前提下，逐步联合起来。即使一时联合不起来，也努力帮助缓和两派之间的矛盾，给下一步的联合创造有利条件。部队只说有利于两派革命群众组织团结的话，不说不利于团结的话，只做有利于革命大联合的事，不做不利于革命大联合的事。如果我们亲一方，疏一方，支持一派，压制一派，必然加深两派的矛盾，使两派更加对立。那就不是支了左，而是支了派，那就是背离毛泽东思想，就是犯错误。
    在我们同志中间，有的说：“这派是好左派，那派勉勉强强也算个左派，是个差劲的左派。”因而主张支持这一派。也有的说：“这个左派真假难分，那个才是真正的左派。”因而主张支持那一派。我们遵照毛主席的教导，进行深入的调查研究之后，认为两派革命群众组织，这派有这派的优点，那派有那派的优点，或者这派在支流方面的问题多一些，那派在支流方面的问题少一些。只要两派的主流都是好的，就不能动摇我们的基本政治态度。两派革命群众组织的不同情况，是我们进行支左工作的具体根据，绝不能成为我们支持一方、压制一方的理由。即使其中一派犯了严重错误，但只要他们的问题还没有过线，没有起质的变化，就只能采取加强帮助的态度，满腔热情地帮助他们克服缺点、纠正错误，而不能在政治上偏在另一派一边。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，是我们支持革命群众组织实现革命大联合的最高原则。在两派革命群众组织中，不管那一派，符合毛泽东思想、符合毛主席最新指示的言行就支持，不符合毛泽东思想、不符合毛主席最新指示的就劝阻。坚决站在毛泽东思想的立场上，勇敢地坚持真理，而不为资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性所左右。这样做的时候，会遇到资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的强烈反抗。如有的人，你一味地说他好，他就高兴，说你是真正支左的；你批评他的缺点错误，不同意他的错误观点，他就说你不是真支左，是打击群众，是支持另一派反对他。我们坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，按照毛主席的最新指示办事，坚定地相信群众的大多数，坚决反对派性。毛主席说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。我们遵照毛主席的教导，对两派革命群众组织的言行，对的就大胆赞扬，错的就大胆批评，不怕与左派组织暂时存在某些分歧意见。这样做，有利于促进革命的大联合，使两派革命群众组织沿着毛主席的革命轨道前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    我们体会到，要坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，做到支左不支派，就要勇敢地破私立公，“私”字不破，支左必错。支左必须斗私，斗私才能支左。对于符合大方向、有利于革命大联合的事，我们如果由于某种私心杂念，举棋不定，踌躇不前，不明确表态，就辜负了毛主席对我们的期望，就是失职。对于不符合大方向、不利于革命大联合的事，我们如果由于某种私心杂念，也去支持，或默认、变相支持，甚至无原则的捧场，那就会危害革命大联合，就是违背毛主席的革命路线，违背毛泽东思想。
    按照支左不支派的原则办事，引导两派革命群众组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实行革命大联合，也会暂时遇到一些曲解和责难。有人说：“你们是两面派！”“你们是折中主义、和稀泥！”对于这种责难，要顶得住，不能动摇支左不支派、积极引导两派革命群众组织实行革命大联合的决心。什么是两面派呢？阳奉阴违，口是心非，当面说得好听，背后又在捣鬼，这就是两面派的行为。我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，明辨是非，在两派面前一个样，当面背后一个样，坚持支左不支派，这完全是对的，根本不是什么两面派。至于引导两派革命群众组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实行革命大联合，这更不是什么折中主义、和稀泥，这是完全符合毛主席的最新指示的。我们坚信：只要我们在支左工作中用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，引导两派革命群众组织按照毛主席的最新指示办事，就一定会得到广大革命群众的信任和支持。
    毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，坚持支左不支派，坚决促进革命的大联合。　（新华社）
