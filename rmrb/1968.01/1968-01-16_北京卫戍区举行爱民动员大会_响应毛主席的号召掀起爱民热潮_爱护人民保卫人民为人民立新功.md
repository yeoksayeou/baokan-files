The Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison leadership and directly affiliated units held a love-the-people mobilization meeting on the evening of January 14. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers decided to enthusiastically respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," immediately launching a widespread, in-depth, and enthusiastic love-the-people campaign. In the year 1968, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve comprehensive victory, they will do an even better job of carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work and create new achievements for the people.

The meeting began with the officers and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "The army must blend with the people, so that the army appears in the eyes of the people as their own army. Such an army will be invincible in the world..."

"The army should solve the problem from the thoughts of every officer and soldier, making them thoroughly understand the importance of supporting the government and loving the people."

Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison, Zhong Huiqin, made a mobilization speech at the meeting. He urged all units in the garrison to take immediate action, further study and implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply understand the great strategic significance of Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the army and loving the people," and launch enthusiastic love-the-people activities. He said that Chairman Mao taught us: "This army is powerful because all those who join it have a conscious discipline; they are not for the interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the whole nation, to unite and fight. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." We should deeply study Chairman Mao's great teachings, further establish the worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, always stand with the masses, and always maintain the fish-water relationship between the army and the people, so that our army will always be invincible and continuously create new achievements for the people.

Zhong Huiqin said, we should take the 8341 Unit, the Hero Fourth Platoon, and the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Comrade Li Wenzhong as examples, resolutely support the broad revolutionary masses, enthusiastically help and love the broad revolutionary masses, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the people. We should vigorously help revolutionary mass organizations to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We should resolutely implement the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions," and arm the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We should actively send Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, vigorously propagate the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and vigorously propagate the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, so that the broad masses can see the great situation, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance courageously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Zhong Huiqin demanded that all units should focus on the grassroots love-the-people work, organize people's discipline inspection teams, go deep among the people to solicit opinions, humbly listen to criticisms, and seriously inspect the implementation of the Party's policies, the three disciplines and eight points for attention by the troops. If there are shortcomings or mistakes, they should be actively admitted to the people and corrected. A comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the love-the-people agreement should be carried out, promoting achievements, overcoming shortcomings, and solving existing problems. On this basis, further revise or formulate the love-the-people agreement of the unit, doing everything possible to care for, love, and protect the people. We should enhance revolutionary vigilance, strengthen class struggle awareness, and prevent class enemies from inciting conflicts between the army and the people, and destroying the unity between the army and the people. The meeting ended in a fervent atmosphere of slogans. The officers and soldiers present repeatedly shouted: "Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people'!" "Swearing to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great unity between the army and the people!"

Recently, the Beijing Garrison leadership issued a decision to carry out love-the-people activities to all subordinate units, districts, county people's armed forces departments, and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in the capital. The decision requires the broad ranks of officers and soldiers to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," and do a solid job of love-the-people work in various grassroots units. In factories, rural areas, schools, and neighborhoods, they should seriously propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses, vigorously hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented. This will promote, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in various units, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
