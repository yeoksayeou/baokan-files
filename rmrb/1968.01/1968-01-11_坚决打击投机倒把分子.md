Recently, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan's Qiaokou District have exposed a habitual speculator and profiteer. This individual, under the guise of purchasing and procuring various agricultural machinery items, went to Tianmen, Mianyang, Jianli, and Hanchuan counties to swindle money from production brigades. He would gather random parts, haphazardly assemble them into diesel engines, crushers, oil presses, and other machines, and sell them to production brigades at exorbitant prices, reaping huge profits. These machines were of poor quality and high cost, causing significant harm to agricultural production and the collective economy. He also used "orders" and "procurement" as pretexts to swindle large sums of cash from production brigades.

This speculator and profiteer was originally a embezzler. As early as 1958, he was sentenced to one year of labor reform for embezzlement. After his release, instead of engaging in honest labor and reforming himself, he continued to seek opportunities to engage in sabotage. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he continued to engage in sabotage and disruption. However, the revolutionary masses, tempered by the Cultural Revolution, have become more vigilant. As soon as the enemy shows its head, it is immediately exposed. The revolutionary masses have dealt a powerful blow to this scoundrel and several other habitual speculators and profiteers.

This incident further illustrates that "all reactionary forces, in their final moments, will struggle desperately." In the current favorable situation, we must maintain a high level of class struggle awareness and strengthen proletarian dictatorship. We must use the revolutionary broom to sweep clean all the social dregs hiding in the dark corners!

    坚决打击投机倒把分子
    最近，我们武汉硚口区的革命群众揪出了一个屡教不改的投机倒把分子。这个投机倒把分子以代修代购各种农业机械品为名，到天门、沔阳、监利、汉川等县去骗取生产队的钱。他随便搜罗一些零件，七拼八凑装配成什么柴油机、粉碎机、榨油机等等，卖给生产队，从中牟取暴利。这些机械质量低劣，价格昂贵，对农业生产和集体经济损害很大。他还以“订购”、“代购”为名，骗取生产队的大量现金。
    这个投机倒把分子原是个贪污犯，早在一九五八年就曾因贪污，被判处劳动改造一年。释放后，他不好好从事劳动生产，改造自己，而是继续寻找各种机会进行破坏活动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他仍然猖狂地进行破坏和捣乱。但是，经过文化大革命运动锻炼的革命群众，眼睛更亮了，只要敌人一露头，马上就揪住他。革命群众对这个坏蛋和其他几个投机倒把惯犯，给予了有力的打击。
    通过这件事，更进一步说明：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”在当前大好形势下，我们必须保持高度的阶级斗争观念，大力加强无产阶级专政。我们要用革命的铁扫帚，把那些隐藏在阴暗角落里的社会渣滓通通扫干净！
