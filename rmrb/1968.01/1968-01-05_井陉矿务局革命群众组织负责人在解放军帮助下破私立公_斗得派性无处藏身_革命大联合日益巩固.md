After achieving organizational unity in the revolutionary movement, how can we consolidate and develop this unity ideologically? The experience of the Jingxing Mining Bureau is: the leading core of the revolutionary mass organizations must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must thoroughly eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, raising the level of breaking private interests and establishing public interests to a new height.

The revolutionary masses of the Jingxing Mining Bureau, with the great assistance of the People's Liberation Army, achieved revolutionary unity throughout the bureau as early as last August. However, due to some comrades vying for leadership, positions, and power, there were signs of disunity in the bureau and the various mines' joint command departments. Some committee members in the bureau and the various mines' joint command departments were even preparing to pull out their forces and reestablish their "mountain strongholds." The PLA soldiers stationed at the mines analyzed this situation and acutely felt that unless the factionalism among the leaders is eliminated, revolutionary unity will not be consolidated. They enthusiastically organized the committee members of the bureau and the various mines' joint command departments to study Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and the brilliant works "Old Three Articles" using the method of small rectification. During the study, everyone used Chairman Mao's teachings as a mirror to examine themselves, openly expressed their thoughts, and fought against their selfishness.

After this study, the revolutionary unity in the Jingxing Mining Bureau was consolidated and developed. However, due to the failure to eradicate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, some committee members in the bureau and the various mines' joint command departments began to look down on, distrust, and suspect each other. Some committee members often had friction, affecting the further consolidation of revolutionary unity.

At this time, the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China regions arrived. The PLA comrades stationed at the mines immediately helped the joint command department to set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing the committee members to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They guided everyone to realize that: being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely following Chairman Mao's words, and unconditionally implementing every instruction from Chairman Mao, achieving learning and application together, and seeing immediate results, is the greatest public interest; studying Chairman Mao's instructions but not applying them, creating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, is the greatest private interest. This raised everyone's awareness of breaking private interests and establishing public interests to being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With heightened awareness, the self-awareness of breaking private interests and establishing public interests was also strengthened. The committee members made self-criticisms and had heart-to-heart talks to eliminate misunderstandings. Some even went deep into the masses, openly expressed their private interests and fought against them in front of the masses, and broadly sought the masses' opinions and accepted the masses' criticisms. The committee members' actions not only promoted their own ideological revolutionization but also inspired the broad revolutionary workers to fight against their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, establishing proletarian party spirit. In this way, revolutionary unity was further consolidated.

The PLA comrades realized from some facts that: the "private" character, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, cannot be eliminated all at once. Therefore, the PLA comrades helped them to study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, fundamentally raising their class consciousness. Additionally, they did the following: First, they mobilized everyone to thoroughly expose the manifestations of factionalism, discuss the harm of factionalism, and strengthen their hatred of factionalism; second, they constantly reminded everyone to maintain high vigilance against factionalism, never relaxing their fighting spirit, and to fight a protracted battle; third, they helped everyone to learn how to make self-criticisms, and as soon as factionalism shows its head, bravely expose it and fiercely fight against it. Under the help of the PLA, the committee members raised the level of breaking private interests and establishing public interests to a new height. A committee member from the Second Mine's joint command department discovered that after the great unity, he unknowingly got closer to the people from his original organization and less close to other workers, feeling that there was still factionalism deep in his soul. He then exposed this hard-to-discover "private" character, fiercely fighting against it. He deeply felt: "Factionalism is very cunning, sometimes hiding very cleverly. We must maintain high vigilance, always using Mao Zedong Thought as a microscope to discover it, fight against it, and make it have no place to hide, preventing it from causing trouble."

Under the help of the PLA comrades, the leading core of the Jingxing Mining Bureau and the various mines' joint command departments used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against the "private" character and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. As a result, a new situation emerged where everyone was closely united, respected each other, learned from each other, cooperated with each other, and worked together to grasp the revolution and promote production. Due to the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity ideologically, the bureau and the various mines respectively established revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs in October and November last year.

    井陉矿务局革命群众组织负责人在解放军帮助下破私立公
    斗得派性无处藏身  革命大联合日益巩固
    据新华社保定电　从组织上实现革命大联合以后，如何从思想上巩固和发展革命大联合？井陉矿务局的经验是：革命群众组织的领导核心必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，大灭特灭资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，把头头们的破私立公提高到一个新的水平。
    井陉矿务局的革命派，在人民解放军大力帮助下，早在去年八月初就实现了全局的革命大联合。但是由于有的同志争当领导核心、争席位、争权力，全局和各矿的联合指挥部都存在着不团结的现象。局和各矿联合指挥部中有的委员又准备拉出人马重立“山头”。驻矿的人民解放军指战员分析了这种情况，敏锐地感到：头头们的派性不打倒，革命大联合就不会巩固。于是，便热情地把局和各矿联合指挥部的委员们组织起来，帮助他们用小整风的方法，学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”等光辉著作。在学习中，大家以毛主席的教导为镜子来照自己，纷纷亮思想，斗私心。
    经过这次学习，井陉矿务局的革命大联合得到了巩固和发展。但是，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性没有根除，局和各矿联合指挥部中，在一些委员之间又出现了互相看不起，互相不信任，互相怀疑的苗头。有些委员之间常常出现一些磨擦，影响了革命大联合的进一步巩固。
    正在这时，我们伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示下来了。驻矿的解放军同志闻风而动，立即帮助联合指挥部开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织委员们认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，引导大家认识到：无限忠于毛主席，坚决听毛主席的话，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的每一个指示，做到学用结合，立竿见影，这就是最大的公；对毛主席的指示学了不用，闹资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就是最大的私。这就使大家自觉地把破私立公提高到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线上来。认识提高了，破私立公的自觉性也就增强了。委员们各自做了自我批评，并且互相促膝谈心，消除隔阂。有的还深入到群众中去，在群众中亮私斗私，并广泛征求群众意见，接受群众批评。委员们这一行动，不但促进了自己的思想革命化，而且带动广大革命职工纷纷斗自己的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，立无产阶级党性。这样，革命大联合进一步巩固了。
    解放军同志从一些事实中认识到：“私”字，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，不是一下子就能清除掉的。于是，解放军同志帮助他们大学毛主席著作，从根本上提高阶级觉悟。另外，还做了以下工作：一、发动大家大摆派性的表现形式，大论派性的危害，增强对派性的痛恨；二、不断提醒大家对派性要保持高度的警惕，务必不可松懈斗志，要打持久战；三、帮助大家学会做自我批评，发现派性一露头就大胆地亮，狠狠地斗。在解放军的帮助下，委员们把破私立公又提到一个新高度。二矿联合指挥部有个委员，发现在大联合以后，自己不知不觉地接近原来组织里的人多，对其他的工人接近的少，感到自己灵魂深处还残存着派性。于是，他便把这个不容易发现的“私”字亮出来，狠狠地斗。他深有感触地说：“派性这东西很狡猾，有时隐蔽得很巧妙，我们必须高度警惕，随时运用毛泽东思想这个显微镜来发现它，斗掉它，使它无处藏身，让它无法兴风作浪。”
    在解放军同志帮助下，井陉矿务局和各矿联合指挥部的领导核心，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的结果，出现了一个紧密团结，互相尊重，互相学习，互相协作，同心协力狠抓革命猛促生产的新局面。由于从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合，局和各矿分别在去年十月、十一月全部建立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构。
