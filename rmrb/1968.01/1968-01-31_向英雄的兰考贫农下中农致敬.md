The current situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas across the country is excellent. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been fully mobilized and are playing a leading role in the vigorous proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas.

"One must firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants." This is the correct policy and line set by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas. Whether or not one can firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants is the key to whether one can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry the rural cultural revolution through to the end. The history of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Lan Kao County, Henan Province, once again proves this point.

Firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, the proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas can proceed in the correct direction as indicated by Chairman Mao. In the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants were the most deeply exploited and oppressed. Every family has a history of blood and tears, and everyone has a record of suffering. They feel the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society most deeply, and they distinguish between the two roads of socialism and capitalism most clearly. They have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and they have deep class feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao. They resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and resolutely walk the socialist road. They detest and abhor the "exploitation is glorious," "three freedoms and one contract," and "four freedoms" advocated and promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. They clearly know who is on Chairman Mao's side and who is on the side of the bourgeoisie; who is good and who is bad. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong."

Firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, the proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas has a strong and reliable force. In the struggle against class enemies, the poor and lower-middle peasants have a firm stance and clear distinctions between love and hate. No matter how treacherous the waves, their red hearts to defend Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line never change. Our great leader Chairman Mao, when proving the revolutionary firmness of workers and the majority of laboring peasants, taught us:

"Some people have read some Marxist books and think they have knowledge, but they have not really read them and have not absorbed them in their minds, and they cannot apply them. Their class feelings are still old. There are also some people who are very proud, who have read a few sentences and think they are great, with their tails held high, but when they encounter storms, their stance is very different from that of workers and the majority of laboring peasants. The former wavers, the latter is firm, the former is ambiguous, the latter is clear." The intense class struggle in Lan Kao best illustrates: the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are how firm, how clear, and how fearless! It is they who, at the critical moment of the struggle, with their loyalty to Chairman Mao and the Party, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defend the iron-clad socialist mountains and rivers!

Firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants can ensure both revolutionary and production victories in the vast rural areas. The poor and lower-middle peasants not only care most about the proletarian cultural revolution but also care most about production. They are the true models of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, the revolution will be vigorous, production will be booming, and the countryside will be prosperous. The key to the excellent situation in Lan Kao County lies here.

To carry out the proletarian cultural revolution well, one must rely on those who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. In rural areas, one must firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants can one achieve comprehensive victory in the rural cultural revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

In praise of the heroic poor and lower-middle peasants of Lan Kao!

    向英雄的兰考贫农下中农致敬
    本报评论员
    目前，全国农村无产阶级文化大革命形势一派大好。广大贫农、下中农充分发动起来，在轰轰烈烈的农村无产阶级文化大革命中发挥主力军的作用。
      “必须坚定地依靠贫农、下中农”。这是毛主席和党中央规定的进行农村无产阶级文化大革命的正确方针、正确路线。能不能坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，这是能不能紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，将农村文化大革命进行到底的关键问题。河南省兰考县两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历程，再一次证明了这一点。
    坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，农村无产阶级文化大革命就能沿着毛主席指引的正确方向前进。在旧社会，贫农、下中农受剥削压迫最深，家家有血泪史，人人有苦难账。他们对旧社会的苦和新社会的甜感受最深，对社会主义和资本主义两条道路分得最清。他们无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱共产党，对我们伟大领袖毛主席怀着深厚的阶级感情。他们坚决听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路，对中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹和推行的那一套“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等等深恶痛绝。谁是毛主席司令部的人，谁是资产阶级司令部的人；谁是好人，谁是坏人，他们都有极明白的计算。正如毛主席所教导我们的：“他们的革命大方向始终没有错。”
    坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，在农村无产阶级文化大革命中就有了一支坚强可靠的力量。贫农、下中农在对阶级敌人的战斗中，立场坚定，爱憎分明。不管风浪多么险恶，他们保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一颗颗红心永远不变。我们的伟大领袖毛主席在论证工人和大多数劳动农民的革命坚定性的时候，曾经教导我们：
  “有些人读了一些马克思主义的书，自以为有学问了，但是并没有读进去，并没有在头脑里生根，不会应用，阶级感情还是旧的。还有一些人很骄傲，读了几句书，自以为了不起，尾巴翘到天上去了，可是一遇风浪，他们的立场，比起工人和大多数劳动农民来，就显得大不相同。前者动摇，后者坚定，前者暧昧，后者明朗。”兰考的这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，最好不过地说明了：用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫农、下中农是何等的坚定、明朗，何等英勇无畏！正是他们，在斗争的关键时刻，用自己对毛主席、对党的赤胆忠心，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，捍卫了社会主义的铁打江山！
    坚定不移地依靠贫农、下中农，就能够在广大农村保证革命和生产的双胜利。贫农、下中农不仅最关心无产阶级文化大革命，也最关心生产。他们是真正的抓革命，促生产的模范。坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，革命就会轰轰烈烈，生产就会热气腾腾，农村就会一片兴旺。兰考县的形势大好，根本之点就在这里。
    搞好无产阶级文化大革命，就要依靠那些决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。在农村，就要坚定地依靠贫农、下中农。只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地依靠贫农、下中农，才能从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取农村文化大革命的全面胜利！
    向英雄的兰考贫农、下中农致敬！
