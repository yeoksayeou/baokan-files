Inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a mass movement to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the focus on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is surging in the rural areas of Ningxia. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside, with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are actively participating in the study. They are pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Ningxia's rural areas to a new stage.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the rural areas of Ningxia responded immediately. They have established over 2,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 100,000 poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres participating in the study. Now, from the foothills of the Helan Mountains to the slopes of the Liupan Mountains, from the banks of the Yellow River to the pastoral grasslands, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held everywhere.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works has reached an unprecedented height. They say, "A thousand joys, ten thousand joys, studying Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest joy." Zhang Haibao, a 60-year-old poor peasant livestock keeper from Yonghong Commune in Qingtongxia County, eagerly signed up for the Mao Zedong Thought study class upon hearing about it. He said, "Though I am old, my heart is young. By studying Mao Zedong Thought well, I can better feed the livestock for the collective and contribute to the socialist revolution and construction." Lan Jinwu, a 67-year-old disabled war veteran who cannot get off his bed, also requested to participate in the study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside study Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions and implement them resolutely and swiftly. They ensure that every step they take follows Chairman Mao's teachings. They link their thoughts to their actual situations, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, and dare to expose their flaws, fight their selfishness without fear of pain, and change their selfishness without fear of difficulty. Many poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that "if 'selfishness' is not fought and eliminated, thoughts will rust; if 'selfishness' is not fought and overturned, the socialist cause will be difficult to defend." Some poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, recalling their lessons from standing on the wrong side in the struggle between the two lines, deeply realize that having the character of "selfishness" in one's mind will lead to an unstable stance and unclear direction in the struggle between the two lines, and the inability to distinguish between friends and enemies. Some rural cadres with the thought of wanting to change positions, through fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, realize that not wanting to be a cadre is mainly due to the "selfishness" in their minds. They say, being unwilling to be a cadre is like handing over the power to the class enemy. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, these grassroots cadres in the countryside, after raising their class consciousness, have replaced "fear" with "daring," and replaced "grievance" with "courage." They firmly declare that they will fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in their lives and die to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various rural areas of Ningxia closely combine fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism, linking it to the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside. They have launched a thorough criticism of China's Khrushchev. Various places universally adopt the method of studying one of Chairman Mao's instructions and criticizing one of China's Khrushchev's reactionary points, and based on the personal experiences of the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, they recall and compare, and denounce China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside have received profound education.

Through establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes and extensively carrying out the fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, the rural areas of Ningxia have seen a great situation in the cultural revolution of the proletariat. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to advance further, defeat "selfishness," criticize revisionism thoroughly, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the rural areas of Ningxia, turning Ningxia's rural areas into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下
    宁夏农村大办毛泽东思想学习班
    广大贫农、下中农和农村基层干部对毛主席的最新指示闻风而动，学了就用，狠斗私、猛批修，决心把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    据新华社银川七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，一个以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班的群众运动，正在宁夏农村蓬勃兴起。广大贫下中农和农村基层干部，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，积极参加学习，把宁夏农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召以后，宁夏各地农村广大贫下中农和基层干部闻风而动，大办毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，已开办了两千多个毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的贫下中农和农村干部达到十万多人。现在，从贺兰山下到六盘山麓，从黄河两岸到牧区草原，到处都在举办毛泽东思想学习班。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作的热情空前高涨。他们说：“千幸福，万幸福，学习毛泽东思想是最大的幸福。”青铜峡县永红公社六十多岁的贫农饲养员张海保，听到队上办毛泽东思想学习班，就积极报名参加。他说：“我人老心不老，学好毛泽东思想，才能为集体喂好牲口，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设立新功。”六十七岁的烈属兰金吾，腿瘫痪不能下炕，也要求参加学习。广大贫下中农和农村基层干部对毛主席著作和最新指示，学了就用，最坚决、最迅速地落实到行动中去，做到步步紧跟毛主席，一切行动不离毛主席的教导。他们联系自己的思想实际，斗私批修，做到亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，改私不怕难。许多贫下中农深有体会地说：“‘私’字斗不臭，思想就生锈；‘私’字斗不倒，社会主义江山就难保。”有些贫下中农和干部，联系自己在两条路线斗争中站错了队的教训，深刻地感到，头脑中有了“私”字，在路线斗争中就会立场不稳，方向不明，敌我不分。有些有换班思想的农村干部，通过斗私批修，认识到不愿当干部，主要是自己头脑中的“私”字作怪。他们说，贫下中农不愿当干部，就是向阶级敌人交印把子。通过毛主席最新指示的学习，这些农村基层干部的阶级觉悟提高以后，把“怕”字换成了“敢”字，以“勇气”代替了“怨气”，他们坚定地表示，生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    宁夏各地农村举办的毛泽东思想学习班，把斗私和批修紧密结合起来，联系农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，开展了对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判。各地普遍采用学习一条毛主席的指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动论点的方法，并根据贫下中农和农村基层干部亲身的经历，回忆对比，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论。通过革命大批判，广大贫下中农和农村基层干部受到了深刻的教育。
    通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，广泛开展斗私批修，宁夏农村无产阶级文化大革命出现了一片大好形势。广大贫下中农决心乘胜前进，斗倒“私”字，批臭修正主义，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在宁夏农村永远高高飘扬，把宁夏农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
