The left faction of the Japanese Communist Party has declared firm opposition to the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" in Sasebo, Japan. The people of Asia will surely punish the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The statement severely condemns the treacherous behavior of the Miyamoto faction in the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle.

	BEIJING, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- According to a report from the East Asia News Agency, the left faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee and the left faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Fukuoka Prefecture Committee have both issued statements firmly opposing the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" in the Japanese port of Sasebo.

	The left faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee stated that the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and other U.S. nuclear vessels in Japanese ports is a serious step by U.S. imperialism in collusion with the Sato government to intensify aggression, and a provocation against the people of Asia.

	The statement said that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries will surely face severe punishment from the people of Japan, China, Vietnam, and all of Asia.

	The statement also severely condemns the treacherous behavior of the Miyamoto revisionist faction in the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The statement said that all the disguises of the Miyamoto revisionist faction are aimed at covering up their anti-people, counter-revolutionary criminal activities.

	The statement concludes: "Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary people of the world resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, the reactionaries of various countries, and their followers. As long as the Japanese people strengthen their unity and join forces with the revolutionary people of the world, and persist in the struggle, victory will surely be ours."

	The left faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Fukuoka Prefecture Committee stated that U.S. imperialism, due to the blows it has received from the heroic people of Vietnam in their people's war, the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, and the heavy blows it has received from the people of Southeast Asian countries armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is in a predicament.

	The statement quoted Chairman Mao's wise judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and emphasized that the patriotic just struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people, with workers and peasants as the main force, will surely defeat U.S. imperialism and the traitorous reactionary Sato government.

	The statement also severely condemns the Miyamoto revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party, which verbally opposes the docking of U.S. nuclear vessels in Japanese ports but in reality attempts to make the people's anti-American struggle fail. The statement said, "We will resolutely expose and overthrow these revisionists as traitors to the nation and enemies of the people."

    亚洲人民必将严惩美日反动派
    声明严厉谴责宫本集团在日本人民反美爱国斗争中的背叛行为
    新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）和日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）分别发表声明，坚决反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”将到日本佐世保港停泊。
    日共山口县委员会（左派）的声明指出，美国核航空母舰“企业号”和其它美国核舰只到日本港口停泊，是美帝国主义勾结佐藤政府加紧侵略的一个严重步骤，是对亚洲人民的挑衅。
    声明说，美日反动派必将受到日本人民、中国人民、越南人民以及全亚洲人民的严厉惩罚。
    声明还严厉谴责日共宫本修正主义集团在日本人民的这一反美爱国斗争中的背叛行为。声明说，宫本修正主义集团的种种伪装，都是为了掩盖它的反人民、反革命的罪恶活动。
    声明最后说：“全世界的革命人民在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，坚决同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派及其追随者进行斗争。只要我们日本人民加强团结，同全世界的革命人民团结在一起，坚持斗争，胜利一定属于我们。”
    日共福冈县委员会（左派）的声明指出，美帝国主义由于受到英勇的越南人民的人民战争的打击，由于中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，以及遭受到用毛泽东思想武装起来的东南亚国家人民的沉重打击，而陷于困境。
    声明引用了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，并强调说，以工人、农民为主力的日本广大人民的爱国正义斗争，必将打败美帝国主义和佐藤卖国反动政府。
    声明还严厉谴责日共宫本修正主义集团口头上说反对美国核舰只到日本港口停泊，而实际上企图使人民的这一反美斗争失败。声明说，我们坚决把这些修正主义者当作民族的叛徒、人民的敌人揪出来打倒。
