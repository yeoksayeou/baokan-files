Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand, using flexible strategic and tactical maneuvers, have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy in the northern mountainous regions.

New China News Agency, January 19th: Bangkok News: The people's armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand is rapidly developing in the mountainous regions of various provinces in the north. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's armed forces, using flexible strategic and tactical maneuvers, have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy.

According to reports from Thai newspapers, recently, the people's armed forces active in the northern mountainous regions, on the basis of victory in anti-"encirclement" operations, have taken the initiative to launch continuous attacks, annihilating a batch of reactionary military and police forces. According to admissions from the Thai reactionary authorities, in the past month or so, the people's armed forces have annihilated more than fifty reactionary soldiers in ambush battles alone in the Nan Province region. On January 4th, the people's armed forces also shot down an enemy helicopter near Chiang Rai.

The people's armed forces have taken advantage of the complex terrain in the mountainous regions, fully demonstrating flexible strategic and tactical maneuvers. On December 7th of last year, the people's armed forces occupied a favorable position on the Lai Nan Mountain and bravely and intelligently counterattacked the reactionary military forces that came to "suppress." They killed four enemy soldiers. When the reactionary forces brought in reinforcements from the Third Military Region to attempt a strong assault on the mountain, they were ambushed again by the people's armed forces. Thus, the Thanon-Phapluek reactionary clique, in their anger, redeployed their forces to surround Lai Nan Mountain, using artillery and aircraft for indiscriminate bombing, but achieved no progress. On December 30th of last year, the people's armed forces took the initiative to launch an attack in the Wan Sok district.

After the flames of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle spread to the northern mountainous regions, the Thanon-Phapluek sellout clique dispatched large numbers of reactionary military, police, and "special forces" to carry out "suppression." They established a so-called "anti-communist command" in Chiang Rai Province and even brutally rounded up the Miao people living in the mountainous regions and imprisoned them in concentration camps. However, over the past few months, the people's armed forces have smashed the enemy's multiple "suppression" attempts and grown stronger with each battle. Their combat activities have expanded to Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Nan, Nan, Tak, and Phrae provinces, and the number of battles has significantly increased. The Thanon-Phapluek clique admitted on January 8th that the people's armed forces "have already controlled a mountainous region in Nan Province."

In the face of continuous defeats, the Thanon-Phapluek sellout clique recently held so-called "emergency meetings" and "special meetings," intensifying the deployment of suppression activities against the people's armed forces. The puppet prime minister Thanon even personally went to Chiang Mai Province to direct the battle. However, he had to admit that the reactionary military in the northeastern provinces "are in a state of emergency." The puppet deputy prime minister Phapluek also lamented, "Since the official anti-communist campaign began, the anti-communist work in Nan Province has been the most difficult," and "official losses have been the heaviest."

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下　运用机动灵活的战略战术
    泰共领导的人民武装在北部山区沉重打击敌人
    新华社十九日讯　曼谷消息：泰国共产党领导的人民武装斗争，正在北部各府的山区迅速发展。人民武装在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，运用机动灵活的战略战术，沉重地打击了敌人。
    据泰国报纸报道，最近，活跃在北部山区的人民武装，在反“围剿”胜利的基础上，连续主动出击，歼灭了一批反动军警。据泰国反动当局承认，在过去的一个多月中，人民武装仅在难府地区的伏击战中，就消灭反动军队五十多人。一月四日，人民武装在距清莱不远的地方，还击伤敌军的直升飞机一架。
    人民武装利用山区地形比较复杂的有利条件，充分施展了机动灵活的战略战术。去年十二月七日，人民武装占据莱难山有利地形，勇敢机智地反击前来“进剿”的反动军队，击毙敌人四名。当反动派从第三军区调来一支援军，妄图强攻山头时，又一次遭到人民武装伏击。于是，老羞成怒的他侬—巴博反动集团，重新部署兵力，包围莱难山，用大炮、飞机进行狂轰滥炸，结果却没有取得任何进展。去年十二月三十日，人民武装又在挽速干地区主动出击。
    泰国人民革命武装斗争的烽火，蔓延到北部山区之后，他侬—巴博卖国集团曾派遣大批反动军队、警察和“特种部队”进行“围剿”。他们在清莱府成立了所谓“剿共指挥部”，甚至野蛮地把住在山区的苗族人民抓来关在集中营里。但是，几个月来，人民武装粉碎了敌人的多次“围剿”，越战越强。他们的战斗活动，已经扩展到清迈、清莱、难、南邦、达、帕等府，战斗次数也显著增多了。他侬—巴博集团一月八日供认，人民武装“已经控制了难府的一个山区”。
    他侬—巴博卖国集团在节节失败的情况下，最近连续召开所谓“紧急会议”、“特别会议”，加紧部署对人民武装的镇压活动。傀儡总理他侬还亲自跑到清迈府督战。但是，他不得不承认，东北各府的反动军队“正处于危急状况”。傀儡副总理巴博也哀叹说：“自官方剿共以来，难府之剿共工作最为困难”，“官方损失最为惨重”。
