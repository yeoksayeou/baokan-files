The current era is the new era of the great thought of Mao Zedong. The boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the future of the revolutionary people of the world. The revolutionary people of the world share a common sentiment: they deeply love the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao; they share a common ideal: to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought; they share a common aspiration: to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary people of the world hold deep feelings of boundless love, boundless faith, boundless admiration, and boundless loyalty towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Over the past year, comrades, friends, and fellow revolutionaries from all over the world, with their deep love for Chairman Mao and their urgent desire to study Mao Zedong Thought, have crossed oceans and traversed mountains and rivers to come to Beijing, the center of the world revolution. They have visited and toured the People's Liberation Army in Beijing, which was personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, as well as other units. During their visits, they expressed their deepest emotions, most beautiful words, and most touching actions to convey their boundless love for Chairman Mao, their boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought, and their determination to follow Chairman Mao in revolution. They said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time!" "Chairman Mao is the most outstanding representative of the proletariat of our time, the red sun in our hearts!" "The person I admire most is Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the world's people!" "Chairman Mao is the unsetting sun!" "The revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao is the only path for the world's people to achieve complete liberation."

Long live Chairman Mao!

When foreign friends enter the camp of a certain unit of the Beijing Army, the first thing they see is the towering statue of the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao, standing proudly in the center of the camp's drill ground. Chairman Mao's mighty hand points forward, guiding the people of the world. On either side of the giant statue are two vivid oil paintings that vividly depict the world's revolutionary people's boundless love for Chairman Mao. Many foreign friends stood here for a long time, gazing at the statue, reluctant to leave.

Not long ago, Comrade Shehu and Comrade Aliya led the Albanian Party and Government delegation to visit and tour this unit. Comrade Shehu walked up to the giant statue of Chairman Mao, waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

A friend from Mali, upon seeing the statue of Chairman Mao, immediately paid his respects with the deepest reverence and then told the unit's responsible comrades accompanying the tour, "Chairman Mao is the teacher of the African people. We deeply love Chairman Mao!" Many foreign friends eagerly requested to have their photos taken in front of the statue of Chairman Mao and said, "Having a photo taken with Chairman Mao is our greatest happiness!"

A representative team from Southeast Asia, upon arriving in front of the statue of Chairman Mao, first collectively wished the great leader Chairman Mao a long life. Then they read aloud in Chinese the latest instructions from Chairman Mao: "Struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." "Do not rely on past merits, but strive for new achievements." "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Finally, they could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

During the tour, foreign friends also seized every opportunity to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao in the world revolution.

Last October, Comrade Ly Chi Vuong, a member of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and a soldier of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, just entered the camp and, with immense excitement, eagerly introduced to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army the scene of him seeing the great leader Chairman Mao on October 5. He said, "I saw Chairman Mao with my own eyes. Chairman Mao was radiant and full of vigor, and his health was excellent. We felt very happy and blessed. Chairman Mao is our common great leader!" Then he said with deep emotion, "All the people of South Vietnam have a common wish, which is to liberate the South as soon as possible and invite Chairman Mao and Chairman Hu to our South!"

Last September, the Japanese Gear Seat Troupe, led by Director Fujikawa Natsuko and flying the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, came to this unit for a visit. In the afternoon, they performed with the amateur performance team of the People's Liberation Army, singing in Chinese "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and dancing "There Is a Golden Sun in Beijing," fully expressing the love of the Japanese people and the people of the world for Chairman Mao. Before the performance, the actress Sohara Motoko excitedly said, "After coming to China, we began to learn dancing. We are not as skilled as everyone else, but to express our boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, we will still do our best and perform seriously for our comrades!"

A friend from Eritrea told the officers and soldiers of the unit accompanying the tour, "We knew about Chairman Mao Zedong in our country long ago. Our people love Chairman Mao just as you do."

The Burmese writer Yegong, representing nine African and Asian countries, said to the unit upon departure, "Although we come from different countries, we have a common leader—Chairman Mao; we have a common thought—Mao Zedong Thought; we have a common wish—to wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

The leader of a Vietnamese delegation excitedly told the comrades of the unit, "The works of Chairman Mao inspire the people of Vietnam to bravely fight in the war of resistance against America. Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no New China, and China would not have today's achievements. Without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggles of the world's people could not achieve victory."

The red sun illuminates the five continents.

"The East Is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong." The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the five continents and the hearts of the world's people. During the visits, foreign friends unanimously praised the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong Thought as "the truth and treasure of revolution." They expressed their determination to study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought for life to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army.

The boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of world revolution and the guiding light of world revolution. To make a revolution, one must master Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries from countries that are oppressed and enslaved have, in search of the truth of revolution—Mao Zedong Thought, overcome countless difficulties and come to China. A revolutionary from Ecuador said during the visit, "We Latin American people have been looking for the fundamental path of revolution and the truth to guide the revolution. This time I finally found it in China. This truth is Mao Zedong Thought. When we go back, we must tell the people that we have found the truth in China. We must strive to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought."

Last July, a foreign guest from Senegal said while having lunch with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, "The person I admire most in my heart is Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We believe most in Mao Zedong Thought!" He also said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth recognized by the revolutionary people of the world, and the guiding light on the path of progress for the people of Senegal. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought to ultimately achieve revolutionary victory!" A friend from Latin America read the first page and first paragraph of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at a meeting and said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the world proletariat, the guiding ideology of the people of Latin America and the people of the world."

A comrade from Thailand said in a discussion with the soldiers, "In our revolutionary struggles, we deeply feel that our people cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought for a single moment, just as we cannot do without food and air." He also expressed, "When we return to our country, we will actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought and arm the people of our country with Mao Zedong Thought to fight against American imperialism and its lackeys. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our country will definitely achieve complete liberation."

A friend from Uruguay said, "Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our task and our responsibility. Because Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, we Latin American people must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought!"

A friend from the Dominican Republic told the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, "We have learned a truth from bloody lessons: revolutionary struggles without Mao Zedong Thought will fail. Chairman Mao is our savior, and Mao Zedong Thought is our weapon of struggle." Then he told the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army that the reactionary government of the Dominican Republic is terrified of Mao Zedong Thought. Anyone returning from abroad is thoroughly searched, and Mao Zedong's works and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are not allowed to be brought in. Then he said, "I have thought of a good method (he pointed to his head) to print Mao Zedong Thought in the brain, so they can't confiscate it, and it's convenient to use. Therefore, I am working hard to memorize and remember in my brain the teachings of Chairman Mao on revolutionary struggles and use them in our revolutionary struggles when I return."

Following Chairman Mao means victory.

Revolutionary people from all over the world believe that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of mobilizing the masses to wage people's war is the only correct path for the oppressed people of the world to seek liberation. They say, "Only by advancing along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao can we achieve complete victory!"

A friend from Burma said in a discussion with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, "In our struggle for liberation, we are looking for a correct path. We have seen many philosophers go to Europe and America. But now we place our hopes in the East, in China, because China has Mao Zedong. The path of Mao Zedong is the only correct path. As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely achieve revolutionary victory."

A comrade from the Indonesian Communist Party said in a discussion about the Indonesian revolution, "Our Political Bureau has issued a self-criticism document to the entire party, explaining the mistakes we have made in the past. We have corrected the erroneous line and emphasized how to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. It can be said that the reason our party failed is that we deviated from Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental reason for our failure."

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This is an unshakable truth. This great thought has quickly armed the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are determined, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to smash the old world and build a new world. A comrade from Thailand said, "Chairman Mao often teaches us, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is a great truth. We do not listen to the 'good words' of American imperialism, nor do we listen to the fallacies of 'peaceful transition' from revisionism. We firmly listen to the words of Chairman Mao and follow the path of Chairman Mao, resolutely fighting against American imperialism and revisionism without yielding."

A friend from Argentina, upon concluding the visit to the unit, excitedly expressed, "We will forever be loyal to the great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao. We will forever maintain the great revolutionary spirit of communists serving the people. This has further strengthened our determination to follow the revolutionary path of Chairman Mao and has further inspired our confidence in victory. We must liberate the people of Argentina from the oppression of imperialism!"

"The slogan 'Follow Chairman Mao, overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!' expresses the firm confidence and iron will of the revolutionary people of various countries in the new era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought to advance along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Many comrades, through visits, saw that with the Chinese people and the invincible People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought as their strong backing, they repeatedly expressed their determination when leaving. A comrade from Mozambique said, 'Our guerrilla forces must take Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding ideology and Mao Zedong's military principles as the guiding principles of our guerrilla forces. We firmly believe that the Portuguese colonialists are paper tigers, and the revolution will definitely achieve final victory!' A friend from Palestine said, 'Chairman Mao said, 'Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again until victory.' This is said to us revolutionary people. I believe that no matter how great the difficulties the people of various countries encounter, as long as they act according to the teachings of Chairman Mao, they will definitely achieve victory in the end. The future is bright. Our country has a proverb: 'No matter how the dogs bark, they cannot stop us from walking the great road.' Let the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries bark all they want. As long as we advance along the great road of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no one can stop us!' Finally, he shouted loudly, 'Let American imperialism go to hell! Let Soviet revisionism go to hell! Let the reactionaries of various countries go to hell!'

    全世界革命人民同声歌唱红太阳
    当今的时代，是伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代。光焰无际的毛泽东思想，照亮了世界革命人民的前程和未来。全世界革命人民，有着一个共同的感情，无限热爱全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席；有着一个共同的理想，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来；有着一个共同的愿望，走毛主席指引的道路。世界革命人民对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线，怀着无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚感情。
    一年来，五洲四海的战友、同志和朋友，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和学习毛泽东思想的迫切愿望，远渡重洋，跨过千山万水，来到了世界革命的中心——北京，参观访问了毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军北京部队和其他部队。在参观中，他们用最真挚的感情，最美好的语言，最动人的行动，表达他们对毛主席无限热爱，对毛泽东思想无限信仰和决心跟着毛主席干革命的激动心情。他们说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的天才！”“毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的代表，是我们心中的红太阳！”“我心中最爱戴的人就是毛主席！”“毛主席是世界人民的伟大舵手！”“毛主席是不落的太阳！”“毛主席指引的革命航道，是全世界人民争取彻底解放的唯一道路。”
    祝毛主席万寿无疆
    外国朋友步入北京部队某部的军营，第一眼看到的，就是巍然屹立在军营操场正中央的全世界人民心中最红的红太阳毛主席的巨型塑像，毛主席擎天的巨手伸向前方，给全世界人民指明了航向。巨型塑像的前方两侧，耸立着两幅色彩明朗的油漆画，集中概括地显示了世界革命人民对毛主席的无限热爱。许多外国朋友走到这里，久久注目瞻仰，不愿离去。
    前不久，谢胡同志和阿利雅同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团来到这个部队参观访问。谢胡同志走到毛主席巨型塑像面前，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    一位来自马里的朋友迎面见到毛主席塑像，立刻以无比崇敬的心情向毛主席像致敬礼，然后对陪同参观的部队负责同志说：“毛主席是非洲人民的导师，我们非常热爱毛主席！”许多外国朋友纷纷要求在毛主席塑像前照像留念，并说：“在毛主席身边照像，是我们最大的幸福！”
    一个来自东南亚的代表团，走到毛主席塑像前时，首先集体祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！接着共同用中国话朗读毛主席的最新指示：“要斗私，批修”。“不要吃老本，要立新功”。“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”最后，他们情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在参观过程中，外国朋友还抓住一切机会，向解放军指战员表示自己对毛主席的无限热爱，热烈赞颂伟大领袖毛主席在世界革命中的丰功伟绩。
    去年十月，越南南方民族解放阵线代表团团员、越南南方解放军战士黎志愿同志，刚进军营，就怀着万分激动的心情，迫不及待地向解放军战士介绍了他十月五日见到伟大领袖毛主席的情景。他说：“我亲眼看到了毛主席。毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，身体非常好。我们感到十分高兴，无限幸福。毛主席是我们共同的伟大领袖！”接着他又深情地说：“我们越南南方人民都有一个共同的愿望，就是尽快解放南方，请毛主席和胡主席到我们南方去！”
    去年九月，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的日本齿轮座剧团在团长藤川夏子的率领下，来到这个部队参观。下午，他们和解放军战士业余演出队同台歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，用中文演唱了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和舞蹈《北京有个金太阳》等节目，充分表达了日本人民和全世界人民热爱毛主席的心声。演员佐原元子在报幕时激动地说：“到中国以后，我们才开始学习舞蹈，我们不象大家表演得那样精采，但是，为了表达我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，我们还是要尽最大努力，认真为同志们表演！”
    一位厄立特里亚朋友在参观中告诉陪同的部队干部和战士说：“我们在国内时早就知道了毛泽东主席，我们的人民和你们一样热爱毛主席。”
    缅甸作家叶贡代表九个亚非国家的外国朋友向部队告别时说：“尽管我们来自不同的国家，但是，我们有着一个共同的领袖——毛主席；有着一个共同的思想——毛泽东思想；有着一个共同的心愿——祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    越南一个代表团团长激动地对部队同志说：“毛主席著作鼓舞越南人民在抗美救国战争中勇敢战斗。没有毛主席的领导，没有毛泽东思想，就没有新中国，中国就不可能有今天的成就，没有毛泽东思想的指引，世界人民的革命斗争也不能取得胜利。”
    红太阳照亮五洲四海
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”。毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了五洲四海，照亮了世界人民的心坎。在参观访问中，外国朋友齐声赞扬毛泽东思想光焰无际，毛泽东思想威力无穷，毛泽东思想“是革命的真理和法宝。”他们纷纷向解放军指战员们表示自己终生学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的决心。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是世界革命的真理，是世界革命的指路明灯。要革命，必须掌握毛泽东思想。许多处于被压迫、被奴役地位国家的革命者，为了寻求革命的真理——毛泽东思想，历尽千山万水，突破重重困难，来到了中国。一位厄瓜多尔革命者在参观过程中说：“我们拉丁美洲人民过去一直在寻找革命的根本途径和指导革命的真理，这次我终于在中国找到了，这个真理就是毛泽东思想。我们回去以后，一定要告诉人们，我们在中国找到了真理，我们一定要努力学习和运用毛泽东思想。”
    去年七月，一位来自塞内加尔的外宾在和解放军战士一块吃午饭时说：“我心里爱戴的一个人就是毛主席！毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，我们最信仰毛泽东思想！”他又说：“毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是世界革命人民公认的真理，是我们塞内加尔人民前进道路上的指路明灯。必须用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能最后取得革命胜利！”一位来自拉丁美洲的朋友在座谈会上念了《毛主席语录》第一页第一段后说：“毛泽东思想是世界无产阶级的指导思想，是拉丁美洲人民、全世界人民的指导思想。”
    一位泰国的同志在和战士座谈中说：“我们在革命斗争的实践中深刻地体会到，我国人民一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想，就象不能离开粮食和空气一样。”他并且表示：“我们回国后，要积极地宣传毛泽东思想，把我国人民用毛泽东思想武装起来，对付美帝国主义及其走狗，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们的国家一定会得到彻底的解放。”
    一位乌拉圭朋友说：“宣传毛泽东思想是我们的任务，更是我们的责任。因为毛泽东思想是全世界人民进行革命斗争的最强大的思想武器，我们拉丁美洲人民一定要用毛泽东思想武装起来！”
    多米尼加朋友对解放军战士们说：“我们从血的教训中学到了一个真理：革命斗争离开了毛泽东思想就会失败。毛主席是我们的救命恩人，毛泽东思想是我们战斗的武器。”接着，他又告诉解放军指战员，多米尼加反动政府对毛泽东思想怕得要死，凡是从国外回去的人，都要全身搜遍，不许带毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》。然后他又说：“我现在想了个好方法，（他指着自己的头说）把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，他们就没收不了啦，使用也方便。因此，我正在把毛主席有关革命斗争的教导努力地背熟，记在脑子里，回去运用于我们的革命斗争中。”
    跟着毛主席就是胜利
    来自五洲四海的革命人民都认为：毛主席广泛发动群众进行人民战争的无产阶级革命路线，是世界被压迫人民争取解放的唯一正确的途径。他们说：“只有沿着毛主席革命路线前进，才能取得彻底胜利！”
    一位缅甸朋友在和解放军干部、战士举行的座谈会上说：“我们在争取解放的斗争中，要寻找一条正确的道路。我们看到很多哲学家跑到欧美。但我们现在把希望寄托在东方的中国，因为中国有毛泽东。毛泽东的道路就是唯一正确的道路。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装起来，我们就一定会取得革命的胜利。”
    印度尼西亚共产党的一位同志在座谈会上谈到印尼的革命时说：“我党政治局已向全党发出了一个自我批评的文件，说明了过去所犯的错误。我们纠正了错误路线，着重提出了怎样活学活用毛主席著作，决心走毛泽东的路。可以这样说：我们党所以失败，就是脱离了毛泽东思想，这就是失败的根本原因。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是一条千真万确、颠扑不破的真理。这一伟大思想，已经迅速地武装起了亚非拉各国的革命人民，他们决心在毛泽东思想指导下，砸烂旧世界，建立新世界。一位泰国同志说：“毛主席经常教导我们‘枪杆子里面出政权’。这是伟大的真理。我们既不听美帝国主义的
  ‘好话’，也不听修正主义‘和平过渡’的谬论，我们坚决听毛主席的话，走毛主席的路，坚决与美帝国主义和修正主义进行不屈不挠的斗争。”
    一位阿根廷朋友在部队参观访问结束时激动地表示：“我们要永远忠于伟大领袖、世界人民心中最红的红太阳毛主席。我们要永远保持共产党人为人民服务的伟大的革命精神，这就更加坚定了我们走毛主席革命道路的决心，更加鼓舞了我们的胜利信心。我们一定要把阿根廷人民从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来！”
    “跟着毛主席，打倒帝修反！”这句铿锵有力的誓言，表达了在以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代里，世界各国革命人民决心沿着毛主席革命路线前进的坚定信心和钢铁意志。许多同志通过参观访问，看到了有中国人民和用毛泽东思想武装起来的天下无敌的人民解放军作为他们的坚强后盾，临别时总是一再表示决心。莫三鼻给的一位同志说：“我们的游击队要以毛泽东思想为指导思想，以毛泽东军事原则作为我们游击队的指导原则。我们深信，葡萄牙殖民主义者也是纸老虎，革命一定能够取得最后胜利！”一位巴勒斯坦朋友说：“毛主席说：‘斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利’。这就是对我们革命人民说的。我相信，不管各国人民遇到多大困难，只要按照毛主席教导的那样去做，最后一定能够胜利。前途是光明的。我们国家有句俗话：‘任凭狗狂叫，不误走大道’，让帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派狂叫吧，只要我们沿着毛主席革命路线的大道前进，谁也阻挡不了我们！”最后，他大声高呼：“让美帝国主义见鬼去吧！让苏联修正主义见鬼去吧！让各国反动派见鬼去吧！”
