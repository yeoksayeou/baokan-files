The New Year's editorials in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* have outlined the battle tasks for 1968 for the entire nation. We are determined to follow the spirit of these editorials, to further expand and deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, to combine study with practice, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our factory.

Every victory in our factory's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has been the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. When a handful of capitalist roaders within the party created a white terror in the factory and launched a suppression campaign against the revolutionary masses, Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome a thousand hardships and ten thousand obstacles" guided and inspired the revolutionary masses to fight resolutely. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the factory achieved decisive victories, the revolutionary masses, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the supporting leftist troops, studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," corrected the incorrect attitudes of some comrades towards the deceived masses, carried out ideological and political work, and effectively helped the deceived masses quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions" was issued, the revolutionary masses immediately organized all the workers in the factory to study it seriously, to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism from their minds, and to achieve a revolutionary great alliance throughout the factory by system and by work group.

Some comrades had incorrect understandings about the liberation of cadres. The revolutionary masses promptly organized everyone to study the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," and to respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After the masses studied, they corrected their attitudes towards cadres; the cadres also made serious self-criticisms and gained the understanding of the masses. In this way, a large number of cadres stood up, and the factory achieved a revolutionary combination of the three elements, establishing the revolutionary committee.

After the revolutionary committee was established, there were many things waiting for us to do. However, we first focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastery is entirely for application," to rectify the academic style, and to launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the factory. Because we focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, we promoted the revolutionary transformation of the thoughts of all the workers in the factory, established a new revolutionary order, and thus, production rapidly increased. In December, we created the highest production level since the factory was established in 1958. The entire factory completed the 1967 national plan six days ahead of schedule.

In the new year, we will further improve the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, comprehensively implement them, and direct all our actions with Mao Zedong Thought. We will turn our factory into a vibrant Mao Zedong Thought school.

    用毛泽东思想指挥我们的一切行动
    杭州轴承厂革命委员会
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论，给全国人民指出了一九六八年的战斗任务。我们决心按照社论的精神，更加广泛和深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，活学活用，学用结合，夺取我厂无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    一年多来我厂无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。在厂里党内一小撮走资派制造白色恐怖，围剿无产阶级革命派的时候，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，指引和鼓舞着无产阶级革命派去进行坚决斗争。厂里的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性的胜利后，无产阶级革命派又在支左部队驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，纠正了少数同志对受蒙蔽群众的不正确态度，开展了思想政治工作，有力地促进了受蒙蔽群众迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示传来后，无产阶级革命派立即组织全厂职工认真学习，从思想上扫除资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，实现了按系统、按班组的全厂的革命大联合。
    有一部分同志在解放干部问题上存在着不正确的认识，无产阶级革命派又及时地组织大家学习了伟大领袖毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的最新指示，并且响应林副主席的号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班。群众学习以后，端正了对待干部的态度；干部也认真地作了自我批评，得到了群众的谅解。这样，一大批干部站了出来，全厂实现了革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。
    革命委员会成立后，有许多事情等着我们去做。但是，我们首先抓的是活学活用毛主席著作。我们遵照毛主席的“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用”的教导，整顿学风，在全厂掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。由于我们大抓了毛主席著作的学习，促进全厂职工的思想革命化，建立了革命的新秩序，因而，生产迅速上升，去年十二月份创造了一九五八年建厂以来的最高生产水平。全厂提前六天完成了一九六七年度国家计划。
    在新的一年里，我们要进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班，对毛主席的最新指示坚决做到条条落实，全面落实，用毛泽东思想指挥我们的一切行动，把我厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
