The nation's broad masses of soldiers and civilians are greatly inspired by the news of the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are beating the drums louder and louder to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. They are accelerating their steps to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, amid the clarion call to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, joyous news has come from Gansu Province, a key strategic location in the northwest of the motherland and one of the frontlines in the struggle against revisionism: the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory! The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation warmly acclaim the spring breeze blowing to the Jade Gate Pass and warmly congratulate the birth of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary three-in-one combination in Gansu Province. They enthusiastically shout in thousands and ten thousands of voices: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times, ten thousand times! Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution!

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat throughout the country is excellent, not just fairly good. The overall situation is better than at any time in the past." The birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again proves the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's great instructions and wise foresight. Revolutionary masses across the country are greatly inspired by the victory news of the Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province. They have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the heroic proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu Province, ride the wind of the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation across the country, beat the drums louder and louder to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, accelerate the steps to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly smash factionalism, strengthen party spirit, implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions comprehensively, redouble their efforts, strive to be the best, and resolutely carry out the various combat tasks for 1968 proposed by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. They will seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

From the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains to the shores of the Bohai Sea, from the banks of the Yalu River to the foothills of the Himalayas, many places' revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, revolutionary mass organizations, and broad revolutionary masses held discussions and celebration activities today to celebrate the glorious birth of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The revolutionary committees and revolutionary committee preparatory groups of Beijing, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Ningxia, Guangdong, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions sent congratulatory telegrams to the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. In its congratulatory telegram, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee praised the proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu Province for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought over the past year, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with the great help of the People's Liberation Army, fighting with great revolutionary spirit and unyielding struggle, defeating the likes of Wang Sheng, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Gansu Province, and seizing back the power usurped by Wang Sheng and other handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They have established outstanding merits for the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary workers from the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi, attending the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Workers' Congress, said excitedly in a discussion: A year ago, the "thunder of the southwest" resounded through the clouds over the Guizhou Plateau, and the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born; today, the joyous news of Mao Zedong Thought's victory march comes from the northwest plateau—the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee is born. We are determined to learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu, stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, and forever unite and fight together.

The 2,400 representatives attending the Tianjin Municipal Mao Zedong Thought Study Class Experience Exchange Conference sent a congratulatory telegram to the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, saying that the revolutionary youth of Tianjin responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, supported the construction of the interior and border areas, and many have settled in Gansu.

They expressed their determination to, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further launch a new high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the city, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

We will further, together with the broad revolutionary masses of Gansu Province, seriously learn from and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary masses of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, upon hearing this joyous news, spread the word. Revolutionary youngsters of the Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class jointly run by the two factions at Xinjiang University said happily, "The spring breeze has reached the Jade Gate Pass, and tomorrow the flowers will bloom on the Tian Shan Mountains."
