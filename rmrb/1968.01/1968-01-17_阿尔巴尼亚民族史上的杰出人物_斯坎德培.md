1968 is a year of great significance for Albania. January 17, 1968, marks the 500th anniversary of the death of the glorious national hero George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. According to a decision by the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, this year has been declared a year of grand celebration in honor of this national hero.

The national hero George Kastrioti Skanderbeg is a great figure from the most critical period in Albanian national history and holds a distinguished position in the world.

Skanderbeg lived and worked during a historical period that Engels once astutely referred to as a decisive era in European history. During this period, social changes and signs of a crisis in feudal rule emerged. By its end, some centralized modern nation-states had formed, and cities with advanced economic and social structures flourished.

Based on research into Albanian history, we can confidently assert: despite certain opposing factors that played a role, Albania contributed to the economic, social, and cultural development of this period and kept pace with the neighboring countries of the Adriatic-Balkan basin. However, it was at this historic moment that the Ottoman invaders rose to power, their invasions not only spreading across the entire Balkan Peninsula but also reaching Central and Western Europe. The issue, however, is that this was not a mere sporadic and accidental action but a series of planned, frenzied, and destructive invasions. It began in the late 14th century, and a century later, the Ottoman invaders had entered Albania and crossed the Balkans to Italy, Yugoslavia, and Austria.

The reason Albania, the land of the eagle, was an unyielding stronghold against Ottoman invaders, and the last country to be occupied by them, is primarily due to the struggles of the people, especially the brave peasantry who fought against the invaders. Their heroic resistance will forever be recorded in history. Even the historians of the Ottoman Empire at that time had to acknowledge this fact. For example, Dulcarnain Bey once bitterly remarked, "The Albanian army is born to resist and vent its anger; it never kneels or retreats..." Another historian, drawing from long-term experience, concluded, "This is a remarkable nation that wishes to live in peace with good people... but will fight tooth and nail against those who wield the sword."

It was precisely because of the people's factor that George Kastrioti Skanderbeg was able to fight victoriously for twenty-five years (1443-1468) against the mighty forces of Sultan Mehmed II and his son Muhammad II with extremely limited resources.

Skanderbeg understood and realized the national demands, which were to defend life, territory, and freedom and to resist the invaders. This statesman and far-sighted political organizer also clearly understood the objective historical requirements of the time. Half a century of experience had shown that without the unification of national political, military, and economic forces, it was difficult to resist the enemy's powerful army. Under these circumstances, the League of Lezhë was established in 1444, the highest command body for directing the struggle. Skanderbeg, as the founder and "commander," timely counteracted, to some extent, the centrifugal tendencies of the Albanian feudal lords. For this purpose, he even resorted to force against his closest associates. This was a step towards the unity of the Albanian people and national unification, opposing feudal fragmentation. Before this, the socio-economic development of the entire country had prepared the conditions for this unity, and Skanderbeg, utilizing the needs of the war, accelerated this unification process.

The Ottoman Empire's invasion of Albania was not merely to occupy the Balkan Peninsula. Those with foresight could clearly see that Mehmed II's goal was to use Albania as a springboard to attack Italy and Hungary. Later, after the final fall of this bridgehead of Albania, Mehmed II and his son Bayezid II did just that. At that time, it was also clear that the struggle of the Albanians locally tied down the Ottoman Empire's important troops and blocked their path to Italy, preventing the Ottoman army from advancing to new battlefields. Some far-sighted politicians, such as Skanderbeg and Sinan Pasha, proposed joint action to save the common danger. However, due to the shortsighted and selfish policies of some Western European countries, this demand was not realized. Although Skanderbeg had to fight alone, he and the people were very clear that they were fighting for the common cause of the peoples of all countries. He believed this and frankly told an Italian prince who did not sufficiently respect the Albanian people, proudly pointing out to this prince, "You should understand that if the Ottoman Empire ultimately defeats us, it will be a case of 'when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold'; the land that you boast of as belonging to you, Italy, will also fall into the hands of the Ottomans..." At that time, the most far-sighted people also pointed out that the Albanian people, at the most dangerous moment, made a contribution to European culture.

From a historical perspective, the war that Skanderbeg waged was not a war of a leader, no matter how great his genius. This war had gone beyond the narrow scope of a small group of nobles trying to maintain their wealth. This war strongly defended the interests of the masses. Every victory it achieved was a victory over feudal fragmentation, localism, and the policy of selling out the country. Its famous achievements were not only due to the great strategic and tactical thinking of the war commander but also came from the wisdom of tens of thousands of unnamed soldiers who brought to this war the experience and methods of people's warfare over a thousand years.

The war failed. Ten years after Skanderbeg's death, the last fortresses of Krujë, Lezhë, and Shkodër fell. However, the people in the mountains continued to resist. The great tradition of the war and the spirit of the period led by Skanderbeg never died out and could never die out in the hearts of the Albanian people who had nurtured Skanderbeg. The name Skanderbeg not only became a banner for freedom in the hearts of the Albanian people but also in the hearts of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and other countries: the banner of Skanderbeg's struggle. As our great poet Naim Frashëri said, this is a "blood-stained banner of struggle," a "banner of the poor people." It has guided the Albanian people through difficult yet glorious years. This banner, from the independence of Vlorë on November 28 to the National Liberation War, has been passed on to the iron-clad hands of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Albanian Labor Party), leading the Albanian people to new great victories.

This is why the name of Skanderbeg and the Albanian people will be forever remembered in history. The name and example of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg will forever remain in the hearts of the people fighting for freedom.

The great example of the forefathers of the 15th century is full of lessons for their descendants. Their descendants, surrounded by enemies, are fighting victoriously for socialism and engaging in fierce struggles against imperialism and modern revisionism. But they are proud because, like Skanderbeg, they believe in their own strength.

    阿尔巴尼亚民族史上的杰出人物—斯坎德培
    一九六八年对阿尔巴尼亚来说，有一件意义重大的事情。一九六八年一月十七日是光荣的民族英雄乔治·康斯坦丁·斯坎德培逝世五百周年。根据阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议的决定，今年被宣布为纪念这位民族英雄的大庆年。
    民族英雄乔治·康斯坦丁·斯坎德培是阿尔巴尼亚民族史上最关键时期的伟大形象，并且在世界上也占有卓越的地位。
    斯坎德培生活和工作的那段历史时期，是恩格斯曾精辟地称之为欧洲历史上的决定性时期。在这一段时期里，出现了社会的变革及封建统治危机的征兆。到了它的末期，一些集中的近代民族国家形成了，具有先进经济和社会结构的城市繁荣起来了。
    根据对阿尔巴尼亚历史的研究，我们有权肯定：尽管有某些对抗的因素起过抵制作用，但是阿尔巴尼亚对这一时期的经济、社会及文化的发展作出了自己的贡献，并和亚得里亚—巴尔干盆地的邻国并驾齐驱。而奥斯曼帝国侵略者正崛起于这一历史性的时刻，他们的侵略不但伸展到整个巴尔干半岛，而且也蔓延到中欧和西欧。但问题在于这并不仅是一次持续和偶然的行动，而是一系列有计划的、疯狂的和破坏性的侵略。它开始于十四世纪末叶，一个世纪之后，奥斯曼侵略者就侵入阿尔巴尼亚，并越过了巴尔干直至意大利、南斯拉夫和奥地利。
    阿尔巴尼亚之所以是一块奥斯曼入侵者啃不动的硬骨头，这个山鹰之国之所以是最后一个被侵略者侵占的国家，那首先要归功于人民群众的斗争，特别是要归功于英勇抗击侵略者的农民，他们的英勇斗争将永垂史册。就是奥斯曼帝国当时的历史学家，也不得不承认这个史实。如：杜勒森·佩耶就曾咬牙切齿地说：“阿尔巴尼亚军队生来就是为了抵抗、发泄他的愤怒，他从不屈膝退让……”；另一个历史学家从长期的经验里得出结论是：“这是一个了不起的民族，他愿和善良的人们和平相处……，但是对那些挥舞大刀的人则进行针锋相对的斗争。”
    正是由于人民的因素，才使得乔治·康斯坦丁·斯坎德培能不断地、以极有限的力量同苏丹穆哈德二世和他的儿子穆罕默德二世的雄厚兵力胜利地进行斗争达二十五年之久（一四四三——一四六八）。
    斯坎德培了解并实现了民族的要求，那就是：保卫生命、国土和自由以及抗击入侵者。这位国家元首和有见识的政治组织者，同样也很清楚当时的客观历史要求。半个世纪来的经验已告诉人们，没有全国的政治、军事和经济诸力量的联合，是难以抵挡敌人的强大兵力的。在这种情况下，一四四四年建立了列希联盟，即指挥战斗的最高机构。斯坎德培作为创始人和“统帅”，及时地在某些程度上抵销了阿尔巴尼亚封建贵族的离心倾向。为了这一点，他甚至不惜使用武力反对他最亲密的人。这是反对封建割据、走向阿尔巴尼亚人民团结和国家统一的一步。在这以前，整个国家的社会经济的发展已为这个联合准备了条件，斯坎德培利用战争的需要，加速了这个联合的进程。
    奥斯曼帝国侵入阿尔巴尼亚并不只是为了占领巴尔干半岛。有见识的人完全能看到，穆罕默德二世的目的是把阿尔巴尼亚作为跳板，通过它来进攻意大利和匈牙利。后来，当阿尔巴尼亚这座桥头堡最后陷落以后，穆罕默德二世和他的儿子巴雅泽德二世就是这样做的。当时，人们也很清楚地看到，阿尔巴尼亚人的斗争在当地牵制了奥斯曼帝国的重要部队，并阻挡了他们通向意大利的道路，阻拦奥斯曼帝国军队开向新的战线。一些英明的政治家，如斯坎德培、希尼亚德等人，曾提出以联合作战来挽救共同的危险。但由于西欧一些国家的盲动和利己主义的政策，这一要求未能得到实现。尽管斯坎德培不得不单独战斗，但他本人和人民都很清楚，他们是为了各国人民的共同事业而战。他深信这一点，并把这个信念坦率地告诉了一位对阿尔巴尼亚人民不够尊重的意大利王子，他自豪地向这个王子指出：“你们应当明白，如果奥斯曼帝国最后把我们打败，则将是唇亡齿寒，一直夸为属于您的意大利国土，也将沦落于奥斯曼人的手中……”当时最有远见的人们也曾指出过，阿尔巴尼亚人民在最危险的时刻对欧洲文化作出了贡献。
    从历史背景来看问题，斯坎德培所进行的这场战争并不是一个领袖的战争，不论他有多大的天才，这场战争已超出一小撮贵族试图维护自己财富的狭小范畴。这场战争坚强地保卫了人民大众的利益。它所取得的每一个胜利都是一次战胜封建割据及其地方主义和卖国政策的胜利。它那赫赫有名的战果，不仅是由于战争指挥者的伟大战略和战术思想，而且来自于成千上万不出名的战士的智慧，他们给这场战争带来了千年来人民作战的经验和方法。
    战争失败了。斯坎德培死后十年，最后几个要塞克鲁亚、累日阿和斯库台失守了。但是，山区的人民仍坚持了下来。伟大战争的传统，斯坎德培领导时期的精神，从来就没有熄灭，也不可能在孕育过斯坎德培的阿尔巴尼亚人民心中熄灭。斯坎德培这一名字不仅成了阿尔巴尼亚人民心中，而且也成了巴尔干半岛人民和其他国家人民心中的一面为自由而战的鲜明旗帜：斯坎德培战斗的旗帜。正如我们伟大的诗人范·斯·诺利所说：这是一面“浴血战斗的旗帜”，是“穷苦人民的旗帜”。它一直指引阿尔巴尼亚人民走过了艰难而又光荣的岁月。这面旗帜从十一月二十八日发罗拉独立到民族解放战争，一直传到阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现在的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党）的钢铁般的巨手中，引导阿尔巴尼亚人民走向新的伟大胜利。
    这就是为什么斯坎德培和阿尔巴尼亚人民的名字将永垂史册。阿尔巴尼亚民族英雄斯坎德培的名字和他的榜样，将永远留在为争取自由的人民的心中。
    十五世纪前辈们的伟大榜样，对他们的子孙后代是充满教益的。他们的子孙在敌人的包围下胜利地为社会主义而奋斗，并同帝国主义和现代修正主义展开激烈的搏斗。但他们却很自豪，因为，同斯坎德培一样，他们相信自己的力量。
