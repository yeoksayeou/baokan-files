In the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Zigong, a key city in southern Sichuan, is better than ever. Here, Mao Zedong’s proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works is surging forward in cities and countryside. The struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism are developing extensively and deeply. Revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are being carried out better and better.

“People’s revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress.” The revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary rebels of Zigong, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployments, have waged a heroic struggle against China’s Khrushchev and his local agents, achieving one victory after another. The broad revolutionary masses have launched a massive criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by China’s Khrushchev and his local agents. Factories, rural areas, offices, schools, and streets have all become battlegrounds for revolutionary criticism. This city of 600,000 people has held more than 1,400 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 100,000 people participating in the study. The broad revolutionary masses study Chairman Mao’s works every day, applying them in practice, combining study with application, and seeing immediate results. Through studying Chairman Mao’s works and struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have been greatly promoted. Now, more than 90% of the units in the whole city have achieved and consolidated revolutionary great unity according to systems, departments, and classes. Workers’ congresses, peasants’ congresses, and red guards’ congresses have been established one after another, and many grassroots units have successively set up revolutionary committees or temporary leading bodies. The Zigong Revolutionary Committee was established on December 26 last year.

The broad revolutionary masses of Zigong have responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao’s great call to “grasp revolution, promote production.” Labor enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. Industrial production is rising steadily, and technological innovations are emerging one after another. Some products have reached production levels never seen before in history. In 1967, grain production increased by 7% compared to 1966, and oil crops also saw a significant increase. Revolutionary teachers and students in all schools have resumed classes and are making revolution, achieving initial results in criticizing the revisionist educational line and reforming teaching methods.

The people’s armed forces department of Zigong, known as the red flag for supporting the left in Sichuan, and the local garrison troops have made significant contributions to safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zigong. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Zigong, the people’s armed forces department and the garrison troops have been infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. They have clearly supported the proletarian revolutionary rebels and fought alongside them, ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zigong has continued to advance victoriously along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

    新华社成都电　在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，川南重镇自贡市的无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势空前大好。在这里，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性胜利，活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的高潮已经在城乡兴起，斗私批修活动正在广泛深入发展，革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合搞得越来越好。
      “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。自贡市的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地的代理人进行了英勇的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。广大革命群众大造党内一小撮走资派的反，大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线。工厂、农村、机关、学校、街道，到处都成了革命大批判的战场。这个六十万人口的城市，已先后举办了一千四百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有十万多人参加了学习。广大革命群众天天坚持学习毛主席著作，活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影。通过学习毛主席著作和斗私批修，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。现在，全市百分之九十以上的单位已经按系统、按部门、按班级实现和巩固了革命的大联合。工代会、农代会和红代会相继成立，许多基层单位陆续建立了革命委员会或临时领导机构。自贡市革命委员会已于去年十二月二十六日成立。
    自贡市的广大革命群众坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，劳动热情空前高涨。全市工业生产节节上升，技术革新不断涌现，有的产品产量创造了历史上从来没有过的水平。一九六七年粮食产量比一九六六年增长百分之七，油料作物也有较大幅度的增产。各校革命师生都已复课闹革命，在批判修正主义教育路线和教学改革方面取得了初步成效。
    被誉为四川地区支左红旗的自贡市人民武装部和当地驻军一道，在保卫自贡市无产阶级文化大革命中作出了重大贡献。在自贡市两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，市人民武装部和驻军无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，旗帜鲜明地支持无产阶级革命派，跟革命派一起战斗，使自贡市的无产阶级文化大革命一直沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
