Tokyo, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two progressive newspapers in Japan, *People's News* and *Long Weekly News*, published New Year's editorials and greetings respectively, celebrating the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

The New Year's editorial of *People's News* pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest Marxism-Leninism of our time. Chairman Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, elevating it to a new stage.

The editorial enthusiastically foresaw the excellent situation of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution in 1968, predicting that China's socialist cause would make great strides forward; the national liberation struggles in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, India, and other countries, as well as the revolutionary movements around the world, would achieve leapfrog development in the new year.

The editorial said: The Japanese people should strive to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. As Comrade Lin Biao said, "We must learn with problems in mind, apply what we learn, integrate learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see results immediately." The editorial called on the Japanese people to make 1968 a year of using Mao Zedong Thought to promote the leapfrog development of the Japanese revolutionary struggle.

In its New Year's greeting titled "Hoist High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought," *Long Weekly News* said: The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has mobilized 700 million people and is advancing victoriously. The victory of this cultural revolution has transcended the borders of China, inspiring the people of the world and making the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionist clique of the Soviet Union, and their followers and reactionaries in various countries tremble with fear.

The greeting said: The current era is the new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought shines brilliantly over the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of all oppressed peoples and nations fighting against imperialism and its lackeys. The stance one takes towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, progress and reaction, standing with the people and standing with imperialism.

After condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Sato government, which is the lackey of Japanese monopolies, as well as the crimes of the revisionist clique led by Komoto, the greeting pointed out: The current most important task for the Japanese people is to fight against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries led by Sato Eisaku, and the modern revisionism of the Soviet Union and Komoto.

The greeting said: The great teacher of the world's people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long."

The greeting said that the revolutionary people of Yamaguchi Prefecture, full of confidence and courage, are advancing bravely, daring to struggle and fearing no difficulties. They are strengthening unity with the revolutionary people of the whole country, strengthening unity between the peoples of China and Japan, and strengthening unity among the peoples of the world. They are resolutely fighting to overthrow the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys. We pledge to strive for the completion of this great cause.

    新华社讯　东京消息：日本两家进步报刊《人民新闻》和《长周新闻》分别发表元旦社论和新年献词，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    《人民新闻》的元旦社论指出：毛泽东思想是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义，毛泽东主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    社论热情洋溢地展望在一九六八年中国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，它预计中国的社会主义事业将大大推向前进；越南、老挝、泰国、印度等国的民族解放斗争和全世界的革命运动将会在新的一年中获得飞跃的发展。
    社论说：日本人民要努力活学活用毛泽东思想，要象林彪同志所说的那样：“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”。社论号召日本人民努力使一九六八年成为运用毛泽东思想促进日本革命斗争飞跃发展的一年。
    《长周新闻》在题为《高举毛泽东思想的旗帜》的新年献词中说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在毛泽东思想的指引下，把七亿人民动员起来，正在胜利地向前发展。这场文化大革命的胜利的影响超越了中国一国的范围，它给全世界人民以无限鼓舞，使美帝为首的帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义领导集团及其追随者和各国反动派吓得发抖。
    献词说：当前的时代是毛泽东思想的新时代。毛泽东思想光辉灿烂地照耀着全世界，毛泽东思想是同帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的旗帜。对毛主席和毛泽东思想采取什么样的立场，是革命和反革命、进步和反动、站在人民方面和站在帝国主义方面的分水岭。
    献词在谴责美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的奴仆佐藤政府以及宫本修正主义集团的种种罪行后指出：反对美帝国主义、反对以佐藤荣作为首的日本反动派、反对苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团的斗争，是日本人民当前最重大的任务。
    献词说：世界人民的伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”
    献词说，山口县的革命人民满怀信心和勇气，前赴后继，敢于斗争，不怕困难，加强和全国革命人民的团结，加强日中两国人民的团结，加强全世界人民的团结，坚决打倒美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗。我们誓为完成这一伟大的事业而奋斗。
