According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xujia Yuan Production Brigade in Luowenzhao Commune, Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, with the help of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." They have mobilized the masses to continuously deepen the revolutionary criticism. The entire brigade, from cadres to the masses, from people in their seventies and eighties to children in primary school, ninety percent of the people have joined this great struggle.

When this brigade first started the revolutionary criticism, they did not link the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev with the local class struggle well enough, and some people did not fully understand the significance of the revolutionary criticism. To address this issue, the brigade leadership, with the help of the army, organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle, and to thoroughly review the local class struggle history. They then followed the clues, traced the roots, and exposed Chinese Khrushchev as the backer of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They then focused on Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary statements, examined their influence and harm in this brigade, and found the poisonous influence of Chinese Khrushchev in this brigade. In this way, they exposed the black line of Chinese Khrushchev from top to bottom, arousing the deep hatred of the poor and lower-middle peasants towards Chinese Khrushchev, and angrily exposing and denouncing his evil plot to restore capitalism in the countryside.

After a period of revolutionary criticism, the brigade cadres found that some revolutionary masses thought that the top handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party had been exposed, and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the county party had been overthrown. The class enemies could not stage a comeback, and the task of criticism had been completed. The brigade then organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle, to carry out activities recalling bitterness and sweetness, and to have thorough discussions. Everyone realized that if they did not further criticize Chinese Khrushchev and other handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party deeply and thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory, they could not thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

After the revolutionary masses and cadres raised their awareness, their fighting spirit became stronger, and a high tide of revolutionary criticism was launched. Not only did the brigade and production teams hold criticism meetings, but some community members also held family criticism meetings. The brigade and production teams set up columns for revolutionary criticism. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with their own bitter family histories, denounced Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the "exploitation is beneficial" theory; with the facts of class enemies counterattacking when Chiang Kai-shek clamored to invade the mainland, they refuted Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the "class struggle extinction" theory; linking it to the actual situation of the single farming black wind in this brigade, they severely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" black goods; listing the facts of class enemies framing revolutionary cadres during the "Four Cleanups" movement, they criticized Chinese Khrushchev's praise of the "Peach Garden Experience"; citing the activities of class enemies in this brigade during the Cultural Revolution, they criticized Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "Chinese Khrushchev wants to drag us back to the old society, absolutely not!"

In the revolutionary criticism, Xujia Yuan Brigade, with "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to promote the deepening of the revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly exposed the manifestations of "selfishness," investigated the harm of "selfishness," and deeply traced the connection between "selfishness" and "revisionism." They said: Without criticizing "selfishness," the revolution cannot be carried out, and the criticism cannot be deep. They insisted on studying and applying the "Three Old Articles," continuously raising their ideological awareness, criticizing "selfishness" more fiercely, and repudiating "revisionism" more deeply.

In the revolutionary criticism meeting, poor and lower-middle peasant community members of Liujia Hekou Production Brigade in Bai Chi He Commune, Zoucheng County, Shandong Province, severely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" counter-revolutionary fallacies.

    狠抓斗私批修发动贫下中农参加大批判
    大摆村史家史搞臭中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论
    许家园大队从干部到群众，从老人到小学生，百分之九十的人投入战斗
    据新华社太原电　山西省阳高县罗文皂公社许家园大队贫下中农和革命干部在人民解放军当地驻军帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的教导，发动群众，不断深入地开展革命大批判。全大队从干部到群众，从七八十岁的老人到八九岁的小学生，百分之九十的人都投入了这场伟大的战斗。
    这个大队在刚开始搞革命大批判的时候，由于没有把对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判同当地阶级斗争的实际很好地“挂钩”，有的群众对革命大批判的意义认识不足。针对这一问题，大队领导班子在解放军的帮助下，组织贫下中农反复学习了毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，大摆本村阶级斗争史，然后顺藤摸瓜，挖根溯源，挖出了中国赫鲁晓夫这个地富反坏右的总后台；接着又抓住中国赫鲁晓夫的反动论调，在本大队查影响，找危害，找出了中国赫鲁晓夫在这个大队的流毒。这样上挖根源，下查危害，把中国赫鲁晓夫贯穿上下的一条黑线揪住了，激起了贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，愤怒地揭发、控诉他妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    在进行了一段革命大批判之后，大队的干部发现有些革命群众认为，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经揪出来，本县党内一小撮走资派也被打倒了，阶级敌人翻不过来了，大批判任务已经完成。大队就组织贫下中农和革命干部反复学习了毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，开展忆苦思甜活动，进行充分讨论，大家认识到，如果不进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，批深批透，批倒批臭，那就不能彻底肃清反革命修正主义的流毒。
    革命群众和革命干部的认识提高以后，斗志越来越旺，掀起了革命大批判的高潮，不仅大队、生产队召开批判大会，一些社员还开了家庭批判会；大队和生产队办起了大批判专栏。贫下中农和革命干部以自己血泪斑斑的苦难家史，怒斥中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“剥削有功”论；以蒋介石叫嚣窜犯大陆时阶级敌人反攻倒算的事实，批驳中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；联系本大队刮起单干黑风的实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”“四大自由”黑货；列举阶级敌人在“四清”运动中陷害革命干部的事实，批判中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧的“桃园经验”；举出本大队文化大革命中阶级敌人的活动，批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线。贫下中农气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫要把我们拉回旧社会，绝对办不到！”
    许家园大队在革命大批判中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，举办毛泽东思想学习班，促进革命大批判深入发展。革命干部和贫下中农在学习班里，以毛泽东思想为武器，大摆“私”字的表现，大查“私”字的危害，深追“私”字与“修”字的联系。他们说：不斗掉“私”字，革命革不成，批判批不深。他们坚持活学活用“老三篇”，思想觉悟不断提高，斗“私”越斗越狠，批“修”越批越深。（附图片）
