The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the Jilin garrison used the method of taking one point to lead many points to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping a number of factories to achieve revolutionary great unity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Longchuan: The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain command company of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jilin Province, after helping the two revolutionary factions of the Tonghua Rubber Factory to achieve revolutionary great unity by system and by group, revolutionary masses from many factories and enterprises came to seek advice and requested the soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go to their factories to help hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After discussing with the revolutionary committee of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the rubber factory, the soldiers of the command company's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team decided to invite representatives from the two revolutionary factions of eight nearby factories and enterprises to jointly hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class at the rubber factory.

The participants, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and the experience of the rubber factory in achieving revolutionary great unity as a model, focused on the problems existing in the various factories and enterprises in the process of preparing for revolutionary great unity. They fought against selfishness, resolved contradictions, and prepared for unity while learning, thereby enabling some units' revolutionary mass organizations to quickly unite under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. For example, the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Commercial Label Factory failed to reach an agreement on revolutionary great unity twice before participating in the study class due to insufficient self-criticism. This time, with the help of the PLA, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and invited representatives from the rubber factory to "share experiences on the spot," specifically introducing how they followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to fight against selfishness, criticize revisionism, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and eliminate factionalism. The representatives of the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Commercial Label Factory who participated in the study class received a great education and immediately returned to the factory to convey the information. They then held discussions together and quickly reached an agreement, achieving revolutionary great unity.

The soldiers of the command company's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, in order to promote this method of taking one point to lead many points and spreading the red from one point to a whole area, after obtaining approval from higher authorities, took further measures. They selected a number of soldiers and comrades who had participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class to jointly help hold a number of new Mao Zedong Thought study classes in nearby units. The students who had participated in the rubber factory's study class served as both teachers and students in the new study classes. They adopted various forms according to the specific situations and different problems of each factory, successively holding meetings for leaders to open their hearts mainly to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and experience-sharing meetings mainly to help revolutionary masses improve their awareness of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, etc. They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon and the experience of the rubber factory as a model to help some units that had not yet united to achieve revolutionary great unity, and to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity of units that had already united. The revolutionary masses joyfully said: The comrades of the PLA have brought Chairman Mao's latest instructions to our hearts, truly a timely rain!

    以毛泽东思想为武器斗私批修
    吉林驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，用以点带面的办法举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助一部分工厂实现了革命的大联合
    据新华社长春电　驻吉林省人民解放军某部指挥连毛泽东思想宣传队，在帮助通化市橡胶厂两派革命群众按系统、按班组实现革命大联合以后，许多工厂企业的革命群众纷纷登门取经，并要求解放军毛泽东思想宣传队同志到他们厂里帮助举办毛泽东思想学习班。根据附近工厂革命群众的要求，指挥连毛泽东思想宣传队的同志和橡胶厂无产阶级革命派大联合委员会商量以后，把附近八个工厂企业的两派革命群众组织代表吸收进来，在橡胶厂共同举办了毛泽东思想学习班。
    参加学习的人，以毛主席最新指示为纲，以橡胶厂实现革命大联合的经验为样板，针对各工厂企业在酝酿革命大联合中存在的问题，狠斗私心，边学边解疙瘩，边学边筹备联合，促使一些单位的革命群众组织在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，迅速联合起来。例如，商标厂两派革命群众组织的负责人，在参加学习班学习之前，两次协商大联合，但因双方自我批评精神不够，没谈成功。这次他们在解放军的帮助下，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，并请橡胶厂的代表“现场传经”，具体介绍他们按照毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，铲除山头的经验。商标厂参加学习的两派革命群众组织的代表受到极大教育，立刻回厂传达。接着，他们又共同协商，很快达成协议，实现了革命的大联合。
    指挥连毛泽东思想宣传队同志为了把这种以点带面，由一点红带动一片红的做法推广开来，经过上级批准，又进一步采取措施，抽出一部分指战员和参加过毛泽东思想学习班学习的一些同志，一起到附近各单位，帮助举办了一批新的毛泽东思想学习班。参加过橡胶厂学习班学习的学员，在新的学习班里既当教员又做学员。他们针对各厂的具体情况和不同问题，采取各种形式，先后召开了以克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性为主的头头交心会，以帮助革命群众提高斗私批修自觉性为主的经验交流会，等等。他们以毛主席最新指示为武器，以橡胶厂的经验为样板，帮助一些没有联合起来的单位实现了革命大联合，已经联合起的单位巩固和发展了革命大联合。革命群众高兴地说：解放军同志把毛主席的最新指示送到了我们心坎里，真是及时雨啊！
