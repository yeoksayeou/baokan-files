Shijingshan Middle School: How to Persist in Resuming Classes and Making Revolution

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, with the help of the military training team, have seriously studied, executed, and defended Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have withstood the trend of "stopping classes to make revolution" and repelled the serious onslaught of anarchist thinking. They have thoroughly smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational system, and boldly carried out educational reforms. They are now forcefully changing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School in Beijing, with the help of the military training team of the People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps 8729, have, since the beginning of military training over ten months ago, resolutely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution. They have firmly established Mao Zedong Thought and are forcefully changing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school. Now, the political atmosphere of studying, applying, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is becoming increasingly strong in this school. The political consciousness of the proletariat has greatly increased. Teachers and students have made explorations in various aspects to create a new proletarian educational system and have taken gratifying steps.

Following Chairman Mao's Instructions and Resolutely Keeping Up

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our times." "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, have seriously studied the PLA and followed Chairman Mao's instructions with great enthusiasm. In every stage of the struggle between the two lines, they have always resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions.

After Chairman Mao issued the "three-seven" instruction, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School, with the help of the military training team, quickly mobilized to fight for the implementation and defense of Chairman Mao's "three-seven" instruction. At that time, the opposition between cadres and the masses, between teachers and students, and among students caused by the bourgeois reactionary line, and the unclear class lines, seriously hindered the implementation of the "three-seven" instruction. They thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely took the path of revolutionary unity of Yan'an Middle School based on teaching classes.

First, they actively applied Mao Zedong's work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." They exposed the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, discussed its harm, and traced its roots, following the clues to direct the spearhead at China's Khrushchev. Through the struggle, everyone distinguished between enemies and ourselves, established Chairman Mao's class analysis viewpoint, and recognized that the group of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the mortal enemy of the proletariat. The revolutionary faction of the proletariat united and educated the masses who were deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, and together fought against the enemy.

Second, they actively applied the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," fiercely fought against selfishness, and thoroughly smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Twenty-seven revolutionary mass organizations across classes and research groups achieved revolutionary unity based on classes, and the entire school unified the Red Guards organization.

Third, they actively applied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," distinguished between two types of contradictions, drew the line between revolution and counter-revolution, between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and between proletarian leaders in power and bourgeois leaders in power. They fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line on the issue of cadres, "striking a large area and protecting a small group," and boldly liberated and used cadres and teachers, achieving the three-in-one combination of revolution, and consolidating revolutionary unity based on classes and systems. They made organizational and certain ideological preparations for implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction of resuming classes and making revolution.

Regarding Chairman Mao's great instruction of "resuming classes and making revolution," they also closely followed it in the struggle. At that time, some people within the school thought that resuming classes would cause the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to "abort"; some people outside the school came to post big-character posters, "urging Shijingshan Middle School teachers and students to stop classes and connect with society," saying that only in this way could the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat be carried out to the end. Some students were already preparing to connect with society outside. The Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the military training team, organized everyone to study the relevant documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the relevant editorials of the newspapers, realizing that revolutionary teachers and students could only return to school to resume classes and make revolution, which would be beneficial to leading the school's movement onto the proletarian track, beneficial to the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, and could implement Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts. In this way, they withstood the trend of "stopping classes to make revolution" and continuous social connections, and relatively timely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. On April 11, 1967, the entire school began to resume classes and make revolution.

Implementing Chairman Mao's Instructions Unwaveringly

Chairman Mao taught: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns. In socialist undertakings, to think that one can achieve success without encountering twists and turns and without paying great efforts, and that everything will be smooth sailing, is merely an illusion."

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School had just taken the first step in achieving revolutionary unity and resuming classes to make revolution when they were severely impacted by the anarchist trend in society. The first wave was the so-called "Shijingshan's unity is a hodgepodge," with some people outside the school inciting a few students in Shijingshan to make an "internal revolution." A few teachers and students inside the school collaborated with the outside trend, withdrew from the unity, and established another faction. Immediately, a more serious wave hit, which was the so-called "Shijingshan has not dug out the capitalist-roaders, the three-in-one combination is a capitalist restoration," "Shijingshan's military training team is implementing the bourgeois reactionary line." At that time, Shijingshan became the focal point of anarchist trends in the city's middle schools.

In the face of the severe impact of anarchist trends, the revolutionary teachers and students of Shijingshan Middle School and the military training team stood closely together, bravely defended, actively propagated, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, vowing not to retreat. With the help of the PLA, every time they were impacted, they deeply studied Chairman Mao's instructions, checked their work, found their shortcomings, and improved. Through repeated study, repeated checks, and improvement of work, they firmly believed that the PLA stationed in Shijingshan Middle School loyally implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, supported the left without supporting factions; Shijingshan Middle School's unity and three-in-one combination were revolutionary and in line with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the more they were impacted, the deeper the teachers and students understood Chairman Mao's instructions, the stronger their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, and the more they cultivated the consciousness to defend and propagate Chairman Mao's instructions. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School felt that it was precisely in this sharp and complex struggle that the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought was more fully demonstrated.

After repelling the impact of anarchist trends, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School did not relax their struggle. They seized the opportunity to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, first grasping the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadre group, thoroughly smashing the remnants of anarchist trends and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in the minds of leading cadres, uniting as one, and leading the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to seize new victories.

Seriously Studying and Implementing Chairman Mao's Instructions

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shijingshan Middle School realized in the practice of struggle that to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the most fundamental thing is to instill Chairman Mao's thoughts into the students and cultivate their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, in every stage of the movement, although many practical problems and ideological issues emerged, presenting a complex and chaotic situation, they, with the help of the PLA, could grasp the essence from the myriad of issues, that is, to firmly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works and implement Chairman Mao's instructions. The 8729 Corps set an example in this regard.

When the troops entered the school, facing the serious damage caused by the bourgeois reactionary line to the proletarian cultural revolution in the school, they first firmly grasped the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's "three-seven" instruction. With their deep class feelings of being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and exemplary actions, they transmitted the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, carried forward the four firsts, and passed on the whole set of good experiences, methods, and traditions of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, such as the PLA's daily reading, small rectification meetings, and experience-sharing meetings, to the revolutionary teachers and students. This deepened the teachers and students' love for Chairman Mao, learned the principle of acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and learned the methods of doing ideological work for people.

After resuming classes and making revolution, the old teaching methods, old teaching policies, and old educational systems needed to be reformed. How to reform? Where would the new ones come from? Many problems were presented. Revolutionary youngsters wrote revolutionary big-character posters after class, demanding the reform of the old educational system; teachers also discussed after class, feeling that they could not teach. At this time, the PLA helped the Revolutionary Committee organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's "May Seventh" instruction, hold big debates, and make them realize that they must launch a big criticism of the revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the old educational system, and in the process of smashing, explore new things according to the "May Seventh" instruction, which could smash to the crux and establish the foundation. Teachers and students launched a big exposure, big accusation, and big criticism of the revisionist educational line and the old educational system, clearly recognizing that the revisionist educational line could only cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie and take the capitalist road, while Chairman Mao's educational thoughts were the beacon for cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's "May Seventh" instruction, fiercely criticized the revisionist educational line, and were full of confidence in creating a proletarian educational system. Chairman Mao taught: "Students are the same, with learning as the main focus, also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Teachers and students, following the direction of Chairman Mao's educational revolution, taught while reforming, and organized high-grade students into small teams to go to factories, villages, and units, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, investigating and visiting, collecting a large number of valuable opinions on reforming teaching systems, teaching methods, and teaching content. At the same time, they invited some old workers and poor peasants who had deep hatred for the old society to come to the school to teach the teachers and students; they specially invited some workers, PLA soldiers, and commune members with clear views on educational reform to be consultants for the school's educational revolution. Now, with the help of workers from Shijingshan Steel and Revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing Normal University, following the opinions of the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers, they have initially drafted an educational revolution plan and compiled new teaching outlines and some new teaching materials for subjects such as mathematics and physics. Teachers and students all deeply felt that educational revolution is complex, but the most fundamental thing is to study Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution and implement Chairman Mao's instructions.

Establishing a Revolutionary Good Learning Style

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of Shijingshan Middle School, after more than ten months of tempering and education in resuming classes and making revolution, have established an unlimited belief and deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao's works. They do not leave Chairman Mao's teachings in their mouths, do not leave Chairman Mao's instructions in their actions, and study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, repeatedly understand, and resolutely act, often check, and timely summarize.

After resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Shijingshan Middle School, with the enthusiastic help of the PLA, first resumed the courses of Mao Zedong Thought. All 33 teaching classes in the school established the system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on having Mao Zedong Thought guidance classes every week, holding study and application lectures of Chairman Mao's works every month, and convening a meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works every half year, cultivating the teachers and students' enthusiasm for diligent learning and the courage for bold practice.

Revolutionary teachers and students regard leading the school with Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of educational revolution. In teaching, in addition to Mao Zedong Thought guidance classes, self-criticism classes, and class education classes, all learning Mao Zedong Thought, language classes, foreign language classes, and other liberal arts teaching all take Mao Zedong Thought as the basic teaching material; mathematics classes, physics classes, and other science teaching also take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, from teaching ideas to teaching content, undergoing a series of changes. In the past, teachers liked students who had high scores and were obedient, but now those who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and have high ideological awareness have become respected good students. In the past, the classroom was the teacher's monologue, but now students have taken the stage, and workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers accepted the teachers and students' invitations to come to the school to teach. Teachers also fought shoulder to shoulder with students, regarding the classroom as a battlefield to destroy the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat.

    石景山中学是如何坚持复课闹革命的？
    沿着毛主席教育革命道路战斗前进
    革命师生员工在军训团帮助下，认真学习、执行和捍卫毛主席一系列最新指示，顶住了“停课”闹革命之风，击退了无政府主义思潮的严重冲击，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大批修正主义教育制度，拜工农兵为师，大胆进行教育改革的实践，正有力地改变着资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象
    据新华社十二日讯　北京市石景山中学的革命师生员工，在担任军训任务的人民解放军铁道兵八七二九部队帮助下，从军训开始以来的十个多月中，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的指示，大立毛泽东思想，正有力地改变着资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。现在，这个学校的革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席最新指示的政治空气越来越浓，无产阶级政治觉悟大大提高。师生们为创建新型的无产阶级教育制度进行了多方面的探索，迈出了可喜的一步。
  对毛主席的指示闻风而动坚决紧跟
    林副主席说：“毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜。”“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”石景山中学的革命师生员工遵照林副主席的指示，认真学习解放军，对毛主席的指示闻风而动，在两条路线斗争的各个阶段，始终坚决贯彻执行毛主席的指示。
    毛主席的“三七”指示发出后，石景山中学的革命师生员工在军训团帮助下，迅速动员起来，为执行和捍卫毛主席的“三七”指示而战斗。当时，资产阶级反动路线造成的干群之间、师生之间、同学之间的对立和阶级阵线不清的状况，严重地阻碍着“三七”指示的贯彻。他们就对资产阶级反动路线进行了彻底的批判，坚决走延安中学以教学班为基础实现革命大联合的道路。
    第一步，他们活学活用毛主席著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》。摆资产阶级反动路线的罪状，论其危害，挖其根源，顺藤摸瓜，把矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫。大家从斗争中分清了敌我，树立了毛主席的阶级分析观点，认清了炮制资产阶级反动路线的党内最大的一小撮走资派是无产阶级的死敌。无产阶级革命派团结教育了受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，共同对敌。
    第二步，他们活学活用“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，狠斗私字，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。师生中二十七个跨班级、跨教研组的革命群众组织，按班级实现了革命大联合，全校统一了红卫兵组织。
    第三步，他们活学活用毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，分清两类不同性质的矛盾，划清革命和反革命、无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线、无产阶级当权派和资产阶级当权派的界限，狠批在干部问题上
  “打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，大胆解放与使用干部和教师，实现革命三结合，巩固了按班级、按系统的革命大联合，为执行毛主席复课闹革命的伟大指示做了组织准备和一定的思想准备。
    对于毛主席“复课闹革命”的伟大指示，他们也是在战斗中紧跟上去。当时校内有人以为复课就会使无产阶级文化大革命“夭折”；校外有人来贴大字报，“敦促石中师生停课，到社会上串连”，说是这样才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。有些学生已经准备到外地串连。校革委会在军训团帮助下，组织大家学习中共中央的有关文件和报纸的有关社论，认识到革命师生只有回学校复课闹革命，才有利于把学校的运动引入无产阶级轨道，才有利于学校的斗、批、改，才能贯彻毛主席的教育革命思想。这样，顶住了“停课”闹革命和继续进行社会大串连的风，比较及时地跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。一九六七年四月十一日，全校就开始复课闹革命。
        执行毛主席指示坚定不移
    毛主席教导说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    石景山中学的革命师生员工在实现革命大联合和复课闹革命的道路上刚刚迈出一步，就受到社会上无政府主义思潮的严重冲击。头一个风浪就是所谓“石中的大联合是大杂烩”，校外有人鼓动石中少数学生搞“内部革命”。校内有极少数师生和社会上的风浪相配合，退出大联合，另立了山头。紧接着，第二个更为严重的风浪又迎头打来，这就是所谓“石中没有揪出走资派，三结合是资本主义复辟”，“石中军训部队执行的是资产阶级反动路线”。当时，石中成了全市中学里受无政府主义思潮冲击的焦点。
    在无政府主义思潮严重的冲击面前，石景山中学无产阶级革命派师生和军训部队紧密站在一起，勇敢捍卫、积极宣传、坚决执行毛主席的指示，誓死不回头。他们在解放军帮助下，每受一次冲击，就深入学习一次毛主席的指示，检查一次工作，找一次缺点，进一步改进。经过反复学习、反复检查和改进工作，他们坚信：在石景山中学执行军训任务的解放军忠实地执行了毛主席的革命路线，支左不支派；石景山中学的大联合、三结合是革命的，是符合毛泽东思想的。因此，越受冲击，师生们越加深了对毛主席指示的理解，越加强了对毛主席的无产阶级感情，越培养了捍卫和宣传毛主席指示的自觉性。石景山中学革命师生员工体会到，正是在这尖锐复杂的斗争中，才更加显示出毛泽东思想的无穷威力。
    击退无政府主义思潮的冲击之后，石景山中学的革命师生员工并没有放松战斗。他们抓紧举办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，首先抓领导班子的思想革命化，大破领导骨干头脑中无政府主义思潮的残余和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，团结一致，带领全校革命师生，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，去夺取新的胜利。
    认真学习、条条落实毛主席的指示
    石景山中学的革命师生员工在斗争实践中认识到，要培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，最根本的一点，就是把毛主席的思想灌输到学生中去，培养他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。因此，在运动的各个阶段，尽管涌现出许多实际问题和思想认识问题，呈现出复杂纷纭的现象，但是，他们在解放军帮助下，能从千头万绪中抓住根本，即狠抓对毛主席著作的学习，条条落实毛主席的指示。八七二九部队在这方面给他们做了榜样。
    部队入校时，面对着资产阶级反动路线给学校无产阶级文化大革命带来的严重破坏，首先狠抓了对毛主席“三七”指示的学习和落实，他们以无限忠于毛主席革命路线的深厚阶级感情和模范行动，传三八作风，带四个第一，把解放军天天读、小整风、讲用会等一整套活学活用毛主席著作的好经验、好方法、好传统，传授给革命师生，使师生们加深了热爱毛主席的感情，学到了按毛主席指示办事的原则，学到了做人的思想工作的方法。
    复课闹革命开始以后，旧的教学方法、旧的教学方针、旧的教育制度要改革，怎么改革？新的又从哪里来？许多问题摆在面前。革命小将听完课就写出革命的大字报，要求改革旧的教育制度；教师上完一堂课也议论纷纷，感到教不下去。这时，解放军帮助校革委会组织大家学习毛主席的“五七”指示，展开大辩论，使他们认识到必须对修正主义教育路线展开大批判，大破旧的教育制度，在大破中按照“五七”指示进行新的探索，就能破到要害处，立到根本上。师生们对修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度展开了大揭发、大控诉、大批判，清楚地认识到，修正主义教育路线只能培养资产阶级接班人，走资本主义道路，毛主席的教育思想是造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的灯塔。
    广大革命师生大学毛主席“五七”指示，大批修正主义教育路线，对创建无产阶级教育制度充满了信心。毛主席教导说：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”师生们沿着毛主席指引的教育革命航向，边教学，边改革，并且由高年级的学生组成小分队，下厂下乡下连队，拜工农兵为师，到工农兵群众中调查访问，搜集了改革教学制度、教学方法、教学内容的大量可贵意见。同时，他们邀请一些对旧社会苦大仇深的老工人和老贫农，到学校来给师生们讲课；特约一些对教改有鲜明见解的工人、解放军指战员和公社社员为学校教育革命当参谋。现在革命师生在石钢工人和北京师范大学革命师生的帮助下，按照广大工农兵的意见，已经初步拟定出一份教育革命的规划方案，编写出数学、物理等学科新的教学大纲和部分新教材。师生们都深有体会地说，教育革命千头万绪，最根本的就是一条：学习毛主席关于教育革命的指示，落实毛主席的指示。
          建立革命的好学风
    石景山中学的广大革命师生经历十个多月复课闹革命的锻炼和教育，对毛主席著作建立起无限信仰、无限热爱的深厚阶级感情。他们口不离毛主席的教导，行动不离毛主席的指示，对毛主席著作，对毛主席的最新指示，学了就用，反复领会，坚决照办，经常检查，及时总结。
    复课闹革命以后，石景山中学的革命师生在解放军的热情帮助下，首先复了毛泽东思想课。全校三十三个教学班都建立了活学活用毛主席著作的制度，坚持周周有毛主席著作辅导课，月月开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，半年召开一次学习毛主席著作积极分子会，培养师生们勤奋学习的热情和大胆实践的勇气。
    革命师生把以毛泽东思想统帅学校，当成教育革命的根本任务。在教学上，除毛主席著作辅导课、斗私批修课、阶级教育课，都学习毛主席著作外，语文课、外语课等文科教学都以毛主席著作作为基本教材；数学课、物理课等理科教学也以毛泽东思想作为统帅，从教学思想到教学内容，起了一系列变化。过去教师喜爱的是分数高又听话的孩子，现在活学活用毛主席著作好，思想觉悟高的成了受尊敬的好学生。过去课堂是教师的一言堂，现在学生登上了讲台，工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员接受师生的邀请，来学校讲课。教师们也和学生并肩战斗，把课堂当成灭资兴无的战场。
