Only the selfless have great courage.

The "Sea and Air Eagles Unit"  Wáng Hóngxǐ  Shū Jīchéng  Gāo Xiáng

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the "fusion of public and private interests," claiming that "serving the people wholeheartedly will bring personal benefits." It turns out that under the guise of "serving the people wholeheartedly," the goal is to obtain "personal benefits."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly," "be selfless and altruistic," "completely selfless and dedicated to others." The comrades of our "Sea and Air Eagles Unit" follow Chairman Mao's teachings, taking revolutionary martyrs as examples, and strive to establish a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly. Everyone holds flight maps in their hands and thinks of world revolution in their minds. With such a lofty ideal, combat becomes extraordinarily brave. Whether it is the so-called "ace aircraft" of the United States, including RF-101s and unmanned aircraft, coming from low altitudes or high altitudes, we have all shot them down. Each of our battle victories is a victory of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Selflessness leads to fearlessness, and fearlessness leads to invincibility. In 1965, we were tasked with shooting down the U.S. imperialist's high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. To shoot down such enemy aircraft, we had to fly to a certain altitude, and there were many difficulties. However, our comrades actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, cast aside selfish thoughts, and firmly establish the idea of fighting "completely" and "thoroughly" for the Chinese people and the people of the world. We overcame various difficulties and flew to new heights. Upon discovering the invading enemy aircraft, we focused intently, chased it down, locked onto the enemy aircraft, and approached it closer and closer. Sometimes, we were only a few tens of meters away from colliding with the enemy aircraft, which was indeed very dangerous. However, we were not afraid of sacrifice, overcame all difficulties, and finally shot down the enemy aircraft.

Only the selfless have great courage. When a person casts aside the "self," they will generate astonishing power. In our aerial battles with the enemy, we always encounter various difficulties and dangers. However, we remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people." As long as we have the determination to fear no sacrifice, we can generate the courage to overcome all difficulties and find ways to overcome all difficulties, with an "unyielding spirit" to defeat the enemy. We can proudly declare: Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest people!

The selfless and fearless revolutionary spirit is not innate but is formed in the process of "seizing the day" to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Each battle against the enemy is the most severe test for us. In the brief aerial combat, even a moment of hesitation will miss the opportunity; if there is any fear of difficulty or a desire to live, if the "self" even flashes for a moment, it may lead to failure.

In the realm of ideology, we must not mix "public and private interests" or "public-private partnerships." Our soldiers say well: Selfish thoughts are the strongholds of the bourgeoisie in our minds. If you do not eliminate them, they will devour you. The Chinese Khrushchev desperately fights for the "self," aiming to consolidate and expand the bourgeoisie's ideological strongholds. We revolutionary soldiers will not be fooled. We must hate bourgeois ideology as we hate class enemies, seize every fleeting thought, and fight against the "self" every day, every month, and every year. We must continually reform ourselves and thoroughly transform our worldview.

Our "Sea and Air Eagles Unit" will definitely charge onto the battlefield of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," smashing the bourgeois worldview of the Chinese Khrushchev to smithereens; we will continuously and consciously arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, achieve ideological revolutionization, forever preserve revolutionary youth, and with a bayonet-charging spirit, fight for a bright new world of Mao Zedong Thought.

    大公才有大勇
   “海空雄鹰团”  王鸿喜  舒积成  高翔
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“公私溶化论”，说什么“全心全意为人民服务，个人利益就会到来”。原来，装着“全心全意为人民服务”的样子，为的却是得到“个人利益”。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务”，“毫无自私自利之心”，“毫不利己专门利人”。我们“海空雄鹰团”的同志正是遵循毛主席的教导，以革命先烈为榜样，努力树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观。大家手里拿着飞行图，脑子里想着世界革命。有了这样崇高的理想，作战才能无比英勇，什么美国的所谓“王牌飞机”，其中包括RF101、无人驾驶飞机等，无论是从低空来的，还是从高空来的，都被我们揍下来了。我们每一次的战斗胜利，都是破私立公的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    无私才能无畏，无畏才能无敌。一九六五年，我们接受了打美帝无人驾驶高空侦察机的任务。要击落这种敌机必须飞到一定的高度，困难是很多的。然而，我们的同志活学活用毛主席著作，抛掉私心杂念，牢固地树立“完全”“彻底”为中国人民和世界人民而战的思想，克服了种种困难，飞出新的高度。当发现入侵的敌机后，我们全神贯注，猛追上去，咬住敌机，向它靠近再靠近，有时只差一、二十米就要同敌机相撞了，的确很危险，然而我们不怕牺牲，排除万难，终于打下了敌机。
    大公才有大勇。一个人抛掉了“私”字，就会产生惊人的力量。在我们同空中敌人的搏斗中，总是遇到这样或那样的困难与危险，然而，我们牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”我们只要有了不怕牺牲的决心，就能产生排除万难的勇气，就能想出排除万难的方法，以“一往无前的精神”战胜敌人。我们可以豪迈地高呼：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最勇敢的人！
    无私无畏的革命精神，不是天生的，而是在“只争朝夕”的破私立公的过程中形成的。每一次对敌作战都是对我们最严峻的考验。在很短促的空中作战中，只要有一丝犹豫，就会失去战机；只要有畏难情绪或贪生怕死的念头，只要“私”字一闪，就可能失败。
    在思想领域里，绝不能搞“公私溶化”、“公私合营”。我们的战士说得好：私心杂念是资产阶级安在我们头脑中的阵地，你不消灭它，它就要吃掉你。中国赫鲁晓夫拚命地为“私”字争地盘，就是为了巩固和扩大资产阶级思想阵地，我们革命战士决不上当。我们要象仇恨阶级敌人一样仇恨资产阶级思想，抓住一闪而过的念头，和“私”字天天斗、月月斗、年年斗，不断革自己的命，彻底改造世界观。
    我们“海空雄鹰团”一定要在“斗私，批修”的战场上，冲锋陷阵，把中国赫鲁晓夫那一套资产阶级世界观砸个稀巴烂；不断地、自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，实现思想革命化，永葆革命青春，用拚刺刀的精神打出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
