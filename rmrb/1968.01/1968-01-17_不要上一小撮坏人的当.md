I am a salesperson at a department store. Recently, I noticed that some factories and enterprises are engaging in disguised forms of bonuses and welfare benefits. They use the remaining funds at the end of the year to purchase wool fabrics to make "work uniforms" for their employees. For example, a glass production team bought nearly a hundred meters of fine wool fabric; an electromechanical production unit bought one hundred and sixty meters of suit fabric. In our store, just in the last five days of December last year, ten units came with letters of introduction from their enterprises and bought over five hundred meters of coarse wool fabric and one hundred and fifty meters of fine wool fabric. In fact, the employees of these production units do not actually need to wear wool work uniforms.

It is understood that this trend in some units is instigated by a few bad elements with ulterior motives. They use the pretext of "caring for the lives of the masses" to say things like, "We haven't had any benefits all year, it's New Year's! Let's get everyone a suit of fabric clothes!" In reality, they are attempting to use this to buy people's hearts, deceive the masses, sabotage the socialist economy, and shift the focus of the struggle.

The New Year's editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily pointed out: "The broad revolutionary masses must be thrifty and make revolution, cherish state property, consciously strengthen labor discipline, and resolutely criticize and resist the perverse winds of counter-revolutionary economism." We, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, must keep our eyes open. For the various tricks and deceptions of the class enemy, we must expose them in a timely manner and resolutely strike them down. We must not fall for the tricks of a few bad elements.

    不要上一小撮坏人的当
    我是百货商店的售货员。最近，我发现某些工厂、企业单位，搞变相的奖金、福利。他们用年终结余资金购买呢绒毛料做“工作服”发给职工。例如，一个玻璃生产组，买了近百米精纺呢料；一个机电生产单位，就买了制服呢一百六十米。在我们这个商店里，仅去年十二月底的五天，就有十个单位持企业介绍信买去粗纺呢五百多米，精纺毛料一百五十米。事实上，这些生产单位的职工根本不必要穿毛料的工作服。
    据了解，这股妖风在有的单位是一小撮别有用心的坏人煽动起来的。他们打着“关心群众生活”的幌子，说什么“我们一年到头没有什么福利，过年啦！每人弄一套料子服吧！”实际上，是妄图以此来收买人心，蒙蔽群众，破坏社会主义经济，转移斗争大方向。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论中指出：“广大革命群众要节约闹革命，爱护国家财产，自觉地加强劳动纪律，坚决批判和抵制反革命经济主义的歪风。”我们广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，一定要擦亮眼睛，对于阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计，要及时揭露，坚决打击，绝不要上一小撮坏人的当。
