Under the joint manipulation of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, after the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in late November last year to pressure Arab countries to surrender to the aggressors, the United Nations immediately dispatched a so-called "special envoy" to the Middle East to peddle this resolution, attempting to lure Arab countries into accepting the American and Soviet trap.

The United Nations "special envoy" Jarring began his secretive activities in mid-December, visiting the U.S. aggression tool in the Middle East, Israel, twice to engage in "secret talks" with the Israeli prime minister, foreign minister, and senior officials. He also conducted activities in Lebanon and Jordan. During his two visits to the UAR, Jarring held talks with UAR Foreign Minister Riad. On December 28, he also had "contact" in Cairo with Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Marko Nikic, who had come to the UAR for activities. In these activities, Jarring, under the guise of executing a "peace mission" in the Middle East and seeking a "peaceful resolution" to the Middle East issue, was working hard to coerce Arab countries to surrender to Israel under the control of the United Nations.

However, on the evening of December 28, Jarring was given the cold shoulder in Syria. Syrian Prime Minister Zain announced that Syria would not receive Jarring because Syria rejected the United Nations Security Council's resolution. Zain also condemned the U.S. and Britain for actively supporting Israel in the June war of aggression against the Arabs. At the same time, the Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* stated that Syria rejected Jarring's "mediation" and condemned Jarring's activities.

Earlier, the Syrian representative had stated in the Security Council that he could not accept the resolution passed by the Security Council. He pointed out that the resolution "acknowledges the results of the aggression by the aggressors" and "harms Arab interests, giving Israel more."

The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry issued a statement a few hours before Jarring's arrival in the UAR on December 18, rejecting the United Nations resolution on the Middle East issue and insisting on demanding that Israel withdraw its invading troops from the Arab territories it occupied.

The resolution of the United Nations Security Council and Jarring's visit to the Middle East have also been widely condemned by the peoples and public opinion of various Arab countries.

Jarring arrived in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, on December 30. He will go to New York to report to United Nations Secretary-General U Thant on his activities in the Middle East.

    鬼鬼祟祟兜售美苏黑货　假情假意欺骗人们上钩
    联合国“特使”到中东搞诱降活动
    新华社三日讯　在美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团联合操纵下，联合国安理会在去年十一月底就中东问题通过一项逼迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者投降的提案以后，联合国接着就派遣一个所谓“特使”到中东地区，兜售这个决议，妄图诱使阿拉伯国家接受美苏的圈套。
    联合国“特使”雅林从十二月中旬开始鬼鬼祟祟地两次到美帝在中东的侵略工具以色列活动，同以色列总理、外长和高级官员进行“密谈”。他还到黎巴嫩和约旦进行活动。雅林两次在阿联活动期间，同阿联外长里亚德进行了会谈。十二月二十八日，他在开罗还同专程到阿联活动的南斯拉夫外交国务秘书马尔科·尼凯集奇进行了“接触”。雅林在这些活动中打着什么执行“中东和平使命”，谋求中东问题的“和平解决”的旗号，为美苏控制的联合国胁逼阿拉伯国家向以色列投降大效犬马之劳。
    但是，雅林十二月二十八日晚在叙利亚吃了闭门羹。叙利亚总理扎因宣布，叙利亚不接见雅林，因为叙利亚拒绝联合国安理会的决议。扎因总理还谴责美、英在去年六月侵略阿拉伯的战争中积极支持以色列。在这同时，叙利亚《复兴报》说，叙利亚拒绝雅林的“调停”，并谴责雅林的活动。
    早些时候，叙利亚代表在安理会上发言时曾表示不能接受安理会通过的提案。他指出，这个提案“向侵略者表示承认他们的侵略成果”，“损害阿拉伯权益，使以色列获得更多东西”。
    科威特外交部在十二月十八日雅林到达阿联活动前几小时发表一项声明，拒绝联合国关于中东问题的决议，并坚持要求以色列从被它占领的阿拉伯领土上撤走侵略军。
    联合国安理会的决议和雅林的中东之行还遭到了阿拉伯各国广大人民和公众舆论的纷纷谴责。
    雅林已经在十二月三十日到塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚。他将去纽约向联合国秘书长吴丹汇报他在中东活动的情况。
