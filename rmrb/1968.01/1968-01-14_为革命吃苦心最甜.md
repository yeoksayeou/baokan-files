A machine gunner from a certain landing ship squadron, He Yongsheng, who has been awarded the First-Class Merit Citation, talks about the philosophy of suffering and joy. The most fundamental question is for whom one suffers and why one suffers. The Chinese Khrushchev said: "Those party members who suffer first and enjoy later are our good party members. Although they may suffer some personal losses in certain enjoyments, they are, or will eventually be, trusted and respected by us and the masses. In other words, they are the most worthy ones." It turns out that the "suffering" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about is merely a means to seize personal fame and realize personal ambition. His temporary "suffering" is to gain the trust and respect of everyone. In a word, "suffering" is for his own promotion and wealth. What is this if not the thorough and thorough bourgeois philistine philosophy of "suffering a little to gain a lot"?

Our revolutionary soldiers' proletarian philosophy of suffering and joy is completely opposite to the reactionary philosophy of suffering and joy of the Chinese Khrushchev. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary troops. Our troops are completely for the liberation of the people and work thoroughly for the interests of the people." Struggling for the happiness of all the people in the country and for the liberation of all mankind is our greatest joy. Our sailors patrol day and night on the seas of our motherland, feeling no hardship when seasick and vomiting, and only joy when eating and sleeping in the open. We suffer for the revolution, for the people, for the sake of "public" interests. My comrades often say: "Compared to the Red Army eating tree bark and belts, compared to the volunteers eating a handful of fried noodles and a handful of snow, our hardships are nothing!" "For the sake of the three-tenths of the world's people who are not yet liberated, we are willing to suffer to death."

In our revolutionary soldiers' philosophy of suffering and joy, there is only "public" and no "private." With a "public" spirit, the more difficult the place, the more we want to go, the more difficult it is, the sweeter it is. On our ship, there is a saying: "The more you suffer, the more you contribute to the revolution," "For the revolution, the more you suffer, the sweeter it is." With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we not only spiritually overcome any difficulty but also find ways to conquer it. Sometimes, when we are on a mission at sea, we have no fresh water, so we cook noodles with seawater. Everyone not only does not feel bitter but also happily says: "This is the highest level of noodles in the world, and you can only enjoy it by going to the sea to revolutionize!" "We eat seawater noodles for the revolution, it's bitter in the mouth but sweet in the heart." The Chinese Khrushchev, with his bourgeois decayed worldview, how can he understand the lofty philosophy of suffering and joy of revolutionary soldiers!

The Chinese Khrushchev peddles reactionary philosophy of suffering and joy, intending to make everyone become selfish and self-serving. This is completely a foolish fantasy. We are determined to take "Criticize Revisionism, Repudiate Self" as the key link, study Chairman Mao's works extensively, and launch a revolution in our minds, thoroughly repudiate "private" interests, thoroughly establish "public" interests, and uproot revisionism, so that Mao Zedong Thought can deeply take root in our minds. We will bury the reactionary philosophy of suffering and joy of the Chinese Khrushchev at the bottom of the sea!

    为革命吃苦心最甜
    某登陆舰大队机枪兵、一等功荣立者  何永生
    谈到苦乐观，最根本的问题是为谁吃苦，为什么吃苦。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“那些吃苦在前，享福在后的党员，是我们的好党员，虽然在某些个人享受上，他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的，也就是说，他们是最值得的。”原来中国赫鲁晓夫所谓
  “吃苦”，只是掠取个人名利、实现个人野心的手段，他的暂时“吃苦”，就是为了个人受到大家“信任”、“尊敬”。一句话，“吃苦”是为了自己升官发财。这不是彻头彻尾的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级市侩哲学又是什么？
    我们革命战士的无产阶级苦乐观同中国赫鲁晓夫的反动苦乐观完全是相反的。毛主席教导我们：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”为全国人民的幸福、为全人类的解放而奋斗，就是我们的最大快乐。我们水兵日夜巡逻在祖国的海洋上，晕船呕吐不叫苦，餐风露宿只觉乐。我们吃苦，就是为革命，为人民，为了一个“公”字。我的战友们常说：“比比红军吃树根皮带，比比志愿军一把炒面，一把雪，我们这点苦算什么？”“为了世界上三分之二未解放的人民，苦死也心甘。”
    在我们革命战士的苦乐观中，只有“公”字，没有“私”字。有了一个“公”字，越是艰苦的地方越要去，愈是困难愈觉甜。在我们舰上，流传着一句口头语：“多吃一分苦，对革命就多一分贡献”，“为革命，愈是吃苦心愈甜”。有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装，我们对任何困难不但精神上能压倒它，而且能想办法克服它。有时我们在海上执行任务，没有淡水，就用海水煮面条。大家不仅不觉苦，还津津有味地说：“这是世界上最高级的面条，不到大海上干革命还享受不到呢！”“我们为革命吃海水面条，是苦在嘴里，甜在心里。”中国赫鲁晓夫满脑子资产阶级的腐朽世界观，他怎么能理解革命战士的高尚的苦乐观呢！
    中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖反动的苦乐观，就是想使人们都成为自私自利的小人。这完全是痴心妄想。我们下定决心要以“斗私，批修”为纲，大学大用毛主席著作，在自己头脑里爆发革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大挖修根，让毛泽东思想在我们头脑里深深扎根。我们要把中国赫鲁晓夫的反动苦乐观，葬入海底！
