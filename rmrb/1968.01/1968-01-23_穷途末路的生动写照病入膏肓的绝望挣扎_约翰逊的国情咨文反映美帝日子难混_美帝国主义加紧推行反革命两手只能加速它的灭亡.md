In the face of repeated failures in the Vietnam War, the deepening development of the people's anti-war movement and black people's struggle against violence, worsening fiscal and economic conditions, and intense infighting within the ruling class, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, presented his State of the Union address to Congress on January 17. This address reveals that American imperialism is in a rapidly deteriorating situation of internal and external difficulties, finding itself at a loss and helpless. At the same time, it also shows that American imperialism is still trying to struggle desperately, aggressively pushing forward its policy of aggression abroad and intensifying its oppression and exploitation of the American people at home.

Johnson, in a low and gloomy tone, admitted in the address that American imperialism "is facing challenges both at home and abroad." Regarding the numerous problems listed in the address, American bourgeois politicians and American and Western bourgeois newspapers generally believe that Johnson did not propose any practical solutions. They say that the address shows Johnson is "extremely irritated" and "remarkably dull." He raised a lot of difficulties but "did not propose any real solutions."

When talking about the shameful failure of the U.S. "war and peace" two-pronged policy in Vietnam last year, Johnson emphasized that the U.S. is "determined" to "persist" with this counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy, continuing to struggle in the dead end of "war and peace." This indicates that the U.S. government, in order to deal with this year's elections, is actively planning to intensify and expand the war in Vietnam while colluding with the Soviet revisionists, the Vatican, and all reactionaries to play the "peace talk" trick, aiming to gain breathing room and reverse the defeat on the battlefield.

Johnson's State of the Union address this year was also presented in the context of escalating contradictions among imperialist countries. In the past month, the capitalist world has been hit by a series of major events, including the devaluation of the British pound, the dollar crisis, and Britain's forced announcement to withdraw its colonial troops from Southeast Asia and the Middle East ahead of schedule. These events reflect the deepening crisis and intensifying contradictions in the capitalist world. The major imperialist countries in the West, especially the U.S. and Britain, are in dire straits, barely able to save themselves.

Johnson deliberately avoided some particularly thorny issues facing the U.S., such as relations with major Western European allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This precisely shows that the U.S. is helpless and speechless in the face of the accelerating disintegration of the imperialist camp.

Facing a hopeless situation, Johnson expressed his intention to strengthen the global counter-revolutionary collusion with the Soviet revisionists that was further formed after his meeting with Soviet leader Kosygin in Glassboro last June. He emphasized that during that meeting, the U.S. and the Soviet Union "had a clearer understanding of each other's positions" and boasted about the "progress" made in their collusion. He particularly pointed out that he was "very encouraged" by the "progress" made in the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" signed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to push for nuclear hegemony, nuclear blackmail, and incite anti-China sentiments.

This shows that, in the face of the surging revolutionary armed struggles of the people around the world and the accelerating disintegration of the imperialist camp, the U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, which are in unprecedented isolation, are becoming more blatant in their collusion, relying on each other, and acting in cahoots.

While advocating for strengthening the U.S.-Soviet collusion, Johnson also rabidly attacked China, viciously slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This shows that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China makes U.S. imperialism both hateful and fearful. In the face of the surging revolutionary struggles of the people around the world, the U.S. and the Soviet Union's collusion against China exposes their weakness and panic.

When discussing domestic issues, Johnson revealed that his so-called "Great Society" plan has completely failed. American society is increasingly rotting, filled with various irreconcilable contradictions. Facing a series of problems such as worsening economic, fiscal, and financial situations, rising prices, the precarious position of the dollar, the expanding basic unemployment queue, and the deepening development of the American people's opposition to the Vietnam War and black people's struggle against violence, Johnson, despite his best efforts, could not propose any effective solutions in his address. To expand the war in Vietnam and intensify political and economic attacks on the American people, Johnson proposed that the budget expenditure for the fiscal year starting July 1 will reach an unprecedented high of $185 billion. He also asked Congress to further pass tax increase bills to make up for the sharp increase in fiscal spending. He also proposed to increase the number of FBI agents and provide the "most advanced technology" to American police to strengthen fascist rule and more brutally suppress the American people. Johnson's measures will undoubtedly further intensify the already sharp class contradictions within the country.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano." Johnson's State of the Union address is a vivid depiction of the current predicament of U.S. imperialism. No matter how desperately U.S. imperialism struggles, facing internal and external difficulties, it cannot save itself from its predicament. On the contrary, it can only accelerate its own demise.

    穷途末路的生动写照病入膏肓的绝望挣扎
    约翰逊的国情咨文反映美帝日子难混
    美帝国主义加紧推行反革命两手只能加速它的灭亡
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越战争迭遭失败，人民反战运动和黑人抗暴斗争深入发展，财政经济日益恶化，统治集团内部激烈争吵的情况下，美帝国主义头子约翰逊十七日向国会提出了国情咨文。这个咨文表明，美帝国主义内外交困的窘境正在急剧恶化，处于一筹莫展、束手无策的境地；同时也表明，美帝国主义仍在力图作垂死挣扎，对外大肆推行侵略政策，对内加紧压迫和剥削美国人民。
    约翰逊在咨文里以低沉的调子和阴暗的心情承认，美帝国主义“在国内外都受到了挑战”。对于咨文里列举的许多问题，美国资产阶级政客和美国以及西方资产阶级报刊普遍认为，约翰逊没有提出任何切实的解决办法。他们说，咨文表明约翰逊“异常烦躁”，“惊人的沉闷”。他提出了一大堆困难，但“没有提出真正的解决办法”。
    约翰逊在谈到去年一年遭到可耻破产的美国战“和”两手的侵越政策时，强调美国“决心”把这一反革命两手政策“坚持下去”，继续在战、“和”两手的死胡同里挣扎。这表明，美国政府为了应付今年的大选，在积极策划强化和扩大侵越战争的同时，要勾结苏修、梵蒂冈教皇和一切反动派，加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局，以便争取喘息时间，挽救战场上的败局。
    约翰逊今年的国情咨文也是在帝国主义国家之间的矛盾日益激化的情况下提出的。在去年底和今年初的一个多月时间内，资本主义世界接连受到英镑贬值、美元危机、英帝被迫宣布提前从东南亚和中东地区撤走殖民军等一连串重大事件的冲击。这些事件反映了资本主义世界的危机在深化，矛盾在加剧。西方各主要帝国主义国家面临重重困难，特别是美国和英国，更是泥菩萨过河，自身难保。
    约翰逊在咨文里有意回避了美国所面临的一些十分棘手的问题，如美国同西欧各主要盟国的关系、北大西洋集团等问题。这正说明美国对帝国主义阵营的加速分崩离析，束手无策，有苦难言。
    面对着穷途末路的处境，约翰逊表示要加强去年六月他在葛拉斯堡罗同苏修头目柯西金会谈后进一步形成的美苏全球反革命大勾结。他强调，在那次会谈中，美苏“对我们各自的立场有了较清楚的了解”，并且吹嘘美苏勾结取得了“进展”。他特别指出，对于美苏为了推行核霸权、核讹诈政策和煽动反华而在缔结“防止核扩散”条约方面取得的“进展”，“感到很鼓舞”。
    这表明，在世界人民革命武装斗争日益高涨，帝国主义阵营加速分崩离析的形势下，处于空前孤立的美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团，越来越露骨地勾结在一起，相依为命，狼狈为奸。
    约翰逊在鼓吹加强美苏勾结的同时，还猖狂反华，恶毒攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命。这说明，震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，使美帝国主义恨得要死，怕得要命。在世界人民革命斗争空前高涨的大好形势下，美苏加紧勾结反华，这正好暴露了它们的虚弱和恐慌。
    约翰逊在谈到国内问题时表明，他所鼓吹的“伟大社会”计划，已经彻底破产。美国的社会正在日益腐烂下去，充满着各种无法克服的矛盾。面对着经济、财政、金融情况日趋恶化，物价不断上涨，美元地位岌岌可危，基本失业队伍日益扩大，美国人民反对侵越战争和黑人抗暴斗争的深入发展等一连串问题，约翰逊尽管煞费苦心，但在他的咨文中提不出任何有效的解决办法。为了扩大侵越战争和加紧在政治和经济方面向美国人民进攻，约翰逊提出在今年七月一日开始的财政年度里，预算开支将达到一千八百五十亿美元的空前高峰。他还要求国会进一步通过增税法案，以弥补财政开支的急剧增加。他还提出要增加联邦调查局的特务，向美国的警察提供“最先进的技术”，以加强法西斯统治，更疯狂地镇压美国人民。约翰逊的这些措施，必将使日趋尖锐的国内阶级矛盾进一步激化。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”约翰逊的国情咨文正是美帝国主义当前狼狈处境的生动写照。处于内外交困的美帝国主义无论怎样垂死挣扎，都无法挽救它的困境，相反，只能加速它的灭亡。
