Vietnam's cultural and artistic endeavors in the North have continued to develop under the harsh conditions of war, making significant contributions to the struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation.

Last year, the publishing sector's extensive workforce, fueled by deep hatred for American imperialism, fought while producing, releasing a large number of publications in service of the anti-American, national salvation struggle. Among these, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's articles and poetry collections greatly inspired the masses. Northern cultural workers went to the frontlines, creating many works rich with a fighting spirit that were beloved by the people. Additionally, books introducing production experiences and scientific knowledge played an active role in promoting local production.

To adapt to the war environment, many departments organized various mobile teams to go deep into the masses and directly serve them. The cultural relics management department organized mobile exhibitions to tour various places, conducting revolutionary traditional education for the masses. The film department organized hundreds of mobile film projection teams, braving mountains and rivers, and overcoming difficulties to bring films to the frontlines shrouded in gunpowder smoke and to combat units deep in the mountains and forests.

Despite the intense battles and production demands, cultural activities among the northern masses continued to flourish. Last year, various art performances were organized in different places. Most of the performances were written by the masses based on their own battles and production experiences, making them lively, vibrant, and rich in practical educational significance.

The mass reading movement also received widespread attention. According to statistics, the book "Mother with a Gun" has already been read by five million people. Other books, such as those praising heroes, are eagerly read by the masses with deep patriotic fervor, and they receive profound education from them.

    越南文化事业为抗美斗争作出贡献
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南北方的文化艺术事业，在艰苦的战争条件下继续获得发展，并为抗美救国斗争作出了重要的贡献。
    去年，出版部门的广大职工，怀着对美帝国主义的深仇大恨，边战斗、边生产，出版了大量为抗美救国斗争服务的书刊。其中胡志明主席的文章和诗集，给了广大群众以极大的鼓舞。北方的文艺工作者深入前线，创作的许多富有战斗气息的作品，受到了群众的喜爱。此外，有关介绍生产经验和科学知识的书籍，对促进各地的生产也起了积极的作用。
    为了适应战争环境，许多部门组织各种流动小组深入群众直接为群众服务。文物保管部门组织了流动文物展览到各地巡回展出，对群众进行革命传统教育。电影部门组织了数百个电影放映队，爬山涉水，不避艰险，把影片送到硝烟弥漫的前线和深山密林里的战斗单位。
    尽管战斗和生产十分紧张，北方的群众文化活动仍然蓬勃发展。去年，各地都组织了各种文艺汇演，演出的节目大部分是群众根据自己的战斗和生产而编写的，不仅生动活泼，而且富有现实教育意义。
    群众性的读书运动也受到了普遍的重视。据统计，仅《拿枪的母亲》一书就已有五百万人阅读。其他如歌颂英雄人物等书籍，群众都怀着深厚的爱国主义热情争相阅读，并从中受到深刻的教育。
