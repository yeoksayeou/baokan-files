Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent a telegram on January 17 to the patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province, warmly commending their glorious victory in liberating Nam Pao on January 14.

The telegram said, "The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front highly praises the great victory at Nam Pao. This great victory has shattered the plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to use Nam Pao as a 'springboard' to devour the entire Upper Laos liberation area and expand their aggressive war against Laos and the entire Indochina. This great victory demonstrates the great power of our military and civilians. It will be recorded in the glorious annals of our nation."

The telegram called on the patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province to always be vigilant, resolutely eliminate the enemy, and firmly defend the liberation area.

The Pathet Lao Radio Station issued a commentary on January 17, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province in the Nam Pao area.

The commentary pointed out: This victory has dealt a heavy blow to the stubborn and arrogant enemies invading the liberation area, shattering the plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to use Nam Pao as a base and springboard for attacking and destroying the Upper Laos liberation area.

The commentary said, The great victory at Nam Pao demonstrates the great power of the people's war under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and the high patriotism and fearless fighting spirit of the patriotic military and civilians in the Nam Pao area.

The commentary concluded, The victory of the patriotic military and civilians in the Nam Pao area will greatly inspire the entire nation to achieve even greater victories in 1968.

The brave patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province, on the night of January 14, while inflicting a heavy defeat on the rightist Lao military in the Nam Pao area, also launched a fierce attack on the Luang Prabang airport, destroying and damaging several U.S. aggressor aircraft.

This was the third attack on the Luang Prabang airport by the Lao patriotic military and civilians since February 2, 1967. In these three attacks, the Lao patriotic military and civilians have destroyed nearly 30 U.S. aircraft, burned nearly 150 tons of fuel and ammunition, and annihilated hundreds of enemy troops.

The Pathet Lao News Agency issued a statement on January 12, refuting the recent slander by the Thai reactionary clique that there were Pathet Lao troops active in the northern province of Nan. The statement said, This is a groundless slander and fabrication by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao People's Liberation Army. The statement warned U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas reactionary clique: If they persist in their aggressive and traitorous activities, they will inevitably face punishment from the Thai people.
