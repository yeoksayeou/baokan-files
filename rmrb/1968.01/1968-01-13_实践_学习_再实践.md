Editor's Note: Currently, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering the entire country. They are held in cities, rural areas, factories, and communes, and even in families. The forms are diverse, making it a great school for the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

How to run the study classes better? How to fully carry forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, based on Marxism-Leninism? In this regard, various places have many good experiences. We have decided to open this column to facilitate the exchange of experiences among revolutionary rebels and revolutionary comrades, so that we can jointly improve the study classes.

How to overcome the phenomenon of "learning and then returning to work with a burst of enthusiasm, but after a while, it's all in vain"? The experience of Qingdao Steel Plant in running study classes is:

Practice · Study · Practice Again

The surging tide of the Cultural Revolution has pushed some ordinary workers from the production front line of Qingdao Steel Plant to revolutionary leadership positions. Due to our lack of struggle experience, we cannot quickly adapt to the current struggle needs. What should we do? Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we held several study classes, but the results were not ideal. Some people said: "In the study class, it sounds good, but after returning to work, it's just a burst of enthusiasm, and after a while, it's all in vain." Theory and practice are not combined. With the help of the army, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and deeply felt that the main problem is that we have not focused on the "use" aspect. We are determined to combine learning with application, bringing problems from practice back to study, and practicing again based on improved understanding, continuously summarizing and improving.

The specific method is to study for seven or eight days, then go deep into the workshops to work alongside the workers, study together, expose thoughts, fight against selfishness, seek opinions, and listen to criticism; after a period of practice, return to the study class to summarize experiences, improve understanding, and then return to the workshop to practice.

For example, in our factory's rolling mill, although organizational unity has been achieved, the ideological unity is not yet solidified. The revolutionary committee of the workshop and the leaders of the revolutionary organizations, in their first study class, learned Chairman Mao's latest instructions and realized that the rebels are in power, standing on the main side of the contradiction, and only by first exposing and fighting against selfishness can they do a good job in the ideological and political work of the masses. However, once they left the study class, in practice, the "selfishness" popped up again. They were afraid that exposing selfishness would lose the trust of the masses, lose authority, and be unable to work. Therefore, they only exposed the phenomena, not the essence. As a result, although some work was done, the effect was not significant. After they returned to the study class for the second time, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions again in relation to this problem and their own practice, further realizing that: without overthrowing selfishness, practice cannot be carried out.

This makes us realize that there is a gap between a person's understanding and practice, and this gap is pulled apart by selfishness. We must fight against selfishness in the study class and even more so in practice. Only through repeated study and practice can we gradually solve problems and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

专栏：

    编者按：目前，毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及全国，城市办，农村办，工厂办，公社办，甚至家庭也在办，形式多样，成为广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    怎样把学习班办得更好？怎样充分发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风？在这方面各地有很多好经验。我们决定开辟这一专栏，以便无产阶级革命派和广大革命同志交流经验，共同把学习班办得好上加好。
    怎样克服“学完回去一阵风，日子长了一场空”的现象？青岛钢厂办学习班的经验是：
    实践·学习·再实践
    无产阶级文化大革命的激流，把我们青岛钢厂原来在生产第一线上的一些普通工人，推上了革命的领导地位。由于我们缺乏斗争经验，还不能很快适应当前斗争的需要。怎么办？遵照毛主席的教导，我们开办了几期学习班，但效果并不理想。有的人说：“在学习班说得很好听，学完回去一阵风，日子长了一场空。”理论和实践不结合。在解放军的帮助下，我们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，深深感到主要是没有在“用”字上狠下功夫。我们决心把学与用很好地结合起来，带着实践中的问题再学习，在提高认识的基础上再实践，不断总结，不断提高。
    具体办法是，学习七、八天后，深入班组跟班劳动，再和职工一起学习，亮思想，斗私字，征求意见，听取批评；经过一段实践，再回到学习班，总结经验，提高认识，然后再回到车间去实践。
    如我厂轧钢车间，虽然在组织上实现了大联合，但思想上还不巩固。车间革委会和革命组织负责人，第一次进学习班学习了毛主席的最新指示，认识到造反派掌了权，处于矛盾的主要方面，只有首先亮私斗私，才能做好群众的思想政治工作。但是，他们一出了学习班，在实践中，“私”字又一下子蹦了出来，怕亮了私，群众不信任，失掉威信，无法工作。因此，亮私只亮现象，不亮本质。结果，尽管做了一些工作，效果不大。他们第二次回到学习班以后，针对着这个问题，又反复学习毛主席的教导，结合自己的实践，进一步认识到：私字不倒，实践不了。
    这就使我们认识到，人的认识和实践是有一段距离的，这段距离就是私字给拉开的。学习班中要斗私，实践中要更进一步斗私，反复学习，反复实践，才能逐步解决问题，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
