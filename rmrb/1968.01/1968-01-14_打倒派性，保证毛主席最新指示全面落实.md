The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the key to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, in some places, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has hindered the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a crucial step in achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao has called for revolutionary mass organizations to "unite in revolutionary principles to achieve revolutionary great unity." However, some people are full of factionalism, shouting slogans of unity but actually obstructing it. If their faction is strong, they will try every means to crush the opposition; if they are weak, they will rack their brains to expand their forces. When they are forced to unite by the masses, they will argue endlessly over "seats." If their demands for seats are not met, they will split off and form another "mountain stronghold." This obstructs the achievement of revolutionary great unity.

Chairman Mao instructs: "Correctly handling the issue of cadres is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit." However, those blinded by factionalism do not adhere to revolutionary principles, do not analyze cadres from a class perspective, and do not distinguish right from wrong. They support cadres who support them, considering them all good and integrating them all; they oppose cadres who do not support them, considering them all bad and overthrowing them all. They protect cadres opposed by others and persecute cadres protected by others. Some people have forgotten Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "handle the cadre issue by starting from education and expanding the scope of education," adopting an attitude of general suspicion and overthrowing everyone. This obstructs the achievement of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches the two sides to "make more self-criticisms, seek common ground while reserving differences." However, those with factionalism attribute merits to themselves and push errors onto others. They often use a microscope to find others' faults, magnifying trivial matters. Regarding their own faults and errors, they downplay them. Some even deliberately reverse right and wrong, turning faults into merits, errors into achievements, and criticism from superiors into praise. It seems that truth is always on their side, and whatever they say is right. Thus, "common ground" is completely abandoned, and "differences" are magnified beyond control. "Verbal battles" never stop, and "armed struggles" follow. This seriously disrupts the direction of the struggle.

In summary, with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, one cannot see the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought, cannot keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and cannot implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Not taking the right path but the wrong one will inevitably lead to falling into the mire of error and being unable to extricate oneself.

As people say, factionalism is like a poisonous snake that can strangle, bite, and poison people. If we do not overthrow factionalism and cut off this poisonous snake, our revolutionary cause cannot continue to advance, and some of our comrades will be in danger of being "bitten to death."

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an inflated form of individualism. Those infected with factionalism, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "only see partial interests and not the overall interests," and "place personal interests first and revolutionary interests second." Therefore, their worldview is still a kingdom of "self," and they cannot deeply understand and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which represent the interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. Although they emphasize implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions verbally, in reality, their words and deeds do not match, and they cannot implement them.

The New Year's Day editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* in 1968 pointed out: "Whether one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a genuine proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." Therefore, every proletarian revolutionary fighter must take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, use the "Old Five Articles" as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and firmly establish the proletarian "public." Drive factionalism out the door, let party spirit settle in, and wage a decisive battle against bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements in the depths of the soul.

All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary mass organizations determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end must unite, overthrow factionalism, ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 打倒派性，保证毛主席最新指示全面落实

    打倒派性，保证毛主席最新指示全面落实
    柳松
      “毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。”但是，有些地方，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性却阻碍了毛主席最新指示的全面落实。因此，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要关键。
    毛主席号召革命群众组织“要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”。而有些人却派性十足，口里高喊联合，实际上却在阻碍联合。如果他那一派人多势众，就想方设法整垮对方；如果人少势寡，就绞尽脑汁，扩充人马。当他们在群众的推动下，不得不联合的时候，又在“席位”问题上争论不休。如果“席位”不能满足欲望，便拉出一派，另立“山头”。这样就阻碍了革命大联合的实现。
    毛主席指示：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”而被派性蒙住了眼睛的人，却不讲革命原则，对干部不作阶级分析，不问是非曲直，支持他的干部，都是好的，统统结合；不支持他的干部，都是坏的，统统打倒。别人反对的干部，他故意保护起来；别人保护的干部，他偏要揪斗。有的人将毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的最新指示忘于脑后，采取一概怀疑，一概打倒的态度。这样就阻碍了革命三结合的实现。
    毛主席教导两派“各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”。而有派性的人却把功劳记在自己的账上，将错误推给别人。他们常常用显微镜去寻找人家的缺点，抓住一些鸡毛蒜皮，无限上纲。对于自己的缺点错误，却大事化小，小事化了。甚至有人故意颠倒黑白，把缺点说成成绩，把错误化为功劳，把上级的批评说成是对他的表扬，好象真理永远在他一边，怎么说都是他有理。于是，“大同”被抛弃得干干净净，“小异”被扩大得难以收拾。“舌战”不停，加以“武斗”。这样就严重地干扰了斗争大方向。
    总而言之，有了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就看不见毛泽东思想这个伟大真理，就跟不上毛主席伟大战略部署，就执行不了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。正路不走走歪路，必然会滑到错误的泥坑里不能自拔。
    正如人们所说，派性象一条毒蛇，它能够缠死人，咬死人，毒死人。不打倒派性，不斩断这条毒蛇，我们的革命事业就不能继续前进，我们有些同志就有被“咬死”的危险。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是放大了的个人主义。染上了派性的人，正如毛主席指出的，“只看见局部利益，不看见全体利益”，“以个人利益放在第一位，革命利益放在第二位”。因此，他们的世界观还是一个“私”字的王国，对于毛主席的代表无产阶级和广大革命群众利益的最新指示，不能深刻领会，坚决照办。他们尽管在口头上也强调要按毛主席最新指示办事，但实际上言行不一，落实不了。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”因此，每个无产阶级革命战士必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”为武器，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，将派性扫地出门，让党性安家落户，在灵魂深处打一场灭资兴无的胜仗。
    一切决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派和革命群众团结起来，打倒派性，保证毛主席最新指示全面落实，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而斗争！
