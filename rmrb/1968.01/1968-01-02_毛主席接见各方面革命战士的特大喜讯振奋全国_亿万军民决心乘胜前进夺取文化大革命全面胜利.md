The great news of Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary comrades from all sides has inspired the entire nation. Hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel are determined to advance and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The entire nation's military and civilian personnel have launched a wave of studying the New Year's Day editorial of 1968, expressing their resolve to better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the new year, to unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to be models in learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They are determined to make new contributions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received comrades participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and revolutionary comrades from all sides. The publication of the New Year's Day editorial "Welcome the Comprehensive Victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution" by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily has greatly inspired, encouraged, educated, and urged the proletarian revolutionary factions and broad masses of revolutionary people across the country. They enthusiastically shouted in thousands of voices: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Revolutionary masses in various places have expressed that the important editorial "Welcome the Comprehensive Victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution" is a new great battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to the entire Party, the entire army, the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country, and the people of the entire country. We must turn Chairman Mao's warm concern into an immense force. In the new year, we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and with great enthusiasm and determination, strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

The great news of Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary comrades from various places has spread across the country, and the people are overjoyed. From the Tibetan Plateau to within the Great Wall, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the shores of the South China Sea, the shouts of "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" echo through the skies. In the streets of the capital, revolutionary masses beat drums and set off firecrackers, pasting up one red joyous bulletin after another throughout the night, celebrating Chairman Mao's reception as a great encouragement and inspiration to the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses across the country. In Shanghai, many units of the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses immediately took to the streets to celebrate and report the good news to the revolutionary people of the entire city. The broad masses of the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters" excitedly said: The great leader Chairman Mao cares most about the revolutionary masses and is always with us heart to heart. Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary comrades from all sides has given us even greater confidence and strength to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in 1968. More than twenty thousand revolutionary comrades who were warmly received by the great leader Chairman Mao, with hearts full of excitement and happiness, eagerly conveyed the great news of Chairman Mao's reception to the broad revolutionary people. The preparatory committee of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee and some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations returned to Nanchang immediately after seeing Chairman Mao, telling the good news to the people of the entire province. They excitedly said, our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, received us in his busy schedule, which is the greatest encouragement, education, motivation, and care for the people of the country and Jiangxi. We, the children of Jinggangshan, must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and turn Jiangxi into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. Representatives attending the meeting on the publication of Chairman Mao's works in Beijing were immersed in boundless happiness that night. They said, Chairman Mao's reception has given us boundless encouragement and strength. We must resolutely carry out the great battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao in the New Year's Day editorial to the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, ensure the printing of more revolutionary classics, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over the entire country and the world!

Under the inspiration of the great news of Chairman Mao's reception, proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses across the country have launched a wave of studying the New Year's Day editorial, determined to better comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary committees or preparatory committees of revolutionary committees in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Guizhou, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Gansu, Sichuan, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have held meetings of the standing committee of the revolutionary committee or meetings of members of the preparatory committee of the revolutionary committee to study and discuss the New Year's Day editorial. Some have organized discussions with leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations overnight, some have held telephone conferences, and some have issued notices, calling on the broad revolutionary masses to immediately launch a wave of extensive study, discussion, propaganda, and implementation of the New Year's Day editorial.

The notice issued by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee today emphasized that through the study of the New Year's Day editorial, the broad revolutionary masses must definitely organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, launch a more extensive and in-depth mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and first of all, learn and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution well. Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented item by item and comprehensively, resolutely carried out, and followed word for word. The preparatory committee of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee held an emergency telephone conference for the entire province late on the 31st, calling on the people of the entire province to take the study of the New Year's Day editorial as the top priority at present. The emergency notice issued at the meeting requires members of the revolutionary committees (preparatory committees) and temporary leading groups at all levels, military leaders, to first take the lead in studying well and immediately go to the grassroots to propagate to the masses; leading organs at all levels and revolutionary mass organizations must concentrate their efforts to organize the masses to study, and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must set an example in learning; various forms must be used to vigorously propagate, making the spirit of the editorial known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts; learning must be combined with practice, studying while doing; leading organs at all levels and revolutionary mass organizations must use the method of one divides into two, realistically check work, summarize experience, and implement measures and deployments.

The entire standing committee of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee studied and discussed the New Year's Day editorial until late at night on the 31st, and everyone felt that the more they studied, the clearer their minds and the more energetic they became. They expressed that in the new year, they must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. The standing committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held consecutive standing committee meetings on the 31st and 1st, deciding to immediately launch extensive study, propaganda, and implementation of the New Year's Day editorial throughout the autonomous region, advance and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in the new year, and turn the frontline post of anti-revisionism, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Many places' proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses have been studying while taking action, demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." Nearly ten thousand revolutionary masses from the two major factions in Baoding, Hebei, held a "Promote the Great Unity of Revolutionary Factions Pledge Rally" today, expressing their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly achieve the great unity of revolutionaries and the three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units. The Revolutionary Committee of the Xinyang Region, Henan Province, inspired by the New Year's Day editorial, decided to start Mao Zedong Thought study classes ahead of schedule, letting Chairman Mao's latest instructions be implemented immediately. In the evening before the New Year, the Revolutionary Committee of the Benxi Coal Mine in Liaoning Province, which was established, conveyed the spirit of the editorial to the workers fighting on the coal mining frontline, and worked with them in the mine. All members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guiyang Cotton Mill went to the workshops today to work with the workers and study the New Year's Day editorial, determined to achieve greater harvests in revolution and production in 1968. In the historic city of Zunyi, more than ten thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards held a pledge rally. Broad revolutionary masses determined to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and achieve more brilliant victories in 1968.

Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on the last day of 1967 when the proletarian cultural revolution achieved decisive victories, received comrades participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and revolutionary comrades from all sides. The publication of the New Year's Day editorial "Welcome the Comprehensive Victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution" by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily has greatly inspired the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have made tremendous contributions in the proletarian cultural revolution. Broad cadres and soldiers have expressed with revolutionary enthusiasm that in 1968, they must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, achieve new merits for the country and the people.

In the capital, military camps have been filled with the sound of drums and cheers from last night to tonight. The leadership organs and troops of various departments, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, various military branches, and the Beijing Garrison Command have been overjoyed and spreading the news since they heard the news. Many units have held celebration meetings and parades overnight. Last night, soldiers who had the honor of seeing our great leader Chairman Mao were even more excited, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" over and over again, and singing "The East is Red" and "The Great Ship Sails with the Helm" over and over again. Comrades from the National Defense Science and Technology Commission and many other units who saw Chairman Mao returned to their units and quickly conveyed the great news of Chairman Mao's good health to their comrades and families. Many comrades wrote big-character posters, wrote resolutions, wrote articles, and wrote diaries to express their boundless loyalty, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. They said: No matter how much we sing praises, we cannot express our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. We must turn Chairman Mao's reception into a great driving force and in the new year, be models in learning, executing, propagating, and defending the latest instructions.

To quickly launch a wave of extensive and in-depth study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's Day editorial throughout the army, the military organs and troops stationed in Beijing have generally held party committee meetings overnight and issued notices or decisions, requiring subordinate troops to act immediately, swiftly, and decisively, taking the study and implementation of the New Year's Day editorial as the top political task, seriously studying, deeply understanding, extensively propagating, and resolutely implementing it.

The General Logistics Department held a celebration meeting for more than ten thousand people tonight, with the General Logistics Department leaders Qiu Huizhao, Zhang Kuming, Zhang Lingbin, Zhang Xianyue, and Zhang Tianyun attending the meeting. The leader of the Railway Corps, Luo Huasheng, lectured on the New Year's Day editorial to all cadres, soldiers, workers, and families in the headquarters today, and led more than thirty department and section-level revolutionary leading cadres to twenty construction teams to lecture on the New Year's Day editorial and discuss with the soldiers. The soldiers of the 8341st Unit of the Beijing Garrison Command, a red flag in the "three supports, two militaries" work nationwide, listened to the broadcast with the revolutionary masses last night, had a discussion, and today went deep into the workers' dormitories to propagate the spirit of the editorial to the broad workers. The first company of a certain regiment guarding Tiananmen Square also compiled a performance based on the spirit of the editorial and propagated to the broad revolutionary masses on Tiananmen Square.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Jinan, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Kunming units, and the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Regions who are fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" frontline have held discussions and study sessions after hearing the broadcast of the New Year's Day editorial. Many units have organized propaganda teams overnight, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait and the New Year's Day editorial written on large red paper, going to brother units, factories, rural areas, and urban streets to propagate Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's latest battle orders. The leaders of the Guangzhou Unit, Huang Yongsheng and Liu Xingyuan, studied the New Year's Day editorial with representatives attending the Guangzhou Unit's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works. The broad cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai and Tianjin listened to the broadcast of the New Year's Day editorial, facing the rising red sun, solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao: We must seriously study, deeply understand the spirit of the editorial, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest battle orders, and in the new year, further implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and achieve new merits for the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. The party committee members of a certain unit executing the "three supports, two militaries" task in Anhui, and leading cadres, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, five-good soldiers, and advanced individuals from the "three supports, two militaries" frontline, studied the New Year's Day editorial together, reviewed the battle course of the past year, discussed the unprecedented good situation, and celebrated the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad cadres and soldiers of the Wuhan Unit did the first thing on the first day of the new year, which was to look towards Beijing and pay tribute to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Then they turned on the radio and listened to the New Year's Day editorial again. The soldiers excitedly said: The five tasks proposed in the New Year's Day editorial are the greatest encouragement and motivation from the great leader Chairman Mao. We must implement them without any discount and ensure one hundred percent implementation. The soldiers of the "Support the Left and Love the People Model Platoon" of the 601st Unit executing the "three supports, two militaries" task in Jiangxi, after listening to the broadcast, gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and pledged: Like the heroic platoon leader Li Wentong, we will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and in the new year, we will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and fight together with the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

The broad cadres and soldiers who are vigilantly guarding the country's people to celebrate the New Year on the sea and border frontiers have been particularly moved after hearing the broadcast of the New Year's Day editorial. They sang enthusiastically: "Spring thunder roars in Beijing, the New Year's Day editorial shines brightly, Chairman Mao issues a new call, the ten thousand li rivers and mountains are bathed in morning light, the three armies cheer together, long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The Railway Corps fighting in the high-cold forest area, the soldiers of a certain supply station serving wholeheartedly for the border troops in the Kunlun Mountains, the soldiers of a certain cavalry farm under the Qilian Mountains, and the comrades of the sixth company of a certain motorized unit on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, after studying the New Year's Day editorial, all excitedly expressed that in the new year, they must better listen to Chairman Mao's words, be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and contribute greater strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. In the snow-covered forests of Changbai Mountain, the five-good soldiers Yu Tianfu, Liu Shushan, and Zhang Qing of the Shenyang Unit, who are on communication duty, listened to the broadcast by the coal-oil lamp last night, took notes carefully, and conveyed the spirit of the editorial to their comrades and commune members in remote areas overnight. This morning, before the sun rose, they put on skis, braved the wind and snow, and inspected the telephone lines to ensure that Beijing's voice is continuously transmitted to the borders of the motherland. Air Force and Navy soldiers who are vigilantly guarding the takeoff lines of the airport, high-altitude artillery positions, ships, and high-altitude observation stations, and border soldiers guarding the Himalayas, Karakorum Mountains, and the northern anti-revisionist frontline posts of the motherland, after studying the New Year's Day editorial, expressed: The new year will be the year when the proletarian cultural revolution in our country achieves a comprehensive victory. Domestic and foreign class enemies will inevitably make desperate struggles and sabotage. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, consolidate national defense, be ready to smash the enemy's war provocations at any time, defend the great motherland, and defend the proletarian cultural revolution. If the enemy dares to touch it, it will be smashed to pieces, coming in but not going out.
