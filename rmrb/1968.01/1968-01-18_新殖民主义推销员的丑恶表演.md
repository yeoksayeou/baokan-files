The beginning of the new year saw U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey leading a large entourage in a hurried visit to nine African countries. Humphrey alternately delivered impassioned speeches, "donated" dollars to win hearts and minds, and strolled through streets, putting on an act. He was entirely engaged in the activities of a new colonialism salesman.

Humphrey boasted extensively about U.S. aid to African countries, claiming that the U.S. is "dedicated to finally overcoming poverty, ignorance, malnutrition, and disease in Africa," and that the U.S. is helping "Africa move towards a life of peace, freedom, and human dignity in the coming decades."

What a benevolent and savior-like face! Using white gloves to hide his blood-stained hands, pretending to be good—this is a common trick used by imperialist robbers.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The counter-revolutionary business of the imperialist governments, although done every day, is always full of righteousness and morality in words and official documents, or at least somewhat righteous and moral, and never tells the truth."

The performance put on by the U.S. imperialist leader Humphrey in Africa is precisely this kind of shameless and hypocritical act! Does U.S. new colonialism want to "overcome poverty" in Africa? This is a blatant lie. U.S. imperialism has invested more than twenty billion dollars in Africa, plundering countless natural resources and enormous profits. According to figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which are obviously greatly reduced, the profits the U.S. squeezed out of Africa in 1964 alone exceeded 340 million dollars. The old and new colonialism led by the U.S. is the root cause of the poverty and disaster suffered by the African people. U.S. imperialism is the greatest exploiter and most greedy plunderer in Africa. Humphrey's "donation" of some U.S. "aid" this time is merely to further promote new colonialism and to carry out even more frenzied exploitation and plunder of the African people.

In fact, the so-called "overcoming poverty" trick is nothing new. The Johnson administration used it to deceive the American working people, primarily to deceive the broad masses of black people. Johnson's much-hyped "war on poverty" is actually just a trick to "declare war" on the poor and the working people.

As for the so-called "granting" of "peace, freedom, and a life of human dignity" to Africa by U.S. imperialism, it's sheer nonsense! With the support and aid of U.S. imperialism, Portuguese colonialists are slaughtering Africans. The white colonial governments in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are intensifying their brutal rule over the African people. The "United Nations forces" sent by the U.S. have left a bloody debt on the land of Congo (Kin). The traitorous Mobutu clique in Congo (Kin) is using U.S. advanced weapons to slaughter patriots and revolutionary people. U.S. imperialism has done everything to control, interfere with, overthrow, and invade African countries. It is the imperialism led by the U.S. that is killing African people every day, violating the independence and freedom of the African people, and insulting the dignity of the various peoples of Africa.

Currently, the awareness of the African people has reached an unprecedented height, and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle is deepening. Africa is a vibrant continent. Wherever Humphrey goes, the masses hold protests and demonstrations, and the roar of "Humphrey get out!" echoes across the African continent. This is the African people's resounding response to the U.S. new colonialism salesman Humphrey! In the face of the awakened African people, any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism will meet with a shameful failure.

    新殖民主义推销员的丑恶表演
    新年伊始，美国副总统汉弗莱率领大批娄罗，匆匆忙忙地到非洲九个国家进行活动。汉弗莱时而慷慨激昂地发表演说，时而“布施”美元，笼络人心，时而散步街头，装腔作势，干的完全是一个新殖民主义推销员的勾当。
    汉弗莱大肆吹嘘美国对非洲各国的“援助”，说什么美国“在非洲致力于最后战胜贫穷、无知、营养不良和疾病”，美国设法帮助“非洲在未来的年代中走向和平、自由和人类尊严的生活”。
    好一副“慈善家”和“救世主”的面孔啊！用白手套把自己的血淋淋的双手掩藏起来，假冒为善，这是帝国主义强盗惯用的伎俩。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”
    美帝国主义头目汉弗莱这次在非洲所作的，正是这种虚伪透顶、无耻透顶的表演！美国新殖民主义要在非洲“战胜贫穷”吗？这是弥天大谎。美帝国主义在非洲投资二十多亿美元，从非洲攫取数不尽的天然宝藏和惊人的利润。根据美国商务部公布的显然大大缩小了的数字，美国一九六四年从非洲榨取的利润就超过三亿四千万美元。以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，就是造成非洲人民贫困和灾难的总根源。美帝国主义是非洲最大的剥削者和最贪婪的掠夺者。汉弗莱这次在非洲“布施”了一些美“援”，也就是为了进一步推行新殖民主义，对非洲人民进行更加疯狂的榨取和掠夺而已。
    其实，所谓“战胜贫穷”的骗局，并不是什么新鲜的玩艺儿。约翰逊政府在美国国内就是用它来愚弄美国劳动人民，首先是用来愚弄广大黑人群众的。约翰逊大吹大擂的所谓“向贫穷开战”，实际上不过是“向穷人开战”、向劳动人民“开战”的一个鬼把戏。
    至于所谓美帝国主义“赐予”非洲以“和平、自由和人类尊严的生活”，更是活见鬼！葡萄牙殖民主义者在美帝国主义的支持和援助下，屠杀非洲人。南非和南罗得西亚的白人殖民政府在美帝国主义的支持下，变本加厉地加强对非洲人民的残暴统治。美国派遣的“联合国军”，在刚果（金）的土地上欠下了累累血债。刚果（金）的蒙博托卖国集团正在用美国的新式武器屠杀爱国志士和革命人民。美帝国主义对非洲国家干尽了控制、干涉、颠覆和侵略的勾当。正是以美国为首的帝国主义，天天在屠杀非洲人民，侵犯非洲人民的独立和自由，侮辱非洲各族人民的尊严。
    当前，非洲人民的觉悟空前提高，非洲人民的反帝革命斗争正在深入发展。非洲是一个生气勃勃的大陆。汉弗莱所到之处，人民群众纷纷举行抗议示威，“汉弗莱滚回去”的怒吼声响彻非洲大陆。这就是非洲人民对美国新殖民主义的推销员汉弗莱的响亮的回答！在觉醒起来的非洲人民面前，美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋都将遭到可耻的失败。
