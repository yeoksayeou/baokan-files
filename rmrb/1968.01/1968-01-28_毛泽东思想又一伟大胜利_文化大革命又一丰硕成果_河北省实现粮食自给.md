Another Great Victory for Mao Zedong Thought and Another Bountiful Fruit of the Cultural Revolution: Hebei Province Achieves Grain Self-Sufficiency

The broad masses of commune members and cadres have decided to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to continue their efforts, and to strive for sustained and stable grain production increases, making greater contributions to the country.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, January 27th: In the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hebei Province, one of the northern provinces of China that has long been short of grain, has achieved grain self-sufficiency. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." Hebei Province's achievement of grain self-sufficiency in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution once again vividly proves the complete correctness of this brilliant proposition. The broad revolutionary masses and cadres of Hebei Province emphasize that they have only achieved grain self-sufficiency for one year and that they must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, persist in putting proletarian politics in command, continue their efforts, and strive for sustained and stable grain production increases, making greater contributions to the country.

For many years, Hebei Province has been short of grain. In 1967, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the entire province directed the boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution towards production, overcame various natural disasters, and achieved a bumper harvest, thus realizing grain self-sufficiency and greatly reducing the burden on the state's grain supply.

Hebei Province's grain increase has driven the overall bumper harvest of agriculture. Last year, Hebei Province's cotton production increased by more than 30% compared to 1966; forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries also developed, and the number of pigs last year exceeded the historical record.

In the struggle to achieve grain self-sufficiency by relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of commune members and cadres in Hebei Province's rural areas have received great education. They love the great leader Chairman Mao even more, love socialism even more, and since last autumn, they have actively turned in surplus grain, cotton, and oil to the state, supporting national construction and repaying the great leader Chairman Mao.

Achieving grain self-sufficiency is a crucial issue for Hebei Province's development of the socialist economy. From the founding of New China to the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hebei Province has been engaged in a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines in solving this problem. Chairman Mao said: "Only socialism can save China." He also said: "As for agriculture, the socialist road is the only road for China's agriculture." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province have done everything they can to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and socialism. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize and unite," established cooperatives, and took the road to collective prosperity. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province maliciously slandered the establishment of cooperatives as blind adventurism and viciously slashed the cooperatives. During the period of temporary economic difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev crazily advocated "three freedoms and one contract," and his agents in Hebei Province, following his master's intentions, proposed the infamous "ten small freedoms," attempting to fully restore capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province also used the fallacies of waiting for support and relying on heaven for food to oppose Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of self-reliance and hard work; they used "work points in command" and "material incentives" to oppose Chairman Mao's instructions on political command; they used the "Peach Garden Experience" to sabotage Chairman Mao's initiated socialist education movement in the countryside. Due to the criminal activities of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province, Hebei Province's grain problem could not be solved for a long time.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle in Hebei Province's grain production. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launched a mass revolutionary criticism movement in the countryside, and thoroughly criticized all the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province that aimed at restoring capitalism.

In the revolutionary criticism movement, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hebei Province seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieved the great victory of agricultural increase and grain self-sufficiency. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, overcame droughts on more than 40 million mu of farmland, eliminated pests in more than 50 million mu of crops, drained more than 7 million mu of farmland, and finally achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton.

In the struggle to grasp the revolution and promote production, achieving grain self-sufficiency, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hebei Province's rural areas for agricultural support played a great role. They brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the countryside, passed on the "four firsts" and the "three-eight style" to the commune member masses, and the entire province's rural areas launched the activities of learning from the PLA and learning from Dazhai, further promoting the thought revolutionization of the broad masses of commune members and cadres.

Currently, Hebei Province's rural revolution and production present a great situation. Ninety percent of the communes and fifty percent of the production brigades, and the majority of the production teams in the entire province have established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with nearly four million commune members and cadres participating in the study. Through study, the broad rural cadres have further established the thought of "serving the people wholeheartedly" and are determined to achieve new merits for the people. Currently, in the vast rural areas of Hebei, a labor wave of high attendance, early attendance, and improved work efficiency has initially emerged, and various places are vigorously carrying out winter water conservancy, agricultural basic construction, and fertilizer accumulation activities, which are all in full swing.

    毛泽东思想又一伟大胜利　文化大革命又一丰硕成果
    河北省实现粮食自给
    广大社员和干部决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，争取持续地、稳定地增产粮食，为国家做出更大的贡献
    据新华社保定二十七日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，我国北方缺粮省份之一的河北省粮食自给了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”河北省在无产阶级文化大革命运动中一举实现粮食自给，又一次生动地证明了这一英明论断的完全正确。河北省的广大革命群众和革命干部强调指出，他们实现粮食自给还只是一年，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持突出无产阶级政治，再接再厉，争取持续地、稳定地增产粮食，为国家做出更大的贡献。
    多年来，河北省一直缺粮。一九六七年，全省广大贫下中农和革命干部把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用于生产，战胜了各种自然灾害，使全省的粮食产量，在一九六六年达到了历史最高水平的基础上又获得丰收，从而实现了粮食自给，大大减轻了国家粮食供应的负担。
    河北省的粮食增产带动了农业全面大丰收。去年，河北省的棉花产量，比一九六六年增产三成以上；林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业也有了发展，去年生猪数目超过了历史上的最高纪录。
    在依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，力夺粮食自给的斗争中，河北省农村广大社员、干部受到极大的教育。他们更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加热爱社会主义，去年秋收以来积极地向国家交售余粮、棉花和油料，支援国家建设，报答伟大领袖毛主席。
    实现粮食自给，这是河北省发展社会主义经济的一个极为重要的关键问题。从新中国成立到无产阶级文化大革命开始，河北省在解决这个问题上，一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。毛主席说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”又说：就农业来说，社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北的代理人，却千方百计地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对社会主义。广大贫下中农响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，大办合作社，走集体富裕的道路，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北的代理人就污蔑办合作社是盲目的冒进，恶毒地大砍合作社。在国民经济暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地鼓吹“三自一包”，中国赫鲁晓夫在河北的代理人秉承其主子的意旨，提出了臭名昭著的“十项小自由”，妄图全面复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北的代理人，还以等待支援、靠天吃饭的谬论，来对抗毛主席的奋发图强、自力更生的光辉思想；以“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”，来对抗毛主席关于政治挂帅的指示；以“桃园经验”来破坏毛主席发动的农村社会主义教育运动。由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北代理人的罪恶活动，河北省的粮食问题长期不能解决。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底揭开了河北省在粮食生产上阶级斗争的盖子。广大贫下中农和革命干部紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在农村掀起群众性的革命大批判，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北代理人的一切复辟资本主义的黑货。
    在革命大批判中，河北省的广大贫下中农和革命干部，认真活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，取得了农业增产和粮食自给的伟大胜利。广大贫下中农以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为锐利武器，去年先后战胜了四千多万亩耕地上的旱灾，消灭了五千多万亩庄稼里的虫害，排除了七百万亩农田的沥涝，终于夺得了粮棉丰收。
    在抓革命促生产，实现粮食自给的斗争中，人民解放军在河北农村担任支农任务的广大指战员，发挥了巨大作用。他们把战无不胜的毛泽东思想带到农村，把四个第一、三八作风传给社员群众，全省农村开展了大学解放军，大学大寨的活动，进一步促进了广大社员、干部的思想革命化。
    目前，河北省农村的革命和生产呈现一片大好形势。全省已有百分之九十的公社、百分之五十的生产大队和大多数生产队，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的有近四百万社员、干部。广大农村干部通过学习，进一步树立“全心全意地为人民服务”的思想，决心为人民立新功。目前，在河北广大农村，一个多出勤、早出勤、提高工效的劳动热潮，已经初步开展起来，各地冬修水利、农田基本建设和积肥等活动，正搞得热火朝天。
