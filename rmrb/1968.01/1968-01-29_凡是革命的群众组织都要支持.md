People's Liberation Army cadre Huang Dengyou and several other comrades were sent to a factory in Wuhu to carry out the task of supporting the left. Due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the two revolutionary mass organizations in this factory had been in a state of long-term division. Huang Dengyou and several other comrades helped the two revolutionary masses to take "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting selfishness" as the key link, to hold study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, and to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The antagonistic feelings between the two sides gradually dissipated, and the conditions for great unity in revolution gradually matured.

To better complete the task of supporting the left, Huang Dengyou separately sent the "Pledge to Love the People" formulated by their unit to these two organizations. After receiving the "Pledge to Love the People," a leader of one revolutionary organization thought that the PLA only supported their side and would boast to others: "The PLA supports us, we are the genuine leftists." After hearing this, Huang Dengyou thought, this is the "unique leftism" at work again, and it must be helped to free these comrades from the poison of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, so as to achieve great unity in revolution.

The next morning, Huang Dengyou was about to go find that leader, but he came to the door first and asked: "Comrade Huang, did you also send the 'Pledge to Love the People' to the other side?"

"Yes, I did."

"That's compromising, seeking a middle ground!" The leader angrily blurted out these words. Huang Dengyou calmly said:

"You know them best. They have also come out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, with their struggle always directed against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They are our class brothers. The People's Liberation Army resolutely implements the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. As long as the actions of your two revolutionary mass organizations conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will resolutely support them! Do you agree?"

Then, Huang Dengyou affectionately said: "Do you remember the situation a few days ago when we studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fighting selfishness and repudiating revisionism in the Mao Zedong Thought study class? That 'unique revolutionary' and 'unique leftist' mentality is actually the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism at work. Ultimately, it is still a matter of 'self.' The proletarian revolutionary faction implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Once they discover selfish thoughts within themselves, they must use Mao Zedong Thought to fight them fiercely and not rest until they achieve complete victory."

These words made the comrade realize his mistake. From then on, he would tell everyone: "We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to fight selfishness and repudiate revisionism, break down factionalism, and uphold Party spirit, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and achieve great unity in revolution."

    凡是革命的群众组织都要支持
    人民解放军某部管理员黄登友和另外几个同志，到芜湖的一家工厂执行支左任务。由于党内一小撮走资派的挑动，这个工厂里的两个革命群众组织长期闹分裂。黄登友等几个同志帮助两派革命群众以“斗私，批修”为纲，开办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，双方的对立情绪逐渐消除，革命的大联合条件逐步成熟。
    为了更好地完成支左任务，黄登友分别给这两个组织送去了他们部队订出的“爱民公约”。一个革命组织的负责人收到“爱民公约”后，自以为解放军只支持他们这一派，逢人就讲：“解放军是支持我们的，我们就是响当当的革命左派。”黄登友听到了这种说法以后，心想，这又是那种“唯我独左”的派性在那里作怪了，必须帮助这些同志从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的毒害中解放出来，这样才能搞好革命的大联合。
    第二天一早，黄登友正想去找那个负责人，他却先找上门来了，见面就问：“黄同志，你们给那一派也送去了‘爱民公约’吗？”
      “是呀。”
      “这是和稀泥，搞折中！”那个负责人生气地冲口说出了这么一句话。黄登友心平气和地说：
  “对他们，你是最清楚的。他们也是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中冲杀出来的，斗争矛头一直对着党内一小撮走资派，是我们的阶级兄弟。我们人民解放军坚决执行支左不支派的原则，你们这两个革命群众组织的行动，只要是符合毛主席革命路线的，我们都要坚决支持！你说对吗？”
    接着，黄登友又亲切地说：“你还记得前几天咱们在毛泽东思想学习班上学习毛主席关于要斗私，批修的最新指示的情况吗？那种‘唯我独革’、‘唯我独左’的思想，实际上都是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在作怪，归根到底还是一个‘私’字。无产阶级革命派执行毛主席的最新指示，一发现自己有私心杂念，就要用毛泽东思想狠斗猛斗，不获全胜，决不收兵。”
    这一席话，使那位同志认识到自己错了。从这以后，他逢人便讲：“我们一定要按照毛主席的最新指示斗私批修，大破派性，大立党性，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，搞好革命的大联合。”
