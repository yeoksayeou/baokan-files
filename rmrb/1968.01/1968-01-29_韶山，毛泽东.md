The radiant Shaoshan Village is the pride and glory of humanity. In a bitterly cold winter, Mao Zedong was born in this verdant mountain village. Ah! Our revolutionary red Shaoshan Village, you have nurtured a great revolutionary leader for humanity. The wheels of human history have since rolled forward a thousand miles a day!

Ah! Shaoshan, Shaoshan, you are not just the cradle of a red heart, nor merely a mother who has endured countless hardships. You are the cradle of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. You are like the most beautiful spring in the world, a torch that the world's proletariat looks up to. Your name is known throughout the five continents and four seas.

Ah! Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, the glorious Communist Party of China was founded by you. Your unparalleled wisdom has stirred up the giant waves of world revolution, surging and roaring! Your thoughts shine like the sun, illuminating the hearts of every revolutionary fighter, every Communist Party member, and the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Shaoshan, Mao Zedong, Beijing, Mao Zedong—wherever you go, a red sun rises! The hearts of revolutionary people around the world are illuminated by your golden-red flames! How inspiring it is! The great Cultural Revolution in China ensures that the socialist mountains and rivers of China will never change color! The revolutionary storm makes the enemy tremble with fear! The fleeing enemies are like bats fearing the sun.

Ah! Wise Chairman Mao, you are steering the ship of world revolution, navigating through countless reefs and breaking through towering waves, sailing towards victory. Ah! Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, I want to use the most beautiful language to praise you a million times! Even with a million songs, I cannot fully express my boundless admiration for your great thoughts!

“Waves surge and clouds roar across the four seas, winds and thunder shake the five continents.” With the revolutionary passion of the proletariat, I compose this heartfelt melody to sing your praises—Chairman Mao!
