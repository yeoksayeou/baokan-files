Leaders of the various general departments of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industrial Office, various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region held a discussion meeting, expressing their revolutionary enthusiasm as they welcomed the victorious year of 1967 and ushered in the brilliant year of 1968. They enthusiastically hailed the great leader Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary fighters and discussed the New Year's Day editorial of 1968.

*Liberation Army Daily* News: As we bid farewell to the victorious year of 1967 and welcome the brilliant year of 1968 with revolutionary enthusiasm, our greatest and dearest leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received comrades who are in Beijing attending the Mao Zedong Thought study class and representatives of the active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works from the direct units and troops of the Air Force. This is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur that the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has shown to all military and civilian personnel across the country.

On January 1, the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* published an important New Year's Day editorial, conveying Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions to the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country. It conveyed the mobilization order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Leaders from the General Staff Department, General Political Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, National Defense Industrial Office, and the Navy, Air Force, Artillery, Second Artillery, Armored Forces, Engineer Corps, Railway Corps, Signal Corps, Chemical Defense Corps, and the Beijing Military Region held a discussion meeting. With boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's reception, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They seriously studied and discussed the New Year's Day editorial, reviewed the achievements and experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions over the past year, clarified the combat tasks for the new year, and decided to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, they will redouble their efforts, strive for the forefront, and continue to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The comrades participating in the discussion meeting, with boundless enthusiasm, enthusiastically hailed the great leader Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, which achieved decisive victories in 1967! They enthusiastically hailed the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao said, "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good." The New Year's Day editorial pointed out, "The most important aspect of the excellent situation is that after Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were conveyed to the broad revolutionary masses, a wave of earnest study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions emerged among the masses." Everyone unanimously agreed that the billions of revolutionary masses, in the storm of class struggle, studied and mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is the best and most excellent situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The attendees excitedly pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was able to achieve decisive victories because we have the brilliant leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao. Everyone recalled the struggles of the past year, and at every critical moment, it was Chairman Mao who gave us the most timely, correct, and wise instructions, guiding us from victory to victory. Comrades from the General Staff Department, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, Artillery, and Railway Corps said: After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism" and the instruction that "military training classes should include soldiers," we established Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members together, improving the relationship between superiors and subordinates and promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Everyone unanimously expressed that they must thoroughly and seriously study the latest instructions, without relaxing for a single moment; implement the latest instructions comprehensively, without the slightest deviation; enthusiastically propagate the latest instructions, without the slightest interruption; and resolutely defend the latest instructions, without the slightest wavering.

The key to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is to establish a revolutionary study style and focus on the "use" aspect.

The comrades participating in the discussion said: The fundamental issue of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is to combine learning with application, to apply what is learned, to act immediately, and to establish a revolutionary study style that connects theory with practice. As emphasized in the New Year's Day editorial: "We must continue to carry forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, which is based on Marxism-Leninism. We must learn from Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, apply what we learn, deeply understand, resolutely follow, regularly check, and summarize in a timely manner."

Comrades from the Armored Forces and Engineer Corps shared their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said that every instruction and every word given by Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the guidelines and the only correct directions for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by firmly standing on the proletarian standpoint and having deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learning a little and applying a little, and focusing on the "use" aspect, can we implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively.

Comrades from the General Logistics Department and the Second Artillery Corps reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The relationship between Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese revolution is like the relationship between an arrow and a target." They said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are also like the relationship between an arrow and a target. We must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the "arrow" to hit the target of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the "arrow" to hit the target of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

Everyone firmly said that whoever implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is a true proletarian revolutionary; whoever goes against Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a revolutionary in name only.

Comrades from the Air Force and the Beijing Military Region also mentioned that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively, we must resolutely and uncompromisingly fight against all erroneous words and deeds that go against Chairman Mao's latest instructions. First, we must fight against the "self" in our minds, seize the power of the "self" in our minds, and thoroughly transform our non-proletarian worldview. Everyone expressed: In the new year, we must further implement Chairman Mao's great instruction to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and like the hero Li Wentong, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, thoroughly expose, fiercely fight against, and resolutely change the "self," smash the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public," and carry the revolution through to the end.

The comrades participating in the discussion pointed out that the New Year's Day editorial, in the new situation, has set strategic goals and combat tasks for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is a new test for the proletarian revolutionaries.

Comrades from the General Political Department and the Navy said that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively is a arduous struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish by itself." The more thoroughly Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented, the faster the enemy will perish; the better Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented, the sooner the enemy will collapse. Class enemies will definitely adopt more cunning and deceitful revolutionary strategies, openly and secretly, directly and indirectly, from the right or the ultra-"left" to interfere with and sabotage the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must have enemy awareness in our minds and see the enemy with our eyes, and use Mao Zedong Thought to expose and smash all the tricks of the class enemy, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions implemented thoroughly and comprehensively.

Comrades from the National Defense Industrial Office, Signal Corps, and Chemical Defense Corps said that we must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, take implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively as the highest criterion for all actions, and truly become "proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

The comrades participating in the discussion meeting unanimously agreed that in the new year, our army will undertake more arduous and important tasks, which is the greatest trust that the great leader Chairman Mao has placed in our army. We must be models in studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new merits for the people.

    毛主席倡导的革命学风要继续发扬永远发扬  毛主席发出的最新指示要条条落实全面落实
    解放军各总部、国防科委、国防工办、各军种兵种和北京部队领导机关的同志，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席接见革命战士，满怀革命豪情座谈一九六八年元旦社论
    《解放军报》消息：当我们满怀革命的豪情，送别胜利的一九六七年，迎接光辉灿烂的一九六八年的时候，我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，接见了正在北京参加毛泽东思想学习班的同志和空军直属机关、部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表等。这是伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席对全国军民最大最大的关怀，最大最大的鼓舞，最大最大的鞭策。
    一日，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表了元旦重要社论，向全党、全军和全国人民传达了毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，传达了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员令。
    总参谋部、总政治部、总后勤部、国防科委、国防工办和海军、空军、炮兵、第二炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵、铁道兵、通信兵、防化兵以及北京部队领导机关的部分同志举行了座谈，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的激情，热烈欢呼毛主席的接见，千遍万遍地纵情高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！他们认真学习和讨论了元旦社论，畅谈了过去一年里，贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的成绩和经验，明确了在新的一年中的战斗任务，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证
    参加座谈的同志以无比兴奋的激情，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，在一九六七年取得了决定性的胜利！热烈欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    毛主席说：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。”元旦社论指出：“形势大好最重要的一点是：伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示同广大革命群众见面以后，出现了一个群众性的认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的最新指示的热潮。”大家一致认为，亿万革命群众在阶级斗争的暴风雨里，学习和掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想，这是无产阶级文化大革命最好最好的大好形势。
    到会同志激动地指出，无产阶级文化大革命之所以能取得决定性胜利，最最根本的是我们有伟大统帅毛主席的天才领导。大家回忆了一年来的斗争，在每个关键时刻，都是毛主席他老人家给我们作了最及时、最正确、最英明的指示，指引我们从胜利走向胜利。总参谋部、国防科委、炮兵、铁道兵的同志说：毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召和“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的指示后，我们就办起了干部、战士、职工、家属在一起学习的毛泽东思想学习班，改善了上下级关系，促进了人的思想革命化。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。大家一致表示，一定要全面认真学习最新指示，一分一秒不放松；全面落实最新指示，一丝一毫不走样；热情宣传最新指示，一时一刻不间断；坚决捍卫最新指示，一生一世不动摇。
    条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示的关键，是建立革命的好学风，在“用”字上狠下功夫
    参加座谈的同志说：条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的根本问题，就是要学用结合，学了就用，闻风而动，立竿见影，建立理论联系实际的革命好学风。正如元旦社论中强调指出的：“要继续发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。对毛主席著作，对毛主席的最新指示，学了就要用，要深刻领会，坚决照办，经常检查，及时总结。”
    装甲兵、工程兵的同志深有感触地畅谈了贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的体会。他们说，毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中所作的每条指示，每句话都是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领和唯一正确的指南。只有坚定不移地站在无产阶级立场，只有对毛主席的最新指示充满深厚的阶级感情，学一点，用一点，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能条条落实毛主席的最新指示。
    总后勤部、第二炮兵的同志，重温了毛主席的教导：“马克思列宁主义和中国革命的关系，就是箭和靶的关系。”他们说，毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级文化大革命也是箭和靶的关系。我们就是要用毛主席的最新指示之“矢”，来射无产阶级文化大革命之“的”。就是要用毛主席最新指示之“矢”，来射两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争之“的”。只有这样，才能紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。
    大家坚定地说，谁条条落实、句句照办毛主席的最新指示，谁就是真正的无产阶级革命派；谁违背毛主席的最新指示，谁就是口头革命派。
    空军和北京部队的同志还谈到，要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就必须坚决地、毫不调和地与违背毛主席最新指示的一切错误言行进行斗争。首先要与自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，彻底改造自己的非无产阶级世界观。大家表示：在新的一年中，一定要更进一步执行毛主席的要斗私，批修的伟大指示，象英雄李文忠同志那样，活学活用毛主席著作，对“私”字“彻底地亮、狠狠地斗、坚决地改”，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，将革命进行到底。
    条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    参加座谈的同志指出，元旦社论在新形势下，对全党、全军、全国人民提出了战略目标和战斗任务。条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是对无产阶级革命派的新的考验。
    总政治部、海军的同志说，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是一场艰巨的斗争。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”。毛主席的最新指示落实得越彻底，敌人就灭亡得越快；毛主席的最新指示落实得越好，敌人就垮台得越早。阶级敌人一定要更加阴险、更加狡猾地采取公开的和秘密的，直接的和迂回的反革命策略，从右的或极“左”的方面来干扰和破坏毛主席最新指示的全面落实。我们脑子里要有敌情，眼睛里要看到敌人，要用毛泽东思想来识破和粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。
    国防工办、通信兵、防化兵的同志谈到，一定要发扬无产阶级彻底的革命精神，把条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，作为一切行动的最高准则，使自己真正成为“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”
    参加座谈会的同志一致认为，我军在新的一年中，将担负起更艰巨、更重要的任务，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我军最大的信任。我们一定要作学习毛主席最新指示的模范，执行毛主席最新指示的模范，宣传毛主席最新指示的模范，捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，为人民立新功。
