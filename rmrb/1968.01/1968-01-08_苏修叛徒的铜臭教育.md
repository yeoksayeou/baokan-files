The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's mouthpiece, *Izvestia*, recently blatantly and extensively advocated for filling the "educational gap" of "youth and money," demanding that schools and families "view children earning money as part of an educational plan." *Izvestia* also fervently and repeatedly advocated for two methods: one is to focus on studying, where a youth can "complete hundreds of math problems" during the summer vacation, accumulating so-called "knowledge contributed to society." It is said that this method, although "not yet paid in cash," is "deposited in the bank," and "after a period, it is possible to receive labor remuneration with a lot of interest." Another method is to go to the streets to engage in the business of "selling flowers and ice cream" priced in rubles and kopecks. It is said that this can make students "possess labor skills" and "help in choosing a path and career."

The self-proclaimed "heirs of Lenin," the Soviet revisionist traitors, brazenly advocate for profit and money as the principles of education, loudly calling for the inclusion of understanding profit, knowing how to make money, and being able to exploit—these bourgeois tricks of seeking personal gain—into the "educational plan." They hysterically incite students to "choose" a path that can "earn money," truly reaching the depths of degradation.

Marxist-Leninists have always believed that education is a tool of class struggle. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the field of education is concentrated on the question of serving which class and training successors for which class.

The educational cause of the proletariat is to cultivate and train successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause, to serve proletarian politics, and to serve the dictatorship of the proletariat. The great Lenin pointed out: Soviet education should "carry on the cause that began with the October Revolution of 1917, transforming schools from tools of bourgeois class rule into tools for destroying such rule and completely eliminating social class divisions. Schools should become tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat." Lenin and his successor Stalin made tremendous efforts to establish their own Soviet educational system.

The traitor clique of Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin have completely betrayed the great legacy of Lenin, betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and comprehensively restored capitalism within the Soviet Union. Under the guise of "communist education," they spared no effort in promoting the rotten bourgeois education, instilling a whole set of bourgeois ideas into Soviet youth, and extensively advocating that "seeking knowledge is for profit, and receiving education is for making money." The bourgeois ideas of fame and profit have become the central content of Soviet revisionist education.

Under the corruption of the traitors' ideology of "rubles first," today's Soviet schools are flooded with bourgeois ideas, students indulge in drinking and entertainment, and some schools have become "bustling markets" for the import and sale of women's blouses. Students everywhere try to earn the money they "want," and students' academic standards are poor. The educational cause of the Soviet Union has been completely ruined by this group of traitors.

The Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique uses money and profit to corrupt the young generation of the Soviet Union, throwing them into the icy waters of selfishness, all to maintain their bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union and to consolidate their criminal rule of revisionism. They madly advocate for bourgeois education with money as the guiding principle, to cultivate capitalist successors for this group of traitors.

The great teacher of the world's people, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, creatively put forward a complete set of great thoughts on the proletarian educational revolution. Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts are an important part of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant and creative development of Marxism-Leninism. They have epoch-making significance for eliminating the bourgeois educational system and establishing a proletarian educational system.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our educational policy should enable those receiving education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, becoming laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. The working people must become knowledgeable, and intellectuals must become laborers." Chairman Mao earnestly reminded us that after the proletariat seizes power, it must carry out a thorough educational revolution, thoroughly criticize bourgeois reactionary thoughts, end the phenomenon of bourgeois rule over our schools, seize the leadership of the educational field, and establish a new type of proletarian school that "focuses on learning, also learns other things, that is, not only learns literature but also learns industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizes bourgeois thoughts." Chairman Mao has opened up a bright path for the proletariat to cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The modern revisionists in the Soviet Union have usurped power and carried out a comprehensive restoration of capitalism. This harsh fact, from the opposite side, has educated all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, making them deeply understand that after the proletariat seizes power, it must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, carry the revolution on the political and ideological front to the end, and carry out a magnificent educational revolution according to Chairman Mao's great educational revolutionary thoughts. Only in this way can they cultivate and train millions of successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and promote the victory of socialism and communism worldwide.

    苏修叛徒的铜臭教育
    装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派
    苏修叛徒集团的喉舌《消息报》最近公然大肆鼓吹要填补“少年和钱”这个“教育方面的一个空白点”，要求学校和家庭“把子女的挣钱看成一种教育计划”。《消息报》还狂热地、不厌其烦地鼓吹采用两种办法：一种是埋头读书，一个少年在暑假就能“完成数百道数学题”，积累所谓“献给社会的知识”。据说此种办法虽然“暂时还不是用现金付酬”，但“在银行里放着”，“过一个时期，就可能拿到加上不少利息的劳动报酬”；另一种是到大街上去，“从事以卢布和戈比计价”的“卖花、卖冰激凌”的生意。据说这能使学生“具有劳动能力”，“有助于选择道路和职业”。
    自称“列宁的继承者”的苏修叛徒，竟然明目张胆地把利润、金钱作为教育的原则，大声疾呼要把懂赢利、会赚钱、能剥削等这些资产阶级唯利是图的伎俩，列入“教育计划”，歇斯底里地鼓动学生去“选择”能够“挣钱”的“道路”，真是可谓堕落到极点了。
    马克思列宁主义者从来认为，教育是阶级斗争的一种工具。无产阶级同资产阶级在教育领域内的斗争，集中地表现在为哪个阶级服务，为哪个阶级培养接班人的问题上。
    无产阶级的教育事业，是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人，是为无产阶级政治服务，为无产阶级专政服务的。伟大的列宁指出：苏维埃的教育，要“把一九一七年十月革命时开始的事业进行到底，把学校由资产阶级的阶级统治工具变为摧毁这种统治和完全消灭社会阶级划分的工具。学校应当成为无产阶级专政的工具”。列宁和他的继承者斯大林，为在苏联建立起苏维埃自己的教育事业作了巨大的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫及其继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团彻底背叛了伟大列宁的遗训，背叛了无产阶级专政，在苏联国内全面复辟资本主义。他们在“共产主义教育”的幌子下，不遗余力地推行资产阶级教育的破烂，向苏联青年灌输整套整套的资产阶级思想，大肆宣扬“求知识就是为了赢利，受教育就是为了赚钱”。资产阶级的名利思想成了苏修教育的中心内容。
    在这一伙叛徒宣扬的卢布第一的思想腐蚀下，今日苏联的学校资产阶级思想泛滥，学生酗酒作乐，有的学校成了进口女用上衣投机买卖的“闹市”。学生到处设法挣他们“想要”的钱，学生学业水平低劣。苏联的教育事业完全被这伙叛徒糟塌得不成样子。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团用金钱、利润毒害苏联年青的一代，把他们抛入利己主义的冰水之中，就是为了维护它们在苏联的资产阶级专政，为了巩固他们修正主义的罪恶统治。他们疯狂地鼓吹金钱挂帅的资产阶级教育，就是为他们这伙叛徒培植资本主义的继承人。
    世界人民的伟大导师、我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席创造性地提出了一整套无产阶级教育革命的伟大思想。毛主席的教育革命思想，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是对马克思列宁主义天才的、创造性的发展。对于破除资产阶级的教育制度，建立无产阶级的教育制度，具有划时代的重大意义。
    毛主席指出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”毛主席谆谆告诫我们，无产阶级夺取政权以后，必须进行彻底的教育革命，彻底地批判资产阶级反动思想，结束资产阶级统治我们学校的现象，夺取教育领域的领导权，建立起“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的无产阶级新型的学校。毛主席为无产阶级开拓出一条培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的光明大道。
    现代修正主义者在苏联篡夺了政权，实行了资本主义全面的复辟。这一严酷的事实，从反面教育了全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，使他们深深地懂得，无产阶级夺取政权以后，必须遵照毛主席的伟大教导，把政治思想战线上的革命进行到底，必须按照毛主席的伟大教育革命思想，进行一场轰轰烈烈的教育革命，才能培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人，才能巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，促进社会主义、共产主义在全世界的胜利。
