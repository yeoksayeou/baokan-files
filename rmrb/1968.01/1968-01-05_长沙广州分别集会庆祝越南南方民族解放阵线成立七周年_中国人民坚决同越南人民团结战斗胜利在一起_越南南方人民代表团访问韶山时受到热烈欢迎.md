No matter how long this war lasts, whether it is five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, the people of South Vietnam will resolutely intensify their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until they drive out all U.S. aggressors from South Vietnam.

Comrade Nguyen Van Long said that Chairman Mao, in his congratulatory message to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, once again reaffirmed the Chinese people's full support for the people of South Vietnam.
