	Long Live Chairman Mao
	Four Volumes to Change Heaven and Earth
		Liu Xitao
	An axe to open the heavens and earth,
	A pillar to support the heavens and earth,
	A thunderclap to shake the heavens and earth,
	Four volumes to change heaven and earth.
	Long Live Mao Zedong!

		Sun Mingnan
	Peaks upon peaks of towering green mountains,
	The sun in the clear sky shines red on the mountains,
	People of the world look up and see,
	Long Live Mao Zedong!
	Truth Like Fire Burns in the Heart
		Jia Xingnian
	Four golden books never leave the hand,
	Quotations sung never leave the mouth;
	Truth like fire burns in the heart,
	Revolution to the end, never turning back!

	Victory All Thanks to Mao Zedong
		Xu Jirong
	Lamps need electricity, arrows need bows,
	Scatter the dark clouds with the east wind,
	The situation across the country is excellent,
	Victory all thanks to Mao Zedong.
	Sails need masts, houses need beams,
	Clear the fog with the sun,
	The motherland echoes with songs of victory,
	Victory all thanks to Mao Zedong's thought!

	This Year's Harvest Will Be Great
		Chen Xuexin
	Poles form teams, flags form rows, waves surge in the rice fields,
	This year's harvest will be great,
	Mao Zedong Thought planted in the heart!

    欢呼万岁毛主席
  改天换地四卷书
    刘希涛
  开天辟地一把斧，
  顶天立地一根柱，
  惊天动地一声雷，
  改天换地四卷书。
  欢呼万岁毛泽东
    孙明南
  巍巍青山峰连峰，
  晴空太阳照山红，
  世界人民抬头望，
  欢呼万岁毛泽东！
  真理似火燃红心
    贾杏年
  四卷金书不离手，
  语录歌儿不离口；
  真理似火燃红心，
  革命到底不回头！
  胜利全靠毛泽东
    许继荣
  灯靠电，箭靠弓，
  吹散乌云靠东风，
  全国形势无限好，
  胜利全靠毛泽东。
  帆靠樯，屋靠梁，
  拨开迷雾靠太阳，
  祖国遍地凯歌响，
  胜利全靠毛泽东思
    想！今年收成为啥好
    陈学新扁担成队旗成行，稻海涌起千重浪，今年收成为啥好，毛泽东思想种心
    上！
