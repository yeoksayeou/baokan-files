Editor's Note: Chairman Mao calls on us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Fighting selfishness must be closely linked with criticizing revisionism and must be elevated to the level of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. If we do not grasp the fundamental issues of politics, line, and direction, but only focus on minor issues and trivial matters, fighting selfishness will lose its direction and go astray. We must, in the midst of the intense class struggle, thoroughly study and apply the "Old Five Articles," firmly grasp the fundamental issues, firmly grasp our attitude towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely fight against selfishness and establish selflessness. This is the most fundamental task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The following article is by several representatives who participated in the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy. The authors are not only heroes of the sea and the sky but also pioneers in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They have applied Chairman Mao's works in their struggles and have worked hard to transform their worldviews, setting an example for us.

Establish a Firmly Rooted Spirit of Selflessness in the Communist Worldview

Commander of the 441st Unit, Wǔ Yì

Luo Ronghuan advocates "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" as being in line with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview. This is a complete distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white.

What exactly is "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage"? Luo Ronghuan has a blunt monologue: "I never thought of becoming the chairman of the state before... Now, haven't I become the chairman of the state?" "Not considering personal interests will ultimately benefit personal interests," "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." He tells people to "suffer a small loss," "temporarily not consider personal interests," "suffer first," and so on, all to use these means to seek future promotions and wealth, to become a factory director, a secretary, up to a minister of a central department, or the chairman of the state. Obviously, "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" is to sacrifice some small personal interests to seize big personal interests, it is the "one investment, ten returns" of the exploiting class. This is a typical bourgeois selfish worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two kinds: the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. Either it is the proletarian worldview, or it is the bourgeois worldview."

The proletarian worldview is to "serve the people wholeheartedly," "everything from the people's interests, not from personal or small group interests," "completely selfless," "completely selfless and dedicated to others."

Chairman Mao's teachings are our guidelines for action. We, the naval officers and soldiers, have been at sea for years, coming and going in the wind and waves, often fighting for days and nights in the vast ocean. Many people get seasick, vomiting while continuing to operate. In winter, the wind and rain on the sea are like sharp knives on the face; in summer, the deck is scorching hot. Despite such hardships, our soldiers still find joy in hardship and face difficulties head-on. Ask yourself, is all this for "gaining a big advantage" and obtaining some "personal interests" in the future? Not a bit of it. The soldiers say well: We are suffering great hardships for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We stand guard and patrol in the wind and rain for the happiness of the majority.

Whether a person is revolutionizing to establish a communist society and liberate all of humanity, or to "gain advantages," promote oneself, and enrich oneself, this is the touchstone of whether one has a proletarian worldview or a bourgeois worldview. A true proletarian revolutionary always listens to Chairman Mao's words, puts the interests of the party and the people first, is selfless, and serves the people wholeheartedly.

To establish a proletarian worldview, one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, breaking down selfishness and establishing selflessness. We have engaged in a head-on struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ronghuan's bourgeois reactionary military line. For this, we have been attacked, suppressed, marginalized, and framed. However, "For the sake of sacrifice, we dare to change the heavens and the earth." We are determined to fight for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line while alive and to dedicate ourselves to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even in death! We finally repelled the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ronghuan's countercurrent. The struggle has educated us that the proletarian revolutionary faction armed with Mao Zedong Thought must resolutely eliminate the "self" from the mind, build a fortress of "public," and thus resist the infiltration of various bourgeois ideas, pass the test of sharp and complex class struggle and line struggle, see through the enemy's tricks, maintain the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On the contrary, if there are selfish thoughts in the mind, one will not be able to distinguish between friends and enemies, lose direction; or dare not stand up in crucial moments, insist on struggle, or even follow the wind, fall into the bourgeois swamp.

We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, "Fight selfishness, criticize revisionism," criticize the bourgeois worldview of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" advocated by Luo Ronghuan, resolutely fight against the "self" in our minds, grasp the fundamental issues, establish selflessness, and firmly establish a spirit of selflessness in the communist worldview.

### 牢固树立一心为公的共产主义世界观

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    编者按　毛主席号召我们要斗私，批修。斗私要跟批修紧密联系，要把斗私提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的纲上来。不抓政治、路线、方向性的大节，只注意小是小非、小枝小节，斗私就会迷失方向，走入歧途。我们必须在轰轰烈烈的阶级斗争中大学大用“老五篇”，狠抓大节，狠抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的态度，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，牢固树立无产阶级世界观。这是无产阶级文化大革命最根本的战斗任务。
    这里发表的是参加海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的几位代表批判中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级世界观的文章。文章的作者既是海上和空中的英雄，又是斗私的闯将，批修的先锋。他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，为我们作出了榜样。
    牢固树立一心为公的共产主义世界观
    四四一一部队长　武毅
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“吃小亏，占大便宜”是“合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观”的。真是颠倒是非，混淆黑白。
    到底什么是“吃小亏，占大便宜”呢？中国赫鲁晓夫有一段赤裸裸的独白：“我以前根本没有想当国家主席，……现在不也当上国家主席了吗？”“不考虑个人利益则最后有个人利益”，“吃点小亏，占大便宜。”他叫人们“吃小亏”，“暂时不考虑个人利益”，“吃苦在前”，等等，就是叫人们用这种手段去谋求将来的升官发财，当个厂长、书记，一直到当中央部长、国家主席。很显然，“吃小亏，占大便宜”，就是以牺牲一些小的个人利益去攫取大的个人利益，就是剥削阶级“一本万利”的那一套。这完全是典型的资产阶级利己主义的世界观。
    毛主席教导我们：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”
    无产阶级世界观，就是“全心全意地为人民服务”，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，“毫无自私自利之心”，“毫不利己专门利人”。
    毛主席的教导是我们的行动准则。我们海军指战员长年累月，风里来，浪里去，常常连续几昼夜战斗在茫茫大海上，很多人晕船，一边吐，一边坚持操作。冬天，海上的风雨，象尖刀刺在脸上；夏天，甲板晒得发烫。尽管这样艰苦，我们的战士仍然以苦为乐，知难而进。试问，这一切，难道是为了自己“占大便宜”，将来获取点什么“个人利益”吗？一丝一毫都不是。战士们说得好：我们是为中国革命和世界革命去吃大苦，我们在风雨里站岗巡逻，就是为了大多数人的幸福。
    一个人是为了建立共产主义社会、实现全人类的解放去干革命，还是为了“占便宜”、升官发财去干“革命”，这是无产阶级世界观还是资产阶级世界观的试金石。真正的无产阶级革命战士，总是永远听毛主席的话，把党和人民的利益放在第一位，一心为公，一心为革命，全心全意为人民服务。
    要树立无产阶级世界观，就必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公。我们同反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的资产阶级反动军事路线进行过针锋相对的斗争，为此我们曾经遭到过围攻、打击、排挤、陷害。但是“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”我们决心活着要为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋斗，死也是为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身！我们终于击退了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿掀起的逆流。斗争的实践教育了我们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，必须坚决清除头脑里的“私”字，建立起一个“公”字筑成的堡垒，这样才能够抵制各种资产阶级思想的侵蚀，才能够经得起尖锐复杂的阶级斗争、路线斗争的考验，才能够识破敌人的阴谋诡计，保持无产阶级旺盛的革命斗志，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。相反，如果头脑里有了私心杂念，就会分不清敌我，迷失方向；或者是不敢在关键时刻挺身而出，坚持斗争，甚至见风使舵，掉进资产阶级泥坑。
    我们一定要最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，“斗私，批修”，批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级世界观，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，抓大节，立大公，牢固树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。
