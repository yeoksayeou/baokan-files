The Chinese Dawn Dance Troupe, after a two-month overseas visit, returned to the motherland laden with the deep affection and friendship of the people of Guinea and Iraq for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and for the Chinese people. The people of Guinea and Iraq regarded the performances of the Dawn Dance Troupe, which shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, as a great victory for Mao Zedong's literary thought.

Singing in Unison for the Red Sun

The people of Guinea, who are engaged in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, love to watch the dances "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" the most, and love to listen to the songs "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" the most. Every time the radiant image of Chairman Mao appears on the screen, every time the words "Long Live Chairman Mao" appear on the stage in golden letters, and every time the performers shout "Long Live Chairman Mao," the audience below erupts in wave after wave of enthusiastic, long-lasting applause. There were times when, as the performers sang "The East Is Red," the vast audience below joined in and sang along loudly; there were times when, as soon as the singing of "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" began, the audience's loud voices blended with the performers' voices, and the audience's heartfelt love for Chairman Mao echoed throughout the performance hall. Some audience members waved the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high in the air as they sang with the performers.

Once, during a performance, a worker from a tobacco factory in Guinea pointed to the radiant image of Chairman Mao on the stage and said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We love Chairman Mao. Whenever I see Chairman Mao, I feel full of strength." He also took out a colorful photograph of Chairman Mao from his pocket, carefully holding it in his hands, and said with deep emotion, "If I could see the great leader Chairman Mao with my own eyes, that would be so happy!"

Revolutionary Art is Majestic

The revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit of the Chinese Dawn Dance Troupe's performances deeply moved foreign audiences. The Iraqi newspaper *Revolution* said in a commentary: "The performance of the Chinese dance troupe is a powerful support and encouragement for the Arab people's just struggle against aggression, a powerful support and encouragement for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation, and a powerful support and encouragement for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism."

The dance "Annihilate the Aggressors," performed by the troupe, is a dance that the audience particularly loves. Every time the stage shows the American aggressors and their lackeys being defeated and surrendering to the heroic Vietnamese people in a people's war, the entire audience erupts in prolonged, enthusiastic applause, and the audience members shout in unison: "Down with American imperialism!" "American imperialism must get out of Vietnam!"

When the Chinese Dawn Dance Troupe performed the Palestinian warrior dance "Go to Battle" in Iraq, the broad audience was deeply attracted by this dance, which embodies Chairman Mao's great thought of daring to struggle and daring to win. The heroic spirit of the Palestinian warriors, who are determined to fight to the end against the American and Israeli aggressors, won thunderous applause.

An Iraqi newspaper said: "The outstanding performance of the Dawn Dance Troupe truly shows us: Only through armed struggle can we drive the aggressors out of our territory."

World Revolutionary Art Vanguard

The brilliant performances of the Chinese Dawn Dance Troupe caused a sensation throughout Guinea and Iraq. To watch the performances of the dance troupe sent from the world revolutionary center—Beijing—many people traveled from distant places, and some even watched multiple times.

A Guinean electrician, Balde Amil, heard the news of the Chinese dance troupe's performance and specially traveled from a village more than twenty miles away to the city. After watching the performance, he excitedly told the Chinese performers: "On your stage, there are no talented scholars or beautiful women anymore. We workers and peasants have become the subjects of praise. The more I watch, the more I want to watch, and the more I watch, the more energized I feel."

A responsible person from the Iraqi Ballet School, after watching the performance, praised the dance troupe's performance as the most moving one she had ever seen. Several Iraqi friends specially traveled from the distant south to Baghdad to watch the dance troupe's performance. After watching, they said: "Your performance was very successful and proved the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This Chinese art, which has been reborn in the Cultural Revolution, is the most progressive and attractive art of the contemporary world. It has opened up a broad path for world revolutionary art."

A middle school student from Mamou City in Guinea, after watching the Chinese dance troupe's performance, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter with boundless excitement: "I saw the most beautiful art in the world. Its reflection of the people's revolutionary struggle and its national forms that the people love to see deeply attracted me and left an indelible impression on me." He said: "The slander of imperialists and modern revisionists against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is purely a lie. The outstanding performance of the dance troupe gave them a slap in the face!"

    毛主席的文艺思想光芒四射
    ——记我曙光歌舞团在几内亚和伊拉克演出
    中国曙光歌舞团在两个月的出国访问后，满载着几内亚和伊拉克人民对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深情厚谊和对中国人民的友好感情，不久前胜利回到了祖国。几内亚和伊拉克两国人民把曙光歌舞团闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的演出，看作是毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利。
    同声高歌红太阳
    正在进行反帝反殖斗争的几内亚人民，最爱看《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》这两个舞蹈，最爱听《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》这两支歌曲。每当神采奕奕的毛主席像出现在天幕上的时候，每当舞台上出现金光闪闪的“毛主席万岁”的字样的时候，每当演员们高呼“毛主席万岁”的时候，台下就爆发出一阵阵热烈的经久不息的掌声。有几次，当台上的演员唱《东方红》时，台下的广大观众也随着一起放声歌唱起来；有几次，当演唱《大海航行靠舵手》刚开始，观众洪亮的歌声便与演员的歌声融为一体，观众们发自内心的热爱毛主席的歌声回荡在整个演出大厅。有些观众在同演员们一起歌唱时，还高高挥动红色宝书《毛主席语录》。
    有一次演出时，一位几内亚烟厂工人指着舞台上光芒四射的毛主席像说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，我们热爱毛主席。我一看到毛主席，就浑身有力量。”他还从口袋里拿出一幅毛主席的彩色照片，小心翼翼地托在手上，深情地说：“如果能亲眼看看伟大领袖毛主席，该多么幸福呵！”
      革命艺术气壮山河
    中国曙光歌舞团充满革命豪情和战斗精神的革命歌舞，深受外国观众的热烈欢迎。伊拉克《革命报》在一篇评论中说：“中国歌舞团的演出是对阿拉伯人民反侵略正义斗争的有力支持和鼓舞，是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的有力支持和鼓舞，是对亚非拉人民反帝反殖斗争的有力支持和鼓舞。”
    歌舞团演出的越南舞蹈《消灭侵略者》，是观众非常喜爱的一个舞蹈。每当舞台上演到美国侵略者及其走狗被英雄的越南人民用人民战争打得狼狈不堪、缴枪投降的时候，全场就迸发出长久的热烈掌声，观众们同仇敌忾地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义必须从越南滚出去！”
    中国曙光歌舞团在伊拉克演出巴勒斯坦战士舞《去战斗》的时候，广大观众被这个体现了毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大思想的舞蹈深深吸引住了，巴勒斯坦战士决心同美以侵略者斗争到底的英雄气概，博得了暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    伊拉克一家报纸说：“曙光歌舞团的杰出表演，真实地向我们指出：只有通过武装斗争才能把侵略者从我们的领土上赶出去。”
      世界革命艺术先锋
    中国曙光歌舞团的精采演出，轰动了整个几内亚和伊拉克。为了观看从世界革命中心——北京派来的歌舞团的演出，许多人远从外地赶来观看，有的人还一看再看。
    几内亚一位电工巴尔德·阿米尔在听到中国歌舞团演出的消息后，特地从二十多里外的乡下赶到城里，他在看了演出后激动地对中国演员说：“在你们的舞台上，没有才子佳人了，我们这些工人、农民都成了歌颂的对象，我越看越想看，越看越有劲。”
    伊拉克芭蕾舞学校的一位负责人在观看了演出后，赞扬歌舞团的演出是她看到的最动人的一次演出。几位伊拉克朋友特地从遥远的南部赶到巴格达来观看歌舞团的演出。他们在观看以后说：“你们的演出很成功，用事实证明了中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这种在文化大革命中获得新生的中国艺术是当代最进步最吸引人的艺术，它为世界革命艺术开辟了一条康庄大道。”
    几内亚玛木市一位中学生在看过中国歌舞团的演出后，怀着无限兴奋的心情对新华社记者说：“我看到了世界上最美好的艺术。它所反映的人民革命斗争的内容和人民大众喜闻乐见的民族形式，深深地吸引着我，给我留下了难以磨灭的印象。”他说：“帝国主义者和现代修正主义者对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑，纯粹是造谣。歌舞团的出色表演就给了他们一记耳光！”
