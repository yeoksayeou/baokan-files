The two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Xinjiang Railway System, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieve revolutionary great unity, and set an example for the revolutionary masses of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to achieve revolutionary great unity.

On January 27, more than ten thousand revolutionary workers of the Xinjiang Railway System and local garrison soldiers of the People's Liberation Army gathered with great excitement to solemnly celebrate the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the new victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The State Council sent a telegram of congratulations. When the conference read the telegram from the State Council, the entire audience of military and civilian personnel was extremely moved, shouting "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" over and over again.

The revolutionary workers attending the conference expressed their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, saying: We must resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, reform our worldview, and pledge to be "revolutionary masses who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We must implement and fully implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity, promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units more deeply, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Xinjiang Railway System reached an agreement on January 5 to achieve revolutionary great unity, many grassroots units also achieved revolutionary great unity, creating a lively situation of mutual promotion between upper and lower levels.

The responsible comrades of the Xinjiang Military Region, Huanyuan Lin, the responsible comrades of the 7335th Unit, Li Quanqing, and the political department director of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, Li Jingshan, spoke at the conference. They warmly congratulated the revolutionary great unity of the Xinjiang Railway System and hoped that all revolutionary workers of the railway would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for the dual victories of revolution and production.

The conference, amid thunderous applause and cheers, passed a telegram of tribute to our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao.
