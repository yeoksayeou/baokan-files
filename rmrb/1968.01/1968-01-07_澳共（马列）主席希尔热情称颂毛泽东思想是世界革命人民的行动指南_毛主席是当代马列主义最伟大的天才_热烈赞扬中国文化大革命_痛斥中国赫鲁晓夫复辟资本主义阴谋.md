	The Chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Hill, recently published an article in the "Vanguard" newspaper, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and strongly condemning the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China.

	The article states: "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage of Marxism-Leninism." "Mao Zedong Thought guides the revolutionary practice and struggle of revolutionary people all over the world." "As the highest development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought is a guide to action, a guide to revolutionary action."

	The article points out: In this era, a great genius has emerged—Mao Zedong. This is the need of the times. In our era, Chairman Mao is recognized by the people as a genius of Marxism-Leninism. The article states that the Chinese people wish Chairman Mao a long life, and we also wish him a long life. "We make this wish because he has made the greatest contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism and will continue to make the greatest contribution."

	The article points out that Chairman Mao "has more practical experience in leading and guiding revolutionary struggles than anyone in history." "No Marxist-Leninist has studied, developed, and practiced class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat as he has. Chairman Mao's confidence in launching the Cultural Revolution in China is one of the many examples of his courage as a genius of Marxism-Leninism."

	The article condemns the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China. The article states that a gang of bad elements led by the Chinese Khrushchev have opposed Chairman Mao at every stage of the Chinese revolution. "They are traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and many of them have been traitors for a long time. They have cleverly concealed themselves to serve the bourgeoisie and imperialists. They are modern revisionists in China." The article points out that this gang of bad elements led by the Chinese Khrushchev fiercely resist Mao Zedong Thought. "They use every means to try to restore capitalism in China." "But the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. Today, in China, Mao Zedong Thought has achieved great victories."

	The article celebrates the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The article states: "This is not only a victory for China but also a victory for the oppressed people and laboring people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought has spread far and wide."

	The article points out: "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of Marxism-Leninism and is now recognized by more and more people. Millions of people are recognizing the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought in the fiery struggle of class struggle."

	The article emphasizes: "Facts, practice, and history have shown that Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the oppressed people of the world."

	The article concludes: "Acknowledging Chairman Mao as an outstanding genius of Marxism-Leninism is a very important issue for Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary struggle. The bourgeoisie and modern revisionists spare no effort to defame Chairman Mao's greatness, while workers and laboring people are vigorously promoting Chairman Mao's greatness. Australian Marxist-Leninists must hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

    澳共（马列）主席希尔热情称颂毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的行动指南
    毛主席是当代马列主义最伟大的天才
    热烈赞扬中国文化大革命　痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义阴谋
    新华社墨尔本五日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔最近在《先锋报》上发表文章，热情赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，强烈谴责中国赫鲁晓夫企图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    文章说：“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的最高发展。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的新阶段。”“毛泽东思想指导着全世界革命人民的革命实践和斗争。”“作为马克思列宁主义的最高发展的毛泽东思想是行动的指南，革命行动的指南。”
    文章指出：当代出现了伟大的天才——毛泽东，这是时代的需要。在我们的时代，毛主席是人民公认的马克思列宁主义的天才。文章说，中国人民祝毛主席万寿无疆，我们也祝愿他万寿无疆。“我们这样祝愿，正是因为他对马克思列宁主义的发展，作出了最大的贡献，并且必将继续作出最大的贡献。”
    文章指出，毛主席“在领导和指导革命斗争方面，比历史上任何人有更多的实际经验”。“没有一个马克思列宁主义者象他这样研究、发展和实践了无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争。毛主席这样满怀信心地在中国开展无产阶级文化大革命，是他作为马克思列宁主义天才的魄力的许多例证之一。”
    文章谴责中国赫鲁晓夫企图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋。文章说，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一帮坏人在中国革命的每个发展阶段，都是反对毛主席的。“他们是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，其中不少人早就是叛徒。他们把自己巧妙地隐蔽起来，以便为资产阶级和帝国主义者效劳。他们是中国的现代修正主义者。”文章指出，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的这批坏人拚命抵制毛泽东思想。“他们用一切办法企图在中国复辟资本主义。”“但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众是战无不胜的。今天在中国，毛泽东思想已经赢得了伟大胜利。”
    文章欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。文章说：“这不仅是中国的胜利，而且是全世界劳苦人民和被压迫人民的胜利。毛泽东思想已经传播得很远而且很广泛。”
    文章指出：“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的最高发展，现在已为越来越多的人民所承认。千百万人民正在阶级斗争的烈火中认识到毛泽东思想的正确性。”
    文章强调说：“事实、实践和历史已经表明毛主席是全世界被压迫人民伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手。”
    文章最后说：“承认毛主席作为一个马克思列宁主义者的杰出的天才，是马克思列宁主义和革命斗争的一个极为重要的问题。资产阶级和现代修正主义者不遗余力地诋毁毛主席的伟大，工人和劳动人民却在大力宣传毛主席的伟大。澳大利亚马克思列宁主义者必须更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。”
