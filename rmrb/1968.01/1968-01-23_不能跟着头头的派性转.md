Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our parts warehouse was the first in the entire factory to achieve revolutionary great unity by work unit. Reflecting on the situation before and after unity, we have a realization: members of revolutionary mass organizations must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They must not blindly follow the leader's factionalism but must consciously struggle against it.

Our parts warehouse has seven people, who were previously divided into three organizations and two factions. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is truly harmful. For example, in our unit, Wang Guizhen and Liu Rongxia, because one joined the "Red Rebels" and the other joined the "East is Red," the two often argued fiercely, becoming bitter enemies. After the PLA came to support the left, they led us to study the "Three Articles" and helped us analyze the harm of factionalism. Only then did we begin to understand a bit. The PLA comrades, after learning that we were all class sisters who had suffered deeply in the old society, inspired us to recall our bitterness and share our hearts. Liu Rongxia, the daughter of a martyr, recounted the bitter hatred of her parents being killed by the enemy; Wang Guizhen recalled her childhood of picking coal, living in a dilapidated temple, and once being driven to suicide by the old society; ... National hatred and class resentment brought our hearts together. Wang Guizhen and Liu Rongxia, tears streaming down their faces, said: "In the past, factionalism blinded our eyes, making us unable to distinguish between friends and enemies, fighting each other all day!" "For factionalism, even death is light as a feather!" All seven of us understood a truth: in the old society, worker brothers were bitter gourds on the same vine; today, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must unite to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life! From then on, we united in our thoughts, and the two factions became one.

At that time, the two factions in the factory had not yet united, and factional struggles were still fierce. The more we saw, the more we disliked factionalism.

We studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must ask why for every matter, must think it over carefully in their minds, see if it conforms to reality, see if it is truly reasonable, and absolutely must not blindly follow or advocate slavishness." This attitude should also be adopted towards the words and deeds of the leaders of mass organizations. If they follow Chairman Mao, we will follow them; if they engage in factional activities and deviate from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will not only not follow them but will also oppose them.

From then on, when some leaders wanted us to go to other factories to "support" factional struggles, we did not go. We did not participate in factional meetings. We thought: "Seven people sitting in the house studying the 'Three Articles' is not better?" The words of the leaders of the mass organizations, we often discussed and analyzed together, supporting what conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and criticizing what is factional. Some comrades even criticized the leaders because their faction was preparing a "self-defense corps" to deal with the opposition.

We did this, and there were rumors outside saying we were "inconsistent." We used Chairman Mao's teachings to respond: "We stand on the proletarian and people's mass standpoint. For Communist Party members, it means standing on the party's standpoint, on the standpoint of party nature and party policy." Chairman Mao also taught us: "Erroneous leadership that harms the revolution should not be accepted unconditionally but should be resolutely resisted." We stand on the proletarian and party nature standpoint, resisting the leader's factionalism, how can it be said that we are inconsistent?

We not only pay attention to resisting factionalism but also strive to promote the revolutionary great unity in the factory. Chairman Mao called on us to carry out a great criticism, although most of us cannot recognize a single character, but with our deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, we still set up the first joint great criticism column in the entire factory. We felt that this was a blow to factionalism. As soon as we memorized the "Three Articles," we united on stage to perform for the entire factory. Many comrades, after seeing our joint great criticism column and joint performance, said with emotion: "Look, the parts warehouse has united, we must catch up!"

Because of our firm follow of Chairman Mao, not blindly following the leader, paying attention to resisting and overcoming the influence of factionalism, the revolutionary great unity in the parts warehouse took the lead in the entire factory and became more and more solid.

A sudden thunderclap, Chairman Mao issued the latest directive: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." We seven people jumped for joy. Chairman Mao's words hit the mark! On the day of celebrating the entire factory's achievement of revolutionary great unity, we made a resolution to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, struggle against all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    不能跟着头头的派性转
    北京针织总厂零件库革命职工
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们零件库在全厂第一个实现了按班组的革命大联合。回顾联合前后的情况，我们有个体会：革命群众组织的成员，要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就不能盲目跟着头头的派性转，而是应当自觉地同派性作斗争。
    我们零件库七个人，过去分成三个组织两大派。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性真害人。例如，我们组里的王桂珍和刘荣霞，就因为一个参加了“红色造反者”，一个参加了“东方红”，两个人闹得针尖对麦芒，动不动就吵得面红耳赤。解放军支左同志进厂了，领着我们学习“老三篇”，帮助我们分析派性的害处，大家才对立得差了一些。解放军同志了解到我们都是旧社会里苦大仇深的阶级姐妹以后，又启发我们忆苦交心。刘荣霞这个烈士的女儿，诉说了父母惨遭敌人杀害的血泪仇；王桂珍回忆了幼年拣煤核，住破庙，曾被旧社会逼得上吊寻死的辛酸史；……民族仇，阶级恨，把大家的心紧紧地拉在一起。王桂珍和刘荣霞激动得流着泪水说：“过去让派性蒙住了眼睛，分不清敌我，成天自己打自己！”“为派性吵死了，也轻如鸿毛！”七个人都明白了一个道理：在旧社会，工人兄弟是一根藤上的苦瓜；今天，无产阶级革命派更要联合起来，跟毛主席干一辈子革命！从此，我们从思想上联合起来了，两派变成了一派。
    当时，厂子里两派还没有联合，派性斗争还很厉害。我们越看越不顺眼，越来越讨厌派性。
    我们学习了毛主席的教导：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”对于群众组织负责人的言行，也应当采取这样的态度。他们紧跟毛主席，我们就跟他们走；如果他们搞派性活动，背离了毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们就不仅不能跟着转，而且要反对。
    从此，有的头头让我们到外厂去“支援”派性斗争，我们就不去。派性的会，也不去参加。我们想：“七个人坐在屋里学‘老三篇’，不是更好吗？”群众组织负责人讲的话，我们也常一起讨论分析，凡是符合毛泽东思想的就支持，带派性的就共同批判。有的同志还因为他们那一派成立准备对付对方的“自卫队”，专门找负责人提了意见。
    我们这样做，外面也有风言风语，说我们“立场不坚定”。我们就用毛主席的教导来回答：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”毛主席还教导我们：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”我们站在无产阶级的立场、党性的立场上，抵制头头的派性，怎么能说是立场不坚定呢？
    我们不但注意抵制派性，还努力去促进厂里的革命大联合。毛主席号召我们开展革命的大批判，我们虽然多数人斗大的字识不了半口袋，但是大家怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，还是办起了全厂第一个联合大批判专栏。我们觉得这样做，就是对派性的一个打击。我们刚背会“老三篇”，就联合登台向全厂群众演出。不少同志看了我们的联合大批判专栏和联合演出，感动地说：“看，人家零件库都联合了，我们要迎头赶上啊！”
    由于我们在解放军同志帮助下，坚决跟毛主席走，不盲目随头头转，注意抵制和克服派性的影响，零件库的革命大联合，在全厂先走一步，而且越来越巩固。
    平地一声春雷，毛主席发出了最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们七个人高兴得跳了起来。毛主席他老人家的话，可说到我们心坎里了！在欢庆全厂实现革命大联合的日子里，我们就下了决心，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同形形色色的非无产阶级思想作斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
