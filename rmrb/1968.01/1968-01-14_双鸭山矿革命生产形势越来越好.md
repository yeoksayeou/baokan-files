The Shuangyashan Mine Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the mine area have adopted the method of using typical examples to drive general progress. They have mobilized revolutionary workers to deeply carry out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, guard against arrogance, and break through complacency. This has pushed the revolutionary and production situation in the entire mine area to a new level. Since mid-December last year, the four mines and nineteen shafts in the entire mine area have increased their average daily production by 33% compared to the daily plan. Among them, ten shafts have increased production by more than onefold, and both mining and excavation have made significant progress.
