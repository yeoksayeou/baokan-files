In the new year, we must follow the direction indicated in the New Year's Day editorial, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and implement in every way Mao Zedong's latest instructions. We must resolutely carry out the great battle command of the great leader Mao Zedong, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," and adhere to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions." We must strive to accomplish the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," truly using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, becoming promoters of the excellent situation.

To be promoters of the excellent situation, we must recognize the new situation and keep up with the new situation. Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unprecedentedly excellent. "The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized." The great movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and deeper. The revolutionary great criticism is being further deepened. Revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations are developing and consolidating. The entire situation of the Cultural Revolution is advancing along the course charted by Chairman Mao, swiftly moving towards the great goal of achieving comprehensive victory. "The more the revolution advances, the more profoundly it touches people's souls, and the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's 'public' and the bourgeoisie's 'private' becomes." The factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will also manifest in various ways. The new situation requires us to work even harder in the "three supports and two militaries" to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, and always adhere to supporting the left with party spirit, firmly and unshakably implementing the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions." This is a requirement of the revolution, a requirement of the situation, a requirement of class struggle, and a requirement for achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, in the "three supports and two militaries" work, we must be particularly vigilant against the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and must always and everywhere engage in uncompromising struggle against factionalism, firmly standing on the revolutionary stand of the proletariat, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and bravely defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. If we do not raise and recognize issues in this way, we will deviate from Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fall behind, and make serious mistakes.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a venomous snake, a vicious enemy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With factionalism, there is no firm party spirit, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be implemented; with factionalism, the excellent situation cannot be seen clearly, and one becomes a political mediocrity; with factionalism, one does not care about the whole but only seeks fame and profit for one's own small group; with factionalism, there is no standard for distinguishing right from wrong, and one cannot distinguish between right and wrong, or draw clear lines; with factionalism, one easily becomes resentful and vents personal grievances, using emotions to replace policies, directing the spearhead at one's comrades and fellow fighters, losing the revolutionary direction of struggle, and even doing things that cause pain to friends and pleasure to enemies; with factionalism, one easily becomes a tool for the class enemy, playing a role in harming oneself and shielding the bad. This extremely evil thing, factionalism, originates from the selfishness of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, is completely the corrupt style of bourgeois party competition, is the darling of "private," and is the great enemy of the revolution. It is incompatible with the revolutionary interests of the proletariat and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only the class enemy wants us to retain factionalism. We proletarian revolutionaries are fighting for the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, for the defense of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and absolutely do not allow factionalism to occupy our minds. We should clearly recognize: "Whether or not one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." We should consciously follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Take revolutionary interests as one's first life, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests," prevent the infiltration and influence of factionalism, thoroughly defeat factionalism, establish a firm proletarian party spirit, and become true proletarian revolutionaries.

True proletarian revolutionaries must have boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao; they must implement Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions word for word and sentence for sentence, and all their thoughts and actions must conform to Mao Zedong Thought. This is the most concentrated expression of proletarian party spirit and the highest interests of the proletariat. In carrying out the tasks of "three supports and two militaries," we must stand on the stand of proletarian party spirit and use Mao Zedong Thought to support the left. No matter which revolutionary mass organization, as long as it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, conforms to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, we must resolutely support it. Conversely, we must not support it and must seriously help it, doing thorough, in-depth, and detailed ideological and political work. This is the most glorious duty and combat mission of Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters.

The key to adhering to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions" lies in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, transforming one's worldview, and turning Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions into conscious actions. Vice Chairman Lin said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, is the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, is the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times, and is the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat." He also said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution." We must follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, take "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, study and apply the "Old Five Articles" extensively, thoroughly repudiate "private," and establish "public." We must have a revolution in the depths of our souls. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are imprinted with class characteristics." This is an absolutely true great truth. In our minds, there is no vacuum; it is either public or private; it is either proletarian party spirit or bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism; it is either highlighting proletarian politics or highlighting bourgeois politics. "Private" must be eliminated, and the roots of revisionism must be dug out; bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism must be defeated, and proletarian party spirit must be established. Therefore, we must consciously and thoroughly "criticize the self and repudiate revisionism," fundamentally defeat factionalism, and strengthen party spirit. In the depths of our souls, we must establish a heart that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and unshakably "stand on the stand of the Party, stand on the stand of party spirit and Party policy," and charge forward to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Practice has proven that those who strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the transformation of worldview, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most resolute, and their proletarian party spirit is the strongest, and the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions" is grasped the best. In situations where the two revolutionary organizations are seriously opposed, one can fiercely criticize selfish thoughts, not calculate personal gains and losses, and insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to support the left; when facing external pressure, one can use party spirit to overcome factionalism, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, change the "fear" character to the "dare" character, change the "I" character to the "public" character, change "believing in oneself" to "believing in the masses," and actively support and help the proletarian revolutionaries; in the two revolutionary mass organizations, when one side is vigorously advocating its correctness, one will not be biased, and one can help the two sides gradually unite on the principle basis of Mao Zedong Thought; when helping the two revolutionary mass organizations solve contradictions and encountering criticism, one can put revolutionary interests first, not act impulsively, not use emotions to replace policies, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to arm the masses' minds, and quickly solve problems. Even if sometimes there are shortcomings and errors in thoughts and work, one can "insist on truth and correct errors at any time," consciously raise the issue, seriously examine it, humbly listen to the masses' criticisms, timely overcome shortcomings, and correct errors.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggle." To adhere to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions," one must "propagate Mao Zedong Thought extensively, do in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work." We are determined to take the 8341 Unit, which carried out support-the-left tasks in the Beijing Knitting General Factory, as an example, and take the "support-the-left and love-the-people model platoon" and the "support-the-left and love-the-people model" comrade Li Wenzhong as a mirror. We will wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought, help the proletarian revolutionaries, and through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, first of all, grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary forces, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations from the ideological aspect. For the contradictions between the two revolutionary mass organizations, we will not stand on one side of a revolutionary mass organization, nor will we support one side and exclude the other. We will solve the problems through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism"; for the handling of major issues, we will definitely put them on the table to solve, not act on our own behind the scenes, or do our own thing; for the old rebels who have made mistakes, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, adhere to the principle of helping, criticizing, and uniting, and make them truly unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will further study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do well in the ideological and political work in supporting the left, learn from the masses, respectfully and sincerely learn from the masses, constantly listen to the masses' criticisms, constantly draw political nutrition from the masses, grasp the ideological revolutionization of the "three supports and two militaries" personnel, and make sure that we, under any circumstances and facing any interference and impact, can firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle and adhere to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions."

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always struggle desperately." In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about to achieve comprehensive victory, all class enemies will not willingly perish, and they will try every means to sabotage and disrupt, attempting to use factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to create incidents, sow discord, and disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks. We must "never forget class struggle," definitely heighten our revolutionary vigilance, resolutely defeat factionalism, expose factionalism, and thoroughly smash any tricks of the class enemies. We must more closely unite with other support-the-left units and unite and fight with the proletarian revolutionaries. If the class enemies dare to act rashly, they will only lift a rock to drop on their own feet and suffer a disgraceful failure.

"Open your eyes to see the future, advance resolutely." Looking ahead to 1968, it will be a year of even greater and more glorious victories. We must be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity, carry forward our achievements, overcome shortcomings, and even higher hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    加强无产阶级党性，坚决支左不支派
    人民解放军六四○九部队、七三五○部队
    在新的一年里，我们要按照元旦社论指出的方向，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大战斗号令，坚持“支左不支派”的原则，努力完成“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，真正做到用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，当大好形势的促进派。
    当大好形势的促进派，必须认清新形势，紧跟新形势。当前，无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，“形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了”。活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动更加广泛，更加深入。革命的大批判正在进一步深入开展。革命的大联合和革命的三结合日益发展巩固。整个文化大革命的形势，正沿着毛主席指引的航向，朝着夺取全面胜利的伟大目标迅跑。“革命越向前发展，就越是深刻地触及到人们的灵魂，无产阶级的‘公’字和资产阶级的
  ‘私’字的冲突就越突出”。资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，也就从各方面表现出来了。新的形势要求我们在“三支”“两军”工作中更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，加强无产阶级党性，克服形形色色的非无产阶级思想，始终不渝地用党性支左，坚定不移地彻底执行“支左不支派”的原则。这是革命的需要，形势的需要，阶级斗争的需要，是取得无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要。因此，在“三支”“两军”工作中，我们要特别警惕资产阶级和小资产阶级派性的干扰，必须随时随地和派性作不调和的斗争，坚定地站在无产阶级革命立场上，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，勇敢捍卫毛主席的最新指示。如果我们不是这样提出问题和认识问题，就会背离毛主席的最新指示，就会掉队，就会犯极大的错误。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是一条大毒蛇，是无产阶级文化大革命凶恶的敌人。有了派性，就没有坚定的党性，就不能贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示；有了派性，对大好形势就看不清，就会变成政治上的庸人；有了派性，就不顾整体，只顾为自己的小团体争名夺利；有了派性，就没有辨别是非的标准，分不出青红皂白，划不清界限；有了派性，就会闹意气，泄私愤，以感情代替政策，把矛头指向自己的同志和战友，迷失革命斗争的大方向，以至干出亲者痛、仇者快的坏事；有了派性，就容易为阶级敌人所利用，起着损害自己、包庇坏人的作用。派性这个罪大恶极的坏东西，来源于资产阶级、小资产阶级的自私自利性，完全是资产阶级党派竞争的腐朽作风，是“私”字的宠儿，是革命的大敌。它同无产阶级革命利益和毛主席的革命路线是水火不相容的。只有阶级敌人愿意我们保存派性。我们无产阶级革命派，是为着无产阶级革命利益，为着保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗的，绝不允许派性盘踞在我们头脑里。我们应当清醒地认识到：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志”。我们应当自觉地遵照毛主席的教导：“以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”，防止派性的侵蚀和影响，彻底打倒派性，树立坚强的无产阶级党性，做真正的无产阶级革命派。
    真正的无产阶级革命派，必须是对毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部无限热爱，无限忠诚；对毛主席和党中央的指示条条照办，句句照办，一切思想言行都要符合毛泽东思想。这是无产阶级党性最集中的表现，是无产阶级的最高利益。在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，我们一定要站在无产阶级党性立场上，用毛泽东思想支左。不论是那派革命群众组织，凡是符合毛泽东思想，符合毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的言论和行动，我们就坚决拥护，坚决支持。反之，我们就不支持，就要认真帮助，做艰苦、深入、细致的思想政治工作。这是我们共产党员、革命战士最崇高的职责，最光荣的战斗任务。
    坚持“支左不支派”的原则，关键在于活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，把毛主席的一系列极为重要的最新指示变为自觉行动。林副主席说：“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。”又说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”我们必须遵照林副主席的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大学大用“老五篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”这是千真万确的伟大真理。在我们头脑里没有真空，不是公，就是私；不是无产阶级党性，就是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性；不是突出无产阶级政治，就是突出资产阶级政治。“私”字不除，修根就挖不净；资产阶级、小资产阶级派性不打倒，无产阶级党性就树立不起来。因此，我们应当自觉地、狠狠地“斗私，批修”，从根本上打倒派性，加强党性。在灵魂深处树立起无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的赤胆红心，坚定不移地“站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场”，为全面落实毛主席最新指示，捍卫毛主席革命路线冲锋陷阵！
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。实践证明，凡是努力活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓世界观的改造，贯彻落实毛主席最新指示就最坚决，无产阶级党性就最坚强，“支左不支派”的原则就掌握得最好。在两派革命组织严重对立的情况下，就能狠斗私心杂念，不计较个人得失，坚持用毛泽东思想支左；在受到外来压力的时候，就能以党性战胜派性，就能遵循毛主席的指示，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“我”字换成“公”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”，积极支持和帮助无产阶级革命派；在两派革命群众组织中，当一派竭力宣扬自己正确的时候，才不会偏听偏信，才能帮助两派在毛泽东思想的原则基础上逐步联合起来；在帮助两派革命群众组织解决矛盾遭到非议时，就能把革命利益放在第一位，不意气用事，不以感情代替政策，坚持用毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示武装群众的头脑，使问题迅速得到解决。即使有时在思想上、工作上产生了缺点错误，也能“坚持真理，随时修正错误”，自觉地把问题上纲，认真检查，虚心听取群众的批评，及时克服缺点，改正错误。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”坚持“支左不支派”的原则，就一定要“大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作”。我们决心以在北京针织总厂执行支左任务的八三四一部队为榜样，以“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志为镜子，用毛泽东思想全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派，帮助无产阶级革命派，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，首先抓好活学活用毛主席的最新指示，加强无产阶级革命派队伍的思想革命化，从思想上巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。对两派革命群众组织之间的矛盾，决不片面地站在某一革命群众组织一边，更不允许支持一派，排挤一派，要通过活学活用毛主席著作，“斗私，批修”来解决；对重大问题的处理，一定要放到桌面上来解决，不背地自行其事，自搞一套；对犯过错误的老造反派，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，坚持帮助、批评、联合的原则，使他们真正在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下统一起来。我们一定要进一步学习毛主席的最新指示，做好支左中的思想政治工作，拜群众为师，恭恭敬敬地、老老实实地向群众学习，不断听取群众的批评，不断从群众中汲取政治营养，狠抓“三支”“两军”人员的思想革命化，使我们不管在任何情况下，不管遇到任何的干扰和冲击，都能够坚持“支左不支派”的原则，紧紧掌握革命斗争大方向。
    毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”在伟大的文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的大好形势下，一切阶级敌人是决不甘心灭亡的，他们还会千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱，企图利用革命队伍内的派性，制造事端，挑拨离间，破坏革命队伍团结。我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，一定要百倍提高革命警惕，坚决打倒派性，搞臭派性，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的任何阴谋诡计。我们要更加紧密地同其他支左部队一道，和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起。阶级敌人胆敢轻举妄动，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，遭到可耻的失败。
    “放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进”。展望一九六八年，将是取得更加辉煌、更加伟大胜利的一年。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，发扬成绩，克服缺点，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功！
