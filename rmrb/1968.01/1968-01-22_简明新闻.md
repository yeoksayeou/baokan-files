	Tens of thousands of Australian postal workers go on strike
	Nearly ten thousand mail sorters across Australia, defying various threats, began a strike on the evening of the 18th to support postal truck drivers who have been on strike for seven days demanding a wage increase.
	The Australian authorities attempted to hire temporary workers to drive the mail trucks, thereby undermining the strike by the postal drivers. The mail sorters announced their refusal to sort mail in protest against the government's actions to break the strike.
	Railway, dock, and transportation unions also announced that they would not transport any mail handled by non-postal union members, expressing solidarity with the striking postal workers.

	Portuguese students hold anti-American demonstration
	More than two hundred students in the northern Portuguese city of Oporto held a demonstration on the 17th to protest against American aggression in Vietnam. The demonstration took place while the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, Bennett, was in Oporto.
	The demonstrators, despite the presence of fully armed fascist police, engaged in a struggle with the police.

	West German youth protest against fare increases
	Young workers and students in Bremen, West Germany, have been holding large-scale demonstrations to protest against the increase in public bus and tram fares.
	Due to the West German government's efforts to delay the economic crisis by intensifying its attacks on the working people, prices in West Germany are rising across the board.
	Hundreds of young people in Bremen began protesting on the evening of the 15th, with the scale of the demonstrations growing larger. By the 17th, the number of young workers and students participating in the demonstrations reached three thousand. On the 18th, two thousand young people continued the demonstrations, causing traffic in the city center to come to a standstill.
