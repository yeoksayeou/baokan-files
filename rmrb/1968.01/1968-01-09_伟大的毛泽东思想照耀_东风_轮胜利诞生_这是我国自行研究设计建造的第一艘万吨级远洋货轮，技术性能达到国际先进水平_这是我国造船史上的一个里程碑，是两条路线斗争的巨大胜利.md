Under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's first self-designed and self-built 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship, the "Dongfeng," has undergone long-term operational tests and has recently been accepted by the State Acceptance Committee. This is a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The completion of the "Dongfeng" is a milestone in the development of China's shipbuilding industry. Looking at the history of shipbuilding around the world, foreign countries generally start from scratch, from small to large, from low to high, gradually upgrading, and often take several years to achieve each level. China's construction of the "Dongfeng" has leaped from medium-sized coastal cargo ships to 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ships, from 2,000-horsepower ship diesel engines to over 8,000-horsepower diesel engines, completing in just a few years what foreigners took decades to achieve. This development speed is unprecedented in history.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns." The entire process of research, design, and construction of the "Dongfeng" reflects the extremely sharp and complex struggle between the two lines in the shipbuilding industry. In 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The broad masses of workers in the shipbuilding industry, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, were determined to be self-reliant and strive for strength, using their own hands to build China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship and develop their own ocean-going fleet. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road have long opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, advocating a thoroughgoing line of capitulationism, placing their hopes on buying and leasing ships from abroad and importing equipment and purchasing patents. China's Khrushchev openly shouted, "Ocean-going ships need to be organized, and we can buy ships. If we have foreign exchange, we can do more." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing also jumped out, advocating, "The focus of shipbuilding should be on coastal and inland ships, and we don't necessarily need to build so many ocean-going ships." He also advocated the shameless nonsense of "If the East is not bright, the West will be, and we can buy some from capitalist countries." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the maritime department also vigorously promoted the line of "building ships is not as good as buying ships, and buying ships is not as good as leasing ships," attempting to obstruct the development of China's shipbuilding industry and shipbuilding technology.

The broad masses of workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard, Hudong Shipyard, and related ship design departments, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, were determined to self-design, self-build, and self-research 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ships. The main engine (an 8,820-horsepower large diesel engine) of this type of 10,000-ton cargo ship is a key component. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party actively advocated importing it from abroad or purchasing the patent. This proposal was firmly opposed by the broad revolutionary masses of workers in the shipbuilding industry. Workers and technical personnel united, studied Chairman Mao's works actively, and firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings to be self-reliant in developing industrial construction. In the absence of materials and experience, they completed the research, design, and trial production of the main engine in a very short time. However, that handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and some bourgeois technical "authorities" did not believe in the wisdom of the masses, using their authority to forcibly order the already processed crankshaft of the diesel engine, a key component, to be put in "cold storage," along with other reasons, forcing the "Dongfeng" to stop work for several years. In 1965, the revolutionary workers of the Jiangnan and Hudong shipyards, the ship design units, and the maritime department, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," rose up to defend the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and resumed the production of the "Dongfeng." The broad revolutionary masses, with deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao, displayed boundless enthusiasm and completed the entire project at a speed that broke conventional norms.

The "Dongfeng" has undergone trials and long-term operations, facing huge waves, ten-level winds, and severe ice and snow. It has sailed over 30,000 nautical miles and transported nearly 300,000 tons of cargo. Practice has proven that the "Dongfeng" has excellent quality and its technical performance has reached the advanced level of similar foreign ships.

Recently, the "Dongfeng" has been appraised by the state and is about to take on new combat missions. The crew members said excitedly: The "Dongfeng" is a seeder of Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely be on the ship, with our hearts in the motherland and our eyes on the world, driving the "Dongfeng" to spread the great thought of Mao Zedong around the world, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the skies of the five continents and the four oceans.

    伟大的毛泽东思想照耀“东风”轮胜利诞生
    这是我国自行研究设计建造的第一艘万吨级远洋货轮，技术性能达到国际先进水平
    这是我国造船史上的一个里程碑，是两条路线斗争的巨大胜利
    据新华社八日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，我国第一艘自行研究、设计、建造的万吨级远洋货轮——“东风”轮，经过了长期营运考验，最近由国家验收委员会验收。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    “东风”轮的建成，是我国造船工业发展史上的一个里程碑。打开世界造船史，国外自行设计、建造轮船，一般都是从无到有，从小到大，从低到高，逐步升级，而每升一级，往往要经过好几年时间才能办到。我国建造“东风”轮，是从中小型沿海货轮跃为万吨远洋货轮，从两千马力船用柴油机跃为八千多马力柴油机，短短几年就走完了外国人几十年才走完的路程。这个发展速度是史无前例的。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”“东风”轮的整个研究、设计、建造过程，集中地反映了造船工业战线上两条路线的极其尖锐复杂的斗争。一九五八年，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。造船工业的广大职工，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，决心自力更生，奋发图强，用自己的双手建造我国第一艘万吨级远洋货轮，发展自己的远洋船队。但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，长期以来，极力抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，奉行一条彻头彻尾的卖国主义路线，把希望寄托在靠从国外买船、租船和进口设备、购买专利上面。中国赫鲁晓夫公开叫嚷“远洋船要组织，可以买船，有外汇可以多搞一点”。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿也跳出来叫嚣：“造船重点搞沿海和内河的船，远洋船不一定搞那么多”。他还鼓吹什么“东方不亮西方亮，可以从资本主义国家买一点嘛”的无耻谰言。航运部门党内一小撮走资派也极力推行“造船不如买船，买船不如租船”的卖国主义路线，妄图阻挡我国造船工业和造船技术的发展。
    上海江南造船厂、沪东造船厂以及有关船舶设计部门的广大职工，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，决心自行研究、设计、建造万吨级远洋货轮。这种万吨货轮的主机（八千八百二十马力的大型柴油机）是个关键，党内一小撮走资派积极主张从国外进口，或者向国外购买专利。这种主张遭到造船工业广大革命职工的坚决抵制。造船工人和技术人员团结在一起，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席教导的要自力更生发展工业建设的精神，在缺乏资料，缺少经验的情况下，用很短的时间完成了主机的研究、设计和试制任务。但是，那一小撮党内走资派和一些资产阶级技术“权威”不相信群众的智慧，利用职权，强行下令把已加工好的柴油机曲轴这个关键部件打入“冷宫”，加上其他的原因，迫使“东风”轮停工达数年之久。一九六五年，上海江南、沪东两个造船厂、船舶设计单位以及航运部门的革命职工，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，奋起捍卫大跃进的成果，恢复了“东风”轮的生产。广大革命职工怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，发挥了冲天干劲，以打破常规的高速度完成了全部工程。
    “东风”轮在试航和长期营运中，曾经经受过滔天巨浪、十级大风、冰雪严寒的考验，航程达三万多浬，货运量近三十万吨。实践证明，“东风”轮的质量优良，技术性能达到了国外同类船舶的先进水平。
    最近，“东风”轮经国家鉴定，即将投入新的战斗任务。船员们怀着极其兴奋的心情说：“东风”轮是毛泽东思想的播种机，我们一定要身在船上，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，驾着“东风”轮，把伟大的毛泽东思想传遍全世界，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在五大洲、四大洋的上空高高飘扬。
