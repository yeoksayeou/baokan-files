According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: On the 18th, the spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front issued a statement strongly condemning the outrageous crime of U.S. imperialist and Lao rightist bandit planes bombing the Miao village region of Yunnan, China, on the 7th.

The statement said that the Laotian Patriotic Front and the people of Laos are extremely indignant about this war provocation by U.S. imperialism and the Lao rightists, and strongly protest and condemn their heinous crime against the Chinese people.

The statement pointed out that this war provocation by U.S. imperialism and the Lao rightists against the People's Republic of China is not an isolated incident. All the frenzied actions of U.S. imperialism are aimed at expanding the war of aggression to the entire Laos and Cambodia, and to the People's Republic of China, in an attempt to extricate itself from the dire straits of its heavy defeat in South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that the great Chinese people, in their heroic struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, have dealt it the heaviest blows. The war provocations of U.S. imperialism will surely be smashed by the Chinese people.

The statement emphasized that the Chinese people are very close friends of the Laotian people and have consistently supported and aided the Laotian people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The wholehearted support of the Chinese people for the Laotian people has deeply moved and greatly excited the Laotian people.

The statement continued, saying that the Laotian Patriotic Front and the people of Laos fully support the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on January 12, 1968, and firmly demand that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos must immediately stop all war provocations against the People's Republic of China.

The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: If they persist in their war provocations against the People's Republic of China, intensify and expand their aggression in Vietnam and Laos, and provoke the Kingdom of Cambodia, then the Laotian people will further strengthen their unity with the peoples of the aforementioned brotherly countries and resolutely give them the punishment they deserve.

    美帝的挑衅必将受到严厉惩罚
    新华社康开二十二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十八日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义和老挝右派的强盗飞机七日对中国云南苗寨地区进行轰炸的滔天罪行。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党和老挝全国人民对美帝国主义和老挝右派的这一战争挑衅行动感到无比愤慨，并且强烈抗议和谴责它们对中国人民所犯下的这一滔天罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和老挝右派对中华人民共和国的这一战争挑衅行动，决不是偶然事件。美帝国主义的一切疯狂行动，都是阴谋把侵略战争扩大到整个老挝和柬埔寨，扩大到中华人民共和国，妄图摆脱它在越南南方遭到惨重失败的困境。
    声明指出，伟大的中国人民在反对帝国主义，特别是在反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争中，给予它以最沉重的打击。美帝国主义的战争挑衅行动，必将被中国人民所粉碎。
    声明强调说，中国人民是老挝人民十分亲密的朋友，一贯支持和帮助老挝人民的抗美救国斗争。中国人民对老挝人民的全心全意的支持，使老挝人民深受感动和无比兴奋。
    声明接着说，老挝爱国战线党和老挝全国人民完全支持中华人民共和国外交部一九六八年一月十二日的声明，坚决要求美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗必须立即停止对中华人民共和国的一切战争挑衅行动。
    声明严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗：如果它们顽固地坚持对中华人民共和国进行战争挑衅，加强和扩大在越南和老挝的侵略战争，对柬埔寨王国进行挑衅，那末，老挝人民将同上述各兄弟国家人民进一步加强团结，坚决给它们以应得的惩罚。
