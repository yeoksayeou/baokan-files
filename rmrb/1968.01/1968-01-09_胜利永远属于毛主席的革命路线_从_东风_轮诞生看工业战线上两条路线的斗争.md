The "Dongfeng" ship, a far-reaching cargo vessel of great significance in China's shipbuilding history, how was it built?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any new thing's growth is bound to encounter twists and turns. In socialist undertakings, to think that one can avoid difficulties and twists and turns, pay no great effort, and always sail smoothly to achieve success easily is just an illusion."

The "Dongfeng" ship was born amidst the twists and turns of a fierce struggle between two lines.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, there have always been two fundamentally opposed lines on the question of how to develop shipbuilding technology.

One is the proletarian revolutionary line taught by Chairman Mao: to muster great efforts, strive to be ahead, rely on self-reliance, strive for strength, set high aspirations, and catch up with and surpass the advanced scientific and technological level of the world. This revolutionary line is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and make shipbuilding technology serve proletarian politics, serve the construction of a great socialist power, and serve the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, supporting the world's revolutionary people.

The other is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by China's Khrushchev. This line vehemently opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, opposes emphasizing proletarian politics, opposes mass movements, opposes the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, opposes self-reliance, promotes slavery, crawling, and abolitionism, opposes catching up with and surpassing the advanced scientific and technological level of the world, and advocates buying and renting ships to kneel and surrender to imperialism and revisionism, attempting to restore capitalism in China and make China return to the old path of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The research, design, and construction of the "Dongfeng" ship were all carried out in the sharp struggle between these two lines.

Walking the Path of Self-Reliance

Is the development of the shipbuilding industry reliant on self-reliance or on foreign countries? Is the development of China's shipping industry reliant on domestic shipbuilding or on buying and renting ships from abroad? This is an important aspect of the struggle between the two lines. This struggle has always been present throughout the research, design, and construction of the "Dongfeng" ship.

As early as 1945, Chairman Mao taught us: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creativity of all military and civilian personnel." "What is our policy based on? It is based on our own strength, which is self-reliance."

In 1958, Chairman Mao instructed that we must vigorously develop the shipbuilding industry and build a large number of ships. Chairman Mao's instructions, like the sun, illuminated our hearts and pointed out our direction, showing us the only correct path for the development of China's shipbuilding industry.

In 1958, inspired by Chairman Mao's general line for socialist construction, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard, Hudong Shipyard, and relevant ship design departments, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, aimed to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level, broke away from superstitions, liberated their minds, swept away all foreign frameworks, and decided to take the path of self-reliance. They issued the heroic oath: "Set high aspirations, be determined, attack the cutting edge, climb the peak, and definitely capture the ten-thousand-ton ship." They bravely undertook the glorious task of building China's first ten-thousand-ton far-sea cargo ship.

However, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, did the opposite. They opposed self-reliance and pinned their hopes on introducing technology, importing equipment, and purchasing patents. They openly opposed Chairman Mao's important instructions on developing the shipbuilding industry and vigorously peddled the line of selling out the country. China's Khrushchev shouted, "Far-sea ships need to be organized; we can buy ships, and if we have foreign exchange, we can do more." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Rongquan also shouted, "The focus of shipbuilding should be on coastal and inland ships; far-sea ships do not need to be built so many." Under the influence of this black line, some people vigorously advocated, "Building ships is not as good as buying ships, and buying ships is not as good as renting ships," slandering the shipbuilding industry as "high cost, long cycle, poor quality," attempting to strangle China's shipbuilding industry.

Regarding the main engine, the heart of the ten-thousand-ton ship, should it be researched, designed, and manufactured domestically, or should it rely on imports? A fierce struggle unfolded around this issue.

One opinion held that the main engine of the ten-thousand-ton ship is a high-power diesel engine with very high technical requirements. Only a few capitalist countries in the world can manufacture it, and even they took several decades to go from manufacturing small diesel engines to manufacturing large diesel engines. By 1958, China's diesel engine manufacturing industry had only just begun to manufacture two-thousand-horsepower ship diesel engines. On this basis, it was impossible to suddenly leap to manufacturing an eight-thousand-horsepower large diesel engine. Therefore, someone proposed buying a foreign engine and installing it on the ship.

However, the vast majority of workers and technicians believed that the main engine is the heart of the ship. If there is no domestically produced main engine, the shipbuilding industry's path of self-reliance would be empty talk. We must make a firm decision to establish China's large diesel engine manufacturing industry.

At this critical moment, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power in China's shipbuilding industry, acting on China's Khrushchev's instructions, used their authority to invite a foreign patent dealer to negotiate the purchase of a diesel engine patent. According to the terms of this patent, if we bought their drawings and data, we could only arrange production according to their drawings and data. China would have no right to design and manufacture new diesel engines in the same factory or to export diesel engines produced under the patent. What was even more infuriating was that they not only extorted China economically at a price much higher than that sold to capitalist and revisionist countries but also unreasonably demanded the right to arbitrarily inspect relevant production accounts in the factory. In case of a dispute, they would have to submit to their laws and arbitration.

The harsh conditions proposed by the foreign patent dealer ignited the determination of China's shipbuilding workers to strive for national glory. Under the conditions of lacking data and experience, the technicians participating in the research and design completed the research and design tasks of the main engine in a very short time. Immediately afterward, Hudong Shipyard used methods like ants gnawing on bones to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, overcoming one difficulty after another, skipping the stage of manufacturing non-supercharged diesel engines, and successfully trial-manufactured a large supercharged diesel engine, turning a new page for China's diesel engine manufacturing industry.

When the main engine assembly was completed, during the platform test, the transmission chain and supercharger on the main engine malfunctioned. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois technical "authorities" immediately jumped out to spread cold winds and pour cold water, spreading pessimistic and despairing sentiments everywhere. They said, "Those old diesel engine manufacturing countries also import superchargers and chains from specialized factories. We want to tackle these two hard bones; it's not that easy. It's better to import them!" This argument was immediately strongly opposed by the vast majority of workers and technicians. They pointed out that the growth of new things is not smooth sailing, the road is paved by people, and success is achieved through failure. Failure seems to be a bad thing but can increase knowledge and skills. They made a firm decision to persist with a spirit of daring to venture, with the assistance of Shanghai Steam Turbine Boiler Research Institute, Dalong Machinery Factory, and other brother units, working day and night, and finally solved the problems of the supercharger and the large chain, making the platform test a success.

Class struggle does not change with people's will. On the day the main engine trial-manufacturing succeeded, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois technical "authorities" were still unwilling to admit defeat. They again attempted to produce foreign-type diesel engines to squeeze out the production of domestic diesel engines. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers across the country rose up in rebellion, thoroughly exposing their treacherous deeds of betraying Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Catching Up with the World's Advanced Level

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of various countries in the world, crawling step by step behind others." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future."

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are the only correct course for the development of China's science and technology and the beacon guiding our victorious advance.

Is the development of China's shipbuilding industry to follow Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, break the rules, catch up, and stand on the principle of surpassing, blazing a trail that no one has walked before; or to follow the old path of shipbuilding industries of various countries in the world, crawl behind others, copy from others, and practice crawling?

This is another important aspect of the struggle between the two lines in the shipbuilding industry, and this struggle is also reflected in the construction of the "Dongfeng" ship.

Opposite to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Rongquan vigorously promoted slavery, crawling, and abolitionism, saying, "Now others are doing high and fast, we should temporarily do low and slow, and not finish the work of our sons and grandsons." They viciously attacked the Great Leap Forward, criticizing the shipbuilding industry for having too many varieties, too long a front, and too fast development, not based on reality. They also forced the shipbuilding industry to "give way." In short, they only allowed crawling, not leaping forward; only allowed backwardness, not revolution. Under their command, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and some bourgeois technical "authorities" who believed in foreigners and did not believe in their own strength also made a big fuss and spread cold winds on the issue of whether the "Dongfeng" ship should catch up or not. They believed that the current task of China's shipbuilding industry was to solve the problem of having or not having, not the problem of catching up. In their eyes, we had never designed large ships before, nor did we have complete sets of reference materials. Moreover, from coastal medium-sized ships to ten-thousand-ton far-sea ships, and from steam engines to large low-speed diesel engines, it generally took decades in foreign countries. We wanted to build them in just a few years, which was impossible.

However, they could not understand at all how powerful people armed with Mao Zedong Thought could be! Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it will produce tremendous material force. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "break away from superstitions and liberate the mind," China's shipbuilding workers and engineering and technical personnel dared to think and act, dared to walk the path that no one had walked before, dared to climb the peak of world science and technology, and were determined to march into scientific research to compete with capitalist countries.

Catch up with what? Surpass what? We must not compete with foreigners in luxury and decoration, pursuing the capitalist way. We must not detach from reality and set requirements beyond the limits allowed by objective conditions but, within the limits allowed by objective conditions, actively strive for the greatest victory. The engineering and technical personnel of the scientific research and design department, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, collected and analyzed a large amount of domestic and foreign data. Based on the principle of aiming to surpass and standing on domestic resources, they determined to take speed, load factor, etc., as the main targets for catching up.

First, start with speed. Technicians, based on China's cargo transportation needs, analyzed nine countries' fifteen representative ship types and, after a series of ship model tests, selected the indicator of a speed of seventeen nautical miles per hour, entering the ranks of international standards. The use of high-strength low-alloy steel is an important measure to solve the above load factor. At that time, China did not have such shipbuilding alloy steel. The revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, hearing that China was going to build ten-thousand-ton ships, used domestic resources in a short period to trial-manufacture shipbuilding high-strength low-alloy steel.

There were some technical "authorities" who measured a thing often with one sentence, "How is it in foreign countries?" They believed in foreign things but found faults with and poured cold water on domestic things. The important equipment for controlling the direction, the rudder machine, generally used variable oil pump hydraulic rudder machines abroad. Our technicians, in the research and design, based on domestic resources, displayed their creativity, and the hydraulic part adopted a quantitative oil pump. This creative spirit of breaking foreign frameworks scared those foreign-admiring technical "authorities." They openly opposed it, using the excuse that the rudder machine must be absolutely reliable. However, practice proved that this rudder machine not only had good quality but also had the advantages of being flexible to operate and quick to respond, and the crew welcomed it. This innovation gave those bourgeois technical "authorities" a resounding slap in the face.

The Masses Are the True Heroes

Our great leader Chairman Mao most believes in the masses, most relies on the masses, is best at mobilizing the masses, and most respects the masses' pioneering spirit. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, treated the masses as "Ah Dou" and themselves as "Zhuge Liang," slandering the mass movement as "rising in a rush," "irregular," and "guerrilla habits," and using every means to suppress the mass movement.

Facts are the best witnesses. The completion of the "Dongfeng" ship is the result of a great mass movement and a great victory of Chairman Mao's mass line.

In 1959, the broad masses of workers on the shipbuilding front launched a magnificent mass movement to fight for the "Dongfeng" ship. However, during the construction of the "Dongfeng" ship, a struggle over whether to believe in the masses or the "experts," whether to rely on workers or bourgeois technical "authorities," was also taking place.

The diesel engine crankshaft is a key component, the key of the key. Its characteristics are heavy, large, and precise. One crankshaft weighs seventy-five tons and is made up of many sections that are processed and fitted together. The diameters of the fitted shafts must not differ by even half the thickness of a hair, so the technical requirements for processing are very high. Those technical "authorities" were also stumped by this difficulty. However, the workers of Shanghai Hudong Shipyard posted big-character posters, proudly proposing the slogan, "Big difficulties, big solutions; small difficulties, small solutions; difficulties, solutions; revolutionary heroes face no difficulties," breaking through one technical difficulty after another and finally completing the crankshaft processing task. At this time, those bourgeois technical "authorities" still did not believe in the wisdom of the masses and found various reasons why the new crankshaft could not be used, finally exercising their authority to sentence the crankshaft to "death," forcing the trial production of the diesel engine to be delayed by nearly two years.

Although those bourgeois technical "authorities" had given the crankshaft a "verdict," the workers were not reconciled. In their minds, the crankshaft was not scrapped. They said, "If you don't let me use it on the ship, I'll use it for testing." After using it for testing, they carefully oiled and sealed it for storage, like cherishing a baby. It was not until this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that, through the strong demands and scientific tests of the workers, this crankshaft that had been banished to the "cold palace" regained its youth and was used in a new diesel engine.

During the days of fighting for the "Dongfeng" ship, moving deeds happened every day and everywhere. The technicians fighting on the scientific research and design front, following Chairman Mao's teaching that correct ideas can only come from practice, carried out extensive investigations and research, widely implemented the "three-in-one combination," and completed all research and design tasks in a short time. The shipbuilding workers fighting on the "Dongfeng" ship issued the heroic slogan, "Strive to be ahead, catch the tide, those who do not strive and catch up are not heroes." To manufacture an 8,820-horsepower diesel engine, the workers issued the heroic oath, "Strive for national glory" and "Strive for the dignity of the working class." They all used their brains, every group carried out innovations, carried out a thousand innovations using local methods, overcame numerous difficulties, and broke through one after another, finally successfully trial-manufacturing this large diesel engine. To build the "Dongfeng" ship as soon as possible, everyone wanted to contribute their strength. Those who did not work on the ship worked on it in their spare time during the day; those who could not do fine work did auxiliary work. Some workers worked day and night in shifts. This greatly shortened the shipyard cycle. The fierce struggle that unfolded around the "Dongfeng" ship was not just about one ship but about the future of China's shipbuilding industry and shipping industry, and about where China's economic construction was heading. This was a struggle over the political line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the industrial front. The trial production work of the "Dongfeng" ship encountered great resistance, many difficulties, and even once faced the misfortune of stopping work and "soaking the ship." What was the cause? Who was the culprit? Now it is clear: it was China's Khrushchev and his gang who extended their black hands into the shipbuilding industry and shipping industry. China's Khrushchev and his gang, using the authority they had stolen, blocked Chairman Mao's instructions, resisted the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, suppressed the mass movement, and carried out counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist crimes. Their actions were to restore capitalism in the shipbuilding industry and shipping industry.

During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, were dragged out. The revolutionary workers of the shipbuilding industry and shipping industry were extremely excited. They built the "Dongfeng" ship with their hardworking hands, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao and writing an immortal chapter in China's shipbuilding history. This brilliant achievement shows: Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes a great material force for changing the world. When we celebrate our victory, we must always remember the course of the fierce struggle between the two lines on the "Dongfeng" ship and, as instructed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

Victory belongs forever to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    胜利永远属于毛主席的革命路线
    ——从“东风”轮诞生看工业战线上两条路线的斗争
    严伟惠
    “东风”轮，这艘在我国造船工业史上具有重大意义的远洋货轮，是怎样建成的？
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    “东风”轮，就是在艰难曲折的两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，在如何发展造船工业技术的问题上，始终存在着两条根本对立的路线。
    一条是毛主席所教导的鼓足干劲，力争上游，自力更生，奋发图强，树雄心，立壮志，赶超世界先进科学技术水平的无产阶级革命路线。这条革命路线，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，相信群众，依靠群众，使造船工业技术为无产阶级政治服务，为建设伟大的社会主义强国服务，为反对帝国主义和修正主义，支援世界人民革命斗争服务。
    另一条是以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线。这条路线，极力反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对大搞群众运动，反对阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，反对自力更生，推行奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义，反对赶超世界先进科学技术水平，竭力鼓吹买船租船，向帝国主义、修正主义屈膝投降，妄图在我国实现资本主义复辟，使我国重新退到半殖民地半封建社会的老路上去。“东风”轮的研究、设计、建造，就是在这两条路线的尖锐斗争中进行的。
    走自力更生的道路
    发展造船工业是依靠自力更生，还是依靠外国？发展我国的航运事业是靠国内自己造船，还是靠从国外买船租船？这是两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。这个斗争，始终贯串在“东风”轮的研究、设计、建造过程中。
    毛主席早在一九四五年就教导我们：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”
    一九五八年，毛主席指示我们必须大搞造船工业，大量造船。毛主席的指示，象太阳一样，照亮了我们的心，指出了我们的航向，是发展我国造船工业唯一正确的道路。
    一九五八年，在毛主席提出的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，上海江南造船厂、沪东造船厂以及有关船舶设计部门的广大革命职工，以毛泽东思想为武器，以赶超世界先进水平为目标，破除迷信，解放思想，横扫一切洋框框，决心走自力更生的道路，发出了“树雄心，立壮志，攻尖端，攀高峰，坚决拿下万吨轮”的英雄誓言，勇敢地承担了建造我国第一艘万吨级远洋货轮的光荣任务。
    但是，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，却反其道而行之。他们反对自力更生，把希望寄托在引进技术、进口设备与购买专利上面，公开反对毛主席关于发展造船工业的重要指示，竭力兜售卖国主义路线。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么“远洋船要组织，可以买船，有外汇可以多搞一点”。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿也叫嚣：“造船重点搞沿海和内河的船，远洋船不一定搞那么多”。在这条黑线的影响下，有些人就竭力鼓吹“造船不如买船，买船不如租船”，诬蔑造船工业“造价高、周期长、质量差”，妄图扼杀我国造船工业。
    作为万吨轮心脏的主机，究竟是自行研究、设计制造，还是依靠进口？围绕这个问题，展开了一场激烈的斗争。
    一种意见认为，万吨轮的主机是一部大马力柴油机，技术要求很高。世界上少数几个能够制造的资本主义国家，从制造小型柴油机到制造大柴油机，也还经历了几十年的时间；我国的柴油机制造工业，到一九五八年，才开始制造两千马力船用柴油机，在这个基础上，一下跃到制造八千多马力大型增压柴油机，是不可能的。因此，曾有人提议向国外买一台装上船再说。
    而绝大多数的工人和技术人员认为，主机是船舶的心脏，如果没有国产的主机，造船工业要走自力更生的道路只是一句空话。必须下定决心，建立我国的大型柴油机制造业。
    正在这个关键时刻，盘踞在我国造船工业领导岗位上的党内一小撮走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，利用职权，请来了一个外国专利商，谈判购买柴油机的专利。按照这个专利条款规定，如果买他们的图纸资料，就只能按他们的图纸资料安排生产，我国无权再在同一个工厂自行设计制造新的柴油机，也无权出口按专利生产的柴油机。更令人气愤的是，他们不仅以比卖给资本主义、修正主义国家高得多的价格对我国进行经济上的勒索，还无理提出要允许他们任意来厂检查有关的生产账目，发生争执还要服从他们的法律与仲裁。
    外国专利商提出的苛刻条件，激发了我国造船工业职工为国争光的决心。参加研究设计的技术人员在缺乏资料和经验的条件下，只用很短的时间，完成了主机的研究设计任务。紧接着沪东造船厂又用蚂蚁啃骨头等办法，大搞技术革新和技术革命，克服了一个又一个困难，跳过制造非增压柴油机的阶段，试制出了大型增压柴油机，为我国柴油机制造业揭开了新的一页。
    当主机装配完成以后，在平台的试验过程中，主机上的传动大链条和增压器这两个部件一度发生了故障。这时，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”立即跳出来大吹冷风，大泼冷水，到处散布悲观失望情绪。他们说：“那些老牌制造柴油机国家，也是从专门工厂进口增压器与链条的。我们要啃这两块硬骨头，那有这么容易。还是进口算了吧！”这种论调，当即遭到广大工人和技术人员的强烈反对。他们指出，新生事物的成长是不会一帆风顺的，路是人走出来的，成功是失败中闯出来的，失败看来是个坏事，却能长见识，增才干。他们下定决心，坚持一个“闯”字，在上海汽轮机锅炉研究所、大隆机器厂等兄弟单位的大力协助下，夜以继日地苦干，终于解决了增压器和大链条的故障问题，使平台试验获得成功。
    阶级斗争是不以人们的意志为转移的。就在主机试制成功之日，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”仍不甘心失败，他们又以仿制外国型号柴油机来排挤国产柴油机的生产。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工纷纷起来造反，这才把他们这种背叛毛主席革命路线的罪恶勾当彻底暴露在光天化日之下。
    赶超世界先进水平
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。”毛主席还教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”
    毛主席的这些英明指示，是我国发展科学技术唯一正确的航道，是我们胜利前进的指路明灯。
    发展我国的造船工业是遵照毛主席的光辉思想，打破常规，迎头赶上，立足于超，闯出一条前人没有走过的道路；还是走世界各国造船工业的老路，跟在别人的屁股后面，照着葫芦画瓢，实行爬行主义？这是造船工业两条路线斗争的又一重要方面，这个斗争同样反映在“东风”轮的建造过程中。
    同毛主席的革命路线相反，中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，竭力宣扬奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义，胡说什么：“现在人家搞高的、快的，我们就暂时搞低的、慢的，不要把儿子、孙子们的事情都干完了。”他们恶毒攻击大跃进，指责造船工业品种太多，战线太长，发展太快，不从实际出发。并且强迫造船工业“让路”。总之一句话，就是只准爬行，不准跃进；只准落后，不准革命。在他们挥舞的指挥棒下，党内一小撮走资派和一些迷信外国、不相信自己力量的资产阶级技术“权威”，在“东风”轮要不要赶超的问题上，也大作文章，大吹冷风，认为我国造船工业当前要解决的是有和无的问题，而不是赶超问题。在他们看来，我们从来没有设计过大船，也没有可参考的成套完整资料，而且从沿海中型船舶到万吨远洋轮船，从蒸汽机到大马力低速柴油机，在外国一般都经历了几十年的时间，我们要在短短的几年内造出来，是不可能的。
    但是，他们根本无法理解，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，能够发挥出多么大的威力！毛泽东思想一旦为广大人民群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量。我国造船工人和工程技术人员在毛主席“破除迷信解放思想”的伟大号召下，敢想敢闯，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登世界科学技术高峰，决心向科学研究进军，同资本主义国家比个高低。
    赶什么？超什么？我们决不能跟外国比豪华，比装饰，搞资本主义那一套。也不能脱离实际，超越客观条件许可的限度去提要求，而是在客观条件许可的限度内，能动地去争取最大的胜利。科研设计部门的工程技术人员通过活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为指导，大量收集和分析国内外的资料，在着眼于超，立足于国内资源的原则下，确定以快速性、载重量系数等方面为赶超的主要目标。
    首先从快速性入手。技术人员根据我国货运要求，分析了九个国家十五种代表船型，并经过一系列的船模试验，选定了航速每小时十七浬的指标，跨进了国际水平行列。采用高强度低合金钢，是解决上述载重量系数的重要措施。当时我国还没有这种船用合金钢材，鞍山钢铁公司革命职工听到我国要自造万吨轮船，在较短的时间内，利用国产资源把船用高强度低合金钢试制出来了。
    有这样一些技术“权威”，他们衡量一件事物的标准，往往只有一句话，“外国的怎么样”，外国的，他们信得过，自己搞的，就百般刁难，大泼冷水。掌握航向的重要设备舵机，国外一般都用变量油泵的液压舵机，我们的技术人员在研究设计中，根据国内的资源，发扬了独创精神，其液压部分采用了定量油泵。这种打破洋框框的独创精神，把一些崇洋的技术“权威”吓坏了。他们以舵机必须保证绝对可靠为借口，公然反对。但是，实践证明，这种舵机不但质量良好，而且具有操纵灵、舵效快的优点，船员极为欢迎。这一创举，给了那些资产阶级技术“权威”一记响亮的耳光。
    群众是真正的英雄
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最善于放手发动群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派却把群众当作“阿斗”，把他们自己当作“诸葛亮”，污蔑群众运动是“一轰而起”，“不正规”，“游击习气”，千方百计地扼杀群众运动。
    事实是最好的见证，“东风”轮的建成，就是大搞群众运动的结果，是毛主席的群众路线的伟大胜利。
    一九五九年，造船工业战线上的广大职工掀起了大战“东风”轮的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。但是就在“东风”轮的建造过程中，一场相信群众还是相信“专家”、依靠工人还是依靠技术“权威”的斗争也同时在进行着。
    柴油机曲轴是关键部件之一，是“东风”轮的关键的关键。它的特点是重、大、精。一根曲轴重达七十五吨，是由不少节加工并套接而成的，套接起来的各轴轴径不能相差半根头发丝那么粗细，因此加工的技术要求很高。那些技术“权威”又被这个困难难住了。可是上海沪东造船厂的工人们贴出大字报，豪迈地提出“大困难大办法，小困难小办法，有困难有办法，革命英雄面前无困难”的口号，突破了一个又一个技术难关，终于完成了曲轴加工任务。就在这时，那些资产阶级技术“权威”仍然不相信群众的智慧，对这根新生的曲轴，百般挑剔，寻找种种不能用的理由，最后行使职权，把这根曲轴宣判了“死刑”，迫使柴油机的试制进度推迟近两年之久。
    尽管那些资产阶级技术“权威”给曲轴下了“结论”，而工人们并不甘心，在他们的心目中，曲轴根本没有报废。他们说：“你不让我装船用，我就试车用。”当试车用完后，他们又象爱护婴儿一样，把这根曲轴仔细地上油密封保管好。直到这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，经过工人们的强烈要求和科学考验，才使这根打入“冷宫”的曲轴恢复了青春，用到了新的柴油机上。
    在为“东风”轮奋战的日子里，动人的事迹天天有，处处有。战斗在科研设计战线上的技术人员，按照毛主席关于正确的思想只能从实践中来的教导，大搞调查研究，广泛实行三结合，在短短时间内就完成了全部研究设计任务。战斗在“东风”轮上的造船工人发出了“上游要争，潮水要赶，不争不赶，算不了英雄好汉”的豪言壮语。为制造八千八百二十马力柴油机，工人们发出了“为国争光”，“为工人阶级争气”的英雄誓言。他们人人动脑筋，组组闹革新，大搞土法上马，革新一千多项，克服了重重困难，闯过了道道难关，终于试制成功了这台大型柴油机。为了早日把“东风”轮造出来，谁都想贡献一份力量。不在船上工作的同志，白天不能干，就在业余时间上船干；精活、细活干不了，就干辅助工作。有的工人夜以继日连班干。因而大大缩短了船台周期。围绕着“东风”轮展开的这一场激烈的斗争，绝不仅是一艘船的问题，而是关系到我国造船工业和航运事业的前途问题，是关系到我国经济建设向何处去的问题。这是无产阶级与资产阶级在工业战线上的一场政治路线斗争。“东风”轮的试制工作受到极大的阻力，遇到很多的困难，甚至一度遭遇停工“泡船”的厄运，究竟是什么原因？罪魁祸首是谁？现在已昭然若揭，是中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，是他们将黑手伸进了造船工业与航运事业。中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，利用所窃取的职权，封锁毛主席的指示，抗拒以毛主席为首的党中央的领导，压制群众运动，进行反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。他们的所作所为，就是要在造船工业和航运事业中复辟资本主义。
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派被揪了出来。造船工业和航运事业的广大革命职工无比振奋。他们用自己勤劳的双手建成的“东风”轮，表达了对毛主席的无限热爱，写下了中国造船史上不朽的篇章。这一光辉成就表明：毛泽东思想是无产阶级最强大的思想武器，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就变成改造世界的巨大物质力量。在我们欢呼胜利的时候，必须牢记“东风”轮上这场两条路线激烈斗争的战斗历程，一定要象林彪副主席所指示的那样：“念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”
    胜利永远属于毛主席的革命路线！
