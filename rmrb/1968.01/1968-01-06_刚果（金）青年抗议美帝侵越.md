A group of Congolese youth demonstrated on the 4th in the capital of the Mobutu regime in Kinshasa, vehemently protesting against U.S. aggression in Vietnam and strongly opposing the activities of U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey in Congo (Kinshasa).

The demonstration occurred as Humphrey arrived in Kinshasa. When Humphrey, under the tight protection of Mobutu's pseudo-military and police, was traveling from Kinshasa Airport to the city center, about 150 Congolese youth, despite the suppression by the pseudo-military and police, rushed forward, surrounded Humphrey's car, and shouted slogans such as, "We condemn U.S. crimes in Vietnam!" "Murderer, go back!" "Humphrey, go back!" The enraged youth also pounded on Humphrey's car with their fists. The Mobutu puppet regime immediately dispatched more pseudo-military to suppress the demonstration and rescued Humphrey.

    刚果（金）青年抗议美帝侵越
    一批刚果（金）青年四日在美帝走狗蒙博托集团统治中心金沙萨举行示威，愤怒抗议美国侵略越南的罪行，强烈反对美国副总统汉弗莱到刚果（金）活动。
    示威是在汉弗莱到达金沙萨时发生的。当汉弗莱在蒙博托伪军警严密保护下从金沙萨机场乘车前往市区途中，约一百五十名刚果青年不顾伪军警的镇压，冲上前去，围住汉弗莱的车子，高呼：“我们谴责美帝在越南的罪行！”“杀人犯，滚回去！”“汉弗莱，滚回去！”等口号。愤怒的青年还用拳头猛击汉弗莱的车子。蒙博托傀儡集团立即出动更多伪军进行镇压，把汉弗莱救走。
