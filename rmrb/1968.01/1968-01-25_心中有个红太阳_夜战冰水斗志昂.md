On the night of December 21, 1967, near the new pit of the red star coal mine in Fushun, a large industrial waste water pond suddenly burst through a water outlet more than two meters wide, and a torrent rushed towards the pit below. The water level in the pit continued to rise, and it seemed that the railway tracks in the pit would soon be submerged by the water, the mining electric pickaxes would be swallowed by the flood, and the oil shale and coal would be seriously threatened.

The soldiers of the 9th Company of a certain unit, who were tasked with the "three-in-one" and "two-in-one" missions in the Red Star Mine, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Facing the pit that was about to be swallowed by the flood, Deputy Commander Li Guangrong led everyone to loudly recite Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the interests of the people." Everyone solemnly swore to Chairman Mao: "We will definitely follow the example of the heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, and do as Chairman Mao instructs, advance as Chairman Mao waves his hand, and die to block the water outlet!"

Communist Party member Li Guangshou took the lead and jumped into the torrent. Then, the platoon leader Li Zhongmin, deputy platoon leader Kou Chaoxian, and soldiers Zhang Quanling, Qu Changhai, and four other comrades also jumped into the water, using their bodies to block the water outlet.

In the winter of the northern country, the cold wind howled. The comrades who were blocking the water outlet in the water, although their lower bodies were soaked in the icy torrent, and their upper bodies were resisting the cold wind of minus twenty-eight degrees Celsius, they were all spirited and full of fighting spirit. Although the young Communist League member Zhang Quanling was not in good health, he fought tenaciously with his comrades at the water outlet. He was determined to use his actions to severely criticize the philosophy of living for oneself of the Chinese Khrushchev. His boots and trousers were frozen together, his legs were numb, and it took a lot of effort to move a step. But he kept encouraging his fighting spirit and finally persisted to the end.

The ice water, like a vicious dragon, rushed from above to the pit below. One after another straw bags and frozen soil blocks were not even placed steadily before being swept away by the torrent. If the water outlet was not quickly blocked, the loss to the mine would be unimaginable. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army gritted their teeth and used their bodies to press down on the straw bags, forming a human dam to tightly block the straw bags and frozen soil blocks.

Under the leadership of Deputy Commander Li, the comrades responsible for transporting soil formed a rapid soil transport assault team. Each person carried frozen soil blocks and soil bags weighing hundreds of pounds, shouting the slogan "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and ran forward. Their clothes were all soaked with sweat.

More than 40 officers and soldiers fought for more than two hours and finally built a two-meter-high water dam, blocking the water outlet, protecting the electric pickaxes, and ensuring the safe production of the mine.

    心中有个红太阳　夜战冰水斗志昂
    一九六七年十二月二十一日夜晚，抚顺红星煤矿新屯页岩采场附近，一个工业大废水坑突然冲决两米多宽的水口，一股急流向采场坑下冲去。坑里水位不断上升，眼看着坑下铁道线路就要被水淹没，采矿的电镐即将被洪水吞掉，油母页岩和煤炭受到严重威胁。
    在红星矿担任“三支”、“两军”任务的某部九连指战员闻讯立即赶到现场。面对快要被洪水吞噬的矿坑，副连长李光荣带领大家高声背诵毛主席语录：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”大家庄严地向毛主席宣誓：“坚决象英雄四排和李文忠那样，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进，誓死堵住水口！”
    共产党员李光寿，一马当先，跳进激流。接着，班长黎忠民，副班长寇超贤，战士张全灵、曲长海等四位同志，也纵身跳进水中，用身体堵住水口。
    北国的冬天，寒风呼啸。在水里堵口子的同志们，虽然下半身浸泡在冰水激流中，上半身抗着摄氏零下二十八度的风寒，他们个个精神抖擞、斗志昂扬。共青团员张全灵身体不太好，但一直和战友们一样顽强地战斗在水口处。他决心用实际行动狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学。水靴和裤子冻结在一起了，腿麻木了，移动一步都要费很大力气。但他不断地鼓舞着自己的斗志，终于一直坚持到最后。
    冰水，象一条恶龙一样由高处向坑下猛冲，一个个的草袋子，一块块的冻土还没等放稳，就被激流卷走了。不赶紧堵住水口，场矿的损失就不堪设想。解放军同志个个咬紧牙关，用身体拚命地压在草袋子上，组成一道人堤，把草袋子、冻土块紧紧地挡住。
    负责运土的同志在副连长的带领下组成了一支快速运土突击队，每个人扛着百十斤重的冻土块、土袋子，口里高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的口号，跑步前进，一个个的衣服都被汗水湿透了。
    四十多名干部和战士，奋战两个多小时，终于筑起了一道二米高的水堤，堵住了水口，保住了电镐，保护了矿坑的安全生产。　邱石山　岳山红
