A Greek cargo ship braved the stormy seas to reach the port of Dalian in China. As soon as the ship docked, the Greek crew members eagerly recounted to the Chinese border inspection personnel their heroic struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought against the reactionary military police in Singapore.

Most of the crew members on this Greek cargo ship have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and an unlimited admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. They all possess Chairman Mao's works. Many crew members also have Chairman Mao's badges and portraits. They diligently read Chairman Mao's works and strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought. They treasure Chairman Mao's works as precious books and regard Chairman Mao's badges and portraits as treasures.

As soon as the cargo ship docked in Singapore, a group of about a dozen military police, armed with weapons, stormed onto the ship. The leader growled, "Search!" The thugs then began to rummage through everything, turning over boxes and drawers. They confiscated all copies of Chairman Mao's works, badges, and portraits they found. The crew members, enraged by this outrage, shouted in unison, "You can take away our Chairman Mao's works, but you can never take away Mao Zedong Thought from our minds!"

While the Singaporean reactionary military police were conducting their frenzied search, the ship's engineer quickly wrapped his beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in paper and cleverly hid it in a ventilation shaft outside his room. After the ship docked in Dalian, the engineer joyfully recounted the vivid scene of their struggle to preserve the revolutionary treasure against the enemy. He held the red treasure close to his chest and said excitedly, "No matter what difficulties I encounter in the future, I will definitely keep this treasure safe."

A machinery assistant put the several shiny Mao badges given to him by Chinese friends into a small iron box and hid it in the iron pipe corner of the engine room. After the ship entered Dalian, as soon as the machinery assistant saw the border inspection personnel board the ship, he held the preserved Mao badges in both hands and shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

He also selected the most exquisite Mao badge with the words "East Is Red" and presented it to one of our comrades as a lasting memento. When we gave him a shiny Mao badge in the shape of a five-star and a "Serve the People" badge from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he specially dressed in his holiday attire, respectfully wore them on his chest, and said with great emotion, "I will wear them on my chest and keep them in my heart forever. I will be like the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, always reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and wholeheartedly serving the Greek people and the people of the world. I will be a revolutionary fighter forever loyal to Chairman Mao!"

    勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想
    记希腊海员同新加坡反动军警进行英勇的斗争
    一艘希腊货轮冲破惊涛骇浪，到达我国大连港。这艘货船刚靠岸，希腊的船员们就争着向我边防检查站人员述说，他们在途经新加坡的时候，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，同当地反动军警进行英勇斗争的经过。
    这艘希腊货轮的大多数船员都无限热爱毛主席，无限敬仰毛泽东思想。他们都有毛主席著作。不少的船员还有毛主席像章和毛主席像。他们认真阅读毛主席著作，努力学习毛泽东思想。他们把毛主席著作视为宝书，把毛主席像章和毛主席像当作宝物。
    当这艘货轮刚在新加坡港停泊时，就有十几个军警手持武器，气势汹汹地冲到船上。为首的一个恶狠狠地说：“给我搜！”于是，这一伙暴徒就七手八脚地到处乱扒，翻箱倒柜。凡是见到毛主席著作、毛主席像章、毛主席像，都一律抄走。船员们面对这种暴行，怒不可遏，同声斥责暴徒们说：“你们夺去我们手中的毛主席著作，但是永远也夺不去我们头脑中的毛泽东思想！”
    当新加坡的反动军警在疯狂搜查的时候，这艘货轮的大车赶快把他心爱的《毛主席语录》用纸包起来，巧妙地藏在房间外面隐蔽处的一个通风筒里。货轮在大连停靠以后，这位大车高兴地讲述了他们为保住革命宝书与敌人进行斗争的生动场面。他把红色宝书贴在胸口，激动地说：“今后，不管遇到多大的艰险，我也一定要保住这本宝书。”
    一个轮机助理把中国朋友赠送给他的十几枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章装在一个小铁盒里，藏在机舱内铁管夹角处。货轮驶进大连以后，这位轮机助理一看见边防检查人员上船，就双手捧着保存下来的毛主席像章，用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    他还挑选了一枚有“东方红”字样的最精致的毛主席像章，赠送给我们的一个同志留作永久的纪念。当我们把中国人民解放军的五星形的金光闪闪的毛主席像章和“为人民服务”的毛主席语录章回赠他时，他特意穿上了节日的礼服，恭恭敬敬地戴在胸前，无比激动地说：“我要永远戴在胸前，挂在心上。我要象英雄的中国人民解放军那样，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，全心全意为希腊人民和世界人民服务，做永远忠于毛主席的革命战士！”
