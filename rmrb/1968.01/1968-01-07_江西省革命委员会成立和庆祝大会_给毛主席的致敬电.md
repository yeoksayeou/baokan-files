Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

Today, the red flag is raised high on Jinggangshan, and the waves of the Gan River surge with joy. We, the children of Jinggangshan, are filled with boundless joy and infinite passion as we report to you, the brightest red sun in our hearts, a piece of heart-stirring news: Under the nurturing of your brilliant thoughts, the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee has been born triumphantly amidst the storm of class struggle.

This is another brilliant victory for your proletarian revolutionary line!

This is another great triumph of your brilliant thoughts in the revolutionary old base area!

This is another magnificent achievement of the People's Liberation Army of China, which you personally created and led, in the "three supports, two militaries" work!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the vast sky cannot contain the boundless grace you have bestowed upon the children of Jinggangshan; the four seas cannot write down the boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty of the children of Jinggangshan for you. On this grand day when red flags wave like the sea and people surge like a tide, and the victory songs shake the mountains and rivers, our hearts surge with a thousand waves, and we sing "The East Is Red" with all our hearts. Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan sincerely wish you eternal life!

Respected Chairman Mao, Jiangxi is the first red revolutionary base area you established. Every blade of grass and tree here is filled with the deep affection of the children of Jinggangshan for you. Every mountain and river here records the victorious journey you led us through.

In the days when the Chinese working class was cruelly oppressed by the three great mountains, it was you, our most respected and beloved great leader, who came to Anshan time and time again, personally igniting the flames of revolution in the dark coal mines, and ringing the death knell of the old world. From then on, "the red flags fluttered under Mount Buzhou," the international anthem soared to the sky, and the Chinese workers' movement advanced victoriously along the direction you pointed!

At critical moments in the history of the Chinese revolution, it was you, our most respected and beloved great leader, who, with your towering strength, turned the tide of the revolution, raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and established the first revolutionary base area of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force on Jinggangshan. You created the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, a unique revolutionary armed force, and opened up a brilliant road of great historical significance for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

In the magnificent cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it was you, our most respected and beloved great leader, who called on us to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." The children of Jinggangshan remember your great teachings and have won one great victory after another on the political and ideological fronts. In the struggle to change heaven and earth, we rely on our own efforts, strive for strength, and transform the old into the new. Today, it is even more beautiful. On the red land, "the sky connects the five ridges with silver hoes, and the earth shakes the three rivers with iron arms."

The seas are in turmoil, and the continents are shaking. Most Respected Chairman Mao, it is you again, with your far-reaching vision, pointing out the future of China and the world, with the greatest courage and ambition of a great proletarian revolutionary, personally initiating and leading the unprecedented and world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the children of Jinggangshan, following your instructions to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," tightly hold high the red banner of the Jinggangshan revolutionary spirit and launch a comprehensive attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, such as Fang Zhiyuan, shattering their dreams of restoring capitalism and making the revolutionary old base area you personally opened up even redder and greener, with the revolutionary spirit shining forever.

Most Respected Chairman Mao, the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi is an epic of heart-pounding struggles. From the foot of Jinggangshan to the banks of the Gan River and the shores of Poyang Lake, revolutionary spirit surges like a rainbow everywhere, and heroic songs soar to the heavens everywhere. Every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi is a triumphant song of your brilliant thoughts, and every step forward is personally guided by you!

It was your big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" that gave us tremendous strength. Following you, riding the east wind of the "January Revolution," we swept away the stronghold of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the former Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee with an irresistible force, shattering their dream of restoring capitalism.

It was your invincible thoughts that swept away the remaining clouds in the sky, inspiring us to win the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the fierce class struggle, we kept your red book close to our hearts, looked up at the North Star, and sang "Looking up, I see the North Star, in my heart, I think of Mao Zedong" over and over again. Standing in front of your solemn and benevolent image, we made a heroic vow: "Cutting off my head is no big deal, as long as my ideals are true; defending Chairman Mao, I am willing to die!" We braved the waves and faced the storms to fight for your revolutionary line, repelling the enemy's repeated ferocious attacks!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was you again, at the critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, who sent us the heroic People's Liberation Army. "The red corner on the other side of the Gan River," the mountains and rivers smile to welcome our comrades, holding hands and shedding tears, with hearts connected in deep affection. Our comrades in the People's Liberation Army are like this, writing a magnificent "support-left and love-the-people" victory song on the Great Wall, raising another brilliant and dazzling red flag!

Respected Chairman Mao, the river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as your grace. You are always there for us, the children of Jinggangshan, supporting and caring for us. At the moment when we look up at the North Star and welcome victory, it is you who personally guide us to march forward, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi enter a new stage.

A red sun shines over the land, and golden light illuminates the rivers and mountains. On a morning in September, the vast rice fields surge with waves of joy, and the waters of Poyang Lake sing joyfully. Every heart is filled with a warm current of happiness. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, at the moment when we need to continue to advance after our victory, you traveled all over the country and personally came to Jiangxi. Your profound instructions are the greatest care, encouragement, education, and motivation for us, the children of Jinggangshan! Now, in Jiangxi, your revolutionary line has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, your thoughts have never been as deeply rooted as they are today, people's spirits have never been as vibrant as they are today, the dictatorship of the proletariat has never been as solid as it is today, and industrial and agricultural production have never been as vigorous as they are today.

Looking back at the battle journey, every victory of ours is the crystallization of your great thoughts. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, following you is happiness, following you is victory. Looking to the future, we are full of passion, holding high the red flag and breaking waves to move forward!

Respected Chairman Mao, we, the children of Jinggangshan, solemnly swear to you: We will definitely inherit, carry forward, and develop the revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, forever be loyal to you, never leave your side, and remain steadfast in our resolve.

Respected Chairman Mao, from Jinggangshan to Yan'an, from Yan'an to Beijing, we, the children of Jinggangshan, have deeply understood a great truth: "Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." With Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, achieving the ideological transformation of people is the core of all work. After we take power, among all the principles, the most fundamental one is to launch a larger-scale mass movement of studying and applying your great works, vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and foster a good learning style. We will definitely devote our greatest efforts to studying Mao Zedong Thought, our greatest loyalty to implementing Mao Zedong Thought, our greatest enthusiasm to propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and our greatest courage to defending Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely hold high your great red banner of thought, making the sky of Jiangxi the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, the land of Jiangxi the land of Mao Zedong Thought, and the people of Jiangxi the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The sky is red, the land is red, and the people are even redder. We will shoulder the historical mission bestowed by the times, letting Mao Zedong Thought shine over the world and illuminate the ages!

Respected Chairman Mao, your series of latest instructions are the most scientific, most profound, and most insightful summaries of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are the guiding beacons for us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We, the children of Jinggangshan, will definitely implement and carry out your latest instructions comprehensively, thoroughly, and without the slightest deviation!

Respected Chairman Mao, "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" is the great strategic plan and fundamental guideline you formulated. We, the children of Jinggangshan, will definitely use your thoughts as a weapon, like the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong, to carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, launch an attack on "self," strengthen proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly transform our worldview, and let your thoughts guide everything. We will definitely be thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

Respected Chairman Mao, we, the children of Jinggangshan, are closely following you to win the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely carry out the mass revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation movement more extensively and deeply, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all the poison spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, and eliminate the muddy water left by the old world. We will grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, work, and preparedness, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

Respected Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan and the People's Liberation Army are connected by flesh and blood, with deep affection. We will definitely hold high the banner of supporting the army, believe in and rely on the army, support and love the army, learn from and help the army, and vow to form an iron wall with the People's Liberation Army of China to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist mountains and rivers.

Respected Chairman Mao, you taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." We, the children of Jinggangshan, will definitely remember your wise teachings, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will definitely defend the new proletarian revolutionary power with our blood and lives, defend the proletarian headquarters led by you to the death, and let the socialist iron mountains and rivers last forever and be red for all ages!

Beijing has a red sun rising, and the five continents and four seas are illuminated. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the world has entered a new era with your thoughts as the great banner. The revolutionary road of Jinggangshan you opened up leads to the world, and your great truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is being grasped by revolutionary people all over the world. The cannon fire of Huangyangjie is shaking Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the flames of armed revolutionary struggles are burning across the five continents and four oceans. Respected Chairman Mao, standing on Jinggangshan and looking at the world, we vow to be international proletarian revolutionaries. Under your leadership, we will sweep away the evil, bind the giant, and eliminate all the harmful insects in the world. Let your brilliant banner of thought be planted all over the world and shine brightly everywhere!

With the deepest class feelings, we sincerely wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

    江西省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天，井冈扬臂举红旗，赣江奔腾来报喜。我们井冈山儿女，怀着无比的喜悦，无限的激情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告一个振奋人心的喜讯：在您光辉思想的哺育下，江西省革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生了。
    这是您的无产阶级革命路线的又一个辉煌战果！
    这是您的光辉思想在革命老根据地的又一个伟大胜利！
    这是您亲自缔造和领导的中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中创造的又一个丰功伟绩！
    毛主席啊，毛主席，广阔天宇，盛不下您给我们井冈山儿女的无限恩情；四海为墨，写不尽井冈山儿女对您的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。在这红旗如海人如潮、凯歌曲曲震山河的盛大节日里，我们心海卷起千层浪，纵情高歌《东方红》。最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊，井冈山儿女衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席，江西是您开创的第一个红色革命根据地，这里的一草一木都饱含着井冈山儿女对您的无限深情，这里的一山一水都记载着您带领我们走过的胜利征程。
    在中国工人阶级遭受三座大山残酷压榨的日子里，是您，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖，一次又一次来到安源，亲自在黑暗的煤窑点燃革命的烈火，敲响了旧世界的丧钟。从此，“不周山下红旗乱”，国际壮歌冲九天，中国工人运动沿着您指引的方向胜利前进！
    在中国革命的重大历史关头，是您，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖，以擎天的巨手，扭转了革命的航向，高举起马克思列宁主义的大旗，在井冈山上创建了第一个农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的革命根据地，缔造了中国工农红军这支举世无双的革命武装，为中国革命和世界革命开辟了具有伟大历史意义的光辉道路。
    在宏伟的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，是您，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖，号召我们“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。井冈山儿女牢记您的伟大教导，在政治战线和思想战线上夺取了一个又一个伟大胜利。在改天换地的斗争中，自力更生，奋发图强。旧貌换新颜，今朝更好看。红色土地上，“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。”
    四海翻腾，五洲震荡。最敬爱的毛主席啊，又是您，高瞻远瞩，指点中国和世界未来的前程，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的胆略和气魄，亲自发动和领导了史无前例、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。我们井冈山儿女，遵照您的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，紧紧跟着您，高举井冈山革命精神染红的造反大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人方志纯等党内一小撮走资派发动了全面的总攻击，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的迷梦，使您亲手开辟的革命老根据地旗更红，松更翠，革命精神永远放光辉。
    最敬爱的毛主席啊，江西无产阶级文化大革命的历史是一部惊心动魄的史诗。从井冈山麓到赣江两岸、波湖之滨，处处革命浩气贯长虹，处处英雄壮歌冲霄汉。江西无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利都是您光辉思想的凯歌，每前进一步都是您亲手指引！
    是您《炮打司令部》的大字报，给我们以巨大的力量。井冈山儿女跟着您，乘着“一月革命”东风，以排山倒海之势，摧毁了前江西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派这个复辟资本主义的顽固堡垒。
    是您战无不胜的思想，扫开了九天残云，鼓舞我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。在尖锐剧烈的阶级斗争中，我们把您的红色宝书紧贴心窝，仰首凝望北京城，一遍又一遍地高唱“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”。井冈山儿女站在您庄严而慈祥的像前，立下豪壮的誓言：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真；保卫毛主席，死了也甘心！”我们战恶浪，顶狂风，为捍卫您的革命路线而奋战，击退了阶级敌人一次又一次猖狂的进攻！
    敬爱的毛主席，又是您，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，给我们派来了英雄的人民解放军。“赣水那边红一角”，山笑水笑迎亲人，紧握双手热泪流，红心相连情谊深。亲人与我擎红旗，井冈儿女胆更壮，腰更硬！“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”亲人解放军就是这样谱写了一曲气壮山河的“支左爱民”凯歌，在伟大的长城上又升起了一面光辉夺目的红旗！
    敬爱的毛主席，河深海深，不如您老人家的恩情深。您时时刻刻都为我们井冈山儿女撑腰、操心。在我们仰首望北斗，迎接胜利的时刻，又是您亲自指引我们奋勇前进，使江西的无产阶级文化大革命，进入了崭新的阶段。
    一轮红日照大地，万道金光映山川。九月的一个早晨，万顷稻海涌起欢腾的浪花，波阳湖水纵情高唱，每一个人的心坎都激荡着幸福的暖流。毛主席啊，毛主席，在我们取得胜利需要继续前进的时刻，您走遍全国，亲临江西。您语重心长的教导，对我们井冈山儿女是最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的教育，最大的鞭策！现在，在江西，您的革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心，您的思想从来没有象今天这样深深扎根，人的精神面貌从来没有象今天这样焕发，无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固，工农业生产从来没有象今天这样热气腾腾。
    回顾战斗历程，我们每一个胜利都是您伟大思想哺育的结晶。毛主席啊，毛主席，跟着您就是幸福，跟着您就是胜利。展望未来，我们豪情满怀举红旗，乘风破浪向前进！
    敬爱的毛主席啊，我们井冈山儿女向您庄严宣誓：我们一定继承、发扬和光大井冈山革命传统，永远忠于您，寸步不离跟着您，海枯石烂志不移。
    敬爱的毛主席，从井冈山到延安，从延安到北京，我们井冈山儿女深深认识了一个伟大真理：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，这是一切工作的核心。我们掌权以后，千条万条，最根本的一条就是更大规模地掀起活学活用您的伟大著作的群众运动，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，建立革命的好学风。我们坚决把最大的努力用在学习毛泽东思想上，把最大的忠诚用在贯彻毛泽东思想上，把最大的热情用在宣传毛泽东思想上，把最大的勇敢用在捍卫毛泽东思想上。我们一定把您的思想伟大红旗举得高高的，让江西的天是毛泽东思想的天，地是毛泽东思想的地，人是毛泽东思想武装起来的人。天红地红人更红，江山万代红彤彤。我们要肩负起时代赋予我们的历史使命，让毛泽东思想普照全球，光耀万代！
    敬爱的毛主席，您的一系列最新指示，是对无产阶级文化大革命最科学、最透彻、最精辟的总结，是引导我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的指路明灯。我们井冈山儿女，一定坚决地不折不扣地全面地贯彻和落实您的最新指示，字字照办，句句照办，永远照办！
    敬爱的毛主席，“要斗私，批修”是您制定的伟大战略方针和根本纲领。我们井冈山儿女一定以您的思想为武器，象“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志那样，在灵魂深处闹革命，向“私”字展开进攻战，加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，彻底改造世界观，以您的思想统帅一切，誓做彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们井冈山儿女，正紧紧跟着您，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们一定更加广泛、更加深入地开展群众性的革命大批判和斗、批、改运动，坚决、彻底、干净地荡涤中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人所散布的一切流毒，荡涤旧世界遗留下来的污泥浊水。我们要狠抓革命，猛促生产，猛促工作，猛促战备，为从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋斗！
    敬爱的毛主席，井冈山儿女和人民解放军血肉相连，情谊深长。我们决心更高地举起拥军大旗，更加相信和依靠解放军，拥护和热爱解放军，学习和帮助解放军，誓与中国人民解放军结成保卫无产阶级专政、保卫社会主义江山的钢铁长城。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”我们井冈山儿女一定牢记您的英明教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。我们一定用鲜血和生命保卫新的无产阶级的革命政权，誓死捍卫以您为首的无产阶级司令部，让社会主义铁打江山，永存千秋，永红万代！
    北京升起红太阳，五洲四海都照亮。毛主席啊，毛主席，世界已进入了以您的思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。您开辟的井冈山革命道路通天下，您的“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理正为全世界革命人民所掌握。黄洋界的炮声正在亚、非、拉震荡，武装革命斗争的烈火燃遍五大洲、四大洋。敬爱的毛主席，我们站在井冈望全球，誓做国际无产阶级革命派。在您的率领下，我们征腐恶，缚鲲鹏，扫尽人间害人虫。让您光辉思想的伟大红旗插遍天下，红透全球！
    我们以无比深厚的阶级感情衷心祝愿您，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆！
