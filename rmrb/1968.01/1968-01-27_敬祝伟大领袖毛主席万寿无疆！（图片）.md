Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

"Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, making revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, in the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, received representatives from the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the General Staff Department, the General Logistics Department, the Air Force, and the Second Artillery. This is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country who are implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the greatest happiness for the military and civilian people across the country.

Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai posed for a group photo with representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the People's Liberation Army.

"Nothing is greater than the Party's favor, parents' love is not as dear as Chairman Mao's." Revolutionary soldiers, upon seeing Chairman Mao, were extremely excited and infinitely happy. They waved their red copies of the revolutionary treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and expressed their deep affection and loyalty to Chairman Mao in the most beautiful language, shouting enthusiastically for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

    敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，在全国无产阶级文化大革命越来越好的形势下，接见总参谋部、总后勤部、空军和第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，这对正在贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的全国亿万军民，是最大的关怀、最大的鼓舞、最大的鞭策，是全国军民最大的幸福。

    “天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。革命战士见到毛主席，无比激动，无限幸福。他们挥动着红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，把无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛主席的深厚感情，凝结成最美好的语言，长时间地热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
