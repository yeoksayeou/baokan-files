In recent days, people from all over Albania have held meetings and various activities to warmly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Albania (January 11).

In regions such as Fier and Saranda, laborers have held lectures and discussion meetings. They have discussed topics such as "The founding of the People's Republic of Albania is a major event in the history of the Albanian people" and "Socialism is an indestructible fortress on the Adriatic coast." They recalled the glorious revolutionary struggle that the Albanian people have undergone under the leadership of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great achievements of the revolutionary movement. The miners of the Selanica asphalt mine in the Fier region recounted the painful lives they endured under the oppression and exploitation of capitalists in the past, making the young miners understand the brave struggles of the older generation against the brutal exploitation of capitalists.

Workers from various places have also created outstanding achievements to welcome this glorious holiday. On the 11th, the drivers of the state-owned automobile transport company in Shkodra and other factories and enterprises braved the icy roads and rushed along the snowy mountain highways to quickly transport supplies to the mountainous areas of Pukë and Kukës.

In addition, people from various places have carried out various cultural and propaganda activities. The Shkodra region held a photo exhibition reflecting the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people and an art exhibition reflecting the Albanian people's victory over the earthquake disasters in the Dibër and Librazhd regions at the People's House of Cultural Creation. The 32 propaganda stations in the Durrës region also propagated the achievements of the Albanian socialist revolution and socialist construction to residents and cooperative members. Artists and students from various places held various performances.

On the 11th, various newspapers in Albania published editorials and articles to warmly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Republic.
