The soldiers of the 4562 Unit model the great call of Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people." They think what the people think, hurry where the people hurry, and help where the people need help. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have created countless exemplary deeds of loving the people.

The People's Liberation Army is truly the close friend of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

One sunny morning, a propaganda team from the 4562 Unit, carrying red flags and singing "The East Is Red," arrived at the Front Tea Village of Huairou Tea Village Commune.

As soon as the propaganda team entered the village, they divided into five small groups and went deep into the cadres and villagers to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions became the soul of the cadres and villagers, helping revolutionary cadres to stand up and work.

Under the lamp, a few soldiers and the secretary of the village party branch studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Old cadres have merits in the past, but they cannot rely on old merits. They must train and reform themselves well in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, establish new merits, and create new labor." The soldiers then sincerely explained how cadres should correctly handle mass movements and how to properly hold the power of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's teachings and the soldiers' sincere help touched the secretary's thoughts, making him realize his mistakes and put down some of his burdens. However, he still had some reservations about continuing to serve as a cadre.

The comrades of the propaganda team were not discouraged. They thought that Chairman Mao's teachings would surely make the secretary change his mind. If he couldn't understand it right away, they would allow him more time to think and do more ideological work. If they gave up on ideological and political work, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue would not be implemented. The soldiers then had a second and third heart-to-heart talk with the secretary, studied Chairman Mao's works together, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and labored together. The soldiers' extremely responsible spirit and extremely enthusiastic attitude deeply moved the secretary. He asked the soldiers, "You come to our village every morning before dawn and return late at night, running and staying up late, so tired. Why do you do this?" The soldiers firmly replied, "To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we are willing to run until our legs break and our eyes are sore!" Hearing these words full of love for the great leader Mao Zedong, a warm current instantly spread throughout the secretary's body. He was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes and said, "If I don't do it, I will let down Chairman Mao and you!" The secretary untied his ideological knots, became spirited, and worked with the villagers to promote revolution and production.

At the same time, the soldiers and the villagers repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, helping the villagers to correct their views on cadres. Some villagers even took the initiative to do ideological work for the cadres, encouraging them to bravely stand up and do revolution.

In this way, with the help of the propaganda team, most of the village cadres stood up. The villagers joyfully said, "The power of Mao Zedong Thought is greater than the sky and the earth; the class feelings of the People's Liberation Army for the poor and lower-middle peasants are deeper than rivers and seas. The People's Liberation Army is truly our close friend!"

Leaving a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that Never Leaves the Village

One morning, the sunrise was like brocade. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team sent by the 4562 Unit to Shanzhuang Village, as usual, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and sang "The East Is Red." As they sang, they suddenly heard a woman's voice. The soldiers looked to the side and saw an elderly peasant woman in her sixties! She waved her red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and gazed intently at Chairman Mao's portrait, singing passionately, "The East Is Red, the sun rises. China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." The soldiers happily surrounded the old woman. The old woman enthusiastically said, "The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is great, I also want to join. We also want to set up a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to propagate Mao Zedong Thought."

Setting up a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was the common wish of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Shanzhuang Village. Before the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the 4562 Unit came to the village, Shanzhuang Village had united, but it was not solid. The villagers called it "united in words but not in hearts, united in skin but not in flesh." After the propaganda team arrived, they immediately organized the two factions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting unity in their thoughts. Revolutionary masses unanimously said, "The People's Liberation Army sent us Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our time of difficulty. This is the greatest support and care for us. But what if the propaganda team leaves? Who will propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions for us?" The soldiers saw the villagers' feelings and decided to help the village set up a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. Under their initiative, the village quickly established two propaganda teams. However, these two propaganda teams belonged to different factions. The People's Liberation Army told them, "Those who propagate Mao Zedong Thought should act according to Mao Zedong Thought and become models in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao calls for achieving great unity, and you doing this way is not conducive to great unity. You should unite and set up a propaganda team together." With the help of the People's Liberation Army, one faction took the initiative to discuss with the other faction, finally uniting to set up a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. The villagers were satisfied and said, "This is a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that never leaves the village."

The People's Army Loves the People with All Their Hearts

"The comrades of our army, no matter where they go, must get along well with the people, care for the people, and help them solve their difficulties." The soldiers of the 4562 Unit always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and always think of the people. Wherever the people have difficulties, they appear there. The people gratefully say, "The People's Army loves the people with all their hearts."

On December 1, last year, a certain unit's 8th Company handed over a big red horse that had run away from another place to a certain company of the 4562 Unit. Soldier Zhang Wanhui took the initiative to take care of the horse, determined to raise it to be fat and strong and return it to its owner.

However, on the third morning, the red horse became frantic, neighed loudly, broke its reins, and ran up the mountain. Zhang Wanhui chased after it desperately. However, when he climbed up the mountain, the red horse had disappeared without a trace.

Should he chase or return? The horse is the people's property and must be found. Zhang Wanhui decided to chase! He kept chasing north. One mountain after another, high and steep, stretched endlessly. Zhang Wanhui was exhausted. However, Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people gave him endless strength. From morning to noon, from noon to evening, Zhang Wanhui did not eat a single meal or drink a drop of water, but his determination to catch the horse did not waver.

Another mountain blocked the way ahead. Zhang Wanhui tightened his belt and shouted to himself, "Climb up!" He used all his strength to climb to the middle of the mountain but could climb no further. He looked up and saw layer upon layer of white clouds, but no mountain top; he looked down and saw only steep cliffs. Zhang Wanhui felt dizzy and his heart beat wildly. He immediately took out his red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and loudly read, "Our comrades in times of difficulty should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's teachings instantly made him spirited, and he used his last bit of strength to continue climbing. Finally, on the third day, he and other comrades caught the red horse together.

A few days later, the owner of the horse, a villager from Miquan South Gate Commune, came to find it. They saw that the red horse was in good condition and were very grateful to the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army humbly said, "This is what we should do."

Heroic soldiers of the people, for the sake of protecting the people's interests, go where it is most dangerous. On December 28, last year, five houses in the Mill Village of the Mill Commune, Huairou County, caught fire. The fire was the order. The soldier Jiang Guorui, who was supporting agriculture in this team of the 4562 Unit, saw the flames and rushed to the fire scene. He saw the entire house become a sea of fire. Because the fire was too big, he could not get on the roof or enter the door. He immediately shouted, "Resolutely, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At this time, a villager said, "There is a steel mill inside the house!" Jiang Guorui heard this and immediately rushed into the fire with a squad leader and shouted, "Public property must be protected!" Inside the house, smoke and fire filled the air, and nothing could be seen. They used great strength to lift the steel mill out. After Jiang Guorui carried out the steel mill, he returned to the house and dragged out a basket. To quickly extinguish the big fire, he rushed into the house and poured water on the fire. The burning wood fell piece by piece, and the beams were about to collapse at any moment. The crowd outside anxiously shouted, "Comrade Jiang Guorui, come out! Come out!" But he firmly shouted inside the house, "Resolutely, fear no sacrifice!" Comrade Jiang Guorui fought against the big fire for more than half an hour and unfortunately fainted.

Under the doctor's emergency treatment, Comrade Jiang Guorui quickly regained consciousness. He said regretfully, "The fire was not completely extinguished, and I fainted. I did not complete the task well."

There are many soldiers like Zhang Wanhui and Jiang Guorui in the 4562 Unit. They have turned Mao Zedong Thought into their souls and truly done what Chairman Mao loves, they love; what Chairman Mao supports, they support; what Chairman Mao instructs, they follow; and where Chairman Mao waves his hand, they advance.

    毛泽东思想武装的人民子弟兵
    ——四五六二部队爱民的模范事迹散记
    爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲。千好万好，不如解放军好。
    四五六二部队广大指战员，模范地贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，想群众之所想，急群众之所急，帮群众之所需，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想创造了许许多多爱民的模范事迹。
      解放军真是贫下中农的贴心人
    一个阳光灿烂的早上，四五六二部队的一支毛泽东思想宣传队，高举红旗，在《大海航行靠舵手》的宏亮歌声中，来到了怀柔茶坞公社前茶坞大队。
    宣传队一进村，立即分成五个小组，深入到干部和社员中去，决心把毛主席最新指示化为干部和社员的灵魂，帮助革命干部站出来工作。
    电灯下，几个战士和大队党支部书记一起学习毛主席的教导：“老干部过去有功劳，但是不能靠吃老本，要很好地在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼改造自己，要立新功，立新劳。”接着，战士们满腔热情地讲述干部应如何正确对待群众运动，如何掌好无产阶级的大权。毛主席的教导，战士们的真诚帮助，打动了支部书记的思想，使他提高了认识，放下了一些思想包袱。可是，对于继续当干部，还有些顾虑。
    宣传队的同志们并不灰心。他们想，毛主席的教导是一定能使支部书记转过弯来的。他一时想不通，要允许他多想一个时候，要多作他的思想工作。如果放弃思想政治工作，毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示就不能落实。于是，战士们又第二次、第三次和支部书记谈心，并跟他一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起劳动。战士们对同志极端负责的精神和极端热忱的态度，使支部书记深受感动。他对战士们说：“你们每天天刚亮就到我们村来，半夜才回去，跑路，熬夜，这么辛苦，你们为的是什么呢？”战士们坚定地回答：“为了落实毛主席的最新指示，我们腿跑断，眼熬烂，也心甘情愿！”听了这些充满着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的话，一股暖流顿时传遍支部书记全身，他激动得热泪盈眶，说：“我再不干，对不起毛主席，也对不起你们！”支书解开了思想疙瘩，精神振作，就和社员一起抓革命促生产了。
    与此同时，战士们和社员群众一起，反复学习讨论了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，使群众端正了对干部的看法，有些群众还主动地去做干部的思想工作，让干部勇敢地站出来干革命。
    就这样，在宣传队的帮助下，大队干部大多数已站了出来。社员喜悦地说：“天大地大，不如毛泽东思想威力大；河深海深，不如解放军对贫下中农的阶级感情深。解放军真是我们贫下中农的贴心人！”
    留下永不离村的毛泽东思想宣传队
    一天清晨，朝霞似锦。四五六二部队派往山立庄大队的毛泽东思想宣传队，象往常一样站在毛主席像前高唱《东方红》。唱着，唱着，歌声中突然响起了妇女的声音。战士们不约而同地向旁边一看，啊，原来是一位六十多岁的贫农老大娘！她挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，目不转睛地望着毛主席像，激昂地唱着：“东方红，太阳升。中国出了个毛泽东。……”战士们高兴地将老大娘围住。老大娘热情地说：“毛泽东思想宣传队很好，我也要参加。我们还要办毛泽东思想宣传队，宣传毛泽东思想。”
    要办毛泽东思想宣传队，这是山立庄大队贫下中农社员的共同心愿。四五六二部队毛泽东思想宣传队进村以前，山立庄大队就联合了，但是还不巩固，群众称它为“口联心不联，皮联肉不联”。宣传队进村后，立即组织两派学习毛主席最新指示，促使两派在思想上联合起来。革命群众异口同声地说：“解放军在我们困难的时候送来了毛主席的最新指示，这是对我们的最大支援，最大爱护。可是，宣传队走了怎么办呢？谁来给我们宣传毛主席最新指示呢？”战士们看出了群众的心情，决定帮助大队建立一个毛泽东思想宣传队。在他们的倡议下，大队里马上成立了两个宣传队。但是，这两个宣传队各属一派。解放军就对他们说：“宣传毛泽东思想的人要按毛泽东思想办事，要成为执行毛主席最新指示的模范。毛主席号召实现革命大联合，你们这样作不利于大联合，应当联合起来办。”经过解放军的帮助，一派主动地找另一派商量，终于联合成立了一个毛泽东思想宣传队。群众满意地说：“这是永不离村的毛泽东思想宣传队”。
        人民子弟兵一心爱人民
      “我们的同志不论到什么地方，都要和群众的关系搞好，要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难。”四五六二部队指战员牢记毛主席的这一教导，处处为群众着想。那里的群众有困难，他们就出现在那里。群众感激地说：“人民子弟兵，一心爱人民。”
    去年十二月一日，解放军某部八连把从外地跑来的一匹大红马交给四五六二部队某连。战士张万辉主动承担了养马的任务，一心要把马儿养得膘肥体壮，交还失主。
    可是，第三天早上，红马烈性发作，长啸一声，挣断缰绳，奔驰上山。张万辉跟在后面拚命地追赶。但是，当他爬上山时，红马已无影无踪了。
    是追，还是回？马，是人民的财产，一定要找回来。张万辉毅然决定：追！他一直向北追去。一座座大山，又高又陡，连绵不断。张万辉累得精疲力竭。但是，毛主席的“完全”“彻底”为人民的教导，给了他无穷力量。从早上追到中午，从中午追到晚上，张万辉没吃一口饭，没喝一口水，但追马的决心不变。
    前面又一座大山挡住了去路。张万辉紧了紧腰带，自言自语地喊了声“爬上去！”他用尽全身力气爬到了山腰，再也爬不动了。他朝上望，只见一层层白云，不见山顶；再向下看，全是悬崖峭壁。张万辉头晕眼花，心猛跳了几下。他立刻拿出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗读：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导，顿时使他精神抖擞，他用尽最后一点气力，继续向上爬去。终于在第三天和其他同志一起将红马捉住了。
    不几天，马的主人——密云南关公社社员找来了。他们看到红马长得好好的，十分感激解放军。解放军同志都谦逊地说：“这是我们应该做的。”
    英雄的人民战士，为了保护人民的利益，那里最危险，就往那里闯。去年十二月二十八日，怀柔县碾子公社碾子大队的五间房子失火了。火光就是命令。在这个队“支农”的四五六二部队战士姜国富望见火苗，直奔火场，眼看整个房子成了一片火海。因为火势太大，上屋上不去，进门进不了。他立刻高喊：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这时，一个社员说：“屋子里有一副钢磨！”姜国富一听，马上和一个小队干部向火里扑去，并喊道：“公共财产一定要保护住！”屋子里烟火弥漫，什么也看不见，他们用了很大力气才把钢磨抬出来。姜国富同志抬出钢磨后，又返身进屋拖出簸箩。为了尽快扑灭大火，他奋不顾身地冲进屋去往火上泼水。正在燃烧着的木头一块一块地往下掉，屋梁随时都有塌下来的危险。外面的群众急得高喊：“姜国富同志，快出来！快出来！”他在屋里却坚定地喊：“下定决心，不怕牺牲”！姜国富同志坚持同大火战斗了半个多小时，不幸晕倒了。
    在医生急救下，姜国富同志很快苏醒过来。他惭愧地说：“火没有被完全扑灭，我就倒下了，没有很好完成任务。”
    象张万辉、姜国富这样一心为人民的战士，在四五六二部队里是很多的。他们把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，真正做到了“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
