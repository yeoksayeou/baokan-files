In the wake of U.S. President Johnson's New Year's announcement of "emergency measures" to save the dollar, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach hurried to Europe to seek "support." After a week of frenzied activity in the capitals of the seven Western European countries, he returned to Washington empty-handed on January 7. Katzenbach admitted that his European trip yielded little, and these countries were unwilling to assume "any obligations" to support Johnson's "emergency measures."

As a special envoy of the U.S. President, Katzenbach successively visited Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and France, holding intense talks with officials of these countries. He exhausted his eloquence, peddling Johnson's plan to reduce the U.S. international trade deficit, urgently demanding that these countries buy more American goods and share the burden of U.S. military expenses in Western Europe to help rescue the ailing dollar. However, the response from these "allies" of the U.S. in Western Europe was extremely cold, and the U.S. attempt to shift the economic crisis to these countries was met with fierce criticism.

In Paris, French Finance Minister Debré, during his talks with Katzenbach, openly criticized U.S. measures as self-serving and detrimental to other Western countries, causing them difficulties. Debré also warned Katzenbach: If the U.S. government attempts to force American companies operating in France to remit their profits back to the U.S., the French government would "re-examine the situation of American companies."

In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Fanfani, after talks with Katzenbach, expressed concern that U.S. "emergency measures" would harm Italy's economy.

In West Germany, where the U.S. had high hopes, Katzenbach also hit a wall. According to Western media reports, the U.S. originally planned to obtain a quarter to a third of the $3 billion in foreign exchange savings from West Germany. Katzenbach demanded that the West German government provide $2 billion in financial support to the U.S.; continue to compensate for U.S. military expenses in West Germany by purchasing large quantities of U.S. arms and U.S. national securities after June; increase imports of U.S. goods and reduce exports to the U.S., etc. Despite the immense pressure exerted by Katzenbach, the West German government, facing numerous financial and economic difficulties, rejected the U.S. demands. Katzenbach could only sadly admit at a press conference on January 8 that the West German government "made no specific commitments to provide assistance."

Britain, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands also gave Katzenbach a cold shoulder.

Despite the refusal of Western European countries to assume "obligations" to support U.S. "emergency measures," the U.S. is still trying every means to shift the U.S. financial and economic crisis onto other imperialist countries.

At a press conference upon his return on January 8, Katzenbach revealed that the U.S. government plans to impose additional import taxes on foreign goods and provide export subsidies for U.S. goods to strengthen the U.S. position in the trade war and earn more dollars. He admitted that these U.S. actions are primarily aimed at Western European countries, especially the member countries of the "Common Market."

The U.S.'s self-serving "emergency measures" are exacerbating the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and other imperialist countries, further splitting the imperialist camp. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk recently expressed his worries at a press conference, saying that some countries harmed by U.S. actions might take "certain steps in retaliation."

Katzenbach's European trip and the reactions it provoked indicate that the cutthroat competition in trade, finance, and currency in the capitalist world is becoming increasingly fierce, and the U.S. is finding itself in an increasingly precarious position in this melee.

    资本主义世界矛盾愈演愈烈　美国霸主地位越来越糟
    美国官员去西欧求援四处碰壁
    西欧国家不肯为约翰逊损人利己的挽救美元“紧急措施”承担义务
    据新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：在美帝头子约翰逊元旦宣布挽救美元的“紧急措施”后，匆匆赶往欧洲去争取“支持”的美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫，在西欧七国首都进行了一个星期的紧张活动，七日两手空空地回到华盛顿。卡曾巴赫承认，他这次西欧之行没有捞到什么油水，这些国家不肯为支持约翰逊的“紧急措施”承担“任何义务”。
    卡曾巴赫以美国总统特使的身份，先后访问了英国、西德、瑞士、比利时、荷兰、意大利和法国，同这些国家的官员进行了紧张的会谈。他费尽唇舌，兜售约翰逊减少美国国际收支赤字的计划，极力要求这些国家多买美国货，分担美国在西欧驻军的开支，以帮助挽救病入膏肓的美元。但是，美国这些西欧“盟国”的反应十分冷淡，美国企图向这些国家转嫁经济危机的作法遭到猛烈抨击。
    在巴黎，法国财政部长德勃雷在同卡曾巴赫会谈时，当面指责美国的措施是损人利己的，将给其他西方国家造成困难。德勃雷还向卡曾巴赫提出警告：如果美国政府企图强迫在法国开业的美国公司把它们的盈利转回美国，法国政府就要“重新研究美国公司的状况”。
    在罗马，意大利外长范范尼同卡曾巴赫会谈后表示，担心美国的“紧急措施”将会损害意大利的经济。
    在美国寄予很大希望的西德，卡曾巴赫也碰了壁。据西方报刊透露，美国原来打算从西德捞到它计划“节约”外汇三十亿美元总数的四分之一到三分之一。卡曾巴赫要求西德政府：给予美国二十亿马克的财政支持；在今年六月以后，继续以大量购买美国军火和美国国家证券的方式补偿美国在西德驻军的外汇开支；增加美国商品的进口，减少向美国的出口等。尽管卡曾巴赫施加了巨大压力，在财政经济方面面临着重重困难的西德政府拒绝了美国的要求。卡曾巴赫八日在记者招待会上也不得不黯然神伤地说，西德政府“没有作任何具体援助的表示”。
    英国、瑞士、比利时和荷兰等也同样给卡曾巴赫以冷遇。
    尽管西欧国家拒绝承担“义务”来支持美国的“紧急措施”，但是美国还是想尽一切办法，要把美国的财政经济危机转嫁到其他帝国主义国家身上去。
    卡曾巴赫八日在回国后举行的记者招待会上透露，美国政府打算对外国商品加征进口税，并对美国商品给予出口补助，以加强美国在贸易战中的地位，赚取更多的美元。他承认，美国这些做法，矛头首先是针对西欧国家，特别是“共同市场”成员国的。
    美国的损人利己的
  “紧急措施”正在加剧美帝国主义和其他帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，使帝国主义阵营进一步分崩离析。美国国务卿腊斯克最近在记者招待会上忧心忡忡地说，一些受美国作法损害的国家很可能采取“某些步骤以资报复”。
    卡曾巴赫这次西欧之行及其引起的反应表明：资本主义世界在贸易、金融、货币等方面的你死我活的倾轧正在越来越激烈，美国在这场混战中处境越来越不妙。
