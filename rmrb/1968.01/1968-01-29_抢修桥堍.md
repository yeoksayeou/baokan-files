A torrential downpour had washed away two large holes in the pier of a bridge. Curong Zhisheng, a militia cadre from the Eighth Platoon, decided to repair the bridge after work that evening. He thought to himself: This is a coastal defense outpost. The People's Liberation Army often passes through here with military trucks to defend our country. If the bridge is not repaired in time, military supplies cannot be transported to the coastal defense front in time. This is an urgent matter; who knows when a military truck might come through. Thinking of this, Curong immediately called over militia cadres Xu Zhen and Cao Jinbing, and shared his thoughts with them. The three of them immediately got to work.

The sky had completely darkened, but the three militia members, despite their fatigue from a day's work, continued to repair the bridge pier with all their might. It was not until around nine in the evening that they finished the repairs.

Soon after, a military truck loaded with supplies passed smoothly over the bridge. The militia members watched the military truck pass by, their hearts filled with an indescribable joy.

    抢修桥堍
    一场瓢泼大雨把一座桥的桥堍冲了两个大窟窿。八排基干民兵龚志兵决定晚上收工以后把桥修好。他心里想：这里是海防前哨，解放军为了保卫祖国，经常有军用卡车从这里经过，如果桥不及时修好，战备物资就不能及时运往海防前线，这是一件刻不容缓的事，说不定马上就有军用车开过来。龚志兵想到这里，立即找来了基干民兵徐真和曹锦兵，把自己的想法告诉了他们，三个人就立刻动起手来。
    天全黑了，三个民兵顾不得一天干活的疲劳，一个劲地在抢修桥堍，一直到晚上九点多钟才修好。
    一会儿，一辆满载军用物资的大卡车，顺利地驶过了桥。民兵们望着通过的军用卡车，心里有说不出来的高兴。
