In Beijing, revolutionary friends from various countries joyfully commemorate the fourth anniversary of Chairman Mao's talk supporting the Japanese people's struggle. Mao Zedong Thought guides the revolutionary struggles of peoples around the world towards greater victories. The people of the world will surely defeat American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

New China News Agency, January 27th: Four years ago, in his talk "Supporting the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Just Struggle," the great leader Chairman Mao issued a great call to arms: "The peoples of China and Japan must unite, the peoples of Asia must unite, all oppressed peoples and nations of the world must unite, all peace-loving countries must unite, and all countries and individuals subjected to aggression, control, interference, and bullying by American imperialism must unite to form a broad united front against American imperialism. We must frustrate the aggressive plans and war plans of American imperialism and defend world peace." Chairman Mao's great call to arms has inspired the anti-American struggles of the peoples of the world like a wildfire, spreading across the globe. Recently, revolutionary friends from various countries in Beijing revisited Chairman Mao's brilliant talk. They unanimously pointed out: Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's teachings on forming a broad united front against American imperialism have greatly armed and inspired the revolutionary peoples of the world. Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of the world will surely defeat American imperialism, surely defeat the number one accomplice of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and achieve thorough liberation.

Japanese friend Okabe Keiji, in a talk with our reporter, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's series of important statements and talks supporting the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. Okabe Keiji said, Chairman Mao's important statements and talks have scientifically summarized the situation in Japan, illuminating the path forward for the Japanese people. Chairman Mao said, "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." "The Japanese people will surely drive the American imperialists out of their country, and the Japanese people's aspirations for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely be realized." Chairman Mao's teachings are deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Japanese people, giving them great inspiration. The Japanese people's surging anti-American struggle is precisely advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Okabe Keiji said, Chairman Mao's pointing out that "American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation" has deeply penetrated the hearts of the Japanese people. Broad masses from various strata in Japan have gradually seen through the aggressive face of American imperialism, and more and more people have joined the ranks of the struggle against the American-Japanese reactionaries, forming an increasingly broad anti-American united front. When talking about the recent struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" intruding into Sasebo, he pointed out that this marks the further strengthening of the Japanese people's anti-American united front. The victory of this struggle has greatly boosted the revolutionary spirit of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people are advancing towards victory on the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Thai friend Nida said, under Chairman Mao's guidance, the anti-American united front of the peoples of various countries is expanding and strengthening. American imperialism is invading everywhere, and the noose it has put around its own neck is being pulled tighter and tighter by the people. The brave revolutionary peoples of various countries who resist American imperialism have deeply felt through their struggles that only by taking up armed struggle can they drive out American imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the running dogs of American imperialism. She said, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have formed a broad anti-American united front and launched armed struggle, using revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces. This is the only correct path for the Thai people to drive out American imperialism and overthrow the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique.

Tanzanian friend Aisha said, Chairman Mao's brilliant document "Supporting the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Just Struggle" is the support of the greatest leader of our times, the teacher of the revolutionary peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, for the just struggles of the peoples of various countries. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. American imperialism is evil incarnate and the common enemy of the peoples of the world. The oppressed peoples and nations of the world unite as one, and no force can stop them from burying American imperialism and its accomplices.

Friends from various countries all told the reporter that to achieve liberation and victory in the anti-American struggle, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the number one accomplice of American imperialism—Soviet modern revisionism.

Yemeni friend Ali pointed out that the Arab people, in order to achieve thorough liberation, must strangle American imperialism and the reactionaries and revisionists who follow in its wake. The Arab people have once again recognized from the 1967 Middle East events that the Kosygin-Brezhnev revisionist ruling clique, these so-called "reliable" "friends" of the Arab people, are daggers in the hearts of the Arab people, traitors who betray the cause of people's liberation and kowtow to American imperialism.

Ali said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "We say 'imperialism is very vicious,' meaning its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher's knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their doom." The Arab people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will wage a protracted people's war to oppose American imperialism and its tool Israel, and struggle for independence and national sovereignty, harboring no illusions about the Soviet revisionists.

Thai friend Nida said, in the struggle, the Thai people have seen through the traitorous face of Soviet modern revisionism more and more clearly. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique vigorously advocates the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition," and colludes with the American imperialist running dog Thanom-Praphat clique to try to extinguish the armed struggle of the Thai people. The Thai people have thus come to deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." The Thai people have recognized that the Soviet revisionists are traitors, not friends. The Thai people have come to realize that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. Only in this way can the struggle against imperialism achieve victory.

Okabe Keiji said, the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American struggle is also reflected in their exposure of the Miyamoto-led Japan Communist Party revisionist clique, recognizing their role as accomplices of American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese people have broken through the "legalism" and "parliamentary road" advocated by Soviet modern revisionism and the Miyamoto-led Japan Communist Party revisionist clique, and are resolutely fighting against the American-Japanese reactionaries. The treacherous acts of the Miyamoto revisionist clique have, from the opposite side, educated the Japanese revolutionary people that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Friends from various countries pointed out in their talks that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has further awakened the peoples of various countries, making the revolutionary peoples of various countries further recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism. Japanese friend Okabe Keiji said, the Japanese people love Mao Zedong Thought, regard Mao Zedong Thought as the sole guiding ideology of the Japanese people's revolutionary struggle, and as more and more Japanese revolutionary people study and master Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people will surely bloom more brilliantly. Thai friend Nida said, in the struggle, the Thai people have deeply felt that revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will produce boundless power. Therefore, the proclamation issued on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Thailand calls on the entire party and armed forces to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide work in all aspects. The Thai people firmly believe that as long as they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, persist in armed struggle, victory will surely belong to the Thai people.

A friend from Ecuador said, the revolutionary people of Ecuador are actively studying Mao Zedong Thought to prepare ideologically and organizationally for their struggle. The light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of struggle for the revolutionary peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought will surely guide the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, break through all obstacles, and achieve final victory.

    在京各国革命朋友欢呼毛主席支持日本人民斗争的谈话发表四周年
    毛泽东思想指引各国人民革命争取更大胜利
    全世界人民定能打败美帝苏修和各国反动派
    新华社二十七日讯　伟大领袖毛主席四年前在《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》中发出了伟大的战斗号召：“中日两国人民要联合起来，亚洲各国人民要联合起来，全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族要联合起来，一切爱好和平国家要联合起来，一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人士要联合起来，结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线，挫败美国帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划，保卫世界和平。”毛主席的伟大战斗号召，鼓舞着世界各国人民的反美斗争象燎原的烈火，燃遍全世界。在北京的各国革命朋友，最近重温毛主席的这一光辉谈话，他们一致指出：干革命靠毛泽东思想，毛主席关于结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线的教导，极大地武装和鼓舞了世界革命人民。在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，全世界人民一定能够打败美帝国主义，一定能够打败美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，获得彻底的解放。
    日本朋友冈部庆治向本社记者发表谈话时，热烈称颂毛主席发表的一系列支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的重要声明、谈话。冈部庆治说，毛主席的重要声明和谈话，对日本的状况作了科学的概括，照亮了日本人民前进的道路。毛主席说，“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”毛主席的教导深深印在日本人民的心里，给了日本人民极大的鼓舞。日本人民日益高涨的反美斗争，正是遵照毛主席所指出的方向前进的。
    冈部庆治说，毛主席指出的“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人”，在日本已深入人心。日本各阶层广大群众逐渐认清了美帝国主义的侵略面目，越来越多的人投入了反对美日反动派的斗争行列，形成了日益广泛的反美统一战线。他在谈到不久前日本人民反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”窜入佐世保的斗争时指出，这标志日本人民反美统一战线的进一步加强，这场斗争的胜利大长了日本人民的革命志气，日本人民正沿着毛主席指出的正确道路胜利前进。
    泰国朋友妮达说，在毛主席的指引下，各国人民的反美统一战线日益扩大和加强。美帝国主义到处侵略，套在它自己脖子上的绞索被人民拉得越来越紧。勇敢反对美帝国主义的各国革命人民通过自己的斗争深深体会到，只有采取武装斗争才能赶走美帝国主义，推翻美帝国主义走狗的反动统治。她说，泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，遵照毛主席的教导，组成广泛的反美统一战线，开展武装斗争，用革命的武装反对反革命的武装，这是泰国人民赶走美帝国主义和推翻他侬卖国集团的唯一正确道路。
    坦桑尼亚朋友阿霞说，毛主席发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》这一光辉文件，是当代最伟大的领袖、世界革命人民的导师毛主席，对世界各国人民正义斗争的支持。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。美帝国主义无恶不作，是全世界人民的公敌。全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族团结一致，就没有任何力量能够阻挡他们埋葬美帝国主义及其同伙。
    各国朋友都向记者谈到，各国人民要获得解放，要取得反美斗争的胜利，必须同时坚决反对美帝国主义的头号帮凶——苏联现代修正主义。
    也门朋友阿里指出，阿拉伯人民为了争取彻底的解放，应该绞死美帝国主义以及跟在美帝国主义后面转的反动派和修正主义。阿拉伯人民从一九六七年的中东事件中再一次认识到，柯西金、勃列日涅夫修正主义统治集团这些所谓阿拉伯人民可以“信赖”的“朋友”，是插在阿拉伯人民心脏中的匕首，是出卖人民解放事业、投靠美帝国主义的叛徒。
    阿里说，毛主席教导我们：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”阿拉伯人民用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，将进行持久的人民战争，为反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列，争取独立和国家主权而斗争，绝不对苏修抱任何幻想。
    泰国朋友妮达说，泰国人民在斗争中越来越看清了苏联现代修正主义的叛徒面目。苏修领导集团竭力鼓吹“议会道路”“和平过渡”，并且同美帝国主义走狗他侬—巴博集团勾结起来，企图扑灭泰国人民的武装斗争。泰国人民从而越来越深刻地理解了毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”泰国人民认清苏修是叛徒，不是朋友。泰国人民体会到，反对帝国主义必须反对修正主义，只有这样，反对帝国主义的斗争才能取得胜利。
    冈部庆治说，日本人民反美斗争的胜利，还表现在他们揭露了以宫本为首的日共修正主义集团，认清了它们充当美帝和日本反动派的帮凶面目。日本人民突破了苏联现代修正主义、日共宫本修正主义集团所鼓吹的“合法主义”、“议会道路”，毅然地和美日反动派进行坚决的斗争。宫本修正主义集团的背叛行径，从反面教育了日本革命人民，反帝必须反修。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。各国革命朋友在谈话中指出，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，进一步激醒了世界各国人民，使各国革命人民进一步认识到，毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大思想武器。日本朋友冈部庆治说，日本人民热爱毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想看做日本人民革命斗争的唯一指导思想，随着越来越多的日本革命人民学习和掌握毛泽东思想，日本人民的革命斗争必将开出更加灿烂的花朵。泰国朋友妮达说，泰国人民在斗争中深深体会到，革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就会产生无穷无尽的力量。因此，泰国共产党成立二十五周年发表的文告中，号召全党和武装队伍更加高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想指导各方面的工作。泰国人民坚信，只要活学活用毛主席著作，坚持武装斗争，胜利一定属于泰国人民。
    一位厄瓜多尔朋友说，厄瓜多尔革命人民正在积极学习毛泽东思想，为他们开展的斗争作思想和组织准备。毛泽东思想的光芒照亮了世界革命人民斗争的道路，毛泽东思想必将指引各国人民的革命斗争，冲破各种障碍，取得最后胜利。
