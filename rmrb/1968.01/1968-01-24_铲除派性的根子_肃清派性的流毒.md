	Eradicate the Roots of Factionalism and Eliminate the Poison of Factionalism
	Tianjin Valve Factory, Liu Yonghai, Liu Shikuang

	“Whatever is reactionary, you don’t beat it, it won’t fall.”
	Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a reactionary thing. It splits the revolutionary ranks, undermines the fighting spirit of the revolutionary masses, interferes with the direction of the struggle, disrupts production, shields bad elements, harms the revolution, and is a vicious enemy of the Cultural Revolution. In the face of a great enemy, it must be thoroughly defeated, and its poison eliminated, in order to follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Our factory has two major factions of mass organizations that have often engaged in factionalism. We two were originally leaders of the two factions. Reflecting on the more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, why did we always fight “internal wars”? The main reason is that we had the “self” in our minds, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. As a result, right and wrong were not clear, friends and enemies were not distinguished, and we did not prioritize the overall situation but rather followed our own judgment. Those who agreed with my views seemed more and more friendly; those who disagreed with my views seemed more and more hateful. Often, we would seize on the shortcomings of the other side and exaggerate them, attacking one point without considering the rest. In this situation, the antagonistic feelings between our two factions grew stronger, and we fought several “internal wars,” affecting the revolution and delaying production.

	Chairman Mao said: “Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.” Although our two factions both responded to Chairman Mao’s great call and were ready to unite, we still argued endlessly over the issue of seats in the leadership. For the sake of adding a “big” character to the banner of the “Joint Committee,” we almost started another “internal war.” Later, we two participated in a study class on Mao Zedong Thought organized by the PLA’s leftist support troops, where we seriously studied Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, we realized: the working class is like bitter gourds on the same vine, and our common enemy is the Chinese Khrushchev. To fight for small-group power, seats, and banners is to engage in factionalism and splitism, with factionalism at work. Our two factions, through consultation, resolved the issues of “seats” and banners, and achieved revolutionary great unity.

	Soon, when we were working on the revolutionary tripartite alliance, our two factions argued again over the issue of liberating the cadres. You want to liberate, I want to fight. Later, with the help of the PLA, the two factions studied Chairman Mao’s latest instructions on the cadre issue. We realized that the cadres could not be liberated mainly because of our factionalism. Because of factionalism, we could not correctly handle the cadres according to Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. After we jumped out of the factionalism pit, we felt that most cadres were good or relatively good. Now that they have recognized their mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, we should welcome them and let them come out to revolutionize. In this way, the revolutionary tripartite alliance was quickly formed, and the revolutionary committee of the factory was established.

	Over the past more than a year of practice, we deeply felt that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is indeed like a poisonous snake. It can strangle people, bite people, and poison people. Once infected with factionalism, it is like taking opium, making people deluded and wandering further and further down the wrong path, falling into an incurable state. Factionalism is like a corrosive agent. If you touch it, it will gradually corrode you. Factionalism comes from selfishness and in turn fosters selfishness.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Errors and setbacks have taught us and made us somewhat wiser, so we can do things better.”

	Over the past more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, especially after seriously studying the New Year’s editorial and the articles “On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism” and “Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat, Unite!”, we understand that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a vicious enemy of the Cultural Revolution; especially today, as the Cultural Revolution deepens, factionalism is an important weapon for the bourgeoisie to fiercely oppose the proletariat. It is reactionary and must be resolutely defeated. To defeat factionalism, we must take “fight selfishness and criticize revisionism” as the guiding principle, carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, thoroughly break down selfishness, and firmly establish public-mindedness. We must fundamentally reform our worldview and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds. In this way, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat can truly unite, follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, consolidate the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary tripartite alliance, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    铲除派性的根子　肃清派性的流毒

      “凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是反动的东西。它分裂革命队伍，瓦解革命群众的斗志，干扰了斗争大方向，破坏生产，包庇坏人，危害革命，是文化大革命的凶恶敌人。大敌当前，必须彻底打倒，肃清其流毒，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    我们厂两大派群众组织，过去经常闹派性。我们两人原来是两派群众组织的头头，回想在一年多的文化大革命中，为什么老打“内战”呢？主要是由于头脑里有“私”字，有资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。结果，是非不明，敌我不分，不以大局为重，而是以我为准。同意我的观点的人，越看越亲；不同意我的观点的人，越看越恨。经常抓住对方的一些缺点，就无限上纲，攻其一点，不及其余。在这种情况下，我们两派群众组织对立情绪越来越大，连续打了几次“内战”，影响革命，耽误生产。
    毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们两派虽然都响应了毛主席的伟大号召，准备联合起来，但是，在领导班子的席位问题上，两派争论不休。为了在“联合委员会”的旗子上增加一个“大”字，也几乎打起“内战”。后来，我们两人参加了解放军支左部队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示。通过忆苦思甜、斗私批修，我们认识到：工人阶级是一条藤上的苦瓜，共同的敌人是中国赫鲁晓夫。为小团体争权，争席位，争旗号，就是搞山头主义，搞分裂主义，派性在作怪。我们两派通过协商，解决了“席位”和旗号的问题，实现了革命的大联合。
    不久，在搞革命三结合时，在解放领导干部的问题上，我们两派又吵起来了。你要立，我就打。后来，在解放军的帮助下，两派学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。我们认识到，干部解放不了，主要是我们的派性在作怪。因为有了派性，就不能按照毛主席的最新指示，正确对待干部。我们从派性的泥坑里跳出来以后，感到大多数干部是好的和比较好的，现在他们认识了错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就应该欢迎他们，让他们站出来革命。这样，很快促成了革命的三结合，成立了厂的革命委员会。
    一年多来的实践，我们深深体会到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，确实象条毒蛇，它能缠死人，咬死人，毒死人。中了派性的毒，就象吸鸦片那样，使人执迷不悟，在歪道上越走越远，陷入不可救药的地步。派性象腐蚀剂，要是一沾上，它就会一点一点地把你腐蚀掉。派性来源于私字，又助长了私字。
    毛主席教导我们：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”
    一年多来的文化大革命，特别是认真学习了元旦社论和《论派性的反动性》、《无产阶级革命派，联合起来！》这几篇重要文章，我们懂得，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是文化大革命的凶恶敌人；特别是在文化大革命深入发展的今天，派性是资产阶级疯狂反对无产阶级的重要武器，它就是反动，一定要坚决打倒。要打倒派性，就要以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处闹革命，大破私字，大立公字，彻底改造自己的世界观，让毛泽东思想在头脑中扎根。这样，无产阶级革命派才能真正联合起来，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，才能巩固革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
