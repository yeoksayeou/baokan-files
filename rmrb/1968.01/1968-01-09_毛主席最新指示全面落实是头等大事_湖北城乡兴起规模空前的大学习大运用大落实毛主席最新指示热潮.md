A unprecedented wave of extensive study, application, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as well as extensive propaganda, discussion, and implementation of the New Year's Day editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *PLA Daily*, is rapidly sweeping across Hubei Province. The broad masses of workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have resolved to make the thorough study and application of Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions the fundamental task in the new year, ensuring that every instruction from Chairman Mao is fully implemented, and vowing to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, from Wuhan City to small and medium-sized towns, from the PLA's leading organs to their garrisons, from the banks of the Yangtze River and the Jianghan Plain to the mountainous areas of western Hubei, everywhere is a scene of boiling enthusiasm. Revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers across the province are holding study sessions, symposiums, experience-sharing meetings, and oath-taking rallies to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Countless Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are active in factories, rural areas, barracks, and stations and docks, enthusiastically propagating the five battle tasks for 1968 and rapidly spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The leading organs of the Wuhan Military Region and various revolutionary mass organizations in Hubei have made decisions overnight to seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's Day editorial, making the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions the overriding central task.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in urban and rural areas of Hubei, who have already achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, making the summary and inspection of the situation over the past more than a year of implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution a major step in the new year to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They unanimously declare: to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; to heighten revolutionary vigilance and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies who dare to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotage socialist construction, and disrupt social order; to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "selfish" element, resolutely resist and oppose all actions and words that go against Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. On the basis of summarizing and inspecting work and unifying ideological understanding, many factories, people's communes, schools, offices, streets, and revolutionary mass organizations have mobilized the masses to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, revised and formulated battle plans to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution this year.

Establishing and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the primary measure taken by various places in Hubei to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of the great leader Chairman Mao, conveyed Chairman Mao's great call to establish study classes at the capital's National Day celebration rally last year, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in urban and rural areas of Hubei immediately launched a wave of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the short span of three months since last October, tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established across the province, with over a million people participating in the study classes.

Promoting and vigorously advocating the revolutionary study style of Marxism-Leninism championed by Chairman Mao is a prominent feature of the various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places in Hubei in the new year. So far, nearly 90% of the factories and enterprises in Wuhan City have achieved revolutionary great unity, with the vast majority establishing revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups. Primary and secondary schools have universally resumed classes and carried out the revolution. Most prefectures and counties in the province have basically achieved revolutionary great unity, with a batch of prefectures, counties, and industrial enterprises establishing revolutionary committees or preparatory groups. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, which had been in negotiations for over four months and held 29 sessions without achieving revolutionary great unity, immediately established a study class after the publication of the New Year's Day editorial, with the leaders of five revolutionary mass organizations studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together under the strong support of the PLA's garrison support team, finally achieving revolutionary great unity across the factory.

Chairman Mao says: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Hubei Province, who have established immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have resolved in the new year to more resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's battle call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement," establishing new merits in helping the revolutionary leftists comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They will think about implementing the latest instructions, speak about implementing the latest instructions, work on implementing the latest instructions, exert effort on implementing the latest instructions, and stride forward on implementing the latest instructions, resolutely doing a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席最新指示全面落实是头等大事
    湖北城乡兴起规模空前的大学习大运用大落实毛主席最新指示热潮
    据新华社武汉八日电　一个规模空前的大学习、大运用、大落实毛主席最新指示，大宣传、大讨论、大贯彻《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论的热潮，正在湖北省迅速兴起。广大工农群众、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，决心在新的一年里，把学好用好毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示作为根本的根本，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    连日来，从武汉市到中小城镇，从人民解放军领导机关到驻地营房，从长江两岸、江汉平原到鄂西北山区，到处一片沸腾景象。各地广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员纷纷举行学习会、座谈会、讲用会、誓师大会，落实毛主席的最新指示。无数的毛泽东思想宣传队活跃在工厂、农村、营房和车站、码头，热情宣传一九六八年的五项战斗任务，迅速传播毛主席的最新指示。武汉部队各级领导机关和湖北的各革命群众组织，连夜作出了认真学好贯彻好毛主席最新指示和元旦社论的决定，把全面落实毛主席的最新指示作为压倒一切的中心任务。
    毛主席教导我们：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”已经赢得无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的湖北城乡广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把总结检查一年多来贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示的情况，作为在新的一年里，进一步全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重大步骤。他们一致表示：要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；要把革命警惕性提得高高的，坚决打击胆敢破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设、扰乱社会治安的一小撮阶级敌人；要把“私”字斗得臭臭的，坚决抵制和反对一切违背毛泽东思想的言行，保证毛主席的最新指示全面落实。在总结检查工作、统一思想认识的基础上，许多工厂、人民公社、学校、机关、街道和革命群众组织，都发动群众，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，修改和制订了夺取今年无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗规划。
    大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，是湖北各地全面落实毛主席最新指示所采取的最主要的办法。伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席去年在首都庆祝国庆节的大会上传达了毛主席要开办学习班的伟大号召后，湖北城乡广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，立即掀起了一个大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。从去年十月以来的短短三个月内，全省城乡办起了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，先后参加学习班学习的人数达百万以上。
    大兴特兴毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，是湖北各地在新的一年里开始举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班的一个最鲜明的特点。到目前止，武汉市有将近百分之九十的工厂企业实现了革命大联合，其中绝大部分成立了革命委员会或革筹小组。大中小学已普遍复课闹革命。全省大部分专区和县也基本上实现了革命大联合，其中一批专区、县和厂矿企业，成立了革命委员会或筹备小组。历时四个多月商谈了二十九次，仍没有实现革命大联合的武汉重型机床厂，在元旦社论发表后，五个革命群众组织的负责人，在人民解放军驻厂支左部队的大力支持下，立即办了一个学习班，大家坐在一起认真学习毛主席的最新指示，终于实现了全厂革命的大联合。
    毛主席说：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”。遵照毛主席的教导，在湖北省无产阶级文化大革命中建立了不朽功勋的中国人民解放军驻武汉部队广大指战员，在新的一年中，决心更加坚决地响应林彪副主席发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召，把新功立在帮助革命左派全面落实毛主席最新指示上，做到心往落实最新指示上想，话往落实最新指示上说，工作往落实最新指示上做，劲往落实最新指示上使，步伐往落实最新指示上迈，坚决把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
