In the face of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide and the clarion call of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to win a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the news of the establishment of revolutionary committees in many prefectures, cities, and counties of Henan Province has been coming in frequently. The revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organs of the proletariat, once born, immediately received warm welcome from the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, becoming the core of uniting the broad revolutionary masses to carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions and advancing vigorously along the course charted by our great leader Chairman Mao. They have powerfully promoted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various places.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches us:

"In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be carried out, and a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat must be established. The name of this power organ is good to be called the revolutionary committee."

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Henan Province, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in their regions and units, further developed revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and actively created conditions for the establishment of revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs.

When our great leader Chairman Mao inspected North China, Central South, and East China, he personally visited Henan, giving the greatest encouragement, care, support, and education to the five thousand million revolutionary people of Henan. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are full of vigor and high morale, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely resisting and opposing the trends from the right and the ultra-left, and laying the ideological foundation for the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels. On October 30, 1967, Lankao County, where Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, fought, announced the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the first in the province. Subsequently, many prefectures, cities, and counties established revolutionary committees. By January 17 of this year, Henan Province had established revolutionary committees in five prefectures, New Xiang, Zhuo Mao Store, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and four cities, Kaifeng, New Xiang, Hebi, Jiaozuo, as well as more than forty counties; some prefectures and counties and cities have established revolutionary committee preparatory groups.

The establishment of a large number of revolutionary committees in various places in Henan Province has declared the complete failure of the capitalist restoration conspiracy of China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places in Henan; at the same time, it has laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee.

The revolutionary committees born in the storm of class struggle put the learning, execution, propaganda, and defense of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything, and regard the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the most sacred duty. After the establishment of many revolutionary committees, the first plenary meeting, the first decision made, and the first major task undertaken were all to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In New Xiang Prefecture, 14 out of 16 counties and cities have established revolutionary committees. These places have held more than 5,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 1.5 million people participating in the study, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the local area. After the establishment of many county revolutionary committees, they vigorously carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, sending Chairman Mao's portrait, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and the "Three Articles" to the hands of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Revolutionary masses said excitedly: "The revolutionary committee is good, it has brought us the revolutionary treasure book."

Many new and old revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary committees, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "you must put politics in command, go to the masses, be among the masses, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better," "you must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be a small student of the masses," closely contact the masses, take the lead in executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, constantly arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and grasp the revolutionization of the leading members of the revolutionary committee. They have established a revolutionary, fighting, and close-to-the-masses work style that is full of vigor and decisiveness.

The revolutionary committees in various places have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," leading the revolutionary masses to further carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in their units, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Henan, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination; vigorously promote industrial, agricultural production and various works, making these regions present a thriving new look.

    全面落实伟大领袖毛主席最新指示就是胜利
    河南省许多地市县成立革命委员会
    全省已有五个地区、四个市、四十多个县相继成立革命委员会，为建立省革命委员会打下了坚实的基础，成为团结广大革命群众执行毛主席最新指示的核心。
    据新华社郑州二十日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，亿万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号声中，河南省许多地、市、县成立革命委员会的喜讯频频传来。革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构一经诞生，立即受到广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的热烈欢迎，成为团结广大革命群众贯彻执行毛主席最新指示，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进的核心，有力地推动了各地的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：
  “在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”河南省的广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，深入开展革命大批判和本地区、本单位的斗批改，进一步发展革命大联合和革命三结合，积极为建立革命三结合临时权力机构创造条件。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时，亲临河南，给了河南五千万革命人民最大鼓舞，最大关怀，最大支持，最大教育。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大力落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决抵制和反对来自右的方面或来自极“左”方面的思潮，为建立各级革命委员会奠定了思想基础。一九六七年十月三十日，毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志生前战斗过的兰考县，广大贫下中农和革命干部紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在全省第一个宣告成立革命委员会。随后，许多地、市、县革命委员会，也相继建立起来。到今年一月十七日止，河南全省已经有新乡、驻马店、开封、洛阳、商丘五个地区和开封、新乡、鹤壁、焦作等市以及四十多个县，相继建立了革命委员会；还有一些地区和县、市，建立了革命委员会筹备小组。
    河南省各地大批革命委员会的相继成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南各地代理人复辟资本主义阴谋的彻底破产；同时，也为建立省革命委员会打下了坚实的基础。
    在阶级斗争暴风雨中诞生的革命委员会，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，把条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，当作最崇高的职责。许多革命委员会成立后召开的第一次全体会议，作出的第一个决定，抓的第一件大事，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动。新乡地区十六个县、市，已有十四个县、市成立了革命委员会。这些地方先后举办了五千多个毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的有一百五十多万人，进一步巩固和发展了当地的革命大联合和革命三结合。许多县革命委员会成立后，大抓活学活用毛主席著作群众运动，把毛主席像、《毛主席语录》、“老三篇”等送到广大贫下中农手中。革命群众满怀激情地说：“革命委员会就是好，给俺送来了革命宝书。”
    许多革命委员会内的新老革命干部，遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”，“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，密切联系群众，带头执行毛主席的最新指示，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑，抓紧革命委员会领导成员本身的革命化，大树朝气蓬勃、雷厉风行、密切联系群众的革命化、战斗化的工作作风。
    各地革命委员会坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，领导革命群众进一步开展革命大批判和本单位斗批改，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合；大力推动工业、农业生产和各项工作，使这些地区出现了蒸蒸日上的新面貌。
