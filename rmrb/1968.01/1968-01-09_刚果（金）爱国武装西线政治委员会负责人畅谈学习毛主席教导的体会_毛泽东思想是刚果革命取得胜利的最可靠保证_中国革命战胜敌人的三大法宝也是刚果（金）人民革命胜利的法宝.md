The guerrilla fighters battling in the heart of Africa—Congo (Kin)—hold boundless respect and love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. They hold boundless admiration and faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of every revolutionary fighter in Congo (Kin)." "Mao Zedong Thought is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Congo (Kin) revolution." They have established study groups for Chairman Mao's works, eagerly studying them and linking them to their revolutionary struggles, applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Recently, two leaders of the Political Commission of the Western Front of the Patriotic Armed Forces of Congo (Kin) spoke about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the three magic weapons that led China's revolution to victory. They said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "A party that is disciplined, armed with Marxism-Leninism, practices self-criticism, and is linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party. These three are our main weapons for defeating the enemy." They pointed out that these three magic weapons are the three magic weapons that the Communist Party of China used to defeat the enemy in the Chinese revolution, and they are also the three indispensable magic weapons for the Congolese people to achieve revolutionary victory.

They said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the brightest red sun in the hearts of every revolutionary fighter in Congo (Kin). Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse of our Congo revolution, the sole reliable guarantee for our revolutionary victory." They emphasized: "In the struggle, we have deeply felt that only by following Chairman Mao closely and firmly grasping and relying on Mao Zedong Thought can we lead the revolution to victory. Not for a moment can we part with Mao Zedong Thought, otherwise, the revolution will suffer setbacks and failure."

They said: "In this era, we celebrate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought a million times, this is the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people in the world and for the Congolese revolutionaries. Mao Zedong Thought has saved all humanity. If it were not for the unprecedented, great and glorious Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, we would not be talking about world revolution." They excitedly said: "The Lenin of today—our great teacher Chairman Mao—has opened up the path of revolution for the revolutionary people of the world, greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the world's revolutionary people, giving new life to the Congolese revolutionaries. Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman, making world revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

They said: Mao Zedong Thought has shown the way for the Congo (Kin) revolution. Although there will still be various difficulties and twists and turns on the revolutionary road, the Congolese people are full of confidence in revolutionary victory. Because Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Victory will surely belong to the revolutionary people of Congo (Kin).

The two leaders of the Political Commission of the Western Front of the Patriotic Armed Forces of Congo (Kin) pointed out: Persisting in a long-term armed struggle is the only way for the Congolese people to achieve national independence and liberation. This lesson is one that the Congolese people and countless revolutionary martyrs have paid for with their blood. They said: "After Lumumba declared Congo's independence on June 30, 1960, because he did not grasp the gun, under the armed invasion of the Belgian colonial authorities and the 'United Nations forces' manipulated by U.S. imperialism, the legal government of Congo was overthrown, and Lumumba himself was murdered. Today, the imperialists and their lackeys all have knives in their hands to kill people, and we must also take up knives to seize power through armed struggle, there is no other way."

They also angrily denounced the betrayal of the Congolese people's armed revolutionary struggle by Soviet modern revisionists.

They said: The Soviet modern revisionists have given the Congolese people a lesson from the opposite side. The Soviet revisionists wanted Kizan to abandon armed struggle and take the parliamentary road to become an official in the puppet government controlled by imperialism, resulting in him becoming a victim of the Soviet revisionists' "peaceful coexistence" policy. Over the years, the Soviet modern revisionists have used every means to sabotage the armed struggle of the Congolese people, and there are countless examples of their splitting the Congolese national independence movement. Recently, the Soviet modern revisionists again absurdly said that the Congolese people should "reconcile" with Mobutu, which is a pipe dream.

When talking about how to better carry out the armed struggle, they expressed that they will act according to Chairman Mao's teaching: "Revolutionary war is the people's war, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." They said: "To carry out armed struggle, we must rely on the masses, especially mobilizing, organizing, and arming the peasants is even more important to us, because peasants account for more than 90% of our country's population, the working class is the leading class, but the revolution cannot start from the main cities occupied by the enemy, but can only first establish revolutionary bases in the vast rural areas where the enemy's strength is weak, and then seize the cities." They continued: The vast rural areas and boundless forests of Congo (Kin) are a great place for guerrilla warfare. They said: The great path of relying on the masses, establishing rural revolutionary bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities, opened up by the great leader Chairman Mao, is the path we must follow. They also expressed: People's war is the most effective magic weapon to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that can be completely defeated. The heroic people of Vietnam's anti-American national salvation struggle have proven this, setting an example for the Congolese people. The Congolese people are determined to wage a people's war, drive U.S. imperialism out of Congo (Kin), and achieve national independence and liberation.

They emphasized: To carry out armed struggle, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." They expressed that the Congolese people must carry out armed struggle to the end.

Finally, they read together in a loud voice three times: "Resolutely, fearlessly, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They excitedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life!"

    刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会负责人畅谈学习毛主席教导的体会
    毛泽东思想是刚果革命取得胜利的最可靠保证
    中国革命战胜敌人的三大法宝也是刚果（金）人民革命胜利的法宝
    据新华社讯　战斗在非洲心脏——刚果（金）的游击战士们对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限崇敬，无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限崇拜，无限信仰。他们说：“毛主席是我们刚果（金）每个革命战士心中最红最红的红太阳。”“毛泽东思想是我们刚果（金）革命取得胜利的最可靠的保证。”他们成立了学习毛主席著作小组，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，并联系他们革命斗争的实际，运用毛泽东思想。
    刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会两位负责人最近发表谈话，谈到了他们学习毛主席关于领导中国革命取得胜利的三大法宝的心得体会。他们说：毛主席教导我们：“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。”他们指出，这三个法宝是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三大法宝，也是刚果（金）人民要取得革命胜利的必不可少的三大法宝。
    他们说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是我们刚果（金）每个革命战士心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是我们刚果革命的灯塔，是我们取得革命胜利的唯一可靠的保证。”他们强调说：“在斗争中，我们切身体会到只有紧跟毛主席，紧紧掌握和依靠毛泽东思想，才能引导革命走向胜利。一时一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想，否则革命就会遭到挫折和失败。”
    他们说：“在当代，我们为有战无不胜的毛泽东思想而千百万次欢呼，这是全世界所有革命人民和刚果（金）革命者最大的幸福。毛泽东思想拯救了全人类。当今如果没有由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的、丰功伟绩的中国无产阶级文化大革命，就谈不到世界革命。”他们激动地说：“当代的列宁——我们伟大的导师毛主席，为世界革命人民开辟了革命的航程，大大鼓舞了世界革命人民的革命斗志，使我们刚果（金）革命者得到了新生。大海航行靠舵手，干世界革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    他们说：毛泽东思想给刚果（金）革命指明了方向，尽管在革命道路上还会有各种困难和曲折，但是刚果（金）人民对革命胜利充满了信心。因为毛主席教导我们：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”胜利一定属于我们革命的刚果（金）人民。
    这两位刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会负责人指出：坚持进行长期的武装斗争是刚果（金）人民取得民族独立和解放的唯一道路。这一经验教训是刚果（金）人民和无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的。他们说：“在一九六○年六月三十日卢蒙巴宣布刚果独立后，因为他没有掌握住枪杆子，在比利时殖民当局武装侵略和由美帝国主义操纵的‘联合国军’的夹击下，刚果合法政府被推翻，卢蒙巴自己也被杀害。今天帝国主义及其走狗手里都拿着刀要杀人，我们也要拿起刀来进行武装夺取政权，别无他路可走。”
    他们还愤怒地谴责苏联现代修正主义者对刚果（金）人民武装革命斗争的背叛。
    他们说：苏联现代修正主义者从反面给刚果（金）人民上了一课，苏修要基赞加放弃武装斗争走议会道路，到帝国主义控制下的傀儡政权去当官，结果成了苏联现代修正主义“和平共处”政策的牺牲品。多年来，苏联现代修正主义者千方百计破坏刚果（金）人民的武装斗争，分裂刚果民族独立运动的事例是举不胜举的。最近，苏联现代修正主义者又胡说什么要刚果（金）人民去和蒙博托进行“和解”，那是痴心妄想。
    在谈到将如何更好地进行武装斗争时，他们表示要按照毛主席的这一教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”去做。他们说：“进行武装斗争要依靠群众，特别是发动、组织和武装农民对我们来说就更加重要，因为农民占我国人口的百分之九十以上，工人阶级是领导阶级，但革命还不能从敌人占据的主要城市开始，而只能首先从敌人力量薄弱的广大农村建立革命根据地，然后再夺取城市。”他们继续说：刚果（金）广大的农村和无边无际的森林地区是进行游击战纵横驰骋的大好天地。他们说：伟大领袖毛主席开创的依靠群众，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路，就是我们要遵循的道路。他们还表示：人民战争是打败美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。美帝国主义是纸老虎，是完全可以打败的。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争证明了这一点，为刚果（金）人民做出了榜样。刚果（金）人民有决心进行一场人民战争，把美帝国主义从刚果（金）赶出去，实现民族独立和解放。
    他们强调指出：搞武装斗争就要永远牢记毛主席的教导：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”他们表示，刚果（金）人民一定要把武装斗争进行到底。
    最后，他们一起高声朗读了三遍：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们激动地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝我们心中的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！”
