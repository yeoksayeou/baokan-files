Under the radiant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India (CPI) has led the broad masses of the Indian people to rise up in rebellion.

In India, with a population of five hundred million, the flames of armed agrarian revolutionary struggle and mass resistance are rapidly spreading. The broad revolutionary masses of India have shattered the shackles of modern revisionism and launched a revolutionary storm against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The rise of armed agrarian revolutionary struggle represents the hope and future of India, and it concerns the fate and destiny of five hundred million people.

Last spring, a thunderclap echoed across the Indian land. The revolutionary faction of the CPI mobilized the revolutionary peasants of the Nasalbari region in Darjeeling District to ignite the torch of armed struggle. The Danji traitor clique and a handful of revisionist leaders within the CPI, in collusion with imperialism and the Indian reactionaries, viciously attacked this great revolutionary feat. At that time, the so-called "Congress Party government" of West Bengal openly joined forces with the Indian reactionaries to carry out a bloody suppression of the peasants in Darjeeling. The Chief Minister of Kerala, Namboodiripad, despite wearing the cloak of a "Communist," immediately dispatched police to suppress the peasant struggles in the style of Nasalbari when they emerged in the state. These shocking facts fully expose the CPI revisionists as despicable traitors and accomplices of the Indian reactionaries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, during the first phase of the Chinese revolution, profoundly pointed out the great significance of the peasant movement for the entire people's revolution. Chairman Mao said: "The national revolution needs a great upheaval in the countryside. The Xinhai Revolution lacked this upheaval and thus failed. Now, with this upheaval, it has become an important factor for the completion of the revolution."

Today, the Indian revolution needs a great upheaval in the countryside. The peasants of Nasalbari have ignited the flames of armed struggle, pushing the Indian revolution to a new stage.

The brutal rule of the Congress Party government, the imperialists, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic comprador capitalists have sucked the marrow from the bones of the Indian people, especially the vast masses of workers and peasants, making it impossible for them to live. The Congress Party reactionary government has long been a lackey of British imperialism and now has become a lackey of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, shamelessly implementing a policy of national betrayal and surrender, throwing the Indian nation into the abyss of disaster. To survive and to thoroughly liberate themselves, the Indian people, especially the vast masses of workers and peasants, have no other choice but to take up arms and rebel, to stand tall and make a revolution.

Now, the revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary people of India, under the radiant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, have seen through the counter-revolutionary faces of the Soviet revisionist clique, the Danji traitor clique, and the Indian revisionists like Namboodiripad, and are resolutely waging a struggle against them. The Indian reactionaries and various revisionists are in a state of panic and despair under the impact of the revolutionary torrent.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The victory of the revolution always begins from where the counter-revolutionary forces are relatively weak, develops first, and wins first."

The vast countryside of India is the weakest point of the Indian reactionary rule. Currently, the vigorous armed agrarian revolutionary struggle in India fully demonstrates that the Indian peasants are the most reliable and broadest natural allies of the Indian proletariat and the main force of the revolution.

The revolutionary faction of the CPI and the revolutionary people of India, adhering to the path indicated by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, determine the victorious future of the Indian revolution. Chairman Mao's path is to lead the peasant masses in the countryside to wage guerrilla warfare under the leadership of the proletarian party, to carry out a land revolution, to establish rural base areas, to encircle the cities from the countryside, and finally to seize the cities. This is the only correct path for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to overthrow the rule of imperialism and its lackeys and to achieve liberation.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." This is an unshakable truth of Marxism-Leninism. The people of Telangana, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, once established a people's armed force of two thousand guerrillas and ten thousand militiamen in their struggle against the reactionaries twenty years ago, opening up a guerrilla zone with a population of ten million and distributing nearly one million acres of land. In 1951, the people's armed forces of Telangana were betrayed by traitors like Danji, and the fruits of the revolution were completely lost. Currently, the armed agrarian revolutionary struggles that have erupted in Darjeeling and other regions have laid the foundation for the establishment of a people's army. As long as the revolutionary faction of the CPI adheres to Chairman Mao's military thought of building a people's army, gradually establishes a new type of people's army, firmly grasps Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics of people's war, and engages in long-term and arduous struggles, it will certainly be able to ultimately overthrow the reactionary rule and achieve national victory.

The excellent revolutionary situation in India inspires the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of various countries, and it heavily strikes imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Indian reactionaries. As the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, has taught us: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will definitely achieve victory." We warmly welcome the Indian people's revolution led by the revolutionary faction of the CPI and warmly welcome the victorious development of the Indian agrarian revolutionary armed struggle!

    毛泽东思想照亮了印度革命的胜利道路
    空军学院硬骨头革命造反总团
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，印共革命派领导广大的印度人民，起来造反了。
    在五亿人口的印度，农民革命武装斗争和群众性的抗暴斗争的怒火，正在迅速蔓延。印度广大革命人民打碎了现代修正主义的枷锁，掀起了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命风暴。农民革命武装斗争的兴起，代表着印度的希望和未来，关系着五亿人民的命运和前途。
    去年春天，印度大地上一声春雷，印共革命派发动大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里地区的革命农民，点燃了武装斗争的火炬。丹吉叛徒集团和印共一小撮修正主义的头头们，再一次和帝国主义及印度反动派互相配合，拚命攻击这一伟大的革命壮举。当时，西孟加拉邦的所谓“非国大党政府”，也公然同印度的反动派一起，对大吉岭的农民实行血腥镇压。喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德，尽管披着“共产党人”的外衣，但在该邦一出现纳萨尔巴里式的农民斗争，立即派出警察进行镇压。这些触目惊心的事实，充分暴露出印共修正主义分子是可耻的叛徒，是印度反动派的帮凶。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在中国第一次国内革命战争时期，深刻地指明了农民运动对于整个人民革命的伟大作用。毛主席指出：“国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。辛亥革命没有这个变动，所以失败了。现在有了这个变动，乃是革命完成的重要因素。”
    今天的印度革命，正需要一个大的农村变动。纳萨尔巴里农民点起武装斗争的火焰，把印度革命推到了一个新阶段。
    国大党政府的残暴统治，帝国主义、封建地主、官僚买办资本家的敲骨吸髓的榨取，使印度人民，特别是广大的工农群众活不下去了。国大党反动政府长期以来投靠英帝国主义，现在又投靠美帝国主义和苏修集团，无耻地实行卖国投降政策，把印度民族抛进灾难的深渊。印度人民要活下去，要彻底翻身，除了拿起刀枪造反，挺起腰杆干革命，没有任何别的出路。
    现在，印共革命派和印度革命人民，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，识破了苏修集团、丹吉叛徒集团和印度修正主义分子南布迪里巴德之流的反革命面目，坚决地大造他们的反。印度反动派和形形色色的修正主义分子，在革命洪流的冲击下，已经处于惶惶不可终日的局面。
    毛主席指出：“革命的胜利总是从那些反革命势力比较薄弱的地方首先开始，首先发展，首先胜利”。
    印度广大的农村是印度反动统治最薄弱的地方。当前，轰轰烈烈的印度农民革命武装斗争，充分地显示了印度农民是印度无产阶级最可靠和最广大的天然同盟军，是革命的主力军。
    印共革命派和革命人民，坚持走世界人民伟大领袖毛主席所指引的道路，这决定着印度革命的胜利前途。毛主席的道路，就是在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。这是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民推翻帝国主义及其走狗的统治、获得解放的唯一正确的道路。
    毛主席指出：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是颠扑不破的马克思列宁主义的真理。有着光荣革命传统的印度特仑甘纳人民，在二十年前同反动派的斗争中，曾经建立了有二千人的游击队和一万民兵的人民武装，开辟了拥有一千万人口的游击区，分配了将近一百万英亩的土地。一九五一年，特仑甘纳的人民武装被叛徒丹吉之流出卖后，革命的胜利果实便全部丧失。当前，在大吉岭和其他地区爆发的农民革命武装斗争，准备了建立人民军队的基础。只要印共革命派按照毛主席的人民军队的建军思想，逐步地建立起一支新型的人民军队，牢牢地掌握毛主席的人民战争的战略战术，经过长期的、艰巨的斗争，就一定能够最后推翻反动统治，取得全国的胜利。
    印度的大好革命形势，鼓舞着印度全国人民和各国革命人民，沉重地打击了帝国主义、苏修集团和印度反动派。正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”我们热烈欢呼在印共革命派领导下兴起的印度人民革命，热烈欢呼印度农民革命武装斗争的胜利发展！
