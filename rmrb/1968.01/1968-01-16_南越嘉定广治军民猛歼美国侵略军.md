Responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, the people and armed forces of South Vietnam bravely fight, displaying heroic courage and fierce combat spirit.

The people's armed forces in Gia Dinh Province annihilate 600 enemy troops in a 90-minute battle; the liberation forces in Quang Tri Province cleverly launch a surprise attack, wiping out half a company of American troops.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, the people's liberation armed forces in Gia Dinh and Quang Tri Provinces in South Vietnam have been resolutely responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front's call to fight against American aggression and save the nation. They have been continuously attacking and ambushing the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on the American aggressors, who are crying in pain.

According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, at midnight on the 10th, the people's liberation armed forces in Gia Dinh Province launched a fierce attack on a camp of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division guarding Highway 1 in Go Vap District. The people's liberation armed forces, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, quickly rushed forward and engaged in close combat with the enemy. After just 90 minutes of battle, they killed and wounded 600 American aggressors and seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

Gia Dinh Province is adjacent to the enemy stronghold of Saigon. The local people's liberation armed forces are brave and skilled in battle, annihilating a large number of American aggressors. According to reports, in December alone, local military and civilians killed and wounded nearly 2,000 American aggressors and completely wiped out five companies of American troops.

According to a report by a Western news agency, on the 13th, the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Tri Province launched a brilliant ambush near the demilitarized zone. According to the enemy's reduced figures, in this battle, the people's liberation armed forces wiped out more than half of a company of U.S. Marines.

The report said that the company of American aggressors was then riding in more than ten military vehicles, protected by tanks, heading to the Carol Camp. When they reached about ten kilometers south of the demilitarized zone, they were suddenly attacked by the people's liberation armed forces. The local military and civilians, hidden on both sides of the road, unexpectedly opened fire on the enemy. Following that, the pre-buried landmines exploded one after another among the enemy's vehicles. The American aggressors jumped out of their vehicles in panic, but the dense automatic weapon fire from the people's liberation armed forces mowed them down. The American aggressors lay dead and wounded everywhere. After the battle, a U.S. Marine Corps captain exclaimed, "The people's liberation armed forces' ambush plan was well thought out and executed very well."

Previously, on the 12th, the people's liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province also heavily bombarded a command post of a U.S. Marine Corps company with mortars, killing and wounding many American aggressors.

According to another report, after annihilating more than 280 enemy troops in the Duy Xuyen and Dong Xuyen areas on December 27th and 28th last year, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on the military outpost in Phuoc Loc County and its surrounding three enemy outposts in the early hours of January 3rd this year. The liberation army successfully captured these three outposts and severely damaged the enemy's Phuoc Loc military outpost.

Meanwhile, the artillery units of the Quang Nam Province liberation army heavily shelled the American aggressors stationed about one kilometer west of Tuy Hoa, causing the enemy's ammunition depot to explode. Another unit of the liberation army fiercely attacked the Li Son military outpost to the northwest of Tuy Hoa, capturing and destroying two-thirds of the buildings and bunkers inside the military outpost, annihilating hundreds of enemy troops.

On the same night, the Quang Nam Province liberation army, riding on the momentum of victory, attacked the base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division's 3rd Brigade in the Khe Sanh area and the logistics base and surrounding artillery positions of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division on Hill 63 north of Song Be, completely disabling the enemy's artillery positions.

    南越嘉定广治军民猛歼美国侵略军
    嘉定省人民武装九十分钟战斗一举歼敌六百　广治省解放武装力量巧打伏击战一次吃掉美军半个连
    据新华社十五日讯 越南南方嘉定、广治等地人民解放武装力量，坚决响应胡志明主席和南方民族解放阵线抗美救国的战斗号召，不断进攻和伏击敌人，杀得美国侵略者死伤枕籍，叫苦连天。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，十日凌晨，嘉定省人民解放武装力量对驻在古芝县守卫一号公路的美国第二十五步兵师的一个营的侵略军，发动了猛烈袭击。人民解放武装力量怀着对美国强盗的深仇大恨，迅速冲上前去，同敌人展开短兵相接的肉搏战，只经过九十分钟的战斗，就打死打伤美国侵略者六百名，并缴获大批武器和弹药。
    嘉定省紧靠美伪集团巢穴西贡市，这个省的人民解放武装力量英勇善战，消灭了美国强盗大批有生力量。据报道，单单去年十二月份，当地军民就打死打伤美国侵略军近二千名，全歼美军五个连。
    另据西方通讯社报道，广治省人民解放武装力量，十三日在非军事区附近打了一仗漂亮的伏击战。据敌人缩小了的数字，在这一仗中人民解放武装力量把一个连的美国海军陆战队吃掉了一半以上。
    报道说，这连美国侵略者当时乘着十几辆军车，在坦克的掩护下开往卡罗尔营地，当行驶到非军事区以南约十公里的地方，遭到了人民解放武装力量“惊人有效的袭击”。隐蔽在公路两旁的广治省军民等敌人进入伏击圈后，出其不意地向敌人猛烈开火，接着，事先埋好的地雷也接二连三地在敌人的军车间爆炸。美国强盗慌忙跳车逃命，但是人民解放武装力量的“密集的自动武器火力把他们扫射倒地”，美国强盗横尸遍野，死伤累累。战斗过后，美国海军陆战队的一个营长惊呼，人民解放武装力量“这次伏击计划周到，并且执行得很好”。
    在这以前，承天省人民解放武装力量，十二日也曾用迫击炮猛烈轰击美国海军陆战队一个营的指挥所，打死打伤许多美国强盗。
    另据报道，广南省军民继去年十二月二十七日和二十八日在奠盘县和东盘地区歼灭敌军二百八十多名之后，在今年一月三日凌晨，又猛烈袭击先福县福林军事支区及其周围的三个敌军据点。解放军一举攻克了这三个据点，并且严重破坏敌人福林军事支区。
    与此同时广南省解放军的炮兵部队也猛烈炮击驻在离朱莱西面一公里的美国侵略军，使敌人的弹药库爆炸。另一支解放军则猛烈袭击朱莱西北面的里信军事支区，占领和摧毁这个军事支区内的三分之二的建筑物和碉堡，消灭数以百计的敌人。
    当天夜间，广南省解放军乘胜袭击美国第一骑兵师第三旅在桂山地区的驻地和美国第一骑兵师在升平北面六三高地上的野营后勤基地及其周围的炮兵阵地，使敌人的炮兵阵地全部瘫痪。
