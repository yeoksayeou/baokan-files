The revolutionary study class organized by the Revolutionary Workers' United Front Consultative Conference in Xi'an Region has established a revolutionary learning style. Participants from various revolutionary mass organizations have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, linked theory with practice, and engaged in self-criticism. This has strengthened and developed the revolutionary united front and laid a solid ideological foundation for the formal establishment of the Xi'an Region and Shaanxi Province Workers' Congress.

The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations emphasized during the study that linking theory with practice first requires linking it with one's own ideological reality. In linking with one's own ideological reality, it is crucial to first address one's own ideological issues and solve one's own ideological problems. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes; let the other side speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes. Each side should engage in more self-criticism, seek common ground while reserving differences." Through repeated study, everyone recognized that whether one engages in serious self-criticism is an important marker distinguishing genuine revolutionaries from those who merely talk about revolution. True proletarian revolutionaries, when they have shortcomings and mistakes, should engage in serious self-criticism and correct them promptly. Tolerating and indulging in one's own shortcomings and mistakes is a crime against the revolutionary cause and a betrayal of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Only by engaging in more self-criticism and resolutely correcting one's own shortcomings and mistakes can one follow Chairman Mao and advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line. With heightened ideological awareness, everyone took up the weapon of self-criticism and exposed their own shortcomings.

The study class also emphasized that in linking with one's own ideological reality, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations should first link with their own ideological reality and change the situation where leaders lag behind the masses. Chairman Mao says: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." This is indeed the case. Even before the establishment of the Revolutionary Workers' United Front Consultative Conference in Xi'an Region, there were already many factories and enterprises in Xi'an Region where revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teachings, achieved revolutionary unity by system and by team. In some units, the leaders could not reach an agreement at the conference table, but the masses below had already achieved revolutionary unity. This shows that the broad masses of workers have a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and follow it closely. They are the most intelligent and talented. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations who participated in the study class, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and linking them with the actual situations of some factories and enterprises, deeply felt that in implementing revolutionary unity, they had fallen behind the masses. The shortcomings and mistakes on their side were primarily their own. Therefore, everyone first linked with their own erroneous thoughts and engaged in self-criticism. They deeply felt that they must remember Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions: to regard oneself as a force for the revolution and at the same time, to continually regard oneself as an object of the revolution. Countless facts have proven that without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well.

Everyone, based on the problems encountered and the experiences and lessons learned in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, clearly proposed in the study class that they must strive to achieve four correct attitudes: First, correctly treating Chairman Mao's instructions, definitely being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and definitely implementing them after studying them, with immediate results. Second, correctly treating the masses, definitely living and fighting among the masses, and consulting with the masses on matters. Third, correctly treating oneself, definitely regarding oneself as an object of the revolution; to establish the style of linking theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the people, and the style of self-criticism. Fourth, correctly treating the two types of contradictions, being ruthless towards class enemies and adopting the principle of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" for contradictions among the people. Everyone believed that by striving to achieve these four correct attitudes, they could become proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations also discussed the issue of revolutionary unity in the study class under the guideline of "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism." Currently, they are actively preparing to convene the Workers' Congress of Xi'an Region and Shaanxi Province, determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and make new contributions to consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

    西安地区革命工人大联合协商代表会学习班建立革命好学风
    用毛泽东思想之矢射自我革命之的
    巩固和发展了革命大联合，为正式成立西安地区和陕西省工代会打下了思想基础
    据新华社西安四日电　西安地区革命工人大联合协商代表会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，建立了革命的好学风，参加学习的各革命群众组织的负责人活学活用毛主席著作，理论联系实际，各自多做自我批评，从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合，为正式成立西安地区和陕西省工人代表大会打下了良好的思想基础。
    各革命群众组织负责人在学习中强调，理论联系实际，首先要联系思想实际。在联系思想实际中，又首先要联系自己一方的思想实际，解决自己一方的思想问题。毛主席教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”经过反复学习，大家认识到，有无认真的自我批评，这是区别真正革命派和口头革命派的重要标志之一。真正的无产阶级革命派，有了缺点、错误，就应该认真地进行自我批评，坚决迅速地改正。容忍、迁就自己的缺点、错误，就是对革命事业的犯罪，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的不忠。只有多做自我批评，坚决改正自己的缺点、错误，才能紧跟毛主席，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。思想觉悟提高了，大家都拿起自我批评的武器，各自揭自己的疮疤。
    学习班还强调，在联系自己一方的思想实际中，革命群众组织负责人要首先联系自己的思想实际，改变领导落后于群众的局面。毛主席说：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”事实正是这样，还在西安地区革命工人大联合协商代表会成立之前，西安地区就有一批工厂企业的革命群众，遵照毛主席的教导，按系统按班组实现了革命大联合。有的单位，头头在会议桌上谈不拢，而群众在下面已经实现了革命大联合。这说明，广大工人群众对毛主席的伟大战略部署，理解得深，跟得紧，他们表现得最聪明，最有才能。在学习班学习的各革命群众组织负责人学习了毛主席的最新指示，联系一些工厂企业的实际情况，深深感到在实行革命大联合这方面，自己已经落在群众后面了，自己方面的缺点、错误首先在于自己。于是，大家首先联系自己的错误思想，展开了自我批评。他们深有体会地说，必须牢记林彪副主席的指示，要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。无数事实证明，不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。
    大家根据一年多来在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中遇到的问题和取得的经验教训，在学习班中明确地提出，自己必须努力做到四个正确对待：第一，正确对待毛主席的指示，一定要无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的指示，一定要学了就用，认真执行，立竿见影。第二，正确对待群众，一定要生活、战斗在群众之中，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。第三，正确对待自己，一定要不断把自己当作革命的对象；要树立理论联系实际的作风，密切和人民群众相联系的作风，自我批评的作风。第四，正确对待两类不同性质的矛盾，对阶级敌人一定要狠，对人民内部矛盾一定要采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方针。大家认为，努力做到了这四个正确对待，才能成为决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    各个革命群众组织负责人在学习班中还以“斗私，批修”为纲，讨论了革命大联合的问题。目前，他们正积极筹备召开西安地区和陕西省的工代会，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合作出新的贡献。
