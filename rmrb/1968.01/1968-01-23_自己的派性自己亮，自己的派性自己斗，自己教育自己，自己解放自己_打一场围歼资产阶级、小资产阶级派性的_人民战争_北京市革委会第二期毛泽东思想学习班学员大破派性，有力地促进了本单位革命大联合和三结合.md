Participants in the second session of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class organized by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee have launched a "people's war" to eradicate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they resolutely smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, effectively promoting revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination in their respective units.

The second session of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class organized by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee had over a thousand participants. These participants came from various sectors across the city, including industry, agriculture, finance, trade, education, and party and government agencies. The leadership group of the study class, after thoroughly studying the situations of the units sending participants, concluded that the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution lies in developing and consolidating revolutionary great unity and promoting the three-in-one combination. However, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the biggest obstacle to consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and promoting the three-in-one combination. Therefore, they decided to make exposing and smashing factionalism the primary task of this session.

When the participants first arrived at the study class, they all carried varying degrees of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some from the two factions brought materials for "internal warfare," ready to engage in a major conflict; others wanted the PLA comrades in the study class to judge who was "revolutionary" and who was "conservative." Those with strong factionalism believed that all mistakes were made by the other side, and that they had nothing to criticize themselves for. Their purpose in coming to the study class was to collect ammunition to attack the other side. Facing this situation, the leadership group of the study class emphasized the importance of upholding the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, deeply understanding and applying Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, conducting self-criticism, and thoroughly smashing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their respective units. The leadership group pointed out: whether one can do this, and whether one is willing to eliminate factionalism, is a test of loyalty to Chairman Mao and of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It is a crucial indicator of whether one is a genuine proletarian revolutionary or a captive of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. The leadership group stressed: participants must reveal their own factionalism, fight their own factionalism, educate themselves, and liberate themselves. They guided the participants to thoroughly expose the crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, dig out its roots, and launch a "people's war" to thoroughly expose and smash factionalism, ensuring that factionalism is completely eliminated.

The two factions in the Housing Management Bureau of Chongwen District had been engaged in "internal warfare" without pause. After arriving at the study class, the leaders of these two factions saw the atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness, and were deeply moved by the participants' deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao as they seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and conducted self-criticism. They resolved to jump out of the quagmire of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Yao Qingxiang, a leader of one faction, voluntarily criticized his mistakes made during the process of revolutionary great unity. Seeing Yao Qingxiang's earnest struggle against factionalism, Yuan Baoxin from the other faction immediately abandoned his previous erroneous approach of finding faults and loopholes in the other side and exchanged views with Yao Qingxiang, discovering that both sides had the same revolutionary direction but had magnified some minor issues due to factionalism, leading to unending "internal warfare." Following Yao Qingxiang and Yuan Baoxin's lead, other leaders from both sides also eagerly revealed their personal interests and fought their own factionalism. The more they revealed their personal interests and fought factionalism, the deeper their proletarian feelings became, and the closer they got to each other. Finally, both sides publicly exposed their "secret strategies and tactics" aimed at undermining the other side, criticizing and denouncing them. They deeply felt: "Without Mao Zedong Thought, there is no proletarian revolutionary." Recently, they returned to their unit together and reported to over two thousand employees about their earnest struggle against factionalism, publicly exposing their mistakes and asking the masses for criticism, which was warmly welcomed. The revolutionary masses of both factions finally united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Recently, they have also seriously studied the editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism" from Wenhui Bao, gaining a deeper understanding of the evil nature of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They expressed their determination to fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly eliminate the poison of factionalism, resolutely smash factionalism, and level the ideological hills, quickly achieving the three-in-one combination and establishing a revolutionary committee.

Participants from the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau who attended the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class severely criticized the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism manifested in the cadre issue. After that, everyone acted according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Chairman Mao's cadre policy to evaluate cadres, strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, and laying a good ideological foundation for the Education Bureau to achieve the three-in-one combination. With factionalism smashed, Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their hearts, and now both sides feel that the other side has many admirable qualities worth learning from, repeatedly affirming each other's organizational direction, making the revolutionary great unity more solid.

After studying at the class, the participants armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, raised their ideological and political awareness, and gained a deep understanding of the reactionary nature of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some leaders of mass organizations, seeing that they had been entangled by this big poisonous snake of factionalism, were shocked. They conducted profound self-criticism, digging out the root of factionalism—the "self." Some painfully said: in the early stages of the movement, they had a pure red heart and rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. However, due to neglecting the transformation of their worldview, they were blinded by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. To topple the other side, they even learned the corrupt political style of the bourgeoisie, acting one way in public and another in private, shaking hands on stage and kicking under the table. This shows that they had been severely infiltrated by bourgeois ideology. If they did not wake up and turn back, they would fall into an irredeemable state.

After studying at the class, the participants expressed their determination: after returning to their units, they would definitely be the vanguard in smashing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, turning the reporting meeting to the masses into a mobilization meeting to smash factionalism, resolutely smashing and denouncing factionalism, eliminating all its poison, uniting the masses, and seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    打一场围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”
    北京市革委会第二期毛泽东思想学习班学员大破派性，有力地促进了本单位革命大联合和三结合
    新华社二十二日讯　参加北京市革命委员会举办的第二期毛泽东思想学习班学习的学员，开展围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，有力地促进了本单位的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    北京市革命委员会举办的第二期毛泽东思想学习班共有学员一千多人。这些学员，来自全市工、农、财贸、文教战线和党政机关。学习班的领导小组认真研究了派人来学习的各单位的情况后认为，在这些单位全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的前提和关键，是发展和巩固革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合；而资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，又是巩固和发展革命大联合，促进革命三结合的最大障碍。因此，决定把搞臭派性、打倒派性作为这期学习班的重点任务。
    学员刚到学习班的时候，都带有不同程度的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。有的两派的群众各自带来了打“内战”的材料，准备在学习班里大干一场；有的要学习班的解放军同志裁判谁“革”谁“保”。派性十分强烈的人，认为错误都是对方的，自己无私可斗，来学习班的目的，是收集攻击对方的“子弹”。针对这种情况，学习班领导小组强调发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，对毛主席著作，对毛主席的最新指示，要深刻领会，学了就用，要对照检查自己的思想，多做自我批评，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，保证毛主席的最新指示在本单位全面落实。学习班领导小组指出：能不能做到这一点，肯不肯破除派性，是忠不忠于毛主席、紧跟不紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的问题，是证明你要做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，还是做资产阶级、小资产阶级俘虏的重要标志。学习班领导小组强调：学员要自己的派性自己亮，自己的派性自己斗，自己教育自己，自己解放自己。他们引导学员大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的罪状，大挖派性的老根，发动学员上下促进（群众组织的头头和群众互相促进），内外夹攻（来学习班的和留在本单位的一齐揭发派性的罪状），打一场围歼派性的“人民战争”，把派性彻底搞臭，打倒。
    崇文区房管局的两派群众组织，“内战”一直不停。这两派群众组织的负责人来到学习班以后，看到学习班充满团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的政治空气，学员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，对照检查自己的私心和派性，深受感动。他们下定决心要从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的泥坑里跳出来。一派群众组织的负责人姚庆祥主动检查了自己在革命大联合过程中所犯的错误。另一派组织的负责人袁宝新看到姚庆祥认真狠斗派性，就立即放弃自己原来想找对方的“短处”和“漏洞”的错误作法，并同姚庆祥交换了观点，发现双方的斗争大方向是一致的，但由于派性作怪，把一些枝节问题扩大化了，以致发展到“内战”打个不停。在姚庆祥和袁宝新的带动下，双方的其他负责人也都争着亮自己的私心，斗自己的派性。他们越亮私心，越斗派性，双方的无产阶级感情越深厚，越接近，最后双方都把企图瓦解对方的“绝密战略、战术”公布出来，批倒批臭。他们深有感触地说：“什么你这派，我那派，离开毛泽东思想就不是无产阶级革命派”。前些时候，他们肩并肩地一起回到本单位，向两千多名职工汇报了自己狠斗派性的情况，把自己所做的错事都公布出来，请广大群众批评，受到大家的热烈欢迎。两派的革命群众终于在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来了。最近他们又认真地学习了《文汇报》社论《论派性的反动性》，对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的罪恶有了更深刻的认识，他们表示一定要充分发动群众，彻底肃清派性的流毒，坚决把派性搞臭，从思想上彻底铲平山头，尽快实现革命的三结合，成立革命委员会。
    北京市教育局两派革命群众组织参加毛泽东思想学习班学习的学员，狠批了在干部问题上表现出来的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性以后，大家都照毛主席的最新指示办事，用毛主席的干部政策衡量干部，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，为教育局实现革命三结合打下了良好的思想基础。派性打倒了，毛泽东思想照亮了他们的心，现在双方都感到对方有许多优点值得自己学习，互相再三肯定对方组织的大方向，使革命的大联合更加巩固。
    学员们在学习班里用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，提高了思想政治觉悟，对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动性有了深刻的认识。有的群众组织的负责人看到自己已被派性这条大毒蛇缠住，不觉大吃一惊，他们做了深刻的自我批评，挖出了派性的毒根——“私”字。有的沉痛地说：运动初期，自己怀着一颗纯洁的红心，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，可是由于自己忽略了世界观的改造，被资产阶级、小资产阶级派性迷住了心窍。为了搞垮对方，竟学会了当面一套，背后一套，台上握手，台下踢脚的腐朽的资产阶级政客作风。这说明自己已受到资产阶级思想的严重侵蚀，如果再不猛醒回头，就会堕落到不可救药的地步。
    学员们经过在学习班的学习，纷纷表示决心：回到本单位以后，一定要当打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的先锋，把向广大群众的汇报会，当成打倒派性的动员会，坚决把派性搞臭打倒，肃清它的一切流毒，使广大群众团结起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
