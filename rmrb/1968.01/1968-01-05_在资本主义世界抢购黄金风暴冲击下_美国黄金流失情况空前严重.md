	Under the impact of the gold-buying storm in the capitalist world, the United States is facing an unprecedented situation of gold loss. According to a report from the U.S. President Johnson on the first day of announcing his "emergency measures" to rescue the dollar, the U.S. Treasury Department revealed on the third day the severe situation of the large-scale loss of U.S. gold reserves caused by the devaluation of the pound: under the impact of the gold speculation frenzy in Western Europe, the U.S. gold reserves in December last year alone saw a loss of gold worth $925 million. This is nearly double the $574 million worth of gold lost by the U.S. in the entire year of 1966. The U.S. losing so much gold in a single month is unprecedented in history. No wonder Johnson had to panic and announce his emergency plan to reduce the U.S. international trade deficit on New Year's Day.

	According to official statistics from Washington: due to the large-scale loss of U.S. gold reserves, the U.S. Treasury Department currently holds only $12 billion in gold reserves, dropping to the lowest point in 30 years. However, of this $12 billion in gold, $10.5 billion is used to support domestic paper currency. Therefore, the gold actually available to the U.S. government for international exchange is only $1.5 billion.

	However, currently, there are more than $2.5 billion in dollars in the European market that can be demanded for gold redemption at any time. Therefore, Johnson had to publicly announce that he would ask the U.S. Congress to cancel the regulation that requires 25% of U.S. currency to be backed by gold, so that all of the U.S.'s gold reserves can be used to deal with the potential dollar-to-gold run in foreign countries. However, even this can only be a temporary fix. According to official U.S. statistics, the total amount of dollars and dollar-denominated bonds held by foreigners that can be redeemed for gold at any time is currently $30.8 billion, nearly three times the U.S.'s total gold reserves of $12 billion; this is in stark contrast to ten years ago when the U.S. had $22.1 billion in gold reserves and foreigners held only $15.3 billion in dollars and dollar-denominated bonds. It is precisely because of this that the U.S. ruling class is so terrified and anxious about the dollar crisis, and to this day, they have not come up with any effective countermeasures.

### 在资本主义世界抢购黄金风暴冲击下  美国黄金流失情况空前严重

    在资本主义世界抢购黄金风暴冲击下
    美国黄金流失情况空前严重
    本报讯　在美国总统约翰逊一日宣布了他的抢救美元的“紧急措施”之后，美国财政部三日终于透露了英镑贬值后所造成的美国黄金大量流失的严重情况：在西欧抢购黄金投机风潮的冲击下，美国黄金储备在去年十二月一个月内就流失了价值达九亿二千五百万美元的黄金。这比一九六六年全年美国流失的五亿七千四百万美元的黄金，几乎超出一倍。美国在一个月内损失这样多的黄金，这在历史上还是空前的。难怪约翰逊要惊惶失措地在元旦之日来宣布他的减少美国国际收支赤字的应急计划了。
    根据华盛顿官方统计：由于美国黄金大量流失，美国财政部目前拥有的黄金储备，只剩下一百二十亿美元，落到三十年来的最低点。但在这一百二十亿美元的黄金中，有一百零五亿美元又是用来作为支持国内纸币用的。因此，美国政府用于应付国际兑换的黄金，实际上不过十五亿美元。
    但是，目前单是在欧洲市场上随时可能要求提兑黄金的美元，就达二十五亿美元以上。因此，约翰逊不得不公开宣布，他将要求美国国会取消美钞应有百分之二十五的黄金作为后备的规定，以便使美国的全部黄金储备都可动用来应付国外可能发生的用美元挤兑黄金的风潮。可是，即便这样，也只能是救一时之急。因为根据美国官方的统计，目前外国人手中持有的随时可向美国财政部兑换黄金的美元和美元债券，总数已达到三百零八亿美元，接近于美国全部黄金储备一百二十亿美元的三倍；这比起十年前美国拥有二百二十一亿美元黄金储备，而外国人手中持有的美元和美元债券只有一百五十三亿美元的比例来，已不可同日而语。正是因为这样，美国统治集团才对美元危机的风暴，如此惊恐不安，至今拿不出什么有效的对策。
