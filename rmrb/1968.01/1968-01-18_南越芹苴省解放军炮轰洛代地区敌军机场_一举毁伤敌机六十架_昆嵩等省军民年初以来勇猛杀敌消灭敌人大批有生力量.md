The Liberation Army of Kien Giang Province in South Vietnam heavily bombarded the enemy's airfield in the Loc Ninh area on December 21 last year, destroying 29 enemy aircraft and damaging 31 others.

During this attack, the Liberation Army also destroyed and damaged eight enemy vehicles, burned 150,000 liters of fuel, destroyed one radar device, and annihilated a large number of American and puppet troops. The accurate shelling by the Liberation Army hit the airfield's parking aprons, fuel storage, and vehicle parking areas, causing thunderous explosions, thick smoke, and raging fires, plunging the enemy into chaos.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and people of Kontum, Gia Lai, Binh Dinh, and My Tho provinces in South Vietnam, inspired by the new battle call issued by President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, have been fighting bravely since the beginning of the year, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

From January 7 to 12, the Liberation Army in Kontum Province launched continuous and fierce attacks on the enemy, killing 335 enemy troops, including 250 American invaders, shooting down and destroying 33 enemy aircraft, and destroying and damaging 109 enemy vehicles.

On the night of January 8, the Liberation Army in Gia Lai Province attacked the U.S. engineering base inside Pleiku City, annihilating a company of American invaders and 130 American engineering technicians, destroying 20 enemy vehicles, and demolishing 20 barracks.

On January 10, the Liberation Army in Binh Dinh Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 180-meter-high mountain stronghold in the border area between Phu My and Phu Cat counties, where the puppet army's 41st Regiment's 2nd Battalion was stationed. The soldiers of the Liberation Army fought closely together, bravely charging forward, and captured the enemy stronghold in just 15 minutes of intense battle, annihilating an entire enemy battalion and seizing 40 enemy weapons.

On the night of January 8, the Liberation Army in My Tho Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 12th Regiment's 2nd Battalion of the puppet army's 7th Division, stationed in Hau Thanh Commune, Cai Lay County. After an intense battle, the Liberation Army annihilated nearly 350 enemy troops and seized a large number of enemy weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.
