The nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in an excellent situation, not just a good situation. The overall situation is better than ever before. In a few more months, the situation will be even better.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions inspire the people of Jinggangshan to advance to victory. The Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee is born in this excellent situation.

Twenty thousand military personnel and civilians hold a grand celebration meeting, jointly wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

The 22 million heroic people of Jinggangshan are determined to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," to make the first red revolutionary base personally established by Chairman Mao into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and to spread the torch of Jinggangshan lit by Chairman Mao throughout the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 6th: In the midst of the nationwide call to arms by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, news has come from the first revolutionary base personally established by our great leader Chairman Mao: the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee has been established!

Our sun in the heart, Chairman Mao, has always been deeply concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province. Chairman Mao personally inspected Jiangxi and gave great and wise instructions. Chairman Mao's great concern has given the heroic people of Jinggangshan the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, and the greatest strength. They have high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fought and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi. They have continuously developed and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The red flag of Jinggangshan is flying in the wind. On January 5th, the capital of Jiangxi Province, Nanchang, was in a state of joy. More than 200,000 revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army from all fronts in the province gathered from all directions to the People's Square, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," to solemnly celebrate the birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration meeting began with the majestic music of "The East is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, the entire venue was in a state of joy, with thunderous applause. People raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live, long live, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and an important sign of the unprecedentedly excellent situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It announces the complete failure of the plot by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, such as Fang Zhiping, to restore capitalism. At this moment of joy in celebrating the birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, the people of Jinggangshan jointly wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

The 22 million people of Jinggangshan with a glorious revolutionary tradition are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and love Mao Zedong Thought the most. Forty years ago, Chairman Mao ignited the spark of revolution on Jinggangshan. Since then, the people of Jinggangshan have always followed the great leader Chairman Mao, with red hearts and souls, making great contributions to the Chinese revolution. In more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic people of Jinggangshan bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fought a sharp and intense struggle against a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The people of Jinggangshan, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have inherited and carried forward the firm and thorough revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, "pointing at the mountains and rivers, stirring up the words," united as one, fought bravely, and repeatedly broke through the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They finally exposed Fang Zhiping and other small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seized back the power they had usurped into the hands of the revolutionary masses, and opened a new page in the glorious history of the red revolutionary base.

At the critical moment of the struggle, the People's Liberation Army, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "supporting the leftist broad masses," firmly supported the revolutionary masses. In the "three supports and two militaries" work, they made outstanding contributions.

Look at today, Jinggangshan's grand blueprint is unfolding. The revolutionary torrent rolls forward, and industrial and agricultural production is booming. The great Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, people's proletarian consciousness has never been as high as it is today, and people's revolutionary spirit has never been as vigorous as it is today. The people of Jinggangshan have formed a vast revolutionary army, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and are welcoming the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the celebration meeting, Comrade Cheng Shiqing, the head of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, spoke. He said, "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The victory of the power seizure struggle of the Jiangxi proletarian revolutionary masses relies on the great helmsman Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, to hold power well and use power well, it still relies on the great helmsman Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

He said that the establishment of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee is "only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li," and our future tasks are more glorious, more arduous, and more magnificent. The most fundamental task in the future is to further spread Chairman Mao's voice to the people of the entire province, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply. With Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, we will carry out the ideological revolution of the people, and from the ideological, political, economic, and organizational aspects, we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and carry it through to the end.

Comrade Cheng Shiqing stressed that Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, and is the red sun in our hearts that will never set. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The deepest feeling of the people of Jinggangshan is that as long as we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible and unstoppable. Following the great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest glory of the people of Jinggangshan. The people of Jinggangshan will definitely forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will do our best, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, to propagate, study, implement, and carry out each of Chairman Mao's instructions. We will focus on ideological and political work, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, carry out the ideological revolution of the people, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, reform everything, promote everything, and occupy all positions, just like Comrade Li Wenzhong, the model of supporting the left and loving the people, "Chairman Mao loves me, I love; Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

Comrade Cheng Shiqing called on the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the entire province to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, we will genuinely establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, criticize revisionism, and continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, promote and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, rectify the Party organization, strengthen Party building, further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, enhance revolutionary vigilance, seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects.

Comrade Cheng Shiqing finally said that Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Party Central Committee have given high evaluations and cherished expectations to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province. We, the people of Jinggangshan, must "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, strive for progress, and forever revolutionize and advance. We will definitely be the promoters of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, make the first red revolutionary base personally established by Chairman Mao into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and spread the torch of Jinggangshan lit by Chairman Mao throughout the world, letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine over the globe.

Comrade Ji Ruihua, the political instructor of the 6th Company of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, representing all soldiers and officers of the Jiangxi garrison, spoke at the meeting. He said, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle.' We, all soldiers and officers, firmly support the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee. We will forever follow Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao with our lives, and like Comrade Li Wenzhong, 'live to fight for Chairman Mao and die to sacrifice for Chairman Mao.' We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, continue to emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, promote the three-eight style, carry forward the three great democracies, and better carry out the four-good company movement. We will raise the revolutionary and modernized construction of our army to a higher level, further do a good job in the 'three supports and two militaries' work, further do a good job in the work of loving the people, firmly implement Chairman Mao's great instructions of seizing the revolution and promoting production, work, and preparedness, strengthen preparedness, consolidate national defense, and be ready at any time to crush the enemy's war provocations. In defending the great motherland and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new merits for the motherland and the people."

The Jiangxi proletarian revolutionary cadres' great alliance preparatory committee and representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards spoke at the meeting with revolutionary enthusiasm, warmly congratulating the birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee. They unanimously pointed out that the establishment of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee does not mean the end of the revolution but is a new starting point for the revolution. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, with "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, genuinely establish and carry out Mao Zedong Thought study classes, push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide, learn to a new level, and apply to a new level. The people of Jinggangshan firmly and unshakably declare: Heaven changes, earth changes, but our red heart loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought will never change! Earthquakes and landslides, but the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will never waver! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned! Chairman Mao's instructions will be followed sentence by sentence, word by word, and forever followed! We have unlimited love, unlimited faith, unlimited admiration, and unlimited loyalty to the great leader!

The meeting, in the midst of thunderous applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

The meeting also passed a letter of congratulations to all soldiers and officers of the Jiangxi garrison of the People's Liberation Army.

After the meeting, Comrade Cheng Shiqing, the head of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, and Comrades Yang Dongliang, Huang Xian, Yu Houde, Wan Lilang, and the committee members of the Revolutionary Committee, together with the revolutionary masses, held a grand parade.

    毛主席最新指示鼓舞井冈山儿女胜利前进  江西省革命委员会在大好形势下光荣诞生
    二十万军民隆重举行庆祝大会共同祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    两千二百万英雄的井冈山儿女决心“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，把毛主席亲手创建的第一个红色革命根据地办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把毛主席亲自点燃的井冈山火炬燃遍全世界
    新华社南昌六日电　在全国亿万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，从我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的第一个革命老根据地，传来了振奋人心的喜讯：江西省革命委员会成立了！
    我们心中的红太阳毛主席，一直非常关心江西省的无产阶级文化大革命运动。毛主席亲临江西视察，作了伟大的英明的指示。毛主席的伟大关怀，给了英雄的井冈山儿女最大的鼓舞，最大的教育，最大的力量。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠斗猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，不断发展和巩固革命的大联合、革命的三结合，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    井冈山红旗迎风飘扬。一月五日，江西省省会南昌市一片欢腾。全省各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员二十多万人，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手执红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，从四面八方汇集到人民广场，隆重庆祝江西省革命委员会的诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告江西省革命委员会胜利诞生时，全场欢腾，掌声雷动。人们振臂欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    江西省革命委员会的光荣诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是全国无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好的一个重要标志。它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人方志纯等党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产。井冈山儿女在欢庆江西省革命委员会诞生的幸福时刻，共同祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    富有光荣革命传统的两千二百万井冈山儿女，最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话，最热爱毛泽东思想。四十年前，毛主席在井冈山点燃了革命星火。从那时起，井冈山儿女始终紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，赤胆忠心闹革命，为中国革命作出了伟大贡献。在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，英雄的井冈山儿女勇敢地保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同党内一小撮走资派进行了尖锐、激烈的斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。忠于毛主席的井冈山儿女，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，继承和发扬井冈山坚定彻底的革命精神，“指点江山，激扬文字”，团结一致，英勇奋战，一次又一次地从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀出来，终于揪出了方志纯等党内一小撮走资派，把他们所窃取的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，开创了红色革命根据地光辉历史的崭新一页。
    在斗争的紧要关头，中国人民解放军遵照伟大领袖毛主席“支持左派广大群众”的教导，最坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了卓越的贡献。
    看今朝，井冈万里展宏图。革命洪流滚滚向前，工农业生产热气腾腾。伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，人们的无产阶级觉悟从来没有象今天这样高，人们的革命精神从来没有象今天这样昂扬。井冈山儿女结成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正在迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在庆祝大会上，江西省革命委员会主任程世清同志讲了话。他说，“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。江西省无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，靠的是伟大舵手毛主席，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。今后要掌好权、用好权，靠的还是伟大舵手毛主席，靠的还是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    他说，江西省革命委员会的成立，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，我们今后的任务更光荣、更艰巨、更伟大。今后最根本的任务，就是进一步向全省人民传播毛主席的声音，把毛主席的最新指示全面落实，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    程世清同志强调说，毛主席是我们的伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手，是我们心中永远永远不落的红太阳。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。伟大的毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义。我们井冈山儿女最深切的体会，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来，我们就无往不胜，无坚不摧。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，就是我们井冈山儿女最大的光荣传统。我们井冈山儿女一定要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们要尽自己的一切力量，以最高的热情、最大的决心、最快的速度，宣传、学习、贯彻、落实毛主席的每一个指示。我们要把注意力放在思想政治工作上，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，占领一切阵地，象“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志那样，“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    程世清同志号召全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，切实办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，破私立公，改造世界观，狠批修正主义，继续深入开展革命大批判，促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好斗批改，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结，加强和巩固无产阶级专政，提高革命警惕性，抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。
    程世清同志最后说，毛主席、林副主席、党中央对江西省无产阶级文化大革命运动给予高度的评价，寄予殷切的期望。我们井冈山儿女一定要“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，奋发图强，永远革命，不断前进，誓作中国革命和世界革命的促进派，把毛主席亲手创建的第一个红色革命根据地办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把毛主席亲自点燃的井冈山火炬燃遍全世界，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想普照全球。
    “支左爱民模范”李文忠同志生前所在连队、六○一一部队某部六连政治指导员纪瑞华，代表江西驻军全体指战员在大会上讲了话。他说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们全体指战员，坚决支持江西省革命委员会。我们永远紧跟毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席，象李文忠同志那样，“生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身。”我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，继续大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，更好地开展四好连队运动，把我军革命化、现代化建设提到一个更高的水平，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，进一步做好爱民工作，坚决贯彻毛主席抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备的伟大指示，加强战备，巩固国防，随时准备粉碎敌人的战争挑衅，在保卫伟大的祖国、保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，为祖国、为人民立新功。
    江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会和工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将的代表，满怀革命豪情在大会上发言，热烈祝贺江西省革命委员会的诞生。他们一致指出，江西省革命委员会的成立，绝不意味着革命结束，而是革命的新起点。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新高潮，学出新水平，用出新水平。我们井冈山儿女坚定不移地表示：天变地变，忠于伟大领袖毛主席和伟大毛泽东思想的红心永不变！地动山摇，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗决不动摇！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想永不丢！对毛主席的指示句句照办，字字照办，永远照办！对伟大领袖无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
    大会在万分热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，通过了给最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    大会还通过了给中国人民解放军江西驻军全体指战员的慰问信。
