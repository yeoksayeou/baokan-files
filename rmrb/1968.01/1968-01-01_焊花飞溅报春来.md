Hang red lanterns and set up colorful banners,
Quickly hang up the giant portrait of Chairman Mao,
The spacious shipyard is the venue,
The blue sky stretches wide as the curtain opens.

New ships stand tall and proud,
Red flags line both sides,
The shipyard is buzzing with excitement,
Good news floods the sky.

A victory celebration on New Year's Day,
People are like mountains, emotions like the sea,
Discussing the limitless prospects of the Cultural Revolution,
Who wouldn't want to step onto the stage and speak?

Victories are endless,
Songs and laughter echo beyond the sky,
The Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown,
The bourgeois headquarters has collapsed!

Standing on the shipyard and looking at the world,
The revolutionary torrent surges like a tidal wave,
"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"
We trample the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries underfoot.

Mountains forever green, waters forever clear,
People around the world love Chairman Mao,
Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the globe,
Shining brightly for generations to come.

"Grasp revolution, promote production,"
Sparks of welding announce the arrival of spring,
We build the giant ship of communism,
Chairman Mao steers the course.

A victory celebration, a battle meeting,
Battle songs echo, expressing our hearts,
Closely following Chairman Mao,
The hammer forges a new world.

    焊花飞溅报春来
    沪东造船厂工人　居有松
    挂红灯啊扎彩牌，
    快把毛主席巨像挂起来，
    宽阔船台是会场啊，
    蓝天万里幕拉开。
    一条条新船高昂首，
    一面面红旗两边排，
    造船厂里人沸腾，
    喜报铺天盖地来。
    元旦开个庆功会，
    人如山啊情似海，
    畅谈文化革命形势无限好，
    谁不想跳上台来摆一摆。
    胜利的战果说不完，
    歌声笑语传天外，
    中国赫鲁晓夫被打倒，
    资产阶级司令部垮了台！
    站在船台看世界，
    革命洪流排山倒海，
    “枪杆子里面出政权”，
    把帝修反脚下踩。
    山常青啊水常绿，
    世界人民无限热爱毛主席，
    毛泽东思想照全球，
    永放光彩红万代。
    “抓革命，促生产”，
    焊花飞溅报春来，
    共产主义巨轮咱们造，
    毛主席掌舵把路开。
    庆功的会啊战斗的会，
    战歌阵阵抒胸怀，
    紧紧跟着毛主席，
    铁锤打出新世界。
