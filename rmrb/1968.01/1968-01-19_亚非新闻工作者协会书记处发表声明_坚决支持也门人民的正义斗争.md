The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association today issued a statement firmly supporting the struggle of the Yemeni people and calling on all Asian-African journalists to fully expose the various plots and tricks of U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys in Yemen and other Arab countries.

The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association has been closely following the developments in the Middle East and condemns the evil plots of U.S. and British imperialism to continue subversive activities and wars of aggression against the Arab people.

The statement pointed out that recently, U.S. and British imperialists have used Saudi Arabia as a base, allowing European mercenaries and royalist elements to infiltrate Yemen to disrupt and sabotage the republican system. The imperialists have also requested assistance from the reactionary regime in Iran, using Iran as a base to air-drop European mercenaries and supply weapons to reactionary forces operating in Yemen.

The statement noted that it is noteworthy that Soviet revisionists have played a shameful role as accomplices in this U.S. imperialist aggression. The Yemeni authorities recently publicly condemned the slanderous reports issued by the Soviet news agency TASS in support of U.S. imperialist evil plots.

The statement praised the Yemeni people and army for their resolute resistance against the aggressors, displaying revolutionary courage in their struggle against imperialism, reactionaries, and their accomplices, and inflicting heavy blows on imperialism, defending the republic, and exposing the plotters.

The statement said that the Secretariat fully supports the just struggle of the Arab people in this important strategic region of the Arab world. The Secretariat reiterates its support for the Yemeni people and calls on all Asian-African journalists to fully expose the various plots and tricks of U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices in Yemen and other Arab countries. The Secretariat calls on all revolutionary journalists to support the Arab people's just struggle for progress, national liberation, and against imperialism and old and new colonialism, to continue supporting the Arab people until the occupied Palestinian territories are completely liberated and imperialism and its lackeys are completely eliminated from the Arab world.

    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处发表声明
    坚决支持也门人民的正义斗争
    新华社十八日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表声明，坚决支持也门人民的斗争，并号召所有亚非新闻工作者全力揭露以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗在也门和其他阿拉伯国家搞的种种阴谋诡计。
    声明说，亚非记协书记处密切注视着中东局势的发展，谴责美英帝国主义继续对阿拉伯人民搞颠覆活动和侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。
    声明指出，近来，美英帝国主义者利用沙特阿拉伯作为基地，让欧洲雇佣军和保皇分子渗透到也门，来干扰和破坏共和制度。帝国主义者还请求伊朗反动当局援助，把伊朗作为基地，空投欧洲雇佣军，供给武器给在也门活动的反动势力。
    声明指出，值得注意的是，苏联修正主义者在美帝这一侵略活动中扮演了可耻的帮凶角色，也门当局最近曾公开谴责苏联国家通讯社——塔斯社所发出的为美帝罪恶阴谋效劳的诬蔑性报道。
    声明赞扬也门人民和军队坚决反抗侵略者，他们在对付帝国主义、反动派及其合谋者的斗争中，显示出了革命的勇气，沉重地打击了帝国主义，保卫了共和国，揭露了阴谋者。
    声明说，书记处全力支持阿拉伯人民在阿拉伯世界这一重要的战略地区进行的正义斗争。书记处重申支持也门人民，并号召所有的亚非新闻工作者全力揭露以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗、合谋者在也门和其他阿拉伯国家搞的种种阴谋诡计。书记处号召所有革命新闻工作者支持阿拉伯人民争取进步、民族解放、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争，继续支持阿拉伯人民，一直到被占领的巴勒斯坦彻底解放和帝国主义及其走狗从阿拉伯世界上消灭干净。
