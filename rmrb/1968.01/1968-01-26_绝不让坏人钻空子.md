	We must not allow bad elements to exploit loopholes
	Shanghai Fourteenth Cotton Textile Mill Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Committee

	The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the great enemy of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must not take it lightly; we must resolutely overthrow it!

	The enemy uses factionalism, and factionalism shields the enemy. Looking back at the long history of "internal strife" in our factory, it fully proves that this is a correct conclusion.

	Our factory originally had two large mass organizations: the Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Headquarters and the United Struggle-Criticism-Transformation Command. Both were subordinate organizations of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Headquarters and should be considered one faction, both being revolutionary factions of the proletariat. However, due to the mischief caused by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, not only did they fail to unite for a long time, but their differences became more severe, and the "internal strife" became more intense, to the point of repeatedly engaging in armed clashes. This situation is very easy for the enemy to exploit. Because the class enemies do not readily accept their defeat, their main means of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution is to use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism of certain people within our ranks to sow discord, causing revolutionary mass organizations to engage in endless "internal strife." When our factory was in the midst of "internal strife," there was a traitor and rightist element who thought the time had come and became very active. He ran around, inciting one faction against another, sometimes speaking ill of one faction's leader to the other faction, and sometimes claiming to attend the other faction's standing committee meetings. This caused the two factions to become even more opposed to each other. It was not until the entire factory achieved revolutionary great unity that we exposed him. Another time, when the two factions were engaged in armed clashes, another bad element emerged. He feared that the situation would not escalate and eagerly ran around, openly inciting the besieged side to rally troops for a "counter-encirclement," attempting to continue the escalation. This bad element was originally a walking capitalist-road element that both factions agreed should be overthrown, but at the time, both sides were only focused on the "internal strife," ignoring him, and he took advantage of our factionalism to exploit the loopholes.

	These living examples have taught us that we must never forget class struggle. Our factionalism has been exploited by class enemies, not only shielding them but also providing them with the conditions to continue their evil deeds. How dangerous this is!

	In light of such serious experiences and lessons, everyone demands that the two organizations must immediately unite and join forces against the enemy to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Last December, a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the factory and brought us the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong. Under the help of the PLA, the two organizations successively held six sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The study classes, with the line of "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism," thoroughly exposed the harm of factionalism and listed the crimes of factionalism, making bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism a target for everyone to criticize. The two revolutionary mass organizations not only achieved organizational great unity but also achieved ideological great unity.

    绝不让坏人钻空子
    上海第十四棉纺织厂工人革命造反委员会
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌，我们决不能等闲视之，一定要坚决把它打倒！
    敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人。翻一翻我们厂长期“内战”的历史，完全证明这是一个正确的结论。
    我厂原来有两个大的群众组织：工人革命造反队总部和联合斗批指挥部。两者都是上海工人革命造反总司令部的下属组织，应该说是一派，都是无产阶级革命派。但是，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，不仅长期联合不起来，而且分歧越来越严重，“内战”越打越激烈，以至一再发生武斗。这种情况很容易被敌人利用。因为阶级敌人决不甘心自己的失败，他们破坏文化大革命的主要手段，就是利用我们队伍中某些人的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进行挑拨离间，使革命群众组织“内战”不休。我们厂里正进行“内战”的时候，就有个叛徒、右派分子，以为时机已到，非常活跃。他上窜下跳，拉一派，打一派，一会儿对这一派头头说另一派的坏话，一会儿又在另一派面前说他自己经常列席对方的常委会议。这样，就使得两派更加对立。直到全厂实现革命大联合以后，才把他揪出来。还有一次，当两派发生武斗的时候，又有一个坏家伙冒了出来。他唯恐天下不乱，起劲地东奔西跑，公然煽动被围的一方去拉队伍进行“反包围”，企图使事态继续扩大。这个坏家伙本来是两派都认为应该打倒的走资派，但当时由于双方只顾打“内战”，把他放在一边不管，他竟利用我们的派性，钻了空子。
    这些活生生的事实教育了我们，千万不能忘记阶级斗争。我们的派性已被阶级敌人所利用，不仅掩护了他们，而且给他们提供了继续作恶的条件，这是多么危险啊！
    鉴于这样严重的经验教训，大家要求，两个组织应该马上联合起来，共同对敌，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。去年十二月，人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队进厂以后，给我们送来了光辉的毛泽东思想。在解放军的帮助下，两个组织先后联合举办了六期毛泽东思想学习班。学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，大摆派性的危害，历数派性的罪状，使资产阶级、小资产阶级派性成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。两个革命群众组织不但实现了组织上的革命大联合，而且实现了思想上的革命大联合。
