The Liberation Army of South Vietnam has launched a powerful offensive south of the demilitarized zone, striking the U.S. military base at Khe Sanh with fierce and accurate artillery fire, annihilating a large number of enemy troops.

HANOI, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) — The armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have launched fierce attacks over the past few days south of the demilitarized zone, causing the U.S. aggressors to suffer heavy losses.

On the 23rd, the Liberation Army continued its third consecutive day of intense artillery bombardment against the U.S. Marine Corps base at Khe Sanh south of the demilitarized zone, killing and wounding a large number of enemy troops. The Liberation Army has cut off the road to Khe Sanh, surrounding the base. The U.S. puppet forces in Khe Sanh, fearing the powerful offensive of the South Vietnamese people, fled the town in disarray on the 22nd and retreated to the U.S. military base.

Khe Sanh is located in a valley near the Laotian border, surrounded by towering mountains and dense forests, providing a highly advantageous position for the Liberation Army's operations.

On the 21st, the Liberation Army launched a fierce artillery bombardment against the enemy base at Khe Sanh. The dense barrage of shells accurately struck the runway of the base's airfield, rendering it unusable. Simultaneously, a batch of enemy aircraft was destroyed. Many U.S. military barracks and an ammunition depot were reduced to rubble, causing a massive fire. Preliminary reports indicate that over a hundred U.S. aggressors were killed or wounded in this bombardment.

On the following day, the Liberation Army conducted five large-scale artillery bombardments and attacks against the enemy base at Khe Sanh, killing and wounding many enemy troops. At the same time, the Liberation Army launched intense artillery barrages against enemy bases along the line from Khe Sanh and Kham Duc in the west to the coastal town of Hue in the east. The Liberation Army also attacked two companies of U.S. Marines near the Kham Duc outpost and a unit of South Vietnamese puppet troops on the coast.

The powerful offensive by the Liberation Army has struck fear into the hearts of the U.S. and puppet forces. The U.S. military command in Vietnam had to withdraw troops from the central battlefield to reinforce the beleaguered U.S. Marines south of the demilitarized zone. The U.S. and puppet forces hastily declared martial law in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region south of the demilitarized zone and banned all boat traffic on small rivers.

HANOI, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) — SAIGON — The armed forces of the people of South Vietnam continued their fourth consecutive day of intense attacks against the U.S. military base at Khe Sanh south of the demilitarized zone, killing and wounding enemy troops in the surrounding dense forests.

Since the 21st, the Liberation Army has surrounded this U.S. base in the mountains near the Laotian border and launched continuous fierce attacks. Simultaneously, the Liberation Army conducted intense artillery barrages against U.S. bases along the line from Khe Sanh and Kham Duc to the coastal town of Hue.

Under the powerful offensive of the Liberation Army, approximately 5,000 U.S. Marines in the Khe Sanh base are terrified and on edge. The U.S. and puppet forces in the nearby town of Quang Tri fled in disarray on the 23rd and retreated to the base. Previously, the U.S. and puppet forces in Khe Sanh and surrounding villages had also fled to the base on the 22nd. The Liberation Army's artillery and sniper fire have now closed in on all sides of the U.S. base.

Currently, the supplies and ammunition of the U.S. forces in the base are entirely dependent on airlifts. The Liberation Army has organized powerful anti-aircraft fire on the surrounding hills, shooting down and damaging many enemy aircraft.

The U.S. military leaders in Vietnam are extremely alarmed by the powerful offensive of the Liberation Army. In recent days, they have withdrawn nearly 10,000 troops from the units stationed in the Da Nang area, including a brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, to reinforce the beleaguered U.S. Marines south of the demilitarized zone. U.S. military leaders and American newspapers have exclaimed that this is another fierce offensive by the Liberation Army following the battles of Lang Vei and Dak To.

According to a report by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the armed forces of the people of My Tho province bravely fought on the 10th, shattering the "sweep" operation by American invaders in the village of Thua Me in Go Cong district. They annihilated two companies of U.S. aggressors, severely damaged another company, shot down four enemy helicopters loaded with troops, damaged one military ship, and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

    南越解放军在非军事区以南发动强大攻势
    以猛烈准确炮火袭击美军溪星基地歼灭大量敌人
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南南方人民解放武装力量这几天来在非军事区以南展开猛烈的攻势，打得美国侵略军狼狈不堪。
    人民解放武装力量二十三日接连第三天对非军事区以南的美国海军陆战队溪星基地进行了猛烈的炮击，杀伤大量的敌人。人民解放武装力量已经切断了通往溪星基地的公路，使这个基地陷在重重包围之中。驻在溪星镇上的美伪军慑于南方军民的强大攻势，已在二十二日狼狈逃出了溪星镇，龟缩到了美军基地中去。
    溪星位于非军事区以南靠近老挝边境的一个山谷里，四周崇山绵延，森林茂密，对人民解放武装力量作战极为有利。
    在这以前，人民解放武装力量在二十一日凌晨对敌人溪星基地进行了猛烈的炮击。密集的炮弹准确地击中了基地内机场的跑道，使敌人的这个机场无法使用。同时，击毁了敌人的一批飞机。许多座美军营房和一座弹药库被炮火摧毁，引起了猛烈的大火。据初步消息，有一百多名美国侵略军在这次炮击中被打死打伤。
    第二天，人民解放武装力量又对敌人溪星基地进行了五次大规模的炮击和袭击，打死打伤很多敌人。同时，人民解放武装力量在非军事区以南从西面的溪星、昆天到东面海边的犹灵一线对敌人的基地连续进行了密集的炮击。人民解放武装力量在昆天据点附近袭击了两连美国海军陆战队，又在海边袭击了南越伪军的一支部队。
    人民解放武装力量的强大攻势，使美伪军胆战心惊。侵越美军司令部不得不从中部战场抽调兵力增援在非军事区以南被打得焦头烂额的美国海军陆战队，美伪军还仓惶宣布，在非军事区以南的广治—承天地区实行戒严，并且禁止船只在所有小河道上通行。
    新华社二十四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民解放武装力量二十四日在非军事区以南战场上，连续第四天紧紧包围美军溪星基地，在四周丛林茂密的山岭上不断地杀伤基地内的美国侵略军。
    人民解放武装力量自二十一日以来，包围了这个在靠近老挝边境的群山中的美军基地，并且连续进行了猛烈的攻击。同时，人民解放武装力量对从溪星、昆天到海边的犹灵一线的美军基地，展开了猛烈的炮击。
    在人民解放武装力量的强大攻势下，溪星基地内大约五千名美国海军陆战队吓得心惊胆战，草木皆兵。驻守在基地附近香化县城内的美伪军已在二十三日仓惶逃出了县城，龟缩到基地中去。在这以前，驻守在溪星镇以及周围村庄里的美伪军也在二十二日逃到了基地中去。人民解放武装力量的炮火和狙击火力已从四面逼近了这个美军基地。
    现在，这个基地内的美军的弹药和给养，全部依靠空运接济。人民解放武装力量在周围山岭上组织了强大的对空火力，击落击伤了许多架敌机。
    侵越美军头目对人民解放武装力量的这一强大攻势非常惊慌，这些天来不得不从驻守岘港地区的部队中抽调了近一万人，其中包括第一骑兵师的一个旅，到非军事区以南去增援被打得焦头烂额的美国海军陆战队。侵越美军头目和美国报刊惊呼，这是人民解放武装力量继禄宁、德都战斗以后的又一次猛烈的攻势。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：美萩省人民解放武装力量十日英勇作战，粉碎了美国强盗对丐?县厚美乡进行的“扫荡”，全歼美国侵略军两个连，重创一个连，击落载满敌军的直升飞机四架，击伤军用船只一艘，缴获许多武器、弹药和军用物资。
