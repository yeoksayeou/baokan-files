The armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have been active in various regions since January 15, attacking towns, bombing airports, raiding camps, and ambushing convoys, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. aggressors.

In the Central Highlands, the armed forces of the people of Kontum Province launched a fierce artillery barrage on a U.S. Special Forces camp in the Dak To area on January 15, attacking four times in succession. The American aggressors suffered heavy losses. This was another heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors following the people's armed forces' major victory of annihilating 3,500 enemy troops in the Dak To area last November. Western news agencies expressed concern, fearing that this might be the prelude to a new large-scale offensive by the people's armed forces in the region, and worrying that the U.S. aggressors would suffer even more devastating defeats. On the same day, the armed forces of this province also ambushed a U.S. military transport convoy south of Dak To. According to obviously understated figures from Western news agencies, several U.S. tanks were destroyed and thirteen U.S. soldiers were injured in this ambush.

On January 20, the armed forces of Kontum Province, building on their victory, launched a fierce attack on the U.S. command headquarters in Pleiku and the Pleiku Airport, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy once again.

In the area near the demilitarized zone, the armed forces of the people of Quang Tri Province also fought brilliantly. On January 18, a unit of U.S. Marine invaders was "sweeping" near Cam Lo when they were attacked by local military and civilians, suffering heavy casualties. The enemy hastily sent another company to rescue them, but they were also beaten back by the people's armed forces. During the battle, the military and civilians of Quang Tri Province charged forward, engaging in close combat with the American aggressors, rendering the enemy's aircraft and artillery useless. On January 20, the military and civilians of this province engaged in fierce combat with the U.S. Marines nine kilometers east of Khe Sanh, annihilating thirty American aggressors.

The armed forces of the people of the Mekong Delta in Chau Doc Province swiftly captured the provincial capital of Chau Doc on January 17, annihilating many enemy troops. On January 20, the armed forces of the people of Gia Dinh Province launched a fierce attack on a camp of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division near Go Cong, killing and wounding more than fifty American aggressors.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on January 18, the armed forces of the people of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam, following their annihilation of 1,600 enemy troops in the Que Son area at the beginning of the year, achieved another great victory in this area on January 5 and 8, annihilating nearly four companies of U.S. troops.

The report said that on January 8, the armed forces of Quang Nam Province ambushed a camp of the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade in the Phu Loc area of Que Son County, annihilating many U.S. aggressors, with the remaining enemy fleeing in all directions. That afternoon at 2:00 PM, a company of U.S. aggressors heading towards the Truong Son area along Highway 16 was also subjected to a fierce ambush by the people's armed forces and was completely annihilated.

    新华社二十日讯　西贡消息：越南南方人民解放武装力量，十五日以来驰骋各地，攻市镇，炸机场，袭营地，截车队，给美国侵略者以重大杀伤。
    中部高原的昆嵩省人民解放武装力量十五日对德都地区一个美军特种部队营地，以猛烈的炮火连续发动四次进攻，杀得美国强盗死伤累累。这是人民解放武装力量继去年十一月在德都地区取得歼敌三千五百名的巨大战功以后给美国侵略者的又一次沉重打击。西方通讯社忧心忡忡地惊呼，这可能是人民解放武装力量“在这个地区发动新的大规模攻势的前奏”，担心美国侵略者将遭到更加惨重的失败。同一天，这个省的人民解放武装力量在德都以南地区还截击一支美军运输车队。根据西方通讯社显然缩小了的数字透露，在这次截击战中，“有好几辆美国坦克遭到破坏，十三个美国兵受伤”。
    二十日，昆嵩省人民解放武装力量乘胜前进，又猛烈袭击驻在波来古的美军司令部和波来古机场，使敌人再次遭受重大损失。
    在非军事区附近，广治省人民解放武装力量打得也非常出色。十八日，一支美国海军陆战队的侵略军在昆天附近进行“扫荡”时，遭到当地军民的袭击，死伤枕藉。敌人慌忙出动另一连敌人前去救援，同样被人民解放武装力量打得晕头转向。在战斗中，广治省军民冲上前去，同美国强盗展开了近战，以至使敌人的飞机、大炮完全失去作用。这个省的军民二十日在犹灵以东九公里的地方，同美国海军陆战队又发生了激烈战斗，一举歼灭美国强盗三十名。
    战斗在湄公河三角洲的茶荣省人民解放武装力量，十七日以迅雷不及掩耳之势攻克了省会茶荣市，歼灭许多敌人。二十日，嘉定省人民解放武装力量，对驻在古芝县附近的美国第二十五步兵师的一个营地发动猛烈袭击，打死打伤美国强盗五十多名。
    据新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省人民解放武装力量，继年初在桂山地区歼敌一千六百名以后，五日和八日，经过英勇奋战，又在这个地区取得歼灭美军近四个连的巨大胜利。
    报道说，广南省人民解放武装力量，八日在桂山县富禄地区截击美国一九六轻步兵旅的一个营，消灭许多美国侵略军，残敌四处逃命。当天下午二时，一连美国侵略军沿着第十六号公路开往锦秀地区，又遭到人民解放武装力量的猛烈截击，被全部歼灭。
