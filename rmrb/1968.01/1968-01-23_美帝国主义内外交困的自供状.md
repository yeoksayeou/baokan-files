The head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, recently delivered his annual State of the Union address. This address was low in tone, lackluster, evasive, and deceitful. It exposed, despite attempts to cover it up, the predicament of U.S. imperialism, which is beset with internal and external difficulties and at a loss for solutions, under the impact of the revolutionary storms of the world's people.

Johnson's State of the Union address was made at a time when the situation of U.S. imperialism was worse than ever. The development of the world situation is increasingly unfavorable to U.S. imperialism. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world have greatly inspired and promoted the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation has achieved brilliant victories, inflicting heavy defeats on U.S. imperialism. The flames of revolutionary armed struggles are burning more fiercely in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The proletariat and working people of North America, Western Europe, and Oceania are becoming more and more awakened. The revolutionary situation in the world is getting better and better, while imperialism, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries are increasingly heading towards a dead end. The contradictions among imperialist countries are intensifying. The entire capitalist world is in a state of great turmoil and chaos. It is this situation that forced Johnson to cry out in alarm in his State of the Union address: "Our country is facing challenges both domestically and internationally."

However, the U.S. ruling class does not dare to face up to these "challenges." In his State of the Union address, Johnson deliberately avoided the unfavorable factors in the international situation for U.S. imperialism and tried to cover up the setbacks and difficulties of U.S. imperialism in every possible way. He had to mention the Vietnam issue, which is most troublesome to him, but he shamelessly covered up the well-known defeats of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam and its desperate and humiliating situation in the quagmire of defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam. He did not dare to mention the boiling revolutionary struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and put away the usual boast of "guiding" the "tide of change" in that region. The so-called "unity" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the "prosperity" of the "free world" that Johnson and his ilk have always boasted about have disappeared from his address. The devaluation of the pound, Britain's decision to withdraw troops from east of the Suez earlier, France's proposal of its own "new strategy," and other events seem to have never happened. Johnson's attitude of concealment reflects that the strength of U.S. imperialism has further weakened, and its hegemonic position in the capitalist world is increasingly shaken; it reflects that U.S. imperialism is facing a pile of problems and is at a loss.

Domestically, the U.S. ruling class is also having a hard time. Johnson's State of the Union address exposed the unprecedented sharpness of social contradictions in the United States. Despite his shameless boasting of his so-called "achievements," Johnson had to admit that "some clouds are appearing on the economic horizon," prices are rising rapidly, unemployment is increasing, and class contradictions are intensifying. He no longer dares to tout his "great society" slogan. No matter how hollowly Johnson talks about the "will" and "capability" of U.S. imperialism, it cannot cover up the fact that the U.S. ruling class has no magic pill to cure the political and economic crisis of the United States, which is in its death throes, and can only continue to slide downhill.

However, all reactionary forces will never admit their failure. Johnson's address shows that U.S. imperialism will still make desperate struggles to save its doomed fate.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "Just as we often estimate the situation of the balance of forces in the class struggle at home and abroad, our enemies also often estimate this situation. But our enemies are the backward, rotten, and reactionary forces who are doomed to perish. They do not understand the laws of the objective world. The methods they use to think are subjective and metaphysical, so their estimates are always wrong."

In his State of the Union address, Johnson's analysis of the situation and his probing of the direction led him to believe that the current internal and external difficulties of the United States are because the "big ship" of U.S. imperialism is "sailing through new waters," and the difficulties it faces are merely the "stirring" and "waves" of the sea water. This is all self-deception. In fact, the wrecked ship of U.S. imperialism is already experiencing violent tossing in the face of the revolutionary storms of the world's people. To prevent its capsizing, the only way Johnson can find is to strengthen the use of counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics. On the one hand, Johnson cries out to maintain military strength for aggression, increase military spending, and proposes an unprecedentedly huge budget of 185 billion dollars; on the other hand, he expresses the need to expedite the use of the "International Development Association," the "Asian Development Bank," the "Food for Freedom Program," and other means to support so-called "peaceful changes." On the Vietnam issue, he on the one hand rants that the United States is "determined to persist," and on the other hand expresses the intention to continue playing the "peace talks" trick. This means that U.S. imperialism still tries to use the tricks of "forcing peace through war" and "stopping bombing to lure peace" to achieve the goal of staying in South Vietnam for a long time. Domestically, Johnson on the one hand emphasizes the need to increase taxes and further intensify the exploitation of the broad masses of the American people, and on the other hand lists a bunch of blank checks in flowery language to deceive people; on the one hand, he announces the need to train reactionary police, increase secret agents, and expand the "ability to deal with riots in a timely manner" to strengthen the suppression of the American people, especially the American blacks, and on the other hand, continues to advocate so-called "civil rights bills" to win hearts and minds. This shows that the Johnson government has reached the point of being at a loss.

Johnson believes that to make his counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics succeed, he must rely on a main "friend," that is, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique that betrays the interests of the world's people; he must oppose a main enemy, that is, the Chinese people who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world. In his State of the Union address, Johnson lavishly praised his talks with Kosygin in Glassboro and the many "important steps" of the intensified collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, especially boasting with great satisfaction about how he used the "hotline" between Washington and Moscow for the first time in history during the Middle East incident last year to collude with the Soviet revisionist clique to sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people. At the same time, he fiercely attacks socialist China and maliciously slanders China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This nakedly exposes the despicable plot of U.S. imperialism to collude with the Soviet revisionist clique to be anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people, and further proves that the Soviet revisionist clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and a traitor to the revolutionary people of the world.

The law of social development is not subject to the will of people. The counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics of U.S. imperialism and the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist clique have not been able to save the failure of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, and in the future, they will not be able to stop the decline of this number one imperialism. The year 1968 will be a very difficult year for U.S. imperialism. Johnson's State of the Union address is a helpless confession of this situation. Facts will prove that in the face of the strengthening of the struggle against U.S. imperialism by the revolutionary people of the world, all the desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism will be in vain and will only accelerate its own comprehensive collapse and ultimate doom.

    美帝国主义内外交困的自供状
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊最近发表了他一年一度的国情咨文。这个国情咨文，调子低沉，无精打采，避实就虚，藏头露尾。它欲盖弥彰地暴露了美帝国主义在世界人民革命风暴冲击下内外交困、束手无策的窘态。
    约翰逊的这个国情咨文是在美帝国主义处境空前不妙的情况下提出来的。世界形势的发展对美帝国主义越来越不利。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，有力地鼓舞和推动着全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。越南人民的抗美救国战争取得光辉胜利，把美帝国主义打得狼狈不堪。革命武装斗争的烽火在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲越烧越烈。北美、西欧和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民日益觉醒。全世界的革命形势越来越好，而帝国主义、苏修集团和各国反动派却越来越走上穷途末路。帝国主义国家之间的矛盾日益加剧。整个资本主义世界陷于绝大的动荡和混乱之中。正是这种形势，迫使约翰逊在国情咨文中惊恐地叫嚷：“我们国家在国内外都受到了挑战”。
    然而，美国统治集团却不敢正视这种“挑战”。约翰逊在国情咨文中，竭力回避国际形势对美帝国主义不利的因素，百般掩饰美帝国主义的挫折和困难。他不得不谈到使他最为头痛的越南问题，但却厚着脸皮遮掩美帝国主义在侵越战争中人所共知的败绩，遮掩它在侵越战争失败的泥潭中走投无路的狼狈处境。他绝口不敢提及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲沸腾的人民革命斗争，把过去惯于吹嘘的什么要“引导”这个地区的“变革的潮流”的大话也收起来了。约翰逊之流一向标榜的所谓北大西洋集团的“团结”、“自由世界”的“繁荣”，在他的这个咨文中已经失去了踪影。英镑贬值，英国决定提前从苏伊士以东撤军，法国提出自己的“新战略”等事情，好象根本没有发生过。约翰逊这种讳莫如深的态度，恰恰反映了美帝国主义的力量已经进一步削弱，它在资本主义世界中的霸主地位也日益动摇；反映了美帝国主义面对着一大堆难题，一筹莫展。
    在美国国内，美国统治集团的日子也很不好过。约翰逊的国情咨文暴露了美国社会矛盾的空前尖锐。约翰逊尽管大言不惭地吹嘘他的所谓“成就”，但是不得不承认美国经济的“地平线上出现一些乌云”，“物价加速盘旋上涨”，失业激增，阶级矛盾加剧。他已经不敢再抬出他的什么“伟大的社会”的破烂招牌了。不管约翰逊怎样空空洞洞地大谈美帝国主义的“意志”和“能力”，都掩饰不了这样的事实：美国统治集团拿不出任何可以医治病入膏肓的美国政治经济危机的灵丹妙方，只能顺着下坡路继续滑落下去。
    但是，一切反动势力都是绝对不会甘心承认自己的失败的。约翰逊的咨文表明，美帝国主义仍然要进行绝望的挣扎，妄图挽救它注定灭亡的命运。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经指出，“如同我们经常在估计国际国内阶级斗争力量对比的形势一样，敌人也在经常估计这种形势。但我们的敌人是落后的腐朽的反动派，他们是注定要灭亡的，他们不懂得客观世界的规律，他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。”
    约翰逊在国情咨文里分析形势、窥测方向的结果，认为美国目前内外交困的处境，是因为美帝国主义的“大船”正在“通过新的海域”，它所面对的困难，不过是海水的“被搅动”和“起波浪”。这完全是自欺欺人的鬼话。事实上，美帝国主义这只破船，在世界人民革命的风暴面前已经发生剧烈颠簸。为了避免它的覆没，约翰逊所能找到的唯一办法是：加强使用反革命的两手策略。约翰逊一方面叫嚷要保持能够进行侵略的军事力量，增加军事开支，提出高达一千八百五十亿美元的空前庞大的预算；另一方面表示要加紧利用“国际开发协会”、“亚洲开发银行”、“粮食用于自由计划”等手段，来支持所谓“和平的改变”。在越南问题上，他一方面叫嚣美国“决心坚持下去”，另一方面表示要继续玩弄“和谈”骗局。这就是说，美帝国主义仍然妄图用“以战迫和”和“停炸诱和”的伎俩，来达到长期赖在越南南方的目的。在国内，约翰逊一方面强调要增加捐税，进一步加紧对广大美国人民的榨取，另一方面天花乱坠地开列一大堆空头支票来进行欺骗；一方面宣布要加紧训练反动警察、增加特务，扩大“及时对付骚乱的能力”，来加强对美国人民，特别是对美国黑人的镇压，另一方面继续鼓吹所谓“各项民权法案”来笼络人心。这说明约翰逊政府已到了黔驴技穷的地步了。
    约翰逊认为，要使他的反革命两手策略能够得逞，必须依靠一个主要的“朋友”，这就是出卖世界人民利益的苏修叛徒集团；必须反对一个主要的敌人，这就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、全心全意支援世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民反帝革命斗争的中国人民。约翰逊在国情咨文里，大肆宣扬他同柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会谈和美苏加紧勾结的许多“重要步骤”，特别满心得意地夸耀他去年在中东事件中怎样同苏修集团“历史上第一次使用了华盛顿和莫斯科之间的热线”，互相串通破坏阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。同时他又疯狂地攻击社会主义中国，恶毒地污蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义加紧勾结苏修集团反华、反共、反人民的卑鄙阴谋，也进一步证明了苏修集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是叛卖全世界革命人民的无耻叛徒。
    社会发展的规律是不以人们的意志为转移的。美帝国主义的反革命的两手策略和苏修集团的叛卖行径，过去没有能够挽救美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的失败，今后也阻止不了这个头号帝国主义的江河日下。一九六八年对于美帝国主义是一个十分难混的年头，约翰逊的国情咨文就是对于这种形势的一纸无可奈何的供状。事实将要证明，在加强反对美帝国主义的斗争的全世界革命人民面前，美帝国主义的一切疯狂挣扎都将无济于事，而只能加速它自己的全面崩溃和彻底灭亡。
