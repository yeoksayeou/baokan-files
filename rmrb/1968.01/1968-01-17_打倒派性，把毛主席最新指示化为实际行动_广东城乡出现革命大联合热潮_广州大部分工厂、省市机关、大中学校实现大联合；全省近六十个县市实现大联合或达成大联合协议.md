A wave of learning, propagating, applying, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag*, and *Liberation Army Daily* is sweeping across Guangdong Province. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people are earnestly overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and making the tide of revolutionary great unity surge forward.

The Guangdong Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, various military sub-districts, and many revolutionary mass organizations have all, with the most resolute attitude, the highest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the most effective measures, vigorously implemented and comprehensively carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and responsible comrades of various military sub-districts have all gone deep into the grassroots units, together with the revolutionary masses, repeatedly studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Various revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses have also examined the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their own units, affirming achievements, checking shortcomings, finding gaps, formulating measures, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The broad masses of soldiers and cadres of the People's Liberation Army, who are carrying out the "three supports and two military" tasks, and the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, have gone deep into factories, rural areas, schools, streets, fields, and fishing boats, widely propagating the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the broad revolutionary mass organizations have always regarded holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the most important measure for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, in just three months, the province has held more than 14,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 2.8 million revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres participating in the study. The broad revolutionary masses, in the study classes, with "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie" as the key link, carried out serious criticism and self-criticism, exposed the "private" character, overthrew bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and established the "public" character. They carried forward the revolutionary academic style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao, learning and applying what they have learned, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their actions, promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great unity.

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group regards the return of the two factions' representatives who studied at the Beijing Mao Zedong Thought Study Class as a good opportunity to learn, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, letting the reporting team bring Chairman Mao's voice, the battle command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary academic style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao, and the experience of the reporting team's comrades in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the 40 million people of the province, promoting revolutionary great unity and driving the struggle-criticism-transformation of various units.

Now, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people in Guangdong Province. The broad revolutionary masses have recognized that whether or not to achieve revolutionary great unity is a matter of whether or not to listen to Chairman Mao's words. At present, a new high tide of revolutionary great unity has emerged in the cities and countryside of the province. More than 80-90% of the large and medium-sized factories in Guangzhou have achieved revolutionary great unity; the two factions of the provincial and municipal organs in the industrial and commercial, financial and commercial, agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy, party and group, and united front fronts have also achieved revolutionary great unity; the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee has been established in universities, and most colleges and universities have achieved great unity by class and resumed classes to make revolution, primary schools have fully resumed classes, and most middle schools have also achieved revolutionary great unity. Nearly 60 counties and cities in the province have achieved revolutionary great unity or reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary great unity between the two factions, and some special districts and counties have established preparatory groups for revolutionary committees.

    打倒派性，把毛主席最新指示化为实际行动
    广东城乡出现革命大联合热潮
    广州大部分工厂、省市机关、大中学校实现大联合；全省近六十个县市实现大联合或达成大联合协议
    据新华社广州十五日电　一个学习、宣传、运用、落实毛主席最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论的热潮，正席卷广东全省。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使革命大联合的潮流一泻千里，奔腾向前。
    广东省革命委员会筹备小组、各军分区和许多革命群众组织，都以最坚决的态度、最高的热情、最快的速度和最有效的措施，大力贯彻和全面落实毛主席的最新指示。省革筹小组成员和各军分区负责人都深入基层单位，同革命群众一起，反复学习、深刻领会毛主席的最新指示。各革命群众组织和广大革命群众也纷纷检查本单位贯彻和落实毛主席最新指示的情况，肯定成绩，检查缺点，找出差距，制定措施，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。担负
  “三支”“两军”任务的解放军广大指战员和毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、学校、街道、田头和渔船，广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示和元旦社论的精神，使毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，深入人心。
    省革筹小组和广大革命群众组织，一直把大办毛泽东思想学习班，当作活学活用毛主席著作、落实毛主席最新指示的一项最重要措施。在人民解放军的帮助下，短短的三个月内，全省已经举办了一万四千多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的革命工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和革命干部达二百八十多万人。广大革命群众，在学习班里，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进行认真的批评和自我批评，搞臭“私”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大立“公”字。他们发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，学了就用，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，把毛主席的最新指示化为自己的行动，促进、巩固了革命的大联合。
    省革筹小组把广东省在北京毛泽东思想学习班学习的两派代表回省汇报，作为学习、宣传、落实毛主席最新指示的大好机会，让汇报团把毛主席的声音，把以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗命令，把毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，以及汇报团的同志们斗私批修、落实毛主席最新指示的经验，带给全省四千万人民，促进革命的大联合，推动各单位的斗批改。
    现在，毛主席的最新指示在广东省已经深入人心。广大革命群众认识到，愿不愿意实现革命大联合，就是听不听毛主席的话的问题。目前，全省城乡的革命大联合出现了新的高潮。广州市的大、中型工厂已经有百分之八九十实现了革命大联合；省市机关的工交、财贸、农林水利、党群、统战等战线的两派群众组织也实现了革命大联合；大专学校红代会已经成立，大部分高等院校已经实现按班级的大联合和复课闹革命，小学已经全面复课，大部分中学也实现了革命大联合。全省已有近六十个县、市，两大派群众组织实现了革命大联合或达成了实现革命大联合的协议，一些专、县还建立了革命委员会的筹备小组。
