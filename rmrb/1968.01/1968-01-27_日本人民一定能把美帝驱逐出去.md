The winds and thunder roar, and the seas and mountains bellow. A new anti-American storm is sweeping across the Japanese archipelago.

On January 19, the American nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" intruded into the port of Sasebo, Japan. This act of aggression has aroused the extreme indignation of the Japanese people. From Kyushu to Hokkaido, from cities to villages, the broad masses of the people, despite the armed suppression by the reactionary police, held massive demonstrations to oppose the entry of American nuclear ships into Japan and to protest against the new crimes of the Sato government in serving the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam. Under the fierce blows of the powerful anti-American storm of the Japanese people, the "Enterprise" had to slink away from Sasebo with its tail between its legs. This victory in the anti-American patriotic struggle fully demonstrates the Japanese people's revolutionary spirit of fearlessness in the face of tyranny.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long."

The contradiction between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism is irreconcilable. For the sake of national independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the Japanese people have long been waging a relentless and magnificent struggle against U.S. imperialism. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese nation have written brilliant pages in the history of the world people's anti-American struggle with their blood and lives. People will never forget the massive struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" launched by the Japanese people in 1960. This unprecedented anti-American patriotic struggle drove the Kishi government from power and forced U.S. President Eisenhower to cancel his "visit to Japan" plan. People will also not forget the thrilling struggles waged by the Japanese people in recent years to oppose the "Japan-South Korea talks," demand the immediate return of Okinawa, withdraw American military bases, and abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," as well as to oppose the docking of American nuclear submarines in Japanese ports. People will also not forget that in the past year, the Japanese people held one struggle after another to support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, defend Sino-Japanese friendship, and oppose Sato's evil activities in the United States, Taiwan, and South Vietnam. In these struggles, the Japanese people have shown a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, providing great support and encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

The intrusion of the American nuclear aircraft carrier into a Japanese port is also a serious crime of the Sato reactionary government in colluding with U.S. imperialism. Since coming to power, the Sato reactionary government has been wholeheartedly serving as a lackey and running dog of U.S. imperialism. It has actively revived militarism, desperately tried to forge an anti-China encirclement, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, dreaming of reviving the old "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." At the same time, it has intensified the suppression of the Japanese people's anti-American struggle. Last October, the Sato government deployed hundreds of armored vehicles and thousands of police to suppress demonstrating young students at Tokyo Airport. This time, it dispatched thousands of armed police to brutally attack the crowds demonstrating against America. The Sato clique thought that by doing so, they could extinguish the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people. However, the anti-American fury of the Japanese people is forever extinguishable. Isn't the fact that a large-scale anti-American storm has swept across the entire country of Japan just three months after the Sato government's bloody suppression of the demonstrating young students at Tokyo Airport the most powerful proof?

In the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, the revisionist group of Miyamoto has played a shameful role. This bunch of traitors, on the one hand, advocates so-called "legal" struggle, sets traps, and imposes frameworks, attempting to tie the hands of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle; on the other hand, they have taken to the streets, using every means to help the Sato government obstruct and suppress the people's anti-American demonstrations, acting as the lackeys of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. However, the counter-revolutionary activities of the Miyamoto revisionist group not only cannot stop the surging tide of the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people but also have exposed their despicable traitorous faces. More and more members of the Japanese Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) have resolutely broken with the Miyamoto revisionist group and reestablished the left-wing organization of the Japanese Communist Party with Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology; more and more Japanese people have seen through the counter-revolutionary face of the Miyamoto revisionist group and united to fight under the banner of the left-wing organization of the Japanese Communist Party.

Chairman Mao said: "Although the road of struggle is tortuous, the future of the Japanese people is bright. ... The final victory belongs to the people."

Japan belongs to the great Japanese people. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese people will certainly achieve the final victory!

### 日本人民一定能把美帝驱逐出去

    日本人民一定能把美帝驱逐出去
    山岩
    风雷激荡，海啸山吼。日本列岛卷起新的反美风暴。
    一月十九日，美国核航空母舰“企业号”闯进日本佐世保港口。这一侵略行径，激起了日本人民的无比愤怒。从九州到北海道，从城市到乡村，广大人民群众，不顾反动警察的武装镇压，举行了规模宏大的示威游行，反对美核舰进驻日本，抗议佐藤政府为美帝侵越战争效劳的新罪行。在日本人民强大的反美风暴的猛烈打击下，“企业号”不得不夹着尾巴灰溜溜地提前滚出佐世保。这一反美爱国斗争的胜利，充分显示了日本人民不畏强暴的革命精神。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”
    日本人民同美帝国主义的矛盾是不可调和的。为了争取祖国的独立、民主、和平和中立，日本人民长期以来进行了前赴后继、波澜壮阔的反对美帝国主义的斗争。日本民族的优秀儿女，用他们的鲜血和生命，在世界人民反美斗争的历史上写下了光辉灿烂的篇章。人们永远不会忘记一九六○年日本人民展开的声势浩大的反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。这一规模空前的反美爱国斗争，把岸信介政府赶下了台，迫使美国总统艾森豪威尔取消了“访日”计划。人们也不会忘记最近几年来日本人民为反对“日韩会谈”、要求立即归还冲绳、撤除美国军事基地和废除日美“安全条约”，以及反对美国核潜艇停泊日本港口而进行的惊心动魄的斗争。人们也不会忘记，在过去的一年里，日本人民举行了一次又一次气势磅礴的斗争，支援越南人民抗美救国战争，保卫日中友好，反对佐藤到美国、台湾和南越等地进行罪恶活动。日本人民在这些斗争中，表现了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命气概，给予世界各国人民的革命斗争以巨大的支持和鼓舞。
    美国核航空母舰闯进日本港口，也是佐藤反动政府勾结美帝国主义的严重罪行。佐藤反动政府上台以来，一直死心塌地充当美帝国主义的帮凶和走狗。它积极复活军国主义，极力拼凑反华包围圈，大干反革命勾当，做着重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。同时，它加紧对日本人民反美斗争进行镇压。去年十月，佐藤政府出动几百辆装甲车和上千名警察，在东京机场镇压示威青年学生。这一次又派出数千名武装警察对进行反美示威的群众大打出手。佐藤之流满以为这样就可以扑灭日本人民的反美斗争。但是，日本人民的反美怒火是永远扑灭不了的。在佐藤政府血腥镇压在东京机场示威的青年学生之后，仅仅过了三个多月，日本全国又兴起了大规模的反美风暴，不就是最有力的证明吗？
    在日本人民的反美爱国斗争中，宫本修正主义集团扮演了一个可耻的角色。这伙叛徒，一面鼓吹所谓“合法”斗争，设圈套，定框框，妄图捆绑日本人民的反美爱国斗争的手脚；一面又赤膊上阵，千方百计帮助佐藤政府阻挠和镇压人民群众的反美示威，充当了美日反动派的帮凶。但是，宫本修正主义集团的反革命活动，不仅丝毫不能阻挡日本人民革命斗争的滚滚浪潮，反而赤裸裸地暴露了他们可憎的叛徒嘴脸。越来越多的日共马列主义者，坚决与宫本修正主义集团决裂，重新建立以毛泽东思想为指导思想的日共左派组织；越来越多的日本人民，更加看清了宫本修正主义集团反革命的面目，团结战斗在日共左派组织周围。
    毛主席说：“尽管斗争道路是曲折的，但是日本人民的前途是光明的。……最后的胜利属于人民。”
    日本是属于伟大的日本人民的。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，日本人民一定能够取得最后的胜利！
