Currently, in our region, the economic front is as vibrant as the political front. Industry is booming, agriculture is enjoying a bumper harvest, and the market is bustling. Our broad revolutionary masses of workers are, with redoubled efforts, seizing the revolution and promoting production, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, amidst this excellent situation, some evil elements and social dregs have become active. Some speculators are colluding with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside, taking advantage of the busy market season to engage in hoarding, profiteering, illegal long-distance trading, and other speculative activities. They disrupt market order and refuse to comply with market management personnel. Some even deliberately spread rumors and create a tense atmosphere. This is a blatant attempt by class enemies to sabotage socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We cannot ignore this; we must mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to strike back fiercely. In our area, we have already begun to do this and have achieved initial success.

We proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must remain vigilant and resolutely strike down speculators. We must not allow this evil wind to rise!

    决不允许这股妖风刮起来
    目前，我们地区的经济战线和政治战线一样，也是一片大好形势。工业上升，农业全面丰收，市场非常活跃。我们广大革命职工，正以加倍的干劲，抓革命，促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。但是，在这大好形势下，一些牛鬼蛇神和社会渣滓又活动起来了。有些投机商人勾结农村中的地、富、反、坏分子，趁着市场旺季，进行套购、抢购、非法长途贩卖等投机倒把活动。他们捣乱市场秩序，不服从市场管理人员的管理。有的人还故意造谣生事，制造紧张空气。这是阶级敌人明目张胆地破坏社会主义建设，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们决不能等闲视之，必须广泛发动广大革命群众，予以迎头痛击。在我们这里已经开始这样做，并且已取得初步成绩。
    我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要提高警惕，坚决打击投机倒把分子，决不允许这股妖风刮起来！
