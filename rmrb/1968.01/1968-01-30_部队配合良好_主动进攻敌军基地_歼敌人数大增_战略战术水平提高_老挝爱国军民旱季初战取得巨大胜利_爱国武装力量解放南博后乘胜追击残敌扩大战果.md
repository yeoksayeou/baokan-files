	KANHOK, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a press conference in Sam Neua on January 21, where a spokesman introduced the great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilians in the first two and a half months of the dry season (from last November to mid-January this year). The spokesman said that the great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilians in the early dry season have the following characteristics:

	First, the enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower. In the previous dry season of seven months, the Lao patriotic military and civilians annihilated 5,534 enemy troops and seized 1,418 weapons. In the first two and a half months of this dry season, the patriotic armed forces annihilated 4,047 enemy troops and seized 1,450 weapons. Second, the number of enemy units completely annihilated has increased significantly. In the previous dry season, the Lao patriotic military and civilians annihilated only one entire platoon of enemy troops in a single battle, or at most one entire company. In this dry season, four enemy battalions and seven companies have been completely annihilated. In Nam Bao alone, the patriotic armed forces annihilated two enemy battalions in one week. Third, the patriotic armed forces have repeatedly attacked the enemy's bases that launched nibbling attacks on the liberated areas, including fierce attacks on two enemy regimental headquarters and seven battalion headquarters, as well as the airports in Nam Bao and Luang Prabang. Fourth, the coordination between various regions, regular forces, local forces, and guerrilla units, and between various units has improved significantly. In particular, local forces and guerrilla units have developed and grown rapidly, effectively defending the liberated areas and thwarting the enemy's various nibbling attacks, large and small. The strategic and tactical level of the regular army has also greatly improved. The Lao patriotic military and civilians have recovered many strategic areas that were nibbled away by the enemy, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and their puppets' plot to expand the war in Laos.

	The spokesman strongly condemned the U.S. and its lackeys' plot to expand the aggression against Laos. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism has intensified its bombing of the Lao liberated areas. At the same time, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have strengthened their nibbling attacks and sabotage activities against the liberated areas, transported a large number of weapons and military personnel to Laos, and are building strategic roads on Lao territory along the Thai-Lao border. They are also planning to build an electronic "barrier zone" on Lao territory. He called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to press forward and achieve greater victories, defeating the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand the aggressive war.

	KANHOK, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- According to the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Lao patriotic armed forces, after liberating the Nam Bao area and annihilating more than 1,200 enemy troops, closely pursued the fleeing enemy remnants. From January 17 to 19, another 603 enemy troops were captured or surrendered to the patriotic armed forces. Under the strong offensive of the patriotic armed forces, the enemy in the Nam Bao area, apart from being annihilated in large numbers, fled into the jungle. The patriotic armed forces, riding on the victory, closely pursued and searched for the enemy remnants, expanding their victories.

	According to another report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Lao patriotic armed forces, in pursuing the enemy remnants in the southwestern region of Nam Bao, annihilated another 150 enemy troops on January 20, most of whom were captured or surrendered. By January 20, the patriotic armed forces had annihilated approximately 2,000 enemy troops in the Nam Bao area.

    部队配合良好　主动进攻敌军基地　歼敌人数大增　战略战术水平提高
    老挝爱国军民旱季初战取得巨大胜利
    爱国武装力量解放南博后乘胜追击残敌扩大战果
    新华社康开二十六日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人一月二十一日在桑怒举行记者招待会，介绍了老挝爱国军民在旱季战斗头两个半月（去年十一月到今年一月中旬）内取得的巨大胜利。发言人说，老挝爱国军民在这个旱季初期所取得的巨大胜利有以下几个特点：
    一、敌军在人力上遭受了严重损失。上一个旱季的七个月里，老挝爱国军民歼灭敌军五千五百三十四人，缴获武器一千四百十八件，而在这个旱季的头两个半月中，爱国武装力量就歼灭敌军四千零四十七人，缴获武器一千四百五十件。二、遭到全歼的敌军建制单位也大量增加。上一个旱季中，老挝爱国军民在一次战斗中只歼灭一个整排的敌军，或者最多歼灭一个整连的敌军。在这个旱季，已经全歼敌军四个营和七个连。仅在南博一地，爱国武装力量一周内就歼灭了敌军两个营。三、爱国武装力量多次袭击了敌人对解放区发动蚕食进攻的基地，包括猛烈袭击敌军两个团司令部和七个营司令部以及南博和琅勃拉邦的机场。四、各地区之间，正规部队、地方部队和游击队之间，各个部队之间配合得更好。特别是地方部队和游击队发展壮大得很快，有效地保卫了解放区，粉碎了敌军各次大小的蚕食袭击，正规军的战略战术水平也大大提高。老挝爱国军民收复了许多被敌人蚕食的战略地区，使美帝国主义及其仆从扩大老挝战争的阴谋受到沉重的打击。
    发言人严厉谴责美国及其走狗扩大侵略老挝战争的阴谋。他指出，美帝国主义加紧了对老挝解放区的轰炸。同时，美帝国主义及其走狗加强了对解放区进行的蚕食进攻和破坏活动，向老挝运进了大量武器和军事人员，在泰老边境的老挝领土修建战略公路，并且正计划在老挝领土上修建一条电子“障碍地带”。他号召老挝爱国军民乘胜前进，争取更大的胜利，打败美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    据新华社康开二十六日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国武装力量在解放南博地区，歼敌一千二百多名以后，紧紧追击逃窜的敌军残部。从十七日到十九日三天内，又有六百零三名敌人被俘或向爱国武装力量投诚。在爱国武装力量的强大攻势下，南博地区的敌军除大量被歼外，其他的都溃散逃入丛林。爱国武装力量乘胜前进，紧紧追击和搜索残敌，扩大战果。
    另据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国武装力量在南博西南地区追歼残敌，在二十日又歼灭一百五十名敌人，其中大多数是被俘或投诚的。到二十日为止，爱国武装力量在南博地区共歼敌约两千人。
