The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." This means that our Communist Party engages in class struggle. During the past period of democratic revolution, we had to engage in class struggle, and in the present period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we must also engage in class struggle. Not only do we engage in class struggle, but we must treat it as the most important task.

However, the bad guy Khrushchev in China opposes our Party engaging in class struggle. Especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, his arrogance in opposing our Party engaging in class struggle has become even more rampant. He blathers on about how "the issue of whether socialism or capitalism will prevail in our country has already been resolved." He also boasts: "There are no more landlords, no more capitalists, ... there are only three kinds of people: workers, peasants, and intellectuals." He sets the task for the Party as "developing productive forces" and "organizing social life."

This is completely a cover-up for landlords and rich peasants, and a smokescreen for him to seize the Party and the country. In our rural areas, although the rule of landlords and rich peasants has long been overthrown, the exploiting classes are not willing to accept their defeat. They are still around, and their spirits are not dead. In 1957, we had a rich peasant's son in Dazhai who insisted on a reactionary stance. Because his father was struggled against during the land reform, he wanted to take class revenge and had sharpened his knife several times to kill revolutionary leaders. However, the Party branch of Dazhai is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and has never relaxed its vigilance against the class enemy for a moment. We seized this living example and used it to educate all Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants about class and class struggle, making all Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants further realize that in the socialist period, class struggle is long-term, sharp, and complex. If we do not engage in class struggle, the class enemy will seize political power from us.

As for developing production and improving living standards, our production in Dazhai has developed greatly. The grain yield has increased year by year, from 80,000 to 90,000 jin before liberation to 640,000 jin, an increase of six times. Our living standards are much better than before. But if you ask why we have developed so fast? We say: First of all, we have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and firmly grasped the struggle between the two classes and the two lines. It is to promote revolution and production, not to bury our heads and "develop productive forces" and "organize social life." If it were like that, we might not even be able to keep our heads, let alone talk about developing production and organizing social life?

Just take the facts from three or four years ago! In 1963, Dazhai suffered a devastating flood, with houses collapsing, caves caving in, and terraces being washed away. However, the Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai did not yield in the face of difficulties. The Party branch led the masses to formulate a plan to restore the land in five years and build houses in ten years. At this time, the class enemy took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, saying things like "ten years, thirty years, a hundred years, it won't work." The Party branch vigorously promoted class education, explaining that the more the enemy wants to sabotage, the more we must be vigilant and overcome the difficulties caused by the disaster as soon as possible. On the basis of raising class struggle awareness, we proposed three don'ts (don't accept state aid in the form of grain, materials, and money) and three not less (the grain produced is not less, the food ration is not less, the grain sold to the state is not less). Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, rebuilt our homes. In less than a year, the land was fully restored, and it took only three or four years to completely build stone caves and brick houses. Why were we able to achieve such great victories? The fundamental reason is that we relied on Mao Zedong Thought and first of all firmly grasped class struggle. The facts since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have even more powerfully proven this truth. Because in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were exposed, revisionism was criticized, and at the same time, the revolutionary masses were educated, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, which made last year's agricultural production in our brigade achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest.

All class enemies, they want to create trouble and sabotage, always hoping that we will sleep soundly and lay down our weapons. Khrushchev in China advocates the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," saying that in the future the main task of the Party is to "develop productive forces," which is intended to lull us into complacency and induce us to focus only on production and not on class struggle. In this way, he can push his "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "exploitation is meritorious" black goods without any scruples. If we fall for his tricks, capitalism will be restored, and the dictatorship of the proletariat will turn into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support." Khrushchev in China opposes the Communist Party engaging in class struggle, which proves that our Party's firm grasp of class struggle is correct and has achieved great results. Even such a big bad guy as Khrushchev in China has been exposed, can we say that the results are not great? As long as classes and class struggle exist, we need a fighting Communist Party, and the Communist Party must firmly grasp class struggle.

### 共产党是搞阶级斗争的

    共产党是搞阶级斗争的
    大寨大队党支部副书记　梁便良
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这就是说，我们共产党是搞阶级斗争的。在过去的民主革命时期要搞阶级斗争，在现在的社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，也要搞阶级斗争。不但搞阶级斗争，而且要把它当作头等重要的大事。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏家伙，反对我们党搞阶级斗争。特别是在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成后，他反对我们党搞阶级斗争的气焰更加嚣张。他胡说什么：“我国社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了。”他还叫嚣：“地主没有了，资本家没有了，……就只有三种人：一种是工人，一种是农民，一种是知识分子。”他给党规定的任务是“发展生产力”、“组织社会生活”。
    这完全是为地主、富农分子打掩护，是为他篡党篡国放烟幕弹。在我国农村，虽然早已推翻了地主、富农的统治，可是剥削阶级并不甘心他们的失败，他们人还在，心不死。一九五七年，我们大寨有个坚持反动立场的富农子弟，因为土改时群众斗争了他父亲，他要进行阶级报复，曾几次磨刀要杀害革命领导干部。但是我们大寨党支部是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，一时一刻都没有放松对阶级敌人的警惕。我们抓住了这个活教材，对全体党员和贫下中农进行阶级和阶级斗争的教育，使全体党员和贫下中农进一步认识到：在社会主义时期，阶级斗争是长期的尖锐的复杂的，如果我们不搞阶级斗争，阶级敌人就会专我们的政。
    要说发展生产，改善生活，我们大寨的生产是大大发展了。粮食产量逐年上升，总产量由解放前的八、九万斤增长到六十四万斤，增加六倍。我们的生活比过去不知道要好多少倍。但是，如果要问为什么发展这么快？我们说：首先因为活学活用了毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，狠抓了两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。是抓革命，促生产，而不是埋着头去“发展生产力”、“组织社会生活”。如果是那样，连脑袋也许保不住，还谈什么发展生产，什么组织社会生活？
    就拿三、四年前的事实来说吧！一九六三年，大寨遭受毁灭性的水灾，房倒、窑塌、梯田被冲垮。但是大寨的党员和贫下中农在困难面前没有屈服，党支部带领群众制定出五年恢复土地、十年修建起房屋的计划。这时，阶级敌人又乘机出来造谣破坏，说什么“十年，三十年，一百年也不行。”党支部大抓了阶级教育，说明敌人越是要破坏，我们越要提高警惕，越要及早克服灾害造成的困难。在提高阶级斗争观念的基础上，提出了三不要（不要国家支援的粮食、物资和钱），三不少（产的粮食不少，口粮不少，缴售给国家粮食不少）。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，重建家园。不到一年，土地就全部恢复，只用了三、四年时间全部修建起石窑、瓦房。我们为什么能够取得这么大的胜利？根本原因，就是依靠毛泽东思想，首先狠抓阶级斗争。无产阶级文化大革命以来的事实，更加有力地证明了这个真理。因为在无产阶级文化大革命中揪出了党内一小撮走资派，批判了修正主义，同时教育了革命群众，促进了人的思想革命化，才使去年我们大队的农业生产获得从来没有过的大丰收。
    一切阶级敌人，他们要进行捣乱、破坏，总是希望我们睡大觉、放下武器。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，说什么今后党的任务主要是“发展生产力”，就是妄想麻痹我们，引诱我们专搞生产，不抓阶级斗争。这样，他就可以毫无顾忌地去推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”等黑货。我们如果上了他的当，资本主义就会复辟，无产阶级专政就会变成资产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。中国赫鲁晓夫反对共产党搞阶级斗争，证明我们党狠抓阶级斗争抓对了，做出了很大成绩。连中国赫鲁晓夫这样的大坏蛋都被揪了出来，能说成绩不大吗？只要有阶级和阶级斗争存在，就需要有战斗的共产党，共产党就要狠抓阶级斗争。
