	Promoting Agricultural Production and Strongly Supporting the Battlefield
	Vietnam's Industrial Support for Agriculture Achieves Great Success

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to the Vietnam News Agency, in the past two years, the industrial front of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has provided 5,500 sets of small-scale mechanical equipment to agricultural cooperatives, promoting the development of agricultural production.

	These sets of equipment generally include one diesel engine, one rice hulling machine, several feed processing machines, and one or two mechanical water pumps.

	These pieces of equipment have been installed and used in various provinces, including the southernmost part of North Vietnam, which has been subjected to the most intense bombardment by U.S. aircraft and warships.

	These small machines, especially the rice hulling machines and mechanical water pumps, have significantly reduced the labor intensity of the cooperative members, allowing them to devote more energy to strengthening cultivation and supporting the battlefield.

	Over the past two years, industrial units have paid great attention to training technical workers for the cooperatives to operate these small-scale machines. In the 16 vocational schools in various provinces and cities, tens of thousands of such technical workers have been trained.

    促进农业生产　有力支援战斗
    越南工业支援农业成绩巨大
    新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道：最近两年，越南民主共和国的工业战线向农业合作社提供了五千五百套小型机械设备，促进农业生产的发展。
    这些设备中一般每一套都包括一台柴油发动机、一台碾米机、几部饲料加工机和一、两部机械水泵。
    这些设备已经在各省，包括越南北方最南端、一直遭到美国飞机和军舰最猛烈轰击的地区安装使用。
    这些小型机器，特别是碾米机和机械水泵，大大减轻了农业社社员的劳动强度，使他们能把更多的精力抽出来加强耕作和支援战斗。
    在过去两年中，工业单位十分注意为农业社培训操作这些小型机械的技术工人。在各省市的十六个职业学校中，共培训了好几万这种技术工人。
