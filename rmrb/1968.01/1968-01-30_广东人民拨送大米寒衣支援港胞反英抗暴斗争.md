To further support the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting the Anti-British Struggle of Patriotic Compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon has decided to allocate 5,000 tons of rice during the Spring Festival. This rice will be distributed to patriotic workers and other compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon as a gesture of goodwill.

At the same time, the Guangdong branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, considering the current cold weather and the lack of warm clothing for patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon who have been unjustly detained by the British authorities, has decided to allocate 1,000 sets of winter clothing to those still in custody.

    广东人民拨送大米寒衣支援港胞反英抗暴斗争
    新华社广州二十九日电　为进一步支援港九爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会决定在春节期间拨发大米五千吨，分发我港九爱国工人和其他爱国同胞，以示慰问。
    与此同时，中国红十字会广东省分会鉴于当前正值冬寒，被港英当局无理拘捕的我港九爱国同胞缺乏御寒衣物，决定拨发寒衣一千套给尚在监禁中的爱国同胞。
