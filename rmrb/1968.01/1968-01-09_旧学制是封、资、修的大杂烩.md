	"The educational system needs to be shortened, and education needs to be revolutionized." This is Chairman Mao's great directive, which we must carry out.

	Our country's full-time ordinary education system is divided into three stages (primary school, middle school, university) and six levels (elementary school, upper elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, university, graduate school). This system was basically established in the first educational system officially promulgated and implemented by the Qing Dynasty in 1903, modeled after the Japanese educational system. The difference then was that middle school was not divided into junior and senior levels, but there was a preparatory course before the university undergraduate program, making the total study period from primary school to university 20 to 21 years. Each level and type of school placed particular emphasis on the teaching of classical studies and the cultivation of traditional ethics. Although the imperial examination system had been abolished, schools still retained a strong feudal examination culture. Graduation exams were still conducted in the form of imperial examinations; graduates were still awarded imperial examination qualifications according to their ranks, such as "Jinshi" for university graduates, "Juren" for preparatory course graduates, and "Gongsheng" for those who graduated from middle school and were admitted to the preparatory course. Overseas students were correspondingly awarded titles such as "Foreign Jinshi" and "Foreign Juren." Graduates could also obtain various official titles according to their ranks. The imperial examination system had died in name but lived in reality, only wearing a suit of comprador "Western clothes."

	After the Xinhai Revolution, the educational system was revised, nominally abolishing the reading of classics in primary schools and the practice of awarding imperial examination qualifications to graduates according to their ranks, reducing the total study period by three years. However, primary and secondary schools were still mostly "revering Confucius" and reading classics, and the pursuit of official positions did not decrease, while comprador and slave-like habits became even more serious.

	After World War I, the pragmatist educational trend of American imperialism became even more rampant in our country. In 1922, the educational system was revised, changing from copying Japan to copying the United States. For example, primary school was changed from seven years to six years; middle school was changed from four years to six years, divided into junior and senior levels, each for three years; the preparatory course for universities was abolished. From primary school to university, it still took 16 to 18 years.

	After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev almost completely retained this system and painted it with a layer of revisionist color, making it a hodgepodge of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism.

	The old educational system is extraordinarily long. It embodies the needs of all exploiting classes, hates the workers and peasants, despises manual labor, and looks down on practice. The exploiting classes worship books, believing that "all other professions are inferior, only reading is superior." They all want to train their successors to be "all-rounders," "strategists," and "experts" who can exploit, oppress, and enslave the laboring people. They keep students in school for a long time, not engaging in production, not associating with workers and peasants, so that students have enough time to read the prescribed books, pass multiple exams, and obtain as many points as possible, gaining higher academic qualifications as capital to exchange for fame and fortune in the future. The longer the students stay in the study room reading books, the better their exam scores, the higher their academic qualifications, the more fame and fortune they can obtain.

	Therefore, the long educational system is a necessary product of the exploiting class education. It, together with other links in the exploiting class education system (such as curriculum, examinations, textbooks, teaching methods, etc.), forms a huge machine for the exploiting class to produce successors.

	Poor and lower-middle peasants complain: "The long educational system is the 'rent collection office' of the landlords and rich peasants, and the 'gate of ghosts' for the poor and lower-middle peasants! 'The passing score line is the line of bourgeois restoration, and the blockade line for excluding the children of workers and peasants!' The Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, maintain the long educational system, and commit heinous crimes that must be thoroughly settled!"

    旧学制是封、资、修的大杂烩
    中央教育科学研究所革命联合总部
    “学制要缩短，教育要革命”。这是毛主席的伟大指示，我们一定要贯彻执行。
    我国普通教育全日制学校，分三段（小学、中学、大学）六级（初小、高小、初中、高中、大学、研究班）。这一套学制，早在一九○三年清朝正式颁布施行的第一个学制系统中，就基本上按日本学制的模子确立下来了。和现在不同的，只是那时中学还没有分初高两级，但大学本科之前设有预科，由小学到大学，修业年限长达二十年至二十一年之久。各级各类学校都特别注重经学的传授和旧礼教的陶冶。那时，科举制度虽已废除，但学校仍然保留着浓厚的封建科举的色彩。毕业考试还是仿照科举形式；毕业生还是按等级奖给科举出身的资格，如大学本科毕业的就奖给进士，大学预科毕业的就奖给举人，中学毕业又考上大学预科的就奖给贡生。留学生相应地也奖给“洋进士”、“洋举人”等。毕业生还可以按等级获得种种官衔。科举名亡而实存，只是披上了一套买办的“洋服”而已。
    辛亥革命后，改订了学制，名义上废止小学读经，废止给毕业生按等级奖给科举出身资格的办法，全部修业年限缩短了三年。但是，中小学多半还是“尊孔”读经，求功名的思想并未减少，而买办洋奴习气则更加严重。
    第一次世界大战后，美帝国主义的实用主义教育思潮更加猖狂地侵袭我国。一九二二年，改订了学制，由抄袭日本改为抄袭美国。如将小学由七年改为六年；将中学由四年改为六年，分初中、高中，各为三年；取消大学的预科。从小学到大学仍达十六年至十八年之多。
    解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫把这套学制几乎原封不动地保留下来，并涂上一层修正主义的油彩，使它成为封、资、修三毒俱全的大杂烩。
    旧学制出奇的长。它体现了一切剥削阶级的需要，仇视工农，蔑视体力劳动，鄙视实践。剥削阶级崇尚书本，认为“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”。他们都要把自己的接班人培养成能够剥削、压迫和奴役劳动人民的“通才”、“谋士”和“专家”。他们让学生长期关在学校中，不事生产，不近工农，使学生有足够的时间，读完规定的书本，通过多次的考试，争得尽量多的分数，取得更高的学历，作为将来换取功名利禄的资本。这样，学生关在书房死读书的年限越长，考试录取的等第越好，争得的学历资格越高，换取的功名利禄就越大。
    因此，长学制是剥削阶级教育的必然产物。它和剥削阶级教育体系的其它环节（如课程、考试、教材、教法等）搭配在一起，成为剥削阶级制造接班人的一部庞大的机器。
    贫下中农控诉说：“长学制，是地富的‘收租院’，是贫下中农的鬼门关！”“分数线，是资产阶级的复辟线，是排斥工农子女的封锁线！”中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙推行反革命修正主义教育路线，维护长学制，犯下了滔天的罪行，必须彻底清算！
