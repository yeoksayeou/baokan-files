Pakistan Government Foils Indian Conspiracy

According to a news bulletin issued by the Pakistani Ministry of the Interior on January 6, the Pakistani government recently thwarted an attempt by the Indian authorities to use a small group of anti-national elements in Pakistan to separate East Pakistan.

The first secretary of the Indian diplomatic mission in the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka, Ojeha, had maintained contact with some of these anti-national elements. Some of these anti-national elements had gone to Agartala in India to obtain a large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and the funds needed to carry out their plan.

The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman announced in Rawalpindi on January 6 that the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs had notified the Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan to immediately recall the first secretary, Ojeha, to India.
