The reason why the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories is that it has the great prestige of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and it has the great People's Liberation Army as a strong backing. To launch the Spring Festival support the army movement, we must first mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to further study the shining example of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve the revolutionization of one's thoughts. We must, like the PLA, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, the three-eighths style, and the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention. We must take "criticize and repudiate revisionism, criticize and repudiate the self" as the key link, thoroughly criticize and repudiate selfishness, and establish public-mindedness, enhance proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and enthusiastically support and assist the PLA in doing a good job in the "three supports, two military" work.

	The meeting believed that under the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the support the army, love the people movement, military-civilian unity will be further strengthened, and various fronts will deeply launch revolutionary criticism, promote and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and solidly do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit, "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," and in the period before and after the Spring Festival, bring about a new upsurge in revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones in the Shanghai region, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The meeting made specific arrangements regarding the support the army, love the people movement throughout the city and required relevant units to check, revise, and implement the support the army agreements, and do a good job in the Spring Festival consolation work, hold meetings for the study and use of Chairman Mao's works and for the exchange of experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, do a good job in the welfare work for military dependents, families of martyrs, and honorable military personnel, and do a good job in the placement of retired and demobilized military personnel.

All revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses in the city must closely unite with the People's Liberation Army, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, immediately launch a wave of great study, great propaganda, and great implementation, and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, with great enthusiasm, strive to be the best, and strive for continuous progress, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.
