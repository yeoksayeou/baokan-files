The U.S.-puppet clique's stronghold of Saigon and the city of Da Nang have recently seen large-scale anti-U.S. demonstrations and strikes, leaving the U.S.-puppet clique in a state of disarray.

According to Western news agencies, 5,000 dock workers in Saigon went on strike at noon on the 12th, paralyzing the largest port in South Vietnam. "About twelve ships loaded with commercial goods were unable to unload their cargo." The U.S. authorities in Vietnam were forced to deploy the U.S. Army to handle the supplies from U.S. military ships. It was reported that on the 11th, 3,500 power plant workers in Saigon announced a strike to protest the U.S.-puppet regime's attempt to cut their wages. The dock workers in Saigon, in support of the power plant workers' struggle and in protest of the U.S.-puppet regime's brutal suppression of the workers' strike, went on strike on the 12th.

It was also reported that a large number of farmers from the outskirts of Da Nang, the largest U.S. military base in the central region, poured into the city on the 8th of this month to hold a demonstration against the U.S. imperialists' aggression. The ruthless U.S.-puppet regime sent in a large number of military police to brutally suppress the demonstrators, illegally arresting 160 farmers.

The U.S. aggressors are terrified by this anti-U.S. demonstration. A U.S. official in Da Nang admitted that this place, which had previously seen large-scale anti-U.S. demonstrations, is "once again filled with discontent towards the U.S.-puppet clique." A U.S. "advisor" to the Da Nang puppet police chief also expressed anxiety, saying, "In the coming months, we will encounter many such incidents."

    美伪集团脚下的土地在燃烧
    西贡和岘港爆发大规模反美示威
    西贡五千名码头工人大罢工使南越最大港口陷于瘫痪
    新华社十三日讯 西贡消息：正当越南南方人民解放武装力量在战场上不断进攻敌人，捷报频传的时候，美伪集团统治中心的西贡市和岘港市最近又爆发了大规模的罢工和反美示威，使美伪集团陷于首尾不能相顾的困境中。
    据西方通讯社报道，西贡港口的五千名码头工人十二日中午举行罢工，使南越这个最大的港口陷于瘫痪，停泊在港口的“大约十二艘装着商业货物的船只的卸货工作陷于停顿”。美国侵越当局被迫不得不出动美国陆军来搬运美国军用货船的物资。据报道，在这之前的十一日，西贡的三千五百名电力工人宣布罢工，反对美伪当局企图削减他们的工资。西贡码头工人为了支援电力工人的斗争和抗议美伪当局镇压工人罢工的暴行，在十二日发动了罢工。
    另据报道，美帝国主义在中部地区的最大军事基地——岘港市郊区的大批农民，本月八日涌进这个城市举行示威，反对美帝国主义的侵略罪行。丧心病狂的美伪当局出动大批军警，对示威群众进行血腥镇压，非法逮捕了一百六十名农民。
    美国侵略者对这次反美示威胆颤心惊。岘港的一名美国官员承认，这个过去曾经爆发过大规模反美示威的地方对美伪集团“又充满了不满情绪”。岘港伪警察长的一名美国“顾问”也惶惶不安地说，“今后几个月内，我们将会遇到许多这种事件。”
