Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution."

The revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They fight against the enemy with a red heart and bright eyes, firmly and fearlessly, demonstrating the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class; they fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism with loyalty and frankness, taking the initiative to attack, embodying the noble quality of selflessness of the working class. They bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, battling storms and overcoming difficulties, achieving double victories in revolution and production, and are truly the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Recently, their representatives proudly attended the Second Session of the Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the General Logistics Department, serving as a red banner for the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the factories under the General Logistics Department.

	Always Remembering Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions,
	Thoroughly Smashing the Tricks of the Class Enemy

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory, who have emerged from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, always remember the latest instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao. They have waged a resolute struggle against all the tricks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

On January 7 of last year, certain individuals in the old factory committee, following the black instructions of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, intending to issue additional wages to the young workers in the factory. Two hundred thousand yuan in cash was brought back from the bank.

The revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought held an emergency meeting and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "You must concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Some said: "Chairman Mao initiated this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to ensure that our country will never change color for thousands of generations; if we stir up issues of welfare and benefits, we will fall into the trap of the class enemy, letting money blind our eyes, and we will deviate from the direction of the struggle." Everyone realized that whether or not they could resist this evil wind was a severe test for the revolutionary masses, a major issue of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said firmly: "The working class will always be loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao. No matter how strong the evil wind blows, we will stand firm!"

The revolutionary masses went among the masses to expose the class enemy's new tricks. Revolutionary old workers, after finishing their work, did not eat or rest, rushing to the office building. With tears of excitement, they studied Chairman Mao's works with the young workers and recalled bitterness and sweetness together. They used their own bitter experiences of being exploited and oppressed by landlords and capitalists in the old society to arouse the class consciousness of the young workers, educating them to listen to Chairman Mao's words and care about the fate of the Party and the country. The office building became a large classroom for class education. At home, they also carried out mutual assistance in ideology. Revolutionary fighter Xiao Mo educated his wife: "Initially, we did not seek fame or wealth, we were not afraid of being labeled 'counter-revolutionaries,' and we stood up to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. If we stir up issues of welfare, forget the direction of the struggle, how can we face Chairman Mao?" His wife raised her awareness and, together with the young workers, exposed the class enemy's evil plot to corrupt them. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary workers. The young workers, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and deep hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, posted big-character posters that night. They said: "We want Mao Zedong Thought, we don't want the stinking money that corrupts our souls!" When the revolutionary fighters returned the money to the bank, the revolutionary bank workers tightly held their hands, excitedly saying: "You resisted the counter-revolutionary economic wind and were the first to return the money intact. You are truly outstanding!"

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory repelled the counter-revolutionary economic wind stirred up by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advanced rapidly along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

	Eliminating Interference, Overcoming Factionalism, and Unconditionally Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory." The revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory, through revolutionary struggle practice, realized: bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the great enemy of the working class, the great enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the great enemy of carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, it is necessary to, while struggling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, resolutely struggle against factionalism within our own ranks. They consciously resisted and resolutely overcame the infiltration of various non-proletarian ideologies from society, closely following the great commander Chairman Mao, advancing steadfastly.

Following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, the seven revolutionary mass organizations in this factory achieved revolutionary great unity as early as February last year and established the "Worker Revolutionary Rebel Corps." In mid-March, during the "January Revolution" storm, the "Jinggangshan" Combat Team, which had stopped activities, resumed activities, forming two factions, and the "internal war" intensified. Some comrades in the "Rebel Corps" thought that their organization was an old rebel group and that their direction had always been correct, while many in the other faction had taken the wrong side in the early stages of the movement, so they wanted to "swallow" the other side. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "To resolve contradictions among the people, one must not use curses, nor fists, nor weapons, but only the method of discussion, the method of persuasion, the method of criticism and self-criticism. In a word, one must use democratic methods, the method of letting the masses speak." They realized: all revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers are class brothers. We must not do things that cause pain to our loved ones and joy to our enemies.

Following Chairman Mao's words is the noble quality of the working class. The next day, the "Rebel Corps" held a meeting of its members, and the responsible person, representing the committee, made a self-criticism. Holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," facing Chairman Mao's portrait, he said painfully: "Chairman Mao, we have violated your teachings because of factionalism, causing us to make mistakes. In the future, we will always follow your words, overthrow factionalism, and always follow you in revolution!"

The great commander Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." This great command, like a spring thunder, shook the hearts of every revolutionary fighter. People rushed to tell each other. The entire factory immediately saw a surge in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the workshops, dining halls, and dormitories, people engaged in heated discussions, expressing: Chairman Mao has issued a battle command for us workers. Whatever he says, we will do. The great unity in the factory cannot be delayed for a single minute. Revolutionary fighters urged the responsible persons of the two factions to sit down and negotiate, and many people voluntarily came to listen. The rooms were packed inside and out. If a leader said something against great unity, the masses immediately rebelled against him. They said: "The working class has a common revolutionary goal and has a thousand and one reasons to unite, but not a single reason not to unite." They fiercely fought against selfishness, severely criticized factionalism, and finally quickly leveled the small hills, achieving revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, establishing the factory revolutionary committee.

On the issue of cadres, some workers in the 3516 Factory, influenced by the extreme "leftist" trends in society, put forward the incorrect slogan of "all cadres to the side." The revolutionary fighters believed that this did not conform to Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," and was a disruption of the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, which must be resolutely resisted. They organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related expositions on the cadre issue, conducted a class analysis of cadres, pointing out that revolutionary cadres are the precious assets of the Party and the people, and are an important force for grasping revolution, promoting production, and carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. While fully mobilizing the masses to expose and criticize the members of the old factory committee who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, they boldly allowed revolutionary cadres to manage production, supported their correct opinions, and maintained and guaranteed the various systems for normal production. For those cadres who made mistakes, even serious mistakes, they believed that "the disease is in the cadres, but the root is in the Chinese Khrushchev," and the revolutionary fighters actively approached the cadres who made mistakes, patiently and warmly helping them, making the cadres quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Currently, more than 90% of the cadres in this factory have been liberated. They deeply felt: "What nurtured our growth is Mao Zedong Thought, what harmed us is the Chinese Khrushchev, and what saved us is the revolutionary masses."

	Repeatedly Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions,
	Achieving Double Victories in Revolution and Production

The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country" points out: "The working class is the leading force of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country." The revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory, with unlimited loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, repeatedly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They printed the six big characters of "grasp revolution, promote production" in their minds and carved them in their hearts, turning them into conscious actions, always insisting on making revolution on the spot, making revolution in their spare time, and making revolution through economizing, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The world-shaking "January Revolution" storm sounded the death knell for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. They, in order to save their doomed fate, manipulated a handful of bad leaders to deceive the masses and detach them from their production posts, going north to "accuse." Some of the deceived masses in this factory also left the factory, affecting the entire factory's production. At this critical moment, the revolutionary masses resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They loudly put forward: "Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud." Once, more than two hundred tons of materials arrived at the station and had to be transported back immediately. At that time, there were not enough manpower and transportation tools, and the revolutionary masses worked overnight to transport the materials. Many comrades, after working hard during the day, rushed to the front lines of the struggle. Some people had broken and swollen hands but still insisted on fighting, battling all night to complete the task. Some key production posts were left vacant, causing great difficulties for production. Old workers stepped forward, saying: "We have Mao Zedong Thought, and we can withstand even if the sky falls!"

In February of last year, the revolutionary masses of this factory discovered that the annual production value planned by the factory was 210,000 yuan less than in 1966. Some cadres thought that revolution is an extraordinary time, and it is inevitable that production will be less.

An old worker responsible for production in the "Rebel Corps" was so concerned about this issue that he couldn't sleep for several nights. The responsible comrades of the "Rebel Corps" convened a meeting of relevant personnel to study the "Sixteen Points": "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make people's thinking revolutionary, so that all work can be done better, faster, and more efficiently." They said: "Chairman Mao wants us to 'grasp revolution, promote production.' We, the working class, must be both the vanguard of revolution and the pioneers of production." Thus, they mobilized the masses, used their brains, tapped potential, and re-planned the annual production plan, with the total production value significantly higher than the original plan. The broad masses of workers voluntarily fought to achieve this plan. When one workshop encountered production difficulties, other workshops would actively dispatch the best machines and the most skilled workers to support them; when the supply of raw materials from outside was disrupted, they would do their best to organize local processing; when equipment was insufficient, they would dig deep into potential and make a large number of equipment. Through the joint efforts of the revolutionary workers in the entire factory, they finally overfulfilled this plan.

The revolutionary masses of this factory, in repeatedly implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," demonstrated the working class's lofty patriotism and internationalism. What they saw was not just their own team, workshop, or factory, but all of China and the world. When Workshop One received a batch of production tasks with tight deadlines and high requirements, the worker comrades said: "Doing well in production is to aid the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and it is our duty." They treated the workshop as a battlefield, eating, sleeping, and fighting in the workshop, and excellently completed the task, shortening the production cycle by fifteen days and achieving the highest level of first-class product rate of 100%.

The great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" was further implemented in the 3516 Factory, and the situation of revolution and production became better and better. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire factory saw a new upsurge. The broad revolutionary workers were full of spirit and fighting spirit, breaking down foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas, vigorously carrying out technological innovations and technological revolutions. Some projects reached the advanced level in the country, and labor productivity continued to improve. Starting from February 1967, they completed the production plan month by month, and the entire year completed the production task six days ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of the great commander, we will listen well to our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!" The revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory, through more than a year of personal experience in class struggle, deeply felt that this is a great truth. They were able to achieve one victory after another, fundamentally and crucially, because they honestly listened to Chairman Mao's words and unconditionally implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In the struggle to achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the 3516 Factory are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, remain humble and vigilant, and continue to strive, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, striving to turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and striving for an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    后勤战线执行毛主席最新指示的一面红旗
    ——记解放军总后勤部三五一六工厂无产阶级革命派的先进事迹
    毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”
    三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们与敌人斗，心红眼亮，坚定无畏，表现了工人阶级彻底的革命精神；与资产阶级、小资产阶级派性斗，忠诚坦白，主动进攻，体现了工人阶级大公无私的崇高品质。他们勇挑革命、生产两副重担，战恶浪，闯难关，夺得革命、生产双胜利，不愧为毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级。最近，他们的代表光荣地出席了总后勤部第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，是总后勤部所属工厂落实毛主席最新指示的一面红旗。
      时刻牢记毛主席最新指示，
        彻底粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”从资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖中冲杀出来的三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，时刻牢记伟大统帅毛主席的这一最新指示，对党内一小撮走资派妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的一切阴谋诡计，进行了坚决的斗争，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    去年一月七日，旧厂党委中的某些人，秉承上海旧市委内一小撮走资派的黑指示，刮起了反革命经济主义妖风，要给厂里青年工人补发工资，两万元的人民币从银行领了回来。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，召开了紧急会议，认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”有的说：“毛主席他老人家发动了这场无产阶级文化大革命，是为保证我们国家千秋万代不变颜色；如果闹福利待遇，恰好上了阶级敌人的当，让金钱迷住了眼睛，就会转移斗争大方向。”大家认识到，能不能顶住这股妖风，是摆在无产阶级革命派面前的严峻考验，是对毛主席的革命路线忠不忠的大问题。他们斩钉截铁地说：“工人阶级永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，妖风刮得再大，我们也顶得住！”
    无产阶级革命派纷纷到群众中揭发阶级敌人这一新阴谋。革命的老工人们，下了班，顾不得吃饭，忘记了疲劳，赶到办公大楼，他们含着激动的热泪，和青年工人一起学习毛主席著作，一同忆苦思甜。他们用自己在旧社会受地主、资本家剥削压迫的苦难遭遇，激发青年工人的阶级觉悟，教育他们要听毛主席的话，关心党和国家的命运。办公大楼成了阶级教育的大课堂。在家庭里，也展开了思想互助。革命派战士小莫教育他爱人说：“当初我们不为名，不为利，不怕被打成‘反革命’，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，起来造党内一小撮走资派的反。如果我们闹福利，忘记了斗争大方向，怎么对得起毛主席他老人家！”他爱人提高了认识，和青年工人们一起揭露阶级敌人腐蚀他们的罪恶阴谋。战无不胜的毛泽东思想照亮了革命工人的心，青年工人们怀着对党内一小撮走资派的刻骨仇恨，怀着对毛主席革命路线的深厚阶级感情，当晚贴出大字报。他们说：“我们要毛泽东思想，不要腐蚀我们灵魂的臭钱！”当革命派战士把这笔钱送回银行时，银行革命职工紧紧握着他们的手，激动地说：“你们顶住反革命经济主义妖风，第一个把钱原封不动退回来，真是好样的！”
    三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，击退了党内一小撮走资派煽起的反革命经济主义妖风。使无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的航向迅速前进。
    排除干扰，克服派性，不折不扣地执行毛主席最新指示
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，通过革命斗争实践认识到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是工人阶级的大敌，是落实毛主席最新指示的大敌，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大敌。要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须在和党内一小撮走资派斗争的同时，和自己队伍里的派性作坚决斗争。他们对于来自社会上的种种非无产阶级思潮的侵蚀，自觉抵制，坚决克服，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，坚定不移向前进。
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，这个工厂的七个革命群众组织，早在去年二月份就实现了革命的大联合，成立了“工人革命造反纵队”。三月中旬，在“一月革命”风暴时停止活动的“井冈山”战斗队，又重新恢复活动，形成了两派，“内战”激烈起来。“造反纵队”的部分同志认为自己组织是老造反，过去大方向一直是正确的，而对方很多人在运动初期站错了队，便想把对方“吃”掉。后来，他们学习了毛主席的教导：“解决人民内部矛盾，不能用咒骂，也不能用拳头，更不能用刀枪，只能用讨论的方法，说理的方法，批评和自我批评的方法。一句话，只能用民主的方法，让群众讲话的方法。”认识到：广大革命干部和革命职工，都是阶级兄弟。我们决不能干亲者痛、仇者快的事。
    听毛主席的话，是工人阶级的崇高品质。第二天，“造反纵队”召开队员大会，负责人代表队委作了检查。他拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，面对着毛主席像，沉痛地说：“毛主席啊，我们违背了您老人家的教导，因为派性，使我们犯了错误，今后，我们要永远听您老人家的话，打倒派性，永远跟着您干革命！”
    伟大统帅毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这个伟大的号令，象一声春雷，震撼着每个革命派战士的心，人们奔走相告。全厂立即出现了一个学习毛主席最新指示的热潮。车间里，饭厅里，宿舍里，人们展开了热烈的讨论，纷纷表示：毛主席他老人家给我们工人阶级发出战斗号令了，他老人家怎么说，我们就怎么干，厂里的大联合一分钟也不能拖延了。广大革命派战士催促两派负责人坐到一起谈判，很多人自动跑来旁听。屋里屋外挤得满满的。头头说了不利于大联合的话，群众当场就造他的反。他们说：“我们工人阶级有共同的革命目标，有一千条一万条理由联合起来，没有半点理由不联合。”他们狠斗私心，猛批派性，终于很快削平了小山头，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，成立了厂革命委员会。
    在干部问题上，三五一六工厂有些工人受社会上极“左”思潮的影响，提出“干部统统靠边”的错误口号。无产阶级革命派战士认为这不符合毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的最新指示，是干扰毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示的落实的，必须坚决抵制。他们组织大家学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示和有关论述，对干部进行阶级分析，指出广大革命干部是党和人民的宝贵财产，是抓革命，促生产，搞好无产阶级文化大革命的重要力量。他们在充分发动群众揭发批判执行资产阶级反动路线的旧厂党委某些成员的同时，放手让广大革命干部大胆管理生产，支持他们的正确意见，维护保障正常生产的各项制度。对于那些犯了错误甚至严重错误的干部，他们也认为“病在干部身上，根子在中国赫鲁晓夫身上”，革命派战士主动接近犯错误的干部，热情耐心地帮助他们，使干部迅速回到毛主席革命路线上来。目前，这个厂百分之九十以上的干部已经解放。他们深有感触地说：“哺育我们成长的是毛泽东思想，害我们的是中国赫鲁晓夫，挽救我们的是广大革命群众。”
      反复落实毛主席最新指示，
          夺取革命、生产双胜利
    《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》中指出：“工人阶级是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量。”三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，以对伟大统帅毛主席的无限忠诚，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，反复落实毛主席最新指示。把“抓革命，促生产”六个大字印在脑子里，刻在心坎上，变成自觉的行动，始终坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命，取得了革命、生产双胜利。
    震撼世界的“一月革命”风暴，敲响了上海市党内一小撮走资派的丧钟，他们为了挽救灭亡的命运，操纵一小撮坏头头，蒙蔽群众脱离生产岗位，北上“控告”。这个厂的部分受蒙蔽群众，也离了厂，全厂生产受了影响。在这紧要关头，无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，他们响亮地提出：“毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气。”有一次，车站上到了二百多吨物资必须马上运回，当时人力和运输工具都不足，无产阶级革命派连夜突击运输，很多同志在白天紧张劳动之后，又争先恐后地投入抢运。有的人手破了，肿了，仍坚持战斗，奋战一夜，完成任务。有些关键性生产岗位的人员离开后，给生产带来很大的困难。老工人挺身而出，他们说：“我们有毛泽东思想，天塌下来也顶得住！”
    去年二月，这个厂的无产阶级革命派发现厂部编制的年度计划总产值比一九六六年少了二十一万元。有的干部认为，革命是非常时期，生产少点是难免的。
  “造反纵队”负责抓生产的一位老工人为这件事几天几夜没睡好觉。“造反纵队”负责同志召集有关人员，学习了“十六条”：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”他们说：“毛主席他老人家要我们‘抓革命，促生产’，我们工人阶级就既要当革命的先锋，又要当生产的闯将。”于是，他们发动群众，动脑筋，挖潜力，重新编制了年度生产计划，总产值比原计划大大提高。广大工人群众自觉地为实现这个计划奋斗。当一个车间生产发生困难的时候，其他车间就主动抽出最好的机器、最熟练的工人去支援；当外地原材料供应脱节的时候，他们就千方百计就地组织加工；当设备不足的时候，他们大挖潜力，自制了大量设备。经过全厂革命职工共同努力，结果超额完成了这个计划。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派，在反复落实毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，表现了工人阶级崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神。他们看到的不是自己的一个班组，一个车间，一个工厂，而是全中国，全世界。一车间接到了一批生产任务，时间紧，要求高，工人同志们说：“搞好生产，是援助世界人民的革命斗争，是我们义不容辞的责任。”他们把车间当战场，吃在车间，睡在车间，战斗在车间，出色地完成了任务，生产周期缩短了十五天，创造了一等品率百分之百的最高水平。
    “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在三五一六工厂进一步落实，革命、生产形势越来越好，全厂活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，出现了新高潮。广大革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，大破洋框框、洋教条，大搞技术革新、技术革命，有的项目达到了国内先进水平，劳动生产率不断提高，从一九六七年二月份起，月月完成生产计划，全年提前六天保质保量完成了生产任务。
    林副主席指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，从一年多亲身经历的阶级斗争实践中，深刻地体会到这是个伟大的真理。他们能够取得一个又一个胜利，根本的根本，关键的关键，就是老老实实地听毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，三五一六工厂的无产阶级革命派，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示，为把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
