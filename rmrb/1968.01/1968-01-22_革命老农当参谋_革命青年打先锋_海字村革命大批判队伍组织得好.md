Revolutionary old farmers serve as strategists, and revolutionary youth act as vanguards. The revolutionary criticism team in Hai Village is well organized.

The entire village has formed 18 Mao Zedong Thought study groups, established many family study classes, and organized livestock keepers and drivers to participate in the criticism. Old farmers and children of poor and lower-middle peasants have formed "old strategist teams" and cultural propaganda teams, respectively. Every household, regardless of gender or age, uses various forms to verbally and in writing condemn the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in attempting to restore capitalism.

The new "three-in-one combination" leadership team in Hai Village, Shangzhuang Commune, Changping County, Beijing, has firmly relied on poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out revolutionary criticism, mobilizing the entire village to participate in the struggle to eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism. The movement is vigorous and lively, and winter production is proceeding rapidly and smoothly.

Over the past two months, every evening, the production brigade headquarters of Hai Village at the foot of the silver mountain are brightly lit. People passionately denounce the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism. Many families participate, with children lining up to enter the scene, elderly people sitting on warm kangs, and young people singing the song "Never Forget Class Bitterness, Remember Blood Debts."

Hai Village is a mountainous village. The 150-plus households in the village have formed 18 Mao Zedong Thought study groups to study Chairman Mao's works and criticize the crimes of China's Khrushchev. Many families have also established study classes, with old and young together fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The livestock keepers and drivers in the village, who were previously considered unable to participate in the movement due to their night shifts and mobility, have now been organized into criticism study classes. Sick people, elderly people, and female members with heavy household chores who cannot participate in study classes have young people going door-to-door with them to recall the bitter history of poor and lower-middle peasants, and denounce China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," "class struggle extinction theory," and "material incentives."

Why is the revolutionary criticism movement in Hai Village so widely and deeply mobilized? The head of the newly established leadership team said: With the help of the army's agricultural support team, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a surging revolutionary army." We focused on two teams: one is the Mao Zedong Thought cultural propaganda team composed of children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and the other is the "old strategist team" composed of revolutionary old farmers. These two teams work closely together, making the revolutionary criticism work "alive."

Chairman Mao teaches: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." To promote the revolutionary criticism movement, 32 children of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hai Village formed the Mao Zedong Thought cultural propaganda team. They use local broadcasts, blackboards, and performances to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. The propaganda team follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, combines the actual situation of the village, and has performed more than 30 shows with more than 90 items. The themes of the performances mainly propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, expose China's Khrushchev's crimes of restoring capitalism in the countryside, and stage new people and new events that appear in the village's criticism, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the criticism. The masses say: "After watching the propaganda team's performance, it's really eye-opening"; "Who would have thought that China's Khrushchev wanted us to drink bitter water again, we firmly do not agree!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants evaluate the propaganda team as, "Our village's propaganda team has played a role in uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy."

The students of Hai Village Primary School, under the leadership of revolutionary teachers, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "studying as the main task, also criticizing the bourgeoisie" after resuming classes and making revolution. They followed the village's criticism arrangement, took the lead in selecting relevant works of Chairman Mao and articles on revolutionary criticism from newspapers, and propagated the importance of revolutionary criticism to their parents, taught revolutionary songs, and assisted the elderly in reading Chairman Mao's quotations and criticism materials. These young children became reliable assistants to the Mao Zedong Thought cultural propaganda team.

Hai Village is an old liberated area. From the days of fighting guerrilla warfare, land reform, cooperativization, and communalization, there has always been a group of revolutionary old farmers serving as grassroots leaders. They have a firm stand, are familiar with the history of class struggle in the village, and have the advantage of connecting with the masses. The newly established leadership team of Hai Village attaches great importance to the enthusiasm of this group of revolutionary old farmers and has established a seven-person "old strategist team." This "old strategist team" has played an important role in the revolutionary criticism movement. They analyze the class struggle situation in the village with the brigade leadership team and formulate criticism plans. To better eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, according to their suggestions, the brigade determined the focus of the criticism to be on the "class struggle extinction theory," "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," and "material incentives." The members of the "old strategist team" are mostly old poor and lower-middle peasants with deep bitterness and hatred. In criticizing China's Khrushchev's "exploitation is meritorious" and "class struggle extinction theory," they take the lead in recalling bitterness and sweetness, speaking extensively about family history, village history, and revolutionary struggle history, inspiring the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the masses to fight against the enemy with a common hatred. These old farmers love Chairman Mao and the socialist collective without limit, dare to break selfishness and establish public spirit, and play an important demonstration role in the masses' fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism. Many masses say: "We also want to be like the 'old strategists' and study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, criticize China's Khrushchev's various fallacies thoroughly, and eliminate the 'selfishness' in our minds."

    革命老农当参谋  革命青年打先锋
    海字村革命大批判队伍组织得好
    全村组成了十八个毛泽东思想学习小组，办起了许多家庭学习班，饲养员和车把式也组织起来参加大批判，老农们和贫下中农子女分别组成了“老参谋队”和文艺宣传队。家家户户，男女老少，运用各种形式，口诛笔伐，声讨中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人复辟资本主义的罪行。
    本报讯　北京市昌平县上庄公社海字大队新建立的革命“三结合”领导班子，坚定地依靠贫农下中农，开展革命大批判，把全大队农民群众广泛而深入地发动起来，投入肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义流毒的斗争，运动搞得热火朝天，生动活泼，冬季生产也搞得又快又好。
    最近两个月来，每到晚上，银山脚下的海字大队各生产队的队部，灯火通明，人们慷慨激昂地声讨中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。很多社员全家出动，少年儿童排队入场，年迈的老人坐在热炕上，青年们激情地唱起了《不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇》的歌曲。
    海字大队是一个山村。全村一百五十多户人家，组成了十八个毛泽东思想学习小组，学习毛主席著作，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。很多社员家庭也办起了学习班，老少同堂，一起斗私批修。村里的饲养员和车把式，过去由于日夜值班和流动性较大，被认为是不能坚持参加运动的“死角”，这次也分别组织起来，办起了大批判学习班。病人、老年人和家务繁重的女社员不能参加学习班活动，青少年便挨门串户，同他们一起回忆贫农下中农的血泪史，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的
  “三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、
  “物质刺激”等谬论。
    海字大队的革命大批判运动，为什么群众发动得既广泛又深入呢？新建立的领导班子负责人说：我们在解放军支农小组的帮助下，遵循毛主席“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”的教导，狠抓了两支队伍：一支是由贫农下中农的子女组成的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，另一支是由革命老农组成的“老参谋队”。这两支队伍相互紧密配合，把革命大批判的工作做“活”了。
    毛主席教导说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”为了推动革命大批判运动，海字村的三十二名贫农下中农子女组成了毛泽东思想文艺宣传队。他们利用土广播、黑板报和文艺演出，进行宣传鼓动工作。宣传队紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，结合本村的实际情况，先后演出了三十多场、九十多个节目。演出的题材主要是宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，揭露中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，而且把本村大批判中出现的新人新事搬上舞台，有效地调动了广大社员投入大批判的积极性。社员说：“看了宣传队的节目，真是心明眼亮”；“没想到中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋还想让我们再喝黄连水，我们坚决不答应！”广大贫农下中农对宣传队的评价是，“咱村的宣传队起到了团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的作用。”
    海字村小学的学生，在革命教师的领导下，根据毛主席“以学为主，……也要批判资产阶级”的教导，在复课闹革命以后，按照大队大批判的部署，先走一步，选学有关的毛主席著作和报纸上有关革命大批判的文章。他们向家长宣传革命大批判的重要意义，教唱革命歌曲，辅助老人读毛主席语录和大批判材料。这些少年儿童成为毛泽东思想文艺宣传队的得力助手。
    海字村是一个老解放区。从当年打游击、闹土改一直到合作化、公社化，都有一批革命老农担任基层领导职务。他们立场坚定，熟悉本村阶级斗争的历史，有联系群众的长处。海字大队新建立的领导班子十分重视这批革命老农的积极性，成立了一个七人的“老参谋队”。这支“老参谋队”，在革命大批判运动中，发挥了重要的作用。他们同大队领导班子一起分析本村阶级斗争的形势，制订大批判的计划。为了更好地肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，根据他们的建议，大队确定了以“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”为本村专题批判的重点。“老参谋队”的成员大都是老贫农下中农，苦大仇深，每人都有一部血泪史。他们在批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”“阶级斗争熄灭论”中，带头忆苦思甜，大讲家史、村史和革命斗争史，激励了广大贫农下中农和社员群众同仇敌忾的斗争意志。这些老农无限热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义集体，勇于破私立公，为广大社员斗私批修起了重要的示范作用。很多社员说：“我们也要象‘老参谋’那样活学活用毛主席著作，把中国赫鲁晓夫的各种谬论批臭批透，把我们头脑里的“私”字挖掉挖净。”
