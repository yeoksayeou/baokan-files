The broad masses of cadres and soldiers from the Guizhou Provincial Military Area's agricultural support front line are united with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in revolution, study, labor, and life. They work on production during the day and engage in revolution at night, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out a thorough revolution in their souls to promote ideological transformation.

The image shows soldiers from the People's Liberation Army on the agricultural support front line patiently teaching an old community member to read Chairman Mao's quotations during a rest from labor.

The personnel from the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionary workers and their families, bringing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the masses. This is a soldier from the People's Liberation Army propagating Chairman Mao's latest directives at a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the families of workers.

The militia and the People's Liberation Army support-left forces in Lingqiao Brigade, Lingqiao Commune, Chuansha County, Shanghai, form a military-civilian joint defense Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They use revolutionary cultural performances to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism, raise the socialist consciousness of the community members, and promote the in-depth development of the cultural revolution in rural areas.

A ship's voyage relies on the helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Dazhai Brigade's model worker Guo Fenglian and the active member of the militia studying Chairman Mao's works from Shanxi Province, Rong Gaigai, exchange experiences and insights on studying Chairman Mao's works.

The main leader of the Qingdao Steel Factory Revolutionary Committee, former worker from the seamless pipe workshop Huang Chengyun (third from the left), follows Chairman Mao's teachings, often goes deep among the masses, studies Chairman Mao's works with the workers, engages in self-criticism and criticizes revisionism, participates in production labor, maintains the character of the working class, and is deeply loved by revolutionary workers. This is Huang Chengyun returning to the seamless pipe workshop to work and discussing with the workers how to further improve the quality of seamless pipes.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasant community members in Xiaolan Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." With the surging momentum generated during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they achieved a bumper harvest of late rice in 1967. Look! The threshing floor is bustling with activity, and the community members are joyfully threshing the newly harvested rice.

Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolutionary thought, the revolutionary teachers and students of Tonghua No. 2 Middle School in Jilin Province are back in class and making revolution. The image shows revolutionary teachers and students criticizing the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The broad masses of community members in our cotton-producing areas have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great directive of "must grasp grain, must grasp cotton, must grasp cloth," achieving a bumper harvest of cotton in 1967. The image shows poor and lower-middle peasants in Tanghe County, Henan Province, enthusiastically selling new cotton.
