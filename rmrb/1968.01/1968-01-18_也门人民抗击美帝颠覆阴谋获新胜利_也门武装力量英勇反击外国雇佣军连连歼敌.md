The Yemeni people have recently achieved new victories in their heroic struggle against the U.S. imperialist plot to overthrow the Yemeni Republic through armed means.

Since the end of November last year, U.S. imperialism has openly instigated the Saudi Arabian reactionaries to support the Yemeni royalist forces, together with foreign mercenaries, to invade the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, in an attempt to realize their plot to overthrow the Yemeni Republic. This plot was quickly thwarted by the strong counterattack of the Yemeni government and people.

According to a broadcast by the Sana'a radio on the evening of the 15th, the Yemeni people launched a counterattack against the mercenaries and infiltrators in the northeastern region of Sana'a and, following up on their victory, annihilated more than 100 enemy soldiers, captured 20, and seized a batch of light and heavy weapons.

Another Sana'a radio report said that on the 15th, students of the Yemeni Military Academy annihilated a small group of mercenaries in combat. They seized a large number of American-made light and heavy weapons and ammunition, including one rocket launcher, one mortar, and one machine gun, as well as a large number of rifles.

The radio broadcast also said that when these prisoners and seized weapons were paraded through Sana'a, crowds of Yemeni people took to the streets, holding a grand demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Down with imperialism!" and "Down with the running dogs of imperialism!"

According to a recent statement by a Yemeni military spokesman, the Yemeni armed forces have achieved new victories in the war against the U.S. imperialist plot to overthrow the Yemeni Republic.

The spokesman said that the troops of the 10th Division guarding the western part of the capital, Sana'a, gave the mercenaries there a crushing blow, killing 46 mercenaries, wounding many, and capturing 16 alive.

He said that the Yemeni troops guarding the eastern part of Sana'a also recently won a battle. He said that the artillery, assault troops, and students of the Military Academy crushed the enemy's invasion activities, killing more than 150 mercenaries, and the rest were also wounded. None of the enemy escaped.

The spokesman said that among the enemy corpses, the bodies of Europeans were found, and some documents were also found. From the documents, it can be seen that the foreign mercenaries were executing orders and plans received from the Saudi Arabian government.

Recently, U.S. imperialism has instigated the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia to support the Yemeni royalist forces, together with foreign mercenaries, to invade the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, in an attempt to overthrow the Republican regime. However, this plot has been strongly countered by the Yemeni government and people.

    也门人民抗击美帝颠覆阴谋获新胜利
    也门武装力量英勇反击外国雇佣军连连歼敌
    据新华社萨那十五日电　也门人民最近在英勇地抗击美帝国主义阴谋武装颠覆也门共和政权的战斗中，取得了新的胜利。
    去年十一月底以来，美帝国主义公然唆使沙特阿拉伯反动派，支持也门王室势力，伙同外国雇佣军，窜犯也门首都萨那，以实现其颠覆也门共和政权的阴谋。这个阴谋在也门政府和也门人民的有力反击下很快遭到了挫败。
    据萨那电台十五日晚广播，也门人民向萨那东北地区的雇佣军和渗入者发动反击战，并乘胜跟踪追击，歼灭敌军一百多名，俘虏二十名，还缴获一批轻重武器。
    另一条萨那电台消息说，也门军事学院的学生十五日在同一小股雇佣军作战中，全部歼灭了雇佣军。他们缴获了大批美国制造的轻重武器和弹药，其中包括火箭炮、迫击炮和机关炮各一门以及大批步枪。
    电台广播还说，当这些俘虏和缴获的武器被押运到萨那时，成群结队的也门群众走上街头，举行盛大的示威游行。他们高呼：“打倒帝国主义！”
  “打倒帝国主义的走狗！”等口号。
    新华社萨那电　据也门军事发言人最近发表的一项声明，也门武装部队在反击美帝阴谋颠覆也门共和政权的战争中取得了新的胜利。
    这位发言人说，守卫在首都萨那西部的第十旅的军队给那里的部分雇佣军以迎头痛击，打死雇佣军四十六名，打伤多名，活捉十六名。
    他说，守卫在萨那东部的也门军队，最近也打了一场胜仗。他说，炮兵，突击队，军事学院的学生等粉碎了敌人的侵略活动，一举打死了一百五十多名雇佣军，其余的也都受了伤，敌人没有一个逃出去的。
    发言人说，在敌人尸体中发现了欧洲人的尸体，同时也发现一些证件，从证件中可以看出，外国雇佣军执行的是从沙特阿拉伯政府那里接受的命令和计划。
    最近以来，美帝国主义唆使沙特阿拉伯反动势力，支持也门王室势力伙同外国雇佣军，窜犯也门首都萨那，阴谋颠覆共和政权，但是，这个阴谋遭到了也门政府和人民的有力反击。
