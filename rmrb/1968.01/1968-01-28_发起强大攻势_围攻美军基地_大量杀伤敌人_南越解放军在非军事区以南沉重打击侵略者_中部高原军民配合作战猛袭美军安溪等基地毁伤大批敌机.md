The Liberation Army in South Vietnam launched a powerful offensive south of the demilitarized zone, inflicting heavy blows on the aggressors. The military and civilians in the Central Highlands coordinated their actions to launch a fierce attack on U.S. bases such as An Khe, destroying and damaging a large number of enemy aircraft.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, Saigon: On the 26th, the armed forces of South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on important U.S. bases in the demilitarized zone and the Central Highlands, leaving the U.S. aggressors in a state of disarray and panic.

On the 26th, the Liberation Army continued their sixth consecutive day of attacks on U.S. bases south of the demilitarized zone. In the early hours of the 26th, they launched a powerful artillery barrage on the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division headquarters at Phu Bai, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Simultaneously, the Liberation Army continued to launch fierce artillery attacks on the besieged U.S. base at Khe Sanh.

They also ambushed a U.S. Marine Corps convoy near Khe Sanh, destroying and damaging numerous vehicles. When U.S. forces from the Carol Camp attempted to reinforce, they were again attacked by the Liberation Army, resulting in many casualties.

The besieged U.S. aggressors were in a state of disarray, repeatedly calling for help from nearby U.S. bases and requesting air support. However, in the face of the Liberation Army's rich experience in jungle warfare, the U.S. "air superiority" had long been ineffective.

The Liberation Army, displaying unparalleled courage and tenacity in battle, inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. Their increasingly fierce and approaching artillery fire struck fear into the hearts of the U.S. troops in the base, making them jumpy and paranoid. The U.S. military leaders in Vietnam were extremely anxious about the Liberation Army's powerful offensive, exclaiming that the 5,000 U.S. troops besieged in Khe Sanh were in a "very weak position."

Due to the Liberation Army's powerful offensive south of the demilitarized zone and their fierce siege of the Khe Sanh base, the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, secretly flew to Khe Sanh in a helicopter on the 25th to boost the morale of the beleaguered U.S. troops. However, fearing the Liberation Army's artillery attacks, he stayed in the base for only a few minutes before secretly leaving.

Since the Liberation Army launched fierce attacks south of the demilitarized zone on the 21st, the U.S. military leaders in Vietnam were in a state of panic, having to divert nearly 10,000 troops, including a regiment from the 1st Cavalry Division, from the Central Highlands to reinforce the area.

Seizing this opportunity, the Liberation Army in the Central Highlands launched fierce attacks on important U.S. bases. On the morning of the 26th, the Liberation Army launched a fierce artillery barrage on the 1st Cavalry Division's An Khe base. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Liberation Army soldiers breached the base's defenses, destroying and damaging many enemy aircraft. Simultaneously, the Liberation Army also launched a fierce attack on the U.S. base at Pleiku, using explosives to destroy the runway and many enemy aircraft.

The armed forces of South Vietnam have rapidly developed and grown stronger in the war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The image shows a heroic unit forged in the fires of war. (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter)

    发起强大攻势　围攻美军基地　大量杀伤敌人
    南越解放军在非军事区以南沉重打击侵略者
    中部高原军民配合作战猛袭美军安溪等基地毁伤大批敌机
    据新华社二十六日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十六日在非军事区以南和中部高原对美军重要基地进行了猛烈的攻击，打得美国侵略军捉襟见肘、狼狈不堪。
    人民解放武装力量二十六日接连第六天对非军事区以南的美军基地，展开了猛烈的袭击。他们在二十六日凌晨以强大的炮火，轰击了美国海军陆战队第三师总部的芙拜基地，给予敌人重大的杀伤。同时，人民解放武装力量继续猛烈炮击被包围的美军溪星基地。
    他们还在溪星基地的附近伏击了美国海军陆战队的一个车队，击毁击伤了许多车辆。当卡罗尔营地的美军前往增援时，又遭到了人民解放武装力量的袭击，被打死打伤很多人。
    被包围的美国侵略军被打得狼狈不堪，不断向周围基地的美军呼救要求空中支援。但是在富有丛林区作战经验的人民解放武装力量面前，美国的“空中优势”早已失灵。
    在战斗中表现无比英勇顽强的人民解放武装力量给予敌人的沉重打击，以及他们越来越猛烈和逼近的炮火，吓得基地里的美军心惊胆战、草木皆兵。侵越美军头目对人民解放武装力量的强大攻势非常惊慌不安，惊呼已被包围在溪星基地内的五千名美军“地位非常软弱”。
    由于人民解放武装力量在非军事区以南发起强大攻势和对美军溪星基地发起猛烈围攻，侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰在二十五日偷偷地乘直升飞机到溪星基地，给被打得焦头烂额的美国侵略军打气。但是他又害怕人民解放武装力量炮火的袭击，在基地里只呆了几分钟就偷偷地溜走。
    人民解放武装力量从二十一日在非军事区以南发起猛烈攻击后，侵越美军头目非常惊慌，不得不剜肉补疮，从中部战场抽调了包括第一骑兵师的一个旅在内的近一万人兵力到非军事区以南去增援。
    中部高原的人民解放武装力量抓住这大好时机，对美军的重要基地展开了猛烈的攻击。二十六日清晨，人民解放武装力量对第一骑兵师的安溪基地进行了猛烈的炮击。解放军战士们在炮火的掩护下，突破了基地的防御工事，击毁击伤了很多敌机。同时，人民解放武装力量还对波来古附近美军霍洛威基地进行了猛烈的袭击，用炸药炸毁了机场的跑道和很多敌机。（附图片）
