In 1967, on the battlefield of Vietnam, the heroic Vietnamese people fought the U.S. imperialists to a point where they were at their wits' end and in a state of utter disarray. At home and abroad, the U.S. imperialists faced unprecedented severe difficulties.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The various irreconcilable contradictions within and without the United States are like a volcano, threatening the U.S. imperialists every day. The U.S. imperialists are sitting on this volcano."

The aggression against Vietnam is an extremely important component of the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy. It is also a desperate struggle by the U.S. imperialists to escape the various crises they face at home and abroad. In this war of aggression, the U.S. imperialists have exhausted all their tricks and are at their wits' end. The inherent contradictions of U.S. imperialism and the various crises it faces have reached an unprecedented level of intensity, further dooming its counter-revolutionary global strategy to failure.

Insufficient Troops, Exhausted Reserves

Currently, one of the most prominent and insurmountable contradictions facing the U.S. imperialists is that casualties are increasing on the battlefield, while reserves are becoming increasingly depleted, making it more difficult to recruit soldiers. Over the past few years, in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war, more than twenty thousand of the U.S. imperialists' fighting forces have been annihilated. The reinforcements they can send are becoming increasingly difficult to make up for the massive casualties on the battlefield. The fatal strategic weakness of the U.S. imperialists' insufficient troops has been fully exposed. The current U.S. troops are far from enough to meet their needs for aggression in various parts of the world and for maintaining fascist rule at home. Therefore, despite the repeated urgent requests for reinforcements from the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, to Washington, the Johnson administration can only patch things up here and there, far from meeting the demands. This fully reflects the U.S. imperialists' desperate situation of exhausted manpower and financial strain. While the U.S. imperialists are stepping up the recruitment of cannon fodder at home, this will only ignite a higher wave of anti-war and anti-draft struggles among the American people.

Financial Exhaustion, Economic Deterioration

In terms of finance and economy, the war in Vietnam is like an endless abyss that consumes the limited financial resources of the U.S. imperialists to an extremely difficult extent, heavily striking the already riddled U.S. economy. According to the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the U.S. budget deficit may reach an unprecedented high of $35 billion, a figure roughly equivalent to the expenditure of the war in Vietnam for this fiscal year. At the same time, the war in Vietnam has caused U.S. foreign exchange expenditures to continue to increase, resulting in an even larger trade deficit, further shaking the already precarious position of the U.S. dollar. For many years, the U.S. has relied on issuing public debt, increasing taxes, and printing money to temporarily fill the gap. However, the excessive issuance of money is accelerating inflation and price increases. In this situation, the U.S. government's room for maneuver to ease the financial crisis is already very limited, and it is increasingly in a dilemma. The continuation of the war in Vietnam can only accelerate the deterioration of the U.S. financial and trade situation. This is another contradiction that the U.S. imperialists, who insist on expanding the war in Vietnam, cannot solve.

People's Opposition, Surrounded on All Sides

The unjust nature of the war in Vietnam and the various heavy burdens and impacts it has brought to the American people have intensified class contradictions within the U.S., promoting the awakening of the broad masses of the American people. Last year, the broad masses of the American people and youth's struggle against the war in Vietnam and against conscription was fierce, reaching an unprecedented high level. The long-suffering black working people, who have been subjected to class oppression and racial persecution, have been deeply harmed by the policy of aggression in Vietnam. Last year, they launched large-scale armed anti-violence struggles in more than a hundred large and small cities in the U.S., the scope of which, the duration, and the intensity of the struggle were all unprecedented in U.S. history. At the same time, under the heavy pressure of increased taxes and rising prices, the development of workers' strikes in the U.S. has reached its highest peak since the U.S. aggression in Korea. The all-around surge in the people's movement in the U.S. has made the U.S. imperialists, who have suffered repeated defeats on the battlefield in Vietnam, also suffer a heavy blow from the people's struggle at home, falling into a predicament of being attacked from both inside and outside. The U.S. monopoly capitalist press anxiously cries out: "Now the U.S. is in a time of turmoil."

A Rat Crossing the Street, Everyone Shouts to Kill It

The victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has disrupted the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment, powerfully supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries; the people of various countries have also supported the Vietnamese people through their own struggles, especially the armed struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists. In the past year, the worldwide tide of struggle against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam has surged even more powerfully. In various parts of the world, large-scale mass demonstrations against U.S. aggression in Vietnam have broken out one after another. On the five continents, the angry shouts of "Johnson is a murderer," "Yankees go home from Vietnam," and the slogans of "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people" and "Support the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam" have resounded everywhere. In some capitalist countries, angry demonstrators have broken through the heavy obstacles of reactionary police, smashing the doors and windows of U.S. overseas institutions. The U.S. imperialists have fallen into the encirclement of the people of the world, becoming a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts to kill.

Internal Strife, Betrayal from Within

Under the pressure of various crises and contradictions, the days of the U.S. imperialists are more difficult than ever. The disputes within the ruling clique and the contradictions between the U.S. and its "allies" and vassals have also intensified. Last year, the disputes within the U.S. ruling clique over the methods of implementing the policy of aggression in Vietnam reached an unprecedented level of intensity. In particular, due to the upcoming presidential election this year, the various factions within the ruling clique have become like a group of desperate, struggling mad dogs, arguing with each other incessantly. As the number one representative of U.S. imperialism, Johnson himself is in a very awkward and isolated position. At the same time, some of the U.S.'s "allies," seeing that the U.S. is mired in the quagmire of the war in Vietnam and unable to extricate itself, have taken the opportunity to challenge the U.S. from various angles. Some have even refused to provide actual support for the U.S. war in Vietnam, despite the U.S. repeatedly sending envoys to persuade them, due to their dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s hegemonic position and fear of being drawn into the war in Vietnam. Even for a few vassals of the war in Vietnam, due to their own difficulties, the U.S. imperialists find it difficult to control them at will.

Facing the miserable situation of being besieged from both inside and outside, the U.S. imperialists are making their last desperate struggles. However, the U.S. imperialists' last desperate struggles will not only fail to reverse their defeat in Vietnam but will also further deepen their various contradictions and crises, accelerating their doom. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The reactionary forces of the United States have already hit a wall everywhere, showing that their days are numbered."

    美帝在侵越战争死胡同中垂死挣扎
    一九六七年，在越南战场上被英雄的越南人民打得走投无路、狼狈不堪的美帝国主义，在国内外陷入了空前严重的困难处境。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    侵越战争是美帝国主义的反革命全球战略的一个极为重要的组成部分，也是美帝国主义为了摆脱它在国内外面临的各种危机而进行的拚死的挣扎。美帝国主义在这场侵略战争中已经黔驴技穷，走投无路。美帝国主义固有的一系列矛盾和面临的各种危机空前地激化了，它的反革命全球战略进一步破产了。
    兵力不足　后备枯竭
    目前，摆在美帝国主义面前的一个不可克服的突出的矛盾是：战场上伤亡激增，而后备却越来越枯竭，征兵越来越困难。几年来，在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中，美帝国主义的有生力量已经被歼灭二十多万，它所能增派的兵力越来越难以弥补战场上的巨大伤亡。美帝兵力不足的致命战略弱点已经暴露无遗。美帝现有的兵力根本应付不了它在世界各地进行侵略和在国内维护法西斯统治的需要。因此，尽管侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰多次向华盛顿告急求援，约翰逊政府却只能东拼西凑，挖肉补疮，远远满足不了要求。这充分反映了美帝兵源枯竭、捉襟见肘的窘状。而美帝在国内加紧搜罗炮灰，结果又将激起美国人民反侵越、反征兵斗争的更高的浪潮。
    财力消耗　经济恶化
    在财政经济方面，侵越战争象一个永远填不满的无底洞，把美帝国主义的有限的财力消耗到十分窘迫的程度，沉重地打击着千疮百孔的美国经济。据美帝头子约翰逊透露，在到今年六月三十日为止的财政年度内，美国的预算赤字可能达到三百五十亿美元的空前高峰，这个数字大约相当于这一财政年度内侵越战争的开支。与此同时，侵越战争使美国的外汇开支不断增加，从而使国际收支出现更大的逆差，进一步动摇着美元的岌岌可危的地位。多年来，美国一直靠增发公债、增加税收和增发钞票等办法来暂时弥补亏空。而滥发钞票正在加速通货膨胀和物价上涨。在这种情况下，美国政府缓和财政危机的活动余地已经不大，越来越陷入进退维谷的境地。侵越战争的继续进行只能使美国的财政和国际收支状况加速恶化。这又是坚持扩大侵越战争的美帝国主义所无法解决的一个矛盾。
    人民反对　四面楚歌
    侵越战争的非正义性质以及它给美国人民带来的各种沉重负担和影响，加剧了美国国内的阶级矛盾，促进了广大美国人民的觉醒。去年，广大美国人民和青年反对侵越战争、反对征兵的斗争，如火如荼，出现了空前高涨的局面。长期遭受阶级压迫和种族迫害的美国黑人劳苦大众，深受侵越政策之害，去年在一百多个美国大小城市先后掀起了大规模的武装抗暴斗争，其波及范围之广，持续时间之长，斗争情况之激烈，都是美国历史上空前的。同时，在税收增加、物价高涨的重压下，美国工人罢工斗争的发展也达到了美国侵朝战争以来的最高峰。美国人民运动的全面高涨，使得在越南战场上连遭惨败的美帝国主义，在国内人民斗争这条战线上也受到十分沉重的打击，陷入内外夹攻、腹背受敌的窘境。美国垄断资产阶级报刊不安地叫嚷：现在美国国内“处于动乱的时代”。
    过街老鼠　人人喊打
    越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利打乱了美帝国主义的反革命全球战略部署，有力地支援了各国人民的革命斗争；各国人民也通过自己的斗争，特别是亚非拉人民的武装斗争，有力地支援着越南人民，沉重地打击着美帝国主义。在过去的一年中，全世界人民反对美帝侵越战争的斗争浪潮更加汹涌澎湃。在世界各地，不断地爆发反对美国侵略越南的大规模群众示威，五大洲到处发出“约翰逊是杀人犯”、“美国佬从越南滚出去”的怒吼声，到处打出了“越南是越南人民的”、“支持越南南方民族解放阵线”的标语。在一些资本主义国家里，愤怒的示威群众冲破了反动警察的重重阻挠，砸毁了美国驻外机构的门窗。美帝国主义已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。
    内部争吵　众叛亲离
    在各种危机和矛盾交相煎迫的情况下，美帝国主义的日子空前难熬，统治集团内部的争吵以及美国同它的“盟国”和仆从的矛盾，也都随之越演越烈。去年，美国统治集团内部围绕贯彻侵越政策方法的吵闹，达到了前所未有的激烈程度。特别是由于面临今年的总统选举，统治集团内各色人等，就更象一群绝望挣扎的疯狗，彼此争吵不休。作为美帝国主义头号代表人物的约翰逊本人，陷入十分困窘和孤立的处境。在这同时，美国的一些“盟国”看到美国深陷在侵越的泥潭中无力自拔，有的趁机从各方面向美国挑战，有的则由于对美国的霸权地位不满和害怕自己被卷入侵越战争，甚至在美国派出要员一再游说的情况下，也拒绝对美国侵越战争给予实际的支持。就是对少数几个侵越仆从，由于它们自身难保，美帝国主义也很难得心应手地任意驱使了。
    面对内外交困的凄惨景况，美帝国主义者正在进行垂死挣扎。但是，美帝国主义的这种垂死挣扎不但不能挽回它的侵越败局，而且必将进一步加深它自己各方面的矛盾和危机，加速它的末日的到来。正如毛主席所指出的：“美国反动势力现已到处碰壁，显示着他们的寿命不会很长了。”　（据新华社）
