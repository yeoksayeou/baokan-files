In 1967, the broad masses of workers on Albania's transportation front, in the revolutionization movement, displayed high production enthusiasm and achieved outstanding results in completing the year's transportation plan.

Since last year, the workers on Albania's transportation front, inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha's important speech on February 6, have emphasized proletarian politics and put forward many revolutionary initiatives in their work, thereby greatly promoting the development of the transportation industry.

Albania's road freight plan for last year is expected to be completed at 108 percent, railway freight at 106 percent, inland waterway freight at 107 percent, and ocean freight at 122 percent. The passenger transportation plan is also expected to be overfulfilled.

To implement the directives of the Fifth Congress of the Party and better serve production and the people, the transportation sector has taken many measures to improve urban and rural transportation conditions. Last year, new road transportation lines were opened in Lushnje, Pogradec, Laci, and Vore, and the road networks in Kukes, Pukë, Skrapar, and Shkodër were developed.

The broad masses of workers in the transportation sector have also carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, taking the initiative to overcome various difficulties and manufacturing automobile parts and some technically complex telecommunications equipment that were previously imported. The technical personnel at the port of Durres designed and manufactured a five-ton electric crane. Transportation companies in Tirana and other places have built new repair workshops to repair cars and manufacture small parts. In addition, the workers have launched campaigns to save fuel, tires, maintain transportation tools, and extend the service life of cars.

Albania's transportation industry is continuously developing. The picture shows a corner of the port of Durres.

    阿交通运输战线取得出色成就
    新华社地拉那电　一九六七年，阿尔巴尼亚交通运输战线上的广大职工在革命化运动中发挥了高度的生产热情，在完成这一年的运输计划中取得了出色的成就。
    去年以来，阿尔巴尼亚交通运输战线上的职工在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议和恩维尔·霍查同志二月六日的重要讲话的鼓舞下，大力突出无产阶级政治，在劳动中提出了许多革命化的倡议，有力地促进了交通运输事业的发展。
    阿尔巴尼亚去年公路货运计划预计将完成百分之一百零八，铁路货运——百分之一百零六，内河货运——百分之一百零七，远洋货运——百分之一百二十二，客运计划也将超额完成。
    为了贯彻劳动党五大指示，更好地为生产和人民服务，交通部门采取了许多措施，改善城乡交通条件。去年，在卢什涅、波格拉迪茨、拉契、沃德耶等地开辟了新的公路运输线，发展了库克斯、普克、斯克拉巴里和斯库台等山区的公路网。
    交通运输部门的广大职工还发扬自力更生的革命精神，自己动手，克服各种困难，制造出过去需要进口的汽车零件和一些技术复杂的电讯器材。都拉斯港口的技术人员自己设计和制造出起重能力五吨的电力起重机。地拉那等地的运输公司新建了修配车间，修理汽车和制造小型零件。此外，职工们还开展了节约燃料、轮胎，保养交通运输工具和延长汽车使用期限等运动。（附图片）
