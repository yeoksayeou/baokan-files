The People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region, while deeply engaging in the campaign to learn from the "Model Leftist and Model Soldier" Fourth Platoon and Li Wentong, has launched a widespread and profound wave of love for the people. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers regard arming the people with Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest act of love for the people. They have organized over a thousand Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which have gone deep into urban neighborhoods, extensively promoting Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the residents. This has greatly promoted the mass movement of residents actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and has advanced the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of residents.

In the course of their activities in the neighborhoods, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have, in every respect, taken the Fourth Platoon and Li Wentong as their examples, placing the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in a position that is greater than everything, prior to everything, higher than everything, and more important than everything. Wherever they go, they create a thick atmosphere of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The residents in the neighborhoods are mostly elderly, children, and housewives. Due to household chores, many of them cannot find the time to participate in study sessions. Some, influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, cannot sit together. Facing these situations, the cadres and soldiers personally go into the residents' courtyards and homes, promoting Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them, doing painstaking and meticulous ideological work, and helping them to properly arrange their household chores. They establish study classes suitable for neighborhood residents to participate in, so that more elderly people and housewives can join in the study. The cadres and soldiers say: As long as we can let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every inch of land and guide every household, we are willing to endure any hardship.

In their promotions, the cadres and soldiers repeatedly promote Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the residents, guiding them to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focusing on the implementation. They strive to be like Li Wentong, doing "what Chairman Mao loves, I love; what Chairman Mao supports, I support; what Chairman Mao instructs, I follow; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward." Some housewives, who in the past were more concerned with their families and less with study, rarely participated in social activities, and had more "self" in their minds. When dealing with problems and viewing things, they often confined themselves to the small circle of family and personal interests. The cadres and soldiers help them to study Chairman Mao's works with their problems in mind, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and fundamentally raise their consciousness. Qin Hongwen, a housewife, whose husband is a truck driver, had difficulties understanding the situation during the early days of the Cultural Revolution when the masses posted big-character posters on him. Qin Hongwen's thoughts were not clear, and she pulled her husband back, not letting him be a cadre. The propaganda team, upon learning of this situation, studied Chairman Mao's works "Old Three Articles" and his latest instructions with her, learned from the deeds of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wentong, and together carried out self-criticism and criticism of Liu Shaoqi, helping her to raise her consciousness. Qin Hongwen actively supported her husband's work and took the initiative to help her husband carry out self-criticism and criticism, bravely standing in the ranks of the masses' struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "We should deeply pay attention to the people's livelihood issues, from land and labor issues to issues of firewood, rice, oil, and salt." The cadres and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, while vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly help the people solve various difficulties. Many people, while grasping the revolution and promoting production, work selflessly, neglecting their household chores. The cadres and soldiers enthusiastically help these people repair walls, dig kangs (traditional heated beds), carry water, sweep courtyards, and arrange household chores; for those who are sick, they send medical personnel to treat them. Over sixty-year-old Li Grandma's son and daughter both work outside, leaving her alone at home. Wei Sufang from the propaganda team often visits her. When Li Grandma's home ran out of coal, Wei Sufang borrowed a small cart to help her buy coal. Li Grandma, with tears in her eyes, looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, the river is not as deep as the affection of the PLA for us."

In the course of their activities of loving the people, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, like Li Wentong, humbly learn from the people, and sincerely become the people's little students. They ask the elderly to recall the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, ask the neighborhood activists who study Chairman Mao's works to give reports on self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, widely learn good thoughts, good experiences, and good styles from the people, greatly enhancing their deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the army, and strengthening the ideological revolutionization construction.

    沈阳部队派出一千多个宣传队宣传毛主席最新指示
    用毛泽东思想武装群众是最大的爱民
    大大推动街道居民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进了居民的思想革命化
    据新华社沈阳七日电　人民解放军沈阳部队在深入开展向“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志学习活动中，掀起广泛深入的爱民热潮。广大指战员把用毛泽东思想武装群众看作是最大的爱民。他们组成一千多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到城镇街道，广泛向居民宣传毛主席最新指示，大大推动了街道居民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进了广大居民的思想革命化。
    广大指战员在深入街道开展爱民活动时，处处以英雄四排和李文忠同志为榜样，把宣传毛泽东思想放在大于一切、先于一切、高于一切、重于一切的地位。住在那里，就把活学活用毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的。街道居民多是老人、小孩和家庭妇女，由于家务牵连，许多人抽不出身来参加学习，有的因受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，坐不到一块。针对这些情况，指战员们便亲自深入到居民的院里和家里，向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示，做艰苦细致的思想工作，并帮助他们妥善安排好家务，因地制宜办好适合街道居民参加的学习班，使更多的老人和家庭妇女能够参加学习。指战员们说：只要能让毛泽东思想占领每一寸土地，统帅每一个家庭，我们再劳累也心甘情愿。
    在宣传中，指战员们针对居民存在的各种现实活思想，反复宣传毛主席的最新指示，扎扎实实地引导居民活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，象李文忠同志那样，做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”有的家庭妇女，过去顾家多，学习少，很少参加社会活动，脑子里“私”字较多。处理问题，看待事物往往局限在家庭和个人的小圈子里。指战员们就帮助她们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，开展斗私批修，从根本上提高觉悟。家庭妇女秦红文的丈夫是汽车队长，文化大革命初期群众给他贴了一些大字报，秦红文思想不通，就扯丈夫的后腿，不让他当干部。宣传队了解到这个情况，就和她一起学习毛主席的光辉著作
  “老三篇”和最新指示，学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的事迹，一起破私立公，批判中国赫鲁晓夫，使她提高了认识。秦红文积极支持丈夫的工作，并主动帮助丈夫斗私批修，勇敢地站到群众斗争的行列中。
    毛主席说：“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。”指战员们遵照毛主席的教导，在大力宣传毛泽东思想的同时，满腔热情地帮助人民群众解决各种困难。许多群众抓革命、促生产，忘我地工作，家务事顾不上管。他们就热情帮助这些群众修墙掏炕、挑水扫院，安排家务；有些群众生病，就派出医务人员治疗。六十多岁的李大娘儿子女儿都在外面工作，独身一人在家，宣传队的魏素芳经常去探望。大娘家缺煤烧，她就借小推车帮助大娘买煤。李大娘热泪盈眶地望着毛主席像激动地说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如解放军对俺们感情深。”
    在爱民活动中，广大指战员还象李文忠同志那样，虚心地向人民群众学习，老老实实地做群众的小学生。他们请老人忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜，请街道学习毛主席著作积极分子作斗私批修报告，广泛向群众学习好思想、好经验、好作风，大大增强了对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，推动了部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，加强了思想革命化建设。
