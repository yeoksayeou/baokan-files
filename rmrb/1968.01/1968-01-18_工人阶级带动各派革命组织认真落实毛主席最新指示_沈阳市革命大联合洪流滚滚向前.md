The working class in Shenyang, a major industrial base in China, is closely following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao. With the help of the Shenyang garrison, they are taking practical actions to achieve great unity in the revolution and implement Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions. Under the leadership of the working class, the tide of great unity in the revolution in Shenyang is surging forward, rapidly forming a high tide.

Chairman Mao's scientific foresight, as pointed out during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, that "in a few more months, the overall situation will become even better," has already become a reality in Shenyang.

The brilliant year of 1968 has just begun, and the streets of Shenyang are filled with the sound of drums and gongs every day. The teams reporting the achievement of revolutionary great unity have grown from a few to several dozen each day. The gates of the Shenyang garrison leadership are crowded with units coming to report their successes. In just half a month, more than 480 factories, railways, schools, offices, hospitals, theater troupes, and suburban communes in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity; many more units are in the process of discussing and achieving revolutionary great unity.

The great thought of Mao Zedong and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are the extremely powerful driving force behind the rapid development of revolutionary great unity in Shenyang. In recent months, various revolutionary mass organizations in Shenyang's factories, schools, offices, and shops have all held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The leaders and cadres of the revolutionary mass organizations, as well as the revolutionary masses from various factions, have all participated in the study. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions:

"Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Through the study, everyone's consciousness has been raised, and their eyes have been opened. They have recalled the bitter and sweet experiences of the past year and a half of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and clearly seen that it was the revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party that split their class brothers into several factions. They deeply realize that in order to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class has a thousand reasons and ten thousand reasons to unite, but no reason to continue splitting. Many factories' revolutionary factions have made self-criticisms, overthrown bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, eliminated opposing sentiments, and achieved revolutionary great unity.

In the high tide of achieving revolutionary great unity, many factories' revolutionary mass organizations have seen a new situation where leaders lead the masses, the masses urge the leaders, and everyone strives to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." They say that achieving revolutionary great unity is the key to deepening the revolutionary criticism, achieving the three-in-one combination, doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If you do not promote revolutionary great unity, you will inevitably become an obstacle to it. In some factories, the leaders of several revolutionary mass organizations just sat down to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and discuss achieving revolutionary great unity, while some workshops and sections of the revolutionary masses had already eagerly achieved revolutionary great unity. Seeing that the masses had already gone ahead, the leaders also dispelled their worries about the masses not understanding or complaining, and quickly reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary great unity in the entire factory.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sent by the Shenyang garrison to many factories and enterprises have played a significant role in promoting the achievement of revolutionary great unity in these enterprises. They helped the several revolutionary mass organizations to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with the revolutionary masses, they actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They seriously carried out Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The two sides should talk less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak for themselves, and each side should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." After "each side doing more self-criticism," many factory mass organizations increased their mutual understanding, quickly dispelled opposing sentiments, and laid a foundation for achieving revolutionary great unity. The various Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of the garrison, in order to quickly promote the achievement of revolutionary great unity among the various revolutionary mass organizations, also used the New Year holiday to visit the homes of more than 12,000 leaders and members of revolutionary mass organizations to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, arming them with the great thought of Mao Zedong, and promoting the development of revolutionary great unity.

Many revolutionary workers in Shenyang's factories, while quickly achieving revolutionary great unity in their units, are also doing everything possible to contribute to the promotion of revolutionary great unity in other departments, systems, and throughout the city. Under the leadership of the working class, the Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Shenyang have also joined the tide of revolutionary great unity. Many schools, offices, hospitals, and theater troupes have quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. In all units that have achieved revolutionary great unity, revolution, production, and work have entered a new phase, and the situation is getting better and better.

    工人阶级带动各派革命组织认真落实毛主席最新指示
    沈阳市革命大联合洪流滚滚向前
    据新华社沈阳十七日电　我国重工业基地沈阳市的广大工人阶级，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署，在沈阳驻军的帮助下，以实现革命大联合的实际行动，落实毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示。在工人阶级的带动下，目前沈阳市革命大联合的洪流汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前，正在迅速形成高潮。
    毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时所指出的
  “再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好”的科学预见，已经在沈阳成为现实。
    光辉灿烂的一九六八年刚一开始，沈阳街头就终日锣鼓喧天，实现革命大联合的报喜队，从最初的每天几起、十几起，迅猛地发展到每天几十起。沈阳驻军领导机关门前，前来报喜的单位络绎不绝。在短短半个月的时间里，全市已经有工厂、铁路、学校、机关、医院、剧团、郊区公社等四百八十多个单位实现了革命的大联合；还有更多的单位正在酝酿、协商实现革命的大联合。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，毛主席的一系列最新指示，是推动沈阳市革命大联合迅猛发展的无比强大的动力。近几个月来，沈阳市工厂、学校、机关、商店的各派革命群众组织，都大办了毛泽东思想学习班。革命群众组织的负责人和骨干以及各派的革命群众，普遍参加了学习。他们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：
  “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”经过学习，大家提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛。他们通过忆苦思甜，回忆一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，清楚地看到是中国赫鲁晓夫和党内最大的一小撮走资派所推行的资产阶级反动路线，把自己的阶级兄弟分裂成为几派。他们深刻地认识到：为了全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，工人阶级有一千条理由、一万条理由联合起来，而没有半点理由继续分裂下去。许多工厂的革命派各自做了自我批评，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，消除了对立情绪，实现了革命大联合。
    在实现革命大联合的高潮中，许多工厂的革命群众组织，出现了头头带群众，群众促头头，你追我赶，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，落实毛主席最新指示的新局面。他们说，实现革命大联合，是深入开展革命大批判，实现革命三结合，搞好本单位斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键，你不做革命大联合的促进派，就必然成为革命大联合的绊脚石。有的工厂几派革命群众组织的负责人，刚刚坐在一块学习毛主席的最新指示，商谈实现革命大联合，下面一些班组、科室的革命群众已经迫不及待地实现了革命大联合。头头们眼看群众已经跑到自己的前头去了，也就打消了怕群众不理解、怕群众埋怨的顾虑，很快达成了实现全厂革命大联合的协议。
    沈阳驻军派到许多工厂企业的毛泽东思想宣传队，在促进工厂企业实现革命大联合中发挥了巨大的作用。他们帮助几派革命群众组织合办毛泽东思想学习班，同革命群众一起活学活用毛主席的“老五篇”和落实毛主席的最新指示，认真贯彻执行毛主席的这一伟大教导：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”许多工厂的群众组织在“各自多做自我批评”以后，增进了相互了解，迅速打消了对立情绪，为实现革命大联合打下了思想基础。驻军各毛泽东思想宣传队为了尽快地促进各派革命群众组织实现革命大联合，还利用新年假日，深入到一万二千多名革命群众组织负责人和革命群众的家里去访问，宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，用伟大的毛泽东思想去武装他们，促进了革命大联合的发展。
    沈阳市许多工厂的革命职工，在尽快实现本单位革命大联合的同时，还千方百计地为促进沈阳市其他部门、其他系统和全市的革命大联合贡献力量。在工人阶级的带动下，沈阳市的红卫兵小将、革命干部、革命知识分子也卷进了革命大联合的洪流。不少学校、机关、医院、剧团等，很快地实现了革命的大联合。凡是已经实现革命大联合的单位，革命、生产和工作都出现了新局面，而且形势越来越好。
