The dollar is in critical condition, the U.S. empire faces hard times. Johnson is forced to take "emergency measures" to save the dollar.

BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- As the revolutionary people around the world joyfully welcome the new year, the U.S. imperialists are facing unprecedented difficulties. On New Year's Day, U.S. President Johnson, with a gloomy face, announced a series of "emergency measures" to save the dollar, attempting to prolong the life of the dollar, which is already in critical condition.

This was announced by Johnson at a press conference held at his ranch in Texas on January 1. The "emergency measures" include: "mandatory" restrictions on U.S. private direct investments overseas, limiting U.S. bank loans abroad, restricting U.S. private travel overseas, reducing government overseas military expenditures and "aid" to foreign countries, and increasing exports. In his speech, Johnson also hinted that he would ask Congress to abolish the requirement that U.S. currency be backed by 25% gold reserves, so that all of America's gold reserves can be used to cope with possible bank runs. After the press conference, Johnson immediately sent Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach and Rostow to Europe and Asia respectively to lobby, attempting to "persuade" America's so-called "allies" to share the burden of U.S. military expenditures and open their markets to U.S. goods.

The U.S. government's "emergency measures" were taken in response to the severe deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments and the precarious situation of the dollar. It fully reflects the U.S. imperialists' crisis-ridden and desperate situation. According to Johnson, due to the expansion of the Vietnam War and increased overseas expenditures, the U.S. balance of payments deficit in 1967 is estimated to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion, nearly three times the deficit of the previous year and the highest in seven years. This situation poses a fatal threat to the dollar, which has been under increasing pressure since the devaluation of the British pound and is now in an unprecedentedly weak position. Western news agencies pointed out that Johnson, disregarding the possibility of losing votes in this year's presidential election, decided to take these "drastic measures" and hurriedly announced them on New Year's Day, which precisely proves the dollar's desperate and precarious situation. The New York Times acknowledged in its commentary that these "emergency measures" seem to be taken by the U.S. government "in an unpleasant and unanticipated forced situation."

The news indicates that Johnson was forced to announce these measures as a result of deepening contradictions within the imperialist camp, especially the strong pressure exerted by Western European countries on the United States. These countries have made it clear to the United States that if the United States does not take serious action to "improve" its balance of payments, they will refuse to support the dollar. In the "emergency measures," the United States decided to change the restriction on private direct investments overseas from "voluntary" compliance over the past few years to "mandatory" implementation, which specifically reflects the concessions the United States was forced to make under pressure. Private direct investments overseas have always been an important means for U.S. monopolies to seize overseas markets and carry out economic aggression, earning them an annual "profit" of $4 billion to $5 billion. Naturally, the U.S. imperialists are not willing to give up easily. Therefore, for several years, although there was a nominal "voluntary" restriction, in reality, large amounts of U.S. capital continued to flow overseas each year, with Western European countries being an important target for U.S. capital exports. This situation has caused increasing dissatisfaction among Western European countries. It is precisely because of the opposition from these countries that the United States was forced to announce a suspension of new investments in the entire European continent this time.

In the face of the accelerating decline and disintegration of the entire imperialist camp, the U.S. imperialists' attempt to get out of the predicament through the aforementioned so-called "emergency measures" is completely a futile fantasy. These measures will not only fail to save the dollar, which is in a precarious situation, nor will they alleviate the deepening contradictions among imperialists, but will further exacerbate the crises in various aspects of the United States.

### 美元病入膏肓　美帝日子难熬  约翰逊被迫采取“紧急措施”挽救美元

    美元病入膏肓　美帝日子难熬
    约翰逊被迫采取“紧急措施”挽救美元
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：正当全世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接新的一年的时候，美帝国主义的日子空前难熬，美帝头子约翰逊在元旦这一天愁眉苦脸地宣布采取一系列“紧急措施”挽救美元，妄图使早已病入膏肓的美元继续苟延残喘。
    这是约翰逊一日在得克萨斯州牧场举行的记者招待会上宣布的。“紧急措施”的内容包括：“强制性”限制美国私人在海外的直接投资、限制美国银行的国外贷款、限制美国私人在国外的旅行、削减政府的海外驻军费用和“援”外开支、加紧扩大出口等。约翰逊在讲话中还暗示，他将要求国会取消美钞应有百分之二十五的黄金作为后备的规定，以便使美国的全部黄金储备都可动用来应付可能发生的挤兑风潮。在招待会后，约翰逊立即派出副国务卿卡曾巴赫和罗斯托分别前往西欧和亚洲进行游说，妄图“说服”美国的所谓“盟国”为美国分担驻军开支和为美国商品的倾销敞开大门。
    美国政府的这些“紧急措施”是在美国国际收支情况严重恶化，美元垂危的情况下被迫采取的，它充分反映了美帝国主义危机重重、焦头烂额的窘境。据约翰逊透露，由于侵越战争扩大引起的海外开支增加等原因，一九六七年美国的国际收支逆差额估计高达三十五亿至四十亿美元，这个数字几乎相当于前一年逆差额的三倍，是七年来的最高峰。这种状况对于在英镑贬值后遭到越来越沉重压力因而地位空前虚弱的美元来说，是致命的威胁。西方通讯社指出，约翰逊顾不得在今年的总统选举中可能丧失选票的后果，决定采取上述“饮鸩止渴”的措施，并且迫不及待地要在元旦日加以宣布，恰恰证明了美元处境的危急和窘迫。《纽约时报》在评论中承认，这些“紧急措施”看来是美国政府“在不愉快的和不曾预料到的被迫的情况下无可奈何地采取的”。
    消息表明，约翰逊被迫宣布采取上述措施也是帝国主义集团矛盾加深，特别是西欧国家对美国施加强大压力的结果。这些国家已经向美国明白表示，如果美国不认真采取行动来“改善”其国际收支情况，它们将拒绝支撑美元。在“紧急措施”中，美国决定把限制私人海外直接投资一项由过去几年内的“自愿”遵守改为“强制”实行，更是具体反映了美国在压力下被迫作出的让步。私人海外直接投资从来就是美国垄断集团占领国外市场、实行经济侵略的重要手段，它每年赚回的“利润”高达四十亿至五十亿美元，美帝国主义者自然是不肯轻易放弃的。因此几年来名义上实行“自愿性”限制，而实际上每年仍有大批美国资本输出海外，而西欧大陆各国更是美国资本输出的重要目标。这种情况引起了西欧国家日益强烈的不满。正是由于这些国家的反对，美国这次才被迫宣布，暂停对整个西欧大陆进行新的投资。
    在整个帝国主义集团加速衰落、分崩离析的情况下，美帝国主义企图通过上述几项所谓“紧急措施”来摆脱困境，这完全是痴心妄想。这些措施不仅挽救不了岌岌可危的美元，也缓和不了帝国主义之间日益加深的矛盾，而且必将使美国各方面的危机进一步加剧。
