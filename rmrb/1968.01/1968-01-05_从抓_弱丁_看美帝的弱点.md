Title: Seeing the Weaknesses of American Imperialism in the Drafting of "Weaklings"

The American aggressors in Vietnam are suffering increasingly heavy casualties. The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, has repeatedly sent requests from his headquarters in Saigon to Washington for more troops, causing the Johnson administration, which is facing a shortage of recruits, to be at a loss: where can they find more soldiers?

Recently, the U.S. ruling class has racked their brains and finally come up with an emergency solution: they have decided to lower their standards and squeeze out an additional 100,000 cannon fodder from those who do not meet the enlistment criteria each year. According to reports, these people are mostly low-ability individuals with insufficient intelligence or physical defects, some of whom cannot even lift 35 pounds. However, to the Johnson administration, which is facing a severe manpower shortage, these individuals have now become treasures.

The U.S. press has dubbed this "making do with the available" plan as a "large-scale operation to rescue manpower." To "rescue" manpower is indeed quite novel. This phrase vividly depicts the plight of American imperialism's manpower shortage.

Currently, the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam has reached nearly 500,000, surpassing the highest number of troops they deployed during the Korean War. In this war of aggression against Vietnam, American imperialism has already committed nearly half of its ground forces, one-fifth of its air force, and about one-fourth of its navy. Under the fierce attacks of the Vietnamese people, the number of casualties among the U.S. aggressor forces has been rising, reaching over 250,000 so far. To replenish troops, the Johnson administration has been drafting soldiers year after year. Now, with a shortage of able-bodied men, they have to resort to drafting "weaklings" to make up the numbers.

In fact, the U.S. soldiers in Vietnam are hardly "able-bodied." These pampered soldiers may have strong limbs, but their spirits are weak and listless, suffering from an incurable "shell shock." The U.S. military has been trying to boost morale by offering bonuses and rewards, but even with heavy rewards, there are no brave soldiers. Instead, desertion and refusal to fight have been increasing. Such a demoralized invading army, despite using all modern weapons except the atomic bomb, can only suffer defeats.

Chairman Mao said: "The decisive factor is man, not things. The balance of forces is not only a matter of military and economic strength, but also of manpower and morale. Military and economic strength must be commanded by man." The struggle between the Vietnamese people and American imperialism has vividly proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

Insufficient manpower and low morale are the fundamental weaknesses of American imperialism. This is determined by the nature of American imperialism's aggression. American imperialism wants to dominate the world, but its manpower, military strength, material resources, and financial resources are far from sufficient compared to its ambitions. Sending a few million troops to carry out aggression in various parts of the world, how can they not be stretched thin? American imperialism sends its troops to distant foreign countries to wage unjust wars of aggression, and it is no wonder that the soldiers do not want to die for the interests of the monopolies, and their morale is low. As American imperialism suffers defeats in the Vietnam War, not only do the invading soldiers on the battlefield become increasingly war-weary, but the anti-war movement within the country is also growing. More and more young people are strongly opposing conscription. The difficulties faced by the U.S. ruling class are insurmountable.

Now, the Johnson administration, in order to replenish troops, is resorting to drafting "weaklings" to be cannon fodder in Vietnam. This will not only fail to enhance American imperialism's combat effectiveness in Vietnam but will also further provoke the discontent of the domestic masses, thereby further developing the movement of the American people against the Vietnam War. This so-called "rescue operation" is absolutely incapable of "rescuing" American imperialism from the quagmire of defeat in Vietnam. On the contrary, it will only hasten its doom.

    从抓“弱丁”看美帝的弱点
    郭辛兵
    美国侵略强盗在越南战场伤亡越来越惨重，侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰不断从西贡总部向华盛顿发出要求增兵呼号，使兵源枯竭的约翰逊政府伤透脑筋：从哪儿去找兵呢？
    最近，美国统治集团挖空心思，终于想出了一个救急的办法：决定降格以求，每年从不合入伍标准的人当中再挤出十万名炮灰。据报道，这些人大都是一些智力不足的低能儿，或者体格有缺陷甚至连三十五磅重都举不起的病弱者。而他们对于大闹兵荒的约翰逊政府来说，现在却成了宝贝。
    美国报刊把这项“滥竽充数”的计划称之为“抢救人力的大规模行动”。人力还用“抢救”，倒也颇为新鲜。这句话活画出美帝国主义兵力不足的困境。
    在越南战场上，美国侵略军的人数现在已经近五十万，超过了它在侵朝战争所用兵力的最高纪录。在这场侵越战争中，美帝国主义已投入了它全部地面部队近二分之一，空军的五分之一和海军的四分之一左右。而在越南人民的猛烈打击之下，美国侵略军的伤亡人数逐级上升，到目前为止达到二十五万以上。为了补充兵员，约翰逊政府年年征兵，大抓壮丁。现在，壮丁不够，只好抓“弱丁”来凑数。
    其实，在越南战场的美国兵又何尝是“壮丁”呢。这些少爷兵虽然可能是四肢发达，但精神却萎糜不振，患上了不治之症“吃惊病”。美国军方不断用加饷发奖来刺激士气，可是，重赏之下，也并无勇夫。开小差、拒绝作战的事反而日益增多。这样士无斗志的侵略军队，尽管使用了原子弹以外的一切现代化武器，也只能连吃败仗。
    毛主席说：“决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”越南人民同美帝国主义之间进行的较量，雄辩地证明了毛主席的英明论断。
    兵力不足，士气低落，是美帝国主义的根本弱点。这是美帝国主义的侵略本质所决定的。美帝国主义要独霸全球，而它的人力、军力、物力和财力，同它的野心比较起来，都远远不足。二、三百万军队要在世界各地进行侵略活动，怎能不捉襟见肘呢？美帝国主义把它的军队派到远离本土的外国去进行非正义的侵略战争，士兵不愿意为垄断集团的侵略利益送命，士气不低落才是怪事。随着美帝国主义在侵越战争中节节失败，不但战场上的侵略军士兵日益厌战，国内人民反对侵越战争的运动也不断高涨，广大青年越来越强烈地反对征兵。美国统治集团所面对的这些困难，是无法克服的。
    现在，约翰逊政府为了补充兵员，不惜搜罗“弱丁”去当侵越炮灰。这不仅不能增强美帝国主义在越南战场上的作战力量，反而只会更加激起国内人民群众的不满，从而使美国人民反对侵越战争的运动进一步发展。这种所谓“抢救人力”的行动，是绝对不可能把美帝国主义从侵越失败的泥潭中“抢救”出来的，相反，只能使它更快地遭到灭顶之灾。
