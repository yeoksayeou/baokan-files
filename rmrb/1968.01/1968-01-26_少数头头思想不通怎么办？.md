In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, due to the "private" interests and factionalism in the minds of a few leaders, the unity of the two factions is hindered. Should we kick out the leaders and achieve unity, or should we enthusiastically help the leaders improve their understanding and achieve unity together? The two revolutionary mass organizations in the Tongzhen Section of Qinghemen Coal Mine, Fuxin Mining Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly helped the leaders overcome selfishness, smash factionalism, and become pioneers in revolutionary unity. The entire section's masses urged the leaders, and the leaders led the masses, quickly achieving revolutionary unity.

The revolutionary masses of the two factions in Tongzhen Section, after seriously studying the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, recognized the great significance of revolutionary unity, gradually eliminated their hostile feelings, and became even more eager to unite. However, a few leaders could not keep up with the situation, hindering the unity.

At this time, some workers suggested kicking out anyone who did not want to unite. Is this the right approach? With the help of the propaganda team comrades, the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." They also discussed how to correctly handle the issue of leaders whose understanding lags behind the situation. Everyone agreed that leaders are the key to achieving revolutionary unity. The leaders of the two factions are those who have emerged from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, selected by the masses of the two factions in the struggle. They led everyone to fiercely attack the bourgeois reactionary line, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and contributing to the Cultural Revolution. Now, a few of them cannot keep up with the situation, but we should not kick them out. Instead, we should enthusiastically help them to quickly catch up with the situation, just as they did in the past, leading everyone to charge forward and make new contributions in achieving revolutionary unity and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Thus, the workers, together with the propaganda team comrades, formed visiting groups to conduct detailed political work in the leaders' homes. Some leaders believed that the contradictions between the two factions were a matter of line struggle and could only be "fought" and not "merged." The propaganda team comrades and revolutionary workers studied Mao Zedong's works with them, recalled the path taken during the Cultural Revolution, analyzed the causes of the opposition between the two factions, and together exposed and criticized the reactionary line and the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders who incited the masses to fight each other.

Through this series of work, these leaders realized that the opposition between the two factions was entirely the result of the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by China's Khrushchev, and that the contradictions among the masses were internal contradictions among the people. "If we treat comrades as enemies, we are standing on the enemy's side." The help from the masses made these leaders awaken, and their hostile feelings gradually disappeared. One leader said: Only by distinguishing friends from enemies can there be a reliable basis for unity. In the past, the thousands of accounts of mutual attacks between the two factions should all be charged to China's Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in this unit. However, another leader said: "Unity is possible, but who will protect who, and who is good or bad must be clarified first." The workers said: Problems must be viewed comprehensively and developmentally, not just in terms of a single moment or event. Although the two organizations had different levels of revolution and different times of rebellion, all revolutionary masses are infinitely devoted to Chairman Mao and deeply hate China's Khrushchev. If we do not see that the broad revolutionary masses are revolutionary, we are actually denying our own revolution. One leader previously always thought that the other side was "old conservative" and was unwilling to unite. Later, with the help of the masses, he analyzed and ranked all the cadres and workers in the section, feeling that except for a few with serious political problems who could not be united with, the rest were his class brothers and revolutionary comrades, and there was no reason not to unite with them. He realized that the reason he previously thought the other side was "conservative" was due to his own "unique revolutionary" mentality, selfishness, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, which blinded his eyes and prevented him from seeing that the broad masses on the other side were revolutionary.

Through the help and promotion of the masses, the leaders of the two factions deeply realized that the fundamental reason why the two factions fought "internal wars" and could not achieve revolutionary unity was that there was still bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in their minds. Factionalism is the great enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the obstacle to the revolutionary unity of the two factions. With the great enemy in front, we must rise up with the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely smash the factionalism in our minds. The leaders of the two factions, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "the two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak for themselves, and each do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences," with the help of the masses, seriously conducted self-criticism, overcame selfishness, and annihilated factionalism, reaching a unity agreement. From then on, the two major factions that had fought "internal wars" for more than a year finally united under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, this section has established a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team based on revolutionary unity. All revolutionary workers in the section are determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practical actions and strive forward to achieve comprehensive victory in the revolution and production.

    少数头头思想不通怎么办？
    在实现革命大联合的过程中，由于少数头头脑子里的“私”字和派性作怪，使两派联合受到阻碍怎么办？是踢开头头搞联合，还是热情帮助头头提高认识一起搞联合？阜新矿务局清河门煤矿通整段的两大革命群众组织，在驻矿人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，按毛主席的指示办事，满腔热情地帮助头头克服私心，打倒派性，作革命大联合的带头人，全段群众促头头，头头带群众，迅速实现了革命大联合。
    通整段两派组织的革命群众，在认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示以后，认清了革命大联合的重大意义，对立情绪逐渐消除了，联合的愿望更加迫切了。可是，有少数头头跟不上形势，使联合受到了阻碍。
    这时，有的职工提出，谁不愿联合就踢开谁。这样做对不对？职工们在宣传队同志的帮助下，反复学习毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”并且就如何正确对待一时认识跟不上形势的头头这个问题，进行了讨论。大家认为，头头是实现革命大联合的关键，两派头头都是从资产阶级反动路线的迫害下“杀”出来的，都是两派群众在斗争中挑选出来的。他们领着大家大造资产阶级反动路线的反，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对文化大革命作出了贡献。现在他们当中少数人一时跟不上形势，不能因此就一脚踢开他们，而要满腔热情地帮助他们，使他们迅速跟上形势，和过去一样带领大家冲锋陷阵，在革命大联合和落实毛主席最新指示中作出新的贡献。于是，工人们就和宣传队同志一起，组成走访小组，深入到头头家里去作细致的思想政治工作。有的头头认为两派矛盾是路线斗争，只能“斗合”，不能“捏合”。宣传队同志和革命职工就同他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起回忆文化大革命以来所走过的路程，分析两派对立的原因，一起揭露、批判反动路线及一小撮走资派挑动群众斗群众的罪恶。
    通过这一系列的工作，使这些头头认识到，两派组织对立，完全是中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线造成的恶果，群众之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，“如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”群众的帮助，使这些头头觉悟过来了，对立情绪逐步消除了。有一个头头说：只有分清了敌友，才有联合的可靠基础。过去我们两派互相攻击的千笔账万笔账，都要记在中国赫鲁晓夫和本单位走资派身上。但是，还有的头头说：“联合可以，谁保谁革，谁好谁赖得先弄明白才行。”职工们就说：看问题必须全面地发展地看，不能只看一时一事。尽管两个组织革命有先后，造反有早晚，但是广大革命群众都是无限热爱毛主席，无比仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫的。如果看不到广大革命群众是革命的，实际上也就否认了自己是革命的。有个头头以前总认为对方是“老保”，始终不愿联合。后来，在群众的帮助下，他把全段干部、职工挨个分析排队，感到除了极个别有严重政治问题的人不能联合外，其余都是自己的阶级兄弟和革命战友，没有理由不跟他们联合。他认识到过去所以认为对方“保”，是由于自己有“唯我独革”的思想，有私心，有资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，私心和派性蒙住了眼睛，看不到对方广大群众是要革命的。
    经过群众的帮助和促进，两派头头深刻地认识到，过去两派打“内战”，不能实现革命大联合，根本原因还在于自己头脑中有资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，派性是落实毛主席最新指示的大敌，是两派实现革命大联合的障碍。大敌当前，必须奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，坚决把头脑中的派性打倒。两派头头遵照毛主席关于“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，在群众的帮助下，认真做了自我批评，斗倒了私心，围歼了派性，达成了联合协议。从此，打了一年多“内战”的两大派组织，终于在毛泽东思想的旗帜下联合起来了。
    现在，这个段已经在革命大联合的基础上，建立了革命“三结合”的领导班子，全段革命职工决心用实际行动全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取革命和生产的全面胜利而奋勇前进。　（据新华社沈阳电）
