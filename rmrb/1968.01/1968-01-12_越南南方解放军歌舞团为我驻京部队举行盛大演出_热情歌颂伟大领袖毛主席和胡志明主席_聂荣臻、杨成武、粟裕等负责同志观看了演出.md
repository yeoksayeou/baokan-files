The Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe held a grand performance for the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing this evening at the Great Hall of the People.

Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu, Deputy Minister of National Defense Su Yu, and other leaders from the various departments of the People's Liberation Army, various military branches, Beijing troops, and relevant departments attended the performance.

The magnificent Great Hall of the People was brightly lit tonight, filled with the brotherly combat unity and great friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam. The performance began with the songs "Liberate the South" and "The East is Red," beloved by the peoples of both countries. The cultural warriors from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam sang and danced enthusiastically in praise of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Many of the songs and dances performed by the cultural warriors of South Vietnam reflected the heroic deeds of the people of South Vietnam, who, relying on the power of people's war, have defeated the American imperialists, leaving them in a desperate situation. When they sang the song "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China" based on Chairman Mao's quotations, and revolutionary songs like "Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light" and "The Three-Eight Style Song," the audience erupted in wave after wave of enthusiastic applause.

During the intermission, Nie Rongzhen, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, and other leaders met with the leaders and some members of the song and dance troupe, and after the performance ended, they went on stage to congratulate them on their successful performance. Comrade Su Yu, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, presented a banner embroidered with "Victory will surely belong to the heroic people of Vietnam" to the Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe.

The head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's permanent representative office in China, Nguyen Van Quang, the acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, Le Chung Chi, and the military attache, Colonel Chen Wenpeng, also attended the performance.

On January 11, the Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe held a grand performance at the Great Hall of the People to entertain the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen and others attended the performance.
