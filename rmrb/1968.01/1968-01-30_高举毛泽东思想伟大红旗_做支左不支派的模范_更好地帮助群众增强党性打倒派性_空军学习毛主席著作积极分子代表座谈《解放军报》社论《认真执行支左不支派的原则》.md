In commemoration of the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the "People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses," representatives from the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, who attended the second conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Air Force, seriously studied the important editorial "Seriously Implement the Principle of Supporting the Left Without Supporting Factions" from the *People's Liberation Army Daily*. They reviewed their practical experiences from the past year and shared their insights.

The representatives enthusiastically praised, "The great helmsman Chairman Mao's call for the 'People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses' is the latest development of Mao Zedong's great theory on building a revolutionary army of the proletariat. It is a major strategic measure of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and an important component of Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Currently, to further implement Chairman Mao's great call, we must seriously implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. This is the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and doing the 'Three Supports, Two Military' work better."

The representatives emphasized, "Currently, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is playing the role of a guerrilla force for the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, posing a major threat to the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and is extremely reactionary. It must be resolutely overthrown. In our support-the-left work, we must resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, help revolutionary masses strengthen proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and unite all revolutionary mass organizations on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. We must pool our strengths and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The representatives said, "To achieve supporting the left without supporting factions, we must arm the broad masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and help the revolutionary masses turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their soul. This is the fundamental task of the 'Three Supports, Two Military' work. In the process of supporting the left, they received each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, deeply entering factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and neighborhoods to convey Chairman Mao's voice to the hearts of the revolutionary masses. They ensured that all efforts were focused on studying and propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and all hearts were dedicated to implementing and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The representatives pointed out: The process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a continuous struggle against interference from the right and the ultra-left, and a process of using proletarian party spirit to continuously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism."

The representatives said, "To achieve supporting the left without supporting factions, we must do a good job of in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. Repeatedly, they propagated to the revolutionary masses that factionalism is a big poisonous snake. If it wraps around you, you will be led by the nose by the class enemy, and you will be in danger of being bitten to death. Whether one can consciously strengthen proletarian party spirit and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation of the Cultural Revolution, and it is also an important standard to test loyalty to Chairman Mao."

The representatives' another common experience is that to achieve supporting the left without supporting factions, one must correctly treat the masses. The revolutionary principle of supporting the left without supporting factions correctly reflects the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "We should believe in the masses" and to unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres. Many representatives said, "We must correctly treat the masses who were once deceived. We must see that the majority of them have awakened and stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The attitude of a Communist towards backward people is not one of contempt, of looking down upon them, but of loving them, of uniting with them, of persuading them, of encouraging them to advance.' We must enthusiastically help them and never exclude them from the revolutionary ranks."

The representatives expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, further do a good job of the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and create new achievements for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　做支左不支派的模范
    更好地帮助群众增强党性打倒派性
    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表座谈《解放军报》社论《认真执行支左不支派的原则》
    据新华社二十九日讯　在纪念伟大领袖毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召一周年的时候，出席空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的、来自“三支”“两军”前线的部分代表，认真学习了《解放军报》《认真执行支左不支派的原则》的重要社论，回顾一年来参加“三支”“两军”工作的实践，畅谈了心得体会。
    代表们热烈歌颂说，伟大统帅毛主席号召“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，是毛主席建设无产阶级革命军队的伟大理论的最新发展，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大战略措施，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论的重要组成部分。当前进一步贯彻毛主席的这一伟大号召，就要认真执行支左不支派的原则。这是我军条条落实、全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好的关键。
    代表们特别强调说，在当前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性正在起着党内一小撮走资派的别动队的作用，是破坏毛主席最新指示全面落实的大敌，具有极大的反动性，必须坚决打倒。我们在支左工作中必须坚决执行支左不支派的原则，帮助革命群众加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，使一切革命的群众组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上联合起来，群策群力，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    代表们说，要做到支左不支派，就要用毛主席的最新指示武装广大群众的头脑，帮助广大革命群众把毛主席最新指示化为灵魂。这是“三支”“两军”工作的根本任务。在支左过程中，他们接到毛主席的每一条最新指示，总是以最大的热情，最快的速度，深入厂矿、农村、机关、学校、街道，把毛主席的声音传到广大革命群众的心坎上。让千股劲，万股劲，股股劲都使在学习和宣传毛主席最新指示上；让千颗心，万颗心，颗颗红心都落实到执行和捍卫毛主席最新指示上。代表们指出：落实毛主席最新指示的过程，是不断地同来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰作斗争的过程，也是用无产阶级党性不断战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的过程。
    代表们说，要做到支左不支派，就要做好深入细致的思想政治工作。反复地向革命群众宣传派性是一条大毒蛇，被它缠住了身，就会被阶级敌人牵着鼻子走，就有被它咬死的危险。能不能自觉地加强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是在文化大革命的新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志，也是检验忠不忠于毛主席的重要标准。
    代表们的另一个共同体会是，要做到支左不支派，必须正确对待群众。支左不支派这个革命原则，正确地体现了伟大领袖毛主席关于
  “我们应当相信群众”，要团结百分之九十五以上的群众和百分之九十五以上的干部的光辉思想。许多代表说，要正确对待过去曾经受蒙蔽的群众，要看到他们的绝大多数已经觉醒，站到毛主席的革命路线上来，要遵照毛主席“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进”的教导，热情地帮助他们，绝不能把他们排斥在革命队伍之外。
    代表们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真执行支左不支派的原则，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
