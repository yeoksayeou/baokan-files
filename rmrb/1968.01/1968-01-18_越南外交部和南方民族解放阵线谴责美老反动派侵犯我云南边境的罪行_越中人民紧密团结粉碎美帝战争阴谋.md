Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and the National Liberation Front Condemn the Crimes of American and Laotian Reactionaries Invading China’s Yunnan Border
Vietnamese and Chinese People Unite to Smash the U.S. Imperialist War Plot

	Newspaper: New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 15th

	The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 14th, strongly condemning the bandit planes of U.S. imperialism and the Laotian rightists for brazenly bombing the Miao village region of Yunnan Province, China, a heinous crime.

	The statement pointed out that this is a very serious new act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism and the Laotian reactionary clique against the People's Republic of China.

	The statement emphasized that this action was taken at a time when the U.S. was intensifying its "special war" in Laos and blatantly slandering and threatening the Kingdom of Cambodia. It is clear that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are hastening to strengthen the Vietnam War and plot to expand the war beyond Vietnam, opposing the peoples of the Indochina countries and the Chinese people.

	The statement said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely support the correct stance expounded by the Government of the People's Republic of China in its statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 12th. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the above-mentioned crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its Laotian lackeys against the Chinese people. They must stop all acts of war provocation against the People's Republic of China. The statement concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people, together with the fraternal Chinese people, will resolutely oppose all hostile actions by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China and thoroughly support the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Laotian people.

	The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's External Liaison Committee issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning the bandit planes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos for brazenly bombing the Miao village region of Yunnan Province, China.

	The statement said: This is a deliberate act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Vientiane. This once again proves that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are stubbornly pursuing a policy of hostility towards China, taking new and extremely serious military adventurous actions, attempting to use this to reverse their defeat in Vietnam.

	The statement said that the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully support the correct stance expounded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in its statement of January 12, 1968.

	The statement concluded by saying that the people of South Vietnam and the People's Liberation Armed Forces, together with the great 700 million Chinese people and the patriotic people of Laos and Cambodia, will closely unite to thwart all plots by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to intensify and expand the war of aggression.

    声明说：这是美帝国主义及其在万象的仆从蓄意进行的战争挑衅。这再一次证明，美帝国主义及其仆从顽固地推行敌视中国的政策，采取新的极其严重的军事冒险行动，企图以此来挽回它们在越南的败局。
    声明说，越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线完全支持中华人民共和国外交部在一九六八年一月十二日声明中所阐明的正确立场。
    声明最后说，越南南方人民和人民解放武装力量同伟大的七亿中国人民以及老挝、柬埔寨的爱国人民紧密团结，决心挫败美帝国主义及其仆从加紧扩大侵略战争的一切阴谋活动。
