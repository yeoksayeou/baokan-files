The revolutionary forces at the Ganglongling Iron Mine of Anshan Steel Works, with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, have set up extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unified the thoughts and actions of the revolutionary forces, and thus the revolutionary great alliance has become increasingly consolidated and developed. The entire mine is now filled with a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere.

Currently, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held nine to ten times at this mine, with over 13,000 participants. They study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and immediately put them into practice. Over 90% of the workers have participated in the revolutionary great alliance organized by departments, workshops, and teams. The revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units are deepening, and production is improving month by month. Under these favorable conditions, the mine established a revolutionary committee on December 9 last year.

How did the proletarian revolutionary forces at Ganglongling Iron Mine consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance while thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions? They mainly focused on the following three aspects:

1. Only by turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the masses, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit, can the revolutionary great alliance be consolidated and developed.

After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the entire Ganglongling Iron Mine thoroughly implemented it and resolutely followed it. The revolutionary great alliance was at the forefront of all the factories and mines in Anshan Steel Works. However, soon after the alliance was formed, due to the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, some people still had the phenomenon of each playing their own drum and beating their own gong. This not only affected the consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance but also hindered the development of production.

The revolutionary forces at this mine, in response to this situation, conducted extensive and meticulous ideological and political work:

They addressed disputes caused by factionalism through active ideological education. In November last year, a dispute arose over whether two members of a revolutionary faction could participate in the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Some said, "If they are included, it will disrupt the ranks and go out to parade." With the help of the PLA comrades, they insisted on letting the masses educate themselves and firmly believed in the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. They held four consecutive days of meetings, studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions with the problems in mind. As a result, Chairman Mao's instructions were implemented, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was resisted, and proletarian party spirit was further strengthened.

They constantly guarded against the emergence of factionalism. Factionalism often lurks deep in the mind and emerges at the slightest opportunity, splitting the revolutionary great alliance. In response to this situation, the revolutionary forces paid great attention to investigation and research, observing moods during meetings, attitudes during speeches, fighting spirit during battles, and daily performance. Because the ideological and political work was solid and timely, the masses realized the value of consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the harm of factionalism. Factionalism only benefits the enemy and must be resolutely overthrown. After achieving the revolutionary great alliance, the unified revolutionary mass organization of the entire mine—Ganglongling Iron Mine Defense of Mao Zedong Thought Battle Headquarters—has remained very stable and has not experienced any splits.

Through the extensive study classes of Mao Zedong Thought, they constantly and unceasingly fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, eliminated factionalism, strengthened party spirit, and in the principle of revolution, created an atmosphere of unity and joint struggle against the enemy.

2. Arm the leadership with Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of the leadership, which is an important link in consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance.

After the proletarian revolutionary forces at this mine took power, due to changes in status, some leading members had selfish tendencies rising, and there were tendencies of special privileges in their style of work. With the help of the PLA, the leaders of the "Headquarters" sat down for a rectification campaign, taking "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, seriously studying the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's relevant works, checking and comparing, and carrying out self-criticism. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the leaders of the "Headquarters" actively went to the masses for self-examination and accepted the masses' criticism. Later, the "Headquarters" also proposed five regulations for changing their style of work and established a system for studying Chairman Mao's works. They also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "persisting in what is good for the people and correcting what is wrong for the people" and regularly participated in manual labor, accepting the supervision of the masses.

Within the leadership core of the "Headquarters," attitudes and analyses of various issues often differ, which is a normal phenomenon. However, if Mao Zedong Thought is not used to unify them in a timely manner, it will create sparks that split the revolutionary great alliance. A leader of the "Headquarters" was unhappy because his opinion was not adopted by the majority. Everyone sat down to seriously listen to his opinion, then used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and compare, and unified their views. This not only eliminated the estrangement but also educated this member. From this incident, they deeply felt that only by using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything can the leadership core have unified thoughts and actions.

3. Boldly liberate and use cadres, and give full play to the role of revolutionary cadres as backbones and cores, which is the key to consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance.

Chairman Mao said: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of one's own unit. This issue must be resolved." The revolutionary forces at Ganglongling Iron Mine, following Chairman Mao's teachings, through a series of painstaking ideological and political work, have liberated over 90% of the deputy section-level and above cadres in the mine. Most of them have been absorbed into the revolutionary mass organizations, and some have even taken on the roles of "Headquarters" standing committee members and core group members. Many revolutionary cadres dare to take responsibility, fighting, studying, laboring, and living together with the revolutionary forces, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and helping new cadres grow. This has greatly promoted the consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance.

    用毛主席最新指示统一革命队伍的思想行动
    鞍钢弓长岭铁矿大办毛泽东思想学习班，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，革命大联合越来越巩固和发展，全矿出现热气腾腾的革命景象
    据新华社鞍山十一日电　鞍钢弓长岭铁矿无产阶级革命派，在解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，统一革命队伍思想，统一行动，因而革命大联合越来越巩固和发展，全矿出现了热气腾腾的革命景象。
    现在，这个矿各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，已经办了九到十期，参加学习的有一万三千多人次。他们学习了毛主席最新指示就用，说了就做。全矿百分之九十多的职工参加了按部门、按车间、按班组的革命大联合，革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改正在深入发展，生产一月比一月搞得好。在大好形势下，这个矿在去年十二月九日建立了革命委员会。
    弓长岭铁矿的无产阶级革命派，是怎样在全面落实毛主席最新指示中巩固和发展革命大联合的？他们主要抓住了下面三个环节：
      （一）只有让毛主席的最新指示变为群众的自觉行动，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，才能巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示后，弓长岭铁矿全矿上下认真落实，坚决照办，革命大联合走在鞍钢各厂、矿的最前头。但是，联合不久，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，有些人仍然存在各打各的鼓，各敲各的锣的现象。这不但影响革命大联合的巩固，还影响生产的发展。
    这个矿的革命派，针对这种情况，做了大量耐心细致的思想政治工作：
    抓住因为派性引起的纠纷，进行活的思想教育。去年十一月，因为两名革命派组织成员能不能参加革命三结合的问题，引起了一场风波。有的说：“如果把他俩结合上，就拉出队伍上街游行。”在解放军同志的帮助下，他们坚持让群众自己教育自己，坚决相信毛泽东思想的无比威力。他们连续召开四天的会议，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示。结果，毛主席的指示落实了，资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性受到了抵制，无产阶级的党性进一步增强。
    平时狠抓派性的一露头。派性，往往潜伏在思想深处，一遇机会，就冒出来，分裂革命大联合。针对这一情况，革命派很重视调查研究，开会看情绪，发言看态度，战斗看劲头，平时看表现，把思想政治工作做在前头。由于思想政治工作做得扎实而及时，群众认识到巩固革命大联合的可贵，闹派性的危害。派性只利于敌人，要坚决打倒。实现革命大联合以后，全矿统一的革命群众组织——弓长岭铁矿捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部所属的组织一直很巩固，没有发生分裂现象。
    通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，经常不断地斗私批修，扫除派性，增强党性，在革命的原则下，出现了团结一致、共同对敌的气氛。
    （二）用毛泽东思想武装领导班子，促进领导班子的革命化，这是巩固和发展革命大联合的重要环节。
    这个矿的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，由于地位的变化，有的领导成员私字有些抬头，作风上出现了特殊化的倾向。在解放军帮助下，“总部”领导成员及时坐下来整风，以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真学习“老三篇”和毛主席有关著作，检查对照，开展自我批评。在提高思想认识的基础上，“总部”领导成员主动地到群众中做检查，接受群众的批评，以后“总部”还提出了转变作风的五条规定，并建立了毛主席著作学习制度。他们还遵照毛主席“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的教导，定期参加体力劳动，接受群众的监督。
    在“总部”领导核心内部，对各种问题的态度和分析往往会有所不同，这是正常的现象。但是如果不用毛泽东思想及时统一起来，就会造成分裂革命大联合的“火种”。有一位“总部”领导成员，因为自己意见没被多数成员采纳，很不满意。大家就坐下来认真听取他的意见，然后用毛泽东思想分析对照，统一看法。这样做的结果，不但消除了隔阂，而且使这位成员受到了教育。从这件事情中，他们深刻地体会到：只有用毛泽东思想统帅一切，领导核心才能思想一致，行动统一。
      （三）大胆地解放和使用干部，发挥革命干部的骨干、核心作用，这是巩固和发展革命大联合的关键。
    毛主席说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”弓长岭铁矿革命派遵照毛主席的教导，经过一系列艰苦细致的思想政治工作，已经把全矿百分之九十多的副科级以上干部解放出来，其中大部分被吸收到革命群众组织中来，有的还担任了“总部”常委和核心小组成员。许多革命干部勇于负责，同革命派同战斗、同学习、同劳动、同生活，按毛主席指示办事，帮助新干部成长。这样，有力地促进了革命大联合的巩固。
