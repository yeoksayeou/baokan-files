The broad masses of workers in Albania's construction sector have carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, successfully completing the 1967 production tasks.

Albania's total construction volume in 1967 increased by 8% compared to 1966. The broad masses of workers, displaying great enthusiasm, successfully completed the construction of important projects for the development of Albania's economy, such as the Fertilizer Plant in Fieri, the Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant in Lushnje, and the Cement Plant in Fushë-Krujë.

The water conservancy construction tasks for last year have also been overfulfilled. The construction plan for the Vau i Dejës hydroelectric power station, a major project of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, was also overfulfilled in 1967.

The construction of the Logara-Fieri railway is progressing smoothly. In the construction of highways, the laying of high-voltage power lines, and the expansion of social and cultural facilities, the plans have also been well completed.

Workers have also achieved great successes in reducing construction costs, simplifying design and construction, improving productivity, and saving raw materials.

The workers in the construction sector recently responded enthusiastically to the call of the Labor Party. After the earthquakes in the districts of Dibër and Librazhd, they immediately packed their bags and rushed to the disaster-stricken areas, working day and night to help the local people overcome the natural disaster.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana, the broad masses of commercial workers in Albania have implemented the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party, following the instructions of Albania's great leader Enver Hoxha to be "servants of the people," successfully completing the 1967 tasks.

In 1967, the national commodity turnover volume in Albania will reach 102% of the planned target, an increase of more than 5% compared to the previous year.

The national commercial network has significantly increased the supply of sugar, dairy products, meat, woolen fabrics, cotton cloth, knitted goods, cement, and timber to the people.

The revolutionary movement in Albania has strongly promoted the ideological transformation of people. Engineers and technicians have gone deep into the construction sites, working with the workers to conduct surveys and designs, greatly accelerating the progress of the projects. This is a scene of engineering and technical personnel on the construction site of the Logara-Fieri railway conducting measurements.
