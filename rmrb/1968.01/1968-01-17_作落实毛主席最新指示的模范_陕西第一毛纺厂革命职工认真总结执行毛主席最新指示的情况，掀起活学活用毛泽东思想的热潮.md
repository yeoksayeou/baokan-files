The revolutionary workers of Shaanxi First Woolen Mill have carefully summarized and reviewed their implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, sparking a wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xian, January 16th: The revolutionary cadres and workers of Shaanxi First Woolen Mill, while arranging and planning this year's revolutionary and production work, have carefully summarized and reviewed the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions last year. They deeply feel that regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must study, study, and study again, follow, follow, and follow again. To follow is to win.

Shaanxi First Woolen Mill was the first factory in the Xianyang region of Shaanxi to achieve revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and to establish a revolutionary committee. Last year's production tasks were completed very well. Through summarizing and reviewing the work of 1967, based on the requirements of the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, they proposed and implemented this year's battle tasks. Since the New Year, the entire factory has launched an unprecedented large-scale movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been set up in workshops and teams. The revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit are being carried out more deeply. In the more than ten days since the New Year, the revolution is booming, and the production level has greatly surpassed the same period last year.

The main experience of the revolutionary workers of Shaanxi First Woolen Mill in following Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be summarized as: having a loyal heart, establishing a public spirit, and firmly grasping the application.

The revolutionary workers of this factory deeply feel that to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must first be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Only by emphasizing this loyalty can one act in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow closely and quickly, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions decisively and effectively.

Recently, they have further improved the system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, insisting on studying and applying them every day. Now, all machines and workbenches have Chairman Mao's latest instructions hung on them. Many teams and workers on the same shift have implemented the system of passing on Chairman Mao's quotations.

The revolutionary workers of this factory deeply feel that to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and loyal to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must take "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie's selfishness, and establish the public spirit of the proletariat.

After the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this factory took power, some comrades, due to changes in their positions, had selfish thoughts. These comrades, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have criticized and repudiated their selfishness, determined to be the vanguard in criticizing and repudiating selfishness, and to be a model in following Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The fundamental experience of Shaanxi First Woolen Mill in achieving remarkable results in revolution and production last year is to firmly grasp the application of Chairman Mao's works and instructions.

This factory originally had two factions that could not unite for a long time. After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions," the stationed army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team helped both sides to seriously study and focus on the application, quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions, achieving revolutionary unity, and being the first in the Xianyang region to establish a revolutionary committee. Now, the entire factory presents a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness, which is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in actions.

The revolutionary workers of this factory deeply feel that to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must also grasp the speed. Speed means being swift and decisive, acting as soon as the wind blows, and doing what is said. The revolutionary workers of this factory have achieved three speeds in following Chairman Mao's latest instructions: quick study, quick propaganda, and quick implementation.

    作落实毛主席最新指示的模范
    陕西第一毛纺厂革命职工认真总结执行毛主席最新指示的情况，掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮
    据新华社西安十六日电　陕西第一毛纺厂无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在安排和规划今年的革命和生产等项工作时，认真总结和检查了去年执行毛主席最新指示的情况。他们深深地体会到：对于毛主席的最新指示，必须学习、学习、再学习，紧跟、紧跟、再紧跟。紧跟就是胜利。
    陕西第一毛纺厂是陕西咸阳地区工矿企业中实现革命大联合和革命三结合、建立革命委员会最早的一个工厂，去年的生产任务完成得很好。全厂革命职工通过总结、检查一九六七年的工作，根据《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论的要求，提出和落实了今年的战斗任务。从元旦以来，全厂更加广泛地掀起了规模空前的活学活用毛主席最新指示的热潮，在车间、班组普遍开办了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班。革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，正进一步深入地开展起来。元旦过后的十多天里，革命搞得热气腾腾，生产水平大大超过去年同期。
    陕西第一毛纺厂广大革命职工紧跟毛主席最新指示的主要体会，概括起来就是：心怀一个忠字，大立一个公字，狠抓一个用字。
    这个厂的革命职工深深体会到，要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，首先就要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的最新指示。只有突出这个忠字，行动上对毛主席的最新指示才能跟得紧，跟得快，才能做到对毛主席的最新指示坚决照办，立竿见影。
    最近，他们进一步健全了活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示的制度，坚持天天读，天天用，学一点，用一点。现在，所有的机器和工作台，都挂着毛主席最新指示的语录。许多班组之间，同岗位的工人之间，实行了毛主席语录交班制度。
    这个厂的革命职工深深体会到，要忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛主席的最新指示，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破资产阶级的私字，大立无产阶级的公字。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌权后，有的同志由于地位发生了变化，头脑里的私字就冒出来了，这些同志学习了毛主席的最新指示，就狠狠地斗私破私，决心当破私立公的尖兵，作紧跟毛主席最新指示的模范。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”陕西第一毛纺厂去年在革命和生产上获得显著成就的一条根本经验就是对毛主席的著作和指示，大抓了一个“用”字。
    这个厂原来有两派，在相当长的时间里联合不起来。毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示后，驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助双方认真学习，在用字上狠下功夫，把毛主席的最新指示迅速落实在自己的行动上，实现了革命大联合，在咸阳地区工矿企业中第一个建立了革命委员会。现在，全厂呈现出一派团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的新气象，这是把毛主席的最新指示落实在行动上的结果。
    这个厂的革命职工深深体会到，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，还必须紧抓一个快字。快就是雷厉风行，闻风而动，说干就干。这个厂的革命职工对毛主席的最新指示，做到了三快：学习快，宣传快，执行快。
