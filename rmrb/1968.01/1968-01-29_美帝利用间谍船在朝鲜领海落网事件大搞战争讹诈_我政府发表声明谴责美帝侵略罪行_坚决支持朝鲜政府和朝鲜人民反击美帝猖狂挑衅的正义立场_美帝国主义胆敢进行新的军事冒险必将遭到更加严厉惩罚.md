The Chinese government issued a statement on January 28, the full text of which is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China
January 28, 1968

On January 23, the naval forces of the Korean People's Army captured a U.S. armed spy ship, the "Pueblo," which had intruded into Korean territorial waters to conduct espionage activities. On January 27, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement pointing out: "The provocative actions of U.S. imperialism are another blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and a direct act of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"; "The Korean people have taken resolute self-defense measures, which are completely correct"; "No matter what the U.S. imperialists do, they cannot cover up their ugly aggressive nature, nor can they intimidate the Korean people." The Chinese government and people firmly support the just stance of the Korean government and people in countering the U.S. imperialists' outrageous provocations.

The intrusion of U.S. warships into Korean territorial waters to conduct espionage activities is not accidental. Currently, the U.S. aggressors, in an attempt to salvage their failing situation in the Vietnam War, are plotting to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam and are intensifying their aggressive and war activities throughout Asia. The U.S. imperialists' provocations against the Korean people are part of this criminal activity.

The U.S. ruling clique is using the capture of this spy ship to engage in war mobilization and blackmail, on the one hand, deploying troops and strengthening military preparations, and on the other, hysterically issuing war threats. The Johnson administration has already dispatched U.S. military aircraft from Japan and Okinawa to South Korea and has moved the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to Korean waters. It is also taking advantage of the situation to intensify war mobilization at home, ordering U.S. Air Force and Navy reservists to active duty. This is a barefaced policy of war intimidation.

While engaging in shameless war blackmail, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly expressed the hope that the modern revisionist clique will come to its aid, allowing it to escape. The U.S. is also attempting to use the United Nations to cover up its own acts of aggression and to exert pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The shameful history of the United Nations serving as a tool for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea is still fresh in people's minds. If U.S. imperialism attempts to use the United Nations again to serve its policy of aggression against Korea, it will surely be condemned by the people of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "U.S. imperialism is creating tension all over the world in order to achieve its purpose of aggression and enslavement of the peoples of various countries. U.S. imperialism thinks that tension is always to its advantage, but the fact is that the tensions created by the United States have turned against its wishes, serving to mobilize the people of the whole world to oppose the U.S. aggressors."

U.S. imperialism thinks it can intimidate the Korean people with war blackmail, but it has forgotten the lessons it learned in the Korean War. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch new military adventures, it will surely suffer more severe punishment!

    我政府发表声明谴责美帝侵略罪行

    新华社二十八日讯　中华人民共和国政府二十八日发表声明，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                            一九六八年一月二十八日
    一月二十三日，朝鲜人民军海军部队在元山附近海面俘获了一艘侵入朝鲜领海进行间谍活动的美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”。二十七日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明，指出：美帝国主义的这一挑衅，“是又一个悍然违反朝鲜停战协定的行动，是对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的公开侵略”；“朝鲜人民采取了毅然决然的自卫措施，是完全正确的”；“美帝国主义不管怎么做，都决不能掩盖他们丑恶的侵略本质，也吓不倒朝鲜人民。”中国政府和中国人民坚决支持朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民反击美帝国主义猖狂挑衅的正义立场。
    美国军舰闯入朝鲜的领海，进行间谍活动，决非偶然。目前，美国侵略者为了挽救它在越南战场上的败局，正在图谋扩大侵越战争，并且在整个亚洲加紧侵略和战争活动。美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的挑衅事件，就是它的这一罪恶活动的一个组成部分。
    美国统治集团利用这艘间谍船只落网事件正在大搞战争动员和战争讹诈，一面调兵遣将加紧军事部署，一面歇斯底里地发出战争叫嚣。约翰逊政府已经从日本、冲绳抽调美国军用飞机去南朝鲜，把美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”调往朝鲜海面。它并且乘机在国内加紧战争动员，下令美国空军和海军的预备役人员服现役。这是一种赤裸裸的战争恫吓政策。
    美帝国主义在进行无耻的战争讹诈的同时，一再表示希望现代修正主义集团出来帮它的忙，好让它下台。美国还力图通过联合国来掩盖它自己的侵略罪行，并且对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国施加压力。联合国充当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜工具的可耻历史，人们记忆犹新。美帝国主义企图再次利用联合国来为它侵略朝鲜的政策服务，必将遭到全世界人民的谴责。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说过：“美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”
    美帝国主义想用战争讹诈来吓唬朝鲜人民，它忘记了在朝鲜战争中受过的教训。如果美帝国主义胆敢进行新的军事冒险，必将自讨苦吃，遭到更加严厉的惩罚！
