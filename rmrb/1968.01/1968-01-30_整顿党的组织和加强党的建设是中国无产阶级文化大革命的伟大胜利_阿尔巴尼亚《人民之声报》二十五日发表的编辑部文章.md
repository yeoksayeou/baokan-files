The brilliant achievements and victories of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, which are made every day, greatly inspire all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world. The consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist camp in the People's Republic of China is beneficial to the great cause of the world revolution. It inspires the hundreds of millions of laboring people who are fighting against imperialism and its running dogs and striving for socialism and communism, and strengthens their confidence in winning victory.

The good news from China proves that the proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong has entered a new and decisive stage, that is, the stage of achieving comprehensive victories on all fronts. Revolutionary enthusiasm is surging across the whole of China. The great program for rectifying the Party and building the Party has begun to be carried out throughout the country. This is a brilliant symbol of the irresistible torrent of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution surging forward, and a brilliant symbol of the victory of Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary thinking.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong and directly under his leadership, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power have been overthrown, their power has been seized, revolutionary forces have been united, and a revolutionary three-in-one combination has been established, creating favorable conditions for rectifying the Party's organization and strengthening Party building. The cultural revolution is a great test and a thorough examination and profound education for every Party member. Now, the revolutionary masses, cadres, and the broad ranks of Party members who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought are ruthlessly criticizing the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in Party building, and have begun to successfully carry out the great task of rectifying the Party's organization, making the glorious Communist Party of China purer and stronger, as Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions say: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy."

Rectifying the Party's organization is related to China's future and destiny, and to the future and destiny of the revolution in this country. It is a great victory for the Communist Party of China and for all the people of China. It shows that the revolution there has made a big step forward and has risen to a higher stage. The glorious Communist Party of China criticizes China's Khrushchev's line on Party building, rectifies the Party according to Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary line of Party building, and will make the Party stronger and purer, better leading the people of China in the struggle for cultural revolution and socialist construction. The Communist Party of China is the leading and guiding force of the great Chinese people and the Chinese revolution. Through the elimination of traitors, spies, and diehard elements, through the rectification of the Party's organization and the strengthening of Party building, the Party will be tempered to be stronger and will be able to gloriously fulfill its great and historic mission of advancing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The strengthening of the Party will undoubtedly give a new impetus to the whole life of China and will lead to new great revolutionary victories on all fronts.

It is important that: the rectification of the Party's organization is carried out after a thorough criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line and a deep study of Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary teachings on Party building. It will enable Party life to proceed normally and according to Marxist-Leninist principles, establishing a solid foundation in ideology, politics, theory, and organization.

For decades, within the Communist Party of China, there has been a sharp struggle between the Marxist-Leninist line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by China's Khrushchev. This struggle has always revolved around the most important and fundamental question of whether China should take the capitalist road or the socialist road. China's Khrushchev has tried to deny the proletariat's right to lead the Chinese revolution, advocating bourgeois reformism. After 1949, he opposed the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat with his line and actions.

A handful of capitalist-roaders led by China's Khrushchev, in their evil plot to restore capitalism in China, directed their main spearhead and most ferocious attacks against the Communist Party of China. They fiercely opposed Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary line in Party building, advocating a revisionist line of Party building; they tried every means to turn the Party into a revisionist party. China's Khrushchev put forward a whole set of "theories" to justify and shield his counter-revolutionary line. He denied intra-Party struggle, especially the struggle between the two lines. He weakened the Party's line, attempting to ultimately usurp the Party's leadership.

When the cultural revolution was launched to smash the revisionist line of the bourgeois headquarters, China's Khrushchev used his leading position within the Party to mobilize his cronies in the Party organs to suppress the cultural revolution, attempting to lead it astray. He sent work teams to the grassroots, aiming to strike at the revolutionary factions and suppress all those who rose up against the revisionist line of the bourgeois headquarters. A handful of capitalist-roaders, in order to sabotage the cultural revolution initiated by Chairman Mao Zedong, stopped at nothing. They carried out sabotage and suppression, used vicious economic means, advocated individualism, and engaged in slander and intimidation. They advocated false "unity" and "blind obedience." The "unity" they wanted was to betray the revolution, turn the proletarian party into a bourgeois party, and force the masses and Party members to be docile tools in their anti-Party conspiracies.

However, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution smashed China's Khrushchev's plot, overthrew the ruling bourgeois revisionist clique, and shattered the imperialists' and revisionists' dream of "peaceful evolution" and the restoration of capitalism in China. This revolution educated the masses ideologically and politically. In the process of exposing and destroying the reactionary bourgeois line, it tempered the people. Hundreds of millions of people in this process better grasped and applied Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary thinking, and further burned the feudal and bourgeois old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and paved the way for strengthening proletarian socialist new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. In this struggle, the revolutionary consciousness of the need to strengthen the Party, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prevent the restoration of capitalism was heightened.

In the current situation of the international communist movement, the rectification and strengthening of the Party's organization in China is an important experience and a new contribution to Marxism-Leninism. Just as the entire cultural revolution, this work sets a great and inspiring example for the true communists in those countries where the leadership of the Party has been usurped by revisionists. Adhering to the Leninist principles of building the Communist Party is a matter of great significance. It is a necessary condition for overthrowing the revisionist clique that has usurped the leadership and for thoroughly defeating opportunism and revisionism. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the Party is the organized and conscious vanguard of the working class. The Party must be guided by the tested Marxist-Leninist thought in all its activities and must constantly and resolutely struggle against manifestations that are incompatible with it within and outside the Party. The characteristic of the revolutionary party of the working class lies in the unity of thought and action within it. This unity can only be achieved by being vigilant against and constantly struggling against factions, lines, or tendencies that often appear within the Communist Party and at various stages of revolutionary development that deviate from Marxism-Leninism. Democratic centralism, big democracy within the Party, conscious discipline, self-criticism, maintaining contact with the masses, and consistently adhering to the mass line are the solid foundations for building the Communist Party. This solid foundation makes the Communist Party strong and solid, inseparably linked with the people, and enables it to gloriously fulfill its mission of overthrowing the bourgeoisie, building socialism and communism victoriously. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

The great program for rectifying and strengthening the Communist Party of China is another heavy blow to American imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. In the face of this program, their slanders and lies against the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, against the Communist Party of China, and against the People's Republic of China have all burst like soap bubbles. The comprehensive activities currently being carried out in China to rectify the Party's organization best illustrate the determination of the revolutionary masses and the Communist Party members of China to spare no effort to make the Communist Party of China purer, more vigorous, and more consolidated. They follow the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's revolutionary thinking, establish a strong unity, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution.

    整顿党的组织和加强党的建设是中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十五日发表的编辑部文章
    中国无产阶级文化大革命每天取得的辉煌成就和胜利极大地鼓舞了全世界所有马克思列宁主义者和革命人民。中华人民共和国的无产阶级专政和社会主义阵地的巩固有利于世界革命的伟大事业，它鼓舞了正在反对帝国主义及其帮凶和争取社会主义、共产主义的亿万劳动人民，并加强了他们夺取胜利的信心。
    从中国传来的喜讯证明，由毛泽东主席发动和领导的无产阶级文化革命已进入了一个新的决定性阶段，这就是各条战线上取得全面胜利的阶段。全中国到处洋溢着革命的热情。伟大的整党和建党纲领已经开始在全国各地贯彻执行。这是中国无产阶级文化大革命不可抵挡的洪流滚滚向前的光辉标志，这是毛泽东主席的革命思想胜利的光辉标志。
    按照毛泽东主席的教导，并在毛泽东主席的直接领导下，打倒一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、夺他们的权、实现革命力量的大联合和建立革命的三结合，为整顿党的组织和加强党的建设创造了适宜的条件。文化革命对每个党员来说是一场巨大的严峻考验，是一次全面的考察和深刻的教育。现在，忠于毛泽东思想的革命群众、革命干部和广大党员群众，正在无情地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在建党方面的修正主义路线，并且已经开始成功地执行关于整顿党的组织的伟大任务，使光荣的中国共产党变得更加纯洁，更加坚强，正如毛泽东主席最新指示中说的：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”
    整顿党的组织关系到中国的未来和命运，关系到这个国家革命的未来和命运，它对中国共产党和全中国人民来说是一个伟大的胜利。它表明，那里的革命已经前进了一大步，并提高到了一个更高的阶段。光荣的中国共产党批判中国赫鲁晓夫的建党路线，根据毛泽东主席革命的建设路线整党，将使党变得更加强大，更加纯洁，更好地领导人民在中国进行文化革命和社会主义建设的斗争。中国共产党是伟大的中国人民和中国革命的领导和指导力量。中国共产党通过清除叛徒、特务和顽固不化的分子，通过整顿党的组织和加强党组织的建设，将锻炼得更坚强，将能光荣地完成它的伟大的具有历史意义的使命——在无产阶级专政下推进革命。党的加强无疑地将给中国的整个生活以新的推动力，它将导致各个战线上取得新的伟大的革命胜利。
    重要的是：整顿党的组织是在狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线和深入学习毛泽东主席关于建党问题的革命学说之后进行的。它为党的生活能正常地和按照马克思列宁主义准则开展，建立坚实的思想、政治、理论和组织基础。
    几十年来，在中国共产党内，以毛泽东主席为代表的马克思列宁主义路线同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线之间一直进行着一场尖锐的斗争。这场斗争始终围绕着一个最重大的和最根本的问题，即中国应该走什么道路，走资本主义道路还是走社会主义道路的问题。中国赫鲁晓夫竭力否认无产阶级领导中国革命的权利，他推行资产阶级的改良主义，一九四九年后，他以他的路线和行动对抗社会主义革命和无产阶级专政。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资派在企图实现他们在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋中，把他们的主要矛头和最猖狂的攻击指向中国共产党。他们疯狂地反对毛泽东主席在建党方面的革命路线，推行一条修正主义的建党路线；他们千方百计地企图把党变成一个修正主义的党。中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了一整套“理论”，企图为其反革命路线进行辩解和庇护。他否认党内斗争，特别是否认两条路线的斗争。他削弱党的路线，企图最终窃取党的领导。
    当发动了旨在粉碎资产阶级司令部的修正主义路线的文化大革命的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫利用他在党内窃踞的领导地位，调动了他在党的机关内的亲信，拚命地压制文化革命，企图把文化革命引导到歪路上去。他派工作组到基层去，目的在于打击革命派，镇压一切起来造资产阶级司令部修正主义路线的反的人。一小撮走资派为了破坏由毛泽东主席发动的文化革命，无所不用其极。他们进行破坏和镇压，施用经济主义恶毒手段，鼓吹个人利己主义，进行污蔑和恐吓。他们鼓吹虚假的“团结”和“盲目服从”。他们所要的“团结”是为了叛卖革命，把无产阶级政党变成资产阶级政党，并迫使群众和党员在他们的反党阴谋中充当驯服工具。
    但是，中国的无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋，打倒了当权的资产阶级修正主义集团，并使帝国主义者和修正主义者在中国实行“和平演变”、复辟资本主义的美梦破产。这场革命在思想上和政治上教育了群众，它在揭露和摧毁资产阶级反动路线的斗争过程中锻炼了人们。亿万群众在这个过程中更好地掌握和运用毛泽东主席的革命思想，同时进一步焚烧了封建的和资产阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯，并为加强无产阶级社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗和新习惯开辟了道路。在这场斗争中，提高了需要加强党、加强无产阶级专政和加强防止资本主义复辟的斗争的革命自觉性。
    在国际共产主义运动的当前形势下，中国整顿和加强党的组织是一项重要的经验，是对马克思列宁主义的新贡献。正如整个文化革命一样，这项工作给处于党的领导权被修正主义分子篡夺的那些国家中的真正的共产党人树立了令人鼓舞的伟大榜样。贯彻建设共产党的列宁主义原则，是一个具有重大意义的原则问题。这是为推翻篡夺领导权的修正主义集团和彻底战胜机会主义和修正主义所必不可少的条件。马克思列宁主义教导我们，党是工人阶级的有组织的和有觉悟的先锋队。党在自己的全部活动中都要以久经考验的马克思列宁主义思想为指导，并且不断地同党内外的格格不入的表现进行坚决的斗争。工人阶级革命政党的特点在于内部的思想和行动的一致。这种一致只有通过对往往表现在共产党内部的和在革命发展的各个阶段中同马克思列宁主义相背离的派别、路线或倾向保持警惕和进行不断斗争才能实现。民主集中制、内部的大民主、自觉的纪律性、自我批评、同群众的联系和始终不渝地贯彻群众路线，是建立共产党大厦的坚实基础。这一坚实的基础使共产党变得强大和坚固，同人民不可分割地联系在一起，并使她能够光荣地完成推翻资产阶级，胜利地建设社会主义和共产主义的光荣使命。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    整顿和加强中国共产党的伟大纲领是对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的又一沉重的打击。在这项纲领面前，它们对中国无产阶级文化大革命，对中国共产党，对中华人民共和国的诽谤和谎言都象肥皂泡一样破灭了。中国目前为整顿党的组织开展的全面活动，最好不过地说明中国的革命群众、中国共产党员决心尽一切努力，使中国共产党变得更加纯洁、更加有生气和更加巩固。他们遵循马克思列宁主义的教导，高举毛泽东革命思想的大旗，建立坚强的团结，夺取文化革命的全面胜利。（新华社地拉那二十九日电）
