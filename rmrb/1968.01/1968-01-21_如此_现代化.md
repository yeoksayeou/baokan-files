Such "Modernization"

The Soviet revisionist leadership has recently been vigorously promoting in their publications the idea of making Soviet youth into so-called "modernized people." According to them, to be a "modernized person" means to be a "strong and powerful person," an "optimistic person," a "cultured person," and a "beautiful person."

But what exactly does the Soviet revisionist clique mean by "modernization"? A look at their propaganda in the newspapers reveals the truth.

They call the bizarre and grotesque "fashion" of the Western world "modernized" clothing, advocating how to use "modernized" clothing and shoes to make up for physical defects.

They call the vulgar jazz music of the West "modern" music, and the lascivious twist dance of the West "modernized" social dance. They even criticize some young people for not being able to dance the "modernized" dance, calling it a "defect" and "not modernized."

They call the lowbrow and worthless poisonous weeds written by the hooligan poets like Yevtushenko "modern poetry," and praise them to the skies, making it an honor for young people to be able to recite a few of these "modern poems."

And so on, the list goes on.

It is obvious that in the eyes of the Soviet revisionist clique, not being able to appreciate jazz music means lacking culture; not dressing according to Parisian fashion means lacking beauty; only keeping up with the "fashion" of the capitalist world can be considered "optimistic" and "strong and powerful." From this, it can be seen that their so-called "modernization" is thoroughly capitalist, thoroughly Westernized. They call on Soviet youth to take on the task of being "modernized people," which is nothing more than asking the next generation of the Soviet Union to align with the young masters and misses of the West. However, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like have the audacity to say that doing so is "completely in line with the great goals of communists." This is because the "great goals" of these traitors, who wear the label of communists, is to fully and thoroughly achieve the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

Since the Soviet revisionist clique wants to turn back the clock, making socialist Soviet Union regress to a capitalist society, and sees today's America as their tomorrow, it is no wonder that they regard the most decadent and corrupt things of capitalist countries as the most "modernized" holy objects, yearning for them endlessly and bowing down to them.

### 如此“现代化”

    如此“现代化”
    苏修领导集团近来在报刊上竭力鼓吹，要苏联的青年做所谓“现代化人”。据他们说，要做“现代化人”，就是要做“强而有力的人”，“乐观的人”，“有教养的人”，“优美的人”。
    究竟苏修集团心目中的“现代化”的含义是什么呢？看看他们在报刊上的宣传，便知端详。
    他们把西方世界的奇形怪状的“时装”，叫做“现代化”服装，宣扬如何用“现代化”服装、鞋子来弥补体形的缺陷。
    他们把西方的下流的爵士乐称为“现代”音乐，把西方的淫荡的摇摆舞叫做“现代化”交际舞，甚至指责一些青年跳不好“现代化舞”，是“有缺陷”、“不现代化”。
    他们把叶夫图申柯之流的阿飞诗人所写的低级无聊的毒草名之为“现代诗”，把它们捧上了天，让青年们以能背诵几首这类“现代诗”为荣。
    如此等等，不一而足。
    很显然，在苏修集团看来，不会欣赏爵士乐，不会跳摇摆舞，就是没有教养；不按照巴黎的时装打扮就是不优美；只有赶上资本主义世界的“时髦”，才算是“乐观”和“强而有力”。由此可见，他们的所谓“现代化”，就是彻头彻尾的资本主义化，就是地地道道的西方化。他们号召苏联青年以做“现代化人”为己任，不过是要苏联的下一代向西方世界的少爷小姐看齐罢了。然而勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流居然厚颜无耻地说什么，这样做是“完全符合共产党人的伟大目标”的。这是因为他们这伙打着共产党员招牌的叛徒的“伟大目标”，就是要在苏联全面彻底地实现资本主义复辟。
    苏修集团既然是要倒拨时针，使社会主义苏联倒退到资本主义社会去，把美国的今天看作是他们的明天，那末他们把资本主义国家最腐朽没落的东西视为最“现代化”的圣物，对之无限向往，五体投地，这又有什么奇怪呢？
