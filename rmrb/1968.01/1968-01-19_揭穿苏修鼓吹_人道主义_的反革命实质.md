Since the notorious 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Khrushchev revisionist clique has consistently used "humanitarianism" as a central slogan to implement their counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the cultural sphere. Recently, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionists, *Pravda*, published an article reiterating the hackneyed phrase that "communism is the embodiment of humanitarianism" and absurdly claiming that Soviet culture, by raising the banner of "humanitarianism," has become an "important factor" in "building communism."

This is sheer counter-revolutionary nonsense.

Everyone knows that humanitarianism emerged as a trend during the European Renaissance. It played a certain role in the bourgeois enlightenment movement of that time. However, humanitarianism has always been a bourgeois worldview, with nothing in common with the proletarian worldview—scientific communism. Bourgeois humanitarianism, under the guise of "everything centered on man," uses abstract notions of "love for humanity" and "universal common human nature" and other lies to obscure the class contradictions of capitalist society, to conceal the reactionary essence of the bourgeoisie's ruthless exploitation and oppression of the working people; it is a spiritual opium used by the bourgeoisie to enslave and rule the broad masses of working people, to numb and disintegrate their will to struggle. The Soviet revisionist clique's claim that such a thoroughly bourgeois slogan is a "communist" slogan, and their repeated emphasis that Soviet culture and literature and art must take humanitarianism as their "basic theme," once again shows that they are shameful traitors to scientific communism, shameful traitors to the proletariat.

The "humanitarianism" advocated by the Soviet revisionists is purely a counter-revolutionary ideological weapon. They buy and use all sorts of reactionary bourgeois writers to produce a large number of poisonous films, novels, plays, poems, and so on, hysterically shouting "Long live the love of all people!" "Humanitarianism... will live forever!" and so on, claiming that "we are all human," "man is man's friend, comrade, and brother" and so forth. In reality, their purpose is to oppose the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, to carry out a full-scale capitalist restoration, and to consolidate the reactionary rule of revisionism.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought teach us: after the proletariat seizes power, the overthrown landlord and bourgeoisie will never reconcile themselves to their destruction. They will always try every means to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to restore the paradise they have already lost. The proletariat, in order to defend the fruits of the revolution, must implement dictatorship over the overthrown class enemies, resolutely smash their various plots for restoration, and absolutely not talk about equality with them, give them freedom, or address them as brothers.

However, the Soviet revisionist clique in literature and art has been propagating the counter-revolutionary fallacies of "we are all human" and "long live the love of all people," attacking and defaming proletarian dictatorship. They falsify history, distort facts, and openly declare that the struggles of the Soviet people to defend proletarian dictatorship against class enemies are all "inhumane" products of "personal cult." For example, in Sholokhov's *The Virgin Soil Upturned* and Stanyukovich's *Man Is Not an Angel*, which take the Soviet rural collectivization movement of the late 1920s and early 1930s as their theme, they on the one hand insinuate that the struggle of the Bolshevik Party against the Trotskyite and Bukharinite counter-revolutionary cliques is "slandering good people," and on the other hand openly slander the elimination of the kulak class as resulting in a "pitiful" outcome. In a series of reactionary works such as Nikolayeva's *Battles on the Road Forward* and Solzhenitsyn's *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*, they completely negate the struggle to purge counter-revolutionaries in 1937, claiming that it was a "cruelly inhumane" practice. In some of Ehrenburg's counter-revolutionary memoirs, the most venomous language is used to curse the entire Soviet society from the October Revolution to the rise of the Khrushchev revisionist clique as being filled with "unprecedented cruelty" and "injustice," and to slander the proletarian dictatorship's socialist system as "lacking in humanity." In Sholokhov's *The Fate of a Man*, Tvardovsky's *The House by the Roadside*, and Aitmatov's *The First Teacher*, and other so-called works that handle the theme of war from the perspective of "new humanitarianism," they actually depict the great anti-fascist war as a "tragedy of humanity" and a "disaster," as "brothers killing each other."

In short, in the eyes of Soviet revisionist writers, the entire proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship are "inhumane" "tragedies," and only allowing the overthrown landlord and bourgeoisie to climb back onto the heads of the working people to lord it over them, willingly enduring the aggression and slaughter of imperialism, conforms to the principles of "humanitarianism"! Isn't the counter-revolutionary essence of the Soviet revisionists' so-called "humanitarianism" quite clear?

The "humanitarianism" advocated by the Soviet revisionists is not only extremely reactionary but also extremely hypocritical. All their talk of "everything for man" and "man is man's friend, comrade, and brother" is sheer nonsense. Countless facts prove: their so-called "everything for man" is everything for a handful of representatives of the reactionary classes; their "friends, comrades, and brothers" are, in reality, the American imperialists and all their accomplices and running dogs.

It is well known that Yesenin, Tsvetaeva, Pnin, Zoshchenko, Akhmatova, and Pasternak were all reactionary writers who, after the October Revolution, were despised by the Soviet people for their stubborn hostility to the proletarian state and their mad counter-revolutionary activities. However, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist clique eagerly restored their "reputation," praising these heaps of filth as "outstanding representatives" of Soviet culture; they said this was a "victory" for "humanitarianism" and "humanity." This is utterly shameless!

Even more outrageous, in recent years, a group of literary lackeys of the Soviet revisionists have been particularly eager to propagate: Hitler's fascists "are also human"; the leaders of the American ruling clique also "love peace" and "care about the fate of humanity." Simonov, through the protagonist in *Soldiers Are Not Born*, eagerly beautifies German fascist officers as "sharing the fate of soldiers" and "very good, very outstanding" soldiers, claiming that executing them is a "brutality" that makes his own "conscience" feel "painful." Bekov's poisonous novel *The Third Flare* and *The Trap*, and others, shamelessly advocate the "kindness" and "humanity" of the fascist invading army, and wail for their deaths. Ehrenburg's *Man, Years, Life* openly praises the "humanity," "wisdom," and "progress" of the American ruling class, calling for "peace" with the war criminals Truman and Acheson. Yevtushenko, this despicable jester, has written a large number of reactionary political poems, repeatedly expressing his desire to "share the fate" with American imperialism. As for the farce of praising someone like Kipling, who was a mouthpiece for imperialist aggression, as a "humanitarian" and even worshipping him as a teacher, it has long been a common phenomenon in the Soviet revisionist cultural circles. Look, isn't the so-called "humanitarianism" of the Soviet revisionists openly and shamelessly seeking to befriend, be comrades, and be brothers with the most reactionary fascists and imperialists led by the United States?

As early as more than half a century ago, Engels pointed out: "There are still people today who, from a neutral, high-and-mighty standpoint, preach to the workers a socialism that stands above all class antagonisms and class struggles, and these people, if they are not still learning, are the most vicious enemies of the workers, wolves in sheep's clothing." The Soviet revisionists are certainly not "still learning"; they have long betrayed the cause of scientific communism and have consistently and madly opposed Marxism-Leninism, opposed the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. They are genuine "most vicious enemies of the workers," genuine "wolves in sheep's clothing."

    揭穿苏修鼓吹“人道主义”的反革命实质
    樊秀文
    从臭名昭著的苏共第二十次代表大会开始，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团就一直把“人道主义”作为他们在文化领域里贯彻反革命修正主义路线的一个中心口号。不久前，苏修集团的喉舌《真理报》又发表文章，重弹“共产主义”是“人道主义的化身”的滥调，并且荒诞地宣称苏联文化因为高举“人道主义的旗帜”而成了“建设共产主义”的“重要因素”。
    这完全是一派反革命的胡言乱语。
    大家知道，人道主义是在欧洲文艺复兴时期出现的一种思潮。它在当时的资产阶级启蒙运动中曾经起过一定的作用。但是，人道主义从来就是资产阶级的世界观，它和无产阶级的世界观——科学共产主义毫无共同之处。资产阶级人道主义，打着“一切以人为中心”的幌子，用抽象的“人类之爱”和“普遍的共同人性”等种种谎言，抹煞资本主义社会的阶级矛盾，掩盖资产阶级残酷剥削和压迫劳动人民的反动本质；它是资产阶级奴役和统治广大劳动人民，麻痹和瓦解他们的斗争意志的一种精神鸦片。苏修集团把这样一个彻头彻尾的资产阶级口号说成是“共产主义”的口号，而且反复强调苏联文化和文学艺术必须以人道主义作为“基本主题”，这就再一次表明他们是科学共产主义的可耻叛徒，是无产阶级的可耻叛徒。
    苏修集团鼓吹的“人道主义”，完全是一种反革命的思想武器。他们收买和利用形形色色的资产阶级反动文人，炮制大量的毒草影片、小说、戏剧、诗歌等等，歇斯底里地叫嚷“一切人的博爱万岁！”“人道主义……永垂不朽！”胡说什么“我们都是人”，“人对人是朋友、同志和兄弟”……如此等等。拆穿来说，其目的就是为了反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，实行全面资本主义复辟，巩固修正主义的反动统治。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教导我们：在无产阶级取得政权以后，被推翻的地主资产阶级决不会甘心于自己的灭亡，他们总是千方百计地进行反革命活动，企图恢复他们已经失去的天堂。无产阶级为了保卫革命果实，就必须对被推翻的阶级敌人实行专政，坚决粉碎他们的各种复辟阴谋，而决不能跟他们讲什么平等，给他们自由，更不能同他们称兄道弟。
    但是，苏修集团在文学艺术中却大肆宣扬“我们都是人”、“一切人的博爱万岁”等反革命谬论，攻击和丑化无产阶级专政。他们篡改历史，歪曲事实，公然把苏联人民为了捍卫无产阶级专政同阶级敌人进行的斗争，一概说成是“不人道”的“个人迷信的产物”。例如肖洛霍夫的《被开垦的处女地》和斯塔纽克的《人不是天使》等小说，都以二十年代末三十年代初苏联农村集体化运动为题材，一方面影射攻击布尔什维克党同托洛茨基、布哈林反革命集团的斗争是“诬伤好人”，另一方面公然诽谤消灭富农阶级造成“凄惨”的“结局”。尼古拉耶娃的《前进道路上的战斗》和索尔仁尼津的《伊凡·杰尼索维奇的一天》等一系列的反动作品，则全盘否定一九三七年肃清反革命的斗争，胡说什么那是一种“惨无人道”的做法。爱伦堡的一些反革命回忆录更是使用最刻毒的语言，诅咒十月革命以后赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团上台以前整个苏联社会都充满“史所未闻”的“残忍”和“不正义”，诬蔑无产阶级专政的社会主义制度“缺乏人性”。而在肖洛霍夫的《一个人的遭遇》、特瓦尔朵夫斯基的《路旁的房屋》和艾特玛托夫的《大地——母亲》等等所谓从“新的人道主义的观点”来处理战争题材的毒草作品中，竟然把伟大的反法西斯战争描绘成是“人类的悲剧”和“灾难”，是“兄弟的自相残杀”。
    总之，在苏修文人们的笔下，整个无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政都是“不人道”的“悲剧”，只有让被推翻的地主资产阶级重新爬在劳动人民头上作威作福，心甘情愿地忍受帝国主义的侵略、残杀，才符合“人道主义”的原则！苏修集团所谓“人道主义”的反革命本质，不是十分清楚的吗？
    苏修集团宣扬的“人道主义”不仅是极端反动的，也是绝顶虚伪的。什么“一切为了人”呀，“人对人是朋友、同志和兄弟”呀，统统都是些骗人的鬼话。无数的事实证明：他们所谓的“一切为了人”，就是一切为了一小撮反动阶级的代表人物；他们心目中的“朋友、同志和兄弟”，说穿了，就是美帝国主义及其一切帮凶和走狗。
    人所共知，叶赛宁、茨威塔耶娃、莆宁、左琴柯、阿赫玛托娃和帕斯捷尔纳克等等，都是十月革命以后因为顽固敌视无产阶级政权，疯狂进行反革命活动而早已被苏联人民唾弃的反动文人。但是，在苏共二十大以后，苏修集团迫不及待地纷纷为他们恢复“名誉”，把这些不齿于人类的狗屎堆一个个都吹捧为苏联文化的“优秀代表”；他们还说什么这是“人道主义”和
  “人性”的“胜利”。真是无耻透顶！
    更有甚者，苏修集团的一批文坛走卒，近年来还特别卖力地宣传：希特勒法西斯分子“也是人”；美国统治集团的头目们也同样“爱好和平”、“关心人类的命运”。西蒙诺夫通过《军人不是天生的》里的主人公，竭力美化德国法西斯军官是“与士兵共命运”、“很好、很出色”的军人，胡说什么枪毙他们是一种“残暴”，连自己的“良心”都因此“感到苦痛”。贝柯夫的毒草小说《第三个信号弹》和《圈套》等等，则厚颜无耻地宣扬法西斯侵略军的“善良”和“人性”，为他们的死亡而失声哀嚎。爱伦堡的《人·岁月·生活》公然吹捧美国统治阶级的“人性”、“明智”和“进步”，叫嚷必须同发动侵略战争的罪犯杜鲁门和艾奇逊之流讲“和平”。叶甫图申柯这个卑贱的小丑，更是写了大量的反动政治诗歌，一再表示要和美帝国主义“共命运”。至于把象吉卜林这样的帝国主义侵略政策的吹鼓手当作“人道主义者”而加以百般颂扬，甚至拜他们为师等等丑剧，早已是苏修文化界司空见惯的现象了。请看，苏修的所谓“人道主义”不是公然无耻地要同世界上最反动的法西斯和以美国为首的帝国主义交朋友、称同志、结兄弟，又是什么？！
    早在半个多世纪以前，恩格斯就曾经一针见血地指出：“现在也还有这样一些人，他们从不偏不倚的高高在上的观点向工人鼓吹一种凌驾于一切阶级对立和阶级斗争之上的社会主义，这些人如果不是还需要多多学习的新手，就是工人的最凶恶的敌人，披着羊皮的豺狼。”苏修集团当然不是什么“新手”，他们早已背叛科学共产主义事业，一贯疯狂反对马克思列宁主义，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。他们是道道地地的“工人的最凶恶的敌人”，是货真价实的“披着羊皮的豺狼”。
