The children of Jinggangshan, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, enthusiastically cheered the birth of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and solemnly declared: Immediately, in the entire province, we will launch a more extensive and in-depth campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let the red flag of Jinggangshan, which Chairman Mao personally raised, fly high and forever! We sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

On the night of the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, 2,000 proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and athletes from Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City held a torch relay around the city, symbolizing the children of Jinggangshan holding high the torch of revolution to report the good news to Chairman Mao. In the cities and countryside of Jinggangshan and the surrounding 13 counties and cities, large and small celebrations were held. In Ninggang County at the foot of Jinggangshan, 2,000 proletarian revolutionaries, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary students gathered at the Red Army Square, where Chairman Mao once reviewed the Red Army, to warmly celebrate the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee. In the former revolutionary base areas of Ruijin and Xingguo, revolutionary masses held grand celebrations.

The revolutionary people of Jiangxi, while celebrating the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee, deeply understood that the establishment of the committee is "only the first step of the long march." The tasks ahead are more glorious, more arduous, and more magnificent. The most fundamental task is to launch a more extensive and in-depth campaign to study and apply the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, to establish Mao Zedong thought study classes, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the day after the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all members of the committee went to various factories, shops, and suburban villages in the province and city, worked with workers and peasants, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together, and propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The broad revolutionary masses of Xingguo launched a new high tide of the campaign to study and apply the thoughts of Mao Zedong before and after the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, from the county, commune, brigade to the production team, and are carrying out activities to summarize and exchange experiences in running Mao Zedong thought study classes well. The proletarian revolutionaries of the revolutionary cradle Jinggangshan, at the celebration meeting for the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, did the first big thing, which was to present Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolutionary masses of the red coal city of Anshan Mine, to welcome and celebrate the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, launched a campaign to study and discuss the New Year's editorials of the "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and "Liberation Army Daily," to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item, and to promote revolution and production. This mine, on the basis of over-fulfilling the coal production plan for December last year, has seen a new situation of production rising every day this year. The revolutionary people of the whole province solemnly declared: Under the guidance of the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, we will definitely further carry forward and develop the revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, and turn the first red base area personally created by Chairman Mao into a red school of Mao Zedong thought.

The joyous news of the birth of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee greatly encouraged the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangxi. From barracks and sentry posts to the front lines of "three-in-one" and "two-in-one," everywhere was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and cheers. The cadres and soldiers held celebration meetings and parades, shouting thousands of times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The joyous news reached the 601st Unit, and the cadres and soldiers were overjoyed, and their revolutionary spirit was more ardent. This heroic unit, which made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi, launched a campaign to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials of the "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and "Liberation Army Daily," and to learn from the shining deeds of the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong. Everyone is determined to make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi. All cadres and soldiers of the 6th Company, where Li Wenzhong was stationed, to celebrate the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee and to welcome new combat tasks, seriously summarized the experience of supporting the left. They felt that there are thousands and thousands of experiences, but the most fundamental one is to always put learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's great instructions in the first place in all work. "Chairman Mao loves me, I love; Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance," this is their common oath. They had a discussion with the local proletarian revolutionaries, humbly listened to the demands and opinions of the revolutionary masses, and expressed their determination to continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionaries and make new contributions in the "three-in-one" and "two-in-one." The cadres and soldiers supporting the left in the Pingxiang Mine, before and after the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, took the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong as examples, went deep into the workers, did thorough, detailed, and arduous ideological work, went down to the underground mine with the workers to participate in production, propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and made the mine area present a new situation.

The cadres and soldiers of the 6812th Unit, who are fighting in the Jinggangshan area, held a grand meeting to celebrate the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee. They summarized the experience of supporting the left in the Jinggangshan area, immediately organized a small team, and went deep into various places and units to check the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the execution of the agreement on supporting the left and loving the people.

The broad cadres and soldiers of various units, while celebrating the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The cadres and soldiers expressed their determination to heighten revolutionary vigilance, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, better protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate national defense, and let the red flag of Jinggangshan fly forever.
