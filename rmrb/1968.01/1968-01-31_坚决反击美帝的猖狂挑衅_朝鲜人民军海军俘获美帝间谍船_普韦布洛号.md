On January 23, the Korean People's Army Navy forces captured a U.S. armed spy ship, the "Pueblo," which had intruded into Korean territorial waters for espionage activities near Wonsan. Several U.S. aggressors were killed and wounded, and over eighty were taken prisoner.

The U.S. aggressors, in an attempt to salvage their failing situation in the Vietnam War, are plotting to expand the war in Vietnam and intensify their aggression and war activities across Asia. The U.S. imperialists' provocations against the Korean people are part of these criminal activities. The U.S. ruling clique is using the "Pueblo" incident to engage in war mobilization and blackmail, deploying troops and military equipment while hysterically issuing war threats. They are openly threatening the heroic Korean people, who have been tested by war.

The Chinese government and people firmly support the Korean government and people in their just stand against the U.S. imperialists' brazen provocations. If the U.S. imperialists dare to launch new military adventures, they will surely suffer and face even more severe punishment!

    坚决反击美帝的猖狂挑衅
    ——朝鲜人民军海军俘获美帝间谍船“普韦布洛号”
    一月二十三日，朝鲜人民军海军部队在元山附近海面俘获了一艘侵入朝鲜领海进行间谍活动的美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”，打死打伤美国侵略军数名，生俘八十多名。
    美国侵略者为了挽救它在越南战场上的败局，正在图谋扩大侵越战争，并且在整个亚洲加紧侵略和战争活动。美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的挑衅事件，就是它的这一罪恶活动的一个组成部分。美国统治集团利用“普韦布洛号”落网事件，正在大搞战争动员和战争讹诈，一面调兵遣将加紧军事部署，一面歇斯底里地发出战争叫嚣，对久经战争考验的英雄的朝鲜人民，进行露骨的战争威胁。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决支持朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民反击美帝国主义猖狂挑衅的正义立场。如果美帝国主义胆敢进行新的军事冒险，必将自讨苦吃，遭到更加严厉的惩罚！（附图片）
