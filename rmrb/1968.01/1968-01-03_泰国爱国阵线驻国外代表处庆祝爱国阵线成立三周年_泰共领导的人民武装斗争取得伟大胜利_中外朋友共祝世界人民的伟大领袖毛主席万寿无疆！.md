The Thai Patriotic Front's Overseas Representative Office held a reception in Beijing today to celebrate the third anniversary of the Front's establishment. The reception was filled with a spirit of combat and unity. Chinese and foreign friends repeatedly raised their glasses, toasting to the long life of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and wishing the armed struggle of the Thai people greater victories.

The Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo, and Liu Ningyi, attended the reception at the invitation.

Paron Chularat, the representative of the Thai Patriotic Front's Overseas Representative Office, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo spoke at the reception.

Paron Chularat introduced the great victories achieved in the armed struggle of the Thai people. He said that the Thai people's revolution has been able to develop correctly and steadily because it is led by the core of the proletarian revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought—the Communist Party of Thailand. The Thai people's revolution has been able to gradually achieve victories and develop because the Thai people have grasped the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Paron said that the Communist Party of Thailand, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, which has universal significance for the revolution, has resolutely implemented the line of mobilizing the peasants to establish rural base areas, persisting in people's war, and surrounding the cities from the countryside to ultimately seize political power. This is the only correct path to achieving Thailand's independence, democracy, and liberation. Mao Zedong Thought has tremendous power. Studying contemporary Marxism-Leninism's peak—Mao Zedong Thought—is extremely important for the people of the patriotic revolution.

Paron strongly condemned the U.S.-Thanom clique and the revisionist traitor clique for colluding to adopt a reactionary two-faced policy, using so-called "constitution," "political parties," and "elections" to deceive the people and attempt to make the patriotic armed forces abandon armed struggle and surrender to them. He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed forces of the Thai people have smashed the enemy's encirclement and dealt a heavy blow to the political deception of the U.S.-Thanom clique. In his speech, he also strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionists who attempt to split the patriotic democratic movement in Thailand.

Paron said that the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has made China an unshakable stronghold of the world's revolutionary people. The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has shaken the world, pushing the world people's revolution forward by a big step. China is the center of the world revolution. The Thai people wish their brotherly Chinese people even greater victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo warmly praised the armed struggle of the Thai people, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, which has achieved brilliant victories by following the path of armed seizure of power and surrounding the cities from the countryside as pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao. Practice has proven that the path chosen by the Thai people is the only correct path to liberation. This is a victory of people's war, a victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

He said that the armed struggle of the Thai people has fundamentally shaken the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique, dealt a severe blow to the U.S. imperialists' evil attempt to expand the war in Vietnam, and powerfully supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. It has made an important contribution to the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national liberation.

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo strongly condemned the collusion of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Thanom reactionary clique in suppressing and sabotaging the revolutionary cause of the Thai people. He said that the Thai people have deeply felt through their struggle that to oppose U.S. imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Thanom clique, they must also wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Thanom reactionary clique are all paper tigers in the face of the armed Thai people. The doomsday of the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique is at hand.

In discussing the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, he said that our great socialist motherland has become an increasingly powerful stronghold of the world revolution. We will certainly more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world to strive for the total liberation of humanity. The Thai Patriotic Front's serious study of the great Mao Zedong Thought and its enthusiastic support for the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat are a great encouragement to us. The Chinese people firmly support the armed struggle of the Thai people against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and the rule of the Thanom puppet clique. The heroic Thai people, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly achieve final victory by persisting in a long people's war.

Sani, representing the former Thai Regent Pridi Phanomyong, also spoke at the reception. She said that Thailand belongs to the Thai people and cannot be allowed to be turned into a colony of U.S. imperialism by the Thanom-Praphat clique. The Thai people are determined to use revolutionary armed struggle to oppose counter-revolutionary armed struggle. The Thai people have made up their minds to overcome all difficulties and sacrifices and will certainly achieve final victory.

Those invited to the reception also included Albanian Ambassador to China Natanaeli, Nguyen Van Khoa, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Ly Chung Chi, chargé d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Chahro, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau Senanayake, representatives of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China and the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, as well as other foreign friends.

    新华社二日讯　泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表处今天在北京举行招待会，热烈庆祝泰国爱国阵线成立三周年。
    在充满战斗团结气氛的招待会上，中外朋友不断举杯，敬祝世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，祝泰国人民的武装斗争取得更大胜利。
    人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、刘宁一，应邀出席了招待会。
    泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖和郭沫若副委员长，在招待会上讲了话。
    帕荣·朱拉暖介绍了泰国人民武装斗争所取得的伟大胜利。他说，泰国人民的革命所以能够正确和稳步地发展，是因为她是由马克思列宁主义武装起来的高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命的党——泰国共产党作为领导核心的。泰国人民的革命所以能够逐步地取得胜利和发展，是因为泰国人民掌握了“枪杆子里面出政权”这个真理。
    帕荣说，泰国共产党根据对革命具有普遍指导意义的毛泽东思想，坚决执行了发动农民建立农村根据地，坚持人民战争，以农村包围城市、最后夺取政权的路线。这是争取泰国的独立、民主和解放的唯一正确的道路。毛泽东思想具有强大的威力，学习当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想，对于爱国革命的人民是极端重要的。
    帕荣强烈谴责美国—他侬集团与修正主义叛徒集团相勾结，采用反动的两面政策，搞所谓“宪法”、“政党”和“选举”这些东西，欺骗人民，企图使爱国人民武装放弃武装斗争，向他们投降。他说，在泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装力量，以粉碎敌人的围剿，沉重地回击了美国—他侬集团的政治大骗局。他在讲话中还强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者力图分裂泰国的爱国民主运动。
    帕荣说，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使中国成为世界革命人民的永不变色的强大堡垒。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利凯歌震撼了全世界，把世界人民的革命大大地向前推进了一步。中国是世界革命的中心。泰国人民祝兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中获得更加伟大的胜利。
    郭沫若副委员长热烈赞扬说，泰国人民的武装斗争在泰国共产党的领导下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席所指出的武装夺取政权、农村包围城市的道路，取得了辉煌胜利。实践证明，泰国人民所选择的这一道路是争取解放的唯一正确的道路。这是人民战争的胜利，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利。
    他说，泰国人民的武装斗争从根本上动摇着美国—他侬集团的反动统治，严重地打击了美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的罪恶企图，有力地支援了越南人民的抗美救国战争，对亚、非、拉人民争取民族解放的斗争作出了重要的贡献。
    郭沫若副委员长强烈谴责美帝、苏修和他侬集团相勾结，镇压和破坏泰国人民的革命事业。他说，泰国人民从斗争中深刻地体会到，要反对美帝国主义、推翻他侬集团的反动统治，就必须同时对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义作坚决的斗争。美帝、苏修和他侬反动派，在武装的泰国人民面前，统统都是纸老虎。帝修反的末日已经迫在眼前了。
    他在谈到我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利时说，我们伟大的社会主义祖国已日益成为强大的世界革命堡垒，我们一定会更加有力地支援亚、非、拉和世界各国人民的革命斗争，争取全人类的总解放。泰国爱国阵线对伟大的毛泽东思想的认真学习和对中国无产阶级文化大革命的热情支持，是对于我们的很大的鼓励。中国人民坚决支持泰国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和他侬傀儡集团统治的武装斗争。英勇的泰国人民在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，坚持长期的人民战争，必将取得最后的胜利。
    泰国前摄政王比里·帕侬荣的代表莎尼也在招待会上讲话。她说，泰国是泰国人民的，决不能让美帝国主义的仆从他侬—巴博集团把泰国作为美帝国主义的殖民地，泰国人民决心用革命的武装斗争来反对反革命的武装。泰国人民下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，就一定能够争取到最后胜利。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始，亚非记协总书记查禾多，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团和巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处的负责人，以及其他外国朋友。
