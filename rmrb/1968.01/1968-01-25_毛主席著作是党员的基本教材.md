Chairman Mao's Works Are the Basic Textbooks for Party Members

Deputy Chief of Staff Dàn Sīmǐn, Organization Section Chief Suí Yǒng Jǔ

With what ideology should we educate Party members? This is a fundamental question concerning the kind of party we are building. For a long time, our Party has been engaged in a sharp struggle between two lines over this issue.

Communist Party members must strive for communism. This requires Party members to truly become advanced elements of the proletariat who serve the people wholeheartedly, and become new people of communism who are open-hearted, loyal, active, and put revolutionary interests first. Such Communist Party members can only be cultivated through Mao Zedong Thought. However, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously opposes using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members. He falsely claims, "The Party member's textbook should be more colloquial, and should not quote Chairman Mao's words; just use the textbook's words." This is utterly reactionary nonsense. What does he mean by "more colloquial"? Chairman Mao's books are written for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to liberate themselves and seek emancipation. They are red classics that guide the liberation of the proletariat and all humanity. Chairman Mao's words are the highest principles guiding our thoughts and actions. Chairman Mao's books are the deepest, most colloquial, and most affectionate. Chairman Mao's books are understood and applied by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our troops have many soldiers with very low cultural levels, but they can still actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. Great Mao Zedong Thought has cultivated them into outstanding Communist Party members. This gives the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face!

Let me tell you, Chinese Khrushchev! Your trick of "being more colloquial" is easily exposed. Everyone knows that the issue is not about whether something is "colloquial" or not. You are desperately opposing the broad masses of Party members from studying Chairman Mao's works. To achieve your plot, you can say any lie, truly shameless to the extreme!

The Chinese Khrushchev desperately opposes including Chairman Mao's words in Party member textbooks and resists Party members from studying Chairman Mao's works, with the goal of stuffing his revisionist goods into the minds of Party members. Using the black "Cultivation" as a Party member textbook will turn Party members into selfish individuals who seek fame and profit, harm others for personal gain, and are cowardly; it will turn the Party into a revisionist party, a fascist party, and a tool for the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism. His intentions are so malicious!

We must use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks for educating Party members. Over the past few years, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, we have deeply carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among Party members, cadres, and soldiers. We strive to ensure that our hands do not leave Chairman Mao's books, our mouths do not leave Chairman Mao's words, and our actions do not leave Chairman Mao's teachings. We regard reading Chairman Mao's books as the first necessity in life. It is precisely because of this that many Party branches have become strong fortresses that hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Broad masses of Party members and revolutionary people continuously raise their class consciousness and strive to transform their worldviews. Many old cadres, day after day, work diligently for the revolution, loyally, tirelessly, without complaining, and are willing to be revolutionaries for life; old soldiers who have served beyond their terms work diligently for the revolution, toiling hard, and become the backbone force; a large number of new soldiers, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, grow rapidly. In the struggle between the two classes and two lines, many Party members and non-Party comrades have become steadfast fighters in learning, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Facts have proven that only by educating Party members with Mao Zedong Thought and arming their minds with it, can Party members truly become, as Chairman Mao taught, "models in brave fighting, executing orders, observing discipline, political work, and internal unity and solidarity," and become advanced elements of the proletariat. The more the Chinese Khrushchev desperately opposes us from studying Chairman Mao's works, mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's works. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    毛主席著作是党员的基本教材
    副参谋长　澹思敏　组织股长　隋永举
    用什么思想来教育党员？这是关系到建设什么样的党的根本问题。围绕着这个问题，长时期来我们党内存在着两条路线的尖锐的斗争。
    共产党员要为共产主义而奋斗，这就要求党员真正成为“全心全意地为人民服务”的无产阶级先进分子，成为“襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命”的共产主义新人。这样的共产党员，只有用毛泽东思想才能培养出来。而中国赫鲁晓夫却恶毒地反对用毛泽东思想教育党员。他胡说什么“党员课本要通俗一点，不要摘引毛主席的话，就当课本上的话说。”这是反动透顶的黑话。什么“通俗”一点！？毛主席的书，是为我们广大工农兵翻身求解放写的，是指引无产阶级和全人类解放的红色宝书。毛主席的话，是指导我们思想和行动的最高准则。毛主席的书，最深刻，最通俗，最亲切。毛主席的书，我们广大工农兵、广大共产党员一读就懂，一用就灵。我们部队有很多战士本来文化水平很低，但他们照样能够活学活用毛主席著作，伟大的毛泽东思想把他们培养成了优秀的共产党员。这就给了中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光！
    告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫！你玩弄的什么“要通俗一点”的西洋镜，一戳就破。谁都知道，根本不是什么“通俗”不“通俗”的问题。你是在拚命反对我们广大党员学习毛主席著作。为了实现你的阴谋，什么谎言你都能讲得出口，真是无耻之极！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫拚命反对把毛主席的话写进党员课本，抵制党员学习毛主席著作，目的是要把他的一套修正主义货色往党员头脑里塞。把黑《修养》当作党员教材，就会使党员变成私字当头，争名夺利，损人利己，贪生怕死的庸人；使党变成修正主义党、法西斯党，变成中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的工具。其用心是多么恶毒呀！
    我们必须把毛主席著作作为教育党员的基本教材。几年来我们遵照林副主席指示，在党员和干部战士中深入开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，努力做到手不离毛主席的书，嘴不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席的教导，把读毛主席的书作为生活中的第一需要。正是因为这样做了，所以许多党支部成为高举毛泽东思想红旗的坚强的战斗堡垒，广大党员和革命群众不断提高了阶级觉悟，努力改造世界观。许多老干部多年如一日，为革命兢兢业业，忠心耿耿，任劳任怨，不计报酬，甘当一辈子革命的“牛”；超期服役的老战士为革命勤勤恳恳，埋头苦干，成为骨干力量；大量的新战士，在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长。在两个阶级、两条路线的搏斗中，许多党员和非党同志成为学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。
    事实证明，只有用毛泽东思想教育党员，武装党员头脑，才能使党员真正成为毛主席所教导的那样
  “英勇作战的模范，执行命令的模范，遵守纪律的模范，政治工作的模范和内部团结统一的模范”，成为无产阶级先进分子。中国赫鲁晓夫越是拚命反对我们学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，我们越要加倍努力地学习毛主席著作。我们一定要以林副主席为榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
