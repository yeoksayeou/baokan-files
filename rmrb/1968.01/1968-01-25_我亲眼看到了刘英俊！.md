On July 22nd of last year, a mass rally to "Criticize the Top Capitalist-Roader Within the Party" was held at the Municipal People's Committee Square in Yingkou City. Revolutionary masses from all fronts, holding high red flags and red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," streamed towards the square from all directions.

At that time, At New Learning, a Five Good Soldier from a certain unit of the Yingkou garrison, was driving a horse-drawn cart back to the barracks. Along the way, he saw the revolutionary masses and Red Guards brimming with spirit and fighting spirit, and he felt extremely happy and excited. When the cart was about three hundred meters away from the venue, the loudspeakers at the venue suddenly blared, and combined with the honking of buses, the horse was startled, dragging the empty cart through the crowded street. It seemed that an accident was about to happen, and the personal safety of the revolutionary masses and Red Guards was seriously threatened.

The safety of the people is the safety of the soldier. To protect the revolutionary masses and Red Guards, At New Learning, with a heart full of love for the revolutionary masses and Red Guards, pulled the brake hard. Due to the brake failure, the horse continued to rush forward. Suddenly, he saw a fork in the road ahead, and in a moment of inspiration, he used all his strength to pull the reins hard, finally making the horse turn into a side road filled with half a foot of muddy water.

The startled horse dragged the empty cart through the muddy water. At New Learning's clothes were soaked with muddy water, his shoes fell off, and his hands were almost numb from the reins.... Suddenly, a group of Red Guards appeared ahead. At New Learning pulled the reins of the horse with all his might, and the horse, neighing, jumped up, its hind legs stepping on At New Learning's bare foot. He endured the pain, leaped up, and grabbed the horse's mane. He thought: Even if I die, I must pull the horse down and absolutely cannot let the horse rush into the group of Red Guards. The revolutionary masses and Red Guards on the street, while helping to stop the horse and block the cart, shouted loudly: "Let go! Let go!" At New Learning thought: At this critical moment, to save my own life and let go, is to be unfaithful to the revolutionary masses and unloyal to Chairman Mao. I am a soldier educated by Chairman Mao, and even if I sacrifice myself, I cannot let go! He shouted loudly: "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!" while struggling to pull the reins and the horse's mane, finally forcing the startled horse to avoid the crowd and turn into a second side road.

Ahead was the market, with many people coming and going. At this time, At New Learning, who had just recovered from a cold, had been dragged by the startled horse for more than a hundred meters and was already exhausted. His old illness of "intercostal neuralgia" suddenly flared up, and every step he took brought great pain. "No matter how difficult and dangerous the circumstances, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's warm teachings inspired At New Learning. He endured the pain and used all his strength to force the startled horse to turn into a third side road.

Just as the startled horse turned into this alley, less than seven meters ahead, there were two old women and several children walking. At this critical moment, a red sun rose in At New Learning's heart, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai"; the great images of heroes like Liu Yingjun stood before his eyes. Chairman Mao's teachings, the images of heroes, gave At New Learning's arms the strength of a thousand pounds. He grabbed the reins tightly with both hands, leaned his right shoulder against the cart shaft, and with all his might, pulled hard, making the cart turn sharply. The startled horse fell to the side of the road. At New Learning also fell onto the horse's back. At this moment, the surrounding revolutionary masses and Red Guards rushed over, and countless respectful and caring gazes fell upon At New Learning. The revolutionary masses, with admiration in their hearts, sent At New Learning and the cart and horse back to the barracks. An aunt excitedly told the comrades in the army: "This time, I saw Liu Yingjun with my own eyes!"

    “我亲眼看到了刘英俊！”
    去年七月二十二日，营口市广大革命群众在市人委广场召开“批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大会”。各条战线上的广大革命群众，高举红旗，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，从四面八方涌向广场。
    这时，营口驻军某部五好战士于新学正赶着马车回营房。一路上，他看到广大革命群众和红卫兵小将精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，感到无比高兴和激动。当大车走到离会场还有三百多米远的时候，会场上的大高音喇叭突然响了起来，加上公共汽车的鸣笛声，使这匹烈马受了惊，拖着空车在满是行人的马路上飞跑。眼看一场车祸就要发生，革命群众和红卫兵小将的人身安全受着严重威胁。
    人民群众的生命安全就是解放军战士的安全。为了保护革命群众和红卫兵小将的安全，于新学怀着一颗对无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将无限热爱的红心，猛扳刹车。由于刹车失灵，烈马继续向前猛冲。忽见前面有条岔路，他急中生智，用尽全身力气，猛拉缰绳，终于使烈马拐入了路边积有半尺多深泥水的岔道。
    惊马在泥水道上拖着空车飞跑。于新学的衣服被泥水溅湿透了，鞋子掉了，双手被缰绳勒得几乎失去了知觉……。突然，前面又出现了一队红卫兵小将。于新学双手猛力一勒马的缰绳，烈马被勒得嘶叫着往上一窜，后蹄正好踩在于新学光着的脚上。他忍着巨痛，纵身一跃抓住马鬃。他想：就是我死了，也一定要把马拉倒，绝不能让烈马冲入红卫兵小将的队伍。马路上的革命群众和红卫兵小将，一边帮助拦马挡车，一边大声疾呼：“快撒手！快撒手！”于新学想：在这紧急关头为了保住自己的生命而撒手，就是对革命群众的不爱，就是对毛主席的不忠。我是毛主席教导出来的人民子弟兵，就是自己牺牲了也不能撒手！他一面高喊着：快闪开！快闪开！一面拚力勒马的缰绳和马鬃，终于迫使惊马避开群众队伍，拐入了第二个岔道。
    前面就是菜市场，来来往往的人很多。这时，感冒刚好了的于新学，被惊马拖了一百多米，早已精疲力竭了，“筋间神经痛”的旧病又突然发作起来，每迈出一步，都要带来很大的痛苦。“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的亲切教导鼓舞着于新学，他忍着剧痛，用尽平生之力，迫使惊马拐进第三个岔道。
    惊马刚拐入这条小巷，在前面不到七米的地方，有两个老太太和几个小孩在行走。在这千钧一发之际，一轮红日从于新学心头升起，“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”；刘英俊等英雄人物的高大形象矗立在他的眼前。毛主席的教导，英雄的形象，给于新学的两臂平地加上了千钧之力。他双手紧抓马缰绳，右肩紧靠车辕，用尽力气，猛力一抗，车拐了个急弯，惊马摔倒在道旁。于新学也随着跌倒在马背上。这时，周围的革命群众和红卫兵小将一齐拥了上来，无数双崇敬、关怀的目光投到于新学同志身上。革命群众怀着敬佩的心情，把于新学和车、马送到营房。一位大嫂激动地向部队的同志说：“这回，我亲眼看到了刘英俊！”　本报通讯员
