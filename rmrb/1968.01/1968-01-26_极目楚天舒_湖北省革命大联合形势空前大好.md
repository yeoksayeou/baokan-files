The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and achieving a revolutionary great alliance, like the red sun shining over the mountains and rivers and the spring thunder roaring over the land, guide the broad revolutionary masses of Hubei Province to break away from "selfishness" and establish "publicness," overthrow factionalism, and actively join the surging tide of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

From the heroic city of Wuhan to the new industrial city of Huangshi, from the old revolutionary base area of the Dabie Mountains to the grain and cotton-producing Jianghan Plain, news of achieving revolutionary great alliance and establishing revolutionary committees is coming in one after another. Various fronts are solidly implementing revolutionary great alliance from the bottom up, combining the upper and lower levels, and achieving it by system, by industry, and by class.

We Have a Thousand and One Reasons to Unite

In the process of achieving revolutionary great alliance, a common experience of various revolutionary mass organizations is: "Only by acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we advance to victory." The Wuhan Meat Processing Plant is an example.

The Wuhan Meat Processing Plant has two relatively large revolutionary mass organizations—the Workers' Combat Team and the Red Flag Combat Team. They fought their way out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line together and forged a deep combat friendship. However, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism split them apart, and they argued endlessly. One said: "My organization is large, with many people, so I should be the 'core';" the other said: "I have more cadres, stronger revolutionary spirit, and without us, there can be no alliance." They fought fiercely for the "core," and every time they talked about alliance, it ended in failure.

Just at this time, the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao came: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." This great voice called them back from the path of error. With the help of the PLA comrades stationed in the factory, they entered the Mao Zedong Thought study class together. The leaders of the two organizations studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously and repeatedly, discussing as they learned. They recalled together the bitter experiences of being oppressed and exploited by landlords and capitalists in the old society, the happy life after liberation, and the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. The more they studied and recalled, the clearer their minds became, and the brighter their eyes shone. They said: Our struggle goals are the same, we have a thousand and one reasons to unite, and not a single reason to split. The leaders talked more and more, feeling that they must overcome factionalism. The leader of the Workers' Combat Team, Tan Guangqian, could no longer suppress his inner excitement. He walked up to the leader of the Red Flag Combat Team, Chen Yonghe, and said, "A thousand times wrong, ten thousand times wrong, the most wrong is to treat class brothers as enemies!" Chen Yonghe was at a loss for words, stretching out his powerful arms to tightly embrace Tan Guangqian. The two of them cried with emotion.

At this moment, the more than thirty students and PLA soldiers and officers gathered around them were also moved to tears, repeatedly shouting:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"
"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"
"Long live the revolutionary great alliance!"

Then, the students of the two major factions exchanged badges, commemorating this unforgettable moment. The entire factory immediately boiled over. Red flags fluttered, drums beat, and groups of people surged towards the study class, cheering and congratulating them. Overnight, the factory's mutual attack slogans disappeared, and everywhere was filled with the atmosphere of revolutionary great alliance. They finally joined hands again and advanced to victory on the road indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao!

The Masses Are the Real Heroes

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The important sign of a favorable situation is that the people have been thoroughly aroused. Never before has a mass movement been so extensive and profound as this one." The situation of revolutionary great alliance in Hubei is just like this.

Let us take a look at an ordinary factory in Hubei to see the moving scene of the broad revolutionary masses of Hubei striving to be promoters of revolutionary great alliance!

Last August, the revolutionary rebels of the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory split into three organizations: one called the "June 12 Corps," another called the "June 13 Corps," and another called the "September 13 Brigade." The three organizations each did their own thing, none of them yielding to the others, and they blamed each other for factionalism. Although the leaders of the three organizations had discussed alliance many times, they always got stuck on the "three names": rank, quota, and reputation.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions calling on revolutionary mass organizations in various places to achieve revolutionary great alliance blew like a strong east wind, awakening people's minds.

"What if the leaders don't unite? What do we do?"

Under the bright light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary masses of the entire factory unanimously raised this question.

The workers of the "June 12" and "June 13" factions in the Special Equipment Section said: "The leaders are stuck in arguments, we should unite and work together!" "The working class must be the master of the revolutionary great alliance and execute Chairman Mao's instructions without delay!" They each put away their organization's armbands and flags and first united. For the activities arranged by the two brigades, they participated if they were in line with Chairman Mao's teachings and the direction of the struggle; otherwise, they did not participate. At the same time, they actively prepared for the revolutionary workers' congress of their section.

The revolutionary actions of the workers in the Special Equipment Section shook the entire factory. Various workshops and departments hurriedly prepared for the revolutionary workers' congress of their units. On this basis, representatives elected by the revolutionary masses of various units connected and prepared for the revolutionary workers' congress of the entire factory.

The masses listened to Chairman Mao's words and united. The leaders of the three organizations finally woke up. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades should not assume that things they do not yet understand, the masses also do not understand at all. Many times, the broad masses run ahead of us, urgently needing to advance a step, and our comrades cannot be the leaders of the broad masses." The leaders of the three organizations studied this teaching of Chairman Mao over and over again, feeling that in the past, they were blinded by the "self" character, deviating from the track of Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, they also deviated from the masses and could not be the leaders of the broad masses. They said, a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes, all wrong because of the "self" character. The first secretaries of the three organizations first exposed and fought against their "self" character in small groups with small group representatives; then, they exposed and fought against their "self" character in the meeting of all representatives; finally, they exposed and fought against their "self" character in the meeting of all employees of the factory. The deeper the "self" character was fought, the more solidly Chairman Mao's latest instructions were implemented. On the day the entire factory achieved great unity, the first secretaries of the three organizations each sealed their organization's flags and seals with red paper and handed them over to the workers' congress in front of all the employees of the factory. At this moment, the entire factory erupted in cheers: Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary masses of the grassroots units on various fronts in Hubei, like the revolutionary masses of the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," took various revolutionary measures to quickly achieve revolutionary great alliance in their factories, mines, enterprises, communes, schools, institutions, and neighborhoods.

A Great Battle to Smash Factionalism

In the process of achieving revolutionary great alliance, the broad revolutionary masses of Hubei deeply felt: revolutionary great alliance is a fierce struggle between the proletarian "public" character and the bourgeois "self" character, a fierce struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

At the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill under the Guishan Mountain, three revolutionary mass organizations, due to the mischief of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, fought for the "core" and quotas, ignoring the capitalist roaders, and fought an "internal war" for more than a hundred days. A small organization's masses, in a fit of anger, left the factory.

With the help of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory, the leader of the large organization, Wang Ping, held Chairman Mao's book, thinking about what had happened in the factory, and her mind was in turmoil. She thought: Chairman Mao calls on us revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary great alliance, what reason do we have to split into two irreconcilable factions? Chairman Mao wants us not to self-proclaim as the core, the core is recognized by the masses in the practice of struggle, why do we always argue about the core and quotas? Chairman Mao teaches us to speak less about others' shortcomings and errors, and to do more self-criticism, why do we always specially look for the shortcomings and errors of other organizations? This series of "whys" made Wang Ping's mind clear, and she felt more and more that she had not listened to Chairman Mao's words and had not been loyal to Chairman Mao. She could no longer suppress her inner excitement and immediately proposed to everyone that they must bring back the comrades who left the factory and discuss the issue of achieving revolutionary great alliance together.

The factory's two organizations actively went to invite the masses of the small organization to return to the factory, which deeply moved the masses of the small organization.

On the very next day after the masses of the small organization returned to the factory, the leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations sat down together to study again. Everyone held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," turning to the same page. Chairman Mao said: "Those who cause this kind of independence often cannot separate from their personal first-ism." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, Wang Ping could not sit still. In the past, she always thought: "Our organization suffered the deepest persecution, fought the most resolutely, and had the greatest merits, so the great alliance should be centered on me, which is only natural." Chairman Mao's teachings made her sober up, and the more she studied, the more she felt that her factionalism was strong, her selfishness was heavy, and she had deviated from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. She took the lead in criticizing her factionalism in the study meeting, sincerely apologizing to the leader of the small organization in the factory, Wang Mingsheng: "In the past, I carried the burden of the large organization, thinking that our organization was a 'steel' block, wanting to 'eat' your small organization, claiming to be united but actually annexing. In the end, it was still the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism at work. A thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes, the biggest mistake is to go against Chairman Mao's teachings." Another organization leader, Ning Taojin, also criticized factionalism. The leader of the small organization, Wang Mingsheng, also made a soul-stirring self-criticism. He said: "In the past, we only talked about the large organization having factionalism, but in fact, our organization, though small, also had factionalism. We always thought that the organization was small but capable, and without our participation, your organization, no matter how large, could not achieve revolutionary great alliance. Not a thousand mistakes, not ten thousand mistakes, only the 'self' character in the mind was at work."

Chairman Mao's great teachings greatly raised their ideological awareness. Based on listening to the opinions of the masses, when they studied the plan for revolutionary great alliance again, they showed mutual humility, and the problems were solved smoothly. The entire factory quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance and established a revolutionary committee.

This factory's process of achieving revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination is a microcosm of the revolutionary masses of Hubei smashing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. In Yichang, Xiangyang, Enshi, Huanggang, Dongfeng, Jingzhou, and throughout the province, a revolutionary storm to smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has been unleashed, and the tide of revolutionary great alliance is surging forward irresistibly. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals throughout the province are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    极目楚天舒
    ——湖北省革命大联合形势空前大好
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”和实现革命大联合的最新指示，有如红日照山川，春雷动大地，引导湖北省广大革命群众破“私”立“公”，打倒派性，积极投入革命大联合和革命三结合的滚滚洪流之中。
    从英雄的江城——武汉，到新兴的工业城市——黄石，从革命老根据地大别山区，到盛产粮棉的江汉平原，实现革命大联合和成立革命委员会的喜讯一个接一个传来。各条战线正在扎扎实实地自下而上，上下结合，按系统、按行业、按班级实现革命大联合。
          我们有千万条理由联合
    在革命大联合中，各革命群众组织的一个共同的体会是：“只有按照毛主席最新指示办事，才能胜利前进。”武汉肉类联合加工厂就是一个例子。
    武汉肉类联合加工厂有两个较大的革命群众组织——工人战斗队和红旗战斗队。他们一同从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中杀了出来，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。可是，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性把他们分裂开来，一直争吵不休。一个说：我的组织大，人数多，要以我为“核心”；另一个说：我的骨干多，造反精神强，离了我们就联合不起来。他们拚命争“核心”，连谈了几次联合，总是一谈就“崩”。
    正在这时候，传来了伟大领袖毛主席的声音：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这伟大的声音，把他们从迷途中召唤回来了。在驻厂解放军同志的帮助下，他们共同走进了毛泽东思想学习班。两个组织的头头都认真地、反复地学习毛主席的最新指示，边学边议。他们共同回忆了在旧社会受地主、资本家压榨剥削的苦难经历，回忆了解放后的幸福生活，回忆了一年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争历程。他们越学习，越回忆，心越明，眼越亮。他们说：我们的斗争目标是共同的，我们有千万条理由联合，没有一点理由闹分裂。头头们越谈越觉得必须把派性打倒。工人战斗队负责人谭光前再也抑制不住内心的激动，走到红旗战斗队负责人陈永和跟前，说：“千不该，万不该，最不该把阶级兄弟当仇人！”陈永和一时答不上话来，伸出有力的双臂，紧紧抱住谭光前，两人激动得哭了起来。
    这时，聚集在他俩周围的三十多个学员和驻厂解放军指战员也都感动得满含热泪，连连高呼：
      “毛主席万岁！”
      “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    “革命的大联合万岁！”
    接着，两大派组织的学员们互相交换纪念章，纪念这个难忘的时刻。　全厂立刻沸腾起来了。红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，一队一队的人群，涌向学习班，向他们欢呼，祝贺。一夜之间，全厂互相攻击的标语不见了，到处都洋溢着革命大联合的气氛。他们终于重新携起手来，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的道路胜利前进！
  群众是真正的英雄
    毛主席教导我们：“形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”湖北地区革命大联合的形势正是这样。
    让我们从一个普通的工厂，来看一看湖北广大革命群众争当革命大联合的促进派的动人情景吧！
    去年八月，武汉汽车配件厂的革命造反派分裂成为三个组织：一个叫“六一二”兵团，另一个叫“六一三”兵团，还有一个叫“九一三”纵队。三个组织各搞各的一套，谁也不服谁，互相指责对方是派性的产物。尽管三个组织的头头也在一起多次商谈过联合，但每次都为“三名”：名次、名额、名誉问题，纠缠不清。
    毛主席号召各地革命群众组织实现革命大联合的最新指示，象强劲的东风，吹醒了人们的头脑。
    “头头不联合，我们怎么办？”
    全厂革命群众在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，都不约而同地提出了这个问题。
    专用设备工段的“六一二”和“六一三”两派的工人说：“头头光纠缠，我们合起来干！”“工人阶级要做革命大联合的主人，执行毛主席的指示一刻也不能等！”他们各自把自己组织的袖章、旗号收藏起来，首先联合了。对于两个兵团布置的活动，凡是符合毛主席教导的，符合斗争大方向的，他们参加；否则，都不参加。同时，他们积极筹备本工段的革命工代会。
    专用设备工段工人的革命行动，震动了全厂。各车间、科室纷纷筹备本单位的工代会。在这个基础上，由各单位革命群众推派代表，串连筹备全厂的革命工代会。
    群众听毛主席的话，联合起来了，三个组织的头头才猛醒过来。毛主席说：“我们的同志不要以为自己还不了解的东西，群众也一概不了解。许多时候，广大群众跑到我们的前头去了，迫切地需要前进一步了，我们的同志不能做广大群众的领导者”。三个组织的头头，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席这一教导，都感到过去被“私”字迷了心窍，离开了毛泽东思想的轨道。这样，也就脱离了群众，就不能做广大群众的领导者。他们说，千错万错，就错在一个“私”字上。三个组织的负责人首先在小组里同小组代表一起亮私、斗私；然后，在全体代表会上亮私、斗私；最后又在全厂职工大会上亮私、斗私。“私”字斗得深，毛主席最新指示就落实得牢。在全厂实现大联合那天，这三个组织的第一号勤务员各自把本组织的旗帜、公章用红纸封好，当着全厂职工的面，交给了工代会。这时，全厂一片欢呼：毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席革命路线万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    湖北地区各条战线基层单位的革命群众，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，就象武汉汽车配件厂的革命群众那样，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，采取多种多样的革命措施，促进本厂矿、本企业、本公社、本学校、本机关、本街道迅速实现革命大联合。
          一场大破派性的斗争
    湖北省广大革命群众在实现革命大联合的实践过程中深刻地体会到：革命的大联合是一场无产阶级的“公”字与资产阶级的“私”字的激烈斗争，是一场无产阶级党性与资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的激烈斗争。
    在龟山脚下的武汉国棉一厂，三个革命群众组织，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，为争“核心”、争名额，把走资派放在一边不管，整整打了一百多天“内战”。有个小组织的群众一气之下，离开了工厂。
    在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大组织的负责人王屏，捧着毛主席的书，想着厂里发生的事，脑子里直打架。她想：毛主席号召我们革命群众组织要实现革命大联合，我们有什么理由要分裂成为势不两立的两大派呢？毛主席要我们不要自封为核心，核心是在斗争实践中由群众公认的，我们为什么老在核心、名额等问题上争来争去呢？毛主席教导我们少讲别人的缺点、错误，多作自我批评，我们又为什么偏偏要专门找别的组织的缺点、错误呢？这一连串的“为什么”使王屏心里开了窍，越来越觉得自己没有听毛主席的话，没有忠于毛主席。她再也抑制不住内心的激动，立即向大家提出，一定要把离厂的同志接回来，共同商量实现革命大联合的问题。
    厂里两个组织主动去请小组织的群众回厂，使小组织的群众很受感动。
    就在小组织群众回厂的第二天，三个革命群众组织负责人，重新坐到一起学习。大家捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，翻在同一页上。毛主席说：“闹这类独立性的人，常常跟他们的个人第一主义分不开”。对照毛主席的教导，王屏坐立不安。过去，她总觉得：“我们的组织受的迫害最深，斗争最坚决，功劳最大，因此，大联合以我为核心，是理所当然的。”毛主席的教导，使她清醒过来，她越学越觉得自己的派性大，私心重，违背了毛主席的伟大战略部署。她在学习会上带头向自己的派性开火，沉痛地向厂里小组织的负责人王明生作了诚恳的检查：“我过去背上大组织包袱，认为我们这个组织是一块‘钢’，就是想要‘吃’掉你们小组织，名义上是联合，实际上是吞并。说来说去还是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在作怪。千错万错，违背毛主席的教导是最大的错。”另一个组织负责人宁桃珍也对派性进行了控诉。小组织的负责人王明生也作了触及灵魂的检查。他说：“过去，我们只讲大组织有派性，其实，我们组织虽小，派性也不小。老认为组织小，能力大，没有我们参加，你们组织再大也实现不了革命大联合。千不怪，万不怪，只怪头脑里的‘私’字在作怪。”
    毛主席的伟大教导，使他们的思想觉悟大大提高。在听取群众意见的基础上，他们再一次研究革命大联合的方案时，就出现了互相谦让的现象，问题迎刃而解。全厂很快实现了革命大联合，成立了革命委员会。
    这个工厂实现革命大联合和革命三结合的过程，是湖北地区革命群众打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的一个缩影。在宜昌，在襄阳，在恩施，在黄冈，在东风，在荆州，在全省都掀起了打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的革命风暴，革命大联合的潮流正在势不可挡地向前涌进。全省广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，正在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
