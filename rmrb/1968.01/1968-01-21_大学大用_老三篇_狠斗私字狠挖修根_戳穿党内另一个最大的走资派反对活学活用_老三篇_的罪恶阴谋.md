The revolutionary people love "The Three Articles" the most, while the class enemies hate "The Three Articles" the most. The thought of Mao Zedong possesses an immense power. Equipping the broad masses of the people with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and achieving the victory of the socialist and communist cause. Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructs us: "'The Three Articles' are not only for soldiers to study but also for cadres to study. 'The Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study 'The Three Articles' as a motto. Every level should study them. After studying, we must apply them and promote the revolutionization of thinking." All cadres and soldiers of the entire army and the revolutionary people of the whole country, in accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, have everyone study "The Three Articles," constantly compare and practice, greatly accelerating the revolutionization of thinking.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, facing the tens of millions of people extensively studying and applying "The Three Articles," breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, eliminating bourgeois elements and promoting proletarian elements in the movement of revolutionizing thinking, are trembling all over and terrified out of their wits. They are screaming and frantically destroying the revolutionary people's active study and application of "The Three Articles." The Chinese Khrushchev viciously denounces this as "dogmatism," "formalism," "simplification," and "vulgarization." Another major capitalist-roader within the party, besides parroting the clichés of the Chinese Khrushchev, also puts on a show of being a teacher, falsely claiming: "The four articles (referring to 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' 'Serve the People,' 'Quitting the Mountain,' and 'Opposing Liberalism') can be studied, but if they are studied year after year, the effect is not great," "It is not feasible to do this all year round." He himself finds it monotonous to slander and curse in this way, and colludes with his gang of fox and dog reactionaries such as the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, the counter-revolutionary two-faced Ertao, and the military usurper and anti-party big ambitionist Luo Ruiqing, singing in unison and frantically opposing the active study and application of "The Three Articles."

The great thought of Mao Zedong is the lifeline of the revolutionary people, the works of Chairman Mao are the treasure books of the revolutionary people, and the brilliant "The Three Articles" are the lifelong motto of every revolutionary. From my personal experience of studying the works of Chairman Mao, I deeply feel that "The Three Articles" are the most powerful weapon for transforming one's worldview, the most able to connect with one's own thoughts, the most able to solve practical problems, and the most able to inspire our limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. "The Three Articles" are the "introductory course" for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to actively study and apply the works of Chairman Mao, and they are also a compulsory course that we can never finish studying in our lifetime. We combine them with actual conditions, bringing the problems encountered in revolutionary struggles in each period to study, and we can always find answers, be inspired, raise our consciousness, and gain strength. The more we study, the more we enjoy it, and the more we apply, the more effective it is.

Another major capitalist-roader within the party slanders the revolutionary people's active study and application of "The Three Articles," opposing the revolutionary people's extensive study and application of "The Three Articles," which is opposing the revolutionary people using the brilliant thoughts of "The Three Articles" to resolutely struggle against "self," transform the non-proletarian worldview, and dig out the roots of revisionism; it is to let bourgeois ideology poison our souls, corrupt our revolutionary will, so as to facilitate their dream of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible!

The revolutionary people's extensive study of "The Three Articles" is the greatest obstacle to the class enemies' restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no love or hatred without reason in the world." The revolutionary people love to read "The Three Articles" the most, and the class enemies hate "The Three Articles" the most. The fundamental reason is that the proletariat wants to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"The Three Articles" are the powerful ideological weapons of the proletariat for seizing and consolidating power. We were able to achieve liberation and emancipation because we promoted the thorough revolutionary spirit of "The Three Articles." It is precisely under the wise leadership and education of our great leader Chairman Mao that countless revolutionary forerunners like Zhang Zide, who completely and thoroughly serve the people, fought to the death, and countless revolutionary fighters like Norman Bethune worked selflessly. The people of the whole country promoted the revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains," overthrew the three big mountains that oppressed the Chinese people, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and realized the socialist system.

Another major capitalist-roader within the party, during the period of the democratic revolution, was the accomplice of the Chinese Khrushchev in opposing the proletariat's seizure of power. After the liberation of the whole country, he became the second-in-command representative of the capitalist restoration forces within the party. He extremely hates the socialist system, viciously attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and fervently advocating "individual farming," "three selfs and one package," and so on. The revolutionary people's active study and application of the works of Chairman Mao, especially the extensive study and application of "The Three Articles," greatly promoted the spirit of communism, which for public good, has become the greatest obstacle to their restoration of capitalism. Therefore, it inevitably provoked their frantic curses and desperate opposition.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we not only need the correct line and policy, but also need to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution." Actively studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao, extensively studying "The Three Articles," is the fundamental way to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The good soldiers of Chairman Mao that have emerged in our army, such as Lei Feng, Ou Yang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, Mai Xiande, and Nian Siwang, are a new generation of people cultivated by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The people of the whole country actively study and apply the works of Chairman Mao, extensively study "The Three Articles," and can ensure that our country forever advances along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao, preventing the restoration of capitalism.

Another major capitalist-roader within the party advocates "organizing youth to read books in various ways," to all "become literate people, cultured people, people who can master science and technology," which is to prevent us from actively studying and applying "The Three Articles," to be "a noble person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has broken away from low-level interests, a person who is beneficial to the people." The practice of class struggle tells us: "literate people," "cultured people," "people who master science and technology" are divided into classes. Science and technology can serve the proletariat, and can also serve the bourgeoisie, the problem lies in whose hands they are in. Chairman Mao teaches us: politics is the commander, is the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without the correct political viewpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul." If, as another major capitalist-roader within the party says, we do not extensively study "The Three Articles," do not resolutely transform our worldview, and only "be literate," "be cultured," "master science and technology," then what is the difference between the successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and the inheritors of the bourgeois legacy? The young masters and misses of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionary ruling classes, are they not "literate," "cultured," or do they not master certain "science and technology"? From this, we can clearly see that another major capitalist-roader within the party is willing to be a running dog of imperialism and a slave of the bourgeoisie; in destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, they play a role that imperialism and the bourgeoisie cannot play.

At the crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," which is a new mobilization order for thoroughly criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and is the fundamental policy for achieving the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must definitely follow the great instructions of Chairman Mao, resolutely struggle against "self," and dig out the roots of revisionism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Another major capitalist-roader within the party's frantic opposition to the active study and application of "The Three Articles" also tells us from the opposite side the extreme importance of extensively studying "The Three Articles" and breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit. The more the enemy fears and opposes, the more we must extensively study and apply. We must resolutely struggle against "self," resolutely criticize revisionism, drive "self" out the door, let "public" settle in our minds, criticize revisionism deeply and thoroughly, and uproot it.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field is still a long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce struggle." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we not only need to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, remove their positions, seize their power, and seize their politics, but also need to seize their politics in the ideological field and uproot the ideological roots of revisionism. This is a longer-term, more arduous, and more complex struggle.

"Self" is the ideological root of revisionism. Whether it is the Chinese Khrushchev or another major capitalist-roader within the party, they are the same as the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, a group of representatives of the bourgeoisie who serve the overthrown exploiting classes at home and imperialism and reactionary classes abroad. They are the culminators of "self," the chief culprits of restoring capitalism. In order to restore capitalism, they must create public opinion that everyone is selfish and fiercely oppose public-spirited thoughts. The brilliant "The Three Articles" are our sharp weapons for struggling against "self," the highest standard for establishing public spirit, and an important treasure for struggling against "self" and criticizing revisionism. We insist on actively studying and applying "The Three Articles," resolutely struggling against "self" and criticizing revisionism, consciously exploding a revolution in the depths of our souls, fighting a "protracted war" strategically, fighting a "decisive battle" tactically, actively attacking, taking the initiative to strike, continuously revolutionizing, and relentlessly pursuing and attacking, we can completely annihilate "self" and make revisionism die out.

Marx and Engels pointed out more than a hundred years ago: "The communists can sum up their theory in one sentence: the abolition of private property." The highest ideal of communists is to realize communism throughout the country and the world. Chairman Mao said: "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a new social system." The core of the communist ideological system is the character "public," and the communist social system must be established by communists who are wholeheartedly for the public good. The great thought of Mao Zedong is the most complete communist ideological system. Actively studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao, extensively studying "The Three Articles," breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, is the fundamental way to develop communist ideology, and is the fundamental guarantee for establishing the communist social system.

The attitude towards Chairman Mao and the thought of Mao Zedong is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Three Articles" is also the same. All revolutionaries unconditionally love "The Three Articles," while all counter-revolutionaries instinctively oppose and sabotage the study of "The Three Articles." Another major capitalist-roader within the party slanders and attacks the revolutionary people's study of "The Three Articles" because he, like the Chinese Khrushchev, is an old counter-revolutionary disguised as an "old revolutionary." We must definitely wield the thousand-catty club of Mao Zedong thought, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and another major capitalist-roader within the party.

    大学大用“老三篇”　狠斗私字狠挖修根
    ——戳穿党内另一个最大的走资派反对活学活用“老三篇”的罪恶阴谋
    廖初江    
    革命人民最爱“老三篇”　阶级敌人最恨“老三篇”
    毛泽东思想具有无比巨大的威力。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，促进人的思想革命化，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，使社会主义和共产主义事业取得胜利的最可靠最根本的保证。我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席指示我们：“‘老三篇’不但战士要学，干部也要学。‘老三篇’最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。”我们全军干部战士和全国革命人民，按照林副主席的指示，人人学习老三篇，时时对照，事事照办，大大加速了思想革命化。
    党内最大的一小撮走资派，面对着亿万人民大学大用老三篇、破私立公、灭资兴无的思想革命化运动，吓得浑身发抖，魂飞魄散。他们一个个声嘶力竭地咒骂和疯狂破坏革命人民活学活用老三篇。中国赫鲁晓夫大骂这是“教条主义”，“形式主义”，“简单化”，“庸俗化”。党内另一个最大的走资派，除了重弹中国赫鲁晓夫的滥调外，还摆出一副教师爷的架势，胡说什么：“四篇文章（按：指《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》）可以学，但是如果年年都学那几篇，作用也不大”，“一年四季都这么搞不行”。他自己这样诬蔑咒骂犹嫌单调，还串通他们一伙狐群狗党如反革命修正主义分子彭真、反革命两面派陶铸、篡军反党的大野心家罗瑞卿等，一唱一和，疯狂反对活学活用老三篇。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是革命人民的命根子，毛主席的著作是革命人民的宝书，光辉的老三篇是我们每个革命者毕生的座右铭。我从自己学习毛主席著作的亲身经历中，深深体会到：老三篇是改造世界观的最强大的武器，最能和自己的思想挂钩，最能解决现实问题，也最能激发我们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的感情。老三篇是我们广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的“进门课”，也是我们一辈子学不完的必修课。我们结合实际，带着各个时期在革命斗争中遇到的问题来学，都能从中找到答案，受到启发，提高觉悟，获得力量。越学越有味道，越用越有效果。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，诬蔑革命人民活学活用老三篇，反对革命人民大学大用老三篇，就是反对革命人民用老三篇的光辉思想，狠斗“私”字，改造非无产阶级世界观，挖掉修正主义的根子；就是想让资产阶级思想毒害我们的灵魂，腐蚀我们的革命斗志，以便于实现他们颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的梦想。这，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    革命人民大学“老三篇”，是阶级敌人复辟资本主义的最大障碍
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”革命人民最爱读老三篇，阶级敌人最仇恨老三篇，根本原因就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。
    老三篇是无产阶级夺取政权巩固政权的强大思想武器。我们所以能够获得翻身解放，是同发扬老三篇的彻底革命精神分不开的。正是由于在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导和教育下，无数完全、彻底为人民服务的张思德式的革命先烈浴血奋战，无数白求恩式的革命战士忘我工作，全国人民发扬“愚公移山”的革命干劲，才推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，建立起无产阶级专政，实现了社会主义制度。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，在民主革命时期，就是中国赫鲁晓夫反对无产阶级夺取政权的帮凶。全国解放以后，他又是社会上资本主义复辟势力在党内的第二号总代表。他极端仇恨社会主义制度，恶毒地攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，狂热地鼓吹“单干”、“三自一包”，等等。革命人民活学活用毛主席著作，特别是大学大用老三篇，使一心为公的共产主义思想大大发扬，这就成为他们复辟资本主义的最大障碍。因此，必然地要引起他们疯狂的咒骂，拚死的反对。
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”活学活用毛主席著作，大学大用老三篇，是培养造就亿万无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径。我军出现的雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥、麦贤得、年四旺等毛主席的好战士，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想培育出来的一代新人。全国人民活学活用毛主席著作，大学大用老三篇，就能保证我们的国家永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道胜利前进，防止资本主义复辟。
    党内另一个最大的走资派鼓吹要“多方面组织青年读书”，都“成为识字的人，有文化的人，能够掌握科学和技术的人”，就是不准我们活学活用老三篇，做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”阶级斗争的实践告诉我们：“识字的人”，“有文化的人”，“掌握科学和技术的人”，是划分为阶级的。科学技术，可以为无产阶级服务，也可以为资产阶级服务，问题在于掌握在那一个阶级手中。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”如果象党内另一个最大的走资派说的那样，不大学大用老三篇，不狠狠改造世界观，只要“识字”、“有文化”、“掌握科学和技术”就好，那么无产阶级革命事业的接班人和资产阶级衣钵的继承者，还有什么区别？美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义以及一切反动统治阶级的少爷小姐，不都是“识字”、“有文化”，或者是掌握着一定的“科学和技术”吗？从这里，我们可以清楚地看出，党内另一个最大的走资派甘作帝国主义走狗和资产阶级的奴才；对于破坏无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，起着帝国主义和资产阶级所起不到的作用。
    在“斗私，批修”中狠学狠用“老三篇”，武装自己，埋葬敌人
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，这是彻底批判党内一小撮走资派的新的动员令，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本方针。我们一定要按照毛主席的伟大指示，坚决斗掉“私”字，挖掉修正主义的根子。
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”党内另一个最大的走资派，疯狂地反对活学活用老三篇，也从反面告诉我们大学大用老三篇，破私立公的极端重要性。敌人越是害怕，越是反对，我们就越要大学特学，大用特用。狠狠地斗私，狠狠地批修，把“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字在头脑里安家落户，把修正主义批深批透，连根拔掉。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，不但要打倒党内一小撮走资派，罢他们的官，夺他们的权，专他们的政，而且要在意识形态领域里专他们的政，挖掉修正主义的思想根子。这是一场更长期更艰巨更复杂的斗争。
    “私”字是产生修正主义的思想根子。中国的赫鲁晓夫也好，党内另一个最大的走资派也好，都和苏修叛徒集团一样，是一批在国内为被推翻的剥削阶级服务，在国际上为帝国主义和各国反动派服务的资产阶级代表人物。他们集“私”字之大成，是复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首。他们为了复辟资本主义，就要大造人人为私的舆论，大反特反为公的思想。光辉灿烂的老三篇，是我们斗私的锐利武器，立公的最高标准，是我们斗私批修的重要法宝。我们坚持活学活用老三篇，狠狠地斗私批修，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，在战略上打“持久战”，在战术上打“速决战”，积极进攻，主动出击，不断革命，穷追猛打，就能够全歼“私”字，使修正主义断子绝孙。
    马克思和恩格斯早在一百多年前就指出：“共产党人可以用一句话把自己的理论概括起来：消灭私有制。”我们共产党人的最高理想，就是要在全国和全世界实现共产主义。毛主席说：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。”共产主义思想体系的核心就是一个“公”字，共产主义的社会制度，必须由一心为公的共产主义新人来建立。伟大的毛泽东思想，是最完整的共产主义思想体系。活学活用毛主席著作，大学大用老三篇，破私立公，是发展共产主义思想的根本途径，是建立共产主义社会制度的根本保证。
    对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，是革命和反革命的分水岭。对待毛主席的光辉著作老三篇的态度也是这样。一切革命派都无限热爱老三篇，一切反革命派都本能地反对、破坏学习老三篇。党内另一个最大的走资派所以诬蔑、攻击革命人民学习老三篇，就是因为他同中国赫鲁晓夫一样是一个披着“老革命”外衣的老反革命。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派，批深批透，批倒批臭。
