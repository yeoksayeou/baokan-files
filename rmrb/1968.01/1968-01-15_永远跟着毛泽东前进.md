The red sun shines over the world, and the red hearts turn towards the sun.
Dear Chairman Mao, you are the greatest teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world, the most brilliant helmsman of the revolutionary ship, and the red sun in the hearts of the people of the whole world! Under your guidance, the ship of world revolution rides the winds and breaks the waves, advancing on the red route.

Sailors from the five continents sing your praises, and the people of the whole world extol you! Dear Chairman Mao, you are the great savior of humanity.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, even if the sea were ink and the earth were paper, it would not be enough to write down the boundless love of the people of the whole world for you.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of the world sincerely wish you eternal life!

Forever march forward with Mao Zedong
Mao Zedong is in our hearts

On a night at the harbor, the lights are shining brightly. A Japanese merchant ship is busy with its sealing work, preparing to set sail the next day.

After everything is ready, people gradually go to rest. At this time, a young sailor came to me, the border inspection officer, and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Then he asked me, the inspection officer, to read Mao's quotations to him. He said in broken Chinese, "Dear friend, I want to hear Chairman Mao's voice!" The inspection officer was moved by his boundless love for Chairman Mao and studied with him. It seemed that he did not know English and could not recognize many Chinese characters, but from his deeply focused expression, one could see how much he loved Chairman Mao and how much he believed in Mao Zedong Thought!

Before parting, this young sailor carefully took out a red cloth package from his inner pocket, with a shining Mao badge pinned on it, and inside was Mao's speech in 1964, "In Support of the Anti-U.S. Patriotic Struggle of the Japanese People." He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong understands the feelings of the Japanese people the most. His speech fully expresses the wishes of the Japanese people and the wishes of all oppressed peoples. Mao Zedong is in our hearts, and the Japanese people will forever march forward with Mao Zedong!"

My greatest wish has been fulfilled

One noon, I stood on the deck of a foreign ship, facing the sea breeze and reciting the "Three Articles." Perhaps because I was too focused, I didn't know when a transit friend from Somalia appeared beside me.

He said, "Dear Chinese friend, I am very eager to get a copy of Mao Zedong's 'Red Book.' I really want to learn how to shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' in Chinese. This is my greatest wish! I hope my greatest wish can be fulfilled. Mao Zedong has united seven hundred million Chinese people as one. Mao Zedong is truly great."

When his wish was fulfilled and he learned to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese, he walked and shouted joyfully, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life

The morning sun is red like fire, and the blue sea shines with golden light. The harbor is bathed in a sea of sunlight. At this time, accompanied by the bright song "The East is Red, the Sun Rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong," a foreign sailor walked down from the gangway.

"Chairman Mao is good! The soldiers of the Liberation Army are good!" After greeting enthusiastically, he handed a poem he had written beforehand to the inspection officer. The poem read: Mao Zedong, like the sun, gives people sunlight, gives people revolutionary thoughts. The sun is Chairman Mao, revolutionary thoughts are Mao Zedong Thought. The sun shines over the whole world, Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of the oppressed. Advance, towards the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. Fight, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight. Victory belongs to the great teacher Mao Zedong, belongs to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, belongs to the people of the whole world. Long live the great teacher Chairman Mao! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong!

On the road to the harbor from the sailors' club, a group of foreign sailors walked towards the harbor, their Mao badges shining brightly in the sunlight.

The inspection officer on duty at the port checked their landing permits, and the sailors went to work on the ship one by one. The last sailor, taking advantage of the moment when the inspection officer checked the landing permit, slipped a note into the inspection officer's hand and said softly, "Greetings to Mao Zedong!" Then he hurriedly stepped onto the deck via the gangway.

The inspection officer opened the note and read: "Dear comrade, please convey to the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong that the Soviet people have boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao, just as we cherish and respect Lenin. Mao Zedong, the hope of the Soviet people." The signature at the bottom read: "The successors of Lenin and Stalin."

The greatest happiness of the revolutionary people of the world

Many foreign sailors surrounded the inspection officer, Little Zhang, tightly, eagerly asking him for Mao's portrait.

At this time, an elderly woman from England was seen struggling to push her way into the crowd from the outskirts, but she was no match for those young people. After struggling for half a day, she was still on the outermost layer. This made the old lady very anxious, and she looked around and then rushed straight towards me.

"I love Mao Zedong the most and really want to see Mao Zedong. Please help me."

When she received the photo of our great leader Mao Zedong swimming in the Yangtze River and standing tall on the bow of the ship, she hurriedly took out her old glasses from the room and carefully examined Mao's portrait over and over again. Finally, she smiled and said, "No one in the world can compare with Mao Zedong. He is too great. Mao Zedong is so healthy. He is over seventy years old and can still swim in the Yangtze River. This is not only the greatest happiness for your Chinese people but also the greatest happiness for us English people and the people of the whole world. I will take this good news back and let my friends see Mao Zedong, let them know that Mao Zedong is very healthy."

Mao Zedong is the great helmsman

One day, an old foreign helmsman spoke deeply to us, "We sailors understand the importance of a helmsman the most. A good helmsman, on the vast ocean, no matter how great the danger, can remain calm and decisive, turning danger into safety, breaking through the waves and currents, avoiding reefs and shoals; at every critical moment, can correct the ship's course, ride the winds and break the waves, and march forward bravely! Mao Zedong is the teacher and leader of the people of the world, the best helmsman of the world revolutionary ship! The people of the world have such a good helmsman, the world revolution must be victorious!"

The old helmsman said this, looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and sang "The Ocean Voyage Depends on the Helmsman." At that time, we were deeply moved by the sincere feelings of this old helmsman's boundless love, admiration, and belief in Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we sang together, "The ocean voyage depends on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, dew and rain make the crops grow strong, to revolutionize, we depend on Mao Zedong Thought."

### 永远跟着毛泽东前进

专栏：

    红日照环宇，红心向太阳。
    敬爱的毛主席，您是全世界革命人民最伟大的导师，您是革命航船最英明的舵手，您是全世界人民心中的红太阳！世界革命的航船在您老人家的指引下，乘风破浪，前进在红色的航道上。
    五大洲海员歌唱您，全世界人民颂扬您！敬爱的毛主席，您是人类的大救星。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，用海水作墨，大地作纸，也写不尽全世界人民对您的无限热爱。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，世界革命人民最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
    永远跟着毛泽东前进
    毛泽东和我们心连心
    海港的夜晚，灯火辉煌。一艘日本商船正进行着繁忙的封舱工作，准备次日起航。
    一切就绪后，人们陆续休息了。这时只见一位青年船员来到我边防检查员身边，满怀激情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”然后就要求我检查员给他朗读毛主席语录。他用不熟练的中国话说：“亲爱的朋友，我要听毛主席的声音！”检查员被他无限热爱毛主席的感情所感动，便和他一起学习。看样子他不识英文，汉字也认识不了多少，但是从他那无限贯注的神情中，可以看出他对毛主席是多么热爱，对毛泽东思想是多么信仰啊！
    临别前，这位青年海员从内衣口袋里小心翼翼地掏出一个红布包，上边别着一枚金光夺目的毛主席像章，里边放着毛主席一九六四年发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》。他说：“毛泽东主席最了解我们日本人民的心情，他的谈话充分表达了我们日本人民的心愿，表达了一切被压迫人民的心愿。毛泽东和我们心连心，我们日本人民永远跟着毛泽东前进！”
    我最幸福的愿望实现了
    一天中午，我站在一艘外国轮船的甲板上，迎着海风背诵“老三篇”，可能由于精神过于集中，不晓得身边什么时间来了一位过境的索马里朋友。
    他开口道：“亲爱的中国朋友，我非常渴望得到一本毛泽东的‘红书’，我非常想学会用中国话喊‘毛主席万岁！’这是我最幸福的愿望！希望能满足我这最幸福的要求。毛泽东把七亿中国人民团结得象一个人一样，毛泽东实在太伟大了。”
    当他的愿望得到了满足，并学会用中国话欢呼“毛主席万岁！”后，他兴高采烈地边走边喊：“毛主席万岁！”
    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆
    朝阳红似火，碧海闪金光。海港的早晨沐浴在一片阳光之中。这时伴随着“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”的嘹亮歌声，从轮梯上走下来一个外国海员。
      “毛主席好！解放军同志好！”他热情地打过招呼后，把一首事先写好的诗歌递给了检查员。诗中写道：毛泽东，如同太阳，给人民以阳光，给人民以革命思想。太阳就是毛主席，革命思想就是毛泽东思想。太阳照耀全世界，毛泽东思想把被压迫的人心照亮。前进，朝着毛主席指出的方向前进。战斗，运用毛泽东思想战斗。胜利属于伟大的导师毛泽东，
    属于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，
    属于全世界人民。伟大的导师毛主席万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！向毛泽东主席问好！
    在海员俱乐部通向码头的大路上，一群外国海员兴高采烈地朝着码头走来，胸前的毛主席像章在阳光下闪闪发光。
    正在港口执勤的检查员看过他们的登陆证后，海员们陆续地登轮工作去了。走在最后的一位海员借着我执勤人员检查登陆证的一刹间，向我检查员手里塞了一个纸条，并低声说了一句：“向毛泽东问好！”然后匆忙踏着轮梯登上了甲板。
    我检查员打开纸条一看，上边写着：“亲爱的同志，请您转达敬爱的毛泽东主席，我们苏联人民对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬，就象怀念和崇敬列宁一样。毛泽东，苏联人民的希望。”下边的署名是：“列宁、斯大林的接班人”。
  世界革命人民的最大幸福
    很多外国海员把检查员小张围了个水泄不通，正在簇拥着向小张索取毛主席像。
    这时只见一位英格兰的老太太在人群外围拚命地往里挤，可是她那是那些青年人的“对手”，挤了半天还是在最外层。这可把老太太急坏了，他向四周望了望，便径直地朝我跑来。
    “我最敬爱毛泽东，非常想见毛泽东，请你帮我的忙。”
    当她得到我们伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江、巍然站立在船头的照片时，急忙从房间里取出老花镜，一遍又一遍地仔细端详着毛主席像，最后眉开眼笑地说：“世界上谁也不能和毛泽东相比，他太伟大了。毛泽东身体这样健康，他七十多岁了还能畅游长江，这不仅是你们中国人民的最大幸福，也是我们英格兰人民和全世界人民的最大幸福。我要把这个喜讯带回去，让我的朋友们都能看到毛泽东，让他们知道毛泽东身体非常健康。”
    毛主席是伟大舵手
    一天，一位外国老司舵深有感触地跟我们说：“我们航海人最了解舵手的重要。好的舵手，在茫茫的大海上航行，不管遇到多么大的风险，都能沉着冷静，当机立断，转危为安，能冲破激流恶浪，绕过暗礁浅滩；每在关键时刻，都能拨正船头，乘风破浪，勇往直前！毛泽东，是世界人民的导师和领袖，是世界革命航船最好最好的舵手！世界人民有这样好的舵手，世界革命一定能胜利！”
    老司舵说到这里，抬头仰望墙壁上的毛主席像，唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》。当时，我们被这位老司舵对毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限崇拜和无限信仰的真挚感情所深深感动，和他一起齐声高歌：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。”
