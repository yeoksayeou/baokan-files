Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee and the 69000 Troops held a symposium to summarize the experience of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The symposium emphasized the establishment of the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented in action.

Most regions in the province have achieved revolutionary great unity, and six districts and cities have established revolutionary preparatory committees.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 3rd: During the high tide of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Hunan Province, the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the 69000 Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a symposium to summarize and exchange experiences from various places in running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The symposium emphasized the establishment of the revolutionary good learning style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao. It stressed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented in every aspect, and that learning and application must be combined to achieve immediate results, ensuring the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Since the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," cities and countryside across Hunan have responded enthusiastically, launching a wave of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Provincial, municipal, district, and county levels, as well as revolutionary mass organizations, factories, schools, government agencies, shops, and neighborhoods, have all set up various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Preliminary statistics show that the province has established over 15,000 study classes, with more than 2 million people participating in the study.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the province have taken "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle. They have extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant works of the "Old Five Articles," greatly promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking and powerfully advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and various work and production tasks across the province. For example, before the widespread establishment of study classes, no county or city in the province had achieved revolutionary great unity. After studying in the classes, the revolutionary masses deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, promoting and consolidating revolutionary great unity. Now, most regions and counties, cities, and towns in the province have either achieved or are in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity. The widespread establishment of study classes has also greatly promoted revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Currently, six districts and cities in the province have established revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and many counties and cities are preparing to establish such groups.

At this symposium, representatives from the Changsha Qing Shuitang Neighborhood Mao Zedong Thought Study Class and advanced units from various places in the province that have run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, district and municipal-level officials responsible for running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, and representatives from the stationed Liberation Army exchanged experiences in running and successfully operating Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They also focused on discussing how to genuinely establish the revolutionary good learning style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao.

Representatives from the advanced units unanimously agreed that to establish a revolutionary good learning style and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it is necessary to guide the students to recognize that whether or not to resolutely execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

How do the study classes implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions? How to focus on the "application" aspect? The specific method is "three thinks and one decision," which means that when encountering a new thought or problem, one should think about Chairman Mao's great example, think about Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and think about whether one's own thoughts are correct. Then, one should make a decision and act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Although many problems are complex, once "three thinks and one decision" is applied, the students' minds become clear. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror to reflect on "selfishness," use Mao Zedong Thought as a ruler to measure right and wrong, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize errors, actively engaging in self-criticism. The study classes have become a lively battlefield for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and many previously difficult-to-solve problems have been relatively quickly resolved.

Another important experience shared at the symposium is that criticizing revisionism must involve fighting selfishness, and fighting selfishness must be linked with criticizing revisionism. By linking fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness for the purpose of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, one can truly hate and fight against "selfishness," raise the level of struggle, take the initiative to attack, hit the key points, and achieve the goal of fundamentally transforming one's worldview.

After fully exchanging successful experiences in running Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various aspects, the symposium discussed the plan and measures for further running and successfully operating Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the province.

    湖南省革筹小组和六九○○部队召开座谈会总结办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验
    树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风  学习毛主席最新指示落实到行动上
    全省多数地区实现了革命大联合，六个专区、市成立革筹小组
    据新华社长沙三日电　湖南省革命委员会筹备小组、中国人民解放军六九○○部队，在湖南省大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮中，召开座谈会，总结交流各地举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，强调切实建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，对毛主席的最新指示，要做到条条落实，句句照办，学用结合，立竿见影，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    自从伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大指示以后，湖南城乡各地闻风而动，掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。省、市、地、县各级和各革命群众组织、工厂、学校、机关、商店、街道，普遍办起了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班。据初步统计，全省已办学习班一万五千多个，参加学习班学习的人数共达二百多万人。
    全省各地的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大学大用毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”等光辉著作，大大促进了人的思想革命化，有力地推进了全省无产阶级文化大革命，推动了各项工作和生产。例如在大办学习班以前，全省还没有一个县、市实现革命大联合。经过学习班的学习，革命群众加深了对毛主席的伟大战略部署的理解，促进和巩固了革命大联合。现在，全省多数地区和大多数县、市、镇已经或初步实现了革命大联合。大办学习班，也大大地促进了革命三结合。目前全省已有六个专区、市成立了革命委员会筹备小组，许多县、市正在酝酿建立革筹小组。
    在这次座谈会上，长沙清水塘街道毛泽东思想学习班和全省各地举办毛泽东思想学习班先进单位的代表，地、市各级举办毛泽东思想学习班的负责人，各革命群众组织代表，驻地解放军代表等，交流了大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，并着重讨论了如何切实建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风的问题。
    各先进单位的代表一致认为，要建立革命的好学风，落实毛主席的最新指示，必须引导学员认识到：是不是坚决地执行毛主席的最新指示，是对毛主席、毛泽东思想的态度问题，是忠不忠于毛主席的问题。
    学习班如何落实毛主席的最新指示？怎样做到在“用”字上狠下功夫？具体办法是“三想一定”，就是出现一个活思想，遇到一个新问题，都想一想毛主席的伟大榜样，想一想毛主席的有关教导，想一想自己的想法对不对头，然后下定决心，按照毛主席的最新指示去做。尽管许多问题纷纭复杂，一进行“三想一定”，学员们心里就豁然开朗，纷纷以毛泽东思想为镜子，照出“私”字，以毛泽东思想作尺子，衡量是非，以毛泽东思想为武器，批判错误，自觉地开展自我批评。学习班成了一个生动活泼的“斗私，批修”的战场，许多原来难以解决的问题，都比较迅速地解决了。
    这次座谈会上交流的另一条重要经验是，批修必须斗私，斗私和批修必须联系起来。联系批修去斗私，为反修防修去斗私，对“私”字就恨得起，斗得狠，自觉上纲，主动进攻，切中要害，达到从根本上改造世界观的目的。
    座谈会在充分交流大办毛泽东思想学习班各个方面的成功经验后，讨论了在全省进一步大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的规划和措施。
