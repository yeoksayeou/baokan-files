The two revolutionary mass organizations of the Wuhan Meat Processing Plant jointly held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Initially, the participants had many active thoughts, and the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions were strong. Three discussions on unity were unsuccessful. However, with the help of the People's Liberation Army—

Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions to Achieve Revolutionary Great Unity Immediately

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The two revolutionary mass organizations of the Wuhan Meat Processing Plant seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the help of the stationed PLA soldiers, they jointly held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They established the principle of "loyalty," fought against selfishness, and emphasized the practical application of Mao's teachings. This significantly promoted the revolutionary great unity throughout the factory.

The distinctive feature of this factory's joint Mao Zedong Thought study class is that the entire factory, as well as each workshop, is jointly run by the two factions from top to bottom. Now, the factory has established revolutionary workers' congresses by workshop from the bottom up, achieving revolutionary great unity.

Their main experiences are as follows:

(1) Establishing unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for correcting the learning attitude, running the study class well, and promoting revolutionary great unity.

When the study class was first established, the participants had many active thoughts, and the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions were strong. They discussed unity three times, but because both sides kept exposing each other's weaknesses and attacking each other, all three attempts failed. To quickly unite the leaders of the two factions and the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, the study class, with the help and support of the PLA, guided everyone to discuss the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They discussed Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and saw Mao's epoch-making developments in Marxism-Leninism. The leaders of the two factions and the revolutionary masses became more excited and enthusiastic with each discussion, and their thoughts converged. Everyone united on the deep class feelings of unlimited love for Chairman Mao. At the same time, the two factions in the study class also jointly recalled the bitterness of the old society and compared it with the sweetness of the new society; they recalled the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and compared it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; they recalled the bitterness of the two factions' "internal war" and compared it with the sweetness of joint struggle. Through discussion, observation, recall, and comparison, the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions gradually disappeared. Each side examined their past failures to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and further established unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, the revolutionary great unity had a common ideological foundation.

(2) Fiercely fight against selfishness and transform one's worldview.

The study class consistently and firmly grasped the principle of "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and the weapon of self-criticism. In the study class, although the leaders of the two factions and the revolutionary masses gradually improved their understanding of achieving revolutionary great unity, they still had various concerns about exposing their selfishness in front of the other side and conducting self-criticism. They were afraid that the other side would seize on their weaknesses. With the help of the PLA soldiers, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and realized that in achieving great unity, daring to expose and fight against selfishness in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings and conducting more self-criticism is a fundamental attitude of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is the key to achieving ideological revolutionization. Everyone dispelled their concerns, voluntarily and fiercely fought against selfishness, transformed their thoughts, and achieved revolutionary great unity. Everyone deeply felt that with selfishness at the forefront, nothing makes sense; by casting aside the "I," everything becomes clear.

(3) Firmly grasp the application, and strive to establish a revolutionary learning style.

The two factions participating in the study class, with the help of the PLA soldiers, targeted the past tendencies of separating learning from application, inconsistency between words and deeds, and the detachment of theory from practice. They firmly grasped the application and established a revolutionary learning style that combines theory with practice. Everyone examined themselves seriously according to Chairman Mao's teachings and pointed out the problems in this aspect. They solemnly pointed out: learning Mao Zedong Thought and not applying it is disloyalty to Chairman Mao; not firmly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions is the biggest selfishness. In solving the problem of revolutionary great unity, they mainly grasped the application from three aspects: first, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, with words and deeds consistent. Expose selfishness thoroughly; fight against selfishness resolutely. Second, the leaders of the two factions and the revolutionary masses in the study class went deep into the workshops, vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses of various factions, extensively exposed the harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, extensively spoke about the benefits of revolutionary great unity, extensively broke away from the "selfishness" in their minds, and firmly established the great public spirit of Mao Zedong Thought. Third, they resisted the interference of external petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Because the two factions in the Mao Zedong Thought study class combined learning with application and fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, they achieved immediate results. Therefore, when negotiating the specific issues of achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory, the two factions only took one afternoon to reach an agreement on implementing revolutionary great unity from the bottom up by workshop, department, and team. After active preparations by the two factions, the revolutionary workers' congress was quickly established.

    武汉肉类联合加工厂两派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，开始，学员的活思想很多，两派对立情绪很大。三次谈联合都未谈成。但两派在解放军帮助下——
    活学活用毛主席最新指示  实现革命大联合立竿见影
    据新华社武汉电　武汉肉类联合加工厂两派革命群众组织认真学习伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，在驻厂解放军同志的帮助下，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，树立一个“忠”字，猛斗一个“私”字，狠抓一个“用”字，活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了全厂的革命大联合。
    这个厂两派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班的特点是，全厂办，车间办，上上下下都是两派联合办。现在，这个厂按车间自下而上地成立了革命工代会，实现了革命大联合。
    他们的主要经验是：
    （一）树立对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限忠心，这是端正学习态度，办好学习班，促进革命大联合的最根本的保证。
    在学习班刚办起来时，参加学习的人活思想很多，两派对立情绪很大。他们三次谈联合，因为双方总是互揭疮疤，互相攻击，三次都未谈成。为了尽快地把两派头头和革命群众用毛泽东思想统一起来，学习班在解放军的帮助和支持下，引导大家大谈毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，大谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，看毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利；大谈毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，看毛主席对马列主义划时代的新发展。两派头头和革命群众越谈越兴奋，越谈越热烈，越谈思想越拢，大家在无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情上统一起来了。同时，两派在学习班里还共同忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席革命路线的甜；忆两派打“内战”的苦，比共同战斗的甜。通过谈、看、忆、比，两派的对立情绪逐步消除，各自检查了过去没有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的缺点，进一步树立了对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限忠心。这样，实现革命大联合就有了共同的思想基础。
    （二）猛斗一个“私”字，改造世界观。
    学习班自始至终狠狠抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲不放，狠狠抓住自我批评的武器不放。在学习班里，两派头头和革命群众对实现革命大联合的认识虽然逐步提高，但是双方对当着对方的面亮出自己的私字和进行自我批评，还有各种顾虑。他们怕对方抓住“辫子”。在解放军同志的帮助下，大家反复学习毛主席的最新指示，认识到在大联合中敢不敢遵照毛主席的教导亮私斗私，多做自我批评，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线忠不忠的根本态度问题，是能不能实现思想革命化的关键。大家打消顾虑，自觉地猛斗一个“私”字，改造思想，实现革命大联合。大家深有体会地说：“私”字当头，百想不通；我字抛开，一通百通。
    （三）狠抓一个“用”字，努力建立革命好学风。
    参加学习班的两派，在解放军同志的帮助下，针对过去学用不结合、言行不一致、理论脱离实际的倾向，狠抓一个“用”字，树立理论和实际相结合的革命好学风。大家对照毛主席的教导，认真检查了自己在这方面存在的问题。他们严肃地指出：学了毛主席著作不用，就是对毛主席不忠，对毛主席指示执行不坚决，就是最大的“私”。他们在解决革命大联合问题的过程中，主要从三方面狠抓一个“用”字：一是破私立公，言行一致。亮私，就一锅端；斗私，就一刀切。二是学习班的两派头头和革命群众，深入到车间，向各派革命群众大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害，大讲革命大联合的好处，大破头脑里的“私”字，大立毛泽东思想的大公。三是抵制外来的小资产阶级派性的干扰。
    由于两派在毛泽东思想学习班里学用结合，斗私批修，收到了立竿见影的效果，所以在协商实现全厂革命大联合的具体问题的时候，两派只用了一个下午就达成了按车间、科室、班组自下而上地实行革命大联合的协议。经过两派积极筹备，很快成立了革命工代会。
