The military and civilians of South Vietnam have started the year with a series of victories, frequently reporting successes. In the provinces of West Ninh, Ninh An, Cho Lon, Bien Hoa, Di Linh, Soc Trang, and Tra Vinh, over 2,500 enemy soldiers were eliminated in just seven days. This includes the annihilation of one U.S. Army battalion, six companies, and one enemy battalion and two companies. More than 30 enemy aircraft were shot down, 97 military vehicles and over 30 artillery pieces and mortars were destroyed, and a large amount of weapons and military supplies were seized.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on January 13, the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province of South Vietnam bravely and cleverly entered the enemy's stronghold in Quang Ngai City on January 12, successfully blowing up the fake city hall.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the explosion occurred around 11:30 AM. After the people's liberation armed forces infiltrated Quang Ngai City, they skillfully planted landmines in the fake city hall. Immediately, a huge explosion destroyed the enemy's nest, injuring several enemy soldiers. After the explosion, the U.S.-puppet forces were terrified and panicked. The United Press International lamented that this explosion showed that the people's liberation armed forces have the ability to carry out attacks in government-defended cities.

According to another report, on January 11, the people's liberation armed forces in the Mekong Delta engaged in fierce battles with a group of U.S. invading troops that had come to "sweep" the area, killing and wounding nearly 70 U.S. aggressors. On the same morning, the people's liberation armed forces also launched a fierce attack on an enemy camp, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties.

    广义省解放武装力量突袭广义市炸毁伪市政大厅
    据新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方南部各省军民，热烈响应胡志明主席新的战斗号召，向敌人发动连续的进攻。
    据不完全统计，西宁、新安、堤岸、边和、迪石、朔庄和茶荣等省军民，在今年年初七天内，消灭美伪军二千五百多名，其中包括歼灭美军一个营、六个连和伪军一个营两个连，击落敌机三十多架，击毁军车九十七辆和大炮、迫击炮三十多门，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    新华社十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方广义省人民解放武装力量，十二日英勇机智地进入这个省的敌人心脏——广义市，一举炸毁伪市政大厅。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次爆炸是在当天上午十一时三十分左右发生的。人民解放武装力量潜入广义市后，巧妙地在伪市政大厅里埋上了地雷。紧接着，一阵巨响，敌人的这座巢穴被炸毁，一些敌军被炸伤。爆炸发生后，美伪集团胆战心惊，惶惶不安。合众国际社哀叹这次爆炸使人们注意到人民解放武装力量“有能力在政府设防的城市里”进行袭击。
    另据报道，战斗在湄公河三角洲的人民解放武装力量十一日同一批前来“扫荡”的美国侵略军进行了激烈的战斗，打死打伤美国强盗近七十名。同一天清晨，人民解放武装力量还猛烈袭击了一个伪军营，使敌人遭受严重伤亡。
