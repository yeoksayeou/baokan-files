The situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The great call by our great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" is powerfully promoting the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, causing the Soviet revisionist traitors to feel extremely panicked and terrified. Thus, the Soviet revisionists have been working their propaganda machine at full capacity, maliciously slandering and saying that this is "opposing people's thinking" and an "attack on the rights and living conditions of the working people." Such arguments are utterly absurd and shameless!

"Opposing people's thinking." Opposing whose thinking? Opposing what kind of thinking? In a class society, people are divided into classes. People of different classes have different thoughts. The core of the proletarian ideological system is the character "public"; the core of the exploitative class's ideological system is the character "private." These two ideological systems and two worldviews are incompatible.

The bourgeois ideological system serves the economic foundation of capitalism. The proletariat has seized power and changed the economic foundation of society, so it must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the old ideology, which is the bourgeois ideology, that does not fit the new economic foundation; it must establish the new ideology, which is the proletarian ideology, that serves the new economic foundation, and establish the proletariat's dominance in the ideological realm. In a person's mind, there is also a struggle between two ideologies and two worldviews, that is, the struggle between "public" and "private," either the proletarian ideology defeats the bourgeois ideology, or the bourgeois ideology defeats the proletarian ideology.

The great teacher Lenin said: "We must resolutely struggle against all bourgeois ideology, no matter how fashionable and elegant its disguise." "Criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" is to criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology and repudiate revisionist ideology. The Soviet revisionist traitors want to use abstract and vague "people's thinking" to obscure the class nature of people's thoughts, thereby protecting the exploitative class's ideological system and covering up the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat, which is absolutely not possible.

"Attack on the rights and living conditions of the working people." This gang of traitors to the proletariat and anti-China clowns are putting on a show of "concern" for the rights and living conditions of the Chinese working people, isn't that laughable?

In a socialist society, the reliable guarantee of the rights and living conditions of the working people lies in the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the development of the socialist system. However, the private ownership concept has a corrosive and destructive effect on the socialist economic foundation. If private ownership is not relentlessly eliminated, the socialist economic foundation cannot be consolidated and developed, and there is a danger of capitalist restoration. The Soviet revisionist traitors accuse the attack on the private ownership concept as an "attack on the rights and living conditions of the working people," which is utterly absurd.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has comprehensively summarized the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, especially the serious lessons of the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, and proposed the theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. He personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" is the fundamental guideline for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the ideological realm. It is the fundamental policy to ensure the comprehensive victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is precisely to uproot revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure that China's socialist mountains will never change color. This is precisely to truly guarantee the rights and living conditions of the working people.

The Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union usurped the leadership of the party and the state, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and carried out a comprehensive capitalist restoration, causing serious damage to the rights and living conditions of the broad Soviet working people, making them once again become slaves of capitalism; while a small handful of the bourgeois privileged class enjoy various privileges of riding on the heads of the people, living a life of extreme luxury and extravagance. The Soviet revisionist clique's promotion of "material incentives" and "profit-first" is precisely to maintain their revisionist rule and maintain the "rights and living conditions" of a small handful of the bourgeois privileged class. When the Soviet revisionist lords sing about "concern" for the living conditions of the working people and wave the "communist" flag of Western shoes and overcoats, the Soviet people see only the capitalist marks on their backsides.

The Soviet revisionist traitors are so hateful and fearful of the "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" guideline precisely because these traitors' souls are filled with the character "private." The bourgeois ideology, with "private" as its core, is the ideological foundation of the revisionist reactionary rule. Therefore, the "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" guideline hits the vital point of the Soviet revisionist traitors, making the Soviet lords extremely distressed. To cover up their traitorous faces and to resist the great influence of the "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" guideline among the Soviet people, this gang of traitors maliciously slanders the "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" guideline, which is nothing strange.

However, no matter how the Soviet revisionist traitors attack and curse, the great call by our great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" will mobilize the hundreds of millions of people in our country to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in politics, ideology, and theory, smash the ideological system of the exploitative class, and unite the entire nation under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This will make China forever a strong fortress of the world revolution.

The great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the bitter lessons of the comprehensive capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union have educated the Soviet people from both positive and negative aspects, and are making the Soviet people increasingly awakened. They will rise up to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and regain their liberation.

    苏修叛徒的悲鸣
    凯青
    中国无产阶级文化大革命形势一派大好，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，正有力地推动无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，使苏修叛徒集团感到极大的惊慌和恐惧。于是，苏修的宣传机器开足马力，进行恶毒的污蔑，胡说什么这是“反对人的思维”，是“向劳动人民的权利和生活条件进攻”。这种论调实在荒唐透顶！无耻至极！
      “反对人的思维”。反对什么人的思维？反对人的什么样的思维？在阶级社会，人是划分为阶级的。不同阶级的人，具有不同的思想。无产阶级思想体系的核心，是一个
  “公”字；剥削阶级思想体系的核心，是一个“私”字。两种思想体系、两种世界观是水火不相容的。
    资产阶级的思想体系，是为资本主义的经济基础服务的。无产阶级取得了政权，改变了社会的经济基础，就必须大破与新的经济基础不相适应的旧思想，即资产阶级思想；大立为新经济基础服务的新思想，即无产阶级思想，建立无产阶级在思想领域中的统治地位。在一个人的头脑里，也存在着两种思想、两种世界观的斗争，即“公”和
  “私”的斗争，不是无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想，就是资产阶级思想战胜无产阶级思想。
    伟大的导师列宁说过：“我们应当坚决地同一切资产阶级思想作斗争，不管它披着怎样时髦而华丽的外衣。”“斗私，批修”就是要斗资产阶级思想，批修正主义思想。苏修叛徒想用抽象的、笼统的“人的思维”，来抹煞人的思想的阶级性，借以保护剥削阶级思想体系，掩护资产阶级向无产阶级的进攻，那是绝对办不到的。
      “向劳动人民的权利和生活条件进攻”。这一伙无产阶级的叛徒和反华小丑竟装出一副“关心”中国劳动人民的权利和生活的样子，不是太可笑了吗？
    在社会主义社会中，劳动人民的权利和生活条件的可靠保证，在于无产阶级专政的巩固和社会主义制度的发展。而私有观念对社会主义的经济基础起着腐蚀和破坏作用，如果不是坚持不懈地去肃清私有观念，社会主义经济基础就不能巩固和发展，就有资本主义复辟的危险。苏修叛徒把对私有观念的进攻诬蔑为“向劳动人民的权利和生活条件进攻”，这是绝顶荒唐的。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席全面地总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是苏联资本主义复辟的严重教训，提出了在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论，并亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席提出“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号召，是无产阶级文化大革命在思想领域中的根本纲领。它是保证我国无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的根本方针。这正是为了挖掉修正主义的根子，防止资本主义复辟，使中国的社会主义江山永不变色。这正是为了真正保障劳动人民的权利和生活条件。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团在苏联篡夺了党和国家的领导，把无产阶级专政变成为资产阶级专政，实行了全面的资本主义复辟，给苏联广大劳动人民的权利和生活条件带来了严重的损害，使他们重新沦为资本主义的奴隶；而一小撮资产阶级特权阶层，则享有骑在人民头上的种种特权，过着穷奢极欲的资产阶级生活。苏修集团大搞什么
  “物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”，就是为了维护他们的修正主义统治，维护一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的“权利和生活条件”。当苏修老爷们高唱“关心”劳动人民生活，拿着西方皮鞋加大衣的“共产主义”破旗拚命挥舞的时候，苏联人民看到的却是这些老爷们屁股上的资本主义标记。
    苏修叛徒集团所以这样痛恨和害怕“斗私，批修”纲领，就是因为他们这一伙叛徒的灵魂里充满了“私”字，就是因为以“私”字为核心的资产阶级思想，是修正主义反动统治的思想基础。因此，“斗私，批修”纲领，击中了苏修叛徒集团的要害，使得苏修老爷们懊恼万分。为了掩饰自己的叛徒嘴脸，为了抵制“斗私，批修”纲领在苏联人民中的巨大影响，这一伙叛徒疯狂污蔑“斗私，批修”纲领，又有什么奇怪呢？
    但是，不管苏修叛徒集团如何攻击、咒骂，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的“斗私，批修”的战斗号召，必将动员我国亿万人民从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，摧毁剥削阶级的思想体系，使全国人民统一于伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜之下，使中国永远成为世界革命的坚强堡垒。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，和苏联资本主义全面复辟的惨痛教训，从正反两个方面教育了苏联人民，正在促使苏联人民日益觉醒。他们必将起来推翻苏修集团的反动统治，重新获得解放。
