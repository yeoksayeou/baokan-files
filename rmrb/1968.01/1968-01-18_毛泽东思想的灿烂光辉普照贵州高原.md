The radiant glory of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Guizhou Plateau.

The conference emphasized that Chairman Mao's latest directives must be implemented immediately, thoroughly, and with visible results.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang, in the midst of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Guizhou Military District held a conference of representatives of active learners and users of Chairman Mao's works throughout the province in December last year. The conference, with the theme of "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism," summarized and exchanged experiences in the province's military and civilian population's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the more than one year of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives, filled with revolutionary fervor, praised Chairman Mao, the great leader, praised the great Mao Zedong Thought, and praised Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and resolute adherence to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment would lead to victory after victory.

This conference was a grand review and elevation of the mass movement of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in Guizhou Province. It was a rally to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The holding of the conference marked that the mass movement of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in Guizhou Province had reached a new and higher level. The radiant glory of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Guizhou Plateau.

Over 3,000 representatives attended the conference, including soldiers and officers of the Guizhou Military District who had made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, outstanding workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and militiamen who were both revolutionary vanguards and production models, Red Guards who were riding the high tide of the educational revolution, revolutionary intellectuals who were closely linked with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary leading cadres who were fighting shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses.

The representatives, together with the military and civilian population of the province, had striven to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the more than one year of the Cultural Revolution. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to smash the counter-revolutionary plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to restore capitalism in Guizhou. They seized the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. After the victory of the seizure of power by the revolutionary masses, they continued to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the guiding principle. They carried out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, developed and consolidated revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combinations, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and actively carried out the educational revolution. Thus, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province achieved one victory after another.

When the representatives reviewed the great achievements made in more than a year, they were deeply moved and said that every bit of our achievements is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is forever our beacon of victory. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They would follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can we achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives resolutely declared that they would implement every battle order and every latest directive issued by Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. They would act immediately, understand deeply, and carry out resolutely without any discount.

The conference believed that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line meant that one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works immediately after learning them, especially in struggles. Whether one studies Chairman Mao's works or not is an important sign to distinguish a thorough revolutionary from a verbal revolutionary. It is a big issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao. The representatives expressed that they would do whatever Chairman Mao directed immediately and as soon as possible; they would correct whatever Chairman Mao criticized thoroughly, quickly, and as soon as possible; they would learn humbly whatever Chairman Mao praised and definitely master it.

All the representatives attending the conference expressed that they would definitely respond to the battle call of the great leader Chairman Mao, take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the guiding principle, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as weapons, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and thoroughly reform their world outlook.

The conference enthusiastically responded to the great battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The representatives pointed out that they would definitely establish the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, make the study classes better and better, and institutionalize them as a long-term and regular activity. Thus, the mass movement of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works would continuously deepen and develop.

Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Guizhou Military District attended the conference. Comrade Zhang Ming and Comrade He Guangyu made reports at the conference.

The conference commended a large number of advanced collectives and active individuals in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, setting up good examples of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Among them were the "March 1st" Combat Team of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, which first realized revolutionary great alliances by administrative departments; the revolutionary masses of the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who made outstanding contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province; the People's Armed Forces Department of Guiding County, who firmly supported the leftist masses and made new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the revolutionary young fighters of Guiyang New Girls' Middle School, who charged into the battle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the Party branch secretary and militia instructor Wang Zhujin of Baiyao Production Brigade, Duliang Commune, Xiuwen County, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fought unyieldingly against class enemies; the platoon leader Zong Renxian of a certain unit of the PLA, who had consistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively and made great achievements in supporting the left for many years; the old worker and model worker Li Jinhui, who made new contributions to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and so on.

The conference passed a telegram of congratulations to our great leader Chairman Mao in the midst of the warmest applause.

    据新华社贵阳电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，贵州省革命委员会和贵州省军区，在去年十二月召开了全省活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。大会以“斗私，批修”为纲，总结交流了全省军民在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的经验，大赞大颂伟大领袖毛主席，大赞大颂伟大的毛泽东思想，大赞大颂毛主席的革命路线。代表们满怀革命激情地说，无限忠于毛主席，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就能从胜利走向胜利。
