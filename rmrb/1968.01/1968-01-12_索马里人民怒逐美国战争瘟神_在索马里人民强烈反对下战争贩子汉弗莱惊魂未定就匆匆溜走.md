	Mogadishu, Jan. 10 (New China News Agency) — The U.S. imperialist war hawk, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, arrived in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, on January 7, but was met with strong opposition from the Somali people. He stayed in Mogadishu for only about seven hours before leaving in a disgraced manner.

	Before Humphrey's arrival, hundreds of Somali people staged demonstrations to protest against the visit of this U.S. war hawk. When Humphrey was driven from the airport to his residence, the Somali crowd shouted slogans such as "Down with Humphrey!" One Somali transport worker shouted, "Long live China!" "No to the United States!"

	The Somali Youth League, the Somali Students' Union, the Somali Women's League, and the Somalia Committee for Supporting Vietnam distributed leaflets and cartoons protesting against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	One of the leaflets read: "Humphrey is one of the chief architects of the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam and the whole of Southeast Asia. He is also one of the accomplices of the Zionist aggressors who are in collusion with U.S. imperialism to launch aggression against the Arab people." The leaflet pointed out: The U.S. government has become the common enemy of the people of the world. It is the enemy of peace and freedom. The leaflet said: "Let us shout with indignation and hatred: 'Humphrey, go back!' 'Stop U.S. aggression!'"

	The leaflet said: "We, the Somali people, support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression."

    索马里人民怒逐美国战争瘟神
    在索马里人民强烈反对下战争贩子汉弗莱惊魂未定就匆匆溜走
    据新华社十日讯　摩加迪沙消息：美帝国主义战争贩子、副总统汉弗莱于七日到索马里首都摩加迪沙活动，遭到索马里人民的强烈反对。他在摩加迪沙只呆了大约七个小时，就狼狈不堪地离开了那里。
    在汉弗莱到达索马里的前夕，数以百计的索马里人民举行了示威游行，反对这个美国战争贩子到索马里“访问”。在汉弗莱从机场乘车到他的住所去的时候，索马里群众高呼“打倒汉弗莱”的口号。一位索马里运输工人说：“中国好！”“不要美国”。
    索马里青年联盟、索马里学生联合会、索马里妇女联盟和索马里声援越南委员会等群众组织散发了抗议美国侵越战争的传单和漫画。
    有一张传单写道：“汉弗莱是美国对越南和整个东南亚的侵略政策的最高决策人之一。他是同美帝国主义勾结对阿拉伯人民发动侵略战争的犹太复国主义分子的帮凶之一。”传单指出：美国政府已经成为全世界人民的死敌，它是和平和自由的敌人。传单说：让我们满怀愤怒和仇恨大喝一声：“汉弗莱，滚回去！”“制止美国侵略！”。
    传单说：“我们索马里人民支持越南人民反美侵略的正义斗争。”
