The entire army resolutely follows the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to raise the level of revolutionization and modernization.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers are earnestly implementing the combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial, determined to further carry out the "three supports, two military" tasks, resolutely smash the war provocations of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and achieve new victories in defending the motherland and defending the Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated January 3rd, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces are studying the New Year's editorial "Welcoming the Comprehensive Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They are determined to, with the highest enthusiasm, greatest resolve, and swiftest action, fully implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and achieve new victories for the people in the new year.

In recent days, the officers and soldiers of various military branches and services have, while studying the New Year's editorial, earnestly summarized the work of the past year and formulated the goals and specific measures for the new year. Many military units have made decisions and issued notices, requiring subordinate units to quickly implement the principles and tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial. Wang Tao, the political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, expounded on the New Year's editorial point by point at a meeting of over 2,000 people and put forward implementation requirements. The party committee of a certain unit of the Nanjing Air Force studied and implemented the editorial while learning, going down to the companies, assisting grassroots cadres and soldiers in formulating goals and measures based on specific situations, and implementing the various combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial. A certain unit of the Guilin garrison has, based on the summary of last year's work, already formulated this year's work plan.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers in various units have expressed that in the new year, they will definitely better implement the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, highlight proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, promote the Three-Eight Style, carry forward the Three Great Democracies, carry out the Four Good Units movement, deeply conduct education on the struggle between the two lines, and raise the construction of our army's revolutionization and modernization to a higher level. The leaders at various levels of a certain unit of the Jilin garrison fully listened to the soldiers' opinions while studying the New Year's editorial. They summarized the future work of cadres in the construction of the unit in terms of how to highlight proletarian politics and how to insist on the Four Firsts in two words: "follow" and "lead." "Follow" means to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and "lead" means to take the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A certain flight squadron of the Air Force, which has been rated as a Four Good Unit for four consecutive years, found gaps and formulated measures during the study. They believe that although they have won the Four Good Unit honor for four years, they are still far from the higher level of revolutionization and modernization construction proposed in the editorial. They must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and advance in big strides along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. The famous units such as the "Iron Red Second Company" of a certain unit of the Guangzhou garrison, the "Good Eighth Company" on Nanjing Road, the "Model Red Ninth Company" for studying Chairman Mao's works, the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company," and the units where the great proletarian revolutionary warriors Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and Li Wenzhong were once stationed, all regard studying, applying, and implementing the combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial as the first battle of ideological and political work in 1968. They are determined to follow the direction indicated by the great commander Chairman Mao and raise the construction of our army's revolutionization and modernization to a higher level.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers executing the "three supports, two military" tasks in factories, rural areas, schools, and organs have unanimously expressed that in the new year, they will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, take the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed in Beijing Knitting Factory, the "Support-Left and Love the People Model Platoon," and the model Li Wenzhong as examples, further carry out the "three supports, two military" work, and further carry out the work of loving the people. The leaders of the Wuhan garrison and the support-left personnel of a certain unit of the Anhui garrison all studied the New Year's editorial with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and expressed their determination to make Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and specific policies directly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses and turned into the conscious revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses. The support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed in Beijing Knitting Factory and the "Support-Left and Love the People Model Platoon" of the 601st Unit, which have made outstanding contributions in executing the support-left tasks, as well as the comrades of the Beijing Pinggu County People's Armed Forces Department, who are praised as the support-left red flag, reviewed their combat course over more than a year, and resolutely expressed that they must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to do the support-left work better.

In the coastal defense frontlines of Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, as well as in the garrisons of the Shandong Peninsula and the Liaodong Peninsula, after listening to the broadcast of the New Year's editorial, they enthusiastically carried out discussions. They unanimously expressed that they must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    全军坚决按照毛主席指引的方向  把革命化现代化建设提到更高水平
    广大指战员认真贯彻元旦社论中提出的战斗任务，决心进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，坚决粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅，为保卫祖国，保卫文化大革命立新功
    据新华社三日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》，决心以最高的热情，最大的决心和最快的行动全面落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，在新的一年中为人民立新功。
    连日来，各军种兵种部队的指战员，结合学习元旦社论，认真总结过去一年的工作，制定新的一年的奋斗目标和具体措施。许多部队党委作出决定，发出通知，要求所属部队迅速把元旦社论中提出的方针、任务落实到行动中去。内蒙古军区政治委员吴涛同志，在两千多人的大会上逐条宣讲了元旦社论，并提出了落实的要求。南京空军某部党委委员，边学习，边贯彻，分别下到连队，协助基层干部、战士结合具体情况，订目标，提措施，落实元旦社论中提出的各项战斗任务。桂林驻军某部，在总结过去一年工作的基础上，已经制订出今年的工作规划。
    各部队广大指战员纷纷表示，在新的一年中，一定要更好地贯彻执行林彪副主席的指示，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动，深入进行两条路线斗争的教育，把我军革命化、现代化的建设提到一个更高的水平。吉林驻军某部各级领导干部，在学习元旦社论中充分听取了战士的意见。他们对于干部今后在部队建设中如何突出无产阶级政治，如何坚持四个第一，概括为两个字，一个是“跟”，一个是“带”。“跟”就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，“带”就是带头执行毛主席的最新指示。空军某部连续四年被评为四好中队的某飞行中队，在学习中大找差距，大订措施。他们认为，自己虽然四年荣获四好，但距社论中提出的革命化、现代化建设的更高水平的要求，还差得很远，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的方向，大踏步前进。广州部队某部“钢铁红二连”、南京路上好八连、学习毛主席著作的模范红九连、“硬骨头六连”等大批著名连队，以及雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥、李文忠等伟大的无产阶级革命战士生前所在的连队，都把学好、用好、落实好元旦社论中提出的战斗任务，作为一九六八年思想政治工作的第一仗，决心按照伟大统帅毛主席指引的方向，把我军革命化、现代化的建设提到一个更高的水平。
    在工厂、农村、学校、机关执行“三支”“两军”任务的各部队广大指战员一致表示，决心在新的一年中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员和“支左爱民模范排”、“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志为榜样，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，进一步做好爱民工作。武汉部队领导同志和安徽驻军某部支左人员，都同无产阶级革命派一起学习了元旦社论，表示决心使毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策，为广大革命群众直接掌握，变成革命群众自觉的革命行动。在执行支左任务中做出突出贡献的八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员和六○一一部队“支左爱民模范排”，以及被誉为支左红旗的北京平谷县人民武装部的同志，回顾了一年多来的战斗历程，坚决表示，一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的伟大教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，团结一致，把支左工作做得更好。
    在福建、广东、浙江海防前线，以及在山东半岛、辽东半岛执勤的部队，收听了元旦社论的广播后，热烈展开学习讨论。他们一致表示：要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅。
