Indonesia's 1967 export plan has completely failed. The Suharto-Nasution fascist regime's export plan for last year has utterly collapsed. In the first nine months of last year compared to the same period the previous year, the export earnings for rubber, coconut, tobacco, tea, and coconut oil decreased by $69 million. Among these, the primary export commodity, rubber, saw the largest decline in export earnings, amounting to $37 million. The 1967 total budget of the Indonesian fascist regime relies on one-third of its revenue from exports, in addition to taxation and foreign aid. The failure of the export plan makes the reactionary forces in Indonesia, who are already facing internal and external difficulties, even more miserable.

    印尼一九六七年出口计划彻底破产
    印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权一九六七年的出口计划已彻底破产。去年头九个月同前年同期比较，橡胶、椰子、烟叶、茶叶和椰油的出口收入下降六千九百万美元，其中主要出口货物橡胶的出口收入下降最多，达三千七百万美元。印尼法西斯政权一九六七年总预算的收入部分，除靠税收、外援以外，三分之一靠出口。出口计划的破产，使正处在内外交困中的印尼反动派的日子越发难过。
