In the brave counterattack against American air pirates, another glorious victory has been achieved. The late rice harvest in North Vietnam last year was once again bountiful.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the late rice harvest in North Vietnam last year achieved a good yield. This is another glorious victory for the heroic people of the North in their struggle against American air pirates, overcoming difficulties and persevering in production.

According to relevant departments speaking to Xinhua News Agency reporters, the average yield per hectare of late rice across the entire North last year exceeded the highest level since 1961. Hanoi City and Thai Binh Province have become cities and provinces with an average annual yield of five tons per hectare. More than forty counties have become "five-ton counties," an increase of fifteen compared to the previous year.

Due to the continuous escalation of the war by American imperialism, the struggle against American air pirates from last year has been more intense than the previous year, from the areas near the 17th parallel in the Vinh Linh region to the provinces near the Vietnam-China border such as Lang Son and Lao Cai, from the Red River Delta plain to the western mountainous areas. The people of North Vietnam are fighting bravely against American air pirates while accelerating production to support the front lines. Various regions' agricultural cooperatives have put forward the slogan: "In battle, we must shoot down more enemy planes, and in production, we must defeat the American imperialists."

From the overall organization of production, the allocation of labor, to the arrangement of working hours, all have been appropriately adjusted and arranged according to the wartime environment.

Last year, American pirate planes carried out increasingly frenzied bombings of the Hanoi city area and its suburbs. Especially in November, when the suburban people were harvesting late rice, American pirates repeatedly launched large-scale attacks on the Hanoi city area and its suburbs. The people of Hanoi's suburbs, in their fierce battle against American air pirates, overcame numerous difficulties, persevered in production, and ultimately achieved a good late rice harvest. The previous year, only three counties in the suburbs reached an average annual yield of five tons per hectare. Last year, the entire Hanoi suburban area had an average annual yield of more than five tons per hectare, with twenty cooperatives reaching an average annual yield of more than six tons per hectare.

The key rice-producing area of Vinh Bao County in the suburbs of Hai Phong, which has been continuously bombed by American air pirates, has also completed the late rice harvest. Preliminary statistics show an average yield of more than two tons per hectare. The annual average yield per hectare reached more than five tons, an increase of nearly five hundred kilograms compared to the previous year.

Under the continuous bombing by American air pirates, the people of Quang Binh Province bravely overcame various difficulties and achieved a good harvest. In the early stages of planting late rice, due to enemy bombing, some rice fields had to be replanted four times. Then, they encountered a severe drought lasting seven months without a drop of rain. Many community members had to carry water from a distance of one kilometer to irrigate the fields, and some even took water from bomb craters to combat the drought. When the harvest season arrived, enemy planes dropped many cluster bombs and timed bombs in the rice fields. Local people, while bravely defusing the timed bombs, harvested the late rice, and the yield per hectare also increased compared to the previous year.

The members of the New Prosperity Cooperative in Thai Binh Province, with the heroic spirit of "decisively defeating the American pirates on the production front," worked hard to ensure a good late rice harvest.

### 在英勇反击美国空中强盗战斗中又一辉煌胜利  越南北方去年晚稻又获丰收

    在英勇反击美国空中强盗战斗中又一辉煌胜利
    越南北方去年晚稻又获丰收
    据新华社河内电　越南北方去年晚稻又获得好收成。这是英雄的北方人民在反击美国空中强盗的激烈战斗中克服困难，坚持生产取得的又一个辉煌的胜利。
    据有关部门对新华社记者说，整个北方去年晚稻每公顷平均产量，超过了一九六一年以来的最高水平。河内市郊、太平省已成为平均每公顷年产量达到五吨的市、省。还有四十多个县成为“五吨县”，比前年增加了十五个。
    由于美帝国主义不断进行战争“升级”，去年以来，从靠近十七度线的永灵区到靠近中越边界的谅山、老街等省，从红河三角洲平原到西部山区，反击美国空中强盗的斗争都比前年激烈。越南北方人民一面奋勇抗击美国空中强盗，一面加紧生产，支援前线。各地区的农业合作社提出了“既要在战斗中打落更多的敌机，又要在生产上战胜美帝”的响亮口号。从整个生产组织、劳动力的分配到劳动时间的安排都根据战时环境作了适当的调整和安排。
    去年，美国强盗飞机对河内市区和郊区进行了日益疯狂的轰炸。特别是在去年十一月份正当郊区人民收割晚稻的时候，美国强盗多次大规模袭击河内市区和郊区。河内郊区人民在同美国空中强盗激烈的战斗中，克服重重困难，坚持生产，终于使去年的晚稻又获得好收成。前年市郊只有三个县达到每公顷平均年产量五吨，去年整个河内市郊区平均每公顷年产量超过五吨，其中二十个合作社达到每公顷年产量六吨以上。
    遭到美国空中强盗不断轰炸的海防市郊区的重点产稻区永保县，晚稻也已收割完毕。据初步统计，平均每公顷产量二吨零八百多公斤。全年平均每公顷产量达到五吨多，比前年增产近五百公斤。
    广平省人民在美国空中强盗不断狂轰滥炸的情况下，奋勇战胜各种困难，获得了好收成。某乡人民在栽种晚稻初期，由于敌机狂轰滥炸，有的稻田要重新插秧四次。接着，又遇到七个月没有下过一滴雨的严重旱灾，许多社员要从一公里外的地方挑水回来灌田，有的还从炸弹坑里取水抗旱。到了收割季节，敌机又在稻田里投下了许多珠型炸弹和定时炸弹。当地人民一边英勇地排除定时炸弹，一边收割晚稻，每公顷产量也比前年有所增加。
    太平省新丰合作社的社员们以“在生产战线上决战决胜美国强盗”的英雄气概加紧努力生产，保证了晚稻的好收成。
