Premier Zhou Enlai today received the Vietnamese South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe led by Nguyen Van Hung. He had a very cordial and friendly conversation with them.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended a warm welcome to the revolutionary cultural warriors from the front lines of the anti-American national salvation war in South Vietnam. He wished the South Vietnamese military and people greater victories in their struggle to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "In his New Year's message to all Vietnamese military and people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a poem: 'This year's spring is better than last year's, the whole country is rejoicing with good news. North and South compete to defeat the American imperialists, steadfastly advancing towards victory!' This poem accurately reflects the excellent situation of the Vietnamese military and people's anti-American national salvation war and expresses their firm revolutionary will and confidence in victory. We are very pleased to read it."

Nguyen Van Hung, the troupe leader, enthusiastically toasted to Chairman Mao's longevity and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's good health. He said, "Our song and dance troupe is very happy to hear Chairman Mao's telegram congratulating President Nguyen Huu Tho on the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Chairman Mao's telegram has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese military and people. Chairman Mao said in the telegram, 'The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the firm fighting unity of the peoples of our two countries, any military adventurism and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to failure. Victory will certainly belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!' This makes the Vietnamese people even more happy and encouraged."

At the end of the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai told everyone that the people and the party of our country will give each member of the troupe a gun and encourage them to return to the front lines, kill more American aggressors, and strive for the final victory of the anti-American national salvation war. Nguyen Van Hung, the troupe leader, said that the troupe will definitely hold a musical instrument in one hand and a gun in the other, and create new achievements for the motherland on the battlefield.

Those who participated in the reception included Vice Premier Chen Yi, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wen Yucheng, and others.

The head of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Van Quang, and the acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, Le Chung Chi, were also present at the reception.
