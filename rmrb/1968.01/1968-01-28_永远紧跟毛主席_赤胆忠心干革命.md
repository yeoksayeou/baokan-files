	Forever Follow Chairman Mao
	With Loyalty and Devotion to the Revolution
	Representative of the Fourth Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the General Staff Department, Shi Xinren

	Dearest Chairman Mao! You are the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the contemporary proletariat, the greatest genius, and the eternal red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. With you, the future of the world revolution is bright; with you, the future of humanity is brilliant and glorious. The Chinese people love you, the people of the world admire you, and revolutionary fighters think of you day and night. For so many years, I have been longing, longing! How I yearned to see you one day!

	On January 26, 1968, my most beautiful wish finally came true. Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and other central leaders received us, the representatives of the Fourth Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the General Staff Department. This is the greatest happiness, the greatest honor, and the greatest pride of my life. When Chairman Mao, with his radiant and vigorous steps, walked towards us, I felt the brilliant sunlight filling my heart. I could not suppress my immense excitement; a thousand words surged in my heart, my blood boiled, and tears of joy flowed. I shouted loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" I sincerely wished: "May Chairman Mao live forever!"

	At this most happy moment, I couldn't help but recall the days of struggle in Indonesia. In October 1965, after the Indonesian reactionary military seized power, they massacred tens of thousands of revolutionary people within the country; externally, they aligned with the U.S. and the Soviet Union against China, organizing thugs to attack our diplomatic missions in Indonesia multiple times. The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia faced a severe test. At that time, although we were far from our motherland, Chairman Mao! You seemed to be by our side. Your brilliant thoughts gave us boundless wisdom, infinite courage, and immense strength.

	It was you who taught us the great truth that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." When the enemy was snarling, we saw through its reactionary and weak nature and dared to engage in a head-on struggle.

	It was you who taught us that "in times of difficulty, we must see achievements, see brightness, and raise our courage." Although dark clouds rolled in, we were always full of confidence in our situation and the future of the Indonesian revolutionary people.

	It was you who taught us that "this army has an indomitable spirit, it will overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and arduous the circumstances, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." To defend the dignity of our motherland, we bravely advanced without fear, fighting unarmed against fully armed police and thugs with weapons, time and time again.

	It was you who taught us to "make up our minds, not to be afraid of sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory." When the enemy's weapons struck us, and the enemy's guns were aimed at our chests, we remained calm. We made sure that the five-star red flag of our motherland always flew high above the embassy!

	"The ship sails with the helmsman, the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every achievement and every step forward we made in the international class struggle is the result of your patient guidance and the victory of your brilliant thoughts. Today, I and my comrades have come to your side. We will turn your reception into a great motivating and driving force for our lifelong progress. I am determined to follow you, to devote my life to the revolution, and to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world forever. I will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will forever be loyal to you, loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and loyal to your revolutionary line. Even if my body is crushed, my heart will not change; even if my head is cut off and my blood flows, my will will not waver.

    永远紧跟毛主席
    赤胆忠心干革命
    总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表  时心仁
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才，是全世界革命人民心中永远不落的红太阳。有了您，世界革命前程似锦；有了您，人类前途灿烂辉煌。全中国人民热爱您，全世界人民敬仰您，革命战士日日夜夜想念您。多少年来，我盼啊，盼啊！多么渴望能有一天见到您老人家！
    一九六八年一月二十六日，我最最美好的愿望终于实现了。毛主席和林副主席以及中央其他领导同志接见了我们出席总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的全体代表。这是我终生难忘的最大幸福、最大光荣、最大骄傲。当毛主席他老人家容光焕发、神采奕奕健步走来的时候，我顿觉灿烂的阳光满胸怀。我怎么也压不住内心的万分激动，千言万语涌心头，热血沸腾热泪流。我放声地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”我衷心地祝愿：“毛主席您老人家万寿无疆！”
    在这最最幸福的时刻，我不禁回想起在印度尼西亚的那些战斗的日子。一九六五年十月，印尼反动军人篡夺政权以后，对内血洗千岛之国，屠杀了数十万革命人民；对外亲美联苏反华，多次组织暴徒袭击了我国驻印尼代表机构。我国驻印尼大使馆的全体同志面临着一场严峻的考验。那个时候，我们虽然远离祖国，但是，毛主席啊！您老人家仿佛就在我们的身旁，您的光辉思想给了我们无穷的智慧、无限的勇气、无比的力量。
    是您教导我们懂得了“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的伟大真理，在敌人张牙舞爪的时候，就看透了它反动而虚弱的本质，敢于进行针锋相对的斗争。
    是您教导我们“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”。尽管一时乌云翻滚，我们对自己的处境，对印尼革命人民的前途，始终充满了胜利的信心。
    是您教导我们“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”为了维护祖国的尊严，我们勇往直前，无所畏惧，赤手空拳地同袭击我们代表机构的全副武装的军警和手持凶器的暴徒进行了一次又一次的激烈搏斗。
    是您教导我们要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。当敌人的凶器打在我们身上，敌人的枪口对准我们胸膛的时候，我们脸不改色心不跳。使祖国的五星红旗始终在使馆上空高高飘扬！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们在国际阶级斗争中的每一点成绩，每一点进步，都是您谆谆教导的结果，都是您光辉思想的胜利。今天，我和同志们来到了您的身边，我们将把您的接见变成永远鼓舞和鞭策自己前进的巨大动力。我决心紧跟您，一辈子干革命，一辈子为中国人民和全世界人民服务。永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，永远忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的革命路线。粉身碎骨心不变，头断血流志不移。
