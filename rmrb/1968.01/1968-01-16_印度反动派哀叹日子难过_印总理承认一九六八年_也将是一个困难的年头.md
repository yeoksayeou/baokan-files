Indian reactionaries, as their situation worsens day by day, cannot hide their anxiety as they reflect on the numerous difficulties they faced in 1967, lamenting that life is becoming increasingly tough.

The Indian reactionary government's Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, gave an interview to the weekly publication _Flash_ on January 6. When discussing the situation facing the Indian reactionary government, she had to admit that "the present is a very difficult period." She sadly said, "We still face a large number of difficulties, including economic and other difficulties."

Indira Gandhi expressed great alarm at the Indian people abandoning the "non-violent" ideology used by the Indian reactionaries to deceive the people and rising up in rebellion. She said: "The trouble is, incidents of brazen violence and various kinds of demonstrations have been widely publicized. Abroad, it creates the impression that we are falling apart. This is unfortunate, isn't it?"

She also had to admit that 1968 "will also be a difficult year."

The bourgeois newspaper _Free Press Journal_ published an editorial on January 1 saying, "1967 was a particularly bad year." It said: "From the beginning of the year's elections, there has been no peace in this country. On the other hand, it suffered from famine." After listing the difficulties faced by the Indian reactionaries in 1967, the paper said: "Even though 1967 has passed, these unfavorable conditions and problems still remain with us."

The bourgeois newspaper _The Hindustan Times_ published a commentary on January 3 acknowledging that "India has gone through a year filled with difficulties, especially in the economic sphere, this year has been more difficult than any other year since independence."

The bourgeois newspaper _The Times of India_ published an article on January 1 revealing that the Indian reactionary government, controlled by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is about to fall into an even more serious economic crisis. It predicted that by the end of the current fiscal year in March 1968, there will be a huge budget deficit. In the next fiscal year, the chances of increasing the central government's revenue are very slim, and the situation for the state governments will be even worse. Due to the deteriorating economic situation in the United States and other Western countries, this newspaper is concerned that the Indian government's begging for "aid" from them will become increasingly difficult.

    印度反动派哀叹日子难过
    印总理承认一九六八年“也将是一个困难的年头”
    新华社讯　新德里消息：一天天烂下去的印度反动派，在回顾一九六七年遭到的重重困难时，无法掩饰自己的忧虑，哀叹日子愈来愈不好过。
    印度《闪电》周报六日刊载了印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地向这家周报发表的谈话。在谈到印度反动政府面临的局势时，她不得不承认
  “现在是一个非常困难的时期”。她悲哀地说，我们仍然面对着大量的困难，包括经济方面的和其它方面的困难。
    英迪拉·甘地对印度人民抛弃印度反动派用来欺骗人民的“非暴力主义”起来造反，表示十分惊慌。她说：“麻烦的是，放肆地使用暴力的事件和各种各样的游行示威，得到了广泛的宣传。在国外它造成了一种印象，我们正在分崩离析。这是不幸的，不是么？”
    她还不得不承认，一九六八年“也将是一个困难的年头”。
    印度资产阶级报纸《自由新闻》报一月一日发表社论说，“一九六七年是一个特别坏的年头”。它说：“从这年年初的大选开始，这个国家看不到有和平的日子。另一方面它却遭到了饥荒。”这家报纸在列举一九六七年印度反动派遇到的困难以后说：“尽管一九六七年已经过去，但这些不利条件和问题仍然留在我们身边。”
    资产阶级报纸《印度斯坦旗报》三日发表的评论承认，“印度又度过了困难重重的一年，特别是在经济方面，这一年比独立以来的二十年中任何一年的困难都要严重。”
    资产阶级报纸《印度时报》一日发表的文章透露受美帝和苏修控制的印度反动政府，将要陷入更加严重的经济危机。它预计，到一九六八年三月底为止的本年度财政预算将出现巨额赤字。在下一财政年度，增加中央政府收入的机会是很少的，各邦政府的收入情况还要更糟些。由于美国等西方国家本身的经济情况也在急剧恶化，这家报纸担心印度政府向它们乞讨“援助”也将愈来愈困难。
