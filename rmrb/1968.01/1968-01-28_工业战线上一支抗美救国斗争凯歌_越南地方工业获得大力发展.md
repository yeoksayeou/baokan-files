In the past two years, while achieving great victories in repelling the bombing and strafing by American aggressor planes and warships, various localities in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have vigorously developed local industries to meet the needs of combat, production, and people's livelihood.

According to statistics, over the past two years, more than 500 industrial facilities adapted to local needs have been established in various localities in North Vietnam. Due to the completion of these industrial facilities, various local industries, including machinery, fertilizers, chemicals, textiles, leather, sewing, and food production, have all seen significant growth compared to 1964, before the American aggressor planes started bombing North Vietnam. Some sectors have seen production increase by 30 percent.

In the past two years, various localities in North Vietnam have particularly emphasized the development of local industries serving agricultural production, resulting in a significant increase in the production of agricultural tools and other products.

Many provinces, including mountainous ones, have achieved self-sufficiency in agricultural tools.

The various localities in North Vietnam have not only rapidly developed machine manufacturing industries but have also, to meet the needs of people's lives, newly built and expanded many consumer goods enterprises.

At the same time, the handicraft industry in the north has also developed.

	Vietnamese factories across the country produce large quantities of agricultural machinery and send them to rural areas, providing strong support for cooperative agricultural production.

    工业战线上一支抗美救国斗争凯歌
    越南地方工业获得大力发展
    新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道：在过去的两年中，越南民主共和国各地在抗击美国强盗飞机、军舰轰炸和扫射取得伟大胜利的同时，大力发展了地方工业，以满足战斗、生产以及人民生活方面的需要。
    据统计，两年来，越南北方各地建立了五百个适应地方需要的工业设施。由于这些工业设施的建成，各种地方工业，包括机械、肥料、化工、纺织、制革、缝纫和食品的生产，同美国强盗飞机开始轰炸越南北方以前的一九六四年相比，都有了很大的增长，有的部门生产增长了百分之三十。
    在过去的两年里，越南北方各地特别重视发展为农业生产服务的地方工业，使得农具等产品的产量大大增长。
    许多省份，包括山区省份在内，农具已经实现自给自足了。
    越南北方各地不仅迅速发展机器制造工业，而且为了满足人民生活的需要，还新建和扩建了许多消费品企业。
    与此同时，北方各地的手工业生产也得到了发展。（附图片）
