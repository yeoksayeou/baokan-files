The red flowers bloom abundantly at the foot of Baigong Mountain, and the sunrise shines brightly on both banks of the Huai River. In the great situation of Huainan City, after experiencing fierce class struggles, a revolutionary mass movement of unprecedented breadth and depth is rapidly developing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. The most prominent feature of the development of the situation is the unprecedented widespread and deep penetration of the great thought of Mao Zedong. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, people are full of vigor and high spirits, striving to build a new Huainan that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Masses Have Been Fully Mobilized

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The important sign of a great situation is that the people have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been mobilized so broadly and deeply as this one." The situation in Huainan is exactly like this: from the city to the suburbs, from the mine workshops to every household, everyone has been swept into the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Let us take a look at the lively political life of the Huainan people through the eyes of an ordinary worker's family!

In the Xiyang District, there is a family of six. The husband is a worker, the wife is a cleaner, the eldest daughter is an apprentice, and the three younger daughters are all students. In the past, when the family gathered, they talked more about household affairs. Now, studying the works of Chairman Mao and discussing political issues have become the first priority in their lives.

This is a revolutionary change. This change began during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As early as last January, the struggle between the two major factions in Huainan swept into this worker's family. The husband and wife each joined a different revolutionary mass organization, first causing a difference in opinion; then, the eldest daughter supported her father, and the three younger daughters supported their mother. When the family was together, they would argue, each speaking for their respective factions, keeping secrets from each other, each holding their own reasoning, and no one could convince the other. The argument temporarily created a rift in the family; the argument also made the family determined to discern right from wrong. What should be used to discern right from wrong? The family turned to the works of Chairman Mao for answers.

At this time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great unity were issued, and the whole family studied them eagerly. The two factions in the family suddenly realized: "We are all workers, what fundamental conflicts of interest do we have? Our revolutionary goals are the same, we should have united long ago!" They abandoned factionalism, opened their hearts, and found that various disagreements and misunderstandings were due to the instigation and sowing of discord by a handful of capitalist roaders and bad elements within the party. Immediately, Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," giving this family new revolutionary momentum. They each examined their factionalism and unanimously declared that they would study Mao Zedong Thought, study, study, and study again, and closely follow, closely follow, and follow again Chairman Mao's latest instructions. From then on, they did not participate in any factional meetings but instead went everywhere to propagate revolutionary great unity. The family said with deep emotion:

"Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, ten thousand good things are not as good as Chairman Mao's teachings, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be parted with even for a moment!"

Now, this family regards studying the works of Chairman Mao as their first need in life. They study in the factory, in school, and at home. There is a "Mao Zedong Thought Big Classroom" column in front of the hall, and each person's study notes are placed inside. The wife, who is illiterate, sometimes copies "Old Three Articles" word by word in the middle of the night. When asked about the changes since the Cultural Revolution, she said: "After reading Chairman Mao's books, I stand taller, see farther, and think bigger."

This worker's family is a microcosm of Huainan's social life. In Huainan, there are thousands of such families! Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated into every family and into the hearts of every individual, fully mobilizing hundreds of millions of people.

Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Are Deeply Rooted in the Hearts of the People

In the fierce class struggle, the broad revolutionary masses of Huainan are increasingly aware of the great significance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They consciously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions at all times. Currently, maintaining revolutionary great unity has become a conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses. The water extraction team of Xie San Mine, after achieving revolutionary great unity, had an individual who took thirty-eight badges and wanted the original leader of a certain organization to distribute them to the original members. The badges were in the leader's hands for four days. To distribute or not to distribute? After a fierce struggle in his thoughts, he realized that distributing the badges was not a small matter but distributing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism along with them. Doing so would not be conducive to consolidating the revolutionary great unity in thought. He studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience," and decided to rely on the masses to solve this problem. He convened a meeting of the original organization's members, first studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great unity, and then reported on the circumstances. The masses were very excited and said: "We have suffered enough from division. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, not be this faction or that faction, but be proletarian revolutionaries who closely follow Chairman Mao and are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" Everyone unanimously decided to write a report of joy and hand in the badges to the leftist support troops. The workers of the other faction, upon hearing of this matter, were inspired and, with drums and gongs, brought the factional flags and badges to hand in. When the two teams merged, their hearts were even more closely connected, and their unity was even stronger.

To propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many women in their forties and fifties from Li Er Mine voluntarily formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They overcame various difficulties and often went to the mines and streets to carry out propaganda activities. When class enemies incited some workers to stop work and production, this family propaganda team countered by propagating Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

There is an old woman named Huang, who was so poor before liberation that she could not even raise her only son, giving him away at the age of six. She was reunited with her son after liberation. She heard that her son, who worked in the mine, was not devoted to production, so she specially followed him into the mine to work and gave him a lecture on family history while working, saying:

"Child, we poor people have only stood up by following Chairman Mao. Now Chairman Mao has entrusted the country to you. The responsibility is heavy! We cannot enjoy the sweetness and forget the bitterness! We must serve the people for as long as we live, and go where Chairman Mao points."

The workers were very moved and said: "The old woman is right, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words!" Closely following Chairman Mao is victory

In the sharp and complex class struggle, the revolutionary masses of Huainan have established a firm belief: "Closely following Chairman Mao is victory! 'What Chairman Mao says, we do!'"

When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the Huainan working class acted swiftly. With the help of the stationed troops, they organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle. Every workshop and every work team became a battlefield for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." In this soul-stirring struggle, many advanced individuals who devoted themselves to the public good emerged.

In the Cultural Revolution, Li Yuanguo, an old worker from Datuong Mine, always followed Chairman Mao's words and firmly guarded his production post. After completing the coal mining task for the day, many people left one by one. He took out his watch and looked at it, thinking: "Let's go, after all, the task is completed, and many people have left!" This thought flashed through his mind, and he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teaching to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," clenched his fist and said: "I cannot leave!" He wiped the sweat from his face and continued to mine three more cars of coal until the relief worker came, and then left happily. Seven minutes is a fleeting moment, and three cars of coal are not much, but as he himself said: "Seven minutes may be short, but the struggle between public and private is not ordinary!"

When the handful of capitalist roaders within the party incited workers to leave their work posts, Zhang Rongguang, a worker from the Xinzhuangzi Mine construction area, voluntarily organized twenty-three workers to insist on the eight-hour workday. They overcame selfish thoughts, fearing neither ridicule nor attacks, overcame various difficulties, and insisted on production.

The working class of Huainan, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, takes it as the highest standard of public spirit. They constantly use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine and check their actions, taking it as their guide to action. They have truly implemented Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production" in their actions, promoting the coal production of the entire mine to rise steadily.

    战地黄花分外香
    ——群众充分发动起来了是淮南大好形势的重要标志
    八公山下红烂漫，淮河两岸尽朝晖。形势大好的淮南市，经历激烈的阶级斗争之后，一个空前广泛和深入的革命群众运动，正沿着毛主席指出的轨道迅速向前发展。形势发展的最显著的特点，就是伟大的毛泽东思想的空前大普及，空前大深入。在毛泽东思想的指引下，人们意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在为建设一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红彤彤的新淮南而奋斗。
    群众充分发动起来了
    毛主席教导我们：“形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”淮南的形势正是这样：从城市到郊区，从矿井车间到每一个家庭，无不投入无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流之中。
    让我们从一个普通工人的家庭，来看一看淮南人民的热烈的政治生活吧！
    向阳区有个六口之家。丈夫是工人，妻子是清洁工，大女儿是学徒工，还有三个小女儿都在上学。过去，一家人聚在一起，谈家务的时候多。现在，学习毛主席著作，讨论政治问题，已成为一家人生活的第一位。
    这是一个翻天覆地的变化。这个变化，是在无产阶级文化大革命中开始的。还在去年一月间，淮南两大派斗争的浪潮，冲进了这个工人家庭。夫妻二人各参加一派革命群众组织，首先产生了思想分歧；接着，大女儿支持父亲，三个小女儿帮着母亲。一家人在一块就辩论，各自为各派说话，各自为各派保密，各持一理，谁也说不服谁。争辩，暂时造成了一家人的隔阂；争辩，也促使一家人决心去鉴别是非。用什么去鉴别是非呢？一家人都到毛主席著作中去寻找答案。
    正在这个时候，毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示传下来了，全家如饥似渴地进行学习。家庭中的两派都恍然大悟地说：“我们一家都是工人，有什么根本的利害冲突？我们的革命目标一致，早就该联合了！”他们抛掉派性，敞开思想谈心，发现种种分歧误会，都是由于党内一小撮走资派和坏人的挑拨离间。紧接着，毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召，又给这一家人以新的革命动力。他们各自检查了自己的派性，一致表示对毛泽东思想要学习，学习，再学习，对毛主席的最新指示要紧跟，紧跟，再紧跟。他们从此不参加任何派会，而是到处宣传革命的大联合。一家人深情地说：
    “爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如毛主席教导好，毛泽东思想一刻也离不了！”
    现在，这一家人把学习毛主席著作，当作生活的第一需要。他们在工厂学，在学校学，回家也学。堂前有“毛泽东思想大课堂”专栏，专栏里有每个人的学习笔记。不识字的妻子，有时深夜还照着“老三篇”一字一句模写。有人问她文化大革命以来有什么变化，她说：“读了毛主席的书，人也站得高了，眼睛看得远了，心里想得大了。”
    这个工人家庭是淮南社会生活的一个缩影，在淮南象这样的家庭何止千百个！毛泽东思想普及到每一个家庭，深入到每一个人心里，就把亿万群众充分发动起来了。
    毛主席最新指示深入人心
    淮南广大革命群众在激烈的阶级斗争中，越来越体会到毛主席一系列最新指示的极为重大的意义。他们时时刻刻自觉地把毛主席的最新指示落实到自己的行动上。当前，维护革命的大联合，成为广大革命群众的自觉行动。谢三矿的水采队在实现革命大联合后，有个人拿了三十八个胸章，要原来某组织的负责人发给原来所属成员。胸章在负责人手里放了四天。发不发呢？经过激烈的思想斗争，他认识到把胸章发下去，不是小事，而是把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性连同发下去了。这样做，不利于从思想上巩固革命的大联合。他学习了毛主席的最新指示“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”，决定依靠群众来解决这个问题。他召集原组织的成员，首先学习了毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，然后汇报了事情的经过。群众很激动地说：“我们吃够了分裂的苦头。我们要听毛主席的话，不当这派那派，要当紧跟毛主席、决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派！”大家一致决定写张喜报把胸章送交支左部队。另一派工人知道了这件事，受到了启发，也敲着锣鼓把派旗、派章送来。两支队伍汇合一起时，他们的心连得更紧了，团结得更牢了。
    为了宣传毛泽东思想、毛主席最新指示，李二矿许多四、五十岁的工人家属自动组成了毛泽东思想宣传队。她们排除各种困难，经常到矿井、街头去进行宣传活动。当阶级敌人煽动一些工人停工停产的时候，这个家属宣传队就针锋相对地宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    有位黄大娘，解放前穷得连唯一的儿子都养不活，六岁给了人家，解放后才母子团聚。她听说在矿上做工的儿子不安心生产，就特地跟班下井边干活边给儿子讲家史，语重心长地说：
    “孩子，咱穷人跟着毛主席才翻了身，现在毛主席把江山放到你们身上，担子重呵！咱不能尝了甜头，忘了苦头！在一天就要为人民服务一天，毛主席指到那里就要打到那里。”
    工人们听了很感动，都说：“大娘说得对，咱们一定要听毛主席的话！”紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    在尖锐、复杂的阶级搏斗中，淮南革命群众树立了一个牢固的信念：“紧跟毛主席就是胜利！”“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做！”
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，淮南工人阶级闻风而动。在驻军帮助下，他们大办以“斗私，批修”为纲的毛泽东思想学习班，每个车间、每个作业班组，都成了“斗私，批修”的战场。在这场触及灵魂的斗争中，涌现了许多一心为公的先进人物。
    大通矿老工人李元广，在文化大革命中，始终听毛主席的话，坚守生产岗位。一天完成采煤任务后，很多人陆续走了。他掏出表看了看，离下班还差七分钟，心想：“走吧，反正任务完成了，很多人都走了！”这个念头一闪，他马上想到毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，攥紧拳头说：“不能走！”他擦了擦脸上的汗水，又继续出了三车煤，直到接班同志来了，才愉快地离去。七分钟是短暂的一瞬，三车煤炭也不算多，但是正如他自己所说的：“七分钟虽短，公和私的斗争却很不平常呵！”
    新庄孜矿建井工区工人张荣广，在党内一小撮走资派煽动工人离开工作岗位的时候，主动串连二十三个工人坚持八小时工作制。他们排除私心杂念，不怕讽刺，不怕打击，克服各种困难，坚持生产。
    淮南的工人阶级，就是这样以对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，作为大公的最高标准。他们每时每刻用毛主席的教导，对照检查自己的行动，当作自己的行动指南。他们把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，真正落实在自己的行动上，促使全矿煤炭产量节节上升。
