The General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at all levels of party committees and among the broad masses of cadres, soldiers, and revolutionary workers, has, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed. They have implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fully implemented Chairman Mao's "May 7" directive. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is surging forward, presenting an unprecedentedly good situation.

Over the past year, the broad masses of cadres, soldiers, and revolutionary workers in the General Logistics Department have, in fully implementing and carrying out Chairman Mao's "May 7" directive, enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have regarded studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their sacred duty, and regarded implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the concentrated embodiment of their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. From the headquarters to the platoons, from the workshops to the farms, from the construction sites to the classrooms, Chairman Mao's brilliant image is everywhere, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are everywhere, and songs praising Chairman Mao are sung by everyone. The engineering troops fighting in the high mountains and steep cliffs have erected Chairman Mao's portrait high on the rock walls, written Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cliffs, and hung self-made "quotation lamps" in the caves. The mountains are red, and every heart is forever turned towards the red sun. The motorized troops driving on the windy and snowy lines of the Sichuan-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways have turned every vehicle into a propaganda vehicle for Mao Zedong Thought, spreading it along the way. Mao Zedong Thought is transmitted over ten thousand miles. The comrades of the Sixth Company of a certain motorized unit, known as "the flying wheels crushing thousands of miles of snow, red flags planted throughout the mountains," say:

	"Standing on the Kunlun Mountains looking at Beijing, Chairman Mao and we are heart to heart. Though separated by thousands of mountains, we can see clearly; though separated by ten thousand rivers, we can hear truly."

	Chairman Mao's good soldier, Year Fourwang, rescued a train and was seriously injured. He forgot his father and mother, and his heart was filled only with Chairman Mao, most concentratedly and fully embodying the broad masses of logistics soldiers' unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao.

	"One must participate in the struggle to criticize bourgeois culture at all times." This is the great call issued by Chairman Mao in the "May 7" directive to the people and soldiers of the entire country. Over the past year, the broad masses of cadres, soldiers, and revolutionary workers in the General Logistics Department have actively participated in the class struggle. They have regarded each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a battle command, responding immediately and executing them resolutely. The troops stationed in sparsely populated highland outposts, the horse farms distributed in the grasslands of the country's borders, and the small teams guarding the deep mountains and steep cliffs have listened to Chairman Mao's latest instructions from the radio, copied them overnight, studied them seriously, spread them quickly, and executed them resolutely.

	The broad masses of cadres, soldiers, and revolutionary workers in the General Logistics Department have responded to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism in the great waves of class struggle. Taking Year Fourwang, Chairman Mao's good soldier, as an example, they have broken down selfishness and established public spirit, making a great revolution in the depths of their souls. In defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new generation of communists is rapidly growing. The logistics soldiers distributed throughout the country, with their hearts devoted to the motherland and their eyes on the world, have linked their ordinary work with defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the world revolution, seeking neither fame nor wealth, fearing neither hardship nor death. The engineering troops fighting in the high mountains and steep cliffs, though in the valleys, have their hearts turned towards Chairman Mao. They say: "Every shovel and pickaxe we use is aimed at China's Khrushchev, digging his grave for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries." The comrades raising military horses in the vast snowy grasslands have linked raising military horses with the world revolution, raising horses for the world revolution, fearing neither wind and snow nor severe cold, and trampling all great difficulties underfoot.

	Class struggle is a great classroom for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The party committees at all levels of the General Logistics Department particularly emphasize sending the troops to the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," experiencing storms and seeing the world. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the class struggle, building a great wall of "public spirit" in their minds, and tempering their red hearts for Chairman Mao even more fiercely. The comrades who have been guarding the windy and snowy highlands for many years and have been evaluated as "four goods" for six consecutive years at the Kaji La outpost have studied diligently and enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcoming the difficulties of wind, snow, and thin air, taking root in the highlands, and devoting their lives to the revolution, offering their lives to the ice mountains and snow peaks.

	Chairman Mao's latest instructions have armed the broad masses of logistics soldiers, turning into spiritual atomic bombs with boundless power. The ten martyrs, including Deputy Political Instructor Li Xianwen of a certain motorized regiment, executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness. To defend the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they bravely explored dangerous areas during a transportation mission and heroically sacrificed their lives in a rare mountain collapse. They realized their oath to "fight for the defense of Mao Zedong Thought in life and die for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" with their heroic actions, truly achieving "having only the red sun in their hearts, daring to go up even in the face of mountain collapses and earthquakes."

	"Seeing the rippling waves of rice and millet, heroes are everywhere at dusk." Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7" directive, the broad masses of cadres, soldiers, and revolutionary workers in the General Logistics Department have resolved, in the new year, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to better carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao himself, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to turn the General Logistics Department into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    一年多来，总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工在全面贯彻和落实毛主席的“五·七”指示中，大赞大颂伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示当作自己崇高的职责，把条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示当作无限忠于毛主席的集中体现。从机关到连队，从车间到农场，从工地到课堂，毛主席光辉形象处处见，毛主席最新指示处处有，毛主席的颂歌人人唱。奋战在崇山峻岭的工程部队，把毛主席像高高树立在石壁上，把毛主席的最新指示写在山崖上，把自制的“语录灯”挂在石洞里，山上山下一片红，颗颗红心永向红太阳。奔驰在川藏、青藏风雪线上的汽车部队，把每一台汽车都办成毛泽东思想的宣传车，走一路，宣传一路，毛泽东思想传万里。被誉为“飞轮碾碎千里雪，红旗插遍万重山”的汽车某部六连的同志们说：
  “站在昆仑望北京，毛主席和咱心贴心，虽隔千山看得清，虽隔万水听得真。”毛主席的好战士年四旺，抢救火车，英勇负伤后，忘了爹，忘了娘，心中只有毛主席，最集中、最充分地体现了广大后勤战士对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。
      “要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。”这是毛主席在“五·七”指示中向全国军民发出的伟大号召。一年多来，总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工，积极投入阶级斗争。他们把毛主席发出的每条最新指示，都当作一道战斗命令，闻风而动，坚决执行。战斗在人烟稀少的高原兵站，分布在祖国边疆草原的马场，坚守在深山峻岭执勤的小分队，从收音机里一听到毛主席的最新指示，就连夜抄收，认真学习，迅速传播，坚决照办。
    总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工在阶级斗争的大风大浪里响应毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的战斗号召，以毛主席的好战士年四旺为榜样，破私立公，在灵魂深处大闹革命。在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，一代共产主义新人正在迅速成长。分布在祖国天南海北的后勤战士，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，把平凡的工作和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和世界革命紧密地联系在一起，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死。战斗在崇山峻岭的工程部队，身在山沟，心向毛主席。他们说：“我们一锹一镐都是向中国赫鲁晓夫开火，都是为帝、修、反挖掘坟墓。”在茫茫风雪草原上养育军马的同志们，把养育军马同世界革命联系起来，为世界革命养马，风雪严寒都不怕，天大困难踩脚下。
    阶级斗争是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大课堂。总后勤部各级党委特别重视让部队到“三支”“两军”第一线，经风雨，见世面。广大指战员在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席最新指示，在头脑里筑起一道“公”字的长城，把忠于毛主席的红心炼得更红。长年坚守在风雪高原、连续六年被评为四好的卡集拉兵站的同志们，刻苦学习，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示，战胜了风雪严寒和空气稀薄等困难，扎根高原，一心一意为革命，冰山雪岭献终生。
    毛主席的最新指示武装了广大后勤战士，变成了威力无穷的精神原子弹。汽车某团副教导员李显文等十位烈士，执行毛主席抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备的最新指示，为了保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命，在一次执行运输任务中，深入险区探路，在罕见的大山崩中壮烈牺牲。他们以英勇行动实现了“生为捍卫毛泽东思想而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席革命路线而献身”的誓言，真正做到了“心中只有红太阳，山崩地裂也敢上”。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟”。在毛主席的“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工，决心在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为把总后勤部办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
