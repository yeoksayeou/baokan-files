The revolutionary peoples of the world, in the face of an unprecedented upsurge in the anti-imperialist struggle, are advancing with confidence and a fighting spirit into the radiant 1968, ready to welcome even greater victories. The American empire, however, which has been severely battered by the world revolutionary storm, is finding its days increasingly difficult, facing an even bleaker future. In the days leading up to and following the New Year, American and other Western bourgeois newspapers, in reflecting on the past and looking ahead, have adopted a low and despondent tone.

These newspapers lament that for the United States, 1967 was a "year not worth remembering," a "year of anxiety," and that 1968 began with a state of "unrest and chaos," facing "enormous domestic and foreign dangers." A year-end report by the United Press International somberly admitted that due to the United States being mired in unprecedented domestic and foreign difficulties in 1967, the New Year's holiday has become a "depressing day." Some newspapers even gloomily stated that the prospects for the United States today are "darker than they were twenty years ago."

The U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam suffered even greater defeats in 1967. The heroic Vietnamese people have beaten the U.S. imperialists into a state of disarray and desperation on the battlefield, and their "peace talks" schemes have repeatedly failed. Western newspapers acknowledge that the "Vietnam problem" is the most painful legacy of the past year and the most difficult and dangerous challenge of the coming year. They lament that Johnson is already in a "mess" over the Vietnam issue and is "in a situation from which he cannot extricate himself."

One direct consequence of the war in Vietnam is that U.S. imperialism's limited financial resources have been drained to an extremely precarious level, making the already fragile U.S. financial and economic situation even more dire. The International Herald Tribune, in the days leading up to the New Year, discussed Johnson's financial difficulties, saying that due to the inability to balance the 1968 budget, Johnson's end-of-year situation is quite embarrassing. On New Year's Day, Johnson hastily announced five "emergency measures" in an attempt to salvage the dollar crisis, which caused a wave of panic in the United States and the capitalist world. American newspapers had to admit that Johnson's measures are a "bitter pill" for the presidential election year and a "sinister beginning" to the new year. Some newspapers pointed out that Johnson's "emergency measures" have had a "dark influence" not only economically but also politically.

The U.S. ruling class and the press, in looking ahead to 1968, expressed unease and fear about the armed anti-violence struggles and anti-war movements that the American people launched in 1967. The U.S. News & World Report exclaimed that the black anti-violence struggle is developing into an "open rebellion against the government." Some newspapers acknowledged that the anti-draft movement among American youth in the past year was "stronger than at any time in more than a hundred years." They worriedly pointed out: the United States is now in a "time of turmoil," and the revolutionary flames burning around the world have "already reached the United States."

In this situation of internal and external difficulties and desperation, Western newspapers, in discussing the U.S. elections this year, pointed out that neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party has any solutions to get the United States out of its current predicament; whoever comes to power, "things will not be easy." These newspapers lamented that the future of the U.S. president is bleak, but "the future of the United States is even bleaker than the future of its president."

    回顾过去凄凉沮丧  瞻望未来黯淡无光
    美国报刊哀叹美帝日子空前难熬
    承认约翰逊的“紧急措施”是“新的一年的一个不祥的开端”
    新华社讯　全世界革命人民在反帝斗争空前高涨的大好形势下，正满怀信心地以战斗的姿态向光辉灿烂的一九六八年迈进，去迎接更加伟大的胜利，而遭到世界革命风暴猛烈打击的美帝国主义，日子空前难熬，面临着一片更加黯淡的前景。新年前后，美国和其它西方资产阶级报刊在回顾过去，瞻望前景时，语调低沉、情绪沮丧。
    这些报刊哀叹，对于美国说来，一九六七年是“不值得怀念的一年”，是“令人焦虑的一年”，而一九六八年一开始，就处于“不安和混乱”的困境，“面临着巨大的国内外危险”。美国合众国际社发出的一则年终报道悲观地承认，由于美国在一九六七年深陷在空前严重的国内外困境中，因此，使得一九六八年的新年假日成了一个“令人沮丧的日子”。有的报刊甚至阴郁地说，美国“今天面临的前景比二十年前更加阴暗”。
    美帝国主义的侵越战争在一九六七年遭到了更大的惨败。美帝国主义在越南战场上被英雄的越南人民打得狼狈不堪、走投无路，它的“和谈”阴谋也连续遭到破产。西方报刊承认，“越南问题是过去一年中最痛苦的遗产，是未来一年里最困难、最危险的挑战”。它们哀叹约翰逊在越南问题上已经“弄得不可开交”，“正陷入无法摆脱的处境”。
    侵越战争的直接后果之一，是把美帝国主义有限的财力消耗到了十分窘迫的程度，使本来就已经千疮百孔的美国财政经济更加急剧恶化。美国《国际先驱论坛报》在新年前夕谈到约翰逊所面临的财经困难时说，由于无法平衡一九六八年的预算，约翰逊的年关处境十分狼狈。就在元旦这一天，约翰逊匆匆忙忙宣布了妄图挽救美元危局的五项“紧急措施”，这在美国国内和资本主义世界引起了一片惊惶。美国报刊不得不承认，约翰逊的这些措施是今年总统选举年中的一丸“苦药”，是“新的一年的一个不祥的开端”。有的报纸指出，约翰逊的“紧急措施”不仅在经济上，而且在政治上也产生了“阴暗的影响”。
    美国统治集团和报刊在瞻望一九六八年的前景时，对于美国人民在一九六七年中所掀起的如火如荼的黑人武装抗暴斗争和反对侵越战争的斗争，普遍流露出不安和惊恐。《美国新闻与世界报道》惊呼，黑人抗暴斗争正在发展成为“反对政府的公开叛乱”。一些报纸承认，去年美国青年反对征兵的运动比一百多年来“任何时候都更强大”。它们忧心忡忡地指出：美国现在处在“动乱的时代”，烧遍世界的革命烈火“已经烧到了美国”。
    在这种内外交困、走投无路的情况下，西方报刊在谈到美国今年的大选时指出，无论是民主党或是共和党都拿不出什么办法使美国摆脱目前的窘境；无论谁上台，“日子都不会好过”。这些报刊哀叹美国总统的“前途”是黯淡的，但是，“美国的前途比它的总统的前途更加黯淡”。
