One evening, the head of the first production brigade, Xu Youlan, gathered his family, three generations, for a family criticism session to criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Fight to the End with Class Enemies

Xu Youlan said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist society is a rather long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." The Chinese Khrushchev, in opposition to Chairman Mao, falsely claims that "landlords and rich peasants will all enter socialism," and that "class struggle has ended." This is all deceitful nonsense. From liberation until now, has there been a day when class struggle has stopped?

The landlords and rich peasants are still around, their hearts are not dead, and they are always plotting to stage a comeback. In our brigade, there is a landlord who, after liberation, always pretended to be sick, lying in bed, and wrote counter-revolutionary accounts for over ten years. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we seized them. At the same time, we also seized the bayonets and machetes that two counter-revolutionaries planned to use to kill our cadres and activists who study Chairman Mao's works. The enemy is so audacious, is this not proof that "class struggle has ended"?

A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are our most dangerous enemies. They fiercely oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose socialism. We, the people of Hongjin, use Chairman Mao's works extensively, and they fiercely oppose this, attempting to block the poor and lower-middle peasants from grasping and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Is this not also proof that "class struggle has ended"?

The Chinese Khrushchev falsely claims that "class struggle has ended," clearly speaking on behalf of the landlords and rich peasants. This in itself is class struggle. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," fight to the end with class enemies, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Fight to the End with the "Private" in Our Minds

Zhu Fengying (Xu Youlan's wife) said: We still have class enemies in our minds. This enemy is the "private" ideology left over from the old society. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and every kind of thought is stamped with the mark of class." If we do not overthrow the "private" in our minds, the revolution cannot be carried out well. In the past, I did not care about the collective, worked only for work points, and did not care about quality. I saw Youlan become a cadre, busy from day to night, doing less housework, and thought I was at a disadvantage, wanting to drag him back. This is class struggle in the mind. We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, overthrow the "private," let the "public" settle down, and wholeheartedly carry out the revolution.

Zhou Xiubao (Xu Youlan's mother) encouraged her descendants: You all must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and grasp the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The fifteen-year-old eldest daughter, Guihua, said: We were born under the red flag and grew up in sweet water, not knowing the hardships the older generation endured. Tonight's criticism session made me hate the Chinese Khrushchev to the core. I will surely criticize him thoroughly and resolutely follow Chairman Mao to carry out the revolution.

The eleven-year-old younger son, Binghua, and the thirteen-year-old younger daughter, Xuehua, also said: Although we are young, there is still a lot of "private" in our minds. We do not want to eat slightly worse food or wear slightly worn clothes, insisting on eating well and dressing well. This is the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must "study hard every day and make progress," listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be good children of Chairman Mao.

### 千万不要忘记阶级斗争——徐友兰祖孙三代批判“阶级斗争熄灭论”

    千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    ——徐友兰祖孙三代批判“阶级斗争熄灭论”
    一天晚上，第一生产队队长徐友兰一家，祖孙三代聚集一堂，开了一个家庭批判会，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    同阶级敌人斗到底
    徐友兰说：毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”中国赫鲁晓夫同毛主席唱对台戏，胡说什么“地主、富农都将进入社会主义”，“阶级斗争已经结束了”，这完全是骗人的鬼话。解放到现在，那一天停止过阶级斗争？
    地主富农人还在，心不死，时时刻刻想反攻复辟。我们大队里有个地主，解放后一直装生病，躺在床上，写了十几年的变天账，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，给我们抄了出来。同时，我们还抄出了两个反革命分子妄图用来杀害我们干部和学习毛主席著作积极分子的刺刀和砍刀。敌人这样猖狂，难道是“阶级斗争已经结束了”吗？
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是我们最危险的敌人。他们拚命反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对社会主义。我们洪泾大学大用毛主席著作，他们就拚命反对，妄图阻挡贫下中农掌握和运用毛泽东思想。这难道也是“阶级斗争已经结束了”吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说“阶级斗争已经结束了”，明明是替地主富农说话，这本身就是阶级斗争。我们要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，同阶级敌人斗到底，保卫无产阶级专政。
    同头脑里的“私”字斗到底
    朱凤英（徐友兰的爱人）说：我们头脑里还有阶级敌人。这个敌人就是旧社会留下来的“私”字。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”我们头脑里的“私”字不斗倒，革命就搞不好。以前我不关心集体，干活只图工分，不管质量。我看到友兰当了干部，一日到夜忙五忙六，家务做得少，就认为吃了亏，要拖后腿。这就是头脑里的阶级斗争。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，斗倒“私”字，让“公”字安家落户，一心一意干革命。
    周秀宝（徐友兰的母亲）鼓励儿孙们说：你们要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，为贫下中农掌牢印把子。
    十五岁的大女儿桂华说：我们生在红旗下，长在甜水里，不晓得老一辈吃过的苦，今晚开了批判会，我恨透了中国赫鲁晓夫，一定要把他批透批臭，坚决紧跟毛主席干革命。
    十一岁的小儿子炳华和十三岁的小女儿雪华也说：我们年纪虽小，但头脑里的“私”字不少，差一点的饭不想吃，破一点的衣裳不想穿，独要吃好穿好，这是受了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害。我们一定要“好好学习，天天向上”，听毛主席话，做毛主席的好孩子。
