The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our school is excellent. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres are united, full of vigor, and determined to redouble their efforts in the new year to strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

In the past, due to the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the two revolutionary mass organizations in our school waged a "civil war" that lasted for half a year, and both sides were extremely hostile towards each other.

Looking at the current situation and reflecting on the past, the fundamental reason for the current good situation is the result of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directive: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," it is the result of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism," and it is the result of continuously overcoming factionalism and strengthening party spirit.

	Organizing large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the fundamental way to overcome factionalism and strengthen party spirit

The broad masses of the two revolutionary mass organizations in our school had the desire to unite as early as last March. However, due to the dominance of "self-interest," and the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the issue of revolutionary great alliance was discussed for more than a month, with both sides insisting on their own views and neither side yielding.

At this time, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Revolutionary Committee organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and our school's two revolutionary organizations also sent representatives to participate. Later, the two factions finally united for the first time to organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

At the beginning, the two factions had deep-seated prejudices and ignored each other. Later, everyone studied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" together, especially repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and a new situation emerged. Everyone deeply criticized their selfish thoughts and exposed the heinous crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Many students had deep feelings and said: "Factionalism is a troublemaker, harming others, harming oneself, and harming the revolution," "Factionalism blinds one's mind, leading to foolish acts that cause pain to friends and joy to enemies, treating comrades as enemies, and ignoring the real enemies." The more everyone talked about the harm of factionalism, the stronger the desire for unity became. Chairman Mao's instructions enlightened everyone, and the broad revolutionary cadres enthusiastically put up large banners: "Do not be a stumbling block to the great alliance, but be a paving stone for the great alliance." Under the strong east wind of the revolutionary great alliance in September last year, the two factions achieved revolutionary great unity. Teachers and students excitedly said: "It is Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts that have united the two factions in our school."

	The masses urge the leaders, the leaders lead the masses, and they promote each other to overcome factionalism

Overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a key issue for revolutionary mass organizations.

In mid-September last year, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were passed down, and the campus immediately became lively. The broad revolutionary cadres eagerly demanded rapid unity. Under the supervision of the revolutionary masses, the leaders of the two factions immediately held an emergency meeting to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and unanimously recognized that: following or not following Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the dividing line and touchstone between revolution and non-revolution. A true revolutionary fighter should unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The leaders said: "The masses elected us not to wage 'civil war,' but to lead the revolutionary ranks forward according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. If we cannot play the role of a 'locomotive,' we will disappoint the broad masses of fighters."

The leaders fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and in turn inspired the masses.

	Starting from class analysis, recognizing the harm of factionalism, and consciously overcoming factionalism

In the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, it is necessary to recognize the harm of factionalism. Many revolutionary teachers and students, after summarizing the painful lessons of the half-year "civil war," said: "Waging 'civil war' is waging private war, helping the enemy to fight against ourselves."

In the past, we did not effectively struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and one of the important reasons was that we did not clearly understand where factionalism comes from. We thought that "everyone has factionalism, which is inevitable," and did not recognize the problem from the line struggle. Tracing the roots, the division of revolutionary teachers and students into two factions was the result of the evil consequences of the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Our revolutionary teachers and students said well: "The enemy is most pleased with our factionalism, but we will not indulge in it, we will consciously overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and oppose it head-on. Whatever the enemy supports, we will resolutely oppose."

In the disputes caused by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, most are internal contradictions among the people. Among revolutionary comrades, factionalism is produced due to the corruption of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology and should be handled strictly according to the method of correctly handling internal contradictions among the people. Our school's Mao Zedong Thought small team is composed of members from the original two factions. At the beginning of the unity, they were still superficially united but inwardly divided. Later, they handled internal factionalism according to the principle of correctly handling internal contradictions among the people, and achieved good results.

At the same time, it must be seen that the enemy will also eagerly incite factional disputes among revolutionary mass organizations. Places with factionalism are where class enemies can most easily hide, and they are places where they can most easily carry out sabotage activities. The sabotage they cause through inciting factionalism can achieve effects that they themselves cannot achieve. For the enemy's sabotage activities, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to expose the bad guys both in front of and behind the scenes and implement proletarian dictatorship. During our school's "civil war," the two factions of teachers and students had very strong hostile emotions. Although they had several discussions, they did not achieve great unity. Later, they mobilized the masses, and one faction organization cleaned out a spy who had infiltrated the rebel faction, incited factionalism, and created factionalism. In this way, the great unity of the two factions quickly progressed. We realized that when the two factions have not united, and there are bad guys inciting from within, it is necessary for each faction to mobilize the masses to clean out the bad guys within their own organization. This can avoid factional disputes, avoid giving the enemy an opportunity, and accelerate the unity of the factions.

    我们是怎样同派性不断作斗争的？
    上海轻工业学校革命委员会
    当前，我校的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好。全校广大无产阶级革命派团结一致，朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬，决心在新的一年里，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
    过去，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，我校两大革命群众组织打了长达半年之久的“内战”，双方情绪十分对立。
    看看现在，想想过去，当前所以有这样好的新气象，其根本原因，是坚决执行毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”这一指示的结果，是“斗私，批修”的结果，是不断克服派性，增强党性的结果。
      大办毛泽东思想学习班，是打倒派性增强党性的根本途径
    我校两大革命群众组织的广大战士，早在去年三月就有了联合的愿望。但是，由于“私”字当头，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，因此，在革命大联合的问题上，商谈了一个多月，双方各执一词，互不相让。
    这时，上海市教育局革命委员会举办了毛泽东思想学习班，我校两大革命组织也都派代表前去参加。后来，两大派终于第一次联合起来举办毛泽东思想学习班。
    开始，两派隔阂很深，互不理睬。后来，大家一块学习“老三篇”，特别是反复学习毛主席的最新指示，就出现了新局面。大家狠挖私心，清算资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的滔天罪行。不少同学都深有体会地说：“派性是害人精，害人，害己，害革命”，“派性蒙住了心窍，就会作出亲者痛，仇者快的蠢事，把同志当作敌人，把真正的敌人放在一边。”大家越谈派性的危害性，要求联合的愿望越强烈。毛主席的指示，擦亮了大家的眼睛，广大革命派战士纷纷贴出了大幅标语：“不做大联合的绊脚石，要做大联合的铺路石”。在去年九月革命大联合高潮的强劲东风下，两派实现了革命的大联合。师生们激动地说：“是毛主席他老人家的光辉思想，把我校两大派联合起来了。”
      群众促头头，头头带群众，互相促进，打倒派性
    克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，革命群众组织的头头是一个关键。
    在去年九月中，毛主席的最新指示传下来，校园内顿时沸腾起来。广大革命派战士纷纷要求迅速联合起来。在革命群众的监督下，两派负责人马上召开紧急会议，学习毛主席的最新指示，一致认识到：紧跟不紧跟毛主席的最新指示，是区别革命与不革命的分水岭和试金石，真正的革命战士就应该不折不扣地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。头头们说：“群众把我们选出来，不是叫我们打‘内战’，而是要我们按照毛主席指引的航向，带领革命队伍前进。我们如果起不到这样一个‘火车头’作用，就辜负了广大战士的希望。”
    头头斗了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，反过来又带动了群众。
      从阶级分析入手，认识派性的危害，自觉地打倒派性
    同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争，就必须认识派性的危害性。许多革命师生在总结了半年“内战”的沉痛教训之后说：“打‘内战’，就是打私战，就是帮敌人打自己人。”
    过去，我们对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性没有很好地展开斗争，其重要原因之一就是对派性从何而来，认识不清。以为“派性人人皆有，在所难免”，没有从两条路线斗争这个纲上来认识问题。追根溯源，革命师生内部分裂成两派，是中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线所造成的恶果。我校革命师生说得好：“敌人最高兴我们闹派性，我们就偏不闹，就偏要克服派性，增强党性，与它针锋相对。凡是敌人拥护的，我们就坚决反对。”
    在闹资产阶级、小资产阶级派性纠纷中，大量是人民内部矛盾。在革命同志之间，由于受到资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的腐蚀而产生了派性，都应当严格按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法来处理。我校毛泽东思想小分队，是由原来两派组织的成员组成的。在刚联合时，还是貌合神离。后来按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则来处理内部的派性，收到了良好的效果。
    同时必须看到，敌人也会起劲地在革命群众组织之间煽动派性纠纷。闹派性的地方，是阶级敌人最容易藏身的地方，是他们最容易从事破坏活动的场所。他们通过挑动派性而造成的破坏，能起到他们自己所起不到的作用。对于阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，就应当放手发动群众，把幕前幕后的坏人揪出来，对他们实行无产阶级专政。我校“内战”期间，两派教工对立情绪很厉害。虽也进行过多次商谈，但都未能实现大联合。后来发动了群众，一派组织在自己的队伍中清洗了一个钻进造反派队伍，进行挑拨离间，制造派性的特务分子。这样，两派组织的大联合就很快得到进展。我们体会到，当两派组织未联合起来，而又有坏人从中挑动时，由各派自己去发动群众，清洗混入自己组织中的坏人，这样既能避免派性纠纷，避免给敌人以可乘之机，又能加速各派联合。
