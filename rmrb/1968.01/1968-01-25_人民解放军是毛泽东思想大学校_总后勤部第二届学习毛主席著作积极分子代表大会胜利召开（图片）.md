— The Second Session of the Total Logistics Department's Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Convened Successfully

Leaders such as Zhang Huizuo, the Director of the Total Logistics Department, and Zhang Chuming, the Political Commissar, visited the representatives from various parts of the country to encourage the logistics soldiers to better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, and to make the Total Logistics Department and its affiliated units into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The working class is a model in executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary masses of the Three-Five-One-Six Factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implemented and carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving a double harvest in revolution and production. They solemnly swear to Chairman Mao, the great leader: "We will forever be the vanguard of the revolution and the model of production."

“Mao Zedong Thought has great power, nurturing soldiers to be revolutionary; facing storms and waves, daring to cross mountains of knives and seas of fire.” When a severe flood threatened national defense construction, the comrades of the Engineering Construction Brigade used Mao Zedong Thought to direct the flood control battle, ensuring the smooth progress of the construction. In this struggle, seven people were awarded first-class merit citations, and four people sacrificed their lives. This is the brigade's soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works on the construction site.

“Mao Zedong Thought is my life; I do as Chairman Mao says.” The platoon leader of the Sixth Platoon in a certain unit of the Total Logistics Department, known as a "good example of eliminating selfishness and establishing the public," propagated Mao Zedong Thought during the support-left activities, promoting the revolutionary great alliance of revolutionary mass organizations. The masses praised him as a "red propagandist on the support-left front." This is him sharing his insights on studying the "Three Articles" with the Red Guards.

“The flying wheel crushes thousands of miles of snow, and the red flag is planted on ten thousand mountains.” The comrades of the Sixth Platoon in a certain motorized brigade of the Total Logistics Department, who have been traveling on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for years, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, learning as they go, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought for thousands of miles. This is them studying during their journey.

The Party Committee of a certain unit in the Total Logistics Department firmly supports the revolutionary leftist masses, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. People praise them as a "red flag supporting the left on the banks of the Yellow River." This is the soldiers enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses.

“Study Chairman Mao's works without relaxing for a moment; execute Chairman Mao's instructions without deviating by a hair; propagate Mao Zedong Thought without stopping for a moment; defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line without wavering for a lifetime.” This is the comrades of the Service Company in the 30th Battalion of a certain unit in the Total Logistics Department, propagating Mao Zedong Thought while marching.

“Carrying the treasure book and studying it every day, riding the horse and using it everywhere.” A red flag flying under the Qilian Mountains on the logistics horse line—a certain horse farm's Third Team—responds to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, arms the mind with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely resists the bourgeois military line of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, and wholeheartedly raises good military horses for the revolution.
