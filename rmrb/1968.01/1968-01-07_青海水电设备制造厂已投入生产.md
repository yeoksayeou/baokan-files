The Qinghai Hydropower Equipment Manufacturing Plant, which was established during the initial phase of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has now started producing hydroelectric equipment for rural areas.

The first 12-kilowatt micro hydroelectric generator set produced by the plant has been safely operating in Hejia Village, Qingshan Commune, Datong County. This has enabled the villagers to use electric lights and electric-powered milling machines, grinding mills, and oil presses. The villagers enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand long lives!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The Qinghai Hydropower Equipment Manufacturing Plant is dedicated to serving the electrification of mountain villages. Based on the characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where water flow is abundant, the water drop is significant, and hydroelectric resources are rich, the plant primarily produces micro hydroelectric equipment.

    青海水电设备制造厂已投入生产
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期筹建的青海水电设备制造厂，现在已经开始为农村生产水电设备。
    这个厂制造的第一台十二瓩微型整装水轮发电机组，已经在大通县青山公社贺家庄大队安全运行，使这个山庄的社员用上了电灯和电动碾场机、磨面机、榨油机。社员们激动地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    青海水电设备制造厂是为山村实现电气化服务的。它根据青海高原农村水流多、落差大、水力资源丰富的特点，以生产微型水力发电设备为主。
