The sky may be high, but it is not as high as Chairman Mao's genius. The Milky Way may be long, but it is not as long as Chairman Mao's kindness. The stars may be numerous, but they are not as numerous as Chairman Mao's contributions to the people. The ocean may be deep, but it is not as deep as our love for Chairman Mao. The soldiers and revolutionary masses of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xingtai region, with boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao, joyfully gaze upon the great leader Chairman Mao.

"Respected Leader Chairman Mao, we are forever loyal to you!" The representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, Air Force, and the Second Artillery Corps of the People's Liberation Army have seen the great leader Chairman Mao. They have condensed their boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao into the most beautiful language, shouting enthusiastically for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

The family study groups in Liujiahe Village love reading Chairman Mao's books the most. They bring questions about how to thoroughly criticize and repudiate China's Khrushchev and how to criticize and repudiate private interests and establish public interests. They actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. This is the community member Bai Keting's family studying Chairman Mao's quotations before a family criticism meeting.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Henan places the propagation and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the first position during the "three supports and two militaries" work. They have formed many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, deeply entering factories and rural areas, enthusiastically carrying out various forms of propaganda activities. The broad masses of officers and soldiers are determined to launch a larger-scale movement of learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought together with the revolutionary people of Henan, making the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky over Zhongyuan. This is the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit stationed in Zhengzhou propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the peasants. Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter.

The revolutionary workers of Class B in the Fourth Workshop of Lanzhou First Woolen Textile Mill, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, have set up large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, extensively studying and applying the "Old Five Articles," powerfully promoting the thought revolution of people, making both revolution and production present a lively scene. This is a revolutionary worker participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class studying Chairman Mao's quotations. Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter.

The supporting-left soldiers have brought the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to Lingshou Middle School in Liaoning, greatly promoting the thought revolution of people. Originally, due to different understandings, the students Cui Shuzhen (left) and Zhang Lixiu formed two factions. Through self-criticism and mutual exchange of hearts, they have become a pair of reds. This is them studying Chairman Mao's works together. Contributed by Lingshou County Military Affairs Department.

Bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the masses is the greatest love for the people. The broad masses of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Air Force stationed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to Tibetan compatriots on the agricultural front. This is nurse Han Dangying studying Chairman Mao's works with an old Tibetan woman. Photographed by Tao Guangming.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured our growth. We are Chairman Mao's little red guards. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and forever propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of little red guards in the capital (the youngest is only five years old) performing for the masses and propagating Mao Zedong Thought.
