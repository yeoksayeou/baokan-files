The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power.” In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after the proletarian revolutionary masses seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the most fundamental task is to be like Li Wenzhong, an outstanding representative of advanced elements of the proletariat in continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, to be endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, to take “struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism” as the key link, to thoroughly smash bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, to fundamentally transform our worldview, and to firmly establish the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in people’s minds, especially in the minds of leading cadres at all levels. Only in this way can we ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

Never Forget the Struggle for Power in the Mind

Chairman Mao says: “To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, one must first do work in the ideological sphere. Revolutionary classes are like this, and counter-revolutionary classes are also like this.” To establish, maintain, consolidate, and develop a political power, one must first do work in the ideological sphere. The white power of the exploiting classes is built on the basis of the bourgeois “self,” and it is consolidated in the ideological sphere by the “self” in people’s minds; the red power of the proletariat is built on the basis of the proletarian “public,” and it is consolidated by the “public” in people’s minds. If the “public” is not firmly established in our minds, the red power will not be solid even if it is established. To consolidate and develop the red power, we must pay thousands of times more attention to the struggle for power in the mind. If Mao Zedong Thought does not take root in our minds and the “self” drives out the “public,” the red power we have established with our blood and sweat will change color, and capitalism will be restored.

Chairman Mao says: “The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere is a long, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce struggle.” In the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, domestic and foreign class enemies will not resign themselves to defeat and will inevitably adopt more cunning and covert means to continue their struggle against us. One of their plots is to place their hope for the restoration of capitalism in China on the “self” in the minds of our proletarian revolutionary masses. Therefore, the class struggle between the “public” and the “self” in the ideological sphere has become more complex and acute. They use various plots to attack us, attempting to incite the “self” in our minds to seize the power of the “public,” so as to collaborate from within and overthrow our red power.

“If the ‘self’ does not fall, the country will not be secure.” Revolutionary cadres must not relax the struggle against the “self” and relax ideological remolding; otherwise, they will gradually deviate from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary path and turn to the opposite side. Among the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who have been overthrown, some were originally traitors, spies, and agents of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. But some were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy. We should take this as a lesson and always be vigilant.

Comrade Li Wenzhong said well: “If we do not seize the power of the ‘self’ in our minds, we cannot become proletarian revolutionaries, we cannot accomplish the tasks given to us by the people of our motherland, and we may not even pass the test of socialism.” We must learn from Comrade Li Wenzhong, always use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, take “struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism” as the key link, grasp our own ideological transformation, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and make the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds more consolidated and developed.

Establish the Dominant Position of Great Mao Zedong Thought in the Mind

A ship navigates the sea with a helmsman; to make a revolution, we need Mao Zedong Thought. Without the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the brilliant guidance of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, there would be nothing for the proletariat and the laboring people. To break down selfishness and establish the public in our minds, we must firmly establish our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establish the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. We must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, be endlessly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have unlimited trust in the wise and correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry out every instruction of Chairman Mao. We must be loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Just as Comrade Li Wenzhong said: “Cutting off the head is nothing; as long as the principle is true; to defend Chairman Mao, even death is worthwhile.” Our red power should forever be in the hands of those who are endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Only by being endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and establishing the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds can we have true revolutionary leadership. The facts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tell us: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the proletarian dictatorship. The instructions of Chairman Mao are the guiding principles for all work of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole country. Every revolutionary action of hundreds of millions of people is directly commanded by Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever is endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, endlessly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, endlessly loyal to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and in practice holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and resolutely carries out the instructions of Chairman Mao, will be trusted and supported by the masses and have proletarian leadership authority; conversely, whoever is not loyal to Chairman Mao and does not hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will be despised by the masses.

Our personal abilities are limited, and whatever we can do for the people is entirely thanks to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and the wisdom and strength of the masses. When encountering problems, we should often consult Chairman Mao, often consult superiors, and often discuss with the masses, and not be self-righteous. This is the most important guarantee for us to do our work well. When we seriously study and understand the instructions of Chairman Mao, we feel that we stand high, see far, have a red heart and bright eyes, speak with principles, and act with methods, and the masses approve, and work can achieve results. When we do not study and understand the instructions of Chairman Mao enough, it is like lacking a mainstay, and selfish thoughts increase, speech is not effective, actions are not successful, and it is difficult to take a step, and it is easy to deviate from the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and cause damage to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, we must only be endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao closely, study Chairman Mao’s works diligently, study the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, and strive to work on the “use” aspect, truly turning Mao Zedong Thought into our central nervous system, making Mao Zedong Thought forever hold power in our minds, so as to hold power well for the people and use power well for the people. No matter how busy we are, we must always put the study and application of Chairman Mao’s works in the first place and never forget; no matter how things change, we must always keep the system of reading Chairman Mao’s works every day unchanged. Among many things, we must first grasp the big issue of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works.

With the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a Weapon, Launch an Offensive Against the “Self” in the Mind

To be endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and consolidate and develop the dominant position of the “public” in the mind, we must engage in a life-and-death struggle with the “self” in our minds. Chairman Mao says: “Regarding the backward things in the minds of the Chinese people, we must eliminate them, just like using a broom to sweep a room. There has never been any dust that automatically disappears without being swept away.” We must use Mao Zedong Thought as an iron broom to sweep our minds thoroughly, driving out the filthy and stinking “self” and implementing ruthless dictatorship over it with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

To strike the snake at its vital point, we must struggle against selfishness at the crucial point. To struggle against selfishness, we must grasp the big principles. The attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao is the highest principle. Currently, within our revolutionary ranks, some comrades have serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They do not resolutely carry out the instructions of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, but adopt a selfish and utilitarian attitude, supporting and carrying out what is in line with personal and small group interests, and passively resisting and discounting what is not. This is disloyalty to the big principles. This is the biggest selfishness. Therefore, the production of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is because the “self” is at work in the mind. We must ruthlessly criticize and struggle against the “self,” struggle out a red heart that is endlessly loving, believing, admiring, and loyal to Chairman Mao. Truly, like the great communist warrior Li Wenzhong: “If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I carry it out; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance.”

In the struggle against selfishness on big principles, we must be like Comrade Li Wenzhong, launch an offensive, and as soon as we discover the “self,” we must actively attack, repeatedly charge, and not give it a foothold, so as to ensure the dominant position of the “public” in the mind. Launching an offensive means to have the spirit of seizing the day, daring to struggle with the spirit of self-criticism, daring to struggle with the spirit of thoroughness, and daring to struggle with the spirit of continuous revolution.

Dare to struggle with the spirit of seizing the day. To make a revolution, we must fight for every second, which is a prominent characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary masses. To struggle against the “self” in our minds, we must also fight for every second, especially for comrades in leading positions. If a thought of “self” appears in the mind, it may greatly interfere with the implementation of the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and cause great damage to the revolution. To struggle against selfishness, we must not wait until problems arise to struggle, but must actively seize the opportunity, track and strike, and ruthlessly struggle against the “self” as soon as it appears, not allowing selfish thoughts to slip by. With the spirit of seizing the day, as soon as the “self” causes trouble, we must seize it and not let it go, using the “Three Articles” as a weapon to immediately eliminate it. The responsible comrades of the “Provincial Revolutionary Committee” and other organizations, in order to implement the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, led the way in struggling against selfishness with the spirit of seizing the day, overcoming factionalism, and promoting revolutionary great unity. The masses said well: “Leaders struggle against selfishness with the spirit of seizing the day, and the strategic deployment of Chairman Mao is unimpeded.” This is a valuable experience.

Dare to struggle with the spirit of self-criticism. Within the people, among revolutionary masses, can we or cannot we, according to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, with the great bosom of a communist, unite all those who can be united to jointly make a revolution, the key is whether we can be strict with ourselves and ruthlessly struggle against the “self” in our minds. Those who have the “self” in a dominant position in their minds always are lenient with themselves and strict with others. They speak ill of others and regard themselves as perfect. They think they are the only ones who are left, the only ones who make a revolution, and the only ones who are good. Chairman Mao teaches us: “Do not always think you are right, as if truth is in your hands. Do not always think only you are capable, and others are not, as if the world would not turn without you.” “We must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and be rich in the spirit of self-criticism.” Being strict with oneself means making self-criticism. Not only should we have the desire to welcome others to “point out faults,” but we should also have the style of “self-exposure” and dare to “expose our shortcomings.” We should often actively expose our selfish thoughts to the masses, expose our “sores,” and set up “targets,” and expose the “self” hidden deep in the soul to “public display,” making it a rat crossing the street, and mobilizing everyone to annihilate it. Some factories initially did not do a good job of revolutionary great unity. With the help of the propaganda teams of the People’s Liberation Army, the responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations used the spirit of self-criticism to make self-criticisms, with the bosom of liberating all mankind, with deep class feelings, abandoning personal grudges, and helping the deceived masses to return to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao with extreme enthusiasm and sincerity, achieving revolutionary great unity.

Dare to struggle with the spirit of thoroughness. This means to sweep the “self” off the stage in the depths of the soul, uproot the “self,” destroy the “self’s” nest, and launch an annihilation battle, not leaving a single tail. When the proletarian revolutionary masses were in a very difficult situation under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, did we hesitate and compromise, or dare to take risks and resolutely support? We brought this question to the study of the “Three Articles,” eliminated all selfish thoughts, and decided to defend the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao to the death, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, breathing together, and sharing the same fate.

Dare to struggle with the spirit of continuous revolution. We must struggle at all times, in all things, in all places, repeatedly, and forever. At the moment when the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao achieved decisive victory in Zhejiang, amid the slogans of “study” and “salute” and the warm applause, we and the leaders of the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, together reviewed Chairman Mao’s report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. “We must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle.” Chairman Mao’s teachings made us feel particularly close. We deeply understood: as long as there are classes and class struggles in the world, the struggle between the “public” and the “self” in our minds will never stop. To struggle against selfishness, there can be no holidays. As long as you relax a little, the “self” will turn into arrogance, conceit, vanity, and indulgence, stirring up waves and counterattacking. Chairman Mao warns us: The current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and in the future, it will inevitably be carried out many times. We want to be proletarian revolutionaries who follow Chairman Mao’s revolution to the end, we must continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to ruthlessly implement dictatorship over the “self” in our minds, making Mao Zedong Thought forever hold the dominant position in our minds.

Go to the Great Storms and Waves of Mass Struggles to Study and Temper

“Successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in mass struggles and grow in the tempering of great storms and waves of revolution.” After more than a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we reviewed Chairman Mao’s great teachings and felt particularly close. Countless facts, especially the growth path of Comrade Li Wenzhong, once again proved to us: the great storms and waves of mass struggles are the best classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and the best battlefields for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

To go to the great storms and waves of mass struggles to study and temper, or to detach from mass struggles and cultivate oneself in seclusion? This is a big question of whether one is truly revolutionary and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: To judge whether a person is a false Marxist or a true Marxist, we only need to look at how he relates to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and it will be completely clear. To go to mass struggles to study and temper is just as Comrade Li Wenzhong said: “Rely on the strength of the masses to wage ‘people’s war’.” As soon as the “self” appears, it will be submerged in the vast ocean and have no place to hide, and the more one tempers, the redder one becomes; to cultivate oneself in seclusion, to be good to oneself, is for oneself, relying on oneself, completely cut off from mass struggles, and every day with an “I” “shadowing” oneself, one can only become more selfish, following the black road of “Cultivation,” and falling into the abyss of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

To better temper oneself in mass struggles, one must continuously enhance the awareness of being a small student of the masses. We must repeatedly study Chairman Mao’s teachings on “the masses are the real heroes,” “in a certain sense, the most intelligent, the most talented, are those who have the most practical experience,” “put down the stinky frame and be a small student,” and other extremely precious teachings, continuously improve the awareness of being a small student of the masses, and resolutely decide to live among the masses forever, establish a fish-water relationship with the masses, and not float on the oil surface. When we are in the position of seizing power for the proletariat, we must especially pay attention to “modesty, prudence, guard against arrogance, and guard against impetuosity.” We must not be intoxicated by a temporary success, not be proud of the trust of the masses, not be confused by warm applause, and even more not be corrupted by the flattery of the bourgeoisie. We deeply understand that all achievements are thanks to the power of Mao Zedong Thought and the wisdom and strength of the masses; otherwise, we would achieve nothing. We proletarian revolutionaries should be diligent and devoted, work hard all our lives, be a public servant who never skips work, a small student of the masses who never skips class, not allowing the “official” air to occupy even a tiny bit of space, and not allowing the “self” to occupy even a second of time.

We must remember Chairman Mao’s repeated warnings: “Be both an ‘official’ and a common person,” and forever maintain the character of an ordinary laborer. We must consciously participate in productive labor and not indulge in any special treatment. After more than a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the young revolutionaries understand the truth of “a small ant’s hole can collapse a thousand-foot dam” and pay attention to preventing and stopping problems in their infancy. They always keep a tight grip on every aspect of life. The leading organs of the “Provincial Revolutionary Committee” and other revolutionary mass organizations have never had a small car, and many responsible comrades, as before, completely in the guise of ordinary workers, students, and office workers, come and go among the masses. They said: “The position has changed, but the thought of being a cow for the people cannot change; the environment has changed, but the spirit of hard struggle cannot change; the conditions have changed, but the style of thrift and simplicity cannot change.” We must forever maintain this tradition and carry forward this style, making the attacks of the bourgeoisie find no gaps, and making the beautiful dream of bourgeois restoration of the bourgeoisie become a bubble for generations!

“It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame and imitate King Xiang Yu.” In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must respond to Chairman Mao’s great call to “struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism,” further launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and vigorously carry forward the revolutionary learning style that Chairman Mao has always advocated, ensuring that every latest instruction of Chairman Mao is implemented. We must learn from Hero Li Wenzhong, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever not detach from the masses, forever not stop advancing, continuously consolidate and develop the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought in the mind, ensure that the proletarian iron mountain remains unchanged for thousands of generations, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of Zhejiang!

    学习英雄李文忠，无限忠于毛主席
    为在头脑中牢固树立毛泽东思想统治地位而斗争
    南萍　陈励耘
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权以后，最根本的任务，就是要象无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子的突出代表李文忠那样，无限忠于毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，彻底改造世界观，在人们的头脑里，特别是在各级领导人员的头脑里牢固地树立毛泽东思想的统治地位。只有这样，才能保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
  念念不忘头脑里的“夺权”斗争
    毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”要建立、保持、巩固和发展一个政权，都要先做意识形态方面的工作。剥削阶级的白色政权，建立在资产阶级的“私”字的基础上，从意识形态上，靠人们头脑里的“私”字来巩固；无产阶级的红色政权，建立在无产阶级的“公”字的基础上，靠人们头脑里的“公”字来巩固。如果我们头脑里的“公”字没有牢固地树立起来，红色政权建立起来了也不牢靠。要巩固和发展红色政权，就要千百倍地重视头脑里的夺权斗争。如果我们头脑里毛泽东思想没有扎根，“私”字挤掉了“公”字，我们流血流汗建立起来的红色政权就要改变颜色，资本主义就要复辟。
    毛主席说：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，国内外阶级敌人决不甘心于他们的失败，必然要采取更狡猾、更隐蔽的手段，继续同我们进行斗争。他们的阴谋之一，就是要把在我国复辟资本主义的希望，寄托在我们无产阶级革命派头脑里的“私”字上。因此，思想领域里公与私的阶级斗争更复杂、更尖锐了。他们采取各种阴谋手段向我们进攻，妄图挑动我们头脑里的“私”字，起来夺“公”字的权，以便里应外合，颠覆我们的红色政权。
      “私”字不倒，江山难保。革命干部如果放松对“私”字的斗争，放松了思想改造，久而久之，就会脱离毛主席的革命轨道，走向反面。在被打倒的党内一小撮走资派中，有些本来就是混入革命队伍的叛徒、特务和资产阶级代理人。但也有的是被阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹打中的。我们应该引为鉴戒，时刻警惕自己。
    李文忠同志说得好：“如果不把头脑里的‘私’字的权夺过来，就不能成为一个无产阶级革命战士，就不能完成祖国人民交给的任务，甚至就过不了社会主义这一关。”我们要向李文忠同志学习，永远以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓自己的思想革命化，发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，使头脑里的毛泽东思想统治地位不断巩固和发展。
      在头脑中牢固树立伟大的
  毛泽东思想的统治地位
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。没有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，没有战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的一切。我们要在自己的头脑中破私立公，就必须牢固树立对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，牢固树立毛泽东思想在头脑中的统治地位。就要以林副统帅为光辉榜样，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限信赖伟大领袖毛主席英明正确的领导，对于毛主席的每一个指示坚决照办，对于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚。就是要象李文忠同志所说的那样：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真；保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”我们的红色政权就应该永远掌握在这样无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的人的手上。
    只有无限忠于毛主席，确立毛泽东思想在头脑里的统治地位，才有真正的革命领导权。这次无产阶级文化大革命的事实告诉我们：毛泽东思想是无产阶级政权的命根子。毛主席的指示是全党、全军、全国一切工作的指导方针，亿万人民的每一个革命行动，都是毛泽东思想在直接指挥。谁无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，并在实践中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，谁就能够得到群众的信任和拥护，就有无产阶级的领导权威；反之，谁不忠于毛主席，不高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，谁就要遭到群众的唾弃。
    我们个人能力有限，能够为人民做一点事，完全是靠毛主席，靠毛泽东思想，靠以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，靠群众的智慧和力量。遇事多向毛主席请示，多向上级请示，多和群众商量，不自作聪明，是我们做好工作的最重要的保证。当我们对毛主席的指示认真学习和领会的时候，就感到站得高，看得远，心红眼亮，说话有纲，办事有方，群众就赞成，工作就能取得成绩。当我们对毛主席的指示学习和领会不够的时候，就好象缺了根主心骨，私心杂念就多起来，说话不灵，做事不成，寸步难行，就容易背离毛主席的革命路线，给革命事业造成损失。所以，我们只有无限忠于毛主席，紧紧跟着毛主席，刻苦学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席的最新指示，努力在“用”字上下功夫，真正把毛泽东思想变为自己的中枢神经，使毛泽东思想永远在头脑中掌权，才能为人民掌好权、用好权。我们千忙万忙，把活学活用毛主席著作放到首位永不忘；千变万变，天天读毛主席著作的制度永不变。千头万绪，一定要先抓大办毛泽东思想学习班，掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮。
    以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武
  器，向头脑里“私”字打进攻战
    要无限忠于毛主席，在头脑里巩固和发展“公”字的统治地位，必须和自己头脑里的“私”字作你死我活的斗争。毛主席说：“对于中国人民脑子中的落后的东西，我们要去扫除，就象用扫帚打扫房子一样。从来没有不经过打扫而自动去掉的灰尘。”我们就是要用毛泽东思想这把铁扫帚，在自己的头脑里狠狠地来回打扫，把肮脏发臭的“私”字，统统扫地出门，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对它实行毫不留情的专政。
    打蛇打到七寸上，斗私斗到要害处。斗私，要狠抓大节。对待毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线采取什么态度，是高于一切的大节。目前，在我们革命队伍内部，有一部分同志存在着比较严重的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。他们对毛泽东思想，对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，不是坚决执行，而是采取利己主义、实用主义的态度，符合个人和小团体利益的就拥护执行，不符合的就七折八扣，消极抵制。这是大节上的不忠。这是最大的私。所以产生资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就是因为头脑里“私”字作怪。我们一定要对“私”字狠批狠斗，斗出一颗对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的红心。真正象伟大的共产主义战士李文忠那样：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    在大节问题上斗私，就要象李文忠同志那样，打进攻战，一发现“私”字，就积极进攻，反复冲杀，不让它有立足之地，这样才能确保“公”字在头脑里的统治地位。打进攻战，就是要“敢”字当头，敢于用只争朝夕的精神斗，敢于用严于责己的精神斗，敢于用完全彻底的精神斗，敢于用不断革命的精神斗。
    敢于用只争朝夕的精神斗私。干革命，分秒必争，这是我们无产阶级革命派的一个显著特点。和自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，也要分秒必争，特别是处于领导地位的同志，头脑里出现一个“私”字的念头，对贯彻毛主席的革命路线就可能起很大干扰作用，就会给革命造成很大损失。斗私，不能等出了问题再斗，要主动捕捉战机，跟踪追击，狠斗“私”字一闪念，不让私心滑过去。有了只争朝夕的精神，就会一发现“私”字在捣乱就揪住不放，以“老三篇”为武器，马上把它消灭。浙江“省联总”等组织的负责人，为了贯彻毛主席的最新指示，以只争朝夕的精神带头斗私，克服派性，促进了革命大联合。群众说得好：“头头斗私只争朝夕，毛主席的战略部署畅通无阻。”这是一条宝贵经验。
    敢于用严于责己的精神斗私。在人民内部，在革命派之间，能不能按照毛主席的革命路线，以共产主义者的伟大胸怀，团结一切可以团结的人共同革命，关键在能不能严于责己，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。“私”字在头脑里占统治地位的人，总是对己宽，对人严。把人家讲得一无是处，把自己看得完美无缺。唯我独左，唯我独革，唯我独好。毛主席教导我们说：“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。”“必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神”。严于责己就是多作自我批评。不但要有闻过则喜、欢迎别人“挑刺”的愿望，更要有引火烧身、敢于自己“揭短”的风格。要经常地主动在群众面前亮私心，揭“疮疤”，树“靶子”，把隐藏在灵魂深处的“私”字揪出来“示众”，使它变成过街老鼠，发动大家，围而歼之。有些工厂开始搞不好革命大联合，在部队毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，革命群众组织的负责人用严于责己的精神做自我批评，以解放全人类的共产主义胸怀，以无比深厚的阶级感情，丢掉个人恩怨，极端热情诚恳地帮助受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，实现了革命大联合。
    敢于用完全彻底的精神斗私。就是要在灵魂深处刮十二级台风，拆“私”字的台，拔“私”字的根，捣“私”字的窝，打歼灭战，不留半点尾巴。当无产阶级革命派在资产阶级反动路线下处境十分困难的时候，是顾虑重重，调和折衷，还是敢冒风险，坚决支持？我们带着这个问题学习“老三篇”，排除了一切私心杂念，决心誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们肩并肩，心连心，同呼吸，共命运。
    敢于用不断革命的精神斗私。要时时斗，事事斗，处处斗，反复斗，永远斗。当毛主席革命路线在浙江取得决定性胜利的时刻，在一阵阵“学习”“致敬”的口号声和一阵阵的热烈掌声中，我们和无产阶级革命派的领导人、革命的领导干部，共同重温了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”。毛主席的这一教导，使我们感到分外亲切。大家深深体会到：只要世界上还有阶级和阶级斗争，在我们头脑里，公与私的斗争，就一刻也不会停息。斗私，是不能放假的。只要你稍一松劲，“私”字就会化为官、暮、骄、娇等气，兴风作浪，反攻复辟。毛主席告诫我们说：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。我们要做永远紧跟毛主席革命到底的无产阶级革命派，就要不断地用毛泽东思想狠专自己头脑里“私”字的政，使毛泽东思想在自己的头脑里永远占统治地位。
    到群众斗争的大风大浪中去学
  习磨炼
      “无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我们重温毛主席的这一伟大教导，感到分外亲切。无数事实特别是李文忠同志成长的道路，再次向我们证明：革命群众斗争的大风大浪，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂，是斗私批修的最好战场。
    到群众斗争的大风大浪中去学习磨炼，还是脱离群众斗争，闭门修养？这是一个是否真正革命，是否忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。
    毛主席教导我们：要判断一个人“是一个假马克思主义者还是一个真马克思主义者，只要看他和广大的工农群众的关系如何，就完全清楚了。”到群众斗争中去学习磨炼，正象李文忠同志所讲的：“依靠群众的力量，开展‘人民战争’”，私字一露头便陷入汪洋大海之中，毫无藏身之地，越炼思想越红；闭门修养，独善其身，为的是自己，靠的还是自己，与群众斗争根本隔绝，整天跟一个“我”字“形影相吊”，只能是越养越私，顺着《修养》的黑路，跌进反革命修正主义的深渊。
    在群众斗争中更好地磨炼，就要不断增强当群众小学生的自觉性。我们要反复学习毛主席有关“群众是真正的英雄”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”，“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”等极其宝贵的教导，不断提高当群众小学生的自觉性，下定决心，永远生活在群众中间，跟群众建立鱼水情谊，不要油漂水面。当我们处在为无产阶级掌权的地位时，特别要注意“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁”。不因一时一事的成绩而陶醉，不因群众的信任而骄傲，不为热烈的掌声所迷乱，更不为资产阶级的捧场所腐蚀。我们深深懂得，一切成就，都是依靠毛泽东思想的威力，都是依靠群众的智慧和力量，要不然我们就会一事无成。我们无产阶级革命派就是应当兢兢业业，鞠躬尽瘁，做一个一辈子不旷工的人民勤务员，一辈子不旷课的群众小学生，不让“官”气有一丝一毫的位置可占，不让“私”字有一分一秒的空子可钻。
    要记住毛主席的谆谆告诫：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，永远保持普通劳动者的本色。自觉地参加生产劳动，不搞半点特殊化。有了一年多无产阶级文化大革命实践的革命小将们，很懂得“蝼蚁之穴，溃千丈之堤”的道理，很注意防微杜渐。他们对生活上的各个关口，一直把得很严。“省联总”等革命群众组织的领导机构，始终没有一部小汽车，许多负责同志，一如既往，完全以普通的工人、学生、机关工作人员的姿态，来往于群众之中。他们说：“地位变了，做人民老黄牛的思想不能变；环境变了，艰苦奋斗的精神不能变；条件变了，勤俭朴素的作风不能变。”我们就是要永远保持这个传统，发扬这种作风，叫资产阶级的进攻找不到一丝缺口，叫资产阶级复辟的美梦世代成为泡影！
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我们一定要响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，大力发扬毛主席一贯倡导的革命好学风，保证毛主席的一系列最新指示条条落实。我们一定要向英雄李文忠同志学习，永远忠于毛主席，永远不脱离群众，永远不停止前进的步伐，不断地巩固和发展毛泽东思想在头脑中的统治地位，保证无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代永不变色，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在浙江上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
