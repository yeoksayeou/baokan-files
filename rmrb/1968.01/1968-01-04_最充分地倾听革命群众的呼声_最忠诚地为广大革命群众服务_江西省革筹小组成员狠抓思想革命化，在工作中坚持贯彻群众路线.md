Members of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group focus on ideological revolutionization, adhering to the mass line in their work.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang, members of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group are focusing on their own ideological revolutionization to fundamentally solve the problem of correctly treating the masses. They follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, adhere to the mass line in their work, and have achieved good results.

The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group regards the people as the true heroes and sees themselves as students of the masses and servants of the people. They implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit. In their work, they maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the masses, rooting themselves among the masses, and are determined to follow the mass line and serve the people wholeheartedly for life.

To fundamentally solve the problem of correctly treating the masses and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's mass line, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group focuses on the following four points:

1. Strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focus on the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres, and fundamentally establish a firm mass perspective.

Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group deeply feel that only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought can one most resolutely implement Chairman Mao's mass line. They believe that leading cadres going to the masses is not only a matter of work methods and work style, but also a matter of fundamental stance, fundamental attitude, and worldview, and a profound ideological revolution. They say that only by constantly transforming one's thinking, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide one's soul, truly loving the masses, believing in the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, and maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the masses can one forever represent the interests and demands of the masses, strictly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and guide the revolutionary masses to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, in addition to adhering to the practice of reading Chairman Mao's works every day, also adhere to collective study of Chairman Mao's works every Thursday morning. Some comrades work tirelessly until late at night, still study Chairman Mao's works, report to Chairman Mao their thoughts and work of the day, write study notes, and strive to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of their lives. Because of this, they can seriously study, deeply understand, firmly believe in, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of brilliant teachings on the mass line, fundamentally establishing a firm mass perspective.

2. Go deep into the masses, fully listen to the voices of the masses, solicit the opinions of the masses, and timely grasp the active thoughts of the masses.

Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group regard going deep into the masses, going to the grassroots and the scene to solve problems as the primary and most basic link in implementing Chairman Mao's mass line. They put aside their airs, with the spirit of being willing to be students, go to the masses, and together with the masses study the new trends, new problems, new achievements, and new experiences in the movement and production, listen to the opinions of the masses, discover the active thoughts of the masses, and guide the masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, promoting the Cultural Revolution and production forward.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To solve the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, to handle the relationship between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around, to see for themselves, to adhere to the mass line, to consult with the masses on everything, to be students of the masses." Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group always regard Chairman Mao's teaching as the guiding principle for all their work and the highest principle for handling all problems.

3. Go deep into the masses, focus on the movement's center to grasp living examples, use examples to drive the general, and let the masses educate themselves.

In implementing and executing Chairman Mao's mass line, members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group pay special attention to examples. They often go deep into the masses, especially at critical moments, to discover, cultivate, establish, and propagate examples, using examples to drive the general and promote the smooth progress of various tasks.

The work method of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group in grasping examples is based on the belief that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves. They believe that examples exist among the masses and that examples among the masses can best educate the masses. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly believe that "the people have limitless creativity" and that "the masses harbor a tremendous socialist enthusiasm," and wholeheartedly go deep into the masses to discover and establish examples, using examples to drive the whole.

In the Fuzhou region, revolutionary factions seriously helped those who had participated in conservative organizations and were deceived to study Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's principles for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and conducted patient and detailed ideological and political work on those who were deceived, warmly helping them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group timely grasped this example and widely publicized it, inviting the Fuzhou revolutionary faction to form a reporting team to tour and report in various places, and printing the Fuzhou experience for all mass organizations in the province to learn. Revolutionary factions in various places were greatly educated and inspired, and all strengthened their work of uniting, educating, and winning over those who were deceived, thoroughly isolating a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

After Chairman Mao's series of important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were issued, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group focused on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and set examples from all aspects. In the great criticism, they set examples of Hongdu Machinery Factory and Jiangxi Normal University; in the great alliance, they set examples of the Gear Factory and the literary and art circles; in daring to liberate cadres and doing a good job in the revolutionary three-in-one combination, they set the example of Jiangxi Tractor Factory. These examples played a significant role in Nanchang City and the entire province.

4. Go deep into the masses, spread Chairman Mao's voice, and fully mobilize the wisdom and initiative of the people. This is the most important and fundamental point.

"Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it will become an endless force, becoming an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group regards spreading Chairman Mao's voice as the soul of all their work, placing it at the forefront of all work. They do mass work every day, aiming to spread Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's voice to the masses every day, every hour, every minute. They all regard themselves as the most loyal, most enthusiastic, and most active spreaders of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's voice. The main responsible comrade of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, Comrade Cheng Shiqing, said: "Our task is only one, that is, to faithfully and strictly pass on Chairman Mao's voice and implement Chairman Mao's instructions."

As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the leading members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, with a resolute fighting posture, take the lead in going to the grassroots and the masses to spread Chairman Mao's voice and implement Chairman Mao's instructions.

    最充分地倾听革命群众的呼声  忠诚地为广大革命群众服务
    江西省革筹小组成员狠抓思想革命化，在工作中坚持贯彻群众路线
    据新华社南昌电　江西省革命委员会筹备小组的成员狠抓自己的思想革命化，从根本上解决正确对待群众的问题。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在工作中坚持贯彻群众路线，取得了很好的效果。
    江西省革筹小组把人民群众看做是真正的英雄，把自己当做群众的小学生、人民的勤务员，执行的是毛主席的相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众首创精神的无产阶级革命路线。他们在工作中坚持和广大群众保持最广泛、最经常、最密切的联系，把自己扎根在群众之中，决心走一辈子群众路线，全心全意为人民服务一辈子。
    为了从根本上解决正确对待群众的问题，坚决贯彻毛主席的群众路线，江西省革筹小组着重抓了以下四条：
    一、努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓领导干部的思想革命化，从根本上树立牢固的群众观点。
    省革筹小组的成员深刻地体会到，只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，才能最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线。他们认为，领导干部到群众中去，这不仅是一个工作方法、思想作风的问题，而且是一个根本立场、根本态度的问题，是一个世界观的问题，是一场深刻的思想革命。他们说，只有不断地改造思想，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的灵魂，真正做到象毛主席所教导的那样热爱人民群众，相信人民群众，尊重人民群众的首创精神，同广大人民群众保持最广泛、最经常、最密切的联系，才能永远代表人民群众的利益和要求，才能不折不扣地按照毛主席的革命路线办事，也才能引导革命群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    省革筹小组的成员，除了坚持天天读毛主席著作的制度以外，还坚持每星期四上午集体学习毛主席著作。有的同志每天废寝忘食地工作到深夜，还要学习毛主席著作，向毛主席汇报一天的思想和工作，写学习笔记，努力做到用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟。正因为这样，他们对于毛主席有关群众路线的一系列光辉教导，就能做到认真的学习，深刻的领会，思想上坚信不疑，行动上坚决贯彻，从根本上树立起坚定的群众观点。
    二、深入到群众中去，最充分地倾听群众呼声，征求群众意见，及时地抓住群众的活思想。
    省革筹小组的成员，把深入到群众中去，深入基层和现场解决问题，做为贯彻毛主席群众路线首要的、最基本的一环。他们放下架子，以甘当小学生的精神，到群众中去，和群众一起研究运动、生产中的新动向、新问题、新成就、新经验，听取群众意见，发现群众的活思想，引导群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，推动无产阶级文化大革命和生产向前发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”江西省革筹小组的成员，把毛主席的这一教导时刻当作进行一切工作的指导方针，当作处理一切问题的最高原则。
    三、深入到群众中去，围绕运动中心抓活的典型，以典型带动一般，让群众自己教育自己。
    省革筹小组成员在贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线中，特别注意抓典型。他们经常深入群众，尤其在关键时刻深入到群众中去，发现典型，培养典型，树立典型，宣传典型，通过典型带动一般，推动各项工作的顺利开展。
    革筹小组抓典型的工作方法，是建筑在充分相信群众能够自己教育自己、自己解放自己的思想基础上的。他们认为，典型存在于群众之中，群众中的典型最能教育群众。他们遵照毛主席的教导，坚信“人民群众有无限的创造力”，坚信“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”，全心全意深入到群众中去发现典型、树立典型，以典型推动全面。
    抚州地区革命派认真帮助参加过保守组织的受蒙蔽群众学习毛主席著作，遵照毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，对受蒙蔽群众进行耐心的、细致的思想政治工作，热情帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。革筹小组领导成员及时抓住这个典型大力宣传，邀请抚州革命派组成报告团到各地巡回作报告，印发抚州的经验给全省各群众组织学习，各地革命派受到很大的教育和启发，都纷纷加强对受蒙蔽群众的团结、教育和争取工作，彻底孤立了党内一小撮走资派。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列重要指示下达以后，革筹小组大抓贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的好典型，从各方面树立榜样。在革命大批判方面，他们树立了洪都机械厂和江西师范学院两个典型；在革命大联合方面，树立了齿轮厂和文艺界两个典型；在大胆解放干部、搞好革命三结合方面，树立了江西拖拉机厂的典型。这些典型在南昌市和全省都起了很大的推动作用。
    四、深入到群众中去，向群众传播毛主席的声音，最充分发挥人民群众的智慧和积极性。这是最重要、最根本的一条。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。毛泽东思想一旦为广大人民群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。革筹小组把传播毛主席的声音做为自己全部工作的灵魂，摆在一切工作的首位。他们天天做群众工作，就是要每天、每时、每刻地把毛泽东思想、把毛主席的声音传播到群众中去。他们都把自己做为毛泽东思想、毛主席声音的最忠诚、最热情、最积极的传播者。省革筹小组主要负责人程世清同志说：“我们的任务只有一个，就是原原本本、不折不扣地把毛主席的声音传下去，把毛主席的指示贯彻下去。”
    毛主席的每一个最新指示一下达，省革筹小组领导成员就以雷厉风行的战斗姿态，带头到基层去，到群众中去传播毛主席的声音，贯彻毛主席的指示。
