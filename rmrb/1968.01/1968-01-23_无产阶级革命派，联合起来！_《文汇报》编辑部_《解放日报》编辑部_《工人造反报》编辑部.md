Proletarian revolutionaries, comrades!

"Wind and rain bring spring's return, flying snow welcomes spring's arrival." On the frontline of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we recall that on this day last year, we proletarian revolutionaries were engaged in a life-and-death struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. During the stormy days of the "January Revolution," from Hangzhou Bay to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and as far as Bengbu and Xuzhou, we proletarian revolutionaries, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart, fighting day and night together. The entire Yangtze River basin was filled with songs of victory, with red flags flying everywhere, and everywhere was the domain of the proletarian revolutionaries. Comrades, every time we recall these glorious days of struggle, we are filled with joy!

However, over the past year, we have often pondered a question: During the forward march of the "January Revolution," the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels experienced a period of internal division. In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the proletarian revolutionaries also engaged in "internal warfare." In some places and units, this has not yet stopped. Why? Why? Why?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions."

Chairman Mao's teachings have opened our eyes. Recently, we Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries, together with comrades from other places, have jointly exposed a small group of evil-doers. Although we acted late, these evil-doers have caused damage to our revolutionary cause. However, exposing this small group of evil-doers is a good thing. It will help us open our eyes and understand Chairman Mao's instructions more deeply.

Below, we present an example of a small group for everyone to see what kind of people they are. In certain regions and units, they were quite "famous" and had deceived some people. However, upon investigation, they turned out to be a bunch of monsters and demons. The leader of this small group, Li Shunzhi, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks during the War of Resistance, was expelled from the Party in 1940 for his direct involvement in a bandit spy case, and later re-entered the Party, holding positions such as deputy county magistrate of Jiangyin County and member of the Changzhou Municipal Committee. He has always been anti-Party and anti-socialism, and was labeled a rightist in 1958 and expelled from the Party. Another leader, Qi Zhen, successively held positions such as director of a certain bureau in Gaoyou County and section chief in a certain bureau in Shanghai. He was a close associate of Huang XX, the anti-revolutionary revisionist director of a certain bureau in Shanghai, and was released from a long-term prison sentence due to Huang's intervention. The criminal Hu Han infiltrated the Party in 1940, served as the district chief of the Fourth District of Wujin County, and in 1941, he defected with a gun to join the Japanese special service stations in Changzhou and Jiangyin, engaging in espionage activities. In 1942, he re-entered the Party and successively held positions such as director of a certain bureau in Yangzhou City. The criminal Huang Panlin was expelled from the Party during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1952. This small group of evil-doers is not isolated. Many within the Shanghai and Jiangsu Party who are capitalist roaders are their "old superiors" and "old colleagues." They have always been dependent on each other, colluding and using each other, and acting in cahoots.

Some say that Li Shunzhi, Qi Zhen, Hu Han, and Huang Panlin are "old rebels." That's wrong. Some of them are spies and traitors, and some were originally capitalist roaders themselves. They have never rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. On the contrary, they have always protected their "old colleagues" and rebelled against the proletarian revolutionaries. When the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries rose up to attack the capitalist roaders Chen Pishan and Cao Qichou within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Li Shunzhi wrote in a letter to his comrades, flatteringly praising the old "Shanghai Municipal Party Committee as correct and able to withstand severe storms," and the old "Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's relationship with the Shanghai working class can be said to be like that of a mother and her children." When the Shanghai revolutionary masses criticized and struggled against Chen Pishan, Cao Qichou, and other capitalist roaders within the Party, they were even more like mourners, weeping and wailing, saying that "these responsible comrades, politically 'powerful' though they may be, have been 'swept away,' and even their physical lives are under serious threat." Their class stance is very clear.

It is the same in Shanghai and Jiangsu. Within the Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee, there is a capitalist roader named Gao who has always been anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. He was exposed by the revolutionary masses at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. In January 1967, he sent people to Shanghai to contact Li Shunzhi, Qi Zhen, and others, asking this group of monsters and demons to "rehabilitate" him. Li and Qi were overjoyed and promised to do their best for Gao. They used coded language and aliases, exchanged information through letters, telephone calls, and dispatched liaison personnel, frequently communicating and plotting. They also wrote to Zhang XX, the deputy director of a certain bureau in Jiangsu Province and a traitor, asking Zhang XX to contact Chen XX and Bao XX, members of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and capitalist roaders, to "come out and lead." Zhang XX stayed in Shanghai for over forty days during the National Day in 1967, frequently meeting with Li Shunzhi, Qi Zhen, Hu Han, and others in secret rooms to analyze the situation and study counter-revolutionary strategies. After Qi Zhen reported the situation in the Suzhou area to Zhang, he "instructed" Zhang to plan to "unify" the mass organizations in the rural areas of Wujin, Jiangyin, Danyang, and Zhenjiang after the autumn harvest, and to report to "Chen Secretary" to strengthen "leadership." Zhang XX asked Qi Zhen about the situation of various mass organizations in Changzhou, asking Qi Zhen, "Do you have the strength?" Qi Zhen replied, "We have some, but we lack weapons." Zhang XX immediately decided, "If you have the strength, eliminate 'XX' (a revolutionary mass organization); if you don't have the strength, don't do it piecemeal." Qi Zhen followed Zhang's "instructions," trying every means to obtain weapons, causing long-term conflicts and multiple armed clashes among several mass organizations in Changzhou and along the Shanghai-Nanjing line. They even arrogantly planned to first control the cities and villages along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, occupy Suzhou and Jiangsu, and then control Shanghai and Zhejiang. In some counties and cities in Suzhou, they "linked up" with many counter-revolutionary revisionists who had been overthrown by the revolutionary masses, cadres who had been removed during the Four Cleanups, encouraging them to "come out and rebel," to rehabilitate themselves, and "not to wait." Look, how closely they collude with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party! In their words and actions, is there anything that can be called the smell of proletarian revolutionaries? Isn't it more realistic to say they are a small group of vanguards for the restoration of capitalism?

Then, why do they want to raise the banner of "rebellion"? The reason is simple. In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee was finally overthrown by the proletarian revolutionaries, and Chen Pishan and Cao Qichou were finally finished. Originally, those who openly opposed the proletarian revolutionaries and protected the handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies within the Party, such as Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen, felt that this approach was no longer feasible and too obvious. Thus, harboring a counter-revolutionary "anger" in their hearts, they changed their appearance and disguise, also raising the banner of "rebellion" and posing as "proletarian revolutionaries." They infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and began to play Sun Wukong's "heart-digging trick."

Li and Qi and their ilk are not only "rebelling," but they also pretend to be more revolutionary than anyone else. Everyone knows that the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters ("Workers' General Headquarters") is a revolutionary mass organization recognized by all. To rebel against the proletariat in Shanghai, one must rebel against the "Workers' General Headquarters." Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen understand this. However, rebelling against the "Workers' General Headquarters" is not easy. They, with their counter-revolutionary instincts, discovered that some staff members of the "Workers' General Headquarters" had heavy personal interests, and they instilled bourgeois factionalism into them, urging them to form their own factions and seize power from the proletarian revolutionaries. In January 1967, they secretly planned to establish the so-called "Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters Rebel Headquarters" (look, what a difficult name to read, it should be read as: the headquarters to rebel against the "Workers' General Headquarters"), and they respectively appointed themselves as standing committee members, committee members, and advisors. Li Shunzhi took on the role of "secretary," drafting reactionary documents against the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters," printing leaflets, carving seals, and deciding to "grab strength" and "recruit troops," attempting to dismantle the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters." However, the workers of Shanghai remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, and the basic experience of the "January Revolution" was that the proletarian revolutionaries united to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The Shanghai working class insisted on proletarian party spirit and opposed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and the evil plot of this small group of bad elements was foiled.

Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen and their ilk also extended their evil hands to the cities and villages along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway.

This group of political swindlers used even more despicable methods in Suzhou. They dared to impersonate and steal the names of "Central Cultural Revolution Group staff," "Shanghai Revolutionary Committee standing committee members," and "Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters" "standing committee members" and "advisors," swindling their way everywhere. It was with this trick that they deceived a part of the masses in Changzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin along the Shanghai-Nanjing line, gaining their trust. Some became "strategists" of certain organizations, some became "advisors" of certain organizations, some became "commanders-in-chief," and some even simultaneously controlled two revolutionary organizations. In Changzhou, they once impersonated the name of "Central Cultural Revolution Group staff" to "support" a certain organization in seizing power from the old Changzhou Municipal Party Committee; soon, they "supported" other organizations that opposed this organization to seize power from the old Changzhou Municipal Party Committee. It was with this trick that they stirred up evil winds and lit ghost fires everywhere, inciting factionalism among some people, creating great divisions, and instigating large-scale armed clashes, plotting to use one revolutionary organization to attack another, waiting for both to be defeated, so that they could realize their counter-revolutionary restoration plan. The large-scale armed clashes along the Shanghai-Nanjing line and in the Suzhou area are closely related to this group of counter-revolutionaries. In July 1967, when serious armed clashes occurred in Changzhou, Qi Zhen stayed by the special telephone line of the Shanghai Railway Bureau Electric Power Section for three days and nights, conducting "remote control." He also convened several meetings in Shanghai to draft "battle plans." In September 1967, when Changzhou experienced another large-scale armed clash, Qi Zhen again stayed by the special telephone line at the Zhenjiang Railway Station all night, conducting operations based on the map. Qi Zhen, while maintaining close contact with Li Shunzhi and Hu Han, who were waiting in a certain unit in Shanghai, also convened emergency meetings with his comrades from Changzhou, trying every means to obtain weapons, dispatching "reinforcement troops," and establishing a logistics command center in Zhenjiang, stirring up discord, deepening the antagonistic sentiments of certain revolutionary mass organizations, and instigating continued armed clashes between the two factions.

This gang of scoundrels used extremely vicious means to instigate armed clashes. They feared that the two factions would not fight, feared that the masses would not fall for their tricks, and even incited "firing the first shot" and "not just military defense." Li Shunzhi wrote in a letter to a leader of a revolutionary mass organization in Changzhou, saying, "Such armed clashes do not need to fear making the mistake of 'firing the first shot.' 'Pure military defense is not enough, and now it seems that we should attack, and we can attack.' This gang of scoundrels incited the masses to open fire on their own class brothers!

They also feared that the mass organizations would not listen to their commands, so they used various relationships to establish armed forces that they could directly control. Li Shunzhi directly controlled a "militia company" with dozens of guns in XX. He also drafted a counter-revolutionary activity plan, proposing to "arm a batch of rural small teams, each small team equipped with one machine gun and twenty rifles... Additionally, mobilize several companies for mobile operations."

All reactionary forces always overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. They see the absolute superiority of the proletariat as an absolute inferiority. Li Shunzhi, Qi Zhen, and this group of foxes and dogs, when they were swindling in certain cities and rural areas in Suzhou and some weak revolutionary areas in Shanghai, temporarily deceiving some people, were they not blinded by their greed and forgetful of their shame? In a letter to Zhang XX, the deputy director of a certain bureau in Jiangsu Province and a traitor, they could not help but reveal their counter-revolutionary joy: "The Nanjing-Shanghai line can be said to be completely under our control." However, history is merciless. In no time, they were engulfed in the vast ocean of revolutionary masses, revealing their true forms as monsters and demons, and were exposed by the revolutionary masses.

Dear comrades:

What we have talked about here is only a small group like Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen. The Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries have not yet fully exposed all their crimes. But are these facts not enough to awaken us? Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Our people's eyes are not bright, and they are not good at distinguishing good people from bad people. We are good at distinguishing good people from bad people in normal situations, but we are not good at distinguishing certain people in special situations." Now is the time to open our eyes.

Since there are no fundamental conflicts of interest within our working class, why can't two revolutionary mass organizations in some places unite? Why do some places experience armed clashes and bloody conflicts one after another? When someone incites us to raise our fists against our own class brothers, we should think more, why fight? Whose idea is this? Who is this person? Is he our friend or our enemy? We must ask several whys!

Of course, there are only a few bad people like Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen. It is wrong to see no bad people; it is also not in line with reality to think there are many bad people. At the same time, we must not, because the black hands of this type of bad people have once intervened in certain mass organizations, indiscriminately list these organizations as bad organizations.

Know that Li Shunzhi, Qi Zhen, and their ilk are a group of reactionary pragmatists. They can support an organization today and oppose it tomorrow. They support or oppose an organization entirely out of their counter-revolutionary needs. Once they realize their arrogant plan to restore capitalism, they will impose fascist dictatorship on all revolutionary masses. The question is, why do some of our comrades fall for their tricks? There are many reasons, but we must frankly say that the most important reason is the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a poisonous snake. That is to say, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society use the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism on certain people within the revolutionary rebels as a means of class struggle against the proletariat. Especially when the class enemy's doomsday is approaching, and all means of suppression and deception have failed, they, like grasping at straws, desperately use the private interests of certain people in our revolutionary ranks, viciously instilling factionalism. You want to build strength and recruit troops, form factions, then they will do their best to develop your forces, expand your factions, and gain your trust. Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen and their ilk, disguised as "old rebels," are poisonous snakes, using this method to entangle certain people.

Here, we have not mentioned how they used certain people's factionalism. Because the purpose of writing this article is only to expose the evil deeds of this small group and sound the alarm for some comrades who are still eager to engage in factionalism. We sincerely hope that our dear comrades will carefully review the history of the struggle, why comrades on the same front suddenly became opposed? Is our common enemy not the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, not the monsters and demons in society, but our own class brothers? Do we not have a thousand and one reasons to unite and fight against the enemy, and not a single reason to split? What is it that has divided us? Is it not the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism that has infiltrated the proletarian revolutionaries? Is it not the black hands of the bourgeoisie that have infiltrated our proletarian revolutionaries? Down with factionalism! Cut off the black hands! Proletarian revolutionaries unite! In the revolutionary struggle, what the proletariat loses are chains, and what we gain is the whole world! Let us, with our actual actions, implement the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, and welcome the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    无产阶级革命派，联合起来！
    《文汇报》编辑部　《解放日报》编辑部　《工人造反报》编辑部无产阶级革命派战友们，同志们！
    “风雨送春归，飞雪迎春到。”在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的火线上，回想去年今日，我们无产阶级革命派，正在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开生死搏斗。在“一月革命”风暴兴起的日子里，从杭州湾，到苏州、无锡、常州、镇江、南京，直到蚌埠、徐州，我们无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，肩并肩，心连心，日日夜夜团结在一起，战斗在一起。整个长江两岸，歌声震天，红旗如画，到处是无产阶级革命派的天下。战友们，同志们，每当我们回忆起这些壮丽的战斗的日子，我们大家是多么高兴呵！
    但是，一年来，我们常常想到一个问题：在“一月革命”的风暴胜利前进的时候，我们上海工人革命造反派内部一度出现了分裂现象，江苏、浙江、安徽的无产阶级革命派也发生了“内战”。有的地方，有的单位，到现在也还没有停下来。这究竟是为什么？为什么？为什么？
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    毛主席的教导，擦亮了我们的眼睛。不久以前，我们上海无产阶级革命派，同各地的战友们协同作战，揪出了一小撮专门干罪恶勾当的坏人。尽管我们动手迟了，这些坏人给我们的革命事业造成了损失，但是，把这一小撮坏人揪出来示众，是一件大好事，它将会帮助我们擦亮眼睛，帮助我们更深刻地领会毛主席的指示。
    下面，我们举出一个小集团作例子，请大家看一看这是些什么货色。他们在某些地区、某些单位，是很有点“名气”的，曾经欺骗了一些人。但是一查，却原来都是一些牛鬼蛇神。这个小集团的头头李顺之，在抗战时期钻进革命队伍，一九四○年，因为他同一个匪特案件直接有关，开除党籍，后又混入党内，曾窃据江阴县副县长、常州地委委员等职务，一贯反党反社会主义，一九五八年被划为右派分子，清洗出党。又一个头头戚拯，先后窃据高邮县某局局长，上海市某局科长等职，是原上海市某局局长、反革命修正主义分子黄××的亲信，因为触犯国法，判了长期徒刑，是这个姓黄的把他减刑释放出来的。罪犯胡汉，一九四○年混入党内，曾任武进县第四区区长，一九四一年带枪叛变投敌，参加了常州、江阴日寇特工站，从事特务活动；一九四二年又混入党内，先后窃据扬州市某局局长等职。罪犯黄盘林，是早在一九五二年镇压反革命运动中就清洗出党的坏人。这一小撮坏人不是孤立的。上海和江苏党内一小撮走资派，有不少人是这批牛鬼蛇神的“老上级”、“老同事”，他们从来就是相依为命，相互勾结，相互利用，狼狈为奸的。
    有人说，李顺之、戚拯、胡汉、黄盘林是“老造反”。不对。他们有的是特务、叛徒，有的本身原来就是走资本主义道路的当权派，他们对党内一小撮走资派，从来没有造过反。恰恰相反，他们死保他们的“老同事”，大造无产阶级革命派的反。当上海无产阶级革命派起来，向旧上海市委内的走资派陈丕显、曹荻秋之流进攻的时候，李顺之写给同党的一封信中，就肉麻地吹捧旧“上海市委是正确和经得起大风大浪的严重考验的”，旧“上海市委与上海工人阶级的关系，可以说是母亲与儿女的关系”，上海革命群众批判、斗争陈丕显、曹荻秋等党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的时候，他们更是如丧考妣，痛哭流涕地说什么“这些负责同志政治上‘威风’固然‘扫地’，即肉体生命，也遭到严重威胁”。他们站在哪个阶级的立场上，是十分清楚的。
    在上海是这样，对江苏也是这样。镇江地委内有一个姓高的走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，在文化大革命初期就被革命群众揪了出来。一九六七年一月，他就派人到上海同李顺之、戚拯等人联系，要这批牛鬼蛇神为他“翻案”。李、戚等犯高兴极了，表示一定要为高某卖命。他们还运用黑话、代号，通过信件、电话和派出联络人员，往来频繁，交换情报，密谋策划。他们还写信给江苏省××厅副厅长、叛徒张××，要张××同江苏省委一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、省委书记处成员陈×、包××取得联系，要陈、包“站出来领导”。张××在一九六七年国庆节还到上海住了四十多天，同李顺之、戚拯、胡汉等多次在密室中分析形势，研究反革命策略。当戚拯向张汇报了苏南地区情况以后，曾“请示”张，计划在秋收后把武进、江阴、丹阳、镇江等农村的群众组织“统一起来”，要张××回南京后报告“陈书记”，由“陈书记”加强“领导”。张××向戚拯查问了有关常州各个群众组织的情况，问戚拯：“手中有没有力量？”戚答：“有一部分，就是武器少。”张××当即决定：“如果有力量，索性把‘××’（一个革命群众组织）干掉它；没有力量，不要零零碎碎地搞。”戚犯就照张的“指示”办了，想方设法搞武器，在常州和沪宁线制造事端，使几个群众组织长期对立，并多次发生武斗。他们几个人还狂妄地做出计划，要先控制沪宁沿线的城市和乡村，占领苏南，进而控制上海和浙江。他们在苏南一些县市“串连”了许多被革命群众打倒的反革命修正主义分子，四清运动中的下台干部，鼓励他们“站出来造反”，为自己翻案，“千万不要等待”。请看，他们同党内一小撮走资派勾结得多么紧呵！在他们的言论和行动中，有哪一点可以称得上是无产阶级革命派的气味？说他们是一小撮复辟资本主义的急先锋，不是更切合实际吗？
    那末，他们为什么要打着“造反”的旗号呢？这个道理很简单。在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，旧上海市委终于被无产阶级革命派推翻了，陈丕显、曹荻秋之流也终于完蛋了。原来公开反对无产阶级革命派，死保党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务的李顺之、戚拯一伙亡命之徒，感到这样做不行了，太露骨了。于是，内心怀着一股反革命的“怒火”，改头换面，乔装打扮，也打起“造反”的旗号来，充当起“无产阶级革命派”来了。他们钻进革命队伍内部，搞孙悟空的“挖心战”来了。
    李、戚之流不只是要“造反”，而且装得比谁都革命。大家知道，上海工人革命造反总司令部（“工总司”）是大家公认的革命群众组织。要在上海造无产阶级的反，就不能不造“工总司”的反。李顺之、戚拯之流是懂得这一点的。但是，要造“工总司”的反，也不大容易。他们凭着他们反革命的嗅觉，发现了“工总司”工作人员中某些人的私心很重，就向他们灌输资产阶级的派性，要他们另拉山头，向无产阶级革命派夺权。在一九六七年一月间，他们串连了一些人，秘密筹划建立所谓“上海工人革命造反总司令部造反司令部”（请看，这是一个多么难读的名字，应读作：造“工总司”反的司令部），并分别自封为常委、委员、顾问，李顺之自任“秘书”，起草反对上海“工总司”的反动文件，印刷传单，刻制图章，决定“抓实力”、“拉队伍”，妄图把上海“工总司”搞垮。但是，上海的工人同志们牢记毛主席的教导，“一月革命”的基本经验，就是无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。上海工人阶级坚持无产阶级的党性，反对资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，这一小撮坏人的阴谋破产了。
    李顺之、戚拯之流还把罪恶的黑手伸向沪宁铁路沿线的城市和农村。
    这一伙政治骗子，在苏南采用的手法，更加卑鄙可耻。他们竟敢冒充和盗用“中央文革小组工作人员”、“上海市革命委员会常委”、“上海工人革命造反总司令部”的“常委”和“顾问”等名义，到处招摇撞骗。他们就是靠这一套，在沪宁线上的常州、无锡、镇江、江阴等地，骗取了一部分群众的信任，有的当上这个组织的“参谋”，有的担任那个组织的“顾问”，有的充任“总指挥”，有的甚至同时操纵了两派革命组织。在常州，他们曾经冒充“中央文革小组工作人员”的名义，“支持”某个组织去夺旧常州市委的权；不久，又“支持”同这个组织对立的另外一些组织去夺旧常州市委的权。他们就是用这一套手法，到处煽阴风，点鬼火，极力煽动某些人的派性，制造大分裂，挑动大武斗，阴谋用这个革命组织去攻打另一个革命组织，等到两败俱伤的时候，好实现他们的反革命复辟计划。沪宁线上和苏南地区的大规模武斗，同这伙反革命分子是密切相关的。一九六七年七月，常州发生严重武斗，戚拯就守在上海铁路分局水电段的铁路专线电话机旁三天三夜，进行“遥控指挥”，并且多次召集同伙在上海开会，拟定“作战”方案。一九六七年九月，常州再次发生大规模武斗时，戚拯又通宵达旦地守在镇江火车站的专线电话机旁，对着地图进行指挥。戚拯一面和守候在上海某单位的李顺之、胡汉等保持密切联系，一面同来自常州的他的同伙召开紧急会议，想方设法搞到武器，派出“增援部队”，并且在镇江成立后勤指挥部，挑拨离间，加深某些革命群众组织的对立情绪，挑动两派继续武斗。
    这伙坏蛋，挑动武斗的手段是十分狠毒的。他们唯恐两派打不起来，唯恐群众不上他们的当，竟自煽动“先放第一枪”，煽动不要“单纯的军事防御”。李顺之在给常州一革命群众组织负责人的信中说：“这样的武斗，用不着怕犯‘先放第一枪’的错误。”“单纯的军事防御是不行的，现在看来应当进攻，可以进攻了。”这伙坏蛋就是这样煽动群众向自己的阶级兄弟开枪！
    他们还唯恐群众组织不听他们的指挥，就利用各种关系去建立自己能够直接使用的武装。李顺之在××就直接控制一个有数十支枪的“武卫连”。他还起草了一个反革命活动计划，提出要“武装一批农村小分队，每一个小分队配备机枪一挺，步枪一二十支。……另外再抽调若干连机动活动。”
    一切反动势力，总是过高地估计自己的力量，过低地估计人民的力量。他们把无产阶级的绝对优势，看成为绝对劣势。李顺之、戚拯这批狐群狗党，当他们在苏南某些城乡和上海一些革命力量薄弱地区招摇撞骗，一时蒙蔽了一些人的时候，他们是多么地利令智昏，得意忘形啊！他们在给江苏省××厅副厅长、叛徒张××的一封信中，情不自禁地道出了他们反革命的喜悦：“京（指南京）沪沿线可以说尽在我们的掌握之下了。”但是历史是无情的，曾几何时，他们就陷入了革命群众的汪洋大海，现出了牛鬼蛇神的原形，被革命群众清查出来了。
    亲爱的战友们，同志们：
    我们这里讲的只是李顺之、戚拯这么一个小集团。他们的全部罪行，上海无产阶级革命派还没有完全公布。但是，就是这些事实，还不足以发人猛醒吗？毛主席早就指出：“我们的人眼睛不亮，不善于辨别好人和坏人。我们善于辨别在正常情况之下从事活动的好人和坏人，但是我们不善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。”现在应当是擦亮眼睛的时候了。
    我们工人阶级内部，既然没有根本的利害冲突，为什么有些地方两个革命群众组织不能联合起来？为什么有的地方接二连三地出现武斗，发生流血冲突？当有人煽动我们伸出拳头打自己阶级弟兄的时候，应该多想一下，究竟为什么要打？这是谁的主意？他是个什么人？是我们的朋友，还是敌人？一定要多问几个为什么！
    当然，象李顺之、戚拯之类的坏人，只有一小撮。看不到有坏人，是错误的；认为坏人多得很，也是不符合实际的。同时，决不能因为这类坏人的黑手曾经插进某些群众组织，就不分青红皂白，把这些组织统统列入坏组织。
    要知道，李顺之、戚拯之类的坏人，是一伙反动的实用主义者。他们今天可以支持这个组织，明天又可以反对这个组织。他们所以支持或反对这个组织，完全是出于他们的反革命需要。一旦他们实现了复辟资本主义的狂妄计划，他们是会对所有的革命群众实行资产阶级的法西斯专政的。问题在于，我们有些同志，为什么会上他们的当呢？原因可以找到好多条，但是，应当坦率地说，闹资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，是一个最重要的原因。资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性是毒蛇，就是说，党内一小撮走资派、社会上的未改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，把利用革命造反派中某些人所受到的资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性的影响，当作向无产阶级进行阶级斗争的手段。特别是当着阶级敌人末日来临，一切镇压、欺骗手段失灵以后，他们象抓住稻草一样，拚命地利用我们革命队伍里面某些人的私心，恶毒地灌输派性。你要搞实力，拉队伍，树山头嘛，他就竭力为你发展人马，扩展山头，骗得你的信任。李顺之、戚拯之流，就是化装成“老造反”的毒蛇，就是用这种手段缠住了某些人。
    在这里，我们没有讲他们是怎样利用某些人的派性的。因为我们写这篇文章的目的，仅仅是举出这个小集团所干的罪恶勾当，向我们的某些仍然热衷于搞派性的战友们敲敲警钟。我们衷心地希望亲爱的战友们、同志们，仔细地回顾一下战斗的历史，为什么同一条战线上的同志，忽然对立起来了呢？难道我们共同的敌人不是党内最大的一小撮走资派、不是社会上的牛鬼蛇神，而是自己的阶级兄弟吗？难道我们不是有千条万条理由联合起来共同对敌，而没有半条理由闹分裂吗？究竟是什么东西把我们分裂了呢？难道不是资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性侵入了无产阶级革命派吗？难道不是资产阶级的黑手插进了我们无产阶级革命派吗？打倒派性！斩断黑手！无产阶级革命派联合起来！在革命斗争中，我们无产阶级失去的是锁链，得到的是整个世界！让我们用实际行动，来落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利吧！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                                                （一月十日）
