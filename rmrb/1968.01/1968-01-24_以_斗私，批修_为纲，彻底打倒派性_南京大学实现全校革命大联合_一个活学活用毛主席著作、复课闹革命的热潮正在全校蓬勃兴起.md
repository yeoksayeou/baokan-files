In the midst of the nationwide call to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and students at Nanjing University, with "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the guideline, have overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, earnestly implemented the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, and recently achieved a revolutionary great alliance throughout the university, setting an example for the revolutionary cadres and students of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City.

The university, which has achieved revolutionary great alliance, presents a new revolutionary scene. The two factions of revolutionary masses visit each other to expose their "self," have heart-to-heart talks, and replace the big-character posters that used to attack each other with red quotes from Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. A tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and resuming classes to make revolution is surging throughout the university.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the powerful driving force for Nanjing University's successful achievement of revolutionary great alliance. Chairman Mao's great call to "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" has blown like a spring breeze throughout the campus of Nanjing University. The revolutionary cadres and students' desire for great alliance has become stronger and stronger. The representatives of the two major revolutionary mass organizations first engaged in fighting self and criticizing revisionism. They reviewed their common history of struggle together, realizing that the revolutionary cadres and students of Nanjing University were able to break through the heavy encirclement of the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement and make a certain contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province, mainly because they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. Later, the long-term split was due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in their own minds, which deviated from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They deeply felt that following Chairman Mao closely, the revolution would be invincible; not following Chairman Mao closely, the revolution would suffer setbacks and even go astray.

Chairman Mao said: "The Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great alliance. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great alliance under the principle of revolution." The two major factions of Nanjing University decided to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great teachings. When there were disagreements on some specific issues of unity, both sides would conduct self-examinations and fight against the "self." They said: "We are not rebelling for the interests of individuals and small groups, but to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Everyone agreed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest and highest principles, and firmly implementing this principle is following Chairman Mao closely; otherwise, it is not following Chairman Mao closely. After full discussion and consultation, the representatives of both sides reached an agreement on "The Agreement on Achieving Revolutionary Great Alliance at Nanjing University" on November 21 of last year. On December 31 of last year, the Revolutionary Command Headquarters of the Proletarian Revolutionary Factions of Nanjing University was established, and most classes and departments also achieved revolutionary great alliance in succession. The whole university, from top to bottom, has seen a high tide of revolutionary great alliance.

After achieving revolutionary great alliance, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Nanjing University have further striven to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance. They said that to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, the most important thing is to continue to fight self and criticize revisionism, further overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and do a good job in ideological revolutionization. The Revolutionary Command Headquarters of the Proletarian Revolutionary Factions and many classes and departments have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. According to Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," they have enthusiastically carried out heart-to-heart talks in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They recalled their fighting friendship together, recalled their bitterness and sweetness together, and further aroused their class feelings. In the heart-to-heart talks, they fiercely fought against the "self" in their minds, thoroughly exposed the harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings to thoroughly defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and become proletarian revolutionary factions who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The soldiers and officers of the 6483rd Unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were sent to Nanjing University for military training, also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary factions, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, which played a very good role in further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance.

The revolutionary cadres and students of Nanjing University expressed with full confidence that they would further earnestly study and implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in revolutionary great criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school, with practical actions to promote the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination of Nanjing City and Jiangsu Province, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底打倒派性  南京大学实现全校革命大联合  一个活学活用毛主席著作、复课闹革命的热潮正在全校蓬勃兴起

    以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底打倒派性
    南京大学实现全校革命大联合
    一个活学活用毛主席著作、复课闹革命的热潮正在全校蓬勃兴起
    新华社南京二十三日电　在全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，南京大学广大无产阶级革命派以“斗私，批修”为纲，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，最近胜利地实现了全校革命大联合，为江苏省和南京市的无产阶级革命派树立了榜样。
    实现了革命大联合的南京大学出现了一派崭新的革命气象。两派革命群众互相登门亮“私”，促膝谈心，原来互相攻击的大字报换成了红彤彤的毛主席语录。毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋般地开办起来。一个活学活用毛主席著作，复课闹革命的热潮正在全校蓬勃兴起。
    毛主席的最新指示是南京大学胜利实现革命大联合的强大动力。毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，象春风一般吹遍了南大校园。革命师生要求大联合的愿望越来越强烈。两大派革命群众组织的代表首先进行了斗私批修。他们在一起回顾了共同战斗的历史，认识到南京大学无产阶级革命派在运动初期之所以能够冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重包围，为江苏省无产阶级文化大革命作出了一定的贡献，关键在于活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；以后长期分裂，是由于党内一小撮走资派的挑动和自己思想上的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，背离了毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们深深地体会到，紧跟毛主席，革命就无往而不胜；不紧跟毛主席，革命就会遭受挫折，甚至走到邪路上去。
    毛主席说：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”南京大学两大派决心遵循毛主席的伟大教导，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下联合起来。当双方在联合的一些具体问题上发生争执的时候，双方就互相作自我检查，狠斗私字。他们说：“我们不是为个人和小团体的利益造反，而是为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”大家一致认为，毛主席的最新指示是最大最大的原则，最高最高的原则，坚决贯彻这个原则，就是紧跟毛主席，否则就不是紧跟毛主席。经过充分讨论和协商，双方代表于去年十一月二十一日达成了《关于南京大学实现革命大联合的协议》。去年十二月三十一日，成立了南京大学无产阶级革命派联合指挥部，大部分班、系也相继实现革命大联合，全校从上到下出现了革命大联合的高潮。
    在实现革命大联合以后，南京大学无产阶级革命派又进一步为巩固和发展革命大联合而努力。他们说，要巩固和发展革命大联合，最重要的一条就是继续斗私批修，进一步克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，搞好思想革命化。无产阶级革命派联合指挥部和不少班系都举办了毛泽东思想学习班，他们根据毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的指示，在毛泽东思想学习班中热烈展开了谈心活动。他们在一起回忆战斗友谊，一起忆苦思甜，进一步激发了阶级感情。他们在谈心中，狠斗自己头脑中的私字，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害性，决心遵照毛主席的教导，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。人民解放军六四八三部队派到南京大学进行军训的指战员，也同广大无产阶级革命派一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，一起学习毛主席的最新指示，对于进一步巩固革命的大联合起了很好的作用。
    南京大学的革命师生满怀信心地表示，要进一步认真学习和切实执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，加强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上搞好革命的大批判，搞好革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本校的斗批改，以实际行动来推动南京市和江苏省的革命大联合和革命三结合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
