Recently, during the U.S. imperialist plot to attack the Yemeni capital, Chinese experts braved the gunfire to work alongside Yemeni workers, while the Soviet revisionist "experts" fled in panic.

New China News Agency, Sana'a, January 2—In the recent struggle against U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Yemeni Republican government, the Yemeni people have further recognized that China is the Yemeni people's true and reliable friend, while the Soviet revisionist leadership is a shameful traitor. Many Yemeni friends said, "Who is our true friend and who is our false friend? In this Yemeni incident, the people see it most clearly."

Recently, in the armed attack on the Yemeni capital Sana'a, planned by U.S. imperialism, Chinese experts working in Yemen braved the gunfire to continue working with Yemeni workers. However, the Soviet revisionist "experts" in Yemen were so frightened by the gunfire that they fled in panic. This stark contrast has had a tremendous impact on the Yemeni people.

Some said, "Look, when the shells fell on the Sana'a textile factory, the Chinese experts continued to work calmly. This is such a great support and encouragement to the Yemeni people!" Others said, "The construction of the Sana'a-Sada road, aided by China, did not stop because of the gunfire, but instead progressed day by day."

The Chinese well-digging team, which had been working continuously for over a month without rest, completed the first well amidst the gunfire. When the white water was pumped out from the ground, the nearby villagers rushed over to congratulate them, saying, "The Chinese people are truly here to help the Yemeni people."

The Chinese medical team, which had been working day and night in Ib to rescue wounded and sick soldiers from the front line, quickly dispatched a group of doctors to Sana'a when they heard that the Yemeni government wanted them to work there. The Yemeni people highly praised and commended the Chinese experts for their noble moral character. Many Yemenis would extend their thumbs up to the Chinese, saying, "The Chinese people led by the great leader Chairman Mao are truly outstanding, they are our only reliable true friends."

In contrast, as soon as the war began, the Soviet revisionist "experts," led by the Soviet embassy, fled in panic from Sana'a to Hodeidah and Taiz. The hospital in Sana'a, aided by the Soviet revisionists, was closed.

The Yemeni people expressed great indignation at the traitorous behavior of the Soviet revisionists. A Yemeni friend said, "The Soviet Union provides us with 'aid' on one hand, but colludes with our enemies on the other. In the Middle East incident, especially in this Yemeni incident, we see it more clearly. The United States uses guns and cannons to attack us, while the Soviet Union uses another method to dismantle our republic. This hidden enemy is more dangerous than the open enemy."

A Yemeni journalist said, "The Soviet Union gives us a few planes, but it does not want us to win. Because the Soviet Union stands with the United States. The Soviet Union has completely changed today, it has become a thorough and thorough modern revisionist that betrays Marxism-Leninism."

    也门人民在抗击美帝颠覆的斗争中认清苏修叛徒面目
    中国人民是也门人民的真正可靠朋友
    最近在美帝策划的对也门首都武装围攻时，中国专家冒着炮火同也门工人一道坚持工作，而苏修“专家”则逃之夭夭
    新华社萨那二日电　也门广大人民最近在抗击美帝国主义颠覆也门共和政权的斗争中，进一步认清了中国是也门人民真正可靠的朋友，而苏联修正主义领导集团是可耻的叛徒。许多也门朋友说：“谁是我们的真朋友，谁是我们的假朋友，在这次也门事件中，人民看得最清楚。”
    最近，在由美帝国主义策划的对也门首都萨那的武装围攻中，在也门工作的中国专家冒着炮火同也门工人们一道坚持工作，而在也门的苏修“专家”却被炮声吓得魂不附体，纷纷逃跑。这一鲜明的对照，在也门广大人民中引起了巨大的反响。
    有的说：“你看，当炮弹落到萨那纺织厂的时候，中国专家毫不动声色地在工厂里继续工作。这对也门人民是多么大的支持和鼓舞啊！”有的说：“由中国帮助修建的萨那—萨达公路的工程，并没有因为听到炮声而停止，而是进展得一天一个样。”
    继续工作一个多月没有休息过的中国打井队，在炮声中把第一眼井打成了。当白花花的水从地下抽出来时，附近老百姓赶来祝贺说：“中国人民是真正来帮助我们也门人民的。”
    正在伊卜城日夜不停地抢救由前线下来的也门伤病员的中国医疗队，听说也门政府要他们来萨那工作，他们很快就抽出一部分医生赶到萨那。也门人民对于中国专家这种高尚的道德品质给予了高度评价和赞扬。许多也门人遇到中国人就伸出大拇指说：“由伟大领袖毛主席领导的中国人民真是好样的，是我们唯一可靠的真正的朋友。”
    与此相反，战争一开始，苏修“专家”在苏修使馆的带头下，恐慌万状地从萨那逃到荷台达和塔伊兹。由苏修“援助”的萨那医院关门了。
    广大也门人民对苏修这种叛徒行径表示极大的愤慨。一位也门朋友说：“苏联一方面给我们‘援助’，另一方面却同我们的敌人进行勾结。在中东事件，特别是在这次也门事件中，我们看得更加清楚。美国用枪炮来打我们，而苏联却用另一种方法来拆我们共和国的台。这种隐蔽的敌人比公开的敌人更加危险。”
    一位也门新闻工作者说：“别看苏联给我们几架飞机，但是它是不喜欢我们打胜仗的，因为苏联是和美国站在一起的。苏联今天已经完全变质了，变成一个背叛马克思列宁主义的地地道道的现代修正主义了。”
