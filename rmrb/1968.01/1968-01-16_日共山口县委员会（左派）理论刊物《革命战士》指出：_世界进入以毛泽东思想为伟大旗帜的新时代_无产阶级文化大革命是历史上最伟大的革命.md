Tokyo, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- The theoretical journal "Revolutionary Warrior" of the leftist faction of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party recently published a long article by Mitsuaki Mitsuyoshi, which enthusiastically praises the great leader Chairman Mao for his brilliant, comprehensive, and creative inheritance, defense, and development of Marxism-Leninism. It extols Chairman Mao as the Lenin of our time and Mao Zedong Thought as the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The article asserts that the world has entered a magnificent new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

The article highly praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao as a beacon of light for the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world, calling it the greatest revolution in human history with epoch-making significance.

The article says: Comrade Mao Zedong has comprehensively summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and brilliantly solved, both theoretically and practically, the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, completing the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and advancing to communism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong has opened up a magnificent prospect for advancing from socialism to communism and has shown the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world a future full of light. This is a road that no one has ever taken before, and it is Comrade Mao Zedong's greatest contribution to Marxism-Leninism.

The article says: Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, comprehensively, and creatively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism's theory on class and class struggle in socialist society. He initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong, using the fundamental law of dialectics—the law of the unity of opposites—analyzed socialist society, fully expounded the class contradictions in socialist society, and clearly pointed out that class and class struggle still exist for a long time in socialist society. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In our country, although the socialist transformation has been basically completed in terms of ownership, the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended. However, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved."

The article says: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great ideological revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the importance of class struggle in the ideological field, saying, "We have already achieved basic victory in the transformation of the ownership of the means of production, but in the political and ideological fronts, we have not yet completely achieved victory. The question of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field has not been truly resolved." Whether the proletariat or the bourgeoisie wins in the ideological field is not only a matter of the fate of socialist China but also a major issue concerning the fate of the people of the whole world. The central issue of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field lies in the struggle between "public" and "private." Comrade Mao Zedong's call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" will comprehensively transform the spiritual outlook of 700 million people, greatly strengthening the ideological conditions for the transition to communism.

The article says: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a great revolutionary mass movement. In this revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong's mass line of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the masses' initiative, mobilizing the masses, and letting the masses educate themselves runs through it.

The article points out: The theory and practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the most prominent sign of the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Comrade Mao Zedong has developed the theory of class and class struggle in socialist society, proposed the theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, raised the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat to the highest level of contemporary times, and opened up the prospect of advancing to communism. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great Chinese people, with the great ambition of the proletariat, bravely tread a path that no one has ever taken before, and victoriously advance the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, building socialist China, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, into a solid state of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The article emphasizes: Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the Lenin of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolution, opening up a new era in the history of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In contemporary times, whether one loves or opposes Comrade Mao Zedong, whether one believes in or opposes Mao Zedong Thought, whether one supports or opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the most severe dividing line of whether one acknowledges or not Marxism-Leninism.

The article says: Comrade Mao Zedong led the great Chinese revolution and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory, comprehensively summed up the revolutionary struggles of China and the world, and raised Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the future of the people of the whole world. The world has entered a magnificent new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. In contemporary times, firmly supporting Mao Zedong Thought is the only guarantee for defending Marxism-Leninism and striving for the liberation of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong is a prestigious leader standing at the forefront of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Unlimited love for Comrade Mao Zedong is indispensable for uniting the will of the proletariat, seizing power, and maintaining the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The article says: The reason why Mao Zedong Thought has exerted a vigorous force among the people of the world is that it is the truth of Marxism-Leninism. The reason why the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has invigorated the hearts of the people of the whole world is that it is a great revolution. We must love Comrade Mao Zedong, unconditionally support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strive for the victory of the liberation struggle of the Japanese people.

The article says: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries who had hoped that China would change its color, and has greatly encouraged the revolutionary people of the whole world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made China, this great and unchanging world revolutionary base, as solid as steel.

The article quotes Chairman Mao's teachings to refute the anti-China fallacies of the Miyamoto group. The article points out: No matter how the Miyamoto group attacks with slander and curses, it only reflects the deep crisis of imperialism and revisionism. No one can stop the victorious tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no one can cover up the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and no one can stop the advance of the wheel of history. The attacks of the Miyamoto group are merely the desperate struggles of a doomed insect.

    日共山口县委员会（左派）理论刊物《革命战士》指出：
    世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    无产阶级文化大革命是历史上最伟大的革命
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日共山口县委员会（左派）理论刊物《革命战士》最近刊载了光冈正史的长篇文章，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席天才地、全面地、创造性地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，颂扬毛主席是当代的列宁，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，世界已进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的宏伟的革命新时代。文章盛赞毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命为全世界无产阶级和革命人民指明了光明的前途，是人类历史上具有划时代意义的最伟大的革命。
    文章说：毛泽东同志全面地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，从理论上、实践上卓越地解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命，最后完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设并发展到共产主义的问题。毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了从社会主义走向共产主义的宏伟的前景，为全世界无产阶级和革命人民指明了充满光明的前途。这是前人从未走过的道路，是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的最伟大的贡献。
    文章说：毛泽东同志天才地、全面地、创造性地继承、捍卫、发展了马克思列宁主义关于社会主义社会的阶级与阶级斗争的理论，发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。毛泽东同志以辩证法的根本规律——对立统一的规律分析了社会主义社会，全面地阐明了社会主义社会的阶级矛盾，明确指出在社会主义社会中仍然长时期地存在着阶级和阶级斗争。毛泽东同志说：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”
    文章说：无产阶级文化大革命是伟大的思想革命。毛泽东同志反复强调在意识形态方面的阶级斗争的重要性，他说，“我们已经在生产资料所有制的改造方面，取得了基本胜利，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，我们还没有完全取得胜利。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。”在意识形态方面是无产阶级取得胜利还是资产阶级取得胜利，不仅是关系到社会主义中国的命运，而且是关系到全世界人民的命运的大事。在意识形态方面无产阶级与资产阶级谁胜谁负的中心问题在于“公”和“私”的斗争。毛泽东同志提出的“要斗私，批修”这个战斗的号召，将全面地改造七亿人民的精神面貌，大大加强了向共产主义过渡的思想条件。
    文章说：无产阶级文化大革命也是伟大的革命的群众运动。在这一革命中，贯穿着相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，放手发动群众，让群众在运动中自己教育自己这条毛泽东同志的群众路线。
    文章指出：无产阶级文化大革命的理论和实践是表示马克思列宁主义发展到崭新阶段的最显著的标志。毛泽东同志发展了社会主义社会中阶级和阶级斗争的理论，提出了在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论，把无产阶级专政的理论提高到当代的最高水平，开辟了走向共产主义的前途。伟大的中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下，怀着无产阶级的雄心壮志，勇敢地走前人没有走过的道路，胜利地推进史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把占世界人口四分之一的社会主义中国建成牢固的无产阶级专政的国家。
    文章强调说：毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代的列宁。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的伟大革命，开辟了无产阶级专政历史的新纪元。在当代，对毛泽东同志是敬爱还是反对，对毛泽东思想是信仰还是反对，对无产阶级文化大革命是拥护还是反对，这是承认不承认马克思列宁主义的最严峻的分水岭。
    文章说：毛泽东同志领导伟大的中国革命和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命走向胜利，全面地总结了中国和世界的革命斗争，把马克思列宁主义提高到崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想光辉照亮全世界人民的前途。世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的宏伟的革命新时代。在当代，坚决拥护毛泽东思想，才正是捍卫马克思列宁主义，争取人民解放的唯一保证。毛泽东同志是站在世界人民革命斗争最前头的有威望的领袖。对毛泽东同志的无限敬爱，是统一无产阶级意志，夺取政权，坚持无产阶级专政所不可缺少的。
    文章说：毛泽东思想之所以在世界人民当中发挥出生气勃勃的力量，就是因为它是马列主义的真理。无产阶级文化大革命之所以振奋全世界人民的心魄，就是因为它是伟大的革命。我们就是要敬爱毛泽东同志，无条件地拥护无产阶级文化大革命，为日本人民解放斗争的胜利而奋斗。
    文章说：无产阶级文化大革命沉重地打击了把希望寄托在中国改变颜色的美帝、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派，无限地鼓舞了全世界的革命人民。无产阶级文化大革命使中国这个永不变色的巨大的世界革命根据地，巩固得象钢铁一样。
    文章引用毛主席的教导，痛斥宫本集团的反华谬论。文章指出：任凭宫本集团怎样以造谣和咒骂进行攻击，那只是反映帝国主义和修正主义的深刻危机。任何人也抵挡不住无产阶级文化大革命胜利的浪涛，任何人也遮掩不了毛泽东思想的光辉，任何人也阻挡不住历史车轮的前进。宫本集团的攻击，只不过是螳臂挡车垂死挣扎而已。
