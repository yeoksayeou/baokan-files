Factionalism serves the bourgeois political line.

Factionalism is a product of class struggle and a manifestation of class struggle in new circumstances.

The decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has forced the class enemy to adopt more covert forms to struggle against the proletariat. One important aspect of this is to use old ideological influences and habitual forces to corrupt the masses, attempting to win over hearts and minds, so as to find opportunities to stage a comeback. Within our ranks, there has always been a group of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries who lack self-awareness in ideological transformation. Today, as the Cultural Revolution deepens, in order to maintain or pursue personal or small group interests, factionalism inevitably grows, to the point of being captured and utilized by the enemy.

What class, what worldview, that is what kind of thinking style.

Proletarian revolutionaries prioritize revolutionary interests above all else, prioritize the overall interests of the proletariat above all else.

Petty-bourgeois revolutionaries, after achieving some victories and changing their status, become self-centered, and inevitably start from "me" or "my" small group, engaging in factional struggles and promoting factional activities.

Factionalism is a bourgeois thing, serving the bourgeois political line.

Factionalism is a poisonous snake, a corrosive agent in the revolutionary ranks, and an obstacle to unity against the enemy.

Factionalism is a manifestation of opportunism, fundamentally conflicting with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. "It is a negative thing, objectively aiding the enemy, ... and should not be retained in the revolutionary ranks."

Only by overcoming factionalism can we strengthen proletarian party spirit, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions; only by overcoming factionalism can we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhere to the revolutionary struggle's direction, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    派性是为资产阶级政治路线服务的
    派性是阶级斗争的产物，是阶级斗争在新形势下的表现。
    无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，迫使阶级敌人采取更加隐蔽的形式同无产阶级进行斗争。其中一个重要方面，就是利用旧的思想影响和习惯势力，腐蚀群众，妄图征服人心，以便寻找时机东山再起。而我们队伍中，本来就有一批小资产阶级革命派，对思想改造缺乏自觉性，在文化大革命深入发展的今天，为了保持、追求个人或小团体的利益，必然滋长派性，以至于为敌人所俘虏，所利用。
    什么阶级，什么世界观，就有什么样的思想作风。
    无产阶级革命派，一切以革命利益为重，一切以无产阶级的整体利益为重。
    小资产阶级革命派在斗争取得一定的胜利，地位起了变化以后，“我”字膨胀起来，就必然要一切从“我”或“我”的小团体出发，进行派别斗争，大搞派别活动。
    派性，是资产阶级的东西，是为资产阶级政治路线服务的。
    派性是条大毒蛇，是革命队伍的腐蚀剂，是团结对敌的障碍。
    派性是机会主义的一种表现，是和马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想根本冲突的。“它是消极的东西，客观上起着援助敌人的作用，……革命队伍中不应该保留它的地位。”
    只有打倒了派性，才能加强无产阶级的党性，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示；只有打倒了派性，才能紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚持革命斗争大方向，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。《浙江日报》一月八日社论
