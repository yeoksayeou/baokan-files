In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhejiang Province overfulfilled by 1.1 percent the state's cotton procurement task for 1967. The quality of the cotton procured this year is significantly better than in previous years, with the average grade improved by nearly two levels. The proportion of high-quality spinnable cotton is 83 percent, an increase of about 10 percent compared to previous years.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of Zhejiang Province resolutely carried out the great directive of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," and insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. They established the idea of farming for revolution. At the same time, they carried out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticizing the revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and the large-scale dismantling of cooperatives. This greatly raised their political consciousness and production enthusiasm. With the tenacious will of the Yugong moving mountains, they overcame the unprecedented drought that Zhejiang Province suffered last year and achieved a bumper harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: People listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the fields listen to people's words. The bumper harvest is all thanks to Chairman Mao.

In times of bounty, do not forget the state. The broad masses of community members in the cotton-producing areas resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp cotton tightly," using "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle. They correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual community members, and actively sold cotton to the state. With boundless class feelings for Chairman Mao, they picked, dried, and sold cotton simultaneously, quickly completing the cotton sales task.

Many revolutionary workers in the cotton procurement stations in the cotton-producing areas insisted on political leadership in the procurement of new cotton, strictly implementing policies, and through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, established the idea of procuring cotton for the revolution. They ensured that the scales did not stop and the procurement did not stop. Many procurement stations organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went deep into the production teams to propagate the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the community members. Many procurement stations also sent mobile procurement teams to collect cotton at the doorstep, convenience the masses, and greatly increased the enthusiasm of the community members in the cotton-producing areas to sell cotton.

    丰收不忘国家　分配突出政治
    浙江棉区社员以“斗私，批修”为纲，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系，积极向国家多交棉，交好棉
    新华社杭州九日电  在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，浙江省超额百分之一点一完成了一九六七年度国家棉花收购任务。已收购的棉花质量比往年显著提高，平均品级提高近二级，优质可纺棉占百分之八十三，比往年提高了百分之十左右。
    浙江棉区广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，树立了为革命种田的思想；同时广泛深入地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、大砍合作社等修正主义黑货，大大提高了政治觉悟和生产热情。他们以愚公移山的顽强意志，战胜了浙江去年遭到的百年不遇的大旱，夺得了好收成。广大贫下中农激动地说：人听毛主席的话，田听人的话。丰收全靠毛主席。
    丰收不忘国家。棉区广大社员坚决执行毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的伟大指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，正确处理国家、集体和社员个人三者关系，积极向国家交售棉花。他们怀着对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情，边采摘、边翻晒、边交售，迅速完成了棉花交售任务。
    棉区许多收购站的革命职工在收购新棉中，坚持政治挂帅，严格执行政策，通过活学活用毛主席著作，树立了为革命收棉的思想，做到不停秤、不停收。许多收购站组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，深入生产队向社员宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。许多收购站还派出流动收购组，上门收购，方便群众，大大提高了棉区社员售棉的积极性。
