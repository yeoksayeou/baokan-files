The ninth production brigade political squad leader Cao Yongqiu and his family, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, gathered together every night despite the day's hard work. They used the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize the "three freedoms and one contract" poison peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Cao Yongqiu, as usual, proposed the points of criticism.

	Cutting off all ties with capitalist thinking

Cao Xingsheng (Cao Yongqiu's father) denounced the harm done to him by the Chinese Khrushchev. He said: The "three freedoms and one contract" poison peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev is like mixing sugar with arsenic, sweet in the mouth but deadly in the stomach. During the three years of natural disasters, I also fell for it and took out the flower sedan chair that had been unused for several years and rented it out again. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mei Ying (Cao Yongqiu's daughter) told me a lot about breaking old habits and establishing new ones, breaking private interests and establishing public interests. She asked me to dismantle this sedan chair. At that time, I was too deeply poisoned and refused to dismantle it, so I had a falling out with her. I said to her: "You walk your way, I walk mine, each to his own." Mei Ying saw that I insisted on my mistake, so she patiently studied the "Three Articles" with me and helped me recall and compare. I really had forgotten my roots. I had personally suffered from exploitation, so why did I want to exploit others? If I continued like this, wouldn't I become corrupt, the country change color, and the world turn black? Once my mind opened up, I decided to smash this harmful sedan chair, cut off all ties with capitalist thinking, and wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path.

	People's commune is good

Cao Yongqiu was very moved after hearing his father's personal account. He said: This old counter-revolutionary, the Chinese Khrushchev, still talks nonsense about how "peasants have not benefited from the collective economy in recent years." This is sheer nonsense. We peasants think about the past, compare the present, and look to the future. The collective economy has countless benefits. For example, in 1967, there was a drought for more than a hundred days, which was the worst drought in more than twenty years. If each household had been farming individually, facing such a year, we poor and lower-middle peasants would either be separated from our families or destroyed. Now, with the people's commune as our backbone, we have overcome the drought and achieved a rare grain and cotton bumper harvest in history. Isn't this a benefit brought by the people's commune?

	Before Cao Yongqiu finished speaking, Guo Cuirong (Cao Yongqiu's mother) interjected: Chairman Mao is great, the people's commune is great. Every time we hold our bowls of white rice, we think of Chairman Mao. We will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness and will forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution.

	The fifteen-year-old Cao Mei Ying said: The Chinese Khrushchev is the backer of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. He loves capitalism and hates socialism. He opposes the people's commune, uses the "three freedoms and one contract" poison to undermine the socialist foundation, and dreams of restoring capitalism. He wants us poor and lower-middle peasants to go back on our path, suffer twice, but we will never agree. We poor and lower-middle peasants love socialism and hate capitalism. I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie," and be a good child of Chairman Mao.

    永远跟着毛主席干革命
    ——曹永球一家狠批“三自一包”黑货
    第九生产队政治队长曹永球一家，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，不顾白天的劳累，晚上围坐在一起，用毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑货。
    曹永球象往常一样提出了批判的要点。
    同资本主义思想一刀两断
    曹杏生（曹永球的父亲）控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫对他的毒害。他说：中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“三自一包”黑货，象白糖拌砒霜，吃了甜在嘴上断了肚肠。在三年自然灾害时，我也上过当，把搁置了好几年不用的花轿重新抬出来出租。在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，梅英（曹永球的女儿）给我讲了很多破旧立新、破私立公的道理，要我拆掉这顶花轿。当时我因为中毒太深，不肯拆，就同她闹翻了。我对她说：“你走你的阳关道，我走我的独木桥，大家各归各。”梅英看到我坚持错误，就耐心地和我一起学“老三篇”，帮我回忆对比。我的确忘了本，我亲身受过剥削的苦，为啥还要去剥削别人呢？照这样下去，岂不是个人要变质，国家要变色，世界要变黑了吗？思想一开窍，我就下决心打烂了这顶害人的花轿，同资本主义思想一刀两断，一心一意跟毛主席走社会主义的阳关大道。
    人民公社就是好
    曹永球听了父亲现身说法，心里很激动。他说：中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，还胡说什么：“农民这几年从集体经济中间没有得到好处。”真是混帐透顶。我们农民想想过去，比比现在，望望将来，集体经济好处多得说不完。比如一九六七年一百多天不下雨，是二十多年来从没有过的大旱。如果一家一户单干，碰到这种年成，我们贫下中农不是妻离子散，就是家破人亡。现在有了人民公社这个靠山，战胜了干旱，获得历史上少有的粮棉大丰收。难道这不是人民公社化带来的好处吗？
    没等曹永球说完，郭翠娥（曹永球的母亲）抢着说：毛主席就是好，人民公社就是好。我们每天端起白米饭碗就想起毛主席。我们要世世代代不忘毛主席的恩情，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    十五岁的曹梅英说：中国赫鲁晓夫是地富反坏右的后台老板，他爱的是资本主义，恨的是社会主义。他反对人民公社，用“三自一包”黑货来挖社会主义墙脚，破坏集体经济，梦想复辟资本主义，要我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们万万个不答应。我们贫下中农爱的是社会主义，恨的是资本主义。我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，“斗私，批修”，做毛主席的好孩子。
