More than ten thousand revolutionary railway workers in various units under the Hangzhou Railway Bureau, filled with deep class sentiments of loving the great leader Chairman Mao, have placed learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all their work as the new year begins. After the New Year's editorials from the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily* were published, they swiftly responded by convening meetings of grassroots revolutionary committees and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to repeatedly study and discuss the editorials. Many grassroots units have already started their first Mao Zedong Thought study classes for 1968.

While vigorously pushing forward the revolution, the broad masses of railway workers are also energetically ensuring the smooth operation of the railway transportation lines that run through the south and north, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. In the first four days of this year, the average daily freight volume of the entire bureau increased by more than twenty percent compared to late December last year. With Mao Zedong Thought as their banner, the broad masses of railway workers, with the attitude of masters of the state, economically use locomotives and rolling stock, actively tap into transportation potential, and use every means to save coal for the state. In recent days, the Hangzhou Locomotive Depot has loaded more and run faster on every train, increasing the freight volume by twenty-five to thirty percent without adding any more locomotives. This has fired the first shot for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution this year.

    杭州铁路分局革命生产热气腾腾
    杭州铁路分局所属各单位一万多名革命铁路工人，怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，在新的一年刚刚开始的时候，他们就把学好用好毛主席最新指示放在一切工作的首位。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论发表以后，他们闻风而动，连夜召开基层革命委员会和革命群众组织负责人会议，反复学习讨论。许多基层单位举办的一九六八年第一期毛泽东思想学习班，已陆续开学。
    广大铁路员工在狠抓革命的同时，大力抓好铁路运输工作，保证贯穿南北的浙赣线和沪杭线畅通无阻。今年头四天，全分局平均每天的货运量比去年十二月下旬增长百分之二十以上。广大铁路员工，以毛泽东思想挂帅，以国家主人翁的态度，经济使用机车车辆，积极挖掘运输潜力，千方百计为国家节约用煤。这几天，杭州机务段趟趟列车多装快跑，在不增加机车的情况下，货运量比原来增加了百分之二十五到三十，为在今年夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利打响了第一炮。
