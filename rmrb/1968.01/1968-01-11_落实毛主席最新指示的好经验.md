Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and every struggle, not just the leading cadres understand, but also the broad masses understand and grasp, is a Marxist-Leninist leadership art."

The Beijing Military Region Air Force's unit stationed in Tianjin's Hongwei District, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has, in their support-left work, widely mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions among the masses, turning them into the masses' conscious actions. Their experiences can be summarized in the following ten points:

	(1) For Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must actively study, model our actions on them, enthusiastically propagate them, and resolutely defend them. We must turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the soul of the masses and the guide for their actions. We must ensure that we implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without hesitation, follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions without falling behind, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without distortion.

	(2) Support-left work involves countless details, the situation changes constantly, and the struggle is sharp and complex. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guiding principle and obey the highest commander Chairman Mao's battle orders. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is not just a matter of work methods, but a matter of the political direction of support-left work, a fundamental stance, and an attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

	(3) For Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must act immediately and follow them closely. We must, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, convey and implement them to the revolutionary masses, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions directly accessible to the masses and ensuring that everyone understands them.

	(4) Support the left, not factions. Whatever conforms to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must resolutely support; whatever does not conform to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must criticize and educate, helping to correct it. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the misled masses, warmly helping them return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	(5) Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is not smooth sailing. We must break through all obstacles, eliminate all interference, prevent the enemy's sabotage activities; at the same time, we must overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the struggle.

	(6) Establish various advanced examples of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Use the latest instructions as a guide, use advanced examples as a path, and lead the broad masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

	(7) Struggle fiercely against selfishness, overthrow factionalism, and inspire the masses to have a revolutionary explosion in their souls, truly turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the broad masses.

	(8) Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and launch a mass movement to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We cannot just have a few red spots; we must have a vast red expanse. We must universally carry out "one helps one, one becomes red" and mutual assistance in thought activities.

	(9) Learn from the masses, honestly learn from the masses. Regularly expose our private thoughts to the masses, seek their opinions. When encountering problems, consult the masses, and if there are mistakes, publicly check them, listen to the masses' criticisms, and consciously place ourselves under the masses' supervision.

	(10) To arm the masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must first arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Support-left personnel must struggle against selfishness, criticize revisionism, and transform their worldview. We must regularly carry out "frontline rectification," using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide, through criticism and self-criticism, regularly check, summarize experiences and lessons, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. Through continuous practice and summary, we improve our understanding of the latest instructions, deepen our class feelings for the latest instructions, from not fully understanding to deeply understanding, from not consciously implementing to very consciously implementing.

    落实毛主席最新指示的好经验
    本报评论员
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”
    北京部队空军某部驻天津红卫区支左部队，遵照毛主席的教导，在支左工作中广泛发动群众，依靠群众，把毛主席的一系列最新指示落实到群众中去，变为群众的自觉行动。他们的经验，概括起来，有如下十点：
      （一）对毛主席的最新指示，要积极学习，模范执行，热情宣传，坚决捍卫，把毛主席的最新指示化为群众的灵魂，变为群众行动的指南。要做到执行毛主席的最新指示不迟疑，紧跟毛主席的最新指示不掉队，落实毛主席的最新指示不走样。
      （二）支左工作千头万绪，情况千变万化，斗争尖锐复杂，必须以毛主席的最新指示为纲，一切服从最高统帅毛主席的战斗号令。落实毛主席的最新指示，不是个工作方法问题，而是支左的政治方向问题，是根本立场问题，是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。
      （三）对毛主席的最新指示，要闻风而动，紧紧跟上，坚决照办。要以最大的热情、最快的速度，向革命群众传达贯彻，使毛主席的最新指示直接和群众见面，做到家喻户晓。
      （四）支左不支派。凡是符合毛主席最新指示的，就坚决支持；凡是不符合毛主席最新指示的，就批评教育，帮助改正。要用毛泽东思想教育受蒙蔽的群众，热情地帮助他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
      （五）落实毛主席的最新指示不是一帆风顺的。要冲破一切阻力，排除一切干扰，防止阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动；同时要克服资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性和无政府主义思潮，在斗争中落实毛主席的最新指示。
      （六）树立各种落实毛主席最新指示的先进典型。以最新指示导航，用先进典型引路，带领广大群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    （七）狠斗“私”字，打倒派性，启发群众在灵魂深处爆发革命，真正把毛主席最新指示变成广大群众的自觉行动。
    （八）相信群众，依靠群众，掀起群众性的落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。不能只红一点，要红一片。普遍开展“一帮一，一对红”和思想互助活动。
      （九）拜群众为师，老老实实向群众学习。经常向群众亮私交心，征求意见。遇事向群众请教，有错误公开检查，听取群众的批评，自觉地把自己置于群众的监督之下。
      （十）要用毛主席最新指示武装群众，首先要用毛主席最新指示武装自己。支左人员要斗私，批修，改造世界观。要定期开展“火线整风”，以毛主席最新指示为指针，通过批评和自我批评，经常检查，及时总结经验教训，坚持真理，修正错误。经过不断实践，不断总结，提高对最新指示的认识，加深对最新指示的阶级感情，由不甚理解变为深刻理解，由执行不够自觉变为非常自觉。
    他们这些经验，有普遍意义，值得我们学习。
