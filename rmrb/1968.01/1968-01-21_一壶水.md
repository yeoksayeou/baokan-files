	The eastern sky was just beginning to lighten, and the sounds of gongs, drums, cheers, and slogans filled the air. The left-supporting troops received orders from their superiors to leave Hulu Island immediately. Comrades were all stirred with emotions, unable to calm down for a long time. Having studied and fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants for over a year, they were now parting ways! An elderly poor peasant walked to the front of the formation, patting the shoulders of the comrades, reluctant to part. An elderly woman pushed her way through the crowd to the side of the soldiers, lifting her clothes to wipe her tears, and said excitedly, "We love the People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao the most!" A little friend quickly ran up to us, tightly hugging the legs of the platoon leader, and excitedly said, "Soldier uncle, I want to see Chairman Mao!" The departure whistle blew again and again, but the villagers still surrounded them, holding onto the soldiers' backpacks, unwilling to let go for a moment.

	The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association took the water bottle from the platoon leader, filled it with water from Hulu Island, and said solemnly on behalf of all the people of the island, "This is the red heart of all the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hulu Island, who love Chairman Mao and hold Mao Zedong Thought in the highest regard. Please take this jug of water back and pour it into the moat in front of Tiananmen Gate and into Zhongnanhai." The poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly instructed, "When pouring the water, be sure to sing 'Chairman Mao, the Red Sun in Our Hearts' and 'Chairman Mao, Long Live Chairman Mao Forever'!"

	We carried the villagers' boundless faith in Chairman Mao and left Hulu Island. Along the way, the platoon leader, fearing the water would evaporate, tightened the cap again and again, holding it close to his chest, and brought it back to Beijing. This is not just a jug of water, but the red heart of the entire island's people loving the Party and Chairman Mao.

	As soon as the train arrived, the platoon leader, forgetting his days of fatigue, quickly ran to Tiananmen Square. He stood on the Golden Water Bridge, looking up at the majestic Tiananmen Gate and the tall portrait of Chairman Mao, carefully took down the water bottle, and watched as drop by drop the water flowed into the moat and into Zhongnanhai.

    一壶水
    东方刚刚发白，锣鼓声、欢呼声、口号声响彻云霄，支左部队接到上级指示，马上就要离开葫芦岛了。同志们个个心潮如涌，久久不能平静。和贫下中农一起学习、战斗了十几个月，现在要分手了！贫农老大爷走到队伍的前面，拍着同志们的肩膀，依依不舍。老大娘从人群中挤到战士的身边，撩起衣襟，擦着眼泪，激动地说：“我们最爱毛主席领导的解放军！”一个小朋友，飞快地跑到我们跟前，紧紧抱住指导员的双腿，激动地要求说：“解放军叔叔，我要去见毛主席！”出发的哨声吹过一次又一次，乡亲们还是团团围住，拉着战士们的背包，一刻也不肯撒手。
    贫协主任从指导员身上取下水壶，装满葫芦岛上一壶水，代表全岛人民语重心长地说：“这是我们葫芦岛全体贫下中农无限热爱毛主席、无限崇拜毛泽东思想的红心，请你们把这壶水带回去，倒到中南海，倒进天安门前金水河里。”贫下中农再三嘱咐说：“倒水时一定要高唱《毛主席，我们心中的红太阳》、《毛主席，祝您老人家万寿无疆！》”
    我们满载乡亲们无限信仰毛主席的心情，离开了葫芦岛。一路上，指导员怕水蒸发，把盖拧了又拧，双手抱在怀里，带回了北京。这不是一壶水呀，这是全岛人民热爱党和毛主席的红心。
    一下火车，指导员忘记了几天的疲劳，飞快地向天安门前跑去，他站在金水桥上，仰望着雄伟的天安门、高大的毛主席彩色画像，小心地取下了水壶，看着一滴一滴的水流进金水河、流到中南海！　解放军某部战士　韩国光　魏少南
