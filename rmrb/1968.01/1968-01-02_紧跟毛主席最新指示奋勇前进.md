We, with boundless revolutionary fervor for our great leader Chairman Mao, have repeatedly studied the New Year's editorials from the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily*.

This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and guided by his latest instructions, has already achieved decisive great victories.

"Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." All our victories, all our achievements, and all our progress are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, the results of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

At this critical juncture of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the broad masses of the leftist revolutionaries" and came to the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory. With a loyal heart to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we resolutely smashed all the tricks and schemes of the class enemy. With fervent enthusiasm, without any hesitation, and with all our hearts, we supported the revolutionary leftists in the factory. During the days of white terror, we fearlessly faced attacks, dared to take risks, and stood firmly with the leftist masses, fighting together. Wherever the leftist masses were threatened, we appeared; wherever the leftist masses encountered difficulties, we rushed to support them. After Chairman Mao issued the call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," we carried it out resolutely. First, we conducted a great revolution within our own souls to criticize and repudiate revisionism, to smash selfishness and promote selflessness, and to criticize and repudiate the "self" and "revisionism." We also, with great political enthusiasm, helped revolutionary mass organizations establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of the revolutionary masses. After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," we copied and printed it overnight, personally delivering it to the workshops and to the homes of the workers. We also used broadcasts, blackboards, slogans, quotations, and cultural performances to widely propagate it, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are deeply imprinted in the minds of the masses as the highest guiding principle for their actions. We seriously implemented the principle of "supporting the left without supporting any faction," conducting in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. We helped the revolutionary masses overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and quickly achieve revolutionary great unity among the several revolutionary mass organizations in the factory, and established a revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the beacon guiding the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country to march forward with great vigor. They are the most powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The New Year's editorial pointed out, "The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In the brilliant year of 1968, we are determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to implement them one hundred percent, to fully implement them, and to be models in studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We will resolutely do the following: "If Chairman Mao loves it, I love it; if Chairman Mao supports it, I support it; if Chairman Mao instructs it, I carry it out; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward." We will make new contributions to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization, and continuously achieve new merits for the people.

    紧跟毛主席最新指示奋勇前进
    支左爱民模范排
    我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的革命激情，反复学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论。
    这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，已经取得了决定性的伟大胜利。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们的一切胜利，一切成就，一切进步，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都是毛主席最新指示指引的结果。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战关头，我们响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，来到江西棉纺织印染厂。我们怀着对毛主席革命路线的一颗忠心，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，满腔热情地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持厂里的革命左派。在那白色恐怖的日子里，我们不怕围攻，敢担风险，坚定不移地和左派群众团结、战斗在一起，哪里左派群众受威胁，我们就出现在哪里；哪里左派群众遇到困难，我们就赶到哪里去支援。毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召后，我们坚决照办，首先在我们自己灵魂深处进行了一场破私立公的大革命，狠斗“私”字，猛批“修”字，大立“公”字；同时以极大的政治热情，帮助革命群众组织大办毛泽东思想学习班，大大促进了革命群众的思想革命化。伟大领袖毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们连夜抄写翻印，亲自送到车间，送到工人家里，并且运用广播、黑板报、标语、语录牌、文艺节目等形式广泛进行宣传，让毛主席的最新指示深深地印在群众的脑子里，作为指导自己的行动的最高准则。我们认真执行“支左不支派”的原则，进行深入、细致的思想政治工作，帮助革命群众克服资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，使这个厂的几个革命群众组织很快实现了革命的大联合，并且成立了革命委员会。
    毛主席的最新指示，是指引全党、全军、全国人民奋勇前进的灯塔，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最新最强大的思想武器。元旦社论指出，“毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。”在光辉灿烂的一九六八年，我们决心紧跟毛主席的最新指示，百分之百地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，作学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。坚决做到：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”为从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新的贡献，为人民不断立新功。
