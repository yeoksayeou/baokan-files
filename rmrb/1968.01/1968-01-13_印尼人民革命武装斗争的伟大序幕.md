Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle against the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution is breaking through numerous difficulties and gradually deepening. Indonesian communists are moving from cities to the countryside, mobilizing the peasant masses, establishing revolutionary armed forces, and creating red base areas to prepare for a prolonged armed struggle.

Currently, the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle have spread to the main islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra. In particular, in West Kalimantan, the revolutionary forces have a considerable number of armed people. They unite the broad masses, adopt flexible strategies and tactics, utilize favorable terrain, and repeatedly foil the reactionary military and police "encirclement and suppression," striking heavy blows against the enemy. In this vast mountainous and forested area of West Kalimantan, the people's guerrilla forces are creating revolutionary base areas. The development of the revolutionary armed struggle in West Kalimantan has brought great encouragement and hope to the Indonesian revolutionary people.

More than two years ago, the Indonesian fascist military clique led by Suharto-Nasution, under the auspices of American imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary coup and seized power. In just over two years, they have slaughtered hundreds of thousands of communists and revolutionary people, imprisoned tens of thousands of outstanding Indonesian youth, and turned the entire Indonesia into a living hell. The Indonesian reactionaries arrogantly attempt to drown the revolution in blood. However, the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied suppression only accelerates the awakening of the Indonesian people and the development of the Indonesian revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are invincible." The Indonesian reality vividly confirms this great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao. Under the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied slaughter, the revolutionary communists and people have not been frightened or conquered. They have risen from the bloodshed, buried their comrades' bodies, and begun a new great struggle. Indonesian communists and revolutionary people have taken up arms and embarked on the path of armed struggle. The Indonesian revolutionary forces are not becoming smaller but larger. The flames of the Indonesian people's armed struggle will surely burn the Indonesian reactionaries to ashes.

In the long-term revolutionary struggle, Indonesian communists and revolutionary people have learned through investigation and research that the reactionaries hold knives, and the revolutionary people must also take up knives. If the revolutionary people want to resist the reactionaries' bloody suppression and strive for their liberation, they must use armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution. This is the only correct path for the Indonesian revolution.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is the representative of the Indonesian big landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie, and the faithful running dogs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. After this reactionary military clique came to power, it carried out brutal white terror domestically, frenziedly plundering and looting the people, causing Indonesia's economy to fall into unprecedented chaos and collapse; it sold out national sovereignty and national interests abroad, begging for the leftovers from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, making Indonesia return to the miserable path of colonialism. Today, in Indonesia, the treasury is exhausted, debts are piling up, famine is severe, prices are soaring, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people nationwide is about eighteen million. Workers and peasants are in dire straits. The petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie have no way out. The national contradictions between the Indonesian people and imperialism, and the class contradictions within Indonesia, are unprecedentedly sharpened. The internal struggles for power and profit within the Suharto-Nasution clique are also intensifying. The entire Indonesia is in a state of great turmoil. The country is full of dry wood. A revolutionary upsurge against the Suharto-Nasution fascist rule will surely come, and the sparks of the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle will surely develop into a raging inferno.

The Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle has just begun. On the revolutionary path, it is inevitable that various difficulties and twists and turns will be encountered. However, revolutionary forces have always grown and strengthened in the fire of struggle and tempered in the storm of revolutionary struggle. As long as Indonesian communists and revolutionary people firmly grasp the gun, go deep into the countryside, establish rural base areas, rely on and mobilize the peasants, carry out land revolution and guerrilla warfare, use correct strategies and tactics, and persist in long-term struggle, they will surely be able to grow from small to large and from weak to strong, use the countryside to encircle the cities, and ultimately seize the cities and win nationwide victory.

Let the flames of armed revolution on Indonesian soil burn more fiercely! The final victory will surely belong to the Indonesian revolutionary people!

    印尼人民革命武装斗争的伟大序幕
    本报评论员
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，印度尼西亚人民反抗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的革命武装斗争，正在冲破重重困难，逐步地深入发展。印尼共产党人从城市转入农村，发动农民群众，建立革命武装力量，开创红色根据地，准备坚持长期的武装斗争。
    目前，印尼人民革命武装斗争的烽火，已经蔓延到爪哇、加里曼丹、苏拉威西和苏门答腊等主要岛屿。特别是在西加里曼丹，革命力量拥有一支相当规模的人民武装。他们团结广大群众，采用机动灵活的战略战术，利用有利的地形，不断地粉碎反动军警的“围剿”，狠狠地打击了敌人。在西加里曼丹这个山高林密的广大地带，人民游击队正在创建革命根据地。西加里曼丹革命武装斗争的发展，为印尼革命人民带来了巨大的鼓舞和希望。
    两年多以前，以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人集团，在美帝国主义的策划下，发动反革命政变，攫取了政权。他们在短短两年多时间内，屠杀了几十万共产党人和革命人民，把几十万印尼优秀儿女投入监牢，把整个印尼变成一座人间地狱。印尼反动派妄图用这种野蛮的手段，把革命淹没在血泊里。但是，印尼反动派的疯狂镇压，只能促使印尼人民的迅速觉醒和印尼革命的加速发展。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    印尼活生生的现实，又一次证实了毛主席指出的这一伟大的真理。在印尼反动派的疯狂屠杀之下，革命的共产党人和革命人民并没有被吓倒，被征服，他们从血泊中站了起来，掩埋好同伴的尸体，开始了新的伟大的战斗。印尼共产党人和革命人民拿起了武器，走上了武装斗争的道路。印尼的革命力量不是越来越小，而是越来越大。印尼人民的武装斗争的烈火必将把印尼反动派烧成灰烬。
    印尼共产党人和革命人民，在长期的革命斗争实践中，经过调查研究懂得，反动派的手里拿着刀，革命人民也要拿起刀。革命人民如要反抗反动派的血腥镇压，争取自己的解放，就必须用武装的革命去反对武装的反革命。这是印尼革命的唯一正确的道路。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，是印尼大地主阶级、官僚买办资产阶级的总代表，是美帝、苏修的忠实走狗。这个反动军人集团上台以后，对内实行残暴的白色恐怖，疯狂洗劫和掠夺人民，使印尼经济陷于空前大混乱和大破产；对外出卖国家主权和民族利益，讨取美帝、苏修的残羹剩饭，使印尼重新回到殖民地的悲惨老路。在今天的印尼，财政枯竭，外债累累，饥荒严重，物价暴涨，全国失业半失业人数约达一千八百万。工人和农民处于水深火热之中。小资产阶级和民族资产阶级也没有出路。印尼人民同帝国主义之间的民族矛盾，印尼国内的阶级矛盾，都空前激化。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安集团内部的勾心斗角、争权夺利的斗争也日益加剧。整个印尼处在一种惶惶不可终日的局面之下。全国布满了干柴。一个反抗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯统治的革命高潮必将到来，印尼人民的革命武装斗争的星星之火，必将发展成为燎原之势。
    印尼人民武装革命斗争还刚刚开始。在革命的征途上，不可避免地会遇到各种各样的困难，出现各种各样的曲折。但是，革命的力量从来都是在斗争的烈火中发展壮大，在革命斗争的大风浪中锻炼成长的。只要印尼共产党人和革命人民紧握枪杆子，深入农村，建立农村根据地，依靠和发动农民，开展土地革命和游击战争，运用正确的战略战术，坚持长期斗争，就一定能够由小到大，由弱变强，用农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，赢得全国的胜利。
    让印度尼西亚土地上武装革命的烈火更猛烈地燃烧吧！最后胜利一定属于印尼的革命人民！
