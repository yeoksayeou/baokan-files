	Editor's Note: Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." To build such a vanguard organization of the proletariat, we must take Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental guiding ideology of the Party, use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks for educating Party members, and launch a mass movement among Party members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

	The guiding ideology of the Party determines the fundamental direction of Party building. The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposes taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of our Party and opposes using Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks for educating Party members. Instead, he wants to use his infamous "Cultivation" as the Party member's textbook, using his bourgeois, decadent worldview of "suffering small losses to gain big advantages" to corrupt Party members. His purpose is to implement his revisionist line of building the Party, to change the nature of the Party, and to attempt to turn our Party into a revisionist, fascist party, serving his goal of restoring capitalism in China. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary masses must seriously study Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the Party, use Chairman Mao's theory of building the Party as a weapon, and launch a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the Party, completely eliminating its poisonous influence.

	Here, we publish some articles written by representatives of the Second Artillery's Study of Chairman Mao's Works who attended the conference, criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the Party. We must firmly adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the sole guiding ideology of the Party, rectify the Party organization, and strengthen Party building.

    第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表大批判文选
    编者按：毛主席最近指示我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”要建设这样的无产阶级先锋队组织，就要以毛泽东思想作为党的根本指导思想，把毛主席著作作为教育党员的基本教材，在党员中开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。
    党的指导思想，决定着党的建设的根本方向。中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对以毛泽东思想为我党的指导思想，反对把毛主席著作作为教育党员的基本教材，而要把他的臭名昭著的《修养》作为党员教材，用他那套“吃小亏占大便宜”的资产阶级的腐朽世界观腐蚀党员，其目的就是要推行他的修正主义的建党路线，来改变党的性质，妄图使我们党变成修正主义的党、法西斯党，为他在中国复辟资本主义服务。这是我们绝对不能容许的。我们每个共产党员和广大革命群众都要认真学习毛主席的无产阶级的建党路线，以毛主席的建党理论为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线进行大批判，彻底肃清它的流毒。
    这里发表的，是出席第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表写的批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的文章。我们要坚定不移地以毛泽东思想为党的唯一指导思想，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。
