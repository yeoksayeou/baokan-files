The only way to thoroughly eliminate factionalism is to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The two sides should speak less about each other's faults and errors, let others speak about their own faults and errors, and each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences."

To achieve this, one must adhere to the principle of "being strict with friends and lenient with strangers."

Being strict with friends means that the closer the comrades are, the more one should demand of them using Mao Zedong Thought. If faults and errors are discovered, they should be seriously criticized and educated, without indulgence, tolerance, or covering up faults. The closer the friends, the more one should adhere to principles. Only in this way can decadent and vulgar tendencies be prevented.

Being lenient with strangers means that with more distant comrades, with the revolutionary masses of the other side, one should not pick on every little thing, should not "pour cold water," or exaggerate faults and errors! Let others speak about their own faults and errors, learn to seek common ground while reserving differences, and be good at uniting with comrades who have different opinions to jointly fight the enemy. This is not about advocating "loyalty and forgiveness," but the correct way to handle internal contradictions within the revolutionary ranks.

However, those with serious factionalism do the opposite. They are lenient with friends and strict with strangers. They cover up and whitewash the faults and errors of their own side, allowing them to run wild, and always protect their own. As a result, they harm comrades and shield the bad elements. While they seize on every little fault and error of the other side, exaggerating them to the extreme! They even rejoice in the misfortunes of others and kick them while they are down. They do not see that they are sliding into a very dangerous abyss. This way of doing things completely confuses the two types of contradictions, deviates from the correct direction of struggle, and can only benefit the enemy.

Within the revolutionary ranks, adhering to the principle of "being strict with friends and lenient with strangers" is a manifestation of proletarian party spirit. Doing so can "start from the principle that the interests of the party are above personal and local interests, and achieve complete unity and solidarity of the party."

As for the bad elements using factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to interfere, disrupt the class line, it is not a matter of being strict or lenient. All revolutionary mass organizations must resolutely expose this handful of bad elements, unite to jointly criticize and struggle against them, and cut off their black hands.

### 亲者严疏者宽

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    亲者严疏者宽
    彻底清除派性的办法，别无他途，只有按照毛主席的最新指示办事：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”
    要做到这些，必须坚持“亲者严、疏者宽”的原则。
    亲者严，这就是说，越是较亲近的同志，越是自己组织内的战友，就越要用毛泽东思想严格要求。发现了缺点、错误，要严肃地进行批评教育，不要姑息，不要纵容，不要隐恶扬善。越是亲者越要坚持原则。这样，腐朽庸俗的作风才不至于发生。
    疏者宽，这就是说，对较疏远的同志，对另一方组织的革命群众，不要尽找岔子，不要“倾盆大雨”，不要无限上“纲”！别人的缺点、错误，让别人自己去讲，学会求大同，存小异，要善于团结不同意见的同志共同对敌。这决不是讲什么“忠恕”之道，而是处理革命队伍内部矛盾的正确途径。
    可是派性严重的人，却反其道而行之。他们是亲者宽，疏者严。对自己一方的缺点、错误，遮遮盖盖，涂涂抹抹，自由放任，一味护短，结果既害了同志，更包庇了坏人。而对对方的缺点、错误，则抓住一点，尽量夸大，无限上“纲”！甚至幸灾乐祸，落井下石。他们看不见自己正朝着一个极其危险的深渊滑下去。这样搞法，完全混淆了两类矛盾，背离了斗争大方向，只能有利于敌人。
    在革命队伍内，坚持“亲者严、疏者宽”的原则，这是无产阶级党性的表现。这样做，就能“以党的利益高于个人和局部的利益为出发点，使党达到完全团结统一的地步。”
    至于坏人利用革命队伍内的派性，插入黑手，搅乱阶级阵线，那就不是一个严或宽的问题了。各革命群众组织要坚决把这一小撮坏人揪出来，联合起来共同批斗，斩断他们的黑手。
