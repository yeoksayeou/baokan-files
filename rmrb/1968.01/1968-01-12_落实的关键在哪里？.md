On the eve of the first anniversary of the great "January Revolution," the PLA troops stationed in Shanghai summarized their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives during the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work.

Their experiences tell us that the attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest directives is a fundamental issue. The key to implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives lies in having an unlimited love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's latest directives; in believing that Chairman Mao's words have the greatest power, in believing that the broad revolutionary masses listen most to Chairman Mao's words, and in believing that by following Chairman Mao's directives, we can definitely gain the trust and support of the masses and definitely accomplish the tasks of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries."

It is precisely because of adopting this attitude that they regard the popularization and dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the enthusiastic and rapid propagation of Chairman Mao's latest directives as the fundamental task of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. They regard the implementation of every aspect of Chairman Mao's latest directives as the highest duty of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" personnel.

In this way, they can focus on the essentials without being distracted by numerous issues, wholeheartedly grasp the fundamentals, persist in arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest directives take deep root in the hearts of the masses. In any complex situation, they can maintain a clear mind, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, frustrate the enemy's plots and sabotage activities, and eliminate interference and impact from both the right and the ultra-"left," ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the task of changing both the objective world and their own subjective world."

To implement Chairman Mao's latest directives among the masses, we must first implement them in our own minds.

We should, like the PLA troops stationed in Shanghai, strictly demand of ourselves, voluntarily examine ourselves, and see if we:

Have a firm political stance of being unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line;

Have a high level of political enthusiasm for promptly propagating and executing Chairman Mao's latest directives;

Have a strong revolutionary will to defend Chairman Mao's latest directives;

Have a strict spirit of self-criticism in constantly comparing ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest directives;

Have an attitude of humbly learning from the proletarian revolutionaries.

If we truly do this, Chairman Mao's latest directives can be fully and comprehensively implemented, and the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be guaranteed.

    落实的关键在哪里？
    本报评论员
    在伟大“一月革命”风暴一周年的前夕，人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军指战员，总结了在“三支”“两军”工作中落实毛主席最新指示的经验。
    他们的经验告诉我们，对毛主席的最新指示抱什么态度，是一个根本的问题。落实毛主席最新指示的关键，就在于对伟大领袖毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的最新指示，无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜；坚信毛主席的话威力最大，坚信广大革命群众最听毛主席的话，坚信按毛主席的指示办事，就一定能得到广大群众的信任和支持，一定能胜利完成“三支”“两军”的任务。
    正由于采取这种态度，他们把普及、传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想，热情、迅速地宣传毛主席的最新指示，作为“三支”“两军”工作的根本任务，把条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示作为“三支”“两军”人员的最高职责。
    这样，他们就能够做到千头万绪不转向，一心一意抓根本，坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众，大办毛泽东思想学习班，让毛主席最新指示在群众心坎里深深扎根；在任何复杂的情况下，始终保持清醒的头脑，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰和冲击，保证毛主席最新指示的落实。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界”。
    要让毛主席的最新指示在群众中落实，首先要在自己的头脑里落实。
    我们要象驻上海三军指战员那样，严格地要求自己，自觉地检查自己，看看自己：
    是不是具有无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚定政治立场；
    是不是具有雷厉风行宣传和执行毛主席最新指示的饱满政治热情；
    是不是具有勇敢捍卫毛主席最新指示的坚强革命意志；
    是不是具有时时对照毛主席最新指示检查自己的严格的自我批评精神；
    是不是具有向无产阶级革命派虚心学习的态度。
    果真这样做了，毛主席的最新指示就能够条条落实，全面落实，无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就有最可靠的保证。
