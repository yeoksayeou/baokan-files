Japanese revolutionary people are enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech on supporting the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic, and just struggle. They have expressed their determination to hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism and to strive for the victory of the Japanese revolution. The Ryoemon group's attempt to sabotage the unity of the peoples of China and Japan is doomed to failure.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated January 27, revolutionary people from various parts of Tokyo have recently held discussion meetings and made speeches, enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of the publication of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao's speech, "In Support of the Japanese People's Anti-American, Patriotic, Just Struggle" (January 27). They have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and to fight for the victory of the Japanese revolution.

A female worker from the "Long Weekly News" said at a youth discussion meeting in Yamaguchi Prefecture: "Today, re-reading Chairman Mao's great speech makes one feel even more the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: 'The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long.' This is the greatest encouragement to the Japanese people. The anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is developing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Through various anti-American, patriotic struggles, the Japanese people have deeply felt the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought."

A female printer from Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "In his speech, Chairman Mao taught: 'The anti-imperialist, anti-American struggle of the Japanese people of all classes is continuously expanding. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic struggle.' Chairman Mao's teaching has shown us the road to victory. We should conscientiously carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and establish a genuine, broad anti-American, patriotic united front. Only in this way can we guarantee the victory of the struggle." Another young printer from Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "Chairman Mao said: 'The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Japanese people.' Facts have proved that the support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Japanese people is the most resolute. Socialist China is a powerful bastion of the world's revolutionary people. The Ryoemon revisionist group's malicious slander of the Chinese people and attempt to sabotage the unity of the peoples of China and Japan are doomed to failure."

Tokyo worker Takeo Takeda said: "Today's revolutionary situation in Japan proves that Chairman Mao's speech four years ago is completely correct. Takeo said: 'To carry the anti-American, patriotic struggle to final victory, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings.'

A young member of the Japanese revolutionary theater group, Shintaro Shino, said: "The recent surge in the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialist nuclear ships fully proves that the anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is developing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. It also proves that the Japanese people will definitely be able to drive the American imperialists out of their country according to Chairman Mao's teachings."

    日本革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席谈话发表四周年
    决心高举反帝反修旗帜夺取革命胜利
    宫本集团妄图破坏中日两国人民团结只能是枉费心机
    据新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：日本各地革命人民，满怀革命激情，最近纷纷举行座谈会和发表谈话，热烈欢呼世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表四周年（一月二十七日）。他们表示决心按照毛主席的教导，高举反帝反修的旗帜，为日本革命的胜利而斗争。
    《长周新闻》的一位女工作人员在山口县各界青年座谈会上说：今天重读毛主席的这个伟大的谈话，使人越发感到毛泽东思想的伟大。毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这是对日本人民的最大的鼓励。日本人民的反美爱国斗争正沿着毛主席指出的方向发展。通过历次反美爱国斗争，日本人民更加深刻地体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    山口县一位印刷女工说：毛主席在谈话中教导说：“日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线不断地扩大。这是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”毛主席的这一教导给我们指明了胜利的道路。我们应当切实贯彻毛主席这一指示，建立真正的广泛的反美爱国统一战线。只有这样，才能保证斗争的胜利。山口县另一位青年印刷工人说：毛主席说：“中国人民衷心地支持日本人民的正义斗争。”事实证明，中国人民支持日本人民的斗争是最坚决的。社会主义的中国是世界人民革命的强大堡垒。宫本修正主义集团恣意诽谤中国人民，企图破坏中日两国人民的团结，是枉费心机的。
    东京工人竹田有二说，今天日本的革命形势证明了毛主席四年前的谈话是完全正确的。竹田说：为了把反美爱国斗争进行到最后胜利，我们必须认真学习毛主席的教导。
    日本革命剧团齿轮座的青年团员篠田胜之说：“最近日本人民反对美帝核舰只斗争的高涨，充分证明了日本人民的反美爱国斗争正在按照毛主席指引的方向发展。同时也证明了日本人民一定能够按照毛主席的教导把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去。”
