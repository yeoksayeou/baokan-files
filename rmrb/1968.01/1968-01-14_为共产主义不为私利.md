For Communism, Not for Personal Gain

A certain aviation school's political instructor, Xue Jiazhi

Chinese Khrushchev, wherever he goes, spews out the stench of money, shouting slogans like, "Proper distribution makes everyone work happily," "We need to educate and persuade workers, there will be rewards in the future," and even blatantly saying, "Material incentives are still needed!" "First, feed you full, if you don't work hard, then you can criticize." Chinese Khrushchev opens his mouth to talk about "money" and closes it to talk about "rewards." These are the sugar-coated bullets he fires at the revolutionary people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is for the people, and it works wholeheartedly for the people's interests." The revolutionary soldiers trained by Chairman Mao have only revolution in their hearts: two eyes always looking towards the great cause of communism, two hands always doing things for the people, and two feet always walking the revolutionary path. We do not consider material enjoyment at all. As Comrade Lei Feng said, "We live to make revolution," "not to eat." Countless revolutionary martyrs and selfless communists, in the revolutionary struggle, bravely charge forward, fighting to the death, not for personal "rewards," but for the victory of the revolution and the liberation of humanity. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fighting on various fronts, enduring countless hardships, not for personal "rewards," but for the victory of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

A true revolutionary should unconditionally dedicate everything to the revolutionary cause. Over the years, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, I have overcome selfishness and established public-mindedness, reformed my worldview, and cultivated a frugal style. I have used my savings to support the places where the Party and the people need them. Over the past two years, I have often bought Chairman Mao's works and portraits to give to Red Guards and the people, and I have also supported the construction of people's communes. All this is something that the thoroughly revisionist Chinese Khrushchev cannot understand. However, in our view as revolutionary soldiers, wholeheartedly serving the people, being selfless, and dedicating ourselves to the revolution, this is our purpose in working, and there is nothing else but personal interests and motives. For the revolution and the people, "selflessly, actively, and diligently," "selflessly and devotedly," "working hard and humbly," this is the greatest happiness and greatest joy for the revolutionary soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Chinese Khrushchev attempts to use money and material things to lure us onto the revisionist path, aiming to restore capitalism, which is a futile attempt. The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have long seen through his reactionary nature. We must take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, firmly establish the worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

### 为共产主义不为私利

    为共产主义不为私利
    某航校警通连指导员  薛家治
    中国赫鲁晓夫走到那里就张开大嘴喷出铜臭熏天的毒液，叫嚷什么：“分配得当，大家就精神愉快地工作”，“要教育说服工人，将来会有酬劳的”，甚至公然说：“物质刺激还是要一点罗！”“先给你吃饱，你不好好工作，就好批评。”中国赫鲁晓夫开口一个“钱”，闭口一个“酬劳”，这是他射向革命人民的糖衣炮弹。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席教导出来的革命战士，心里只有革命二字：两只眼永远看着共产主义大方向，两只手永远做为人民服务的事，两只脚永远走革命的路。我们根本不考虑物质生活享受。正如雷锋同志所说的：我们“活着干革命”，“决不是为了吃饭”。无数革命先烈，和一心为公的共产主义新人，在革命斗争中赴汤蹈火，冲锋陷阵，前赴后继，英勇牺牲，绝对不是为了取得个人的什么“酬劳”，而是为了革命的胜利，人类的解放。广大工农兵群众战斗在各条战线上，历尽千辛万苦，绝对不是为了个人的什么“酬劳”，而是为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利。
    一个真正的革命者，就应该无条件地把自己的一切献给革命事业。几年来，我通过活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，改造世界观，树立了艰苦朴素的作风，把节余下来的钱用到党和人民需要的地方去。两年来，我经常买一些毛主席著作和毛主席像送给红卫兵和人民群众，还经常支援人民公社建设。这一切是“修”到家的中国赫鲁晓夫所不能理解的，然而在我们革命战士看来，全心全意为人民服务，一心为公，一心为革命，这就是我们革命战士工作的目的，除此之外，再也没有什么个人的利益和动机。为革命为人民“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”，就是毛主席的革命战士的最大幸福，最大愉快。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用金钱、物质把我们引诱到修正主义的邪道上去，达到复辟资本主义的目的，这完全是痴心妄想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵早看透了他的反动本质。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，牢牢地树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的共产主义世界观。（附图片）
