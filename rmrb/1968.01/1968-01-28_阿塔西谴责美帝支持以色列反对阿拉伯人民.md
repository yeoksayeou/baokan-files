According to Xinhua News Agency in Damascus on the 25th, Syrian Head of State Ataasi on the 25th denounced the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy of supporting Israel against the Arab people and expressed the determination to recover the occupied lands through armed struggle.

Ataasi said: "The United States, which supported the June aggression, is continuing to support Israel in staying on the territories it has occupied." He added, "Johnson's conspiracy to support Israel is known to the world, and everyone knows the relationship between Israel and the United States." He said: Our people are determined to resist the aggression of the Zionists and to foil the conspiracies of the United States and the Zionists.

He also said: "The Palestinian Arabs will never stand idly by while their homeland is occupied, their land is plundered, and their dignity is violated."

He pointed out that in the struggle against Zionism, attention must be paid to those who participate in the imperialist conspiracies in this region and sabotage the actions taken by the Arab people to deal with the increasing danger of Zionism.

    阿塔西谴责美帝支持以色列反对阿拉伯人民
    据新华社大马士革二十五日电　叙利亚国家元首阿塔西二十五日谴责美帝国主义支持以色列反对阿拉伯人民的阴谋，并表示决心用武装斗争收复被占领的土地。
    阿塔西说：“支持（以色列）六月侵略的美国，正在继续支持以色列赖在被它占领的领土上”。约翰逊“支持以色列的阴谋，全世界都知道以色列同美国的关系。”他说：我国人民决心抵抗犹太复国主义者的侵略，挫败美国和犹太复国主义者的阴谋。
    他还说：“巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人决不会对占领他们祖国、掠夺他们土地和侵犯他们尊严的行为袖手旁观。”
    他指出，在反对犹太复国主义的斗争中，必须注意那些参与帝国主义在这个地区搞阴谋的人破坏阿拉伯人民为对付日益增长的犹太复国主义的危险而采取的行动。
