The people's revolutionary armed forces active in the mountainous regions of West Kalimantan have, over the past half year, held high the banner of armed revolution. Despite being surrounded by tens of thousands of enemy troops in a perilous environment, they have remained steadfast, persisted in guerrilla warfare, and repeatedly repulsed the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the fascist military forces of Suharto and Nasution. Their achievements are outstanding.

According to reports, since last July, the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan launched a surprise attack on the airbase at Mampuang on the western coast of West Kalimantan, which is controlled by the fascist military group of Suharto and Nasution. After achieving victory in their first battle, over the past half year, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have employed flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, achieved surprising victories, and engaged in numerous battles with the reactionary military forces, which outnumbered and were better equipped than them, in their counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression."

The reactionary newspapers in Jakarta revealed that during this period, this revolutionary armed force engaged in more than forty battles with the "elite" 2nd Battalion of the Silivangji Division of Suharto and Nasution's fascist military forces. The reactionary officers openly admitted that they were "hardly able to defend themselves" against the people's revolutionary armed forces. The Jakarta *Social Messenger* reported that last July, a company of reactionary troops was surrounded by the people's revolutionary armed forces in the Nyut Mountain area of West Kalimantan and suffered heavy losses. Another report stated that in late November of last year, another company of reactionary troops was surrounded by the people's revolutionary armed forces in the mountainous area east of Menggayang. The people's revolutionary armed forces launched a fierce attack from the mountains above, inflicting heavy casualties on the besieged reactionary troops below. The reactionary newspapers in Jakarta exclaimed: "The challenges from the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan are becoming increasingly blatant." These reactionary newspapers have been constantly complaining: due to the support of the people and the use of strategies and tactics based on "Mao Zedong's teachings," the reactionary military forces' advantages in technology and equipment have "completely lost their significance," making it difficult for them to deal with the people's revolutionary armed forces.

While engaged in intense battles, the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan place great importance on educating the local people with Mao Zedong Thought. The reactionary newspapers in Jakarta reported that this revolutionary armed force has established "Mao Zedong Works Study Groups" within its ranks and has been "widely spreading Mao Zedong's communist teachings" among the local populace. They also post Communist Party slogans in the villages to propagate among the residents and distribute leaflets, calling on the people to rise up against imperialism led by the United States and the fascist regime of Suharto and Nasution.

The revolutionary armed struggle of the people of West Kalimantan has been warmly welcomed and supported by the people of Indonesia nationwide. According to the Antara News Agency, recently in the capital of Central Java, Semarang, leaflets distributed by local revolutionaries have appeared. The leaflets enthusiastically hail the victorious development of the people's revolutionary armed struggle in West Kalimantan and call on the people of Indonesia nationwide to rise up and overthrow the fascist regime of Suharto and Nasution.

The fascist regime of Suharto and Nasution is extremely terrified of the development of the people's revolutionary armed struggle in West Kalimantan and its revolutionary influence on the entire country. According to the Associated Press, this fascist regime recently held a full cabinet meeting to discuss the issue of "encirclement and suppression" of the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan. This meeting was "primarily concerned" with the development of the "communist movement" in Indonesia and was "anxious" about it.

The people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan face an extremely arduous combat mission. However, the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan are brave fighters who dare to struggle. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the support of the local and national people, they will, in the long and arduous journey of armed revolution, surely shatter the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" step by step and achieve new victories.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下　高举武装斗争红旗坚持游击战争
    印尼西加里曼丹人民革命武装  粉碎反革命“围剿”取得新胜利
    据新华社十一日讯　活跃在西加里曼丹山区的印尼人民革命武装，半年来高举武装革命的红旗，在敌军围困万千重的险恶环境下岿然不动，坚持游击战争，不断地反击了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军队的反革命“围剿”，战绩卓著。
    据报道，西加里曼丹人民革命武装从去年七月奇袭苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团设在西加里曼丹西海岸的山口洋空军基地，首战告捷后，半年以来，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，运用灵活机动的战略战术，出奇制胜，同前来进行反革命“围剿”的在人数上和装备上处于优势的反动军队进行了多次的战斗。雅加达反动报纸透露，在这个期间，这支人民革命武装仅同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军队的“王牌军”西利万吉师第二库章营作战即达四十多次。这个营的反动军官公开承认，他们被人民革命武装打得“几乎无法招架”。雅加达《社会使者报》报道，去年七月，反动军队一个连在西加里曼丹的尼尤特山区陷入人民革命武装的重围，被打得焦头烂额。另据报道，反动军队的另一个连在去年十一月下旬，又被人民革命武装包围在孟加影以东的山区，人民革命武装从山上猛打被困在山下的反动军队，给了敌人以严重杀伤。雅加达的反动报纸惊呼：西加里曼丹人民革命武装的“挑战越来越露骨”。这些反动报纸不断叫苦：由于人民革命武装受到人民的支持，又运用着以“毛泽东的学说”为依据的战略战术，反动军队“在技术和装备方面的优势完全失去了意义”，难以对付人民革命武装。
    西加里曼丹人民革命武装在进行紧张战斗的同时，非常重视用毛泽东思想教育当地人民。雅加达反动报纸说，这支人民革命武装在自己的队伍中成立了“毛泽东著作学习组”，并且向当地人民群众“广泛传播毛泽东的共产主义学说”。他们还在乡村中“张贴共产党的标语”对居民进行宣传，并且散发传单，号召人民群众起来反对以美国为首的帝国主义和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权。
    西加里曼丹人民的革命武装斗争，受到了印尼全国人民的欢呼和支持。据安塔拉通讯社透露，最近在中爪哇首府三宝垄，出现了当地革命人民散发的传单。传单热烈欢呼西加里曼丹人民革命武装斗争的胜利发展，并呼吁印尼全国人民起来斗争，推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权对西加里曼丹人民革命武装斗争的发展及其对印尼全国的革命影响，非常恐惧。据美联社报道，这个法西斯政权最近举行一次“内阁”全体会议，讨论了对西加里曼丹人民革命武装进行“围剿”的问题。这次会议“主要关注的”是印尼的“共产主义运动”的发展，并对此“忧心忡忡”。
    西加里曼丹人民革命武装面临的战斗任务，是异常艰巨的。但是，西加里曼丹的人民革命武装，是敢于斗争的英勇战士。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，依靠当地和全国人民的支持，他们在今后漫长的武装革命的征途上，必将一步又一步地粉碎敌人的“围剿”，不断取得新的胜利。
