The theoretical journal *People's Star*, published by the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, recently published an editorial titled "Further Promote the High Tide of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought." The editorial points out that to strengthen the party's political and ideological construction and advance the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, it is necessary to make studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought the central task.

The editorial states: "The 'Three Articles' embody the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, are the soul of the proletarian revolution, the fundamental principle of the communist ideological system, and the sharpest weapon for smashing revisionism. Before the 'Three Articles,' everyone is a student and must use it as a mirror to train oneself into a genuine revolutionary fighter."

The editorial says: Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's "Three Articles" and the brilliant work "Opposing Liberalism" has gradually changed the face of the party organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

The editorial points out that at present, in the revolutionary organizations of Yamaguchi Prefecture, the study of the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* is widespread. Before and after meetings, participants recite quotations relevant to the central issue of the meeting in unison. In more advanced places, this is done daily.

The editorial says: It is a great thing to consider and solve daily problems based on the universal truths and principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and this situation should be further developed in depth and breadth.

The editorial points out that this study movement has already achieved obvious results. Since the beginning of the anti-revisionist struggle, the revolutionary youth organizations in Yamaguchi Prefecture have, in accordance with the "Three Articles," striven to reform themselves, persistently combining this struggle with the masses' struggle, viewing themselves as the driving force of the revolution while also viewing themselves as the object of the revolution, and resolutely fighting against revisionist ideology. This has improved the youth movement at the county level and below.

The editorial says: The Ziruiza Theater has also engaged in a fierce struggle against revisionist ideology, comparing the theater's 15-year-long line with Mao Zedong's literary line, conducting a merciless self-examination, and daring to reform itself in practice. This has laid the foundation for the success of their visit to China for performances.

The editorial concludes: These achievements are all victories of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the initial results of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we should more resolutely, according to the above direction, further promote the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought comprehensively.

A report from the editorial department of the magazine *Study of Mao Zedong Thought*, published by the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Association" of Japan, was published in the January issue under the title "Seriously Study the Works of Comrade Mao Zedong." The report expresses the intention to, in the new year, deeply engage with the masses and the struggle, promote the movement of the Japanese people studying Chairman Mao's works.

The report says that in the past year, Mao Zedong Thought has tempered the broad revolutionary fighters in Japan in their struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Ryoemon revisionist clique, giving the Japanese revolutionary movement a new look and strengthening the ranks of the revolutionary left.

The report says that studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is of decisive significance to us. Without mastering the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to thoroughly and correctly criticize the program, line, and practice of revisionism. It is also impossible to produce new, correct programs, lines, and practices.

The report believes that strengthening the unity of the revolutionary left is an extremely important task. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching of "unity-criticism-unity," different opinions should be overcome through criticism and self-criticism. Only in this way can we achieve a strong unity, which will be more conducive to the struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Ryoemon revisionist clique.

The report says that the important task facing us at present is to go deep into the masses, fighting together with the masses while organizing the masses to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Because without mastering Mao Zedong Thought, we will not achieve victory in modern revolution.

    把活学活用毛泽东思想作为中心任务
    日本山口县等革命派决心全面开展学习毛主席著作运动
    新华社一日讯　东京消息：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）的理论刊物《人民之星》最近发表的一篇题为《进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想运动的高潮》的社论指出：为了加强党的政治、思想建设，推进反帝反修斗争，必须把活学活用毛泽东思想作为中心任务。
    社论指出：“老三篇”体现了毛泽东思想的精华，是无产阶级革命的灵魂，是共产主义思想体系的根本，是粉碎修正主义的最锐利的武器。在“老三篇”面前，任何人都是小学生，都必须把它当成一面镜子，以便把自己锻炼成真正的革命战士。
    社论说：学习毛泽东同志的“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》等光辉著作，已经使山口县的党组织逐步改变了面貌。
    社论指出，目前在山口县的革命组织中，普遍学习《毛主席语录》，在会议的前后，参加会议的人，都齐声朗诵针对会议的中心问题选出的语录，先进的地方每天都齐声朗诵。
    社论说：根据马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理和原则的立场，来考虑和解决日常的问题，这是极大的好事，应使这种情况向深广发展。
    社论指出：这个学习运动已经取得了明显的成果。山口县的革命青年组织从反修斗争开始以来，遵照“老三篇”努力进行自我改造的斗争，坚持使这一斗争同群众斗争相结合，把自己看作是革命动力，同时又把自己看作是革命的对象，坚决同修正主义思想进行了斗争，这就使县以下的青年运动有了改观。
    社论说：齿轮座剧团也进行了激烈的反对修正主义思想的斗争，把长达十五年的剧团的路线，同毛泽东文艺路线相对照，进行了毫不留情的自我检查，结合实践进行了大胆的自我改造，从而建立了访华演出成功的基础。
    社论最后说：这些成就，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是活学活用毛泽东思想所取得的初步成果。因此，我们应该更坚决地根据上述方向把学习毛泽东思想的运动更全面地开展起来。
    新华社东京一日电　由日本“毛泽东思想研究会”出版的杂志《毛泽东思想研究》在一月号发表题为《认真学习毛泽东同志的著作》的编辑部文章，表示要在新的一年中，深入群众、深入斗争，推进日本人民学习毛主席著作的运动。
    文章说，在过去的一年中，毛泽东思想使日本广大革命战士，在同美日反动派及宫本修正主义集团的斗争中，得到了锻炼，日本的革命运动面目一新，革命左派的队伍日益增强。
    文章说，学习毛泽东同志的著作，对于我们是具有决定性意义的大事。如果不掌握毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，就不能彻底地、正确地批判修正主义的纲领、路线和实践。也不可能产生新的、正确的纲领、路线和实践。
    文章认为，加强革命左派之间的团结，是极其重要的任务。根据毛泽东同志的“团结——批评——团结”的教导，不同意见要通过批评与自我批评来克服，只有这样，才能够获得坚强的团结，才能更有利于同美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团的斗争。
    文章说，目前摆在我们面前的重要任务，是深入到群众中去，一面和群众共同战斗，一面组织群众学习毛泽东同志的著作。因为不掌握毛泽东思想就不会取得现代革命的胜利。
