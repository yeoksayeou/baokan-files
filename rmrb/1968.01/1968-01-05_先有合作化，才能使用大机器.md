	Cooperation Must Precede Mechanization

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In agriculture, under the conditions in our country, ... it is necessary to first have cooperation, and then use large machinery." However, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party openly contradicts Chairman Mao. He blathers on about how it is impossible to achieve agricultural collectivization through mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and farm management teams, claiming that it is an unrealistic form of agricultural socialism, that collective farms without machinery cannot be consolidated, and that without industrialization, agriculture cannot possibly be collectivized, and so on. This is purely a line for developing capitalist agriculture.

	After land reform, although we poor and lower-middle peasants each received land, this small-scale peasant economy, where each household is a production unit, quickly led to polarization. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside are developing day by day. New rich peasants have appeared everywhere, and many well-off middle peasants are striving to become rich peasants. Many poor peasants, due to insufficient means of production, remain in poverty, some owe debts, some sell land, or rent out land. If this situation is allowed to continue, the phenomenon of polarization in the countryside will become more and more serious day by day." In our brigade, there are eight households that have become new rich peasants. Four or five households have large rubber-wheeled carts pulled by three or four horses, delivering all the public grain and grain purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives, making money in the process. Two households lend out grain and money, charging "double interest." They lend 100 yuan in the spring and collect 200 in the autumn, lend one picul in the spring and collect two in the autumn. Two households hire permanent workers and seasonal laborers. Due to the ruthless exploitation by the new rich peasants, some poor and lower-middle peasants have fallen back into poverty. Some, unable to repay the debts owed to the new rich peasants, have to sell their seedlings to pay off the debts. Faced with this polarization, how can we follow the socialist path without collectivization? If we follow the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, waiting for industrialization before collectivization, the rich peasant economy in the countryside will develop more and more, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will become more and more destitute, carrying heavy burdens. Isn't this a return to a capitalist society?! We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, follow Chairman Mao's words, actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to "organize," and take the socialist path of collectivization. Through mutual aid teams, elementary agricultural cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives, by 1958 we established people's communes. Grain production increases year by year, income rises year by year, accumulation grows year by year, and commercial grain increases year by year. It is precisely because agriculture has developed along the socialist path that it has fully provided grain, funds, and markets for industry, promoting the realization of industrialization, which in turn has created conditions for the mechanization of agriculture.

	The Chinese Khrushchev advocates mechanization before collectivization, but in reality, this not only fails to achieve agricultural collectivization but also fails to achieve mechanization. Because small-scale peasant economies limit production development, the grain and agricultural by-products provided to the state are minimal, which inevitably affects the realization of socialist industrialization, and the state cannot produce enough agricultural machinery. On the other hand, small-scale peasant economies are weak, with limited funds, and production is scattered among individual households. Even if the state provides agricultural machinery, it cannot be used or operated. Thus, mechanization cannot be achieved. If mechanization cannot be achieved, according to the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, collectivization should not be pursued, and individual farming should continue, allowing polarization in the countryside to continue. The evil intention of the Chinese Khrushchev in advocating "mechanization first, collectivization later" is to develop capitalist agriculture in the countryside.

	We firmly oppose the fallacy of "mechanization first, collectivization later" and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "In agriculture, under the conditions in our country, ... it is necessary to first have cooperation, and then use large machinery." Following this line, our brigade started using tractors in large quantities from 1958. Now, the area under machine cultivation accounts for more than 70% of the cultivated land. To adapt to mechanized development, after discussions among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we merged the original eight production teams into four, and the original 110-plus plots of land, after land consolidation, field leveling, and crop rotation, were combined into 40 large plots. Through these adjustments, it is more suitable for mechanized operations. Spring plowing takes only 13 days, and intertillage is achieved with four tillages and four passes. In addition to tractors, our brigade has nine non-field operation machines, making rice hulling, flour milling, chopping straw, and corn shelling basically mechanized and electrified.

	Under Chairman Mao's leadership, in the struggle between the two lines in the countryside, we have achieved great victories. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao and carry the socialist revolution in the countryside to the end.

### 先有合作化，才能使用大机器

    先有合作化，才能使用大机器
    黑龙江省双城县幸福人民公社庆宁大队　张朋
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在农业方面，在我国的条件下……，则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却公开和毛主席唱反调。他胡说什么：认为农村可以依靠互助组、合作社、代耕队，实行农业集体化是不可能的，是一种空想的农业社会主义，没有机器的集体农庄，是巩固不了的，不实现工业化，农业根本不可能集体化，等等。这纯粹是发展资本主义农业的路线。
    土地改革之后，我们贫下中农虽然家家都分得了土地，但是这种一家一户是一个生产单位的小农经济，很快就出现了两极分化。正如毛主席所指出的：“农村中的资本主义自发势力一天一天地在发展，新富农已经到处出现，许多富裕中农力求把自己变为富农。许多贫农，则因为生产资料不足，仍然处于贫困地位，有些人欠了债，有些人出卖土地，或者出租土地。这种情况如果让它发展下去，农村中向两极分化的现象必然一天一天地严重起来。”在我们大队就有八户成为新富农，有四、五户拴了三、四匹马的大胶轮车，包送全部公粮和供销社的收购粮，从中挣钱发财。有两户放债放粮，“大加一”的利，春贷百元，秋还二百，春贷一石，秋还两石。有两户雇了长工和季节性的短工。由于新富农的残酷剥削，有些贫下中农重新过着贫困生活。有的因借新富农的债没钱还，不得不把青苗卖掉还债。面对这种两极分化情况，不搞合作化怎能走上社会主义道路？如果按中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，等到国家工业化了，再搞集体化，农村的富农经济就会愈来愈发展，我们贫下中农就会愈来愈多的成为一无所有的扛大活的。这不是恢复资本主义社会了吗？！我们广大贫下中农，听毛主席的话，积极响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，走集体化的社会主义大道。经过互助组、初级农业生产合作社发展到高级社，到一九五八年又成立了人民公社。粮食年年增产，收入一年比一年高，积累一年比一年大，商品粮一年比一年多。正由于农业沿着社会主义道路发展，才充分地为工业提供了粮食、资金、市场，促进了工业化的实现，反过来又为实现农业机械化创造了条件。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹先搞机械化，后搞合作化，实际上这样不但实现不了农业集体化，而且也实现不了机械化。因为小农经济限制了生产的发展，向国家提供的粮食和农副产品很少，这就必然影响到社会主义工业化的实现，国家也就不可能生产足够的农业机械。另一方面，小农经济力量单薄，资金很少，又是一家一户地分散生产，即使国家提供了农业机械，也无力使用、无法使用。这样也就不可能实现机械化。机械化实现不了，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，就不应搞集体化，就只有让单干继续下去，让农村的两极分化继续下去。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“先机械化，后合作化”的罪恶目的，就是要发展农村的资本主义。
    我们坚决反对“先机械化，后合作化”的谬论，坚决执行毛主席所指引的“在农业方面，在我国的条件下……，则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”的无产阶级革命路线。按照这条路线，我们大队从一九五八年开始大量使用拖拉机。现在机耕面积占耕地面积百分之七十多。为了适应机械化发展，经过广大贫下中农讨论，把原来八个生产队合并成四个生产队，把原来的一百一十多块土地，经过串地、改垄、调茬，连成四十大块。经过这样调整，更适应机械作业，春耕只要十三天，中耕实现了四铲四趟。除拖拉机外，我们大队还有九台非田间作业机具，使碾米、磨面、铡草、玉米脱粒等基本实现了机械化和电气化。
    在毛主席的领导下，在农村两条道路的斗争中，我们取得了伟大胜利。我们一定紧跟毛主席，把农村社会主义革命进行到底。
