The Vietnamese South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Shanghai this afternoon from Beijing for a visit and performance, and was warmly welcomed by the local People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cultural workers.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, senior officials of the Shanghai-based PLA units, Li Shiyang and Gao Zhirong, as well as representatives from the Shanghai branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Friendship and revolutionary mass organizations in the cultural sector, went to the station to welcome the troupe.

The platform was filled with the warm atmosphere of the fraternal combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The melodies of "The East Is Red" and "Liberate the South" echoed through the air, along with the sound of drums. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, greeting the Vietnamese cultural warriors. As the train pulled into the station, people waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!" "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!" The cultural warriors of both countries shook hands warmly. Chinese comrades pinned shiny Mao badges on their Vietnamese comrades, fully expressing the boundless love of the peoples of China and Vietnam for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Among those welcoming at the station were also representatives of Vietnamese trainees in Shanghai.

In the evening, Shanghai's revolutionary cultural workers held a welcoming performance for the Vietnamese cultural warriors.
