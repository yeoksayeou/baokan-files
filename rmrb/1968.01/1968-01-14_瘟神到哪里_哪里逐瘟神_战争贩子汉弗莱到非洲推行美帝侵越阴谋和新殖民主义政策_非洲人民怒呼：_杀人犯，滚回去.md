	Wherever the Plague God Goes, He Is Driven Away

	The war monger Humphrey to Africa to promote the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and neo-colonialist policies

	African people shout: "Murderer, go back!"

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 12th, the U.S. imperialist war monger, Vice President Humphrey, after engaging in 13 days of conspiratorial activities in several African countries, left Tunisia in disgrace on the 11th amid the protests of the African people and returned to the United States.

	Humphrey led a large "delegation" to Ivory Coast, Liberia, Ghana, Congo (Kinshasa), Kenya, Tunisia, and six other African countries, with the main purpose of peddling the U.S. aggression policy in Vietnam and intensifying its neo-colonialist expansionist conspiracies in Africa.

	During his activities in Africa, Humphrey vigorously promoted the U.S. "war" and "peace" two-pronged counter-revolutionary policy on the Vietnam issue, attempting to seek support.

	At the same time, Humphrey in some places vigorously advocated his "deep interest" in Africa, claiming that the United States continues to "care" about Africa's "peaceful development," attempting to deceive African public opinion and promote U.S. neo-colonialism. Humphrey advocated that in order to adapt to the "world responsibilities" of the United States, U.S. "foreign aid" must be increased. In this activity, Humphrey and the Ivory Coast authorities signed a $36 million loan agreement; he donated $12 million worth of surplus grain to Ghana. According to Western news agencies, he also promised to send a "Peace Corps" to Congo (Kinshasa) and continue to provide "military aid."

	Humphrey's conspiratorial activities in Africa were strongly condemned by the broad masses of the African people, and his plight was even more miserable than that of U.S. Vice President Nixon's activities in Africa ten years ago. According to reports, in Nairobi, demonstrators at the airport "whistled, laughed, and waved anti-American slogans"; in Congo (Kinshasa), angry crowds tore up the American flag and shouted "Murderer, go back!" In Ethiopia, demonstrating students burned an effigy of U.S. President Johnson; in Somalia, hundreds of Somalis held a demonstration, shouting: "Humphrey, go back!" Before Humphrey even arrived in Tunisia, anti-American leaflets appeared on the streets of Tunisia.

	In the face of the increasingly awakened African people, the U.S. imperialist attempt to intensify its neo-colonialist conspiracies is doomed to failure. U.S. officials had to admit that Humphrey found that there was "a lot of pressure" in Africa, including the "turmoil" caused by the national independence movement in Africa.

    瘟神到哪里　哪里逐瘟神
    战争贩子汉弗莱到非洲推行美帝侵越阴谋和新殖民主义政策
    非洲人民怒呼：“杀人犯，滚回去”
    据新华社十二日讯 美帝国主义战争贩子、副总统汉弗莱在非洲一些国家进行了十三天的阴谋活动后，在非洲人民的抗议声中于十一日灰溜溜地离开突尼斯返回美国。
    汉弗莱率领了一个庞大的“代表团”到象牙海岸、利比里亚、加纳、刚果（金）、肯尼亚、突尼斯等九个非洲国家进行活动，其主要目的是贩卖美国在越南的侵略政策，加紧推行它在非洲的新殖民主义扩张阴谋。
    汉弗莱在非洲活动的过程中竭力推销美国在越南问题上的战、“和”两手反革命政策，妄图寻取支持。
    与此同时，汉弗莱在一些地方大肆宣扬他对非洲有“深切的兴趣”，美国继续“关心”非洲的“和平发展”，妄图以此来欺骗非洲舆论，推行美国的新殖民主义。汉弗莱鼓吹说，为了适应美国的“世界责任”，美国的“外援”必须增加。在这次活动中，汉弗莱和象牙海岸当局签订了三千六百万美元的贷款协定；向加纳施舍了价值一千二百万美元的剩余粮食。据西方通讯社报道，他还答应向刚果（金）派出“和平队”和继续提供“军援”。
    汉弗莱在非洲的阴谋活动遭到了非洲广大人民的强烈谴责，他的遭遇比十年前的美国副总统尼克松到非洲活动时更为狼狈。据报道，在内罗毕，机场的示威群众“吹口哨，发出叽笑声，并且挥动反美标语牌”；在刚果（金），愤怒的群众撕毁了美国国旗，高呼“杀人犯，滚回去！”在埃塞俄比亚，示威学生烧毁了美国总统约翰逊的模拟人像；在索马里，几百名索马里人民举行了示威，高呼：“汉弗莱滚回去！”汉弗莱还没有到达突尼斯，突尼斯街头就出现了反美传单。
    在日益觉醒的非洲人民面前，美帝国主义企图加紧推行新殖民主义的阴谋是绝对不会得逞的。美国官员不得不承认，汉弗莱发现在非洲“有许多压力”，其中包括由于民族独立运动而在非洲引起的“动荡不安”。
