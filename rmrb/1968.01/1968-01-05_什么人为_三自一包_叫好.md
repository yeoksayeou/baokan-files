During the three years of natural disasters in China, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the number one schemer who dreams of restoring capitalism in China, thought that the "great opportunity" had arrived. He collaborated with the reactionary elements in society to push the "Three Selfs and One Contract" black goods, attempting to drag socialist New China back to the capitalist road he dreams of.

After the "Three Selfs and One Contract" policy reached the countryside, it immediately received enthusiastic support from a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. In the place where I was working on the Four Clean-ups, these reactionaries became very arrogant. They loudly proclaimed that "the day of our comeback has arrived" and "the land will return to its original owners." When a poor peasant's house was damaged, and the production team allocated him a plot of land to rebuild, a landlord actually rushed over and shouted, "This land belongs to my family. We will also build a house here." The landlords and rich peasants openly counterattacked the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In one production team, the only sideline was selling firewood. They implemented the "self-responsibility for profits and losses" and "contracting for cash" methods. A rich peasant from the team went to sell firewood and actually worked the team's horse to death.

The result of the "Three Selfs and One Contract" was that capitalist forces in the countryside quickly developed, and the phenomenon of polarization became very serious. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "The 'Three Selfs and One Contract' enriched the landlords and rich peasants, impoverished the poor and lower-middle peasants, and wanted us to return to the old road before liberation, to suffer twice!" Who benefits from the "Three Selfs and One Contract"? This is clear. Linking it to the initial period after liberation, when the Chinese Khrushchev advocated for the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" households, and the entire set of bourgeois reactionary lines implemented in various historical periods, it is even clearer that he is a faithful agent of the bourgeoisie, landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. He thinks of capitalism, speaks of capitalism, loves capitalism, praises capitalism, and schemes in every way to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, the revolution will eventually occur and will certainly be victorious, whether it is sooner or later." Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have smashed the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism. We must take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, carry the class struggle in the countryside to the end, and turn the countryside into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    什么人为“三自一包”叫好
    铁道兵某部　程清顺
    在我国遭受三年自然灾害的时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，这个日夜想着在中国复辟资本主义的头号野心家，自以为“大好时机”已经到来，和社会上的牛鬼蛇神相呼应，抛出了“三自一包”黑货，妄图把社会主义的新中国拉到他所梦想的资本主义道路上去。
    “三自一包”传到农村后，立即得到了农村一小撮地富反坏分子的拍手欢迎。就在我搞四清工作的那个地方，这些反动家伙的气焰可嚣张了。他们大肆叫嚷什么“出头的日子到了”，“土地要回老家了”。有个贫农的住房坏了，生产队给他分配了地基，正要动工兴建的时候，一个地主分子竟然跑去大吵大嚷说：“这块地是我家的，我们也要在这里盖房子。”地富分子公然向贫下中农反攻倒算了。
    有一个生产队，唯一的副业是砍柴卖，也实行了“自负盈亏”、“包交现金”的办法。队里的一个富农去驮柴卖，竟把生产队拉大车的马活活累死。
    “三自一包”的结果，农村中的资本主义势力迅速发展，两极分化的现象十分严重。广大贫下中农愤恨地说：“三自一包”富了地主富农，穷了贫下中农，这是要我们再回到解放前的老路上去，吃二遍苦啊！“三自一包”对谁有利，这还不清楚吗？联系解放初期中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹要发展“三马一犁一车的农户”，以及各个历史时期所推行的一整套资产阶级反动路线，更清楚地看到他是资产阶级、地富反坏分子的忠实的代理人。他想的是资本主义，说的是资本主义，爱的是资本主义，歌颂的还是资本主义，千方百计搞的是资本主义复辟。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，把农村两条道路斗争进行到底，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
