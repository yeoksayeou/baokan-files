In the midst of the nationwide celebration of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our heroic air force has reported a triumph. On January 20, they shot down an American unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that had intruded into our airspace over Yunnan, delivering a heavy blow to the war provocations of American imperialism.

The air force's first victory of the new year once again proves a timeless truth: unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao brings unlimited combat power.

The phrase "Loyalty to Chairman Mao" shines brightly in the air force, serving as the most prominent and vivid red line that permeates all aspects of the unit. It is the greatest motivation for all officers and soldiers in their battles, work, and studies.

The air force unit that achieved this victory is one that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They follow Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," stand guard at their posts, and remain ever-ready. As soon as the enemy's claws reached into our airspace, they were immediately cut off. They directed the battle with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the greatest courage and wisdom, achieving brilliant results, and making new contributions to the people.

Chairman Mao said, "Any imperialist aggression will be crushed by us."

The victory of the air force is also a serious warning to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. Any plot to sabotage our socialist construction, disrupt our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, or undermine our great cause of aiding Vietnam and resisting America will meet with disgraceful failure in the face of the People's Liberation Army of China, which is loyal to Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The People's Liberation Army of China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is invincible in the world!

    无限忠于毛主席就有无限的战斗力
    本报评论员
    在全国军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我英雄的空军部队传来捷报，一月二十日，一举击落了侵入我云南地区上空的美国军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架，给了美帝国主义的战争挑衅当头一棒。
    空军部队新年以来的首战胜利，又一次证明了这样一个颠扑不破的真理：无限忠于毛主席，就有无限的战斗力。
    “忠于毛主席”五个金光闪闪的大字，在空军部队里，成为贯穿一切方面的一条最鲜明、最突出的红线，成为广大指战员进行战斗、工作和学习的最大动力。
    取得这次战斗胜利的空军部队，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的部队。他们遵循毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，严守岗位，常备不懈，当敌人的魔爪一伸入我国领空，就立即被他们斩断。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指挥战斗，表现了最大的勇敢和智慧，创造了辉煌的战果，为人民立下了新功。
    毛主席说：“任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎”。
    空军部队的胜利，同时也是给美帝、苏修和各国反动派的严重警告。任何妄图破坏我国社会主义建设，破坏我国无产阶级文化大革命，破坏我国人民援越抗美伟大事业的阴谋，在无限忠于毛主席、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军面前，一定遭到可耻的失败。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民解放军，无敌于天下！
