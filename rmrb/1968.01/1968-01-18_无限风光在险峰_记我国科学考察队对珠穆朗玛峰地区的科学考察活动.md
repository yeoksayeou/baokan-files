In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, a comprehensive scientific expedition team organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, comprising 23 units nationwide, nearly 30 disciplines, and over 100 revolutionary scientific workers, hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, and Tibetan laborers, they conducted an unprecedented large-scale comprehensive scientific expedition in the Mount Everest region, the world's highest peak, achieving brilliant results. This is another stirring victory song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of victory and the source of strength. All the achievements in the expedition to the "roof of the roof of the world"—the Mount Everest region—are the result of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is the brilliant thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao that guided the young expedition members to successfully complete the large-scale scientific expedition to the world's highest peak, establishing new merits for the motherland.

	We Have a Red Sun in Our Hearts
	“We must definitely plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the Mount Everest solar radiation research front.” This is the bold declaration of the solar radiation observation team members.

Solar radiation is an important energy source on Earth. Mount Everest is high in altitude with great atmospheric transparency, making it an ideal place to study solar radiation patterns. In 1963, an American mountaineering team secretly climbed to just below 6,000 meters on the southern slope of Everest and conducted solar radiation observations. They obtained some so-called data and published numerous articles, boasting and showing off.

The revolutionary scientific workers of China were extremely indignant at the provocation by American imperialism. They knew that their expedition was not just a struggle against nature and the Earth, but more importantly, a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Therefore, they were determined to create outstanding achievements no matter how great the difficulties. Together with meteorological workers, they conducted solar radiation and high-altitude meteorological observations at altitudes of 5,900 meters, 6,500 meters, and above 7,000 meters on Mount Everest, finally obtaining solar radiation observation data from the highest point on Earth's surface, far surpassing the solar radiation data stolen by American imperialism in 1963 on the southern slope of Everest.

On the northern slope of Mount Everest, to climb above 7,000 meters, one must pass through the treacherous North Col, which is the "gate" to the summit of Everest, with an average slope of 55 degrees. The ice slope at the top of the North Col is even steeper, almost vertical. The British called this the "death zone" because their "explorers" had lost their lives here, deeming it "impassable." However, in the face of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the treacherous North Col was seen as an easy path. In 1960, young Chinese mountaineers first passed through here and reached the summit of Mount Everest. Now, the Chinese scientific expedition team was about to create new miracles here.

One step at a time, the expedition members, each carrying equipment weighing 20 kilograms, climbed the icy and snowy Mount Everest above 6,000 meters, especially crossing the treacherous North Col. Twenty kilograms on flat ground is nothing, but on the icy and snowy Mount Everest above 6,000 meters, especially when crossing the treacherous North Col, it felt like a thousand-pound burden on each person, and every step forward required a great deal of effort.

	“Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.” As they crossed the treacherous North Col, the team members repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao's words helped them overcome one difficulty after another and conquer one danger after another. They said, "Chairman Mao is commanding our battle, and no force can stop us from advancing!" Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they trampled the snow and ice, overcoming the ever-changing weather, and finally reached their respective observation points.

	Even Greater Challenges Ahead
To obtain solar radiation data, one must persist in working for a relatively long time. In the past, imperialists and some reactionary "authorities" believed that it was impossible to work for a long time at altitudes above 6,000 meters. However, the revolutionary scientific workers of China broke superstitions and liberated their minds. They broke free from foreign frameworks and kicked away the crawling mentality, eating and sleeping on the ice mountains, working tirelessly from dawn to dusk. At night, winds of 8 to 9 levels often blew, howling with snow particles. The cold wind pierced their bones, but it did not shake the will of the revolutionary scientific workers. They said, "We have a red sun in our hearts, which is the source of heat and the driving force for our work." They persisted in this battle day and night!

When they had been fighting for six days and nights in a row, their food was gone, and their fuel was used up! Facing this seemingly insurmountable difficulty, what should they do? The radiance of Beijing shone in the hearts of every expedition member. At this moment, they seemed to see Chairman Mao standing on Tiananmen, waving to them, and heard Chairman Mao's teachings: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength to fight against the wind and snow and endure the cold. They persisted in the last day of observation until they successfully completed their mission.

	The More Difficult the Place, the More We Must Go
The revolutionary surveyors of the scientific expedition team also experienced a fierce battle. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army and local Tibetan people, they had climbed 20 peaks above 6,000 to 7,000 meters in the Mount Everest region, passing through 61 observation points, and conducted astronomical, triangulation, leveling, and ground stereophotogrammetry measurements of Mount Everest from different angles, creating an unprecedented miracle in the history of surveying and mapping.

The Zhong Rongbu Glacier cascades down from the mid-slope of Mount Everest like a waterfall. Here, ice towers stand tall, the ice is hard, and the slopes are steep, with crevasses everywhere, and no one had ever set foot here. However, the revolutionary surveyors armed with Mao Zedong Thought were fearless. One day in May, they finally opened its door and stepped into this seemingly impassable area.

	“The more difficult the place, the more we must go.” This was the common oath of the scientific expedition team in their expedition to the Mount Everest region.

To select observation points on Mount Everest, the surveyors crossed crevasses fearlessly, appearing and disappearing among the ice towers. Suddenly, a tall ice wall blocked their way. What should they do? “What is work? Work is struggle. Those places with difficulties and problems need us to solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is what a good comrade should do.” Chairman Mao's great teachings gave them boundless strength and courage. The expedition members used ice axes to dig steps and climb up, taking 40 minutes to climb a 40-50 meter path to the top.

They stood on the top of this ice wall and looked forward, only to see another vertical ice cliff. How could they get down? Everyone was at a loss. At this moment, a Tibetan team member slid down along the rope he had tied. Seeing this, everyone smiled with victory. One by one, they followed his method and successfully crossed this obstacle.

One wide crevasse after another, one tall ice wall after another still lay before them, and more difficulties and greater challenges awaited them. In the evening, they camped on the glacier, sitting in the tent and opening the red revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reading aloud under the candlelight: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in difficult times, and raise our courage."... This voice awakened the ice and snow valleys that had slept for millions of years.

The next day, they crossed the Zhong Rongbu Glacier, selected the first observation point, and began the intense observation work with the spirit of "seizing the day." The second point, the third point... the observation work was also successfully completed. By the seventh point, which was the last one, everyone had prepared everything, and they set out at 3 AM in the dark, crossing one crevasse after another under the moonlight, sometimes having to stop temporarily to avoid falling rocks, and only reaching this observation point around noon. To avoid missing the opportunity, everyone started working without even eating.

A blizzard came, with winds of 7 to 8 levels blowing in large snowflakes, making the work extremely difficult. However, everyone had a common belief: perseverance is victory! They used canvas and their own bodies to protect the observation instruments from being blown over by the wind. The comrades responsible for observation spread their legs to stand firmly. They withstood the howling wind and finally conquered the blizzard, successfully capturing the last observation point and obtaining the survey data for the seventh point.

At this time, they had been fighting on the Zhong Rongbu Glacier for 15 days and nights. Due to the strong ultraviolet radiation, high-altitude hypoxia, and the blowing wind, the expedition members' faces were swollen, and some had swollen lips so thick that they found it difficult to eat. But no one complained, and for the final victory, they endured the pain in their bodies and the sweetness in their hearts.

Astronomical point observation is a task carried out at night. On the glacier of Mount Everest, at an altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 meters, it is not only cold at night but also in the daytime. However, the comrades responsible for this task fearlessly faced the cold, climbing to a mountain top over 6,000 meters high, facing the sand and stones blown by the wind.

On the first night they climbed this mountain top, they encountered bad weather, and the wind almost blew away their tent, making it impossible for them to work. At this difficult time, the young expedition members used their bodies to press down the tent, and some tightly hugged the boxes containing the instruments to prevent them from being destroyed by the wind. They fought against the bad weather of Mount Everest for two days. On the third day, the weather cleared. They immediately seized the opportunity to conduct observations. The wind was strong, so they covered the observation instruments with cloth; their hands were frozen, so they warmed them with their breath; the wind blew off the reflective mirrors on the instruments, so they shone their flashlights and moved one stone after another to find the reflective mirrors and reinstall them, continuing their work.

The revolutionary surveyors of China, in the days and nights of surveying the world's highest peak, fought against the wind, snow, and cold, high-altitude hypoxia, and complex terrain, finally capturing this position and writing a new victory song in the history of human science.

	With the Spirit of the Mythical Qu Yuan, We Will Make Everest Bow Its Head
After three days of arduous marching and work, the members of the geophysical group climbed to an altitude of 6,400 meters on Mount Everest. They wanted to obtain new geomagnetic data at an altitude of 6,500 meters.

	“With the spirit of the mythical Qu Yuan, we will make Everest bow its head,” the three members of this group had such a great ambition. After climbing to an altitude of 6,400 meters on Everest, they were only 100 meters away from their goal, and victory was in sight.

However, at this moment, an unexpected thing happened. One comrade, due to severe high-altitude reaction, could not move forward. On this icy and snowy mountain with harsh weather, the task of three people had to be completed by two. This was so difficult! But when they thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "No matter how difficult and painful the situation is, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight," they solemnly swore: "Even if there is only one person left, we will continue to fight until we achieve the final victory."

One hundred meters, only one hundred meters, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes passed, half an hour, forty minutes passed, and they still had not climbed up. What should they do? So they opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, it will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy." Chairman Mao's teachings filled them with boundless strength. They said, "We will definitely conquer this enemy of nature, and Everest will not bow its head until we are satisfied." After a fierce battle, they reached their destination.

The wind and snow were thick, and it gradually grew dark. They spent a sleepless night in the high mountains, and after a day of hard work the next day, they finally obtained the highest-altitude geomagnetic data in the history of geomagnetic measurements.

The discovery of the early Paleozoic stratum is another example of the scientific expedition team's great ambition, breaking superstitions, and liberating their minds.

The history of geological development is like the history of human development, and the lack of one era makes it impossible to understand the whole picture. For more than a hundred years, the geological history of the Mount Everest region has been distorted by the so-called "explorers" of various imperialist countries, who wrongly concluded that this region might not have early Paleozoic strata.

The scientific expedition team of China, while conducting an expedition in the Mount Everest region, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the fields of production struggle and scientific experiment, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is also constantly developing and will never stop at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. The theory of stagnation, the theory of pessimism, the theory of doing nothing and being complacent, are all wrong. They are wrong because these theories do not conform to the historical facts of the development of human society for approximately one hundred thousand years, nor do they conform to the historical facts of nature (for example, the history of celestial bodies, the history of the Earth, the history of life, and the history of other natural sciences reflected in nature) that we know so far." Chairman Mao's teachings helped them break superstitions and liberate their minds. With fiery class feelings for Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland, they moved mountains with the spirit of Yu Gong, climbed snow-capped mountains, and waded through icy waters, finally finding the early Paleozoic strata that had slept for four to five billion years on the paths where foreign "explorers" had walked many times, completing the geological history of the Mount Everest region.

	Let the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
	Forever Fly on the World's Highest Peak
Great Mao Zedong Thought guided the expedition members to climb the peak of science and technology, and great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee of all our victories. Whether driving on the vast Tibetan Plateau or conducting expeditions on the icy slopes of Everest shrouded in wind and snow; whether before setting out in the morning or after successfully completing a day's work, the expedition members always studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in everything they did. They stepped on difficulties and faced obstacles head-on, and it was Mao Zedong Thought that kept them on the right path. They were all spirited and full of fighting spirit, and it was Mao Zedong Thought that gave them boundless strength. "Sandstorms cover the caravan on the plateau, hypoxia is not difficult, laughing at the dangers of Tanggula. The Himalayas tower high, revolutionary enthusiasm is boundless, four volumes of heroic texts in hand, what fear is there in climbing Everest?" These lines full of fighting spirit express the great aspirations of every expedition member!

From Shigatse to the Yarlung Zangbo River, the round trip required crossing five mountains over 5,000 meters high. The road was treacherous, and the wind and snow were strong, sometimes forcing people to move sideways. The heroic People's Liberation Army, who assisted the scientific expedition, carried forward the spirit of fearlessness, selflessly helping others, paving the way for the expedition members. Wherever it was most dangerous, there they were. They took off their own padded coats and let the expedition members wear them, and in times of extreme water shortage, they gave their saved water to the expedition members. When some members fell due to high-altitude reactions, the soldiers helped them up and supported them as they walked. In the most difficult times, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army always loudly recited the great teachings of Chairman Mao, encouraging the expedition members to climb snow-capped mountains, wade through icy waters, and overcome countless difficulties, successfully completing the expedition mission.

Every day after work, no matter how tired they were or how late they returned, the expedition members always gathered together to listen to the radio, listening to the voice from Beijing. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," they immediately responded and held a self-criticism meeting on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," breaking down the "self," and fiercely criticizing the revisionist line of scientific research.

Throughout the scientific expedition, the expedition members and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army not only armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought but also actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the local people. They were not only a scientific expedition team but also a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought.

Every time they arrived at a residential area, they enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought in various forms. When they arrived at the Nadang Village Production Team in Dayu County, they first held an exhibition of "Chairman Mao is the Reddest Red Sun in Our Hearts" for the farmers and herdsmen. The good news spread throughout the entire village, and the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen who deeply loved Chairman Mao enthusiastically came to visit, beating drums and gongs. The expedition members and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically propagated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to them.

The expedition members and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, during the scientific expedition, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the masses, visited poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen, learned from them, labored with them, cultivated feelings for the workers and peasants, and transformed their worldview. The Tibetan laborers expressed to the expedition members and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army their determination to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the world's highest peak!

    无限风光在险峰
    记我国科学考察队对珠穆朗玛峰地区的科学考察活动
    在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，由中国科学院组织的全国二十三个单位、近三十个学科、一百多名革命科学工作者参加的综合科学考察队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在中国人民解放军、革命工人、藏族劳动人民的大力支持和协助下，对世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰地区，进行了人类科学史上空前规模的综合科学考察，取得了辉煌成果。这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一曲动人心魄的凯歌。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是胜利的保证，力量的源泉。对世界“屋脊的屋脊”——珠穆朗玛峰地区考察取得的一切成果，都是来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想。是伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想指引着年青的科学考察队员，胜利完成了世界第一高峰的大规模科学考察工作，为祖国建立了新的功勋。
        我们心中有个红太阳
      “一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插上珠穆朗玛峰太阳辐射研究这个阵地。”这是太阳辐射观测小组的科考队员的豪言壮语。
    太阳辐射是地球上重要的能量源泉。珠穆朗玛峰海拔高，大气透明度大，是探讨太阳辐射规律的一个理想的场所。一九六三年美国登山队曾从珠峰南坡偷爬到不到六千米的高度，进行过太阳辐射观测。他们弄了一点所谓资料，竟然连篇累牍地发表文章，大肆吹嘘，招摇过市。
    我国革命的科学工作者，对于美帝国主义的挑衅，万分愤慨。他们深深知道，他们这次的考察是在与天斗，与地斗，更重要的是与帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派斗。因此，他们下定决心，不论遇到多大困难，也要创造出出色的成就。他们和气象工作者一起，先后在珠穆朗玛峰海拔五千九百米、六千五百米和七千米以上的地方，作了太阳辐射和高山气象考察，终于取得了世界上地表面最高点的太阳辐射观测数据，把美帝国主义一九六三年在珠穆朗玛峰南坡偷窃的太阳辐射资料，远远地抛在后面。
    在珠穆朗玛峰北坡，要攀登到七千米以上，必须经过六千六百米到七千零七米的天险北坳。它是通往珠峰顶峰的“大门”，平均坡度五十五度。北坳顶部的冰坡坡度更大，几乎与地面垂直。英国人就是因为他们的“探险家”在这里葬送过生命，所以一直把北坳称为“不可攀援”的“死亡路线”。然而，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民面前，天险北坳早就视为坦途。一九六○年，我国年青的登山队员，第一次通过这里登上了珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。现在，我国科学考察队又要在这里创造出新的人间奇迹。
    一步一个脚印，科学考察队员们，全部行装加上仪器，每人都要负重二十公斤。二十公斤，在平地上算得了什么？可是在冰天雪地的珠穆朗玛峰六千米以上，尤其要攀越天险北坳，它象千斤重担压在每个人身上，每前进一步都要付出巨大的代价。
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在通过天险北坳的时候，队员们不断地朗诵着毛主席语录。毛主席的话，使他们克服了一个又一个困难，战胜了一个又一个险阻。他们说：“毛主席在指挥着我们战斗，没有任何力量能够阻止我们前进！”他们在毛泽东思想指引下，踏雪踩冰，战胜了变幻莫测的天气，终于分别到达了各个观测点。
      更严峻的考验还在后面
    要取得太阳辐射的数据，就必须坚持较长时间的工作。过去，帝国主义者和一些反动“权威”认为，在海拔六千米以上坚持较长时间的工作是不可能的。但是，我国革命的科学工作者，破除迷信，解放思想，他们打破洋框框，踢开爬行主义，吃在冰山上，睡在冰山上，从早到晚进行紧张的观测。夜间，常常刮起八、九级大风，狂风夹着雪粒呼啸着。寒风刺痛了人们的筋骨，但是丝毫没有动摇革命的科学工作者的意志。他们说：“我们心中有个红太阳，这是热能的源泉，工作的动力。”他们就是这样日日夜夜地坚持战斗！
    当他们连续奋战了六个日日夜夜的时候，粮食吃光了，汽油用完了！面对着这难以克服的困难，怎么办？北京的光辉照耀着每个科考队员的心，这时他们好象看见毛主席站在天安门上，向他们频频招手，耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”毛主席的教导，给了他们战风雪、抗严寒的无穷的力量。他们又坚持了最后一天观测，直到胜利地完成任务。
      越是困难的地方越是要去
    科学考察队的革命的测绘工作者，经历的又是一番战斗情景。他们在人民解放军和当地藏族人民的大力协助下，曾经登上珠穆朗玛峰地区二十座海拔六千到七千米以上的高峰，通过六十一个观测点，从不同的角度对珠穆朗玛峰进行了天文、三角、水准、地面立体摄影等测量工作，创造了世界测绘史上空前未有的奇迹。
    中绒布冰川象瀑布一样，由珠穆朗玛峰的半山腰飞泻而下。这里冰塔林立，冰坚坡陡，裂缝密布，从无人迹。然而，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命的测绘工作者是无所畏惧的。五月的一天，他们终于敲开了它的大门，踏上了这不可逾越的地区。
    “越是困难的地方越是要去”。这是科学考察队在考察珠穆朗玛峰地区的共同誓言。
    为了选择珠穆朗玛峰的观测点，测绘工作者横跨裂缝，不畏艰险，出没在冰塔林中。突然，前面一堵高大的冰墙挡住了去路，怎么办？“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的伟大教导给了他们无限力量和勇气。科考队员们用冰镐边刨台阶边向上攀登，四五十米的路用了四十分钟才爬到顶端。
    他们踏上这堵冰墙的顶端，朝前一看，那边又是一道笔直的冰崖。怎么下去呢？大家拿不定主意。这时候一位藏族队员却顺着他拴好的绳索滑了下去。同志们看到这种情景，都露出了胜利的微笑。一个个照他的办法，胜利地闯过了这道难关。
    一条条宽大的裂缝、一堵堵高矗的冰墙依然横在眼前，更多的困难，更严峻的考验，还在等待着他们。傍晚宿营在冰川上，大家坐在帐篷里打开红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，借着烛光齐声朗读：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”……这声音叩醒了沉睡万年的冰雪山峪。
    第二天，他们横穿过中绒布冰川，选好了第一个观测点，用“只争朝夕”的精神开始了紧张的观测工作。第二个点、第三个点……的观测工作也都已经胜利完成。到了第七个点，也是最后一个点，大家作好了各项准备工作，深夜三时就出发了，借着月光越过一条条冰裂缝，有时还要暂时停下来躲避滚石，接近中午时才到达这个观测点。为了不错过时机，大家饭都没有来得及吃就开始了工作。
    一场暴风雪来到了，七、八级大风卷着大雪扑来，工作遇到了空前困难。但是，大家都有一个共同信念：坚持下去就是胜利！他们用帆布和自己的身体挡住观测仪器，以防被风吹倒。担任观测的同志，叉开两腿尽量使自己站稳。他们顶住咆哮的狂风，终于战胜了暴风雪，胜利地攻下了最后一个观测点，取得了第七个点的测绘资料。
    这时他们战斗在中绒布冰川上已是第十五个日日夜夜了，由于紫外线的强烈照射、高山缺氧和寒风的吹打，科考队员们的脸都浮肿了，有的人嘴唇也肿得老厚，吃东西都感到困难。但没有任何人叫过苦，为了坚持到最后胜利，他们痛在身上，甜在心上。
    天文点观测，是在夜间进行的一项工作。在珠穆朗玛峰的冰川上，在海拔六、七千米的高山上，不要说夜晚，就是在白天也寒气逼人。可是担任这项工作的同志们不畏严寒，迎着狂风吹来的沙石登上了海拔六千多米的一个山头。
    他们登上这座山头的第一个夜晚，就遇上坏天气，狂风几乎卷走帐篷，使他们无法进行工作。在这困难的时候，年青的科考队员们有的用身体压住帐篷，有的牢牢抱住装着仪器的箱子以免遭受狂风的破坏。他们就这样与珠穆朗玛峰的恶劣气候进行了两天搏斗。第三天，天晴了。他们马上抓紧时机进行观测。风大，他们用布遮住观测仪器；手冻僵了，他们用呼出的热气暖一暖；狂风吹落了仪器上的反光镜，他们就打亮手电搬开一块又一块的石头，把反光镜找回来装好，依然继续工作。
    我国革命的测绘工作者们，在这次测绘世界最高峰的日日夜夜里，就是这样与风雪严寒搏斗，与高山缺氧的痛苦搏斗，与复杂的地形搏斗，终于攻下了这一阵地，在人类科学史上写下了新的胜利凯歌。
      立下愚公志定叫珠峰把头低
    经过三天的艰苦行军和工作，地球物理小组的同志攀登了珠穆朗玛峰六千四百米的高度。他们要在六千五百米处取得新的地磁资料。
      “立下愚公志，定叫珠峰把头低”，这个小组的三个同志胸怀这样的壮志，登上珠峰六千四百米的高度以后，离目的地只有一百米了，胜利就在眼前。
    然而，就在这时候意外的事情发生了。一位同志因为高山反应剧烈，不能再前进了。在这冰天雪地，气候恶劣的雪山上，三个人的任务要由两个人去完成，这是多么难啊！但当他们想起毛主席“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的教导时，他们毅然宣誓：就是剩下一个人，也要继续战斗下去，直到取得最后胜利。
    一百米，只有一百米，可是，十分钟过去了，二十分钟过去了，半个钟头、四十分钟过去了，他们还没有登上去。怎么办？于是他们打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗读：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的教导，使他们浑身充满了无穷的力量。他们说：“大自然这个敌人，我们一定要征服，珠峰不低头，我们誓不罢休。”经过一场艰苦奋战，到达了目的地。
    风雪弥漫，天渐渐地黑了，他们在高山中，度过了一个不眠之夜，经过第二天的辛勤劳动，终于取得了世界地磁测量史上最高点的地磁资料。
    早古生代地层的发现，是科学考察队员大学愚公志，破除迷信，解放思想的又一范例。
    地质发展历史同人类的发展历史一样，缺一个时代都是无法了解全貌的。一百多年来，珠穆朗玛峰地区的地质历史一直被各帝国主义国家的所谓“探险家”所歪曲，他们错误地断定这个地区可能没有早古生代地层。
    我国科学考察队员在珠穆朗玛峰地区进行考察时，反复学习了毛主席的教导：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。其所以是错误，因为这些论点，不符合大约一百万年以来人类社会发展的历史事实，也不符合迄今为止我们所知道的自然界
  （例如天体史，地球史，生物史，其他各种自然科学史所反映的自然界）的历史事实。”毛主席的教导使他们破除了迷信，解放了思想。他们满怀着为毛主席和祖国人民争光的火热阶级感情，以愚公移山的精神，爬雪山，涉冰水，终于在外国“探险家”们多次走过的路上，找到了沉睡四、五亿年的早古生代地层，补全了珠穆朗玛峰地区的地质历史。
    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗
        永远飘扬在世界最高峰
    伟大的毛泽东思想指引着科学考察队员们攀登科学技术的高峰，伟大的毛泽东思想是我们取得一切胜利的根本保证。不论是驱车奔驰在茫茫的西藏高原，还是在那风雪弥漫的珠峰冰坡考察；不论是清晨整装待发前，还是胜利地完成了一天的工作任务后，科学考察队员时时、事事、处处活学活用毛泽东思想。他们踩着困难走，迎着阻力上，是毛泽东思想使他们心明眼亮不迷途。他们人人精神振奋，个个斗志昂扬，是毛泽东思想给了他们无穷的力量。“风沙弥漫，车队驰高原，缺氧反应不算难，笑看唐古峻险。喜马拉雅高耸，革命干劲无穷，四卷雄文在手，何愁难攀珠峰。”这充满战斗豪情的诗句，表达了每个科学考察队员的壮志雄心！
    从日喀则到雅鲁藏布江，往返要翻五座五千米以上的高山。山路险，风雪大，有时强迫人们侧着身子前进。协助科学考察的英雄的人民解放军，发扬大无畏的革命精神，毫不利己，专门利人，为科考队员们探路，哪里最危险哪里就有他们。他们脱下了自己的棉大衣让科考队员们穿，在极度缺水的时候，他们把自己节省下的水让科考队员们喝。有的队员因为高山反应跌倒时，解放军扶起他们，搀着走。在最困难的时候，解放军同志总是高声朗诵伟大领袖毛主席的教导，鼓舞着科考队员们爬雪山，涉冰水，闯过了千难万险，胜利完成考察任务。
    每天工作回来，不管有多累，回来得有多晚，科学考察队员们总是聚精会神地在一起听广播，听来自北京的声音。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，他们闻风而动，在雅鲁藏布江畔举行了斗私批修会，讲用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，狠批修正主义科研路线。
    在整个科学考察中，科考队员和解放军指战员，不但用毛泽东思想武装自己，而且积极向当地群众宣传毛泽东思想，他们既是科学考察队，又是毛泽东思想宣传队。
    每到一个居民点，他们就用各种形式热情地宣传毛泽东思想。当他们来到日喀则那当乡那当生产队时，首先就给农牧民举办了“毛主席是我们心中最红的红太阳”图片展览。喜讯传遍整个山村，无限热爱毛主席的广大农牧民，敲锣打鼓，成群结队前来参观。考察队员和解放军指战员，热情地向他们宣传无产阶级文化大革命，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    考察队员和人民解放军指战员，在科学考察过程中，遵照毛主席的教导，深入群众，访问贫下中农和牧民，向他们学习，同他们一起劳动，培养工农感情，改造世界观。藏族劳动人民向科考队员和人民解放军表示，决心让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远高高地飘扬在世界最高峰上！　新华社记者
