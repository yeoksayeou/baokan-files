The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held an expanded meeting to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The committee firmly follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Attendees of this meeting included all members of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, as well as responsible comrades from the Guizhou Provincial Military Region. Key leaders from the revolutionary committees of various prefectures (districts), counties, military sub-districts, and people's armed departments, as well as representatives from factories, mines, schools, government agencies, and the People's Liberation Army tasked with "three-in-one" and "two-support" missions, totaling more than a thousand people.

The attendees repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the New Year's editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They summarized the work of the past year, adhering to the spirit of "promoting achievements, correcting errors, and preparing for future battles." They connected the instructions to their actual situations, thoroughly understanding Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They formulated the "Plan by the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guizhou Provincial Military Region for Further Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions and Achieving Comprehensive Victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." All attendees expressed their confidence, stating that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and strive to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

All attendees unanimously agreed that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province is as good as in other parts of the country. The revolutionary masses across the province have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale. The movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has entered a new stage, and Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated deeper into people's hearts. Especially since the provincial conference of active learners and practitioners of Chairman Mao's works in December, there has been a surge of enthusiasm for studying and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. More than 30,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established across the province, with over 2 million people participating, significantly promoting the ideological revolution of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, represented by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Guizhou. The revolutionary masses have a more concrete and clear understanding of the great significance of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the importance of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat to prevent capitalist restoration. More than 90% of the units in the province have achieved revolutionary great unity; the pace of revolutionary three-in-one combination has also significantly accelerated, with more than 90% of the counties and 80% of the districts establishing revolutionary committees. The Cultural Revolution has driven various aspects of work and promoted production. Last year, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented harvest, with grain production increasing by more than 10% compared to the bumper year of 1966. Industrial production also increased compared to 1966. The entire province is thriving. All of this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting pointed out that in the new year, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, immediately transmit and firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must "lead in three aspects": lead in studying, lead in applying, and lead in propagating.

The meeting emphasized that in the new year, we must continue to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes and establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. All levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary mass organizations, the military, factories, rural areas, schools, government agencies, neighborhoods, and even families must establish such classes. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee must take the lead in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the standing committee of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee participating in one session of the study class, acting as both leaders and students, and leading the struggle against selfishness and revisionism.

The meeting focused on discussing the issue of establishing the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which emphasizes the connection between theory and practice. The meeting pointed out that connecting theory with practice means studying Chairman Mao's works and focusing on the "application" aspect. Whether or not to apply what is learned from Chairman Mao's works is a fundamental attitude and stance of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao. One must bring the problems encountered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and one's own active thoughts to the study of Chairman Mao's works, deeply understand, frequently check, and timely summarize.

The meeting pointed out that we must continue to deeply develop revolutionary criticism, further promote and consolidate revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units and departments. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must have specialized teams to lead the revolutionary criticism. The main leaders must personally lead, timely deploy, regularly discuss, and seriously implement.

In addition, the meeting also made comprehensive arrangements for "rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building," "supporting the army and loving the people," "promoting revolution and production, work, and preparedness," and "consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Comrade Li Zaichan, the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: The tasks in the new year are more arduous, more glorious, and more magnificent. More deeply and broadly developing the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the fundamental guarantees for achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Fully implementing and fully applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, we must place the full implementation and full application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything.

The attendees unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "be both an official and a common person," improve their work style, go deep into reality, and widely connect with the masses. They must be models in studying, implementing, propagating, and defending the latest instructions.
