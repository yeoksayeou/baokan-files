The Albanian "Unity" newspaper recently published an editorial celebrating the great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1967.

The article states that 1967 was a year of great victories for the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have successfully advanced the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, destroying the remnants of the bourgeoisie and feudalism in the political and ideological spheres, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strengthening the powerful weapon in the hands of the working masses to defend the fruits of victory and carry the revolutionary cause, socialism, and communism to completion. The Chinese people have not only defeated the enemies within the country but have also dealt a decisive blow to the enemies abroad, first and foremost the American imperialists and their accomplices—the modern revisionists centered around the Khrushchev group in the Soviet Union. They attempted to sabotage the people's regime in China from within and drag China back onto the revisionist road of capitalist restoration.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has promoted an unprecedented leap in production among the broad masses of workers, and has raised the consciousness and initiative of the great, talented Chinese people. Workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are striving to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production," achieving one victory after another in all spheres of life. 1967 became a year of record-breaking agricultural production in China. Industrial production saw significant growth, producing tens of thousands of high-quality new products. Great achievements were also made in science and strengthening national defense.

The successful test of the hydrogen bomb was a brilliant achievement in China's science and technology in 1967. This brilliant achievement was accomplished in record time, shocking scientists around the world. The article points out that all these victories, along with the principled and revolutionary foreign policy consistently pursued by the glorious Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, have made People's China into a great giant, a stronghold of socialism and communism, and the most reliable pillar of all revolutionary forces in the world.

The article concludes by saying that the visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu to China in 1967 further strengthened and consolidated the friendship between Albania and China. The Albanian people sincerely wish for this great friendship to last forever and become ever stronger, for the benefit of the peoples of our two countries and our two nations, and for the victory of revolution and socialism throughout the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is like the rising sun, illuminating the bright path to complete liberation for the revolutionary peoples of the world. Revolutionary fighters in Latin America are determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of Latin America.

    阿《团结报》热烈欢呼中国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    强大的中国是世界革命力量最可靠支柱
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》最近发表编辑部文章，热烈欢呼中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，一九六七年在无产阶级文化大革命中取得伟大胜利。
    文章说，一九六七年是七亿中国人民取得伟大胜利的一年。中国人民高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜，胜利地推进了无产阶级文化大革命，在政治思想方面摧毁了资产阶级和封建主义的残余，打倒了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，巩固了无产阶级专政，加强了掌握在劳动群众手中用以保卫胜利果实并把革命事业、社会主义和共产主义伟大事业进行到底的这一强大武器。中国人民不仅战胜了国内的敌人，而且给了国外的敌人，首先是美帝国主义者及其帮凶——以苏联赫鲁晓夫集团为中心的现代修正主义者以决定性的打击。他们企图从内部破坏中国的人民政权，把中国拉回到资本主义复辟的修正主义道路上去。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命促进了广大劳动群众生产的空前大跃进，提高了伟大的、天才的中国人民的觉悟和首创精神。工人、农民和革命知识分子努力贯彻毛泽东同志关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在生活的各个领域里取得了一个接着一个的胜利。一九六七年成了中国农业生产破纪录的一年。工业生产有了显著增长，生产了成千上万种高质量的新产品。在科学和加强国防力量方面，也取得了伟大的成就。
    氢弹的试验成功是一九六七年中国科学技术的一个辉煌成就。这一辉煌成就是在创纪录的时间内取得的。它使全世界科学家感到震惊。文章指出，这一切胜利以及光荣的中国共产党和中国政府一贯遵循的原则性的和革命的外交政策，使人民中国变成了伟大的巨人，社会主义和共产主义的坚强堡垒以及世界上一切革命力量最可靠的支柱。
    文章最后说，由穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团一九六七年对中国的访问，进一步加强和巩固了阿中友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心祝愿这一伟大友谊永世长存，日益巩固，以造福于我们两国人民和我们两个国家，以利于革命和社会主义在全世界的胜利。（附图片）
