China's Economic and Trade Expo opened grandly in Bamako on the afternoon of the 26th. The enthusiastic people of Mali played drums and danced in the streets and squares opposite the expo, celebrating the development of Sino-Malian friendship. Modibo Keita, Chairman of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution and Head of State of Mali, and Alphonse Massamba-Debat, President of the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) who was visiting Mali, attended the opening ceremony. Among the more than 800 guests were members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, ministers of the Malian government, leaders of various mass organizations in Mali, representatives from various sectors of Bamako, and diplomatic representatives from various countries stationed in Mali.

Modibo Keita delivered a passionate speech at the opening ceremony, praising the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and the deep friendship between China and Mali. He said, "This expo is a new testament to the great friendship between the Chinese people and the Malian people. It shows our people that once the masses are led by a vanguard party that bases its actions on the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism as embodied by the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, the creative genius of the masses can achieve great things." "The great example of the Chinese people will inspire the people of all developing countries who have the courage to forever rid themselves of colonial control."

Modibo Keita spoke about economic and trade cooperation between China and Mali, saying, "We believe that the significant achievements made by the People's Republic of China in our country are valuable fruits of our revolution." He said, "Chairman Mao teaches the world's revolutionaries: 'The people who have won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation.' The Malian people can prove that the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China do not make empty promises. China's aid is the most concrete manifestation of proletarian internationalism, which aids the people of underdeveloped countries in establishing independent economies."

Modibo Keita pointed out that all the great achievements of the Chinese people are due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. He said, "The wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought inspire all those who aspire to build a new society." He concluded with, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! Glory to the Chinese people, and long live the fighting friendship between China and Mali!"

At the opening ceremony, Zhang Ziquan, the head of the expo delegation, spoke about the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. Zhang Ziquan praised the significant achievements made by the Malian people under the leadership of President Modibo Keita in their anti-imperialist struggle, in maintaining national independence, and in national construction. Finally, he wished for the continuous strengthening and development of Sino-Malian friendship.

Following this, President Modibo Keita cut the ribbon to officially open the expo. Accompanied by Liu Helin, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, and Zhang Ziquan, the delegation head, President Keita and President Massamba-Debat, along with other guests, visited the expo with great interest. After the visit, the two presidents wrote in the guest book. President Keita wrote: "The China Economic and Trade Expo fully demonstrates the rapid progress made by Chinese scientists, technicians, workers, and peasants under the guidance of the great thoughts of the genius Mao Zedong. This is a powerful testament to the people of this great country, who are sincere friends of all other countries struggling for their independence. The Malian people warmly applaud the success of this expo." President Massamba-Debat wrote: "Following the 1965 China Expo in Brazzaville, today's visit to the China Expo in Bamako makes me feel that the People's Republic of China has made increasingly undeniable progress. The achievements of China are due to the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, who has mobilized 700 million Chinese people to embark on the glorious path of socialism. Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!"

After the expo opened, the citizens of Bamako enthusiastically rushed into the exhibition hall to visit.

    凯塔总统和马桑巴—代巴总统参观展览会并在留言簿上题词
    据新华社巴马科二十七日电　中国经济贸易展览会二十六日下午在马里首都巴马科隆重开幕。热情的马里人民敲着鼓，在展览会对面的街道上和广场上载歌载舞，祝贺中马两国友谊的发展。马里保卫革命全国委员会主席、国家元首莫迪博·凯塔和正在马里访问的刚果（布）共和国总统马桑巴—代巴出席了开幕仪式。在八百多名来宾中，还有马里保卫革命全国委员会委员、政府部长、马里各群众组织的负责人、巴马科各界代表和各国驻马里的外交代表。
    莫迪博·凯塔在开幕仪式上发表了热情洋溢的讲话，赞颂伟大的毛泽东思想和中马两国深厚的友谊。他说，这个展览会是“中国人民对马里人民的伟大友谊的新的证明”。
  “它向我国人民表明，一旦人民群众得到一个把自己的行动建立在由毛泽东主席的伟大思想所体现了的马克思列宁主义革命原则基础上的先锋党的领导，人民群众的创造性的天才能做出什么事情”。“伟大的中国人民的榜样必将鼓舞正在发展道路上的各国人民，他们有勇气永远摆脱殖民主义控制。”
    莫迪博·凯塔在谈到中马两国的经济和贸易合作时说：“我们认为，中华人民共和国在我国所作出的重大成就，是我国革命的宝贵成果。”他说：“毛主席教导世界革命者说：‘已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争’，马里人民可以证明，中国共产党和中华人民共和国不是说话不算数的。中国的援助是无产阶级国际主义所应有的、在行动上援助不发达国家的人民建立独立经济的最具体的表现。”
    莫迪博·凯塔指出，中国人民所取得的一切伟大成就归功于毛主席的英明领导。他说：“毛主席的英明领导和毛泽东思想鼓舞着所有向往建立一个新社会的人们。”他最后高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！”“光荣归于中国人民，中马两国的战斗友谊万岁！”
    展览团团长张子泉在开幕式上讲话时，介绍了中国人民在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利。张子泉赞扬马里人民在莫迪博·凯塔总统的领导下，在反帝斗争和维护民族独立以及国家建设中所取得的显著成就。最后，他祝愿中马两国友谊不断增强和发展。
    接着，莫迪博·凯塔总统为展览会的开幕式剪了彩。在中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林和张子泉团长的陪同下，马里总统和刚果（布）总统以及其他客人怀着极大的兴趣参观了这个展览会。参观后，两位总统在留言簿上题了词。莫迪博·凯塔总统写道：“中国经济贸易展览会充分显示了中国科学家、技术人员、工人和农民在天才的毛泽东的伟大思想指引下所迅速实现的巨大进步，这是一切正在为争取自己的独立而斗争的其他各国人民的诚挚的朋友——这个伟大国家的人民的强大的证明。马里人民热烈欢呼这次展览会的成功。”马桑巴—代巴总统写道：“继一九六五年中国在布拉柴维尔的展览会之后，今天对巴马科的中国展览会的参观访问，使我感到中华人民共和国取得了越来越无可置疑的进步。中国的成就归功于毛泽东主席的伟大思想，毛泽东主席把七亿中国人民发动起来，走上了光荣的社会主义的道路。中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    展览会揭幕以后，巴马科市民兴高采烈地涌进展览大厅进行参观。
