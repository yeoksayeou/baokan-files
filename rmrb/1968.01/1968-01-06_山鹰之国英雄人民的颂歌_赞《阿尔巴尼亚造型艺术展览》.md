In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "Albanian Sculptural Art Exhibition" from the heroic land of eagles has been grandly displayed in Beijing.

This is the first large-scale art exhibition held by Albania in our country, featuring 160-plus pieces of sculpture, oil paintings, propaganda posters, prints, and cartoons. These artistic works, which are rich in revolutionary thought and skilled in artistic techniques, are the fruits of Albanian artists' deep immersion in life and the masses, under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the guidance of Comrade Enver Hoxha. They are an ode to the heroic Albanian people's victorious march on the road of revolutionization.

The Gun is the Key to Political Power

The most prominent feature of this exhibition is the depiction of armed struggle and the path of transforming the world with the gun. Many works passionately sing the praises of the heroic Albanian people's daring to fight, daring to win, and fearless sacrifice during the years of national liberation and anti-imperialist, anti-fascist wars. The large sculpture "The Heroes of Vig" by S. Hadarli vividly portrays the heroic image of five partisan fighters who chose to stand and die rather than kneel and live. Surrounded by enemies, these brave partisans glare defiantly at the enemy, tightly gripping their guns to defend their positions, fully embodying the fearless heroism of the Albanian people who would rather die than surrender. The oil painting "Skrapar, February 1944" by F. Hazeu depicts the first shock brigade's partisans, led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, receiving a heavy combat mission with unwavering confidence and excitement. Since the artist himself was a partisan who personally participated in this battle, the depiction is particularly vivid and lifelike. In the sculpture "Invincible Partisans" by O. Beshgari, the partisan fighting bravely against the enemy embodies the spirit of "overcoming all enemies," which is a concentrated portrayal of the Albanian people's victory over all enemies with the gun. These works vividly reflect the glorious truth that the Albanian people used revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence and gained freedom and liberation.

One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun

Under the wise leadership of the Labor Party, the Albanian people have adhered to the policy of self-reliance, smashed the various plots of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The sculpture "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" by H. Dule portrays a towering giant holding both a pickaxe and a gun, symbolizing the Albanian people's ambition and determination to build and defend their country. The oil painting "At the Black Metal Smelting Plant" by C. Ceka vividly depicts workers striving for progress and passionately building socialism. In the oil painting "Going to Work" by C. Shoshi, we see a group of female cooperative members stepping out of their homes to work, greeting the dawn with a heroic demeanor. The painting "Socialist Labor Hero Adam Reka and His Comrades" by B. Mela portrays the brilliant image of a new generation of socialists.

The exhibition also features many works that directly embody the spirit of the call made by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha in February of last year for "further revolutionizing the party and the government." The propaganda poster "Eliminating Old Customs and Religious Superstitions" by C. Zeqa is a striking and excellent work. In the painting, an Albanian revolutionary holds up a torch, burning religious superstitions, backward customs, and the old forces that discriminate against women to ashes. Through this painting, we see that millions of Albanian people are holding up the torch of revolutionization, forming a vast revolutionary army, and marching forward bravely along the path indicated by the beloved leader Comrade Hoxha.

Long Live the Eternal Friendship Between China and Albania

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Though we are separated by mountains and rivers, our hearts are united.' The two countries of China and Albania are far apart, but our hearts are connected." Albanian artists have passionately praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania in their works. From "The Textile Workers of the Mao Zedong Textile Combine" (by H. Nalbani), "Red Guards" (by M. Zerami), "Chinese Peasants" (by A. Mado), and "The Smelters of China and Albania Together" (by I. Shehu), we see the Albanian brothers' love for Chairman Mao, praise for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and cherishing of the fighting friendship between the working classes of the two countries. As Chinese workers, we particularly like the print "The Smelters of China and Albania Together." Look, in the picture, two large hands holding steel rods are tightly clasped together, fully embodying the unshakable unity between the workers of the two countries and their heroic spirit of transforming the world.

The smelters of China and Albania together forge not ordinary steel ingots and iron parts, but the iron-clad mountains of socialism and the cornerstone of communism.

The workers of China and Albania together make imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries tremble with fear; they make the revolutionary people of the world rejoice and fight with high spirits.

Through their artistic practice, Albanian artists have truly made literature and art serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We warmly applaud the achievements of Albanian literary and art warriors and wish them new victories on the road of revolutionization. We will definitely, following the teachings of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, firmly unite with the Albanian brothers, fight together, and win together, to carry the world revolution to the end!

    山鹰之国英雄人民的颂歌
    ——赞《阿尔巴尼亚造型艺术展览》
    北京永定机械厂　鲁迅文艺组
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性胜利的阵阵凯歌声中，来自英雄山鹰之国的《阿尔巴尼亚造型艺术展览》，在北京隆重展出了。
    这是阿尔巴尼亚第一次在我国举办的大型艺术展览，展品有雕塑、油画、宣传画、版画、漫画等一百六十余件。这些具有革命思想内容和熟练艺术技巧的战斗的艺术品，是阿尔巴尼亚文艺工作者，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导和霍查同志的教导下，深入生活，深入群众，在造型艺术创作方面取得的丰硕成果。它是对阿尔巴尼亚的英雄人民在革命化的道路上胜利前进的颂歌。
    枪杆子里面出政权
    表现武装斗争和枪杆子改造整个世界的道路，是这次展览的最突出的特色。许多作品都热情地歌颂了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在争取民族解放和反对帝国主义法西斯的战争年代里，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，不怕牺牲的革命英雄主义精神。萨·哈达利的大型雕塑《维固的英雄们》，生动地刻划了“宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生”的五个游击队员的英雄群像。这群英勇的游击队员被敌人包围后，横眉怒视着敌人，紧握枪杆子坚守着阵地，充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民宁死不屈的大无畏的英雄气概。法·哈泽乌的油画《斯喀日斯卡，一九四四年二月》，描绘了在穆罕默德·谢胡同志领导下的第一突击旅的游击战士们，接受艰巨的战斗任务时的坚定的信心和激动的情景。由于画家本人就是一个游击队员，亲自参加过这次战斗，所以描绘得非常生动逼真。在奥·白斯加里的雕塑《战无不胜的游击队》中，那个英勇地与敌人搏斗的游击队员，显示了“压倒一切敌人”的战斗精神，这正是阿尔巴尼亚人民用枪杆子战胜一切敌人的集中写照。这些作品，生动地反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，获得自由解放的光辉的真理。
    一手拿镐　一手拿枪
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的英明领导下，坚持自力更生方针，粉碎了帝修反的种种阴谋，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上取得了辉煌的成就。海·杜莱的雕塑《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》塑造了一个紧握镐和枪的顶天立地的巨人，它象征着阿尔巴尼亚人民建设祖国，保卫祖国的壮志和决心。契·捷卡的油画《在黑色金属冶炼厂》，形象地描绘了工人们奋发图强，满腔热情地建设社会主义的动人情景。在柴·肖希的油画《上工》里，我们看到了一群女合作社员迎着朝霞，愉快地走出家门去参加劳动的豪迈的形象。巴·梅莱的《社会主义劳动英雄亚当·雷卡和他的同伴们》，则塑造出了社会主义一代新人的光辉形象。
    展览中还有许多作品，直接地体现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和霍查同志去年二月所作的关于“党和政权进一步革命化”的号召的精神。契·泽加的宣传画《破除旧习惯和宗教迷信》是幅引人注目的好作品。画面上，一个阿尔巴尼亚革命者高举火把，将宗教迷信、落后习俗和歧视妇女的旧习惯势力烧成灰烬。通过这一幅画，使我们看到了千千万万的阿尔巴尼亚人民正在高举革命化的火把，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，沿着敬爱的领袖霍查同志所指引的道路奋勇前进。
    中阿友谊万古长青
    伟大的领袖毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者在他们的作品中，热情地歌颂了中阿两国人民的战斗友谊。从《毛泽东纺织联合企业的纺织女工》（哈·纳尔巴尼作）、《红卫兵》
  （蒙·泽拉米作）、《中国农民》（阿·马道作）和《中阿两国的铸工们在一起》（依·谢胡作）等作品里，我们看到了阿尔巴尼亚兄弟热爱毛主席、赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命、珍视中阿两国工人阶级战斗友谊的一片心意。作为中国的工人，我们特别喜欢版画《中阿两国的铸工们在一起》。看，画面上，两只拿钢钎的大手紧紧握在一起，充分表现了中阿两国工人之间坚如磐石的团结和改天换地的豪迈气概。
    中阿两国的铸工们在一起所共同铸出的不是普通的钢坯铁件，而是社会主义铁打的江山和共产主义的奠基石。
    中阿两国的工人们在一起，就使帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派胆战心惊；使世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬。
    阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者通过自己的艺术实践，真正做到了使文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。我们热烈欢呼阿尔巴尼亚文艺战士们取得的成就，并预祝他们在革命化的道路上获得新的胜利。我们一定按照敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导，坚决和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把世界革命进行到底！
