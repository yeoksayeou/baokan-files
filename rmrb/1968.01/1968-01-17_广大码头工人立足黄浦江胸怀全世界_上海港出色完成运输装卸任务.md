Shanghai Port's proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses, in the storm of the "January Revolution" power seizure, have highly demonstrated the political responsibility of the masters of the state, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving tremendous results. Last year, they successfully completed the transportation and loading tasks, with the port's total import and export cargo volume reaching the highest level in history, exceeding the previous year by 10.2%. Currently, they are full of enthusiasm, striving to be the best, and continuing to seize the revolution and promote production, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the brilliant year of 1968.

Shanghai Port is the gateway to China's foreign trade, with trade relations with more than 100 countries and regions across five continents. With the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's international reputation has further increased, and support for the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has been continuously strengthened, leading to a significant increase in Shanghai Port's foreign trade loading tasks. Last July and August, the number of foreign ships arriving at Shanghai Port exceeded the usual amount by more than onefold, and the loading tasks were extremely heavy. The dockworkers of Shanghai Port, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, expressed with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao: "We dockworkers stand by the Huangpu River with a global vision. We dare to climb mountains of knives and descend into seas of fire. We must support the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of Vietnam, Albania, and the world with our swift loading and unloading actions. We will strive for glory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and make Chairman Mao proud." The broad revolutionary masses treated the dock as a battlefield, denouncing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pishan and Cao Qiuqiu, while racing against time to load and unload cargo. Many veteran workers gave up their rest days and worked continuously. Some retired workers also eagerly joined the battle. The responsible comrades of the newly established revolutionary committees at various levels and the responsible comrades of various revolutionary mass organizations all insisted on fighting on the production frontline. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, and revolutionary factions from sister units, all revolutionary workers in the port overcame numerous difficulties, ensured the smooth operation of the port, and significantly shortened the loading and unloading time. In front of the facts, some foreign captains respectfully said, "I have now personally witnessed the victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution."

"People's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of history's progress." The reason Shanghai Port has achieved such great results is that: the broad revolutionary workers closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and advance bravely. In March and April last year, the port gradually achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Starting in April last year, the port from top to bottom persistently held rectification study classes and Mao Zedong Thought study classes. All new and old revolutionary leading cadres and half of the revolutionary workers have studied in these classes. All departments in the port put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work. The broad revolutionary workers study every day, study everything, study before class, and study after class. They arm their minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, promote ideological revolutionization, seize the revolution, vigorously promote production, and ensure the successful completion of transportation and loading tasks.

    广大码头工人立足黄浦江胸怀全世界
    上海港出色完成运输装卸任务
    新华社上海十六日电　上海港的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在“一月革命”风暴中夺权以来，高度发扬国家主人翁的政治责任感，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了巨大成就。去年他们出色地完成了运输装卸任务，全港完成的外贸物资进出口吞吐量达到历史上最高的一年，超过前年的百分之十点二。目前，他们正鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，进一步抓革命、促生产，决心在光辉灿烂的一九六八年，努力夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    上海港是我国对外贸易的门户，它与五大洲的一百多个国家和地区有着贸易往来。随着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，我国的国际声誉更加增长，我国对亚非拉革命人民的支援不断加强，上海港的外贸装卸任务有了大幅度的上升。去年七、八月间，上海港每天到港的外轮艘数超过通常的一倍，装卸任务十分繁重。有着光荣革命传统的上海港码头工人，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的激情，自豪地表示：“我们码头工人立足黄浦江，胸怀全世界。我们刀山敢上，火海敢下，一定要以快装快卸的实际行动，支援越南、阿尔巴尼亚和世界上一切革命人民的斗争。我们要为无产阶级文化大革命争光，为毛主席争气。”广大革命群众把码头当作战场，一面愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流的滔天罪行，一面争分夺秒地装卸运输。许多老工人放弃工休日，连续工作。有些退休工人，也争着投入战斗。新成立的各级革命委员会负责同志和各革命群众组织负责同志，都坚持战斗在生产第一线。在人民解放军、红卫兵小将和兄弟单位革命派的大力支援下，全港革命职工排除了重重困难，保障了港口的畅通，装卸时间大大缩短。在事实面前，有的外国船长敬佩地说：“我现在亲眼看到了中国文化大革命的胜利。”
      “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。上海港所以能取得这样巨大的成绩，关键在于：广大革命职工紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，奋勇前进。去年三、四月间，这个港就逐步实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合。去年四月开始，全港从上到下坚持不懈地举办了整风学习班和毛泽东思想学习班。全体新老革命领导干部和半数革命职工都在学习班学习过。全港各部门把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，广大革命职工天天学，事事学，班前学，班后学。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，促进思想革命化，狠抓革命，猛促生产，保证了运输装卸任务的胜利完成。
