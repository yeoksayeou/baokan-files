The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist's barbaric attack on a Chinese cargo ship.

The Vietnamese people resolutely strike back at the U.S. imperialists with heavier blows.

Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper points out that the U.S. imperialist's barbaric provocation will only meet with a shameful failure.

	Hanoi, January 9 (New China News Agency) - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 8, strongly protesting the U.S. bandit planes' barbaric attack on the port of Chu Lap in Vietnam on January 3, and the bombing of the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158" docked there, a new war crime.

	The statement pointed out that this action by U.S. imperialism, following its previous attacks on Chinese merchant ships, is a new crime committed against the Chinese people. It has taken another step forward in its conspiracy to provoke war against the People's Republic of China.

	The statement emphasized that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the correct position stated in the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China on January 7, 1968, regarding the U.S. planes' bombing of the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158."

	The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism grossly violated the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and seriously infringed upon the rights of all countries to freely navigate and use various ports at sea.

	The statement warned that the United States must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by its "escalation" of the war.

	Hanoi, January 10 (New China News Agency) - A delegation from the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Vice Chairman Tran Huy Lieu, met with the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Lu Weizhao, on January 9. They angrily condemned the U.S. imperialists' banditry of sending planes to bomb the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158" docked at Chu Lap on January 3.

	Tran Huy Lieu stated that the above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism are a sign of its desperation. The Vietnamese people will follow the teachings of the great leader President Ho Chi Minh and resolutely strike back at U.S. imperialism with heavier blows, achieving a thorough victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He also asked Lu Weizhao to convey fraternal greetings and concern to the crew and wounded of the "Hongqi 158" cargo ship and wished the wounded a speedy recovery.

	Lu Weizhao expressed sincere thanks for the concern shown by the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and the Vietnamese people. He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' mad war provocations against the Chinese people. He said that the Chinese people, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, are ready to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The Vietnam Democratic Republic Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement on the same day, strongly condemning the U.S. bandit planes' barbaric bombing of the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158."

	Tirana, January 9 (New China News Agency) - The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on January 9, strongly supporting the statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on January 7, protesting the U.S. bandit planes' bombing of the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158." It strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' mad policy of hostility towards China.

	The article said that the U.S. bandit planes' new evil deed of bombing the Chinese cargo ship "Hongqi 158" docked at the port of Chu Lap in Vietnam is a serious provocation by U.S. imperialism. It is part of the U.S. imperialists' plan and conspiracy of all-out aggression against the People's Republic of China. The article pointed out that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the failure of the Chinese Khrushchov and the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the great achievements made by People's China in politics, economy, and national defense on all fronts have made the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and international reactionaries anxious and at a loss. The U.S. imperialists, who are suffering more and more severe defeats in the Vietnam War, are now making desperate struggles, trying to find a way out of the dead end they have already fallen into.

	The article pointed out that China is the strongest supporter and most reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. aggressors.

	The article concluded by saying that the Albanian people are extremely indignant at the U.S. bandit planes' barbaric bombing of the Chinese cargo ship. The Albanian people and the fraternal Chinese people are united in exposing and condemning this barbaric act.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》指出美帝的野蛮挑衅只能遭到可耻失败
    新华社河内九日电越南民主共和国外交部八日发表声明，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机三日野蛮袭击越南锦普港，并对停泊在这个港口的中国货船红旗一五八号进行轰炸的新的战争罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义继过去对中国商船的袭击之后的这一行动，是对中国人民犯下的一个新罪行。它在推行对中华人民共和国的战争挑衅阴谋中，又向前迈进了一步。
    声明强调说，越南民主共和国政府完全支持中华人民共和国外交部一九六八年一月七日关于美国飞机轰炸中国货船红旗一五八号的声明中所阐明的正确立场。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的上述罪行极其粗暴地侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权，严重地违反了各国在海上自由往来和使用各个港口的权利。
    声明警告说，美国必须对由它的战争“升级”行动所造成的一切后果承担全部责任。
    据新华社河内十日电以越中友好协会副会长陈辉燎为首的越中友好协会代表团，九日会见中国驻越南大使馆临时代办陆维钊时，愤怒谴责美帝国主义三日又派遣飞机轰炸停泊在锦普港的中国货船红旗一五八号的强盗行径。
    陈辉燎表示，美帝国主义的上述罪行，是它狗急跳墙的表现。越南人民决心遵循伟大领袖胡志明主席的教导，坚决给美帝国主义以更加沉重的打击，夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。他还请陆维钊代办向红旗一五八号货船的船员及伤员转致兄弟般的亲切的慰问，并祝伤员们早日恢复健康。
    陆维钊代办对越中友好协会和越南人民的关怀表示诚挚的谢意，并强烈谴责美帝国主义对中国人民进行的疯狂的战争挑衅。他说，中国人民遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    越南民主共和国商会同日也发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机猖狂轰炸中国货船红旗一五八号的野蛮罪行。
    据新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》九日发表编辑部文章，坚决支持中国外交部七日抗议美国强盗飞机轰炸中国货船红旗一五八号的声明，强烈谴责美帝疯狂敌视中国的侵略政策。
    文章说，美国强盗飞机轰炸停泊在越南锦普港口的中国货船红旗一五八号的新的罪恶行径，是美帝国主义一次严重的挑衅。它是美帝国主义全面反对中华人民共和国的侵略计划和阴谋的组成部分。文章指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进军，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的破产，以及人民中国在政治、经济和国防等各条战线上取得的宏伟成就，这一切使美帝、苏修和国际反动派惶惶不安和手足无措。在侵越战争中遭到越来越惨重失败的美帝国主义者，正在作绝望挣扎，企图在已经陷入的死胡同中寻找出路。
    文章指出，中国是越南人民在反对美国侵略者的斗争中最强大的支持者和坚固的可靠后方。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对美国强盗飞机轰炸中国货船的野蛮行径感到极大愤怒。阿尔巴尼亚人民和兄弟的中国人民同仇敌忾，坚决揭露和谴责这种野蛮行径。
