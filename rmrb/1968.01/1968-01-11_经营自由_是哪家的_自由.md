Title: Whose "Freedom" Is "Operational Freedom"?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "When we make plans, do work, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has six hundred million people. We must never forget this point." Chairman Mao also says: "Prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people."

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, engage in production for the revolution. We cultivate land to support the country's socialist construction and to aid the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world. Our commune is a multi-crop area, primarily producing ramie. Ramie is an important industrial raw material, and many industrial products made from ramie are important export commodities. Based on the state's plan and our brigade's specific situation, we formulate a ramie planting plan. We strive to exceed the quota and deliver more ramie to the state, thus better supporting the country's socialist construction.

However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in this region, influenced by the black wind of "Three Freedoms and One Contract" advocated by China's Khrushchev, deliberately set the production quota very low. They loudly advocate "operational freedom," claiming that as long as 96% of the production quota set by the commune is completed, it is considered "completion" of the state plan. They can then "freely" plant other crops instead of following the state's planned acreage. As a result, just in our brigade, over thirty mu of land have been taken out of the planned acreage to plant other crops, disrupting the state's planned economy and sabotaging socialist construction.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in this region do not implement the state plan and disregard the fundamental interests of the people nationwide. They pursue economic income one-sidedly and shamelessly portray themselves as "caring" for the lives of commune members. They hypocritically say that "operational freedom" is to "increase the income of commune members." This is all deceitful talk. They attempt to corrupt the broad masses of commune members ideologically, making us only see immediate benefits, ignoring long-term interests, only caring for ourselves, and not concerning ourselves with national affairs. This caters to the needs of capitalist forces in the countryside and fosters the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of wealthy peasants.

Due to the rampant "operational freedom," the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in this region even advocate taking various agricultural products to the free market for high-price sales, disrupting market management, and colluding with urban and rural capitalist forces to launch an attack on socialism, bringing great harm to the people in cities and countryside.

"Operational freedom" is the "freedom" to sabotage the state's socialist construction plan, the "freedom" for capitalism to attack socialism, and the "freedom" to foster the development of capitalism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad masses of commune members firmly oppose it!

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, has thoroughly smashed the evil plot of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism in our rural areas. In response to Chairman Mao's great call, the broad masses of commune members, through criticizing "Three Freedoms and One Contract" and the capitalist "operational freedom," have raised their consciousness. In 1967, the state plan for ramie planting was fully implemented. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously said: "This has uprooted the root of revisionism, established Mao Zedong Thought, eradicated the 'selfish' character, and planted the 'public' character!"

### “经营自由”是哪家的“自由”

    “经营自由”是哪家的“自由”
    大新大队原党支部书记　张连贵
    革命造反指挥部负责人　高宜毛
    毛主席教导说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”毛主席又说：“备战、备荒、为人民”。
    我们贫下中农为革命搞生产，种田是为了支援国家的社会主义建设，援助世界被压迫人民的革命斗争。我们公社是多种经济作物区，主要生产络麻。络麻是重要的工业原料，许多用络麻生产的工业品是重要的出口物资。我们根据国家计划要求和本队的具体情况，制订络麻种植计划。我们力争超额交售给国家更多的络麻，就可以更好地支援国家的社会主义建设。
    可是，本地区党内一小撮走资派，在中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”黑风的影响下，故意把产量包得很低，大肆鼓吹“经营自由”，说什么只要完成了公社包产任务的百分之九十六，就算“完成”了国家计划，可以不按国家的计划面积而“自由”种植其它作物。这样，仅我们一个队，就从计划面积中，抽出了三十多亩土地来种其它作物，破坏了国家的计划经济，破坏了社会主义建设。
    本地区党内一小撮走资派不执行国家计划，不顾全国人民的根本利益，片面地追求经济收入，还死不要脸地把自己打扮成“关心”社员生活的样子，假惺惺地说“经营自由”是为了“增加社员的收入”。这完全是骗人的鬼话。他们妄图从思想上腐蚀广大社员，叫我们只看眼前利益，不顾长远利益，只管自己，不问国家大事。这就迎合了农村中资本主义势力的需要，助长了富裕农民的自发资本主义倾向。
    由于“经营自由”的泛滥，本地区党内一小撮走资派竟主张把多种的其它农产品拿到自由市场去高价出售，扰乱市场管理，配合城乡资本主义势力向社会主义发动进攻，给城乡人民带来极大的危害。
      “经营自由”是破坏国家社会主义建设计划的“自由”，是资本主义向社会主义进攻的“自由”，是助长资本主义发展的“自由”。我们贫下中农和广大社员群众坚决反对！
    我们心中的红太阳毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫在我国农村复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。我们广大社员响应毛主席的伟大号召，通过批判“三自一包”和资本主义的“经营自由”，广大社员提高了觉悟，一九六七年种植络麻的国家计划完全落实了。贫下中农都异口同声地说：“这是挖掉了修正主义的根子，立了毛泽东思想，铲除了‘私’字，种下了‘公’字！”
