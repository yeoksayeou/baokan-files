The editorial published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* on New Year's Day, titled "Greeting the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," has greatly inspired the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards in Zhaojiamu Brigade of Donggaocun People's Commune in Pinggu County, Beijing. They immediately gathered to study and discuss the editorial, unanimously shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Everyone agreed that the New Year's editorial, which is radiant with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is the first thunder of 1968, the marching order issued by the proletarian headquarters, and the battle cry for seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone is determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Brigade leader Chen Shaowu said: The New Year's editorial has set forth the general policy and general task for the whole year, pointing out the direction for us. The editorial fully expresses the sentiments of the broad masses of commune members and represents our aspirations. This year, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combine learning with application, and see immediate results. We will do exactly as Chairman Mao says, without the slightest deviation; we will go where Chairman Mao points and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The political leader of the Sixth Production Team, Zhang Bao, said: The editorial proposes to promote and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and further carry out the revolutionary great criticism. This is very important. The poison spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen in our area, such as "material incentives" and "economic leadership," has not been completely eliminated, and the roots of revisionism have not been thoroughly uprooted. We must first do a good job in ideological revolutionization, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances, unite to fight the enemy, and deeply carry out the great criticism of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Old poor peasant and old party member Xu Shenyuan said: The New Year's editorial proposes to rectify the party organization and strengthen party building as an important task, which is another important step in Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In this round of party rectification and education, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more thoroughly, eliminate the harm of the black *Self-Cultivation*, fundamentally change my worldview, become a good party member of Chairman Mao, and serve the people for life.

Red Guard fighter Chen Guihua said: "Support the Army and Love the People" is the great call issued by Chairman Mao. The People's Liberation Army is always our model for learning. Just take the PLA comrades who came to our brigade for support, for example. They hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, and are heart to heart with us revolutionaries. They are our confidants. We Red Guard fighters firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army and will definitely learn well from the PLA, learning their noble qualities and excellent styles such as being loyal to Chairman Mao, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement.

PLA support personnel Zhang Lianfu said: Loving the people is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching and the essence of our people's army. We are determined, together with the revolutionary committee, to vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arm the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and turn Zhaojiamu Brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Through the discussion, the commune members, cadres, and Red Guard fighters were greatly inspired and educated. The more they talked, the brighter their minds became, and the greater their confidence. They are determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, ride the momentum of the great situation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    平谷县赵家务大队社员、干部和支左人员热烈学习座谈元旦社论
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》，极大地鼓舞了北京市平谷县东高村公社赵家务大队的广大贫下中农、革命干部和红卫兵小将。他们立即在一起学习、座谈，同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    大家一致认为，闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的元旦社论，是一九六八年的第一声春雷，是无产阶级司令部发出的进军命令，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗号角。大家决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
    大队领导成员陈少武说：元旦社论给我们提出了全年的总方针、总任务，为我们指明了方向。社论完全说出了广大社员的心里话，表达了俺们的心愿。今年，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力学习毛主席的最新指示，学用结合，立竿见影。毛主席怎样说我们就怎样做，一丝一毫不走样；毛主席指到那里咱打到那里，坚决把文化大革命进行到底。
    第六生产队政治队长张宝说：社论提出要促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，进一步开展好革命的大批判。这是非常重要的。反革命修正主义分子彭真在我们地区散布的什么“物质刺激”、“经济挂帅”等等流毒，还远远没有肃清，修正主义的根子还没有彻底拔掉。我们要首先搞好思想革命化，巩固和发展革命大联合，团结对敌，深入开展对反革命修正主义的大批判。
    老贫农、老党员徐臣元说：元旦社论把整顿党的组织、加强党的建设作为一项重要任务提出来，这是毛主席伟大战略部署又一重要步骤。在这次整党教育中，我一定进一步学好毛主席著作，肃清黑《修养》的毒害，彻底改造世界观，做一个毛主席的好党员，当一辈子人民的勤务员。
    红卫兵小将陈桂华说：“拥军爱民”是毛主席他老人家向我们发出的伟大号召。解放军永远是我们学习的榜样。就拿到咱队支左的解放军同志来说，他们毛泽东思想红旗举得高，毛主席著作学得好、用得好，和咱革命派心连心，是咱贫下中农的知心人。我们红卫兵战士坚决相信和依靠人民解放军，一定好好向解放军学习，把解放军忠于毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等高贵品质和优良作风学到手。
    解放军支左人员张连富说：热爱人民群众是毛主席的一贯教导，是我们人民军队的本质。我们决心和革命委员会一起，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装广大社员和革命干部，把赵家务大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    通过座谈，社员、干部和红卫兵小将受到了极大鼓舞和教育，越谈心里越亮堂，信心越大。他们决心紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，乘大好形势的东风，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
