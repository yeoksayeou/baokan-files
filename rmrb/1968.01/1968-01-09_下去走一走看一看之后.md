Editor's Note: Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the future, cadres should go down to walk and look at things, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be students of the masses." Comrade He Xiaoting's article uses his own specific and deep feelings to illustrate the great significance of implementing Chairman Mao's great teachings in improving cadres' thinking, reforming leadership styles, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

We believe that cadres at all levels should also "go down to walk and look at things," deepen their understanding of Chairman Mao's great teachings through practice, accelerate the transformation of their leadership styles, and truly strengthen their ties with the masses.

Before the autumn harvest, I carried a bag and brought Chairman Mao's works to the front lines of supporting agriculture to understand the work. After going down, I ate from the same pot, slept on the same kang (heated bed), studied, and labored with our soldiers and commune members. In more than twenty days, I visited eleven communes and walked over five hundred miles. It had been many years since I walked such a long distance and came into contact with so many people. I had many thoughts.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "In the future, cadres should go down to walk and look at things, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be students of the masses." After returning from the countryside, I linked this latest instruction from Chairman Mao with actual practice and felt it was particularly close to my heart.

	From the Blisters on My Feet

	On the first day, I went to a nearby commune. From the camp to here, it was only about forty miles, not far at all. I didn't expect that before reaching the destination, my legs started to ache and were a bit uncooperative. Upon arriving at the propaganda team's base, I sat down to talk to the platoon cadres about work, but suddenly felt pain in the soles of my feet. I took off my shoes and socks to find a large blister on my foot.

	Seeing the blister on my foot, I felt uneasy. Before the revolution's victory, the army was always on the move, marching and fighting every day, often covering a hundred or eighty miles, which was quite common. When I was a messenger, my feet were calloused, and I could walk a hundred or two hundred miles in straw sandals without blisters. Sometimes, without straw sandals, I would march barefoot, and if my feet were pierced by thorns, I would rub them on the ground to remove them. The leaders and comrades called me "Iron Feet." After becoming a grassroots cadre, I was also with the soldiers in wind and rain, marching and fighting, and never had any problems with my feet. Today, for the first time, I paid attention to my feet and found that they had changed; they had become delicate.

	That night, after picking the blisters with the help of a kerosene lamp from the landlord, I studied Chairman Mao's works late into the night. I repeatedly pondered a question: Why did my "Iron Feet" get blisters? Chairman Mao said in "On Coalition Government": "Our representative conference should call on the whole Party to be alert and pay attention to every link of work and every comrade, so that they do not become detached from the masses." From Chairman Mao's teachings, I found the reason why my feet had become delicate. After the revolution's victory, the army moved into the city, and with the development of the revolution, my position became higher. I should have used a revolutionary perspective to view this revolutionary change, strengthened my sense of revolutionary responsibility, and been even more closely connected with the masses and better served the people. However, I treated what the people gave me as a personal privilege above the masses. As a result, the higher the position, the bigger the airs, and the less contact with the masses. The change in my feet was first a change in my thoughts. I decided to go among the masses to regain the old calluses.

	After completing the situation in this commune, on the fourth day, I set out for another commune. It happened to rain heavily, and the office comrades wanted to send me a car and a horse, but I refused. I thought: Only by constantly being with the masses, experiencing wind and rain, and rolling in mud, can I better maintain the character of an old soldier.

	The Framework is Gone, the Temper is Gone

	In recent years, I have developed a bad habit of easily getting angry. Whenever I saw something unpleasant, I would get angry and scold people. Comrades have criticized me many times, but I haven't changed. This time, when I went to the Fifth Platoon's propaganda team, I found the root of my tendency to get angry and calmed down.

	Previously, we considered that the class struggle in the countryside was complex, and the propaganda team members were too scattered, making it easy for problems to arise. Therefore, we discussed with the office comrades and formulated a set of regulations. One of them was: Support agriculture personnel must act in groups of three, not individually contact the masses, not individually express biased opinions, and not individually handle problems, etc. This day, when I listened to the Fifth Platoon cadres report the situation, I learned that they had not implemented this regulation but adopted a method of two people covering one brigade. These two people were one in a small team and the other covering the entire brigade, basically acting individually. I heard this and my temper flared. They said there were many advantages to this method, but I didn't listen. I originally wanted to scold them, but it was said that they had consulted the support agriculture office, so I held back my anger. The next day, I went to a nearby brigade to investigate personally and see how this method worked. Upon arrival, it was unexpectedly good. The person in charge of this brigade was a newly enlisted soldier and an old soldier. The new soldier was in a small team, where he set up a small study class of Mao Zedong Thought, personally handled active thoughts, gave lectures, led discussions, answered questions, and solved many problems for the brigade cadres and group leaders. He did a good job. After the new soldier gained experience, the old soldier promoted it in the area, and the two worked together, relying on the masses to make the support agriculture work in this brigade lively and active. The cadres and masses all praised it, unanimously saying: The PLA has done a great job for our brigade's work. I went to another platoon's propaganda team to see what problems arose from fully implementing the office's regulations. Indeed, it was the opposite of the Fifth Platoon's situation. Due to the three people working together, the work was passive, often focusing on points but neglecting the surface, covering the surface but not focusing on points. Especially after implementing the "no" regulations, everyone was afraid of saying the wrong thing and doing the wrong thing, making the propaganda stiff and rigid. The soldiers had many opinions about this regulation, with some comrades saying: "Our hands and feet are tied, and we are swimming in big waves, it's a miracle if we don't drown!" Comparing the two propaganda teams, I was greatly inspired. I deeply understood: "The masses are the real heroes, and we are often childish and laughable." The initial temper to scold people was completely gone.

	From the process of getting angry to calming down, I found the root of my tendency to get angry. It turned out that the temper came from the official airs. With official airs, there is often temper. This official fire is like a campfire, using firewood to support a frame, and the fire rises straight up; the higher the frame, the bigger the temper; remove the frame, let the firewood lie on the ground, and the fire goes out. The revolutionary fire, we must let it burn fiercely in our hearts; this official fire on the frame must be extinguished. Because its harm is too great, it will burn away our proletarian feelings, burn our democratic style, burn the new things growing among the masses, and burn the ties of close unity between us and the masses. The only way to extinguish this official fire is to remove the official airs and honestly be students of the masses. Once the airs are removed, the temper is gone.

	Walking Down to Look is Different from Sitting Up to Look

	This day, I went from the Fifth Platoon to the Eighth Platoon's propaganda team. Before entering the village, I saw the Eighth Platoon soldier Sun Bowei. I asked him where he lived, and he pointed and led us to a lonely, dilapidated house outside the village. Sun Bowei was an old guard of the regiment, who went to the Eighth Platoon as a soldier last year. Seeing him living in this dilapidated house, my old impression of him came back. I thought: This soldier was naughty in the regiment, lazy and careless in life, not very serious about work, and his old habits haven't changed after going to the platoon! I asked him: "It's cold, why not find a good room to live in, and what are you doing here?" He said: "This house was originally where the commune's down-to-the-countryside intellectual youth lived. After the Cultural Revolution began, they were incited by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to run back to the city, and I moved here to do their work. Now, a few youths have returned from the city, and the four quilts on the kang are theirs. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, suffering a bit is nothing!" Sun Bowei's few words made my heart warm. The next day, I went among the masses to further understand Sun Bowei's work situation. The commune members all said in unison: "The PLA came to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, truly bringing us timely rain and solving big problems!" Then everyone praised Little Sun.

	Such a good soldier, why did I see him wrongly in the past? After returning, I thought about this problem over and over again. Finally, I found the answer in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The masses have such great socialist enthusiasm, why in many leading organs, a few months ago, did they not feel it, or feel it so little? Why is the thinking of the leaders so inconsistent with the broad masses? From this lesson, then, how should similar events and problems be handled in the future? The answer is one sentence: Do not detach from the masses, and be good at discovering the enthusiasm of the masses from the essence." Chairman Mao's words hit the nail on the head. Once we detach from the masses, we will inevitably not see the enthusiasm of the masses. Remembering Sun Bowei when he was a guard in the regiment, how much did I know about him? He often came in and out of my room, but I never had a heart-to-heart talk with him. The guard platoon was just a few dozen meters behind my room, but I never went to the platoon to deeply understand his situation. Because of the official airs, I saw only the shortcomings of the soldier that did not match my "official" airs, such as forgetting to fetch water at times, not sweeping the floor at times, playing pranks with comrades at times, etc. Over time, the Sun Bowei in my eyes became a soldier full of faults. This time, going among the masses, seeing with my own eyes what this soldier was doing, and hearing with my own ears the masses' reactions to him, the situation was completely different.

	Other People's Feet Cannot Replace Your Own

	This day, I went to the Eighth Platoon's propaganda team headquarters to understand the situation of the team's self-construction. Arriving at the Eighth Platoon's propaganda team's office, I happened to meet Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Baquan returning from the production team. I sat down and asked him to talk about this aspect of the situation. Zhang Baquan introduced: The Eighth Platoon has an experience in grasping self-construction, which is to promote their own learning by helping commune members study Chairman Mao's works. Then, he reported the experience of how the soldiers helped commune members set up "small classrooms," how they helped commune members carry out revolutionary criticism, and how they guided commune members to study the "Three Articles." After listening to the report, I felt that the Eighth Platoon's experience was very good and wanted to go back and promote it well, without further understanding of this issue.

	That night, Military Affairs Section Deputy Director Zhao told me an important situation, saying: "The Eighth Platoon's experience is good, but there is a problem: after the masses are mobilized, the soldiers are very busy, and some have even squeezed out their own study time. Without any self-study time, the soldiers' revolutionization will also be affected." I asked him: "Where did you learn about this situation?" He said: "After the report, I went to a nearby production team and heard it from the soldiers." Hearing this situation, I was greatly shocked. It seems that this pair of feet is not lazy at all. Investigating and understanding the situation is like mining; only digging to the appropriate depth can you find the ore, and the deeper you dig, the more you get. What is the root cause of this problem and how to solve it? The next day, I also learned from Deputy Director Zhao, visited several production teams, personally talked to the soldiers, and had in-depth discussions with the commune members, gaining a richer understanding and clearer problems. The Eighth Platoon's propaganda team had this problem due to both subjective and objective reasons. Subjectively, some soldiers had the idea of "natural improvement," thinking that studying Chairman Mao's works all day and having Chairman Mao's instructions on their lips would be enough for their own study. Objectively, after the masses' study was carried out, there were more affairs, and the soldiers were temporarily unable to sort them out. With our help, the Eighth Platoon comrades improved their understanding and paid attention to mobilizing and relying on the masses, both improving the masses' study and ensuring self-study time, making the experience more perfect and enriched.

	Chairman Mao said: "All those who undertake guiding work, from the chairman of a township government to the chairman of the national central government, from the brigade leader to the commander-in-chief, from the branch secretary to the general secretary, must all personally engage in practical investigations of social economy, and cannot rely solely on written reports, because the two are different things." This is an absolute truth. From the investigation of the Eighth Platoon's experience, I deeply realized: Other people's feet cannot replace your own. Understanding the situation, of course, can rely on others' feet for indirect investigation, but more importantly, it should rely on your own feet for direct investigation. In the past, sitting at home listening to reports and reading materials, not paying attention to going down to directly grasp first-hand materials. Sometimes going down, but not going to the bottom. This is also a manifestation of "official airs." Now I realize that to sincerely be the people's servant, first of all, the feet must be diligent, and relying on others' feet is not a good servant.

	Do Not Stop at the Sound of Praise

	When I arrived at the Communication Platoon, I had already visited most of the support agriculture propaganda points. The comrades in the platoon heard that I had visited so many points and walked so many miles, and they were particularly concerned and caring. As soon as I arrived, the soldiers all rushed to help with the luggage, clear the room, ask about the cold, and were very affectionate. That night, I participated in the propaganda team's evaluation meeting, and the soldiers praised me in their speeches: "The regiment leader is so busy with work, but still comes to the front lines of support agriculture to mix with us soldiers. We must learn from the regiment leader!" At first, these words of praise sounded pleasant, and I felt that in a year, being able to come down like this to understand the situation was more. However, after the meeting, carefully pondering my thoughts, the more I thought, the more unpleasant it felt. Receiving praise, does it mean that I have deeply entered the masses? I recalled the war years, when I was a cadre in the platoon and company, I was always with the soldiers, marching side by side, fighting shoulder to shoulder, squatting in the same trench, eating from the same pot, never distinguishing between soldiers and officers. The leaders also did this when they came down, mixing with the soldiers, coming and going, everyone was used to it, who would praise it? But now, my coming down to the platoon has become a big deal. Thinking of this, I felt that this praise must be correctly treated. I think that the comrades' praise for the leaders, seeing the leaders go down among the masses according to Chairman Mao's teachings, living and fighting with them, makes them happy and praises them, expressing their concern and love for the leaders, which is understandable. However, for a leader, if you go down to walk and look, the masses praise you, it shows that you have not gone down enough, and in their eyes, you are still a relatively special "leader," and the official airs have not been removed. Therefore, as a leader, you must not stop your feet in the sound of the masses' praise. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, high or low, are servants of the people." If we can often live among the masses and use our actual actions to make the soldiers see that we are not "leaders" but servants of the people, this praise will gradually decrease. If we cannot do this, the soldiers will still praise the leaders for going among the masses as a rare event.

	Why would one stop in the sound of the masses' praise? The fundamental reason is that our thoughts of going among the masses are not deeply rooted. Is it to be an ordinary soldier or an official? Is it to go among the masses or stand above them? Wanting to stop means that my thoughts are still wandering at this crossroads. However, the feet cannot stop; if they do not go among the masses, they will go on the road of bureaucratism; if they do not go on the path of "public," they will go on the path of "private." When our thoughts want to stop, we should be particularly vigilant!

    下去走一走看一看之后
    解放军三○○九部队副团长　和小廷
    编者按　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”和小廷同志这篇文章，用自己的具体深切的感受，说明了贯彻执行毛主席这一伟大教导对于提高干部思想、改进领导作风、密切干部和群众的关系的重大作用。
    我们认为，各级领导干部都应该这样“到下面去走一走，看一看”，从实践中，加深对毛主席这一伟大教导的领会，加速自己领导作风的转变，真正密切同群众的联系。
    秋收前后，我背着挂包，带着毛主席著作，到支农前线了解工作。下去以后，和我们的战士、公社的社员，吃在一个锅里，睡在一个炕上，同学习，同劳动。在二十多天的时间里，转了十一个公社，步行了五百多里。好多年来，没有走过这么远的路，没有接触这么多的群众了，思想上感触很多。毛主席最近教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”从农村回来，联系实际学习毛主席这一最新指示，感到格外亲切。
    从脚泡上发觉的问题
    头一天，我到的是邻近的一个公社。从营房到这里，才四十多里地，并不算远。没想到还没有到达目的地，双腿就开始痠痛，有点不听使唤。到宣传队驻地，刚坐下来，想找连队干部谈谈工作，忽然发觉脚底板上也有点发痛。脱掉鞋袜一看，脚掌上打了一个大水泡。
    看着脚上的水泡，我心里很觉不安。革命胜利前，部队成天行军打仗，每天走百八十里，简直是家常便饭。我当通信员的时候，脚上结起厚厚的茧皮，穿草鞋走一二百里，脚上也没有打过泡。有时候，没有草鞋穿，就光着脚丫子行军，脚底下扎上了荆刺，往地上搓巴搓巴就掉了。首长和同志们都叫我是“铁脚板”。当了基层干部以后，也是风里雨里和战士们一起行军打仗，没有感到脚上有什么问题。今天，头一次注意我的脚，发觉这双脚变了，它变得娇气了。
    晚上，借房东的煤油灯挑完脚泡以后，我翻开毛主席著作学到深夜。我反复思索着一个问题：我这“铁脚板”为啥起了泡？毛主席在《论联合政府》中说：“我们的代表大会应该号召全党提起警觉，注意每一个工作环节上的每一个同志，不要让他脱离群众。”从毛主席的教导里，我找到了脚变娇气的原因。革命胜利了，部队住进了城市，随着革命的发展，自己的职位高了。本来应该用革命的观点来看待这个革命的变化，增强自己的革命责任感，更密切地联系群众，更好地为人民服务。可是，我却把人民给我的看成是高于群众的个人特权。结果，“官”越当越高，架子越摆越大，接触群众就越来越少了。脚变首先是思想在变。我决心到群众中去再把当年的那层老茧皮磨出来。
    这个公社的情况了解完了，第四天又出发到另一个公社。赶巧，天下大雨，机关的同志要给我派车，要给我送马，我都拒绝了。我想：只有不断和群众一起，经过一番又一番的风雨，滚上一身又一身的泥巴，才能更好地保持一个老战士的本色。
    架子打掉了，火气就没有了
    近几年来，我养成了一副爱发火的坏脾气。一看到不顺心的事，就发火，就训人，同志们提出过多次批评也没改掉。这回到五连宣传队，找到了我这爱发火的根子，才把这火气煞了煞。
    前些时候，我们考虑到农村阶级斗争复杂，宣传队的人员太分散了，容易出问题。于是，和办公室的同志研究，规定了一套制度。其中一条是：支农人员要三人一组集体活动，不准单独接触群众，不准单独发表有倾向性意见，不准单独处理问题等。这天，听五连干部汇报情况，才了解到他们根本没有执行这条规定，而是采取两个人包一个大队的办法。这两个人又是一个在小队蹲点，一个在全大队跑面，基本上是单独活动。我一听，火气就直往上冒。他们讲了这样做有许多好处，我都没有听进去。本来又想“训”他们一顿，据说是请示过支农办公室的，只好把火窝了起来。第二天，我到附近一个大队去亲自调查，想看看这个做法到底怎么样。走去一看，真是出乎意料。负责这个大队的是一个刚入伍的新战士和一个老战士。新战士在小队蹲点，他在那里搞了个小型的毛泽东思想学习班，一个人抓活思想，上辅导课，掌握讨论，解答问题，给队里干部和群众组织的头头，解决了不少问题，搞得很象回事。新战士搞出经验后，老战士就在面上推广，两人互相研究，密切配合，依靠群众，把这个大队的支农工作搞得有声有色，非常活跃。干部群众都赞不绝口，一致反映：解放军为咱大队的工作出了大力。我又到另一个连的宣传队，看看完全按办公室的规定搞有些什么问题。果然，和五连的情况相反。由于三个人在一起，工作很被动，常常是抓点顾不了面，跑面抓不了点。特别是执行几个“不准”以后，大家都怕说错话，办错事，宣传搞得死死板板。战士们对这个规定意见很大，有的同志说：“把我们的手脚捆起来，到大风大浪里去游泳，不淹死才怪哩！”两个宣传队一对比，我受到很大启发。深深地领会到：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。开头那股想训人的火，再也发不起来了。
    从这次火起到火灭的过程，我找到了爱发火的原因，原来，火气是从官气来的，有了官气就往往要生火气。这股“官火”，就象野营的篝火一样，用柴禾支个架子，火就直往上窜，架子越高，火气越大；撤掉架子，让柴禾都躺在大地上，火就灭了。革命的烈火，我们要让它在心里熊熊燃烧；这官架子上着起来的“官火”，一定要扑灭。因为它的危害太大，它会烧掉我们的无产阶级感情，会烧坏我们的民主作风，会烧毁群众中生长起来的新生事物，会烧断我们和群众之间亲密团结的纽带。扑灭这官火的唯一办法，是打掉官架子，老老实实做群众的小学生，架子打掉了，火气也就没有了。
    走到下面看和坐在上面看大不一样
    这天，我从五连去八连的一个宣传队，还没进村，就看到了八连战士孙波文。我问他住在那里，他顺手指了指，便把我们领到屯子外面一幢孤零零的破房子里。孙波文是团里的老警卫员，去年下到八连当战士。见他住在这个破房子里，他给我的老印象又出来了。心想：这个战士在团里的时候就调皮，生活懒懒散散，工作不太认真，下连队了，这老毛病还没改！我问他：“天冷了，不找间好房子住，还在这里乘啥凉？”他说：“这房子原来是队里一些下乡知识青年住的，文化大革命开始后，他们受党内一小撮走资派的挑动，跑回城里去了，我搬到这里来住，好做他们的工作。现在，有几个青年已经从城里回来了，炕上这四床被子就是他们的。为了宣传好毛泽东思想，吃点苦算啥！”孙波文几句话，讲得我心里热呼呼的。第二天，我到群众中进一步了解孙波文的工作情况。社员们都异口同声地说：“解放军来宣传毛泽东思想，真给我们送来了及时雨，解决大问题啦！”接着大家给小孙摆开好了。
    这么好的一个战士，我过去为什么把他看偏了？回来后，我翻来复去地想这个问题。最后，还是在毛主席的著作里找到了答案。毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了这样大的社会主义的积极性，为什么在许多领导机关，在几个月以前，居然没有感觉到，或者感觉的那样少呢？领导者们所想的同广大群众所想的，为什么那样不一致呢？以此为教训，那末，今后对于有相似情况的事件和问题，应当怎样处理才好呢？回答只有一句话，就是不要脱离群众，要善于从本质上发现群众的积极性。”毛主席的话，讲到我的要害上了。我们一旦脱离了群众，就必然看不见群众的积极性。回想孙波文在团里当警卫员的时候，我对他了解多少呢？他经常在我房子里进进出出，我并没有推心置腹地和他谈过一次心，警卫班就在我的房后几十米，我就没有到班里深入了解过他的情况。由于摆着官架子看战士，看到的都是不符合我这“官”气的缺点，比如，什么时候忘了打水啦，什么时候没有扫地啦，什么时候跟同志们搞恶作剧啦，等等。久而久之，我眼里的孙波文，就成了到处都是毛病的战士了。这次走到群众之中，亲眼看一看这个战士在做些什么，亲耳听一听群众对他的反应，情况就完全不一样了。
    别人的脚代替不了自己的脚
    这天，我到八连宣传队队部，准备摸一摸宣传队自身建设的情况。到了八连宣传队的办公地点，正好遇见副连长张宝泉从生产队回来。我就坐下来请他谈谈这方面的情况。张宝泉介绍说：八连抓自身建设有一条经验，就是通过帮助社员学习毛主席著作来推动本身的学习。接着，他汇报了战士们怎样帮助社员办“小课堂”，怎样帮助社员搞革命大批判，怎样辅导社员学习“老三篇”的经验。听完汇报后，我感到八连的这条经验很不错，想回去好好推广一下，再没想到对这个问题作深一步的了解。
    晚上，军务股赵副股长给我讲了一个很重要的情况，他说：“八连的经验好是好，就是有个问题，群众发动起来后，战士们忙得够呛，有的把自己学习的时间都挤掉了。没有一点自学的时间，战士革命化也是要受影响的。”我问他：“这个情况是从哪里了解到的？”他说：“听完汇报后，到附近生产队转了一趟，听战士们讲的。”听了这个情况，使我很受震动。看来，这双脚是一点也懒不得的。作调查，了解情况，就象采矿一样，只有掘到应有的深度，才能发现矿藏，掘得越深，得到的东西就越多。这个问题到底是怎么产生的，又怎么解决呢？第二天，我也学习赵副股长，跑了几个生产队，亲自找战士谈心，跟社员交谈，又做了一番深入的了解，情况就更丰富，问题也更清楚了。八连宣传队出现这个问题，有主观上的原因，也有客观上的原因。从主观上看，有的战士存在着“自然提高”的思想，认为一天到晚帮助社员学习，毛主席著作不离身，毛主席的指示不离口，自己还学习不好吗！从客观上看，群众的学习搞起来后，事务事多了，战士们一时没有摆开。经过我们的帮助，八连的同志提高了认识，并注意发动和依靠群众，既搞好了群众的学习，自学的时间也有了保证，经验就更加完善和充实了。
    毛主席说：“凡担负指导工作的人，从乡政府主席到全国中央政府主席，从大队长到总司令，从支部书记到总书记，一定都要亲身从事社会经济的实际调查，不能单靠书面报告，因为二者是两回事。”这是一个千真万确的真理。从八连经验的调查中，使我深刻地认识到：别人的脚是代替不了自己的脚的。了解情况，固然可以依靠别人的脚作间接的调查，但更重要的是要依靠自己的脚作直接的调查。过去，坐在家里听汇报，看材料，不注意走下去，直接掌握第一手材料。有时走下去了，也走不到底。这也是一种“官气”的表现。现在认识到，要真心诚意地做人民的勤务员，首先要勤在脚上，假脚于人，是当不好这个勤务员的。
    不能停留在赞扬声中
    我到通讯连的时候，已在大部分支农宣传点转了一圈了。连里的同志听到我转了这么多点，走了这么多路，对我特别的关心，特别的爱护。一到这里，战士们都抢着帮助拿东西，腾房子，问寒问暖，非常亲切。晚上我参加宣传队的讲评会，战士们在发言中对我七嘴八舌地表扬开了：“团首长工作那么忙，还辛辛苦苦到支农第一线上来，和我们战士打成一片，我们一定要向团首长学习！”对战士们这些赞扬话，开始听起来很顺耳，觉得一年之中，自己能下来这样走上一趟，了解情况就多了，和群众的关系就好了。可是开完会仔细琢磨自己的想法，越想越不是滋味。受到了表扬，深入群众就做到家了吗？我回想战争年代，在连里营里当干部的时候，成天和战士们一起，行军脚跟脚，打仗肩并肩，蹲在一个战壕里，吃在一个锅里，从来不分你是兵我是官，首长们下来也是这样做普通一兵，跟战士们滚得火热，来也好，去也好，大家都习以为常，哪里还赞扬什么呢？可是现在，自己下一次连队，却成了不得了的事了。想到这些，觉得这个赞扬必须正确对待。我想，对战士们的表扬要一分为二。从同志们来说，看到领导干部按照毛主席的教导，下到群众中去，和他们生活在一起，斗争在一起了，他们感到高兴，加以赞扬，表达他们对领导同志的关怀和热爱，这是可以理解的。但是，对一个领导来说，你到下面走一走，看一看，群众就加以赞扬，说明你下去的还是太少了，在他们的眼里，你还是一个比较特殊化的“首长”，官架子还没有打掉。所以，作为领导干部，千万不要把自己的脚步停留在群众的赞扬声中。毛主席教导我们说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。如果我们能够经常生活于群众之中，用自己的实际行动，使战士们看到我们不是什么“首长”，而是全心全意为人民服务的勤务员，这种赞扬声就会逐渐少起来，假如我们做不到这一点，战士们还是要把领导干部深入群众当成稀罕事来赞扬的。
    为什么会在群众的赞扬声中停步，最根本的是我们深入群众的思想扎根不深，是做普通一兵，还是当官做老爷；是深入到群众之中，还是高踞于群众之上，想停步说明我的思想还在这个十字路口上徘徊。但是，脚是停不住的，不往群众当中走，就往官僚化的道路上走；不往“公”字路上走，就往“私”字路上走。当我们思想上想停步的时候，应该特别警惕！
