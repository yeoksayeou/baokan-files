Under the loving care of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and guided by Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 7350 Unit of the Air Force stationed in Zhejiang has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great instruction to "support the broad masses of the left," closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and unswervingly executed the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting factions." Together with the steadfastly left-supporting brother units, they have made important contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang.

Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao and Resolute Implementation of His Latest Instructions is the Strong Proletarian Party Spirit

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For a Communist, this means standing on the side of the Party, standing on the side of party spirit and party policy."

The 7350 Unit deeply felt in the course of struggle that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring masses, and are the guiding principles for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Loyalty to Chairman Mao and faithful execution of his latest instructions are our fundamental stance and our proletarian party principles.

Last October, after receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in North China, Central China, and East China, the soldiers and officers said excitedly: "This is the highest battle command!" "This is the compass for navigation!" The headquarters suspended work, the pilots suspended training, and the "three supports" and "two military" personnel assembled at a run. The remote detachments immediately sent people to convey the instructions and quickly carried out study and implementation. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in factories, schools, and communes in Hangzhou swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary great unity, doing painstaking ideological and political work. The factories, schools, and communes where the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams were stationed quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Hangzhou No. 7 Middle School received Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary great unity at 11 p.m., immediately gathered the revolutionary youngsters living in the school, and called the students scattered in the streets and alleys to the school, studying until 3 a.m. Following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two revolutionary mass organizations reached an agreement on revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity. Soon, the revolutionary committee of the school was established.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and unswervingly execute the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting factions," one must have a firm proletarian stance and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "support the broad masses of the left," the 7350 Unit immediately went deep into the masses, conducting in-depth investigations and research on more than 80 major mass organizations in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses. When a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party in Zhejiang Province used various despicable means to try to suppress the proletarian revolutionary masses at a critical moment, they resolutely stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the revolutionary leftists, braving the wind and waves, and actively supporting the left in various ways. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party hated and feared their resolute left-supporting actions, spreading various rumors and slanders; inciting the deceived masses to attack the left-supporting personnel, disrupting military-civilian unity. The greater the pressure, the more steadfast the soldiers' stance. They bravely fought against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie.

The military training detachment stationed in Xiaoshan, under the combined soft and hard pressure from the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, adhered to revolutionary principles. They broke through numerous obstacles, went to the streets, and entered factories and rural areas, arming the proletarian revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, educating and winning over the deceived masses, and exposing the tricks and schemes of the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, contributing to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xiaoshan County.

The 7350 Unit adhered to proletarian party spirit and implemented the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting factions." Regardless of which revolutionary mass organization, they supported and assisted actions in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some people criticized them, saying they were "mixing things up" and "not having a clear banner." The comrades of the 7350 Unit said: "We want the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not the banner of factionalism. Supporting the left, not supporting factions, is in line with the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and is a clear banner!" Some people maliciously instigated, saying: "The 7350 Unit was once close to the revolutionary rebels, but now they are not close to the revolutionary rebels." The comrades of the 7350 Unit said: "We were, are, and will always be close to the revolutionary masses. Precisely because we are close to them, we must help the revolutionary ranks overcome factionalism." They insisted on this clear proletarian party spirit stance and, together with the steadfastly left-supporting brother units, helped the broad revolutionary workers and Red Guards quickly achieve revolutionary great unity by system and department.

Arming the Masses with Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Strengthening Party Spirit, Overcoming Factionalism, and Building an Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao Proletarian Revolutionary Army

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the revolutionary track of the proletariat. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The 7350 Unit believed that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were the revolutionary track of the proletariat. They resolutely guided the revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance according to the track indicated by Chairman Mao.

When the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued the battle call for revolutionary criticism, they quickly helped various revolutionary mass organizations establish leadership bodies for revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. At this time, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party used anarchism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to sow discord, create divisions, and even instigate armed struggles, attempting to muddy the waters and shift the direction of the struggle. The 7350 Unit, together with the steadfastly left-supporting brother units and revolutionary masses, studied the "May 16 Circular" formulated by Chairman Mao and the important speech by Comrade Jiang Qing on September 5 last year, making everyone realize that they must politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrow and expose China's Khrushchev, thoroughly purge his counter-revolutionary poison, and occupy all positions with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the theme and main issue of the Cultural Revolution and the direction of the struggle. Regarding Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must follow closely and absolutely not take the wrong path. We must see through the enemy's tricks and never be deceived. The more the enemy fears our revolutionary criticism, the more we must carry out revolutionary criticism. The left-supporting units and revolutionary masses quickly launched a magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary masses deeply felt in the struggle that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment was victory.

The 7350 Unit felt that the process of guiding the revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment was a process of painstaking ideological and political work. They did not seek simplicity and convenience, nor did they fear twists and turns. They patiently did ideological and political work, raising the revolutionary masses' awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao said: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit. This must be resolved."

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Hangzhou Boiler Factory correctly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, requiring the revolutionary masses to start from education to liberate a batch of cadres. However, due to the influence of anarchist trends, some masses' thoughts were not clear at first, and the comrades in the propaganda team resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and did not compromise with anarchist trends. They actively helped the revolutionary masses study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making everyone realize that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues was a need of class struggle and a need for the victory of the Cultural Revolution. They had heart-to-heart talks with the masses whose thoughts were not clear, sometimes even ten or more times. They also helped the cadres study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, correctly handle their relationship with the masses, correctly handle themselves, and bravely stand out to revolutionize. The factory quickly established a three-in-one combination revolutionary committee, which was the earliest one in Hangzhou's factories and enterprises.

The left-supporting personnel of the 7350 Unit always paid attention to doing ideological and political work for the heads of mass organizations, widely having heart-to-heart talks, understanding the ideological situation of each person, and timely helping them solve real ideological problems, encouraging them to be the vanguards of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The main leaders of the unit often had heart-to-heart talks with them, jointly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and jointly criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

The 7350 Unit believed that our left-supporting work should not only support the revolutionary masses in overthrowing the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party but also, together with the revolutionary masses, criticize and repudiate revisionism, solve worldview problems, and build an unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao proletarian revolutionary army.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes are good battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and good classrooms for strengthening proletarian party spirit and overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The 7350 Unit, together with the brother units, helped the revolutionary masses extensively establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing the masses to educate themselves. They established classes at the provincial, county, factory, school, and street levels, and even among the families of workers and staff. Many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams also assisted the revolutionary masses in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields and tea mountains, with both full-time and part-time, full-day and night school classes, in various forms and blooming everywhere.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of academic style is a very important issue, the first important issue. 'Without a scientific attitude, that is, without the attitude of unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, it is called no party spirit, or incomplete party spirit.'"

The 7350 Unit, together with the brother units, assisted the revolutionary masses in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" to strengthen the revolutionary academic style. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Hangzhou Steel Plant, in order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, from last August to now, helped the revolutionary masses hold more than 100 (times) Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Before each class, they held many investigation meetings to understand the living thoughts of the students. Each class emphasized what attitude should be taken towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the first lesson. They repeatedly stressed learning for use, using what was learned, consciously criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and touching the soul. Everyone said: This private matter, that private matter, not using Chairman Mao's instructions after learning them, and not being consistent in words and deeds, is the biggest private matter. A cadre of a mass organization, who was once attacked by a deceived comrade, would specially find faults with this comrade and kept a "small account book." He studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and immediately implemented them in practical actions, tearing up the "account book," finding this comrade to have a heart-to-heart talk, and giving him a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Chairman Mao said: "Turning verbal Marxism into practical Marxism in life will not have sectarianism." Because the academic style was correct, factionalism was fiercely criticized, party spirit was strengthened, all the hills in the factory were leveled, and more than 95% of the masses united. Because factionalism was overthrown, everyone objectively and comprehensively understood the cadres, correctly handled the cadres, and a large number of revolutionary cadres were quickly liberated. Not long ago, the revolutionary committee of the factory was born. The revolution and production presented a great situation. The revolutionary masses reviewed the struggle of the past year and deeply felt: "Thanks to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army helping us overthrow factionalism, otherwise, Chairman Mao's latest instructions could not be implemented."

In the Mass Struggle, Actively Learning and Applying Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Transforming Worldviews, and Establishing a Firm Proletarian Party Spirit

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Learning Marxism, not only from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can truly learn it." In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the 7350 Unit resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, organizing the troops to learn Chairman Mao's great instructions on the Cultural Revolution in the great storms and waves of the masses' struggle. In the unit, they extensively spoke about the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great achievements of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards. They planned to organize cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members to go to the streets to read big-character posters and listen to debates; to go to factories and rural areas, to eat, live, and work with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, and to criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie together. The certain radar detachment of a certain regiment stationed on the top of a mountain far from any village or shop, while maintaining year-round combat readiness, also actively organized political wilderness training in stages, going to the masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and strengthening the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines.

"Say a thousand, say ten thousand, it's not as good as going to the masses' struggle to temper oneself." Cadres and soldiers, seeing and hearing the revolutionary masses' great exposure, denunciation, and criticism of China's Khrushchev and the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Zhejiang region, and studying Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and his series of great instructions on the Cultural Revolution, the more they studied, the clearer their minds became, and the more they saw clearly. They hated the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party to the bone and became more and more intimate with the daring-to-revolutionize and daring-to-rebel proletarian revolutionary masses. The education of the struggle between the two lines made everyone understand who to overthrow under the dictatorship of the proletariat, who to revolutionize, and how to revolutionize. Therefore, cadres and soldiers could firmly stand on the proletarian stance in the complex class struggle, and as soon as they intervened in the local Cultural Revolution, they stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses with clear banners.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." He also calls on us: "To criticize and repudiate revisionism."

In the "three supports" and "two military" work, the 7350 Unit, together with the masses, exposed and criticized revisionism, constantly transformed worldviews, and strengthened proletarian party spirit. They said: "Criticizing and repudiating revisionism with the masses is the hardest test, the strictest teacher, and the deepest soul-touching." The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the 11th Middle School encountered two long-opposed revolutionary mass organizations. A larger organization was relatively close to the propaganda team, while a smaller organization was distant. The propaganda team promoted their revolutionary great unity, and the smaller organization said this was compromise and moderation. In this situation, some comrades did not like this organization and did not want to approach it. The leadership of the propaganda team discovered this trend and believed that "private matters" were at play. They immediately conducted a "frontline rectification," repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," and fiercely criticized and repudiated revisionism. Everyone believed: Supporting or not supporting a revolutionary mass organization should not be based on how they treat "me." They brought this problem to the classes and, together with the revolutionary youngsters, exposed and criticized revisionism. Through repeated patient ideological and political work, they finally promoted the revolutionary great unity of the two organizations.

Some propaganda teams of the 7350 Unit also made mistakes in their left-supporting work, but they fiercely criticized and repudiated revisionism, openly criticized themselves when they made mistakes, and were not afraid of losing face. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the Hangzhou Agricultural Chemical Factory made some mistakes soon after entering the factory. After the regiment party committee discovered this, several party committee members, together with the propaganda team, sincerely criticized themselves to the revolutionary mass organizations, sought criticism, and quickly corrected their mistakes. The revolutionary masses were moved to say: "The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are so loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Such a unit we can trust."

The Key Lies in Having a Leadership Body that is Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao and Has a Firm Proletarian Party Spirit

The party committee of the 7350 Unit honestly listens to Chairman Mao's words. They study and understand each of Chairman Mao's instructions word by word and sentence by sentence, and resolutely act according to them. The main responsible comrades of the party committee said: "Regarding Chairman Mao's instructions, one must repeatedly study and deeply understand them, and cannot be satisfied with a superficial understanding. One must not take them out of context and take what one needs." After Chairman Mao published the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, they seriously studied it, resolutely stood on the side of the proletarian headquarters represented by Chairman Mao, personally went to the detachments to explain the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and used their personal experience of revolutionizing with Chairman Mao to extensively speak about Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness, and the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses, to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." The party committee of the 7350 Unit faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, and before intervening in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang, they went among the revolutionary masses, established deep proletarian feelings with the revolutionary youngsters, investigated and understood the situation of the struggle between the two lines in society, and established deep proletarian feelings with the revolutionary rebels. After intervening in the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they maintained close contact with the revolutionary masses, consulted with the masses on matters, sought advice from the masses, and honestly acted as the masses' students. They enthusiastically nurtured new things in the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit. The revolutionary masses created good experiences in revolutionary criticism and establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and they quickly helped to summarize and hold on-site meetings to widely promote them.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The army should have soldiers participate in study classes." The leaders at all levels immediately established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, absorbing soldiers, cooks, and workers to participate, helping themselves to criticize and repudiate revisionism. They deeply felt: "A wall separates us, and a mountain separates our hearts. Always being with the masses makes us connected heart to heart. We cannot be separated from the masses for a moment!" Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and new and old contradictions in the Party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party would stop."

The party committee of the 7350 Unit, following Chairman Mao's instructions, took "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key, and with Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon, actively carried out ideological struggles within the Party. They fiercely criticized and repudiated revisionism within the party committee, firmly established the spirit of "daring," dared to uphold principles, and unanimously decided to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. When bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism grew within the revolutionary ranks, they fiercely criticized and repudiated revisionism, guarded against the influence of factionalism, and, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, quickly made the decision to "strengthen proletarian party spirit and support the left, not support factions." After the "three supports" and "two military" work achieved results, they fiercely criticized and repudiated revisionism within the party committee, did not lie down on their laurels, and quickly made the decision to learn from the brother units. In just two months, they led the unit to hold more than 100 symposiums, humbly seeking the criticism of the people. They constantly discovered and overcame weak links, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were fully implemented.

The party committee of the 7350 Unit felt that to make the party committee truly become a battle command post unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, it was to rely on struggle. Whoever went against Chairman Mao's instructions would be struggled against, and any thoughts or actions that did not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions would be struggled against. The relationship between party committee members could only be proletarian political relationships and could not be vulgar personal relationships. Precisely because they constantly carried out ideological struggles within the Party, they ensured that the party committee held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented each of Chairman Mao's battle commands, and advanced vigorously and unceasingly!

In the past year, the broad soldiers and officers of the 7350 Unit, in the great storms and waves of class struggle, tempered their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao with red hearts, achieving a double harvest in "three supports" and "two military" work and ideological revolutionary construction. The broad soldiers and officers are determined to, in the new year, even higher hold up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions, criticize and repudiate revisionism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, be humble and modest, and strive for more, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a better job in "three supports" and "two military" work, and make new contributions to the people in the great struggle to achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    不折不扣地落实毛主席的最新指示
    坚定不移地执行“支左不支派”的原则
    ——记驻浙江空军7350部队“三支”“两军”工作先进事迹
    在我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的亲切关怀下，在毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命一系列最新指示的指引下，驻浙江空军七三五○部队坚决执行毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地落实毛主席的最新指示，坚定不移地执行“支左不支派”的原则，和坚决支左的兄弟部队一起，为浙江地区无产阶级文化大革命作出了重要贡献。
      无限忠于毛主席，坚决落实
    毛主席最新指示就是坚强的无
    产阶级党性
    毛主席教导我们：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”
    七三五○部队在斗争实践中深深体会到：毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示，代表着无产阶级和广大劳动人民最根本的利益，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利的指南。忠于毛主席，忠实执行毛主席最新指示就是我们最根本的立场，就是我们无产阶级党性原则。
    去年十月，接到毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区无产阶级文化大革命时所作的最新指示，指战员们激动地说：“这是最高的战斗命令！”“这是导航的罗盘！”机关暂停办公，飞行员暂停训练，“三支”“两军”人员跑步集合，边远连队马上派人去传达，迅速进行学习和贯彻执行。派驻杭州工厂、学校、公社的毛泽东思想宣传队，雷厉风行地落实毛主席关于革命大联合的指示，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。毛泽东思想宣传队所在的工厂、学校、公社都迅速实现革命大联合。驻杭州市第七中学的毛泽东思想宣传队，晚上十一点接到毛主席关于革命大联合的指示，马上和住在学校的革命小将一起，把分散住在大街小巷的同学叫到学校，一直学到凌晨三点。遵照毛主席最新指示，两派革命群众组织达成了以教学班为基础的革命大联合协议，很快实现了革命大联合。不久，成立了校革命委员会。
    不折不扣地落实毛主席最新指示，坚定不移地执行“支左不支派”的原则，就要有坚定的无产阶级立场，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召以后，七三五○部队立刻深入群众，对浙江省和杭州市八十多个较大的群众组织进行了深入的调查研究，坚决支持无产阶级革命派。当浙江省党内一小撮走资派使用种种卑鄙手法，妄图把无产阶级革命派打下去的关键时刻，他们坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，和革命左派肩并肩，心连心，顶逆风，战恶浪，用各种方式积极支持左派。党内一小撮走资派对他们坚决支左的行动，恨得要死，怕得要命，散布各种流言蜚语，造谣中伤；煽动受蒙蔽群众围攻支左人员，破坏军民团结。压力越大，指战员们立场越坚定。他们英勇地同党内一小撮走资派，同资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。
    驻萧山的某部军事教导连，在党内一小撮走资派软硬兼施的压力下，坚持革命原则。他们冲破重重阻力，走上街头，深入工厂、农村，用毛主席最新指示武装无产阶级革命派，教育争取受蒙蔽群众，揭穿了党内一小撮走资派的阴谋诡计，为萧山县的无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。
    七三五○部队坚持无产阶级党性，贯彻执行了“支左不支派”的原则。不论是那一派革命群众组织，符合毛泽东思想的言行就拥护、就支持，不符合毛泽东思想的言行就帮助、教育，坚决同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争。这时有的人对他们提出种种非议，说这是“和稀泥”，“旗帜不鲜明”。七三五○部队同志们说：“我们要的是毛泽东思想的旗帜，不要派性的旗帜，支左不支派，符合伟大领袖毛主席的指示，正是旗帜鲜明！”有的人又别有用心地挑拨说：“七三五○部队过去和革命造反派心连心，现在和革命造反派不心连心了。”七三五○部队的同志们说：“我们过去、现在和将来，都同革命群众心连心，正因为心连心，才要帮助革命队伍克服派性。”他们坚持这种鲜明的无产阶级党性立场，和坚决支左的兄弟部队一起，帮助广大革命职工和红卫兵小将很快地实现了按系统、按部门的革命大联合。
        用毛主席最新指示武装
    群众，增强党性，克服派性，
    建设无限忠于毛主席的无产阶
    级革命大军
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    七三五○部队认为，毛主席一系列的最新指示，就是无产阶级革命的轨道。他们坚决引导革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，按照毛主席指引的轨道前进。
    当以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出了革命大批判的战斗号令，他们很快帮助各革命群众组织，建立了革命大批判和斗批改的领导班子，深入地开展革命大批判。这时，党内一小撮走资派利用革命队伍内部无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，挑拨离间，制造分裂，甚至挑起武斗，企图把水搅浑，转移斗争大方向。七三五○部队同坚决支左的兄弟部队和革命群众一起，学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和江青同志去年九月五日重要讲话，使大家认识到必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，彻底肃清其反革命流毒，用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，这是文化大革命的主题、正题，是斗争大方向。对毛主席的伟大战略部署，必须紧跟，绝不能正路不走走歪路。要识破阶级敌人的阴谋，万万不可上当。敌人越是害怕我们抓革命的大批判，我们就越要抓革命大批判。支左部队和革命群众迅速掀起了一个波澜壮阔的革命大批判的高潮。广大革命群众在斗争中深深体会到，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。
    七三五○部队体会到，引导革命群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的过程，就是进行艰苦细致思想政治工作的过程。他们不图简单省事，不怕曲折反复，耐心做思想政治工作，提高革命群众执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性。
    毛主席说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”
    七三五○部队驻杭州锅炉厂毛泽东思想宣传队，正确贯彻毛主席的干部政策，要求革命群众从教育入手解放一批干部。但是，由于有些群众受无政府主义思潮的影响，一时思想不通，宣传队的同志坚决照毛主席最新指示办事，不向无政府主义思潮妥协让步。他们积极帮助革命群众学习毛主席最新指示，使大家认识到：落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，是阶级斗争的需要，是文化大革命胜利前进的需要。他们对思想不通的群众一次二次甚至十多次谈心。他们还帮助干部学习毛主席最新指示，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，勇敢站出来革命。厂里很快成立了三结合的革命委员会，在杭州工厂企业中是最早的一个。
    七三五○部队支左人员时刻注意做群众组织头头的思想政治工作，广泛地谈心，一个一个地摸清思想情况，及时帮助他们解决现实思想问题，鼓励他们要当斗私批修的带头人，增强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。部队主要负责同志经常同他们谈心，共同学习毛主席最新指示，共同斗私。
    七三五○部队认为，我们支左，不仅要支持革命群众打倒党内一小撮走资派，而且要和革命群众一起，斗私批修，解决世界观问题，建设无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命大军。
    毛泽东思想学习班，是斗私批修的好战场，是加强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的好课堂。七三五○部队和兄弟部队一起，帮助革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，发动群众自己教育自己。他们在省里办、县里办、工厂办、学校办、街道办，在职工家属中也办。许多毛泽东思想宣传队，还协助革命群众把毛泽东思想学习班办到田头，办到茶山，有脱产的，也有业余的，有全日的，也有夜校，多种形式，遍地开花。
    毛主席教导我们：“学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”“没有科学的态度，即没有马克思列宁主义的理论和实践统一的态度，就叫做没有党性，或叫做党性不完全。”
    七三五○部队和兄弟部队一起，协助革命群众办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓树立革命学风。驻杭州钢铁厂毛泽东思想宣传队，为了落实毛主席最新指示，从去年八月到现在，帮助革命群众举办了一百多个（次）毛泽东思想学习班。每期学习班开办前都要开许多次调查会，了解学员活思想。每期学习班，都把应该以什么态度对待毛主席最新指示作为第一课。反复强调为用而学，学了就用，自觉斗私，狠触灵魂。大家说：这个私，那个私，对毛主席的指示学了不用，言行不一，是最大的私。有一个群众组织的骨干，过去因为一个受蒙蔽的同志围攻过自己，就专找这同志的岔子，记了一个“小账本”。他学习毛主席最新指示，立刻落实到实际行动上，主动撕了“账本”，找这个同志交心，并送给他一套《毛泽东选集》。毛主席说：“把口头上的马克思主义变成为实际生活里的马克思主义，就不会有宗派主义了。”由于学风正，狠斗了派性，加强了党性，全厂铲平了山头，百分之九十五以上的群众联合了起来。由于斗倒了派性，大家实事求是地全面地认识干部，正确对待干部，大批革命干部很快解放出来。不久以前，厂里革命委员会已经诞生。革命、生产出现一派大好形势。革命群众回顾一年来斗争的道路，深有体会地说：“多亏解放军同志帮助我们斗倒了派性，要不，毛主席最新指示就不能落实。”
        在群众斗争中活学活用
    毛主席最新指示，改造世界观，
    树立坚强的无产阶级党性
    毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”七三五○部队在文化大革命初期，就坚决遵循毛主席教导，组织部队到革命群众斗争的大风大浪中去学习毛主席关于文化大革命的伟大指示。在部队大讲无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，大讲无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将的伟大功勋。他们有计划地组织干部、战士、职工、家属上街看大字报、听辩论；到工厂、农村，和工人、贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，同学毛主席最新指示，同批资产阶级反动路线。住在前不靠村、后不靠店的大山顶上某团雷达三连，他们在坚持常年战备的同时，还主动分期分批下山搞政治野营，到群众中学习毛主席最新指示，加强两条路线斗争观念。
      “说一千，道一万，不如到群众斗争的激流中去锻炼。”干部战士耳闻目睹革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫及浙江地区党内一小撮走资派滔天罪行的大揭发、大声讨、大批判，再学习毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和关于文化大革命的一系列伟大指示，越学心越明，眼越亮，对党内一小撮走资派恨之入骨，对敢革命敢造反的无产阶级革命派越来越亲。两条路线斗争教育，使大家懂得了在无产阶级专政条件下革谁的命，谁来革命，怎么革命，因而干部战士在复杂的阶级斗争中，能坚定地站稳无产阶级立场，一介入地方文化大革命，就旗帜鲜明地站到无产阶级革命派一边。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。又号召我们：“要斗私，批修”。
    七三五○部队在“三支”“两军”中和群众一起亮私斗私，不断改造世界观，加强无产阶级党性。他们说：“和群众一起斗私，考题最过硬，教员最严格，触及灵魂最深刻。”驻十一中学的毛泽东思想宣传队，遇到两个长期对立的革命群众组织，一个较大的组织，对宣传队比较亲近，一个较小的组织对宣传队有距离。宣传队促进他们实现革命大联合，这个较小的组织就说这是搞调和，搞折衷。在这种情况下，有的同志对这个组织看不惯，不愿接近。宣传队领导上发现这个苗头，认为听我的话我就热，不听我的话我就冷，这是
  “私”字作怪。他们马上进行“火线整风”，反复学习“老三篇”，狠斗私心。大家认为：对一个革命群众组织支持与不支持，决不能用对“我”的态度怎么样作标准。他们带着这个问题到班级中和革命小将一起亮私、斗私，经过反复耐心的思想政治工作，终于促使这两个组织实现了革命大联合。
    七三五○部队有些宣传队，在支左工作中也产生过缺点错误，但是他们狠斗“私”字，有错就公开检讨，不怕丢面子。驻杭州支农化工厂毛泽东思想宣传队，进厂不久，发生了一些错误，某团党委发现之后，几个党委委员带着宣传队向革命群众组织作了诚恳的检讨，征求批评，迅速改正。革命群众感动地说：“解放军同志这样忠于毛主席，坚决照毛主席指示办事，这样的部队我们信得过。”
      关键在于要有一个无限忠于
    毛主席、有坚强无产阶级党性的
    领导班子
    七三五○部队党委老老实实听毛主席的话。他们对毛主席每一个指示，一字一句地学习，一字一句地领会，坚定不移地照办。党委主要负责同志说：“对毛主席指示一定要反复学习，深刻领会，不能满足于一知半解。更不能断章取义，各取所需。”毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报，他们认真学习，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部一边，亲自下连宣讲党的八届十一中全会精神，用自己跟毛主席干革命的亲身体会，大讲毛主席英明伟大，大讲毛主席革命路线无比正确，揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”七三五○部队党委忠实执行毛主席这一指示，还在介入浙江地区文化大革命之前，他们就到革命群众中去，和革命小将在一起，调查了解社会上两条路线斗争的情况，和革命造反派建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。介入地方无产阶级文化大革命之后，他们又一直和革命群众经常保持密切的联系，遇事和群众商量，向群众请教，老老实实当群众的小学生。他们热情扶植群众中的新生事物，尊重群众首创精神。革命群众创造了革命大批判和举办毛泽东思想学习班的好经验，他们迅速帮助总结，召开现场会广泛推广。
    毛主席最近指示我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加。”各级领导马上办起毛泽东思想学习班，吸收战士、炊事员、职工参加，帮助自己斗私批修。他们深有体会地说：“身隔一道墙，心隔一重山，经常和群众在一起，就和群众心心相连，我们一时一刻也不能脱离群众啊！”
    毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”七三五○部队党委遵照毛主席指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛泽东思想为武器，经常积极开展党内思想斗争。他们在党委内狠斗“私”字，大立“敢”字，敢于坚持原则，一致下定决心，誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线。当革命队伍中资产阶级、小资产阶级派性滋长时，他们狠斗“私”字，警惕派性的影响，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，迅速作出了“加强无产阶级党性、支左不支派”的决定。当他们“三支”“两军”工作取得成绩之后，他们在党委内狠斗“满”字，不躺在“九个指头”上睡觉，迅速作出向兄弟部队学习的决定。在短短两个月中，他们领导部队召开了一百多次座谈会，虚心征求人民群众的批评。不断发现和克服薄弱环节，保证毛主席最新指示条条落实，全面落实。
    七三五○部队党委体会到，要使党委真正成为一个无限忠于毛主席的战斗指挥部，就是要靠斗。谁违背了毛主席的指示就向谁斗，那一点想法、作法不符合毛主席指示，就向那一点想法、作法斗。党委成员之间只能是无产阶级的政治关系，决不能搞成庸俗的私人关系。正是由于他们不断开展党内思想斗争，才保证了党委高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，雷厉风行地执行毛主席每一项战斗号令，朝气蓬勃，不断前进！
    一年来，七三五○部队广大指战员在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锤炼了无限忠于毛主席的赤胆红心，取得了“三支”“两军”工作和思想革命化建设的双丰收。广大指战员决心在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示，斗私批修，加强无产阶级党性，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，全面落实毛主席最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中为人民立新功！
