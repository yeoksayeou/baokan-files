Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no power whatsoever. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people."

Eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, who were unjustly imprisoned by the Ne Win reactionary government of Burma, sang this passage from Chairman Mao's teachings as they were being escorted to the court. Their voices were powerful and resolute, fully expressing the heroic spirit of the overseas Chinese in Burma who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and fearless in the face of the enemy.

The Ne Win reactionary government, acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has since last June committed barbaric anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese fascist atrocities across Burma. To absolve themselves of their crimes and further incite anti-Chinese sentiment, the Ne Win reactionary government began in October to "trial" a large number of innocent overseas Chinese victims.

Chen Bofu, Yang Laoqing, Chen Tianhuang, Lin Chenglong, Huang Zhongquan, Wen Ping, Wang Lianfa, Wang Sixia, Ruan Yongtang, Zeng Yaru, and Chen Diyao are eleven patriotic overseas Chinese who were charged with the fabricated crime of "using violence to obstruct public officials from performing their duties" and were sent to the Rangoon District Court for "trial."

During the "trial," the Ne Win reactionary government employed extremely despicable tactics, hiring a large number of so-called "witnesses" to testify. However, lies are still lies and cannot conceal the ugly face of the Burmese reactionaries. The testimonies of these so-called "witnesses" in court were full of contradictions and loopholes. What the first "witness" said was often refuted by the second, fully exposing the Ne Win reactionary government's guilty conscience and desperate situation.

What terrified the Burmese reactionaries even more was the heroic struggle of the eleven patriotic overseas Chinese in court. These eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, in the face of the enemy, fearlessly exposed the heinous crimes of the Burmese reactionaries in persecuting patriotic overseas Chinese, expressing their profound love for the great leader Chairman Mao, their unwavering faith in the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and their deep love for the socialist motherland.

Patriotic overseas Chinese Yang Laoqing said sternly: "I love Chairman Mao, I love Mao Zedong Thought, I love my motherland. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of us and all revolutionary people around the world. I have always been working to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Burma. I am innocent. This illegal trial is purely political persecution."

Patriotic overseas Chinese Ruan Yongtang, since being arrested in June last year, has been secretly "interrogated" by the enemy twice, each time for more than twenty hours. On the night of July 5, he was beaten until he was covered in blood. Prison officials, to destroy evidence, changed his blood-soaked clothes. This time, he sternly pointed out in court: "Patriotic overseas Chinese wearing Chairman Mao's badges have frightened the Burmese reactionaries, who are politically persecuting us. Overseas Chinese loving their own country and their own leader is a legitimate right." He angrily denounced: "The Ne Win reactionary government wants to shift the blame for its large-scale anti-Chinese actions last June onto us, but it won't succeed. The real culprits are the mobs who burned, killed, and looted, and their behind-the-scenes manipulators. They should be punished by law. They have written the darkest page in the 2,000-year history of Sino-Burmese friendship."

The court "trial" of the patriotic overseas Chinese actually became a place to expose the anti-Chinese ugliness of the Ne Win government. Patriotic overseas Chinese Wang Lianfa bravely exposed in court: "The so-called 'plaintiffs' and 'witnesses' are just various anti-Chinese clowns on stage. They are performing according to the director's pre-arranged script. In the world, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are all anti-Chinese, but they cannot harm a single hair of the Chinese people. The Chinese people despise their anti-Chinese actions, and we take the same attitude towards the anti-Chinese movement stirred up by the Burmese government."

Patriotic overseas Chinese Wen Ping said: "The judge has someone pulling the strings behind him, and the trial is just a play. The play is performed according to the script written in advance, and the 'witnesses' are just reciting lines from the backstage." Wen Ping's speech hit the Burmese reactionaries' weak point, causing the judge to turn pale, flustered, and several times interrupting Wen Ping's speech, muttering, "You can't say that, who is pulling my strings."

The heroic struggle of the patriotic overseas Chinese in the enemy's court demonstrated the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and defended the dignity of the great motherland. Some upright Burmese friends who attended the trial said after hearing the patriotic overseas Chinese's accusations: "In the past, we were deceived by the reactionary press and public opinion, but now we have learned the truth."

"The ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that guides the patriotic overseas Chinese in their unyielding struggle. Among Chen Bofu and the other eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, some are nearly seventy years old, and some are suffering from various illnesses. However, in the enemy's prison, they never forget to study Chairman Mao's works. They have no books, but they recite Chairman Mao's quotations and poems every day. They say: "Studying Chairman Mao's quotations is practical and effective in fighting the enemy." They repeatedly sing the song of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory."

The Ne Win reactionary government, despite repeated protests and warnings from the Chinese people, continues to fabricate various "charges" to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese. However, patriotic overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible! The Ne Win reactionary government's reckless actions will ultimately backfire.

### 心中升起红太阳　心红志坚骨头硬  爱国华侨在敌人法庭上横眉怒斥缅甸反动派

    心中升起红太阳　心红志坚骨头硬
    爱国华侨在敌人法庭上横眉怒斥缅甸反动派
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    十一位被缅甸奈温反动政府无理监禁的爱国华侨，在被押往法庭时高声歌唱这段毛主席语录，歌声雄壮有力，充分地表达了缅甸爱国华侨忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，在敌人面前大义凛然，不畏强暴的英雄气概。
    缅甸奈温反动政府充当美帝苏修的反华走卒，从去年六月开始，在缅甸各地制造了野蛮透顶的反华排华法西斯暴行。为了开脱自己的罪责，并进一步煽动反华，奈温反动政府从去年十月又开始对大批无辜受害的华侨进行所谓“审判”。
    陈伯甫、杨老清、陈天煌、林成隆、黄忠泉、温平、王连发、王思华、阮咏棠、曾亚如、陈甸育等十一位爱国华侨就是被奈温反动政府以所谓“使用暴力阻挠公务人员履行职责”的莫须有罪名，送到仰光地方法院“审讯”的。
    在“审讯”中，奈温反动政府采用了极其卑劣的手段，雇用了大批所谓“证人”出庭“作证”。但是，谎言终究是谎言，丝毫掩盖不了缅甸反动派的丑恶面目。这批所谓“证人”在法庭上的“证词”前后矛盾，漏洞百出，第一个“证人”所说的话，常常被第二个“证人”否定掉，充分暴露了奈温反动政府心虚理亏的狼狈相。
    然而，更使缅甸反动派胆战心惊的是十一位爱国华侨在法庭上进行的英勇的斗争。这十一位爱国华侨在敌人面前，不畏强暴，充分地揭露了缅甸反动派迫害爱国华侨的滔天大罪，表达了他们无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席、无限信仰光焰无际的毛泽东思想、无限热爱社会主义祖国的真挚感情。
    爱国华侨杨老清义正词严地说：“我热爱毛主席，我热爱毛泽东思想，我热爱我的祖国。毛主席是我们和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。我一直在为促进中缅两国人民的友好而工作。我是无罪的。这场非法审讯完全是一场政治迫害。”
    爱国华侨阮咏棠自从去年六月被捕后，被敌人两次秘密“审讯”，每次都达二十多小时。七月五日深夜，他曾被打得遍体鳞伤，血流满面。狱中官吏为了消灭罪证，换走了他的血衣。这次，他在法庭上严正指出：“爱国华侨佩戴毛主席像章，吓破了缅甸反动派的胆，它们对我们进行政治迫害。华侨热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的领袖，这是正当的权利。”他愤怒地控诉说：“奈温反动政府想把它去年六月大规模反华的罪责强加在我们头上是办不到的。真正的罪魁祸首是进行烧杀抢的暴徒和他们的幕后指挥者，他们应当受到法律的制裁。他们给两千多年的中缅友好关系史写上了最最黑暗的一页。”
    “审讯”爱国华侨的法庭，实际上成了暴露奈温政府反华丑态的场所。爱国华侨王连发在法庭上以大无畏的精神揭露说：“所谓‘原告’和‘证人’都不过是舞台上的各种反华小丑。他们是在按着导演的预先安排在表演。在世界上，美帝、苏修和各国反动派都在反华，但是他们不能损伤中国人民一根毫毛。中国人民蔑视它们的反华，对缅甸政府所掀起的反华运动我们也是采取同样的态度。”
    爱国华侨温平说：“法官背后有人在牵线，审判只不过是一场戏而已。戏按事先写的脚本在演，‘证人’只不过是在背台词”。温平的发言打中了缅甸反动派的要害，法官变得脸色苍白，手忙脚乱，几次打断温平的发言，喃喃地说：“你不能这么说，谁在牵我的线。”
    爱国华侨在敌人法庭上的英勇斗争，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的威力，捍卫了伟大祖国的尊严。一些出席旁听的正直缅甸朋友在听了爱国华侨的控诉以后说：“过去我们受了反动报纸舆论的欺骗，现在我们才了解到事实的真相。”
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指导着爱国侨胞进行英勇不屈的斗争。陈伯甫等十一位爱国华侨中，有的是年近七十的老人，有的还受到各种疾病的折磨，但是在敌人的监狱中，他们时刻不忘学习毛主席著作，他们没有书，但每天背诵毛主席语录和诗词。他们说：“学习毛主席语录，在和敌人斗争时，句句实用，字字灵验。”他们反复地唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    奈温反动政府，不顾中国人民的一再抗议和警告，继续在虚构各种“罪名”迫害爱国华侨。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国华侨是不可侮的！奈温反动政府的倒行逆施，最终只能搬起石头打自己的脚。
