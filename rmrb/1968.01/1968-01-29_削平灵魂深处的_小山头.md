One day, during a Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Sheyi Mine in Huainan, Deputy Political Instructor Liu Ruodong from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army studied Chairman Mao's instructions with the heads of the two factions: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolutionary line. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." As young miner Peng Deju studied, he felt increasingly uneasy, his face flushing and then paling. What was the matter?

It turned out that last year, on the eve of National Day, the two major revolutionary factions at the Sheyi Mine had achieved revolutionary great unity from the bottom up, by work teams. Peng Deju, who still harbored feelings for the "hillocks," secretly hid a faction flag, thinking that it might still be useful one day. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions, he realized that this was the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism at work in his mind, and he should voluntarily expose it to everyone to thoroughly overcome it.

Just as Peng Deju was about to stand up and make a self-criticism, suddenly another thought popped into his mind: "Will exposing factionalism and struggling against it in front of so many people affect my prestige?" With this thought, the words he was about to say were swallowed back.

Deputy Political Instructor Liu noticed Peng Deju's expression quickly. After the meeting, the deputy instructor took Peng Deju's hand and said warmly, "Little Peng, let's have a talk!" They walked out side by side, talking as they went. Peng Deju poured out all his thoughts.

The deputy instructor firmly grasped Peng Deju's hand and said earnestly, "Little Peng, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is our ideological enemy. With it, we cannot listen to Chairman Mao's great teachings, we cannot follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, we cannot implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and we may be used by class enemies."

Peng Deju, deeply moved, said, "In the past, why did the two major revolutionary factions in our mine fight 'internal wars' for so long? It was because a handful of class enemies exploited the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in our ranks!"

"Yes!" the deputy instructor continued, "Factionalism ultimately boils down to a 'self' character. To overcome factionalism, we must take 'criticize self and repudiate revisionism' as the key link, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois 'self' character, and thoroughly establish the proletarian 'public' character. Only in this way can we drive factionalism out the door and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds!"

The deputy instructor's words were like a heavy hammer striking a drum, each word and sentence striking Peng Deju's heart, dispelling the fog before his eyes.

The next day, Peng Deju voluntarily handed over the faction flag to the support-left troops and bravely exposed his factionalism and struggled against it at the self-criticism and repudiation of revisionism meeting.

    削平灵魂深处的“小山头”
    一天，在淮南谢一矿毛泽东思想学习班上，解放军某部副指导员刘如东，和两派的头头们一起反复学习着毛主席的指示：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”青年矿工彭德举学着学着，心里愈来愈不安，脸上红一阵白一阵。这是怎么回事呢？
    原来，去年国庆前夕，谢一矿两大派革命群众就由下而上按班组实现了革命大联合。彭德举由于当时还留恋着小山头，就瞒着别人把一面派旗藏了起来，心想可能有朝一日还用得着哩。现在学习了毛主席的指示，他认识到这是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在头脑里作怪，应该主动地在大伙面前亮出来，才能彻底打倒。
    彭德举刚想站起来作自我批评，忽然脑子里又冒上来一个念头：“在这么多人面前亮派性，斗派性，会不会影响自己的威信？”这样一想，话到嘴边又咽回去了。
    彭德举这般神情，很快被刘副指导员发觉了。散会后，副指导员拉着彭德举的手亲切地说：“小彭，咱们去谈一谈吧！”于是，他们俩肩并肩走了出去，边走边谈。彭德举把一肚子的话都倒了出来。
    副指导员紧紧地握住彭德举的手，语重心长地说：“小彭，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是我们的思想敌人。有了它，我们就听不进毛主席的伟大教导，就跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署，就执行不了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就有可能被阶级敌人利用。”
    彭德举听了副指导员的话，深有体会地说：“过去，我们矿上的两大派革命群众，为什么长期打‘内战’，就是因为一小撮阶级敌人利用了我们队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性！”
      “对！”副指导员接着说：“派性归根到底是一个
  ‘私’字。打倒派性，必须以‘斗私，批修’为纲，大破资产阶级的私字，大立无产阶级的公字，只有这样，才能将派性扫地出门，使毛泽东思想在头脑里安家落户！”
    副指导员的这一席话，象重锤敲响鼓，字字句句都敲打在彭德举的心上，拨开了他眼前的迷雾。
    第二天，彭德举主动地把那面派旗送到了支左部队，并大胆地在斗私批修讲用会上亮私斗私。
