Tanzania's Ambassador Hosts Reception to Celebrate the Fourth Anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution; Vice Premier Chen Yi and Others Attend; Ambassador Mwaluko and Qiao Pengfei Speak

New China News Agency, January 13th – Tanzanian Ambassador to China Mwaluko hosted a reception tonight to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant officials Fang Yi, Qiao Pengfei, and Zhou Yiping attended the event by invitation.

Ambassador Mwaluko and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Pengfei both spoke at the reception, which was filled with revolutionary friendship and a spirit of combat unity.

In his speech, Ambassador Mwaluko said, "Chairman Mao's statement that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' was proven in the events of January 12, 1964, in Zanzibar. This statement is equally applicable to the racist fascist regimes in Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Rhodesia, South West Africa, and South Africa, where the minority rules over the majority. Where there is oppression, there will inevitably be resistance."

He said, "The significance of the Zanzibar Revolution lies in the fact that the racist regimes in southern Africa, no matter how strong they appear, will inevitably be overthrown by the millions of Africans they have long trampled underfoot."

Ambassador Mwaluko said, "With the strong support of the 700 million fighting people of China, imperialism and old and new colonialism in Africa will soon be brought to the dock to face judgment. Even the Judas Iscariots in Africa, whom imperialism is currently buying with thirty pieces of silver, will be buried and crushed by the African revolution for liberation, freedom, democracy, and sovereign independence."

Qiao Pengfei, in his speech, warmly congratulated the brave people of Zanzibar for overthrowing the Sultanate with guns and driving out the colonialists. He said, "After the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the anti-imperialist forces have become even stronger."

Qiao Pengfei congratulated the newly established United Republic of Tanzania on its achievements under the leadership of President Nyerere in consolidating national independence, resisting the subversive plots of Anglo-American imperialism, supporting the African national liberation movement, and self-reliantly developing the national economy and culture over the past few years.

Qiao Pengfei said, "The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded the struggles of the African people as our own struggles, their victories as our victories, and as support and encouragement for us. At the same time, we have been doing our utmost to support and assist the struggles of the African people."

He also pointed out that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the Chinese people will be even more powerful in supporting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the African people.

Those who attended the reception by invitation also included diplomatic envoys from African and Arab countries to China.

A documentary film titled "Forward, Zanzibar" was shown at the reception.

    祝贺桑给巴尔人民用枪杆子赶走殖民主义
    坦桑尼亚大使举行招待会庆祝桑给巴尔革命四周年陈毅副总理等应邀出席姬鹏飞姆瓦卢科大使讲话
    新华社十三日讯　坦桑尼亚驻我国大使姆瓦卢科今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝桑给巴尔革命四周年。
    陈毅副总理和有关方面负责人方毅、姬鹏飞、周一萍等应邀出席。
    姆瓦卢科大使和外交部副部长姬鹏飞先后在充满革命友情和战斗团结气氛的招待会上讲话。
    姆瓦卢科大使在讲话中说，毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的名言，在桑给巴尔一九六四年一月十二日事件中得到了证明。在人口中占少数的种族主义法西斯统治下的安哥拉、莫三鼻给、所谓葡属几内亚、罗得西亚、西南非和南非，这句名言也同样是适用的。那里有压迫，那里就必然会有反抗。
    他说，桑给巴尔革命的意义在于这样一个事实：在非洲南部的少数人的种族主义政权，无论看起来如何强大，迟早终将被他们曾长期践踏在脚下的千千万万的非洲人所推翻。
    姆瓦卢科大使说，在七亿战斗的中国人民的有力支持下，在非洲的帝国主义和新老殖民主义不久将被送到算总账的被告席上。甚至帝国主义目前正在用三十块银币收买的他们在非洲的犹大们，也必将被争取解放、自由、民主和主权独立的非洲革命所埋葬和踩得粉碎。
    姬鹏飞在讲话中热烈祝贺英勇的桑给巴尔人民用枪杆子推翻了苏丹王朝，赶走了殖民主义者。他说，坦桑联合以后，反帝力量就更加强大了。
    姬鹏飞祝贺新兴的坦桑尼亚联合共和国，在短短的几年中，在尼雷尔总统领导下，在巩固民族独立、反击美英帝国主义的颠覆阴谋方面，在支援非洲民族解放运动方面，在自力更生地发展民族经济、民族文化等方面，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    姬鹏飞说，中国人民遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把非洲人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看作是自己的胜利，看作是对于我们的支持和鼓舞。同时，我们也一直在竭尽一切努力来支持和援助非洲人民的斗争。
    他还指出，经过我国无产阶级文化大革命之后，中国人民将会更有力地支援非洲人民的反帝革命斗争。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有非洲和阿拉伯国家驻我国的外交使节。
    招待会上放映了纪录片《前进，桑给巴尔》。
