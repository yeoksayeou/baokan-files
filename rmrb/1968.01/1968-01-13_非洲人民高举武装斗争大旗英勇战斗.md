African people are raising the banner of armed struggle and fighting bravely against colonialists. The Mozambican guerrillas have launched a surprise attack on Portuguese colonial forces, and Zimbabwean freedom fighters have won several brilliant ambush battles. The patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea have inflicted heavy casualties on the invaders, and Angolan guerrillas have bravely ambushed three Portuguese colonial forces.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, African people who are raising the banner of armed struggle and fighting bravely against colonialists have recently achieved many victories. Whether in southern Africa's Mozambique, under the rule of white racists in Zimbabwe, or in West Africa's "Portuguese" Guinea, guerrilla fighters frequently launch attacks to eliminate the enemy, and victory reports come in continuously.

According to a statement issued by Mozambican freedom fighters on January 7 in Dar es Salaam, Mozambican freedom fighters are determined to "further intensify the liberation war in 1968." The statement said that in the first week of the new year, Mozambican guerrillas killed thirteen Portuguese colonialists.

In another statement, Mozambican freedom fighters also introduced a battle situation with the enemy. Not long ago, a company of Portuguese colonialists entered the jungle to search for guerrilla bases. The advance platoon of this company was attacked by guerrillas, resulting in eight deaths. The clever and agile guerrillas immediately withdrew after winning the battle. At this time, the enemy behind them used mortars to heavily shell the so-called "guerrilla base," resulting in many Portuguese soldiers being killed and wounded by their own artillery fire.

According to a battle report issued by the Chief Representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in Dar es Salaam, Chihuta, Zimbabwean freedom fighters carried out several brilliant ambush battles against the colonial forces of Southern Rhodesia from January 2 to 7 in the important agricultural area of Bakaroi, about 100 miles north of the capital Salisbury, killing forty-one enemy soldiers and wounding several others.

Chihuta issued another statement on January 4, saying that at the beginning of 1968, Zimbabwean guerrillas launched a series of military actions against the colonial forces of Southern Rhodesia, supported by South African colonial forces. On the morning of January 2, guerrillas engaged in fierce combat with the combined colonial forces of South Africa and Rhodesia in the Zambezi Valley, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

According to a statement issued by the freedom fighters of "Portuguese" Guinea in Algiers, the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea annihilated 131 Portuguese colonial soldiers from November 29 to December 19 last year, including two officers. In a continuous six-day battle in early December last year, dozens of Portuguese invaders were killed and wounded. The patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea also foiled the Portuguese colonialists' plan to establish a bridgehead on the Kubisseko Isthmus.

The brave Angolan guerrillas recently ambushed two Portuguese colonial forces between Linoka River and Sangamongo Village, killing fourteen enemy soldiers and wounding many others. Another Angolan guerrilla unit ambushed a Portuguese colonial military escort team near Laremo in the province of Lunda, killing thirteen Portuguese colonial soldiers.

    非洲人民高举武装斗争大旗英勇战斗
    莫三鼻给游击队奇袭葡萄牙殖民军　津巴布韦自由战士连打几场漂亮的伏击战
    “葡属”几内亚爱国武装痛歼侵略者　安哥拉游击队英勇伏击三支葡萄牙殖民军
    据新华社讯　正在高举武装斗争的旗帜同殖民主义者进行英勇战斗的非洲人民，最近接连取得许多胜利。无论在南部非洲的莫三鼻给，或在白人种族主义者统治下的津巴布韦，还是在西非的“葡属”几内亚，游击战士频频出击消灭敌人，捷报不断传来。
    据莫三鼻给自由战士七日在达累斯萨拉姆发表的一项声明说，莫三鼻给自由战士决心“在一九六八年中进一步加强解放战争。”声明说，在新年的第一周，莫三鼻给游击队打死了十三名葡萄牙殖民主义者。
    莫三鼻给自由战士在另一个声明中还介绍了
  一次与敌人战斗的情况。不久前，葡萄牙殖民主义者的一个连进入丛林，搜索游击队的驻地。这个连的先遣排遭到了游击队的袭击，有八人被打死。机智灵活的游击队在打了胜仗之后就立刻转移了。而这时，后面的敌军用迫击炮朝着所谓的“游击队驻地”猛轰，结果，正在前面进行搜索的葡萄牙士兵挨了自己的炮火，许多人被打死打伤。
    据津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表契胡塔最近发表的一项战报说，津巴布韦自由战士从一月二日到七日的期间，在离首都索尔兹伯里北部约一百英里的重要农业区巴卡罗伊附近，对南罗得西亚殖民军进行了几次漂亮的伏击战，共打死敌人四十一名，打伤若干名。
    契胡塔四日又发表一项公报说，在一九六八年刚刚开始的时候，津巴布韦游击队向南非殖民军支持下的南罗得西亚殖民军采取了一系列军事行动。一月二日清晨，游击队同南非—罗得西亚联合殖民军在赞比西河谷展开激战，使敌人遭到重大伤亡。
    据“葡属”几内亚自由战士在阿尔及尔发表的一项公报说，“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量在去年十一月二十九日到十二月十九日的时间里，共歼灭葡萄牙殖民军一百三十一名，其中包括两名军官。在去年十二月初的一次接连六天的激战中，就打死打伤数十名葡萄牙侵略者。“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量还粉碎了葡萄牙殖民主义者企图在库比塞科地峡上建立一个桥头堡的计划。
    英勇抗击侵略者的安哥拉游击队最近在利努卡河和桑加—蒙戈村之间的地方伏击了两支葡萄牙殖民军，共打死敌军十四人，打伤多人。另一支安哥拉游击队在隆达省拉雷莫附近伏击一支葡萄牙殖民军的护送队，打死葡萄牙殖民军十三名。
