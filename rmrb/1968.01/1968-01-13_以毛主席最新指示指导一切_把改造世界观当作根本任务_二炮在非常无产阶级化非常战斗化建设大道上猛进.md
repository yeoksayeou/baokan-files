The leadership organs and all units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Second Artillery have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, repeatedly studied, thoroughly understood, implemented, and comprehensively carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, strengthened ideological remolding, and promoted the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. A new situation unprecedented in history has emerged.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers use Chairman Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, transform everything, and promote everything. Their boundless love for Chairman Mao's class feelings has greatly increased, their self-awareness in breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness and transforming their worldviews has greatly heightened, and new people nurtured by Chairman Mao Zedong Thought are rapidly growing. The construction of the force as highly proletarian and highly combat-ready has achieved remarkable results.

The great leader Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions are the most powerful ideological weapons for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and are the great program for our winning a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every latest instruction issued by Chairman Mao is enthusiastically studied, swiftly implemented, and resolutely carried out by the broad ranks of officers and soldiers with the greatest determination. Comrades say: Studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest level of awareness, the greatest principle, the purest party spirit, and the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. "Among thousands of books, Mao Zedong's works are the treasure. Among thousands of principles, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are all great truths. Among thousands of important things, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments is the most important. Among thousands of tasks, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest task."

When Chairman Mao issued the battle cry to "support the leftist broad masses," the various units immediately dispatched large numbers of officers and soldiers to the front lines of "three supports, two militaries." They firmly supported the leftists and achieved new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," the various units immediately dispatched large numbers of cadres and soldiers, carrying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, climbing mountains and fording rivers, and went deep into the countryside to propagate the great significance of "grasping revolution and promoting production." A certain unit's steel soldier and first-class meritorious soldier Qu Junshen, while hospitalized due to injury in the line of duty, insisted on "reading Chairman Mao's books every day, listening to every word of Chairman Mao, implementing every instruction of Chairman Mao, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments." He and the revolutionary youngsters together studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, helped the youngsters overcome factionalism, and promoted revolutionary great unity. A certain unit's Seventh Company regarded propagating Chairman Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest act of loving the people. They held large-scale Chairman Mao Zedong Thought study classes in their garrison area, arming the poor and lower-middle peasants with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. People have new thoughts, and the mountains and rivers have new appearances. A remote "muddy village" has become a "Red Flag Village" where the great red flag of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought flies high.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all party members, an issue of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism, and an issue of the work attitude of all party comrades." In the course of struggle, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers deeply feel that: combining theory with practice, studying and applying, seeing immediate results, is the key to implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions. After studying the latest instructions, whether to apply them or not is the fundamental issue of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A genuine proletarian revolutionary soldier must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without the slightest deviation and without the slightest relaxation. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Machikou Commune strictly followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, earnestly implemented the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," and patiently and meticulously carried out ideological and political work, promoting the revolutionary great unity of the two factions, liberating more than ninety percent of the revolutionary cadres, establishing the revolutionary committee of the commune, and achieving double victories in revolution and production. Units tasked with construction, combat readiness, training, and other missions enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" and "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and combat readiness," criticized selfishness and revisionism, carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, purged the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and further implemented Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought and Comrade Lin Biao's proposal to actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, carry forward the three-eighths style, develop the three great democracies, and carry out the four-good company movement and other series of policies and principles emphasizing political construction of the military. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers more firmly walked the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and more consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their work and technology, turning the construction and training sites into large classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Various levels of party committees vigorously promoted the ideological remolding of leading cadres, and according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various units universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldiers participating. Leading cadres put down their airs, regarded soldiers as their teachers, and together with the soldiers engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, further carrying forward the glorious tradition of unity between superiors and subordinates and between officers and soldiers.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers deeply felt that "selfishness" is the great enemy of ideological remolding and the great enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. To comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must sweep away the "selfishness" in one's mind and vigorously transform one's worldview. The officers and soldiers studied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" every day, examined themselves against "The Three Constantly Read Articles" in everything, and applied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" in everything. In the sharp and complex class struggle, they dared to take risks for the revolution and bravely shoulder heavy responsibilities. The broad ranks of revolutionary cadres in the direct organs, at the most acute and intense moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and insisted on principles and struggled regardless of the risks. A certain unit's platoon leader and Communist Party member Zhang Mingjiu, at a critical moment when a several-thousand-pound machine part slipped and seriously threatened the life of a Red Guard youngster, Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessly serving the people" gave him immense strength. He disregarded his own safety, leaped up, and bravely rescued the Red Guard youngster. A certain unit's military doctor Gong Picheng, at all times regarded "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto, studied a little and applied a little. He wholeheartedly served the unit, tirelessly went deep into the mountains and forests to collect samples of poisonous plants and insects, and conducted anti-poison education for the unit, demonstrating the lofty quality of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. He became a soldier praised by cadres, soldiers, and local masses as a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Currently, the leadership organs and all units of the Second Artillery are, on the basis of summarizing the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions over the past year, further vigorously promoting a broader and deeper mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers expressed their determination to take "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong as their example, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strive for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build the Second Artillery into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    以毛主席最新指示指导一切　把改造世界观当作根本任务
    二炮在非常无产阶级化非常战斗化建设大道上猛进
    新华社十二日讯　中国人民解放军第二炮兵领导机关及所属部队广大指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，反复学习、认真领会、条条落实、全面贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，加强思想革命化，活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动出现了空前未有的新局面。
    广大指战员用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，推动一切，无限热爱毛主席的阶级感情大增长，破私立公、改造世界观的自觉性大提高，用毛泽东思想哺育起来的新人迅速成长，部队非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的建设取得了显著的成绩。
    伟大领袖毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，是在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的最强大的思想武器，是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大纲领。毛主席发出的每一条最新指示，广大指战员都是以最高的热情，最快的速度，最大的决心，紧紧跟上，贯彻执行。同志们说：学习毛主席的最新指示，执行毛主席的最新指示，宣传毛主席的最新指示，捍卫毛主席的最新指示，是革命战士最高的觉悟，最大的原则，最纯的党性，是对毛主席最大的忠诚。“千种书，万种书，毛主席著作是宝书。千条理，万条理，毛主席的最新指示条条是伟大真理。千重要，万重要，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署最重要。千件事，万件事，落实毛主席的最新指示是最大的事。”伟大领袖毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号召，各部队立即抽调大批指战员，开赴“三支”“两军”第一线。他们坚定地支持左派，在无产阶级文化大革命中立下新功。毛主席发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，各部队立即抽调大批干部战士，带着毛主席的最新指示，爬山涉水，深入农村宣传“抓革命，促生产”的伟大意义。某部钢铁战士、一等功臣曲俊臣因公负伤住院期间，坚持“毛主席的书天天读，毛主席的话句句听，毛主席的指示句句照办，毛主席的伟大战略部署紧紧跟”。他和革命小将一起学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助小将克服派性，搞好革命的大联合。某部七连把宣传毛泽东思想看作是最大的爱民。他们在驻地大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席的最新指示武装贫下中农。人有新思想，山川换新装。一个偏僻的“窝泥寨”变成了毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬的“红旗寨”。
    毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。”广大指战员在斗争实践中深刻体会到：理论联系实际，学了就用，立竿见影，这是落实毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示的关键。学了最新指示，用还是不用，是忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本问题。真正的无产阶级革命战士，贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，必须一丝一毫不走样，一分一秒不放松。在马池口公社支农的毛泽东思想宣传队，坚决按毛主席的最新指示办事，认真贯彻“支左不支派”的原则，耐心细致地进行思想政治工作，促进了两派的革命大联合，解放了百分之九十以上的革命干部，成立了公社革命委员会，取得了革命、生产双胜利。担负施工、战备、训练和其他各项任务的部队，热烈响应毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”和“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，斗私批修，开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线的流毒，使毛主席的光辉建军思想和林副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，进一步落实。广大指战员更加坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，更加自觉地用毛泽东思想统帅业务，统帅技术，把施工、训练现场变成了活学活用毛主席最新指示的大课堂。各级党委狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，按照毛主席的最新指示，各部队普遍办起了有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班。领导干部放下架子，拜战士为师，和战士一起斗私批修，上下一致、官兵一致的光荣传统得到进一步发扬。
    广大指战员深深体会到，“私”字是思想革命化的大敌，是落实毛主席最新指示的大敌。要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，必须扫除自己头脑里的“私”字，狠抓世界观的改造。指战员们天天学习“老三篇”，事事对照“老三篇”，处处运用“老三篇”，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，敢为革命担风险，勇于挑重担。直属机关广大无产阶级革命派，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最尖锐、最激烈的时刻，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，不管遇到多大风险，一直坚持原则，坚持斗争。某部班长、共产党员章明久在一个几千斤重的机器部件滑落，严重威胁着一个红卫兵小将生命安全的紧急时刻，毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导给了他巨大力量，他不顾自己生命安危，一跃而上，奋勇抢救，使红卫兵小将脱险。某部军医龚丕成，时时刻刻以“老三篇”为座右铭，学一点，用一点。他全心全意为部队服务，不辞辛劳，到深山野林搜集毒草毒虫的标本，给部队进行防毒教育，表现了“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的崇高品质，成为干部战士和当地群众同声称赞的毛主席的好战士。
    目前，第二炮兵领导机关和所属部队广大指战员，在总结一年来全面落实毛主席最新指示的基础上，一个更广泛更深入的活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，正在进一步蓬蓬勃勃地展开。广大指战员表示，决心以“支左爱民模范”李文忠为榜样，条条落实毛主席的最新指示，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为把第二炮兵建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗！
