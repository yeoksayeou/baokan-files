On the afternoon of November 1 last year, at around five o'clock, students from Xiangdao Middle School were returning home as usual. When some students passed by Sha Fu Road in Kowloon Tong, two British police officers stopped and harassed them, conducting searches and deliberately taking their time to gather more students who were passing by, intending to kidnap them collectively.

After setting the trap, the British police quickly brought in a large number of "riot control" forces. As soon as these "riot control" forces arrived, they swarmed like wolves, brutally beating the students with batons, gun butts, and boots. The students, facing these ferocious beasts, showed no sign of fear. They stood tall, shouting angrily, "Protest against the British fascist atrocities!" "Don't hit people!" They held hands and resolutely fought against the enemy. At this moment, many classmates who arrived later rushed to the scene to support their fellow students. A female teacher, Hu Wanshan, who was about to go home, also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and joined the students in the struggle against violence.

The enemy went mad! A female student was pulled out of the crowd by an agent, and a group of thugs struck her head with gun butts and tried to drag her onto a police car. With the support of her classmates, the female student struggled free from the enemy's clutches and ran back to her classmates. At this point, the inhuman British thugs went crazy and fired shots at her.

Amidst the gunshots, the teachers and students loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties, not fearing sacrifice, and strive for victory." They stood up straight, facing the enemy's gun barrels, and shouted passionately, "Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of death!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" They grabbed the batons swinging at them and charged at the enemy time and time again, rescuing their classmates who were being dragged away.

As night fell, when the enemy forcibly kidnapped 52 students and Hu Wanshan onto the police car, the teachers and students recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and singing the song of Chairman Mao's quotations. The powerful slogans and revolutionary songs pierced the night sky, drowning out the howls of the British fascist thugs.

The British fascist atrocities ignited the intense anger of other teachers, students, and parents. About 70 to 80 student parents immediately formed a group and went to the Kowloon City Police Station, denouncing the British thugs' banditry and demanding the immediate release of all the arrested teachers and students. The British police pointed their guns at the parents, ordering them to disperse. The parents shouted loudly, "If you have the guts, shoot!" The parents' heroic demeanor forced the British fascist thugs to lower their guns.

After three hours of struggle, the parents finally saw their children. They sang the song of Chairman Mao's quotations, "Strive for Victory," loudly through the iron bars, encouraging their children to continue the struggle. The children on the other side shouted loudly, telling their parents not to worry and expressing their determination to fight the enemy to the end and be good students of Chairman Mao.

The British fascist authorities plotted to persecute these patriotic teachers and students, shamelessly fabricating the absurd charge of "participating in a threatening assembly" and conducting illegal interrogations. In the "court," the teachers and students firmly protested against the enemy's atrocities. They denounced the enemy:

	"Singing the song of Chairman Mao's quotations and shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao' is incitement?"
	"This fully proves that you are terrified of Mao Zedong Thought!"
	"We will report you to the world!"

The enemy, at a loss, brought out a "witness" to fabricate testimony. However, under the stern refutation of the teachers and students, a "witness" from the British police turned pale with fright, calling out that he was dizzy and unable to speak.

An 18-year-old female student in the "court" swept her hateful gaze across the crowd of demons, angrily protesting against the British authorities' illegal arrest of students. The teachers, students, and parents present also expressed their great anger, all pointing at the "judge" and shouting, "You imperialists, bullying and tyrannizing, are even worse than beasts!" The "judge" turned pale with fear, unable to respond, and could only angrily announce the adjournment of the court.

In more than two months of illegal trials, the teachers and students of Xiangdao Middle School and the students' parents exposed the enemy mercilessly and fought resolutely against them. The British fascist authorities, at a loss, finally secretly "sentenced" the students individually, unreasonably "sentencing" the teachers and students to one to two years of imprisonment, caning, or "bail." When the enemy "sentenced" them, the students shouted passionately, "Down with British imperialism!" "Protest against the illegal sentence!" "Patriotism is not a crime!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The slogans shook the enemy's fascist "court," declaring the complete failure of the British authorities' political conspiracy. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    反英抗暴斗争中的一个英雄集体
    去年十一月一日下午五时许，香岛中学师生象往常一样放学回家。当一些学生行经九龙塘沙福道时，港英两名警察拦路挑衅，对学生进行搜查，并故意拖长时间，让更多路过的学生汇集到这一地点，蓄谋对他们进行集体绑架。
    港英布下圈套之后，即迅速开来大批“防暴队”。这些“防暴队”一到，就象豺狼一样蜂拥而上，用警棍、枪托、皮靴狠毒地踢打学生。学生们在张牙舞爪的野兽面前，没有表示丝毫的怯懦，他们昂首挺立，愤怒高呼：“抗议港英法西斯暴行！”“不准打人！”大家手挽手地同敌人进行坚决斗争。这时，许多随后到来的同学也奋不顾身地冲向现场，支援自己的同学。正要回家的女教师胡婉善也闻讯赶来，和同学们一起进行抗暴斗争。
    敌人发疯了！一位女学生被一个特务拉出队伍，一群暴徒用枪托撞击她的头部，并要强行拖她上警车。这位女学生在同学的支援下，奋力挣脱敌人的魔爪，跑回同学身边。这时，灭绝人性的港英暴徒竟疯狂地向她开枪射击。
    在敌人的枪声中，师生们高声朗读毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们挺起胸膛对着敌人的枪口，激昂地高呼：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是不怕死的！”
  “毛主席万岁！”他们抓住迎面打来的警棍，一次又一次地英勇冲向敌人，抢救被拖走的同学。
    天色黑下来。当敌人把五十二名学生和胡婉善老师强行绑架上警车时，师生们齐声朗读毛主席语录，高呼“毛主席万岁！”高唱毛主席语录歌。激昂雄壮的口号声和革命歌声划破夜空，压下了港英法西斯暴徒的嚎叫。
    港英法西斯的暴行激起了其他师生和家长的无比愤怒。约有七八十名学生家长立即结队前往九龙城警署，怒斥港英暴徒的强盗行径，喝令立即释放所有被捕的师生。港英警察持枪指向家长，要他们立即散去。家长们大声喝道：“你们有胆就开枪！”家长们威武的气概，迫使港英法西斯暴徒垂下了枪口。
    经过三个小时的斗争，家长们终于见到自己的子弟，他们隔着铁栏杆高声齐唱毛主席语录歌《争取胜利》，鼓励子弟们坚持斗争。孩子们也在那一边高声呼喊，要家长们放心，表示决心要同敌人斗争到底，做毛主席的好学生。
    港英法西斯当局蓄谋迫害这批爱国师生，无耻地捏造了所谓
  “参加恐吓性集会”的荒谬“罪名”，对他们进行非法审讯。在“法庭”上，师生们坚决抗议敌人的暴行，他们痛斥敌人：
      “唱毛主席语录歌，喊毛主席万岁，是煽动吗？”
      “这完全证明你们对毛泽东思想怕得要死！”
      “我们要向全世界控诉你们！”
    敌人无可奈何，又拉出“证人”来，编造证词。但在师生们的严正驳斥下，港英警方的一名“证人”，竟吓得面青唇白，连叫头晕，连话也说不出。
    一位十八岁的女学生在“法庭”上以仇恨的目光横扫群魔，愤怒抗议港英当局非法逮捕学生的罪行。师生和旁听家长也以极大愤怒，一齐指着“法官”喝道：“你们这些帝国主义者，横行霸道，简直连野兽也不如！”“法官”吓得面如土色，无言答对，只好气急败坏地宣布退庭。
    在连续两个多月的非法审讯中，香岛中学的师生和学生的家长们对敌人进行了无情的揭露和坚决的斗争。港英法西斯当局无计可施，最后，竟鬼鬼祟祟地对学生进行单独“宣判”，无理地分别“判处”师生们以一年至两年的监禁、笞刑或“签保”。学生们在敌人“宣判”时，激昂地高呼：“打倒英帝！”“抗议非法判决！”
  “爱国无罪！”“毛主席万岁！”口号声震撼了敌人的法西斯“法庭”，宣告了港英当局政治阴谋的彻底破产。　（据新华社讯）
