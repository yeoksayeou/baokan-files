In the march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group of Henan Province and the Party Committee of the Henan Military Region have decided: just as guns are issued to soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, a copy of the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" will be distributed to every poor and lower-middle peasant household in the province. This is to further promote the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in rural areas, enabling the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new and great victories.

Currently, more than eight million copies of the red treasure are being distributed across the province's rural areas. This is a momentous event in the political life of the province's poor and lower-middle peasants.

"Chairman Mao's book, we poor and lower-middle peasants love to read the most." In recent days, tens of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants across Henan's vast rural areas have enthusiastically welcomed the widespread distribution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure. Wherever the colorful cars loaded with red treasures go, they bring about moving scenes. Members of rural people's communes, young and old, sing and dance, beat drums and gongs, and hold grand ceremonies to receive the books. They enthusiastically shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and declare their resolve to engrave Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, infuse it into their blood, and implement it in their actions, turning Henan's rural areas into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The people of Henan have deeply felt from their revolutionary struggles that reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is victory. The path indicated by Chairman Mao is always the path to victory.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang County, one of the earliest established people's communes in the country, reviewed their journey from victory to victory under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought after receiving the revolutionary treasure. Ten years ago, when Xiliying People's Commune was just born, our great leader Chairman Mao personally came to inspect Xiliying. Chairman Mao's inspection was the greatest encouragement and support for the members of Xiliying People's Commune. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiliying Commune have steadfastly followed Chairman Mao's instructions and advanced towards victory. In the fierce and complex class struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiliying repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, clarified the direction, and repelled the capitalist restoration wind stirred up by China's Khrushchev; in the face of severe natural disasters, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiliying drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's works to fight against heaven and earth, making the collective economy develop continuously. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiliying Commune love Chairman Mao even more. Reading Chairman Mao's books has become their first political need. After receiving the red revolutionary treasure, old poor peasant Lyu Shumu said excitedly: "Heaven is big, earth is big, but Chairman Mao's grace is the biggest. Father is dear, mother is dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer. Respected Chairman Mao, following you is victory. The path you indicate, we will follow it. We poor and lower-middle peasants will be loyal to you for generations!"

Song Xueyi, one of the five heroes of Wolf Mountain, was particularly moved after receiving the treasure. He said, we defeated Japanese imperialism relying on Mao Zedong Thought; we defeated the Kuomintang's eight hundred thousand troops relying on Mao Zedong Thought; we will achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our revolutionary people's heirloom, and it must be passed down from generation to generation!

On the day the Li DeFu family of Xishentai Brigade, Wangtai Commune, Xin County, received the treasure, the whole family celebrated as if it were a festival. The house was cleaned inside and out, and a new portrait of Chairman Mao was hung inside. The three generations of the Li DeFu family faced the red sun in their hearts and wished our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! From the day they received the treasure, this old poor peasant family of three generations sat together under an oil lamp every night, read Chairman Mao's books together, discussed national affairs, fought against selfishness, and fiercely criticized revisionism.

Many poor and lower-middle peasant families held family meetings when they received the treasure, discussed, and formulated plans for the whole family to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They said: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We want our descendants to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in making revolution! (with pictures)

    进一步推动农村活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动
    河南发给每户贫下中农一本《毛主席语录》
    据新华社郑州二十六日电　在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军中，河南省革命委员会筹备小组、河南省军区党委决定：象给解放军战士发枪一样，发给全省每户贫下中农一本革命宝书《毛主席语录》，以进一步推动农村活学活用毛泽东思想伟大群众运动更加广泛和深入地开展，使广大贫下中农紧紧掌握毛泽东思想去夺取新的伟大的胜利。
    目前，八百多万册红色宝书正在全省农村陆续发行。这是全省贫下中农政治生活中一件振奋人心的大喜事。
      “毛主席的书，俺贫下中农最爱读。”连日来，河南广大农村数千万贫下中农热烈欢呼毛主席的革命宝书在农村广泛发行。满载红色宝书的彩车开到那里，那里就出现激动人心的情景。农村人民公社社员扶老携幼，载歌载舞，敲锣打鼓，隆重举行授书仪式。他们纵情欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”并表示决心把毛泽东思想刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，把河南农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。河南人民从自己革命斗争实践中，深切地体会到：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就是胜利，毛主席指引的道路永远是胜利的道路。
    全国最早成立起来的人民公社之一——新乡县七里营人民公社的贫下中农得到革命宝书后，满怀革命豪情地回顾了他们在毛泽东思想指引下，从胜利走向胜利的战斗历程。十年前，七里营人民公社刚刚诞生的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自来到七里营视察。毛主席的视察，是对七里营人民公社社员的最大鼓舞、最大支持。七里营公社广大贫下中农坚定不移地遵循毛主席的指示，胜利前进。在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，七里营贫下中农一遍又一遍学习毛主席著作，辨明了方向，打退了中国赫鲁晓夫煽起的复辟资本主义的单干风；在严重的自然灾害面前，七里营广大贫下中农又从毛主席著作中汲取了战天斗地的无穷力量，使集体经济不断发展。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，七里营公社贫下中农热爱毛主席的心更红，读毛主席的书，已成为他们政治生活的第一需要。得到红彤彤的革命宝书后，老贫农吕树墨激动地说：“天大地大不如毛主席恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。敬爱的毛主席啊，跟着您，就是胜利，您老人家指引的道路我们走定了，我们贫下中农千秋万代永远忠于您。”
    狼牙山五壮士之一——宋学义，在得到宝书后，心情特别激动。他说，我们打败日本帝国主义，靠的是毛泽东思想；我们打败蒋匪帮八百万军队，靠的是毛泽东思想；我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，靠的还是毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们革命人民的传家宝，要世世代代地传下去！
    沁阳县王台公社西申台大队老贫农李德富一家，迎宝书的那天，全家象过节日一样，屋里屋外打扫得干干净净，屋里挂上新的毛主席像。李德富一家三代面向心中的红太阳，敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！从领到宝书那一天起，这户老贫农祖孙三代，每天晚上都围坐在一盏油灯下，一同读毛主席的书，讨论国家大事，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义。
    许多贫下中农家庭得到宝书时，还开了家庭会，讨论、制定了全家活学活用毛主席著作的计划。他们说：毛泽东思想是俺贫下中农的命根子。俺要子孙万代读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，永远紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命！（附图片）
