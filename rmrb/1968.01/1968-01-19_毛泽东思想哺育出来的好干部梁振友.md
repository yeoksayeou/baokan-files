“Spring breeze and willows swaying, six hundred million people all become sages.”
In this great historical moment of welcoming the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the Fourth Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, people, with their strong class sentiments of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the great Mao Zedong Thought, are praising a shining name—Liang Zhenyou.

Comrade Liang Zhenyou, who died a martyr, was the director of the office of a research institute under a bureau of the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army. In July 1966, he was engaged in the "four cleanups" in Yongxing Production Brigade, Luanan County, Shaanxi Province. At that time, the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, were burning across the country. To save the life of a young man who was delivering the notice of the deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the flood, he sacrificed his life heroically.

Comrade Liang Zhenyou had been in the army for twenty years, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, dedicating himself entirely to the people. He sacrificed his life for the interests of the Party and the people. Comrade Liang Zhenyou was an outstanding proletarian revolutionary fighter, a good cadre nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. His brilliant deeds added new glory to the great People's Liberation Army, set a shining example for hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, and for countless revolutionary cadres!

“Born for the people, die for the people”

On July 29, 1966, it was a day that the people of Luanan County, Shaanxi Province, would never forget.

On that day, after a heavy rain, the Shitouya River in the county surged with muddy water and rolling stones.

At 10:45 AM, the "four cleanups" work team in Yongxing Brigade had a notice about the deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that urgently needed to be delivered to the production brigade across the Shitouya River. The rural youth Yin Hongshan took the notice and rushed towards the roaring Shitouya River.

Comrade Liang Zhenyou, who was serving as the director of the "four cleanups" work team in this brigade, was thinking about how to carry out the Cultural Revolution in the countryside and was very concerned about the notice. Seeing Hongshan's fleeing figure, he felt uneasy: the water was so high, and Hongshan alone might be in danger!

“To care for the Party and the masses more than for oneself, to care for others more than for oneself. Only then can one be called a Communist Party member.” Chairman Mao's great teachings suddenly flashed in Comrade Liang Zhenyou's mind. Without hesitation, he immediately rushed to the Shitouya River and, in the current, supported Hongshan, advancing chest-first!

Just as they reached the middle of the river, a sudden wave hit them, and both fell down. Liang Zhenyou exerted all his strength to help Hongshan up. Before they could take a few steps, another giant wave rolled in, and both were exhausted, swept away by the flood.

The wind howled, and the waves struck their bodies. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's great teachings: “This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight on.” gave Liang Zhenyou boundless strength. He made up his mind: even if he had to sacrifice himself, he must save Hongshan and deliver the notice to the other side.

Comrade Liang Zhenyou had been in the countryside for over four months, participating in the "four cleanups" movement in response to Chairman Mao's call. He was familiar with every stone in the Shitouya River. He knew that in such a big flood, to cross the Shitouya River quickly, one must rush through the shallow and rapid current and then swim into the deeper and calmer pool, avoiding the impact of the rapid current and stones, making it easier to land.

The first pool arrived. “Be determined, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.” Liang Zhenyou kicked Hongshan hard, trying to kick him towards the pool to avoid the rapid current, but because the water was too strong, he did not kick far. Seeing Hongshan about to be swept away by the flood, at this critical moment, Liang Zhenyou gritted his teeth and swam towards Hongshan, pushing him hard with his hand to help him break through the rapid current. He swam into the pool, allowing him to climb onto the shore using the cliff by the pool. At this moment, a giant wave hit, and Liang Zhenyou was swept away by the rapid current.

The second pool arrived. This was Liang Zhenyou's last chance to reach the shore. Liang Zhenyou was already seriously injured and was using his last bit of strength to swim towards the shore. “Uncle Liang!” a voice suddenly called from the shore. It turned out to be Bai Wulu, the only son of the old poor peasant Bai Mingfa, crying and shouting to jump into the water to save him. Liang Zhenyou, with strong class feelings, disregarding his own safety, struggled to shout, “Wulu, don't come down, it's dangerous!” Just as Liang Zhenyou finished his last words, another giant wave hit, and his head struck a sharp rock, causing him to lose consciousness and be swept away by the rapid current, leaving his last chance to reach the shore.

“Save people! Save people! Uncle Liang has been swept away by the water!” Bai Wulu's piercing cry alerted the villagers on both sides of the river. They rushed to the riverbank and chased downstream. After a long chase, people finally found their comrade in the rapid current. The villagers linked arms and formed an unbreakable human barrier, finally pulling Old Liang out of the water. However, he had sustained fourteen injuries, and his heart had stopped beating. People hugged Old Liang's head, calling his name, and could not believe that such a good comrade had died.

People returned to the village, holding the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* that Liang Zhenyou had placed on the table with reverence. The four red volumes shone with a thousand rays of light! Beside the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, there were several articles, speeches, and letters he had written by hand about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The voice of martyr Liang Zhenyou will forever echo in the hearts of the revolutionary people: “Firmly stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” “Defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!”

Among Liang Zhenyou's belongings, people found more than ten notebooks of diaries he had written from 1948 to 1966, recording his life of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to the people, and to the Party. Soon after joining the revolution, he wrote such bold words: “Born for the people, die for the people.” Now, Comrade Liang Zhenyou has practiced the oath of a proletarian revolutionary fighter with his blood and life.

“Following Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life is my greatest happiness”

Comrade Liang Zhenyou joined the Communist Party of China in April 1946 and the People's Liberation Army in September of the same year. His life was one of boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the great Mao Zedong Thought, a life of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Liang Zhenyou was born in a poor peasant family in Yushan Village, Yushan Commune, Haiyang County, Shandong Province. His ancestors had been hired laborers for three generations. His grandfather had carried loads for more than twenty years and was killed by the ruthless exploitation of the class enemy. His grandmother, leaning on a cane, begged for food and starved to death. His father started herding cattle for the landlord at the age of eight and was a slave all his life. His elder and second brothers also worked as hired laborers for more than ten years, suffering endless humiliation from the class enemy. The ruthless class exploitation and oppression made him hate the old society deeply and love, believe in, admire, and be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao.

During the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, Liang Zhenyou, who had just learned to read, copied Chairman Mao's brilliant work *On Protracted War* word by word under the dim light of an oil lamp. At the age of thirteen, he was elected as the leader of the children's team in his village and, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, fought to the death with the enemy. Later, he entered Haiyang Normal School and copied Chairman Mao's great works *The Orientation of the Youth Movement*, *Rectify the Party's Style of Work*, *Reform Our Study_, and *Oppose Party Eight Stocks_, among others, night after night, and circulated them among his classmates to inspire revolutionary spirit, becoming an outstanding revolutionary youngster. He once discussed with his classmates to organize a group of young people to walk to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an to see the great leader Chairman Mao.

After joining the army, under the Party's guidance, Liang Zhenyou's class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao grew stronger day by day. Whether on the rugged and muddy march or on the battlefield filled with gunfire, Liang Zhenyou's heart was always filled with a red sun—the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, inspiring him to fight to the death, to march north and south, and to work hard for the Party and the people.

Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and established New China. Comrade Liang Zhenyou, with strong class feelings, sang with great excitement that Chairman Mao was “the sun of the people, the great man of the people, the savior of the people.” He wrote in his diary: “The red flag is the blood of the soldiers, and the glorious era is created by Chairman Mao.” “I love the land of my motherland, I love the working people of my motherland, and I love the great leader of the working people of my motherland, Chairman Mao.” On October 1, 1955, Comrade Liang Zhenyou saw Chairman Mao for the first time at Tiananmen Square in the capital. He stood on his tiptoes and looked again and again, never getting enough. His heart was filled with indescribable joy, shouting “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!” and swearing “I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao! Following Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life is my greatest happiness!”

In the revolutionary ranks, Comrade Liang Zhenyou, with his revolutionary passion of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, gradually transforming from a young person with a simple class consciousness into a self-aware proletarian revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought. At every important historical juncture, he firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and fought mercilessly against all anti-Mao Zedong Thought words and deeds. When Vice Chairman Lin, a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, called on the entire army to strive to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, he persisted in reading Chairman Mao's books, firmly believed in Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions without wavering.

After becoming the director of the office, Comrade Liang Zhenyou repeatedly warned himself: “Without studying Chairman Mao's works, one cannot revolutionize and does not have the qualifications to be a leader.” “Any leader's authority over subordinates can only be the authority of Mao Zedong Thought.” He only required subordinates to follow his leadership in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and encouraged everyone to fight against his words and deeds that deviated from Mao Zedong Thought. Similarly, for his superiors, if something went against Mao Zedong Thought, he would resist and raise objections. He said: “We act according to Mao Zedong Thought, taking responsibility for the Party and the people. If a leader does not act according to Mao Zedong Thought, I will resist and oppose. Since the day I joined the Party, I have dedicated my life to the people and fear nothing!”

During the time when the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing crazily promoted the bourgeois military line, opposing Mao Zedong Thought and opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics, Comrade Liang Zhenyou firmly defended the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. He led his comrades to study Chairman Mao's theories on political construction of the army and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing politics repeatedly and fought against various phenomena that undermined politics. Someone used work to crowd out study and used business to undermine politics. Comrade Liang Zhenyou criticized, saying: “How to solve the contradiction between work and study? When a contradiction arises, who gives way to whom? One must adhere to one principle: put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work. This requires three things: firmness, struggle, and no wavering. First, firmness: in any situation, adhere to the study system; second, struggle: struggle against lazy thoughts and against people and things that interfere with your study; third, no wavering: be unyielding, not giving an inch, and unshakable.” He personally led his comrades to formulate a system for studying Chairman Mao's works.

In March 1966, Comrade Liang Zhenyou went to Luanan County, Shaanxi Province, to participate in the socialist education movement in the countryside. He firmly implemented the “Twenty-Three Articles” and the “Ten Articles” personally formulated by Chairman Mao, actively armed the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and fought resolutely against the rightist opportunist line of “left” in form and right in essence promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Comrade Liang Zhenyou insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought and the “Twenty-Three Articles” to arm and mobilize the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. After entering the village, the first thing he did was to hang a portrait of Chairman Mao in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the first gift he gave to the children was a handwritten note saying “Long live Chairman Mao.” He and the old poor peasant Wang Zhongyin went up the mountain to herd cattle together, carried baskets to collect manure together, and taught him the “Three Articles” word by word, making Wang Zhongyin a revolutionary cadre with a firm stand, clear hatred, selflessness, and daring to fight, who became the director of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of the brigade. Comrade Liang Zhenyou also visited the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants one by one, mobilizing the masses to fight resolutely against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making the “four cleanups” movement in Yongxing Brigade achieve great results according to the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The rightist opportunist line of “left” in form and right in essence promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev opposed Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, did not trust the broad revolutionary cadres in the countryside, and implemented the policy of “striking a large area and protecting a small number.” Comrade Liang Zhenyou firmly resisted this. He organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly treating cadres, helping the poor and lower-middle peasants to correctly treat cadres; at the same time, he strengthened the Mao Zedong Thought education of cadres, helping cadres to correctly treat themselves and the masses, letting the rural cadres stand the test in the storm of class struggle. Under his help, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants always directed their struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in society.

In June 1966, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched nationwide, Comrade Liang Zhenyou immediately wrote a pledge: “The People's Liberation Army is a tool of the proletarian dictatorship created by Comrade Mao Zedong, loyal to the Party and the people. As a member of the People's Liberation Army, I will firmly stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fight mercilessly against all anti-Party, anti-Chairman Mao, and anti-socialist elements, defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, and defending Mao Zedong Thought!” He organized cadres and villagers to study central documents and editorials, write big-character posters, and actively led the poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who were against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, he organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to compile artistic performances praising Chairman Mao and propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought.

“We are the sons of the people and should be the servants of the people”

Since the day Comrade Liang Zhenyou joined the children's team, he gradually understood the meaning of serving the people wholeheartedly under the cultivation and education of Mao Zedong Thought. Every day, he happily sang “The moon is crescent, the stars are twinkling, we are all in the children's team...” leading the children to the homes of the villagers to propagate the Party's policies, helping the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to carry water and firewood, assisting the militia to stand guard and catch bad guys, and participating in the village's rent reduction and anti-tyrant struggles. On August 1, 1944, Liang Zhenyou saw on his way home that an old man's cart was stuck in the river and was in danger of being submerged by the water. He fearlessly jumped into the water first and, with his comrades, pulled the cart onto the shore. The old man was so moved that he could only say after a long time, “Thank you so much for your help!” Liang Zhenyou, however, replied with deep emotion, “We are the sons of the people and should be the servants of the people. No matter what danger we encounter, we must help the masses solve their difficulties.” After joining the army, Comrade Liang Zhenyou always linked his fate with that of the working people, fighting bravely to liberate all the suffering people of China, and taking the oath to “live for the people and die for the people.” Whether during the War of Liberation or after the national liberation, Comrade Liang Zhenyou always remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: “Serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses for a moment.”

During the “four cleanups” movement in the countryside, Comrade Liang Zhenyou first regarded himself as a servant of the poor and lower-middle peasants and a student of the masses, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants diligently, loving what the poor and lower-middle peasants loved, hating what the poor and lower-middle peasants hated, thinking what the poor and lower-middle peasants thought, and helping the poor and lower-middle peasants with what they needed, becoming a close friend of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After entering the village, on the first page of his work notebook, Comrade Liang Zhenyou drew a map of the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Yongxing Brigade and visited the homes of the masses one by one, seeking their advice, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought to every home of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor peasant Lu Dama was the farthest from his residence. In just a few months, Comrade Liang Zhenyou visited her home four times, each time bringing warmth and strength to this old woman who had suffered deeply in the old society. The first time he went, he told Lu Dama about the “Twenty-Three Articles” personally formulated by Chairman Mao and the significance of the socialist education movement. He found that Lu Dama had a festering wound on her leg and cleaned it for her. Lu Dama, moved, asked him, “Old Liang, I am a beggar by birth, don't you mind me being dirty?” Comrade Liang Zhenyou replied, “My mother was also a beggar in the old society, and I have never minded her being dirty!” Lu Dama's tears flowed, and she was so excited that she couldn't say a word. Later, Comrade Liang Zhenyou also invited a doctor to treat Lu Dama. The second time he went, Lu Dama was collecting firewood on the slope, so he helped her collect and carry it back. After arriving home, he busily cooked for Lu Dama, letting the old woman rest. When the food was ready, Lu Dama insisted on pulling him to eat, but he declined, saying he had something to do, and hurriedly left. The third time he went, he and Lu Dama talked about their family history, and both cried. He took out his handkerchief and wiped Lu Dama's tears, reading Chairman Mao's works to her. This time he found that Lu Dama's house was leaking, and after returning, he told his work team comrades, “The poor and lower-middle peasants are closer to us than our parents. Let our relatives live in a leaking house, how would we feel?” Immediately, he organized everyone to cut grass, and a few days later, he and a few comrades braved the rain and ran more than five miles to Lu Dama's house for the fourth time, repairing her leaking house. When they returned, covered in mud and water, he happily wrote in his diary, “Tired? Tired. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I feel full of energy. This is my duty and responsibility.”

Comrade Liang Zhenyou insisted on eating, living, working, and studying with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor peasant Chen Tianchun knew he had a stomach problem and tried his best to steam white steamed buns for him, fearing he wouldn't eat them, and hid the white steamed buns on top of the steamer, hiding his own black steamed buns underneath. Comrade Liang Zhenyou went to eat and refused to eat the white steamed buns, repeatedly explaining to Chen Tianchun that cadres are servants of the people and should share weal and woe with the masses. Saying this, he took out the black steamed buns from under the steamer and ate them. Some comrades in the work team ate at the homes of the masses and sometimes dropped some rice and vegetable leaves. He found them and immediately picked them up and put them in his mouth. He said, “We are servants of the people, and we only have the duty to serve the people and no right to waste a drop of the people's blood and sweat!”

Comrade Liang Zhenyou was not in good health, but he worked with boundless energy. He often worked until one or two in the morning and got up with the villagers to work in the fields at dawn. The poor and lower-middle peasants advised him to rest well, but he said, “Working for the Party and the people, twenty-four hours a day is not enough for me.” On the day before his martyrdom—July 28, in the morning, Comrade Liang Zhenyou studied with everyone the heroic deeds of the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Liu Yingjun, helped three brigades of poor and lower-middle peasants rehearse more than fifty programs they created to praise the Party and Chairman Mao, arranged the militia work, drafted a ten-day work plan for the brigade, and arranged the work for the next day... He worked intensively until 4 AM on July 29 before resting. When the sky brightened, he got up on time to insist on “daily reading.” No one expected that an hour later, the news of his heroic martyrdom would be announced. Comrade Liang Zhenyou truly practiced Chairman Mao's teachings of “being the ‘ox’ of the proletariat and the people, working tirelessly, and dying only then.”

“Learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is my lifelong battle task”

“Learn the ‘Three Articles’ for life and reform one's worldview for life”

During the twenty years of Comrade Liang Zhenyou's revolutionary career after joining the Party and the army, he never forgot to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to reform his worldview. He wrote in his diary: “Learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is my lifelong battle task.” “I will learn the ‘Three Articles’ for life and reform my worldview for life.” Comrade Liang Zhenyou, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and to the people, practiced his oath with his practical actions. Every step he took shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the spring of 1949, just before the national liberation, Comrade Liang Zhenyou followed the army southward, entering a big city from the countryside. He immediately copied a passage from Chairman Mao's *Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China*: “There may be some Communists who have not been conquered by the enemy with guns but who cannot withstand the sugar-coated bullets. We must prevent this situation.” He often used this passage to examine his every word and deed, determined to maintain the excellent political qualities of a Communist for life.

For seventeen years, from the battlefield filled with gunpowder to the bustling city, from the supply system to the salary system, the living environment and material conditions changed, but Liang Zhenyou always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, and his thrifty and simple style never changed. He strictly prevented bourgeois ideology from infiltrating through the living domain. During every political movement, he firmly stood on the Party's side and fought resolutely against all class enemies and bourgeois ideology.

When the Chinese Khrushchev tried to make the black *Cultivation of the Self* a Party course textbook, Comrade Liang Zhenyou firmly resisted it in his thoughts. He threw the black *Cultivation of the Self* aside and seriously studied the “Three Articles,” using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to resist the “theory of the fusion of public and private interests” and the “philosophy of survival” advocated in *Cultivation of the Self*. As early as 1951, Comrade Liang Zhenyou wrote in his diary: “Anyone who considers all problems from the perspective of ‘me’ is the most dangerous person. Such a person will surrender to the enemy in prison, betray the Party and the people's cause, and become a disgraceful deserter on the battlefield. His life will become worthless, worse than dog shit, and will be forever spit on by the people. For all problems, he considers not ‘me’ but the interests of the Party and the people, and he will become strong. Even if his life is taken by the devil, his spirit will not die!”

Anyone who had worked or lived with Comrade Liang Zhenyou admired his extremely strict spirit in reforming his worldview. He learned from Chairman Mao's teachings, applied them, persisted, and was meticulous. With the increase of age and responsibility, his requirements for his own ideological reform became higher and higher.

In the long process of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and reforming his worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Liang Zhenyou summarized four experiences: “First, fearlessness: do not fear exposing one's thoughts, do not fear losing face, and do not fear criticism; second, admission: admit contradictions, admit struggle, and admit one's shortcomings and backwardness; third, struggle: struggle against one's non-proletarian thoughts, both by oneself and by mobilizing others; fourth, summary: timely summarize experiences and lessons, correct what does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and promote what conforms to Mao Zedong Thought.”

Comrade Liang Zhenyou always did this. During the “four cleanups” movement, once the leadership forwarded a letter criticizing the work team leaders, Comrade Liang Zhenyou immediately checked his shortcomings, personally organized the entire work team to discuss seriously, and quickly corrected them. Later, he copied the letter into his diary, carried it with him, and often looked at it to spur himself on.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Liang Zhenyou even more diligently learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, consciously breaking private interests and establishing public interests. In a diary entry titled *Learning “In Memory of Norman Bethune” Three Times After Entering the Village*, written twenty days before his martyrdom, he expressed his determination to constantly revolutionize in the depths of his soul and thoroughly reform his worldview:

“Establish a revolutionary worldview,
To ‘completely’ and ‘thoroughly’ serve the people.
Often struggle with the ‘me’ character,
Be strict with oneself and never forget,
Consider dying for the people as one's destiny.”

“For the sake of great ideals, dare to change the heavens and earth.”

After Comrade Liang Zhenyou's martyrdom, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep respect, buried him by the Shitouya River. They said, “Old Liang sacrificed himself for us. When he was alive, he helped us learn Chairman Mao's works every day and educated us to walk the socialist path. After his death, we will bury him in Yongxing, let him see Yongxing become a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and see us march towards communism!” To commemorate this outstanding proletarian revolutionary fighter, the villagers renamed the Shitouya River as the Martyrs' River and built a memorial monument with bricks and stones by the river. The good son of the people—Comrade Liang Zhenyou will forever live in the hearts of the people!

In the brilliant year of 1968, the unit where martyr Liang Zhenyou served and Yongxing Brigade further launched a wave of learning his heroic deeds. The broad cadres, soldiers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres decided to take Comrade Liang Zhenyou as an example, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛泽东思想哺育出来的好干部梁振友
    “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大历史时刻，在中国人民解放军总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会上，人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限忠诚的强烈阶级感情，传颂着一个光辉的名字——梁振友。
    梁振友烈士生前是中国人民解放军总参谋部某局研究所办公室主任。一九六六年七月，他在陕西省洛南县永星大队搞“四清”。这时候，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火在全国各地点燃了。他为了在洪水中抢救一名传送无产阶级文化大革命部署通知的青年的生命，壮烈地牺牲了。
    梁振友同志参军二十年来，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，一心为人民，一切为人民。他为了党和人民的利益，献出了自己的一生。梁振友同志是优秀的无产阶级革命战士，是毛泽东思想哺育出来的好干部。他的光辉事迹，为伟大的中国人民解放军增添了新的光荣，为全国亿万军民，为千千万万革命干部树立了光辉的榜样！
      “生为人民而生，死为人民而死”
    一九六六年七月二十九日，是陕西洛南县人民永远忘记不了的一天。
    这一天，暴雨过后，石头峪河山洪暴发。汹涌的河水卷着砂石，飞泻而下。
    上午十时四十五分，永星大队“四清”工作组有一份关于无产阶级文化大革命部署的通知，急需送到石头峪河对岸的生产队。农村青年殷宏山拿上通知，拔腿就走，朝着咆哮的石头峪河奔去。
    在这个大队担任“四清”工作组指导员的梁振友同志，正考虑着农村如何开展文化大革命的问题，十分关心那份通知，他看到宏山飞跑的身影，心里很不安：洪水这样大，宏山一个人过河，很可能出危险啊！
    “关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”毛主席的伟大教导，顿时闪现在梁振友同志的脑海里。他毫不迟疑，立即奔向石头峪河，在激流中扶着宏山，挺胸前进！
      刚到河心，一个急浪打来，两个人同时倒了下去。梁振友用尽平生力气扶起宏山。不到几步，又是一个巨浪卷来，两个人已经筋疲力尽，被洪水冲走了。
    狂风震耳，巨浪击身。在这生死关头，毛主席的伟大教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”使梁振友浑身充满了力量。他下定决心：就是牺牲自己，也要把宏山救上来，把通知送到对岸去。
    梁振友同志响应毛主席的伟大号召，来这里参加
  “四清”运动，已经四个多月了。他熟悉石头峪河的一沙一石。他知道，在这样大的洪水中抢渡石头峪河，必须迅速穿过浅滩急流，然后游进水势较缓的深潭，才能避免急流乱石的冲击，比较容易上岸。在这段河流中，这样的深潭有两个。
    第一个深潭到了。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”梁振友用力向宏山蹬了一脚，想把他蹬向深潭，避开急流，但因水急阻力大，没有蹬出多远，眼看宏山就要被洪水冲走，在这千钧一发的时刻，梁振友咬紧牙关，游向宏山，用手猛力一推，帮助宏山闯出急流。游入深潭，使他攀着潭畔的崖石，安全登上河岸。就在这时，一个巨浪打来，梁振友同志却被急流冲走了。
    第二个深潭到了。这是梁振友同志争取上岸的最后一个机会。梁振友同志这时已经身负重伤，正在使尽最后一点力气往岸边游。“梁叔叔！”岸上突然传来一声呼唤。原来是老贫农白明发唯一的儿子白五禄，哭着喊着要跳下水来救他。梁振友同志怀着强烈的阶级感情，不顾个人安危，艰难地断断续续地喊道：“五禄，不要下来，危险！”就在梁振友同志说完最后一句话的刹那间，又一个巨浪打来，他的头部撞在一块锋利的巨石上，当即昏迷过去，随着急流，离开了最后一个争取上岸的地方。
      “救人哪，救人哪！梁叔叔被水冲走了！”白五禄的尖叫声，惊动了河两岸的社员。他们奔向河边，顺水直追。追出好远，人们才在激流中找到亲人。社员们手挽着手，臂连着臂，筑成一道冲不垮的人堤，终于把老梁捞了上来。可是他已经身负十四处伤，心脏停止了跳动。人们抱着老梁的头，呼唤着他的名字，怎么也不相信这样好的同志会死去。
    人们回到村里，怀着崇敬的心情，轻轻捧起梁振友生前放在桌上的《毛泽东选集》。四卷红书放射出万道金光！在《毛泽东选集》旁边，放着他亲笔写下的几篇关于无产阶级文化大革命的文章、讲话稿和书信。梁振友烈士的声音，永远响彻在革命人民的心中：“坚决站在无产阶级文化大革命的前列。”“保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，捍卫无产阶级政权！”
    在梁振友同志的遗物中，人们发现了他从一九四八年到一九六六年间写的十几本日记，记录了他无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于人民，无限忠于党的光辉一生。他在参加革命不久就写下了这样的豪言壮语：“生为人民而生，死为人民而死”。现在，梁振友同志用自己的鲜血和生命实践了一个无产阶级革命战士的战斗誓言。
        “跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，是我最大的幸福”
    梁振友同志一九四六年四月加入中国共产党，同年九月参加人民解放军。他的一生，是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想的一生，是活学活用毛主席著作，勇敢捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一生。
    梁振友同志出生在山东省海阳县于山公社于山夼村一个贫农的家庭里，祖辈三代都是长工。爷爷扛了二十几年的活，被阶级敌人的残酷剥削夺去了生命。奶奶拄着拐杖四处讨饭，活活地饿死。爸爸从八岁起就给地主放牛，当了一辈子牛马。大哥、二哥也都干了十几年的长工，受尽了阶级敌人的欺凌。残酷的阶级剥  削和阶级压迫，使他对旧社会无比憎恨，对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
      在抗日战争的艰苦岁月里，刚刚识字的梁振友就在煤油灯下一字一句地抄写毛主席的光辉著作《论持久战》。十三岁时，他被选为本村儿童团团长，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，和敌人进行殊死的斗争。后来，他进入海阳师范学校，又夜以继日地抄写毛主席的《青年运动的方向》、《整顿党的作风》、《改造我们的学习》、《反对党八股》等伟大著作，在同学中传阅，鼓舞革命斗志，成为一名十分出色的革命小将。他曾经和同学商量，要组织一批青年步行前往革命圣地延安，去见伟大领袖毛主席。
      梁振友参军以后，在党的教导下，对伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情与日俱增。不论在崎岖泥泞的行军路上，还是在炮火纷飞的战场上，梁振友同志的心中时刻都有一轮红太阳——我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，鼓舞着他出生入死，南征北战，为党为人民辛勤工作。
      中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，摧毁了蒋家王朝的反动统治，建立了新中国以后，梁振友同志怀着强烈的阶级感情，无比激动地歌颂毛主席是“人民的太阳，人民的伟人，人民的救星。”他在日记上写道：“鲜红的旗帜是战士的鲜血，光辉的时代是毛主席的创造。”“我爱祖国的大地，我爱祖国的劳动人民，我更爱祖国劳动人民的伟大领袖毛主席。”一九五五年十月一日，梁振友同志在首都天安门前，第一次亲眼见到了毛主席。他踮起双脚看了又看，怎么也看不够。他心里有说不出的高兴，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”千遍万遍地宣誓：“我要永远永远忠于毛主席！跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，是我最大的幸福！”
    梁振友同志在革命队伍里，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的革命激情，刻苦学习毛主席著作，逐渐由一个具有朴素的阶级觉悟的青年，锻炼成长为毛泽东思想武装起来的自觉的无产阶级革命战士。在每个重要的历史关头，他都坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和一切反毛泽东思想的言行作无情的斗争。毛主席的亲密战友林副主席号召全军努力活学活用毛主席著作，他更是坚持不懈地读毛主席的书，坚信不疑地听毛主席的话，坚定不移地按照毛主席的指示办事。
    梁振友同志担任办公室主任以后，不止一次地警告自己：“不学习毛主席著作，就不能革命，就没有资格当领导。”“任何一个领导者，对下级的领导权只能是毛泽东思想的领导权。”他只要求下级服从他符合毛泽东思想的领导，鼓励大家同他离开毛泽东思想的言行作斗争。同样，对自己的上级，如果那件事违背了毛泽东思想，他就抵制，就提意见。他说：“我们是按毛泽东思想办事，为党为人民负责，不按毛泽东思想办事的领导我就要抵制，就要顶。我在入党的那天起就把生命都交给人民了，什么也不怕！”
    在反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿疯狂地推行资产阶级军事路线，反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治的时候，梁振友同志坚定地捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他领导同志们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席关于政治建军的理论和林副主席关于突出政治的指示，同形形色色冲击政治的现象进行斗争。有人以工作挤掉学习，用业务冲击政治，梁振友同志批评说：“如何解决工作、学习的矛盾呢？在发生矛盾时，谁给谁让路呢？必须遵循一条原则，把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。这就要一坚、二斗、三不摇。一坚，在任何情况下坚持学习制度；二斗，要与懒汉思想斗争，与干扰你学习的人和事斗争；三不摇，就是要做到毫不含糊，寸步不让，雷打不散”，他亲自领导同志们制定了学习毛主席著作的制度。
    一九六六年三月，梁振友同志到陕西省洛南县参加农村社会主义教育运动。他坚定地执行毛主席亲自制定的“二十三条”和“前十条”，积极地用毛泽东思想武装广大贫下中农和农村干部，同中国赫鲁晓夫推行的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。梁振友同志坚持用毛泽东思想，用“二十三条”来武装和发动广大贫下中农。他进村以后办的第一件事，是给贫下中农家里挂上毛主席像，送给孩子们的第一件礼物，是亲笔写的“毛主席万岁”的字条。他和老贫农王忠银一同上山放牛，一同担筐拾粪，一字一句地反复教他学习“老三篇”，使王忠银成为立场坚定，爱憎分明，大公无私，勇于斗争的革命骨干，担任了大队贫协主任。梁振友同志还一家一户地去访问贫下中农，发动群众同党内一小撮走资派展开最坚决的斗争，使永星大队的“四清”运动按照毛主席指引的正确轨道，取得了巨大的成果。
      中国赫鲁晓夫推行的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，与毛主席的干部政策相对抗，不相信农村广大
  革命干部，实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。梁振友同志坚决予以抵制，他组织贫下中农学习毛主席关于正确对待干部的指示，帮助贫下中农正确对待干部；同
  时又加强对干部的毛泽东思想教育，帮助干部正确对待自己，正确对待群众，让农村干部在阶级斗争的大风雨中经受考验。广大贫下中农在他的帮助下，始终把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神。
      一九六六年六月间，无产阶级文化大革命在全国展开以后，梁振友同志立即写了决心书：“人民解放军是毛泽东同志亲手缔造的忠于党、忠于人民的无产阶级专政的工具。我是中国人民解放军的一员，坚决站在无产阶级文化大革命的前列，与一切反党、反毛主席、反社会主义分子作无情的斗争，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，捍卫毛泽东思想！”他组织干部、社员学习中央文件和报纸社论，写大字报，积极领导贫下中农向反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子猛烈开火。同时，组织贫下中农编写歌颂毛主席的文艺节目，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。
  “我们是人民的儿子，就要当人民的勤务员”
    梁振友同志从参加儿童团的那一天起，就在毛泽东思想的培养和教育下，逐渐懂得了全心全意为人民服务的道理。他每天高兴地唱着“月儿弯弯，星光闪闪，我们都是儿童团……”，领着儿童们到老乡家里宣传党的政策，帮助烈军属担水背柴，协助民兵站岗放哨捉坏人，参加村里减租和反霸斗争。一九四四年八月的一天，梁振友在回家的路上，看到一位老大爷赶的马车陷在河里，有被河水淹没的危险。他奋不顾身，第一个跳下水，和伙伴们一起把马车拉上了岸。老大爷感动得半天才说出一句话：“多亏你们帮了我的大忙啊！”梁振友却深情地回答：“我们是人民的儿子，就要当人民的勤务员，无论遇到什么危险，都要帮助群众解决困难。”参军后，梁振友同志一直把自己的命运同劳动人民的命运紧紧连结在一起，为解放全中国劳苦大众而英勇战斗，立下了“生为人民而生，死为人民而死”的战斗誓言。不论在解放战争时期，还在全国解放后，梁振友同志始终牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：
  “全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。
    梁振友同志在农村参加“四清”运动的时候，首先把自己看作是贫下中农的勤务员，看作是群众的小学生，勤勤恳恳地为贫下中农服务，爱贫下中农所爱，恨贫下中农所恨，想贫下中农所想，帮贫下中农所需，成为贫下中农的贴心人。
    梁振友同志进村以后，在工作手册的第一页上，就画上了永星大队贫下中农的住址图，挨家挨户地去访问群众，请教群众，把毛泽东思想传播到每一户贫下中农家里去。贫农社员鲁大妈是离他住地最远的一家，梁振友同志在短短的几个月里就到她家访问了四次，每一次都给这位在旧社会苦大仇深的老人带来了温暖和力量。第一次去，他就向鲁大妈讲了毛主席亲自制定的“二十三条”，讲了社会主义教育运动的意义。他发现鲁大妈腿上有个化了脓的伤口，就给她擦洗。鲁大妈感动地问他：“老梁，我是讨饭出身的，你不嫌我脏？”梁振友同志回答说：“我妈妈在旧社会也是讨饭的，我从没嫌我妈妈脏过！”鲁大妈热泪夺眶而出，激动得一句话也说不出来。事后，梁振友同志又请医生给鲁大妈治疗。第二次去，鲁大妈正在坡上打柴，他就帮她打好背了回来。到家后，他忙着替鲁大妈做饭，让老人家坐下休息。等饭做熟了，鲁大妈硬拉着他吃饭，他推说有事，急急忙忙地走了。第三次又去和鲁大妈拉家史，说得两人同时落泪，他掏出手帕，替鲁大妈擦干眼泪，给鲁大妈读毛主席著作。这次他发现鲁大妈房子漏雨，回去后对工作组的同志们说：“贫下中农比我们的父母还亲，让亲人住漏雨房，我们心里是啥滋味？”立即组织大家割草，过了几天又和几个同志一起冒雨跑了五里多路，第四次赶到鲁大妈家，把鲁大妈的房子修补好。回来时泥一身水一身，他却高兴地在日记上写道：“疲劳吗？疲劳。但是想到毛主席的教导，就觉得浑身是劲。这是自己的职责和本分。”
    梁振友同志坚持和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习。贫农社员陈天春知道他有胃病，想方设法特地给他蒸了白馍，又怕他不吃，把白馍放在锅上边，把自己吃的黑馍藏在下边。梁振友同志去吃饭时怎么也不肯吃白馍，再三给陈天春讲干部是人民的勤务员，应该和群众同甘共苦的道理。说着翻出蒸笼下边的黑馍就吃。工作组有些同志在群众家吃饭，有时不注意掉了些饭粒菜叶，他发现后，立即拣起来送到嘴里。他说：“我们是人民的勤务员，只有为人民服务的义务，没有抛撒人民一滴血汗的权利！”
    梁振友同志身体不好，但工作起来浑身有使不完的劲。他经常工作到深夜一两点钟才休息，天刚亮又和社员一道下地劳动。贫下中农劝他好好休息，他说：“为党为人民工作，一天二十四个小时怎么也不够我用。”就在他牺牲的前一天——七月二十八日，早晨，梁振友同大家一起学习了毛主席的好战士刘英俊的英雄事迹，帮助三个大队贫下中农排练了他们自己创作的五十多个歌颂党和毛主席的节目，研究了民兵工作的安排，拟定了十多天大队的工作计划，布置好第二天的工作，……一直紧张地工作到二十九日早晨四点钟才躺下休息。天刚亮，他又按时起床坚持“天天读”。谁也没有想到在一个小时后，就传来了他壮烈牺牲的消息。梁振友同志真正做到了毛主席所教导的“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    “活学活用毛主席著作是我毕生的战斗任务”
    “要学一辈子‘老三篇’，改造一辈子世界观”
    梁振友同志入党、参军后的二十年战斗历程中，念念不忘用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观。他在日记中写下了豪迈的誓言：“活学活用毛主席著作是我毕生的战斗任务”“我要学一辈子‘老三篇’，改造一辈子世界观”。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于人民的梁振友同志用自己踏踏实实的行动，实践了自己的誓言。他每前进一步，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    一九四九年春天，正当全国解放前夕，梁振友同志随部队南下，从农村进入大城市。他立即抄下了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中的一段话：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”他经常用这一段话来检查自己的一言一行，决心终生保持共产党人优良的政治品质。
    十七年来，从硝烟弥漫的战场到繁华的城市，从供给制改成薪金制，生活环境和物质条件变了，但梁振友时刻牢记毛主席的教导，艰苦朴素的作风一直没有变，严格防止资产阶级思想从生活领域打开缺口。历次政治运动中，他始终坚定不移地站在党的立场上，向一切阶级敌人和资产阶级思想作坚决的斗争。
    当中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把黑《修养》作为党课教材的时候，梁振友同志在思想上进行了坚决的抵制。他把黑《修养》抛到一边，认真地学习“老三篇”，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想抵制了《修养》中所鼓吹的“公私融合论”和“活命哲学”。早在一九五一年，梁振友同志就在日记中写道：“凡一切问题从‘我’考虑起的人，就是最危险的人。这样的人在监狱里将会向敌人屈服，叛变党，叛变人民的事业，在战场上，他将会成为可耻的逃兵。他的生命将会变得一钱不值，将比狗屎还要臭，被人民所永远唾弃。对一切问题，他考虑的不是‘我’，而是党和人民的利益，就会坚强起来，他的生命被魔鬼夺去，但精神不死！”
    凡是和梁振友同志一起工作过、生活过的人，没有一个不佩服他改造世界观的极端严格的精神。他对毛主席的教导，学了就用，持之以恒，一丝不苟。随着年龄的增长和责任的加重，他对自己思想改造的要求越来越高。
    在长期活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造世界观的过程中，梁振友同志总结了四条经验：“一不怕，不怕暴露自己的思想，不怕丢人，不怕批评；二承认，承认矛盾，承认斗争，承认自己的差距和落后；三斗争，对自己的非无产阶级思想，既要自己斗，也要发动大家斗；四总结，及时总结经验教训，不符合毛泽东思想的就改正，符合毛泽东思想的就发扬。”
    梁振友同志一直是这样做的。在“四清”运动中，有一次领导上转来一封群众批评工作组领导的信件，梁振友看后，立即检讨了自己的缺点，亲自组织工作组全体同志认真讨论，很快作了纠正。事后，他还把这封信抄在日记上，装在身上，时常看，借以鞭策自己。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，梁振友同志更加勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地破私立公。在他牺牲前二十几天写的一篇题为《进村三学〈为人民服务〉》的日记，表达了他不断在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观的决心：
      “树立革命人生观，
    要‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务。
    经常与‘我’字斗，
    严以律己时时不忘，
    视为人民而死是归宿。”
                     ×××
      “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”
    梁振友同志牺牲后，广大贫下中农怀着万分崇敬的心情，把他安葬在石头峪河畔。他们说：“老梁是为我们牺牲的。他活着的时候，天天帮助我们学毛主席著作，教育我们走社会主义道路。死后我们要把他葬在永星，让他看着我们永星办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，看着我们走向共产主义！”为了纪念这位优秀的无产阶级革命战士，社员们把石头峪河改名为烈士河，并在河边用砖石垒起了纪念碑。人民的好儿子——梁振友同志永远活在人民的心中！
    在光辉灿烂的一九六八年，梁振友烈士生前所在的部队和永星大队，进一步掀起了学习梁振友同志英雄事迹的热潮，广大指战员、贫下中农和革命干部，决心以梁振友同志为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
