Broad masses of community members are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, their spirits soaring, and their fighting spirit high. The revolution and production in the rural areas of Henan are booming.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou, the rural areas of Henan Province, which saw unprecedented bumper harvests in agricultural production last year, are currently experiencing a great situation in both revolution and winter production. At present, revolutionary cadres and community members across the province, following the great instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, are vigorously grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting winter production, preparing for spring plowing. They are determined that in 1968, the year of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will achieve even greater and more comprehensive bumper harvests in agricultural production.

In 1967, the year when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved decisive victories, all crops in Henan Province saw bumper harvests. Whether it was grain, cotton, or flue-cured tobacco, the yields were the highest since liberation. Livestock farming also saw significant development.

With the comprehensive and substantial increase in agricultural production, the amount of surplus grain handed over to the state by the production teams of people's communes across the province increased; collective reserve grain increased; community members' rations and income increased; the amount of cotton and flue-cured tobacco purchased by the state increased compared to the same period last year; the public accumulation of communes and teams increased. Along with these five increases, there appeared a stable urban and rural economy, a bustling market, and a prosperous scene everywhere.

Last year's bumper harvest in Henan Province's agricultural production is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a brilliant achievement of the broad revolutionary masses actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Broad community members deeply felt in their struggles that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for grasping the revolution, promoting production, and achieving bumper harvests in agriculture. Therefore, broad revolutionary masses, while vigorously grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting winter production, regard actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as the most important matter, placing it above everything, greater than everything, before everything, and heavier than everything. Now, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held everywhere across the province, with 3.85 million people participating in the study. Through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, community members' political awareness has significantly improved, and their spiritual outlook has greatly changed. Across the vast rural areas, a new situation has emerged where everyone's spirits are soaring, fighting spirit is high, and morale is boosted.

The high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has promoted the high tide of winter production, with a focus on small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects. Currently, various places are speeding up the excavation of irrigation channels, construction of ponds and reservoirs, and drilling of wells, with an increasing number of people participating.

In winter water conservancy construction, broad community members criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev's agents in Henan had promoted in water conservancy construction in the past. They carried forward the Dazhai spirit, implemented the policy of frugal water conservancy construction, focusing on small-scale projects, comprehensive matching, and local conditions, to carry out basic agricultural construction and build various water conservancy projects. They also vigorously managed the water conservancy projects to better serve agricultural production.

Various places, in winter production, regard strengthening the field management of wheat as an important task to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. Currently, various places are seizing the opportunity to carry out fertilization, ditch cleaning, and inter-tilling in wheat fields. Some places have also conducted winter irrigation. Therefore, most of the wheat across the province has good roots and grows well.

Learning from Chairman Mao's works, linking them with reality, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, promote everything, and transform everything, is a distinctive feature of Henan Province's winter production this year. Through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, broad community members have criticized and repudiated revisionism, with revolutionary spirit greatly promoted. In winter production, they fear neither cold nor hardship, go up mountains and down rivers, and rush forward enthusiastically. Their production enthusiasm is very high.

    广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，精神振奋，斗志昂扬
    河南农村革命和生产热气腾腾
    据新华社郑州电　去年农业生产获得空前大丰收的河南省广大农村，革命和冬季生产形势一片大好。目前，各地革命干部和社员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在中国人民解放军的大力支持下，正在狠抓革命，猛促冬季生产，为春耕进行准备，他们决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一九六八年，在农业生产上取得更大更全面的丰收。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一九六七年，河南省各项农作物都获得了大丰收，不论是粮食、棉花或者烤烟，产量都是解放以来最高的一年。畜牧业也有很大的发展。
    随着农业的全面大幅度增产，全省农村人民公社生产队向国家交售的余粮增加；集体的储备粮增加；社员的口粮和收入增加；国家收购的棉花、烤烟比去年同期增加；社、队的公共积累增加。和这五增加的同时出现的是，城乡物价稳定，市场繁荣，到处是欣欣向荣的景象。
    去年河南省农业生产的大丰收，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的辉煌成果。广大社员在斗争的实践中深深体会到，毛泽东思想是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利最根本的保证，也是抓革命促生产，夺取农业大丰收最根本的保证。因此，广大革命群众在狠抓革命、猛促冬季生产的活动中，把活学活用毛主席著作，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，当做头等重要的大事，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置。现在，全省到处都在大办毛泽东思想学习班，有三百八十五万人参加了学习。社员们通过活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，政治觉悟大大提高，精神面貌大大改变，在广阔的农村中，到处出现了人人精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发的新局面。
    活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，促进了以兴修小型农田水利为重点的冬季生产高潮。目前，各地开拓排灌渠道、修建塘堰、钻打机井等工作正在加紧进行，上工的人数越来越多。
    在冬季水利建设中，广大社员批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在河南的代理人过去在水利建设上所推行的反革命修正主义路线，发扬了大寨精神，实行勤俭办水利的方针，以小型为主，全面配套，因地制宜地进行农田基本建设，修建各种水利工程，并且狠抓管理，使水利工程更好地为农业生产服务。
    各地在冬季生产中，把加强小麦的田间管理，作为争取今年农业全面大丰收的一项重要任务。现在，各地正在抓紧时机，开展麦田的追肥、清沟和中耕工作，有的还进行了冬灌。因此，全省绝大部分小麦盘根好，长得好。
    学习毛主席著作联系实际，斗私批修，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，推动一切，改造一切，这是今年河南省冬季生产的一个鲜明特点。广大社员通过活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，革命精神大发扬，在冬季生产中，不畏严寒，不畏艰险，上山下水，争先恐后，生产热情十分高涨。
