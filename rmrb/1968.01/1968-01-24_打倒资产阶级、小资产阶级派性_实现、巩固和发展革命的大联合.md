In the great mass movement to thoroughly implement the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, and in the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people throughout the country have resolved to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, further strengthen proletarian party spirit, achieve, consolidate, and develop the great alliance of revolution, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Since the beginning of the brilliant year 1968, a vigorous mass movement to seriously study and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has swept across the country. Proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in various places have deeply studied the New Year's Day editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, as well as the recent editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism" published by Wenhui Bao. They have also studied the articles "Proletarian Revolutionaries, Unite!" by the editorial departments of Wenhui Bao, Liberation Daily, and the Workers' Rebel News. The broad revolutionary masses have received profound education. They say that the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a big poisonous snake, a major enemy obstructing the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the seizure of complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the enemy in front, we must encircle and annihilate it, thoroughly overthrow it, and thoroughly expose it! They resolve to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use proletarian party spirit to guide all their actions, and become "proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

The New Year's Day editorial points out: "Whether or not one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a genuine proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." In the course of struggle, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people deeply feel that whether to uphold proletarian party spirit or be led by the nose by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a severe test for every revolutionary comrade. Revolutionary workers in Beijing have launched a mass movement to thoroughly expose the true colors of factionalism, list the crimes of factionalism, and uproot the roots of factionalism, making bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism a universally despised "street rat," and resolving to make new contributions to further consolidating and developing the great alliance of revolution. Revolutionary workers in Shanghai have studied the article by the editorial departments of the three Shanghai newspapers and received a living class struggle lesson. Workers at the Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant say that the black hands that sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were able to infiltrate because they took advantage of the factionalism of some comrades in the revolutionary ranks. The editorial of the New Anhui Daily says well: The enemy uses factionalism, and factionalism shields the enemy. When class enemies cannot openly hoist the banner of counter-revolution, they change their appearance and play the two-faced trick of counter-revolution, luring those whose minds are bewitched by factionalism and selfishness to be their tools for counter-revolutionary restoration. After studying, the workers have become more determined to consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination.

The day after the article by the editorial departments of the three Shanghai newspapers was published, more than ten million proletarian revolutionaries led by the working class in Nanjing held a rally to denounce in anger the counter-revolutionary clique and its ringleaders, such as Chen X and Bao XX, who split the proletarian revolutionary ranks, created serious armed clashes, sabotaged the Cultural Revolution along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and its lines, and were part of the old Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee. In recent periods, revolutionary workers in various factories and enterprises in Nanjing have further studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, enhanced their proletarian party spirit, and resolved to accelerate the achievement of the great alliance of revolution. In the department where the counter-revolutionary element Zhang XX, exposed in the article by the editorial departments of the three Shanghai newspapers, is located, the two revolutionary mass factions originally decided to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly settle the accounts of the crimes of Zhang XX and a handful of counter-revolutionary elements. Now, the two revolutionary mass factions have reached an agreement on the great alliance of revolution.

In Wuhan, the leaders and revolutionary masses of various revolutionary mass organizations of the First Metallurgical Construction Company exposed and denounced the crimes of factionalism, enhanced party spirit, and quickly reversed the situation where they had discussed dozens of times since last September but failed to unite, achieving the great alliance of revolution. Workers of the Jiangxi Oil and Fat Chemical Factory, who have just achieved the great alliance of revolution, say, "A thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, listen to Chairman Mao's words, overthrow factionalism, enhance party spirit, unite, and fight the enemy together—that is the greatest reason." They held a "Besiege Factionalism Mobilization Meeting" and a demonstration to overthrow factionalism, resolving to further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students of Shijiazhuang No. 1 Middle School held a symposium, listing twenty-two crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They say: Once captured by factionalism, one's eyes cannot see the enemy, and one's nose loses the sense of class struggle, possibly being used by class enemies. We must thoroughly overthrow factionalism. More than 95% of the units under the Tianjin Railway Bureau have achieved the great alliance of revolution and established the bureau's revolutionary committee. Revolutionary workers of this bureau say, "Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, like all reactionary things, if you do not strike it down, it will not fall. Even if it is temporarily overthrown, under suitable conditions, it will rise again. We must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, constantly enhance proletarian party spirit, thoroughly eradicate factionalism, and consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution."

Proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in various places emphasize that to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, one must thoroughly study and apply the "Old Five Articles," fiercely struggle against the bourgeois "self," and firmly establish the proletarian "public." They also express their determination to strive to learn and apply the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Comrades of the Great Alliance Preparatory Committee in Hefei say, "In the past, because our minds were plagued by selfishness and factionalism flared up, we could not listen to Chairman Mao's words, treating class brothers as enemies and enemies as friends, helping the enemy and harming ourselves. It is truly heartbreaking to think about it. Recently, we have used the 'Old Five Articles' as a weapon of thought, broken away from selfishness and established the public, overthrown bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, brightened our eyes, distinguished between enemies and us, and exposed the spies, traitors, and other bad elements who had infiltrated our ranks. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people to resolve the differences among our revolutionary mass organizations. Revolutionary masses studying in the Mao Zedong Thought classes held by the Provincial Workers' Congress and some colleges and universities in Zhejiang say, "A handful of class enemies use bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism as their protective umbrella. We must spark a revolution in the depths of our souls, take the lead in besieging factionalism, promote the great alliance of revolution, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Proletarian revolutionaries in Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Jinan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Changsha, and other places say, "The fundamental way to eradicate factionalism is to thoroughly study and apply the 'Old Five Articles,' study them every day, use them every day, touch the soul fiercely, and transform thoughts. Only by struggling against the 'self' in one's mind and firmly establishing the 'public' can one uproot the roots of factionalism."

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Our people's eyes are not bright; they are not good at distinguishing between good and bad people. We are good at distinguishing between good and bad people who act in normal situations, but we are not good at distinguishing between certain people who act in special situations."

Proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses throughout the country, after studying this teaching of Chairman Mao, unanimously declare: We must master Mao Zedong Thought, this extremely sharp weapon, brighten our eyes, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, thoroughly overthrow factionalism, cut off the black hands, unite, and fight the enemy together, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性
    实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众决心掌握毛主席最新指示这一锐利武器，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把革命警惕性提得高高的，团结起来，共同对敌，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社二十三日讯　在全面落实伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的伟大群众运动中，在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，全国广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，决心彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进一步加强无产阶级党性，实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    进入光辉灿烂的一九六八年以来，全国各地掀起了一个认真学习、全面落实毛主席最新指示的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众深入学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，学习了最近发表的《文汇报》社论《论派性的反动性》，又学习了《文汇报》、《解放日报》和《工人造反报》编辑部的文章《无产阶级革命派，联合起来！》广大革命群众受到了深刻的教育。他们说，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一条大毒蛇，是全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌。大敌当前，我们必须围而攻之，聚而歼之，把它彻底打倒，彻底搞臭！他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用无产阶级党性指导自己的一切行动，做一个“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
    元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在斗争实践中深切地体会到，究竟是坚持无产阶级党性，还是被资产阶级、小资产阶级派性牵着鼻子走，这是对每个革命同志的严峻考验。北京市广大革命职工掀起了大剥派性画皮，大列派性罪状，大挖派性老根的群众运动，把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性搞成人人喊打的“过街老鼠”，决心为进一步巩固发展革命大联合立新功。上海广大无产阶级革命派学习了上海三报编辑部文章，上了一堂活生生的阶级斗争教育课。上钢三厂的革命职工说，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的黑手所以能伸进来，一个重要原因就是利用了我们革命队伍中某些同志的派性。《新安徽报》社论说得好：敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人。阶级敌人在不能明目张胆地打出反革命旗号时，就改头换面，玩弄反革命两面手法，引诱那些被派性和“私”字迷住心窍的人做他们反革命复辟的工具。职工们经过学习，更加坚定了巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合的决心。
    上海三报编辑部文章发表的第二天，南京市以工人阶级为主的广大无产阶级革命派十多万人举行集会，愤怒声讨分裂无产阶级革命派、制造严重武斗事件、破坏沪宁铁路运输和铁路沿线文化大革命的现行反革命集团及其首恶分子、旧江苏省委内一小撮走资派陈×、包××等。最近一个时期内，南京市各工厂企业的革命职工进一步学习毛主席的最新指示，增强了无产阶级党性，决心加快实现革命大联合。在上海三报编辑部文章中揭露的反革命分子张××所在的江苏省××厅，原来的两派革命群众决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来，彻底清算张××等一小撮反革命分子的罪行。现在，两派革命群众已经达成了革命大联合的协议。
    在武汉，第一冶金建设公司各革命群众组织的负责人和革命群众，揭露和控诉了派性的罪状，增强了党性，很快扭转了他们自去年九月以来商谈数十次未能联合起来的局面，实现了革命大联合。刚刚实现革命大联合的江西油脂化工厂职工说，千条理，万条理，听毛主席的话，打倒派性，增强党性，联合起来，共同对敌，是最大的理。他们召开了“围剿派性誓师大会”，举行了打倒派性的示威游行，决心进一步巩固和发展革命大联合。石家庄市新一中的革命师生举行座谈会，历数了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的二十二条罪状。他们说：当了派性的俘虏，眼睛就看不到敌人，鼻子没有阶级斗争的嗅觉，就可能被阶级敌人利用。我们一定要彻底打倒派性。天津铁路分局所属的百分之九十五以上的单位已经实现了革命大联合，并成立了分局革命委员会。这个分局的革命职工说，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，同一切反动的东西一样，你不打，它就不倒。一时打倒了，有了适当的气候，还会重新抬头。我们必须用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断地斗私批修，不断地增强无产阶级党性，彻底根除派性，巩固和发展革命大联合。
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众强调指出，要彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，必须大学大用“老五篇”，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，改造世界观。他们还表示，要努力学习运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾。合肥地区大联合筹备委员会的同志说，我们过去由于头脑里“私”字作怪，派性发作，毛主席的话听不进去，把阶级兄弟当成敌人，把敌人当成朋友，帮了敌人，害了自己，想起来真是痛心。最近，我们以“老五篇”为思想武器，破私立公，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，眼睛亮了，分清敌我，揪出了混进我们队伍里的特务、叛徒等坏人。我们要坚决按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，解决我们革命群众组织之间的分歧。在浙江省工代会和部分大专院校分别举办的毛泽东思想学习班里学习的革命群众组织负责人说，一小撮阶级敌人把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，当作他们的保护伞。我们一定要在灵魂深处爆发革命，带头围歼派性，促进革命的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。广州、兰州、成都、济南、西安、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、长沙等地的无产阶级革命派说，铲除派性的根本办法，是大学大用“老五篇”，天天学，天天用，狠触灵魂，改造思想。只有斗掉头脑里的“私”字，牢固地树立起“公”字，才能挖掉派性的根子。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的人眼睛不亮，不善于辨别好人和坏人。我们善于辨别在正常情况之下从事活动的好人和坏人，但是我们不善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。”
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众学习了毛主席的这一教导，一致表示，我们一定要掌握毛泽东思想这个无比锐利的武器，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把革命警惕性提得高高的，彻底打倒派性，斩断黑手，团结起来，共同对敌，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
