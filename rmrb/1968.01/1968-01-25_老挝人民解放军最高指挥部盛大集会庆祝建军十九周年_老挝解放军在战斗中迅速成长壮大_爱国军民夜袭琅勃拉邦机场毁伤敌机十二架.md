The Lao People's Liberation Army General Command recently held a grand meeting to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army.

Those attending the meeting included Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Kaysone Phomvihane, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Khamtai Siphandon, and representatives from various units and organizations totaling over 300 people.

Kaysone Phomvihane spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

He said, "Over the past 19 years, the Lao People's Liberation Army has achieved rapid and continuous growth in all aspects. This people's army, starting from small armed propaganda teams and guerrilla units, has grown stronger and more victorious with each battle. Now, it has developed into a powerful force including main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units, with high political awareness and high tactical and technical levels."

He said, "The Lao patriotic military and people have taken the initiative on the battlefield, defeating the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' encroachment and attacks on the liberated areas. The enemy has suffered heavy defeats, falling into a passive and chaotic situation militarily and completely isolated politically. The morale of the enemy troops is declining, and contradictions within the enemy are intensifying. All these clearly indicate that U.S. imperialism is doomed to suffer a thorough defeat."

Khamtai Siphandon presented medals and certificates of honor to the outstanding units at the meeting.

According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, on the night of January 14, the Lao patriotic military and people attacked the Luang Prabang Airport, destroying and damaging 12 enemy aircraft and eliminating 42 enemy personnel.

On the night of January 14, while fiercely defeating the right-wing Lao military in the Nam Bao area north of Luang Prabang and liberating this important strategic region, the patriotic military and people launched a powerful attack on Luang Prabang Airport.

This was the third attack on Luang Prabang Airport since February 2, 1967.

    新华社康开二十三日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部最近举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝老挝人民解放军建军十九周年。
    出席集会的有：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席凯山·丰威汉，老挝人民解放军最高指挥坎代·西番顿以及各部队、各团体代表等三百多人。
    凯山·丰威汉在会上代表老挝爱国战线党中央委员会讲了话。
    他说，十九年来，老挝人民解放军在各方面取得了迅速的和不断的成长。这支人民军队从小小的武装宣传队和游击队开始，越战越强，越战越胜。现在，已发展成为一支包括主力部队、地方部队和游击队的、具有高度政治觉悟和高度战术技术水平的强大力量。
    他说，老挝爱国军民掌握着战场的主动权，击败了美帝国主义及其走狗对解放区的蚕食进攻。敌人遭到了惨重失败，在军事上陷于被动和混乱的境地，在政治上陷于完全孤立。敌军的士气日益低落，敌人内部矛盾加剧。这些情况都清楚表明：美帝国主义注定要遭到彻底的失败。
    坎代·西番顿在会上给各有功部队授予了奖章和奖状。
    新华社康开二十四日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国军民在一月十四日夜间袭击琅勃拉邦机场的战斗中，共击毁击伤敌机十二架，消灭敌人四十二名。
    老挝爱国军民十四日夜间在痛歼琅勃拉邦以北南博地区的老挝右派军队，并且解放了这个重要战略地区的同时，猛烈袭击了琅勃拉邦机场。
    这是爱国军民从去年二月二日以来对琅勃拉邦机场的第三次袭击。
