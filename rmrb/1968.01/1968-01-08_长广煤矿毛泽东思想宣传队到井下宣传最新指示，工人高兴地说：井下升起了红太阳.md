The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Changguang Coal Mine went underground to spread the latest directives, and the workers joyfully exclaimed: "A red sun has risen underground!"

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Changguang Coal Mine in Zhejiang used to perform in the mine's auditorium and on stage. Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, the team members said, "The propagation of Mao Zedong Thought should not be limited to the stage. We must be models in executing and spreading the latest directives, taking Chairman Mao's latest directives to the coal mining front lines!"

They acted immediately. The next day, this amateur propaganda team, consisting of twenty-five young workers and coal school students, each wearing a miner's helmet, dressed in mining uniforms, and wearing long boots, sang "Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I march forward," carrying red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and headed to the underground mines, a thousand feet below the surface.

The underground mine passages are crisscrossed with tracks and switches. During the performances, it was easy to trip and fall. However, the difficulties did not deter the propaganda team members. They said, "Comrade Li Wentong sacrificed his life to protect Chairman Mao. For us to spread Mao Zedong Thought, a little difficulty is nothing!" Thus, they navigated through the passages and climbed over the "small holes" to reach various workfaces and operation points. In the underground mine, during rest periods, they performed for the coal miners on the front lines, bringing them the voice of Chairman Mao and his greatest concern. They also expressed the miners' boundless love for Chairman Mao. The workers could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Everywhere the propaganda team performed, the workers were enthusiastic and welcoming. The workers said, "The propaganda team brought the great Mao Zedong Thought, making a red sun rise forever underground." The team members said, "In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party did not allow us to go underground, fearing that the coal miners would grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We insist on going underground; we want Mao Zedong Thought to directly meet the underground workers." The team members are determined to launch a comprehensive campaign to spread the latest directives soon, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, taking the latest directives underground, letting Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout every corner of the mine, inspiring all the mine workers to redouble their efforts, strive for the forefront, and achieve continuous victories, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

After the publication of the New Year editorial "Greeting the Comprehensive Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," a wave of learning, spreading, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives is rapidly sweeping across the country.

Bringing Chairman Mao's voice directly to the masses, making Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and the party's various policies directly grasped by the broad masses of the people, and turning them into the conscious revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, is the fundamental guarantee for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The reports published here vividly illustrate that once Chairman Mao's latest directives are directly grasped by the masses, they can be transformed into tremendous material force!

These comrades in the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have paid attention to some corners that are often overlooked by people and have gone to places where few cadres have gone in the past, bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the doorstep, achieving remarkable results. This work spirit and style are worth learning.

    长广煤矿毛泽东思想宣传队到井下宣传最新指示，工人高兴地说：
    井下升起了红太阳
    浙江长广煤矿的毛泽东思想宣传队，过去都是在矿区的礼堂里、舞台上进行演出。最近，他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，大伙说：“宣传毛泽东思想不能受舞台限制，我们要做执行最新指示和宣传最新指示的模范，把毛主席的最新指示送到采煤第一线去！”
    说干就干。第二天，这支由二十五个青年工人和煤校学生组成的业余宣传队，个个头顶矿灯，身穿矿工服，脚登长靴，唱着“毛主席挥手我前进”的战歌，带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，走向离地面千尺的井下。
    矿井底下的巷道里，铁轨、道岔纵横，表演时一不当心就会摔倒。但是困难吓不倒宣传队队员。他们说：“李文忠同志为了保卫毛主席献出了自己的生命，我们宣传毛泽东思想，碰到一点困难算得了什么！”就这样，他们穿过一条条巷道，爬过了一个个“小眼”，来到各个工作面、作业点，在井下利用休息时间，为采煤第一线的工人演出了一场又一场。那一首首雄壮激昂、威力无穷的毛主席语录歌，那一曲曲充满阶级感情的对伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌，给井下工人带来了毛主席的声音，带来了毛主席的最大关怀，也表达了工人对毛主席无比热爱的心情。工人们情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    宣传队每到一处演出，工人们都兴高采烈，十分欢迎。工人们说：“宣传队带来了伟大的毛泽东思想，使井下升起了永远不落的红太阳。”宣传队的同志说：“过去，党内一小撮走资派不让我们下井，怕煤矿工人掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们偏偏要下井，我们要使毛泽东思想直接和井下工人见面。”队员们决心要在最近掀起一个全面宣传最新指示的热潮，以最大的热情，最快的速度，把最新指示送到井下，让毛泽东思想传遍矿山的每一个角落，激励全矿职工鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    元旦社论《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》发表后，全国各地正在迅速掀起一个学习、宣传和贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的热潮。
    把毛主席的声音直接传播到群众中去，使毛主席的光辉思想和党的各项政策，为广大人民群众所直接掌握，变为亿万革命人民自觉的革命行动，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最根本保证。
    这里发表的几篇报道生动地说明，毛主席的最新指示一旦为广大群众所直接掌握，就能化为巨大的物质力量！
    这些毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，注意到了过去常常为人们所忽略的一些角落，走到了过去很少有干部去的一些地方，把毛泽东思想送上门去，收到了显著的效果。这种工作精神和工作作风，值得学习。
