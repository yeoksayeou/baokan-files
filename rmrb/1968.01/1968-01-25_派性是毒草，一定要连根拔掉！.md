The two major revolutionary mass organizations in our factory frequently engaged in factionalism and "internal warfare" in the past. Each side claimed to be a "resounding" revolutionary faction, labeling the other as "conservative," attacking each other, and exposing each other's shortcomings in every possible way to try to bring down the other side. The result was that it disrupted the overall direction of the struggle and interfered with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Last September, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadre, we mobilized the masses to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, which led to the realization of the great alliance between the two major revolutionary mass organizations and the establishment of the revolutionary committee.

Reflecting on this process, we realized that only by overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. To thoroughly overthrow factionalism, the most important thing is to mobilize the broad masses of workers with Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletariat has a firm stance, is highly organized and disciplined, and has a strong sense of the enemy. They are against factionalism. Some old workers, seeing the big-character posters attacking each other, said, "These young people are brave and daring, which is good, but they lack experience in class struggle. They let the enemy off the hook and fight 'internal wars.' We have no interest in that!" Some old workers told the leaders, "We have the imperialists, revisionists, and capitalist-roaders, ghosts, and monsters inside and outside. You let the enemy off the hook and fight with your own class brothers, how can that be?"

After Chairman Mao's latest directive that "within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions" was issued, the workers were overjoyed and urged the leaders to quickly achieve a great revolutionary alliance. Some old workers, tears in their eyes, said, "We workers have no conflicts of interest. We are all bitter gourds on the same vine. It was the Chinese Khrushchev who split us into two factions. We must listen to Chairman Mao and achieve a great revolutionary alliance!" Under the pressure of the masses, the two revolutionary mass organizations in our factory united.

However, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are very stubborn and will emerge at any opportunity. Although the two factions in our factory have united organizationally, they have once again engaged in factionalism over the issue of seating arrangements, each with their own hidden agendas, arguing and making a fuss.

What to do? Chairman Mao said, "We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." With the help of the PLA's leftist cadre, we held Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory. Initially, some leaders were reluctant to give up factionalism, adopting a "you fight as much as I fight" approach, watching each other. The workers were very dissatisfied with this and urged them to fight factionalism while criticizing the leaders, saying, "You responded to Chairman Mao's call to rebel against the capitalist-roaders in the past, and we supported you. Now, if you do not respond to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and eliminate factionalism, we will rebel against you!" Seeing that some leaders did not fight factionalism thoroughly, hiding some and exposing some, the workers said, "Fighting factionalism is not like cutting leeks, it is like weeding out poisonous plants. Cutting leeks leaves the roots, and they will grow again. Factionalism is a poisonous plant and must be uprooted!" Some leaders fought well, and the workers praised them, saying, "Now that's what a revolutionary looks like! You follow Chairman Mao's correct path, and we will firmly support you."

Under the pressure of the worker masses, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations voluntarily exposed their "private" thoughts and fought their factionalism. They revealed past "top-secret" incidents of factionalism. A leader of a mass organization said, "This time we can go to battle lightly! In the past, factionalism made us dizzy, but now we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and it's clear as day!" They not only fought factionalism within their own organizations but also went to the opposing organizations to fight. In this way, they eliminated the barriers caused by factionalism in the past, truly increased unity in thought, consolidated the great revolutionary alliance, and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    派性是毒草，一定要连根拔掉！
    北京综合仪器厂革命委员会
    我们厂两大派革命群众组织，过去经常闹派性，打“内战”。各方都称自己是“响当当”的造反派，称对方为“保守派”，互相攻击，互揭短处，千方百计想搞垮对方。结果是干扰了斗争的大方向，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    去年九月，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，发动群众围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，才促使两大派革命群众组织实现了革命大联合，进而建立了革命委员会。
    回顾这段过程，我们体会到，只有打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。要彻底打倒派性，最重要的就是要用毛泽东思想发动广大工人群众。
    工人阶级立场坚定，最有组织性和纪律性，敌情观念强。他们是反对闹派性的。有的老工人看到两派互相攻击的大字报时，就说：
  “这些小青年敢冲敢闯是好的，但是他们缺少阶级斗争的经验，放开敌人，尽打‘内战’，我们没兴趣！”有的老工人找头头说：“咱们外有美帝苏修，内有走资派、牛鬼蛇神，你们放着敌人不打，尽和自己的阶级兄弟干，怎么行呢！”
    毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示发表以后，工人们欢欣鼓舞，督促头头赶快实现革命大联合。有的老工人热泪盈眶地说：“我们工人和工人就是没有利害冲突，我们都是一条藤上的苦瓜，是中国的赫鲁晓夫把我们分成两派，我们一定要听毛主席的话，实现革命的大联合！”在群众的推动下，我们厂的两派革命群众组织联合起来了。
    但是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是十分顽固的，一有机会，就要冒头。我们厂两派虽然在组织上联合了，在席位问题上又派性大发作。各怀鬼胎，大吵大闹。
    怎么办？毛主席说：“要斗私，批修”。在解放军支左人员的帮助下，我们在全厂大办毛泽东思想学习班。最初，有的头头对派性恋恋不舍，采取“你斗多少，我也斗多少”的办法，互相观望。工人看了很不满意，他们就一面带头斗派性，一面批评头头说：“你们从前响应毛主席号召，造走资派的反，我们拥护。现在你们要是不响应毛主席的号召，斗掉‘私’字，去掉派性，我们可要造你们的反！”看到有的头头斗派性不彻底，斗点藏点，工人就说：“斗派性可不是割韭菜，是锄毒草。割韭菜留根，是要长二茬的。派性是毒草，非连根拔掉不可！”有的头头斗得好，工人就表扬，说：“这还象个造反派！你们按照毛主席指的正道走，我们坚决支持。”
    在工人群众的督促下，革命群众组织的负责人都自觉地亮自己的“私”心，斗自己的派性。把过去一些搞派性的“绝密事件”，都倒了出来。一个群众组织的负责人说：“这回可以轻装上阵啦！从前让派性缠得人晕头转向，现在按照毛主席指示办事，真是心明眼亮！”他们不仅在本组织的群众中斗派性，而且到对立的组织的群众中去斗。这样，消除了从前在派性斗争中造成的隔阂，真正从思想上增进了团结，巩固了革命大联合，促进了革命三结合。
