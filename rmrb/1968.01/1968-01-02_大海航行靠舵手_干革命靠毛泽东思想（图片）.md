Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsperson Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, met with revolutionary fighters. Chairman Mao, with a beaming smile, repeatedly waved and clapped to express his warm greetings to the entire audience. Instantly, the entire scene erupted in joy. Hearts aflame burned in the chests of every revolutionary fighter, and faces of happiness greeted the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao. Ten thousand people shouted in unison: Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving revolutionary fighters is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest happiness for the entire military and civilian population nationwide.
