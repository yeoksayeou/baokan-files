An Inspiring Revolutionary Scene

In the place where the good student of Chairman Mao, Comrade Jiao Yulu, worked and fought—Lankao County, Henan Province—after undergoing the unprecedented baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great situation has emerged.

Over the past year, on this heroic land, a heart-pounding struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads has taken place. The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in the county resolutely want to uphold the banner of Comrade Jiao Yulu, who carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee and the stubborn conservative forces they controlled tried every means to cut down this banner. The class line has never been so clear; class struggle has never been so intense. Now, the proletarian revolutionaries of Lankao—the largest revolutionary organization of poor and lower-middle peasants in the county, "Lankao Guards Jiao"—have achieved a decisive victory in this struggle. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is so deeply rooted in people's hearts and radiates so brightly. The black line of Liu Shaoqi that infiltrated Lankao has long been despised by millions of people like a plague. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee has become a rat that everyone wants to beat. The Revolutionary Committee of Lankao County, led by Comrade Zhang Qingli, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Jiao Yulu, has been born in glory amidst the revolutionary storm.

Stepping onto the heroic land of Lankao, a thriving revolutionary scene will immediately captivate you. Walking into every village and town, large or small, many male and female commune members, even white-haired elders, all wear red badges of "Lankao Guards Jiao." As soon as they see you, they greet you warmly and, with boundless reverence, praise our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

Here, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in every commune and production team.

Here, whether it is on the streets, in the offices of production teams, or on the river excavation sites, revolutionary big-character posters denouncing Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the "three selfs and one contract" are everywhere.

Currently, it is the dead of winter. The earth is frozen, and the north wind howls. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the boundless enthusiasm unleashed by the Cultural Revolution, are engaged in a fiery winter production campaign. Squads of male and female commune members, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, carrying copies of Chairman Mao's quotations, waving red flags, and singing revolutionary songs, march in unison towards the fields like a team of valiant soldiers. On the flat land, people are moving "iron arms" and wielding "silver hoes" with the spirit of moving mountains, digging rivers and canals, to use the water of the Yellow River to transform the long-standing saline-alkali land into fertile rice fields. On the sand dunes, people are planting poplar trees extensively, to give Lankao County a new look. The vast land of Lankao is adorned with red flags, bustling with people, and resonating with songs.

The heroic people of Lankao are welcoming the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with doubled confidence and courage; they are continuing the unfinished magnificent work of Comrade Jiao Yulu with heroic labor.

Class Struggle Takes a Tortuous Path

The great situation in Lankao did not fall from the sky or blow in with a gust of wind; it was won through arduous and unyielding struggles by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Lankao County, with their loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao.

The class struggle in Lankao County has taken a tortuous path.

Before 1962, the first secretary of the county committee, Wang X, was a loyal disciple of Liu Shaoqi in Lankao County. As soon as he arrived in Lankao, he looked down on this place that had suffered disasters year after year. Instead of leading the people of the entire county to fight against natural disasters, he brought a bamboo bed and a rattan chair to the best soil areas to "stay in place." During the three years of economic difficulty, Liu Shaoqi took the opportunity to issue the black guideline of "three selfs and one contract." Wang X, delighted, praised "three selfs and one contract" as a "life-saving policy," a "survival policy," and a "policy to tie people down" (to prevent refugees from fleeing). Ignoring the opposition of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, he pushed forward the "three selfs and one contract" pilot project in Chengguan Commune, loudly promoting his black goods of "contracting land to households and feeding livestock in separate stalls." At that time, land that was nominally "borrowed" or "reclaimed" and actually usurped accounted for 33.2% of the total collective cultivated land. In Huji Village of Chengguan Commune, except for the land for public grain, 97% of the collective cultivated land was distributed to households.

With the revival of capitalist forces, class enemies began to stir. They incited commune members to go it alone everywhere, wantonly destroying the collective economy. Trees were cut down, and the irrigation system was damaged. The entire Lankao disaster area saw rising salinity, increased waterlogging, barren land, and heavy sandstorms. Serious natural disasters struck the 380,000 people of the county once again.

Just at this critical moment—December 1962—Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, arrived in Lankao County on behalf of the Party, carrying the shining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

Comrade Jiao Yulu was truly a good student of Chairman Mao. After arriving in Lankao, his first task was to "raise the banner and grasp the key"—to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to firmly grasp the key of class struggle. In the disaster-stricken Lankao County, he extensively carried out the education of recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness, mobilizing and inspiring the socialist enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the county, severely striking the capitalist restoration activities of class enemies, greatly boosting the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and greatly suppressing the arrogance of capitalist forces. With strong class feelings, he entered the cow sheds of production teams and the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, enthusiastically praising the new things of self-reliance and striving for progress that emerged among the poor and lower-middle peasants, and wholeheartedly supporting the poor and lower-middle peasants' firm will and determination to walk the socialist road. He personally established four model brigades in the county: the spirit of Han Village, the determination of Qin Village, the vigor of Zhao Doupolo, and the road of Shuangyang Tree. This further inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire county to fight natural disasters with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit. After three years of hard work, they basically controlled the sandstorms, tamed the floods, and transformed the saline-alkali land. Lankao, which had suffered disasters year after year, achieved a good harvest for the first time.

The people of Lankao never forget their roots. They always remember Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student. They say: "Whatever Chairman Mao says, Comrade Jiao does. His words hit the mark, and his deeds satisfy us. He is truly our poor and lower-middle peasants' trusted friend."

After Comrade Jiao Yulu passed away, Comrade Zhang Qingli, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Jiao Yulu and the deputy secretary of the county committee, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and continued to follow in Comrade Jiao Yulu's footsteps. He entered the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, ate with them, and fought against nature with them, contributing to the construction of a more beautiful socialist new Lankao.

However, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in Lankao County did not end there.

After Comrade Jiao Yulu passed away, another county committee secretary came, named Zhou X. This person was not on the same wavelength as the poor and lower-middle peasants. As soon as he arrived in Lankao, he wanted to cut down the red flag of Chairman Mao's good student, Comrade Jiao Yulu, which was personally inscribed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. In his view: "The disasters in Lankao County have not been reduced, the sandstorms have not been covered, and the spirit has not been turned into material." He even said: "What will we show the nation? The sandstorms and saline-alkali land?"

After Comrade Jiao Yulu's model deeds were widely publicized, hundreds of millions of people across the country were deeply moved. Every day, people came to Lankao to visit and tour. They asked Zhou X to introduce Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, but Zhou X coldly said: "I just arrived and don't know the situation. Let Zhang Qingli introduce it!" After Zhang Qingli introduced it, Zhou X harbored resentment and slandered Zhang Qingli everywhere, saying, "Promoting Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds is to seek political capital." One wanted to promote Comrade Jiao Yulu, and the other wanted to deny Comrade Jiao Yulu. The struggle between the two lines in Lankao County intensified day by day.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Bravely Join the Cultural Revolution

In June 1966, the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally ignited by Chairman Mao, blazed up. In Lankao, as soon as the Cultural Revolution began, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee, led by Zhou X, accused others first. They deceived some of the masses, shifted the direction of the struggle, and directed the spearhead straight at Comrade Zhang Qingli, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Jiao Yulu.

"Zhang Qingli is a political thief!"

"Zhang Qingli is a three-antis element!"

Suddenly, the wind of evil blew, and the mist of demons spread. Thousands of groundless big-character posters rained down on Comrade Zhang Qingli.

"What's going on?"

"Did Comrade Zhang Qingli make a mistake in promoting Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds?"

"Why do some people in the county committee want to cut down Comrade Jiao Yulu's banner? Why do they want to label Comrade Jiao Yulu's close comrade-in-arms as a three-antis element?"

A series of questions made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lankao unable to remain silent any longer.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao are deeply impoverished and have a high level of socialist consciousness. In the old society, who knows how many people fled, begged for food, and sold their children and grandchildren... They will never forget that it was Chairman Mao who saved them from the abyss of suffering and gave them today's sweet life. They will never forget that Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Lankao with Chairman Mao's red banner. He devoted his life to the 380,000 people of Lankao. Comrade Jiao Yulu and Comrade Zhang Qingli are both from Chairman Mao's headquarters; they are like melons on the same vine with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Only people like Wang X and Zhou X are not on the same wavelength with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Originally, Zhou X was supposed to take over from Comrade Jiao Yulu, but he came to Lankao for two years without making a single friend among the poor and lower-middle peasants. They opposed Zhang Qingli, attempting to use the opposition to Zhang Qingli to oppose Comrade Jiao Yulu, to oppose the poor and lower-middle peasants, and to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They wanted to cut down Comrade Jiao Yulu's banner from the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, which was absolutely impossible.

Therefore, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao paid great attention to this Cultural Revolution. They insisted on production during the day and actively made revolution at night. Whoever opposed Zhang Qingli, they would debate with them.

Just at this time, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" (the Sixteen Points) personally formulated by our beloved great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's call to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end" reached Lankao like a spring thunder. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lankao heard the warm call of their most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and immediately boiled over! They said: Chairman Mao said to mobilize the masses and let the masses educate themselves in the movement. Chairman Mao wants us to care about state affairs. We will definitely rise up and do it!

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the four model brigades personally established by Comrade Jiao Yulu were the first to rise up and form a "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Guards Jiao Rebel Command." The poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire county responded unanimously, and everyone rose up. Immediately, the workers in the county city organized a "Workers Guards Jiao Rebel Command," the county direct organs formed the "Guards Jiao Combat Corps," and the students of the Second Middle School formed the "August 18th Jiao Yulu Combat Team." The revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres of the entire county had one viewpoint and one heart: firmly support Comrade Jiao Yulu and Comrade Zhang Qingli. As they said, 380,000 people of Lankao, the vast majority are Guards Jiao fighters. They stood firm, clearly distinguished between friends and enemies, and dared to rebel and support. Just as Chairman Mao taught us: "The eyes of the peasants are never wrong. Who is bad, who is not bad... the peasants have a very clear calculation..." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao understood from their own experience: Comrade Jiao Yulu and Comrade Zhang Qingli were the ones who raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, who wholeheartedly wanted to lead the 380,000 people of Lankao to walk the bright road of socialism. Wang X and Zhou X were not well-intentioned. If we followed them, it would be like walking the road to death of capitalism and jumping into the abyss. Therefore, supporting Zhang Qingli was to support Comrade Jiao Yulu, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to defend our socialist state. They clearly put forward: "Zhou X is the number one capitalist roader in the county committee," "Zhang Qingli is a revolutionary leading cadre," "Firmly overthrow Zhou X," "Firmly support Zhang Qingli." This was their action slogan.

In January 1967, under the influence and inspiration of the "January Storm" in Shanghai, 66 revolutionary organizations in Lankao united to form a vast revolutionary army and seized power from a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee and the county people's committee. In this good revolutionary situation, the class enemies were disheartened, and the revolutionary people were elated.

However, as Chairman Mao said: "The day the people are happy is the day the counter-revolutionaries are miserable." The small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee who fled to Kaifeng were not willing to accept their defeat. They still wanted to make a final struggle. Not long after the seizure of power in January, they hurriedly colluded with a small clique of capitalist roaders within the prefectural and provincial committees and collaborated with a reactionary tide in society. On a night, they "killed" their way back to Lankao, arresting and suppressing the unarmed Guards Jiao fighters. They arrested and imprisoned in batches the old poor peasants, Party and Youth League activists, and strong revolutionary leading cadres who raised the banner of "rebellion is justified." Comrade Zhang Qingli, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Jiao Yulu, was labeled a "current counter-revolutionary." They seized the county radio station and broadcast Zhang Qingli's "eight crimes" all day long...

The four model brigades of Han Village, Qin Village, Zhao Doupolo, and Shuangyang Tree were labeled "revisionist brigades" and "stubborn brigades." The Sanyi Village Commune, not far from the city, was divided by the capitalist roaders within the old county committee into "liberated areas," "guerrilla areas," and "enemy-occupied areas" based on different viewpoints. They also carried out a so-called confession movement throughout the county.

Not only that, they also used the despicable methods of counter-revolutionary economism to force commune members to change their viewpoints. Those who believed in their viewpoints and agreed to overthrow Zhang Qingli were given relief grain, relief money, and radishes. They also gathered all the ghosts and demons from society, as well as speculators, idlers, and lazy people, to shout slogans for them and boost their morale.

Dark clouds hung over Lankao. The decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the land of Lankao had arrived! A more magnificent and profound class struggle began!

Firmly Defend Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line with Loyalty

In this struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao were truly heroes. No matter how treacherous the waves were, they always remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong." They firmly believed that Chairman Mao would definitely support the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao. Whoever directed the spearhead at the poor and lower-middle peasants was definitely not a person on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; he was a person on the black line represented by Liu Shaoqi. In the most difficult days, under the layer upon layer of blockade by the reactionary line, they could not hear the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They gathered around small oil lamps in the dead of night, studying and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again. The confidants of the capitalist roaders wanted them to change their viewpoints, but they replied firmly: No! We poor and lower-middle peasants have only one heart, we will defend Chairman Mao to the death! We will defend Comrade Jiao Yulu's banner to the death! We firmly support Zhang Qingli! You say Zhang Qingli is a "black gang member," we are willing to be "black gang members." The confidants of the capitalist roaders said: "Change your viewpoint, and I will give you radishes!" The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "We can do without radishes, but changing our viewpoint is as difficult as climbing to the sky."

In the most difficult days, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao, in their life-and-death struggle against the reactionary line, created countless moving heroic deeds!

The fifth production team of Nanmazhuang Brigade in Sanyi Village Commune was a model advanced unit personally established by Comrade Jiao Yulu—"the Hard-Boned Production Team." The team leader, Zhang Yingtang, was a good cadre who loved the collective and worked for the public good. Since every household in this team had the viewpoint of guarding Jiao, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee naturally saw it as a thorn in their eye and labeled this place as an "enemy-occupied area." The confidants of the capitalist roaders, carrying sticks and ropes, came to arrest people day and night. The commune members all advised team leader Zhang Yingtang to hide. But the production team was his livelihood, his lifeline. How could he leave? In the old society, Zhang Yingtang's family was a destitute household. They had no house, no land. The family lived in a dilapidated temple for decades, begged for food for decades... In countless bitterness meetings, he shed hot tears and could not speak. But today, in the storm of class struggle, in the days of white terror, he sat in the office of the production team like an iron man, unyielding, saying: "No! I cannot leave everyone. Who will manage the production of our team if I leave?" This image of a team leader from a poor peasant family was not the image of thousands of grassroots cadres in Lankao County?

There was an old woman named Zhou Yuhua in Shuangyang Tree Brigade. In the dark old society, her father was forced to death by the landlord, her mother starved to death, and her brother was shot by the Japanese. The family was left with only her. After liberation, she finally turned over a new leaf and lived a sweet life, having eight children. She told everyone: "I will never forget Chairman Mao."

This time, during the Cultural Revolution, she heard that there were capitalist roaders in the county, not on the same wavelength with Chairman Mao, and wanted to restore capitalism. Old grievances and new hatred surged up in her heart. She said: "I have tasted the bitterness of capitalism, I cannot walk that road again, I want to walk the bright road of socialism. Whoever is not on the same wavelength with Chairman Mao, I will definitely rebel against him!" Thus, she joined the "Lankao Guards Jiao" and became a staunch Guards Jiao fighter. She never expected that just as the Cultural Revolution in the county was about to win, the capitalist roaders of the county committee returned to stir up trouble. The radio broadcast Zhang Qingli's "eight crimes" every day, saying that Kaifeng's "August 24th" was a "bastard organization" and "Lankao Guards Jiao" was counter-revolutionary. She heard this and cut the line, her heart aching like a knife. She heard that Kaifeng's "August 24th" was surrounded by conservatives for a few days. She couldn't help but shiver, wanting to go to Kaifeng to see. Someone asked her: "Do you have anyone in August 24th?" She said: "No, I have no sons, no daughters. It's Chairman Mao who told me to care about state affairs. They are all Chairman Mao's good children, how can I not care about them?"

In the most difficult days, Grandma Zhou Yuhua couldn't eat or sleep. Whenever she had time, she sat in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Do you know what's happening in Lankao?" Her daughter advised her: "Mom, that's a portrait of Chairman Mao, he can't hear you. Hurry up and eat something!" Grandma Zhou Yuhua said: "No! Chairman Mao is in our home. Whatever is in our hearts, we must say it to him. With Chairman Mao as the master, we are not afraid of anything."

Grandma Zhou Yuhua was already fifty years old, and she had a four or five-year-old child at home. However, she ran twenty to thirty miles every night to make connections. As soon as she saw her own people, she first recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in difficult times, raise our courage." She used Chairman Mao's words to inspire the young poor and lower-middle peasants to fight.

The confidants of the capitalist roaders hated and feared Grandma Zhou so much that as soon as they saw her, they sneered at her, ridiculed her, and cursed her as an "old diehard," a "staunch royalist of Zhang Qingli," saying she was "too deeply deceived!" Grandma Zhou Yuhua also retorted without yielding an inch: "I am deceived two zhang deep, you deal with it! Chairman Mao has armed my mind, it is an iron wall, no one can break it!" Seeing that words didn't work, the confidants of the capitalist roaders resorted to violence. They beat Grandma Zhou's eyes so swollen that she couldn't see. But Grandma Zhou's family would not yield. Her husband stood at the door and shouted: "Beat us! Our whole family has the viewpoint of 'August 24th'!" Grandma Zhou also said: "I am not afraid of revolution, afraid of revolution is not revolutionary! I will hold up Chairman Mao's red banner high and let it fly forever!"

In Xiaosong Commune, Tangzhuang Brigade had an old man named Yan Xiecheng. He was the deputy chairman of the county poor peasants' association, a representative to the provincial poor and lower-middle peasants' representative conference, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. He had a weather-beaten, kind face. The cotton hat on his head was patched and mended many times, and he had worn it for many years without wanting to change it. In Lankao County, people affectionately called him "Representative Yan," saying, "Representative Yan is selfless and benefits others, Chairman Mao's thoughts are in his heart." Usually, when he heard that the U.S. imperialists were bombing Vietnam, he educated his children to eat vegetables mixed with grain, saving 200 catties of wheat to support the Vietnamese brothers. He also saved more than 100 catties of coarse grain, which was specially for the five guarantees households.

This time, during the Cultural Revolution, Yan Xiecheng took the lead in rebelling, and together with young female Communist Party member Yang Suilan from Han Village and others, organized the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Guards Jiao Rebel Command," firmly defending Comrade Jiao Yulu's banner and firmly supporting Zhang Qingli. He was determined: Zhou X was a capitalist roader, Zhang Qingli was a good cadre. Bad people must be criticized, good people must be supported.

Just such a respectable old man, in the days of white terror, was labeled by the capitalist roaders of the county and prefectural committees and their confidants as Zhang Qingli's "filial son and grandson." The east and west streets and the north and south streets of the village were all surrounded by big-character posters attacking him. Even his eight-month-old child was labeled a "little counter-revolutionary lamb." His family, which was originally "all red," became "all black" at that time. The children dared not go to school or herd sheep. The sheep all starved to death. Old Man Yan was also "debated" (struggled against) dozens of times by the confidants of the capitalist roaders in the commune and brigade.

Under such tremendous pressure, Old Man Yan's heart to defend Chairman Mao never changed. He said: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is my lifeline, it is more important to defend Chairman Mao!" At night, he led his family to swear in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Happiness is given by Chairman Mao. I will defend Chairman Mao's state forever." Every "debate," Old Man Yan sang the song "The East Is Red" and recited Chairman Mao's quotation, "With determination, without fear of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and went to the field to dig wells. He said: "Chairman Mao wants me to seize the revolution and promote production. I want to achieve double victories in revolution and production!"

In those difficult days, at the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, what about the children of Lankao? They were so enthusiastic, brave, and clever. It can be said without exaggeration: they were all little heroes. They were worthy of being children of the Mao Zedong era, worthy of being good descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In Lankao, the story of children driving away Liu Shaoqi's "work team" spread everywhere. Now, on the walls of Han Village, you can still see the big slogans written by the children against Liu Shaoqi's work team. What happened? Originally, in Han Village Brigade, Han Village Production Team, except for one household, all had the viewpoint of guarding Jiao. The capitalist roaders within the county and prefectural committees sent a "work team" of 32 people to 29 households to force this production team to change its viewpoint. As soon as they entered the door, they said: "You have been deceived! Zhang Qingli is a current counter-revolutionary!" The adults and children of Han Village knew that Comrade Jiao was a good person, and Comrade Zhang was also a good person! Hearing the propaganda of the "work team," they were furious. Especially those fearless children, they shouted at the "work team": "What kind of work team are you? You are Liu Shaoqi's work team. Get out quickly!" Later, they simply did not provide food for the "work team." Whenever it was time for the "work team" to eat, they surrounded them and said: "I am on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, you are on Liu Shaoqi's line, we are not on the same viewpoint, you cannot eat our food." Some said: "You say Zhang Qingli is a 'black gang,' I am a 'black gang member,' my food is also 'black,' you cannot eat it!" They put steamed buns on the table, and the children took the buns away. They put rice on the table, and the children poured the rice back into the pot. The "work team" was so unpopular in Han Village that they finally had to leave in disgrace and never came back.

In the struggle against the reactionary line, many children organized themselves to help the adults stand guard and keep watch. They were both fighters and propagandists. Without pens and paper, they used sickles to carve big-character slogans on the field edges and roads: "Overthrow Zhou X!" "Firmly support Zhang Qingli!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

This struggle between light and darkness lasted for more than five months. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the county and prefectural committees and their confidants had already fallen deeply into the vast ocean of the heroic people of Lankao!

In July 1967, the sun was scorching. Under the warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the entire Henan Province began to present a great situation. The proletarian revolutionaries of Henan—"August 7th Commune" and Kaifeng's "August 24th"—had achieved decisive victories in the struggle. The central leaders received Comrade Zhang Qingli, a revolutionary leading cadre of Lankao, and representatives of "Lankao Guards Jiao" in Beijing. The good news spread, and the entire county boiled over. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line won! The revolutionary people won! The poor and lower-middle peasants of each commune spontaneously surged into the county city. From Lankao Station to the tomb of Comrade Jiao Yulu on the ancient dike of the Yellow River, it was a sea of people. People held up the battle flags of "Lankao Guards Jiao," drums and gongs resounded, and firecrackers exploded. The heartfelt shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!" shook the heavens and the earth. To celebrate the victory, the tea stalls on both sides of the street did not charge money. Only those who participated in the struggle could truly feel: this was the happiest moment of their lives.

Heroic Lankao people! Fighting Lankao people! They did not become intoxicated with victory and did not stop their advancing steps. Under the leadership of the newly born Lankao County Revolutionary Committee, they raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, took "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply carried out revolutionary big-character posters and struggle-criticism-transformation within their units, supported the army and loved the people, seized the revolution, promoted production, promoted work, and promoted preparedness. They were determined to do a better job in all aspects in the new year of 1968.

Heroic Lankao people! Fighting Lankao people! They are striding forward in the footsteps of Comrade Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student, to build a new Lankao that shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    兰考人民战斗的新篇章
    ——记兰考县农村无产阶级文化大革命两条路线的斗争
    振奋人心的革命景象
    在毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志工作和战斗过的地方——河南省兰考县，经过史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼，呈现一派大好形势。
    一年多来，在这片英雄的土地上，经历了一场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的惊心动魄的大搏斗。全县广大贫下中农坚决地要保执行毛主席革命路线的焦裕禄这面旗子；旧县委内一小撮走资派和他们所操纵的一部分顽固保守势力，则千方百计地要砍掉这面旗子。阶级阵线从来没有这样分明；阶级斗争从来没有这样激烈。如今，兰考的无产阶级革命派——全县最大的贫下中农革命组织“兰考卫焦”，已经在这场斗争中取得了决定性的胜利。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是这样深入人心，光芒四射。中国赫鲁晓夫伸进兰考的黑线，早已象瘟神一样被千万人所唾弃。旧县委内一小撮走资派，成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。以焦裕禄同志生前的亲密战友张钦礼同志为首的兰考县革命委员会，已在革命的急风暴雨中光荣地诞生。
    踏上英雄的兰考大地，一幅欣欣向荣的革命景象，会立刻把你紧紧地吸引住。走进每一个大小村镇，许多男女社员，甚至白发苍苍的老人，都佩戴着鲜红的“兰考卫焦”的胸章。他们一见面就亲切地向你打招呼，一开口就以无限崇敬的心情赞颂我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席。
    在这里，毛泽东思想学习班，象雨后春笋般地遍及每一个公社和生产队。
    在这里，不论是大街小巷，是生产队的办公室，还是挖河工地上，揭露中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”罪行的革命大批判专栏，到处可见。
    目前，正是严冬季节。大地冰冻，北风怒吼。然而，广大贫下中农正在以从文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，投入热火朝天的冬季生产运动。一队队男女社员，手捧着毛主席像，携带着毛主席语录牌，打着红旗，唱着革命歌曲，象一队队英武的战士，步伐整齐地走向田野。在那平坦的土地上，人们正在以愚公移山的精神，摇动“铁臂”，挥舞“银锄”，开河挖渠……，以便用黄河的水，把多年的盐碱地，改造为肥沃的稻田。在那一堆堆沙丘上，人们正在大种广种泡桐树，以便让兰考全县换上新装。辽阔的兰考大地，红旗招展，人群踊跃，歌声嘹亮。
    英雄的兰考人民，正在以百倍的信心和勇气，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利；正在以英雄式的劳动，续写着焦裕禄同志没有写完的瑰丽的文章。
  阶级斗争走着曲折的道路
    兰考的大好形势并不是从天上掉下来的，也不是一阵什么大风吹来的，而是兰考县广大贫下中农和革命干部，凭着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，经过艰苦卓绝的斗争得来的。
    兰考县的阶级斗争，走过了一段曲折的道路。
    在一九六二年以前，县委第一书记王××，正是中国赫鲁晓夫在兰考县的一个忠实门徒。他一来到兰考，就对这块连年受灾的地方看不惯。他不是领导全县人民向自然灾害作斗争，而是带着棕床、藤椅到土质最好的丰产区去“蹲点”。在三年经济困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫乘机抛出了“三自一包”的黑纲领。王××如获至宝，得意忘形地称赞“三自一包”是什么“救命政策”，“活命政策”，“拴人政策”（防止灾民外流）。他不顾广大贫下中农和基层干部的反对，在城关公社大搞“三自一包”的试点，大吹大擂地推销他的“土地包产到户，牲口分槽喂养”的黑货。当时，全县以“借地”、“开荒”为名被变相侵占的土地占全部集体耕地面积的百分之三十三点二。城关公社胡集大队，除了种公粮的土地以外，百分之九十七的集体耕地被分配到户。
    随着资本主义势力的复活，阶级敌人也蠢蠢欲动。他们到处煽动社员搞单干，猖狂地破坏集体经济。树木被砍伐了，水利系统遭到了破坏。整个兰考灾区盐碱上升，内涝加剧，土地荒芜，风沙重起。严重的自然灾害，又降临到全县三十八万人民的头上。
    就在这个重要的时刻——一九六二年十二月，毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志，受了党的委托，带着金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》和党的八届十中全会的精神，来到了兰考县。
    焦裕禄同志不愧为毛主席的好学生。他到兰考后的第一件事，就是“举旗抓纲”——高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大抓狠抓阶级斗争这条纲。他在灾难深重的兰考县广泛开展了忆苦思甜教育，调动和激发了全县贫下中农的社会主义积极性，狠狠打击了阶级敌人复辟资本主义的活动，大长了贫下中农的志气，大灭了资本主义势力的威风。他怀着强烈的阶级感情走进生产队的牛棚和贫下中农的家屋，大力表彰贫下中农中涌现出来的自力更生和奋发图强的新事物，热情地支持贫下中农走社会主义道路的坚强意志和决心。他在全县亲自树立了四个红旗大队，这就是：韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，赵垛楼的干劲，双杨树的道路。进一步激发了全县贫下中农冲天的革命干劲和革命硬骨头精神，向自然灾害进行了可歌可泣的英勇斗争。经过三年的奋战，基本上锁住了风沙，制服了洪水，改造了盐碱。连年受灾的兰考第一次获得了好收成。
    兰考人民饮水思源，有口皆碑。他们对毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志永远感念不忘。他们说：“毛主席咋说，焦书记咋做，句句话说在俺心窝里，件件事办得俺心满意足，真是俺贫下中农的贴心人。”
    焦裕禄同志逝世以后，焦裕禄同志生前的亲密战友、县委副书记张钦礼同志，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，继续踏着焦裕禄的脚印前进。他进的是贫下中农的门，吃的是贫下中农的饭，和贫下中农在一起战天斗地，为建设一个更加美好的社会主义的新兰考，作出了自己的贡献。
    然而，兰考县的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，并没有就此结束。
    焦裕禄同志逝世以后，又来了一个县委书记，名叫周××。这个人和贫下中农根本不是一个心眼。他一来到兰考，就要把林彪副主席亲笔题词表彰的毛主席的好学生焦裕禄这面红旗砍倒。在他看来：“兰考县的灾害还没有减轻，沙荒还没有盖好，精神还没有变成物质。”他竟然说：“宣传出去，叫全国来看什么？看沙荒和盐碱吗？”
    焦裕禄同志的模范事迹广泛宣传以后，全国亿万人民被深深地感动了。每天到兰考参观访问的人络绎不绝。人们要求周××介绍焦裕禄同志的事迹，周××却冷冷地说：“我刚来，不了解情况，叫张钦礼介绍吧！”张钦礼同志介绍了，周××又怀恨在心，到处污蔑张钦礼同志“宣传焦裕禄事迹，是想捞政治资本”。一个要宣传焦裕禄，一个要否定焦裕禄。兰考县两条路线的斗争又一天天激化起来。
  贫农、下中农英勇地投入
      文化大革命的洪流
    一九六六年六月，毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火熊熊地燃烧起来。在兰考，文化大革命一开始，旧县委内以周××为首的一小撮走资派，就来了个恶人先告状。他们蒙蔽了一部分群众，转移了斗争大方向，把矛头直接指向了焦裕禄同志生前的亲密战友张钦礼同志。
      “张钦礼是政治扒手！”
      “张钦礼是三反分子！”
    一时间阴风四起，妖雾迷漫。千百张莫须有的大字报劈头盖脸地朝张钦礼同志打来。
      “这是怎么回事？”
    “张书记宣传焦裕禄同志的事迹难道错了吗？”
    “县委内一些人为啥要砍焦书记这面旗子？为啥要把焦书记生前的亲密战友打成三反分子？”
    一连串的问题，使兰考的广大贫下中农再也不能沉默了。
    兰考的贫下中农是苦大仇深的，是有高度社会主义觉悟的。在旧社会不知有多少人逃荒，要饭，卖儿卖女……。他们永远不能忘记：是毛主席把他们从火坑里救了出来，过上了今天的甜日子。他们永远不能忘记，焦裕禄同志正是打着毛主席的红旗进兰考的。他为兰考三十八万人民献出了自己的生命。焦裕禄同志和张钦礼同志都是毛主席司令部的人，他们和贫下中农是一根藤上的瓜。只有王××、周××等人才和贫下中农不一个心眼。本来周××是接焦裕禄同志的班的，可是他来兰考两年，没有交一个贫下中农的朋友。他们反对张钦礼，是企图借反对张钦礼来反对焦裕禄，反对贫下中农，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们想从贫下中农的心窝里砍掉焦裕禄这面鲜艳的红旗是万万办不到的。
    正因为这样，兰考的贫下中农十分关心这场文化大革命。他们白天坚持生产，夜晚就积极闹革命，谁反对张钦礼，谁贴张钦礼的大字报，他们就和谁辩论。
    就在这时候，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》（即十六条）和毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，象一声春雷传到了兰考。兰考县的广大贫下中农，听到了最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切召唤，立刻沸腾起来了！他们说：毛主席说的要放手发动群众，要让群众在运动中自己教育自己，毛主席要我们关心国家大事，我们尽管起来干！
    焦裕禄同志亲自树立起来的四个红旗大队的贫下中农首先起来串连，成立了一个“贫下中农卫焦造反司令部”，全县贫下中农一呼百应，呼啦啦都起来了。紧接着，县城的工人组织了一个“工人卫焦造反司令部”，县直机关成立了“卫焦战斗兵团”，二中的学生组成了“八一八裕禄战斗队”。全县革命的工人、农民、学生和机关干部一个观点，一个心眼：坚决地保焦裕禄，保张钦礼。按照他们的话说，三十八万兰考人民，绝大多数都是卫焦战士。他们立场坚定，爱憎分明，敢革敢保。正如毛主席所教导我们的：“农民的眼睛，全然没有错的。谁个劣，谁个不劣，……农民都有极明白的计算，……”。兰考的贫下中农，从切身体会中懂得：焦裕禄和张钦礼同志是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的，是一心一意要带领兰考三十八万人民走社会主义的光明大道的。王××、周××却安的不是好心。依了他们，就等于向资本主义死路上走，向火坑里跳。因此，保张钦礼，就是为了保焦裕禄，就是为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，就是为了保卫我们的社会主义江山。他们毫不含糊地提出：“周××是县委内头号走资派”，“张钦礼是革命领导干部”，“坚决打倒周××”，“坚决支持张钦礼”。这就是他们的行动口号。
    一九六七年一月，兰考贫下中农在上海“一月风暴”的影响和鼓舞下，六十六个革命组织联合起来，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，一举夺了旧县委、县人委内一小撮走资派的权。在这大好的革命形势下，阶级敌人丧魂落魄，革命人民扬眉吐气。
    但是，正如毛主席所说的：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”逃到开封的旧县委内一小撮走资派不甘心他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。一月夺权不久，他们就急急忙忙勾结地委、省委内一小撮走资派，配合社会上的一股反动逆流，在一天的夜里，重新“杀”回了兰考，对手无寸铁的卫焦战士，来了个大逮捕，大镇压。他们把高举造反有理大旗的老贫农、党团员积极分子和坚强的革命领导干部，成批地逮捕入狱。焦裕禄同志的亲密战友张钦礼同志被宣布为“现行反革命分子”。他们把县广播站夺在自己手里，一天到晚播送张钦礼的“八大罪状”。……
    韩村、秦寨、赵垛楼和双杨树四个红旗大队，被打成“修正主义大队”和“顽固大队”。离城不远的三义寨公社，被旧县委内的走资派依观点的不同划为“解放区”、“游击区”和“敌占区”。他们还在全县大搞所谓请罪运动。
    不仅如此，他们还采用反革命经济主义的卑劣手法，强迫社员改变观点。凡是信了他们的观点的，凡是赞成打倒张钦礼的，他们就发给救济粮、救济款，发给萝卜。他们还把社会上的一些牛鬼蛇神，以及投机倒把、好吃懒做的人，统统搜罗起来，为他们摇旗呐喊，以壮声威。
    兰考上空笼罩着乌云。兰考大地上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻到来了！一场在广度和深度上更加波澜壮阔的阶级斗争开始了！赤胆忠心保卫毛主席革命路线
    在这场斗争中，兰考的贫下中农不愧为英雄好汉。不管风浪多么险恶，他们永远记着毛主席的话：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。”他们坚信：毛主席是一定会替兰考的贫下中农撑腰的。谁要是把矛头指向贫下中农，他就肯定不是毛主席革命路线上的人，他就是中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的黑线上的人。在最困难的日子里，在反动路线的层层封锁下，听不到毛主席和党中央的声音。他们就在深更半夜，围坐在小油灯下，一遍又一遍地学习和背诵毛主席语录。走资派的亲信们要他们改变观点，他们斩钉截铁地回答：不！俺们贫下中农只有一个心，誓死保卫毛主席！誓死保卫焦书记这面红旗！坚决支持张钦礼！你说张钦礼是个“黑帮分子”，俺们情愿作“黑帮社员”。走资派的亲信说：“改变观点，我给你萝卜！”贫下中农说：“萝卜可以不吃，想叫俺改变观点比登天还难。”
    在最困难的日子里，兰考的贫下中农，在和反动路线的殊死斗争中，创造了多少可歌可泣的英雄事迹啊！
    三义寨公社南马庄大队有一个第五生产队，是焦裕禄同志生前亲自树立的一个先进典型——“硬骨头生产队”。队长张应堂，是一个热爱集体、一心为公的好干部。由于这个队没有一户不是“卫焦”观点，旧县委内一小撮走资派自然把它看成眼中钉，并把这个地方划成了“敌占区”。走资派的亲信，掂着棍子，拿着绳子，整天?二喝三要来抓人。社员们都劝队长张应堂出去躲一躲。可是，生产队就是他的家业，他的命根子。他怎么能够离开呢？！在旧社会，张应堂一家是一个赤贫户。房无一间，地无一垄。一家人住了几十年的破庙，要了几十年的饭。……在多少次忆苦会上，他都热泪横流，泣不成声。可是今天，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，在白色恐怖的日子里，他却象一座金刚一样坐在生产队的办公室里，坚强不屈地说：“不！我不能离开大家。我走了，咱队的生产谁管呀！”这个贫农出身的生产队长的形象，不正是兰考县千百个农村基层干部的形象吗？
    双杨树大队有个大娘叫周玉花。在黑暗的旧社会，她父亲被地主逼死了，母亲饿死了，哥哥被日本人枪杀了。一家人就剩了她一口子。解放后她才翻了身，过上了甜美的日子，有了八个孩子。她逢人就说：“我永世不忘毛主席。”
    这次文化大革命，她听说县里出了走资派，跟毛主席不一个心，要复辟资本主义。旧恨新仇一齐涌上心头。她说：“资本主义那条路我是吃过苦头的，不能再走了，我要走社会主义的光明大道。谁不跟毛主席一个心，俺就坚决造他的反！”就这样，她参加了“兰考卫焦”，成了一名坚强的卫焦战士。她万万没有想到，眼看县里的文化大革命就要胜利的时候，县委的走资派又回来兴风作浪。广播匣子里天天播送张钦礼的“八大罪状”，胡说什么开封“八·二四是混蛋组织”，“兰考卫焦是反革命”。她一听就把线卡了，心里象刀绞一样难受。
    有几天听说开封“八·二四”被保守派包围了。她禁不住打了个寒战，一心想到开封去看看。有人问她：“八·二四有你的啥人？”她说：“没有我的儿，也没有我的女。是毛主席叫我关心国家大事。他们都是毛主席的好孩子，我能不惦记他们吗？”
    在最困难的日子里，周玉花大娘吃不下饭，也睡不着觉。她一有空就坐在毛主席像前，对毛主席说：“毛主席呀，毛主席！俺兰考的事，您老人家知道不知道？”她闺女劝她说：“妈！那是毛主席像，你说了他老人家也听不见。快吃点饭吧！”周玉花说：“不！毛主席就在咱家里。心里有啥话，就得给他老人家说。有毛主席作主，俺啥也不怕。”
    周玉花大娘已经五十岁了，身边还有个四五岁的孩子。可是，她每天夜里都跑二三十里地出去串连。一见到自己的人，她就先背诵毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”她就是用毛主席的话去鼓舞贫下中农的后生们起来战斗。
    走资派的亲信们对周大娘恨得要死，也怕得要死。一见面就讽刺她，挖苦她，骂她是“老顽固”，是“张钦礼的铁杆保皇派”，说她“受蒙蔽太深啦！”周玉花大娘也分毫不让地说：“俺受‘蒙蔽’有两丈深，你看着办吧！毛主席武装我的头脑，是铜墙铁壁，谁也打不开！”走资派的亲信们看文的不行，就来武的。他们把周大娘的眼睛都打肿了。可是周大娘一家那里肯服？她的老伴站在大门口高喊：“打吧！俺全家都是‘八·二四’观点！”周大娘也说：“俺革命不怕死！怕死不革命！俺还要把毛主席的红旗举得高高的，叫它永远飘扬！”
    小宋公社唐寨大队有一个阎协崇大爷。他是县贫协的副主任，出席省贫下中农代表会的代表，也是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他有一张饱经风霜的慈祥的脸。头上的一顶棉帽，补了又补，缀了又缀，已经戴了多年了，还不舍得换一换。在兰考县，人们都亲切地称他“阎代表”，说“阎代表毫不利己，专门利人，毛主席思想学到心里去了。”平日，听说美帝国主义轰炸越南，他就教育儿女们，用瓜菜掺着粮食吃，省出了二百斤小麦，留着支援越南兄弟。还节省了百多斤粗粮，是专门补助五保户的。
    这次文化大革命，阎协崇带头起来造反，和韩村年青的女共产党员杨素兰等人一起组织了“贫下中农卫焦造反司令部”，坚决保焦裕禄这面红旗，坚决保张钦礼。他认定：周××是走资派，张钦礼是好干部。坏人就是要揪，好人就是要保。
    就是这样一个可敬爱的老人，在那白色恐怖的日子里，却被地、县委的走资派和他们的亲信打成了张钦礼的“孝子贤孙”。村子的东西街和南北街，全是围攻他的大字报。连他的一个刚满八个月的孩子，也被贴了大字报，骂成是“小反革命羔”。他家本来是“满家红”，当时却成了“满家黑”。孩子们不敢去上学，不敢去放羊。羊都饿死了。阎大爷本人，也被走资派的亲信们在公社和大队“辩论”（斗争）了几十次。
    就是这样千斤的压力，阎协崇大爷保卫毛主席的一颗红心永远不变。他说：“毛主席的革命路线是俺的命根子，还是保卫毛主席要紧！”夜里，他带领全家在毛主席像前宣誓：“幸福是毛主席给的。俺要保卫毛主席江山万万年。”
    每一次“辩论”会，阎协崇大爷都当成了忆苦会。他讲自己在旧社会是怎样的吃苦受罪。腊月天，下着大雪，他怎样在冻得红肿的双脚上绑点破布片就去要饭。他讲毛主席怎样把他从火坑里救出来，又怎样过上了今天的幸福生活。他说：“我永生永世也不能忘了毛主席。你们想想，贫下中农听毛主席的话起来闹革命有什么罪？你们为啥听信坏人的话，把矛头对准咱贫下中农？！”他的话把那些一时受蒙蔽的群众感动得痛哭流涕！
    阎协崇大爷越斗争，精神越旺盛。一天“辩论”他三次，他照样唱着《东方红》的歌子，背诵着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录，下地去打井。他说：“毛主席要我抓革命促生产。我要争取革命、生产双胜利！”
    在那些困难的日子，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，兰考的孩子们又是怎样的呢？他们是那样热情、勇敢、机智。可以毫不夸张地说：他们一个个都是小英雄。他们不愧为毛泽东时代的儿童，不愧为贫下中农的好后代。
    在兰考到处流传着孩子们赶走中国赫鲁晓夫“工作组”的故事。如今，在韩村的墙壁上，仍然可以看到孩子们写的反对中国赫鲁晓夫工作组的大标语。这是怎么回事呢？原来，韩村大队韩村生产队除了一户以外，全都是一个观点——卫焦观点。地、县委内的走资派为了胁迫这个生产队改变观点，二十九户人家就派来了三十二人的
  “工作组”。他们一进门，开口就是：“你们受蒙蔽了！张钦礼是现行反革命分子！”韩村的大人小孩谁不知道焦书记是好人，张书记也是好人！听了“工作组”的宣传，他们心里火透了。尤其是那些天不怕、地不怕的孩子们，他们尖着嗓子质问“工作组”：“你们是啥工作组？是中国赫鲁晓夫的工作组。快走开！”后来，他们就干脆不给“工作组”开饭。一到“工作组”吃饭的时候，他们就围上去说：“俺是毛主席的革命路线，你是中国赫鲁晓夫的路线，咱们不一个观点，不能吃俺们的饭。”有的说：“你说张钦礼是‘黑帮’，俺就是‘黑帮社员’，俺的饭也是‘黑’的，你不能吃！”桌上放上馍，孩子们把馍拿走，桌上摆上饭，孩子们把饭倒回锅里。“工作组”在韩村实在不得人心，最后，不得不灰溜溜地回到县城，再也不来了。
    在和反动路线针锋相对的斗争中，很多孩子都自动组织起来，帮助大人站岗，放哨。他们既是战斗员，又是宣传员。没有笔和纸，他们就用镰刀在场边和大路上到处刻写大字标语：“打倒周××！”“坚决支持张钦礼！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    这场光明和黑暗的决斗，整整持续了五个多月。地、县委内一小撮走资派和他们的亲信们，已经深深地陷落在英雄的兰考人民的汪洋大海般的包围之中了！
    一九六七年七月，骄阳似火。在毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀下，整个河南开始呈现了一派大好形势。河南的无产阶级革命派——“二七公社”和开封“八·二四”已在斗争中取得了决定性的胜利。中央首长在北京接见了兰考的革命领导干部张钦礼同志和“兰考卫焦”的代表。喜讯传来，全县沸腾。毛主席的革命路线胜利了！革命人民胜利了！各个公社的贫下中农们自动涌进了县城。从兰考车站到座落在黄河古堤上的焦裕禄同志的墓前，人山人海。人们高举着“兰考卫焦”的战旗，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣。人们发自肺腑的“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，震天动地。为了欢庆胜利，大街两旁的茶水摊也不要钱了。只有亲身参加斗争的人，才能真正体会到：这是他们一生中最愉快的时刻。
    英雄的兰考人民！战斗的兰考人民！他们并没有因胜利而陶醉，并没有停止前进的脚步。他们正在新生的兰考县革命委员会的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，拥军爱民，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，决心在新的一九六八年，把各方面工作做得更好。
    英雄的兰考人民！战斗的兰考人民！正在踏着毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志的脚印，为建设一个闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的社会主义的新兰考而奋勇前进！
