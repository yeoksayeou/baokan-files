Mao Zedong's latest instructions have been grasped by the masses and transformed into a powerful material force. The wave of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in Hubei is surging and surging.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 18: In the high tide of studying, applying, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in Hubei have merged into a mighty torrent, like countless rivers flowing into the Yangtze River, breaking waves forward, unstoppable.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions, this strongest east wind, has blown Hubei hot and steaming, with good news coming in one after another. From cities to rural areas, from mountainous regions to plains, reports of achieving revolutionary great alliance come one after another; news of establishing revolutionary committees follows one after another. So far, in the heroic city of Wuhan, revolutionary great alliance has basically been achieved. Most of the prefectures, cities, and counties in the province have also achieved revolutionary great alliance. A large number of prefectures, cities, and counties, as well as factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and offices, have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory committees.

The working class, which does not seek personal gain, does not seek fame, works hard, and is the most thorough in revolution, takes the lead and sets an example; revolutionary masses from all fronts rise up and follow closely; the work in grassroots units is solid and steady, step by step, with a solid foundation, and naturally successful. This is the most prominent feature of the revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in Hubei. The working class of Wuhan, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, uses Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, and with the support and help of the Wuhan units of the People's Liberation Army, has pioneered the experience of insisting on the "three relationships," grasping the "three starting points," and achieving "three mutual promotions" in the process of revolutionary great alliance. They have correctly handled the relationship between the city-wide revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary great alliance within the factory, workshop, and team; they have started from the revolutionary great alliance at the grassroots level, promoted from the bottom up, combined the upper and lower levels, and promoted each other; they have correctly handled the relationship between organizational realization of the revolutionary great alliance and ideological realization and consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance; they have started from the ideological revolutionary great alliance, led actions with thoughts, ensured consistency between words and deeds, combined learning with application, and promoted each other; they have correctly handled the relationship between ideological great alliance and criticizing and repudiating revisionism; they have started from eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, applied what they learned immediately, seen results quickly, combined solving specific problems with changing worldviews, and promoted each other. Their solid and exemplary actions have not only made more than 90% of the factories and mines in the city achieve revolutionary great alliance by factory, workshop, and team, but also promoted the emergence of a new situation of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination on all fronts in the city.

The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the Cultural Revolution. The new upsurge of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in Hubei is precisely because the broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in various places have regarded the realization, development, and consolidation of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination as an important step in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as a crucial battle in seizing the full victory of the Cultural Revolution, and as a severe test of whether they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many factories, people's communes, schools, and offices have, while repeatedly studying the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, seriously summarized the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution over the past more than a year, and have more deeply realized that only by achieving, consolidating, and developing the revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be fully implemented, the five battle tasks for 1968 be guaranteed, and the full victory of the Cultural Revolution be ensured. Chairman Mao's latest instructions grasped by the broad revolutionary masses have become an invincible great material force, creating a new situation of revolutionary great leap forward.

With the help of the supporting-left troops, the two factions jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the heads of various revolutionary organizations studying together, turning the study classes into models of promoting revolutionary learning style and into red bastions of overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Grasping the ideological transformation of the heads is an important experience of many units in Hubei in quickly achieving revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination. The newly developed industrial city of Huangshi is at the forefront of the province. In the past three months, the city has held more than 1,300 study classes, with more than 100,000 participants. These study classes have helped the heads of the two factions overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and strongly promoted revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination.

Like Huangshi, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places in Hubei have made the heads of the two factions increasingly aware that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination is a fierce class struggle. The class enemies, when facing their doom, will definitely try their best to sabotage the revolutionary great alliance. Their last move to sabotage the revolutionary great alliance is to create splits within the revolutionary ranks and manipulate the poisonous snake of factionalism to attack the proletariat. Therefore, at this crucial moment when the Cultural Revolution is about to achieve overall victory, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has become the most vicious and dangerous enemy within the revolutionary ranks. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses say with great excitement: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The class enemies attempt to use the selfishness of some people in the revolutionary ranks to maliciously instill bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to attack the proletariat; we must resolutely smash factionalism, cut off the black hands in time, and hold high the banner of revolutionary great alliance.

The broad officers and soldiers of the Wuhan units of the People's Liberation Army have most resolutely responded to the battle call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao to "hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution," and most resolutely executed the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. They are an extremely important factor in promoting the continuous advancement of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in various places in Hubei. The broad officers and soldiers fighting on the front line of "three supports and two militaries" have always regarded the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions as the interests of the party, the revolution, and the people, and regarded whether to execute the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions as an important standard to test whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the revolution. Their exemplary actions have strongly promoted the achievement of revolutionary great alliance and three-in-one combination in various places.

    毛主席最新指示为广大群众所掌握，变成巨大物质力量
    湖北革命大联合三结合浪潮汹涌澎湃
    武汉市基本上实现革命大联合；全省绝大部分专区、市和县实现了革命大联合，其中很多地方和厂矿企业等单位已成立革委会或革筹小组
    据新华社武汉十八日电本社记者述评：在大学习、大运用、大落实毛主席最新指示的高潮中，湖北各地革命大联合和革命三结合汇成了一股气势磅礴的洪流，有如千河万流归长江，破浪前进，势不可挡。
    毛主席的最新指示，这一最强劲的东风，吹得湖北各地热气腾腾，喜报频传。从城市到农村，从山区到平原，实现革命大联合的捷报，一张接着一张；建立革命委员会的喜讯，一个接着一个。到目前为止，在英雄的江城——武汉，已经基本上实现革命大联合，全省绝大部分专区、市和县也实现了革命大联合，其中一大批专区、市、县和厂矿企业、学校、机关成立了革命委员会或革筹小组。
    不谋私利、不出风头、埋头苦干、革命彻底性最强的工人阶级，一马当先，做出榜样；各条战线的革命群众，急起直追，紧紧跟上；基层单位的工作扎扎实实，一步一个脚印，基础牢固，水到渠成，这是湖北各地革命大联合和革命三结合的最突出特点。具有光荣革命传统的武汉工人阶级，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，在中国人民解放军武汉部队的支持和帮助下，在革命大联合过程中首创了坚持摆好“三个关系”、狠抓“三个入手”、实现“三个互相促进”的经验。他们摆正了全市性革命大联合同本厂、本车间、本班组革命大联合的关系，从狠抓基层单位的革命大联合入手、由下促上，上下结合，互相促进；摆正了组织上实现革命大联合同思想上实现和巩固革命大联合的关系，从狠抓思想上的革命大联合入手，思想带行动，言行一致，学用结合，互相促进；摆正了思想上的大联合同斗私批修的关系，从狠抓破私立公入手，急用先学，立竿见影，具体问题的解决与世界观的改造相结合，互相促进。他们这种扎扎实实的模范行动，不仅使全市百分之九十以上的工矿企业，按厂矿、车间、班组实现了革命大联合，而且促进全市各条战线出现了革命大联合和革命三结合的崭新局面。
    毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。湖北省革命大联合和革命三结合新高潮的蓬勃兴起，正是因为各地广大工农群众、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，把实现、发展和巩固革命大联合和革命三结合，作为全面落实毛主席最新指示的一个最重要的步骤，作为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一场最关键的硬仗，作为检验自己是不是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一次最严峻的考验。许多工厂、人民公社、学校、机关，在反复学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论的同时，认真总结了一年多来贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的最新指示的情况，更加深切地体会到，只有实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，全面落实毛主席的最新指示才有基础，完成一九六八年的五项战斗任务才有把握，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利才有保证。毛主席最新指示掌握了广大革命群众，就变成无坚不摧的巨大物质力量，出现了革命大跃进的新局面。
    在支左部队帮助下，两派群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，各革命组织的头头一起学习，把学习班办成大兴革命学风的样板，办成打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的红色阵地。狠抓头头的思想革命化，这是湖北各地许多单位迅速实现革命大联合和革命三结合的一条重要经验。新兴工业城市黄石，走在全省各地的最前列。近三个月来，全市开办了一千三百多期学习班，参加学习的学员达十万余人。这些学习班使两派头头克服派性，增强党性，有力地推动了革命大联合和三结合。
    同黄石一样，湖北各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，参加学习的两派头头越来越清醒地认识到：落实毛主席的最新指示，实现革命大联合和革命三结合，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。阶级敌人在末日来临的时候，一定会拚命破坏革命大联合，而它们破坏革命大联合的最后一手，就是在革命派队伍中制造分裂，操纵派性这条毒蛇向无产阶级进攻。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的关键时刻，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就成为革命派内部的一个最凶恶、最危险的敌人。广大无产阶级革命派无比激动地说：毛主席教导我们，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”阶级敌人妄想利用革命派中某些人的私心，恶毒地灌输资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，向无产阶级进攻；我们就要坚决打倒派性，及时斩断黑手，高举革命大联合的大旗。
    中国人民解放军武汉部队广大指战员，最坚决响应林彪副主席发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召，最坚决地执行支左不支派的原则，是促进湖北各地革命大联合和革命三结合不断前进的一个极为重要的因素。战斗在“三支”
  “两军”第一线的广大指战员，始终把支左不支派的原则，看成是党的利益、革命的利益、人民的利益，把执行不执行支左不支派的原则，作为检验自己是不是忠于毛主席、忠于党、忠于人民、忠于革命的一条重要标准。他们的模范行动，有力地促进了各地革命大联合和三结合的实现。
