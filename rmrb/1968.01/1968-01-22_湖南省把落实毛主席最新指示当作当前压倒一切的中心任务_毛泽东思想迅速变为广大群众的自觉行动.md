The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Hunan Province, with deep class sentiments of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are swiftly and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Revolutionary committees in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Shaoyang, Yueyang, and Changde have all made decisions and issued notices, making the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions the overriding task at hand. Local military units have dispatched large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, rural areas, offices, schools, stations, and docks to widely propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Currently, a magnificent and grand movement to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is vigorously and solidly unfolding across urban and rural areas in Hunan.

The entire province's military and civilian population have expressed their determination to be model examples in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that every instruction from Chairman Mao is fully implemented, and achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

Holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and more broadly and deeply carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, so that Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and specific policies are directly grasped by the masses and become the conscious actions of the revolutionary masses, is the most distinctive feature of Hunan Province's comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Currently, there are over 15,000 such study classes in factories, rural areas, offices, schools, neighborhoods, and military units across the province, with over 2 million people participating in the studies. Study classes organized by various localities, units, and military units all take the serious study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their fundamental task. They adhere to the principle of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie" and establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, combining learning with practice, achieving immediate results, and turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the masses. Many places have also created good experiences in running study classes, achieving integration of upper and lower levels, internal and external elements, points and surfaces, and combining full-time and part-time learning. The content is concise but profound, and the forms are diverse and lively, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and understood by all, young and old.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Hunan Province believe that the process of comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is one of breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," sweeping away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, and using the great Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a great mass movement of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and factionalism, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as arrows to hit the targets of local revolutionary struggles and personal thoughts, truly integrating Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their blood and actions. The revolutionary masses in the Changsha railway system, who previously suffered from factionalism and could not achieve revolutionary unity, recently studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on the lack of fundamental conflicts of interest within the working class and the impossibility of splitting into two irreconcilable factions under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They broke down the "self" and eliminated factionalism, quickly achieving revolutionary unity across the entire Changsha railway bureau system. The revolutionary masses in Chaoling County recently studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the two factions minimizing criticism of each other's shortcomings and errors, letting others speak for themselves, and seeking common ground while reserving differences. They combined study with rectification and carried out remembrance of bitterness and sweetness activities, greatly enhancing the revolutionary masses' class consciousness and self-awareness in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Within a few days, the entire county achieved revolutionary unity. Currently, 74% of prefectures, counties, and cities, and 80% of industrial and mining enterprises across Hunan Province have achieved revolutionary unity. Revolutionary committees have been established in six prefectures and cities, including Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Yueyang.

    湖南省把落实毛主席最新指示当作当前压倒一切的中心任务
    毛泽东思想迅速变为广大群众的自觉行动
    据新华社长沙二十日电　湖南省广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，迅速地、全面地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    长沙、株洲、邵阳、岳阳、常德等地区革筹小组，纷纷作出决定，发出通知，把落实毛主席最新指示当作当前压倒一切的中心任务。各地驻军派出了大量的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、机关、学校、车站、码头，广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论。目前，一个气势磅礴、规模壮阔的全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，正在湖南城乡各地轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地展开。全省军民表示，坚决做学习最新指示、执行最新指示、宣传最新指示、捍卫最新指示的模范，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，更广泛深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，使毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策为广大群众所直接掌握，变为广大革命群众的自觉行动，这是湖南省全面落实毛主席最新指示的最大特点。目前全省工厂、农村、机关、学校、街道和人民解放军驻军举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班有一万五千多个，有二百多万人参加了学习。各地、各单位和解放军驻军举办的学习班，都把认真学习、坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示作为根本任务。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，学用结合，立竿见影，使毛主席的最新指示成为群众的自觉行动。许多地方还创造了办学习班的好经验，做到上下结合，内外结合，点面结合，脱产学和业余学相结合，内容少而精，形式多而活，使毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，老幼皆知。
    湖南省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众认为，全面落实毛主席最新指示的过程，就是大破“私”字，大立“公”字，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，用伟大的毛泽东思想改造自己世界观的过程。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展了斗私批修，横扫派性的伟大群众运动，用毛主席最新指示之“矢”，射当地革命斗争实际、自己思想实际之“的”，使毛主席的最新指示，真正溶化在自己的血液中，落实到自己的行动上。长沙铁路系统各革命群众组织，以前由于闹山头，闹派性，一直没有实现革命大联合。最近，革命职工反复学习毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大教导，大家大破“私”字，铲除派性，很快实现了整个长沙铁路分局系统的革命大联合。茶陵县各派革命群众组织，最近反复学习毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示。他们边学习边整风，并开展忆苦思甜活动，大大提高了革命群众的阶级觉悟和贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性。在几天之内，全县实现了革命大联合。目前，湖南全省已有百分之七十四的专区、县、市和百分之八十的工矿企业单位，实现了革命大联合。长沙、株洲、岳阳等六个专区、市成立了革筹小组。
