Chairman Mao's great call to learn from Dazhai in agriculture has become the conscious action of the revolutionary masses of Xiyang County.

The great victory of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside of Xiyang County has been achieved, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Taiyuan, January 5 — Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the situation in the countryside of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, is excellent in terms of the Cultural Revolution and production.

In the rural areas of the entire county, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have been fully mobilized. From production teams to peasant households, from dining halls to fields, everywhere is a battlefield for "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism." The entire county has become a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, men, women, old, and young, all care about state affairs and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. Here, capitalist and revisionist goods have become stinking piles of dog shit, and the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents have become rats that everyone wants to beat. Here, the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: The one who gave birth to me is my mother, the one who raised me is the Party, and the one who nurtured our growth is the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's great battle call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" has become the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county. They regard listening to Chairman Mao's words and taking the Dazhai road as the most powerful counterattack against the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism. Mao Zedong Thought and the Dazhai spirit have become a powerful material force. In 1967, Xiyang County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production, achieving "six excellences" in agriculture, and the total grain output of the county increased by 40% compared to 1966. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: This is the rich fruit of the Cultural Revolution, and it is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The great victory of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside of Xiyang County is the result of firmly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The main experiences they gained in revolutionary practice are:

1. Mobilize the masses to the fullest extent, grasp the living facts of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the countryside, guide the masses to always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents, and fight them fiercely, overthrow and expose them, and eliminate the poison.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Xiyang County have deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. In 1962, during the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev, through his agents, vigorously advocated "three autonomies and one contract," and spread the wind of individual farming. Some places appeared class differentiation, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were in danger of suffering again. Our great leader Chairman Mao called for carrying out socialist education to repel the capitalist onslaught. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, through his agents, implemented the pseudo-leftist and rightist bourgeois reactionary line, "striking a large area and protecting a small number," and carried out false "four cleanups" and true restoration. In 1964, a handful of capitalist roaders within the original Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee used the name of "four cleanups" to label a large number of revolutionary cadres in Xiyang County as "anti-party elements." This "four cleanups" was completely carried out according to the "Peach Garden Experience" concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Under the persecution of this pseudo-leftist and rightist bourgeois reactionary line, in the 12 communes that carried out "four cleanups" in the entire county, the cadres of brigades and production teams were subjected to ruthless struggle and merciless attacks. Even the Dazhai Brigade, which was personally established by Chairman Mao, was labeled as a "third-class brigade" with "serious problems," and many excellent cadres were subjected to attacks and persecution.

The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, in order to promote the great criticism throughout the county, on the one hand, mobilized the masses to the fullest extent, compiled the various crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line into a book, and distributed it to the broad revolutionary masses as a negative teaching material; on the other hand, they found the "live targets" who faithfully implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev at the provincial, regional, and county levels, and held several county-wide meetings of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to carry out large-scale exposure, criticism, and struggle. Such struggle meetings were not only held at the county level, but also at the commune and brigade levels. In the great criticism and struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres carried out the "three remembrances, three complaints, and three summaries" activity. This means remembering the sweetness after liberation, complaining about the bitterness of being oppressed by class enemies before liberation, and summarizing that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can the proletariat and laboring people achieve liberation. Remembering the sweetness of socialism, complaining about the bitterness brought by the capitalist restoration plot of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and summarizing the important experience of the struggle for power. Remembering the sweetness of adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, complaining about the bitterness of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, and summarizing the great victories of the Cultural Revolution. This "three remembrances, three complaints, and three summaries" activity closely linked the criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party with the criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, educated the cadres, raised the class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, exposed the great plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, and further aroused the boundless love of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres for the great leader Chairman Mao. In the great criticism, they always directed the spearhead of the struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The mass organizations united and fought the enemy together, consolidating and developing the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Workers and peasants guarded their posts, carried out the revolution and promoted production, making the revolution roar and production boil.

2. Firmly implement Chairman Mao's instructions to "believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres," let them lead the movement and organize production, and never direct the spearhead of the struggle against the broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside, but against their own people.

Xiyang County is a revolutionary old base area with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and land reform was thoroughly carried out. The broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside are mostly excellent representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants who emerged in the fierce class struggle of land reform and have been tested in the socialist revolution. They have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and the Party, firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and firmly follow Chairman Mao. After investigation and research, the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee believed that although there are some errors among the broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside, those with errors in direction and line are very few, and most are shortcomings and errors in style, attitude, and method.

Through the help of the masses, they are definitely able to improve their understanding, correct their shortcomings and errors, and shoulder the heavy responsibility of carrying out the revolution and promoting production. Comrade Chen Yonggui, the head of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, said: Cadres will not make mistakes, but we must distinguish the nature of the mistakes. Bad cadres are indeed a minority. We cannot overthrow all cadres. In the cadre issue, if we do not distinguish between good and bad, between enemies and ourselves, it is very detrimental to the proletariat and the revolutionary cause. If we overthrow everything, we will not overthrow the enemy, but instead expand the enemy's strength and sabotage the Cultural Revolution in the countryside.

In February of last year, during the process of seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Xiyang County Committee, the County Revolutionary Committee, based on the correct assessment of the broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside, followed Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Comrades Chen Yonggui and others, along with revolutionary cadres from the county and communes and cadres from the military department, carried the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside" and visited all 20 communes in the county. They mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to help the cadres check their mistakes and make new contributions to the people, turning Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's instructions into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Now, more than 95% of the grassroots cadres in the countryside have taken on the heavy responsibility of revolution and production. They take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism, take the lead in carrying out the revolution and promoting production, and go deep among the masses, change their style, and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, upper levels and lower levels. Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Because Xiyang County has such a large number of grassroots revolutionary cadres leading the revolution and production, it has ensured the implementation and execution of the Party's various policies and directives, thus promoting the victory of various tasks.

3. The Cultural Revolution in the countryside must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, organize a rural cultural revolutionary army with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, liberate themselves, and educate themselves. At the same time, the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must be firmly suppressed.

Chairman Mao said: "Without poor peasants, there is no revolution." The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the County Committee. After seizing power, all work was carried out by mobilizing and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Because they firmly relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, they united the broad masses of commune members; the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists could be timely suppressed, ensuring the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution.

4. With "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held to educate the cadres of brigades and production teams and the broad masses of commune members with Mao Zedong Thought.

In April of last year, soon after Xiyang County seized power, some cadres had incorrect attitudes towards the masses and did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and some cadres had negative thoughts. Based on this situation, the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee held a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the Dazhai Brigade, organizing cadres from communes, production brigades, and production teams to participate in the study in batches. This study class took Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as its motto, took Dazhai as its classroom, studied Chairman Mao's various great instructions and related commentaries, took the cadres and commune members of Dazhai as examples, and carried out self-education. The cadres participating in the study worked while learning and asked the people of Dazhai to introduce their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out class struggle, highlighting proletarian politics, carrying out a great ideological revolution, and striving hard and relying on their own efforts. Through this study, the broad cadres broke down selfishness and established public-mindedness, and their class consciousness was greatly improved. This study class has been held for more than ten sessions, and each session has been very effective. Recently, the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee summarized the experience in this regard. They firmly responded to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up in various communes and many production brigades, with both cadres and commune members participating in the study.

5. The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary committees of the communes timely strengthened the leadership of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside. The revolutionary leading cadres of the county and commune levels often went deep into the brigades and production teams to investigate and study the situation, grasp the direction, and help the lower-level cadres solve problems.

Comrade Chen Yonggui believed that in the Cultural Revolution in the countryside, the county and commune levels occupy an important position. First, the leadership at the county and commune levels must be in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Second, after the proletarian revolutionary faction seizes power, it must actively lead the Cultural Revolution movement in the brigades and production teams, so that the problems in the brigades and production teams can be solved in time, and the movement can be promoted to develop forward.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction in Xiyang County seized power, the revolutionary committees at the county and commune levels sent a large number of revolutionary cadres to the brigades and production teams, first as students of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and then as teachers. Their main task is to propagate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Party's policies, and at the same time, conduct investigations and research, grasp the situation, and solve problems in time.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the Cultural Revolution in the countryside of Xiyang County is developing in depth. With the deepening of the great criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a high tide of transforming old ideas and institutions and establishing new ideas and institutions has emerged. The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, is determined to take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, stand at the forefront of the movement, and actively lead the great criticism and struggle, and seize new victories in the Cultural Revolution in the countryside.

    听毛主席的话，走大寨的路，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在农村的修正主义流毒
    毛主席关于农业学大寨的伟大号召  成为昔阳全县革命群众的自觉行动
    全县无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利，革命生产形势大好
    新华社太原五日电　在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，山西省昔阳县农村无产阶级文化大革命和生产形势一片大好。
    在全县农村，广大贫下中农和革命干部充分发动起来了。从生产队到社员家庭，从饭场到地头，到处都是“斗私，批修”的战场，全县成了活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。广大贫下中农和革命干部，男女老少，人人关心国家大事，批判中国赫鲁晓夫。在这里，资本主义、修正主义的货色，已经成为臭不可闻的狗屎堆，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在当地的代理人已经成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。在这里，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高飘扬，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心。贫下中农说：生我是娘，养我是党，哺育我们成长的是我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席，是伟大的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席发出的“农业学大寨”的伟大战斗号召，已经成为全县广大革命群众的自觉行动。他们把听毛主席的话，走大寨之路，做为对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义阴谋的最有力的反击。毛泽东思想，大寨精神，变成了强大的物质力量。一九六七年，昔阳县农业生产获得了历史上前所未有的特大丰收，做到了农业“六好”，全县粮食总产量比一九六六年增加百分之四十。贫下中农高兴地说：这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    昔阳县农村无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大胜利，是坚决贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的结果。他们在革命实践中取得的主要经验是：
    一、放手发动群众，抓住农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的活事实，引导群众把斗争的矛头始终对准党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们在当地的代理人，狠批猛斗，批倒批臭，肃清流毒。
    昔阳县广大贫下中农和革命干部对中国赫鲁晓夫有着深仇大恨。在一九六二年我国经济暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的代理人，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮单干风，有些地方出现了阶级分化，广大贫下中农又有受二遍苦的危险。我们伟大领袖毛主席号召进行社会主义教育，击退资本主义的猖狂进攻。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的代理人推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，进行假四清，真复辟。一九六四年，原山西省委、晋中地委、昔阳县委内一小撮走资派以四清为名，把昔阳县大批革命干部打成了“反党分子”。这次四清完全是按照中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的假四清、真复辟的“桃园经验”搞的。在这条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线迫害下，全县进行“四清”的十二个公社中，大队、生产队的干部受到了残酷斗争，无情打击，连毛主席亲自树立起来的大寨大队也被划为“有严重问题”的“三类队”，许多优秀干部受到了打击和迫害。
    昔阳县革命委员会为了推动全县的革命大批判，一面放手发动群众，把揭发出的中国赫鲁晓夫和他在当地的代理人推行资产阶级反动路线的种种罪行，汇编成册，发给广大革命群众，作为反面教材；一面找省、地、县忠实推行中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的“活靶子”，作为反面教员，连续召开几次全县的贫下中农和革命干部代表大会，进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争。这种批斗大会，不只是县里开，公社开，大队也开。在大批判、大斗争中，广大贫下中农和革命干部开展了“三忆三诉三总结”活动。这就是忆翻身后的甜，诉解放前受阶级敌人压迫的苦，总结出只有毛主席和共产党领导，无产阶级和劳动人民才能获得解放。忆社会主义的甜，诉党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义带来的苦，总结夺权斗争的重要经验。忆坚持毛主席革命路线的甜，诉受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，总结文化大革命以来的伟大胜利。这个“三忆三诉三总结”的活动，把对本地党内一小撮走资派的批判斗争同对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判斗争紧密结合起来，教育了干部，提高了广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟，识破了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的大阴谋，更加激发了广大革命群众、革命干部对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。在革命大批判中，他们把斗争矛头始终指向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在当地的代理人。群众组织之间相互团结，共同对敌，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。工人、农民坚守岗位，抓革命、促生产，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。
    二、坚决执行毛主席的指示，“相信和依靠干部的大多数”，让他们既领导运动，又组织生产，绝不把斗争矛头指向广大农村基层干部，对准自己人。
    昔阳县是具有光荣革命传统的革命老根据地，土地改革搞得彻底。广大农村基层干部绝大多数是在土地改革激烈的阶级斗争中涌现出来，并经过社会主义革命考验的贫下中农的优秀代表。他们对毛主席对党无限热爱，坚决听毛主席的话，坚决跟毛主席走。昔阳县革命委员会经过调查研究，认为广大农村基层干部中有一些是有错误的，但属于方向路线错误的是很少的，多数是作风、态度、方法方面的缺点错误。
　　经过群众帮助，他们是一定能够提高认识，改正缺点错误，担负起抓革命、促生产的重担的。昔阳县革命委员会主任陈永贵同志说：干部不会不犯错误，要分清什么性质的错误，坏干部究竟是少数。不能凡是干部都打倒。在干部问题上，要是好坏不分，敌我不分，对无产阶级、对革命事业是十分不利的。要打倒一切，就不会打倒敌人，反而会扩大敌人的力量，破坏农村文化大革命。
    去年二月，在向昔阳县委一小撮走资派夺权的过程中，县革命委员会根据对全县广大农村基层干部的正确估计，按照毛主席的干部政策，由陈永贵等负责同志和县、社的革命干部和武装部的干部一起，带着《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，走遍全县二十个公社，发动贫下中农帮助干部检查错误，为人民立新功，使毛主席和党中央的指示变成广大革命群众和革命干部的自觉行动。现在，全县百分之九十五以上的农村基层干部，挑起了革命和生产两副重担。他们带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头斗私批修，带头抓革命、促生产，深入群众，改变作风，密切了干部和群众、上级和下级的关系。毛主席教导我们说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”昔阳县由于有这样一大批基层革命干部领导革命和生产，就保证了党的各项方针政策的贯彻和执行，从而推动了各项工作的胜利发展。
    三、农村文化大革命必须依靠贫下中农，组织以贫下中农为主体的农村文化革命大军，自己解放自己，自己教育自己。同时，必须坚决打击地、富、反、坏、右的破坏活动。
    毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”昔阳县革命委员会依靠贫下中农夺了县委内一小撮走资派的权。在夺权之后，各项工作都是发动和依靠贫下中农去搞。由于坚定地依靠了贫下中农，就团结了广大社员群众；对地、富、反、坏、右的破坏活动，就能及时给以回击，保证了无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。
    四、以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，对大队、生产队干部和广大社员进行毛泽东思想教育。
    去年四月，昔阳县刚夺权不久，有个别干部对群众的态度不正确，对毛主席的革命路线理解不深，还有一部分干部有消极思想。根据这种情况，昔阳县革命委员会就在大寨大队举办了毛泽东思想学习班，分期分批组织公社、生产大队和生产队的干部参加学习。这种学习班以毛主席的“老三篇”为座右铭，以大寨为课堂，学习毛主席的各项伟大指示和有关社论，以大寨干部和社员为榜样，进行自我教育。参加学习的干部一边劳动，一边请大寨人介绍活学活用毛主席著作，进行阶级斗争，突出无产阶级政治，大搞思想革命化，艰苦奋斗、自力更生等经验。通过这种学习，广大干部大破私字，大立公字，阶级觉悟大大提高。这种学习班已经办了十多期，每期效果都很好。不久前，昔阳县革命委员会总结了这方面的经验。他们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，在各公社和许多生产大队都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的既有干部，也有社员。
    五、昔阳县革命委员会和公社的革命委员会，及时加强了农村文化大革命的领导。县、社两级革命委员会的革命领导干部，经常深入大队、生产队调查研究，了解情况，掌握方向，帮助下面干部解决问题。
    陈永贵同志认为，在农村文化大革命中，县、社两级革命委员会占有重要的地位。首先，县、社两级的领导权必须掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。第二，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，必须积极领导大队、生产队的文化大革命运动，这样才能使大队、生产队的问题及时得到解决，推动运动向前发展。
    昔阳县无产阶级革命派夺权以后，县、社两级革命委员会把大批革命干部放到大队、生产队，先当贫下中农的学生，后当先生。他们主要的任务是宣传毛主席的革命路线，宣传毛主席的最新指示和党的方针政策。同时，进行调查研究，掌握情况，遇到问题，及时解决。
    在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，昔阳县农村无产阶级文化大革命正向着纵深发展。随着对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地代理人的大批判，大斗争的逐步深入，已经出现了改造旧思想、旧制度，建立新思想、新制度的高潮。昔阳县革命委员会遵循毛主席的教导，决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，站在运动的最前列，积极地领导革命大批判和斗批改，夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
