Mao Zedong Thought is the Party's guiding ideology. Chairman Mao is the great leader of our Party. Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guiding ideology of our Party. We, the broad masses of Party members and revolutionary soldiers and peasants, have boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao and for the great Mao Zedong Thought. However, the Chinese Khrushchev stands on the opposite side, claiming that "we obey the Party, the Central Committee, and the truth, not an individual. No individual is worth obeying." This is a vicious attack by the Chinese Khrushchev against our great leader Chairman Mao, a mad attempt to oppose Mao Zedong Thought with a poisonous arrow.

Lenin pointed out: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." The history of our Party and the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle fully proves that it is Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought that have overcome the "left" and right opportunism within the Party, corrected the revolutionary course; it is Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought that have led the Chinese people to defeat American imperialism and Japanese aggressors, overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries; it is Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought that have, in the international communist movement, defeated modern revisionism and set up the third milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism. In a word, as Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Chairman Mao is the representative of our times, the representative of the Party, the representative of the masses, the representative of the proletariat, the leader of the masses, the soul of the masses." "Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country."

The so-called "obeying the truth, not an individual" by the Chinese Khrushchev is a replica of the Khrushchev revisionist clique's opposition to "personal cult." The Soviet Khrushchev, under the pretext of opposing "personal cult," in fact opposed Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Khrushchev, under the banner of "obeying the truth, not an individual," viciously attacks Chairman Mao, slanders Mao Zedong Thought, and opposes making Mao Zedong Thought the fundamental guiding ideology of our Party. The Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet Khrushchev are singing the same tune, wearing the same pants, and are birds of a feather. The Chinese Khrushchev also attempts to replace Mao Zedong Thought with his revisionist junk. His so-called "obeying the Central Committee" means obeying his bourgeois black command; his so-called "obeying the truth" means obeying his black "cultivation." He repeatedly pushes his infamous black "cultivation" into the hands of Party members, claiming himself to be one of the top figures in the country, comparing himself to Marx of China. If we adopt the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist junk as the guiding ideology of our Party, the result will be to turn our Party into a revisionist party, a fascist party. This is a great conspiracy. We, every Communist Party member, every revolutionary soldier of the proletariat, must not let his conspiracy succeed!

Only Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guiding ideology of our Party; only by rectifying the Party's organization and strengthening Party building according to Mao Zedong Thought can we build our Party into a more vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy; only by arming every Party member with Mao Zedong Thought can we make Party members into vanguard fighters of the proletariat. In recent years, the Party committees and branches in our unit have insisted on taking Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental guiding ideology. We use the "mini-rectification" method to educate Party members to recall the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, understand how the Party has developed and grown stronger under Chairman Mao's leadership, and examine whether their thoughts conform to Mao Zedong Thought. We often grasp the living thoughts, study Chairman Mao's teachings on this aspect, and solve one problem. We also take holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the main standard for developing new Party members. In this way, our Party committees and branches have all shown a new situation.

We deeply feel that our Party, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology, is invincible. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline; wherever it is applied, it works; Mao Zedong Thought is our "family treasure," to be passed down from generation to generation. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, unshakable even if the sky falls; absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, daring to brave the sword mountain and fire sea; forever loyal to Chairman Mao, unchanging even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble.

    毛泽东思想是党的指导思想
    政委　毕树忠　副指导员　杨先芝
    毛主席是我们党的伟大领袖。毛泽东思想是我党的根本指导思想。对于伟大领袖毛主席，对于伟大的毛泽东思想，我们广大党员和工农兵革命群众无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜。而中国赫鲁晓夫却完全站在敌对方面，胡说什么“我们是服从党，服从中央，服从真理，而非服从个人。任何一个个人都不值得我们服从的。”这是中国赫鲁晓夫放出的恶毒攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，疯狂反对毛泽东思想的一支大毒箭。
    列宁指出：“没有革命理论，就不会有坚强的社会主义政党”。我党和我国人民进行革命斗争的历史充分证明：是毛主席，是毛泽东思想，克服了党内“左”右倾机会主义，拨正了革命的航向；是毛主席，是毛泽东思想，指引中国人民打败了美帝国主义、日本侵略者，推翻了国民党反动派的统治；是毛主席，是毛泽东思想，在国际共产主义运动中，战胜了现代修正主义，树立了马克思列宁主义发展史上的第三个里程碑。千句万句并一句，正如林副主席指出的：“毛主席是我们时代的代表，是党的代表，是群众的代表，是无产阶级的代表，是群众的领袖，群众的灵魂。”“毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“服从真理，而非服从个人”，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团反对“个人迷信”的翻版。苏联赫鲁晓夫以反对“个人迷信”为名，行反对马克思列宁主义之实。中国赫鲁晓夫打着“服从真理，而非服从个人”的幌子，恶毒攻击毛主席、诽谤毛泽东思想，反对把毛泽东思想作为我党的根本指导思想。中国赫鲁晓夫和苏联赫鲁晓夫是唱的一个调子，穿的一条裤子，是一丘之貉。中国赫鲁晓夫还妄图以他那套修正主义的破烂货色代替毛泽东思想。他说的服从“中央”，就是服从他的资产阶级黑司令部；他说的服从“真理”，就是服从他的黑《修养》。他一再向党员手里塞他那本臭名昭著的黑《修养》，他把自己说成是全国“数一数二”的人物，比作中国的马克思。如果把中国赫鲁晓夫那套修正主义货色作为我党的指导思想，结果必将使我党变成修正主义的党，法西斯党。这是一个大阴谋。我们每个共产党员，每个无产阶级革命战士，绝不能让他的阴谋得逞！
    只有毛泽东思想，才是我们党的根本指导思想；只有按照毛泽东思想整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，才能把我们的党建设成为更加朝气蓬勃的能领导无产阶级和革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的先锋队组织；只有用毛泽东思想武装每个党员的头脑，才能使党员成为无产阶级先锋战士。这几年来，我们所在部队的党委和支部，坚持以毛泽东思想作为根本指导思想。我们用“小整风”的方法，教育党员回忆党内两条路线斗争历史，懂得党在毛主席领导下如何发展、壮大和检查自己的思想是否符合毛泽东思想。我们经常抓住活思想，学习毛主席关于这方面的教导，解决一个问题。我们还把高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、活学活用毛泽东思想作为发展新党员的主要标准。这样，我们党委和支部都出现了新气象。
    我们深深体会到：我们党用毛泽东思想作为指导思想，无往而不胜。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，用到哪里哪里灵；毛泽东思想是我们的“传家宝”，要一代一代传下去。我们要无限忠于毛主席，天崩地裂不动摇；绝对忠于毛主席，刀山火海也敢闯；永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂不变心。
