Less than two months after the devaluation of the pound, the British government announced on January 16 that it would withdraw British colonial troops from the Far East and the Persian Gulf by 1971, cancel the order for fifty F-111 fighter-bombers from the United States, reduce the number of military personnel and civilian staff in the armed forces, and cut spending on education, housing, roads, and so-called welfare at home to reduce expenditures and alleviate the British economic crisis. This so-called package plan, which the British ruling class calls a "heartbreaking decision," marks the fact that British imperialism has indeed fallen into a desperate plight.

British imperialism rose to power by plundering and enslaving the peoples of Asia and Africa. The sea route through the Suez Canal to Britain's colonies in East Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East was once the lifeline of British imperialism, maintaining its colonial empire, and was called the "lifeline" of British imperialism. Post-war national liberation movements in Asia and Africa have destroyed the old colonial system of imperialism. The once mighty British Empire has crumbled. However, to maintain its remaining colonies and colonial interests and to suppress the anti-imperialist struggles of the Asian and African peoples, British imperialism has eagerly followed the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism, continuing to maintain a large military force and military bases east of the Suez Canal. British imperialism's counter-revolutionary policies have not been able to withstand the revolutionary storm of the Asian and African peoples but have further weakened British imperialism. The annual military expenditure of over 2.2 billion pounds has deepened Britain's economic difficulties. Faced with this cruel reality, British imperialism had to announce last year that it would gradually reduce its overseas troops and withdraw colonial troops from Southeast Asia and the Persian Gulf by the mid-1970s. However, the severe political and economic crisis forced the British government to take the measure of withdrawing troops from the Suez Canal region earlier after the devaluation of the pound. The desperate plight of this declining British imperialist is fully exposed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world."

British imperialism's decision to withdraw colonial troops from the Suez Canal region earlier not only shows the decline of British imperialism but also reflects the deepening contradictions within the imperialist camp under the impact of the revolutionary storms of the anti-imperialist struggles of the Asian and African peoples, and the entire imperialist system is accelerating towards comprehensive collapse. American imperialism has always used British imperialism as its accomplice in its aggression against Asia. When it concentrated all its efforts on the war of aggression against Vietnam, it wanted to rely on British imperialism to defend the second line in Asia. Now, when American imperialism is at its wits' end in the war of aggression against Vietnam, Britain is withdrawing troops from the Suez Canal region earlier, which cannot but make American imperialism, already feeling short of troops, fall into a more difficult situation of having to choose between two evils. This shows that in the face of the severe political and economic crises facing the capitalist world, with imperialist countries scrambling to save themselves and fighting each other, American imperialism is more isolated.

Of course, British imperialism's announcement of an earlier withdrawal from the Suez Canal region does not mean that it will lay down its butcher's knife and become a Buddhist monk overnight. On the contrary, its actions are merely a retreat to advance, attempting to temporarily contract, reorganize its strength, and maintain Britain's status as a great power, and prepare to one day revive the dream of the British Empire. It will continue to maintain colonial troops in Hong Kong, help its puppet lackeys establish so-called "defense arrangements," and announce that it will "dispatch" military forces maintained in Europe and the British mainland overseas, including supporting United Nations actions, when the situation requires it. It continues to work for the American imperialist "peace talks" conspiracy in Vietnam and engages in anti-China collusion with Japanese militarism and the Soviet revisionist clique. It also vigorously promotes neo-colonialism in Asia, Africa, and other regions. All this fully shows that British imperialism remains an accomplice of American imperialism and a vicious enemy of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The revolutionary peoples of the world must remain vigilant against all imperialism, including British imperialism, strengthen their struggle, and continue to deal them heavy blows.

However, the measures taken by British imperialism cannot save its political and economic crisis, which is in its death throes, but can only accelerate its decline. Its attempt to find a way out in Western Europe will first face resistance and opposition from Western European countries led by France. Its attempt to rely on American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Japanese militarism to maintain its remaining colonial interests will also be doomed to failure in the revolutionary storms of the Asian and African peoples. At the same time, as it intensifies the exploitation of the British people, class contradictions within Britain will further intensify, and its reactionary rule will become more unstable. All of British imperialism's efforts to save itself from death are nothing but desperate struggles.

    英帝国主义的穷途末路
    本报评论员
    英镑贬值以后不到两个月，英国政府又在一月十六日宣布，决定在一九七一年以前从远东和波斯湾撤退英国殖民军队，取消向美国订购的五十架F—111战斗轰炸机，削减武装力量的兵员和文职人员，并且压缩国内教育、住房、公路和所谓福利方面的经费，以便削减开支，缓和英国经济危机。这个被英国统治集团称为“伤心的决定”的所谓一揽子计划，标志着英帝国主义确已沦落到了日暮途穷的境地。
    英帝国主义是依靠掠夺和奴役亚非人民起家的。经过苏伊士运河通往英国在东非、中东和远东的殖民地的航路，曾经是英帝国主义维持它的殖民帝国的大动脉，被称为英帝国主义的“生命线”。战后亚洲、非洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，摧毁了帝国主义的旧的殖民体系。曾经盛极一时的大英帝国土崩瓦解了。但是英帝国主义为了维护它残存的殖民地和殖民利益，镇压亚非人民的反帝斗争，竭力追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，在苏伊士运河以东地区继续保持庞大的军事力量和军事基地。英帝国主义的这种反革命政策，丝毫抵挡不住亚非人民的革命风暴，反而使英帝国主义进一步削弱。年达二十二亿多英镑的巨额军费开支，加深了英国经济的困难。在这个无情的现实面前，英帝国主义不得不在去年宣布要逐步削减海外驻军，并在七十年代的中期从东南亚和波斯湾撤出殖民军队。但是，严重的政治经济危机，迫使英国政府在英镑贬值以后，紧接着又采取提前从苏伊士运河以东撤军的措施。英帝国主义这个破落户的山穷水尽窘态，可谓毕露了。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。”
    英帝国主义被迫提前从苏伊士以东撤走殖民军队，不仅表明英帝国主义的衰败不堪，而且反映了在亚非人民反帝斗争的革命风暴冲击下，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，整个帝国主义制度正加速走向全面崩溃。美帝国主义一向利用英帝国主义作为它侵略亚洲的帮凶。它在集中全力进行侵越战争的时候，想依靠英帝国主义在亚洲防守第二线。现在，当美帝国主义在侵越战争中正走投无路的时候，英国却提前从苏伊士以东撤军，这不能不使已经深感兵力不足的美帝国主义更加陷于顾此失彼的困境。这说明，在资本主义世界普遍面临严重的政治经济危机、帝国主义国家纷纷各自逃命、互相倾轧的情况下，美帝国主义更加孤立了。
    当然，英帝国主义宣布提前从苏伊士以东撤军，绝不表明它从此放下屠刀，立地成佛了。相反，它的这种做法，不过是以退为进，妄图暂时收缩，整顿实力，保住英国的大国地位，并且准备有朝一日重温大英帝国的好梦。它要在香港继续保持殖民军队，帮助它的傀儡走狗建立所谓“防务安排”，并且宣布要在“情况需要时”，把保持在欧洲和英国本土的军事力量“调遣到海外，包括支援联合国的行动在内”。它继续为美帝国主义在越南的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳，并且同日本军国主义势力和苏修集团大肆进行反华勾结。它还在亚非等地区竭力推行新殖民主义。这一切都充分说明，英帝国主义仍然是美帝国主义的一个帮凶，是亚非各国人民的一个凶恶的敌人。全世界革命人民必须对包括英帝国主义在内的一切帝国主义保持警惕，加强斗争，继续给它们以沉重的打击。
    但是，英帝国主义所采取的措施，挽救不了它病入膏肓的政治经济危机，只能使它加速没落。它想在西欧寻找出路的打算，首先要遭到以法国为代表的西欧国家的抵制和反对。它妄图依靠美帝、苏修和日本军国主义势力来维护它残存的殖民利益的图谋，也必将在亚非人民的革命风暴中彻底破产。同时，随着它加紧剥削英国人民，英国国内的阶级矛盾将更加激化，它的反动统治将更加不稳。英帝国主义一切企图挽救自己死亡命运的努力，都只能是绝望的挣扎而已。
