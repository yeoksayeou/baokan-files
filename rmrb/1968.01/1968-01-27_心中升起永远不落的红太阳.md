The golden sun rises in the east, shining brightly. The hearts of revolutionary soldiers are pounding fiercely, filled with boundless happiness and glory. The greatest leader of the world's revolutionary people, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, received us, the representatives of the Second Session of the Total Logistics Department's Conference on Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works. A thousand words and a thousand feelings surge in my heart, overflowing with excitement and tears of joy. I shout a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" I sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! A long, long life!

Last October 1st, on the solemn and majestic Tiananmen Gate, I had the honor of seeing our greatest commander, Chairman Mao, for the first time, fulfilling my greatest wish in life. On January 26th, I saw Chairman Mao again. In just a few months, I have seen Chairman Mao twice. This is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest motivation for me. It is also the greatest happiness and the greatest honor of my life.

On the day of the National Day in 1967, I stood happily next to Chairman Mao and personally heard Comrade Lin, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions: to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. What a thrilling and great program! From my own growth, I have personally experienced that to become a revolutionary soldier of the proletariat, to ensure that our country never changes color, and to uproot the roots of revisionism, we must constantly break away from selfishness and establish public spirit, and constantly undergo a thorough transformation of our worldview.

Only by constantly launching an offensive against "selfishness" can we remain steadfast when the Party and the people need us to sacrifice our interests, including our lives, without changing our faces or hearts, and march forward bravely. Only by constantly sparking a revolution in our souls, breaking down bourgeois ideology, and establishing Mao Zedong Thought, can we build a great wall of "public spirit" in our minds. I must deeply hate "selfishness," raise my awareness of fighting it, and fully boost my spirit of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. I will be a pioneer in fighting selfishness and a vanguard in criticizing revisionism, fighting "selfishness" and criticizing "revisionism" for life, and carrying the revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the greatest helmsman of the world's revolutionary people. Following the direction you point out, we will forever march from victory to victory! On the eve of last year's National Day, you personally inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions and issued a series of latest instructions. The east wind brings good news from afar, and the latest instructions spread everywhere. The brilliance of the red sun shines over the five lakes and four seas, and the guiding light illuminates our hearts and minds. Great truth, forward direction, battle command, and guarantee of victory. In the past few months, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, has seen a great situation, getting better and better. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, becoming a vast battlefield for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and have effectively promoted the rapid development of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation on all fronts are being carried out in depth. The development of the revolutionary situation is like a surging river, with a vibrant revolutionary scene everywhere.

Mountains are not higher than the sky, and rivers are not deeper than the sea. Chairman Mao's prestige is higher than the sky, and your kindness is deeper than the sea. I will not leave your books for a moment, nor will I leave your brilliant thoughts for a moment. I will strive to study your latest instructions without a moment's delay; model the execution of your latest instructions without the slightest deviation; enthusiastically propagate your latest instructions without a moment's pause; bravely defend your latest instructions with unwavering determination. I am determined to advance bravely along the direction you point out, and strive to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    心中升起永远不落的红太阳
    总后勤部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表　年四旺
    金色的太阳升起在东方，光芒万丈。革命战士的红心在激烈地跳荡，无限幸福，无限荣光。全世界革命人民最伟大的领袖，我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席接见了我们出席总后勤部第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的全体同志。千言万语涌心头，激情满怀喜泪流。我一千遍一万遍地纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”我一次又一次地衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    去年十月一日，在庄严雄伟的天安门城楼上，我第一次光荣地见到了我们最伟大的统帅毛主席，实现了我一生最大最大的愿望。一月二十六日，我又一次见到了毛主席。在短短的几个月里，我两次见到了毛主席，这是对我最大最大的关怀，最大最大的鼓舞，最大最大的鞭策，也是我一生最大最大的幸福，最大最大的光荣。
    一九六七年国庆节那天，我幸福地站在毛主席的身边，亲自听到毛主席的亲密战友林副主席传达了毛主席的最新指示：要斗私，批修。这是多么激动人心、多么伟大的纲领啊！我从自己的成长中，亲身体会到：要成为一个无产阶级革命战士，要保证我们的国家永远不改变颜色，要挖掉修正主义根子，就要不断破私立公，不断地进行世界观的彻底改造。
    只有不断地向“私”字展开进攻战，才可能在党和人民需要我们牺牲自己的利益、包括自己的生命的时候，脸不变色，心不跳，勇往直前。只有不断在灵魂深处爆发革命，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，才可能在思想上筑起一道“公”字的长城。我一定要把对“私”字的仇恨搞得深深的，把斗私的自觉性提得高高的，把斗私批修的劲头鼓得足足的，当斗私的先锋、批修的闯将，斗一辈子“私”字，批一辈子“修”字，将革命进行到底。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是全世界革命人民最伟大的舵手，按照您指引的航向，就会永远从胜利走向胜利！去年国庆节前夕，您老人家亲自视察了华北、中南和华东地区，作了一系列的最新指示。东风万里传喜讯，最新指示传四方，红太阳的光辉照遍五湖四海，指路的明灯照得我们心明眼亮。伟大的真理，前进的方向，战斗的号令，胜利的保障。几个月来，全国的无产阶级文化大革命在毛主席最新指示的指引下，形势一片大好，越来越好。毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，成为“斗私，批修”的广阔战场，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合的迅速发展。革命的大批判和各条战线的斗批改正在深入展开。革命形势的发展如江河奔泻，到处是蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    山高高不过蓝天，河深深不过海洋。毛主席您老人家的威望比天高，您老人家的恩情比海深。我要一时一刻不离您的书，一时一刻不离您的光辉思想。努力学习您的最新指示，一分一秒不放松；模范执行您的最新指示，一丝一毫不走样；热情宣传您的最新指示，一时一刻不停息；勇敢捍卫您的最新指示，一心一意不动摇。我决心坚定地沿着您老人家指引的航向奋勇前进，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底而努力奋斗。
