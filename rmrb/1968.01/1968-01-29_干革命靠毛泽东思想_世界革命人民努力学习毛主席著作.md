Rely on Mao Zedong Thought for Revolution
World Revolutionary People Strive to Study Chairman Mao's Works
Follow Chairman Mao's Teachings to Make Revolution

In the liberated area of Khammouane, Laos, there is an old guerrilla fighter in his sixties. One day, he happily obtained a book by Chairman Mao. As soon as he got the book, he eagerly started reading it. At that time, the weather was very cold, and he lived in a cold cave. However, this old guerrilla fighter had already forgotten about the cold and other things, fully concentrating on reading Chairman Mao's book. He read and read, and even when the quilt he was wearing for warmth fell off, he didn't notice. After finishing the book in one breath, he felt full of strength. He told others, "We Lao people must completely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to make revolution, and the revolution will definitely succeed!"

Mao Zedong Thought Inspires the Struggle of the Arab People

A Palestinian guerrilla fighter, during a heroic battle against the enemy, was martyred. His comrades found a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on his body.

Many Arabs often discuss this with Chinese friends visiting Arab countries. They say that Chairman Mao's works have had a tremendous impact on the Palestinian guerrillas.

In some Arab countries, there is a meaningful street play circulating among the people. The main content of this play is: new and old colonialism collude to suppress oppressed nations and peoples, and revolutionary people unite, holding high "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wielding weapons, defeating new and old colonialism. Some Arab friends pointed out that this street play powerfully reveals the truth: oppressed nations and peoples can only be armed with Mao Zedong Thought to carry out armed revolution, so as to completely liberate themselves from the slavery of imperialism and colonialism.

Follow the Path of the Chinese People

A Pakistani family tutor happily obtained a few books by Chairman Mao. He treasures these red books as family heirlooms. He reads them every day, sometimes even reading until late at night. After finishing reading, he passes the precious books to his son and daughter, instructing the children to study them seriously. Later, he lends the precious books to friends and relatives to read. Since studying Chairman Mao's works, this tutor feels that he stands taller and sees farther than before. He told a friend, "Chairman Mao is the greatest person in the world. People around the world should follow the path of the Chinese people."

The Strongest Ideological Weapon Against Imperialism and Revisionism

A friend from Morocco received a long-awaited copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" sent by a Chinese friend, and he was overjoyed. He said, "This is the greatest happiness of my life. For me, this day is happier than any other festival. This is my happiest day."

For this, he excitedly wrote a letter to the Chinese friend, expressing his deepest love for Chairman Mao.

The letter said: Chairman Mao is your great leader, and he is also our great leader. Chairman Mao is the helmsman of the world revolution, a brilliant and ever-shining red sun. His brilliance illuminates the path of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon in the arsenal of revolutionary people fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism.

Long Live the Brilliant "Three Articles"!

A Brazilian friend, after listening to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's brilliant works "The Three Articles" by Beijing Radio, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live 'The Three Articles'!" He also wrote a passionate letter to Beijing Radio, expressing congratulations and thanks. The letter pointed out that the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" "has given great encouragement to revolutionary people all over the world." Chairman Mao praised the people's soldier Zhang Zedong in this article, who "has set a great example and made great contributions to the world revolutionary cause."

He said in the letter that all revolutionaries who have listened to Chairman Mao's brilliant article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" "unanimously shout 'Long live!'"

He also said in the letter that Chairman Mao's great work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" "has given great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world who are fighting against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries." Chairman Mao pointed out: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we shall win victory." This greatly encouraged the revolutionary people to sweep away all ghosts and monsters and to seize power.

We Also Want to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works

A group of Swedish progressive youth who visited China often wear green clothes and pin shiny Mao badges on their hats. They told their friends: "The first Chinese sentence we learned in China is: 'Long live Chairman Mao!' The first Chinese song we learned is: 'The East Is Red.' The deepest and most important impression we had during our visit to China is: Chairman Mao is the great leader of all people in the world, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. We also want to study and apply Chairman Mao's works like the Chinese people, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our revolutionary struggle."

    干革命靠毛泽东思想
    世界革命人民努力学习毛主席著作
    照毛主席教导闹革命
    老挝川圹解放区有位六十多岁的老游击队员，有一天喜获一本毛主席的书。他一拿到书，就迫不及待地读了起来。当时，天气很冷，他住在一个寒气袭人的山洞里。可是这位老游击队员早已忘掉了寒冷，忘掉了别的事情，全神贯注地阅读起毛主席的书来。他读着，读着，连披在身上御寒的棉毛毯掉了下来，也没有感觉到。他一口气把书读完后，便感到浑身都充满了力量。他对别人说：“我们老挝人民要完全按照毛主席的教导去闹革命，革命一定成功！”
  毛泽东思想鼓舞阿拉伯人民斗争
    巴勒斯坦有位游击战士，在一次同敌人英勇战斗中光荣牺牲。他的战友从他的身上发现了一本《毛主席语录》。
    许多阿拉伯人常常同访问阿拉伯国家的中国朋友谈起这件事。他们说，毛主席著作在巴勒斯坦游击队中发生了巨大影响。
    在阿拉伯的一些国家，有一出意味深长的活报剧在民间流传。这个剧的主要内容是：新老殖民主义勾结起来共同镇压被压迫民族和人民，革命的人民便团结一致，高举《毛主席语录》，手执武器，打倒了新老殖民主义。阿拉伯的一些朋友指出，这出活报剧有力地揭示了这样的真理：被压迫民族和人民只有用毛泽东思想武装起来进行武装革命，才能使自己从帝国主义和殖民主义的奴役下彻底解放出来。
      走中国人民的道路
    巴基斯坦一位家庭教员，喜获几本毛主席著作。他把这些红书当作传家宝。他天天读，有时还一直读到深夜。他读完以后，又把宝书传给了儿子和女儿，并嘱咐孩子们要认真地学。后来，他又把宝书借给亲友们阅读。这位教员自从学习了毛主席著作以后，就感到自己比以前站得高了，看得远了。他对朋友说：“毛主席是世界上最最伟大的人。世界人民都要走中国人民的道路。”
    反帝反修最强大的思想武器
    摩洛哥一位朋友接到中国朋友寄给他的一本盼望已久的《毛主席语录》，他高兴极了。他说：“这是我一生中最大的幸福。这一天，对我来说比过任何节日都要快乐。这是我最幸福的一天。”
    为此，他兴奋地写信给中国朋友，表达他对毛主席最衷心的热爱。
    信中说：毛主席是你们的伟大领袖，也是我们的伟大领袖。毛主席是世界革命的舵手，是光辉灿烂的永远不落的红太阳，他的光辉照亮了世界革命的道路。毛泽东思想是革命人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争的武器库里最强有力的思想武器。
      光辉的“老三篇”万岁！
    一位巴西朋友在收听由北京电台广播的毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”以后，激奋地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“‘老三篇’万岁！”他还写了一封热情洋溢的信给北京电台，表示祝贺和感谢。信中指出，《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作“给予全世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞”。毛主席在这篇文章中赞扬的人民子弟兵张思德同志，“为世界革命事业作出了伟大榜样和贡献。”
    他在信中说，凡是收听过毛主席的天才文章《纪念白求恩》的革命者，“都异口同声地高呼‘万岁！’”。
    他在信中还说，毛主席的伟大著作《愚公移山》，“给予正在为反对帝国主义和各国反动派而斗争的世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞。毛主席指出：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’这大大鼓舞了革命人民去横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，和夺取政权的勇气。”
    我们也要活学活用毛主席著作
    一批访问过中国的瑞典进步青年，常常穿起绿色服装，把金光闪闪的毛主席像章佩戴在帽子上。他们对好友们说：“我们到中国学会的第一句中国话是：‘毛主席万岁！’学会的第一首中国歌曲是：《东方红》。我们访问中国时最大、最深刻、最重要的体会是：毛主席是全世界人民的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马列主义。我们也要象中国人民那样活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来指导我们的革命斗争。”
