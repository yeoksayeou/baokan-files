The Indian reactionary government's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi hates and fears the Indian people's struggle against tyranny to the point of madness.

Indira Gandhi, out of fear of the people's resistance, once hid in the capital New Delhi for a period and dared not go out. Now, she has started to nervously venture out to other places. On the 3rd, she went to a university in Benares, Uttar Pradesh, to speak at a scientific conference. To ensure the safety of the Prime Minister's visit, the Benares municipal authorities took "special security measures," including deploying over 3,000 police officers to strictly guard various locations throughout the city.

At the same time, the reactionary police arrested about twenty political and student leaders in the city to prevent them from organizing demonstrations against the reactionary government.

After taking these measures, Indira Gandhi still feared that the masses would stage demonstrations. Therefore, when she traveled from the Benares airport to the university, she did not dare to take a car but instead took a helicopter.

In late December of last year, Indira Gandhi went to the so-called "North-East Frontier Agency" (in the illegally occupied Chinese territory south of the "McMahon Line" by the Indian government) to boost the morale of the Indian invasion forces who were forced to fight for the Indian reactionaries. The Indian reactionary government imposed strict news blackouts for her visit, not allowing journalists to report, and all relevant information had to be released by the Indian reactionary government.

Previously, on December 24, when Indira Gandhi was active in Santiniketan, West Bengal, she narrowly escaped being killed by a bomb thrown at her by the crowd.

    成天提心吊胆不敢公开外出活动生怕丢掉性命
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府的总理英迪拉·甘地对印度人民反抗暴政的斗争恨得要死，怕得要命。
    英迪拉·甘地由于害怕人民反抗，曾经有一段期间躲在首都新德里不敢外出。现在，她开始提心吊胆地到外地活动了。她在三日到北方邦贝拿勒斯的一所大学去向一个科学会议讲了话。为了这个总理的到来，贝拿勒斯市政当局采取了“特别的保安措施”，其中包括出动三千多名警察在市内各地严密布防。
    同时，反动警察在市内逮捕了大约二十名政界和学生领袖，防止他们组织反对反动政府的示威。
    在采取了这些措施以后，英迪拉·甘地仍然害怕人民群众举行示威，因此她从贝拿勒斯飞机场到那所大学去的时候，连汽车也不敢坐，而坐了直升飞机。
    英迪拉·甘地在去年十二月下旬到所谓“东北边境特区”（在非法的“麦克马洪线”以南被印度政府强占的中国领土）去，向当地被迫为印度反动派卖命的印度侵略军打气。印度反动政府为她此行采取了严格的新闻封锁，不许新闻记者采访，有关的一切消息都要由印度反动政府发布。
    在这以前，英迪拉·甘地十二月二十四日在西孟加拉邦山提尼克坦城活动时，差一点被群众扔向她的一枚炸弹炸死。
