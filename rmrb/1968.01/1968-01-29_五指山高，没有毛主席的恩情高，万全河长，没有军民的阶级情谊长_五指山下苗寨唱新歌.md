	“Five-Finger Mountain is high, but the grace of Chairman Mao is higher. The Wanquan River is long, but the class friendship between soldiers and civilians is longer.”
	The New Song of the Miao Village Under Five-Finger Mountain

	Under Five-Finger Mountain, there is a Miao village with twenty-four households. Every morning, after the deer-skin drum in the village beats, the Miao children happily put on their schoolbags and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations as they go to school.

	This school is the first in the history of this Miao village. It was established with the help of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

	A company from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was transferred to the vicinity of this Miao village under Five-Finger Mountain. The company's party branch often organized soldiers to visit the Miao families and inquire about their hardships. One day, Li Shunzhi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, saw that some community members used corn kernels in bamboo tubes as a primitive method to record work points. This deeply moved him. That night, he couldn't fall asleep for a long time. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades, no matter where they go, must get along well with the masses, care for the masses, and help them solve their difficulties." Yes, we must help the Miao compatriots solve the problem of lacking culture.

	The next day, Li Shunzhi shared his thoughts with the political instructor. After the party branch's discussion, it was decided to help the Miao people establish a school. After hearing the news, the soldiers eagerly used their free time to make desks and chairs; they also cut thatch and built a new school building. They also donated many copies of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, and selected two model soldiers to serve as teachers. In this way, the first school was established in the deep mountains of Five-Finger Mountain.

	Since then, the company's comrades, regardless of weather, have used Chairman Mao's books as the basic textbooks and helped them learn culture, gradually changing the Miao people's previous backward methods of recording events. Now, the students trained in this school have become village study group leaders for Chairman Mao's works, accountants for production teams, and even militia squad leaders.

	The Miao people of this village enthusiastically praise the People's Liberation Army: “Five-Finger Mountain is high, but the grace of Chairman Mao is higher. The Wanquan River is long, but the class friendship between soldiers and civilians is longer.”

    “五指山高，没有毛主席的恩情高，万全河长，没有军民的阶级情谊长”
    五指山下苗寨唱新歌
    在五指山下，有一个二十四户人家的苗寨。每天清晨，寨里的鹿皮鼓响过以后，苗家的孩子们就高兴地背着书包，唱着毛主席语录歌来到学校。
    这个学校，是这个苗家寨子历史上的第一所学校，它是在解放军同志的帮助下创办起来的。
    解放军某部的一个连队，移防来到了五指山下的这个苗寨附近，连队党支部经常组织战士到苗家访贫问苦。一天，学习毛主席著作积极分子李顺智，看到有的社员用苞米粒放进竹筒这个原始方法在记工分，思想受到很大震动。晚上，他久久不能入睡，他想起毛主席的教导：“我们的同志不论到什么地方，都要和群众的关系搞好，要关心群众，帮助他们解决困难。”对，一定要帮助苗族同胞解决缺少文化的困难。
    第二天，李顺智把自己的心事，告诉了指导员。党支部经过研究，决定帮助苗胞办学校。战士们知道这个消息以后，纷纷利用休息时间，赶做了桌子、板凳；还割了茅草，盖起了一座新校舍。大家还送了许多“老三篇”和毛主席著作单行本，选了两名五好战士担任教师。就这样，这座五指山深处的苗寨里建立起了第一所学校。
    从此，连队的同志们风雨无阻，把毛主席的书当基本课本，并帮助他们学习文化，使苗胞们逐渐改变了过去那种落后的记事方法。现在，这所学校里培养出来的学生，有的已经成为村里学习毛主席著作的辅导员，有的担任了生产队的会计，还有的当了民兵排长。
    这个苗寨的苗胞们，热情地颂扬解放军：“五指山高，没有毛主席的恩情高，万全河长，没有军民的阶级情谊长。”
