The red sun's rays shine across the globe.
Long live Chairman Mao!
A Moroccan merchant ship, laden with Chinese goods, is about to set sail on a distant voyage.

On board, a sailor named Abuji pulled me, the inspection officer, close and, looking at the Mao Zedong badge on my chest and then at his own, exclaimed excitedly, "Mao Zedong is good! Mao Zedong is great!"

Abuji rushed to his room and brought out a delicate box containing over a hundred Mao Zedong badges. He pointed at the badges and said, "These are the most precious gifts from the Chinese people. I will take the Mao Zedong badges to Morocco and give them to my friends. The Moroccan people love Chairman Mao very much. The Moroccan people will forever be friends with the Chinese people."

He then took a paintbrush, dipped it in red paint, and wrote in Chinese on the iron plate near his room, "Long live Chairman Mao!" This was something he had learned in a Chinese port.

Abuji said, "I will write 'Long live Chairman Mao!' on this iron plate. The wind cannot blow it away, and the sea cannot wash it away. Our ship will take more than a month to complete its voyage, passing through many ports. Every time we stop at a port, I will teach the people there to recognize these words. Let them know the meaning of these five words, and I will shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' with them."

Give me another one!
A Cuban merchant ship arrived in Shanghai from Africa. The border inspection officer boarded the ship, and the Cuban sailors rushed over, asking for copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." A short Cuban sailor, unable to push his way through the crowd, stretched out his hand and shouted, "Give me the treasure book! Give me the treasure book!"

The inspection officer fulfilled the Cuban sailors' request. After each of them received a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," they pressed the books tightly to their chests and shouted in unison, "Mao Zedong! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

The short Cuban sailor pushed his way out of the crowd again and approached the inspection officer, saying, "Please give me another one. When our ship passes through African ports, an African dock worker asked me to get a copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong' for him when I reached a Chinese port, and bring it back when the ship returns."

The sailor took two copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," one in Spanish and one in Swahili, and happily returned to his cabin.

An Italian Sailor's Wish
One day, an Italian sailor named Antonio, who had come from the port of Genoa, handed over his passport to the Chinese border inspection officer for verification. He then refused to leave, staring intently at the officer's chest. It turned out that the inspection officer was wearing a shiny gold Mao Zedong badge with Mao in military uniform.

Antonio gave a thumbs up and said, "Mao Zedong, the Lenin of our time. I think of Mao Zedong day and night. In the vast ocean, when I think of the great helmsman Mao Zedong, I find my direction."

The inspection officer understood the sailor's feelings and immediately took off his own Mao Zedong badge, intending to pin it on the sailor's chest. Antonio suddenly stepped back. He went to one side, took off his paint-stained work clothes, and placed them on the railing. He was wearing a clean light blue shirt and stood at attention in front of the inspection officer, saying solemnly, "Please don't pin it on my new clothes."

The inspection officer pinned the Mao Zedong badge on his chest, and he grasped the inspection officer's hands tightly, saying, "Thank you. This way, I can see the great teacher of the world's peoples, Chairman Mao, every day." Then, he excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

A Precious Photograph
An elderly Arab sailor will be leaving China in a day. Thinking of the warm reception he received from his Chinese friends, he decided to give a gift to his Chinese friend before the ship leaves China.

The old sailor took out a family photo from his room and introduced it to the inspection officer: The three children sitting on the floor in the first row are his two granddaughters and one grandson. The couple sitting in the middle are he and his wife. The third row consists of his son and daughter-in-law. In the photo, all seven family members are holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in their right hands and Mao Zedong portraits in their left hands, and the entire photo is filled with a happy atmosphere. The old sailor said, "My family took this photo to express our love for the great leader Mao Zedong."

The old sailor finally hoped that the inspection officer would give him seven Mao Zedong badges. The inspection officer understood his feelings and immediately took out seven Mao Zedong badges, pinning one on the old sailor's chest and placing the remaining six in the old sailor's hand.

The old sailor took the Mao Zedong badges and said emotionally, "Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Arab people. We Arab people love Chairman Mao. With the Mao Zedong badge on, I feel that Chairman Mao is with our family and in the hearts of the Arab people."

Mao Zedong is the Great Savior of the People
On a sunny day, the inspection officer was on duty on a Greek ship. A Greek sailor in his fifties, named Lobonis, invited the inspection officer to his room.

There was a portrait of Chairman Mao in the room. Lobonis said, "China is good! Mao Zedong is good! China has become the revolutionary center that the world's people yearn for. I firmly believe that the people of the whole world want liberation and must follow the path of China, the path of Mao Zedong."

At this point, Lobonis asked the inspection officer to teach him to sing "The East Is Red" in Chinese. The inspection officer taught him, and he sang it seriously for more than ten times, finally learning it. He said happily, "I will sing this song to every corner of the world, so that all the people of the world know: China has produced a Mao Zedong, he is the great savior of the people."

    红太阳光芒照全球
    毛主席万岁！
    一艘摩洛哥商轮，满载着中国货物，将要启碇远航。
    船上一位叫阿步地的摩洛哥水手，拉着我检查员的手，看着检查员胸前的毛主席像章，又看看自己胸前的毛主席像章，激动地说：“毛泽东好！毛泽东伟大！”
    阿步地跑到自己房间里，拿出一个精巧的盒子，里面珍藏着一百多枚毛主席像章，他指指像章说：“这是中国人民给我们的最珍贵的礼物，我要把毛主席像章带到摩洛哥去，送给我的朋友。摩洛哥人民非常热爱毛主席，摩洛哥人民永远和中国人民友好。”
    讲到这里，阿步地随手拿来一只油漆刷子，蘸上红漆，在靠近他房间的铁板上，用中文写了五个字：“毛主席万岁！”这是他在中国港口学会的。
    阿步地说：“我把‘毛主席万岁！’这几个字写在铁板上，大风刮不掉，海水冲不掉。我们的船航程需要一个多月时间，途中要经过许多港口。每停靠一个港口，我就教那里的人民认这几个字。让他们知道这五个字的意思，我要和他们一起高呼‘毛主席万岁！’”
    再　给　我　一　本！
    一艘古巴商轮从非洲来到上海港。我边防检查员登上船，古巴海员就涌上来，向检查员索取《毛主席语录》。有个古巴海员，个子矮小，几次挤不进人群，急得伸手直喊：“给我宝书！给我宝书！”
    检查员满足了古巴海员们的要求。他们每人得到了一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》后，将宝书紧紧贴在胸上，齐声高呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东主席万岁！”
    那个矮小的古巴海员又从人群中挤出来，走近检查员说：“请再给我一本。我们的船经非洲港口，非洲一码头工人要我到了中国港时，代他要一本《毛主席语录》，待船回去时带给他。”
    这位水手拿着两本《毛主席语录》，一本西班牙文版和一本斯瓦西里文版，兴高采烈地回房舱去了。
    一位意大利海员的心愿
    一天，一位名叫安东尼的意大利海员，他是从热那亚港口来的。他向中国边防检查员交验了护照，就不愿离开，瞪大着眼睛，一直注视着检查员胸前。原来，这位检查员今天佩戴上了一枚金光闪闪的毛主席身穿军装的像章。
    安东尼翘起大拇指说：“毛泽东，当代的列宁，我日夜想念毛泽东。在茫茫大海中，我想起伟大舵手毛主席，我就有了前进的方向。”
    检查员理解这位海员的心情，马上摘下自己胸前的毛主席像章，要把像章别到那位海员胸前，安东尼突然闪开了。他走到一旁，脱下沾满油漆的工作服，放在栏杆上。他身上穿着一件清洁的浅蓝色的衬衣，立正站在检查员面前庄严地说：“请别在我的新衣服上。”
    检查员把毛主席像章别在他胸前，他双手紧握检查员的手说：“谢谢您。这样，我每天能见到世界人民伟大导师毛主席。”然后，他激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    一张珍贵的照片
    一位阿拉伯老水手再有一天就要离开中国返航了。他想到中国朋友对他热情接待，在船离开中国前，准备送一件礼物给他的中国朋友。
    老水手从房间拿出一张他全家的合照，向检查员介绍说：第一排坐在地板上的三个小孩，两个是他的孙女，一个是他的孙子，坐在中间的是他和他的妻子，第三排站着的是他的儿子和儿媳妇。照片上一家大小七口人，右手都拿着《毛主席语录》，左手都拿着毛主席像片，整个照片充满着幸福的气氛。老水手说：“我一家人为了表达对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，拍了这张照片。”
    老水手最后希望检查员给他七枚毛主席像章。检查员理解他的心情，随即拿出七枚毛主席像章，把一枚先别在老水手胸前，其余六枚放在老水手的手里。
    这位老水手接过毛主席像章，感动地说：
  “毛泽东不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是阿拉伯人民的伟大领袖。我们阿拉伯人民热爱毛主席，我戴上了毛主席像章，感觉到毛主席就在我们一家人身边，在我们阿拉伯人民心中。”
    毛泽东是人民的大救星
    一个风和日丽的日子，检查员在一条希腊船上执行任务。一位五十多岁的希腊老船员罗波尼士请检查员到他房间去。
    房间里摆着一幅毛主席像。罗波尼士说：
  “中国好！毛泽东好！中国已成为世界人民向往的革命中心。我深信，全世界人民要解放，就要走中国的道路，走毛泽东的道路。”
    说到这里，罗波尼士请检查员用中文教他唱《东方红》。检查员教他唱，他认真地学唱了十几遍，终于学会了。他高兴地说：“我要把这支歌，唱到世界每个角落，让全世界人民知道：中国出了个毛泽东，他是人民的大救星。”
