Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

We, the proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu who are eternally loyal to you, are filled with boundless excitement and joy as we report to you, our most red and radiant sun, the news of our victory: the Gansu Revolutionary Committee has been born triumphantly under your latest instructions, facing the brilliant morning sun of the East!

This is another great victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat on the highlands of the Northwest!

This is another rich fruit of the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

This is another great achievement of the People's Liberation Army of China in their "three supports, two military" work!

We cheer, we sing, celebrating the great victory of your brilliant thoughts, singing the triumphant song of your revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, we proletarian revolutionaries miss you more than ever! We have so many heartfelt words to say to you, and so many passionate songs to sing to you. Countless words cannot express our boundless love for you; countless songs cannot express our boundless admiration for you. Countless words and countless songs condense into one most beautiful wish: we wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, the mountains and rivers of Gansu are more magnificent than ever! Looking at today, the revolutionary thunder roars; recalling the past, the years are full of ups and downs. On this day of great joy and celebration, how can we forget the countless mountains and rivers you led us across, how can we forget the vast and tumultuous battle journey!

The endless snowfields of Min Mountains bear the deep footprints of your Long March!

The deep valleys of La Zi Pass echo your stirring orders to advance!

The lights of Ha Da Pu still shine in the hearts of the people of Gansu!

The triumphant songs of the Red Army's reunification still resonate in the streets of Wulian!

Your brilliant thoughts illuminate the heavens and earth of Gansu, and your great image will forever be in the hearts of the people of Gansu!

Thirty-three years ago, you led the Red Army on the world-shaking Long March of 25,000 li. Today, you are leading us in an unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

It is you, the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," that sounded the battle cry for our fierce attack on the handful of Wang Feng!

It is you who personally launched the "January Revolution" storm, inspiring us to smash the Wang family's black den!

It is you, the highest directive to solve the problems of Gansu, that illuminated the bright future of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Gansu!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who, in the most difficult times, cleared away the layers of mist for us; it is you who, in the most critical moments, helped us withstand the gusts of evil winds; it is you who, hacking through the brambles, opened the way for us; it is you who, steering the ship, corrected our course.

Countless times of life-and-death trials, countless twists and turns of arduous struggles, countless nights of stormy weather, countless dawns of radiant glory, we think of you day and night, great leader Mao Zedong! Thinking of you, our hearts burn with passion and our will is firm; thinking of you, our spirits soar and our direction is clear; thinking of you, we fear no thousand difficulties and ten thousand dangers; thinking of you, we remain composed even as the clouds fly in disorder!

Good news from Beijing, good tidings from Zhongnanhai. On August 5, 1967, your highest directive to solve the problems of Gansu came! Under the Gaolan Mountains, red flags rise in a thousand waves; along the banks of the Yellow River, songs merge into a vast sea. We cheer, we leap, our hearts surge, our blood boils. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! This is your greatest support, greatest encouragement, greatest trust, and greatest spur to us, the proletarian revolutionaries and people of all ethnic groups in Gansu! This is your greatest affirmation of the "three supports, two military" work of the People's Liberation Army! Your highest directive expresses your boundless concern for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Gansu!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Turning the pages of the history of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Gansu, every chapter shines with the brilliant light of your thoughts, every paragraph sings the victory song of your revolutionary line, every page is soaked with the sweat of your labor for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Gansu, and every word contains your boundless concern for the proletarian revolutionaries in Gansu!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest series of directives is our highest guideline for action, and your highest directive to solve the problems of Gansu is our guiding light for progress! Our boundless loyalty to you, our unwavering follow-through of your great strategic deployment. We have fought against the handful of Wang Feng, we have achieved revolutionary unity. We have gone through the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution in Gansu with a fighting attitude, and we eagerly await the birth of the Gansu Revolutionary Committee with excited hearts.

This day has finally come! The Qilian Mountains are laughing, the White Dragon River is boiling, the Gansu Revolutionary Committee is established!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will hold high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts; we will resolutely follow the revolutionary path you have shown us. The history of Gansu's revolution will be written by us, and we will build the socialist edifice of Gansu with our own hands!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts are our guiding light for progress; your brilliant thoughts are our weapons for battle. We will read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, and act according to your directives for a lifetime. We will engrave your brilliant thoughts in our minds and put them into action. We will make the sky of Gansu a place where Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly; we will make the land of Gansu a place where Mao Zedong Thought shines universally; we will make the people of Gansu people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We will make the banner of your brilliant thoughts fly forever in the sky of Gansu for thousands of years!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We, the proletarian revolutionaries of Gansu, will study diligently the "Old Five Articles" and your latest series of directives, and vow to be the vanguards of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. We will overthrow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois cliques, strengthen proletarian party spirit, seize the power of selfishness, and govern selfishness. We will uproot the foundation of selfishness in our minds and build a great wall of public spirit. We will criticize the Chinese Khrushchev more thoroughly than Trotsky was criticized in his time, and we will overthrow and criticize the handful of Wang Feng, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Gansu Province.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will raise higher the banner of "Support the Army and Love the People." We and the army stand shoulder to shoulder, the army and we are heart to heart; we and the army are close kin, the army is our confidant; the army loves the people, the people support the army, the army and the people are united as one!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will follow your great strategic deployment to make the revolution. We will consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and we will do a good job of struggle, criticism, and reform in our units. We will rectify the party organization and strengthen party building. We will grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness. We have the determination and perseverance to achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will follow your great teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and vow to defend your proletarian revolutionary line and the newly born revolutionary committee to the death.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The proletarian revolutionaries will forever be loyal to you! With the water of the East China Sea and the clouds of the blue sky, we cannot express our boundless love and admiration for you, our boundless faith and loyalty! We will fight to defend you in life, and we will die to defend you. To defend you, we will dye the revolutionary flag with our blood, and offer our lives to Chairman Mao! To defend you, we will dare to climb the mountain of knives; to defend you, we will dare to charge through the sea of fire. Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our red hearts loyal to your brilliant thoughts will never change; even if the earth quakes and the mountains shake, we will hold high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts and never waver!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Gazing at your benevolent face, holding high your red book, touching the glorious flag, recalling the long battle journey, a million hearts beat fiercely, a million smiling faces turn to the red sun. Most respected and beloved Chairman Mao, we sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

      这是西北高原无产阶级文化大革命的又一次大捷！
      这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的又一丰硕成果！
      这是伟大的中国人民解放军在“三支”　“两军”工作中创建的又一丰功伟绩！
      我们欢呼，我们歌唱，欢呼您光辉思想的伟大胜利，歌唱您革命路线的胜利凯歌！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！今天，我们无产阶级革命派格外想念您！我们有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲，我们有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱。千言万语，说不尽我们对您老人家的无限热爱；千歌万曲，唱不完我们对您老人家的无限敬仰。千言万语，千歌万曲，凝结成一句最美好的祝愿：祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！

      哈达铺的灯光啊，如今依然照耀着甘肃人民的心田！
      红军会师的凯歌啊，如今依然在会宁城下荡漾！
      您那光辉的思想，照亮了甘肃的天地山河，您那伟大的形象，永远留在甘肃人民的心坎上！
      三十三年前，您率领着红军举行了震撼世界的二万五千里长征。今天啊，您又带领着我们进行了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命！
      是您，《炮打司令部》的大字报，吹响了我们向汪锋一小撮猛烈进攻的战斗号角！
      是您，亲自发动的“一月革命”风暴，鼓舞着我们砸烂了汪家黑店！
      是您，解决甘肃问题的最高指示，照亮了甘肃无产阶级文化大革命的锦绣前程！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，在最困难的时候，给我们拨开了层层迷雾；是您，在最严重的关头，给我们顶住了阵阵妖风；是您，披荆斩棘，给我们开辟道路；是您，力挽狂澜，给我们拨正船头。
      多少次出生入死的考验，多少回艰苦曲折的斗争，多少个风雨交加的夜晚，多少个光辉灿烂的黎明，我们日夜想念您啊，伟大的领袖毛泽东！想起您，心红眼亮意志坚；想起您，志高胆大方向明；想起您，千难万险无惧色；想起您，“乱云飞渡仍从容”！
      北京城里报喜讯，中南海内传佳音。一九六七年八月五日，您老人家解决甘肃问题的最高指示传来了！皋兰山下，红旗卷起千重浪；黄河两岸，歌声汇成万顷波。我们欢呼，我们跳跃，我们心潮澎湃，我们热血沸腾。毛主席啊，毛主席！这是您对我们甘肃无产阶级革命派和各族人民的最大支持，最大鼓舞，最大信任，最大鞭策！这是您对人民解放军“三支”“两军”工作的最大肯定！您的最高指示，表达了您对甘肃无产阶级文化大革命的无限关心！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！翻开甘肃无产阶级文化大革命的斗争史册，那一章不闪耀着您光辉思想的万丈光芒，那一篇不谱写着您革命路线的胜利赞歌，那一页不渗透着您为甘肃无产阶级文化大革命操劳的心血，那一字不包含着您对甘肃无产阶级革命派的无限关切！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您的一系列最新指示是我们行动的最高纲领，您关于甘肃问题的最高指示是我们前进的指路明灯！我们对您老人家无限无限的忠诚，对您的伟大战略部署一步不离地紧跟。我们狠斗了汪锋一小撮，我们实现了革命大联合。我们以战斗的姿态度过了甘肃文化大革命的峥嵘岁月，我们以激动的心情盼望着甘肃省革命委员会的诞生。
      这一天终于来到了！祁连山在欢笑，白龙江在沸腾，甘肃省革命委员会成立了！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您光辉思想的伟大红旗，我们要高举更高举；您指引的革命道路，我们要坚决走到底。甘肃的革命历史将由我们来谱写，甘肃省社会主义大厦我们双手建！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您光辉的思想，是我们前进的灯塔；您光辉的思想，是我们战斗的武器。我们一定要一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事。把您的光辉思想刻印在脑海里，落实在行动上。我们要让甘肃的天，成为毛泽东思想光辉灿烂的天；让甘肃的地，成为毛泽东思想阳光普照的地；让甘肃的人，是毛泽东思想武装起来的人！我们要让您光辉思想的旗帜，千秋万代，永远飘扬在甘肃的上空！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们甘肃无产阶级革命派要刻苦地学习“老五篇”和您的一系列最新指示，誓作斗私的闯将，批修的先锋。我们要打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，我们要夺“私”字的权，专“私”字的政，挖掉头脑里“私”字的根基，筑起“公”字的长城。我们要把中国的赫鲁晓夫批得比当年的托洛茨基还臭，我们要把中国赫鲁晓夫在甘肃省的代理人汪锋一小撮斗倒、斗臭。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们要更高地举起“拥军爱民”的大旗。我们和解放军肩并肩，解放军和我们心连心；我们和解放军是亲骨肉，解放军是我们贴心人；军爱民，民拥军，军民团结如一人！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们要紧跟您的伟大战略部署闹革命。我们要巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，我们要搞好本单位的斗、批、改。我们要整顿好党的组织，加强党的建设。我们要狠抓革命、猛促生产、猛促工作、猛促战备。我们有决心、有毅力，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们要遵循您的伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，誓死保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫新诞生的革命委员会。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！无产阶级革命派永远忠于您！蘸尽东海万顷水，写满蓝天千里云，写不尽我们对您的无限热爱，无限崇拜！表达不尽我们对您的无限信仰，无限忠心！我们生为捍卫您而战斗，死为捍卫您而献身。为捍卫您，鲜血染红革命旗，生命献给毛主席！为捍卫您，我们刀山敢上；为捍卫您，我们火海敢闯。海枯石烂，我们忠于您光辉思想的红心永不变，地动山摇，我们高举您光辉思想的伟大红旗不动摇！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！仰望您慈祥的面孔，高举起您红彤彤的宝书，抚摸那光荣的战旗，回顾那漫长的战斗里程，千万颗红心激烈地跳动，千万张笑脸迎着红太阳。最最敬爱的毛主席啊，我们衷心祝愿您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
          甘肃省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
