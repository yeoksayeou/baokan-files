The Lao People's Liberation Army High Command, Kaysone Phomvihane, issued an order to the entire army on the 19th anniversary of the Lao People's Liberation Army (January 20) calling on the main force, local forces, and guerrilla units of the People's Liberation Army to strengthen the people's war, launch continuous and proactive attacks on the enemy, remain vigilant at all times, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely smash the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism.

The order states: Under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and with the wholehearted care, nurturing, and assistance of all ethnic groups, the Lao People's Liberation Army has been tempered and grown in the crucible of revolutionary struggle. Together with all ethnic groups in the country, they have defeated French colonialism and are now defeating U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Lao People's Liberation Army has developed from small guerrilla units and weak armed propaganda teams into a powerful armed force that is loyal to the rights of all ethnic groups, fights bravely, and defeats all invaders, with an unyielding spirit to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and completes all tasks gloriously.

The order points out: Now, the Lao People's Liberation Army is stronger than ever before, with improved political awareness and tactical and technical levels.

The order states: Since the beginning of the 1967-1968 dry season, the Lao patriotic military and people have launched continuous attacks on the enemy. In the first two months of this dry season, the number of enemy casualties is equivalent to the entire dry season of 1966-1967.

The order calls on the Lao People's Liberation Army to strengthen the people's war and widely develop guerrilla warfare, launch fierce, continuous, and proactive attacks on the enemy, strengthen troop building, further cultivate the qualities of the revolutionary army, and improve tactical and technical levels. The order calls on the Lao People's Liberation Army to unite with the people, care for the people, share weal and woe with the people, and strengthen close unity with the patriotic neutral armed forces.

The order finally calls on the Lao patriotic military and people to unite as one, fear no sacrifice, advance bravely, and resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary on January 20, enthusiastically hailing the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army.

The commentary says: Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao People's Liberation Army has become a powerful force capable of defeating all wars of aggression launched by the enemy and has become an important factor in determining the final victory of the Lao revolution. The 19-year history of the Lao People's Liberation Army is a glorious history, a history of brilliant achievements. The commentary says that in this dry season, the Lao People's Liberation Army responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and carried out the instructions of the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command, bravely fighting the enemy on battlefields from the upper to the lower regions, and achieving brilliant victories in places like Nam Phao. These victories fully demonstrate the boundless power of the people's war, inflicting heavy defeats on the enemy, and bringing joy and encouragement to the Lao people. (With picture)
