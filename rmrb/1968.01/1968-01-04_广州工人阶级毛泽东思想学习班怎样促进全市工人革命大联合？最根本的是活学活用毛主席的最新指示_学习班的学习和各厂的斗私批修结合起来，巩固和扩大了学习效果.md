The Guangzhou Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combine learning with application, focusing on the "application" aspect, conducting thorough self-criticism, and fiercely battling the "self" to effectively promote the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great unity of the working class throughout the city, further improving the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The Guangzhou Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, organized by the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, have already conducted two sessions. Participants include representatives from the three revolutionary mass organizations of Guangzhou's factories and enterprises, factory-level leaders, and some PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team members stationed in the factories.

When the classes began, many students came with serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Students from different factions sat together but couldn't communicate effectively. After studying the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, especially the teachings on not always thinking one is right and believing that truth is solely in one's hands, and after recalling past sufferings, the students' class consciousness significantly improved. Through personal experiences, they thoroughly discussed the harms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, recognizing that "self" is the root of factionalism. With "self," one cannot listen to Chairman Mao's words, study Chairman Mao's works, or apply Mao Zedong Thought. Without overcoming "self," mistakes cannot be corrected, revisionism cannot be opposed, and prevention of revisionism cannot be achieved. To better overcome their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they learned from the PLA's experience, initiating "one helps one" and "one pair of red" activities. Many people voluntarily paired up with opponents to jointly formulate study plans, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, recall class struggles, learn from each other, help each other, and improve together. Especially by consciously discussing their own shortcomings, learning from each other's strengths, actively seeking each other's opinions, and achieving mutual understanding and help. In this way, relationships improved, and both sides could openly express their thoughts. They said, "A year without seeing each other's thoughts, talking heart-to-heart feels especially close." They summarized four experiences of the two factions transitioning from mutual opposition to eliminating barriers and uniting in the study class: First, both sides must advocate self-revolutionary spirit, dare to self-criticize, and fiercely battle "self"; second, dare to affirm each other's achievements and fully see each other's strengths; third, seek great unity and tolerate small differences; fourth, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, eliminate societal factional interference, and act in the interests of the greater good, prioritizing revolutionary benefits. All of this, fundamentally, is to establish a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary learning style, actively applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combining learning with application, and seeing immediate results.

After effectively eliminating factionalism in the study class, the revolutionary masses of the two factions also adopted internal and external integration methods, closely linking the study class with the self-criticism and criticism of revisionism activities in various factories, consolidating and expanding the learning effects. In the second session of the study class, through internal and external integration, 22 factories and units leveled their factions and achieved revolutionary great unity, while another 16 factories and units achieved revolutionary great unity of the two major factions.

Factory-level cadre participants also studied and engaged in self-criticism with representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations, greatly promoting unity between revolutionary cadres and the masses. Many cadres, through study, corrected their attitudes towards the masses, conducted relatively profound self-examinations in the study class, and were welcomed by the masses. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, trust the masses, rely on the masses, correctly treat themselves, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, creating new merits for the people.

    广州工人阶级毛泽东思想学习班怎样促进全市工人革命大联合？
    最根本的是活学活用毛主席的最新指示
    学习班的学习和各厂的斗私批修结合起来，巩固和扩大了学习效果
    据新华社广州二日电　广州工人阶级毛泽东思想学习班，在学习毛主席的最新指示中，学用结合，在“用”字上狠下功夫，认真多做自我批评，狠斗“私”字，有力地促进了全市工人阶级革命大联合的巩固和发展，进一步改善了干部和群众的关系。
    由广东省革命委员会筹备小组主办的广州工人阶级毛泽东思想学习班，已经开办了两期。参加学习的有广州工厂企业的三大革命群众组织的负责人，厂一级领导干部和部分驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传员。
    学习班开学时，不少学员带着严重的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性来参加学习。观点不同的两派学员坐在一起，话都说不到一块。经过学习伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，特别是学习了毛主席“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了”的教导和忆苦思甜，学员们的阶级觉悟大大提高。他们通过切身体会，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害，认识到“私”字是派性的根源，有了“私”字，毛主席的话听不进，毛主席的著作学不好，毛泽东思想用不上。“私”字斗不倒，错误改不了，反修反不掉，防修防不好。为了更好地克服自己的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，他们学习解放军的经验，开展了“一帮一”、“一对红”活动。很多人主动找对方结成“一帮一”、“一对红”的“对子”，一起制订学习计划，共同斗私批修，共同忆阶级苦，互相学习，互相帮助，共同提高。特别是自觉多谈自己的缺点，多学习对方的优点，主动征求对方意见，做到互相交心，互相帮助。这样，关系融洽了，彼此就会都把心里话倾吐出来。他们说：“一年思想不见面，谈心倍感分外亲。”他们总结了两派在学习班上从互相对立到消除隔阂、团结友爱的四条经验：第一，双方要发扬自我革命精神，勇于自我批评，狠斗“私”字；第二，要敢于肯定对方成绩，充分看到对方的长处；第三，要求大同，存小异；第四，要坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，排除社会上派性的干扰，一切从顾全大局出发，以革命利益为重。而这一切，最根本的是要建立马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，对毛主席的最新指示活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影。
    两派的革命群众在学习班上有效地消除了派性后，还采取内外结合，互相促进的方法，把学习班的学习同各厂的斗私批修活动密切联系起来，巩固和扩大学习效果。在第二期学习班上，通过内外结合，有二十二个工厂和单位铲平山头，实现了革命大联合，另外有十六个工厂和单位实现了两大派的革命大联合。
    参加学习的厂级领导干部也同各革命群众组织负责人一起学习，一起斗私，大大促进了革命干部和群众的团结。很多干部通过学习，端正了对待群众的态度，在学习班上做了比较深刻的检查，受到群众欢迎。他们表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，相信群众，依靠群众，正确对待自己，紧跟毛主席闹一辈子革命，为人民立新功。
