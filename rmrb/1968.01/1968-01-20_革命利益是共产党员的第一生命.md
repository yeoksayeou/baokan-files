The revolutionary interest is the first life of a Communist Party member

Jia Jincai, Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of Dazhai Brigade

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must all have a thorough spirit of revolution." The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. From the day a Communist Party member joins the Party, he must resolve to devote his entire life to the thorough elimination of the system of exploitation and to the realization of socialism and communism.

However, China's Khrushchev shamelessly proclaims: "In the past, one could become an official by passing the imperial examinations, and now one can become an official by joining the Communist Party. Party membership is a reserve list for officials." This is a vicious slander against our broad masses of Communist Party members. I joined the Party in 1947. I joined the Party to overthrow the three big mountains, defeat the three big enemies, liberate all of China, and build a socialist and communist society; it was certainly not, as China's Khrushchev says, to become an official. I have been a Party member for twenty whole years. From the day I joined the Party, I have never left production and have persisted in working at the grassroots level to this day. If joining the Party were to become an official, then wouldn't I, at nearly sixty years old, have long since resigned from the Party?

We true Communists are absolutely not seeking office, but are seeking to build a beautiful communist society and to be genuine servants of the people. Liu Hulan joined the Party at the age of sixteen and bravely sacrificed her life in the struggle against the bandits of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. Our great leader Chairman Mao praised her: "Great in life, glorious in death." Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary interest. Is this also to become an official? No! The interest of the proletarian revolution is the first life of Communist Party members. For the revolution, Communist Party members can abandon all personal interests, including their own lives. Revolution is not afraid of death; those who are afraid of death do not make revolution. To join the Party to become an official is incompatible with the character of a true Communist Party member.

"Now that one has joined the Communist Party, one can also become an official," this is a vicious slander against our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China is the great party personally founded and nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao. Taking our Dazhai Brigade Party branch as an example, for twenty years, we have closely followed Chairman Mao, continuously made revolution, and continuously advanced, defeated the three big enemies, carried out land reform, thoroughly eliminated the system of exploitation, and realized socialist collectivization. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, the Communist Party members of our Dazhai Brigade have led the masses to struggle against nature, struggle against the earth, and struggle against class enemies, causing Dazhai to undergo a great change, transforming the old Dazhai, where people, land, and mountains were poor, into a thriving socialist new Dazhai. Can it be said that we Communist Party members are seeking office? Except for China's Khrushchev and these bad people, who doesn't know that we are seeking to build a new socialist countryside and to support national construction and the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world?

"Joining the Communist Party can also make one an official," this is a complete exposure of China's Khrushchev's wolfish ambitions. He infiltrated the Party to sabotage the Party, alter the nature of the Party, and transform our Party into the party of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, so that he could ride on the heads of the working people to become an official and a lord.

For the sake of becoming an official, he has always opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries were sharpening their knives to attack the liberated areas, but he wanted our Party to hand over the people's army to the Kuomintang, so that he could become an official in the Kuomintang reactionary government. At the same time, he shamelessly said that this was "profitable" and "worthwhile."

To join the Party to become an official and a lord, or to make revolution and be a servant of the people, this is the dividing line between a true Communist Party member and a false one.

We are Communist Party members nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We join the Party not to become officials and lords, but to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. Regarding China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of joining the Party to "become an official" and so on, we must resolutely criticize them thoroughly and stink them out, and not allow them to poison the souls of Party members.

    革命利益是共产党员的第一生命
    大寨大队贫协主任　贾进财
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神”。共产党，是无产阶级的先锋队。共产党员，从他入党的那天起，就要下定决心为彻底消灭剥削制度，实现社会主义和共产主义干一辈子革命。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却大肆叫嚷什么：“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官，这个党员就是干部的后备名单。”这完全是对我们广大共产党员的恶毒污蔑。我是一九四七年入党的，我入党是为了推翻三座大山，打倒三大敌人，解放全中国，建设社会主义和共产主义社会；根本不是象中国赫鲁晓夫说的那样，入党是为了做官。我入党已经整整二十个年头了，从入党那天起，一直没脱离过生产，在基层坚持工作到今天。要是入党就是为了做官的话，我现在年纪快到六十岁，那不是早就该退党了吗？
    我们真正的共产党人，绝对不是为了做官，而是为了建设美好的共产主义社会，作一名名副其实的人民勤务员。刘胡兰十六岁入了党，在和蒋阎匪帮作斗争时，英勇牺牲了。伟大的领袖毛主席赞扬她：“生的伟大，死的光荣”。无数革命先烈，为了革命的利益，牺牲了自己的生命，这难道也是为了做官吗？不！无产阶级革命的利益，就是我们共产党员的第一生命。为了革命，共产党员的一切个人利益都可以抛弃，包括自己的生命。革命不怕死，怕死不革命。为做官入党，这和一个真正共产党员的品质是水火不相容的。
    “现在加入了共产党，也可以做官”，这是对我们伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的恶毒诬蔑。中国共产党，是伟大的领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培育起来的。拿我们大寨大队党支部来说，二十年来，紧紧跟着毛主席，不断革命，不断前进，打倒了三大敌人，进行了土地改革，彻底消灭了剥削制度，实现了社会主义集体化。在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，我们大寨大队的共产党员，带领群众与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，使大寨起了翻天覆地的变化，把一个人穷、地穷、山穷的旧大寨，建成了一个欣欣向荣的社会主义新大寨。难道说我们这些共产党员是为了做官吗？除了中国赫鲁晓夫这些坏人以外，谁都知道，我们是为了建设社会主义的新农村，为了支援国家建设，支援世界被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    “加入了共产党，也可以做官”，正是中国赫鲁晓夫自己狼子野心的大暴露。他钻进党内是为了破坏党、篡改党的性质，想把我们党改造为地主、富农、资本家的党，他好骑在劳动人民头上做官当老爷。
    他为了做官，一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动派正在磨刀，要进攻解放区，而他却要我们党把人民的军队交给国民党，他好到国民党反动政府中去做官，同时他还不知羞耻地说什么这是“赚钱的”、“划得来”的。
    入党是为了做官当老爷，还是为革命当人民的勤务员，这是真共产党员还是假共产党员的分水岭。
    我们是毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的共产党员。我们入党决不是为了做官当老爷，而是为了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。对于中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的入党为了“做官”等等反动谬论，我们要坚决把它批透、批臭，不许它毒害党员的灵魂。
