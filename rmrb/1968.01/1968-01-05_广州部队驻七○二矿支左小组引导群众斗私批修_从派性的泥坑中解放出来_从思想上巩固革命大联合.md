The Support Left Group of the Guangzhou Military Region stationed at Mine 702, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has helped this mine achieve revolutionary unity. They have continuously guided the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and make the revolutionary unity within the mine increasingly solid. Currently, the revolutionary situation in this mine is the best it has ever been, with production booming. The annual national production plan was completed more than three months ahead of schedule.

In March of last year, after the Support Left Group entered Mine 702, they firmly responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the broad masses of the left," and through a period of patient and meticulous ideological and political work, the seven revolutionary mass organizations within the mine achieved revolutionary unity by department, workshop, and team in early May. However, because some mass organizations did not promptly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they often quarreled over non-principled issues, seriously impacting the revolutionary unity within the mine. The Support Left Group paid great attention to ideological and political work after achieving revolutionary unity, did not avoid new contradictions and problems, and insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to grasp living thoughts, guide revolutionary masses to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, overcome factionalism, and strengthen party spirit.

Not long after revolutionary unity was achieved, disagreements arose over how to carry out the Cultural Revolution within the mine. The "September 4 Revolutionary Rebel Corps," which had the most members and had emerged from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, saw some of its members' factionalism grow due to changes in their status. They advocated retaliating against those who had once surrounded them. Many masses did not agree with this. For a time, arguments continued, and contradictions intensified. Some leaders of mass organizations secretly gathered followers and established separate factions. The revolutionary unity within the mine faced the danger of splitting. The members of the Support Left Group used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation at the time, recognizing that all the strange phenomena were due to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They organized all the workers in the mine to repeatedly study "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas within the Party," guiding the two factions of revolutionary masses to recall the bitterness of the old society, denounce the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, especially linking the struggle between the two lines within the mine during the Cultural Revolution, helping the two factions of revolutionary masses find "three great similarities": first, similar love, all loving Chairman Mao, loving Mao Zedong Thought, and loving Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; second, similar hatred, all hating the old society, hating imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and hating China's Khrushchev; third, similar paths, all firmly walking the socialist road. The workers excitedly said, "All sins are the fault of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party; those who were temporarily deceived are class brothers. Although they have done some wrong things, this account should be charged to China's Khrushchev." The leaders of the "September 4 Revolutionary Rebel Corps" deeply realized through study that the root of the reactionary line is the "self," and if the "self" is not eradicated, we will also fall for the bourgeois reactionary line. He took the initiative to examine his wrongdoings towards other mass organizations at a mass meeting and had several heart-to-heart talks with those who had once opposed him, promptly eliminating misunderstandings.

In June of last year, as the Cultural Revolution within the mine deepened, new disagreements arose over the handling of cadre issues. The revolutionary unity within the mine once again faced the danger of splitting. The Support Left Group guided everyone to analyze the cadres within the mine according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Chairman Mao taught us: "Not only should we look at a cadre's momentary actions, but we should also look at a cadre's entire history and all their work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted in-depth investigations and class analyses of the cadres. After their consciousness was raised, those who had previously advocated overthrowing a large number of cadres publicly announced the withdrawal of their opinions, expressing their determination to fight against the "self," overcome factionalism, and firmly act according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Now, more than 95% of the cadres in this mine are working together with the revolutionary masses to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, grasp the revolution, and promote production, powerfully advancing the revolution and production within the mine.

In August and September of last year, when the broad revolutionary masses of Mine 702 were advancing courageously along Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the struggle between the two major factions of mass organizations in the local society was intense, directly affecting this mine. At that time, some people within the mine thought that since they had supported us in the past, we should also support them now. However, the majority of the masses believed that using Mao Zedong Thought to support the proletarian revolutionary factions is the most fundamental support. Everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the three shining examples in the "Old Three Articles" as a mirror to ignite a revolution in their souls, thoroughly exposing the crimes of factionalism, discussing the harm of factionalism, and deeply excavating the roots of factionalism. They finally made factionalism stink and dug out the "self" deeply. All the workers in the mine unanimously expressed that true proletarian revolutionaries must completely liberate themselves from the quagmire of factionalism, add bricks and tiles to consolidate revolutionary unity, and will not participate in factional struggles in society.

Currently, with the strong assistance of the Support Left Group, all the workers in the mine are holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, extensively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and launching a high tide of self-criticism and criticizing revisionism.

    广州部队驻七○二矿支左小组引导群众斗私批修
    从派性的泥坑中解放出来  从思想上巩固革命大联合
    据新华社广州三日电  人民解放军广州部队某部驻七○二矿支左小组，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，帮助这个矿实现革命大联合以后，又针对群众各个时期的活思想，不断引导他们活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使全矿革命大联合越来越巩固。现在这个矿的革命形势空前大好，生产搞得热气腾腾，提前三个多月完成了全年国家生产计划。
    去年三月，支左小组进驻七○二矿后，坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，经过一段耐心细致的思想政治工作，矿内七个革命群众组织于五月初实现了按部门、按车间、按班组的革命大联合。但是，由于一些群众组织没有及时克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，它们之间经常为一些非原则问题发生纠纷，严重地冲击着矿内的革命大联合。支左小组十分重视实现革命大联合以后的思想政治工作，不回避新矛盾、新问题，坚持以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓活思想，引导革命群众斗私批修，克服派性，增强党性。
    革命大联合刚实现不久，在讨论怎样开展矿内文化大革命时，两派就出现了分歧。从资产阶级反动路线的迫害下冲杀出来、人数最多的“九·四革命造反兵团”，由于地位发生了变化，少数人派性增长了，主张对那些曾经围攻过自己的群众进行报复。许多群众不赞成这样做。一时争论不休，矛盾不断激化。有些群众组织负责人暗地里拉人马，另立山头。矿内的革命大联合面临分裂的危险。支左小组指战员用毛泽东思想分析了当时的形势，认识到千怪万怪，是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，便组织全矿职工反复学习
  《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，引导两派革命群众在一起回忆旧社会的苦，控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行，特别是联系文化大革命以来矿内两条路线的斗争实践，帮助两派革命群众找出“三个大同”：一是爱相同，都热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；二是恨相同，都恨旧社会，恨帝、修、反，恨中国的赫鲁晓夫；三是走的路相同，都是坚决走社会主义道路。工人们激动地说：“千罪万罪，都是党内一小撮走资派的罪；一时上当的同志，都是阶级兄弟，尽管他们做过一些错事，但是这个账应该记在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。”“九·四革命造反兵团”负责人经过学习，深刻认识到，反动路线的根子是“私”字，如果“私”字不挖掉，我们也会上资产阶级反动路线的当。他便主动在群众大会上检查在对待其他群众组织上的错误言行，三番五次找曾经反对过自己的群众谈心，及时消除了隔阂。
    去年六月，随着矿内文化大革命运动的深入发展，在解决干部问题时又发生了新的分歧。矿内的革命大联合又一次面临破裂的危险。驻矿支左小组引导大家按照毛主席的干部政策去分析矿内的干部。毛主席教导我们：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”大家遵照毛主席教导，对干部进行了深入的调查研究和阶级分析。认识提高后，原来主张打倒一大批干部的群众，当众宣布收回自己的意见，表示要斗倒“私”字，打倒派性，坚决按照毛主席的干部政策办事。现在，这个矿已经有百分之九十五左右的干部和革命群众一道，斗私批修，抓革命、促生产，有力地推动了矿内的革命和生产滚滚向前。
    去年八、九月间，正当七○二矿的广大革命群众沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进的时候，当地社会上的两大派群众组织的斗争很激烈，直接影响到这个矿。当时矿内有些人认为，过去他们支持过我们，现在我们也应该支持他们。但是，大多数群众认为，用毛泽东思想去支援无产阶级革命派才是最根本的支援。大家以毛泽东思想为武器，以“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象为镜子，在灵魂深处爆发革命，大摆派性的罪状，大论派性的危害，大挖派性的根源，终于把派性搞得臭臭的，把“私”字挖得深深的。全矿职工一致表示，真正的无产阶级革命派必须从派性的泥坑中彻底解放出来，为巩固革命大联合添砖添瓦，决不参与社会上的派性斗争。
    现在，全矿职工在支左人员的大力帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用毛主席著作，掀起了斗私批修高潮。
