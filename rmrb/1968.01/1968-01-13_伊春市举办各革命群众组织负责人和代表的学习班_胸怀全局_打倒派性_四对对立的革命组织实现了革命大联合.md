Icun City's Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team organized a study class for leaders and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. The class, guided by the principle of "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism," helped participants overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and significantly promoted revolutionary unity.

The study class included leaders and representatives from four pairs of opposing revolutionary mass organizations in Nancha Forestry Bureau and Dailing Forestry Bureau. These organizations had been engaged in "internal wars" for a long time, arguing over minor issues and failing to unite. This hindered the revolutionary and productive efforts and affected the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in these units.

The study class repeatedly studied and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focusing on promoting revolutionary unity. By addressing three key aspects of fighting selfishness, the class achieved immediate results.

**Broad Perspective, Enhancing Self-Awareness in Fighting Selfishness**

Many participants initially came to the study class with issues from their "internal wars," arguing over minor points. To address this, the study class first organized discussions on the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the importance of achieving revolutionary unity as per Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The class emphasized that realizing revolutionary unity is a crucial step in carrying the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao's teachings deeply educated the participants, helping them see beyond minor issues and consider the bigger picture. They realized that factionalism within revolutionary mass organizations was a battle of selfishness, leading to increased factionalism and heavier selfishness. This distracted from the main enemy and harmed revolutionary comrades, interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They understood that failing to fight selfishness was disloyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and that without overcoming selfishness, the proletarian cause would be difficult to defend. Thus, the participants decided to direct their struggle against the revisionist clique headed by China's Khrushchev while also determinedly fighting selfishness within their own minds, uniting on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought.

**Fighting Selfishness Requires Offensive Battles, Daring to Confront**

Having the desire to overcome selfishness did not equate to having the courage to expose and fight it. Some participants hesitated to expose and fight selfishness in discussion and study sessions, fearing that their self-criticisms would be used against them. Therefore, they either remained silent or followed the lead of others, always on the defensive, unwilling to confront selfishness head-on. The study class believed that to promote self-overcoming and public-mindedness, participants must elevate their struggle to the level of two-line struggle. Only then could they, with deep hatred for selfishness, bravely attack the fortress of selfishness in their minds. The class organized participants to repeatedly study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's call to "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism," his teachings on criticism and self-criticism, and his latest instruction to "each make more self-criticism." This inspired and strengthened the participants' courage and determination to expose and fight selfishness. They said that true proletarian revolutionaries are not only pioneers in criticizing revisionism but also vanguards in fighting selfishness. The ability to spark a revolution within one's soul, to destroy the nest of selfishness, and to launch offensive and decisive battles against selfishness in one's mind is the dividing line between those who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end and those who are not.

A leader from Dailing's "New Dawn" previously believed that his faction had rebelled early and had great merit, thinking "only I am revolutionary" and unwilling to unite with another faction, "Red East." After the study, he actively sought out the leader of "Red East," several times self-criticizing his erroneous thoughts of "only I am revolutionary." The leader of "Red East" was deeply moved and also shared his fear that his organization would be swallowed up and his unwillingness to unite. The two leaders talked more and became closer, each introducing the other's high-minded self-criticisms to their respective factions, expressing their willingness to learn from each other, actively study Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on self-improvement. Their exemplary actions inspired both factions to actively seek each other's opinions. "Red East" comrades checked twelve shortcomings with "New Dawn" comrades; "New Dawn" comrades, in front of "Red East" comrades, tore up materials prepared for "internal war." Both sides quickly reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary unity.

**Consolidating Gains in Fighting Selfishness, Continuously Expanding Victories**

The transformation of one's worldview is a long and arduous process. It requires persistent struggle using Mao Zedong Thought against selfishness in one's mind, continuously consolidating gains and expanding victories in fighting selfishness. Only then can one resist impacts from the "left" or right and firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, remaining unshakable in the face of winds and waves.

After the opposing revolutionary mass organization leaders reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary unity through study, some below them still had doubts, saying it was a "surrender" to the other side, etc. These views caused new struggles in the minds of some leaders, shaking their resolve for revolutionary unity. The study class promptly discovered this trend and immediately organized participants to study Chairman Mao's teachings on insisting on truth and correcting errors, linking it to their thoughts. They realized that if their actions aligned with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and latest instructions, why should they waver? This was still the "selfishness" at work, fearing that their organization's comrades who temporarily did not understand would call them "surrenderers," fearing the loss of their "authority," etc. With this question in mind, they repeatedly studied the "Three Articles." They firmly said that uniting under revolutionary principles was a victory for public-mindedness, proletarian party spirit, and Mao Zedong Thought. They must overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and remain unshakable despite winds and waves. With new understandings, the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations actively did ideological work within their organizations, eliminating factionalism, fighting selfishness, and promoting the revolutionary unity of these four pairs of opposing revolutionary mass organizations.

    伊春市举办各革命群众组织负责人和代表的学习班
    胸怀全局　打倒派性
    四对对立的革命组织实现了革命大联合
    新华社哈尔滨十二日电　黑龙江省伊春市革命委员会和人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助参加学习的革命群众组织负责人和代表，狠斗“私”字，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，有力地促进了革命大联合。
    参加这个学习班的有南岔林业局、带岭林业局等单位的四对对立的革命群众组织的负责人和代表。过去，这些组织长时间打“内战”，在一些枝节问题上争论不休，一直联合不起来，影响了抓革命、促生产，影响了毛主席伟大战略部署在这些单位的贯彻执行。
    学习班反复学习、坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，以促进革命大联合为主要内容，抓住斗私的三个重要环节，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    胸怀大局，提高斗私的自觉性
    参加学习班的各革命群众组织的负责人和代表当中，有许多人原来是带着“内战”中的问题来找“裁判员”的。学习开始后，他们在枝节问题上争论不休。针对这一活思想，学习班首先组织学员大讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，大讲实现革命大联合是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的关键。学习班组织学员反复学习了毛主席的教导：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    毛主席的伟大教导，深刻地教育了学习班的学员们，使他们从枝节问题中跳了出来，胸中有了大局。他们说，革命群众组织之间无原则地打“内战”就是打“私”战，这个仗越打派性越大，越打私心越重。打“内战”，放过了主要敌人，伤害了革命战友，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是最不应该的。头脑里有私不斗，就是对伟大领袖毛主席不忠。“私”字不斗倒，无产阶级的江山就难保。于是，学员们纷纷把斗争的锋芒对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派；同时也决心狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，在毛泽东思想原则基础上实现革命大联合。
  斗私要打进攻战，敢于刺刀见红
    学员们有了破私的愿望，并不等于有了亮私、斗私的勇气。一些学员在谈心会、学习会上亮私、斗私还有顾虑。他们怕自己主动检查会被对方抓住小辫子，成为对方攻击自己的“炮弹”。因此，他们或者闷声不响，或者看对方刮啥风，就使啥舵，处处自卫，打防御战，不敢刺刀见红。这时，学习班认为，必须帮助学员把破私立公提到两条路线斗争的高度，才能促使他们怀着对“私”字的深仇大恨，勇于向头脑中的“私”字堡垒进攻。学习班组织学员反复学习、深刻领会毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，学习毛主席关于批评和自我批评的伟大教导和“各自多做自我批评”的最新指示，从而激发和坚定了学员们亮私、斗私的勇气和决心。他们说，真正的无产阶级革命派不但是批修的闯将，而且是斗私的尖兵。能不能在自己灵魂深处爆发革命，自捣“私”字老窝，向自己头脑中的“私”字打进攻战、攻坚战，是区别是不是决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派的分水岭。带岭“新曙光”负责人过去总以为自己一派造反早，功劳大，“唯我独革”，不愿同另一派“东方红”联合。学习后，他主动找“东方红”的负责人，几次对自己“唯我独革”的错误思想进行了自我批评。“东方红”的负责人非常感动，也谈出怕自己的组织被吃掉不愿联合的想法。两个头头越谈越亲热，越谈越知心。他们又各自向自己一派的群众介绍了对方高姿态的检查情况，互相表示向对方学习，活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，主动搞好团结，联合对敌战斗。他们的模范行动带动了两派群众，主动征求对方的意见。“东方红”的同志向“新曙光”的同志检查了十二条缺点；“新曙光”的同志也当着“东方红”同志的面撕毁了准备打“内战”的材料，双方迅速达成了实现革命大联合的协议。
    巩固斗私成绩，不断扩大战果
    世界观的改造是长期的、艰巨的，必须坚持用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，不断巩固斗私的成绩，不断扩大斗私的战果，才能抵制住来自“左”的或右的方面的冲击，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，风吹浪打不动摇。
    原来对立的革命群众组织负责人，通过学习达成实现革命大联合的协议以后，下面有些人思想仍然不通，说这是向对方“投降”等等。这些说法在一些负责人的头脑中引起新的斗争，对革命大联合产生动摇。学习班及时发现了这种苗头，立即组织学员们学习毛主席关于坚持真理，修正错误的教导，并且联系思想实际，使他们认识到，既然自己做的符合毛主席的伟大战略部署，符合毛主席的最新指示，为什么还发生动摇？这还是个“私”字在作怪，怕自己组织内一时思想不通的群众骂自己“投降”，怕失掉自己的“威信”等。他们带着这个问题，又反复学习了“老三篇”。他们坚定地说，我们在革命原则下联合起来，这是“公”字的胜利，是无产阶级党性的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们就是要打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，任凭风吹浪打，一丝一毫不动摇。各革命群众组织的负责人带着新的认识，又主动去做本组织内其他同志的思想工作，铲除派性，狠斗“私”字，促使这四对对立的革命群众组织都实现了革命的大联合。
