In the stormy struggle against British imperialism, the workers of Hong Kong have extensively applied Mao Zedong Thought. Guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the British fascist authorities.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 12: In the struggle of Hong Kong patriots against British imperialism, workers from various industries in Hong Kong have further launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has increasingly penetrated the hearts of the masses, illuminating the direction of the workers' struggle, promoting their ideological revolution, and this is a significant achievement of the eight-month-long struggle against British imperialism.

The mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought among workers from various industries in Hong Kong has developed in the stormy struggle against British imperialism. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggle, bravely counterattacking the British fascist authorities' rampant assaults, firmly defending the great Mao Zedong Thought, and safeguarding the sacred right of Hong Kong patriots to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Heroic rubber and plastic workers, in the struggle, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displaying the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither the enemy's bloody suppression nor the first to take up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," posted the first big-character poster against British imperialism on the streets of Hong Kong. Subsequently, in the "June 23" struggle to defend the union hall, they fought for seven hours, resisting hundreds of fully armed Hong Kong British "riot police" and special agents, greatly boosting the morale of patriots and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of British imperialism. Workers at the Kowloon Shipyard, in the face of the enemy's mad attack on the union hall, with the union secretary He Feng sacrificing his life and most of the leaders being illegally arrested, they studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, firmly relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and implementing a full-scale workers' linkage throughout the factory. As a result, within a few days, they organized the masses and continued the struggle. Workers of the Tsuen Wan branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile and Dyeing Workers' Union, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly repelled the British military police and special agents' eight mad attacks, foiling the enemy's plot to dismantle the union, making the union increasingly develop and grow stronger.

Since last October, a mass movement to extensively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle has unprecedentedly developed among workers from various industries. In various unions, factories, and workers' homes, scenes of fathers teaching sons, sons teaching mothers, colleagues, and spouses teaching and learning from each other are everywhere. From striking workers to employed workers, from workers' families with children in their teens to elderly people with white hair, all with deep national hatred and class resentment, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly study the works of Chairman Mao, and strive to learn a little and apply it a little, quickly putting it into action. Many old workers and workers' family members overcame various difficulties, showing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. A 78-year-old old woman worker, in order to master Mao Zedong Thought, diligently studied culture. The first book she read was the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," studying the quotation "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism"; the first time she learned to write was to write "Long live Chairman Mao." A seaman's family member, due to having many children and economic difficulties, had to do heavy housework every day and do home handicrafts to supplement the family income. However, she still overcame difficulties and insisted on studying, copying the quotations from Chairman Mao she needed to study on a piece of paper every day, sticking it on the wall opposite the sewing machine, studying while working. When encountering words she didn't recognize, she would wait until night to ask her children.

Many unions have become places for workers to study Mao Zedong Thought. Since late October last year, various unions have generally organized study groups or classes on the works of Chairman Mao, through various forms such as lectures, discussions, experience-sharing meetings, singing quotations songs, and cultural performances, vigorously carrying out the study and propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Electric Power Company's staff union, based on the dispersed residence of workers, organized 170 study groups in a localized manner, organizing 99% of the striking workers to study. The Hong Kong Seamen's Union, based on the needs of seamen, established the first batch of Mao Zedong Thought study classes after the National Day last year. The number of participants in the study of the Kowloon branch of the Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union exceeded the total of the past 18 years, and some workers who never went to the union and originally had reservations now also participate in the study. Since late June last year, workers at Kowloon Dock have established an unbreakable study system, insisting on studying every day and using it every day. During the days when the British authorities carried out large-scale arrests and suppression of Hong Kong patriots, workers at Kowloon Dock still insisted on returning to the union to study.

Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers in Hong Kong has been unprecedentedly heightened, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

Xue Tianbo's wife, Zeng Xiuyun, used to pay no attention to national affairs. After her husband was brutally beaten to death by the British fascist police, Zeng Xiuyun recognized the true face of British fascism and actively participated in the struggle against British imperialism. However, she was still worried about her only son, fearing that he would be arrested by the British authorities if he participated in the struggle, keeping her son locked at home all day. Later, she joined the union's study group and seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs, for the people's interests, have heroically sacrificed their lives in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward, treading in their blood!" She thought of her husband and many martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the people's interests and their deaths were heavier than Mount Tai, her son should inherit his father's will and participate in the struggle, and such action was completely correct. After thinking of these, she not only no longer obstructed her son's just actions but also encouraged other martyrs' families to participate in the struggle, tirelessly contributing her strength to the struggle against British imperialism.

Many workers, through study, realized that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, "organizing tens of thousands of people, mobilizing a surging revolutionary army," can this struggle against British imperialism be won. Workers consciously carried out in-depth and detailed work to mobilize the masses, enthusiastically propagandizing Mao Zedong Thought, thereby rapidly expanding the anti-British and anti-violence forces.

    在反英抗暴斗争的暴风雨中
    香港工人大学大用毛泽东思想
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导斗争，一次又一次地沉重打击了港英法西斯当局
    据新华社香港十二日电　在香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中，香港各业工人最近进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。战无不胜的毛泽东思想越来越深入人心，照亮了广大工人斗争的方向，促进了他们思想的革命化，这是八个月来反英抗暴斗争的重大成果。
    香港各业工人活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，是在反英抗暴斗争的暴风雨中发展起来的。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指导斗争，一次又一次英勇地回击了港英法西斯当局的猖狂进攻，坚决捍卫了伟大的毛泽东思想，维护了香港爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利。英雄的树胶塑胶工人在斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢字当头的精神，不怕敌人血腥镇压，首先拿起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在香港街头贴出了第一张反英抗暴大字报，接着又在“六·二三”保卫工会会所的斗争中，奋战了七个小时，抗击了数百名全副武装的港英“防暴队”和特务，大长了爱国同胞的志气，大灭了港英帝国主义的威风。九龙船坞工人在工会会所遭到敌人疯狂袭击，工会书记何枫英勇牺牲，大部分领导人被非法逮捕的艰难情况下，他们活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决依靠群众，放手发动群众，实行全厂工人大串连，结果在几天之内，就把群众组织起来，继续进行斗争。港九纺织染职工总会荃湾支会的工人，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，连续打退了港英军警特务的八次疯狂袭击，粉碎了敌人要搞垮这个工会的阴谋，使工会越来越发展壮大。
    从去年十月份开始，一个在斗争中大学大用毛泽东思想的群众运动，在各业工人中空前发展起来。在各个工会、工厂和工人家庭里，到处出现父教子，子教母，工友之间、夫妻之间互教互学的动人情景。从罢工工人到在业工人，工人家属中从十几岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，都怀着深重的民族仇、阶级恨，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，并且努力学一点用一点，迅速落实在行动上。许多老工人和工人家属克服了各种困难，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱的感情。一位七十八岁的老女工为了把毛泽东思想学到手，刻苦地学习文化，她第一次读书就捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，学习“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”这条语录；第一次学会写字，就是写“毛主席万岁”。一位海员家属由于子女多，经济困难，每天除了要做繁重的家务外，还要做家庭手工弥补家计。但是她仍然克服困难，坚持学习，每天把要学习的毛主席语录抄在一张纸上，贴在缝纫机对面的墙上，一边工作，一边学习。碰到有不认识的字就等到晚上请教孩子。
    许多工会成了工人学习毛泽东思想的场所。从去年十月下旬开始，各工会普遍组织学习毛主席著作小组或举办学习班，通过报告会、座谈会、讲用会、唱语录歌和文艺汇演等多种多样形式，大力开展学习和宣传毛泽东思想的活动。中华电力公司华员职工会根据工人居住分散的特点，因地制宜地组织起一百七十个学习组，把百分之九十九的罢工工人都组织起来学习。香港海员工会根据海员的要求，在去年国庆节后，创办了第一批毛泽东思想学习班。摩托车业职工总会九龙分会参加学习的人数，超过了过去十八年来的总和，一些从来不到工会和原来有顾虑的工人，现在也参加了学习。九龙仓工人从去年六月下旬开始，便建立了雷打不散的学习制度，坚持天天学，天天用。在港英当局对香港爱国同胞实行大搜捕、大镇压的日子里，九龙仓工人仍然坚持回工会学习。
    通过活学活用毛主席著作，香港广大工人的阶级觉悟空前提高，精神面貌发生了巨大变化。
    徐田波烈士的妻子曾秀云，过去不注意国家大事。自从她丈夫被万恶的港英法西斯警察活活打死以后，曾秀云认识到港英法西斯的真面目，积极投入了反英抗暴斗争。但是，她对她的独生儿子还很不放心，害怕他参加斗争会被港英当局抓去，整天把儿子关在家里。后来，她参加了工会的学习小组，认真地学习了毛主席的教导：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”她想到自己的丈夫和许多烈士为着人民的利益而光荣牺牲，他们的死是比泰山还要重的，儿子要继承他父亲的遗志参加斗争，这种行动是完全正确的。想到这些以后，她不但不再阻止儿子的正义行动，而且还带动其他烈属参加斗争，不辞劳苦地为反英抗暴贡献自己的力量。
    许多工人通过学习，认识到只有遵照毛主席的教导，“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，才能取得这场反英抗暴斗争的胜利。工人们自觉地进行深入细致的发动群众的工作，热情宣传毛泽东思想，从而迅速壮大了反英抗暴队伍。
