	The Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement calls for a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works
	To establish a Communist Party guided by Mao Zedong Thought
	The Mexican revolutionary movement can only develop by relying on Mao Zedong Thought

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, a message from Mexico City: The provisional national leadership of the Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement recently issued a resolution stating: "Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism. To deviate from Mao Zedong Thought is to deviate from Marxism, to deviate from the revolution. This is the starting point for us to carry out any resolute revolutionary actions, and this is also the touchstone to test whether one is a genuine proletarian revolutionary."

	The resolution pointed out that Marxism has gone through three major stages: the stage when Marx and Engels established the theory of scientific socialism; the stage when Lenin developed Marxism in the era of imperialism, raising Marxism to the level of Leninism. The current stage is that of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Comrade Mao Zedong "creatively and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought."

	The resolution pointed out that Marxism has been the most hated by the bourgeoisie since its birth. Especially when Marxism develops to a new stage, it faces even more ferocious opposition from the bourgeoisie and revisionists. Various reactionary ideological currents disguised as Marxism have emerged, attempting to obstruct the new surge of the revolution. In the era when Leninism emerged, the Second International revisionists and the bourgeoisie rose up to oppose Leninism in ideology, politics, and practice. At that time, many bourgeois sects with the label of Marxism appeared, but all these sects were bankrupt in the face of Leninism.

	The resolution quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "Revisionism, or right opportunism, is a bourgeois ideology. It is more dangerous than dogmatism. Revisionists, right opportunists, also hang the label of Marxism on their mouths. They also attack 'dogmatism.' But what they attack is the most fundamental thing in Marxism."

	The resolution further pointed out that currently, in the communist movement, there is a trend that verbally supports Marxism but fiercely opposes Marxism in practice. The main bourgeois reactionary ideology is Khrushchev revisionism.

	The resolution emphasized that it is necessary to establish a Communist Party guided by contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. It is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought to oppose all reactionary ideologies, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, to closely connect with the revolutionary masses, mainly the poor peasants, and to constantly study the conditions and situation of the peasant struggle. The resolution said: "This is the only correct way to become a genuine proletarian revolutionary and to establish a genuine Marxist-Leninist organization." This organization should "lead the people to the path of people's war until national liberation and socialism are achieved."

	The resolution emphasized: "The theory that guides our actions and thoughts is Marxism-Leninism. All our revolutionary actions start from the recognition that Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

	The resolution called on all members of the Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement to take this as a criterion, to launch a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to draw a clear line in politics, ideology, and style with all bourgeois reactionary ideologies, and to put political and ideological construction in the first place.

	The resolution of the provisional national leadership of the Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement finally pointed out that as long as it relies on Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary movement in Mexico will definitely develop.

    墨西哥马列主义运动号召开展学习和运用毛主席著作运动
    以毛泽东思想为指导建立共产党
    墨西哥革命运动只有依靠毛泽东思想才能得到发展
    据新华社讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动临时全国领导机构最近在一项决议中指出：“毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，背离毛泽东思想就是背离马克思主义，就是背离革命。这是我们能够开展任何坚决的革命行动的出发点，这也是鉴别是否是真正的无产阶级革命者的试金石。”
    这项决议指出，马克思主义经历了三个主要的阶段：即马克思和恩格斯创立科学社会主义理论的阶段；列宁在帝国主义时代发展了马克思主义，把马克思主义提到列宁主义阶段。当前是毛泽东思想的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志“创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个新阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。”
    决议指出，马克思主义从其诞生起就一直遭到资产阶级的最大仇视。特别是当马克思主义发展到一个新阶段的时候，更遭到资产阶级和修正主义分子的疯狂反对。各种打扮成马克思主义的资产阶级反动思潮激增，妄图阻止革命的新高涨。在列宁主义出现的时代，第二国际修正主义分子和资产阶级在思想上、政治上和实践上起来反对列宁主义，当时出现了许多挂着马克思主义招牌的资产阶级流派，但是所有这些流派在列宁主义面前都遭到了破产。
    决议援引毛主席的一段语录说：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”
    决议接着指出，目前，在共产主义运动中存在着一股“口头上赞成马克思主义而实际上疯狂反对马克思主义的思潮，其中主要的资产阶级反动思潮，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义。”
    决议强调指出，必须用当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想为指导来建立共产党。要用毛泽东思想来反对一切反动思潮，开展批评和自我批评，紧密联系革命群众，主要是贫农，经常研究农民群众斗争的条件和形势。决议说：“这是成为真正的无产阶级革命者和建立一个真正的马列主义组织的唯一正确的道路”，这个组织应“领导人民走人民战争的道路，直到取得民族解放和社会主义”。
    决议强调说：“指导我们行动和我们思想的理论是马克思列宁主义。我们的一切革命行动都从承认毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义这一基础出发。”
    决议号召墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动的全体成员以此为准则，开展一个学习和运用毛主席著作的运动，在政治上、思想上和作风上同一切资产阶级反动思潮划清界限，把政治上和思想上的建设放在首位。
    墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动临时全国领导机构的决议最后指出，只要依靠毛泽东思想，墨西哥的革命运动一定能够得到发展。
