The study class of Mao Zedong Thought at the Korean Middle School in Tonghua, Jilin Province, has learned from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing class education. Starting from class education, they have struggled against selfishness and eliminated factionalism, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and have strengthened the revolutionary great alliance in thought.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the two revolutionary mass organizations at the Korean Middle School in Tonghua recently achieved a revolutionary great alliance and established the Revolutionary Committee of the Proletarian Great Alliance for the entire school. The two factions actively tore down the walls they had built in the corridors during the "internal war." However, because the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism had not been thoroughly overcome, the ideological barriers had not been completely eliminated, and the invisible "walls" still existed. Therefore, they set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

At the beginning of the study class, the first problem they encountered was that studying was not connected with their own ideological transformation. One faction said, "Our organization rebelled the earliest and is the most revolutionary. Participating in the study class is to help others struggle against selfishness." The other faction said, "We understand the policies the best. They made serious mistakes. Struggling against selfishness is their business."

The Revolutionary Committee of the Proletarian Great Alliance used the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing class education, starting from class education, and invited comrades who had suffered greatly before liberation to tell their family histories of hardship in the study class, conducting a class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. Many comrades recounted their parents' bitter experiences in the old society, tearfully. One bitter event after another, one hardship after another, increased the comrades' hatred for China's Khrushchev and their hatred for the "selfish" attitude.

Through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, the comrades' deep class feelings for studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions were greatly aroused. Chairman Mao said, "The two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." The comrades all used Chairman Mao's teachings to examine themselves, exposing their own "selfish" manifestations, and their actions that did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. They mutually inspired and helped each other. In this way, those who previously thought there was no selfishness to struggle against also felt that there was selfishness to struggle against. However, seeing selfishness did not mean that selfishness had been eliminated. Some people, although they admitted having selfishness, lacked the courage to openly bring it out to struggle against, fearing that exposing their dirty thoughts would make them lose face, advocating quietly changing it; some feared that exposing their organization's shortcomings would negate their correct direction; and some wanted to see the other side's attitude, exposing as much as the other side did, in an equal exchange. At this time, the Revolutionary Committee organized everyone in the study class to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. The students of Class 2, Grade 1 of the senior high school stood in front of the martyrs' tower, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, reading over and over again, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" The more they read, the more they felt they were letting Chairman Mao down. Everyone deeply felt: daring or not daring to struggle against selfishness is the question of whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's instructions, whether or not to use Mao Zedong Thought to reform oneself. This is the touchstone for determining whether one is a thoroughly revolutionary faction or a revolutionary faction in name only. The comrades all expressed that they would, like the revolutionary martyrs on the battlefield hating the class enemies, hate the "selfish" attitude in their minds, become pioneers in criticizing revisionism, and become vanguards in struggling against selfishness, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After the self-awareness of struggling against selfishness was raised, they no longer hesitated, worried, or observed passively, but instead eagerly exposed their selfishness and ugliness, struggling and criticizing fiercely.

    斗私心铲派性从思想上巩固革命大联合
    通化朝鲜族中学学习班从阶级教育入手全面落实毛主席最新指示
    据新华社长春十二日电　吉林省通化市朝鲜族中学毛泽东思想学习班，学习解放军狠抓阶级教育的经验，从阶级教育入手，斗私心，铲派性，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，从思想上巩固了革命的大联合。
    通化市朝鲜族中学两大革命群众组织，在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，在解放军的协助下，最近，实现了革命的大联合，成立了全校无产阶级革命大联合委员会。两派主动把打“内战”时在走廊上筑起的墙拆除了。但是，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性没有彻底打倒，思想上的隔阂并没完全消除，无形的“墙”依然存在。于是，他们在全校普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修。
    学习班开始时，遇到的第一个问题，就是学习与自己思想改造挂不上钩。一派说：“我们组织造反最早，最革命，参加学习班是帮助别人斗私。”另一派说：
  “我们掌握政策最好，他们犯了严重错误，斗私是他们的事。”学校无产阶级革命大联合委员会，运用解放军狠抓阶级教育的经验，从阶级教育入手，在学习班中请解放前苦大仇深的同学讲述苦难家史，进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。很多同学一字一泪讲述父辈们在旧社会的苦难遭遇。一桩桩的血泪仇，一件件的苦难史，增强了同学们对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，增强了对“私”字的仇恨。
    通过忆苦思甜，大大激发了同学们对学习毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示的深厚阶级感情。毛主席说：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”同学们都用毛主席的教导来对照，摆自己“私”字的表现，摆自己有那些不符合毛主席教导的言行，互相启发，互相帮助。这样，过去认为无私可斗的同学，也感到有私可斗了。但是，看到了私心，并不等于挖掉了私心。有的人虽然承认有私心，但缺乏勇气，不敢公开拿出来斗，怕把脏思想亮出来丢人，主张悄悄改了就行；有的怕把自己组织的缺点一抖出来否定了自己的大方向；也有的人要看对方的态度，对方亮多少自己就亮多少，等价交换。这时，大联委就在学习班里组织大家活学活用毛主席著作。高中一年二班的同学站在烈士塔前，双手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地朗读着：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”他们越读越感到对不起毛主席。大家深深感到：敢不敢斗私，是执行不执行毛主席的指示，用不用毛泽东思想革自己的命的问题，这是衡量是完全革命派还是口头革命派的试金石。同学们纷纷表示，要象革命先烈们在战场上仇恨阶级敌人那样，恨自己头脑里的“私”字，做批修的闯将，做斗私的尖兵，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    斗私的自觉性提高以后，他们不再顾虑这，担心那，犹豫观望了，而是争先恐后地亮私摆丑，狠斗狠批。
