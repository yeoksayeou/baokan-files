On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the "January Revolution" storm that shook the world, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, who have made great achievements in the Shanghai region's Cultural Revolution, have reviewed and summarized their "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work over the past year. They have drawn a fundamental conclusion: To fully implement Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives is the fundamental task of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. By ensuring that Mao Zedong's latest directives are fully implemented, the Cultural Revolution can advance along the great course charted by Chairman Mao and achieve victory.

In the past year, when the Cultural Revolution achieved decisive victories, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai made significant contributions in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have, with the greatest determination and the fastest speed, studied, executed, and propagated Mao Zedong's latest directives and the strategic deployments of the proletarian headquarters represented by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's latest directives have been fully implemented, and Mao Zedong's brilliant thoughts and specific policies have been directly grasped by the broad masses of the people. This has ensured that the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai has advanced step by step and achieved victory after victory, creating an unprecedentedly good situation.

The main experiences gained by the PLA units stationed in Shanghai in implementing Mao Zedong Thought and fully implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work are as follows:

1. Arm the broad revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and fully implement Mao Zedong's latest directives. This is the fundamental task of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the past year's practice of the Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have deeply felt that by propagating, organizing, and arming the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, guiding them to act in strict accordance with Mao Zedong's directives, victory is ensured. Therefore, in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, they have, with deep class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Mao Zedong, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought and conscientiously implemented Mao Zedong's latest directives. They have been good soldiers in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives. Once Mao Zedong's latest directives are fully implemented, the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work is done well. When some comrades from a certain regiment of the Shanghai Garrison began their left-supporting tasks, they tried to handle everything, big or small, and some, in an attempt to show their "clear stance," hastily made statements without emphasizing the fundamental task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives. The regiment's party committee, in response to this active thinking, organized a discussion on the topic of "Grasping the fundamentals or handling trivial matters?" and "How to show a clear stance?" during the training of the left-supporting personnel. Many comrades shared their personal experiences on the importance of grasping the fundamentals. The six revolutionary mass organizations in the Shanghai Lianhuan Chemical Factory had once engaged in intense "internal warfare," affecting the entire factory's revolution and production. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the factory, they did not support one faction while suppressing another but instead focused on propagating Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives. This quickly resolved the differences among the mass organizations, uniting them on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and transforming the revolutionary and production landscape.

These good experiences have deepened the comrades' understanding: In any complex situation, one must firmly believe in three things: firmly believe that Mao Zedong's words have the greatest power; firmly believe that the broad revolutionary masses listen to Mao Zedong's words the most; and firmly believe that acting in accordance with Mao Zedong's latest directives will gain the greatest trust and support from the broad masses. Under this guidance, many propaganda teams have firmly, consciously, and thoroughly followed Mao Zedong's latest directives. Wherever there are masses and difficulties, they go there to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and implement Mao Zedong's latest directives, focusing on arming and educating the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives, ensuring that Mao Zedong's latest directives take deep root in the hearts of the masses.

2. Through repeated struggles, eliminate interference, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle to ensure that Mao Zedong's latest directives are fully implemented.

As the Cultural Revolution deepens, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are unwilling to accept their doom and frequently change their counter-revolutionary strategies, playing tricks and using anarchist and non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary ranks to resist the implementation of Mao Zedong's latest directives, attempting to disrupt Mao Zedong's great strategic deployments. The soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, while timely exposing and smashing the enemy's plots and sabotage activities, have also fought against anarchist tendencies and non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary ranks. They have conducted in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work among the revolutionary masses, patiently guiding them to eliminate interference and impacts from the right or ultra-left, ensuring that Mao Zedong's latest directives are fully implemented. After the establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, two revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai had sharp conflicts due to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Facing this situation, the left-supporting personnel from the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, on one hand, vigorously propagated Mao Zedong's latest directives on revolutionary great unity among the broad masses, and on the other hand, conducted extensive, in-depth, and meticulous ideological and political work. They studied Mao Zedong's latest directives with the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations and even visited the homes of the organization leaders for individual talks, helping both sides to lay their problems on the table and exchange views frankly, avoiding "internal warfare" and consolidating revolutionary great unity.

The soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have also made great efforts to help the revolutionary masses of the proletarian revolutionaries to study and apply Mao Zedong's works, using Mao Zedong's latest directives as weapons to analyze and understand the situation, and in any complex situation, maintaining a clear mind and firmly grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle. The five revolutionary mass organizations in the Third Cargo Handling Area of the Shanghai Port Bureau had once engaged in intense "internal warfare." The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed there, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletarian revolutionaries, repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's relevant latest directives, using Mao Zedong's latest directives as powerful ideological weapons to analyze the situation in the entire area and the demands of the broad masses, making everyone realize: Focusing on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party without fighting them, and only engaging in "internal warfare," is the wrong direction. Not acting in accordance with Mao Zedong's latest directives is the greatest disloyalty to Mao Zedong. Thus, the various revolutionary mass organizations sat down for thorough consultations, establishing the Revolutionary Great Criticism Joint Committee, mobilizing the broad masses to launch a resounding revolutionary great criticism, and achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the great criticism.

The soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai said, helping the broad revolutionary masses to directly grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives, and learning to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze everything and command everything, this leaves behind an ever-present Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which is the strongest support for the leftist broad masses.

3. Vigorous establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and the establishment of the revolutionary learning style advocated by Mao Zedong, is the fundamental measure to fully implement Mao Zedong's latest directives.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the best classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives, and the best battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Since last September, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, according to the urgent requests of the broad proletarian revolutionaries, have adjusted their organizational forces and concentrated their efforts to assist the proletarian revolutionaries in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes system by system. So far, tens of thousands of people from various systems such as industry, transportation, agriculture, commerce, and education in Shanghai have participated in the study classes and achieved remarkable results. The Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry System, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the implementation of Mao Zedong's latest directives, not only achieved the first revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the city by system and department but also promoted a large number of revolutionary cadres to come forward, with more than 60% of the units in the entire system having established revolutionary committees. More than 500 leaders at the section chief level and above in the Shanghai Commercial Bureau No. 1 participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with most of them coming forward. Of the 29 units under the bureau, 24 have established temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have deeply felt that helping the revolutionary masses to establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Mao Zedong is the fundamental key to establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They first focus on the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, making the students in the study classes realize: Studying Mao Zedong's latest directives, whether to follow them or not, whether to implement them or not, is a matter of class feelings and fundamental attitude towards Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. In this way, the comrades participating in the study classes voluntarily and strictly require themselves to act in strict accordance with Mao Zedong's latest directives. In a recent Mao Zedong Thought study class in the Yangpu District of Shanghai, with the help of the PLA comrades, the focus was on promoting Mao Zedong's advocated revolutionary learning style and fully implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives as the top priority. The comrades participating in the study class, following Mao Zedong's teachings, voluntarily engaged in revolution, voluntarily criticized and repudiated revisionism, and voluntarily exposed their own "braids" and "sores," greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of all the students. After the study class ended, 11 schools that sent people to participate in this study class all established revolutionary committees, strongly promoting the resumption of classes and making revolution.

The "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work personnel of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai also noticed that as the Cultural Revolution deepens, whether the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in power can firmly implement Mao Zedong's latest directives is a crucial issue for the victory of the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the PLA comrades pay special attention to organizing the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations to participate in the study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives to arm their minds, promoting them to act in accordance with Mao Zedong's latest directives once they have studied them. The result of firmly grasping the leaders' study is that many leaders, after returning to their units from the study classes, vigorously implemented Mao Zedong's latest directives, firmly grasped ideological and political work, further promoted the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary masses in their units, and promoted the Cultural Revolution in their units.

4. The three military branches working together in unity and coordination is an important guarantee for fully implementing Mao Zedong's latest directives.

In the sharp and complex class struggle, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have always closely followed Mao Zedong's great strategic deployments, respecting, coordinating, supporting, and assisting each other in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, and acting in unity under the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. They have ensured unified work deployment, unified policies and principles, and unified specific work steps. In areas and systems (bureaus) where there are more than two military branches supporting the left, they have also consulted and decided on unified command by one military branch, ensuring unified organizational leadership. In daily "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, the three military branches have established a system of regular contact, mutual communication, and close consultation, timely communicating information and thoughts. In units where both sides participate in the work, when errors occur in the work, they strictly discipline themselves and take responsibility. When bad elements in society incite some uninformed masses to direct their attacks at the PLA, attempting to sow discord between the military branches, they handle the situation with special care, conducting thorough investigations and research, unifying their understanding with other military branches, and jointly solving problems, smashing the enemy's plots and tricks. The soldiers and officers of the three military branches said: The high unity of the three military branches on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought ensures that Mao Zedong's latest directives can be swiftly and fully implemented in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work.

5. To truly implement Mao Zedong's latest directives, one must arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and work hard on transforming one's worldview.

The great leader Mao Zedong said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the great combat mission of "Three Supports, Two Militaries," is a great classroom for the broad masses of soldiers and officers to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and to transform their worldview. To promote thought revolutionization, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work have universally established systems such as "Daily Reading," "Party and League Life," "Interval Training," and "Regular Training," regularly checking thoughts and criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have also voluntarily used the "five standards" to examine themselves, which are:

(1) An unshakable political stance of unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong;
(2) A passionate political enthusiasm for vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives;
(3) A firm revolutionary will to bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives;
(4) A strict spirit of self-criticism, constantly comparing oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's latest directives;
(5) An attitude of humbly learning from the proletarian revolutionaries.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work have, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, weathered storms, seen the world, humbly learned from the proletarian revolutionaries, and been greatly tempered and transformed, emerging as a large number of advanced collectives and individuals. In one unit participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, more than 60% of the personnel were evaluated as active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong's works in the annual four-good evaluation.

The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Shanghai is unprecedentedly good and getting better, greatly inspiring the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai. The revolutionary spirit of the broad proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai has greatly educated the broad masses of soldiers and officers. Through summarizing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai are more spirited and full of fighting spirit, determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the new year, to better learn from, execute, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong's latest directives, and to raise the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work to a new level.

    驻沪陆海空三军总结“三支”“两军”工作经验
    毛主席的最新指示全面落实了“三支”“两军”工作也就做好了
    新华社上海十一日电　在震撼世界的“一月革命”风暴一周年前夕，在上海地区无产阶级文化大革命中建立了丰功伟绩的人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军指战员，满怀革命豪情，回顾和总结了一年来的“三支”“两军”工作，得出了一条最根本的经验，这就是：必须把普及、传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示，作为“三支”“两军”工作的根本任务，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，保证无产阶级文化大革命沿着伟大统帅毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的过去一年中，驻沪三军指战员在“三支”“两军”中作出了巨大贡献。广大指战员在上海市革命委员会的领导下，对毛主席的每一项最新指示，对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署，都以最大的决心，最快的速度，认真学习，忠实执行，热情宣传，勇敢捍卫。毛主席的最新指示条条落实，毛主席的光辉思想和各项具体政策为广大人民群众所直接掌握，使上海地区无产阶级文化大革命步步深入，节节胜利，出现了空前的大好局面。
    驻沪三军在“三支”“两军”工作中，普及伟大的毛泽东思想，做好条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的工作所取得的主要经验是：
    一、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是“三支”“两军”工作的根本任务。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。驻沪三军指战员在过去一年文化大革命的实践中深深体会到，用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，引导广大革命群众不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事，就是胜利。因此，他们在“三支”“两军”工作中，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚的阶级感情，积极地宣传毛泽东思想，扎扎实实地做落实毛主席最新指示的工作，老老实实地做宣传毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示的好战士。毛主席的最新指示全面落实了，“三支”“两军”的工作也就做好了。上海警备区某师部分同志开始执行支左任务时，有的事无巨细，什么都抓，有的为了表示自己“旗帜鲜明”，匆忙表态，不注意突出宣传毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示这项根本任务。师党委针对这种活思想，在支左人员整训时，就组织大家带着这个问题活学活用毛主席著作，开展“抓根本还是抓事务？”“怎么样才算旗帜鲜明？”的专题大讨论。很多同志用自己亲身的体会谈了抓根本的重要意义。上海燎原化工厂的六个革命群众组织，曾经一度大打“内战”，使全厂革命和生产受到影响。毛泽东思想宣传队进厂后，没有支持一派压制另一派，而是全力宣传毛泽东思想，全力贯彻毛主席的最新指示，使几个群众组织很快消除了分歧，在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来，革命、生产面貌焕然一新。
    这些好经验，加深了同志们的认识：在任何复杂的情况下，都必须坚持三个“坚信”：坚信毛主席的话威力最大；坚信广大革命群众最听毛主席的话；坚信按照毛主席的最新指示办事，一定能得到广大群众的最大信任和支持。在这个思想指导下，许多宣传队对毛主席的最新指示，做到了坚决地跟，自觉地跟，跟到底，跟出结果来。哪里有群众，哪里有困难，就到哪里宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席的最新指示，千头万绪不转向，一心一意用毛泽东思想，用毛主席最新指示武装群众，教育群众，让毛主席最新指示在群众心坎里深深扎根。
    二、反复斗争，排除干扰，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，保证毛主席最新指示条条落实、全面落实。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，党内一小撮走资派总是不甘心他们的灭亡，不时变化反革命策略，极力玩弄阴谋，利用革命队伍中的无政府主义和各种非无产阶级思想，极力抵制毛主席最新指示的落实，妄图打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署。驻沪三军指战员，在及时揭穿和粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动的同时，还与革命群众队伍中的无政府主义思潮和各种非无产阶级思想进行了斗争。他们在革命群众中做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，循循善诱，及时排除来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰和冲击，保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。在上海市革命委员会成立以后，上海有两个革命群众组织，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，一度产生了尖锐的矛盾。面临这个局面，驻沪三军支左人员一面在广大群众中大力宣传毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，一面进行了大量的深入细致的思想政治工作，与两个革命群众组织的负责人一起学习毛主席的最新指示，部队负责人还深入到革命群众组织负责人家里访问，个别谈心，帮助双方把问题摆到桌面上来，坦率地交换意见，避免了打“内战”，巩固了革命大联合。
    驻沪三军指战员还以极大的努力，帮助无产阶级革命派战士活学活用毛主席著作，学会以毛主席最新指示为武器，分析形势，认识形势，在任何复杂情况下，始终保持清醒的头脑，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向。上海港务局第三装卸区五个革命群众组织之间一度“内战”打得不可开交。驻在这个单位的毛泽东思想宣传队，就和无产阶级革命派战士一起反复学习毛主席的有关最新指示，用毛主席的最新指示作强大思想武器，分析了全区运动的形势和广大群众的要求，使大家认识到：放着党内一小撮走资派不斗，只顾打“内战”，大方向错了。不按照毛主席的最新指示办事，这是对毛主席最大的不忠。于是，各革命群众组织坐下来充分协商，成立了革命大批判联合委员会，发动广大群众开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，并在大批判中实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    驻沪三军指战员说，帮助广大革命群众直接掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，直接掌握毛主席的最新指示，学会用毛泽东思想去分析一切，统帅一切，这就留下了一支永远不走的毛泽东思想宣传队，这就是对左派广大群众的最有力的支持。
    三、大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，是条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的根本措施。
    毛泽东思想学习班，是学习毛泽东思想，学习毛主席最新指示的最好课堂，是斗私批修的最好战场。驻沪三军从去年九月份开始，根据广大无产阶级革命派的迫切要求，调整组织力量，集中精力协助无产阶级革命派，按系统大办毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，上海工业、交通、农村、财贸、文教等各系统已有几十万人参加了学习班的学习，取得了显著效果。上海仪表电讯工业系统，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，不仅在全市第一个实现了按系统、按部门的革命大联合和革命三结合，而且促使大批革命干部站了出来，全系统百分之六十以上的单位已经建立革命委员会。上海市商业一局五百多个科长以上领导干部在毛泽东思想学习班学习以后，大部分站了出来，全局所属的二十九个单位，有二十四个成立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构。
    驻沪三军执行“三支”“两军”任务的指战员深深体会到：帮助革命群众建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，是办好毛泽东思想学习班的根本的根本，关键的关键。他们首先抓对毛泽东思想的态度问题，使广大学员认识到：学了毛主席最新指示，是照办还是不照办，是执行还是不执行，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的阶级感情问题、根本态度问题。这样，就使参加学习班学习的同志，自觉地、严格地要求自己坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事。上海杨浦区最近举办的一期有中学革命师生、革命教工和革命干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班，在解放军同志帮助下，把发扬毛主席倡导的革命好学风、全面落实毛主席最新指示，作为学习班的头等重要大事。参加学习班学习的同志，遵照毛主席的教导，自觉革命，自觉斗私批修，自己的“辫子”自己剪，自己的“疮疤”自己揭，大大促进了全体学员的思想革命化。学习结束后，派人参加这期学习班学习的十一所中学，都成立了革命委员会，有力地推进了复课闹革命。
    驻沪三军“三支”“两军”工作人员还看到，随着文化大革命运动的深入发展，处在当权地位的革命群众组织的头头，能不能坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能不能胜利发展的一个重要关键，因此，解放军同志很注意组织革命群众组织的头头到学习班学习，用毛泽东思想、用毛主席的最新指示武装他们的头脑，促使他们对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，坚决照办。狠抓头头学习的结果，许多头头从学习班回到基层以后，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓思想政治工作，进一步推动了本单位革命群众的思想革命化，推动了本单位的文化大革命。
    四、三军团结协作，步调一致，是条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的重要保证。
    在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，驻沪三军始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在“三支”“两军”工作中互相尊重，互相配合，互相支持，互相帮助，协同作战，在上海市革命委员会的领导下，做到了工作部署统一，方针政策统一，具体工作步骤统一。在同时有两个军种以上的支左人员的地区和系统（局），他们还协商确定由一个军种统一指挥，做到组织领导的统一。在日常“三支”“两军”工作中，三军建立了经常联系、互相通气、密切协商的制度，及时沟通情况，沟通思想。在有双方参加工作的单位，工作中产生错误的时候，就严格律己，主动承担责任。当社会上有坏人挑拨一部分不明真相的群众，把矛头指向解放军，企图挑拨军队与军队之间关系的时候，他们在处理时特别慎重，做好充分的调查研究工作，与其他军种统一认识后，共同解决问题，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。三军指战员说：三军在毛泽东思想基础上的高度统一，就保证了在“三支”“两军”工作中能够迅速地全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
    五、要真正落实毛主席的最新指示，必须用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，“三支”“两军”的伟大战斗任务，是广大指战员破私立公，改造世界观的大课堂。为了促进思想革命化，驻沪三军参加“三支”“两军”工作的部队普遍建立了“天天读”、
  “党团生活”、“间隙整训”、“定期集训”等制度，经常检查思想，斗私批修。许多毛泽东思想宣传队还自觉地用“五个标准”对照检查自己，这五个标准是：
  （1）无限忠于毛主席的坚定的政治立场；（2）雷厉风行宣传毛泽东思想、宣传毛主席最新指示的饱满的政治热情；（3）勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想、毛主席最新指示的坚强的革命毅力；（4）时时对照毛泽东思想、毛主席最新指示检查自己的严格的自我批评精神；（5）向无产阶级革命派虚心学习的态度。
    驻沪部队参加“三支”“两军”工作的广大指战员，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，经风雨，见世面，虚心地向无产阶级革命派学习，得到了极大的锻炼和改造，涌现出大批先进集体和先进人物。有一个部队参加“三支”“两军”工作的人员，在年终四好总评时，有百分之六十以上被评为活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。
    上海市无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，越来越好，给驻沪三军广大指战员以极大的鼓舞，上海市广大无产阶级革命派的革命精神，给广大指战员以极大的教育。驻沪三军广大指战员通过总结“三支”“两军”工作，更加意气风发、斗志昂扬，决心在新的一年里，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地向上海市无产阶级革命派学习，做学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，把“三支”“两军”工作提高到新的水平。
