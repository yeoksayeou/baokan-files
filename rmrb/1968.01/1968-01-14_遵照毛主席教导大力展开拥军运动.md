The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a military support mobilization meeting and decided to immediately launch a widespread, in-depth, and enthusiastic military support movement throughout the city.

Revolutionary masses from various sectors of the city, including factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools, attended the meeting with deep class sentiments of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They enthusiastically praised the immortal merits of the great People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They resolutely declared that, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "supporting the military and loving the people," they would further improve the military support movement, learn from the military, love the military, assist the military, and trust and rely on the military even more. They would follow the example of the military, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, and ensure that all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented in full.

Attendees included representatives from the revolutionary committees or preparatory committees of various districts and counties, as well as revolutionary masses from factories, rural areas, schools, and institutions, totaling over a thousand people.

Representatives from the various headquarters, military branches, and the National Defense Science and Technology Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as leaders from the Beijing Military Region and the Beijing Garrison, including Zheng Weishan, Huang Zuozhen, Liu Shaowen, and Fan Puquan, attended the meeting.

Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Xie Fuzhi, delivered an important speech. Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Wu De, made a mobilization report to the meeting.

The meeting was filled with a fervent atmosphere of love for the great People's Liberation Army. The revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted slogans such as: "Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call of 'supporting the military and loving the people'!" "Enthusiastically carry out military support activities!" "Swear to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Learn from the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Salute the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the great unity between the military and the people!"

At the beginning of the meeting, the revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

The meeting read out the "Instructions from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee on Carrying Out the Military Support Movement." The instructions stated: The great Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the iron wall defending the socialist motherland, and the strong support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The PLA units stationed in Beijing and the Beijing Garrison have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "believing in and relying on the masses," and followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They have actively done a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work and have achieved great merits in the Cultural Revolution.

The instructions said that 1968 is the year to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the face of the good situation and new combat tasks, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "supporting the military and loving the people," further improving the military support movement, and strengthening the unity between the military and the people have special and strategic significance. This is an important guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The instructions require the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the entire city to follow the example of the PLA, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Learn from the PLA to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the "four firsts," the "three-eight style," and the "three main disciplines and eight points for attention." Seriously rectify thoughts, organizations, styles, and disciplines. Enhance proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois cliques; enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and overcome anarchism.

The instructions emphasize that supporting the People's Liberation Army and trusting and relying on the People's Liberation Army, in practical actions, first of all, fully support and enthusiastically assist the PLA participating in the "three supports and two militaries" work in the local area, department, and unit. The proletarian revolutionary masses should be models of military support, enhance revolutionary vigilance, and firmly prevent class enemies from stirring up military-civilian relations and destroying military-civilian unity. Firmly protect the great wall.

The instructions also require that special attention be paid to grassroots military support activities, taking "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, checking, revising, and implementing military support agreements; doing a good job in caring for military families, families of martyrs, and honorable military personnel, and doing a good job in settling the placement of demobilized and transferred military personnel.
