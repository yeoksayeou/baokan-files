After each session of the study classes in the Double Duck Mountain Mining District, they conduct follow-up visits to the masses to help the students continuously overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Their experience is:

Implementing Study Results Thoroughly

With the strong support of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the Double Duck Mountain Mining District in Heilongjiang Province has held three sessions of study classes, with over five hundred people participating, the majority of whom are cadres. The study classes focus on resolving issues related to the cadres' ideology and the relationship between cadres and the masses. Currently, over 95% of the cadres in the entire mining district have stepped forward, and among the 24 top leaders of the original mines, bureaus, and districts, 20 have taken the initiative to lead the work, and a new relationship between cadres and the masses is beginning to form.

The characteristic of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Double Duck Mountain Mining District is emphasizing the integration of learning and application.

Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, and application is also learning, and it is even more important learning." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in this mining district not only focus on in-class learning but also emphasize post-class application. They believe that post-class application is a more important and better form of learning that must be firmly grasped. After each session of the study classes, they conduct follow-up visits. Through these visits, they supervise the students to implement the study results and help the students continuously revolutionize. They have discovered that some students, after leaving the class, think that leaving the class means they have passed the "test," and from now on, they will be cautious and will not make mistakes. Some comrades have also relaxed their struggle against the slightest selfish thoughts. When encountering difficulties in actual work, they hesitate, and the concerns about making mistakes and facing difficulties, which were emphasized in the study class, have resurfaced. During the follow-up visits, they promptly convey the opinions and feedback from the masses to the students, hold small-scale symposiums, and have individual heart-to-heart talks with the students to supervise and help them continuously overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, fostering a spirit of continuous revolution; they promptly identify and promote good examples. They regard the follow-up visits as a continuation of the study classes. Some study classes re-admit the students who performed well and those who performed poorly into the study classes to learn together with the new students, using their experiences and lessons to help the new students learn well. This way, the students who have left the class feel very satisfied. They say, "The study class is responsible for us to the end. In actual struggles, we must definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively, and dedicate ourselves to the revolution and the struggle against selfishness and revisionism for life."

    双鸭山矿区的每期学习班结束后，都到群众中进行回访工作，帮助学员不断破私立公。他们的经验是：
    认真落实学习成果
    在解放军某部的大力帮助下，黑龙江省双鸭山矿区已经办了三期学习班，五百多人参加了学习，其中绝大部分是干部。学习班着重解决干部思想和干群关系问题。现在全矿区百分之九十五以上的干部站了出来，原井、矿、局的二十四个第一把手中，有二十个站出来抓工作，新的干群关系开始形成。
    双鸭山矿区毛泽东思想学习班的特点是：强调学用结合。
    毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”遵循毛主席的这一伟大教导，这个矿区毛泽东思想学习班，不仅管入班学，而且狠抓出班用。他们认为，出班用，是更好更重要的学习，必须狠抓。在每一期学习班结束以后，他们都进行回访工作。通过回访，督促学员落实学习成果，帮助学员不断革命。他们了解到有的学员出班以后，认为出了班就算过了“关”，今后“慎”字当先，就不会犯错误了。有的同志还放松了对“私”字一闪念的斗争，在实际工作中遇到困难就畏缩，原来在学习班着重检查了的怕犯错误、怕困难的顾虑又有回升。在回访中，他们把群众的意见和反映，及时地转达给学员，开小型座谈会，同学员个别谈心，督促和帮助学员不断破私立公，树立不断革命的思想；了解到好典型，及时抓住，加以宣传推广。他们把回访工作作为学习班的继续。有些学习班把表现好的和表现差的学员，再吸收到学习班里来，和新学员一起学习，用他们的经验教训，帮助新学员学好。这样做，出班的学员感到很满意。他们说，学习班对我们负责到底，在实际斗争中，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，干一辈子革命，斗私批修一辈子。
