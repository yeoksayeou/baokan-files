One Li Wenzhong leads the way, and millions of Li Wenzhongs follow. The deeds of Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, a prominent representative of advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, have spread far and wide, deeply touching the hearts of people. The People's Liberation Army's broad ranks of officers and soldiers, taking the heroes as their models, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry forward the selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, hoist high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and strive to be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will perform new meritorious deeds for the people.

Hero Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong are the shining examples of ideological revolution set by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. Once their deeds were published, they sparked a strong response throughout the country and the army. After Li Wenzhong's report outline and "Li Wenzhong, an Outstanding Representative of Advanced Elements of the Proletariat Continuing the Revolution under Proletarian Dictatorship" were published, the movement to learn from the heroes reached a new high. Broad ranks of officers and soldiers said: The red flag set by our great leader Chairman Mao for us is a major measure to promote the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, complete the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, and other work. Many old cadres excitedly said: After seeing the heroes' deeds, our hearts are stirred, greatly inspiring our selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. In the high tide of learning from the heroes, the troops in Beijing, Jinan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions held oath-taking rallies and discussion meetings. Famous activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, such as Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, Huang Zushi, Mai Xiande, Sun Leyi, Nian Siwang, and Chen Jinyuan, all combined their own experiences in ideological revolution, seriously learned from the heroes, and resolved to be better advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The famous "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," "Red Ninth Company," "Sea Tiger Boat," and the companies where heroes Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Xie Chen, and LÃ¼ Xiangbi once served, along with many other companies, combined the Four Good evaluations, situation education, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and supporting the left and loving the people work, to carry out activities such as learning from the heroes and finding gaps. Currently, on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines, on the front lines of coastal defense, at production and construction sites, and in various positions in administrative departments, the glorious deeds of Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong are praised everywhere, and everyone learns from them.

Through learning the heroic deeds of Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have greatly inspired their thorough revolutionary spirit, resolving to be like Li Wenzhong in being loyal to Chairman Mao with red hearts, following Chairman Mao closely, and being advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The learning of heroes has caused broad ranks of cadres and soldiers to deeply reflect: How to closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao and be advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship? Many units have discussed this issue heatedly.

At the rally to launch a new high tide of learning from the heroes in the Beijing Garrison Command, the officers and soldiers said: To continue the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, to consciously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize, one must seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and measures on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The officers and soldiers of a certain artillery unit in the Jinan Military Region believe that the most important thing in learning from Li Wenzhong is to be like him in firmly believing in and unshakably implementing every latest instruction and every battle order from Chairman Mao. Only in this way, at the critical moment of the revolution's development, can one have a red heart and bright eyes, speak with principles, act with methods, stand firmly, and always advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

Many old cadres, after learning the heroic deeds of comrade Li Wenzhong, were also greatly inspired and educated. They said: Comrade Li Wenzhong's heroic deeds and lofty communist spirit tell us that the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is more profound and arduous than the democratic revolution. To be a thorough revolutionary, one must study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, reform one's ideology for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime. The Party Committee of the 6003 Unit held an expanded meeting, reviewed themselves against the heroes, and some comrades said: In the past, they always thought that after following Chairman Mao in southward and northward campaigns for decades, even if there were no merits, there were still hardships, leading to the mentality of "considering oneself a meritorious person" and "relying on past merits," relaxing ideological reform, and thus failing to keep up with the constantly developing new situation. The leading cadres of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region said: Failing to keep up with the constantly developing new situation often leads to deviations from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line when observing and handling problems. After learning, many old cadres raised their awareness and were full of fighting spirit. They said: Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental awakening, the purest party nature, the most noble quality, and the greatest good. We are old warriors of the democratic revolution, but also new soldiers of the socialist revolution. We must study Chairman Mao's books to old age, use them to old age, and achieve red thoughts until old age, learn from the heroes, perform new meritorious deeds, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and be advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship.

Under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, through learning the report outline of Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong, have strongly promoted the mass movement of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism to develop deeply.

The officers and soldiers believe that Li Wenzhong's "don't mind me" concentrates the selfless revolutionary spirit of countless advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. To be like Li Wenzhong, loyal to Chairman Mao with red hearts, following Chairman Mao closely, and becoming advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, one must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly expose, fiercely fight, and resolutely reform the "self," and work hard on reforming one's worldview.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines deeply feel that the "self" is the biggest obstacle and the biggest enemy in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Only by thoroughly defeating the "self" can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be implemented without the slightest deviation. A certain reconnaissance company's deputy squad leader, Pi Xianhua, went to a grassroots enterprise unit to carry out tasks. Here, there were two revolutionary mass organizations in serious opposition. At first, due to the interference of the "self," Pi Xianhua was afraid of being attacked and was not bold enough in propagating revolutionary great unity. After learning from Li Wenzhong, he defeated the "self" and resolved to be like Li Wenzhong, "defending Chairman Mao, even if dying, I am content," immediately propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the two revolutionary mass organizations, patiently did ideological and political work, and helped them quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. A certain artillery company in the Beijing Military Region's artillery battalion had a training team that was transferred from a middle school to a primary school, developing a sense of superiority. They felt that their work in supporting the left was not bad in the past year, and primary schools were easier to handle than middle schools, so they spoke less carefully and worked less diligently. Under the inspiration of comrade Li Wenzhong's selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, conducted a rectification, launched an attack on the "self," actively helped the school hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcame the factionalism of revolutionary mass organizations, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Through the practical experience of supporting the left, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers deeply felt that the more the revolution advances, the more it profoundly touches people's souls, and the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's "public" and the bourgeoisie's "self" becomes. Only by thoroughly defeating the "self" in one's head and completely reforming one's worldview can one follow Chairman Mao to carry the revolution through to the end.

Combining the learning of comrade Li Wenzhong's report outline, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers launched a new high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. A certain mechanized company's second platoon's eighth squad, based on some comrades' active thoughts of fearing pain and not daring to fight selfishness fiercely, proposed: Fighting selfishness should use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and achieve: first, an offensive battle, taking the initiative to attack, directly hitting the center; second, a decisive battle, racing against time; third, an annihilation battle, leaving no aftermath; fourth, a "people's war," openly exposing and fighting, internally and externally attacking. Everyone resolved to revolutionize for a lifetime, reform one's worldview for a lifetime, never stopping, never being satisfied, truly letting Mao Zedong Thought command every second of one's life. The leading cadres of the 6024 Unit's artillery battalion on the supporting the left front line took the lead in learning from the heroes, finding gaps, fiercely fighting the "self," and shocking the soul. Originally, there were some problems between the Party Committees, which were not openly discussed and debated enough, feeling that mutual tension would damage prestige. After learning from hero Li Wenzhong, the Party Committees used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to expose, fight, and reform the "self," resolving to blow up the "self" fortress like blowing up enemy bunkers on the battlefield. Many comrades examined thoughts such as "relying on past merits." The Party Committee secretary recalled that before joining the revolution, he was a cowherd, and now as a leading cadre, he neglected Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, shedding hot tears. Everyone deeply realized that the "self" is the source of all evil, the big enemy obstructing the continuation of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship; the more selfishness is fought, the closer one follows Chairman Mao; only by completely and thoroughly fighting selfishness can one follow our great leader Chairman Mao closely.

Learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers more consciously grasp the key points, raising the struggle against selfishness and establishing public spirit to the height of the struggle between the two lines. Some comrades in the 622 Unit's anti-aircraft artillery company previously thought that since the company did not undertake supporting the left tasks, ideological reform did not pay attention to the line struggle. After learning comrade Li Wenzhong's report outline and reviewing Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, everyone realized: Although we did not take on supporting the left work, we are in the midst of class struggle, and the class struggle in society is constantly reflected in our minds. If fighting selfishness only focuses on minor issues, one will lose direction in the waves of class struggle and will not be able to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the Four Good evaluations, the entire company fought selfishness by focusing on major issues, being strict, and having a new spirit.

Inspired by comrade Li Wenzhong's selfless revolutionary spirit, a great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and broadly has been launched. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, taking Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong as their models, hoist high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," carry forward the revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice, and regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the best and most practical actions of learning from the heroes. In the activity of deeply learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, the Shenyang Military Region regards arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest love for the people, organizing more than a thousand Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into urban streets, widely propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to residents, and helping residents properly arrange household affairs, and appropriately setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes suitable for street residents to participate in. Some housewives previously studied less and often viewed things within the small circle of the family and individual, but after learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, their awareness has fundamentally improved. After learning the heroes' deeds, the 6618 Unit sent a large number of people to rural areas where they are stationed to widely propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launch a wave of revolutionary criticism in rural areas, and greatly enhance the enthusiasm of the broad masses of community members in seizing the revolution and promoting production. Each production team in the locality completed and overfulfilled the state procurement tasks at the fastest speed.

Many units, through learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, also reviewed the experience of supporting the left work in light of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, widely solicited the opinions of revolutionary masses, checked and revised the "love the people agreement," strengthened military-civilian unity, and raised the supporting the left and loving the people work to a new level. Recently, the supporting the left personnel of the 8108 Unit, taking comrade Li Wenzhong as their model and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, mobilized revolutionary masses to democratically evaluate supporting the left work. At first, the masses mentioned more achievements and fewer problems, more praise and less criticism, so the comrades in the unit studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with the masses and again expressed their sincere attitude of accepting the masses' opinions. Some supporting the left personnel also went to the masses to actively fight selfishness, make self-examinations, and actively seek opinions. The masses were deeply moved, giving the unit many precious opinions, helping the supporting the left personnel of the unit find problems, summarize experiences, and better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the 3rd Artillery Company stationed in Qingdao learned from comrade Li Wenzhong, seriously checked the supporting the left work, fought off the "fear," and resolutely executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practical actions. After this station achieved revolutionary great unity, there were again disagreements and oppositions among the revolutionary mass organizations. Previously, the comrades of the 3rd Company did not handle it in time, but now they actively found revolutionary masses with different views to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions, insisting on the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions." Deputy squad leader Lian Jiqing talked to a station service worker twice, both times encountering rebuffs. He thought of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on ideological and political work and the glorious example of Li Wenzhong, and continued to have heart-to-heart talks with this service worker, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism together, finally persuading the other party. With the help of the 3rd Artillery Company, the station held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticized factionalism, consolidated revolutionary great unity from the ideological level, grasped the revolution, and promoted production, completing the 1967 production plan ahead of schedule. Currently, the station is deeply carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, presenting a great revolutionary situation.

Learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong has strongly promoted the deep development of the army's movement of supporting the army and loving the people, appearing many moving deeds of supporting the left and loving the people. Not long ago, the leading organ of the Beijing Garrison Command commended a batch of advanced collectives and individuals who took comrade Li Wenzhong as their model and resolutely executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers believe that Chairman Mao's latest instructions, when directly grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force. It is precisely under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao that there are countless proletarian revolutionary warriors like comrade Li Wenzhong, who resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has presented a great situation. Everyone strives to be an advanced element of the proletariat like Li Wenzhong, which will make Chairman Mao's latest instructions implemented faster, better, and more comprehensively. The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (Accompanying picture)
