One Li Wenzhong leads the way, and millions of Li Wenzhongs follow. The deeds of Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, a prominent representative of advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, have spread far and wide, deeply touching the hearts of people. The People's Liberation Army's broad ranks of officers and soldiers, taking the heroes as their models, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry forward the selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, hoist high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and strive to be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will perform new meritorious deeds for the people.

Hero Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong are the shining examples of ideological revolution set by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. Once their deeds were published, they sparked a strong response throughout the country and the army. After Li Wenzhong's report outline and "Li Wenzhong, an Outstanding Representative of Advanced Elements of the Proletariat Continuing the Revolution under Proletarian Dictatorship" were published, the movement to learn from the heroes reached a new high. Broad ranks of officers and soldiers said: The red flag set by our great leader Chairman Mao for us is a major measure to promote the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, complete the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, and other work. Many old cadres excitedly said: After seeing the heroes' deeds, our hearts are stirred, greatly inspiring our selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. In the high tide of learning from the heroes, the troops in Beijing, Jinan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions held oath-taking rallies and discussion meetings. Famous activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, such as Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, Huang Zushi, Mai Xiande, Sun Leyi, Nian Siwang, and Chen Jinyuan, all combined their own experiences in ideological revolution, seriously learned from the heroes, and resolved to be better advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The famous "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," "Red Ninth Company," "Sea Tiger Boat," and the companies where heroes Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Xie Chen, and Lü Xiangbi once served, along with many other companies, combined the Four Good evaluations, situation education, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and supporting the left and loving the people work, to carry out activities such as learning from the heroes and finding gaps. Currently, on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines, on the front lines of coastal defense, at production and construction sites, and in various positions in administrative departments, the glorious deeds of Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong are praised everywhere, and everyone learns from them.

Through learning the heroic deeds of Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have greatly inspired their thorough revolutionary spirit, resolving to be like Li Wenzhong in being loyal to Chairman Mao with red hearts, following Chairman Mao closely, and being advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The learning of heroes has caused broad ranks of cadres and soldiers to deeply reflect: How to closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao and be advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship? Many units have discussed this issue heatedly.

At the rally to launch a new high tide of learning from the heroes in the Beijing Garrison Command, the officers and soldiers said: To continue the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, to consciously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize, one must seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and measures on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The officers and soldiers of a certain artillery unit in the Jinan Military Region believe that the most important thing in learning from Li Wenzhong is to be like him in firmly believing in and unshakably implementing every latest instruction and every battle order from Chairman Mao. Only in this way, at the critical moment of the revolution's development, can one have a red heart and bright eyes, speak with principles, act with methods, stand firmly, and always advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

Many old cadres, after learning the heroic deeds of comrade Li Wenzhong, were also greatly inspired and educated. They said: Comrade Li Wenzhong's heroic deeds and lofty communist spirit tell us that the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is more profound and arduous than the democratic revolution. To be a thorough revolutionary, one must study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, reform one's ideology for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime. The Party Committee of the 6003 Unit held an expanded meeting, reviewed themselves against the heroes, and some comrades said: In the past, they always thought that after following Chairman Mao in southward and northward campaigns for decades, even if there were no merits, there were still hardships, leading to the mentality of "considering oneself a meritorious person" and "relying on past merits," relaxing ideological reform, and thus failing to keep up with the constantly developing new situation. The leading cadres of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region said: Failing to keep up with the constantly developing new situation often leads to deviations from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line when observing and handling problems. After learning, many old cadres raised their awareness and were full of fighting spirit. They said: Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental awakening, the purest party nature, the most noble quality, and the greatest good. We are old warriors of the democratic revolution, but also new soldiers of the socialist revolution. We must study Chairman Mao's books to old age, use them to old age, and achieve red thoughts until old age, learn from the heroes, perform new meritorious deeds, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and be advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship.

Under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, through learning the report outline of Fourth Platoon and comrade Li Wenzhong, have strongly promoted the mass movement of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism to develop deeply.

The officers and soldiers believe that Li Wenzhong's "don't mind me" concentrates the selfless revolutionary spirit of countless advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. To be like Li Wenzhong, loyal to Chairman Mao with red hearts, following Chairman Mao closely, and becoming advanced elements of the proletariat continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, one must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly expose, fiercely fight, and resolutely reform the "self," and work hard on reforming one's worldview.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines deeply feel that the "self" is the biggest obstacle and the biggest enemy in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Only by thoroughly defeating the "self" can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be implemented without the slightest deviation. A certain reconnaissance company's deputy squad leader, Pi Xianhua, went to a grassroots enterprise unit to carry out tasks. Here, there were two revolutionary mass organizations in serious opposition. At first, due to the interference of the "self," Pi Xianhua was afraid of being attacked and was not bold enough in propagating revolutionary great unity. After learning from Li Wenzhong, he defeated the "self" and resolved to be like Li Wenzhong, "defending Chairman Mao, even if dying, I am content," immediately propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the two revolutionary mass organizations, patiently did ideological and political work, and helped them quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. A certain artillery company in the Beijing Military Region's artillery battalion had a training team that was transferred from a middle school to a primary school, developing a sense of superiority. They felt that their work in supporting the left was not bad in the past year, and primary schools were easier to handle than middle schools, so they spoke less carefully and worked less diligently. Under the inspiration of comrade Li Wenzhong's selfless spirit of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, conducted a rectification, launched an attack on the "self," actively helped the school hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcame the factionalism of revolutionary mass organizations, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Through the practical experience of supporting the left, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers deeply felt that the more the revolution advances, the more it profoundly touches people's souls, and the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's "public" and the bourgeoisie's "self" becomes. Only by thoroughly defeating the "self" in one's head and completely reforming one's worldview can one follow Chairman Mao to carry the revolution through to the end.

Combining the learning of comrade Li Wenzhong's report outline, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers launched a new high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. A certain mechanized company's second platoon's eighth squad, based on some comrades' active thoughts of fearing pain and not daring to fight selfishness fiercely, proposed: Fighting selfishness should use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and achieve: first, an offensive battle, taking the initiative to attack, directly hitting the center; second, a decisive battle, racing against time; third, an annihilation battle, leaving no aftermath; fourth, a "people's war," openly exposing and fighting, internally and externally attacking. Everyone resolved to revolutionize for a lifetime, reform one's worldview for a lifetime, never stopping, never being satisfied, truly letting Mao Zedong Thought command every second of one's life. The leading cadres of the 6024 Unit's artillery battalion on the supporting the left front line took the lead in learning from the heroes, finding gaps, fiercely fighting the "self," and shocking the soul. Originally, there were some problems between the Party Committees, which were not openly discussed and debated enough, feeling that mutual tension would damage prestige. After learning from hero Li Wenzhong, the Party Committees used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to expose, fight, and reform the "self," resolving to blow up the "self" fortress like blowing up enemy bunkers on the battlefield. Many comrades examined thoughts such as "relying on past merits." The Party Committee secretary recalled that before joining the revolution, he was a cowherd, and now as a leading cadre, he neglected Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, shedding hot tears. Everyone deeply realized that the "self" is the source of all evil, the big enemy obstructing the continuation of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship; the more selfishness is fought, the closer one follows Chairman Mao; only by completely and thoroughly fighting selfishness can one follow our great leader Chairman Mao closely.

Learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers more consciously grasp the key points, raising the struggle against selfishness and establishing public spirit to the height of the struggle between the two lines. Some comrades in the 622 Unit's anti-aircraft artillery company previously thought that since the company did not undertake supporting the left tasks, ideological reform did not pay attention to the line struggle. After learning comrade Li Wenzhong's report outline and reviewing Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, everyone realized: Although we did not take on supporting the left work, we are in the midst of class struggle, and the class struggle in society is constantly reflected in our minds. If fighting selfishness only focuses on minor issues, one will lose direction in the waves of class struggle and will not be able to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the Four Good evaluations, the entire company fought selfishness by focusing on major issues, being strict, and having a new spirit.

Inspired by comrade Li Wenzhong's selfless revolutionary spirit, a great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and broadly has been launched. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, taking Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong as their models, hoist high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," carry forward the revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice, and regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the best and most practical actions of learning from the heroes. In the activity of deeply learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, the Shenyang Military Region regards arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest love for the people, organizing more than a thousand Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into urban streets, widely propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to residents, and helping residents properly arrange household affairs, and appropriately setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes suitable for street residents to participate in. Some housewives previously studied less and often viewed things within the small circle of the family and individual, but after learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, their awareness has fundamentally improved. After learning the heroes' deeds, the 6618 Unit sent a large number of people to rural areas where they are stationed to widely propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launch a wave of revolutionary criticism in rural areas, and greatly enhance the enthusiasm of the broad masses of community members in seizing the revolution and promoting production. Each production team in the locality completed and overfulfilled the state procurement tasks at the fastest speed.

Many units, through learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, also reviewed the experience of supporting the left work in light of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, widely solicited the opinions of revolutionary masses, checked and revised the "love the people agreement," strengthened military-civilian unity, and raised the supporting the left and loving the people work to a new level. Recently, the supporting the left personnel of the 8108 Unit, taking comrade Li Wenzhong as their model and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, mobilized revolutionary masses to democratically evaluate supporting the left work. At first, the masses mentioned more achievements and fewer problems, more praise and less criticism, so the comrades in the unit studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with the masses and again expressed their sincere attitude of accepting the masses' opinions. Some supporting the left personnel also went to the masses to actively fight selfishness, make self-examinations, and actively seek opinions. The masses were deeply moved, giving the unit many precious opinions, helping the supporting the left personnel of the unit find problems, summarize experiences, and better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the 3rd Artillery Company stationed in Qingdao learned from comrade Li Wenzhong, seriously checked the supporting the left work, fought off the "fear," and resolutely executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practical actions. After this station achieved revolutionary great unity, there were again disagreements and oppositions among the revolutionary mass organizations. Previously, the comrades of the 3rd Company did not handle it in time, but now they actively found revolutionary masses with different views to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions, insisting on the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions." Deputy squad leader Lian Jiqing talked to a station service worker twice, both times encountering rebuffs. He thought of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on ideological and political work and the glorious example of Li Wenzhong, and continued to have heart-to-heart talks with this service worker, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism together, finally persuading the other party. With the help of the 3rd Artillery Company, the station held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticized factionalism, consolidated revolutionary great unity from the ideological level, grasped the revolution, and promoted production, completing the 1967 production plan ahead of schedule. Currently, the station is deeply carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, presenting a great revolutionary situation.

Learning from Hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong has strongly promoted the deep development of the army's movement of supporting the army and loving the people, appearing many moving deeds of supporting the left and loving the people. Not long ago, the leading organ of the Beijing Garrison Command commended a batch of advanced collectives and individuals who took comrade Li Wenzhong as their model and resolutely executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers believe that Chairman Mao's latest instructions, when directly grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force. It is precisely under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao that there are countless proletarian revolutionary warriors like comrade Li Wenzhong, who resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has presented a great situation. Everyone strives to be an advanced element of the proletariat like Li Wenzhong, which will make Chairman Mao's latest instructions implemented faster, better, and more comprehensively. The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! (Accompanying picture)

    毛主席为全国军民树立的红旗胜利飘扬
    三军指战员决心以英雄四排和李文忠为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的忘我精神，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中为人民立新功
    新华社十九日讯　《解放军报》报道：一个李文忠走在先，千万个李文忠跟上来。英雄四排和无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子的突出代表李文忠的事迹，传遍天南海北，日益深入人心。人民解放军广大指战员以英雄为榜样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的忘我精神，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，鼓足干劲，力争上游，争当学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的斗争中，为人民立新功。
    英雄四排和李文忠同志，是伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席为我们树立的思想革命化的光辉榜样。他们的事迹一发表，就在全国全军引起了强烈的反响。李文忠同志的思想汇报提纲和《无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子的突出代表李文忠》刊登以后，更把学习英雄的活动推向新的高潮。广大指战员说：伟大领袖毛主席为我们树立的这面红旗，是推动全面落实毛主席最新指示，完成“三支”“两军”任务和其它各项工作的重大措施。许多老干部激动地说：看了英雄的事迹，心中久久不能平静，大大激励了我们在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的忘我精神。在学习英雄的高潮中，北京、济南、江西、上海、天津、福州、南京、武汉、广州、沈阳、兰州、成都、昆明等地区部队和新疆、西藏军区广大指战员，分别举行了誓师大会和座谈会。著名的学习毛主席著作积极分子廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示、麦贤得、孙乐义、年四旺、陈金元等，都结合自己思想革命化的体会，认真向英雄学习，决心更好地做一个无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子。“南京路上好八连”、“红九连”、“海上猛虎艇”，雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、谢臣、吕祥璧等英雄生前所在班和广大连队，分别结合四好总评、形势教育、办毛泽东思想学习班和支左爱民工作，展开学英雄找差距等活动。目前，在“三支”“两军”第一线，在海边防的最前哨，在生产施工的现场，在机关部门各个岗位上，处处传颂、人人学习英雄四排和李文忠的光辉事迹。
      对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，做无产
  阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子
    通过学习四排和李文忠同志的英雄事迹，大大激发了广大指战员的彻底革命精神，决心象李文忠那样对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。学习英雄，引起了广大干部、战士的深思：如何紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，做一个无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子？许多部队就这个问题展开热烈讨论。
    北京卫戍区在举行掀起学习英雄的新高潮的大会上，指战员们说，要在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命，自觉革命，彻底革命，就必须认真学习和贯彻毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的一整套理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。济南部队炮兵某部指战员们认为，学习李文忠，最重要的就是象他那样对毛主席的每个最新指示，每个战斗号令，都坚信不疑、坚定不移地条条落实，全面落实。只有这样，在革命向前发展的关键时刻，才能心红眼亮，说话有纲，办事有方，立场坚定，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
    许多老干部学习了英雄李文忠的事迹后，也受到很大的启发和教育。他们说，李文忠同志的英雄事迹和崇高的共产主义精神告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下的革命比民主革命更为深刻、更为艰巨。要做一个彻底革命者，必须学一辈子毛主席的著作，改造一辈子思想，干一辈子革命。六○○三部队党委召开扩大会议，对照英雄检查自己，一些同志说：过去总认为跟毛主席南征北战几十年，没有功劳也有苦劳，产生了“功臣自居”、“吃老本”的思想，放松了思想改造，结果就使自己不能紧跟不断发展的新形势。广州部队某部领导干部们说：跟不上不断发展的新形势，观察和处理问题时就往往违背了毛主席的革命路线。经过学习，许多老干部认识提高，斗志昂扬。他们说，无限忠于毛主席，是最根本的立场，最根本的觉悟，最纯洁的党性，最高贵的品质，最大的好。我们是进行民主革命的老战士，但又是进行社会主义革命的新兵。对毛主席的书要学到老，用到老，做到鬓发白，思想红，学英雄，立新功，发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，做一个无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子。
      对“私”字打进攻战，彻底改造世界观，发扬无
  产阶级专政下继续进行革命的忘我精神
    在伟大领袖毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召下，广大指战员通过学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的思想汇报提纲，有力地推动了斗私批修的群众运动深入发展。
    指战员们认为，李文忠同志的“不要管我”，集中体现了无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无数无产阶级先进分子忘我的革命精神。要象李文忠同志那样，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，成为无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对“私”字彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员深深体会到，“私”字是执行毛主席最新指示的最大障碍，最大的敌人，只有彻底地斗倒“私”字，才能不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示。某部侦察连副班长皮贤华到一个基层企业单位执行任务。这里有两个革命群众组织严重对立，开始由于“私”字作怪，皮贤华怕受围攻，宣传革命大联合时不够大胆。学习李文忠，斗倒了“私”字，他决心象李文忠那样，“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心”，立即向两个革命群众组织宣传毛主席最新指示，耐心做思想政治工作，帮助他们很快实现了革命大联合。北京部队某部炮兵八连一个军训小组，由中学调到小学后，产生了骄傲情绪。他们觉得一年来支左工作不错，小学比中学好搞，于是说话不大注意了，工作也不象以前那样艰苦了。在李文忠同志的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的忘我精神鼓舞下，他们活学活用毛主席著作，进行了一次整风，向“私”字发起猛攻，积极帮助学校办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，克服革命群众组织的派性，使这个学校很快实现了革命大联合。通过支左工作的切身体验，广大指战员深深体会到，革命越向前发展，就越是深刻地触及到人们的灵魂，无产阶级的“公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的冲突就越突出。只有把革自己头脑中“私”字的命进行到底，把世界观的改造进行到底，才能紧跟毛主席将革命进行到底。
    结合学习李文忠同志的思想汇报提纲，广大指战员掀起斗私批修的新高潮。某部机械二连八班根据有些同志斗私怕疼、不敢狠斗的活思想，提出：斗私要以毛泽东思想为武器，做到：一打进攻战，主动出击，直插中心；二打速决战，只争朝夕；三打歼灭战，决不留后患；四打“人民战争”，公开亮，公开斗，内外夹攻。大家决心干一辈子革命，改造一辈子世界观，永不停息，永不自满，真正让毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟。在支左前线的六○二四部队炮兵某部领导干部，带头学英雄找差距，狠斗“私”字，猛触灵魂。原先党委之间存在一些问题，摆出来进行思想交锋不够，觉得互相搞得紧紧张张的，有损威信。学习英雄李文忠，党委之间以“老三篇”为武器，对“私”字进行了亮斗改，决心象当年在战场上炸敌人碉堡一样，把“私”字这个顽固堡垒打个稀巴烂。不少同志检查了“吃老本”等思想。党委书记回忆起自己参加革命前是个放牛娃，如今当了领导干部，却忽视了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，沉痛地流出了热泪。大家深深认识到，“私”字是万恶之源，是阻碍在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的大敌；私心斗掉一分，跟毛主席就紧一步，完全彻底地斗掉私心，才能寸步不离地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席。
    学习英雄四排和李文忠，广大指战员更加自觉地抓大节，把破私立公提高到两条路线斗争的高度。六二二一部队高炮连一些同志，过去认为连队没有担负支左任务，改造思想不注意上路线斗争的纲。学习了李文忠同志的思想汇报提纲，重温了毛主席的有关教导，大家认识到：我们虽然没有担任支左工作，但处在阶级斗争之中，社会上的阶级斗争不断地反映到我们头脑中来。如果斗私光抓小节，就要在阶级斗争的风浪中迷失方向，就不能坚定地站在毛主席革命路线上。在四好总评中，全连斗私注意了抓大节，严要求，精神面貌焕然一新。
    学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功
    在英雄李文忠同志忘我革命精神的鼓舞下，一个活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大的群众运动，更加深入广泛地开展起来。广大指战员以英雄四排和李文忠为榜样，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，发扬理论联系实际的革命好学风，把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示，当成学习英雄的最好最实际的行动。沈阳部队在深入学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的活动中，把用毛泽东思想武装群众看成是最大的爱民，组成了一千多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到城镇街道，广泛向居民宣传毛主席的最新指示，并帮助居民妥善安排好家务，因地制宜地办好适合街道居民参加的毛泽东思想学习班。有些家庭妇女过去学习少，看待事物往往局限在家庭和个人小圈子里，经过学习毛主席的最新指示，开展斗私批修，从根本上提高了觉悟。六六一八部队学习英雄事迹以后，派出大批人员深入驻地农村广泛宣传毛主席最新指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班，掀起农村革命大批判的热潮，极大地提高了广大社员抓革命促生产的积极性。当地各生产队都以最快速度完成和超额完成国家征购任务。
    许多部队通过学习英雄四排和李文忠同志，还对照毛主席一系列最新指示，总结了支左工作经验，并广泛征求革命群众的意见，检查和重新修订了“爱民公约”，加强了军民团结，把支左爱民工作提高到新的水平。八一○八部队支左人员最近以英雄李文忠为榜样，以毛主席最新指示为纲，发动革命群众民主讲评支左工作。开始，群众提成绩多，谈问题少，表扬多，批评少，部队同志便和群众一起学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导，再次表明诚心接受群众意见的态度。有些支左人员还到群众中主动斗私心、作检查，主动找上门征求意见。群众深受感动，给部队提出许多宝贵意见，使部队支左人员找出问题，总结经验，更好地贯彻毛主席的最新指示。驻青岛地区某车站机炮三连毛泽东思想宣传队，学习英雄李文忠，认真检查了支左工作，斗掉了“怕”字，坚决以实际行动执行毛主席最新指示。这个车站实现革命大联合以后，革命群众组织之间又有了分歧和对立，过去三连同志没有及时处理，现在他们主动找有不同观点的革命群众学习毛主席最新指示，坚持“支左不支派”的原则。副班长连吉庆找一个车站服务员谈了两次，两次碰了钉子。他想到毛主席关于做思想政治工作的最新指示，想到李文忠的光辉榜样，又接连和这个服务员谈心，一起斗私批修，终于说服了对方。在机炮三连的帮助下，车站大办毛泽东思想学习班，搞臭派性，从思想上巩固了革命大联合，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前完成了一九六七年的生产计划。目前车站正深入开展本单位的斗、批、改，呈现出一派大好的革命形势。
    学习英雄四排和李文忠同志，有力地促进了部队拥军爱民运动的深入开展，出现了许许多多支左爱民的动人事迹。不久以前，北京卫戍区领导机关曾表扬了一批以英雄李文忠为榜样，坚决执行毛主席最新指示的先进集体和个人。广大指战员认为，毛主席的最新指示为广大群众所直接掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量。正是由于在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，有千千万万个象李文忠同志这样的无产阶级革命战士，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，我国无产阶级文化大革命才出现了一派大好形势。人人争当李文忠这样的无产阶级先进分子，就能使毛主席的最新指示更快、更好、更全面地落实。毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！（附图片）
