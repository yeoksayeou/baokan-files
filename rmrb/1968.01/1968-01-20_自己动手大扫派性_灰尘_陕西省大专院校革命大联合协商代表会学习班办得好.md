The study class for the revolutionary united front negotiation representatives of higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province, held by the Shaanxi Provincial Higher Education Institutions Revolutionary United Front Negotiation Conference, has established a revolutionary learning atmosphere, implemented the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, and vigorously fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to strengthen proletarian party spirit. This has effectively consolidated and developed the revolutionary united front.

The 22 representatives from two factions of revolutionary mass organizations from higher education institutions who participated in this study class had a significant emotional gap due to prolonged "internal warfare." At the beginning of the study, they were wary of each other and rarely spoke. In response to this situation, the PLA leftist cadres and the representatives studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together: "The two factions should talk less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes. Let others speak for themselves, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." After repeated study, everyone implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions, and the atmosphere of the study class changed significantly. Everyone took the initiative to regard themselves as the object of revolution, sincerely examined their own shortcomings and mistakes, swept away their own "dust," and exposed their own "sores." They did not blame others. Chairman Mao's instructions on carrying out heart-to-heart talks are very good. They extensively carried out heart-to-heart talks. Those with greater emotional gaps took the initiative to sincerely talk to them. Many people who used to compete for credit now "compete" to take responsibility. In the past, they endlessly pursued the responsibility of the other side on some issues, but now they take the initiative to assume responsibility. They have "three highs" towards themselves: high standards for self-demands, high style for self-examination, and high posture for correcting mistakes. In this way, the more they talked, the more comfortable they felt, the more their views converged, and the more harmonious their emotions became. They implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their actions, combining learning with practice. In a few days, the opposing emotions were eliminated, the atmosphere of unity became stronger, and the desire for revolutionary united front was even stronger.

Everyone realized from more than a year of struggle that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone linked the reality and their thoughts, exposed the crimes of factionalism, and dug out the roots of factionalism. They painfully felt that in the past, because of factionalism, they could not listen to Chairman Mao's words, study Chairman Mao's works, or implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit has become a common demand. They laid out their factionalism on the table and in front of revolutionary comrades, making factionalism a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts to beat, driving it out of hiding and fighting it until it stinks. The "secret intelligence" and "battle plans" that both sides had previously made from the perspective of factionalism were also completely exposed and used as live teaching materials for their education.

The participants also realized that the root of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the character of "self." Wherever "self" plays tricks, factionalism swells, and small-groupism and anarchist thoughts spread. Therefore, they extensively studied and applied the "Five Articles," fought against "self," combined learning with practice, and saw immediate results. Three higher education institutions in the Xi'an area, whose two factions of revolutionary mass organizations had not united, had their leaders in the study class use the "Five Articles" as weapons, fight against "self," and overthrow factionalism, reaching a consensus on the issue of achieving revolutionary united front. However, when they returned to their schools, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who did not participate in the study class had doubts about the achievements they made in the study class, and there was still a gap between the two factions. The representatives from the three schools who participated in the study class believed that the gap between the two factions was largely caused by the factionalism of the leaders of both factions. The leaders should go to the masses to conduct self-criticism. Wherever they sowed the seeds of factionalism, they should go there to uproot the roots of factionalism. They said that fighting against "self" among the masses has the most teachers, the most lively teaching materials, and the fastest improvement. Therefore, they took the initiative to go to the masses to examine their shortcomings and mistakes, report their study achievements, listen to the opinions of the masses, and propagate the great significance of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They did this and achieved immediate results. The three schools recently all achieved revolutionary united front.

Now, the representatives of revolutionary mass organizations from various higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province who participated in the study class are studying and negotiating the preparation for the convening of the Shaanxi Provincial Higher Education Institutions Red Representative Congress with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone is determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop the revolutionary united front and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and make new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    自己动手大扫派性“灰尘”
    陕西省大专院校革命大联合协商代表会学习班办得好
    新华社西安十九日电　陕西省大专院校革命大联合协商代表会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，建立革命好学风，落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，有力地巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    在这个学习班学习的二十二所大专院校两派革命群众组织的代表，由于长期“打内战”，思想感情上存在着很大隔阂。开始学习时，互有戒心，很少发言。针对这种情况，解放军支左人员和他们一起学习毛主席最新指示：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”大家经过反复学习，把毛主席的这一最新指示落实在自己的行动上，学习班的局面就大变了。大家主动把自己当作革命的对象，诚恳地检查自己的缺点、错误，自己的“灰尘”自己扫，自己的“疮疤”自己揭，互不指责别人。毛主席指示，开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。他们就广泛地开展谈心活动。同谁隔阂大，就主动诚恳地找谁谈心。许多人过去争功，现在“争过”；过去在一些问题上无休止地追究对方的责任，现在自己主动承担责任。他们对待自己有“三高”：要求自己标准高，检查自己风格高，改正错误姿态高。这样，他们越谈心情越舒畅，越谈观点越接近，越谈感情越融洽。他们把毛主席最新指示落实在自己的行动上，学用结合，几天的功夫，对立情绪就消除了，团结气氛浓厚了，实现革命大联合的愿望更加强烈了。
    大家从一年多来的斗争中深切地体会到，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是落实毛主席最新指示的大敌。大家联系实际，联系思想，大摆派性的罪状，大挖派性的老根。他们痛切地感到，过去，因为有了派性，毛主席的话听不进，毛主席著作学不好，毛主席最新指示不落实。因此，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，已成为大家的共同要求。他们把自己的派性亮在桌子面上，摆在革命战友面前，使派性成为过街的老鼠，人人喊打，打得它无处藏身，斗得它臭不可闻。双方过去从派性出发搞的“机密情报”和“作战方案”等等，也都全盘端出，当作教育自己的活教材。
    参加学习的同志还体会到，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的老根，就是一个“私”字。那里“私”字作怪，那里派性就膨胀，小团体主义、无政府主义思想就泛滥。于是，他们大学大用“老五篇”，狠斗私字，学用结合，立竿见影。西安地区有三个高等院校的两派革命群众组织，一直没有联合起来。这三个学校两大派负责人在学习班里以“老五篇”为武器，狠斗私字，打倒派性，就实现革命大联合问题取得了一致的意见。但是，当他们回到学校以后，有的未参加学习班的革命群众组织负责人对他们在学习班所取得的收获抱着怀疑态度，两派群众之间也还存在着隔阂。三个学校参加学习班的同志认为，两派群众之间的隔阂，很大程度上是两派头头们的派性造成的，头头应该到群众中去进行自我批评，自己在那里撒下了派性的种子，就到那里去挖派性的根子。他们说，到群众中去斗私，教员最多，教材最活，提高最快。于是，他们主动到群众中去检查缺点、错误，向群众汇报学习收获，听取群众意见，宣传落实毛主席最新指示的重大意义。他们这样做，收到了立竿见影的效果，三个学校最近都实现了革命大联合。
    现在，参加学习班学习的陕西各大专院校革命群众组织的代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，正在边学习，边协商筹备召开陕西省大专院校红代会的问题。大家决心条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
