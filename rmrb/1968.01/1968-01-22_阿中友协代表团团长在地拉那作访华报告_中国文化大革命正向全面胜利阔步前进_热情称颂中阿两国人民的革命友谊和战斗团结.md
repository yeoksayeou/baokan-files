The Albania-China Friendship Association held a report meeting in Tirana on the 18th. Shyqyri Peçi, head of the delegation of the Albania-China Friendship Association, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Minister of the Ministry of Unattached Departments, recently returned from a visit to China, gave a report on his visit to China at the meeting. He enthusiastically discussed the delegation's observations in China of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that the Chinese people are currently experiencing, and the great achievements of China's socialist construction. He also enthusiastically praised the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Comrade Peçi first spoke about the extremely warm welcome the delegation received in China and the deep affection the Chinese people have for the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people, and their great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Peçi said, "We personally saw that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories. It has thoroughly smashed the dreams of the revisionists and imperialists to restore capitalism in China. Now, revolutionary committees are being rapidly established everywhere in China, and the struggle against selfishness and revisionism is continuing within revolutionary organizations. The political and ideological level of the masses and their revolutionary vigilance have been raised to new heights. Capitalism and revisionism will never succeed in China."

Comrade Peçi said, "We saw the great strength and enthusiasm of the Red Guards in carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and their resolute determination to thoroughly smash the traitorous clique headed by China's Khrushchev."

Comrade Peçi emphasized that the Chinese people, the army, and revolutionary cadres have a special, boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and his Marxist-Leninist thought.

Comrade Peçi also cited numerous vivid examples to illustrate that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the 700 million Chinese people have achieved great successes in both revolution and production.

Comrade Peçi strongly denounced the slanders and defamations of the imperialists and revisionists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "Let the enemies howl. The People's Republic of China is advancing, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is marching towards comprehensive victory."

Comrade Peçi pointed out that the great People's Republic of China is not only a country with an advanced economy but also a military power. It is an impregnable fortress for safeguarding peace and revolution in the world. He enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army of China, saying that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the fires of war and armed with the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, is a reliable defender of the Chinese people and the revolution, a weapon of dictatorship in the hands of the Chinese people. It has iron discipline, is closely linked with the people, loves the people, and hates the enemy. He said, "The Chinese people love their army, which was born in the revolution, more than anything else. The U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Khrushchev revisionists, are trembling in the face of the unshakable strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

Comrade Peçi enthusiastically spoke about the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Albania. He said excitedly, "The meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao, among others, will be unforgettable to us."

Comrade Peçi's report was repeatedly interrupted by cheers of "Enver-Mao" and enthusiastic applause.

    佩奇同志说，我们亲自看到中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大胜利。它彻底粉碎了修正主义者和帝国主义者企图在中国复辟资本主义的梦想。现在中国到处在迅速建立革命委员会，革命组织内部正在继续深入进行斗私，批修。群众的政治思想水平和革命警惕性有了新的提高。资本主义和修正主义永远也不能在中国得逞。

    佩奇同志指出，伟大的人民中国不仅是一个具有先进经济的国家，而且是一个军事强国，是世界上保卫和平和革命的坚不可摧的堡垒。他热烈赞扬中国人民解放军说，经受战火锻炼和由毛泽东同志的思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，是中国人民和革命的可靠保卫者，是中国人民手中的专政的武器。她具有钢铁般的纪律，同人民血肉相连，热爱人民，痛恨敌人。他说，中国人民极其热爱在革命中诞生的自己的军队。美帝国主义者及其帮凶赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在中国人民解放军坚如磐石的力量面前怕得要命。
    佩奇同志热情地谈到了中阿两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结。他激动地说，同毛泽东主席以及林彪副主席等同志的会见，对我们来说将是难以忘怀的。
