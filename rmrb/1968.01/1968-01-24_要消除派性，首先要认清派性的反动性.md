	To eliminate factionalism, we must first recognize its reactionary nature. The factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is like a venomous snake; it can strangle and poison people. However, once people are entangled by it, they often do not realize it. If one falls into the quagmire of factionalism, one cannot recognize factionalism, let alone acknowledge one's own factionalism, and thus it is even more impossible to eliminate factionalism. Our experience in eliminating the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie at Beijing Dèngshìkǒu Girls' Middle School is that to eliminate factionalism, we must first recognize its reactionary nature. The process of recognizing the reactionary nature of factionalism is also the process of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism.

	The influence of the bourgeois reactionary line has divided the revolutionary teachers and staff of our school into two major factions. They have been attacking each other for a long time, seriously affecting the progress of the Cultural Revolution in the school and the work of resuming classes and making revolution. All revolutionary teachers and staff are very dissatisfied with this situation and are very anxious. However, some comrades have been bewitched by factionalism, mistakenly regarding the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie as proletarian revolutionary spirit, and regarding the struggle between small factions as the struggle between two lines. Each side thinks it is defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and each side says it cannot compromise or retreat, insisting on a winner-takes-all. Thus, the "civil war" escalates, the differences become greater, and factionalism becomes stronger. In this situation, many comrades cannot see the situation clearly and are pessimistic about the future of the school.

	At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great directive: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest directive dispelled the fog on the road ahead and made everyone's thoughts clearer. Many comrades began to think: What fundamental conflict of interests do we revolutionary teachers and staff have among ourselves? None. If there is none, what is it that is causing us to constantly fight "civil wars"? More and more people began to be alert to the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Immediately afterward, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and self-criticism," further pointing out the direction for us.

	In late October last year, with the help of the PLA, our school's revolutionary teachers and staff held the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, proposing to take criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism as the key to overcoming factionalism, eliminating differences, and truly achieving revolutionary great unity in thought. This study session achieved great results. However, everyone's understanding of the reactionary nature of factionalism was insufficient, and their hatred was not deep enough. Therefore, although everyone verbally agreed on the harm of factionalism, in the study class, they were looking at the factionalism of the other side with open eyes, criticizing the factionalism of the other side; when forced to do so, they used the pretext of examining their own factionalism to "cleverly" kick the other side and attack the other side, making the other side "speechless." In short, they only saw the shortcomings of others and not their own, painted others black, and saw themselves as shining everywhere. The New Year's editorial pointed out: "Whether one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." The editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism" also emphasized: "The factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie has played the role of a separate unit for a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Some of our comrades have the word 'self' in their minds, responding inside and outside, and hitting it off immediately." These two editorials sounded the alarm for us, and the countless facts of class struggle deeply educated us. More and more people began to realize that the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie had become a stumbling block hindering the victory of the Cultural Revolution in our school. With the enthusiastic and patient help of the PLA comrades, we held the second session of the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class in early January this year. Through the study, everyone further realized that proletarian revolutionaries must be loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, in order to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. The factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie interferes with the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and interferes with Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and must be fought in a "people's war" and decisively defeated. Everyone summed up the lessons of the first Mao Zedong Thought Study Class and decided to act according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "speaking less about the shortcomings and mistakes of others, and letting others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes." In this way, the study class presented a new situation of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism, overcoming factionalism.

	One comrade, in order to defeat the other side and achieve a complete victory in the "civil war," had kept a detailed record of what he thought were the other side's mistakes for more than a year. At the meeting, he held up the book and said: "This is the 'evil history' of my 'self,' and now I hand it over to the military training team as the beginning of my breakup with 'self.'" The entire venue immediately erupted, and everyone, with tears of excitement, shouted: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!

	Some revolutionary organizations, recognizing the harm of factionalism, decided to break with factionalism, stop all "civil wars," and unite against the enemy, also handing over the materials they had long kept, preparing to use them one day to "fight" the other side. Thus, in the song "The sky is big, the earth is big, but the party's favor is the biggest..." piles of "civil war" big-character posters, records prepared to settle accounts, and photo negatives prepared as evidence to attack the other side were all burned in public.

	This study session strongly promoted the thought revolutionization of all revolutionary teachers and staff in the school, greatly overcoming the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and achieving an unprecedented unity. The elimination of factionalism among teachers and staff strongly promoted the unity between teachers and students. A new type of relationship between teachers and teachers, and between teachers and students is forming in the school. The revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination of the entire school have been further consolidated.

    要消除派性，首先要认清派性的反动性
    北京灯市口女中革命委员会
    资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性象毒蛇一样，它会缠死人，毒死人。可是，人被它缠住了，往往还不自觉。如果陷进了派性的泥坑，就不能认识派性，不承认自己有派性，就更谈不到消除派性了。我们灯市口女中的革命教职员工克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的体会是，要消除派性，首先必须认识派性的反动性。认识派性反动性的过程，也就是斗私批修的过程。
    资产阶级反动路线的影响，把我校革命教职员工分成了两大派。长期互相攻击，严重地影响了学校文化大革命的进展和复课闹革命的工作。对这种情况，广大革命教职员工都非常不满意，心里很是焦急。但是，一些同志被派性迷住了心窍，把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性错误地当成无产阶级革命性，把小山头之间的斗争一律看成两条路线的斗争。互相都以为是在捍卫毛主席的革命路线，彼此都说坚持的是路线的斗争，你说不能妥协，他说不能退让，非要争个高下，分个胜负不可。这样，“内战”愈演愈烈，分歧越来越大，派性愈来越强。在这种情况下，不少同志看不清形势，对学校的前景感到失望。
    正在这个时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发出了
  “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大指示。毛主席这一最新指示，驱散了前进途中的迷雾，使大家思想开始亮堂了。许多同志都在想：我们革命的教职员工内部，有什么根本的利害冲突呢？没有。既然没有，是什么东西在中间作祟，使我们老是打“内战”呢？越来越多的人开始对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性警觉起来，紧接着，毛主席又发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，给我们进一步指明了方向。
    去年十月底，在解放军的帮助下，我校革命教职员工举办了第一期毛泽东思想学习班，提出了以斗私批修为纲，克服派性，消除分歧，从思想上真正实现革命大联合。这次学习，取得了很大成绩。但是，大家对派性的反动性认识不足，恨得不深，因此，虽然在口头上一致承认派性的危害，而在学习班上却是张着眼睛看对方的派性，批对方的派性；在不得已的情况下，以检查自己的派性为名，“巧妙”地踢对方一脚，攻击对方一顿，使对方“有苦难言”。总之，看的尽是别人的缺点，而不看自己的缺点，把别人说得漆黑一团，看自己到处闪光。元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”《论派性的反动性》的社论也着重指出：“资产阶级、小资产阶级派性起了党内一小撮走资派的别动队的作用。我们有的同志头脑里有‘私’字，里外呼应，一拍即合。”这两篇社论给我们敲起警钟，阶级斗争的无数事实也深刻地教育了我们。越来越多的人开始认识到资产阶级、小资产阶级派性已经成为阻碍我校文化大革命胜利前进的绊脚石。在解放军同志热情耐心的帮助下，我们在今年一月初第二次举办毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，大家进一步认识到，无产阶级革命派必须忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，才能紧跟毛主席的战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性干扰毛主席最新指示的落实，干扰毛主席的战略部署，必须进行一场“人民战争”，坚决打倒。大家总结了第一次办毛泽东思想学习班的教训，决心照毛主席“少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲”的教导办事。这样一来，学习班出现了斗私批修，克服派性的新局面。
    一个同志为了把对方压倒，取得“内战”的彻底胜利，一年多来，他把自己认为对方错误的东西做了一本详细的记录。会上他高举本子说：“这是我‘私’字的罪恶史，现在，我把它交给军训团，做为我和‘私’字决裂的开端。”全场立即轰动，大家含着激动的热泪高呼：毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    有的革命组织由于认识了派性的危害，决心和派性决裂，停止一切“内战”，一致对敌，也把长期保留准备有朝一日拿出来和对方“打仗”的材料交了出来。于是，在“天大地大不如党的恩情大……”的歌声中，成捆的“内战”大字报，一本本准备算账的记录，做为整对方的实据的照片底片，都统统当众焚烧了。
    这次学习，有力地促进了全校革命教职员工的思想革命化，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性大大克服了，出现了空前团结的局面。教职员工之间派性的消除，有力地促进了师生之间的团结。学校里教师与教师、教师和同学之间的新型关系正在形成，全校的革命大联合和三结合得到了进一步巩固。
