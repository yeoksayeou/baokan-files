Representatives of the Guangzhou Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, with hearts full of excitement, discussed the New Year's editorial in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily*: "Greeting the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be fully implemented

During the discussion, everyone reviewed the victories with hearts full of passion. Reflecting on a thousand thoughts and feelings, they all came down to one point: the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the great victory of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the new year, we must further ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented.

The representatives deeply understood that Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution summarize Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, and principles on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are the battle cry for guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve complete victory, and they are the beacon for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and ensuring our march towards a communist society. Therefore, comrades said: to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, we must first study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the discussion, the representatives used many vivid facts to illustrate that following Chairman Mao's latest instructions is following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and following Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Following is victory! The representative of the machine gun company of a certain unit, Company Commander Cao Zuosen, who is known as a "model for supporting the left," said: Their company was responsible for the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in a county, with long lines, wide areas, and far from leadership, and complex situations. However, they followed Chairman Mao's strategic deployment step by step and achieved continuous victories. When Chairman Mao instructed to correctly handle cadres, they deeply and widely propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy, liberating a large number of cadres; when Chairman Mao called for fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, they set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to fight selfishness and deeply carry out criticism. When reviewing the victories, Comrade Cao Zuosen excitedly said: Every victory of ours is the glorious victory of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The representative of the support-left group of a certain unit in a certain mine, Comrade Wang Xinru, felt that the closer one follows each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the clearer the direction, the faster the progress, and the greater the victory. Comrade Wang Xinru said: In March last year, we went to a certain mine to carry out support-left tasks. After seeing the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, which was personally approved by Chairman Mao to achieve revolutionary great unity by departments and systems, we immediately took action, actively propagated, and assisted the proletarian revolutionary factions in the mine to achieve revolutionary great unity, becoming the first unit in the locality to achieve revolutionary great unity.

The representatives unanimously agreed that 1968 is the year to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. To achieve complete victory, we must, with higher revolutionary consciousness, follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions fully implemented, and making Chairman Mao's latest instructions truly become the conscious revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

Promoting the Revolutionary Learning Style of Marxism-Leninism

Chairman Mao said: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of being proficient is entirely for application." During the discussion, the representatives, in connection with the struggle of the past year, talked about their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone thought that regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must use them after studying them, deeply understand them, and resolutely carry them out. One must check them regularly and summarize them in a timely manner. Using the "arrow" of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to hit the "target" of the current revolutionary practice is the key to ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented.

The entire army's active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Political Instructor Huang Zushi of a certain unit, recalled his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions over the past year, saying: Regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must follow them closely and use them fiercely. If one does not use them, one cannot talk about following them, let alone following them closely. In the year 1968, when we will seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the tasks of the People's Liberation Army are more arduous, more significant, and more glorious. For us, studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions have even greater significance.

During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that connecting theory with practice is the revolutionary learning style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao and the traditional style of our party. Regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, whether to use them after studying them or not to use them after studying them; whether to connect theory with practice or to separate theory from practice; this absolutely cannot be regarded as a problem of method or cognition, but a problem of class feelings and fundamental attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Huang Yurong, a militia member of the Jiling Commune in Jieyang County, Guangdong, as early as July 1966, soon after the start of the Cultural Revolution, used Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to expose the reactionary nature of the black *Cultivation of the Self*, and posted a big-character poster criticizing the black *Cultivation of the Self*. Her revolutionary rebellious actions angered the local clique of capitalist roaders within the party, and for several months, she was surrounded, attacked, and suffered all kinds of torments. At this critical moment, she remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," and finally overcame the "encirclement and suppression" of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. When she reviewed this struggle process, she said with great emotion: "Whether to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions or not is a matter of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. It is a touchstone for whether to be a thorough revolutionary or a revolutionary in name only. To use is to be for the public, to be revolutionary; not to use is to be for the private, to be un-revolutionary."

Everyone unanimously expressed that in the new year, regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must execute them 100%, carry them out 100%, and implement them 100%.

Overthrowing the Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism

During the discussion, everyone, in connection with the struggle practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, emphasized that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and make them fully implemented, one must "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," daring to resist and oppose interference from the right or ultra-left. The most fundamental thing to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is to firmly grasp the banner of "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism."

The representative of the support-left group in a certain factory in Guangzhou, Assistant Logistics Officer Wei Zhang of a certain unit, said: In the previous period, due to the "selfishness" in his mind, he did not follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity closely, taking a slow attitude. Later, after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles," he opened up his thoughts, fought selfishness, and went deep into the workers, actively propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly promoting the revolutionary great unity of the entire factory. From this, he realized that if there is "selfishness" in the mind, the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions will be discounted. Only by completely and thoroughly overthrowing the "selfishness" can one completely and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Sun Xiufu, the director of the People's Armed Forces Department in Feng County, Hunan Province, said: The process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a process of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, constantly transforming one's worldview. Once, the county's economic supervision group allocated a large sum of money to various revolutionary mass organizations. I felt that this was not in line with Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution." To criticize, it might cause their displeasure and ruin the relationship that had just been established. Turning it over in my mind, if I saw that the revolutionary factions had places that were not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and did not say it, did not stop it, this was selfishness, this was disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, I put forward my opinions, and the revolutionary faction comrades all agreed, immediately freezing the unspent funds.

The deputy section chief of the People's Armed Forces Department in Laibin County, Guangxi, Luo Changyuan, and Huang Zushi also said: To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one will encounter various obstacles from non-proletarian ideologies. Only by engaging in a head-on struggle with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, can one ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented.

The representatives present unanimously expressed that 1968 is the year to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the year when Mao Zedong Thought is popularized and deepened in a wider range, and the year when "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" achieves new victories in the depths of the soul. In the new year, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and everyone must be a model in studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的全面落实  就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表座谈纪要
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的部分代表，怀着无比兴奋的心情，座谈了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论：《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》。
    毛主席最新指示必须条条落实、全面落实
    在座谈中，大家回顾胜利，激情满怀。千思百感，集中到一点：无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，就是贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的伟大胜利。在新的一年里，我们一定要进一步保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。
    代表们深刻认识到：毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，概括了毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的一整套理论、路线、方针和政策，是指导无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的战斗号令，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟、保证我们走向共产主义社会的指路明灯。因此，同志们说：要活学活用毛泽东思想，首先就要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示。
    座谈中，代表们用大量的生动事实说明：紧跟毛主席的最新指示，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级司令部。紧跟就是胜利！被群众誉为“支左模范”的某部机枪连代表、连长曹祖森说：他们的连队担负了一个县的“三支”、“两军”任务，线长、面宽、远离领导，情况复杂。但是，他们步步紧跟毛主席的战略部署，就不断取得胜利。毛主席指示要正确地对待干部，他们就深入广泛地宣传毛主席的干部政策，解放了大批干部；毛主席号召要斗私，批修，他们便大办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助无产阶级革命派狠斗私字，深入开展大批判。在回顾胜利的时候，曹祖森同志激动地说：我们的每一个胜利，都是毛主席最新指示的光辉胜利。
    某部驻某矿支左小组的代表王新如同志的体会是：对毛主席的每一个最新指示，跟得越紧，方向就越明，前进就越快，胜利就越大。王新如同志说：去年三月份，我们到某矿执行支左任务。在看到毛主席亲自批发的贵阳棉纺厂按部门、按系统实现革命大联合的经验后，就立即行动，积极宣传，协助这个矿的无产阶级革命派胜利地实现了革命大联合，成为当地实现革命大联合最早的一个单位。
    代表们一致认为：一九六八年是从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年。要取得全面胜利，必须以更高的革命自觉，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，使毛主席的最新指示，真正变成亿万革命人民自觉的革命行动。
    发扬马克思列宁主义的革命学风
    毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”在座谈中，代表们联系一年来的斗争实际，畅谈了活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会。大家认为：对毛主席的最新指示，学了就要用，要深刻领会，坚决照办，经常检查，及时总结。用毛主席最新指示之“矢”射当前革命斗争实践之“的”，这是保证毛主席最新指示条条落实，全面落实的关键。
    全军学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部教导员黄祖示同志，回顾一年来活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会时说：对毛主席的最新指示，一是紧跟，二是狠用。不用，就谈不上跟，更谈不上跟得紧。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一九六八年，我们人民解放军担负的任务更艰巨、更重大、更光荣，对我们来说，学好用好毛主席的最新指示，更具有特别重大的意义。
    在座谈中，大家一致认为：理论联系实际，是毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，是我们党的传统作风。对待毛主席的最新指示，学了就用，还是学了不用；是理论结合实际，还是理论脱离实际；这绝不能看作是一个方法问题、认识问题，而是对待伟大领袖毛主席、对待毛泽东思想、对待毛主席革命路线的阶级感情问题和根本态度问题。广东揭阳县桂岭公社基干民兵黄育英同志，早在文化大革命开始不久的一九六六年七月，就用毛泽东思想这个强大思想武器，识破了黑《修养》的反动本质，贴出了批判黑《修养》的大字报。她的革命造反行动，惹怒了当地的党内一小撮走资派，几个月里，她被围攻，被打击，受尽了种种折磨。在这严重时刻，她牢记毛主席的教导，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命精神，终于战胜了资产阶级反动路线的“围剿”。当她回顾这段斗争历程时，满怀激情地说：“学习毛主席最新指示用不用，是对毛主席和毛泽东思想忠不忠的问题，是做完全革命派还是做口头革命派的试金石。用，就是为公，就是革命；不用，就是为私，就是不革命。”
    大家一致表示：在新的一年里，对毛主席的最新指示，一定要百分之百地执行，百分之百地照办，百分之百地落实。
    打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性
    在座谈中，大家联系一年来文化大革命的斗争实践，强调指出：要贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，做到条条落实，全面落实，就要“斗私，批修”，敢于抵制和反对来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰。全面落实毛主席最新指示，最根本的就是要狠狠抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲。
    在广州市某厂支左的某部后勤助理员韦璋同志谈到：前一时期，由于自己头脑里的“私”字作怪，对毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示跟得不紧，抱着慢慢来的态度。后来经过反复学习毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”，敞思想，斗私心，他深入到工人当中去，大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席的最新指示，迅速地促进了全厂的革命大联合。从这里，他体会到：头脑里有了“私”字，执行毛主席最新指示就打折扣。只有完全彻底地斗倒了“私”字，才能完全、彻底地执行毛主席的最新指示。
    湖南省凤凰县人民武装部部长孙秀福同志说：执行毛主席最新指示的过程，就是一个破私立公，不断改造世界观的过程。有一次，县里的经济监督小组拨了一大笔款，给各个革命群众组织。我感到这样做，不符合毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示。提出批评，又可能引起他们的反感，把刚刚建立起来的关系搞坏。转念一想，如果看到革命派有不符合毛泽东思想的地方，不说，不制止，这就是私，就是对毛主席的不忠。于是，我就提出了自己的意见，革命派同志都很赞成，立即将没有开支的款子冻结了。
    广西来宾县人民武装部副科长罗常源同志和黄祖示同志还说：要落实毛主席的最新指示，会遇到形形色色的非无产阶级思潮的阻力，只有同资产阶级、小资产阶级思想进行针锋相对的斗争，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，才能保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。
    到会代表们一致表示：一九六八年是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年，是毛泽东思想在更大范围内普及和深入的一年，也是“斗私，批修”，在灵魂深处爆发革命取得新胜利的一年。在新的一年中，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，人人做学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
