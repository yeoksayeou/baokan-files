	Always Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings and Make New Contributions to the People

	Representative of the Conference, member of the support-left team of the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, and active learner and user of Mao Zedong Thought from the General Staff Department, Fourth Session, Comrade Gu Yuanxing.

	January 26, 1968, what a happy and unforgettable moment! Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, with vigorous steps and a mighty hand guiding the world's revolutionary course, radiantly entered the reception hall.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, I, as a representative of the support-left team stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, have the honor of being personally received by you, feeling especially proud and infinitely happy. I cannot suppress the surging emotions in my heart, and I cannot wipe away the tears of happiness.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is your sunshine and rain that nurtured my growth. Your brilliant thoughts transformed me, a cowherd, into a brave fighter who took up arms to rebel against the local tyrants and bullies, following you on the revolutionary path. In the years of fierce anti-encirclement campaigns, on the famous Long March, during the arduous days of the War of Resistance, in the final battle to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek regime in the War of Liberation, and in the great era of socialist revolution and construction, it is your brilliant thoughts that gave me endless strength, forever inspiring me to move forward. Whenever I receive a combat mission, thinking of you, I am full of confidence and fighting spirit; whenever I encounter difficulties and setbacks, thinking of you, I am fearless and determined to move mountains and fill seas; whenever I face danger and hardship, thinking of you, I dare to brave the knife-edge mountain and fire sea; whenever I achieve some success, thinking of you, I remain humble and strive for greater victories!

	I will never forget that on September 8, 1944, I personally heard your great teachings in "In Memory of Comrade Zhang Zedong" where you called on all military and civilian personnel to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." For decades, this brilliant thought has been deeply engraved in my heart. During the support-left work at the Beijing Knitting Factory, we have taken this teaching as our fundamental guiding ideology, firmly believing in and relying on the majority of the people, wholeheartedly serving the majority.

	After entering the factory, we actively supported the broad leftist masses and did not support the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. We stood on the side of the proletariat and the people, vigorously promoting your great thoughts, using your latest directives as weapons, doing in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work. We helped the two revolutionary mass organizations, which were seriously opposed to each other, overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and gradually unite. For those who were misled, we treated them as class brothers, believing that they also wanted revolution. We, together with the proletarian revolutionaries, promptly delivered your brilliant thoughts to their hearts, making them quickly return to your revolutionary line. We believe that the majority of cadres are good. We, together with the proletarian revolutionaries, enthusiastically helped ninety percent of the cadres stand up, achieving the three-in-one combination for the revolution. We respectfully acted as students of the masses, widely soliciting opinions from the masses, humbly accepting criticism from the masses, and correcting errors decisively. We cared for the masses in various ways, visiting workers' families during holidays, helping them solve difficulties, and forming medical teams for mobile medical services. We studied, fought, labored, and criticized and transformed ourselves together with them, establishing a relationship of mutual dependence. All that we have done is the result of your repeated teachings, and every achievement we have made is a victory of your brilliant thoughts.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the great year of 1968, in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we swear to you: We will forever be loyal to you, to your great thoughts, and to your revolutionary line. We will follow your great strategic deployment, be humble, prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and together with all revolutionary workers and cadres in the factory, implement your series of latest directives comprehensively and thoroughly. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will make new contributions to the people.

    牢记毛主席教导为人民立新功
    大会代表、八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员
    总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表  古远兴
    一九六八年一月二十六日，这是多么幸福、多么难忘的时刻啊！我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，迈着刚健的步伐，挥动着指引世界革命航向的巨手，容光焕发地来到接见大厅。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！今天，我能作为驻北京针织总厂支左部队的代表，受到您老人家亲切接见，感到格外光荣和无限幸福。我抑制不住滚滚翻腾的心潮，我擦不干幸福的眼泪。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的阳光雨露滋润我成长。您的光辉思想，使我这个放牛娃，勇敢地拿起刀枪，造了土豪劣绅的反，跟随您老人家走上革命的征途。在战火连天的反围剿的年代里，在举世闻名的长征路上，在艰苦抗战的日子里，在最后摧毁蒋家王朝的解放战争中，在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大时代里，是您的光辉思想给了我无穷无尽的力量，永远鼓舞我前进。每当我接受一个战斗任务，想起您老人家，就信心百倍，斗志昂扬；每当我遇到困难和挫折，想起您老人家，就移山填海不怕难；每当我遇到危急和艰险，想起您老人家，就刀山火海也敢闯；每当我取得一点成绩，想起您老人家，就戒骄戒躁，去争取更大的胜利！
    我永生难忘的是，在一九四四年九月八日那一天，我亲自听到您老人家为悼念张思德同志而作的《为人民服务》的伟大教导。您号召全体军民要“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务。几十年来，您的这一光辉思想，时刻铭记在我的心间。在北京针织总厂支左的过程中，我们把您的这一教导作为根本的指导思想，坚决相信和依靠绝大多数群众，全心全意地为绝大多数人服务。
    我们进厂以后，积极支持左派广大群众，不支持资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。我们站在无产阶级和人民大众的立场上，大力宣传您的伟大思想，以您的最新指示为武器，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，帮助严重对立的两派革命群众组织克服派性，增强党性，逐步地联合起来。对于受蒙蔽的群众，我们把他们当作阶级兄弟，相信他们也是要革命的。我们同无产阶级革命派一起，及时把您的光辉思想送到他们的心坎上，使他们迅速回到您的革命路线上来。我们相信绝大多数干部是好的。我们同无产阶级革命派一起，热情地帮助百分之九十的干部站了出来，实现了革命的三结合。我们恭恭敬敬地做群众的小学生，广泛征求群众意见，虚心听取群众批评，有了错误坚决改正。我们多方关心群众生活，利用节假日走访职工家庭，帮助他们解决困难，还组成医疗组巡诊医疗。我们和他们一起学习，一起战斗，一起劳动，一起斗私批修，建立了鱼水相依的关系。我们所做的这一切，都是您老人家谆谆教导的结果，我们所取得的每一点成绩，都是您的光辉思想的胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在伟大的一九六八年，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中，我们向您老人家宣誓：我们永远忠于您，忠于您的伟大思想，忠于您的革命路线，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，谦虚、谨慎、戒骄、戒躁，同全厂革命职工和革命干部一起，条条落实、全面落实您的一系列的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中为人民立新功。
