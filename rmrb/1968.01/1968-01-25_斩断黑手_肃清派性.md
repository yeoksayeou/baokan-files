The editorial "Unite, Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat!" published by the Shanghai Three Newspapers Editorial Department and reprinted in the People's Daily has further stirred strong reactions among all revolutionary workers in our section. Reflecting on the intense class struggle that took place around us, we have come to see even more clearly the reactionary nature and harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Currently, a handful of class enemies are using the factionalism of certain people within the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat as a means to wage class struggle against the proletariat. We must heighten our vigilance and never fall for the class enemies' tricks!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions." Why have the two revolutionary mass organizations in our unit, "Revolutionary Rebels Association" and "Workers Revolutionary Association," not been able to unite for so long? Why have they been attacking each other and fighting "internal wars"? Apart from the mischief caused by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and the influence of anarchist thinking, it is because bad elements have infiltrated our ranks to sow discord.

Our original two revolutionary mass organizations, in the storm of the "January Revolution," jointly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. But the class enemies were not willing to accept their defeat. The counter-revolutionary criminal Huang Panlin, a member of the Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhen counter-revolutionary clique, had been sheltered by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, pretending to be sick at home and never showing his face. At this moment, he suddenly emerged, using the banners of "old revolutionary," "old rebel," and the so-called "General Headquarters of the Revolutionary Masses" to deceive the masses, infiltrate the revolutionary mass organizations, and seize leadership. He incited factionalism among certain people in our ranks, created divisions, and plotted to instigate one revolutionary mass organization to attack another. When one revolutionary mass organization raised questions about Huang, he would incite by saying, "Their attack on me is false; they mainly want to destroy your organization." After the "internal war" between the two revolutionary mass organizations was instigated by him, he said it was a struggle between two classes and two lines. Thus, the "internal war" became more intense. He, however, benefited from the chaos and fished in troubled waters.

Although the class enemies disguised themselves very cleverly and hid very well, they could not deceive the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the exposure of the broad revolutionary masses, this counter-revolutionary clique has now been exposed in broad daylight.

Recently, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the New Year's editorial, and the articles "Unite, Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat!" and "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism." They seriously engaged in self-criticism and the struggle against revisionism. Both sides, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "mutually speak less of each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak of their own shortcomings and errors, and each do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving small differences," made self-examinations and rooted out the factionalism that the black hands had instilled in them. At the same time, they held a mass meeting to criticize and denounce the crimes of the counter-revolutionary Huang Panlin. Through study and criticism, everyone further recognized the serious harm that factionalism brings to the proletarian revolutionary cause and vowed to overthrow factionalism and cut off the black hands. Thus, the two factions finally achieved revolutionary unity.

In the future, we will definitely study Chairman Mao's latest instructions more seriously, eliminate factionalism from our thoughts, heighten revolutionary vigilance, consolidate revolutionary unity, promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    斩断黑手　肃清派性
    上海铁路工人革命造反联合指挥部水电段工人革命联合造反队
    上海三报编辑部发表的《无产阶级革命派，联合起来！》一文，在《人民日报》上转载以后，进一步引起了我们全段革命职工的强烈反响。回顾发生在我们身旁的一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，我们更进一步看清了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动性和危害性。当前一小撮阶级敌人就是利用我们无产阶级革命派中某些人的派性，作为他们向无产阶级进行阶级斗争的一种手段。我们必须提高警惕，决不要上阶级敌人的当！
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们单位两个革命群众组织“革造会”和“工革会”，为什么过去长期联合不起来呢？为什么长期互相攻击，大打“内战”呢？除了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪和受了无政府主义思潮影响以外，就是因为有坏人混入到我们队伍中来挑拨离间。
    我们原来的两派革命群众组织，在“一月革命”风暴中，共同批判了资产阶级反动路线，造了党内一小撮走资派的反。但阶级敌人是决不甘心于他们的失败的。反革命分子黄盘林，这个李顺之、戚拯反革命集团的罪犯，在党内一小撮走资派的包庇下，长期装病在家，从不露面。这时突然冒了出来，打着“老革命”“老造反”和所谓“工总司常委”的招牌，蒙蔽群众，钻入革命群众组织，并篡夺了领导权。他极力煽动我们队伍中某些人的派性，制造分裂，阴谋挑动这个革命群众组织去攻打另一个革命群众组织。当一个革命群众组织对黄犯提出疑问时，他就挑拨地说：“他们攻我是假的，主要想把你们组织搞垮。”两大革命群众组织之间的“内战”被他挑起后，他还说，这是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。这样，“内战”越打越激烈。他却从中渔利，混水摸鱼。
    尽管阶级敌人装扮得很巧妙，很隐蔽，但是，他蒙蔽不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命派和革命群众。在广大革命派和革命群众的揭发下，这个反革命集团，现在已经暴露在光天化日之下。
    最近，在人民解放军的帮助下，两个革命群众组织的头头，学习了毛主席的最新指示、元旦社论和《无产阶级革命派，联合起来！》《论派性的反动性》等文章，认真地进行了斗私批修。双方按照毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示，各自都作了检查，挖出了黑手向自己灌输的派性。同时，又召开了批判和控诉反革命分子黄盘林罪行的群众大会。经过学习和批判，大家进一步认识到派性给无产阶级革命事业带来的严重危害，表示一定要打倒派性，斩断黑手。这样，两派终于在最近实现了革命大联合。
    今后，我们一定进一步认真学习毛主席的最新指示，从思想上肃清派性，提高革命警惕性，巩固革命大联合，促进革命三结合，条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
