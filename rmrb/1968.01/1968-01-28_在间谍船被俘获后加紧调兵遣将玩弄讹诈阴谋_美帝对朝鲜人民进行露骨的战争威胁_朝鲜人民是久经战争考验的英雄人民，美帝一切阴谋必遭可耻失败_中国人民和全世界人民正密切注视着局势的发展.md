	The U.S. imperialists, after their spy ship "Pueblo" was captured by the Korean People's Army naval vessels while conducting espionage activities in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on January 23, have been issuing frenzied war threats and deploying troops, engaging in blatant deception and conspiracies against the Korean people.

	From the beginning, U.S. imperialist leader Johnson has been personally plotting and directing this new evil conspiracy. After several days of frequent consultations with his high-ranking military and political subordinates, he delivered a television address on the 26th, distorting facts to slander the self-defense actions taken by the Korean people's armed forces in their own territorial waters as "seizure of a U.S. vessel in international waters," and declaring, "This is obviously unacceptable." He also blatantly threatened, "We have taken and are taking certain precautionary measures to ensure that our forces are prepared for any emergency in this area," and "I hope the North Koreans will recognize the seriousness of the situation they have created."

	Previously, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk had repeatedly stated that "North Korea should back down in this matter," and that "there is no other solution except the immediate release of the ship and its crew."

	Some politicians in Washington have even more frantically and blatantly called for "resorting to force," "starting another Korean War," and so on.

	Meanwhile, the Johnson administration has issued orders to deploy troops in quick succession. According to reports, immediately after the incident, the U.S. military authorities redirected a nuclear aircraft carrier, the "Enterprise," and three escort ships, originally destined for the waters off Vietnam, to the waters near Wonsan Harbor in North Korea. They also dispatched several ships from the U.S. Seventh Fleet to join them. On the 25th, Johnson ordered the mobilization of 14,000 "first-class reservists" and the activation of part of the Air Force and Navy reserves. Additionally, it is reported that the U.S. has dispatched a batch of aircraft from its air force units in Japan and Okinawa to South Korea. At the same time, U.S. troops and South Korean puppet forces in Korea have been ordered to be on "combat alert."

	The Korean people are a heroic people who have endured long-term war trials. Any war provocation and intimidation by U.S. imperialism will not frighten the Korean people. All the aggressive conspiracies of the U.S. will meet with a shameful failure. The Chinese people and people of the world are closely watching the development of the situation.

    新华社二十七日讯　美帝国主义在它的一艘间谍船“普韦布洛号”于一月二十三日侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海进行间谍活动时被朝鲜人民军海军舰艇俘获后，连日来发出了猖狂的战争叫嚣，调兵遣将，对朝鲜人民进行极其露骨的战争威胁。
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊从一开始就一直在亲自策划、指挥这一新的罪恶阴谋活动。他在接连几天频繁地同他手下的高级军政头目密谋策划之后，二十六日发表电视谈话，颠倒黑白地诬蔑朝鲜人民武装力量在自己领海内所采取的这一自卫行动是什么“在国际水域劫持”美国船只，并叫嚷：“这显然是不能接受的”。他还露骨地威胁说：“我们采取了并正在采取某些警戒措施，以保证我们的军队能对在这个地区出现的任何紧急状态作好准备”，“我希望北朝鲜人将认识他们造成的局面的严重性”。
    在这之前，美国国务卿腊斯克也曾一再发表谈话，公然威胁说：“北朝鲜最好在这方面后退”，“除了立即释放这条船和船上的官兵外”，不可能有其他解决办法等等。
    华盛顿的一些政客们甚至更加疯狂、露骨地叫嚣，要“诉诸武力”，“重新开始另一次朝鲜战争”，等等。
    与此同时，约翰逊政府接二连三下令调兵遣将。据报道，事件刚一发生，美国军事当局就把本来准备派往越南海面的一艘核航空母舰“企业号”和三艘护卫舰只调往朝鲜北部元山港附近的海面，同时还从美国第七舰队抽调了若干艘舰艇与之汇合；二十五日，约翰逊又下令征召“第一类预备役人员”一万四千多人服现役，同时征调空军和海军的一部分预备役部队服现役；此外，还有消息说，美国已经从驻日本和冲绳的空军部队中调派了一批飞机进驻南朝鲜。同时，侵朝美军和南朝鲜伪军也奉命处于“战斗戒备状态”。
    朝鲜人民是英雄的人民，是经受过长期战争考验的人民。美帝国主义的任何战争挑衅和恫吓，都是吓不倒朝鲜人民的。美帝的一切侵略阴谋，必将遭到可耻的失败。中国人民和全世界人民正在密切注视着局势的发展。
