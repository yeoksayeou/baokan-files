The Liberated Areas of South Vietnam Show New Prosperity
Late Rice Harvests Bring Bountiful Yields

Last year, the farmers in the liberated areas of the southern central region of South Vietnam bravely fought back against the "sweeping" operations of the U.S. puppet forces and achieved great victories. At the same time, they worked hard to produce a bumper late rice harvest. According to statistics, the average yield of late rice per hectare reached 2,200 kilograms, surpassing previous years. In some counties of Ninh Thuan and My Tho provinces, the yield per hectare reached 2,600 kilograms, with the highest reaching 9,000 kilograms.

The farmers in the liberated areas of the southern central region strengthened field management and pest control last year, and extensively used manure to replace chemical fertilizers. They also formulated measures to resist enemy attacks and protect production, thus ensuring a bumper harvest.

Fighting While Producing

The people of Binh Dinh Province, who are in the midst of fierce battles, have actively developed production and achieved significant results. In the first half of last year, the farmers in this province expanded the rice cultivation area to 155,180 hectares. To produce more food to support the war effort, they broke the habit of not planting double-crop crops and planted 15,000 hectares of double-crop crops.

Despite the continuous incursions of U.S. puppet forces into the liberated areas, the farmers bravely persisted in production. In the first half of last year, the enemy conducted more than 30 air raids and strafing attacks on Thuan Yen Commune in Le Thuy District and Phu Thuan Commune in Phu Yen District. The farmers not only tilled their original land but also planted nearly 1,430 hectares of double-crop crops. The enemy carried out brutal air raids on some communes in Phu Yen District. The farmers could not work during the day, so they went to the fields at night to ensure production.

Various handicraft industries in this province have also been restored and developed. Recently, more than 100 mills and basket weaving stations, 245 straw hat weaving stations, and 40 soy sauce and fish sauce processing stations have been established, producing a large number of daily necessities for the people.

A Mutual Aid Team in Battle

After the liberation of a certain commune in Quang Nam Province, more than 30 mutual aid teams were established. Among them, the first mutual aid team in the second village is an outstanding one. This team consists of 10 households who have formed a united and mutually supportive collective, developed production, supported the front line, and jointly resisted the enemy.

Originally, the team had two oxen, but one was killed by enemy bombs. To ensure timely cultivation, the team members used human labor to replace the oxen, successfully planting crops on time and achieving a bumper early rice harvest.

When someone in the team joined the army or worked as a civilian laborer, or was injured by enemy bombs, the mutual aid team would help these families with farming. When a grandmother's child joined the youth shock team to support the front line and her house was destroyed by the enemy, the mutual aid team helped her build a house and plant crops.

This mutual aid team not only has good unity and mutual support and excellent production but also does a good job in various services for the war effort. Whenever the commune or village needs civilian labor, they send it on time and in full. The war grain they contribute is always dried and clean, delivered to the collection point on time. They also sell a large amount of surplus grain to the National Liberation Front.

Capturing the Brave Battle on Film

The liberated South Vietnam Film Studio produced several newsreels in mid-November last year, which have already been shown to the audience. These include "The Great Victory at Xuyen Moc," "Children in the Liberated Areas," "A Letter Welcoming Uncle Ho," "Harvesting Rice," and "The Victory Rally." These films vividly reflect the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in their brave fight against the enemy, persistent production, and work. Some newsreels reflecting the achievements of the South Vietnamese military and people are filmed by the film studio's camera crew, who personally participated in the battles and shot them on the fiery battlefield.

A Cultural Study Class in a Commune

The people of Phu Ninh Commune in Ninh Thuan Province, while engaged in intense battles and production, also seized the time to study culture. Last year, the commune established 11 cultural study classes and 8 literacy classes, helping 68 people shed their illiteracy.

To study culture, the people of this commune overcame various material difficulties. Without classrooms, they built them themselves; without blackboards, they used wooden boards instead; without chalk, they found substitutes; without paper, they used banana leaves instead. They also used fragments of enemy bombs to make pen tips for writing.

    越南南方解放区新貌
    晚稻一片好收成
    去年，越南南方南部中区各省解放区的农民，在英勇反击美伪军的“扫荡”，并取得巨大胜利的同时，努力生产，又夺取了晚稻好收成。据统计，去年晚稻平均每公顷产量达二千二百公斤，超过往年的产量。新安和美萩省的一些县，每公顷产量达到二千六百公斤，最高的达到九千公斤。
    南部中区解放区的农民，去年加强了田间管理和防治水稻病虫害的工作，并且大量利用厩肥来代替化学肥料。同时，制定了抗击敌人、保卫生产的措施。这样就为夺取丰收提供了保证。
    边战斗边生产
    处在激烈战斗环境中的槟椥省人民，积极发展生产，取得了很大的成绩。去年上半年，这个省的农民把水稻种植面积扩大到十五万五千一百八十多公顷。为了生产更多的粮食支援抗战，他们还破除了不种双造作物的习惯，去年种了一万五千公顷双造作物。
    尽管美伪军不断侵犯解放区，但是农民们仍然英勇地坚持生产。去年上半年，敌人对左沥县兴庆乡和容宗县富山乡进行了三十多次轰炸、扫射，这两个乡的农民不但耕种了原有的土地，还种了近一千四百三十公顷的双造作物。敌人对盛富县的一些乡进行了残酷的轰炸，农民们白天不能干活，就在夜里下田，保证了生产。
    这个省的各种手工业，也得到恢复和发展，最近，成立了上百个磨坊和箩筐编织站，二百四十五个草帽编织站和四十个酱油、鱼露加工站，生产了大量人民生活必需品。
    一个战斗的互助组
    广南省某乡解放之后，就成立了三十多个互助组。其中，第二村第一互助组，是出色的互助组之一。这个组共有十户人家，他们结成了一个团结互助的集体，发展生产，支援前线，共同抗击敌人。
    组里原有两条耕牛，后来，一条被敌机炸死了，为了及时耕种，组员们就以人力来代替，结果不误农时地种上了庄稼，并且争得了早稻丰收。
    组里有人参军或出民工了，有人被敌机炸伤了，互助组就帮助这些人家耕作。一位大娘的孩子参加青年突击队支援前线，房子又被敌人炸毁了，互助组就帮助她盖了房子，种上了庄稼。
    这个互助组不但团结互助好，生产好，而且为抗战服务的各项工作也做得好。无论乡里村里什么时候要民工，他们都准时如数地派出。他们交纳的抗战公粮，总是打晒得又干又净，按时挑到交纳的地方，同时他们还把大量余粮卖给民族解放阵线。
    把英勇的战斗摄下来
    战斗的越南南方解放电影制片厂，在去年十一月中旬，制成了好几部新闻纪录片，并且已经陆续同观众见面。其中包括《西宁大捷》、《解放区的少年儿童》、《迎接胡伯伯的信》、《收割稻子》和《胜利者的大会》等。这些影片生动地反映了越南南方军民英勇杀敌、坚持生产和工作的英雄事迹。一些反映越南南方军民战绩的纪录片，是解放电影制片厂的摄影工作者，亲身参加战斗，在战火纷飞的战场上拍摄出来的。
    一个乡的文化学习班
    宁顺省福新乡的人民，在紧张战斗和生产的同时，抓紧时间学文化。去年，这个乡共办了十一个文化学习班和八个识字班，使六十八个人脱掉了文盲帽子。
    这个乡的人民为了学文化，克服了种种物质条件方面的困难。没有教室，他们就自己动手修建；没有黑板，他们就用木板代替；没有粉笔，他们就寻找代用品；没有纸，他们就用芭蕉叶代替。他们还利用敌人的炸弹片制成笔尖，用来写字。　　（据新华社）
