According to a report by the joint reporting group of the capital's news units, at the moment when our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left one year ago, the support-left personnel of the 834 Division stationed at the Beijing Textile Factory held a lively discussion on the great significance of Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, sharing their experiences in support-left work. They decided to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and better complete the glorious task of supporting the left. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in 1968, they will strive to achieve new merits for the people.

	The Historic and Significant Battle Command

The support-left personnel who participated in the discussion said with great excitement: Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left has great strategic significance for achieving victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. It also has far-reaching significance for strengthening the proletarian revolutionization of the army and enhancing its combat effectiveness. Chairman Mao's great call is the greatest concern, support, and encouragement for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country. It is also the greatest concern, trust, and encouragement for all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Comrade Wu Liandeng and other support-left personnel said: Last January, when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country entered a new stage and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat concentrated their forces to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the battle command and entrusted the glorious task of supporting the left to the People's Liberation Army. Over the past year, in this extremely fierce class struggle, the People's Liberation Army has been infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, most enthusiastically supported the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With boundless enthusiasm and wholeheartedly, they supported the broad masses of the left and fought together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, striking hard at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and greatly promoting the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, ensuring the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "grasping ideological and political education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles," has, in its support-left work, vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, conducted in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work. They actively helped the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their struggle, quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings in everything. At the same time, they actively spread the experience of political and ideological work, bringing the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eighth style, and promoting the three great democracies to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. In this way, supporting the left politically and ideologically is the greatest support for the broad masses of the left, fundamentally enhancing the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary mass organizations.

Comrade Ren Honglian and other support-left personnel said: Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left has accelerated the revolutionary construction of the army. Chairman Mao taught us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn." We deeply feel that participating in the grand mass movement enables us to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in struggle, criticize and transform our worldview. Our process of supporting the left is also a process of learning from the broad masses of the left. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loving of Chairman Mao, and the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to make revolution. For the sake of defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. The revolutionary masses are our teachers, and we are forever their students.

	Implementing the Three Principles of Support-Left Work to
	Effectively Complete the Support-Left Task

At the discussion meeting, everyone shared their experiences in doing a good job in support-left work. Everyone unanimously agreed that to do a good job in support-left work, one must implement the three principles of support-left work, which are: first, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and conduct in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work. Second, do not rush to take a stand, conduct investigations and research, and if both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually unite them. Third, learn from the worker masses, do not be afraid of making mistakes, and correct them if wrong. Care for the lives of the masses.

Comrade Chen Bingrong and other support-left personnel said: Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and quickly turning them into the conscious revolutionary actions of the broad revolutionary masses is the most fundamental task of support-left work and the most fundamental responsibility of support-left personnel. When we first entered the factory, there were many big-character posters of the two revolutionary mass organizations fighting "internal wars," and they even set up broadcasting stations to attack each other. We immediately helped the two revolutionary mass organizations to overcome factionalism with Mao Zedong Thought. We first organized the two revolutionary mass organizations to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on achieving great unity, and through patient and detailed ideological and political work, promoted the two revolutionary organizations to jointly set up a broadcasting station, turning the broadcasting station into a position for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we helped them set up a column for revolutionary criticism and guidance, leading the revolutionary masses to direct their spears at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, thoroughly criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in opposing Mao Zedong Thought. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the proletarian class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletarian class to split into two irreconcilable factions" was issued, we wrote big-character posters overnight and posted them throughout the factory. Using various opportunities such as large meetings, small meetings, and individual talks, we repeatedly propagated, making Chairman Mao's latest instruction deeply rooted in people's hearts. We also helped the two revolutionary mass organizations to carry out reminiscence and sweetness activities, better understand Chairman Mao's latest instruction. This quickly promoted the great unity of the two revolutionary mass organizations, making us deeply realize that no matter how much support, the best support is to support the left with Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhang Jin and other support-left personnel said: To grasp the root of arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, support-left personnel must first be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only in this way can one take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in insisting on the unshakable daily reading system, take the lead in holding good lectures on the application of Mao Zedong Thought, and take the lead in criticizing and transforming oneself. Only in this way can one, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, study, execute, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consciously put the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the first place in support-left work. Only in this way can one stand firmly and clearly, supporting whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and not supporting whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically helping to correct, truly supporting the broad masses of the left, and not supporting bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Comrade Zhao Ximei said: To complete the glorious task of supporting the left entrusted by Chairman Mao, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly believe in the masses, correctly treat the masses, and humbly learn from the masses. Before the two revolutionary mass organizations in the factory achieved great unity, the leadership assigned me to a workshop to help the two revolutionary mass organizations jointly organize a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. I thought, with such strong opposition between the two groups of masses, they wouldn't even speak to each other when they met on the road, how could they sing and perform together? I took a try-it-and-see attitude and forced myself to do ideological work. Who would have thought that after the workers studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, they realized that although there were still some differences in their views, propagating Mao Zedong Thought was a common task, and the general direction was the same. They quickly jointly organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and performed Mao Zedong Thought quotations songs on stage the third day. This incident deeply educated me. I further realized that Chairman Mao most believes in the broad revolutionary masses, the broad revolutionary masses most love Chairman Mao, most follow Chairman Mao, and most act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We can only firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit to do a good job in support-left work. Without the masses, we would achieve nothing.

	Fully Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions to
	Achieve a Comprehensive Victory in the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat

The support-left personnel who participated in the discussion expressed with revolutionary enthusiasm that in the new year, they must strive to complete the support-left task entrusted by Chairman Mao.

Comrade Xia Zhaohong and other support-left personnel said: Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a fundamental strategic measure to popularize Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must help the revolutionary masses to vigorously hold good study classes and strive to implement Chairman Mao's advocated revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice and often conducting self-criticism. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the ideological revolutionization of support-left personnel.

All the support-left personnel who participated in the discussion unanimously expressed: Our work is still far from meeting Chairman Mao's earnest expectations. In the new year, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has put forward new great strategic goals and five combat tasks for the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country. What is placed before us support-left personnel is a new test and tempering. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings of "being modest, prudent, guarding against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people," implement the three principles of support-left work, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

    八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员畅谈支左工作体会
    毛主席号召解放军支持左派广大群众是战略措施
    军民紧密团结夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利
    据新华社二十七日讯　首都新闻单位驻北京针织总厂联合记者组报道：在我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”伟大号召一周年的时刻，中国人民解放军八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无比忠诚的深厚阶级感情，热烈座谈毛主席号召人民解放军支持左派广大群众的伟大意义，畅谈支左工作的体会，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席最新指示为纲，更好地完成光荣的支左任务，在一九六八年夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
        具有伟大历史意义的战斗号令
    参加座谈的支左人员，以无比兴奋的心情说：伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，巩固无产阶级专政，具有重大的战略意义，对于加强军队的无产阶级革命化，提高战斗力，也有着深远的意义。毛主席的这一伟大号召，是对全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的最大关怀，最大支持，最大鼓舞，也是对人民解放军全体指战员的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞。
    支左人员吴连登等同志说：去年一月，在我国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新阶段，无产阶级革命派集中力量，向党内一小撮走资派展开猛烈进攻的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席发出战斗号召，把支左的光荣任务，交给了人民解放军。一年来，在这场极其激烈的阶级大搏斗中，人民解放军无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，最热烈地拥护伟大统帅毛主席，在“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”伟大号召的指引下，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，满腔热情地、全心全意地支持左派广大群众，和无产阶级革命派团结战斗在一起，狠狠地打击了党内一小撮走资派，极大地推动了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，保证了无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性的胜利。
    人民解放军遵循毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在支左工作中，大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，积极帮助无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，处处按毛主席的教导办事。同时，大力传播政治思想工作的经验，把人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主等优良传统，带给了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众。这样从政治上思想上支持左派，是对左派广大群众最大的支援，从根本上提高了革命群众组织的战斗力。
    支左人员任洪连等同志说：伟大领袖毛主席号召人民解放军支持左派广大群众，让部队到火热的群众运动中去经风雨，见世面，接受考验，进行锻炼，大大加速了部队的革命化建设。毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们深深体会到，参加规模宏伟的群众运动，能使我们更好地在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，改造世界观。我们支持左派的过程，也是向左派广大群众学习的过程。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，最忠于毛主席，最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。他们敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。革命群众是我们的老师，我们永远是他们的小学生。
        贯彻执行支左工作三项原则，才能
    很好地完成支左任务
    在座谈会上，大家畅谈了搞好支左工作的体会。大家一致认为，要搞好支左工作，一定要贯彻执行支左工作的三项原则，这就是：一、大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作。二、不匆匆忙忙急于表态，经过调查研究，如果两派都是革命的群众组织，就逐步地把他们联合起来。三、向工人群众学习，不怕犯错误，错了就改。关心群众的生活。
    支左人员陈秉荣等同志说：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，全面落实毛主席最新指示，使之迅速变为广大革命群众自觉的革命行动，这是支左工作最根本的任务，是支左人员最根本的职责。我们刚进厂的时候，两派革命群众组织打“内战”的大标语很多，并且各自设立广播站互相攻击。我们立即帮助两派革命群众，用毛泽东思想克服派性。我们首先组织两派革命群众，认真学习毛主席关于实现革命大联合的教导，通过耐心细致的思想政治工作，促使两派革命组织联合举办广播站，把广播站变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。同时，帮助他们办起革命大批判专栏，引导革命群众把矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资派，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席这一最新指示发表以后，我们连夜写成大字报，张贴全厂，利用大会、小会、个别谈话等各种机会，反复宣传，使毛主席这一最新指示深入人心。我们还帮助两派革命群众，通过开展忆苦思甜活动，更好地领会毛主席的最新指示。很快促进了两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，这使我们深刻认识到，千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想支援左派，是最大的支援，最好的支援。
    支左人员张锦等同志说：要抓好用毛泽东思想武装群众这个根本，支左人员自己首先要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有这样，才能带头活学活用毛泽东思想，带头坚持雷打不动的天天读制度，带头开好讲用会，带头斗私；只有这样，才能以最大的热情、最快的速度，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示，自觉地把落实毛主席最新指示放在支左工作的首位；只有这样，才能够做到立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，凡是符合毛泽东思想的就支持，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的就不支持，并且热情地帮助改正，真正做到支持左派广大群众，而不支持资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    支左人员赵喜梅同志说：要完成毛主席交给的光荣的支左任务，必须遵照毛主席的教导，坚定地相信群众，正确地对待群众，虚心地学习群众。在厂里两派革命群众组织实现革命大联合之前，领导上让我到一个车间帮助两派革命群众共同组织一支毛泽东思想宣传队。我想，两派群众对立情绪那么大，走路碰面都扭头不说话，怎么能在一起唱歌、排节目？我抱着试试看的态度，硬着头皮去做思想工作。谁知，工人们经过学习毛主席的有关指示，认清了双方尽管观点还有某些不同，但是宣传毛泽东思想是共同的任务，大方向是一致的，很快就联合组织了一支毛泽东思想宣传队，第三天就上台大唱毛主席语录歌。这件事使我深受教育。我进一步认识到，毛主席最相信广大革命群众，广大革命群众最热爱毛主席，最紧跟毛主席，最能按毛主席的指示办事，我们只有坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，才能做好支左工作。离开了群众，我们就一事无成。
      全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产
    阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    参加座谈的支左人员，满怀革命豪情地表示，在新的一年里，一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉地去完成毛主席交给的支左任务。
    支左人员夏兆鸿等同志说：办毛泽东思想学习班，是普及毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示的一项根本性的战略措施，我们一定要帮助革命群众大力办好，努力贯彻毛主席倡导的理论联系实际、多作自我批评等革命学风。我们要努力活学活用毛主席著作，加强支左人员的思想革命化。
    参加座谈的全体支左人员一致表示：我们的工作，距离毛主席的殷切期望还相差很远。在新的一年里，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，又向全党、全军和全国人民提出了新的伟大战略目标和五项战斗任务。摆在我们支左人员面前的是一场新的锻炼和考验。我们一定要牢记毛主席的“应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的亲切教导，贯彻执行支左工作的三项原则，和广大革命群众一起，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
