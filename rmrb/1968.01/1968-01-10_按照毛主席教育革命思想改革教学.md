The editorial board notes: Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution are a great blueprint for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Forestry College have carried out the revolution according to Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution, abolished the research offices, established professional brigades, reformed teaching, and continuously advanced on the road of the proletarian educational revolution.

Currently, primary, secondary, and tertiary schools across the country are studying Chairman Mao's directives on the educational revolution. We hope that revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers will study and practice while implementing Chairman Mao's directives, ensuring that every directive is fully implemented. We must carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at Beijing Forestry College have resolutely implemented and earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's thoughts on the proletarian educational revolution. On one hand, they have strengthened the political and ideological foundations of the professional brigades. On the other hand, in teaching, they have used Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution as their guide, taken class struggle as the key link, and production struggle as the main line. They have implemented a "one-line" teaching method that combines revolutionary students, teachers, and workers, basic courses and specialized courses with practice, and classroom teaching with production teaching.

Trust the Masses, Rely on the Masses

After Beijing Forestry College resumed classes and carried out the revolution, the first problem they encountered was: how to conduct classes? Initially, some classes, though slightly improved in teaching methods compared to before, were still largely "injection-style" and "full-class pouring." Different subjects did not communicate with each other, leading to redundant content and a disconnect from reality. There were two different opinions among the students. Some thought, "This way is systematic and we can learn more knowledge." The majority of students disagreed, saying, "This way of teaching has too many courses, the theory is detached from reality, and what we learn is not useful. We must thoroughly reform it."

How to carry out the reform? Everyone was at a loss. Thus, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff studied Chairman Mao's works, held extensive discussions and debates. In his essay "Oppose Book Worship," Chairman Mao pointed out, "If you cannot solve a problem, then go investigate the current state and history of that problem. Once you fully understand it, you will have a solution." They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, organized a small number of teachers and students to visit nearby factories and forest farms, listen to the opinions of workers, and then brought the workers' opinions back to the school. They mobilized the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to analyze and study them. Many classes also invited revolutionary workers and technicians from the factories to the school to participate in discussions and debates.

Through these debates, they clarified three issues: First, education must adhere to the direction of serving proletarian politics. The old educational system, content, and methods served the bourgeoisie and must be abolished. Second, teaching should be concise and precise. Various knowledge points are interrelated, but the old teaching methods isolated each subject, leading to redundant courses and content. Unnecessary courses and content must be cut. Third, to make teaching concise and precise, it must be targeted. The main flaw of the old teaching methods was the severe disconnect from reality and the educational objects. The new teaching methods must closely combine theory with practice and education with productive labor.

After studying and debating, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff actively participated in the battle to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational system and establish a new educational system. The revolutionary youngsters of the forestry brigade, based on teaching practice, first boldly proposed: taking class struggle as the key link, production struggle as the main line, integrating basic and specialized courses into a "one-line" curriculum, and combining revolutionary students, teachers, and workers. Their revolutionary actions were supported by the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff across the school. The revolutionary teachers and students of the woodworking brigade immediately took action, sending people to factories for investigations and teaching practices. Many grades successively formed preparatory groups consisting of revolutionary students, teachers, and workers to specifically guide and study the "one-line" teaching method. Under the guidance of the preparatory groups, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff taught, reformed, and summarized while teaching, continuously improving and perfecting the "one-line" teaching method.

Political Leadership, Both Red and Expert

Chairman Mao taught us, "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." The "one-line" teaching method, from beginning to end, takes Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution as the highest guideline, using politics to lead and guide teaching, cultivating students to develop in moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, becoming socially conscious laborers with culture. The entire teaching process includes three educational contents: class education, labor education, and specialized education.

Class struggle is a core course. The "one-line" teaching method starts with class struggle education. Their method is "invite in and go out," inviting revolutionary old workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to the school to teach class struggle courses, moving the classroom to the factory, and inviting revolutionary workers to teach. For every class, revolutionary workers first teach class struggle history, and then teach specialized knowledge. For example, in the first class of the woodworking sixth-year second class at the Beijing Wood Materials Factory, the worker comrades first taught them the history of the two-line struggle in the production of fiberboard in our country, and then introduced the production of fiberboard. This way of teaching received positive feedback from the students, who said, "Every class is both a class struggle course and a production struggle course, it's great!"

The "one-line" teaching method also lists labor courses as a compulsory subject, in addition to organizing revolutionary teachers and students to participate in a certain amount of productive labor in people's communes, forest farms, and factories, they also participate in productive labor in specialized education, learning from revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants through labor, changing their thoughts, and walking the path of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants.

The "one-line" teaching method changed the old teaching methods that were severely detached from reality and production, closely combining teaching with production. It forms a "one-line" curriculum based on the characteristics of each specialty and the production process. For example, the forestry specialty forms a "one-line" curriculum for the entire forestry production process in teaching, and the woodworking machinery specialty forms a "one-line" curriculum for the entire woodworking machinery process in teaching. This way, education faces production, combining education with production, learning for use, and applying what is learned.

Mutual Teaching and Learning, Combining Learning with Doing

Revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Forestry College, based on the principle of "mutual teaching and learning, combining learning with doing," adopted many new teaching forms in teaching, making students the main focus while also learning industry, agriculture, and combining theory with practice.

Revolutionary students, teachers, and workers combine and mutually teach and learn. Not only are the preparatory groups composed of revolutionary students, teachers, and workers (including revolutionary workers and technicians from external production units), but the entire teaching process is also completed by these three groups. They complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, mutually teach and learn, and jointly improve.

The "one-line" teaching method combines classroom teaching with production teaching, applying the principle of "practice-knowledge-practice-knowledge" throughout the entire teaching process. They mainly use production practice teaching, supplemented by self-study and classroom discussions. For every class, they first propose a teaching outline or plan based on practice, then go to the production unit for teaching, and then return to the classroom for discussion, analysis, and improvement, elevating sensory knowledge to rational knowledge; then return to actual production for verification and summarization, and simultaneously prepare the teaching outline or lesson plan for the next class. This way, they repeatedly practice and repeatedly recognize, improving step by step. In this process, the "three-in-one" preparatory group gradually takes responsibility for compiling new teaching materials.

The "one-line" teaching method also combines basic courses and specialized courses with practice. For example, forestry students start practicing forestry production technology as soon as they enroll, and then integrate the necessary theoretical parts, making students not only master production skills but also elevate to rational knowledge. Students say, "This way of learning is lively, easy to remember, improves quickly, and is useful!"

Shorten the School System, Reform Education

After two to three months of preliminary teaching practice, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at Beijing Forestry College have seen many advantages of the "one-line" teaching method. Its main advantages are:

First, it is conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's correct policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." The "one-line" teaching method emphasizes proletarian politics everywhere, using politics to lead professional work. It closely combines book knowledge with actual production knowledge. Every teaching link is closely centered around production, making revolutionary teachers and students constantly engage in the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, constantly engage with the worker and peasant masses, and maintain close contact with them.

Second, it is conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "shorten the school system and revolutionize education." The old teaching methods had long school systems, many courses, and tedious, repetitive content. After implementing the "one-line" teaching method, irrelevant courses and content were removed, making it concise and precise, saving teaching resources, and shortening the school system. They felt through preliminary teaching practice that implementing the "one-line" teaching method can cut 60% from the original teaching materials. For example, the course "Wood Material Thermal Treatment" originally required 80 class hours, but now 10 class hours are sufficient.

Third, it is conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's great thought of "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and soldiers teach soldiers." The "one-line" teaching method adheres to the mass line and democratic teaching methods, with revolutionary students, teachers, and workers jointly formulating teaching plans, outlines, content, methods, and styles, jointly taking the stage to teach, mutually teach and learn. Revolutionary workers with rich practical experience play an active role in the educational revolution, revolutionary students exert their strengths and subjective initiative, actively and lively learn, and revolutionary teachers go to the teaching classes, eat, study, and labor with the students, jointly carry out the revolution, promote ideological transformation, and improve teaching abilities.

Fourth, it is conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's directive, personally formulated in the "Sixteen Points," about "in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools." Previously, they ended the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the school through the abolition of research offices and the establishment of professional brigades. Now, implementing the "one-line" teaching method further breaks the monopoly of bourgeois intellectuals over education and theory. The old teaching methods made theory detached from reality, mystical, and monopolized by a few bourgeois intellectuals; the "one-line" teaching method makes theory connected with reality, popularized, and grasped by the masses. Revolutionary students, teachers, and workers become the masters of culture and the main force of the educational revolution.

    按照毛主席教育革命思想改革教学
    编者按：毛主席的教育革命思想，是进行无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领。北京林学院的革命师生，按照毛主席的教育革命思想闹革命，取消教研室，建立专业连队，改革教学，在无产阶级教育革命的道路上，不断前进。
    现在，全国大、中、小学校都在学习毛主席关于教育革命的指示。我们希望，广大革命学生、革命教员、革命工人，边学习，边实践，使毛主席的指示条条落实，全面落实，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    北京林学院革命师生员工，对毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想，坚决照办，认真落实。他们一方面从政治上、思想上巩固专业连队的组织，另一方面在教学中，以毛主席教育革命思想为指针，以阶级斗争为纲，以生产斗争为主线，实行革命的学生、教员与革命的工人相结合，基础课和专业课与实际相结合，课堂教学与生产教学相结合的“一条龙”的教学方法。
    相信群众，依靠群众
    北京林学院复课闹革命后，碰到的第一个问题是：课如何上？开始，有的课虽然在教学方法上比以前有些改进，基本上仍然是“注入式”，“满堂灌”，各门功课互不通气，互不对口，内容重复，脱离实际。这样教，同学中有两种不同的看法，有的认为：“这样有系统性，可多学点知识。”大多数同学不同意这种看法，他们说：“这样教，课程繁多，理论脱离实际，学非所用，必须彻底改革。”
    到底如何进行改革，大家心中无数。于是，革命师生员工学习毛主席著作，进行广泛的座谈、辩论。毛主席在《反对本本主义》一文中指出：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，有计划、有领导、有目的地组织少数师生，到附近的工厂和林场调查访问，听取工人的意见。然后，把工人的意见带回学校，发动广大的革命师生员工分析研究。许多班级还把工厂的革命工人和技术员请到学校里来，参加讨论会和辩论会。
    他们通过辩论，明白了三个问题：一、教育必须坚持为无产阶级政治服务的方向。旧的教育制度、内容和方法是为资产阶级服务的，必须把它破除。二、教学要少而精。各种知识是有机联系的，而旧的教学却把各学科孤立起来，互不通气，以致课程繁多，内容重复，必须把不必要的课程、内容砍掉。三、要使教学少而精，必须有针对性。旧教学的主要缺点，就是严重地脱离实际和教育的对象。新的教学必须使理论和实际紧密相结合，教育和生产劳动紧密相结合。
    广大革命师生员工经过学习和辩论，积极投身到批判反革命修正主义教育制度、创立新的教育制度的战斗中。林业专业连队的革命小将根据教学的实践，首先大胆提出：以阶级斗争为纲，以生产斗争为主线，专业课和基础课配套成龙，革命的学生、革命的教员和革命的工人三结合，贯彻实行“一条龙”的教学。他们的革命行动得到了全校广大革命师生员工的支持。木工专业连队的革命师生立即行动起来，派人下厂调查研究，进行教学实践。许多年级先后组成有革命的学生、革命的教员和革命的工人参加的备课小组，具体指导并研究“一条龙”的教学。广大革命师生员工在备课小组的指导下，边教学，边改革，边总结，使“一条龙”教学不断得到提高、完善。
    政治挂帅，又红又专
    毛主席教导我们：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”“一条龙”教学自始至终以毛主席的教育革命思想为最高纲领，以政治统帅教学，指导教学，培养学生成为在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。整个教学过程包括三个教育内容：阶级教育，劳动教育，专业教育。
    阶级斗争是一门主课。“一条龙”教学就是从阶级斗争教育入手来开展教学的。他们的办法是“请进来，走出去”，请革命的老工人和贫农下中农到学校讲阶级斗争课，把课堂搬到工厂，请革命工人讲课。每一堂课，革命工人首先给他们讲阶级斗争史，然后讲专业知识。例如木工专业六三年级二班到北京木材厂上纤维板的第一堂课，工人同志首先给他们讲我国制造纤维板两条路线的斗争历史，然后介绍纤维板的生产。这样讲课，同学们反映很好，他们说：“每一堂课既是阶级斗争课，又是生产斗争课，好得很！”
    “一条龙”教学把劳动课也列为一门必修课，除组织革命师生参加人民公社、林场、工厂的一定的生产劳动之外，在专业教育中也要参加生产劳动，通过劳动向革命工人和贫农下中农学习，改造思想，走知识分子与工农相结合的道路。
    “一条龙”教学改变了旧教学严重脱离实际、脱离生产的现象，把教学和生产紧紧相结合。它根据各个专业的特点和生产的过程组成一条龙，比如林业专业把整个林业生产过程在教学中形成一条龙，木材机械加工专业把整个木材机械加工过程在教学中形成一条龙。这样使教育面向生产，教育与生产相结合，学用结合，学以致用。
    互教互学，学用结合
    北京林学院的革命师生，本着“互教互学，学用结合”的原则，在教学中采取许多新的教学形式，使学生以学为主，也兼学工，学农，使理论联系实际。
    革命的学生、革命的教员与革命的工人相结合，互教互学。不但备课小组是由革命的学生、革命的教员和革命的工人（包括院外生产单位的革命工人和技术员）组成的，而且它的整个教学过程都是由这三方面的人员一起来完成的。他们在教学中取长补短，互教互学，共同提高。
    “一条龙”教学把课堂教学与生产教学相结合，把“实践——认识——再实践——再认识”的原理应用于整个教学过程中。他们以生产实践教学为主，辅以自学和课堂讨论。每一节课，先由实践中提出教学提纲或方案，然后到生产单位进行教学，再到课堂进行讨论、分析、提高，把感性知识提升为理性知识；然后又回到实际生产中进行检验总结，并同时准备下一节课的教学提纲或教案。这样，反复实践，反复认识，一次比一次更加完善。在这个过程中，“三结合”备课小组也就逐渐负责编出新的教材来。
    “一条龙”教学还把基础课和专业课与实际结合起来。例如林业专业的学生一入学就开始进行造林生产技术的操作，然后再把所需要的理论部分配合进去加以阐述，使学生不但掌握了生产技能，同时也提高到理性认识。同学说：“这样学得活，记得牢，提高快，用得上！” 
    缩短学制，改革教育
    经过两三个月来的教学的初步实践，北京林学院广大革命师生员工已经看到“一条龙”教学的许多优越性。它的主要好处是：
    一、有利于贯彻执行毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的正确方针。“一条龙”教学处处突出无产阶级政治，以政治统帅业务。它把书本知识和实际生产的知识紧密结合起来，它的每一教学环节都紧紧围绕着生产进行，使革命师生经常接触阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命，经常接触工农群众，和他们保持紧密的联系。
    二、有利于贯彻执行毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的伟大指示。旧教学学制长，课程多，内容烦琐、重复。实行“一条龙”教学后，不切实际的课程、内容被删去了，因而可以少而精，节省师资，缩短学制。他们经过初步的教学实践，感到实行“一条龙”教学可以从原教材中砍掉百分之六十，比如《木材水热处理》这门课程原需要八十个课时，现在有十个课时就够了。
    三、有利于贯彻执行毛主席“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的伟大思想。“一条龙”教学坚持走群众路线，坚持民主教学的方法，革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人共同拟定教学计划、教学大纲、教学内容、教学方式和方法，共同登台讲课，互教互学。富有实践经验的革命的工人发挥他们在教育革命中的积极作用，革命的学生发挥自己的专长和主观能动性，生动活泼主动地学习，革命的教员下到教学班，与同学同吃，同学习，同劳动，共同闹革命，促进思想革命化，提高授课能力。
    四、有利于贯彻执行毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”关于“在这场文化大革命中，必须彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”的指示。前一段，他们通过取消教研室、建立专业连队，从组织上结束了资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治，现在实行“一条龙”教学，进一步打破资产阶级知识分子垄断教育和理论的局面。旧教学使理论脱离实际，神秘化，变为少数资产阶级知识分子所垄断；“一条龙”教学使理论联系实际，通俗化，为群众所掌握，革命的学生、革命的教员和革命的工人成为文化的主人，成为教育革命的主力军。
