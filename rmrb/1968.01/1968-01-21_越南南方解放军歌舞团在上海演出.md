The heroic Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe of South Vietnam, carrying the fighting camaraderie of the people of South Vietnam, held their first performance in Shanghai on the evening of the 19th.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, responsible officials of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, Li Shiyang, Gao Zhirong, Wang Chenglong, and relevant officials, as well as workers from factories, revolutionary artists, and Red Guards, attended the performance.

As the curtain slowly opened, the backdrop displayed the flags of China and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, symbolizing the strong fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the people of South Vietnam. The performance began with the majestic songs "Liberate the South" and "The East Is Red." The South Vietnamese artists passionately sang songs praising the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, such as "The Voice of Uncle Ho." They also sang and played songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao, such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and the song based on Chairman Mao's quotations "The Core Force Leading Our Cause Is the Communist Party of China." They also performed many songs and dances reflecting the South Vietnamese military and civilians' victories over the U.S. aggressors. The performance was warmly received by the audience.

At the end of the performance, Li Shiyang, Gao Zhirong, Wang Chenglong, and others went on stage to congratulate the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe on their successful performance. They also presented portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh to the troupe.
