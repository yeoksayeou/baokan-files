Japanese people resolutely oppose the docking of U.S. nuclear warships
Massive anti-U.S. demonstrations held, clashes with reactionary police
The Revisions led by Namba act as henchmen for the Sato government, obstructing the anti-U.S. struggle

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the East China News Agency reported: On the 21st, patriotic workers and students in Sasebo launched a massive patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism, continuing to resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" entering Sasebo. This struggle has made the U.S. imperialists and the reactionary Sato government tremble with fear.

The Sato government, early in the morning, mobilized a large number of police and armored vehicles to block the road leading to the U.S. military base in Sasebo. In the afternoon, 1,500 patriotic students, despite the obstruction and suppression by the reactionary government, held a protest rally and then rushed to the U.S. military base to demonstrate. They engaged in fierce struggles with the police. The reactionary police sprayed them with poisonous water, threw tear gas, and beat them with batons, injuring many and arresting eleven. However, the students continued to bravely fight on. They retaliated with sticks and seized two armored vehicles used by the police. One hundred students rushed to the outskirts of the military base. Two students jumped over the barbed wire and entered the base, where they were arrested by the reactionary police.

Fifteen thousand workers strongly supported the brave struggle of the patriotic students. They marched towards the U.S. military base with the students. Some revolutionary masses from Fukuoka also came to participate in this struggle. More than twenty thousand citizens nearby were extremely angry at the reactionary Sato government's atrocities of directing the police to suppress the people's patriotic anti-U.S. struggle. They supported the actions of the workers and students and threw stones fiercely at the reactionary police. By 5 PM, the patriotic workers, students, and citizens were still on the bridge leading to the military base, angrily protesting against the reactionary police. The struggle lasted six hours and ended at 7 PM in the evening.

Under the strong protests of the Japanese people, the U.S. military authorities had to order the sailors of the "Enterprise" not to go ashore.

The Namba revisionist group once again helped the Japanese reactionary government suppress the people's patriotic anti-U.S. struggle. With the approval of the reactionary police, the members of this traitorous group used violence to prevent patriotic students from participating in the protest rally. They also demanded that the police use violence to suppress the students. Their despicable behavior was strongly condemned by the broad masses of citizens present.

Three thousand patriotic workers and students from Kanagawa Prefecture, Tokyo, and the Kanto and Tohoku regions held a protest rally at the U.S. Seventh Fleet base in Yokosuka on the 21st.

After the meeting, all the participants, holding red flags and with high morale, held a demonstration march.

About 7,000 workers, students, women, and businesspeople in Tokyo held a rally in Hibiya Park on the 20th, strongly opposing the docking of the "Enterprise" and condemning the Sato reactionary government's suppression of patriotic students.

The headbands of the participants read: "U.S. imperialism out of Japan!" "Down with the Sato government!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" The venue was filled with red flags, including flags with "Long live Mao Zedong Thought" and flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The venue was filled with the atmosphere of the Japanese people uniting and fighting with the Chinese and Vietnamese people. After the meeting, a demonstration march was held.

    日本人民坚决反对美国核军舰停泊
    举行大规模反美示威，同反动警察激烈搏斗
    宫本修正主义集团竟然充当佐藤政府帮凶阻挠反美斗争
    据新华社二十一日讯  据东方通讯社报道：日本爱国工人和学生二十一日在佐世保掀起大规模的反美爱国斗争，继续坚决反对美帝国主义的核航空母舰“企业号”闯入佐世保。这场斗争吓得美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府胆战心惊。
    佐藤政府一清早就调集大批警察和装甲车，封锁了通往佐世保美军基地的那条道路。下午，爱国学生一千五百人不顾反动政府的阻挠和镇压，在举行了抗议集会以后，涌向美军基地举行示威。他们和警察展开了激烈的搏斗。反动警察向他们喷射毒水，放毒气弹，用警棍殴打他们，打伤多人，逮捕十一人。但是，学生们继续英勇地坚持斗争。他们用棍棒进行还击，并且夺取了警察使用的两辆装甲车。一百名学生冲到美军基地周围。有两名学生越过铁丝网冲进了基地，被反动警察逮捕。
    一万五千名工人大力支持爱国学生的英勇斗争。他们和学生一起向美军基地进军。福冈市的一些革命群众也赶来参加了这次斗争。在现场附近的二万多市民对佐藤反动政府指使警察镇压人民反美爱国斗争的暴行表示非常愤怒。他们声援工人和学生的行动，向反动警察猛烈地投掷石块。到下午五点，爱国工人、学生和市民还在通往美军基地的桥上向反动警察愤怒抗议。斗争坚持了六个小时，直到晚间七点才结束。
    在日本人民群情激愤的抗议下，美军当局不得不下令禁止“企业号”的水兵上陆。
    宫本修正主义集团又一次帮助日本反动政府镇压人民的反美爱国斗争。在反动警察的同意下，这个叛徒集团的分子使用暴力阻止爱国学生参加抗议集会。他们还要求警察去用暴力镇压学生。他们的卑鄙行为受到在现场的广大市民的严正谴责。
    神奈川县、东京以及关东、东北地区的爱国工人和学生三千多人，二十一日在美国第七舰队基地横须贺举行了抗议集会。　
    大会结束后，全体与会者打着红旗，斗志昂扬地举行了游行示威。
    东京的工人、学生、妇女、贸易界人士等约七千人二十日在东京日比谷公园举行集会，强烈反对“企业号”停泊，谴责佐藤反动政府对爱国学生的镇压。
    与会者的头巾上写着：“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”会场上红旗林立，其中有写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的旗帜和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。会场上洋溢着日本人民同中国人民和越南人民团结战斗的气氛，会后举行了示威游行。
