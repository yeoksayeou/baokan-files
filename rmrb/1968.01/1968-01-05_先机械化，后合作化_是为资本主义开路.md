The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “In agriculture, under the conditions of our country… we must first have cooperativization, and then we can use large machinery.” Chairman Mao’s teachings creatively develop Marxism-Leninism and are the fundamental path for the collectivization of agriculture in our country.

However, China’s Khrushchev hates Chairman Mao’s teachings to the core and is in a state of panic. He hurriedly picked out the “mechanization first, then cooperativization” garbage from the dump of revisionism, blatantly opposing socialism, and is extremely reactionary. The great reality of collectivization in our rural areas has thoroughly refuted his fallacies.

Take our village for example. In the early days after liberation, after land reform, there was a period without collectivization, and serious polarization occurred. Within about a year, five households of poor and lower-middle peasants sold their land. Later, more than twenty households of poor and lower-middle peasants in our village actively responded to Chairman Mao’s call to take the path of collectivization, organized themselves, and established an agricultural cooperative. The members of the cooperative worked hard, relied on their own efforts, and displayed tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm. They made their own carts when there were none, and the members pulled the plows when there were no oxen. In less than two years, production rapidly developed, and the grain yield per unit area increased by nearly one fold. The cooperative quickly expanded from more than twenty households to more than one hundred households. Later, as the degree of collectivization increased, the level of mechanization also continuously improved, and production rose step by step, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of collectivization.

History is the best witness. Without mechanization, the rural areas of China have achieved collectivization, taken the socialist path, and gradually changed their poor and backward faces; under the condition of continuously consolidating and developing the collective economy, gradually realizing mechanization and electrification, and continuously improving the level of social productivity. If we follow China’s Khrushchev’s reactionary fallacies, before mechanization, the working people can only work individually. Wouldn’t this allow the polarization in the rural areas to continue? Wouldn’t this make the poor and lower-middle peasants who obtained land suffer again and become slaves to the landlord and rich peasant classes? China’s Khrushchev crazily advocates “mechanization first, then cooperativization,” which in essence is to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism and make the rural areas thoroughly capitalist.

    “先机械化，后合作化”是为资本主义开路
    五好战士　勾海洲
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在农业方面，在我国的条件下……，则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”毛主席的教导，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，是我国农业集体化的根本途径。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫对毛主席的教导恨之入骨，惊慌万状，急急忙忙从修正主义的垃圾堆里拣出了“先机械化，后合作化”的破烂货，赤裸裸地反对社会主义，真是反动透顶。我国农村集体化的伟大现实，彻底驳倒了他的谬论。
    就拿我们村来说吧，解放初期，在土改以后的一段时间里，由于没有集体化，一度出现了严重的两极分化，一年左右，就有五家贫下中农先后卖掉了土地。后来我们村二十多户贫下中农积极响应毛主席发出的走集体化道路的战斗号召，首先组织起来，成立了农业合作社。社员们奋发图强，自力更生，发扬了冲天的革命干劲。没有车，他们就自己造。没有牛，社员们就自己拉犁。不到两年，生产迅速发展，粮食单位面积产量增加将近一倍。合作社迅速扩大，由二十多户增加到一百多户。以后，随着集体化程度的提高，机械化程度也不断提高，生产更是步步上升，显示了集体化的无比优越。
    历史是最好的见证人。没有机械化，中国农村也实现了集体化，走上了社会主义道路，逐步改变着一穷二白的面貌；在集体经济不断巩固发展的条件下，逐步实现机械化、电气化，不断提高社会生产力水平。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，在没有机械化以前，劳动人民只能单干，这岂不是要放任农村的两极分化吗？这岂不是要让得到土地的贫下中农重新受苦受难，给地主、富农阶级当牛做马吗？中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地鼓吹“先机械化，后合作化”，实质上就是为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，使农村彻头彻尾资本主义化。
