The banks of the Gan River, under Jinggangshan, red flags fluttering in the wind like a painting. The excellent children of Jinggangshan, after more than a year of arduous and repeated struggles, have finally welcomed the unprecedented great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province.

The outstanding feature of Jiangxi Province's unprecedented great situation is: after our great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest directives were met by the broad revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province, a wave of earnest study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives quickly emerged. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the revolutionary situation over the past four months has developed like a rushing river, like a galloping horse, the ranks of the revolutionary left have grown and strengthened rapidly; the strongholds of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party have been smashed rapidly; the awakening of the deceived masses has been rapid; revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary tripartite alliances have been realized, consolidated, and developed rapidly; transportation and communication have been restored rapidly; industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly; the new revolutionary order has been established and stabilized rapidly. In a word, the children of Jinggangshan have closely and rapidly followed Chairman Mao's latest directives, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Following Chairman Mao Closely Means Victory

Jiangxi is the revolutionary old base area personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao. Forty years ago, Chairman Mao personally sowed the seeds of revolution here, established the first red political power, and built the first people's army in China, opening the correct path of revolution for all oppressed peoples in the world. Over the decades, the people of Jiangxi have proudly called themselves "children of Jinggangshan." They firmly believe from their personal experiences that following Chairman Mao closely means victory!

Over the past decade, despite the fact that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi have tried every means to block, resist, and distort Chairman Mao's directives, no one can shake the children of Jinggangshan's firm belief in always following Chairman Mao. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the children of Jinggangshan have been even more red-hearted and loyal, following Chairman Mao closely without leaving his side. They implement Chairman Mao's directives to the letter. Even those masses temporarily deceived by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, as soon as they see Chairman Mao's directives, they immediately implement them resolutely. In August last year, when the capitalist roaders in the Fuzhou area deceived and incited part of the masses to attack the revolutionary faction, a leader among the deceived masses said, "Chairman Mao has spoken, I was wrong," after seeing the relevant decisions of the Central Committee. He actively made a self-criticism to the revolutionary faction.

In September last year, at a critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi, our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Jiangxi and issued extremely important latest directives here, illuminating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's victory in Jiangxi and all over the country. The children of Jinggangshan, after hearing Chairman Mao's great directives, spread the word and competed to study and resolutely implement them. Chairman Mao called for the establishment of study classes, and various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes quickly sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, from cities to villages, from factories to schools, from the military to local areas. According to incomplete statistics, currently, the entire province has more than ten thousand study classes. Chairman Mao taught, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable major factions." Under the guidance of this latest directive from Chairman Mao, revolutionary great alliances immediately formed an irresistible torrent, and more than 90% of counties, cities, and units in the entire province quickly realized revolutionary great alliances by system, by department, and by class.

"Chairman Mao Loves Me, I Love Him"

"There can be no everything for the people without a people's army."

The People's Liberation Army, indeed, is the heroic army personally created by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. They stand firm, hold high the banner, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directives on "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," "protect the leftists," and "support the army and love the people." They are filled with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, supporting and protecting the proletarian revolutionary faction. Their outstanding representatives are the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and comrade Li Wenzhong, the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," from the 4th Company, 6th Platoon, 601st Division. Like the heroic 4th Platoon, they took "Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao directs me, I advance" as their guiding principle, using their lives and blood to protect the proletarian revolutionary faction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi.

The People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the army is not only a fighting force but mainly a working force," with class feelings, propagandized Chairman Mao's latest directives. Whether to the proletarian revolutionary faction or to the deceived masses, they did a large amount of in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work. They resolutely supported and endorsed the actions of the masses that conformed to Chairman Mao's latest directives; they resolutely persuaded and educated those that did not conform to Chairman Mao's latest directives. They made outstanding contributions to the construction of the revolutionary faction's ranks and the rapid awakening of the deceived masses.

"Defend Chairman Mao, I am willing to die"

"Beheading is not scary, as long as the cause is true. Defend Chairman Mao, I am willing to die." This is the oath made by the broad proletarian revolutionary faction in Jiangxi Province to defend Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they bravely raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, despite the risk of being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and "monsters and demons," and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi. They smashed through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, defeating the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. When they were severely suppressed and tortured again in March last year, they sang "Looking up, I see the North Star, in my heart, I think of Mao Zedong," holding the red book, repeatedly reviewing the great teacher Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, summing up lessons, and reorganizing the vast revolutionary army to continue the struggle and achieve new victories. When a handful of capitalist roaders incited part of the deceived masses to leave their production posts, causing some mines and factories to stop work and disrupting transportation and communication, the revolutionary workers and revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" with the sky-high enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, vigorously promoting production, quickly restoring transportation and communication, and rapidly increasing industrial and agricultural production, soon ushering in a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production. When a handful of capitalist roaders blocked Chairman Mao's voice and the policies of the Central Committee, the Red Guards of middle and high schools found every means to deliver newspapers to the workers and peasants. The Red Guards of the Jinggangshan Brigade of Nanchang No. 7 Middle School went deep into the vast rural areas along the Gan River and the shores of Poyang Lake, delivering leaflets propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the policies of the Central Committee to the broad masses of peasants.

Personally Visiting the "Frontline" to Spread Chairman Mao's Voice

Since its establishment four months ago, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, placing the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives at the forefront of all work. When the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee was established in August last year, it was precisely when the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Jiangxi were making a desperate comeback. At that time, Chairman Mao's voice could not be spread, and many masses were temporarily deceived and stood in the wrong camp. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee took spreading Chairman Mao's voice, propagating the party's policies, and turning them into the actions of the masses as the sole work purpose and the most fundamental work task. The first issue discussed at their first meeting after their establishment, the first work item arranged, was how to spread Chairman Mao's voice to the people of the entire province as quickly, widely, and directly as possible. In addition to mobilizing all propaganda forces to quickly propagate Chairman Mao's directives, they also organized three batches of tripartite Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of ten thousand people, going deep into mines, rural areas, and mountainous regions to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies. The leading comrades of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee personally went to the places and units with the most problems and the sharpest contradictions to directly propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They went deep into the workshops of mines and had discussions with old workers, went to rural areas to investigate among poor and lower-middle peasants, grasped typical examples, led the general situation, and powerfully promoted the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly turning around the situation of revolution and production. The leading comrades of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee deeply felt: only by implementing Mao Zedong Thought, making the masses grasp it, and acting according to it, can Jiangxi's face be fundamentally changed. Now, they are leading the people of the entire province to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, determined to popularize Mao Zedong Thought to every corner, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, and under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, advance from victory to new victories!

    井岗山下风展红旗如画
    ——记江西省无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势
    赣江两岸，井冈山下，风展红旗如画。优秀的井冈山儿女，经过历时一年多的艰苦的反复的斗争，终于迎来了江西省无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势。
    江西省形势空前大好的突出特点是：我们的伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示同江西省广大革命人民见面以后，迅速出现了一个群众性的认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的最新指示的热潮。在毛主席最新指示的指引下，四个多月来的革命形势的发展如江河奔泻，快马加鞭，革命左派的队伍成长壮大得快；党内一小撮走资派的顽固堡垒被摧毁得快；受蒙蔽的群众觉悟得快；革命大联合和革命三结合实现、巩固和发展得快；交通运输恢复得快；工农业生产发展得快；革命的新秩序建立和稳定得快。一句话，井冈山儿女对毛主席的最新指示，对毛主席的伟大战略部署，跟得紧、跟得快。
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    江西是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的革命老根据地。四十年前，毛主席就在这里亲手撒下了革命的火种，创建了第一个红色政权，建立了中国第一支人民的军队，为全世界一切被压迫的人民开辟了正确的革命道路。几十年来，江西人民都以自豪的心情把自己称为“井冈山儿女”。他们从亲身经历中坚定地相信一个伟大的真理：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！
    十几年来，尽管中国赫鲁晓夫和他在江西的代理人，千方百计地封锁、抵制和歪曲毛主席的指示，但是谁也动摇不了井冈山儿女永远紧跟毛主席的坚定信心。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，井冈山儿女更是赤胆红心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离。他们对毛主席的指示句句照办。即使是那些暂时受党内一小撮走资派蒙蔽的群众，只要毛主席的指示和他们一见面，他们也是立即照办，坚决照办。去年八月份，当抚州地区的走资派蒙蔽和挑动一部分群众围攻革命派时，受蒙蔽群众中的一个头头看到党中央的有关决定后，马上说：“毛主席说话了，我错了。”他主动向革命派作了检查。
    去年九月间，正当江西无产阶级文化大革命处于关键性的时刻，伟大领袖毛主席亲临江西视察，在这里发出了极为重要的最新指示，照耀着江西和全国各地的无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进。井冈山儿女听了毛主席的伟大指示，奔走相告，竞相学习，坚决执行。毛主席号召办学习班，各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班就如雨后春笋，从城市到乡村，从工厂到学校，从部队到地方，迅速地开办起来。据不完全统计，目前，全省已有上万个学习班。毛主席教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”在毛主席这个最新指示指引下，革命大联合立即形成势不可挡的滚滚洪流，全省百分之九十以上的县、市和单位，迅速实现了按系统、按部门、按班级的革命大联合。
    “毛主席热爱我热爱”
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    人民解放军不愧为毛主席亲手缔造的、林副统帅亲自指挥的英雄军队。他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决执行了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”、“要保护左派”和“拥军爱民”的伟大指示。他们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，支持和保护无产阶级革命派。他们当中的突出代表，就是六○一一部队某部六连四排“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志。他们象英雄四排一样，以“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”为行动指南，用生命和鲜血保卫了无产阶级革命派，保卫了江西的无产阶级文化大革命。
    人民解放军按照毛主席“军队不但是一个战斗队，而且主要地是一个工作队”的教导，满怀阶级感情宣传毛主席的最新指示，无论对无产阶级革命派，或者对受蒙蔽的群众，都分别做了大量的深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作。群众的行动，凡是符合毛主席最新指示的，他们就坚决支持和拥护；凡是不符合毛主席最新指示的，他们就坚决说服教育。他们为革命派队伍的建设，为受蒙蔽群众的迅速觉醒，做出了卓越的贡献。
    “保卫毛主席，死了也甘心”
    “杀头不要紧，只要主义真。保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”这是江西省广大无产阶级革命派为了保卫毛主席和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所发出的誓言。无产阶级文化大革命刚开始，他们就冒着自己被打成“反革命”、“牛鬼蛇神”的危险，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在江西的代理人发起了猛攻。他们冲垮了资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍，把党内一小撮走资派打得落花流水。当去年三月重新受到严重的压抑和折磨的时候，他们又高唱着“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”，手捧着红彤彤的宝书，一遍又一遍地重温伟大导师毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，总结教训，重新组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，继续坚持斗争，并取得了新的胜利。当一小撮走资派挑动一部分受蒙蔽的群众脱离生产岗位，造成一些工矿停工停产、交通运输中断的时候，革命的工人和革命的贫农下中农，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以文化大革命焕发出来的冲天干劲，猛促生产，使交通运输迅速恢复，工农业生产节节上升，很快出现了工农业生产的新高潮。当一小撮走资派封锁毛主席的声音和党中央的政策的时候，大中学校的红卫兵小将千方百计把报纸送到工农群众中去。南昌七中井冈山兵团的红卫兵小将，深入赣江两岸和鄱阳湖畔的广大农村，把宣传毛泽东思想和党中央政策的传单，送给广大农民群众。
    亲临“前线”传播毛主席声音
    江西省革筹小组成立四个月来，一直高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把落实毛主席的一系列最新指示放在一切工作的首位。去年八月江西省革筹小组成立时，正是中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人进行疯狂反扑的时候。当时毛主席的声音传不下去，许多群众一时受了蒙蔽，站错了队伍。省革筹小组就把传播毛主席的声音、宣传党的政策，并使之变为群众的行动，做为唯一的工作宗旨，最根本的工作任务。他们成立后召开的第一次会议，讨论的第一个问题，安排的第一项工作，就是怎样把毛主席的声音最迅速、最广泛、最直接地送到全省人民群众中去。他们除了动员一切宣传力量迅速宣传毛主席的指示外，还先后组织了三批三结合的毛泽东思想万人宣传队，深入到工矿、农村和山区，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策。省革筹小组的领导同志亲自到问题最多、矛盾最尖锐的地方和单位，直接宣传毛泽东思想。他们深入到工矿车间和老工人座谈，到农村向贫农下中农作调查，抓典型，带一般，有力地推动了毛泽东思想的宣传，很快扭转了革命和生产的局面。省革筹小组的领导同志深刻地体会到：只有把毛泽东思想落实了，为群众掌握了，并且照着做了，才能彻底改变江西的面貌。现在，他们正在带领全省人民掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，决心把毛泽东思想普及到每一角落，把毛主席的最新指示全面落实下去，在伟大舵手毛主席的指引下，从胜利走向新的胜利！　本报记者
