Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon of revolutionary people. The Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," has recently been published in Punjabi in India. This is another great joy for the revolutionary people of India.

Since last year, the revolutionary people of India, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have embarked on the only correct path for the Indian revolution—the path of armed struggle led by Mao Zedong that led the Chinese people to seize political power. To advance the revolution, the Indian revolutionary people are eager to study the works of Chairman Mao. Last year, the Punjabi version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was published in India, along with reprints of the English version. Additionally, several standalone editions of Mao Zedong's works have been published in India. These brilliant works of Chairman Mao have been widely circulated among the revolutionary people of India and have been extremely warmly welcomed.

The Punjabi version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" includes a translation of the preface written by Comrade Lin Biao, a close comrade of Chairman Mao, and the translation of the "Preface to the Revised Edition."

The Punjabi version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is published by the New World Press of India. This press has also recently published two standalone editions of Chairman Mao's works: "It is Good, Not Bad, to Be Opposed by the Enemy" and "The Question of Independent Leadership in the United Front."

In Tokyo, the Oriental Bookstore has recently published the fourth volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" which collects Mao Zedong's brilliant discussions on the construction of the Party.

The cover of this book features a quotation from Chairman Mao: "To make a revolution, it is necessary to have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, which is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of revolution, no proletarian revolution can be victorious."

The publication of this book has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary left and the broad revolutionary masses in Japan.

In Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, two brilliant works of Chairman Mao, "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong" and "Some Estimates of the International Situation," have recently been translated into Bengali and published, receiving a warm welcome from the people of Pakistan.
