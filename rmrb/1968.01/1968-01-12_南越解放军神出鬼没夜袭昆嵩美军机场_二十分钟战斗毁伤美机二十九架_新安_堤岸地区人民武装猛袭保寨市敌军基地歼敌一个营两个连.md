West Saigon, January 10 — The brave and skilled liberation forces of South Vietnam's Kunshan Province launched a fierce attack on the American Kunshan military airfield in the early hours of January 10. In just 20 minutes of battle, they successfully destroyed and damaged 29 American aggressor aircraft, killing and injuring over 30 American invaders.

According to Western news agencies, the battle began at 3 AM. Under the cover of darkness, the Kunshan Province liberation forces stealthily infiltrated this important base, which is occupied by the American 173rd Airborne Brigade, and cleverly placed explosive packages. Soon after, the airfield was rocked by thunderous explosions, sending American planes up in flames and leaving the American aggressors in a state of panic and chaos. After the battle, the mouthpiece of the American ruling class, the Associated Press, trembled as it reported: "This is the third attack by the South Vietnamese liberation forces on American airfields in the past week," and "one of the largest offensives against the American aggressors this year."

Another report stated that on the morning of January 10, the South Vietnamese liberation forces, with the support of mortar fire, launched a fierce assault on the command center of an American military camp located about 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon. They annihilated over 30 American invaders guarding the command center. Earlier, on January 8, the liberation forces in the Mekong Delta also fought a brilliant ambush battle. When a group of American troops on a "sweeping" mission encountered fierce resistance from local military and civilians, the American 9th Infantry Division, upon hearing the news, hastily dispatched three battalions of invading troops to rescue them. The well-prepared liberation forces fiercely attacked the enemy in the rice fields and waterways. According to the reduced figures from Western news agencies, after a fierce battle, the liberation forces annihilated over 40 American aggressors and shot down three American aggressor aircraft, with all five American pilots on board killed or injured.

Hanoi, January 11 — According to the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, the liberation forces in the New An-Di An region of South Vietnam, with the support of local people, launched a fierce attack on the enemy base in the provincial capital of Bao Trai, Thua Thien Province, in the early hours of January 8. They caught the enemy off guard, annihilating a puppet army battalion and two companies of puppet special forces and security troops.

The report stated that the liberation forces' artillery first launched a fierce bombardment on all enemy barracks and bases within the Thua Thien military district, as well as the residence of the puppet provincial governor. Following this, the infantry launched a brave assault, quickly occupying the entire city of Bao Trai.

According to preliminary reports, the liberation forces destroyed the residence of the puppet governor, the accommodation for American "advisors," the puppet public security headquarters, enemy barracks, a puppet army battalion command post, and an ammunition depot. Additionally, the liberation forces opened a prison, freeing over 50 civilians who had been imprisoned by the enemy.

The people of Bao Trai joyfully welcomed the liberation forces with drums and gongs, and together with the soldiers, captured over a hundred scoundrels and "pacification" spies.
