	Editor's Note: Currently, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and all fronts are presenting a great situation.
	However, the class enemy will not resign themselves to defeat and are still making desperate struggles. In some places, the counter-revolutionary economism wind is blowing again, which is a new trick they are playing. Under the guise of "caring for the people's livelihood," they actually want to lead the people astray with economism, aiming to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and disrupt production.
	In this great situation, we must not relax our vigilance. We must thoroughly expose and resolutely strike at all the tricks and conspiracies of the class enemy.

	Smash Counter-Revolutionary Economism

	I am an official in the transportation system of Shaanxi Province. Recently, some units under our jurisdiction have shown tendencies of economism, which is worth noting.

	The production bonus for the employees of a certain automobile transportation company in our province has not been issued since the second quarter of 1966. Recently, under the instigation of a small clique with ulterior motives, this bonus has been restored. Not only that, but they also want to make up for the unissued amounts from the past. This erroneous practice has been resisted by revolutionary workers in the bank. However, they blatantly violated the state's financial management system and used the operating cash income from transportation to cover this expense.

	The broad masses quickly saw through their ugly faces and rose up to oppose economism. Revolutionary cadres who insist on their posts also fought resolutely. Some comrades, despite being threatened, did not give up their principles and resolutely exposed and criticized the small clique with ulterior motives, and patiently educated the masses who did not understand the truth. The revolutionary masses of a certain automobile repair factory, upon hearing the rumors spread by the bad elements about increasing heating fees, immediately tracked them down and promptly smashed the enemy's plot. In the face of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, whatever economism, whatever material incentives, etc., will definitely be thoroughly smashed!

专栏：革命群众来信

     编者按：当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，各条战线上都呈现出一派大好形势。
    但是，阶级敌人决不甘心于自己的失败，他们还在作垂死的挣扎。有的地方重新刮起的反革命经济主义的歪风，就是他们玩弄的新花招。他们打着“关心群众生活”的幌子，实际上是要把群众引到经济主义的邪路上去，以达到破坏文化大革命、破坏生产的罪恶目的。
    在大好形势下，我们决不可放松警惕，对于阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计，我们一定要彻底揭露，坚决打击。
    粉碎反革命经济主义
    我是陕西省交通系统的一个干部。最近，在我们所属的个别单位中，出现了一些经济主义倾向，很值得注意。
    我省某汽车运输公司职工的生产奖金，从一九六六年第二季度起就停发了。最近在一小撮别有用心的人挑动下，重新恢复了这种奖金。不仅如此，还要补发过去停发期间的款项。这种错误作法，受到了银行革命职工的抵制。但是，他们公然违反国家财政管理制度，从运输营业现金收入中，开支了这笔钱。
    广大群众很快看清了他们的丑恶面目，纷纷起来反对经济主义。坚持在各个工作岗位上的革命干部，也进行了坚决的斗争。有的同志受到威胁，也不放弃原则，坚决揭发和批判一小撮别有用心的人，并耐心教育不明真相的群众。某汽车修理厂的广大革命群众，听到坏人放出的提高取暖费的谣言时，马上跟踪追击，及时粉碎了敌人的阴谋。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，什么经济主义，什么物质刺激，等等，都一定会被彻底粉碎！
