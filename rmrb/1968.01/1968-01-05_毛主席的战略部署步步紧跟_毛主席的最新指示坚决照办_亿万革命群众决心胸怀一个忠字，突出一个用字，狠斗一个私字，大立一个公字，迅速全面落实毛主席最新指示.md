Follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and resolutely implement his latest instructions! Millions of revolutionary masses are determined to cherish the word "loyalty," emphasize the word "use," fiercely combat the word "self," and firmly establish the word "public," swiftly and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country, with profound class feelings of love for Chairman Mao, continue to deeply study the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They are determined to cherish the word "loyalty," emphasize the word "use," fiercely combat the word "self," and firmly establish the word "public," swiftly and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the brilliant year of 1968!

Many revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards in various regions have expressed their firm resolve to comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment while deeply studying the New Year's editorial. Revolutionary masses in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have stated during their study that they will deeply root the word "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They will firmly establish the word "public," thoroughly criticize the words "self" and "revisionism," and fully ignite revolutionary enthusiasm, truly following Chairman Mao without a moment's separation, becoming revolutionary cadres who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Comrades participating in the study session of Mao Zedong's works organized by the Preparatory Committee for the Revolutionary Great Alliance of the Guangzhou working class have pointed out, based on their personal experiences, that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people, and is fundamentally opposed to the bourgeoisie's "self." If one's mind is filled with the word "self," it is impossible to be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to fully and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We must raise the struggle against "self" to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao, with a revolutionary spirit of daring to confront the enemy, thoroughly criticize the word "self," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry out the Cultural Revolution even better. They also pointed out that whether to study and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a fundamental issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Studying and using, using as one studies, is for the public good and is loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. Studying without using is being a verbal revolutionary. We must work hard on the word "use," truly achieving quick and effective use, keeping up and following closely.

The Tianjin Marine Fishing Company, which has held several sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, requires each session's participants to focus on examining their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and how closely they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They take Comrade Li Wenzhong as an example, fiercely combating the word "self." They deeply feel that only by fiercely combating the word "self" can the word "loyalty" be firmly established, and only then can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be closely followed. The revolutionary workers of this company have expressed during their study of the New Year's editorial that they will turn the study classes into battlefields for combating "self" and criticizing revisionism, and into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. Through the study classes and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, they will engrave Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds and implement them in action. "Whether one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a genuine proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary people from various places have deeply realized through their own practice that only by overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be fully and unconditionally implemented, and new merits be made for the people in the great struggle to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The two revolutionary factions of Nanjing University, which achieved revolutionary great unity just before the New Year, sat together and had an intimate discussion during their study of the New Year's editorial. They said, "We achieved revolutionary great unity in response to Chairman Mao's great call, combating 'self' and criticizing revisionism, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit. In the future, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members; it is an issue of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism; it is an issue of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since this is the case, the issue of study style is a very important issue, the most important issue." Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have carried forward the good study style of linking theory with practice and seriously conducting self-criticism while studying the New Year's editorial.

Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 23 Middle School, who have achieved great successes in the past year and a half of the Cultural Revolution, have been using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the spirit of the editorial to examine their work and thoughts over the past few days. Many Red Guards have sincerely criticized themselves for not being able to accept criticism, determined to continue studying the "Old Three Articles," fiercely combating the word "self," overcoming arrogance and complacency, and other wrong thoughts, truly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Geology, and other institutions have held study and discussion meetings in the past few days, summarizing the experiences and lessons of the past year, and formulating action plans for the new year. In their plans, they all place the active study and application of Mao Zedong's works, the fierce combat against the word "self," the firm establishment of the word "public," and the arduous transformation of worldview in the most important position.

A batch of factories, enterprises, and schools in the Wuhan area that have relatively early established revolutionary committees are currently mobilizing the masses to examine their work, fiercely combat the word "self," revise this year's work plans, and implement the five combat tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial. All members of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuhan Water Conservancy and Electric Power Institute have deeply examined themselves for the past period, finding that due to some selfish thoughts in their minds, they have not yet fully implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The Revolutionary Committee decided to mobilize all revolutionary teachers and students in the institute to concentrate on studying the New Year's editorial in the coming week, comprehensively examine their work, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and formulate a combat plan to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution within this year.

    毛主席的战略部署步步紧跟  毛主席的最新指示坚决照办
    亿万革命群众决心胸怀一个忠字，突出一个用字，狠斗一个私字，大立一个公字，迅速全面落实毛主席最新指示
    据新华社四日讯　紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！全国各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，继续深入学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论，决心胸怀一个忠字，突出一个用字，狠斗一个私字，大立一个公字，迅速全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在光辉灿烂的一九六八年夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    许多地区的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和红卫兵小将，在深入学习元旦社论的时候，纷纷表达了他们一定要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的坚定意志。广西壮族自治区的许多革命群众在学习中表示，他们要把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线的忠字扎得深深的，把公字树得牢牢的，把私字和修字批得臭臭的，把革命干劲鼓得足足的，真正做到紧跟毛主席寸步不离，做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    参加广州工人阶级革命大联合筹备委员会举办的学习毛主席著作讲用会的同志们，结合自己的亲身经历，深有体会地指出，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是代表无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益的，是和资产阶级的私字根本对立的。头脑中有了私字，就不可能无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，就不可能不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示。我们一定要把斗私提到对毛主席忠不忠的高度，以敢于刺刀见红的革命精神，把私字斗臭，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把文化大革命搞得更好。他们还指出，学了毛主席的最新指示，用还是不用，这也是对毛主席和毛泽东思想忠不忠的根本立场、根本态度问题。学了就用，学一点就用一点，这就是为公，就是忠于毛泽东思想。学了不用，就是口头革命派。我们一定要在用字上狠下功夫，真正做到用得快，用得好，跟得上，跟得紧。
    连续开办了几期毛泽东思想学习班的天津海洋捕捞公司，每期学习班的学员们都要着重检查对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得紧不紧，并且以英雄李文忠为榜样，狠斗私字。他们深深体会到，只有对私字斗得狠，才能使忠字树得牢，才能对毛主席的最新指示跟得紧。这个公司的革命职工在学习元旦社论时，纷纷表示要把学习班办成斗私批修的战场，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，通过学习班和活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把毛主席的最新指示刻印在脑子里，落实在行动中。“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众从自己的实践中深刻地认识到，只有打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性，才能不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中继续为人民立新功。
    元旦前刚实现革命大联合的南京大学两派革命群众，在学习元旦社论时，坐在一起亲密地畅谈了他们的体会。他们说，我们实现革命大联合，是响应毛主席的伟大号召，斗私批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性的结果。今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众遵照毛主席的教导，在学习元旦社论中，发扬了理论联系实际、认真进行自我批评的好学风。
    在过去一年多的文化大革命中取得很大成绩的北京二十三中学的红卫兵小将和革命师生们，连日来用毛主席的最新指示和社论精神检查了自己的工作和思想。许多红卫兵小将对于听不得批评意见的情况作了诚恳的自我批评，决心要继续大学“老三篇”，狠斗私字，克服骄傲自满情绪和其他错误思想，真正做到对毛主席的最新指示句句照办。北京航空学院、北京地质学院等院校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，近几天纷纷举行学习讨论会，总结一年来的经验教训，制订新的一年的行动计划。在他们的计划中，都把活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗私字，大立公字，刻苦地改造世界观，放在最重要的位置上。
    武汉地区一批较早成立革命委员会的工厂企业和学校等单位，正在发动群众检查工作，狠斗私字，修订今年的工作计划，落实元旦社论提出的五项战斗任务。武汉水利电力学院革命委员会全体委员，深刻地检查了前一段由于自己头脑里存在一些私心杂念，以至对毛主席的一系列最新指示还没有做到条条落实。革委会决定在最近一周内发动全院革命师生集中学习元旦社论，全面检查工作，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，制订出在今年内夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗规划。
