The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held an expanded meeting, calling on the military and civilians to press forward and achieve a decisive victory over the U.S. imperialists.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 25th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently held an expanded meeting. The meeting commended the great victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam last year and called on the military and civilians of South Vietnam to press forward and achieve a decisive victory over the U.S. aggressors in the new year.

The meeting issued a communiqué stating: The expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, chaired by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, was held from January 15 to 17 this year. The meeting heard reports by Nguyen Huu Tho, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and Chairman of the Military Commission, and Nguyen Huu Tho, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The communiqué said: The meeting unanimously agreed that, despite the desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism, which increased its troops to nearly 500,000, brought in large quantities of modern weapons and war equipment to the South, and adopted extremely brutal warfare methods, implementing the "search and destroy" and "pacification" pincer strategy, the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys suffered even more severe defeats than the previous year. The "pincer offensive" was shattered, and a large number of U.S., puppet, and mercenary forces were annihilated, failing to achieve any strategic objectives.

The communiqué pointed out: The victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam last year are of great significance both militarily and politically. It laid a solid foundation for the military and civilians of South Vietnam to achieve even greater and more comprehensive victories in the new year, thwarting all the plots, methods, and plans of U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression.

The communiqué said: The meeting decided on the military direction for 1968, determining measures to enhance the effectiveness of annihilating the enemy, eliminating more U.S., puppet, and mercenary forces, thoroughly thwarting the enemy's "pacification" plots, and defending and expanding the liberated areas.

The communiqué said: While fighting, it is necessary to pay great attention to building and developing various people's liberation armed forces in terms of quantity and quality, continuously improving technical, tactical, and command levels, strengthening political and ideological work, further consolidating the revolutionary stance, maintaining firm fighting determination in any situation, vigorously promoting revolutionary heroism, and resolutely charging forward to achieve glorious victories.

The communiqué said: The meeting was pleased to see that the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, since its publication, has been warmly welcomed and responded to by people of all walks of life at home and overseas Chinese, and has received widespread sympathy and support from international public opinion. The meeting decided to continue to widely propagate the political program to people of all strata in rural and urban areas, as well as to personnel of the puppet army and puppet government.

The communiqué called on the military and civilians of the South to heighten vigilance, enhance fighting spirit, and give a resolute and appropriate response to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys who violate and sabotage the order of the National Liberation Front to stop military attacks during the Tet holiday.

    公报说：会议一致认为，过去一年里，尽管美帝国主义拚命挣扎，把美军增加到近五十万名，把大量的现代化武器和战争工具运进南方，采取极其残暴的战争手段，加紧推行“寻歼”和“绥靖”钳形计划，但是，美国强盗及其走狗遭到了比前一年更加惨重的失败，“钳形攻势”被粉碎了，美、伪军和帮凶军的大量有生力量被歼灭，各项战略目标都没有实现。
    公报指出：越南南方军民去年取得的胜利，在军事和政治上都具有十分重大的意义，它为南方军民在新的一年中夺取更加巨大、更加全面的新胜利，挫败美帝国主义的一切扩大侵略战争的阴谋、手段和计划，打下了稳固的基础。
    公报说：会议决定了一九六八年的军事方向，决定了提高歼敌效果，消灭更多的美、伪军和帮凶军，彻底挫败敌人的“绥靖”阴谋，保卫和扩大解放区的各项措施。
    公报说：在作战的同时，必须十分重视从数量和质量上建设和发展各种人民解放武装力量，不断地提高技术、战术和指挥水平，加强政治思想工作，进一步坚定革命立场，在任何情况下都坚定战斗决心，大力发扬革命英雄主义，坚决冲上前去，夺取辉煌的胜利。
    公报说：会议满意地看到，越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领自从公布之后，得到了国内各阶层人民和国外侨胞的热烈欢迎和响应，得到了世界广泛舆论的同情与支持。会议决定继续向农村和城市的各阶层人民，以及伪军和伪政权的人员广泛地宣传政治纲领。
    公报要求南方军民提高警惕，增强斗志，对违反和破坏民族解放阵线关于在春节期间停止军事进攻命令的美国强盗及其走狗，给予坚决的应有的回击。
