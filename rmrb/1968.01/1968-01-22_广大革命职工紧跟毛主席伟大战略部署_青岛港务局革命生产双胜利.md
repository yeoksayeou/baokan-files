Revolutionary production and work achievements at Qingdao Port Bureau

According to Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, the revolutionary workers at Qingdao Port Bureau, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have vigorously promoted the revolution and production, completing the annual cargo handling plan 22 days ahead of schedule in 1967, with a 17.5% increase compared to 1966. This year, they have achieved new successes in both revolution and production.

Qingdao Port is an important port for foreign trade in northern China, with trade relations with dozens of countries around the world. Since taking power in late January last year, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this port has continuously exceeded the cargo handling tasks, with foreign trade cargo handling exceeding the plan by 40.7%. The port also completed the coal handling task ahead of schedule last year, ensuring the coal supply for industrial production and people's livelihood in places like Shanghai.

Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, is the fundamental guarantee for Qingdao Port Bureau's achievements in both revolution and production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army comrades, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses of this port have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as well as the brilliant works such as the "Three Old Articles" and "On Correcting the Mistaken Ideas in the Party." They have linked their thoughts, overcome selfishness, and established public-mindedness. They have been strict with themselves and lenient with others, often engaging in self-criticism, and continuously consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution. They have also followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to launch a thorough criticism and repudiation of the revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "bonus system," "material incentives," and "expert path." They have eliminated the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the port bureau, greatly enhancing the political awareness of revolutionary workers.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," they organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further igniting the enthusiasm for learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They took the "Three Old Articles" as their motto, establishing the idea of working for the revolution, and insisting on revolutionary activities during leisure time and focusing on production during work hours. In the process of "grasp the revolution, promote production," revolutionary workers have displayed the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fighting several consecutive battles without rest in a short period). They have excellently completed the production tasks. Once, when a ten-thousand-ton ship arrived at the port to transport coal to support the Huadong region, the workers were full of fighting spirit and worked together. After the ship entered the port, they completed the coal loading task in just three hours, setting a new record in history.

The Qingdao Revolutionary Committee has shown great concern and support for the revolution and production at Qingdao Port. When the port's production tasks increased sharply and encountered difficulties, the Revolutionary Committee set up a temporary command post at the port, integrating the transportation, railway, foreign trade, and other departments with the port into a whole, cooperating and supporting each other. When the port encountered congestion twice, the Revolutionary Committee organized revolutionary factions and Red Guards from many units across the city to rush to the port for emergency transportation, ensuring smooth transportation.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao has provided great support to Qingdao Port in terms of political thought and manpower. The workers said, without the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, our revolution and production would not have achieved such great victories.

    广大革命职工紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署
    青岛港务局革命生产双胜利
    据新华社济南二十一日电　青岛港务局无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，一九六七年提前二十二天超额完成全年吞吐计划，比一九六六年增长了百分之十七点五。今年以来，革命和生产又取得了新的成绩。
    青岛港是我国北方对外贸易的重要港口，它与国际上几十个国家有着贸易往来。这个港的无产阶级革命派自去年一月底夺权以来，连续超额完成港口物资装卸任务，其中外贸物资的装卸量超过计划百分之四十点七。这个港在去年还超额完成了煤炭装卸任务，保证了上海等地工业生产和人民生活用煤的需要。
    活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，是青岛港务局取得革命、生产双胜利的根本保证。这个港的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在人民解放军同志的帮助下，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，以及“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，联系思想，破私立公，严以责己，宽以待人，多作自我批评，不断地巩固和发展了革命的大联合。他们还紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在全港大力开展革命大批判。他们彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家路线”等修正主义黑货，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在港务局所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，极大地提高了革命职工的政治觉悟。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，他们大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。他们以“老三篇”为座右铭，树立为革命做工的思想，坚持业余闹革命，工作时间搞好生产。在“抓革命，促生产”中，革命职工“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，出色地完成了生产任务。有一次，一艘万吨轮船来港装运支援华东地区的煤炭，职工们斗志昂扬，全力协作，船进港后，他们只用三个小时就完成了装煤任务，创造了历史上的新纪录。
    青岛市革命委员会对青岛港的革命和生产给予了热情的关怀和巨大的支持。在港口生产任务猛增，生产碰到困难的时刻，市革委会在港口设立了临时指挥部，把交通、铁路、外贸等部门和港口连成一个整体，互相协作，互相支援。在港口两次出现堵塞时，市革委会组织全市很多单位的革命派和红卫兵小将来到港口突击疏运，保证了运输畅通。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”驻青岛的人民解放军从政治思想和人力等各方面给予青岛港以极大的支援。职工们说，没有人民解放军的大力支援，我们的革命和生产就不能取得这样大的胜利。
