The proletarian class of Wuhan, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to fiercely combat the "private" character, sweep away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieve revolutionary great alliance on the basis of revolutionary principles. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

On January 10, 300,000 revolutionary workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers from various factories and enterprises across Wuhan held a grand meeting to celebrate the achievement of the revolutionary great alliance of the proletarian class in Wuhan.

The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region, including Zhang Yuying, Liu Feng, Xu Guofu, and Zhang Yuhua, as well as the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region Air Force, Wuhan Garrison, and Hubei Military Region, attended the meeting. Comrade Liu Feng, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the Wuhan Military Region, warmly congratulated the successful convening of the meeting. In his speech, Liu Feng hoped that the revolutionary workers in Wuhan would further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Garrison and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations also spoke at the meeting.

The heroic proletarian class of Wuhan is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. Over the past year and more, under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, united the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses across the city, and waged a resolute struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, such as Wang Renzhong, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and establishing immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "within the proletarian class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the proletarian class to necessarily split into two opposing factions," the proletarian class of Wuhan, with deep class feelings of boundless love, belief, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, immediately took action and launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions from the bottom up, unit by unit, to achieve revolutionary great alliance. So far, 90% of the factories and enterprises in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliance by system, industry, and workshop teams, and most factories and enterprises have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups.

Establishing and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promoting the revolutionary learning style advocated by Mao Zedong Thought, are fundamental measures taken by the proletarian class of Wuhan to achieve victory in the revolutionary great alliance. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the proletarian class of Wuhan immediately took action and established thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Since last October, these study classes have spread throughout the city's factories, workshops, and workers' residential areas, with tens of thousands of people participating in the study. Revolutionary workers, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as weapons, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, truly linking thought with reality, learning and applying in combination, focusing on application, creating new styles and achieving new levels, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and fully implementing them. Revolutionary workers consciously linked the elimination of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism with the struggle to change their worldview. They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fiercely combated selfishness, and fiercely attacked factionalism, quickly removing the ideological obstacles to achieving revolutionary great alliance. Revolutionary workers who have already achieved revolutionary great alliance in their units, with the city's revolutionary great alliance in mind, resolutely did not say anything that was not conducive to revolutionary great alliance, did not do anything that was not conducive to revolutionary great alliance, did not write any slogans that were not conducive to revolutionary great alliance, and did not participate in any meetings that were not conducive to revolutionary great alliance, making the market for "selfishness" smaller and smaller, and the banner of "publicness" higher and higher, with the revolutionary great alliance surging forward, unstoppable, finally achieving the great victory of the revolutionary great alliance of the proletarian class in Wuhan.

    武汉工人阶级实现革命大联合
    他们以毛主席最新指示为纲，狠斗私心，猛攻派性，迅速扫清实现革命大联合的思想障碍
    据新华社武汉十三日电 具有光荣革命传统的武汉地区工人阶级，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠斗“私”字，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在革命的原则基础上，迅速实现了全市工人阶级的革命大联合。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    一月十日，来自武汉全市各工厂、企业的三十万革命职工和人民解放军指战员隆重集会，热烈庆祝武汉地区工人阶级革命大联合的胜利实现。

    英雄的武汉地区工人阶级，最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话。在过去一年多的时间里，他们在伟大统帅毛主席的革命路线的光辉指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，团结全市广大的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，同中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人王任重之流，展开了坚决的斗争，赢得了武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，为武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示以后，武汉工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，立即闻风而动，雷厉风行，掀起了大学大用毛主席最新指示，自下而上一个单位一个单位地实现革命大联合的热潮。到目前为止，全市百分之九十的工厂、企业单位实现了按系统、按行业、按车间班组的革命大联合，绝大部分工厂、企业单位成立了革命委员会或革筹小组。
    大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，是武汉工人阶级取得革命大联合胜利的一项根本措施。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召后，武汉工人阶级闻风而动，大办毛泽东思想学习班。从去年十月以来，数以千计的毛泽东思想学习班遍及全市的工厂、车间和工人住区，数十万人参加了学习。革命职工以毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”为武器，斗私批修，切实做到联系思想，联系实际，学用结合，学一点，用一点，在用字上狠下功夫，学出了新风尚，用出了新水平，进一步把毛主席的最新指示，条条落实，全面落实。广大革命职工自觉地把铲除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，与破私立公，改造自己的世界观紧紧结合起来。他们以毛主席最新指示为纲，狠斗私心，猛攻派性，迅速扫清了实现革命大联合的思想障碍。已经实现了本单位革命大联合的革命职工，以全市革命大联合为重，坚决做到不利于革命大联合的话不说，不利于革命大联合的事不做，不利于革命大联合的标语不写，不利于革命大联合的会不参加，使“私”字的市场越来越小，“公”字的旗帜越举越高，革命大联合的洪流滚滚向前，势不可挡，终于取得武汉地区工人阶级革命大联合的伟大胜利。
