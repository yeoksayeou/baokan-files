New soldier Zhang Yumei of the Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Guizhou Military Region, used his blood to safeguard the safety of a passenger train. His heroic deed is being widely circulated among the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Guizhou Province. People praise Zhang Yumei as Chairman Mao's good soldier, a living Cai Yongxiang, and a model of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

Trains loaded with passengers and goods shuttle back and forth, speeding north and south. The soldiers of the Seventh Platoon of the Third Company, stationed at the Kalazhai Tunnel in Guizhou, are entrusted with the glorious task of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the safety of the tunnel. They vigilantly guard their posts day and night.

On the early morning of April 12, 1967, new soldier Zhang Yumei came to his post and listened intently to the sounds from all directions.

"Woo! Woo!" ... A train loaded with passengers sped into the Kalazhai Tunnel at lightning speed. When the locomotive was about to exit the tunnel, the vigilant Zhang Yumei, under the strong light of the locomotive, suddenly noticed a log lying across the tracks about a hundred meters ahead. He immediately realized, with his high class consciousness, that this was another attempt by the class enemy to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If the obstacle was not removed, a serious accident could occur. In this critical moment, the heroic soldier Zhang Yumei rushed towards the tracks and sprinted towards the log lying across them. Zhang Yumei ran ahead, and the train chased from behind at high speed. Zhang Yumei suddenly realized that it was too late to remove the obstacle a hundred meters ahead. At this critical moment, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai," and with great revolutionary spirit, he crossed the tracks, using his tall figure to signal an emergency to the driver. The train driver saw the figure in front of the train and immediately applied the emergency brake. The train stopped 21 meters away from the obstacle, averting a disastrous accident. However, the heroic soldier Zhang Yumei was hit by the train, sustaining a serious head injury and bleeding profusely, but his right hand still pointed forward ...

The soldiers of the Seventh Platoon rushed to Zhang Yumei, and the train's driver and crew also ran to him. People, with deep respect, unanimously praised the heroic soldier: "He is truly a faithful defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," "This is a living Cai Yongxiang we have seen with our own eyes!"

The 22-year-old heroic soldier Zhang Yumei was born into a poor peasant family in Dejiang County, Guizhou. Before enlisting, he was a good member and militia of the commune, and had been commended three times for his contributions to socialist construction. In the spring of 1966, Zhang Yumei, with hatred for the domestic and foreign class enemies and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, joined the People's Liberation Army with the determination to defend socialist motherland to the death. Upon arriving at the unit, when a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was handed to him, he held it to his chest with both hands and, with immense excitement, swore to Chairman Mao: "Great leader Chairman Mao, I will definitely follow your instructions and be your good soldier." He had no education, so he asked his comrades to teach him word by word, and he copied and memorized word by word. When he first finished copying the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," his heart was filled with excitement! He opened his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wrote "Long live Chairman Mao" in neat characters under Mao's portrait.

The place guarded by the Seventh Platoon is relatively harsh, with no electricity at night, so Zhang Yumei found an iron box and made a small kerosene lamp to continue studying Chairman Mao's works. The kerosene lamp lit up the Seventh Platoon's living quarters, and Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the soldiers' hearts. Zhang Yumei, who loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most, often read Mao's books word by word under the small kerosene lamp late at night after getting off duty. He often told the platoon leader: "We are guarding the railway here, which is a task given to us by Chairman Mao. I will definitely stand guard for the people like Zhang Side."

With the great leader Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhang Yumei became even more vigilant in guarding the tunnel entrance. He watched the trains loaded with Red Guards revolutionary youths coming and going, feeling immensely proud. He cut out pictures of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards revolutionary youths from newspapers and pasted them on his bed, expressing his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Zhang Yumei firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, always using the words "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine his thoughts and actions; always using the two "extremes" to examine his every word and deed, and fiercely fighting against selfishness. One day, it was Zhang Yumei's turn to fetch water and cook in the platoon. When he was carrying a full load of water back, he slipped and fell, soaking himself. The cold wind made him shiver. He planned to go back and change his clothes before fetching more water. Just as he turned around, he suddenly stopped, thinking, "This is not selflessness." Falling down and getting a little wet, why think of oneself first! Zhang Yumei resolutely picked up the water buckets and walked forward, carrying several loads before changing his clothes. The platoon leader praised him in the platoon meeting, and he said: "There is still selfishness and egoism in my mind, far from the selflessness of Norman Bethune."

Zhang Yumei always set high standards for himself, often saying: "Doing revolution must be genuine, without any selfishness," "If you can carry a hundred pounds, you should not carry ninety-nine." One day, the salt in the platoon ran out, and they had to borrow some from the Eighth Platoon. Zhang Yumei had just left the door when he remembered that the Eighth Platoon was far away and fetching water was difficult, so he immediately picked up the water buckets and brought water to the Eighth Platoon. When the platoon leader asked him about this, he said: "Things that can be done should be done decisively, and things that are beneficial to the revolution and comrades should be thought of and done more."

The great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call of "Support the Army and Love the People." Zhang Yumei followed Chairman Mao's teachings and was injured while safeguarding the safety of the train. The train, carrying the deep affection of the people for the People's Liberation Army and the heroic soldier, rushed Zhang Yumei to the hospital at the fastest speed. The door of the ward was suddenly crowded with countless people visiting the heroic soldier. Many passengers on the train waited for a long time outside the ward, eager to donate blood to the heroic soldier. Some people, after donating blood, still waited for the hero to wake up. Zhang Yumei had a long and wide wound on his forehead, his skull had a star-shaped fracture, and he had lost a large amount of blood. After being admitted to the hospital, he was in a coma, and his life was in serious danger.

The next day, Zhang Yumei regained consciousness, and the nurse gently told him: "The train is safe, and all passengers are safe. You are truly Chairman Mao's good soldier." Zhang Yumei struggled to reply: "According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I still have not done enough."

As soon as Zhang Yumei's consciousness cleared a bit and his swollen eyes could barely open, he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall. He suddenly felt full of strength, humming "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations. Mao Zedong Thought gave him unyielding willpower, helping him overcome the various pains in the treatment process. The number of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards visiting the heroic soldier increased day by day. Zhang Yumei treasured the Mao badges and Mao quotations badges given to him by the people, drawing great encouragement from them, and his body gradually recovered. Countless revolutionary masses also gained great strength from the heroic soldier. The heroic soldier and the people together expressed: Mao Zedong Thought is our strongest spiritual force. Study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," smash selfishness, and establish public spirit. Always follow the great leader Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, always be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and sail towards the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao!

Now, Zhang Yumei has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. He follows the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and goes to the front line of "Three Supports and Two Militaries," determined to make new contributions to the people.

    毛主席的好战士张羽美
    ——记新战士张羽美用鲜血保卫列车安全的英雄事迹
    人民解放军贵州省军区某部三连新战士张羽美，用鲜血保卫了一列旅客列车的安全的英雄事迹，在贵州省的广大无产阶级革命派中间流传。人们赞扬张羽美是毛主席的好战士，是活着的蔡永祥，为大家树立了斗私批修的好榜样。
    一列列满载旅客和物资的列车穿梭而过、飞驰南北。守卫在贵州卡拉寨隧道的某部三连七班战士，肩负着保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫隧道安全的光荣任务，日日夜夜警惕地坚守着战斗岗位。
    去年四月十二日凌晨四时，新战士张羽美来到自己的哨位，全神贯注地倾听着远近四方。
    “呜！呜呜！”……满载着旅客的某次列车，以风驰电闪的速度驶进了卡拉寨隧道。当机车即将驶出隧道口的时候，机警的张羽美，借着机车的强烈灯光，猛然发现列车前方百米以外的铁轨上，横置着一根圆木。他以高度的阶级警惕性，立刻意识到，这是阶级敌人又一次妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶活动。障碍不排除，就可能发生一场严重的事故。在这万分紧急的一瞬间，英雄战士张羽美，猛然冲向铁轨，朝着横在铁轨上的圆木飞奔。张羽美在前面猛跑，列车以高速从后面追上来。张羽美猛然想到，要到百米以外去排除障碍，已经来不及了。就在这紧急关头，他遵循毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，以大无畏的革命精神，横越铁道，用自己高大的身形，向司机发出了紧急信号。列车司机发现了车前的人影，立即紧急刹车。列车在离障碍物二十一米处停了下来，一场不可设想的事故避免了，可是，英雄战士张羽美，却被列车碰倒，他头负重伤，鲜血直流，但他的右手仍指着前方……
    七班战士们向张羽美跑来，列车上的司机、乘务人员也向张羽美跑来。人们以无比崇敬的心情，齐声赞誉着英雄战士：“不愧是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者”、“这是我们亲眼见到的活着的蔡永祥！”
    二十二岁的英雄战士张羽美，出生在贵州德江县一个贫农的家庭里。入伍前，他是公社的好社员、好民兵，在社会主义建设中，曾三次受到嘉奖。一九六六年春天，张羽美怀着对国内外阶级敌人的仇恨，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，抱着誓死保卫社会主义祖国的决心，参加了人民解放军。一到连队，当把一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》发给他时，他双手捧
  在胸前，以万分激动的心情向毛主席宣誓：伟大领袖毛主席，我一定好好遵照您老人家的指示办事，做您老人家的好战士。他没有文化，便请战友们一字一句地教，他一字一句地抄，一字一句地记。当他第一次全文抄完《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作时，他的心是多么激动啊！他打开《毛主席语录》本，在毛主席像下面，工工整整地写下了“毛主席万岁”五个大字。
    七班守卫的地方，环境比较艰苦，晚上没有电灯，张羽美便找来一个铁皮盒子，做了一盏小煤油灯，坚持学习毛主席著作。煤油灯照亮了七班居住的地方，毛泽东思想照亮了战士的心房。最爱读毛主席书的张羽美，经常一个人在深夜下岗后，还点起小煤油灯，一字一句地读着毛主席的书。他常常对班长说：“我们在这里守护铁路，是毛主席交给我们的任务，我一定象张思德那样，全心全意地为人民站好岗。”
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在全国轰轰烈烈开展起来后，张羽美更加警惕地守卫在隧道口旁。他目送着一列列满载红卫兵革命小将的列车南来北往，感到无比的自豪。他从报纸上，把毛主席接见红卫兵革命小将的照片，一张张剪下来，贴在自己的床头上，表达自己对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    张羽美牢牢记住毛主席的教导，时刻用“完全”“彻底”四个字来对照自己的思想和行动；时刻用两个“极端”来对照自己的一言一行，狠斗“私”字。有一天，班里轮到张羽美挑水做饭。他挑满一挑水往回走时，不慎失足滑倒，全身被水浇湿，冷风吹来，冻得他直抖。他打算回去换身衣服再来挑。他刚转过身去，又猛然止住了脚步，想到，这不是“忘我”精神。跌了一跤，弄湿了一点衣服，为什么就马上先想到自己！张羽美毅然挑起水桶往前走，一鼓作气，连挑了几担才换衣服。班长在班务会上表扬他，他说：我脑子里还有“私”字、“我”字，比毫无自私自利之心的白求恩，还差得很远。
    张羽美就是这样，用高标准来严格要求自己，他经常说：“干革命就要一点不掺假，不能有半点‘私’字”，“能挑一百斤，决不挑九十九”。有一天，班里的盐用完了，要到八班去借。张羽美刚出门，就想起八班路远挑水困难，他立即挑起水桶，给八班捎去水。班长问起他这件事，他说：“能办到的事，就要坚决去办，只要对革命、对同志有利的事，就要多想多干。”
    伟大领袖毛主席发出了“拥军爱民”的伟大号召。张羽美遵循毛主席的教导，为保卫列车的安全光荣负伤了。列车载着人民群众对人民解放军和英雄战士无比深厚的鱼水情谊，以最快的速度，把张羽美载到医院里。病房门前，顿时涌来无数看望英雄战士的人。乘坐这次列车的许多群众，久久地守候在病房门前，争先恐后地要为英雄战士输血，有的人输了血以后，还一直等候着英雄的苏醒……。张羽美由于前额被碰破一条又长又宽的伤口，颅骨出现星型折断，并且大量失血，入院后一直处于昏迷状态，生命受到严重威胁。
    第二天，张羽美才苏醒过来，护士同志急忙轻轻地对他说：“列车保住了，全体乘客的生命安全无恙，你不愧是毛主席的好战士。”张羽美吃力地回答说：“按照毛主席的教导，我还做得不够。”
    张羽美的神志稍一清醒，肿胀的双眼刚能勉强睁开，就一眼看见了墙上挂着的毛主席画像。他顿时觉得全身充满了力量，激动地哼起《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲，背诵起毛主席语录来。毛泽东思想给了他无比坚强的毅力，使他战胜了治疗过程中的种种痛苦。前来看望英雄战士的革命工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将，一天比一天多。张羽美把人们送给他的毛主席像章、毛主席语录章视如珍宝，从中受到了巨大鼓舞，身体也逐日恢复了健康。无数的革命群众，从英雄战士身上，也获得了巨大的力量。英雄战士和人民共同表示：毛泽东思想是我们最强大的精神力量，活学活用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，朝着伟大领袖毛主席所指引的航向，永远向前！
    现在，张羽美已经伤愈出院。他按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，走上“三支”“两军”的第一线，决心为人民作出新的贡献。
