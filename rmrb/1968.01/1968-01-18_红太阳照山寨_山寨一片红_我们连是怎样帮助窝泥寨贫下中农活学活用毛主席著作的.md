Our People's Liberation Army has grown up under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong. Studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is our lifelong most glorious and most significant combat mission. Over the past year, we have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings that our army is not only a combat force but also a production and work force. Together with the local people, we have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoted the ideological revolution of the people, and pushed forward the production high tide in the countryside.

Spreading Mao Zedong Thought is the Greatest Form of Loving the People

Last May, our company moved into a remote mountain village—Woni Le Village.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Woni Le Village suffered immense exploitation and oppression from landlords, the Kuomintang bandits, and other reactionary forces before liberation. Their lives were extremely impoverished. A thunderclap of spring, Chairman Mao's sunlight illuminated Woni Le Village. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, they carried out land reform and gradually achieved agricultural cooperation, establishing people's communes. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Woni Le Village love Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts, praising him as the "greatest benefactor," the "greatest savior," and the "most red sun in their hearts." However, due to the efforts of the top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to resist and sabotage the peasants' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, obstructing the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and relentlessly pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, this mountain village was politically and culturally isolated. Apart from one accountant who was a graduate of primary school, most people were illiterate. They could neither listen to the radio nor read newspapers, so they knew very little about the Cultural Revolution.

Faced with such a situation, how should we do our work of loving the people? We seriously studied the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "The Red Army is not just a fighting force. Apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it also has the heavy responsibility of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses establish revolutionary political power, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party." We realized that: widely and deeply propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, turning the local area into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and arming the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental measure to ensure that our socialist country will never change color. It is the center of our work, the root of the root, an urgent political task, and also the greatest form of loving the people. After entering the village, our first slogan was "Long live Chairman Mao!" The first song we sang was "The East is Red," the first play we performed was "Long Live the Three Articles," and the first gifts we gave to the people were portraits of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao badges, and the brilliant "Three Articles." Soon, every household in the village hung a new portrait of Chairman Mao, every door had red Chairman Mao quotations, everyone wore a shiny Chairman Mao badge, and everywhere you could hear the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's teachings, grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. The entire village presented a scene of revolutionary fervor and joy that had never been seen before.

Establishing the First Mao Zedong Thought Study Class

Chairman Mao taught us: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative ideas, especially in the socialist era." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we first focused on organizing the militia to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The Party branch of the company formed a "Militia Work Group" consisting of the mass work commissioner and seven active members of studying Chairman Mao's works, establishing the first Mao Zedong Thought study class.

Before the study began, we mobilized all the militia in the village, propagating the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works, and organizing them to recall bitterness and sweetness, arousing their deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, greatly stimulating their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works. On this basis, we guided them to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, helping them further understand why they should be militia members and how to be good militia members of Chairman Mao. Facing the situation where the majority of militia members were illiterate, we adopted the method of "intensive lectures and extensive discussions" during the study, helping them repeatedly study and memorize until they could recite them. To improve everyone's self-study ability, we also helped them learn culture. After a period of study, most militia members could recognize, write, and use the Chairman Mao quotations they had learned. The study class also closely combined with the work of each period, studying what was needed for the work, learning while doing, and using while doing. The class consciousness of the militia was significantly improved. Female militia leader Peng Guihua said: "Chairman Mao's books are treasures, every word shines with gold. Reading them makes one's mind clear and eyes bright. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and do a better job in revolution and production."

The lively deeds of the militia in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works were highly praised by all the villagers, who commended them: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is exemplary, labor and production are models, and all work is outstanding."

Letting Mao Zedong Thought Take Root in Every Household

To ensure that all the women with many children in the village, as well as the elderly and children, could read Chairman Mao's books, the Party branch decided to turn every household into a red Mao Zedong Thought study class. Each team of our company established a family study guidance group, with everyone becoming a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, using the evening time to organize the people to study in their homes.

At that time, the company had a lot of work to do. We had to do a good job of propaganda without neglecting our work, which was a big contradiction. Facing this situation, the Party branch organized the cadres and soldiers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and the great call of "Support the Army and Love the People," as well as Vice Chairman Lin's directive to "turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." This made everyone realize that: no matter how much support, the greatest support is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how much love for the people, the greatest love is to help the people study Chairman Mao's works; turning the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought is the most important matter to ensure that our country does not change color and to support the world revolution. Everyone expressed that they would definitely plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every household of the village. With deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, all the comrades of the company, regardless of how tired they were during the day or whether it was windy or rainy, always carried Chairman Mao's red book and went deep into every household, sitting knee to knee with the commune members, helping them study Chairman Mao's works. Sometimes, after work, without washing their faces, changing clothes, or eating, they insisted on continuing. They would not stop.

The poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao the most and liked to read Chairman Mao's books the most. In the village, there was an old woman named Long, who was over fifty years old and had a family of sixteen. During a session of recalling bitterness and sweetness, the old woman recalled the tragic scene of her family having no food, no shelter, and no clothes in the old society, and her husband being killed by the Kuomintang bandits. She looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao and said excitedly: "The great savior Chairman Mao rescued us from the jaws of the tiger. I cannot repay his great kindness with anything." The soldier sitting next to her said: "Aunt, you are right! Without Chairman Mao, we poor people would never have been able to stand up. We love Chairman Mao, so we must read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. Not studying Chairman Mao's works is forgetting our roots and will lead us astray." Later, the guidance group analyzed the active thoughts of the old woman's family and focused on guiding them to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." The soldiers read sentence by sentence, and they listened sentence by sentence; the soldiers explained sentence by sentence, and they learned sentence by sentence. They also composed some rhymes to help them remember and understand the spirit of the articles. To inspire them to study and apply actively, the soldiers, including Zhou Guosheng, dared to speak out their thoughts and fight against their selfishness during the guidance, sharing their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Seeing the soldiers speak out their selfish thoughts without shame and fight against their selfishness without fear, they also dared to speak out boldly. Once, during a family study session, Old Woman Long took the lead in speaking, saying: "Chairman Mao's books are the golden keys that open all locks, and every sentence speaks to my heart. In the past, I always wanted my son Zhao Xi to come back. After studying 'Serve the People,' I opened my mind and asked Zhou comrade to write a letter to Zhao Xi, telling him to 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people in the army and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Her two sons checked their thoughts of not wanting to be cadres and decided to learn from Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. Her granddaughter Long Zhubing also said: "Chairman Mao's books are treasures. When there is a problem, we look for it. Once, I helped the PLA chop firewood and wanted to carry more. Halfway through, I couldn't carry it anymore. At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Hard work is like a burden, placed in front of us, see if we dare to bear it.' I sang the quotation song 'Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory,' and finally delivered the firewood to the PLA. Although I was very tired, I was very happy because I did something according to Chairman Mao's words."

Old Man Shen Zhaoyuan, after recalling bitterness and sweetness, studied Chairman Mao's works very seriously and loved to study more and more. Because of his old age and poor memory, when he encountered difficulties in studying, he would recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory." He specially made a quotation board and practiced writing "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Moving Mountains" whenever he had time. Now, every morning after he gets up, the first thing he does is to study a quotation from Chairman Mao and use it immediately. Once, when the team was distributing grass, Old Man Shen insisted on not taking any, saying: "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'completely forget about self and serve the people wholeheartedly.' I can go up the mountain to cut grass, so let's give this grass to those with less labor."

Every household in Woni Le Village was like Old Woman Long's and Old Man Shen's families, turning into Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They used Mao Zedong Thought to manage their homes, and when a family sat together, they would discuss the Cultural Revolution, national affairs, and study Chairman Mao's works. They deeply felt that: "Chairman Mao's books are the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must live a lifetime, use a lifetime, and follow Chairman Mao from generation to generation."

In the Great Storms of Class Struggle

Learning and Applying at New Levels

The country launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism, and we realized that we should follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, mobilize and organize the masses, and study Chairman Mao's works in the great storms of class struggle. We should break with selfishness and establish public spirit, guiding the masses' thoughts from caring about one family, one commune, or one team to caring about national affairs. Only by planting the roots and pillars of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the broad masses for thousands of years can we ensure that the country will never change color.

Based on our experience in carrying out revolutionary criticism, we first conducted in-depth and detailed ideological mobilization among the masses. When the masses heard that they were going to carry out revolutionary criticism, they had various reactions. Some said: "What's the use of criticism? Just pull him down from the horse." Some said: "I can't read a word, what can I criticize?" Based on these active thoughts of the masses, we went to every household, organizing them to study relevant articles in the newspapers and discussing with them the importance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev, the great significance of criticizing China's Khrushchev, and establishing the attitude of masters. The class consciousness of the masses was significantly improved. Deputy team leader Li Meiying said: "In the past, I advocated more private plots. This was because I was poisoned by China's Khrushchev and because of the 'selfishness' demon. If we don't overthrow 'selfishness,' we will follow China's Khrushchev." Everyone unanimously expressed: With Chairman Mao as our leader and the PLA as our support, we will definitely fight China's Khrushchev to the end! Thus, the revolutionary criticism was vigorously carried out throughout the village.

Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and we immediately organized the masses to study, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, further launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Through extensive recalling and comparing activities, we concentrated our efforts to criticize China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "exploitation is glorious," etc. Everyone angrily said: "Our village history and family history in the old society were written in blood and tears. The entire village was composed of hired laborers and tenants. We worked like oxen and horses, ate like pigs and dogs, and were so poor that the whole family had only one pair of pants to wear. Children froze to death, the elderly starved to death, and the young labored to death. China's Khrushchev's fallacies of 'exploitation is glorious' and 'three freedoms and one contract' want us to take the old road, which is absolutely not acceptable."

Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism greatly improved the socialist consciousness of the commune members. When turning in the public grain, they dried and winnowed the grain again and again. They said: "Reducing one part of moisture is reducing one part of selfishness and increasing one part of loyalty to Chairman Mao." Some cadres who used to be unwilling to be cadres again, fearing trouble and fearing criticism from the masses, now expressed: "China's Khrushchev dreams of seizing the power of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must definitely manage the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, and be lifelong servants of the people."

The Great Mao Zedong Thought Transforms into

Enormous Material Force

Chairman Mao taught us: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Woni Le Village used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against nature and achieve an agricultural harvest. Last July, just as the rice was about to form ears, more than eighty mu of rice in the entire team suddenly encountered a pest disaster. Seeing the black pests eating the green rice, everyone was very sad and anxious. Someone despairingly said: "There are so many pests, how can we catch them all? Forget it. Let them eat it all and we'll plant buckwheat." Faced with this situation, the team leaders also had no idea. At this time, our company's Party branch immediately held an emergency meeting to discuss the pest control issue. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to treat pest control as a political battle. Through pest control, we vigorously and thoroughly propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, helping them free themselves from various old ideas. All the comrades of the company, carrying Chairman Mao's red book, went deep into the masses, organizing everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought dispelled the fog in people's hearts, making their thoughts clear. Old Woman Long encouraged everyone, saying: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our comrades should see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage.' As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words and unite as one, we will definitely overcome the pest disaster." The militia members said proudly: "Pests are also paper tigers. We are not afraid of a few small pests, let alone the American imperialists!"

Every sentence and word of Chairman Mao's teachings gave the masses boundless strength, igniting sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm. The entire team's cadres actively led, the militia took the lead, and all the villagers mobilized, from children a few years old to elderly women with white hair, all went down to the rice fields, spraying pesticides and catching pests, forming a vast army of pest control. All the comrades of the company and the commune members fought together, establishing a field mobilization team. When they were tired, the soldiers and the masses would recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest);" when the 666 powder made them feel uncomfortable, they would loudly recite: "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory." The fields were filled with revolutionary fervor, and the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations echoed through the clouds, shaking the hills. After five or six days of battle, the pest disaster was basically eliminated. People enthusiastically cheered the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, cheering "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The new rice was harvested, and the masses, with the joy of victory, made steaming hot rice. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said: "If it weren't for the PLA propagating Mao Zedong Thought to us, how could we have such a good harvest! No matter how difficult, studying Chairman Mao's books makes it easy. This treasure, that treasure, only Chairman Mao's books are the real treasure! This disaster, that disaster, selfishness is the greatest disaster. This harm, that harm, China's Khrushchev is the greatest harm!" Everyone enthusiastically sang praises: "Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, the collective path is brighter and brighter! Following Chairman Mao, we will forever make revolution!"

Woni Le Village Became a Red Flag Village

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "Mao Zedong Thought can change people's ideological appearance, can change the appearance of the motherland, and can make the Chinese people stand up in the world and stand up forever." The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Woni Le Village had only been carried out for a few months, but people's spiritual appearance had been completely renewed. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants loved the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more, treating the study of Chairman Mao's works as the first need of life, "food can be skipped, but Chairman Mao's works cannot be skipped, and without studying Chairman Mao's works, food does not taste good." Now, everyone in the village can recite many quotations from Chairman Mao, and many people can recite the brilliant works "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Moving Mountains."

The red sun shines over the mountain village, and the village is all red. Living in the mountain village, thinking of Beijing, the red heart forever follows Chairman Mao. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought changed the appearance of Woni Le Village, and everyone agreed to change the name of Woni Le Village to "Red Flag Village."

To carry out new tasks, we had to leave Red Flag Village. Before leaving, we gave the poor and lower-middle peasants a gold plaque, on which was written: "The army and the people are united as one, see who can be our enemy in the world!" When we left the village, all the villagers came to see us off. Many elderly people, with tears of excitement, held our hands, reluctant to part, and spoke earnestly: "Our hearts are one, even if we are separated. You must forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and we must forever be good commune members of Chairman Mao."

We must definitely take the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as our lifelong most glorious, most significant, and most sacred political task, forever be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and truly achieve the red line wherever we go, the red patch wherever we stay, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought firmly wherever we go, letting it fly high forever!

    红太阳照山寨  山寨一片红
    ——我们连是怎样帮助窝泥寨贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的
    第二炮兵某部七连副指导员　张必全
    我们人民解放军是在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，是我们毕生最光荣、最重大的战斗任务。一年来，我们遵照毛主席关于我军既是战斗队，又是生产队、工作队的伟大教导，同驻地人民群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进了人民群众的思想革命化，推动了农村的生产高潮。
    传播毛泽东思想是最大的爱民
    去年五月，我们连进驻一个偏僻山村——窝泥寨。
    窝泥寨的贫下中农，解放前受尽了地主、蒋匪帮等反动势力的残酷剥削和压迫，生活极端贫困。一声春雷，毛主席的阳光照亮了窝泥寨，他们在毛主席的英明领导下，进行了土地改革，逐步实现了农业合作化，成立了人民公社。窝泥寨的贫下中农从心眼里无限热爱毛主席，称颂毛主席是“最大的恩人”、“最大的救星”、“心中最红的红太阳”。但是，由于党内最大的一小撮走资派极力抵制和破坏农民活学活用毛主席著作，阻碍毛泽东思想的传播，千方百计推行资产阶级反动路线，使这个山寨政治、文化很闭塞，全寨除一个会计是高小毕业生外，多数人都是文盲，既听不到广播，又看不到报纸，所以，对文化大革命的问题知道得很少。
    面对这样的情况，怎样去做好爱民工作呢？我们认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”认识到：在群众中广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，把驻地办成毛泽东思想大学校，用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，这是保证我国社会主义江山永不变色的最根本的措施，是我们工作的中心的中心，根本的根本，是刻不容缓的政治任务，也是最大的爱民。我们进寨后，呼的第一个口号是“毛主席万岁！”唱的第一支歌是《东方红》，演的第一场戏是《老三篇万岁》，送给群众的第一批礼物是毛主席像、毛主席像章和光辉的“老三篇”。很快寨子里家家挂起了崭新的毛主席像，户户张贴了红彤彤的毛主席语录，人人戴上了金光闪闪的毛主席像章，处处都能听到毛主席语录歌声。广大贫下中农遵照毛主席的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全寨呈现一片从来没有过的热气腾腾、喜气洋洋的革命景象。
  办起了第一个毛泽东思想学习班
    毛主席教导我们：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”遵照毛主席的教导，我们把组织群众活学活用毛主席著作的工作，首先放在发动民兵这一环上。由连队党支部的群众工作委员和七个学习毛主席著作积极分子组成了“民兵工作组”，开办第一个毛泽东思想学习班。
    学习开始前，我们向全寨民兵进行了动员，宣传学习毛主席著作的伟大意义，并组织他们忆苦思甜，激发了大家对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，大大地调动了他们学习毛主席著作的积极性。在这个基础上，辅导他们学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、人民战争的论述，使他们进一步明确了为什么当民兵和怎样当一个毛主席的好民兵的道理。针对民兵中文盲比例较大的情况，我们在学习中采取了“精讲多议”的方法，帮助他们反复学、反复记，直到背熟为止。为了提高大家的自学能力，还帮助他们学习文化。经过一段时间的学习，大多数民兵对所学的毛主席语录，都达到了会认、会写、会用。学习班还紧密结合每个时期的工作，干什么学什么，在干中学，在干中用，民兵的阶级觉悟有了显著提高。女民兵班长彭桂花说：“毛主席的书，句句是法宝，字字闪金光，读了心明眼亮。我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装起来，把革命和生产搞得更好。”
    民兵活学活用毛主席著作的生动事迹，受到了全寨群众的热烈赞扬，夸他们：“学习毛主席著作是榜样，劳动生产是模范，各项工作是标兵”。
  让毛泽东思想在家家户户扎根
    为了让全寨孩子多的妇女以及老年、儿童都能读到毛主席的书，党支部决定，把家家户户都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想学习班。我们连的团小组，每组成立一个家庭学习辅导组，人人都做毛泽东思想宣传员，利用晚上时间，深入到家庭去组织群众学习。
    当时，连里工作很忙，既要搞好宣传，又要不误工作，是个很大的矛盾。针对这种情况，党支部组织干部战士反复学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示和“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，以及林副主席关于“把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校”的指示。使大家认识到：千支援，万支援，宣传毛泽东思想是最大的支援；千爱民，万爱民，帮助群众学习毛主席著作是最大的爱民；把全国办成毛泽东思想大学校，是保证我们国家不变颜色和支援世界革命的头等重要大事。大家表示，一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全寨的家家户户。全连同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，不论白天工作多么疲劳，也不论刮风下雨，都带着毛主席的红书，深入到每家每户，和社员促膝谈心，帮助他们学习毛主席著作。有时收工晚了，脸不洗，衣不换，饭不吃，也坚持不懈，照样进行。
    贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最喜欢读毛主席的书。寨里有一位龙大娘，已经五十多岁了，全家十六口人。在一次忆苦思甜时，大娘回忆了在旧社会全家没有吃，没有住，没有穿，老伴被蒋匪军打死的悲惨情景。她抬头望着毛主席像，激动地说：“大救星毛主席把我们从虎口里救出来，我用什么也报答不了他老人家的大恩情。”在座的战士接着说：“大娘，你说得对呀！没有毛主席我们穷人就翻不了身。我们热爱毛主席，就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。不学毛主席著作就是忘了本，就会走错路。”以后辅导组分析了大娘一家的活思想，就重点辅导他们学习《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》。战士一句句地念，他们一句句地听；战士一句句地讲，他们一句句地学，还编一些顺口溜帮助他们记忆和领会文章精神。为了启发他们活学活用，战士周国盛等在辅导时大胆亮思想，斗私心，讲自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会。他们看到战士亮私不害羞，斗私不怕疼，也敢大胆发言了。有一次，开家庭讲用会，龙大娘带头发言，她说：“毛主席的书，是开万把锁的金钥匙，句句话说到我心窝里。过去我老想叫我儿子兆喜回来。学习了《为人民服务》，开了心窍，我就托周同志写信让兆喜在部队‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务，做毛主席的好战士。”她的两个儿子检查了不愿当干部的思想，决心向张思德、白求恩学习。小孙女龙竹英也说：“毛主席的书是法宝，有了问题把它找。有一次我帮助解放军打柴，总想多背点，走到半路背不动了，这时想起毛主席的：‘艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担’的教导，我就唱着‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’的语录歌，终于把柴送给了解放军。虽然累得够呛，但心里非常高兴，因为我按毛主席的话做了一件事。”
    沈兆元老大爷经过忆苦思甜，学习毛主席著作非常认真，越学越爱学。因为年纪大，记忆力差，学习遇到困难时，就背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他特地做了一块语录板，一有空就练写《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》。现在，他早晨起床后，第一件事就是学一条毛主席语录，学一句用一句。有一次队里分草，大爷坚决不要，他说：“毛主席教导我们要‘毫不利己专门利人’，我自己能上山割草，把这草分给劳力少的吧。”
    窝泥寨家家户户都象龙大娘、沈大爷家一样，变成了毛泽东思想学习班。他们用毛泽东思想当家，一家人坐在一起就是讲文化大革命，讲国家大事，学习毛主席著作。他们深有体会地说：“毛主席的书，是我们贫下中农的命根子，我们要活一世，用一世，世世代代永远跟着毛主席。”在阶级斗争的大风大浪中
    学出新水平用出新水平
    全国掀起了革命大批判的高潮，我们认识到，应当紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发动和组织群众，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里学习毛主席著作，破私立公，把群众的思想，由关心一家一户、一社一队，引导到关心国家的大事，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想在广大群众中打下千年的根基、万年的柱石，才能保证国家永不变色。
    我们根据自己开展革命大批判的经验，首先对群众进行了深入细致的思想动员。群众听说要搞革命大批判，产生了种种反应。有的说：“批判顶啥用，把他拉下马得了。”有的说：“咱斗大的字不识半口袋，能批个啥？”根据群众这些活思想，我们深入到各家各户去，组织他们学习报纸上的有关文章，和他们一起大谈无产阶级文化大革命的重要性，大摆中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，大讲批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的重大意义，树立主人翁的态度，群众的阶级觉悟有了显著提高。副队长李美英说：“过去我主张多分自留地，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，也是‘私’字作怪，不打倒‘私’字，就会跟着中国赫鲁晓夫跑。”大家一致表示：有毛主席给我们作主，有解放军给我们撑腰，坚决跟中国赫鲁晓夫拚到底！于是，革命大批判在全寨轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，我们就立即组织群众学习，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。通过大搞忆比活动，集中力量批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”和“剥削有功”等谬论。大家愤怒地说：“我们的寨史、家史，在旧社会是用血泪写成的。全寨都是长工和佃户，出的牛马力，吃的猪狗食，穷得全家只有一条裤子穿，小孩冻死，老人饿死，壮年累死。中国赫鲁晓夫的‘剥削有功’、‘三自一包’等谬论就是要我们走这条老路，这万万办不到。”
    斗私批修，大大地提高了社员的社会主义觉悟。交公粮时，他们把粮食晒了又晒，扬了又扬。他们说：
  “少一分水分，就是少一分私心，就是多一分对毛主席的忠诚。”有些干部过去不愿意再当干部，怕麻烦，怕群众提意见，现在表示：“中国赫鲁晓夫做梦都想夺贫下中农的权，我们偏偏要为贫下中农掌好权，紧跟毛主席干革命，当一辈子人民勤务员。”
      伟大的毛泽东思想转化为
  巨大的物质力量
    毛主席教导我们：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”窝泥寨的贫下中农，用毛泽东思想战天斗地，夺取农业丰收。去年七月中旬，正当稻子快打苞的时候，全队八十多亩稻子突然遇上虫灾。眼看黑糊糊的虫子吃着绿油油的稻子，大家非常痛心和焦急。有人失望地说：“虫子这样多，怎么能捉完？算了吧。吃光了好种荞子。”在这种情况面前，队干部也没主意了。这时我们连党支部立即召开紧急会议，讨论灭虫问题。经过讨论，一致决定：把治虫当成一次政治战役来打。通过治虫，大张旗鼓地、深入细致地向群众宣传毛泽东思想，帮助群众从各种旧思想的束缚下解放出来。全连同志带着毛主席的红书，深入到群众中去，组织大家反复学习毛主席关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗等教导。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驱散了人们心里的迷雾，使大家的思想明亮起来了。龙大娘鼓励大家说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’只要我们听毛主席的话，大家拧成一股绳，就一定能战胜虫灾。”民兵们豪迈地说：“害虫也是纸老虎，我们连美帝国主义都不怕，还怕几个小虫子？”
    毛主席的话，每一句每一字都使群众产生无比的力量，焕发出冲天的革命干劲。全队干部积极领导，民兵一马当先，全寨群众一齐出动，从几岁的小娃娃到白发苍苍的老大娘，都下到稻田里，撒药的撒药，捉虫的捉虫，形成了浩浩荡荡的灭虫大军。全连同志和社员一起战斗，成立了田间鼓动组。疲劳的时候，军民就背诵毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”；六六六粉呛得难受的时候，就大声背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”田野里一片热气腾腾，毛主席语录歌声响彻云霄，震动山岗。经过五、六天的战斗，虫害基本被消灭了。人们热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    新米打下来了，群众怀着胜利的喜悦，做出热腾腾的米饭。广大贫下中农说：“要不是解放军给我们宣传毛泽东思想，哪有这样的好收成啊！”“千难万难，学了毛主席的书就不难。这宝那宝，只有毛主席的书是真正的宝！这灾那灾，自私自利是最大的灾。这害那害，中国赫鲁晓夫是最大的害！”大家热情地歌颂：“毛泽东思想威力无穷，集体道路越走越明！跟着毛主席，永远干革命！”
      窝泥寨变成了红旗寨
    林副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想能够改变人的思想面貌，能够改变祖国的面貌，能够使中国人民在全世界面前站起来，永远站起来”。窝泥寨活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动才开展了几个月，人们的精神面貌却焕然一新。广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想更加热爱，他们把学习毛主席著作当作生活的第一需要，“饭可以不吃，毛主席著作不学不行，不学习毛主席著作，吃饭就不香。”现在全寨人都会背诵不少毛主席语录，许多人能背诵《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等光辉著作。
    红太阳照山寨，山寨一片红，身在山寨想北京，红心永向毛主席。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，改变了窝泥寨的面貌，大家一致同意把窝泥寨改名为“红旗寨”。
    为了执行新的任务，我们要离开红旗寨了，离寨前我们送给贫下中农一块金匾，上写着：军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？我们离寨时，全寨群众都来送行，很多老人含着激动的泪花，拉着我们的手，依依不舍，语重心长地说：“我们人分心不分，你们要永远做毛主席的好战士，我们要永远做毛主席的好社员。”
    我们一定要把宣传毛泽东思想作为我们毕生最光荣、最重大、最神圣的政治任务，永远做毛泽东思想宣传员，真正做到走起来红一线，驻下来红一片，走到哪里就把毛泽东思想伟大红旗牢牢地插到哪里，让她高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
