The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left. This is the glorious task entrusted to us by our great leader Chairman Mao. From our ten months of practice in intervening in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin, we deeply feel that to complete this glorious task, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unswervingly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and firmly support the left without supporting factions.

Supporting the left without supporting factions, fundamentally speaking, is to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest standard for measuring, identifying, and dealing with everything.

Supporting the left without supporting factions means firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, always directing the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and not at any part of the revolutionary masses. We do not support one faction to suppress another. We use the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

Supporting the left without supporting factions means adhering to the party principles of the proletariat, highlighting proletarian politics, and doing painstaking ideological and political work. We use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary ranks back onto the track of proletarian revolution. This promotes the great alliance, the three-in-one combination, and the great criticism, and pushes forward the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units.

Believe in the Majority of the Masses, Always Remember to Unite the Two "95%"

This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is the greatest revolutionary movement in human history. Without mobilizing hundreds of millions of people, it cannot be carried out; without relying on hundreds of millions of people, it cannot be won. This is the starting point for our insistence on supporting the left without supporting factions.

The revolutionary left, even if temporarily in the minority in terms of organization, as long as they politically represent the majority of the masses and are executors of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, must be firmly supported. Our purpose in supporting the left is to unite the broadest masses and attack the main enemy. As pointed out in the "Sixteen Points": "The Party's leadership should be good at discovering the left, developing and strengthening the leftist forces, and firmly relying on the revolutionary left. Only in this way can the most reactionary rightists be thoroughly isolated in the movement, the middle elements be won over, the majority be united, and through the movement, ultimately achieve the unity of more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses." Therefore, whether the left is temporarily in the minority and in a suppressed position, or in the majority and in a dominant position, our minds must always think of the majority of the masses, always remember to unite more than 95% of the cadres and masses, and guide them onto Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Practice has proven: Only by not forgetting to unite the majority can the left continuously develop and grow, and only then can a mighty revolutionary army be organized. When we first intervened in the Tianjin Cultural Revolution, there were two different approaches:

One approach was to favor one faction and cold-shoulder another. For the organization we supported, we treated them like brothers, studying, living, and fighting together with them; while for the organization we did not support, we did not approach them, did not participate in their activities, and even did not receive them when they came to the door. This approach often resulted in fostering factionalism, deepening the antagonism between mass organizations, and was not conducive to the development and growth of the leftist forces or the great alliance of the revolution.

The other approach was to support one faction and help another. While supporting a certain organization, we also actively approached other organizations, enthusiastically helped them, and supported their actions that conformed to Mao Zedong Thought. This approach developed and strengthened the leftist forces, united the majority of the masses, promoted the great alliance of the revolution, and isolated the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

This stark contrast made us further understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and clarify the following issues:

First, should we indulge or elevate the leftist organizations? We believe that we can only help them elevate, not indulge them. Leftist organizations and leftist masses are generally correct in their direction, but in the process of advancing, they inevitably encounter various shortcomings and mistakes. We support the left by supporting their actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and we do not unprincipledly support their incorrect actions. For example, some leftist organizations think they are the only ones who are truly leftist and revolutionary, and everything must revolve around them; some leftist organizations label organizations with different views as "old conservatives," trying to bring down and devour the opposing side. If we unprincipledly support these erroneous thoughts and actions, that would be supporting one faction to suppress another, fostering the leftist organizations' detachment from the masses. Only by continuously elevating their ideological awareness can we maintain their role as the vanguard of the revolution and make them the backbone of uniting and rallying the masses. Therefore, we, the supporters of the left, must be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and not members of any revolutionary mass organization. We hold high the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not the flag of any revolutionary mass organization.

Second, should we split from the organizations that have been deceived, or should we win them over ideologically and politically? We believe that the majority of the deceived masses love Chairman Mao and support socialism. Their problem is one of understanding. We should enthusiastically help them return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Changes in understanding take time, and if they do not understand immediately, we should patiently wait. As long as their understanding is elevated, they are proletarian revolutionaries, and we should support them. Practice has proven: Splitting from the deceived mass organizations organizationally is not conducive to uniting the majority of the masses; only winning them over ideologically and politically is conducive to isolating the handful of enemies. Some people say this is "conciliation," "compromise," "muddling through," and a "cotton-candy policy," which is incorrect.

Third, should we treat the mass organizations that oppose us due to the instigation of bad elements as enemy contradictions or as contradictions among the people? We believe that we must treat them as contradictions among the people. This does not mean there are no enemy contradictions. However, the true class enemies are only a handful, and they often hide behind the scenes to cause trouble; those on the front lines are mostly deceived masses. If we treat them with the methods used against enemies, we will fall into the enemies' trap, harm the masses, and make friends suffer and enemies rejoice. We firmly believe that once the masses awaken, the class enemies and a few bad leaders hidden within the mass organizations will be exposed in broad daylight and will be rooted out one by one by the masses.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how to treat the masses has always been the core issue of the struggle between the two lines. Believing in the majority of the masses and always remembering to unite the two "95%" is most in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao said: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." Only by uniting all those who can be united, can we guide the tens of millions of surging revolutionary army to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party!

Promote Mao Zedong Thought, Do Painstaking Ideological and Political Work

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and also a struggle between two ideologies, two worldviews, and public and private interests. Therefore, our support for the left is most importantly ideological and political support. This requires us to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to do painstaking ideological and political work for the broad masses. We do ideological and political work for the masses not to expand a certain revolutionary mass organization, nor to instill the views of a certain revolutionary mass organization into the masses; but to instill Mao Zedong Thought into the masses, strengthen the entire leftist forces, and make all revolutionary mass organizations unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite around Chairman Mao, and wholeheartedly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Doing painstaking ideological and political work requires us to be enthusiastic, patient, and sincere. Enthusiastic means treating the masses, especially the deceived masses, with deep class feelings. Tianjin City, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, organized representatives from workers, peasants, students, and other sectors to unite the revolutionary forces. All revolutionary mass organizations that participated in these representative meetings received support from the stationed troops. In April last year, a central leader received the Tianjin representatives and affirmed the revolutionary great alliance in Tianjin City, while also pointing out the shortcomings of the alliance not being thorough enough. According to the instructions of the central leader, we have since April focused our main efforts on consolidating, strengthening, and expanding the work of the representative meetings. However, during this period, some revolutionary mass organizations outside the representative meetings, due to the instigation of bad elements, once refused to cooperate with us and even took some extreme actions. For these masses, we have always insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to persuade and educate them, and using proletarian revolutionary feelings to inspire them. Every time they came in a threatening manner, we received them calmly and treated them as door-to-door mass work, dispatching a large number of cadres and soldiers to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to them. Patient means always, persistently, and repeatedly doing ideological and political work, firmly believing that the masses will advance under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The leaders of our stationed troops have many times gone door-to-door to do work for some influential mass organizations. If one visit does not work, we make a second visit; if a second visit does not work, we make a third visit; we go where we are invited and also go where we are not welcomed; we go to places where progress is smooth and also go to places where we encounter setbacks. In short, no matter what situation we encounter, we do not waver in our determination to unite, win over, persuade, and educate them. Sincere means often conducting frank criticism and self-criticism. When the masses are wrong, we help them in a factual and truthful manner from a place of care. When we are wrong, we seriously listen to the masses' criticism, thoroughly examine ourselves, and sincerely correct our mistakes. In these few months, we have many times invited some revolutionary mass organizations that have opinions about us for discussions to listen to their criticisms. In addition, we have organized hundreds of cadres at the regiment level and above to solicit opinions from various mass organizations, continuously correct our shortcomings and mistakes, and through the actual actions of correcting shortcomings and mistakes, do silent ideological and political work for the broad masses.

In our support-the-left work, we do not carry factionalism, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the highest standard for measuring everything, and do painstaking ideological and political work. This is to make the broad masses clearly see from our actions: Listening to factions, fighting for factional interests, and establishing factional prestige, the army does not support; listening to Chairman Mao, fighting for proletarian interests, the army supports.

In the process of insisting on doing painstaking ideological and political work for the masses, we have focused on the following issues:

First, we have vigorously promoted the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, turning Mao Zedong Thought into the soul of the masses. This is the fundamental aspect of our ideological and political work for the masses. We mainly propagate the great revolutionary practice of Chairman Mao, the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao, and the unparalleled might of Mao Zedong Thought, making the broad masses further deeply understand that listening to Chairman Mao is victory. At the same time, through inviting activists who study Chairman Mao's works to give reports, introducing the army's experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and jointly holding study-and-apply meetings with the masses, we guide the revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. We achieve learning a little and applying a little, learning and applying together, seeing immediate results, continuously transforming ourselves, and consciously overcoming the inconsistency between words and deeds, saying one thing and doing another, speaking beautifully in meetings but not doing so afterwards, and other wrong attitudes. Experience has proven: Grasping this fundamental aspect, ideological and political work can exert its maximum power, not only achieving immediate results but also having a long-term effect.

Second, we guide the masses to understand the essence of the struggle between the two lines. Some revolutionary mass organizations have long been in opposition and fighting "internal wars." They do not start from proletarian party spirit, directing the spearhead at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, but from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, directing the spearhead at the masses with different views from theirs. We do ideological and political work for these mass organizations, mainly organizing everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and also the primary question of the cultural revolution," repeatedly telling everyone: The essence of the struggle between the two lines is the question of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road; the proletarian revolutionary forces must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always directing the gun at the main target—the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Third, we inspire the masses to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, consciously overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some mass organizations have strong factionalism and high mountains, fundamentally because of the "self" factor. Some revolutionary masses only see themselves as the motive force of the revolution, not as the object of the revolution. Some conservative-minded masses, due to the constraints of old frameworks, cannot tolerate the actions of the revolutionary forces. We organize them to study and apply the "Old Five Articles," help them conduct rectification, inspire them to take Chairman Mao's teachings as the highest standard, consciously revolutionize themselves, and do more self-criticism. Many experiences have proven that helping the masses use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to practice self-criticism is the best method to level the mountains, overcome factionalism, elevate the understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and promote the great alliance of the revolution. Here, our attitude towards various factions of the masses is the same. Whether it is an organization that the army has supported or one that the army has not supported, whoever dares to fight to the death in the struggle against selfishness, we take them as an example and call on everyone to learn from them. Insisting on this approach can ensure that the leftist organizations continuously advance on Chairman Mao's revolutionary course and can also help cadres who have made mistakes and deceived masses to quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Doing in-depth and detailed ideological and political work for the masses and insisting on supporting the left without supporting factions is the process of establishing Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of the broad masses. The more Mao Zedong Thought there is in the minds of the masses, the clearer their eyes will be, the more firmly they will grasp the grand direction, and the more closely they will follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. After Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on the great alliance of the revolution, tens of thousands of revolutionary mass organizations in Tianjin City responded immediately and acted according to the latest instructions, creating a moving scene where leaders lead the masses and the masses urge the leaders, everyone follows Chairman Mao closely. In less than a week, the great alliance of the revolution was basically achieved throughout the city. After Chairman Mao issued the instructions to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," the revolutionary masses of the entire city immediately took action, and within a couple of months, they set up more than 7,800 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with 470,000 people participating in the study, quickly creating a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the city. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin City presented an unprecedentedly good situation.

In the Fiery Struggle, Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works, Continuously Promote the Thought Revolution of the Support-the-Left Personnel

Supporting the left without supporting factions is determined by the support-the-left personnel's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To achieve this, the key is to constantly study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the problems in the struggle, continuously promote the thought revolution of the troops, and let Mao Zedong Thought guide all our words and actions. For this, we firmly grasp the following three links:

First, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of various troops. This is a decisive aspect of supporting the left without supporting factions. Participating in the "three supports and two militaries" work in Tianjin are the army, navy, and air force, with more than ten large units. With so many troops together, it is natural to have different opinions on some issues, especially on the views of some mass organizations. Every time such a situation arises, we use Mao Zedong Thought to unify everyone's thoughts. First, we unify thoughts, policies, and actions in the temporary party committee of the army, navy, and air force support-the-left liaison station. Among the various troops, we establish a good atmosphere of mutual learning, mutual respect, and doing more self-criticism, making everyone think as one, look as one, and work as one. When the various troops unite, the evil plans of some people to sow discord among the troops will not succeed.

Second, continuously elevate the support-the-left personnel's understanding of the struggle between the two lines. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unprecedented, and if the support-the-left personnel do not take the struggle between the two lines as the key, do not link everything with the struggle between the two lines, and still use old frameworks to view the problems of the cultural revolution, they will make wrong judgments, stand in the wrong queue, say the wrong things, do the wrong things, and even support one faction to suppress another. Only by continuously deepening the support-the-left personnel's understanding of the struggle between the two lines and linking all related issues with the struggle between the two lines can we see clearly, recognize the direction, identify the target, and support the broad masses of the left.

Third, in the fiery struggle, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, continuously transform the subjective world. At every critical moment, whether we dare to insist on the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions is a battle between public and private interests in the mind. Supporting factions is sometimes easier to gain praise; while insisting on supporting the left without supporting factions, only supporting their correct actions and not unprincipledly supporting their incorrect actions, some organizations may have opinions about you, and sometimes all factions may be dissatisfied with you. Therefore, the support-the-left personnel must dare to break with selfishness and establish public spirit in the fiery struggle on the front line of the "three supports and two militaries" where the classroom is the largest, the teachers are the most numerous, and the teaching materials are the richest. They must dare to touch their souls and take themselves as the object of the revolution.

With the belief in the majority of the masses as the guiding ideology, insist on the party principles of supporting the left without supporting factions, and through the means of doing ideological and political work, achieve the goal of establishing Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of the broad masses. This is the most glorious task and the most sacred duty of our "three supports and two militaries" work.

    支左不支派
    中共天津驻军支左联络站临时委员会
    “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”这是伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。我们从介入天津市无产阶级文化大革命十一个月的实践中深深体会到，要完成这一光荣任务，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚持支左不支派。
    支左不支派，从根本上来说，就是要忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把毛泽东思想作为衡量一切、识别一切、对待一切的最高标准。
    支左不支派，就是要牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，始终把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资派，而不指向任何一部分革命群众，不支一派压一派，用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾。
    支左不支派，就是坚持无产阶级的党性原则，突出无产阶级政治，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，用伟大的毛泽东思想把革命队伍里的小资产阶级思想，引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来，促进革命的大联合、革命的三结合，推动革命的大批判和各单位的斗批改。
    相信群众的大多数，念念不忘团结两个“百分之九十五”
    我国这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上最伟大的革命运动，不发动亿万群众就搞不了，不依靠亿万群众就胜不了。这就是我们坚持支左不支派的立足点。
    革命的左派，即使在组织上暂时还处于少数，但只要在政治上是群众大多数的代表，是毛主席革命路线的执行者，就必须坚定地给予支持。我们支左的目的，是为了团结最广大的群众，攻击最主要的敌人。正象“十六条”中所指出的：“党的领导要善于发现左派，发展和壮大左派队伍，坚决依靠革命的左派。这样，才能够在运动中，彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，团结大多数，经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众。”因而，无论是在左派暂时人数还少、处于受压制地位，或是在左派占大多数、处于当权地位的时候，我们的头脑里，都要想到群众的大多数，都要念念不忘团结百分之九十五以上的干部和群众，把他们引导到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    事实证明：只有不忘团结大多数，才能使左派不断发展壮大，才能组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军。在我们刚介入天津市文化大革命时，曾经有两种不同的做法：
    一种是热一派，冷一派。对自己所支持的组织亲如兄弟，和它的成员一起学习、生活、战斗；而对不支持的组织则不同他们接近，不参加他们的活动，甚至找上门来也不接待。这样做的结果，往往是助长了派性，加深了群众组织之间的对立，不利于左派队伍的发展壮大，不利于革命的大联合。
    另一种是支一派，帮一派。在支持某一个组织的同时，对其他组织也主动地接近，满腔热情地帮助，支持他们符合毛泽东思想的言行。这样做的结果，发展和壮大了左派队伍，团结了群众的大多数，促进了革命的大联合，孤立了党内一小撮走资派。
    这个鲜明的对比，使我们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线有了进一步的认识，从而明确了以下几个问题：
    一是对左派组织是迁就还是提高？我们认为，只能帮助提高，不能姑息迁就。左派组织和左派群众，大方向是正确的，但在前进的过程中，不可避免地要出现这样那样的缺点、错误。我们支持左派，只能支持他们符合毛泽东思想的言行，而不能无原则地支持他们不正确的东西。例如，有些左派组织唯我独左，唯我独革，事事要以我为核心；还有一些左派组织，把持有不同观点的组织都说成是“老保”，想把对方搞垮，想把对方吃掉等等，如果我们无原则地支持他们这些错误思想和行动，那就是支一派、压一派，助长了左派组织脱离群众。只有不断提高他们的思想觉悟，才能使他们保持革命先锋的作用，才能使他们成为联系群众，团结群众的骨干。因此，我们支左人员，必须是毛泽东思想的宣传员，而不能是某一个革命群众组织的队员；我们所高举的是一面光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，而不是某一个革命群众组织的队旗。
    二是对受蒙蔽的群众组织，是从组织上分化，还是从思想上、政治上争取教育？我们认为，受蒙蔽的群众，绝大多数都是热爱毛主席、拥护社会主义的。他们的问题是认识问题。我们应该满腔热情地帮助他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。认识上的变化，需要一个过程，一时认识不到，也要耐心等待。只要认识提高了，杀了回马枪，就是无产阶级革命派，就应该给予支持。事实证明：对受蒙蔽的群众组织，单纯从组织上分化，不利于团结大多数群众；只有从思想上、政治上争取教育，才有利于孤立一小撮敌人。有人说这是“调和”、“折衷”、“和稀泥”，是“棉花路线”，这种认识是不对的。
    三是对一些受坏人挑拨而反对我们的群众组织，是把他们当作敌我矛盾处理，还是当作人民内部矛盾处理？我们认为，必须当作人民内部矛盾来处理。这里并不是说没有敌我矛盾。但是，真正的阶级敌人，只是一小撮，而且往往躲在幕后捣鬼；跑在第一线的，绝大多数是受蒙蔽的群众。我们如果用对付敌人的办法对待他们，就会中了敌人的诡计，就会伤害群众，就会使亲者痛，仇者快。我们坚信，群众一旦觉悟了，隐藏在群众组织里面的阶级敌人和少数坏头头，就会暴露在光天化日之下，就会被群众一个个地揪出来。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样对待群众，一直是两条路线斗争的核心问题。相信群众的大多数，念念不忘团结两个百分之九十五，最符合毛主席的革命路线。毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”只有团结一切可以团结的人们，才能把千千万万浩浩荡荡的革命大军，都引导到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，把党内一小撮走资派彻底打倒！
    大力宣传毛泽东思想，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”无产阶级文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的搏斗，也是两种思想、两种世界观、公与私的搏斗。因此，我们支持左派，最重要的是从思想上、政治上给予支持。这就必须以毛泽东思想为武器，向广大群众做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。我们向群众做思想政治工作，不是为了扩大某一个革命群众组织，也不是向群众灌输某一个革命群众组织的观点；而是向群众灌输毛泽东思想，壮大整个左派队伍，使各个革命群众组织都统一在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，紧紧地团结在毛主席的身边，同心同德把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，要做到热心、耐心、诚心。热心，就是用深厚的阶级感情对待群众，特别是受蒙蔽的群众。天津市是遵照毛主席、党中央的指示，通过组织工、农、学等几个代表会议把革命派联合起来的。凡是参加这几个代表会的革命群众组织，都是得到驻军支持的。去年四月，中央负责同志接见天津代表时，肯定了天津市的革命大联合，同时也指出了联合得不够等缺点。按照中央首长的指示，我们从四月份以后，就一直把主要的精力放在巩固、加强和扩大几个代表会议的工作上。但是在这段时间里，几个代表会议以外的一些革命群众组织，由于受了坏人的挑拨，一度不肯同我们合作，甚至采取了一些过激的行动。对于这一部分群众，我们始终坚持用毛泽东思想去说服教育他们，用无产阶级的革命感情去感召他们。每次他们气势汹汹而来，我们都是和和气气地加以接待，把他们当成送上门来的群众工作，派出大批干部、战士，向他们宣传毛泽东思想。耐心，就是要始终如一地、苦口婆心地、反复地做思想政治工作，坚信群众一定会在毛泽东思想指引下前进。我们驻军负责人曾多次登门去做一些有影响的群众组织的工作。一次做不通做二次，二次做不通做三次；要求我们去的我们去，不欢迎我们的我们也主动去；进展顺利的地方去，碰钉子的地方也去。总之，不论遇到任何情况，都不动摇我们团结、争取、说服、教育他们的决心。诚心，就是经常进行坦率的批评和自我批评。群众错了，我们从爱护出发实事求是地给予帮助。我们错了，就认真听取群众的批评，痛痛快快地检讨，诚诚恳恳地改正。在这几个月中，我们曾多次邀请一些对我们有意见的革命群众组织的负责人座谈，听取他们的批评。此外，还先后组织了几百名团以上干部去征求各群众组织的意见，不断改正我们的缺点、错误，通过改正缺点、错误的实际行动，向广大群众做无声的思想政治工作。
    我们在支左工作中，不带派性，坚持以毛泽东思想为衡量一切的最高准则，进行艰苦细致的思想政治工作，就是要使广大群众从我们的行动中清楚地看到：听派的话，争派的利益，树派的威望，解放军都不支持；听毛主席的话，争无产阶级的利益，解放军就支持。
    在坚持向群众做艰苦细致的思想政治工作中，我们着重抓了以下几个问题：
    第一、大抓活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想化为群众的灵魂。这是我们向群众做思想政治工作的根本。我们主要是通过大讲特讲毛主席的伟大革命实践，大讲特讲毛主席的英明伟大，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的无比威力等，使广大群众进一步深刻认识到，听毛主席的话就是胜利。同时，通过邀请学习毛主席著作积极分子作报告、介绍部队活学活用毛主席著作的经验和军民联合召开讲用会等方法，引导革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。做到学一点就用一点，学用结合，立竿见影，不断改造自己，自觉克服言行不一致，口头上说一套，行动上另是一套，会上讲的漂亮，会后不那样做等等错误态度。经验证明：抓住了这个根本，思想政治工作就能发挥最大的威力，不仅可以收到立竿见影的效果，而且能够长远起作用。
    第二、引导群众认识两条路线斗争的实质。有一些革命群众组织，长期闹对立，打“内战”。他们不是从无产阶级党性出发，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资派，而是从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性出发，把矛头对准跟自己持不同观点的群众。我们向这些群众组织做思想政治工作，主要是组织大家活学活用毛主席关于
  “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，反复告诉大家：两条路线斗争的实质，是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的问题；无产阶级革命派一定要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把枪口对准最主要的目标——党内一小撮走资派。
    第三、启发群众破私立公，自觉克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。一些群众组织派性大，山头高，根本原因是“私”字作怪。有一些革命群众，只把自己当成革命的动力，没把自己当成革命的对象。一些思想保守的群众，则因受旧框框的束缚而看不惯革命派的行动。我们组织他们活学活用“老五篇”，帮助他们进行整风，启发他们以毛主席的教导为最高准则，自觉革命，多做自我批评。许多经验证明，帮助群众用毛泽东思想做武器，实行自我批评，是铲平山头，克服派性，提高对毛主席革命路线的认识和促进革命大联合最好的方法。在这里，我们对各派群众的态度都是一样的。不论是部队支持过的组织还是未支持过的组织，谁在斗私上敢于刺刀见红，就以谁为榜样，号召大家向他学习。坚持这样做，就可以保证左派组织不断在毛主席的革命航道上前进，也能够帮助犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众，尽早回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    向群众做深入细致的思想政治工作，坚持支左不支派的过程，就是在广大群众头脑里大立毛泽东思想的过程。群众头脑里毛泽东思想更多了，眼睛更明了，大方向掌握得更牢了，对毛主席的伟大战略部署也就跟得更紧了。毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示一发出，天津市成千上万个革命群众组织闻风而动，立即按最新指示办事，出现了一个头头带群众，群众促头头，人人紧跟毛主席的动人情景，在不到一个星期的时间里，就基本上实现了全市的革命大联合。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的指示以后，全市革命群众又立即行动起来，在一两个月的时间内，就办起了七千八百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有四十七万人参加了学习，很快在全市出现了一个活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。天津市的无产阶级文化大革命，呈现了一片空前大好的形势。
    在火热的斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，不断促进支左人员思想革命化
    支左不支派，决定的因素是支左人员对毛主席无限忠诚，对毛泽东思想无限忠诚，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚。要做到这一点，关键在于经常带着斗争中的问题活学活用毛主席著作，不断促进部队思想革命化，让毛泽东思想指挥我们的一切言论和行动。为此，我们紧紧地抓住以下三个环节：
    第一，用毛泽东思想统一各个部队的思想。这是做到支左不支派的一个起决定作用的方面。在天津参加“三支”“两军”工作的，有陆海空三军十几个大单位。这么多部队在一起，在对待一些问题上、尤其是对一些群众组织的看法上有不同意见，是很自然的。每当出现这种情况的时候，我们就用毛泽东思想把大家的思想统一起来。首先是在陆海空三军支左联络站临时党委中统一思想，统一政策，统一行动。在各部队之间，树立起互相学习，互相尊重，多做自我批评的良好风气，使大家心往一处想，眼往一处看，劲往一处使。各部队团结一致了，一些坏人妄图挑拨军队之间的关系的阴谋，也就不能得逞。
    第二，不断提高支左人员对两条路线斗争的认识。无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的，支左人员如果不以两条路线斗争为纲，不把一切事物同两条路线斗争联系起来，还用旧框框看待文化大革命的问题，就要认错门，站错队，说错话，办错事，甚至支持一派，压制一派。只有不断加深支左人员对两条路线斗争的理解，把有关问题都同两条路线斗争联系起来看，才能心明眼亮，认清方向，认定目标，支持左派广大群众。
    第三，在火热的斗争中破私立公，不断改造主观世界。在每个关键时刻，敢不敢坚持支左不支派的原则，都是头脑里一次公和私的战斗。支派，在某些时候比较容易得到赞扬；而坚持支左不支派，只支持他们正确的言行，不是无原则地支持他们的不正确的言行，有些组织就可能对你有意见，甚至有时候会几派都不满意你。因此，支左人员一定要敢于在课堂最大、教员最多、教材最丰富的“三支”“两军”第一线的火热斗争中，破私立公，狠触自己的灵魂，把自己当作革命的对象。
    以相信群众大多数为主导思想，坚持支左不支派的党性原则，通过做思想政治工作的途径，达到在广大群众头脑中大立毛泽东思想的目的。这就是我们“三支”“两军”工作最光荣的任务，最崇高的职责。
