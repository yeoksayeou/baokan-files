The exhibition of China's "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculptures and photographs opened in Hanoi on the afternoon of the 20th, receiving a warm welcome from the Vietnamese people.

The exhibition was jointly organized by the Vietnam Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, and the Vietnam Association of Art Workers.

In the central hall of the exhibition venue, a large photograph of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, warmly shaking hands, was prominently displayed. On either side of the hall were quotations from Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho.

The exhibition features all the photographs and ten replicas of the clay sculptures from the "Rent Collection Courtyard."

Attending the opening ceremony were: Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee Phan Hung, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Ky Tho, and Deputy Minister of Culture Nguyen Duc Khuong, among others.

In his opening speech, Phan Hung said: "The clay sculptures of the 'Rent Collection Courtyard' are a great achievement by Chinese artists under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They vividly depict class struggle through artistic forms, possessing strong appeal and significant political educational value."

Phan Hung said that this exhibition will further arouse the Vietnamese people's hatred towards American imperialism and its lackeys, and further inspire the Vietnamese military and civilians to achieve greater victories in their struggle against the Americans and for national salvation.

He said that this exhibition is also a good opportunity for Vietnamese artists to learn from the experience of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving politics, and serving class struggle, so as to better serve the Vietnamese people's revolutionary cause of resisting the Americans and saving the nation.

The acting head of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Lu Weiqiang, and diplomatic personnel from the embassy and the Chinese Economic Representative Office in Vietnam were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.
