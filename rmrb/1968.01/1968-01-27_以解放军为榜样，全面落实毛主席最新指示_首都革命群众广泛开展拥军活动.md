The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the capital, in response to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," are carrying out mass activities to support the army. Through these activities, they have even greater faith in and reliance on the People's Liberation Army, and even greater support for and love of the People's Liberation Army. They are determined to learn from the PLA, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to ensure that every aspect of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is implemented.

Currently, the capital's support-the-army activities are forming a wave. From the Municipal Revolutionary Committee to the district (county) and grassroots revolutionary committees, revolutionary preparatory committees, and revolutionary mass organizations, all place great importance on further improving support-the-army activities. Many grassroots units and districts (counties) have recently held support-the-army symposiums, study-the-PLA symposiums, support-the-army and love-the-people meetings, and military-civilian joint celebrations. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, schools, and government agencies believe that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the same way as the PLA is the best way to support the army. They take the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and the model comrade Li Wenzhong as their examples and are determined to push the movement to study Chairman Mao's works to new heights. The Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau Guang'anmen Station recently invited the PLA comrades who are supporting the left to introduce to the revolutionary workers the army's experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the army's experiences in emphasizing politics, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the three-eight style. This guided the revolutionary workers to learn from the PLA, to look in the mirror, to find gaps, to improve their study style, and to bring about a new high tide in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works at this station. The broad revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, taking the soldiers of the 8341st Unit who are supporting the left in the factory as their examples, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further eliminate the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

In the capital, revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres, in their support-the-army activities, widely publicize the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the "three supports and two militaries" work. They unanimously believe that the troops stationed in Beijing and the broad officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have a firm stand and clear banner, and share the same breath and fate with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. They have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. The broad revolutionary masses love the PLA more and more. They say, the PLA is truly a great army built by Chairman Mao, a great wall.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses believe that supporting the PLA's "three supports and two militaries" work with actual actions is the most practical and specific way to support the army. They fight against factionalism, correctly handle the PLA's support-the-left work, and under the help of the PLA, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Many units' revolutionary masses also organize Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, carrying red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges, to visit local troops and "three supports and two militaries" units, to visit military families, families of martyrs, and honorable military personnel.

  “两军”工作，是最实际最具体的拥军。他们围剿派性，正确对待解放军的支左工作，在解放军帮助下，认真贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
