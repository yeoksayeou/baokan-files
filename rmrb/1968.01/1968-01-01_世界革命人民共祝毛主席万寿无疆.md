The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the globe. The wisdom of Chairman Mao is broader than the five continents, and the love of the world's revolutionary people for Chairman Mao is deeper than the four oceans. Revolutionary people around the world unanimously wish Chairman Mao a long life. This is the most heartfelt wish of the people of all countries. This wish contains the world's people's deep respect, faith, love, hope, and strength!

A wish is a profound expression of internationalism. The great leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, sincerely wishes Comrade Mao Zedong to be "as long-lived as our mountains," expressing the Albanian people's deepest affection for Chairman Mao. In heroic Albania, even children a few years old will affectionately call out "Mao Zedong" when they see a portrait of Chairman Mao. A woman from an Albanian handicraft cooperative enthusiastically embroidered a red flag to present to Chairman Mao with a Chinese student who was about to return home. On the flag, she embroidered: "Chairman Mao, wishing you a long life!" The worker said, "I really want to embroider the Albanian people's boundless love for Chairman Mao on this flag!"

A wish is a high salute in battle. A comrade from Vietnam fighting on the anti-American front wrote a passionate poem, wishing Chairman Mao "a long life, shining over the globe." Comrade Nguyen Binh of Vietnam expressed the Vietnamese people's heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought: "Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun in the east, illuminating our hearts, strengthening our revolutionary thoughts and will, and adding fighting spirit to our struggle to thoroughly defeat the American imperialist aggressors and modern revisionists." Countless letters from South Vietnam to Chinese comrades, known as "Southern Letters," brought the deepest revolutionary feelings of the South Vietnamese people's love for Chairman Mao. These letters often traveled thousands of miles, taking months or even more than a year, passing through many enthusiastic hands and battlefields before reaching the hands of Chinese comrades. The letters said, "We are very grateful for Chairman Mao's kindness!" "The greatest help the Chinese people have given to the Vietnamese people is Chairman Mao's military thought."

A wish is a beautiful song of praise. A British youth sent a New Year's card to a Chinese friend, neatly writing: "Today is December 26, wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" That night, a Pakistani student studying in Britain hung a portrait of Chairman Mao in front of a radiant lamp. He spoke meaningfully, "This symbolizes that Chairman Mao has brought light to the people." A revolutionary family in Bulgaria, where everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, embroidered a fine tablecloth and two handkerchiefs with thousands of needles and threads, and wrote a most heartfelt letter of blessing to Chairman Mao from a distant place, asking to have these gifts "delivered to the most beloved leader, Chairman Mao." On an autumn day, a unemployed couple from Yugoslavia presented a potted "evergreen plant" to a Chinese friend, expressing their most heartfelt blessings for Chairman Mao. A Nepalese friend, Awasi, wrote in a letter, "There is a red sun in the sky, and there is Mao Zedong on the earth; the sun in the sky shines brightly, and the sun on the earth illuminates the four directions." A Greek cargo ship entered the port of Zhanjiang, China. An old sailor, upon seeing a Chinese worker, raised his thumb and said, "Chairman Mao is truly great!" He took out a silk pouch, from which he took out a shiny red Chairman Mao badge, holding the Chinese friend's hand earnestly and saying, "Please convey to the Chinese people that the Greek people and all the people of the world wish Chairman Mao a long life!" Once, the "Matroshka" ship arrived at Qingdao port. A foreign sailor, as soon as he stepped ashore, took out a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said to the Chinese worker, "For the people of the world, the most important thing is this precious book, which contains all the truths." He then opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud. On the day he left Qingdao, he filled a cup with wine, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, and raised the cup high, saying with deep emotion, "Heartfelt wishes for your long life!"

A wish is a great encouragement. Revolutionary people of various countries regard Chairman Mao's excellent health as the greatest happiness and joy for the people of the world. The news of Chairman Mao's excellent health spread around the world, bringing the greatest encouragement to the world's revolutionary people. The news reached war-torn Vietnam, and a Vietnamese comrade, Yingang, wrote to Chinese comrades, "In the fierce battle against the vicious American aggressors, I, like all the Vietnamese people, felt limitless excitement upon hearing this news. Because this is the greatest happiness for the 31 million Vietnamese people fighting on the battlefield and for all the people of the world." The news reached the mountains of Laos, and an over-100-year-old Miao woman sang with an ancient folk tune, "Chairman Mao! The red sun rising in China forever shines over the land of Laos!" The news reached Japan, and three revolutionaries jointly wrote to Chinese friends, "For the world's proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations, Chairman Mao's health is more valuable than anything else. This news has increased our courage to fight against American imperialism." The news reached Cuba, and an old couple exclaimed, "Great! Great! This is a tremendous piece of news!" The news reached the Malian students in the Soviet Union, and a Malian student said, "This is the most encouraging and happiest news for me. This is the best news in the world."

Revolutionary people around the world, in different places, using different languages and methods, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

"Long live Mao Zedong!" This is a battle oath. "Wanling (ten thousand years), Mao Zedong!" The Lao people's soldiers guarding the front line of Phukot Mountain shouted it and rushed into battle. "Oye (ten thousand years), Mao Zedong!" The youth of Congo (Brazzaville) shouted it, saluting a statue of Chairman Mao, expressing their revolutionary resolve. "Ura (ten thousand years), Mao Zedong!" A Soviet woman shouted it, pointing to her chest and firmly telling the Chinese comrades, "They (the Soviet revisionists) don't let us shout, but I will shout! Forever shout!" "Langliv (ten thousand years), Mao Zedong!" American workers shouted it, fighting against the American reactionaries.

"Long live Mao Zedong!" This is the source of strength. An old man in a Bulgarian village placed a woven portrait of Chairman Mao in a gold-framed mirror, hanging it in the most prominent place in the room. He would respectfully gaze at the portrait of Chairman Mao every day. He said, "Because whenever I see the portrait of Chairman Mao, I feel full of strength and can overcome any difficulty." A student from a middle school in Warsaw, Poland, inspired by the spirit of "It's right to rebel," pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao in the center of the classroom one night, with two slogans on either side: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with Brezhnev!" The school authorities, upon discovering it, were terrified and immediately removed the portrait of Chairman Mao and the slogans, threatening, "Never do this again." However, the next day, the shining words "Long live Chairman Mao!" appeared again on the stairs of the teaching building. Chinese sailors once received a blood-stained letter from Indian revolutionaries in an Indian prison, which read, "We yearn for the most precious book in the world—Mao Zedong's works. Long live the great Chairman Mao!" The great Mao Zedong Thought gave the Indian revolutionaries in prison a strong will to fight and a firm belief in victory. Whenever the reactionaries beat them to the point of being covered in wounds, they would recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "All the persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only serve to hasten the people's more extensive and more violent revolution." In a dense forest in Latin America, a guerrilla fighter stood on a misty mountain, gazing deeply at the east, waiting for the sun to rise. He held a gun seized from the enemy in one hand and waved a red book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," in the other. He opened the first page, "Mao Zedong!" He shouted aloud, raising his head. The sun in the east rose, rose! The blazing sunlight dispersed the clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, pierced through the treetops of the forest, and shone on the faces of the fighters. They, full of vitality, faced the rising red sun in the east, shouting "Long live!" and welcoming the new battle.

"Long live Mao Zedong!" This is the belief in victory. Some revolutionaries in Indonesia, upon receiving the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao," would enthusiastically shout this slogan full of boundless power. They firmly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' The path of Mao Zedong is the only path to liberation for the Indonesian people! Our relatives suffering in water and fire will definitely be liberated!" A poor old worker in Switzerland, upon seeing a portrait of Chairman Mao, respectfully bowed. "Long live Chairman Mao!" He shouted involuntarily. He said, "Chairman Mao is the embodiment of truth, the savior of workers." He and his wife listened to Beijing Radio broadcasts every day, sometimes two or three times a day, year after year. He said, "Every time we hear Chairman Mao's name on the radio, our whole family feels very happy."

"Long live Mao Zedong!" This is a shout of happiness. One night, a fuel worker on the Cypriot ship "Anglich" docked in a Chinese port suddenly got up from his bed and quietly approached the Chinese duty personnel, asking the Chinese friend to teach him to read and write the five shining words "Long live Chairman Mao" in Chinese. He said, "This sentence is the voice of all the people of the world. I must learn it!" Later, he finally learned to read and write it. Therefore, he often raised his thumb and proudly shouted this slogan in Chinese. Last year in May, the ship "Volena" arrived in Qingdao from Dar es Salaam. Some foreign sailors immediately raised their arms towards Beijing, waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouting the Chinese they had just learned, "Long live Chairman Mao!" A black friend from Haiti, upon receiving the news of participating in the National Day celebration, was overjoyed. He eagerly and sincerely asked the translator to teach him two sentences that could best express his feelings. The translator enthusiastically taught him. He learned very seriously until late at night. The next day, he got up early, fearing he would forget, and stood alone in front of the colored portrait of Chairman Mao, shouting over and over again, "Mao—Zhu—Xi—Wan—Sui! Wish—Mao—Zhu—Xi—Wan—Shou—Wu—Jiang!" The happiest moment arrived. Chairman Mao came! As soon as he saw Chairman Mao, he was so happy that tears streamed down his face, and he kept shouting these two sentences that made him feel the happiest, the loudest, and the most affectionate.

"Long live Mao Zedong!" This is a word of respect. A driver from Mali is an illiterate, but he overcame great difficulties and, with the help of Chinese comrades, learned to write five beautiful Chinese characters full of respect: "Long live Chairman Mao." A blind person from Syria, with boundless admiration, asked his friend to take him to a portrait of Chairman Mao and describe the great image of Chairman Mao. He shouted as he listened, "China! Mao Zedong! Long live! Mao Zedong!" A friend from "Portuguese" Guinea traveled a long distance from his country to the capital of Mali, Bamako, and personally handed over a hanging tapestry woven by "Portuguese" Guinean women to the Chinese Embassy in Mali, solemnly requesting the Chinese friends to deliver this gift to Chairman Mao to "express the fighting 'Portuguese' Guinean people's boundless admiration for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao." On this tapestry, ten dazzling slogans were woven in French and Portuguese: "Long live Chairman Mao." A young artisan from Congo (Brazzaville) named Mugo spent three days and nights painting a three-foot-square portrait of Chairman Mao. On the right side of the portrait, he painted a red heart and a burning torch. He sent this painting to the Chinese Embassy. He said, "The red heart in the painting represents the Congolese (Brazzaville) people's heartfelt admiration for Chairman Mao, and the torch symbolizes the Congolese (Brazzaville) people's revolutionary will, burning like a flame under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to carry the revolution to the end!"

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. Thousands of words cannot express the world's people's love for you, and thousands of songs cannot sing out the world's people's deep affection for you. Every heartfelt wish and every passionate song of praise are condensed with the world's revolutionary people's gratitude, respect, faith, and love for you. The chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Comrade Hill, pointed out, "Today, revolutionary Marxism-Leninism shines with brilliant light. New fighters are emerging. A large number of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary organizations are forming. This is first and foremost thanks to the genius Mao Zedong." A fighter from Congo (Kinshasa) in battle, Salvador John, said that the great Chairman Mao is the symbol of liberation, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating the path to the complete liberation of the people of the world. An American youth wrote with passionate verses, "It is you, our commander, who gathered the people's ideals, wisdom, and strength into a vibrant ocean. It is you, our incomparable teacher, who pointed out the clear direction for us to change the world. Valleys, plains, mountains, and oceans will forever sing in praise of you. Long live Chairman Mao! Wish you a long life!"

    世界革命人民共祝毛主席万寿无疆
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大光辉普照全球。五大洲再广没有毛主席的智慧广，四大洋再深没有世界革命人民对毛主席的热爱深。全世界革命人民同声祝贺毛主席万寿无疆。这是世界各国人民最最衷心的祝愿。这一声祝愿蕴含着世界人民多少崇敬，多少信仰，多少热爱，多少希望，多少力量啊！
    一句祝愿就是一种最深厚的国际主义情谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民亲密的朋友霍查同志衷心祝愿毛泽东同志“象我们的高山一样长寿”，表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛主席最真挚的热爱。在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，连几岁的孩子见到毛主席像也会亲切地喊一声“毛泽东”这个最光辉的名字。阿尔巴尼亚一位手工业合作社的妇女热情地同即将回国的中国留学生一起绣一面献给毛主席的红旗，旗上绣着：“毛主席，祝您万寿无疆！”这位女工说：“我真想把阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛主席的无限热爱都绣在旗上！”
    一句祝愿就是一次崇高的战斗敬礼。战斗在反美前哨的一位越南战友写了一首热情洋溢的颂诗，敬祝毛主席“万寿无疆，光耀全球”。越南战友阮彬说出了越南人民万分感激毛主席和毛泽东思想的心里话：“毛泽东思想好象东方的太阳，照亮了我们的心，坚定了我们的革命思想和革命意志，为我们彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者、现代修正主义者的斗争，增添了战斗毅力。”无数封从南越寄给中国战友的“南方来信”，带来了越南南方人民爱戴毛主席的最深厚的革命感情。这些信常常辗转万里，历时数月以至一年以上，经过多少双热情的手，走过多少战斗的里程，才投递到中国同志的手里。来信说：“我们非常感谢毛主席的恩情！”“中国人民对越南人民的最大援助，就是毛主席的军事思想。”
    一句祝愿就是一首最美好的颂歌。一位英国青年给中国朋友寄来了一张贺年片。上面工工整整地写着：“今天是十二月二十六日，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这天晚上，一位在英国学习的巴基斯坦学生，将一张毛主席像挂在光芒四射的灯前。他意味深长地说：“这象征着毛主席给人民带来了光明。”保加利亚一个全家人都读毛主席的书的革命家庭，用千针万线绣了一块精致的台布和两块手帕，用千情万意写了一封最最衷心祝福毛主席的信，从遥远的地方寄给中国同志，请求将这些礼物“转给最敬爱的领袖毛主席”。初秋的一天，南斯拉夫一对失业工人夫妇手捧一盆“长青草”，送给中国朋友，表示对毛主席最最衷心的祝福。尼泊尔朋友觉西在一封“敬祝全世界最伟大、最杰出、最敬爱的主席——毛主席万寿无疆”的信中说：“天上有个红太阳，地上有个毛泽东；天上的太阳光芒万丈，地上的太阳普照四方。”一艘希腊籍货轮进入中国湛江港后，一位老海员一见到中国工作人员就竖起大拇指说：“毛主席真伟大！”他掏出一个绸布包，从里面拿出一枚红光闪闪的毛主席像章，紧握住中国朋友的手恳切地说，“请您转告中国人民，我们希腊人民和全世界人民都祝愿毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”一次，“马特罗卓沙”号轮船来到青岛港。一位外国海员一上岸就拿出一本《毛主席语录》对中国工作人员说：“对世界人民来说，最最重要的是这本宝书，这上面说的都是真理。”接着他翻开《毛主席语录》，高声朗读起来。在离开青岛那天，他斟满了一杯葡萄酒，面对着毛主席像，高高举起酒杯，无限深情地说：“衷心祝愿您万寿无疆！”
    一句祝愿就是一次巨大的鼓舞。各国革命人民把毛主席身体非常健康看作是世界人民最大的幸福，最大的喜悦。毛主席身体非常非常健康的喜讯传遍世界各地，给世界革命人民带来最大的鼓舞。喜讯传到战火纷飞的越南，一位越南战友瑛刚给中国同志来信说：“在反对凶恶的美国强盗的激烈战斗中，我也象全体越南人民一样，在听到这个消息时感到无限兴奋。因为这是正在战斗中的三千一百万越南人民以及全世界人民的最大幸福。”喜讯传到老挝山区，一位年已一百开外的苗族老太太高兴得用古老的民歌曲调唱了起来：“毛主席啊！中国升起的红太阳，永远照耀着老挝的大地！”喜讯传到日本，三位革命者联名给中国朋友来信说：“对世界无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族来说，毛主席的健康，比任何事情都值得高兴。这一喜讯增加了我们向美帝国主义进行斗争的勇气。”喜讯传到古巴，一对老人同声欢呼：“好！好！太好了！这可是天大的喜事呀！”喜讯传到马里留苏学生那里，一位马里留学生说：“这是最最使我得到鼓舞，最最使我感到高兴的消息。这是世界上最好的消息。”
    全世界革命人民在不同的地方，用不同的语言和不同的方式，最最热烈地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    “万岁，毛泽东！”这是战斗的誓言。“漫龄（万岁），毛泽东！”守卫在富科特山前线的老挝人民战士喊着它，投入战斗。“奥耶（万岁），毛泽东！”刚果（布）的青年们喊着它，面对一尊毛主席塑像举手致敬，表示革命决心。“乌拉（万岁），毛泽东！”一位苏联妇女喊着它，用手指着自己的胸口，对中国同志坚定地说：“他们（苏修）不让我们喊，我硬是要喊！永远喊！”“朗利夫（万岁），毛泽东！”美国的工人喊着它，同美国反动派展开斗争。
    “万岁，毛泽东！”这是力量的源泉。保加利亚农村一位老人把一幅毛主席的织锦像，放在一个镶着金边的镜框里，挂在房间最显著的地方。他每天都要敬仰一会毛主席像。他说：“因为我一看到毛主席像就感到全身都是力量，感到什么困难都可以克服。”波兰华沙一个中学的学生，在“造反有理”的精神鼓舞下，在一天夜里，将一张毛主席像贴在教室的正中央，两旁分别写着两条标语：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！”学校当局发现后，吓得魂不附体，立刻把毛主席像和标语拿下来，并威胁说：“今后再不准这样做。”但是，就在第二天，“毛主席万岁！”这几个光辉灿烂的大字又出现在教学楼的楼梯旁。中国海员曾接到印度革命者的一封从印度监狱里寄来的血书，血书上写着：“我们渴望得到一部世界上最宝贵的书——毛泽东的著作。伟大的毛泽东主席万岁！”伟大的毛泽东思想给狱中的印度革命者带来坚强的斗争意志和对胜利的坚定信心。每当反动派把他们打得遍体鳞伤的时候，他们就背诵毛主席的语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”在拉丁美洲一个丛山密林里，一位人民游击战士，屹立在晨雾萦绕的高山上，无限深情地眺望着东方，等待着太阳的升起。他一手紧握着在一次战斗中从敌人手里夺来的枪，一手挥动着一本红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》。他翻开了第一页的画面，“毛泽东！”他喊出了声，他昂起了头。东方的太阳升起来了，升起来了！那炽烈的阳光赶走了大西洋海面的云雾，透过密林的树梢，射到了战士的脸上，他们生气勃勃地迎着东方红日，欢呼着“万岁”，迎接着新的战斗。
    “万岁，毛泽东！”这是胜利的信念。印尼的一些革命者每当得到革命的宝书《毛主席语录》时，便热烈高呼这蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量的口号。他们坚定地说：“毛主席教导我们：星星之火，可以燎原’。毛泽东的道路是印尼人民解放的唯一道路！我们的处于水深火热之中的亲人一定会解放！”瑞士一位贫苦的老工人，见到一幅毛主席像便恭恭敬敬地行了一个鞠躬礼。“万岁，毛主席！”他情不自禁地高呼起来。他说：“毛主席是真理的化身，工人的救命恩人。”他和他老伴天天收听北京电台的广播，有时一天听两三次，数年如一日。他说：“每当在收音机里听到毛主席的名字时，我们全家都感到很幸福。”
    “万岁，毛泽东！”这是幸福的欢呼。一天深夜，停泊在中国港口的塞浦路斯籍“安格里奇”号轮船的一个加油工人，忽然从床上爬了起来，轻轻地走到中国执勤人员面前，恳求中国朋友教他用中文读和写“毛主席万岁”这五个闪闪发光的大字。他说：“这句话是全世界人民的心声。我一定要学会！”后来，他终于会读会写了。因此，他经常竖起大拇指用中国话骄傲地高呼这个口号。去年五月，“伏伦娜”号轮船由达累斯萨拉姆刚到青岛，一些外国海员们便朝着北京的方向，高举手臂，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼刚刚学会的中国话：“毛主席万岁！”一位从海地来中国的黑人朋友，接到参加国庆观礼的喜讯后，高兴极了。他迫不及待地、非常恳切地要翻译同志教他喊两句最最能表达他心意的中国话。翻译同志就很热情地教他。他很认真地学，直到深夜，终于学会了。第二天，他怕忘了，一大早就起了床，独自一人站在毛主席彩色画像前一次又一次地高呼：“毛—主—席—万—岁！祝—毛—主—席—万—寿—无—疆！”最幸福的时刻到来了。毛主席来了！他一看见毛主席，就高兴得热泪直往外淌，不停地高呼这两句最使他感到幸福的、最最响亮、最最亲切的口号。
    “万岁，毛泽东！”这是敬爱的赞词。马里一位司机是个一字不识的文盲，但是他克服了极大的困难，在中国同志的帮助下，学会流利地写出五个漂亮的满含敬意的汉字：“毛主席万岁”。叙利亚一位盲人怀着无限景仰的心情，请他的朋友把他带到一幅毛主席像前，给他描述毛主席的伟大形象。他边听，边欢呼：“中国！毛泽东！万岁！毛泽东！”一位“葡属”几内亚朋友从国内长途跋涉来到马里首都巴马科，把“葡属”几内亚妇女织的一条挂毡亲自交给中国驻马里大使馆，郑重地请求中国朋友把这份礼物转交给毛主席，以“表达战斗中的‘葡属’几内亚人民对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的无比爱戴”。在这条挂毡上用法文和葡萄牙文织了十六句灿烂夺目的口号：“毛主席万岁”。一位名叫姆戈戈的刚果（布）青年手工艺工人，花了三天三夜工夫，画了一张三尺见方的大幅毛主席像。在像的右边，画了一颗红心和一个熊熊燃烧的火把。他把这幅画送给了中国大使馆。他说：“画中的红心，代表刚果（布）人民对毛主席的衷心爱戴，火把象征刚果（布）人民在毛泽东思想指引下革命意志象烈火般在熊熊燃烧，决心把革命进行到底！”
    亲爱的毛主席啊，您是世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。千言万语讲不完世界人民对您的热爱，千歌万曲唱不尽世界人民对您的深情。一句句语重心长的祝愿，一首首热情奔放的颂歌，都凝结着世界革命人民对您的感激，对您的崇敬，对您的信仰。澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔同志指出：“今天革命的马克思列宁主义发射出灿烂的光辉。新的战士正在涌现。一大批马克思列宁主义的革命组织正在形成。这首先应该感谢天才的毛泽东。”战斗中的刚果（金）的一位战士萨尔瓦多·约翰说，伟大的毛主席是解放的象征，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是照亮世界人民彻底解放的道路的灯塔。美国一位青年用热情洋溢的诗句写道：“是您，我们的统帅，把群众的理想、智慧和力量，汇集成生气蓬勃的海洋。是您，我们无可比拟的导师，为我们改造世界指出了明确的方向。溪谷、原野、群山、海洋，将永远为颂扬您而歌唱。万岁，毛主席！祝您万寿无疆！”
