The people of Henan Province, numbering 50 million, warmly celebrate the birth of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and enthusiastically hail the new victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres have, on this grand occasion, made ironclad pledges to Chairman Mao: to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to launch a more extensive and in-depth campaign of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, to implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve new victories in the great struggle for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains to the plains of eastern Henan, from the banks of the Yellow River to the shores of the Huai River, the vast land of Central China is a sea of red flags and thunderous songs. Revolutionary committees and broad masses of revolutionaries in various places have held celebratory meetings and carried out various forms of celebratory activities. The people of Henan Province, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, have condensed their countless words into one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Their countless songs have been condensed into one wish: "May Chairman Mao live ten thousand years! May he live ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

In the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, these days are filled with the sound of firecrackers and drums. Many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have taken to the streets, spreading the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the new victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the broad revolutionary masses. Many grassroots units, inspired by this great victory, have quickly achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, rushing to report their joy to the provincial revolutionary committee. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Qiliping People's Commune in Xinxiang County have further implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the masses to launch a "people's war" to surround and annihilate factionalism throughout the commune, carried out work to support the army and care for military families, and done a good job in winter production to strive for new victories in the revolution and production in 1968. The news reached Lankao County, where Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, had fought, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely excited, saying that the establishment of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of Henan Province have deeply felt from their own revolutionary struggles that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. On the day of celebrating the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee, they regard the implementation and full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the most important and fundamental task. The revolutionary workers of the Zhengzhou Railway System, with its glorious revolutionary tradition of "February 7th," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and have brought about a new situation in railway transportation. The broad revolutionary workers of the coal base of Jiaozuo City in Henan Province have celebrated the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee with practical actions. They have launched a high-yield week for coal production, significantly increasing coal output. At present, the people of the entire province are full of revolutionary enthusiasm, striving to achieve more, and advancing with the momentum of victory. They are determined to turn Henan Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, letting the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of Henan.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 30th. The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Henan, who have made significant contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Henan Province, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and have held meetings and parades to warmly celebrate the birth of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary cadres and masses of Henan Province, and to make new contributions to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution.

On the morning of the 28th, the Henan Military Region and the broad cadres and soldiers of the stationed troops, carrying red flags and red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marched from various camps and sentry posts to the provincial revolutionary committee to congratulate them. With hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they presented the provincial revolutionary committee with letters of congratulation, good news reports, and a large color portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. The cadres and soldiers shouted thousands of times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "May Chairman Mao live ten thousand years! May he live ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The cadres and soldiers of the 7113th Unit executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in Zhengzhou City, on the day of celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, spent two days and two nights carefully making two color embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao. They put them in frames with the words "Revolutionary Committee is good" written on them and, with drums and gongs, presented them to the provincial revolutionary committee.

In recent days, various units of the troops stationed in Henan Province, from the camps to the "three supports and two militaries" front lines, have held lively discussions and firmly expressed their determination to support and defend the newly born revolutionary committee with practical actions.

The broad revolutionary cadres of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, with deep feelings of love for Chairman Mao, have, under the great encouragement of the Cultural Revolution, successfully developed and mass-produced offset printing machines for printing color portraits of Chairman Mao in just one month.
