The latest instructions from Chairman Mao must be fully implemented. All revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau Beijing Electrical Section Miyun Electrical Work Unit must ensure that every directive from Chairman Mao is carried out to the letter.

The New Year's editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily convey Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. This is a new battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We, the working class, must study it seriously, understand it deeply, and execute it faithfully, word for word.

Looking back at the past year, every achievement, every progress, and every victory we have made is due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is the result of our serious study, deep understanding, and faithful execution of Chairman Mao's instructions.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a crucial step is to strengthen proletarian party spirit and eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

The New Year's editorial points out: "The ability to consciously overcome factionalism is a crucial indicator of whether one is genuinely a revolutionary in the new situation." From our experience over the past year, we deeply feel that if factionalism exists, one will adopt a wrong utilitarian attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, picking and choosing during study, using it to wage endless "internal wars." If factionalism exists, one will say one thing in front and do another behind, saying one thing to others and doing another themselves. In short, with factionalism, we cannot truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, will deviate from the direction of the struggle, and the revolution will not develop. We have a deep understanding of this.

In September last year, our unit achieved revolutionary great unity, and everyone consciously overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. As a result, various situations have changed significantly. Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "grasp the revolution, promote production" and "correctly handle cadres" were quickly implemented. The revolution and production have flourished, and the revolutionary great unity has been consolidated in thought, achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

We are determined, in the new year, to vigorously organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, to deeply study and apply the "Old Five Articles," to thoroughly criticize the "private" and establish the "public," to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented. We will strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛主席最新指示要条条落实

    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论，传达了毛主席的伟大战略部署，它是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部向我们发出的新的战斗号令，我们工人阶级一定要认真学习，深刻领会，字字执行，句句照办。
    回顾过去一年来，我们所取得的每一点成绩，每一项进步，每一个胜利，都是依靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，都是对毛主席的指示认真学习，深刻领会，条条落实，句句照办的结果。
    要使毛主席的最新指示全面落实，很重要的一条，就是要加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性。
    元旦社论中指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”我们从一年多来的实践中，深深地体会到，如果有了派性，对毛泽东思想就会采取十分错误的实用主义态度，学习时就会断章取义，各取所需，用来无休止地打“内战”；如果有派性存在，就会当面一套，背后一套，对别人说的是一套，自己做的则又是一套。总之，有派性存在，我们就不能真正地掌握毛泽东思想，就会背离斗争的大方向，革命也就不能发展。我们对这一点是深有体会的。
    去年九月，我们单位实现了革命的大联合，大家自觉地去克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。这样，各方面的情况就发生了显著的变化，毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”和“正确地对待干部”等最新指示，就很快地得到了贯彻执行，革命和生产蒸蒸日上，并且从思想上巩固了革命的大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”。
    我们决心在新的一年里，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，大学大用“老五篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，保证毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
