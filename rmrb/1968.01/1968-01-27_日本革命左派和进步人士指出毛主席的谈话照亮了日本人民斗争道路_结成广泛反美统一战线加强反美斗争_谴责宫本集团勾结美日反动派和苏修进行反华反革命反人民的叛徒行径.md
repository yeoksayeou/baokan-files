Tokyo, January 26 (Xinhua) — Japanese revolutionary leftists and progressive friends from various circles recently issued statements warmly hailing the fourth anniversary of the publication of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism" (January 27). They pointed out that Chairman Mao's speech has illuminated the path of struggle for the Japanese people. They resolutely declared that they will join the Japanese people and the people of the world to fight bravely for the victory of the anti-U.S. struggle, and severely condemn the traitorous actions of the Komoto Revisionist Group in sabotaging the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Japanese people.

The chairman of the General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Kurosawa Toshio, emphasized the great significance of Chairman Mao's speech. He said: "As Chairman Mao said, the Japanese people should expand the anti-U.S. patriotic united front at home and, internationally, unite with all peoples oppressed and enslaved by U.S. imperialism to form a broad international anti-U.S. united front and fight together."

Kurosawa said that the Japanese people will never allow the Japanese Sato government to realize its ambition of invading China again. He said that the recent fierce struggle of the Japanese people against the docking of U.S. nuclear warships has demonstrated the great power of the Japanese people. Kurosawa also severely condemned the anti-China, counter-revolutionary, and anti-people traitorous actions of the Komoto Revisionist Group. He pointed out that it is only natural that the peasants expelled them from their ranks in the recent struggles against U.S. military bases in Sanrizuka, Sunagawa, and Kita-Fuji.

Japanese revolutionary leftist Yasui Koji pointed out that the recent developments in the domestic and international situation in Japan have completely proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's speech. He said: "U.S. imperialism is terrified by the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, is at its wits' end after being beaten by the armed forces of the Vietnamese people, and the armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also made it tremble with fear. In this situation, U.S. imperialism is instructing the Japanese reactionaries to tightly bind Japan to its war chariot of aggression. The aggression, oppression, and control of U.S. imperialism over Japan have brought great suffering to the workers, peasants, students, and people of all strata in Japan. Now is the time for the Japanese people to direct the spearhead of their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Japanese reactionaries, and resolutely launch an anti-U.S. patriotic struggle."

Yasui emphasized: "U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries are facing major crises both politically and economically. The Japanese people, with the working class at the forefront, must be prepared for battle and welcome the coming of the stormy era."

The executive director of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Hagiwara Sadashi, said: "The correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment in this speech that 'U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people' has been fully proven in our struggle practice." Hagiwara pointed out that U.S. imperialism will collude with the Sato reactionary government, the Soviet revisionists, and the Japanese revisionist group to further intensify their anti-China actions. We must strengthen and expand the unity of the Japan-China friendship trade circles and resolutely smash the enemy's attacks.

Famous philosopher Matsumura Kazuhito emphasized that Chairman Mao pointed out in this speech that the continuous expansion of the anti-U.S. patriotic united front of the Japanese people is of great significance.

Matsumura exposed the deceptive nature of the so-called "united front" often advocated by the Komoto Revisionist Group. He pointed out: Their so-called "united front" is an attempt to lead the people away from the revolutionary united front.

Matsumura strongly condemned the Komoto Revisionist Group for colluding with the Soviet modern revisionist group, the biggest accomplice of U.S. imperialism, to form an anti-China, counter-revolutionary "united front."

Matsumura emphasized that if we do not thoroughly expose the ugly face of the Komoto Revisionist Group, which has degenerated into a running dog of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries, we cannot form a genuine revolutionary united front, nor can we achieve the true liberation of the Japanese people.

The secretary-general of the Hyogo Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Nakajima Masao, said: "At a time when the anti-U.S. struggle of the Japanese people is surging, we need to re-study Chairman Mao's speech and implement it in action. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, victory will be ours."

The secretary-general of the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Socialist Party, Sugiyama Atsuo, said that following Chairman Mao's teachings, we should distinguish between friends and enemies, form the broadest anti-U.S. patriotic united front, and launch a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries. In this way, we will definitely drive out U.S. imperialism and build a truly independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral new Japan. Sugiyama said: "For the Japanese people's revolution, strengthening the unity between the peoples of Japan and China is an extremely important strategic issue." "The Komoto Revisionist Group, which has betrayed the people and the revolution and fiercely attacks Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, is the enemy of the people and the enemy of the revolution. To form a broad anti-U.S. patriotic united front, we must thoroughly expose their nature and smash their plots."

The secretary-general of the revolutionary theater group Kokuritsu, Higasa Seiki, said that all members of Kokuritsu, through more than a year of personal experience, have come to recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times.

He expressed: All members of Kokuritsu will in the future strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, and wage a more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government, smashing all the plots of the Komoto Revisionist Group.

    日本革命左派和进步人士指出毛主席的谈话照亮了日本人民斗争道路
    结成广泛反美统一战线加强反美斗争
    谴责宫本集团勾结美日反动派和苏修进行反华反革命反人民的叛徒行径
    新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：日本革命左派和各界进步朋友最近发表谈话，热烈欢呼世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表四周年（一月二十七日）。他们指出，毛主席的这次谈话照亮了日本人民斗争的道路。他们坚决表示，要同日本人民和世界人民一起，为争取反美斗争的胜利而英勇战斗，并且严正谴责宫本修正主义集团破坏日本人民反美爱国斗争的叛徒行径。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部会长黑田寿男强调指出毛主席这次谈话的伟大意义。他说：“正如毛主席所说，日本人民在国内应当扩大反美爱国统一战线，在国际上要联合一切被美帝国主义压迫和奴役的人民，结成广泛的国际反美统一战线，共同战斗。”
    黑田说，日本人民绝不容许日本佐藤政府妄图再次侵略中国的野心得逞。他说，最近日本人民反对美国核舰只停泊的激烈斗争，显示了日本人民的强大力量。黑田还严正谴责宫本修正主义集团的反华、反革命、反人民的叛徒行径。他指出，最近在三里塚、砂川和北富士的反对美军基地的斗争中，农民把他们从自己的队伍中清除出去，是理所当然的。
    日本革命左派安斋库治指出，最近日本国内外形势的发展，完全证明了毛主席这次谈话的正确性。他说：“美帝国主义被中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利吓得要死，被越南人民武装力量打得走投无路，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的武装斗争，也使它胆战心惊。在这种情况下，美帝国主义就指使日本反动派把日本牢牢地绑在它的侵略的战车上。美帝国主义对日本的侵略、压迫和控制，使日本的工人、农民、学生以及日本各阶层的人民蒙受了极大的苦难。现在是日本人民把斗争的锋芒对准美帝国主义及其走狗日本反动派，坚决开展反美爱国斗争的时候了。”
    安斋强调说：“美帝国主义和日本反动派不论在政治上、经济上都面临着重大的危机。以工人阶级为先锋的日本人民，要做好战斗的准备，迎接暴风雨时代的来临。”
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事萩原定司说：“毛主席在这个谈话中关于‘美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人’这个论断的正确性，已经完全在我们的斗争实践中证明了。”萩原指出，美帝国主义今后会同佐藤反动政府、苏修、日修集团加紧勾结，进一步反华。我们要加强和扩大日中友好贸易界的团结，坚决粉碎敌人的进攻。
    著名哲学家松村一人强调说，毛主席在这次谈话中指出日本人民反美爱国统一战线不断地扩大，这有着十分重要的意义。
    松村揭露了宫本修正主义集团经常宣扬的所谓“统一战线”的欺骗性。他指出：他们所说的
  “统一战线”，是企图引导人民脱离革命的统一战线。
    松村强烈谴责宫本修正主义集团勾结美帝国主义最大的帮凶苏联现代修正主义集团，结成了反华、反革命的“统一战线”。
    松村强调说，我们如果不彻底揭露已经堕落成为美日反动派走狗的宫本修正主义集团的丑恶面目，就不能结成一个真正的革命的统一战线，也不能取得日本人民的真正的解放。
    日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部事务局长中岛正夫说：“在日本人民反美斗争日益高涨的今天，我们有必要重新学习毛主席的这一谈话，并且贯彻到行动中去。在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，胜利是属于我们的。”
    社会党山口县总部书记长杉山敦男说，遵循毛主席的教导，我们应当分清谁是朋友，谁是敌人，结成最广泛的反美爱国统一战线，向美帝国主义和反动派展开坚决的斗争。这样，我们就一定能够赶走美帝国主义，建立一个真正独立、民主、和平、中立的新日本。杉山说：“对于日本人民革命来说，加强日中两国人民的团结是极其重要的具有战略意义的问题。”“背叛人民背叛革命、疯狂攻击毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的宫本修正主义集团，是人民的敌人，革命的敌人。为了结成广泛的反美爱国统一战线，必须彻底揭露他们这种本质，粉碎他们的阴谋。”
    日本革命剧团齿轮座干事长日笠世志久说，齿轮座的全体团员通过一年多的亲身体验，更加认识到毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    他表示：齿轮座的全体团员今后要更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，向美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府进行更坚决的斗争，粉碎宫本修正主义集团的一切阴谋。
