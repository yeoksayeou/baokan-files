	Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary leftists of Chiba Prefecture, Japan, have resolutely opposed the Gombun revisionist group. On December 5, 1967, the Japanese Communist Party Chiba Prefecture Committee (Left) was formally established.

	In a statement, the JCP Chiba Prefecture Committee (Left) expressed its determination to join hands with the revolutionary leftists across Japan, to actively study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against American imperialism, Japanese monopoly capital, and revisionism, and to strive for the great cause of the Japanese revolution.

	The statement emphasized: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time. He has defended and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought has become the beacon guiding the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of the world. Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought for the liberation and revolution of Japan has become an important mass task."

	The statement pointed out that in the contemporary world, recognizing or not recognizing Mao Zedong Thought, and supporting or not supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is the touchstone for distinguishing true Marxist-Leninists from false ones.

	The statement condemned the Gombun revisionist group for its international stance of "lowering the U.S., uniting with the Soviet Union, and opposing China," and its domestic line of "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition," as well as its crimes of disrupting the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. It stated that the Gombun group has completely stood on the opposing side of the Japanese proletariat and the people. The historical judgment of the Gombun revisionist group is being carried out among the people nationwide. The struggle of the Japanese revolutionary leftists to overthrow the Gombun revisionist group is unstoppable. The Gombun revisionist group is bound to fail.

	The statement called out: "Down with American imperialism, Japanese monopoly capital, Soviet modern revisionism, and its followers, the Gombun revisionist group! Long live the unity of all revolutionary leftists in Japan based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the unity of the proletarians of the world!"

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗大造宫本集团的反
    日共千叶县委员会（左派）宣告成立
    新华社东京二日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，日本千叶县革命左派大造宫本修正主义集团的反，在一九六七年十二月五日宣告正式成立日本共产党千叶县委员会（左派）。
    日共千叶县委员会（左派）在一项声明中表示要同日本全国革命左派紧密地携起手来，在反对美帝国主义、日本垄断资本和修正主义的斗争中，积极地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，为完成日本革命的伟大事业而奋斗。
    声明强调指出：“毛泽东同志是当代的列宁。他捍卫并且创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想已经成为指导亚非拉以及全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民进行革命斗争的指路明灯。为了日本的解放和革命而学习和运用毛泽东思想已经成为重要的群众性的任务。”
    声明指出，在当代，承认不承认毛泽东思想，拥护不拥护毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命是区别真假马克思列宁主义者的试金石。
    声明谴责宫本修正主义集团在国际上降美、联苏、反华，在国内推行“议会道路”和“和平过渡”的修正主义路线，以及破坏日本人民的反美爱国斗争的罪行后指出，宫本集团已完全站在日本无产阶级和人民的敌对方面了。对宫本修正主义集团进行历史性的审判，正在全国群众中展开。日本革命左派打倒宫本修正主义集团的斗争，是任何人也阻挡不了的。宫本修正主义集团必定要失败。
    声明高呼：“打倒美帝国主义、日本垄断资本、苏联现代修正主义及其追随者宫本修正主义集团！”“日本一切革命左派以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为基础的团结万岁！”“全世界无产者联合起来！”
