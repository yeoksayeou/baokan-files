A nine-year-old girl student from the Xam Neua Liberation Zone in Laos has a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao hanging above her bed. She enthusiastically told her teacher, "I hang Chairman Mao's portrait above my bed because I want to see Uncle Mao every day." She added, "I will definitely follow Uncle Mao's words."

Now, the children in this liberation zone almost all know how to sing "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Tiller" and many other songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations.

    心向毛主席
    我天天都要看看毛伯伯
    老挝川圹解放区一个九岁的女学生，在床头挂着一张彩色的毛主席像。她热情地告诉教师：“我把毛主席像挂在床头上，是因为我天天都要看看毛伯伯。”她又说：“我一定听毛伯伯的话。”
    现在这个解放区的孩子们差不多都会唱《大海航行靠舵手》和好多首毛主席语录歌。
