Under the brutal exploitation and oppression of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, the Indian people are suffering from hunger and misery. Currently, 200 million Indians are long-term malnourished, and 80 percent of infants suffer from "nutritional marasmus."

This is the dark reality of India revealed recently by a reporter from the British bourgeois newspaper *Sunday Mirror*.

The reporter said: "I was asked to investigate some relief work. I saw elderly people in Gaya Station, Bihar, waiting every day for bags of grain to be transported, hoping that a little grain would fall out of these bags, so they could gather it up for a meal. Even this would take three days.

"I saw in Palamau a mother begging for more food because she was holding a child on the verge of death. A worker from the Oxfam relief agency said, 'When I see their emaciated arms and legs, I can hardly believe that any of them are still alive.'"

The reporter said: "The villages I saw had houses on the verge of collapse. I saw women squatting in the fields from dawn to the hot noon, digging up grass and tender shoots for their livestock. I saw children crawling on the ground looking for grass to eat. I saw vultures circling in the sky every day. They are waiting...

"This is the scene in Bihar."

The reporter also said: "Among 500 million Indians, 200 million people are long-term malnourished. The sight of starving children is something one cannot easily forget... Dirty skin, swollen bellies, hair that should be black but has turned white and sparse. Many children have eye and ear diseases. A government investigation team in Hyderabad estimated that 80 percent of children under five in India are still suffering from 'nutritional marasmus.' This has a very bad effect on the body. But now, increasing signs indicate that the lack of food also affects intelligence. It harms the brain. This is the worst vicious cycle."

    在美帝苏修和印度反动派残酷剥削压迫下
    印度两亿人长期挨饿苦难深重
    新华社伦敦电　在美帝、苏修和印度反动派的残酷剥削和压迫下的印度人民，处在饥饿的苦难之中。现在，印度有二亿人长期吃不饱，百分之八十的幼儿患“营养不良萎缩症”。
    这是英国资产阶级报纸《星期日镜报》的记者不久前在这家报纸上透露的印度的黑暗的现状。
    这个记者说：“我被要求去了解一些救济工作的情况。我看见居住在比哈尔邦伽耶车站的老年人每天在等待着运输谷物的口袋，希望有少量的谷物会从这些口袋中漏出来，他们就可以把它们括集起来充当一餐，即使这样要花费三天的时间。
      “我在帕拉毛看到一位母亲在乞求较多一些的食物，因为她胸前抱着一个濒临死亡的孩子。一位奥克斯范救济所的工作人员说，‘当我看见他们的骨瘦如柴的手臂和腿时，我简直不能相信他们之中有谁还活着。’”
    这个记者说：“我看到的村庄土房都快倒塌了。我看到妇女们从凌晨到火热的中午一直蹲在地里为家畜挖掘青草嫩苗。我看到孩子们在地上爬来爬去寻找青草吃。我看到每天都能看到的兀鹰盘旋在天空中的景象。它们等待着……
      “这就是比哈尔（邦）的景象。”
    这个记者还说：“在五亿印度人中，有二亿人长期营养不足。孩子们挨饿的景象是一个人难以遗忘的……污垢的皮肤，鼓胀的肚子，应该是漆黑的头发已变白，疏稀脱落。许多孩子都有着眼疾和耳疾。一个在海得拉巴的政府调查队估计，在印度五岁以下的小孩，有百分之八十还在受着‘营养不良的萎缩症’的折磨。这对身体有极坏的影响。但现在不断增加的迹象表明，食物的缺乏同样对智力也有影响。它有害于大脑。这是最糟糕的恶性循环。”
