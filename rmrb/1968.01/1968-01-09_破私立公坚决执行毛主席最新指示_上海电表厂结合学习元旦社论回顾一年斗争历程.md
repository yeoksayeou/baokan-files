Shanghai Electric Meter Factory Combines Study of New Year's Editorial with Review of One Year's Struggle

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 8th: The struggle practice of Shanghai Electric Meter Factory over the past year has proven: actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and strictly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is the key to victory.

The revolutionary workers of this factory have gone through a process of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, from unconsciousness to consciousness. For a period, the two revolutionary mass organizations in the factory fought "internal wars" for their own interests.

At this time, the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the factory, timely giving guidance lectures on studying Chairman Mao's works, and seriously pointing out to them: whether or not to truly listen to Chairman Mao's words is the touchstone to distinguish true revolutionaries from false ones. Some people say they listen to Chairman Mao's words, but in actual actions, they cannot truly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, which means they are not genuine proletarian revolutionaries, but verbal revolutionaries. The words of the PLA had a great impact on the revolutionary masses of the entire factory. The two revolutionary organizations reviewed the situation of the previous period of "internal war," using the "Three Articles" as weapons, deeply reflecting on their souls, overcoming factionalism, making more self-criticisms, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

After achieving great unity, the issue of implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination was put on the agenda. To implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the first step is to do a good job of liberating cadres. However, the two factions had disagreements on the cadre issue in the past. To eliminate these disagreements, Mao Zedong Thought must be used to unify understanding. The proletarian revolutionaries of this factory organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the latest instructions on correctly handling cadres. After unifying their ideological understanding, they allowed cadres to examine their mistakes, helping cadres who made mistakes to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, liberating a large number of cadres, and quickly establishing a revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organ.

The victory of revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination made them further understand that: following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory. Therefore, they implemented Chairman Mao's instructions more resolutely, truly acting according to the instructions, understanding them resolutely and implementing them, even if they temporarily do not understand them, they implement them resolutely and deepen their understanding in the process of implementation. After Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions were issued during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China regions, they immediately used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement, took practical measures, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and pushed the cultural revolution of the entire factory to a new stage.

The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of this factory have increasingly deeply realized through struggle practice that actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is a process of breaking with self and establishing a public mindset, and transforming one's worldview. Only by studying and applying the "Three Articles" in struggle, fiercely fighting against the bourgeois "self," and firmly establishing the proletarian "public," can one consciously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the entire factory launched a vigorous campaign of studying, applying, discussing, and reciting the "Three Articles." Since last October, from the factory department to the workshops and offices, layer by layer, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held, using the "Three Articles" as weapons, carrying out mass campaigns of fighting against self and criticizing revisionism. Through study, the broad revolutionary masses' consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions was greatly enhanced, and the entire factory saw many vivid examples of breaking with self and establishing a public mindset. Hu Hanchang, a member of the revolutionary committee of this factory, was one of the first batch of revolutionaries who participated in the "Workers' General Headquarters." During the intense "internal war" between the two revolutionary organizations in the factory, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, prioritized the overall situation, and first stopped the "internal war" in his own workshop, reaching an agreement on revolutionary great unity with the brother organizations, which played a significant role in promoting revolutionary great unity in the entire factory. However, when the factory established a unified revolutionary mass organization—"August 18th Red Rebel Corps," he was not elected as a core leader of the corps. Facing this issue, Hu Hanchang did not seek personal gain or grumble, but instead, he was very happy that the revolutionary great unity of the entire factory's revolutionaries was realized, and his work became more active and enthusiastic than before. Later, he was elected as a member of the factory revolutionary committee and continued to use the "Three Articles" to urge himself, being humble and cautious, not arrogant or impatient, often going deep into the masses, and receiving good evaluations from the masses. There are many such examples in the factory.

Recently, the proletarian revolutionaries of this factory, while studying the New Year's editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* for 1968, reviewed their one-year battle journey and decided to launch a more extensive and in-depth campaign of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the new year, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

### 破私立公坚决执行毛主席最新指示  上海电表厂结合学习元旦社论回顾一年斗争历程

    破私立公坚决执行毛主席最新指示
    上海电表厂结合学习元旦社论回顾一年斗争历程
    据新华社上海八日电  上海电表厂一年来的斗争实践证明：活学活用毛泽东思想，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，就是胜利。
    这个厂的革命职工学好用好毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，经历了一个从不自觉到自觉的过程。有一段时间，这个厂的两派革命群众组织为了各自小山头的利益，互相打“内战”。
    这时，解放军派来的毛泽东思想宣传队到了厂里，及时地对两派革命群众作了学习毛主席著作的辅导报告，并且严肃地向他们指出：是不是真正听毛主席的话，这是区别真革命还是假革命的试金石。有的人口头上说听毛主席的话，而在实际行动上却不能真正按毛主席的指示办事，这就称不上无产阶级革命派，而是口头革命派。解放军的话，使全厂革命群众受到很大震动。两派革命组织回顾了前一时期打“内战”的情况，以“老三篇”为武器，狠触灵魂，克服派性，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异，迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    大联合以后，实现革命三结合的问题就提到了议事日程上来。实现革命三结合，首先要做好解放干部的工作。但过去两派群众在干部问题上有分歧，要消除分歧，就必须用毛泽东思想来统一认识。这个厂的无产阶级革命派就组织大家认真学习毛主席的干部政策和有关正确对待干部的最新指示。在思想认识统一以后，让干部检查错误，帮助犯错误的干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来，解放了大批干部，很快建立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构。
    革命的大联合、三结合的胜利实现，使他们进一步懂得了：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是胜利，因此他们对毛主席的指示就贯彻得更坚决了，真正做到闻风而动，雷厉风行，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的极为重要的最新指示下达后，他们立即以毛主席的最新指示为武器，总结了前一阶段运动的经验和教训，采取切实的措施，落实毛主席的最新指示，把全厂的文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。
    这家工厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众从斗争实践中，越来越深刻地认识到活学活用毛泽东思想，贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，是一个破私立公、改造世界观的过程。只有在斗争中大学大用“老三篇”，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，才能自觉地执行毛主席的最新指示。在实现了革命大联合和革命三结合以后，全厂就展开了热火朝天的大学、大用、大讲、大背“老三篇”的活动。全厂从去年十月份以来，从厂部到车间科室，层层举办了毛泽东思想学习班，以“老三篇”为武器，开展了群众性的斗私批修活动。通过学习，大大提高了广大革命群众执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性，全厂出现了许多破私立公的生动事例。这个厂的革命委员会委员胡汉章，是全厂第一批参加“工总司”的革命派战士，当初在厂内两派革命组织“内战”激烈的时候，他按照毛主席的教导，以全局为重，在自己所在的车间里带动战友们首先停止“内战”，和兄弟组织达成革命大联合的协议，对促进全厂的革命大联合起了很大的作用。但是，当厂里成立统一的革命群众组织——“八一八”红色造反兵团时，他却没有被推选为兵团的领导核心。面对这个问题，胡汉章丝毫没有从个人利益出发去争席位，闹情绪，相反，他为全厂革命派实现了革命大联合而感到十分高兴，工作比以往更积极、更热情了。后来，他被选上了厂革命委员会的委员，仍然时时刻刻用“老三篇”来鞭策自己，谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，经常深入群众，得到了群众的好评。这样的事例在厂里还有很多。
    最近，这个厂的无产阶级革命派在学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论时，回顾了一年来的战斗历程，决心在新的一年里，在全厂更加广泛、深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
