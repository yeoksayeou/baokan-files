Chairman Mao says: "Correctly handling cadres is the key to implementing the revolutionary tripartite alliance, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit. This key issue must be resolved." While bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the stumbling block and obstacle to resolving this key issue.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the "capitalist roader" hidden deep in our souls, a venomous snake. Once infected by factionalism, one cannot correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, often judging and evaluating cadres from the standpoint of factionalism. For a period, the two revolutionary mass organizations in our factory, influenced by anarchist thoughts in society and their own bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, also engaged in some factionalist actions regarding cadres. Anyone who supported our faction was indiscriminately deemed a "good cadre," protected and released without distinction; anyone who disagreed with our organization's views was labeled a "capitalist roader" or "monster and demon," subjected to struggle and overthrow. If you say he is a "good cadre," I will insist on persecuting him, determined to label him a "capitalist roader" or "monster and demon." As a result, the real capitalist roaders and monsters and demons went unpunished, while our comrades and revolutionary cadres were fought against relentlessly. In reality, this confused the enemy lines, shielded the class enemy, and prevented some cadres who should have been liberated from coming forward.

Later, with the help of the supporting and left-leaning PLA stationed in our factory, we established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we realized: in handling cadres, we cannot use factionalism as the criterion but must stand on the party's standpoint, primarily looking at the cadre's attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao says: "Not only should we look at a cadre's actions and words at a particular time, but also at the cadre's entire history and work." We firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction, conducted a class analysis of several cadres in the factory. Those who should be liberated were liberated, and those who should be overthrown were overthrown. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, regardless of whether they support us, we must ruthlessly overthrow; anyone who is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, even if they do not support us at the moment, we must resolutely protect. Even cadres who have made mistakes, we help them correct their shortcomings and mistakes according to the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," with great enthusiasm, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The New Year's editorial points out: "Whether one can consciously overcome factionalism is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a genuine proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." The practice of the Cultural Revolution over more than a year has proven that in units where cadres are correctly handled from the standpoint of the party and the people, cadres are liberated early, quickly, and well, the Cultural Revolution progresses rapidly, the revolutionary great alliance is consolidated, and the revolutionary "tripartite alliance" leadership is established quickly. Conversely, in units where mass organizations handle cadres from the standpoint of factionalism, cadres cannot be truly liberated, the Cultural Revolution progresses slowly, and the revolutionary great alliance cannot be consolidated and developed.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, we must not be fooled by the class enemy again. We must unite, thoroughly defeat factionalism, and expose it for what it is. According to Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, we must boldly liberate and use cadres, contributing all our efforts to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    彻底打倒派性　正确对待干部
    安徽淮南制盒印刷厂工人　詹孝丽
    毛主席说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”而资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，则是解决这个关键问题的拦路虎和绊脚石。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是隐藏在我们灵魂深处的“走资派”，是条大毒蛇。中了派性的毒，就不能正确地执行毛主席的干部政策，往往是站在派性的立场上去鉴别和衡量干部。有一段时间，我们厂里的两派革命群众组织，由于受社会上无政府主义思想的影响，和本身的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，在干部问题上也搞过一些派性动作。凡是支持我这一派的，就不分青红皂白，一概认为是“好干部”，一律保护，一律解放；凡是不同意我这个组织的观点的，就都是“走资派”、“牛鬼蛇神”，统统斗争，统统打倒。你说他是“好干部”，我就偏要揪住不放，非要把他打成“走资派”、“牛鬼蛇神”不可。结果真正的走资派、牛鬼蛇神反而逍遥法外，没有斗倒、斗臭，而自己的同志、革命干部，却被斗得不可开交。实际上这是混淆了敌我界限，包庇了阶级敌人，使一些应当解放的干部无法站出来。
    后来，我们在驻厂支左解放军的帮助下，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。通过反复学习毛主席最新指示，大家认识到：对待干部不能用派性去衡量，应当站在党性立场上，主要看干部对待毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的态度如何。毛主席说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”。我们牢记毛主席这一教导，对厂里的几个干部进行了阶级分析。该解放的解放，该打倒的打倒。凡是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的走资派、牛鬼蛇神，尽管他支持我们，我们也要毫不留情地把他打倒；凡是忠于毛主席无产阶级司令部的革命干部，即使他一时不支持我们，也要坚决的保护。即使犯有错误的干部，我们也按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，满腔热情地帮助他们改正缺点和错误，使他们迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”无产阶级文化大革命开展一年多来的实践证明，那个单位站在党和人民的立场上正确地对待干部，那个单位的干部就解放得早，解放得快，解放得好，那里的文化大革命就进展得快，革命的大联合就得到巩固，革命“三结合”的班子就建立得快。反之，那些单位的群众组织站在派性立场上对待干部，干部就不能真正地解放出来，文化大革命就进展得慢，革命大联合就不能得到巩固和发展。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，我们决不能再上阶级敌人的当了。我们要团结起来，彻底打倒派性，把派性搞臭，按照毛主席的干部政策，大胆地解放干部和使用干部，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献出自己的一切力量。
