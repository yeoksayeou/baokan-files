The Vietnam South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, coming from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, held a grand performance in Beijing tonight.

Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Xie Fuzhi of the State Council, as well as relevant responsible officials, representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, Red Guard Congresses of colleges and universities, and middle schools, and over 10,000 revolutionary masses from the capital watched the performance.

The magnificent Great Hall of the People was filled with the fervent atmosphere of the combat unity and great friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam. Hanging high on the opposite side of the stage were huge banners written in both Chinese and Vietnamese: "Long live the combat unity and great friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Victory to the Vietnamese people! Victory to the people of the world!" The performance began with the majestic songs "Liberate the South" and "The East is Red." The cultural warriors from South Vietnam performed with great enthusiasm songs praising the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, such as "The Voice of Uncle Ho." They sang and played songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao, such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life," and "Long Live Chairman Mao." They also performed songs that extol the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, such as the Vietnamese song "Vietnam-China." They also staged performances reflecting the heroic struggle of the military and people of South Vietnam against the American invaders, such as "The Female Guerrillas of Dong Tam," "The Victory Banner Flies High," and "Marching Towards Saigon."

The outstanding performance by the cultural warriors from South Vietnam was warmly received. Many items were encored four or five times.

During the intermission, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, and other leaders received the leaders and some members of the troupe, and after the performance, they went on stage to congratulate them on their successful performance.
