In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev raved about "retreating enough in industry, retreating enough in agriculture, including contracting production to households and individual farming!" "Retreat," "retreat," "retreat!" This single word of "retreat" blatantly exposed the wolfish ambitions of this greatest capitalist-roader within the Party.

We must loudly proclaim: Chinese Khrushchev, where exactly do you want to make our socialist country "retreat" to?!

At that time, the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were vociferously anti-China. Domestically, the class enemies were sharpening their knives, attempting to seize the opportunity of our temporary difficulties to strangle the red power of China. Faced with this situation, the question was whether to "advance" or "retreat," whether to persist in the revolution to the end or to compromise and surrender. This was a struggle between two classes and two paths.

The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, raised the three red banners high, and followed the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao. They fearlessly sacrificed, overcame all difficulties, marched forward with heads held high, and bravely advanced. Oil flowed abundantly in Daqing, and red flowers bloomed everywhere in Dazhai. Industrial and agricultural production achieved victory, and the national economy rapidly improved. This gave a resounding slap in the face to the domestic and foreign class enemies and the Chinese Khrushchev!

The Chinese Khrushchev is an old right-opportunist. Looking through the history of the two-line struggle within our Party, at every critical moment of the revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev always advocated "retreat" to meet the needs of the class enemies. It was he who, in 1927, before and after the failure of the Great Revolution, sang in tune with Chen Duxiu's opportunism, advocating that the Wuhan workers hand over their weapons, allowing Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the revolutionary workers. It was he who, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, shouted "everything through the united front," wanting our Party to give up the leadership of the anti-Japanese national united front and the principle of independence. It was he who, after the victory of the War of Resistance, wanted our Party to hand over the revolutionary army to the Kuomintang, so that he could go to the Kuomintang government to be an official.

After liberation, this Chinese Khrushchev, on a series of issues regarding the socialist revolution and socialist construction, stubbornly insisted on a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, always shouting his old tune: "retreat." He wanted to use every means to make China "retreat" from socialism and "retreat" to the capitalist society he had long dreamed of, to make the Party degenerate and the country change color. Look, how sinister the intentions of the Chinese Khrushchev are!

In stark contrast to the Chinese Khrushchev's "retreat" line, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by our great leader Chairman Mao always, no matter how difficult and arduous the times, firmly advanced. Advance, advance again, all the way to communism—this is the philosophy of our proletarian revolutionaries. To realize the great ideal of communism, we must always revolutionize! Always march forward bravely!

    要“退”往何处
    马晓峰
    一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂叫嚷什么“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干！”“退”“退”“退”！一个“退”字，赤裸裸地暴露了这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的狼子野心。
    我们要大喝一声，中国赫鲁晓夫，你究竟要使我们的社会主义国家“退”往何处？！
    当时，国际上帝、修、反的反华气焰甚嚣尘上，国内的阶级敌人也磨刀霍霍，妄图趁我国遇到暂时困难的时机，扼杀中国的红色政权。面对这种情况，是“进”还是“退”，是坚持革命到底还是妥协投降，这是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，高举起三面红旗，沿着毛主席指引的社会主义道路，不怕牺牲，排除万难，昂首阔步，奋勇前进。大庆的石油滚滚流，大寨的红花遍地盛开，工农业生产胜利发展，国民经济迅速好转。这给了国内外阶级敌人和中国赫鲁晓夫一记最响亮的耳光！
    中国赫鲁晓夫是个老牌右倾机会主义者。翻开我们党内两条路线斗争的历史，在每一个革命的紧急关头，中国赫鲁晓夫总是迎合阶级敌人的需要主张向后“退”的。就是他，在一九二七年大革命失败前后，和陈独秀取消主义唱一个调子，主张武汉工人交出手里的武装，让蒋介石来枪杀革命工人。就是他，在抗日战争时期，叫嚷“一切经过统一战线”，要我党放弃抗日民族统一战线的领导权和独立自主的原则。就是他，在抗战胜利以后，要我党把革命武装交给国民党，好让他到国民党政府里去做官。
    解放后，这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在对待社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一系列问题上，顽固地坚持一条反革命修正主义路线，总是声嘶力竭地唱他的老调：“退”。他就是要千方百计使中国“退”出社会主义，“退”向他所梦寐以求的资本主义社会去，使党变质，国家变色。看，中国赫鲁晓夫的用心何其毒辣！
    与中国赫鲁晓夫的“退”字路线针锋相对，以我们伟大领袖毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，不论在多么艰难困苦的时候，总是坚定不移向前进的。前进、再前进，一直进到共产主义，这就是我们无产阶级革命派的哲学。为了实现共产主义的伟大理想，我们就是要永远革命！永远勇往直前！
