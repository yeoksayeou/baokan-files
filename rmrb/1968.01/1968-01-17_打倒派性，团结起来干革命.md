The two revolutionary mass organizations in our Zizhuyuan Primary School have undergone a fierce struggle of ideas to transition from severe opposition to a relatively solid organizational and ideological unity.

The two factions in our school have been engaged in "internal warfare" for several months, and the conflict has become increasingly intense. Each side has been pulling the other's hair, exposing each other's "sores," and exaggerating minor issues to the extreme. During meetings, the lines were clearly drawn, and even when reading Chairman Mao's quotations, they were taken out of context and used to suppress the other side. Factionalism has interfered with the overall direction of the struggle and seriously affected the resumption of classes and the revolution.

A thunderous call resonated, as Chairman Mao issued the call for revolutionary unity: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Under the impetus of the revolutionary unity at that time, the two revolutionary mass organizations formally united. However, since neither side had completely overcome factionalism, they had not truly united ideologically.

The PLA comrades who assisted in military training at the school, in response to this situation, held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with us, focusing on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and criticizing and repudiating oneself" to learn from the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. By reviewing the past year and a half of the Cultural Revolution, everyone realized the harm of factionalism: factionalism prevented us from quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fostering a bad academic style of taking things out of context and learning without applying; factionalism caused us to confuse friends and enemies, treating comrades as enemies; factionalism caused us to fall behind Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Ideological factionalism has gradually been eliminated, and Mao Zedong Thought has truly united us ideologically. Some comrades excitedly said: "The reactionary bourgeois line split us apart, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism made us fight, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line brought us back together."

Factionalism is a vicious enemy of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We must thoroughly eliminate factionalism from the depths of our souls and allow proletarian party spirit to take root in our minds. Only in this way can we forever follow Chairman Mao and bravely advance through storms and waves.

    打倒派性，团结起来干革命
    北京市紫竹院小学革命委员会
    我们紫竹院小学的两派革命群众组织，从严重对立到组织上、思想上比较巩固地联合起来，是经过了一番激烈的思想斗争的。
    我校两派革命群众组织打了几个月的“内战”，而且越打越激烈。两派互揪辫子、互揭“疮疤”，抓住对方一点小问题就无限上纲。开起会来，“壁垒分明”，即使读毛主席语录，也是断章取义，各取所需，借以压倒对方。派性干扰了斗争大方向，也严重影响了复课闹革命。
    一声春雷震天响，毛主席发出了革命大联合的号召：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”在当时革命大联合形势推动下，两个革命群众组织虽然从形式上算是联合起来了。但是，由于双方都还没有斩断派性这条毒蛇，所以没有真正的从思想上联合起来。
    在学校帮助军训的解放军同志，针对这种情况，和我们一起办了毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，反复学习“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示，增强无产阶级的党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性。通过回顾一年多来的文化大革命，大家认识到派性的危害性：派性使我们不能很快地落实毛主席的最新指示，滋长了断章取义、学而不用的坏学风；派性使我们分不清敌友，把同志当敌人对待；派性使我们跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    思想上的派性逐步消除了，毛泽东思想使我们真正从思想上联合起来了。有的同志兴奋地说：“资产阶级反动路线把我们分了家，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性使我们打架，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线又使我们走到一起来了。”
    派性是无产阶级文化大革命的凶恶敌人，我们要从灵魂深处彻底挖去派性，让无产阶级的党性在自己头脑中扎根。只有这样才能永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中奋勇前进。
