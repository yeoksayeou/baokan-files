The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. He has solved a series of major problems that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin could not solve and did not have time to solve in the international communist movement, especially the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. In the history of Marxism, he has opened up a completely new and great era of Mao Zedong Thought.

To thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a need of class struggle, a need of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great and glorious task assigned to us by the times. It is the lifelong battle task of revolutionary fighters of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat can we keep up with the development of the situation and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; only then can we resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Study Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a strong class feeling for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

To study Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, one must have a strong class feeling for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, so as to study and apply it well.

In the old society, I was a poor and bitter child. My ancestors were oppressed and exploited by landlords and officials. It was Chairman Mao who saved my family from misery, and it was Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured me. I have a strong class feeling for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. I have decided to spend my life reading Chairman Mao's books and following the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution. However, after the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I did not fully understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and latest instructions.

At the historic and epoch-making Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." Chairman Mao pointed out, "China's Khrushchev stands on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, practices bourgeois dictatorship, and tries to suppress the great and magnificent proletarian cultural revolution movement. ... He is long on the wind of the bourgeoisie and short on the spirit of the proletariat. How poisonous it is! In light of the rightist trend of 1962 and the 'left' but rightist trend of 1964, isn't it a wake-up call?"

I read Chairman Mao's big-character poster over and over again, and the more I read, the clearer I became. Using Chairman Mao's teachings, I compared China's Khrushchev's various crimes and realized that China's Khrushchev is the most dangerous enemy hidden within our Party. If his plot succeeds, socialism will regress to capitalism, and hundreds of millions of people will fall back into misery, and the heads of thousands and thousands of people will roll. What a dangerous situation that would be!

Later, the great helmsman Chairman Mao called on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to unite and seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, to achieve great unity of the revolutionaries, to achieve the three-in-one combination of revolution, to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and to reform their own units. Chairman Mao's series of great strategic deployments have led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from one victory to another. My understanding and consciousness have also been continuously raised. In the past, I only knew how to hate Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Today, I see that the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are the most dangerous enemies under the dictatorship of the proletariat and must be resolutely overthrown and prevented from ever rising again. I deeply realize that without Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and great revolutionary theory, there would be no future for the Chinese revolution, no future for the world revolution, and no future for the revolutionary people.

With a strong class feeling of boundless love for the great helmsman Chairman Mao, I study Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, constantly raising my consciousness of socialist revolution. Over the past year, I have collected many of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and memorized them all. Wherever I go, I study and apply them. I study Chairman Mao's latest instructions in conjunction with his consistent teachings, so my understanding is more comprehensive, my grasp is deeper, and my memory is more solid. Every evening, I review what I have seen, heard, thought, and done during the day, using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to examine myself. If it conforms to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I persist and carry it forward; if it deviates from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I criticize and resist it, letting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and great theory guide me every day.

Follow Chairman Mao's footsteps and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions step by step.

Vice Chairman Lin said: In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of the great commander-in-chief, if we listen well to our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao—this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!

Chairman Mao created the great theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and personally led and directed our revolutionary practice. At every critical moment, it is he who points the way for us. I feel that following the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is a key issue in achieving overall victory in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To follow means to act immediately and see results. At the beginning of last year, Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left. At that time, our company had not participated in the "three supports and two militaries" work, but the Party branch immediately organized everyone to study seriously and carry out the call. We decided that every Tuesday would be Mao Zedong Thought propaganda day, and all officers and soldiers in the company would go to the production teams to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, with everyone doing mass work and each person being a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Later, whenever Chairman Mao issued a new instruction, we would immediately study and carry it out. We also organized all the soldiers in the company to establish fixed contacts with their families, relatives, and the 294 production teams in the area where we are stationed, promptly propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

To follow means to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions whether we understand them or not. Chairman Mao is the great teacher of all the people in the world. He stands the highest and sees the farthest. We cannot fully understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions at once, but we must carry them out one hundred percent. Last September, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile organizations." At first, I thought that in the factory where I work, the antagonism between the two factions was quite strong. Could they unite quickly? If I went to do work for the two factions, would they say I was compromising and "muddling through"? The facts proved that my concerns were unnecessary. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction was issued, it immediately received a warm response from the broad revolutionary masses. They said that Chairman Mao's latest instruction reflected the urgent demands of the broad working class and expressed the heartfelt words of the working class. The two factions of revolutionary masses quickly united. This made me deeply realize: Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power. At any time and in any situation, we must believe in them without doubt and carry them out resolutely. Only by carrying them out resolutely can we fundamentally understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

To follow means to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the practice of class struggle. The broad revolutionary masses understand and carry out Chairman Mao's instructions best by personally participating in revolutionary practice. We must follow Chairman Mao by going to the masses. In early July last year, the higher authorities sent me to participate in the work of supporting the left. I followed Chairman Mao's teachings to be a student of the masses, going deep into the masses to learn, ask, observe, and think, deepening my understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

To follow means to correct mistakes immediately. Chairman Mao said: "Everyone is bound to make mistakes, and we ask that they be fewer. Once a mistake is made, it should be corrected as quickly and thoroughly as possible." In our minds, there are more or less non-proletarian thoughts, and various non-proletarian thoughts hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. If mistakes are made in the implementation, it shows that we have not kept up with Chairman Mao; if mistakes are not corrected, we will deviate more and more from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In September last year, when Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction to set up study classes, the two factions of revolutionary masses in the factory where I work responded enthusiastically. However, due to the strong antagonism between the two factions, many people advocated that each faction should set up its own study class. I felt that the contradictions between the two factions were great, and setting up separate classes for each faction would avoid trouble, so I yielded to the incorrect opinion. Later, I saw in the newspaper reports of the two factions jointly setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes and advanced experiences, and I reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. I realized that setting up separate study classes for each faction not only could not effectively overcome various incorrect thoughts in achieving great unity of the revolution but also objectively fostered factionalism, which was not in line with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, I actively worked in the two factions, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and consulted with the leaders and masses of the two factions to quickly set up study classes attended by all mass organizations. In the study class, I checked my shortcomings and mistakes with the masses, and together with the revolutionary masses of the two factions, I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, inspiring everyone to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, speaking less about others' shortcomings and mistakes, and more about self-criticism. The entire factory quickly achieved great unity of the revolution on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. I felt that: the process of correcting mistakes is the process of mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Correcting mistakes quickly means following Chairman Mao more closely, and correcting them thoroughly means following Mao Zedong Thought more closely.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the course of the movement, there are new things ahead. New things are endless. To study the overall development of this movement is a major subject that we must always pay attention to." To make our thoughts adapt to the new situation of the deepening Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must follow the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao step by step. If we follow consciously, we can keep up with the new situation, grasp new situations, and solve new problems. If we follow firmly, we can eliminate various interferences and impacts and always stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the depths of the soul, launch a revolution and thoroughly transform the worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls." To study Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in this great revolution, we must thoroughly eliminate all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, thoroughly transform our worldview, launch a revolution in the depths of our souls, and consciously wage a struggle against the "self."

In the past, I did not fully understand self-revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I saw the revolutionary masses breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit, daring to think, speak, revolt, and rebel with great courage, and I was greatly educated. I deeply realized that if the revolution of thought stops, it is the beginning of backwardness. To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must constantly launch a revolution in the depths of our souls.

When I first participated in the work of supporting the left, I looked before and after, a little afraid of taking risks, thinking that it would be better to have less contact and less talk to avoid falling and making mistakes. These thoughts flashed in my mind again and again. Flashing is the "self" acting up. I studied Chairman Mao's instructions with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," and "we must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear." I felt that my thoughts were wrong. Chairman Mao said: "Within the Communist Party, there are various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line." I participated in the work of supporting the left, and in order not to make mistakes and have problems, I dared not contact the masses. In short, it was the "self" acting up. "Self" is the biggest obstacle to carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions.

Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit, can we stand firmly and clearly in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fear no risks, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and remain loyal to Chairman Mao's red heart forever unchanged. After establishing this firm belief, I actively studied Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary masses, squeezing out time to go to the masses to report my study experiences. When disagreements arose within the revolutionary mass organizations, I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them repeatedly, helping them overcome factionalism and enhance unity.

From practice, I deeply felt that: to launch a revolution in the depths of the soul, one must grasp the "self" that appears in the struggle between the two lines. In this way, one grasps the key to self-revolution and the biggest enemy of ideological revolutionization. The more resolute and conscious the revolution is launched on this key issue, the more thorough and effective the transformation of the worldview will be.

The great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must study and apply repeatedly. I have not studied enough and still very shallowly. However, I am determined to study for a lifetime, implement for a lifetime, propagate for a lifetime, and defend for a lifetime. I must act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implement them sentence by sentence and instruction by instruction, and be a good fighter who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    永远无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席  做执行毛主席最新指示的模范
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、解放军广州部队某部教导员　黄祖示
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林当时不可能解决和没有来得及解决的国际共产主义运动面临的一系列重大问题，特别是解决了在无产阶级专政下继续革命、防止资本主义复辟的问题，在马克思主义发展史上，开创了一个完全崭新的毛泽东思想的伟大新时代。
    大学大用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，是阶级斗争的需要，是无产阶级专政的需要，是时代赋予我们的极其伟大的光荣任务，是无产阶级革命战士毕生的战斗任务。在无产阶级文化大革命中，只有学好、用好毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论，才能跟上形势的发展，跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署；才能坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    带着对毛主席革命路线强烈的阶级感情学
    学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论，要带着对毛主席革命路线强烈的阶级感情，才能学好、用好。
    在旧社会，我是一个苦大仇深的穷孩子，祖祖辈辈都受着地主、官老爷的压迫和剥削，是毛主席把我家救出了苦海，是毛泽东思想哺育我成长。我对毛主席、毛泽东思想是有强烈的阶级感情的。我下定决心，一辈子读毛主席的书，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。可是，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我对毛主席的革命路线和最新指示都不够理解。
    在具有伟大划时代意义的党的八届十一中全会上，我们伟大领袖毛主席写了《炮打司令部》的大字报。毛主席指出，中国赫鲁晓夫“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，……长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”我把毛主席的大字报反反复复地读了几十遍，越读心里越亮堂。我用毛主席的教导，对照中国赫鲁晓夫的种种罪行，认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫是隐藏在我们党内的最危险的敌人。如果让他的阴谋得逞，社会主义就要倒退到资本主义，亿万人民就会重入苦海，千百万人头就要落地，世界革命胜利就要推迟。这是一个多么危险的情景啊！
    以后，伟大统帅毛主席号召无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资派夺权，号召无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合，革命三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位的斗批改。毛主席的这一系列的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命从一个胜利引向更大的胜利。我的认识和觉悟也就不断得到提高。过去，我只知道仇恨蒋介石和地、富、反、坏、右。今天，我看清了党内最大的一小撮走资派是无产阶级专政下最危险的敌人，必须坚决把他们打倒，叫他们永世不得翻身。我深深认识到，没有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，没有毛主席伟大的革命理论，就没有中国革命的前途，没有世界革命的前途，就没有革命人民的一切。
    我带着对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱的强烈阶级感情，学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论和毛主席的最新指示，不断提高自己社会主义革命的觉悟。一年多来，我收集了很多条毛主席的最新指示，条条熟记在脑子里，走到那里学到那里，用到那里。我把毛主席的最新指示和一贯教导联系起来学习，理解就比较全面，领会就比较深刻，记得就比较牢固。每天晚上，我都把一天的所见所闻，所思所想，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线对照检查，符合毛主席革命路线的就坚持，就发扬，违背毛主席革命路线的就批判，就抵制，让毛主席的革命路线和伟大理论，天天统帅自己。
    步步紧跟毛主席，条条落实毛主席的最新指示
    林副主席说：这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！
    毛主席创造了在无产阶级专政下进行革命的伟大理论，又亲自领导和指挥我们的革命实践，每个关键时刻，都是他老人家给我们指引方向。我体会到，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，让毛主席一系列的最新指示条条落实，是夺取这场无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个最重要的关键问题。
    紧跟，就是要闻风而动，立竿见影。去年初，毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召。当时我们连没有参加“三支”“两军”工作，但是，党支部立即组织大家认真学习，坚决贯彻。确定每个星期二为毛泽东思想宣传日，全连干部战士一齐出动，到生产队宣传毛泽东思想，人人做群众工作，个个做毛泽东思想宣传员。以后，毛主席每一个最新指示一传达，我们都是立即学习，坚决照办。我们还组织全连战士，和自己家庭、亲属以及驻地的二百九十四个生产队建立固定联系，及时地宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    紧跟，就是对毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行。毛主席是全世界人民的伟大导师，站得最高，看得最远。毛主席的最新指示，我们不可能一下子全部理解，但是，我们必须百分之百地照办。去年九月，毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”开始我想，我所在的工厂，两大派的对立情绪比较重，能够很快地联合起来吗？我去做两派的工作，人家会不会说我搞折衷、“和稀泥”呢？事实证明，我的顾虑是多余的。当毛主席的最新指示传来以后，立即受到广大革命群众的热烈响应。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，反映了我们广大工人的迫切要求，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。两派革命群众很快就联合起来了。这使我深刻地认识到：毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，我们在任何时候，任何情况下都要坚信不疑，坚决照办。只有坚决照办，才能从根本上理解毛主席的最新指示。
    紧跟，就要到阶级斗争的实践中活学活用毛主席的最新指示。广大革命群众亲自参加革命实践，对毛主席的指示理解得最深，执行得最好。我们要紧跟毛主席，就是要到群众中去。去年七月初，上级派我参加了支左工作。我遵照毛主席关于甘当群众小学生的教导，深入到群众中去学，去问，去看，去想，加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解。
    紧跟，就要知错就改。毛主席说：“任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好”。在我们头脑里，或多或少都存在着非无产阶级思想，各种非无产阶级思想妨碍着对毛主席最新指示的贯彻执行。执行中出了差错，就表明没有跟上毛主席；如果错了不改，就会越来越背离毛主席的革命路线。去年九月间，当毛主席发出办学习班的最新指示时，我所在的工厂，两派革命群众都积极地响应。但由于两派对立情绪比较大，不少人主张各派办各派的学习班。我感到两派矛盾大，各派办各派的免得找麻烦，就迁就了不正确的意见。后来，我看到报纸上介绍两派一起办毛泽东思想学习班的事迹和先进经验后，重温毛主席最新指示，认识到两派各自办学习班，不但不能很好克服实现革命大联合中的各种错误思想，反而在客观上助长了派性，不符合毛主席的最新指示。于是，我就积极在两派中进行工作，宣传毛主席的最新指示，和两派负责人、群众共同协商，很快就办起了各群众组织参加的学习班。在学习班里我向群众检查了自己的缺点错误，和两派革命群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，启发大家按照毛主席的教导去做，互相少讲别人的缺点错误，各自多作自我批评，全厂很快在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了革命大联合。我体会到：改正错误的过程，就是掌握毛泽东思想的过程。有错就改，才能紧跟毛主席，才能紧跟毛泽东思想，改得越迅速就跟得越紧，改得越彻底就跟得越好。
    毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”要使自己的思想适应无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新形势，就必须步步紧跟伟大统帅毛主席。跟得自觉，就能跟上新形势，掌握新情况，解决新问题。跟得坚定，就能排除各种干扰和冲击，始终不渝地站在毛主席的革命路线上。
    在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观
    毛主席教导我们：要斗私，批修。“无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命”。要在这场大革命中，学好毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的光辉理论，就必须肃清自己头脑里形形色色的非无产阶级思想，彻底改造世界观，在灵魂深处爆发革命，自觉地向“私”字打进攻战，自觉地进行“亮”“斗”“改”，时时刻刻把自己摆在革命对象的地位。
    过去，我对自我革命认识不足。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我看到革命群众破私立公，敢想、敢说、敢革命、敢造反的大无畏的革命精神，受到很大教育，使我深深认识到，如果思想革命停下来，就是落后的开始。要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要不断地在灵魂深处大闹革命。
    刚参加支左工作时，我瞻前顾后，有点怕担风险，心想不如少接触，少说话，免得摔跤子，犯错误。这些念头在脑子里闪了又闪。闪，就是“私”字作怪。我就带着问题学习毛主席的指示。毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明”。我感到自己的想法不对头。毛主席说：“共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大”。我参加支左工作，为了不犯错误，不出问题，不敢接触群众，说穿了就是“私”字在作怪。“私”字就是执行毛主席指示的最大障碍。
    只有活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，不畏风险，勇挑重担，天塌地陷，忠于毛主席的红心永不变。树立这种坚强信念以后，我就主动和革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，挤出时间到群众中去汇报学习的体会。革命群众组织内部出现分歧，我就和他们一起反复学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助他们克服派性，增强团结。
    从实践中，我深深体会到：在灵魂深处爆发革命，要抓住两条路线斗争中表现出来的私。这样，就抓住了自我革命的要害，抓住了思想革命化的最大敌人。在这个要害问题上爆发革命越坚决，越自觉，世界观的改造就越彻底，越有成效。
    伟大领袖毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中所作的一系列最新指示，我们要反复学习，反复运用。我学得还很不够，还很肤浅。但是，我决心学习一辈子，贯彻一辈子，宣传一辈子，捍卫一辈子，一定要照毛主席的最新指示办事，句句落实，条条落实，做一个永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线的好战士。
