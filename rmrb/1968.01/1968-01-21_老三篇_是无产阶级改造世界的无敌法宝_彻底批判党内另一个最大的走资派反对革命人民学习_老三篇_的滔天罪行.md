The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The proletariat must transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly resolved.” The biggest capitalist-roader in the party attempts to use the reactionary bourgeois worldview to transform our party and our country. Therefore, he has always opposed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and especially fiercely attacks Chairman Mao’s great works, “The Three Articles.” This is a clear exposure of his reactionary bourgeois stance and his counter-revolutionary face of conspiring to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao’s great works “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” “Serve the People,” and “The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains” most concentratedly and completely embody the proletarian worldview of being selfless, public-spirited, and dedicated to the cause of communism. Every word and sentence breaks down the “self” and establishes the “public.” Therefore, the revolutionary people affectionately and enthusiastically praise them as “The Three Articles.” These three brilliant Marxist-Leninist classics are our highest and most living textbooks for establishing a proletarian worldview. They are the boundlessly powerful spiritual atomic bombs that inspire the revolutionary people to selflessly struggle for the communist cause. They are the invincible treasures used by the proletariat to transform society and the world.

However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party maliciously slanders “The Three Articles” as having “no effect,” claiming that “studying the same few articles year after year has little effect.” This is sheer counter-revolutionary talk. In our revolution, not a moment can we do without the guidance of “The Three Articles.” Every word and deed cannot be separated from the command of “The Three Articles.” We, the ordinary workers and peasants from all over the country, who have not been liberated from the “self”? It is under the nurturing of the brilliant thoughts of “The Three Articles” that we have found “a common revolutionary goal” and gradually liberated ourselves from the “self,” growing into proletarian revolutionary fighters.

Take myself as an example! In the old society, I was a poor carpenter trampled underfoot. I was captured by the Japanese devils three times to be a laborer, experiencing the hell on earth. It was with the strong desire to overthrow and seek liberation that I joined the revolutionary ranks. Who nurtured this ordinary laborer, who originally only knew how to fight for his own liberation, into a revolutionary fighter who consciously struggles for the proletarian revolutionary cause? It was the great thought of Mao Zedong, especially the brilliant thoughts of “The Three Articles.” Chairman Mao said: “Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people’s interests.” Chairman Mao’s teachings on serving the people illuminated our hearts and lit our path forward. In the army, we heard only the teachings of serving the people, did only the work of serving the people, saw only the blood-bonded relationship between the army and the people, and even the songs we sang were “I shoulder the gun for the people.” I remember when Dong Cunrui talked to me before his death, he often said: “We are the people’s children. We must always think of the people. If it is beneficial to the people, we must strive for it; if it is not beneficial to the people, we must firmly oppose it.” Especially during the Longhua battle on May 25, 1948, Dong Cunrui’s heroic deed of sacrificing himself to blow up the fortress gave me an unforgettable education on how to serve the people. Even in his last moment, Dong Cunrui still remembered the people’s interests, and his last words were “For the new China, charge ahead!” There was no “self” in his mind. Selflessness leads to fearlessness, and fearlessness leads to invincibility. Dong Cunrui is a outstanding representative of the countless most selfless, fearless, and invincible heroes in our army. It was the brilliant thoughts of “The Three Articles” that nurtured Dong Cunrui, this good example, and it was Dong Cunrui, this good example, that made me better understand the brilliant thoughts of “The Three Articles.” I began to abandon my original idea of fighting only for personal liberation and decided to be a soldier like Dong Cunrui, dedicating my life to the people’s interests. With this thought, I was able to single-handedly charge into the enemy’s stronghold during the Changli battle, forcing more than 140 enemies to surrender their weapons. This victory was completely a victory of the brilliant thoughts of “The Three Articles.” In the past war years, how many heroes like Dong Cunrui were nurtured by the brilliant “The Three Articles”! They sacrificed their lives and shed blood for the people’s interests, charging forward fearlessly, not afraid of sacrifice, showing astonishing heroic spirit! They wrote many magnificent and heroic epics! “The Three Articles” will forever be a revolutionary march song echoing in the clouds! It is the call to arms that inspires the revolutionary people to smash the old world and advance!

Today, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we continue the revolution. “The Three Articles” have become our sharp weapon to prevent and combat revisionism in our minds and a brilliant guiding light on our path to great communism.

The facts of class struggle tell us that all reactionary classes will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. Similarly, the “self” representing their reactionary worldview will never disappear on its own. Although the reactionary classes’ guns have been seized by us and the power has been taken from them, they are still here, their hearts are not dead, and they are using various means to fight against us and will continue to do so. They still stubbornly occupy part of the ideological battlefield, spreading the poison of “self,” corrupting people’s souls, attempting to revive through “self,” and using “self” to carry out a “peaceful evolution” on the proletariat. They aim to seize the soul, seize the people, seize the guns, and seize power, ultimately achieving the evil goal of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism.

The “self” is the root cause of losing proletarian political power, and the “public” is the fundamental guarantee of consolidating proletarian political power. We revolutionary people enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao’s great call to study “The Three Articles” as a motto; use “The Three Articles” as a “mirror to expose demons,” exposing the selfish thoughts in our minds; use “The Three Articles” as an “iron broom,” sweeping away the dust of “self” on our bodies; use “The Three Articles” as a “thousand-catty club,” smashing the kingdom of “self” deep in our souls. We ensure that the proletariat does not change, the party does not change its nature, and the country does not change its color, and we will carry the socialist revolution through to the end. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party shouts that this “method is not effective” and absurdly claims that “we must make people enjoy studying,” fiercely opposing the revolutionary people’s study of “The Three Articles.” This fully proves that he wants to protect the “self,” the base for restoring capitalism. He and the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev are the defenders of the private ownership system and the advocates of private ownership ideas.

Chairman Mao said: “When the world reaches the time when all humanity consciously transforms itself and the world, that will be the era of communism.” We revolutionary fighters, with the purpose of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and realizing the communist ideal, study and apply “The Three Articles” diligently. The more we study, the more we understand, the more we study, the more we enjoy it, it is simply boundless joy. The rain nourishes the seedlings, and a new generation of communists is growing. Lei Feng studied “The Three Articles” and understood that “a person’s life is limited, but serving the people is limitless,” consciously dedicating his limited life to the limitless service of the people, and quickly grew into a great communist fighter. Cai Yongxiang studied “The Three Articles” and realized that “a revolutionary fighter’s mind cannot tolerate even a hint of selfish thoughts,” consciously fighting against “self,” with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, quickly climbing to the peak of communist spirit. There are also Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, Nian Siyang, Li Wentong, and the thousands of Red Guards who emerged during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their common characteristic is their boundless love for “The Three Articles” and their boundless yearning for communism, consciously sparking a revolution deep in their souls, seizing every hint of “self,” fiercely breaking and establishing, quickly reaching a new level of ideological transformation.

In my own journey of ideological transformation, I have the same experience. After the national victory, due to the “self” not being completely eradicated, as my personal life improved, honors increased, position rose, and age grew, the “self” in my mind often surfaced. Improved life easily breeds arrogance; more honors easily breed pride; higher position easily breeds bureaucratism; older age easily breeds pessimism; ultimately, it is the tendency to revisionism. For more than ten years, it is by studying “The Three Articles” every day, always thinking of “The Three Articles,” consulting “The Three Articles” in every matter, and comparing myself with “The Three Articles” that I have been able to break down “self” and establish “public,” resisting the infiltration of the “four tendencies,” making my worldview transformation continuously progress. I feel that fighting against the “self” in my mind is like embarking on a ten-thousand-li long march towards the spiritual world of communism. Although the journey is far, with “The Three Articles” guiding us and leading the way, this lofty goal is definitely achievable. As long as we persist, in every matter, firmly use “public” to overcome “self,” we approach the spiritual realm of communism one step at a time. This is the reason why I find studying “The Three Articles” more and more enjoyable, simply boundless joy. Our boundless yearning for communism and boundless love for “public” are certainly things that a small group of people like the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, who are full of the stench of “self,” can never understand.

The attitude towards “The Three Articles” ultimately reflects the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We revolutionary people love Chairman Mao boundlessly, love to read “The Three Articles” very much, and are determined to defend Chairman Mao and defend “The Three Articles.” Every time I pick up “The Three Articles,” I cannot help but recall the happy scenes of seeing Chairman Mao a few times, and tears cannot help but fall, and the strength in my body surges like a spring. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao for life, to use “The Three Articles” diligently for life. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, we will fight to the death with him! Whoever opposes us studying “The Three Articles,” we will not agree! We are determined to study and apply “The Three Articles” diligently, thoroughly uprooting the “self” deep in our souls. The Foolish Old Man is our example. Not only should we study “The Three Articles” and uproot selfish thoughts in this generation, but we should study and uproot it generation after generation, not stopping until we uproot this “self” and establish a red “public” world, we will not rest until we die! Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but our determination to study “The Three Articles” and walk the revolutionary path will not be abandoned! The earth may shake, the mountains may sway, but our determination to study “The Three Articles” and walk the revolutionary path will not waver! Even if the likes of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party have a thousand tricks, we will definitely make him suffer a crushing defeat.

    “老三篇”是无产阶级改造世界的无敌法宝
     ——彻底批判党内另一个最大的走资派反对革命人民学习“老三篇”的滔天罪行
    沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、战斗英雄　郅顺义
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”党内另一个最大的走资派，妄图用反动的资产阶级世界观来改造我们党，改造我们国家，因此，他一贯地反对活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，尤其疯狂地攻击毛主席的伟大著作老三篇，这是他顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，阴谋复辟资本主义的反革命面目的大暴露。
    毛主席的伟大著作《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，最集中、最完整地体现了无产阶级一心为公、一切为公、一生为公的共产主义世界观。字字句句，破的是一个“私”字，立的是一个“公”字。所以，革命人民最亲切、最热情地称颂它们为老三篇。这三部光芒四射的马克思列宁主义经典著作，是我们树立无产阶级世界观的最高最活的教材，是鼓舞革命人民为共产主义事业而忘我斗争的威力无穷的精神原子弹，是无产阶级用来改造社会、改造世界的所向无敌的法宝。
    但是，党内另一个最大的走资派却恶毒地污蔑老三篇没有“作用”，胡说什么“年年都学那几篇，作用也不大。”这是地地道道的反革命黑话。我们干革命，一时一刻也离不开老三篇的教导，一言一行都离不开老三篇的指挥。我们这些来自五湖四海的普通工人，普通农民，那一个不是在老三篇光辉思想的哺育下，才找到了“一个共同的革命目标”，逐步地从“我”字中间解放出来，成长为无产阶级革命战士的呢？
    就拿我自己来说吧！旧社会，我是一个被人踩在脚下的穷木匠，三次被日本鬼子抓去当苦工，饱尝了人间地狱的苦难。我就是怀着翻身求解放的强烈愿望，到革命队伍里来的。是谁把我这个原来只懂得为自己翻身而打仗的普通劳动人民，哺育成长为一个自觉地为无产阶级革命事业而斗争的革命战士呢？是伟大的毛泽东思想，特别是老三篇的光辉思想。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席的为人民服务的教导照红了我们的心，照亮了我们前进的路。在部队，我们听的都是为人民服务的教导，做的都是为人民服务的工作，看到的都是军队和人民血肉相连的关系，连唱的歌子也是“我为人民扛起枪”。记得董存瑞同志生前和我谈心的时候，就常说：“我们是人民的子弟兵，要永远想着人民。对人民有利的事，我们就要拚命干，对人民不利的事，我们就要坚决反对。”尤其是一九四八年五月二十五日的隆化战斗，董存瑞同志舍身炸碉堡的英雄壮举，更是给我进行了一次怎样为人民服务的终生难忘的教育。董存瑞同志就在他生命的最后一刻，还是念念不忘人民的利益，留给我们的最后一句话，就是“为了新中国，冲呵！”在他的头脑里，根本就没有自己。无私一定无畏，无畏才能无敌。董存瑞同志正是我军千千万万个最无私、最无畏、最无敌的英雄人物中一个杰出的代表。是老三篇的光辉思想哺育了董存瑞这个好榜样，又是董存瑞这个好榜样使我更加理解了老三篇的光辉思想。我开始丢掉了原来单纯为个人翻身而打仗的想法，决心做个象董存瑞一样的战士，为了人民的利益，冲它一辈子！有了这个思想，随后在昌黎战斗中，我才能够只身闯进敌人盘踞的大院里，逼迫一百四十多个敌人交枪投降。这个胜利，完全是老三篇光辉思想的胜利。伟大的老三篇，在过去的战争年代，哺育了多少象董存瑞这样“大公无私的民族的阶级的英雄”呵！他们为了人民的利益，抛头颅，洒热血，前赴后继，不怕牺牲，表现了多么惊天动地的英雄气概！写下了多少雄伟壮烈的英雄诗篇！老三篇永远是一曲响彻云霄的革命英雄进行曲！是鼓舞革命人民奋起砸烂旧世界的进军号！老三篇的无穷威力，决不是党内另一个最大的走资派之流几句黑话就可以抹杀得了的！
    今天，我们在无产阶级专政下继续革命，老三篇又成了我们从思想上防修反修的锐利武器，成了我们通向伟大的共产主义道路上一盏光辉灿烂的指路明灯。
    阶级斗争的事实告诉我们，一切反动的阶级都不会自动退出历史舞台，同样，代表他们反动世界观的“私”字，也决不会自行消亡。反动阶级的枪杆子虽然被我们缴了，印把子虽然被我们夺了，但是，他们人还在，心不死，他们正在用各种方式同我们作斗争，还要和我们继续斗下去。他们还顽固地占据着一部分思想阵地，散布“私”字的毒菌，腐蚀人们的灵魂，企图借“私”还魂，靠一个“私”字，对无产阶级实行“和平演变”。一夺魂，二夺人，三夺枪，四夺权，最后达到颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    “私”字是丧失无产阶级政权的祸根，
  “公”字是巩固无产阶级政权的根本。我们革命人民热烈响应林副主席的伟大号召，把老三篇作为座右铭来学；用老三篇这个“照妖镜”，照出头脑里的私心杂念；用老三篇这把“铁扫帚”，扫掉身上“私”字的灰尘；用老三篇这根“千钧棒”，捣毁灵魂深处“私”字的王国。保证无产阶级人不变修，党不变质，国不变色，把社会主义革命进行到底。可是党内另一个最大的走资派却叫嚷这个“办法不行”，并胡说什么“总要让人家学的有味道”，疯狂地反对革命人民学习老三篇。这就充分证明，他一心要保护“私”字这个复辟资本主义的根据地。他和中国赫鲁晓夫等一伙人就是当代私有制度的维护者和私有观念的鼓吹者。
    毛主席说：“世界到了全人类都自觉地改造自己和改造世界的时候，那就是世界的共产主义时代。”我们革命战士就是怀着巩固无产阶级专政，实现共产主义理想的目的，狠学狠用老三篇的。我们越学越开心窍，越学越有味道，简直是其乐无穷。雨露滋润禾苗壮，一代共产主义新人在成长。雷锋同志学了老三篇，懂得了“人的生命是有限的，为人民服务是无限的”，自觉地把自己“有限的生命，投入到无限的为人民服务之中去”，终于迅速地成长为一个伟大的共产主义战士。蔡永祥同志学了老三篇，认识到“革命战士的头脑里，容不得半点私心杂念”，自觉地狠斗“私”字，以只争朝夕的革命精神，终于迅速地攀登上共产主义精神的高峰。还有欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊、年四旺、李文忠，以及这次无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的千百万红卫兵革命小将们，他们的共同特点，都是无限热爱老三篇，无限向往共产主义，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，抓住“私”字一闪念，狠破狠立，使思想改造很快地达到了一个新的境界。
    我在自己思想革命化的道路上，也有着同样的体会。全国胜利后，由于“私”字没有彻底打掉，随着个人的生活好了，荣誉多了，职务高了，年龄也大了，头脑里的“私”字也就常常冒出来。生活好了，容易产生“娇”气；荣誉多了，容易产生“骄”气；职务高了，容易产生“官”气；年龄大了，容易产生“暮”气；归根到底是一个“修”气。十多年来，我就是靠着天天学习老三篇，时时想着老三篇，事事请教老三篇，处处对照老三篇，不断地破私立公，抵制“四气”的侵蚀，才使自己世界观的改造，不断地有所进步。我觉得和自己头脑里的“私”字拚刺刀，就是向共产主义的精神世界进行万里长征。路途虽远，但是，有老三篇给我们定向，有老三篇给我们领路，这个崇高的目标是一定可以达到的。只要我们坚持不懈地走下去，一事当前，坚决用“公”字吃掉“私”字，就向共产主义的精神境界接近了一步。这就是我学习老三篇，觉得越学越有味道，简直其乐无穷的道理。我们对共产主义无限向往，对一个“公”字无限热爱的感情，当然是党内另一个最大的走资派那样一小撮浑身散发着“私”字臭气的人，无论如何也理解不了的。
    对待老三篇的态度，归根到底，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的根本态度。我们革命人民无限热爱毛主席，十分爱读老三篇，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死捍卫老三篇。每当我拿起老三篇，就情不自禁地回想到几次见到毛主席的幸福情景，眼泪就禁不住往下掉，浑身的劲头，就象泉水一样往外涌。我下定决心，要一辈子紧跟毛主席，一辈子狠用老三篇。谁敢反对毛主席，我们就和他拚！谁要反对我们学习老三篇，我们坚决不答应！我们狠学狠用老三篇，彻底挖掉我们灵魂深处的“私”字的决心，早就下定了。老愚公就是我们的榜样。不但我们这一代要学老三篇，挖私心，还要世世代代学下去，挖下去，不挖尽这个“私”字，不打出一个红彤彤的
  “公”字的天下，死不暝目！头可断，血可流，我们学老三篇、走革命路的决心不能丢！地可动，山可摇，我们学老三篇、走革命路的决心不动摇！党内另一个最大的走资派之流纵然有千条诡计，我们也一定叫他碰个头破血流。
