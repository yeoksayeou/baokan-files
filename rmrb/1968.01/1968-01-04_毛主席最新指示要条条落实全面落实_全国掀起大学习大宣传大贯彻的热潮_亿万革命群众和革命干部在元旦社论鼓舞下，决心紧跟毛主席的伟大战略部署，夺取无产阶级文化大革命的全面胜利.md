The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Under the inspiration of the New Year's editorials in *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *PLA Daily*, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the nation have swiftly launched a campaign of extensive study, propaganda, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and cadres have resolved, under the inspiration of the New Year's editorial, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to summarize experiences, to advance victoriously, and to swiftly and solidly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in all respects, striving for the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, revolutionary committees and preparatory groups for revolutionary committees, as well as various revolutionary mass organizations in many regions across the country, have swiftly taken action, convening various meetings, making resolutions, and issuing notices. They have energetically propagated the New Year's editorial to the broad revolutionary masses, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

On January 2, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held a grand meeting of revolutionary cadres from various fronts, Red Guards, PLA officers and soldiers, and revolutionary cadres. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao and other leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee attended the meeting. The meeting called on the broad revolutionary cadres and masses of Shanghai to take "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the key link, to seriously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to combine running good study classes with mass study, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all respects, and to commemorate the glorious "January Revolution" of one year ago with practical actions. In Guizhou, Guangdong, Hunan, Gansu, Shijiazhuang, and other regions, large-scale mobilization meetings, oath-taking meetings, and telephone conferences were held, with thousands to tens of thousands of participants. Li Zaihan, the chairman of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, Huang Yongsheng, the head of the Guangdong Revolutionary Preparatory Group, Li Yuan, the head of the Hunan Revolutionary Preparatory Group, and Suo Henghan, the head of the Gansu Revolutionary Preparatory Group, respectively spoke at the meetings in their regions, calling on the broad revolutionary masses to immediately launch a large-scale mass campaign to study the New Year's editorial, to fully and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to implement them without any deviation in actions. The core group of the Communist Party of Shanxi Province and the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee issued a notice to the entire province, requiring each unit to set aside a few days each month to check the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Henan Revolutionary Preparatory Group decided to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought education throughout the province, to seriously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to enable the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in the province to better grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

In the campaign of extensive study, propaganda, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many regions' revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations' leaders, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "you must put politics in command, go to the masses, stay with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," have all gone deep into the grassroots, leading the revolutionary masses to study together and to research the specific measures to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

On January 2, the leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Teng Haicheng, Wu Tao, Gao Jinming, Quan Xingyuan, and Li Shude, along with other standing committee members, went to factories, troops, offices, and schools, studying and discussing the New Year's editorial with revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups and listening to their opinions. On January 3, they brought the masses' opinions back and held a standing committee meeting to further study the various measures to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The temporary leadership of the Ganzhou region in Jiangxi and the leaders of the 6810 unit have been going to more than fifty factories, offices, schools, and units in recent days, studying the editorial with revolutionary masses and researching the measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many revolutionary masses were very happy, saying that the revolutionary leaders closely follow Chairman Mao without leaving his side, and on the first day of the new year, they brought us Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

When the leaders of the Wuhan Garrison Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the temporary committee of the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress studied the New Year's editorial together, they carried forward the good learning style of combining theory with practice and learning while doing. The leaders of various workers' organizations participating in the temporary committee of the revolutionary workers' congress voluntarily canceled their own small newspapers and jointly created the *Wuhan Worker*, a unified newspaper for revolutionary workers' organizations in the Wuhan region, determined to make new contributions to consolidating and developing the great alliance.

The broad revolutionary cadres and masses are studying the New Year's editorial while summarizing experiences, finding gaps, formulating measures, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions the conscious battle program for the broad revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Steel Wire Factory, which achieved double victories in revolution and production in 1967, proposed that this year, four aspects of work must be vigorously promoted: vigorously promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, setting up models, establishing examples, and fostering a revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice throughout the factory; running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making the revolutionary workers of the entire factory more revolutionary in thought and more combative in action; carrying out a revolutionary great criticism, doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit, breaking the old and establishing the new, and building a new-type factory with Mao Zedong Thought as the commander; starting from vigorously promoting the thought revolutionization of people, doing a good job in production.

To ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the tasks set forth in the editorial are implemented in the thoughts and actions of each individual, the Revolutionary Committee of Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province, after repeated discussions, decided in the new year to: never forget the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, maintaining a strong class struggle consciousness; never relax in fighting self and criticizing revisionism, always and everywhere using the "Old Five Articles" as a weapon, fighting against selfishness, and promoting selflessness, further transforming one's worldview; never leaving the masses, often going deep into the grassroots, supporting the masses' pioneering spirit, learning, summarizing, and promoting the masses' struggle experiences; never forgetting to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making Hangzhou City a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary cultural workers of the Qinghai Opera Troupe studied the editorial sentence by sentence, proposing three measures in deeply carrying out the revolutionary great criticism and doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit: further purifying the cultural team politically, ideologically, and organizationally; thoroughly criticizing the bad plays that have been performed in the past; combining with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, doing a good job in the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit.

Under the great call to win the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in various places, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," have resolved to raise the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of selflessness to the height of the struggle between the two lines, to further establish the greatest selflessness of absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao, to thoroughly transform one's worldview, and to advance courageously along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary workers of the Erdao River Power Plant in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, which has just established a revolutionary committee, said that in the new year, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight a "people's war" of breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness, making Chairman Mao's every latest instruction bloom and bear fruit here swiftly, and completing the great task of winning the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.
