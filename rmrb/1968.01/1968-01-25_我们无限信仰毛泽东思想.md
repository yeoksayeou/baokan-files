We have unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought.

	Class Leader: Zhū Huīxiāng, Security Officer: Wáng Qǐ

The Chinese Khrushchev is frantically opposing the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental guiding ideology for the construction of our Party. He is using every possible means to oppose the broad masses of Party members and revolutionary people from studying Chairman Mao's works. Listen to what he says: "Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, whether it is 'true' or 'false,' one must study and research to know; without study and research, one has no right to speak." What a "true" and "false," what a "study and research," this is a thorough and complete reactionary fallacy.

	The Chinese Khrushchev says that one must "study and research" Mao Zedong Thought. What does he want to "study"? What does he want to "know"? He wants to "study" out the "false" from Mao Zedong Thought. Look, "study and research" is a cover, opposing Mao Zedong Thought is his true intention. Only class enemies, only reactionaries like the Chinese Khrushchev, would say that Mao Zedong Thought has "true" and "false." We, the broad masses of Party members and workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply understand that Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Looking back at history, from Shaoshan to Jinggangshan, from Yan'an to Beijing, the revolutionary journey, the fighting footsteps, all prove that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolution, and the fundamental guideline for the development and progress of our Party. The victory of the Chinese revolution, the development of revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all give a resounding answer: Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest revolutionary truth of our times, and to make a revolution, one must closely follow Chairman Mao.

	We, the Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, even more deeply feel that we cannot for a moment, a second, be separated from Mao Zedong Thought. In the People's Liberation Army, heroes and models like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Mai Xiande, and Cai Yongxiang, which one is not the result of the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought? Our class, since 1964, has emphasized proletarian politics, vigorously promoted the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, studying at all times and applying at all places. The ideological appearance of the entire class has undergone a remarkable change, work achievements have been remarkable, and we have been evaluated as a "Four Good" class year after year. In the past two years, we have also been established as a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in the army.

	We Communist Party members have always firmly believed in Chairman Mao's instructions. The Chinese Khrushchev talks about "studying and researching" Mao Zedong Thought to know "true" and "false," which is an attempt to shake our firm belief in following Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. This is a futile attempt! We will never believe in the Chinese Khrushchev's black talk. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we will firmly execute those we understand and also firmly execute those we temporarily do not understand, and we will not allow the slightest discount. Whoever wants us to leave Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end with them! Whoever obstructs us from following Chairman Mao forward, we will resolutely remove the stumbling block! For the greatest leader Chairman Mao, we will love him to the end, be loyal to the end; for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we will study it to the end, follow it to the end!

    我们无限信仰毛泽东思想
    班长　朱辉香　保密员　王启
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地反对以毛泽东思想为我们党的建设的根本指导思想，千方百计地反对广大党员和革命群众学习毛主席著作。你听，他竟然这样说：“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，到底‘是’还是‘非’，要研究一番才知道，没有学习没有研究，就没有发言权。”好一个“是”和“非”，好一个“研究一番”，这是彻头彻尾的反动谬论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫说，对毛泽东思想要
  “研究一番才知道”。他要“研究”什么？“知道”什么？他要从毛泽东思想里“研究”出“非”来。看，“研究”是幌子，反对毛泽东思想才是他的目的。只有阶级敌人，只有象中国赫鲁晓夫这样反动透顶的家伙，才会说毛泽东思想有“是”和“非”之分。我们广大党员和工农兵群众深深认识到：毛主席的话，句句是真理。翻开历史，从韶山到井冈山，从延安到北京，革命的历程，战斗的足迹，无一不证明毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命胜利的根本保证，是我党发展和前进的根本指针。中国革命的胜利，亚、非、拉美的革命运动的发展，无一不作出响亮的回答：毛泽东思想是我们时代最伟大的革命真理，干革命必须紧紧跟随毛主席。
    我们这些在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的共产党员和革命战士，更加体会到，我们一言一行、一时一刻都不能离开毛泽东思想。解放军中出现的雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、麦贤得、蔡永祥等英雄模范人物，哪一个不是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果？我们班从一九六四年以来突出无产阶级政治，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，时时学，处处用，全班的思想面貌起了显著变化，工作取得显著成绩，连年被评为“四好”班，近两年还被树立为部队学习毛主席著作标兵。
    我们共产党员对毛主席的指示，从来是坚信不疑的。中国赫鲁晓夫说什么对毛泽东思想要“研究一番”才知道
  “是”和“非”，就是企图动摇我们紧跟毛主席、紧跟毛泽东思想的坚定信念，这是痴心妄想！我们永远不会听信中国赫鲁晓夫这一套黑话。对于毛主席的指示，我们理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，决不允许打一丝一毫的折扣。谁要我们离开毛泽东思想，我们就和谁拚到底！谁要阻碍我们紧跟毛主席前进，我们就坚决搬掉绊脚石！对最伟大的领袖毛主席，我们要爱到底，忠到底；对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们要学到底，跟到底！
