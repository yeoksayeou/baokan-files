The Shijiazhuang Wire Factory, with the help of the military support units, resolutely smashed factionalism, strengthened party spirit, consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance, and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) — The People's Liberation Army propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought at the Shijiazhuang Wire Factory helped the revolutionary workers of the factory implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and established a firm proletarian party spirit. They consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The two revolutionary mass organizations in the wire factory had already achieved revolutionary great alliance in terms of organization by workshop in September last year. However, due to the lack of true unity in thought, the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions remained strong, and the revolutionary great alliance was in danger of splitting at any time. The military support personnel stationed at the factory analyzed this situation and realized that the main obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions was bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. How to smash factionalism? They reviewed the more than a year of practice fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply felt that "the masses are the real heroes." To thoroughly smash factionalism, it was necessary to fully mobilize the masses and fight a "people's war" together.

To fully mobilize the masses and smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the military support personnel went deep into the workshops and teams, and together with the revolutionary workers, studied Chairman Mao's relevant works. They launched an activity throughout the factory to "expose the forms of factionalism, discuss the harms of factionalism, and dig out the roots of factionalism." Revolutionary workers linked the situation of the previous "internal war" with their own thoughts and bitterly denounced the crimes of factionalism. With the help of the military support personnel, everyone analyzed and summarized the ten major crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, pointing out: with factionalism, the two different types of contradictions are confused, and it is not possible to distinguish between comrades and enemies; with factionalism, it is not possible to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, and one will take the wrong path; with factionalism, it is not possible to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; with factionalism, it is not possible to conduct self-criticism, and one will become a defender of the "self"; with factionalism, one will deviate from the revolutionary direction, only caring about one's own small hill; with factionalism, one will be exploited by the enemy, causing the revolution to suffer losses; with factionalism, it is not possible to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and so on. Then, the military and civilians together, through meetings, big-character posters, broadcasts, and other forms, widely propagated and listed the ten major crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, making the crimes of factionalism known to everyone, making factionalism stink, like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat it. Through this activity, revolutionary workers increased their hatred of factionalism, and many people voluntarily rose up to fiercely fight against the "self," determined to smash factionalism.

In the process of mobilizing the revolutionary workers of this factory to smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the military support personnel also did in-depth, detailed, and arduous political work. Some comrades in this factory knew that the harm of factionalism was great, but they did not dare to expose it or fight it, fearing that others would grab their "braids"; some comrades talked more about others' factionalism and less about their own. The military support personnel, together with the two factions of the masses, studied Chairman Mao's relevant statements, conducted discussions and research, and believed that to solve this problem, the key was to establish the good learning style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao. The support personnel organized the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving small differences." They repeatedly explained that whether to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions after studying them is a matter of loyalty or disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. After many revolutionary workers raised their awareness, they voluntarily exposed their factionalism at meetings, voluntarily fought against their selfishness, actively sought out workers with strong opposing sentiments and many opinions about themselves to conduct self-criticism, and used their model actions to influence and lead everyone, creating a good learning style. In this way, the vast majority of revolutionary workers overcame factionalism, eliminated barriers, and enhanced unity.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is very cunning and very stubborn, sometimes hiding very cleverly and not easily noticed. Sometimes it is smashed, but when it encounters suitable soil and climate, it pops up again. Therefore, the revolutionary workers maintained a high degree of vigilance against factionalism, fought a protracted battle, and smashed factionalism as soon as it appeared. After achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination, there was a period when some workers cooperated well with those who were originally in the same faction in production, but cooperated less and not well with those in the other faction. After discovering this, the support personnel went deep into the workshops and, together with the revolutionary workers, actively studied and applied the "Three Articles," fought against selfishness and revised the roots of factionalism. From then on, in production and work, everyone gave way to each other, cooperated with each other, and mutual assistance became the norm.

With the help of the military support personnel, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were fully implemented in this factory, and there was no foothold for bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. This powerfully promoted the rapid advancement of the revolution, promoted continuous improvements in production, and made revolutionary production very lively. Last year, the annual production plan was completed 28 days ahead of schedule, and at the beginning of this year, the production tasks were exceeded every day.

    把落实毛主席最新指示的绊脚石踢开
    石家庄铁丝厂在支左部队帮助下，坚决打倒派性，加强党性，巩固和发展了革命大联合，推进了革命三结合。
    新华社保定十五日电　人民解放军驻石家庄铁丝厂毛泽东思想宣传队帮助这个厂的广大革命职工，在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大立特立无产阶级党性，巩固和发展了革命大联合，推进了革命三结合。
    铁丝厂的两派革命群众组织，早在去年九月就在组织上按车间实现了革命大联合。但由于思想上没有真正联合，两派对立情绪仍然很大，革命的大联合随时都有分裂的危险。驻厂解放军支左人员分析这一情况，认识到妨碍毛主席最新指示落实的主要障碍是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。怎样打倒派性呢？他们回顾一年多来在无产阶级文化大革命中和广大革命群众并肩战斗的实践，深深体会到“群众是真正的英雄”，要彻底打倒派性，就必须充分发动群众，齐心协力，打一场“人民战争”。
    为了充分发动群众，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，解放军支左人员深入到车间、班组，和广大革命职工共同学习毛主席有关著作，在全厂开展“大摆派性表现形式，大论派性危害，大挖派性根子”的活动。革命职工联系前一段“内战”的情况，结合自己的思想，愤恨地控诉派性的罪恶。在解放军支左人员帮助下，大家经过分析归纳，给资产阶级、小资产阶级派性列出十大罪状，指出：有了派性，就混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，就会分不清同志和敌人；有了派性，就不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就会走歪路；有了派性，就不能全面地落实毛主席的最新指示；有了派性，就不能进行自我批评，就会成为“私”字的保皇派；有了派性，就会背离革命的大方向，只顾自己的小山头；有了派性，就会被敌人钻空子，使革命受到损失；有了派性，就不能将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，等等。接着，军民又一起通过会议、大字报、广播等形式，广泛进行宣传，历数资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的十大罪状，使派性的罪恶人人皆知，把派性搞得臭臭的，象过街的老鼠，人人喊打。通过这一活动，革命职工增强了对派性的仇恨，很多人自觉地起来狠斗“私”字，决心打倒派性。
    解放军支左人员在发动这个厂的革命职工打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的过程中，还做了深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作。这个厂有些同志明知道派性的危害极大，但又不敢亮，不敢斗，怕别人抓辫子；有些同志讲别人的派性多，讲自己的少。解放军支左人员又和两派群众一起学习毛主席有关论述，进行讨论研究，认为要解决这个问题，关键在于建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风。支左人员便组织全厂革命职工深入学习毛主席关于“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示，反复讲清对毛主席的最新指示学了之后用还是不用，是忠于不忠于伟大领袖毛主席的问题。许多革命职工提高认识以后，纷纷在会上带头亮派性，带头斗私心，主动找同自己对立情绪大的、对自己意见多的职工做自我批评，用自己的模范行动影响大家，带动大家，造成一个革命的好学风。这样一来，绝大多数革命职工克服了派性，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性十分狡猾，十分顽固，有的隐藏得很巧妙，不容易发觉。有时斗倒了，但一遇到适当的土壤和气候，就又冒出来。因此，广大革命职工对派性保持着高度的警惕，打持久战，派性一露头就斗。实现革命三结合之后，有一段时期，在生产中有些职工和原来同自己一派的人协作得好，和另一派的一起干活少，协作也不够。支左人员发现后，又深入车间，和革命职工一起活学活用“老三篇”，斗私批修，狠斗狠挖派性的根子。从此，在生产上，工作上，大家互让方便，互相协作，团结互助蔚然成风。
    在解放军支左人员的帮助下，在这个厂，毛主席的最新指示得到全面落实，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性没有地盘，有力地推动了革命迅速向前发展，促进了生产不断提高，革命生产一派热气腾腾。去年，提前二十八天完成全年生产计划，今年初又天天超额完成生产任务。
