During the three years of temporary difficulties, Chinese Khrushchev spread the "three selfs and one package" black wind, attempting to sabotage the collective economy and restore capitalism in the countryside. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region closely followed suit, working in close coordination. They used the pretext of increasing the income of commune members to actively advocate for "three clears" (divide everything, eat everything, use everything) and "four leaves" (no public accumulation fund, no public welfare fund, no reserve grain, no production funds).

After hearing this news, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wuxing Production Brigade were extremely indignant. Isn't this clearly an attempt to sabotage the collective economy and undermine the foundations of socialism?! We decided to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, to counterattack and resist the evil winds. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region, seeing that we were standing our ground, sent a work team to the production brigade. Under the guise of inspecting the completion of the state plan, they loudly proclaimed that "the collective economy has no benefits," attacking and marginalizing cadres and masses who insisted on the socialist road. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants used a wealth of facts to illustrate the tremendous changes that had occurred in the countryside since the establishment of the commune, firmly refuting their counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. Everyone said: "The collective economy is a bridge to happiness, and anyone who tries to dismantle it will find it impossible!" In this way, we drove the work team away. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region, unwilling to accept their failure, sent a second batch of "reliable cadres" to form another work team. They subjected the brigade's Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres to "three inspections and three rectifications," repeatedly instilling the black goods of the counter-revolutionary "tame tool" theory, demanding that we absolutely obey the "superior's" instructions. We, the poor and lower-middle peasant masses, debated with the work team, arguing them into a corner until they slunk away in defeat.

However, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region were not reconciled to their failure. They harbored deep hatred for the poor and lower-middle peasants' insistence on the socialist road. Soon after, they formed a third work team and came to the brigade, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on us. They announced that "Wuxing Production Brigade's democratic revolution was not thorough, and all brigade cadres must step down." After driving the revolutionary cadres down, they went all out to restore capitalism, vigorously promoting "three clears and four leaves," dissolving the pastures and brigade enterprises, and dividing up all the collective pigs, reserve grain, and public accumulation funds. The entire brigade was in chaos.

"Three clears and four leaves" severely struck at the collective economy, leaving no production funds, making it extremely difficult to resume production.

"Three clears and four leaves" catered to the needs of capitalist forces, delighting the landlords and rich peasants. They clapped their hands and cheered, saying, "The days of prosperity are coming soon." While the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region was dismantling the brigade enterprises, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements took the opportunity to launch a counterattack, seizing back the property that had been designated as collective property.

"Three clears and four leaves" struck at the poor and lower-middle peasants. They were politically suppressed and faced difficulties in their lives, especially the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, cadres, and the poor, who did not receive the care they deserved, causing great difficulties.

"Three clears and four leaves" also opened the door to speculation, usury, and hiring labor for exploitation.

It is very clear that "three clears and four leaves" is a poison pill coated with sugar. It tastes sweet going down but is deadly once ingested. It directly opposes Chairman Mao's teachings on "organizing together" to develop the socialist collective economy. It is a product of Chinese Khrushchev's "three selfs and one package" black wind, a poisonous scheme to disintegrate the collective economy and restore capitalism.

Clouds cannot obscure the sun. Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "never forget class struggle," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wuxing Production Brigade rose up to fight against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in this region, seizing the reins of power back into their own hands and thoroughly smashing the enemy's ferocious counterattack. Now, the public accumulation and reserve grain in every production team have increased, the collective economy is becoming stronger, and the enthusiasm of the commune members to learn from Dazhai and follow the Dazhai road is growing.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete and solid socialism." From the fierce struggle between the two roads, we deeply feel that whether the five hundred million peasants follow Chairman Mao's socialist road is the key to the success or failure of the socialist revolution, determining the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system. Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to sabotage the socialist revolution in the countryside and lead us down the capitalist road is a pipe dream! We warn Chinese Khrushchev and his gang: the five hundred million peasants will definitely follow the great leader Chairman Mao on the socialist road. Anyone who dares to stir up trouble, sabotage the foundations of socialism, and restore capitalism will have their spines broken and will never be able to rise again!

    不许挖社会主义墙脚
    五星大队原党支部书记　陆寿鹏
    在三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“三自一包”黑风，阴谋搞垮集体经济，在农村复辟资本主义。本地区党内一小撮走资派亦步亦趋，密切配合。他们以增加社员收入为名，积极主张实行“三光”（分光、吃光、用光）、“四不留”（不留公积金、公益金、贮备粮、生产资金）。
    我们五星大队贫下中农听到这个消息以后，非常气愤，这不明明是要搞垮集体经济，挖社会主义墙脚吗？！我们决心听毛主席的话，以毛泽东思想为武器，针锋相对，顶住妖风。本地区党内一小撮走资派见我们按兵不动，便派工作组来生产队，以查国家计划完成情况为名，大叫大嚷“集体经济没有好处”，打击、排挤坚持走社会主义道路的干部和群众。广大贫下中农以大量事实说明公社化后农村发生的改天换地的巨大变化，狠狠驳斥了他们的反革命修正主义的谬论。大家说：“集体经济是幸福桥，谁想拆桥一万个办不到！”就这样把工作组赶走了。本地区党内一小撮走资派还不死心，又选派“得力干部”组成第二批工作组，对大队的共产党员、革命干部实行“三查三整”，反复灌输反革命“驯服工具”论的黑货，要我们绝对服从“上级”的指示。我们贫下中农群众跟工作组辩论，辩得他们理屈词穷，只得灰溜溜地滚了回去。
    但是，本地区党内一小撮走资派并不甘心于他们的失败，他们对贫下中农坚持走社会主义的道路恨之入骨。过了不久，他们又组成第三批工作组来到大队，对我们实行资产阶级专政。他们宣布五星大队“民主革命不彻底，大队干部统统下台”。他们把革命干部打下去以后，就放手大搞资本主义复辟，不遗余力地推行“三光四不留”，解散了牧场和社队企业，把大队集体所有的生猪、贮备粮和公积金，分得一干二净。整个大队搞得乌烟瘴气。
    “三光四不留”，严重打击了集体经济，连生产资金都不留，使再生产遭到极大的困难。
      “三光四不留”，迎合了资本主义势力的需要，乐坏了地主富农。他们一个个拍手叫好说，“竹竿挑水后面长，发财的日子快到了。”在本地区党内一小撮走资派拆散社队企业的同时，地、富、反、坏分子乘机反攻倒算，把已划为集体所有的财产拿回家中。
      “三光四不留”，打击了贫下中农。他们在政治上受到压抑，生活上遭到困难，尤其是烈、军、工、干四属和困难户得不到应有的照顾，造成很大的困难。
        “三光四不留”，还给投机倒把、放高利贷、雇工剥削开了方便之门。
    十分明显，“三光四不留”就是一帖裹着糖衣的砒霜，吃进甜蜜蜜，落肚害煞人。它直接反对毛主席关于“组织起来”发展社会主义集体经济的教导。它是中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”黑风的产物，是瓦解集体经济、复辟资本主义的毒计。
    乌云遮不住太阳。在毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”伟大号召的鼓舞下，五星大队贫下中农奋起造了本地区党内一小撮走资派的反，把印把子重新掌握在自己的手里，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂反扑。现在每个生产队的公共积累和贮备粮普遍增加，集体经济越来越雄厚，社员学大寨、走大寨之路的劲头越来越高。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”从两条道路的激烈斗争中，我们深刻体会到，五亿农民跟不跟毛主席走社会主义道路，是社会主义革命成败的关键，决定着无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的命运。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想破坏农村社会主义革命，把我们引向资本主义道路，这是白日做梦！我们警告中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，五亿农民跟伟大领袖毛主席走社会主义大道是走定了。谁敢兴风作浪，挖社会主义墙脚，复辟资本主义，我们就砸断他的脊梁骨，叫他永世不得翻身！
