The most joyous, most exciting, and most unforgettable moment has finally arrived. I have seen the most beloved and revered leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Following your teachings, to defend the borders, build a new Tibet, and for the liberation of all oppressed people around the world, we came to Kaji La Mountain, more than two thousand kilometers away from Beijing, in 1954. We established a supply station on this mountain at an altitude of 4,800 meters. At that time, our belongings were only a tent and a cooking pot on our backs, but because we carried your sacred book, we were fearless. We finally took root on the snowy mountains and icy ridges. The plateau lacks oxygen, but your teachings gave us rich political air; the plateau is cold, but your brilliant thoughts gave us endless warmth; the plateau lacks water, but your sacred book became an inexhaustible source of strength for us; although Kaji La is high, in the face of revolutionaries armed with your thoughts, it is just a horizon. No matter how great the difficulties, our red hearts serving the people will never change. We regard the supply station as the frontline of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and as a "high point" to strike at imperialism and reactionaries of all countries.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The soldiers on the plateau miss you the most. Every morning, we stand on the high mountain and look towards the rising sun in the east, singing "The East Is Red" with all our hearts. Every night, we gather around the radio to listen to the voice of Beijing. Whenever we hear your latest instructions, we involuntarily raise our arms and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" We fervently wish you good health forever! We swear to you over the radio: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will resolutely defend your revolutionary line, follow your strategic deployments, and resolutely carry out your latest instructions. We write your latest instructions on red paper, paste them by the roadside, and deliver them to the hearts of Tibetan herdsmen.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your colored portraits hang all over the supply station, and your instructions are posted all over Kaji La Mountain. Every time we see your portraits and study your instructions, we feel a boundless energy surging through our bodies. It is you who inspired us to overcome countless difficulties; it is you who taught us to diligently serve the passing troops with all our hearts. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts can turn snow-capped mountains into fertile land and turn harsh winters into spring. Your thoughts are more important than the oxygen on the plateau, and your brilliance is warmer than the sun on the snow-capped mountains! We will let our red hearts melt the snow for a thousand miles, and we will let our hot blood warm the ice for ten thousand miles. The supply station is a propaganda station for your brilliant thoughts. Although Kaji La Supply Station is far away from Beijing across mountains and rivers, our hearts are closely connected with your revolutionary line, closely connected! We are determined to forever be loyal to you, to your revolutionary line, and to your great thoughts, and to revolutionize with you for life.

    高原战士最热爱毛主席
    总后勤部学习毛主席著作积极分子、卡集拉兵站站长  刘明伟
    最最幸福、最最激动、最最难忘的时刻终于来到了。我见到了日也盼、夜也想的最敬爱的伟大领袖，我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！遵照您的教导，为了保卫边疆，建设新西藏，为了全世界被压迫人民的翻身解放，我们于一九五四年来到了距离北京两千多公里的卡集拉山，在这座海拔四千八百米的高山上建立了兵站。当时我们的家当，虽然只有背上的一顶帐篷，一口饭锅，但是由于我们身上带着您的宝书，我们天不怕，地不怕，终于在雪山冰岭上扎下了根。高原缺氧，您的教导给了我们浓厚的政治空气；高原严寒，您的光辉思想给了我们无限的温暖；高原缺水，您的宝书成了我们取之不尽用之不竭的力量源泉；卡集拉虽高，但在您的思想武装起来的革命战士面前，只不过是一道地平线。那怕有天大的困难，我们为人民服务的一颗红心永不变。我们把兵站作为斗私批修的前沿阵地，作为打击帝国主义和各国反动派的“制高点”。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！高原战士最最想念您。每天清晨，我们站在高山遥望东方那轮喷薄欲出的朝阳，纵情高唱《东方红》。每天晚上，我们都围在收音机旁收听北京的声音。每当听到您的最新指示时，我们就情不自禁地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”满腔热情地祝福您老人家万寿无疆！我们对着收音机向您老人家宣誓：毛主席呀，毛主席！您的革命路线我们坚决捍卫，您的战略部署我们一定紧跟，您的最新指示我们坚决执行。我们把您的最新指示，写在红纸上，贴在公路旁，送到藏族牧民的心坎上。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！您的彩色画像挂满了兵站，您的指示贴满了卡集拉山。看到您的每一张画像，学习您的每一条指示，我们都感到浑身有一股使不完的力量。是您，鼓舞着我们战胜了重重困难；是您，教导着我们勤勤恳恳地端盘端碗，全心全意地为过往部队服务。毛主席呀，毛主席！您的光辉思想能使雪山冰岭变沃土，使风雪严寒变春天。您的思想比高原上的氧气重要，您的光辉比雪山上的太阳温暖！我们要让红心熔化千里雪，我们要让热血暖化万里冰。兵站就是您的光辉思想的宣传站。卡集拉兵站虽然远隔北京千山万水，我们的心和您的革命路线却紧紧相连，紧紧相连！我们决心永远忠于您，忠于您的革命路线，忠于您的伟大思想，跟您干一辈子革命。
