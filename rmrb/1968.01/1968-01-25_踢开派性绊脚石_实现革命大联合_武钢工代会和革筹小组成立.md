The revolutionary masses of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, with the assistance of the military units stationed there to support the left, used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon. They kicked away the obstacles of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, achieved great revolutionary unity, and established the Wuhan Steel and Iron Company Revolutionary Workers' Congress and the Preparatory Committee for the Wuhan Steel and Iron Company Revolutionary Committee. They also reached an agreement on the establishment of the Wuhan Steel and Iron Company Revolutionary Committee.

After the news of the revolutionary unity of various revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhan Steel and Iron Company spread, the entire steel city was filled with joy. Revolutionary workers were overjoyed and unanimously believed that this was another victory for Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the inspiration of the call to welcome the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and with the assistance of the military units stationed in Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, the leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," quickly organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought together. They earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The more they studied, the broader their minds became, the higher their class consciousness rose, the more urgent their desire to achieve revolutionary unity became, and the greater their determination grew. They said, the current task in Wuhan Steel and Iron Company is to achieve revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, which is the most important direction, the most important politics, and the most urgent matter. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and become true proletarian revolutionaries. In the study class, they listened together to the military comrades lecturing on revolutionary war history, listened to revolutionary old workers denouncing the exploitation of capitalists, and recalled the friendship forged in the great waves of class struggle. This further inspired their common class feelings. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness" and "the two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak for themselves, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." They earnestly carried out the criticism of revisionism and selfishness, did more self-criticism, overcame factionalism, and together removed the obstacles hindering the achievement of revolutionary unity, making many problems quickly resolved. During the discussions on revolutionary unity, there were moving scenes of mutual non-competition for positions and seats.

After achieving revolutionary unity, the broad revolutionary workers firmly declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and contribute all their efforts to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    踢开派性绊脚石  实现革命大联合
    武钢工代会和革筹小组成立
    新华社武汉二十四日电  武汉钢铁公司的无产阶级革命派，在驻武钢支左部队的帮助下，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，踢开资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这个绊脚石，实现革命大联合，成立了武钢革命工代会和武钢革命委员会筹备小组，并且达成了关于建立武钢革命委员会的协议。
    武钢各革命群众组织实现革命大联合的喜讯传出以后，十里钢城喜气洋洋，广大革命职工欢欣鼓舞，一致认为这是毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一个胜利。
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利这个伟大战斗号召的鼓舞下，在驻武钢支左部队的帮助下，武钢三个革命群众组织的负责人以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，很快就共同办起毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示。他们越学胸怀越开朗，阶级觉悟越提高，要求实现革命大联合的心情越迫切，决心越大。他们说，当前在武钢实现革命大联合和革命三结合是最大的方向，最大的政治，是当务之急。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，作真正的无产阶级革命派。他们在学习班里一起听解放军同志讲革命战争史，听革命老工人控诉资本家的剥削，回顾在阶级斗争大风浪中共同战斗的友谊，更加激发了共同的阶级感情。他们遵循毛主席“要斗私，批修”和“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的伟大教导，认真地开展斗私批修，各自多做自我批评，克服派性，大家一齐动手来搬掉妨碍实现革命大联合的绊脚石，使得许多问题很快就迎刃而解。在商谈革命大联合的过程中，出现了互相不争名额，不争席位的感人情景。
    广大革命职工在实现革命大联合以后最坚决地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而贡献自己的一切力量。
