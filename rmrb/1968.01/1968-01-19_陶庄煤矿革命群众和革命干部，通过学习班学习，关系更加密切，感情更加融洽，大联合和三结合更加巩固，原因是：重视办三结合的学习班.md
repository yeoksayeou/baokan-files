The revolutionary masses and cadres at Taozhuang Coal Mine, through study classes, have strengthened their bonds and improved their relationships, solidifying the great alliance and the three-in-one combination. The reason for this is:

Emphasizing the Three-in-One Combination Study Classes

Under the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, the revolutionary masses of Taozhuang Coal Mine, affiliated with the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau in Shandong, have since last September organized 49 sessions of three-in-one combination study classes, both full-time and part-time, with over 3,000 cadres, revolutionary faction leaders, and revolutionary masses participating. Through these study classes, the awareness of the majority of cadres and masses has rapidly improved, their relationships have become more harmonious, and the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination have been significantly promoted.

Most of the cadres at this mine are good, but a few made mistakes in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Some of the masses also joined the wrong factions and were misled. There was a significant gap between the mass organizations, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was once very tense. To strengthen unity and improve the relationship between superiors and subordinates, the revolutionary masses of the mine organized three-in-one combination Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They addressed the immediate thoughts of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary faction leaders, and revolutionary workers, organizing everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions with their problems in mind, and jointly criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. Before participating in the study class, Jiang Yongzheng, the former secretary of the East Pit Party Branch, had feelings of resentment and fear. Revolutionary worker Chu Shide addressed his immediate thoughts, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, having heart-to-heart talks, and patiently pointing out that the root cause of fearing the masses is the "private" character in his mind, creating a "wall" between him and the masses, and not fully recognizing his own mistakes. Chu Shide encouraged him to increase his courage, stand tall, and appear before the masses with a high posture, fighting against selfishness and revisionism together with the masses, and accepting everyone's help. Through everyone's patient help, Jiang Yongzheng deeply felt the concern and love of the revolutionary workers for the cadres, and his heart grew closer to the worker masses, reducing the ideological gap.

In the three-in-one combination study class, revolutionary faction members often heard the voices of the masses and received their help. After joining the leading cadre, service worker Tian Chuanxi had a tendency to detach from the masses, consulting less with the masses and making decisions subjectively. In the study class, revolutionary worker Zhang Linsheng sincerely criticized him face-to-face multiple times, which enlightened and educated Tian Chuanxi.

Revolutionary workers participating in the three-in-one combination study class not only helped the cadres but also educated themselves. Excavation worker Li Xue'an said: "In the past, I had an incomplete understanding of the cadres who made mistakes, wanting them all to step aside. Through study, I realized that most cadres are good and relatively good. They correct their mistakes and follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. This spirit is worth learning from."

    陶庄煤矿革命群众和革命干部，通过学习班学习，关系更加密切，感情更加融洽，大联合和三结合更加巩固，原因是：
    重视办三结合的学习班
    山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派，在驻矿解放军的大力帮助下，自去年九月份以来，集中办、业余办“三结合”学习班共四十九期，参加学习的干部、革命派负责人、革命群众三千余人。通过学习，绝大多数干部和群众觉悟迅速提高，感情更加融洽，大大促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    这个矿的绝大多数干部是好的，也有少数干部在文化大革命初期犯了错误。有部分群众也站错了队，受过蒙蔽。群众组织之间隔阂较大，干群关系一度很紧张。为了增强团结，密切上下级关系，这个矿的无产阶级革命派，举办了“三结合”的毛泽东思想学习班。针对革命干部、革命派负责人、革命职工的活思想，组织大家带着问题活学活用毛主席的最新指示，共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线的罪行。原东井党支部书记江永正，未参加学习班以前，有怨和怕的情绪。革命工人褚世德针对他的活思想，主动同他一起学习“老三篇”，一起谈心，并且耐心地向他指出，怕群众的根本原因是头脑里“私”字作怪，与群众之间心里有一道“墙”，对自己的错误认识不足。褚世德鼓励他要提高勇气，挺起腰杆，高姿态地到群众中去亮相，同群众一起斗私批修，接受大家的帮助。经大家的耐心帮助，江永正深深感到革命工人对干部的关心和爱护，和工人群众心贴近了，思想距离缩小了。
    在“三结合”学习班里，革命派服务员能经常听到群众的呼声，得到群众的帮助。服务员田传喜参加领导班子后，一度有脱离群众的现象，办事与群众商量少，自己主观地决定问题。在学习班里，革命工人张林生多次面对面地诚恳地批评他，田传喜受到启发和教育。
    革命工人参加“三结合”学习班，不仅帮助了干部，而且也教育了自己。掘进工人李学安说：“过去我对犯错误的干部认识不全面，恨不得要他们全部靠边站，通过学习，我认识到大多数干部是好的和比较好的，他们知错改错，紧跟毛主席闹革命，这种精神值得我们学习。”         时而思
