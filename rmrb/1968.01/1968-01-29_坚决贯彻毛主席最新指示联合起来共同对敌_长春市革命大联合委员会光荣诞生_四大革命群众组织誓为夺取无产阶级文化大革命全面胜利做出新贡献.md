In the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the two major factions and four revolutionary mass organizations in Changchun City, Jilin Province, have successfully achieved revolutionary great unity. On January 26, the Changchun City Revolutionary Great Unity Committee was established. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the red flag of Changbai Mountain and by the Songhua River, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of Changchun City, together with 150,000 people from the Jilin Provincial Military Region, troops stationed in Changchun, and military academies, braved temperatures of minus twenty degrees to hold a grand rally in the city center's People's Square to celebrate the glorious birth of the Changchun City Revolutionary Great Unity Committee.

The rally, amidst enthusiastic cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao.

Leaders from the Jilin Provincial Military Region and troops stationed in Changchun, including He Youfa, Ma Ning, Xu Zhongyu, Huang Sipei, Jia Bo, and Yao Tianlu, attended the rally.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the Jilin Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Changchun, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province and Changchun City, like the rest of the country, has a great and ever-improving situation. To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the brilliant year of 1968, the two major factions and four revolutionary mass organizations in Changchun City have, through serious study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary great unity.

The celebration rally began with the majestic song "The East is Red." The venue was filled with red flags, waves of songs, and the sound of drums echoing through the sky. The revolutionary masses of the two major factions and four revolutionary mass organizations, along with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, held high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, carried the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and stood shoulder to shoulder to participate in the rally. This fully demonstrated the proletarian revolutionaries' firm resolve to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and unite to fight the enemy, and showed the close unity between the military and the people, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the firm determination to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The rally was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, and people repeatedly raised their arms to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

Representatives from the two major factions and four revolutionary mass organizations in Changchun City, including "Changchun Commune," "Second Headquarters," "East is Red Commune," and "Red Revolutionary Committee," spoke at the rally. They unanimously expressed their determination to take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key link, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in their own units, promote revolution and production, and make new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In his speech, He Youfa, commander of the Jilin Provincial Military Region, on behalf of the provincial military region and the troops stationed in Changchun, extended the warmest congratulations and the most resolute support to the rally. He said, we must, with the greatest determination, the highest enthusiasm, and the fastest speed, in the shortest time, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the province. This is the most important combat task facing the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the province and the city. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key link, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and with great enthusiasm, continue to strive, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The rally received a telegram of congratulations from the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Command.
