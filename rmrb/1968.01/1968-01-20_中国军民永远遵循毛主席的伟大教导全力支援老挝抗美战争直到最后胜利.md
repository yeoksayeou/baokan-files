	On the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend warm congratulations to the Lao people, the Lao People's Liberation Army, and the Lao patriotic armed forces who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, you have united as one, fought together against the enemy, and demonstrated the immense power of people's war. You have annihilated a large number of the enemy's forces and achieved brilliant victories. Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." We firmly believe that you will definitely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, ultimately achieving the liberation of the entire nation.

	The peoples and armies of China and Laos have always been close comrades who share weal and woe. Your struggle is our struggle; your victory is our victory. We will always follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully supporting your just war of resistance against the U.S. and national salvation until final victory!

	May the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Laos last forever.
