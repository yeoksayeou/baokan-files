	Albanian Newspaper Strongly Condemns U.S.-Soviet Draft of Comprehensive "Non-Proliferation" Treaty
	U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists Collude to Play International Police
	China's Possession of Nuclear Weapons Greatly Boosts the Morale of the World's People and Diminishes the Arrogance of the Imperialists and Revisionists

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 21st - The editorial department of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on the 20th strongly condemning the draft of the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" jointly concocted by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and U.S. imperialism. The article pointed out that this draft is an important part of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Soviet-U.S. collusion to dominate the world and enslave the peoples of various countries.

	The article said, the U.S. and the Soviet Union attempt to use this treaty to consolidate their nuclear monopoly, "contain" China, shackle the peoples of various countries, and thus impose Soviet-U.S. hegemony on the peoples of the world. Such a treaty can only help U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique to play the dirty role of international police even more brazenly.

	After exposing the lies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism about their concern for disarmament and peace, the article said, their deceptive propaganda cannot fool the peoples of various countries, nor can it cover up the new conspiracies of the hegemonic policies of the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Faced with this situation, the interests of the peoples of various countries require them to strengthen their defensive forces, heighten their vigilance, and prepare to strike back at any aggressor.

	The article said, the peoples of various countries who love freedom and all revolutionary forces opposing imperialism welcome the socialist power, the People's Republic of China, which loves peace and has mastered the atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, and missiles. The People's Republic of China's possession of these weapons has inspired the struggle of the peoples of various countries and broken the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

	The editorial of the Albanian newspaper "Unity" on the 21st pointed out that the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is primarily aimed at the great bulwark of world peace and socialism—the People's Republic of China. They have tried their best to obstruct China from mastering nuclear weapons, but this conspiracy has shamefully failed. Today, China has become a socialist power with advanced economy, technology, and science. It possesses thermonuclear weapons and is continuously developing and improving them for the benefit of defending peace and the progressive people of the whole world. The nuclear weapons in the hands of the great Chinese people are a great inspiration to the peoples and revolutionary forces of the world and a heavy blow to the evil conspiracies of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

	The article concluded, "The 'Non-Proliferation Treaty' will further expose to the peoples of the world that the imperialists and revisionists are the enemies of the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries and the enemies of peace.

    阿报强烈谴责美苏合伙炮制所谓“防止核扩散”条约全面草案
    美帝苏修狼狈为奸充当国际宪兵
    中国掌握核武器大长世界人民志气大灭帝修威风
    新华社地拉那二十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十日发表编辑部文章，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约的全面草案。文章指出，这个草案是苏美勾结主宰世界、奴役各国人民的反革命阴谋的重要组成部分。
    文章说，苏美企图通过这一条约来巩固它们的核垄断，“遏制”中国，束缚各国人民的手脚，从而把苏美霸权强加于世界人民。这样的条约只能帮助美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团更加肆无忌惮地扮演国际宪兵的肮脏角色。
    文章在揭露了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的所谓关心裁军与和平的谎言后说，它们的欺骗宣传骗不了各国人民，也掩盖不了苏美两大国霸权政策的新阴谋。面临这一形势，各国人民的利益要求各国人民加强他们的防卫力量，提高警惕和准备给任何侵略者以回击。
    文章说，爱好自由的各国人民和一切反对帝国主义的革命力量欢呼爱好和平的社会主义强国中华人民共和国掌握了原子弹、氢弹和导弹。中华人民共和国掌握了这些武器，鼓舞了各国人民的斗争，打破了美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的核垄断。
    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十一日发表评论员文章指出，苏美合伙策划的“防止核扩散”条约，首先是针对世界和平与社会主义的强大堡垒——中华人民共和国。他们曾经竭力阻挠中国掌握核武器，但是这一阴谋可耻地破产了。今天，中国已经成为一个具有先进经济、技术和科学的社会主义强国。她掌握热核武器，并在不断地发展和完善它，以有利于保卫和平，有利于全世界进步人类。伟大的中国人民手中的核武器是对全世界人民和革命力量的巨大鼓舞，是对帝、修、反可恶阴谋的沉重打击。
    文章最后说，“防止核扩散”条约将进一步在全世界人民面前暴露帝国主义者和修正主义者是各国人民自由和独立的敌人，是和平的敌人。
