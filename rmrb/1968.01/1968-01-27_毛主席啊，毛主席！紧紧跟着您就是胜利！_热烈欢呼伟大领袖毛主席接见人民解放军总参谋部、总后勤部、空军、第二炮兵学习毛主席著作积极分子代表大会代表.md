Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Clinging to You Is Victory!

	Warmly Celebrating the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Reception of Representatives from the PLA General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps at the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works

	The brightest, reddest sun has risen!

	The most joyous, most thrilling moment has arrived!

	Our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vigor, waves his mighty hand guiding the revolutionary ship to victory, walking briskly among the soldiers with his closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and other central leaders!

	"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

	"Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!"

	Millions of hearts are pounding fiercely, millions of smiling faces facing the red sun. The boundless loyal shouts to Chairman Mao shake the five continents and resonate through the heavens!

	On the afternoon of January 26, 1968, what a memorable moment! The representatives of the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works from the PLA General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps gathered in the Great Hall of the People, their hearts surging with emotion, their blood boiling. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We have longed day and night to see you. Today, in the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have received us. This is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, the greatest spur, and the greatest happiness for the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country who are implementing your series of latest instructions and striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Our love for you is the deepest! The deepest! The deepest!

	The sky is not as high as Chairman Mao's genius!

	The Milky Way is not as long as Chairman Mao's kindness!

	The stars are not as numerous as Chairman Mao's contributions to the people!

	The ocean is not as deep as our love for Chairman Mao!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, personally nurtured by you, love you dearly. Whether they are fighting on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," or guarding the frontiers by the sea; whether they are soaring in the sky in fighter jets or racing across plateaus and grasslands in cars; whether they are working in the mountains with iron arms or diligently fighting in offices, factories, stations, and hospitals... the hearts of the soldiers are always with you.

	On the flying battlefield, heroic air force soldiers shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" as they take off, using your teachings to guide the battle, and hanging your badge high in the cockpit. The soldiers say: Shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" as we take off gives us strength; thinking of your teachings in battle, we fear no difficulties; looking up at the red sun in the cockpit, we navigate through clouds and fog without getting lost. Fearless high-altitude hunters and battle heroes like Dong Xiaohai and his comrades in his squadron, filled with love for you, relying on a heart that loves and is loyal to you without bounds, resolutely carry out your instruction to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy." No matter whether the enemy comes from high altitudes, low altitudes, clear skies, or rainy skies, they are all shot down and destroyed, with no chance of return. They have created a glorious record of shooting down and damaging fourteen enemy planes. Dong Xiaohai, a poor child from the old society who used to pick up scraps, has been received by you six times. Today, he stands by your side again. The scenes of you working tirelessly for the revolution of all Chinese and all revolutionary people around the world over the decades appear before his eyes again. He is moved to tears: Dear Chairman Mao, we love you dearly, forever love you, love you for generations!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers of a certain unit of the Second Artillery Corps, with hearts of red and bones of steel, fighting in the south and north of the motherland, hang your portrait high in the construction site and carry your little red book with them, adding boundless strength. In an accident where a thousand-pound boulder collapsed, Qu Junshen, trapped underneath, encouraged his comrades rescuing him in the moment of life and death, saying: "With Mao Zedong Thought, I can endure it!" The more than four thousand officers and soldiers of a certain unit, to express their boundless love for you, have stitched a banner with the words "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life" with needle and thread. Each stitch and thread embodies such deep class feelings! Today, the representatives of this unit see you, and they, on behalf of all their comrades, shout a thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The love of a hundred million people singing together cannot express our boundless love for you. The soldiers of the 10th Company of the Construction Engineering Department of the General Logistics Department, Chairman Mao's good soldiers, see you again today, which is the happy moment they have longed for day and night. He rescued a train and was seriously injured. When he woke up from unconsciousness, the first words he said were "Long live Chairman Mao," the first song he sang was "The East Is Red," the first three big characters he wrote were "Chairman Mao," and the first saying he recited was "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." His first wish when coming to Beijing was to see you. Today, your reception has given him immense encouragement and strength. He shouts to you over and over again: Dear Chairman Mao, you are the soul of our lives, the source of our strength, and the beacon of our progress.

	In the thin air and ice-covered highlands of the Kaiji La military post, all the soldiers love you dearly, their hearts turning to the red sun. Today, their representative sees you and proudly says: We take root in the snowy highlands, all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The outstanding cadres nurtured by your brilliant thoughts, such as the director of the office of a certain unit of the General Staff Department, Liang Zhenyou, are representatives of the countless soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who love you dearly and are models for countless revolutionary cadres! For more than twenty years, he has loved you dearly, devoted himself to the people, and done everything for the revolution. In defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by you, to rescue the revolutionary youngsters swept away by the flood, he heroically sacrificed his life. Today, his comrades receive your reception and express to you: We will definitely love you dearly like Comrade Liang Zhenyou and follow you in revolution forever.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers love you the most. From the old Red Army who followed you in battles north and south to the new soldiers who have grown up in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, today, everyone is ecstatic and sings aloud. They say: Dear Chairman Mao, you personally created the great Communist Party of China, you personally created the great People's Liberation Army, and you personally created New China. Only your brilliant thoughts can save China and the world. After receiving the reception from Chairman Mao, the "Model of Love for Soldiers" Wang Yuchang said excitedly: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! All the beautiful words in the world combined cannot express our boundless love for you. We are proud of our boundless love for you and proud of our boundless loyalty to you. We will definitely let your thoughts shine brightly around the world and forever!"

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions are the most powerful! The most powerful! The most powerful!

	Fighter jets have compasses to navigate through clouds and fog without getting lost; we have your latest instructions to guide us in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, so we can brave the storms and waves and march towards victory forever.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions are the great blueprint for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every step forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the result of implementing your latest instructions. Where your latest instructions are implemented, there is victory.

	The red flag of supporting the left, in the Beijing Knitting Factory, the representative of the 8341st Unit, Gu Yuanxing, is especially moved today to receive your reception. With tears of happiness, he says: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Water has a source, trees have roots, your latest instructions are the soul of our work supporting the left. Every victory we achieve in the Beijing Knitting Factory is a victory of your latest instructions. Glory to the great leader Chairman Mao, glory to the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	In the Tianjin Hongwei District, the air force unit quickly implements your latest instructions, firmly follows your latest instructions without wavering, and implements your latest instructions without distortion. This supporting unit has only 148 comrades, executing supporting tasks in a region with more than 500,000 people and more than 300 factories. How? It is all thanks to the immense power of your latest instructions, relying on giving your latest instructions to the masses, relying on the masses' conscious actions to thoroughly implement your latest instructions. Their representative today sees you and says: Your latest instructions are the treasure of revolution, wherever they are used, they are effective. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Hongwei District has achieved one glorious victory after another, all thanks to your latest instructions.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The power of your latest instructions is boundless, wherever they shine, there is red. The soldiers of the 7th Company of a certain unit of the Second Artillery Corps firmly remember your great teaching of "mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses," enthusiastically propagating your latest instructions to the broad masses in the local area, letting the red sun rise high in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants in remote mountain villages, turning the backward "mud fortress" into an advanced "red flag fortress." Today, the representative of this company sees you, bringing the most sincere greetings from all the soldiers and the most heartfelt wishes from the poor and lower-middle peasants of the "red flag fortress." They express their determination to take the propagation of your latest instructions as the most glorious and important political task, making every step red, making every place red, and letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high wherever they go.

	The representative of the 3516th Factory, a red flag in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the logistics front, sees the red sun in his heart, Chairman Mao, today, and reviews the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saying excitedly: We can achieve revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and gain double victories in revolution and production, all because we have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism with proletarian party spirit. Every victory we achieve in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a victory of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions are the most powerful ideological weapon. Those armed with your latest instructions are the greatest fighting force. The broad officers and soldiers firmly on their posts, resolutely implementing your latest instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," fiercely strike the enemy and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The air force unit stationed in Guangxi, carrying your instructions into the sky, commanding battles with your instructions, achieved three victories in three battles in 1967, shooting down five invading American aggressor planes in eight days. They say: Chairman Mao waves his hand to point the way, overcoming all difficulties without obstacles, the eagle strikes the sky without enemies, soaring to the ninth heaven to annihilate the wolves.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" greatly inspires and urges the broad officers and soldiers of our army. The logistics soldiers stationed in the south and north of the motherland, taking Nian Siyang as an example, cherish the country in their hearts and look at the world with open eyes, devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution. The engineering troops fighting in the deep mountains and steep cliffs regard every shovel and pickaxe as firing at China's Khrushchev and digging the grave of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. The officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" are determined to temper themselves in the great winds and waves of class struggle, to "face the wind and rain and see the world," thoroughly reform their worldview, and build a great wall of "publicness" in their minds. The broad officers and soldiers say: If "self" does not fall, the country is difficult to defend; if "revisionism" is not criticized, capitalism will restore; criticizing and repudiating revisionism, socialism will last for thousands of generations and will never change color.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your thoughts are higher than mountains, deeper than oceans, and brighter than the sun; your latest instructions are all truths, and every word shines with gold. Among countless instructions, implementing your latest instructions is the first. Among countless victories, implementing your latest instructions is the greatest victory.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!

	We follow your revolutionary line the closest!

	The closest! The closest!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers closely follow you, forever advancing along the revolutionary course you point out, not deviating by an inch or a step! With your wise command and the correct guidance of your revolutionary line, our army has grown from nothing to something, from weak to strong, becoming an unparalleled, most powerful revolutionary army. Today, you come to our side, how can we not be moved and shed tears of joy! Your care and concern for revolutionary soldiers are beyond measure, beyond the vast sea and the boundless sky!

	The old Red Army soldiers attending the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works from the General Staff Department and General Logistics Department are especially moved today. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they follow your teaching of "not eating old capital! Creating new merits" and learn and apply your brilliant thoughts actively, firmly defending your revolutionary line and creating new merits for the people. Now, they see you, and the decades of battle courses they have walked with you appear before their eyes. They recall the unforgettable scenes of you leading them to climb the snow mountains during the Long March. At that time, you led the Red Army soldiers to climb the mountain top, warmly waving to everyone and encouraging them to advance. The Red Army soldiers, under your encouragement, made a firm vow: "Closely following Chairman Mao, do not fall behind! Closely following Chairman Mao is victory!" For decades, on the tortuous revolutionary journey, the Red Army soldiers have closely followed you, overcome "left" and "right" opportunism, braved one difficulty after another, crossed one stormy wave after another, and won one great victory after another. Today, the Red Army soldiers again closely follow your great strategic deployment and achieve decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your proletarian revolutionary line is the most correct, the most revolutionary, and the most thorough! Closely following you is happiness, is light, is victory! The Red Army soldiers will definitely follow you generation after generation, with unshakable resolve!

	Chairman Mao comes to the air force representatives, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" resounds louder and louder. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The air force soldiers have always grown up under your warm care. At every critical moment in the construction of the air force, it is you who point out the most correct direction and give the most brilliant instructions. China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have tried every means to promote the bourgeois military line, attempting to lead the young air force astray. We follow your teachings, thoroughly smashing their plots, and firmly advancing along your line of building the army. Today, the three commanders of the "Heroic Aviation Regiment" come to your side. They look at you affectionately, and a thousand words surge in their hearts: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The red sun's light shines over the world, the lighthouse's light illuminates the distant horizon; your brilliant military thoughts illuminate our people's army's construction path red. We will definitely pass on your brilliant thoughts from generation to generation, occupy every inch of the spiritual battlefield, and guide every inch of the combat flight course!"

	The representative from a certain military horse farm on the windy and snowy grasslands, seeing our eternal red sun, says excitedly: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers on the grasslands think of you day and night, their hearts are infinitely loyal to you. We resolutely implement your brilliant "May 7th Directive." You teach us to "study politics, study military affairs, study culture," so we firmly walk the path of emphasizing politics. You teach us to "criticize the bourgeoisie," so we fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev. You teach us that "military, agriculture, industry, and civilian affairs can all be combined," so we start farming in the place where "snow falls in June and frost falls in August." The representatives attending the reception express their determination to forever follow your brilliant instructions, bravely forge ahead, and turn our army into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! At the time of achieving complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the representatives of the revolutionary factions from the General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps solemnly declare to you: We will definitely thoroughly criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, eliminate all their poisonous influences, and defend you with our lives, defend your brilliant thoughts and your revolutionary line, forever advancing in the direction you point out!

	The famous active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, Feng Fusheng, and the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, and Second Artillery Corps, Wang Shichuan, Hou Chaowen, Zhang Mingjiu, and Gong Picheng, seeing you, are overwhelmed with happiness and excitement, expressing: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We can firmly advance along the revolutionary course you point out, all thanks to learning and applying your brilliant thoughts actively. Vice Chairman Lin Biao calls for launching a mass movement to study your great works in the entire army, setting a brilliant example for the entire party and the country. Vice Chairman Lin has always high-held your brilliant red flag, most loyally, most resolutely, and most thoroughly executing, propagating, and defending your great thoughts and revolutionary line. We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example, forever high-holding your brilliant red flag, learning and applying your great works actively, closely following you, and advancing from victory to victory!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!

	We are the most loyal to you! The most loyal! The most loyal!

	What a happy, joyous, and boiling night! The thousands of representatives receiving Chairman Mao's reception are immersed in boundless joy, with surging happiness in their hearts. Countless letters of determination and guarantees are handed to the leaders; countless enthusiastic letters and telegrams are sent to all directions. Every heart turns to the red sun, with countless words expressing a common vow: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The revolutionary soldiers personally nurtured by you are forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line.

	The representative of the 7350th Unit, who has made outstanding achievements in "three supports, two militaries," after receiving your reception, holds an all-night discussion, determining to take your reception as the starting point for achieving new victories. The unit praised as the "Red Propaganda Station in Siming Mountain" has unlimited loyalty to your latest instructions. They brave the wind and rain, traverse mountains and rivers, covering half the county, timely spreading your voice to every household. They express their determination to be models in learning, implementing, propagating, and defending your latest instructions.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Loyalty to your brilliant thoughts is our highest duty, and implementing your latest instructions is our most sacred task. The representative of a certain unit of the General Staff Department, Zhao Zengfa, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, with unbounded loyalty to you, bravely defends your proletarian revolutionary line. Today, Zhao Zengfa says passionately: Dear Chairman Mao, whoever supports you, I am with them; whoever opposes you, I will fight them! We defend your revolutionary line, unshakable in great winds and waves, unchanging in the drying of rivers and the crumbling of rocks.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We are loyal to you, which means closely following you and doing everything according to your instructions. The revolutionary soldiers you have educated have only the red sun in their hearts, daring to face mountain collapses and earth tremors. The 3rd Battalion of the Motor Transport Unit of the General Logistics Department implements your great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," racing across the plateau, often passing through dangerous areas with frequent collapses. Difficulties and dangers cannot stop the plateau motor transport troops. To ensure the completion of transportation tasks, Deputy Political Instructor Li Xianwen and ten comrades bravely enter the dangerous areas to explore the path, unfortunately encountering a rare mountain collapse, and ten comrades sacrifice their lives. The representative of this motor transport unit sees you today and is greatly encouraged, expressing their determination to be like the ten martyrs, fighting for the defense of Mao Zedong Thought in life and sacrificing for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We are infinitely loyal to you, with unshakable resolve for generations. Zhang Sanhuai of a certain unit of the Second Artillery Corps, with a heart of red for the great leader Chairman Mao, has been diligently following your instructions for twenty years, being a good worker for six consecutive years. Today, seeing Chairman Mao, he says excitedly: Dear Chairman Mao, I will forever listen to your words, closely follow you, be loyal to you for life, and follow you in revolution for life.

	"In every matter, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao!" This is the iron-clad vow of Chairman Mao's good soldier, Yang Ziyun. He, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the critical moment of an oil tank fire, bravely rushed into the fire, using his body to block the fire mouth. His burns have not healed, but hearing about China's Khrushchev opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, he endures the pain to carve on his cane with a knife: "Chairman Mao, I defend you with my life! Down with China's Khrushchev!" Today, after receiving your reception, Yang Ziyun writes another iron-clad vow: "In every matter, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao!" This is also the iron-clad vow of the broad officers and soldiers of the entire army.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The river is not as deep as our love for you; the sky is not as vast as the power of your latest instructions; nothing is as good as your revolutionary line; no matter how difficult and dangerous, our red hearts for you will never change!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Your reception has given us boundless strength. We are infinitely loyal to you, forever loyal to you! We solemnly declare to you: In the brilliant year of 1968, we will most resolutely take Vice Chairman Lin Biao as a brilliant example, higher hold your brilliant red flag, closely follow your great strategic deployment, thoroughly implement your latest instructions, and in the battle to achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Infinitely loyal to you, closely following you is victory!

    后勤战线执行毛主席最新指示的一面红旗三五一六工厂的代表，今天见到了心中最红的红太阳毛主席，回顾了无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，无比兴奋地说：我们能实现革命的大联合，革命的三结合，获得革命、生产双胜利，就是因为坚决执行了毛主席的一系列最新指示，用无产阶级党性克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的结果。我们在无产阶级文化大革命中的每一个胜利，都是毛主席的最新指示的胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的最新指示是最强大的思想武器。用您的最新指示武装起来的人就是最大的战斗力。坚守在战斗岗位上的广大指战员，坚决执行您“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的最新指示，狠狠地打击敌人，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。驻广西地区空军部队，带着您的指示上天，用您的指示指挥作战，一九六七年三战三捷，八天中击落了入侵的美国强盗飞机五架。他们说：毛主席挥手指航向，千难万险无阻挡，鹰击长空全无敌，直上九天灭豺狼。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，极大地鼓舞和鞭策着我军广大指战员，驻守祖国天南海北的后勤战士，以年四旺为榜样，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，一心一意为革命，冰山雪岭献丹心。战斗在深山峻岭的工程部队，身在山沟心想毛主席。把挖一锹刨一镐都看作是向中国赫鲁晓夫开火，看作是给帝修反挖掘坟墓。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，决心在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，“经风雨，见世面”，彻底改造世界观，在头脑中筑起“公”字的长城。广大指战员说：“私”字不倒，江山难保；
  “修”字不批，资本主义复辟；斗私批修，社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的思想高过山岳，深过海洋，比太阳还明亮；您的最新指示，句句是真理，字字闪金光。千条万条，执行您的最新指示是第一条。千胜利，万胜利，落实您的最新指示就是最大的胜利。
        毛主席啊，毛主席！
    您的革命路线我们跟得最紧！
            最紧！最紧！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！革命战士紧紧跟随您，永远沿着您指引的革命航道前进，一分一度不偏离！有了您的英明统帅，有了您的革命路线的正确指引，我军才从无到有，从弱到强，成为一支举世无双的最强大的革命军队。今天，您老人家来到了我们身旁，我们怎能不心潮激荡热泪淌！您老人家对革命战士的爱护和关怀啊，千顷碧海容不下，万里苍空也难装！
    出席总参谋部、总后勤部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的老红军战士，今天特别激动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们遵循您老人家“不要吃老本！要立新功”的伟大教导，活学活用您的光辉思想，坚决捍卫您的革命路线，又为人民立下了新功。现在，他们见到了您老人家，几十年来跟随您走过的战斗历程，又展现在面前。他们回忆起长征途中您带领大家爬雪山时的难忘情景。那时，您带领红军战士向山顶攀登，亲切地向大家招手，鼓励大家前进。红军战士在您的鼓励下，发出坚定的誓言：“紧紧跟着毛主席，不要掉队！紧紧跟着毛主席，就是胜利！”几十年来，在艰苦曲折的革命征途上，红军战士正是紧紧跟随您，战胜了“左”右倾机会主义，闯过了一个个艰难险阻，越过了一道道惊涛骇浪，赢得了一个个伟大胜利。今天，红军战士又紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。毛主席啊，毛主席！您的无产阶级革命路线最正确，最革命，最彻底！紧紧跟着您，就是幸福，就是光明，就是胜利！红军战士一定要世世代代紧跟您，千秋万载志不移！
    毛主席来到了空军代表们面前，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声，一浪高过一浪。毛主席啊，毛主席！空军战士一直在您的亲切关怀下成长。在空军建设的每个关键时刻，都是您老人家指出最正确的方向，作出最英明的指示。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，千方百计地推行资产阶级军事路线，妄图把年轻的空军引向邪路，我们遵照您的教导，彻底粉碎了他们的阴谋，坚定地沿着您老人家的建军路线前进。今天，威震长空的“航空兵英雄中队”的三任中队长，一起来到了您的身边，他们亲切地望着您，千言万语涌心头：“毛主席啊，毛主席！太阳红光映天下，灯塔光照万里明；您的光辉建军思想啊，把我们人民军队的建军道路照得红彤彤！我们一定要把您老人家的光辉思想代代相传，占领灵魂的每一分阵地，指引战斗飞行的每一寸航程！”

    我们对您最忠！最忠！最忠！
    这是多么幸福、多么欢乐、多么沸腾的夜晚啊！接受毛主席接见的数千名代表，沉浸在无比欢乐的海洋里，人人心中翻滚着幸福的热流。无数张决心书、保证书，送到首长手里；无数封热情洋溢的书信和电报，飞向四面八方。颗颗红心向着红太阳，千言万语表达一个共同的誓言：毛主席啊，毛主席！您亲手哺育的革命战士永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。
    在“三支”“两军”中做出了显著成绩的七三五○部队的代表受到您的接见后，连夜座谈，决心把您的接见，作为夺取新的胜利的起点。这个部队被赞为“四明山区红色宣传站”的某部十二连，无限忠于您的最新指示，他们顶风冒雨，跋山涉水走遍大半个县，把您的声音及时传播到千家万户。他们表示，一定要做学习、执行、宣传、捍卫您的最新指示的模范。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！忠于您的光辉思想是我们最高的天职，落实您的最新指示是我们最神圣的任务。总参谋部某部代表赵增发在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，怀着对您的无限忠诚，以最大的勇敢，捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线。今天，赵增发满怀激情地说：敬爱的毛主席，谁拥护您，我就和谁亲；谁反对您，我就和谁拚！我们捍卫您的革命路线，大风大浪不动摇，海枯石烂不变心。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们忠于您，就是要紧紧跟着您，处处按照您的指示办事。您教育出来的革命战士，心中只有红太阳，山崩地裂也敢上。总后勤部汽车某部三营执行您的“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，奔驰在高原上，经常通过不断塌方的险区。艰难险阻，挡不住高原汽车兵。为了保证胜利完成运输任务，副教导员李显文等十位同志，冒着生命危险，深入险区探路，不幸遇到罕见的大山崩，十位同志壮烈牺牲。这个汽车部队的代表今天见到您，受到极大鼓舞，他们表示，要象十位烈士那样，生为捍卫毛泽东思想而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们无限忠于您，千秋万载志不移。第二炮兵某部张三怀同志，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，二十年如一日，坚守在平凡的工作岗位上，老老实实按照您的指示办事，连续六年被评为“五好”职工。今天，他见到了毛主席，激动地说：敬爱的毛主席，我要永远听您的话，紧紧跟着您，一辈子忠于您老人家，一辈子跟着您老人家干革命。
      “一事当前，无限忠于毛主席！”这是毛主席的好战士杨梓云的钢铁誓言。他为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，在油罐失火的危急时刻，奋身扑向火海，用身体堵住火口。他的烧伤还没有痊愈，一听到中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，就忍痛握刀，在自己的手杖上一刀一刀刻下了几个大字：
  “毛主席，我用生命保卫您！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”今天，杨梓云受到您的接见后，又一次写下钢铁誓言：“一事当前，无限忠于毛主席！”这也是全军广大指战员的钢铁誓言。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！河深海深，没有我们对您老人家的热爱深；天大地大，没有您老人家最新指示的威力大；千好万好，没有您老人家的革命路线好；千难万险，我们忠于您老人家的红心永不变！
