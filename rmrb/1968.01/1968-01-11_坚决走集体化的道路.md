    Resolutely Take the Road of Collectivization

    The 7350th Unit's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at Jiubao Commune, Zhang Xiangdong

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "The agricultural cooperative movement, from the very beginning, has been a serious struggle of ideas and politics." Every step forward that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Jiubao Commune take on the socialist collectivization path has been a serious struggle between two classes and two lines.

    Jiubao Commune processes 900,000 pieces of hemp cloth for the state each year, earning over 500,000 yuan in processing fees alone, which accounts for 40% of the commune's total sideline income. Such an important sideline production should naturally be collectively operated, but until 1966, hemp cloth processing was still done individually.

    During China's three years of temporary difficulties, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiubao Commune responded resolutely to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, relying on the collective strength of the people's commune, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm for collective production, and rapidly restoring and developing agricultural and sideline production. The poor and lower-middle peasants urgently demanded that hemp cloth processing be collectively operated. However, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who were then in power, spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract," claiming that "agriculture should also retreat, including production to the household and individual farming." A small handful of capitalist roaders within the local Party also parroted, saying, "Hemp cloth processing is done individually because it is the demand of the commune members; do not rush to include it in collective operations." What was even more infuriating was that when the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Chaoyang Production Brigade discussed and voluntarily took the initiative to change hemp cloth processing to collective operation, they sent a work team to force the commune members to revert the hemp cloth processing, which had already been included in the collective economy, back to individual operation. This was truly despicable!

    Processing hemp cloth individually meant that raw materials were distributed according to the amount of labor each household had, so households with more labor power received a large amount of raw materials, while households with less labor power, more people, and heavier burdens received very few raw materials. As a result, some well-off peasants increased their income, while the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants saw their income decrease. Some well-off peasants could not process all the raw materials themselves, so they sold the raw materials at high prices to the poor and lower-middle peasants, exploiting them.

    Due to individual operation, the 500,000 yuan in processing fees each year all went to the individual income of the commune members, with the collective either not contributing to the public accumulation or contributing very little, thus weakening the collective economy.

    Ironclad facts prove that individual operation can only lead us from the road of agricultural collectivization to the capitalist path!

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without agricultural collectivization, there can be no complete and consolidated socialism." In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiubao Commune finally included hemp cloth processing in the collective economic track. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

    坚决走集体化的道路
    七三五○部队驻九堡公社毛泽东思想宣传队　张向东
    毛主席教导我们：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”九堡公社广大贫下中农和革命干部在社会主义集体化的大道上每前进一步，都经历了一场严重的两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。
    九堡公社每年要为国家加工土麻布九十多万匹，单加工费就有五十多万元，占全公社副业总收入的百分之四十。这样一项十分重要的副业生产，本应该集体经营，但是，直到一九六六年，土麻布的加工仍然还是单干。
    在我国三年暂时困难时期，九堡公社广大贫下中农坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，依靠人民公社的集体力量，充分发挥集体生产积极性，迅速恢复和发展农副业生产。贫下中农迫切要求把土麻布加工归集体经营。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却大刮“三自一包”的黑风，胡说什么：“农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干”。本地区党内一小撮走资派也鹦鹉学舌，说什么“土麻布加工单干是社员的要求，不要急于纳入集体”。令人更加气愤的是，当朝阳大队贫下中农经过讨论，自动起来把土麻布加工改为集体经营时，他们竟派工作组，强迫社员把已经纳入集体经济的土麻布加工又改成单干。真是可恨之极！
    加工土麻布搞单干，原料是根据劳力多少按户分配的，这样，就使劳力多的富裕农民分到大量原料，而劳力少、人口多、负担重的贫下中农却很少分到原料。结果是一些富裕农民增加了收入，而广大贫下中农的收入减少了。有的富裕农民自己加工不完，就把原料高价转卖给贫下中农，使贫下中农受到剥削。
    由于单干，每年五十多万元加工费全部归社员私人收入，集体不提公共积累或少提公共积累，削弱了集体经济。
    铁的事实证明，单干，只能把我们从农业集体化道路引向资本主义邪路！
    毛主席教导我们：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，九堡公社广大贫下中农终于把土麻布加工纳入了集体经济轨道。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
