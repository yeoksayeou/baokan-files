In the midst of the nationwide celebration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the triumphant march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary little red guards of the schools in Wuhan, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and officially established the Wuhan Region Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards High School and Middle School Representatives' Conference, achieving the great unity of the revolutionary organizations of the red guards throughout the city. This is another victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On January 15, 50,000 revolutionary little red guards and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan region held a grand rally to celebrate the glorious birth of the Wuhan Region Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards High School and Middle School Representatives' Conference and to enthusiastically hail the achievement of the great unity of the revolutionary red guards in the Wuhan region.

The State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the Wuhan Region Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards High School and Middle School Representatives' Conference. When the telegram was read at the conference, the entire audience erupted in cheers, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting in unison, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The leaders of the Wuhan Military Region, including Zhang Yuhua, Xiong Qiying, Liu Feng, Xu Guofu, and the leaders of the Wuhan Air Force, Wuhan Garrison, and Hubei Military Region, including Xiao Qian, Fang Ming, and Zhang Hong, attended the conference.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the little red guards of the Wuhan region have closely followed Chairman Mao, closely followed Mao Zedong Thought, and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to smash the bourgeois reactionary line, in the revolutionary criticism and rectification of Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Renhe in the Wuhan region, and in the struggle-criticism-transformation within their own units, they have achieved one victory after another, establishing immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary red guards and revolutionary student organizations must achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they must achieve revolutionary great unity under the revolutionary principle." Chairman Mao's teachings are like a red sun illuminating the path forward for the little red guards. They swiftly launched a wave of achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the city's high schools and middle schools. Through self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, they eliminated various disturbances, leaving no hiding place for class enemies and making bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism stink to high heaven. They greatly enhanced proletarian party spirit and powerfully promoted revolutionary great unity. Currently, the vast majority of high schools and middle schools in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity by school and by class, and most schools have established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination.

The conference began with the stirring melody of "The East Is Red." The conference chairman, in his opening remarks, reviewed the battle journey of the Wuhan red guards over the past year and more. He then pointed out that after the establishment of the Wuhan Region High School and Middle School Revolutionary Representatives' Conference, we must, in the new year, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and widely, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively respond to Chairman Mao's call for a proletarian educational revolution, and strive to achieve new victories in the struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the educational revolution for the people.

Commander Zhang Siyu of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army addressed the conference. He called on the Wuhan red guards to, in the new year, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without any deviation. He called on them to strengthen proletarian party spirit, smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The leaders of the Wuhan Air Force, Wuhan Garrison, and Hubei Military Region, including Xiao Qian, Fang Ming, Zhang Hong, and the representatives of the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Conference Temporary Committee and the representatives from specialized and county levels, also spoke at the conference, expressing their warm congratulations and firm support for the conference.
