	New Zealand Youth Protest Against U.S. Warships in Wellington

	A group of New Zealand youth recently held a demonstration to strongly protest the arrival of two U.S. warships in Wellington that had been involved in the Vietnam War.

	The two warships, the "Constellation" and the "Frank Knox," had sailed from South Vietnam to Wellington for a "vacation." The protesting youth set up picket lines at the docks, holding up signs denouncing U.S. aggression in Vietnam and demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and New Zealand troops from South Vietnam. The youth also exposed to the citizens of Wellington the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam War.

	Philippine People Demonstrate Against U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

	Over a thousand citizens of Manila held a demonstration on the 23rd to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and to condemn the Philippine government for acting as a U.S. lackey in the aggression against Vietnam.

	The demonstrators angrily burned an effigy of U.S. President Johnson, with a sign around its neck reading "murderer." They shouted anti-U.S. slogans. Their banners read, "Johnson is the Hitler of our time!" "Victory to the Vietnamese people!" They also distributed leaflets demanding that the Philippine government immediately withdraw its 2,000 engineers sent to South Vietnam to serve as U.S. cannon fodder.

	The demonstration was attended by many Philippine workers, peasants, students, and patriotic religious organizations.

	Colombian Soda Workers Strike

	Nearly three thousand workers at the Postobón soda factory in Colombia's Valle del Cauca Department went on strike starting December 27, strongly protesting the management's refusal to increase wages and the deprivation of workers' living benefits.

	The Postobón soda factory is one of the largest soda monopolies in Colombia. The U.S. International Beverage Company holds 40% of the shares in this soda factory.

	The strike at the soda factory came after a three-month-long negotiation and struggle between the workers and the management. This strike affected 80% of the soda market supply in Colombia.
