In the past ten days, with Sasebo as the center, people from all over Japan have launched fierce anti-American patriotic struggles, opposing the docking of the American nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and other nuclear ships in Sasebo. This struggle has achieved a brilliant victory, indicating that the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, with the revolutionary left as its core, is advancing along the road to victory.

	The U.S.-Japan reactionaries are paper tigers

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really the decisive factor in history."

	The reactionary and traitorous Sato government of Japan, on the one hand, sells out the interests of the Japanese nation by bringing American nuclear ships into the port of Sasebo; on the other hand, it is extremely afraid of the struggle of the Japanese people against the docking of the "Enterprise." Before the "Enterprise" entered the port of Sasebo, it mobilized 5,800 armed police, more than 2,000 plainclothes agents, 280 water cannons, armored cars, and various police cars from 27 prefectures nationwide to Sasebo, which has a population of only 250,000. At the same time, it openly used fascist laws similar to those used by Japanese militarists during the war to carry out so-called "preventive arrests" nationwide. According to the Japanese police authorities themselves, from January 10 to 21, nearly 500 patriotic students and workers were arrested nationwide.

	The Sato government was particularly afraid of the people of Sasebo and people from all over the country uniting, especially the patriotic students from Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and other places going to Sasebo to participate in the struggle.

	On January 15, the Sato government dispatched a large number of armed police to Tokyo and arbitrarily arrested 131 patriotic students who were preparing to go to Sasebo.

	In Fukuoka, the reactionary police, in collusion with the revisionist group led by Miyamoto, tried their best to prevent students from Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto from staying at Kyushu University and blocked the stations for several days to prevent students from boarding trains to Sasebo.

	The Sasebo station was filled with armed police and plainclothes agents. Every time a train arrived, these reactionary police agents would panic, widen their eyes, and try to identify patriotic students from among the passengers.

	However, the anti-American patriotic tide could not be stopped by these reactionary police agents. On the morning of January 17, more than 1,000 young students from Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka traveled a long distance, broke through the enemy's savage suppression and one blockade after another, and finally arrived at the front line of the struggle in Sasebo.

	They avoided the police-filled station exits, followed the U.S. military's dedicated railway line, and marched toward the U.S. military base, shouting anti-American slogans angrily. Near the base at the Hirase Bridge, they were suppressed by armed police who outnumbered them by more than two to one. However, the brave young students advanced against the water jets from the water cannons and tear gas, persistently fighting against the reactionary police. Suddenly, a young man unfurled a flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and shouted, "Charge!" Many people followed him onto the bridge. The prelude to a magnificent anti-American patriotic struggle was thus opened.

	The panicked military leaders in Washington, upon hearing the news, hurriedly ordered the "Enterprise," which was heading to Sasebo, to slow down and delay its arrival by one day, entering the port on January 19.

	Later, the U.S. government, in order to cover up its panic, lied that "due to the storm in the Sulphur Island area, the arrival of the 'Enterprise' in Sasebo was delayed." However, the weather report from the Japanese Meteorological Agency said, "There was no storm in the Pacific." Obviously, the American nuclear aircraft carrier was not afraid of the storm at sea but of the anti-American patriotic storm of the Japanese people.

	On the morning of January 19, as soon as the "Enterprise" entered Sasebo Bay, the American officers and sailors on board, seeing Japanese reporters who came to interview them, asked nervously, "Can you guarantee our safety if we go ashore in Sasebo?"

	In fact, what awaited them was an angry Sasebo, a fighting Sasebo. For several days, Japanese patriotic people, despite the suppression of reactionary police, insisted on holding protest rallies and demonstrations. American sailors were intercepted by the angry crowd. The base authorities were so frightened that they had to order the American sailors on the "Enterprise" not to go out.

	In the afternoon of January 21, during the height of the struggle, more than 80 brave patriotic students crossed the Sasebo River, climbed over the walls of the U.S. military base, and planted a red flag in the base. When the Japanese police and U.S. military police inside the base discovered it, the red flag had been flying for more than ten minutes.

	The people cheered enthusiastically, and the U.S.-Japan reactionaries were in a panic. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Tokyo Shimbun" commented on the incident, saying: "In post-war Japan, it is not uncommon to launch a struggle against U.S. military bases, but breaking through the tight police cordon and entering the base is a rare occurrence. The Japanese police authorities admitted that this was a big blow to them." A reactionary police chief in charge of guarding Sasebo during the docking of the "Enterprise" was in a state of panic and begged the U.S. military authorities, saying: "Due to the students' use of 'guerrilla tactics,' they entered the base. We express our deep regret for this."

	The anti-American patriotic united front continues to expand

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In recent years, the anti-imperialist, anti-oppression, and anti-control patriotic united front of the Japanese people of all classes has been continuously expanding. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle."

	In the struggle against the docking of the "Enterprise," the strength of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic united front, with the revolutionary left as its core, was demonstrated.

	Apart from directly participating in the large-scale struggle in Sasebo, the genuine Marxist-Leninists and the broad revolutionary masses in Japan also held protest actions in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Yamaguchi, and other places.

	In addition to patriotic students from various places, more than 20,000 workers from Nagasaki and Fukuoka in western Japan also participated in the Sasebo struggle. Members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) in Fukuoka Prefecture went to Sasebo twice on January 18 and 21 to participate in the local struggle.

	In the afternoon of January 18, when a group of patriotic students were fighting against the reactionary police guarding the U.S. military base at the Sasebo Bridgehead, a large number of armed police surrounded the patriotic students from behind. At this time, revolutionary workers and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) from Fukuoka Prefecture rushed to the back of the patriotic students' ranks, holding high the red flags of struggle, blocking the attacking police, and tying up the enemy. Although there were many women and elderly people in this group, they were fearless. Their actions deeply moved the patriotic students and were praised by the citizens of Sasebo.

	More and more citizens of Sasebo took to the streets to support the struggles of patriotic workers and students from various places. On January 21, more than 20,000 citizens came to the scene of the struggle. Among them, some people threw stones at the police and shouted, "Reactionary police, go back!" Citizens from Tokyo, Fukuoka, and other places also raised funds for the patriotic fighters who were injured and arrested in the struggle.

	In stark contrast to these anti-American patriotic actions of the broad revolutionary people of Japan was the treacherous behavior of a small group of Miyamoto revisionist group members in this struggle. Whether they are truly anti-American or not is an important point of distinction between the revolutionaries and these traitors.

	The members of the Miyamoto group shouted "anti-American" verbally, but after arriving in Sasebo, they sneaked away during the large-scale struggles on January 18 and 21. These traitors also called brave patriotic students "troublemakers" and "instigators" and colluded with reactionary police to suppress them. On January 21, the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party incited a group of thugs to arm themselves with sticks and helmets at the scene of the struggle, attempting to attack patriotic students. However, the citizens of Sasebo, seeing this treacherous behavior, angrily protested and seized the sticks from their hands.

	A shopkeeper in Sasebo said, "The actions of the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party in Sasebo show that they are not opposed to the American nuclear aircraft carrier or American imperialism, but to patriotic students and revolutionary people."

	A worker from Yawata Steel Works said, "The revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party are traitors to the Japanese revolution. To carry out the struggle against American imperialism to the end, we must overthrow them."

	The struggle of the Japanese people this time against the docking of American nuclear ships has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of Japan and has greatly dampened the arrogance of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group. It heralds that the anti-American patriotic struggle, with the Japanese revolutionary left as its core, will develop further. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." "The Japanese people will definitely be able to drive the American imperialists out of their own country, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will definitely be realized."

    反美怒潮逐浪高
    ——记日本人民反对美国核舰只停泊的斗争
    在最近十天内，以佐世保为中心，日本全国各地人民开展了激烈的反美爱国斗争，反对美国“企业号”核航空母舰等核舰只到佐世保停泊。这场斗争取得了辉煌的胜利，表明以日本革命左派为核心的日本人民的反美爱国斗争，正在沿着胜利的道路前进。
      美日反动派都是纸老虎
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”
    反动卖国的日本佐藤政府，一面出卖日本民族利益，把美国核舰只引进佐世保港；一面又非常害怕日本人民反对“企业号”停泊的斗争。它在“企业号”开进佐世保港之前，就从全国二十七个都、道、府、县增调五千八百名武装警察、两千多名便衣特务、二百八十多辆喷水车、装甲车和各种警车，到人口仅有二十五万的佐世保驻扎。同时，它公然使用类似以前的日本军国主义者在战时使用过的法西斯法律，在全国各地疯狂进行所谓“事前搜捕”。据日本警察当局自己宣布，从一月十日到二十一日，就在全国逮捕了近五百名爱国学生和工人。
    佐藤政府特别害怕佐世保人民和全国各地人民联合起来，特别害怕东京、大阪、京都等地爱国学生到佐世保去参加斗争。
    十五日，佐藤政府派出大批武装警察，在东京无理地逮捕了一百三十一名准备前往佐世保的爱国学生。
    在福冈，反动警察在宫本修正主义集团的配合下，竭力阻止来自东京、大阪、京都的学生在九州大学留宿，并且连日封锁车站，阻拦学生乘车去佐世保。
    佐世保车站上更是武装警察密布，便衣特务成群。每当列车到站，这些反动警察特务便慌作一团，睁大贼眼，企图从旅客中认出前来参加斗争的爱国学生。
    但是，反美爱国的怒潮决不是这些反动警察特务所能挡住的。十七日清晨，东京、京都、大阪的青年学生一千多人，长途跋涉、冲破敌人一次又一次的野蛮镇压，冲破一道又一道的封锁线，终于来到了佐世保的斗争前线。
    他们躲开了警察密布的车站出口，沿着美军专用火车线，愤怒地高呼反美口号，向着美军基地进军。在基地附近的平濑桥头，他们受到人数比他们多一倍的武装警察的镇压。但是，勇敢的青年学生迎着喷水车喷出的水柱和催泪瓦斯前进，坚持向反动警察斗争。突然，有一位青年打开了一面越南南方民族解放阵线的英雄的旗帜，高喊一声：“冲啊！”许多人跟在后面冲上桥面。一场轰轰烈烈的反美爱国斗争的序幕就这样揭开了。
    胆战心惊的华盛顿军事头目听到消息，急忙命令正在开往佐世保的“企业号”放慢速度，比原订计划推迟一天，在十九日进港。
    事后，美国政府为了掩盖它的慌张情绪，撒谎说什么“由于硫磺岛海域的暴风雨，推迟了‘企业号’到达佐世保的时间”。但是日本气象台的气象报告，却说“太平洋并没有暴风雨”。很显然，美国核航空母舰害怕的不是海上的暴风雨，而是日本人民的反美爱国的风暴。
    十九日上午，“企业号”刚进入佐世保湾，舰上的美国军官和水兵见到前往采访的日本记者，就神色不安地问：“在佐世保上岸能保证我们的安全吗？”
    事实上，等待着他们的是一个愤怒的佐世保，一个战斗的佐世保。一连几天，日本爱国人民不怕反动警察的镇压，坚持举行抗议集会示威。美国水兵受到愤怒的群众的拦截。美军基地当局吓得不得不下令禁止“企业号”美国水兵外出。
    在二十一日下午斗争的高潮中，八十多名英勇的爱国学生渡过佐世保河，越过美军基地的围墙，把红旗插进了基地。当基地内的日本警察和美军宪兵发现时，这面红旗已经飘扬了十多分钟。
    人民群众热烈拍手叫好，美日反动派慌成一片。日本资产阶级报纸《东京新闻》评论这件事说：“在日本战后，开展反对美军基地斗争并不稀奇，但是冲破警察的密密层层的警备闯入基地，却是极少的事例。日本警察当局承认这是对他们的一个很大的打击。”在“企业号”停泊期间担任佐世保警卫的一名反动警察头目恐慌万状地向美军当局求饶说：“由于学生采取了‘游击战术’，他们进入了基地。我们对此表示非常遗憾。”
    反美爱国统一战线不断扩大
    毛主席教导我们说：“这些年来，日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线不断地扩大。这是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”
    在反对“企业号”停泊的斗争中，显示了以革命左派为核心的日本人民反美爱国统一战线的强大力量。
    日本全国真正的马克思列宁主义者和广大革命群众，除了直接投入在佐世保进行的声势浩大的斗争之外，还在东京、大阪、京都、神户、山口等地开展抗议行动。
    参加佐世保斗争的除了各地的爱国学生以外，还有日本西部长崎、福冈等地的两万多名工人。福冈县的日中友好协会（正统）会员，十八日和二十一日两次前往佐世保，参加了当地的斗争。
    十八日下午，当一批爱国学生在佐世保桥头同守卫美军基地的日本反动警察进行针锋相对的斗争时，一大批武装警察绕路从后面包围爱国学生。这时，福冈县的革命工人和日中友协（正统）会员，高举着战斗的红旗，赶到爱国学生的队伍后面，挡住了偷袭的警察，牵制了敌人。尽管这支队伍里有不少的妇女和老人，但是他们面无惧色。他们的行动使爱国学生极为感动，并且受到佐世保市民的赞扬。
    佐世保的市民越来越多地走上街头，支援各地爱国工人和学生的斗争。二十一日有两万多市民来到了斗争的现场。他们当中有些人用石头打警察，高呼“反动警察滚回去”的口号。东京、福冈等地的市民还为在斗争中负伤和被捕的爱国者募捐。
    同日本广大革命人民的这些反美爱国行动形成鲜明对比的，是一小撮宫本修正主义集团分子在这场斗争中的叛卖行为。真反美还是假反美，这是革命派同这些叛徒之间重要的区别之点。
    宫本集团分子在口头上叫嚷“反美”，但是，他们来到佐世保后，在十八日和二十一日的大规模的斗争中，偷偷地溜掉了。这些叛徒还把勇敢的爱国学生叫做“破坏分子”和“挑拨者”，并且伙同反动警察去镇压他们。二十一日，日共修正主义分子指使一批暴徒，在斗争现场用棍棒和安全帽把自己武装起来，企图袭击爱国学生，但是看到这种叛徒行为的佐世保市民，向他们愤怒地提出了抗议，并且从他们的手中夺下了棍棒。
    佐世保一位店员说：“日共修正主义分子在佐世保的行动，说明他们反对的不是美国核航空母舰，不是美帝国主义，而是爱国学生和革命人民。”
    来自八幡制铁所的一名工人说，“日共修正主义分子是日本革命的叛徒，要把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，必须打倒他们。”
    日本人民这次反对美国核舰只停泊的斗争，大长了日本革命人民的志气，大灭了美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团的威风。它预示着以日本革命左派为核心的反美爱国斗争，将会有更大的发展。正象伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：‘日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”
