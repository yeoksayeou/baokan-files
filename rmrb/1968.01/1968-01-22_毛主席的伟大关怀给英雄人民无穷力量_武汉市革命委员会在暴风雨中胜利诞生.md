The great concern of Chairman Mao gives the heroic people endless strength. The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee is born in the storm.

More than 500,000 military and civilian personnel joyfully held a celebration rally, determined to defend the proletarian revolutionary government, help it improve and develop, and lead the broad revolutionary masses to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the new year, seizing complete victory in the Cultural Revolution!

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 21st: Amid the clarion call of the entire nation's military and civilian personnel to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a heartening piece of news came from the banks of the ten-thousand-mile-long Yangtze River: The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee was born in the storm of class struggle! This is another victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Wuhan is a heroic city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. In the great course of the Chinese revolution, our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, has come to Wuhan many times, guiding the revolutionary ship to victory. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has always been very concerned about the Cultural Revolution movement in the Wuhan area and has personally inspected Wuhan. Chairman Mao's great concern has given the heroic people of Wuhan boundless inspiration and endless strength. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely, overcome countless difficulties, and won decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the 20th, Wuhan's three towns were red with flags and filled with victory songs. More than 500,000 revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, with deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards our great leader Chairman Mao, gathered around the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beating drums and gongs, joyfully surging from all directions to the central venue in Hankou and the venues in Wuchang, Hankou, Hanyang, and Qingshan, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration rally began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." When the rally announced the birth of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the venue erupted in cheers, and drums echoed through the sky. People shouted over and over again: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The glorious birth of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee declared the complete failure of the plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to restore capitalism in the Wuhan area. The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Wuhan, with a rich revolutionary tradition, are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. They have armed themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, smashed the frenzied counterattacks of the class enemies, exposed the anti-revolutionary revisionist element Wang Renshu and his clique of capitalist roaders within the Party in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, and seized back the power they had usurped into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

"Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." At this critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the great People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao that "the People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses," stood up, closely united with the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan, fought together, and won together, and achieved great merits in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

"Windmills move, turtles and snakes are still, great plans arise." The people of Wuhan, who have won decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and are further fully implementing, item by item, Chairman Mao's latest instructions to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary situation in Wuhan is better than ever, and it is getting better and better.

At the celebration rally, Fang Ming, the chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, spoke. He said: In sailing the vast ocean, we rely on the helmsman; in making revolution, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory we have achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year is a victory of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts. We solemnly pledge to the great leader Chairman Mao: We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Fang Ming emphasized that the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are powerful ideological weapons for us to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every proletarian revolutionary warrior should become a model in learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In the brilliant year of 1968, we will take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, earnestly run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously promote the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, work hard on the words, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thoroughly transform our worldview, carry out ideological revolutionization, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our own units, further carry out the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement, strengthen military-civilian unity, concentrate on revolution, and vigorously promote production, and strive forward to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region, Zhang Zhaojian, Yang Chunting, and Li Changgen, as well as representatives from the Wuhan Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress and the Wuhan Region Red Guards' Great Middle School Representatives' Congress, attended the rally.

The commander of the Wuhan Military Region, General Zhang Siyu, spoke at the rally, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee. He said that the establishment of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a new starting point for the struggle. He hoped that the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee would lead the revolutionary people of Wuhan to further extensively and deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, always place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, transform everything, and promote everything, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and turn Wuhan into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. He said that the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a proletarian revolutionary government, and we must maintain its revolutionary authority, help it improve and develop, and lead the broad revolutionary masses to, in the new year, even higher raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
