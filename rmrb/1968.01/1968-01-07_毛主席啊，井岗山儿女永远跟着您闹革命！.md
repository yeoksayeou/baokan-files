Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan will forever follow you in revolution!

The vast pine forests of Jinggangshan sing loudly, and the thousand-mile blue waves of the Gan River cheer exuberantly: Under the loving care of the great leader Chairman Mao, and in the call to arms for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been established!

Millions of children of Jinggangshan sincerely wish: "Chairman Mao, we wish you eternal life! Eternal life!"

Millions of children of Jinggangshan solemnly vow: "Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you in revolution!"

The past year was a year filled with stormy waves. In this year, the heroic children of Jinggangshan waged a heroic and extraordinary struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi.

Whether it was during the days of white terror under the bourgeois reactionary line or in the moments of victory for the revolutionary masses, the children of Jinggangshan, with their hearts of red loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, most resolutely and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the guidance of the series of brilliant directives from the great leader Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province has achieved decisive victories.

The children of Jinggangshan, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, closely follow the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao, and with their revolutionary practices, have composed another moving song of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao!

"Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan are most loyal to you!"

From the majestic slopes of Jinggangshan to the banks of the vast Poyang Lake, everywhere you can hear the children of Jiangxi's proletarian revolutionaries deeply and emotionally say: "Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan are most loyal to you!" This is the most precious family heirloom of the revolutionary forebears of the Jiangxi revolutionary base area, and it is the most resolute vow of the children of Jinggangshan. The great thought of Mao Zedong is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province.

In the city of Jian, under Jinggangshan, several retired old Red Army soldiers, led by Comrade Peng Renshan, formed a "Red Army Propaganda Team" to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During the days of white terror under the bourgeois reactionary line, they stood together with the young revolutionaries. During the day, they wrote big-character posters with the young revolutionaries; at night, they stood guard with the young revolutionaries. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party regarded them as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones, cursing them: "You are old and useless, don't cause trouble anymore." Comrade Peng Renshan, with a stern look, resolutely replied: "We may be old, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never grow old!"

Like the old Red Army soldiers in Jian, the old Red Guards who followed Chairman Mao in revolution, the insurgent soldiers who guarded the outposts on Jinggangshan, the Long March veterans who crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and the old revolutionaries of Jinggangshan who fought in countless battles, today, their hearts loyal to Chairman Mao are even redder. At the most critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, without a moment's hesitation or a moment's wavering!

The old generation of Jinggangshan set a shining example of loyalty to Chairman Mao for the young revolutionary successors. The young generation inherited the glorious tradition of loyalty to Chairman Mao from the revolutionary forebears and sang the battle song of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and defending Chairman Mao to the death: "Cut off my head, it's nothing; as long as the cause is true; defend Chairman Mao, and I will die contentedly!" They sang this heroic battle song and waged a heroic struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi.

The Red Guards of Nanchang No. 5 Middle School are truly the successors of the children of Jinggangshan. Since June 1966, they, together with the revolutionary rebels of Nanchang, have raised the revolutionary banner high, broken through countless difficulties and obstacles, and fought their way out from under the heavy oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party hated them so much that they wielded the big stick of the reactionary line, cursing them as "a handful of monsters and demons causing trouble." The revolutionary young people of No. 5 Middle School were thus labeled as "a handful."

"This army has an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight." The heroic young revolutionaries of No. 5 Middle School, remembering the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly declared: "We are the descendants of the people of Jinggangshan. With Chairman Mao backing us, we fear neither heaven nor earth. For the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we are willing to be the revolutionary 'handful'." Amidst the curses, the "handful" combat team of No. 5 Middle School was established!

The young people of No. 5 Middle School fearlessly rushed to the front lines of the struggle. The revolutionary young people of Nanchang all rushed forward, and the heroic children of Jinggangshan all rushed forward. "A handful" became a large group. In Nanchang, Jian, Fuzhou, Ganzhou, and various places in Jiangxi, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and formed a surging revolutionary army.

"Looking up at the Big Dipper, thinking of Mao Zedong in my heart." Even in those days of white terror, the children of Jinggangshan always thought of their most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, filled with unlimited confidence in victory and boundless strength. A revolutionary fighter in the Hualin Reclamation Farm of Gaoyou County, who stood up to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The capitalist roaders cruelly persecuted him, not allowing him to read newspapers, listen to the radio, or read Chairman Mao's works. But how could the cruel persecution take away the children of Jinggangshan's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao! This revolutionary fighter, with his deep affection for Chairman Mao, wrote ten poems titled "Chairman Mao, I will forever be loyal to you" on his shirt.

	"Great leader Chairman Mao,
	I will forever and ever be loyal to you.
	To defend your revolutionary line,
	I am willing to dye the flag red with my green blood!"

This is one of the poems. It tells people: No matter what dark clouds appear in the sky, no matter what evil winds blow on the earth, the heroic children of Jinggangshan will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!

Most loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, this is the highest awakening, the purest quality of the children of Jinggangshan, this is the soul of the revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan!

"Chairman Mao, whatever you say, the children of Jinggangshan will do!"

The rivers roar, the people laugh, and the mountains nod. Our great leader Chairman Mao, during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China last year, personally came to Jiangxi, guiding the children of Jinggangshan to achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This is the most unforgettable and happiest day for the children of Jinggangshan!

Comrade Chen Changfu, an old Red Army soldier who followed Chairman Mao on the Long March and a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, saw Chairman Mao again and heard Chairman Mao's great and brilliant instructions on the Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi. From Jinggangshan to Yan'an, from Yan'an to Beijing, in that long journey filled with stormy waves, the Chinese revolution, under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, has sailed past countless reefs and shoals, from one victory to another.

Several decades of revolutionary practice have made Comrade Chen Changfu and the children of Jinggangshan deeply realize this great truth: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Following Chairman Mao's words, the revolution develops and wins; going against Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolution retreats and fails!

"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do!" This is the greatest wisdom, the greatest talent, and the greatest skill of the children of Jinggangshan.

In Xingguo County, which Chairman Mao once praised as a model revolutionary base area, the revolutionary masses most resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, without the slightest hesitation or deviation.

This county had two leading cadres who had carried out the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Later, the leadership wanted to send these two cadres to Beijing for study. Should they be allowed to go? Some comrades said: "They made mistakes in direction and line, can we still let them go to Beijing for study? No!" Comrade Xu Guiying, a female telephone operator from the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, who was once labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by these two cadres, said at this time: "Holding cadre study classes is an instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao, we will definitely carry it out! I believe that by Chairman Mao's side, they will definitely learn more Mao Zedong Thought." Comrade Xu Guiying actively went to talk to these two leading cadres and personally sent them to the train to Beijing.

Millions of children of Jinggangshan are like the revolutionary masses of Xingguo, firmly believing in and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the heroic city of Nanchang, it was Chairman Mao's latest instructions that guided the revolutionary young people to achieve revolutionary unity. The three revolutionary Red Guard organizations of Nanchang No. 2 Middle School were studying how to achieve revolutionary unity when Chairman Mao's latest instructions came: "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary unity on the basis of revolutionary principles."

The revolutionary young people said: "We will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions!" Immediately, they organized the masses to study and discuss. They overthrew bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and, with the spirit of "seizing the day," achieved revolutionary unity overnight.

In August of last year, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Fuzhou region took power. An urgent problem faced them: how to deal with the deceived masses? The revolutionary comrades studied Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly treating the deceived masses and actively sought out the deceived masses to talk to them, educating and helping them, kindly telling them: "Welcome back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and join us in seizing the revolution and promoting production, directing the spearhead of the struggle at the biggest capitalist roader within the party and his agents in Jiangxi!" The deceived masses were moved to tears, saying: "The revolutionary masses are the ones who listen to Chairman Mao the most!"

The children of Jinggangshan, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, seriously study and resolutely carry out each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, welcoming one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi:

Chairman Mao called for: "Criticize and repudiate revisionism and struggle against selfishness." The children of Jinggangshan set up battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and struggling against selfishness in factories, fields, classrooms, and barracks. In a short time, tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up throughout the province, with tens of thousands of people participating in the study;

Chairman Mao called for: "Achieve revolutionary unity on the basis of revolutionary principles." Within a month, revolutionary unity was achieved on all fronts in the heroic city of Nanchang, and revolutionary unity was also achieved in six prefectures and more than 90% of the counties (cities) in the province;

Chairman Mao called for: "Believe in and rely on the majority of cadres," and "implement the three-in-one combination." The children of Jinggangshan, with the spirit of "seizing the day," liberated a large number of revolutionary cadres, and the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born in victory, and more than 80% of the counties in the province also established temporary leading bodies;

Chairman Mao called for: "Support the army and love the people." The People's Liberation Army stationed in Jiangxi firmly supported the broad revolutionary masses on the left, and "model soldiers" like Li Wentong and the heroic Fourth Platoon appeared. The children of Jinggangshan called the People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao their "closest relatives," and the military and civilian unity was deeper than ever;

Chairman Mao called for: "Seize the revolution and promote production." This year, Jiangxi's agriculture is bountiful in all aspects, and industry is booming!

"Below the mountain, below the mountain, the red flag waves like a painting." The children of Jinggangshan resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, never relaxing, not deviating by a single step, and winning decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Chairman Mao, the children of Jinggangshan will forever advance to victory along the course you have indicated!"

On the eve of the brilliant 1968, a piece of great news was announced:

The most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health, full of vigor, and together with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, received more than 20,000 revolutionary fighters from all over the country. The representatives of the heroic children of Jinggangshan happily saw the great leader Chairman Mao.

Comrade Cheng Shiqing, a responsible person of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, and the responsible person of the revolutionary mass organizations, were extremely excited and overjoyed. After seeing Chairman Mao, they immediately rushed back to Nanchang to report the good news to the people of the province. Comrade Cheng Shiqing excitedly said: "Our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, received us! Chairman Mao warmly shook our hands, and Chairman Mao warmly greeted the people of Jiangxi. This is Chairman Mao shaking hands with 22 million children of Jinggangshan, greeting 22 million children of Jinggangshan. This is the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest care from the great leader Chairman Mao to the people of Jiangxi! We must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow Chairman Mao, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Since its establishment in August last year, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group has always placed the dissemination of Chairman Mao's voice and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. The first meeting they held, the first issue they discussed, and the first task they arranged was how to make Chairman Mao's instructions reach the people of the entire province as quickly, widely, and directly as possible. Wherever there were the most problems and the sharpest contradictions, the leading comrades of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group went there to propagate Chairman Mao's instructions. Every time they went deep into the grassroots, when the masses asked them for instructions, they always said: "We have no instructions, the only instruction is the instruction of the great leader Chairman Mao. Our task is to convey Chairman Mao's instructions word for word and implement them without the slightest deviation!"

The Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group organized a large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, mines, offices, schools, and rural areas to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses. Now, in every corner of Jiangxi, there are classrooms for studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have entered people's hearts and are known to all.

A new year of battle has begun. The New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily has conveyed the latest battle command of the great leader Chairman Mao: With great enthusiasm, strive for the forefront, continue to make efforts, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

"Orders were issued yesterday, ten thousand workers and peasants rushed to Jian." In these days, in the areas under Jinggangshan and along the banks of the Gan River, the leaders of various levels, military units, and revolutionary mass organizations have all gone deep into factories, offices, schools, rural areas, and units, together with the revolutionary masses, studying the New Year's Day editorial and researching measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The responsible person of the temporary leading body of Ganzhou came to the workers in the early morning of New Year's Day to explain the New Year's Day editorial to everyone and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together. The workers happily said: "Revolutionary leading cadres follow Chairman Mao step by step. On the first day of the new year, they brought us Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must strive with great enthusiasm, strive for the forefront, continue to make efforts, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The full implementation of your latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Now, a tide of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is rapidly rising in all parts of Jiangxi Province.

The heroic children of Jinggangshan vow to the great leader Chairman Mao: In the new year of battle, we will definitely, like the heroes of the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wentong, resolve to do: "Chairman Mao loves me, I love; Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao instructs me, I carry out; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The children of Jinggangshan resolve to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, forever and ever follow you! Generation after generation will follow you! Following you, we can reach the moon in the sky; following you, we can catch turtles in the five oceans; following you, we will definitely achieve the complete victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

    毛主席啊，井岗山儿女永远跟着您闹革命！
    井冈山的万顷松涛放声高歌，赣江水的千里碧波纵情欢呼：在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，江西省革命委员会成立了！
    千百万井冈山儿女衷心祝愿：“毛主席啊，我们敬祝您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    千百万井冈山儿女庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，我们永远跟着您闹革命！”
    过去的一年，是充满着惊涛骇浪的一年。在这一年多里，英雄的井冈山儿女向着中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人，展开了一场英勇卓绝的斗争。
    无论是在资产阶级反动路线实行白色恐怖的日子里，还是在无产阶级革命派取得斗争胜利的时刻，井冈山儿女都怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，最坚决、最勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在伟大领袖毛主席一系列光辉指示的指引下，江西省的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    具有光荣革命传统的井冈山儿女，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用自己的革命实践，谱写出了又一曲动人心魄的无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛主席，无限崇拜毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的伟大颂歌！
    “毛主席啊，井冈山儿女最忠于您！”
    从巍巍井冈山麓，到滔滔波阳湖畔，到处可以听到江西省无产阶级革命派无限深情地说：“毛主席啊，井冈山儿女最忠于您！”这是江西革命老根据地革命前辈们最珍贵的传家宝，是井冈山儿女最坚决的誓言。伟大的毛泽东思想，是江西省无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的最根本保证。
    在井冈山下的吉安市，几十名退休的老红军战士为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以彭仁山同志为首，组成了“红军宣传队”。在资产阶级反动路线实行白色恐怖的日子里，他们和小将们风雨同舟。白天，和小将们一块写大字报；晚上，和小将们一块站岗放哨。党内一小撮走资派把他们视作眼中钉、肉中刺，骂他们：“你们年老了，不中用了，别出来闹事了。”彭仁山同志横眉冷对那些坏家伙，斩钉截铁地回答：“我们人老了，忠于毛主席的红心没有老，永远不会老！”
    象吉安市的老红军这样，那些当年跟着毛主席闹革命的老赤卫队员，井冈山上坚守哨卡的暴动队战士，爬雪山过草地的长征老红军，南征北战出生入死的井冈山老一代，今天，他们无限忠于毛主席的心更红了。在无产阶级文化大革命最关键的时刻，他们坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，一分一秒不犹豫，一丝一毫不动摇！
    井冈山的老一代，给年青的革命小将树立了最忠于毛主席的光辉榜样。年青一代继承革命前辈最忠于毛主席的光荣传统，唱起了永远忠于毛主席、誓死保卫毛主席的战歌：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真；保卫毛主席，死了也甘心！”他们高唱着这豪迈的战歌，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人展开了英勇的斗争。
    南昌五中的红卫兵小将，不愧为年青一代的井冈山儿女。从一九六六年六月，他们和南昌的革命造反派一道，高举革命大旗，冲破千难万阻，从资产阶级反动路线的重重压制下冲杀了出来。党内一小撮走资派对他们恨得咬牙切齿，挥舞起反动路线的大棒，咒骂他们是“一小撮牛鬼蛇神翻天”。五中的革命小将，就这样被打成了“一小撮”。
    “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”英雄的五中的革命小将，铭记着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，庄严宣告：“我们是井冈山人的后代，有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们天不怕，地不怕。为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们甘当革命的‘一小撮’。”就在一片谩骂声中，五中“一小撮”战斗团成立了！
    五中的小将们无所畏惧，勇敢地冲上了斗争第一线。南昌的革命小将都冲上去了，井冈山的英雄儿女统统冲上去了。“一小撮”成了一大群。在南昌，在吉安，在抚州，在赣州，在江西各地，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，结成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    “抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”。就是在那白色恐怖的日子里，井冈山儿女时刻想念着最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，心中充满了无限的胜利信心，身上充满了无穷的力量。高安县华林垦殖场一位奋起保卫毛主席革命路线的革命战士，被党内一小撮走资派打成了“反革命”。走资派残酷地迫害他，报纸不许看，广播不许听，毛主席著作不许读。但是，残酷的迫害怎么能夺走井冈山儿女无限忠于毛主席的红心！这位革命战士怀着忠于毛主席的无限深情，在自己的衬衣上写下了十首《毛主席，我永远忠于您》的诗篇。
      “伟大统帅毛主席，
    我永远永远忠于您。
    为了捍卫您的革命路线，
    愿将碧血染红旗！”
    这是其中的一首。它告诉人们：不管天空出现什么乌云，不管大地上刮起什么妖风，英雄的井冈山儿女永远忠于毛主席！
    最最忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，这正是井冈山儿女最高最高的觉悟，最纯最纯的品质，这正是井冈山革命精神的灵魂！
    “毛主席啊，您老人家怎么说，井冈山儿女就怎么做！”
    河欢人笑山点头。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在去年视察华北、中南和华东地区的时候，亲临江西，指引井冈山儿女去夺取无产阶级文化大革命新的更伟大的胜利！
    这是井冈山儿女最难忘、最幸福的日子！
    曾经跟随毛主席长征的老红军、省革命委员会筹备小组成员陈昌奉同志，这次又见到了毛主席，听到了毛主席对江西文化大革命的伟大英明指示。从井冈山到延安，从延安到北京，在那充满惊涛骇浪的漫长航程中，中国革命沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向前进，绕过无数险滩暗礁，从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。
    几十年的革命实践，陈昌奉同志，井冈山儿女，都深刻地认识到这一伟大的真理：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。听毛主席的话，革命就发展，就胜利；违背毛主席的教导，革命就倒退，就失败！
    “毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做！”这是井冈山儿女最大的聪明，最大的才能，最大的本领。
    在兴国——当年毛主席表扬过的红色根据地模范县，革命派最坚决地执行毛主席的最新指示，半点不犹豫，分毫不走样。
    这个县有两个领导干部，他们在文化大革命初期，执行过资产阶级反动路线。后来，领导上要调这两个干部去北京学习。让不让他们去？一部分同志说：“他们犯了方向路线的错误，还能让他们去北京学习？不能！”现在担任县“大联筹”负责人的邮电局女话务员徐桂英同志，过去曾经被这两个干部打成“反革命”，这时候她说：“举办干部学习班，是伟大领袖毛主席的指示，我们坚决照办！我相信，在毛主席身边，他们一定会学到更多的毛泽东思想。”徐桂英同志主动去找这两个领导干部谈心，并且亲自送他们上车去北京。
    千千万万个井冈山儿女，就是象兴国的革命派这样，对毛主席的指示坚信不疑，坚决执行。
    在英雄的南昌城，正是毛主席的最新指示，指导着革命小将实现了革命的大联合。南昌二中原来的三个革命的红卫兵组织，正在研究怎样实现革命大联合的时候，传来了毛主席的最新指示：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”
    革命小将们说：“毛主席的最新指示，我们坚决照办！”于是，头头们忘了吃饭，忘了睡觉，立即组织群众学习、讨论。他们打倒了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，一夜之间就实现了革命的大联合。
    去年八月，抚州地区的无产阶级革命派掌权了。一个迫切的问题摆在他们面前：如何对待受蒙蔽的群众？革命派同志们学习了毛主席的要正确对待受蒙蔽群众的指示，纷纷主动找受蒙蔽群众谈心，教育和帮助他们，亲切地对他们说：“欢迎你们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和我们一块抓革命，促生产，把斗争矛头对准党内最大的走资派和他在江西的代理人！”受蒙蔽群众感动得流着热泪说：“革命派就是最听毛主席的话！”
    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的井冈山儿女，对毛主席的每一个最新指示认真学习，坚决贯彻，迎来了江西省无产阶级文化大革命一个又一个的胜利：
    毛主席号召：“要斗私，批修”。井冈山儿女就在车间，在田头，在课堂，在营房，摆开了斗私批修的战场。短短的时间内，全省城乡办起了上万个毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的有几十万人；
    毛主席号召：“要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”在一个月内，英雄城南昌各条战线革命的大联合实现了，全省六个专区和百分之九十以上的县（市）革命的大联合也实现了；
    毛主席号召：“相信和依靠干部的大多数”，“实行革命三结合”。井冈山儿女以“只争朝夕”的精神，解放了一大批革命干部，江西省革命委员会胜利地诞生了，全省六个专区、一个市和百分之八十以上的县也建立了临时领导机构；
    毛主席号召：要“拥军爱民”。驻江西的人民解放军，坚决支持左派广大革命群众，出现了象李文忠和英雄四排这样的“爱民模范”。井冈山儿女把毛主席派来的解放军称作是自己“最亲最亲的亲人”，军民团结鱼水情，从来没有今天这样深；
    毛主席号召：“抓革命，促生产”。今年江西的农业样样丰收，工业蒸蒸日上！
    “山下山下，风展红旗如画。”井冈山儿女坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，时时刻刻不放松，一丝一毫不走样，赢得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    “毛主席啊，井冈山儿女永远沿着您指引的航向胜利前进！”
    光辉灿烂的一九六八年前夕，传来了特大的喜讯：
    最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身体非常健康，神采奕奕，和他的亲密战友林副主席一起，接见了全国各地的两万多名革命战士。英雄的井冈山儿女的代表，幸福地见到了伟大领袖毛主席。
    省革命委员会筹备小组的负责人程世清同志和革命群众组织的负责人，无比兴奋，万分喜悦，见到毛主席以后立即赶回南昌，向全省人民报喜。程世清同志激动地说：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席接见了我们！毛主席亲切地握了我们的手，毛主席亲切地问候江西人民。这是伟大领袖毛主席跟两千二百万井冈山儿女握手，向两千二百万井冈山儿女问候。这是伟大领袖毛主席对江西人民的最大鼓舞、最大教育、最大鞭策、最大爱护！我们一定要把毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，紧跟毛主席，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！”
    江西省革命委员会筹备小组从去年八月成立以来，一直把传播毛主席的声音，落实毛主席的最新指示，放在一切工作的首位。他们召开的第一次会议，讨论的第一个问题，安排的第一项工作，就是怎样让毛主席的指示最迅速、最广泛、最直接地和全省广大人民见面。那里问题最多，矛盾最尖锐，省革筹小组的领导同志就到那里去宣传毛主席的指示。每次深入基层，群众要求他们作指示，他们总是说：“我们没有什么指示，指示只有一个，这就是伟大领袖毛主席的指示。我们的任务就是把毛主席的指示原原本本地传达下来，不折不扣地贯彻下去！”
    省革筹小组组织了大批的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、矿山、机关、学校、农村，向广大革命群众宣传毛主席的最新指示。现在，江西各地处处是学习毛主席最新指示的课堂。毛主席的最新指示深入人心，家喻户晓。
    新的战斗的一年开始了，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，传来了伟大统帅毛主席的最新战斗号令：鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    “命令昨颁，十万工农下吉安。”这几天，在井冈山下，在赣江两岸，各级领导机构、驻军部队和革命群众组织的负责人，纷纷深入工厂、机关、学校、农村、连队，同革命群众一道，学习元旦社论，研究落实毛主席最新指示的措施。赣州临时领导机构的负责人，元旦清晨就来到工人群众当中，向大家宣讲元旦社论，同大家一道学习毛主席的最新指示。工人群众高兴地说：“革命的领导干部紧跟毛主席寸步不离，新年头一天就给我们送来了毛主席的最新指示。我们一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！现在，一个条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示的热潮，已经在江西全省各地迅速兴起。
    英雄的井冈山儿女向伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：在新的战斗的一年中，我们一定要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，决心做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！井冈山儿女决心继承和发扬光大井冈山革命传统，永远永远紧跟您！世世代代紧跟您！跟着您，可上九天揽月；跟着您，可下五洋捉鳖；跟着您，我们就一定能夺取中国革命和世界革命的彻底胜利！
