The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhouxin Commune in Qingyuan County, Guangdong, deeply criticize the crimes of China's Khrushchev and Tao Zhu in attempting to restore capitalism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 10th: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Zhouxin Commune, Qingyuan County, Guangdong, one of the earliest areas in the Central South region to be poisoned by the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System," are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought to angrily expose and criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader in the Central South region, Tao Zhu, in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. They are thoroughly eliminating the poisonous influence of the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhouxin Commune unanimously pointed out that the masterminds behind the creation and promotion of the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" are China's Khrushchev and Tao Zhu.

In 1960, a scoundrel who had been a landlord's steward and had infiltrated the cadre ranks in the Fenghuang Brigade of Zhouxin Commune, together with the brigade leader of Fenghuang Production Team, based on the opinions of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalist-spirited well-off peasants, divided the low-yield fields into plots, assigned production quotas to each household, and distributed them as rations, euphemistically calling it "on-the-spot grain distribution." A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the county and commune committees admired this practice but felt that dividing land to households was too blatant. They then "summarized and elevated" it, coming up with the so-called "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System," which was forcibly promoted throughout the county starting in the second half of 1961. This "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" involved setting work quotas, production quotas, and cost quotas, managing them by household, rewarding overproduction, and penalizing underproduction. This was a variant of China's Khrushchev's "Three Freedoms and One Contract." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu was overjoyed, personally going to Zhouxin Commune to summarize the experience, falsely claiming that this method "can guide the individual enthusiasm of the commune members to collective production, with many advantages." Tao Zhu then vigorously promoted the "Zhouxin experience" at various meetings and occasions.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Revisionists blur the distinction between socialism and capitalism, and between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. What they advocate is not the socialist line but the capitalist line." At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao made a great directive, issuing the great call to "never forget class struggle," and severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "Three Freedoms and One Contract." After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu still stubbornly adhered to the revisionist line, conspiring to restore capitalism in the countryside. He again went to Zhouxin Commune for "point work," disguising and intensifying the promotion of the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System." He even dared to steal the name of the Central Committee to deceive the masses.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhouxin Commune collected evidence of the serious harm caused by the implementation of the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System," held an exhibition, and toured it through various brigades in the commune, powerfully exposing and criticizing the crimes of China's Khrushchev and Tao Zhu in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants sharply pointed out that the biggest conspiracy behind the promotion of the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" was to oppose leading with Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose highlighting proletarian politics, and to oppose farming for revolution. Chairman Mao taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu promoted the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System," using bonuses as the lead, using bourgeois individualism to lure commune members to farm for rewards, for money, for personal enrichment, attempting to undermine the socialist stronghold in the countryside politically and ideologically.

After the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" was implemented in some places, it seriously damaged the socialist distribution principles of the people's communes, leading to phenomena of less work for more pay, even no work for pay. In Fenghuang Brigade's Lian Sheng Production Team, there were two households of commune members, both with five people and one labor force. Due to the different natural conditions and production quotas of the "responsibility fields" they received, the amount of overproduction grain rewards differed greatly. In 1962, Huang Guangrong received 79 jin of overproduction grain rewards, while Liang Nian Dai received 497 jin, a difference of more than five times. Some brigades' poor and lower-middle peasants also used shocking facts to explain that implementing the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" benefited landlords, rich peasants, and some well-off upper-middle peasants with good technical skills and strong labor forces the most, while it was very unfavorable to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, especially those with young children, few labor forces, and thin family backgrounds. The counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu had once "worked in the field" in the Baji Brigade's Shanwei Production Team, which had 17 households. In 1962, when the "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" was implemented, the entire team rewarded 6,800 jin of overproduction grain, with five households of landlords and rich peasants receiving 3,500 jin, averaging 700 jin per household; 11 households of poor and lower-middle peasants received 3,300 jin, averaging only 300 jin per household. Landlord Chen Zaolian sold the so-called 1,040 jin of grain and a large batch of sweet potatoes at a high price, making a fortune. Poor peasant Lei Lichan, due to a lack of labor, was unable to overproduce the "responsibility fields" she contracted, and her rations were not enough to eat. She was forced to sell a new house she had obtained during the land reform to the landlord Chen Zaolian. Facing these facts, the poor and lower-middle peasants angrily denounced: The "Overproduction Incentive Responsibility System" made the poor and lower-middle peasants poor and miserable, while landlords, rich peasants, and capitalist-spirited households became rich and happy. Let Tao Zhu's advocated "rich and happy socialism" go to hell!

    彻底肃清“超产奖励责任制”的流毒
    广东清远县洲心公社贫下中农深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸复辟资本主义的罪行
    据新华社广州十日电　中南地区最早受到“超产奖励责任制”毒害的广东清远县洲心公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，愤怒地揭露批判中国赫鲁晓夫和中南地区党内最大的走资派陶铸在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，彻底清除“超产奖励责任制”的流毒。
    洲心公社的贫下中农一致指出，炮制和推行“超产奖励责任制”的罪魁祸首是中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸。
    一九六○年，洲心公社凤凰大队一个当过地主管家混进干部队伍的坏家伙，伙同凤岗生产队的队长，根据地主、富农和资本主义自发倾向严重的富裕农民的意见，把低产田一丘丘定出产量，分给社员一家一户经营，当作口粮分配，美其名为“就地分粮”。县委和公社内的一小撮走资派很欣赏这个做法，但觉得搞分田到户太露骨，于是再“总结、提高”一番，搞出了所谓“超产奖励责任制”的办法，于一九六一年下半年开始，强行向全县推广。这种“超产奖励责任制”就是：定工、定产、定成本，分到户管理，超产奖励，减产处罚。这是中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的变种。反革命修正主义分子陶铸如获至宝，亲自到洲心公社总结，胡说什么这个办法“可以把社员的个体积极性引导到集体生产方面来，优越性很多。”接着，陶铸便在各种会议和各种场合拚命鼓吹要推广洲心的“经验”。
    毛主席教导我们说：“修正主义者抹杀社会主义和资本主义的区别，抹杀无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别。他们所主张的，在实际上并不是社会主义路线，而是资本主义路线。”在党的八届十中全会上，毛主席作了伟大指示，发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，严厉地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”。八届十中全会以后，反革命两面派陶铸，仍然死心塌地地坚持修正主义路线，阴谋在农村复辟资本主义。他又跑到洲心公社“蹲点”，给“超产奖励责任制”乔装打扮，变本加厉地加以推行。他还狗胆包天，盗用中央的名义欺骗群众。
    洲心公社的贫下中农，搜集了实行“超产奖励责任制”所造成的严重危害，举办展览会，在全公社各大队巡回展览，有力地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸之流在农村复辟资本主义的罪行。广大贫下中农尖锐地指出，推行“超产奖励责任制”的最大阴谋，就是反对用毛泽东思想挂帅，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对为革命种田。毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”反革命两面派陶铸推行“超产奖励责任制”，是以奖金挂帅，以资产阶级利己主义引诱社员为奖励、为金钱种田，为个人发财种田，妄图从政治上、思想上瓦解农村社会主义的阵地。
      “超产奖励责任制”在有些地方推行后，严重地破坏了人民公社的社会主义分配原则，出现了少劳多得，甚至不劳而获的怪现象。凤凰大队连水生产队有两户社员，同样是五口人一个劳动力，由于分到的
  “责任田”自然条件和定产不同，得奖的超产谷悬殊。一九六二年，黄光荣收入超产奖励谷七十九斤，梁年带收入超产奖励谷四百九十七斤，相差五倍多。有些大队的贫下中农，还以惊心动魄的事实说明，实行“超产奖励责任制”，受益最大的是地主、富农和一些家底厚、技术好、劳动力强的上中农，而对广大贫下中农，特别是子女年幼、劳动力少、家底薄的贫下中农，就极为不利。反革命两面派陶铸曾经“蹲过点”的百加大队的扇尾生产队，共十七户，一九六二年实行“超产奖励责任制”，全队共奖超产谷六千八百斤，五户地主、富农共得奖三千五百斤，平均每户七百斤；十一户贫下中农得奖三千三百斤，平均每户只有三百斤。地主陈灶莲一家把所谓得奖的一千零四十斤粮食和一大批番薯高价出售，大发横财。贫农雷丽婵由于劳动力缺乏，包的“责任田”没能超产，口粮不够吃，被迫将土地改革时分得的一间新屋卖给了地主陈灶莲。面对这些事实，贫下中农们愤怒地控诉说：“超产奖励责任制”使贫下中农贫困痛苦，使地主、富农和资本主义自发户富裕快乐。让陶铸鼓吹的这种富裕快乐的“社会主义”见鬼去吧！
