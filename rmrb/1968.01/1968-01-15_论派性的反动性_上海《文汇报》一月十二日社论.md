Title: On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism

The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a venomous snake. Once it wraps around you, it is disastrous. Some comrades have already been entangled by this venomous snake and are deeply poisoned. Therefore, we must enumerate the ten major crimes of factionalism to alert all revolutionary comrades.

First, regarding the highest directives and the voice of the proletarian headquarters, instead of implementing them word for word and carrying them out in every detail, they selectively pick and choose, disrupting the overall direction of the struggle and shaking the strategic deployment of Chairman Mao's headquarters.

Second, for the private interests of one faction, the interests of the people, the interests of the Party, the interests of the state, and the overall interests are all thrown aside.

Third, they confuse the enemy and us, shielding class enemies. Those who agree with "my" views, no matter if they are spies or traitors, are all "comrades"; those who disagree with "my" views, even if they are comrades, are all turned into "enemies."

Fourth, during the cleanup of class ranks, they only focus on the opposing organization. Once a few bad elements are exposed from it, they generalize from the particular, rejoice in the misfortune, and seize the opportunity to negate the correct direction of the brother revolutionary organizations. For this, they do not hesitate to engage in armed struggles and wage "internal wars."

Fifth, whenever there is a struggle for "seats" or "core status," factionalism erupts in its most vicious form. "With me as the core" is their wrong slogan. Revolutionary great unity can be discarded, but "seats" must be fought for.

Sixth, the release of cadres is judged solely by whether it is beneficial to "my" faction. Those who follow "me" prosper, those who go against "me" perish. Therefore, they alternately shout loudly for "complete release" and then turn around to announce "all to the side," swinging between "left" and "right," constantly changing.

Seventh, they boast and praise themselves, taking credit for others' achievements.

Eighth, they use factionalism to counter factionalism. Under the pretext of opposing others' factionalism, they actually expand their own. When they shout "down with factionalism," they still carry the factional tail "×× (name of the organization) will surely win!" This is an example.

Ninth, those with severe factionalism are fickle, maneuvering and scheming, saying one thing in front and another behind, shaking hands on stage and kicking under the table, playing the tricks of bourgeois politicians.

Tenth, those with severe factionalism do everything for factionalism, promoting reactionary pragmatism. They even use Chairman Mao's quotations out of context to attack others. Their academic style is so bad that it has reached an intolerable level.

From this, it can be seen that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a very dangerous enemy hidden within our revolutionary ranks. It creates splits, affects unity, saps morale, harms the revolution, disrupts production, shields bad elements, and aids the wicked, doing all sorts of evil. With the enemy at hand, we must overthrow it.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has become an important weapon for the bourgeoisie to frenziedly oppose the proletariat. This is not accidental. Now, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have failed in their attempt to organize revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and their economic attacks using counter-revolutionary economism have long been exposed. Thus, they can only rely on the ghost of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They summon this ghost into our revolutionary ranks. Lenin pointed out: "It is better for the bourgeoisie to be maintained by opportunist elements from within the workers' movement than by the bourgeoisie themselves." Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has played the role of a special action team for a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Some comrades have the "private" character in their minds, responding inside and out, and hitting it off immediately. Once these comrades become captives of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie, they are led by the nose by the class enemy and still think they are "correct in the overall direction"!

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a reactionary nature. Going against the revolutionary tide is called reactionary. The revolutionary torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rolling forward, but the reactionary trend of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism attempts to obstruct the advance of the revolutionary torrent. Isn't this reactionary? "Opportunists who try to stop the tide, though almost everywhere, cannot stop the tide." All reactionary things will be swept away by the revolutionary torrent.

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism can deceive some people at a certain time. All comrades deceived by factionalism should no longer be confused and should quickly wake up, open their eyes, turn against it, and thoroughly expose the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great army of the proletarian cultural revolution has only one faction, which is the proletarian revolutionary faction! Only one nature, which is the proletarian party nature! Only by using the proletarian party nature to guide all our actions can we forever follow Chairman Mao in advancing through storms and waves.

Down with factionalism! Cut off the black hands!

The proletarian revolutionary factions unite!

    论派性的反动性
    上海《文汇报》一月十二日社论
    资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性是一条大毒蛇，被它缠上了身就不得了。有的同志身上已缠上了这条毒蛇，中毒很深。为此，必须历数派性的十大罪状，以引起一切革命同志的警觉。
    对待最高指示，对待无产阶级司令部的声音，不是句句照办，条条落实，而是各取所需，干扰斗争大方向，动摇毛主席司令部的战略部署。这是第一条。
    为了一派的私利，什么人民的利益，什么党的利益，什么国家的利益，什么全局的利益，统统抛在一边。这是第二条。
    混淆敌我界限，包庇阶级敌人。同意“我”的观点，不管是特务、叛徒，都是“同志”；不同意“我”的观点，即使是同志，统统成了“敌人”。这是第三条。
    在清理阶级队伍时，眼睛只盯着对方组织，一旦从中揪出了几个坏人，就以偏概全，幸灾乐祸，乘机否定兄弟革命组织的大方向。为此不惜武斗，大开“内战”。这是第四条。
    凡是争“席位”、争“核心”之日，正是派性恶性发作之时。“以我为核心”，就是他们的错误口号。革命大联合可以不要，但“席位”非争不可。这是第五条。
    解放干部一律以是否利于“我”这一派为标准。顺“我”者昌，逆“我”者亡。因此，忽而大声疾呼“全部解放”，忽而翻脸宣布“一律靠边”，“左”右摇摆，变化无常。这是第六条。
    大吹大擂，自我标榜，贪天之功，占为己有。这是第七条。
    用派性反派性。借反对别人的派性为名，行扩展自己的派性是实。当他们在高呼“打倒派性”的同时，还要带上派性的尾巴“×× （本组织大名）必胜！”即是一例。这是第八条。
    派性严重的人，朝秦暮楚，纵横捭阖，当面一套，背后一套，台上握手，台下踢脚，耍资产阶级政客作风。这是第九条。
    派性严重的人，什么都是为派性服务，推行反动的实用主义。他们甚至断章取义地用毛主席语录去攻击对方。学风恶劣，达到了不可容忍的地步。这是第十条。
    由此可见，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，实是隐藏在我们革命队伍内的一个十分危险的敌人。它制造分裂，影响团结，瓦解斗志，危害革命，破坏生产，包庇坏人，助纣为虐，干尽坏事。大敌当前，我们必须打倒它。
    无产阶级文化大革命深入开展到今天，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是资产阶级疯狂反对无产阶级的一个重要武器。这决不是偶然的。现在，党内一小撮走资派在组织上把革命群众打成“反革命”这一手已破产了，经济上用反革命经济主义发动进攻也早已被识破了，于是，他们只能乞助于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这个幽灵。他们召唤出这个幽灵，打入到我们的革命队伍里来。列宁指出：“由工人运动内部的机会主义派别活动家来维护资产阶级，比资产者亲自出马还好。”资产阶级、小资产阶级派性起了党内一小撮走资派的别动队的作用。我们有的同志头脑里有“私”字，里外呼应，一拍即合。这些同志一旦作了资产阶级、小资产阶级的俘虏，被阶级敌人牵着鼻子走，还自以为“大方向正确”哩！
    资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，是一种反动性。逆革命潮流而动，叫做反动。无产阶级文化大革命的革命洪流滚滚向前，而资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这种反动思潮，却妄图阻碍革命洪流前进，这不是反动吗？“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的”。一切反动的东西都将被革命的洪流所冲走。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在一定的时候，能够蒙蔽一些人。一切受派性蒙蔽的同志，现在再也不能继续糊涂下去了，应该赶快醒悟过来，擦亮眼睛，反戈一击，完全彻底搞臭资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席统帅下的无产阶级文化革命大军，只有一派，就是无产阶级革命派！只有一性，就是无产阶级党性！只有用无产阶级的党性去指导自己的全部行动，才能永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进。
    打倒派性！斩断黑手！
    无产阶级革命派联合起来！
                                          （新华社十四日讯）
