The People's Liberation Army has made immortal contributions in carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks entrusted by Chairman Mao over the past year.

The entire army's officers and soldiers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, engage in irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, defeat the class enemies, and make greater contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, January 27th: The great helmsman Mao Zedong, who personally created and leads the unparalleled People's Liberation Army, personally commands, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao directly commands, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In carrying out the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting agriculture, supporting industry, military control, and military training entrusted by Chairman Mao, they have vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, armed billions of revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and ensured that every directive from Chairman Mao is implemented thoroughly and comprehensively. They have made tremendous contributions to the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and established new great merits.

"The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." In January last year, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution reached a critical moment of decisive struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the great helmsman Chairman Mao issued a battle order to the People's Liberation Army. Chairman Mao's decision of great strategic significance is the greatest trust, greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. "If Chairman Mao loves it, I love it; if Chairman Mao supports it, I support it; if Chairman Mao instructs, I act; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." The entire army was inspired, and tens of thousands of soldiers and officers supporting the left and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams marched to factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, and vast rural areas. In this fighting column, there were old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern campaigns, heroes and models who stood out in the struggle to defend the motherland, and new soldiers who grew rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported and protected the broad masses of the left, actively helped the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses carry out revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. They have made tremendous contributions to achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the "three supports" and "two militaries" work, the officers and soldiers have always regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses as the fundamental task. They have placed helping the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively at the highest, greatest, earliest, and most important position. After entering factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools, they first studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "three old articles" with the masses; they vigorously propagated "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao"; they actively assisted the masses in organizing the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The officers and soldiers gave the broad masses the most precious gift of Chairman Mao's works, brought the broad masses the most precious experience of studying Chairman Mao's works with questions, applying them actively, combining study with use, learning urgently what is needed first, and seeing immediate results by focusing on the "use"; they helped the broad masses establish the most precious institution of "daily reading" that is unshakable by thunder. The officers and soldiers stationed in various places vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's great wisdom, the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses. They helped the revolutionary masses hold exhibitions comparing the new society with the old society, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with the reactionary line of China's Khrushchev, and remembrance meetings of bitterness and sweetness. They aroused everyone's hatred for the old society and China's Khrushchev, increased everyone's love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and raised everyone's awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works. The troops stationed in the border areas formed batch after batch of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, climbing mountains and crossing rivers to bring Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses of the brotherly nationalities. Wherever they went, they left a red line, and wherever they stayed, they left a red area. In the places they visited, the scene of "politics leading the way, people and environment changing, thought revolutionizing, and enthusiasm breaking through the sky" appeared. The officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in cities went to workshops, visited dormitories, and conducted in-depth and detailed heart-to-heart talks, making Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses.

While vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the officers and soldiers paid special attention to thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the broad revolutionary masses. They studied, executed, and propagated every latest instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao earnestly, defended it bravely, and regarded helping the masses to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the standard to measure the "three supports" and "two militaries" work. They said, our responsibility is to spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the five lakes and four seas, making the revolutionary masses of the five lakes and four seas connect their hearts with the red line of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the officers and soldiers propagate them with the greatest enthusiasm, highest initiative, fastest action, and most effective measures, making Chairman Mao's voice directly reach the broad masses, quickly making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household, and known to everyone. Chairman Mao instructed: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The officers and soldiers of the local troops, while vigorously propagating this instruction, adhered to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, actively helped various revolutionary mass organizations overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, did solid work, and quickly launched a high tide of revolutionary great unity in these regions under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers vigorously propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, which must be solved well," making a large number of revolutionary leading cadres liberated from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line and shouldered the heavy responsibility of grasping the revolution and promoting production. Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the instruction to vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The "three supports" and "two militaries" personnel on various fronts swiftly helped various industries, departments, units, and mass organizations to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. On the vast land of the motherland, from cities to villages, from islands to plateaus, Mao Zedong Thought study classes sprouted like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army together broke bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in the study classes, fought against "self," established Mao Zedong Thought, and swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They are determined to achieve new merits in the struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao taught: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members, an issue of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, and an issue of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since it is so, the issue of study style is a very important issue, the first important issue." In the struggle practice, the officers and soldiers deeply felt that to make Mao Zedong Thought truly take root in the minds of the masses and make Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively implemented, it is necessary to establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao among the broad masses. When propagating Mao Zedong Thought and helping the masses study Chairman Mao's works, they repeatedly explained to the masses that studying Chairman Mao's works and using them or not, listening to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and implementing them or not, is a fundamental attitude and fundamental stance towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, a fundamental attitude and fundamental stance towards the revolutionary cause. The representatives of advanced units in studying Chairman Mao's works and the activists in studying Chairman Mao's works in various units often went to factories, rural areas, schools, and streets to introduce their experiences and insights in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use." The officers and soldiers assigned to support the left also enthusiastically helped various levels of revolutionary committees (preparatory groups), production front command departments, and various revolutionary mass organizations to timely check and summarize the situation and experiences of the broad revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, cultivate, and establish model units and exemplary figures in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad officers and soldiers fighting at the grassroots units often held experience exchange meetings and lectures on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students. They set an example by acting as models in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, setting a brilliant example for the broad revolutionary masses. "Do as Chairman Mao says, and go where Chairman Mao points." Under the help of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are turning Chairman Mao's latest instructions into conscious revolutionary actions. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is guiding everything, directing everything, and transforming everything on the vast territory of our great motherland.

"Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement." At present, the great People's Liberation Army, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, while vigilantly guarding the great motherland and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is seriously summarizing the experience of using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work. They are determined to further implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, engage in irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, defeat the class enemies, and make greater contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用伟大毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众
    人民解放军一年来在执行毛主席交给的“三支”“两军”工作中立下不朽功勋
    全军指战员决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性进行不调和的斗争，团结广大革命群众，战胜阶级敌人，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出更大贡献
    新华社二十七日讯　伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造亲自领导、林彪副统帅直接指挥的举世无双的中国人民解放军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在执行毛主席交给的支左、支农、支工、军管、军训的光荣任务中，大力宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装亿万革命群众，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大贡献，建立了新的伟大功勋。
      “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”去年一月间，当无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，伟大统帅毛主席向中国人民解放军发出了战斗号令。毛主席这一具有伟大战略意义的英明决策，是对人民解放军广大指战员的最大信任，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”全军上下，群情振奋，成千上万的解放军支左人员和毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡奔赴厂矿、企业、机关、学校和广大农村。在这战斗的行列里，有跟随毛主席转战南北的老红军战士，有在保卫祖国的斗争中立下战功的英雄、模范，有在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长的新战士。一年来，他们怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，大力宣传毛泽东思想，坚定地支持和保护左派广大群众，积极帮助无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命三结合，进行本单位的斗、批、改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为取得无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利作出了巨大贡献。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在“三支”“两军”工作中，指战员们自始至终地把用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众作为根本，把帮助群众活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置。他们进入工厂、农村、机关、学校后，首先和群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”；向群众大力宣传“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”；积极协助群众组织开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。指战员们送给广大群众最宝贵的礼物是毛主席著作，带给广大群众最宝贵的经验是学习毛主席著作要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫；帮助广大群众建立起来的最宝贵的制度是雷打不动的“天天读”。驻各地部队的支左人员，在广大群众中大讲特讲毛主席的英明伟大、毛泽东思想的无比威力和学习毛主席著作的重大意义，帮助革命群众举办新社会和旧社会、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线对比的展览会、忆苦思甜会，激发大家对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，增强大家对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，提高大家学习毛主席著作的自觉性。驻边疆部队组成一批又一批的毛泽东思想宣传队，爬山涉水，把毛泽东思想送给兄弟民族的革命群众。他们走起来红一线，住下来红一片。在他们到过的地方，出现了“政治领了先，人变环境变，思想革命化，干劲冲破天”的可喜景象。驻城市的部队指战员，走车间，串宿舍，深入细致地开展谈心活动，让毛泽东思想深深扎根在广大革命群众的心坎里。
    指战员们在大力宣传毛泽东思想的时候，特别重视在广大革命群众中扎扎实实地做落实毛主席最新指示的工作。他们对伟大领袖毛主席发出的每一项最新指示，都认真学习，忠实执行，热情宣传，勇敢捍卫，并且把帮助群众全面落实毛主席最新指示，当作检验“三支”“两军”工作的标准。他们说，我们的职责就是把毛主席的最新指示传播到五湖四海，使五湖四海的革命群众把心连在毛主席最新指示的红线上，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    每当毛主席的最新指示一下达，指战员们就以最大的热情，最高的积极性，最快的行动，最有效的措施，大力进行宣传，让毛主席的声音直接和广大群众见面，很快使毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，人人皆知。毛主席指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”各地驻军指战员在大力宣传这一指示的同时，坚持支左不支派的原则，积极帮助各革命群众组织克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，做扎扎实实的工作，使这些地区在毛泽东思想指引下，很快掀起了革命大联合的高潮。指战员们在广大群众中大力宣传、落实毛主席“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的最新指示，使大批的革命领导干部从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下解放出来，挑起了抓革命促生产的重担。我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，林彪副主席发出了大办毛泽东思想学习班的指示，在各条战线上的“三支”“两军”人员，雷厉风行地帮助各行业、各部门、各单位、各群众组织，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在祖国辽阔的土地上，从城市到山村，从海岛到高原，毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋一样涌现。亿万革命群众、革命干部和解放军指战员一道，在学习班里大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大斗“私”字，大立毛泽东思想，迅速落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中立新功。
    毛主席教导说：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”指战员们在斗争实践中，深深体会到，要使毛泽东思想真正在群众头脑中扎根，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实、全面落实，就必须在广大群众中树立毛主席倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风。他们在宣传毛泽东思想，帮助群众学习毛主席著作时，反复向群众说明，学了毛主席著作用不用，听了毛主席的最新指示执行不执行，是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的根本立场、根本态度问题，是对革命事业的根本立场、根本态度的问题。各部队学习毛主席著作先进单位代表和学习毛主席著作积极分子，经常到工厂、农村、学校、街道，介绍活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验和体会。担任支左任务的指战员，还热情帮助各级革命委员会（筹备小组）、生产第一线指挥部和各革命群众组织，及时检查、总结广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的情况和经验，培养、树立活学活用毛主席著作的典型单位和模范人物。战斗在基层单位的广大指战员，时常和工人、贫下中农、革命师生一起，召开活学活用毛主席著作经验交流会和讲用会。他们以身作则，处处做活学活用毛主席著作，执行毛主席最新指示的模范，给广大革命群众树立了光辉的榜样。“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。”“毛主席指向那里，我们就打到那里。”亿万革命群众在解放军指战员的帮助下，正在把毛主席的最新指示变成自觉的革命行动。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，正在我们伟大祖国的领土上统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切。
      “高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”目前，伟大的中国人民解放军，遵循林彪副统帅的指示，在警惕地保卫伟大祖国和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的同时，认真总结在“三支”“两军”工作中用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的经验，决心进一步贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性进行不调和的斗争，团结广大革命群众，战胜阶级敌人，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出更大贡献。
