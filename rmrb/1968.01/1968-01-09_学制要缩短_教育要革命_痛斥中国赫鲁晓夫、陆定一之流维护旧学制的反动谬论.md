Our great leader Chairman Mao has always advocated for shortening the school system. Since the liberation of the entire country, Chairman Mao has made many extremely important instructions on reforming the old school system. In 1966, Chairman Mao again taught us: "The school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao's series of great instructions have pointed out a clear direction for the proletarian education revolution.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field, such as Lu Dingyi, have been singing a different tune. The Chinese Khrushchev blabbers on about: "Do not rigidly specify the number of years; the curriculum must be completed." He also viciously attacks Chairman Mao, shouting: "If you are not sure, do not give blind orders." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi and others also shout: "Full-time higher education institutions generally do not shorten the school system." They use the educational leadership they have usurped to arrogantly order "three immovables," the first of which is "the length of study remains unchanged." This has resulted in the school system not only not being shortened in recent years but actually becoming longer. Originally short-term specialized schools have been abolished, accelerated secondary schools for workers and peasants have been cut, and higher education institutions have changed from four-year programs to five-year, six-year, and even eight-year programs. The decision of the Central Military Commission to universally shorten the school system in higher education institutions for national defense industries has also been fiercely resisted and opposed by them.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi, in order to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian education revolution thought and maintain the old school system, have spread many reactionary fallacies. The most widespread of these is the so-called "improving educational quality." The Chinese Khrushchev shouts: "How many years are enough to study? It should be calculated by hours; if it takes a few years, then it takes a few years. In short, the quality cannot be reduced." Lu Dingyi also blathers on about "education is first and foremost the transmission and learning of knowledge," "to enable students to obtain a relatively complete knowledge," and puts forward the slogan of "improving educational quality" for schools.

Do we want to "improve educational quality"? Of course, we do. The question is, what kind of educational quality and whose class's educational quality. The "educational quality" spoken of by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices is the educational quality of the bourgeoisie, which is to cultivate qualified successors for the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates, "to learn a professional knowledge, one must put long-term study in the first place." Therefore, in their eyes, the school system must be long.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi desperately prolong the school system, making students detached from proletarian politics, detached from reality, and detached from workers and peasants. They let the young people's prime time, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, be wasted in piles of books, reading a lot and dead reading, becoming spiritual aristocrats who stand above the laboring people. Some students reflect that they are like three-door students in school: classroom door, dining hall door, dormitory door; outside they are three-door cadres: home door, school door, office door. Students trained in this way often do not labor, do not know the five grains, look down on labor, are detached from the workers and peasants, and do not want to work in hard places. The "educational quality" "improved" in this way is absolutely not the educational quality we proletarians need.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi desperately prolong the school system to instill feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into students for a long time and in large quantities. Lu Dingyi says: "Students should first learn feudalist culture, learn capitalist culture, and then learn socialist culture." This is the counter-revolutionary confession of "systematic and complete knowledge." Ask, if the students' minds are filled with feudalist and capitalist culture, where can they accept socialist culture? Under this pretext, they make the curriculum more and more, the content more and more complicated, and the extracurricular assignments heavier. Bourgeois intellectuals use lectures to peddle a large amount of private goods, poisoning the youth. Some even guide students to study: "Why does the character 'jade' have a dot, why does the character 'seven' have a hook, and why does the character 'ten' not have a hook," and say this is a great "scholarship." As Lenin said, the old school "forces students to learn a lot of useless, cumbersome, rigid knowledge," "fills the minds of young people with boundless, nine-tenths useless and one-tenth distorted knowledge."

The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi desperately prolong the school system, also to exclude workers and peasants and their children, and to implement dictatorship over workers and peasants. Because the longer the school system, the fewer opportunities there are for the vast majority of workers and peasants' children to enter school due to production needs and economic reasons.

The proletariat's requirement for educational quality is to cultivate reliable successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause, and "the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggle, and are tempered and grown in the great storms of revolution." Therefore, the school system must be shortened.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning." Therefore, school education must implement the principle of "few but excellent," and the teaching content and methods must be targeted and combine learning with use. Students in school should actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, lay a foundation in moral education, intellectual education, and physical education in a relatively short time, and then throw themselves into practical struggles to temper and grow. The history of our revolutionary wars proves that our military personnel who have not been to school or have not read much have defeated the reactionary officers who graduated from the Nationalist Party's Military Academy, defeated the Japanese militarists who were armed to the teeth, and in the world-renowned War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, defeated the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism. The history of the development of science and technology in our country also fully proves that young scientific workers and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, without the bourgeois "academicians" and "doctors" titles, following the great policy of striving to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level of science and technology, formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, have, in a relatively short time, successfully researched and manufactured the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb. Their development speed greatly surpassed that of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Cultivating successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause requires the establishment of a new school system. The world-renowned "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" is a model of implementing the revolutionary new school system, a very revolutionary and very combat-ready new-type school that embodies Chairman Mao's educational thoughts. It has cultivated a large number of outstanding talents for the proletariat and created important conditions for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

Our struggle with the handful of capitalist roaders within the party on the issue of the school system is not just a struggle over the length of study time, but a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths on the educational front, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the leadership of education and the younger generation. We must seize the opportunity to shorten the school system and thoroughly reform the old educational system.

The educational revolution thought of our great leader Chairman Mao is an important part of Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant creative development of Marxism-Leninism, and has epoch-making significance for eliminating the bourgeois educational system and establishing the proletarian educational system. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the old educational system, and thoroughly eliminate the various fallacies spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in defending the old school system.

    学制要缩短　教育要革命
    ——痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫、陆定一之流维护旧学制的反动谬论
    国防科委直属机关无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大领袖毛主席历来主张缩短学制。全国解放以来，毛主席对改革旧学制做了许多极其重要的指示。一九六六年毛主席又教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的一系列伟大指示，给无产阶级教育革命指出了明确的方向。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人陆定一之流却一直大唱反调。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“不要死规定几年，必须学完课程”。他还恶毒地攻击毛主席，叫嚷什么：“看不准，千万不要瞎指挥”。反革命修正主义分子陆定一等也纷纷叫嚷：“全日制高等学校在学制上一般不缩短。”他们利用所篡夺的教育领导权，狂妄地限令“三不动”，首先就是“学习年限不动”。这就使得近几年来，学制不但没有缩短，反而越来越长。原来学制较短的专科被取消了，工农速成中学被砍掉了，高等院校的四年制改成了五年制、六年制甚至八年制。中央军委关于国防工业高等院校普遍缩短学制的决定，也遭到了他们的疯狂抵制和反对。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，为了对抗毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想，维护旧学制，散布了许多反动的谬论。其中流毒最广的是所谓“提高教育质量”。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚣：“到底学多少年就够了，要按学时算，该几年就几年。总之，质量不能降低。”陆定一也胡说什么“教育首先是传授和学习知识”，“使学生得到比较完全的知识”，并提出了学校要“提高教育质量”的口号。
    要“提高教育质量”吗？当然是要的。问题是提高什么样的教育质量，哪个阶级的教育质量。中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙所说的“教育质量”，是资产阶级的教育质量，是为资产阶级培养合格的接班人的。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬，“要学一门专业知识”，“必须把长期学习放在第一位”。因此，在他们看来，学制必须长。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流拚命延长学制，使学生脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际、脱离工农兵。他们让青年的好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳的大好时光都消耗在书堆里，多读书、死读书，成为高踞于劳动人民之上的精神贵族。有的学生反映，他们在学校是三门学生：教室门、饭堂门、宿舍门；出去是三门干部：家门、校门、机关门。这样培养出来的学生，往往四体不勤，五谷不分，轻视劳动，脱离工农群众，不愿到艰苦的地方去工作。沿着这样的路子“提高”的“教育质量”，绝不是我们无产阶级所需要的教育质量。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流拚命延长学制，是为了长时期地大量地向学生灌输封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的思想。陆定一说：“学生要先学封建主义文化，学资本主义文化，再学社会主义文化”。这就是所谓“知识的系统性、完整性”的反革命自白。试问：学生头脑里灌满了封建主义和资本主义文化，哪里还能接受社会主义文化？他们在这个幌子下，使课程越来越多，内容越来越繁，课外作业越来越重。资产阶级知识分子利用讲课大量贩卖私货，毒害青年。有的竟引导学生去研究：“‘玉’字为什么有一点，‘七’字为什么有一勾，‘十’字为什么没有勾”，还说这是很大的“学问”。正如列宁所说，旧学校“强迫学生学一大堆无用的、累赘的、死板的知识”，“用无边无际的、九分无用一分歪曲了的知识来充塞青年的头脑”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流拚命延长学制，也是为了排斥工农及其子弟，对工农实行专政。因为学制越长，广大工农子弟由于生产需要和经济原因，入学的机会就越少。
    无产阶级对教育质量的要求，是为无产阶级革命事业培养可靠的接班人，而“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”因此，学制必须缩短。
    毛主席教导我们：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”因此，学校教育必须实行“少而精”的原则，在教学内容和教学方法上必须要有针对性，学用结合。学生在学校里，活学活用毛主席著作，以较短时间，在德育、智育、体育几方面打下基础以后，就投身到实际斗争中去锻炼成长。我国革命战争的历史证明，没有进过学校或读书不多的我军指战员，打败了国民党陆军大学毕业的反动军官，打败了武装到牙齿的日本军国主义，在举世闻名的抗美援朝战争中打败了世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义。我国科学技术的发展史也充分证明，没有资产阶级的“院士”、“博士”头衔的青年科学工作者和广大革命群众、革命干部，遵照伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席制定的鼓足干劲，力争上游，自力更生，奋发图强，树雄心，立大志，赶超世界先进科学技术水平的伟大方针，在较短的时间内，研究制造成功了原子弹、氢弹，其发展速度，大大地超过了美帝和苏修。
    培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，需要建立新的学制。世界闻名的“抗大”，就是实行革命的新学制的一个典范，是体现了毛主席教育思想的非常革命化、非常战斗化的新型学校。她为无产阶级培养了大批优秀人才，为抗日战争和解放战争的胜利创造了重要条件。
    我们同党内最大的一小撮走资派在学制问题上的斗争，决不只是学习时间长短之争，而是教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺教育领导权、争夺青年一代的斗争。我们必须抓紧缩短学制这一环，彻底改革旧的教育制度。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的教育革命思想，是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是马克思列宁主义天才的创造性的发展，对于破除资产阶级的教育制度，建立无产阶级教育制度具有划时代的重大意义。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底批判旧的教育制度，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资派维护旧学制所散布的各种谬论的流毒。
