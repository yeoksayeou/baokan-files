	Faithfully Carry Out Chairman Mao's Great Battle Commandment
	Firmly Uphold the Principle of Supporting the Left but Not Supporting Factions
	—In Memory of the First Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Call for the People's Liberation Army to Support the Broad Masses of the Left

	The great leader Chairman Mao has called upon us: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left."

	The task of the army in supporting the left, fundamentally, is to support the left with Mao Zedong Thought. Regardless of which faction the revolutionary masses belong to, as long as their words and actions align with Mao Zedong Thought, we will support them. Otherwise, we will not support them and will help and correct them. We can only support the left and absolutely not support factions. This is the fundamental principle and stance of our work in supporting the left.

	Using the perspective of class struggle to analyze the new characteristics of class struggle in the new situation

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, ... they have long-term experience in class struggle, they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal and illegal. We revolutionary party members must understand their tactics, must study their strategies, in order to defeat them." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly analyze the political situation, closely monitor the new moves of the class enemy, firmly grasp the new characteristics of class struggle, so as not to lose direction in the complex struggle, consciously follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seize the initiative in class struggle, and win the victory of the struggle.

	We analyze all social phenomena and cannot separate them from the fundamental source of class struggle. Using Mao Zedong Thought for social investigation and class analysis, we clearly see that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is intertwined with the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the class enemies inside and outside the Party to undermine the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the new situation where the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victory and the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev has collapsed, the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders within the Party, along with the class enemies in society, unwilling to accept defeat, use bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to sow discord and create divisions within the proletarian headquarters. This handful of class enemies, some disguised as "rebels" and openly fighting; some plotting behind the scenes, using the factionalism of the masses to create divisions, instigate "civil war," and try to muddy the waters, fish in troubled waters, and achieve their evil goal of undermining the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some people in the mass organizations, with their factionalism swelling, do not analyze major political issues from a class perspective. Those who agree with my views are good people, otherwise, they are all to be overthrown, without distinguishing between friends and enemies. True friends are excluded and attacked, while class enemies take advantage of the situation. They become the mouthpieces of the class enemies.

	The class enemy has used factionalism, and factionalism has helped the class enemy. This is the new characteristic of class struggle at present. In this new situation, it is crucial to seriously implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions. This is related to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If we do not adhere to this principle and simply lean towards one faction, we will lead the "three supports" and "two militaries" work astray, deepen the opposition between the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations, damage military-civilian unity, and hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

	We have adhered to the revolutionary principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions in dealing with the two major factions of revolutionary masses in Anhui. We use Mao Zedong Thought to help the two factions unite and jointly fight against the enemy. Some people think, is this not muddying the waters and not having a clear banner? We believe: supporting the left but not supporting factions, is to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, from the overall interests of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, adhere to principles, adhere to struggle, and have the clearest banner. On the contrary, without this fundamental principle, without class analysis of the actions of the two factions, without distinguishing right from wrong, blindly supporting both, this is truly muddying the waters and compromising.

	Some people have asked: if you do not support one faction, will you not have a reliance? We believe: relying on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, relying on the broad revolutionary masses who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, is the greatest reliance. If you support one faction and suppress another, you will lead the "three supports" and "two militaries" work astray and lose the greatest reliance.

	Some people say: you sometimes support this faction, sometimes support that faction, without principles. We say, supporting the left but not supporting factions, is absolutely not about supporting both sides without principles. If one faction does something a thousand times according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will support them a thousand times; if one faction engages in factional activities once, we will not support that one factional activity. This is how we adhere to the principles of proletarian party spirit.

	Some people who were misled and made mistakes in the past want to take this opportunity to reverse their mistakes. We solemnly point out: when there was a struggle between revolution and preservation in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, we firmly supported the left, supported them in uniting, educating, and winning over the misled masses, and the overall direction was completely correct. We absolutely do not allow anyone to distort the revolutionary principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions, deny the overall direction of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and deny the overall direction of the army supporting the left.

	In our work of supporting the left, we have adhered to the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions, always kept our heads clear, and closely monitored the new trends and characteristics of class struggle. No matter what tricks the class enemy plays, no matter how fierce the factional impact, we do not lose our way, always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and thus firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle.

	Using proletarian party spirit to transform bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the revolutionary track of the proletariat. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a concentrated expression of individualism, sectarianism, anarchism, and feudalism, a reactionary bourgeois ideology. It is a poisonous snake that harms revolutionary masses and is extremely harmful. We adhere to the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions, which is to adhere to proletarian party spirit and use Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. This is a reflection of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the ideological realm, and it is a major issue of whether to use the worldview of the proletariat to transform the world or to use the worldview of the bourgeoisie to transform the world.

	The practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made us deeply realize that in this extremely complex and sharp class struggle, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has been going on fiercely. Some people, incited and instigated by class enemies, have factional outbursts. Most of these people are still issues of ideological awareness. Therefore, we should handle them according to Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, using the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," both adhere to principles and patiently guide, do good and painstaking ideological and political work, and guide petty-bourgeois ideology to the revolutionary track of the proletariat.

	Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are best at using beautiful words to dress themselves up and using countless big hats to frighten others. If one is weak and vague in the face of factionalism, this is to abandon proletarian party spirit, encourage bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, harm the masses, and harm the revolution. For any factional activities, we must seriously point them out and criticize and help them.

	Transforming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an extremely complex and arduous task, and without strong confidence, it is not possible. On the one hand, we must see the ideological and social roots of factionalism and see that factionalism has a certain degree of infiltration; on the other hand, we must see that the broad revolutionary people, after long-term nurturing by Mao Zedong Thought, have high awareness, and proletarian party spirit is the mainstream. Proletarian party spirit will definitely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, which is an objective law that is not subject to human will. As long as we persistently arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, factionalism will definitely be overcome soon.

	How to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism? We have adopted the methods of "discussion, persuasion, criticism, and self-criticism. In a word, only democratic methods, letting the masses speak." When the masses come to us or ask us to listen to their opinions, no matter how their attitudes are, whether they speak good or bad words, we sit still, listen carefully, do not get impatient, do not get angry, and let them finish speaking. From patiently listening to the opinions of the masses, we discover advanced thoughts that conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, and we humbly learn from the masses, eliminate all interference, and firmly support them, using the advanced things in the masses to educate the masses. If the criticisms raised by the masses are indeed our shortcomings, we do not dodge or avoid them, dare to admit them, and seriously correct them, using the lessons from our work to educate the masses. Some factional elements in the revolutionary masses, if they cannot be persuaded for the time being, how should we deal with them? We believe: principles must be adhered to, and factionalism cannot be indulged. However, we must consider the level of awareness of the masses and cannot commit commandism. Our principle is: if there is a problem, insist on democratic consultation. The process of consultation is the process of persuading and educating with Mao Zedong Thought, and the process of seeking common ground while reserving differences and uniting the broad masses. Practice has proven: only by putting down the official airs, immersing oneself in the struggle of the masses, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and being willing to be a small student of the masses, can one guide the masses to eliminate factionalism in the struggle of the masses.

	The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon to overcome all non-proletarian thoughts, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are the lighthouse guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory. The process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the broad revolutionary masses is the process of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the process of completely burying bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. In the practical struggle, we clearly see that factionalism is serious only among a few people, and they are being hindered by the poisonous snake of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, becoming obstacles to the advancement of the revolution. We should help them with great enthusiasm and patience, organize them to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, overcome factionalism, and become true proletarian revolutionaries, not ephemeral figures. Whether factionalism can be eliminated from the revolutionary mass organizations depends on the working class and the broad revolutionary people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, whenever Chairman Mao issues the latest instructions, we mobilize all available forces with the highest enthusiasm, greatest determination, and fastest speed to spread Chairman Mao's voice to factories, rural areas, schools, and the hearts of revolutionary masses. We organize revolutionary leaders at all levels, combat heroes, and active members of studying Chairman Mao's works to go to the streets and share their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the broad masses, take the lead in criticizing and reforming themselves. We mobilize the masses to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the army sets them up, the local areas set them up, and the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations set them up together, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

	The broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary masses love Mao Zedong Thought the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most. Once they master Mao Zedong Thought, they can consciously fight against factionalism. In factories, rural areas, schools, offices, and streets in Hefei, Huainan, and Ma'anshan, everywhere is a battlefield of criticizing and reforming oneself. The broad revolutionary masses speak out about the harm of factionalism and list the crimes of factionalism, criticizing and exposing factionalism. When the class enemy incites division and sabotages the great alliance, the broad revolutionary masses launch united actions, beating drums and gongs to report to the army. When the class enemy uses factionalism to sabotage production, the broad workers, peasants, and family members launch a high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production with the greatest enthusiasm. The broad revolutionary masses in Huainan City also formulated a pact: not to hold factional meetings, not to engage in factional activities, consciously go out to propagate, and perform programs to overcome factionalism. The masses have risen up, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are in a passive position like rats crossing the street, being chased and beaten by everyone, losing their market. The great alliance is more consolidated and developed, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

	According to Chairman Mao's military building principles, we have built the army to be highly proletarian and highly combat-ready.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reason why this army is powerful is that all those who join this army have conscious discipline; they are not fighting for the private interests of a few or a narrow group, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the whole nation, to unite and fight. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." Our army's execution of the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks is to implement Chairman Mao's military building principles and strengthen the revolutionary and combat-ready construction of our army. Supporting the left but not supporting factions is stipulated by our military building principles. We can only serve all the people of China and all the people of the world, serve the entire proletariat, and absolutely cannot serve any narrow small group; we can only take proletarian party spirit as the criterion and absolutely cannot be swayed by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

	First, we must pay attention to resisting the infiltration of factionalism, preventing the influence of factionalism, and always maintaining the clear banner of proletarian party spirit. We are the people's army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and has a high degree of proletarian party spirit. We absolutely cannot allow even a trace of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Therefore, in our work of supporting the left, no matter how heavy the tasks are or how complex the situations are, we always insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, highlighting proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and focusing on the ideological revolutionization of the troops. We deeply study Chairman Mao's military building principles, deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focus on the education of the two-line struggle, and carry out the ideological revolutionization of breaking private interests and establishing public interests. Therefore, we have resisted the influence of factionalism, maintained proletarian party spirit, and adhered to the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions.

	Only by cultivating the selfless proletarian feelings of the troops can we enhance proletarian party spirit and resist the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. We can only love what the proletariat loves and cannot only love what one faction loves. We can only let the troops be nurtured by the most sincere class feelings of the proletariat and absolutely cannot let the troops be infiltrated by the factional feelings of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie. To cultivate and enhance the proletarian feelings of the troops, we let the cadres and soldiers study, labor, recall bitterness and think sweetly, and criticize and reform themselves with the two factions of broad revolutionary masses. The more we come into contact with the two factions of broad revolutionary masses, the more open our hearts are, the more clearly we see that the two factions of broad revolutionary masses are our class brothers, and the more we enhance our feelings for the two factions of revolutionary masses. When one faction says something unpleasant to us because of being misled, we educate the troops to always believe that the majority of the masses are good and always hold high the banner of loving the people. The more the masses have opinions about us, the more we go to approach them. From the leaders to the soldiers, we generally go deep into the families and dormitories to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses and exchange opinions. We do not calculate personal honor, danger, or pressure, remain unshaken, and do not favor one side in the face of praise. No matter which faction of revolutionary masses we face, under any circumstances, we always do not catch factionalism and always adhere to the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies. This high level of love for the people is a manifestation of party spirit. Soldiers who can withstand such tests are reliable soldiers. Such soldiers have the strongest discipline, love the people the most, and are the most loyal to Chairman Mao.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the broadest, deepest, and greatest socialist revolution. The various old forces and old ideas of the exploiting classes all fiercely attack the main pillar of proletarian dictatorship—the great People's Liberation Army. In a certain sense, this attack is much more complex, sharp, and profound than the gun-to-gun, sword-to-sword fighting in the war years. Under such circumstances, adhering to the principles of proletarian party spirit, firmly supporting the left but not supporting factions, and resisting the impact from the right or the "extreme left," is an extremely severe test and a great tempering for our supporting-left troops. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communist Party members should experience wind and rain, see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has deeply touched people's souls. The shocking class struggle has greatly tempered the revolutionary soldiers' firm will to resist corruption and risks and forged their red hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. The People's Liberation Army that has experienced this storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be invincible in the world!

    忠实执行毛主席的伟大战斗号令
    认真坚持支左不支派的原则
    ——纪念毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”伟大号召一周年
    六四○八部队党委
    伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”
    部队支左，从根本意义上说，就是用毛泽东思想支持左派。无论是那一派的革命群众，凡是符合毛泽东思想的言论行动，我们就支持。否则，我们就不支持，就帮助、纠正。我们只能支左，绝不支派。这就是我们支左工作的根本原则和立场。
    用阶级斗争观点分析新形势下阶级斗争的新特点
    毛主席教导我们：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，……他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。”我们必须按照毛主席的教导，不断分析政治形势，密切注意阶级敌人的新动向，紧紧抓住阶级斗争的新特点，才能在复杂的斗争中不迷失方向，自觉地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握阶级斗争的主动权，赢得斗争的胜利。
    我们分析一切社会现象，都离不开阶级斗争这个总根源。用毛泽东思想作社会调查和阶级分析，就清醒地看到，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是同党内一小撮走资派，同党内外的阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋活动交织在一起的。在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部取得决定性胜利，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部已经土崩瓦解的新形势下，混在内部的一小撮叛徒、特务，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和社会上的阶级敌人，不甘心失败，利用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性向无产阶级司令部进行挑拨离间。这一小撮阶级敌人，有的披上“造反”外衣，赤膊上阵；有的幕后策划，利用群众的派性，制造分裂，挑起
  “内战”，企图把水搅浑，从中渔利，达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。群众组织中某些派性膨胀的人，对一些重大政治问题不作阶级分析，凡是赞同我的观点的都是好人，否则就一概打倒，敌我不分，真正的朋友遭到排斥和打击，阶级敌人却乘机而入。他们成了阶级敌人的传声筒。
    阶级敌人利用了派性，派性帮助了阶级敌人，这是当前阶级斗争的新特点。在这种新形势下，认真执行支左不支派的原则，这是关系到全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键。如果不坚持这个原则，简单地倾向一派，那就会把
  “三支”“两军”工作引上邪路，加深两派革命群众组织的对立，损害军民的团结，妨碍毛主席伟大战略部署的实现。
    我们对安徽两大派革命群众组织，坚持支左不支派的革命原则，用毛泽东思想帮助两派联合起来，共同对敌。有人想，这是不是和稀泥，旗帜不鲜明？我们认为：支左不支派，是以毛主席的最新指示为纲，从无产阶级文化大革命的整体利益出发，坚持原则，坚持斗争，旗帜最鲜明。相反，离开这个根本原则，对两派的所作所为，不作阶级分析，不分青红皂白，一律支持，这才是搞调和，和稀泥。
    有人提出：不支持一派，会不会使自己没有依靠？我们认为：依靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，依靠无限忠于毛主席的广大革命群众，是最大的依靠。如果支一派，压一派，就会把“三支”“两军”工作引上邪路，就会失去最大的依靠。
    有人说：你们有时支持这一派，有时支持那一派，没有原则。我们说，支左不支派，绝不是搞无原则的对等支持。那一派有一千次按毛泽东思想办事，我们就支持一千次；那一派有一次搞派性活动，我们就不支持它这一次派性活动。这样做正是坚持了无产阶级党性的原则。
    有一些过去受了蒙蔽，犯了错误的人想乘机为他们的错误翻案。我们严正指出：当文化大革命初期存在革和保的斗争时，我们坚决支持左派，支持他们去团结、教育、争取受蒙蔽的群众，大方向完全正确。绝不容许任何人歪曲支左不支派的革命原则，否定无产阶级革命派的大方向，否定部队支左的大方向。
    我们在支左工作中，坚持支左不支派，始终保持头脑清醒，随时密切注视阶级斗争的新动向，新特点。不管阶级敌人玩弄什么花招，不管派性冲击多么厉害，都不迷失方向，始终把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派，这就牢牢掌握了阶级斗争的主动权。
      用无产阶级党性改造资产阶级
    小资产阶级派性
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是个人主义、宗派主义、无政府主义、封建主义的集中表现，是一种反动的资产阶级思潮。它是一条毒蛇，毒害革命群众，危害极大。我们坚持支左不支派的原则，就是坚持无产阶级党性，坚持用毛泽东思想打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。这是思想领域内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的反映，是关系到用无产阶级的世界观来改造世界，还是用资产阶级的世界观来改造世界的大问题。
    无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到，在这场极其复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争中，资产阶级同无产阶级的斗争，一直在激烈地进行着。有些人受阶级敌人挑拨、煽动，派性发作。这些人绝大多数还是思想认识问题。所以，我们对他们应该按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，既要坚持原则，又要耐心引导，做好艰苦细致的思想政治工作，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，最善于用华丽的词句把自己装扮起来，用数不清的大帽子吓唬别人。如果在派性面前软弱无力，含糊其词，这就是放弃无产阶级党性，助长资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，害了群众，也害了革命。凡是派性活动，就要对他们严肃指出，进行批评和帮助。
    改造资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是一项极其复杂艰苦的工作，没有坚强的信心是不行的。我们一方面要看到派性的思想根源和社会根源，看到派性具有一定的侵蚀力；另一方面，更要看到广大革命人民，长期在毛泽东思想哺育下，有很高的觉悟，无产阶级的党性是主流。无产阶级党性，必将战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。只要我们坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想武装群众，派性一定会很快地得到克服。
    如何克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性？我们采取了“讨论的方法，说理的方法，批评和自我批评的方法。一句话，只能用民主的方法，让群众讲话的方法”。群众找上门来，或者要我们去听他们的意见，不管态度怎样，讲的是好话还是坏话，我们都坐得住，听得进，不急躁，不动气，让人把话说完。从耐心听取群众的意见中，发现符合毛主席教导的先进思想，就虚心向群众学习，排除一切干扰，坚决支持，用群众中的先进事物教育群众。如果群众提出的批评，确实是我们的缺点，我们就不敷衍回避，敢于承认，认真改正，用自己工作中的教训教育群众。革命群众中有些派性的东西，一时说服不了，怎样对待呢？我们认为：原则要坚持，派性不能迁就。但是，必须照顾群众的觉悟程度，不能犯命令主义。我们采取的原则是：有问题，坚持民主协商。协商的过程，就是用毛泽东思想说服教育的过程，就是求大同存小异、团结广大群众的过程。事实证明：只有放下官架子，投身到群众斗争中去，相信群众，依靠群众，甘当群众的小学生，才能在群众斗争中引导群众清除派性。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是克服一切非无产阶级思想的最强大的思想武器，毛主席的一系列最新指示，是指导无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的灯塔。毛主席最新指示在广大革命群众中全面落实的过程，就是无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的过程，就是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性被彻底埋葬的过程。在斗争实践中，我们清楚地看到，派性严重的只是少数人，他们被资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这条毒蛇缠住，正在成为革命前进的阻力。我们应当用极大的热情和耐心去帮助他们，组织他们参加毛泽东思想学习班，克服派性，成为真正的无产阶级革命派，不致成为昙花一现的人物。能不能清除革命群众组织中的派性，起决定作用的要靠掌握了毛泽东思想的工人阶级和广大革命人民。因此，每当毛主席发出最新指示，我们就用最高的热情、最大的决心、最快的速度，调动一切可以调动的力量，把毛主席的声音传到工厂、农村、学校，传到革命群众的心坎上。我们组织各级革命领导干部、战斗英雄、学习毛主席著作积极分子，在街头向广大群众讲用学习毛主席的最新指示的体会，带头斗私批修。我们发动群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，军队办，地方办，两派革命群众组织一起办，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。
    广大工人、贫下中农、革命群众最热爱毛泽东思想，最听毛主席的话。他们一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就能自觉地同派性作斗争。在合肥、淮南、马鞍山等地工厂、农村、学校、机关、街道，到处是斗私批修的战场，广大革命群众大讲派性的危害，大列派性的罪状，把派性批倒斗臭。阶级敌人挑动分裂，破坏革命大联合，广大革命群众就大搞联合行动，敲锣打鼓向部队报喜。阶级敌人利用派性破坏生产，广大工人、农民、家属，就以最大的热情，掀起抓革命、促生产的高潮。淮南市广大革命群众还制订了公约：不开派性会议，不搞派性活动，自觉上街宣传，演出克服派性的节目。群众起来了，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就处于老鼠过街、人人喊打的被动地位，失去了它的市场。革命大联合更加巩固和发展，革命和生产形势越来越好。
    按照毛主席的建军宗旨，把部队建设得非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化
    毛主席教导我们：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我军执行“三支”“两军”任务，是贯彻毛主席的建军宗旨，加强我军革命化、战斗化建设的重大战略措施。支左不支派，是我军建军宗旨所规定的。我们只能为全中国人民和全世界人民服务，为整个无产阶级服务，绝不能为某一个狭隘的小集团服务；只能以无产阶级党性为准则，绝不能为资产阶级、小资产阶级派性所左右。
    坚持支左不支派的原则，首先，我们自己必须注意抵制派性的侵蚀，防止派性的影响，时刻保持无产阶级党性的鲜明旗帜。我们是无限忠于毛主席的、具有高度无产阶级党性的人民军队，绝对不能容许沾染一丝一毫资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性。因此，我们在支左工作中，无论任务如何繁重，情况怎样复杂，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，狠抓部队的思想革命化。我们大学毛主席的建军宗旨，大学毛主席的最新指示，大抓两条路线斗争的教育，大搞破私立公的思想革命化。因而我们抵制了派性的影响，保持了无产阶级的党性，坚持了支左不支派的原则。
    培养部队大公无私的无产阶级感情，才能增强无产阶级党性，抵制资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响。我们只能是爱无产阶级所爱，不能是只爱一派所爱。我们只能让部队接受无产阶级最真挚的阶级感情的熏陶，绝不能让部队受资产阶级、小资产阶级派性感情的侵蚀。为了培养和增强部队的无产阶级感情，我们让干部、战士同两派广大革命群众同学习，同劳动，一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修。越是接触两派广大革命群众，心胸越开阔，越是清醒地看到两派广大革命群众都是自己的阶级兄弟，越来越增强对两派革命群众的感情。当一派有人受到蒙蔽对我们说了不好听的话的时候，我们教育部队始终坚信绝大多数群众是好的，始终高举爱民的旗帜。群众越是对我们有意见，我们越是去接近他们。从领导到战士，普遍深入到家庭、宿舍去同群众谈心，交换意见。我们不计个人荣辱安危，压力面前不动摇，赞扬声中不偏心。面对任何一派的革命群众，不管在任何情况下，始终不沾染派性，始终坚持宣传毛泽东思想和党的政策。这种高度的爱民观念，就是党性的表现。经得起这种考验的战士，是过硬的战士。这样的战士最有纪律性，最热爱人民，最忠于毛主席。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场最广泛、最深刻、最伟大的社会主义革命，剥削阶级的各种旧势力、旧思想无不向着无产阶级专政的主要支柱——伟大的中国人民解放军进行猛烈的冲击。这种冲击在一定意义上说，要比战争年代，枪对枪、刀对刀的冲杀要复杂得多，尖锐得多，深刻得多。在这种情况下，坚持无产阶级党性原则，坚决支左不支派，抗住来自右的或极
  “左”方面的冲击，对于我们支左部队是极其严峻的考验和极大的锻炼。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨，最深刻地触动了人们的灵魂。惊心动魄的阶级斗争，极大地锻炼了革命战士拒腐蚀、抗风险的坚强意志，冶炼了无限忠于毛主席的赤胆红心。经受过这场无产阶级文化大革命暴风雨的中国人民解放军，更将无敌于天下！
