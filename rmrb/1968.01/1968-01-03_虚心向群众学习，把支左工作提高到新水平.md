The New Year's editorials of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *PLA Daily* state: "Further implementing Chairman Mao's great call for 'supporting the army and loving the people,' and strengthening military-civilian unity is an important guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is entirely correct. All our officers and soldiers are determined to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, further deepen the "supporting the army and loving the people" activities in leftist support work, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, raise the level of leftist support work to a new height, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The past year was a year of struggle and victory. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the people and the army across the country united as one, defeated the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, and achieved decisive victories. In the course of leftist support work, we deeply felt that only by grasping Chairman Mao's fundamental thought of trusting and relying on the masses can we truly understand and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Last March, when we first arrived in Hongwei District, Tianjin, we were warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. Under these circumstances, some comrades regarded themselves as "referees" and hastily expressed their opinions. Facing this situation, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on the mass line and military-civilian relations, and realized that the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat love Chairman Mao the most, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are the most familiar with the situation of the Cultural Revolution, and have the richest experience in fighting against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. Before them, we must not consider ourselves superior; instead, we should be humble students. Therefore, we actively invited advanced individuals who study and apply Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences; we went deep into workshops and teams to listen to the proletarian revolutionaries expose and denounce the heinous crimes of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party; we went into dormitories to listen to the bitter experiences and sweet memories of the old workers. Through these activities, we deeply felt that the proletarian revolutionaries love Chairman Mao the most and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Their deep class feelings and clear class stance further strengthened our leftist stance and enhanced our leftist feelings, with a single heart loving the leftists and a single heart supporting the leftists.

We are willing to be humble students of the revolutionary masses, not only learning from them in thought but also seeking their advice when there are problems in leftist support work. There are many factories, offices, and schools in Hongwei District, but the first batch of factories we entered was less than one-tenth of the total in the district. Under these circumstances, how can we quickly spread Mao Zedong Thought to various units? We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes" and discussed this problem with the revolutionary masses. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes suggested organizing a workers' amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda network. They said: We should not only help each other in the study classes, but after returning to the factories, the factories should also continue to practice "one helps one" and "one red pair." We promptly adopted the masses' suggestions and, together with them, practiced "one helps one" and "one red pair," ensuring that if one factory does well, all factories learn from it, and if one factory has problems, all factories help together. In this way, through collective wisdom and efforts, we promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" throughout the district. We also established a system of regularly listening to the masses' opinions and regularly reporting to the masses, consciously placing ourselves under the masses' supervision to improve leftist support work.

Military-civilian unity is invincible; let's see who can defeat us! In the new year, we will take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and, together with the broad proletarian revolutionaries, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    虚心向群众学习，把支左工作提高到新水平

    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论说：“进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于‘拥军爱民’的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。”这是完全正确的。我们全体指战员决心以毛主席的最新指示为纲，在支左工作中进一步深入开展“拥军爱民”活动，虚心向革命群众学习，把支左工作提高到一个新的水平，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    过去的一年，是战斗的一年，胜利的一年。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，全国军民团结如一人，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派打得落花流水，取得了决定性的胜利。在支左工作中，我们深深体会到，只有掌握了毛主席相信群众、依靠群众这个根本思想，才能真正领会和贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把文化大革命进行到底。
    去年三月，我们刚到天津市红卫区，就受到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。在这种情况下，有少数同志以“裁判员”自居，急急忙忙表态。针对这种情况，我们反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于群众路线和军民关系的光辉论述，认识到广大无产阶级革命派对毛主席最热爱，对毛主席的革命路线最忠诚，对文化革命的情况最熟悉，对党内一小撮走资派斗争的经验最丰富。在他们面前，我们决不可自视高明，应该做一个恭恭敬敬的小学生。于是，我们主动请活学活用毛主席著作的先进人物介绍经验；深入车间班组，听无产阶级革命派揭发、控诉党内一小撮走资派的滔天罪行；深入宿舍，听苦大仇深的老工人忆苦思甜。通过这些活动，我们深刻地体会到无产阶级革命派最热爱毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想。他们的深厚阶级感情和鲜明的阶级立场，使我们进一步坚定了左派的立场，增强了左派的感情，一个心眼爱左派，一个心眼支持左派。
    我们甘当革命群众的小学生，不仅从思想上向群众学习，支左工作有了问题，也向群众请教。红卫区工厂、机关、学校很多，而我们第一批进驻的工厂还不到全区工厂的十分之一。在这种情况下，怎样尽快地把毛泽东思想传播到各单位呢？我们遵照毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，带着这个问题和革命群众一起商量。正在毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命群众组织负责人，提出了组织工人业余毛泽东思想宣传网的建议，他们说：我们不仅要在学习班里互相帮助，回厂以后，厂与厂之间也要继续搞“一帮一”、“一对红”。我们及时采纳了群众的意见，并且和他们一起，搞“一帮一”、“一对红”，做到一厂做得好，各厂都来学，一厂有问题，各厂共同帮。这样群策群力，促进了全区的革命大联合和革命的“三结合”。我们还建立了定期听取群众意见，定期向群众检查的制度，自觉地把自己置于群众监督之下，以改进支左工作。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？在新的一年里，我们要以毛主席最新指示为纲，和广大无产阶级革命派一起，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
