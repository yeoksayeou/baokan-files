One night, under a pitch-black sky, the road to the military camp was deserted. There were no pedestrians, only soldiers Liu Yuhang and Zhou Zhengguang pedaling their bicycles. Along the way, they discussed the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, eager to help the production brigade's two revolutionary mass organizations unite.

Soon, they reached a sharp turn. The left side of the road was a steep cliff, and the right side was a deep ravine. At that moment, a jeep roared towards them at full speed. The driver saw two soldiers on bicycles ahead and quickly turned the car to the right. The car's bright headlights blinded Liu and Zhou, making it impossible for them to see the direction of the oncoming vehicle. They turned their bicycles to the left, directly heading towards the car. The distance between them narrowed rapidly: ten meters, eight meters, five meters...

The driver slammed on the brakes, but the car continued to skid forward. Turning left was no longer an option, and turning right meant plunging into the ravine. What to do? In this critical moment, the driver's mind flashed with Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." He thought: The PLA works tirelessly, spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses, and in the "three supports, two militaries," they have made immortal contributions to the Cultural Revolution. I am a revolutionary rebel worker. I must learn from the PLA comrades. To protect the PLA, even if it means sacrificing myself, I will not let the car hit the soldiers. With that, he forcefully turned the steering wheel, making a sharp turn to the right. In an instant, the car plunged into the ravine and crashed into a tree, coming to a halt. Liu and Zhou were saved, but the driver was seriously injured in the head and was sent to the hospital. It was later discovered that the driver was Zhao Dezhen, a "five-good" driver from a certain mine and an old Communist Party member, a brave warrior who fearlessly fought against the capitalist roaders within the Party.

The unit's leaders and Liu and Zhou, with hearts full of gratitude, brought red copies of Chairman Mao's works to the hospital to visit. Seeing the rescued soldiers, driver Zhao was overjoyed. Liu and Zhou shouted in unison: "Learn from the revolutionary rebels! Salute the revolutionary rebels! Learn from Comrade Zhao!" Everyone enthusiastically praised his heroic deed, but Zhao said:

"I did what I should have done according to Chairman Mao's teachings on 'supporting the army and loving the people.' I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the PLA comrades, and vow to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." Soon, Zhao recovered and returned to his post.

The story of the revolutionary faction protecting the PLA spread throughout the unit. All cadres and soldiers unanimously declared: We must more actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new wave of loving the people, and do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work. The broad revolutionary masses also decided to take Comrade Zhao Dezhen as an example, launch a larger-scale movement to support the army, strive to be models in supporting the army, and with practical actions, defend the iron Great Wall of the proletariat and safeguard the Cultural Revolution.

    用鲜血和生命保护解放军
    一天深夜，天黑沉沉的。通往军营的公路上，没有一个行人，只有战士刘玉航和周正光骑着自行车奔驰。一路上，他俩畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，想尽快地帮助生产队两大革命群众组织联合起来。
    不一会，他俩来到了一个急转弯处。路的左侧是陡峭的崖壁，右侧是深沟。这时，一辆开足马力的吉普车迎面飞驰而来。汽车司机发现前面有两个骑自行车的解放军战士，急忙把汽车向右拐，汽车的强烈灯光却把小刘和小周的眼睛照花了，他们看不清汽车来的方向，便将自行车向左拐，正好自行车和汽车对头开。距离越来越近了，十米，八米，五米……司机紧急刹车，可是车轮还是继续向前冲。向左拐来不及了，向右拐，是一条深沟。怎么办？在这急紧关头，司机同志的头脑里立即展现出毛主席的伟大教导：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”他想：解放军起早贪黑，为广大革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，在“三支”“两军”中，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。我是一个革命造反派工人，我要向解放军同志学习。为了保护解放军，就是牺牲了自己，也决不让车子撞在解放军战士的身上。于是，他使劲地扳动方向盘，来了个向右急转弯，刹那间，车子冲进了深沟，碰在一棵树上，车子停下来了。小刘和小周脱险了，可是司机同志头部负了重伤，送进了医院。后来才知道这个司机是某矿的五好司机、老共产党员赵德真，是一位向党内走资派勇猛冲杀的勇敢战士。
    部队首长和小刘、小周怀着无限感激的心情，带着红彤彤的毛主席宝书，来到医院问候。司机老赵见到脱险的解放军战士后，十分高兴。小刘和小周异口同声地高呼：“向革命造反派学习，向革命造反派致敬！向老赵同志学习！”大家都热忱地称颂他的英雄事迹，可是老赵却说：
  “我是按照毛主席‘拥军爱民’的教导，做了我应做的事。我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，向解放军同志学习，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”不久，老赵伤好出院，回到了战斗岗位。
    革命派保护解放军的事迹传到部队，广大干部和战士一致表示：要更加积极宣传毛泽东思想，掀起爱民新高潮，搞好“三支”“两军”工作。广大革命群众也决心以赵德真同志为榜样，掀起更大规模的拥军运动，争做拥军的模范，以实际行动捍卫无产阶级的钢铁长城，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
