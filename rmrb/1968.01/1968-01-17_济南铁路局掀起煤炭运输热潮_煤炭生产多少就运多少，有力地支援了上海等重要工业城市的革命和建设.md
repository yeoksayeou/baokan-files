Jinan Railway Bureau Launches Coal Transportation Campaign

Coal production is transported as much as it is produced, strongly supporting the revolution and construction of important industrial cities such as Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 16 - The revolutionary workers of the Jinan Railway Bureau, at the beginning of the brilliant year 1968, implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They launched a transportation campaign centered on coal. In the first decade of January, the total cargo volume increased by 9% compared to December last year, with coal transportation increasing by an average of 36%. They achieved the goal of transporting as much coal as is produced, effectively promoting coal production and strongly supporting the revolution and socialist construction of important industrial cities such as Shanghai.

The revolutionary masses of the Jinan Railway Bureau followed Chairman Mao's teachings, achieved revolutionary unity at the end of last year, and established a unified revolutionary mass organization throughout the bureau. At the beginning of 1968, they held a full-line broadcast meeting to mobilize and organize revolutionary workers to deeply study the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. Based on a review and summary of last year's work, they implemented and fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Revolutionary workers, in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war," unanimously recognized that further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fighting against selfishness, and criticizing revisionism to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking is the key to completing railway transportation tasks. Now, various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are emerging in large numbers in this bureau, and the revolutionary criticism is flourishing throughout the bureau, with a good situation in both revolution and production.

In completing the heavy transportation work centered on coal, the Jinan Railway Bureau took effective measures to quickly unload cars and promptly send empty cars to the coal mines. Since this year, the phenomenon of coal production being affected by railway transportation has been eliminated. At all levels, dispatchers have used their brains in organizing loading work, greatly improving the utilization rate of vehicles. Various railway sub-bureaus and stations have displayed a spirit of great communist cooperation, breaking through bureau and station boundaries, cooperating and supporting each other, and doing everything possible to ensure the empty cars needed for the transportation of coal and other key materials.

Revolutionary locomotive workers have also made great contributions in the current transportation of coal and other key materials. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, breaking many old regulations and frameworks that constrained productivity, and opening up a broad path for achieving more and faster transportation. The railway line between Jinan and Tai'an has a steep slope. In the past, trains exceeding 2,000 tons required two locomotives to pull. Since this year, the revolutionary workers of the Jinan Locomotive Section have broken through superstitions, formed a "three-in-one" team of workers, technicians, and administrative personnel, and conducted five experiments. The result was that one locomotive pulled 2,500 to 2,700 tons, creating the highest record of single-locomotive pulling in this section.

    济南铁路局掀起煤炭运输热潮
    煤炭生产多少就运多少，有力地支援了上海等重要工业城市的革命和建设
    新华社济南十六日电　济南铁路局广大革命职工在光辉灿烂的一九六八年一开始，贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在全局掀起了一个以运输煤炭为中心的运输热潮。一月上旬货运总量比去年十二月平均提高了百分之九，其中煤炭的运输量平均提高了百分之三十六，做到了煤矿生产多少就运多少，有力地促进了煤炭生产，有力地支援了上海等重要工业城市的革命和社会主义建设。
    济南铁路局的广大革命群众遵循毛主席的教导，在去年年底就实现了革命大联合，全局成立了统一的革命群众组织。一九六八年刚开始，他们召开了全路局有线广播大会，动员、组织广大革命职工深入学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论，在检查总结去年工作的基础上，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。广大革命职工在落实毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的指示的过程中，一致认识到，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，狠斗私字，猛批修正主义，促进人的思想革命化，这是完成铁路运输任务的关键。现在，各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班正在这个局大量涌现，革命的大批判在全局蓬勃展开，革命和生产的形势一片大好。
    在完成以煤炭为中心的繁重的运输工作中，济南铁路局采取了有力的措施，尽快卸车，及时把空车送到煤矿。今年以来，因铁路运输而影响煤炭生产的现象已经没有了。各级调度人员在装车组织工作上开动脑筋，大大提高了车辆的使用率。各铁路分局和车站之间发扬共产主义大协作精神，打破局界和站界，互相配合，互相支援，千方百计地保证运输煤炭等重点物资所需要的空车。
    广大革命机务人员在当前煤炭等重点物资的运输工作中，也做出了很大贡献。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，破除了不少束缚生产力的旧规章、老框框，为实现多拉快跑开辟了广阔的道路。济南和泰安间的铁路线因为坡度大，过去超过两千吨的列车，就用两个火车头牵引。今年以来，济南机务段的革命职工破除迷信思想，组成工人、技术员和行政人员“三结合”的班子，进行五次试验，结果一个火车头牵引了二千五百吨到二千七百吨，创造了这个区间单机牵引的最高纪录。
