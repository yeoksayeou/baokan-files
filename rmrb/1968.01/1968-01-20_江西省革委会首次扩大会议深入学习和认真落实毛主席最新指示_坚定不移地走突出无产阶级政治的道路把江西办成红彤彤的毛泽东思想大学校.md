The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held its first enlarged meeting from January 6 to 18. This meeting, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and conducted a thorough study, application, implementation, and propagation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This meeting served as a rallying call for the 22 million people of Jinggangshan to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was also a rallying call for the 22 million people of Jinggangshan to firmly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics and turn Jiangxi into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Participants in the enlarged meeting, including all members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, leaders of various levels of temporary power organs, leaders of support-left troops, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations from various places, expressed their deep class feelings of boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao. They actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, recalling past victories in struggle, and said with great enthusiasm, "Following the great leader Chairman Mao is happiness, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is victory. The people of Jinggangshan will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, from victory to victory!" They shouted a thousand times, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

At the enlarged meeting, comrades unanimously declared that the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely emphasize proletarian politics, and place ideological and political work in the first position. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee must become the command center for ideological and political work for the people of the entire province, and its members must become ideological and political workers and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, there are countless tasks, but the key is to emphasize proletarian politics. Whether or not to emphasize proletarian politics is a major issue concerning the fate of the country, the party, and the regime, and whether the people gain everything or lose everything. One must firmly believe in and resolutely implement proletarian politics. At all times, ideological and political work must be placed in the foremost position, not the second or third, and certainly not on an equal footing with other work. By emphasizing proletarian politics and strengthening ideological and political work, by arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, everything will be smooth, and all problems will be solved, leading to victory.

Participants in the meeting believed that emphasizing proletarian politics is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. It is to lead with Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily, everyone deeply understood that at present, seriously studying, deeply understanding, fully implementing, and resolutely executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest emphasis on politics. Chairman Mao's latest instructions represent the most fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. Acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions gives people a soul, sets standards for work, provides direction for progress, and strengthens the struggle, ensuring victory in all battles. Acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions is to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to be infinitely loyal and devoted to Chairman Mao. In the new year, every region, every front, every unit, and every revolutionary mass in the province must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in every aspect, striving to be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Participants in the meeting, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summarized achievements, exchanged experiences, and identified weak links. They said that the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the most important and fundamental experience. The greatest weak link is that in some regions and units, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have not been fully implemented. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must be loyal, diligently apply them, break down selfishness, and establish public-mindedness. One must wage a "people's war" to overthrow factionalism. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism are extremely reactionary and are a vicious enemy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If factionalism is not overthrown, Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be implemented, proletarian party spirit cannot be established, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment will be disrupted. Immediately, fully mobilize the masses to wage a "people's war" against factionalism, expose its crimes, and uproot its poisonous roots, making factionalism stink and leaving it no place to hide.

Participants in the meeting pointed out, based on their personal experiences, that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Class enemies will never willingly perish. We must maintain high revolutionary vigilance, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, resolutely expose the evil plots of class enemies, and smash all their sabotage activities, ensuring the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All participants in the meeting acted while discussing, promoting each other inside and outside the meeting, and driving the entire province to launch a high tide of seriously studying and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

After repeated discussions, the meeting unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Taking Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions as the Guideline to Further Widen and Deepen the Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought," calling on the military and people of the entire province to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and swiftly launch a more widespread and deeper mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the province, turning Jiangxi into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The resolution first proposed that fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the center of all our work, the key to the key, and the first priority. All regions and units in the province must immediately launch a mass movement of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, acting swiftly and decisively, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are directly implemented among the broad masses of the people. With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes must be organized, and the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao of combining theory with practice must be established. The resolution also proposed to seriously study the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army, implementing the entire set of political work systems of the army in various units, adhering to the Four Firsts, promoting the Three-Eight Style, and carrying out "One Helps One" and "One Red Pair" activities to promote the ideological revolutionization of the people.

The meeting also formulated the "Several Regulations on Achieving the Revolutionization of Organs," requiring all staff of the Revolutionary Committee to firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and transform oneself, achieve the ideological revolutionization of the people, and the revolutionization of work style and leadership methods, building the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee into an extremely revolutionary and combat-ready proletarian power organ. All work of the Revolutionary Committee must emphasize proletarian politics and take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest criterion. The Revolutionary Committee must seriously implement the principle of democratic centralism, adhere to the leadership method of the mass line, establish a swift and decisive work style, and promote a simple and frugal lifestyle.

On the first day of the meeting, all participants had a revolutionary traditional meal, which was the red rice and pumpkin that the great leader Chairman Mao ate when he established the revolutionary base in Jinggangshan. Everyone was moved and expressed their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever read Chairman Mao's books, forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, carry forward the glorious traditions of the old revolutionary base, firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and march forward bravely, turning Jiangxi into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

    江西省革委会首次扩大会议深入学习和认真落实毛主席最新指示
    坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路把江西办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    据新华社南昌十九日电　江西省革命委员会在一月六日到十八日举行了第一次扩大会议。这次会议高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，对毛主席的最新指示进行了一次大学习、大运用、大落实、大贯彻。这次会议，是推动全省二千二百万井冈山儿女全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的誓师大会；是推动全省二千二百万井冈山儿女坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治之路，把江西办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的誓师大会。
    参加扩大会议的省革委会全体委员、各级临时权力机构的领导同志、支左部队的领导同志、各地革命群众组织负责人和代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的深厚阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，回忆过去胜利的斗争历程，满怀激情地说：“紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是幸福，落实毛主席的最新指示就是胜利。井冈山儿女永远跟着毛主席闹革命，从胜利走向胜利！”同志们千百次地尽情欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大统帅毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在扩大会议上，同志们一致表示，江西省革命委员会一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决突出无产阶级政治，把思想政治工作摆在第一位。省革命委员会必须成为全省人民的思想政治工作指挥部，省革命委员会的成员必须成为思想政治工作人员和毛泽东思想宣传员。革命委员会成立后，事情千头万绪，要抓根本，根本就是突出无产阶级政治。突出不突出无产阶级政治，是关系到国家的存亡、党的存亡、政权的存亡的大问题，是人民得到一切或丧失一切的大问题。对突出无产阶级政治，思想上要坚信不疑，行动上要坚定不移。任何时候，都要把思想政治工作摆在一切工作的头一位，不能摆在第二位、第三位，更不能摆在和其他工作同等的地位。突出了无产阶级政治，抓好了思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想武装了人的头脑，就会一通百通，一动百动，一切问题都会迎刃而解，就会迎来胜利。
    参加会议的同志认为，突出无产阶级政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，就是以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。大家通过学习毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，深刻认识到，在当前，认真学习、深刻领会、全面落实、坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，就是最大的突出政治。毛主席的最新指示代表了无产阶级和广大人民群众的最根本的利益。按照毛主席的最新指示办事，人就有灵魂，工作就有标准，前进就有方向，战斗就有力量，就能百战百胜。按照毛主席的最新指示办事，就是坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚。在新的一年里，全省每一个地区，每一条战线，每一个单位，每一个革命群众，对毛主席的最新指示都要条条照办，处处照办，争当学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功。
    参加会议的同志以毛主席的最新指示为纲，总结了成绩，交流了经验，寻找了薄弱环节。大家说，无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利，就是执行毛主席最新指示的成果。照毛主席的最新指示办事，就是最重要、最根本的经验。最大的薄弱环节，就是在某些地区、某些单位，毛主席的最新指示还没有全面落实。要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就要心怀一个忠字，狠抓一个用字，大破一个私字，大立一个公字，就要打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性具有极大的反动性，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个凶恶敌人。派性不打倒，毛主席的最新指示就落实不了，无产阶级党性就树立不了，毛主席的伟大战略部署就要受到干扰。要立即充分发动群众，打一场打倒派性的“人民战争”，大摆派性的罪状，大挖派性的毒根，把派性搞得臭臭的，使它没有藏身之地。
    参加会议的同志根据自己的切身体验指出，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。阶级敌人是决不会甘心灭亡的。我们要保持高度的革命警惕性，切实加强无产阶级专政，坚决揭露阶级敌人的恶毒阴谋，坚决粉碎他们的一切破坏活动，保证毛主席的最新指示全面落实，保证无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。
    参加会议的全体同志一边开会，一边行动，会内会外，互相促进，推动全省掀起了一个认真学习、全面落实毛主席最新指示的高潮。
    经过反复讨论，会议一致通过了“关于以毛主席最新指示为纲，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动的决议”，号召全省军民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在全省范围内迅速掀起一个更加广泛、更加深入的活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，把江西省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    决议首先提出，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利最根本的保证，是我们一切工作中心的中心，关键的关键，首要的首要，全省各地区各单位要立即开展一个对毛主席最新指示的大学习、大宣传、大落实的群众运动，要闻风而动，雷厉风行，一杆子插到底，让毛主席最新指示最直接地落实到广大人民群众中去。要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，树立毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。决议还提出，要认真学习人民解放军的政治工作经验，把解放军一整套政治工作制度推行到各单位中去，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展“一帮一”、“一对红”的活动，促进人的思想革命化。
    大会还制订了“关于实现机关革命化的几项规定”，要求革命委员会全体工作人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，实现人的思想革命化，实现工作作风、领导方法革命化，把江西省革命委员会建设成为非常革命化、非常战斗化的无产阶级权力机构。要求革命委员会的一切工作，都必须突出无产阶级政治，以毛泽东思想为最高准则。革命委员会要认真贯彻民主集中制的原则，坚持群众路线的领导方法，树立雷厉风行的工作作风，发扬艰苦朴素的生活作风。
    会议的第一天，全体同志吃了一餐革命传统饭，就是伟大领袖毛主席当年在井冈山创建革命根据地时吃的红米南瓜饭。大家激动地表示，一定永远忠于毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，永远听毛主席的话，永远紧跟毛主席干革命，发扬革命老根据地的光荣传统，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进，把江西办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。（附图片）
