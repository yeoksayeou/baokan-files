In the face of the fierce storm of revolution in Asia, the British Empire, mired in a comprehensive political and economic crisis, has finally been forced to announce the premature withdrawal of its colonial troops from Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the closure of its military bases in those regions. This marks the complete failure of the British rulers' "East of Suez" military policy, which was aimed at following the U.S. imperialists in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia. This is another fatal blow to British imperialism, which has suffered from the devaluation of the pound in less than two months, and is another important sign of the accelerating decline of the British colonial empire.

The decision for the British colonial troops to withdraw prematurely from the "East of Suez" region was announced by Prime Minister Harold Wilson of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. From the 16th to the 18th, the House of Commons held meetings in a tense and depressed atmosphere to listen to Wilson's "cost-cutting" plan, which included the withdrawal of troops, and to engage in heated debates on this plan and Britain's disastrous financial and economic situation.

Wilson announced that Britain would withdraw its troops from Malaya (including Singapore) by the end of 1971, which is much earlier than the mid-1970s withdrawal announced in July of the previous year; the British troops stationed in the Persian Gulf would also withdraw simultaneously. Once the British troops have withdrawn, Britain's aircraft carriers will be "immediately decommissioned." At the same time, according to Wilson's announcement, Britain will also accelerate the reduction of approximately 80,000 troops and cancel the order for the purchase of 50 F-111 aircraft from the United States.

The Labour Party government's adoption of these measures is entirely out of necessity. After coming to power in 1964, the Labour Party government vigorously pursued the notorious "East of Suez" military policy, maintaining and establishing military bases in strategic locations from the Middle East to the Far East, stationing large numbers of land, sea, and air forces to act as executioners in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, in order to cooperate with the U.S. aggression against Asian countries, especially the aggression against Vietnam, and to maintain Britain's own colonial interests in the region. However, this policy has further plunged British imperialism, along with U.S. imperialism, into the vast sea of anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, thereby greatly accelerating the political and economic crisis of the collapsing British colonial empire. Under these circumstances, the Wilson government was forced to announce in July of last year that it would withdraw its colonial troops from Malaya (including Singapore) on a scheduled basis and prepare to "adjust" Britain's entire military strength and military deployments. However, the power of the armed struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, as well as the urgent financial and economic situation marked by the devaluation of the pound, finally forced the Wilson government to withdraw its colonial troops from South Yemen in advance in November of last year, and now it has to announce the complete collapse of the "East of Suez" military policy.

Of course, British imperialism is neither willing to withdraw from this vast and strategically important region nor will it stop being an enemy of the revolutionary peoples of Asia. Wilson has already clearly stated that British troops will continue to be stationed in Hong Kong, and in the future, it is possible that troops will be dispatched from Western European bases or from the British mainland to suppress the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asian countries. However, the complete failure of the "East of Suez" policy still shows that this old colonial empire has become a spent force, having fallen from its former status as the so-called "empire on which the sun never sets" to a mere island nation in Europe, and is completely unable to maintain the facade of a "world power." On the 16th, when Wilson announced the "cost-cutting" plan, he had to admit in a depressed manner: "We do not have the ability to do everything we want to do," and must re-evaluate Britain's "role in the world" and realistically adjust its obligations according to its actual capabilities.

It is worth noting that the collapse of the "East of Suez" policy is not only an important sign of the sunset of the British colonial empire but also a very heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy, especially their aggressive deployments in Asia. At present, the U.S. aggressors, who have been beaten to a standstill by the heroic Vietnamese people, are desperately struggling to avoid the fate of annihilation, while at the same time, the U.S. is intensifying its plots against the revolutionary peoples of the Middle East. It is precisely at this time that Britain is withdrawing its troops from the Far East and the Middle East in advance, which makes the U.S. politically and militarily even more isolated in the vast region from Southeast Asia to the Persian Gulf. In addition, Britain's decision to cancel the order for a large number of military aircraft from the United States has also dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. rulers, who are anxious about their huge international trade deficit, because this will result in the loss of a significant source of income. Therefore, before the Labour Party government made its final decision, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk both exerted tremendous pressure on Wilson and British Foreign Secretary George Brown, urging Britain to keep its troops in the "East of Suez" region and not to cancel the order for aircraft from the United States. After Wilson announced the Labour Party government's decision in the House of Commons, the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense immediately expressed "regret."

The collapse of the "East of Suez" policy will also promote the further disintegration of the Commonwealth system. On the one hand, the revolutionary peoples of some countries and regions will rise up to further develop their struggles against British imperialism and local reactionary rule; on the other hand, some Commonwealth members, such as the Singapore government, Australia, and New Zealand, have strongly opposed the British troops' premature withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Their relations with Britain will become increasingly distant.

Western newspapers are discussing that after being forced to make the decision to withdraw prematurely from "East of Suez," Britain will concentrate its efforts on trying to enter the European continent, seeking a political and economic way out. However, it will encounter the obstacle of France. One wants to enter, and the other is determined not to let it in, which will inevitably lead to the intensification of contradictions between Western European countries, especially between Britain and France.

At the same time as announcing the relevant measures for the withdrawal of troops, Wilson also announced a series of measures that openly target the broad masses of the British people, further shifting the financial and economic difficulties onto the people.

The great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will undoubtedly deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world." In the context of the flourishing revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, the accelerating decline of British imperialism fully confirms Chairman Mao's profound judgment.

    亚非人民反帝斗争风起云涌　帝国主义殖民统治日薄西山
    英国被迫宣布提前从远东中东撤军
    英帝“苏伊士以东”殖民军事政策彻底破产　美国反革命全球战略遭沉重打击
    据新华社伦敦十八日电　本社记者报道：在亚洲人民革命风暴的猛烈冲击下，深陷在政治、经济总危机之中的英帝国主义，终于被迫宣布提前撤走它在东南亚和中东地区的殖民军并且关闭在那里的军事基地，这就宣告了英国统治者追随美帝国主义镇压亚洲各国人民革命斗争的“苏伊士以东”军事政策彻底破产。这是英镑贬值后不到两个月中英帝国主义遭到的又一次致命打击，是英殖民帝国加速衰亡的又一个重要标志。
    英国殖民军不得不从“苏伊士以东”地区提前滚蛋的决定，是工党政府首相威尔逊十六日在议会下院宣布的。下院从十六日到十八日在危急而沮丧的气氛中开会，听取威尔逊提出的包括撤军在内的“削减开支”计划，并且就这个计划以及英国灾难性的财政、经济情况进行了激烈的争吵。
    威尔逊宣布，英国将在一九七一年年底以前从马来亚（包括新加坡）撤出驻军，这就比去年七月间所宣布的七十年代中叶撤出的时间大大提前；驻波斯湾的英军也要同时撤出。英军一旦撤退完毕，英国的航空母舰就要“立即退役”。同时，据威尔逊宣布，英国还要加快裁减约八万兵员，并且取消向美国购买五十架F—111飞机的订货。
    英国工党政府采取这些措施完全是迫不得已的。工党政府在一九六四年上台后，大力推行臭名远扬的“苏伊士以东”军事政策，在从中东到远东地区的战略要地保持和建立军事基地，驻扎大批陆、海、空军，充当镇压亚洲人民革命斗争的刽子手，以配合美国侵略亚洲国家，特别是侵略越南的战略部署，并且维护英国自己在这个地区的殖民利益。但是，这个政策使得英帝国主义同美帝国主义一起进一步陷入了亚洲人民反帝斗争的汪洋大海之中，从而大大促使崩溃中的英殖民帝国的政治、经济危机急剧恶化。在这种情况下，威尔逊政府去年七月不得不宣布定期从马来亚（包括新加坡）撤出殖民军，并且准备对英国整个军事力量和军事部署进行“调整”。但是，东南亚和中东各国人民武装斗争的威力以及以英镑贬值为标志的英国财政、经济情况的危急，终于迫使威尔逊政府在去年十一月不得不提前撤走驻南也门的殖民军，现在又不得不宣告“苏伊士以东”军事政策整个垮台。
    当然，英帝国主义既不甘心退出富饶而具有战略重要性的这个广大地区，也不会就此停止与亚洲革命人民为敌。威尔逊已经明白表示，英军将继续留驻香港，而且今后还可能从西欧基地或英国本土派出军队去镇压亚洲国家人民的革命运动。但是，“苏伊士以东”政策的彻底破产仍然表明：英国这个老牌的殖民帝国已成强弩之末，它已经从昔日的所谓“太阳不落的国度”沦落为欧洲的区区岛国，根本无法支撑“世界大国”的门面了。威尔逊在十六日宣布“削减开支”计划时不得不沮丧地承认：“我们没有能力去做我们愿意做的一切事情”，必须重新估计英国“在世界上的作用，并且根据我们的实际能力现实地调整我们的义务”。
    值得注意的是：“苏伊士以东”政策的垮台，不仅是英殖民帝国日落西山的重要标志，而且是对美帝国主义的反革命全球战略，特别是对它在亚洲的侵略部署的一个十分沉重的打击。目前，被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额的美国侵略者为免遭覆灭的厄运，正在疯狂地进行垂死挣扎，同时，美国在中东也正在加紧策划反对当地革命人民的阴谋。恰恰在这样的时候，英国要从远东和中东提前撤退驻军，这就使得美国在从东南亚到波斯湾的广大地区里在政治上和军事上更加孤立。此外，英国取消向美国订购大批军用飞机的决定，也给了正为庞大的国际收支赤字而焦急的美国统治者当头一棒，因为这会使美国丧失一笔收入。因此，在工党政府作出最后决定前，美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克都向威尔逊和英国外交大臣布朗施加强大压力，要英国既把军队留在“苏伊士以东”地区，也不取消向美国购买飞机的订单。当威尔逊在下院宣布了工党政府的决定之后，美国国务院和国防部都马上表示“遗憾”。
      “苏伊士以东”政策的垮台，还将促进英联邦体系的进一步瓦解。一方面，某些国家和地区的革命人民将奋起进一步开展反对英帝国主义和当地反动统治的斗争；另一方面，一些联邦成员，如新加坡当局、澳大利亚和新西兰政府已对英军的提前撤出东南亚表示强烈不满。它们同英国的关系将日益疏远。
    西方报纸纷纷谈论，英国在被迫作出提前从“苏伊士以东”撤退的决定后，将集中精力设法挤入西欧大陆，以寻求一条政治上和经济上的出路。但是，它将碰到法国这个巨大的障碍。一个要进去，一个坚决不让进，这就必然会引起西欧国家之间，特别是英、法两国之间矛盾的激化。
    威尔逊在宣布有关撤军等措施的同时，还宣布了明目张胆地向英国广大人民开刀的一系列措施，进一步向人民转嫁财政经济困难。
    中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。”在世界人民革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，英帝国主义的加速走向坟墓，完全证实了毛主席的这一英明论断。
