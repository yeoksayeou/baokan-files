The power of people's war is boundless, daring to struggle achieves glory. Over the past seven years, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have annihilated and disintegrated nearly 1.5 million enemy troops.

	Hanoi, January 1, 1968 (Xinhua) — The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam recently issued a communiqué stating that under the glorious banner of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have achieved and are achieving great victories on various fronts of the anti-American, national salvation war. According to incomplete statistics, by December 13, 1967, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population had annihilated and disintegrated nearly 1.5 million enemy troops (including more than 300,000 American aggressors and mercenary troops; completely annihilated 181 enemy battalions and 982 companies); shot down or destroyed 8,590 enemy aircraft; destroyed 15,835 enemy vehicles; sunk 463 enemy ships; captured 2,704 large and small enemy strongholds and outposts; and destroyed 1,302 bridges.

	The communiqué first reviewed the seven-year struggle of the South Vietnamese people since the establishment of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front.

	The communiqué pointed out that the birth of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is a turning point in the anti-American, national salvation war of the South Vietnamese people following the anti-French war. Its birth quickly and firmly pushed the anti-American, national salvation war forward.

	The communiqué pointed out that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people, following the invincible people's war line of the National Liberation Front, have grown in all aspects. Guerrilla warfare in the mountains, plains, and coastal areas has become increasingly widespread. The South Vietnamese military and civilian population, based on a high level of political awareness, with patriotic fervor and deep hatred for the American aggressors and their lackey, the Vietnamese puppet regime, have overcome various hardships and difficulties, determined to attack and continuously attack the enemy, achieving one great victory after another.

	The communiqué said that the South Vietnamese military and civilian population have successively foiled the enemy's various "new tactics," defeating the enemy's so-called "elite" troops, shattering the arrogant plans of the American war hawks, and making their "special war" and "limited war" strategies fail.

	The communiqué pointed out that while the liberation armed forces have been rapidly growing, the South Vietnamese people have also formed a political struggle army of over 200 million people. Over the past seven years, the number of people participating in various political struggles has reached 1.2 billion. The cities temporarily occupied by the enemy have become volcanoes burning under the feet of the American aggressors and their lackeys.

	The communiqué pointed out that in South Vietnam, a vast liberated area covering four-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population has been established. The people here have realized their right to self-governance. Despite the enemy's frenzied "sweeping" and bombing, the people in the liberated areas continue to produce and fight.

	The communiqué then focused on the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilian population in their fierce struggle against the American aggressors in 1966 and 1967.

	The communiqué said that in July 1965, when the "special war" failed and the puppet army and puppet government were rapidly collapsing, the United States hastily dispatched a large number of troops to South Vietnam to wage a "limited war." The American aggressors attempted to use their powerful military potential and all barbaric means to force the South Vietnamese people to surrender.

	The communiqué pointed out that for the South Vietnamese people, fighting against a large number of American aggressors equipped with modern weapons was an unprecedented event. The South Vietnamese military and civilian population, while fighting, have summarized their experiences and have initially drawn an important conclusion: the South Vietnamese military and civilian population can use their own combat methods to annihilate American military units, whether they are infantry or mechanized troops. In the winter and spring of 1965-1966, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population successfully foiled the first "dry season counteroffensive" of American imperialism, annihilating 110,000 enemy troops (including more than 40,000 American and mercenary troops), completely annihilating 30 enemy battalions (including 14 American and mercenary infantry battalions). Entering the winter and spring of 1966-1967, the American aggressors increased the total number of American troops to 400,000, making the total number of American and puppet troops exceed 1 million. At the same time, they doubled the number of armored vehicles, artillery, and fighter jets. They proposed a "pincher" strategic plan of "search and destroy" and "pacification," attempting to achieve a decisive victory. However, the enemy's "second dry season counteroffensive" also suffered a crushing defeat. During this period, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population annihilated 175,000 enemy troops (including 70,000 American troops), making 49 battalions and equivalent units lose their combat effectiveness (including 28 American battalions), and destroying thousands of aircraft and hundreds of artillery pieces.

	Thus, in the two years of direct confrontation with American imperialism (up to December 13, 1967), according to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population have annihilated and disintegrated nearly 800,000 enemy troops (including nearly 300,000 American and mercenary troops, annihilating 120 American and puppet military units and 684 companies); shot down and destroyed 5,330 enemy aircraft; destroyed 11,800 vehicles, and sunk 297 ships. During this period, nearly 150,000 puppet soldiers deserted.

	The communiqué said that while achieving great military victories, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population have also achieved tremendous political victories. In the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, the movement opposing the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitorous clique and demanding the withdrawal of American and mercenary troops from South Vietnam has flourished. The internal contradictions of the puppet government have become extremely sharp, and the traitorous face of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique has been fully exposed. Since the beginning of 1967, the American and puppet clique has adopted deceptive means such as the puppet "constitution" and puppet elections to try to cover up the puppet government. However, their deceitful "election" farce has been resisted by the broad masses in the enemy-occupied areas, and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique has fallen into unprecedented isolation.

	The communiqué pointed out that the international prestige of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is increasingly high. The just struggle of the South Vietnamese people has won the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people around the world. The political program of the National Liberation Front has been warmly welcomed and supported by many countries and peoples of the world. The movement against American aggression in Vietnam is surging in various places.

	The communiqué pointed out that from the establishment of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to the present, the following conclusions can be drawn:

	1. The path that the South Vietnamese people have taken and are taking is completely correct. The correct struggle line of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front has united all the South Vietnamese people in the ranks of the anti-American, national salvation struggle, and the spirit of revolutionary heroism and all potential have been highly developed, making the enemy more isolated than ever, making the puppet government disintegrate, and making the puppet army rapidly disintegrate.

	2. The South Vietnamese people have found a way to victory in the struggle against an enemy that is both brutal and has strong military power. The South Vietnamese people, through actual struggle, have created many new combat methods under the conditions of "limited war," mastered the key to seizing the initiative on the battlefield, and laid the foundation for achieving greater victories in the future.

	3. The more American imperialism strengthens its aggression, the more it suffers shameful defeats. The more it increases its troops in the South, the more its casualties increase exponentially. When the total number of American troops is 400,000, its annual casualties account for about one-fourth of the total, but when the total number of American troops reaches 470,000, its casualties in one year reach one-third of the total. Even if American troops increase further, the South Vietnamese military and civilian population are determined to defeat and will definitely defeat them.

	4. The current situation of the struggle of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population is very favorable. The glorious victories in the initial months of the 1967-1968 winter and spring have provided more favorable conditions for the anti-American, national salvation struggle of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population. The South Vietnamese military and civilian population are firmly seizing the initiative on the battlefield.

	The communiqué finally emphasized that although the situation is very favorable, the South Vietnamese people understand that the future battles will be extremely fierce. The stubborn American imperialist aggressors will not accept defeat. The South Vietnamese military and civilian population must advance, strike the enemy more fiercely, continuously, and extensively, and resolutely seize greater and more comprehensive victories. Under the glorious banner of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, no obstacles can stop the determined advance of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population.

    人民战争威力无穷  敢于斗争屡建功勋
    越南南方军民七年来消灭和瓦解敌军一百五十万
    新华社河内一日电　越南南方解放通讯社在最近发表的一项公报中说，越南南方军民，在越南南方民族解放阵线光荣旗帜的指引下，七年来，在抗美救国战争的各个不同的战线上，已经和正在取得巨大的胜利。据不完全统计，截至一九六七年十二月十三日为止，南方军民已经消灭和瓦解敌军近一百五十万名（其中美国侵略军和帮凶军三十多万名；全歼美伪军一百八十一个营和九百八十二个连）；击落、击毁敌机八千五百九十架；击毁敌人的军车一万五千八百三十五辆；击沉敌船艇四百六十三艘；攻克敌人的大小据点和哨所二千七百零四个；破坏桥梁一千三百零二座。
    公报首先回顾了越南南方民族解放阵线成立七年来南方人民走过的战斗历程。
    公报指出，越南南方民族解放阵线的诞生，是越南南方人民继抗法战争之后进行的抗美救国战争的一个转折点，它的诞生，迅速和坚强地把抗美救国战争推向前进。
    公报指出，南方人民解放武装力量遵循着民族解放阵线的无敌的人民战争路线，在各方面得到不断的成长，山区、平原和沿海的游击战争日益广泛地发展。南方军民在具有高度的政治觉悟的基础上，怀着爱国的热忱和对美国侵略者及其走狗越奸集团的刻骨仇恨，克服了种种艰难困苦，决心进攻和连续进攻敌人，取得了一个又一个的巨大胜利。
    公报说，南方军民先后挫败了敌人的种种“新战术”，把美伪军的各种“精锐”部队打得落花流水，粉碎了美国好战集团的一切狂妄计划，使它们的“特种战争”和“局部战争”战略遭到了破产。
    公报指出，在解放武装力量飞跃成长的同时，南方人民还组成了一支包括二百多万人的政治斗争大军。七年来，参加各次政治斗争的人数达一亿二千万人次。敌人暂时占领的各个城市，已经成为美国侵略军及其走狗脚下正在燃烧着的火山。
    公报指出，在越南南方，已经建立起一个占五分之四土地和三分之二人口的广大解放区，这里的人民实现了自己当家作主的权利。尽管敌人进行疯狂的“扫荡”和轰炸破坏，但是解放区人民仍然坚持生产和战斗。
    公报接着着重谈到一九六六年和一九六七年越南南方军民在同美国侵略者进行无比激烈的斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    公报说，一九六五年七月，在“特种战争”遭到失败、伪军和伪政权正在迅速崩溃的情况下，美国匆忙向越南南方大规模增派美军，进行“局部战争”。美国侵略者，妄图用它的强大的军事潜力和一切野蛮手段，迫使南越人民屈服。
    公报指出，对越南南方人民来说，同人数众多又有现代化装备的美国侵略军打仗，这还是前所未有过的事情。南方军民边打边总结经验，已经初步得出了一个重要的结论：南方军民运用自己的作战方法，可以消灭美军的建制单位，不管它是步兵或是机械化部队。在一九六五——一九六六年冬春季，南方军民胜利地粉碎了美帝国主义的第一次“旱季战略反攻”，歼敌十一万名（其中包括美军和帮凶军四万多名），全歼敌军三十个营（其中包括美军和帮凶军十四个步兵营）。进入一九六六——一九六七年冬春季，美国侵略者把美军总数增加到四十万名，使美伪军总数达一百万名以上，同时，把装甲车、大炮和战斗机的数量都增加了一倍。它们提出了“寻歼”和“绥靖”的所谓“钳形攻势”战略计划，妄想夺取决定性的胜利。但是，敌人的“第二次旱季反攻”同样又遭到了惨败，在这期间，南方军民共消灭敌军十七万五千名（其中包括美军七万名），使四十九个营和相当于营的单位丧失了战斗力（其中包括美军二十八个营），击毁飞机成千架和大炮成百门。
    这样，在同美帝国主义进行直接较量的两年中（截至一九六七年十二月十三日止），据不完全统计，南方军民共消灭和瓦解敌人近八十万名（其中美军和帮凶军近三十万名，歼灭美伪军建制单位一百二十个营和六百八十四个连）；击落击毁敌机五千三百三十架；击毁军车一万一千八百辆，击沉船艇二百九十七艘。在这期间有近十五万名伪军士兵开小差。
    公报说，南方军民在军事上取得巨大胜利的同时，在政治上也取得了十分巨大的胜利。在敌人暂时占领区，反对阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团，要求美军及其帮凶军必须撤出越南南方的群众运动有了蓬勃发展，伪政权的内部矛盾也空前尖锐化，阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团的卖国面目已经暴露无遗。从一九六七年年初以来，美伪集团采取通过伪“宪法”、进行伪选等等欺骗手段，企图为伪政权涂脂抹粉。但是，它们狡诈的“选举”丑剧，遭到了敌占区广大人民的抵制，阮文绍—阮高其集团陷于空前孤立。
    公报指出，越南南方民族解放阵线的国际威信越来越高。越南南方人民的正义斗争获得了全世界千百万人民的同情和支持。民族解放阵线的政治纲领得到了许多国家和世界各国人民的热烈欢迎和支持。反对美国侵略越南的运动，正在各地蓬勃高涨。
    公报指出，从越南南方民族解放阵线成立以来所走过的历程，可以得出以下几个结论：
    一、越南南方人民已经走过和正在走的道路，是完全正确的。越南南方民族解放阵线正确的斗争路线，把全体越南南方人民团结在抗美救国战斗的行列中，革命英雄主义精神和一切潜力得到高度发扬，使敌人空前孤立，使伪政权内部四分五裂，使伪军迅速瓦解。
    二、越南南方人民在反对一个既残暴又拥有强大军事力量的敌人的战斗中，已经找到了夺取胜利的方式。南方人民通过实际斗争，在“局部战争”条件下，创造了许多新的作战方法，掌握了夺取战场主动权的钥匙，为今后夺取更大的胜利打下了基础。
    三、美帝国主义越加强侵略战争，就越遭到可耻的失败。它向南方增兵越多，伤亡数字就越成倍地增长。当美军总数是四十万人的时候，它一年的伤亡数字约占总数的四分之一，但当美军总数达到四十七万人的时候，它一年来的伤亡数字却达到总数的三分之一。即使美军增加更多，南越军民也决心战胜并且必将战胜它。
    四、越南南方军民目前的斗争形势非常有利。一九六七——一九六八年冬春季最初几个月的辉煌胜利，给越南南方军民的抗美救国斗争，提供了更加有利的条件。南方军民正在稳操战场上的主动权。
    公报最后强调指出，虽然形势十分有利，但是越南南方人民懂得，未来的战斗将是无比激烈的。顽固的美帝国主义侵略者是决不会甘心失败的。越南南方军民必须冲上前去，更猛烈、更连续和更广泛地打击敌人，坚决夺取更巨大和更全面的胜利。在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，任何阻力都阻挡不了南方军民的坚定的前进步伐。
