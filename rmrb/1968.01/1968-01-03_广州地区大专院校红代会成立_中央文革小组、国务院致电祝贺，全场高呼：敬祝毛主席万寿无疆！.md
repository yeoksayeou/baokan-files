In the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the mass movement of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, the Representative Congress of Red Guards from Higher Education Institutions in Guangzhou was established on December 30, 1967. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangzhou.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group and the State Council sent a telegram of congratulations to the congress. When the telegram was read at the congress, the entire audience cheered enthusiastically and erupted in prolonged thunderous applause. People repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever! Forever!" The revolutionary Red Guards said, this is the greatest support, greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur from the great commander Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call and determine to be revolutionaries who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Leaders from the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee, including Huang Yongsheng, Chen Yu, Kong Shiquan, Qiu Guoguang, and Yan Zhichuan, leaders from the PLA units stationed in Guangzhou, leaders from relevant departments, and over 5,000 revolutionary teachers and students from higher education institutions in Guangzhou attended the congress.

In the opening speech to the congress, the representative of the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in Guangzhou said, the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in Guangzhou was established under the loving care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the strong support of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee. During the preparation process, the revolutionary Red Guards in Guangzhou responded to Chairman Mao's call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," fiercely fought against selfishness, and established selflessness. They overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they resumed classes and made revolution, achieving revolutionary great unity among the Red Guards in higher education institutions in Guangzhou by system and by class. We must continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, hold high the great red banner of Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, and achieve new victories in the proletarian educational revolution.

The Red Guard representatives who spoke at the congress unanimously emphasized that the People's Liberation Army is a powerful pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Guangzhou is located on the front line of national defense, and class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. We must hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," firmly unite with the People's Liberation Army of China, fight together, and win together. We must be highly vigilant and prevent class enemies from interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right or ultra-"left" side, and disrupting our revolutionary great unity.

Kong Shiquan, a leader of the Guangdong Revolutionary Preparatory Committee, spoke at the congress and warmly congratulated the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in Guangzhou. In his speech, he hoped that the young Red Guards would immediately launch a mass movement to study and implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on educational revolution, and let Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution forever occupy all educational positions.

Task Zhitong, a leader of the Guangzhou Military Region, and Huang Ronghai, a leader of the Guangdong Military Region, also spoke at the congress, expressing warm congratulations and firm support for the congress. They said they would resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people," firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work.

Representatives from the Preparatory Committee for the Revolutionary Great Unity of the Guangzhou Working Class, representatives from the poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs, and representatives from the Red Guards of middle schools also spoke at the congress. They unanimously hoped that the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in Guangzhou would establish new merits in consolidating and developing the revolutionary great unity in Guangzhou, promoting and achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, extensively and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle-transformation in their own units, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangzhou through to the end.

In the midst of enthusiastic applause and cheers, the congress unanimously passed a telegram of respect to our great leader Chairman Mao.
