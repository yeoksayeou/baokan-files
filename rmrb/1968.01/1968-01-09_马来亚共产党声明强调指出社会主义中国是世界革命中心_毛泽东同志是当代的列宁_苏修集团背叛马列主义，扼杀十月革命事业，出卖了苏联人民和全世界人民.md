The Malayan Communist Party recently stated in its declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution: "Experience has repeatedly proven that Comrade Mao Zedong is indeed the Lenin of our time, Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era, and the Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is the vanguard of the world revolution. Socialist China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is the center of the world revolution."

The declaration states: The great teacher of the proletariat, Lenin, led the October Revolution of 1917, establishing on one-sixth of the Earth's land the first proletarian dictatorship in human history. It ushered in a new era for humanity and showed the oppressed nations and peoples of the world the path to liberation.

The declaration states: "The banner of the great October Revolution is the banner of violent revolution. Only by raising this brilliant banner of violent revolution can the oppressed nations and peoples thoroughly overthrow the violent rule of the exploiting classes and achieve complete liberation."

The declaration states: "After the death of Stalin, the modern revisionist group, represented by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, usurped the leadership of the Soviet Party and government. They thus strangled the cause of the October Socialist Revolution and betrayed the Soviet and world peoples."

The declaration states: "When the Soviet revisionist traitor group completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism, the great leader and teacher of the contemporary world revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, brilliantly and comprehensively defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to the level of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong systematically summarized the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship, solving a series of theoretical and practical problems in advancing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, making extremely valuable contributions to the international communist movement. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong. It has achieved decisive victories and, like the October Revolution, has shaken the world. It not only prevented the restoration of capitalism, further consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, but also opened the road to communism." The declaration states: "The Malayan Communist Party and the revolutionary people of Malaya enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe that under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, the great Soviet people will be able to overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor group, rebuild the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and bring the Soviet Union back to the path of socialism. The peoples of the world will certainly achieve final victory in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries."

The declaration states: "On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, we are determined to study and apply more diligently the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

"We will unite closely with the great Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist brother parties to fight to the end against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor group.

"We will follow the path opened by the October Revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in and further develop our armed struggle, and fight to the end to overthrow the puppet regime of Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew, which is supported by imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitor group, and establish a new, truly independent, unified, and democratic Malaya."

    马来亚共产党声明强调指出社会主义中国是世界革命中心
    毛泽东同志是当代的列宁
    苏修集团背叛马列主义，扼杀十月革命事业，出卖了苏联人民和全世界人民
    新华社八日讯　马来亚共产党最近在关于伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的声明中强调说：“经验一再证明，毛泽东同志确是当代的列宁，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党是世界革命的旗手，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的社会主义中国是世界革命的中心。”
    声明说：无产阶级的伟大导师列宁所领导的一九一七年十月革命，在地球六分之一的土地上建立了人类历史上第一个无产阶级专政的国家。它使得人类历史进入了一个新时代，给全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民指出了争取解放的道路。
    声明说：“伟大十月革命的旗帜就是暴力革命的旗帜。各被压迫民族和被压迫人民只有高举暴力革命这一光辉的旗帜，才能够胜利地推翻剥削阶级的暴力统治，取得彻底的解放。”
    声明说：“在斯大林逝世以后，以赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫和柯西金为代表的现代修正主义集团篡夺了苏联党和政府的领导。他们就这样扼杀了十月社会主义革命事业，出卖了苏联人民和全世界人民。”
    声明说：“当苏联修正主义叛徒集团彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义的时候，当代世界革命的伟大导师和领袖毛泽东同志天才地、全面地坚决捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把它提高到了毛泽东思想的阶段。毛泽东同志系统地总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，解决了在无产阶级专政下把革命推向前进的一系列理论和实际问题，为国际共产主义运动作出了极其宝贵的贡献。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的。它已取得决定性胜利，并象十月革命一样震撼世界。它不仅防止了资本主义复辟，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，而且还开辟了通向共产主义的大道。”声明说：“马来亚共产党人和马来亚革命人民热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热情欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们完全相信，伟大的苏联人民在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指导下，定能推翻苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建光荣的苏联共产党，使苏联回到社会主义的道路上来。世界人民在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争中必将取得最后胜利。”
    声明说：“在纪念十月革命五十周年的时候，我们决心更加努力活学活用当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想。
    “我们将同伟大的中国共产党和其他马克思列宁主义的兄弟党紧紧地团结在一起，为推翻以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义而斗争到底。
    “我们将沿着十月革命所开辟的道路，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持并进一步发展我们的武装斗争，为推翻得到帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团支持的拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡政权而斗争到底，建立一个新的、真正独立的、统一民主的马来亚。”
