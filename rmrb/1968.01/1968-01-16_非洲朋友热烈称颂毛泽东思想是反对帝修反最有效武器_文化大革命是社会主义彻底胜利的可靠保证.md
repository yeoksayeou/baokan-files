According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, recently, friends from Southwest Africa, Burundi, and Morocco have warmly praised the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

An article written by two friends from the Southwest African People's Organization states: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, who personally initiated and led the unprecedented Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the creative power of the Chinese people has reached a new height."

The article states: "The fundamental purpose of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is to prevent the emergence of revisionism in China and the restoration of capitalism, to prevent the tragedy of the Soviet Union from being repeated, to ensure the continued development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in all aspects, and to provide a reliable guarantee for the ultimate victory of socialism."

The article points out: "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. This great revolution has made the Chinese people more closely united around the firm Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong."

These two friends point out in the article that the most distinctive feature of this cultural revolution is that it is an unprecedented mass movement led by the billions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary Red Guards, with Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle. It is a great school, where the masses, especially the younger generation, are undergoing revolutionary tempering. This is a crucial issue concerning the future of China and the world, because the youth are the successors of the revolution.

These two friends say: Today, it is clear that China has become the center of world revolution and a reliable force for the revolutionary people of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the world. Therefore, this cultural revolution is also a great support and encouragement to the people fighting in the world. Despite the rumors and slanders spread by American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, the power of this cultural revolution is irresistible.

These two friends say: "The Chinese people are making inspiring progress in carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. All of these have created extremely favorable conditions for the spread of Mao Zedong Thought—the spiritual atomic bomb of the oppressed people. Mao Zedong Thought is the living truth of Marxism-Leninism in the era when socialism is marching towards world victory and imperialism and its running dogs are in their death throes. Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective weapon for revolutionaries to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. Mao Zedong Thought teaches the oppressed people to take up arms and fight for true liberation, while modern revisionists attempt to undermine the revolutionary will of the people."

These two African friends finally shout: Long live the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!

Recently, Burundian students studying in Europe held a meeting in Brussels, where they warmly praised the great leader Chairman Mao, who personally initiated and led the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They believe that this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution has great international significance and will accelerate the process of the collapse of imperialism and the world revolutionary people marching towards socialism. They also believe that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has greatly inspired the great enthusiasm of the Chinese people, achieving brilliant results in economic construction and scientific experiments, especially successfully detonating the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb in just a few years, thus breaking the nuclear monopoly of American imperialism and its accomplices.

They also passed a resolution supporting the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

A friend from Morocco said regarding the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution that the Moroccan people are closely watching and fully supporting the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, and to be a revolutionary, one must accept Mao Zedong Thought as a guide.

    非洲朋友热烈称颂毛泽东思想是反对帝修反最有效武器
    文化大革命是社会主义彻底胜利的可靠保证
    据新华社讯　最近，西南非洲、布隆迪、摩洛哥的非洲朋友热烈赞颂取得伟大胜利的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    西南非洲民族联盟两位朋友写的一篇文章说：“在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，今天中国人民的创造力量达到了新的高涨。”
    文章说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的是在中国防止出现修正主义和防止复辟资本主义，防止重演苏联的悲剧，保证社会主义革命和社会主义建设在各方面继续发展，为社会主义的彻底胜利提供可靠保证。”
    文章指出：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是对以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联修正主义和各国反动派的沉重打击。这场大革命使全体中国人民更加紧密地团结在以毛泽东主席为代表的坚定的马克思列宁主义的革命路线的周围。”
    这两位朋友在文章中指出，这场文化大革命最突出的特点是：它是以毛泽东思想作为行动指南的亿万工农兵和革命的红卫兵的史无前例的群众运动。它是一所大学校，广大的群众，特别是年青一代，正在这所学校里受革命锻炼，这是一个关系到中国前途和世界前途的重要问题，因为青年是革命的接班人。
    这两位朋友说：今天，很明显，中国已经成为世界革命的中心，成为非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界革命人民的可靠力量。因此，这场文化大革命也是对全世界斗争中的人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。尽管美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者散布谣言和进行诽谤，但这场文化大革命的威力是无法抵抗的。
    这两位朋友说：“中国人民在进行无产阶级文化大革命和在巩固无产阶级专政方面正在取得振奋人心的进展，所有这些都为传播毛泽东思想——被压迫人民的精神原子弹创造了极为有利的条件。毛泽东思想是在社会主义走向全世界胜利，帝国主义及其走狗垂死挣扎的时代的马克思列宁主义的活的真理。毛泽东思想是革命者反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最有效的武器。毛泽东思想教导被压迫人民拿起武器，为真正的解放而斗争，而现代修正主义者却企图破坏人民的革命斗志。”
    这两位非洲朋友最后高呼：中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！
    布隆迪留欧学生不久前在布鲁塞尔举行会议，热烈赞扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们认为，这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命具有重大的国际意义，必将加速帝国主义的灭亡和世界革命人民走向社会主义的进程。他们还认为，中国无产阶级文化大革命大大激发了中国人民的巨大热情，使得在经济建设和科学试验方面都取得了辉煌的成就，特别是在短短的几年中成功地爆炸了原子弹和氢弹，从而打破了美帝国主义及其帮凶的核垄断。
    他们还通过了支持中国无产阶级文化大革命的决议。
    一位摩洛哥朋友谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时说，摩洛哥人民密切地注视着并完全支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席已经把马克思列宁主义发展到一个新阶段，做一个革命者，就必须接受毛泽东思想作为指导。
