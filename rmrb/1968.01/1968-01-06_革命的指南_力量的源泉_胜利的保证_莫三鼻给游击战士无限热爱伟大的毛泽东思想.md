In southern Africa, the Mozambican guerrilla fighters who are bravely fighting to overthrow the Portuguese colonial rule supported by the United States, deeply love the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. In their actual struggles, they deeply feel that to make a revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the Mozambican people's struggle for victory. Therefore, with profound class feelings, they diligently study Chairman Mao's works. They arm themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggles.

Yearning for the Red Book Day and Night

The Mozambican guerrilla fighters all yearn day and night to have the opportunity to obtain a copy of the red book. One day, a batch of Mozambican guerrilla fighters from the front lines of the struggle obtained the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." At that time, their emotions were extremely excited. They spontaneously sang the song "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" over and over again, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

A guerrilla fighter from a peasant family, Asanai, placed the red book on his chest, with tears of excitement in his eyes, and said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon. Obtaining the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I feel warm in my heart." Another fighter said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the liberation struggle of the Mozambican people in Africa. I will cherish the Chairman's book as I cherish my eyes and will use the Chairman's thoughts to guide our revolutionary struggle."

Following Chairman Mao's Instructions to Carry the Revolution to the End

Many Mozambican guerrilla fighters, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Constantly Read Articles," decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people wholeheartedly and carry the revolution to the end.

A young fighter named Dimaka, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," said, "Chairman Mao is the most brilliant and greatest internationalist. He has given great support and encouragement to the liberation struggle of the African people. We will definitely overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and colonialism and achieve complete independence and liberation. Because Chairman Mao is with us." A guerrilla fighter who had once been to the Soviet Union said, "Some people advise us to achieve independence through 'peaceful negotiations,' which is simply deception; if we accept this proposal, the revolution will be half-hearted, and we will not gain true independence. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, serve the people wholeheartedly, and carry the revolution to the end."

Distinguishing Enemies and Friends, Defeating the Colonialists

Guerrilla fighter Adanasio is a young peasant. His family's fate, like that of all the laboring people of Mozambique in Africa, has suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism and colonialism. Because of resisting the Portuguese colonial authorities, his entire family was once arrested and imprisoned, and his mother and sister are still in prison suffering torture. After reading Chairman Mao's famous work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," he, with strong national hatred and class resentment, denounced the crimes committed by the Portuguese colonialists and their running dogs in Mozambique. When he talked about how Portuguese plantation owners carried out "forced labor" and even buried alive Africans who had lost their ability to work, he wept uncontrollably. He firmly said, "The people of Mozambique in Africa are suffering. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, distinguish between enemies and friends, defeat the Portuguese colonialists, and liberate our nation." Another revolutionary fighter pointed out, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution.' In Mozambique, imperialists, Portuguese colonialists, and their running dogs are the main enemies of the Mozambican people."

The Mozambican guerrilla fighters who persist in armed struggle deeply love and admire the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. A fighter emphasized, "Sprouts cannot be separated from the soil, revolutionaries cannot be separated from Chairman Mao, and cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought." They diligently study Chairman Mao's military thoughts. Many fighters can recite Chairman Mao's quotations and sing songs praising Chairman Mao. They say, "Chairman Mao is not only the savior of the Chinese people but also the savior of the people of the world. He is the eternal red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world."

    革命的指南　力量的源泉　胜利的保证
    莫三鼻给游击战士无限热爱伟大的毛泽东思想
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　在南部非洲，正在为推翻美国支持下的葡萄牙殖民统治而英勇战斗的莫三鼻给游击战士，无限热爱世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。他们在实际斗争中深深地体会到：干革命要靠毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想是莫三鼻给人民斗争取得胜利的指路明灯。因此，他们怀着深厚的阶级感情，勤奋地学习毛主席著作。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来武装自己，指导自己的斗争。
    日夜渴望得到红色宝书
    莫三鼻给的游击战士们，都日夜渴望自己能有机会得到一本红色宝书。有一天，一批来自斗争前线的莫三鼻给游击战士得到了红彤彤的葡萄牙文《毛主席语录》。当时，他们的心情非常激动。他们情不自禁地一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》歌曲，不断振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    农民家庭出身的战士阿萨奈把红色宝书放在胸前，眼里闪着激动的泪花，他说：“毛泽东思想是强大的思想武器，得到《毛主席语录》，我从心底里感到温暖。”另一位战士说：“毛泽东思想是指导我们莫三鼻给非洲人民求解放的指路明灯。我要象爱护眼珠一样，爱护毛主席的宝书，要用毛主席的思想来指导我们的革命斗争。”
    遵循毛主席教导　将革命进行到底
    许多莫三鼻给游击战士学习毛主席光辉著作“老三篇”后，决心按照毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，将革命进行到底。
    一个名叫第马卡的青年战士在学习了《纪念白求恩》后说：“毛主席是最光辉、最伟大的国际主义者，他给了我们非洲人民的解放斗争以巨大的支持和鼓舞。我们一定能够彻底推翻帝国主义、殖民主义的反动统治，一定能够取得彻底的独立和解放。因为毛主席和我们在一起。”一位曾经到过苏联的游击战士说：“有人劝我们通过‘和平谈判’取得独立，那简直是欺骗；如果接受这种主张，就会使革命半途而废，就不能获得真正的独立，我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务，将革命进行到底。”
    分清敌友　打倒殖民者
    游击战士阿达纳西奥是一个青年农民，他家庭的命运和所有莫三鼻给非洲劳苦人民一样，受尽帝国主义和殖民主义的残酷压迫和剥削。由于反抗葡萄牙殖民当局，他全家人曾被捕入狱，他母亲和妹妹至今仍在监狱中遭受折磨。他读了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》的著名著作后，怀着强烈的民族仇，阶级恨，控诉了葡萄牙殖民主义者及其走狗在莫三鼻给犯下的滔天罪行。当他谈到葡萄牙农场主如何进行“强迫劳动”甚至把丧失劳动力的非洲人加以活埋时，他泣不成声。他坚定地说：“我们莫三鼻给非洲人民正在受难。我们必须遵照毛主席的指示，分清敌友，打倒葡萄牙殖民主义者，解放我们的民族”。另一位革命战士指出：“毛主席教导我们说：‘谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。’在莫三鼻给，帝国主义者、葡萄牙殖民主义者及其走狗是莫三鼻给人民的主要敌人。”
    坚持武装斗争的莫三鼻给游击战士们对世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限崇拜。一位战士强调指出：“青苗离不开土地，革命者离不开毛主席，离不开毛泽东思想。”他们勤奋地钻研毛主席的军事思想。许多战士都能背诵毛主席语录，会唱歌颂毛主席的歌曲。他们说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民而且是世界人民的大救星，是中国人民和世界人民心中永远不落的红太阳。”
