On December 6th of last year, a passenger bus arrived at the Shuiliangling station. Since the bus was already full, the conductor repeatedly explained to the passengers waiting at the station, asking them to wait for another bus. That day, the weather was very cold, and everyone wanted to get on the bus as soon as possible. Seven soldiers who were on the bus saw this situation and thought, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Serve the people wholeheartedly, never part from the masses...'. Can we just watch as our fellow villagers can't get on the bus? Our mission is not that urgent, we should give the convenience to the people and leave the difficulties to ourselves." Therefore, the seven soldiers spontaneously said to the conductor, "It's only about ten li to Yongquan Brigade, we'll get off and walk, let these fellow villagers get on the bus!"

The driver and the conductor tried to persuade them, saying, "No, comrades, how can you walk with such big luggage?" The soldiers replied firmly, "We can! We are the children of the people, loving the people is our duty." As they spoke, they got off the bus, carrying their luggage and backpacks, and walked towards Yongquan Brigade with cheerful and vigorous steps.

    让车记
    去年十二月六日，一辆客车行驶到水獭岭车站时，因为车已经满员了，乘务员一再向站上的旅客解释，请他们再等一辆。这天的天气很冷，大家都想早点坐上车。乘坐这次客车的七名解放军同志看到这种情况，心想，毛主席教导我们：
  “全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众……”。能眼看着老乡们坐不上车吗？我们的任务也并不是太紧急的，应该把方便让给群众，把困难留给自己。于是，七个人不约而同地向乘务员说：
  “到永泉大队只有十几里路了，我们下车走着去，让这几位老乡上车吧！”司机和乘务员劝阻说：“不行啊，同志，你们扛着那么大的行李包怎么走啊！”解放军同志回答得很干脆：“行！我们是人民的子弟兵，爱民是我们的天职。”他们边说边走下了车厢，扛着行李背着背包，迈着愉快而雄健的步伐向永泉大队走去。
