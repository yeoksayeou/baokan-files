“Liberate oneself from private property concepts!” This is the bold slogan put forth by the residents of Chongwen District.

Sixty-seven-year-old Wang Hongliang, after retiring, was influenced by the exploitative class's ideology, feeling that he was old and should enjoy his life, planning to “spend a good retirement.” He then started raising chickens, rabbits, and birds at home, was unwilling to attend meetings, and did not want to manage collective affairs. Everyone called him “old laggard.” Recently, after being persuaded by the neighborhood committee director Wang Shun, he participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, he recalled the hardships of pulling a cart in the wind and rain for the capitalists in the old society, contrasted with today's happy life, and felt that “parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer.” He then memorized Chairman Mao's works, learning and reciting one sentence at a time, using one sentence at a time. After studying the “Three Articles,” he fiercely criticized the “self” in his mind. He thought: Raising birds is what the landlords and capitalists in the old society did. How could I, a person from a poor background, do this! He released the birds. He said: I released not just a bird, but a “self”! From then on, Wang Hongliang, regardless of his age, braved the cold and worked day and night for the collective and the residents. He bought materials and painted Mao Zedong quotations; he made stoves and cleaned for the study class; he swept the yard for the families of martyrs and soldiers; he took care of children for the propaganda team. If there was no work to do, he felt itchy. The masses called him “restless,” saying he had become another person.

Wang Rongzhi is a worker's wife who suffered greatly in the old society. She is always grateful for Chairman Mao's kindness and will wholeheartedly do whatever Chairman Mao calls for. Over the past few months, she heard people talk about “criticize self and oppose revisionism” every day, but she did not understand what “criticize self and oppose revisionism” meant. Later, she heard that this was a call from our great leader Chairman Mao, and she wanted to understand it even more. A few days ago, the neighborhood started a study class, which was about criticizing self and opposing revisionism. Wang Rongzhi actively signed up to participate. Through study, she understood this truth: If the “self” is not criticized, revisionism will be produced, the country will change color, and millions of laboring people will suffer twice, returning to the hell on earth during the rule of the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism. Wang Rongzhi understood this, and her study enthusiasm grew. Every day, she prepared meals for the children, sometimes not eating herself, and went to the study class; she did not finish making cotton clothes, studying during the day and making them at night. In the past, she rarely participated in meetings and would get lost when she went out. Now it is different; she often participates in parades and gatherings, delaying household chores but never missing a meeting. She said: No matter how small the country's affairs are, they are big; no matter how big personal affairs are, they are small. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words: care about the country's affairs.

The masses praised: Wang Rongzhi entered the study class, studied Chairman Mao's works, and opened her mind!

     街道居民毛泽东思想学习班，主要解决什么问题？崇文区居民回答：斗私批修
    从私有观念中解放出来
   “从私有观念中解放出来！”这是崇文区居民提出的豪迈口号。
    六十七岁的王洪亮，退职以后，由于受了剥削阶级思想的影响，觉得自己老了，应该享受享受了，准备“好好度个晚年”。于是，便在家里养鸡、养兔、养鸟，开会不愿参加，集体的事情不想管了。大家称他“老落后”。最近，经过居委会主任王沄动员，他参加了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班上，他回忆了在旧社会风里雨里给资本家赶大车的苦楚，对比今天的幸福生活，感到爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲，便逐字逐句地背诵毛主席著作，学一句，背一句，背一句，用一句。学习“老三篇”以后，狠斗了自己头脑中的“私”字，他想：养鸟是旧社会那些地主资本家干的，我这穷苦人出身那能干这个！他把鸟放走了。他说：我放走的不是一只鸟，放走的是一个“私”字！从此，王洪亮不畏年高，不怕天寒地冻，日夜为集体操劳，为居民服务。买料买色，为街道制作毛主席语录牌；为学习班生炉子，打扫卫生；为烈军属打水扫院子。宣传队排节目，他照顾孩子。一没有活干，就好象觉得手痒。群众叫他“闲不住”，说他好象变成了另一个人。
    王荣芝，是一个在旧社会饱受苦难的工人妻子。她时刻感激着毛主席的恩情，只要她知道是毛主席的号召，就实心踏地去干。近几个月，她每天每天都听人讲“斗私批修”、“斗私批修”，但“斗私批修”到底是个什么意思，她不理解。后来听说是我们伟大领袖毛主席的号召，她更想弄个明白。前几天，街道上办起了学习班，就是斗私批修的。王荣芝积极报名参加。经过学习，她明白了这样一个道理：“私”字如果不斗，就要产生修正主义，国家就要变颜色，千千万万的劳动人民就要重受二茬罪，就要回到国民党、日本帝国主义统治时期的人间地狱。王荣芝明白了这一点，学习劲头可大了，每天给孩子们做好饭，有时顾不得吃，就去学习班；棉衣没做上，白天学习晚上做。往日，她很少参加会，出门就迷路，现在不同了，她经常参加游行、集会，宁可耽误家里活，决不误了开会。她说：国家的事再小，也是大事，个人的事再大，也是小事，我们就是要听毛主席的话：关心国家大事。
    群众赞扬说：王荣芝进了学习班，学习了毛主席著作，开了心窍！
