In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual.

In the soul, breaking selfishness, eagerly selling cotton

Liaoning Province's 1967 national cotton procurement plan exceeded by 11 percent

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 9th — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural people's communes of Liaoning Province, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, vigorously promoting revolution and production. After achieving a bumper cotton harvest, they eagerly sold cotton to the state. The 1967 national cotton procurement plan has been exceeded by 11 percent.

Under the inspiration of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of Liaoning Province resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "cotton must be grasped." With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army agricultural support troops, they overcame various natural disasters such as wind, hail, drought, and pests last year, achieving a bumper cotton harvest. After the cotton procurement began, the revolutionary committees at all levels, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction that "before every action, we must explain to the Party members and the masses the policies we have formulated according to the situation," convened three-level or four-level cadre meetings. They organized a large number of cadres to go deep among the masses to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies. Many cotton procurement stations were turned into propaganda stations for Mao Zedong Thought, and the staff became propagandists for Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." They universally set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, broke down "selfishness" and established "public-mindedness," correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and eagerly sold more cotton to the state. They completed the cotton sales task well, quickly, and in good quality.
