The South Vietnamese military and civilians have achieved a great and comprehensive victory in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. Last year, they annihilated 365,000 enemy troops and destroyed 3,200 enemy aircraft.

Hanoi, January 23, Xinhua News Agency — According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, the Command of the Vietnam South Liberation Armed Forces recently issued a report on the 1967 battle achievements, stating that the Vietnam South military and civilians last year highly promoted the spirit of revolutionary heroism, united as one, launched a people's war, and achieved a great victory of significant strategic importance. The report calls on the South Vietnamese military and civilians to make greater efforts, concentrate all their strength, talent, and wisdom, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and achieve even greater victories in 1968.

The report points out that the victories achieved by the Vietnam South military and civilians last year have the following notable characteristics:

1. The annihilation of the enemy's combat forces and the destruction of their war tools were more than in any previous year. According to incomplete statistics, in 1967 (excluding December figures), the South Vietnamese military and civilians killed and wounded nearly 365,000 enemy troops, including more than 170,000 American and mercenary troops. The annihilated enemy units included 73 battalions, 399 companies, and 680 platoons. At the same time, 3,200 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, 8,500 various military vehicles were blown up, 730 cannons were destroyed, more than 200 warships and gunboats were sunk, 38 locomotives and 101 train cars were destroyed, 560 bridges and many military warehouses were blown up.

Compared to 1965, the number of enemy troops annihilated in 1967 increased by more than half, with the number of American and mercenary troops annihilated increasing nearly eightfold; the number of enemy armored vehicles destroyed increased nearly ninefold; the number of enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed increased by one and a half times. Compared to 1966, the number of enemy troops annihilated increased by more than one-third, with the number of American and mercenary troops annihilated increasing by nearly half; the number of enemy armored vehicles destroyed increased by two and a half times; the number of enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed increased by more than half; the number of enemy warships and gunboats destroyed increased by one time.

2. The people's war has flourished throughout Vietnam South. All battlefields have fiercely attacked the enemy, coordinated, and achieved brilliant victories.

In the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region at the southern end of the temporary military demarcation line, the military and civilians have taken the initiative on the battlefield, continuously attacking and counterattacking the enemy. The three types of armed forces operating on this battlefield have closely coordinated, defeating the American and puppet forces, making them disorganized and losing their morale. The enemy's "pacification" teams have disintegrated. The enemy's main defensive lines on the 9th and 1st highways have been shaken.

The military and civilians in the central region have continuously and fiercely struck the enemy, achieving greater victories than in any previous year. On the Western Highlands battlefield, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in provinces such as Gia Lai have annihilated many enemy battalions and companies. The enemy's bases and cities, such as Kontum, Pleiku, An Khe, and Ban Me Thuot, have all been fiercely attacked. On the 19th strategic highway, the People's Liberation Armed Forces have launched many brilliant ambush battles, destroying more than a hundred enemy vehicles.

The military and civilians in the eastern region of the south have continuously launched attacks against the enemy, annihilating a large number of American and puppet troops. At the same time, they have also infiltrated the cities temporarily occupied by the enemy, supporting the people's uprising struggle.

The military and civilians in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region have fought very bravely, achieving many brilliant victories. In the countryside, they have not only achieved victories in anti-"sweeping" and anti-"pacification" struggles, defending important regions, but have also opened up new guerrilla bases. Coordinating with the countryside battles, they have also attacked the enemy's lair — Saigon City and many of the enemy's rear bases, especially during the enemy's puppet "president" inauguration ceremony, the People's Liberation Armed Forces shelled the "Independence Palace," striking fear into the enemy.

The military and civilians in the central region of the south have combined armed struggle with political struggle. They can conduct multiple battles simultaneously in a wide area, forming a comprehensive offensive against the enemy and annihilating a large number of enemy troops. The People's Liberation Armed Forces have also heavily struck the enemy's warships and gunboats on various rivers, thwarting the American army's plan to enter the Mekong Delta.

The military and civilians in the western region of the south have also annihilated a large number of enemy troops, defended the liberated areas, and opened up new guerrilla bases. They have continuously attacked cities, airports, and transportation lines, with frequent victories.

3. The enemy's rear bases and many towns, as well as military outposts, have been continuously and fiercely attacked.

Last year, most of the cities and more than a hundred towns occupied by the enemy were attacked by the People's Liberation Armed Forces. The People's Liberation Armed Forces also conducted nearly a hundred attacks on more than forty enemy airfields. In these attacks and raids, the People's Liberation Armed Forces have repeatedly destroyed the headquarters of the American and puppet forces and the puppet government, annihilated a large number of enemy combat forces, and destroyed many enemy war tools.

4. The enemy's "pacification" plan for the countryside has been shattered.

Last year, the Vietnam South military and civilians thwarted all large and small-scale "sweeping" operations launched by the American and puppet clique to implement the "pacification" plan, annihilating many enemy main force units that protected the "pacification" teams, and eliminating more than a hundred "pacification" teams (one-fifth of the total number of "pacification" teams). The remaining "pacification" teams are mostly in a state of paralysis.

5. The three types of armed forces have rapidly grown, closely coordinated, and continuously achieved battle victories.

The main forces have rapidly grown stronger, fiercely operating in various strategic regions, fighting well, and establishing many brilliant victories, truly serving as the backbone of all armed forces. The local forces have shown significant growth, with all aspects improving, able to effectively conduct anti-"sweeping" and anti-"pacification" battles. Many units can annihilate entire enemy companies and battalions. The militia and guerrilla forces, with their rich and varied combat methods, are active in various places, striking the enemy at any time, consuming the enemy's strength. They can also effectively coordinate with the main forces and local forces to conduct anti-"sweeping" and anti-"pacification" battles, defending the people and production, making a very important contribution to the anti-American and national salvation cause.

The report points out that the above-mentioned great victories prove that the Vietnam South military and civilians firmly grasp the strategic initiative on the battlefield, while the enemy is in chaos and passivity.

The victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians in 1967 are of extremely important strategic significance both militarily and politically. It proves that the South Vietnamese military and civilians are fighting stronger and winning more, while the American aggressors are fighting worse and losing more, finding no way out.

The report points out that in 1968, the Vietnam South military and civilians are determined to fight and win, while being highly vigilant against the new cunning and unscrupulous plots of the American aggressors. The battle will be even more intense and complex.

The report calls on the South Vietnamese military and civilians to advance bravely with a strong fighting will, a fierce offensive momentum, and the posture of victors, resolutely achieving the various revolutionary goals stipulated in the program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

    高度发扬革命英雄主义精神　大力开展人民战争　牢牢掌握战略主动权
    南越军民抗美救国战争取得伟大和全面胜利
    去年歼敌三十六万五千人毁敌机三千二百架
    新华社河内二十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部，最近发表的一九六七年战绩公报指出，越南南方军民去年高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，万众一心，大力开展人民战争，取得了具有重大战略意义的伟大胜利。公报号召南方军民作出更大的努力，集中一切力量、才能和智慧，克服一切艰苦和困难，夺取一九六八年的更大的胜利。
    公报指出，越南南方军民去年取得的胜利具有以下显著特点：
    一、消灭美伪军的有生力量和摧毁敌人的战争工具，比以往任何一年都多。
    据不完全统计，一九六七年（十二月份的数字未计算在内），南方军民打死打伤敌人近三十六万五千名，其中美军和帮凶军十七万多名。被歼灭的敌军单位包括七十三个营、三百九十九个连、六百八十个排。与此同时，击落和炸毁敌机三千二百架，炸毁各种军车八千五百辆，击毁大炮七百三十门，击沉战船和战艇二百多艘，炸毁机车三十八台和车厢一百零一节，炸毁桥梁五百六十多座以及许多军用仓库。
    与一九六五年相比，一九六七年敌人被歼数字增加半倍以上，其中美军和帮凶军被歼数字增加近八倍；敌人的装甲车被击毁数字增加近九倍；敌机被击落、击毁数字增加一倍半。与一九六六年相比，敌人被歼数字增加了三分之一强，其中美军和帮凶军被歼数字增加近半倍；敌人的装甲车被击毁数字增加二倍半；敌机被击落、击毁数字增加半倍以上；敌人战船和战艇被击毁数字增加一倍。
        二、人民战争在整个越南南
    方蓬勃发展。各个战场都猛烈地进攻敌人，配合协调，胜利辉
  煌。
    临时军事分界线南端的广治—承天地区的军民，掌握着战场上的主动权，连续地进攻和反击敌人。驰骋在这个战场上的三种武装力量紧密配合，打得美伪军狼狈不堪，威风扫地。敌人的“绥靖”队纷纷溃散瓦解。敌人在第九和第一号公路上的主要防线，都已动摇。
    中部地区军民连续地和猛烈地打击敌人，建立了比以往任何一年都大的战功。在西原战场上，人民解放武装力量在嘉莱等省，歼灭美伪军的许多个营、连。敌人的基地和城镇，如昆嵩、波来古、安溪、邦美蜀等，都遭到猛烈的袭击。在第十九号战略公路上，人民解放武装力量打了许多次漂亮的伏击战，毁伤敌人上百辆军车。
    南部东区军民，去年连续向敌人发起进攻，大量歼灭美伪军。同时，他们还深入敌人暂时占领着的市镇，支援群众的起义斗争。
    西贡—嘉定地区军民，进行了十分英勇的战斗，建立了许多辉煌战功。在农村，他们不仅取得了反“扫荡”、反“绥靖”斗争的胜利，保卫了重要的地区，而且还开辟了新的游击根据地。与农村的战斗相配合，他们还袭击了敌人的巢穴——西贡堤岸市以及敌人的许多后勤基地，特别是在敌人举行傀儡“总统”就职仪式的时候，人民解放武装力量炮击了“独立宫”，打得敌人惊恐万状。
    南部中区军民把武装斗争和政治斗争很好地结合起来。他们能够在同一时间内，在广阔的地区内，进行多场战斗，构成全面进攻敌人的战役歼灭大量敌人。人民解放武装力量还沉重地打击了各条河流上的敌人的战艇、战船，使美军进驻湄公河三角洲的阴谋无法实现。
    南部西区军民，去年也消灭了大量敌人，保卫了解放区，并且开辟了新的游击根据地。他们不断袭击城市、机场和交通线，捷报频传。
    三、接连猛烈地袭击了敌人的后方基地和许多城镇以及敌军据点。
    去年，敌人占据的大部分城市和上百个市镇，都遭到人民解放武装力量的进攻。人民解放武装力量还对四十多个敌人的机场进行了近百次的袭击。在这些进攻和袭击中，人民解放武装力量多次击毁了美、伪军和伪政权的首脑机关，消灭了敌人的大量有生力量，击毁了敌人的许多战争工具。
        四、粉碎了敌人“绥靖”农村的计划。
    去年，越南南方军民挫败了美伪集团为实现“绥靖”计划而发动的各次大小规模的“扫荡”，歼灭了掩护“绥靖”队的许多敌军主力部队，消灭了一百多个“绥靖”队（占“绥靖”队总数的五分之一）。剩下的大部分“绥靖”队已处于瘫痪状态。
     五、三种武装力量迅速成长，配合紧密，不断取得战斗胜利。
    主力部队迅速壮大，坚强地纵横驰骋在各个战略地区，他们打得好，建立了许多辉煌战功，不愧为各种武装力量的骨干。地方部队有了显著的成长，各方面的水平都有所提高，能够很好地进行反“扫荡”、反“绥靖”战斗。许多单位已能歼灭整连整营的敌人。民兵游击队以丰富多采的作战方法，活跃在各个地方，随时打击敌人，消耗敌人的力量。他们并能很好地配合主力部队和地方部队进行反“扫荡”、反“绥靖”战斗，保卫了人民、保卫了生产，为抗美救国事业作出了十分重要的贡献。
    公报指出，上述巨大的胜利，证明了越南南方军民牢牢掌握战场上的战略主动权，而敌人则陷于混乱和被动。
    南方军民在一九六七年取得的胜利，是在军事和政治上具有极其重大战略意义的伟大和全面的胜利。它证明了南方军民越战越强，越战越胜，美国侵略强盗则越战越败，越败越找不到出路。
    公报指出，一九六八年，越南南方军民决心战斗，决心夺取胜利，同时，十分警惕美国强盗耍弄新的狡猾的、不可告人的阴谋。战斗还将更加激烈和复杂。
    公报号召南方军民以坚强的战斗决心，以猛烈进攻的气势和战胜者的姿态英勇前进，坚决实现越南南方民族解放阵线纲领中所规定的各项革命目标。（附图片）
