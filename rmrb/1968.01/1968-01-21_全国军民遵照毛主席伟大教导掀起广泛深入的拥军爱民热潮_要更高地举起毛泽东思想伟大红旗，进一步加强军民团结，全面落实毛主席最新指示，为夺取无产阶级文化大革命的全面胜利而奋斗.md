Nationwide military and civilians, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have launched a widespread and in-depth campaign of supporting the army and loving the people. They must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen military-civilian unity, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups in various provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Gansu, Hangzhou, and Qingdao have recently held meetings or issued decisions and notices. They require revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to carry out more extensive and in-depth support-the-army activities during the New Year and Spring Festival. They must firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, support and love the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work. They must strengthen military-civilian unity and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since January, places like Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Jiangxi, and Guizhou have been enthusiastically carrying out support-the-army activities. The revolutionary committees at various levels in Heilongjiang Province have organized a large number of active learners and model supporters of Chairman Mao's works, carrying the "Little Red Book" and Chairman Mao's badges, holding Chairman Mao's portraits, and visiting border outposts and military camps to comfort the soldiers. They also exchange experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers. Various ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have formed visiting teams, starting from January 12th, visiting various places in the province to comfort the People's Liberation Army and families of martyrs, military families, and demobilized soldiers. On January 20th, the revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army in the Xining area of Qinghai held a support-the-army and love-the-people rally. Various prefectures and counties in the province have also successively carried out "support-the-army and love-the-people month" activities. The Xiantan area in Hunan Province held a rally of 20,000 people to support the army and love the people before the New Year, and held several military-civilian joint celebrations in early January, pushing the activity of learning from the People's Liberation Army to a new high. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan, invited soldiers to production teams or their own homes to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Various departments, factories, schools, and people's communes in the Zhangjiakou area of Hebei Province have launched a wave of learning from the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong. The students of Tianjin's Yan'an Middle School have all signed "support-the-army agreements," and each person has made a plan to learn from the People's Liberation Army. Some classes hold discussions on the topic "What have you learned from the People's Liberation Army?" and some classes invite soldiers to help them rectify their work style. The entire school's support-the-army activities are very lively.

In the support-the-army activities, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places hold various forms of discussions and reports, using their personal experiences to enthusiastically praise the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past more than a year. They have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching that "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The revolutionary cadres in the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei Province said that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shijiazhuang firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strongly supported the revolutionary cadres, and achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shijiazhuang area. They expressed their determination to learn better from the People's Liberation Army, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary cadres in Inner Mongolia and Guizhou enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army for helping them set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Guiyang Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has held more than 40 Mao Zedong Thought study classes since last June, with 80% of the workers taking turns to study in the classes. Revolutionary workers, through criticizing and repudiating revisionism, have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

In the support-the-army activities, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places have launched a wave of learning from the People's Liberation Army. They believe that the most fundamental thing in learning from the People's Liberation Army is to be as loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the People's Liberation Army. They must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making sure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented. Deputy Director of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and Secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Committee, Chen Yonggui, said, "We learn from the People's Liberation Army to be as loyal to Chairman Mao as the People's Liberation Army, fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and sacrificing for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must implement Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest deviation and follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment without the slightest delay, making the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in Dazhai, in all of Shanxi, and in all of China forever." Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Wuhan decided to be revolutionary fighters forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, just like the People's Liberation Army. Workers at the Beijing Knitting Factory learned from the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed in the factory, insisting on reading Chairman Mao's books every day and doing everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, they have made a 1968 annual battle plan according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Workers in Class C of the Guiyang Cotton Mill have implemented the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style of the People's Liberation Army at the grassroots level, further enhancing the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the worker team, and strongly promoting the revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, the People's Liberation Army of the army, navy, and air force has actively implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." Since the New Year, they have further extensively carried out love-the-people activities.

The headquarters of various armies, various military branches, and the leadership organs of the Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and Kunming garrisons, as well as the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, have issued notices to their subordinate troops about carrying out love-the-people activities during the New Year and Spring Festival. They require the broad cadres and soldiers to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," carry forward the fine tradition of loving the people in our army, immediately launch a widespread, in-depth, and enthusiastic love-the-people campaign, strengthen military-civilian unity, and contribute their greatest efforts to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The leadership organs of the Engineering Corps, Railway Corps, Armored Corps, Chemical Defense Corps, and Beijing Garrison have held love-the-people mobilization meetings. The responsible comrades of these units have attended the meetings and spoken at the meetings.

In the love-the-people activities, various troops have taken the thorough propaganda and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level as the center. Tens of thousands of cadres and soldiers have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, rushed to factories, rural areas, schools, and streets, and enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions directly face the broad revolutionary masses, take root in the hearts of the revolutionary masses, and turn into practical actions. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison invited representatives from 20 counties' Mao Zedong Thought study classes and 29 factories, schools, and production brigades to participate in the love-the-people evening held by the unit to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions in seven days. This greatly promoted the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in these units. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sent by the troops in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chengdu have been active in cities, rural areas, mountain fortresses, and islands, propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sent by the unit where Liu Yingjun was stationed propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in six counties, three suburban districts, and 23 people's communes, making some groups that had been fighting "internal wars" for a long time achieve revolutionary great unity. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Shenyang Garrison extensively carried out family visits and heart-to-heart talks, doing in-depth and detailed ideological and political work. They visited one family and propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to one family; they talked to one person and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions to one person. During the New Year holiday alone, they visited more than 12,000 households. The cadres and soldiers of a certain regiment of the Guangzhou Garrison have fully utilized their experience in grasping living thoughts, enthusiastically helped revolutionary mass organizations implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making 93% of the factories where this regiment is stationed achieve revolutionary great unity, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. The support-left troops in the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan learned from the love-the-people tradition of the former Red Army, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions with their mouths and did good deeds for the people with their hands. They also sent a large number of cadres and soldiers to assist revolutionary mass organizations in setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary masses praised them as: "Propagandists of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fighters in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, servants for the people, and good students of the revolutionary masses."

In the love-the-people activities, various troops have also universally seriously checked the implementation of the "love-the-people agreement," and on this basis, they have enriched and revised the "love-the-people agreement," striving to raise the level of love-the-people work to a new height. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team supporting the left in the Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory recently checked the implementation of the "support-the-army and love-the-people agreement" jointly formulated with the factory revolutionary committee and the responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations last August, deepening the deep affection between the military and the people. They unanimously decided to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the first item of the new "support-the-army and love-the-people agreement." In the process of checking the implementation of the "love-the-people agreement," the Tianjin Garrison reviewed the achievements and experiences of implementing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks over the past year, deeply feeling that every victory is the result of the military and civilians jointly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They are determined to, with the spirit of "seizing the day," further fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the new year. The frontline troops in Fujian and the troops in Qinghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Zhejiang, and Ningxia have also, through sending "love-the-people agreements," holding discussions, and joint celebrations, extensively solicited the opinions of the masses, checked discipline among the masses, found shortcomings, and quickly corrected them, further strengthening military-civilian relations.

    北京、上海、天津、山东、黑龙江、湖南、甘肃、杭州、青岛等省、市的革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组，最近一个时期分别召开大会或作出决定、发出通知，要求无产阶级革命派和革命群众在新年、春节期间更加广泛、深入地开展拥军活动，坚决相信和依靠解放军，拥护和热爱解放军，学习解放军，积极协助解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作，加强军民团结，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。黑龙江、青海、湖南、湖北、河北、江西、贵州等地，一月份以来热火朝天地展开了拥军活动。黑龙江省各级革命委员会集中一大批活学活用毛主席著作积极分子和拥军模范，带着《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章，手捧毛主席画像，到边防哨所和部队驻地去慰问解放军，并且同解放军交流活学活用毛主席著作的经验。青海省各族人民组成慰问团，从一月十二日起先后分赴全省各地，慰问人民解放军和烈属、军属、复员军人。一月二十日，青海西宁地区的革命群众和人民解放军在一起举行了拥军爱民大会，全省各州、县也都相继开展了“拥军爱民月”活动。湖南省湘潭地区在元旦前夕召开了两万人的拥军爱民大会，一月初又陆续召开多次军民联欢晚会，把学习解放军的活动推向了高潮。伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——韶山的广大贫下中农，邀请解放军同志到生产队或自己家里介绍活学活用毛主席著作的经验。河北省张家口地区的各机关、工厂、学校和人民公社，普遍掀起了向英雄四排和李文忠同志学习的热潮。天津市延安中学各个班都订了“拥军公约”，每个人都订了学习解放军的计划，有的班以“你向解放军学到了什么”为题举行座谈会，有的班邀请解放军帮助自己整风，全校的拥军活动搞得热火朝天。
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众在拥军活动中，召开各种形式的座谈会和报告会，用自己亲身经历的事实，热烈赞颂中国人民解放军一年多来在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的丰功伟绩。他们更加深刻地体会到伟大领袖毛主席所教导的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。河北省石家庄地区的无产阶级革命派说，驻石家庄的人民解放军坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有力地支持无产阶级革命派，夺取了石家庄地区无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。他们表示，一定更好地向解放军学习，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。内蒙古、贵州等地的无产阶级革命派热情赞扬解放军帮助他们开办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示。贵阳煤矿在解放军帮助下，从去年六月到现在共举办了四十多期毛泽东思想学习班，有百分之八十的职工轮流在学习班学习。革命职工通过斗私批修，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众在拥军活动中，掀起了学习解放军的热潮。他们认为，学习解放军，最根本的一条，就是要象解放军那样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，努力活学活用毛主席著作，学好用好毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实、全面落实。山西省革命委员会副主任、大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵说，我们学习解放军，就要象解放军那样对毛主席赤胆忠心，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身；要象解放军那样，执行毛主席的指示一丝一毫不走样，紧跟毛主席的战略部署一分一秒不离开，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在我们大寨、在全山西、全中国高高飘扬，永远飘扬。武汉市无产阶级革命派和革命群众在向解放军学习中，决心象解放军那样，做一个永远忠于毛泽东思想的革命战士。北京针织总厂的革命职工，向驻厂八三四一部队支左人员学习，坚持天天读毛主席的书，处处照毛主席的指示办事。现在，他们已经根据毛主席的最新指示，订出了一九六八年全年战斗规划。贵阳棉纺厂布机丙班的革命工人把解放军的四个第一和三八作风落实到基层，进一步增强了职工队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，有力地推动了革命和生产。
    据新华社二十日讯　中国人民解放军陆海空三军各部队积极贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，新年以来进一步广泛展开了爱民活动。
    中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种和北京、上海、天津、济南、武汉、兰州、沈阳、广州、南京、福州、成都、昆明等部队领导机关，以及新疆、西藏军区，分别向所属部队发出了关于新年春节期间开展爱民活动的通知，要求各部队广大指战员，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，发扬我军爱民的优良传统，立即掀起一个广泛、深入、热烈的爱民热潮，大力加强军民团结，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献自己最大的力量。工程兵、铁道兵、装甲兵、防化学兵和北京卫戍区等领导机关，分别举行了爱民动员大会。这些单位的负责人分别参加了大会，并且在会上讲了话。
    在爱民活动中，各部队都把在基层扎扎实实宣传、落实毛主席最新指示作为中心内容。成千上万的干部战士，分别组成毛泽东思想宣传队，奔赴工厂、农村、学校、街道，大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席的最新指示，让毛主席的最新指示同广大革命群众直接见面，在革命群众心里扎根，化为实际行动。北京部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队，七天内邀请二十个县的毛泽东思想学习班的学员和二十九个工厂、学校和生产大队的代表，参加部队举行的宣传毛主席最新指示的爱民晚会，大大促进了这些单位的革命大联合和革命三结合。上海、天津、广州、成都等地部队派出的毛泽东思想宣传队，活跃在城市、农村、山寨、海岛，宣传和落实毛主席最新指示，使毛主席最新指示家喻户晓，深入人心。刘英俊生前所在部队派出的毛泽东思想宣传队，在六个县、三个市的郊区和二十三个人民公社宣传、落实毛主席最新指示以后，使一些长期打“内战”的群众组织实现了革命大联合。沈阳市驻军毛泽东思想宣传队广泛开展家庭访问谈心活动，做深入、细致的思想政治工作。他们走一家，就把毛主席最新指示宣传到一家；谈一人，就把毛主席最新指示落实到一人，仅新年假日期间，就访问了一万二千多户。广州部队某团指战员，充分运用他们抓活思想的经验，满腔热情地帮助革命群众组织落实毛主席的最新指示，使这个团驻在的工厂有百分之九十三实现了革命大联合，革命、生产形势越来越好。在革命摇篮井冈山支左的部队，学习当年红军的爱民传统，人人动口宣传毛主席最新指示，人人动手为群众做好事，并且派出大批指战员协助革命群众组织办好毛泽东思想学习班。革命群众赞扬他们是：“毛主席最新指示的宣传员，斗私批修的战斗员，为人民服务的勤务员，革命群众的好学员。”
    在爱民活动中，各部队还普遍认真检查“爱民公约”的执行情况，在检查的基础上充实修订了“爱民公约”，努力把爱民工作提高到新的水平。在上海矽钢片厂支左的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，最近和工厂革命委员会、革命群众组织负责人一起检查了去年八月共同制订的“拥军爱民公约”的执行情况，增进了军民之间深厚的鱼水情谊。他们一致决定，把全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，作为新的“拥军爱民公约”第一条。天津部队在检查“爱民公约”落实情况的过程中，回顾了一年来执行“三支”“两军”任务所取得的成绩和经验，深深体会到，每一个胜利都是军民共同落实毛主席最新指示的结果，决心在新的一年里，以“只争朝夕”的精神，进一步条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。福建前线部队和青海、山西、黑龙江、吉林、浙江、宁夏等地部队，还通过送“爱民公约”，开座谈会、联欢会等活动，广泛征求群众意见，检查群众纪律，发现缺点，迅速改正，进一步密切了军民关系。
