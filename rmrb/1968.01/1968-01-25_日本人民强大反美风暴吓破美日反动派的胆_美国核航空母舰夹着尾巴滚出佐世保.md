The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" of the United States, which intruded into the Japanese port of Sasebo on the 19th, left Sasebo one day earlier than originally scheduled on the morning of the 23rd, heading towards the waters off Vietnam after stirring up a fierce anti-American patriotic struggle among the Japanese people.

The patriotic students of Sasebo, who had been fighting for many days, continued their spirited march near the U.S. naval base on the 23rd, angrily protesting the entry of the "Enterprise" into Sasebo. At the same time, several hundred workers and citizens held a protest rally near the port. Many workers stood on the hill overlooking the bay and shouted at the departing "Enterprise": "Get out of here, 'Enterprise'!" "Yankees, go back to your own country!"

Over the past week or so, the Japanese people have been waging fierce struggles almost every day, resolutely opposing the entry of the "Enterprise" into Japanese ports. The Japanese bourgeois news agency Kyodo could not help but admit that the scale and intensity of this struggle far surpassed the previous nineteen struggles against the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines into Japanese ports.

On the 22nd, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Sato government, Kimura Toshio, spoke to the press and could not hide his panic over the anti-American patriotic storm among the Japanese people. He helplessly stated that if U.S. nuclear ships enter Japanese ports again in the future, "we must carefully consider the feelings of the people."

The more the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese Sato government collude to turn Japanese territory into a U.S. nuclear war base, the more they will certainly face even more intense resistance from the broad masses of the Japanese people.

    日本人民强大反美风暴吓破美日反动派的胆
    美国核航空母舰夹着尾巴滚出佐世保
    新华社二十三日讯  东京消息：十九日闯入日本佐世保港口的美国核航空母舰“企业号”，在激起了日本人民猛烈的反美爱国斗争的风暴之后，二十三日早上比原订计划提前一天驶离佐世保，开往越南海域。
    坚持了许多天斗争的佐世保爱国学生，二十三日继续斗志昂扬地在美国海军基地附近举行游行，愤怒地抗议“企业号”开进佐世保。同时，几百名工人和市民在港口附近举行抗议集会。许多工人站在俯视海湾的山头上，对着正在开走的“企业号”振臂高呼：“‘企业号’滚回去！”“美国佬滚回老家去！”
    在过去大约一个星期内，日本人民几乎每天都开展了激烈的斗争，坚决反对“企业号”开进日本港口。日本资产阶级通讯社共同社也不得不承认，这场斗争的规模和激烈程度远远超过了过去十九次反对美国核潜艇开入日本港口的斗争。
    佐藤政府的官房长官木村俊夫二十二日向新闻记者发表谈话时，无法掩盖他对日本人民的这场反美爱国风暴流露出来的惊慌心情。他无可奈何地表示，以后美国核舰只如果再开进日本港口，“必须慎重地考虑国民的感情”。
    美帝国主义和日本佐藤卖国政府越是加紧勾结，把日本的土地变为美国的核战争基地，那就肯定要遭到广大日本人民更加激烈的反抗。（附图片）
