The red sun, the sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world! Shaoshan, the place where the red sun rises!

In recent years, many foreign proletarian revolutionary fighters and anti-imperialist warriors have visited Shaoshan with hearts full of boundless reverence and happiness, crossing mountains and rivers. They have written moving poems, singing of the place where the red sun rises, singing of Chairman Mao, singing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

A friend from the Dominican Republic wrote in his poem about Shaoshan: With a reverent heart, I came to Shaoshan; the cradle of supreme glory, the golden sun rises from here, I never dreamed I could have this rare opportunity in my lifetime. Shaoshan—the hometown of the supreme commander, will forever be etched in my heart. Nowhere in the world can compare to this happy village. I came here to sing aloud, the glorious teacher, the great leader, the genius of the world's people, the sun that illuminates the future. Your brilliant thoughts guide us towards dawn. The flames of armed struggle are blazing in all directions. My burning heart has a thousand words unsaid. I shout with joy, long live Chairman Mao, may you live as long as the pines!

A performer from the Syrian Al-Omari Folk Art Troupe wrote in his poem praising Shaoshan: The dawn rises on the horizon of my country, bringing light from the East! I rush towards it, shouting aloud: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" This is a new day. I have crossed the deep night, traversed mountains and rivers, quenched my thirst with river water, bathed in the sea, and rushed towards the East! I have seen the glorious sunlight! Mao Zedong—he is the golden sun! The West is still in deep darkness, shine brightly, golden sun!

    红太阳颂
    毛主席，中国人民和世界革命人民心中的红太阳！韶山，红太阳升起的地方！
    近几年来，许许多多外国无产阶级革命战士和反帝战士，怀着无限崇敬、无限幸福的心情，越千山，跨万水，访问了韶山。他们写下了一篇篇动人的诗歌，歌唱红太阳升起的地方，尽情歌颂毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    多米尼加一位朋友在歌唱韶山的诗中写道：怀着崇敬的心呀，我来到了韶山；无上光荣的摇篮呀，金色的太阳从这里升起，做梦也没想到能见到你呀，这毕生难得的良机。韶山——最高统帅的家乡，将永远铭记在我的心怀。天下哪儿也比不上，这个幸福的村庄。我来到这儿放声歌唱，光荣的导师、伟大的领袖，世界人民的天才，照耀前程的太阳。您光辉的思想呀，引导我们走向黎明。武装斗争的烈火，正在燃遍四面八方。我炽热的心呀，千言万语写不尽。纵情欢呼毛主席，万年青松寿无疆！
    叙利亚奥玛雅民间艺术团的一位演员在歌颂韶山的诗中写道：朝霞升起在我国地平线上，她带来了远东的光明！我向她奔去，我放声高呼：“毛主席万岁！
  毛主席万岁！”这是新的一天。我穿过深沉的黑夜，跋山涉水，引河水解渴，用海水洗澡，奔向东方！我看见了光辉的阳光！毛泽东——就是金色的太阳！西方还处在深沉的黑夜，高照吧，金色的太阳！
