Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit. This issue must be resolved."

The revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Municipal Water Supply Company, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, have earnestly studied, resolutely implemented, and strictly followed Chairman Mao's instructions. They correctly handle cadres, boldly and freely use revolutionary leading cadres, and fully play the role of revolutionary leading cadres as backbones, achieving good results in solving cadre problems.

How can cadre issues be resolved? The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, in helping the revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Municipal Water Supply Company liberate cadres, realized that to do a good job with cadres, Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be studied well, implemented well, and carried out well. Should "three old" cadres be liberated, or "three high" cadres?

In liberating cadres, the Beijing Municipal Water Supply Company encountered many active thoughts. For example, some advocated first liberating the old and sick, some advocated first liberating those who were always "observers" in past political movements, and some advocated first liberating those over sixty years old. People called these "three old" cadres. Why advocate first liberating "three old" cadres? The team members conducted in-depth and detailed investigation and research and found that, on the one hand, "three old" cadres did not implement the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and had no antagonistic feelings with the revolutionary masses, so there was no need to worry about revenge or wearing small shoes. On the other hand, "three old" cadres, due to their poor health, old age, weak abilities, and low prestige, even if liberated and participating in the revolutionary three-in-one combination, there was no need to worry about "losing power." The team members believed that this active thought was actually the "self" at work. In response to this active thought, they organized the revolutionary cadres to earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and organized everyone to fiercely struggle against the "self" in their minds. Thus, everyone became clear that: which cadres to absorb into the three-in-one combination is a key issue in doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit and is a key issue in establishing a temporary power organ with proletarian authority. Therefore, cadres who hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, have higher political awareness of the proletariat, and have higher revolutionary enthusiasm (people call these "three high" cadres) should be liberated first so that they can quickly be absorbed into the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership team.

Former Deputy Secretary of the Company Party Committee Supervision Committee Liu Mengcheng comrade, due to not understanding the Cultural Revolution, once implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes. However, Liu Mengcheng comrade joined the Red Army at the age of sixteen, went through the Long March of 25,000 li, and in decades of revolutionary struggle, always did good deeds and made contributions to the people. How should such a cadre be correctly handled? From the big picture, he is loyal to Chairman Mao and is a good comrade. However, he also has shortcomings and errors. After this thought was unified, Liu Mengcheng comrade was quickly liberated.

Revolutionary cadres stand out to be a supporting role, or to be a backbone?

The Beijing Municipal Water Supply Company established a revolutionary committee with a three-in-one combination on December 2, 1967. However, in the internal division of labor of the three-in-one combination leadership organization, some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations did not dare to boldly use the revolutionary leading cadres who stood out. For example, Liu Mengcheng comrade could have taken on more responsibilities, but they thought he could not. Originally, some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations, on the one hand, had a one-sided understanding of Liu Mengcheng, holding onto his mistake of implementing the bourgeois reactionary line and thinking he could not be the second-in-command. On the other hand, some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations only wanted him to stand out as a supporting role and did not want him to stand out as a backbone, saying things like "if he is the backbone, the revolution since the February seizure of power would have been in vain," and "the power has been returned to the original owner," and so on. In response to this issue, the team members organized the proletarian revolutionary cadres to earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on solving cadre issues, his sayings on cadre issues, and the glorious tradition of the Yan'an Rectification Movement. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We ask for fewer mistakes. If mistakes are made, then we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the better." After studying, the proletarian revolutionary cadres further clarified: they should allow cadres to make mistakes and even more should allow cadres to correct mistakes, and should not have such an atmosphere where a cadre seems to not be allowed to make any mistakes, and once a mistake is made, they are never allowed to rise again. After studying Chairman Mao's sayings on the two-line struggle within the party, the proletarian revolutionary cadres understood: if a cadre makes a mistake and does not criticize and educate them, that is wrong, that would be making a rightist mistake; but if a cadre makes a mistake and corrects it, and does not welcome and encourage them, and does not acknowledge that changing is good, that is also wrong, that would be making a "leftist" mistake. Therefore, everyone unanimously agreed that Liu Mengcheng comrade should take on the work of the first deputy director of the revolutionary committee.

Using revolutionary cadres is to be hesitant, or to be bold and decisive?

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Municipal Water Supply Company, the proletarian revolutionary cadres boldly and decisively let Liu Mengcheng comrade go to work, wholeheartedly helping him play a backbone role in his work position. However, at the beginning, the proletarian revolutionary cadres were afraid that Liu Mengcheng comrade would say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, which would directly affect the prestige of the revolutionary committee, so they were always a bit uneasy about the work teams he directly led and the work he independently handled, and were hesitant in their use of him. In response to this situation, the team members organized the proletarian revolutionary cadres to earnestly study Chairman Mao's teachings on cultivating and using cadres, and organized discussions: is it to use cadres hesitantly, or to use cadres boldly and decisively? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Cadres and peasants will transform themselves through their own struggle experience. Let them do, and in doing, they will gain lessons and increase their abilities. In this way, a large number of outstanding figures will emerge. A fearful attitude of fearing dragons in front and tigers behind cannot cultivate cadres." After studying, the proletarian revolutionary cadres' minds were enlightened, and they believed that it was wrong not to help when revolutionary cadres make mistakes; it was also wrong not to be bold and decisive in using revolutionary cadres. In a sense, only by boldly and decisively using them is the greatest help to revolutionary cadres; only by boldly and decisively using them can cadres be thoroughly liberated. Thus, the proletarian revolutionary cadres boldly and decisively let Liu Mengcheng comrade go to the front line of the struggle to promote revolution and production, let him handle various key and complex issues, and wholeheartedly gave support and help in the actual work process. Liu Mengcheng comrade also maintained close contact with the revolutionary masses, lived, worked, and labored with the masses, and fought against selfishness and revisionism with the revolutionary masses. After a period of actual struggle, the team members deeply felt that: only by helping the proletarian revolutionary cadres boldly and decisively use cadres, and letting revolutionary cadres play a key role in key positions, can revolutionary cadres be thoroughly liberated.

### 落实毛主席最新指示，做好干部工作

    落实毛主席最新指示，做好干部工作
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”
    北京市自来水公司无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真学习，坚决贯彻，不折不扣地落实毛主席这一指示，他们正确地对待干部，大胆放手地使用革命领导干部，充分发挥革命领导干部的骨干作用，取得了解决干部问题的好经验。
    干部问题怎样才能解决好呢？北京卫戍区某部驻北京市自来水公司毛泽东思想宣传队，在帮助这个公司的无产阶级革命派解放干部中体会到：要做好干部的工作，一定要把毛主席的最新指示学习好、贯彻好、落实好。解放“三老”干部，还是解放“三高”干部？
    北京市自来水公司在解放干部中，碰到过不少活思想，如有的主张首先解放老病号，有的主张首先解放在历次政治运动中都是“观察员”的老好人，也有的主张首先解放六十高龄的老年人。人们管这叫“三老”干部。为什么主张首先解放“三老”干部呢？宣传队的同志们作了深入细致的调查研究工作，原来是：一方面，“三老”干部在无产阶级文化大革命运动中没有执行过资产阶级反动路线，和革命群众没有什么对立情绪，不必担心报复、穿小鞋；另一方面，“三老”干部由于身体差、年纪大、能力弱、威信低，即使解放出来参加了革命的三结合，也不必担心“大权旁落”。宣传队的同志们认为：这个活思想，实际上是“私”字在作怪。针对这个活思想，他们认真组织无产阶级革命派学习毛主席的最新指示，组织大家狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。从而使大家明确了：吸收什么样的干部参加三结合，是搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，是建立具有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构的关键问题。所以，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得比较高、突出无产阶级政治的觉悟比较高、革命干劲比较高的革命干部（人们管这叫“三高”干部），更应该首先解放出来，以便更快地吸收他们参加革命三结合的领导班子。
    前公司党委监委副书记刘孟成同志，由于对文化大革命不理解，曾经一度执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误。但是，刘孟成同志十六岁当红军，经过二万五千里长征，在几十年的革命斗争中，总是做过好事，为人民立过功的。如何正确对待这样的干部呢？从大节上看，他是忠于毛主席的，是一个好同志。但是，他又是有缺点、错误的。这个思想统一以后，刘孟成同志就很快地被解放出来了。
  革命干部站出来当陪衬，还是做骨干？
    自来水公司于去年十二月二日建立了三结合的革命委员会。但是，在三结合领导机构的内部分工上，革命群众组织的一些负责人，对站出来的革命领导干部不敢大胆使用。如刘孟成同志本来可以担负更多的责任，他们却认为不行。原来革命群众组织的一些负责人，一方面是对刘孟成的认识上有片面性，抓住他执行过资产阶级反动路线的错误不放，就认为他不能当第二把手。另一方面是革命群众组织的一些负责人，只想叫他站出来当陪衬，不想叫他站出来作骨干，说什么“他当骨干，二月夺权至今的革命就白干了”，说什么“大权归还原主了”，等等。针对这个问题，宣传队的同志组织无产阶级革命派认真学习毛主席关于解决干部问题的最新指示、关于干部问题的语录和延安整风的光荣传统。毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”经过学习，无产阶级革命派进一步明确了：应该允许干部犯错误，更应该允许干部改正错误，不要有这样的空气，一个干部似乎犯不得一点错误，一犯了错误，就从此不得翻身。在学习毛主席关于党内两条路线斗争的有关语录后，无产阶级革命派懂得：干部犯了错误，不去批判他、教育他，那是不对的，那就将犯右的错误；但是，干部犯了错误已经改正，不去欢迎他、鼓励他，不承认改了就好，那也是不对的，那就将犯“左”的错误。因此大家一致赞同刘孟成同志担任革命委员会第一副主任的工作。
  使用革命干部是束手束脚，还是大胆放手？
    北京市自来水公司革命委员会成立后，无产阶级革命派就大胆放手地让刘孟成同志去工作，满腔热情地帮助他在工作岗位上发挥骨干作用。但在开始时，无产阶级革命派恐怕刘孟成同志说错话、办错事，会直接影响革命委员会的威望，因此，对刘孟成同志直接领导的一些工作小组，以及他独立处理的一些工作，总有点不放心，在使用中束手束脚。针对这种情况，宣传队的同志组织无产阶级革命派认真学习毛主席关于培养干部、使用干部的教导，并组织讨论：是束手束脚地使用干部，还是大胆放手地使用干部？毛主席教导我们说：“干部和农民在自己的斗争经验中将改造他们自己。要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生。前怕龙后怕虎的态度不能造就干部。”经过学习，无产阶级革命派的思想豁然开朗，他们认为，在革命干部办错事时该帮不帮，是错误的；对革命干部使用上该放手不放手，也是错误的。在某种意义上说，只有大胆放手地使用，才是对革命干部最大的帮，只有大胆放手地使用，才能使干部彻底的解放。于是，无产阶级革命派大胆放手地让刘孟成同志到斗争的第一线去抓革命、促生产，让他去处理各种关键性的复杂问题，在实际工作过程中，满腔热情地给予支持和帮助。刘孟成同志也和革命群众保持着密切的联系，和群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，工作在一起，和革命群众一起斗私批修。经过一段时间的实际斗争，毛泽东思想宣传队的同志深深体会到：只有帮助无产阶级革命派大胆放手地使用干部，让革命干部在关键性的岗位上发挥关键性的作用，才是彻底解放了革命干部。
