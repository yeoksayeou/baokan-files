Title: The Enemy Exploits Factionalism, Factionalism Shields the Enemy

The enemy exploits factionalism, factionalism shields the enemy.

Currently, factionalism has become a major obstacle to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the enemy at our doorstep, we must resolutely crush it!

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an expanded form of individualism, a "poisonous gas" emanating from the kingdom of the bourgeois worldview. It is fundamentally opposed to the principles of proletarian party spirit.

Factionalism is a venomous snake that poisons people's souls, corrupts their revolutionary will, and seriously harms our revolutionary comrades and revolutionary cause. When this venomous snake wraps around a person, it will strangle, bite, and poison them to death. Factionalism is a good helper for the class enemy, acting as a guerrilla unit for a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

When you occupy a position and engage in factional struggles, the class enemy has already completed the task of "reconnoitering the direction," opening a gap, or seizing the opportunity to infiltrate the masses' organizations to personally command, or hiding behind the scenes to manipulate, causing deep rifts between the two factions. When you are blinded by personal and factional interests, desperately vying for "positions" and "core status," the class enemy immediately comes out to flatter you, elevating you to the heavens, making you dizzy and confused, unable to distinguish between friends and enemies. You see comrades with differing views as thorns in your side, while viewing cunning enemies who disguise themselves as revolutionaries and pander to your whims as "steadfast revolutionaries." When you momentarily confuse the two types of contradictions, ready to curse or even punch and brandish weapons at class brothers, the class enemy immediately emerges. They either personally take command, pushing you to the forefront of armed struggles, or provide strategies and cheers, firmly supporting your "100% revolutionary actions." In dark corners, they incite "fighting over a shrimp while the fisherman benefits." Thus, "internal wars" continue, and armed struggles never cease. When you waver or doubt the decisions, instructions, and orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, the enemy's black hands have already sneaked in. They spread rumors, shoot dark arrows, and stir up your discontent and emotions, using an ultra-leftist facade to influence you, luring you onto the dangerous path of directly opposing the proletarian headquarters....

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is thus intertwined with the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and class enemies inside and outside the party to undermine the Cultural Revolution.

However, some of our comrades do not see the problem this way. They lack the class struggle line in their minds, fail to see the reactionary nature of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and do not understand the principle that the enemy exploits factionalism and factionalism shields the enemy. We ask these comrades to look back at the history of "internal wars" in some regions and observe the reality of the ongoing "internal wars" between the two revolutionary organizations in some regions. Are these not the evil consequences of the enemy exploiting factionalism and factionalism shielding the enemy? The lessons of the past should be a warning.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "How do counter-revolutionaries use two-faced tactics? How do they deceive us with false appearances while secretly doing things we do not expect? All these things are unknown to tens of thousands of good people. It is precisely because of this that many counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated our ranks. Our people's eyes are not sharp, and we are not good at distinguishing between good and bad people. We are good at distinguishing between good and bad people in normal situations, but we are not good at distinguishing between certain people in special situations." Those who are still entangled by the venomous snake of factionalism should wake up.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a sharp and complex class struggle. We must not let factionalism blind our eyes, mistaking enemies for comrades and comrades for enemies. True proletarian revolutionaries must serve the interests of the proletariat, the interests of socialism, and the interests of more than 90% of the revolutionary people. We must not serve the interests of a small group or faction. We must arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen proletarian party spirit, enhance class struggle awareness, keep our eyes sharp, and maintain high revolutionary vigilance. We must unite and fight the enemy together. Thus, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and various ghosts and snakes will have nowhere to hide.

The New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily pointed out: "Can one consciously overcome factionalism? This is an important sign of whether one is willing to be a true proletarian revolutionary in the new situation." Are we to be true proletarian revolutionaries who uphold proletarian party spirit, or are we to be mediocre people led by the nose by bourgeois factionalism? This is a very serious and important question facing every revolutionary comrade, and it is also a severe test for each of us. Every revolutionary comrade must seriously consider and answer with actual actions.

Down with factionalism! Cut off the black hands! Proletarian revolutionaries, unite!

    敌人利用派性　派性掩护敌人
    ——论打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性
    《新安徽报》一月十七日社论
    敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人。
    目前，派性已成为我们全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌。大敌当前，必须坚决把它打倒！
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是扩大了的个人主义，是从资产阶级世界观王国里冒出来的“毒瓦斯”。它同无产阶级的党性原则，是根本对立的。
    派性是毒蛇，它毒害人们的灵魂，腐蚀人们的革命意志，严重危害着我们的革命同志和革命事业。派性这条毒蛇缠在人身上，就会把人缠死、咬死、毒死。派性这条毒蛇，是阶级敌人的好帮手，起了党内一小撮走资派的别动队的作用。
    当你占据山头，大搞派别斗争的时候，阶级敌人已完成“窥测方向”的任务，打开了一道缺口，或者趁机钻进群众组织亲自指挥，或者隐身幕后进行操纵，大搞分裂，使两派组织的裂痕越来越深。当你被私利、派利迷住心窍，拚命力争“席位”、“核心”的时候，阶级敌人马上出来恭维，把你捧上天，使你昏昏然，茫茫然，人妖颠倒，认敌为友，视友为敌，把观点不同的同志看成眼中钉、肉中刺，而把那些伪装革命、迎合己意的狡猾敌人视为“坚定的革命派”。当你一时混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，对阶级兄弟将要动口咒骂，以至挥起拳头，耍弄刀枪的时候，阶级敌人立刻冒了出来，他或者亲自出马，发号施令，把你推上武斗的第一线；或者为你出谋划策，呐喊助威，坚决支持你“百分之百的革命行动”，在阴暗的角落里，煽动“鹬蚌相争”，坐收渔人之利。于是“内战”连绵，武斗不息。当你对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的决定、指示、号令，发生动摇或怀疑的时候，敌人的黑手已悄悄地伸了进来，他们造谣言，放暗箭，竭力挑动你的不满，煽动你的情绪，以极“左”的面目来影响你，诱使你走上直接对抗无产阶级司令部的危险道路。……
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就是这样同党内一小撮走资派、同党内外的阶级敌人破坏文化大革命的阴谋活动交织在一起。
    然而，我们有的同志并不是这样地看问题，他们头脑里缺少阶级斗争这条纲，看不清资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动性，不懂得敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人这个道理。我们请这些同志翻一翻某些地区的“内战”史，再看一看某些地区两派革命组织延续至今的“内战”现实，这些难道不都是敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人所造成的恶果吗？前车之鉴，足以为训。
    毛主席指出：“反革命分子怎样耍两面派手法呢？他们怎样以假象欺骗我们，而在暗里却干着我们意料不到的事情呢？这一切，成千成万的善良人是不知道的。就是因为这个原故，许多反革命分子钻进我们的队伍中来了。我们的人眼睛不亮，不善于辨别好人和坏人。我们善于辨别在正常情况之下从事活动的好人和坏人，但是我们不善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。”至今仍被派性这条毒蛇缠身的人，应该猛醒了。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，我们切不可再被派性蒙住自己的眼睛，把敌人当成同志，把同志当成敌人。真正的无产阶级革命派，要为无产阶级的利益服务，为社会主义的利益服务，为占人口百分之九十以上的广大革命人民的利益服务，决不能只为某一小团体、小宗派的利益服务。我们必须用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，加强无产阶级党性，增强阶级斗争观念，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把革命警惕性提得高高的，团结一致，共同对敌。这样，党内一小撮走资派和各种牛鬼蛇神，就无处藏身了。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论指出：“能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。”究竟是做坚持无产阶级党性的真正的无产阶级革命派，还是做被资产阶级派性牵着鼻子走的庸人？这是摆在每个革命同志面前的一个十分严肃的重大问题，也是对我们每个革命同志的一次严峻考验，一切革命同志都必须认真思考和以实际行动作出回答。
    打倒派性！斩断黑手！无产阶级革命派联合起来！
