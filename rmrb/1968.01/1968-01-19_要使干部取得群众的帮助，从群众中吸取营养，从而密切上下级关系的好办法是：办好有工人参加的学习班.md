Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army should hold study classes with soldiers participating." This is a major measure to solve the problem of cadres through education at present, and it is also the direction for future cadre education. Currently, revolutionary comrades on all fronts are following the principle of Chairman Mao's instructions, striving to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The three materials published here on holding study classes in factories, mines, and rural areas fully illustrate that as long as study classes are held according to this principle and actively absorb workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to participate, they can better promote the thought reform of cadres, and can enhance the mutual understanding between cadres and the masses. The relationship between cadres and the masses has undergone a new change. Cadres and masses who participate in such study classes all say: In the past, cadres were floating above, and the relationship with the masses was an "oil and water" relationship. After studying, the class feelings between cadres and the masses have been greatly deepened, turning into a "fish and water" relationship. —Editor

To gain the support of the masses, draw nourishment from the masses, and thereby strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates, a good way is:

To hold study classes with workers' participation

With the help of military representatives stationed in the factory, Qingdao Red Flag Chemical Factory has held sixty-four study classes so far, and all new and old cadres and more than ninety percent of the workers in the factory have participated in the study.

The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "The army should hold study classes with soldiers participating" has been received, and all revolutionary workers in the factory are thrilled.

The military representatives stationed in the factory and the revolutionary committee of the factory, in order to make all revolutionary workers deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the masses to link up with reality and talk extensively about their own gains from participating in the study classes. After coming forward, the original branch secretary of the workshop, Sun Yitang, was still burdened with the thought that workers might not trust him. He participated in the study class with the workers, exposed his thoughts together, fought against selfishness, and saw with his own eyes the spirit of the workers who dared to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the "self" in their minds. He was deeply moved and boldly exposed his wrong thoughts, receiving the enthusiastic help of the workers. He said with deep feelings: "The gains I have made from studying with the workers these days are greater than working in the factory for more than ten years."

Many comrades also talked about how, since participating in the study classes, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly strengthened, and the whole factory has shown a good political atmosphere of mutual encouragement in ideology, mutual help in learning, mutual cooperation in work, and mutual care in life. The original secretary of the factory party committee, He Baolong, said: "In the past, the relationship between myself and the workers was not a 'fish and water' relationship, but an 'oil and water' relationship. I was floating above, and I was not in harmony with the masses. This time, studying and working with the workers has greatly deepened the class feelings."

Many young workers said that after studying with revolutionary cadres and old workers, they learned a lot of good ideas, good styles, and good traditions.

Before October last year, the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought held in this factory were all off-duty studies. Due to the limitations of objective conditions, the number of participants was small and far from meeting the eager demand of the broad masses of workers to study Chairman Mao's works. Later, the whole factory set up mass Mao Zedong Thought part-time study classes. These part-time study classes are based on production teams and administrative departments, with leading cadres participating, with young workers as the backbone, with revolutionary cadres of the proletariat as the core, and voluntarily organized by the masses. Because the workshops, teams, departments, and dormitories all set up study classes, study classes blossomed everywhere, and everywhere became a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice.

Through the summary of the masses, everyone enthusiastically talked about the superiority of relying on the masses to hold study classes. This study class has both the unified leadership of the revolutionary committee and can mobilize the masses of workers to participate. Everyone is both a teacher and a student. Whoever studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought the best and most actively should take the lead in guiding. Through study, the relationship between cadres and the masses is constantly improved. Everyone thinks: To hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes with workers' participation, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of the masses running the classes and democratic management. Only in this way can the study classes be run more effectively and achieve new levels.

    毛主席教导我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加”。这是当前从教育着手解决干部问题的重大措施，也是今后干部教育的方向。目前，各条战线的革命同志们，都在遵照毛主席教导的这个原则，努力办好毛泽东思想学习班。
    这里发表的有关工矿和农村办学习班的三个材料充分说明，凡是按照这个原则办学习班，积极吸收工人和贫下中农参加的，就能更好地促进干部思想革命化，就能增进干部和群众的互相了解，干部和群众的关系就起了新的变化。参加这种学习班的干部和群众都说：过去，干部浮在上面，和群众是“油水关系”；经过学习，大大加深了干部和群众之间的阶级感情，转变为鱼水关系。　——编者
    要使干部取得群众的帮助，从群众中吸取营养，从而密切上下级关系的好办法是：
    办好有工人参加的学习班
    青岛红旗化工厂在驻厂军代表的帮助下，到现在已经办了六十四个学习班，全厂新老干部和百分之九十以上的工人都参加了学习。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于
  “军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示传来，全厂革命职工欢欣鼓舞。
    驻厂军代表和厂革委会，为了使广大革命职工，深刻领会毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，发动群众联系实际，大谈自己参加学习班的甜头。原车间支部书记孙义堂站出来以后，怕工人不信任，思想上仍有包袱。他和工人一起参加学习班，一起亮思想，斗私心，亲眼看到了工人那种敢于同自己头脑中的“私”字刺刀见红的精神，深受感动，大胆暴露了自己的错误思想，得到工人热情的帮助。他深有感触地说：“这些日子我同工人一起学习的收获，胜过在厂工作十几年。”
    许多同志还谈到，自从参加学习班以来，干群关系大大密切了，全厂出现了思想上互相鼓励，学习上互相帮助，工作上互相协作，生活上互相体贴的良好政治气氛。原厂党总支书记郝宝隆说：“过去自己同工人的关系不是‘鱼水关系’，而是‘油水关系’，自己浮在上面，和群众格格不入。这次同工人一起学习，一起劳动，大大加深了阶级感情。”
    许多青年工人说，他们同革命干部和老工人一起学习后，学到了不少好思想、好作风、好传统。
    去年十月份以前，这个厂办的毛泽东思想学习班，都是脱产学习。因为受客观条件限制，参加的人数少，远远不能满足广大职工渴望学习毛主席著作的要求。以后，全厂办起了群众性的毛泽东思想业余学习班。这种业余学习班，是以生产班组和行政科室为基础，有领导干部参加，以青年职工为骨干，以无产阶级革命派为核心，由群众自愿结合组成的。由于车间办，班组办，科室办，宿舍办，学习班遍地开花，处处都是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。
    通过群众性的总结，大家畅谈了依靠群众办学习班的优越性。这种学习班既有革委会的统一领导，又能发动广大工人参加，大家既是教员，又是学员。谁毛泽东思想学得最好，用得最活，谁就担任辅导。通过学习，不断改善了干群之间的关系。大家认为：要办好有工人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，必须坚持群众办学，民主办学的方针。这样才能把学习班办得更有成效，办出新水平。
