The two revolutionary mass organizations in Longfeng County, Anhui Province, had been engaged in prolonged "internal warfare," resulting in mutual distrust and suspicion, with factionalism running rampant. Even after organizational unity was achieved, ideological barriers remained deep. Some comrades persistently quarreled over trivial issues, insisting on resolving past disagreements to determine who was right or wrong. Some said, "The unity is a unity without principles, it's just muddling through," "There is no foundation for this unity." Some people changed their minds just a few days after the unity. Disputes and debates over trivial matters occurred frequently, seriously affecting the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great alliance. With the help of the local supporting army, the comrades from both factions followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution." They established Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the county, making the eradication of factionalism a key task. Using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as "arrows," they aimed at various forms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction launched a "people's war" to eradicate factionalism. They extensively exposed the manifestations, dangers, and crimes of factionalism, consciously fighting it fiercely. For example, a teacher who had previously been strongly factional once mistook a stranger for a "good cadre" and another revolutionary comrade from the opposing faction as an "enemy." He even forced his own child to withdraw from the opposing organization due to differing views. In the study class, he regretfully said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest.' Yet, factionalism made me mistake enemies for friends and comrades for enemies." Some comrades who had suffered from factionalism said, "Looking at the situation with factionalism, the more you look, the more confused you get; listening to news with factionalism, the more you listen, the more 'private' interests you hear; speaking with factionalism, the more you speak, the less united you become; propagating with factionalism, the more you propagate, the more it harms the revolution. The result is that you are busy fighting 'internal wars,' forgetting the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle."

How can factionalism be overcome? One must follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Each side should make more self-criticism." Under the guidance of the PLA comrades, they repeatedly studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recognizing that whether one is willing to make self-criticism, expose factionalism, fight factionalism, and change factionalism, indicates whether one is a genuine proletarian revolutionary. They set high standards for themselves, daring to expose factionalism without fear of embarrassment, fighting it without fear of pain, and changing it without fear of difficulty. Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest," regretting that they had not listened to Chairman Mao's words, had not directed the struggle against the real enemies, but against class brothers, deviating from the grand direction of the struggle, and disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Both sides, armed with the sharp weapon of "each side making more self-criticism," effectively struck down factionalism, eliminated barriers, and strengthened unity.

    打倒派性，团结对敌
    ——记长丰县学习班围剿派性的斗争
    安徽省长丰县两派革命群众组织，由于长期打“内战”，彼此互不信任，互相猜疑，派性十足。组织上联合起来以后，思想上的隔阂仍然很深。有的同志在一些枝节问题上老是纠缠不休，总想把原来分歧的问题，辩个谁是谁非，搞个“水落石出”。有的说：“联合是无原则的联合，是和稀泥”，“联合没有基础”。有的人在联合后，没几天又变了卦。一些枝节上的争执、辩论，接二连三，不断发生，严重影响了革命大联合的巩固和发展。在当地支左部队的帮助下，两派的同志遵循毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导，在全县范围内开办了毛泽东思想学习班，把围剿派性作为一项重要内容，用毛主席最新指示之“矢”，射形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性之“的”。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，广大无产阶级革命派，发动了一场围歼派性的“人民战争”。他们大摆派性的表现，大揭派性的危害，大列派性的罪状，自觉地斗，狠狠地斗。例如有一个教师过去因为派性很强，分不清敌我，曾把素不相识的坏人当成了“好干部”；却把另一派革命同志当作“敌人”，甚至对自己的孩子，也因观点不同而势不两立，硬逼着孩子退出对方组织。在学习班上，他很后悔地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。’可是，派性害得我把敌人当成朋友，把亲人当作了敌人。”有些吃过派性苦头的同志说：“带着派性看形势，越看越糊涂；带着派性听消息，越听‘私’字越多；带着派性讲话，越讲越不团结；带着派性搞宣传，越搞越对革命不利。其结果是忙于打‘内战’，忘记了革命斗争的大方向。”
    怎样才能克服派性？必须遵照毛主席的教导：“各自多做自我批评”。他们在解放军同志的帮助下，反复地活学活用毛主席最新指示，认识到愿不愿做自我批评，亮不亮派性，斗不斗派性，改不改派性，标志着自己是不是一个真正的无产阶级革命派。他们用高标准要求自己，做到亮派性不怕丑，斗派性不怕痛，改派性不怕难。大家一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的教导，后悔自己没有听毛主席他老人家的话，没有把斗争的矛头指向真正的敌人，而是指向了阶级兄弟，背离了斗争的大方向，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署。双方由于掌握了“各自多做自我批评”这个锐利的武器，有力地打击了派性，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。
