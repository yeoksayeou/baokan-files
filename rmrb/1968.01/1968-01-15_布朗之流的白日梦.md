Recently, British Foreign Secretary George Brown visited Tokyo, using the so-called "Anglo-Japanese regular consultations" as an opportunity to curry favor with Japanese reactionary leaders like Sato. This British imperialist shamelessly flattered Japanese militarism, saying things like "you have responsibilities beyond your own coastlines," "the world is looking to you," and "we hope Japan will take the lead." His sycophantic attitude is truly nauseating.

A foreign minister of the once-great British Empire, groveling so shamelessly before Japanese reactionaries—why? The reason is clear. British imperialism is currently in an unprecedentedly difficult situation, barely able to get by. The British colonial system has collapsed, domestic political and economic crises are severe, and the pound has been devalued. Withdrawing troops from overseas is inevitable. To maintain its remaining colonial influence in Asia, the British ruling class has had to turn to Japanese militarism for help. Brown's obsequious behavior towards Japanese reactionaries fully exposes the pathetic state of British imperialism.

Brown even had the audacity to say in Tokyo that "without Japan, there is no Asia; without Britain, there is no Europe." This is sheer nonsense! Japanese militarism was long ago defeated by the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia. Even with the support of American imperialism, it is at best a lackey of American imperialism in Asia. The peoples of Asia do not even bother to look at American imperialism, let alone its minions?

As for Brown's boasting about Britain, it is even more ridiculous. In its heyday, the British Empire was at its peak, boasting of being the "empire on which the sun never sets." But those days are gone. After World War II, the British Empire has become a has-been. If a few years ago it was like a dying centipede, today its days are numbered. It has no foothold in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and its position in Europe is also pitiful. It desperately wants to join the European Common Market but has been repeatedly rebuffed. The recent pound crisis has made British imperialism the laughing stock of the capitalist world. Japanese bourgeois newspapers openly mock today's Britain as a "burden on the free world," saying its incurable disease "will become the biggest cancer in the free world." Yet Brown dares to puff out his chest in Japan, providing only more laughs for the world.

Brown's personal visit to Tokyo to court Japanese reactionaries is obviously an attempt to revive the old dream of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, to join forces against the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia. At the beginning of the 20th century, Britain and Japan, these two pirate nations, formed an alliance to vie for hegemony in Asia and made a killing. But today, the era of imperialist powers dominating Asia is gone forever. British imperialism and Japanese militarism, one a has-been, the other a nouveau riche, joining forces will not amount to much and cannot change the course of Asian history.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They are not as powerful as they seem. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the same, we must not underestimate them." British imperialism is just like this. Although it is on its last legs, it is still struggling desperately, hoping to use the strength of Japanese militarism to prolong its miserable existence. British imperialism can only live on illusions.

Today, who owns Asia? Socialist China, with its 700 million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stands tall on the Asian continent. The Japanese people are more awake than ever. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning fiercely across Asia. Asia belongs to the peoples of Asia, and the fate of Asia is in the hands of the Asian peoples. Whether it is American imperialism, British imperialism, Japanese militarism, or various demons and monsters, they will all be swept away by the great tide of the Asian people's revolution!

    布朗之流的白日梦
    本报评论员
    最近，英国外交大臣布朗跑了一趟东京，利用所谓“英日定期协商”的机会，同日本反动派的头目佐藤等人大套交情，加紧勾搭。这个英帝国主义分子大肆吹捧日本军国主义什么“负有超过你们自己的海岸线的责任”呀，什么“世界现在瞩目于你们”呀，什么“希望日本起领导作用”呀，媚态十足，实在令人作呕。
    堂堂一个大英帝国的外交大臣，这样不嫌肉麻地大拍日本反动派的马屁，这究竟是为什么呢？事情很明白，英帝国主义目前的处境空前困难，日子简直混不下去了。英帝国的殖民体系已经土崩瓦解，国内政治经济危机深重，英镑被迫宣布贬值，从海外撤军势在必行。为了维持它在亚洲残存的殖民势力，英国统治集团不得不求助于日本军国主义。布朗对日本反动派竭尽阿谀逢迎之能事，活现出英帝国主义的寒酸相。
    布朗在东京居然还大言不惭地胡说什么“没有日本，就没有亚洲；没有英国，就没有欧洲。”这真是活见鬼！日本军国主义是早就被中国人民和亚洲人民打败了的。现在，尽管它在美帝国主义的扶植下复活起来，但是，充其量不过是美帝国主义在亚洲的一个仆从。美帝国主义尚且不被亚洲人民放在眼里，何况是它的爪牙呢？
    至于布朗对英国的自吹自擂，则更加荒唐可笑。想当年，大英帝国盛极一时，号称“日不落之国”。但是，好景不再，第二次世界大战以后，英帝国已经成了一个破落户。如果说前些年它还有如一只死而不僵的百足之虫，那末，今天它的日子已经屈指可数了。它不仅在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲无法立足，甚至在欧洲的地位也十分可怜。它死乞白赖地想要挤进西欧“共同市场”，也连吃闭门羹。最近英镑危机的爆发，使英帝国主义这个破落户在资本主义世界受尽奚落。日本的资产阶级报纸，也公开嘲笑今天的英国是“自由阵营的累赘”，说它的不治之症
  “将变成自由世界最大的癌症”。而布朗竟然在日本打肿脸充胖子，这只能给全世界提供新的笑柄而已。
    布朗这次亲自到东京去拉拢日本反动派，显然是想要重温英日同盟的旧梦，合伙对付中国人民和亚洲人民。二十世纪初，英国和日本这两个海盗国家结成联盟，争夺在亚洲的霸权，曾经捞过一把。但是，今天，帝国主义列强称霸亚洲的时代已经一去不复返了。英帝国主义和日本军国主义，一个破落户，一个暴发户，两家勾结在一起，也决成不了什么气候，改变不了亚洲历史的进程。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过，一切反动势力“是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。”英帝国主义也正是这样。它虽然已经气息奄奄，人命危浅，但是仍在作垂死挣扎，妄想借助日本军国主义的力量来苟延残喘。英帝国主义只能靠幻想过日子了。
    今日的亚洲，竟是谁家天下？毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民的社会主义中国屹立在亚洲大陆之上。日本人民空前觉醒。亚洲各国人民的革命武装斗争的烈火正在熊熊燃烧。亚洲是亚洲人民的亚洲，亚洲的命运掌握在亚洲人民的手里。不管是美帝国主义、英帝国主义、日本军国主义，以及形形色色的妖魔鬼怪，通通都必将被亚洲人民革命的伟大洪流所淹没！
