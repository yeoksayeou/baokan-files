Great Mao Zedong Thought is the basis for the unity of the proletarian party – thoroughly criticize the reactionary “absolute unity” theory of China’s Khrushchev

China’s Khrushchev is a cunning conspirator aiming to usurp the party. For a long time, he has consistently opposed Chairman Mao’s proletarian line of party building, pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line of party building, attempting to make the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party undergo a “peaceful evolution.” To achieve this conspiracy, he has fabricated various fallacies, one of which is the “absolute unity” theory. In his “On the Cultivation of Party Members in Organization and Discipline,” he said: “Maintaining the unity of the party is absolute,” and even if there are “differences in principles,” one must “obey even if it is wrong.” He has also consistently advocated: “Whether the party’s line is correct or erroneous, the party must remain united.” Does China’s Khrushchev truly care about the unity of the party? Absolutely not. He advocates this “blind obedience” and “absolute unity” to deceive and suppress party members and the masses, making them his “tame tools” for his anti-party and usurpation schemes. This fallacy is part of his entire conspiracy to usurp the party and restore capitalism, and it must be thoroughly refuted.

Organizational principles must serve the political line

The unity and solidarity of the proletarian revolutionary party are the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolution.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: “We must build a centralized and united party,” and “we must unite all the strength of our party under the principles of democratic centralism and discipline, and build a strong unity.”

Marxists have always believed that unity is strength, that the unity and solidarity of the party are the lifeblood of the party, the magic weapon for defeating enemies and achieving victory, and the reliable guarantee for the proletariat to seize and consolidate political power. Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and our great leader Chairman Mao have all made great contributions in theory and practice to the unity and solidarity of the proletarian revolutionary party, setting a brilliant example.

However, what kind of unity and what kind of solidarity? On this issue, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are fundamentally opposed to various opportunism and revisionism.

Lenin said: “We highly value the unity of the party. However, we value even more the purity of the principles of the revolutionary Social Democratic Party.”

The unity that the proletariat needs is revolutionary unity, unity for the great cause of communism. The proletarian party can only unite to make revolution, unite to struggle for the communist cause to the end; it cannot unite to surrender to the enemy, unite to restore capitalism. This is what Lenin called the purity of principles. That is to say, organizational principles must serve the political line. The proletarian party must establish a solid unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism principles, and establish a strong unity under the correct line of Marxism-Leninism.

The highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, is the basis for the unity and solidarity of the proletarian party. The history of the Chinese revolution has proven that our party can only achieve the true unity and solidarity needed by the proletariat to fulfill its historical mission on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, in the unity and solidarity under Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

China’s Khrushchev, in stark contrast to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, maliciously proposed the “absolute unity” theory. He said: “Maintaining the party’s unity is absolute.” In his view, the correctness of the party’s guiding ideology and political line can be set aside. He openly proposed: Even if there are “differences in principles” and “errors in politics,” one must “unconditionally and absolutely obey” and “maintain the party’s unity.” Obviously, the unity that China’s Khrushchev wants is a unity that sacrifices revolutionary principles, a unity that betrays the revolution, a unity that turns the proletarian party into a bourgeois party.

The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and opportunism, revisionism, is a life-and-death class struggle, either the East Wind prevails over the West Wind or the West Wind prevails over the East Wind, with no room for compromise. Under the political line of opportunism and revisionism, to advocate “absolute unity” and “absolute obedience” is to make the proletariat surrender to the bourgeoisie, to make the proletariat abandon Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and “absolutely obey” opportunism and revisionism. Is there any other explanation?

For decades, China’s Khrushchev has pushed a line of capitulationism and revisionism, which has clearly annotated his advocacy of “absolute unity.”

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he advocated that even if there were “differences in principles,” “maintaining the party’s unity is absolute,” he also vigorously advocated taking the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek as the “revolutionary banner,” advocating “unity under the leadership of the central government,” advocating that the Communist Party-led anti-Japanese armed forces be led by Chiang Kai-shek’s “National Government.” After the victory of the War of Resistance, he again advocated the so-called “peaceful democratic new stage,” advocating the sale of the Communist Party and the people’s armed forces led by the party. Obviously, if our party “absolutely obeys” this line of capitulationism, and “absolutely unites” under this line, would our party not have long ago become a subsidiary party of the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek, a fascist party, a traitorous and sellout party?

During the socialist revolution, he advocated the development of the rich peasant economy, advocated that capitalists “exploit with merit,” advocated “consolidating the new democratic order,” and even encouraged capitalists to “struggle against workers.” After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, he again vigorously advocated the “theory of the extinction of class struggle,” saying that one should “emphasize the oneness” with the bourgeoisie and “admit capitalists into the party.” If our party “absolutely obeys” this revisionist line and “absolutely unites” under this line, would our party not have long ago become a revisionist party, a bourgeois party?

From this, it is clear that China’s Khrushchev’s advocacy of “absolute unity whether the party’s line is correct or erroneous” is to lead our party astray, to change the nature of our party, to make our party become a bourgeois party.

Only through the correct struggle within the party can true unity be achieved

The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie inevitably reflects within our party. The emergence of various differences and contradictions within our party, and even differences in lines, is nothing strange.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe,” “the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitional, and therefore relative, while the struggle of opposites is absolute.” The unity and struggle of the party are the unity of opposites, they are mutually complementary. The unity and solidarity of the proletarian party are established and consolidated precisely in the process of continuous struggle. Without struggle, there is no unity.

China’s Khrushchev’s advocacy of the “absolute unity” theory fundamentally denies the contradictions in things, abolishes the struggle between opposites, and completely betrays revolutionary dialectics and Mao Zedong Thought. He one-sidedly advocates unity without struggle, saying that one should “emphasize oneness, not struggle,” and even if there are “differences in principles and ideology,” one must “absolutely unite.” He, from the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie, has for decades extolled the decadent philosophy of “being good to others” and “repaying evil with kindness,” and the “national character” of “liking to be lenient,” vigorously advocating “party peace.” He wants to abolish the struggle within the party, especially the struggle between the two lines, under the false banner of “unity,” and strangle the life of the party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the party, the life of the party will also stop.” The philosophy of the Communist Party is the philosophy of struggle, the philosophy of revolution. The proletarian party can only raise the banner of revolutionary struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought to defeat bourgeois ideology, use Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line to smash the opportunist line, purify its ranks, continuously develop and strengthen its ranks, and forever maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and vitality. Otherwise, the fighting Communist Party will become stagnant, will degenerate and change in quality.

The “being good to others” that China’s Khrushchev talks about is to make us, together with the reactionary clique of Chiang Kai-shek, the landlords and capitalists, and the opportunist elements Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and the traitorous clique he has vigorously shielded, talk about “oneness” and not allow struggle with them. The “repaying evil with kindness” he talks about is to make the proletariat feel grateful to the class enemies who exploit and oppress us, thanking them for their “merits in exploitation.” The “liking to be lenient” he talks about is to make us “coexist peacefully” with opportunism, kneel and surrender to the class enemy.

It is clear that the “absolute unity” and “party peace” he wants is to allow erroneous thoughts and erroneous lines to freely spread within the party, not allowing us to criticize and struggle. In fact, he is not really against the struggle within the party; he only allows the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat and does not allow the proletariat to counterattack.

It is clear that only by adhering to revolutionary principles, adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can one achieve the true unity of the proletarian revolutionary party. Abandoning principles and advocating unity with opportunism and revisionism is not the unity of the proletariat, but as Lenin said, “it means the unity of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie of one’s own country, it means the split of the international proletariat, it means the unity of the running dogs and the split of the revolutionaries.”

Advocating unity with the bourgeoisie and revisionists necessarily means splitting with Marxists-Leninists. Isn’t this the case? Who has, for a long time, been hypocritical, insincere, saying nice things to the face but scheming behind the back, playing the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick, opposing Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line? Who has secretly formed factions, recruited traitors, stealthily gathered a counter-revolutionary force, and set up a bourgeois command center? And who has been secretly colluding with the Soviet Khrushchev, with a tacit understanding, responding to each other, attempting to carry out a “peaceful evolution” of China? The history of more than forty years of the party completely proves that China’s Khrushchev, who has gathered all opportunism, is the greatest and longest-hidden revisionist and splitist within the Chinese Communist Party.

It should be seriously noted that after the Soviet Khrushchev overthrew the proletarian dictatorship, the reactionary clamor of China’s Khrushchev’s “absolute unity” theory has become more brazen and rampant. He screams hoarsely that every party member must be an “easily controlled” “tame tool.” He even openly clamors, “If there is a Khrushchev coup in the Chinese party,” “even if the majority opinion is wrong, one must ‘the minority obeys the majority.’” The plot is revealed, and China’s Khrushchev has shown his ferocious face. If his conspiracy succeeds, China will see the restoration of capitalism, human history will see a great retrogression, and millions of revolutionary people will lose their heads!

The reactionary “absolute unity” theory harbors a very sinister conspiracy of China’s Khrushchev. In this big poisonous weed of “On the Cultivation of Party Members in Organization and Discipline,” he shamelessly compares himself with the great revolutionary teachers Marx and Lenin, placing himself among the three examples of leadership models. He, who is clearly a great traitor to the cause of the working class, disguises himself as a “party-building authority,” “leader of the entire party,” and “leadership model,” truly the most shameless! China’s Khrushchev is a great conspirator and opportunist, a thief of the party.

Under the banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, unite

Our party, over the decades, has been under the wise leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao, adhering to the correct struggle within the party, continuously correcting and overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts within the party, especially conducting uncompromising struggles against the right and “left” opportunist lines, and has united and strengthened itself on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

However, China’s Khrushchev, in order to peddle the “absolute unity” theory, has wantonly distorted the history of the party. At a time when the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique had already usurped the leadership of the party and the state, and modern revisionism had already emerged in the international communist movement, China’s Khrushchev, in a conversation with a representative of a certain country’s Communist Party, actually said:

“Even during the period of Chen Duxiu’s erroneous line, our entire party was united under Chen Duxiu’s line, and later united under the ‘left’ line… This is the experience of the Chinese party, which you can refer to. That is to say, whether the party’s line is correct or erroneous, the party must remain united.”

What an experience! This is a monstrous lie, a vicious slander and attack on our great leader Chairman Mao and our great party. The history of our party is a glorious history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and all opportunist lines, a history that no one can falsify. The unity and solidarity of the Chinese Communist Party on the basis of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line victory is something that no one can distort.

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in 1938: “In the past seventeen years, our party has generally learned to use the weapon of ideological struggle in Marxism-Leninism, opposing erroneous thoughts within the party from two aspects, opposing right opportunism on one hand and ‘left’ opportunism on the other.” In the history of the development of the Chinese Communist Party, it is full of struggles between the two lines. The history of the Chinese Communist Party is also the history of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines.

When did our party ever unite under the erroneous line of Chen Duxiu? When did our party ever unite under the “left” line?

No! Never! On the contrary, even when Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and others usurped the leadership of the party, within our party, the correct line represented by Chairman Mao was always struggling fiercely with Chen Duxiu’s right opportunist line and the “left” opportunist lines of Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and others. Great Leader Chairman Mao mercilessly criticized and smashed the “left” and right opportunism, opening up the brilliant road of the Chinese revolution. The Zunyi Conference of great historical significance announced the great victory of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. The entire party united under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, united on the basis of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and advanced victoriously in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

It is precisely because our party has united under the banner of great Mao Zedong Thought that our party is great, glorious, and correct.

However, China’s Khrushchev said that our party’s “experience” is that “whether the party’s line is correct or erroneous, the party must remain united.” For a party that has already appeared with a revisionist line, he introduced such an “experience” to them, asking them to “refer” to it. Isn’t this blatantly asking them to “absolutely unite” with the revisionist line? Isn’t this attacking Marxism-Leninism and protecting revisionism?

China’s Khrushchev’s advocacy of the fallacy of “whether the party’s line is correct or erroneous, the party must remain united” not only distorts the history of the Chinese Communist Party but also distorts the history of the international communist movement. The history of the international communist movement also shows that only on the basis of Marxism-Leninism theory and under the correct political line can the international communist movement truly unite and solidify. Lenin said: “We stand completely on the basis of Marxist theory,” “because only this theory can unite all socialists.”

In the era of Marx and Engels, they struggled with the Bakuninists, Proudhonists, Blanquists, Lassalleans, and other opportunist factions on the basis of principles, uniting the world’s proletarian revolutionaries on the basis of Marxism.

In the era of Lenin and Stalin, they struggled with the Bernstein and Kautsky of the Second International, the Mensheviks, Trotsky, Bukharin, and others on the basis of principles, uniting the world’s proletarian revolutionaries on the basis of Leninism.

The contemporary world has entered a great turning point. At this critical moment of the great showdown between the international proletariat and the bourgeoisie, modern revisionism, represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, has shamefully betrayed Marxism-Leninism, causing an unprecedented serious split in the international communist movement. The great historical task of thoroughly smashing modern revisionism and establishing a new unity and solidarity in the international communist movement has been placed before all revolutionary people of the world.

In the contemporary world, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism, the great banner of our era. All proletarian revolutionaries of the world must unite and solidify on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought to undertake the great historical tasks.

Currently, a great movement to study Mao Zedong Thought on an unprecedented scale is unfolding around the world. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the revolutionary practice of the people of all countries in the world, will be grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and will release a great revolutionary force. The fighting unity of the international communist movement under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is forming with irresistible force in the great struggle.

The great call of “Workers of the world, unite!” is resounding with an even higher pitch in the skies of the 20th century. History will realize the scientific prediction of Great Leader Chairman Mao: “All Marxists-Leninists of the world unite, all revolutionary people of the world unite, defeat imperialism, defeat modern revisionism, defeat the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system, will definitely be established.”

* * *

A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists represented by China’s Khrushchev, attempting to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, split and usurp our party, is truly “a small ant trying to shake a big tree, laughable and self-deluded.” In this great proletarian cultural revolution, the reactionary line of China’s Khrushchev has been thoroughly bankrupt, and the bourgeois command center has been thoroughly smashed. Our urgent task now is to thoroughly criticize China’s Khrushchev’s revisionism in party building and other aspects, eliminate its poison, and make our party more united, more solid, and more consolidated on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The entire history of our party shows: To ensure the unity and solidarity of the party, one must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, opposes Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, is our sworn enemy, and we will definitely exterminate him with the entire party and the entire nation!

    伟大的毛泽东思想是无产阶级政党统一的基础
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反动的“绝对统一”论
    装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派
    中国赫鲁晓夫是个阴谋篡党的大野心家。长期以来，他一贯对抗毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，推行一条反革命修正主义的建党路线，妄图使伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党“和平演变”。为了实现这个阴谋，他制造了种种谬论，其中有一条，叫做“绝对统一”论。他在《论党员在组织上和纪律上的修养》中说：“保持党的统一是绝对的”，即使有了“原则上的不同”，“不对也要服从”。他还一直宣扬：“无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一”。难道是中国赫鲁晓夫真正关心党的团结和统一吗？绝对不是。他提倡这样“盲目服从”的“绝对统一”，是妄图以此蒙蔽和压服党员群众，做他反党篡党的“驯服工具”。这套谬论，是他整个反党篡党阴谋的组成部分，是为他复辟资本主义的整个阴谋服务的，必须痛加驳斥。
        组织原则必须服从政治路线
    无产阶级革命政党的团结和统一，是无产阶级革命事业取得胜利的根本保证。
    伟大领袖毛主席历来教导我们：“我们一定要建设一个集中的统一的党”，“要把我们党的一切力量在民主集中制的组织和纪律的原则之下，坚强地团结起来。”
    马克思主义者从来认为，团结就是力量，党的团结和统一是党的生命，是战胜敌人和夺取胜利的法宝，是无产阶级夺取政权、巩固政权的可靠保证。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和我们伟大领袖毛主席都在理论上和实践上为无产阶级革命党的团结和统一，作出了巨大的贡献，树立了光辉的榜样。
    但是，要什么样的统一，要什么样的团结？在这个问题上，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同形形色色的机会主义、修正主义是根本对立的。
    列宁说：“我们非常珍视党的团结。但是我们更为珍视革命社会民主党的原则的纯洁性。”
    无产阶级所需要的统一，是革命的统一，是为共产主义伟大事业而斗争的统一。无产阶级的党，只能统一起来干革命，统一起来为共产主义事业奋斗到底；不能统一起来去投降敌人，统一起来去复辟资本主义，这就是列宁说的原则的纯洁性。这就是说，组织原则必须服从政治路线。无产阶级政党必须在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上，建立巩固的统一，在马克思列宁主义的正确路线下，建立坚强的统一。
    当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义、战无不胜的毛泽东思想是无产阶级政党团结和统一的基础。中国革命的历史雄辩地证明，我们的党，只有在毛泽东思想基础上的团结和统一，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上的团结和统一，才是无产阶级为完成自己的历史使命所需要的真正的团结，真正的统一。
    中国赫鲁晓夫同马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想背道而驰，别有用心地提出什么“绝对统一”论。他说：“保持党的统一是绝对的”。在他看来，党的指导思想和政治路线正确与否，却可以抛在一边。他公然提出：即使“原则路线上”发生了“分歧”，即使“政治上错了”，也要“无条件的、绝对的服从”，“保持党的统一”。很显然，中国赫鲁晓夫所要的统一，是牺牲革命原则的统一，叛变革命的统一，使无产阶级政党蜕化为资产阶级政党的统一。
    无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同机会主义、修正主义的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，没有任何调和的余地。在机会主义、修正主义的政治路线之下，来搞什么“绝对统一”，“绝对服从”，那就是要无产阶级向资产阶级投降，就是要无产阶级放弃马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，“绝对服从”于机会主义、修正主义。除此以外，难道还有别的解释吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫几十年来推行的一条投降主义、修正主义路线，为他所鼓吹的“绝对统一”作了最清楚不过的注脚。
    抗日战争时期，在他鼓吹即使有“原则路线上”的“分歧”，“保持党的统一是绝对的”的时候，他又大肆鼓吹要以蒋介石国民党为“革命的旗帜”，要“团结在中央政府的领导之下”，要共产党领导的抗日武装受蒋介石的“国民政府”领导。到抗战胜利以后，他又鼓吹什么“和平民主新阶段”，要把共产党和党领导的人民武装统统出卖掉。很明显，如果我们的党“绝对服从”他这条投降主义路线，在这条路线下“绝对统一”的话，我们的党岂不早就变成了蒋介石国民党的附庸党，变成了法西斯的党，变成了汉奸、卖国贼的党了吗？
    社会主义革命时期，他要发展富农经济，鼓吹资本家“剥削有功”，主张“巩固新民主主义秩序”，甚至鼓励“资本家向工人斗争”。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，他又大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，说什么对资产阶级要“强调同一性”，要将资本家“接收入党”。如果我们的党“绝对服从”他这条修正主义路线，在这条路线下“绝对统一”的话，我们的党岂不早就变成了修正主义的党，变成了资产阶级的党了吗？
    由此可见，中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“无论党的路线正确或错误”的“绝对统一”，乃是要将我们党引向歧途，是要篡改我们党的性质，要使我们党变为资产阶级的党。
        只有开展正确的党内斗争，
          才能达到真正的统一
    无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争，不可避免地要反映到我们党内来。在我们党内，出现这样那样的分歧和矛盾，甚至出现路线的分歧，是毫不奇怪的。
    毛主席教导我们：“对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律”，“对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、过渡的，因而是相对的，对立的斗争则是绝对的”。党的统一和斗争，是对立的统一，是相反相成的。无产阶级政党的统一和团结，正是在不断斗争的过程中建立和巩固起来的。没有斗争就没有统一。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“绝对统一”论，根本否认事物的矛盾，取消对立面的斗争，彻头彻尾地背叛了革命辩证法，背叛了毛泽东思想。他片面鼓吹只要统一，不要斗争，说什么“强调同一性，不是强调斗争性”，即使是“原则路线上、思想上的分歧”，也要
  “绝对统一”。他从反动的资产阶级立场出发，几十年来百般吹嘘“善与人同”、“以德报怨”的腐朽哲学和
  “喜欢宽大”的“民族性”，竭力鼓吹“党内和平”。他就是要在“统一”的虚伪口号下，取消党内斗争，特别是取消两条路线的斗争，扼杀党的生命。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”共产党的哲学就是斗争的哲学，革命的哲学。无产阶级政党只有高举革命斗争的旗帜，用毛泽东思想去战胜资产阶级思想，用毛主席的革命路线去粉碎机会主义路线，才能纯洁自己的队伍，才能不断发展、壮大自己的队伍，才能永远保持蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气和旺盛的生命力。否则，战斗的共产党就会变成死水一潭，就会蜕化变质。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“善与人同”，就是要我们和蒋介石反动派，和地主资本家，和机会主义分子陈独秀、王明以及他所竭力包庇下来的叛徒集团大讲“同一性”，不许和他们作斗争。他所说的“以德报怨”，就是要无产阶级对于剥削我们压迫我们的阶级敌人感恩戴德，感谢他们“剥削有功”。他所说的“喜欢宽大”，就是要我们同机会主义“和平共处”，向阶级敌人屈膝投降。
    可见，他所要的“绝对统一”、“党内和平”，就是只许错误思想、错误路线在党内自由泛滥，不许我们批判斗争。其实，他并不是真的不要党内斗争，他是只准资产阶级向无产阶级进攻，不许无产阶级向资产阶级反击。
    可见，只有坚持革命原则，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，才能达到无产阶级革命党的真正的统一。放弃原则，同机会主义、修正主义讲统一，那就决不是无产阶级的统一，而是象列宁所说的，“意味着无产阶级同本国资产阶级的统一，意味着国际无产阶级的分裂，意味着走狗的统一和革命者的分裂。”
    同资产阶级和修正主义者讲统一，必然是同马克思列宁主义者搞分裂。事实不正是这样吗？是谁长期以来，阳奉阴违，口是心非，当面说得好听，背后又在捣鬼，玩弄反革命两面派手法，对抗毛主席的革命路线？是谁在暗地里结党营私，招降纳叛，鬼鬼祟祟地拉起一套反革命人马，搞起一个资产阶级司令部？又是谁同苏联赫鲁晓夫眉来眼去，心心相印，遥相呼应，妄想对中国实行“和平演变”？四十多年党的历史完全证明，集一切机会主义大成的中国赫鲁晓夫，正是中国共产党内隐藏最深最久的最大的修正主义者，分裂主义者。
    应当引起严重注意的是，在苏联赫鲁晓夫颠覆了无产阶级政权之后，中国赫鲁晓夫的“绝对统一”论的反动叫嚣，变得越发露骨、越发猖狂了。他力竭声嘶地叫喊，每个党员都“要作容易驾驭的”“驯服工具”。他甚至公然叫嚣，“如果中国党内发生了赫鲁晓夫政变”、“多数意见是错误的，也要‘少数服从多数’”。图穷匕首见，中国赫鲁晓夫露出了他的狰狞面貌。如果他的阴谋得逞了，中国就会出现资本主义复辟，人类历史就会出现大倒退，千百万革命人民就会人头落地！
    反动的“绝对统一”论，包藏着中国赫鲁晓夫一个极其险恶的阴谋。就在《论党员在组织上和纪律上的修养》这株大毒草中，他竟然恬不知耻地把自己同伟大的革命导师马克思、列宁相提并论，把自己塞进了领导模范的三个例子中。他明明是叛卖工人阶级事业的大工贼，却自我装扮成“建党权威”、“全党领袖”、
  “领导模范”，真是无耻之尤！中国赫鲁晓夫是一个最大的阴谋家、野心家，是一个窃党大盗。
        在战无不胜的毛泽东思想
          的旗帜下统一起来
    我们的党，几十年来，就是在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，坚持正确的党内斗争，不断纠正和克服党内的各种非无产阶级思想，特别是对右的和“左”的机会主义路线进行毫不调和的斗争中才在毛泽东思想的基础上统一起来，并且得到不断地巩固、发展和壮大的。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫为了贩卖“绝对统一”论，竟然肆意歪曲党的历史。在苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团已经篡夺了党和国家的领导权，国际共产主义运动中已经出现了现代修正主义逆流的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫在和某国共产党代表团的一次谈话中，竟然胡说：
  “即使在陈独秀的错误路线时期，我们全党亦统一在陈独秀的路线之下，以后统一在‘左’倾路线之下……这是中国党的经验，可以做为你参考。就是说无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一。”
    好一个经验！这是一个弥天大谎，这是对我们伟大领袖毛主席、对我们伟大的党最恶毒的污蔑和攻击。我们党的历史，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同一切机会主义路线斗争的光辉历史，是任何人篡改不了的。中国共产党在毛主席革命路线胜利基础上的团结和统一，是谁也歪曲不了的。
    毛主席在一九三八年明确指出：“十七年来，我们的党，一般地已经学会了使用马克思列宁主义的思想斗争的武器，从两方面反对党内的错误思想，一方面反对右倾机会主义，又一方面反对‘左’倾机会主义。”在中国共产党的发展史中，充满了两条路线的斗争，中国共产党的历史也就是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争史。
    什么时候，我们党曾经统一在陈独秀的错误路线之下呢？什么时候，我们党曾经统一在“左”倾路线之下呢？
    没有！从来没有！恰恰相反，即使陈独秀、王明等人窃踞党的领导地位的时候，在我们党内，以毛主席为代表的正确路线一直同陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线，同李立三、王明等人的“左”倾机会主义路线进行着激烈的斗争。伟大领袖毛主席毫不留情地批判和粉碎了“左”右倾机会主义，开拓出中国革命的光辉道路。具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议，宣告了毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。全党在毛主席的英明领导下团结起来，在毛主席革命路线基础上统一起来，沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进。
    正因为我们的党是在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下统一起来的，所以我们的党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却说什么我们党的“经验”，是“无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一”。对于一个已经出现了修正主义路线的党，他向他们介绍这样一个“经验”，要他们“参考”，这不是明目张胆地要他们“绝对统一”于修正主义路线吗？这不是打击马克思列宁主义，保护修正主义，又是什么呢？
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一”的谬论，不仅歪曲了我们中国共产党的历史，而且也歪曲了国际共产主义运动的历史。国际共产主义运动的历史同样表明，只有在马克思列宁主义的理论基础上，在正确的政治路线下，国际共产主义运动才能真正团结和统一起来。列宁说过：“我们完全站在马克思理论的基础上”，“因为只有这样一个理论，才能把一切社会主义者团结起来”。
    马克思和恩格斯的时代，他们同巴枯宁派、普鲁东派、布朗基派、拉萨尔派等等机会主义派别，进行了原则性的斗争，把世界无产阶级革命派，在马克思主义的基础上，统一团结起来。
    列宁和斯大林的时代，他们同第二国际伯恩施坦、考茨基之流，同孟什维克、托洛茨基、布哈林之流，进行了原则性的斗争，把世界无产阶级革命派，在列宁主义的基础上，统一团结起来。
    当代世界已经进入一个伟大的转折点。在国际无产阶级和资产阶级大决战的关键时刻，以苏修领导集团为代表的现代修正主义，可耻地背叛了马克思列宁主义，造成了国际共产主义运动空前严重的大分裂。彻底粉碎现代修正主义，建立国际共产主义运动的新的统一和团结，这一空前伟大的历史任务，已经摆在全世界一切革命人民的面前了。
    在当代，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是我们时代的伟大旗帜。全世界的无产阶级革命派，都必须在毛泽东思想的基础上，才能真正统一起来，团结起来，担负起伟大的历史任务。
    目前，一个空前巨大规模的毛泽东思想学习运动，正在全世界展开。毛泽东思想和全世界各国人民的革命实践相结合，为亿万革命人民所掌握，就将爆发出巨大的革命力量。以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的国际共产主义运动的战斗团结，正以不可抗御的力量，在伟大的斗争中形成。
      “全世界无产者，联合起来”的伟大号召，正以更加高昂的音调，震响在二十世纪的世界上空。历史必将实现伟大领袖毛主席的科学预言：“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”

    以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，妄图对抗毛泽东思想，分裂和篡夺我们的党，真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线彻底破产了，资产阶级司令部被彻底摧毁了。我们现在的迫切任务是要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在党的建设方面和其他一切方面的修正主义，肃清它的流毒，使我们的党在毛泽东思想的基础上更加统一，更加团结，更加巩固。
    我们党的全部历史经验表明：保证党的团结和统一，就必须无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。谁要反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线，他就是我们不共戴天的敌人，我们就一定要全党共诛之，全国共讨之！
