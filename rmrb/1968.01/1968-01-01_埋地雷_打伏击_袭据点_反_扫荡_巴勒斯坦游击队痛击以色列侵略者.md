Palestinian guerrillas have been continuously attacking Israeli aggressors in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River.

According to a report in Cairo newspapers on the 30th, Palestinian guerrillas recently detonated landmines in the Han Yunis area northeast of the Gaza Strip, destroying an Israeli military vehicle. Another vehicle was destroyed in the same manner in the Hanun area to the southeast. Israeli soldiers in the vehicles were injured.

On the West Bank of the Jordan River, Palestinian guerrillas sabotaged a water pump station about two miles southeast of Nabi Oli. They also launched three attacks on Israeli forces in the Beit Shaan Valley.

According to reports from Cairo newspapers, Palestinian guerrillas recently launched simultaneous attacks on Israeli occupying forces in the Tabariya, Tulkarm, Jerusalem, and Jericho regions of the West Bank. Another guerrilla unit attacked an Israeli patrol in eastern Jerusalem.

According to reports from Cairo newspapers, not long ago, Israeli occupying forces, with the support of helicopters, launched a combined military operation against Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, and Jerusalem in the West Bank, attempting to suppress the growing strength of the guerrillas there. However, the Israeli occupying forces' attacks were met with fierce resistance.

    埋地雷　打伏击　袭据点　反“扫荡”
    巴勒斯坦游击队痛击以色列侵略者
    据新华社开罗三十日电　巴勒斯坦游击队在加沙地带和约旦河西岸连续袭击以色列侵略者。
    据开罗报纸三十日报道，巴勒斯坦游击队最近在加沙地带的汉尤尼斯东北用地雷炸毁了以色列一辆军车，并在哈农地带东南炸毁了另一辆。车上的以色列士兵受到伤亡。
    在约旦河西岸，巴勒斯坦游击队破坏了奈维奥东南约两英里的水泵站。他们还在贝特沙万山谷对以色列军发动了三次袭击。
    据开罗报纸消息，巴勒斯坦游击队最近同时向约旦河西岸的太比里亚斯、图尔卡姆、耶路撒冷和杰里科等地区的以色列占领军发动攻击。另一支游击队在耶路撒冷东部袭击了以色列的巡逻队。
    据开罗报纸报道，不久前，以色列占领军曾出动联合兵种部队，在直升飞机的掩护下，对约旦河西岸的纳布卢斯、杰宁、拉马拉和耶路撒冷进行了突击军事行动，妄图镇压那里日益增强的游击队的力量。但是以色列占领军的袭击遭到了猛烈的抵抗。
