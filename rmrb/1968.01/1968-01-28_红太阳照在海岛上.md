The red sun shines on the island.

The representative of the second session of the Air Force's active learners of Chairman Mao's works, the instructor of the "Red Vanguard Radar Station," Ma Ronggui.

We have longed for it every day and thought about it every day. The most blessed and unforgettable moment has finally arrived. On January 26, our dearest red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us.

When Chairman Mao, with his radiant face and vigorous demeanor, frequently waved his mighty hand that guides the world revolution, and strode energetically towards us, I shouted at the top of my lungs with all my might: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts illuminate the entire world and also shine brightly on our frontline island, nurturing the growth of the island's soldiers. Although we have been stationed on this small island far from the mainland for many years, the hearts of the island soldiers beat in unison with yours every moment. How many mornings have we greeted the rising red sun in the east and sung "The East Is Red"! How many nights have we gazed towards the place where you reside, sincerely wishing you eternal life! With the blue sky as paper and the vast sea as ink, we cannot write enough about the boundless love and loyalty of the island soldiers for you. With countless cheers and songs, the island soldiers' vow is just one sentence: Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our red hearts loyal to you will never change.

Over the past decade, you have received our radar station representatives seven times. This is your greatest care for us, the greatest happiness for the island soldiers. Each time you receive us, you bring us boundless strength. To ensure that your brilliant thoughts forever shine on the frontline island, our unit's representatives have brought back bags and packages of soil imbued with your brilliant thoughts from the place where the red sun rose—Shaoshan, from the first red base area—Pinggangshan, from the historically significant city of Zunyi, and from the cradle of the revolution—Yan'an. In 1966, our company commander went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. On the day he returned, before dawn, he got up, cupped a handful of soil from Zhongnanhai, carefully placed it in his bag, and brought it back to the island as the most precious gift. When the soldiers saw the soil from Zhongnanhai that the company commander brought back, they jumped for joy and shed tears of happiness. We scattered this precious soil, handful by handful, gently onto the small plots of land between the rocks. Everyone said: "The company commander brought soil from Chairman Mao's side, as if Chairman Mao had come to our small island."

Last year, during the commemoration of the first anniversary of your "May 7th Directive," we named several plots of land according to the source of the soil: "Shaoshan Field," "Jinggangshan Field," "Zunyi Field," "Yanan Field," "Nanhuaiwan Field," and "Zhongnanhai Field," as living teaching materials for the company's traditional education. Excellent soldier Xing Shengli, seeing the newly named plots of land, wrote a poem with great emotion:

	Shaoshan soil, a handful,
	On the island, the red sun rises;
	Pinggangshan soil, a handful,
	The revolutionary spark is spread on the island;
	Soil from the Long March,
	Chairman Mao's revolutionary line shines brightly;
	Soil from Baota Mountain,
	The revolutionary tradition is forever carried on;
	The soil from Zhongnanhai is extraordinary,
	Chairman Mao's voice reaches the island;
	Each handful of soil carries deep affection,
	Nurturing new sprouts to grow strong and healthy;
	With this soil on the island,
	We have a direction on the revolutionary path.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! No matter how many words we use, we cannot express the boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty of the island soldiers for you. Today, around the magnificent and grand People's Hall where you received us, I again cupped a handful of soil from your side. This soil from your side, I will bring it back to the island, as if bringing back your boundless warmth and immense care for the island soldiers.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! With sincere hearts, we pledge to you: We will definitely follow your teaching to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, defend our national defense, and defend the Cultural Revolution. We, the island soldiers, will forever stand on this red island imbued with your brilliant thoughts, stand guard for you for a lifetime.

    红太阳照在海岛上
    空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、“红色前哨雷达站”指导员  马荣贵
    天天盼，日日想，最最幸福、最最难忘的时刻终于来到了。一月二十六日，我们心中最红的红太阳，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们。
    当毛主席他老人家满面红光，神采奕奕，频频地挥动着他那指导世界革命的巨手，迈着矫健的步伐来到我们跟前的时候，我放大了喉咙，使出了全身的力气，高喊：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家的光辉思想，普照着全世界，也照红了我们前哨海岛，哺育着海岛战士的茁壮成长。我们虽然长年驻守在远离大陆的小岛上，然而，海岛战士的心，每时每刻都随着您老人家的脉搏一起跳动。有多少个早晨，我们迎着东方升起的红太阳，把《东方红》高唱！有多少个夜晚，我们遥望着您老人家居住的地方，衷心敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！蓝天做纸，大海做墨，写不尽我们海岛战士对您老人家的无限热爱，无限忠诚。千声欢呼，万声歌唱，海岛战士的誓言就是一句话：海可枯石可烂，忠于您老人家的红心永不变。
    十几年来，您老人家先后七次接见我们雷达站的代表。这是您老人家对我们最大最大的关怀，是我们海岛战士最大最大的幸福。您每一次接见，都给我们带来了无穷无尽的力量。为了让您老人家的光辉思想永远照耀在前哨海岛，我们连的代表先后从升起红太阳的地方——韶山，从第一块红色根据地——井冈山，从具有伟大历史意义的名城——遵义，从革命的摇篮——延安，带来了一袋袋一包包浸透着您老人家光辉思想的土。一九六六年，我们连长到北京参加国庆观礼。临回来的那天，天没亮，他就起床，双手捧起了一捧中南海的土，小心翼翼地装进挎包里，做为最最珍贵的礼物，带回到海岛上。战士们看到连长带回来的中南海的土，都高兴得跳了起来，激动得流下了幸福的热泪。我们把这一包珍贵的土，一把一把地轻轻撒在礁石缝间的小块地上。大家说：“连长带来了毛主席身边的土，就好象毛主席来到了我们小岛上。”
    去年五月，我们在纪念您老人家“五七”指示发布一周年的时候，按照土的来源，分别把几块菜地命名为“韶山田”，“井冈山田”，“遵义田”，“延安田”，“南泥湾田”，“中南海田”等，做为连队进行传统教育的活教材。五好战士邢胜利看到一块块新命名的菜地，激动地写了一首诗：
      “韶山冲里一把土，岛上升起红太阳；
    井冈山上一把土，革命火种播岛上；
    长征路上一把土，毛主席的革命路线放光芒；
    宝塔山上一把土，革命传统永发扬；
    中南海的土啊不寻常，毛主席的声音传岛上；
    把把泥土情意重，育出新苗茁又壮；
    岛上有了这些土，革命路上有方向。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语也说不尽我们海岛战士对您老人家的无限热爱，无限崇拜，无限信仰，无限忠诚。今天在您老人家接见我们的雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂周围，我又用双手捧起了一把土，这是您老人家身边的土，我把这把土带回海岛，就好象带回您老人家对海岛战士的无比温暖和巨大关怀。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怀着一颗赤诚的心，向您老人家宣誓：我们一定要遵照您老人家“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的教导，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，保卫国防，保卫文化大革命。我们海岛战士，一定永远屹立在这个浸透您的光辉思想的红色小岛上，为您老人家放一辈子哨，站一辈子岗。
