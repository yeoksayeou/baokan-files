	Japanese Revolutionary Leftists Hail Chairman Mao's Support for Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Struggle on the Fourth Anniversary of His Talk

	Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Fight On

	Swear to Carry the Revolutionary Struggle of the Japanese People Through to the End

	Beijing, January 26th – Tokyo news: Japanese revolutionary leftists recently issued a statement, enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of the talk by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, "In Support of the Japanese People's Just Anti-American Patriotic Struggle" (January 27th). With boundless love for Chairman Mao, they resolutely declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to advance the anti-American patriotic struggle.

	Fukuda Masayoshi, a standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist Faction), said in a statement: Chairman Mao's talk is a great document. This document, like a beacon, illuminates the road to revolution and liberation for the Japanese people.

	Fukuda said: In this talk, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." This is the great leader Chairman Mao and the brotherly Chinese people's unlimited trust in the Japanese people. This statement will continue to inspire and encourage the Japanese people to carry out their anti-American patriotic struggle.

	Fukuda said, in this talk, Chairman Mao also pointed out to us that the most reliable guarantee for achieving national liberation is to continuously expand the patriotic united front of all strata of the Japanese people against American imperialism's aggression, oppression, and control, and at the same time, to unite with the Chinese and world people, strengthening the broad international united front against American imperialism.

	Fukuda said, after the publication of this great talk by Chairman Mao, it greatly inspired the Japanese people who are controlled and oppressed by American imperialism, guiding the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people to gradually reach a climax.

	Fukuda pointed out: In this great anti-American struggle, the Miyamoto revisionist clique, following Soviet modern revisionism, opposes the unity of the people of Japan and China, and opposes the unity of revolutionary people all over the world. It is increasingly exposing its traitorous face to the broad masses of the Japanese people.

	Fukuda said: The Japanese people are advancing on the great road to victory under the guidance of Chairman Mao. No force can stop them.

	Kojima Takashi of the Saga Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist Faction) said: "Four years of practice has proven that Chairman Mao's instructions are scientific and completely correct. We are full of confidence in the future of the struggle, and at the same time, we have deepened our belief in Mao Zedong Thought."

	Kojima said, recently, the struggle of the Japanese people against the entry of American nuclear warships into Japanese ports has marked a new upsurge in the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. In this struggle, the counter-revolutionary face of the Miyamoto revisionist clique has become increasingly clear, and it has been spit upon by the revolutionary people.

	Kojima emphasized: "As long as we persist in the struggle along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, the Japanese people will definitely break through all obstacles and sabotage by the traitorous clique and achieve final victory."

	Kiyosue Hiroshi of the Kyushu Regional Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Faction) in Fukuoka Prefecture said: A storm of anti-American struggle is sweeping across Japan. The mass movement against the entry of American nuclear warships into ports and in support of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression has developed to a large scale. No matter how the American imperialists and Japanese reactionaries carry out fascist suppression, and no matter how the Miyamoto revisionist clique desperately carries out sabotage, they cannot stop the development of the Japanese people's just anti-American patriotic struggle.

	Kiyosue said, as long as we remember Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought to fight, we will definitely achieve victory.

	Fukunaga Koichi of the Yahata Steel Works Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist Faction) said: "As Chairman Mao said, the Japanese nation will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long. To drive American imperialism out of Japan and to eliminate American imperialism in Asia and the world, the Japanese people must hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely."

	Anbe Junji, chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Democratic Youth League (Leftist Faction), said: More and more Japanese revolutionary people are gradually grasping Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They have criticized the treacherous actions of the Miyamoto revisionist clique and fearlessly fought against American imperialism and its running dogs.

	Anbe said: Japanese revolutionary youth resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, throw themselves into the great storm of struggle, forever take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, constantly reform themselves, stand at the forefront of the Japanese people, and persist in the revolutionary struggle until the final victory.

    日共革命左派欢呼毛主席支持日本人民反美爱国斗争谈话发表四周年
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗坚持战斗
    誓把日本人民的革命斗争进行到底
    新华社二十六日讯  东京消息：日本革命左派最近发表谈话，热烈欢呼世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表四周年（一月二十七日）。他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，坚决表示要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把反美爱国斗争继续推向前进。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）常任委员福田正义发表谈话说：毛主席的这次谈话是一个伟大的文献。这个文献象光芒四射的灯塔，照耀着日本人民革命和解放的道路。
    福田说：毛主席在这一谈话中指出：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这是伟大领袖毛主席和兄弟的中国人民对日本人民的无限信赖。这句话将继续鼓舞和激励日本人民开展反美爱国斗争。
    福田说，毛主席在这次谈话中还向我们指出，争取民族解放胜利的最可靠的保证是不断地扩大日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义的侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线，同时要同中国和世界人民团结起来，加强反对美帝国主义的广泛的国际统一战线。
    福田说，毛主席的这个伟大的谈话发表以后，极大地鼓舞了被美帝国主义控制和压迫的日本人民，引导日本人民的反美斗争逐步地走向高潮。
    福田指出：在这个伟大的反美斗争中，宫本修正主义集团追随苏联现代修正主义，反对日中两国人民的团结，反对全世界革命人民的团结。它在广大日本人民面前愈来愈暴露出它的叛徒面目。
    福田说：日本人民正在毛主席指引的伟大胜利的道路上前进。任何力量也阻挡不了他们。
    日共佐贺县委员会
  （左派）的小岛隆说：“四年来的实践证明毛主席的指示是科学的，是完全正确的。我们对于斗争的前途充满了信心，同时也进一步加深了对毛泽东思想的信仰。”
    小岛说，最近日本人民反对美国核舰只开进日本港口的斗争，标志着日本人民反美爱国斗争的新高涨。在这个斗争中，宫本修正主义集团的反革命面目愈来愈明显了，它已经被革命人民所唾弃。
    小岛强调指出：“只要沿着毛主席所指引的道路坚持斗争，日本人民一定能够突破叛徒集团的一切破坏和障碍，取得最后的胜利。”
    福冈县的日共革命派京筑地区委员会的绪方宽说：日本全国正掀起一个反美斗争的风暴。反对美国核舰只进港、支援越南人民抗美救国战争的群众运动，已发展到很大的规模。不管美帝和日本反动派怎样实行法西斯镇压，也不管宫本修正主义集团如何疯狂地进行破坏，都不能够阻挡日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的发展。
    绪方说，只要我们牢记毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，进行战斗，我们就一定会取得胜利。
    日共八幡制铁所委员会（左派）的福永卯一说：“正象毛主席所说的，日本民族是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。为了把美帝国主义从日本赶出去，并且在亚洲和世界上消灭美帝国主义，日本人民一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，奋勇前进。”
    日本民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）委员长安部淳二说：越来越多的日本革命人民逐步地掌握了毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导。他们清算了宫本修正主义集团的叛卖行径，大无畏地向美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争。
    安部说：日本革命青年坚决高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，投入斗争的大风暴中，永远以“老三篇”当作座右铭，不断地改造自己，站在日本人民的最前列，坚持革命斗争，直到最后胜利。
