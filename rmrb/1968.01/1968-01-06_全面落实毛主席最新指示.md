The New Year's Day editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily have profoundly pointed out: "The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

This means we must take Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and especially his series of extremely important instructions regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the central topic for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and as the basic content for various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We must study and apply them thoroughly, criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie, and align our thoughts and actions with Chairman Mao's, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must start with the fundamental attitude of "loyalty" and the revolutionary learning style of "application."

We must be absolutely loyal to each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, study them earnestly, understand them deeply, follow them consciously, and carry them out resolutely. We must implement them unconditionally, fully, and swiftly, without allowing for so-called "special" circumstances, making excuses, compromising, or dragging our feet. We must not allow any interference from the right or the ultra-left in the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

If we study Chairman Mao's latest instructions but do not apply them, do not implement them in action, then we are being disloyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought.

To ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented, we must mobilize the masses, compare their work with the latest instructions, summarize their work, affirm their achievements, identify gaps, and overcome shortcomings. We must discover and promote good examples, summarize and promote good experiences, and take effective measures to fully implement the latest instructions.

Leaders at all levels must genuinely and modelly lead the way in following each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. To ensure that others are not interfered with, we must first ensure that we ourselves are not interfered with. Only in this way can we lead the great mass movement of studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, class enemies will inevitably adopt hidden and changing tactics to continue their sabotage and disruption. We must be aware of the enemy in our minds. We must strengthen proletarian dictatorship, smash all kinds of plots and tricks of the class enemies, and ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, unify our thoughts, unify our steps, unite as one, and fight bravely, we will surely achieve the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 全面落实毛主席最新指示

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    全面落实毛主席最新指示
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦重要社论深刻地指出：“毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。”
    这就要求我们，把毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，特别是关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的指示，作为活学活用毛泽东思想的中心课题，作为各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班的基本内容，狠学狠用，斗私批修，从思想到行动紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    全面落实毛主席的最新指示，一定要从“忠”字入手抓根本态度，从“用”字入手抓革命学风。
    我们对毛主席的每一项最新指示，必须绝对忠诚，认真学习，深刻领会，自觉紧跟，坚决照办。要无条件地全面落实、迅速落实，不允许强调所谓“特殊”情况，讲条件，打折扣，慢慢吞吞，拖拖拉拉。更不允许从右的或极“左”的方面干扰毛主席最新指示的落实。
    如果我们对毛主席的最新指示，学而不用，不落实到行动上，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的不忠。
    要使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，就要发动群众，对照最新指示，结合当前形势，总结工作，肯定成绩，找出差距，克服缺点。要发现和树立好的典型，总结和推广好的经验，作出全面落实最新指示的有效措施。
    各级领导一定要切实地、模范地带头紧跟毛主席的每一项最新指示。要别人不受干扰，必须首先自己不受干扰。只有这样，才能把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示的伟大群众运动领导起来。
    我们要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，阶级敌人必然还会采取隐蔽和多变的策略，继续进行破坏和捣乱。我们头脑里一定要有敌情观念。要加强无产阶级专政，粉碎各色各样阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，保证无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。
    只要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，统一思想，统一步调，团结一致，英勇奋斗，我们就一定能够夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
