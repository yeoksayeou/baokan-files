The Ministry of National Defense held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the cultural warriors from the front lines of the anti-American struggle—the Vietnamese South Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe.

In the banquet filled with the warm atmosphere of fraternal solidarity and great friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam, Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu and the troupe leader Nguyen Thuan Hung delivered speeches.

Su Yu said, the heroic people and military of South Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in the war of resistance against America, greatly enriching the experience of people's war and powerfully demonstrating the boundless might of a great people's war. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his congratulatory telegram to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, "Your victories once again show that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated. The Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, are waging a war of resistance against America, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations to win liberation."

He pointed out that the current situation in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America is excellent. The days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are numbered. But, "All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The ruthless American imperialists not only continue to send troops to South Vietnam, threatening to expand the war to Cambodia and Laos, but also attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnam, colluding with Soviet modern revisionists to play the "peace talks" trick, desperately trying to use counter-revolutionary means to save their failing situation in Vietnam. But this is all in vain and will never succeed! The more the American imperialists expand their aggression, the more miserably they will fail, and the faster they will head towards their doom. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will definitely overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, persist in a protracted struggle, drive the American aggressors out of their country entirely, and achieve a thorough victory in the war of resistance against America!

Su Yu said, currently, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also in an excellent situation. The revolutionary situation is developing like a surging river. A broad and deep revolutionary mass movement is continuing to develop victoriously according to the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao. The people of the entire country are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, full of spirit and fighting spirit, striving forward to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The various slanders and rumors spread by American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have already met with shameful failure. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have become stronger and will certainly provide more powerful support to the Vietnamese people's great war of resistance against America.

Su Yu, in talking about the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam, pointed out that China and Vietnam are neighboring countries with a close relationship, and the peoples and armies of the two countries are brothers who share weal and woe. American imperialism is the common enemy that the peoples of China and Vietnam share a deep hatred for. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The seven hundred million Chinese people are the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly unite with the heroic Vietnamese people and army, fight together, and win together. We will unswervingly provide full support to the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America until the final victory in the war of resistance against America is achieved!

Troupe leader Nguyen Thuan Hung, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the great leader Chairman Mao in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

He said, at a time when the military and people of South Vietnam are achieving brilliant results in the fight against the American aggressors, we heard from the radio the news of the Chinese people enthusiastically celebrating the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, especially Chairman Mao's telegram to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, which once again affirmed the firm support of the fraternal Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America. Nguyen Thuan Hung said, the people of South Vietnam and their sole genuine representative—the National Liberation Front—are deeply convinced that "the seven hundred million Chinese people are the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people." Chairman Mao's special concern for the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America deeply moved us. The Chinese people have provided tremendous and precious assistance to our cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the country in the fight against American aggression, and we highly appreciate this assistance. He said, the people of South Vietnam and the people's liberation armed forces are full of confidence, steadfast and united, determined to overcome all difficulties and hardships, and accomplish the great historical task of thoroughly defeating the American aggressors.

Guests invited to the banquet included Nguyen Van Khoa, head of the permanent representative office of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front in China, and his deputy Nguyen Minh Phuong, Charge d'Affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China Ly Chung Chi, and Colonel Chen Wenping, military attache of the embassy, as well as all members of the song and dance troupe.

Vice Minister of National Defense Xiao Jingguang, Wang Shusheng, and leaders from various departments, branches, and services of the People's Liberation Army, as well as relevant departments, including Li Tianyou, Wang Xintang, Wen Yuceng, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chuming, Li Zuopeng, Yu Lijin, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Xiuchuan, and Luo Xunchu, as well as Luo Guibo and Chu Tunan, attended the banquet as hosts.

At the end of the banquet, the hosts and guests together sang "The East Is Red" and "Liberate the South."

    国防部举行宴会热烈欢迎越南南方解放军歌舞团
    中越人民和军队永远团结战斗在一起
    粟裕同志和阮春鸿团长在宴会上热烈称颂中越人民牢不可破的战斗友谊
    新华社十二日讯　国防部今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎来自反美斗争最前线的文艺战士——越南南方解放军歌舞团。
    在充满中越两国人民和军队之间兄弟般战斗团结和伟大友谊的热烈气氛的宴会上，国防部副部长粟裕和歌舞团团长阮春鸿先后讲了话。
    粟裕说，英雄的越南南方军民，在抗美救国战争中所取得的辉煌胜利，极大地丰富了人民战争的经验，雄辩地证明了伟大的人民战争的无穷威力。正如我们伟大统帅毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电中所指出的：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下进行的抗美救国战争，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。”
    他指出，当前越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势是一片大好。美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。但是“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。穷凶极恶的美帝国主义不仅继续增兵越南南方，叫嚷把战争扩大到柬埔寨和老挝，而且企图利用联合国插手干涉越南，勾结苏联现代修正主义者玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图用反革命的两手来挽救它在越南的败局。但这完全是枉费心机，是永远办不到的！美帝国主义越是扩大侵略，就必然会失败得越惨，就必然更快地走向覆灭的绝境。我们坚信：英雄的越南人民，一定能够克服前进道路上的一切困难，坚持持久战，把美国侵略者全部赶出自己的国土，取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利！
    粟裕说，当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，更是一片大好形势。革命形势的发展如江河奔泻，空前广泛和深入的革命群众运动，正按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署继续胜利发展。全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和他们的走狗，对中国无产阶级文化大革命的种种造谣诽谤，已经遭到了可耻的破产。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，力量更加强大了，一定会更加有力地支援越南人民的伟大抗美救国战争。
    粟裕在谈到中越两国人民和军队之间的友谊时指出，中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦，中越两国人民及其军队是休戚与共的兄弟。美帝国主义是中、越两国人民不共戴天的共同敌人。我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，将永远遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决同英雄的越南人民及军队，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。坚定不移地全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
    阮春鸿团长在讲话中热烈赞扬中国人民在以伟大领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    他说，正当越南南方军民在抗击美国侵略者的战斗中取得辉煌战绩的时候，我们从广播中听到了中国人民热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的消息，尤其是毛主席打给阮友寿主席的贺电，再一次地肯定了兄弟的中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的决心。阮春鸿说，越南南方人民及其唯一的真正代表——民族解放阵线深信：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”毛主席对我们越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的特殊关怀，使我们无比感动。中国人民对我们解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的反美斗争事业给予了巨大和可贵的援助，我们对这种援助给以极高评价。他说，越南南方人民及人民解放武装力量信心百倍，坚定不移，同心协力，决心克服一切艰难困苦，完成彻底打败美国侵略强盗的伟大历史任务。
    应邀出席宴会的有越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广、副团长阮明芳，越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始、大使馆武官陈文彭上校等和歌舞团全体成员。
    国防部副部长萧劲光、王树声，人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种、国防科委负责人李天佑、王新亭、温玉成、邱会作、张池明、李作鹏、余立金、王宏坤、张秀川、罗舜初等，以及有关方面负责人罗贵波、楚图南出席宴会作陪。
    宴会结束时，宾主同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《解放南方》。
