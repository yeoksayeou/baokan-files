The revolutionary great alliance committee of the Jilin Railway region has been established. When the congratulatory telegram from the State Council was read at the celebration rally, the broad revolutionary workers repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 18th — The broad revolutionary workers of the Jilin Railway region, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have achieved revolutionary great alliance. This is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

On the 17th, more than 20,000 revolutionary workers and soldiers from the two factions of the Jilin Railway region and the Jilin garrison braved the minus 30-degree cold, holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered at the Jilin Railway Station Square to solemnly celebrate the establishment of the Jilin Railway region revolutionary great alliance committee.

The meeting began with the resounding music of "The East Is Red." The responsible comrade of the Jilin Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army read the congratulatory telegram from the State Council at the meeting. During the reading of the telegram, people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Comrades from the Jilin Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Xie Zhengrong, Zhao Bing'an, Cao Haibin, and Gong Yurang, attended the meeting. Comrade Xie Zhengrong, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the Jilin Garrison, extended warm congratulations and firm support to the establishment of the Jilin Railway region revolutionary great alliance committee.

The Jilin Railway Bureau is responsible for the heavy transportation tasks in the eastern part of Northeast China. After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the two revolutionary mass organizations of the Jilin Railway region immediately followed Chairman Mao's teachings and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They took "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key, overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and promoted revolutionary great alliance. The broad revolutionary workers of various grassroots units under the Jilin Railway Bureau, inspired by the joyous news of the revolutionary great alliance of the two factions of revolutionary workers in the Jilin Railway region, quickly launched a high tide of revolutionary great alliance. In recent days, they have achieved revolutionary great alliance one after another. The broad revolutionary workers are determined to study the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily in 1968, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, and seize the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The representative of the Jilin Railway region great alliance committee said at the meeting that the railway workers with a glorious revolutionary tradition are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We are determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions into action as quickly as possible, making every comrade a model in studying, executing, propagating, and defending the latest instructions. In the brilliant year of 1968, we will redouble our efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and definitely do a better job in shouldering the double burdens of revolution and production, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," love the People's Liberation Army, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and be models in supporting the army. We must seriously maintain the revolutionary order of railway transportation, consciously observe labor discipline, actively improve transportation efficiency, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's transportation production plan. We will strive to achieve the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

The meeting adopted a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. A grand parade was held after the meeting.
