British imperialists and Soviet revisionists are tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion. Wilson visits the Soviet Union to conspire with Soviet revisionist leaders, serving the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" plot.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on January 26, Moscow: Just as U.S. imperialism suffers repeated defeats in the Vietnam War, and its policy of "war and peace" in Vietnam faces repeated humiliating failures, British Prime Minister Wilson rushed to the Soviet Union on January 22. He held three days of intense secret talks with the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique on the Vietnam issue and other major issues, actively serving the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" plot.

Wilson has been enthusiastic about acting as a political broker for the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" plot for several years. In the past two years, the Soviet revisionist leaders and Wilson have had three direct meetings in Moscow and London on the so-called Vietnam "peace talks" issue, each time under the remote control and guidance of Washington; this time is no exception. It is reported that just a few hours before Wilson arrived in Moscow on January 22, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, unusually requested a meeting with Kosygin, handing him a "secret letter" from U.S. President Johnson. Johnson informed Kosygin, who was meeting with Wilson, of "some new U.S. policy actions." Before this, Wilson also sent his Foreign Secretary, Brown, to Washington in mid-January to have "extremely frank talks" with U.S. Secretary of State Rusk on the Vietnam issue.

Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny showed unusual courtesy to Wilson's visit to the Soviet Union, holding talks with him separately. The Vietnam issue was the central topic of their discussions. It is reported that during the talks, Wilson "informed Brezhnev and Kosygin of the exact and latest situation regarding the U.S. thoughts on Vietnam" and learned about the Soviet revisionists' "thoughts on the Vietnam issue." The joint statement issued by both sides on January 24 "emphasized the urgency of a political solution" to the Vietnam issue, "determined to jointly or separately do everything possible to achieve this goal."

On January 23, after a long talk with Kosygin, Wilson, in a state of self-satisfaction, told this Soviet revisionist leader at the banquet held for him by Kosygin that he saw the "bridge to peace in Vietnam" had "greatly shortened" compared to before. He said, "We can both help build the bridge to peace in Vietnam, which has now greatly shortened." Wilson's remarks unwittingly admitted that the Soviet revisionists and British imperialists, these two accomplices of U.S. imperialism, are conspiring to actively serve the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" plot, attempting to salvage the U.S. imperialist's defeat in the Vietnam battlefield and strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

In addition to the Vietnam issue, both sides also discussed the Middle East situation, "European security," "prevention of nuclear proliferation," disarmament, and bilateral relations during this round of talks.

Regarding the Middle East situation, both sides advocated in the joint statement for the "prompt implementation" of the United Nations Security Council resolution, manipulated by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, which was passed in November last year, forcing Arab countries to fully surrender to the aggressors. They also expressed "support" for the United Nations "special envoy" Jarring's recent activities in the Middle East region to peddle this resolution and continue to exert pressure on Arab countries. This once again exposed the Soviet revisionist clique's active role as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, further betraying the interests of the Arab people.

Both sides also expressed "great satisfaction" in the joint statement about the draft of the "treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation" jointly concocted by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and advocated for its "prompt conclusion." This treaty, aimed at China, continues to blackmail the people of the world with nuclear weapons. Regarding Soviet-British relations, the joint statement mentioned the connections and "cooperation" between the two countries in various aspects. The statement said that in the future, the leaders of the two countries will continue to "maintain close and regular contact" on "mutual concerns."

    英帝苏修加紧反革命勾结
    威尔逊到苏联同苏修头目狼狈为奸替美帝“和谈”阴谋效劳
    据新华社二十六日讯  莫斯科消息：正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中迭遭失败，战“和”两手的侵越政策一再遭到可耻破产的时候，英国首相威尔逊在二十二日跑到苏联，同苏修领导集团的头目们就越南问题以及其他重大问题进行了三天的紧张秘密会谈，积极为美帝的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    威尔逊几年来一直热心充当美帝“和谈”阴谋的政治掮客。在过去的两年中，苏修头目和威尔逊分别在莫斯科和伦敦已经就所谓越南“和谈”问题进行过三次直接勾搭，每一次勾搭都是在华盛顿的遥控牵引下进行的；这次也不例外。据报道，就在威尔逊二十二日到达莫斯科前几个小时，美国驻苏联大使汤普森异乎寻常地要求柯西金接见他，向柯西金递交了美国总统约翰逊的一封“秘密信件”。约翰逊在信件中“把美国某种新的政策行动”告诉了同威尔逊会谈的苏修头目柯西金。在这以前，威尔逊还派他的外交大臣布朗于一月中旬赶到华盛顿同美国国务卿腊斯克就越南问题“进行了极其坦率的会谈”。
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金和波德戈尔内对威尔逊的这次访苏显得格外殷勤，分别同威尔逊进行了会谈，越南问题是他们会谈的中心议题。据报道，威尔逊在会谈中，
  “把美国关于越南的想法的确切和最新的情况告诉了”勃列日涅夫和柯西金等人，并了解了苏修“关于越南问题的想法”。双方在二十四日发表的联合公报中“强调指出了政治解决”越南问题的“迫切性”，
  “决心共同地或者分别地为达到这一目的而尽其一切所能”。
    一月二十三日，在同柯西金长时间的会谈结束以后，威尔逊在柯西金为他举行的宴会上得意忘形地对这个苏修头目说，他看到了通向“越南和平”的“桥梁”比以前已经“大大缩短了”。他说：“我们双方都能帮助建立现在已经大大缩短了的通向（越南）和平的桥梁。”威尔逊的这一番话不打自招地供认，苏修英帝这两个美帝帮凶狼狈为奸，正在加紧为美帝的“和谈”阴谋效劳，妄图挽救美帝在越南战场上的败局，扼杀越南人民抗美救国的斗争。
    除越南问题外，苏英双方在这次会谈中还就中东局势、“欧洲安全”、“防止核扩散”、裁军以及两国关系等问题进行了密商。
    关于中东局势，双方在联合公报中鼓吹“尽快实现”联合国安理会在美帝苏修的操纵下，在去年十一月通过的逼迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者全面投降的决议，并且表示“支持”联合国“特使”雅林最近到中东地区兜售这个决议，继续对阿拉伯国家施加压力的活动。这再一次暴露了苏修集团积极充当美帝的头号帮凶，进一步叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的丑恶嘴脸。
    双方在联合公报中还对美帝苏修合伙炮制的
  “防止核扩散条约”草案的出笼表示“非常满意”，并且鼓吹“尽速缔结”这个矛头针对中国、继续对全世界人民实行核讹诈的条约。关于苏英关系，联合公报谈到了两国在各个方面的联系和“合作”。公报说，今后两国的头子将继续就“互相关心的问题”“保持密切的和经常的接触”。
