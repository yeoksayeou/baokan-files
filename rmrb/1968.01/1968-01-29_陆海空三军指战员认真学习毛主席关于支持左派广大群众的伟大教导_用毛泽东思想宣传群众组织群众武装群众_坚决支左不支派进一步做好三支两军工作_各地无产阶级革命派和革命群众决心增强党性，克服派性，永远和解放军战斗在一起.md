Edition: 1

PLA troops from the army, navy, and air force are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's great teachings on supporting the leftist broad masses. They are using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. They resolutely support the left without supporting any faction, further doing a good job of the "three supports and two militaries" work. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places have decided to strengthen their party spirit, overcome factionalism, and forever fight alongside the PLA.

On January 28, the New China News Agency reported that on the first anniversary of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao issuing the great call for the PLA to support the leftist broad masses, the publication of the important editorial "Seriously Implement the Principle of Supporting the Left but Not Supporting Any Faction" in the PLA Daily has brought immense inspiration to the entire army. The broad masses of soldiers and officers are filled with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao. They solemnly declare that they will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, further do a good job of the "three supports and two militaries" work, and create new merits for the people in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, as soon as the important editorial "Seriously Implement the Principle of Supporting the Left but Not Supporting Any Faction" was published, a widespread and enthusiastic learning wave immediately swept through the entire army. The soldiers and officers unanimously pointed out that on the occasion of the first anniversary of Chairman Mao issuing the great call for the PLA to support the leftist broad masses, the important editorial published in the PLA Daily is a new battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to our army to further do a good job of the "three supports and two militaries" work. Seriously implementing the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction is the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, doing a better job of the "three supports and two militaries" work, and an important sign of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry it out.

Today, the various headquarters, military branches, National Defense Science Commission, National Defense Industry Office, Beijing Military Region leadership organs, representatives attending the Fourth National Conference on Active Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works of the General Staff Department, General Political Department, Air Force, and Second Artillery Force, as well as the troops in Shanghai, Tianjin, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Jinan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places, the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Regions, and the Beijing Garrison Command, have all studied and discussed the editorial. Many military leadership organs have also sent telegrams and phone calls to notify the troops stationed at the coastal and border outposts and the broad masses of soldiers and officers on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" to seriously organize learning and resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, doing it in action to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many troops in Beijing, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and other places have also used the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction as a weapon to seriously review and summarize the "three supports and two militaries" work.

During the study and discussion, the broad masses of soldiers and officers, combined with their practical experiences in supporting the left, further realized that the most fundamental aspect of adhering to the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction is to genuinely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and support the leftist broad masses. All revolutionary mass organizations should be supported, and it is not permissible to favor one faction and neglect another, support one faction and suppress another. It is also not permissible to say, "You are the left, so I support you in everything." For their statements and actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely support them. For some people's bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within them, we must not support it and must use Mao Zedong Thought to help them overcome and correct it. The broad masses of soldiers and officers said that only by doing so can we promote revolutionary great unity, unite the broad revolutionary masses, defeat the class enemies, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representative of the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, who attended the Fourth National Conference on Active Study and Application of Mao Zedong Thought of the General Staff Department, reviewed the support work of the past few months after studying the editorial. When they first entered the factory, the two revolutionary mass organizations were fighting an "internal war" fiercely, and both demanded that the support personnel take a stand to support them. The support personnel did not support one faction and suppress another but organized the two revolutionary mass organizations to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, study Chairman Mao's teachings on achieving revolutionary great unity, and help the two mass organizations use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome factionalism, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the factory. Ancient said that through this period of practice, they deeply felt that to achieve supporting the left but not supporting any faction, one must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. In a word, using Mao Zedong Thought to support the left is victory. The soldiers and officers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" studied the editorial seriously, combining their experiences in supporting the left at the Shanghai Taopu Chemical Factory. They did not support one faction and suppress another, favor one faction and neglect another in this chemical factory. Instead, they did in-depth, detailed, and arduous political work for the several revolutionary mass organizations, the masses who had been deceived, and the cadres who had made mistakes, promoting their quick achievement of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, making the entire factory's revolution and production present a prosperous scene. The soldiers and officers said that the support personnel must believe in the majority of the masses, rely on the majority of the masses, and genuinely achieve supporting the left but not supporting any faction to truly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The responsible person of the support unit in Huicheng, Guangdong, after studying the editorial, said with deep feelings that the past year's practice of supporting the left completely proved that seriously implementing the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction is the key to doing a good job of the "three supports and two militaries" work. To achieve supporting the left but not supporting any faction, one must follow Chairman Mao's instructions at all times and in all things, resolutely resist the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in society, and use Mao Zedong Thought to help the broad revolutionary masses. One must strive to promote the two revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" unanimously pointed out during the review of Chairman Mao's great call and the repeated study of the important editorial of the PLA Daily that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a reactionary social trend. They declared that they would definitely take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, criticize and repudiate revisionism, strengthen ideological revolutionization, resolutely resist the influence of this reactionary trend, and in the new year, raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and take Li Wenzhong, the heroic Fourth Platoon, and the support personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory as examples to seriously implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, doing a better job of the "three supports and two militaries" work. The soldiers and officers emphasized that when carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks, one must never forget class struggle, must heighten revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, frustrate the plots of domestic and foreign class enemies to sabotage military-civilian unity and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, strengthen military-civilian unity, and create new merits for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On January 28, the New China News Agency reported that on the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao issuing the great call for the PLA to support the leftist broad masses, the PLA Daily published the important editorial "Seriously Implement the Principle of Supporting the Left but Not Supporting Any Faction." The broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places were all inspired and enthusiastically studied and discussed it.

They decided to strongly help the PLA seriously implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, wage a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses in various places, during the study and discussion of the important editorial of the PLA Daily, warmly praised the PLA for resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call for the PLA to support the leftist broad masses and the meritorious deeds created in the "three supports and two militaries." They said that the PLA high-held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, in the "three supports and two militaries" work, seriously implemented the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, helped the revolutionary masses fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which is excellent! We support it a thousand times, we support it ten thousand times.

The broad revolutionary cadres in the capital earnestly studied the editorial of the PLA Daily, held discussions, and unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and stand with the PLA, helping the PLA seriously implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, linking the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, said that the support personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed at our factory have persistently propagated Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believed in and relied on the masses, seriously implemented the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction, and strived to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our revolutionary ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advancing victoriously. The advanced collective of the 8341st Unit stationed at our factory is indeed a red flag in the support work across the country. We will definitely raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, strengthen military-civilian unity, and under the help of the support personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed at the factory, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The responsible person of the "Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters" said after studying the editorial of the PLA Daily: In our "Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters" system, where the problems are the most and the difficulties are the greatest, the PLA goes there to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Many units where the two revolutionary mass organizations have long been opposed have quickly achieved revolutionary great unity under the help of comrades in the PLA who insist on the principle of supporting the left but not supporting any faction. The facts have proven that the PLA holds the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest. We will definitely learn from the PLA, resolutely support the PLA, and use actual actions to defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and assist the PLA in doing a better job of the "three supports and two militaries" work. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, who created the experience of achieving revolutionary great unity according to administrative departments, said that the achievements of the Guiyang Cotton Mill are the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, inseparable from the PLA responding to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly standing on the side of the revolutionary left, and using Mao Zedong Thought to support the leftist broad masses. We will definitely raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the new year, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and turn our mill into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places emphasized during the study and discussion that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has already achieved decisive victories, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism have become an important weapon for the class enemies to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must thoroughly defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and resolutely frustrate the plots of the class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and its affiliated systems and units have held multiple "Fully Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Defeat Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism" mobilization meetings, finding the harms of factionalism, listing the crimes of factionalism, and digging up the roots of factionalism. The revolutionary masses said during the discussion of the editorial of the PLA Daily that supporting the left but not supporting any faction is a great order issued by the proletarian headquarters to the PLA. The PLA resolutely implements this principle, which is an important sign of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For us revolutionary masses, in the new situation, whether or not to defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is also an important sign of being loyal to Chairman Mao. We, the children of Jinggangshan, must definitely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of ideology and organization, helping the PLA do a better job of the "three supports and two militaries" work and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary workers of the Xi'an textile industry system said that we revolutionary workers will definitely defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, unite, and fight against the enemy together. The 54 factories and enterprises in the Xi'an textile system have now achieved revolutionary great unity in 46 units. The revolutionary workers of the Wuhan Zhongyuan Machinery Factory said that some comrades from the two revolutionary mass organizations originally had factionalism and could not reach an agreement on revolutionary great unity after several discussions. Recently, with the strong support of the support unit stationed at the factory, the revolutionary masses of the entire factory launched a "people's war" to besiege and annihilate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and establishing the factory revolutionary committee. After studying the editorial of the PLA Daily, the revolutionary workers of this factory further realized that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the most dangerous enemy obstructing the current revolutionary direction. Being bewitched by factionalism, one's mind is confused, and one's steps are hindered. To defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, one must wage a "people's war." In the great tide of besieging and annihilating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, 11 out of the 12 departments and factories of Lanzhou University have achieved revolutionary great unity. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school, after studying the important editorial of the PLA Daily, expressed that they would further run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and make factionalism stink. They must resolutely not say anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, not do anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and make new contributions to consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in various places unanimously expressed during the study of the editorial of the PLA Daily that they must learn from the PLA, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and be like the PLA, with red hearts for Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao without leaving his side, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    陆海空三军指战员认真学习毛主席关于支持左派广大群众的伟大教导
    用毛泽东思想宣传群众组织群众武装群众
    坚决支左不支派进一步做好三支两军工作
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众决心增强党性，克服派性，永远和解放军战斗在一起
    新华社二十八日讯　在人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员热烈纪念我们最敬爱的伟大统帅毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召一周年的时候，《解放军报》重要社论《认真执行支左不支派的原则》的发表，给全军指战员带来了巨大的鼓舞。广大指战员怀着对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，庄严表示，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中为人民立新功。
    今天，《认真执行支左不支派的原则》这篇重要社论一发表，全军上下立即掀起了广泛热烈的学习热潮。指战员们一致指出，在热烈纪念毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召一周年之际，《解放军报》发表的这篇重要社论，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部向我军发出的进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作的新的战斗号令。认真执行支左不支派的原则，是我军条条落实、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好的关键，是在无产阶级文化大革命发展到现在的新形势下，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    今天，中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种、国防科委、国防工办，北京部队领导机关，出席总参谋部、总后勤部、空军和第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表，以及上海、天津、兰州、武汉、济南、沈阳、广州、南京、福州、成都、昆明等部队，西藏、新疆军区和北京卫戍区的广大指战员，都对这篇社论进行了学习、座谈。不少部队领导机关，还通过电报、电话，通知驻守在海防边防前哨的部队和分布在广阔的“三支”
  “两军”第一线上的广大指战员，认真组织学习，坚决把支左不支派的原则落实在行动上，做到永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。北京、上海、兰州、广州、沈阳等地许多部队，还以支左不支派的原则为武器，认真检查、总结了“三支”“两军”工作。
    在学习座谈中，广大指战员结合支左工作中的切身体会，进一步认识到，坚持支左不支派的原则，最根本的就是切实遵照毛主席的教导，支持左派广大群众。凡是革命的群众组织，都要支持，不能亲一派，疏一派，支一派，压一派。也不能“你是左派我就什么都支持”，对于他们符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，就坚决支持，对于他们中间一些人的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就决不能支持，就要用毛泽东思想帮助他们克服和纠正。广大指战员说，只有这样做，才能促进革命大联合，团结广大革命群众，战胜阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    出席人民解放军总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想代表大会的八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员古远兴，学了社论以后回顾了几个月来的支左工作。他们刚进厂时，两派革命群众组织打“内战”很激烈，都要求支左人员表态支持。支左人员没有支一派压一派，而是组织两派革命群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，学习毛主席关于实现革命大联合的教导，帮助两派群众用毛泽东思想克服派性，使这个厂迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。古远兴说，他们通过这一段的实践，深深体会到要做到支左不支派，就要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众。一句话，用毛泽东思想去支左就是胜利。“南京路上好八连”的指战员，结合在上海桃浦化工厂支左的体会，认真地学习了社论。他们在这个化工厂没有支一派，压一派，亲一派，疏一派，而是对几派革命群众，对受过蒙蔽的群众，对犯过错误的干部，都做深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，促进他们很快实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，使全厂革命、生产，都呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。指战员们说，支左人员只有相信群众的大多数，依靠群众的大多数，真正做到支左不支派，才能真正贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。驻广东惠阳支左部队负责人学习社论后深有体会地说，过去一年的支左实践完全证明，认真执行支左不支派的原则，是做好“三支”“两军”工作的关键。要做到支左不支派，就必须时时事事照毛主席的指示办事，坚决抵制社会上资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的干扰，用毛泽东思想帮助广大革命群众，要努力促进两派革命群众组织，在革命原则的基础上，实现革命的大联合。
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，在重温毛主席的伟大号召，反复学习《解放军报》的重要社论时一致指出，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一种反动的社会思潮。他们表示，一定以毛主席的最新指示为纲，斗私批修，加强思想革命化，坚决抵制这种反动思潮的影响，在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地落实毛主席的最新指示，以李文忠同志、英雄四排和八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员为榜样，认真执行支左不支派的原则，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。指战员们强调指出，在执行“三支”“两军”任务的时候，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，要百倍提高革命警惕，粉碎国内外阶级敌人破坏军民团结、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，大力加强军民团结，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利创立新功。
    新华社二十八日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召一周年的时候，《解放军报》发表了《认真执行支左不支派的原则》的重要社论，各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众无不欢欣鼓舞，纷纷进行学习、座谈。
    他们决心大力帮助人民解放军认真执行支左不支派的原则，同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性进行坚决的、不调和的斗争，增强无产阶级党性，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    各地广大革命群众在学习、座谈《解放军报》这篇重要社论时，热烈赞扬人民解放军坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，在“三支”“两军”中创建的丰功伟绩。他们说，人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“三支”“两军”工作中，认真执行支左不支派的原则，帮助革命群众条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，好得很！我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护。
    首都广大无产阶级革命派认真学习《解放军报》的社论，纷纷举行座谈，一致表示要坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，和解放军站在一起，帮助解放军认真执行支左不支派的原则。北京针织总厂的革命职工联系一年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践说，人民解放军八三四一部队驻我厂的支左人员，坚持不懈地宣传毛泽东思想，坚定不移地相信和依靠群众，认真地执行了支左不支派的原则，努力把我们革命队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断胜利前进。八三四一部队驻我厂支左人员这一先进集体，不愧为全国支左工作的一面红旗。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力加强军民团结，在八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。上海“工总司”负责人学习了《解放军报》社论后深有体会地说：在我们“工总司”所属的系统内，那里的问题最多，困难最大，解放军就到那里去宣传毛泽东思想。许多两派群众组织长期对立的单位，在坚持支左不支派原则的解放军同志的帮助下，迅速实现了革命大联合。事实证明，解放军毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，我们决心向解放军学习，坚决拥护解放军，支持解放军，用打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性的实际行动，协助解放军把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。创造了按行政部门实现革命大联合经验的贵阳棉纺厂的无产阶级革命派表示，贵阳棉纺厂取得的成绩，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是与解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚定地站在革命左派一边，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众分不开的。我们决心在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把我厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众在学习和座谈中强调指出，在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的今天，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，已经成为阶级敌人反对无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要武器。要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，一定要彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚决粉碎阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋。
    江西省大联筹及所属各系统、各单位，最近连续召开了多次“全面落实毛主席最新指示，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性”的誓师大会，大找派性的危害，大摆派性的罪状，大挖派性的老根。革命群众在座谈《解放军报》的社论时说，支左不支派，这是无产阶级司令部对人民解放军发出的伟大号令。解放军坚决执行这一原则，是在无产阶级文化大革命发展到现在的新形势下，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。对于我们革命群众来说，在新形势下，肯不肯打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，也是忠不忠于毛主席的一个重要标志。我们井冈山儿女，一定要认真克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，从思想上、组织上进一步巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，帮助人民解放军把“三支”“两军”工作搞得好上加好，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。西安纺织工业系统的广大革命职工说，我们革命职工坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，联合起来，共同对敌。西安纺织系统的五十四个工厂企业，现在已有四十六个单位实现了革命大联合。武汉中原机械厂两派革命群众组织的一些同志，原来由于有派性，几次商谈大联合，都没有谈拢。最近在驻厂支左部队的大力支持下，全厂革命群众发动了围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，全厂很快实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，成立了厂革命委员会。这个厂的革命职工学习了《解放军报》社论以后，进一步认识到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是妨碍当前革命大方向的最危险的敌人，被派性迷住了心窍，缠住了身子，就昏头转向，寸步难行。要打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，必须打一场
  “人民战争”。在声势浩大的围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的高潮中，兰州大学十二个系、工厂，已经有十一个单位实现了革命的大联合。全校革命师生学习了《解放军报》的重要社论后表示，要进一步办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，搞臭派性。坚决做到不符合毛泽东思想的话不说，不符合毛泽东思想的事不做，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合做出新的贡献。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在学习《解放军报》社论时一致表示，一定要向无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军学习，象解放军那样，对毛主席赤胆忠心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离，坚决听毛主席的话，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。（附图片）
