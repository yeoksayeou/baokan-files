The victories achieved by the Vietnamese military and civilians this year have great strategic significance and have created very favorable conditions for the Vietnamese military and civilians to further thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	After discussing Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent battle call, the editorial said: "Everything for the complete defeat of the American aggressors! This is a battle order to the entire party, army, and people."

	The statement listed a series of facts, exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese and Thai lackeys in repeatedly violating Cambodia. The statement said that U.S. imperialism is deeply mired in Vietnam. It recklessly expands the war and invades Cambodia, and it will sink deeper and will inevitably suffer complete failure.

	The statement said that as brothers and comrades of the Cambodian people, the peoples of Indochina will stand side by side with the Cambodian people to resolutely defeat the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. The statement strongly protests against the invasion plots and actions of the United States and its lackeys against the Kingdom of Cambodia and sternly warns that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of its invasion of Cambodia.

	The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its complete support for the correct position stated in the statement issued by the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia on December 26, 1967.

	The statement said that it is the inalienable sacred right of Cambodia to call on various friendly countries to provide assistance when necessary to defeat the American aggressors. The Vietnamese people are ready at any time to do their best to meet all the requirements of the government and people of the Kingdom of Cambodia in any situation.
