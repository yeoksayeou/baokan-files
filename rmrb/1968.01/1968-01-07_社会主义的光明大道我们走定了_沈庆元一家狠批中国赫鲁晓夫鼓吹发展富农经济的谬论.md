The revolutionary criticism in Hongjin Brigade of Shaxi People's Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, has developed from production teams to the households of commune members. Every family has set up a stage for criticizing selfishness and revisionism. This is a sign of the deepening of the revolutionary criticism in rural areas.

The family criticism meetings of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongjin Brigade use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism; at the same time, they link the criticism to actual conditions, criticizing the bourgeois worldview in their own minds. Through the criticism, they sweep away all the poison and influence of the exploiting classes from their families, further promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

Currently, one of the important contents of the Cultural Revolution in rural areas is to insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, with "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the key, creating and using various forms to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to participate in the revolutionary criticism. In the revolutionary criticism, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, arm the broad masses of commune members with Mao Zedong Thought, so that they understand the great truth of carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must further draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism, and between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must build an iron wall in the minds of the broad masses of the people to prevent and combat revisionism, ensuring that our country will never change color for thousands of generations.

We Will Definitely Walk the Bright Path of Socialism
—Sten Regency Family Severely Criticizes the Fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev Advocating the Development of Rich Peasant Economy

After dinner, the poor peasant commune member Sten Regency and his family, each holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in advocating the development of the rich peasant economy. The family criticism meeting began with the recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations.

The Chinese Khrushchev Loves Landlords and Rich Peasants

Sten Regency spoke first: The Chinese Khrushchev has been dismantling the collective economy and undermining the foundations of socialism for a long time, advocating the development of the rich peasant economy, and saying nonsense like "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation saves people," "we should welcome exploitation," and "when there are seventy percent of households with three horses, it will be good to establish collective farms in the future." This is truly disgusting. For more than a decade, the Chinese Khrushchev has been implementing a line of restoring capitalism in the countryside. Tonight, we are holding a family criticism meeting to first criticize his fallacies about the development of the rich peasant economy.

Sten Wangda (Sten Regency's mother) continued: The Chinese Khrushchev's talk about "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation saves people" is all nonsense. Whenever I hear about exploitation, I am filled with rage, and the bitterness of class oppression in the old society comes back to me. I started working as a short-term laborer for landlords and rich peasants at the age of thirteen and worked for twenty-six years. If it weren't for the liberation, when would my days of short-term labor end? Those days were truly miserable! At the age of twenty-two, I gave birth to a daughter, but after thirteen days, I had to go to the fields to work for the landlords and rich peasants, shedding sweat in the landlords' fields and tears in my own belly. My second daughter, because we couldn't afford to feed her, was suffocated to death just after birth. My third daughter, soon after she was born, was sent away to be a child bride. In the old society, the rent was heavy, the taxes were high, and the interest was exorbitant. The poor had only three choices: starve, hang themselves, or go to jail.

Our sworn enemy, the Chinese Khrushchev, is lying with his eyes open, saying nonsense like "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation saves people." What kind of heart does he have! We want to ask the Chinese Khrushchev: Whom are you saving? You are saving the landlords and rich peasants.

Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our great benefactor. Chairman Mao saved us from the bitter sea of the old society, led us to organize and walk the path of collectivization, and we have stood up, become masters, and taken control. Our lives are like eating sugarcane from the bottom up, getting sweeter with each section. Now we have installed loudspeakers, and I, being old, can listen to national affairs at home. In the past, we had to pull water, plow fields, thresh grain, and carry loads. Every aspect of fieldwork required manual labor. After the establishment of the commune, with the support of the working class, our brigade has achieved electrification of irrigation and threshing, mechanization of plowing, and is not afraid of drought or flooding, achieving bumper harvests year after year. Without Chairman Mao, how could we have today!

The Chinese Khrushchev Relies on Landlords and Rich Peasants

Xiao Feng'e (Sten Regency's wife, a poor peasant female commune member) said: The Chinese Khrushchev, this filial son and grandson of landlords and rich peasants, talks nonsense about "when there are seventy percent of households with three horses, it will be good to establish collective farms in the future." Whose class is this? What is this "household with three horses, one plow, and one cart"? If we open Chairman Mao's brilliant work "How to Analyze the Classes in Rural Areas," it is very clear. Chairman Mao said: "Rich peasants generally own relatively abundant means of production and working capital." The "household with three horses, one plow, and one cart" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about is a genuine rich peasant. A paper lantern pierced with a needle will reveal the truth. The Chinese Khrushchev relies on "households with three horses, one plow, and one cart" to establish "collective farms," which means relying on rich peasants to promote capitalism and not allowing us poor and lower-middle peasants to promote socialism.

We poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited in the old society, suffering deeply. After liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants have stood up politically, taken control, and received land. However, to completely get rid of the poverty and bankruptcy of our ancestors, relying on individual households is not enough; we must organize and walk the bright path of socialism. As Chairman Mao said, "Apart from socialism, there is no other way out." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, over the past decade, we poor and lower-middle peasants have organized mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and in 1958, we embarked on the bridge to communism—the people's commune. We poor and lower-middle peasants have followed Chairman Mao to walk the socialist path for more than a decade, knowing the benefits of cooperation most deeply and seeing the harm of the rich peasant economy most clearly. The socialist path, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely walk!

The Chinese Khrushchev Will Never Find an Opportunity to Restore the Old System

Sten Regency added: I would like to add a few more words. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the development of the rich peasant economy, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. This is a pipe dream and will never succeed.

We poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao more than our parents. In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works at home, especially studying the "Three Articles" well, and promoting the revolutionization of our thinking. The most poisonous trick of the Chinese Khrushchev is to use the bourgeois "self" to seduce us poor and lower-middle peasants to walk the capitalist road. We must take "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the key, carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, severely criticize the "self" in our minds, establish a proletarian worldview, and not give the Chinese Khrushchev any opportunity to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat; they will make their last struggle." We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly, eliminate all his poison, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy the rural battlefield.

    社会主义的光明大道我们走定了
    ——沈庆元一家狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹发展富农经济的谬论
    吃过夜饭，第五生产队贫农社员沈庆元一家，个个手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫发展富农经济的罪行。家庭批判会在朗读毛主席语录声中开始。
    中国赫鲁晓夫爱的是地主富农
    沈庆元首先发言：中国的赫鲁晓夫拆集体经济的台，挖社会主义的墙脚，长期以来鼓吹发展富农经济，胡说什么“剥削有功”，“剥削是救人”，“要欢迎剥削”，“有了百分之七十有三匹马的农户，将来才好搞集体农庄。”这真是屎克螂打呵欠——满嘴臭气。十几年来，中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行了一条复辟资本主义的路线。今天晚上，我们开个家庭批判会，先批判他的发展富农经济的谬论。
    沈王大（沈庆元母亲）接着说：中国赫鲁晓夫叫喊什么“剥削有功”，“剥削是救人”，这完全是鬼话。一提起剥削，我就怒火万丈，解放前的阶级苦难又涌上心头。我十三岁起就给地主富农打短工，整整打了二十六年。要不是解放，我打短工的日子那里有个尽头？打短工日子真苦煞啊！二十二岁上，我养了个囡，养下来才十三天，我就下田给地主富农卖命，汗水落在地主田里，眼泪淌在自己肚里。我的第二个小囡，因为家里吃不上饭，刚生下来，就被活活地闷死了。第三个小囡生下不久，也送给人家做童养媳了。旧社会租重、税多、利钱高，穷人面前只有三条路：挨饿、上吊、坐监牢。
    我们贫下中农的死对头中国赫鲁晓夫，睁着眼睛说瞎话，胡说“剥削有功”“剥削是救人”，他长的是什么心肝！我们要问中国赫鲁晓夫：你救的是什么人？你救的是地主富农。
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，毛主席他老人家是我们贫下中农的大恩人。毛主席把我们从旧社会的苦海中救出来，领导我们组织起来走集体化道路，我们翻了身，当了家，作了主。我们的生活好象倒吃甘蔗，一节比一节甜。现在装了广播喇叭，我年纪大，在家里就能听到国家大事。过去车水犁田，脱粒挑担，田里生活那一件不用人力。公社化以后，在工人阶级的支援下，我们大队实现了灌溉、脱粒电气化，耕田机械化，不怕旱，不怕涝，年年大丰收。要不是毛主席他老人家，那里有今天啊！
    中国赫鲁晓夫靠的是地主富农
    肖凤娥（沈庆元爱人、贫农女社员）说：中国赫鲁晓夫，这个地主富农的孝子贤孙，胡说什么“有了百分之七十有三匹马的农户，将来才好搞集体农庄。”这是那一个阶级的话！什么“三马一犁一车的农户”？我们翻开毛主席的光辉著作《怎样分析农村阶级》一看就很清楚。毛主席说：“富农一般都占有比较优裕的生产工具和活动资本”。中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“三马一犁一车的农户”就是地地道道的富农。纸糊的灯笼一戳就穿。中国赫鲁晓夫依靠“三马一犁一车的农户”搞“集体农庄”，就是依靠富农搞资本主义，不准我们贫下中农搞社会主义。
    我们贫下中农在旧社会受压迫，受剥削，苦大仇深。解放了，我们贫下中农政治上翻了身，掌了印把子，分到了土地，但是要彻底摆脱祖祖辈辈的贫困和破产，靠一家一户是不行的，只有组织起来，走社会主义光明大道。正如毛主席说的“除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”在毛主席他老人家的领导下，十几年来，我们贫下中农组织了互助组、初级社、高级社，一九五八年又走上通向共产主义的天桥——人民公社。我们贫下中农跟着毛主席走社会主义道路十多年了，对合作化的好处知道得最深，对富农经济的坏处看得最清，社会主义道路我们贫下中农走定了！
    中国赫鲁晓夫休想找到复辟的空子
    沈庆元最后说：我再补充几句。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹发展富农经济，就是妄想在农村复辟资本主义。这是白日做梦，永远办不到。
    我们贫下中农对毛主席亲上加亲，对中国赫鲁晓夫恨上加恨。今后，我们家庭里要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，特别要把“老三篇”学好，搞好思想革命化。中国的赫鲁晓夫最毒的一手，就是用资产阶级的“私”字来引诱我们贫下中农走资本主义道路。我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处闹革命，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，树立无产阶级世界观，叫中国赫鲁晓夫找不到复辟资本主义的空子。
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他的一切流毒，让伟大的毛泽东思想牢牢占领农村阵地。
