The brave and skilled patriotic military and people of Laos' Luang Prabang Province, on the night of January 14, launched a fierce offensive and fiercely attacked the right-wing army of Laos stationed in the Nam Bao area. They annihilated more than 700 enemy soldiers in one battle, liberated the important strategic area of Nam Bao, and forced the remaining enemy to flee in all directions from Nam Bao.

During the battle, the local patriotic military and people also seized nearly 160 pieces of artillery and light and heavy machine guns of various calibers, as well as a large amount of military supplies.

Nam Bao is a strategic stronghold in northern Luang Prabang. Before June 24, 1962, it had been liberated by the patriotic armed forces of Laos. Since July 1, 1966, the United States and the puppet regime in Vientiane have openly used aircraft to drop large numbers of enemy troops, illegally occupying Nam Bao and carrying out looting and massacres against the local people.

The patriotic military and people of Laos are extremely indignant at the savage crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys. In response to the new battle call issued by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, on January 6 of this year, to foil the enemy's plan to "eat away" at the liberated areas, the patriotic military and people of Laos launched a siege and attack on the Nam Bao area, achieving the above-mentioned brilliant victory.

The patriotic military and people of Laos' Luang Prabang Province's Muan Ai County, from December 31 last year to January 12 this year, repeatedly foiled the attacks of the right-wing army of Vientiane, killing and wounding 152 enemy soldiers, and seizing a large amount of weapons and other military supplies.

The patriotic military and people of Laos' Luang Prabang Province shot down one American aggressor aircraft in the Nam Bao area on January 13.

The patriotic armed forces of Laos' Khammouane Province shot down one American F-105 jet aircraft on December 30 last year. On November 17 last year, the patriotic military and people of Laos also shot down one American aggressor aircraft in the western region of Vientiane.

The patriotic military and people of Laos' Khammouane Province bravely attacked the enemy on January 3, achieving a new victory of annihilating nearly 100 enemy soldiers.

The report said that on January 3, American aggressors and their lackeys sent helicopters to drop two battalions of right-wing troops into the 30th hill of Khammouane Province, attempting to "eat away" and attack the Falang area. However, as soon as these enemy troops got off the plane, they were met with a fierce counterattack by the well-prepared patriotic military and people of Khammouane Province, annihilating 98 enemy soldiers on the spot. The remaining enemy soldiers were terrified and fled in all directions. According to another report, the guerrilla forces and local troops of Vientiane, Saravane, Pakse, and Attapeu provinces, during the mid-to-late December last year, launched a series of proactive attacks, cleverly and bravely striking the enemy, killing more than 60 enemy soldiers, destroying two military vehicles, and seizing a large number of weapons and military supplies.

    以凌厉的攻势猛袭右派军队　粉碎敌人“蚕食”解放区阴谋
    老挝爱国军民解放战略要地南博
    川圹等省爱国军民主动出击不断取得新胜利
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：英勇善战的老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民，一月十四日夜间，以凌厉的攻势，猛烈袭击盘踞在南博地区的老挝右派军队，一举歼灭敌人七百多名，解放了南博这个重要的战略地区，迫使残敌全部从南博四散逃窜。
    在战斗中，当地爱国军民还缴获各种口径的大炮和轻重机枪等武器近一百六十件，以及大批的军用物资。
    南博地区是琅勃拉邦北部的一个战略要地，在一九六二年六月二十四日以前早被老挝爱国武装力量解放。从一九六六年七月一日以来，美国和万象傀儡当局公然使用飞机投下大批敌人，非法占领南博，并对当地人民实行抢劫和屠杀。
    老挝爱国军民对美帝国主义及其仆从的野蛮罪行十分愤慨。为了响应老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王今年一月六日发出的新的战斗号召，粉碎敌人“蚕食”解放区的阴谋，老挝爱国军民对南博地区进行了包围和袭击，取得了上述辉煌的胜利。
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝琅勃拉邦省芒艾县爱国军民，从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月十二日，多次粉碎了万象右派军队的进攻，打死打伤敌军一百五十二名，缴获了大量武器和其他军事物资。
    新华社康开十七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民一月十三日在南博地区击落美国强盗飞机一架。
    新华社康开十六日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝川圹省爱国武装力量，去年十二月三十日击落美国F—105型喷气式飞机一架。去年十一月十七日，老挝爱国军民在万象西部地区，也曾击落美国强盗飞机一架。
    新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝川圹省爱国军民三日英勇袭击敌人，取得歼敌近一百名的新胜利。
    报道说，一月三日，美国强盗及其走狗出动直升飞机把两营右派军队空投到川圹省第三○号高地，企图“蚕食”进攻法琅地区。但是，当这批敌人刚从飞机上下来，就遭到严阵以待的川圹省爱国军民的迎头痛击，当场歼敌九十八名。残存的敌人惊恐万状，四散逃窜。另据报道，万象、沙拉湾、巴色和阿速坡四省游击队和地方部队，在去年十二月中、下旬期间，接连主动出击，机智勇敢地打击敌人，共消灭敌人六十多名，击毁军车两辆，缴获一大批武器和军用物资。（附图片）
