In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the first synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant in Shandong Province, with an annual production capacity of 45,000 tons, the Jinan Fertilizer Plant, has recently been completed and put into production.

Synthetic ammonia plays a very important role in China's chemical fertilizer industry. It is used to process ammonia water, ammonium bicarbonate, and chemical fertilizers, with low costs and significant effects.

During the construction of the plant, the broad revolutionary workers followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "saving every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction." They actively proposed rational suggestions and paid attention to saving every bit. The ammonia water storage tanks of this plant were originally designed to be three, but after joint research by veteran workers and technicians, it was decided to change to two, under the principle of not affecting technical requirements. This alone saved the country more than nine tons of steel.

    山东省第一座合成氨化肥厂建成
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，山东省第一座年产四万五千吨合成氨的济南化肥厂，最近建成投入生产。
    合成氨在我国化学肥料工业中占有很重要的地位，用它加工制作氨水、碳酸氢氨和化学肥料，成本低，肥效显著。
    在建厂过程中，广大革命职工遵照毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”的教导，大提合理化建议，注意点滴节约。这个厂的氨水储罐原来设计了三个，后来经过老工人、技术员等共同研究，决定在不影响技术要求的原则下改为两个，仅此一项即为国家节约了九吨多钢材。
