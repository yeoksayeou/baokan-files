In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has already achieved decisive victories and is now on the cusp of a comprehensive victory, and in the midst of a great situation nationwide and in Shanghai, the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* have published the important editorial "Greeting the Comprehensive Victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is a highly important document. It conveys the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, serving as a new battle mobilization order from the proletarian headquarters to the entire Party, the entire army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide, and the people nationwide. It is a programmatic document for carrying out the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1968. This document points out the direction for our advance.

We must earnestly study this important document. Revolutionary committees at all levels and revolutionary mass organizations must promptly take up the study. Whether or not we earnestly study this important document and whether or not we put what we learn into practice are matters of our attitude towards the proletarian headquarters.

Study must be guaranteed a certain amount of time. We must study earnestly and sit down to study. We must ensure that every unit and every revolutionary mass organization can clearly understand the combat tasks for the glorious year 1968. We must continue to vigorously establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Each unit can, according to specific circumstances, adopt various forms, primarily focusing on extracurricular activities.

In studying this important document, we must promote the revolutionary study style of linking theory with practice. We must study with questions in mind and address the pressing issues that need to be resolved. We must comprehensively and deeply grasp the spirit of this document and, through study, promote the work of each unit. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses on all fronts must ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented, promptly implemented, and strictly followed, with each sentence being followed to the letter.

In studying this important document, each unit and revolutionary mass organization must, in accordance with the spirit of the editorial, earnestly summarize the experiences of various works since the "January Revolution," achieving "discovery, invention, creation, and progress." We must focus on summarizing experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Through summarization, we must understand the situation, identify gaps, clarify tasks, and promote the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, achieving new merits for the people in the new year.

    狠抓大学习
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利，正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，在全国、上海一片大好形势下，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表了《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》的重要社论。这是一个极为重要的文件。它传达了伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，是毛主席的无产阶级司令部向全党、全军、全国无产阶级革命派和全国人民发出的一个新的战斗动员令，是一九六八年开展无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。这个文件给我们指明了前进的航程。
    我们必须认真学习这个重要文件。各级革命委员会、各革命群众组织应该雷厉风行地把学习抓起来。是不是认真学好这个重要文件，学了是不是见诸行动，这是对无产阶级司令部的态度问题。
    学习必须有一定的时间保证。要认真地学，要坐下来学。务必使每一个单位、每一个革命群众组织都能够明确在光辉的一九六八年的战斗任务。继续大办特办、努力办好毛泽东思想学习班。办毛泽东思想学习班，各单位可以根据具体情况，采用多种形式，坚持以业余为主。
    学习这个重要文件，要发扬理论联系实际的革命学风。要带着问题学，要带着当前迫切需要解决的问题来学。既要全面深刻地领会这个文件的精神，又要通过学习推动本单位的工作。各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众对毛主席的最新指示，必须做到条条落实、全面落实、坚决照办、句句照办，落实得越快越好。
    各单位、各革命群众组织在学习这个重要文件时，要根据社论精神，认真总结“一月革命”以来各项工作的经验，做到“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。要着重总结落实毛主席最新指示、紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署方面的经验。通过总结，认清形势，找出差距，明确任务，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，在新的一年中为人民立新功。
