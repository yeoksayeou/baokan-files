In the unprecedentedly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, news from the world's highest peak is inspiring: Chinese revolutionary scientists have, for the first time, conducted a large-scale, multidisciplinary scientific expedition in the Mount Everest region, obtaining extremely valuable scientific data and achieving a brilliant victory. This is a magnificent ode to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the annals of human science, and another bountiful fruit of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We hereby express our profound respect to the revolutionary scientists fighting on the "Roof of the World," as well as the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, and Tibetan laborers who supported and assisted this scientific expedition.

"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the fierce class struggle, we must rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the arduous struggle against nature, we must also rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Our revolutionary scientists were able to complete this comprehensive scientific expedition under extremely difficult conditions, traversing snow-capped mountains and ice peaks, precisely because they were able to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in all circumstances, drawing boundless strength from Chairman Mao's teachings.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. As long as we resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summon our courage, strive for the forefront, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war, we will definitely achieve even more brilliant victories in the revolution and production! We will definitely make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments, catch up with and surpass the world's advanced scientific and technological level, and make even greater contributions to the people of our country and the world!

In the realms of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is constantly evolving, never stopping at a single level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress.

The Bountiful Fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: An Unprecedented Great Feat in Human Scientific History

Mao Zedong Thought Guides Revolutionary Scientists to Conquer the Peak

The Triumphant Success of the Multidisciplinary Scientific Expedition to Mount Everest

More than a hundred scientists from nearly thirty disciplines, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, and Tibetan laborers, conducted a comprehensive, systematic, multidisciplinary scientific expedition in the Mount Everest region, reaching altitudes of over seven thousand meters. They obtained a series of relatively complete and important scientific data, surpassing the world's advanced level in many aspects. This is something that no imperialist or modern revisionist country's scientific endeavors can match. This expedition once again convincingly proves that Chairman Mao's brilliant dialectical materialist thought is an unshakable great truth!

New China News Agency, January 17th: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, our revolutionary scientists, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, and Tibetan laborers, conducted a large-scale, multidisciplinary scientific expedition in the Mount Everest region, achieving brilliant results. This unprecedented great feat in human scientific history is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Mount Everest stands majestically on the Himalayan mountain range in our southwestern border, the highest peak in the world. Due to the region's abundant natural resources, unique geographical location, and natural characteristics, it has a significant impact on human life and the natural environment. This region is also key to solving many major scientific problems. Therefore, it has long been a focus of attention. Over the past century, various imperialist countries have been eager to send so-called "explorers" to "expeditions," attempting to plunder this region. However, due to Mount Everest's unparalleled height, unpredictable weather, and extremely treacherous terrain, as well as the decadence of the capitalist system and the ugly souls of the so-called "explorers" from imperialist countries, some of them perished in the eternal ice and snow, never to return; others conducted small-scale theft, obtaining a few bits of data, making many absurd, idealist, and metaphysical conclusions, and deceiving people everywhere. Over the long years, the true scientific face of Mount Everest has remained unclear. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our revolutionary scientists, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have conducted scientific expeditions to Mount Everest. In 1960, young Chinese mountaineers first ascended the summit of Mount Everest from the north slope and conducted scientific expedition activities. However, due to the frenzied promotion of the revisionist research line of servility, crawling, and abolitionism by the clique of traitors and renegades within the party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and the efforts of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" to seize personal fame and profit, they tried in every possible way to smuggle in their junk, both openly and covertly, greatly affecting the scientific expedition work in this region.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly smashed the rule of a handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," cutting off their black hands in the field of scientific expeditions. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of summoning courage, striving for the forefront, self-reliance, diligence and thrift, and striving for progress, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army and local Tibetan laborers, revolutionary scientists from various relevant fields implemented a multi-force joint operation. With a fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, they overcame countless difficulties and finally conquered this peak known as "even birds cannot fly over," the world's highest peak.

In 1966 and 1967, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was vigorously carried out in our country, the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized a large-scale comprehensive scientific expedition team consisting of nearly three dozen disciplines and more than a hundred scientists from twenty-three research institutions, universities, industrial departments, and the military's research system. They conducted a comprehensive, systematic, multidisciplinary scientific expedition in the Mount Everest region, covering an area of over fifty thousand square kilometers south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, from the east of Gyirong to the west of Jilong, with altitudes reaching over seven thousand meters. The expedition covered: stratigraphy, paleontology, petrology, structural geology, Quaternary geology and geomorphology, geophysics, natural geography, surface geochemistry, soil science, plant ecology, plant systematics, birds and beasts, insects, aquatic organisms, glaciers, meteorology, hydrology, astronomy, geodesy, aerial photogrammetry, high-altitude physiology, and more. Through these expeditions, a large amount of scientific data was obtained regarding how the Himalayas and Mount Everest transformed from sea to high mountains and their impact on the natural world and human activities. This provides reliable scientific basis for the future development and utilization of Tibet's natural resources and socialist construction. A large amount of irrefutable data not only refuted the absurd, idealist, and metaphysical conclusions made by imperialist "explorers" about this region but also once again convincingly proved that the brilliant dialectical materialist thought proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, "In the realms of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is constantly evolving, never stopping at a single level," is an unshakable great truth.

Our revolutionary geologists, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, daring to think and act, and forging our own path, for the first time discovered early Paleozoic strata dating back approximately four hundred million years in the middle section of the Himalayas within our borders. They found a large number of fossils such as graptolites, trilobites, and ammonites, refuting the erroneous conclusions made by foreigners that this region might not have early Paleozoic strata, providing a scientific basis for understanding the geological history of the broad region from Gyirong to Yadong south of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Geologists also discovered ichthyosaur fossils in the Triassic strata dating back approximately one hundred and eighty million years. These discoveries are of great significance for the comprehensive study of the geological development history of the Himalayas and Mount Everest, mineral prospecting, and production and construction. In this expedition, scientists studying Quaternary geology and geomorphology also conducted extensive research on the geological characteristics and crustal movement laws of the Mount Everest region over the past million years. In the many Quaternary deposits between four thousand three hundred meters and five thousand meters in the middle section of the Himalayas within our borders, they found plant fossils such as rhododendrons, buckthorns, willows, roses, and honeysuckles, and animal fossils such as marmots, deer, rabbits, and rodents, as well as new stone tools. These expedition results are of great value for understanding the uplift amplitude of the Himalayas and Mount Everest over the past million years, climate changes, and human activities. Scientists in natural geography, surface geochemistry, soil science, botany, zoology, and other fields collaborated to conduct comprehensive research on the complex natural zonation phenomena in the Mount Everest region and explored the distribution patterns of the world's highest cultivated land and pastures.

Scientists in geophysics, high-altitude radiation, surveying, meteorology, glaciers, high-altitude physiology, and other fields, with the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan laborers, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, endured hardships and labored tirelessly, with unyielding revolutionary will, overcame the numerous difficulties of high-altitude hypoxia and severe wind and snow, and successfully completed their expedition tasks. In the fields of geomagnetism and gravity, the results of this expedition, both in quantity and quality, far surpassed the world's advanced level. Through the expedition, we not only gained a relatively complete understanding of the distribution and characteristics of geomagnetism and gravity in the Mount Everest region but also obtained geomagnetic and gravity data at an altitude of six thousand five hundred meters, the highest point in the history of global geomagnetic surveys. These expedition results have greatly promoted the development of geomagnetic and gravity science research in our country. Scientists conducting solar radiation surveys, with the determination to plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the world's highest peak, fearlessly faced the high mountains and long distances, overcame the physical exhaustion brought by low temperatures and hypoxia, and fought tenaciously against high-altitude reactions in extremely harsh environments, obtaining a series of extremely valuable firsthand solar radiation data from altitudes of five thousand to seven thousand meters on Mount Everest.

These data far surpassed the data stolen by American imperialists in 1963 when they secretly climbed to just below six thousand meters from the south slope, occupying a position in the field of high-altitude solar radiation research for our country. Young surveyors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," engaged in a relentless struggle with nature on the world's highest peak. They fearlessly faced the severe wind and snow, thin air, and carried several dozen kilograms of surveying instruments, conducting astronomical, triangulation, leveling, and aerial photogrammetry surveys, creating an unprecedented miracle in the history of global surveying.

Other scientists in meteorology, glaciers, high-altitude physiology, and other fields also resolutely followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," overcoming all difficulties, traversing snow-capped mountains and ice peaks, and obtaining rich data in the aforementioned research fields on the world's highest peak.

In the first large-scale, multidisciplinary scientific expedition to the Mount Everest region, scientists from various disciplines implemented communist-style cooperation, and the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers, as well as local Tibetan laborers, provided strong support and assistance. All comrades participating in this scientific expedition, for a common revolutionary goal, came from all directions, always, in all matters, and in all places, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, overcoming one difficulty after another on the road to progress, achieving one victory after another. They held study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works by the Yarlung Zangbo River, in the ice tower forests of Mount Everest, and at campsites several thousand meters high, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, drawing boundless wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's teachings. They said, following Chairman Mao's words, we will definitely overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve the final victory. Acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely conquer the world's highest scientific peak. We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guiding our path, and the superior socialist system, which is why we can conduct such large-scale, planned scientific expeditions full of revolutionary spirit, making rapid progress in understanding and transforming nature. This is something that no imperialist or modern revisionist country's scientific endeavors can match. Our revolutionary scientists, under extremely harsh conditions, completed the large-scale scientific expedition to the world's highest peak in a relatively short time, writing a brilliant chapter of Mao Zedong Thought's victory in human scientific history. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the path of our revolutionary scientists, leading them from one victory to another, from one scientific and technological peak to another.

    无产阶级文化大革命丰硕成果　人类科学史上空前伟大创举
    毛泽东思想指引革命科学工作者攀登高峰
    珠穆朗玛峰多学科科学考察取得辉煌胜利
    近三十个学科的一百多名科学工作者，在人民解放军、革命工人和藏族劳动人民大力支持和协助下，实行多兵种联合作战，对珠穆朗玛峰海拔最高达七千多米的地区进行了全面、系统的综合科学考察，获得了一系列较完整、重要的科学资料，许多方面都超过了世界先进水平。这是任何帝国主义、现代修正主义国家的科学事业所不能比拟的。这次考察，再一次雄辩地证实，毛主席的辩证唯物主义光辉思想，是颠扑不破的伟大真理！
    新华社十七日讯　在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国革命科学工作者在人民解放军、革命工人和藏族劳动人民大力支持协助下，对珠穆朗玛峰地区进行了大规模多学科的科学考察，取得了辉煌成果。人类科学史上这一空前伟大创举，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    珠穆朗玛峰，巍然耸立在我国西南边疆喜马拉雅山山脉的群峰之上，是世界第一高峰。由于这个地区蕴藏着极为富饶的自然资源，有独特的地理位置和自然特点，对人类生活和自然环境有重大影响。这个地区又是解决许多重大科学问题的关键地区。因此，很久以来就为人们所重视。百余年来，各帝国主义国家都对它野心勃勃，别有用心地纷纷派遣所谓“探险家”来“考察”，企图对这个地区进行掠夺。但是，由于珠穆朗玛峰举世无双的高度，变幻莫测的气候和极端险恶的地形，特别是资本主义制度的腐朽性和帝国主义国家的所谓“探险家”的丑恶灵魂，他们中，有的人葬身于万年冰雪之中，再也没有回去；有的进行了小股盗窃活动，获得了一星半点的资料，作出了不少唯心主义、形而上学的荒谬论断，到处招摇撞骗。在过去漫长的年代里，珠穆朗玛峰在科学上的本来面目一直不清。中华人民共和国成立以来，我国革命的科学工作者在毛主席革命路线的指引下，对珠穆朗玛峰进行过科学考察。一九六○年年青的中国登山队员第一次从北坡登上了珠穆朗玛峰顶峰，并进行了科学考察活动。但是，由于以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在科学技术界的代理人疯狂推行奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的修正主义科研路线，资产阶级反动学术“权威”为窃取个人名利，也纷纷以公开或隐蔽的形式千方百计把他们的黑货塞进来，使这个地区的科学考察工作受到了很大影响。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命彻底摧毁了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”的统治，斩断了他们伸向科学考察方面的黑手。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在毛主席的鼓足干劲，力争上游，自力更生，奋发图强，树雄心，立壮志，赶超世界先进科学技术水平的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在人民解放军和当地藏族劳动人民的大力支持和协助下，各有关方面的革命科学工作者实行多兵种联合作战，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，排除万难，终于征服了这座被称为“连飞鸟也无法越过”的世界第一高峰。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地进行的一九六六年和一九六七年，由中国科学院组织，全国二十三个科研单位、高等院校、产业部门和解放军科研系统，有近三十个学科的一百多名科学工作者，组成大规模的综合科学考察队，在雅鲁藏布江以南，东起亚东西至吉隆，方圆五万多平方公里，海拔最高达七千多米的珠穆朗玛峰地区进行了全面、系统的综合科学考察。考察的内容包括：地层、古生物、岩石、构造地质、第四纪地质与地貌、地球物理、自然地理、表生地球化学、土壤、植物生态、区系植物、鸟兽、昆虫、水生生物、冰川、气象、水文、天文大地测量、地面立体摄影测量、高山生理等。通过上述考察，获得了大量有关喜马拉雅山和珠穆朗玛峰是怎样由沧海变成高山，及其对自然界和人类活动影响的一系列较完整、重要的科学资料，为今后西藏自然资源的开发利用和社会主义建设提供了可靠的科学依据。大量无可辩驳的资料不仅有力地推翻了帝国主义的“探险家”们对这个地区所做的一些唯心主义、形而上学的荒谬论断，而且再一次雄辩地证实，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上”这一辩证唯物主义的光辉思想，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国革命的地质科学工作者，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢干，走自己的路的教导，在喜马拉雅山中段我国境内，首次发现了距今约四亿年前的早古生代地层，找到了笔石、三叶虫、鹦鹉螺等大量化石，推翻了外国人过去提出的这个地区可能没有早古生代地层的错误论断，为人类认识雅鲁藏布江以南吉隆到亚东之间广大地区的地质历史提供了科学根据。地质科学工作者并再次在距今约一亿八千万年前的三叠纪地层中发现了鱼龙化石。上述发现，对今后全面研究喜马拉雅山和珠穆朗玛峰的地质发展历史，普查找矿和生产建设都有重大意义。在这次考察中，从事第四纪地质与地貌方面研究的科学工作者，还对珠穆朗玛峰地区近一百万年以来的地质特征、地壳运动规律进行了大量考察，在喜马拉雅山中段我国境内，海拔四千三百米至五千米之间的许多第四纪沉积物中，找到了杜鹃、荚蒾、柳树、蔷薇、忍冬等植物化石，旱獭、鹿、兔、鼠等动物化石和新石器等。这些考察成果对于了解喜马拉雅山和珠穆朗玛峰近一百万年以来的上升幅度、气候的变迁和人类活动的情况都有很大价值。自然地理、表生地球化学、土壤、植物、动物等方面的科学工作者互相协作，对珠穆朗玛峰地区复杂的自然分带现象进行了综合的研究，并对世界最高耕地和牧场的分布规律作了探讨。
    地球物理、高山辐射、测绘、气象、冰川、高山生理等方面的科学考察队员们，在人民解放军和藏族劳动人民的大力协助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，吃大苦，耐大劳，以坚韧不拔的革命意志，战胜了高山缺氧和风雪严寒等重重困难，胜利地完成了考察任务。在地磁与重力方面，这次取得的考察成果，无论是在数量上和质量上，都大大超过了世界先进水平。通过考察，不仅对珠穆朗玛峰地区的地磁与重力的分布及特点，有了较完整的了解，而且取得了海拔高达六千五百米的地磁与重力资料，这是世界地磁测量史上最高点的地磁资料。这些考察成果有力地促进了我国地磁与重力科学研究的发展。从事太阳辐射考察的科学工作者，满怀着一定要让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插上世界最高峰的雄心壮志，不怕山高路远，低温缺氧，克服了体力上极大消耗带来的困难，与高山反应作了顽强的斗争，在极其艰苦的环境中，取得了珠穆朗玛峰海拔五千米至七千米以上地带的一系列太阳辐射的极为宝贵的第一手资料。
    这些资料，远远超过了美帝国主义分子一九六三年偷偷从南坡爬到不到六千米的地方所窃取的资料，为我国在高山太阳辐射的研究领域中占领了阵地。用毛泽东思想武装起来的年青的测绘工作者，遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，在世界最高峰同大自然展开了一场艰苦卓绝的搏斗。他们不畏风雪严寒，空气稀薄，背着几十公斤重的测量仪器，进行了天文、三角、水准、地面立体摄影等测量工作，创造了世界测绘史上空前未有的奇迹。
    其他如气象、冰川、高山生理等方面的科学考察工作者，也坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，排除万难，走遍雪山冰峰，在世界最高峰的上述研究领域中，取得了丰富的资料。
    在珠穆朗玛峰地区第一次大规模多学科科学考察工作中，各学科的科学工作者实行了共产主义大协作，人民解放军和革命工人、当地藏族劳动人民给予了大力支持和协助。参加这项科学考察工作的全体同志，为了一个共同的革命目标，从四面八方来到一起，时时、事事、处处坚持活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，克服了前进道路上一个又一个困难，取得了一个又一个胜利。他们在雅鲁藏布江畔，在珠穆朗玛峰的冰塔林里，在海拔数千米的宿营地上，举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，斗私批修，从毛主席的教导中汲取了无穷的智慧和力量。他们说，听毛主席的话，就一定能战胜种种艰难险阻，取得最后胜利。照毛主席的指示办事，就一定能攀登上世界科学最高峰。我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引着前进的道路，有优越的社会主义制度，才有可能进行这样充满革命精神的大规模的、有计划的科学考察工作，在认识自然、改造自然的进军中迅猛迈进。这是任何帝国主义、现代修正主义国家的科学事业所不能比拟的。我国革命科学工作者在极端艰苦的条件下，以较短的时间，胜利完成了世界第一高峰的大规模科学考察工作，在人类科学史上写下了光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌。毛泽东思想的光辉永远照耀着我国革命科学工作者前进的道路，使他们从胜利走向更大的胜利，从一个科学技术高峰攀登上另一个科学技术高峰！（附图片）
