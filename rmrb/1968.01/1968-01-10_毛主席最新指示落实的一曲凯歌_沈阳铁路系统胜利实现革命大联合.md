	Editor's Note: In the radiant year of 1968, the Shenyang Railway System swiftly achieved revolutionary great unity. This is a concrete action taken by the revolutionary railway workers in the Shenyang area to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have set an example for promoting revolutionary great unity in all sectors of the Shenyang area. We extend our warmest congratulations to them!

	Transportation is the lifeline of the national economy. It plays a crucial role in developing agriculture and industry, ensuring people's livelihood, strengthening national defense, and advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, vigorously promoting transportation is an important task in implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	All revolutionary railway workers across the country should, in the process of accomplishing the five major tasks for this great year, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote, consolidate, and develop revolutionary great unity, achieve revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out revolutionary criticism and rectification within the unit, and better grasp revolution and promote production, economize for revolution, and strive to be models of guarding work posts, observing labor discipline, cherishing state property, and fulfilling state plans.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 9th: The revolutionary masses of the Shenyang Railway System, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have achieved revolutionary great unity with concrete actions, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and have struck the first triumphant note for 1968.

	On the 8th, representatives of the three major mass organizations of the Shenyang Railway System and the mass organizations of the Changchun, Dalian, and Dandong railway departments under the Shenyang Railway Bureau gathered at the Shenyang Station Square, filled with boundless excitement, to hold a grand meeting to celebrate the achievement of revolutionary great unity in the Shenyang Railway System. At the meeting, they expressed their determination to continue their efforts, further promote the realization of comprehensive, systematic, and departmental revolutionary great unity throughout the system, complete the five major tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The meeting read out a congratulatory telegram from the State Council. During the reading of the telegram, the entire audience repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" They said, "We must follow the great leader Chairman Mao even more closely and swear to be revolutionary cadres of the proletariat who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

	The Shenyang Railway Bureau is one of the railway bureaus in the country with a relatively large volume of transportation and a relatively large number of personnel. It undertakes the important transportation tasks of the northeastern industrial base of our country. Under the radiant guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, and inspired by the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the three factions of the Shenyang Railway System reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary great unity at the end of last year. At the beginning of the radiant year of 1968, the entire system quickly formed a high tide of revolutionary great unity. Currently, the majority of the grassroots units under the Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, and Dandong divisions of the Shenyang Railway Bureau have successively reached unity agreements, promoting a very good situation for revolution and production throughout the system, which is getting better and better.

	On the 8th, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participated in the celebration meeting. They braved the biting cold, holding high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly shouting: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! Long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, for ten thousand years! For ten thousand years!"

	Leaders of the Shenyang Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Liaoning Military District, and other relevant units all attended the meeting to express their warm congratulations. The leader of the Shenyang Command, Yang Di, highly praised the revolutionary great unity of the three factions of the Shenyang Railway System, which has set an example for the revolutionary mass organizations in the Shenyang area. It will strongly promote the arrival of the high tide of revolutionary great unity in the Shenyang area.

	At the meeting, the three major organizations of the Shenyang Railway System jointly stated: We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, redouble our efforts, strive for the best, and continue to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. The joint statement emphasized the need to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, consolidate revolutionary great unity, and actively promote revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination by system, department, and team, carry out criticism and rectification within the unit, and launch a new high tide of "supporting the army and loving the people," actively support and assist the Shenyang garrison in doing a good job of "three supports and two militaries" and protecting the railway, and timely expose and smash the sabotage activities of the class enemy. The joint statement expressed the determination to more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," adhere to part-time revolution, economize for revolution, and revolutionize on the spot, guard work posts, observe labor discipline, cherish state property, and strive for victory in both revolution and transportation production.

	The meeting, amidst thunderous applause, passed a telegram of respect to our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao.

	The meeting also passed an appeal, calling on the various factions of the Shenyang masses to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and promote and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in Liaoning.
