A Soviet citizen shouted the voice of the broad masses of the Soviet people in public: Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

New China News Agency, January 13th: Moscow reports: On the afternoon of January 10th, an unarmed middle-aged Soviet citizen, despite the strong force of the Soviet revisionist police, fearlessly shouted in public in Moscow:

"Down with Soviet modern revisionism!"

This brave Soviet citizen's righteous and stern voice expressed the voice of the broad masses of the Soviet people.

According to reports, around 6:50 PM that afternoon, at the famous Yaroslavl Railway Station in Moscow, people saw this Soviet citizen being dragged out of the station by two Soviet revisionist police officers, with another police officer following behind to "reinforce." This Soviet citizen, fearless of violence and sacrifice, shouted loudly to the crowd present: "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" Immediately, the Soviet revisionist police panicked, hurriedly dragging him away tightly and shouting, "Don't shout, don't shout." However, this middle-aged Soviet citizen was fearless, continuing to shout the slogan as he walked.

This incident shows that the broad masses of the Soviet people have increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance towards the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, which has thoroughly betrayed Marxism-Leninism. No matter how cruel the fascist suppression methods adopted by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, they cannot suppress the revolutionary Soviet people.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good, they want revolution, the rule of the revisionists will not last long." Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Soviet people will surely break through all obstacles and thoroughly bury the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

    苏联一公民在大庭广众喊出广大苏联人民的心声：
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    新华社十三日讯　莫斯科消息：一月十日下午，一位赤手空拳的苏联中年人，在苏修警察的强力绑架之下，不顾生命的危险，在莫斯科大庭广众之中，满腔愤怒地高呼：
  “打倒苏联现代修正主义！”这位勇敢的苏联公民的义正辞严的声音，喊出了广大苏联人民的心声。
    据报道，这天下午六时五十分左右，在莫斯科有名的雅罗斯拉夫火车站上，人们看到这位苏联公民被两名苏修警察架出车站，还有一名警察跟在后面“压阵”。这个苏联人不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，对着在场的群众大声高呼：“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”顿时，苏修警察慌了手脚，连忙把他紧紧架走，并且叫嚷着“不许喊，不许喊”。但是，这位苏联中年人毫不畏惧，边走边继续呼喊口号。
    这一事件表明，广大的苏联人民对于彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义的苏修领导集团，正在表现出越来越强烈的不满和反抗。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流不管采取多么残酷的法西斯镇压手段，都压服不了起来革命的苏联人民。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏联人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，必将冲破一切障碍，彻底埋葬苏修叛徒集团的反动统治。
