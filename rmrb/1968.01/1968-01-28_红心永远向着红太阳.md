A red sun rises high, casting golden rays across the land. Once again, I have seen our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao. Look! Our most revered great leader, Chairman Mao, has entered the reception hall. Everyone instantly felt a radiant red light, making the hall even more brilliant. Blood flows joyfully, and hearts beat fiercely. A thousand words, a million words, all condense into one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao!

On October 1, 1966, I, as a representative of the People's Liberation Army, stood on Tiananmen and saw our great leader, Chairman Mao, for the first time. After returning to the unit, I wore the uniform I had on during the reception and went to every company and every construction site to share this happiest news with my comrades. Later, I washed this uniform clean and carefully wrapped it up. Every time a major revolutionary holiday comes, I put it on, and my whole body is filled with boundless strength. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! To defend you, to defend your brilliant thoughts, to defend your revolutionary line, I dare to climb mountains of swords and cross seas of fire.

When I came to Beijing to attend this representative conference, my fellow soldiers in my platoon held my hands tightly and repeatedly instructed, "When you see Chairman Mao, shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' a thousand times, ten thousand times! Wish Chairman Mao a long, long life!" After arriving in Beijing, I eagerly awaited day and night, often shouting in my dreams, "Chairman Mao has come!" "I have seen Chairman Mao again!" My greatest wish has finally come true. I have seen our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, again. He is in extremely good health, which is our greatest happiness, the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people around the world.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the broad masses of soldiers and officers, love you dearly. It is your great thoughts that have nurtured our growth. It is your great thoughts that make the people of the whole country full of spirit and high morale. It is your great thoughts that point the way forward for all the people of the world. I swear to you: I will study your books diligently, listen to your words carefully, and follow your instructions resolutely. I will definitely implement your latest instructions comprehensively and march forward bravely in the direction you have pointed out.

    红心永远向着红太阳
    第二炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表  张华良
    一轮红日高高升起，金光万道普照大地。我又一次见到了我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席。看啊！我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席走进了接见大厅，大家顿时感到眼前一片红光，大厅更加灿烂辉煌。血液在幸福地奔流，红心在激烈地跳荡。千言万语，汇成一句话，祝福您老人家万寿无疆！
      一九六六年十月一日，我作为解放军观礼代表，在天安门上第一次见到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。回到部队后，我穿着被接见时穿的这身军装，到每个连队，每个工地去，把这个最幸福的消息告诉同志们。以后，我就把这身军装洗得干干净净，好好地包起来。每当重大革命节日，我就把它穿上，浑身增添了无穷的力量。毛主席啊，毛主席！为了保卫您，保卫您的光辉思想，保卫您的革命路线，我刀山敢上，火海敢闯。
    我来北京参加这次代表大会的时候，我们排的同志，紧紧握着我的手，千遍万遍地嘱咐：“见到了毛主席，一定代表我们尽情地高呼毛主席万岁！多多地祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”来到北京以后，我日日盼啊，夜夜想，经常从睡梦中喊出声来：“毛主席来了！”“我又见到了毛主席！”我这个最大的愿望，终于实现了，我又一次看到了最伟大的领袖毛主席，他老人家身体非常非常健康，这是我们最大最大的幸福，是全世界革命人民的最大幸福。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们广大指战员无限热爱您，是您的伟大思想哺育我们成长，是您的伟大思想使全国人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，是您的伟大思想给全世界人民指出了前进的方向。我向您宣誓：您的书我认真地学，您的话我句句听，您的指示我坚决照办。我一定全面落实您的最新指示，朝着您所指引的方向勇猛前进。
