Under the direction and assistance of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionists, the Indian reactionary government, despite the severe economic difficulties at home, continues to frantically increase military spending and expand its military arsenal, further oppressing the already impoverished Indian people.

Recently, the Indian reactionary government obtained the approval of its master, U.S. imperialism, to purchase a batch of Hawk Hunter fighter-bombers from Britain. In late December last year, the Indian Defense Minister revealed that the MiG-type jet fighter factory, built with the help of the Soviet revisionists for the Indian reactionary government, had started production. It is reported that one of the factories is located in Orissa, producing the fuselage; another in Maharashtra, producing the engine; and yet another in Andhra Pradesh, producing missiles for the MiG-type fighters. These factories were all built after the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on China in 1962.

According to the Indian News Agency, the Indian government aimed to expand its air force to forty-five squadrons in 1967. At the same time, the Indian government built more air bases. Previously, U.S. imperialism had reached an agreement with the Indian reactionary government that, if U.S. imperialism deemed it necessary to launch an invasion, it would use the air bases prepared by the Indian reactionary government.

Indian media also revealed that the governments of the United States and India are discussing the completion of a "radar system" project on the Sino-Indian border. This project was built by U.S. imperialism to assist the Indian reactionary government after the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on China in 1962. This is clearly a military project to facilitate the aggressive actions of U.S. and Indian air forces.

In November last year, the Indian Defense Minister loudly proclaimed that India needed submarines to "strengthen its defense." At this time, Indian media revealed that four submarines supplied by the Soviet revisionists to the Indian reactionary government were about to join the Indian fleet.

The purpose of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in directing the Indian reactionaries to expand their military arsenal is, on the one hand, to further incite the Indian reactionary government to oppose China and suppress the liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples; on the other hand, to exploit the Indian people through increased military spending by the Indian reactionary government. Since the Indian reactionary government launched armed attacks on China and Pakistan, the Indian government's annual military expenditure has soared from less than 3 billion rupees to about 10 billion rupees, almost one-third of the total budget.

The Indian reactionary government uses the pretext of "defending against threats from China and Pakistan" to cover up the fact that its military expansion is serving the interests of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian bureaucratic comprador capitalists. This deception has long been exposed. The Indian people are rising up to fight, determined to smash the reactionary rule established by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists through their lackeys in India.

    美苏指使印度反动政府疯狂扩军
    据新华社十一日讯 新德里消息：在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团的指使和帮助下，印度反动政府正在不顾国内严重的经济困难，继续疯狂地增加军费，扩充军备，更加残酷地压榨生活已经十分困苦的印度人民。
    印度反动政府最近得到了它的主子美帝国主义的同意，从英国买到了一批霍克猎人式战斗轰炸机。去年十二月初，印度国防部长透露，苏修帮助印度反动政府修建的米格式喷气战斗机工厂已开工生产。据悉，其中一座工厂设在奥里萨邦，生产机身；一座设在马哈拉施特拉邦，生产发动机；另一座设在安得拉邦，生产米格式战斗机所用的导弹。这些工厂都是在一九六二年印度反动派向中国发动大规模进攻以后修建的。
    据印度报业托辣斯透露，印度政府在一九六七年内竭力以四十五个中队为目标扩充它的空军。同时，印度政府修建了更多的空军基地。过去，美帝国主义同印度反动政府曾经达成过协议，一旦美帝国主义认为对它发动侵略战争有必要时，将把它的空军开到印度，使用印度反动政府为它准备好的空军基地。
    印度报刊还透露，美印两国政府正在商谈在中印边境完成一个“雷达系统”的工程的问题。这项工程是一九六二年印度反动派向中国发动大规模进攻后，美帝帮助印度反动政府修建的。这显然是为美帝和印度空军的侵略行动提供方便的军事工程。
    去年十一月，印度国防部长曾经大肆叫嚷印度为了“加强国防”而需要潜水艇。就在这个时候，印度报刊透露，苏修供给印度反动政府的四艘潜水艇即将加入印度的舰队。
    美帝和苏修指使印度反动派扩充军备的目的，一方面是使印度反动政府进一步去反对中国和镇压亚非人民的解放斗争；另一方面通过印度反动政府增加军费来剥削印度人民。从印度反动政府向中国和巴基斯坦发动武装进攻以来，印度政府每年军费开支已经从过去每年的三十亿卢比以下猛增为每年约一百亿卢比，差不多占总预算支出的三分之一。
    印度反动政府以所谓“对付中国和巴基斯坦的威胁”为借口，掩盖它扩充军备是为美帝、苏修、印度官僚买办资本的利益效劳的实质。它的这种欺骗早已不灵了。印度人民正在奋起斗争，决心把美帝、苏修通过它们的走狗在印度建立的反动统治彻底砸烂。
