Japanese revolutionary people have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in their struggles, pushing the revolutionary movement forward.

According to a report from our correspondent in Tokyo: Since last year, Japanese revolutionary people have deeply felt, through their active study and application of Chairman Mao's brilliant works, that Mao Zedong Thought is like sunshine and rain, nurturing the Japanese revolutionary people. They have also deeply realized that making the revolution must rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Studying the "Three Articles" to Become Vanguard Fighters of the Proletariat

1967 was a year when Japanese revolutionary people universally and deeply studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant works. Revolutionary leftists in various places regarded Mao Zedong's works, especially the "Three Articles," as the sharpest ideological weapons to oppose the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists, and the Rengo revisionist clique. They emphasized that in the process of studying the "Three Articles," they should strive to reform their worldview, establish a mindset dedicated to the revolution, and forge themselves into vanguard fighters of the proletariat who are forever loyal to the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Aichi Prefectural Committee decided last year to launch a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles." The leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party in Kyoto particularly pointed out that the "Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for defeating imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and for carrying out revolutionary struggles.

To meet the urgent demand of revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's works, the Dongfang Bookstore and the revolutionary leftists in Osaka, Yamaguchi, and Kyoto successively published the Japanese versions of the "Three Articles" and "Selected Works of Chairman Mao."

Various publications issued by revolutionary leftists and progressive organizations in different parts of Japan, such as "Revolutionary Fighter," "Long Weekly News," "Youth Fighter," "Studies on Mao Zedong Thought," "Japan and China," and other newspapers and periodicals, all vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought, effectively promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works by revolutionary masses in various places.

Revolutionary study groups for the "Three Articles" have been organized in various parts of Japan. Revolutionary masses in these study groups eagerly study the "Three Articles." Revolutionary youth in Yamaguchi Prefecture, while studying the "Three Articles," examined their actions in light of the spirit of the "Three Articles" and set their own tasks.

Learning in Struggle, Applying in Struggle

Learning in struggle, applying in struggle, studying for revolutionary struggle, and combining study with application have become a distinctive feature of Japanese revolutionary people's study of Chairman Mao's works last year.

In their struggles against U.S. military bases last year, in their struggles against the Sato government's tyranny, and in their struggles against the Rengo revisionist clique, Japanese revolutionary people actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, pushing the Japanese revolutionary movement forward like an irresistible tide.

In October last year, thousands of farmers near the Iwakuni U.S. military base, inspired by Chairman Mao's teaching to dare to struggle against all reactionaries, gathered in front of the U.S. military base and held a grand demonstration. In the face of a large number of armed Japanese police, they collectively recited Chairman Mao's quotations loudly, fearlessly, and bravely fought against the enemy.

When opposing Sato's "visit" to Taiwan, South Vietnam, and Washington, as well as opposing the visit of Chiang Kai-shek's henchman Chiang Ching-kuo to Japan, Japanese revolutionary people, with the revolutionary spirit of "firmly resolving to fight and not fearing sacrifice," broke through the heavy blockade of Japanese police and engaged in fierce struggles with the reactionaries.

The brilliant thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao have exerted tremendous power among Japanese revolutionary people. An article recently published in "Studies on Mao Zedong Thought" pointed out: "In 1967, Mao Zedong Thought forged many revolutionary fighters in Japan who struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Rengo revisionist clique, renewing the face of the Japanese revolutionary movement and strengthening the ranks of the revolutionary leftists day by day." In the new year, Mao Zedong Thought will be more widely spread among the broad masses of the Japanese people, and more Japanese revolutionary people will master this powerful ideological weapon. The Japanese revolutionary people, united and fighting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly achieve greater victories in their future struggles.

    干革命靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    日本革命人民在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，使革命运动滚滚向前
    据新华社东京电　本社记者报道：去年以来，日本革命人民在活学活用毛主席的光辉著作中，深切地体会到毛泽东思想象阳光、雨露一样，滋润着日本革命人民，他们也深深地认识到干革命必须依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    学习“老三篇”　做无产阶级先锋战士
    一九六七年是日本革命人民普遍深入活学活用毛主席光辉著作的一年。各地革命左派把毛主席著作，特别是“老三篇”当做反对美日反动派、苏修和宫本修正主义集团的最锐利的思想武器。他们强调在学习“老三篇”的过程中，努力改造自己的世界观，树立起一心为革命的思想，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的无产阶级先锋战士。日共爱知县委员会（左派）去年作出决定，号召掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，特别是活学活用“老三篇”。日共京都革命左派特别指出，“老三篇”是战胜帝修反、开展革命斗争的强大的思想武器。
    为了满足革命群众学习毛主席著作的迫切要求，东方书店和大阪、山口、京都的革命左派先后出版了日文版“老三篇”和《毛主席论文选》。
    日本各地革命左派和进步团体出版的一些刊物，如《革命战士》、《长周新闻》、《青年战士》、《毛泽东思想研究》、《日本与中国》以及其他一些报刊，都大力传播毛泽东思想，有力地推动了各地革命群众活学活用毛主席著作。
    日本各地组织了许多学习“老三篇”的学习小组，革命群众在这些学习小组里，如饥似渴地学习“老三篇”。山口县革命青年在学习“老三篇”时，对照“老三篇”的精神来检查自己的行动，订出自己的任务。
    在斗争中学　在斗争中用
    在斗争中学，在斗争中用，为革命斗争而学，学用结合，已经成为日本革命人民去年学习毛主席著作的一个鲜明的特点。
    日本革命人民在去年反对美军基地的斗争中，在反对佐藤政府的暴政中，在反对宫本修正主义集团的斗争中，活学活用毛主席的光辉思想，使日本革命运动滚滚向前，形成一股不可抗拒的洪流。
    去年十月间，岩国美军基地附近的几千农民在毛主席的要敢于同一切反动派作斗争的教导的鼓舞下，聚集在美军基地门前，举行了声势浩大的示威。在大批日本武装警察面前，他们集体高声朗读毛主席语录，毫无惧色，英勇地同敌人进行斗争。
    在反对佐藤“访问”台湾、南越和华盛顿以及反对蒋匪帮头目蒋经国“访日”的时候，日本革命人民都以“下定决心，不怕牺牲”的革命精神，冲破日本警察的重重封锁，同反动派展开了英勇的搏斗。
    伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想在日本革命人民中间发挥了巨大的威力。《毛泽东思想研究》不久前发表的文章指出：“在一九六七年，毛泽东思想在日本人民中间锻炼了许多同美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团进行斗争的革命战士，使日本革命运动的面目为之一新，正在一天比一天加强着革命左派的队伍。”在新的一年里，毛泽东思想将在日本广大人民中间更加广泛地传播，将会有更多的日本革命人民掌握这一强大的思想武器。团结和战斗在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下的日本革命人民，在今后的斗争中，必将取得更大的胜利。
