The Great Popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, Deepening of Revolutionary Criticism, and Strengthening of Revolutionary Unity and Three-in-One Combination in Gansu

Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the situation in Gansu Province has become exceptionally good and continues to improve. Millions of people have been fully mobilized. Mao Zedong Thought is widely popularized, and Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line has penetrated the hearts of the people. The revolutionary criticism is deepening, and the revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are reaching a climax. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. The broad revolutionary masses are full of spirit and high morale, determined to follow the brilliant strategic deployment of Chairman Mao in the radiant year of 1968, to implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Gansu Province was an important stronghold where Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and carried out capitalist restoration activities. For many years, they gathered all reactionary forces in society, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian dictatorship, and sabotaging the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, two-line struggle in Gansu. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses formed a vast army of cultural revolutionaries and engaged in a thrilling struggle with Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu, exposing them, overthrowing them, and seizing back the power over party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped. To thoroughly criticize and expose Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to eliminate all the revisionist poison they spread, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres repeatedly launched waves of revolutionary criticism. In this struggle, the broad revolutionary masses stood at the forefront, and many deceived masses and erring cadres also returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, participating in the revolutionary criticism and exposing and criticizing Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu without mercy. White-haired elders, children, and housewives all actively participated in the criticism. In Lanzhou City alone, since August 5 last year, more than 2 million people have participated in large and small struggle meetings against Khrushchev's agents in Gansu. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses have further recognized the counter-revolutionary faces of Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has penetrated deeper into the hearts of the people. At the same time, through revolutionary criticism, class lines have been drawn, the broad masses have been united, a large number of reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution have been cultivated, and a large number of good cadres who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been discovered.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread and popularized in Gansu Province, opening a new era for the working people to directly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Now, studying, propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought have become the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses; reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become good soldiers of Chairman Mao have become the common vow of the broad revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses consciously put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, and firmly implement Chairman Mao's instructions. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to criticize and repudiate revisionism, Gansu immediately established many Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, Lanzhou alone has established more than 3,000 such classes with over 130,000 participants. Through the criticism and repudiation of revisionism, the broad revolutionary masses have risen up to eliminate factionalism, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity. Now, most grassroots units in Lanzhou City have achieved revolutionary unity. Since September last year, the Lanzhou Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress, Revolutionary Peasants' Congress, and Red Guards' Congresses of colleges and secondary schools have been established one after another, and revolutionary unity has reached a climax.

Now, revolutionary committees are being established from the bottom up in various places in Gansu. More than 550 grassroots revolutionary committees have been established throughout the province. A large number of grassroots units have established temporary power organs with the three-in-one combination, announcing the complete failure of Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu's dream of restoring capitalism in Gansu, and laying a solid foundation for the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, a temporary power organ with the three-in-one combination, representativeness, and proletarian authority.

Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated the hearts of the people, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has penetrated the hearts of the people. The spiritual transformation into material has promoted the industrial and agricultural production in the whole province to present a very good situation. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have responded positively to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," striving to become revolutionary pioneers and production models. Therefore, the summer and autumn grains in the whole province last year all achieved bumper harvests. Cotton production also increased significantly compared to the previous year. Industrial production has been increasing month by month in recent months. Since October last year, the average daily coal production in the whole province has been increasing month by month. The railway transportation situation has also improved significantly.

The great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province is inseparable from the strong support of the Lanzhou units of the People's Liberation Army. The broad officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou units executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks have a firm stand, clear banners, and steadfastly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are closely connected with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, sharing weal and woe, and life and death. They actively support the broad leftist masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helping the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making the revolutionary masses of the proletariat continuously develop and grow stronger. In the past year, the broad officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou units have made great contributions to the cultural revolution in Gansu Province and have been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. A new situation of the army loving the people, the people supporting the army, and the army and people uniting as one has been formed. (Accompanying picture)

Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread and popularized in Gansu Province.

    毛泽东思想大普及，革命大批判日益深入
    革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展
    甘肃为成立省革命委员会打下坚实基础
    据新华社兰州二十二日电　经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，甘肃省的各方面形势空前大好，越来越好。千百万群众已经充分发动起来，毛泽东思想大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心，革命的大批判正在深入开展，革命的大联合和革命的三结合出现了高潮，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。广大革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心在光辉灿烂的一九六八年紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    甘肃省是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，进行资本主义复辟活动的重要据点之一。多年来，他们在这里纠集社会上的一切反动势力，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对和破坏无产阶级专政，反对和破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底揭开了甘肃地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，广大革命群众在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，组成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人展开了一场惊心动魄的大搏斗，把他们揪出来，打翻在地，夺回被他们篡夺了的党、政、财、文大权。为了从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人彻底批倒批臭，肃清他们散布的一切修正主义流毒，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众一次又一次地掀起了革命大批判的高潮。在这场斗争中，广大无产阶级革命派站在最前列，一些受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部也纷纷回到毛主席的革命路线一边来，参加革命大批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人进行无情的揭发和批判。白发老人、三尺儿童、家庭妇女，也都积极参加批判。仅兰州市不完全统计，自去年八月五日到现在，参加对中国赫鲁晓夫在甘肃的代理人进行的大小斗争会的群众达二百多万人（次）。通过革命的大批判，使广大群众更加认清了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人的反革命嘴脸，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。同时，通过革命的大批判，划清了阶级阵线，团结了广大群众，培养了大批无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，发现了一大批无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的好干部。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想在甘肃省大传播，大普及，开创了劳动人民直接掌握和运用毛泽东思想的新纪元。现在，学习、宣传、执行和捍卫毛泽东思想，已成为广大革命群众的自觉行动；读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，已成为广大革命群众的共同誓言。广大革命群众自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置，对待毛主席的指示，坚决照办。在毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召以后，甘肃各地立即大办毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，仅兰州一地就办了三千多个，参加学习的有十三万多人。通过斗私批修，广大革命群众纷纷起来铲除山头，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进一步发展和巩固了革命的大联合。现在，兰州市的基层单位绝大多数已实现了革命的大联合。去年九月份以来，又陆续成立了兰州地区革命工人代表大会、革命农民代表大会、大专院校红卫兵和中等学校红卫兵代表大会等组织，革命大联合出现了高潮。
    现在，甘肃各地正在自下而上地成立革命委员会。全省基层革命委员会已成立五百五十多个。大批基层单位成立三结合的临时权力机构，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人企图在甘肃复辟资本主义的美梦的彻底破产，为成立全省三结合的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——甘肃省革命委员会打下了坚实的基础。
    毛泽东思想深入人心，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心，精神变物质，促使全省的工农业生产出现一派大好形势。广大贫下中农坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，人人争做革命闯将和生产模范。因此去年全省夏粮和秋粮都获得了大丰收。棉花也比前年有大幅度的增长。工业生产近几个月来产量也是逐月上升。去年十月份以来，全省煤炭平均日产量月月增加。铁路运输情况也大为好转。
    甘肃省无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的出现，是同人民解放军兰州部队的大力支援分不开的。执行“三支”“两军”任务的兰州部队广大指战员立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚定不移地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们同广大无产阶级革命派血肉相连，风雨同舟，生死与共。他们用毛泽东思想积极支持广大左派群众，帮助广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，使无产阶级革命派不断得到发展壮大。一年来，兰州部队广大指战员为甘肃省的文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献，受到了广大革命群众热烈拥护。一个军爱民、民拥军，军民团结如一人的崭新局面已经形成。（附图片）
