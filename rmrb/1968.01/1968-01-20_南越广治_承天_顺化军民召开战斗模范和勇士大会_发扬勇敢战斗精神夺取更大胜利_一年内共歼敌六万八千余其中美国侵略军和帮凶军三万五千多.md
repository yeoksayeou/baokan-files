Military and civilians in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region of South Vietnam recently held a conference of combat heroes and warriors. The conference summarized and commended the glorious achievements of the past year and resolved to press forward to achieve even greater victories in the winter-spring campaign.

In the period from November 1966 to November 1967, the military and civilians of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region bravely fought the enemy, killing and wounding 68,700 enemy personnel, including 35,300 American troops and puppet soldiers; shooting down and destroying more than 600 enemy aircraft; and destroying or damaging nearly 1,900 enemy vehicles of various types.

Several hundred representatives, including combat heroes, warriors, and representatives of units that have distinguished themselves in fighting Americans, attended the conference.

A representative of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region delivered a report at the conference, summarizing the glorious victories achieved by the military and civilians of the region in annihilating a large number of enemy forces over the past year. The report stated that the military and civilians of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region, in the past year, displayed a spirit of brave combat, striking the enemy fiercely in the mountains, plains, transportation lines, cities, and various important enemy bases, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, and at the same time, smashing the enemy's "pacification" plans for the countryside.

The report pointed out that in the past year, in the movement to compete in killing the enemy and achieving merit, more than 10,000 warriors emerged in this region. In the first ten months of 1967, nearly 3,000 units and individuals on the battlefield of Route 9 alone were awarded military and liberation medals of various levels.

The report praised the revolutionary heroism of the military and civilians of the region. They have an unparalleled love for the people and comrades, and a deep hatred for the enemy; they are full of firm confidence in the victory and future of the revolution, and in battle, they strive to be the best, advancing bravely with the momentum to overwhelm the enemy.

Representatives of combat heroes, warriors, and advanced collectives of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region also made typical speeches at the conference. The conference awarded the banner of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, "For the cause of liberating the South, fighting bravely and achieving merit," to the military and civilians of Hue City; and the banner of the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, "For the cause of liberating the South, fighting to the end and achieving final victory," to a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province.

The conference also awarded competition banners, medals, and certificates to units and individuals who had achieved outstanding results in brave combat and service to the combat in the past year.

The conference sent separate telegrams to Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressing their determination to fulfill the sacred task of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. No matter how many troops and war tools the U.S. imperialists increase on the battlefield of Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue, they will be thoroughly defeated.
