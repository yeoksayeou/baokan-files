A mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is vigorously unfolding in Shanghai. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary people, and the vast number of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai are determined to raise high the brilliant red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the radiant year of 1968, to redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the ideological, political, economic, and organizational fronts.

Since the beginning of the new year, Shanghai's various fronts have presented a scene of revolutionary fervor. On January 11, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting, calling on the revolutionary cadres and people of the entire city to carry forward the spirit of the January Revolution, to raise high the brilliant red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to strive and struggle for the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Factories, schools, military units, government agencies, and neighborhoods have recently held study sessions, discussions, reporting meetings, and rally meetings to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary committees of Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7, and Aimin Candy Factory have formulated this year's battle plans based on summing up the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1967. The revolutionary committee of Shanghai Port Area No. 3 has formulated five measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In recent periods, the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, with learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the primary content, has reached a new high in various departments and units in Shanghai. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more numerous, better, and more experienced. Various units and departments, based on the actual situation of their movements, are studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item. Some units and departments that have not yet achieved revolutionary unity have recently seriously and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "All factories, schools, departments, and enterprises must, under the principle of revolution, according to their systems, according to their industries, and according to their classes, achieve revolutionary great unity, in order to promote the establishment of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, in order to facilitate the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of various units, in order to grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war." "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in these units and departments, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, have done more self-criticism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and are determined to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and achieve revolutionary great unity. Units and departments that have already achieved revolutionary great unity are actively working to establish revolutionary committees to continue to push the revolution forward. They are seriously and repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit. We must solve this problem. Our party, through the Yan'an Rectification Movement, educated a large number of cadres, united the entire party, and ensured the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. This tradition, we must carry it forward." The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in these units and departments, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, actively and enthusiastically help revolutionary cadres to correctly handle the masses and correctly handle themselves, bravely come out to revolution, and promote the rapid establishment of the temporary power organ of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Practice in struggle has proven that the bourgeois "self" is a stumbling block to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Whoever has "self" dominating their mind cannot respond swiftly and decisively to Chairman Mao's latest instructions; cannot achieve learning and application combined, with immediate results. In the new year, the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the entire city are determined to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forget class struggle" and "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," to always be vigilant against class enemies, to strive to change their worldview, and to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the struggle against the enemy and in the struggle to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit.

With the implementation of the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on various fronts in Shanghai is vigorously advancing, and inspiring news is continuously coming in. On January 9, the revolutionary mass organizations of the two factions in Songjiang achieved revolutionary great unity on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, which greatly encouraged the revolutionary cadres of Shanghai's suburbs. Under the influence of Songjiang County, many revolutionary mass organizations in Qingpu, Fengxian, and other counties have also begun to sit together, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do self-criticism, resolve contradictions, and promote unity. These situations indicate that the high tide of revolutionary great unity in Shanghai's suburbs has arrived. The revolutionary mass organizations of the two factions in Shanghai's paper industry have also, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," reached an agreement on great unity and achieved revolutionary great unity. In many large and medium-sized schools, the broad revolutionary teachers and students are further implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "resuming classes and making revolution," striving to remove various interferences, and doing a good job in resuming classes and making revolution. At the same time, they are launching a movement to thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution, pushing the educational revolution forward.

The soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, who have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, have, from the first day of the fighting year of 1968, launched a wave of learning, propagating, implementing, and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the greatest political enthusiasm and the strongest sense of revolutionary responsibility. The left-supporting units, from the leadership organs to every soldier, have taken Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon, have taken the "left-supporting and loving-the-people model platoon," the "left-supporting and loving-the-people model" comrade Li Wenzhong, and the 8341st Unit as examples, seriously reviewed and summed up the experience and lessons of their left-supporting work in the past year, found the gaps, formulated measures, and are determined to redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and continue to make new achievements in the new year to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Shanghai Military District Party Committee and the left-supporting units, in accordance with the new situation and new requirements, have adjusted and strengthened the left-supporting forces; many units have held rally meetings to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; many soldiers and officers have also organized propaganda teams to go to factories, rural areas, neighborhoods, and schools, using various forms of propaganda to widely carry out propaganda, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts, vowing to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛泽东思想学习班越办越多越办越好
    上海掀起全面落实最新指示群众运动
    各条战线一派热气腾腾的革命景象，革命大联合喜讯不断传来。驻沪三军党委和各支左部队调整和加强支左力量，组织宣传队深入基层，广泛宣传贯彻毛主席最新指示
    据新华社上海十六日电　一个活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，在上海蓬勃展开。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和解放军驻沪陆海空三军广大指战员，决心在光辉灿烂的一九六八年，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，鼓足干劲，力争上游，以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为纲，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    新年以来，上海各条战线上，到处呈现一派热气腾腾的革命景象。上海市革命委员会在一月十一日举行了扩大会议，号召全市无产阶级革命派和革命人民，继续发扬“一月革命”精神，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。工厂、学校、部队、机关、街道，最近纷纷举行学习会、座谈会、讲用会和誓师大会，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。上海杨树浦发电厂、上海无线电七厂、爱民糖果厂等工厂的革命委员会在总结一九六七年无产阶级文化大革命经验的基础上，制定了今年的战斗规划。上海港三区革命委员会制定了落实毛主席最新指示的五项措施。
    最近一个时期以来，上海市各部门、各单位以学习毛主席最新指示为首要内容的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，出现了新的高潮。毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，越办经验越丰富。各单位、各部门根据本单位、本部门运动发展的实际情况，逐条学习、逐条落实毛主席的最新指示。一些还没有实现革命大联合的单位、部门，最近都认真地反复学习毛主席的教导：“各工厂、各学校、各部门、各企业单位，都必须在革命的原则下，按照系统，按照行业，按照班级，实现革命的大联合，以利于促进革命三结合的建立，以利大批判和各单位斗批改的进行，以利于抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备。”“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这些单位、部门的革命群众组织负责人，遵照毛主席的指示，各自多做自我批评，加强无产阶级党性，决心打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，实现革命大联合。已经实现革命大联合的单位、部门，为了把革命继续推向前进，正在积极着手建立革命委员会。他们认真地反复学习毛主席的教导：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。我们党，经过延安整风，教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。这个传统，我们一定要发扬。”这些单位、部门的无产阶级革命派和革命群众按照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，积极、热情地帮助革命干部用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命，促进革命三结合的临时权力机构迅速建立。
    斗争实践证明，资产阶级的“私”字，是落实毛主席最新指示的绊脚石。谁头脑里“私”字占了上风，对毛主席最新指示就不可能做到闻风而动，雷厉风行；就不可能做到学用结合，立竿见影。在新的一年中，全市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，决心牢牢记住毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“要斗私，批修”的教导，时刻保持对阶级敌人的警惕，努力改造世界观，在对敌斗争中，在破私立公斗争中，把毛主席的最新指示落实、落实、再落实。
    随着伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的落实，上海各条战线的无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃向前发展，令人振奋的喜讯不断传来。松江两派革命群众组织一月九日在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命大联合，这一喜讯极大地鼓舞了上海郊区的无产阶级革命派。在松江县的影响下，青浦、奉贤等县许多革命群众组织的负责人也开始坐到一起，学习毛主席最新指示，各自做自我批评，解决矛盾，促进联合。这些情况表明：上海郊区革命大联合的高潮已经到来。上海造纸工业两派革命群众组织，也以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，达成了大联合的协议，实现了革命大联合。在许多大、中学校里，广大革命师生正在进一步贯彻毛主席“要复课闹革命”的指示，努力排除各种干扰，搞好复课闹革命，同时，掀起大学大用毛主席关于教育革命的指示，把教育革命推向前进。
    为上海市的无产阶级文化大革命建立了丰功伟绩的驻沪陆海空三军指战员，从战斗的一九六八年第一天起，就以最大的政治热情，最强的革命责任感，掀起了学习、宣传、贯彻、落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。各支左部队从领导机关到每一个战士，都以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为强大的思想武器，以“支左爱民模范排”、“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志和八三四一部队为榜样，认真检查总结了过去一年支左工作的经验教训，找出了差距，制订了措施，决心鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，为在新的一年夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利建立新功。驻沪三军党委和各支左部队根据新形势、新要求，调整和加强了支左力量；许多部队召开了全面落实毛主席最新指示的誓师大会；许多部队指战员还组织了宣传队，到工厂、农村、街道、学校，运用各种宣传形式，广泛展开宣传，让毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论家喻户晓，深入人心，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
