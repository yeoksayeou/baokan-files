    People's Supervisory Committee Strictly Enforces Laws and Discipline
    Personnel Who Use Their Positions for Personal Gain are Punished
    Lin Jie, Former Manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, and Others Receive Two Major Demerits
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the notification from the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government regarding the handling of the case involving Lin Jie, the former manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, and others violating policies and seeking personal gain: In August 1949, Lin Jie, manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, used 250,000 yuan, Deputy Manager Du Zengfu 80,000 yuan, Business Section Chief Zheng Daqi 150,000 yuan, Deputy Section Chief Ke Yi 30,000 yuan, and Accounting Section Chief Song Wenhua 50,000 yuan, totaling 560,000 yuan, to jointly purchase and hoard one barrel of pigment. On November 28th, they sold the pigment to the Xinzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, receiving 2,250,000 yuan, with a net profit of 1,690,000 yuan. In addition, Zheng Daqi partnered with private businessman Jia Ying to invest in and operate the Delong Cloth Shop in Wuji County, engaging in private cloth business (Zheng and Jia are both from Niuzhuang Village, Wuji County). He also colluded with Lin Jie, intending to use the proceeds from the pigment sale to buy cloth through Jia Ying for profit, but this was unsuccessful due to Du Zengfu's disapproval.
    At that time, Liu Yizhi, a staff member of the Ding County Military Sub-district Supply Cooperative, exchanged 4,885 catties of wheat coupons brought from Ding County for 84 bags of Wanshoushan flour (totaling over 3,662 catties) from the Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. Lin Jie, based on his past relationship as Liu Yizhi's former superior, sold the flour to the company's employee cooperative at a low price of 34,000 yuan per bag (the price on that day's People's Daily was 40,000 yuan per bag). Furthermore, he used 40 tons of the company's special raw coal and exploited his authority by backdating the transaction and lowering the listed price, using the price of 87,500 yuan per ton from the 25th as an exchange condition (the listed price that day was 100,000 yuan per ton). Lin Jie violated the government's explicit ban on transporting coal south, causing a loss of 500,000 yuan to the public.
    Zheng Daqi further exploited his authority by using 3,850,000 yuan, the proceeds from selling 180 bolts of local cloth transported from Wuji County, which he jointly operated with private businessman Jia Ying, to purchase 40 tons of special raw coal on the 29th, falsely in Lin Jie's name, and designated Liu Yizhi to act on behalf of the Ding County Military Sub-district. He used the price of the 25th, causing the company another loss of 500,000 yuan. Seeing the potential profit in transporting coal south, Lin Jie and Zheng Daqi, on the 30th, once again designated Liu Yizhi to falsely use the name of the military sub-district, and used the funds from the aforementioned pigment sale, plus some additional funds, to purchase 40 tons of special raw coal at the price of 87,500 yuan per ton from the 25th (the actual price of special raw coal on the 30th was 100,000 yuan per ton). They planned to transport these two batches of coal privately to Ding County for sale. Unexpectedly, while the coal payment was being counted at the Renfa Gong Bank, Song Wenhua reported that someone was using their position to purchase coal for profit. Knowing that the matter was exposed, Lin Jie ordered Zheng Daqi to send Ke Yi to the Renfa Gong Bank to retrieve the coal payment that was being counted, halting the further plan to purchase and transport coal south for profit, and dividing the recovered proceeds from the pigment sale equally among the shareholders. Only the 40 tons of raw coal purchased on the 29th were transported to Ding County, where Liu Yizhi sold it for 170,000 yuan per ton. After deducting the original cost and transportation expenses, a net profit of 2,940,000 yuan was obtained, of which Zheng Daqi received 745,000 yuan. Although Lin Jie had no capital involvement in this matter, as the manager, he bore the responsibility and, knowing that Zheng Daqi was colluding with private businessman Jia Ying, engaging in private gain at public expense, he failed to stop it.
    Based on the above facts, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government made the following analysis and disposition:
    (1) Lin Jie, as the manager, failed to uphold his duties and colluded with Du Zengfu, Zheng Daqi, Ke Yi, Song Wenhua, and others to pool funds to hoard pigment for profit. Knowing that Zheng Daqi was partnering with private businessman Jia Ying to operate a cloth business, he not only failed to correct it but also intended to use the proceeds from the pigment sale to buy cloth for profit. After this failed, he attempted to exploit his authority to traffic coal, using 40 tons of special raw coal and lowering the listed price as an exchange condition to cheaply purchase 84 bags of Liu Yizhi's flour for the employee cooperative. This not only violated the government's ban on transporting Beijing coal south and the prohibition of government personnel from engaging in private business using their authority, but also caused the company a loss of 1,000,000 yuan. Afterwards, during multiple investigations, he still did not frankly reveal the truth. Only after Liu Yizhi and Jia Ying provided proof was he forced to admit the facts and failed to sincerely reflect and learn from his mistakes. He should be given two major demerits.
    (2) Zheng Daqi, as the Business Section Chief, not only participated in pooling funds to hoard pigment but also colluded with private businessman Jia Ying to operate a cloth business. He exploited his authority to traffic coal, profiting 745,000 yuan, amounting to embezzlement. Afterwards, he did not frankly reveal the truth and shielded Lin Jie, violating the law and neglecting his duties, showing no remorse. He should be given two major demerits, and the profits obtained should be recovered.
    (3) Ke Yi, Deputy Chief of the Business Section, participated in pooling funds to hoard pigment, seeking personal gain, and followed Zheng Daqi's instructions to retrieve the payments that were being counted for the privately purchased and transported coal. During the investigation of the incident, he also attempted to shield Lin Jie, failing to honestly reflect the true situation. However, considering that he was driven by Zheng Daqi, he will be given a minor demerit.
    (4) Du Zengfu, the Deputy Manager, participated in pooling funds to hoard pigment, seeking personal gain, which was not without violation of the law. However, he did not agree with Lin Jie's continued plan to buy cloth for profit and has shown awareness. He will be given a warning.
    (5) Song Wenhua, the Chief of the Accounting Section, although he participated in pooling funds to hoard pigment for personal gain, he discovered and reported Lin Jie and others' trafficking of coal for profit, which stopped the incident and reduced losses for the company. He will be exempted from punishment.
    (6) Hu Yi, of the Political Department of the Ding County Military Sub-district, reported to this committee the situation of Lin Jie, the manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, and others violating policies and seeking personal gain. After investigation, these were all confirmed to be facts and should be commended.

    人民监察委员会严明法纪
    处分利用职权营私图利人员
    原北京煤铁分公司经理林洁等记大过二次
    【本报讯】据中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会通报处理原北京煤铁分公司经理林洁等违反政策，营私图利事件案称：一九四九年八月，北京煤铁分公司经理林洁曾以二十五万元，副经理杜增福八万元，业务科长郑大器十五万元，副科长克毅三万元，会计股长宋文华五万元，共计五十六万元，合伙购囤颜料一桶。于十一月二十八日将颜料出售给新中染织厂，得价款二百二十五万元，获纯利一百六十九万元。另郑大器与私商贾英，合伙投资经营无极县德隆布店，私营布业（郑、贾均系无极县牛庄人），并与林洁互相勾结，意图利用售出颜料之价款再托贾英买布营利，因杜增福不同意未果。
    是时定县军分区供应社职员刘一志将由定县带来之麦票四、八八五斤，向财政部供应局换成万寿山面粉八十四袋（合三、六六二斤多）。林洁以过去是刘一志老上级的关系，将面粉每袋以三万四千元之廉价（是日人民日报上每袋四万元）代该公司职工合作社购下，另以公司特原煤四十吨，利用职权，倒填日期，降低牌价，按二十五日牌价每吨八七、五○○元作为交换条件（是日牌价每吨十万元）。林洁竟于政府明令煤炭不准南运期间，违反规定，使公家损失五十万元。
    郑大器复利用职权，把自己与私商贾英合伙经营由无极运京土布一百八十匹出售之价款三百八十五万元，于同月二十九日假林洁名义，指定刘一志出面，以定县军分区名义，仍以二十五日牌价购特原煤四十吨，使公司又受损失五十万元。林洁与郑大器以煤炭南运有利可图，于同月三十日又指定刘一志，复假用军分区名义将前述合伙售出颜料及另加筹一部分之款，按二十五日特原煤牌价每吨八七、五○○元（实际三十日特原煤牌价每吨十万元），购特原煤四十吨，拟随同以上两批煤炭私自南运定县出售，不料正在向仁发公银号点交煤款，被宋文华反映有人利用职权购煤营利情事，林洁知道事情败露，遂叫郑大器派克毅追至仁发公银号，把正在点交的煤款收回，中止了再购煤南运的营利计划，并将收回的售颜料所得之款按股均分。只将二十九日所购原煤四十吨同车运到定县，由刘一志以每吨十七万元代为售出，除原本及运费外，获纯利二百九十四万元，郑大器分得七十四万五千元，林洁与此事虽无本款关系。而身负经理责任，明知郑大器与私商贾英勾结，假公济私，亦竟未加禁止。
    中央人民政府人民监察委员会根据以上事实，作了如下的分析和处理：
    （一）林洁身为经理，不能恪守职责，竟勾结杜增福、郑大器、克毅、宋文华等，集款购囤颜料图利，明知郑大器与私商贾英合伙经营布业，不但未加纠正，反而意图利用所售颜料款买布图利，未遂后，复图利用职权，贩运煤炭，并以特原煤四十吨，减低牌价作为交换条件，廉价为职工合作社购买刘一志面粉八十四袋。不仅违反政府禁止京煤南运及机关人员不准利用职权私人经营生意的规定，且使公司损失一百万元。事后在多次调查中，仍不坦白真相，经刘一志、贾英证明，始被迫承认事实，未能忠实检讨，接受教训，应予记大过二次处分。
    （二）业务科长郑大器既参加集款购囤颜料，复勾结私商贾英经营布业，利用职权，贩运煤斤，获利七十四万五千元，形同贪污，事后不坦白真相，并包庇林洁，违法失职，不知悔改，应予记大过二次处分。并追回营利所得之款。
    （三）业务科副科长克毅，参加集款购囤颜料，图谋私利，并听从郑大器指示，追回点交的私自购运煤斤款项，于事件调查中，尚图包庇林洁，不坦白反映真实情况，惟念其是受郑大器之驱使，从轻记过一次。
    （四）副经理杜增福，参加集款购囤颜料，图谋私利，不无违法，惟未同意林洁继续买布营利，已有觉悟，从轻予以劝告。
    （五）会计股长宋文华，虽参加集款购囤颜料，图谋私利，而林洁等贩运煤斤图利情事，被其发觉反映而中止，使公司少受损失，免予处分。
    （六）定县军分区政治部胡毅，向本委反映了北京煤铁分公司经理林洁等违反政策营私图利情形，经检查后均系事实，应予表扬。
