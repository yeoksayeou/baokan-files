Introducing the Shandong Xuzhou Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station

(I) Establishment Process:

The Shandong Xuzhou Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station was formally established in late April of this year. According to the central government's instructions, its primary task was to assist local governments in preventing and controlling locusts and other major plant diseases and insect pests. The working area includes central and southern Shandong, as well as northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui. The station is located within the Xuzhou Agricultural Experiment Station. In terms of staff allocation, in addition to five people dispatched by the Provincial Department of Industry and three extension workers transferred from the Xuzhou Farm to work at the station, the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry also sent technical cadres to assist in the work. The director and deputy director of the station are concurrently held by the director and deputy director of the farm.

Because the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station was newly established and had no foundation, all work is temporarily combined with the farm. The work also emphasizes learning from the masses' experience in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and strengthening scientific and technical guidance to carry out a mass movement for disease prevention and pest control.

(II) Several Major Tasks:

1. Establishing an Information Network: Because the distribution of locusts is widespread in the vicinity of Xuzhou, covering the three administrative regions of central and southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, pest control work is relatively complex, the working area is vast, and there are many types of plant diseases and insect pests. Therefore, the Xuzhou Station paid special attention to the issue of information liaison, making the establishment of an information network and timely grasp of plant disease and insect pest conditions in various places one of the main tasks of the year. After the station's work was in order, it immediately seized the time to go to various locust areas for inspection, established contact with local governments, and established a reporting system centered on the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station.

The information network takes the county as the main unit, relying on agricultural farms or governments at all levels. A special information station is set up in each county, an information officer is set up in each district, and the village relies on the insect catching committee, etc., all with dedicated personnel responsible. Under the active promotion of the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, a total of thirty-four special county information stations were established in two months (nineteen in Shandong, eight in northern Jiangsu, and seven in northern Anhui). In addition, it maintains regular contact with the Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Administrative Offices. It has played a certain role in grasping the plant disease and insect pest situation. After the establishment of the Huashan County Information Station in Shandong, in addition to being responsible for reporting, it also directly led the masses in catching and killing insect pests. Sihong County in northern Anhui also has a very strict information organization. The county information station has an information brigade in each district, and the village has two information groups, responsible for inspection and reporting by district. Therefore, the county and the station can report immediately when insect plagues occur. After receiving the report, they can immediately guide prevention and control, so that insect plagues do not spread. In addition to relying on the information network organization, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station sends cadres to participate in the pest control work in areas with serious plant diseases and insect pests at any time. It also uses the information organization to notify various places to be vigilant, step up prevention, and put forward various prevention and control methods according to the season, guide the prevention and control in various places, and answer questions from various places. Relying on the method of communication guidance, the work of tobacco and water control of cotton aphids has been universally carried out in various places. Linquan County in northern Anhui also used the method of stacking grass to attract and capture, preventing and controlling more than 4,000 mu of subterranean cutworms.

In addition, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station also paid attention to contact with other Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Stations. Through the Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Administrative Offices, it worked in conjunction with the Bengbu Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station and the Huaiyin Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, achieving division of labor and cooperation regardless of region. It has sent personnel to help complete pest control tasks in the locust eradication campaign many times.

2. Organizing the Masses to Prevent and Control Plant Diseases and Eliminate Insect Pests: After the information network was set up, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, according to its established policy, used most of its strength to participate in the mass pest control movement. It assisted or organized the pest control headquarters in various places. Since the establishment of the station in late April, it has dispatched personnel to participate in the pest control work for five months, according to the information from various places. The areas it has visited include Shandong, Xuzhou, Tongbei, Tongshan, Tancheng, Huashan, Fengxian, Baiyan, Yixian, Jibei, Nanpi, Dongguang, Wuqiao, Jining, Lincheng, Peixian, Tengxian, Zouxian, Linshu, Ganyu, Northern Jiangsu, Huai'an, Guanyun, Northern Anhui, Dangshan, Suxian, Fengtai, Sihong and other twenty-five counties, a total of twenty-four plant disease and insect pest control campaigns. In terms of the types of plant diseases and insect pests controlled, there are locusts, wheat sawfly, armyworm, cotton aphid, red spider, leafhopper, cricket, vegetable aphid, millet stem borer, rice locust, wheat bunt and other diseases and pests, totaling about 178,000 mu, mobilizing more than 254,900 people, and catching more than 94,600 jin of insects. Among them, locusts occurred in eleven counties, mobilizing more than 200,000 people, and catching more than 86,000 jin of locusts. With the joint efforts of local governments, the task of eliminating the locust plague was guaranteed.

In addition, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station also assisted the Northern Anhui Seed Company in handling 600,000 jin of wheat seeds, and participated in the seed mixing work in Tengxian, Linshu, and Ganyu counties, focusing on preventing the occurrence of wheat bunt in the coming year. The reason why the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station was able to achieve these results is inseparable from combining with administration. The establishment of various information stations mainly relied on administrative institutions, and the pest control headquarters in various places were mostly responsible by the main responsible cadres of the counties and districts. When plant diseases and insect pests occurred, most of the cadres were organized to go to the countryside and become the central work of administration. Therefore, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station must rely on the organization of the information network and closely combine with the pest control headquarters in various places to complete the plant disease and insect pest control tasks.

Due to the lack of accuracy or timeliness of information in some areas, there are still many shortcomings in the work. Yunfeng District of Sihong County reported the occurrence of locusts without inspection. After the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station dispatched three technical cadres with 2,000 jin of 666 and sixteen powder sprayers to the district, it was found that only a few local locusts had occurred, resulting in a waste of manpower and materials.

3. Experimentation and Research: While promoting prevention and control, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station also paid attention to drug efficacy testing to ensure that there would be no technical deviations in the promotion work, and hoped to gradually understand some plant diseases and insect pests for which there are currently no good prevention and control methods. In terms of experimentation and research, it combined with the farm and established contact with the East China Institute of Agricultural Sciences. It shared some observation and simple experimental work. In the past six months, it has successively conducted drug efficacy tests on eight kinds of insect pests, including local locusts, subterranean cutworms, crickets, cotton aphids and other important pests. In addition, it conducted surveys of plant diseases and insect pests in various places in conjunction with the establishment of an information network, which directly helped this year's plant disease and insect pest control work.

4. Publicity and Education: In order to raise the attention of local governments and eliminate the masses' reliance on the weather, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, in addition to all organizational work (such as the establishment of an information network and inspection work, etc.), also tried its best to use written publicity such as newspapers and manuals to urge local actions.

In addition, in order to introduce scientific methods and knowledge more widely to the masses and improve their interest and confidence, it also cooperated with the Xuzhou Farm to participate in the Taishan Temple Fair (Mule and Horse Fair, in the southern suburbs of Xuzhou) held by the Xuzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, publicizing scientific knowledge about plant diseases and insect pests and methods of insect control. Within twelve days, 100,000 people visited. In the exhibition, farmers enthusiastically inquired about the prevention and control methods of various plant diseases and insect pests, and urgently needed the supply of medicines and machinery. They all wanted to know where they could buy these things. Facts have proved that when they understand scientific principles, they can gradually eliminate the idea of relying on the weather or superstition and are willing to accept scientific methods. The successive insect control campaigns have also fully demonstrated that when the masses understand, especially after seeing the actual results, they are happy to accept. The Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station paid attention to the publicity and education work for the masses, using various meetings or forums in the insect control to enable farmers not only to participate in the insect control, but also to gain a correct understanding of plant diseases and insect pests.

(III) Experience and Problems:

The Xuzhou Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station combined with local governments to achieve significant results in plant disease and insect pest control. For the station itself, the staffing of cadres and the promotion of all station work were relatively standardized. It established prestige among the masses and cadres in many places. However, since the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station is still a new work, there are still shortcomings in this year's work:

(1) Due to the wide jurisdiction and excessive expansion, the work often presents a phenomenon of neglecting one thing for another. The locust occurrence areas are mostly lakeshore wastelands with few residents, inconvenient transportation, and administratively under the jurisdiction of two administrative offices in one province. The problem is relatively complex, so some work is not good enough. Some places have very late or no reports at all, or have not been discovered. For example, in Tongbei, the west bank of Weishan Lake, there were three areas of grassland where locusts occurred. Part of it had become winged locusts taking off when it was discovered. In individual places, inaccurate reports caused waste.

(2) Simultaneously with excessive expansion and neglecting one thing for another, the work is not thorough enough. Although cadres were dispatched to some places, they were only assisting in deployment or conducting roving guidance. They could not work in depth from beginning to end, and even in many places they could only deploy work by communication. Due to the lack of understanding of the local situation, deviations or formalism are inevitable.

(3) The Xuzhou Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station is led by the central government, East China, Shandong and other parties, and sometimes feels at a loss. The funding subsidies and expenditures have different regulations, and some work is not dare to be carried out freely, forming delays, such as the enrichment of experimental equipment, in addition to the farm and the province passing, it must also be submitted to the central government for approval. The leadership in the work is also difficult to unify, such as the central government requiring aphid control, and the provincial party requiring seed selection.

(4) In terms of combining with administration in the work of the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, most places have achieved smooth mass insect control campaigns by relying on local governments and insect control headquarters. However, according to the current conditions in all aspects, it is felt that relying solely on communication guidance or roving guidance is still far from enough. It is necessary to work in depth, discover and solve practical problems in the work, in order to achieve higher results and truly hand over the technology to the masses.

In this regard, the supply of medicines and machinery, the organizational structure, and the mastery of technology are all very important. How to closely cooperate with the medicine and machinery supply agencies in various places, especially like the Xuzhou Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station, which spans three administrative regions, is even more complicated. Relying on those organizations, can the medicines and machinery be used to maximize the effectiveness and enable the masses to master the technology? ... Because most areas used the method of catching and killing this year, these issues have not been well addressed.

(5) Because the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests should not become a surprise attack, the Plant Disease and Insect Pest Control Station must be a long-term institution. Whether it is in the staffing of cadres, the budgeting of funds, and various tasks, there should be long-term plans, so that regular work can be carried out and greater effects can be exerted, and gradually move towards prevention being more important than cure. To this end, how to make this permanent institution not overlap with other institutions, but to closely combine and unify leadership, relying on other institutions but also able to complete its independent tasks, still needs to be further studied and improved.

    介绍山东徐州病虫防治站
     （一）成立经过：
    山东徐州防治站，于今年四月下旬正式成立，并根据中央指示，确定以协助各地政府防治蝗虫及其他重要病虫害为主要任务。工作地区包括鲁中南及苏北皖北一带，站址设于徐州农业试验场内，干部之配备，除由省实业厅派出五人及由徐州农场拨出推广员三人到站工作外，中央农业部及华东农林部均曾派有技术干部协助工作。正副站长由农场正副场长兼任。
    因为防治站是初次设立，没有基础，故一切工作暂与农场结合，工作中并强调指出，要学习群众防除病虫经验，并加强科学技术指导，以开展群众性的防病灭虫运动。
  （二）几项主要工作：
    １、建立情报网：由于蝗虫的分布遍及徐州附近，鲁中南、苏北、皖北三个行政区域，在治虫工作中较比复杂，工作范围广大，病虫种类繁多，所以徐州站特别注意了情报联系的问题，把建立情报网，及时掌握各地病虫情况列为本年主要工作之一，于站务工作就绪后，即抓紧时间分赴各蝗区进行检查，并与各地政府取得联系，建立以防治站为中心的报告制度。
    情报网以县为主要单位，依靠各级农场或政府，专县设情报站，区设情报员，村依靠捕虫委员会等，均有专人负责。在防治站的积极推动下，两个月中共建立三十四个专县情报站（山东十九个，苏北八个，皖北七个），此外并与苏北、皖北两行署经常联系。在病虫情况的掌握上，起了一定的作用。山东华山县情报站成立后，除了负责报告之外，并直接领导群众捕打虫害，皖北泗洪县亦有极严密的情报组织，县情报站下设区情报大队，村中则设两个情报小组，分区负责检查及报告，因此县与站间都能作到发生虫灾立刻报告，接到报告后，又能马上指导防治，使虫灾不致蔓延。防治站除了依靠情报网的组织，随时派出干部参加病虫严重区域的治虫工作外，还利用了情报组织，按照季节通知各地提高警惕，加紧预防，并提出各种防治办法，指导各地防治和解答各地问题，依靠通讯指导的方法，各地普遍展开了烟草水治棉蚜的工作，皖北临泉县并用堆草诱杀和捕捉的办法，防治了四千余亩地蚕。
    此外，防治站还注意了与其他防治站的联系，通过苏北、皖北两行署与蚌埠防治站和淮阴防治站结合工作，作到了不分地区，分工合作，在灭蝗运动中曾多次派员前往帮助共同完成了灭虫任务。
    ２、组织群众防病除虫：情报网设置之后，防治站根据既定方针，以大部力量参加了群众性的治虫运动。协助或组织各地的除虫指挥部工作，自四月下旬站成立后，五个月的中间，根据各地情报，派员参加了除虫工作，所到地区有山东、徐州、铜北、铜山、郯城、华山、丰县、白彦、峄县、济北、南皮、东光、吴桥、济宁、临城、沛县、滕县、邹县、临沭、赣榆、苏北、淮安、灌云、皖北、砀山、宿县、凤台、泗洪等二十五县，共组织了二十四次的病虫防治运动。从防治病虫害种类上分有蝗虫、麦叶蜂、行军虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、浮尘子、蟋蟀、菜蚜、谷子钻心虫，稻蝗、小麦腥黑穗病等，共约十七万八千余亩，动员群众二十五万四千九百余人，捉虫达九万四千六百余斤。其中蝗虫有十一县发生，动员群众二十余万人，捉蝗八万六千余斤。在各地政府的共同努力下，保证了消灭蝗灾的任务。
    此外防治站还协助皖北种子公司，处理了六十万斤的小麦种子，有重点的参加了滕县、临沭、赣榆等县的拌种工作，预防来年腥黑穗病的发生。防治站所以能够得到这些成绩是与结合行政分不开的，各情报站的建立主要依靠了行政机构，各地的灭虫指挥部又多为县区的主要负责干部负责，病虫发生时并组织多数干部下乡而成为行政上的中心工作，所以防治站必须依靠情报网的组织，并密切结合各地的灭虫指挥部，才能完成病虫防治任务。
    由于若干地区的情报不够确实或不及时，工作中还存在着不少缺点，泗洪县云枫区报告蝗虫发生后未经检查即行报告，待防治站派出技术干部三人携六六六两千斤，喷粉器十六架驰往该区后，始见仅有少数土蝗发生，造成了人力物力的浪费。
    ３、试验研究：在推广防治之同时，防治站还注意了药效试验，以保证推广工作中不生技术上的偏差，并希望逐步了解一些目前还没有良好防治方法的病虫害，在试验研究方面与农场结合并与华东农业科学研究所取得联系。分担若干观察和简单的试验工作。半年来曾先后举行了八种虫害的药效试验，包括土蝗、地蚕、蟋蟀、棉蚜等重要害虫。此外与建立情报网结合进行了各地病虫害的调查，都直接帮助了今年的病虫防治工作。
    ４、宣传教育：为了提起各地政府的重视，消除群众的靠天思想。防治站除了通过一切组织工作（如情报网的建立以及检查工作等）外，还尽量利用报纸手册等文字宣传，督促各地行动。
    此外为了把科学方法和知识更广泛的介绍给群众，提高他们的兴趣与信心，还配合徐州农场参加了徐州市工商联合会举办的泰山庙会（骡马大会，在徐市南郊），宣传病虫害的科学知识和治虫方法，十二天内参观群众达十万人。展览会中农民们都热情的询问各种病虫害的防治办法，并且迫切需要药械的供应，他们都想知道什么地方可以买到这些东西。事实证明，当他们了解了科学道理以后，便可以逐渐消除靠天或迷信的思想。并愿意接受科学方法的，在历次的治虫运动中也充分说明，当群众了解，特别是看到实际的效果之后，无不乐于接受，防治站注意到对群众的宣传教育工作，在治虫中利用各种会议或座谈的方式，使农民不仅是参加了治虫而已，还要得到对病虫害的正确认识。
  （三）经验及问题：
    徐州防治站与各地政府结合，在病虫防治中收到了显著效果，在站的本身来说，干部的配备以及一切站务工作的推动，均较正规，在很多地方的群众和干部中树立了威信，但是由于防治站还是一个新的工作，在今年的工作中还不无缺点：
    （１）由于辖区太广，铺张过大，工作中常呈现顾此失彼的现象。蝗虫发生区域又多属湖边荒地，居民较少，交通不便，行政上又属于一个省份两个行署辖区。问题较比复杂，所以有些工作还不够好，有些地方消息很迟或根本不报或未被发觉，如铜北，微山湖西岸，草地三处，发生蝗虫，其中一部待发现时已成飞蝗起飞，个别地方则由于报告不确，造成浪费现象。
    （２）与铺张过大和顾此失彼同时产生出工作的不够深入，有些地方虽是派出了干部，但亦不过是协同布置或巡回指导而已，不能自始至终深入工作，甚至很多地方则只能以通讯的方法布置工作，由于对当地情况的不了解难免偏差或趋于形式。
    （３）徐州防治站工作中受中央、华东、山东等多方面领导，有时感到无所适从，经费补助与开支，各有不同规定，有些工作就不敢放手而形成拖延，如试验设备的充实，除了农场和省通过外，还必须呈请中央批准。工作中领导亦难统一，如中央要求治蚜，省方要求选种。
    （４）防治站工作在与行政结合上，多数地方作到了依靠各地政府与除虫指挥部结合，而顺利展开群众性的除虫运动，但按照目前各方面的条件，感到单凭通讯指导或巡回式的指导还是很不够的，必须深入工作，发现并解决工作中的实际问题，才能收到更高的效果。并真正把技术交予群众。
    在这方面，药械的供应上，组织机构上，以及技术的掌握上，都是非常重要的，如何与各地的药械供应机构密切配合，特别是像徐州防治站地跨三个行政区域，则更复杂，依靠那些组织，可以使药械发挥最大的效力，并使群众掌握技术？……因为今年多数地区是用了捕打的方法，对这些问题还没有很好的注意。
    （５）因为病虫害的防治不应成为突击工作，所以防治站必须是长期性的机构，无论在干部的配备上，经费的预算上，以及各种工作上都应有长期打算，这样才能进行经常的工作并发挥更大的效果，逐步走到防重于治，为此，如何使这常设机构不与其他机构重叠，但要密切结合并统一领导，依靠其他机构而又能完成其独立的任务，还是须要继续研究改进的。
