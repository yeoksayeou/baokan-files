    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to a report from Electra News Agency in Rome, the Italian Communist Party issued a communique on the 7th, calling on the Italian people to unite broadly to defend peace, the rights and freedoms of the people. The communique first alerted the masses to the grave situation created by the threat of a new US aggressive war and to the danger of the Gasperi government's unconditional support for the aggressive plans of US imperialism. The communique then emphasized that the massive protest movement has spread throughout Italy, which once again proves that the broad masses oppose the war policy. The communique went on to denounce the Italian government's economic policies, which attempt to plunge the people into ruin, and its attacks on the people's rights and freedoms, pointing out that this is part of the war preparations, and calling on the people to act in unison against the danger of fascism.
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to TASS, Paris, 8th: The Central Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor recently issued a communique, calling on all working people and all peace advocates to unite and continue their struggle to protest Truman's intimidation of expanding the aggressive war, and to demand that France be freed from the rule of US imperialism, first of all demanding that the US occupation forces withdraw from the ports of Bordeaux and La Rochelle-La Pallice.
    The communique stated: "This struggle is more necessary now than ever before, given the war-mongers' accelerated war preparations." The French "working class will never allow capitalists from across the Atlantic to realize their policy of dominating the world, will never allow the rulers of France to keep our people in a state of constant fear, will never allow the fate of our people to be handed over to a handful of adventurers, and will never allow the working people to accept new tax burdens in order to implement war preparations that violate French interests."
    The communique exposed the collusion of the French rulers with the US and British war-mongers in rearming West Germany, demanded the implementation of a peaceful policy, the withdrawal of French troops slaughtering the people in Vietnam, the recognition of the independence of the Vietnamese people, and denounced the government and state-owned enterprise management agencies for refusing to negotiate with the representatives of the various organizations of the General Confederation of Labor regarding the demands of the working people.
    Xinhua News Agency: TASS, New York, 10th: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Fifth UN General Assembly, recently submitted to Assembly President Andrian the text of a telegram he received from Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation.
    The telegram, representing 91 million women from 59 countries, expressed a vehement protest against Truman's statement at a press conference on November 30. The International Democratic Women's Federation urged the Security Council to condemn this absurd statement made by a representative of a member of the Security Council.
    Vyshinsky requested the President of the UN General Assembly to distribute this telegram as a document of the Assembly to the delegations of various countries.

    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社罗马讯，意大利共产党在七日发表公报，号召意大利人民广泛团结起来，保卫和平、人民的权利与自由。公报首先唤起群众注意美国新侵略战争的威胁所造成的严重局势，注意加斯贝利政府无条件支持美帝国主义侵略计划的危险性。公报接着着重指出：声势浩大的抗议运动已经扩展到意大利全国，这再次证明了广大群众反对战争政策。公报进而痛斥意大利政府企图使人民陷于毁灭的经济政策和对人民权利与自由的进攻，指出这是战争准备的一部分，并号召人民一致行动，反对法西斯化的危险。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八日讯：法国总工会中央委员会顷发表公报，号召全体劳动人民和一切和平拥护者联合起来，再接再厉地进行斗争，抗议杜鲁门扩大侵略战争的恫吓，并要求使法国摆脱美帝国主义的统治，首先是要求美国占领军退出波尔多和罗舍尔拉巴利斯港。
    公报称：“鉴于战争贩子加速备战，这种斗争目前比以往更为必要了。”法国“工人阶级决不允许大西洋彼岸的资本家实现独霸世界的政策，决不允许法国的统治者使我国人民处于经常恐惧的状态之中，决不允许把我国人民的命运交给一小撮冒险家的手中，决不允许为了实行违反法国利益的备战政策而强迫劳动人民接受新的赋税负担。”
    公报揭露了法国统治者在重新武装西德方面与美英战争贩子的狼狈为奸，要求实行和平政策、撤回在越南屠杀人民的法军、承认越南人民独立，并指斥政府与国营企业管理机构拒绝与总工会各组织的代表就劳动人民的要求进行谈判。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十日电：出席第五届联合国大会苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，顷将他所收到的国际民主妇女联盟总书记古久里夫人来电一份递交大会主席安迪让。
    这份电报代表五十九国的九千一百万妇女对杜鲁门于十一月三十日在记者招待会中的声明表示猛烈的抗议。国际民主妇联敦促安全理事会谴责这一安全理事会会员国的代表所作的这种荒谬声明。
    维辛斯基要求联合国大会主席把这份电报当作大会的文件散发给各国代表团。
