    【Report from this newspaper】The Beijing Church Groups, Schools, Hospitals, and Returned Students Anti-Austin Slander Demonstration Rally passed a message of respect to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The message stated: First, allow us to express our warmest respect and greetings to you! Thanks to your heroic fighting, you have victoriously crushed the so-called "total offensive" of the American aggressors, and have enabled the heroic historical city of Pyongyang to regain its liberation, dealing a heavy blow to the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand their aggression.

    But the US imperialists not only show no repentance for their aggressive acts, but also arbitrarily reverse right and wrong, trying to cover the eyes and ears of the world with a pair of blood-stained hands. The shameless speech given by Austin, a running dog of Wall Street, at the Security Council on November 28th, is one of the most insane examples of this; in addition to recklessly proposing blood-soaked relief supplies and other forms of cultural aggression to insult the Chinese people, he also specifically mentioned the schools and hospitals run by the US imperialists through the church in China, as well as Chinese students studying in the United States, to make even more malicious slanders against us. But although we have different beliefs and different work positions, we are all children of the great People's Republic of China, and we must never tolerate such shameless defamation. Today, we are holding this rally and parade to demonstrate and protest against US imperialism.

    Heroic fighters, we are fully supporting you from the rear! In the future, we must further strive to completely crush US imperialist cultural aggression!

    京教会团体学校医院及留美学生示威大会
    电朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致敬
    【本报讯】北京市教会团体学校医院及留美学生反奥斯汀诬蔑示威大游行大会通过向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队致敬电。电文称：首先让我们向你们致最热烈的敬意与慰问！由于你们的英勇作战，已经胜利地击溃了美国侵略军的所谓“总攻势”，已经使英雄的历史古城平壤重获解放，使美帝扩大侵略的阴谋遭到了沉重的打击。
    但美帝不但对它的侵略行为毫不悔改，而且肆意颠倒是非，想以一双血手掩尽天下人的耳目。美国华尔街走卒奥斯汀十一月二十八日在安理会上的无耻演说，就是这种最疯狂的例证之一；他在放肆地提出了沾满血腥气的救济物资和其它文化侵略来侮辱中国人民而外，还特别提到美帝通过教会在中国所办的学校和医院，以及中国的留美学生，向我们作了更恶毒的诬蔑。但我们尽管信仰不同，工作岗位不同，却同是伟大的中华人民共和国的儿女，决不能容忍这种无耻的诽谤，今天我们举行这个大会和游行，就是为了向美帝国主义示威与抗议。
    英勇的战士们，我们在后方全力支援着你们！今后我们一定要进一步为彻底粉碎美帝文化侵略而奋斗！
