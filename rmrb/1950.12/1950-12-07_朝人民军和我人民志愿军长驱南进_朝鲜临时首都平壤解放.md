Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Our correspondent reports from the Korean front: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers liberated Pyongyang today. The invading armies of the United States and other countries, as well as the remnants of the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army, retreated south of Pyongyang. Regular units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Pyongyang City at 2:00 PM on December 6th.

            Introduction to Pyongyang
    Pyongyang is the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a population of over 400,000. The city is located south of the Datong River. About 100 kilometers southwest, through Zhennanpu, one can enter the sea. Railways and highways run through the country, making it the center of politics, economy, transportation, and culture in Korea. The city is one of the oldest in Korea, and served as the capital of the Goguryeo Dynasty. At the end of the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi led troops to invade Korea, and was defeated by the Korean people in Pyongyang.
    On August 15, 1945, after Korea was liberated by the Soviet army, the Korean people, with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, built a new Pyongyang. In the past, Pyongyang did not have a single university. After liberation, Kim Il-sung University, Pyongyang University of Technology, Pyongyang Medical University, Pyongyang Normal University, and other institutions of higher learning were newly established. The largest hospital in Korea, the Central People's Hospital, was also a new construction after liberation. All scenic spots and historical sites have become places for the working people to relax after liberation. Parks, theaters, dance halls, and restaurants have been built on the beautiful Mudan Peak. The Korean people respectfully and affectionately call Pyongyang "the capital of democracy."
    On June 25th of this year, American imperialism instructed the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang to launch the Korean War, declaring that they would occupy Pyongyang within three days. After this plan was crushed by the Korean people, the planes of the American aggressors continuously carried out indiscriminate bombing of Pyongyang City. Many cultural buildings and the houses of peaceful residents were thus reduced to ruins. On October 20th of this year, after paying a heavy price, more than 60,000 American invading troops occupied Pyongyang. After occupying Pyongyang, the American invading army began a bloody massacre. According to materials published in a protest telegram sent to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council by Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young on November 26th, the American and Li (Syngman Rhee) bandits shot and killed more than 7,000 Korean patriots during their occupation of Pyongyang; the American army also arrested more than 1,000 women in Pyongyang, subjected them to torture, raped them, and then shot them to death. However, the people of Pyongyang did not yield, and they bravely fought against the American invading army. A November 18th dispatch from Pyongyang by the International News Service of the United States admitted that under the American occupation of Pyongyang, "gun battles have become commonplace."
    Now, under the victorious counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, this brave and unyielding city has returned to the hands of the Korean people. [Xinhua News Agency]

    朝人民军和我人民志愿军长驱南进  朝鲜临时首都平壤解放
    【新华社六日讯】本社记者从朝鲜前线报道：朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军本日解放平壤。美国和其他国家的侵略军以及李承晚匪军残部，向平壤以南溃退，朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军的正规部队，于十二月六日下午二时进入平壤城。
            平壤介绍
    平壤为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都，人口四十余万。市区南面大同江，往西南约一百公里出镇南浦即可入海，有铁路及公路贯通全国，为朝鲜政治、经济、交通、文化的中心。该城为朝鲜最古城市之一，高句丽王朝即以此为首都。十六世纪末叶，日本丰臣秀吉率军侵略朝鲜，曾在平壤被朝鲜人民击败。
    一九四五年八月十五日，朝鲜为苏军解放后，朝鲜人民在伟大苏联协助之下，建设起新的平壤。过去平壤没有一所大学，解放后，已新设了金日成大学、平壤工业大学、平壤医学大学、平壤师范大学等高等学校。朝鲜最大的医院中央人民医院亦为解放后的新建设。所有名胜古迹，解放后都变成了劳动人民游息之所。美丽的牡丹峰顶已建立起公园、剧场、舞厅、餐厅。朝鲜人民尊敬而又亲切地称平壤为“民主之京”。
    今年六月二十五日，美帝国主义指使李承晚匪帮发动了朝鲜战争，扬言在三天之内占领平壤。在这一计划被朝鲜人民粉碎以后，美国侵略者的飞机即对平壤市不断进行盲目的滥炸。许多文化建筑与和平居民的房舍，因而夷为废墟。今年十月二十日，美国侵略军六万余人在付出重大的代价后，侵占了平壤。美国侵略军在占领平壤后，即开始进行血腥的大屠杀，据朝鲜外务相朴宪永十一月二十六日致联合国大会和安全理事会的抗议电所公布的材料，美、李匪帮在占领平壤期间枪毙朝鲜爱国人士共达七千余人；美国军队在平壤还逮捕了一千多名妇女，对她们施以酷刑，强奸她们，然后把她们枪杀。但是，平壤的人民没有屈服，他们勇敢地向美国侵略军进行斗争。美国的国际新闻社平壤十一月十八日电曾经承认，美军占领下的平壤，“枪击战成了司空见惯的事情”。
    现在，在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的胜利反攻下，这座勇敢不屈的城市，又回到朝鲜人民的手中来了。【新华社】
