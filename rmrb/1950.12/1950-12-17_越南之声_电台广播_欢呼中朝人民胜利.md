    "Voice of Vietnam" Radio Broadcast
    Hails Victory of Chinese and Korean People
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] According to Vietnam News Agency: "Voice of Vietnam" radio station commented on the recent great victories achieved by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the 11th, saying: "The current situation in Korea has taught a valuable lesson to all people. This situation is another proof of the invincible power of the people. Imperialists can never conquer a nation fighting for its freedom. The French imperialists, after five years of costly war in Vietnam, have not learned this harsh lesson, which is now being tasted by the American aggressors thanks to the Korean people."
    "Voice of Vietnam" radio station stated: "Amidst the frenzied anxiety of international reactionaries, the Vietnamese people, together with the people of all democratic countries, are hailing the victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They rejoice in the liberation of many Korean towns and are even more delighted by the losses suffered by the American aggressors at the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army."

    “越南之声”电台广播            
    欢呼中朝人民胜利
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台于十一日评论朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军最近取得的伟大胜利称：“朝鲜目前的局势，给所有的人民上了宝贵的一课，这种局势是人民的不可战胜的力量的又一证明。帝国主义者永远不能征服一个为了争取自由而战的民族。法国帝国主义在越南经过五年耗费巨大的战争还没有学得的这个严酷的教训，正由朝鲜人民给予美国侵略者尝受。”
    “越南之声”电台称：“在国际反动派狂乱的焦急中，越南人民正与所有民主国家的人民一起，欢呼朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的胜利。他们为了许多朝鲜城镇的解放而欢欣鼓舞，他们更为朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军使美国侵略者遭受的损失而欣欢鼓舞。”
