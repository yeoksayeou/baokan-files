Column: Reaction to People's Daily Criticism

To the Editors:

Regarding the criticism made by Comrade Tan Shaoyi, a technician in our factory's forging workshop, about our leadership style (as published in the People's Garden section of this newspaper on October 7th), we not only sincerely accept and correct it but also express our gratitude to Comrade Tan. We hereby report to your newspaper the results of our self-examination and corrections under the leadership of higher authorities.

Our factory was taken over at the beginning of December last year. Some equipment was damaged by the enemy during their retreat, but thanks to the correct leadership of the Southwest Industrial Department and the active repair efforts of all employees, work gradually resumed from April this year. In our work, we did indeed have some serious bureaucratic and commandist work styles that were divorced from the masses and reality. We have rigorously examined and self-criticized these errors in the rectification movement led by the Southwest Bureau and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee in September and have formulated methods for correction.

It is true that the work of democratizing management was not done well, and the Factory Management Committee became a mere formality. It is also true that the full committee of the Factory Management Committee, established in May, only met three times in the three months until September. Moreover, we did not pay enough attention to the suggestions put forward by the staff and workers. Since September, there have been some adjustments to our leading comrades. We have now decided that the standing committee of the Factory Management Committee will meet once a week to discuss major production plans within the factory and implement democratic management. We have attached importance to the opinions of our staff and workers and are awarding bonuses for rationalization proposals and technical improvements based on their contribution value. However, this is not to say that there are no shortcomings. We must continue to improve gradually in the future.

The work style of the head of the cadre section is not good. This comrade lacks self-restraint and becomes impatient when faced with busy work. For example, because a few workers accused a foreman of embezzling processing wages, the head of the cadre section ordered the foreman's dismissal without in-depth investigation, which aroused dissatisfaction among all the workers in that workshop. The criticism that the administrative leaders are indifferent to the lives of the workers and that the workers do not have good places to rest and enjoy themselves is true and correct.

In the past, we also did a very poor job of political and cultural education for our staff and workers. Recently, our factory has undergone a mass movement to rectify discipline and teaching, and a one-hour daily study system has been established. The trade union has added several libraries and reading rooms, and workers can now watch a movie or play almost every week.

### 重庆第廿九兵工厂接受批评改进工作

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    重庆第廿九兵工厂接受批评改进工作编辑同志：
    我厂锻工场技术员谭绍仪同志对我们领导作风的批评（按载于本报十月七日人民园地栏），我们除诚恳接受和改正外，并向谭同志致谢。兹将我们在上级领导下检查和改正情形报告给贵报。
    我厂是从去年十二月初开始接管，部分设备在敌人溃退时被破坏了，但由于西南工业部的正确领导和全厂员工积极的修复，在本年四月起陆续开工。在工作中我们确实存在某些严重的脱离群众脱离实际的官僚主义和命令主义作风。这些错误，我们已在西南局及重庆市委领导的在九月份的整风运动中，严格地进行了检查和自我批评，并订出了改正的方法。
    管理民主化的工作做的不好，工管会成为形式确是事实。自五月成立的工厂管理委员会到九月的三个月内，只开过三次全体委员会，这也是事实。并且对职工提出的建议是重视不够的。九月以后，我们领导同志有些调整，现在我们已决定工管会常委会每礼拜召开一次，讨论厂内重大生产计划及贯彻民主管理问题，重视了职工同志的意见。并在合理化建议及改进技术中按贡献价值发给奖金。但不是说没有缺点了，今后我们还须逐步改进。
    干部科长工作作风，是不好的。该同志涵养不够，遇繁忙工作时，性情就急躁。如因为有少数工人控告领工贪污加工工资，干部科长未加深入调查即命令撤销该领工职务，而引起该场全体工人不满。行政领导对职工生活，是采取不关心态度，工人没有好的休息和娱乐场所，这个批评是事实，也是正确的。
    职工的政治文化教育，过去做的也是很差，最近我厂经过了群众性的整顿纪律和教学运动，每天一小时学习制度已经建立。工会增设了几处图书馆及阅览室，并且差不多职工们每周可看一次电影或戏剧。
                                重庆第二十九兵工厂副厂长赵文刚
                                                十一月二十四日
