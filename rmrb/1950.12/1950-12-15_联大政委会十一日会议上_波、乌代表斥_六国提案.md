Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th. According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the slanderous case of the so-called "Chinese Communist intervention in Korea" on December 11th.

    Polish representative Wierblowski stated at the meeting that the accusations against the People's Republic of China were absolutely untenable. The claim that Chinese regular army troops are fighting in Korea is baseless. Everyone knows that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting in the ranks of the Korean People's Army, and they are only assisting the Korean patriots in their struggle against the aggressors. They are all volunteers, so no one has any reason to accuse the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China of interfering in Korea. The Six-Nation Proposal is an attempt to distort the essence of the issue. The Polish delegation believes that if the United Nations hopes to maintain its greatly diminished prestige, it must refuse to follow the policy of the United States and reject this proposal. The Polish delegation supports the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation to strive to create conditions for the re-establishment of peace, unity, and independence in Korea based on the principle of national self-determination.

    Ukrainian representative Baranovsky, in referring to the false accusation of the Chinese people's "intervention" in Korea, pointed out that the Political Committee, in violation of the United Nations Charter, is deliberating on accusations against those fabricated as aggressors, while the real aggressor, the United States, has been destroying peaceful and freedom-loving Korea for more than five months. Baranovsky stated that the Ukrainian delegation believes that the Political Committee should not now discuss the fabricated issue of the so-called People's Republic of China's intervention in Korea, but should discuss the issue of the American attack on Korea and the People's Republic of China, as well as the American attempt to launch a war against China. The General Assembly must not allow American imperialism to use the United Nations as a screen to cover up its aggression against Korea and China. The fact that the American ruling clique is still continuing to drive the United Nations towards finally losing its international prestige and going bankrupt politically is intolerable. The Ukrainian delegation fully supports and is willing to vote in favor of the Soviet proposal that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from Korea and that the Korean people be allowed to solve the Korean issue themselves.

    The meeting on the 11th, like the previous few days' meetings, still only had a sparse few representatives from the US-British bloc countries speaking in support of the Six-Nation Proposal.

    联大政委会十一日会议上
    波、乌代表斥“六国提案”
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十二月十一日继续讨论所谓“中华人民共和国干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案。
    波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基在会上发言指出，对中华人民共和国的控诉是绝对站不住脚的。所谓中国正规军部队在朝鲜作战的说法是毫无根据的。大家都知道，中国人民志愿军是在朝鲜人民军的行列中战斗的，他们只是为了协助朝鲜爱国者反对侵略者的斗争。他们都是志愿者，所以任何人都没有任何理由来控告中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜。而六国提案乃是企图歪曲问题的本质。波兰代表团认为：如果联合国希望维持它的已经大大失坠了的威信的话，它必须拒绝追随美国的政策，并否决这项提案。波兰代表团支持苏联代表团提出的力求创造条件以按照民族自决原则重新建立朝鲜的和平、统一与独立的提案。
    乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基在论及诬告中国人民“干涉”朝鲜时指出，政治委员会违背联合国宪章，进行审议对于被虚构为侵略者的控诉，而真正侵略者的美国五个多月以来一直在摧毁和平的与爱好自由的朝鲜。巴拉诺夫斯基称：乌克兰代表团认为，现在政委会不应该讨论捏造的所谓中华人民共和国干涉朝鲜的问题，而应该讨论美国进攻朝鲜和中华人民共和国、以及美国企图对中国发动战争的问题。大会决不能容许美帝国主义利用联合国作为帷幕来掩饰其对朝鲜和中国的侵略。美国统治集团仍在继续将联合国驱向最后丧尽其国际威信并在政治上破产的道路，这种事实是不能容忍的。乌克兰代表团完全支持并且愿意投票赞成苏联所提出的建议一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜、并让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    十一日会议和前几天会议一样，仍然只有稀稀落落的几个美英集团国家代表发言支持六国提案。
