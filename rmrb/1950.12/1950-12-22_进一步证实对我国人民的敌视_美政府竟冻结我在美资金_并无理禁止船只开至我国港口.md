Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - The U.S. government, suffering a serious defeat in its aggression against Korea, has announced the freezing of our funds in the United States after its threats and blackmail against the Chinese people failed. This unreasonable measure by the U.S. ruling class to infringe upon the rights and interests of the Chinese people further confirms its hostility towards the Chinese people. The U.S. government also announced a ban on U.S. ships sailing to Chinese ports. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the night of the 16th, stating: "The U.S. government today took measures to place all Communist Chinese property within U.S. jurisdiction under control and issued regulations prohibiting ships registered in the United States from sailing to Communist Chinese ports."

    进一步证实对我国人民的敌视
    美政府竟冻结我在美资金
    并无理禁止船只开至我国港口
    【新华社二十一日讯】侵略朝鲜遭到严重失败的美国政府，当它对我国人民的恫吓讹诈破产之后，竟宣布冻结我国在美资金。美国统治阶级这一侵犯我国人民权益的无理措施进一步证实了它对我国人民的敌视。美国政府同时宣布禁止美国船只开至我国港口。美国国务院于十六日夜发表公告称：“美国政府今日采取措施，将美国辖区内的一切共产党中国财产置于管制之下，并颁发条例，禁止在美国注册的船只驶往共产党中国港口。”
