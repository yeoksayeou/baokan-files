Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the following statement regarding the US government's illegal trial of American Communist leaders:

    The US government is plotting to outlaw the legal existence of the American Communist Party and is constantly persecuting the leaders and members of the American Communist Party. The unreasonable verdict handed down by the New York Federal Court last October against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party is a particularly obvious example. Now, the US Supreme Court is scheduled to begin hearing their appeal on December 4th, and the US Department of Justice is attempting to invoke the reactionary McCarran Act passed in September against them. These measures are a complete insult to basic human rights and are bound to be opposed by the American people and the people of the world.

    While expanding its foreign aggression, American imperialism is intensifying its suppression of its own people. All of America's reactionary laws and measures are aimed not only at the American Communist Party, but also at all progressive organizations and individuals. This does not indicate the strength of the American ruling class, but rather demonstrates its cowardice. It is the enemy of the American people and the enemy of the people of the world. In today's world, where the power of the people is unprecedentedly strong, it has no choice but to shed its hypocritical democratic cloak, reveal its ugly true colors, and further attack the people, turning the United States into a fascist police state.

    This Federation, on behalf of all the working people of China, demands that the US Supreme Court overturn the verdict against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, unconditionally restore their freedom, and cease all persecution of the American Communist Party and all progressive organizations and individuals who are fighting unyieldingly for the interests of the people. In the struggle to defend world peace and oppose a new world war, the Chinese working people will forever stand with the American working people and firmly believe that victory belongs to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Our All-China Federation of Trade Unions cabled the US Supreme Court on the 3rd, demanding the reversal of the unreasonable verdict against Dennis and the other eleven American Communist leaders. The text of the cable is as follows:

    We, on behalf of the entire Chinese working people, firmly demand that you reverse the unreasonable verdict against Dennis and the other eleven American Communist leaders and unconditionally restore their freedom.

        All-China Federation of Trade Unions
        December 3rd

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Our All-China Federation of Trade Unions cabled the National Committee of the American Communist Party on the 3rd, expressing support for the struggle against the trial of the eleven American Communist leaders. The text of the cable is as follows:

    On behalf of the Chinese working class, we fully support your struggle against the unreasonable verdict of the US Federal Court against Comrade Dennis and the other eleven comrades, and wish you victory.

            All-China Federation of Trade Unions
            December 3rd

    斥美政府迫害美共领袖
    电美最高法院要求撤销无理判决
    电美共表示全力支持反审判斗争
    【新华社四日讯】中华全国总工会就美国政府非法审判美共领袖一事发表声明如下：
    美国政府阴谋取缔美共的合法存在，不断对美共的领导人及其党员进行迫害。去年十月纽约联邦法院对美共十一位领袖的无理的判决，即是极其明显的例证。现在美国最高法院定于十二月四日开始对他们的上诉进行审判，美国司法部并企图对他们援用九月间通过的反动的麦卡伦法案，这些措施完全是对人类基本权利的侮辱，必定遭到美国人民和全世界人民一致的反对。
    美国帝国主义在扩大对外侵略的同时，更加紧对其本国人民的镇压。美国全部反动的法律和反动的措施，不仅针对着美国共产党，也针对着一切进步组织和进步人士。这并不表明美国统治阶级力量的强大，恰恰说明它的怯弱。它是美国人民的敌人，也是全世界人民的敌人，在人民力量空前壮大的今天，不得不脱去虚伪的民主外衣，露出丑恶的原形，进一步向人民进攻，把美国变成为一个法西斯警察国家。
    本会代表全中国劳动人民，要求美国高等法院撤销对美共十一位领袖的判决，无条件地恢复他们的自由，并停止对为人民利益不屈不挠地进行着斗争的美国共产党及一切进步组织和个人的任何迫害。在保卫世界和平反对新的世界战争的斗争中，中国劳动人民是永远与美国劳动人民站在一起的，并坚信胜利是属于人民的。
    【新华社四日讯】我中华全国总工会于三日致电美国最高法院，要求撤销对但尼斯等十一位美共领袖的无理判决。电文如下：
    我们代表全中国劳动人民向你坚决要求撤销对但尼斯等十一位美共领袖的无理的判决，并无条件地恢复他们的自由。
      中华全国总工会    十二月三日
    【新华社四日讯】我中华全国总工会于三日致电美国共产党全国委员会，表示支持反对审判十一位美共领袖的斗争。电文如下：
    谨代表中国工人阶级全力支持你们反对美国联邦法院对但尼斯等十一位同志的无理的判决的斗争，并祝你们胜利。
            中华全国总工会    十二月三日
