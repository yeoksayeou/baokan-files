Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 25th (TASS dispatch): The French people of all strata's movement protesting the government's agreement to rearm West Germany is continuing to deepen and expand into a nationwide movement.

The Permanent National Committee of the French "Fighters for Freedom and Peace" Association issued a communique on the 22nd, pointing out that arming West Germany means moving towards a war that will inevitably sacrifice France, and called on the people of the whole country to hold a national referendum to protest the arming of West Germany. The association has set up ballot boxes all over the country and established committees to be responsible for launching the voting movement. The association's chairman, Vercors, also wrote in the weekly magazine *Action* that "arming Germany is a treasonous crime endangering French security," and called for "doing everything possible to thwart this crime."

Large-scale protest movements have spread throughout France. Disregarding police persecution, working people everywhere have held strikes, rallies, marches, and petitions. Among them are the masses of Socialist Party workers who expressed great indignation at the treasonous act of Socialist Party right-wing leader Moch signing the Brussels decision. Workers in many enterprises in the Var department, Saint-Étienne and Saint-Nazaire, workers in the machine factories in Clermont-Ferrand in the Puy-de-Dôme department, and workers in the Joubert-Barber machine factory in Roanne have all stopped work to rally and protest the government's agreement to rearm West Germany, and have elected delegations to present resolutions of the meeting to the provincial authorities. Approximately one hundred delegations of the people of Nice, approximately fifty delegations of working people in the Puy-de-Dôme department, and many delegations from towns in the Gironde and Loir-et-Cher departments have petitioned the National Assembly, members of the provincial and municipal councils, and representatives of the authorities. Grand protest demonstrations have been held in Bordeaux, towns in the Loire and Alpes-Maritimes departments, and many other places throughout the country.

The municipal council of Cahors in the Lot department will pass a resolution declaring "firm opposition to the rebuilding of the German army, no matter what disguise it uses to achieve it."

In the Haute-Saône department, five hundred celebrities have jointly called on the French people to broadly expand the protest movement, and twenty-eight prominent French scientists have also made the same appeal. Many groups and individuals have responded one after another.

The working people of Versailles firmly oppose Eisenhower's attempt to use Versailles as the headquarters for his Atlantic aggressive army. Protest demonstrations have been held in various enterprises and many areas of Versailles, and the workers of the "Mantault" factory have even stopped work many times to express their protest.
