Xinhua News Agency, 1st – With the Central People's Government's special representative Wu Xiuquan attending the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee and the Security Council, and justly accusing the United States of aggression against China to the whole world, the United States representatives to the UN, Dulles, and the permanent representative to the Security Council, Austin, delivered lengthy speeches on November 27th at the UN General Assembly Political Committee's meeting to discuss the Soviet Union's "Accusation of US Aggression Against China" case, and on November 28th at the Security Council's meeting to discuss the "Accusation of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan" case, respectively. They attempted to reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, justify the aggressive behavior of US imperialism, and maliciously insult the Chinese people.

In his speech to the Security Council on November 28th, Austin fundamentally dared not answer China's accusations head-on. He could only repeat Truman's claim that sending the US Seventh Fleet to defend Taiwan was to eliminate "direct threats to the security of the Pacific region." After thus reiterating America’s aggressive ambitions toward Taiwan, Austin turned around and, with lengthy verbiage, shamelessly repeated Acheson's old tune from the "White Paper," talking at length about the so-called "friendship between the Chinese and American people," attempting to shirk responsibility. Austin said: "My government feels displeasure, my government, in view of the long-term close friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, especially disapproves of this attack."

But Austin is completely ignorant of the friendship between the Chinese and American people. The so-called "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people" that he listed one by one are precisely the bloody history of US imperialism's aggression against the Chinese people for the past 100 years, and a slander of the true friendship between the Chinese and American people.

Austin first referred to the "Treaty of Wangxia" in 1844, in which the United States obtained imperialist privileges of "extraterritoriality" and "most-favored-nation treatment" in China, as "maintaining the territorial and administrative integrity of China." Then, Austin called the "Open Door" policy of 1890, in which the United States attempted to divide China with other imperialist countries, the Root-Takahira Agreement of 1908, in which the United States and Japan reached an understanding on their respective aggressive interests in China, and the note of 1915, in which the United States demanded the "most-favored-nation" treatment in Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" for aggression against China, and the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, in which the United States supported Japan's "special interests" in China and supported Japan's occupation of Jiaozhou Bay in 1917, all as "friendly expressions of the American government toward the Chinese people."

Austin did not mention a word about the United States' funding of Japan's attack on China with large amounts of steel, gasoline, and other military materials, but described the Pearl Harbor incident, which broke out after the US government failed to seek compromise with Japan, as the United States suffering for China. He said: "The United States continued to express extremely serious concern about Japan's aggression against China," "which led to the Pearl Harbor incident."

Austin described the so-called Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, in which the United States further enslaved China after the war, as being "for the benefit of Chinese farmers." Austin went to great lengths to tout the "relief supplies" that supported the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and insulted the Chinese people by implying that they had to rely on American "relief" to survive. Austin said: "Millions upon millions of Chinese people will never forget that they were able to have food to eat, jobs, clothes to wear, and travel freely during the difficult years after the war, mostly because of American aid. The rice alone that we sent to China in 1948 and 1949 filled the rice bowls of ten million Chinese people."

Austin deliberately concealed the universally known fact here that millions upon millions of Chinese people will never forget that it was precisely the American "relief," American "material assistance," the "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce" signed by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and the United States' assistance to Chiang Kai-shek with 600 million US dollars in money and war materials to fight a large-scale counter-revolutionary civil war, that caused a large number of Chinese factories to close down, the vast countryside to go bankrupt, millions of people to have no food to eat, no jobs, no clothes to wear, and no freedom to travel, and millions of Chinese people to be slaughtered by American weapons in the counter-revolutionary civil war manufactured by the United States.

Austin painstakingly listed how many hospitals, schools, etc. the United States ran in China, in order to cover up the truth and mislead people into thinking that the United States "is not a bloody aggressor." Austin said: "American medical work, which began in 1835, has become an indispensable part of Chinese daily life today. American medical groups support 203 hospitals, 82 orphanages, and several other medical institutions such as midwifery schools. American donations have always been the main source of funding for the 320 orphanages run by the Catholic Church in China." "One-eighth of all Chinese university graduates have been educated in one or more of the thirteen universities established in China by the American Protestant missionary society. ... Some of those here have had the benefit of education in some of these schools. These schools include Yenching University; Cheeloo University. I want you to note how these schools are distributed across this beautiful land. Other schools are: West China Union University; Central China College; University of Nanking, Ginling College; Shanghai University; Soochow University; St. John's University; Fukien Christian University; Hwa Nan College; Lingnan University. In addition to these universities, there are the following well-known advanced vocational schools funded by the United States, such as: Peking Union Medical College; Hsiang-Ya Medical College; Fu Jen Catholic University of Peking; Tsinghua University; Nankai University." "At least 15,000 Chinese students have received university degrees in the various colleges and universities supported by the United States in China. Another 10,000 people have been educated at universities in the United States. ... In addition, it is estimated that more than 250,000 Chinese students have graduated from elementary and secondary schools funded by the United States in China."

Here, Austin dared to use the cultural aggression that the United States carried out by using imperialist privileges, weapons, and money to undermine China's sovereignty to bribe the hearts of patriotic Chinese people. But Austin wasted his efforts. Millions upon millions of patriotic Chinese people, including those who have been educated in the United States, know that American imperialists are using religious undertakings and their affiliated institutions to spread the poison of the so-called "American way of life" in China, attempting to cultivate a group of "talents" who are loyal to American imperialism. Austin did not dare to say that tens of thousands of patriotic Chinese Christians are carrying out a self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating movement against imperialist influence. He did not dare to say that the entire faculty and students of Fu Jen Catholic University, the most important Catholic university, had driven out the American aggressive forces and requested our Central People's Government to take it over, and that the faculty and students of other American church-run universities were also firmly standing at the forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. As for the Chinese intellectuals studying in the United States, people know that when these students expressed their patriotic will or even simply expressed their desire to return to China, the US government brutally persecuted them. This shows what kind of "friendship" the United States has for the Chinese people.

This spokesperson for US imperialism, who has shown so much "friendship" to the Chinese people, finally revealed his true colors as an aggressor. He openly expressed his intervention in the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan, and asked in a threatening tone: What "intentions does China have toward Taiwan"? Is China "willing to guarantee that it accepts a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue? Or will it take actions such as warfare to risk disrupting international peace and security?"

Dulles' speech to the UN General Assembly Political Committee on November 27th was the same as Austin's. Dulles also shamelessly described the US imperialist "aggression" against the Chinese people as "friendship." After nauseatingly talking about a section of imperialist missionaries who "every Christmas and Easter" were always "very happy to distribute small items of clothing to the Chinese people" as such "friendship," he turned the topic to the Taiwan issue, attempting to conceal the American aggression against Taiwan under the smoke screen of this "friendship."

Regarding the Taiwan issue itself, Dulles even tried to change the facts and reverse the US blockade of Taiwan. He cited the order given by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff to MacArthur on June 29th to prove this point, but it was precisely this order that clearly stated: "You are to defend Taiwan from aggression or attack by the Chinese Communists." Dulles then insidiously proposed that Taiwan "is a former Japanese colony in the process of secession." "As one of the major victorious nations in the war against Japan, the United States has a legitimate voice in 'determining the future status of Taiwan'." And according to Dulles, Truman's arrogant act of seizing China's territory of Taiwan should also be, according to Truman himself, an expression of "the United States having no territorial ambitions for the island."

Dulles tried to justify the US bombing of China's Northeast, but the result only confirmed this act of aggression by the United States and exposed how much the US government despised China's territorial sovereignty. Dulles said: "If such an infringement event had occurred, there would be no possible way for the United States to ascertain its cause." "It is obviously extremely difficult to ensure that every time a bomb falls on the Korean side of the bridge, and not on the Manchurian side." This means that since the United States invaded Korea, it could not help but "incidentally" invade China.

Like Austin, Dulles listed a series of aggressive acts by the United States since it advocated China's "Open Door" policy, calling them "friendly acts." Dulles expressed the hope that his so-called "friendship" could "play a decisive role" in "determining the relationship between the United States and China." He asked his "friends" in the United Nations not to be "deceived" by the accusations of China and the Soviet Union. But Dulles also seemed to know that the Chinese people would no longer be allowed to be fooled, so Dulles could not help but lament at the beginning of his speech: "What dominates my feelings is a feeling of sadness."

### 在安理会和联大政委会上  奥斯汀与杜勒斯发表无耻演说  为美帝侵略狡辩并恶意侮辱我国人民

    在安理会和联大政委会上
    奥斯汀与杜勒斯发表无耻演说
    为美帝侵略狡辩并恶意侮辱我国人民
    【新华社一日讯】在我国中央人民政府特派代表伍修权已行出席联合国大会政治委员会与安全理事会，并对美国侵略中国向全世界提出正义控诉的情形下，美国出席联大代表杜勒斯与驻安理会常任代表奥斯汀，先后在十一月二十七日联大政委会讨论苏联“控诉美国侵略中国”案的会议上，与十一月二十八日安理会讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾”案的会议上，发表长篇演说，妄图颠倒黑白，混淆是非，为美国帝国主义的侵略行为狡辩，并恶意侮辱中国人民。
    奥斯汀在十一月二十八日安理会的演说中，根本不敢正面答复中国的控诉，只能重复杜鲁门所谓派美国第七舰队防守台湾是为了免除“直接威胁太平洋地区的安全。”而在这样再次宣布了美国侵略台湾的野心以后，奥斯汀却转而以其冗长的篇幅，恬不知耻地重弹艾奇逊在“白皮书”内的旧调，高谈所谓“中美人民间友谊”，企图以此推卸罪责。奥斯汀说：“我的政府感到不快，我的政府鉴于中国人民与美国人民间有着长期的密切友谊，尤其不赞成这种攻讦。”
    但是奥斯汀对于中美人民友谊完全无知。他所一一列举的所谓“中美人民友谊”的“史实”，正是美国帝国主义一百年来侵略中国人民的血史，和对真正的中美人民友谊的诽谤。
    奥斯汀首先把一八四四年美国在中国取得了“治外法权”与“利益均沾”的帝国主义特权的“望厦条约”，称做“保持中国的领土与行政的完整”。接着奥斯汀把一八九○年美国企图与其他帝国主义国家瓜分中国的“门户开放”政策，一九○八年美国与日本就两国在华侵略利益成立谅解的罗脱——高平协定，一九一五年美国要求援用日本侵华“二十一条”中“最惠国”待遇的照会，一九一七年美国支持日本在华“特殊利益”并支持日本占领胶州湾的蓝辛—石井协定，都一律称之为“美国政府对中国人友好表现”。
    奥斯汀对于美国以大量钢铁汽油和其他军用物资资助日本进攻中国一事，一字不提，却把美国政府力求与日本妥协失败后爆发的珍珠港事件，说成是美国代中国受过。他说：“美国继续对日本侵略中国表示极严重的关怀”，“才招致了珍珠港事件”。
    奥斯汀把美帝在战后进一步奴役中国的所谓美中复兴农村联合计划，说成是“为了中国农民的利益”。奥斯汀竭力吹嘘支持国民党反动统治的“救济物资”，并侮辱中国人民必须仰赖美国“救济”为生。奥斯汀说：“千千万万的中国人决忘不了，在大战以后的困难岁月中，他们所以能有饭吃、有工作、有衣穿、能旅行，大部分是由于有了美国援助的缘故。仅仅我们在一九四八年和一九四九年送到中国的大米一宗便装满了一千万中国人的饭碗。”
    奥斯汀在这里故意隐瞒这个举世周知的事实，就是千千万万的中国人决忘不了，正是美国的“救济”，美国的“物资援助”，美国和蒋介石所订的“中美商约”，美国以六十万万美元的金钱和作战物资帮助蒋介石大打反革命的内战，使中国大批工厂倒闭，广大农村破产，成千万人没有饭吃、没有工作、没有衣穿、不能自由旅行，而且有几百万中国人在美国所制造的反革命内战中被美国武器所屠杀。
    奥斯汀不厌其烦地列举了美国在中国办了多少医院、学校等，以图掩饰事实的真相，使人误以为美国“并不是血腥侵略者”。奥斯汀说：“一八三五年开始的美国医药工作今天成了中国日常生活的不可缺少的一部分。美国的医药团体支持二百零三所医院、八十二所慈幼院及若干其他的医药机构如助产学校等。美国的捐助一直是天主教教堂在中国办的三百二十所孤儿院所需经费的主要来源。”“中国全部大学毕业生中有八分之一曾在美国基督教新教传教会建立的十三所大学中的一个大学或者一个以上的大学中受过教育。……在这里的一些人中就有若干人在某几个这些学校中曾得到教育的好处。这些学校包括燕京大学；齐鲁大学。我要你们注意，这些学校是如何分布在这个锦绣之邦。其他的学校是：华西大学；华中大学；金陵大学、金陵女子学院；沪江大学；之江大学；东吴大学；圣约翰大学；福建协和大学；华南女子学院；岭南大学。除这些大学之外，还有下列美国资助的有名的高级专科学校，如：北平协和医学院；湘雅医学院；北平辅仁大学；清华大学；南开大学。”“至少有一万五千名中国学生曾在美国在华所支持的各种院校中领受了大学学位。另有一万人在美国受过大学教育。……此外，据估计，有二十五万以上的中国学生曾在美国在华所资助的小学和中学毕业。”
    奥斯汀在这里胆敢把美国利用帝国主义特权、武器和金元而实施的破坏中国主权的文化侵略，用来贿买中国爱国人民的人心。但是奥斯汀枉费了心机。中国的千千万万的爱国人民，包括受过美国教育的人民在内，都知道美国帝国主义者是利用宗教事业及其附属机关在中国传播所谓“美国生活方式”的毒素，企图培植一批尽忠美国帝国主义的“人才”。奥斯汀不敢说出：成万的爱国的中国基督教徒正在进行反对帝国主义影响的自治自养自传运动。他不敢说出：最重要的天主教所办的辅仁大学的全体师生已经驱逐了美国侵略势力而请求我中央人民政府予以接收，其他的美国教会所办的大学的师生也坚决地站在抗美援朝运动的前线。至于在美国留学的中国知识分子，那么人们都知道，当这些留学生表现其爱国意志甚至仅仅表示回国的愿望时，美国政府便对他们横施迫害。由此可见，美国对于中国人民所抱的是一种什么样的“友谊”。
    对中国人民表现了这么多“友谊”的这个美国帝国主义代言人，最后仍然露出了侵略者的本相。他公然表示干涉中国人民解放自己领土台湾，他以威胁的口吻发问：中国“对台湾有什么意图呢”？中国“愿意保证自己接受台湾问题的和平解决办法呢？还是要采取作战一类的行动去冒扰乱国际和平安全的危险呢？”
    杜勒斯十一月二十七日在联大政委会上的演说与奥斯汀如出一辙。杜勒斯同样无耻地把美帝国主义对中国人民的“侵略”说成“友谊”。他令人作呕地谈了一段帝国主义分子的传教士“每逢圣诞节和复活节”总是“很满意能把小衣物散发给中国人民”这样的“友谊”以后，才把话题转到台湾问题，企图在这种“友谊”的烟幕下，掩饰美国对台湾的侵略。
    关于台湾问题本身，杜勒斯竟图偷天换日地改变美国封锁台湾的事实。他援引美国参谋长联席会议在六月二十九日给麦克阿瑟的命令来证明这一点，但是正是这个命令却明白写着：“你要保卫台湾使其不受中国共产党人的侵略或攻击”。杜勒斯接着阴险地提出：台湾“是在脱离过程中的一个前日本殖民地”。“身为对日战争中主要战胜国之一的美国，在‘决定台湾未来地位’方面有合法的发言权。”而据杜勒斯说，杜鲁门这种攫夺中国领土台湾的狂妄行为，还应该按照杜鲁门自己的说法，是“美国对该岛没有任何领土野心”的表示。
    杜勒斯力图为美机轰炸我国东北进行狡辩，而结果只是证实了美国这一侵略罪行，并暴露出美国政府是何等地蔑视我国领土主权。杜勒斯说：“如果这种侵犯事件发生过的话，美国也没有任何可能的方法来查明其原因。”“要每次都有把握不让一枚炸弹落在桥梁的满洲那边，而都落在朝鲜这边，显然是极端困难。”这就是说，美国既侵略朝鲜，就不能不“附带地”侵略中国。
    和奥斯汀一样，杜勒斯举出美国自主张中国“门户开放”以来的一连串侵略行为称做“友好行为”。杜勒斯表示希望他的所谓这种“友谊”，能在“决定中美两国间的关系上”，“起决定的作用”。他要求他在联合国内的“朋友们”不要被中国与苏联的控诉所“欺骗”。但是杜勒斯似乎也知道中国人民是再也不容许被人愚弄的，因此杜勒斯在其演说的开头就不能不苦恼地说：“支配着我的感情的是一种悲哀的感情。”
