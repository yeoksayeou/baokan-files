    New Knowledge Forum Sponsored by the China National Democratic Construction Association
    Holds 100th Anniversary Meeting
    Over the Past Year, the Association Has Made Certain Achievements in Promoting the Unity of Industrial and Commercial People and Raising Their Political Awareness
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) held a grand commemoration meeting for the 100th session of the New Knowledge Forum at the Xiehe Auditorium at 7:00 PM on December 16th. Xu Bing, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, was specially invited to give a political report. More than 300 people attended the meeting, including past speakers of the New Knowledge Forum, Huang Yanpei, convener of the CNDCA, Nan Hanchen, chairman of the Beijing Branch, and members of the association. The commemoration meeting was presided over by Nan Hanchen. Deputy Minister Xu Bing gave a brief report on the current military situation after the great victories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, and made an enlightening analysis and explanation of the future international situation and existing problems. He also encouraged the patriotic actions and demands for learning of industrialists and businessmen.
    Yao Boyan, the general director of the forum, pointed out in his report on the work of the forum from its establishment to the 100th session that: Because the content of the forum, whether it is political learning or business learning, is mainly aimed at promoting the progress of industrialists and businessmen and improving their political level. Therefore, it has achieved certain results in uniting the industrial and commercial circles and communicating the relationship between the industrial and commercial circles and the government. Of course, there are also some shortcomings in the specific work. First of all, the amount of business learning in the forum is heavier than political learning, which makes some members not understand the revolutionary theory enough. In addition, we cannot grasp the ideological situation of industrialists and businessmen more deeply, and therefore we cannot properly match it with political learning according to their needs, so as to improve everyone's learning mood. Based on these shortcomings, the following work plan is drawn up for the future:
    1. Strengthen political learning, grasp the problems that need to be solved in the industrial and commercial circles, and combine theory with practice.
    2. Increase opportunities for discussing problems and reflecting situations and opinions, so that industrialists and businessmen can know everything and say everything. Help the government understand the situation of the industrial and commercial circles through the New Knowledge Forum, and also help the industrial and commercial circles solve problems in a timely manner.
    3. Strengthen the cadre meeting and give more active play to the spirit of service. Strengthen the contact with the members to achieve the goal of uniting the industrial and commercial circles.
    In addition, Nan Hanchen specifically pointed out at the meeting that: The anti-American and aid-Korea demonstration parade of more than 50,000 people in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles on the "December 9th" Patriotic Festival is enough to show that Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have stood up. This unprecedented feat in history is enough to prove that their political consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved; and the New Knowledge Forum has made considerable contributions in this regard. After the meeting, the North China People's Revolutionary University Cultural and Art Troupe performed various wonderful cultural programs with the theme of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the meeting ended at 12:00.

    民建会主办新知识座谈会
    举行第一百次纪念会
    年余来该会在促进工商业者的团结与提高其政治觉悟上均有一定成绩
    【本报讯】民主建国会北京市分会主办的新知识座谈会第一百次纪念会于十二月十六日下午七时在协和礼堂隆重举行，特请中共中央统一战线工作部徐冰副部长作政治报告。出席新知识座谈会历次主讲人及民建总会召集人黄炎培、京分会主任委员南汉宸暨该会会友三百余人。纪念会由南汉宸主持。徐冰副部长就我人民志愿部队及朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线大捷后的当前军事情况做了简单扼要的报告，对今后国际形势和存在的问题，作了启发性的分析和阐释。并对工商业者的爱国行动和要求学习的表现加以鼓励。
    座谈会总干事姚博岩在报告该会从成立到第一百次会的工作时指出：由于座谈会的内容，无论是政治学习或业务学习，都是以促进工商业者的进步，提高其政治水平为主要目的。因此，在团结工商界和沟通工商界与政府的关系上，是有了一定成绩的。当然在具体工作上也存在着一些缺点。首先是座谈会中的业务学习的分量重于政治学习，致使一部分会友对于革命理论的了解不够。此外，不能更深入地掌握工商业者的思想情况，因之也就不能根据他们的需要与政治学习适当的配合起来，借以提高大家的学习情绪。根据这些缺点，拟出了今后的工作计划：
    一、加强政治学习，掌握工商界需要解决的问题，把理论与实际结合起来。
    二、增加讨论问题，反映情况、反映意见的机会，使工商业者知无不言，言无不尽。通过新知识座谈会来帮助政府了解工商界的情况，也帮助工商界及时地解决问题。
    三、加强干事会，更积极地发挥服务精神。加强与会友的联系，达到团结工商界的目的。
    另外，在会上南汉宸曾具体提出：“一二·九”爱国节日北京工商界五万余人的抗美援朝示威大游行，足够说明中国民族工商业者已经站起来了，这个历史上空前的壮举，就足以证明他们的政治觉悟已经空前的提高；而新知识座谈会在这方面是有着相当贡献的。会后由华北人民革命大学文工团演出各项以抗美援朝为内容的精彩文娱节目，十二时散会。
