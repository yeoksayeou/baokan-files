(Xinhua News Agency) Autumn planting and plowing (winter plowing) have been completed across the country. The national wheat planting area is similar to last year, with slight increases in a few regions. For example, in the North China region, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have trial-planted over 49 million mu of winter wheat this autumn. However, in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and other provinces, the area sown with wheat is less than last year due to farmers reserving land for cotton planting next spring, and due to drought followed by flooding. In the Northeast, 84,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) are sown with winter wheat. In the new areas of East China and Central South regions where land reform is being implemented this winter, thanks to the people's government's in-depth promotion of the policy of "whoever plants it harvests it, protect the fruits of labor," farmers' concerns about developing production have been eliminated. The sowing of crops such as wheat, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, alfalfa, and purple clover has been successfully completed, maintaining the autumn planting area of last year. This year, the entire Northwest region has sown over 33 million mu of winter wheat, an increase of over 2 million mu compared to last year. This year, the flooded fields in disaster areas have also been drained by farmers, and autumn planting has been completed in a timely manner. For example, in the Fuyang and Suxian special districts of northern Anhui, the wheat planting area reached 70% of the cultivated land area by the end of October.

Before autumn planting, local governments mobilized farmers to exchange seeds with each other, and issued seed grain loans and seed loans to help farmers solve the difficulty of obtaining wheat seeds. For example, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office loaned out 80 million jin of wheat seeds, accounting for approximately one-third of the total winter wheat actually sown in the region; the Henan Provincial People's Government loaned out 101 million jin of wheat seeds, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the province's wheat planting area. At the same time, local governments also led and helped farmers to promote improved wheat varieties and conduct seed soaking and seed mixing. In the North China region, Pingyuan and Shanxi provinces promoted 57 million jin of improved wheat varieties such as "438" and "Biyu Wheat." The East China region promoted 8 million jin of improved varieties, and the Southwest region also promoted 1.1 million jin. In Pingyuan Province, 50% of the wheat fields were sown after seed soaking and seed mixing. In Shanxi Province, 40% of the wheat field seeds were soaked, and more than half of the wheat field seeds were disinfected. Farmers in Laiyang, Jiaozhou, Yishui and other special districts in Shandong, in addition to exchanging disease-free wheat seeds with each other, also used clean manure (a kind of fertilizer without black smut bacteria) and isolated manure from seeds during sowing to prevent the occurrence of wheat black smut disease next year. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields in various places is generally more than last year. For example, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu in Shanxi Province increased by an average of 5 to 10 dan compared to last year. The quality of fertilizer applied in some areas of Hebei Province has also improved compared to last year.

Simultaneously with autumn planting, farmers across the country have been intensively engaged in the plowing of winter fallow land. Before autumn plowing (winter plowing), farmers in various places had a sense of complacency due to this year's bumper harvest, which seriously hindered the smooth progress of autumn plowing. In order to overcome the complacency of farmers, local governments sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to inspect and promote autumn plowing, and educated farmers with practical examples of increased production through autumn plowing. They also helped farmers overcome the difficulty of insufficient draft animals, thus promoting the widespread development of the autumn plowing (winter plowing) movement, laying a preliminary foundation for increasing grain and cotton production next year. In cotton-growing areas and old liberated areas with a better working foundation, the autumn plowing area this year has generally exceeded that of last year, and most of the plowing has been done early and deeply. Farmers in the Northeast, who have never had the habit of autumn plowing, are also enthusiastically carrying out autumn plowing under the advocacy of the people's government. 440,000 hectares of cotton and hemp land in Liaodong Province have been completely plowed, and Rehe, Lushun, and other places had plowed 30% of the total fallow land area as early as mid-October. The autumn plowing area in various parts of North China has generally maintained the level of last year. As of the end of October, ordinary old liberated areas in Hebei had plowed 70% of the fallow land, with some areas reaching 90%; Shanxi had plowed 60% to 80%; the land suitable for autumn plowing in the northern Chahar region had been completely plowed; the autumn plowing land in the northern Yanmen region reached 93%, exceeding the pre-war level. In East China and Central South regions, winter plowing of rice paddies has been successively completed; the winter plowing in the Southwest region began one month earlier than last year, and the plowed area exceeded that of last year.

    政府发放贷款推广优良品种            
    全国各地完成秋种秋耕 
    种麦面积与去年相近，少数地区略增
    【新华社讯】全国各地今年的秋种和秋耕（冬耕）工作都已完成。全国种麦面积与去年相近，少数地区略有增加。如华北区察哈尔、绥远两省今秋共试种冬麦达四千九百余万亩。河北、平原、山东等省则因农民留地明春种棉，和先旱后涝的原因，种麦比去年为少。东北种冬麦八万四千垧（每垧十五市亩）。华东和中南今冬实行土地改革的新区，由于人民政府深入宣传了“谁种谁收、保护劳动所得”的政策，消除了农民对发展生产的顾虑，顺利完成小麦、豌豆、蚕豆、油菜、苜蓿、紫云英等作物的播种任务，保持了去年的秋种面积。西北全区今年播种冬小麦达三千三百余万亩，比去年增加二百余万亩。今年灾区被淹田亩，经过农民排水，也及时完成了秋种工作。如皖北阜阳、宿县两专区至十月底，种麦面积即达到耕地面积的百分之七十。
    各地人民政府在秋种前，均发动农民互相调换种籽，并发放种籽贷粮和种籽贷款，以帮助农民解决麦种困难。如皖北行署曾贷出麦种八千万斤，约当该区冬麦实播总数的三分之一；河南省人民政府曾贷出麦种一亿零十万斤，约当该省种麦面积的四分之一。同时，各地人民政府又领导和帮助农民，推广优良麦种和进行浸种拌种。华北区平原和山西两省共推广了“四三八”和“碧玉麦”等优良麦种五千七百万斤，华东区推广了良种八百万斤，西南区也推广了一百一十万斤。平原省经过浸种拌种而下种的麦田达百分之五十。山西省百分之四十的麦田种籽都经过了浸种，半数以上的麦田种籽经过了消毒；山东莱阳、胶州、沂水等专区农民，除互相调换了无病麦种外，并在播种时用净粪（是一种没有黑穗病菌的肥料）和粪与种隔离等办法，以防止明年小麦黑穗病的发生。今年各地麦田施肥量一般也比去年增多。如山西全省每亩施肥量比去年平均增加五担到十担。河北省有些地区所施肥料的质量也较去年提高。
    与秋种同时，全国各地农民曾紧张地展开冬季休闲地的翻耕。在秋耕（冬耕）前，各地农民因今年丰收而存在着自满情绪，严重地阻碍着秋耕工作的顺利进行。各地人民政府为克服农民自满情绪，乃派遣大批干部深入农村检查和推动秋耕，并以秋耕增产的实际例子教育农民，并帮助农民克服了耕畜不足的困难，因而使秋耕（冬耕）运动普遍展开，为明年粮棉增产打下了初步的基础。在植棉区和工作基础较好的老区，今年秋耕面积一般都超过去年，并且大都做到早耕和深耕。东北农民向来没有秋耕的习惯，今年在人民政府的倡导下也热烈进行秋耕。辽东省四十四万垧棉麻地已全部耕完，热河、旅大等地远在十月中旬时即已耕完总休闲地面积的百分之三十。华北各地的秋耕面积一般也都维持了去年的水平。截至十月底止，河北一般老区即已耕完休闲地的百分之七十，部分地区达到百分之九十；山西耕完百分之六十到八十；察北地区适于秋耕的土地则已全部翻耕完毕；雁北地区秋耕地达百分之九十三，已超过战前的水平。华东和中南地区农民水稻田的冬耕已相继全部耕完；西南区今年冬耕较去年提早一个月开始，翻耕面积超过去年。
