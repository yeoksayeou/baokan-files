Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the International Democratic Women's Federation
Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Cai Chang

On December 1, 1945, at the First International Women's Congress held in Paris, the International Democratic Women's Federation, the most powerful and authoritative women's organization in the world, was born.

Since December 1, 1945, women from sixty countries around the world who love peace and democracy and oppose fascist wars have united around the International Democratic Women's Federation, marching towards the same goal, taking the same steps, and fighting strongly for the defense of world peace and the struggle for people's democracy, for the liberation of oppressed nations, and for the protection of the rights of women and children around the world, and moving towards victory.

Our All-China Democratic Women's Federation is proud to be a group member of the International Democratic Women's Federation; we believe that being able to contribute and exert the great strength of Chinese women under the leadership of this organization for the cause of world peace is our supreme and glorious responsibility.

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the International Democratic Women's Federation, we celebrate it with the most excitement and express our loyal and warm support for it.

This year, the International Democratic Women's Federation called on its member groups in various countries to turn December 1 this year into a day for women around the world to fight for peace. This call is very pertinent and timely for the current situation in our country.

The American imperialists, who are playing with fire, have already brought the flames of war to the doorstep of our country. Our compatriots in Northeast China on the Sino-Korean border, many of whom are women and children, are constantly being directly subjected to strafing and bombing by the US imperialist air force invading Korea. Facing the unreasonable and brutal acts of US imperialism in invading our neighbor Korea; occupying our territory of Taiwan; infringing on our airspace and territorial waters; and slaughtering our people, the whole country is boiling with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. In this movement, women across the country, like in the peace signature campaign, have shown a high degree of initiative and courage.

The famous model medical worker Li Lanting has bravely led a surgical team to the front lines. Following her, many such organized medical teams from all over the country have also set off.

Many famous female combat heroes, labor heroes, production models, work models, as well as the vast number of female workers, peasant women, female students, female employees, and many housewives, have protested against the aggressive behavior of US imperialism and are determined to transform anger into strength. Whether at the front or in the rear, in whatever position, they guarantee to complete and exceed their tasks to enhance the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. Some volunteered to participate in frontline work and go directly to the front to serve; others are stepping up their learning of first aid knowledge and skills in preparation for responding to the call of the motherland to go to the front at any time. Actions such as writing condolence letters and sending condolence bags are being widely carried out.

Our women's federations at all levels in the Northeast are very correct and necessary in quickly turning their work focus to this great movement and urgently mobilizing and organizing the strength of women in the Northeast to participate in defending the sacred border of the motherland, and to protect the safety of their families and children. The National Women's Federation fully agrees with this decision and calls on women's federations across the country to provide support in every possible way.

Chinese women love peace, but this is by no means a sign of fear of aggressors. The Chinese people and Chinese women, who have endured the hardships of war and have the struggle experience, will neither be afraid of the threats of the American imperialists nor be deceived by them. We have resolutely joined the oppressed people of all Asia and the peace-loving people of the world to fight for the defense of lasting peace and against wars of aggression. Our struggle is just, and is sympathized with and supported by hundreds of millions of people around the world, and we are bound to win the final victory.

Sisters across the country! Let us respond to the call of the International Democratic Women's Federation and take today—December 1—as our day to fight for peace, clearly recognize our current primary task, which is to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. All other work should be accelerated around this center.

Let us intensify the activities of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and use the achievements of our work as the most sublime salute to the fifth anniversary of the International Democratic Women's Federation!

    庆祝国际妇联五周年纪念
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席  蔡畅
    一九四五年十二月一日，在巴黎举行的第一届国际妇女代表大会上，诞生了全世界最有力量和最有权威的妇女组织——国际民主妇女联合会。
    自一九四五年十二月一日起，全世界六十个国家中爱好和平、民主，反对法西斯战争的妇女们，从此团结在国际妇联的周围，向着同一的目标，踏着同一的步伐，为保卫世界和平与争取人民民主，为争取被压迫民族的解放，为维护全世界妇女与儿童的权利，坚强地进行着斗争，并走向胜利。
    我们中华全国民主妇女联合会，以能作为国际妇联的一个团体会员而感到骄傲；我们认为能在这个组织的领导之下为着世界的和平事业，而供献及发挥中国妇女伟大的力量，是我们无上光荣的责任。
    值此国际妇联成立的五周年纪念，我们以最兴奋的心情来庆祝它，并表示我们对它的忠诚而热烈的拥护。
    今年，国际妇联号召它的各国会员团体，把今年十二月一日，变成全世界妇女为和平而斗争的日子。这个号召，对于我国目前形势来说，是非常中肯和切合时宜的。
    玩火的美帝国主义，已经把战火引到我国的大门口来了，中、朝边境上的我东北同胞，其中不少是妇女和儿童，不断地在直接遭受美帝侵朝空军的扫射，轰炸。面对着美帝国主义侵略我邻邦朝鲜；侵占我国领土台湾，侵犯我国的领空、领海，屠杀我国人民的无理和残暴行为，全国正沸腾着抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。全国妇女们在这个运动中，也像在和平签名运动中一样，表现了高度的积极和英勇。
    著名的模范医务工作者李蓝丁，已带领一个手术队英勇地上了前线。全国各地继她之后，不少的这样组织起来的医务工作队也出发了。
    许多全国著名的女战斗英雄、劳动英雄、生产模范、工作模范以及广大的女工们、农妇们、女学生、女职员和许多家庭主妇，都纷纷抗议美帝国主义的侵略行为，并决心化愤怒为力量，不论在前方，在后方，不论在那种岗位上，都保证完成并超过自己的任务来增强抗美援朝、保家卫国的力量。有的志愿参加战地工作，直接去前方服务；有的加紧学习救护知识和技术，以备随时响应祖国的号召上前方。而写慰问信，寄慰问袋等行动，更是正在广泛地开展着。
    我们的东北各级妇联，能迅速地将自己的工作中心，转向这个大运动，紧急地动员、组织东北地区妇女的力量，来参加保卫神圣的祖国边疆，来保卫自己的家庭和孩子们的安全，是非常正确和必要的。全国妇联完全同意这个决定，并号召全国各地妇联用一切方法来进行支援。
    中国的妇女们是爱好和平的，但这决不是害怕侵略者的表现。饱经战争艰苦和有着斗争锻炼与经验的中国人民、中国妇女，是既不会害怕美帝国主义者的威胁，也不会受它的欺骗的。我们已坚决地和全亚洲被压迫的人民，和全世界爱好和平的人们并肩为保卫持久和平、反对侵略战争而战斗。我们的斗争是正义的，是全世界亿万人民所同情和支持的，我们是必然会得到最后胜利的。
    全国的姊妹们！让我们响应国际妇联的号召，把今天——十二月一日作为我们为和平而斗争的日子，明确地认识我们当前的首要任务，是抗美援朝保家卫国，一切其他工作，均应围绕这个中心来加速进行。
    让我们加紧抗美援朝的活动，用我们工作的成就，来作为对国际妇联五周年纪念的最崇高的敬礼！
