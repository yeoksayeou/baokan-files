    Regarding the International Peace Prize
    (Question) The International Peace Prize Jury Committee, established by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, announced on November 22nd that the 1950 Peace Prize and Peace Medal would be awarded to several writers and artists, such as the Czechoslovak writer Julius Fučík, etc. Could you briefly introduce the biographies of these winners?
    He Yuzi
    (Answer) A total of nineteen writers and artists, and one magazine, were awarded the Peace Prize and Peace Medal by the International Peace Prize Jury Committee of the Standing Committee. Based on our current information, we will introduce the brief biographies of seven people, including Fučík, as follows:

    Czech People's Writer and Martyr Julius Fučík
    Fučík was awarded a special honorary Peace Prize for his posthumous work, "Report from the Gallows" (translated into Chinese by Liu Liao Yi, published by New China Bookstore). He died in a Nazi prison in 1943. This book was written by him in prison.

    Fučík was born in 1902 in Pilsen, a city famous for beer production in the Czech Republic. He was the son of a working-class family, a Communist Party member, and worked as a newspaper editor, writing political commentaries, reportage, short stories, etc. before his death.

    On March 15, 1939, when Fascist Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, he appeared in disguise as a "professor," secretly leading the underground newspaper "Red Power News" of the Czech Communist Party, using this weapon to carry out the anti-fascist struggle. On April 24, 1942, he unfortunately fell into the hands of Nazi secret agents and was sent by cruel bandits to a prison in Pankrác near Prague. He was murdered in June of the following year. The posthumous work in prison was compiled and published by Fučík's wife.

    Chilean Poet Neruda
    The poet Pablo Neruda, who won the International Peace Literature Prize for his poem "Let the Woodcutter Wake Up" (translated into Chinese by Yuan Shuipai, published by New Crowd Publishing House), is Chilean. He was born in 1904 in Temuco City (a city in central Chile). He began to enter the poetry world at the age of seventeen with a small collection of poems. In his youth, he was deeply influenced by Mayakovsky.

    In 1936, he served as the Chilean consul in Madrid. He stood with the Spanish people and opposed Franco with action.

    Later, he was elected as a senator for a time. He was accused of "treason" for publishing an open letter exposing the conspiracy of the Chilean dictator Videla. He was forced into exile and successively wrote long poems such as "Chronicle of 1948" and "Let the Woodcutter Wake Up." On April 25, 1949, Neruda attended the Peace Congress in Paris and recited a new poem on stage, deeply moving the audience.

    Turkish Democratic Poet Hikmet
    The Turkish democratic poet Nâzım Hikmet, who won this International Peace Literature Prize, was born in 1902. His life was inseparable from the anti-fascist revolutionary struggle.

    The real turning point in Hikmet's life was when he accepted Marxism as his philosophy of life. He went to the Soviet Union and studied literature, sociology, and political economy in Moscow. He met Mayakovsky, and Mayakovsky's poems greatly influenced him.

    In 1925, he managed to return to Turkey and was arrested by the police. Since then, he has been trapped in a series of interrogations and imprisonments.

    In 1938, he was sentenced by the Secret Military Tribunal of the Army and Navy to twenty-eight years and four months of solitary confinement. In prison, this great anti-fascist fighter, even suffering inhuman prison life, still wrote poetry under various pen names. (Translations of his poems can be found in literary magazines such as "People's Literature.")

    This year, the poet is sick in prison and his life is in danger. His request to be released from prison for medical treatment was also rejected by the Turkish government. Therefore, progressive people all over the world have risen up to demand the release of this patriotic poet from prison. According to the Soviet Literary Gazette on July 19 this year, Hikmet has been released. As the newspaper pointed out, this is another victory for the camp of peace and democracy over the camp of imperialism.

    French Art Master Picasso
    Picasso, the winner of the Peace Art Prize, was born in Spain in 1881. He moved to Paris in 1904. He engaged in painting under the guidance of his father since childhood, and entered art school at the age of fourteen. Since then, he has continued to create tirelessly, making him a world-renowned art master.

    During the Spanish Civil War, Picasso served as the honorary president of the Prado Art Museum; he participated in the struggle with paintings and words, and sold his works to raise funds for the Republic.

    After the fall of France in 1940, Picasso still lived in Paris. His artistic status and reputation allowed him to avoid open persecution under Nazi rule.

    The spirit of the French Communist Party in waging an unyielding underground struggle against the Nazis during the fall of France deeply moved Picasso, further changing his thinking. After the liberation of France in 1944, Picasso announced his participation in the French Communist Party.

    Last April, Picasso dedicated a painting to the First World Peace Congress, using a tranquil and pure white dove to express the simple dignity of hundreds of millions of people and their desire to strive for peace. This year, he painted another dove spreading its wings and soaring high (see the first page of the People's Daily on November 17) dedicated to the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw. It symbolizes that peace is advancing, that peaceful humanity has made progress and victory, and future victories. Picasso's work that won the 1950 International Peace Prize is his first peace dove.

    American Black King of Song Robeson
    The American black king of song Robeson, who won the International Peace Art Prize for "Song of Peace," is not only a people's singer, but also a singer dedicated to the cause of peace and loved by people all over the world. He was warmly welcomed by audiences when he sang in the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and other countries. His singing is full of the strong will to struggle.

    Because Robeson is black, he is subjected to various unreasonable oppression and discrimination in the United States. In today's fascistized United States, he has become one of the targets of persecution by reactionaries.

    For many years, Robeson has combined his artistic activities with many progressive movements in the United States. He is now one of the chairmen of the National Committee of the Progressive Party, and is also a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

    Polish Female Filmmaker Jakubowska
    The Polish female filmmaker Jakubowska, who won the International Peace Film Prize for the film "The Last Stage," began her film career in 1929, collaborating with the advanced Polish filmmaker Alexander Ford. She made her first film, "On the Banks of the Niemen River," before the war, but the film was destroyed when the war broke out and has never been screened.

    During the war, Jakubowska was imprisoned in the largest Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz, Poland. This was a "death factory" where the German Kou used gas to kill people, killing 4 million people. However, the terror in this concentration camp did not intimidate the filmmaker. At that time, she had the determination to expose this barbaric crime with film.

    After the liberation of Poland, the democratic society gave Jakubowska the opportunity to develop her artistic talent and realized her hope of filming the truth of the largest Nazi concentration camp. "The Last Stage" is her great achievement. It is a powerful warning that requires people to stop the resurrection of fascist terror.

    Czech Musician Dobiáš
    Václav Dobiáš, who won the gold medal for musical works in the International Peace Prize, is one of the most gifted composers in the Czech Republic. He was born into a working-class family in 1909. His father was a keen musician. Dobiáš's first important musical work was his opera-style song entitled "Stalin's Order to Liberate Prague." This song and other works by Dobiáš are about to be performed in the Soviet Union. In 1950, he began to write his "Czechoslovak Dance," part of which he composed into the opera-style song "Build Your Country, You Strengthen Peace." This song was submitted by the Czech Composers Union for the International Peace Prize selection and won the gold medal.

    关于国际和平奖金
    （问）世界保卫和平大会常设委员会所设立的国际和平奖金评议委员会于十一月二十二日公布，一九五○年和平奖金与和平奖章奖给若干文学家与艺术家，如捷克斯洛伐克作家尤利斯·伏契克等。可否请简单介绍这些获奖人的略历？
    何育滋
    （答）这次和大常设委会国际和平奖金评议委员会评定获得和平奖金与和平奖章的文学家与艺术家一共有十九人与一本杂志。现在根据我们现有的资料，将伏契克等七人略历介绍如下：
    捷克人民作家和烈士尤利斯·伏契克
    伏契克以他的遗作《绞索勒着脖子时的报告》（有刘辽逸的中译本、新中国书局出版）获得特别荣誉和平奖金。他已于一九四三年在纳粹狱中遇难，这书是他在狱中所写成的。
    伏契克于一九○二年生于捷克产啤酒著名的皮尔森城，他是一个工人家庭的儿子，共产党员，生前做过报纸编辑，写过政论、报告文学、短篇小说等。
    一九三九年三月十五日法西斯德国占领捷克，他以伪装“教授”的超然姿态出现，暗中领导捷共的地下报纸“红色权力报”，以这武器来进行反法西斯的斗争。一九四二年四月二十四日，不幸落入纳粹特务之手，被残酷的匪徒送入布拉格附近的譒克拉斯地方的一个监狱里。第二年六月间被害。狱中遗作系由伏契克之妻整理后发表。
    智利诗人尼鲁达
    以《让那伐木者醒来》（有袁水拍的中译本、新群出版社出版）一诗而荣鹰国际和平文学奖金的诗人巴勃罗·尼鲁达是智利人。一九○四年生于得墨哥城（智利中部一城市）。他在十七岁时就以写成一本小诗集而开始走进诗坛，年青时他受玛雅珂夫斯基的影响颇深。
    一九三六年时他担任着智利驻马德里领事，他和西班牙人民站在一起，曾以行动反对佛朗哥。
    后来他一度当选参议员，因发表公开信，揭露智利独裁者维代拉阴谋，被控以“叛国罪”。以后他被迫流亡，先后写成《一九四八年纪事》《让那伐木者醒来》等长诗。一九四九年四月二十五日尼鲁达出席巴黎的保卫和平大会，曾登台朗诵他的一首新诗，听众深受激动。
    土耳其民主诗人希克梅特
    荣获此次国际和平文学奖金的土耳其民主诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特生于一九○二年，他的一生是和反法西斯的革命斗争分不开的。
    希克梅特一生真正的转折点是在他接受了马克思主义作为他的人生哲学的时候。他到过苏联，在莫斯科研究文学、社会学和政治经济学。他见到了玛雅柯夫斯基，玛雅柯夫斯基的诗给了他很大的影响。
    一九二五年他设法回到了土耳其，被警察抓住了。从此以后就陷在一连串的审讯和监禁里。
    一九三八年，他被海陆军秘密军事法庭判处二十八年零四个月的单独监禁的徒刑。在狱里，这个伟大的反法西斯战士纵使遭受非人的监狱生活，仍以各种笔名写诗。（他的诗的译文散见《人民文学》等文艺杂志）
    今年诗人病在狱中，生命垂危，他提出要求出狱治病的要求，也被土耳其政府拒绝。于是全世界的进步人士纷纷起来要求释放这位爱国诗人出狱。据今年七月十九日苏联文学报载，希克梅特已获释。正像该报所指出的，这是和平与民主阵营对帝国主义阵营获得了又一次的胜利。
    法国艺术大师毕加索
    和平艺术奖金的得奖人毕加索一八八一年生于西班牙。一九○四年移居巴黎。他从小就在他父亲的启导下从事绘画，十四岁进艺术学校。此后继续不懈的创作，使他成为举世知名的艺术大师。
    在西班牙内战中，毕加索担任布勒多艺术院的荣誉院长；他用绘画和文字参加斗争，并出售自己的作品为共和国募集款项。
    一九四○年法国沦陷后，毕加索仍住在巴黎。他以他的艺术地位和声誉得以免于纳粹统治下的公然迫害。
    法国共产党在法国沦陷期间与纳粹作不屈不挠的地下斗争的精神，深深感动了毕加索，使他的思想进一步变化。一九四四年法国解放后，毕加索宣布参加法国共产党。
    去年四月，毕加索献给第一届世界和大一幅画，用一只恬静洁白的鸽子表示出亿万人民纯朴的尊严，和他们争取和平的愿望。今年他又画了一只正在展翅高翔的鸽子（见人民日报十一月十七日第一版）献给在华沙召开的第二届世界和大，它象征和平正在前进，和平人类已经获得进展和胜利以及未来的胜利。毕加索获得一九五○年度国际和平奖金的作品就是他第一幅和平鸽。
    美国黑人歌王罗伯逊
    以《和平之歌》而荣获国际和平艺术奖金的美国黑人歌王罗伯逊，不但是一位人民歌手，而且是献身于和平事业为全世界人民敬爱的歌手。他在苏联、法国、捷克、瑞典等国演唱时，都受到听众热烈欢迎。他的歌声里充满斗争的坚强意志。
    罗伯逊因身为黑人，在美国受到各种无理的压迫和歧视。在今天法西斯化的美国，他更成了反动分子迫害的对象之一。
    好多年来，罗伯逊一直把自己的艺术活动与美国的许多进步运动结合起来。现在他是进步党的全国委员会主席之一，同时是世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的委员。
    波兰女制片家雅库波夫斯卡
    以《最后阶段》一片获得国际和平电影奖金的波兰女制片人雅库波夫斯卡，曾在一九二九年开始她的电影生涯，与先进的波兰电影工作者亚历山大·福特合作。她在战前曾摄成第一部影片《聂曼河畔》，但大战爆发这片子就被销毁，一直没有放映过。
    大战期间，雅库波夫斯卡被囚于波兰奥斯威辛地方最大的纳粹集中营，这里是德寇用煤气杀人的“死亡工厂”，曾先后杀害四百万人之多。但是这集中营内的恐怖并没有怔住这位电影工作者。她当时就有了把这种野蛮罪行用电影揭露的决心。
    波兰解放之后，民主的社会使雅库波夫斯卡获得了发扬艺术天才的机会，并使她实现了摄制纳粹最大集中营真相的影片的希望。《最后阶段》一片就是她的伟大成就，它是一个要求人们阻止法西斯恐怖的复活的强有力的警告。
    捷克音乐家多比亚斯
    获得国际和平奖金中音乐作品的金质奖章的伐克拉夫·多比亚斯是捷克最富于天赋的作曲家之一。他在一九○九年生于一个工人之家。他父亲是个热心的音乐家。多比亚斯第一件重要的音乐作品是他那篇《斯大林解放布拉格的命令》为题的戏曲体歌曲。这歌曲与其他多比亚斯的作品即将在苏联演奏。一九五○年他着手写他的《捷克斯洛伐克舞曲》，其中一部分又经他组成《建设你的国家，你就加强了和平》的戏曲体歌曲，这歌曲也就是捷克作曲家联盟提供国际和平奖金评选，并获得金质奖章的作品。
