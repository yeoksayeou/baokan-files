The representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China were finally invited to participate in the discussion of the Soviet Union's accusation against the United States for aggression against China, despite the stubborn opposition of the United States and those countries that constitute the so-called "American majority" in the United Nations.

Therefore, the very arrival of the delegation of the People's Republic of China at Lake Success a few days ago marks the failure of the American policy of aggression. This important fact points out, with new force, all the illegality, foolishness, and aggressiveness of the policy that the United States stubbornly follows towards the new China.

The entire process of the Fifth UN General Assembly demonstrates that the American ruling groups and the American representatives in the United Nations not only disagree with formally recognizing the People's Republic of China, but also try their best to prevent other countries subordinate to the "Dollar Empire" from recognizing the People's Republic of China.

Starting from the fact of not recognizing and openly opposing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the American imperialists are undermining the entire foundation of international cooperation and international law, attempting to prevent the People's Republic of China from participating in the United Nations, and resolutely shutting the door of international institutions in the face of the great and heroic Chinese people.

The arrogant American militarists even try to "support" the aggressive position of American diplomacy with continuous provocative actions and the bombing of Chinese territory and peaceful residents, constantly attempting to worsen relations between the two countries.

The American warmongers are carrying out a policy of armed aggression against the People's Republic of China, while entrusting their diplomats to use a pile of arguments suitable for "jurisprudence" to cover up their criminal behavior.

However, if, according to the ancient Romans, one calmly and impartially studies this most perplexing "argument" from the perspective of similar precedents established and supported by Americans throughout the ages, one can see that this argument cannot withstand any criticism at all.

The recognition of the legitimacy of the People's Republic of China is even directly in line with the regulations concluded between the American countries and the current International Convention on "The Rights and Duties of States" of December 26, 1933, which states: "As a subject of international law, a state should possess the following qualifications: 1. A permanent population; 2. A defined territory; 3. A government; 4. Capacity to enter into relations with other states."

The fact that the People's Republic of China now possesses these qualifications is not difficult to understand. She has even established formal diplomatic relations with seventeen countries in the world, including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, Burma, India, Vietnam, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and Indonesia. In addition, eight countries, including Pakistan, Norway, Israel, Afghanistan, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ceylon, have also formally recognized the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, although these countries have not yet exchanged diplomatic representatives with her.

The People's Republic of China has signed trade agreements, treaties, and contracts with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and is now conducting trade negotiations with the Hungarian People's Republic. In addition, China has also developed trade relations with many capitalist countries.

American diplomats believe that China cannot be allowed to participate in the United Nations because she "changed the form of its government by revolutionary methods." They consciously forget that the political system of this or that country is an internal matter for the people who live there; and forget that other countries should not and cannot have the right to interfere in the internal affairs of that country.

As stated in the United Nations Charter, "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."

It is useful to remind the commanders of American foreign policy, such as Dulles and Acheson - those who frequently swear before Jefferson and other American celebrities whom they consider to have permanent prestige - that their current policy towards China is clearly the exact opposite from the viewpoint of that Jefferson, as well as from the viewpoint of Monroe, Adams, and Buchanan.

On November 7, 1792, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson said in a directive to U.S. Minister to Paris, Morrison, regarding the recognition of the French Republic: "The recognition of any legitimate government which is truly declared by the will of the nation is in accordance with our principles."

In 1793, when a new change occurred in the French political system and the possibility of recognizing the French government arose, Jefferson directly pointed out: "It is absolutely impossible for us to deny any nation the right to establish its own government like us—according to this right, every nation can govern itself in any appropriate form it loves, and can change this form according to its own will."

The leaders of today's imperialist America who are delaying allowing the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations should also recall the directive of U.S. Secretary of State Buchanan to U.S. Minister to Paris, Raga, on March 31, 1848, which stated: "We recognize that all nations have the right to create and reform their political systems according to their own will and wishes."

Now American diplomats may argue. They say that the standards and principles of Jefferson and other American celebrities are not binding on them, because these standards only apply to bourgeois countries, and the country now being talked about is ruled by a political system that is fundamentally different from the American political system.

However, these "refutations" of American diplomats are completely incorrect. Establishing diplomatic relations with a certain country does not at all mean that one must approve of the system established in that country, as envisioned by the hired servants of American monopoly capital, and it certainly does not have such a meaning. Establishing normal diplomatic relations is only a necessary method of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and supporting international cooperation.

Let's just give one example here. In 1948, the Ninth Pan-American Conference was held in Bogotá (formally to consolidate international cooperation, but in reality to further subordinate Latin America to American imperialism). The declaration issued by the conference mentioned the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with new governments: "Establishing or maintaining diplomatic relations with a government does not indicate an opinion on the internal politics of that government."

From the irrefutable facts mentioned above, it can be concluded that American diplomacy, and the "American majority" in the United Nations that follows American diplomacy, in their attitude towards the People's China, do not follow the standards of international law that were previously recognized by the United States and are known throughout the world, but only follow Wall Street's policies of non-recognition, blockade, delay, and isolation, etc. This policy is caused by class hatred and is needed for the benefit of American tycoons.

This policy of aggression, as Vyshinsky said in his speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27, "The only explanation is that the American ruling groups, despite the failure of their policy in China, do not abandon the policy of re-establishing their rule in China. Therefore, the United States exposes itself as the irreconcilable enemy of democratic China."

At the same time, the United States continues to formally support the Kuomintang swindlers, even though they cannot represent the Chinese people, but only represent a small group of corrupt adventurers who have been thrown into the dustbin of history by the great hand of the Chinese people. Despite the fact that, according to the standards of international law that the United States also recognizes, this reactionary Kuomintang group has lost actual political power, it should inevitably lead to the termination of diplomatic recognition and diplomatic relations.

The United States always tries to "explain" its attitude towards the issue of allowing People's China to join the United Nations by not recognizing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. However, this argument has no basis at all.

The issue of recognizing the People's Republic of China by the United States and other countries has no connection whatsoever with the issue of allowing the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations.

International reality proves that the participation of this or that country in international conferences and international organizations should not and cannot be based on other countries' formal recognition or non-recognition of it under any circumstances. The maintenance of international political and economic ties often urgently requires allowing a government to participate in international institutions to solve pressing matters, even though this government is not formally recognized by all participants of this international institution. Let us give another precedent recognized by the United States. In 1926, the United States did not object to Nicaragua and Ecuador participating in the Pan-American Conference commemorating Bolívar, even though the two governments were not recognized by the United States at that time. The head of the American delegation once gave the following instruction on this matter: "Congress agrees with your view that the participation of representatives from Nicaragua and Ecuador in the conference is tantamount to recognizing the existing systems in the two countries."

As is well known, such a principle is still observed in the Pan-American Union, in which the United States, to put it mildly, is in a leading position. According to Article 49 of the U.S. Constitution, formally recognizing this or that government is not a necessary condition for that government to participate in the leadership meetings of the Pan-American Union.

Therefore, the United States' attempt to "create" an excuse for not allowing the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations on the grounds that the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China has not yet been recognized by Washington is absolutely unfounded, even from the perspective of the methods and rules adopted in other events presided over by the U.S. State Department itself.

This policy is doomed to complete failure. Because in the future, any issue related to the Far East cannot be genuinely resolved without the attitude and viewpoint of the People's Republic of China. This is why Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, stated completely correctly: "Anyone who attempts to exclude nearly 500 million people of China from the United Nations, anyone who attempts to obliterate and undermine the interests of this quarter of humanity and presumptuously solve any Eastern problem directly related to China, will surely be bruised and battered!"

### 国际公法的破坏者们——论美国对中华人民共和国的冒险政策

    国际公法的破坏者们
    ——论美国对中华人民共和国的冒险政策
    苏联法学士  拉扎列夫
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表不顾联合国内美国以及那些构成了所谓“美国多数”的国家的顽强的反对，终于被邀请参加讨论苏联所提出的关于美国侵略中国的控诉案了。
    因此前几天中华人民共和国代表团抵达成功湖这件事本身就标志着美国侵略政策的失败。这个重要的事实以一种新力量把美国极端顽固地所遵循的对新中国政策的全部非法性、愚蠢性和侵略性指出了。
    第五届联合国大会的全部讨论过程，说明了美国统治集团和美国在联合国的代表们，不仅不同意正式承认中华人民共和国，而且还尽力阻挠从属于“美元帝国”的其他国家对中华人民共和国的承认。
    从不承认并公开地敌对中华人民共和国中央人民政府这一事实出发，美国帝国主义者们破坏了国际合作和国际公法的全部基础，试图不许中华人民共和国参加联合国，并在伟大英勇的中国人民面前断然关住国际机构的大门。
    美国跋扈的军人们甚至还以连续的挑衅行动和对中国领土及和平居民的轰炸，尽力“支持”美国外交的侵略地位，不断地企图恶化两国间的关系。
    美国的战争贩子们进行着武装侵略中华人民共和国的政策，同时委托自己的外交家利用一堆适合于“法学”的论证，来掩饰自己的犯罪行为。
    但是，如果按照古罗马人的说法，从历代以来美国人所建立所赞助的类似先例的观点，冷静而无偏爱地把这个最令人疑惑的“论据”，研究一番，就可以看出，这个论据是完全经不住任何批判的。
    承认中华人民共和国的合法性甚至对于美洲各国之间所缔结的法规和现行的一九三三年十二月二十六日关于“国家的权利和义务”的国际公约也是直接相符合的，公约中说：“作为国际公法主体的国家，应当具备下列的资格：１，有固定的人民，２，有一定的国土，３，有政府，４，有能力与其他国家建立关系。”
    中华人民共和国现在具备这些资格的事实是不难理解的。她甚至已与世界上十七个国家建立了正式的外交关系，这些国家包括着苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、缅甸、印度、越南、丹麦、瑞典、瑞士、印度尼西亚。此外还有巴基斯坦、挪威、以色列、阿富汗、芬兰、荷兰、英国、锡兰等八个国家也都正式承认了中华人民共和国中央人民政府，虽然这些国家现在还没有与她互换外交代表。
    中华人民共和国与苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国签订了贸易协定、条约和合同，现在又正与匈牙利人民共和国进行着贸易谈判。此外，中国与许多资本主义国家也展开了贸易关系。
    美国外交家们认为：不能容许中国参加联合国，因为她“以革命方法改变了本身的管理形式”。他们有意识地忘记了：这个或那个国家的政体是居住其中的人民的内部事情；又忘记了：其他国家不应当而且不可能有权干涉该国的内部事情。
    正如联合国宪章中所说，“不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家内管辖之事件”。
    向美国对外政策的指挥者们如杜勒斯和艾奇逊之流——这些人是在他们认为有永久声望的哲斐逊及美国其他名人面前经常宣誓的——这样的提醒一下，是有益的：现在他们对中国的政策，从那位哲斐逊的观点，以及从门罗、亚当斯和布卡南的观点来看，都明显地恰正相反。
    一七九二年十一月七日，美国国务卿托玛斯·哲斐逊致美国驻巴黎公使莫里逊的关于承认法兰西共和国的指令中说：“对真正为民族意志所宣布的任何合法的政府的承认适合于我们的原则”。
    一七九三年，当法兰西政治制度发生了新变化，承认法兰西政府可能性发生了问题的时候，哲斐逊直截了当地指出：“我们绝对不可能拒绝任何民族享有像我们一样的奠定自己的政府的权利——依据这种权利，每个民族都可以在自己所爱好的任何适当形式下管理自己，而且可以按照自己的意志改变这种形式”。
    对容许中华人民共和国参加联合国一事予以拖延的今日帝国主义美国的领导者们，又应当把一八四八年三月三十一日美国国务卿布卡南致美国驻巴黎公使拉甲的指令回忆一下，该指令中说：“我们承认一切民族有权利按照自己的意志和愿望来创造并改建自己的政体。”
    现在美国外交家们也许会辩白的罢。他们说，哲斐逊和其他美国名人的标准和原则对于他们是没有拘束力的，因为这些标准只适用于资产阶级国家，而现在所谈到的国家，却是根本上异于美国政治制度的政体所统治的。
    但是，美国外交家们的这些“辩驳”隙全不正确。与某一个国家建立外交关系，这完全不应当照美国独占资本的雇佣奴仆们所设想那样，意味着一定要赞成该国所建立的制度，而且决没有这样的意味，建立正常外交关系只是一种不干涉他国内政并支持国际合作的必要方法罢了。
    我们在这里仅仅举一个例罢。一九四八年，在波哥大召开了第九届泛美会议（形式上是为了巩固国际合作，实际上是为了使拉丁美洲进一步附属于美国帝国主义。会议所发表的宣言中提到与新政府建立外交关系的问题：“与一个政府建立或维持外交关系，这并不表示对该政府的内部政治的意见”。
    从无可反驳的上述事实，可以断定，美国外交，和追随着美国外交的联合国中的“美国多数”，在对人民中国的态度上，没有遵循从前美国所承认而且举世周知的国际公法的标准，单只遵循着华尔街的关于不承认、封锁、延宕和孤立等等的政策，这政策是阶级仇恨所引起并为美国豪富利益所需要的。
    这个侵略政策，正如十一月二十七日维辛斯基在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说中所说，“唯一的解释就是，美国统治集团不顾自己在中国的政策的失败，不抛弃重新在中国建立自己统治的政策。因此，美国暴露了自己为民主中国的不共戴天的仇人。”
    同时美国继续正式支持着国民党骗子们，尽管他们不能代表中国人民，单只代表一小撮腐朽的冒险家集团，这集团是已经被伟大中国人民的巨掌抛弃到历史垃圾堆里了。尽管依照美国也承认了的国际公法的标准，这个反动的国民党集团，丧失了实际的政权，也就无可避免地应该引起外交承认和外交关系的终止。
    美国老是企图以不承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府这一点来“说明”她对容许人民中国加入联合国问题的态度。但是，这个论据是没有任何基础的。
    从美国和其他国家方面来承认中华人民共和国的问题与容许中华人民共和国加入联合国问题，无论如何是没有任何关系的。
    国际的真实情况证明：这个或那个国家无论在何种情况下参加国际会议和国际组织，总是不应当而且不可能依据于其他国家对它的正式承认或不承认的。国际政治上和经济上的联系的维持往往迫切地要求着容许一个政府参加国际机构来解决刻不容缓的事，尽管这个政府并非为这个国际机构所有参加者所正式承认。我们再举出一个美国所承认的先例。一九二六年，美国没有反对尼加拉瓜和厄瓜多尔参加纪念波里瓦尔的泛美会议，尽管这两个政府当时没有被美国所承认。美国代表团团长曾对这件事作如下的训示：“国会同意你们的这个观点：尼加拉瓜和厄瓜多尔的代表参加会议这一件事，就是承认该两国的现存制度”。
    如所周知，现在这样的原则在泛美联盟中仍然遵守着，在这个联盟里，美国，说得温和些，是在领导地位。根据美国宪法第四十九条，正式承认这个或那个政府，并不是该政府参加泛美联盟领导会议的必要条件。
    因此，美国企图以中华人民共和国的合法政府迄今没有被华盛顿承认的情况，“造成”不容许中华人民共和国加入联合国的借口，这种借口甚至从美国国务院自己主持下的其他事件上所采取的方法与规则的观点，也是绝对没有根据的。
    这种政策是注定要完全失败的。因为今后任何一个有关远东的问题，如果没有中华人民共和国的态度和观点，则决不能获得真正的解决。这就是为什么中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来完全正确地声明道：“谁要是企图把中国近五万万人口排除在联合国之外，谁要是抹煞和破坏这四分之一人类的利益而妄想独断地解决与中国有直接关系的任何东方问题，那么，谁就一定要碰得头破血流！”
