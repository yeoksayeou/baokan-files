    Popularizing and Deepening Ideological Education on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Home, and Defending the Country
    Li Zhuang
    The movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country is a great, widespread, mass-based patriotic and internationalist movement. In this movement, ideological education on resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the home, and defending the country should be firmly grasped to raise the degree of political consciousness of the broad masses of the people in hating, despising, and disdaining U.S. imperialism.
    Because although U.S. imperialism's aggression against our country has a long history, some people have not been able to see its true face at once, because in the past it more often adopted the most vicious method of sweet words and a dagger hidden in its smile. Before World War II, the strength of U.S. imperialism in Asia was not strong enough to dominate China. Therefore, when other imperialists were loudly advocating the partition of China or the annexation of China, U.S. imperialism insisted on its so-called "open door" policy to various imperialists, and emphasized thousands of times that this was its "friendship" towards China. In fact, the purpose of the so-called "open door" was nothing more than the joint sharing of spoils by all imperialists in China. For imperialists other than the United States, it was merely to oppose their actions to exclude the United States from invading China. In essence, the United States is no different from other imperialists. The only difference is that the United States pays special attention to economic and cultural aggression in addition to military and political aggression against our country. After the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism has already taken the leading position in the dilapidated camp of imperialism. It no longer sings the platitude of "open door" to China, but wants to implement exclusive occupation. The various treaties signed by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government are manifestations of exclusive occupation of China. The large-scale civil war supported by U.S. imperialism and carried out by its running dog Chiang Kai-shek has seriously damaged the long-term and most shameless propaganda of deception carried out by U.S. imperialism in China. This June, after the United States invaded Korea and Taiwan, its aggressive face was exposed once again. However, we have not done enough work to expose U.S. imperialism, and there are still some extremely harmful influences among our people. Therefore, the people of our country must thoroughly eliminate these harmful influences in order to facilitate the organization of the life-and-death struggle of the people of the whole country against U.S. imperialist aggression.
    The content of the ideological education of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Home, and Defending the Country" basically has two aspects. One is to mobilize the people of the whole country to fully support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; the other is to educate the people of the whole country to hate, despise, and disdain U.S. imperialism, and to eliminate the ideological toxins spread by U.S. imperialism. The just actions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea are related to the security of our country and the cause of world peace. The enemy we face is U.S. imperialism, which is essentially very fragile but still very powerful in form. This struggle will still be very arduous for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the people of the whole country to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with all their strength and strive for the final victory. The people of the whole country must be of one mind, united in hatred against the enemy, and resolutely and confidently devote themselves to this glorious and great patriotic struggle.
    The central link in carrying out ideological education on resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the home, and defending the country is to first establish the idea of ​​hatred toward the United States. According to the experience of some areas, the most effective method to inspire the masses to hate U.S. imperialism is to use the vivid facts of imperialist oppression of the Chinese people that the masses have personally experienced or seen, and to accuse U.S. imperialism in public. This accusation should also be unified with the accusation of the crimes of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. This can centrally demonstrate the infinite crimes of U.S. imperialism as the world's reactionary center today, and thus inspire infinite hatred for U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek owe too many blood debts in China. The people of our country have suffered their oppression for too long. There is no more effective way to mobilize the masses widely and deeply than this kind of accusation. In the past, during the land reform, accusation meetings aroused a high degree of hatred among the peasants towards the landlord class; during the Liberation War, accusation meetings aroused a high degree of hatred among the peasants, liberated soldiers, and defecting soldiers towards the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Now, it is time for this fire of hatred to turn towards U.S. imperialism.
    After the people's hatred has risen, much work must be done to resolve the fear of the United States. This should mainly explain the experience of Chinese and foreign revolutionary history to the people, as well as the comparison of the strength of the two camps at present, and explain the principle that the United States is bound to be defeated and the people are bound to win. After the people are universally awakened, their power is invincible. Thirteen years ago, the people of our country launched a vigorous anti-Japanese national salvation movement and finally defeated Japanese imperialism, which invaded our country. Now, let us launch a broader and deeper movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend the home, and defend the country to smash U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea and our country. The domestic and international environment we are in now is very different from what it was thirteen years ago, and U.S. imperialism has more difficulties than Japanese imperialism at that time. As long as we strive unremittingly, victory will surely belong to us.

    普及与深入抗美援朝保家卫国的思想教育
    李庄
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动，是一个伟大的广泛群众性的爱国主义与国际主义的运动。在这个运动中，应抓紧抗美援朝保家卫国的思想教育，以提高广大人民群众仇视、鄙视和蔑视美帝国主义的政治觉悟程度。
    因为，美帝国主义侵略我国虽有了长久的历史，但由于它过去比较更多采取口蜜腹剑的最恶毒的办法，有些人对它的面貌，还一下看不出来。在第二次世界大战以前，美帝国主义在亚洲的力量还不够强大，不能独霸中国，因此，在其他帝国主义高唱瓜分中国或吞并中国的时候，美帝国主义却对各个帝国主义坚持其所谓“门户开放”的政策，并千百次强调这是它对中国的“友好”，其实，所谓“门户开放”的目的，对中国来说，不过是各帝国主义在中国实行联合分赃。对美国以外的其他帝国主义来说，不过反对它们排斥美国侵略中国的行动而已。在本质上，美国与其他帝国主义并没有丝毫区别，所不同的，是美国在对我国进行军事侵略与政治侵略之外，特别注重经济侵略和文化侵略而已。第二次世界大战结束之后，美帝国主义已经在帝国主义残破的阵营内取得了领导的地位，他对中国已不再唱“门户开放”的滥调，而是要实行独占了。美帝国主义与蒋介石反动政府所订的各种条约，都是独占中国的表现。由美帝国主义一手支持的，由其走狗蒋介石执行的大规模的内战，使美帝国主义在中国进行的长期的最无耻的欺骗宣传，受到了严重的打击。今年六月，美国侵略朝鲜台湾之后，它的侵略面貌，又有一次新的揭露。不过，关于揭露美帝国主义的工作，我们还作得不够，在我们人民中，还有些极端有害的影响。因此，我国人民必须彻底肃清这些有害的影响，以利于组织全国人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的生死斗争。
    “抗美援朝保家卫国”思想教育的内容，基本上有两个方面。一是动员全国人民，全力支援我国人民志愿部队；一是教育全国人民，仇视、鄙视和蔑视美帝国主义，扫除美帝国主义所散布的思想毒素。我国人民志愿部队在朝鲜的正义行动，是关系于我国的安全和世界和平事业的。我们所面对的敌人，是在本质上十分脆弱但在形式上还很强大的美帝国主义。这个斗争，在一定时期内还是很艰苦的。因此，必须动员全国人民，以一切力量支援我国人民志愿部队，争取最后的胜利。全国人民必须万众一心，同仇敌忾，有决心有信心地投入这个光荣伟大的爱国斗争。
    进行抗美援朝保家卫国思想教育的中心环节，首先树立仇美的思想，根据某些地区的经验，最有效的启发群众仇视美帝国主义的方法，则是用群众亲身经受过或看见过的帝国主义压迫中国人民的活生生的事实，用公开的形式控诉美帝国主义。这个控诉，并且应当和对日本帝国主义与国民党反动派罪恶的控诉，统一起来，这就可以集中表现美帝国主义今天是世界反动中心的无限罪恶，因而激发对美帝国主义的无限仇恨。美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国的血债是太多了，我国人民遭受他们的压迫是太久了，再没有比这种控诉方式，能普遍与深入地动员群众了。过去，在土地改革中，控诉会曾经激发了农民对于地主阶级的高度仇恨；在解放战争中，控诉会曾经激发了农民、翻身战士和解放战士对于蒋介石匪帮的高度仇恨。现在，这个仇恨的怒火，是转向美帝国主义的时候了。
    在人民的仇恨起来之后，还须作很多的工作，才能解决恐美心理，这主要应当向人民说明中外革命历史的经验，以及目前两个阵营力量的对比，说明美国必败，人民必胜的道理。人民普遍觉悟起来之后，力量是无敌的。十三年前，我国人民曾经开展了轰轰烈烈的抗日救国运动，终于打倒了侵略我国的日本帝国主义。现在，让我们开展一个更广泛更深入的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，以粉碎美帝国主义对于朝鲜和我国的侵略。我们现在所处的国内外环境，比十三年以前大不相同，美帝国主义比那时的日本帝国主义还有更多的困难。只要我们奋斗不懈，胜利一定属于我们的。
