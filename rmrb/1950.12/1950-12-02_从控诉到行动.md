    From Denunciation to Action
    Zhou Tian
    Beginning November 20th, workers at the Beijing Tram Company held three consecutive mornings of denunciation meetings to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation. Before the denunciations, students from Peking University performed short plays like "A Bloody Shirt" and "The Death of Wang En'di," which greatly inspired the workers. After the meetings, Wang Zhenwu, the deputy manager of the company, gave a summary report. Each afternoon, there were group discussions, and on a voluntary basis, everyone put forward their respective voluntary actions. Finally, Comrade Han Boping, deputy secretary of the Party branch, gave a current affairs report, further strengthening the workers' confidence in the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.
    Over the three days, nineteen workers denounced the atrocities of American imperialism.窦杰臣, an old worker of sixty-eight years old, also took the stage to denounce. He said that as early as fifty years ago, during the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance, American imperialism was one of them. They entered Beijing, raping, looting, and killing, committing all kinds of evil. He personally witnessed two women, a mother and daughter, being raped by American soldiers on Niujie Street outside Xuanwu Gate. Driven by shame and indignation, the two women hanged themselves with a rope. Liu Yuzhen, a female ticket seller, denounced that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders went to her village to plunder and raped her sister. Finally, they took her away, and on the way, unable to bear the humiliation of the Japanese invaders, her sister jumped into a well and killed herself. These beasts then returned to ask her mother for the person, but of course no one gave them anyone, and as a result, they were also stabbed to death with bayonets. Old worker Liu Huizhang also denounced that during the Anti-Japanese War, he was beaten until his face was bleeding by a Japanese advisor for not buttoning his collar properly, and he had to admit his mistake to them. Another time, during the Kuomintang rule, he was knocked unconscious for asking an officer for a tram ticket.
    Everyone denounced their own history of blood and tears under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs. In fact, this was not just the suffering of nineteen people, but the suffering of the entire tram workers, the suffering of the entire working people! While denouncing, they contrasted it with today's life. The days of being insulted, beaten, and bullied, of not having enough to eat or wear, are gone forever. Just as worker Liu Huizhang said: "Who has stood up? It is our working people who have stood up!" This clear contrast is a great encouragement to every worker.
    After this denunciation, the workers' class consciousness and understanding of American imperialism took a step forward. Worker Li Linjun said in a group discussion after the denunciation meeting: "If we are not aware now, then we are not Chinese." Zhao Weihan said: "Today I know where the suffering I endured in the past came from." Xu Zhonghua, a worker who usually doesn't like to talk, also said: "I have grown up and didn't know that imperialism was so hateful. Now I can recognize imperialism." Ma Tengyuan said: "In the past, I only knew that the US dollar was valuable, but today I know that it is its economic aggression." After listening to the workers' denunciations, the content of current affairs study for the staff was also enriched. In the past, they mostly engaged in theoretical discussions based on empty concepts, but today most people can talk in connection with themselves, and their political consciousness has also been raised. Feng Wentai said: "In the past, I found it ridiculous to see Beijing university students demonstrating against America, but today I feel that I was really ridiculous and hateful at that time!"
    After the denunciation and group discussions, everyone voluntarily put forward their own goals. First of all, in terms of production, most workers proposed to do a good job in production in their own positions, to ensure that the points are not slow, the cars are even, no runs are missed, and no one is late. Some people even proposed to strengthen mutual assistance. For example, ticket seller Ding Zhenfu proposed: "Guarantee not to miss a single ticket, and as long as there is a little time, I will definitely come out to help." Zhao Xufu said: "How do we resist America and aid Korea? The driver's key and the ticket seller's pen are our weapons." The entire group of the Second Team of Route 2 even proposed: "In order to resist America and aid Korea, we must launch a patriotic production competition, step up the study of the Tram Company Covenant, and implement the Covenant." The workers also proposed to obey the leadership under any circumstances, persevere in their work, consolidate the rear, heighten vigilance, and prevent traitors and special agents. Female ticket seller Zhao Ailian said: "We must strengthen our vigilance, and pay attention to the sabotage of special agents in the factory or on the tram at any time." Fan Xixian said: "We must get to the bottom of rumors." The workers of the Second Shift of Route 1 put forward the slogan "Everyone must be a public security officer" in the discussion.
    Many workers are preparing to write letters of慰问 (condolences and encouragement) to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist America and Aid Korea, and send慰问袋 (comfort bags). write letters of慰问 to the Korean Volunteer Army, and send慰问袋 (comfort bags).

    从控诉到行动
    周天
    北京电车公司车路工人曾于十一月二十起一连三天上午，举行了抗美援朝保家卫国的控诉大会。控诉前有北大同学演出《一件血衣》和《王恩弟之死》等短剧，对工人启发很大；会后该公司王镇武副经理作了总结报告。每天下午有小组讨论，在志愿基础上每个人都提出了各自的志愿行动。最后有党总支副书记韩伯平同志的时事报告，进一步加强了工人对抗美援朝的胜利信心。
    三天中有十九个工人控诉了美帝的暴行。六十八岁的老工人窦杰臣也上台控诉了。他说早在五十年前，八国联军侵略中国，美帝国主义就是其中的一个。他们进了北京城，奸淫烧杀，无恶不作。他亲眼看见在宣武门外牛街有母女两人被美国兵强奸，激于羞愤，两个人缚了一条绳上吊自杀了。女售票员刘玉珍控诉，在抗日战争时期，日寇到她村里去抢掠，强奸了她的姐姐。最后，把人带走，路上因不堪日寇凌辱，她的姐姐跳井自杀了。这群野兽又回来向她母亲要人，当然没有人给他们，结果也被他们用刺刀挑死了。老工人刘汇章控诉的也是在抗日战争时期，他为了领口上的纽扣没有扣好，被日本顾问打得满脸流血，还得向他们承认错误。还有一次在国民党统治时期，因为向一个军官要电车票，被打得昏了过去。
    每个人都控诉了自己过去在帝国主义及其走狗统治下的血泪历史。实际上，这何止是十九个人的苦，而是整个车路工人的苦，整个劳动人民的苦！他们一边控诉一边和今天的生活相对照。过去被侮辱，挨打受气，吃不饱，穿不暖的日子，是一去永远不复返了。正像工人刘汇章所说：“谁翻了身呢？就是我们劳动人民翻了身！”这种显明的对比，对每个工人都是一个很大的鼓舞。
    经过了这次控诉，工人的阶级觉悟和对美帝的认识提高了一步。工人李林俊在控诉会后的小组讨论中说：“现在要再不觉悟，那就不是中国人了。”赵维汉说：“今天我可知道我过去受的苦是从那里来的了。”一个平常不爱说话的工人徐仲华也说：“我长这么大，就不知道帝国主义有这么可恶，这一下我可认清帝国主义了。”马腾元说：“我过去光知道美金值钱，今天才知道就是它的经济侵略。”职员们在听了工人们的控诉之后，时事学习的内容也充实了。过去他们多是从空洞的概念作理论上的讨论，今天大多数人都能联系自己来谈；政治觉悟也提高了。冯文台说：“过去我看到北京大学生反美游行，感到可笑，今天我感到那时的自己才真可笑可恨了！”
    经过了控诉和小组讨论，每人都志愿地提出了自己的奋斗目标。首先在生产上，大多数工人都提出了在自己的岗位上把生产搞好，保证不慢点，车当匀，不脱班，不迟到。有的人更提出加强互助。例如售票员丁振福提出：“保证不漏一张票，只要有一点时间，一定出来互助。”赵序甫说：“我们如何抗美援朝？司机的钥匙，售票的笔，就是我们的武器。”二路第二组全组工人更提出：“为了抗美援朝，要展开爱国主义的生产竞赛，加紧学习车路公约，贯彻公约。”工人们并提出在任何情况下，服从领导，坚持工作，巩固后方，提高警惕，防奸防特。女售票员赵爱莲说：“我们要加强警惕，无论在厂中或车路上都要随时注意特务分子的破坏。”范希贤说：“听见谣言，我们要追根。”一路二班工人在讨论中提出了“要作到每一个人都是一个公安员”的口号。
    有很多工人准备向朝鲜人民军和中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队写慰问信，送慰问袋。朝志愿部队写慰问信，送慰问袋。
