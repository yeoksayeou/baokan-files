Marching Towards Glorious Posts, Achieving Meritorious Service for the Motherland and People
Students and Workers in the Capital Respond to the Motherland's Call, Eagerly Preparing to Join Military Cadre Schools

[This Newspaper Reports] Following the joint decision by the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council regarding the recruitment of young students and young workers to various military cadre schools, published on December 1st, students and workers in the capital were elated and unanimously shouted: "The opportunity to serve the motherland and the people has arrived!"

The situation in schools is extremely enthusiastic.

The Communist Youth League, Student Union, and Trade Union of the Renmin University of China jointly stated in a letter to this newspaper: Over a thousand of our Youth League members and student trainees are already prepared to step onto the glorious posts of national defense construction and participate in the great patriotic struggle. We deeply understand that only by consolidating national defense construction can we ensure the security of the motherland; only by accelerating the strengthening of our steel-like armed forces can we teach the invading bandits the lesson they deserve. Since the enemy dares to disrupt our peaceful learning and life, we will go to new classrooms, to the motherland's vast skies, oceans, and borders, to bravely kill the enemy! We sincerely pledge: to temper ourselves in battle to become well-rounded soldiers with both literary and military skills, to become Mao Zedong's young, vigorous eagles and people's soldiers! That afternoon, the school's "Recommendation Committee" was established. Trainees are signing up in entire Youth League branches and entire departments and classes.

Upon seeing the decision, students at Peking University were exceptionally excited. After seeing the newspaper, the Department of Western Languages immediately put up a wall poster suggesting that the Student Union establish a "Recommendation Committee" as soon as possible. Hao Zhuren, a student at the School of Medicine, read the decision more than a dozen times, memorized the entire text, and immediately ran to the classroom to tell others. Chen Shousong, a student at Peking University of Technology, said: "Although my leg has a slight problem, I am willing to learn the spirit of the legless Soviet pilot in 'Steel Will' and resolutely join the Air Force."

Twenty-two students from Tsinghua University had already joined the teaching work of the People's Navy. When the news arrived on the 1st, students everywhere were jumping and shouting: "The motherland's call that we have been waiting for day and night has finally arrived!" After the Student Union read the decision and this newspaper's editorial to all students in the large dining hall at noon, cheers, applause, and the sound of dishes, bowls, and chopsticks clattering filled the air. Departments such as Mechanical Engineering Three, Civil Engineering Two, and Electrical Engineering Two automatically lined up to sign up. Some students immediately ran to the city for physical examinations. Some students wanted to join the Navy, while others wanted to join the Air Force. Yang Ningzu, a student in Electrical Engineering Two, said: "If I fly airplanes on aircraft carriers, then I will be both in the Navy and the Air Force!"

On the 1st, when the Fourth District's middle schools held a patriotic and anti-American cultural program performance at Huabei Middle School, the venue was plastered with slogans such as "Respond to the Government's Call!" and "Actively Participate in National Defense Construction!" When the presidium of the conference reported this decision, the applause shook the entire auditorium like a volcanic eruption. Inside and outside the venue were immediately filled with voices such as "I have decided to join the Navy!" "I have decided to join the Air Force!" "Where do I sign up?" "Is my health good enough?"

Zhang Zhibin and twenty-five other fourth-year students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at National Peking Institute of Technology immediately signed up in response to the call. Hebei Provincial Normal School convened the inaugural meeting of the "Military Cadre School Provincial Normal School Recommendation Committee" that evening. Wang Shiqi and ten other students from Beijing Normal University wrote to this newspaper, expressing their willingness to step onto the glorious posts of national defense construction.

Zhang Zhijian's Combat Team of seven students from the Hui Nationality College, Paul Korchagin's Combat Team of fifteen students, and Zhong Buqing and others all expressed their desire to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of Hui youth and participate in military cadre schools.

Many students at Yenching University, the 工学院 of 华北大学, Jiaotong University's 京院, Municipal Middle Schools 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, Women's Middle School 1, Women's Middle School 3, Hebei High School, Normal University Affiliated Middle School, Normal University Women's Affiliated Middle School, Labor Middle School, Yu Ying, Bei Man, Da Tong, Yi Wen, and Chong Ci Girls' Middle School, etc., felt like they were celebrating a joyful festival, and smiles were on everyone's faces. Students are all discussing what you will join and what I will join.

In factories, a similar wave of enthusiasm has been set off.

When the workers of the Xinji Pharmaceutical Factory saw the newspaper at lunchtime, they didn't even bother to eat their meals, and more than forty people immediately surrounded the newspaper bulletin board. Production experts Wang Hao and Zhao Xingzhi rushed to ask the Youth League branch to recommend them. At noon, a dozen workers shouted military commands in the yard and began practicing military drills.

Wang Maoshen, a member of the Communist Youth League at the Dong Chang'an Street Business Office of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, and three other young workers and nine League members from the bureau immediately called the Youth League Committee to register. Tong Guoliang, Feng Yulin, Wei Xiqing, and other members of the Communist Youth League at the Beijing Electric Power Bureau also expressed their response to the call to the Youth League General Branch. Liu Fushan, a member of the Communist Youth League at the Beijing Machinery Factory, had repeatedly requested to join the Aid Korea Volunteer Army. After seeing this news, he happily said: "This time, I might be able to go!" Some young workers said: "China lacks a Navy and Air Force, but this is great!"

Within moments of receiving this news, three members of the Communist Youth League at the Beijing Public Transport Company had requested to register with the company's Communist Youth League Committee. Communist Youth League member Yu Yuanchen said: I can drive tanks and must be recommended to a military school. Communist Youth League member Duan Tiecheng has requested the Communist Youth League Committee to recommend him to a special forces school; Communist Youth League member Huo Zhentian has requested to be recommended to study at an air force school. Liu Xizhi, a young worker, used to be a mechanic in the Kuomintang Air Force, but later, unable to bear the oppression, he deserted. As soon as he saw the enrollment news in the newspaper, he immediately took the newspaper to the Youth League General Branch to request enrollment in an air force school. Sun Wenzhang from the Water Company, seven League members from the 70th Ordnance Factory, and eleven League members from the Road Engineering Office also firmly requested to register to participate.

    走向光荣岗位  为祖国人民立功
    首都学生工人响应祖国号召  纷纷准备参加军事干部学校
    【本报讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院关于招收青年学生青年工人参加各种军事干部学校的联合决定，于十二月一日发表后，首都学生、工人欢欣鼓舞，一致高呼：“为祖国和人民建功立业的时机到了！”
    在学校中，情况十分热烈。
    中国人民大学青年团、学生会和工会联合给本报的信中说：我们全校一千余青年团员和青年学员，早已经准备着走上国防建设的光荣岗位，参加伟大的卫国斗争。我们深深知道：只有巩固国防建设，才能保障祖国安全；只有加速增强钢铁般的武装力量，才能使得侵略强盗得到应有的教训。敌人既然胆敢破坏我们和平的学习生活，我们就走上新的课堂，到祖国辽阔的天空、海洋和边疆，去勇敢杀敌！我们忠诚立志：在战斗中锻炼自己成为文武双全的战士，成为毛泽东的年青矫健的鹰和子弟兵！当天下午该校“保送委员会”已经成立。学员们都在整个团支部、整个系班地签名参加。
    北京大学学生看到决定后，同学们异常兴奋。西语系看到报纸后，立刻贴出墙报，建议学生会尽早成立“保送委员会”。沙医学生郝铸仁一连把这个决定读了十几遍，把全文背下来后，立刻跑到教室里去告诉别人。北工学生陈寿松说：“我的腿虽然有点毛病，但我愿意学习‘钢铁意志’里苏联的无腿飞行员的精神，坚决参加空军。”
    清华大学学生早已有二十二人参加了人民海军教学工作。一日这个消息传来后，学生们到处跳着、喊着：“天天等待着的祖国号召，这下子可盼来了！”中午学生会在大饭厅向全体同学宣读了这个决定和本报当天的社论后，欢呼，鼓掌和菜盆、碗筷敲打声响成一片。机三、土二、电二等系级自动排起队签名。有的学生马上跑到城里去检查身体。有的学生想当海军，又想当空军。电二学生杨宁祖说：“我驾驶航空母舰上的飞机，那么，就既是海军又是空军了！”
    四区各中学一日在华北中学开抗美援朝保家卫国文艺节目会演大会时，会场所在地，华北中学到处贴满了“响应政府号召！”“积极参加国防建设！”的标语。当大会主席团报告了这个决定后，掌声像火山爆发似地撼动了整个礼堂。会场内外立刻充满了“我决定参加海军！”“我决定参加空军！”“在那里报名？”“我的身体可以吧？”的声音。
    国立北京高工机械科四年级学生张治彬等二十六人马上签名响应号召。河北省师当天晚上便召开了“军事干部学校省师保送委员会”成立大会。北京师范王士奇等十一个学生写信给本报，表示自愿走上国防建设的光荣岗位。
    回民学院学生张志坚战斗队七人、保尔柯察金战斗队十五人及钟布青等，都表示要发挥回民青年革命传统，参加军事干部学校。
    燕大、华大工学院、交大京院、市立一中、二中、四中、五中、六中、八中、女一中、女三中、河北高中、师大附中、师大女附中、劳动中学、育英、贝满、大同、艺文、崇慈女中等校，好多学生都像过着愉快的节日，每一个人的脸上都呈现着笑容。学生们都在纷纷讨论着你参加什么，我参加什么。
    在工厂中，同样也掀起了热潮。
    新建制药厂的职工们，午饭时看到报纸，连饭都顾不得吃了，贴报栏旁边立即围了四十多个人。生产能手王浩及赵兴芝抢着要求团支部保送。中午有十几个工人在院子内高喊着军队的口令，练起军操来。
    北京电信局东长安街营业处团员汪懋申及该局另外三个青工、九个团员看到报后，马上打电话给团委会要求报名。北京电业局团员佟国梁、冯玉琳、魏熙清等也纷纷向团总支表示响应号召。北京机械厂团员刘福山曾一再要求参加援朝志愿部队，他看到这个消息后，高兴地说：“这回我可能够去了！”有些青工说：“中国就缺乏海军、空军，这一下可好了！”
    北京市公共汽车公司在得到这个消息后的片刻间就有三个青年团员向该公司青年团委员会要求报名。青年团员于元臣说：我会驾驶战车，一定要保送我去军事学校。青年团员段铁成已向青年团委员会要求保送去特种兵学校；青年团员火真田则要求保送去学空军。青工柳溪之，原来在国民党空军里当机械士，后来受不了压迫，开小差跑了。这次他一看到报纸上招生的消息，马上拿着报纸找团总支要求报名入空军学校。自来水公司的孙文章，七十兵工厂的七个团员和道路工程事务所的十一个团员也都坚决要求报名参加。
