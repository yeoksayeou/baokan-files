    Uzbekistan's Cotton Planting Industry Develops
    Cotton Harvest Doubles That of the United States
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, 1st] TASS dispatch from Tashkent: The Uzbek Republic has fulfilled the state's raw cotton delivery plan ahead of schedule. Alimov, Minister of Cotton Planting of Uzbekistan, told a TASS reporter that this is a great labor victory for the Uzbek people and their contribution to the peace movement. The total cotton output of Uzbekistan has increased several times compared with before the revolution. This is not only due to the expansion of the planting area, but also to the application of scientific methods and the use of machinery. The huge scientific institutions established by the Republic have helped collective farms and state farms use the latest agricultural techniques and plant high-yielding cotton seeds. The cotton planting methods used by these farms are all mechanized. The cotton picking machine designed by Soviet engineers in a short period of time is much better than the cotton picking machine that Americans spent many years designing. Several thousand such cotton picking machines were used in the Republic's cotton fields this year.
    In terms of cotton harvest, Uzbekistan has left all capitalist countries and dependent countries far behind. For example, Uzbekistan's cotton harvest is twice that of the United States. Many collective farms harvest an average of 30 centners (Editor's note: each centner is equal to 50 kilograms) to 50 centners of cotton per hectare, and dozens of work teams have harvested 70 centners or even 90 centners.
    Delivering cotton to the state has brought a lot of income to the collective farms in Uzbekistan. All the collective farms in the Republic receive more than one million rubles in income a year, without exception. For example, the Stalin Jiji Collective Farm in Andijan Oblast received 18 million rubles, 1,450 tons of wheat, and a large amount of cottonseed oil as compensation for delivering cotton.
    The income from cotton planting enables the Republic's collective farms to carry out large-scale construction of housing, cultural and other undertakings. This year, 20,000 collective farmers have moved into well-equipped new homes.

### 乌兹贝克植棉业发展  棉花收成等于美国的两倍

    乌兹贝克植棉业发展
    棉花收成等于美国的两倍
    【新华社讯】塔斯社塔什干一日电：乌兹贝克共和国已经提前履行国家缴纳原棉的计划。乌兹贝克植棉部部长阿里莫夫告塔斯社记者称：这是乌兹贝克人民巨大的劳动胜利和他们对和平运动的贡献。乌兹贝克棉花的总产量较革命前已增加了几倍。这不仅是因为扩大了播种面积，也是因为应用科学化方法和使用机器的结果。共和国设立的庞大科学机关，帮助了集体农场和国家农场使用最新的农业技术方法，并种植了收获量丰富的棉种。这些农场使用的植棉方法都是机械化的。苏联工程师在短时期内设计的摘棉机，较美国人花去许多年时间所设计的摘棉机要好得多。今年在共和国的棉田上使用了几千具这样的摘棉机。
    关于棉花收成方面，乌兹贝克已把一切资本主义国家和附属国家远远抛在后面了。例如，乌兹贝克的棉花收成等于美国的两倍。许多集体农场平均每公顷收获棉花三十生丁纳（编者按：每生丁纳合五十公斤）到五十生丁纳，有几十个工作队则收获了七十生丁纳甚至九十生丁纳。
    向国家缴纳棉花，给乌兹贝克集体农场带来了大量的收入。共和国所有的集体农场一年都得到一百多万卢布的收入，没有一个例外。例如，安集延州的斯大林吉集体农场缴纳棉花得到的报酬是一千八百万卢布，一千四百五十吨小麦和大量的棉籽油。
    从植棉方面得到的收入，使共和国的集体农场能够进行关于住宅以及文化和其它事业的大规模建设。今年已有两万集体农民迁入设备良好的新住宅。
