Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th: Today, *Pravda* published a dispatch from its New York correspondents, Rasadin and Filippov, entitled "The American Governor-General of Western Europe." The dispatch reads: "On December 22nd, Acheson delivered a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a closed session regarding the results of the Brussels meeting of the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Alliance. The U.S. State Department specifically issued a statement to the press regarding this meeting. When commenting on this statement, newspapers primarily mentioned the agreement reached at the Brussels meeting regarding the establishment of the so-called 'unified European army' of the North Atlantic bloc and the appointment of General Eisenhower as the supreme commander of this army."

The correspondents continued: "It is well known that American military leaders have long attempted to gain command of the armies of the North Atlantic vassal states. To dispose of the Western European cannon fodder at will is the purpose they crave. Currently, the American ruling group believes that the realization of this goal is imminent."

"During the discussion of Acheson's secret report to the Senate committee, American newspapers asserted that General Eisenhower would be granted unlimited powers. He would be authorized to establish direct contact with the heads of state of the North Atlantic Alliance countries regarding the organization and use of the European armed forces under his command."

"The newspapers pointed out that the fact that new American troops will be sent to Europe to strengthen the European armies is enough to illustrate that the real issue is to abolish the sovereignty of Western European countries, turn them into American barracks, and appoint General Eisenhower as the military governor-general of Western Europe."

"However, the problem is not only that Western European countries are militarily subordinate to American imperialists, but also that they are completely enslaved by them economically. Acheson announced that along with Eisenhower, an American economic governor-general would be dispatched to Europe, who would be responsible for managing the Western European economy and preparing it for war."

"In Washington, a so-called International Security Problems Committee has been established. According to the announcement, it will coordinate the relationship between the U.S. military and the militaries of the North Atlantic Alliance countries and will guide military and economic mutual assistance... The fact that industrialist and financier Cabot leads this committee and that Truman's advisor, the financial magnate Harriman, is also a member is enough to prove what the result of economic mutual assistance will actually be."

Rasadin and Filippov continued, "Just as Chamberlain shouted that he had saved Europe from war after signing the Munich Agreement with Hitler, so too did U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, upon returning from Brussels, describe the imperialists' agreement to revive the West German fascist army as a great contribution to the cause of peace. The most shameful and heinous alliance of American militarists and fascist mercenaries is touted as the main achievement of American foreign policy."

"*The New York Herald Tribune* openly hinted on December 20th that the generals of the Hitler gang would receive the support of tank forces and air force, which is not to say that German infantry divisions would not be established. *The Daily Worker* said that due to the decision in Brussels to first establish a 200,000-strong West German army, Acheson and Eisenhower have allowed the fascists to make a comeback. American newspapers do not conceal that Washington mainly relies on the West German army to prepare for aggression in Europe."

"As for General Eisenhower, on the day he was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the unified European army of the North Atlantic bloc, he hurriedly said that he would be happy to command the West German army. His fame can be explained by the phrase 'We were also there.' He is being promoted as a 'military genius,' and his responsibility is to 'inspire' Europe and 'save Europe from communism.'"

Rasadin and Filippov concluded by pointing out that Rommel's chief of staff, the fascist General Speidel, who previously occupied France, has been appointed as Eisenhower's assistant to organize the West German army. American newspapers almost depict him as a natural anti-fascist. This is how psychological preparations are being made for the open alliance between Wall Street and West German fascists.

### “西欧的美国总督”  真理报记者论艾森豪威尔的新任命

    “西欧的美国总督”
    真理报记者论艾森豪威尔的新任命
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电：真理报今日刊载拉萨丁与费利波夫的纽约通讯，题名为“西欧的美国总督”。通讯写道：十二月二十二日，艾奇逊在参院外交委员会的秘密会议上发表了关于北大西洋联盟国家外长布鲁塞尔会议结果的报告。美国国务院曾特别就这次会议向报界发表过一个声明。报纸在评论这一声明时，主要提到的是布鲁塞尔会议上关于建立北大西洋集团的所谓“欧洲统一军队”和任命艾森豪威尔将军为这支军队的最高司令的协议。
    记者继称：大家知道，美国军事头领们很久以来就企图取得北大西洋附庸国军队的指挥权。随心所欲地支配西欧的炮灰，这就是他们所渴求的目的。目前，美国统治集团认为这个目的的实现已在眼前。
    在讨论艾奇逊在该参院委员会中所作秘密报告时，美国各报断言艾森豪威尔将军将被赋予无限的权力，他将受权就组织及使用他统率下的欧洲武装部队的问题直接与北大西洋联盟各国元首建立联系。
    各报指出，新的美国军队将被派往欧洲，以加强欧洲军队，只此一点便足说明，真正症结所在是要取消西欧各国的主权，将它们变成美国的军营、并且任命艾森豪威尔将军为西欧的军事总督。
    然而问题所在还不仅是西欧国家在军事上从属美帝国主义者，而且在经济上也完全受他们的奴役。艾奇逊宣布，与艾森豪威尔一起，将派遣一位美国经济总督到欧洲去，他将负责管理西欧经济，并且使之为战争进行准备。
    在华盛顿已建立了所谓国际安全问题委员会，依照宣布，它将调配美国军队与北大西洋联盟各国军队之间的关系，并且将指导军事上与经济上的互助……工业家与财政家卡波特领导这个委员会并且杜鲁门的顾问金融巨头哈里曼也是委员之一，仅仅这一事实就足以证明经济互助实际上将有什么结果。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫继称，正如张伯伦在与希特勒签订了慕尼黑协定后便大叫他已拯救了欧洲免于战祸一样。美国国务卿艾奇逊自布鲁塞尔回来时也把帝国主义者关于复活西德法西斯军队的协议说成是对和平事业的巨大贡献。把美国军人与法西斯佣兵的最可耻最罪恶的联盟说成是美国外交政策的主要成就。
    《先驱论坛报》在十二月二十日公开暗示，希特勒匪帮的将军们将得到坦克部队和空军的支援，而这并不是说不成立德国步兵师。《工人日报》说，由于布鲁塞尔的首先成立二十万西德陆军的决定，艾奇逊和艾森豪威尔就准许法西斯分子卷土重来。美国报纸并不掩饰，华盛顿主要依靠西德陆军在欧洲进行侵略的准备。
    至于艾森豪威尔将军，他在被任命为北大西洋集团欧洲统一军队最高司令的那一天，就连忙说，他将乐于指挥西德的军队。他的英名可以用“我们也在那里”这句话来说明。他正被宣扬为“军事天才”，他的责任是“激励”欧洲，“拯救欧洲免于共产主义”。
    拉萨丁和费利波夫在结语中指出，前占领法国的隆美尔的参谋长、法西斯将军斯派达尔已被任命为艾森豪威尔的助手以组织西德陆军，美国报纸几乎把他描绘为天生的反法西斯分子。这就是为了华尔街和西德法西斯分子公开联盟进行心理准备的方法。
