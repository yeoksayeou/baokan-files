    【Report from this newspaper】 Upon hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, Korean residents in Beijing celebrated this major victory of the Chinese and Korean people fighting shoulder to shoulder against America with boundless excitement.

    Kim Un-juk, wife of Lee Joo-yeon, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, expressed her feelings to the reporter, saying, "It has been exactly one and a half months since the withdrawal from Pyongyang to its liberation. The dispatch of the Chinese People's Volunteers has greatly strengthened the Korean people's confidence in driving the American imperialists out of Korea at an early date. The liberation of Pyongyang is a great lesson to American imperialism, and it once again declares to the world that the power of the people cannot be defeated, and the imperialist delusion of invading the East will never succeed. Today, more than 5,700 students came to the gate of our embassy to cheer and celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang. Our excitement and gratitude cannot be expressed in words. On behalf of Korean women, I would like to thank the great Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. We have experienced temporary setbacks, but this has never discouraged us. Today, our strength has been strengthened, and our confidence in victory has been further enhanced. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side to continue to annihilate the remaining enemies, and we will surely achieve final victory."

    Ma Chaoqun, a Korean professor in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, said, "When the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached Peking University, the whole school was in an uproar. Although it was night, the students still ran to the streets to parade and celebrate, which fully demonstrated the profound fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese people regard the just struggle of the Korean people as their own. The Korean people's liberation struggle has received the support of 500 million Chinese people and will surely achieve complete victory. However, before the American imperialists are completely driven out of the whole of Korea, we must strengthen our vigilance, redouble our efforts, and strive for the early arrival of complete victory." Li Qilie, another Korean professor in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, said, "When the American and Rhee bandit troops crossed the 38th parallel and invaded northern Korea, and the Korean people faced a serious crisis, the Chinese people resolutely formed the Volunteer Army and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield. This great friendship is something that the Korean people will always be grateful for. Today, the victory of Pyongyang is not our final victory. As long as the American aggressors and their running dog, the Rhee Syngman bandit gang, have not been wiped out and driven out of Korea, our struggle will not be relaxed for a single day."

    Jiang Caishun, the principal of the Korean Elementary School in Beijing, first expressed to reporters his deep gratitude for the internationalist assistance given to the Korean people by the Chinese people. She said: "Pyongyang has been liberated, and I am so happy that I can't speak. The only thing I can say is that we Korean people sincerely thank the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

    Jeon Deok-gyun, manager of the Beijing branch of the Korean Democratic Bookstore, said, "The people of China and Korea are determined to defeat our common enemy, the American imperialists. Many Korean compatriots have been killed, and Pyongyang and other cities in Korea have been madly destroyed by the American and Rhee bandit gangs. We must avenge the compatriots who died in the disaster, and we will surely rebuild the majestic new city of Pyongyang and many cities destroyed by the enemy."

    Go Gwang-il, a Korean car driver, drove to Dongdan today and saw seven parades passing through the streets, cheering and celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang. He was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He said, "The strength of the Chinese and Korean people is strong. We can not only liberate Pyongyang, but also liberate Seoul and liberate all of Korea."

    居住北京的朝鲜人士
    兴奋欢呼平壤解放           
    一致感激中国人民的友谊和援助
    【本报讯】平壤解放的消息传至北京以后，居住在北京的朝鲜人士，以无限兴奋的心情欢庆这次中朝人民并肩抗美的重大胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊夫人金云竹女士，对记者发表她的感想说：“平壤自撤退到解放整整是一个半月。中国人民志愿军的出动，大大增强了朝鲜人民早日把美帝国主义者驱逐出朝鲜的信心。平壤的解放，给美帝国主义一个很大的教训，这就再一次向全世界宣告，人民的力量是不可被战胜的，帝国主义妄想侵略东方是永远不会成功的。今天一整天，有五千七百多学生来到我们的大使馆门前欢呼庆祝平壤解放，我们的兴奋与感激是无法用言语形容的。我代表朝鲜妇女向伟大的毛主席、中国人民和中国人民志愿军致谢。我们经历过暂时的挫折，但这从来并未使我们气馁，今天，我们的力量加强了，胜利的信心更加提高了，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，继续追歼残敌，一定能得到最后胜利。”
    北京大学东方语文系朝鲜籍教授马超群说：“当平壤解放的消息传到北大时，全校沸腾了，虽然是夜晚，但是同学们还是跑到街上去游行庆祝，这充分表现了中朝人民兄弟般的深厚友谊。中国人民把朝鲜人民的正义斗争当作自己的事。朝鲜人民的解放斗争得到五万万中国人民的支援，一定能得到全面胜利的。但是，在美帝国主义没有被全部驱逐出全朝鲜之前，我们要加强警惕，加倍努力，争取全面胜利的早日到来。”北大东语系另一位朝鲜籍教授李启烈说：“当美李匪军越过三八线侵入朝鲜北部，朝鲜人民面临严重的危机时，中国人民毅然组成志愿军，到朝鲜战场和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，这种伟大的友谊，是朝鲜人民永远感激的。今天，平壤的胜利还不是我们最后的胜利，美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮一天未被消灭和驱逐出朝鲜，我们的斗争也一天不会放松。”
    北京市朝鲜人小学校校长姜彩顺首先向记者表示他对中国人民给予朝鲜人民的国际主义的援助十分感激。她说：“平壤解放了，我高兴得说不出话来，我唯一能说的，就是我们朝鲜人民衷心感谢伟大的毛主席和中国人民志愿军。”
    朝鲜民主书店北京分店经理全德钧说：“中朝两国人民都有决心打败共同的敌人美帝国主义者。许多朝鲜同胞被杀害了，平壤和朝鲜的其他城市被美李匪帮疯狂地破坏了，我们一定要为死难的同胞们复仇，我们一定能够重建起巍峨的新平壤城和许多被敌人破坏的城市。”
    朝鲜籍汽车驾驶员高光日，今天驾车到东单，看到七个游行队伍在大街上经过，欢呼庆祝平壤解放，他兴奋得流出泪来。他说：“中朝人民的力量是强大的，不仅能解放平壤，而且能解放汉城，解放全朝鲜。”
