    京电影宣传月第二期早场            
    观众达四万余人
    【本报讯】华北影片经理公司所主持的抗美援朝保家卫国电影宣传月早场的二期，自十二月四日开始以来，各院上座情况极为踊跃。截至本月十三日十天中，中央、北京、青年宫、红星、同乐、红楼等六院总人数已达四万一千一百九十八人。超过第一期一万人以上。总计两期观众达七万二千五百八十三人，更进一步地发挥了电影宣传的伟大作用。在每个角落里，买卖家、住户里，都普遍地谈论着“八女投江”、“赵一曼”、“小英雄伐尼亚”的故事。这说明了广大群众已从这些影片中受到了爱国主义与国际主义的教育和影响了。
    现在第三期已在首都、大华、新中国、蟾宫、胜利五院开始，定于本月二十三日为止。
