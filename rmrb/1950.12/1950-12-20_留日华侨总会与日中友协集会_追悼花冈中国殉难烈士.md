Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: A delayed dispatch from Tokyo: Under the auspices of the Overseas Chinese Association in Japan and the Japan-China Friendship Association, overseas Chinese in Japan and Japanese democrats solemnly held a "Memorial Meeting for the Hanaoka Martyrs" on November 1st at the Hongan-ji Temple in Asakusa, Tokyo. The meeting commemorated the four hundred and sixteen captured Chinese soldiers and conscripted Chinese laborers who were brutally murdered by Japanese reactionaries at the Hanaoka mine in northern Honshu, Japan, during the war. Representatives from overseas Chinese communities in Japan and representatives from twenty-two progressive organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Korean Student League, attended the meeting, totaling more than two thousand people. Yu Enyang, Vice President of the Overseas Chinese Association in Japan, spoke at the meeting, denouncing the Kuomintang remnant bandits' "Representative Delegation in Japan" and the Japanese authorities for obstructing the holding of the memorial meeting. He also criticized the Japanese government and "Kajima Corporation," a Japanese construction company and one of the masterminds of the atrocities, for obstructing the transfer of the victims' coffins from Hanaoka to Tokyo. In his report, Yu Enyang emphasized that similar tragedies to the Hanaoka incident occurred everywhere in Japan during the war, and the number of Chinese compatriots who sacrificed their lives was no less than 30,000. We demand a thorough investigation of the murderers and the prevention of similar incidents from happening again in Japan. Chinese and Japanese progressive groups unanimously pointed out in their eulogies the inherent cruelty of the Japanese fascist bandits and put forward the just demand to bring the murderers to justice. All participants vowed to fight to completely prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascism and to defend peace.
