    [Question] The People's Daily published an article on page 4 on December 12 entitled "After Suffering a Disastrous Defeat in Korea, U.S. Imperialism Conspires to Use Asians to Fight." How exactly did the United States carry out armed intervention in the Vietnamese people's liberation movement, both before and after Truman's statement on June 27? Please provide a brief introduction.

    [Answer] Since the end of World War II, the United States has used every means to help France conduct its colonial war in Vietnam, attempting to seize France's position as a colonizer in Vietnam and transform Vietnam into a U.S. colony. Particularly after the victory of our country's liberation war, U.S. imperialism has shamelessly attempted to use Vietnam as a military outpost to encircle and attack our country.

    After Japan's surrender in August 1945, MacArthur forbade the Japanese troops invading Vietnam from surrendering to or handing over weapons to the Vietnamese People's Resistance Democratic Government led by Ho Chi Minh at the time. Instead, he designated the 16th parallel north as the boundary, with the south surrendering to the British and the north to the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The United States and Britain jointly helped France restore its old rule, even using Japanese troops who had recently been fighting them to attack the Vietnamese people. From this time on, the weapons and ammunition used by the French army to massacre the Vietnamese people were mainly supplied by the United States.

    In 1947, due to the failure of the "Blitzkrieg" launched by the French colonialists, U.S. imperialism realized the importance of a policy of political disintegration. In September 1947 and February 1948, War-monger Bullitt, the former U.S. ambassador to France, twice went to Hong Kong on the orders of the U.S. State Department to instigate Bao Dai, the already-abdicated "nightclub emperor," to return to Vietnam. The so-called Franco-Vietnamese Agreement signed by Bao Dai and the French colonialists on March 8, 1949, was signed under U.S. pressure.

    When the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers held a conference in Paris in November 1949, Acheson and Schuman agreed that the United States would send a special mission to Vietnam to reorganize and train the French-puppet army, and that the United States would supply weapons and advisors. The farce of France and Bao Dai "transferring power" was soon staged in Saigon, the French-occupied area. The United States was the first to recognize this puppet regime, which was despised by the Vietnamese people. The United States also forced its vassal states in Asia to recognize the Bao Dai puppet, but it only received a response from the South Korean Syngman Rhee bandit gang and the Thai fascist regime of Luang Phibunsongkhram. Even its U.S. and French masters did not deny Bao Dai's isolation and corruption.

    After this, U.S. "envoys," "economic missions," and "military missions" continuously went to Vietnam to "investigate," "research," and even directly give various "instructions" to France and the Bao Dai puppet. U.S. "economic aid" and "military aid" also increased daily.

    In February of this year, U.S. Far East diplomatic personnel met in Bangkok and decided to provide military, economic, and financial assistance to the Bao Dai puppet and the French colonialists in Vietnam. They announced that 20 million USD would be allocated to the Bao Dai puppet from the "75 million USD for general aid to China" as "emergency military aid" to suppress the national liberation movement. U.S. roving ambassador Jessup, who presided over the Bangkok conference, went to Tra Luy after arriving in Vietnam and presented Acheson's "blessings" to Bao Dai. When he returned to Washington to report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he repeatedly emphasized that "Indochina is one of the most important issues in Southeast Asia at present," but it is "the weakest link in the Cold War being waged by the United States." Therefore, he suggested that "France should be firmly supported, and weapons, ammunition, and economic aid should be rapidly delivered."

    On March 6th of this year, the U.S. government sent a special mission led by Griffin to Saigon. Under the pretext of "studying the economic conditions of Vietnam," they attempted to implement the so-called "Truman's Point Four Program" to enslave the people in Vietnam. At the same time that Griffin's "economic mission" arrived in Vietnam, two destroyers of the U.S. Seventh Fleet arrived in Saigon, and 71 U.S. aircraft made provocative demonstration flights over the southern part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Following the Griffin mission, the United States dispatched another Robert Blum economic mission, which arrived in Saigon on May 30 to discuss with the French colonialists and the puppet regime the implementation of "U.S. economic aid" and announced that "U.S. economic aid to Indochina for the first year would be 23 million USD." In reality, they were using these to exploit the wealth and resources of the French-occupied areas of Vietnam.

    The Truman statement issued by the United States on June 27 only served to make the Wall Street's criminal plan to invade Vietnam more public. Especially after the Vietnamese People's Army won a great victory in northern Vietnam in mid-September, the Viet Bac interzone was basically liberated, and the attempt by U.S. and French imperialism to push the war to the Sino-Vietnamese border had been shattered. The People's Army took advantage of the victory to advance on the French base areas of Hanoi and Haiphong in northern Vietnam, and the rulers of the United States and France cried out in alarm that "the situation is serious."

    On July 15, the U.S. State Department dispatched the Melby military mission to Saigon to carry out the accelerated aggression against Vietnam mentioned in the Truman statement. This action indicates that the United States will directly command the dirty war of attacking the Vietnamese people.

    On October 4, the U.S. Department of Defense appointed Brigadier General Brink, a "guerrilla warfare expert and Far East expert," as the head of the U.S. military mission to Indochina. His task is to specifically manage the allocation and use of military assistance to Indochina. After arriving in Saigon on October 10, Brink announced: "U.S. military supplies will be delivered to the distressed French troops as soon as possible." Brink also went to Tokyo in early November. According to reports from reactionary U.S. journalists, he had a "highly confidential" important mission. When Truman and MacArthur met on Wake Island in mid-October to discuss a plan for a full-scale invasion of Asia, they decided to "strengthen the delivery of weapons and materials to French and Vietnamese troops." Brink's meeting with MacArthur in Tokyo shows that after repeated failures in its aggressive policy in Asia, the United States is still trying its best to struggle.

    Three batches of U.S. military supplies were shipped from the United States to Vietnam in October alone. Erskine, the head of the U.S. military mission in Southeast Asia, said in a broadcast in the United States on November 5 that military assistance must be given to the French forces in Indochina immediately. He believes that the situation has become so tense that "action must be taken immediately," and "we cannot waste any more time."

    However, due to the increasing strength of the Vietnamese people and the broad support they receive from the people of the world, there is no doubt that U.S. military supplies, advisors, and experts cannot save them from complete failure in Vietnam.

    美国干涉越南的罪行
    【问】人民日报十二月十二日第四版上刊有“美帝在朝鲜遭受惨败后阴谋利用亚洲人民作战”一稿，究竟美国在六月二十七日杜鲁门声明发表前以及以后怎样对越南人民解放运动进行武装干涉的？请简单介绍一下。
        北京读者黄哲、张世宇
    【答】自第二次世界大战结束后，美国即使用一切方法帮助法国在越南进行殖民战争，并企图以这种方法来夺取法国在越南的殖民者的地位，变越南为美国的殖民地；特别在我国解放战争获得胜利后，美帝更是无耻地企图将越南作为包围我国、进攻我国的军事前哨。
    一九四五年八月日本投降后，麦克阿瑟即禁止侵越日军向当时由胡志明所领导的越南人民抗战民主政府签降或缴出武器，而以北纬十六度为界，其南归英国受降，其北归蒋介石匪帮的军队。美国与英国一同帮助法国恢复旧日的统治，甚至使用不久前尚手执武器与他们作战的日军进攻越南人民。法军用以屠杀越南人民的武器与军火从这时起主要由美国供给。
    一九四七年由于法国殖民者所发动的“闪击战”的失败，美帝国主义者感觉到政治分化政策的重要。一九四七年九月和一九四八年二月，美国前驻法大使战争贩子布立特两度奉美国务院命令赴香港唆使业已退位的夜总会皇帝保大返越。一九四九年三月八日，由保大与法国殖民者签订的所谓法越协定就是在美国压力下签订的。
    一九四九年十一月美英法举行巴黎外长会议时，艾奇逊与舒曼同意由美国派遣一个特别使团赴越南改组并训练法伪军由美国供给武器及顾问人员。法国与保大“移交政权”的丑剧不久即在法占区西贡举行。美国首先承认了这个为越南人民唾弃的傀儡政权。美国也强迫它在亚洲的附庸国承认保大傀儡，但它只得到南朝鲜李承晚匪帮和泰国法西斯政权銮披汶政府的响应而已。保大傀儡的孤立与腐朽即是它的美法主子也不讳言。
    此后美国的“使节”、“经济使团”和“军事使团”即不断地赴越南“调查”、“研究”甚至直接给法国及保大傀儡各种“指示”。美国的“经济援助”及“军事援助”也逐日增加。
    今年二月美国远东外交人员集会曼谷，决定从军事、经济及财政方面援助保大傀儡及越南的法国殖民者，并宣布自“援助中国一般地区七千五百万美元”中拨出二千万美元给予保大傀儡充作“紧急的军事援助”，用以镇压民族解放运动。主持曼谷会议的美国巡回大使耶塞普抵越后亲赴茶叻，将艾奇逊的“祝福”献给保大。在他返回华盛顿向参议院外交委员会作报告时一再强调“印度支那为目前东南亚重要问题之一”，但那里却是“美国从事的冷战中最弱的一环”，因此他建议“应坚决支援法国，迅速输送武器弹药及经济援助。”
    今年三月六日，美国政府又派了由葛里芬率领的一个特别使团抵达西贡。以“研究越南经济条件”为名，企图在越南实行奴役人民的所谓“杜鲁门第四点计划”。与葛里芬“经济使节”抵越的同时，美国第七舰队的两艘驱逐舰开抵西贡，另有七十一架美国飞机在越南民主共和国的南部上空作挑衅性的示威飞行。
    继葛里芬使团之后，美国又派遣一个罗伯特·布鲁姆经济使团于五月三十日抵西贡，与法国殖民者及傀儡政权商谈执行“美国经济援助”各项事宜，并宣布“美国给印度支那第一年的经济援助为二千三百万美元”。实际是通过它们来榨取越南法占区的财富与资源。
    六月二十七日美国发表杜鲁门声明，只是说明华尔街侵略越南的罪恶计划更为表面化了。特别在九月中旬越南人民军在越北获得巨大胜利以后，越北联区基本上已告解放，美法帝国主义将战争推向中越边境的企图已遭受粉碎性的打击。人民军并乘胜进逼法国在越北的根据地河内海防地区，美国和法国的统治者都惊呼“局势严重”。
    七月十五日，美国务院为执行杜鲁门声明中所说的加速对越南的侵略行动特派遣梅尔拜军事使团赴西贡。这一行动就是表示美国将直接指挥进攻越南人民的肮脏战争。
    美国国防部于十月四日任命“游击战专家和远东专家”白林克准将为美国驻印度支那军事使团团长，他的任务是专司管理给予印度支那军事援助的分配与使用。白林克于十月十日抵西贡后即宣布：“美国军火将尽速地送给困窘的法军。”白林克又于十一月初间赴东京，据美国反动记者的报道，他负有“极为机密”的重要使命。十月中旬杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在威克岛会商全面侵略亚洲的计划时，即决定“加强运送武器及物资给法国及越南军队”。白林克赴东京与麦克阿瑟晤谈说明了美国在亚洲的侵略政策连续遭受失败之后仍图竭力挣扎。
    美国军火仅十月份内即有三批自美国运赴越南。东南亚美国军事使团团长厄斯琴十一月五日在美国发表广播，说必须立即给印度支那的法军以军事援助，他认为局势已紧张到“要马上动手”，“我们不能再浪费时间了”。
    但是由于越南人民力量的日益壮大及其所获得的世界人民的广大的支持，毫无疑问，美国的军火、顾问以及专家们是挽救不了它们在越南完全失败的命运的。
