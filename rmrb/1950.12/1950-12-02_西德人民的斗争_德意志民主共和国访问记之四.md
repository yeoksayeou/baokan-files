    The All-German Youth Peace Conference in Berlin gave me the opportunity to meet with many young people, workers, and people from other sectors from West Germany. I also had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Lehmann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, which helped me understand the struggle of the West German people to defend peace and fight for democratic reunification.

    Many West Germans told me that the crimes of American and British imperialism in dividing Germany and turning West Germany into a base for aggressive war were not recognized by the general public for a long time. Even two years ago, many people had illusions about the "Marshall Plan," believing that it could improve people's living standards. For many years, the reactionary propaganda of the Nazis and post-war American fascists prevented them from understanding the Soviet Union and its policies towards Germany.

    Think about it: on average, 80 percent of the public institutions in West Germany are former Nazis, 90 percent of the judicial departments are Nazis, and most of the teachers, newspaper editors, etc., are also fascist party members. The officers of Hitler's stormtroopers are swaggering through the streets again in the "police" uniforms issued by Washington and London. Around the Adenauer puppet government are gathered the forces of financial groups, landlords, and militarists. Under the control of the imperialist "High Commissioners," they act as loyal agents of Wall Street.

    However, the disasters brought by the "Marshall Plan" to the West German people are becoming increasingly serious and obvious, especially in the severe unemployment problem. According to West German official estimates, the number of unemployed people in West Germany will exceed four million by 1951. This threat of hunger and unemployment has made the vast majority of West German people concretely aware of the crimes of American and British imperialists. Julius Barech, a 32-year-old unemployed worker from Bavaria in the American occupation zone, told me: "We workers have seen clearly that the 'Marshall Plan' doesn't give you what you need, but what is surplus. For example, West Germany can manufacture gasoline, textiles, soap, and cigarettes, but only American and British goods are available in the market. What about German factories? Either production is prohibited, or the factories are dismantled. That's how I became unemployed. Even the vegetables imported from the Netherlands under the 'Marshall Plan' are cheaper than those produced in West Germany, making it impossible for vegetable farmers to survive."

    I think that although worker Barech's words are simple, they reveal the essence of the "Marshall Plan."

    Five years after the war, most of the farmers who moved back to West Germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other places still live in tents and rely on a "relief fund" of a dozen marks a week to maintain their lives. The Adenauer puppet government refuses to implement land reform and intensifies its clamor to these landless farmers: the only way out is to fight back east of the "Oder-Neisse line"!

    In the small auditorium of the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin, I met a delegation of people from all walks of life in the Ruhr area who came to visit West Germany. That day, Premier Grotewohl and Deputy Premier Ulbricht agreed to hold a forum with them. The delegation had twenty-two people, including workers, engineers, small factory owners, and businessmen. From their speeches, I learned that they had different understandings and party affiliations.

    But their common questions were: "How does the Democratic Republic government lead Germany on the road to democratic reunification?" "How to develop trade relations between East and West Germany?" "Can the Democratic Republic help solve the difficulties of the West German business community?" I noticed that Ulbricht gave a very positive answer to the third question, and said: "The products of the German Democratic Republic can be sold all the way to Beijing. As long as West German industrialists and businessmen provide a list of goods, we can trade on their behalf." The delegation applauded particularly vigorously when they heard these words. A small steel factory owner from Solingen, sitting next to me, complained about the American and British authorities restricting the export of steel to East Germany, which made business poor. I asked to talk to him in detail and asked his name. He waved his hands in fear and said, "Never, never publish my name! They (referring to the occupying authorities) will be terrible if they find out!"

    It was already the end of May. Hearing that Comrade Lehmann was about to leave Berlin and return to West Germany, I hurried to the Propaganda Bureau and arranged to talk with him about the situation in West Germany.

    I arrived at his residence at nine o'clock in the morning, and he was resting in an armchair. That early morning at seven o'clock, he had visited the campsite of a children's group in the suburbs of East Berlin to see the lives of more than 10,000 children. When the children saw him at the gate, they rushed up to surround him, shaking hands, touching his clothes, offering flowers, and those who couldn't squeeze to the front tried their best to squeeze and shout. The road leading to the children's campsite was temporarily blocked. Some of the older children already knew how to take pictures, so they climbed up the trees to take pictures. It took a full hour for him to gradually separate these naughty children and browse through the tents, the children's post office, and the children's club. Now, he had just returned to his residence.

    He asked me what questions I wanted to talk about, and I raised several areas. He seemed to be considering as he wrote it down. At this time, I noticed his radiant, strong face with a reddish-bronze luster, and immediately thought of his early life as a miner. He and comrades such as Thalmann and Pieck were members of the "Spartacus League" and one of the founders of the German Communist Party. After the Nazis came to power, he went underground and was thrown into a concentration camp in 1939, and was not liberated from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp until the Red Army arrived. Perhaps due to the long torture of prison life, although only fifty-one years old, his back was slightly hunched, and his hair was already gray.

    He started from the Potsdam Agreement: "The imperialists such as the United States and Britain never intended to implement the Potsdam Agreement."

    Our conversation turned to the "Marshall Plan" and the "Schuman Plan." He said: The disaster of the Marshall Plan has been increasingly added to the people of West Germany, and at the same time, it has become increasingly clear to the general public.

    At this time, someone called him, tens of thousands of young people who had come to Berlin from all over were about to return, waiting for him to speak.

    Comrade Lehmann put down the phone and continued to talk about the struggle of the West German people to defend peace, demand national reunification on a democratic basis, withdraw foreign occupation forces, and strive for an early signing of a peace treaty. The establishment of countless peace committees and friendly groups of the National Front Committee throughout West Germany, the workers' refusal to transport munitions, the strikes in munitions factories, and the struggle against "factory dismantling" prove that opposition to the American and British occupation and the conspiracy to divide Germany, colonize it, and use it as a base for aggressive war is the common will of the vast majority of the people.

    In order to achieve the above goals, the task of the German Communist Party and the West German working class is extremely important. In order to divide Germany's national unity, the imperialists attempt to split the unity of the working class through the reactionary leaders of the upper echelons of the Social Democratic Party, Shumacher. Schumacher and the Adenauer Group are both loyal running dogs of American and British imperialism; but in order to maintain their deceptive role for the workers, the upper leaders of the Social Democratic Party put on a farce of an "opposition party" in the "Bonn government."

    Comrade Lehmann repeatedly pointed out the broadness of the National Front. He said that the Communist Party must grasp different objects and use different propaganda and organizational forms to turn it into an organization that unites the vast majority of the people.

    At this time, the phone from the Central Committee of the Youth League rang again. A comrade came in and said, "The car is already parked at the door." Comrade Lehmann felt that the conversation was not finished and felt a little sorry. I said, "It doesn't matter, I can ask the comrades of the Secretariat of the National Committee of the National Front to continue talking about the questions later." We went out together.

    西德人民的斗争
    德意志民主共和国访问记之四
    吴文焘
    在柏林举行的全德青年和平大会，使我有机会和从西德来的很多青年、工人及其他各界人士接触，另外我还找到机会和德国共产党主席雷曼谈过一次话，使我了解了西德人民为保卫和平、争取民主统一的斗争情况。
    很多西德人告诉我：美英帝国主义的分裂德国、将西德变为侵略战争基地的一切罪行，在很长一个时期中并不为广大群众所认识，甚至在两年以前，很多人对“马歇尔计划”存过幻想，以为它能够提高人民的生活水平。多年来纳粹和战后美国法西斯的反动宣传，使他们不了解苏联，也不了解苏联对德国的政策。
    想想看：西德的公共机关中，平均百分之八十是过去的纳粹人物，司法部门的纳粹分子占百分之九十，教员、报纸编辑……大多数也是法西斯党徒。希特勒的冲锋队的军官们，又穿上了华盛顿、伦敦所发给他们的“警察”服装而招摇过市了。在阿登纳傀儡政府的周围，聚集着财阀、大地主和军国主义的势力。他们在帝国主义国家“最高专员”的控制下，充当着华尔街的忠实代理人。
    但是，“马歇尔计划”所给予西德人民的灾难日益深重显著，尤其表现在严重的失业问题上。据西德官方的估计，到一九五一年，西德失业的人数将超过四百万。这种饥饿和失业的威胁，使西德的广大人民具体认识了美英帝国主义者的罪恶。一个从美占区巴伐利亚来的三十二岁的失业工人尤利斯·巴烈赫对我说：“我们工人看清了：‘马歇尔计划’不是你需要什么给什么，而什么过剩了给什么。比如汽油、纺织品、肥皂、纸烟，西德都能制造，但市场上却只有美英货。德国的厂呢？或者禁止生产，或者将厂拆除。我就是这样失业的。甚至在‘马歇尔计划’下从荷兰输入的青菜，都比西德生产的便宜，而使种菜的农民无法维持。”
    我觉得工人巴烈赫的话虽然简单，却道出了“马歇尔计划”的实质。
    在战后五年的今天，从波兰、捷克等地迁回西德的农民，大多数仍然住在帐棚里，靠每星期领十几个马克的“救济金”来维持生活。阿登纳傀儡政府拒绝实行土地改革，而且加紧向这些没有土地的农民叫嚣：只有打回“奥得河——尼斯河边界”以东去，才是出路！
    在柏林德意志民主共和国全国阵线全国委员会的小礼堂里，我会到了一个从西德来观光的鲁尔区各界代表团。那天，总理格罗提渥和副总理乌布利希约定和他们举行一次座谈会。代表团有二十二个人，其中有工人、工程师、小工厂主和商人。从他们的发言中，我了解他们有着不同的认识和党派关系。
    但他们一致的问题是：“民主共和国政府如何使德国走上民主统一的道路？”“怎样开展东西德的贸易关系？”“民主共和国能否帮助解决西德工商界的困难？”等。我注意到：乌布利希对第三个问题作了极肯定的回答，并且说：“德意志民主共和国的生产品可以一直卖到北京，西德的工商业者只要拿出货单，我们可代为交易。”代表团听到这些话，掌声显得特别有劲。坐在我旁边的一个索林根城的小钢铁厂主对我诉说关于美英当局限制钢向东德出口，因而使得生意不佳的情况。我要求同他详细谈谈，并打听他叫什么名字，他惶恐不安地摆手说：“千万，千万不能发表我的姓名！他们（指占领当局）知道了可不得了！”
    已是五月的末尾了，听说雷曼同志就要离开柏林回西德去，我赶忙经过宣传局和他约定谈谈西德的情况。
    早晨准九点钟，我到了他的寓所，他正在一张靠背椅上休息。那天清早七点钟，他曾到东柏林郊外的一个儿童团露营地去参观一万多孩子们的生活。孩子们在大门口一见了他，就蜂拥地围上来，握手的，摸衣服的，献花的，挤不到跟前来的就拚命挤，呐喊，那条通往孩子们宿营帐棚的路上，一时水泄不通。大些的孩子们已经会照像了，就爬到树上去拍照。足足一个钟头，他才逐渐分开这些顽皮的孩子们到帐棚、儿童邮局、儿童俱乐部流览了一遍。现在，他刚刚回到寓所。
    他问我要谈些什么问题，我提出了几个范围。他一面把它记下来，一面似乎在考虑。这时我注意到他那神采奕奕、结实而闪着赤铜色光彩的面孔，立刻联想到他早年矿工的生活。他和台尔曼、皮克等同志都是“斯巴达团”的成员，是德国共产党的创始人之一。纳粹上台后，他转入地下工作，到一九三九年被投入集中营，直到红军到达，才从沙享豪逊集中营被解放出来。大概是受牢狱生活长久地折磨的原故，虽然只有五十一岁，他的背微微有些驼了，头发也已经灰白了。
    他从波茨坦协定谈起：“美英等帝国主义者从来就没有想实行波茨坦协定。”
    我们的谈话转入“马歇尔计划”及“舒曼计划”。他说：马歇尔计划的灾难已日益严重地加在西德人民的身上，同时，也日益为广大群众所清楚地认识了。
    这时有人给他打电话，从各地来到柏林的几十万青年要回去了，等着他讲话。
    雷曼同志放下电话，继续讲西德人民为保卫和平、要求在民主基础上的民族统一、撤去外国占领军、争取早日签订和约的斗争情况。西德各地无数保卫和平委员会和全国阵线委员会友好组的建立，工人的拒运军火，军火工厂的罢工，以及反对“拆厂”的斗争，证明反对美英占领及分裂德国将其殖民地化及作为侵略战争基地的阴谋，是绝大多数人民的共同意志。
    为了实现上述的目标，德国共产党及西德工人阶级的任务是异常重大的。为了分裂德国的民族统一，帝国主义者企图通过其爪牙舒马赫的社会民主党上层反动领导者分裂工人阶级的团结。舒马赫和阿登纳集团都是美英帝国主义的忠实走狗；但为了保持其对工人的欺骗作用，社会民主党上层领导者就在“波恩政府”中表演出一种“反对派”的滑稽剧。
    雷曼同志再三指出全国阵线的广泛性。他说共产党必须抓紧不同的对象、用不同的宣传组织形式来把它变成团结绝大多数人民的组织。
    这时，青年联盟中央的电话又来催了。外面进来一个同志说：“汽车已经停在门口了”。雷曼同志觉得没谈完，有些过意不去。我说：“不要紧，后面的问题我可以找全国阵线全国委员会秘书处的同志接着谈。”我们就一同出去了。
