    时事宣传·示威游行·生产竞赛  西南中小城市展开抗美援朝运动
    【新华社重庆十八日电】抗美援朝保家卫国运动已在西南区中小城市蓬勃展开。
    贵州遵义县城曾于十二月二日举行抗美援朝的万人示威游行。川东江津、川南宜宾、内江和川北蓬溪、仪陇等城镇，也都举行了几千人到两万多人的游行示威。
    各地人民团体都成立了抗美援朝宣传委员会，组织文教工作者和学生们用化装表演、访问、座谈会和闲谈的方式，深入农村进行时事宣传。有的学校还举办“屋顶广播”，向居民讲解国内外形势。
    各地工厂的工人们展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛。川南自贡市盐场各井灶产量较十一月份已增加了百分之十。某修械所在劳动模范刘子栋的带头努力下，半个月中使生产率提高了一倍以上。川东万县发电厂职工将十二月份订为“爱国主义生产运动月”。西康省运输公司工人表示决以做好运输工作，支援进军西藏的人民解放军来保家卫国。
