    Farmers in Various Parts of Hebei Province
    Organize Grain Protection Teams to Prevent Sabotage
    [This newspaper's report] After farmers in Hebei Province handed over their grain to the requisition committee, in order to prevent sabotage by special agents, farmers in many areas raised the slogan: "Guard it well, don't lose a single grain" and automatically established grain protection organizations. Farmers in Quanwang Village, Cang County, organized two grain protection teams, one to guard all night and the other to protect transportation, safely delivering the public grain to the warehouse. After the public grain was collected in Gu Mazhuang Village, Jiaocheng County, the county's warehouse was not yet repaired and could not be sent. Li Defu, a farmer in his sixties, automatically guarded with the financial and grain cadres for six consecutive days without sleeping. He said, "This is the country's grain, and we can't let bad people spoil it!" Liu Jiang, a farmer in Changdian, Zhuoxian County, did not leave the public grain day or night, and he was relieved only after all of it was sent away. Farmers in Shili Pu Village, Tong County, and other villages also automatically organized security groups to protect the safety of public grain.

    河北省各地农民  
    组织护粮班防止破坏
    【本报讯】河北省农民把粮食缴到征收委员会后，为了防止特务分子破坏，不少地区农民提出：“好好看守，不损失一粒粮”的口号，自动建立起护粮组织。沧县权王庄农民组织了两个护粮班，一班整夜看守，一班保护运送，把公粮安全地送到仓库里。交河县顾马庄公粮征齐后，县的仓库还没修好，不能送，六十多岁的农民李德福自动和财粮干部看守，一连六天没睡觉。他说：“这是国家的粮食，可一点也不能叫坏人糟踏啊！”涿县常店农民刘江，黑夜白天都不离开公粮，全部送走了之后，他才放了心。通县十里铺等村农民，也都自动组织了保卫组，保护公粮安全。
