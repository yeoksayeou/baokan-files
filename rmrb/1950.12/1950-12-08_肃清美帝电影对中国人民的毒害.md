Eradicating the Poisonous Effects of American Movies on the Chinese People

Movies are one of the most insidious tools of American imperialism for its "bloodless" aggression against the world's people, a fact that has been clearly demonstrated since American movies were introduced into China. Wall Street capitalists, through their eight major film companies, used this sharp knife to extract massive amounts of wealth from the Chinese people while simultaneously spreading a large number of ideological toxins, capturing the minds of some. Today, the Chinese people are erupting in demands for a reckoning from all over the country regarding this invisible crime of aggression.

American films, like other commodities, arrived in China with gunboats and cannons. In 1899, American imperialism intensified its aggression against China, proposing the "Open Door" policy and then participating in the Eight-Nation Alliance to attack China and suppress the anti-imperialist "Boxer Rebellion." After that, American imperialism became even more rampant in China. In 1904, Remas brought a projector and several films to Shanghai, immediately becoming rich and returning home fully loaded. In 1909, Brasch established a production organization in Shanghai and, taking advantage of its control over customs and other privileges, set up film distribution companies in various places. In 1920, American businessmen and Chinese comprador capitalists opened the Great Wall Film Company, which not only had a studio in Shanghai but also conducted surveys deep into the Chinese interior to prepare for military aggression. American films thus began to invade China.

As a result of the concentration and monopolization of capitalist production, the eight major American film companies defeated smaller American film companies and other British, French, and other imperialist film companies in China, seizing the Chinese market. They successively established general companies in Shanghai and branch companies in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hankou, and other places, deeply controlling the Chinese film market.

China's national film industry suffered from the beginning due to the destruction by the American imperialists, and for a long time stagnated at the handicraft stage. The big cities were controlled by American films, and almost all of them showed imperialist films. Taking Shanghai in 1934 as an example, imperialist films accounted for 93 percent of the films shown. Until April 1949, on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, imperialist films still accounted for 65.41 percent. As a result, Chinese-made films could only develop in small and medium-sized cities for the past two or three decades. But the American imperialists chased after them to small and medium-sized cities, dumping broken copies at cheap package rentals, forcing more than thirty private film companies in China to a dead end. At the same time, the Kuomintang reactionary regime colluded with the American imperialists to suppress relatively progressive Chinese films by means of censorship, deletion, bans, and arrests. Therefore, China's national film industry had been tragically unable to raise its head until the great victory of the people's revolution last year.

While undermining China's national film industry, the American imperialists also attempted to exclusively occupy and monopolize Chinese cinemas. The film contracts signed by the eight major film companies with the cinemas were extremely harsh. Several cinema managers in Beijing and Tianjin talked about the past with gnashing teeth, believing that the contracts signed with the American film companies were like indentures, and almost all the profits were squeezed out by the American capitalists. The contract terms increased from the initial eight to more than 130 later. The rent was based on a percentage of ticket sales, initially 30 percent, but later the highest was as much as 60 percent of the income handed over to the American capitalists. The contract was signed for at least one year, during which time no other films were allowed to be shown without permission, especially Chinese films. If the film was damaged, compensation had to be paid, and the damage list issued by the film company was the "only criterion," and Chinese cinemas had "no right to protest." If a cinema violated the contract, the "Film Merchants Association" organized by the eight major film companies would come forward to warn it jointly, or even jointly stop supplying films. In this way, Chinese cinemas had to "bow their heads." If they dared to resist, there were even more severe ways to deal with them. Yang Yizhi, the manager of the Da Guangming Cinema in Beijing, was questioned by the American deputy consul stationed in Peiping and warned by the Kuomintang reactionary government's police bureau before liberation. Not only that, the eight major film companies also bought and opened cinemas in various places, specializing in American films, so that not a single penny of profit would flow out. In 1948, they even planned to squeeze out all the Chinese cinemas. At that time, there were about 350 cinemas in the country, and they planned to bring 300 mobile cinemas from the United States, which could be opened immediately as long as the foundation was laid in China. Screens, machines, chairs, tickets, pencils, curtains, etc., had all been fully equipped in the United States. But due to the victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War, their dreams were shattered.

How much money did American imperialism extract from the Chinese film market in total? This is an account that is not easy to clear. Just in the five years from the Japanese surrender to the liberation of Shanghai, according to incomplete statistics from the Western Film Joint Committee of the Shanghai Film and Drama Industry Union's Distribution Branch, the eight major film companies imported 1,896 films into China from Shanghai. Averaging 30,000 US dollars extracted per film (many were more than this), a total of more than 56.6 million US dollars was extracted, equivalent to more than 168 billion RMB. This huge sum of money, if calculated at our production cost of 600 million per film, could produce more than 2,800 films. If calculated at an annual output of 140 films, it would be enough for us to use for 20 years. According to statistics from the Beijing-Tianjin cinema industry and some former Western film workers, in 1947 alone, American imperialism extracted more than 2.6 million US dollars in film rental fees from first-run cinemas in seven cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang. American films extract even more money from the people of the world. According to American magazine statistics, they extracted 300 million US dollars in 1946 alone. The film "Gone with the Wind" extracted more than 32 million US dollars.

What kind of ideological poison did American films inflict on the people? Ehrenburg said, "Hollywood movies are less an art and more a spreading plague bacillus." The eight major film companies are factories for manufacturing toxins. They are ordered by Wall Street capitalists to carry out all kinds of shameless deceptions, anesthetics, and intimidation in order to save the inevitable death of capitalism. They promote the so-called American way of life, paralyze the class consciousness of workers, cover up the facts of people eating people, and slander the Communist Party and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Through films such as "Wilson," the Democratic and Republican parties are portrayed as playing the game of being in and out of office, depicting a democratic style in which people can freely elect; "Penny Serenade" attempts to viciously instill the idea of class compromise and harmony, fabricating unrealistic love stories that distort the image of a father who insists on the interests of the working class as stubborn and unyielding, and portraying a daughter who betrays her class by flattering the factory owner's son as gentle and beautiful. As a result, the father dies, and the daughter marries the boss's son. "The Iron Curtain," "The Red Menace," and "I Married a Communist" are all films that slander the Communist Party. As David Platt, a reporter for the New York Worker Daily, said, "The worship of brutality has reached its logical apex. The effect of this kind of film is to erode a person's feelings for peace and democratic progress." "Battleground," "They Were Expendable" portrays Native Americans as extremely barbaric and ignorant, "The Desert Song," "The Desert Rats" insists that Americans led the Moroccan people to fight against the British, and American officers discovered and extinguished Hitler's Nazi activities, leading people to believe that the United States is benevolent and supreme, and the people of the colonies are backward and foolish and should be ruled by the American imperialists. Many films depicting the Chinese people always show them hunched over, smoking opium, with bound feet, and pulling rickshaws. This slander has long aroused the unparalleled anger of the Chinese people. Films such as "Bathing Beauty" and "The Ziegfeld Follies" are another of the most commonly used methods of Wall Street capitalists, using erotic song and dance, fantastic adventures, and killings and robberies to make people's vision blurred in the American gold dollar rule, unable to find out who the real enemy is. But with the expansion of its economy, American imperialism is not satisfied with the above-mentioned deceptions, so it has produced a large number of films calling for war, attempting to drive the American people to die for the Wall Street capitalists, and vainly trying to scare the people of various countries into bowing their heads to the American imperialists. "So Proudly We Hail!", "Cry 'Havoc'" does not dare to mention why the war is being fought, but deceives the American people by saying that war is not boring, and there are women, songs, dances, and wine; "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," "Suicide Squadron," "Across the Pacific," "World War II," and "The Beginning or the End" promote the power of the atomic bomb and the theory of weapons alone, obliterating historical facts and attributing the victory of the war against Japan to the two atomic bombs of the American imperialists. The main factor that really determined Japan's defeat was the Soviet Red Army's annihilation of the Japanese Kwantung Army, but not a word is mentioned in these films. It is with such ghostly tricks that American imperialism, in collusion with the Kuomintang reactionary rule, has injected the ideological toxins of worshiping and fearing the United States into the minds of some Chinese people.

The brilliance of the Communist Party has illuminated the people of the whole country, and the movement to resist America and aid Korea has further enhanced the people's understanding of American imperialism. Today is the time to thoroughly eradicate the ideological toxins of American movies.

Zhai Wanli, a 22-year-old college student in Shanghai, had a fondness for American movies since he was a child. He had seen "Flying Tigers" and "China Forever," and he mistakenly regarded American imperialism as China's sincere friend. He had seen "The Ziegfeld Follies" and "The Gold Diggers of 1933" and thought that the United States was a paradise on earth. He had seen "Jesse James" and worshiped the "heroism" of the great thief Jesse James. When he was short of money, he thought of a set of movies, posing as a pseudo-soldier, writing bad checks, blackmailing and deceiving, and even using sleeping pills to rape his girlfriend. After the liberation of Shanghai, he still did not wake up from his sins and even committed armed robbery. After being reformed in prison, he understood and accused: "American movies have harmed me and many others. American imperialism is our deadly enemy!" Now many cinema employees are automatically stopping the showing of American films. Beijing stopped showing them as early as February this year when the American imperialists bombed Shanghai. Tianjin also followed suit. Recently, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places have also stopped showing them. Driving American films out of the Chinese market, not allowing American imperialism to spread ideological toxins again, and eradicating the enemies in our minds is a task as important as eliminating the tangible aggression of American imperialism on the battlefield.

    肃清美帝电影对中国人民的毒害
    电影是美帝国主义侵略世界人民“杀人不见血”的最恶毒的工具之一，自从美帝电影输入中国以来就清清楚楚地说明了这个事实。华尔街资本家的八大影片公司运用这把尖刀，从中国人民身上榨走了大量膏血，同时又散布了大量思想毒菌，一部分人民在思想上被美帝俘虏。今天，中国人民对于这笔无形的侵略罪行，从全国各地爆发了要求清算的吼声。
    美帝影片正和其他商品一样，是随着军舰大炮来到中国的。一八九九年，美帝加紧对中国的侵略，提出“门户开放”政策，接着，参加八国联军进攻中国，镇压“义和团”反帝运动。之后，美帝更进一步横行中国。一九○四年，雷马斯带着一架放映机和几部片子到了上海，一下子就腰缠万贯满载而归。一九○九年布拉斯奇在上海开设制片机构，并利用控制海关等特权在各地设立影片代理公司。一九二○年，美商和中国买办阶级开设长城画片公司，不仅在上海有摄影场，而且深入中国内地勘察，作军事侵略的准备。美帝影片就这样开始侵入中国。
    由于大并小的资本主义生产集中垄断的结果，美帝八大影片公司打垮了美帝较小的影片公司和其他英、法等帝国主义在中国的影片公司，霸占了中国市场，先后在上海设总公司，在天津、广州、重庆、汉口等地设分公司，深入控制中国电影市场。
    中国的民族电影事业从出生就遭受美帝的摧残，长期地停滞在手工业状态。大城市被美帝影片控制，几乎全部是演帝国主义片子，以一九三四年上海一地为例，在所演的影片中，帝国主义片子占百分之九十三，直到一九四九年四月上海解放前夕，帝国主义影片还占百分之六十五·四一。因之，二、三十年来中国人制作的影片只得向中小城市发展，但美帝又追赶到中小城市，把破烂拷贝廉价包租倾销，弄得中国三十几家私营影片公司被逼得走头无路，同时再加上国民党反动政权和美帝勾结起来用检查、删剪、禁演、逮捕的手段压抑中国比较进步的影片。于是中国民族电影事业在去年人民革命取得伟大胜利之前，一直是悲惨地抬不起头来。
    与摧残中国民族电影事业的同时，美帝还企图独占、垄断中国的电影院。八大影片公司和电影院订立的映片合同，条款严苛得无以复加，京津几家映过美片的影院经理谈起往事切齿痛恨，认为与美帝影片公司订的合同有如卖身契，映出的利润几乎全被美国资本家榨光了，合同条文由最初的八条，增加到后来的一百三十多条。租金按票款收入提成，最初是百分之三十，后来最高的要把百分之六十的收入拱手送给美国资本家。合同一订就至少一年，在这期间非经许可不准演别家片子，特别是不准演中国片子；影片如有损毁必须赔偿，还要以影片公司所开具的损失单为“唯一准则”，中国影院“无权抗争”。那家影院违背了合同，就由八大影片公司所组织的“片商联合会”出面共同警告，甚至联合停止供给影片。这样，中国影院就不能不“俯首贴耳”，如果敢于抗争的话，就还有更厉害的办法对付。北京大光明影院的经理杨宜之，就曾在解放前遭到美帝驻平副领事的质问和国民党反动政府警察局的警告。不仅如此，八大影片公司还在各地收买、开设电影院，专演美帝影片，使利润一分一毫也流不出去。一九四八年，他们还计划干脆挤垮所有的中国电影院，当时全国共约有三百五十所电影院，他们打算从美国搬来三百所活动电影院，只要在中国找好地基，立即就可以开演。银幕、机器、椅子、门票以及铅笔，窗帘等等都已在美国装备齐全。但由于中国人民解放战争的胜利发展，他们的梦想才被粉碎了。
    美帝国主义从中国电影院市场上一共榨走了多少钱呢？这是一个不容易算清的帐。单就日本投降后到上海解放之前的五年间，据上海影剧业工会发行分会西片联合委员会不完全的统计，八大影片公司从上海输入中国的影片达一千八百九十六部，平均每部以榨取三万美金（多者不止此数）计，共榨取了五千六百余万美元，合人民币一万六千八百多亿，这笔巨大数字的款项，如以我们每部制片六亿元成本计算，可以制二千八百多部片子，如每年以一百四十部的产量计算，可够我们用二十年。又据京津电影院业和过去一部分西片工作者统计，一九四七年美帝单在北京、天津、沈阳等七个城市中头轮影院榨取的影片租金就达二百六十多万美元。美帝电影榨取全世界人民的钱，数字更为巨大，据美国杂志统计，一九四六年全年就榨取了三十万万美元。《乱世佳人》一部片子榨取了三千二百多万美元。
    美帝影片所加于人民的思想毒害都是些什么呢？爱伦堡说：“好莱坞的电影与其说是一种艺术，不如说是蔓延的鼠疫菌。”八大影片公司即是毒菌制造所，它受命于华尔街资本家，为了挽救资本主义必然死亡的命运，进行种种无耻的欺骗、麻醉、恐吓。它宣扬所谓美国生活方式，麻痹工人的阶级意识，掩盖人吃人的事实，诬蔑共产党和苏联、人民民主国家。通过《威尔逊总统传》之类的片子，把民主与共和两党装做在野与在朝的把戏，描写为人民可以自由选举的民主作风；“空谷芳草”妄想狠毒的灌注阶级妥协调和的思想，捏造超阶级超现实的恋爱故事，歪曲的把一个坚持工人阶级利益的父亲污辱为顽固不化，把一个向工厂老板的少爷献媚背叛自己阶级的女儿，写成温柔美丽的性格，结果父亲因此身亡，而女儿和老板少爷结了婚；《铁幕》、《红色的威胁》、《我和一个共产党员结婚》等，都是诬蔑共产党的影片。这些片子，如纽约工人日报记者大卫·勃拉特所说：“对于残暴的崇拜已达到了逻辑的顶点，这种影片的效果是要消蚀一个人对于和平与民主进步的情感”；《战地鸳鸯》、《马革裹尸》把印第安人写成极端野蛮无知，《沙漠情歌》、《阿拉伯风雨》硬说美国人领导摩洛哥人民反英，美国军官发觉、扑灭了希特勒纳粹活动，叫人相信美国仁慈，至高无上，殖民地人民落后愚蠢，应该受美帝统治；许多描写中国人民的片子，一出现在镜头上就是佝偻着腰，吸大烟，缠小脚，拉黄包车，这种诽谤早已引起中国人民无比的愤怒。《出水芙蓉》《花花世界》之类的片子，则是华尔街资本家另一种最惯用的手法，用艳情歌舞、神怪探险、厮杀劫盗使人民在美帝金元统治中视线缭乱，找不到真正的敌人是谁。但是美帝随着经济的扩张，对上述的种种欺骗犹不满足，于是制造了大批叫嚣战争的片子，企图驱使美国人民为华尔街资本家送死，妄想吓唬各国人民向美帝低头。《战斗夫人》、《红粉军人》不敢提战争是为什么，而欺骗美国人民说战争既不枯燥，又有女人，有歌有舞有酒；《东京上空三十秒》、《海底肉弹》、《横渡太平洋》、《第二次世界大战》、《原子弹秘密》等，宣扬原子弹威力和唯武器论，抹煞历史事实，把对日战争的胜利归功于美帝的两颗原子弹；真正决定战败日本的主要因素是苏联红军歼灭日本关东军，却在这些影片上一字不提。美帝就是凭着这样鬼蜮的伎俩，在和国民党反动派统治勾结下，把崇美、恐美的思想毒素注入了一部分中国人民的脑海里。
    共产党的光辉照亮了全国人民，抗美援朝运动更提高了全国人民对美帝的认识，今天是彻底肃清美帝电影的思想毒菌的时候了。
    上海的一个二十二岁的大学生翟万里，从小以美帝电影为癖好，他看过《飞虎队》、《中华万岁》，他错把美帝当做中国真诚的朋友；他看过《花花世界》、《金玉满堂》认为美国是人间天堂极乐世界；他看过《荡寇志》崇拜大盗杰赛琪姆士的“英雄气概”；当他没钱的时候，他就想起电影中的一套，冒充伪军人，开空头支票，敲诈欺骗，以至放迷药强奸女友。上海解放后，他仍然没有从罪恶中觉悟，竟至持枪行抢；经过在监狱中的改造，他明白了，他控诉说：“美国电影害了我，也害了很多人，美帝国主义是我们的死敌！”现在许许多多的电影院从业员自动停止映演美帝片子，北京早自今年二月美帝轰炸上海起就停演了。天津也继之停演。最近上海、广州等地也已停演。把美帝影片赶出中国市场，不许美帝再散布思想毒菌，肃清思想中的敌人，和在战场上消灭美帝有形侵略是同样重要的工作。
