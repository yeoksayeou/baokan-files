Local Industrialists and Businessmen Pay Taxes to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    Tianjin
    After the demonstration and parade, Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles enthusiastically paid their industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1950 with high patriotic zeal. When the tax collection was arranged on November 25th, all industries enthusiastically launched a campaign to report and pay taxes early. The declaration and evaluation procedures were completed in just half a month. The tax payment date was originally scheduled to start on the 16th of this month, but in fact, many industries concentrated their tax payments to industry associations or deposited them in banks before the scheduled date, so as to pay them collectively on time. On the 17th, nine industries including paper making, toothbrush, and bicycle industries made collective tax payments. By the deadline of the 25th of this month, the number of taxpayers had reached more than 90% of the total number of taxpayers.
    Beijing
    The industrialists and businessmen in the capital are practicing the promise of not owing taxes, not evading taxes, and not delaying payments in the patriotic convention with high patriotic enthusiasm, so as to assist the government in completing the tax revenue task. For example, Deshunxing, Zhonghefu, Tongrenhe, and Qitaiyong and other households in the Industrial and Commercial Tax Assessment Committee of Dongzhimenwai Avenue received the tax payment notice for November business tax on the 14th of this month, and all paid the tax into the treasury on the 16th, and issued a challenge to the city's industrial and commercial households. For another example, some industrial and commercial groups in the second and third sub-bureaus of the tax bureau have established "mutual aid conventions" to ensure that there will be no more tax arrears. They also want to make truthful declarations and not evade taxes. The eighth sub-bureau has launched a wave of collective tax payments. For example, team leader Wan Baoquan, in order to complete the collective tax payment, braved the wind and cold to urge payment from each household. Team leader Dexingxiang Tea House once paid 7 million yuan for small households.
    Nanjing
    When industrialists and businessmen in Nanjing prepaid their business tax for November, there were only 574 households by December 15th. After denouncing the crimes of U.S. imperialism, they developed their patriotism and, by the 20th, the number of households had surged to nearly 5,000.
    Hangzhou
    Since the beginning of the movement to clear up tax arrears in Hangzhou on the first of this month, more than 60% of the tax arrears have been paid into the treasury by the 15th, thanks to the enthusiastic payment of tax arrears by various tax-owing households.
    Qingdao
    The work of putting the winter industrial and commercial tax of Qingdao's industrial and commercial circles, calculated according to turnover, into the treasury was basically completed in the ten days after December 5th. Generally, industrial and commercial households can report and pay quickly; and many households pay in advance. The deputy manager of Jinlong Commercial Firm in the hardware industry, after understanding the true meaning of paying taxes to protect the country and defend the home, voluntarily confessed to concealing 70 million yuan in undeclared summer turnover; in addition, he personally mobilized 50 households to make supplementary declarations of 330.13 million yuan in summer turnover. Now, on the basis of the improved ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen in the city, all industries have launched a patriotic competition movement for truthful reporting and quick payment.
    Chongqing
    Among the industrial and commercial households in Chongqing, more than 70 larger industries such as mountain products and medicinal materials, pigments, and finance have held anti-U.S. aggression and aid-Korea symposiums. At the meetings, representatives of various industries guaranteed that they would pay the taxes due as soon as possible, and pay this year's taxes this year. As of now, more than 90% of the medicinal materials industry has paid the winter industrial and commercial tax, and the mountain products, pigments, salt transport, and finance industries are also actively striving to pay into the treasury as soon as possible. On December 18th alone, more than 2,000 households in the first sub-bureau of the Municipal Tax Bureau paid various taxes.
    Chahar Province
    In order to fulfill their patriotic conventions, industrialists and businessmen in various small and medium-sized cities in Chahar Province launched patriotic competitions to clear up tax arrears and pay the industrial and commercial tax for the fourth quarter. By the 15th, industrial and commercial circles in Zhangjiakou had paid off all the 440,000 jin of millet in arrears for the first, second, and third quarters of this year; the industrial and commercial tax for the first two months of the fourth quarter has also been basically paid off. The collection of the December industrial and commercial tax is scheduled to begin in the latter half of the month, and the industrial and commercial circles have expressed that they will strive to pay quickly. The tax arrears for the first three quarters of this year in Xuanhua City were cleared as early as November 25th, and the industrial and commercial tax for November was fully paid within the first four days of this month. Industrial and commercial circles in other small cities throughout the province have also spontaneously launched patriotic competitions to pay taxes early. Yanggao County originally scheduled to collect the fourth quarter industrial and commercial tax from December 9th to 15th, but inspired by the enthusiasm of the patriotic competition, the industrial and commercial circles requested to start the collection three days earlier. The People's Government agreed to this request, so it was fully completed by the morning of the 9th. The collection of the fourth quarter industrial and commercial tax in larger county towns such as Huailai, Yingxian, Hunyuan, and Huairen were also completed before December 15th.
    Southern Jiangsu
    Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Kunshan, Songjiang and other cities launched a tax arrears clearing competition at the beginning of December. As of the 15th, more than 6,000 households in Suzhou have paid 500 million yuan in tax arrears. Songjiang completed 80% of the tax arrears clearing in 20 days.
    Northern Jiangsu
    Yangzhou and Nantong cities have collected 95% of the summer business tax into the treasury. The business tax for September to November in Yangzhou has not yet been officially collected, and the prepaid tax from industrial and commercial circles has reached one-third of the amount to be collected by the 12th of this month.

    各地工商业者以缴清税款抗美援朝
    天津
    天津工商界在示威大游行后，即以高度爱国热忱踊跃缴纳一九五○年下半年度工商业税。这次税收在十一月二十五日开始布置时，各行业即热烈展开实报早缴运动，仅仅半月便完成了全部申报、评议手续。纳库日期原订本月十六日开始，但实际上许多行业还在规定的日期之前即把税款集中到同业公会或存入银行，以便按时集体入库。到十七日集体纳库者即有造纸、牙刷、自行车等九个行业。至本月二十五日届满限期时，纳税户已达总纳税户数的百分之九十以上。
    北京
    首都工商业者正以高度的爱国热情，实践着爱国公约中不欠税、不逃税、不滞纳的约言，协助政府完成税收任务。如东直门外大街工商业税评委会中德顺兴、中和福、同仁合、启泰永等户于本月十四日接到十一月份营业税缴款通知书，十六日就全部纳了库，并向全市工商业户提出了挑战书。又如税务第二、三分局辖区内有些工商小组，建立了“互助公约”，保证不再有滞纳税款的现象。并要真实申报、不逃税。第八分局，更掀起了集体纳税的热潮。如小组长万宝泉，为了完成集体纳库，冒着风寒，到各户去催缴。小组长德兴祥茶庄，一次替小户垫款七十万元。
    南京
    南京工商业家在预缴十一月份营业税款时，到十二月十五日，只有五百七十四户，经过控诉美帝罪行后，发扬了爱国主义精神，到二十日止，即激增到接近五千户。
  杭州
    杭市工商界于本月一日展开肃清欠税运动后，由于各欠税户的踊跃缴纳，截至十五日止，已有百分之六十以上的欠税缴纳入库。
    青岛
    青岛市工商业界的冬季工商业税按营业额计算部分入库工作，从十二月五日以后的十天中，即已基本结束。一般工商业户均能实报、快交；并有不少户提前入库。五金业锦隆商行副经理在明白了纳税是为了保家卫国的真实意义后，自动坦白出匿报夏季营业额七千万元；此外还亲自动员五十户补报夏季营业额三亿三千零十三万元。现该市在工商业者思想认识提高的基础上，各行业展开了实报快交的爱国竞赛运动。
    重庆
    重庆市工商业户中，山货药材、颜料、金融等七十几个较大行业都先后举行了抗美援朝座谈会，会上各行业代表纷纷保证，要尽速缴清应纳税款，今年税款今年缴清。截至目前为止，药材业百分之九十以上已缴清冬季工商业税，山货、颜料、盐运、金融等行业也正积极争取早日纳库。十二月十八日一天，仅市税局第一分局辖区内缴纳各种税款者即达二千户以上。
    察哈尔省
    察哈尔省各中小城市工商界为履行爱国公约，相互发起清缴欠税和缴纳第四季度工商业税的爱国竞赛。至十五日止，张家口工商界已将今年一、二、三季的工商业税尾欠四十四万斤小米扫数缴清；第四季中前两月的工商业税也已基本上缴完。十二月份工商业税收定下旬开征，工商界均表示要争取快缴。宣化市今年前三季工商业税尾欠早在十一月二十五日即清理完毕，十一月份工商业税在本月初四天内即全部缴齐。全省其他小城市工商界也都自动发起提早纳税的爱国竞赛运动。阳高县原定十二月九日至十五日开征第四季度工商业税，但工商界在爱国竞赛热情的鼓舞下，纷纷请求早三日开征，人民政府答应了这一请求，因此到九日早晨即全部完成。怀来、应县、浑源、怀仁等较大县城第四季度工商业税的征收工作也都提前于十二月十五日前完成。
    苏南
    无锡、苏州、常州、昆山、松江等城市，分别于十二月初发起肃清欠税竞赛运动。截至十五日，苏州市六千多户已缴纳欠税五亿元。松江在清理欠税中，二十天完成了百分之八十。
