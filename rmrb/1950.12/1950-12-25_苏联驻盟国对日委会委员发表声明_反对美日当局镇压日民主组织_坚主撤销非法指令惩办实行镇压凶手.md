Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 24th: TASS reports from Tokyo: The Allied Council for Japan held a regular meeting on the 20th. Major General Kislenko, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan, issued a statement opposing the suppression measures taken by the US occupation authorities and the Japanese government against Japanese labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations.

The statement began by saying: The representatives of the Soviet Union to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan have repeatedly pointed out that the policy of deprivation and cancellation of the democratic rights and freedoms of the Japanese people, implemented by the US occupation authorities and the Japanese government, violates the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, signed by the United States, Britain, and China, and later joined by the Soviet Union, and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on the democratization of Japan. In a letter dated June 24th of this year, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan to the Supreme Commander (referring to MacArthur) listed numerous facts demonstrating that the US occupation authorities not only failed to take measures to stop the anti-democratic measures of the Japanese authorities, but on the contrary, they themselves were the direct encouragers and instigators of these measures. Recent facts show that the Japanese government, under the direct orders of the US occupation authorities, is implementing new police terror measures against democratic organizations, even using blatant means of violence without hesitation. At the same time, the US occupation authorities and the Japanese government are reviving and encouraging the activities of the notorious Japanese reactionary organizations and militarists who instigated and organized Japanese aggression.

The statement listed five categories of facts to illustrate the above situation:

(1) The President of the Japanese Ministry of Justice ordered the dissolution of the National Liaison Council of Trade Unions on August 30th of this year, and twelve leaders of this union were banned from engaging in political and public activities. The work of this large workers' organization aimed to defend the daily economic needs of the workers and fully complied with the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on the "Principles of Japanese Trade Union Organization" on December 6, 1946.

(2) After the Supreme Commander issued directives on June 26th and July 18th of this year to close the Japanese Communist Party newspaper "Akahata," the Japanese authorities began to implement large-scale police repression measures against many democratic newspapers. Today, more than 1,200 publications have been banned in Japan.

(3) The Japanese government continues to suppress labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations that defend the rights and interests of the broad masses of people. Encouraged by the US occupation authorities, it has begun to dismiss workers and other employees in large numbers from state-owned and private enterprises and institutions for their political beliefs. Progressive intellectuals in Japan are also being persecuted. According to newspaper reports, the Japanese government is drafting measures to dismiss professors and lecturers with progressive ideas from educational institutions. Students are being expelled from Japanese educational institutions for their political beliefs.

(4) With the apparent connivance of the US occupation authorities, Japanese police terror is increasing, and workers, students, and others participating in economic strikes, peaceful gatherings, and demonstrations are being continuously suppressed. For example, from September to November of this year, unemployed people in Tokyo's Shiba and Shinjuku wards demanding work, striking workers of the Fuji Company in Mitaka ward near Tokyo, students from five universities in the capital protesting the dismissal of progressive professors, workers at the "Electrification" electrical engine factory in Tokyo, and workers at the Yahata Iron Works in Kyushu were all subjected to repression and persecution by the Japanese police, and many were arrested or injured as a result.

(5) Under the instructions of the US occupation authorities, the Japanese government restored the political rights of more than 10,000 fascists on October 13th, who were previously officers of the Japanese regular army and navy, active leaders of militarist and fascist organizations, leaders of monopoly companies, and officials of the Japanese secret police ("Tokko"), etc.

The statement pointed out that the above facts prove that the US occupation authorities and the Japanese government continue to implement policies that violate the Potsdam Proclamation and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on the democratization and demilitarization of Japan.

The statement concluded: In view of this, I reiterate my firm demand for measures to terminate the violent and arbitrary actions against Japanese labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations mentioned in my letter of June 24th of this year. In addition, I firmly demand the following measures:

(1) The Japanese government immediately revoke the order dissolving the National Liaison Council of Trade Unions, rehire the dismissed personnel, and must not dismiss and persecute them again for their political beliefs.

(2) Immediately revoke the illegal directives issued by the Supreme Commander on June 26th and July 18th of this year regarding the closure of the Japanese Communist Party newspaper "Akahata," as well as all orders issued by the Japanese government based on his illegal directives prohibiting trade union publications and other democratic newspapers and persecuting the staff of these newspapers.

(3) Revoke the decision of the Japanese government on October 13th of this year to restore the political rights of those who were prohibited from participating in political activities in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and not allow the restoration of the political rights of such persons in the future without the formal decision of the Far Eastern Commission.

(4) Punish the murderers who carried out police repression and arrested people participating in gatherings and demonstrations, as well as trade union leaders and progressive people.

    苏联驻盟国对日委会委员发表声明
    反对美日当局镇压日民主组织
    坚主撤销非法指令惩办实行镇压凶手
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社东京讯：盟国对日委员会于二十日举行例会。盟国对日委员会的苏联委员基斯连科少将发表了反对美国占领当局和日本政府对日本工会、共产党和其他民主组织的镇压措施的声明。
    声明首称：苏联驻远东委员会和盟国对日委员会的代表们已一再指出：美国占领当局和日本政府实行的剥夺和取消日本人民的民主权利和自由的政策，违反了美、英和中国签字的、后来苏联也参加的一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告，和远东委员会关于日本民主化的决定。今年六月二十四日，盟国对日委员会的苏联委员致总司令（按指麦克阿瑟）的信件列举了许多事实，说明美国占领当局不仅没有采取措施制止日本当局的反民主措施，而且相反地，他们自己就是这些措施的直接鼓励者和发动者。最近的事实显示，日本政府在美国占领当局的直接命令下，正对民主组织实行新的警察恐怖措施，甚至毫不踌躇地使用公然的暴力手段。同时，美国占领当局和日本政府正复活并鼓励声名狼藉的、曾鼓动并组织日本侵略的日本反动组织和军国主义分子的活动。
    声明列举五类事实，说明上述情况：
    （一）日本法务府总裁在今年八月三十日下令解散全国工会联络协议会，这个工会的十二个领袖并被禁止进行政治的和公共的活动。而这个巨大的工人组织的工作，是旨在保卫工人的日常经济需要，完全符合一九四六年十二月六日远东委员会关于“日本工会组织原则”的决定。
    （二）在总司令于今年六月二十六日和七月十八日发布指令封闭日本共产党报纸《赤旗纸》以后，日本当局即开始对许多民主报纸实行大规模的警察镇压手段。今天在日本已被查禁的出版物达一千二百种以上。
    （三）日本政府继续对保卫广大阶层人民的权利和利益的工会、共产党及其他民主组织进行镇压。它在美国占领当局的鼓励下，开始从国营和私营的企业和机关中，为了政治信仰而大批解雇工人及其他雇员。日本进步知识分子也正在遭受迫害。据报纸消息，日本政府正在拟订措施，以便从教育机关中解聘有进步思想的教授和讲师。学生们为了政治信仰而被从日本的教育机关中开除出去。
    （四）在美国占领当局的显然纵容下，日本警察恐怖日益增加，对参加经济罢工、和平集会和示威的工人、学生及其他人们继续进行镇压。如今年九月至十一月间，东京芝区和新宿区要求工作的失业者、东京附近三鹰区富士公司罢工工人、首都五大学学生抗议解聘进步教授的集会、东京“电业化”的电气发动机工厂工人、九州的八幡制铁所工人，都遭到日本警察的镇压和迫害，很多人因而被捕或被击伤。
    （五）在美国占领当局的指示下，日本政府于十月十三日恢复了一万多法西斯分子的政治权利，这些人都是以前日本正规陆军和海军的军官、军国主义和法西斯组织的积极负责人、垄断公司的领袖、日本秘密警察（“特高”）的官员等。
    声明指出：上述事实，证明美国占领当局及日本政府继续执行与波茨坦公告和远东委员会关于使日本民主化和非军国主义化的决定相违背的政策。
    声明末称：有鉴于此，我再度坚主采取措施终止我在今年六月二十四日的信中述及的对日本工会、共产党及其他民主组织的暴力及专横的行动。此外，我坚主采取下列措施：
    （一）日本政府立即撤销解散全国工会联络协议会的命令，重新雇用被解雇的人员，并不得再因为政治信仰而加以解雇和迫害。
    （二）立即撤销总司令于今年六月二十六日和七月十八日发出的关于封闭日本共产党报纸《赤旗报》的非法指令，以及日本政府根据他的非法指令所发布的禁止工会出版物和其他民主报纸并且迫害这些报纸的职员的一切命令。
    （三）撤销日本政府今年十月十三日关于恢复依照波茨坦公告的规定和远东委员会的决定禁止参加政治活动者的政治权利的这项决定，并不许在将来不经远东委员会的正式决定就恢复这种人的政治权利。
    （四）惩办那些实行警察镇压和逮捕参加集会与示威的人们以及工会领袖、进步人士的凶手。
