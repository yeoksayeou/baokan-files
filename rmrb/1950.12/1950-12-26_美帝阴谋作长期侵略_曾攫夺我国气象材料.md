Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an article by Mao Changqing on December 13, exposing the US seizure of meteorological materials from our country. The article stated: During the Anti-Japanese War, US imperialism established the Fourteenth Air Force and simultaneously set up meteorological stations in China. This was the beginning of US imperialist meteorological aggression against China. In January 1947, the Confidential Document "Air Force Record Statistical Table Filing Instructions" compiled and printed by the Statistics Section of the Meteorological Office of the puppet Air Force Headquarters stipulated: "Meteorological statistical forms must be made in triplicate, one copy to be submitted to the Meteorological Corps (i.e., the Meteorological Corps of the puppet Air Force Headquarters), one copy to the US Department of the Army, and one copy to be kept on file." Notes 1 and 2 in the document further stipulated: (1) If wind measurement balloons are released in addition to radar wind measurements, then three additional copies of each type must be made. (2) If wind measurement balloons are not released at the same specified time, separate statistics must be made and three additional copies must be made. These temporary high-altitude materials were naturally also submitted to the United States. At the same time, some meteorological research institutions and universities in China repeatedly requested the same meteorological data from the puppet Air Force Headquarters, but were completely refused.

Within the notorious "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" (SACO), an meteorological personnel training class was attached, training a total of approximately 250 meteorological secret agents in Chongqing and Shanghai in five sessions from the winter of 1943 to July 1946. Hou Qigeng, who served as the captain of the second, third, and fourth sessions of the "SACO" meteorological personnel training class, said: "The vast majority of the students in the meteorological training class were telecommunications personnel who had undergone basic training organized by Dai Li." (Basic training took place in three locations: Xifeng in Guizhou, Jian'ou in Fujian, and Lanzhou in Gansu. The training subjects included many specialized techniques for killing and sabotage, such as grappling, narcotics, and establishing secret radio stations. The training period was one year.) During the Anti-Japanese War, the "SACO" established more than 40 meteorological stations in major cities and important airports across the country, and only withdrew from the mainland shortly before liberation.

Aviation, navigation, military affairs, agriculture, medicine, and other fields all need to use meteorology, which is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. What is the purpose of US imperialism's aggression against China's meteorological science? Mr. Lü Jiong, a researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Geophysics, said: "Although the weather in November this year may not be the same as the weather in November last year, the longer the record time, the closer the average state is to the truth. The US imperialist plunder of Chinese meteorological data is to serve as capital for long-term aggression against China."

    美帝阴谋作长期侵略
    曾攫夺我国气象材料
    【新华社讯】十二月十三日南京新华日报登载毛常青所写的文章，揭露了美国攫夺我国气象材料的情形。该文略称：抗日战争时期，美帝建立第十四航空队，同时在中国设立了气象站。这是美帝对中国气象侵略的开始。一九四七年一月，伪空军总司令部气象处统计科编印的密件“空军纪录统计表册填报须知”中规定：“气象统计表格须造三份，一份呈气象总队（按即伪空军总部气象总队），一份送美国陆军部，一份留底。”该文件内第一、二条附注中又规定：（一）除雷达测风外兼放测风气球，则每种各另造三份。（二）测风球不在同一规定时间施放，亦分别统计另造三份。这些临时性的高空材料，自然也一并呈送美国。与此同时，中国有些研究气象的机关和大学，曾三番五次地向伪空军总部要同样的气象资料，但是却被完全拒绝。
    在恶名昭彰的“中美合作所”里，附设了一个气象人员训练班，从一九四三年冬天到一九四六年七月，前后在重庆和上海训练了五期气象特务，共计二百五十人左右。曾在“中美合作所”气象人员训练班当过二、三、四期队长的侯启庚说：“气象训练班的学员，绝大部分是经过戴笠所办的基层训练的电讯人员。”（基层训练有三个地方：贵州息烽、福建建瓯、甘肃兰州，训练科目中包括许多杀人、破坏的专门技术，如擒拿法、迷魂药及建立秘密电台等，训练时间是一年。）“中美合作所”在抗战期间，在全国各大城市与重要机场设立了四十多个气象站，直到解放前不久才撤出大陆。
    航空、航海、军事、农业、医学等都需要运用气象，它与国计民生有着密切的关系。美帝侵略中国的气象科学作用何在呢？南京地球物理研究所研究员吕炯先生说：“虽然今年十一月的天气不见得和去年十一月的天气相同，但是纪录时间愈长，那么平均状态也就愈接近真实。美帝掠夺中国气象资料，是作为长期侵略中国的资本。”
