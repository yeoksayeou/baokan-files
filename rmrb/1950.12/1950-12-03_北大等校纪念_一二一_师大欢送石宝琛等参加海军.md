[Our Newspaper] The faculty and students of Normal University gathered in the auditorium on the 1st evening to commemorate the great festivals of the "December 1st" and "December 9th" epoch-making student movements, and to send off Shi Baozhen, Qi Jiying, Liu Shukai, and Wang Longbao, four students who gloriously joined the People's Navy. At the meeting, the principal of the school and the director of the Propaganda Department of the People's Navy Command both pointed out that in the high tide of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, commemorating these two festivals and the importance of young students participating in naval construction to defend the country had special significance. They also encouraged the students who joined the navy to continue their efforts in their new positions and become outstanding cadres of the Chinese People's Navy.

Amidst the students' loud singing and enthusiastic applause, the principal of the school presented the students joining the navy with glorious big red flowers. Representatives from the student union, labor union, and departments presented flowers and gifts. Qi Jiying, on behalf of the students joining the navy, gave a reply, saying, "We guarantee to complete our tasks under any difficult circumstances and defend the motherland with practical actions."

[Our Newspaper] Peking University did not hold a large commemorative meeting this year to commemorate "December 1st," and there were no striking big-character posters on Democracy Square. However, this does not mean that the faculty and students of Peking University have forgotten this tragic blood feud, but rather that they have transformed their full of grief and indignation into tangible strength, commemorating this day with practical actions to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

At 6:30 in the evening, the Peking University New Literature Society held a simple and solemn evening party in the North Building Auditorium, inviting Comrade Liu Baiyu and Professors Feng Zhi and Yang Hui to speak. In their speeches, they all emphasized that to commemorate "December 1st," it is necessary to inherit the revolutionary spirit of "December 1st" to implement the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the fruits of victory won by the martyrs with their blood. When talking about literary work, Liu Baiyu said, "As literary workers, we need to stand at the forefront of the times and at the forefront of the real struggle."
