    The Transition Period from Capitalism to Socialism in the Soviet Union
    Yevgeny, Doctor of Philosophy (Soviet Union)
    Editor's Note: Doctor of Philosophy Yevgeny is a famous Soviet philosopher and a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Since participating in the struggle in the Soviet philosophical circles against the Menshevik-leaning idealist thought represented by Deborin from 1931 to 1935, Comrade Yevgeny has been one of the most active and contributing scholars and fighters on the Soviet ideological front. Comrade Yevgeny was recently invited to lecture in China, and in addition to Beijing, he also visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Xi'an, and other places. This article is based on his lecture given in Beijing on September 21st. This lecture provides a scientific explanation of the great historical transformation of the transition period from capitalism to socialism in the Soviet Union. Readers are encouraged to pay attention to reading it.
    The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a new society—a socialist society. Socialism was built in the Soviet Union from October 1917 to 1936. Before 1921, the Soviet state had to engage in a brutal armed struggle against foreign imperialist armed interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionaries.
    From 1922 to 1928, the Soviet state engaged in the restoration of the national economy that had been devastated by the imperialist war and the civil war.
    The great economic transformation of the Soviet Union, starting with the first Stalinist Five-Year Plan in 1928-1929, up until the fascist German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, fundamentally changed our country's economic, political, and cultural landscape. The Soviet state had to wage a difficult war against German imperialism. Germany was one of the powerful industrial countries in Europe. Hitler had almost all of continental Europe under his control and used the economic and military strength of capitalist Europe to oppose the Soviet Union. In addition, Hitler's Germany continued to receive economic assistance from the United States secretly during the war. The United States and Britain deliberately delayed their military operations against Germany in order to weaken the Soviet Union as much as possible and to subject both Germany and the Soviet Union to themselves as a result of the war.
    Nevertheless, the Soviet state, fighting alone against Hitler's Germany and its allies, achieved a great victory over the international forces of fascism.
    This victory was won at a great cost. The Soviet Union lost seven million people in this war. Our industry and agriculture suffered tremendous losses.
    Despite this, in the shortest possible time after World War II, the Soviet state not only healed the postwar wounds but also achieved new great achievements in the development of productive forces.
    In 1950, the Soviet Union's total industrial output exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 50 percent. Agriculture also greatly exceeded pre-war levels.
    Such powerful productive forces have been created in our country, enabling us to solve various major problems on the path of further economic and technological development of socialist society.
    In 1949, the Soviet government approved the fifteen-year afforestation plan for the arid grassland regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. This conscious plan to transform nature is unprecedented in history.
    Just a few weeks ago, the Soviet government passed resolutions on the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River and the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal. These are gigantic projects unparalleled in the world in terms of construction scale and speed.
    The Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations will provide about 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This exceeds the electricity generation of all power stations in Italy. These two hydroelectric power stations will irrigate about 14 million hectares of land, turning deserts and sandy soils into fertile farmland and pastures. The scope and scale of these two hydroelectric power station construction projects can be judged solely by the fact that they require the excavation of 750 million cubic meters of earth and the use of 13 million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete.
    The construction period for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is five years, and for the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, it is six years.
    Meanwhile, the construction of the hydroelectric power station on the Tennessee River in the United States has been going on for 35 years and is still not completed. The construction of the Washington Hydroelectric Power Station has been going on for 25 years and is still not completed. Yet these hydroelectric power stations are less capable than the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations.
    The Turkmen Main Canal is 1,100 kilometers long—the largest canal in the world. The water flow from this canal will turn the dead Karakum Desert into millions of hectares of beautiful farmland and pasture. These hydroelectric power stations and canals are only part of the major creative work being carried out by the Soviet state. The development of socialist productive forces has reached such a capacity that the Soviet Union has surpassed all capitalist countries, including the United States, in terms of economic development scale and speed.
    The Soviet Union's massive natural transformation, economic and technological transformation, is so important in our history in terms of its scale and fundamental significance that it will transition our Soviet society directly from socialist society to communist society. The productive forces of communist society will guarantee such abundance of all life's amenities that people will live according to communist principles, that is, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
    The Soviet Union's transition to communist society will require another ten to fifteen years.
    The Soviet state has not always been so powerful. Old Tsarist Russia was a weak country in terms of industrial development and particularly backward in agriculture. In the past, Russia was a semi-literate country and also weak militarily. The great transformation that made our country one of the most advanced in the world was only possible after the Great October Socialist Revolution. In order to transform old, weak, landlord-capitalist Russia in all aspects into the powerful Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, it was necessary to go through the entire historical transition period from capitalism to socialism.
    My talk today will be about this transition period from capitalism to socialism in the Soviet Union.
  Characteristics of the Socialist Revolution
    The Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union opened a new era in human history. The Soviet regime, which emerged from the Russian October Revolution, aimed to create a new socialist mode of production and establish a communist society.
    The socialist mode of production cannot arise and develop spontaneously within the old society, as happened when one mode of production was replaced by another, such as when slavery was replaced by feudalism and feudalism by capitalism. Within capitalism, the objective and subjective prerequisites for creating a socialist mode of production arise and develop.
    In the process of socialist revolution, after seizing state power, the working class leads all the laboring masses, consciously building socialism according to a plan, based on understanding and mastering the laws of social development.
    Because the proletarian revolution is fundamentally different from the bourgeois revolution, a revolutionary transition period, a whole historical era, is necessary for the socialist transformation of society.
    Comrade Stalin wrote: "The transition from capitalism to communism should not be regarded as a fleeting period, as a batch of 'most revolutionary' laws and decrees, but as an entire historical era, which includes civil wars and foreign conflicts, persistent organizational work and economic construction, offensives and retreats, victories and defeats. This historical era is necessary not only to create those economic and cultural prerequisites that guarantee the complete victory of socialism, but also so that the proletariat can: first, educate and train itself into a force capable of managing the country; second, re-educate and transform the petty-bourgeois strata in the direction that guarantees the organization of socialist production." (Stalin, Foundations of Leninism, p. 55, Foreign Languages Publishing House)
    The necessity of a revolutionary transition period from capitalism to communism was discovered by Marx and Engels.
    Marx wrote:
    "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." (Marx, Critique of the Gotha Program. Marx-Engels Collected Works, Vol. 15, p. 283, Russian Edition)
    But Marx and Engels did not live to see the era of socialist revolution. The creators of the new and complete theory and tactics of proletarian revolution were Lenin and Stalin, and the source of this theory and tactics of proletarian revolution was Russia.
  The Doctrine of the Victory of Socialism in One Country
    Lenin and Stalin enriched Marxism with the doctrine that socialism could be victorious in one country. In developing Marxist theory, Lenin concluded that it was necessary to replace the old idea that socialism could be victorious simultaneously in all or most capitalist countries with a new approach: that socialism could not be victorious simultaneously in all countries and that it could be victorious first in a single capitalist country.
    Lenin and Stalin's approach regarding the possibility of socialism being victorious in one country opened up revolutionary prospects for the working class in every country, inspiring the proletariat to fight for the victory of socialist revolution.
    Lenin and Stalin's conclusion regarding the possibility of socialism being victorious in one country was embodied in the Great October Socialist Revolution and in the realization of socialism in the Soviet Union. The question of the means and conditions for the transition from capitalism to communism was raised in a new way.
    The socialist revolution first broke through the imperialist front in Russia because modern contradictions had reached extreme sharpness in Russia. Our country, occupying one-sixth of the global landmass, with dozens of nationalities headed by the great Russian people, and possessing various abundant natural resources, embarked on the path of capitalist development much later than many other countries due to many historical reasons. However, despite the obstacles posed by the remnants of serfdom and the extremely corrupt Tsarist system, capitalist relations developed rapidly and violently in Russia. Before the revolution, Russia was already among the capitalist countries with a medium level of development. The high concentration of industry in terms of the number of workers promoted the unity and activeness of the working class. The development of capitalist relations in the countryside fostered the role of the peasant masses as allies of the proletariat in the revolution.
  The Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Its Role in the Transition Period
    The transition period from capitalism to socialism begins with the overthrow of the bourgeois regime and the establishment of the dictatorship of the working class. The dictatorship of the working class is the basic and decisive condition for building socialism. It is the highest form of the class struggle of the proletariat and its continuation under new conditions and in new forms. In bourgeois society, the working class is an oppressed and powerless class. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, it becomes the class that seizes state leadership.
    The supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the alliance of the working class with the laboring peasant masses, with the working class playing a leading role, to eliminate the exploiting classes, establish a socialist society, and gradually eliminate classes and class distinctions in general.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat plays a decisive role in the socialist transformation of society. In societies of exploiters, the state is the organized and centralized force used by the ruling class to control the oppressed classes. This state plays a significant role in the emergence and consolidation of past modes of production. However, this state power can only promote or hinder the economic processes that are taking place spontaneously and in an unorganized manner in society, accelerating or delaying these processes.
    When transitioning from capitalism to socialism, the state plays a fundamentally different role. It emerges as the transformer of the social system, the creator of new modes of production, and the organizer of new forms of social relations. This stems from the essence of the socialist revolution and the tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the socialist transformation of society is of a conscious and planned nature and begins only with the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat, on the one hand, crushes the resistance of the exploiters, protects the country from the hostile actions of the capitalist encirclement, and, on the other hand, builds a new socialist economy. It eliminates the old bourgeois relations of production and creates new socialist relations of production. It develops the new productive forces necessary for creating and developing the socialist mode of production.
    The state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union is the Soviet government. The dictatorship of the working class leads the laboring masses and organizes them to struggle against the reactionary forces of the old society. Both the economic foundation of society and the entire ideology, all aspects of social life and consciousness, are subject to transformation.
    Lenin wrote: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a persistent struggle, bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative, against the forces and traditions of the old society." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 25, p. 190, Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder, Russian Edition)
    In the socialist state system, the organizing and guiding role belongs to the Communist Party, which takes the most advanced Marxist-Leninist theory as its guide to action.
  The Emergence of Socialist Components in the National Economy
    The Soviet regime began by seizing the commanding heights of the national economy—the most important and decisive positions in economic life.
    On October 26, 1917 (November 8 according to the old Russian calendar), the Second Congress of Soviets passed the Land Decree, abolishing private land ownership forever. The land of landlords and monasteries was confiscated, that is, forcibly and without compensation, nationalized. The land, together with its mineral resources, forests, and water resources, became state property, that is, the property of the whole people.
    As a result of this decree, peasants obtained more than 150 million hectares of land that had previously been in the hands of landlords, the bourgeoisie, the royal family, churches, and monasteries. All this land was given to the laborers for use without compensation. The peasants were exempted from paying approximately 500 million rubles of rent annually to the landlords.
    In the months from the end of 1917 to the middle of 1918, a series of measures were implemented that destroyed the economic power of the bourgeoisie and laid the foundation for organizing a new Soviet national economy.
    In December 1917, banks were nationalized.
    The first measure of the Soviet regime in industry was the implementation of workers' control over production and the buying and selling of goods in all enterprises employing wage labor. Commercial secrets were abolished. The implementation of workers' control hindered the sabotage of capitalists, and on the other hand, it enabled the Soviet regime to train thousands of future economic leaders.
    The Soviet regime progressed from workers' control over individual enterprises to control over entire industrial sectors, and then to the nationalization of industrial enterprises, which was carried out through confiscation. Step by step, hundreds of large factories, railways, and merchant fleets became state property.
    The Soviet regime abolished—that is, declared null and void—all debts concluded by the Tsarist government and the bourgeois Provisional Government with foreign capitalists or domestic capitalists. Foreign trade was monopolized by the state.
    The control over the commanding heights of the national economy played an outstanding role in the subsequent struggle for socialism.
    The enterprises from which the exploiters had been driven out were transferred to Soviet state property, that is, became the property of the whole people. In these enterprises, the exploitation of man by man was eliminated, which means that the nature of the relations of production was fundamentally changed.
    In this way, a new, socialist component was created in our economy.
    This component was the leading component in the economy, but for a long time, it was not the only component, let alone the dominant component. In 1918 and 1921, Lenin pointed out that there were five socio-economic components in the Soviet economy:
    (1) Patriarchal, that is, peasant economy, which to a considerable extent was a natural economy;
    (2) Small commodity production; This included the majority of peasants who sold grain;
    (3) Private capitalist economy;
    (4) State capitalism;
    (5) Socialism.
    In this period, the basic forms of socio-economic activity were: socialism, small commodity production, and capitalism. Corresponding to these three basic forms of socio-economic activity were these three basic forces: the proletariat, the peasantry, and the bourgeoisie.
  War Communism
    The brief respite after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was replaced by the civil war that broke out in the middle of 1918. Foreign armed interventionists and White bandit rebels occupied Ukraine, the Caucasus, Turkestan, and Siberia—sources of industrial raw materials, fuel, and food. The patriotic war of the workers and peasants of the Soviet Republic against internal and external enemies lasted for three years. All other tasks, including economic tasks, were aimed at ensuring the victory of this war.
    According to Lenin, the Soviet state was a besieged fortress.
    The task of the Soviet regime in the economic sphere was to ensure the needs of national defense, supply the Soviet army with food, and save the working masses in the cities from starvation. The system of economic policies of the Soviet regime formed during the years of the civil war, known as War Communism, was used to solve these tasks.
    Under the conditions of the civil war, the military-political alliance between the working class and the basic peasant masses was organized and consolidated. The purpose of this alliance was to unite the forces of workers and peasants to repel the attacks of foreign invaders and White bandits, defend the motherland, defend the Soviet regime, and defend the land obtained from the landlords. Peasants paid grain to the Soviet regime and did their best to support the struggle against armed intervention and counter-revolution.
    The national economy had been extremely weakened under the impact of years of war. In 1920, large industrial products were almost six times lower than in 1913, while the number of industrial workers was half that of 1913. Agricultural products were halved compared to pre-war levels. In particular, the sown area of ​​technical crops was greatly reduced. The commodity rate of the peasant economy had fallen to the extreme. In order to make up for state expenditures, a large amount of paper money was issued, which quickly depreciated.
    After defeating the armed interventionists and White bandits, the state began to turn to peaceful economic construction. But practical life told us that in order to start peaceful economic construction, it was necessary to change the previous economic policy. After the end of the civil war, peasants expressed dissatisfaction with the surplus grain collection system and the lack of commodities. Dissatisfaction also emerged among some workers due to hunger and exhaustion.
    In order to build socialism, it was necessary to establish a solid economic alliance between the working class and the basic peasant masses. In order to build the socialist foundation of our economy and develop industry, it was necessary to start with agriculture first.
  Transition to the New Economic Policy. The Essence of the New Economic Policy.
    After the end of the civil war, in the spring of 1921, the Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin turned to a policy that met the needs of peaceful economic construction. This policy is called the New Economic Policy.
    In order to drive the entire chain of economic construction, the basic link that should be grasped at that time was commerce. When transitioning to the New Economic Policy, Lenin put forward a primary task before the Communists—the task of learning to do business.
    The Bolshevik Party's plan was to increase the economic interest of small farmers to ensure the rapid recovery of agriculture; to improve the country's industry on this basis and push out private capital; to accumulate sufficient funds to establish a strong socialist industry, and then to move to a firm offensive to finally eradicate the remnants of capitalism.
    The essence of the New Economic Policy was completely explained in the classic definition given by Comrade Stalin:
    "The New Economic Policy is a special policy of the proletarian state that allows capitalism to exist under the condition that all economic lifelines are in the hands of the proletarian state. The goal of this policy is to make the socialist components compete with the capitalist components, develop the role of socialism to squeeze out the capitalist components, make the socialist components defeat the capitalist components, completely eliminate classes, and establish the economic foundation of socialism." (Concluding remarks of the Central Political Report to the 14th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 7, p. 364)
    Comrade Stalin revealed the duality of economic policy and proved that the essence of the New Economic Policy is the struggle of socialist components against capitalist components. This struggle is expected to result in the victory of socialist components over capitalist components.
    Various economic components, backed by various classes, launched a firm struggle between capitalism and socialism, a struggle of life and death, in which the question of "who defeats whom" was resolved.
    The New Economic Policy fully guaranteed the possibility of building a socialist society in our country economically and politically. The Bolshevik Party led the laboring masses of the Soviet Republic in the struggle for socialism and turned this possibility into reality.
    Comrade Stalin elucidated the international significance of the New Economic Policy, saying that it was a policy of the dictatorship of the proletariat aimed at using the market to conquer capitalist components and build a socialist economy. In 1928, Comrade Stalin said:
    "Can any capitalist country, even the most developed of them, do without the New Economic Policy when transitioning from capitalism to socialism? I think not. To some extent, the New Economic Policy, its market ties, and the use of these market ties are absolutely necessary for every capitalist country during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat." (On the Program of the Communist International. Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 11, p. 145)
    The current experience of the people's democratic countries in Central and Southeastern Europe is fully confirming Stalin's prediction.
     The Task of Eliminating Domestic Technical and Economic Backwardness.
    After the victory of the socialist revolution in our country, a major task was to eliminate technical and economic backwardness.
    Pre-revolutionary Russia ranked first in the world in terms of territory and third in the world in terms of population, but in terms of industrial production level, it was far behind other capitalist countries. The proportion of Russia's share of world industrial products in 1913 was 2.6 percent, while the United States accounted for 38.2 percent, the United Kingdom for 12.1 percent, Germany for 15.3 percent, and France for 6.6 percent.
    In terms of the equipment of modern means of production, Russia at that time was four times inferior to the United Kingdom, five times inferior to Germany, and ten times inferior to the United States.
    Russia possessed extremely rich natural resources, but in 1913, the industrial products produced, calculated on the basis of per capita distribution, were four and a half times less than in the United Kingdom, three and a half times less than in France, and three times less than in Germany.
    Economic and technological backwardness made Tsarist Russia dependent on foreign countries. Russia had to import a large amount of equipment and other means of production from abroad, and even import millions of scythes for the countryside. A large proportion of Russian enterprises were in the hands of foreign capital. Almost half of the capital of industrial joint-stock companies was foreign capital, and about three-quarters of the capital of Russia's major banks was foreign capital. In the most important sectors of heavy industry—coal mining, metallurgy, the petroleum industry, the electrical technology industry, and the machinery manufacturing industry—everything was controlled by foreign capitalists. Fearing the loss of their positions, they did everything possible to hinder the development of heavy industry, especially the development of modern machinery manufacturing.
    The reactionary Tsarist autocratic political system, which suffocated all lively and progressive forces in the country, and technical and economic backwardness, made Tsarist Russia extremely weak militarily. This weakness was exposed in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 and in the First World War of 1914-1918.
    No ruling class in Russia in the past could not only eliminate its centuries-old backwardness, but could not even bring this issue to a realistic basis. Only the working class could complete this task. In the face of the greatest danger in our country, the working class under the leadership of the Bolsheviks united the broad masses of laborers around themselves, took power into their own hands, and set about transforming society in a socialist way.
    On the eve of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin emphasized that catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries not only in the political field but also in the technical and economic fields was a matter of life and death for our country. Either perish or go all out towards socialism—this is how history posed the question to Russia.
    To eliminate the economic and technological backwardness of our country, it was necessary to implement two fundamental economic reforms: one was national industrialization, that is, the establishment of modern heavy industry; and the other was to transfer agriculture to the track of large-scale production, that is, to establish large-scale and highly productive agriculture in the countryside.
    For our country to catch up with technically and economically advanced countries by the usual capitalist development method from backwardness to progress, it would take at least fifty to one hundred years, even under the best conditions. But such a long period of peace was naturally impossible. Therefore, to quickly transform our country from backward to advanced, from an agricultural country to an industrial country, required a leap forward.
    This leap forward could only be achieved along the path of socialist development, based on utilizing its advantages over the capitalist development path.
    Lenin and Stalin's theory that the industrialization of the Soviet Union was the basic condition for building a socialist society was an outstanding contribution to the theory of scientific communism. The essence of socialist industrialization lies not in simply developing industry, but in developing heavy industry, especially the core of heavy industry—machinery manufacturing, because only by establishing heavy industry and our own machinery manufacturing can we guarantee the material foundation of socialism and put the country in an independent position that does not depend on the capitalist world. This is a concretization of Lenin and Stalin's theory of the possibility of building socialism in one country, in the Soviet Union. Socialist industrialization created the material and technical basis for the socialist transformation of agriculture. The theory of socialist industrialization has been fully confirmed by the practical experience of the Soviet Union.
     The Socialist Industrialization of the Soviet Union and Its Tasks
    The initial period of the New Economic Policy was to restore and heal the damage and wounds suffered by the national economy during the First World War and the Civil War.
    By the end of the restoration period, the question of the future and nature of our construction, the question of the fate of socialism in our country, and the question of whether socialism could be built in the Soviet Union had become extremely important.
    After many years, Comrade Stalin, in explaining the path that had been taken, said:
    "As everyone knows, what we inherited from the old era was a technologically backward country, an almost impoverished and bankrupt country. It was destroyed by both the four years of imperialist war and the three years of civil war. Its residents were mostly illiterate, technologically backward, and its industry was like individual islands submerged in the vast ocean of countless small-peasant economies—this is the country that the old era bequeathed to us. The task at that time was to transfer this country from the orbit of medieval darkness and ignorance to the orbit of modern industry and mechanized agriculture. As you can see, the task was very serious and very difficult. The question at that time was posed in this way: either we solve this task in the shortest possible time, and then consolidate socialism in our country, or we cannot solve this task, and then our country, which is technically weak and culturally backward, will lose its independent status and become a toy of the imperialist powers" (Stalin's speech at the graduation ceremony of the Red Army Academy held in the Kremlin. See "Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, pp. 646-647).
    In order to start socialist construction, the basic link that should be grasped was socialist national industrialization. In 1925, at the 14th Party Congress, which went down in history as the congress of industrialization, the policy of socialist national industrialization was elevated to the primary position of all economic construction.
    At that time, the fundamental task of economic construction was to establish large-scale industry, first of all, the large-scale industry that manufactures the means of production. Large-scale industry is the economic foundation of socialism, and for the following reasons, it is also the most important condition for national independence:
    First, large-scale industry concentrates within itself all the achievements of science and technology. These achievements equip labor and greatly increase labor productivity. Therefore, the rapid development of large-scale industry is the most important condition for achieving a new social labor productivity that is higher than that of capitalism. The highest labor productivity—this is, in the final analysis, the most important and most important thing that will make the new social system victorious.
    Second, socialist large-scale industry is the foundation of the dictatorship of the working class. The expansion of this foundation is the increase in the number of workers and the increase in the proportion of the working class in society. The growth of large-scale industry is a condition for consolidating the dictatorship of the working class, strengthening the position of the working class in the struggle against capitalist elements, guaranteeing the victory over capitalist elements, and guaranteeing the leadership of the working class over millions of peasant masses.
    Third, the road to the socialist transformation of agriculture is through the establishment of large-scale industry. Large-scale industry produces tractors, combines, and modern agricultural machines necessary for establishing the technical foundation of socialist large-scale agriculture.
    Fourth, strong modern industry is the foundation of national economic independence because it guarantees that all sectors of the national economy have the means of production necessary for technological transformation.
    Fifth, large-scale industry is the foundation for consolidating national defense and national military-economic power because it produces armaments. Under the current state of military technology, a large number of armaments are needed once a war is waged.
    Sixth, only on the basis of the strong development of large-scale industry can the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries economically be solved.
    It can be seen from this that not any industrial development can solve the historical tasks of Soviet industrialization. In order to eliminate the technical and economic backwardness inherited from Tsarist Russia, it was necessary to first ensure that heavy industry, that is, the industry that manufactures the means of production, achieved rapid development. It was necessary to establish a powerful machinery manufacturing industry, which is the main link of industrialization, the essence of industrialization, because it is the key to technically re-equipping all sectors of the national economy; it was necessary to establish a first-class military industry in order to protect the country from imperialist attacks; it was necessary to establish factories for tractors, combines, and modern agricultural machines.
    Therefore, the industrialization of the Soviet Union is the law of socialist development in our country. The policy of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union was generated by the most urgent material interests of the Soviet people, and it meets the most important economic needs of the Soviet people.

    苏联从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期
    苏联哲学博士  尤金
    编者按：哲学博士尤金是苏联著名的哲学家，苏联科学院的通讯院士。自从一九三一年到一九三五年参加苏联哲学界反对以德波林为代表的孟塞维化的唯心论思想的斗争以来，尤金同志一直是苏联思想战线上最活跃，最有贡献的学者和战士之一。尤金同志最近应邀来中国讲学，除北京外，还到了上海、杭州、广州、汉口、西安等地。本篇是他在九月二十一日在北京所作的讲演，这篇讲演对于苏联从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的巨大历史转变作了科学的说明，希望读者注意阅读。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟是新的社会——社会主义社会。从一九一七年十月至一九三六年在苏联建成了社会主义。一九二一年以前苏维埃国家曾不得不与外国帝国主义者——武装干涉者及国内反革命进行残酷的武装斗争。
    从一九二二年至一九二八年苏维埃国家曾从事于在帝国主义战争和内战后所遭受破坏的国民经济的恢复工作。
    苏联的伟大经济改革，自一九二八——一九二九年度第一个斯大林五年计划开始，至一九四一年法西斯德国进犯苏联为止，我国根本改变了自己经济的、政治的和文化的面貌。苏维埃国家不得不与德国帝国主义进行艰苦战争。德国曾是欧洲强大的工业国家之一。希特勒几乎使全部欧洲大陆受他的支配，并且利用了资本主义欧洲的经济和军事力量来反对苏联。此外，希特勒德国，在战争期内曾用秘密方法继续由美国获得经济援助。美国与英国故意拖延了自己反对德国的军事行动，以便尽量削弱苏联，并使德国和苏联由于战争的结果服从自己。
    虽然如此，苏维埃国家在单独与希特勒德国及其盟国作战中，获得了对法西斯主义国际势力的伟大胜利。
    这种胜利是付出了伟大的代价才赢得的。在这次战争里苏联丧失了七百万人。我们的工业和农业受到了巨大损失。
    虽然如此，在第二次世界大战后最短时间内苏维埃国家不但治愈了战后创伤，而且在生产力发展方面达到了新的伟大成就。
    一九五○年苏联工业总生产量较战前一九四○年超过百分之五十。农业也大大超过了战前水准。
    在我国创造了如此强有力的生产力，使我国能在社会主义社会的经济和技术进一步发展道路上解决各种重大问题。
    一九四九年苏联政府批准了苏联欧洲部分旱地草原地区的十五年造林计划。这种自觉的改造自然的计划是历史上空前未有的。
    仅数星期以前，苏联政府通过了在伏尔加河上建设古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站及建设土库曼大运河的决议。这按照建筑的规模和速度来说，都是世界无比的庞大工程。
    古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站每年将供给约二百亿千瓦时的电力。这超过了意大利全国所有发电站的发电量。这两个水电站将灌溉土地约一千四百万海克脱，使沙漠和沙土变为肥沃的耕地和牧场。这两个水电站建筑工程的范围和规模只用它要掘土七亿五千万立方公尺，要用一千三百万立方公尺混凝土和钢骨水泥这一点就可以判断了。
    古比雪夫水电站建筑期间为五年，斯大林格勒水电站为六年。
    同时，美国田纳西河上的水电站建筑进行了三十五年，至今还未完成。华盛顿水电站建筑进行了二十五年，如今也未完成。而这些水电站却比较古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的能力还差。
    土库曼大运河全长一千一百公里——是世界上最大的运河。这条运河的水流能使卡拉库姆的死沙漠变为千百万海克脱的美好的耕地和牧场。这些水电站和运河——仅是苏维埃国家进行的重大创造工作的一部分。社会主义生产力的发展达到这样的能力，按经济发展的规模和速度，苏联已超越了所有资本主义国家，包括美国在内。
    苏联的庞大自然改造，经济和技术改造在我国历史上按其规模和原则意义是如此重要，它们将把我们苏维埃社会从社会主义社会紧接过渡到共产主义社会。共产主义社会的生产力能把一切生活福利保证得这样的丰富，使人们将按共产主义的原则，即各尽所能，各取所需的原则生活。
    苏联之过渡到共产主义社会，还需十年至十五年的时间。
    苏维埃国家并非向来是这样强有力的。旧时沙皇俄国在工业发展上是衰弱的国家，而特别在农业上是落后的。以前俄国是个半文盲国家，在军事方面也是个衰弱的国家。使我国列入世界上最先进国家的伟大改造，只在伟大十月社会主义革命后才是可能的。为使得在一切方面老的衰弱的地主资本主义俄国变为强有力的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，需要经过从资本主义走向社会主义的整段历史过渡时期。
    关于苏联这一从资本主义走向社会主义的过渡时期，就是我在今日的谈话中所要讲的。
  社会主义革命的特征
    苏联的伟大十月社会主义革命在人类史上开辟了新的纪元。俄国十月革命所产生的苏维埃政权，其目的是创造新的社会主义生产方式，建立共产主义社会。
    社会主义生产方式，不能在旧社会内部发生和自发地发展，像先前一种生产方式被另种生产方式替代时所发生的那样，像奴隶制度被封建制度替代时以及封建制度被资本主义制度替代时所发生的那样。在资本主义内部发生着和发展着创造社会主义生产方式的客观和主观的前提。
    工人阶级在社会主义革命过程中，取得国家政权后领导着所有劳动群众，依据认识社会的发展规律并掌握这些规律按计划自觉地建设着社会主义。
    由于无产阶级革命与资产阶级革命有着根本的区别，所以为了社会主义地改造社会，就必需有一个革命的过渡时期，它是一整个历史时代。
    斯大林同志写道：“不应把从资本主义到共产主义的过渡，看做是转瞬即逝的时期，看做一批‘最革命的’法律与法令，而要把它看做是一整段历史时代，其中包含有国内战争和国外冲突，坚持的组织工作和经济建设，进攻和退却，胜利和失败。这一个历史时代之所以必要，不仅是为要创造那些保证社会主义完全胜利的经济上和文化上的前提，并且是为要使无产阶级能够：第一，把自己教育并锻炼成为能够管理国家的力量，第二，按照那个保证组织社会主义生产的方向来重新教育并改造小资产阶层”。（斯大林，论列宁主义基础，第五五页，外国文书籍出版局）
    从资本主义到共产主义的革命过渡时期的必要性，是由马克思和恩格斯发现的。
    马克思写道：
    “在资本主义社会与共产主义社会之间，有着一个从前者到后者的革命转变时期。同这个时期相适合的也有一个政治过渡时期，而这时期的国家，则只能是无产阶级的革命专政”。（马克思，哥达纲领批判。马克思全集第十五卷，第二八三页，俄文版）
    但是马克思和恩格斯没有活到社会主义革命时代。新的完整的无产阶级革命理论和策略的创造者，是列宁和斯大林，而这种无产阶级革命理论和策略的策源地是俄国。
  社会主义在一个国家中胜利的学说
    列宁和斯大林以社会主义可能在一国胜利的学说丰富了马克思主义。列宁在发展马克思主义理论时，得出了这样一个结论：必需用社会主义不可能在一切国家同时胜利和社会主义可能首先在单独一个资本主义国家胜利的新方针，来代替社会主义在一切的或多数的资本主义国家同时胜利的旧观念。
    列宁斯大林关于社会主义可能在一国胜利的方针，给每一国家的工人阶级展开了革命的前途，鼓舞着无产阶级为社会主义革命的胜利而斗争。
    列宁斯大林关于社会主义可能在一国胜利的结论，在伟大十月社会主义革命中，在苏联社会主义的实现中得到了体现。关于从资本主义过渡到共产主义的手段和条件问题，已经按新的方式提出了。
    社会主义革命最先在俄国突破了帝国主义战线，因为在俄国现代的矛盾达到了极端尖锐的程度。我国占全球土地的六分之一，有着以伟大俄罗斯人民为首的数十种民族，拥有各种丰富的自然资源，由于许多历史的原因，它踏上资本主义发展的道路，比其他许多国家要晚得多。但是，尽管有着农奴制的残余和腐败已极的沙皇制度所造成的障碍，资本主义关系仍迅速而猛烈地在俄国发展起来了。在革命以前，俄国已侧身于具有中等发展水准的资本主义国家了。就工人数量来说的工业的高度集中，促进了工人阶级的团结与积极化。资本主义关系在农村的发展，培养了农民群众在革命中起着无产阶级同盟者的作用。
  无产阶级专政及其在过渡时期的作用
    从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，是从推翻资产阶级政权和建立工人阶级专政开始的。工人阶级专政是建成社会主义的基本的和决定的条件。它是无产阶级阶级斗争的最高形式，是其在新条件和新形式下的继续。在资产阶级社会中，工人阶级是受压迫的，无权的阶级。在无产阶级专政之下，它就成为把国家领导权拿到手里的阶级了。
    无产阶级专政的最高原则，是工人阶级与劳动农民群众结成联盟，工人阶级起着领导的作用，来肃清剥削阶级，建立社会主义社会，并逐渐消灭阶级和社会的一般阶级区分。
    无产阶级专政在社会主义地改造社会中起着决定的作用。在剥削者的社会中，国家是统治阶级用来控制被压迫阶级的有组织的和集中的力量。这种国家在以往的生产方式的发生和巩固上，起着重大的作用。可是这种国家政权仅能促进或阻挠在社会中自发地、无组织地进行着的经济过程，加速或延缓这些过程。
    从资本主义过渡至社会主义时，国家在原则上起着另一种作用。它是以社会制度的改造者，新生产方式的创造者，新的社会关系形式的组织者而出现。这是由于社会主义革命的本质和无产阶级专政的任务而来的。因为社会主义地改造社会，带着自觉的有计划的性质，并且仅由无产阶级专政的确立而开始的。
    无产阶级专政一面击破剥削者的反抗，保护国家不受资本主义包围的敌对行动的危害，一面建设着新的社会主义经济。它消灭旧的资产阶级的生产关系，并创造新的社会主义生产关系。它发展着为创造和发展社会主义生产方式所必需的新的生产力。
    在苏联的无产阶级专政的国家形式，就是苏维埃政府。工人阶级专政领导着劳动群众，并把他们组织起来为反对旧社会的反动势力而斗争。无论是社会的经济基础，无论是整个意识形态，凡是社会生活和意识的各方面都遭到改造。
    列宁写道：“无产阶级专政，就是一种反对旧社会的势力及其传统的坚持斗争，流血与不流血的，强力与和平的，军事与经济的，教育与行政的斗争”。（列宁全集，第二十五卷，第一九○页，共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病，俄文版）
    在社会主义国家体系中，组织的和指导的作用，是属于以最先进的马列主义理论为其行动指南的共产党的。
  国民经济的社会主义成份的发生
    苏维埃政权一开始就着手掌握国民经济的命脉——经济生活中最主要的和具有决定意义的阵地。
    一九一七年十月二十六日（即旧俄历十一月八日）第二届苏维埃代表大会通过了土地法令。永远废除了土地私有权。地主和寺院的土地被没收，即强制地无代价地收归国有。土地连同其矿藏、森林和水利均成为了国家财产，即全民的财产。
    由于这个法令，农民获得一亿五千万俄顷以上的土地，这些土地从前是在地主、资产阶级、皇族、教堂和寺院手里的。这些土地全部无代价地归劳动者使用。农民被免除了向地主交纳每年约计五亿卢布的地租。
    一九一七年末至一九一八年中的数月内，实行了一系列的措施，这些措施摧毁了资产阶级的经济力量，为组织新的苏维埃国民经济奠定了基础。
    一九一七年十二月，实行了银行国有化。
    苏维埃政权在工业中的第一个措施，是在采用雇佣劳动力的一切企业中，实行了工人对生产与商品买卖的监督。废除了商业秘密。工人监督制的实行，阻碍了资本家的怠业，而另一方面，又使苏维埃政权培养了成千个未来的经济工作领导者。
    苏维埃政权由工人对个别企业的监督，进到对整个工业部门的监督，然后又进到工业企业的国有化，这种国有化是以没收的方法而实现的。一步一步地国有化了，即成百的大工厂、铁路、商船队都成为了国家的财产。
    苏维埃政权废除了——即宣布取消——沙皇政府和资产阶级临时政府与外国资本家或本国资本家所缔结的一切债务。对外贸易已归国家垄断了。
    对国民经济命脉的掌握，在以后争取社会主义的全部斗争中，曾起了卓越的作用。
    剥削者已被赶走的企业，都转为苏维埃国家财产，即成为了全民的财产，在这些企业中，消灭了人对人的剥削，这就是说，根本改变了生产关系的性质。
    在我国的经济中就这样创造了新的、社会主义的成份。
    这种成份是经济中的领导成份，但长时期内不是唯一的成份，更不是占优势的成份。一九一八年和一九二一年列宁曾指出，在苏维埃经济中存在着五种社会经济成份：
    （一）宗法的，即在颇大程度上是自然的农民经济；
    （二）小商品生产；这里包括出卖粮食的大多数农民；
    （三）私人经济的资本主义；
    （四）国家资本主义；
    （五）社会主义。
    在这一时期，社会经济的基本形式是：社会主义，小商品生产，资本主义。适应着社会经济的这三种基本形式的，是这三种基本力量。无产阶级，农民，资产阶级。
  军事共产主义
    布列斯特和约缔结后的短促暂息时机，又为一九一八年年中爆发的国内战争所代替了。外国武装干涉者和白匪叛乱分子占领了乌克兰、高加索、土尔基斯坦，西伯利亚——工业原料、燃料和粮食的来源地。苏维埃共和国的工人和农民反抗内外敌人的卫国战争，延续了三年。所有其他任务，包括经济任务在内，都是为了保证这一战争的胜利。
    照列宁的说法，苏维埃国家是一个被包围的要塞。
    苏维埃政权在经济方面的任务，就在于保证国防的需要，供给苏维埃军队以粮食，拯救各城市中的工人群众免于饿死。在国内战争年代中所形成的苏维埃政权的经济政策体系，即人所共知的所谓军事共产主义，就是用来解决这些任务的。
    在国内战争的情况下，组织了和巩固了工人阶级和农民之间的军事政治联盟。这个联盟的目的，是统一工人和农民的力量，来击退外国强盗和白匪的袭击，保卫祖国，保卫苏维埃政权，保卫从地主手中得来的土地。农民向苏维埃政权交纳粮食，尽力支持反抗武装干涉和反革命的斗争。
    国民经济在多年战争的影响之下，已经极端衰落。大工业产品在一九二○年比起一九一三年来几乎缩减了六倍，而产业工人的数目则比一九一三年减少了一倍。农产品较战前水平降低一倍。特别是技术作物的播种面积大为缩小。农民经济的商品率已经降落到极点。为了弥补国家开支，发行了大量的纸币，这些纸币很快就贬值了。
    在击溃了武装干涉者和白匪以后，国家开始转向和平的经济建设。但实际生活告诉我们，为要开始和平的经济建设，必须改变以前的经济政策。农民在国内战争结束以后对余粮收集制和商品缺乏表示不满。在一部分工人中间由于饥饿和疲惫，也表露出不满情绪。
    为了建设社会主义，必须在工人阶级与基本农民群众之间建立起巩固的经济联盟。为要建立我国经济的社会主义基础，为要发展工业，就必须先从农业开始。
  过渡到新经济政策。新经济政策的实质。
    国内战争结束后，一九二一年春季，在列宁和斯大林领导下的布尔什维克党，转到了适应和平经济建设需要的政策。这个政策叫做新经济政策。
    为了带动整个经济建设链条而应抓住的基本环节，在当时就是商业。在过渡到新经济政策时，列宁在共产党员面前提出了一个首要的任务——学习经商的任务。
    布尔什维克党的计划，在于提高小农的经济兴趣来保证迅速恢复农业；以此为基础来提高国家的工业，排挤私人资本；积累充裕的资金，以便建立强大的社会主义工业，然后转入坚决的进攻，以便最后根绝资本主义的残余。
    在斯大林同志所下的经典式的定义中，曾完尽地说明了新经济政策的实质：
    “新经济政策是在一切经济命脉都操于无产阶级国家手中的条件之下，容许资本主义存在的无产阶级国家的一种特殊政策，这个政策的目标就是：使社会主义成份去与资本主义的成份斗争，发展社会主义的作用以排挤资本主义的成份，使社会主义的成份战胜资本主义的成份，彻底消灭阶级，建立社会主义的经济基础”。（向联共（布）第十四次代表大会所作的中央政治总结报告的结束语。斯大林全集第七卷第三六四页）
    斯大林同志揭明了经济政策的两重性，证明新经济政策的实质是社会主义成份对资本主义成份的斗争，这一斗争是指望在社会主义成份战胜资本主义成份的。
    各种经济成份有各种阶级为后盾，展开了资本主义与社会主义之间的坚决斗争，生死的斗争，在这一斗争中解决“谁战胜谁”的问题。
    新经济政策在经济上和政治上完全保证了我国有建成社会主义社会的可能。布尔什维克党在争取社会主义的斗争中领导着苏维埃共和国的劳动群众，把这一可能变成了现实。
    斯大林同志阐明了新经济政策的国际意义，说它是旨在利用市场来征服资本主义成份和建设社会主义经济的无产阶级专政的政策。一九二八年斯大林同志曾说：
    “凡是资本主义国家，即令是其中最发达的国家，在由资本主义过渡到社会主义时，没有新经济政策，是否能行呢？我想，是不行的。在某种程度上，新经济政策及其市场的联系以及对这些市场联系的利用，对于每个资本主义国家来说，在无产阶级专政时期都是绝对必要的”。（论共产国际纲领。斯大林全集第十一卷第一四五页）
    中欧和东南欧各人民民主国家的现时经验，正充分证实着斯大林的这一预见。
     消除国内技术经济落后的任务。
    在我国社会主义革命胜利后，摆着这样一个重大任务：消除技术上经济上的落后性。
    革命前的俄国，地域之大占世界第一位，居民之多占世界第三位，但就其工业生产水平来说，却远远落后于其他各资本主义国家。沙皇俄国在世界工业产品中所占的比重，在一九一三年为百分之二·六，而当时美国则为百分之三八·二，英国则为百分之一二·一，德国为百分之一五·三，法国为百分之六·六。
    就现代生产工具的装备来说，当时俄国劣于英国四倍，劣于德国五倍，劣于美国十倍。
    俄国拥有极丰富的自然资源，但在一九一三年所生产的工业品，按分摊给每一居民来计算，较英国少四倍半，较法国少三倍半，较德国少三倍。
    经济和技术的落后，使沙皇俄国仰赖于外国。俄国曾不得不从国外输入大量的设备和其他生产资料，甚至要为农村输入几百万把镰刀。俄国很大部分企业，是掌握在外国资本手中，工业股份公司的资本几乎有一半是外国资本，而俄国各大银行的资本约有四分之三是外国资本。在重工业的最重要部门——采煤业、冶金业、石油业、电气技术业、机器制造业中，都是由外国资本家操纵一切的。他们深怕丧失自己的阵地，用尽各种方法来阻挠重工业的发展，特别是现代机器制造业的发展。
    窒息国内一切生动进步力量的反动沙皇专制政治制度，以及技术的经济的落后，使沙皇俄国在军事方面也极其软弱，在一九○四——一九○五年的俄日战争以及一九一四——一九一八年的第一次世界大战中，这种软弱性就暴露出来了。
    从前俄国任何一个统治阶级，不仅不能消灭它的整世纪以来的落后性，而且甚至不能把这个问题提到现实的基础上来。只有工人阶级才能完成这个任务。在我国面临着最大危险的情况下，在布尔什维克领导下的工人阶级把广大劳动群众团结在自己的周围，把政权拿到了自己的手里，并着手来社会主义地改造社会。
    还在伟大十月社会主义革命前夜，列宁就着重指出，不仅在政治方面，而且在技术经济方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家，乃是我国的生死问题。或者是灭亡，或者是全力走向社会主义——历史就是这样向俄国提出问题的。
    要消灭我国经济、技术的落后，就必须实行两种根本的经济改革，一个是国家工业化，即是建立起现代化的重工业；一个是把农业转入大生产的轨道上，即是在农村中建立起大规模的生产率很高的农业。
    要以通常的由落后到进步的资本主义发展方法赶上在技术经济方面先进的国家，对我国来说，甚至在最好的情况下，至少也得需要五十年到一百年。但这样长久的和平时期自然是不能有的。因此，要迅速使我国由落后变为先进，由农业国变为工业国，是需要一个跃进的。
    这种跃进，只有沿着社会主义发展的道路，在利用其超越于资本主义发展道路的优点的基础上才能实现。
    列宁和斯大林关于苏联工业化是建成社会主义社会的基本条件的学说，是对科学共产主义理论的卓越贡献。社会主义工业化的实质，不在于简简单单的发展工业，而是在于发展重工业，首先是发展重工业的核心——机器制造业，因为只有建立起重工业和自己的机器制造业，才能保证社会主义的物质基础，并使国家处于不依赖资本主义世界而独立的地位。这是列宁、斯大林关于可能在一个国家内，在苏联，建成社会主义的理论的具体化。社会主义工业化为社会主义改造农业创立了物质技术基础。社会主义工业化的学说，为苏联的实际经验全面证实了。
     苏联社会主义工业化及其任务
    新经济政策的初期，是恢复和医治国民经济在第一次世界大战及国内战争过程中所遭受到的破坏和创伤。
    到恢复时期结束时，关于我们建设的前途和性质的问题，关于我国社会主义的命运问题，关于能否在苏联建成社会主义的问题，成了极为重要的问题。
    经过许多年后，斯大林同志在说明已经走过的道路时说：
    “大家知道，我们从旧时代方面所得到的遗产，是一个技术落后的国家，几乎是赤贫的、破产的国家。它是既被四年帝国主义战争所破坏了，又被三年国内战争所破坏了的，其中居民很少识字，技术落后，工业好像个别孤岛一样沉没在无数小农经济的汪洋大海中——这就是旧时代所遗传给我们的国家。当时的任务是要把这个国家由中世纪的黑暗无知的轨道上，转移到现代工业和机器化农业的轨道上去。可见，任务是很严重，很困难的。当时的问题是这样摆着：或者是我们在最短时期内解决这个任务，于是在我国把社会主义巩固起来，或者是我们解决不了这个任务，那时我们这个技术薄弱、文化落后的国家就会丧失独立的地位，而变成为帝国主义列强的玩具”（斯大林在克列姆里宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说。见《列宁主义问题》莫斯科中文版第六四六——六四七页）。
    为了着手展开社会主义建设，应当抓住的基本环节，是社会主义国家工业化。一九二五年，在以工业化的代表大会载入史册的第十四次党代表大会上，社会主义国家工业化的方针，被提到了全部经济建设的首要地位。
    当时经济建设的根本任务，是建立大工业，首先是制造生产资料的大工业，大工业是社会主义的经济基础，由于下述原因又是国家独立自主的最重要的条件：
    第一，大工业在本身中集结着一切科学技术的成就，这些成就武装着劳动，并大大提高劳动生产率。因此，大工业的迅速发展，是达到新的，比资本主义更高的社会劳动生产率的最重要的条件。而最高的劳动生产率——这归根到底是使新的社会制度得到胜利的最主要，最重要的东西。
    第二，社会主义大工业，是工人阶级专政的基础。这个基础的扩大，就是工人阶级数目的增多，就是工人阶级在社会中的比重的增大。大工业的增长，是巩固工人阶级专政的条件，是加强工人阶级在反对资本主义分子斗争中的阵地，是战胜资本主义分子的保证，是巩固工人阶级对千百万农民群众的领导作用的保证。
    第三，走向农业的社会主义改造的道路，是通过大工业的建立的。大工业生产出为建立社会主义大农业的技术基础所必需的拖拉机，康拜因机，现代农业机器。
    第四、强大的现代工业，是国家经济独立的基础，因为它保证一切国民经济部门有着为进行技术改造所必需的生产资料。
    第五，大工业是巩固国防和国家军事经济威力的基础，它生产军火。在目前军事技术状况下，一旦进行战争，是需要很大数量的军火的。
    第六，只有在大工业强大发展的基础上，才能解决在经济上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务。
    由此可见，不是任何的工业发展就可解决苏联工业化的历史任务的。为了消灭由沙皇俄国继承下来的技术经济的落后，必须首先保证重工业，即是制造生产资料的工业，得到迅速的发展，必须建立起强大的机器制造业，它是工业化的主要环节，工业化的精髓，因为它是以技术上改装一切国民经济部门的关键；必须建立头等的军事工业，以便保卫国家不受帝国主义的袭击；必须建立拖拉机、康拜因机、现代农业机器工厂。
    因此，苏联的工业化是我国社会主义发展的规律。苏联社会主义工业化的方针，是由苏联人民最迫切的物质利益产生出来的，它符合苏联人民最关紧要的经济需要。
