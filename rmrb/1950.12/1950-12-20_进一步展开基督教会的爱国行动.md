    Further Develop Patriotic Actions of the Christian Church
    From a Twenty-Eight-Year Christian Gao Zhulin:
    As our country's Christian churches (including the majority of believers) declare their resolute severance of ties with imperialism and join the great patriotic movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea, I, as a Christian of twenty-eight years, am willing to follow the Christian compatriots of the whole country, actively participate in this glorious rank of loving the motherland, and hope that our fellow believers will unite closely to further develop the patriotic actions of the Christian Church. Here are my few opinions:
    (1) The Christian Church's Reform Movement Manifesto and the decision and implementation of the "Three-Self" Five-Year Plan must be based on the church's own clear understanding of the imperialists' conspiracy to use the church as an instrument of aggression, which has aroused hatred and anger. It must be based on the church's political awareness, recognizing the justice of the new China's resistance against America and aid to Korea to protect the country and defend world peace, which has aroused loyal support and determination. Only in this way can the Chinese Christian Church advance step by step in patriotic action! Only in this way can the Reform Movement and the "Three-Self" Five-Year Plan be faithfully implemented, and can it avoid people suspecting that the purpose of these actions is only to cope with and perfunctorily deal with the situation, in order to alleviate and change the psychology of the people's suspicion of the church.
    (2) The Chinese Christian Church should take further practical actions in its own work to resolutely strike a merciless blow at the imperialists' aggressive crimes! Today, it should resolutely and completely cut off all relations with the imperialists! Declare that the Chinese church is free from the shackles of the "mother church" of the imperialist countries! Under this principle, make the greatest determination and effort to resolutely overcome the difficulties that may be encountered in "self-government, self-support, and self-propagation." Never allow difficulties to weaken the church's will to fight against the imperialists.
    (3) The Chinese Christian Church should safeguard and establish the inviolable dignity of our country and nation in its own work, despise any "assistance" from the "mother church" of the imperialist countries, and should refuse to accept their material and human support in the future, so as not to give the imperialists an excuse to support the work of the Chinese church and insult our country and people. Austin's slanderous accusations against the church's work in the Security Council should be severely condemned! Give him a counterattack with practical actions!
    (4) The Chinese Christian Church should immediately and promptly, in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner, mobilize all existing human and material resources to establish all possible production order, promote labor production, and promote production education, in order to improve the existing economic situation and the "sitting and eating the mountains empty" salary system.
    (5) Universally carry out current affairs studies among church workers and believers, so that they can reliably understand the bright and great future of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and sincerely support the Central People's Government and all its laws and decrees from the bottom of their hearts.
    (6) Carry out universal review and self-criticism among workers and believers, eliminate all muddled ideas of being pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America, deepen the faith and determination of our Christian "self-government, self-support, and self-propagation," and deepen the sense of hatred, anger, and contempt for American imperialists.
    (7) Christian churches and believers throughout the country should enthusiastically, in an organized and step-by-step manner, participate in the actual actions of resisting America and aiding Korea, such as organizing or participating in the Korean war zone ambulance medical team or donating condolence bags and letters, etc., to give a straightforward and thorough blow to the American imperialists who are carrying out cultural aggression through the church!
    But here it must be pointed out to the Chinese Christian Church: According to the five-year plan of the Shanghai National Christian Council of China regarding the relationship with the "mother church" of the United States and Britain—"to make friendly understanding with the 'mother church' so that their assistance will gradually decrease within five years, gradually becoming the Chinese' own church," I cannot help but suspect that the Chinese Christian Church still has some traditional attachment and dependence on the American imperialists, and there are still some illusions about the American imperialists. Of course, it is actually difficult for the church to immediately implement "self-government, self-support, and self-propagation" today, but we must never continue to accept the "assistance" of the imperialists because of these difficulties, so as to allow Austin and his ilk to use this to insult our country and people!

    Editor's note: The opinions put forward in Mr. Gao Zhulin's letter are very sincere. Regarding the relationship between the Chinese church and the "mother church" of the imperialist countries, we hope that the local churches can study feasible methods in this great patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect the country, implement self-reliance in a planned and step-by-step manner, and cut off economic ties with the "mother church" of the imperialist countries as soon as possible, and implement the policy of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation.

### 进一步展开基督教会的爱国行动

    进一步展开基督教会的爱国行动
    二十八年的基督徒  高竹林编者先生：
    正当我国基督教会（包括大多数信徒）宣布坚决割断与帝国主义的关系，而卷入伟大的中国人民抗美援朝的爱国运动的浪潮的时候，我愿以一个二十八年基督徒的资格，追随全国基督同道之后，积极参加这一热爱祖国的光荣行列，并希望我们同道紧密团结起来，进一步展开基督教会的爱国行动。现把我的几点意见写在下面：
    （一）基督教会的革新运动宣言和“三自”五年计划的决定和进行，必须是基于教会本身清楚地认识了帝国主义者利用教会作侵略工具的诡计而引起的憎恶和愤怒。必须是基于教会在政治上的觉悟，认清新中国抗美援朝保家卫国和保卫世界和平的正义而引起的忠诚拥护和决心。惟其如此，中国基督教会才能在爱国行动上有步骤地前进再前进！惟其如此，才能忠诚地执行革新运动和“三自”的五年计划，也才能不使人怀疑这些行动的目的只是为了应付和敷衍时局，借以缓和与转变国人对教会怀疑的心理。
    （二）中国基督教会应当在其本身的工作上以进一步的实际行动，坚决地给帝国主义者的侵略罪行以无情的打击！就在今天，毅然决然地干干净净地和帝国主义者割断一切关系！宣布中国教会脱离帝国主义国家“母会”的羁绊！在这个原则下以最大的决心和努力来坚决克服“自治自养自传”可能遇到的困难。绝不叫困难削弱教会对于帝国主义者应有的斗争意志。
    （三）中国基督教会应当在其本身工作上维护和建立我国家民族不可侮的尊严，蔑视帝国主义国家“母会”的任何“协助”，今后应拒绝接受他们的物力和人力的支持，不给帝国主义者借口支持中国教会工作来侮辱我国家人民。对于奥斯汀在安理会上对教会工作的谰言诬蔑应予严厉斥责！以实际行动给他一个回击！
    （四）中国基督教会应即从速有组织有计划有步骤地动员现有的一切人力物力来建立一切可能的生产秩序，提倡劳动生产，推动生产教育，以改善现有的经济状况和“坐吃山空”的薪给制度。
    （五）在教会工作人员和信徒当中普遍地展开时事学习，使他们有凭有据地认识新中国在毛主席和共产党领导下前途的光明和伟大，从内心忠诚地拥护中央人民政府及其一切法令。
    （六）在工作人员和信徒中间展开普遍地检讨和自我批评，肃清一切亲美、崇美、恐美的糊涂思想，加深我国基督徒的“自治自养自传”的信念与决心，加深对美帝国主义者的憎恶愤怒和蔑视的意念。
    （七）全国基督教会和信徒们应以热烈的情绪有组织有步骤地参加抗美援朝的实际行动，例如组织或参加朝鲜战地救护医疗队或捐募慰问袋和信函等，给予借教会实行文化侵略的美帝国主义者以干脆而彻底的打击！
    但这里必须向中国基督教会指出：根据上海中华全国基督教协进会关于与美英国家“母会”关系所决定的五年计划——“与‘母会’作友谊的谅解使他们的协助在五年内逐渐减少，逐渐地成为中国人自己的教会”，对于这，我不能不怀疑中国基督教会多少还存在着传统的对于美帝国主义者的依恋和依赖心理，还存在着对于美帝国主义者的某些幻想。当然，教会要在今天立即实行“自治自养自传”是有其实际的困难，但我们绝不要因为这一些困难，就仍继续接受帝国主义者“协助”，以使奥斯汀之流借此来侮辱我国家人民！
    一九五○、一二、一○、于昌黎
    编者按：高竹林先生来信中所提的意见是很恳切的。其中关于中国教会与帝国主义国家的“母会”的关系问题，我们希望各地教会在此抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动中，能研究出可行的办法，有计划有步骤地实行自力更生，早日与帝国主义国家的“母会”割断经济上的联系，贯彻实现自治自养自传的方针。
