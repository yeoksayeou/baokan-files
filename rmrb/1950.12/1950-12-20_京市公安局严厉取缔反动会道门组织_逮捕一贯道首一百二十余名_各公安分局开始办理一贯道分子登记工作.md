    Beijing Public Security Bureau Sternly Bans Reactionary Secret Societies
    Arrests Over One Hundred Twenty Yi Guandao Leaders
    Public Security Sub-bureaus Begin Registering Yi Guandao Members
    [Report from this Newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal Information Office: In order to protect the people's interests, maintain social order, and save the deceived masses who have gone astray, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a proclamation on the 19th, sternly banning the reactionary, feudal superstitious organization Yi Guandao, and ordering all secret societies to disband immediately and cease all activities. The Beijing Public Security Bureau has been ordered to arrest 122 Yi Guandao leaders, including Wang Zhonglin, Mi Guoquan, Fu Guangwei, An Songqiao, Tian Yuxiang, Guo Xuke, and Lu Maochuan. On the spot, pseudo-national flags, Kuomintang flags, pistols, various bullets, and reactionary documents such as oracular sayings used for spreading rumors were seized. The Public Security Bureau is currently interrogating the above-mentioned criminals. According to the provisions of the Municipal People's Government's proclamation sternly banning Yi Guandao, all public security sub-bureaus in the city began registering Yi Guandao members from yesterday, starting with those at the rank of altar leader (家坛主) and above (including the "Three Talents" (三才)).
    Yi Guandao is a reactionary organization controlled by many counter-revolutionary secret agent bandits, which destroys the revolution, endangers the people, disrupts society, rapes women, and defrauds money.
    As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Yi Guandao leaders colluded with Japanese invaders and traitors to do evil; after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they colluded with Kuomintang bureaucrats and secret agents to harm the masses. Yi Guandao's big boss, Zhang Guangbi, under the command of Japanese spy chief Mitsuru Toyama, used the slogan "The Convergence of All Religions" to carry out activities on a large scale, expand the organization, and actively serve the Japanese invaders. Zhang Wufu, the Yi Guandao leader in Beijing, also colluded with Yuri, the captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie, and together with Gong Pengling, became an advisor to the Japanese Gendarmerie, exploring our army's intelligence in various places and helping the Japanese invaders, consistently opposing communism. Zhang Guangbi colluded with the great traitor Chu Minyi, serving as a diplomatic advisor to Wang Jingwei's puppet government. In April and May 1945, Chu Minyi convened secret agent "Dian Chuan Shi" (点传师 - Initiators/Transmitters) at the Yingbin Hotel on Dingfu Street. Zhang Wufu, Zhang Fosheng, and Zhang Guangbi praised Chu Minyi highly, and Chu also spoke highly of Yi Guandao. Chu Minyi, Zhou Fohai, Wang Yitang, Hu Yukun, and Jiang Chaozong, these great traitors, were all Yi Guandao members. Zhou Fohai was an "Altar Leader," and Chu Minyi was a "Dian Chuan Shi." In addition, many "Altar Leaders" and "Dian Chuan Shi" were mostly heads of enemy and puppet Baojia systems, and Kuomintang secret agents. For example, Lu Hanqing and Liu Xiyuan, who were arrested by the Beijing Public Security Bureau in June this year, were both Kuomintang bandit gang Central Bureau and Military Bureau secret agents.
    After the liberation of Beijing, the Yi Guandao bandits not only showed no intention of repenting to the people, but intensified their various sabotage activities, specifically opposing the People's Government and the liberated people. For example, when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River last year, Yi Guandao spread rumors on a large scale, saying: "The Liberation Army cannot cross the river and has been beaten back." In the Yi Guandao leaflet "Pointing the Way" seized in Landianchang in the western suburbs, it called on followers to resist the People's Government, asking Yi Guandao followers to "unite as one, share the same heart and courage, those who are literate use writing, those who are martial use force, combine strength and then use adamantine (ruthless) means... after experiencing all kinds of hardships, there will naturally be a day of success." Last November, in the home of Zhou Chunshen of the "Chunyi Altar," instructions from the sect's leaders were found, including the statement that "the leaders of Yi Guandao will be the future true lords, and the Dian Chuan Shi will all hold positions above county magistrate." The leaders of Yi Guandao, fearing that their followers would awaken and correct their evil ways, used this shameless rumor-mongering to encourage them to continue engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. When the people of the whole country were celebrating the establishment of their Central People's Government with unprecedented enthusiasm, they used "oracular sayings" to engage in insults, and even fabricated rumors that "heaven's will was not favorable" when it rained on "May 1st" and "May 4th."
    Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, Yi Guandao has become even more rampant, attempting to coordinate with the US and Chiang Kai-shek from within. They even secretly organized armed forces, attempting to riot. This autumn, Yi Guandao created and spread the terrifying rumors of "cutting off testicles and cutting off breasts" on a large scale, in order to intimidate the masses, create social unrest, and undermine production and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. After the US expanded its war of aggression against Korea, Yi Guandao spread even more rumors, hoping to create fear of the US, but these rumors were shattered by the victory on the Korean front and the surging patriotic Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
    In addition, Yi Guandao followers used feudal superstition to defraud property, rape women, and do everything evil, causing great losses to the masses. For example, at the end of August in Mentougou, Yi Guandao spread rumors that "holy water" that could cure all diseases came from the earth mountain in Xinkou, Fangshan County. Many people carried grain and ran for more than a hundred li to seek the "holy water" to cure their illnesses at home. As a result, many patients who drank the "holy water" either had their illnesses worsen or died. Chen Yaba from Fengcun repeatedly sought treatment, but the mute was still mute! (Attached picture)

    京市公安局严厉取缔反动会道门组织
    逮捕一贯道首一百二十余名
    各公安分局开始办理一贯道分子登记工作
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市人民政府为保障人民利益，维护社会秩序，并挽救误入歧途的受骗群众，于十九日布告严厉取缔反动的封建迷信组织一贯道，并限令所有会道门一律解散，不得再有任何活动。京市公安局已奉令将一贯道首王钟麟、米国权、傅光炜、安松樵、田玉祥、郭绪恪、卢茂川等一百二十二人予以逮捕。当场并搜出伪国旗、国民党旗、手枪、各种子弹及为造谣所用的乩语等反动证件一部。现公安局对上述各犯正在进行审讯中。根据市人民政府严厉取缔一贯道的布告规定，本市各公安分局自昨日起已开始办理一贯道点传师以下家坛主以上分子（包括三才）登记工作。
    按一贯道是一个由很多反革命的特务匪徒操纵把持，破坏革命，危害人民，扰乱社会，奸淫妇女，诈骗钱财的反动组织。
    早在抗日战争期间，一贯道头子便勾结日寇汉奸作恶；在抗战胜利后，他们又勾结国民党官僚和特务危害群众。一贯道大头子张光璧就曾在日本特务头子头山满的指挥下，以“万教归一”为口号，大肆活动，扩展组织，积极为日寇服务。一贯道北京道长张五福又与日宪兵队长由里勾结，和宫彭龄一起做了日本宪兵队的顾问，到各地刺探我军情报，帮助日寇，一贯反共。张光璧与大汉奸褚民谊勾结，做汪逆精卫汉奸政府的外交顾问，一九四五年四五月间，褚民谊在定阜大街迎宾馆召集特务“点传师”们开会，张五福、张佛生、张光璧大捧褚民谊，褚也对一贯道赞不绝口。褚民谊、周佛海、王揖唐、胡毓坤、江朝宗这些大汉奸都是一贯道徒。周佛海是“坛主”，褚民谊是“点传师”。另外许多“坛主”、“点传师”等大都是敌伪的保甲长，国民党的特务。如今年六月间为京市公安局逮捕之吕翰卿、刘燮元等都是国民党匪帮中统、军统特务。
    北京解放后，一贯道的匪首们不但没有向人民悔过的意思，反而变本加厉，进行各种破坏活动，专门和人民政府、和翻身了的人民为敌。如人民解放军去年过江时，一贯道就大事散播谣言说：“解放军过不了江，都被打回来了。”在西郊蓝靛厂查获的一贯道传单“指明路”上，则号召道徒反抗人民政府，要一贯道徒“联成一气，同心共胆，能文的用文，能武的用武，合群合力，然后再拿出金刚（狠毒）手段，……历尽了千辛万苦，自有那成功的一天”。去年十一月，在“纯一坛”周纯身家中，搜出该道首脑的指示，其中有“一贯道的首领即是将来的真主，点传师都是县长以上职位”的话。一贯道的首脑，唯恐道徒觉悟改邪归正，就用这种无耻的造谣，鼓励他们继续从事反革命活动。当全国人民空前热烈地庆祝自己的中央人民政府成立之时，他们就通过“乩语”来从事辱骂，甚至连“五一”“五四”下了雨，也造谣说“天意不顺”。
    自从美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，一贯道益发猖獗，妄图和美蒋“里应外合”。他们甚至秘密组织武装，企图暴乱。今年秋季，一贯道曾大事制造和传播“割蛋割乳房”的恐怖谣言，借以恐吓群众，造成社会不安，破坏生产和抗美援朝运动。美帝扩大侵朝战争后，一贯道更大事散布谣言，希图制造恐美情绪，但是这些谣言，都为朝鲜前线胜利和汹涌澎湃的人民爱国的抗美援朝运动打得粉碎。
    此外一贯道徒利用封建迷信，诈骗财物，奸淫妇女，无所不为，造成群众极大损失。如八月底在门头沟，一贯道造谣说房山县新开口土山中出“圣水”能治百病，许多群众都背上粮食跑百多里地去求了“圣水”，回家医病人，结果很多病人喝了“圣水”，不是病势加重，就是死了，冯村陈哑叭接二连三求治，结果哑叭还是哑叭！（附图片）
