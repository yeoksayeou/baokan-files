Farmers in the suburbs of Jilin City and Dunhua accept challenge from Han En
[Reported by this newspaper] Agricultural model workers and farmers in areas such as the suburbs of Jilin City and Dunhua have successively proposed challenges to Han En, a national agricultural model worker, guaranteeing to do a good job in sideline production this winter and prepare for next year's production, actively supporting the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Song Banggui's group, a provincial second-class model group in the suburbs of Jilin City, consisting of twenty households, guaranteed to accept the challenge with four conditions: completing next year's production preparation work ahead of schedule, doing a good job in sideline production, delivering public grain well, and running winter schools well. Farmers in Chengjihao Village, Eleventh District of Dunhua County, were all eager to try and put forward various guarantee conditions to challenge Han En. Liu Chengshan, the leader of the second group in the village, said: "If our model workers twist into one rope and lead the masses to do a good job in production, this is the power to defeat U.S. imperialism and defend our good life!" The farmers of the whole village proposed to guarantee to do a good job in winter sideline production and prepare for next year's production to challenge Han En. Regarding sideline production, in addition to the already organized thirteen carts, thirty-nine horses, three cows, and thirty-nine laborers continuing to strengthen the timber industry, some laborers will also be drawn to weave mats and make leather, and the total sideline income of the village will reach 630 million yuan. Regarding the preparation for next year's production, the main task is to accumulate fertilizer, with the plan to apply manure to 90% of the cultivated land area. There are currently more than 800 carts, and women and children will be organized to collect 530 carts of manure. In addition, 1,600 sleds of firewood should be prepared. The seeds selected from the fields this year will be sorted again. It is guaranteed that a universal trial planting will be carried out next spring, and efforts will be made to increase the yield by seven dou per hectare next year. Xue Chengfu, a model worker in Dunhua County, represented Beidayang Village in challenging Han En. In addition to guaranteeing to do a good job in winter sideline production, preparing for next year's production, and delivering public grain well, the conditions for accepting the challenge also include running cooperative supply and marketing work well. In order to earnestly implement the conditions for accepting the challenge, it was decided that the whole village would start sending manure from December 25th, sending 1,900 carts this year and completing the task by the second month of the old lunar calendar next year. In addition to making timber, sideline production will also organize labor to weave mats, screens, set roe deer traps, and build fish weirs, with a total income of more than 400.6 million yuan (Northeast currency), which will be used to add carts, buy horses, and expand cooperative shares. Guan Weicheng, a provincial mutual aid group model in Dunhua County, represented the whole village in challenging Han En, expressing that not only will they do a good job in winter sideline production and prepare for next year's production, but also combine production with support for the Korean front. The farmers of the whole village have voluntarily organized a civilian labor team; in addition, they will launch a movement to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and the farmers of the whole village have already donated 15 shi and 8 dou of grain.
