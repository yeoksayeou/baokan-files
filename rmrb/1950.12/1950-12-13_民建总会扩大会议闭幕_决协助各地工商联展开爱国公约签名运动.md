Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) General Meeting, lasting thirteen days, concluded on the 11th. During the meeting, the attending representatives listened to the political report by the General Convener of the Association, Zhang Naiqi, entitled "Unite the National Industrial and Commercial Circles to Fight Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country." This report, after repeated discussions and supplements in plenary sessions, group meetings, and presidium meetings, achieved the spirit of fully developing democracy and unity. The conference also held group discussions on association affairs, determining the future work guidelines and tasks. In addition, the conference held multiple symposiums for industrial and commercial groups, exchanging views on issues such as the relationship between the CDNCA and local Federations of Industry and Commerce, the relationship between public and private sectors, labor-capital relations raised by local industrial and commercial circles, and how industrial and commercial circles can stabilize prices and actively pay taxes in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

At the closing meeting, Zhang Naiqi gave a summary speech on the political report and solemnly read out the full text of the political report.

Finally, the General Convener Nan Hanchen delivered the closing speech: He said: Today's resistance to the U.S. is different from the past resistance to Japan because the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism is not as obvious as that of Japanese imperialism, and some people find it difficult to recognize. Therefore, the CDNCA must strengthen its propaganda work, strengthen unity, expand unity, and closely cooperate with the national industrial and commercial circles to accomplish the great task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country. The conference approved the "Proposal on Assisting Local Federations of Industry and Commerce in Launching a Patriotic Pact Signature Campaign and Suggesting the Organization of Inspections on the Implementation of the Patriotic Pact"; "Congratulatory Telegram to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea"; and "Proposal to Organize a Comfort Mission to Korea to Comfort the Troops."

    民建总会扩大会议闭幕
    决协助各地工商联展开爱国公约签名运动
    【新华社十二日讯】民主建国会总会扩大会议历时十三天，已于十一日闭幕。会议期间，到会代表听取了该会总会召集人章乃器的“全国工商界团结起来为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗”的政治报告。该报告经大会、小组会、主席团等会议反复讨论和补充，达到充分发挥民主、团结的精神。大会并分组讨论会务，确定了今后工作方针与任务。此外会议曾举行工商小组座谈会多次，对民建会与各地工商联的关系问题、各地工商界提出的公私关系、劳资关系以及工商界在抗美援朝运动中如何稳定物价、踊跃纳税等问题，交换了意见。
    闭幕会上，由章乃器对政治报告作总结讲话并郑重地宣读了政治报告全文。
    最后由总会召集人南汉宸致闭幕词：他说：今日抗美与过去抗日不同，因为美帝国主义的侵略面目不像日本帝国主义那样明显，有些人还不易认清，因此民建会必须加强宣传工作，同时要加强团结，扩大团结，紧密地和全国工商界配合，达成抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大任务。大会通过了“关于协助各地工商联展开爱国公约签名运动，并建议对爱国公约的执行组织检查案”；“向朝鲜人民军、中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队祝捷电”和“组织慰劳团赴朝鲜慰劳等案”。
