    In Xiangyang, Hubei and other places
    Bandits and special agents were discovered setting fire to warehouses
    All regions should pay serious attention to warehouse protection.
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, incidents of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and reactionary landlords setting fire to warehouses have been continuously discovered. These incidents should arouse serious vigilance in all regions. In the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei, during the movement of the broad masses to actively hand in public grain, a person wearing a long gown and carrying a small package on his shoulder was spotted in the No. 1 warehouse directly under the Special Commissioner's Office on the afternoon of November 8th. He mingled with the grain-paying masses, looked around, and stayed for a long time. After that person left, the smell of burning cloth was detected. Upon inspection, smoke was found coming from the cotton warehouse. Comrades managing the warehouse actively rescued and extinguished the fire, thus avoiding major losses. On November 8th, when the Dongjin District Warehouse of Xiangyang County was collecting cotton, a person was also found inserting matches into the cotton, attempting to burn the warehouse. Warehouse personnel immediately arrested the perpetrator and sent him to the district, who in turn transferred him to the Xiangyang County People's Government. The case is currently under careful interrogation and handling. On November 14th, the warehouse in X溝咀下街 of Jianli New District of Mianyang Special District caught fire twice. At the location of the second fire, after the masses extinguished it, forty to fifty matchsticks and easily combustible firewood tied together were found. The Haiwuchang Warehouse in Fengshan Township, Fourth District, Xiangxiang, Hunan, is the largest warehouse in the district, storing more than two million catties of grain. At 6:00 PM on October 26th, Chen Zhongsu, the former Kuomintang branch secretary of the district and a reactionary landlord, accompanied Xie Hengkang, a reactionary landlord from Fengshan, and Chen Renkai, a rogue from Yueshan Township, carrying twenty catties of white explosives and five catties of black explosives, went to sabotage, attempting to destroy all the grain. However, warehouse personnel discovered them and arrested the three arsonists, handing them over to the local public security organs for punishment. In addition, incidents of matches being inserted into cotton have also been continuously discovered in the cotton collection station and the cotton yarn and cloth company of Lingshou County, Hebei Province. Fortunately, the above incidents were discovered early by our cadres and the masses, and no losses were incurred. The superior authorities in each of these places have also notified their subordinates of the matter, urging them to pay serious attention to warehouse security and strictly prevent sabotage by special agents, bandits, and reactionary landlords.

    湖北襄阳等地
    发现匪特放火烧仓库
    各地应严重注意护仓工作
    【本报讯】抗美援朝运动展开以来，连续发现蒋匪特务和反动地主放火烧仓库事件，这些事件，应引起各地严重警惕。湖北襄阳专区在广大群众积极缴纳公粮的运动中，专署直属第一仓库在十一月八日下午发现一个穿长袍肩背小包袱的人，和缴粮群众在一起混入仓内，东张西望停留多时，那人走后，就闻有烧布的臭味。经检查发现棉花仓内向外冒烟，管理仓库同志积极抢救扑灭，才没受重大损失。襄阳县东津区仓库在十一月八日收花时也发现一人在棉花中夹放火柴，企图烧仓库，仓库人员当时就把该犯逮捕送区转解襄阳县人民政府，现正慎重审讯处理。十一月十四日沔阳专署的监利新沟咀下街仓库周围两次起火，在第二次起火处，经群众扑灭后，发现有四五十根火柴棒和易燃烧的柴草捆在一起。湖南湘乡四区枫山乡海屋场仓库，是该区最大的仓库，内存谷子二百多万斤。十月二十六日下午六时，前国民党该区分部书记、反动地主陈仲苏，伴同枫山反动地主谢恒康、月山乡的流氓陈仁凯，携白炸药二十斤、黑炸药五斤，前往破坏，企图将全部粮食炸毁，后经仓库人员发觉，将三个放火犯捕获，送交当地公安机关惩处。此外，河北省灵寿县征棉站及花纱布公司也连续发现棉花内夹有火柴的事件。以上历次事件，幸经我干部和群众及早发现，都未酿成损失。各该地上级机关并已将此事通报所属，促使严重注意仓库保卫工作，严防特务匪徒和反动地主的破坏。
