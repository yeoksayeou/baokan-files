    Several Questions Regarding Young Students and Young Workers Joining Military Cadre Schools
    -- Report by Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, at the Beijing Student "December 9th" and "December 1st" Commemoration Meeting

    Today, we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and the 5th anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement. China's situation is naturally different from what it was fifteen or five years ago, because the Chinese people have already achieved revolutionary victory. However, due to the frantic destruction of world peace by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, its aggression against Korea and China's Taiwan, and its threat to our country's security, conscious Chinese youth should inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotic students of the "December 9th" and "December 1st" eras, and contribute their strength to defending the motherland. The Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council have jointly decided to recruit young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools to accelerate China's modern national defense construction. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Student Federation, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have also called on young students and young workers to actively respond to the government's decision. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about several issues related to young people joining military cadre schools.
  I. Why Should We Accelerate and Strengthen Our National Defense Construction?

    Since the Opium War, our country has been continuously subjected to imperialist aggression. In the past, under the rule of corrupt and reactionary regimes, from the Qing government to the Chiang Kai-shek government, there was no national defense to speak of. Our seaports were wide open, with no navy to guard our thousands of miles of coastline. Our vast airspace had no necessary air force to protect it. Japanese and American invaders attacked our land and people from the air. In China, where the people have achieved victory, this situation cannot be tolerated to continue. Chairman Mao had an earlier instruction in the opening speech of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: " Our national defense will be consolidated, and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again. On the basis of the heroic and tested People's Liberation Army, our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed. We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy."

    Since U.S. imperialism openly invaded Korea and China's Taiwan, the spearhead of the invaders has directly pointed at our country, so "rapidly strengthening our modern national defense construction" is naturally a more pressing need.

    Someone asked: "Recently, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has cooperated with the Korean People's Army to win great victories in Korea. Why should we strengthen our national defense forces?" Because although the American invaders have suffered setbacks in Korea, the aggressive intentions of the American imperialists have not been abandoned, and they are frantically stepping up war preparations; we must not have complacency or relaxation and paralysis. Strengthening our country's air force, navy, and other modern armed services can greatly enhance our national defense, enabling our country to be more powerful in preventing and combating any aggressive actions by U.S. imperialism, thereby safeguarding our national security and consolidating the victory of our people's revolution.
  II. Why Does the Government Call on Young Students and Young Workers to Participate in Modern National Defense Construction?

    First of all, modern national defense construction, such as modern air force, navy, artillery, tanks, communications, etc., requires various scientific knowledge and technologies. Therefore, only young students and young workers with a certain level of education and technical skills can better fulfill this task. In addition, Chinese young students and young workers are rich in patriotism and revolutionary spirit, and have a glorious revolutionary tradition in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and have been tested by history. The modern national defense construction, on which the fate of the country depends, must rely on these outstanding young people with political awareness, cultural knowledge, and technology to master. This time, the government's decision to recruit young students and young workers to participate in modern national defense construction is to regard outstanding young students and young workers as the pillars of the country and place the greatest trust in them.

    When young people participate in military cadre schools, there are two relatively common issues. One is the consideration of personal future; the other is how to deal with family issues.

    Regarding the issue of personal future: Every young person has his/her own aspirations, hoping to have a more ambitious future. That's understandable. However, if we disregard the needs of the country and only plan for our own personal future, this idea is wrong. "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair attach to?" If there is no future for the country, there can be no personal future. Therefore, we should consciously subordinate our own aspirations and ambitions to the needs of the country. Always thinking about the interests of the country and serving the people wholeheartedly is truly worthy of admiration and respect. And this is precisely the noble aspiration that young people should have. If we do not think about the needs and interests of the country, but only think about how to arrange a "bright future" for ourselves, then this kind of person is too short-sighted and too small.

    Regarding family issues: It is natural for parents to care about their children. However, some parents with more conservative ideas tend to adopt a kind of doting attitude towards their children, only willing to keep them in a warm family life and unwilling to let them go to society and struggle to be tempered. This makes their children like flowers in a greenhouse, unable to withstand wind and frost. Objectively, parents are harming their children and causing them to lose their enterprising spirit and broad prospects for development, even though they subjectively love them. Young people cannot abandon their lofty ideals of serving the people because of incorrect family opposition, but they should not adopt a simplistic antagonistic attitude towards their families. They should explain clearly to their parents: responding to the call of the motherland and participating in national defense construction is the sacred responsibility and greatest glory of patriotic youth. The future of the country is consistent with the future of every young person. The interests of the country are also consistent with the interests of every family.
  III. The Principle of Voluntarism and the View of Taking Care of the Overall Situation

    "Students who sign up must be completely voluntary in principle, and after signing up, they must be reviewed and approved by the admission committee of each school and factory before they can be admitted." (Joint decision of the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council)

    This means that although we hope that outstanding young people can actively respond to the government's call, whether each young student and young worker signs up to participate in the military cadre school should be decided entirely by the individual according to the principle of voluntariness. Young people who do not sign up should not be satirized or discriminated against. In fact, the number of recruits this time is limited, and the vast majority of students will still stay in school to continue their studies, and the vast majority of young workers will still stay in the factory to continue production. Adopting an incorrect attitude towards young students and young workers who do not participate in military cadre schools will create opposition with the majority of the masses, which is not good.

    In order to truly implement the principle of voluntariness in practical work, individual registration should be adopted when handling registration procedures at the military cadre school student admission committees of each school and factory. Collective registration, class-wide registration, and mobilization competitions should not be adopted, nor should egalitarian methods be used to stipulate the mobilization figures for each school or factory, because this approach can easily produce some compulsory situations. Recruiting outstanding young people to participate in military cadre schools to strengthen our national defense construction is a glorious cause that conforms to the needs of the country and the interests of the people. It has a very deep moral foundation and a broad mass base, and it can and should be carried out on the basis of the conscious and voluntary efforts of the masses. Only by adhering to the principle of complete voluntariness can the participants actively and happily go to new and glorious positions, learn their skills most quickly and effectively, and consolidate national defense forces. Those who do not participate can also be educated and improve their political understanding.

    The principle of voluntariness also applies to Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in schools and factories should of course play an active leading role in this patriotic movement to participate in military schools. Among the students participating in military schools this time, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members should and need to have a larger proportion to ensure the necessary political quality of the students participating in military schools; but this does not mean that all young Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in schools and factories must sign up to participate. Party members and League members should also consider whether to sign up based on their own wishes and in a realistic manner. They can express their patriotism by signing up to participate in military cadre schools, or they can express their patriotism by working harder. Party members and League members are the same as non-Party and non-League members on this issue.

    For young people who have voluntarily signed up to participate in military cadre schools, the admission committees of each school and factory and the recruitment committees of each region must also conduct serious review work. Not only should they review whether each person's political, cultural, and physical conditions are qualified, ensuring that everyone can meet the needs of national defense construction; but they should also consider whether he/she should enter a military school based on individual circumstances. For example, doctors are very scarce now, so medical students should not be asked to change careers. In addition, students in the third and fourth grades of universities, especially senior students in certain departments of science, engineering, and agricultural colleges (specialized disciplines with little relation to military technology such as textile, metallurgy, animal husbandry, biology, agriculture, and forestry), do not need to be asked to enter military schools, because letting them abandon their relatively familiar specialized knowledge and relearn military technology is a waste of time and a loss to both themselves and society. In factories, if the departure of certain skilled technicians will seriously affect a certain production sector, they should not be allowed to enter military schools. Today, of course, we must first meet the needs of national defense construction, but at the same time, we must take care of the needs of other construction work and ensure that the educational work of schools and the production work of factories can still proceed and develop normally. Some people think that this time the military cadre school recruits students, it will not hesitate to cause serious impact on many schools and factories, and even cause some schools to close. This is a misunderstanding. On the one hand, our new democratic economic and educational work should serve national defense construction; on the other hand, strengthening national defense construction is precisely to ensure the prosperity and development of our economic and cultural construction, free from enemy aggression and sabotage. The relationship between national defense construction and economic and cultural construction is complementary rather than antagonistic.
  IV. What Attitude Should Those Who Do Not Participate Take?

    The participation of the vast number of young students and young workers in China in military cadre schools for the sake of consolidating national defense is another great patriotic youth movement in our country. Young people who sign up to participate in military cadre schools have responded to the call of the motherland with practical actions and are the most active participants in this patriotic youth movement. Other young people who do not participate in military cadre schools should also participate in this patriotic movement in other ways and show the spirit of patriotism of Chinese youth.

    First of all, for classmates or workmates who participate in military cadre schools, we should promote the spirit of unity and friendship, and give them warm condolences and farewells. They resolutely embark on the glorious position of defending the country and should be respected by everyone. Each school and factory should strengthen its unity and mutual assistance through various forms of activities such as seminars and farewell parties, and help solve any difficulties of the families of comrades who participate in military cadre schools, and give them spiritual comfort and encouragement, so that they can actively and happily go to new positions.

    Secondly, students and young workers who did not participate in military cadre schools this time should be more concerned about politics, more concerned about national affairs, strengthen the study of current affairs and politics, and strengthen the education of patriotism and internationalism, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland and serve the motherland at any time.

    Finally, students who stay in school should study harder, and workers who stay in the factory should work harder. Young people should be good at combining patriotic enthusiasm with practical actions, and give full play to their patriotic spirit in their regular learning and production positions.

    But there is an attitude that must be opposed, that is, not taking a supportive attitude towards this patriotic youth movement to strengthen national defense construction, but taking a cold, cynical, oppositional, and antagonistic attitude. To be indifferent to such a great patriotic movement, or to take a discriminatory, satirical, or even attacking and destructive attitude towards the participants, is not only a backward manifestation, but also a violation of the interests of the country and the people, and a betrayal of the patriotic public morality of the Chinese people. If this is due to naivety and ignorance, they should be given good persuasive education. If there are a few bad elements secretly instigating and sabotaging, these bad elements should be exposed and attacked.

    In addition, those who participate in military cadre schools should of course never have a proud or satirical attitude towards those who do not participate. The majority of people did not participate because of work needs, poor health, or other legitimate reasons. Their patriotism is not necessarily behind others. Even if some people lack understanding and determination, they should not be treated with satire and attack, but should still be treated warmly and helped to make progress. Although their level of awareness is not high today, they may make progress tomorrow. We believe that under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, every young person can gradually make progress and can become a person who contributes to the revolution.

    关于青年学生青年工人参加军事干部学校的几个问题
    ——青年团中央副书记蒋南翔在北京学生“一二·九”  “一二·一”纪念大会上的报告
    今天我们纪念“一二·九”运动的十五周年和“一二·一”运动的五周年。中国的情况，自然已经不同于十五年前或五年前的时候，因为中国人民已经取得了革命的胜利。但由于以美国为首的帝国主义集团疯狂地破坏世界和平，侵略朝鲜和中国的台湾，威胁我国安全，因此中国有觉悟的青年应当继承和发扬“一二·九”和“一二·一”时代爱国学生的光荣传统，为捍卫祖国而贡献自己的力量。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院已于日前联合决定招收青年学生、青年工人参加各种军事干部学校，加速中国近代化的国防建设，青年团中央、全国学联、全国总工会也分别号召青年学生、青年工人积极响应政府的决定，我愿借这个机会来谈谈有关青年参加军事干部学校的几个问题。
  一、为什么要加速增强我国国防建设？
    自从鸦片战争以来，我国不断地受到帝国主义的侵略。中国过去在腐败和反动的政权的统治下，从满清政府到蒋介石政府，根本都谈不到有自己的国防。我国的海口是敞开的，没有海军来守卫我国绵延数千里的海岸防线，我国辽阔的领空，没有必要的空军来保护，日本侵略者和美国侵略者，都从空中来袭击我国的土地和人民。在人民取得了胜利的中国，当然不能容忍这种情况长此继续下去。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议的开幕词上早就有过指示：“我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。在英勇的经过了考验的人民解放军的基础上，我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”
    自从美帝国主义公然侵略朝鲜和我国的台湾，侵略者的矛头，已直接指向我国，“迅速增强我国近代化的国防建设”，自然就更为迫切的需要了。
    有人问道：“最近中国人民志愿部队已协同朝鲜人民军队在朝鲜打了大胜仗，为什么还要增强我国的国防力量呢？”——因为美国侵略者虽然在朝鲜受到了挫折，但是美帝国主义者的侵略企图并没有放弃，并且正在疯狂地加紧战争准备；我们决不能有自满或松懈麻痹的思想。增强我国的空军、海军以及其他各种近代化兵种的力量，就能大大增强我们的国防，就能使我国更有力量来防止和打击美帝国主义的任何侵略行动，借以保障我们国家的安全，巩固我国人民革命的胜利。
  二、为什么政府号召青年学生、青年工人来参加现代化国防建设？
    首先因为现代化的国防建设，如近代化的空军、海军、炮兵、坦克、通信等，都需要各种科学的知识和技术，因此只有具有一定文化程度和技术水平的青年学生、青年工人方能更好地胜任这个工作。另外，中国青年学生和青年工人富于爱国心和革命精神，在中国人民革命斗争中，有着光荣的革命传统，经过历史的考验。国家命运所系的近代化国防建设，必须依靠这些有政治觉悟有文化技术的优秀青年来掌握。这次政府决定招收青年学生、青年工人来参加近代化的国防建设，是把优秀的青年学生、青年工人视为国家的干城，对他们寄予了最大的信任。
    在青年参加军事干部学校时，存在着两个比较普遍的问题。一个是考虑个人的前途问题；一个是怎样处理家庭的问题。
    关于个人的前途问题：每个青年有自己的抱负，希望自己将来有更远大的前途，这是应该的。但是如果抛开国家的需要不管，而只打算自己个人的前途，这种想法是错误的。“皮之不存，毛将焉附？”假若没有国家的前途，也就不可能有个人的前途。因此，我们应当自觉地把自己的志愿和抱负，完全服从于国家的需要。时时刻刻都为国家的利益着想，全心全意为人民服务，这是真正值得推崇和尊敬的人。而这也正是青年们应有的高尚抱负。如果不想到国家的需要和国家的利益，只想到怎样为自己个人安排一个“美好前途”，那么这种人未免太近视太渺小了。
    关于家庭问题：父母关心自己的子女，这是当然的。但是有些思想比较保守的家长，对子弟常常容易采取一种溺爱态度，只愿把他们留在温暖的家庭生活中，不愿让他们到社会上、到斗争中去受锻炼，这样就使自己的子女像温室里的花草，经不起风霜。做父母的主观上是爱子女，客观上却使他们丧失了进取心和远大的发展前途。青年们不能因为家庭的不正确反对而放弃自己为人民服务的远大理想，但对家庭也不应采取简单化的对立态度，应该很好地向自己家长解释清楚：响应祖国的号召，参加国防建设事业，这是爱国青年的神圣责任和最大光荣，国家的前途和每个青年的前途是一致的。国家的利益和每一个家庭的利益也是一致的。
  三、自愿的原则和照顾全局的观点
    “报名学生均须完全以自愿为原则，报名以后必须经各学校，工厂的保送委员会的审查批准，才能入学。”（中央人民政府革命军事委员会和政务院的联合决定）
    这就是说，我们虽然希望优秀的青年能够积极响应政府的号召，但是每一个青年学生和青年工人，是否报名参加军事干部学校，应完全按照自愿的原则由个人自己决定。对于不报名的青年们，不得加以讽刺或歧视。事实上，这次招收名额有限，绝大多数的学生还是要留在学校中继续学习，绝大多数的青年工人还是要留在工厂中继续生产，对于不参加军事干部学校的青年学生、青年工人们采取不正确的态度，就将会造成和多数群众的对立，这是不好的。
    为了要在实际工作当中真正能贯彻自愿的原则，在各学校各工厂军事干部学校学生保送委员会办理报名手续时，应该采取个别报名的方式，不要采取集体报名，全班报名，发动竞赛等办法，也不要采取平均主义的办法来规定每一学校、或每一工厂的动员数字，因为这种做法，容易产生某些强制的情形。招收优秀青年参加军事干部学校加强我国国防建设，这是符合国家需要和人民利益的光荣事业，有着很深厚的道义基础和广泛的群众基础，完全可以而且应该在群众自觉自愿的基础上来进行这一工作。只有坚持完全自愿的原则，才能使参加的人积极愉快地走向新的光荣岗位，最迅速有效地学好本领，巩固国防力量。使不参加的人也受到教育，提高自己的政治认识。
    自愿的原则，对于共产党员青年团员，也同样适用。学校、工厂中的共产党员青年团员，在这次参加军事学校的爱国运动中，当然应起积极带头作用，在这次参加军校学生当中，共产党员青年团员应当而且需要有较大的比重，以保证参加军校学生的必要政治质量；但并不是说，学校、工厂中所有的青年共产党员和青年团员，一律都要报名参加。党员团员同样应该根据各人自己的志愿，实事求是地来考虑自己是否去报名，他们可以用报名参加军事干部学校来表示自己的爱国心，也可以用更加努力做好自己的工作来表现自己的爱国心，在这一问题上，党员团员和非党、团员群众都是一样的。
    对于已经志愿报名参加军事干部学校的青年，各学校、工厂的保送委员会和各地的招生委员会，还要进行认真的审查工作。不但要审查每人的政治、文化条件和身体条件是否合格，保证每人均能满足国防建设的需要；而且还要根据个人的具体情况来考虑他是否应当进军事学校，例如现在医生很缺乏，因此学医的学生，就不宜再要他们改行。此外如大学三、四年级的学生，特别是理、工、农学院中某些学系（和军事技术很少关系的专门学科如纺织、矿冶、畜牧、生物、农林等）的高年级学生，就不必再要他们去进军事学校，因为让他们抛开已经比较熟悉的专门知识而去重新学习军事技术，在时间上是一种浪费，对本人对社会都有一些损失。在工厂中，假使某些熟练技术工人的离开，将使某一生产部门受到严重影响，那么也不应让他们去进军事学校。今天当然首先要满足国防建设的需要，但同时还要照顾其他建设工作的需要，还要使学校的教育工作和工厂的生产工作，仍能正常地进行和发展。有人以为这次军事干部学校招收学生，将不惜使许多学校、工厂蒙受严重影响，甚至会使某些学校关门，这是一种误解。一方面，我们新民主主义的经济工作和教育工作，是应当为国防建设服务的；另一方面，加强国防建设，又正是为了要保障我国经济建设和文化建设的繁荣发展，不受敌人侵犯和破坏。国防建设和经济建设，文化建设之间的关系，是相辅而不是相对立的。
  四、未参加的人应该采取什么态度
    中国广大青年学生、青年工人为巩固国防而参加军事干部学校，这是我国又一次伟大的青年爱国运动。报名参加军事干部学校的青年们，他们用实际行动响应了祖国的号召，是这次青年爱国运动的最积极的参加者。其他没有参加军事干部学校的青年们，也应当用另外的方式来参加这次爱国运动，表现中国青年的爱国主义的精神。
    首先，对于参加军事干部学校的同学或工友们，应当发扬团结友爱的精神，对他们进行热烈的慰问和欢送。他们坚决地走上保家卫国的光荣岗位，应该受到大家尊重。各学校、工厂应根据具体情况，通过座谈会、欢送会等各种形式的活动，来加强自己的团结互助，对参加军事干部学校的同志们的家属如有困难者，应大家帮助解决，并使他们得到精神上的安慰和鼓励，能够积极愉快地走上新的岗位。
    其次，这次没有参加军事干部学校的学生和青年工人，今后应当更加关心政治，关心国家大事，加强时事政治的学习，加强爱国主义和国际主义的教育，随时准备响应祖国的号召，为祖国服务。
    最后，留在学校的学生更要努力学习，留在工厂的工人更要努力生产。青年们要善于把爱国热情和实际行动结合起来，在经常的学习和生产的岗位上，发挥自己爱国主义的精神。
    但有一种态度是要反对的，那就是对于这次加强国防建设的青年爱国运动不是采取赞助拥护的态度，而是采取冷嘲热讽、对立和反对的态度。对这样一个伟大的爱国运动漠不关心，或者对参加的人采取歧视、讽刺、甚至打击破坏的态度，这不但是一种落后的表现，而且是违反国家和人民的利益，有背中国人民的爱国公德。如果这是由于幼稚无知，应该对他们进行很好的说服教育，如果这是有少数坏分子在暗中挑拨和破坏，则应对这些坏分子加以揭发和打击。
    另外，参加军事干部学校的人对不参加的人，当然也绝不应当有骄傲或讽刺的态度。多数人是因为工作需要、身体不好、或另有其他正当原因而未参加，他们的爱国心并不一定比人落后，即使有些人是由于认识不足，决心不够，也不应对他们采取讽刺、打击态度，而仍应热诚相待，很好地帮助他们进步，今天他们的觉悟程度虽还不高，但明天也许就进步了。我们相信在共产党和人民政府的领导、教育下，每个青年都能逐渐地进步，都可能成为对革命有贡献的人。
