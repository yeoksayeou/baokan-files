    Hebei Provincial People's Court Revokes Original Judgment of Zhengding County Government
    Changes Sentence of Local Bully and Landlord Fang Luoyu to Death Penalty
Editor:
    The People's Daily published Comrade Jiang Long's letter on October 14th, criticizing the Shijiazhuang Special District People's Court and the Zhengding County People's Government for carelessly handling the case of landlord Fang Luoyu murdering a revolutionary cadre. The case has now been retried by the Hebei Provincial People's Court, and Fang Luoyu has been sentenced to death. The criminal was executed by firing squad in Zhengding on November 27th. The circumstances surrounding the Fang Luoyu case and its handling are as follows:
    Landlord Fang Luoyu relied on feudal forces in the past (his eldest son, Fang Mingting, served as the Kuomintang's township head, and his second son, Fang Baidan, joined the Kuomintang army) to oppress the masses. After liberation, he still refused to yield. In June of last year, Fang Luoqiu's daughter (16 years old) was cutting grass in his sorghum field, and Fang Luoyu raped her. Relying on his son Fang Heigou, who had infiltrated our army, he threatened the peasants and carried out counter-settlements. The masses were very afraid of him. For example, Fang Xilin, who had been allocated a donkey, returned it to the village office after only a few days of use, and his nephew (Fang Hongchun, a village civil affairs committee member) returned it to him. He also seized back the large cart that had been confiscated from him. Last year, when Fang Heigou took leave to return home for his wedding, Fang Luoyu took the opportunity to demand the return of the tables and benches that had been confiscated from the village head Kang Yuhuan (a Communist Party member). The village head sternly refused, and Fang Luoyu harbored resentment as a result. On July 6th, Fang Luoyu and Fang Heigou went together to find the militia squad leader Fang Lv to demand the fruits that the masses had already obtained, but they couldn't find him, so they immediately went to find the village head Kang Yuhuan. At that time, Fang Heigou was walking in front with a carrying pole and sickle, and Fang Luoyu led his fourth son, Huzi, and grandson, Fang Shuan, following behind, loudly cursing the village head, shouting, "I'll pay with my life if I beat someone to death!" When they arrived at the village head's home, they started fighting after only a few words. Fang Heigou first hit the village head on the head with the carrying pole, causing a deep wound with profuse bleeding. Fang Luoyu hit the village head's right arm with a wooden stool. At the same time, the village head's wife had a front tooth knocked out by Fang Luoyu, and the girl's head was also swollen. After being injured, the village head died due to excessive blood loss, physical weakness, and being forced to pull a cart of soybeans before her injuries had healed, which caused further injury and death. Because of Fang Luoyu's high reactionary arrogance, for more than a year, no one in the village dared to serve as village head again.
    This case had already been sentenced by the Zhengding County Judicial Section to six months imprisonment for Fang Luoyu and four years imprisonment for Fang Heigou, but Fang Luoyu was released on bail by his family members after bribing village cadres in less than two months. After that, the Fang's criminal arrogance became even more rampant. The victim's family then appealed to the Shijiazhuang Branch Court, but the branch court settled the matter amicably. After Comrade Jiang Long's accusation, it was discovered that the original judgment had a major error. The Hebei Provincial People's Court re-examined the case and held that the landlord Fang Luoyu's reactionary behavior not only endangered the village head's life but also undermined our village government, causing no one in the village to dare to be the village head for more than a year. The masses generally reflected, "With Fang Luoyu around, whoever becomes the village head will be unlucky!" If such an unrepentant counter-revolutionary element is not severely suppressed, it will cause significant harm to the revolution. Therefore, in accordance with the State Council and the Supreme People's Court's instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, the original judgment was revoked, and Fang Luoyu was sentenced to death; Fang Heigou directly contributed to his father's ferocity, and his original sentence of four years imprisonment was changed to seven years imprisonment. The remaining judgments regarding funeral expenses of 400 catties of millet, compensation of two mu of land, and the return of counter-settlements were all upheld. Local bully and landlord Fang Luoyu was executed by firing squad in Zhengding City on November 27th.

### 河北省人民法院撤销正定县府原判  改处恶霸地主房洛雨死刑

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    河北省人民法院撤销正定县府原判
    改处恶霸地主房洛雨死刑编辑同志：
    十月十四日人民日报发表江龙同志的信，批评石家庄专区人民法院及正定县人民政府马虎处理地主房洛雨杀害革命干部的事。该案现经河北省人民法院改处房洛雨死刑，该犯已于十一月二十七日在正定枪决。房犯案件发生及处理经过是这样的：
    地主房洛雨，过去即依靠封建势力（其长子房明亭，充任蒋匪大乡乡长，次子房白旦参加将匪军）欺压群众。解放后仍不低头，去年六月间，房洛秋的女儿（十六岁）在他高粱地里割草，房洛雨强奸了她。他依仗儿子房黑狗混入我军，便威胁农民，实行倒算。群众很怕他，如房希林分得毛驴一头，仅使用数天又送到村公所，由他侄儿（房红春，村民政委员）交还他。没收他的大车他也夺回去。去年房黑狗请假回家结婚，房洛雨借势向村长康玉环（共产党员）要回被斗出的桌几，村长严词拒绝，因此房洛雨怀恨在心。七月初六，房洛雨、房黑狗共同去找民兵中队长房驴去要群众已得果实，没有找着，立即去找村长康玉环。那时，房黑狗拿着扁担、镰刀在前头走，房洛雨率领他的四子虎子、孙子房栓随在后面大声谩骂村长，口称：“打死人我偿命！”到了村长家里，几句话就动起手来。房黑狗首先用扁担猛向村长头上打去，打成一条很深的伤口，血流不止；房洛雨用木凳打伤村长右膀；同时村长妻子的门牙也被房洛雨打掉，女孩子头部也被打肿。村长负伤后，因流血过多，身体衰弱，又因生活所迫，未待伤愈，又套车拉豆子，因无力遭车一压，再伤而死。由于房洛雨的反动气焰很高，一年多时间，该村竟无人再敢出任村长。
    这个案件，早由正定县司法科将房洛雨判处半年徒刑，房黑狗四年徒刑，但房洛雨经押未及两月，即由该犯家属贿赂村干部保释。此后房犯凶焰更为嚣张。被害家属遂上诉石家庄分院，但分院和解了事。经江龙同志控告，始发现原判决有重大错误。河北省人民法院重新处理，认为地主房洛雨的反动行为，不仅危及村长生命，并破坏了我村政权，使该村年余没人敢当村长。群众普遍反映：“房洛雨在，谁当村长谁倒霉！”似此怙恶不悛的反革命分子若不严予镇压，将给革命以重大危害，因此依据政务院及最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示，将原判撤销，改处房洛雨死刑；房黑狗直接助长其父凶焰，由原判四年徒刑改处七年徒刑。其余所判之丧葬费小米四百斤，抚恤费地两亩及应退回倒算所得等，均予维持。恶霸地主房洛雨已于十一月二十七日在正定城执行枪决。
