Why Did Jianxing Construction Factory Fire Me?
To the Editor:
	I am a construction worker. I was hired as a temporary carpenter by Zhang Shirong, the manager of Jianxing Construction Factory, on July 3rd. The client was the Anti-epidemic Headquarters at No. 5 Yingzi Hutong, Chongwai. At that time, I discovered that the contractor was secretly sawing off and transporting away the old yellow pine wood used for the purlin square logs, purlins, and battens used to support the beams in the house. It was estimated that there were over thirty rooms worth, a total of more than three hundred pieces, worth several tens of millions of yuan. Because I had received education from the trade union after liberation, I knew that the state's property is our workers' own. This kind of theft by the contractor not only caused losses to state property but also shortened the lifespan of the house, which could lead to the house collapsing and injuring people. Every conscious worker cannot ignore this kind of behavior and immediately made suggestions to the manager. However, Manager Zhang not only didn't listen but transferred me to another place. That evening, I reported the contractor's theft to the Tenth District Trade Union Office (now the Seventh District Trade Union Office), but I was fired two days later. I then reported this matter to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions through the Seventh District Trade Union Office. The comrades of the Beijing Construction Workers' Union notified Chief Wang of the General Affairs Section of the Anti-epidemic Headquarters, but the client not only did not deal with the matter but said that my report was inaccurate and that I should be educated. The comrades of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions then reported this matter to the relevant departments. After investigation, it was proved that my report was true. The client then proposed to deal with it after the project was completed, but now that the project is completed, it has not been dealt with. I don't understand the reason, please help me solve it.

Editor's Note: Comrade Li Yuliang actively protected state property and exposed the illegal behavior of the contractor of Jianxing Construction Factory in Beijing, who stole equipment and endangered national construction. This is a manifestation of the increased awareness of the workers and should be commended. Manager Zhang Shirong of Jianxing Construction Factory did not correct his mistakes but instead fired Li Yuliang. This shows that Zhang Shirong stubbornly disregarded state laws and should be sanctioned by law. The Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Central Anti-epidemic Headquarters adopted a bureaucratic attitude and ignored the workers' opinions without any reason. Furthermore, the Seventh District Trade Union in Beijing disregarded the workers' opinions and did not actively support the workers, which led to the problem being delayed for five months without being resolved. These behaviors should all be deeply examined. Only by correctly and timely handling these negative phenomena, as well as seriously and publicly exposing errors and practicing criticism and self-criticism, can we unite the broad masses of working people to more actively supervise the country's construction undertakings and enable the working class to exert a high degree of wisdom and initiative in participating in the country's construction work.

### 建兴营造厂为什么解雇我？

    建兴营造厂为什么解雇我？
    编辑同志：
    我是一个建筑工人。在七月三日被建兴营造厂经理张士荣雇用作临时木工。业主是崇外英子胡同五号防疫总队。当时我发现包工人将该房内撑梁用的遂柁方子、檩方、佃板（老黄松木）偷偷锯下运走，约计三十余间，共三百多根，价值数千万元。因为我在解放以后受过工会的教育，知道国家的财产就是我们工人自己的。包工人这种偷盗行为，不仅使国家财产受到损失，而且缩减了房子的寿命，会使房塌而伤害人命的。我们每一个有觉悟的工人见到这种行为不能置之不理，当即向经理提出了建议。但张经理不但不听，反而将我调到别处。当晚我将包工人偷盗行为反映到十区工会办事处（现在的七区工会办事处），但两天后就把我解雇了。我又经七区工会办事处将此事反映到市总工会，经北京市建业工会同志通知业主防疫总队总务科王科长，但业主不但不处理此事，反而说我反映不确，应当受教育。市总工会同志乃将此事反映到有关部门，经调查证明我反映的情况是真实的。业主乃提出等工程完后再作处理，现在工程也完了，却并未处理。我不了解什么原因，请贵报帮助解决。
              建筑工人  李玉良
    编者按：李玉良工友积极保护国家财产，揭发京市建兴营造厂包工人偷盗器材危害国家建筑的不法行为，是工人觉悟已经提高的表现，是应当表扬的。建兴营造厂经理张士荣对此不知改过，反将李玉良解雇，这说明张士荣顽固地漠视国家法律，是应当受到法律制裁的。中央防疫总队总务科长采取官僚主义的态度，对工人的意见毫无理由地置之不理，以及京市七区工会漠视工人意见，未积极支持工人，因而使问题拖延了五月尚未解决，这都应当深刻检讨的。只有正确地适时地处理这些不良现象，以及严肃地公开地揭发错误，实行批评与自我批评，才能团结广大劳动人民更积极地起来监督国家的建设事业，也才能使工人阶级在参加国家建设的工作中发挥高度的智慧和积极性。
