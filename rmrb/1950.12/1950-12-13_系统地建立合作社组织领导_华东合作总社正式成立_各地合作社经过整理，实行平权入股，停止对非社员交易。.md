Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th—In order to implement the basic spirit of the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference, systematically establish organizational leadership, and put cooperatives further on the right track, the East China Cooperative General Association was formally established on November 24th.

Under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels and the people's governments at all levels, cooperatives in various parts of East China had organized more than 13,000 grassroots cooperatives by the end of September, with 5,970,000 members, 56.5 billion yuan in share capital, and 757 cooperative societies and general associations above the district level. The total purchase and sales amount in the first three quarters of this year reached 1,397.4 billion yuan, helping members reduce the feudal exploitation they suffered and partially meeting their needs for means of production and livelihood.

Since the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference, cooperatives in various parts of East China have begun to reorganize and register in accordance with the spirit of the conference and the reorganization plan promulgated by the East China Cooperative Enterprise Administration Bureau. According to incomplete statistics, cooperatives that have been reorganized and meet the spirit and requirements of the National Cooperative Conference resolution already number 2,700 in Shandong, 300 in Northern Jiangsu, 44 in Southern Jiangsu, and 32 in Nanjing. They implement equal shareholding, cease transactions with non-members, and establish grassroots societies centered on market towns. There has also been significant development in business, such as the Siyang County Industry-Agriculture Cooperative in Northern Jiangsu, whose transaction volume per market day used to be only 700,000 yuan, but has now increased to 7 million yuan. The number of people in grassroots societies in various districts and villages of the county has also increased by more than 70% compared to before the reorganization.

    系统地建立合作社组织领导
    华东合作总社正式成立 
    各地合作社经过整理，实行平权入股，停止对非社员交易。
    【新华社上海十日电】为贯彻全国合作社工作者代表会议的基本精神，系统地建立组织领导，使合作社进一步走上正轨，华东区合作总社已在十一月二十四日宣告成立。
    华东区各地合作社在中国共产党各级党委和各级人民政府的领导和帮助下，截至九月底止，全区已组织了基层合作社一万三千多个，社员五百九十七万人，股金五百六十五亿元，区以上合作社和总社七百五十七处，今年购销总额到第三季度末达一万三千九百七十四亿元，帮助社员减轻了所受的封建剥削，并且部分地满足了社员的生产和生活资料的需要。
    华东区各地合作社从全国合作社工作者代表会议以来，就根据会议精神和华东区合作事业管理局所颁布的整理方案，着手整理、登记。根据不完全统计，经整理后已经符合全国合作会议决议的精神和要求的合作社，在山东已有二千七百社，苏北三百社，苏南四十四社，南京三十二社。他们实行平权入股，停止对非社员交易，以集镇为中心建立基层社。业务方面也有显著发展，如苏北泗阳县工农合作社，过去每集交易额只七十万元，现在已经增加到七百万元。该县各区、村基层社人数也比整理前增加百分之七十以上。
