    Beijing People Warmly Console Chinese and Korean People's Soldiers
    Large Quantities of Consolation Goods and Letters to be Shipped to the Korean Front
    [Our Newspaper News] Our reporter Lin Hong reports: The donation movement of people from all walks of life in Beijing to warmly comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers Against America and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army has achieved great success. Various units have successively sent large quantities of consolation goods and letters of sympathy to the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression. They are currently being packed and will be shipped to the Korean front in the coming days. According to preliminary statistics from the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the consolation goods and letters submitted to the committee by various organizations, groups, and people from all walks of life include: 110,000 letters of sympathy, 58,000 consolation bags, 18,817 bars of soap, 1,574 dozens and 5 bags of toothpaste, 652 dozens of toothbrushes, 662 dozens of socks, and a large number of daily necessities such as towels, gloves, cotton clothing, fleece underwear, fleece pants, masks, woolen sweaters, matches, cigarettes, books, magazines, diaries, pencils, fountain pens, raincoats, goggles, harmonicas, and flashlights. The bank has collected 880,071,875 yuan in People's currency as consolation money.
    Because this consolation movement has spread to every corner of the city, the quantity of consolation goods is very large and the variety is diverse. In order to facilitate collection and sorting so that they can be delivered to the hands of the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers as soon as possible, the committee convened a meeting of representatives from various units to discuss and decide on methods for collecting and packing the consolation goods: First, one wooden box should contain consolation goods and letters from multiple units; second, every ten consolation bags and every ten letters of sympathy should be bundled into a small package; third, daily necessities should be bundled into small packages by the dozen. All of these methods are for the convenience of distribution at the front. Almost all units can follow this method, which has saved the committee a lot of manpower and material resources. Since the beginning of the centralization of consolation goods, all the staff of the committee have participated in the counting and packing work, working from morning to night every day. However, due to the limited manpower of the committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Municipal Student Federation, the Public Security Bureau, and the Transportation Workers' Union have all taken turns sending people to participate in this work. As a result of several days of effort, most of the consolation goods and letters have been packed, with a total of 250 large wooden boxes filled with consolation bags, six large wooden boxes filled with letters of sympathy, more than 90 small wooden boxes and 121 packages filled with other daily necessities. The committee has decided to complete the packaging of all items on the 22nd and send them to the Korean front. All Beijing organizations and groups that have not yet submitted consolation goods to the committee must send them before the 21st of this month (No. 2, Zhengyi Road, Dongjiaominxiang). Collection will be stopped after the deadline, and the units will keep them themselves for disposal.

    京市人民热烈慰劳中朝人民战士            
    大批慰劳物品信件即运朝鲜前线
    【本报讯】本报记者林洪报道：京市各界人民热烈慰劳中国人民抗美援朝志愿军和朝鲜人民军的捐献运动已获巨大成绩，各单位已陆续将大批慰劳品和慰问信送交中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京分会。现正装箱打包，日内即将运往朝鲜前线。据中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京分会初步统计，各机关、团体和各界人民已送交该会的慰劳品及信件，计：慰问信十一万封、慰劳袋五万八千个、肥皂一万八千八百一十七条、牙粉一千五百七十四打零五袋、牙刷六百五十二打、袜子六百六十二打，另有大批毛巾、手套、棉衣裤、绒衣、绒裤、口罩、毛线衣、火柴、香烟、书籍、杂志、日记本、铅笔、钢笔、雨衣、风镜、口琴及手电筒等日用品；银行代收慰劳品代金人民币八亿八千万零七万一千八百七十五元。
    因为这一次的慰劳运动遍及全市各个角落，慰劳品的数量十分巨大，种类繁多，为便于收集和整理，以便早日送到中朝人民战士的手中，该会曾召集各单位的代表开了一次会，讨论决定了慰劳品收集和装箱的办法：第一、一个木箱里面应多装几个单位的慰劳品和信件，第二、每十个慰劳袋和每十封慰问信分别捆成一小包，第三、日用品以打为单位捆成一小包。所有这些办法，全是为了便于前线分发。各单位差不多都能按照这一办法进行，使该会节省了不少人力和物力。自开始集中慰劳品以来，该会全部工作人员都参加了清点和装箱等工作，每日从早忙到晚。但因该会人力有限，市总工会、市妇联、市学联、公安局和搬运工会等单位，均曾轮流派人前来参加这一工作。经几天努力的结果，大部分慰劳品及信件均已装箱打包，计慰劳袋共装了二百五十个大木箱，慰问信装了六个大木箱，其他日用品共装了九十多个小木箱和一百二十一个包裹。该会决定将全部物品于二十二日包装完毕，送往朝鲜前线；凡京市各机关团体尚未将慰劳物品送交该会者，务于本月二十一日前送到（东交民巷正义路二号），逾期即停止收集，由各单位自己保存听候处理。
