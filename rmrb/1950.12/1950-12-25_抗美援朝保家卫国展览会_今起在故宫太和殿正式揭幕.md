    Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea, Protect-Our-Homes and Defend-the-Nation Exhibition
    Officially Opens Today at the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City
    The Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea, Protect-Our-Homes and Defend-the-Nation Exhibition, organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, has been prepared after more than a month. Two previews were held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City, and revisions were made based on the opinions put forward by all parties. It is now scheduled to officially open in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City on the 25th of this month. This exhibition has collected many rare pictures and objects from all aspects, especially some precious objects and pictures introduced by the United States regarding the cultural aggression and plunder of our country by American imperialism. These pictures have never been published before, so they are a great help to understanding American imperialism. The content is divided into three parts for display. The first part is: Why we cannot ignore the American imperialist aggression against Korea; including the century-long history of American imperialist aggression against China and the relationship between the people of China and North Korea, who are as closely related as lips and teeth. The second part: The United States is a reactionary, corrupt, and degenerate headquarters. The third part: The world's peaceful and democratic camp is powerful and invincible, and the instigators of war will surely be judged justly. In order to carry out ideological education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and correctly understanding US imperialism, it is hoped that all agencies, schools, and organizations will organize visits to gain a deeper understanding of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the country.

    抗美援朝保家卫国展览会
    今起在故宫太和殿正式揭幕
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会所举办的抗美援朝保家卫国展览会，经过月余的筹备，已布置就绪；日前于故宫太和殿曾举行过两次预展，根据各方提出的意见从新加以修改；兹定于本月二十五日起在故宫太和殿正式揭幕。这次展览会曾向各方面征集了许多平常所罕见的图片与实物；特别是美帝对我国文化侵略与掠夺及美国介绍的一些珍贵实物图片。这些图片是从来没发表过的，故对认识美帝是一个很好的帮助。内容共分三部陈列。第一部分为：我们对美帝侵略朝鲜为什么不能置之不理；其中包括美帝百年侵华史与中朝两国人民唇齿相依休戚与共的关系；第二部分：美国是反动的腐化堕落的大本营；第三部分：世界和平民主阵营力量强大无敌，战争的煽动者一定受到正义的裁判。为着进行抗美援朝的思想教育与正确的认识美帝，希各机关、学校、团体组织参观，以求对抗美援朝保家卫国有更进一步的认识。
