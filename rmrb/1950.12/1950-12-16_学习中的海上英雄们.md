The victorious Chinese people are unremittingly building their own powerful navy. Our great leader Chairman Mao instructed us: "We must build a navy, a navy that can defend our coasts and effectively defend against possible imperialist aggression." The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, as in its battles, resolutely carries out this wise instruction. In the past year or so, the Chinese People's Navy has established its own fleet, built strong bases on the coastline, and at the same time, built a number of naval schools, and is actively training a large number of new Chinese People's Navy cadres and soldiers.

These modernized naval schools differ in nature according to the technical level and technical business being studied. All these schools are established in accordance with modern requirements. Some schools have been built very well, and some are being accelerated in construction. Each school has adequate library facilities, laboratories dedicated to each course, ships for practice, and experimental factories for internships. The teachers in the school include professors with rich teaching experience and specialized knowledge from famous domestic universities such as Tsinghua, Peking, Beiyang, and Jiaotong, as well as comrades with rich naval science knowledge and sea life experience.

The schools teach students the latest modernized naval science and technology, and students must study various necessary courses. The depth of the courses varies from school to school. Generally, they need to study or review some basic natural science theory courses, and then study some naval specialized courses, such as navigation, engines, guns, communications, and seamanship.

In teaching methods, the naval schools have absorbed the advanced experience of the great socialist Soviet Union and adopted a method that combines theory with practice. The theoretical study in the classroom is closely linked to laboratory and factory experimental operations. After a period of theoretical study, there is a certain amount of time to go to warships and factories for internships, so that students can further master what they have learned. During the internship, students live with workers and soldiers, able to deeply appreciate their thoughts and feelings, so that they can get better exercise and transformation. The students' learning methods are the same as those of general middle and high schools. Three to five people are combined into a group, and individual research is carried out under the collective guidance of the group, and mutual assistance is carried out on the basis of self-study. Every comrade in the group cares for and helps each other with a high sense of political responsibility.

In this way, some excellent learning models have emerged from naval schools. Chen Zhaoxin, who came from the fourth grade of Tsinghua University to study, was elected as a learning model in a naval school, and this October he was selected as a nonvoting delegate to the National Congress of Combat Heroes. One student with only a junior high school education could not keep up with the class at first. Later, with the enthusiastic help and encouragement of the party and comrades, coupled with his own hard work, he caught up with the class in a short time, and these courses were technical courses that required calculus to learn well.

The students of naval schools are all outstanding young people who love the motherland. Some of them are strong revolutionary soldiers and cadres who have been transferred from the People's Liberation Army Army and have been tempered for a long time, and some of them are combat heroes. In addition, there are countless young students from all over the country.

The learning and life of naval schools are carefully arranged according to scientific principles. Students from ordinary schools were initially not used to these lives, but after a short period of training, they slowly became accustomed to them and developed a love for this life.

The life of naval school is tense, but also extremely lively and happy. Every day after class, the school's broadcasting station broadcasts majestic and cheerful music, or explains current affairs. At this time, the students are all immersed in enthusiastic extracurricular activities. On the court and track field, they play together. In the summer, most of them go to the beach and swimming pool to learn to swim, row sampans, and play water games. Every Saturday, each school has an entertainment evening, with programs such as dramas, dances, music, movies, etc. On National Day and other major festivals, the students of the naval schools put on white or sky-blue sailor uniforms and participate in reviews and parades in various places.

The students of the naval schools are studying actively, shouldering the hopes and love of the people of the whole country. They all unanimously hope to master the technology as soon as possible, participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan, and protect the territorial waters of the motherland from the aggression of American imperialism.

    学习中的海上英雄们
    为群
    胜利了的中国人民，正不懈地建设着自己的强大海军。伟大领袖毛主席指示我们：“我们一定要建设一支海军，这支海军要能保卫我们的海防，有效地防御帝国主义的可能的侵略。”英勇的中国人民解放军象它在作战中一样，坚决地执行着这一英明的指示。一年多以来，中国人民海军建立了自己的舰队，建设了位在海防线上的坚强基地，同时，还建设了若干海军学校，正在积极培养着大批的新中国人民海军的干部和战士。
    这些近代化的海军学校，按所学习的技术水平与技术业务而有不同的性质。所有这些学校，都是按照近代化的要求建立的。有的学校已经建设得很完备，有的则正在加速建设中。各个学校都有充分的图书设备，有各课程专用的实验室，有实习用的舰艇，还有实验工厂供实习。在校任教的教员，有国内各著名大学如清华、北大、北洋、交大等校的具有丰富教学经验和专门知识的教授，有和助教具有丰富海军科学知识和海上生活经验的同志。
    学校以最新的近代化的海军科学和技术教授学员，学员都要学习各种必要的课程。课程的深浅各校不同，一般地要学习或复习一些基本的自然科学理论课程，以后再学习一些海军的专门课程，如航海、轮机、枪炮、通讯、船艺等。
    在教学的方法上，海军学校吸取了伟大的社会主义苏联的先进经验，采取理论与实际相结合的方法。课堂上的理论学习紧紧结合着实验室以及工厂的实验作业，理论课学习告一段落后，有一定的时间到军舰上和工厂里去实习，以便使学员们把所学的理论进一步求得掌握。在实习时，学员和工人战士生活在一起，能够深深地体会他们的思想感情，使自己得到更好的锻炼和改造。学员的学习方法，和一般大中学的相同，三五人结合为一小组，在小组的集体指导下进行个人的钻研，又在自学的基础上进行互相帮助，小组里的每一个同志，都以高度的政治责任感彼此关心着和帮助着。
    这样，海军学校曾涌现出了一些优秀的学习模范。从清华大学四年级来学习的陈沼炘，在一个海军学校里当选了学习模范，今年十月他被推选为全国战斗英雄代表会议的列席代表。有一个文化程度仅及初二的学员，起初赶不上课，后来在上级党和同志们热情的帮助鼓舞下，加上他自己的苦心钻研，在不长的时间中，便跟上了课，而这些课程是必须学过微积分的才能学好的技术课程。
    海军学校的学员都是热爱祖国的优秀青年。他们有的是从人民解放军陆军中调来的久经锻炼的坚强的革命战士和干部，其中有的则是战斗英雄。此外，还有着无数的来自各地的青年学生。
    海军学校的学习和生活，是按照科学原则作了精细安排的。由普通学校来的同学们，起初对于这些生活有些不习惯，经过短时间的锻炼，便慢慢习惯了，而且对这种生活发生了热爱。
    海军学校的生活是紧张的，同时又是极其活泼愉快的。每天课余的时间，学校的广播台播送着雄壮愉快的音乐，或者讲解着时事，这时学员们便都投入热烈的课外活动中了，球场上，田径场上，玩成一片；夏天则大部分去海滩和游泳池，学游泳，荡舢板，作水中游戏。每星期六各校有文娱晚会，节目有话剧、舞蹈、音乐、电影等等，在国庆日及其他大的节日，海军学校的学员们穿上了洁白的或者天蓝呢的水兵服，参加各地的检阅和游行。
    海军学校学员们肩负着全国人民的希望和热爱积极学习着。他们都一致希望早日掌握技术，参加解放台湾的战斗，保卫祖国的领海永不受美帝国主义的侵略。
