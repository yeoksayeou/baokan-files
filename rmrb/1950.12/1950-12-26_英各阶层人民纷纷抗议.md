Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: A compilation of TASS and Telepress reports: People of all classes in Britain are protesting against the North Atlantic Group's decision to arm West Germany, demanding a peaceful resolution to the Korean question, and opposing war against China.

An increasing number of British people are firmly opposed to the restoration of the Nazi army and air force. The London Daily Worker published a batch of protest letters on the 20th. Captain Gate, the secretary of the "Veterans Peace Movement," angrily pointed out: "The decision to rearm the Nazis is an insult to our comrades who died in the last war." Former pilot Horne said: "To supply the Germans with tanks and planes again is tantamount to suicide." Mrs. Brilliant, a member of the "Mothers of Enlisted Soldiers Committee," said: "This is simply a disgrace. Have those politicians ever thought of the mothers who suffered terribly during the horrible war years? Those politicians once told us that the Nazis were the embodiment of all evils, but today they want us to believe that the Nazis have become 'defenders of freedom'." The Daily Worker published photographs of Nazi Germany's blitz on London on the 20th, reminding people of the terrible scenes that could happen again. The newspaper's editorial pointed out: "The decision to rebuild the German army and air force, which everyone hates, is the most shameless betrayal of the British people... The British people should have a better future than the one arranged for them by this shameful conspiracy."

The British people's growing dissatisfaction and fear of the Labor government's policy of hostility towards the Soviet Union and preparation for a war of aggression is also reflected in letters written to members of Parliament. Labor MP Harold Davis received many letters from his constituents. A letter from Rochdale asked: "Does the cabinet fully recognize the boiling indignation felt by ordinary people at the deterioration of our relations with some of our wartime allies?" A group of workers wrote: "We are certainly not politicians, but we feel that our country has no reason or justification to be an enemy of the Soviet Union." A headmaster from Kent wrote: "Parents here who once had confidence in the Labor government... are now suffering from fear and misplaced trust."

On the 20th, youth from the Labor Party, Communist Party, and Conservative Party in the Holborn and St. Pancras districts of London held a joint conference and unanimously resolved to demand a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and all outstanding issues between the major powers.

A group of workers at the Bedford Automobile Company and the London Southwest Electrical Trade Union branch separately demanded, in telegrams to Prime Minister Attlee and resolutions passed, that the Korean War be stopped, that all foreign troops be withdrawn, and that the People's Republic of China be allowed to enter the United Nations. They also solemnly stated: "We will never fight against China." The East Grinstead Labor Party Committee also demanded that the Labor government not be involved in a war against China.

    英各阶层人民纷纷抗议
    【新华社二十五日讯】综合塔斯社及电通社消息：英国各阶层人民纷纷抗议北大西洋集团武装西德的决定，并要求和平解决朝鲜问题，反对对中国作战。
    愈来愈多的英国人民坚决反对恢复纳粹陆空军。伦敦工人日报二十日发表了一批抗议函件。——“退伍军人和平运动”的总书记盖特上尉愤怒指出：“重新武装纳粹的决定，侮辱了我们在上次大战中死去的同志。”前飞行员霍恩说：“再供给德国人坦克和飞机，无异自杀。”“入伍士兵母亲委员会”委员布里利安特夫人说：“这简直是奇耻大辱。那些政客们是否也曾想到过在可怖的战争年月中痛苦不堪的母亲们？那些政客们曾告诉我们：纳粹分子是一切祸害的化身，今天他们却要我们相信：纳粹分子已成为‘自由保卫者’了。”工人日报二十日刊载纳粹德国闪击伦敦的照片，提醒人民可能再度发生的可怖的景象。该报社论指出：“重建人人憎恨的德国陆空军的决定，是最无耻的叛卖英国人民的行为……英国人民应该享有比这可耻的阴谋为他们所安排下的前途更好的东西。”
    英国人民对工党政府敌视苏联准备侵略战争的政策日益增加的不满和恐惧也反映在写给议员们的信件中。工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯收到他的选民寄来的许多信件。从洛奇达尔来的一封信问道：“内阁是否充分认识到老百姓对我们与若干我们的战时盟国之间关系恶化的现象已感到沸腾的愤慨了呢？”一群工人写道：“我们固然不是政治家，但是我们觉得我国没有任何原故或理由做苏联的敌人。”肯特郡的一位校长写道：“这里曾对工党政府有过信任的父母们……现在正为恐惧与错误的信任而苦恼了。”
    二十日伦敦荷尔波恩和圣潘克拉斯区的工党、共产党和保守党的青年举行联合大会，一致决议要求和平解决朝鲜问题以及各大国间所有未决的问题。
    裴德福汽车公司的一群工人和伦敦西南部电气工会分会分别在给首相艾德礼的电报和通过的决议中要求停止朝鲜战争，撤退一切外国军队，允许中华人民共和国进入联合国。他们并一致郑重表示：“我们决不对中国作战。”东格伦斯特德工党委员会也要求工党政府不要卷入对中国的战争。
