    More Than 180 Factories and Mines Complete Annual Production Ahead of Schedule
    On the eve of the New Year, good news of production is spreading from all over the country in the patriotic production competition. According to reports from various places, more than 180 state-owned industrial and mining enterprises across the country have completed or exceeded their annual production tasks ahead of schedule. Among them, there are 91 in the Northeast, 36 in North China, 42 in East China, and 17 in Central South, Northwest, and Southwest China.
    Among these industrial and mining enterprises that have completed their production plans, the national railways' revenue freight transportation task was completed ahead of schedule on the 18th of this month. Most of the national cotton textile factories completed and exceeded their annual production plans one month ahead of schedule. Coal mines in the Northeast region and non-ferrous metals, cement, and other products in the Central South region have also completed their production plans ahead of schedule. At the same time, the quality of various products has improved compared to the past, and costs have also been reduced. For example, the qualified product rate of the Northeast State-owned Rubber Factory No. 4 has reached more than 99%; the first-class product rate of a certain electrical repair factory has increased from 87.23% to 97.7%. The actual cost of each light bulb at the Dalian Light Bulb Factory has been reduced by an average of more than 25% compared to the planned cost, and other factories have also reduced costs compared to the past.
    The achievement of the above results is the result of the efforts of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in various regions to improve their business management, organize the broad masses of workers to participate in production competitions, and the assistance of Soviet experts over the past year.
    After February of this year, industrial and mining enterprises in various parts of the country gradually established factory management committees and implemented democratic management. In the coal mining, transportation, construction and other industrial sectors, the feudal "ba tou" (foreman) system was abolished, which greatly enhanced the workers' sense of ownership and gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 64,000 workers have created new production records individually or collectively in the past year. Many workers have also put forward thousands of rationalization proposals, saving a lot of wealth for the country. Among them, the improvement of the pulverized coal equipment and the overcoming of pulverized coal leakage proposed by the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant alone can save the country 1,143,400 kilograms of millet every year.
    In completing the annual production plan, the organization and leadership of trade unions at all levels across the country in launching production competition movements among the broad masses of workers has played a huge role. As of October this year, the number of trade union members nationwide was close to 5 million, reaching about 45% of the total number of employees nationwide. In the railway, machinery manufacturing, electricity, hardware smelting, textile and other industrial sectors, the number of members has reached more than 80% of the total number of employees. In order to better organize production competitions, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held two production conferences in February and May this year, emphasizing that the production competition movement is the regular working and living style of the working class in the future. In this way, on the eve of the "May Day," "July 1st," and National Day holidays, workers in various places enthusiastically launched production competition movements. Especially the patriotic production competition launched recently in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the country has spread to all parts of the country. The number of participants is unprecedentedly wide. In Shenyang, according to statistics in early December, the number of participating employees reached 87% of the total number of employees in the city, and technical personnel also reached 84% of the total number. In this way, many factories completed or exceeded their annual production plans ahead of schedule.
    The help of Soviet experts is also one of the important reasons why state-owned enterprises in some departments have completed or exceeded their production plans ahead of schedule. In the coal mining industry, due to the acceptance of Soviet experts' experience and the realization of the reform of coal mining methods, the recovery rate of thick coal seams has increased from 65% to 85%, and the life of mines can be extended by one time compared with the past. In the electricity industry, the implementation of vigorously opening up electricity, adjusting loads, strengthening maintenance, and implementing safe power supply has enabled the equipment utilization rate to increase from 24.2% last year to 28.3% this year; the equipment power generation capacity has increased from 65% last year to 78.8% this year. Shijingshan, Fengshan, and other places have reached 100%. In the heavy industry, textile, food and other industrial sectors, Soviet experts have also provided a lot of help, enabling some factories and mines to complete or exceed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. Now, the completion of these production plans by state-owned factories and mines has laid a better foundation for the recovery and development of production next year.

    百八十余厂矿提前完成全年生产
    新年前夕，爱国主义生产竞赛中，各地生产捷报频传。据各地报道，目前全国国营工矿企业已有一百八十多个单位提前完成或超过了全年生产任务。其中东北九十一个、华北三十六个、华东四十二个以及中南、西北、西南等地的十七个。
    在这些完成生产计划的工矿企业中，全国铁路的营业品运输任务已于本月十八日提前完成。全国棉纺织工厂大都提前了一个月的时间完成并超过了全年生产计划。东北区的煤矿、中南区的有色金属、水泥等产品也已提前完成了生产计划。与此同时，各种产品质量已较前提高，成本亦已降低。例如，东北的国营橡胶四厂的合格品已达到了百分之九十九以上；某电修厂的一等产品则由百分之八十七点二三增加到百分之九十七点七。大连灯泡厂每个灯泡的实际成本平均较计划成本降低了百分之二十五以上，其他各厂也已较前降低。
    上述成绩的获得，是一年来各地国营工矿企业部门努力改善经营管理工作、组织了广大工人群众参加生产竞赛，以及苏联专家帮助的结果。
    今年二月以后，全国各地工矿企业部门大都逐步建立了工厂管理委员会，实行了管理民主化。在煤矿、搬运、建筑等产业部门中并废除了封建的把头制度，从而大大提高了工人们主人翁的感觉和发挥了在生产上的积极性与创造性。据不完全统计，一年来有六万四年多工人已单独地或集体地创造了生产新纪录。许多工人并提出了千百件的合理化建议，为国家节省了不少财富。其中仅石景山发电厂工人所建议的改进煤粉装置、克服跑煤粉现象一事，每年即可为国家节省小米一百一十四万三千四百斤。
    在完成全年的生产计划中，全国各地与各产业工会的组织和领导广大工人群众开展生产竞赛运动，起了巨大的作用。至今年十月止，全国工会会员已近五百万人，达到了全国职工总数的百分之四十五左右。在铁路、机器制造、电业、五金冶炼、纺织等产业部门中，会员人数都达到了全体职工总数的百分之八十以上。为了更好地组织生产竞赛，全国总工会曾在今年二月和五月两次召开了生产会议，着重地指出了生产竞赛运动是今后工人阶级的经常劳动方式和生活方式。这样，在“五一”、“七一”国庆等节日前夕，各地工人都热烈地开展了生产竞赛运动。尤其是最近在抗美援朝、保家卫国运动中所展开的爱国主义生产竞赛，更扩展到了全国各地。参加的人数更是空前广泛。在沈阳，据十二月上旬统计，参加的职工人数就达到了全市职工总数的百分之八十七，技术人员亦达到全体人数的百分之八十四。就是这样，许多工厂提前完成或超过了全年生产计划。
    苏联专家的帮助，也是某些部门国营企业提前完成或超过生产计划的重要原因之一。在煤矿工业方面，由于接受了苏联专家的经验，实现了采煤方法的改革，使厚煤层的回收率由百分之六十五提高到了百分之八十五，矿山寿命并可较前延长一倍。电业方面的实行大力开放电力、调整负荷和加强检修工作、实行安全供电，使设备利用率开始由去年的百分之二十四点二提高到今年的百分之二十八点三；设备发电能力由去年的百分之六十五提高到今年的百分之七十八点八。石景山、凤山等地并达到了百分之百。在重工业、纺织、食品等工业部门中，苏联专家也曾给予了不少的帮助，使一些厂矿提前完成或超过了全年生产计划。现在，国营厂矿这些生产计划的完成，已给明年的恢复与发展生产打下了更好的基础。
