Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th: The people of Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia are enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces in defeating the American aggressors in Korea. Newspapers throughout Bulgaria have published numerous articles and statements reflecting the Bulgarian people's immense joy and their determination to support the Korean people. The Bulgarian Communist Party's organ, "Rabotnichesko Delo" (Workers' Cause), published an article titled "The Chinese People's Volunteer Forces Are Fighting Against American Aggression," stating, "If the Americans expand their aggression in the Far East, they will suffer the same fate as Japanese imperialism." "Otechestven Front" (Fatherland Front) wrote, "The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces strengthens the Korean people's confidence in victory and peace." Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, Damyanov, stated in a speech: "The American and British interventionists should not imagine that they can conquer a people fighting to the death for freedom and national independence. Today, people from all continents and countries have risen to defend the Korean people. The great Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries will not allow the American and British imperialists to arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the people with impunity."

    The working people of Bulgaria unanimously expressed their admiration and support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces. Workers at the Sofia brick factory sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces, stating: "The sons of the great Chinese people, the Volunteer Forces, have made a humane decision to drive the American and British aggressors out of Korea. We are deeply grateful for this decision and are confident that the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces will be able to stop the American and British imperialists' greed for enslaving other people." Farmers of the Rovkiti village cooperative farm in Dobruja made a resolution stating: "The Chinese Volunteer Forces' assistance to Korea is a valuable contribution to the progressive mankind's struggle to defend peace." Printing workers in Sofia have pledged to double production to express their respect for the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces. At the same time, people throughout Bulgaria are actively launching movements to support the Korean people.

    The Czechoslovak Youth League's organ, "Mlada Fronta" (Youth Front), published an editorial on December 3rd titled "Warning to American Imperialists," saying: "The People's Republic of China has righteously condemned American aggression against Korea and Taiwan. The Chinese people are seizing the bloody hands of the aggressors there. The Chinese People's Volunteer Forces have joined their Korean brothers in fighting MacArthur and Syngman Rhee, these bloodthirsty bandits, to defend China's borders. Now, the military losses of the American interventionists have thrown Washington into panic. America's partners in the imperialist bloc now also realize that Washington has gone too far." The newspaper also published a special article commenting on the Korean situation, saying: "Not long ago, the drunken aggressors were still inspecting their spoils of war. When they looked up, they saw the stern eyes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces, and their legs went weak. Only then did they realize for the first time that justice and reason are not as powerless as they had imagined."

    保捷人民无比欢欣
    庆贺我人民志愿军胜利
    对我人民抗美援朝志愿行动表示钦敬深信必能攫住侵略者的血手予以惩罚
    【新华社布拉格六日电】保、捷两国人民热烈庆贺中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜击溃美国侵略军的伟大胜利。保加利亚全国各地的报纸刊载了许多专文与声明，反映保国人民无比欢欣的心情与支援朝鲜人民的决心。保加利亚共产党机关报工人事业报以《中国人民志愿部队在与美国侵略进行斗争》为题著文称：“如果美国人在远东扩大侵略，他们将遭到日本帝国主义同样的命运。”祖国阵线报写道：“中国人民志愿部队的胜利，加强了朝鲜人民对胜利与和平的信心”。保国副总理、保共中央委员会政治局委员达姆扬诺夫发表谈话称：“美英干涉者不要幻想他们可以征服为自由与民族独立而进行生死斗争的人民。今天为了保卫朝鲜人民，世界各洲与各国的人民都起来了。伟大的中国人民及亚洲其他国家的人民，决不允许美英帝国主义者不受惩罚地任意摆布人民的命运。”
    保加利亚劳动人民一致表示对中国人民志愿部队的钦敬与支持。保京索非亚砖瓦工厂工人致电中国人民志愿部队称：“伟大的中国人民的儿子志愿部队作出了人道的决定，要把美英侵略者逐出朝鲜。我们对此决定深表感激。并深信中国人民志愿部队必能制止美英帝国主义奴役他国人民的贪欲。”多布鲁查的罗夫启蒂兹村合作农场的农民作出决议称：“中国志愿部队的援助朝鲜，是对进步人类保卫和平斗争的有价值的贡献。”索非亚印刷工人已保证加倍增加生产，来表示他们对中国人民志愿部队的敬意。同时，保国各地人民正纷纷展开积极支援朝鲜人民的运动。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报青年阵线报，十二月三日发表题为《对美帝国主义者的警告》的社论说：“中华人民共和国义正词严地谴责了美国对朝鲜和台湾的侵略。中国人民正在那里攫住侵略者的血手。中国人民志愿部队已和朝鲜弟兄们并肩地对麦克阿瑟和李承晚这批嗜血的匪徒作战，以保卫中国的边疆。现在，美国干涉者的军事损失使得华盛顿惊慌失措。帝国主义集团中的美国的同伙现在也认识到华盛顿是走得太远了。”该报并发表评论朝鲜局势的专文称：不久以前，醉熏熏的侵略者还在巡视他们的战利品。等到他抬起头来时，却看到了中国人民志愿部队严厉的眼睛，他们的腿软了。这时他们才第一次认识到正义和公理并不像他们所想像的那样没有力量。
