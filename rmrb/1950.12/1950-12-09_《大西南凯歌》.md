    *Great Southwest Victory Song*
    The film "Great Southwest Victory Song" records how the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in just four months, at lightning speed, annihilated millions of enemy Chiang Kai-shek troops and liberated the southwestern provinces. The Chinese reactionaries, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, like the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, colluded with the American imperialists to attack the people, but ultimately could not escape the crushing blows of the people's giant hands and were doomed to die. This is a portrayal of the American imperialists and Syngman Rhee, who was armed by them.
    "Great Southwest Victory Song" also illustrates that the various ethnic groups and peace-loving people of China are united like a giant rock. The strength of the Chinese people cannot be stopped by anything. Today, the peace-loving people of China and Korea are also united like a giant rock. The American imperialists launched a military adventure of aggression against the people of China and Korea, and will ultimately be crushed to pieces by the iron fists of the people.

    《大西南凯歌》
    影片《大西南凯歌》记载着中国人民解放军在仅仅四个月中，像飞一样的速度，消灭了数百万敌人蒋匪军，解放西南各省。中国的反动派蒋匪帮和朝鲜卖国贼李承晚一样，勾结了美帝进攻人民，但终于逃不了人民的巨掌痛击而归于死亡。这就是美帝和被它所武装了的李承晚的写照。
    《大西南凯歌》还说明了中国的各民族间、各爱好和平的人民，已像巨石一般的团结一致了。中国人民的力量，是没有任何东西可以阻挡的。今天，中朝两国爱好和平的人民，也像巨石一样团结起来了。美帝对于中朝两国人民发动了军事冒险进攻，最后必将被人民的铁拳打得粉身碎骨。
