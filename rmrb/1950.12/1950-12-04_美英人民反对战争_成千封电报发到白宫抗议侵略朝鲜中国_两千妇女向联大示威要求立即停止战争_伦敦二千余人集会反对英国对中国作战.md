Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: TASS, New York, December 2nd: The protest movement against American aggression in Korea and China is growing in the United States, and the call for the United States to seek a peaceful resolution to the Far East crisis has become louder. The Workers' Daily reported that thousands of telegrams demanding peace have been sent to the White House. Many mass organizations have decided to send delegations to Lake Success to call on the United Nations to promote a peaceful settlement in Asia.

The statement of the Committee for Democratic Far Eastern Policy pointed out: "At this critical juncture, it is necessary to strengthen the determination of the American people to demand peace." The statement said: The Korean and Chinese people have not threatened the United States. The "police action" that began five months ago in Korea, more than six thousand miles from our borders, has brought grief to American families. The burden of increased taxes weighs heavily on our people, and hundreds of billions of dollars are being used for destruction, rather than to build the houses, schools, and hospitals that Americans need. The atmosphere of war hysteria has undermined the civil liberties and freedom of speech that Americans cherish.

The Committee for Democratic Far Eastern Policy believes that a peaceful resolution of the Korean War is possible and demands: an end to the war on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, peace negotiations in the United Nations with the participation of representatives of the North Korean People's Government and the People's Republic of China, and the recognition of the Chinese Central People's Government by the United States, allowing it to join the United Nations.

The Maryland Peace Committee declared: Sixty-five prominent figures in Baltimore, mostly pastors and doctors, signed a telegram to Vyshinsky, Wu Xiuquan, representative of the People's Republic of China, Austin, representative of the United States to the Security Council, and representatives of Britain and India, demanding a ceasefire in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: TASS, New York, December 2nd: Two thousand American women, under the leadership of the "American Women for Peace" organization, held a demonstration at the site of the United Nations General Assembly in response to the threat of a new world war and the adventurousness of American aggression in the Far East, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and taking measures to maintain world peace. Hundreds of women came with their children to participate.

Representatives of the "American Women for Peace" organization brought to the United Nations General Assembly site a statement to be given to Austin, the representative of the United States to the United Nations General Assembly, and the delegations of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The statement said: "We American women who are fighting for peace, mothers, wives, and loved ones of those who are fighting in this war, have been demanding for five months that our government and the governments of all countries mediate the dispute arising from the Korean War through the United Nations... We demand an immediate end to the war. As representatives of American women, as mothers of today's children and mothers of children yet to be born, we make this request to all countries."

The "American Women for Peace" delegation also issued a separate statement to the delegation of the People's Republic of China, stating: "We welcome you here today because we hope that your presence will contribute to world peace, which is our greatest concern."

While the leaders of the women's delegation met with representatives of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and presented their views, hundreds of women entered the hall of the Economic and Social Council and organized a rally to defend peace. In this unprecedented mass demonstration in the history of the United Nations, mothers, housewives, and working women unanimously expressed their strong resentment towards the warmongers. An elderly woman said that her son had fought in World War II for three and a half years, and at that time she wished she had twenty sons to dedicate to the war against fascism. She said that she still remembered how Soviet soldiers and American soldiers embraced each other when they met in Europe, and how the whole world hoped that there would be no such war again. However, she said that politicians are concerned with profiteering and not with maintaining peace, and now they are preparing for a new war. She said that the people hate war.

The participants of the conference resolved to visit every delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly and demand that the American government maintain peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: According to TASS, London: The British National Peace Council (which includes forty groups, mainly religious and pacifist in nature), held a mass meeting at Kingsway Hall in London on November 27, attended by more than two thousand people. Martin, the editor of the magazine "New Statesman and Nation," gave a speech stating that it would be a great danger for Britain to be involved in a war against China as an aggressor. The actions taken by China to defend its borders are the minimum measures that any country would take. Martin continued: We should not only recognize the new China, but also try to get along with the Chinese Central People's Government in a friendly manner. We must take the strongest action and declare that we will never be involved in fighting against China. When he spoke of British soldiers participating in the American aggression against Korea, the attendees shouted "Shame!" Martin continued: If this war is going to become a war against China, British soldiers will never stay there.

Labor MP and member of the Labor Party Executive Committee, Drabble, spoke next. He had recently been to Korea as a reporter for "Reynold's News." He recounted the insane atrocities being committed by the Syngman Rhee gang, where people were accused of being communists and executed without trial. Drabble said that a revolution is taking place in Asia, and the Asian people have the right to gain their freedom. When he spoke of British troops fighting in Korea including young men as young as eighteen, the attendees shouted: "Send them home!" Mackenzie, assistant editor of the "New Statesman and Nation" magazine, who had just returned from the United States, also revealed that the United States is brutally trampling on the freedom of the people. The conference finally passed a resolution urging the British government to support the early convening of a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to achieve lasting peace.

    美英人民反对战争
    成千封电报发到白宫抗议侵略朝鲜中国
    两千妇女向联大示威要求立即停止战争
    伦敦二千余人集会反对英国对中国作战
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：反对美国侵略朝鲜和中国的抗议运动正在美国日益增长，要求美国寻求和平解决远东危机的呼声已形高涨。工人日报报道，已有成千封要求和平的电报发到白宫。许多群众团体都决定派遣代表团去成功湖，呼吁联合国在亚洲促进和平解决。
    民主远东政策委员会的声明指出：“当此危急关头，需要增强美国人民要求和平的决心。”声明说：朝鲜人民和中国人民都没有威胁美国。五个月前在我们国境六千余英里以外的朝鲜开始进行的“警察行动”，已经为美国家庭带来悲痛。已经增加的捐税的负担，重重地压在我们人民的肩上，数百亿美元被用来从事毁灭，而不是用来建设美国人需要的房屋、学校、医院。战争歇斯底里的氛围，破坏了美国人所珍视的公民自由和言论自由的权利。
    民主远东政策委员会相信和平解决朝鲜战争是可能的，并要求：在一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的基础上结束战争，在联合国中在北朝鲜人民政府和中华人民共和国代表参加下进行和平谈判，美国承认中国中央人民政府，允许其加入联合国。
    马里兰和平委员会宣称：巴尔的摩六十五位著名人士，大多数是牧师和医生，署名致电维辛斯基、中华人民共和国代表伍修权、美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀以及英国和印度的代表，要求在朝鲜停战。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：在《美国妇女保卫和平》组织领导下的两千名美国妇女，为了答复新世界大战的威胁和美国在远东侵略的冒险，在联合国大会会址所在地举行示威，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，采取措施以保持世界和平。成百的妇女抱着孩子赶来参加。
    “美国妇女保卫和平”组织的代表们，把交给美国出席联合国大会代表奥斯汀和英、法、苏三国代表团的声明带到联合国大会所在地来，声明中说：“我们正在为和平而斗争的美国妇女们，在这次战争中正在作战的人们的母亲们、妻子们和爱人们，五个月来一直在要求我国政府和世界各国政府通过联合国机构调解由朝鲜战事所发生的争执。……我们要求立即停止战争。作为美国妇女的代表们，作为今天儿童的母亲们和还没有诞生的儿童的母亲们，我们向各国提出这一个要求。”
    “美国妇女保卫和平”代表团并向中华人民共和国代表团发表单独的声明，声明中说：“我们欢迎你们今天来到这里，因为我们希望你们的出席对世界和平将有贡献，这是我们最关切的事情。”
    当妇女代表团的领袖们往晤联合国秘书长的代表并提出她们的意见时，数百名妇女们进入了经社理事会的大厅，组织了一次保卫和平的大会。在联合国历史上空前的这个群众示威运动中，母亲们、家庭妇女们和劳动妇女们，一致表示出她们对战争贩子们的强烈愤恨。一位年老妇女说：她的儿子在第二次世界大战中曾经作战了三年半，当时她希望她能够有二十个儿子献给对法西斯主义的战争。她说：她还记得当苏联士兵和美国士兵在欧洲会面的时候，他们怎样的彼此拥抱在一起，全世界又是怎样的希望不再有另一次这样的战争。然而，她说：政客们都关心着牟利，而不关心保持和平，现在他们正在准备着新的战争。她说：人民是痛恨战争的。
    大会的参加者们决议访问出席联合国大会的每一个代表团，并要求美国政府保持和平。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国的全国和平会议（按该会包括四十个主要是宗教与和平主义性质的团体），于十一月二十七日在伦敦金斯威大会堂举行群众大会，到会者二千余人。《新政治家与民族》杂志主笔马丁发表演说称：英国如以侵略者的身份卷入对中国的战争，乃是一大危险。中国为了保卫自己的边疆而采取的行动，是最低限度的措施，这是任何一国都会这样做的。马丁继称：我们不仅应该承认新中国，而且应该设法与中国中央人民政府友好相处。我们必须采取最坚强的行动，声明决不卷入对中国作战。当他说到英国士兵参与美国侵略朝鲜的战争的时候，与会者高呼“可耻！”马丁继称：如果这个战争将要变成对中国的战争，英国的士兵决不留在那里。
    工党议员、工党执行委员会委员德来柏继起发言，他最近曾以《雷诺新闻》记者的身份到过朝鲜。他讲述李承晚匪帮在进行着疯狂的暴行，人民被指控为共产党员后不经审判就被执行枪决。德来柏说：亚洲正在发生一次革命，亚洲人民有权获得他们的自由。当他说到在朝鲜作战的英国军队中有年仅十八岁的青年时，与会者高呼：“把他们遣送回国！”刚从美国回来的《新政治家与民族》杂志助理编辑马肯齐，也揭露了美国正残暴地蹂躏着人民的自由。大会最后通过决议，敦促英国政府支持早日召开四强外长会议，以获致持久的和平。
