    Eliminate the Economic and Cultural Aggressive Forces of American Imperialism in China
    Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government issued an order on the 28th of this month to control and investigate all properties of the U.S. government and U.S. enterprises within China, and to freeze all U.S. public and private deposits in all banks within China. At the 65th meeting of the State Council, the "Report on the Principles for Handling Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies" and the "Decision on the Principles for Handling Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies" by Vice Premier Guo Moruo were also adopted. These measures of the Central People's Government are entirely reasonable and necessary. This is an effective measure to counter the U.S. imperialists' barbaric aggression and hostile acts against our country, and to prevent the U.S. from undermining and endangering the interests of our country and people.
    On the 10th of this month, the U.S. government brazenly announced the control of public and private property of the People's Republic of China within the U.S. jurisdiction and prohibited all ships registered in the U.S. from sailing to Chinese ports. This is a further act of economic plunder of the Chinese people's property by the U.S. imperialists, following their armed invasion of Taiwan, bombing of Northeast China and Shandong, and shelling of our merchant ships. The Chinese people will never recognize the U.S.'s act of plunder, and cannot but take necessary countermeasures. The American property controlled by the Central People's Government mostly belongs to the "investment" of American imperialism in China, which undermined the economic sovereignty of the Chinese people. Since the Opium War, especially after the United States forced the Qing government to sign the "Treaty of Wangxia" in 1844, the United States extended its spearhead of economic aggression into China under the slogan of so-called "equal benefit"; by 1930, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the total amount of U.S. investment in China had reached 240 million U.S. dollars; During the subsequent Kuomintang rule, American monopoly capital continued to pour in in large quantities, completely controlling China's national economy and plunging the vast majority of the Chinese people's lives and national industry and commerce into dire straits. However, the Chinese people finally stood up, and the military and political forces of American imperialism were driven out of mainland China, and its economic control in China was also severely hit. Can the liberated and independent Chinese people still allow the imperialist economic forces in China to continue to undermine the economic life of our people and endanger the interests of our country and people? This is obviously something that our people and the government representing the interests of our people cannot allow!
    The U.S. imperialists, through their economic aggression, exploited the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and also vainly attempted to buy the hearts of the Chinese people with a small portion of the blood and sweat they had extracted from the Chinese people. In order to pave the way for its political, economic, and military aggression, the U.S. imperialists also especially intensified its cultural aggression against China, in an attempt to spiritually numb the Chinese people. Therefore, for a long time, the U.S. imperialists had painstakingly carried out such a bloodless "investment" in China, which is the so-called investment in religious, cultural, and relief undertakings. According to a book called "A Glimpse of Sino-American Relations" written by an American named Julian Arnold and published in 1932, "The total amount of investment in schools, hospitals, etc. established by the United States in China is unmatched by any other foreign investment." It also said: "In the past 100 years, the United States has donated hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars to churches, and dispatched tens of thousands of men and women to engage in church work." The U.S. imperialists used this huge investment to subsidize China's religious, cultural, and relief undertakings, and its purpose was to spiritually strangle the Chinese people through these methods, so that the Chinese people would regard the enemy as a friend and willingly become its slaves. This is the most vicious aggressive policy of American imperialism.
    There is such a robber in the world, who robs your property, and then gives you a few unimportant things, but wants you to treat him as a "benefactor." American imperialism is such a robber, and it has not returned anything to you. Its so-called "return of the Boxer Indemnity" and its "investment" are only in order to spend this little money to "reap more," because it believes that "commercial pursuit of spiritual domination is more reliable than pursuit of military flags."
    For more than a hundred years, American imperialism has invaded China, plundered China, and directly helped Chiang Kai-shek massacre millions of Chinese people. It is said that this is all an expression of its "friendship" with the Chinese people. However, American imperialism thinks that its few bloody and dirty money can really buy the hearts of the Chinese people, which is completely wrong. Austin's shameless slander aroused the anger of patriotic believers, church school students and teachers, and church hospital staff across China, who issued declarations and held demonstrations, and resolutely demanded that these institutions be run by the Chinese people themselves. This is a powerful counterattack against the conspiracy and slander of American imperialism.
    Because the U.S. imperialists' vicious policy of attempting to spiritually enslave the Chinese people has been hit, it has used the method of freezing Chinese property in the United States and cutting off remittances to threaten the lives of personnel in all religious, cultural, and relief organizations that receive U.S. subsidies. But this method of American imperialism cannot threaten the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people can completely rely on their own strength to run these institutions, and they will definitely run them better than before.
    The Central People's Government's order on controlling and investigating American property and freezing American public and private deposits and the "Decision on the Principles for Handling Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies" are completely correct because they represent the just demands of the broad masses of the people. This is a measure that a dignified and independent people's country must take. All patriotic people, including personnel in cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious groups receiving U.S. subsidies, should enthusiastically support this measure, and work hard to implement this measure, and completely eliminate the economic and cultural aggressive forces of American imperialism in our country.

### 肃清美帝在中国的经济和文化侵略势力

    肃清美帝在中国的经济和文化侵略势力
    中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理于本月二十八日发布命令，管制与清查在我国境内的美国政府和美国企业的一切财产，冻结我国境内所有银行的一切美国公私存款；在政务院第六十五次政务会议上又通过了郭沫若副总理“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的报告”和“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”。中央人民政府政务院的这些措施是完全合理的和必要的。这是回击美帝国主义对我国横蛮的侵略和敌视行为，防止美帝破坏与危害我国家人民利益的有效措施。
    美国政府在本月十日悍然宣布管制我中华人民共和国在美国辖区内的公私财产并禁止一切在美注册的船只开到中国港口，这是美帝国主义继其武装侵略我台湾、轰炸我东北、山东、炮击我商船之后，进一步在经济上掠夺中国人民的财产的行为。中国人民决不能承认美国的掠夺行为，并且不能不采取必要的对策。中央人民政府所管制的美国财产，大部分属于美帝国主义在中国的“投资”，这些投资破坏了中国人民的经济主权。从鸦片战争时候起，特别是在一八四四年美国迫使满清政府签订了“中美望厦条约”以后，美国就在所谓“利益均沾”的口号下，向中国伸进了它的经济侵略的矛头；到国民党反动统治时期的一九三○年，美国在中国的投资总额已达二亿四千万美元；在此后的国民党统治时期中，美国独占资本更继续大量涌进，完全控制了中国的国民经济，使中国的广大人民生活以及民族工商业陷于绝境。但是，中国人民终于站起来了，美帝国主义的军事、政治势力就被赶出了中国大陆，它在中国的经济上的控制权也遭受了沉重的打击。解放了的独立的中国人民，难道还能够容许帝国主义在中国的经济势力继续破坏我国人民的经济生活，危害我国家人民的利益吗？这显然是我国人民和代表我国人民利益的政府所决不能容许的！
    美帝国主义者通过其经济侵略，榨取了中国人民的血汗，又妄想用榨取所得的中国人民的血汗的小部分来收买中国的人心。美帝国主义者为了替它的政治、经济、军事侵略铺平道路，还特别加紧了对中国的文化侵略，以图从精神上麻醉中国人民。因此，在很长时期中，美帝国主义者就曾处心积虑对中国进行了这样的一种杀人不见血的“投资”，这就是所谓宗教文化救济事业的投资。据一个名叫居里安·安诺德的美国人所写的在一九三二年出版的《中美关系之蠡测》一书中说：“美国在华创设之学校、医院等，其投资总额为其他任何外侨投资所不及。”又说：“近百年来美国捐助教会之款，达美金数万万元。派遣从事教会事业之男女人员达数万。”美帝国主义者用这笔巨额投资津贴中国的宗教、文化、救济事业，其目的，就是通过这些方式，来在精神上扼杀中国人民，使中国人民认敌为友，而甘愿做它的奴隶。这是美帝国主义的最恶毒的侵略政策。
    世界上有这样一种强盗，他抢夺了你的财产，然后，还给你几件不重要的东西，却要你把他当作“恩人”。美帝国主义就是这样一种强盗，而且它并没有还给你任何东西，它的所谓“退还庚款”，它的这种“投资”，只是为了花这一点钱可以“收获更多”，因为它认为“商业追随精神上的支配是比追随军旗更为可靠”的。
    一百多年来，美帝国主义者侵略了中国，掠夺了中国，并直接帮助蒋介石屠杀了几百万中国人民，据说这都是它对于中国人民的“友谊”的表示。但是，美帝国主义者以为它们的几个染着血腥的肮脏钱真可以收买中国的人心，那是完全错了。奥斯汀的无耻诬蔑，引起了全中国各地具有爱国心的教徒及教会学校学生教员和教会医院人员的愤怒抗议，纷纷发表宣言和举行示威，并坚决要求这些机关由中国人民自办。这是对于美帝国主义的阴谋与诬蔑的有力回击。
    由于美帝国主义者企图在精神上奴役中国人民的恶毒政策遭受了打击，因此它又用冻结中国在美国的财产，断绝汇兑的办法来威胁所有接受美国津贴的宗教、文化、救济团体中的人员的生活。但美帝国主义的这个办法是威胁不了中国人民的。中国人民在中央人民政府的领导之下，完全可以依靠自己的力量来办理这些机关，并且一定会办得比原来更好。
    中央人民政府关于管制清查美国财产冻结美国公私存款的命令和“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”之所以是完全正确的，就因为这是代表了广大人民的正义要求，这是一个尊严独立的人民的国家所必须采取的措施。一切爱国的人民，包括在接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关和宗教团体中的人员，都应该热烈地起来拥护这个措施，并努力实现这个措施，把美帝国主义在我国经济上文化上的侵略势力加以彻底清除。
