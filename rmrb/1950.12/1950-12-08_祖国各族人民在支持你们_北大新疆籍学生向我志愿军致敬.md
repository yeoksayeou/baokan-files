Peking University Xinjiang Students Pay Tribute to Our Volunteer Army

Ten minority students from Xinjiang at Peking University, namely: An Suying (Xibo), An Haoxue (Hui), Mu Shengui (Hui), Ma Mingjun (Hui), Bo Dagong (Manchu), Ma Buqing (Hui), Liu Ruilin (Hui), Wang Lijun (Guihua), Musa (Uyghur), and Halisha (Uzbek), jointly wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, who are fighting against the U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, expressing their deep condolences and support, and extending their highest respect to their heroic fighting spirit. In their letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they said: We are minority youth growing up in the border region of the motherland—Xinjiang. Under the rule of the reactionaries, we suffered all kinds of discrimination and oppression. After liberation, we were fortunate enough to come to Peking University in the people's capital to study. We participated in the founding ceremony of New China and the first National Day after the victory. We deeply felt the glorious victory of the motherland and the greatness of the people's power. We are proud of how happy the youth in the Mao Zedong era should be! In particular, the great unity of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China is truly an unprecedented historical event! The peaceful construction of the motherland over the past year has encouraged everyone's heart to move forward. The beautiful vision of New China is beckoning to us, making us excitedly cheer and happily sing.

However, the U.S. imperialists do not want peace and do not allow us to build. They frantically launched a war, directly invaded Korea, and murdered, raped, and plundered the Korean people. They attempted to enslave the whole world and attempted to use Korea as a springboard for invading China. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, we have been closely watching the development of the international situation and caring about the peace-loving Korean people. We feel that the pain of the Korean people is like our own pain, which deepens our hatred for U.S. imperialism. We have automatically participated in current affairs studies and actively carried out propaganda work, concentrating all our strength on the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country.

Comrades! Although we are border youth, we love the motherland and hate U.S. imperialism as much as other brotherly ethnic youth. Because we have suffered from imperialist national oppression, we deeply know the loveliness and preciousness of democracy, independence, freedom, and peace. We must turn anger into strength and unite to overthrow the invaders. Therefore, when we heard that you bravely went to Korea to help the Korean brothers, we were moved to tears. All the Chinese people and even the peace-loving people of the world will admire your righteous actions very much. Now the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland are closely united around Chairman Mao. Therefore, our strength is unparalleled.

Comrades, go forward! The people of all ethnic groups in the motherland are supporting you. We will learn from your spirit, fight for justice, fight for lasting world peace, and final victory will surely belong to the peace-loving Chinese and Korean people. Glory belongs to you!

To the Korean People's Army

In their letter to the Korean People's Army, they said: Comrades! You are the liberators of the Korean people, you are the defenders of world peace, and you stand at the forefront of the democratic revolution and fight hard against imperialism. Although U.S. imperialism uses large-scale land, sea, and air forces to frantically attack the peace-loving Korean people, your heroic and resolute spirit has given the aggressors a severe blow. Your righteous actions have won the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world. No matter how frantically the enemy struggles, behind you, there are vast hundreds of millions of peace-loving people supporting you. We firmly believe that the imperialist aggressors will be defeated by the great power of the people, and the final victory will surely belong to the glorious Korean people.

We love the motherland and love peace. We deeply realize the preciousness of democracy, independence, freedom, and peace. Like the youth of other brotherly ethnic groups in China, we wholeheartedly support your just war.

The letter concludes by saying: Dear comrades, go forward! The people of China and Korea have been closely united. The Chinese people have roared and launched a movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, in order to defend the motherland and for world peace. Young people in our country have enthusiastically signed up to join the Volunteer Army to go to your country to fight side by side with you, comrades, to eliminate our common enemy. Comrades, charge forward! Drive U.S. imperialism out of Korea and out of Asia, avenge the dead compatriots! Liberate the enslaved Korean people!

    祖国各族人民在支持你们
    北大新疆籍学生向我志愿军致敬
    北京大学新疆籍少数民族学生：安素英（锡伯族）、安浩学（回族）、穆生贵（回族）、马鸣骏（回族）、博大公（满族）、马步青（回族）、刘瑞霖（回族）、王力钧（归化族）、木沙（维吾尔族）、哈力沙（乌孜别克族）等十人联名写信给赴朝抗美的我国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，表示深切的慰问和支援，并对他们英勇奋战的精神，致以崇高的敬意。他们在致中国人民志愿部队的信中说：我们是生长在祖国边疆——新疆的少数民族青年，在反动派统治时，受尽了歧视和压迫；解放后，我们荣幸地来到了人民首都的北京大学学习。我们参加过新中国的成立大典和胜利后的第一个国庆节。我们深深地感到祖国的光辉胜利和人民力量的伟大。我们感到骄傲，生长在毛泽东时代的青年该是多么幸福啊！特别是中华人民共和国各民族的大团结，真是空前未有的史迹！一年来祖国的和平建设，鼓励了每个人前进的心。新中国美满的远景在向我们招手，使我们兴奋地欢呼和愉快地歌唱。
    可是美国帝国主义者却不要和平，不让我们建设。他们疯狂地发动了战争，直接侵略朝鲜，屠杀、奸淫、掠夺朝鲜人民，它们企图奴役全世界，企图把朝鲜作为侵略中国的跳板。从朝鲜战争爆发以后，我们就密切地注意着国际形势的发展、关切着爱好和平的朝鲜人民。我们感到朝鲜人民的痛苦就像我们自己的痛苦一样，更加深了我们对美帝的仇恨。我们自动地参加了时事学习，积极地进行宣传工作，把所有的力量都集中到抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动里。
    同志们！我们虽然是边疆青年，但是我们和其他兄弟民族青年同样的热爱祖国，仇恨美帝。因为我们曾经受过帝国主义的民族压迫，我们深深地知道民主、独立、自由、和平的可爱和可贵。我们要把愤怒化为力量，一致打倒侵略者，所以我们听到你们英勇赴朝援助朝鲜兄弟时，我们感动得流泪。全中国人民甚至全世界爱好和平的人民对你们的正义行动都将是万分敬佩的。现在祖国各族人民都紧密地团结在毛主席的周围了。因此，我们的力量是坚强无比的。
    同志们，前进吧！祖国各民族人民在支持你们。我们将学习你们的精神，为正义而战，为世界永久和平而战，最后胜利一定属于爱好和平的中朝人民，光荣是属于你们的！
    致朝鲜人民军信
    他们在致朝鲜人民军的信中说：同志们！你们是朝鲜人民的解放者，你们是世界和平的捍卫者，你们站在民主革命的最前线和帝国主义作艰苦的斗争。美国帝国主义虽然用大规模的陆海空军，向爱好和平的朝鲜人民疯狂进攻，但是你们英勇的坚决不屈的精神，给了侵略者以严重的回击。你们正义的行动，得到了全世界爱好和平人士的同情和支持。不管敌人是如何的疯狂挣扎，而在你们的后面，有广大的数万万爱好和平的人民在支持你们。我们深信帝国主义侵略者会为人民的伟大力量所击败，最后的胜利一定属于光荣的朝鲜人民。
    我们热爱祖国，热爱和平，我们深深地体会到民主、独立、自由、和平的可贵，我们和中国其他兄弟民族的青年一样，全心全力地支持你们正义的战争。
    信中最后说：亲爱的同志们，前进吧！我们中朝两国人民已经紧密的团结起来了。中国人民已经怒吼起来了，为了保卫祖国，为了世界和平掀起了抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动。我国青年纷纷踊跃报名参加了志愿军，到贵国去和同志们并肩作战，消灭我们共同的敌人。同志们，向前冲啊！把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜去，赶出亚洲去，为死难的同胞复仇！解放被奴役的朝鲜人民！
