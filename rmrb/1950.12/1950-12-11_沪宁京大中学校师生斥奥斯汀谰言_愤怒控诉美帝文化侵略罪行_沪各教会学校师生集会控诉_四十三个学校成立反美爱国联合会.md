    [Reported by this newspaper] Teachers and students of various church schools in Shanghai angrily protested against the insulting remarks made by the U.S. representative to the Security Council, Austin, against the Chinese people. They held anti-American patriotic rallies, accused American imperialism of the harm of cultural aggression, and supported the accusations made by students of Nanjing Ginling Women's College and the University of Nanking against the American professor Fairise. On the 7th, an anti-American patriotic united association was formed with the participation of students from forty-three schools, in order to strengthen unity and more forcefully counter the conspiracies of American imperialism.
    At the anti-American patriotic rally held at St. John's University on the 5th, Professor Pan Shizi revealed that the school's past education system was not suitable for China's needs, that the real power of school administration was in the hands of Americans, and that Chinese professors suffered discrimination in terms of treatment. Professor Ni Baochun, who had worked at the school for twenty-two years, also used his own experience to angrily point out that Austin called cultural aggression a "favor." Chen Shanxiu and Yang Zuofeng, veteran workers who had worked at the school for thirty-one years, both exposed the discrimination of American professors against Chinese workers. Students at the school were filled with righteous indignation and spoke out one after another, expressing their serious attitude. Dai Keguang, a student in the Department of Journalism, said: "I studied at St. John's Middle School and St. John's University, but I am not deceived by Austin. I want to tell Austin: I resolutely respond to the government's call and sign up to join the National Defense Forces!" The meeting resolved to send a telegram to church schools across the country, calling on them to jointly expose the conspiracy of American imperialist cultural aggression.
    The anti-American patriotic rally held at the University of Shanghai on the 6th was attended by more than 2,000 student and professor representatives from church schools including the University of Shanghai, Soochow University Law School, St. John's University, Qingxin Girls' High School, Yates Memorial Girls' High School, Shanghai East Middle School, Jinde Girls' High School (all of the above are run by Christian churches), as well as St. Francis High School, St. Francis Primary School, Qiming Girls' High School, and Xuhui Middle School (all of the above are run by Catholic churches). Professor Huang Wenji of the University of Shanghai exposed the reactionary and absurd remarks of some American professors at the meeting. He pointed out that American professor Beath had deceived students by saying: "The United States is an industrial country, and China should remain an agricultural country. China and the United States should divide the work." His purpose was to make China a colony of the United States. Another American professor, Hipps, had said to students: "Why don't you fight the Communist Party?" Some American professors even frantically said: "China has too many people, and war should be used to reduce them!" These absurd remarks fully exposed the ambitions of American imperialism to invade China and launch wars. Students from the University of Shanghai and representatives from various schools spoke one after another, pointing out the true face of the enslavement education promoted by American imperialism in China, and expressed their determination to resolutely engage in the struggle against American imperialism.
    In addition, Aurora University, Soochow University Shanghai School, Soochow University Law School, McTyeire School, Qingxin Girls' High School, YMCA Middle School, St. Francis Xavier's College, Xuhui Middle School, and other eight schools held separate rallies, accusing American imperialism of cultural aggression and protesting against the absurd remarks made by American representative Austin in the Security Council insulting the Chinese people.
    More than a thousand teachers, students, and staff of Shanghai St. John's University and representatives of forty-two church schools in Shanghai held an anti-American patriotic rally on the 8th. The anti-American patriotic appeal delegation from Nanjing Ginling Women's College and the University of Nanking also attended the meeting to accuse the American professor Fairise and others of insulting and slandering the Chinese people, which was warmly supported by the audience. The meeting invited two professors, Nie Guangchi (now a professor at Jiaotong University) and Gu Jincheng (now a professor at Guanghua University), who were forced to leave St. John's University after the "May 30th" massacre twenty-five years ago for participating in the patriotic movement, to report on the situation of the imperialists suppressing the patriotic movement of Chinese students at that time. Professor Nie Guangchi was insulted by the American president of the school, Bu Fangji, and left the school in anger, vowing never to return to St. John's University. After twenty-five years, yesterday he stepped into St. John's University again to participate in the anti-American patriotic rally. When he described the situation of that year on the stage, he was so moved and excited that he shed tears, telling everyone to distinguish between enemies and friends. After being forced to leave the school, Professor Gu Jincheng and more than 500 teachers and students who left the school at that time founded Guanghua University. He condemned Austin's shameless slander and called on everyone to jointly promote the spirit of patriotism and resolutely resist the United States and aid Korea. Zhong Yuzheng, a student at Ginling Women's College, accused the imperialist element Fairise of various facts of insulting and slandering the people and leaders of our country, and revealed that Austin's so-called "favor" was actually instilling pro-American, fear-American, and worship-American ideas. She called on everyone to unite and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Students throughout the venue enthusiastically shouted slogans, expressing sympathy and support. Xu Shengqing, a student at Soochow Law School, represented the Anti-American Patriotic United Association of Church School Students in Shanghai, expressing firm support for Ginling Women's College and the University of Nanking in their patriotic and just struggle against insult and slander. The Anti-American Patriotic Appeal Delegation from Nanjing Ginling Women's College and the University of Nanking brought a banner presented by the Student Union of Nanjing University to all the students of St. John's, which read: "Chinese students unite to oppose American imperialism, oppose insults, and oppose slander."
    The day before, students from forty-three church schools, including Shanghai St. John's, Shanghai University, Soochow University, and Hangzhou University, established the Anti-American Patriotic United Association to unite all church school students and more forcefully counter the conspiracies of American imperialism.

    愤怒控诉美帝文化侵略罪行
    沪各教会学校师生集会控诉
    四十三个学校成立反美爱国联合会
    【本报讯】上海各教会学校师生愤怒抗议美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀侮辱中国人民的发言，纷纷举行反美爱国大会，控诉美帝文化侵略的毒害，支援南京金陵女子文理学院和金陵大学学生对美籍教授费睿思的控诉。并于七日组成四十三个学校学生参加的反美爱国联合会，以加强团结，更有力地回击美帝国主义的阴谋。
    圣约翰大学于五日召开的反美爱国大会上，潘世兹教授揭发了该校过去教育制度不适合中国需要、学校行政实权操在美国人手里以及中国教授在待遇上遭受歧视等情形。在该校工作二十二年的倪葆春教授也以自己亲身的体验，愤怒地指出奥斯汀把文化侵略说为“恩惠”。在该校工作三十一年的老工友陈善修以及杨作丰，都揭穿美籍教授对中国工友的歧视。该校学生都义愤填膺，纷纷发言，表示严正态度。新闻系学生戴可光说：“我从圣约翰中学读到圣约翰大学，但我并不受奥斯汀的欺骗。我要告诉奥斯汀：我坚决响应政府号召，报名参加国防军！”大会决议通电全国各教会学校，号召共同揭发美帝国主义文化侵略的阴谋。
    六日在沪江大学举行的反美爱国大会，参加的教会学校有沪江大学、东吴大学法学院、圣约翰大学、清心女中、晏摩氏女中、沪东中学、进德女中等（以上为基督教教会所办），以及斯高中学、斯高小学、启明女中、徐汇中学（以上为天主教教会所办）等校学生和教授代表共二千余人。沪江大学教授黄文几在大会上揭发该校若干美籍教授的反动荒谬言论。他指出：美籍教授毕义斯（Beath）曾欺骗学生说：“美国是工业国，中国应保持农业国，中美两国分工。”其目的是要使中国成为美国的殖民地。另一美籍教授海波斯（Hipps）曾向学生说：“你们为什么不打共产党？”有的美籍教授竟疯狂地说：“中国人口太多，应该用战争来减少些！”这些荒谬言论都充分暴露了美帝国主义侵略中国和发动战争的野心。沪江大学学生和各校代表都相继发言，指出美帝国主义在中国推行的奴化教育的真面目，并表示要坚决从事反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    此外，震旦大学、之江大学沪校、东吴大学法学院、中西女中、清心女中、青年会中学、圣芳济中学、徐汇中学等八校都分别举行了大会，控诉美帝国主义文化侵略和抗议美国代表奥斯汀在安理会侮辱中国人民的谬论。
    上海圣约翰大学全体师生员工及上海四十二个教会学校代表千余人，又于八日举行反美爱国大会。南京金陵女子文理学院及金陵大学反美爱国呼吁代表团也到会控诉美籍教授费睿思等对中国人民的侮辱诽谤行为，获得全场热烈支持。会上邀请了二十五年前“五卅”惨案后，因参加爱国运动被迫离开圣约翰大学的校友聂光墀（现任交通大学教授）、顾荩丞（现任光华大学教授）两教授报告当时帝国主义镇压中国学生爱国运动的情形。聂光墀教授当时因受到该校美籍校长卜舫济侮辱后，愤而离校，并发誓永不再回圣约翰大学。事隔二十五年，在昨天他重又踏进圣约翰大学参加反美爱国大会。当他在台上声述当年情形时，感慨兴奋得流下了热泪，告诉大家要分清敌友。顾荩丞教授在被迫离校后曾和当时五百多名离校师生创办了光华大学。他痛斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言，并号召大家共同发扬爱国主义精神，坚决抗美援朝。金陵女子文理学院学生钟玉征向大会控诉了帝国主义分子费睿思侮辱、诽谤我国人民和领袖的各种事实，揭露奥斯汀所谓“恩惠”，实际是在灌输亲美、恐美、崇美思想。她呼吁大家团结起来积极的参加抗美援朝运动。全场学生热烈高呼口号，表示同情声援。东吴法学院学生徐圣庆代表上海市教会学校学生反美爱国联合会，表示坚决支持金陵女子文理学院及金陵大学反侮辱反诽谤的爱国正义斗争。南京金陵女子文理学院、金陵大学反美爱国呼吁代表团带来了南京大学学生会献给约圣翰全体学生的锦旗，旗上写着：“中国学生团结起来，反美帝，反侮辱，反诽谤。”
    在此前一日，上海圣约翰、沪江、东吴、之江等四十三个教会学校学生成立了反美爱国联合会，以团结所有教会学校学生，更有力地回击美帝国主义的阴谋。
