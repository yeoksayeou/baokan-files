Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 18th: The entire monastic community of Bai Li Temple in Ganzi County, Xikang Province, upon hearing the devastating news that Geda Hutuktu of their temple, while working for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, was tragically murdered by imperialist special agents in Changdu on August 22nd, sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, reporting the matter. The telegram stated:

When the Red Army went north to resist Japan, Geda Hutuktu of Bai Li Temple in Ganzi, Xikang, participated in the establishment of the Bopa (Tibetan People) government under the leadership of the Communist Party. This time, for the sake of the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the cause of religious reform, he traveled to Lhasa despite all difficulties. Not long after arriving in Changdu, he suddenly passed away. Upon hearing this, the monks and believers of Bai Li Temple felt as if they had lost their head and eyes. While preparing for memorial services and prayers, they also thoroughly investigated the circumstances of his passing, and will report further after obtaining the true situation. After the Living Buddha went to Tibet, Jiaben was temporarily entrusted to take care of household matters and miscellaneous affairs, and he retained the seal. We monks and believers are determined to continue to strive to fulfill the Living Buddha's legacy.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 3rd (Delayed): After Geda, a member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, was murdered by British special agent Ford and reactionary elements within the Lhasa authorities, a solemn memorial service was held in Chongqing on November 25th. Those attending included Southwest Military and Political Committee Vice Chairmen Deng Xiaoping, Liu Wenhui, Wang Weizhou, Director of the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Zhang Jichun, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region Li Da, heads of various Southwest Region and Chongqing Municipal organs, representatives of various people's organizations, and all members of the Southwest Nationalities Delegation and Art Troupe who had just returned from the capital after celebrating National Day, totaling more than 800 people. During the service, Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping personally presented a wreath. In his speech, Vice Chairman Wang Weizhou recounted Geda's contributions to the Red Army during the Long March and to the cause of the liberation of Kangzang, saying: "The assassination of Comrade Geda this time is inseparable from the British imperialists' repeated obstruction of the Tibetan local representatives from going to Beijing to conduct peaceful negotiations with the Central People's Government. Our fraternal nationalities must be more vigilant, unite closely, and smash all the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists." Deputy Commander Li Da said in his speech: "Comrade Geda has always been a close friend of the People's Liberation Army, and we will commemorate him with the complete liberation of Tibet." Tibetan representative Bangda Duoji, a colleague of Comrade Geda in the Bopa government, Awang Jiacuo (Tibetan), a friend of Comrade Geda during his lifetime, Hui representative Zong Qixin, and Dai representative Zhao Cunxin, in their speeches, expressed great anger at the poisoning of Comrade Geda by British imperialist elements. They unanimously expressed their determination to unite closely around the Central People's Government, smash the imperialists' divisive conspiracies against Tibet, and commemorate Comrade Geda.

    白利寺僧众惊悉格达被害噩耗
    特电报告毛主席朱总司令
    重庆各界沉痛举行追悼大会
    【新华社重庆十八日电】西康省甘孜县白利寺全体僧众，闻悉该寺活佛格达为奔走西藏和平解放不幸于八月二十二日在昌都惨遭帝国主义特务分子杀害的噩耗后，特电毛主席朱总司令报告。电文中说：
    西康甘孜白利寺格达呼图克图在红军北上抗日时，曾在共产党领导下，参加组成博巴（藏族人民）政府，此次又为谋西藏和平解放及宗教改进事业，不辞万难前赴拉萨，行至昌都不久，突然圆寂。白利寺僧侣信众闻悉之下，如丧头首，如失眼目。一面准备祭奠超度，一面确查圆寂内情，一俟获得真实情况后，再作报告。活佛去藏后，有关家务杂事方面，曾推甲本暂为照管，留有印鉴，我等僧侣信众，决继续为完成活佛之遗志而奋斗。
    【新华社重庆三日电】迟到：西南军政委员会委员格达被英国特务分子福特和拉萨当局中的反动分子谋害后，重庆市各界已于十一月二十五日举行沉痛的追悼大会。到西南军政委员会副主席邓小平、刘文辉、王维舟、中共中央西南局组织部部长张际春、西南军区副司令员李达、西南区及重庆市各机关首长、各人民团体代表，和刚从首都归来的西南各民族庆祝国庆代表团及文工团全体人员共八百余人。会中，邓小平副主席亲献花圈。王维舟副主席在讲话中历述了格达委员在红军长征时期对红军的帮助和对康藏解放事业的贡献后说：“格达委员这次被暗害，是与英帝国主义者一再阻挠西藏地方代表到北京和中央人民政府进行和平谈判分不开的。我们兄弟民族要更加提高警惕，紧密团结，粉碎帝国主义者的一切侵略阴谋。”李达副司令员致词说：“格达委员自始至终都是人民解放军亲密的朋友，我们一定以全部解放西藏的行动来纪念他。”曾经和格达委员在博巴政府中一起工作过的藏族代表邦达多吉、格达委员生前好友阿旺嘉错（藏族），回族代表宗奇新，?族代表召存信等的讲话中，都对英帝国主义分子毒害格达委员，表示极大的愤怒。他们并一致表示要紧紧地团结在中央人民政府的周围，粉碎帝国主义者对西藏的分裂阴谋，来纪念格达委员。
