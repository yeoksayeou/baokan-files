Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 13th: Truth Daily reporters Lasadin and Felipov report from Washington on the results of the Truman-Attlee talks, stating: The talks between Truman and Attlee have ended. Newspapers continue to speculate about what is hidden beneath the diplomatic language of the communique, and what the true results of the Washington talks are. First and foremost, it is evident that Attlee and Truman tried everything possible to boast about what "unity" and "common goals" they believe bind the US-British bloc together. They are unwilling to let the scandals within the crumbling Atlantic Pact alliance spread, in order to conceal from public opinion the disagreements between them, which grow with each new military and diplomatic failure of the United States. This was the main purpose of Attlee's recent speech at the National Press Club in Washington, in which he tediously harped on the "loyalty" and "permanent friendship" between Britain and the United States. But Attlee and Truman are whitewashing. Many dispatches from Europe by American journalists confirm that the Korean War has fueled discord between Britain and the United States. The reporters continued, saying that everyone knows how much the Chinese people, who have already broken free from the hated shackles of the American puppet Chiang Kai-shek, hate Wall Street. Everyone also knows the British government's two-faced policy towards the People's Republic of China. The Truman-Attlee communique once again shows that the American ruling clique intends to continue its policy of aggression in Asia as before. The evidence is: they refuse to withdraw American troops from Korea and Taiwan Island, and oppose the People's Republic of China's participation in the United Nations organization.

Lasadin and Felipov emphasized that the American newspapers made a particular fuss about the section of the Truman-Attlee communique that discussed their European policy. So-called "European defense" is portrayed as a major link in American military strategy. Under the pretext of the "Korean crisis" and hysterical cries about "threats," the American ruling clique intends to bind its partners in the North Atlantic Alliance even tighter, in order to prepare for new imperialist adventures. Just like pixels, American and British imperialists are making painstaking efforts to conceal the aggressive nature of their war preparations with words like "defense."

On the one hand, announcing the intensification of the arms race and a significant increase in the number of troops, on the other hand, the American ruling clique irrationally attempts to portray this frenzied war preparation as a means of preventing war. In addition to the already greatly inflated American military budget (according to American newspaper reports, the American military budget will reach an unprecedented figure of 75 billion US dollars this year), the American government also intends to extract billions of dollars from the pockets of American taxpayers. At the same time, the reactionary American newspapers wrote with undisguised distress that the military expenses of the Western European Atlantic group countries were obviously not satisfying the American ruling clique. The Truth Daily reporters emphasized: In light of these circumstances, it is not difficult to understand that when Attlee signed the joint US-British communique, he agreed to Washington's demands, which was to place the new burden of the arms race on the shoulders of the British people. While carrying out a frantic arms race, the American aggressive clique is concentrating its efforts on preparing cannon fodder for their new military adventures. The American military headquarters is rushing to acquire command of the armies of the North Atlantic Alliance countries. It is expected that, according to the Truman-Attlee agreement, American General Eisenhower will be appointed in the near future as the supreme commander of the so-called "unified army" of the North Atlantic Group. These "unified armies" subordinate to American generals will also include the West German army that is currently being established.

The talks between Truman and Attlee show that the ruling cliques of the United States and Britain intend to continue their policies of aggression in Asia and Europe as before. Truman and Attlee are trying to act as peacemakers. However, their words and actions are inconsistent. Truman can reach an agreement with Attlee. Wall Street and the City of London can find a common language. However, it is impossible to eliminate the deep chasm between peace-loving people and war-mongers. The people of all countries are unwilling to be pawns in imperialist gambles any longer. The Truth Daily reporters concluded the article by stating that today, the decisive factor in international life is not the behind-the-scenes negotiations and conspiracies of imperialists, but the will of the people of all countries, their determination to defend peace and security.

    真理报驻华盛顿记者报道
    杜艾会谈结果再次证明美英坚持侵略欧亚政策
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：真理报记者拉萨丁和费利波夫自华盛顿报道杜鲁门与艾德礼会谈的结果称：杜鲁门和艾德礼的会谈已经结束。报纸继续揣测在公报的外交词令下都隐藏着什么东西，华盛顿会谈的真正结果是些什么。首先显而易见的是：艾德礼和杜鲁门试尽一切办法来夸耀什么“团结一致”和“共同目标”，据他们说就是这些东西把美英集团结合起来的。他们不愿意使摇摇欲坠的大西洋公约联盟内部的丑闻外扬，为的是要在公众舆论面前掩盖他们之间的每逢美国有了新的军事与外交失败就要随之增长的意见分歧。这就是艾德礼最近在华盛顿的全国记者俱乐部发表讲演的主要目的，他在这个讲演里烦絮其辞地大谈其英美之间的什么“忠诚”和“永久的友谊”。但是艾德礼和杜鲁门是在粉饰门面。美国记者从欧洲发回的许多通讯证实朝鲜战争已促成英美之间的意见不和。记者继续说，任何人都知道，已经挣脱了美国傀儡蒋介石的可憎枷锁的中国人民，是如何地痛恨华尔街。任何人也都知道英国政府对中华人民共和国进行的两面政策。杜鲁门艾德礼的公报再一次显示了，美国统治集团还打算和以前一样继续进行他们在亚洲的侵略政策。证据是：他们拒绝把美国军队撤出朝鲜和台湾岛，反对中华人民共和国参加联合国组织。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫强调说，美国报纸对于杜鲁门艾德礼公报中论及他们的欧洲政策的一段，特别小题大做。所谓“欧洲防务”被说成是美国军事战略中的主要环节。美国统治集团以“朝鲜危机”和关于“威胁”的歇斯底里的叫喊为借口，打算把北大西洋联盟的伙伴束缚得更紧一些，以便准备新的帝国主义冒险。像素来一样，美英帝国主义者费尽心机力图以“防御”之类的话来掩饰他们战争准备的侵略性质。
    一方面宣布加紧军备竞赛并且大大地增加军队的数目，另一方面美国统治集团又违背情理地企图把这种狂热的战争准备说成是防止战争的手段。在已经大大膨胀的美国军事预算（根据美国报纸消息，美国军事预算今年将达到七百五十亿美元空前未有的数字）以外，美国政府还打算在美国纳税人的钱袋中榨取数十亿美元。同时，美国的反动报纸对他们的苦恼毫不加掩饰地写道，西欧大西洋集团国家的军事费用显然并不令美国统治集团满意。真理报记者强调说：参照这些情况，不难理解：当艾德礼在美英联合公报上签字时，他同意了华盛顿方面的要求，那就是把军备竞赛的新负担放在英国人民肩上。美国侵略集团在开展疯狂的军备竞赛时，集中力量为他们的新军事冒险准备炮灰。美国军事总部急忙要取得北大西洋联盟国家的军队的统率权。预料按照杜鲁门艾德礼的协议，美国艾森豪威尔将军将在最近的将来被任命为北大西洋集团的所谓“统一军队”的最高总司令。这些隶属于美国将军们的“统一军队”还将包括现正建立中的西德军队。
    杜鲁门与艾德礼的会谈表明，美英两国的统治集团打算仍像从前一样地继续他们在亚洲与欧洲的侵略政策。杜鲁门与艾德礼正试图装作和事佬。然而，他们都言行不符。杜鲁门可以与艾德礼达成协议。华尔街与伦敦城可以找到共同的语言。然而，要消除渴望和平的人民与战争煽动者之间的深沉的鸿沟，却是不可能的。各国人民不愿再做帝国主义赌博中的小卒了。真理报记者在该文结语中称，今日在国际生活中构成决定性因素的，不是帝国主义者的幕后谈判与阴谋诡计，而是各国人民的意志、他们保卫和平与安全的决心。
