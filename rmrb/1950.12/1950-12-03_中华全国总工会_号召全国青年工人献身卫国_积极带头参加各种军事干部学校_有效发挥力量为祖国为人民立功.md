Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Letter to Young Workers Nationwide:

Young Worker Comrades across the country:

The Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council's call for young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools is precisely the best opportunity for us young workers to dedicate ourselves to serving the country. Our beloved motherland has a long history of five thousand years of culture, a hardworking and brave population of 475 million, and vast territory and abundant resources. We have the great people's leader – Chairman Mao Zedong. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism on the Chinese mainland, and established the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which is sincerely supported by the people of the whole country. China's international status has been unprecedentedly elevated. The oppression and humiliation suffered by the Chinese people from imperialism for more than a century since the Opium War has been swept away. The Chinese people have stood tall on the world political stage. All these victories would not have been possible without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the people's democratic united front, and without our long and arduous armed struggle. The powerful armed forces – the Chinese People's Liberation Army – have played a decisive role in our victory today. In the past, under the rule of those reactionary, fatuous, cowardly, feudal comprador, and bureaucrat-bourgeois elements in China, the people could not establish a strong armed force, and we suffered imperialist bullying for a long time. Today, we must build a strong air force and navy so that American imperialism can no longer invade our Taiwan by force, and can no longer violate our sacred airspace and territorial waters. The decision of my Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council fully meets the needs of the people's motherland, and also fully meets the ardent demands of our revolutionary young students and young workers to devote themselves to the great national defense construction cause. Recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military schools of the People's Liberation Army, so that we can learn and master various modern military scientific knowledge and military technology, and become excellent military cadres, is of extremely important significance for building a modern national defense army.

Young worker comrades! In order to defend our motherland's national defense, to consolidate the revolutionary victories we have achieved, to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and to prevent the dirty snouts of imperialism from reaching into our motherland's lovely garden, young worker comrades with revolutionary traditions! We must respond to the call of the motherland and participate in various military cadre schools to learn military science and military technology. On this issue, just as in the production competition, we must stand at the forefront and play a leading and exemplary role. This is the most glorious and promising position, and this is also the best time for our enthusiastic young workers to effectively exert their strength and prepare to make contributions and establish careers for the motherland and the people. Patriotic young worker comrades! Warmly and bravely respond to the call of the government to accelerate and strengthen our national defense construction forces! The motherland is calling us!

    号召全国青年工人献身卫国
    积极带头参加各种军事干部学校  有效发挥力量为祖国为人民立功
    【新华社二日讯】中华全国总工会告全国青年工人书：全国青年工人同志们：
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院号召青年学生和青年工人参加各种军事干部学校，这正是我们青年工人献身报国的最好时机。我们亲爱的祖国有着五千年的悠久文化，有着四万七千五百万勤劳而勇敢的人民，有着广大的国土与丰富的资源，我们有着伟大的人民领袖——毛泽东主席，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们推翻了帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国大陆上的反动统治，建立了为全国人民所衷心拥护的中华人民共和国中央人民政府，中国的国际地位得到空前的提高，鸦片战争以后百余年来，中国人民所受的帝国主义的压迫与侮辱，从此一扫而光。中国人民已屹然站立在世界政治舞台之上。这一切胜利，如果离开了共产党的领导，离开了人民民主统一战线，离开了我们长期的艰苦的武装斗争，就不可能实现。强大的武装力量——中国人民解放军，对于我们今天的胜利，起着决定性的作用。过去，中国在那些反动的昏庸的怯弱的封建买办、官僚资产阶级的统治之下，人民不可能建立起一支强大的武装力量，我们曾长期遭受帝国主义的凌辱。今天，我们必须建立起一支强大的空军、海军才能使美帝国主义再不能以武力侵略我们的台湾，再不能侵犯我们的神圣的领空、领海。我中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会与政务院的决定完全适合于人民祖国的需要，同时也完全符合我们革命的青年学生与青年工人投身于伟大国防建设事业的热烈要求。吸收青年学生与青年工人来参加人民解放军的各种军事学校，使我们学习掌握各种现代化的军事科学知识与军事技术，成为优秀的军事干部，这对于建设现代化的国防军是有极重要的意义的。
    青年工人同志们！为了保卫我们祖国的国防，为巩固我们已得的革命胜利果实，为了解放台湾、西藏，为了使帝国主义肮脏的猪嘴不能伸进我们祖国这个可爱的花园中来，拥有革命传统的青年工人同志们！我们要响应祖国的号召，参加各种军事干部学校学习军事科学与军事技术。在这个问题上，也像在生产竞赛上一样，我们要站在最前面起带头与模范作用。这是最光荣、最有前途的岗位，这也是我们有热血的青年工人最有效地发挥自己力量，准备为祖国为人民建功立业的最好时机。爱国的青年工人同志们！热烈地、勇敢地响应政府的号召，去加速和增强我们的国防建设力量吧！祖国在呼唤我们！
