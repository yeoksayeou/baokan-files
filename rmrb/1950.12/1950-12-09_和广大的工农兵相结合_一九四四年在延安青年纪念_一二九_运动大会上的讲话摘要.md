Combining with the Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    --Excerpts from a Speech at the Yan'an Youth Meeting Commemorating the "December 9th" Movement in 1944

    Editor's Note: This article is an excerpt from a speech given by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in Yan'an in 1944 to commemorate the "December 9th" Patriotic Youth Movement. Comrade Liu Shaoqi emphasized that the path taken by revolutionary youth during the "December 9th" era was the path of combining with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They not only went to the countryside but also to the revolutionary armed forces. Today, China's revolutionary young workers and students are enthusiastically participating in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. They are actively signing up to join revolutionary military cadre schools to strengthen the national defense of our people's motherland. At this time, as we commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement, re-publishing this article by Comrade Liu Shaoqi is of great significance.

    Since the failure of the revolution from 1925 to 1927, a dark and reactionary period appeared in Chinese history. After nine years, apart from the armed revolutionary movements in the countryside, a nationwide upsurge of revolutionary movements began again in the cities, which was the national anti-Japanese salvation movement directly triggered by the December 9th, 1935, student movement in Peiping. These movements were all carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    "December 9th" was the rising tide of the Chinese student revolutionary movement. From this to the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, the Chinese anti-Japanese national salvation movement reached a new high tide and has continued to this day. Although at present, due to the Kuomintang's reactionary policies being re-implemented, the mass movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has declined again, this is only a partial phenomenon. Therefore, from the perspective of the situation of the Chinese revolutionary movement, the "December 9th" Movement is a sign dividing China's reactionary period from its revolutionary period. From then on, China's reactionary forces gradually retreated, and new revolutionary movements began to gradually rise. Although this movement still has some shortcomings, it, along with the people's armed revolutionary movement at the time, is a marker in Chinese history dividing the stage when the revolution began to advance again. What we are doing now is still to realize the basic slogans of the "December 9th" Movement: "Unite Against Foreign Aggression" and "Complete Independence for China." We firmly believe that these slogans and demands will achieve victory.

    The historical experience of the "December 9th" Movement and the path it took are what we should learn from. From the "December 9th" of 1935 to the "July 7th" of 1937, there were nineteen months in between. At that time, it was difficult to keep this newly arising revolutionary movement from being suppressed by the reactionary forces in the cities under reactionary rule. But it was maintained. This was primarily due to the implementation of a cautious and correct policy. Maintaining the revolutionary enthusiasm of the student masses mobilized by the "December 9th" Movement and the revolutionary strength that had been accumulated until the "July 7th" Incident in 1937, because there was a new situation of national resistance against Japan, broad development conditions were obtained. The revolutionary students in the cities were then able to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants and with the armed forces of the workers and peasants - the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Therefore, the majority of the young people who participated in the "December 9th" Movement have now become military commanders, political workers, local administrative leaders, and guides in economic and cultural work on the enemy's rear battlefields. They stand in very important positions in all aspects of the war to defend the motherland today, carrying out very effective struggles for their wishes of "December 9th". It is believed that in the near future, they will return to Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places as victors and masters, proudly shouting the slogan "Long live the independence of the Chinese nation," which they had shouted during "December 9th." From this, it can be seen that a purely student revolutionary movement cannot achieve victory, nor can it persist for a long time under reactionary rule. Revolutionary young students must combine with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they must be under the leadership of the Communist Party to achieve the goal of the revolution.

    The path taken by the revolutionary students in the "December 9th" Movement is a model. The revolutionary young students of the "December 9th" era (especially the students of Peiping) have already pointed out a path—to go to the countryside, to go to the revolutionary armed forces, to unite with the people, especially with the peasants, to establish revolutionary base areas and carry out the War of Resistance Against Japan under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the correct path for all revolutionary young students to strive for national liberation in the face of national crisis.

### 和广大的工农兵相结合  ——一九四四年在延安青年纪念“一二九”运动大会上的讲话摘要

    和广大的工农兵相结合
    ——一九四四年在延安青年
    纪念“一二九”运动大会上的讲话摘要
    编者按：这篇文章是刘少奇同志于一九四四年在延安纪念“一二九”青年爱国运动的讲话摘要。刘少奇同志着重指出“一二九”时代革命青年所走的道路，就是和广大的工农兵相结合的道路。他们不但到乡村去，而且到革命的武装部队中去。今天中国革命的青年工人和青年学生正热烈参加抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，正踊跃报名参加革命军事干部学校，加强人民祖国的国防力量。在这个时候，我们纪念“一二九”运动的十五周年，重新发表刘少奇同志这篇文章是有重要意义的。
    自从一九二五年至二七年的革命失败后，中国历史上就出现了一个黑暗反动的时期，这个时期经过九年之后，除开在乡村中的武装革命运动外，在城市中又开始了带有全国性的革命运动的高涨，那就是一九三五年十二月九日北平学生运动所直接引起的全国抗日救国运动。这些运动都是在中国共产党领导之下进行的。
    “一二九”是中国学生革命运动的来潮，由此到一九三七年“七七事变”，中国抗日救国运动才达到新的高潮，并一直继续到现在。虽然在目前由于国民党反动政策的重新施行，国民党统治区内的群众运动曾再度消沉，但这仅是部分的现象。所以，从中国革命运动的形势来讲，“一二九”运动是划分中国反动时期与革命时期的一个标志。从此，中国反动势力逐渐后退，而新的革命运动则开始逐渐高涨。尽管这个运动还存在一些缺点，但它和当时人民武装革命运动一道，在中国历史上是一个划分革命开始重新前进阶段的标志。我们现在所做的仍是实现“一二九”运动的基本口号：“一致对外”、“中国完全独立”。我们坚信这些口号与要求，将要达到胜利。
    “一二九”运动的历史经验和它所走的道路是我们应该学习的。由一九三五年的“一二九”到一九三七年的“七七”，这中间有十九个月，在当时反动统治的城市中保持这个新起的革命运动不被反动势力镇压下去，是有一些困难的。但它是保持下去了。这首先便是由于执行了一种谨慎的正确政策的结果。保持“一二九”运动所发动起来的学生群众的革命热情和聚积起来的革命力量，一直到一九三七年的“七七”，因为有新的全国抗战的局面，才取得了广泛开展的条件。城市中的革命学生才能和广大工农群众相结合，和工农的武装——八路军、新四军相结合。因此，就使参加“一二九”运动的多数青年，现在大部分已成为敌后战场上的军事指挥员、政治工作人员、地方行政负责人以及经济工作、文化工作的指导者了。他们在今天保卫祖国的战争中，站在各方面很重要的岗位上，为他们在“一二九”的愿望而进行着很有效的斗争。相信他们在不久的将来会以胜利者和主人的资格，回到北平、天津、上海等地，骄傲地叫着“中华民族独立万岁”的口号，这是他们在“一二九”时曾经叫着的口号。由此可见，单纯的学生革命运动，是不能获得胜利的，而且也不可能在反动统治之下长期坚持。革命的青年学生必须与广大的工农兵相结合，必须在共产党的领导之下，才能达到革命的目的。
    “一二九”运动中的革命学生所走过的这种道路，是一个模范，“一二九”时代的革命青年学生（特别是北平学生），已经指出了一条道路——到乡村去，到革命的武装部队中去，和人民特别是和农民结合起来，在共产党领导之下，建立革命根据地和进行抗日战争。这是一切革命青年学生在民族危机中争取民族解放的正确道路。  （原载“中国青年”第五十三、五十四期合刊）
