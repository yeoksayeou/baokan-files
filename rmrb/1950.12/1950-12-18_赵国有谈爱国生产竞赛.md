    Zhao Guoyou Talks About Patriotic Production Competition
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    In the office on the third floor of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhao Guoyou sat quietly on the sofa, reviewing documents. Just four hours earlier, he had returned from Tianjin. He went to Tianjin to introduce the advanced experience of the national model workshop—the Zhao Guoyou Workshop—in launching a patriotic production competition to trade union cadres, model workers, and worker representatives in Tianjin. Today—December 7th—after returning to Beijing, he immediately took up the position of Deputy Director of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He is preparing to go to Shanghai tomorrow—December 8th—to work. There are three tasks in Shanghai: (1) Introduce production experience and help Shanghai workers engage in production competitions; (2) Mobilize young Shanghai workers to join military cadre schools; (3) Learn from the Shanghai worker brothers who have rich experience in struggle. This is his first task as Deputy Director of the Production Department.
    Zhao Guoyou knows that his honor is inseparable from the efforts of the workers of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory. He has written several letters to the workers of the No. 3 Machine Factory, one of which reads: "After leaving you, I miss you all the time, especially our work. Sometimes I even dream of working in the workshop while sleeping." Thanks to the hard work of Zhao Guoyou and all the workers of the No. 3 Machine Factory, the No. 3 Machine Factory has become a model for workers across the country to learn from, and the Zhao Guoyou Workshop is a banner for workers across the country to implement the patriotic production competition.
    "Why did the Zhao Guoyou Workshop launch a patriotic production competition movement?" Zhao Guoyou said, "To defend our motherland, defend our hometown, and defend our good life." In just two years since liberation, unprecedented changes have taken place in all aspects of the lives of Shenyang workers. Zhao Guoyou used to be a despised apprentice, never having enough to wear or eat, and watching his children die painfully from illness because he couldn't afford medicine. What about today? His home is filled with sorghum and rice, he lives in a building, wears brand-new clothes, goes to Beijing, goes to the Soviet Union, participates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and is welcomed and respected everywhere. In Zhao Guoyou's factory, all the chimneys are smoking, all the walls are freshly painted, the workers have become the masters of the factory, the workers' wisdom has the opportunity to develop infinitely, innovation record movements and Red May competitions have been launched, production efficiency has been repeatedly improved, and workers' lives have been gradually improved. They have dance halls, clubs, barber shops, bathhouses, cooperatives, and amateur schools. They love this life of peaceful construction.
    However, the United States expanded its aggression in Korea, threatening our country's security and disrupting the peaceful production life of the No. 3 Machine Factory. The workers were all angry. Zhao Guoyou said: "The American bandits want to drag us back to the dark ages of the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. We have tasted the bitterness of the Japanese invaders for fourteen years and suffered the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek. We must not tolerate the American imperialists coming to spoil things again." The workers visited the exhibition commemorating the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, which showed the tragic scenes of American imperialist planes bombing Korea: a Korean peaceful resident's family was bombed, leaving only an eight-year-old child crying while holding a five-year-old younger brother; a child who lost his mother was still sucking on the breast of his bombed mother; a mother carrying her bombed dead child on her back had not yet realized that she no longer had a child. The workers recalled the disasters that the Japanese invaders had inflicted on the Chinese people in the past. Zhao Guoyou, on behalf of the workers, issued a battle cry: "Our workers must launch a patriotic production movement to strengthen national defense and beat the American aggressors to death." This is why the patriotic production competition movement in the No. 3 Machine Factory developed so rapidly.
    In October, as the American imperialist artillery fire approached the Yalu River, the patriotic production competition in the Zhao Guoyou Workshop burned like a raging fire. At that time, the workers had already completed the annual production task and were worried about not having any work to do. The workers discussed and came up with a method: take the initiative to ask the superiors to give more tasks and sign a contract with the manufacturing section to ensure that there was work to do. Seeing that the workers were so enthusiastic about production, the manufacturing section agreed to this request. With the guarantee of the manufacturing section, the workers boldly made plans, made group plans, and made workshop-wide plans. The plans stipulated specific figures for attendance rate, quality, and output, ensuring that they could only exceed and not fail to complete. On this basis, they issued a challenge letter to the entire factory. They also issued a call for competition to the entire Northeast. They said: "We must always win on the production front, not be afraid of American planes strafing and bombing, and insist on working under any circumstances."
    The competition was surging when the Zhao Guoyou Workshop suddenly received an emergency task, limited to seven days to complete. When the superiors assigned the task, they thought that the Zhao Guoyou Workshop was a model workshop and should be given more tasks; but in the Zhao Guoyou Workshop, two foremen were transferred away and four production team leaders were sent to study, so the strength was obviously insufficient. But if this major task was not completed within the time limit, what kind of model would it be? The certificate of merit personally written by Chairman Mao, "Model on the Production Front," shone in the eyes of the workers, "No matter how heavy the task, no matter what difficulties there are, we must complete it!" After working for a day, the workers calculated the work efficiency, and seven days could only complete 70% of the temporary task, "That won't work! We must first lead the entire Northeast in the competition. If we can't complete the task, how can that be?" Everyone was very anxious, and everyone was thinking of ways. Some said: "To complete such a heavy task, we must work overtime!" But the trade union insisted: "We can't work overtime!" The workers said: "Is it okay if we don't want the overtime pay from the public?" The trade union explained from all aspects: "The patriotic production competition is a part of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and it cannot be regarded as a temporary assault task. Resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the production competition are not matters of a day or two, and working overtime all the time will not solve the problem." The trade union also reminded everyone: "Use your brains more!" While producing, the workers were studying and determined a principle: find ways to quickly improve efficiency from both labor organization and production technology.
    According to this principle, the workers found a reason why the work efficiency could not be improved from their actual work: in the past, the workshop had complete manpower, and each group was only assigned to do what they were assigned to do, so they could achieve the effect of "skill"; now some people in each group have been transferred away, the technical ability has been different, and the new task has not been done in the past, so according to the old organization to do things, it will be worse. They decided to reorganize the labor organization of each group, so that the technically high ones do fine work, and the low ones do rough work. This change improved efficiency somewhat. But the task still could not be completed on time. Everyone said: Use all our strength to solve how to complete the task. All kinds of meetings were centered on this issue. In the technical training class, the workers and technicians repeatedly discussed and studied, "Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang." Technician Liao Shangguang and others, based on the workers' experience and opinions, transformed the tool for making pig iron screw caps—the template knife—and helped the workers how to use it, and asked the workers what difficulties they had in using it. After repeated modifications, the new tool immediately produced a new effect: increasing production efficiency eight times. The emergency task of seven days—a task that could hardly be completed on time—was actually completed victoriously in six days. The Zhao Guoyou Workshop has added another glorious page to its history.
    "The victorious Chinese working class has raised its political consciousness and understands how to defend the motherland in various ways." Zhao Guoyou also gave many examples to illustrate this fact. In the past, wages in the Northeast were calculated by the piece. In the production competition, the administration still paid wages by the piece, but the workers thought in their hearts: "Doing one more piece of work is adding one more strength to strike at the American imperialists." Doing more work for the motherland is the political responsibility of the workers. Why should we still want the piece-rate wages for the excess part? Everyone demanded: "Don't want the piece-rate wages for the excess part." Without the piece-rate wages for the excess part, they actually made much more work than in previous years.
    In the past production competition movements, it was often only the workers who were most enthusiastic. This time, the patriotic production competition in the Zhao Guoyou Workshop completely changed this phenomenon: all the staff, technicians, medical staff, administrative staff, and female staff were involved in the heat of the competition. In addition to ensuring that they did their job well, they also ran to the scene to help with the work. They said: "We can't produce screws, but we can help transport screws and other parts, so that those who can produce can produce more." Some female staff members rubbed their hands into blisters while carrying things, but they didn't care. Some technicians and workers were together, white gloves turned into black gloves, and their whole bodies were greasy. It was simply impossible to tell who was a staff member and who was a worker. Under such circumstances, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was even higher. Zhao Guoyou told me: When an old worker was concentrating on his work, his pants fell to the ground, but he didn't know it, and he kept working. Others told him, but he didn't hear it. Later, it was a apprentice who helped him pull up his pants that he realized.
    The working spirit of the Zhao Guoyou Workshop shows that the awakened workers and people of the whole country have infinite power, and this power cannot be underestimated.

    赵国有谈爱国生产竞赛
    本报记者  陈迹
    在全国总工会三层楼上的办公室里，赵国有沉静地坐在沙发上翻阅着文件。四小时以前，他才从天津回来。他到天津去，是把全国模范车间——赵国有车间展开爱国生产竞赛的先进经验，介绍给天津市工会干部、劳动模范和工人代表。今天——十二月七日他回到北京后，立即就任中华全国总工会生产部副部长之职。他正准备明天——十二月八日去上海工作。去上海的任务有三：（一）介绍生产经验，帮助上海工人搞生产竞赛；（二）动员上海青年工人参加军事干部学校；（三）向有着丰富斗争经验的上海工人弟兄学习。这是他当了生产部副部长的首次任务。
    赵国有知道他的荣誉是和沈阳第三机器厂工友们的努力分不开的。他曾几次写信给第三机器厂的工友，其中有一封信是这样写的：“离开你们以后，时时刻刻想念你们，特别是想我们的工作，有时候睡觉也梦见在车间工作。”由于赵国有和第三机器厂所有工友的辛勤努力，第三机器厂成为全国工人学习的榜样，赵国有车间是全国工人实行爱国生产竞赛的旗帜。
    “赵国有车间为什么要展开爱国生产竞赛运动呢？”赵国有说：“为了保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的家乡，保卫我们的好日子。”仅仅解放了两年的沈阳工人，在各方面都发生了史无前例的变化。赵国有过去是个从来被人瞧不起的小徒弟，穿不暖，吃不饱，眼睁睁地看着自己的孩子吃不起药痛苦地病死。今天呢？家里堆满高粱、装满大米，住着楼房，穿的是崭新衣裳，上北京，去苏联，参加过中国人民政治协商会议，到处都受人欢迎和尊敬。赵国有的工厂呢，所有烟囱都冒了烟，所有墙壁都油漆一新，工人成了工厂的主人，工人的智慧得到无穷发展的机会，展开过创新纪录运动和红五月竞赛，出产效率一再提高，工人生活逐步改善，他们有跳舞厅、有俱乐部、有理发室、洗澡堂、合作社，还有业余学校，他们热爱着这个和平建设的生活。
    但是，美帝扩大侵略朝鲜，威胁着我国安全，破坏了第三机器厂安静生产的生活，工友们都愤怒了。赵国有说：“美国强盗又想把我们拖回到日伪和蒋匪的黑暗时代去，我们尝过日寇十四年的苦头，受过蒋介石的压榨，我们决不能容忍美帝再来糟蹋。”工友们参观了朝鲜解放五周年纪念图片展览会，那里展示着美帝飞机轰炸朝鲜的惨象：一个朝鲜和平居民的家庭被炸，只剩下一个八岁的孩子，抱着一个五岁小弟弟啼哭；一个失去了妈妈的孩子，还吮着被炸死的妈妈的乳头；一个背上背着被炸死了的孩子的母亲，还没有发觉自己已经没有了孩子。工人们回忆起过去日寇给予中国人民的灾难，赵国有代表工友们发出了战斗的声音：“咱们工人要展开爱国主义生产运动，增强国防力量，揍死美国侵略者。”这就是机器第三厂爱国生产竞赛运动为什么飞快发展起来的原因。
    十月里，美帝炮火逼近鸭绿江，赵国有车间的爱国生产竞赛如烈火燃烧起来。那时候，工人们已完成了全年生产任务，正愁着没活干，工友们议论纷纷，想出了一个方法：主动要求上级，多给任务，和制造科订立合同，保证有活可做。制造科见工友们生产热情这样高，就答应了这个要求。有了制造科的保证，工友们大胆订计划，订小组计划，订全车间计划，计划里规定了出勤率，质量和产量的具体数字，保证只能超过，不能完不成。在这个基础上，他们向全厂发出了挑战书。他们还向全东北发出了竞赛的号召。他们表示：“要在生产战线永远打胜仗，不怕美机的扫射和轰炸，在任何情况下都要坚持工作。”
    竞赛热潮汹涌澎湃，赵国有车间忽然接到一项紧急任务，限七天完成。上级分配任务时，想到赵国有车间是个模范车间，应该多给些任务；而赵国有车间呢？两个工长被调走，四个生产组长被送去学习，力量显然不够。但是如果不限期完成这个重大任务，那还叫做什么模范？毛主席亲笔写的“生产战线上的模范”的奖状，闪耀在工友们的眼前，“不管任务怎么重，不管有什么困难，我们一定要完成！”工友们干了一天，计算了一下工作效率，七天只能完成临时任务的百分之七十，“那不行！咱们首先带动全东北搞竞赛，如果咱们完不成任务那还能成？”大家很着急，人人在想办法，有的说：“要完成这样重的任务，必须加班加点！”但工会坚持：“不能加班加点！”工友说：“不要公家加班加点的工钱还不行吗？”工会从各方面加以解释：“爱国生产竞赛是抗美援朝斗争的一部分，不能把它看成是临时的突击任务，抗美援朝和生产竞赛都不是一天两天的事，老要加班加点是解决不了问题的。”工会又提醒大家：“多动脑筋！”工友们一面生产，一面在研究，确定了一个原则：从劳动组织和生产技术两方面找寻办法，来迅速提高效率。
    根据这个原则，工友们从实际工作中发现了一个工作效率不能提高的原因：过去车间的人力齐备，各组规定干什么就只干什么，能够收“熟练”之效；如今各组有些人调走了，技术能力有了差别，而且新的任务在过去又没干过，所以按照老的组织来办事，就要差劲些，他们决定重新改变各组劳动组织，使技术高的做细活，低的做粗活，这样一变，效率提高了一些。但还不能按期完成任务，大家说：用一切力量来解决怎样完成任务，各种会议都以这个问题为中心议题，在技术学习班，工友们和技术人员一再讨论、钻研，“三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮”，技术员廖尚光等根据工人的经验和意见，改造了制生铁螺丝帽的工具——样板刀，帮助工友怎样使用，征询工友在使用时有些什么困难，这样又再三修改，立刻使新的工具产生新的效果：提高生产效率八倍。七天的紧急任务——这个难能按期完成的任务——居然在六天内胜利完成了。赵国有车间又增加了一页光荣历史。
    “胜利了的中国工人阶级提高了政治觉悟，就懂得用种种方式来保卫祖国。”赵国有还举了许多例子，来说明这个事实。过去东北是以件计工资的，在生产竞赛中，行政上仍按件给付工资，但工友们心里想：“多做一件活，就是多增加一份打击美帝的力量。”为祖国多做活，是工人的政治责任，为什么还要超额部分的计件工资呢？大家要求：“不要超额部分的计件工资”，不要超额部分的计件工资，反比往年多做出许多活。
    在过去生产竞赛运动中，往往只有工人搞得最火热，这次赵国有车间的爱国生产竞赛完全改变了这个现象：全车间的职员、技术人员、医务人员、事务人员和女职员都卷入了竞赛的热潮里。他们除了保证把本部门工作干好，还跑到现场来帮助工作，他们说：“我们不会生产螺丝钉，但可以帮助搬运螺丝钉和其他零件，使能生产的人可以更多生产。”有的女职员搬东西，把手磨成泡，还不在意。有的技术人员和工人在一起，白手套变成黑手套，全身油腻，简直分不出谁是职员谁是工人。在这样的情况下，工友们的劳动热情就更高了。赵国有告诉我：有个老工人在专心工作的时候，他的裤子掉落在地下，还不知道，还不停地作活，别人告诉他，他没听见，后来还是一个徒弟替他把裤子拉上去时，他才发觉。
    像赵国有车间这种工作精神，说明觉悟了的全国工人和全国人民具有无穷尽的力量，这种力量是不可轻侮的。
