Amidst the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, faculty, students, and staff at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) are filled with patriotic fervor. Even amidst demanding studies and exams, students closely monitor the developing situation. The liberation of Pyongyang sparked an uncontrollable surge of joy at PUMC: the women's dorm celebrated until 2 a.m.; everyone cheered for victory! A wave of consolation emerged! All faculty, students, and staff donated a large number of consolation gifts. Second-year students issued a call: "Let's use our own hands to make things for our People's Volunteers!" This call immediately received enthusiastic responses from various classes in both the medical and nursing schools. For four or five nights, everyone worked intensely until late. A large quantity of white cloth, cotton, bedding, and sweaters were transformed into cotton vests, cotton gloves, woolen scarves, underwear... Fourth-year medical students even donated a large quantity of spiritual food – books – to the soldiers, and also clipped many newspapers, bringing the passion of the motherland to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to the front!

After Austin's shameless slanders at the United Nations were published in the newspapers, students, staff, professors, and doctors all issued indignant protests. During the "December 9th" and "December 1st" commemorative evening gatherings, the tide of protest reached a peak. Unprecedented patriotic enthusiasm surged in everyone's hearts. Just as the representative of the second-year medical students said in a letter read aloud to General Kim Il-sung on behalf of the entire class: "We are now intensifying our studies, preparing to dedicate ourselves to our motherland and our people whenever the motherland needs us!" At the meeting, Comrade Xu Liqun from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League clearly analyzed the recent military and political defeats of U.S. imperialism, and praised the patriotic actions of the PUMC community in supporting the army and other aspects. He also pointed out that Austin's slanderous and shameless lies cannot be tolerated by the Chinese people, who have stood up. The report was warmly welcomed by all the faculty, students, and staff present, expressing extreme contempt and disdain for imperialism and boundless love for their motherland and people. Following this, a representative from Yenching University reported on the enthusiastic participation of Yenching University students in military cadre schools and their angry protests against Austin's shameless insults to the Chinese people. He excitedly relayed the words of Dean Lin Handa: In the past, Yenching University students were threatened externally by the reactionary government, and internally suppressed by the school with heavy workloads and constant exams, preventing them from fully participating in patriotic movements; but today, after liberation, the school has long stood alongside the students on the patriotic front. At that moment, PUMC President Li Zong'en rushed back from a symposium of church groups, schools, and hospitals in the city protesting Austin, and announced that PUMC would participate in the demonstration to protest Austin's shameless slanders with all its strength. Applause and cheers erupted like a volcanic eruption. One student jumped up excitedly and said, "That's right! Let that bastard Austin see how the PUMC students he 'educated' are 'repaying' him!" The chairman of the labor union, professors, doctors, workers, and students also indignantly refuted Austin's fallacies and condemned the insidious schemes of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression. Professor Zhang Xijun said with great indignation: "The reputation that PUMC has today in the medical field is entirely due to the efforts of the Chinese people themselves. Without American money, PUMC can still be run very well!" The fire of resisting America thus burned in PUMC!

Starting at 10 a.m. on the 12th, classes were suspended throughout the school. Each class enthusiastically studied and criticized Austin's speech and studied the People's Daily editorial. At the joint gathering with Yenching University students that afternoon, each class reported the results of their discussions, unanimously exposing the cunning faces of imperialist cultural aggression. The entire second-year class of the medical school proposed taking down the statue of Rockefeller in the PUMC conference room, which was immediately met with enthusiastic applause. Finally, the Student Union announced at the meeting that it accepted the proposals of the various classes, and sent telegrams to the United Nations supporting the speech of our representative Wu Xiuquan and denouncing Austin's fallacies.

On the morning of the 13th, an unprecedented number of professors, doctors, nurses, staff, workers, and male and female students poured out of the wards, machine rooms, libraries, dormitories, departments, and work units, gathering in the C Building plaza, vying to sign the two telegrams supporting our representative Wu Xiuquan and protesting Austin. Thus, a magnificent contingent of more than 600 people and the city's marching crowds merged into a huge torrent on the streets of the capital, and no force could stop this tide of anger against slander!

Under the banner of high patriotism and opposition to imperialist aggression, we have united closely, openly and resolutely demonstrated the position of our victorious Chinese people to the world, and severely shattered the dreams of U.S. imperialism. But this is only a beginning, as our Dean Zhang Yun said: In the past, we at PUMC felt very painful taking money from American capitalists; from today onwards, all of us at PUMC have expressed our attitude and protested Austin's insult to us. We will take more practical actions in the future to continue to persist in the struggle against America!

### 爱国主义的热潮在协和

    爱国主义的热潮在协和
    协和医学院通讯组
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，协和医学院的师生员工们充满了热爱祖国的情绪。同学们在紧张的学习和考试中，仍然密切地注视着时局的发展。平壤解放了，协和医学院涌起了一片抑制不住的欢腾：女生宿舍一直欢庆到深夜两点；大家欢呼胜利！慰劳的热潮掀起来了！全体师生员工献出了大批的慰劳品；医校二年级同学发出了号召：“让我们用自己的双手作出东西献给我们的人民战士吧！”这个号召立刻博得了医护校各班的热烈响应，整整四、五个夜晚，大家一直紧张地工作到深夜。大批的白布、棉花、被褥和毛衣在男女同学的手中变成了棉背心、棉手套、毛围脖、内裤……。医校四年级同学更献给了战士们大批精神食粮——书籍，同时还剪贴了很多的报纸，把祖国抗美援朝的激情带到朝鲜前方去！
    奥斯汀在联合国的无耻谰言在报纸上公布后，同学、职工、教授和大夫们都纷纷发表了愤慨的抗议。在“一二·九”“一二·一”纪念晚会上，抗议的怒潮达到了高峰。空前高涨的爱国热情，激荡在每个人的心里。正像医校二年级同学的代表所朗诵的全班致金日成将军的信上所说：“我们这一群现在正在加紧学习，准备一旦祖国需要我们的时候，随时把我们自己贡献给我们的祖国和人民！”会上由团中央许立群同志对美帝最近在军事上政治上的惨败作了清楚的分析，并赞扬协和的人们在劳军和其他方面的爱国举动，同时，还指出奥斯汀诬蔑性的无耻谰言是不能够为站起来了的中国人民所容忍的。报告引起了全体与会师生员工的热烈欢迎，表现了对帝国主义的极端鄙视蔑视以及对自己祖国和人民的无限热爱。跟着，燕大同学代表燕大保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会报告了燕大同学参加军事干校和愤怒抗议奥斯汀无耻侮辱中国人民的热烈情况。他兴奋地转述了林汉达教务长的话：燕京同学在过去，外面受着反动政府的威胁，内部又被校方用繁重的功课和不断的考试压制着，使他们没有充分参加爱国运动的自由；但解放了的今天，校方早已和同学们一同站在爱国主义的阵线上了。正在这时，协和医学院李宗恩院长从本市各教会团体学校医院抗议奥斯汀座谈会上匆匆赶回，宣布了协和将以全力参加抗议奥斯汀无耻诬蔑的示威大游行。掌声和欢呼像火山迸发似地轰了出来，一个同学激动得跳起来说：“对！这下子也叫奥斯汀这个混蛋看看他所‘教育’的协和学生是怎样地‘报答’他！”工会主席、教授、大夫、工友和同学们也纷纷愤慨地驳斥了奥斯汀的谬论，控诉了美帝文化侵略的毒辣阴谋。张锡钧教授愤慨万分地说：“协和今天在医学界中的一些声誉，完全是由于中国人自己努力的结果。没有美国的钱，协和照样会办得很好！”抗美的怒火就这样地在协和燃烧起来了！
    十二日上午十时起，全校开始停课。各班都热烈地研究批判了奥斯汀的发言，学习了人民日报的社论。当日下午和燕大同学的联欢会上，各班同学都报告了他们讨论的结果，一致揭露了帝国主义文化侵略的狡猾面目。医校二年级全班并提议摘下协和会议室内的洛克菲勒的坐像，全场立刻报以热烈的掌声。最后学生会即在会上宣布接受各班的提议，致电联合国支持我伍修权代表的发言和痛斥奥斯汀的谬论。
    十三日上午，从病房、机器房、图书馆、宿舍、各科系和各工作部门涌来了从来没有这样多的教授、大夫、护士、职员、工友和男女同学们，汇集在Ｃ楼广场上，争先恐后地在支持我伍修权代表和抗议奥斯汀的两个电文上签名。于是，六百多人的雄壮大队和全市的游行队伍在首都的街道上汇合成了一支巨大的洪流，没有任何力量能够阻挡这个反诬蔑的抗议怒潮！
    在高度的爱国主义和反对帝国主义侵略的旗帜下，我们已经紧紧地团结起来了，公开而坚决地向全世界表明了我们胜利了的中国人民的立场，严重地打碎了美帝国主义的梦想。但这还不过是一个开始，正如我们的张鋆教务长所说的：过去，我们协和拿了美国资本家的钱，觉得很痛苦；从今天起，我们全协和的人已经表明了我们的态度，抗议了奥斯汀对我们的侮辱。我们以后还要拿出更多的实际行动来，继续坚持抗美斗争！
