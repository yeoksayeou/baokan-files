The failure of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea this time, it thought it was doing very well at first. Its approach was, on the one hand, to deceive the United Nations, driving the people of those countries to be cannon fodder for the United States, and on the other hand, to use Americans to wield power, wanting all the benefits of the aggression to belong to U.S. imperialism. Furthermore, the weapons and other military supplies needed for the war would all be sold by the United States, thinking the gains were real, which would be good for U.S. imperialism in the future. Who knew that China had a great, outstanding, and unparalleled hero, Mao Zedong, who was leading 475 million people here, who could not sit idly by. These 475 million people would organize the Volunteer Army to drive out all the demons summoned by U.S. imperialism, falsely calling themselves the "United Nations Forces." This great hero could not be stopped. Whether they are driven into the river or into the sea, these demons are absolutely not allowed to water their horses on the banks of China's Yalu River. Some might say that U.S. imperialism has controlled the United Nations for five years, and the world listens to its manipulation. Why has the aggression against Korea failed to this extent? I would say that the failure of U.S. imperialism has its origins: First, the Chinese Volunteer Army is brave and invincible, and none can stand against it. U.S. imperialism encountered this when it launched its aggression, so it naturally cannot sustain it. Second, Chinese leaders are blessed with popular support, and the new democracy will prevail. U.S. imperialism is in the final stage of capitalism, full of contradictions, and is bound to collapse. Third, U.S. imperialism is launching a distant expedition, which is a military taboo, and it is asking for trouble and cannot escape its sins. Fourth, U.S. imperialism is outnumbered and appears inferior, suffering a landslide defeat, with no time for regret. Fifth, U.S. imperialism is rich but weak, and the weak cannot defeat the strong, deserting the battlefield and unable to face the enemy, surrendering at the mere sight of the wind. From the above six points, the defeat of U.S. imperialism is inevitable. So, what will U.S. imperialism do? I say that U.S. imperialism will still manipulate the United Nations, saying that China is interfering, proposing the so-called thirteen-nation proposal and the so-called six-nation proposal. These words are all meant to confuse right and wrong, but in reality, they lead nowhere. Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism should sing a song of turning back and quickly withdraw all the invading United Nations forces. If not, then the invading forces can only flee to Japan, or else they will only be captured and taken prisoner.

    美帝侵朝失败的缘由及其末路
    符定一
    此次美帝侵朝失败的行动，当初他自以为做得很好，他的做法，一方面愚弄联合国，驱使那些国家的人民替美国当炮灰，又一方面使用美国人掌威权，想把侵略如有所得的利益，都为美帝所有，再一方面打仗要用的武器和其他军需品，货物皆归美国推销，自以为所得是实，这是他美帝将来的好处，那知道，中国有一个伟大卓绝，举世无双的英雄毛泽东，在这里领导四万七千五百万人，是不能坐视不理的，这四万七千五百万的人民要组织志愿军，要把美帝呼唤来的这些妖魔，伪称“联合国军队”者，概行赶出去，这位大英雄是不能禁阻的，赶到江里好，赶到海里也好，是决不准这些妖魔到中国的鸭绿江边饮马的。或曰五年以来美帝把持联合国，世界听其操纵，何以侵朝失败，一至于此？我就说美帝失败，实有由来：第一，中国志愿军英勇无敌，当之者靡，美帝发难遇此，自然不能支持。第二，中国领导者，得道多助，新民主制胜，美帝处资本主义最后阶段，充满矛盾，难免崩溃。第三，美帝劳师袭远，兵家所忌，自找没趣作孽不可逭也。第四，美帝寡不敌众，相形见绌，败如山倒，后悔无及。第五，美帝财多身弱，弱不敌强，临阵脱逃，无法当敌，望风而降。由上六端看来，美帝之败，势所必至。然则美帝将如之何？曰，美帝还是要操纵联合国，说什么中国干涉，就什么十三国提案，说什么六国提案，这些话，都是要淆乱是非，但是实际上却毫无出路。在这种情势之下，美帝应该唱一曲猛回头，把侵朝的联合军赶快全部撤回去，如若不然，则那侵略军只有逃亡至日本，再不然，则只有俘虏就擒而已。
