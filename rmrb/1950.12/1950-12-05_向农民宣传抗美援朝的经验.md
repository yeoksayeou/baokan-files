    Promoting the Experience of Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Farmers
    Lin Hong
    The Propaganda Team of a certain division of the Central Public Security Corps, responsible for guarding the capital, conducted propaganda on resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the country among the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing. Due to thorough preparations beforehand, especially a relatively detailed understanding of the characteristics of rural areas and the farmers' mindset, significant achievements were made in the short period of ten days of propaganda. The movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country has unfolded vigorously in the villages in this area.
    Sixteen groups participated in the propaganda work, each with three members. Almost every group had female comrades, which made it easier to approach women in rural areas. In addition, some comrades were responsible for writing slogans and creating cartoons and dramas to coordinate with the propaganda. The propaganda groups set out on November 12th and visited more than 340 households, held more than 20 small-scale meetings, and two mass rallies in about half a month. Some propagandists helped the villagers dig vegetable cellars, some helped turn over and dry sand, and some helped select wheat seeds. While working, the propagandists chatted casually with the villagers, talking about their current lives compared to their past, from the current close relationship between the military and the people to the bloody crimes of the Japanese soldiers, Kuomintang bandit troops, and American soldiers who bullied and harmed the Chinese people in the past. The villagers naturally poured out the suffering they had endured in the past. At this time, the propagandists explained the facts of the United States now invading Korea and our country. This inspired the villagers' hatred for American imperialism and their love for their liberated life and the people's motherland. After talking with the propagandists, many villagers raised their political awareness and actively carried out propaganda to relatives, friends, and neighbors, or actively helped the propagandists hold grievance meetings in the village.
    Here is a typical example. Ren Qi's group conducted propaganda in a natural village. After understanding the general situation, they visited a farmer named Li Shuxin. Li Shuxin was a deputy security group leader in the village, literate, and had a certain prestige among the masses. After meeting him, the propagandists asked for his opinions on the troops stationed in the area, whether there were any violations of discipline, and then asked about his life after liberation and the situation of paying public grain this year. Naturally, the conversation gradually turned to his past life, which evoked Li Shuxin's sad memories. During the Japanese occupation, his family had four houses and a stable. In order to build barracks, the Japanese devils forced the villagers to demolish their houses and move. One day, he was cutting grass at home when the Japanese soldiers came, and without saying a word, they gave him a deadline of three o'clock to vacate all the houses. He said: I didn't know what was going on, and my face turned pale with fright. Three hours later, the puppet police came and handed him a slip of paper, asking him to go to the police station to collect moving expenses and giving him another three hours to move. The whole family begged the Japanese devils and traitors bitterly, which naturally did not yield any results. In the end, he had to arrange for his wife and daughter to live with relatives separately. While he was using a cart to transport furniture and wood, the Japanese devils came again and climbed onto the house to demolish it. He said that his mood at that time was: sad, hateful, but there was no way, and he couldn't help but shed tears.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Li Shuxin still did not return to his old home and suffered further harm from the Kuomintang bandit troops and American soldiers. The watermelons in the field were not yet ripe, but the bandit troops picked and ate them. If you went to ask them, you would be punched or kicked. American soldiers rode horses in this area and trampled on his crops countless times. Before the liberation of Peiping, the west end of his house was the bandit troops, and the east end was the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the shooting was very fierce, and he placed his family in the cellar on the east end. Because he was afraid that the bandit troops would demolish the home he had worked so hard to rebuild for many years, he remained in the house. The defeated bandit troops ran into his house, defecated all over the yard, snatched and ate corn buns, and robbed many things, and even asked Li Shuxin to cook for them. Seeing that the situation was not good, he took the opportunity to run to the cellar on the east end. On the way, he suddenly heard someone calling from the east: "Old man, we are the Eighth Route Army, how many bandit troops are over there?"
    Li Shuxin said: I have lived for so long and have seen all kinds of troops, but I have never heard a soldier call me "old man." At that time, I was very happy in my heart; but I didn't know what kind of army the Eighth Route Army was, and I was still a little scared. But because I had a deep hatred for the bandit troops, I finally answered their questions.
    Before long, the People's Liberation Army attacked. Li Shuxin returned home and saw that it was full of the People's Liberation Army, and the yard had been cleaned. He was very moved and wanted to boil water for the troops to drink, but the comrades all scrambled to fetch firewood. After inquiring about his past, the People's Liberation Army soon helped him move back to his original village. Now he has built three brand-new houses. Li Shuxin said to the propagandists: Comrades, don't worry. Now that the American devils are going to invade our country again, in addition to doing a good job in production, striving to strengthen our national defense, I will also do my best to help you with propaganda work, to awaken everyone to defend our happy days and defend our motherland. The next morning after breakfast, when the propagandists arrived at his house, there were already eight or nine people in the room, waiting for the propagandists to hold a meeting. At the meeting, Li Shuxin took the lead in using his own painful experiences to enlighten everyone. Many people denounced the crimes of the Japanese and American imperialists in oppressing them and expressed their determination to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country. On the third day, the number of villagers participating in the small-scale meetings increased to more than 20, and finally, a successful general meeting of the entire natural village was held. Because the villagers had raised their awareness through grievance meetings, they showed great concern for the development of the current situation. Someone proposed at the meeting that the village should subscribe to a newspaper, which was immediately agreed upon by everyone. And the whole village spontaneously launched a movement to donate items to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist America and Aid Korea. Li Shuxin donated 100,000 yuan. As a result, more than 50 households in the whole village donated more than 590,000 yuan and more than 3,100 catties of sweet potatoes.
    A few days later, a mass rally to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country was held in the whole administrative village. The representative of Li Shuxin's natural village proposed at the meeting: Our village's entire peasantry is determined to take practical actions, such as doing a good job in production, producing more grain, paying more public grain, stepping up winter defense, and running winter schools well, so that all villagers are united, do not cause disputes, and help each other, to show our determination to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country, and challenge the brother villages.
    Why was this propaganda work able to achieve such results? The main reason is that the propaganda team was able to adopt propaganda methods that were easily accepted by farmers based on the characteristics of rural areas. Because the peasants have been oppressed for the longest time, their suffering is the deepest, and the reactionary government deprived the peasants of the opportunity to read and write, causing them to not be able to come into contact with new things, resulting in the conservativeness of the peasants' thinking. Especially on national affairs, although the average peasants have opinions, they do not dare to talk about them casually. Therefore, the propaganda team decided to adopt a propaganda method that did not involve lecturing the masses on great principles as soon as they met, nor did they hold group meetings or mass rallies as the first step as in big cities and big factories; but through helping the masses with work and soliciting the masses' opinions on the troops to conduct individual visits, the purpose was to use this very natural method to get close to the masses, enlighten the peasants to consciously complain, so as to achieve the extensive farmers' hatred of the American aggressors. At the same time, attention should be paid to cultivating activists during the visit, and mobilizing the masses through them to hold small-scale forums (i.e., the above-mentioned fragment meetings), and even mass rallies, to expand the propaganda effect.
    Secondly, this propaganda work made full preparations in advance based on the masses' ideological situation, and conducted experimental visits and propaganda among the masses. Before setting out for propaganda, the propaganda team conducted two weeks of current affairs study, and every comrade had a relatively clear and unified understanding of the significance of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the country in their thinking. The propaganda team invited the cadres of the village office and the public security police station to hold several forums. Through them, they understood the ideological situation of the masses; solicited their opinions on propaganda methods; and improved their understanding and cultivated them as activists in the propaganda through lectures and complaints. The propaganda team also specially sent people to visit six peasant families. In addition to collecting the ideological situation of the masses, the main purpose was to test which propaganda method was most easily accepted by the masses. After these two steps, after collecting the ideological situation of the masses, they immediately conducted analysis and research to see which problems were more common and concerned by the majority of the masses. Then, they collected materials from newspapers, magazines, and various documents, and after comprehensive research, they wrote a relatively detailed propaganda outline and distributed it to the propagandists for study. In this outline, specific facts and figures are given to illustrate: the bloody crimes of the US imperialists in consistently invading and harming the Chinese people; how much gold, dollars, airplanes, and artillery the US imperialists helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; the significance of the Chinese People's Volunteers resisting America and aiding Korea; the reactionary nature of US imperialism and its weaknesses in launching wars of aggression; the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp is stronger than the strength of the imperialist camp; and that the atomic bomb is not terrible, etc. The result of conducting propaganda based on such an outline and combining it with the ideological situation of the masses has achieved great results.

    向农民宣传抗美援朝的经验
    林洪
    警卫首都的中央公安纵队某师宣传队，在京郊驻地向农民进行了抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传。由于事前作了充分的准备工作，特别是对农村特点和农民的思想情况作了较详细的了解，在短短十几天的宣传中得到了显著成绩，这一带村庄的抗美援朝保家卫国运动已如火如荼地展开了。
    参加宣传工作的有十六个小组，每组三人。几乎每组都有女同志，这是为了在农村容易接近妇女。另外还有一部分同志担任写标语，以及负责漫画和戏剧工作，配合进行宣传。十一月十二日宣传小组出发，约半个月共访问了三百四十多户，召开了二十多次小片会、两次群众大会。有的宣传员帮助老乡挖菜窖，有的帮助翻晒沙子，有的帮助挑选麦种。在干活时，宣传员和老乡慢慢地拉闲大，从现在的生活谈到过去的生活，从现在亲密的军民关系，谈到过去日本兵、国民党匪军和美国兵欺压残害中国人民的血腥罪行，老乡们便自然地把过去所受的痛苦都倾诉出来。这时，宣传员就把现在美国又来侵略朝鲜和我国的事实加以说明。这样就启发了老乡们对于美帝的仇恨，对于解放后的生活和人民祖国的热爱。许多老乡和宣传员谈话后，提高了政治觉悟，纷纷向亲戚朋友和邻居进行宣传，或者积极帮助宣传员在村中召开诉苦会。
    这里有一个典型的例子。任齐的小组，在一个自然村进行宣传。他们在了解了一般情况后，访问了一个叫李树新的农民。李树新是村里的一个治安副组长，识一些字，在群众中有一定的威信。宣传员和他见面后，征求他对部队驻在这一带的意见，是否有违犯纪律的事情，然后问到他在解放后的生活、今年缴纳公粮的情形。很自然地，谈话逐渐转到他过去的生活，于是就勾起了李树新的伤心事。在日寇统治时期，他家共有四间房和一个马棚。日本鬼子为了建造兵营，强迫村里的人拆房搬家。有一天，他正在家里铡草，日本兵来了，什么话也没有说，就限定他在三点钟内把全部房子腾出来。他说：我不知道是什么事情，我的脸都吓白了。三个钟点后，来了伪警察，交给他一张条子，要他到派出所去领搬家费，并且再限他三个钟点搬家。全家人苦苦地向日本鬼子和汉奸哀求，这自然不会有结果。最后，他只好把自己的媳妇女儿分别安置到亲戚家。当他正在用大车搬运家具和木料的时候，日本鬼子又来了，爬上房就去拆房子。他说，我那时的心情是：难过、痛恨，但又没有办法，忍不住掉下了眼泪。
    抗战胜利后，李树新仍然没有回到自己的旧家园，又遭受到国民党匪军和美国兵的残害。地里的西瓜还没有熟，匪军给摘着吃了，要是去问他，不是拳打，就是脚踢。美国兵在这一带跑马，曾经无数次地踏毁了他的庄稼。北平解放前，他家的西头是匪军，东头就是解放军。那时枪打得很厉害，他把家里人安置在东头的地窖里。因为害怕匪军拆掉他多年辛苦重建的家园，他仍然留在房里。败退下来的匪军跑进他家里，拉了一院子屎，抢吃了窝窝头，抢去了许多东西，还叫李树新给作饭。他看势头不对，乘机会跑到东头的地窖里。半路上，忽然听见东面有人叫：“老大爷，我们是八路军，那面有多少匪军？”
    李树新说：我活了这么大年纪，看见过各种各样的军队，从来没有听见一个当兵的叫我“老大爷”。那时，我心里很高兴；但是我不知道八路军是什么样的军队，还有点怕。不过因为我对匪军有很深的仇恨，我终于回答了他们的问题。
    没有多久，解放军攻过来了。李树新回到家里一看，满是解放军，院子已打扫得干干净净。他很感动，要给军队烧水喝，同志们都争着去抱柴。在问明了他过去的事情后，不久，解放军就帮助他搬回了原来的村庄。现在他已经盖起了三间崭新的房子。李树新向宣传员说：同志，你放心。现在美国鬼子又要来侵略咱们的国家，我除了好好生产、努力增强国防力量以外，还要尽力帮你们搞宣传工作，要唤醒大家都来保卫咱们幸福的日子，保卫咱们的祖国。第二天早饭后，宣传员到他家的时候，屋里早有八九个人，正等着宣传员来开会。会上，李树新带头用自己的痛苦遭遇来启发大家，许多人都控诉了日美帝国主义者欺压他们的罪行，表示了抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。第三天，参加小片会的老乡增加到二十多人，最后成功地召开了全自然村的大会。由于老乡们通过诉苦会提高了觉悟，对时局的发展表现得非常关心。有人在会上提出，村里应该订一份报纸，立刻得到了大家的同意。并且全村自发地掀起了捐献物品慰劳朝鲜人民军和中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队的运动。李树新捐了十万元。结果全村五十多户人家，共捐了五十九万多元和白薯三千一百多斤。
    过了几天，全行政村召开了抗美援朝保家卫国的群众大会。李树新那个自然村的代表在会上提出：我村全体农民决以搞好生产，多打粮食，多缴公粮，加紧冬防，办好冬学，全体村民团结一致，不闹意见，互相帮助的实际行动，来表示我们抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，并向兄弟村挑战。
    这一次的宣传工作为什么能够取得这样的成绩呢？主要的原因是，该宣传队能够根据农村的特点采用了容易为农民所接受的宣传方法。因为农民所受的压迫最长，他们的痛苦最深，反动政府又剥夺了农民读书识字的机会，使他们不能接触新鲜事物，造成了农民思想上的保守性。特别是国家大事，一般农民虽有意见，却不敢随便谈。因此，宣传队决定采用的宣传方法，不是一见面就向群众说大道理，也不象在大城市和大工厂中，头一炮就召开小组会或群众大会；而是通过帮助群众干活和征求群众对部队的意见进行个别访问，目的是利用这种很自然的方式和群众接近，启发农民自觉地诉苦，借以达到广大农民对美国侵略者的仇视。同时在访问中应注意培养积极分子，通过他们动员群众，召开小型座谈会（即上述的片会），以至群众大会，扩大宣传效力。
    其次是这一次的宣传工作，事先根据群众的思想情况，作了充分的准备工作，并到群众中作了试验性的访问宣传。该宣传队在出发宣传之前，曾进行了两个星期的时事学习，每一个同志在思想上对抗美援朝保家卫国的意义，都有了比较清楚和统一的认识。宣传队先后邀请村公所和公安派出所的干部们开了几次座谈会。通过他们了解了群众的思想情况；征求了他们对宣传方法的意见；并通过讲解和诉苦的方式，提高了他们的认识，培养他们作为宣传中的积极分子。宣传队还特别派人访问了六家农民，除收集群众的思想情况外，主要是试验那一种宣传方式最容易为群众所接受。经过这两个步骤，把群众的思想情况收集起来后，立刻进行了分析研究，看看那一些问题比较普遍，为大多数群众所关心。再从报纸杂志和各种文件上收集材料，经综合研究后写成比较详细的宣传提纲，发给宣传员们学习。在这一提纲中，举出具体事实和数字，说明：美帝一贯侵略残害中国人民的血腥罪行；美帝帮助了蒋介石匪帮多少金元、飞机和大炮；中国人民志愿抗美援朝的意义；美帝的反动本质和它发动侵略战争的弱点；世界和平民主阵营的力量较帝国主义阵营的力量强大；以及原子弹并不可怕等。根据这样的提纲，结合群众的思想情况进行宣传的结果，收到了很大的成效。
