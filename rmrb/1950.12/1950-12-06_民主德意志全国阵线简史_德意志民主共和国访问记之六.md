    A Brief History of the National Front of Democratic Germany
    Notes from a Visit to the German Democratic Republic, Part 6
    The history of the National Front of Democratic Germany is the history of the German people's struggle to restore and safeguard Germany's unification and to strive for the early conclusion of a fair peace treaty. In early December 1947, during the London Conference of Foreign Ministers, more than 2,000 representatives from all provinces of Germany convened the First German People's Congress in Berlin. The representatives expressed to the Allied powers the German people's desire for unification and peace. This meeting gave rise to the powerful People's Congress Movement, which was not limited to East Germany but spread throughout West Germany.
    Due to the breach of contract and inaction of the then US Secretary of State Marshall, the London Conference failed. Subsequently, on January 7, 1948, the US and British imperialists violated the Potsdam Agreement and independently established an economic committee in the British and American occupied zones, shocking the German people who longed for economic and political unification. Thereafter, the imperialists continued to implement their policy of division, creating a new and concerning situation for Germany. The Second German People's Congress was then convened on March 17 and 18, 1948. This meeting determined the outline of the two-year plan and elected the All-German People's Council as an organ for discussing and deciding on the People's Congress Movement. Entrusted by the People's Congress, the All-German People's Council, in accordance with the people's desire to unify Germany, also undertook the responsibility of drafting the constitution of the German Democratic Republic.
    The German people's desire to oppose division and demand unification can be seen from the plebiscite held from May 23 to June 13, 1948. Although the Western occupying authorities obstructed the West German people from expressing their opinions in various ways, 15 million people signed in 20 days, demanding the realization of Germany's unification and opposing division. The German People's Council submitted these signatures to the Allied Control Council, requesting that it allow the German people to exercise self-determination, but the Western occupying authorities turned a blind eye to this.
    Throughout 1948, the imperialists' policy of dividing Germany became increasingly obvious: Hitler's former arms dealers and other economic supporters, the financial chiefs during the war... all became active again under the wings of the imperialist generals, restoring their old authority. It is not surprising that these people were willing to serve as tools for the US, British, and French imperialists to divide Germany. In the summer of 1948, Britain and the United States violated the agreement and unilaterally implemented "currency reform" in West Germany, dividing Germany's economy into two; subsequently, they implemented the so-called "Occupation Statute," illegally established the "Bonn" puppet government, and promulgated the "constitution" dictated to Adenauer. In this way, the division of Germany finally became a reality.
    The German People's Council lodged a serious protest with the Western occupiers. By October 22, 1948, the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Council had drafted the constitution of Democratic Germany and submitted it to the German people for public discussion. After 500 revisions and corrections, it was unanimously adopted by the People's Council on March 19, 1949.
    During this period, the imperialists' policy of division not only plunged West Germany into a difficult situation but also seriously threatened the economic construction of East Germany. In view of this situation, the Third All-German People's Congress was convened on May 28 and 29, 1949, to discuss how to save the German people from their plight.
    The representatives of the Third People's Congress were elected through a universal and direct method. The list of candidates was jointly proposed by various parties and mass organizations. The results of the voting on May 15 and 16, 1949, proved that 66.1 percent of the people supported the purpose of the "People's Congress Movement," that is to say, the People's Congress was composed of more than two-thirds of the legitimate people's representatives. These representatives issued a declaration to the people of the whole country, commented on the Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Paris on May 23, and determined the main purpose of the "People's Congress Movement" as follows:
    "The entire German people unite together, under the banner of the National Front, to strive for the unification of Germany, demand that all occupying forces withdraw from Germany, and conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible."
    At this People's Congress, the constitution of Democratic Germany drafted by the People's Council was passed with 2,087 votes against one.
    The German people saw clearly the path they should take. After the Paris-Prague World Peace Congress in April 1949, the development of German peace forces and the "People's Congress Movement" became increasingly rapid. On October 2, 1949, "World Peace Day," the German people once again enthusiastically expressed their will to support world peace and demanded that the People's Council not remain silent about the West German puppet government that the imperialists had arbitrarily organized. At this time, the Soviet government presented a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, pointing out their various violations of the treaty. From factories, cities, and villages, the German people issued a demand to organize an independent democratic government. The All-German People's Council, as the highest organ of public opinion, met on October 7, 1949, and decided to reorganize into the "Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic." From that time on, the constitution of the German Democratic Republic came into effect, and the true German democratic government was born.
    Like other truly democratic constitutions, the constitution of the German Democratic Republic guarantees that the people control all state institutions and fully enjoy all democratic rights. Through the elected parliament, the people have all the power. According to the constitution, all political parties participating in the government must be responsible to the people, and so-called "opposition parties" that are irresponsible and only represent their own interests are not allowed in the political parties. Every member of the People's Chamber must sincerely serve the people.
    On October 10, 1949, General Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany, transferred administrative power to the German Democratic Republic. On October 11, Wilhelm Pieck was elected President. The Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Grotewohl, was sworn in. At the Provisional People's Chamber on October 12, Premier Grotewohl announced: "The establishment of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic indicates that the German democratic forces are determined to overcome all difficulties and take their own destiny into their own hands." "Our new path is the path of democracy, peace, and friendship with the people of all countries." After thanking the great Soviet Union for its help, Grotewohl pointed out: On this new path, the German people are not alone. They have powerful friends: the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Europe, the People's Republic of China, and all peace-loving and progressive people in the world. "Friendship with the Soviet Union has given us the strength to complete the great task of national construction undertaken by the government." He also explained that the source of the German Democratic Republic government's own strength lies in striving to unite all true Germans in the National Front.
    Due to practical needs, the Secretariat of the German People's Congress convened a meeting in Berlin on January 7, 1950, and decided to rename itself the Secretariat of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic. Following requests from the people's committees in various regions, the People's Congress Movement was changed to the "National Front of the German Democratic Republic."
    On February 3, 1950, representatives of men, women, and youth from all walks of life in Germany (including representatives from West Germany and West Berlin) organized the "National Committee of the National Front" as the highest leading body for the German people to strive for unification and independence. All German patriots, national-minded intellectuals, and entrepreneurs, regardless of party affiliation, became members of the National Front. The broad nature of the National Front can be seen from the program decided by the Second Meeting of the National Committee of the National Front on February 15 of the same year.
    On the day I arrived in Berlin, the Third Meeting of the National Committee of the National Front was in progress. The situation at that time was: the imperialist occupiers, against the will of the people, included West Germany in the so-called "European Council"; West German industry, especially heavy industry, fell into the hands of Wall Street warmongers through the "Schuman Plan." There can be no other explanation for this other than to plot to make West Germany a US base for aggression and a colony. In order to further strengthen the German people's struggle against imperialist aggression, various anti-fascist parties established the "Democratic Bloc" in order to put forward a common election program and a unified candidate list in the nationwide election on October 15. The letter issued to the German people pointed out:
    "...In order to consolidate world peace, to strengthen the democratic order, and for the freedom and independence of Germany, to make Germany follow the path of progress, the National Committee of the National Front calls on millions of activists of the National Front Committee to prepare for the future elections...A unified and peaceful democratic Germany, the rapid conclusion of a fair peace treaty—this is the direction of our struggle."
    (Editor's Note: The general election of the People's Chamber and local parliaments and governments at all levels of the German Democratic Republic was held and successfully concluded on October 15. A total of 12,139,932 citizens participated in the election, accounting for 98.44 percent of the total number of voters, and 12,088,745 people voted for the joint candidates of the National Front of Democratic Germany.)

    民主德意志全国阵线简史
    德意志民主共和国访问记之六
    民主德国全国阵线的历史，就是德国人民为了恢复和保障德国的统一、争取早日缔结公平和约的奋斗史。一九四七年十二月初，正值伦敦三国外长会议期间，全德各省代表二千余人在柏林召开了第一次德国人民代表大会。代表们向盟国表示了德国需要统一与和平的意愿。这次会议产生了强大的人民代表大会运动，它不仅限于东德，而且普及于西德各地。
    由于当时美国国务卿马歇尔的违约和怠工，伦敦会议失败了。接着，一九四八年一月七日，美英帝国主义又破坏了波茨坦协定，单独设立了英美两占领区的经济委员会，殷望经济与政治上统一的德国人民，为之震惊。此后，帝国主义者继续执行其分裂政策，造成德国的新的可虑的局面。第二次德国人民代表大会便在一九四八年三月十七、十八两天召开了。这次会议确定了两年计划的纲要，并选出了全德人民委员会，作为商讨与决定人民会议运动的机关。全德人民委员会受人民代表大会的委托，依照人民要求统一德国的愿望，同时担负了草拟德意志民主共和国宪法的责任。
    德国人民反对分裂要求统一的愿望，可从一九四八年五月二十三日到六月十三日举行的民意测验中看出来。虽然西方占领当局的多方阻挠使西德人民无法表示其意见，但二十天里，就有一千五百万人签字，要求实现德国的统一，反对分裂。德国人民委员会把这些签名交给盟军管制委员会，请其允许德国人民自决，但西方占领当局对此却漠然置之。
    一九四八年整年当中，帝国主义者分裂德国的政策越来越明显：昔日希特勒的军火商和其他经济上的支持者，战时的财政首脑们……都在帝国主义将军们的卵翼下重新活跃起来，恢复了旧日的权威地位。这些人甘心充当美、英、法帝国主义者分裂德国的工具，是不足为奇的。一九四八年夏天，英、美违约单独在西德实行了“币制改革”，把德国的经济截为两断；随后又实行所谓“占领法规”，非法设立“波恩”傀儡政府，并颁布其口授阿登纳的“宪法”，这样，德国的分裂最后成为事实了。
    德国人民委员会对此向西方占领者提出了严重抗议。到一九四八年十月二十二日，人民委员会的宪法起草委员会已将民主德国宪法拟就，交德国人民公开讨论。经过了五百次的修改与校正，于一九四九年三月十九日由人民委员会一致通过。
    在此期间，帝国主义者的分裂政策不仅使西德陷于艰难的局面，而且使东德的经济建设遭受了严重的威胁。鉴于此种情势，第三次全德人民代表大会乃于一九四九年五月二十八、九两日召开，商讨如何挽救德国人民的厄运。
    第三次人民代表大会的代表，是经过普遍与直接的方式选举出来的。代表的候选名单，由各党派、各群众团体共同提出。一九四九年五月十五、十六两日投票的结果，证明有百分之六十六点一的人民赞成“人民代表大会运动”的宗旨，就是说，人民代表大会是三分之二以上合法的人民代表所组成的。这些代表们向全国人民发表宣言，对五月二十三日在巴黎举行的外长会议有所评议，并确定“人民代表大会运动”的主要宗旨如下：
    “全德国人民一致团结起来，在全国阵线的旗帜下，为统一德国而奋斗，要求占领军一律撤出德国，迅速签订和约。”
    在这次人民代表大会上，人民委员会所草拟的民主德国的宪法，以二○八七票对一票被通过。
    德国人民看清了他们所应走的道路。在一九四九年四月巴黎——布拉格世界保卫和平大会之后，德国和平势力与“人民代表大会运动”的发展，愈益迅速。一九四九年十月二日“世界和平日”那天，德国人民再度热烈地表示了拥护世界和平的意志，并要求人民委员会对帝国主义者所擅自组织的西德傀儡政府不能缄默。此时，苏联政府对美、英、法三国政府提出照会，指出其违反条约的种种事实。从工厂、城市和乡村里，德国人民发出组织独立的民主政府的要求。作为最高民意机关的全德人民委员会乃于一九四九年十月七日开会决定改组为“德意志民主共和国临时人民议会”。从那时起，德意志民主共和国宪法生效，真正的德国民主政府诞生了。
    正和其他真正民主的宪法一样，德意志民主共和国宪法保障了人民控制一切国家机构，并充分享有一切民主权利。经过民选的议会，人民掌握了一切权力。按照宪法，所有参加政府的政党，必须对人民负责，不容许政党中有不负责任、仅仅代表自己利益的所谓“反对派”。人民议会的每个议员，必须诚心诚意为人民服务。
    一九四九年十月十日，德境苏占领军总司令崔可夫上将将行政权移交给德意志民主共和国。十月十一日，威廉·皮克被选为总统。以格罗提渥为首的德意志民主共和国临时政府宣誓就职。在十月十二日临时人民议会上，总理格罗提渥宣布：“德意志民主共和国临时政府的成立，表示德国民主势力决心克服一切困难，并将自己的命运掌握在自己手里。”“我们的新的道路，就是民主、和平及与各国人民友谊的道路。”在感谢伟大苏联的帮助后，格罗提渥指出：在这个新的道路上，德国人民不是孤单的。他们有强大的朋友苏联、欧洲新民主主义国家、中华人民共和国和世界一切爱好和平与进步的人民。“与苏联的友好，就给了我们完成政府所担负的伟大建国任务的力量。”他并说明德意志民主共和国政府自身力量的源泉，在于力求团结一切真正德国人的全国阵线。
    由于事实上的需要，德国人民代表大会秘书处于一九五○年一月七日在柏林召开会议，决定易名为德意志民主共和国全国阵线秘书处，并依照各地区人民委员会的请求，将人民代表大会运动改为“德意志民主共和国全国阵线”。
    一九五○年二月三日，德国各界的男、女和青年代表（包括西德及西柏林的代表）组织了“全国阵线全国委员会”，作为全德人民争取统一与独立的最高领导机构。一切德国的爱国人士及抱有民族意识的知识分子和企业家，不分党派，都成为全国阵线的会员。从同年二月十五日全国阵线全国委员会第二次会议所决定的纲领中，可以看出全国阵线的广泛性。
    我到达柏林的那天，全国阵线全国委员会的第三次会议正在进行中。当时的情况是：帝国主义占领者违反人民的意志，把西德加入到所谓“欧洲委员会”；西德的工业，特别是重工业，则通过“舒曼计划”落入华尔街战争贩子们的手里。这样，除了阴谋使西德成为美国侵略基地和殖民地外，不能有别的解释。为了进一步加强德国人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，各反法西斯政党成立“民主集团”，以便在十月十五日全国境内大选时，提出共同的选举纲领和统一的竞选名单。在所发的告德国人民书中指出：
    “……为了巩固世界和平，为了加强民主的秩序，为了德意志的自由与独立，使德国循着进步的道路走，全国阵线全国委员会号召千百万全国阵线委员会的积极分子起来筹备未来的选举……统一与和平民主的德国，迅速订立公平的和约——这就是我们奋斗的方向。”
    （编者按：德意志民主共和国人民议会以及各级地方议会和政府的普选，已于十月十五日举行并胜利结束。参加选举的公民共一千二百十三万九千九百三十二人，占全体选民人数百分之九八·四四，投票选举民主德国全国阵线共同候选人的有一千二百零八万八千七百四十五人。）
