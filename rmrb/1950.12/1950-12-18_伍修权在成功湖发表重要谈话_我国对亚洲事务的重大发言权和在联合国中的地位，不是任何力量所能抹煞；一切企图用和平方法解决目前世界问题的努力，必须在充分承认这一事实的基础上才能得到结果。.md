Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: New York Dispatch: Wu Xiuquan, Special Representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Security Council to Accuse the United States of Armed Aggression Against Our Territory of Taiwan and to Participate in the Political and Security Committee's Discussion of the Case of Accusation Against the United States for Aggression Against China, met with reporters at Lake Success yesterday (16th) at 3 p.m. and delivered the following speech:

	We have come to strive for peace. In order to stop aggression and restore peace, we have proposed to the United Nations Security Council to take effective measures to compel the United States government to withdraw its armed forces that are aggressing against our territory of Taiwan, to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Korea, and to withdraw all its armed forces that are interfering in Korea. Unfortunately, though not unexpectedly, the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, has rejected this reasonable peace proposal of our government. We express our resolute opposition and protest against this.

	Our government has also accepted the invitation of the United Nations and sent me to participate in the discussion of the Political and Security Committee of the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations regarding the case of the Soviet representative's accusation against the United States for aggression against China. Although the Soviet representative has striven for the Political and Security Committee to continue discussing this case, the Political and Security Committee has not continued to discuss this major case of accusation to this day due to the manipulation of the United States government. Thus, although we were invited and waited for a long time, we have not yet had the opportunity to speak. However, we believe that the voice of the People's Republic of China should be heard by the world. Therefore, I am distributing here my speech that I prepared to deliver in the Political and Security Committee. At the same time, we express our indignation at the United States government's manipulation of the United Nations in such a way that we do not have the opportunity to speak.

	The small ruling clique in the United States stubbornly refuses to recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China, obliterating its decisive right to speak and represent on all major Far Eastern issues related to China; they stubbornly insist on flagrantly interfering in China's internal affairs, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary remnant clique, which is spurned by the people of China and the world, and openly aggressing against China, pursuing a policy of enmity with the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China. But facts have proven that the People's Republic of China, its significant voice on Asian affairs, and its position in the United Nations cannot be obliterated by any force. All efforts to resolve current major world problems peacefully can only be achieved on the basis of full recognition of this fact.

	We have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and its localization. Therefore, we insist on the proposition that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and that the Korean people should solve the Korean issue themselves. However, the United States ruling clique, while carrying out armed intervention in Korea, is carrying out armed aggression against Taiwan, bombing the Chinese mainland, and expanding its aggression in East Asia. Now, when peace-loving people all over the world are demanding a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, the US-British bloc wants to retain aggressive troops and aggressive actions in Korea, continue to occupy Chinese Taiwan, and intensify its aggressive and war policies against the world. This can be proven by President Truman's threatening statement to use atomic bombs, by the joint communique of President Truman and Prime Minister Attlee, and by the US government's declaration of a national emergency. From this, one can understand that Mr. Austin's true intention in advocating a ceasefire first in Korea is to demand that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers be tied up, so that the US invading army can continue its aggression in Korea, that Taiwan can still be occupied by the US armed forces, that Japanese militarism can be restored by MacArthur, and that the American people can be driven into the abyss of war at the will of the American ruling clique. General Marshall has helped Chiang Kai-shek to carry out this trick many times in China, so the Chinese people are not unfamiliar with it. We are willing to expose this conspiracy to the kind people of the world.

	The people of our country love peace and fervently hope to build their own country peacefully without aggression and threat. The government of our country has consistently advocated peaceful methods to solve the current major problems in the world, first of all, to solve the Far East problem caused by the policy and actions of the US ruling clique in armed aggression against China and Korea. Although the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, has rejected our basic proposal for a peaceful solution to the Far East problem this time, we will still make every effort to strive for a peaceful solution to the Far East problem and are willing to try to persuade the Chinese People's Volunteers to end as soon as possible the military actions that they have been forced to take together with the Korean People's Army to resist the US invading army.

	We are sincerely grateful for the friendly welcome we have received from the American people in various ways this time. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and American people, despite being threatened by the US ruling clique's policy and actions of aggression against China, will surely be carried through with the joint efforts of the peace-loving Chinese and American people.

    伍修权在成功湖发表重要谈话
    我国对亚洲事务的重大发言权和在联合国中的地位，不是任何力量所能抹煞；一切企图用和平方法解决目前世界问题的努力，必须在充分承认这一事实的基础上才能得到结果。
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约讯：我中华人民共和国出席联合国安全理事会控诉美国武装侵略我国领土台湾并参加政治安全委员会讨论控诉美国侵略中国案的特派代表伍修权，于昨（十六）日下午三时，在成功湖招待记者，发表谈话如下：
    我们是争取和平来的。为了制止侵略和恢复和平，我们向联合国安全理事会提议，采取有效措施；使美国政府撤退其侵略我国领土台湾的武装力量，停止干涉朝鲜内政，撤退其一切干涉朝鲜的武装力量。但是不幸地，虽然并非是出乎意料之外地，联合国安全理事会，在美英集团的操纵之下拒绝了我国政府这个合理的和平的建议，对比，我们表示坚决的反对和抗议。
    我国政府又接受联合国之邀请，派遣我参加联合国第五届大会政治安全委员会关于苏联代表所提出的控诉美国侵略中国一案的讨论。苏联代表虽然力争政治安全委员会应该继续讨论此案，但由于美国政府的操纵，政治安全委员会一直到今天还没有继续讨论这一重大控诉案。这样我们虽然被邀请了来，而且等待了很长的时间，我们却至今没有得到说话的机会。但是，我们以为中华人民共和国的声音是应该被全世界听到的，因此，我把我准备在政治安全委员会发表的发言，在这里分发给大家。同时，我们对于美国政府如此操纵联合国，不让我们有发言的机会，表示愤慨。
    美国少数的统治集团执拗地拒绝承认中华人民共和国的存在，抹杀它对所有和中国有关的远东重大问题的决定性的发言权和代表权；他们执拗地坚持横蛮干涉中国内政，支持全中国和全世界人民所唾弃的蒋介石反动残余集团，公开侵略中国，以与中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民为敌的政策。但事实证明，中华人民共和国，它对于亚洲事务的重大发言权及它在联合国中的地位，不是任何力量所能抹煞的。一切企图用和平方法解决目前世界重大问题的努力，只有在充分地承认这一事实的基础上，才有可能得到结果。
    我们历来主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并使朝鲜问题局部化的，故我们坚持一切外国军队撤离朝鲜，由朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题的主张；但美国统治集团却在武装干涉朝鲜的同时实行武装侵略台湾轰炸中国本土并扩大在东亚的侵略。现在在全世界爱好和平的人民都要求和平解决朝鲜问题的时候，美英集团却要在朝鲜保留侵略军队和侵略行动，继续侵占中国台湾，并对全世界加紧进行其侵略政策和战争政策。这从杜鲁门总统恐吓使用原子弹的声明中，从杜鲁门总统、艾德礼首相的联合公报中，从美国政府宣布将全国处于紧急状态中就可得到证明，并从而可以懂得奥斯汀先生所赞成的在朝鲜首先停战的真正意图就是要求朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队束手，以让美国侵略军在朝鲜继续侵略，就是要求台湾仍然被美国武装侵占，就是要求日本军国主义可以被麦克阿瑟重新恢复起来，就是要求美国人民可以被美国统治集团为所欲为地驱入到战争深渊。这种圈套马歇尔将军曾经帮助蒋介石在中国多次摆布过，故中国人民对之并不生疏，我们愿向世界的善良人民揭穿他们这个诡计。
    我国人民热爱和平，热烈希望能在不受侵略和威胁的状况下和平建设自己的国家。我国政府一贯主张和平的方法解决目前世界上各种重大问题，首先是解决由于美国统治集团武装侵略中国和朝鲜的政策与行动所引起的远东问题。这一次联合国安全理事会虽然在美英集团的操纵之下拒绝了我国和平解决远东问题的基本提案，我们仍将尽一切努力争取远东问题的和平解决，并愿设法劝告中国人民志愿部队被迫与朝鲜人民军一道抵抗美国侵略军的军事行动早日得到结束。
    我们这一次来受到美国人民用各种方式表现出来的友谊的欢迎，我们表示恳切的感谢。我们深信，中美两国人民之间的友谊，尽管目前是在受着美国统治集团侵略中国的政策和行动的威胁，在爱好和平的中美两国人民的共同努力之下，是一定能够贯彻下去的。
