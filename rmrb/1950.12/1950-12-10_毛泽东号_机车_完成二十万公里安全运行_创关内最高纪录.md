    "Mao Zedong" Locomotive
     Completes 200,000 Kilometers of Safe Operation
     Setting the Highest Record Within the Pass
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The national locomotive banner, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, following its successful "over-axle" haulage on the 17th of last month, successfully completed 200,000 kilometers of safe, accident-free operation on the 7th of this month, setting the highest record within the Pass. Railway workers and students in the Fengtai area once again welcomed this ever-victorious army on the production front with a lively atmosphere of fluttering red flags and deafening drums and gongs. As the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, personally driven by the old hero Li Yong, steadily entered the platform, all the crew members on the locomotive and the welcoming ranks below were completely filled with earth-shaking cheers and applause.
    This victory of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive in completing 200,000 kilometers of safe operation, from January 1947 to December 7, 1950, lasted a total of 35 months and 7 days. During this long period of operation, there were no accidents due to negligence, achieving both "speed" and "stability." Now, all the crew members of the locomotive are full of confidence and want to continue to advance towards the goal of 300,000 kilometers of safe travel.
    After getting off the locomotive, the old hero Li Yong said to everyone on the spot: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our working class unite as one, exert infinite wisdom and creativity, and do a good job in the cause of the people." The Mao Zedong locomotive ㄇㄎ—304 was brought into the Pass from the Northeast in 1949 and immediately took the lead in the Tianjin Railway Bureau in demonstrating the contract responsibility system with a record of 139,000 safe kilometers. It played a significant role in promoting this system within the Pass. At that time, the general crew members of the Tianjin Railway Bureau did not understand this new working system well and were unwilling to implement it. However, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive patiently helped and united the vast number of crew members in actual work, and finally promoted the contract responsibility system to the entire Tianjin Railway Bureau. Since the "Mao Zedong" locomotive implemented the contract responsibility system on July 1, 1947, it has saved the country a total of more than 400 tons of machine coal and more than 300 catties of oil in 42 months, preventing 27 accidents. Recently, the locomotive has once again responded to the call to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical actions, calling on locomotives across the country to implement over-axle operation and taking the lead itself. In November, it over-axled a total of 3,050 tons, and the technical speed exceeded the bureau's standard by 6 percent, gloriously practicing the patriotic slogan put forward by the locomotive to save transportation capacity for the country.

    “毛泽东号”机车
     完成二十万公里安全运行       
     创关内最高纪录
    【本报讯】全国机车旗帜“毛泽东号”继上月十七日“超轴”牵引成功以来，又于本月七日胜利完成了二十万公里安全无事故的运行，创关内最高纪录。丰台地区铁路员工和学生，又一次地以红旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天的热烈情绪来欢迎这支在生产战线上的常胜军。当李永老英雄亲自驾驶的“毛泽东号”机车安稳地驶进站台的时候，机车上的全体乘务员和下面的欢迎行列都完全洋溢在一片震天的欢呼与鼓掌声中。
    这次“毛泽东号”机车胜利完成二十万公里安全运行，从一九四七年一月开始，到一九五○年十二月七日为止，在历时共三十五个月零七天的长期运转中，没有出过责任事故，做到了“快”与“稳”。现该机车全体乘务员充满信心的要继续向安全走行三十万公里目标前进。
    李永老英雄在下机车后当场对大家说：“只有在共产党的领导下，我们工人阶级才能团结一致，发挥无穷的智慧与创造性，搞好人民的事业。”毛泽东号冖ㄎ——三○四号机车是在一九四九年从东北进关，当时即带着十三万九千安全公里的纪录到天津局作包乘负责制的示范。它对于关内推行这一制度起了重大的推动作用。当时天津局的一般乘务员对这一新的工作制度了解不够，不愿实行。但“毛泽东号”机车在实际工作中耐心帮助和团结广大乘务员，终于把包乘负责制推广到天津局全路。“毛泽东号”机车从一九四七年七月一日实行包乘负责制后，四十二个月里共替国家节省了机煤四百多吨，油三百多斤，防止事故二十七件。最近该机车又以实际行动响应抗美援朝，号召全国机车、同时自己首先实行超轴运转，在十一月份中，共计超轴三○五○吨，技术速度超过局定标准百分之六，光荣地实践该机车提出的为国家节省运输力的爱国主义的口号。（窦圻、姚克）
