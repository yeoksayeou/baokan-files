    Engineer Chen Yonggui of Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory
    Extracts Emery from Waste Grinding Wheels
    [This Dispatch] Engineer Chen Yonggui of the Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory, under the Northeast Machinery Bureau, successfully researched and manufactured emery from waste products, creating wealth worth over 20 billion Northeast currency for the country. The factory's main raw material, emery, cannot currently be manufactured domestically and relies on foreign imports, which often cannot guarantee timely supply, frequently leading to work stoppages and material shortages. This year, a plan was even drawn up to reduce production by half. Encouraged by factory director Gao Zhutian, Chen Yonggui was determined to trial-produce emery from waste grinding wheels. Chen Yonggui and other technicians worked diligently on research, lasting a year, not disheartened by numerous failures. Finally, they used a large batch of leftover waste grinding wheels, crushed them, removed by-products from the sand particles, washed with water, sieved, and extracted the iron content from the sand, producing recycled emery.

    利用废砂轮提制金钢砂
    【本报讯】东北机械局所属苏家屯砂轮厂工程师陈永贵，利用废品，研究制造金钢砂成功，给国家创造了东北币二百余亿元的财富。该厂所用主要原料金钢砂，目前国内尚不能制造，靠外来输入，常不能及时保证供应，往往陷于停工待料，今年曾订出减产一半的计划。陈永贵受到厂长高柱天的鼓励，决心利用废砂轮试制金钢砂。陈永贵和其他技术人员苦心研究，历时一年，中经多次失败亦不灰心，终于利用过去剩下来的大批废砂轮，经过粉碎，除去砂粒中的副产物，水洗、过筛、提出砂中所含铁质等过程，制出了再生金钢砂。
