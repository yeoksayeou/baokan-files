    Northeast Holds Conference of Veterans and Model Workers
    Determining Production Tasks to Move Towards Model Villages, Striving for Production, Uniting the Masses, and Resolutely Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    [By Our Own Correspondent] The first conference of labor models from veterans and demobilized soldiers (referred to as veterans) in Northeast China was held in Shenyang from November 25th to December 1st. The conference was attended by 171 representatives of veterans, loyal soldiers of the people, from all over the Northeast, and 70 observers. The conference summarized experiences in production, work, and study, and decided that in 1951, in addition to the existing twelve liberation farms and veteran farms, eight new farms would be established, with a planting area of more than 600,000 mu, and more than 450,000 mu of wasteland would be reclaimed. The goal is to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in 1952 and move towards the direction of a model village. The conference commended and rewarded seven special-class labor models such as Pan Mingyou and first-class labor models such as Zhu Dianxiang. The veteran labor models unanimously stated that they would never allow the American imperialists to invade the victory they had won with blood in the past, and they would resolutely resist America and aid Korea with practical and exemplary actions in various jobs.

    The convening of this conference was warmly congratulated and cared for by organs, organizations, and people at all levels inside and outside the pass. Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a congratulatory message, and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the State Council of the Central People's Government, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent congratulatory telegrams. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and others also personally attended the conference and spoke.

            Twelve Farms Established in the Past Year Using Tractors and Other Advanced Machinery

    In the past year, veterans and demobilized soldiers in Northeast China have made great achievements in participating in production and construction. In agriculture, twelve farms have been established, cultivating more than 200,000 mu of wasteland, producing nearly 120,000 tons of grain. In industry, 23 small-scale factories and enterprises have been established, completing nearly 100 billion (Northeast currency) in production tasks. It has played a certain role in solving farm implements and accumulating agricultural funds. There are about 2,000 existing and newly built houses on veteran farms, including some Soviet collective farm A and C-type houses, and more than 40 "Laha" wall-style thatched houses. The twelve farms have nearly 4,000 cattle and horses for plowing, and 1,300 carts and trucks. In terms of farm management methods and cultivation techniques: new farm implements were manufactured and used, tractors and other advanced agricultural machinery were boldly used, new technologies were learned, and seed selection, fertilization, deep plowing and careful cultivation were also promoted. Pig farms and dairy farms were also set up on the farms, and animal husbandry was developed. The cultural level of most veterans has been raised to above the higher primary school level. They have learned new agricultural production knowledge and have initially learned to master and manage semi-mechanized farms. Many comrades have learned to use tractor technology, learned to manage factories and run enterprises, and have become glorious members of the working class. Veterans working in heavy industry departments are working selflessly with unparalleled enthusiasm and creativity. In addition, the regular and vocational education in various veteran vocational schools and colleges has achieved remarkable results in the past year, training a large number of cadres and preserving strength. More than 90% of veterans in rural areas have been allocated land and houses, basically solving the problems of production and life. Many of them have become activists in rural areas, participating in government work and becoming model cadres and people's representatives.

            Many Models Emerge Among Veterans, Promoting Various Construction Undertakings

    Many heroic and model figures have emerged among the veterans in Northeast China: such as Pan Mingyou from Heilongjiang Province, who was a combat hero in the past. After being wounded in the left arm, he returned home to produce. Not only did he not want代耕, but he also led the mutual aid group, using new farm implements, improving farming methods, and increasing yields, thus improving the lives of all members of the group and driving local veterans to actively produce. At the same time, he told stories to the vast masses of peasants, making the broad masses of peasants realize that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. And trained militiamen to consolidate local public security. Due to his diligence and bravery, he gloriously won eight medals and a Northeast Liberation Medal. His lover, under his active influence, also became a labor model. Like Jin Tai from Jilin Province, after being gloriously wounded, he is now a model militiaman. He is the village armed committee member, actively organizing the militia, training the militia, protecting the seedlings and protecting the fields, preventing landlords and rich peasants from翻把, and establishing a model self-defense team (now renamed the militia team). Like Wang Zhiliang from a certain coal mine, he is now an industrial production model. He improved the efficiency of electric pick loading, saved fuel, created new records, and built a model team. Like Li Chuanren, he is now a labor model on the Fuerji River Veteran Farm in Songjiang Province. He has improved efficiency in sowing and harvesting, learned and promoted the use of new farm implements, and won the honorary title of "Flying Knife Hand". In addition, all the representatives who attended the meeting and many veteran comrades who did not attend the meeting have created glorious achievements and promoted the advancement of our country's various construction undertakings.

    All the veteran labor model representatives wrote to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination: "Once the motherland needs us, we will resolutely and decisively rush to the battlefield to kill the enemy and make meritorious service again... At present, we will work even harder, step up production, reclaim more land, harvest more grain, strive to study politics and culture, organize and train the militia, and organize the masses to voluntarily carry stretchers, so as to support the great struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country with our practical actions. Resolutely implement the instructions of being both a combat army and a production army, and a strong assistant to the government."

            一年来建立十二个农场使用拖拉机等先进机器
    一年来东北荣誉军人、复员军人在参加生产建设中，创造了伟大的成绩。在农业方面，建立了十二个农场，开荒播种二十余万亩，生产了近十二万吨粮食；在工业方面，建立了二十三个小规模的工厂企业，完成近千亿（东北币）的生产任务。在解决农场用具及积累农业资金上，起了一定的作用。荣军农场原有并新建房屋二千间左右，其中建筑了一部分苏联集体农庄甲、丙型房舍，并建筑了四十余间“拉哈”墙式的草房。十二处农场共有耕牛、耕马近四千匹，大车、汽车一千三百台。在农场的经营方式和耕作技术方面：制造使用了新式农具和大胆使用了拖拉机及其他先进的农业机器，学会了新技术，同时还提倡了选种施肥，深耕细作。在各农场还设置了养猪场、乳牛场，发展了牧养业。大部分荣军的文化水平提高到高小程度以上，学习了新的农业生产知识，初步学会了掌握和管理着半机械化的农场。许多同志学会了使用拖拉机技术，学会管理工厂和经营企业，成为光荣的工人阶级的成员，在重工业部门工作的荣军，更以无比的积极性和创造性，在忘我地工作。此外在各荣军职校、院的正规、职业教育，一年来成绩显著，培养了大批干部，保存了力量。在乡荣军百分之九十以上的人都分得了土地、房屋，基本上解决了生产和生活问题。其中有许多人成了乡村中的积极分子，参加了政府工作，当了模范干部和人民代表。
            荣军中出现许多模范推动着各种建设事业
    在东北荣军中出现了许多英雄模范人物：如像黑龙江省潘铭有，过去是战斗英雄，左臂负伤后回家生产，不仅不要代耕，而且领导互助组，使用新农具，改进农作法，提高产量，因而改善了全体组员的生活，带动当地的荣军，积极生产，同时给农民讲故事，使广大农民群众认识美帝是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。并训练民兵，巩固地方治安。由于他的勤劳和勇敢，光荣地获得了八枚奖章、一个东北解放纪念章。他的爱人在他积极影响之下，也成为劳动模范。如像吉林省的金泰，在光荣负伤后现在是民兵模范，他是村武装委员，积极组织民兵，训练民兵，护青护场，防止地主富农翻把，建立了模范自卫队（现改称民兵队）。如像某煤矿的王志良，现在是工业生产模范，他提高了电镐装车效率，节省了用油，创造了新纪录，建设了模范组。如像李传仁，现在是松江省伏尔基河荣军农场的劳动模范，播种收割，都提高了效率，学会与推广使用新农具，获得了“飞刀手”的光荣称号。此外，到会的所有代表以及许许多多没有到会的荣军同志，都创造了光荣的业迹，推动着我们国家的各种建设事业向前迈进。
    全体荣军劳模代表上书毛主席表示决心说：“一旦祖国需要我们的时候，我们将坚决果敢的奔赴战场，再次杀敌立功。……在当前我们更加倍的努力工作，加紧生产，多开荒、多打粮，努力学习政治、文化，组织和训练民兵，组织群众志愿出担架，以我们的实际行动，来支援抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大斗争。坚决执行又是战斗大军，又是生产大军，和当政府有力助手的指示。”
