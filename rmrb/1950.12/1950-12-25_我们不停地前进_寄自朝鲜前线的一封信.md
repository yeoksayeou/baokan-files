    We Advance Ceaselessly
    A Letter from the Korean Front
    ××:

    I am writing this letter to you from a dugout. We crossed the Qingchuan River last night (December 1st) and arrived here this morning. It is now afternoon, and I have curled up and slept for more than five hours. Although I am still short on sleep, I don't want to sleep anymore. Outside the dugout is a small plain, crisscrossed with paths, scattered with village houses, and tall autumn trees piercing the sky. Although the plain is small, only four or five li in radius, it already feels expansive to us, who are constantly drilling through narrow mountain gullies. On the plain, there are obvious tank and car tracks like woven cloth; black, scattered empty cans and square foxholes (this is an American creation; such fortifications are like graves for burying corpses, and using them for combat is simply ridiculous). On this small plain, there is not a single person, not a single animal, not a wisp of smoke (except for the tall columns of smoke from the enemy planes bombing in the distance); the earth lies there as if dead. But once night falls, the fighting people will become active.

    The Qingchuan River is what the enemy repeatedly boasted they would hold; the so-called "MacArthur" line is nowhere to be seen. If it exists at all, it is a line of retreat made up of abandoned love letters, empty cans, destroyed tanks and cars, discarded artillery shells, and countless corpses. The clear river water reflects the moonlight, flowing gently over the clearly visible cobblestone riverbed. The river is about half a li wide, and the day before yesterday, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army crossed the river to pursue the enemy (another unit chased them across the ice). When we sped across this river, we saw nothing but the gurgling water and the insulted and damaged Korean land!

    For the past few days, we have been advancing in great strides, once again passing through the ruins of Yunshan, crossing the Jiulong River, the Qingchuan River, and the railway along the Qingchuan River, advancing along the road where the enemy fled! We tread on this wounded land, passing through villages that are burning fiercely or smoldering with lingering smoke, crossing roads cratered by enemy planes, and fields plowed into deep trenches by tanks. We saw peaceful residents lying dead by the roadside, carrying luggage, killed by enemy planes (they were probably moving to a safe area), and we saw the thatched huts of farmers with their boxes forced open by the enemy, the contents scattered in a mess. In one house, a farmer had just made brand-new chests and cabinets, perhaps for a young couple's new home. The young couple must have been planning a warm and happy future in this warm new house. They might have been thinking: "The future children will no longer have to endure the painful days we suffered! Korea will soon move towards a new era!" But what about now? American imperialism shattered their beautiful hopes. The owners of the house are gone, and a pink silk jacket for the wedding is thrown in the garbage under the eaves, together with half-eaten empty cans and bullets and shells. In a remote mountain gully, a farmer told us how the Americans raped the women in the village, and in another mountain village (Taechon West), the American-Rhee bandits killed twelve farmers, including teenagers and old people in their sixties and seventies. What we have seen and heard has increased the soldiers' anger, and we are advancing in great strides, encircling, outflanking, and annihilating the enemy.

    The main culprits responsible for the evil consequences of the war of aggression are those imperialist warmongers. Many of the soldiers who were sent across the ocean to this land just vaguely thought they were going on a "trip" or "earning some living expenses to support their families." A few days ago, some American prisoners of war, more than a hundred of them, were sent from a certain unit. This group of prisoners was won over by shouting. The facts are as follows:

    The U.S. military advanced northward again and came into contact with a unit of our People's Volunteer Army in Chaishan Cave, south of Yunshan. Under the fierce attack of our People's Volunteer Army, a U.S. company commander was wounded and captured. We bandaged him and took good care of him. He then asked another captured U.S. soldier to go back and call over one hundred and fifteen people.

    More than one-third of the surrendered American soldiers are Black, and the soldiers call them "Black Americans." That morning, Section Chief Wang and I went to see them. They were all sitting in a small room, and an English translator was registering them. The prisoners did not look alarmed at all; some were eating popcorn, and some were closing their eyes to rest. As soon as we pushed the door open, one prisoner reached out for a match, and another wanted a cigarette. After one person got a cigarette, everyone actively reached out, and as a result, Section Chief Wang's pack of "Great Production" cigarettes was quickly distributed.

    According to these prisoners, they did not know why they were fighting; "Mac" told them to come. Most of the soldiers were there to make money, because it was difficult to make a living in other occupations in the United States. A U.S. soldier's family letter read: "The seventy dollars you sent has been received. I have used it to repay the debts of my sister and us, and Beibei (child) has also bought new clothes..." These demands encouraged the soldiers to endure the cold and all the hardships of living in a foreign country. But once their lives are threatened, as long as there is a way out, they will quit. One soldier talked about his surrender: "Your artillery fire was very fierce, so we had to crawl on the ground, trying to find a way to break through. However, no matter where we crawled, there were your troops waiting for us. We were extremely frightened when we saw the wounded soldiers in our company moaning loudly. Later, everyone thought of the brothers of the 1st Cavalry Division who you released the last time we met. He introduced your treatment of prisoners of war, so everyone had a glimmer of hope, so we came over as soon as you called us." When talking about their current feelings, he said: "Now I feel calm, our lives are not threatened, and we can sleep well." They said in confusion: "The planes in the sky are ours, the tanks and artillery on the ground are ours, but we are still prisoners of war!" Of course, muddle-headed American soldiers do not understand this principle.

    The soldiers are advancing with full confidence! Now the planes are flying in the sky, flying, strafing, and bombing all day long without interruption. But once night falls, we advance again, and another batch of muddle-headed American soldiers will be killed in the foreign mountains and fields or fortunately become prisoners of war. This is the reason why MacArthur shouted that "faced with such an offensive, I have no way."

    The weather in Korea is already cold, and the ice on some rivers is already passable. The day before yesterday morning, I washed my hair, but when I combed it, a pile of ice powder was left on the comb. Winter is coming, and winter will add some difficulties for us, but the difficulties the enemy faces in winter will be far greater than ours.
                December 2, somewhere in Korea

### 我们不停地前进  寄自朝鲜前线的一封信

    我们不停地前进
    寄自朝鲜前线的一封信
    ××：
    我现在蹲在防空洞里给您写这封信。我们是昨天晚上（十二月一日）过的清川江，今早到的此地。现在是下午了，我已蜷曲着睡了五个多钟头。虽然睡眠仍然不足，但也不想再睡了。洞外是一片小小的平原，阡陌纵横，村屋疏落，秋树挺然高插天宇。虽然平原很小，只有四五里方圆，对于常在狭窄的山沟里钻来钻去的我们，已经算是畅阔的了。平原上，到处是明显的布纹似的坦克和汽车的车辙；黑色的，星星点点的罐头空筒和方形的散兵坑（这是美国人的创造，这样的工事就像埋死尸的墓穴一样，用来作战，简直是开玩笑）。在这小平原上，看不到一个人影，一个动物，一缕烟火（除了远处被敌机炸得燃烧的高高烟柱而外），大地死了一样地躺在那里。但是一到晚上，战斗的人们就会活跃起来的。
    清川江是敌人屡屡吹嘘要用以固守的；所谓“麦克阿瑟”防线，根本不见踪影。假若有的话，那就是用被遗弃的情书、空罐头筒、被打坏的坦克、汽车，被丢下的炮弹和无数死尸所联成的逃跑的线了。清澈的江水，映着月光，在清晰可见的圆石河床上潺潺地流着。江面宽约半里，前天，我国人民志愿军的一个部队就是涉过江水去追击敌人的（另一个部队从冰上追过去）。当我们驰过这条江时，什么也未见到，只有潺潺的流水和被侮辱与损害了的朝鲜土地而已！
    几天来，我们大踏步地前进着，再一次走过云山废墟，跨过九龙江、清川江及沿清川江的铁道，顺着那条敌人奔跑的路前进着！我们踏着这受了伤的土地，穿过正在熊熊烈火中燃烧或冒着余烟的村庄废墟，跨过被敌机炸成深坑的道路，被坦克压成深沟的田野。看到了倒在路旁背着行李的被敌机打死的和平居民（他们大概是向一个安全地带转移的），看到被敌人扭断箱子上的铁锁把东西翻得乱七八糟的农民的茅屋。在一间屋子里，翻了身的农民刚刚制办了崭新的箱柜，这或者是一个年轻人的新房。年轻的夫妇一定在这温暖的新房里，计划着一个如何温暖的幸福的将来。他们或者想着：“未来的孩子再不会过他们受到的痛苦的日月了！朝鲜将如何很快地走向一个新的时代！”但是，现在呢？美国帝国主义粉碎了他们美丽的希望，房屋的主人不在了，结婚用的粉红色丝袄被抛在屋檐下的垃圾里，和吃得狼藉的空罐头筒、子弹、炮弹放在一起。在一条偏僻的山沟里，一个农民向我们诉说美国人如何强奸了庄子上的妇女，而另一个山村上（泰川西），美李匪军杀死了十二个农民，其中有十几岁的孩子和六、七十岁的老人。所见所闻，给战士们增加了愤怒，我们大步地前进着，迂回包围歼灭着敌人。
    侵略战争留下的恶果，主要负责者是那些帝国主义的战争贩子们。那些远渡重洋被送到这块土地上的兵士们，其中不少的人只是稀里糊涂地想“旅旅行”“赚点生活费养养家口”的。前几天，某部队里送来了一些美俘，有一百多个。这批俘虏就是喊话争取过来的。事实经过是这样：
    美军又向北进犯，在云山以南的柴山洞与我人民志愿军某部接触。在我人民志愿军猛击下，美军一个连长受伤被俘。我们替他包扎了，并很好地照看，他就叫另一个被俘的美士兵回去，叫来了一百一十五人。
    投降的美军有三分之一以上是黑人，战士管他们叫“黑美”。那天早上我和王科长去看他们，他们都坐在一间小屋子里，一个英文翻译正在登记。那些俘虏没有一点惊惶之色，有的在吃苞米花，有的在闭着眼养神。我们一推门，就有一个俘虏伸着手要火柴，另一个要香烟，一个人得到香烟以后，大家都活跃地伸出手来，结果王科长的一包“大生产”很快就散光了。
    据这些俘虏谈，他们是不知道为什么要打仗的，是“麦克”叫他们来的。大多数士兵是为了赚钱，因为以其他职业谋生，在美国比较困难。一个美军的家信上写着：“你寄来的七十块钱收到了，我已经用它还了妹妹和我们的债，贝贝（小孩）也买了新衣服……”这些要求鼓舞着士兵们忍受着异国的寒冷和一切艰苦生活。但一当生命受到威胁时，只要有一条生路可走，他们就不干了。一个士兵谈他投降经过说：“你们炮火很猛，我们只好贴着地爬着，想找一个方向突围。但是，不管爬到那里，都有你们的部队等待着，我们看到本连里大声呻吟的伤兵，恐惧到了极点。后来大家都想到前次遇到的你们放回去的骑一师弟兄，他介绍了你仍对待俘虏情形，就都生了一线希望，所以你们一叫我们就过来了。”当谈到他们现在的感想时，他说：“现在心里安静了，我们的生命不受威胁了，我们可以好好地睡觉了。”他们惶惑地说：“天上飞机是我们的，地下坦克、大炮是我们的，当俘虏的却还是我们！”当然，糊涂的美国士兵们是不懂得这个道理的。
    战士们信心百倍地前进着！现在飞机在天上飞着，整日的无间断地飞着、扫射着、轰炸着。但一当夜幕下降时，我们又前进了，又要有一批批稀里糊涂的美国士兵被打死在异国山野里或幸运地当了俘虏。这就是麦克阿瑟叫唤“面临着这样的攻势，我已没有办法”的原因。
    朝鲜的天气已经冷了，有的河上的冰已能走人。前天早上我洗了头，但当梳的时候，梳子上却留下一堆冰粉。冬天来了，冬天会给我们增加一些困难，但敌人在冬天面前的困难，将要比我们多得多。
                十二月二日于朝鲜某地
