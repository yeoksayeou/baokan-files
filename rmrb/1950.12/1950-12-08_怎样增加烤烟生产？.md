How to Increase Flue-Cured Tobacco Production?

    I. The Importance of Flue-Cured Tobacco Production

    The cigarette industry is one of China's important light industries, distributed in more than thirty large and medium-sized cities (more than half of the equipment is concentrated in Shanghai). The number of employees directly engaged in production is around 100,000, and the number of people indirectly dependent on the cigarette industry for their livelihoods is even larger. If there is insufficient raw material for cigarette production, it will affect the cigarette industry and the lives of workers in these large and medium-sized cities. At the same time, for farmers, as long as there is a normal and reasonable price guarantee for tobacco cultivation, although the investment is greater than planting food crops, the harvest is richer and the profit is also greater. Moreover, the semi-labor force of rural women and children can be fully utilized. Especially at a time when rural purchasing power is relatively low, planting tobacco can help improve farmers' living and production conditions.

    Flue-cured tobacco production is also of great importance to national tax revenue and international trade relations. According to regulations, the tax rate for cigarette excise tax is 90% to 120%, and its tax amount accounts for a large proportion of the total excise tax. In 1947, tobacco tax accounted for 45% of the total commodity tax in the country, 96% in Henan Province, and 65% in Anhui Province.

    Before liberation, the foreign exchange lost due to the import of American tobacco was about 40 million US dollars. Today, we cannot be satisfied with simply stopping the import of American tobacco. We must work hard to restore the original flue-cured tobacco producing areas and strive to export flue-cured tobacco. China ranks second in the world in tobacco production (the US imperialists rank first). As long as we operate well, in addition to self-sufficiency, we can also export to our fraternal countries in Eastern Europe, which have also been markets for American tobacco sales (the US imperialists produce 900,000 tons of tobacco leaves annually, with exports reaching 200,000 to 300,000 tons annually, ranking third among agricultural exports). Therefore, there is an urgent need for our country to import flue-cured tobacco to them. For the benefit of our country and people, and for the sake of mutual support to our friendly countries, we should not hesitate to greatly strengthen our flue-cured tobacco production and help them get rid of their dependence on American tobacco, and strengthen the economic strength of our democratic camp to combat the US imperialists. In today's world, when the US imperialists are actively instigating wars of aggression, this is of even greater significance.

    II. Reasons for the Decline in Flue-Cured Tobacco Production

    National flue-cured tobacco production in previous years has often been insufficient for self-sufficiency. Only in 1948, more than 2.7 million mu were planted, with an output of more than 360 million jin, sufficient to meet domestic needs with a slight surplus. In 1949, it suddenly dropped to 1 million mu, with a tobacco output of 100 million jin. In 1950, national flue-cured tobacco production only completed 54% of the plan. The decline in flue-cured tobacco production in recent years has seriously affected the supply of raw materials for the current cigarette industry. In order to support the normal production of China's cigarette industry, guarantee the livelihoods of 100,000 workers, and safeguard the interests of the vast number of tobacco farmers, we must recognize the reasons for the decline in flue-cured tobacco production in order to find ways to improve.

    First of all, we must recognize that the aggression of American and British imperialism and the traitorous policies of the Kuomintang reactionary government are the most serious factors that have hit and hindered our country's flue-cured tobacco production. For more than 40 years, American and British imperialism not only controlled 60% of China's cigarette industry, but also monopolized all cigarette raw materials. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, domestic flue-cured tobacco production was entirely handled by American and British imperialist tobacco trusts. For example, the British-American Tobacco Company, the British-American Tobacco Transportation Company, and the Wing Tai & Co., Ltd., whose branches were all over the country, with more than 550 branches above the county level. The amount of flue-cured tobacco imported into our country averaged about 700,000 dan per year before the war, with the highest being 1.5 million dan in 1931. After the war, the import volume in 1947 was 370,626 piculs. In 1948, flue-cured tobacco production should have been at a normal level of production and sales balance, but due to American imperialist economic aggression and the rush of bureaucratic capital and speculative manufacturers for imported goods, more than 190,000 dan were imported that year. The "American Aid" bill, which was full of bloody content, listed the import of American tobacco into our country, amounting to 760,000 piculs in one year. As a result, the price of domestic flue-cured tobacco fell sharply, and farmers suffered a disaster of bumper harvests and deeply felt the loss of planting tobacco. The cultivated area in 1949 was sharply reduced to more than 900,000 mu; and there has been no turnaround in 1950.

    Secondly, after liberation, due to the long-term exploitation by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries and more than ten years of war damage, our financial situation is very difficult, production has declined, and people's lives are very hard, and purchasing power is still very low. In addition, the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs blocked our seaports, and in February of this year, they carried out crazy bombings of Shanghai and other places. Therefore, in the process of transformation and reconstruction of our entire economy, the industrial and commercial circles, which themselves had many shortcomings, experienced difficulties of all sizes, and cigarette manufacturers were no exception. Most cigarette factories are unable or unwilling to store raw materials (under normal circumstances, there should be one year or several months of inventory), and most of them buy and sell at any time, and many factories even stop work. As a result, tobacco leaves are even more unsalable. In addition, transportation has not fully recovered. Many tobacco merchants are not only unwilling to purchase, but also sell their stored tobacco, and take the opportunity to buy at lower prices. At that time, our state-owned native produce companies were unable to purchase large quantities, and did not have enough warehouses and re-baking equipment to store large quantities of flue-cured tobacco. Therefore, the cigarette and tobacco leaf market formed a temporary illusion of oversupply. Tobacco farmers have been hit by excessively low tobacco prices for many years, and this spring they have been severely affected. Therefore, despite the government's call and deployment to plant tobacco, they generally expressed a cold attitude. Moreover, flue-cured tobacco cultivation requires a large investment, and in the past it was mostly planted by landlords and rich peasants. After the land reform, farmers mostly planted the vast majority of land with food, cotton and other crops. Unless the sales and reasonable prices of flue-cured tobacco can be guaranteed, farmers are unwilling to plant tobacco.

    Third, in addition to the above two reasons, the shortcomings in our work are also a reason for the reduction in flue-cured tobacco this year. Because, limited by manpower and time, we did not understand the production and sales of flue-cured tobacco in sufficient detail, and overestimated the amount of tobacco stored by the masses. When flue-cured tobacco was unsalable this spring, we did not dare to resolutely launch and organize farmers to plant large quantities. But more importantly, when tobacco prices fell (tobacco prices once fell to an unprecedented low of six grades of Xuchang flue-cured tobacco for less than one jin of wheat), we did not promptly help farmers with national economic strength, and did not raise purchase prices to a reasonable level, and did not clearly and positively propose a guarantee of reasonable prices to farmers, which greatly affected farmers' enthusiasm for planting tobacco. Although the error was discovered later and it was decided to issue fertilizer loans and coal loans, the fertilizer loans missed the opportunity due to repeated consultations among various work departments. At the end of July, the Ministry of Trade instructed the Coal Construction Company to lend fuel coal to tobacco farmers for flue-curing. However, because the organization was not good, not only were the types and quantities of coal unsuitable for the needs of farmers, but also delayed the flue-curing period, and failed to achieve the effect of support.

    III. A Few Suggestions for Increasing Tobacco Production

    Our country is a country in the world that is suitable for flue-cured tobacco cultivation. According to the development of agricultural production in our country, the needs of the cigarette industry, and the requirements of various friendly countries, we should and can plant 2 million mu of flue-cured tobacco and produce 2.8 million dan of flue-cured tobacco leaves next year. If this task can be successfully completed, in addition to meeting the needs of the domestic cigarette industry, there can also be 200,000 to 500,000 dan of flue-cured tobacco for export, which is worth 10 million to 25 million US dollars. The focus of increasing flue-cured tobacco production in 1951 should be on the restoration of old basic areas, such as Henan, Shandong, and northern Anhui provinces. In the future, according to domestic and international needs, new areas suitable for cultivation will be selected and expanded. In the northeast: Liaodong and Jilin regions are very suitable for planting. If 28,000 hectares can be reached in 1952, it will be sufficient to meet the needs of the northeast without having to rely on Guannei. At the same time, the northeast is also the most favorable for foreign exports. In North China, Shanxi - southern and central Shanxi regions, and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in the southwest, flue-cured tobacco production has a considerable foundation and should be appropriately developed. The recent high tobacco prices are extremely favorable conditions for stimulating increased production next year, and we should plan and deploy as soon as possible; and help and organize the masses to prepare for tobacco planting, and seize the opportunity to overcome the idea of ​​being afraid to cultivate tobacco due to the falling tobacco prices over the years; at the same time, we must also pay attention to preventing blind competition due to high price stimuli.

    In order to win the victory in completing the above tasks, the following tasks must be strengthened:

    First, experience has shown that the most important task is to guarantee sales and ensure reasonable prices. This major policy that dominates the production of various agricultural cash crops has provided considerable successful experience in increasing cotton production. As long as our subjective strength permits, it should also be applied to the work of increasing flue-cured tobacco production. Regarding the issue of guaranteeing reasonable price standards, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has sent people to cooperate with local governments to conduct production cost surveys in several major flue-cured tobacco producing areas, and the East China region has also conducted this survey work and has done a good job. It is hoped that various districts and provinces can also strengthen this work, so as to provide farmers with necessary guarantees as soon as possible to encourage farmers to increase planting of flue-cured tobacco.

    According to the needs of the cigarette industry and foreign sales, a yield of 2.8 million dan of flue-cured tobacco is not much, and sales should not be a problem. The key is how to purchase in an organized and planned manner and make good use of the seasonal regulatory role. In this regard, the Northeast People's Government and the cooperatives have provided us with excellent examples in the purchase of flue-cured tobacco in 1950: The Liaodong and Jilin Provincial People's Governments, the Northeast Monopoly Bureau, the Northeast Tobacco and Alcohol Corporation, the Northeast Bank, the Northeast Cooperative Federation and other units, together with representatives of tobacco farmers in the tobacco area and representatives of county cooperatives, held a meeting to formulate unified flue-cured tobacco grading standards and reasonable prices (five grades of flue-cured tobacco per jin are equivalent to eight jin of corn. If each mu harvests 120 jin of flue-cured tobacco, it is equivalent to 960 jin of corn). The cooperatives at all levels purchase from farmers, the tobacco and alcohol corporation contracts to collect from the cooperatives, and the grain management bureau also uses this reasonable ratio to pay public grain with tobacco leaves, which not only guarantees sales, but also guarantees prices, and farmers are very enthusiastic about production. At the end of October, the Economic Planning Commission of the Northeast People's Government convened a meeting of relevant departments and decided that each relevant department should sign a contract to further guarantee sales and guarantee prices. These experiences are worth greatly promoting.

    According to the current national situation, private cigarette industry and tobacco merchants account for a considerable proportion. It is hoped that they can highly promote the spirit of patriotism and, for the common prosperity of our people's national economy, can closely combine with state-owned trading enterprises and cooperatives, jointly abide by reasonable prices, and carry out the purchase and storage of raw materials in a planned and organized manner, so as to maintain the normal development of our people's economy.

    Second, strengthen the organizational work on agricultural production. Major tobacco producing areas have implemented land reform, or are in the process of land reform. According to the decentralization of tobacco planting area and tobacco planting households brought about by land decentralization after land reform, it is very important to organize to expand the flue-cured tobacco planting area. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the development of rural supply and marketing cooperatives in tobacco producing areas. The widespread development of cooperatives can not only strengthen the work of organized and planned procurement and guarantee reasonable prices, but also provide farmers with support such as loans, fertilizers, and flue-cured tobacco fuel through cooperatives. Secondly, due to the reduction of tobacco production in recent years, many tobacco barns have been destroyed and converted into dwellings. Organizing small tobacco planting mutual aid groups is very important for restoring and building tobacco barns. An ordinary middle peasant cannot afford to invest in building a tobacco barn alone. Organizing everyone to contribute labor to build it, the cost is small and the construction is fast. And organizing reasonable division of labor can equip experienced people to take charge of tobacco, which can improve technology, save manpower and material resources, and reduce the cost of flue-cured tobacco. Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province in Northeast China has achieved significant achievements in this work.

    Third, strengthen technical guidance on agricultural production: (1) Replace with improved varieties - which can not only increase production, but also improve quality. This work should focus on existing improved varieties such as: No. 401, No. 402, Foguang, Da Jinyuan, etc., and should be popularized in a planned manner within three to five years; and pay attention to continuing to select and breed improved varieties suitable for each tobacco area. (2) Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests - Henan tobacco area has been seriously affected by diseases this year. Disease-resistant breeding must be strengthened, and the prevention and elimination of insect pests must also be given great attention. In addition to leading the masses to use various local medicines for prevention and control, the supply of medicines and machinery should be fully provided as much as possible. (3) Strengthen technical guidance on flue-cured tobacco - Flue-cured tobacco is the most important link in the production process. Tobacco research and promotion institutions should go deep into the tobacco areas to introduce and assist in flue-cured tobacco technology, and organize the masses to learn from experienced flue-cured tobacco farmers. (4) In terms of cultivation methods - such as: timely sowing and harvesting, appropriate row and plant spacing, seed selection and disinfection, seedling raising methods, soil fertilizer selection, etc., should be paid attention to.

    Fourth, the state must provide farmers with possible support: The most important thing is to strengthen agricultural loan work in tobacco planting areas. Due to the destruction of the enemy and puppets for many years and the low tobacco prices, tobacco farmers have suffered great losses and have limited investment capacity. In order to guarantee the yield of 2.8 million dan of flue-cured tobacco, it is very necessary to provide loans for fertilizers, fuels, and the construction of tobacco barns.

    Fifth, increase re-baking equipment: In order to avoid mildew damage of tobacco leaves, improve cigarette quality, make tobacco leaves durable and resistant to storage, reduce cigarette costs, and facilitate export, sufficient re-baking plants should be established in major tobacco areas; Henan, northern Anhui, Guizhou and other places are particularly in need. In these important tobacco areas, the huge losses of people's property caused by the lack of re-baking equipment every year are very alarming. It not only affects the supply and price changes of cigarette raw materials, but also reduces the quality of finished products and affects the health of smokers. This is what we should pay extreme attention to and find ways to correct as soon as possible; especially recently, tobacco leaves have export outlets. Without proper re-baking, it is very easy to mold during long-distance transportation, which not only affects foreign sales, but also affects the reputation of the country.

    怎样增加烤烟生产？
    一、烤烟生产的重要性
    卷烟工业为我国重要轻工业之一，分布在三十多个大中城市（一半以上的设备集中在上海）；直接从事生产的职工人数在十万人左右，加上间接依赖卷烟工业生活的人，为数甚伙。如果卷烟生产原料不足，将影响到这些大中城市的卷烟工业与职工生活。同时在农民方面，栽培烟草只要有正常合理的价格保证，投资虽较种植粮食作物为大，但因收获较丰，获利亦多；而且农家妇女儿童等半劳动力都可得到充分的利用。尤其在目前农村购买力较低的情况下，植烟可以帮助改善农民的生活和生产条件的。
    烤烟生产对于国家的税收和国际贸易关系亦极重大。按规定卷烟货物税纳税率为百分之九十至一百二十，其税额，在整个货物税款中占有很大的比重。一九四七年全国烟类税收占全部货物税的百分之四十五，河南省则占全省货物税的百分之九十六，安徽省占百分之六十五。
    解放前由于美烟进口，所损耗的外汇约在美金四千万元左右。今日我们不能仅以停止美烟进口为满足，必须努力将原有烤烟产区好好恢复起来，争取烤烟出口。我国产烟数量居世界的第二位（美帝占第一位），只要好好经营，除自给外，还可向我们东欧新民主主义国家的兄弟之邦输出，这些国家亦素为美烟销售的市场（美帝年产烟叶九○万吨，外销每年达二○——三○万吨，占农产品输出品的第三位）。故迫切要求我国向他们输入烤烟。为我们国家人民的利益计，为我们对友邦相互支援的道义计，我们应该毫不犹豫的大量加强我们的烤烟生产，帮助他们摆脱美烟的依赖，加强我们民主阵营的经济力量，以打击美帝，这在美帝积极挑动侵略战争的今天，是更有其重大意义的。
    二、烤烟减产的原因
    全国历年烤烟生产，多不足自给，仅一九四八年曾栽种二百七十多万亩，产量三亿六千多万斤，足敷国内需要而稍有剩余。一九四九年骤减至一百万亩，产烟一亿斤。一九五○年全国烤烟生产仅完成计划百分之五十四。历年烤烟的减产，严重地影响到当前卷烟工业原料的供应。为扶植我国卷烟工业的正常生产，保证十万职工的生活，维护广大植烟农民的利益，我们必须认识烤烟减产的原因，以求改进的方法。
    首先，我们必须认识，美英帝国主义的侵略及国民党反动政府的卖国政策，是打击与障碍我国烤烟生产最最严重的因素。四十多年来，美英帝国主义不仅掌握了我国卷烟工业百分之六十，而且垄断了全部卷烟原料；尤其在国民党反动统治时期，国内烤烟生产，全由美英帝国主义的烟草托辣斯一手包办。比如颐中烟草公司，颐中烟草运销公司，永泰和公司等，其分支机构遍布全国，县以上的分支机构即达五百五十余处。向我国输入的烤烟，战前每年平均约在七十万担左右，最高为一九三一年曾达一百五十万担。战后一九四七年的输入量为三七○、六二六市担。一九四八年烤烟生产本应是产销平衡的正常水平，但由于美帝经济侵略及官僚资本、投机厂商趋惊舶来品，该年又输入十九万余担，血腥的“美援”法案中所列向我国输入美烟，一年中为数竟达七十六万市担。因此，国产烤烟价格大跌，农民遭到了丰收的灾难，深深感到植烟的吃亏。一九四九年栽培面积便锐减至九○余万亩；一九五○年亦迄未有所转机。
    其次，解放后，由于帝国主义及国民党反动派的长期压榨及十多年的战争破坏，我们财经状况是很困难的，生产减退，人民生活很苦，购买力还很低微；加以美蒋匪帮封锁我海口，今年二月间更对上海等地进行疯狂轰炸，因此，在我们整个经济的转变、改造过程中，本身带有许多缺点的工商界便发生了大大小小的困难，卷烟厂商，自亦不能例外。大部分烟厂都无力或不愿存储原料（按正常状态，应有一年或数个月的存货），多数为随买随卖，甚至有不少烟厂停工；因而，更使烟叶滞销。加之，交通运输尚未完全恢复；许多烟商不仅不肯收购，且还出售存烟，并乘机压价收买。我国营土产公司，当时尚无力大量收购，且无足够的仓库与复烤设备以保存大量烤烟，故卷烟和烟叶市场便形成一时的假象的供过于求现象。烟农连年来已受烟价过低的打击，今春又受此严重影响，故虽经政府号召、布置植烟，一般仍表示冷淡的态度；且烤烟栽培投资较大，过去都为地主富农种植，土改后，农民多以绝大部分土地栽种粮食、棉花等作物，除非能保障烤烟的销路与合理的价格，农民是不愿种烟的。
    其三，除上述两方面的原因，造成烤烟的减产外，我们工作上的缺点，亦是今年烤烟减产的一个原因。因为，我们限于人力与时间，对烤烟产销情况了解得不够详尽，过高的估计了群众的存烟量；当今春烤烟滞销时，便不敢坚决放手的发动与组织农民大量种植。但更重要的，是当烟价下跌时（烟价曾一度空前低落至一斤六级许昌烤烟换不到一斤小麦），我们没有及时的以国家经济力量帮助农民，没有把收购价格提高到合理的水平，并明确肯定的向农民提出合理价格的保证，这就大大影响了农民种烟情绪。此后，虽经发觉错误，决定发放肥料贷款与燃煤贷款，但由于各工作部门往返磋商，肥贷错过了时机。七月末，由贸易部指令煤建公司贷给烟农烤烟的燃煤，又因为组织得不好，不仅煤类与数量不适合农民的需要，同时一再辗转，也耽误了烤烟期，没有能达到扶植的效果。
    三、对于增产烤烟的几点意见
    我国是世界上宜于烤烟栽培的国家。根据我国农业生产发展的情况，卷烟工业的需要，以及各友邦的要求，明年我们种植烤烟二○○万亩，生产烤烟叶二八○万担，是应该而且可能的。如果这一任务能争取顺利完成，除足供本国卷烟工业需用外，尚可有二○——五○万担烤烟出口，可值美金一千万到二千五百万元。一九五一年增加烤烟生产的重点，应该着重在旧有基础地区的恢复，如：河南、山东、皖北等省。今后根据国内与国际的需要，再选择适宜栽培的新地区加以扩展，在东北方面：辽东、吉林地区很宜于种植，一九五二年如能达到二万八千垧，即可足供东北之需而不必再仰赖关内。同时对外出口也以东北最为有利。华北之山西——晋南晋中地区，及西南的云南、贵州两省，目前烤烟生产已有相当基础，均应力求适当的发展。最近的烟价很高，对刺激明年增产为极有利的条件，应及早计划布置；并帮助与组织群众进行栽烟准备，抓紧克服因历年烟价跌落而产生的害怕栽培烟草的思想；同时也须注意防止因高价刺激而盲目竞栽。
    为争取上述任务的胜利完成，必须加强下列各项工作：
    第一、经验证明最首要的工作是保证销路与保证合理价格。这一支配着各种农业经济作物生产的重大政策，在棉花增产上，已提供了相当成功的经验，只要我们主观力量许可，亦应该把他引用到烤烟的增产工作上去。关于保证合理价格的标准问题，中央农业部曾派人协同地方政府，在几个主要烤烟产区做了生产成本调查，华东区也进行了这个调查工作，并且做得很好，希望各区省也能加强这一工作，以便尽早的向农民提出必要的保证，以鼓励农民增植烤烟。
    根据卷烟工业及外销的需要状况，二八○万担烤烟的产量并不算多，销路应该是没有问题的，关键在如何有组织有计划的收购，并很好的掌握季节性的调节作用。在这一方面，东北区人民政府以及合作社在一九五○年烤烟收购上，已经给我们提供了优良的范例：辽东、吉林两省人民政府，东北专卖总局、东北烟酒总公司、东北银行、东北合作总社等单位，与烟区农民代表、县合作社代表等，开会拟定了统一的烤烟分级标准及合理价格（每斤五级烤烟合八斤苞米，每亩收烤烟一二○斤计，合苞米九六○斤），由各级合作社向农民购买，烟酒总公司向合作社包收，粮管局亦依此合理比价，进行了以烟叶代缴公粮，既保证了销路，又保证了价格，农民生产情绪很高。十月末东北人民政府经济计划委员会又召集有关部门开会，并决定各有关部门订立联系合同，以进一步保证销路，保证价格。这些经验是值得大大发扬的。
    根据目前全国情况，私营卷烟工业与烟业商贩所占的比重是相当大的，希望他们能够高度发扬爱国主义的精神，为共谋我们人民国家经济的繁荣，能和国营贸易企业与合作社密切的结合，共同遵守合理的价格，有计划有组织的进行收买和购存原料，以维护我们人民经济的正常发展。
    第二、加强农业生产上的组织工作。主要产烟区都已实行土地改革，或正在进行土改，根据土改后随着土地分散而来的栽烟面积及栽烟户分散的情况，为扩大烤烟种植面积，组织起来是十分重要的。首先需加强产烟区农村供销合作社的发展。合作社广泛的发展，不仅可以加强有组织有计划的收购，和保证合理价格的工作，并可通过合作社给农民以贷款、贷肥、贷烤烟燃料等扶植。其次由于几年来烟草减产，烤房毁坏和改做住屋者甚多，组织小型的种烟互助组，对恢复与兴建烤房是十分重要的，一个普通中农无力单独投资修建一座烤房，组织起来大家拿出劳动力来修建，则化费小而建成速。且组织起来，合理分工，可以配备有经验的人专管烤烟，在技术上可以提高，在人力物力上都极节约，且能减低烤烟成本。东北的辽东省凤城县在这一工作上已获得重大的成就。
    第三、加强农业生产上的技术指导：（一）更换优良品种——不仅可以增产，更可以提高品质。这项工作应就已有的优良品种如：四○一号、四○二号、佛光、大金元等，应有计划的在三、五年之内做到普及；并注意继续选育适合各个烟区的优良品种。（二）病虫害防治——河南烟区今年病害严重，抗病育种必须加强，虫害的防治与捕灭亦须大力注意。除领导群众用各种土产药剂进行防治外。应尽可能的充分供给药械。（三）加强烤烟技术指导——烤烟是生产过程中最重要的一个环节，烟草试验研究推广机构应该深入烟区，作烤烟技术的介绍与帮助，并组织群众向有经验的烤烟农民学习。（四）在栽培方法上——诸如：适时的播种与收获，适当的行株距离，种子选择与消毒，育苗方法，土壤肥料的选择等都应注意。
    第四、国家必需给予农民以可能的支持：最主要的是加强栽烟区的农贷工作，由于多年来敌伪的摧残，烟草价格的低落，种烟农民损失甚大，投资能力有限；为保证二八○万担烤烟的产量，对于区进行肥料，燃料，与修建烤房等贷款，是十分必要的。
    第五、增加复烤设备：为了避免烟叶的霉损，提高卷烟品质，使烟叶经久耐藏，降低卷烟成本，并便于出口起见，在主要烟区应设立足够的复烤厂；其中以河南、皖北、贵州等地尤感需要。这几个重要烟区，因为没有复烤设备的关系，每年所造成人民财产的重大损失十分惊人，它不仅影响了卷烟原料的供应和价格的变动，同时会降低成品的品质，和影响吸者的健康，这是我们应该加以极端重视和及早设法改正的；尤其最近烟叶有外销出路，未经妥善的复烤，在长途运输中，很易霉烂，不仅影响对外销路，更会影响到国家的信誉。
