    Ordinary Yi Village
    Since the implementation of land reform in Dongrong Village, Eighth District, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, the lives of the farmers have been getting better and better after three years of production campaigns. This year's harvest was not very good, and soybeans and millet suffered from frost. The 137 households in the village still harvested more than 1.6 million jin of grain (municipal jin, same below), with an average income of 2,153 jin of grain per person. One laborer harvested 8,934 jin of grain. In addition to this winter's sideline income, after deducting the villagers' food, horse feed, clothing, and public grain, there will be at least 500,000 jin of surplus grain.
  Unbearable Memories of the Past
    Before land reform, the more than 100 households in Dongrong Village cultivated 5,653 mu of land (municipal mu, same below), had 15 head of cattle, 43 horses, and 17 carts, of which 2,980 mu of land, 17 horses, and 3 large carts were in the hands of three landlords. However, the 83 poor and hired peasants had only 1,405 mu of land, 6 head of cattle, 3 horses, and 2 carts. Among them, 34 hired peasant households had no cattle, horses, or carts. The 19 middle peasant households had only 11 head of cattle, 14 horses, 10 carts, and 855 mu of land. At that time, there were years of floods, coupled with the long-term requisition of vehicles, horses, and labor during the enemy and puppet rule, resulting in very low productivity. As a result, many middle peasants, such as Sui Dianguo and Miao Xiucheng, left a lot of land barren and unable to cultivate. Grain yields were also very low, with only about 60 jin of wheat or about 200 jin of sorghum produced per mu. The lives of hired, poor, and middle peasants were very difficult. For example, Liu Chengzhang's family of sixteen had only five worn-out quilts, and Ye Zhenfa's family of twelve had only three old quilts. The poor old man Wu, who was nearly eighty years old, had only a broken fishing net filled with old cotton wadding, which he wore during the day and covered himself with at night. The women in the hired peasant Yuan Wen's family wore tattered single pants that were only half-length in winter, wrapped in a sack. Eating was even more difficult. In 1942, due to the enemy's brutal plundering, many middle peasant families survived on wild vegetables and greens. In ordinary years, many families ate rice with bran and husks. In 1944, the average poor peasant had an income of only 441 jin of grain per person, and one laborer harvested only a little over 1,900 jin of grain.
  Land Reform Changed Poverty
    Since the implementation of land reform in the winter of 1947, this situation has never returned. An average of 7.5 mu of land was distributed to each person. The middle and poor peasants originally had 17 head of cattle and 17 horses, and they also received 14 horses and 2 head of cattle from the landlords and rich peasants; the government also lent 5 head of cattle, and they bought 7 horses with the property obtained from the struggle against the landlords. Under the government's call, everyone cooperated and helped each other. In 1948, they reclaimed 1,650 mu of land that had been barren during the enemy and puppet era. Under the leadership of the government, they built a large drainage ditch, and the land was no longer afraid of flooding even if it was low-lying. By 1949, with the help of government agricultural loans and the peasants' own investment of surplus grain in production, the number of draught animals in the village had increased to 81 horses, 15 head of cattle, and 23 carts. In 1949, another 810 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. By this year, the village's arable land has increased to 8,587 mu, with an average of about 11.5 mu of land per person. Among the 137 households in the village, 90 households raise draught animals, with a total of 110 horses, 30 head of cattle, and 40 large carts; all the low-lying and waterlogged land has been transformed into fertile fields. This year, wheat yielded 165 jin per mu, exceeding the 1944 yield by 149 percent, and sorghum yielded 317 jin per mu, exceeding the 1944 yield by 54 percent. This village produced more than 700,000 jin of grain in 1944. Although the harvest was not good in 1949 due to drought, it had already produced 1.4 million jin of grain. This year, when the autumn harvest was approaching, soybeans and millet suffered from early frost, but still produced more than 1.6 million jin of grain. Due to the general increase in grain in rural areas, a large number of vehicles and horses are needed for transportation. This village's transportation of grain by vehicles and horses alone this winter is estimated to generate an income of more than 160,000 jin of grain. The village also raises 403 pigs and 1,291 chickens. Now, the 20 middle peasant households have 30 horses, 5 head of cattle, and 15 large carts. The 65 poor peasant households also have 27 horses, 16 head of cattle, and 13 carts. The 44 hired peasant households have 18 horses, 8 head of cattle, and 10 carts. Life is getting better and better. On average, each person has added about 30 chi of cloth and 1.5 jin of cotton this year. Everyone has put on cotton clothes that are new inside and out, and many young people have also made uniforms to wear. This year, the whole village has built 62 new houses, and 38 of them have been fitted with glass windows, and the rest will also be fitted. The poor peasant Ye Zhenfa (deputy village chief), whose family has ten members, now has two large horses, one small horse, and one large cart, and cultivates more than 200 mu of land. He now has at least more than 30,000 jin of surplus grain. In addition, he also has six fat pigs, one sow, eight piglets, and more than forty chickens and ducks. This winter, transporting grain by large cart can generate an income of at least 20 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below). The middle peasants Chen Bingxing, Kong Qingju, etc., are in a similar situation to Ye Zhenfa. The landlords Sun Baichang and Zhu Shouyi have also each had three horses, cultivate more than 200 mu of land, and built new houses due to their good labor.
    As life becomes more and more prosperous, the village's enthusiasm for production has also grown stronger. The autumn harvest only ended this year, and 24 carts were sent out to transport grain in early November, generating an income of more than 100 million in half a month. Ye Zhenfa's labor exchange mutual aid group will have a surplus of 68,600 jin of grain next year after deducting all expenses and using 20,000 to 30,000 jin of grain for marrying a daughter-in-law and building a house, which will all be used for expanding reproduction. Many households will also reclaim wasteland next year. The wasteland that was barren in the past has already been planted, and new land will be reclaimed next year. It is estimated that the whole village can reclaim 750 mu. Five or six families who do not have draught animals will all buy draught animals this winter. The hired peasant Chen Hai, whose life is relatively difficult, also married a daughter-in-law this year. He also exchanged his cattle for horses and bought a cart in partnership with others. The hired peasant Li Wansheng bought a new cart himself. They all want to participate in grain transportation. Everyone is asking for improved seeds, and many people are trying to exchange them in other counties. The peasants are planning to buy good weeding machines, foreign plows for reclaiming wasteland, and harrows. They also hope to use Soviet-style harvesters and threshers to harvest wheat next year.
  Indeed an Ordinary Village
    Even so, the production situation in Dongrong Village is only a general village in Jixian County. Due to the weak leadership of the village cadres in the past, production was a step behind other villages in the past two years; production was in a state of laissez-faire, and the mutual aid organizations were also not good. In Jixian County, almost 80 percent of the households in ordinary villages have draught animals, while one-third of the households in this village do not have draught animals. In Lujia Youfang Village, among the 82 households, only 16 households have enough food and clothing and sufficient means of production next year, but those without surplus grain are considered poor households in the whole village, while Dongrong Village still has 13 households whose means of production are not sufficient and whose lives are difficult. The main reason is that the labor exchange mutual aid was not done well in the past. When they could work on their own, they did not participate in mutual aid. Therefore, most of them did not achieve deep plowing and careful cultivation, and households with insufficient labor harvested less grain. It was not until last year that a relatively good Ye Zhenfa labor exchange group was established and played a promoting role. This year, everyone has a lot of enthusiasm, and three or four labor exchange groups are competing with the Ye Zhenfa group, and they have achieved more hoeing and more trips. However, labor efficiency has not been fully utilized, and new agricultural technologies have not yet been adopted. Therefore, the economic development of this village has been a step behind other villages.
  Arise, Defend the Country
    But this village has developed after all, and life has improved, much happier than before. Instead of suffering from cold and hunger, they are eating well, dressing warmly, have their own houses, land, means of production, draught animals, and surplus grain in their warehouses.
    Just as the harvest was underway this year, news came that the US imperialists had occupied our Taiwan and disturbed the border of Liaodong and Jilin. The peasants were very angry when they heard this news, and soon seven peasants volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war. Their families took out surplus grain to prepare clothing, utensils, cotton-padded coats, good fur hats, new Ugg boots, leggings, backpacks, dry food bags, etc. for their children. They bravely participated in the struggle to defend the country. After the public grain task was assigned, the women immediately launched a campaign to select good public grain. Every family selected good grain, and the soybeans were all screened grain by grain. The peasants are assisting the Korean neighbors with full enthusiasm and defending their own happy lives.

    普通一村
    松江省东部集贤县第八区东荣屯从实行土地改革以来，经过三年的生产运动，农民的生活越过越好了。今年年景不大好，大豆、谷子受了霜灾，全屯一百三十七户人家还收获了一百六十多万斤粮食（市斤，下同），平均每口人有两千一百五十三斤粮食的收入。一个劳动力收获了八千九百三十四斤粮食。加上今年冬季副业收入，除去全屯人吃、喂马、穿衣、公粮，至少还有五十万斤余粮。
  不堪回首话当年
    东荣屯，在土地改革以前一百多户人家，耕种着五千六百五十三亩土地（市亩，以下均同），有十五头牛，四十三匹马，十七辆车，其中有二千九百八十亩土地，十七匹马，三辆大车是在三户地主手里。而八十三户贫、雇农却只有一千四百零五亩土地，六头牛，三匹马，两辆车。其中雇农三十四户，牛、马、车一件也没有。十九户中农也只有十一头牛，十四匹马，十辆车，八百五十五亩土地。那时连年水涝，加上在敌伪统治时车、马、劳力被长期征用，生产力很低，以致许多中农，如隋殿国、苗秀成等，都荒芜了好多土地，无力耕种。粮食产量也很低，一亩地才产六十多斤小麦，或高粱二百斤左右。雇、贫、中农的生活非常困苦。像中农刘成章家那时十六口人，只有五床破旧被，贫农叶振发家十二口人，只有三床旧被。而贫农老吴头年近八十，只有一个破渔网里面填些旧棉絮，白天披着，晚上盖它。雇农袁文家的妇女冬天还穿着半截的破单裤，围上一条麻袋。吃的就更困难了。一九四二年因敌人残酷搜刮，好多家中农都是吃野菜、青菜度过来的。平常年月也有许多家吃米连糠带皮吃。一九四四年平均贫农一口人才收入四百四十一斤粮食，一个劳力才收获一千九百多斤粮食。
  土改改变了贫困
    自从一九四七年冬实行土地改革以后，这种情况是一去不返了。平均每人分了七亩五分地，中农、贫农原有十七头牛，十七匹马，由地主、富农手中又分来十四匹马，两头牛；政府又贷给五头牛，用斗争地主分得的财物又买来七匹马。在政府号召下大家合作互助，一九四八年一年就把敌伪时代荒芜了的土地开垦起一千六百五十亩，在政府领导下修了一条大排水壕，地虽洼也不怕涝了。到一九四九年，经政府农贷帮助及农民自己把余粮投入生产，全屯耕畜已增加到八十一匹马，十五头牛，二十三辆车。一九四九年又垦起八百一十亩荒地。到今年，这村耕地已增加到八千五百八十七亩，平均每人约有十一亩半田，全屯一百三十七户中，有九十户饲养耕畜，共有马一百一十匹，牛三十头，大车四十辆；涝洼地已全部变成了良田。今年小麦每亩收获一百六十五斤，超过一九四四年产量的百分之一百四十九，高粮每亩收获三百一十七斤，超过一九四四年产量的百分之五十四。这屯在一九四四年共产粮七十多万斤，一九四九年虽然天旱收成不够好，但已产粮一百四十万斤，今年，在将近秋收时，大豆、谷子又遭了早霜，仍产粮一百六十多万斤。由于农村粮食普遍增加，需要大批车马运输，这屯今冬仅车马运粮估计还可收入十六万余斤粮食。全屯还饲养了四百零三口猪，一千二百九十一只鸡。现在二十户中农已有三十匹马，五头牛，十五辆大车。六十五户贫农也有二十七匹马，十六头牛，十三辆车。四十四户雇农有十八匹马，八头牛，十辆车。生活是越过越好了，平均今年每人添了约三十尺布，一斤半棉花，人人穿上了里面三新的棉衣，年青人还有许多做了制服穿。全屯今年盖了六十二间新房，有三十八间已按上了玻璃窗子，其余也要按。贫农叶振发（副村长），一家十口人，现在有两匹大马，一匹小马，一辆大车，种着二百多亩地，现在至少有三万多斤余粮。此外，还存六口肥猪，一个母猪，八个猪仔，四十多只鸡、鸭。今冬大车运粮至少还可以收入两千万元（东北币，下同）。中农陈秉兴、孔庆举等，都和叶振发情况差不多。地主孙柏昌，朱守义由于劳动好也已每家有了三匹马，各种二百多亩田，盖了新房子。
    由于生活越来越富裕，这屯子生产劲头也越发大了。今年秋收才结束，十一月上旬就出去了二十四辆车运粮，半个月间就收入一亿多。叶振发换工互助组明年除去一切费用和娶媳妇、盖房子用两、三万斤粮外，还能余下六万八千六百斤粮，准备都用到扩大再生产上。许多户明年还要开荒，以往荒芜了的土地都已经种上了，明年将开垦新地，估计全屯可开垦七百五十亩，有五、六家没有耕畜的，今冬也都要买耕畜，雇农陈海生活比较困难，今年还娶了儿媳妇。他又把牛换成了马，与人合伙买了一辆车，雇农李万生自己买了一个新车，他们都要参加运粮。大家都要求优良种籽，有很多人设法到外县去串换。好使的除草机，开荒的洋犁，耙，农民都打算买。明年麦收时还希望使用苏联式收割机和打麦机收麦。
  确是普通一村
    虽然如此，东荣屯的生产情况在集贤县来说，还仅是一个一般的屯子。由于过去村干部领导不强，在前二年生产比别屯落后了一步；生产是一种自流的状态，互助组织也不好。在集贤县，一般的屯子差不多百分之八十以上的户都有了耕畜，而这屯却有三分之一的户还没有耕畜。在陆家油房屯八十二户中，只有十六户明年够吃够穿，生产资料足够，但没有余粮的算是全屯中的穷户，而东荣屯却仍有十三户人家明年生产资料不够充足，生活有困难。主要原因就是过去换工互助搞的不好，能自己单干时就不参加互助，因此多数没有做到深耕细作，劳力不够的户就少打了粮食。直到去年才产生了一个比较好的叶振发换工组，并起了推动作用，今年大家劲头都很大，有三、四个换工组和叶振发组比赛，做到了多铲多趟。但劳动效率还没有充分发挥，新的农业技术也还没有采用。因此这屯经济发展是比别屯落后了一步。
  起来，保家卫国
    但这屯毕竟是发展了，生活上升了，比以往幸福多了。不挨冻受饿而是吃得饱，穿得暖，有自己的房屋，土地，生产工具，耕畜，而且仓里有余粮了。
    正在今年收获之际，却传来美帝侵占我台湾，扰乱辽东、吉林边疆的消息，农民们听到这消息非常气愤，很快就有七名农民志愿赴朝参战。他们的家庭把余粮拿出来为他们的子弟置备服装，用具，棉大衣，好皮帽，新乌拉，裹腿，背包，干粮袋等，他们英勇地参加了保家卫国的斗争。公粮任务布置下来之后，妇女们立即掀起了选好公粮的热潮，家家挑好粮，大豆都经过粒选。农民正以满腔热情援助朝鲜邻邦，和保卫自己的幸福生活。
