Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association held its 25th meeting on the 19th of this month. Based on the resolution of the Enlarged Meeting of the General Association regarding "assisting local Federations of Industry and Commerce in promoting the Patriotic Pact signature campaign and suggesting the organization of inspections on the implementation of the pact," the meeting discussed implementation methods and notified local branches to comply. The methods stipulate that responsible persons from local branches of the China Democratic National Construction Association working in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and members serving the industrial and commercial sectors, should mobilize and promote all industries and households in the industrial and commercial sectors to strive to sign the Patriotic Pact. Regions that have already begun signing should organize inspections to ensure the effective implementation of the pact's provisions. For those who have not yet established a Patriotic Pact, it is suggested that the industrial and commercial sectors establish one and launch a signature campaign as soon as possible. The content of the pact must include an item on "actively paying taxes and guaranteeing supply."
