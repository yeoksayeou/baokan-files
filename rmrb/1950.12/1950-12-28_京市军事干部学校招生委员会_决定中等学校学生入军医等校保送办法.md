    Beijing News Agency Report: The Beijing Military Cadre School Enrollment Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th to report on the review and admission of students for military cadre schools such as air force, navy, tank, artillery, and air defense, and conveyed the decision of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission to recruit students for military medical and other schools. The meeting was attended by the chairpersons of the recommendation committees of all secondary schools in the city, as well as the heads of the Communist Party, Communist Youth League branches, and student unions, totaling 300 people.

    The registration of Beijing youth students to participate in air force and other schools began on the 13th of this month and ended on the 16th. In a short period of time, more than 5,200 students from secondary schools across the city registered, fully demonstrating the high patriotic enthusiasm of the youth students. The admission lists for each school were announced within the schools on the 27th.

    In order to meet the patriotic demands of the broad masses of young intellectuals and strengthen national defense, the General Political Department of the Military Commission issued a notice stipulating the enrollment methods for military medical, logistics, communications, public security, foreign language, and Russian language schools. The Beijing Enrollment Committee decided that students who were not admitted in the first round may be recommended by the school recommendation committees based on the principle of voluntary participation; students who did not register previously and are between the ages of 16 and 25 may also apply for recommendation. Physical examinations will no longer be handled uniformly by the Municipal Enrollment Committee, but will be the responsibility of the school's medical office. The registration procedures for each school are scheduled to end on the 28th. The Beijing enrollment work will strive to be completed before the end of the year.
