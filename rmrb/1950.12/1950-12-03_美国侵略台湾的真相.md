    The Truth About the US Aggression Against Taiwan
       Xu Li
    Currently, the UN Security Council is discussing the "Case of Accusation Against Armed Aggression Against Taiwan." Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, has already made a solemn accusation against the US aggression against Taiwan at the Security Council on the 28th of this month. We firmly support this just and solemn statement by Representative Wu. In order to make people more clearly understand the truth about the US aggression against Taiwan, this newspaper specially reports the situation of the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan after Japan's surrender as follows.
    (I)
    Since Japan's surrender, the US aggression against Taiwan can be roughly divided into three periods according to its development process. The first period was from Japan's surrender in 1945 to the failure of the US aggression against mainland China in 1949. During these four years, the US, through its running dog—the Kuomintang government, gradually infiltrated its power into Taiwan militarily, economically, and politically, and obtained Taiwan's military bases and controlled Taiwan's economic lifeline. Thus, the US actually replaced Japan's previous position in Taiwan. The second period was from after the US-Chiang troops were driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people to the start of the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. During this period, the US intensified its deployment of aggression against Taiwan, attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and actively turned Taiwan into the last reactionary stronghold for the US and its running dog, the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, against the People's Republic of China, and an important military base for the US aggression against Asia. The third period is from June 27th of this year when Truman openly ordered armed intervention in Taiwan by taking advantage of the Korean War, until now. Since then, the US policy toward Taiwan has developed from a long-term infiltration of aggression to a stage of open and direct armed occupation. Now, the US government is trying to use the name of the United Nations to achieve its aggressive goal of directly occupying Taiwan.
    (II)
    After Japan's surrender, the US military had already occupied Taiwan before the Chiang troops entered Taiwan in October 1945, and began its various activities to prepare for the occupation of Taiwan under the guise of assisting the Kuomintang government in "accepting the surrender" and "repatriating prisoners." US special agents and military intelligence personnel, under the command of Colonel Morgan, head of the US Army Intelligence Group, investigated various military strongholds and their military equipment in Taiwan. Around October 25, 1946, MacArthur, the executor of the US Far East aggressive policy, and Chiang Kai-shek and Song Ziwen secretly discussed the conditions for selling out Taiwan at the Caoshan Guesthouse in Taipei. In this meeting, the Kuomintang government recognized the special status of the US in Taiwan, and the US began to obtain the privilege of controlling major enterprises, ports, and building military bases in Taiwan. After US President's special envoy Wedemeyer arrived in Taiwan in August 1947, the US aggressive activities in Taiwan became increasingly active. In the second half of 1947, under the planning of the US government, Kiyoshi Hasegawa, the former Governor-General of Japan in Taiwan, and Yoshisuke Aikawa, the former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industry Company, who had just been released from Sugamo Prison by MacArthur, were all sheltered by the US to go to Taiwan to serve as tools for US aggressors and participate in various activities of US aggression against Taiwan. During this period, the US successively established its air force bases and communication radio stations at Songshan Airport in Taipei, Taichung Airport, Tainan Airport, and Hsinchu Airport, and sent military aircraft from the 13th Air Force of the Pacific to take aerial photos of the entire island of Taiwan and explore the climate in Taiwan. Military aircraft were stationed at various air force bases in Taiwan. From July 5, 1948, Tainan Airport was forbidden for Chinese civil aviation aircraft to land, and was completely occupied by the US Air Force. Hsinchu Airport was the largest air force base when Japan occupied Taiwan. After Japan surrendered, it became the base of the new aggressive armed forces—the US 13th Air Force. At the same time, the US gradually turned Keelung and Kaohsiung ports into its naval bases. In the spring of 1948, Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, led the fleet to Taiwan, forcing the Kuomintang government, which originally intended to conceal the sale of the seaports, to formally announce that Keelung and Qingdao were both ports for free mooring of the US Navy. In addition, Zuoying in Kaohsiung was originally the No. 1 military port in the Far East that Japan had started building with a ten-year plan during the Pacific War but had not completed. After Japan surrendered, it was taken over by the Kuomintang government and then, under the supervision and planning of the US, it was also built into a naval base. This seaport and another naval fortress occupied by the US—Magong Island in Penghu—face each other from east to west and are both military strongholds for controlling the Taiwan Strait. From that time on, US naval vessels continued to invade our territorial waters and moor in various seaports in Taiwan. In terms of the army, a large number of active-duty officers of the US "Joint Military Advisory Group" have long been stationed in Taiwan, and are responsible for organizing, equipping, and training the so-called Kuomintang "new army" used to attack the Chinese people, according to the war plans of the US and Chiang Kai-shek. According to a report in the Nanyang Siang Pau on September 13, 1950, the US had established twelve officer training groups and twelve soldier training groups in Taiwan at the beginning of last year. Every field combat exercise of the Chiang troops in Taiwan was commanded by the US military advisory group, and the remnant soldiers of the Chiang bandits have actually been reduced to mercenary soldiers of the US imperialists. In this way, the US has actually replaced Japan in the military and controlled Taiwan.
    Economically, after Japan's surrender in 1945, the US sent many experts to Taiwan to investigate resources, and under the guise of "helping Taiwan's industrial revival," sent many technicians to Taiwan to control the technical departments of important enterprises, such as the Kaohsiung Cement Factory, the Kaohsiung Aluminum Factory, and the Taichung No. 3 Airport. The technicians were exclusively occupied by Americans. In the US-Chiang negotiations in October 1946, the US, through the Kuomintang government's traitorous actions, obtained various privileges in Taiwan to "freely operate various enterprises" and for US capital to "restore and build" Taiwan's hydroelectric power plants and "open Keelung and Kaohsiung as international free ports." In 1947, the clutches of US monopoly capital gradually invaded Taiwan, and US companies successively established branches or offices in Taiwan. In February 1948, the US and the Chiang Kai-shek government further formally signed the "Joint Development" agreement for Taiwan. The US decided to provide a large number of technicians and capital to the Kuomintang, and thereby obtained the privilege of mining Taiwan's coal, oil, tungsten, antimony, gold, sulfur and other mineral resources (see Shanghai Continental Report in April 1948). In June of the same year, a US aid technical survey team headed by Steel arrived in Taiwan and conducted a detailed survey of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises, railways, transportation and water conservancy. Immediately afterwards, in August of the same year, the US sent special envoy Wedemeyer to Taiwan to convene secret meetings and various special meetings with the heads of the Kuomintang departments and bureaus in Taiwan and the heads of the top ten companies of the puppet Resources Committee, to study and formulate specific plans for the US to control Taiwan's economy. From then on, US monopoly capital that invaded Taiwan gradually occupied and manipulated Taiwan's economic lifeline through various means. First, the US tried to control the power industry, which plays a decisive role in Taiwan's entire economy. According to the news confessed by the Taiwan Chiang bandit news agency on April 13, 1948, and reported by the Shanghai Times on April 17 of the same year, the US Westinghouse Electric Corporation signed a loan contract with Taiwan Power Company in 1948, stipulating that the US would provide loans and, under US supervision, restore and build Taiwan's power industry. The US Westinghouse Electric Corporation sent a special representative to participate in the Taiwan Power Company Fund Management Committee. It obtained the privilege of manipulating Taiwan's power industry by supplying half of the value of the equipment needed for Taiwan to restore power plants. The company has now controlled Taiwan's most important thirty-four power plants, thereby indirectly controlling other industries that rely on these power plants for electricity. Secondly, the US, through the Resource Committee of the Kuomintang government, controlled Taiwan's major enterprises, including cement, aluminum, sugar, electricity, and gold and copper mines, by operating "state-owned enterprises." As is well known, US capital accounts for one-third of the Kuomintang's Resource Committee, so US forces can intervene in all "state-owned enterprises" in Taiwan under the Resource Committee. For example, according to a message released by the US United Press on March 26, 1948, the US Second Aluminum Monopoly Company, Reynolds Metals Company, signed a contract with the Resources Committee, investing 35 million US dollars to form the "China Aluminum Company," thereby monopolizing the entire aluminum metal industry in Taiwan. For example, in Taiwan's sugarcane industry, the US, through the Resources Committee, controlled the largest sugar monopoly organization in Taiwan, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, invested a large amount of capital, and dispatched a number of technical advisors, so that more than 60% of Taiwan's sugar factories were under the control of US monopoly capital. Taiwan's cement industry is controlled by the US Transport Company. Third, the US gradually controlled Taiwan's agricultural production through the activities of the so-called "Sino-US Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee." It monopolized the production and marketing of chemical fertilizers, which are indispensable in Taiwan's agricultural production, and colluded with the Chiang bandits to forcibly occupy a large amount of land in Taiwan, organized so-called "cooperative farms," and forced the Taiwanese people to plant a large amount of sugarcane and camphor, which are most beneficial to US monopoly capital, under the guidance of US "agricultural technology," making Taiwan a purely dependent and subordinate colonial economy of the US. Fourth, through the so-called economic assistance from the Economic Cooperation Administration, the US dumped its surplus commodities such as cotton, soybeans, and fertilizers in Taiwan, occupied the Taiwan market, and accelerated the bankruptcy of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises, which were already squeezed by the Chiang bandit bureaucratic capital. On the other hand, under the guise of economic assistance, the US further penetrated into various economic fields in Taiwan. At the same time, the US also controlled Taiwan's foreign trade, and even the prices of Taiwan's exports had to be decided by the US authorities. All the above facts fully demonstrate that the US policy toward Taiwan is an imperialist aggressive colonial policy. Due to US aggression, Taiwan has essentially fallen into the abyss of a colony.
    Parallel to the above-mentioned military and economic aggression, the US imperialists have long been engaged in malicious political conspiracies in Taiwan. With the US consulate in Taiwan as the center, they have cultivated pro-American forces and brewed and manufactured the so-called "trusteeship of Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence" movements. In February 1947, when Taiwan experienced a popular uprising against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, Cadoo, the head of the US Information Service in Taiwan, openly came forward to try to use the anti-Chiang sentiments of the Taiwanese people to incite a "independence movement" to separate Taiwan from mainland China, but failed due to opposition from all parties. In August of the same year, Liao Wenyi, a running dog raised by the US, submitted a so-called "opinion on handling the Taiwan issue" after meeting with Wedemeyer, saying that the United Nations should "trusteeship Taiwan" and "make Taiwan a permanent neutral country." Subsequently, the US news agency continued to expand and promote the "Taiwan separation movement." At the same time, Cadoo, the head of the US Information Service, also released the air that "before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, the ownership of Taiwan has not been officially determined." Cadoo claimed: "Taiwan is now under MacArthur's jurisdiction," "If the Taiwanese people are willing to break away from Chinese rule, the United States can help." (See Taipei Communication from Hong Kong's "Hua Shang Pao" on October 15, 1947). In 1948, under the instruction of the US authorities, the "Taiwan Independence League" and other puppet organizations, with US running dog Liao Wenyi as chairman, successively issued declarations requesting the US to help "Taiwan independence." In September of the same year, the US intelligence agency in Taiwan forged a petition signed by various puppet organizations and submitted it to MacArthur's headquarters, formally proposing "requesting the United Nations to send troops to occupy Taiwan." (See Tokyo Electric Power of the United Press on September 22, 1948) Because at that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had achieved a basic victory in mainland China, the Kuomintang government had collapsed, and the Taiwanese people were very angry with Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny, so the US authorities were eager to carry out exploratory activities for their political conspiracies, trying to find an excuse to create a basis for the US to directly monopolize Taiwan.
    (III)
    In 1949, with the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's army on the mainland of China, Taiwan, as the last nest of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, became more and more valued by the US aggressors. MacArthur once publicly stated: Taiwan is a "springboard for aggression to the south," it is "the main link in the transportation and communication chain extending from Japan through Okinawa and the Philippines to Southeast Asia," and if Taiwan is liberated by us, "the center of the US front position and the strategic importance of the southern flank will be offset or completely submerged." (See MacArthur's speech to the US Overseas War Veterans Association Congress on August 28 this year.) It is precisely because Taiwan occupies such an important "strategic value" in the US overall plan of aggression that after the liberation of mainland China, although Truman issued a false statement of "non-interference in Taiwan" on January 5 this year, he actually continued to support the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang gathered in Taiwan more actively and intensively, preventing our People's Republic of China from liberating Taiwan, and attempting to make Taiwan completely a Pacific strategic base under the direct control of the United States. To this end, in November 1949, the US and the Taiwan Kuomintang reactionary remnant group concluded a military secret agreement stipulating that the US would continue to supply weapons and equipment for five divisions of the Kuomintang, sixteen warships, as well as radar equipment and aircraft parts, etc. In addition, the US also allowed the appropriation of 90 million yuan of remaining aid funds to the bandits, and handed over the US Congress's so-called: "75 million US dollars appropriated for general areas of China" to the Taiwan remnants. The Kuomintang remnant group, on the other hand, agreed to the following conditions: First, reorganize the Taiwan remnant bandit government according to US instructions; Second, the US government will send a military mission to Taiwan and obtain the right to fully control Taiwan's military, political and economic affairs. The agreement stipulates that if this still cannot prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing, the US imperialists will directly occupy Taiwan under the pretext of asking the United Nations to come forward.
    During this period, the US actively reorganized the Kuomintang remnant armed forces that fled to Taiwan, continued to increase military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits, and further controlled Taiwan through its military mission's supervision of the use of "US aid" by the Taiwan Chiang bandits. In terms of the air force, according to the Associated Press, in November 1949, 100 heavy bombers were transported from California to Taiwan via Guam. In March 1950, another 25 aircraft were transported to Taiwan. The US authorities in Japan also actively recruited Japanese air force personnel for the Chiang bandits to participate in destructive activities of bombing mainland China. At the same time, the US Navy Department announced on December 29, 1949 that it would send the 27,000-ton Boxer aircraft carrier and two destroyers to Asian waters to expand the US Seventh Special Fleet in preparation for aggression against Taiwan. At that time, the US Navy claimed: "The Seventh Special Fleet constitutes a mobile force, ready to support the US national policy and serve as a force of stability in the Western Pacific." This measure was a predetermined step prepared by the US for openly armed intervention in Taiwan later. In coordination with this, in addition to the US withdrawing the "Joint Military Advisory Group" in mainland China to Taiwan led by Badawi in 1949, it also successively dispatched military advisors and experts to Taiwan to strengthen control over the remnant institutions and plan the military deployment of the Taiwan remnants to continue fighting against the Chinese people. According to materials published in US newspapers, as of January 1950, "more than 100 US so-called 'retired' officers had been sent to Taiwan. Under the direct command of US military advisors, the US imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang, actively took measures to strengthen the air and naval bases in Taiwan. A large number of military equipment transported to Taiwan was also quickly used to equip the Kuomintang remnant armed forces and newly trained troops. According to a report by the US news agency, in February 1950, 100 US tanks and military trucks were shipped to Taiwan via the Philippines (Note 10), and another 100 tanks were shipped to Taiwan in March. The Kuomintang remnant bandit gang also purchased various military supplies from the US through the New York International Business Company (Note 11). In addition, Truman has approved MacArthur's suggestion to "organize an 'International Volunteer Army' of retired US and Japanese army, navy and air force personnel to assist Chiang in defending Taiwan." According to a report in the New York "Sunday Compass" on June 4, the "International Volunteer Army" personnel who have arrived in Taiwan include 150 US and Japanese naval and air force generals, including former commander-in-chief of the Japanese invasion of China expeditionary army and current chief advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, Okamura Neiji, and Lieutenant General Nemoto Hiroshi. Since then, a large number of fascist soldiers recruited by the Chiang bandits with the support of the US imperialists have continued to pour into Taiwan. In August 1949, more than 200 Japanese naval personnel arrived in Pingtung and Hsinchu in Taiwan, and in October of the same year, 1,670 Japanese air force personnel arrived in Okayama in Taiwan, and 2,000 naval personnel arrived in Hsinchu in Taiwan. In late December of the same year, MacArthur sent another Japanese advisory group of 15 people to Taipei. Now, MacArthur continues to train Japanese air force personnel in Japan in preparation for sending them to Taiwan to participate in the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang's operations against the Chinese people. Regarding the fact that the US imperialists organized Japanese troops to go to Taiwan to help the bandits fight, (23) the Japanese government and US officials in Tokyo have admitted it. On October 12, 1949, Justice Minister Ueda of the Japanese government confessed in response to an inquiry in the House of Representatives: "Some 'volunteers' have actually gone to Taiwan to join the Kuomintang army." The US official news agency also confirmed this. For example, on December 2 of the same year, Tokyo Electric Power of the United Press stated: "A senior official of the occupation authorities said that the news that former senior army officers stationed in Taiwan are organizing a Japanese foreign air force brigade to fight for the Kuomintang is true."
    What should be given more attention is that the military measures taken by the US against Taiwan "are not simply limited to the military defense of 'Taiwan' itself, but are deployed as a component of the US overall strategic plan in the Pacific. In November 1949, the US instigated the Taiwan Chiang bandits to discuss with the Lee Seung-man puppet regime in Korea about using the South Korean air force base to bomb mainland China. In the same month, US Far East Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Stratemeyer and MacArthur's Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Willoughby held a Pacific defense conference in Manila with the Philippine Joint Chiefs of Staff and discussed the Taiwan issue. Subsequently, in December 1949, US Ambassador to the Philippines Cowen, Philippine President Quirino, and Kuomintang bandit gang ambassador Chen Zhiping held a "triangular meeting" in Baguio to determine strengthening the "connection between Taiwan and the Philippines' military efforts," "closely exchanging intelligence on common security," and using the Philippines as a transit point for the US to transport military supplies to aid the Taiwan Kuomintang remnant bandits. Later, the US Far East diplomatic personnel conference held in Bangkok in February 1950, and the meeting between US Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and State Department Special Advisor Dulles in Tokyo with MacArthur in June, specifically discussed the Taiwan issue. All these activities clearly indicate that the US has included Taiwan in its entire aggressive system in the Far East.
    Around this aggressive plot, on February 14, 1950, the US President, in the "Aid China Act" he signed, decided to extend the deadline for the use of the remaining aid funds of 104 million US dollars from February 15 to June 30 (see Washington Electric Power of the Associated Press on February 15). On March 21 of this year, the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee specifically passed a resolution to allocate 50 million US dollars from the remaining unused funds under the above-mentioned 1948 Aid China Act to aid the Kuomintang remnant bandits. On May 23 of this year, the US Congress passed the "Foreign Economic Assistance Act" for the next year. The act stipulates that 40 million US dollars will be allocated from the 75 million US dollars used for "general areas of China" to support Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits in Taiwan (Washington Electric Power of the Associated Press on May 24). At this time, the activities of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in Taiwan have also been significantly strengthened. A large number of military supplies such as US sleepers, gasoline, munitions, machinery, and parts have been successively shipped from the US to Taiwan. According to Muir's report in May of this year, the value of monthly imported materials shipped to Taiwan from the US averaged 2.2 million US dollars per month. In addition, the US has strengthened trade between Taiwan and Japan. According to Shao Yizhou, the business director of the Kuomintang delegation in Japan, the total value of Taiwan's export trade to Japan in 1949 reached 30 million US dollars. MacArthur's headquarters ordered Japan to transport a large number of military metals, military equipment, and sea vessels to aid the Taiwan Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. This is a part of the US aid to Chiang Kai-shek's plan, and it also further forces Taiwan to become a vassal of the US-dominated Japanese economic system.
    It is precisely because the US ambitions for Taiwan are so arrogant that when the US aggressors face the new situation in which the Chinese people have achieved great victories and will continue to liberate Taiwan, it has caused deep panic and anxiety. Therefore, the US authorities are eager to find an opportunity and create various excuses to publicly declare the established facts caused by its long-term infiltration and aggression as a "legal" occupation. To this end, as early as March 1949, MacArthur publicly shouted: "Taiwan still belongs to the Allied forces before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty." Subsequently, US Secretary of State Acheson also said: "Although Taiwan has been added to China's territory, technically speaking, Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan." Then, US Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley went to Tokyo in June to discuss new deployments for the occupation of Taiwan with MacArthur. According to a report from Tokyo by the United Press reporter on June 20, Johnson and Bradley proposed to Truman a plan to support the Kuomintang remnant bandits in obstructing the liberation of Taiwan after returning to the US from Tokyo. The New York Herald Tribune on June 25 more specifically revealed the content of this plan. The report claimed: "Headquarters officials firmly believe that if prompt action is taken according to the following principles, the Communists may not even dare to launch an attack on Taiwan. The United States should issue a strong public statement stating that the final disposal of the former Japanese island of Taiwan must wait for the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Before the conclusion of the peace treaty, Taiwan will be managed by the United States or the United Nations. At the same time as the release of this statement, a large-scale military delegation should be sent, and the naval strength should be displayed." Sure enough, within two days, after the US government instructed the Lee Seung-man group to provoke the Korean War, Truman issued a statement on June 27, openly announcing that the US government had decided to directly occupy Taiwan by force. It can be seen that the US plan for armed intervention in Taiwan had actually been determined long before President Truman publicly announced it. Acheson's reiteration of Truman's statement on January 5 on June 23 was nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up this conspiracy.
    (IV)
    The publication of Truman's statement on June 27, 1950, showed that the US policy toward Taiwan had developed from a long-term infiltration of aggression to a stage of open and direct armed occupation. This is the inevitable result of the US long-standing conspiracy to aggress against Taiwan, and it is also a serious step by the US to expand the war in the Far East.
    After Truman announced this general policy of armed occupation of Taiwan, he ordered MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the US Far East Army, to go to Taiwan and secretly discuss with Chiang Kai-shek the specific steps for the occupation of Taiwan. On July 31, MacArthur, accompanied by his Chief of Staff Major General Almond, Far East Navy Commander Lieutenant General Joy, Seventh Fleet Commander Lieutenant General Struble, Far East Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Stratemeyer, and He Shili, head of the Kuomintang remnant bandit military delegation stationed in Japan, arrived in Taipei from Tokyo. The MacArthur-Chiang talks decided that the US and Taiwan's naval, land, and air forces would be under the unified command of MacArthur to "jointly defend" Taiwan. In addition to the Seventh Fleet, the US sent the 13th Air Force to be stationed in Taiwan, and established a "military liaison office" in Taiwan. It also stipulated that "US troops can freely use Taiwan's air force bases," and "the ammunition, gasoline, military supplies and all combat weapons needed by Taiwan's naval, land, and air forces will be supplemented by the US Far East Army Headquarters." Obviously, this is a specific step by the US to use the Chiang bandits' manpower and material resources to ensure its armed occupation of Taiwan in preparation for attacking the People's Republic of China. This military conspiracy was not only revealed by the US United Press reporter, but was also confirmed by the joint communiqué issued by MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek on the same day. When MacArthur left Taiwan and returned to Japan on August 1, he publicly declared: "Effective liaison between the US military under my command and the Chinese government (referring to the Taiwan Kuomintang reactionary government) army has been completed." MacArthur also stated that the policy of armed intervention in Taiwan was his "responsibility and resolute purpose." On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek also stated: "In the successive meetings held by us and MacArthur in the past two days, unanimous opinions have been obtained on various related issues. The foundation for jointly defending Taiwan and Sino-US military cooperation has been laid." (Central News Agency Taipei Electric Power on August 1). This development shows that the US has not only armed and occupied Taiwan, but has also decided to have MacArthur command the joint US-Chiang armed forces to undermine our People's Republic of China's legitimate actions to liberate Taiwan. This is obviously a war provocation by the US government against the Chinese people, and a wanton act of open armed aggression against China.
    Since then, the US aggressive activities against Taiwan have become more tense and blatant. The US 13th Air Force and the Seventh Fleet, which were ordered to occupy Taiwan, had arrived in Taiwan at the end of June, and carried out patrol and reconnaissance activities in our territorial waters and airspace and their periphery. According to a report from Taipei by the New York Herald Tribune reporter on July 24, the scope of the US fleet's intrusion into our territorial waters for patrol activities ranged from the sea off Shantou, Guangdong in the south to the sea outside Qingdao Port, Shandong in the north, a coastline of 1,000 miles long. In order to unify the command of the naval and air forces in Taiwan, MacArthur ordered his Deputy Chief of Staff Fox to lead a military mission to Taiwan on August 4. This military mission was initially called the "MacArthur Headquarters Military Liaison Group in Taiwan," and was later renamed the "US Far East Army Inspection Group in Taiwan." On October 3, the US government released a deceptive smokescreen, saying that it would recall this "inspection group" to Japan. But in fact, the US military commanders are still working in the same office with the Kuomintang remnants in the Taiwan Defense Headquarters, jointly planning the military deployment to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan.
    Simultaneous with the US launching direct armed aggression against Taiwan, the US imperialist economic aggression against Taiwan has also undergone new developments. First, the US Economic Cooperation Administration decided to focus on "strengthening Taiwan's war industrial potential" in the three-month aid to Taiwan plan starting in July. Muir also confessed in his report to the Economic Cooperation Administration on October 6: The US has assisted Taiwan in "making the most effective use of its limited resources," and "Taiwan's industrial plan mainly focuses on the development of railways, highways, ports, electricity, mining, and forests." The Economic Cooperation Administration "supplies the equipment and supplementary conditions necessary for Taiwan's power system, railways, highways, telecommunications and transportation systems." The report also pointed out that since July, the materials supplied to Taiwan by the US Economic Cooperation Administration have increased from the previous monthly average value of 2.2 million US dollars to a monthly average of 3.3 million US dollars. According to a report from the US Information Service on September 22, the funds from the Economic Cooperation Administration to aid the Taiwan Kuomintang remnant bandits have totaled 183,628,000 US dollars. Secondly, the US further controls Taiwan's financial revenue and expenditure. According to a report by the Kuomintang official news agency, after MacArthur Headquarters Major General Marquette and Taiwan Finance Minister Yan Jia-kan, Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wu Guozhen, Finance Director Ren Xianqun, and US Aid Utilization Committee Secretary General Wang Chongzhi discussed Taiwan's financial and economic issues on August 1, MacArthur Headquarters sent financial expert Morse to Taiwan to investigate the financial situation of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, and then sent tax experts to investigate the tax situation in Taiwan. Thirdly, the US ordered Japan, under its control, to formally sign a trade agreement with Taiwan on September 6. The agreement stipulates that from July 1 this year to June 31 next year, Taiwan will export goods worth 50 million US dollars to Japan, and Japan will also export goods worth 50 million US dollars to Taiwan. (See Kuomintang Central News Agency Tokyo Electric Power on September 6) This will make Taiwan completely serve the economic system of the US-dominated Far East aggressive group centered on Japan, in order to organize its economic power for the needs of aggressive warfare.
    Finally, and most importantly, the US is stepping up its efforts to use the name of the United Nations in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to annex Taiwan under the guise of "peacefully resolving the Taiwan issue." This can be clearly seen from the recent remarks of Truman, Acheson, and Austin. They said: "The future status of Taiwan must wait for the restoration of Pacific security, the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, or the consideration of the United Nations." The US delegation's proposal to the UN General Assembly of the so-called "future status of Formosa" issue is a specific step to realize this conspiracy. The US is attempting to create a "status of Taiwan" issue that does not exist at all, in order to divert people's attention from our country's protest against US aggression, and to make the handling of the case of accusation against armed aggression against Taiwan by the United Nations achieve a result that is beneficial to the US aggressive purpose. Not long ago, a US State Department official said at a press conference in Washington on September 1: "The purpose of US policy is to find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue through negotiations at the United Nations and the Japanese peace treaty." But at the same time, he also claimed: "Although the State Department plans to withdraw the Seventh Fleet from the Taiwan Strait after the Korean War, it will maintain a strong army and navy in the areas near Taiwan," and said: "The US troops stationed in the Pacific will be prepared to quickly return to the sea off Taiwan when necessary" (Washington Electric Power of the United Press on September 1). This remark by the US State Department official has revealed the truth of the matter. That is to say, the form of US occupation of Taiwan may take various forms, but the essence of its armed occupation of Taiwan will not change in any way.
    (V)
    It can be seen that the US naval and air forces' intrusion into Taiwan is clearly the most open and blatant aggression against Chinese territory. This wanton and illegal act is by no means a "temporary measure" caused by the Korean War as Truman sophistically argued, but is actually a long-term conspiracy of US aggression. The US armed occupation of Taiwan, its launching of the war of aggression against Korea, and its armed intervention in Vietnam are all serious military aggressive steps taken with a plan in order to encircle the People's Republic of China and further aggress against mainland China and various Asian countries. On November 28, US representative Dulles defended at the Security Council that the US only had "forty-four" military personnel in Taiwan. He attempted to use this false statement to prove that the US had not aggressed against Taiwan. But the fact is that the US not only has its military command in Taiwan, but also has its Air Force 13th Air Force, its Navy Seventh Fleet, and controls the entire Taiwan's naval and air bases. Are these not solid evidence of the US armed occupation of Taiwan? This ironclad historical fact cannot be covered up no matter how the US defends itself.
    The US armed intervention in Taiwan is obviously not, as Truman sophistically argued, to "localize" the Korean War, but is precisely expanding the Korean War and is a planned step to burn the flames of aggression against Korea to the territory of our great motherland. In fact, due to the US actively arming Japan, the US occupation of Korea and Taiwan, and the US armed intervention in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia, the security and peace in the Pacific have been undermined, and the crisis of expanding the war in the Far East is growing. The US troops aggressing against Korea brazenly crossed the 38th parallel and approached our Northeast border. The planes of the US troops aggressing against Korea, ignoring our country's repeated protests, have expanded from bombing our Northeast Yalu River coastal towns and cities to intruding into the airspace over Benxi and Liaoyang in our Northeast inland. These are clearly specific steps by the US imperialists to expand the war of aggression. Didn't US President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson say that the occupation of Taiwan was a "military neutral action" to ensure the security of the "left flank of the United Nations position"? When the Security Council discussed the US aggression against Taiwan case on November 28, US representative Dulles repeated this old tune. But may I ask: In order to protect the security of other wings of the so-called "United Nations position," such as the right wing, the left wing of the left wing, and the right wing of the left wing, or the security of its front and rear, isn't it necessary to expand its aggressive area even more? This is of course the same logic as the US wanting to establish its naval and air bases all over the world and sending its naval, land, and air forces to invade the territorial sovereignty of other countries under the pretext of maintaining the so-called "security of US national defense." This is the truth of the US imperialist policy of world expansion and world war. Its purpose is clearly not to "localize" the war, but to expand it! Not to maintain peace, but to expand the war!
    This crazy US policy of aggressive war has aroused new anger among the Chinese and Asian people, and has also aroused the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. Our 475 million people of the People's Republic of China have learned profound lessons from the US long-standing crimes of aggression. No tricks of the US aggressors can deceive the Chinese people. Our government of the People's Republic of China and the people of the whole country not only have the firm will to liberate Taiwan, but also have sufficient strength to

    美国侵略台湾的真相
       徐立
    目前，联合国安理会正在讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾案”。中华人民共和国中央人民政府的特派代表伍修权，已于本月二十八日在安理会上对美国侵略台湾的罪行提出了严正的控诉。我们坚决拥护伍代表这个正义的庄严的声明。为使人们更清楚认识美国侵略台湾的真相，本报特将日本投降后美帝侵略台湾的经过情况，综合报道如下。
    （一）
    日本投降以来，美国对台湾的侵略，按其发展过程来说，大体可分为三个时期。第一个时期，从一九四五年日本投降到一九四九年美国在中国大陆的侵略遭受失败为止。在这四年中间，美国通过其走狗——国民党政府，把自己的势力从军事上、经济上、政治上逐步渗入台湾，取得了台湾的军事基地，控制了台湾的经济命脉，从而美国便实际代替了以往日本在台湾的地位。第二个时期，是在美蒋军队被中国人民赶出中国大陆之后到美帝侵略朝鲜战争发动为止。在这时期内，美国更加紧了侵略台湾的部署，图谋阻止中国人民解放台湾，并积极地把台湾变成美国及其走狗国民党残余匪帮反对中华人民共和国的最后反动堡垒，变成美国侵略亚洲的一个重要军事基地。第三个时期，从今年六月二十七日杜鲁门利用朝鲜战争的机会公开下令武装干涉台湾开始，一直到现在。从此，美国对台湾的政策，就由长期渗透的侵略活动，发展到公开的直接武装侵占的阶段。现在，美国政府正图谋利用联合国的名义，以实现其直接占领台湾的侵略目的。
    （二）
    日本投降以后，美国军队在一九四五年十月蒋军进驻台湾以前，即已占驻台湾，并以协助国民党政府“受降”及“遣俘”的名义，开始其准备侵占台湾的各种活动。美国特务及军事情报人员在美国陆军情报组长摩根上校（Col.Morgan）的指挥下，调查了台湾各军事要地及其军事设备。一九四六年十月二十五日前后，美国远东侵略政策的执行人麦克阿瑟曾与蒋介石、宋子文，在台北草山宾馆秘密会商出卖台湾的条件，国民党政府在这次会议中，承认美国在台湾的特殊地位，美国由此开始取得了控制台湾主要企业，港口及建筑军事基地的特权。一九四七年八月间美国总统特使魏德迈到台湾后，美国侵台的活动便日益开展起来。一九四七年下半年，在美国政府的策划之下，原任日本驻台湾总督的长谷川清，及由麦克阿瑟刚从巢鸭监狱释放出来的前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等等侵华要犯，均由美国庇护前往台湾充当美国侵略者的工具，参与美国侵略台湾的各种活动。美国在这个时期内，先后在台北松山机场，台中机场，台南机场和新竹机场建立了它的空军基地及联络电台等设备，并由太平洋十三航空队派出军用飞机，摄取台湾全岛的地形照片，探测台湾地区的气候，军用飞机则常驻于台湾各空军基地。从一九四八年七月五日起，台南机场禁止中国民航机降落，而完全由美国空军所占用。新竹机场原是日本占领台湾时的最大空军基地，日本投降之后，则便成为新的侵略武装——美国十三航空队的基地了。同时，美国又逐步把基隆与高雄两港变为它的海军基地。一九四八年春，美国西太平洋舰队司令柯克率领舰队进抵台湾，逼使原拟隐瞒出卖海港的国民党政府不得不正式发表基隆与青岛同为美国海军自由碇泊的港口。此外，高雄的左营，原是日本在太平洋战争中以十年计划开始建筑而未完成的远东第一军港，日本投降后，经由国民党政府接收，继即也在美国的监督与策划之下，修筑为海军基地，这个海港与另一个为美国所侵占的海军要塞——澎湖的马公岛，东西相望，同为控制台湾海峡的军事要地。从那个时候起，美国的海军舰艇，便继续不断地侵入我国领海，并碇泊于台湾各海港。在陆军方面，美国的“联合军事顾问团”老早就派出大批现役军官常驻台湾，按照美国及蒋介石的战争计划，负责组织、装备及训练用以进攻中国人民的所谓国民党“新军”。据一九五○年九月十三日南侨日报报道，去年年初美在台湾已成立十二个军官训练小组，和十二个士兵训练小组。蒋军在台湾的每次实地战斗演习，都由美军顾问团指挥，蒋匪的残兵，实际已沦为美帝的雇佣士兵了。这样，美国在军事上实际已代替日本，控制了台湾。
    在经济方面，美国在一九四五年日本投降后，就派出许多专家前往台湾调查资源，并在“帮助台湾产业复兴”的名义下，派遣许多技术人员到台湾控制重要企业的技术部门，例如高雄水泥工厂，高雄制铝工厂，及台中第三飞机场的技术人员，均为美人所独占。一九四六年十月美蒋谈判中，美国经由国民党政府的卖国行动，取得了在台湾“自由经营各种企业”，并由美国资本“恢复建设”台湾水力发电厂及“开放基隆、高雄为国际自由港”的各种特权。一九四七年美国独占资本的魔手便逐渐侵入台湾，美国公司纷纷在台湾设立分行或办事处。一九四八年二月，美国与蒋介石政府更进一步正式签订了“共同开发”台湾的协定。美国决定以大批技术人员及资本供给国民党，并由此取得开采台湾煤、石油、钨、锑、黄金、硫磺等等矿产资源的特权（参见一九四八年四月份上海大陆报）。同年六月，以史蒂尔为首的美援技术调查团抵台，详细调查了台湾的工矿企业、铁路、交通及水利的情况。紧接着在同年八月间，美国即派遣特使魏德迈到台湾，召集台湾的国民党各厅处局长，和伪资源委员会十大公司负责人举行秘密会议及各种专门会议，研究并制定了美国控制台湾经济的具体方案，从此，侵入台湾的美国独占资本，便通过各种方式，逐渐侵占与操纵了台湾的经济命脉。首先，美国设法控制对台湾整个经济起决定作用的电力工业。据一九四八年四月十三日台湾蒋匪新闻社所供认的消息，及同年四月十七日上海泰晤士报的报导，美国的威斯丁豪斯电气公司曾于一九四八年与台湾电力公司签订一个借款合同，确定由美国借款，并在美国监督之下，恢复与建设台湾电力工业。美国威斯丁豪斯电气公司派有专门代表，参加台湾电力公司基金管理委员会，它以供给台湾恢复发电厂所需设备价值的半数而取得操纵台湾电力工业的特权。该公司现已控制了台湾最主要的三十四个发电厂，从而，也间接控制了依靠这些发电厂供给电力的其他工业。其次，美国通过国民党政府的资源委员会，以经营“国营企业”的方式，控制了台湾的主要企业，包括水泥、铝业、糖业、电力及金铜矿等五大企业部门。如众所周知，在国民党的资源委员会中，美国资本占了三分之一，所以，凡是由资源委员会所管的台湾各“国营企业”，美国势力均可以插足。例如，据一九四八年三月二十六日美国联合新闻社所发表的消息，美国第二铝业独占公司雷诺金属公司经由与资源委员会签订合同，投资三千五百万美元，以合组“中国铝业公司”的形式，而垄断了全台湾的铝金属工业。又如台湾的蔗糖工业，美国曾经过资源委员会，控制了台匪最大的糖业独占组织，台湾糖业公司投入了大批资本，派遣了若干技术顾问，因而使台湾百分之六十以上的糖厂，均在美国独占资本的控制之下。台湾的水泥工业则为美国通运公司所控制。其三，美国通过所谓“中美农村复兴联合委员会”的活动，逐步控制了台湾的农业生产。它垄断了台湾农业生产中不可缺少的化学肥料的生产和运销，并勾结蒋匪强占台湾的大批土地，组织所谓“合作农场”，强制台湾人民在美国“农业技术”的指导之下，大量种植对美国独占资本最有利的甘蔗和樟脑，使台湾纯粹成为依赖与附属于美国的殖民地化经济。其四，通过经合总署的所谓经济援助，美国一方面在台湾大量倾销其棉花、大豆、肥料等等剩余商品，占领了台湾市场，致使原在蒋匪官僚资本压榨下的台湾中小企业更加速地陷于破产的厄运，另一方面，又在经济援助的名义下，使美国势力进一步渗透侵入台湾的各个经济领域。同时，美国并控制了台湾的对外贸易甚至连台湾输出的价格，均须由美国当局决定。上述这一切事实，充分说明了美国对台湾的政策，乃是帝国主义的侵略的殖民地政策，由于美国的侵略，实质上台湾早已陷于殖民地的深渊。
    与上述军事及经济的侵略相并行的，美帝老早就在台湾进行恶毒的政治阴谋，它以美国驻台湾的领事馆为中心，扶植亲美势力，酝酿与制造所谓“托管台湾”及“台湾独立”的运动。一九四七年二月，台湾发生反对蒋介石反动统治的人民暴动时，美国驻台的新闻处长卡度，即公开出面活动企图利用台湾人民反蒋的情绪，煽动台湾与中国大陆分离的“独立运动”，后因遭受各方反对而失败。同年八月，美国所豢养的走狗廖文毅在与魏德迈会见后，提出一个所谓“处理台湾问题的意见书”，说什么要联合国来“托管台湾”，“使台湾成为永久中立国”。接着美国通讯社，就继续不断地扩大鼓吹“台湾分离运动”，同时美国新闻处长卡度也在台湾放出所谓“对日和约未缔结以前，台湾的归属尚未正式确定”的空气。卡度声称：“现在台湾是在麦克阿瑟管辖之下”，“台湾人如愿意脱离中国的统治，美国可以帮忙。”（见一九四七年十月十五日香港“华商报”台北通讯），一九四八年，在美国当局的指使之下，以美国走狗廖文毅为主席的“台湾独立联盟”及其他御用团体，又相继发表要求美国帮助“台湾独立”的宣言。同年九月，美国在台湾的特务机关，并伪造了各御用团体签署的请愿书，提交麦克阿瑟总部，正式提出“要求联合国派兵占领台湾”。（见一九四八年九月二十二日合众社东京电）因为，当时中国人民解放军已在中国大陆取得基本的胜利，国民党政府业已崩溃，而台湾人民又十分恼怒蒋介石的暴政，所以美国当局急于施展其政治阴谋的试探活动，企图由此寻找一种口实，借以造成美国直接独占台湾的基础。
    （三）
    一九四九年，随着蒋介石军队在中国大陆的覆灭，作为国民党残余匪帮最后巢穴的台湾，就愈益为美国侵略者所重视。麦克阿瑟曾公开声称：台湾是“向南侵略的跳板”，它是“自日本经冲绳及菲律宾伸展到东南亚的运输及交通连锁线上的主要环节”，假如台湾被我解放，“则美国前线地位的中心及南翼的战略重要性，将被抵消或整个被淹没”。（见本年八月二十八日麦克阿瑟给美国海外作战退役军人协会大会的演词。）正因为台湾在美国的侵略总计划中，占有如此重要的“战略价值”，所以美国在中国大陆解放以后，虽然由杜鲁门于本年一月五日发表了“不干涉台湾”的虚伪声明，但实际上，却是更积极更加紧地继续支持麇集台湾的国民党残余匪帮，阻止我中华人民共和国解放台湾，并图谋使台湾彻底变为美国直接控制下的太平洋战略基地。为此，在一九四九年十一月，美国与台湾国民党反动残余集团，曾缔结了一个军事秘密协定，该协定规定：美国继续供给国民党五个师的武器和设备，十六只军舰以及雷达装置和飞机零件等，此外，美国又允许拨付九千万元的援匪剩余款项，并将美国国会通过的所谓：“用于中国一般地区”的七千五百万美元的拨款，交给台湾残匪使用。国民党残余集团方面，则答应下列条件：第一、按照美国的指示改组台湾残匪政府；第二、由美国政府派遣军事使团驻台并取得完全掌握台湾军事、政治和经济事务的权利。该协定规定如这样做还不能阻止人民解放军前进时，则以请联合国出面为名，由美帝直接下手占领台湾。
    这个时期，美国曾积极整顿窜逃到台湾的国民党残余武装，继续增加对蒋介石残匪的军事援助，并经过其军事使团监督台湾蒋匪对“美援”的运用，从而也进一步控制了台湾。在空军方面，据美联社报道，一九四九年十一月曾有一○○架重型轰炸机从加利佛尼亚经关岛运往台湾。一九五○年三月，又有二十五架飞机运台。美国在日本的当局并为蒋匪积极招募日本空军人员，参与轰炸中国大陆的破坏活动。同时，美国海军部于一九四九年十二月二十九日宣布派出一艘二万七千吨的拳士号航空母舰和二艘驱逐舰至亚洲海面，以扩大准备侵略台湾的美国第七特种舰队。当时，美国海军曾宣称：“第七特种舰队构成一个流动的力量，随时准备用来支持美国的国策，并且作为西太平洋的一个稳定性的力量。”这个措施，乃是美国为后来公开武装干涉台湾所准备好的一个预定步骤与此互相配合的，美国除于一九四九年把在中国大陆的“联合军事顾问团”由巴大维率领退到台湾外，又陆续派遣军事顾问及专家到台湾，借以加强对残匪各机构的控制，并策划台湾残匪继续与中国人民作战的军事部署。据美国报纸所公布的材料，截至一九五○年一月为止，“已有一百多名美国所谓‘退休’军官送到台湾。在美国军事顾问的直接指挥下，美帝及其走狗国民党积极采取了强化台湾海空军基地的措施。大批运往台湾的军备物资，也迅速被用以装备国民党残余武装及新训练的部队。据美国通讯社的报道，一九五○年二月，美国坦克及军用卡车各一百辆，经由菲律宾运抵台湾（注十），三月份又有一百辆坦克运台。国民党残余匪帮并经由纽约国际商业公司向美国购买了各种军用物资（注十一）。此外，杜鲁门并已批准麦克阿瑟关于“以美、日陆海空军退役军人组织‘国际志愿军’援蒋守台”之建议。据六月四日纽约“星期指南针报”的报道，现已到达台湾的“国际志愿军”人员，有一百五十名的美国和日本的海空军将领，其中包括前日本侵华派遣军总司令而现任蒋介石总顾问的冈村宁次及根本博中将。从此之后，由美帝支持蒋匪招募的大批法西斯军人，便继续不断涌入台湾。一九四九年八月，日本海军人员二百余人分抵台湾之屏东、新竹，同年十月日本空军人员一千六百七十人，到达台湾之冈山，海军人员二千人到达台湾之新竹。同年十二月下旬，麦克阿瑟又派了日本顾问团十五人抵台北。现在，麦克阿瑟继续在日训练日本空军人员准备派赴台湾，参加国民党残余匪帮对中国人民的作战。关于美帝组织日军赴台湾助匪作战的事实，（⑵⑶）日本政府及东京的美国官员均是供认不讳的。一九四九年十月十二日，日本政府法务府总裁殖田，在答复众议院质询时，即曾供称：“若干‘志愿兵’实际上已赴台湾参加国民党军”。美国官方通讯社，同样也证实这一点。例如，同年十二月二日合众社东京电称：“一位占领当局高级官员说，前日本驻台湾的高级陆军军官正进行组织日本人的外国空军大队以为国民党作战的消息，是真实的”。
    更应引起注意的是美国对台湾所采取的军事措施“已不简单限于‘台湾’本岛的军事防御，而是把它作为美国太平洋战略总计划中的一个组成部分来加以部署的。一九四九年十一月，美国曾策动台湾蒋匪与美帝在朝鲜的李承晚傀儡政权商谈利用南朝鲜的空军基地轰炸中国大陆问题。同月，美远东空军司令斯特拉特梅耶中将及麦克阿瑟的副参谋长威洛贝少将，又与菲律宾联合参谋长在马尼拉举行太平洋防务会议，并商谈台湾问题。接着，于一九四九年十二月，美国驻菲律宾大使柯温，菲律宾总统季里诺及国民党匪帮大使陈质平于碧瑶举行“三角会议”，确定加强“台菲双方军事努力的联系”，“密切交换共同安全的情报”，并以菲律宾作为美国运军火援助台湾国民党残匪的转运站。而后，一九五○年二月在曼谷举行的美国远东外交人员会议，以及六月间美国防部长詹逊，参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷，国务院特别顾问杜勒斯在东京与麦克阿瑟的会谈中，均具体讨论了台湾问题。所有这一切活动，均明显地标志着美国已把台湾包括在其远东的整个侵略体系之中了。
    围绕着这个侵略的图谋，一九五○年二月十四日，美国总统在其所签署的“援华法案”中，决定将援华剩余款项一亿零四百万美元的动用期限，由二月十五日延长到六月三十日（见二月十五日美联社华盛顿电）。本年三月二十一日，美参院外委会更具体通过将上述一九四八年援华法案项下所未动用的剩余款项，拨付五千万美元援助国民党残匪，本年五月二十三日，美国国会又通过了明年度的“对外经济援助法案，该案确定从用于“中国一般地区”的七千五百万美元中，拨付四千万美元作为支持台湾蒋介石残匪之用（五月二十四日美联社华盛顿电）。此时，美国经合总署在台湾的活动亦显著加强起来。美国的枕木、汽油、军火、机器、零件等等，大批军用物资，陆续从美国运往台湾。据本年五月穆懿尔的报告，由美国运到台湾的每月进口物资，其价值每月平均为二二○万美元。此外，美国并加强了台湾与日本的贸易。据国民党驻日代表团商务处长邵逸周称：一九四九年台湾对日输出贸易总额达三千万美元。麦克阿瑟总部，则命令日本运送大批军用金属、军用装备及海船援助台湾国民党残余匪帮。这是美国援蒋计划中的一部分，同时也更逼使台湾成为美国独占下的日本经济体系的一个附庸。
    正因为美国对台湾的野心，是如此狂妄，所以当美国侵略者面对着中国人民取得伟大胜利并将继续解放台湾的新形势时，就引起了深刻的惶恐与慌张，从而，美国当局急于寻找一个机会，及制造各种借口，把它长期渗透侵略所造成的既成事实，公开宣布为“合法的”占领。为此，早在一九四九年三月，麦克阿瑟便公开叫喊：“在日本和约签订以前，台湾仍属于盟军”。随后，美国务卿艾奇逊亦说：“台湾虽已加到中国的领土上，但在技术上讲，在对日和约签订前，台湾仍是日本的领土。”接着，美国国防部长詹逊与参谋会议主席布莱德雷，于六月间前往东京和麦克阿瑟商谈侵占台湾的新部署。据六月二十日合众社东京记者的报导，詹逊与布莱德雷由东京会商回美国后，曾向杜鲁门提出支持国民党残匪阻挠台湾解放的计划，六月二十五日纽约先锋论坛报，则更具体地透露了这个计划的内容，该报宣称：“总部官员坚信：如果根据下面的方针采取迅速行动的话，共产党人可能甚至不敢发动对台湾的攻击，美国应该发表一个措辞强硬的公开声明说明对于前属日本的台湾岛的最后处置问题，必须等待对日和约的签订，在和约签订前，台湾将由美国或联合国代管。与发表这一声明同时，应该派遣一个大规模的军事代表团，并应该将海军实力炫示一番。”果然不出二天时间，美国政府在指使李承晚集团挑起朝鲜战争之后，杜鲁门便于六月二十七日发表声明，公开宣布美国政府决定以武力直接侵占台湾。由此可见，美国武装干涉台湾的计划，在杜鲁门总统公开宣布以前，实际上就早已确定了。六月二十三日艾奇逊之重申杜鲁门一月五日声明的仍然有效，不过是掩盖这一阴谋的烟幕而已。
    （四）
    一九五○年六月二十七日，杜鲁门声明的发表，表明了：美国对台湾的政策，已由长期渗透的侵略，发展到公开直接武装占领的阶段。这是美国历来侵略台湾阴谋的必然结果，也是美国扩大远东战争的一个严重步骤。
    杜鲁门宣布了这个武装侵占台湾的总方针之后，又命令美国远东军总司令麦克阿瑟到台湾与蒋介石密商侵占台湾的具体步骤。七月三十一日，麦氏同其参谋长阿尔孟德少将，远东海军司令卓伊中将，第七舰队司令史枢特中将，远东空军司令斯特拉特梅耶中将，在国民党残匪驻日军事代表团长何世礼陪同下由东京抵台北。麦蒋会商决定：美台双方海、陆、空军，归麦克阿瑟统一指挥，以“共同防守”台湾。美国除第七舰队外，增派第十三航空队，常驻台湾，并在台设立：“军事联络办事处”。又规定：“美军可自由使用台湾空军基地”，“台湾海陆空军所需之军火、弹药、汽油、军需物资及一切作战武器，由美国远东军总部予以补充”。很显然的，这是美国利用蒋匪人力、物力确保其在台湾的武装占领，以准备进攻中华人民共和国的具体步骤。这一个军事阴谋，不仅曾为美国合众社记者所透露，并也为麦克阿瑟与蒋介石在同一天联合发表的公报所证实。麦克阿瑟于八月一日离台返日时，曾公开宣称：“余统率下之美军与中国政府（按即指台湾国民党反动政府）军队间之有效联系，业已完成”。麦氏并表示，对台湾执行武装干涉的政策，是他的“责任和坚决的目的”。同日，蒋介石亦声称：“过去二日内，吾人与麦帅举行之历次会议中，对于有关各项问题，已获得一致之意见。其间关于共同保卫台湾与中美军事合作之基础，已告奠定”（中央社台北八月一日电）。这一事实的发展，表明美国不仅已武装侵占了台湾，并且决定由麦克阿瑟统一指挥美蒋联合的武装部队，来破坏我中华人民共和国解放台湾之合法行动了。这显然是美国政府敌视中国人民的一种战争挑畔，是公开武装侵略中国的狂妄行动。
    从此，美国侵略台湾的各种活动，便越加紧张与露骨起来。奉命侵占台湾的美国十三航空队及第七舰队，已于六月底开到台湾，并在我领海领空及其边缘实行巡逻与侦察活动。据纽约先驱论坛报记者七月二十四日自台北报道，该美国舰队侵入我领海进行巡逻活动的范围，南起广东汕头的海面，北至山东青岛港外，为一条长达一千英里的海岸线。美国为统一指挥在台湾的海空军，麦克阿瑟曾命其副参谋长福克斯带领军事使团于八月四日到达台湾。这个军事使团，开始叫做“麦克阿瑟总部驻台军事联络组”，后来又改为“美国远东军驻台考察团”。十月三日，美国政府曾放出骗人的烟幕，说是要把这个“考察团”召回日本。但实际上，美国的军事指挥人员，依然在台湾国防总部与国民党残匪合署办公，共同策划阻挡我国解放台湾的作战军事部署。
    与美国对台湾展开直接武装侵略活动同时，美帝对台湾的经济侵略活动亦有新的发展。首先，美国经合总署通过从七月起的三个月援台方案中，决定着重“加强台湾的战争工业潜在力”。十月六日穆懿尔在其向经合总署所提出的报告书中，亦曾供称：美国已协助台湾“对其有限资源作最有效的使用”，“台湾工业计划主要集中于铁路、公路、港口、电力、矿业和森林的发展”，经合总署则“供给台湾的电力系统、铁路、公路、电讯及交通系统所必需的设备和补充条件”。该报告书并指出自七月份起，美经合总署供应台湾的物资，由以往的每月平均价值二百二十万美元，增加到每月平均三百三十万美元。另据九月二十二日美新闻处的报道，经合总署援助台湾国民党残匪的款项，累计已达一亿八千三百六十二万八千美元。其次，美国并进一步控制台湾的财政收支。据国民党官方通讯社的报道，在八月一日麦克阿瑟总部马奎特少将与台湾财政部长严家淦，台省主席吴国桢，财政厅长任显群，及美援运用委员会秘书长王崇植商讨台湾财经问题之后，麦克阿瑟总部曾派遣财政专家摩斯到台湾调查国民党残匪的财政状况，而后又派税务专家去调查台湾的税务情形。其三，美国命令其控制下的日本与台湾于九月六日正式签订贸易协定，该协定规定：自今年七月一日至明年六月三十一日止，台湾对日出口价值五千万美元的货物，日本亦以五千万美元的货物输往台湾。（详见国民党中央社东京九月六日电）这将使台湾彻底服务于美国控制下的以日本为中心的远东侵略集团的经济体系，以便为侵略战争的需要，而组织其经济力量。
    最后，也是最值得注意的，是美国正在加紧进行利用联合国的名义，企图在“和平解决台湾问题”的幌子之下，实现其并吞台湾的阴谋。这从近来杜鲁门及艾奇逊、奥斯汀的言论中，就可以看得非常明白。他们说：“台湾未来地位，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑”。美国代表团向联合国大会提出所谓“福摩萨未来地位”问题，就是实现这个阴谋的一个具体步骤。美国企图制造出根本不存在的“台湾地位”问题，借以转移人们对我国抗议美国侵略的注意，并图使联合国对于控诉武装侵略台湾案的处理，达到有利于美国的侵略目的。不久之前，美国务院官员，曾于九月一日在华盛顿记者招待会上表示：“美国政策的目的，在于通过联合国和日本和约的谈判，找出和平解决台湾问题的办法”。但同时他又声称：“虽然国务院计划在朝鲜战争以后，将第七舰队自台湾海峡调开，但在台湾附近的地区内，将保持强大的陆海军”，并谓：“美国驻太平洋的军队将有准备以便在必要时迅速返回台湾海面”（合众社华盛顿九月一日电）。美国务院官员的这一篇话，正道出了问题的真相。这就是说，美国侵占台湾的形式，可能采取各种花样，但其武装侵占台湾的实质，则是无论如何不会变更的。
    （五）
    由此可见，美国海空军之侵入台湾，显然是对于中国领土最公开露骨的侵略。这一狂妄的非法行为，绝不是如杜鲁门所诡辩的什么由于朝鲜战争所引起的“临时措施”，而实是美国长期侵略的阴谋。美国武装侵占台湾这一行动，与其发动侵略朝鲜的战争及武装干涉越南，同是为了包围中华人民共和国，进一步侵略中国大陆及亚洲各国，而有计划采取的一种严重的军事侵略步骤。十一月二十八日，美国代表杜勒斯，曾在安理会上辩解美国在台湾只有“四十四个”军事人员，他企图以这个虚假的说法来证明美国并没有侵略台湾。但事实是，美在台湾不仅有其军事指挥部，并且有它的空军第十三航空队，有它的海军第七舰队，并控制着全台湾的海空军基地。这些难道不正是美国武装侵占台湾的铁证吗？这个铁一般的历史事实，无论美国怎样辩解，也是掩盖不了的。
    美国武装干涉台湾的侵略行动，显然也不是如杜鲁门所诡辩的是为了使朝鲜战争“局部化”，而正是扩大了朝鲜战争，是有计划地把侵略朝鲜的战火，燃烧到我伟大祖国的领土。事实上，由于美国积极武装日本，由于美国侵占朝鲜和台湾，由于美国武装干涉越南及其他东南亚各地。太平洋上的安全与和平已被破坏了，远东战争扩大化的危机正在增长。美国侵略朝鲜的军队，悍然越过三八线，进逼我东北边境，美国侵朝军队的飞机，不顾我国的一再抗议，竟然由轰炸我东北鸭绿江沿岸城乡，而扩大到侵入我东北内地的本溪及辽阳上空。这显然都是美帝扩大侵略战争的具体步骤。美国总统杜鲁门及国务卿艾奇逊，不是曾说侵占台湾是为保障“联合国阵地左翼”安全的“军事中立行动”吗？十一月二十八日安理会讨论控美侵台案时，美国代表杜勒斯又重复了这个老调。但试问：为了保护所谓“联合国阵地”的其他各翼，如右翼，如左翼之左翼，左翼之右翼等的安全，或其前后方的安全，不是更要扩大它的侵略地区吗？这当然是同美国在所谓维持“美国国防的安全”的借口之下，而要到全世界各地建立它的海空军基地，并派遣他的海陆空军，去侵犯他国的领土主权的言论行动，是属于同一逻辑的。这就是美国帝国主义的世界扩张政策，世界战争政策的真相，其目的显然不是为了要把战争“局部化”，而是要把它扩大化。不是为了维护和平，而是为了扩大战争！
    美国这种疯狂的侵略战争政策，已在中国及亚洲人民中引起了新的愤怒，同时也引起全世界爱好和平人民的反对。我中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民，已从美国历来的侵略罪行中，得到了深刻的教训。美国侵略者的任何花样，都欺骗不了中国人民。我中华人民共和国政府及全国人民不仅有解放台湾的坚决意志，而且也具备充足的力量去保卫祖国领土的统一与主权的完整。中华人民共和国的神圣领土是不容侵犯的，如果美国政府顽固地不把侵略军队自台湾撤退，那中国将会采取必要的行动，把美国侵略者赶出台湾。中国人民志愿部队，亦必将继续支援朝鲜人民军击败美国侵略者。美国政府必须对自己疯狂侵略行为所引起的后果，负其应有的责任。
