Editor's Note: The color documentary "Liberated China" is a giant film jointly produced by Beijing Film Studio of China and Gorky Film Studio of Moscow, USSR. The director is Comrade Gerasimov. After the film was completed, a grand celebration meeting was held at the Youth Palace on October 4th. Premier Zhou Enlai attended the meeting and delivered a speech, and presented Comrade Gerasimov with an honorary certificate on behalf of the Central People's Government. The film will be screened simultaneously in fifteen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an and Dihua from December 30th to welcome the victorious New Year of 1951.

        Gentlemen, Comrades:
    The color documentary "Liberated China," jointly produced by the Beijing Film Studio and the Moscow Gorky Film Studio, has been successfully produced after a year of efforts by Soviet and Chinese comrades and will be screened simultaneously in our country and the Soviet Union. For the success of this film, the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has decided to award a certificate to its director, Soviet People's Artist Comrade Gerasimov. On behalf of the Central People's Government, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Comrade Gerasimov and all the Chinese and Soviet staff who participated in this work.

    This film briefly records the history of the Chinese people's liberation struggle and vividly reflects all aspects of economic and cultural life in China after liberation. It contains many valuable historical materials and beautiful artistic pictures. The past suffering, today's joy, and future hope of our people are excellently portrayed in this film.

    For many years, imperialism has not only invaded us, but also slandered us in the world by various means, distorting the Chinese people as a very backward nation. This film, like "The Victory of the Chinese People," which is now being screened nationwide, powerfully strikes at the shameless lies of the imperialists. It will help the world to correctly understand China. Therefore, this film is an important contribution to strengthening the world's peace and democracy camp and developing international friendship between China and the people of all countries.

    Like "The Victory of the Chinese People," we must first thank the Chinese people's dearest friend, the great Comrade Stalin, for the production of this film. It was he who proposed the shooting of these two films and sent excellent Soviet artists to China to carry out the shooting work. Chinese and Soviet filmmakers traveled all over China, from east to west and south to north, to shoot these two films, and jointly overcame many difficulties. Later, thanks to the efforts of many production staff at the Soviet Film Studio, these two color films were produced. Therefore, these two films can be said to be a symbol of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    Let us cheer: Long live the permanent and great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people! Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world!

    在庆祝《解放了的中国》摄制完成大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    编者按：五彩纪录片《解放了的中国》，是我国北京电影制片厂和苏联莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂联合摄制的巨片。编导者是格拉西莫夫同志。该片全部摄制完成后，曾于十月四日在青年宫举行隆重的庆祝大会，周恩来总理亲临讲话，并代表中央人民政府授予格拉西莫夫同志以荣誉奖状。该片将于本月三十日起在京、津、沪、宁、杭、汉、沈、大连、哈、张、济、穗、渝、西安、迪化等十五个城市同时放映，以迎接一九五一年的胜利新年。
          各位先生，各位同志：
    北京电影制片厂和莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂合制的五彩艺术纪录影片《解放了的中国》，经过苏联同志和中国同志一年的努力，已经摄制成功，即将在我国和苏联各地同时上演。为了这部影片的成功，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院决定向它的导演、苏联人民艺术家格拉西莫夫同志授予奖状。我现在代表中央人民政府首先向格拉西莫夫同志和参加这一工作的中苏两国全体工作人员表示深切的谢意。
    这部影片，扼要地纪录了中国人民解放斗争的历史，生动地反映了中国解放后经济和文化生活的各方面，其中包含很多珍贵的历史材料，和优美的艺术画面。我国人民过去的痛苦，今天的欢乐，将来的希望，在这影片里，有很出色的描写。
    多少年来，帝国主义一面侵略我们，一面在世界上用种种方法污蔑我们，把中国人民歪曲地描写成为非常落后的民族。这部片子，和现在已经在全国上演的《中国人民的胜利》一样，有力地打击了帝国主义者无耻的谰言。它将帮助全世界正确地认识中国。因此，这部影片对于加强世界和平民主阵营，发展中国和各国人民的国际友谊是一个重要的贡献。
    也和《中国人民的胜利》一样，对于这部影片的摄制，我们首先要感谢中国人民最亲切的朋友，伟大的斯大林同志。是他提议拍摄这两部影片，并且派遣了苏联优秀的艺术家来到中国进行摄制的工作。中苏两国的电影工作者，为了摄制这两部影片，曾经共同跑遍了中国的东西南北，共同克服了许多艰难困苦。以后又由苏联电影制片厂许多制片工作人员的努力，这两部五彩影片才得以产生。因此，这两部片子可以说是中苏两国人民伟大友谊的象征。
    让我们欢呼：中苏两大国家的永久的伟大的友谊万岁！中国人民领袖毛泽东同志万岁！世界劳动人民领袖斯大林同志万岁！
