    (I) Strive for Peace with Positive Action!
    The Central People's Government Committee has passed a resolution to accept the proposal for the Second World Peace Congress and calls on the people of the whole country to work together to promote its realization. This represents the firm will and ardent desire of the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, to defend world peace.
    The declaration to the people of the world and the letter to the United Nations issued by the Second World Peace Congress represent the common determination of the people of eighty countries in the world to strive for peace and oppose aggression. The Chinese people, who love peace and are engaged in a heroic struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country through voluntary action to strive for peace, have proved with practical actions that they are the most determined to support the struggle program and great call of the Second World Peace Congress; the Chinese people must also fight resolutely to the end to realize the ten goals stipulated in the declaration and the letter to the United Nations of the World Peace Congress.
    Based on their own experience, the Chinese people most profoundly understand the truth that "peace must not be waited for, but must be striven for." When U.S. imperialism and its running dog in China, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, threatened the Chinese people with war and forced the Chinese people to accept war, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people in an indomitable and heroic struggle, and finally eliminated the enemy who dared to launch war and liberated our great motherland. Similarly, when U.S. imperialism directly invaded Korea and at the same time invaded China, threatening the people of Asia and the world with war, the Chinese people took voluntary action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and finally inflicted a decisive defeat on the invading troops of U.S. imperialism. Facts constantly prove that the imperialists are war-loving beasts. In the face of such beasts, peace can never be obtained through prayer and entreaty; nor can peace be obtained by passively avoiding war. Only when the strength of the people is united, wielding our giant fists of the people like steel, and giving the beasts in front of us a head-on blow, can we repel aggression and strive for peace. Facts have proved that war can be avoided and peace can be striven for. "Anyone who stubbornly says 'war is inevitable' is slandering all mankind." Is our existing experience not enough to illustrate this point?
    Because we have this experience, we are even more convinced that the current struggle to defend world peace is inextricably linked to the opposition to U.S. aggression. U.S. imperialism is the culprit for creating war and destroying peace. The people of the world should relentlessly condemn all the crimes of U.S. imperialism; and they should universally smash all the evil measures taken by U.S. imperialism for the purpose of war at any time and any place, so that all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism will fail in every corner of the world. This will greatly help the just cause of the world's people in striving for and defending world peace. Although U.S. imperialism's aggression against Asia has suffered a decisive blow, the danger of a new war has not been completely overcome. Therefore, we Chinese people must further unite and fight with the people of the world, and strive to expand and consolidate the united front of the world's people fighting for peace with the World Peace Council as the center, and resolutely implement the ten proposals of the Second World Peace Congress.
    Our people resolutely demand that the United Nations, in accordance with the path pointed out in the letter from the World Peace Congress to the United Nations, return to the principles prescribed by the people of the world and on which it was founded. The people of the world can no longer allow the United Nations to continue to suffer from U.S. manipulation and destruction. We will never believe that the United Nations, without the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, can possess the legitimacy it should have. We have the right to deny the illegal resolutions of the United Nations, and therefore its illegal resolutions cannot take effect. In particular, the Chinese people can never accept the illegal resolutions passed by the United Nations on all Eastern issues closely related to China in the absence of our legal representatives and without the consent of our government. In order to discuss and peacefully resolve the current major international issues, our people fully support the proposal of the Second World Peace Congress to convene a five-power conference of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France as soon as possible in order to restore peace in Asia and strive for and defend world peace.
    Our people firmly believe that with the World Peace Council elected by the Second World Peace Congress shouldering the lofty task of defending lasting world peace, the peace-loving people of the world will unite more firmly. Hundreds of millions of men and women in countries around the world will launch a more active and selfless struggle for peace. In the past, under the call of the World Peace Congress, our people not only had more than 200 million people solemnly sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal; but also, when U.S. imperialism extended its aggressive bloody hands to Korea and our country, we have already put into practice our sacred oath to defend peace through voluntary action; in the future, we will follow the direction pointed out by the World Peace Congress, support and assist our Central People's Government, and bravely contribute everything to the realization of its resolutions.
    Let us repeat the last sentence of the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress: "Let the governments of all countries act in the same way, then the cause of peace can be saved."

### （一）以积极行动争取和平！

    （一）以积极行动争取和平！
    中央人民政府委员会通过了接受二届世界和大和平建议的决议，号召全国人民一致努力促其实现。这是代表着占世界人口四分之一的中国人民保卫世界和平的坚强意志和热烈愿望。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会所发出的告全世界人民的宣言及致联合国书，代表着世界上八十个国家的人民争取和平反对侵略的共同决心。热爱和平并为争取和平而以志愿行动实行抗美援朝保家卫国的英勇斗争的中国人民，已经用实际行动证明了自己是最坚决拥护二届世界和大的斗争纲领和伟大号召的；中国人民还一定要为实现世界和大的宣言及致联合国书上所规定的十项目标而坚决斗争到底。
    中国人民根据自己亲身的经验，最深刻地懂得“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”的真理。当着美帝国主义及其在中国的走狗蒋介石匪帮，用战争来威胁中国人民并且强迫中国人民接受战争的时候，中国共产党领导了中国人民，进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争，终于消灭了敢于发动战争的敌人，解放了我们伟大的祖国。同样，当着美帝国主义直接侵略朝鲜，同时侵略中国，用战争来威胁全亚洲和全世界人民的时候，中国人民就以志愿行动来抗美援朝保家卫国，终于使美帝国主义的侵略军队遭到了决定性的失败。事实不断地证明，帝国主义者是酷嗜战争的野兽。在这样的野兽面前，决不是用祈祷和哀求能够得到和平的；也不是消极地躲避战争能够得到和平的。只有人民的力量团结起来，挥动我们像钢铁一般的人民的巨拳，给予我们当面的野兽以迎头痛击，才能打退侵略，争取和平。事实证明战争是可以避免的，和平是可以争取的。“凡是硬说‘战争不可避免’的人，都是在诽谤全人类。”我们已有的经验，难道还不足以说明这个问题吗？
    由于我们有了这个经验，就使我们更加确信目前保卫世界和平的斗争与反对美国的侵略具有不可分割的关系。美帝国主义是制造战争破坏和平的罪魁。世界人民对于美帝国主义的一切罪行，应该毫不容情地加以谴责；并且应该随时随地对于美帝国主义为了战争的目的所进行的一切罪恶措施，普遍予以粉碎性的打击，使美帝国主义的一切阴谋在世界的任何角落都归于失败。这将大大帮助了世界人民争取与保卫世界和平的正义事业。现在美帝国主义对亚洲的侵略，虽然已经遭受了决定性的打击，但是新战争的危险还没有被彻底克服下去。因此，我们中国人民还必须和全世界人民进一步团结奋斗，努力扩大与巩固以世界保卫和平委员会为中心的世界人民为和平而斗争的统一战线，坚决实现二届和大的十项建议。
    我国人民坚决要求联合国按照世界和大致联合国书所指出的道路，回到世界人民所规定的和它所赖以建立的原则上去。世界人民已经不能容许联合国继续遭受美国的操纵与破坏了。我们决不相信，没有占世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国代表参加的联合国，能够具备它所应有的合法性。我们有权否认联合国的非法决议，因而它的非法决议也是不能生效的。特别是对于一切与中国有密切关系的东方问题，联合国在没有我国合法代表出席和没有获得我国政府同意的情形下所通过的非法决议，中国人民决不能予以接受。为了讨论与和平解决当前国际的重大问题，我国人民完全拥护二届世界和大的建议，要求尽速召集由中华人民共和国、苏联及美、英、法参加的五大国会议，以便恢复亚洲的和平，争取与保卫世界的和平。
    我国人民坚定地相信，有了二届世界和大所选出的世界保卫和平委员会来肩负保卫世界持久和平的崇高任务，全世界爱好和平的人民，将更加巩固地团结起来。世界各国亿万男女将为争取和平而展开更积极的忘我的斗争。我国人民过去在世界和大的号召之下，不但有了二万万人以上尊严地签名于斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言上；而且在美帝国主义向朝鲜和我国伸出侵略血手的时候，我们又已经以志愿行动实践了我们保卫和平的神圣誓言；今后我们更将按照世界和大所指出的方向，拥护与协助我国中央人民政府，勇敢地为实现它的决议而贡献一切。
    让我们重复二届和大宣言的最后一句话：“让各国政府同样地行动起来，那末，和平事业就可以得救。”
