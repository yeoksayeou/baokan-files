    Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission jointly issued instructions on December 22nd regarding launching a movement to support the government, cherish the people, support the army, and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the New Year and Spring Festival. The full text is as follows:
    (1) During the 1951 New Year and Spring Festival, a movement to support the government, cherish the people, support the army, and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers should be launched among all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and among staff at all levels of local government and the broad masses of the people. At present, the American imperialists are frantically undermining world peace, invading our territory of Taiwan and our neighbor Korea, seriously threatening the security of our motherland. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously enhance the patriotic and internationalist thinking of the people of the whole country and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, consolidate and improve the army's fighting will to love the motherland, love the people, and defend peace in East Asia and the world, and enhance the people's enthusiastic sentiment of supporting and assisting the army. The close unity of our 475 million people and 5 million People's Liberation Army will inflict severe blows on any invaders and provide a strong guarantee for the security and peaceful construction of our motherland.
    (2) In order to make the movement to support the government, cherish the people, support the army, and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers universally launched and closely integrated with the current tasks, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth education in the troops and in local governments at all levels and among the masses of the people. In the troops, all commanders and fighters must be educated to realize that the People's Liberation Army is a major component of the country and a major guarantee for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Our country, our government, and the government's policies and decrees are the fruits of our heroic fighting, bloodshed, and sacrifice. Therefore, all commanders and fighters of the army should not only become models of abiding by laws and regulations and implementing government orders, but also infinitely love their motherland and become staunch defenders of the fruits of revolutionary victory and economic and cultural construction. At the same time, it should also be recognized that the people's army must maintain close ties with the masses and protect the interests of the people at all times. Without the active support of the people, today's victory would not have been possible, and it would be impossible to consolidate national defense and win the victory in the anti-aggression struggle. Therefore, all arrogant and complacent ideas of resting on one's laurels and all peaceful thoughts of losing the concept of a fighting team must be corrected. All violations of mass discipline and some serious phenomena of infringing on the interests of the people must be seriously examined and dealt with. Among government cadres and the masses of the people, it should be recognized that the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution is mainly the result of the heroic fighting and bloodshed sacrifices of the People's Liberation Army. In order to resist aggression and protect the people, they are still standing on the front line of national defense today. To love the People's Liberation Army is to love the motherland and to consolidate and enhance the strength to defend national economic construction. Since the liberation of the whole country, some local cadres and the masses, under the influence of peaceful thoughts, have had insufficient understanding of the importance of consolidating and building a strong national defense force, and have relaxed or neglected the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and even despised military personnel. Serious deviations must be resolutely corrected and overcome.
    (3) Government inspection of the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and the work of returning to the team, and the troops' inspection of mass discipline and the examination of studying and implementing government laws and regulations, should be taken as the main content of carrying out this movement.
    The inspections by governments at all levels should mainly focus on organizing the production and work of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. It is necessary to understand their production, family building, and employment, help them solve the current difficulties in their lives, and ensure that the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents can maintain the living standards of the local people, and that disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers can make a living and establish a career, and that everyone can be in their proper place. In rural areas, inspecting the work of land tilling on behalf of military families and helping military families with farm work should be given top priority. The results of the inspection must be well summarized. Problems must be solved in a timely manner, and the masses must be mobilized to study more practical methods according to local conditions, make future plans, and lay the foundation for next year. The people's governments of all provinces should make new and strict regulations on the work of returning to the team according to the new situation, and vigorously carry them out to consolidate the fighting strength of our army. In combat and bandit suppression areas, in addition to the above inspections, we should also do a good job in supporting the front, such as transportation, stretcher bearing, and cooperation in combat, and provide good comfort to the wounded and sick soldiers.
    The troops' mass discipline inspection also requires widespread and in-depth examination. For those who have borrowed houses and furniture from the masses for a long time, propaganda and explanation should be carried out, expressing apologies and gratitude, and helping with labor as remuneration. Damage to property should be compensated. For major incidents of violating laws and disciplines and infringing on the interests of the masses, in addition to compensation and apologies, the parties concerned should also be given necessary punishment and announced to the masses. Troops stationed in newly liberated areas and ethnic minority areas should strictly abide by mass discipline and use practical actions to dispel their misunderstandings and concerns. All combat or bandit suppression troops should send people to the battlefield to conduct mass discipline inspections, and send capable cadres to lead the work of militia and laborers, help them invigorate their political, cultural, and entertainment lives, and properly take care of their food and accommodation. Meetings should be held to welcome and send off the militia and laborers. Those who have made meritorious service should be awarded flags and merits. The wounded and dead should be properly treated and given pensions. A portion of the captured items should be distributed to them to encourage their enthusiasm.
    (4) In all garrison areas, military-civilian get-togethers can be held through various activities such as military-civilian symposiums, New Year's group visits, and joint evening parties to expand the propaganda against the United States and aiding Korea and boost the confidence of the military and civilians in winning the victory against imperialism. In particular, troops stationed in ethnic minority areas must thoroughly study and publicize the provisions of the Common Program on ethnic policies, respect their customs and habits, and cadres at all levels of the troops should extend New Year greetings to their leaders and progressive people.
    (5) The people's governments and troops at all levels must specifically implement the above sections according to local conditions. After the movement is over, a summary report should be made level by level to the higher level.

    内务部暨军委总政治部联合号召
    展开新年拥政爱民拥军优属运动
    【新华社二十三日讯】中央人民政府内务部、人民革命军事委员会总政治部于二十二日联合发出关于新旧年关开展拥政爱民和拥军优属运动的指示。全文如下：
    （一）在一九五一年新年和春节之际，应在人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员中和各级地方政府的工作人员和广大人民群众中分别开展拥政爱民和拥军优属运动。现在美帝国主义者正疯狂地破坏世界和平，侵略我国领土台湾和我国邻邦朝鲜，严重地威胁祖国的安全。因此，必须不断地提高全国人民和人民解放军全体指战员的爱国主义思想与国际主义思想，巩固与提高军队爱祖国、爱人民及保卫东亚与世界和平的战斗意志，提高人民拥护与支援军队的热烈情绪。我国四万七千五百万人民和五百万人民解放军的亲密团结，将给任何进犯者以严重的痛击，并使我们祖国的安全与和平建设，得到强有力的保证。
    （二）为了使拥政爱民和拥军优属运动普遍开展，并使之与当前任务紧密结合，必须在部队中及各级地方政府和人民群众中进行广泛深入的教育。在部队中，要教育全体指战员认识：人民解放军是国家的主要组成部分，是巩固人民民主专政的主要保证，我们的国家、我们的政府、政府的政策法令，都是我们英勇作战、流血牺牲的斗争果实。因此，全军指战员，不仅应当成为遵法守纪和推行政令的模范，而且应当无限地热爱自己的祖国，成为革命胜利果实与经济、文化建设的坚强捍卫者；同时，又应当认识：人民的军队，无论在任何时候，都必须密切地联系群众，保护人民的利益，如果离开了人民的积极支援，那么今天的胜利就是不可能的，巩固国防、争取反侵略斗争的胜利也是不可能的。因此，一切骄傲自大的居功思想和丧失战斗队观念的太平思想都必须加以纠正。一切违背群众纪律、以及某些严重侵犯人民利益的现象，必须认真地加以检查和处置。在政府干部及人民群众中，应认识中国人民民主革命的胜利，主要是人民解放军英勇战斗和流血牺牲的结果，为了反抗侵略、保护人民，他们今天仍然站在国防最前线。热爱人民解放军，就是热爱祖国，就是巩固与提高了保卫国家经济建设的力量。自全国解放以来，有些地方干部和群众，在太平思想影响下，对巩固与建设强大国防力量的重要性认识不足，发生放松或忽视拥军优属工作，甚至发生轻视军队人员等，严重偏向必须加以坚决的纠正和克服。
    （三）政府检查拥军优属工作和归队工作，部队检查群众纪律和检查学习与执行政府法令的状况，应作为开展这一运动的主要内容。
    各级政府的检查，主要应放在组织烈、军属和残废军人、复员军人的生产工作上，要了解他们生产建家和就业的情况，帮助他们解决目前生活上存在着的困难，务使烈、军属能维持当地一般人民的生活水平，残废军人、复员军人能够谋生立业，各得其所。而在农村，检查代耕和助耕工作，更应列为首要地位。检查结果必须很好总结。发现问题，必须及时解决，并发动群众根据当地情况，研究更切合实际的方法，作出今后计划，打下来年基础。各省人民政府应根据新的情况，对归队工作作新的严格的规定，并以大力进行，以巩固我军的战斗力量。在作战、剿匪地区，除进行以上检查外，还应作好运输、担架、配合作战等支前工作，并很好地慰劳伤病员。
    部队的群众纪律检查，同样要求普遍深入。凡长期借用群众房屋、家具者，应进行宣传解释，表示歉意和感谢，并以帮助劳动作为报酬。损物失物应当赔偿。凡对重大违犯法纪与侵害群众利益的事件，除赔偿道歉外，还应给当事人以必要的处分，并在群众中公布。在新解放区及少数民族地区驻防的部队，更要严格遵守群众纪律，以实际行动，消释其误解及顾虑。所有作战或剿匪部队，应派人到战地进行群众纪律的检查；并派得力干部领导民兵、民工工作，帮助他们活跃其政治、文化娱乐生活，妥善照顾其食宿。对民兵、民工的来去，应开会欢迎、欢送，立功者赠旗记功，伤亡者妥为治疗及抚恤，缴获品应酌量分给他们一部，以鼓励他们的情绪。
    （四）凡驻军地区，可通过军民座谈会、新年团拜、联欢晚会等各种活动举行军民联欢，扩大抗美援朝的宣传，鼓舞军民反帝的胜利信心。特别是驻在少数民族地区的部队，必须深入学习和宣传共同纲领中关于民族政策的规定，尊重他们的风俗习惯，部队各级干部应向他们的领袖人物和进步人士贺年。
    （五）对以上各节，各级人民政府和部队，必须根据当地情况具体贯彻执行。运动结束后，应分别逐级向上级作总结报告。
