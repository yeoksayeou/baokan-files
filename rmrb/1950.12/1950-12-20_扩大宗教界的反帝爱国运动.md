    Expanding the Patriotic Anti-Imperialist Movement in Religious Circles

    On December 13th, 20,000 members of church organizations, schools, hospitals, and students who had studied in the United States in Beijing held a patriotic demonstration to protest the American warmonger Austin's shameless slander against the Chinese people in the Security Council, and to expose the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out cultural aggression in China. This anti-imperialist and patriotic action by religious circles is welcome. This righteous action shows that patriotic people in religious circles have recognized the aggressive nature of American imperialism, taken a patriotic stand of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and country, and exposed the hideous face of American imperialism in carrying out aggression against the Chinese people. This movement should be expanded and implemented in religious circles throughout the country. We believe that patriotic people in churches everywhere will unanimously support and respond to the call of this anti-imperialist and patriotic action by religious circles in Beijing.

    The activities of Catholicism and Christianity in our country were initially manipulated and controlled by imperialist groups, especially the forces of British and American imperialism. In recent years, the influence of the American church has become paramount. They established many churches, schools, hospitals, and other cultural and relief institutions in China. The vast majority of these institutions are directly subsidized by foreign countries, and foreign missionaries occupy actual leading positions. Some church organizations were used by imperialism as agencies for espionage activities. There are many examples of imperialist-controlled churches carrying out conspiracies of aggression and sabotage in China. More remotely, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the intelligence activities of Father Vincent Lebbe (Belgian) of the French Catholic system and Bishop Megan (American) of the American system, who served as the bishop of the Xinxiang Diocese of the Catholic Church, in northern Shaanxi, southern Shanxi, and northwestern Henan, as well as the espionage cases in Xingtai, Qiqihar, Xianxian, and Shenyang that were continuously uncovered during the Liberation War. More recently, there was the case of the counter-revolutionary crimes of Wu Yage, a priest of the Zhengding Diocese, and others of the "Catholic Patriotic Group" who were executed in Shijiazhuang, and the behavior of American imperialist elements threatening Fu Jen Catholic University, interfering in the administration of Chinese schools, and infringing on the educational sovereignty of the Chinese people. Yet the warmonger Austin dared to describe these aggressive conspiracies that violated the interests of the Chinese people as "friendship" towards the Chinese people. The recent movement to denounce the crimes of American imperialism in church schools across the country, the symposiums and statements of people in the relief sector in the capital, and the anti-imperialist and patriotic demonstrations by 20,000 members of religious circles and students who had studied in the United States in Beijing are precisely an exposure of the aggressive face of American imperialism in China and a powerful response to Austin's slanderous ravings.

    The Chinese People's Government's religious policy is consistent and clear. Article 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the people have freedom of religious belief, that is, freedom to believe in religion and freedom to refuse to believe in religion, and both aspects of freedom are protected by law. However, while protecting freedom of religious belief, imperialism is never allowed to use religion to carry out activities that undermine and endanger the interests of our people. Opposing imperialist activities in churches is by no means opposing religion itself, nor is it narrow nationalism and xenophobia. This point should be clarified and should not be confused. True Christians and Catholics in China are first and foremost patriotic citizens. They should resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, love their motherland, support the political and social reforms carried out by the People's Government, and, together with the people of the whole country, use various voluntary actions to resist America and aid Korea to defend their homes and country and consolidate the victory of the Chinese people.

    China's church affairs should be run by the Chinese people themselves, and the forces of imperialism should be expelled from the Chinese church. China's cultural education and relief undertakings should be run by the Chinese government and people themselves, and imperialists should not be allowed to overstep their bounds. The Chinese people have stood up, and China is an independent and sovereign country, so it cannot allow the existence of colonial phenomena in which imperialism uses various religious and social undertakings to carry out aggression. The various tentacles of imperialism extended into China should be severed in order to effectively guarantee China's independence and sovereignty and safeguard the people's freedom and rights.

    The first group of more than 1,500 Chinese Christian figures jointly issued a declaration entitled "The Way for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China," calling on Christians across the country to sever the relationship between the church and imperialist countries and implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation to achieve the goal of reforming Chinese Christianity. This declaration stated the patriotic stance that Chinese Christians should have in the new China of opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and building a new democratic country. This declaration has been widely supported by the majority of responsible persons of Christians and church organizations throughout the country. As of December 7th, 26,727 Christians across the country had signed the reform declaration. This movement is still expanding. The Christians who have signed in various places have unanimously stated that they will resolutely sever the church's ties with imperialism and implement the policy of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. At the end of November, Wang Liangzuo (Chinese priest) and more than 500 Catholics in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan Administrative District, issued a "Declaration on the Self-Reliance and Reform Movement," resolutely stating that they would sever relations with imperialism in all aspects, implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, resist America and aid Korea with practical actions, and be determined to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China, and called on Catholics everywhere to warmly support and actively respond to this movement.

    The just struggle against imperialism's manipulation and control of the Chinese church has expanded among Chinese Christians and Catholics. Religious figures across the country should recognize the significance of the anti-imperialist and patriotic demonstration in Beijing's religious circles, expand and develop this movement, use their own actions to oppose Austin's shameless slander against the Chinese people, and expose the essence of American imperialism's crimes of aggression. Christians and Catholics should continue to expand the religious reform movement, especially patriotic Catholics in various places should support and respond to the self-reliance and reform movement initiated by more than 500 Catholics in Guangyuan County, completely sever the church's ties with imperialism, and gradually and completely realize the movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation in the church. We must resolutely oppose and expose the activities of imperialist elements using the church and other cultural and relief undertakings to carry out their aggressive conspiracies, and safeguard the autonomy of our people's religious, educational, and relief undertakings. That is to say, religious figures across the country should implement the spirit of the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and country into their own patriotic actions!

### 扩大宗教界的反帝爱国运动

    扩大宗教界的反帝爱国运动
    北京市教会团体、学校、医院及留美学生两万人，于十二月十三日举行了爱国示威大游行，抗议美国战贩奥斯汀在安理会所发表的诬蔑中国人民的无耻谰言，揭露美帝在中国进行文化侵略的罪行。宗教界的这一反帝爱国的行动，是值得欢迎的。这个正义的行动，表示了宗教界爱国人士已经认识了美帝国主义的侵略本质，站到抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国立场上，揭穿美帝对中国人民进行侵略的狰狞面目。这一运动是应该在全国各地宗教界中扩大与贯彻下去，我们相信各地教会中爱国的人士们将会一致支持与响应北京宗教界的这个反帝爱国行动的号召。
    我国天主教和基督教的活动，一开始就被帝国主义集团，特别是美英帝国主义势力所操纵与控制，近年来美国教会的势力更占了第一位。他们在中国办了许多教堂、学校、医院及其他文化、救济机关。这些机关绝大部分由外国直接津贴，并由外国教士占据实际领导地位。有些教会组织则被帝国主义作为进行间谍活动的机关。帝国主义控制下的教会在中国进行侵略破坏的阴谋活动的事例，稍远的如抗日战争期间，法国天主教系统的雷鸣远（比籍）和美国系统曾任天主教新乡教区主教的米甘（美籍），在陕北、晋南和豫西北的情报活动，及在解放战争中连续被破坏的邢台、齐齐哈尔、献县和沈阳的间谍案。最近如在石家庄处决的正定教区神父吴雅阁等“公教报国团”的反革命罪恶行动案件，和美帝国主义分子威胁辅仁大学，干涉中国学校行政，侵犯中国人民教育主权的行为。而战争贩子奥斯汀竟敢把这些违反中国人民利益的侵略阴谋活动说成是对中国人民的“友谊”。最近在各地教会学校中掀起的控诉美帝罪行运动，和首都救济界人士的座谈和声明，以及北京市宗教界和留美学生两万人的反帝爱国游行示威，就正是对美帝国主义在中国的侵略面目的揭露，对奥斯汀诬蔑狂言的有力回击。
    中国人民政府的宗教政策是一贯的和明确的。人民政协共同纲领第五条规定人民有宗教信仰的自由，即有信仰宗教的自由，也有拒绝信仰宗教的自由，这两方面的自由同受法律的保护。但保护宗教信仰自由，决不容许帝国主义利用宗教进行破坏与危害我国人民利益的活动。反对教会中的帝国主义活动，绝不是反对宗教本身，也不是狭隘民族主义的排外。这一点是应该弄清楚而不可混淆的。中国真正的基督教徒和天主教徒，他们首先就是爱国的公民，应该坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，热爱自己的祖国，拥护人民政府所进行的政治改革和社会改革，同全国人民一道，用各种志愿行动来抗美援朝保家卫国，巩固中国人民的胜利。
    中国的教会事业应该是中国人民自办的事业，应该把帝国主义的势力从中国教会当中驱逐出去。中国的文化教育、救济事业，应该由中国政府和人民自己来办，不容许帝国主义者来越俎代庖。中国人民已经站起来了，中国已经是一个独立自主的国家，就不能容许帝国主义利用各种宗教和社会事业来进行侵略的殖民地现象的存在。应该割断帝国主义在中国伸出的各色各样的魔爪，才能够切实保障中国的独立自主，维护人民的自由权益。
    中国基督教人士第一批一千五百多人联名发表的以“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”为题的宣言，号召全国基督教徒割断教会与帝国主义国家的关系，实行自治、自养、自传，以达到革新中国基督教的目标。这个宣言申明了中国基督教徒在新中国所应有的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义和建设新民主主义国家的爱国立场。这一宣言，在全国范围已经得到广大的基督教徒和教会团体多数负责人的拥护。截至十二月七日止，全国各地基督教徒在革新宣言上签名的已达二万六千七百二十七人。这一运动还正在扩展中。各地已签名的基督教徒，都一致表示：坚决割断教会与帝国主义的联系，实行自治、自养、自传的方针。川北行政区广元县王良佐（中国神父）等五百多位天主教徒，于十一月底发表了“自立革新运动宣言”，坚决表示在各方面与帝国主义割断关系，实行自治、自养、自传，用实际行动抗美援朝，并决心为建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗，并号召各地天主教教友热烈支持和积极响应这一运动。
    反对帝国主义操纵与控制中国教会的正义斗争，已经在中国的基督教和天主教人士中间扩展开来了。全国各地的宗教界人士应该认识北京宗教界的反帝爱国游行示威的意义，扩大展开这一运动，用自己的行动来反对奥斯订诬蔑中国人民的无耻谰言，揭穿美帝国主义的侵略罪行的实质。基督教和天主教的人士更应该继续扩展宗教革新的运动，特别是各地的爱国的天主教人士应该支持和响应广元县天主教徒五百余人所签名发起的自立革新运动，彻底割断教会与帝国主义的联系，使自治、自养、自传的运动在教会中逐步完全具体实现。应该坚决反对并揭露帝国主义分子利用教会及其他文化、救济事业来遂行其侵略阴谋的活动，来维护我国人民宗教、教育和救济事业的自主权。这就是说，全国的宗教界人士，应该把抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动的精神贯彻到自己的爱国行动中去！
