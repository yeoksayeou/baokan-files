    December 30, 1950, marks the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania. Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian working people overthrew the reactionary forces and the tool of imperialism—the autocratic regime—and established a People's Republic belonging to the working people and intellectuals in both urban and rural areas of the country. It has been three years since then.
    During the period when that autocratic government ruled Romania, it served the large landowners and capitalists and acted as their tool for oppressing and exploiting the working people. Therefore, the working people held deep hatred for it.
    After overthrowing the autocratic government, which concentrated reactionary forces both internally and externally, the Romanian working people opened up a path to a prosperous, free, independent, and happy People's Republic, a glorious path to socialist construction. In the past three years, thorough reforms in all political, economic, and social aspects have been universally implemented in Romania; all old systems that oppressed the working people have been completely eliminated.
    The construction of a new Romanian society, namely socialist construction, has already begun. Romania was originally a semi-colonial country, one of the most backward countries in Europe; but today, in terms of politics and society, it has been ranked among the progressive countries.
    Today, the Romanian working people are greeting the third anniversary of the overthrow of autocracy and the establishment of the republic with new achievements in peaceful struggle and socialist construction.
    The peace struggle movement in Romania is constantly unfolding among the broad masses of the people. More than ten million people have already signed the Stockholm Appeal. This will to defend peace is particularly manifested in the very active work of the working people in urban and rural areas across the country, enabling the national plan to be realized and overfulfilled.
    Today, the lives of the Romanian working people show unprecedented brilliance and light. The entire country has become a vast workshop. Industrial development has reached a level never seen during the capitalist regime.
    In the implementation of the national plan, in the third quarter of 1950, steel production increased by 124% compared to the third quarter of 1949; pig iron production increased by 129%; oil production increased by 110%; and tractor production increased by 114%. At the same time, we also manufactured many important products in the third quarter of 1950 that previously depended on foreign imports.
    The enthusiasm for socialist emulation is surging in Romania.
    On August 23, 1950 (Romania was liberated on August 23, 1944 - translator), 60% of the working people nationwide participated in the socialist emulation to commemorate this day.
    Currently, the Romanian working people have established a new attitude at work, focusing on quality improvement and reducing production costs as much as possible. Therefore, both in the public and private economy, good development has been achieved.
    Romania's agriculture is also advancing along the socialist path. Many state-owned farms, many tractor and machine stations, have worked very hard to help the farmers in more than a thousand collective farms.
    The Luna de Sus, Ţântăreni, and Şinteu collective farms, with the help of state-owned farms, achieved wheat harvests of over 3,000 kilograms per hectare; the harvests of many other collective farms also reached over 2,000 kilograms.
    The living standards of the working people are constantly improving. In the third quarter of 1950, commodity transactions increased by 31% compared to the same quarter last year. In rural areas, this transaction increased by 62%. In the third quarter of this year (1950), 157,000 workers were sent to coastal resorts for rest. Housing for workers and specialized technical personnel has been built in many industrial centers. In 1950 alone, the construction cost of this type of housing was as much as 5.5 billion lei (Romanian currency).
    Medical and health work is also constantly improving.
    The cultural level of the Romanian working people has been raised to a degree unheard of during the rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie. The work of eliminating illiteracy—a painful legacy given by the old regime—is being carried out comprehensively. In 1950, 669,445 illiterate people learned to read and write. In terms of secondary education, there are currently 770 middle schools, an increase of 80% compared to 1938. In terms of higher education, there are already 48,500 university students, an increase of 18% compared to last year (1949). The number of publicly funded places reaches as many as 222,000, an increase of 63% compared to last year.
    All ethnic groups in the country have their own language schools, newspapers, and theaters; radio stations broadcast programs in the languages of all ethnic groups at certain times. At the same time, a new culture with a national form and socialist content has been established among the working people nationwide.
    A brand new and great prospect is unfolding before Romania. The Five-Year Plan, which will be implemented starting January 1, 1951, is expected to increase industrial production by double compared to 1950. The mining volume of coal and pig iron will also increase by nearly double by 1955. The production of oil, steel, and the chemical industry will also increase by more than double. The great project of national electrification will begin simultaneously with the first Five-Year Plan.
    Regarding the ten-year construction plan, we estimate that by 1960, the total power of Romania's central electrical organs will be 2.6 million kilowatts.
    Romania's electrification plan and the implementation of water conservancy projects will reduce the fatigue of the working class. At the same time, due to the mechanization of production, arduous manual labor will be eliminated. Naturally, it will be easy to promote the success of many future Five-Year Plans.
    For farmers, electrification will provide electricity for their homes, improve their cultural level, gradually mechanize their agricultural work, and provide them with rich harvests of agricultural crops.
    For scientists, technical experts, and engineers, electrification opens up the best prospects for them, allowing their technical talents to be developed to better serve the working people.
    In short, this plan lays a bright future for the development of the entire economy of the People's Republic of Romania—industrial and agricultural production.
    The Danube-Black Sea Canal is under construction, and when completed in the future, it will turn those desert areas of Dobruja into areas with new life.
    The Scînteia Building will be able to print millions of newspapers and hundreds of thousands of books in the future.
    The Five-Year Plan will irrigate many arid lands, dry up swampy areas, and develop afforestation. All of this will inevitably greatly increase Romania's agricultural output. We estimate that by 1955, the living standards of the working people will be 80% higher than in 1950.
    On December 3, the people of the People's Republic of Romania expressed their will when electing deputies to the People's Assembly. 110,000 loyal sons and daughters of Romania have been elected. When the working people elect candidates from the People's Democratic Front, they are electing for peace, for the prosperity of the motherland, and for socialism.
    The People's Assemblies elected on December 3 are the local organs of state administration. These People's Assemblies lead the broad working class and peasantry towards national construction. This is an important backbone for the implementation of the national plan, and it will eradicate bureaucracy in the organs at its roots.
    On December 3, the working people of the People's Republic of Romania stood proudly in front of the ballot boxes, proud to be builders of a happy new life, proud to be building socialism, proud of the bright prospects of the Five-Year Plan, and proud of the great plan for national electrification. When they elected candidates from the People's Democratic Front, they elected for peace and socialism, for Romanian-Soviet friendship, for the success of the first Five-Year Plan, and for national electrification.
    The Romanian people expressed their love for their motherland and their firm will to fight for peace and socialism.
    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, said the following in his report "The Electrification Plan of the People's Republic of Romania": "Our people need peace because they hope to build a new life on a new foundation. The great work they do confirms the strong belief that the forces of peace can triumph over the forces of war. Our working people believe that the forces of peace are very strong and will become even stronger in the future; even if the American imperialists want to carry out their evil plans, this force of peace will eliminate this flame of aggression and prevent its destruction of all mankind."
    With the constant help of the Soviet Union, Romania has learned from the rich experience of the Soviet Union. The working people nationwide are launching a struggle to defend world peace, led by the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and resolutely advancing along the path of socialist construction.

    罗马尼亚人民共和国成立三周年
    一九五零年十二月三十日是罗马尼亚人民共和国成立三周年纪念日。罗马尼亚劳动人民在工人党的领导下将反动势力和帝国主义的工具——专制政权推翻以后，建立起一个属于全国城乡劳动人民和知识分子的人民共和国，迄今已有三年了。
    当那个专制政府统治罗马尼亚的时期，为大地主和资本家服务，做了他们压迫与剥削劳动人民的工具，因此，劳动人民对它怀有深切的痛恨。
    罗马尼亚的劳动人民把那个内外反动势力集中的专制政府推翻以后，就开辟了一条走向富强、自由、独立与幸福的人民共和国的道路，一条走向社会主义建设的光荣道路。在过去三年当中，一切政治经济和社会各方面的彻底改革，都在罗马尼亚普遍实施了；一切压迫劳动人民的旧制度，更是被消除净尽。
    罗马尼亚新社会的建设，即社会主义建设，已经在开始着。罗马尼亚原是一个半殖民地国家，是欧洲许多落后国家之一；但是今天在政治与社会方面，她已被列入了进步国家的行列。
    今天的罗马尼亚劳动人民是以和平斗争与社会主义建设的新的成就来迎接推翻专制与建立共和国的三周年纪念日的。
    罗马尼亚的和平斗争运动是经常在广大人民中间展开的。一千万以上人民已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。这种保卫和平的意志，特别表现在全国城乡劳动人民工作非常积极，使国家计划获得实现与超额完成上面。
    今天罗马尼亚的劳动人民生活表现出空前的灿烂光明。整个国土形成一个非常广阔的工场。工业发展已到达资本主义政权时期未曾有过的程度。
    在国家计划的实施上，一九五零年第三季，钢的产量，较一九四九年第三季增加了百分之一百二十四；生铁产量增加了百分之一百二十九；石油产量增加了百分之一百一十；拖拉机产量增加了百分之一百一十四。同时，过去依赖国外进口的许多重要产品，在一九五零年第三季里，我们也制造了很多。
    社会主义竞赛的热情在罗马尼亚澎湃着。
    一九五零年八月二十三日（罗马尼亚是一九四四年八月二十三日解放的——译者）全国百分之六十的劳动人民，为了纪念这个日子，参加了社会主义的竞赛。
    目前罗马尼亚的劳动人民在工作上确立了新的态度，把注意力集中于品质改良并尽可能降低生产成本。因此，无论在公私经济方面，都获得了很好的发展。
    罗马尼亚的农业，同样是循着社会主义道路迈进。许多国营农场，许多拖拉机与机器站，曾经很努力的帮助一千个以上的集体农场里的农民们工作。
    路那德骚斯、三塔那和什那德集体农场，在国营农场帮助下，每一公顷土地的麦子收获量超过了三千公斤；其他的许多集体农场的收获量也达到了二千公斤以上。
    劳动人民的生活水平不断在提高。一九五零年第三季，商品交易较去年同季增加百分之三十一。在乡村里，这种交易增加了百分之六十二。本年（一九五零年）度第三季，有十五万七千个劳动者被送往海岸休养所休息。很多工业中心区都建设了工人和专门技术人员的住宅。单是一九五零年这一年，这种住宅的建筑费用，就有五十五亿雷伊（罗币）之多。
    医药卫生工作，也不断在改进。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民的文化水平已提高至大地主和资产阶级统治时期所未闻的程度。文盲——旧政权所给予的悲痛遗产——的扫除工作，正全面展开。一九五零年，六十六万九千四百四十五个文盲学会了看书写字。中等教育方面，目前中学已有七百七十所，这个数字较之一九三八年增加了百分之八十。高等教育方面，大学生已有四万八千五百人，较之去年（一九四九年）增加了百分之十八。公费名额达二十二万二千之多，这与去年比较，增加了百分之六十三。
    国内各民族都有他们自己语言的学校、报纸和剧院；无线电台并在一定时间里用各民族的语言广播节目。同时，一种民族形式、社会主义内容的新文化已在全国劳动人民中间建立起来。
    崭新的伟大远景，展开在罗马尼亚面前。一九五一年一月一日开始实施的五年计划，预计工业生产的扩展，较之一九五零年要增加一倍。煤炭与生铁的开采量，到一九五五年，也要增加近一倍之多。石油、钢以及化学工业的生产也要增至一倍以上。全国电气化的伟大工程与第一次五年计划同时开始进行。
    关于十年的建设计划，我们估计至一九六零年，罗马尼亚中央电气机关的电力，其总量将有二百六十万千瓦。
    罗马尼亚的电气化计划以及水利工程的进行，将使工人阶级的疲劳减轻。同时，由于生产机械化的关系，艰苦的手工劳动，将被消除。而对于未来的许多五年计划的实施，自然也容易促其成功。
    对农民来说，电气化将使他们的住所获得电灯，将使他们的文化水平提高，将使他们农业工作逐渐机械化起来，将使他们的农业作物获得丰富的收成。
    对科学工作者、技术专家以及工程师来说，电气化为他们开辟出最好的前途，使他们的技术才能获得发展，更好的为劳动人民服务。
    总之，这个计划对罗马尼亚人民共和国整个经济——工业与农业生产的发展，奠定了一个美满的未来。
    多瑙河——黑海运河正在建筑，将来完成时，能使多布鲁查那些荒漠地带变成有新生命的地区。
    火花报大厦将来可印出数百万张报纸，几十万本书籍。
    五年计划将使许多旱地得到灌溉，沼泽地带得以干涸，植林事业得以发展。这一切必然会使罗马尼亚的农业产量大大提高。我们估计到达一九五五年时，劳动人民的生活水平，将比一九五零年高出百分之八十。
    十二月三日，罗马尼亚人民共和国的人民在选举人民议会议员时，已经把他们的意志表示出来。十一万罗马尼亚的忠诚的子弟已被选出。当劳动人民选举人民民主阵线的候选人时，他们是为和平而选举，为祖国繁荣而选举，为社会主义而选举。
    十二月三日选出的人民议会，是国家行政的地方机关。这些人民议会领导广大的工农阶级走向国家建设。这是国家计划实施的重要骨干，对于机关的官僚主义，它将连根的予以铲除。
    十二月三日，罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民是很骄傲的站在投票柜前面，他们为做一个幸福的新生活的建设者而骄傲，为建设社会主义而骄傲，为五年计划的光明远景而骄傲，为全国电气化的伟大计划而骄傲。当他们选举人民民主阵线的候选人时，他们是为和平与社会主义而选举，为罗苏友好而选举，为第一次五年计划成功而选举，为全国电气化而选举。
    罗马尼亚人民表示了他们对祖国的热爱以及为和平与社会主义而斗争的坚决意志。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌——德治在“罗马尼亚人民共和国电气化计划”报告中，曾说过下面的话：“我国人民，因为希望在新的基础上建立新的生活，所以他们需要和平。他们所做的伟大工作，证实了和平力量能在战争力量之前取得胜利的坚强信心。我国劳动人民认为和平力量非常强大，而且将来会更加强大；即使美帝国主义者要执行他们的罪恶计划，这个和平力量会对这个侵略火焰予以消弭而阻止其对整个人类的破坏。”
    罗马尼亚在苏联的经常帮助下，学习了苏联的丰富经验。全国劳动人民正掀起以伟大的社会主义国家苏联为首的保卫世界和平斗争，循着社会主义建设道路坚决的向前迈进。        （对外文化联络事务局译稿）
