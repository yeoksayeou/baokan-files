Christian Women Support the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Beijing YWCA, Yu Xiu'ai

We Christian women love peace, love our country, and care about the happy lives and bright future of mothers and children. Today, American imperialism has committed heinous crimes in Korea and in the sacred territory of our motherland – Taiwan. These crimes have been solemnly pointed out by our representative Wu Xiuquan before the people of the world. The people of the world are cheering for this. American imperialism is in a desperate situation before the judgment of justice. Austin, the running dog of American imperialism, made a disgraceful speech at the Security Council on November 28, insulting the Chinese people, the Chinese church, and its cause. But what is the consequence of Austin's shameless lies? It has inspired every true patriotic Christian to join the people of the whole country in holding patriotic and righteous demonstrations, powerfully answering the lies of American imperialism.

After the demonstrations, we hereby declare to the people of the whole country: From now on, we will unite more closely with the people of the whole country, heighten our vigilance, strengthen the study of current events, further recognize the aggressive nature of American imperialism, and strengthen the work of defending the motherland. At the same time, Christian women must love their own churches with the love of Christ, and actively promote the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. On the other hand, we must enable our undertakings to achieve self-reliance and self-support on the basis of our members. Only in this way can we use our faith and love to create brightness and happiness for the motherland, for mothers, and for the future and lives of children!

    基督徒妇女拥护三自运动
    北京基督教女青年会  俞秀霭
    我们基督徒妇女是热爱和平的，是热爱祖国的，是关心母亲和儿童的幸福生活与光明前途的。今天美国帝国主义在朝鲜，在祖国神圣的领土——台湾，已犯了滔天的罪行。这些罪恶行为，已由我伍修权代表在全世界人民前严正的指出。全世界人民正为之欢欣鼓舞。美帝在正义的审判前狼狈不堪；美帝走卒奥斯汀在十一月二十八日安理会上发表了可耻的演说，污辱中国人民，污辱中国教会及其事业：但奥斯汀无耻谰言的后果是什么呢？是激发起了每一个真实的爱国基督徒和全国人民一道举行了爱国的正义的游行示威，有力地回答美帝的谎言。
    我们在游行示威之后，谨向全国人民宣言：自今以后，我们要和全国人民更紧密团结，提高警惕，加强时事学习，进一步认识美帝侵略本质，加强保卫祖国的工作。同时基督徒妇女一方面要以爱基督的心爱自己的教会，积极推动自立自养自传的三自运动。另一方面我们要使自己的事业在会员的基础上达到自立自养的目的。只有这样，我们才能以自己的信仰与爱心，为祖国为母亲和儿童的前途和生活创造光明与幸福！
