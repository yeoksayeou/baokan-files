    Solving the Problem of Childcare for Women Working on the Huai River Project
    Bengbu City to Set Up Nurseries
    [Our Newspaper] To solve the childcare difficulties faced by women laborers working on the dikes during the Huai River project, Bengbu City is actively preparing to establish nurseries for the Huai River project. Since the start of construction on the eastern and western lines of the ring dikes in Bengbu City, there are more than 2,000 women working on the dikes, with two hundred forty to fifty young children left at home without anyone to care for them. To address this, the Bengbu City Women's Federation recently convened a forum for women from all walks of life and decided to establish women's nurseries for the Huai River project. It is planned to set up a total of five locations. Preparations are currently underway.

    蚌埠市筹组托儿所
    【本报讯】为了解决治淮期间上堤妇女民工对孩童照顾的困难，蚌埠市正积极筹组治淮托儿所。蚌市东、西线圈堤开工后，上堤工作的妇女，计有二千余人；有幼小孩童二百四、五十个，留在家中，无人照顾。为此，蚌埠市妇联于日前召集各界妇女座谈，决定设立妇女治淮托儿站。预定共设五处。现正积极筹备中。
