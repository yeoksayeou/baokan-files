    旅日朝侨反对苛捐杂税  竟遭日警当局非法殴捕
    【新华社讯】日本吉田反动政府出动警察，横暴地镇压反对苛捐杂税的朝鲜侨民。据共同社消息：朝鲜人约四百名于二十四日在神户举行示威游行，要求撤销苛征暴敛的市民税。神户当局竟出动警察，非法逮捕示威者二十九名。神户附近各地朝鲜侨民闻讯大为愤慨，纷纷集中神户，并在二十七日举行示威游行，要求释放被捕者。神户警察局竟动员二千六百名警察，凶暴地攻击游行队伍，殴伤其中二十六人，并逮捕一百六十七人。
    在名古屋，朝鲜侨民不顾日本警察的镇压，先后在二十七日、二十八日两天举行示威，要求发还原属于旅日朝鲜侨民联盟而现在被吉田政府非法侵占的房屋，其中包括学校一所。
