Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    A group of young intellectuals who joined the People's Air Force and Navy in the early days have expressed unanimous satisfaction and pleasure with their new learning and work positions.

    Fifteen students from Tongji University, including Wang Nengyong, Hou Yin, and Yang Yongfu, joined the People's Air Force after graduating this summer. On the 14th of this month, they published an open letter to their fellow students in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily, reporting on their experiences in the People's Air Force over the past four months. The letter stated: "After entering the army, we felt the boundless friendship everywhere and truly experienced the warmth of a revolutionary family. After the study began, the comrades who led the study wanted to tell us everything they knew in great detail. We learn and see, learn and master, truly combining theory with practice closely." The letter also said: "After we came to the army, we truly experienced the glory and greatness of the People's Liberation Army. On Sundays, we go to the streets and are respected and loved everywhere. This is something we could not have felt before putting on our military uniforms, which makes us feel infinitely proud and glorious to join the People's Liberation Army. After initial training, we began to have the enthusiasm to work. We brave the cold and rain to inspect and repair aircraft parts at various stations, and we do not feel tired for several days in a row. Sometimes, in order to complete tasks urgently, we sacrifice sleep. Revolutionary life bestows us with enthusiasm and courage, and we have a lofty ideal: to defend the airspace of our motherland."

    Thirty-five students from Nankai University, including Zhang Wenming, were warmly welcomed by the staff and students of the Naval Academy after joining the school recently. In a letter written to his former classmates on the 6th of this month, Zhang Wenming said: "We received a very warm welcome here. All thirty-five of us, including students studying mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and chemical engineering, have now obtained work positions related to our studies, and everyone is very happy. It is a great honor for us young people to dedicate our enthusiasm and skills to building the national defense of our motherland." Zhang Wenming also reported on their daily, busy, and happy life in the letter.

    参加人民空军海军知识青年
    对新岗位感到满意
    【新华社讯】早期参加人民空军、海军的一批青年知识分子，对新的学习和工作岗位一致感到满意和愉快。
    同济大学王能雍、侯荫、杨永福等十五位学生，在今年暑期毕业后，就参加了人民空军。本月十四日他们在上海解放日报上发表了一封给青年同学们的公开信，报告他们参加人民空军四个月来的情形。信中说：我们进到部队后，感受到了到处洋溢着的无限的友情，真正体会到革命大家庭中的温暖。学习开始后，领导学习的同志不厌其详地想把他们所知道的东西都告诉我们。我们学一样看一样，学会一样掌握一样，真正地做到理论与实际密切结合。信中又说：我们来到了部队，又真正体会到了人民解放军的光荣和伟大。星期天我们上街，到处受到尊敬和热爱，这是我们以前没有穿上军装时所无从感受到的事，使我们觉得参加解放军有无限的骄傲和光荣。我们经过了初步的锻炼，开始有了工作的积极性，我们冒着寒冷和风雨到各场站检查与修理机件，一连几天都毫不觉得累，有时为了突击完成任务，大家便牺牲睡眠。革命的生活赐予我们以热情和勇气，我们有了一个崇高的理想：为了保卫祖国的领空。
    南开大学学生张文明等三十五人，在不久前参加海军学校工作后，受到海军学校工作人员和学员们的热烈欢迎。张文明于本月六日写给他旧日同学们的信中说：我们来到这里受到了非常热烈的欢迎。我们三十五人，包括学数学、物理、化学、电机、机械、土木、化工的同学，现在都已获得了与自己所学有关的工作岗位，大家都是兴高采烈。因为我们青年能够在建设祖国的海防上，献出自己的热忱和技能是非常光荣的。张文明在信中还报告了他们日常紧张愉快的生活状况。
