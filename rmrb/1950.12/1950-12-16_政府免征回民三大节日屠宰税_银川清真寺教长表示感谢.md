Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 14th: Imams of major mosques in Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia Province, issued a written statement on the 13th, expressing their immense gratitude for the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's order to exempt people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam from the slaughter tax on cattle and sheep consumed during the three major festivals. The imams unanimously believe that this order concretely demonstrates the Central People's Government's deep concern and sincere care for the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam, and is a wise measure unprecedented in Chinese history. Ma Jinku, the imam of the Nanda Mosque, also called on all Hui people in the province to consciously abide by government laws and decrees, and to pay taxes on all cattle and sheep slaughtered that are not for festival purposes, and not to evade taxes by taking advantage of this exemption. Islamic imams and fair-minded people in each mosque should also automatically assist tax authorities in implementing this order to prevent tax evasion.

On the 14th, on page 2, in the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers," Article 8, the "Dependent family members who cannot support themselves may be treated according to the following provisions..." the "according to" should be "in accordance with." In Article 6 of the "Provisional Regulations on Commendation and Compensation for Casualties of Revolutionary Workers," "may enjoy the commendation and compensation under Article 2, Paragraph 2 of these Regulations," "Paragraph 2" should be "Paragraph 1."

On the 10th, on page 2, in the news item "'Mao Zedong' Locomotive Completes 200,000 Kilometers of Safe Operation," "From January 1947 to December 7, 1950, in a long operation lasting a total of thirty-five months and seven days," "thirty-five months" should be changed to "three years and eleven months."

    政府免征回民三大节日屠宰税            
    银川清真寺教长表示感谢
    【新华社西安十四日电】宁夏省会银川市各大清真寺教长于十三日发表书面谈话，对中央人民政府政务院发布免征信仰伊斯兰教各族人民三大节日食用牛羊屠宰税的通令，表示无限感激。教长们一致认为：这个通令具体地显示出中央人民政府对于伊斯兰教各族人民的深切照顾与真诚关怀，为中国有史以来所未曾有的贤明措施。南大寺教长马金库并号召全省回民要自觉地遵守政府法令，凡非过节而宰杀牛羊都应缴税，不得借此逃税；各寺伊斯兰教教长和公正人士亦应自动协助税收机关执行此一通令，以防发生漏税现象。
    十四日二版“革命烈士家属革命军人家属优待暂行条例”第八条“其不能自养之人口得分别以下列规定……”句中之“以”应为“依”。“革命工作人员伤亡褒恤暂行条例”第六条中“得享受本条例第二条第二项之褒恤”，“第二项”应为“第一项”。
    十日二版“‘毛泽东号’机车完成二十万公里安全运行”一消息“从一九四七年一月开始，到一九五○年十二月七日为止，在历时共三十五个月零七天的长期运转中”“三十五个月”应改为“三年十一个月”。
