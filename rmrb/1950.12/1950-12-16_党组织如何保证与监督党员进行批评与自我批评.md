In Party organizations, regularly conducting criticism and self-criticism is one of the important methods to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign and continue to improve the ideological and political level of Party members. However, some Party organizations have not paid enough attention to this. Therefore, they have not yet regarded criticism and self-criticism as an important weapon for improving work and transforming ideological style. In this way, it is impossible to avoid limiting criticism to reviewing trivial matters of life, while ignoring the examination of each person's ideology, thinking methods, and work style through work; or limiting criticism and self-criticism to lower-level working comrades, while leading comrades do not set an example. This is the main reason why criticism and self-criticism could not be carried out in some Party organizations in the past.

The experience of this rectification campaign proves that to carry out criticism and self-criticism, the following three issues must be noted:

True criticism must be carried out from the bottom up. But to carry out such criticism, we must first require Party member comrades who hold leadership positions to conduct strict self-criticism of the shortcomings and mistakes in their work. Only in this way can we attract general Party members and the masses to offer criticism and suggestions on the shortcomings and mistakes of leadership work. Some units have not done enough in this regard in the past. Even in this rectification movement, there are still a few Party members who hold leadership positions who still cannot conduct self-criticism with an open mind and adopt a suppressive attitude towards criticism. These people like to say that other people's opinions are "not comprehensive enough" or "not 100% correct." This, of course, hinders the development of criticism and self-criticism and causes some cadres to lose confidence in criticism and self-criticism, and even develop a confrontational mood. On the other hand, Party organizations at all levels have also relaxed or neglected the necessary supervision of these Party members.

The experience of this rectification campaign proves that as long as responsible cadres can take various effective measures to thoroughly examine the leadership work of their departments, general Party member cadres will no longer be afraid of criticism, but can strictly criticize the leadership work and criticize themselves equally strictly. In this way, criticism and self-criticism throughout the Party organization can be quickly unfolded; even affecting non-Party masses to join this wave of criticism, and work will be immediately improved. If the opposite method is adopted, criticism and self-criticism cannot be unfolded; the rectification will also be fruitless.

The main goal of criticism and self-criticism is the shortcomings and mistakes in work. This requires the branch to promote and supervise Party members to examine and summarize their work with a high degree of criticism and self-criticism (which is also one of the most effective ways to ensure the completion of administrative tasks). This rectification movement has proved that this method of checking the implementation of policies can not only effectively correct and prevent shortcomings and mistakes in work, but also deeply understand the ideological style of Party member cadres, so that the ideological level and political level of Party member cadres can be generally improved. Secondly,展开批评与自我批评on work issues can reduce some ideological concerns of Party members about criticism and self-criticism. For example: At the beginning of this rectification movement, some Party member cadres were not accustomed to using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to examine the leadership and themselves. However, after the leading cadres conducted self-criticism and exposed and analyzed the shortcomings and errors in their work, most of the Party member cadres quickly recognized the shortcomings and errors of the leading comrades and themselves; and found ways to correct the errors, thus truly realizing the positive significance of criticism and self-criticism and quickly展开批评与自我批评.

In carrying out criticism and self-criticism, Party organizations must pay attention to two issues: First, change the past attitude of not caring about criticism and self-criticism related to work issues. Naturally, the inspection and summary of work should be led by the administrative responsible comrade. However, Party organizations must guarantee and supervise Party members to conduct criticism and self-criticism seriously. Otherwise, inspection and summary are prone to formalism. For those who perfunctorily cover up their mistakes, the Party organization should carry out ideological struggle with them to ensure the development of criticism and self-criticism. Secondly, in inspection and summary work, Party organizations should educate Party members to conduct self-criticism first, and then criticize others. Because problems in work often involve several people or several units, if everyone first accuses others without examining themselves, then criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out.

The principled issues in the lifestyle of Party members are also the content of criticism and self-criticism. But it cannot be like the kind of painless criticism and self-criticism carried out in some Party organizations in the past. One person says that the recent work is not tense enough; another person reviews that their studies are a bit lax; or reviews that their attitude towards a certain comrade is not good, etc. And the criticisms do not confront each other, and it is over after saying it. Of course, such criticism and self-criticism is both a waste of time and does not solve the problem. Whether it is a work issue or a life issue, we should grasp the typical issues of principle for criticism. Avoid vulgarizing self-criticism into wrangling over some trivial matters of life without principle. Seriously solving a principled issue can improve the ideological awareness of Party members by one step. Talking a lot about non-principled issues, or treating principled issues with a perfunctory attitude, will not have any good results.

When carrying out ideological struggle within the Party, it should mainly be carried out in the form of a branch meeting. In the past, criticism and self-criticism were mainly carried out in groups, the strength was dispersed, and the analysis of problems was often not comprehensive and profound enough. Sometimes, errors that a certain Party member has already reviewed soon occur in another person or even many people. If it is carried out in the form of a branch meeting, it seems on the surface that everyone is solving the problem for one person, but in fact, one person's problem educates everyone. Some Party organizations have gained such experience: After discovering these problems, the branch first conducts in-depth research at the branch committee meeting, and then helps the erroring comrade reflect. When the erroring comrade reflects to a certain extent, a branch meeting is convened for criticism and self-criticism. After the branch meeting, if necessary, discussions can be held in groups to consolidate the results of this ideological struggle. This approach is very successful. Secondly, when carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the branch must be good at guiding everyone to conduct in-depth analysis and research, find out the root cause of the errors, and point out the direction of progress. This will not cause the person being criticized to lose confidence in progress. Some people are often accustomed to general accusations and are not good at solving other people's ideological problems. Party organizations should educate everyone to use their brains, seriously analyze their own errors or the errors of others, and find ways to correct them. After criticism and self-criticism, the Party organization also has the task of supervising and helping Party members correct their errors in concrete actions. And it is necessary to carry out resolute struggle with those Party members who only verbally admit their errors but still remain the same afterward, until they completely correct their errors in concrete actions.

    党组织如何保证与监督党员进行批评与自我批评			宋琤
    在党的组织内，经常地进行批评与自我批评，是巩固整风成果、继续提高党员思想政治水平的重要方法之一。但是有些党组织对此没有引起足够的注意。因此还没有把批评与自我批评当作改进工作改造思想作风的重要武器。这样，就不可能避免把批评局限于对生活琐事的检讨，而忽略了通过工作来检查每个人的思想意识、思想方法和工作作风；或者把批评和自我批评局限于下级工作同志中，而领导同志则不以身作则。这也就是过去在某些党组织中不能开展批评与自我批评的主要原因。
    这次整风经验证明，要开展批评和自我批评，必须注意以下三个问题：
    真正的批评必须自下而上地进行。但是要开展这样的批评，就不得不首先要求担负领导工作的党员同志对自己工作中的缺点与错误进行严格的自我批评，这样才可以吸引一般党员和人民群众对领导工作的缺点与错误提出批评与建议。有些单位过去在这方面是做得很不够的。就是在这次整风运动中，也还有少数担负领导职务的党员，仍然不能虚心地进行自我批评；并对批评采取压制的态度。这些人好说别人的意见“不够全面”，“不是百分之百的正确”。这当然阻碍了开展批评与自我批评；并使一部分干部对批评与自我批评失掉信心，甚至产生对抗情绪。另一方面，各级党的组织也放松或忽视对这些党员进行必要的监督。
    这次整风经验证明：只要负责干部能够采取各种有效办法将本部门的领导工作进行一次彻底的检查，一般党员干部就不再畏惧批评，而能对领导工作进行严格的批评，并同样严格的批评自己。这样整个党组织中的批评与自我批评就能迅速展开；甚至影响到非党群众也投入这种批评热潮中，工作也就马上有所改进。如果采取与此相反的方法，则批评与自我批评就不能展开；整风也将毫无结果。
    批评与自我批评的主要目标，就是工作中的缺点与错误。这就需要支部推动并监督党员以高度的批评与自我批评精神来检查总结工作（这也就是保证行政任务完成的最有效的办法之一）。此次整风运动中已经得到证明，这种检查政策执行情况的方法，不但可以有效地改正与防止工作中的缺点与错误，并且可以深入地了解党员干部的思想作风，因而党员干部的思想水平与政治水平得以普遍地提高。其次，在工作问题上展开批评与自我批评可以减少党员对批评与自我批评的某些思想顾虑。例如：这次整风运动开始时，本来有些党员干部不习惯于运用批评与自我批评的武器，检查领导，检查自己。但在领导干部进行自我批评、揭发分析了自己工作中的缺点与错误后，大多数的党员干部都很快认识了领导同志与自己的缺点和错误；并找到了改正错误的办法，因而切实地体会到批评与自我批评的积极意义，迅速地展开了批评与自我批评。
    在进行批评与自我批评中，党组织必须注意两个问题：首先，改变过去不关心有关工作问题的批评与自我批评的态度。自然，工作的检查总结应该是由行政负责同志领导进行的。但是党组织必须保证与监督党员认真地进行批评与自我批评。否则，检查总结就容易流于形式。对那些敷衍塞责的掩饰错误者，党组织应该与他进行思想斗争，以保证批评与自我批评的展开。其次，在检查总结工作中，党组织应教育党员首先进行自我批评，而后批评别人。因为工作中的问题常常要牵扯到几个人或几个单位，假使每一个人都首先指责别人而不检查自己的话，那末批评与自我批评也是无法展开的。
    党员生活作风中的原则问题，同样也是批评与自我批评的内容。但不能象过去某些党组织中，进行一种不痛不痒的批评与自我批评。这一个人说说最近工作不够紧张；那一个人检讨自己学习有点松懈；或者是检讨一下对某一位同志态度不好等等。并且批评时互不交锋，说完就算。当然这样的批评与自我批评既浪费了时间，又不解决问题。无论对工作问题，对生活问题，都应该抓住原则的典型的问题进行批评。切忌把自我批评庸俗化到纠缠于一些生活琐事的无原则纷争中。认真地解决一个原则问题，党员的思想觉悟就能提高一步。非原则问题谈得很多，或者是以敷衍塞责的态度对待原则问题，都不会有什么好结果的。
    在党内进行思想斗争时，主要以支部大会为单位进行。过去主要以小组为单位进行批评与自我批评，力量分散，分析问题常不够全面深刻。有时某一党员已经检讨过的错误，不久又在另外一个人甚至许多人的身上发生。如果以支部大会为单位进行时，表面上看起来是大家为一个人解决问题，其实是一个人的问题教育了大家。这已有一些党组织取得了这样的经验：在发现这些问题后，支部首先在支委会上进行深入的研究，然后帮助犯错误者进行反省。等到犯错误的同志反省到一定程度时，就召开支部大会进行批评与自我批评。支部大会后，如有必要，还可以再在小组内进行讨论，以便巩固这一思想斗争的成果。这样作法是很成功的。其次，在进行批评与自我批评时，支部必须善于引导大家进行深入的分析研究，找出产生错误的根源，指出前进的方向。这样才不致使受批评的人丧失前进的信心。有些人常常是习惯于笼统的指责，而不善于解决别人的思想问题。党组织就应教育大家开动脑筋，认真分析自己的错误或别人的错误，并找到改正的方法。在批评与自我批评后，党组织还有任务监督并帮助党员在具体行动中改正错误。并要和那些只在口头上承认错误而事后依然如故的党员进行坚决斗争，直到他在具体的行动中彻底改正错误为止。
