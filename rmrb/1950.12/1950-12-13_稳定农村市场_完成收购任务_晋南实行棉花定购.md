Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 9th: State-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province have implemented cotton purchase quotas from farmers. In one month, from October to November, they purchased 1.5 million jin of ginned cotton. This provides a new and effective method for state-owned trading companies to purchase agricultural products and stabilize rural markets.

Prior to adopting this method, state-owned trading companies in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi, in order to ensure that cotton farmers could obtain essential food after selling cotton, sold 50 million jin of wheat at listed prices in the region over two and a half months from September onwards, in conjunction with cotton purchases. However, 40% of this wheat was bought by private merchants for speculation, thus affecting fluctuations in grain prices in cotton-producing areas. At the same time, the development of state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives in the area was still insufficient to meet the needs of cotton purchasing. For example, cotton farmers within a hundred li radius of Yongji County all needed to gather at the Zhao Yi Town purchasing station to sell their cotton. In addition, private cotton shops had long been destroyed by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the war, resulting in a daily market supply of around 140,000 jin of cotton, of which state-owned companies could only purchase one-half to two-thirds. On the other hand, grain companies sold hundreds of thousands of jin of grain daily, yet demand still exceeded supply. In Yuncheng, in front of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and grain company, every day one to two thousand farmers crowded to sell cotton and buy grain.

To improve these abnormal phenomena, from October onwards, state-owned companies began to implement cotton purchase quotas from cotton farmers in seventeen counties of southern Shanxi, at a ratio of 7.5 jin of wheat for 1 jin of ginned cotton. Staff from the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and cooperatives were dispatched to the countryside, and, in coordination with local cadres, they signed cotton purchase contracts with cotton farmers, stipulating that the grain company would pay farmers in grain on the date specified in the contract, with two-thirds of the payment in wheat and the remainder converted into coarse grains. This method was widely welcomed by cotton farmers, and many sold all their cotton to the state-owned trading companies. The cotton purchasing work was therefore able to proceed smoothly. The implementation of the quota system not only cracked down on the speculative activities of some private merchants, avoided an excessive amount of currency in the cotton-producing area market, and stabilized grain and cotton prices, but also resolved the problem of excessive market congestion. For example, currently only one to two hundred cotton farmers regularly come to market in Yuncheng each day, delivering cotton and receiving grain in good order.

Because the quota system effectively protects the interests of cotton farmers, cotton farmers in southern Shanxi are generally requesting state-owned trading companies to increase the quota numbers. New purchase contracts for 1.5 million jin of ginned cotton are currently being finalized. Cotton farmers' confidence in planting cotton next year has therefore been greatly enhanced.

    稳定农村市场·完成收购任务
    晋南实行棉花定购
    【新华社太原九日电】国营花纱布公司和合作社在山西省南部产棉区向农民定购棉花，在十月到十一月的一个月内定购皮棉一百五十万斤，为国营贸易公司收购农产品和稳定农村市场的工作提供了一个新的有效的办法。
    在采取这一办法之前，晋南产棉区国营贸易公司为了使棉农售棉后能获得必需的食粮，在九月以后的两个半月内曾在该地区按牌价抛售小麦五千万斤，配合购棉；但是其中百分之四十却被私商买去进行投机，因此影响到棉产区粮价波动。同时，该地区国营贸易机构和合作社的发展又还不能适应购棉工作的需要，如永济县周围百余里内的棉农都需集中到赵仪镇一个收购点出卖棉花。加以私营花店早已在战争中被日寇和蒋匪所破坏，使得该地每天上市棉花常达十四万斤左右，国营公司只能收购其二分之一到三分之二；另一方面，粮食公司每天售粮几十万斤，仍旧供不应求。在运城，花纱布公司和粮食公司门前，每天拥挤着卖棉、购粮的农民达一两千人。
    国营公司为了改善这些不正常现象，从十月份开始，以七斤半小麦换一斤皮棉的比价，向晋南十七县棉农定购棉花：由花纱布公司和合作社派员下乡，在地方工作干部的配合下，和棉农订立购棉合同，规定由粮食公司按合同所定日期，向棉农支付粮食，给三分之二的小麦，其余以粗粮折合。这一办法获得了棉农广泛的欢迎，不少人都把所有棉花全数售给国营贸易公司。购棉工作因而得以顺利进行。定购办法实行以后，不仅打击了某些私商的投机活动，避免了棉产区市场货币过多的情况，稳定了粮棉价格；而且市场过分拥挤的现象也得到合理解决，如目前运城棉农每天经常上市的只一百几十个人，交棉取粮，秩序良好。
    由于定购办法有效地保障了棉农利益，晋南棉农普遍要求国营贸易公司增加定购数字。新的一百五十万斤皮棉的定购合同，现正继续订定中。棉农对于明年种棉信心因此已大为提高。
