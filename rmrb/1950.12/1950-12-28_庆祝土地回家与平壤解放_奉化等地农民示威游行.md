    Celebrating the Return of Land and the Liberation of Pyongyang
    Farmers in Fenghua and Other Places Hold Demonstrations and Parades
    [Xinhua News Agency] Nearly 20,000 farmers in Fenghua, Cixi, Lishui, and other counties in Zhejiang Province recently held parades and demonstrations to celebrate the return of land and the liberation of Pyongyang.

    The towns of Daqiao and Fengzhong, and the four townships of Shangti, Changting, Shujia, and Sijia, which are under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, have completed land reform, and the farmers are in high spirits. More than 10,000 farmers recently gathered at the county stadium in the county seat to hold a celebration meeting. The venue was filled with red flags and large banners with slogans such as "Celebrate the Victory of Land Reform and Resolutely Resist America and Aid Korea" and "Celebrate the Return of Land and Actively Increase Production." The participating farmers carried rifles, muskets, shotguns, blunderbusses, and knives; some carried hoes and sickles. There were also dragon lantern teams, stilt walkers, and yangko dance teams. The sounds of firecrackers and cheers blended together, demonstrating the great organizational strength and joyful mood of the liberated farmers.

    Liu Shanliang, a representative of the liberated farmers, said at the celebration meeting: "In the past, we were oppressed and exploited by the reactionaries and landlords. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. We resolutely support the People's Government and resolutely resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and country. We will pay high-quality public grain to the state, and we will strengthen the militia organization, consolidate public security, and consolidate national defense." At the meeting, deeds handed over by landlords during land reform were burned. As the blazing fire soared into the sky, the entire venue erupted in cheers. Finally, more than 10,000 farmers held a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" "Support the People's Government!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" along the way.

    Thousands of farmers in Banpu and Zeshan townships in Cixi County, and farmers in the Chengguan District of Lishui in southern Zhejiang, have also recently held rallies to celebrate the victory of land reform and the liberation of Pyongyang.

    【新华社讯】浙江省奉化、慈溪、丽水等县近二万农民，最近曾先后举行庆祝土地还家和解放平壤的游行示威。
    奉化县所属大桥、奉中两镇，和尚田、长汀、舒家、斯家四乡已完成了土地改革，农民情绪高涨。万余农民于日前齐集该县县城体育场，举行庆祝大会。会场上红旗飘扬，高悬大幅标语：“庆祝土改胜利坚决抗美援朝”、“庆祝土地还家积极增加生产”。参加的农民，有的背着步枪、火枪、鸟枪、铳、刀，有的肩着锄头，拿着镰刀。还有龙灯队、高跷队和秧歌队等。鞭炮声与欢呼声响成一片，表现了翻身农民伟大的组织力量和欢乐的心情。
    翻身农民代表刘善良在庆祝会上说：“过去我们受反动派和地主的压迫剥削，现在我们在共产党和毛主席领导下翻身了。我们坚决拥护人民政府，坚决抗美援朝保家卫国。我们要给国家缴纳又干又净的公粮，我们要加强民兵组织，巩固治安，巩固国防。”会上还举火焚烧在土地改革中地主交出的田契。当熊熊烈火腾空时，全场欢声雷动。最后，万余农民举行游行示威，沿途高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“拥护人民政府！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。
    慈溪县半浦、赭山两乡数千农民，和浙南丽水城关区的农民，最近也曾先后举行庆祝土地改革胜利和庆祝平壤解放的大会。
