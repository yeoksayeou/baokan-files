Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 27th: Over six thousand nine hundred people from forty-eight units, including various church groups, schools, and hospitals in Tianjin, held a demonstration and march on the 26th to protest against Austin's slander.

    The rally was held on the square of Fahan Middle School. Red flags fluttered throughout the venue, and each group held high portraits of Chairman Mao, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, and revolutionary leaders from various countries. Pastor Huo Peixiu, Chairman of the Tianjin Christian United Association, spoke at the rally on behalf of the pastors and Christians of Tianjin. He said: We want to declare to American imperialism that the Christians of Tianjin stand on the same battle line as the People's Government to oppose American imperialism. He called on Tianjin's Christians to strengthen the implementation of the principles of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, and to sever relations with imperialism. Zhang Jiarui, a student representative from JinGu University, said: Austin's words cannot deceive us. We have personally experienced the cultural aggression of American imperialism. We must redouble our efforts to study and do our work well under the banner of Chairman Mao. Han Yingcai, Dean of the Women and Children's Hospital, spoke on behalf of church hospitals and nursing schools. He said: We must unite with the peace-loving people of the United States to overthrow the war-mongers of Wall Street.

    After representatives from various units spoke successively, the participants unanimously passed the conference declaration, a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao, a letter to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a letter to colleagues nationwide with enthusiastic applause.

    Then, the demonstration began. Among the participants were many elderly pastors and Christians in their twilight years, as well as waist drum teams and Yangko teams from various schools and hospitals, who performed along the way and were warmly welcomed by the citizens.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 27th: To oppose the cultural aggression of American imperialism and protest against Austin's shameless lies, Nankai University's entire faculty and student body, all professors from Beiyang University, and over two thousand American students in Tianjin, simultaneously held demonstration rallies on the 26th with various religious groups and schools in Tianjin.

    The marching teams gathered at Nankai Square at noon. Nankai University professor representative Yang Shixian, American student representative Zhao Jinsheng, and Nankai University student representative Hu Wenjie spoke successively. They unanimously expressed their indignation at the various cultural aggression schemes of American imperialism, and stated their determination to answer the aggression of American imperialism and Austin's shameless slander with practical actions of resisting America and aiding Korea. Two declarations from the entire faculty and student body of Nankai University and American students opposing Austin's slander were read at the meeting. The protest declaration of the teachers and students of Nankai University pointed out: The "Rockefeller Foundation," manipulated by the American imperialist aggression group, hypocritically used "funding" for the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University through the "Pacific International Society" to collect our country's economic intelligence. For example, for materials on "Tianjin Industry," "North China Rural Economy," and "Northeast Immigrants," the "Pacific International Society" designated that reports be submitted to the society in English for American imperialism to use as intelligence for aggression against China. The declaration concluded: More than five hundred young students from our Nankai University have resolutely signed up to participate in national defense construction, which is the most powerful answer to your so-called "funding." A demonstration march was held after the meeting.
