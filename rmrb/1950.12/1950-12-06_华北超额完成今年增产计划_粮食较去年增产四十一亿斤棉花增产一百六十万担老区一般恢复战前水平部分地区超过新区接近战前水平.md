    Xinhua News Agency: North China's provinces have all exceeded this year's grain and cotton production increase plans. The total grain output in North China increased by 4.1 billion jin compared to last year, exceeding both the original (2.5 billion jin increase) and revised (3.16 billion jin increase) grain production plans for this year, reaching 91% of the pre-war level. In terms of cotton, the total ginned cotton output in North China this year increased by more than 1.6 million dan compared to last year, exceeding the original plan by 100,000 dan; and it has approached the pre-War of Resistance cotton production level. Agricultural production in old liberated areas has generally recovered to the pre-War of Resistance level, with some areas exceeding it, while new liberated areas are also approaching the pre-War of Resistance level.

            Important Reasons for Increased Grain and Cotton Production
    In addition to favorable weather conditions this year, the following are some of the more important reasons why North China was able to exceed its grain and cotton production increase plans:

    First, the farmers' enthusiasm for developing production is very high. Based on this, the people's government has strengthened production leadership and gradually enhanced production planning from top to bottom. Since the beginning of spring, people's governments at all levels in North China have generally convened people's representative conferences and other production-related meetings to widely publicize the people's government's production policies, paying particular attention to eliminating the ideological concerns of some farmers who were "afraid of standing out" and "afraid of eating from the big pot," which hindered the development of production. The production increase plan was deployed from the province and county levels down to the village level. Throughout the year, the provincial people's governments dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside during each important farming season. This year, more than 2,000 cadres from leadership organs above the county level in Shanxi Province went to the countryside. People's governments at all levels also strictly implemented the policy of rewarding production and the leadership method of the mass line, helping farmers solve many difficulties in production materials. In the first half of this year, the entire region issued more than 130 million jin of millet in agricultural loans for farmland water conservancy, livestock, and seeds, and distributed more than 45,000 sprayers and more than 320,000 jin of various insecticides. In addition, state-owned trading departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places also provided great assistance to farmers. For example, the Anyang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province signed more than 2,500 purchase and sale contracts with farmers, especially the signing of cotton pre-purchase contracts, which greatly encouraged farmers' production enthusiasm.

    Second, labor mutual aid organizations, which played a significant role in restoring and developing agricultural production, have further developed in this year's North China production increase campaign, and therefore have exerted even greater power than in the past. According to a survey in Shanxi Province, the unit area yield of autumn crops in general mutual aid groups this year was on average 10% to 20% higher than that of individual households, and some exceeded the harvest of individual households by a factor of one.

    The mass agricultural technology improvement movement and the victory in the struggle against disasters have played a major role in increasing grain and cotton production. This year, the people's governments of North China provinces trained a large number of agricultural technicians during the spring plowing season, generally established agricultural technology promotion agencies, and led farmers to carry out technical improvement work. During the spring and autumn sowings, farmers in most areas of North China implemented warm water seed soaking and chemical seed dressing. For example, in the old liberated areas of Shanxi, 80% of the seeds sown were disinfected. During the summer and autumn harvests, farmers in various places also universally launched field seed selection campaigns, actively striving to realize the five-year plan for the popularization of improved varieties. Other agricultural technology improvement work, such as improving soil, increasing fertilizer application, and improving cultivation methods, has achieved significant results, especially in the struggle against disasters. This year, under the leadership of the government, farmers in North China provinces launched active and effective struggles against wind, hail, and floods, as well as crop diseases and insect pests, reducing the number of crop losses due to disasters in the entire region from 5 billion jin last year to 1.9 billion jin.

    华北超额完成今年增产计划
    粮食较去年增产四十一亿斤棉花增产一百六十万担
    老区一般恢复战前水平部分地区超过新区接近战前水平
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：华北各省农业生产都已超额完成今年的粮棉增产计划。全华北粮食比去年增产四十一亿斤，超过了今年原订的（增产二十五亿斤）和修正的（增产三十一点六亿斤）两个粮食增产计划，达到战前水平的百分之九十一。棉花方面，今年全华北皮棉比去年增产一百六十多万担，比原计划超过了十万担；而且已接近抗战前的棉产水平。老区农业生产一般已恢复到抗战前的水平，部分地区且已超过，新区也接近了抗战前的水平。
            粮棉增产的重要原因
    华北能作到超过粮棉增产计划，除今年雨水调匀的自然条件外，有以下几个更重要的原因：
    首先是农民发展生产的热情很高，在这个基础上，人民政府加强了生产领导，从上到下地逐渐加强了生产计划性。入春以来，华北各地人民政府曾普遍召开各界人民代表会议和其他有关生产的会议，广泛宣传人民政府的生产政策，特别是注意消除了部分农民的“怕冒尖”，“怕吃大锅饭”等等对发展生产有妨碍的思想顾虑。增产的计划，从省、县一直布置到村。一年中，各省人民政府在每个重要的农事季节都抽了大批干部下乡。山西省县以上各级领导机关今年下乡干部有两千多人。各地人民政府又严格贯彻奖励生产的政策和群众路线的领导方法，帮助农民解决了许多生产资料的困难。今年上半年全区共贷出农田水利、牲畜、种籽等农业贷款一亿三千多万斤小米，贷发喷雾器四万五千多架，各种杀虫药三十二万多斤。此外，国营贸易部门和各地供销合作社也给了农民很大的帮助。如平原省安阳专区供销合作社曾与农民订立购销合同二千五百多件，其中特别是棉花预购合同的订立，更大大鼓舞了农民的生产情绪。
    其次，曾经在恢复和发展农业生产中起重大作用的劳动互助组织，在今年的华北增产运动中又有了进一步的发展，因此比过去发挥了更大的力量。据山西省的调查，今年一般互助组秋季农作物的单位面积产量比单干户平均多产百分之十到百分之二十，有的超过单干户收获的一倍。
    群众性的农业技术改良运动，和向灾害斗争的胜利，对于粮棉起了很大增产的作用。华北各省人民政府，今年春耕时曾训练大批农业技术人员，普遍设立农业技术推广机构，领导农民进行技术改良工作。春秋播种时，华北大部地区的农民都实行了温汤浸种和药剂拌种，如山西老区占播种面积百分之八十的种籽都经过消毒。夏收、秋收中，各地农民又普遍展开了田间选种运动，积极为实现五年良种普及计划而努力。其他如改良土壤、增施肥料、改进耕作法等农业技术改良工作，都有显著的成绩，在向灾害斗争上成绩尤大。今年华北各省农民，在政府领导下，向风、雹、水灾，向农作物病虫害展开了积极有效的斗争，使今年全区农作物因灾减产的数字由去年的五十亿斤缩减到十九亿斤。
