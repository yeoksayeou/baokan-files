    Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a letter to all Youth League members, calling on Youth League members to participate in various military cadre schools. The full text is as follows: Dear Youth League comrades:
    The Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council are calling on young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools to accelerate national defense construction and consolidate national defense forces.
    This is a solemn call. Faced with this solemn call, we believe that the Youth League members in our schools and factories will certainly rise up first, respond to the call of the People's Government with the highest enthusiasm, and actively participate in the people's military cadre schools. The enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of patriotic youth throughout the country in the movement for China's national defense construction will be a concrete manifestation of a new upsurge in Chinese youth's patriotism.
    Our motherland, under the barbaric aggression of the imperialists, has endured more than a hundred years of extreme pain and humiliation; our people, under the direct and indirect exploitation and oppression of the imperialists, have lived more than a hundred years of tragic and dark lives. In order to win their own liberation, the Chinese people have heroically carried out successive sacrifices and struggles, and paid an extremely heavy price, before overthrowing the evil rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and establishing the People's Republic of China. Our country has already achieved great success in more than a year of peaceful construction. As long as we make a simple comparison between today, which is full of vitality, and yesterday, which is full of suffering and hardship, we will feel a supreme love for our people's motherland from the bottom of our hearts. The people's motherland is our mother, and the people's motherland is our hope.
    However, the imperialist bandits headed by U.S. imperialism are unwilling to see the freedom and liberation of the Chinese people. They want China and all the oppressed nations of the entire East to remain forever in a state of being bullied and exploited as colonies. This group of colonialist bloodsuckers headed by U.S. imperialism has now not only ignited the flames of aggression in Korea, cruelly slaughtering the Korean people with the most inhuman methods, but also unilaterally tore up the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, openly invaded our Taiwan, and used airplanes to bomb and strafe our peaceful towns and peaceful residents, destroying our peaceful life, and unscrupulously directed the flames of the war of aggression to our northeast border, directly threatening our industrial construction base. The U.S. imperialists thought that the great 475 million people of China were all docile sheep that could be slaughtered by the imperialists. But the era in which China could be slaughtered by the imperialists has passed. Chairman Mao Zedong made a solemn declaration at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Our nation will no longer be an insulted nation, we have stood up." The Chinese people need and are able to use their own strength to give the heinous aggressors a serious blow and a necessary lesson. The Chinese people are able to use their own strength to defend the security and honor of the motherland, and to defend the peace of the East and the world.
    Every one of our male and female Youth League members has asked themselves, how can we best use our strength to serve the people and defend the motherland? Now the motherland needs to strengthen national defense, and needs young people with political awareness and knowledge and technology to learn advanced military science, master modern weapons such as airplanes, warships, artillery, and tanks, and strengthen our modern national defense construction. Male and female Youth League members in schools and factories! Now is the time for us to most effectively contribute our strength to the motherland! We believe that the Chinese New Democratic Youth League members who have been educated in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will live up to the trust and expectations of the Chinese people, lead by example, unite the broad masses of patriotic youth, and become the most active participants in China's modern national defense construction.
    Every one of our male and female Youth League members knows that our New Democratic Youth League's program clearly stipulates: "Make every effort to consolidate the people's armed forces – the People's Liberation Army, actively participate in the construction of the people's navy and air force, and strive to defend the motherland and the people's democracy and lasting peace of the world." Male and female Youth League members in schools and factories! Now is the time for us to put this program into practice with action! We believe that the Chinese New Democratic Youth League members under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China can not only play a role in our economic construction and cultural construction, but also show great strength in the serious struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace!
    Dear comrades, let us bravely advance under the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao Zedong! The people are cheering for us! The motherland is calling us. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the enthusiastic concern of the Chinese people, we will be tempered and grow up in struggle, and forever move from victory to victory!

    青年团中央和全国学联
    号召全国青年学生行动起来  积极参加各种军事干部学校
    【新华社一日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央为号召青年团员参加各种军事干部学校告全体青年团员书，全文如下：亲爱的全体青年团员同志们：
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院号召青年学生和青年工人参加各种军事干部学校，加速国防建设，巩固国防力量。
    这是一个庄严的号召。在这庄严号召的前面，我们相信我们学校和工厂中的青年团员，必将首先奋起，怀着最高的热情，响应人民政府的号召，踊跃参加到人民的军事干部学校去。全国广大爱国青年的热烈参加中国国防建设的运动，将是中国青年爱国主义的新高涨的具体表现。
    我们祖国在帝国主义者的野蛮侵略之下，曾经忍受了一百多年极端的痛苦和耻辱；我国人民在帝国主义者直接间接的剥削压迫之下，曾经过了一百多年悲惨黑暗的生活。中国人民为了争取自己的解放，曾经英勇地进行了前仆后继的牺牲奋斗，付出了极其重大的代价，才在中国共产党和中国人民英明领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，推翻了帝国主义和封建主义官僚资本主义在中国的罪恶统治，缔造了中华人民共和国。我们国家在一年多的和平建设中，已经获得了巨大的成绩。我们只要把充满着生气象的今天和充满苦难酸辛的昨天作一个简单的对比，我们就会从心底里涌现出对人民祖国至高无上的热爱。人民祖国是我们的母亲，人民祖国是我们的希望。
    可是，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义匪帮，他们不愿意看到中国人民的自由解放，他们要中国和整个东方的一切被压迫民族永远停留在被欺凌被剥削的殖民地地位。以美帝国主义为首的这群殖民主义者吸血鬼，现在已经不但在朝鲜燃起侵略的大火，用最惨无人道的方法残酷地屠杀朝鲜人民，而且他们一手撕毁开罗宣言和波茨坦决议，公然侵略我国台湾，并用飞机轰炸扫射我国的和平城镇与和平居民，破坏我国的和平生活，肆无忌惮地把侵略战争的大火，引向我国东北边境，直接威胁我国工业建设的基地。美帝国主义者以为中国伟大的四万七千五百万人民都是驯服的绵羊，可以听凭帝国主义者操刀宰割。但是中国可以任凭帝国主义者宰割的时代已经过去了，毛泽东主席早已在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上作过庄严的宣告：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站立起来了。”中国人民需要而且能够用自己的力量给予万恶的侵略者以严重的打击和必要的教训，中国人民能够用自己的力量来保卫祖国的安全和荣誉，保卫东方和世界的和平。
    我们每一个男女青年团员，都曾问过自己，怎样才能最好地运用自己的力量来为人民服务，来捍卫祖国？现在祖国正需要加强国防，需要有政治觉悟和有知识技术的青年，来学习先进的军事科学，掌握飞机、军舰、大炮、坦克等近代化的武器，加强我国近代化的国防建设。学校和工厂中的男女青年团员们！现在正是到了我们把自己力量最有效地贡献给祖国的时机了！我们相信在马列主义、毛泽东思想教育下的中国新民主主义青年团员，将会不负中国人民的信托和期望，以身作则，团结广大爱国青年，成为我国近代化国防建设的最积极的参加者。
    我们每一个男女青年团员都知道，在我们新民主主义青年团的工作纲领上明确地规定着：“全力巩固人民的武装力量——人民解放军，积极参加建设人民的海军和空军，为捍卫祖国和全世界的人民民主与持久和平而奋斗。”学校和工厂中的男女青年团员们！现在已经到了我们用行动来实践这一条纲领的时候了！我们相信在中国共产党直接领导下的中国新民主主义青年团员，不但能在我国经济建设文化建设的事业当中发挥作用，而且能在保卫祖国、保卫和平的严重斗争当中表现巨大的力量！
    亲爱的同志们，让我们在毛泽东主席的光辉旗帜下，勇敢前进吧！人民在向我们欢呼！祖国在向我们召唤，在中国共产党的坚强领导和中国人民的热烈关怀下，我们将在斗争中锻炼成长，永远地从胜利走向胜利！
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
