Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: Xining dispatch: The first Qinghai Provincial Representative Conference of People of All Nationalities and All Circles, exercising the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress, has successfully concluded. As of the end of September, all counties in the agricultural areas of the province had held two to three representative conferences of people of all nationalities and all circles. Following the All-Province Nationalities Friendship Association held this January, ethnic friendship associations were also held separately in the pastoral counties. These meetings strengthened national unity, facilitated the smooth progress of various construction projects, and laid the foundation for the convening of this conference.

The representatives of the people of all nationalities and all circles attending the meeting listened to and discussed the report on the work of the Provincial People's Government over the past nine months and the opinions on future work given by Chairman Zhao Shoushan, the report on rent reduction in agricultural areas by Vice Chairman Zhang Zhongliang, and reports from responsible persons of other relevant units. The delegates unanimously agreed that the work of the People's Government since the liberation of Qinghai has been remarkably successful, especially in strengthening national unity and suppressing bandits. Mongolian representative Zaoqie and Hui representative Ma Boling said: The province has implemented a joint ethnic regime and ethnic regional autonomy, and governments at all levels have paid attention to absorbing cadres from all ethnic groups to participate in the work, which was impossible during the reactionary rule. Regarding the issue of rent reduction, the representatives believed that rent reduction should be carried out step by step and with differentiation, based on the demands of the people of all nationalities, in order to weaken feudal exploitation, alleviate the suffering of peasants, and initially improve the lives and raise the production enthusiasm of peasants. Representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the just demands of farmers regarding rent reduction.

The conference approved the reports of Chairman Zhao Shoushan and others, and decided that the guiding principle for the work of Qinghai Province in the future should be: to continue implementing the ethnic policy, strengthen national unity; resolutely eliminate bandits and special agents, consolidate social security; develop production and construction, and do a good job in trade in pastoral areas. The conference also decided to take the collection of autumn public grain and rent reduction in some areas as the central tasks for the current work.

The conference elected 33 people as Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Provincial People's Government Committee. The conference also elected Zhang Zhongliang as Chairman of the First Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, Zha Xi (Tibetan) and Ma Liang (Hui) as Vice-Chairmen, and 45 members.

During the conference, a comprehensive exhibition was held, including departments such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, culture, education, health, industry, mining, and trade, attracting tens of thousands of visitors. The exhibition played a significant role in boosting the confidence of people of all nationalities in developing production.

    代行人民代表大会职权
    青海举行各族各界代表会议
    选出省人民政府委员会正副主席及委员
    【本报讯】据新华社西安电：西宁讯：代行省人民代表大会职权的青海省首届各民族各界人民代表会议，已圆满闭幕。截至九月底为止，该省农业区各县都已开过两次到三次各民族各界人民代表会议；继今年一月全省各民族人民联谊会之后，游牧区各县也分别举行了民族联谊会。通过这些会议，加强了民族团结，使各项建设工作顺利展开，为这次会议的召开奠立了基础。
    出席会议的各民族各界人民代表先后听取和讨论了省人民政府赵寿山主席关于九个月来的工作报告和今后工作意见，张仲良副主席关于在农业区进行减租问题的报告和其他有关单位负责人的报告。与会代表一致认为：青海解放以来，人民政府的工作是有显著成绩的，特别在加强民族团结、清剿土匪方面，成绩更大。蒙族代表早切、回族代表马柏岭等说：本省已实行了民族联合政权和民族区域自治，各级人民政府都注意吸收各民族干部参加工作，这都是反动统治时候所没有的。关于减租问题，代表们认为：根据各民族人民的要求，有步骤、有区别的进行减租，以削弱封建剥削，减轻农民痛苦，初步改善农民生活，提高农民生产情绪。各界代表在会上均纷纷发言，一致支持农民关于减租的正义要求。
    会议通过了赵寿山主席等的报告，决定青海省今后的工作方针应该是：继续贯彻推行民族政策，加强民族团结；坚决肃清土匪特务，巩固社会治安；开展生产建设，做好牧区贸易工作。会议并决定以征收秋季公粮和在部分地区进行减租为当前中心工作任务。
    会议选出了省人民政府委员会的正、副主席和委员共三十三人。会议并选出了张仲良为省首届各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席，扎喜（藏）、马良（回）为副主席及委员四十五人。
    会议在进行期中，并举办了一个包括农林、水利、畜牧、兽医、文教、卫生、工矿和贸易等部门的综合大展览会，前往参观者达数万人。展览会对各民族人民发展生产的信心，起了很大作用。
