Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 12th: The British authorities in Hong Kong are continuously persecuting our compatriots. On November 15th, the British authorities in Hong Kong forcibly evicted our compatriots living in Yau Ma Tei, Chung Shan Village, and Fortress Hill near Causeway Bay, demolishing more than 1,000 wooden houses, leaving over 10,000 compatriots homeless. On December 6th, the British authorities dispatched more than 100 policemen, forcing our compatriots in Dak Gu Ling Village northwest of Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon to immediately demolish all of their 400+ wooden houses. More than 3,000 compatriots from over 400 households are now homeless in the freezing weather. Our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are extremely indignant at this barbaric and unreasonable behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

    香港英国当局横蛮无理强迫我国同胞拆毁住房
    【新华社广州十二日电】香港英国政府不断迫害我国同胞。十一月十五日，香港英当局曾强迫在铜锣湾附近芽菜坑、中山坑及炮台山等地居住的我国同胞拆毁木屋一千多间，致万余同胞无家可归。十二月六日，英国当局竟又派出警察一百多人，强迫九龙启德机场西北打鼓岭村我国同胞立即将所居住的四百多间木屋全部拆毁。四百多户的三千多同胞都在天寒地冻中无所归宿。港九我国同胞对香港英国当局这种横蛮无理的行为，极为愤慨。
