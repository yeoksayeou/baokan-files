    People Are Changing the Face of the Sandy Wasteland
    ——Reader Wang Bo Reports on Afforestation in Western Hebei

To the Editor:

    I'm writing to tell you that recently, the Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Afforestation Bureau) of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation led the people of Xingtang and four other counties to complete a great afforestation project of 6,777 mu in just half a month.

    To green these large sandy wastelands, the first thing to do is to establish the masses' confidence in completing this great task. After September of this year, the Commissioner's Office, the County Government, and the District Government all convened meetings of afforestation activists; afforestation workers went to key villages to explain the benefits and methods of afforestation to the masses. The method of public-private cooperative afforestation is very popular among the masses. This method involves profit-sharing according to shares: those who contribute labor during afforestation have their labor counted as shares; those who contribute seedlings have their seedlings counted as shares; if trees are planted on your land, your land is also counted as shares, and when the trees grow up in the future, everyone shares the profits according to their shares. The masses’ erroneous idea of "planting trees for the public" has been eliminated, and they have all happily participated in afforestation cooperatives. Before the start of afforestation, the Afforestation Bureau sent photos related to forestry to Xingtang, Xinle, Zhengding, Wuji, and Gaocheng for exhibition. Around October 10th, the afforestation work, with the participation of more than 7,000 people, began.

    In Dongciting, Zhengding, 200 workers completed the planting of more than 80,000 holes in three days, averaging 270 holes per worker per day. The Nangao Village Afforestation Cooperative in Xingtang proposed a method of dividing into groups and sections, with ten people forming a group, scientific division of labor: six people digging pits in six rows, two people placing seedlings, and two people backfilling the soil; the group members proposed a competition slogan of "dig pits quickly, place seedlings quickly, and backfill the soil quickly." Zu Laosan, the deputy leader of the militia, dug more than 400 pits on the first day. Zu Jinhai, a young man, refused to be outdone and proposed to surpass him. Sure enough, on the third day, he dug 580 pits. By around November 25th, 1,718,054 locust and purple lespedeza trees had already been planted on the sandy wasteland.

    In order to improve the survival rate of seedlings, forestry cadres went deep into each group to provide guidance. The masses said, "The Afforestation Bureau has done research; this way, we are guaranteed to plant one tree and have it live."

    Next spring, these 6,700+ mu of barren sandy wasteland will be transformed into beautiful windbreaks due to the growth of the tender green leaves of these more than one million locust and purple lespedeza trees.

    人们改变着沙荒的面貌            
    ——读者王波报告冀西造林情况编辑同志：
    我告诉你：最近林垦部冀西沙荒造林局（以下简称造林局）领导行唐等五县人民，在半月之间完成了六千七百七十七亩的伟大造林工程。
    要绿化这些大沙荒，首先要建立起群众完成这个伟大任务的胜利信心。今年九月以后，专署、县府、区政府都分别召开了造林积极分子会议；造林工作同志分别亲到各重点乡，给群众讲造林的好处和办法。公私合作造林的办法，群众非常欢迎。这个办法是按股分红，造林时出了劳力的，把劳力算作多少股；出了树苗的，把树苗算成多少股；在你土地上种树的，你的土地也算作股，将来树长大了，大家按股分红。群众“给公家栽树”的错误想法被消除了，他们都高高兴兴地参加了造林合作社。造林开始前，造林局把有关林业的照片送到行唐、新乐、正定、无极、藁城去展览。十月十日左右，有七千余群众参加的造林工作就开始了。
    正定东慈亭二百个工，三天完成了造林八万余穴，每工每日平均造林二百七十穴。行唐南高里造林合作社，提出划组分段办法，十人编成一组，科学分工，六人分六行挖坑，二人放秧，二人埋土；组员提出“快挖坑，快放秧，快封土”的竞赛口与。民兵副队长祖老三第一天挖坑四百多个，青年小伙子祖金海不服气，提出超过他，果然第三天他挖了五百八十个坑。到十一月二十五日左右，沙荒地上就已经植上一百七十一万八千零五十四棵洋槐、紫穗槐了。
    为了提高树苗的成活率，林业干部都深入各小组指导，群众说：“造林局有研究，这样作保证栽一棵活一棵。”
    明年春天，这六千七百余亩不毛的沙荒地，就因这一百多万棵洋槐、紫穗槐生长出来的柔嫩绿叶而变成了美丽的防风林。
