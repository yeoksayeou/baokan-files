    Tianjin Business Community Resolutely Fights to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country!
    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce

    Ignoring the opposition and warnings of the Korean and Chinese people, the U.S. imperialist aggressors are following the old path of Japanese aggression, frantically launching a war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, they dispatched the Seventh Fleet, arbitrarily invading our Taiwan territorial waters, and extending the flames of war to our Northeast border, with planes unreasonably reconnoitering, strafing, and bombing our Northeast. This series of aggressive acts is truly intolerable and unbearable for our peace-loving people.

    The new China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, was established not long ago. The long-awaited improvement in financial and economic conditions, stable prices, and a situation of national independence, democracy, peaceful unification, and prosperity are gradually being realized. We need long-term peaceful construction. U.S. imperialism is precisely the enemy of our peaceful construction. In order to control the Chinese market and enslave the Chinese people, it is doing everything possible to undermine China's peaceful construction and provoke wars of aggression. Recalling the painful history of U.S. imperialist aggression against us over the past century, the old hatred has not yet subsided, and new hatred has been added. We have recognized the heinous U.S. imperialism. We have recognized that it is the enemy with the deepest conspiracy to invade our country. National industrialists and businessmen—an integral part of the government—are concerned about the safety of their own country and understand the principle that protecting one's home requires defending the country, and defending the country requires saving one's neighbor. Now, they are stepping forward, turning shame and hatred into strength, and resolutely demanding that U.S. imperialism repay this blood debt.

    The Chinese Volunteer Army has achieved brilliant and great victories in its actual actions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, placing the arrogant and unbridled enemy in a passive position strategically, causing significant losses in materials, and deepening the internal contradictions within the aggressive camp politically. U.S. imperialism has suffered a severe blow this time, and it may retreat in the face of difficulties, or it may take risks and launch an even more unreasonable war, which requires special vigilance.

    The patriotic Tianjin business community has demonstrated unprecedented achievements in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, formulating four tasks and resolutely implementing them. Through a demonstration of more than 42,000 people, the united front of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has been further consolidated. These unprecedented achievements must be consolidated, expanded, and promoted with stable, sustained, vigilant, and active actions. That is, stabilizing finance and prices, launching patriotic production competitions, preventing espionage and sabotage activities, ensuring the supply of materials, and enthusiastically paying taxes. We must hold our posts on the economic front, strive for victory, and fight to the end for the final victory of defending lasting world peace.

    天津工商界坚决为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗！
    天津工商联主任委员  李烛尘
    美帝侵略者不顾朝鲜和中国人民的反对和警告；循着日寇侵略的老路，疯狂发动对朝鲜的侵略战争，同时派遣第七舰队，擅自侵我台湾领海，并且把战火扩展到我东北边境，飞机无理的侦察扫射轰炸我东北。这一连串的侵略行为实使我爱好和平的人民万难容忍万难坐视。
    新中国在毛主席英明领导下立国不久。多年来憧憬的财经情况好转，物价稳定，和国家独立、民主、和平统一、富强的局面已逐步实现。我们需要长期的和平建设。美帝正是我们和平建设的敌人。它为着控制中国市场，奴役中国人民，就千方百计的破坏中国的和平建设，挑起侵略战争。回忆一下近百年来美帝侵略我们的辛酸惨痛历史，真是旧恨未已又添新仇。穷凶极恶的美帝，我们已经认清了。认清了它是侵略我国阴谋最深的敌人。民族工商业者——政府组成之一环——已关切到自己国家之安全，懂得了保家必先卫国，卫国必须救邻的道理。现在挺身而出，要化耻辱仇恨为力量，要坚决去向美帝讨还这笔血债。
    中国志愿部队在抗美援朝实际行动中，已获得了光辉伟大的胜利，使骄横放肆的敌人在战略上陷于被动，物资上遭受了重大损失，政治上加深了侵略阵营的内部矛盾。美帝受到了这次头破血出的严重打击，也可能就会知难而退，也可能挺而走险，发动更无理的战争，这是需要特别提高警惕的。
    爱国的天津工商业在抗美援朝运动中，曾表现了空前成就，订出了四项任务，坚决去执行。透过了四万二千余人的示威大游行，把抗美援朝的统一战线更加巩固。这些空前成就要巩固起来，扩大起来，发扬起稳定的持久的警觉的积极行动。那就是稳定金融物价、展开爱国生产竞赛、防止特务活动与破坏、保证物资供应、踊跃纳税。我们要在经济战线守着了岗位，争取胜利，要为保卫世界持久和平的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
