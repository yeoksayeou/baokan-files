    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, TASS dispatch from December 10th citing Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur (DPA) Bonn news: West German Bonn government Deputy Prime Minister Blücher, in private conversations, revealed plans to establish a West German army consisting of twenty to twenty-five divisions. Blücher's remarks followed Bonn Finance Minister Schäffer's call for the establishment of a West German mercenary army, with Schäffer calling for the creation of twenty-two fully motorized divisions, including ten tank divisions. To this end, he demanded that the West German budget for the 1950-51 fiscal year allocate 600 million marks for the purchase of land, construction of barracks and training grounds, and the establishment of various organizations related to the West German army. In the 1951-1952 fiscal year budget, 1.7 billion marks should be allocated for this purpose. However, the actual cost of maintaining and expanding the West German army would far exceed this amount.
    According to sources within the Bonn government, the organizational work for establishing the West German army is proceeding smoothly. The headquarters of former Hitler's 5th Panzer Army commander Schwering, under the guise of the so-called "Economic Research Institute," continues to operate in Bad Godesberg and has formulated detailed plans for implementing universal conscription in West Germany. Preparations are currently underway to delineate conscription zones and military control areas; military control areas will be directly under the Allied High Commission and will work in conjunction with labor exchanges. A list of doctors designated to conduct physical examinations for conscripts has also been drawn up.
    According to instructions from the American authorities, West Germany must first establish forces not exceeding one-fifth of the total number of troops of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc countries. In addition to this, the Western occupying powers will also control 350,000 Germans who can be deployed at will. Among them, 66,000 are skilled drivers.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Berlin, November 22nd, TASS: West Berlin, which is being transformed into the so-called American "outpost" in Europe, has been assigned an important role in the adventurous plans of the American and British warmongers. With this in mind, the occupying authorities in West Berlin are conducting war propaganda in newspapers and radio broadcasts, intensifying the persecution of peace advocates, increasing the occupying garrison, transforming the "Stumm" police into military units, and recruiting German mercenaries.
    According to German democratic newspapers, the American occupation authorities in the region began organizing new "workers' battalions" more than a month ago, enlisting former Wehrmacht soldiers first. To date, nearly 700 people have been recruited and immediately sent to barracks.
    The American occupation authorities in Berlin also intend to supplement their mercenary battalions by recruiting criminals incarcerated in West Berlin prisons.
    Western countries have decided to arm more than 13,800 police officers in West Berlin with light machine guns, automatic rifles, and carbines.
    The *Nürnberger Nachrichten* pointed out: "Arming the police constitutes a violation of the Four-Power Agreement of 1945."

    西德傀儡政府副总理透露
    西德重整军备计划       
    将成立二十个以上的师
    柏林西区进行募兵并武装警察
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社十日电引德意志通讯社波恩消息：西德波恩政府副总理布吕契，在私下谈话中透露了准备成立包括二十个到二十五个师的西德军的计划。布吕契此项谈话是在波恩财政部长夏非尔要求建立西德雇佣军后发表的，夏非尔呼吁成立二十二个完全摩托化的师，其中包括十个坦克师。他为此要求西德在一九五○——五一财政年度的预算中，应有六亿马克拨作购置地基、修建兵营和练兵场以及成立与西德军队有关的各种组织之用。在一九五一——一九五二财政年度的预算中，要有十七亿马克的拨款用在这一方面。不过，为维持并扩大西德军队所需的费用，实际上还要大大超过这个数目。
    据波恩政府方面人士称：建立西德军队的组织工作正在顺利进行中。在所谓“经济研究所”的伪装下的前希特勒第五装甲兵团司令许威林的总部，仍在巴德高得斯堡继续工作，并已制定在西德实行普遍征兵的详细计划。目前正在进行划定征兵区与军管区的准备工作；军管区将直属盟国高级专署，与劳工介绍所配合工作。被指定为应征入伍者检查体格的医生名单亦已拟定。
    根据美国当局的训令，西德必须首先建立人数不超过北大西洋侵略集团各国军队总数五分之一的部队。除此而外，西方占领国家并将掌握三十五万可以任意调用的德国人。其中有六万六千人是熟练司机。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林十一月二十二日电：正被变成所谓美国在欧洲“前哨”的柏林西区，在美英战争贩子们的冒险计划中被安排了一个重要的地位。柏林西区的占领当局怀着这种目的在报纸和无线电广播上进行着战争宣传，加紧迫害和平拥护者，增加占领警卫军，把斯图姆警察变成军事单位，并征募德国的雇佣兵。
    据德国民主报纸报道：一个多月以前，美国区域的占领当局开始组织新的“工人大队”，使以前的德军在役军人首先入伍。截至现在为止，已经征募了将近七百人，并将他们立即送入兵营内。
    柏林的美国占领当局并打算通过征募柏林西部监狱内所监禁的罪犯们去补充他们的雇佣兵大队。
    西方国家已经决定用轻机关枪，自动步枪，和卡宾枪等去武装柏林西区的一万三千八百多名警察。
    《纽伦堡新闻报》指出：“武装警察的结果构成了违反一九四五年的四国协定的行动。”
