    National Gathering of Opera Workers: 350,000 Opera Workers, 3 Million Audience Members. 
    Meeting to Discuss and Resolve Opera Reform Guidelines and Policies.
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Opera Work Conference of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on November 27th. In the past few days, in addition to reports on opera reform from various regions, the conference will discuss the guidelines and policies for opera reform work, the revision, writing, review, and supply of scripts, as well as the unity and education of the vast number of opera workers.

    Opera is one of the most powerful tools for connecting with the masses. According to recent surveys, there are 89 types of opera nationwide, including Kunqu, Yiyang, Bangzi, and Pihuang, with the actual number likely exceeding 100. There are 81 types of folk arts, from drum books to various techniques, with the actual number likely exceeding 200. Statistics from 69 regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xuzhou, and Shenyang show that there are 76,187 professional performers, 1,348 theaters, 468 teahouses, and 1,670 privately-run opera troupes (publicly-run troupes not included). Shanghai has the most diverse range of opera types. The total number of actors in local Yue opera, Peking opera, Shanghai opera, Jianghuai opera, comedy, Pingtan, and other opera types is over 8,000. Adding musicians, stage workers, and front and back-stage staff, the total number of people is approximately 15,000. It is estimated that there are at least 350,000 professional performers in the nation's 2,000-plus county towns. If we include the vast number of semi-professional or amateur performers in urban and rural areas, the number would be even larger. Taking the 13 counties in the Hengshui Special Zone of Hebei as an example, out of a total of 614 amateur opera troupes, 409 are old rural opera troupes, accounting for approximately 67 percent. The old opera audience in Beijing is approximately 25,000 people per day, and in Shanghai, it is approximately 150,000 people per day. A rough estimate for 69 cities puts the daily audience for old operas at approximately 1.8 million people, and the national daily audience is likely over 3 million.

    Precisely because opera is an art form with a vast audience, the work of opera improvement has always been very important. Since 1944, opera work in the old liberated areas, under the leadership of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, has begun to improve. After the establishment of the Central People's Government last year, the Ministry of Culture established the Opera Reform Bureau to carry out nationwide opera reform work based on the existing foundation. Over the past year, opera reform organizations have been established throughout the country, and mass organizations for opera reform have been formed. Under these conditions, a considerable number of new scripts have been produced and performed in the past year. According to statistics, there are more than 190 new Peking operas, folk arts, and local operas, which have received enthusiastic support and welcome from the broad masses of people. Regarding the unity and transformation of old artists, over the past year, more than 50,000 old artists have participated in political and professional studies, which has greatly helped to improve their political and ideological level and the reform of opera work, and they have begun to establish a perspective of serving the people. During the process of opera reform, many representative figures in the opera world, such as Mr. Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Yuan Xuefen, have actively participated and led the opera reform work. However, in addition to its achievements, there are also many problems in the national opera work that need to be corrected. For example, regarding the implementation of the guidelines and policies of opera reform, some regions are not clear about the central opera reform guidelines and policies, and deviations inevitably occur when dealing with problems. The most prominent is the issue of banning operas. For example, in Northeast China, Xuzhou, and southern Shanxi, too many operas were banned, which not only failed to meet the needs of the masses but also caused economic difficulties for performers, which has since been corrected. Second, regarding the issue of script compilation, review, and supply, not enough work has been done on the creation and revision of scripts. Solving the script shortage is also an important current task. Third, regarding the reform of the folk arts system, such as the apprentice system and adopted daughter system that existed in the old opera world in the past, these must be handled step-by-step and in a planned manner. Finally, regarding the education and transformation of old artists, in addition to certain gains in political and ideological education, due to the lack of specialized cadres, it has not been fully implemented in professional work. It is expected that these problems will be further improved after the convening of this conference.

    The conference is attended by representatives of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, cadres engaged in opera reform work from major administrative regions and 47 provinces and cities including Beijing and Shanghai, representatives of various drama and folk art workers, and representatives of new music and new drama workers, totaling more than 200 people. Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, in his opening remarks, called on the nation's 350,000 opera workers to further unite and jointly promote opera reform work, create new, excellent, national, and mass artistic forms, and shoulder the glorious task required by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: art serving the people, enlightening the people's political consciousness, and encouraging the people's labor enthusiasm. Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, Hu Qiaomu, Secretary-General, and Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, as well as representatives of opera workers Mei Lanfang, Zhang Decheng (old Sichuan opera performer), Ouyang Yuqian, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Gai Jiaotian, and Lian Kuoru, also spoke.

    In today's high tide of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the convening of the conference is of even greater significance. As many representatives at the conference enthusiastically stated, the opera world must exert all its strength to complete this glorious task in this movement. For example, Mr. Mei Lanfang firmly stated in his speech at the conference: "I have a wish that in today's nationwide upsurge of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, our opera world must take out all our strength and conduct in-depth and extensive propaganda on the stage, on the streets, in the squares, and on the radio in various ways to cooperate with this just movement." Mr. Zhou Xinfang's speech also enthusiastically guaranteed that the task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country would be implemented in the opera world at this conference.

    全国戏曲工作者大会师  现有戏曲工作者三十五万人观众三百万 
    会议将讨论与解决戏改方针政策等问题
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部的全国戏曲工作会议于十一月二十七日在京开幕。几日来除各地汇报剧改情况外，会议对戏曲改革工作的方针和政策，剧本的修改、编写、审查及供应，以及对广大戏曲工作者的团结和教育等问题，均将进行讨论。
    戏曲是联系群众最有力的工具之一。据最近调查，全国剧种计有昆、弋、梆子、皮簧等八十九种，实际当在百种以上。曲艺自鼓书以至各种技术已有八十一种，实数当不下二百种。就京、津、沪、汉、徐、沈等六十九个地区汇报统计：各地城市职业艺人共有七万六千一百八十七人，戏院一千三百四十八所，茶社四百六十八所，私营剧团一千六百七十个（公营未计）。尤以上海一埠剧种最多。当地越剧、京剧、沪剧、江淮戏、滑稽戏、评弹以及其他剧种的演员总数八千余人。加上音乐场面、舞台工作者，前后台职工，总人数约一万五千人。据估计，全国二千余县城，职业艺人至少在三十五万人以上。若联及广大城乡半职业或业余艺人，人数当更庞大。以河北衡水专区十三个县为例，在其总数六百十四个业余剧团中，农村旧剧团占四○九个，约当百分之六十七。旧戏曲观众，北京每日约二万五千人，上海每日约十五万人。就六十九座城市粗略估计，每日旧戏曲观众，约一百八十万人，全国每日观众当逾三百万人。
    正由于戏曲是拥有广大群众的艺术形式，因此戏曲改进工作历来就非常重要。自一九四四年来，老解放区的戏曲工作在毛主席文艺方向的领导下便已开始了改进。去年中央人民政府成立后，文化部便成立了戏曲改进局，在既有的基础上进行全国范围内的戏改工作。一年以来，全国各地建立了戏曲改革的机构，成立了戏曲改革的群众性的团体。在这样的条件下，一年间产生和演出了相当数量的新的剧本，据统计，新的京戏、曲艺及地方戏共有一百九十多种，这些新的戏曲受到了广大人民热烈的支持和欢迎。关于旧艺人的团结与改造，一年来全国有五万多旧艺人都参加了政治学习和业务学习，对于提高他们的政治思想水平和戏曲工作的改革都有很大的帮助，开始建立了为人民服务观点。在进行戏改工作中许多戏曲界的代表人物如梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬等先生，都积极参加，而且领导了戏曲改革工作。但是全国的戏曲工作，除了它的成绩之外，也存在着许多问题，尚须改正，如关于贯彻戏改的方针政策问题，有些地区由于对中央戏改方针政策不甚明了，在处理问题时不免发生偏差。最突出的是禁戏问题。如在东北、徐州、晋南等地曾因禁戏过多，不仅不能适应群众需要，并使艺人发生生活困难，后已纠正。第二，关于剧本编审供应问题，目前对于剧本的创作和修改都做得不够。解决剧本荒也是当前重要的课题。第三，关于曲艺界制度改革问题，如旧剧界过去存在的徒弟制度，养女制度……均须有步骤、有计划地加以处理。最后关于旧艺人的教育改造问题，除在政治思想教育方面有了一定的收获外，因专门干部缺乏，尚未能全部贯彻到业务上去。以上这些问题，经过这次大会的召开，当会获得进一步的改进。
    出席这次大会的有中央人民政府文化部代表，各大行政区及北京、上海等四十七个省市的戏曲改革工作干部和各种戏剧、曲艺工作者的代表以及新音乐新戏剧工作者的代表共二百余人。文化部部长沈雁冰在开幕词中要求全国三十五万戏曲工作者更进一步地团结起来，共同推动戏曲改造工作，创造出新的优良的民族的大众的文艺形式，以负起中国人民政协共同纲领所要求的艺术为人民服务，启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情这一光辉的任务。政务院文化教育委员会马叙伦副主任、胡乔木秘书长和中央人民政府文化部周扬副部长、戏曲工作者代表梅兰芳、张德成（川剧老伶工）、欧阳予倩、周信芳、程砚秋、盖叫天、连阔如等也都讲了话。
    在今天抗美援朝保家卫国运动的高潮中，会议的召开更具有重大的意义。正像大会上许多代表热烈的发言中所提出的，戏曲界要在这一运动中发挥全部的力量完成这一光荣的任务。如梅兰芳先生在大会的发言中坚决表示：“我有一个愿望，在今天全国人民普遍掀起抗美援朝保家卫国的高潮之下，我们戏曲界要拿出我们所有的力量，在舞台上、在街头、在广场、在广播里用各种不同的方式进行深入而广泛的宣传，以配合这一正义运动。”周信芳先生的发言中也热情地保证将此次大会中以抗美援朝保家卫国的任务贯彻到戏曲界中去。
