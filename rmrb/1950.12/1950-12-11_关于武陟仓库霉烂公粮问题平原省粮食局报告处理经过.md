To the Editors:

After reading Comrade Zhang Lianfeng's article in the September 1st "People's Garden" exposing the mold and rot of grain in the Wuzhi warehouse and requesting relevant departments to find a solution, we immediately dispatched personnel together with the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office to Wuzhi for inspection. According to the inspection results, the mold and insect infestation situation was as follows: The surface of the rice in general granaries was infested with insects to a thickness of almost one finger or more, and in individual granaries, due to dampness from the walls, moisture had entered the grain, resulting in mold, rot, sourness, and off-flavors. For example, in the South Big Granary of Mulandiandian, more than one hundred catties of grain close to the wall, about one foot high and one and a half fingers thick, had deteriorated and turned white due to wall dampness, with a moldy sour and unpleasant smell. The surface layer of rice stored in the Xiaozhai agent warehouse was infested with insects, with an estimated damage of over two hundred catties of rice. The color and smell of the rice stored in the remaining warehouses had no major changes and was still edible, but due to seasonal factors, the quality was not as good as new rice.

The above situation shows that although the degree of insect infestation and mold damage in the county's stored rice differs from the specific situation reported by Comrade Zhang Lianfeng, the fact that public grain has been damaged has been established. Therefore, we believe that Comrade Zhang's attitude of taking serious responsibility for state property and exposing the problems existing in our work has not only promoted our work but also has great educational significance for all our grain workers. We immediately ordered the district warehouse to make appropriate handling according to the mold damage and insect infestation situation: In addition to the spoiled grain, it should be sold through supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase native cloth or cotton, which the cooperative will use to repay the grain periodically, and an agreement should be signed with the cooperative to lend it to the masses, who will repay it periodically. At the same time, the responsibility of the personnel involved should be investigated and education should be strengthened.

We believe that the main reason for this phenomenon of harming state property is that our leadership's work is not thorough, we do not understand the situation below, and we have not adequately educated the custodians on a daily basis, they lack a sense of responsibility, the inspection work is not thorough, or effective measures are not taken promptly upon discovering problems, which has contributed to the development of losses. At the same time, some grain workers in the county do not have a sufficient understanding of completing the two major tasks of storage and supply, and therefore have the idea of pushing the job away after finishing the calculation. For example, after the occurrence of mold and insect infestation, they did not actively use effective methods such as processing and turning over to salvage or handle the grain and recover the losses. Instead, some even mixed the spoiled grain with the good grain as supply expenditure and distributed it to grain-consuming departments (The People's Daily previously received letters from cadres in the Jiaozuo mining area, talking about the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Bureau using bad grain as supply grain expenditure, as well as similar things. The Pingyuan Grain Bureau should conduct a thorough review and handle it reasonably. – Editor). In order to reduce formal digital losses and shirk their own responsibilities. As a result, not only has the loss of public grain not been compensated, but it has also affected the supply, leading to dissatisfaction from grain-consuming departments. This error must be corrected in the future.

### 关于武陟仓库霉烂公粮问题平原省粮食局报告处理经过

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    关于武陟仓库霉烂公粮问题平原省粮食局报告处理经过编辑同志：
    读了九月一日《人民园地》登载的张连峰同志揭发武陟仓库粮食霉烂并提请有关部门设法处理的意见后，我们当即派员会同新乡专署前往武陟检查。据检查结果，霉烂生虫情况是：一般米仓浮面生虫将近一指或一指多厚，并有个别仓房由于墙壁反潮，水份侵入粮内，已有霉烂发酸变味情况发生。如木栾店南大仓内，贴近墙壁地方有一尺多高、一指半厚的一百余斤粮食，因受墙潮已变质发白色，霉酸有邪味。小寨代库存米浮面一层生虫，约计损伤米二百余斤。其余各仓存米，色泽气味无大变化，仍可食用，但因季节性的关系，其质量已不如新米好。
    以上情况说明，该县存米发生生虫霉损情况程度虽与张连峰同志报道之具体情况尚有出入，然确已构成公粮受损的事实。故我们认为张同志能以对国家财产采取认真负责的态度，揭发了我们工作中存在的问题，除对我们的工作起了推动作用外，同时对我全体粮食工作同志是有很大教育意义的。我们当即令区库根据霉损生虫情况作适当的处理：除坏粮外，通过供销合作社出售购成土布或棉花，由合作社定期还粮，并与合作社订立协议贷给群众，分别定期归还。同时并追查有关人员责任和加强教育。
    我们认为产生这种危害国家财产现象的主要原因，是由于我们领导上工作不深入，不了解下情，加之素日对保管人员教育不够，缺乏工作责任心，检查工作不深入，或发现问题不迅速采取有效措施，致助长了损失现象的发展。同时，由于该县部分粮食工作同志对完成保管和供给两大任务的认识不足，因之存有推手算完事的思想，如霉烂生虫现象发生后，不去主动积极地用加工、翻晒等有效办法抢救或进行处理，挽回损失，而竟有的将坏粮掺在好粮内，作为供给开支，发给吃粮部门（本报前曾收到焦作工矿干部来信，谈到平原省粮食局以坏粮作供给粮开支，以及类似的事，平原粮食局应进行深刻检讨并合理处理。——编者）以求得减少形式数字的损失与推卸自身应负的责任。结果不惟公粮损失未得到补救，且影响了供给，招致了吃粮部门不满。这种错误今后必须纠正。
