Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 25th: The victorious news of the large-scale counter-offensive by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean front and the recovery of Pyongyang has aroused enthusiastic cheers among the commanders and fighters of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. The Headquarters Political Department of the Southwest Military Region held a celebration meeting of more than 3,000 people on the afternoon of the 9th. Li Da, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region, said in his speech that the historical and great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army not only powerfully demonstrates once again that American imperialism is just a paper tiger, but also shows that the power of the world's people who are awakened and united can defeat any fierce enemy. Yuan Kezhong and other model representatives attending the National Congress of Heroes and Model Workers expressed that they would improve their military technology and political and cultural level and do their current work well to oppose American aggression and defend the motherland.

The soldiers of various departments wrote letters to express their condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. The People's Fighters Newspaper of the Military Region received 283 letters of condolence in one week. These letters were filled with boundless love and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. More than 500 hero models who participated in the congratulatory conference of the Western Sichuan Military Region firmly expressed in their letters that they would oppose American imperialism with practical actions of actively participating in consolidating national defense and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Engineers also drew many cartoons on the letters of condolence. One picture shows two giant hands tightly clasped, symbolizing the close combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Luo Li and three other students from the First Detachment of the Military and Political University wrote in a letter: "Dear comrades, you have the heroic Korean People's Guerrilla forces in front to meet you, and the peace-loving people of the world behind you as a backing, you are invincible!" Xu Jing'an, a student of the teaching regiment, compared the great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and Wu Xiuquan's just accusation at the United Nations to two sharp blades inserted into the heart of the American aggressors in a letter of condolence. Cheng Daoju, a soldier from the Motor Vehicle Regiment of the Logistics Department, attached a letter of condolence to the condolence bag, which read: "In order to express my love and respect for you, I personally sewed a condolence bag for you, and made a pair of shoes and a pair of socks to give to you. I sincerely hope that you will kill more American robbers."

    欢庆朝鲜大捷慰问抗美战士
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线大举反攻和光复平壤的胜利消息，在人民解放军西南军区指战员中间引起了热烈的欢呼。西南军区司令部政治部于九日下午举行了三千余人的庆祝大会。西南军区李达副司令员在讲话中说：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军这次历史性的伟大胜利不但再次有力地说明美帝国主义是只纸老虎，而且说明觉悟和团结起来的世界人民力量，是可以战胜任何凶恶的敌人的。出席全国英雄模范代表会议的英模代表、袁克忠等表示要提高军事技术和政治、文化水平，做好当前工作，来反对美国侵略、保卫祖国。
    各部战士纷纷写信慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。军区人民战士报社在一周内即收到二百八十三封慰问信。这些信洋溢着对中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军无比热爱和尊敬的感情。参加川西军区贺功大会的五百余英雄模范在信中坚决表示要以积极参加巩固国防、巩固人民民主专政的实际行动，反对美帝国主义。工兵们在慰问信上还画着很多漫画。有一幅画着两只紧紧握着的巨手，象征中朝人民亲密无间的战斗友谊。军政大学一总队学员罗丽等四人在信上写着：“亲爱的同志们，你们的前面有英勇的朝鲜人民游击队接应，后面有全世界爱好和平的人民作后盾，你们是所向无敌的！”教导团学员徐静庵在慰问信中把朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利和伍修权代表在联合国的正义控告比喻为插进美国侵略者的心脏的两把利刃。后勤部汽车团战士成刀巨在慰问袋里附上一封慰问信，信上写着：“为了表示我对你们的敬爱的心意，我亲手给你们缝了一个慰问袋，并做了一双鞋子、一双袜子送给你们。我热烈地希望你们多杀几个美国强盗。”
