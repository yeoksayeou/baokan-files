The rooms connecting to the left and right sides of the conference hall, in addition to accommodating the delegation and the news reporters' offices, radio stations, film studios, and a dozen shops selling books,大会照片,波兰玩具和纪念品的十来个铺子以外, relating to the movement to defend peace and other literary and political works, conference photos, Polish toys, and souvenirs, the vast halls were used for exhibitions. The Soviet Union and China both had photo exhibitions about the peace movement and their national construction endeavors. The audience flipped through the Chinese people's peace signature books, excitedly reading the huge numbers of signatories to the Stockholm Appeal. The Polish exhibition included two parts: the economic and cultural construction of People's Democratic Poland and the post-war reconstruction of Warsaw and other cities. Large photos eloquently showed Hitler's bestial bombing and destruction, and the great achievements of the Polish people's construction efforts.

Of great interest to the delegates was the exhibition of satirical cartoons from European and American countries. Behind glass screens stood political cartoons by artists from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the United States, Mexico, Japan... Whether from people's democratic countries, capitalist countries, or colonial countries, their merciless pens unanimously pointed to the noses of the enemies of world peace - Truman's pointed nose, Bevin's big nose, Churchill's pug nose...

We saw a huge tank army with its head raised, and crouching in the shadow under the vehicle was a family: a man, a woman holding a child, and a bed. Beside them, Truman was singing: "I promise every American a roof over their head."

Here again was Truman, in the White House with Acheson, and senior army and navy officers examining a rather mysterious wooden box equipped with gears and levers. A "scientist" presenting the box stood beside them. Truman asked, "What is this called?" The scientist said, "It doesn't have a name yet." "What is it for?" "It's useless." "Then why are you showing it to me?" "Because the Soviet Union doesn't have it yet."

The title and description of each painting were written in four to six languages.

The so-called "Voice of America" was also a subject of condemnation by cartoonists from several countries. An Iranian artist clearly pointed out that the "Voice of America" was a big capitalist pulling a noose under a killing gallows, while opening his bloody mouth to roar. A Polish artist used bombers in the sky, bombs, and a mother and frightened daughter in a house to express this theme. The description was: "Mommy, I'm afraid of that voice." "Child, that's the 'Voice of America'!"

Some countries that act as running dogs for the United States were also frequent targets of satire. In the center was an American money box, surrounded by a group of gentlemen in tailcoats asking for money. You could tell that was Attlee, that was Schuman, and there were Franco and Tito, etc. The title: "We are all free countries."

Another painting: two people in formal attire escorted a thief-like guy, that was Franco. This guilty Spanish murderer asked, "Are you taking me to Nuremberg?" "No, taking you to Lake Success."

The US imperialist armed aggression against Korea was also a common theme. An indignant American worker, with a bayonet against his back, was forced to be cannon fodder. MacArthur, the war criminal, was trapped in the mountain of knives and forest of spears of the Korean people. An American monopoly capitalist held an axe dripping with blood, with a United Nations flag tied around his waist as an apron. American soldiers lost their lives in Korea, while the profits of the American military-industrial big bosses increased more and more.

In another scene, the chieftains of the "North Atlantic Treaty" were meeting around a table. The curtain was lifted, revealing a familiar face: a small mustache, a tuft of hair on his forehead. That ghost said to them, "Comrades, I heard you are missing a commander, aren't you?"

The sharp and incisive brush of the famous American progressive artist William Gropper revealed the fascist essence of the American rulers and conveyed the voices of resistance from the American people. From the terrorist tactics of openly active secret police to the secretly conducted thought control and deceptive policies of fooling the people, things were intensifying in America. People's lives were deteriorating further with the progress of the war of aggression. A family, old and young, male and female, sat around a table drinking a pot of soup, but a big hand stretched down from the air, with a big spoon in its hand reaching into the pot. Men, women, and children all looked up at this big spoon – the Truman government.

As I was looking at a cartoon about the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns, a young black American man came up to me and chatted. He said sarcastically, "There are big differences between the Democratic and Republican parties. When the Republicans in Congress advocate that we should be arrested today, the Democrats object and say that we should be arrested tomorrow." That cartoon on the wall also exposed the lie that "American and British parliamentary politics are democratic politics." The painting showed two Americans attacking each other in front of two ballot boxes (one Democrat, one Republican), gnashing their teeth, and each casting their own vote. But the two pipes under the two boxes led to the end, merging into one. The two ballots fell into the same upturned top hat!

Cartoons exposing the anti-peace activities of the reactionary governments of the United States and Britain and their lackeys, and their persecution of peace fighters, were everywhere in the exhibition. Although the dove of peace, holding an olive branch in its mouth, was threatened by bayonets, it still flew bravely. Workers in people's democratic countries poured molten iron from the furnace, the title was: "Increase production, defend peace." A girl drew a dove, and the mother beside her saw it and said in horror: "Tear it up quickly, they will put you in jail, this is red propaganda!" Big-bellied capitalists sat in the house, and when a dove flew past the window, they hysterically shouted: "Spy! Spy!" How powerfully this painting expressed the imperialists' fear of peace!

In his report, Chairman Guo Moruo refuted the shameless lies of Acheson, Stuart, Austin and others that American imperialism was a good friend of China. The eyes of the unfooled people in capitalist countries were also sharp. A painting by a French artist depicted American bombs falling on Chinese territory, slaughtering Chinese children, with the title: "America is a good friend of China!"

The satirical puppet boxes specially made for the conference by the Warsaw National Puppet Theater also attracted the attention of many delegates. This form of expression was very novel and perhaps could provide Chinese artists with a reference. I remember one box was a group of men and women, each holding a piece of land marked with the names of France, Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia, etc., waiting by the roadside to be sold. Truman walked down the road carrying a wallet. The title was: "In the Western European Market." In another scene, Truman sat behind a large desk, with a stenographer who looked like Lie sitting at a small table opposite him. She was faithfully waiting for orders. Another stage scene revealed and satirized the British Labor government's conspiracy to refuse visas and ban the World Congress from being held in Britain: Bevin guarded the gate of the British Empire, refusing the delegates from afar, saying: "My master does not allow it." Who was his master? Truman's head appeared in the window of that building.

Soviet satirical paintings were also displayed in the Soviet exhibition. We have seen the works of famous artists such as Kukryniksy, Yefimov... in the Crocodile magazine or in Chinese newspapers (reprinted and with Chinese captions), but this time we appreciated their colored originals.

In addition, it is impossible not to mention the American children's toy exhibition.

In the loft of the corridor on the right side of the conference hall, several glass cabinets displayed some samples of American children's toys. These toys fully demonstrated how the American imperialists painstakingly tried to make the American people accept the fascist education of the rulers from their childhood, to poison their pure and innocent minds from an early age, to cultivate their habits of bloodthirst and belligerence, so that they could obediently become their tools of aggression when they grow up.

Here were dark green tanks, amphibious tanks for two-story troops, submarines, and arrows marked as "atomic flying arrows." There were also jet planes that could "shoot sparks due to friction" and submachine guns that said they "can be filled with water and then released, reaching several feet away." There was a fighter plane, the advertisement on the cardboard box said, that when the engine was running at full speed, it would "scream, cut through the floor, and sparks would shoot out from the front of the plane, very terrifying." There were also cars painted with the words "Military Police" and police cars with machine guns mounted on them. Most shocking was a pair of small tin handcuffs suitable for delicate little hands to wear! Next to the various pistols was also a black mask for disguise!

Under such children's education, the Wall Street Hitlers trained a group of pilots who drove planes to strafe Korean farmers in the fields and the two-year-old children in their arms, trained a group of bombers who destroyed entire cities with 40,000 to 50,000 incendiary bombs, and trained a group of robbers who robbed property like the German Kou and then "sent packages home." From playing with children's toys to reading detective novels, listening to the radio, and appreciating Hollywood movies, the American people were constantly deceived, anesthetized, and poisoned by a series of propaganda for wars of aggression, so that some deceived people gradually lost some of the ordinary moral concepts possessed by kind human beings, making them cruel and barbaric, able to perform any evil deeds happily; so that they would no longer be surprised if they heard these words: "We should bomb Chinese cities and villages" (Republican Congressman Nolan) "The sacred threat of the atomic bomb must be used" (Washington Standard) "Only massive bombing of Manchuria can awaken China" (Christian Science Monitor). In newspapers, on the radio, they listened to this crazy delirium; in cradles, in kindergartens, they played with such weapons of mass murder, robber masks, and handcuffs and police cars for suppressing the people's resistance. What a dark and criminal country!

This American children's toy exhibition specifically confirmed the speech of Soviet representative Ehrenburg: "Murderers are not created in an hour, murderers are cultivated and trained from childhood. American children's magazines publish many humorous drawings... praising the behavior of Ilse Koch (the female head of the Nazi concentration camp who liked to make lampshades from human skin - quoted) who skinned people alive... suggesting that children play with the pistols of the Falangists (the Spanish fascist organization - quoted) and the Nazi SS. No one will doubt what these children will do when they develop toys into real weapons."

What they did was: "Yesterday, the mighty American warship Missouri fired more than 800,000 pounds of death and destruction shells at military targets in the city of Chongjin at a rate of 15,000 pounds of shells per minute..." What they did was the bloody crimes in those Korean photos at another exhibition at the conference! The American-Li bandit army cut off the heads of twelve Korean farmers and put them on bricks for public display. What they did was to destroy the entire prosperous city, leaving only three houses. What they did was what their masters did in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw seven years ago, on a bright May day. In the exhibition pictures of the reconstruction of Warsaw at the conference, we saw the bustling streets of the Jewish quarter of Warsaw before the war, with mothers pushing strollers in the garden; we also saw that in less than a month, the entire area became a scorched earth, and only some white lines in the photos could tell people that 300,000 people once lived here.

However, the fascist atrocities of American imperialism and the propaganda of new wars to carry out such atrocities have been opposed by the people of the world, including the American people. Women in New York recently gathered to oppose the forced indoctrination of children with atomic bombs and war hysteria in schools. The proposal put forward by the Chinese people to condemn war instigator MacArthur, and the proposal put forward by the Soviet people to prohibit the propaganda of new wars, have been unanimously adopted by the Second World Congress and formulated as a peace program. Every righteous speech at the conference, whether it was by the people of the aggressor country or the people of the invaded country, firmly opposed the American war of aggression. Every eloquent photo, every biting cartoon, as well as those satirical puppets and those American toys that incited murder, also exposed the hideous face of the new Hitler. Now, the brilliant victory of the Chinese and Korean people in resisting American aggression has further exposed the fragile essence of the new Hitler. The doomsday of the war criminals will not be far away.

    战犯面目的暴露
    第二届世界和大记事之三
    本报随和大代表团记者袁水拍
    连接大会会议厅的左右两侧的屋子里，除了容纳代表团和各国新闻记者办公室、无线电台、电影场、出售有关保卫和平运动及其他文艺和政治书籍、大会照片、波兰玩具和纪念品的十来个铺子以外，广大的穿堂都供作展览会之用。苏联和中国都有关于和运和本国建设事业的图片展览。观众翻阅着中国人民的和平签名册，兴奋地念着我们在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名者的巨额数字。波兰的展览包括两部分：人民民主波兰的经济、文化建设事业和华沙及其他城市的战后复兴重建工作。大幅照片雄辩地显示出希特勒的兽性的轰炸破坏，和波兰人民建设事业的伟大成就。
    引起大会代表们极大兴趣的是欧洲和美洲各国的讽刺漫画展览。立在地上的玻璃屏风里，张挂着波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、美国、墨西哥、日本……各国美术家的辛辣的政治漫画。无论是人民民主国家，资本主义国家，或者殖民地国家的画家们，他们的无情的笔尖都一致地指向世界和平的敌人的鼻子——杜鲁门的尖鼻子、贝文的大鼻子邱吉尔的哈巴狗鼻子……。
    我们看见一辆翘起头的巨大的坦克军，蜷缩在车子下面的阴影里的是一个家庭：男人、抱孩子的女人和床。旁边杜鲁门在高唱：“我答应每一个美国人的头上有一个屋顶。”
    这里又是杜鲁门，他在白宫里和艾奇逊、陆军和海军高级军官们审视一只外形颇为神秘的配备着齿轮、杠杆的木箱。旁边站着一个献箱的“科学家”。杜鲁门问道：“这叫什么东西？”那科学家说：“还没有名字。”“它有什么用么？”“毫无用处。”“那你为什么给我看？”“因为这东西苏联还没有。”
    每一幅画的标题和说明都是用四种到六种文字写的。
    所谓“美国之音”也是好几个国家的漫画家加以笔伐的题材。伊朗的画家清楚地指出“美国之音”就是一个大资本家在杀人的绞架下一边拉着绞索，一边张开血盆大口嘶叫。波兰的画家用天空的轰炸机、炸弹、屋子里的妈妈和受惊的女儿来表现这个题材。说明是：“妈妈，我害怕这声音。”“孩子，这就是‘美国之音’啊！”
    给美国当走狗的一些国家也是经常被讽刺的对象。中间一只美国的钱箱，四周是一群要钱的穿燕尾服的绅士。你看得出这是艾德礼，那是舒曼，还有佛朗哥和铁托等等。标题：《我们都是自由的国家。》
    另一幅画：两个穿大礼服的人押送一个小偷似的家伙，那是佛朗哥。这个心虚的西班牙的杀人犯问道：“你们是不是带我到纽伦堡去？”“不，带你到成功湖。”
    美帝武装侵略朝鲜也是一个常见的题材。一个愤懑的美国工人，背后被枪尖抵着，被迫去当炮灰。麦克阿瑟这战争罪犯陷入了朝鲜人民的刀山剑林中。美国独占资本家手里拿一把滴着鲜血的斧子，腰里缚一块用联合国旗子做的围裙。美国士兵在朝鲜丧失生命，美国军火工业大老板的利润却越来越增加。
    在另一幅画面上，“北大西洋公约”的匪首们围着桌子在开会，门帘掀处，探进一个熟悉的面孔：小胡子，额上一撮头发。那幽灵向他们这样说：“伙伴们，听说你们还少一个统帅，是吗？”
    著名的美国进步画家威廉·格鲁伯的泼刺犀利的画笔揭发着美国统治者的法西斯的本质，也传达着美国人民反抗的呼声。从公开活动的特务警察的恐怖手段到暗中进行的思想控制和蒙蔽欺骗的愚民政策，正在美国变本加厉地进行着。人民的生活随着侵略战争的进行而更加恶化。一家老少男女围在桌旁喝一锅子汤，可是空中伸下来一只大手，手里的大调羹已经伸进锅子。男人、女人和小孩子一起抬头看这只大调羹——杜鲁门政府。
    当我正在看一幅关于民主党和共和党竞选的漫画时，旁边一个美国青年黑人走来和我攀谈，他讥讽地说：“民主党和共和党是有很大的不同的。当共和党在议会里主张今天就把我们逮捕起来的时候，民主党就提出反对的意见，他们说，应该在明天把我们逮捕起来。”那幅壁上的漫画也同样拆穿了“美英议会政治是民主政治”的谎话。画上两个美国人在两个投票箱（一个民主党，一个共和党）前互相攻击，咬牙切齿，各人投各人的票。可是两只箱子底下的两根管子通到尽头，却合而为一。两张票子落进了同一只翻转的大礼帽！
    暴露美英反动政府及其仆从们反对和平，迫害和平斗士们的漫画，在展览会中到处可见。口衔橄榄叶的和平鸽子虽则遭受刺刀的威胁，但它还是勇敢地飞翔着。人民民主国家的工人倾倒着熔炉里的铁浆，标题是：《增加生产，保卫和平。》一个女孩子画了一只鸽子，旁边的妈妈看见了，惊惶地说：“快扯去，他们会把你关进监狱去，这是赤色宣传！”大肚子的资本家们坐在屋子里，窗外有一只鸽子飞过，他们就歇斯底里地狂呼：“奸细！奸细！”这幅画多么有力地表现了帝国主义者对和平的害怕啊！
    郭沫若团长在他的报告里驳斥了艾奇逊、司徒雷登、奥斯汀之流的美帝国主义是中国的好朋友的无耻谰言。资本主义国家内不受欺骗的人民的眼睛也是雪亮的。一幅法国艺术家的画这样画着：美国炸弹降落在中国领土上屠杀中国儿童，标题是：《美国是中国的好朋友！》
    受到很多代表注意的，还有华沙国立木偶剧场特为大会制作的几箱讽刺画式的木偶。这个表现形式很新鲜也许可以提供中国的美术家们作参考。我记得一只箱子里是一群男女，各人手里拿着标明法、意、西班牙、南斯拉夫等国名的一块国土，他们都在路边等待出卖。杜鲁门提着钱包在路上走。标题是：《在西欧市场上。》在另一场面里，杜鲁门在一张大办公桌后面坐着，在他对面的一张小桌旁坐着一个脸孔像赖伊的女速记员。她正在忠诚地候命。把英国工党政府拒绝签证、禁止和大在英举行的阴谋，加以揭露与讽刺的，是另一幅舞台面：贝文在大英帝国门口守门，拒绝远道来的和大代表们进去，他说：“我的主人不允许。”他的主人是谁呢？那楼窗口露出了杜鲁门的脑袋。
    苏联的讽刺画另外在苏联的展览会中陈列。著名的库克里尼克赛、叶菲莫夫……等画家的作品，我们已经在鳄鱼报上，或在中国报刊上（经过翻印并加中文说明的）看见过不少，可是这次我们欣赏到了他们的彩色原稿。
    此外，不能不提的是美国儿童玩具展览。
    在会议厅右侧穿堂的阁楼上，几只玻璃柜里陈列着一些美国儿童玩具的标本。这些玩具充分说明了美帝国主义者怎样处心积虑地企图使美国人民从他们幼年时代起就接受统治者的法西斯教育，使他们纯洁天真的心灵从小就被毒化，使他们养成嗜杀好战的习性，长大起来可以乖乖地做他们的侵略工具。
    这里有暗绿色的坦克、两楼部队的水陆两用坦克、潜水艇和标明为“原子飞箭”的飞箭。还有能够“因摩擦而喷射火星”的喷气式飞机，说明“可以把水装进去，然后放射出去，能达几尺远”的冲锋枪。有一种战斗机，那纸匣上的广告说道，如果开足机器跑的时候，会“尖声地叫着，穿过地板，一面飞机头上会放射火星，非常恐怖”。另外还有一种漆着“军事警察”的白字的汽车和架着机关枪的警车。最触目惊心的是一副适宜于细嫩小手备戴的小型白铁手铐！在各式手枪旁边还放着一副蒙面用的黑色面具！
    在这样的儿童教育下，华尔街的希特勒训练出一批驾着飞机扫射田野里的朝鲜农妇和她手里的两岁孩子的飞行员，训练出一批用四万颗至五万颗烧夷弹毁灭整个城市的轰炸手，训练出一批和德寇一样抢劫财物然后“将包裹寄回国去”的盗匪。从玩弄儿童玩具起，一直到看滑稽连环画、读侦探小说、听无线电、欣赏好莱乌电影，美国人民经常不息地被一系列的侵略战争的宣传所欺骗，麻醉和毒害，使一部分受骗的人逐渐失去善良人类所具备的一些普通的道德观念，使他们变得残忍野蛮，任何罪恶行为都能胜任愉快地去干；使他们再也不致惊怪，如果他们听到了这些话：“我们应该轰炸中国的城市和乡村”，（共和党议员诺兰）“必须运用原子弹的神圣的威胁。”（《华盛顿标准报》）“只有大举轰炸满洲才能使中国清醒。”（《基督教科学箴言报》）在报纸上，在收音机里，他们听着这种疯狂的呓语；在摇篮里，幼稚园里，他们玩着这种大规模杀人的武器，盗匪的面具和镇压国内人民反抗的手铐和警车。这是多么黑暗和充满罪恶的国家！
    这个美国儿童玩具展览具体地证实了苏联代表爱伦堡的发言：“杀人犯并不是在一个钟头之内造成的，杀人犯是从儿童时代教养和训练出来的。美国的各种儿童杂志上刊载着许多滑稽画……歌颂活剥人皮的伊尔萨·科赫（纳粹集中营女头子，爱把人皮做灯罩——引用者）的行为。……建议儿童玩长枪党员（西班牙的法西斯组织——引用者）和纳粹党卫军的手枪。任何人都不会怀疑，当这些儿童把玩具进展到真正武器的时候，他们会干出什么事来。”
    他们所干的就是：“美国强大的战舰密苏里号昨日以每分钟一万五千磅炮弹的速率在一小时内向清津城的军事目标发射了八十万磅以上的死亡与毁灭的炮弹……”他们所干的就是在大会另一展览会中的那些朝鲜照片上的血腥罪行！美李兽军把十二个朝鲜农民的头割下来放在砖上示众。他们所干的就是把整个繁荣的城市毁灭得只剩三所房子。他们所干的也就是七年前，在一个明媚的五月，他们的师傅们在华沙的犹太区所干的。在大会的华沙重建的展览图片上，我们看见了战前华沙犹太区的热闹市街，母亲推着童车在花园里；我们也看见了在不到一个月内，整个区域变成了一片焦土，照片上只有一些白色的线条还能告诉人，这儿曾经住过三十万人。
    但是美帝国主义的法西斯暴行和为了进行这种暴行而作的新战争的宣传，已经遭到全世界人民的反对，连美国人民也包括在内。纽约的妇女最近曾集会反对在学校中对儿童强硬灌输原子弹和战争歇斯底里的宣传。中国人民所提的谴责战争挑拨者麦克阿瑟的提案，苏联人民所提的禁止新战争宣传的提案，已获得二届和大的一致通过，制订为和平纲领。大会上每一个正义的发言，无论他是侵略国家的人民或是被侵略国家的人民，都坚决反对美国的侵略战争。大会上所展览的每一张雄辩的照片、每一幅辛辣的漫画，以及那些讽刺性的木偶和那些教唆杀人的美国玩具，也同样暴露了新希特勒的狰狞面目。现在，中朝两国人民反抗美国侵略的辉煌胜利更揭穿了新希特勒的脆弱的本质。战犯们的末日是不会很远了。
