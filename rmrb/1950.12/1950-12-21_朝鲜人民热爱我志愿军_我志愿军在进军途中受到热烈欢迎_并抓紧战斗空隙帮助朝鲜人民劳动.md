Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 20th – Our correspondent with the Chinese People's Volunteers reports: The Korean people are loving and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers with unparalleled joy. Along the roads where our People's Volunteers advance, and on the mountain walls and walls along the way, slogans such as "Long Live the People's Republic of China," "Long Live Mao Zedong," "Long Live the Chinese People's Volunteers," and "Long Live the Friendship and Unity Between the Chinese and Korean People" are written everywhere. When our People's Volunteers pass through villages and towns, sometimes in the middle of the night, the local people still prepare hot water to welcome and send them off. They carry bucket after bucket of hot water to the soldiers, asking everyone to drink some hot water to quench their thirst and keep warm. Some Korean people also prepare food to entertain them, and when the soldiers decline, they always insist that they accept it. When the troops bivouac, the Korean people always try their best to heat the houses warmly so that the soldiers can sleep comfortably. The hosts often quietly leave after taking care of the soldiers until they fall asleep. Sometimes when the soldiers bivouac in mountain caves, the local people also try their best to find some grass for them to spread out.

The Korean people are also actively supporting our People's Volunteers in advancing. In the bone-chillingly cold Korean nights, tens of thousands of Korean people are repairing hundreds of kilometers of mountain roads. Among the crowds are elderly elders, women, and students. In order to quickly transport the troops' supplies and weapons to the front, they brave the severe cold and fill the uneven roads with shovels and hoes in the mountains.

The impeccable mass discipline of our People's Volunteers deeply moves the Korean people. Once, when the troops entered a village, all the residents went to the mountain沟 (gully) to hide from the planes. Although the troops were freezing and tired, they still endured the fatigue and slept under the eaves of the people's houses or on the haystacks, and no one entered the people's houses. When the people returned from the mountains and saw the troops sleeping outside, they were both moved and admired. The Korean people, who have suffered from the enemy's brutal bombing and the looting and slaughter of the bandit troops, live in very difficult conditions. Our People's Volunteers seize every combat break to help them with their work. The soldiers help them fetch water, chop firewood, and carry out other labor. The troops always sweep the courtyards they live in clean. The firewood used by the troops is also gathered by themselves in the mountains, and the grain, oil, salt, and vegetables they eat are all brought by themselves. Sometimes the people send pickles and insist that the soldiers eat them, so they temporarily accept them and return them as they were after they finish eating. Once, a soldier was washing clothes when an old woman saw him, and she insisted on taking them to wash. Her two teenage daughters picked up the basin and ran, scrambling to wash them. When the soldier thanked them, the old woman said, "There is no need to thank us for washing some clothes for our benefactors!"

When the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army meet, the two people's troops are as happy as friends who have known each other for a long time. Everyone sticks out their thumbs, praising each other's bravery and good fighting skills, congratulating each other on their victories, and saluting each other with their guns. The Korean People's Army on guard posts along the way all salute our People's Volunteers who are marching forward.

    朝鲜人民热爱我志愿军
    我志愿军在进军途中受到热烈欢迎
    并抓紧战斗空隙帮助朝鲜人民劳动
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十日电】本社随中国人民志愿军通讯员报道：朝鲜人民正以无比的欢愉心情热爱和支援中国人民志愿军。在我人民志愿军前进的道路上，在沿途的山壁和墙壁上到处都写着“中华人民共和国万岁”、“毛泽东万岁”、“中国人民志愿军万岁”、“中朝人民友谊团结万岁”等标语。我国人民志愿军路过村镇时，有时是在深夜，可是当地老百姓仍预备好热开水接待迎送。他们将一桶一桶的热水抬到战士们的面前，要大家喝点热水解渴取暖。有些朝鲜老百姓还准备好食物招待，当被战士们谢绝时，他们总是坚决地要求收下。部队宿营时，朝鲜的老百姓总是尽量把屋子烧得暖暖的，使战士们睡得舒服。主人们时常在照料战士们睡着之后，才悄悄地走开。有时战士们在山洞内宿营，当地老百姓也尽量地设法寻找些草给他们铺上。
    朝鲜人民还积极地支援我国人民志愿军向前进军。在冰寒刺骨的朝鲜长夜里，成千上万的朝鲜人民在整修着山区中绵亘数百公里长的公路线。人群中有年老的长者、有妇女和学生。为了使部队的辎重、武器迅速地运向前方，他们冒着严寒，在山区中一锹一镐地填着凹凸不平的道路。
    我国人民志愿军秋毫无犯的群众纪律，深深地感动了朝鲜人民。有一次部队走进了一个村庄，居民们全部进山沟躲飞机去了，部队虽然是又冻又累，但仍然忍受着疲乏，睡在老百姓的屋檐下或草垛上，没有一个人走进老百姓的屋子里去。老百姓从山上回来，看见部队睡在外面，他们是又感动又钦佩。遭受敌机残酷轰炸和匪军抢劫、屠杀后的朝鲜人民，生活很困苦。我国人民志愿军抓紧了战斗空隙帮助他们干活。战士们帮助他们打水、打柴和进行其他的劳动。部队总是把住的院子打扫得干干净净的。部队用的烧柴，也都是自己上山打的，吃的粮油盐菜也都是自己带来的。有时老百姓送来咸菜，一定要战士们吃，他们就暂时收下，等吃完了饭，再原物送还他们。有一次，一个战士正在洗濯衣服，给一个老太太看见了，她非要抢去洗不可。她的两个十几岁的小姑娘端起盆就跑，抢着给洗了。这个战士向她们道谢时，老太太说：“为我们的恩人洗点衣服，还用得着谢！”
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军遇见时，两支人民部队像早就相识的朋友一样，高兴得不得了。大家都伸着大拇指，互相称赞着彼此的英勇善战，祝贺着胜利，就互相举枪致敬。沿途岗哨上的朝鲜人民军，都向行进着的我国人民志愿军举枪敬礼。
