    Labor Hero and Production Model Zhang Shuyi
    Writes to Chairman Mao

    Dear Chairman Mao:
    I have kept in mind all the words you spoke at the National Model Workers Conference. I am determined to respond to your concern with achievements in intensified production and diligent study. Currently, American imperialism is waging a war of aggression in Korea and attempting to invade our country. All of us in our group have unanimously expressed our desire to redouble our production efforts and strive to ensure that all 29 households in the group achieve a "cultivate two, surplus one" status starting next year, in order to support the war against American aggression in Korea. I have now learned 150 new characters, and with my previous foundation, I can understand the general meaning of simple notices. There are three people's schools in our village. The Liangqiangou People's School has been open for a month under my supervision. In terms of production, the 29 households in my work group have produced 30 circles of manure, totaling 4,460 loads. We have now begun transporting it to the fields to free up time for land improvement next spring. Both water channels have been repaired and are ready for water to be released next spring to replant summer crops. One of them needs to be rerouted, which requires a lot of work. All 100 laborers in the village plan to complete it in five days. Although I don't use this channel to irrigate my land, I still put in the effort to dig. The village cadres are also working hard. When the masses saw this situation, they dug even more vigorously. The original five-day project was completed in three days, saving 300 jin of millet in food expenses alone. The villagers all said: Lao Zhang, we thought you would put on airs after returning from Beijing, but we didn't expect you to be the same as before! Dry land has also been worked on. Before the ground froze, we started repairing the land, planning to fix all the water inlets and field boundaries. We have now converted sloping land into flat land. Zhang Fayuan alone has turned five sloping plots into ten flat plots. Zhang Shuqing's two sloping plots have also become five flat plots, and the whole village has repaired 50 mu. In this way, next year's output will be greatly increased. The field boundaries will be universally raised, and next year we will plant hemp seeds, aiming to double this year's income of 100 *shi* of hemp seeds.

    Chairman Mao: We have turned winter idleness into busy winter work. If someone walks into our mountain village during the day, they are guaranteed not to find a single young man or woman at leisure. Our production and study are just beginning. We will report to you again when we have achieved even greater results.

    Zhang Shuyi, Liangqiangou Village, District Three, Lingshou County, Hebei Province

    荣军生产模范张树义
    写信给毛主席亲爱的毛主席：
    在全国劳模大会上您所嘱咐的话，我都记在心里了。我决以加紧生产、努力学习的成绩回答您的关怀。目前美帝正在朝鲜进行侵略战争，并想进攻我国。我们组里的人们，一致表示要加倍努力生产，计划自明年起，争取全组二十九户做到耕二余一，来支援朝鲜抗美战争。现在我已新学了一百五十个生字，加上过去的基础，简单通知可以看明大意了。我村有三处民校。良前沟民校在我督促下已开学一个月了。在生产上，我的拨工组中二十九户已造出三十圈粪，计四千四百六十担。现已开始向地里运送，以腾出明春时间修地。两道水渠均已修妥，只待明年春暖时，一放水即可补种夏苗。其中一道必须改道，费工很大。全村一百个劳力计划五天完成。我虽不用此渠浇地，但也下力开挖。村干部也都个个卖力干。群众一见这种情况，挖得更起劲了。原计五天工程，三天就完成了，只饭费一项就省了小米三百斤。老乡都说：老张，你从北京回来，我们以为你得拿架子哩，不想你还是这个样子！旱地也早已着手加工。没上冻以前，就开始修地，凡是水口、地碣都打算修复。现已将斜坡地改为平地。只张发元一人，五块坡地就变成了十块平板地。张树庆二块坡地也变成了五块平板地，全村已修五十亩。这样，明年产量将大为提高。地碣将普遍加高，明年点上大麻籽，要使它超过今年地碣收入一百市斗的一倍。
    毛主席：我们已变冬闲为冬忙了。有人白天走进我们的山庄，保证他找不见一个年青少壮的男女在休闲。我们的生产、学习正在开始，等获有更大成绩时，再向您报告。
    河北省灵寿县三区良前沟村  张树义
