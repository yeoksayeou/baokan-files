[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Recently, diphtheria cases have been discovered in Beijing. According to statistics: 36 cases were discovered in October, with 7 deaths; 40 cases were discovered in November, with 9 deaths. Most of the patients are children aged six or seven. In order to prevent the spread of diphtheria, the Municipal Public Health Bureau began administering preventive injections to children under ten years old this spring. As of the end of November, more than 86,000 children in the city have been injected with diphtheria toxoid; however, many children have not yet been vaccinated. Winter and spring are seasons when diphtheria is prone to outbreaks, and citizens should pay attention to prevention. Children under the age of ten who have not been vaccinated should go to public hospitals, health centers, epidemic prevention stations, and specially contracted private hospitals for free injections. If symptoms such as sore throat and fever are discovered, a doctor should be consulted immediately. If diphtheria is indeed diagnosed, the local health center or epidemic prevention station should be notified immediately, and isolation should be carried out.

    【京市新闻处讯】京市近来时有白喉患者发现。据统计：十月份发现三十六人，死七人；十一月份发现四十人，死九人。患者多为六、七岁儿童。市公共卫生局为预防白喉流行，在今年春天即开始对十岁以下儿童进行预防注射，截至十一月底，全市已有八万六千余儿童注射了白喉类毒素；但未接受注射的儿童仍多。冬季与春季是白喉容易流行的季节，市民应注意预防。凡十岁以下未注射预防针的儿童，应往各公立医院、卫生所、防疫站及特约的私立医院免费注射。如发现有喉头疼、发热现象时，应立即请医生检查。经诊断确实为白喉后，则应即时报告住区卫生所或防疫站并进行隔离。
