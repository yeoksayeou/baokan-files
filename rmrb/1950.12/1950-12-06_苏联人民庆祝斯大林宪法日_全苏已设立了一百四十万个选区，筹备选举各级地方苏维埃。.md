Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th (TASS dispatch): People across the Soviet Union are enthusiastically celebrating Stalin Constitution Day on December 5th. The Soviet Constitution is the most democratic constitution in the world. In human history, the Stalin Constitution for the first time established a strong and absolutely reliable Soviet democracy. It established and guaranteed universal, equal, and direct suffrage, enabling the masses to actively participate in state affairs.

This year, the Soviet working people are celebrating Stalin Constitution Day during the high tide of the local Soviet election campaign. Therefore, the superiority of Soviet democracy, which guarantees the active participation of the working people in state management, is particularly prominent. The local Soviets of Working People's Deputies are a form of mass participation of the people in state management. Currently, 1.4 million electoral districts have been established nationwide to prepare for the election of Soviets at all levels, including regions, states, districts, cities, villages, and residential areas. The working people in each electoral district have held candidate nomination meetings. All nationalities of the Soviet Union have exercised the broadest political rights granted to them by the Constitution, nominating their most outstanding sons and daughters as Soviet deputies. The Soviet electoral system allows voters full freedom to propose those they wish to elect, to propose those they trust who can guarantee their interests as candidates, and to vote for these people.

The Soviet people have already nominated the great creator, leader, and teacher of the Constitution, Stalin, as their first candidate. The Moscow City Election Commission has registered 1,452 candidates for the City Soviet. Among them are outstanding politicians, social leaders, advanced workers, scientists, writers, doctors, educators, and artists. Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms – the leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government – will all be candidates in the Moscow City Soviet election. Those already registered and listed as candidates also include: Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; Popova, one of the secretaries of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; Marshal of the Soviet Union Budyonny; lathe operator Isosimov; Soviet People's Artist Savadsky; textile worker Zhutkik; Professor of Otorhinolaryngology Trutnev; and writer Leonov, among others.

The local Soviet election campaign, based on the Stalin Constitution, demonstrates the unity of the Soviet people, and the indestructibility of the Stalinist Party and non-Party alliance. In all respects, it demonstrates the enormous superiority of the Soviet, socialist, and genuinely people's democratic system.

    苏联人民庆祝斯大林宪法日
    全苏已设立了一百四十万个选区，筹备选举各级地方苏维埃。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：苏联各地人民热烈庆祝十二月五日斯大林宪法日。苏联宪法是全世界一部最民主的宪法。在人类历史上，斯大林宪法首次确立了坚强和绝对经得起考验的苏维埃民主。它确立和保证了普遍、平等和直接的参政权，使人民大众积极参与国家的事务。
    今年，苏联劳动人民是在地方苏维埃选举运动的高潮中庆祝斯大林宪法日的。因此，保证劳动人民积极参与国家管理的苏维埃民主的优越性，就显得特别突出。各地方劳动人民代表苏维埃是人民大规模参加国家管理的一种形式。目前，全国已经设立了一百四十万个选区，以准备选出边疆区、州、区、城镇、乡村和居民区等各级苏维埃，每一个选区的劳动人民都曾经举行了候选人的提名大会。苏联各族人民都运用了宪法给予他们的最广泛的政治权利，推选他们最优秀的儿女为苏维埃代表。苏联选举制度使选民有充分的自由来提出他们所希望选举的人，提出他们所信任的那些能保证他们利益的人来当候选人，并投票选举这些人。
    苏联人民已经提出伟大的宪法创造者、领袖和导师斯大林为他们的第一名候选人，莫斯科市选举委员会已经登记了一千四百五十二名市苏维埃的候选人。其中有卓越的政治家、社会领袖、先进工人、科学家、作家、医生、教育家、艺术工作者。斯大林的最亲密的战友——布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府的领袖们——都将是莫斯科市苏维埃选举的候选人。已经登记和列入候选人名单的尚有：苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫、全苏工会中央理事会书记之一波波娃、苏联元帅布琼尼、旋工伊索西莫夫、苏联人民艺术家萨瓦德斯基、纺织工人朱特基克，耳喉科医学教授特鲁特涅夫、作家里昂诺夫等。
    以斯大林宪法为基础的地方苏维埃选举运动证明了苏联人民的团结，证明了斯大林党和非党联盟的不可摧毁性，它在一切方面显示了苏维埃、社会主义、真正人民民主制度的巨大优越性。
