    Hunan, Shaanxi, and Ningxia Conduct Land Reform in Various Counties
    Establish People's Courts to Punish Unlawful Landlords
    [Report from this newspaper] To effectively punish lurking bandits, special agents, and unlawful landlords, counties in Hunan Province have successively established People's Courts. Currently, 35 county-level People's Courts and more than 60 branch courts have been established throughout the province. The People's Courts in various counties have accepted many peasant accusations and have legally sanctioned reactionary bandits, special agents, and unlawful landlords. Jiang Guoliang, a landlord in Lishan Township, Ningxiang County, illegally sold land, burned houses, cut down forests, colluded with bandits and special agents, and privately hid guns, plotting a riot. After being reported by the peasants of the township, the county People's Court investigated and verified the facts and has dealt with him severely according to the law. With the support of the People's Courts, the struggle against sabotage by peasants in various places is rising day by day, and they are spontaneously organizing to monitor unlawful landlords. Zhou Dingxun, a landlord in Fanjiang Township, Xiangxiang County, attempted to damage the forest but was discovered and stopped by the peasants. Fan Guizhen, a landlord in Laohu Township, Changsha County, secretly hid grain late at night and was captured by the militia.
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Court of Guangde County, southern Anhui, sentenced Li Chengyu, an unlawful landlord in Nanlai Village of the county, to three years of imprisonment. Before liberation, the criminal was a puppet Bao chief and cruelly suppressed the peasants. He drafted as many as eleven able-bodied men at one time. After liberation, he infiltrated the village government and carried out destructive activities on a large scale. During the land reform, he concealed land, monitored the actions of working personnel, and eavesdropped on the contents of meetings, etc. (Wang Rongfeng)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] The land reform movement in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province and Yanchi and Ningshuo counties of Ningxia Province has been launched in the vast rural areas. To ensure the smooth progress of land reform, all counties have established People's Courts to legally punish the crimes of a few unlawful landlords who spread rumors and sabotaged land reform before and in the early stages of land reform.
    In September and October this year, when Guanzhong counties and Ningshuo and other places were re-trying land reform at the township level, destructive activities by unlawful landlords were discovered. For example, Tian Guiqin, a landlord in Baishui County, Shaanxi, illegally stole and sold more than 100 mu of cultivated land. Wang Wenxuan, a landlord in Hu County, cut down all seven mu of bamboo forest. The director of a farmers' association in a village in Chang'an County was even beaten and injured by thugs bought by an unlawful landlord. Cao Ruitian, a landlord in Ningshuo County, not only stole and sold land but also demolished houses. These crimes aroused the anger of the vast number of peasants, who demanded that the government punish them. Many cases of sabotage by unlawful landlords have recently been handled and judged by the People's Courts in Chang'an, Jingyang, Liquan, and other six counties, including 24 major cases. During the interrogation, the People's Courts, with the assistance of the peasants, seized many guns hidden by unlawful landlords. Cao Ruitian, an unlawful landlord in Ningshuo, is also being arrested and interrogated by the county People's Court.
    With the righteous support of the People's Courts, the land reform movement in Guanzhong is progressing smoothly. To defend the fruits of their liberation and prevent unlawful landlords and bandits from causing trouble, the peasants are now generally expanding militia organizations and strengthening sentry posts and patrols.

    湖南陕西宁夏进行土改各县
    建立人民法庭制裁不法地主
    【本报讯】为有效地制裁潜伏匪特及不法地主，湖南各县纷纷建立人民法庭。现全省已有三十五个县成立了县人民法庭及六十多个分庭。各县人民法庭受理了多起农民控告，依法制裁了反动匪特与不法地主。宁乡县栗山乡地主姜国梁违法偷卖土地，烧毁房屋，砍伐森林，并勾结匪特，私藏枪枝，阴谋暴动。经该乡农民告发，该县人民法庭侦讯属实后，已予依法严办。在人民法庭的支持下，各地农民反破坏斗争日益高涨，纷纷自动组织起来监视不法地主。湘乡县翻江乡地主周鼎勋企图破坏森林，被农民发觉，得以制止。长沙县捞湖乡地主范贵真深夜偷藏粮食，被民兵捕获。
    【本报讯】皖南广德县人民法庭判处该县南来村不法地主李承裕有期徒刑三年。该犯于解放前为伪保长，曾残酷镇压农民。只抓壮丁一次，即达十一人之多。解放后钻入村政权，大肆破坏活动。在土地改革进行中，并隐瞒土地，监视工作人员行动，偷听会议内容等。（汪荣丰）
    【新华社西安十三日电】陕西省关中各县和宁夏省盐池、宁朔两县的土地改革运动已在广大农村中展开。为保证土地改革顺利进行，各县都已成立了人民法庭，依法制裁了土地改革前和土地改革初期，少数不法地主对土地改革的造谣破坏的罪行。
    今年九、十月间，关中各县和宁朔等地在重新乡试办土地改革时，都曾发现不法地主的破坏活动。如陕西白水县地主田贵勤违法盗卖耕地一百多亩。鄠县地主王文轩将七亩竹林全部砍光。长安县某村农民协会主任竟被不法地主收买暴徒打伤。宁朔县地主曹瑞田等不仅盗卖土地，并拆毁房屋。这些罪行激起了广大农民的愤怒，要求政府予以制裁。长安、泾阳、醴泉等六县最近经人民法庭处理判决的不法地主破坏案很多，其中重大案件有二十四起。审讯中，人民法庭在农民协助下，查获不法地主隐藏的枪枝很多。宁朔不法地主曹瑞田，也正被该县人民法庭捕押审讯中。
    在人民法庭正义支持下，关中各地土地改革运动正在顺利进展。农民们为保卫翻身果实，严防不法地主和匪特捣乱，现在普遍扩大民兵组织，加强了岗哨和巡逻。
