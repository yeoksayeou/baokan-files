Xinhua News Agency, December 7th:

    The China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression today issued a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue and denouncing the American imperialism's crimes of occupying China's territory Taiwan and using Japan as a war base for aggression against China and other Asian countries. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    We fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue and call on the people of the whole country to resolutely oppose the aggressive conspiracy of the American government and jointly strive to defend the security of the motherland and world peace.
    The memorandum on the Japanese peace treaty issue that the US government submitted to the Soviet government on October 26 exposed the US government's attempt to undermine the basic principles of the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the June 19, 1947, Far Eastern Commission regarding the Japanese peace treaty; to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and absorb the Japanese reactionary government into the United Nations; to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands; the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, which should be returned and handed over to the Soviet Union, as well as the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, which originally belonged to Japan; to arm Japan's army, navy, and air force and restore Japan's war industry; and to occupy Japan for a long time and use Japan as a base for aggressive war. Subsequently, MacArthur, the head of the US occupation forces in Japan, announced on November 8 the "parole" of Shigemitsu Mamoru, a Class A war criminal and the culprit of aggression against China. Since May of this year, MacArthur has illegally released a total of 148 Japanese war criminals. American troops are also using Japanese soldiers to carry out the war of aggression against Korea. All of this proves that the US government is determined to support the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces and make Japan its accomplice in aggression against China, Korea, and other Asian countries; proving that American imperialism and Japanese imperialism, despite having a short period of uneven distribution of spoils, are equally vicious to the Chinese people and are our irreconcilable mortal enemies.
    After eight years of heroic resistance, the Chinese people shed countless blood, suffered heavy sacrifices, defeated Japanese imperialism, and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Our patriotic compatriots throughout the country will never allow the revival of Japanese aggression forces, will never allow American imperialism to seize the fruits of China's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and will never allow all the perverse actions of the American government and Japanese reactionary forces. The imperialists' attempt to obliterate the legitimate rights and interests of the 500 million great Chinese people is destined to fail. Foreign Minister Zhou's statement represents the will of our people: the preparation and drafting of the Japanese peace treaty without the participation of the People's Republic of China, regardless of its steps, content, and outcome, are all illegal and invalid.

    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    拥护周恩来外长声明
    反对美帝国主义对日单独媾和
    【新华社七日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会本日发表声明，拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长关于对日和约问题的声明，并痛斥美帝国主义侵占中国领土台湾，和利用日本作为侵略中国和亚洲各国的战争基地的罪行。声明原文如下：
    我们完全拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长关于对日和约问题的声明，并号召全国人民坚决反对美国政府的侵略阴谋，共同奋起为保卫祖国安全和世界和平而奋斗。
    美国政府十月二十六日递交给苏联政府一个关于对日和约问题的备忘录，暴露美国政府企图破坏开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会所规定的对日和约的基本原则，与日本单独媾和，吸收日本反动政府参加联合国；侵占中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛，应该交还和交予苏联的库页岛南部和千岛群岛，以及原属日本的琉球群岛和小笠原群岛；武装日本的陆海空军，恢复日本的战争工业；并长期占领日本，利用日本作为侵略战争基地。接着，美国驻日占领军首脑麦克阿瑟于十一月八日宣布“假释”日本甲级战犯、侵略中国的罪魁重光葵出狱。自本年五月以来，麦克阿瑟已非法释放了日本战犯共一百四十八名。美国军队并利用日本军人进行侵略朝鲜的战争。所有这些，证明美国政府决心扶植日本侵略势力再起，使日本成为其侵略中国、朝鲜和亚洲各国的帮凶；证明美国帝国主义和日本帝国主义尽管有过一个短时期的分赃不均，但是对于中国人民却是同样地狠毒，同样是我们不共戴天的死敌。
    中国人民经过八年英勇抗战，流了无数鲜血，遭受重大牺牲，打败日本帝国主义，取得抗日战争的胜利。我全国爱国同胞，决不能容许日本侵略势力复活，决不能容许美国帝国主义侵占中国抗战胜利的果实，决不能容许美国政府和日本反动势力的一切倒行逆施。帝国主义者企图抹煞五万万伟大的中国人民的正当权益，是注定着要失败的。周外长的声明代表了我全国人民的意志：对日和约的准备和拟制如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其步骤、内容和结果如何，一概是非法的，无效的。
