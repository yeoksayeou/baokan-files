Reader Q&A

    Editorial Comrade:
    Is transportation considered a commercial activity? Can government agencies and military units engage in transportation businesses? Please reply.
    Yang Xiuqing

    Comrade Yang Xiuqing: Your question is answered as follows:
    "Transportation" refers to operating passenger and freight transport services using transportation vehicles. Its nature belongs to the transportation industry and is not considered a commercial activity.
    The government permits various government agencies and military units to organize transportation with their manpower and animal power. However, the following must be ensured: (1) When various government agencies and military units engage in transportation businesses, they must not use public vehicles, ships, or other means of transportation. Moreover, they must operate in an enterprise-like manner, meaning that all expenses incurred in the operation of transportation must be paid from the transportation profits and not supplied from the funds of the respective government agencies or military units. It is not permissible if the various expenses in transportation are paid by the public, while the transportation profits are used by the respective units for their own use. (2) They are only limited to undertaking transportation business (they should mainly undertake transportation tasks for various government agencies, military units, and state-owned trading companies) and must not use their funds to engage in the buying and selling of goods. If they use their funds to engage in the buying and selling of goods, it belongs to a commercial nature, which generally speaking, is not permitted by government laws and regulations. (3) In order to help farmers sell local products, they may operate the buying and selling of certain kinds of local products after the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee.

    机关部队可否进行运输业务？编辑同志：
    运输是否算商业行为？机关部队可否进行运输业务？请答复。
    杨秀卿杨秀卿同志：你的问题，答复如下：
    “运输”是指以交通运输工具，经营客货运输业务，其性质是属于交通运输事业，不算商业行为。
    各机关部队以其人力、畜力组织运输，政府是允许的。但必须做到：（一）各机关部队经营运输事业时，不得利用公家的汽车、轮船等交通工具，且必须做到经营企业化，即凡在经营运输中的一切开支，皆应由其运输利润中支出，不得由各机关、部队的经费中供给。如运输中的各种开支由公家支出，而运输利润则由各该单位自用，则是不允许的。（二）只限于承揽运输业务（应以承揽各机关、部队及国营贸易公司的运输任务为主），不得以其资金从事货物贩运业务。如以其资金从事货物贩运，即属于商业性质，一般来讲，是政府法令所不允许的。（三）为着帮助农民推销土产，得经财委决定经营某几种土产的贩运。
