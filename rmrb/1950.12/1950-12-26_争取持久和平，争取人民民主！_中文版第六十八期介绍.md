    Introducing "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 68
    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 68 has been published. This issue is a special edition dedicated to the Second World Peace Congress, featuring an editorial entitled "A Fighting Program for the World Peace Struggle," and containing the documents of the Second World Peace Congress and a log of the congress's proceedings. The editorial points out: The characteristic of the Second World Peace Congress is that it demonstrated the unprecedented mass character and outstanding organization of the peace movement. More than two thousand delegates from eighty countries across five continents gathered in Warsaw, making the congress a truly global gathering of peace fighters. This congress truly expressed the peace-loving will of all progressive humanity and issued a fighting call to the people of the world: "We must not wait for peace, we must strive for peace." Therefore, the resolutions passed by the Second World Peace Congress are a powerful weapon in the hands of active peace fighters, and a fighting program to mobilize the broad masses to thwart the sinister plans of the warmongers. The instigators of war are relatively weak and fewer in number than peace fighters. There is no doubt that the bloody hands of the arsonists of a new war will certainly be stopped.
    In addition, this issue publishes a commentary on the American jet fighter attack on the Soviet airliner carrying French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez from Paris to Moscow for medical treatment, entitled "Another Provocation by American Air Pirates," and essays such as "The Electrification Plan of the Romanian People's Republic" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and "The Franco Faction and the Tito Faction - Birds of a Feather" by Grigore, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Spain.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”  中文版第六十八期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第六十八期已出版。本期是第二届世界保卫和平大会特刊，发表了题为“世界和平斗争的战斗纲领”的社论，并登载了第二届世界保卫和平大会的文件和大会进行的日志。社论指出：第二届世界保卫和平大会的特点是表现了保卫和平运动的空前的群众性和卓越的组织性。来自五大洲八十个国家的二千以上的代表聚集在华沙，使大会成了真正的世界性的和平战士的集会。这次大会真正表达了全体进步人类爱好和平的意志，并向全世界人民发出战斗的号召：“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平。”所以第二届保卫世界和平大会所通过的决议是积极的和平战士们手中的一柄有力的武器，是一个动员广大群众挫败战争贩子们的罪恶计划的战斗纲领。战争的煽动者们是比较弱的，在数量上比和平战士少。毫无疑问，新战争的纵火者的血腥的双手一定会被制止的。
    另外，这一期登载了评论美国喷气战斗机袭击搭载法国共产党总书记多列士由巴黎前往莫斯科就医的苏联客机的“美国空中强盗最近的一次挑衅”一文和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌——德治所作“罗马尼亚人民共和国电气化计划”、西班牙共产党政治局委员格利哥所作“佛朗哥分子和铁托分子——一丘之貉”等论文。
