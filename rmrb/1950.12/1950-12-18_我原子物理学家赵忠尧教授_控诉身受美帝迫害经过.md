Xinhua News Agency, 15th: A delayed dispatch from Shanghai: Our atomic physicist Professor Zhao Zhongyao and nine Chinese students who had been studying in the United States, Britain, and Canada, who were detained in Tokyo by American imperialism for two months while returning to China, arrived in Shanghai on the 4th and were warmly welcomed by the people of Shanghai. In his talks and speeches over the past few days, Professor Zhao recounted his experience of being persecuted and denounced American imperialism as the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people.

Professor Zhao Zhongyao stated that he went to the United States in the spring of 1946 to observe the Bikini atomic bomb test and study nuclear physics. Because he saw that the establishment of the People's Republic of China had put the motherland on a bright path, he had been preparing to return to China as early as March of this year. After five months of obstruction, he finally obtained a transit permit from the British government in Hong Kong.

On August 29th, he boarded the President Wilson ship with the third group of students returning to China from the United States from Los Angeles. Plainclothes agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation chased after them like hounds. They arbitrarily checked his luggage on the dock, and all books and magazines related to physics were unreasonably confiscated.

On the morning of September 12th, the ship docked in Yokohama, Japan. Plainclothes detectives from the Yokohama Intelligence Department of the U.S. Occupation Headquarters in Japan boarded the ship again to call the names and inspect the luggage of Professor Zhao Zhongyao and other returning students, and once again took away their books, lecture notes, notes, and chemical reagents. Afterwards, they even used the excuse of asking them to "cooperate" in checking their luggage and took them to the U.S. Yokohama Intelligence Department and placed them under house arrest. U.S. intelligence agencies also falsely claimed that the luggage had been sent to Tokyo for inspection and that the ship might be delayed for four hours. But at midnight, they were put on a prison van and sent directly to the damp, musty basement cell of the U.S. military prison in Nakano, Tokyo.

The next morning, U.S. agents violently handcuffed them and escorted them to Sugamo Prison, where they were confined in solitary confinement in cells prepared for the No. 13 gallows, and later transferred to cells holding Chinese "prisoners." There, they were placed two people in a small room, and all their clothes and belongings were stripped away, and they were forced to wear single prison uniforms printed with six "P"s. After repeated protests, a U.S. intelligence agent from Tokyo finally came to tell them: "We are executing Washington's decision."

Tokyo's Sugamo Prison was originally used to detain Japanese war criminals, but in the prison, Japanese war criminals were more free than Chinese "prisoners" and could go out for walks every day. The sentenced Chinese "prisoners" had to do hard labor for half a day or all day on empty stomachs, forced to manufacture ammunition boxes for the United States. Many Chinese "prisoners" were often sent to Taiwan in batches, with their fate unknown. But Japanese war criminals were being released one by one.

Professor Zhao Zhongyao said that they were detained without any reason in this inhuman Japanese prison, day after day. After more than a month, the American imperialists could not find any excuse to detain them. It was not until the evening of October 28th that they were notified that they could be released. They were taken to a Colonel Leiser of the U.S. Occupation Headquarters in Japan. Colonel Leiser said, "Some of the things you brought violate export laws." So even a few gramophone records were confiscated before they were sent to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's delegation in Japan. After they arrived there, they were closely guarded by plainclothes military police of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. When they refused to go to Taiwan, they moved to the Gajoen Hotel on November 15th. During their stay in Japan, tens of thousands of students in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places were on strike and demonstrating against American imperialism's control of Japan.

Professor Zhao said joyfully: When we saw an excerpt from an overseas Chinese Min Pao newspaper reprinting the full text of the National Science Association's protest against our unreasonable persecution, we felt even more longing for our motherland. After many hardships, we finally left Yokohama on November 20th and returned to the embrace of our motherland.

Professor Zhao expressed great indignation at the atrocities of American imperialism. He said: Now that I have returned to the motherland, I must fulfill my responsibility as a member of the people and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. With the strength of China and the peace-loving people of the world, American imperialism, which dares to launch aggression, is bound to fail.

    我原子物理学家赵忠尧教授  
    控诉身受美帝迫害经过
    在日本巢鸭监狱里，中国“犯人”挨饿做苦工，日本战犯却一个个被释放出去！
    【新华社十五日讯】上海迟到消息：由美返国途中被美国帝国主义扣押在东京达两个月之久的我国原子物理学家赵忠尧教授和我国原在美、英、加等国留学的学生九人，于四日由穗抵沪，受到上海人民热烈欢迎。赵教授在连日的谈话和演讲中，控诉他身受迫害的经过，痛斥美国帝国主义是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。
    赵忠尧教授称，他在一九四六年春天曾前往美国参观比基尼原子弹爆炸试验，并研究原子核物理学。因为他看到中华人民共和国的成立，使祖国走上了光明的道路，所以他早在今年三月即准备返国。经过五个月留难，才获得香港英政府的过境许可证。
    八月二十九日，他随同第三批留美回国学生由洛杉矶登上威尔逊总统号轮船。美国联邦调查局的便衣特务像猎狗一样追来。他们把他的行李搁在码头上肆意检查，凡是有关物理学的书籍、杂志都被无理扣留。
    九月十二日晨，船经日本横滨靠岸，美国驻日占领军总部横滨情报部的便衣暗探，又上船点名要检查赵忠尧教授及同行留美返国学生的行李，并再一次带走了他们的书刊、讲义、笔记和化学药品。事后竟又借口请他们“合作”检查行李，把他们带到美国横滨情报部软禁起来。美国特务机关还谎骗地说，行李已送到东京去检查，船可能延迟四小时离港。但到了午夜却把他们押上囚车，直送到东京中野美军监狱的潮湿霉臭的底层牢房里。
    第二天上午，美国特务便横暴地把他们用手铐铐起来，解到巢鸭监狱，单人隔离地禁闭在预备送往十三号绞刑室的囚室里，以后又转到关闭中国“犯人”的囚房里。那里是两人一间斗室，所有衣服用品都被剥光拿走，穿上印着六个“Ｐ”字的单囚服。经过他们历次提出抗议，很久之后才有一个美国驻东京情报部的特务来告诉他们说：“我们执行的是华盛顿的决定。”
    东京巢鸭监狱本来是拘禁日本战犯的，但在监狱里日本战犯却比中国“犯人”自由，每天可以出来散步。而判了刑的中国“犯人”饿着肚子还要半天或整天做苦工，被迫为美国制造子弹盒。很多中国“犯人”常被一批批押送台湾，死活不明。但是日本战犯却一个个被释放出去。
    赵忠尧教授说，他们就被毫无理由地拘押在这种非人生活的日本监牢里，一天拖一天。过了一个多月，美国帝国主义者实在找不出任何借口拘留他们，直到十月二十八日晚上，才通知他们可以出狱，把他们带到美国驻日占领军一个莱赛上校那儿，莱赛上校说：“你们带的东西中，有一部分违背出口法。”于是连几张留声机唱片也没收了，才把他们送到蒋匪帮驻日代表团去。他们到那里以后，就被蒋匪帮的便衣宪兵牢牢看守。当他们拒绝了去台湾时，才在十一月十五日搬到雅叙园旅舍里去住。在日本期间，东京、大阪等地，成千成万的大学生正在罢课、游行，反对美国帝国主义管制日本。
    赵教授欢欣地说：当我们从一份油印的华侨民报上看到一段转载全国科协抗议我们被无理迫害的全文，心中更感到对祖国的怀念。经过千辛万苦，我们最后才于十一月二十日离开横滨，回到祖国的怀抱里来。
    赵教授对美国帝国主义的暴行，表示了极大的愤慨，他说：我这次回到祖国来，一定要尽人民一分子的责任，积极参加抗美援朝工作。以中国和全世界爱好和平人民力量的强大，美国帝国主义敢于发动侵略，必定失败。
