On a clear day, a silver-grey iron eagle soared valiantly into the deep skies of the motherland. Just as people were trying to discern its flight path, it suddenly dove down, performing breathtaking aerobatics such as "loop-the-loops," rolls, and climbing turns. Each of its aerobatic displays ignited cheers from the crowd on the airfield. Even the instructors, with their wealth of flying experience, nodded in admiration. They were heartily delighted to see the pilot they had painstakingly trained master the skills. The pilot of this iron eagle was Zhang Shouen, a young aviation trainee of New China. He demonstrated astonishing skill from the very beginning of his solo flights. This skill was not easily obtained, but was the result of his diligent study.

The young aviation trainee Zhang Shouen, like other air force fighters, possesses excellent qualities of courage, composure, carefulness, and decisiveness, and also has vigorous vitality. His strong and robust physique, and his red face, make people feel that he is a typical example of our country's youth.

Zhang Shouen was born in a poor peasant family in Shandong Province and is a member of the Communist Party of China. For a long time, he had a strong desire to learn to fly in the air force. After entering aviation school, due to his high blood pressure, although he requested to participate in the training several times, he was not approved, but only allowed to do general work. When he saw other young people flying in the skies of the motherland in batches, he couldn't help himself and requested to participate in the training again. After checking that his body had improved and was suitable for flying, the leaders approved his request. He was extremely happy.

When he officially joined the training, many courses were already more than halfway through, which was a big hurdle for him. Moreover, he only had the equivalent of a higher primary school education. However, Zhang Shouen was not intimidated by the difficulties. He only thought, "Study hard and catch up!" Because he knew that the guardians of the motherland's airspace must be brave warriors who are good at overcoming difficulties.

Intense study began. The first problem Zhang Shouen encountered was that he couldn't understand anything in class. On the one hand, he attended classes on time; on the other hand, he made up for past lessons in his spare time. He borrowed other people's notes and copied down the main courses in detail, such as the principles of flight, navigation, and the theory of engines. He sacrificed Sundays, lunch breaks, and even after the lights were turned off at night, he secretly used the corridor lights to read other people's notes and review the day's lessons. Sometimes, when he was too sleepy to hold on, but couldn't think of a better way to stimulate his brain because he didn't smoke, he had to wash his head with cold water to temporarily clear his head and continue to persevere in his hard work. He sought a thorough understanding of every question, and when he encountered difficulties, he always pondered them over and over again until he found a solution. For example, when learning about various instruments, the instructors required each aviation trainee to be able to identify the positions of various instruments with their eyes closed and be able to use them proficiently, just like a person familiar with every part of their own body. However, there were so many instruments on the plane, and his study time was so short, which was indeed a great difficulty. Whenever he had time, he practiced with his eyes closed, memorizing the shapes of various instruments and silently measuring the location of each instrument. In this way, he was finally able to start the plane skillfully with his eyes closed.

During the training period, his thoughts were highly concentrated. When he first started learning to fly, he was unable to land the plane with all three points simultaneously (the plane must land with all three wheels at the same time when landing). To this end, he not only repeatedly asked the instructors and studied with his classmates, but even pondered this problem while eating. When he understood the principle of landing the plane with all three points simultaneously, he studied and practiced hard according to these principles. Once, twice... By the second flight practice, he was able to land with all three points perfectly.

This tenacious perseverance and high patriotic enthusiasm were cultivated in a long period of hardship. When he was ten years old, the Japanese invaders occupied his hometown, and the robbers tied up his elderly grandfather and father. When he saw his fellow villagers carrying back his grandfather, who was covered in scars from being beaten by the enemy, and his father, who was only left with a breath after being beaten by the enemy, flames of hatred for the enemy burned in his young heart. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, like other farmers, his family's life became prosperous, which made him deeply grateful to the Communist Party for bringing him happy times. He felt that the motherland was infinitely warm and infinitely lovely, and he automatically joined the ranks of the great patriotic self-defense war.

When he saw in the newspaper that American imperialism was frantically slaughtering the Korean people and cruelly destroying their happy lives, he thought of those Korean people who had fought alongside the Chinese people in the past, our sincere friends, who are now being slaughtered by American imperialism, which aroused his infinite resentment towards American imperialism. Especially when he saw the American imperialists bombing our compatriots time and time again, he angrily calculated the number of times the American imperialist planes had taken off, and he more clearly calculated the number of Chinese people killed and injured and the amount of property destroyed. All of this further increased his hatred for the enemy. He silently thought: This is such a brutal and shameless means! This is a new blood debt! Every time he thought of this, he concentrated all his thoughts on how to master new science and technology faster and more skillfully, and shoot down all the American imperialist planes that invaded us.

His flying skills, like his hatred for the enemy, are improving by leaps and bounds. He will soon be able to pilot his own iron eagle and bravely defend the motherland's airspace.

    青年飞行学员张守恩
    朱波
    一个晴朗的日子，一架银灰色的铁鹰，矫健地腾向深远的祖国的高空，当人们正在探视它的飞行方位的时候，它急骤地俯冲下来了，接着，表演那使人心惊的特技——“翻筋斗”、横滚、上升转弯。它的每一种特技表演，都在机场上人群中激起一片欢呼声，连那有着丰富飞行经验的教员，也连连点头赞叹。他们看到自己苦心培育的飞行员，已经掌握了技术，感到衷心的喜悦。这只铁鹰的驾驶者就是新中国的青年飞行学员张守恩。他在开始单独飞行的时候，就表现了使人惊异的技能。这种技能不是容易得来的，这是他埋头苦学的结果。
    年青的飞行学员张守恩，和其他空军战士一样，具备着勇敢、沉着、细心、果断的优良品质，并且有着蓬勃的朝气，他那健壮而又魁伟的体格，红红的面孔，使人感到他正是我们祖国青年的典型。
    张守恩出生在山东省一个贫苦农民的家里，中国共产党党员。很久以来，他就有一个学习空军的要求，进入航校后，因为血压较高，虽曾数次要求参加学习，都没有被批准，只让他作一般的工作。当他看到其他青年，一批批飞行在祖国的天空时，他忍不住了，再次请求参加学习。检查了他的身体已有了进步，适合飞行条件了，领导同志就批准了他的请求。他真是愉快极了。
    当他正式参加学习的时候，很多课程已经进行了一多半，这对他不能不是一个很大的难关，况且他只有一个相当于高小的程度；但是，张守恩没有被困难吓倒，他只想到：“加油学，赶上去！”因为他知道祖国领空的守卫者，必须是勇敢而且善于征服困难的战士。
    紧张的学习开始了，张守恩碰到的第一个问题，就是：在课堂上什么也听不懂。他一方面按时上课，一方面在课余的时间，补习过去的功课。他借阅别人的笔记，把主要的课程，如飞行原理、领航学以及有关发动机的理论等，都详细地抄下来。他牺牲了星期日，牺牲了午睡时间，甚至在夜晚熄灯以后，还偷偷地利用走廊的灯光阅读别人的笔记，温习当天的功课。有时，困得实在不能支持了，却又因为不会吸烟，想不出更好的刺激脑子的办法，只好用冷水洗头，使头脑能暂时清醒一下，继续坚持苦学。他对每一个问题，都寻求着透彻的理解，遇到疑难，总是翻来覆去地思索着，直到获得解决为止。比方，当学习各种仪表的时候，教员要求每个飞行学员闭着眼睛能够判明各种仪表的位置，并能够熟练地使用它，如同一个人熟习自己身体的每个部分一样。可是，飞机上有着这么多的仪表，而他学习的时间又是这么短，这的确是一个很大的困难。一有时间，他就闭着眼睛练习，死记各种仪表的形状，默测每一个仪表所在的位置。这样，他终于能够闭着眼睛熟练地开动飞机了。
    在学习期间，他的思想是非常集中的。在开始学习飞行的时候，他并不能够使飞机三点同时着陆（飞机在着陆时，一定要三个轮子一齐着陆）。为此，他不仅一再请求教员，反复和同学们研究，甚至在吃饭的时候，也思索着这个问题。当他懂得了使飞机三点同时着陆的道理时，他就按照这些道理苦学苦练。一遍、两遍……等到第二次练习飞行的时候，就完全作到三点着陆了。
    这种坚韧的毅力，高度的爱国的热忱，是在长期的苦难生活中培养出来的。他在十岁那年，日寇侵占了他的家乡，强盗们捆走了年老的祖父和父亲。当他看到乡亲抬回被敌人打得遍身鳞伤的祖父，看到被敌人毒打得只剩一口气的父亲，在他幼小的心灵里，燃烧起仇恨敌人的火焰。抗战胜利后，和其他农民一样，他家的生活富裕起来了，这使他深深感激共产党给自己带来的幸福时光，他感到祖国无限温暖，无限可爱，自动参加了伟大的爱国自卫战争的行列。
    当他从报纸上，看到美国帝国主义疯狂似地屠杀朝鲜人民，并对朝鲜人民幸福生活进行残酷的毁灭的时候，他就想到过去那些同中国人民一起战斗的朝鲜人民，我们那些真挚的朋友，现在都遭受美国帝国主义的大肆杀戮，激起了他对美帝的无限的愤恨。特别是当他看到美帝一次一次轰炸我国同胞的时候，他愤恨地计算着美帝飞机出动的次数，他更清楚地计算着被炸死炸伤中国人民及财产毁灭的数目，这些都更增强了他对敌人的仇恨，他默默地想：这是多么残暴而又无耻的手段啊！这是新的血债！他每次想到这里的时候，就把全部思想集中到如何更快地更熟练地掌握住新的科学技术，把侵略我们的美帝飞机全部击落下来。
    他的飞行技术和他对敌人的仇恨一样的，飞跃地向上提高着。他很快地就会驾驶自己的铁鹰，英勇地来保卫祖国的领空。
