    Volunteer Soldier Returning from the Korean Front Talks About the Brutality and Embarrassing Plight of the US Military
    [This newspaper reports] Comrade Mo Baozhen, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who has just returned from the Korean front, told everyone at a joint symposium held by all sectors of youth in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, to celebrate the Korean victory, that he personally witnessed the tragic situation of the Korean people being ravaged by the American imperialists and the current embarrassing plight of the American soldiers under the blows of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. He said: Walking in Korea, it is common to not see a single complete village or house for hundreds of miles, especially near the front lines. Once, an old Korean lady saw comrades from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army passing by and ran over to cry in their arms. It turned out that her entire family—son, daughter-in-law, and daughter—had been killed by the American devils, the cattle had been taken away, and the houses had been bombed. The American devils are so fierce to the peaceful people, but they are so timid and incompetent when they see the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Comrade Mo Baozhen said that he was a reconnaissance soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Once, he and two other comrades went behind enemy lines to capture prisoners. They snuck into a house occupied by five American soldiers, and only one person went in and shouted, and all five American soldiers came out with their heads in their hands to surrender. After escorting them for a mile, the enemy camp discovered that people were missing and fired a burst of guns aimlessly in all directions, and also fired artillery, but the enemy gained nothing. The enemy's supplies have also been deteriorating. In the past, cans and biscuit boxes were left everywhere on the battlefield, but now there are only traces of beef bones, millet, and corn on the battlefield. Most of the captured prisoners had not put on cotton clothes yet. When the prisoners heard that they would not be killed or humiliated, they were overjoyed and pointed to the United States with broken Chinese, repeatedly saying, "Difficult! Difficult!"

    从朝鲜前线回来的志愿军谈
    美军的残暴和狼狈相
    【本报讯】刚从朝鲜前线回来的中国人民志愿军战士么葆桢同志，在松江省双城县各界青年为庆祝朝鲜胜利而举行的联欢座谈会上告诉大家，他亲眼看到朝鲜人民被美帝摧残后的惨象和目前美国兵在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打击下的狼狈相。他说：行走在朝鲜境内，常常好几百里地没见一座完整的村庄和房屋，特别是接近火线的地方。有一次，有一位朝鲜老太太看到中国人民志愿部队的同志走过，就跑过来抱头大哭。原来她一家人——儿子、媳妇、女儿全给美国鬼子杀害了，牛被拉去了，房屋也被炸毁了。美国鬼子对和平人民是那样凶狠，但见到中国人民志愿军却是那样怯懦无能。么葆桢同志说，他在中国人民志愿军部队里担任侦察员任务，一次和另外二个同志去敌后抓俘虏，摸到一个有五个美国兵住着的屋子，只进去了一个人喊了一声，五个美国兵全都抱着头出来投降了。押着他们走了一里地，敌人阵营里发觉少了人，无目的地向四面八方乱放了一阵枪，还开了炮，但敌人一无所获。敌人的给养也已每况愈下，以前战场上到处遗留罐头饼干箱子，现在的战场上只有牛骨头和小米、苞米的痕迹了。捉住的俘虏大都还没穿上棉衣。俘虏们听说不杀他也不受污辱时，欢喜非常，用着生硬的中国话指着美国，连说：“困难！困难！”
