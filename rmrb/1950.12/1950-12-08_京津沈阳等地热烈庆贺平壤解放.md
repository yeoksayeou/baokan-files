    【Report from our newspaper】Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang and Other Places Warmly Celebrate the Liberation of Pyongyang
    [Report from our newspaper] Workers, students, and garrison troops in the capital were ecstatic upon hearing the good news of the liberation of Pyongyang, warmly celebrating the victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the war against American aggression.
    The news of the liberation of Pyongyang immersed the capital's workers in prolonged revelry. Workers jumped, shouted, and spread the news, applauding and cheering. Newspapers were snatched up by everyone. Many units even mobilized street parades for publicity. After hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, railway workers at Xizhimen Station immediately formed a propaganda team, shouting slogans, with some even singing ballads celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang, to promote the news to travelers and citizens. Workers at the locomotive depot immediately held a forum. The materials group decided to make some larger comfort bags for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. After the good news reached the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, workshops immediately erupted. The labor union immediately put up cartoons and big-character posters. Worker Li Yanzhi from the power department slammed the table and shouted, "Well done, well done!" He said: Today I will eat two more bowls of rice, and I will work even harder. The workers in the iron smelting department were so happy that they jumped up and down, saying: We have been looking forward to this news for a long time. The workers in the repair department, while reading the newspaper, praised: Our Volunteer Army is really capable, really capable! Workers at the trolleybus company specially decorated a float, but the drivers were in a dilemma: From early in the morning, student, worker, and office worker parade teams flooded the streets, and there were more and more of them, making it difficult for the trolleybuses to move. Conductor Liang Yugang ran down to buy a newspaper and loudly read it to the passengers. Inside the 70th Arsenal, posters with slogans such as "Celebrating the Liberation of Pyongyang" were everywhere. The factory's propaganda team also went to the streets, beating gongs and drums, shouting slogans, and parading in celebration. Workers at the Beijing Machine General Factory held a celebration meeting during the noon break. Worker Gao Yanchang imagined the despondent scene of the American imperialists after the liberation of Pyongyang and created a ballad, singing and performing, exposing Truman's ugliness, which was applauded by more than 300 workers. The workers of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, on the one hand, celebrated the victory of the people, and on the other hand, ridiculed the shameful failure of the invaders. Wang Chao from the telegraph department said: This time MacArthur is "ten thousand pieces"! The workers of the 7th Branch were so excited that they ran to the streets and wrote celebration slogans on the trolleybuses. After the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, the workers were even more confident in the final victory of the Korean War. They said: The final victory is definitely ours. The Liulihe Cement Factory was holding a celebration meeting for completing the annual task ahead of schedule, and the news of the liberation of Pyongyang further increased the workers' enthusiasm for production. Workers from the Waterworks Company, the Beijing Postal Administration, the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Xinji Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital also celebrated the liberation of Pyongyang with joy.
    After the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached the universities and middle schools in the capital, teachers, students, and staff members cheered and celebrated enthusiastically. Shouts, applause, and the sound of gongs and drums resounded in every corner of the schools. Teachers and students also posted congratulatory wall newspapers and paraded in the streets.
    Teachers and students from Peking University, Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Jiaotong University Beijing Branch, Huabei University of Technology, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts held victory parades in the streets on the evenings of the 6th and 7th respectively. On the evening of the 6th, as soon as the news of the liberation of Pyongyang reached Peking University, seven or eight students immediately organized a news report team to report the good news everywhere. Wherever the news report team went, the sound of cheers erupted like a volcano. More than 700 students immediately converged into a torrent, walking out of the school gate in rows of three, and joined with students living in other dormitories, setting off on parades in two routes. They shouted the good news of the liberation of Pyongyang with extreme excitement along the way. Passersby also stopped and cheered and applauded with them. People in shops with closed doors leaned out of the windows and shouted, "Celebrate the Liberation of Pyongyang!"
    More than 1,200 teachers and students from Fu Jen Catholic University paraded in the streets on the 7th with unparalleled excitement.
    Early in the morning on the 7th, students from Tsinghua University gathered around to read the news of the liberation of Pyongyang in the newspaper. General Xiao Hua was giving a report at Yenching University on the morning of the 7th. After the news of the liberation of Pyongyang came, the entire audience of more than 1,300 people immediately burst into stormy applause and cheers.
    Faculty, staff, and students of the Peking Union Medical College also celebrated this great victory with jubilation. Some professors said, "The liberation of Pyongyang is really exciting. This is a concrete manifestation of the collapse of American imperialism."
    In middle schools, in addition to Fu Jen Catholic Boys' and Girls' Middle Schools celebrating enthusiastically on campus, Municipal No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Girls' No. 3 Middle School, No. 11 Middle School, Hebei Advanced Industrial School, Hui Min College, Hebei Provincial Normal School, Normal University Affiliated Middle School, Normal University Girls' Affiliated Middle School, Beijing Normal School, Labor Middle School, Hui Wen Middle School, Xin Zhi Middle School, Da Tong Middle School, Hua Bei Middle School, Chong Ci Middle School, Xi Yin Middle School, Yu De Middle School and other middle schools, as well as industrial schools and financial schools, also held victory parades in the streets. Students explained the great significance of this victory to the masses by explaining cartoons and maps.
    These parade lines brought infinite excitement and joy to the people of the city, and were also warmly welcomed by the masses. People on the roadside applauded and shouted slogans along with the team, and some children automatically sang songs such as "The East is Red."
    On the 7th, the Korean Embassy and the Korean Central News Agency were also particularly lively. When the parade teams passed by here, they stopped to shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" "Long live the Korean people!" and "Long live the Korean People's Army!" Korean friends also shook hands cordially with the students, photographed the parade teams, and Ambassador Li Zhouyuan and the embassy secretary, counselor, and others personally came out to greet and thank them.
    When the students of Huabei University of Technology arrived at the Korean Embassy, Ambassador Li Zhouyuan spoke, representing the Korean people to pay tribute to the Chinese people, and pointed out: What we are doing now is a war against aggression, which is just. The final victory belongs to us. We will not only liberate Pyongyang, but also liberate the whole of Korea soon, and finally drive the American imperialists out of Korea! So that the people of all Asia can gain freedom and peace!
    Soldiers of a certain battalion of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Forces shouted happily after seeing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang in the newspaper. Many people rubbed their hands and said, "See if the American devils can still brag!" Yang Yi said, "I have long seen through this group of 'soft eggs' occupying Seoul and Pyongyang, just like the Kuomintang occupying our Yan'an." The soldiers of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Corps spent the day receiving the news of the liberation of Pyongyang with incomparable joy and excitement. After hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, many classes in the company immediately started small-scale forums. Gong Liansan, a soldier from the sixth class of a certain company, said: "This is a forewarning that the American imperialists will soon be beaten into the sea by the Chinese and Korean people." Yu Wenhan, the correspondent of the third company, said: "This is another powerful proof that justice will surely triumph over injustice. In the face of justice, the American aggressors will surely be swept away by the Chinese and Korean people." The soldiers who participated in the forum all resolutely expressed that they would support the Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteer Army with practical actions to defend the eternal security of the capital. The soldiers of the Second Company of the Guard Battalion of the North China Military Region scrambled to read the victorious news of the liberation of Pyongyang in the newspaper. Many people shouted and yelled happily. Qi Wencai, a soldier from the first class, said: "From this victory, I have seen through the paper tiger of the American empire even more, and I am more determined in my confidence in eliminating the American aggressors!" Sun Dahu, a soldier from the first class, said: "The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are really heroic. Although the American imperialists used many planes and cannons to fight, they still suffered a great defeat. It can be seen that the American empire is not terrible." Li Shuangcheng, a soldier from the Military Law Office of the North China Military Region, and the comrades of the third class all expressed the following opinions: The liberation of Pyongyang not only dealt a heavy blow to the American empire, but also gave a great lesson to the American aggressors' little partners, telling them that the end of being cannon fodder for the American empire is like this. Soldiers of a certain regiment took out the red, exquisitely made notebooks awarded to them by the Pingyuan Anyang Prefectural Committee during the Liberation War, carefully pasted photos of Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and wrote to the Korean People's Army stroke by stroke: "Dear comrades of the Korean People's Army; hearing of your victory is as joyful as if we ourselves had won a great victory on the battlefield. We will use the courage to eliminate the eight million American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek troops to fully support you. You have received the assistance of people all over the world, and the final victory must be yours."
    Wang Gong, a soldier on duty in the Political Department of the Navy, opened his mouth wide and laughed, shouting excitedly after receiving the newspaper: "Pyongyang is liberated!" "Pyongyang is liberated!" The cadres and soldiers who were eating breakfast couldn't wait to put down their bowls and chopsticks and rushed over in a swarm, vying to see the newspaper. The news of the liberation of Pyongyang, every word was like the five-star red light of Beijing East Railway Station at night, shining brightly into everyone's eyes, into everyone's hearts. For a time, the office was filled with excited and joyful cheers, some were happy to jump, and some were clutching the newspaper and cursing agitatedly in the crowd: "Damn American devils, let's see how much ability you have left!" Li Chunfa, a soldier from the guard class, said: "The Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army are really like a tiger with wings! This battle was really beautiful!"
    The news of the liberation of Pyongyang became the focus of conversation for all comrades in the headquarters of the North China Air Force. Han Jikui of the Political Department said: "The liberation of Pyongyang more fully demonstrates the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the American empire, and also demonstrates the strength of the people's power. Our Chinese and Korean people must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, advance steadily, and work harder to resolutely drive the American empire out of Asia!"
    [Report from our newspaper] Tianjin Daily telephone: The good news of the liberation of Pyongyang was transmitted, and the people of the city were jubilant and encouraged. The Chinese and Korean national flags were flying throughout the city, and the newspaper that day was sold out as soon as it was published. In addition to posting newspapers on the street, workers from various factories and students from various schools organized propaganda teams and Yangko teams to conduct publicity in various important streets, and many factories and schools held small-scale celebration meetings. The Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce also dispatched decorated publicity trucks.
    The Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression is scheduled to hold the "Tianjin City Celebration of the Liberation of Pyongyang" at the China Grand Theater at 2:00 pm on the 9th. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions is also scheduled to hold a celebration meeting on the same day.
    [Report from our newspaper] Northeast Daily telephone: After learning of the liberation of Pyongyang, people from all walks of life in Shenyang gathered and paraded on the 7th to hold grand celebrations. The national flags of China and Korea fluttered in the wind throughout the city. At the celebration meeting, all the staff of the Rubber No. 7 Factory unanimously guaranteed to complete this month's production tasks ahead of schedule. Workers at the Machinery No. 2 Factory launched a wave of condolences. Students from major universities and middle schools formed dozens of powerful lines, beating waist drums, shuttling through the main streets. Residents and industrialists and merchants in the city also gathered and paraded by district. The mood of the Korean people living in Shenyang was even higher. Li Guanming and Zhao Jinzhe, Korean employees working at the Dongnong Rubber Factory, and Korean farmers in the four suburbs also requested to return to their country to participate in the war.
