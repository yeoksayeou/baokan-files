Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Our correspondent reports from Pyongyang: A unit of the Korean People's Army, fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers to liberate Pyongyang, held a ceremony entering the city at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month. The entering troops, led by a military band playing "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The People's Army March," marched along Pyongyang's main street, Stalin Avenue, singing military songs. People gathered on the streets, shouting "Long live!" and showering the troops with flowers, colorful paper strips dancing above the parade. A mass rally was held immediately after the parade. Cadres of the Korean People's Army reported on the heroic deeds of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in combat, receiving a great welcome from the people. Despite enemy planes flying low overhead and dropping bombs on the east bank of the Daedong River, the people's enthusiasm was not diminished in the slightest. The people reunited with the People's Army after forty-eight days of separation. Forty-eight days is not a long time, but for the people of Pyongyang, who had endured the ravages of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, it was an extraordinarily long period of suffering. Therefore, when they saw the People's Army again, they were filled with tears and were particularly affectionate. When a reporter asked an old woman, who had been shouting "Long live!" from beginning to end, why she was so excited, she replied that her son and daughter-in-law had been killed by the American and Syngman Rhee bandits, and she demanded that the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers avenge her. People around her vied with each other to recount their own experiences. Some had relatives killed, some had sons or husbands separated, many had just fled back from the countryside, and some were "political prisoners" who had just escaped from prison during the chaos before the liberation. When people shouted slogans, their excitement was mixed with sobs. The people were not just welcoming a unit of troops, but welcoming their own loved ones, bidding farewell to suffering, and seeking revenge against the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, mass rallies have recently been held in many places in Korea to warmly respond to the "Letter to the People" issued by General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, on the liberation of Pyongyang.

The people of Myongchon County, North Hamgyong Province, which was recently liberated, held a mass rally to support General Kim Il-sung's "Letter to the People." After denouncing the atrocities committed by the American and Syngman Rhee bandits during the occupation, those present resolutely expressed their determination to bravely overcome all difficulties and strive for the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.

The people of Sonchon County, North Pyongan Province, resolved at a mass rally to intensify support for the front lines, increase agricultural production, do their best to restore the damaged enterprises, and unanimously passed a letter to pay their respects to General Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong.

In Tokchon, Maengsan, and Nyongwon in South Pyongan Province, and in Sinuiju, Chongju, Pokchon, Sakju, Nyongbyon, and Kuson in North Pyongan Province, and in North Hamgyong Province, South Hamgyong Province, and Jagang Province, factories, mines, enterprises, organs, and organizations also held mobilization meetings. At the meetings, the Korean people expressed their warm gratitude to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and vowed to completely drive the American aggressors out of Korea.

    朝鲜人民军举行平壤入城典礼            
    市民饱含热泪欢迎要求向美国强盗复仇            
    各地人民响应金日成号召加紧支援前线
    【新华社十八日讯】本社记者自平壤报道：与中国人民志愿军并肩作战解放平壤之朝鲜人民军某部，于本月十日下午五时举行入城典礼。入城部队以奏着“金日成将军之歌”、“人民军队进行曲”的军乐队为前导，高唱军歌，行经平壤的主要街道——斯大林大街。人民齐集街头，狂呼万岁，纷纷向部队献花，彩色纸条飞舞在游行队伍的头上。游行后即举行群众集会。朝鲜人民军的干部在会上报告了人民军与中国人民志愿军作战的英勇事迹，受到人民极大的欢迎。尽管敌机在头上低飞，在大同江东岸投弹，人民的热情也丝毫不为稍减。人民重见分别了四十八天的人民军，四十八天的日子不算长，但对于受尽美李匪帮蹂躏的平壤人民，却是异常漫长的苦难日月。所以当他们重见人民军时都饱含热泪，分外亲热。记者问一位自始至终都高喊万岁的老太婆为什么这样兴奋，她回答说：她的儿子和媳妇都被美李匪军杀死了，她要求人民军和中国人民志愿军替她报仇。在她旁边的人们都争着诉说自己的遭遇。有的亲人被杀死，有的儿子或丈夫离散，有许多人是刚从乡下逃难回来的，有一些并且是刚在解放前趁混乱中逃出牢狱的“政治犯”。人民喊口号时，在兴奋中混杂着哭声，人民不是一般地欢迎一支部队，而是欢迎自己的亲人，向苦难告别，向敌人复仇。
    【新华社十八日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜许多地方均于最近召开群众大会，热烈响应朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军就平壤解放所发表的告人民书。
    最近获得解放的咸镜北道明川县人民召开了支持金日成将军告人民书的群众大会。到会者在控诉美、李匪军占领下的暴行后，坚决地表示要勇敢克服一切困难，争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利。
    平安北道宣川县的人民，在群众大会上决议加紧支援前线，提高农业生产，尽力恢复被破坏的事业，并一致通过上书金日成将军及毛泽东主席致敬。
    在平安南道的德川、孟山、宁远，平安北道的新义州、定州、博川、朔州、宁边、龟城等地，在咸镜北道、咸镜南道和慈江道，各工厂、矿山、企业机关和团体，也都召开了动员大会。会上朝鲜人民对英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队表示热烈的感谢，并立誓要把美国侵略者完全驱出朝鲜。
