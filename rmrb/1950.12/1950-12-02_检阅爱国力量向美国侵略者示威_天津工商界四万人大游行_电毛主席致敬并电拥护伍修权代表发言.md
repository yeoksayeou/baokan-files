    [This Newspaper's Report] On November 30th, more than 42,900 industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin solemnly held a demonstration parade to resist American aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country. This is unprecedented in the nearly hundred-year history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism. On this day, the people of Tianjin were inspired by this patriotic action. All the city's shops hung national flags. At around 10 a.m., the temperature was -2.6 degrees Celsius, but the mood of every participant in the parade was as fiery as fire. The teams from various industries, like iron streams, began pouring into the First Stadium. The gathering was completed at 1:40 p.m. People were beating gongs and drums and singing songs in the wind and sand, with high morale. The venue was filled with red flags, and countless slogans and signs with vows were held high. Millions of people with one heart waited for the commander-in-chief to issue the order to depart.

    Before the departure, the General Commander of the Conference, Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, read a telegram to Chairman Mao and a telegram to Representative Wu Xiuquan in front of the microphone. On behalf of more than 40,000 industrialists and businessmen, he reported to Chairman Mao with the strongest will: "Today we held a demonstration parade of more than 40,000 people again to tell the American imperialists that the Chinese people have recognized their nature, and all sectors of the country have united to fight to the end to complete the sacred task of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and defending the country!" The industrialists and businessmen present unanimously supported the just accusation made by Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the People's Republic of China, against the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan at the UN Security Council on November 28th, and resolutely demanded that the UN Security Council accept the three proposals put forward by Representative Wu Xiuquan and impose severe sanctions on the US imperialist armed aggression. More than 40,000 people passed this resolution with stormy applause. After Chairman Li Zhuchen finally read the congratulatory telegram from the Democratic National Construction Association to the conference, he issued the order to start the parade. The majestic team flowed into the city in a mighty manner in the military music of "Unity is Strength". The long line did not pass the reviewing stand until 5:50 p.m. Huang Jing, the mayor who was invited to participate in the review, Zhou Shutao, the deputy mayor, Wu Yanhong, the secretary-general, and other heads of various agencies have been standing on the reviewing stand to review this army against imperialism. Tianjin has really become one of the powerful cities resisting American aggression and aiding Korea today. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, the industrialists and businessmen of New China are also closely united. The sea-like team not only showed the strength of the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, but also showed the strength of the people of Tianjin.

    The parade was led by Li Zhuchen, the chairman who was already in his seventies, leading all the vice-chairmen as a guide. There were old men in their seventies and young men in their teens in the team; there were managers, shopkeepers, accountants, and apprentices; there were engineers and technicians. They united together to carry out anti-imperialist parades and demonstrations in the central park and the French garden, which were once the privileged areas of the imperialists, but where have the imperialists gone today? Get out! It will never be possible to come back!

    The first squadron of the first brigade of the parade was composed of 600 people from the Film and Theater Industry Association. They marched forward with their heads held high. The members of the chorus team, composed of more than 100 people, were neatly dressed and energetic, singing along the way, singing the anger of the Chinese people. In addition, the hand drum team in white clothes and white pants, red hair knots, red scarves, and red belts, as well as the disguised Truman, MacArthur, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee, were the most eye-catching. The trailing team was a brigade composed of more than 3,000 vendors. They shouted loudly: "Resist American aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country!"

    For the whole afternoon, the crowds watching the parade on both sides of every street the team passed were so crowded that it was really a sensation. The masses gave warm applause to the parade from time to time. Whether in the parade or in the welcoming crowd, everyone's face had a solemn and firm expression, intertwined with resentment and the confidence and joy of being sure of victory.

    The Tianjin Progressive Daily published an editorial entitled "Solemn Oath-Taking of Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles". The editorial said: "It is no accident that Chinese industrialists and businessmen have such patriotic determination. The experience of the past century has been tragic. Today, as long as you think about it carefully, no one will deny that the butcher who sits on the ground and divides the spoils is the US imperialism. It has harmed the development of Chinese industry and commerce, but it is still pretending to be charitable and trying to deceive to the end." However, the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin have recognized the essence of US imperialism and have taken action. The editorial concluded: "The demonstration parade of the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin can be said to represent the solemn oath of the people of Tianjin to the whole country. We, the people of this industrial and commercial city, support the joint declaration of the democratic parties across the country. We want to expand and launch the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country. We will resolutely implement the four guarantees put forward by the industrial and commercial circles for this sacred task. At the same time, our industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin must also take "high quality and low price" as the production goal and create greater results in the patriotic competition."

    检阅爱国力量向美国侵略者示威
    天津工商界四万人大游行
    电毛主席致敬并电拥护伍修权代表发言
    【本报讯】十一月三十日天津市四万二千九百余工商业者，庄严地举行了抗美援朝、保家卫国的示威大游行。这在近百年来中国人民反对帝国主义斗争中是史无前例的。天津全市人民在这一天都为这个爱国行动所振奋，全市商店都悬挂着国旗，上午十点多钟，气温是零下二点六度，但每一个参加游行者的心情却是火样的炽烈，各行业的队伍像铁流般地即开始向第一体育场涌进，到下午一时四十分集合完毕。人们在风沙中敲锣打鼓唱着歌，情绪高昂。会场上红旗招展，无数写着誓言的标语、口号字牌，高高举起。千万人一颗心，等待着总指挥发布出发的命令。
    出发前大会总指挥、工商联主委李烛尘，在麦克风前宣读致毛主席电和致伍修权代表电，他代表着四万多工商业者用最坚强的意志向毛主席报告：“今天我们又举行了四万余人的示威大游行，告诉美帝，我们中国人民已经认清了它们的本质，全国各阶层都已团结一致，共同为完成抗美援朝保家卫国这一神圣任务而斗争到底！”与会工商业者一致拥护中华人民共和国代表伍修权十一月二十八日在联合国安理会上对美帝侵略台湾的正义控诉，并坚决要求联合国安理会接受伍修权代表所提出的三项建议，对美帝武装侵略的行动，加以严厉的制裁。四万多人用暴风雨般的掌声通过了这项决议。在李烛尘主委最后宣读了民主建国会对大会的贺电后，即发布了出发游行的命令。雄壮的队伍在“团结就是力量”的军乐声中，浩浩荡荡流向市区，漫长的行列，直到五点五十分才从检阅台前通过完毕。被邀参加检阅的黄敬市长、周叔韬副市长及吴砚农秘书长等各机关首长一直站在检阅台上检阅着这支反抗帝国主义的大军。天津今天真的变成了抗美援朝的有力城市之一了。在毛泽东的旗帜下，新中国的工商业者也紧紧地团结起来了。海潮般的队伍不但显示出天津工商业界的力量，也显示出天津人民的力量。
    游行队伍以年已古稀的老人李烛尘主委率领全体副主委作先导，队伍中有七十岁的老头，有十几岁的小伙子；有经理、有掌柜、有账房先生、有小徒弟；有工程师，有技术员。他们团结在一起，在当年曾经是帝国主义者的特权区域的中心公园、法国花园这块土地上作反帝游行示威了，但今天帝国主义者们那里去了？滚蛋了！永远也不可能再回来了！
    游行队伍的第一大队第一中队是由影剧业同业公会六百人所组成，他们昂首挺胸，齐步前进。队中一百多人组成的歌咏队队员服装整齐，精神焕发，沿途引吭高歌，唱出了中国人民的愤怒。另外白衣白裤、红发结、红领巾、红腰带的手鼓队，以及化装的狼狈的杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、蒋介石、李承晚等最引人注目。殿后的队伍是三千余摊贩组成的大队，他们响亮地喊出：“抗美援朝、保家卫国！”
    一整个下午，大队经过的每一条街道两旁，争看游行队伍的群众挤得水泄不通，真是万人空巷。群众对游行队伍不时报以热烈的掌声。无论从游行的行列里，或在欢迎的群众里，每个人的脸上都有着庄严而坚决的表情，交织着愤恨和胜利在握的信心与愉快。
    天津进步日报为此发表了题为“天津工商界庄严的誓师”的社论。社论中说：“中国工商业者有这样爱国决心不是偶然的。百年来的经历是惨痛的，到今天只要是仔细地想过，便没有人不承认这个坐地分赃的刽子手，就是美帝国主义，他危害了中国工商业的发展，却还在伪装慈善，企图欺骗到底。”但，天津的工商业界已认识了美帝的本质，行动起来了。社论最后说：“天津工商界的示威大游行，可以说是代表了天津人民向全国的郑重宣誓。我们这个工商业城市的人民，拥护全国各民主党派联合宣言。我们要扩大与展开抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。我们坚决执行工商界为了这一神圣任务而提出的四项保证。同时我们天津工商业者更要以“物美价廉”为生产目标，在爱国主义竞赛中，创造更大的成果。”
