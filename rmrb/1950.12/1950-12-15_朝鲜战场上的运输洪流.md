    The Transport Torrent on the Korean Battlefield
    ·Xu Ping·
    [Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Korea] This reporter, Xu Ping, a correspondent with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reports: In the snow-covered mountains of northern Korea, countless transport torrents, composed of trucks, horse-drawn carriages, sleds, and people, are moving. They endure the bitter cold and snow of minus thirty degrees Celsius, overcome enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, and transport various supplies to the front lines.
    In this transport torrent composed of people and vehicles, there are the transport units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, farmers from Northeast China volunteering to resist America and aid Korea, and the brave and unyielding Korean men and women.
    The truck drivers of the People's Volunteer Army transport units, who are responsible for the main transport work, work day and night. Their slogan is: "Don't let a single person be idle, don't let a single truck be idle, load quickly, unload quickly, transport quickly, and support the comrades on the front lines to win victories!" They lie on the cold ground during the day to rush to repair vehicles, and at night they transport supplies with red eyes. The tense tasks make them forget rest and sleep. They drive cars without lights in the dark, with their eyes wide open, gripping the steering wheel tightly, staring at every steep slope and bend, and driving cautiously. Trucks loaded with supplies pass through winding and steep mountain roads, one after another, non-stop heading to the front line, and then quickly turn back to load again.
    The staff in the rear of the battle line are also busy with the task of loading and transporting supplies. They carry supplies from rugged mountain roads to near the highway. If the mountain road is too steep, they use their backpacks to pad themselves and slide down. The female comrades also automatically undertake tasks such as guarding supplies, cooking, and sewing sacks, replacing the male comrades to do the carrying work. The Korean people automatically packed the grain from their homes, loaded it on their sleds, and sent it to the front lines, and actively participated in the transport work. Many gray-haired old men and women led their grandchildren to repair bridges and roads for the Volunteer Army's transport units. They held all available primitive tools—sickles, small axes, shovels, even small knives— braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing in broad daylight, repairing roads damaged by enemy aircraft, and filling in ditches beside the road to widen the road surface. They organized "repair teams" and "grain transport teams," many of which mobilized the entire family. The reporter personally saw that in a place where the house had been bombed into a pile of rubble, the owner of the house and his entire family were repairing the road for the troops. When enemy planes flew over their heads, they only looked up for a moment, and then bravely continued to repair and dig. Watching the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers advance, their eyes contained glistening tears, shining with gratitude.

    朝鲜战场上的运输洪流
    ·徐平·
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地电】本社随中国人民志愿军通讯员徐平报道：在被风雪封锁着的朝鲜北部的群山中，穿行着无数条由汽车、马车、雪橇和人群汇集成的运输洪流。他们忍受着零下三十度的严寒风雪，战胜了敌机的轰炸和扫射，把各种物资源源地运上前线。
    在这人车组成的运输洪流里，有中国人民志愿军的运输部队，有来自中国东北志愿抗美援朝的农民，也有着英勇不屈的朝鲜男女人民。
    担负着主要运输工作的人民志愿军运输部队的汽车驾驶员们整日整夜地工作着。他们的口号是：“不闲一个人，不闲一辆车，快装、快卸、快运，支援前线同志打胜仗！”他们白天躺在冰冷的地上突击检修车辆，到晚上就瞪着一双红眼运输物资。紧张的任务，使他们忘了休息和睡觉。他们在黑夜里驾驶着灭了灯的汽车，睁圆了眼睛，握紧了驾驶盘，盯住每一处陡坡、弯道，小心谨慎地开驶着。满载着物资的汽车，通过弯曲陡峭的山路，一辆接着一辆不停息地奔向前线，又迅速地转回来再装运。
    在战线后方的工作人员，也紧张地担任着装运物资的工作。他们从崎岖的山道中把物资背运到公路附近。山路太陡就用背包垫在身下往下滑。女同志们也自动担任守护物资、做饭、缝麻袋等任务，把男同志替换出去作背运工作。朝鲜人民自动地将家中的粮食包好，装在自己的雪橇上送往前线，并且积极地参加了运输工作。很多白发苍苍的老大爷、老大娘领着自己的孙子、孙女给志愿军的运输部队修桥补路。他们手里拿着一切可以利用的原始工具——镰刀、小斧、铁锹、甚至小刀，大白天冒着敌机的轰炸、扫射，修补着被敌机破坏的道路，填平路旁的水沟以加宽路面。他们组织起“修复队”、“运粮队”，很多是全家动员。记者曾亲眼看见在房屋已被炸成一堆瓦砾的地方，那房屋的主人全家都在给部队修路。敌机飞到他们头上盘旋，他们只抬头看了一下，接着便勇敢地继续修挖。他们看着中国人民志愿军战士前进，眼中包含着晶莹的泪水，闪耀着感激的光辉。
