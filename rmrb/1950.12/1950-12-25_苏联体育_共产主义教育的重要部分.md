    In the future, children above a certain age can enjoy education that combines intellectual education, physical education, and productive labor. This education is not only a way to increase social production but also the only way to cultivate comprehensively developed individuals. (Note 1)      —Marx

    It is particularly beneficial to widely develop sports and exercise among the people because it can discipline people, strengthen their physique, stimulate initiative and activeness, and teach people to cooperate. In short, if you want to cultivate healthy, strong, agile, resourceful, and courageous people who are good at overcoming difficulties and confidently face the future, then sports and exercise are very important factors. (Note 2)
                  —Kalinin
  (I)
    In the socialist country of the Soviet Union, sports have become an indispensable and important part of the lives of the broad masses of people and have become a mass social movement. Millions of workers, peasants, office workers, and students throughout the Soviet Union enthusiastically love and actively participate in sports activities. At the beginning of 1949, there were 11 million people in the Soviet Union regularly participating in sports activities, about 3 million people doing track and field, more than 1 million people playing football, more than 1 million people playing volleyball, and 500,000 people playing basketball. By the end of 1950, the total number of Soviet athletes had reached 14 million.

    The achievements of Soviet sports have exceeded the highest levels in the capitalist world. In 1949, Soviet athletes set 421 new national records and broke 33 world records. In the first four months of 1950, another 75 domestic records were broken. At the beginning of 1950, out of the 295 world records registered by international sports organizations in track and field, swimming, weightlifting, shooting, skating, cycling, and motorcycling, the Soviet Union accounted for 66, becoming the country with the most world records. In various international ball game competitions, the Soviet Union has also won victories and championships, becoming the world and European champion.

    Enterprises, collective farms, institutions, and schools in the Soviet Union generally have sports organizations. These grassroots organizations form national sports associations according to the production and administrative system. There are now more than 40 such sports associations. The most numerous and famous sports associations are "Dynamo," "Spartak," "Lokomotiv," "Torpedo," "Metallurgist," "Labor Reserves," "Collective Farm," and "Science." For example, the "Spartak" sports association in the cooperative system has 8,000 grassroots organizations and 280,000 members, accounting for 16 percent of all cooperative staff. It regularly holds training and competitions in 36 sports such as track and field, ball games, swimming, horse racing, etc. It has 50 large stadiums, 90 gymnasiums, and thousands of basketball courts throughout the Soviet Union, as well as cycling and equestrian fields.

    In the Soviet Union, the honorary titles of outstanding athletes and sports workers with special merits are "Honored Master of Sports" and "Honored Athlete." They enjoy the respect and love of the Soviet people, just like Stakhanovite workers, advanced workers in socialist agriculture, writers, artists, and scientists.

  (II)
    The reason why Soviet sports have achieved such a large scale and high level of achievement is rooted in the incomparable superiority of the socialist social system and is inseparable from the great care and wise leadership of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin, and Comrade Stalin.

    After the October Revolution, during the period of foreign military intervention and domestic war, under the leadership of Comrade Lenin, the Soviet government established the Military Training Administration in 1918, emphasizing both sports and military affairs. Comrade Lenin pointed out: "Sports are of great significance in military training." And despite financial difficulties, a sports training class was established in 1919. Later, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) made a resolution in 1925, pointing out that sports are one of the important means of uniting and educating the masses. It was decided to organize various sports groups to unite workers and peasants, establish a central government sports agency to lead sports groups, and stipulate the tasks of trade unions and the Communist Youth League regarding sports work. In 1929, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) summarized various achievements in Soviet sports in another resolution and criticized its shortcomings, such as the lack of mass participation in sports, the small authority of sports leadership institutions, and the lack of centralized leadership. Therefore, it proposed the decision to improve the All-Union sports leadership institution.

    The slogan Comrade Stalin wrote for the "Dynamo" sports venue after the war: "Young men and women athletes, I hope you will work hard to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years! I hope you will work hard to improve your skills, break all sports records, and strive for the glory of Soviet sports!" Comrade Molotov said at a reception for athletes held in the Kremlin in 1947: "We hope that there will be more Soviet athletes and that we will train a large number of ordinary athletes, because in the end, everything will be solved by ordinary athletes and the mass participation in sports."

    According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Soviet government established the All-Union Sports Affairs Committee under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in 1936, and established sports affairs committees at all levels of the Soviets in the Councils of Ministers of various republics, and in various regions, states, provinces, cities, and districts to uniformly lead sports work. The Soviet government has created many perfect facilities and material conditions for the sports activities of millions of working people. By 1949, more than 600 stadiums, more than 18,000 sports fields, 60,000 volleyball and basketball courts, 9,000 ski stations, and 550 water sports stadiums had been established in the Soviet Union. These places are all large-scale and well-equipped. In order to train sports cadres, there are now three sports research institutes, five sports research institutes, thirteen sports universities, thirty-two physical education departments in normal universities, forty secondary sports schools, as well as correspondence departments, correspondence courses, training courses for sports leaders, refresher courses for teachers, and instructor specialized courses. The government has allocated huge amounts of funds for sports activities. In the 1950 Soviet national budget, 2.2 billion rubles (accounting for more than 5 percent of total expenditures) were used for health and sports. Various Soviet republics and trade unions have also increased a lot of funds for sports expenditures.

  (III)
    Unlike capitalist countries that regard sports as entertainment for a few rulers and wealthy people, the Soviet Union regards sports as an important part of communist education. It is listed as one of the five components of communist education, along with intellectual education, aesthetic education, technical education, and moral education. Soviet sports are aimed at strengthening the health of the working people and the defense capabilities of the socialist country, preparing the working people to move towards highly productive labor, and helping to educate Soviet people with communism, defend the socialist motherland, actively build communism, and strive to complete the immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin.

    Soviet sports cultivate the excellent qualities of healthy, agile, capable, and hardworking Soviet people among the masses of people, thereby serving production labor and national defense construction. Facts have proved that Soviet sports have played a huge role on the production front and the national defense front.

    After the October Revolution, the production volume of Soviet factories and rural areas increased dozens of times, and sports are one of the many factors that promote the increase in production. Soviet scholar Lesgaft said: "Sports improve labor productivity." The outstanding swimmer and welder Alexander has exceeded the production plan by 170 to 200 percent. A worker at the Moscow Sickle and Hammer Factory is an excellent skier and a hero of the Stakhanov movement. A large number of sports workers and athletes in factories and collective farms have already completed the 1950 production plan ahead of schedule and are already working for the 1951 and even later plans.

    The Great Patriotic War was a severe test for the entire Soviet people and millions of athletes. At the beginning of the war, hundreds of thousands of athletes joined the battle, and they showed excellent qualities of endurance, strength, agility, perseverance, and full confidence in victory in the battle. Noskov (swimmer), Shcherbakov (boxer), Belov (wrestler), Shadov (weightlifter), Klyukova (female skier), and thousands of athletes have received the titles of heroes and medals. The ski unit composed of students from the "Lenin and Lesgaft" Sports Academy gave the German invaders a serious blow on the northern and western fronts. During the battles in the North Caucasus in 1942-43 and later during the counter-offensive, the division composed of athletes and mountaineers in the Karpat Mountains also made significant contributions.

  (IV)
    Precisely because sports can cultivate the excellent qualities of the people, enable their physical and spiritual development in an all-round way, and play a great role in promoting production labor and national defense construction, the Soviet Council of Ministers approved the "Labor and Defense" system ("ГТО") project, standards, and implementation measures in 1939 and carried it out throughout the Soviet Union. The current "Labor and Defense" system is divided into three types: "Preparing for Labor and Defense," for young people aged 14 to 15; "Labor and Defense" Level 1, for nationals aged 16 and above; "Labor and Defense" Level 2, for nationals aged 17 and above. The projects at all levels include different sports activities, divided into compulsory and elective categories. The compulsory projects include the basic parts of various sports, and the elective projects are some other sports that can give play to speed, flexibility, and endurance, and other projects can be selected under this principle according to the conditions of various regions and nationalities. The compulsory basic projects at all levels include gymnastics, running, obstacles, swimming, and skiing, while the elective projects include long-distance running, jumping, skating, ball games, throwing, and even diving, cycling, equestrian, mountaineering, rowing, weightlifting, boxing, and wrestling. The performance standards of the projects vary according to the level and the gender and age of the participants. People who pass the test and meet the standards can get the badge of "Labor and Defense" at all levels. The "Labor and Defense" standard is raised every three years. This sports system developed on the basis of the people's voluntary participation has become a mass movement for the Soviet people to train themselves to meet the needs of the country.

    Now the teaching materials of physical education classes in Soviet primary and secondary schools are compiled according to the standards of the compulsory projects of the "Labor and Defense" system, and its elective projects are used as the basis for extracurricular sports in schools. That is to say, school sports are based on the "Labor and Defense" system as the basic teaching material. The grassroots sports organizations of various factories, farms, troops, institutions, and schools must conduct "Labor and Defense" system training and testing. By 1949, more than 3 million Soviet people had reached the first level of "Labor and Defense," and more than 300,000 had reached the second level.

    In Soviet sports, the athlete ranking system is of the same importance as the "Labor and Defense" system. In 1934, the Soviet government awarded the title of Honored Master of Sports to reward sports workers with special merits. In 1935, it was decided to award the title of Honored Athlete to athletes who created world records and All-Union records. This further developed into a national reward system for athlete ranking. In 43 sports, it is divided into six levels according to the achievements achieved: (1) Honored Athlete, (2) Master of Sports, (3) First-Class Athlete, (4) Second-Class Athlete, (5) Third-Class Athlete, (6) Fourth-Class Athlete. Among them, the fourth level is the youth level. Young men and women under the age of 17 with excellent sports achievements can obtain this title, and its standard is lower than the third level. The standard is increased according to the level. The first level and above are "Master of Sports" and "Honored Athlete." The title of "Master of Sports" is already difficult to obtain because its level is close to the All-Union record, and the Honored Athlete must be someone who has created world records and All-Union records.

    It can be said that the "Labor and Defense" system is a means of popularizing Soviet sports, and the athlete ranking reward system is a method of improving Soviet sports. These two systems have played a huge role in promoting Soviet sports to reach today's high level of achievement. These two systems have an inseparable relationship, because only on the basis of popularization can improvement be achieved. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, the athlete ranking system was implemented only after the "Labor and Defense" system had been promoted for a period of time and achieved results. In order to obtain the title of athlete rank, one must first pass the "Labor and Defense" system test. For example, a Master of Sports must first obtain the qualification of the second level of "Labor and Defense." This is because everyone must first have the conditions for comprehensive physical development before they can specialize in a sport and achieve better results.

    苏联体育——共产主义教育的重要部分
    在将来，一定年龄以上的儿童，皆可享受把智育、体育和生产劳动结合起来的教育，这种教育不仅是增加社会生产的方法，而且是培养出全面发展的人的唯一的方法。（注一）              ——马克思
    在人民中广泛发展体育和运动是特别有益的，因为这可以使人们纪律化，增强人们的体质，可以激发自动精神和主动性，教会人们去协同动作。一言以蔽之，若要培养出健康、强壮、灵敏、机智、勇敢，既善于克服困难，又卓有信心正视前面的人，则体育和运动乃是很重要的因素。（注二）
                  ——加里宁
  （一）
    在社会主义国家苏联，体育已经成为广大人民生活中不可缺少的重要部分，已经成为广大群众性的社会运动。全苏联千百万工人、农民、职员和学生，都热烈爱好并积极参加体育运动。一九四九年初在苏联有一千一百万人经常正规地参加体育活动，约有三百多万人作田径运动，一百多万人作足球运动，一百多万人作排球运动，五十万人作篮球运动。到一九五○年末，苏联运动家的总数已经达到一千四百万人。
    苏联体育运动的成绩，已经超过资本主义世界最高的水平。在一九四九年内，苏联运动家有四二一项创造了全国新纪录，有三十三项打破了世界纪录。在一九五○年头四个月中，又有七十五项打破了国内纪录。在一九五○年初体育国际组织所登记的田径、游泳、举重、射击、溜冰、自行车、摩托车等比赛的二百九十五项世界纪录中，苏联即占六十六项，成为保持世界纪录最多的国家。在历次各种国际球类比赛中，苏联也都获得胜利并取得各项冠军，成为世界和欧洲的优胜者。
    苏联的各企业、集体农场、机关和学校中都普遍设有着体育运动的团体，这些基层组织，按照生产和行政的系统组成各个全国性的体育协会，这种体育协会现在已有四十多个，人数最多和最有名的体育协会有“迪那摩”、“斯巴达克”、“洛克莫基夫”、“托尔别多”、“冶金者”、“劳动后备队”、“集体农场”、“科学”等。如合作社系统的“斯巴达克”体育协会在全苏有基层组织八千个，会员二十八万人，占全体合作社工作人员的百分之十六。经常举办田径、球类、游泳、赛马……等三十六种运动的训练和竞赛。它在全苏各地设有大运动场五十处、体育馆九十处、上千个篮球场，另外还有自行车比赛场及骑术场等。
    在苏联，成绩优秀的运动员有特殊功绩的体育工作者的光荣称号是“功勋体育家”和“功勋运动员”。他们同斯达哈诺夫式工作者、社会主义农业的先进者、作家、艺术家、科学家等同样享有苏联人民的尊重与敬爱。
  （二）
    苏联体育事业之所以获得了这样巨大的规模和高度的成就，是根源于社会主义社会制度的无比优越性，是和布尔什维克党、列宁、斯大林同志的伟大关怀和英明领导分不开的。
    十月革命后，在外国军事干涉和国内战争时期，在列宁同志领导下，一九一八年苏维埃政府成立了军事训练管理局，将体育和军事并重。列宁同志并指出：“体育在军事训练中是有重大意义的。”并且尽管在财政困难的情况下，于一九一九年创设了体育训练班。其后，在斯大林同志的领导下，联共中央于一九二五年做出决议，指出体育是团结群众和教育群众的重要手段之一，决定组织各种体育团体以团结工农群众，建立政府的中央体育机关以领导体育团体，并规定了职工会和共青团关于体育工作的任务。一九二九年，联共中央在另一次决议中总结了苏联体育运动中的各种成就，并批评了它的缺点，如体育运动的群众性还不够，体育领导机构权限太小及领导不够集中等，从而提出健全全苏体育领导机构的决定。
    斯大林同志在战后给“迪那摩”运动场所写的标语：“青年男女健儿们，希望你们努力锻炼，把五年计划，四年完成！希望你们努力提高技术，打破一切运动纪录，争取苏联的体育光荣！”莫洛托夫同志于一九四七年在克里姆林宫招待体育家的大会上说：“我们希望苏联的运动家再增多一些，大量培养普通运动家，因为最后的结果仍是以普通运动家及运动的群众化解决一切。”
    根据联共中央决议，苏联政府于一九三六年在全苏部长会议下面设立了全苏体育运动事务委员会，并在各共和国部长会议、及各地区、州、省、城市、区的各级苏维埃设立各给体育运动事务委员会，统一领导体育工作。苏联政府为千百万劳动人民的体育活动创设了许多完善的设备和物质条件。到一九四九年在苏联已经建立了六百所以上的体育场，一万八千处以上的运动场，六万处排球场和篮球场，九千处滑雪站，五百五十处水上体育场等。而这些场所都是规模巨大和设备完善的。为了培养体育干部，现在苏联已有体育研究院三所，体育研究所五处，体育大学十三所，师范大学体育系三十二处，中等体育学校四十处以及函授系、函授科、体育领导工作者讲习班、教员进修班、指导员专科等机构。政府为体育运动的经费拨付了巨额的款项，一九五○年苏联国家预算内有二十二亿卢布（占总支出百分之五强）作为保健体育的用途。苏联各共和国及各工会也增拨了大量资金作为体育的支出。
  （三）
    和资本主义国家把体育运动作为专供少数统治者和有钱人消遣的娱乐品不同，苏联是把体育当作共产主义教育的重要部分。它和智力教育、美学教育、技术教育及道德教育并列为共产主义教育的五个组成部分之一。苏联体育运动是为了加强劳动人民的健康及社会主义国家的防御力量，是劳动人民走向高度生产劳动的准备，是协助以共产主义教育苏维埃的人们，捍卫社会主义祖国，积极建设共产主义，努力完成列宁——斯大林不朽事业的重要方法之一。
    苏联体育在人民群众中培养健康的、精敏强干和刻苦耐劳的苏维埃人的优良品质，从而为生产劳动和国防建设服务。事实证明，苏联体育在生产战线和国防战线上起了极大的作用。
    十月革命以后苏联工厂和农村的生产量增加了几十倍，而体育即是促进生产上升的许多因素之一。苏联学者列斯格夫说：“体育提高了劳动生产力”。杰出的游泳家、焊工亚力山大曾超过生产计划百分之一七○到百分之二○○。莫斯科镰刀锤工厂的一个工人，是优秀的滑雪家同时是斯达哈诺夫运动的英雄。为数众多的体育工作者和运动员们，在工厂和集体农场里，都早就提前完成了一九五○年的生产计划，而已在为一九五一年乃至更以后时期的计划而工作了。
    伟大卫国战争是苏联全体人民和几百万体育家的严重考验。战争开始时，数十万体育家参加了战斗，他们在战斗中表现了忍耐、坚强、机敏、刚毅和有充分胜利信心的优良品质。诺斯考夫（游泳家）、施哥巴客夫（拳击家）、贝诺夫（角力家）、沙多夫（负重家）、克拉克娃（女滑雪家）及成千成万的运动员，都得到英雄的称号和奖章。由“列宁和列斯查夫特”体育学院学生所组成的滑雪部队，在北战线和西战线都神出鬼没地给德寇以严重的打击，一九四二——四三年在北高加索的战斗中以及后来反攻时期中，卡尔巴特山区由体育家——登山家所组成的师团也是曾立下显著战功的部队。
  （四）
    正因为体育运动能够培养人民优良品质，使他们的身体和精神获得全面发展，在促进生产劳动和国防建设上有很大的作用，苏联部长会议于一九三九年批准了“劳动卫国”制（“гто”）的项目、标准及实施办法，在全苏进行。现在的“劳动卫国”制分为三种：“准备劳动卫国”，十四岁至十五岁的少年参加此级测验；“劳动卫国”第一级，十六岁以上的国民参加；“劳动卫国”第二级，十七岁以上国民参加。各级的项目，包括不同的体育活动内容，分必修的和选修的两种。必修的项目包含各种运动的基本部分，选修的项目则是能够发挥速度性、灵活性和耐久性的一些其他运动，并可以在这个原则下依据各地区和各民族的情况而选用另外的项目。各级的必修基本项目包括体操、赛跑、障碍、游泳和滑雪，而选修项目中则有长跑、跳跃、滑冰、球类、投掷以至跳水、自行车、骑术、登山、赛船、举重、拳斗和角力等。项目的成绩标准则依级别及参加者的性别和年龄而有不同的规定。经过测验合于标准的人就可以得到“劳动卫国”各级的徽章。“劳动卫国”的标准，每隔三年提高一次。这个在人民自愿基础上发展起来的体育制度，已经成为苏联人民要把自己锻炼成适合国家需要的一种群众运动。
    现在苏联中小学体育正课的教材就是按照“劳动卫国”制必修项目的标准编制的，其选修项目则作为学校课外运动的根据。这就是说学校体育，是以“劳动卫国”制的项目做为基本教材。各工厂、农庄、部队、机关及学校的体育基层组织都要进行“劳动卫国”制的训练和测验。到一九四九年，苏联人民达到“劳动卫国”第一级的已有三百多万人，达到第二级的已有三十多万人。
    在苏联体育中，与“劳动卫国”制有着同样重要意义的是运动员等级制度。一九三四年苏联政府为奖励有特殊功绩的体育工作者而授给功勋体育家称号，一九三五年又决定对创造世界纪录和全苏纪录的运动选手也授予功勋运动家称号，由此进而发展成为运动员等级划分的国家奖励制度。在四十三种运动中依照所达到的成绩分为六级：（１）功勋运动家，（２）运动健将，（３）一级运动员，（４）二级运动员，（５）三级运动员，（６）四级运动员。其中第四级是青年级，十七岁以下的男女青年运动成绩优良的可以获得这种称号，其标准低于第三级，标准依级提高，第一级以上即为“运动健将”和“功勋运动员”。“运动健将”的称号则已很难得到，因其水平已接近全苏纪录，而功勋运动员则必须是创造世界纪录和全苏纪录的人。
    可以这样说，“劳动卫国”制是苏联体育运动的普及手段，而运动员等级奖励制则是苏联体育运动提高的方法。这两个制度在推动苏联体育达到今天的高度成就，曾起了极大的作用。这两种制度有着不可分的关系，因为只有在普及的基础上才能提高。所以，在苏联是首先推行“劳动卫国”制有了一段时期和成效以后才实行运动员等级制，而个人要获得运动员等级称号也必须先通过“劳动卫国”制的测验，例如运动健将就必须先获得“劳动卫国”第二级的资格。这是因为每个人必须先具备身体全面发展的条件，然后才可专门一项运动，和获得较好的成绩。
    （注一）恩格斯在《反杜林论》中曾引马克思的话，批评杜林对体育的无视和无知。马克思在《资本论》第十三章中讲到这问题。
