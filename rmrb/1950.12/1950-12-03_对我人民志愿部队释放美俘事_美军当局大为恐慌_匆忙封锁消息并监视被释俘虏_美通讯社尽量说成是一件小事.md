Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The fact that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army humanely treated American prisoners of war has greatly alarmed the American aggressor military authorities. Associated Press reporters Whitehead and Balease admitted in a November 23rd report that the released American prisoners said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army "treated them very well." They received the same rations as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army used their limited equipment to treat these wounded soldiers. "The Chinese do not search American soldiers' pockets and allow them to keep their cigarettes, watches, and other personal belongings."

These fragmentary reports from the released American prisoners of war regarding the truth of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's humane treatment of prisoners of war have caused great panic among the American military authorities. Associated Press reporter Erickson worriedly said on the 23rd that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's "humane and generous" treatment of prisoners of war "would have a huge psychological impact on the American public." Therefore, the American military authorities hurriedly imposed a temporary news blackout and monitored the released prisoners. According to the Associated Press: "Press representatives were prohibited from visiting or photographing the released prisoners, and all officers were ordered not to disclose information about the release, saying it was 'extremely secret'." Agence France-Presse also stated: The release of the prisoners "caused extreme unease in some departments under MacArthur. They did withhold the news for thirty-eight hours, and the American Information Service even requested that the most meaningful details be prohibited from publication. The heads of American news agencies tried to downplay it as a minor matter. ... On the other hand, wherever these twenty-seven American prisoners of war went, they were accompanied by an American general and three colonels, as if they were being taken care of very well." Obviously, these prisoners have been deprived of their freedom by the American military authorities simply because they told some of the truth.

    对我人民志愿部队释放美俘事
    美军当局大为恐慌
    匆忙封锁消息并监视被释俘虏  美通讯社尽量说成是一件小事
    【新华社二日讯】中国人民志愿部队人道地宽待美军战俘的事实，使美国侵略者军事当局大为恐慌。美联社记者怀特亥和白伶丝十一月二十三日在报道中承认：被释放的美国俘虏说：中国人民志愿部队“待他们很好”。他们得到和中国人民志愿部队一样的口粮。中国人民志愿部队曾用他们有限的设备治疗这些伤兵。“中国人不搜美国士兵的口袋，并且让他们留着他们的香烟、表和其他私人的东西。”
    这些被释放的美军战俘关于中国人民志愿部队宽待战俘真相的一些片断报告，引起了美国军事当局的极大恐慌。美联社记者艾里克森二十三日担心地说：中国人民志愿部队“人道而宽大地”对待俘虏，“会在美国公众中产生一种巨大的心理上的影响。”因此，美国军事当局急忙地临时封锁消息，并对被释俘虏加以监视。据美联社称：“报界的代表们被禁止访问被释俘虏或向其摄影，所有军官们奉令不得泄漏关于释放的消息，只说这是‘极端秘密’。”法新社也称：俘虏的释放“使麦克阿瑟下面的一些部门极度的不安。他们确是把消息扣压了三十八小时，美国新闻处甚至要求禁止发表最有意义的详细情况。美国的通讯社的首脑们尽量地把这说成一件小事情。………另一方面，这二十七个美国战俘走到任何地方，都有一个美国将军和三个上校陪着，好像是非常照顾他们似的。”显然地，这些俘虏们仅仅因为说了一些实话，已被美国军事当局剥夺了自由。
