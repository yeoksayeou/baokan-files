We believe that the people of Shanghai can completely rely on their own efforts to run their own relief and welfare undertakings well." Then, Chen Qiyuan, director of the Supervisory Committee of the China People's Relief Association, spoke. He called on Chinese welfare workers to go to the Korean front to serve the Chinese and Korean soldiers; those in the rear should strengthen their work in comforting, donating to, and conducting current affairs propaganda for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.

The congress also elected Kwei Yen-fang, Zhao Puchu, Wu Yaozong, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Hengbi and 34 others to form the Shanghai Relief and Welfare Anti-American Aid Korea Protect Home and Defend the Country Work Committee.

After the meeting, all the participants gathered at Longmen Road outside the Shanghai Race Club in the city center to begin the parade. The parade was led by the presidium.
