To the Editorial Staff:

When we heard the shameless speeches made by the American imperialist representatives Dulles and Austin successively at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, especially when we saw that the speeches maliciously mentioned the "aid" to Tsinghua University, every student felt extremely resentful.

Austin and Dulles, you gang of robbers and swindlers, listen: Tsinghua University was not built with American "aid" at all. The "Boxer Indemnity" was the blood and sweat property of the Chinese people that was plundered by the imperialists after slaughtering the Chinese people during the anti-imperialist struggles in the late Qing Dynasty. Every blade of grass and tree in Tsinghua University was built by the labor of the Chinese people. You cannot turn black into white and talk nonsense. The so-called "relief" and "aid" are just the malicious deception of criminals denounced by our people.

In your country, more than ten million unemployed workers live in extreme poverty. Why don't your American government's so-called "philanthropists" go to "relieve" and "aid" them? So many people (especially black people) do not have hospitals to see doctors or schools for their children to attend. Why doesn't your American government "aid" them? Why do you have to come all the way to China to run hospitals and schools? Your hearts are really "too good." We fully know that this is your soft knife that kills without drawing blood. You want to dilute the blood shed by the Chinese people under the hard knives of American imperialism, weaken the hatred for American imperialism, and you also want to cultivate your internal spies who will invade China – like Hu Shih and Chiang Ting-fu, this small group of shameless lackeys. Ugly and cunning swindlers, cry out, because your deception has long gone bankrupt.

Under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese students have long distinguished between friends and enemies. During the Anti-Japanese War, we knew who supplied gasoline to the Japanese robbers to fly planes and warships to our country, and who sold scrap iron and cotton to the Japanese robbers to make guns and bombs to slaughter our parents, brothers, and sisters. We also remember who supported Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out the anti-people war. Now your planes are bombing and strafing our people, and the hatred of forcibly occupying Taiwan with military force has not yet been avenged (even in Tsinghua University, there are still craters left by American bombs when they bombed during the early days of liberation). Now that we have heard your rogue and insidious nonsense, new and old hatreds have all come to our hearts together, and we can't wait to tear you robbers into pieces!

We, the students of Tsinghua University, have participated in the anti-imperialist student movements since the "December 9th" and "December 1st" "Anti-Violence" movements. In this movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we have also contributed our greatest strength. Now our vast number of students are enthusiastically responding to the government's call to participate in military cadre schools and actively studying the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Student Federation, as well as the relevant editorials in the People's Daily, in order to better understand the great significance of this call and the glorious tasks of young students. Many students are already eagerly awaiting the registration date to arrive. This is our best answer to thugs like Austin.

Editorial Staff, we hope that students from all schools in the country who have been similarly tainted by the vicious words of the Austin thugs will issue protests and give these thugs a severe blow.

With best regards,

All students of Tsinghua University

### 清华大学全体学生致函本报  奥斯汀所谓“友谊”“资助”是杀人不见血的软刀子

    清华大学全体学生致函本报
    奥斯汀所谓“友谊”“资助”是杀人不见血的软刀子编辑同志：
    当我们听到美帝代表杜勒斯、奥斯汀先后在联大政委会和安理会上发表的无耻演说的消息，尤其看到演说中恶意的提到“资助”清华大学的时候，我们每个同学都感觉无比的愤恨。
    奥斯汀及杜勒斯，你们这批强盗兼骗子们听着：清华大学根本不是什么美国“资助”建立起来的，“庚子赔款”是帝国主义屠杀满清时代进行反帝斗争的中国人民后，掠夺去的中国人民的血汗财产。清华大学的一草一木都是中国人民的劳动建立起来的，你们不能变黑为白地胡说，所谓“救济”“资助”只是被我们人民控诉的罪犯的恶意欺骗而已。
    在你们国家中，有着一千多万的失业工人过着极其贫困的生活，你们美国政府所谓的“慈善家”为什么不去“救济”“资助”一下，多少人民（尤其是黑人）没有医院可以治病，没有学校可以让他们的子女上学，你们美国政府为什么也不“资助”一下，为什么你们偏偏要不远万里地到中国来办医院，办学校，你们的心肠真是“太好”了。我们完全知道，这是你们杀人不见血的软刀子，你们想冲淡中国人民在美帝硬刀子下所流的鲜血，削弱对美帝的仇恨，你们还想培养你们侵略中国的内奸——像胡适之、蒋廷黻这一小撮无耻的奴才。丑恶狡诈的骗子们，你们号哭吧，因为你们的欺骗早已破产了。
    中国学生在中国共产党的领导和教育下早已分清了敌友。抗日战争时期，我们知道是谁把汽油供给日本强盗开飞机、兵舰到我国，是谁卖给日本强盗废铁、棉花，来制成枪炮炸弹，屠杀我国的父母兄妹。我们更记得是谁支持着蒋介石进行反人民的战争。现在你们的飞机轰炸扫射我国人民，武力强占台湾的仇还没有报（单单在清华园里还有你们美国的炸弹在解放初期轰炸时留下的土坑未平），现在我们听了你们无赖阴毒的鬼话，新仇旧恨就更一齐勾上心来，恨不得把你们这些强盗碎尸万段！
    我们，清华大学的学生曾经参加了“一二九”“一二一”“抗暴”以来的反帝学运，在这次抗美援朝运动中我们也贡献了自己最大的力量，现在我们广大的同学正热烈地响应政府参加军事干部学校的号召，积极学习中国新民主主义青年团团中央及全国学联的号召，和人民日报上有关的社论，借以更好地认清这个号召的重大意义及青年学生的光荣任务，并且已有很多的同学急不及待地等候着报名的日子到来，这是我们对奥斯汀之类的匪徒的最好的答复。
    编辑同志，我们希望全国和我们同样被奥斯汀匪徒恶言所污的学校学生，都发出抗议，给这些匪徒以狠狠的打击。致敬礼
                                          清华大学全体同学上
