    Sichuan Guangyuan Catholics Issue Declaration
    Catholics Begin Self-Reliance and Renovation
    Resolutely Severing Ties with Imperialists
    [This Newspaper's Report] More than 500 Catholics and over 200 Christians in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, respectively issued the "Declaration of the Self-Reliance and Renovation Movement" and a declaration responding to "The Path of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China" at the end of November. They firmly stated their determination to sever ties with imperialism in all aspects, practice self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and resolve to strive for the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China.
    The full text of the Guangyuan Catholic Self-Reliance and Renovation Movement Declaration is as follows: Catholic brothers and sisters in various places:
    After Catholicism was introduced into China, imperialists used the church in every possible way as a vanguard for aggression. For example, France used the killing of missionaries as a pretext to launch wars of aggression, and after the war, it expressly stipulated "special privileges for missionaries in China" in unequal treaties, consciously carrying out conspiracies of sabotage. The most egregious was American imperialism, which used money and various petty favors to lure people in the church, with the intention of controlling the Chinese church as an organization for long-term aggression and sabotage against our country.
    Now our independent, democratic, and free New China has been established. However, imperialists hate the people's liberation and deliberately expand the war of aggression, ignoring repeated warnings from the peace-loving people of China, and burning the flames of war to the northeastern border of our country, bombing peaceful cities and killing innocent compatriots. Therefore, based on our position of loving the motherland and loving the people, we are determined to sever all ties with imperialists and eradicate pro-American, fear-American, and fawn-American thoughts. We will rely on our own efforts to establish a new church of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. We will not allow the sanctity of the church to be stained by imperialism again.
    Brothers and sisters, in order to get rid of the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression, we should more actively support the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country with practical actions, consolidate the world's democratic and peaceful camp, and jointly strive for the construction of a New China.
    We held a conference on November 30th and invited local leaders to come and give guidance. All the Catholics present enthusiastically supported this movement and wish you to actively respond to ensure the success of this movement, and give us your good experiences at any time.

    四川广元天主教徒发表宣言
    天主教徒开始自立革新 
    坚决与帝国主义者割断关系
    【本报讯】川北广元县五百多位天主教徒，二百多位基督教徒于十一月底分别发表“自立革新运动宣言”及响应“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”宣言，坚决表示在各方面与帝国主义割断关系，实行自治、自养、自传，用实际行动抗美援朝，并决心为建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗。
    广元天主教自立革新运动宣言原文如下：各地天主教教友们：
    天主教传入中国以后，帝国主义者即百般利用教会，作为侵略的先锋。如法国借口教士被杀而发动侵略战争，战后更在不平等条约上明文载定“在华传教特权”，有意识地进行阴谋破坏。尤以美帝国主义为甚，在教会中用金钱和各种不同的小恩小惠诱惑，其用意是要把持中国教会，作为长期对我国进行侵略破坏的机构。
    现在我们独立民主自由的新中国建立起来了。可是帝国主义者仇视人民翻身，蓄意扩大侵略战争，不顾全中国爱好和平人民屡次的警告，把战火烧到我国东北边境，轰炸和平城市，杀害无辜同胞，因此我们基于爱祖国爱人民的立场上，坚决与帝国主义者割断各方面的关系，并肃清亲美、恐美、媚美的思想。自力更生，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。不让教会的圣洁，再受帝国主义的沾污。
    教友们，我们为要摆脱帝国主义者的阴谋侵略，更应当积极地以实际行动支持抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，巩固世界民主和平阵营，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。
    我们已于十一月三十日召开大会，并请当地首长莅临指导，到会教友，全体热烈支持此一运动，愿你们积极响应，确保此一运动的成功，并将你们的良好经验，随时赐教。
