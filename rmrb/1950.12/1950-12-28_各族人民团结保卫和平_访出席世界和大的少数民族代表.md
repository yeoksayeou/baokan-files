    All Ethnic Groups Unite to Defend Peace
    Interviews with Minority Representatives Attending the World Peace Congress
    By our reporters Jin Feng and Bai Sheng
    "This is the first time in history that ethnic minorities have sent their own representatives to such a grand international gathering! Ethnic minorities have truly stood up and become masters of the country! This is the glory of the ethnic minorities, this is the glory of Chairman Mao!" The words of Miao elder Ou Baichuan resonated with the other representatives. "Before, many national representatives didn't know about our Uyghur people," said the tall Uyghur representative Saifulaev. "They also didn't know where the Uyghur people were in China. It wasn't until I drew a map of Xinjiang—the Tianshan Mountains—that they suddenly understood. But our Uyghur people have a population of over four million and a history of over two thousand years!" Inner Mongolian representative Yun Shubi gently said from the side: "Chairman Mao liberated us and introduced us to the people of the world!"

    The Chinese ethnic minority representatives who were introduced to the people of the world by Chairman Mao, when they came to Warsaw and saw 1,756 representatives from 80 countries around the world shouting out the same voice in different languages—"Peace"—they deeply understood that peace would surely triumph over war. As Uyghur representative Saifulaev said: "Defending peace is the wish of the vast majority of people in the world, and the war-mongers are isolated and will surely fail." They heard the voices condemning MacArthur at the meeting, and the jeers at that shameful Titoist running dog Rodich, and the isolated predicament of the war-mongers was vividly before their eyes. And the world's people's ardent desire for peace was evidenced by the representatives of 80 countries at the conference, by the 500 million peace signatories, by the bloodstained shirt of the Uruguayan young peace fighter (the bloodstained shirt of a young student who sacrificed himself for the peace movement) at the conference, and by the Polish men, women, and children, who stood tirelessly at the entrance of the Peace Congress venue day and night, paying tribute to the peace warriors from all over the world. The brutal massacre of the Polish people by fascist Germany aroused the greatest anger of the Chinese ethnic minority representatives. The Hitler fascist bandits massacred nearly a quarter of the Polish population—seven million people, and every Polish family lost their loved ones! Right next to the Chinese delegation was the friendly Polish youth who was serving as a receptionist; he had lost both of his parents. Also serving as a receptionist was that Polish woman who looked so gentle and calm; she had lost her husband and three sons. Who can measure the grief and anger of that mother and wife, who can measure the grief and anger of the families of that quarter of the population? How could the Polish people and the people of the world not ardently desire peace and defend peace with the greatest strength?!

    After the Peace Congress, the Chinese delegation visited the fascist killing factory—Auschwitz-Birkenau. There, four million people had been killed, most of whom were Jews. The ethnic minority representatives in the delegation remembered with sorrow and indignation the persecution, massacres, and discrimination they had suffered at the hands of the Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Lin Sanliang, the representative of the Gaoshan people, lingered in front of the killing factory for a long time. He couldn't help but think of the Wushe Incident in 1930. That time, the Japanese imperialists used airplanes and cannons to attack the unarmed Gaoshan people, massacring tens of thousands of people. He couldn't help but think of the February 28th Incident in 1947, when the Kuomintang reactionaries used the same vicious methods to massacre tens of thousands of Taiwanese people. What made him even more painful was that he knew that the blood of the Taiwanese people was still flowing in Taiwan! They also thought of the discrimination and massacres of black people and all people of color by the American imperialists, and of the massacres the American imperialists were carrying out in Korea. These disciples and grandchildren of Hitler must be eliminated to ensure their happy lives after liberation.

    "The Chinese people have truly stood up," said Long Jieren, the bright-eyed young leader of the Aci ethnic group, with profound meaning as he recalled the welcome the Chinese delegation received at the Peace Congress. Mr. Ma, the Hui representative, raised his voice and said loudly: "Our Chinese proposals have all been included in the resolutions of the Congress. Chinese representatives participated in all seven committees of the Congress." He pointed to Miao elder Ou Baichuan with one hand and said: "Elder Ou and I participated in the Political Committee." He burst out laughing, and several young representatives followed suit, and the hall was filled with happy laughter.

    They also talked with boasting and pride about how "Mao Zedong," which had once been the common language of their ethnic groups, had also become one of the common languages of the 80 countries at the Peace Congress. Wherever the Chinese delegation appeared, there was a burst of cheers of "Mao Zedong." Representatives from Europe and America found it difficult to distinguish between the representatives of Asian countries, just as Chinese representatives found it difficult to distinguish between British and French representatives. The Congress used the cry of "Mao Zedong" to refer to all Chinese representatives. Speaking of this, their faces radiated the happy brilliance of being people of the New China.

    Lin Sanliang, the representative of the Gaoshan people from the Taiwan region awaiting liberation, was deeply moved to see that the representatives of all countries unanimously demanded that the American imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from Taiwan and unanimously supported the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan. He emphasized each word one by one: "Peace is not isolated, and the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan Province is not isolated either, it is supported by the people of the world!"

    Huang Xiang, the Tibetan representative from the newly liberated region, dispelled many ideological concerns after going abroad to participate in the Peace Congress. When the Northwest was first liberated, some Tibetans had the idea that "the Chinese revolution should be carried out in two steps—the first step is to implement New Democracy, which they have seen with their own eyes and think is good; the second step is to implement socialism, which they are afraid will be terrible." This time, Huang Xiang went abroad to the Soviet Union, which is implementing socialism. He first paid attention to the issue of religion. Because he had heard in Labrang that "the Communist Party now talks about religious freedom, but it won't in the future." When he arrived in the Soviet Union, he saw that there was still religious freedom. At the Peace Congress, he also saw with his own eyes the white-bearded Bishop Nikolai of the Soviet Union. This made him breathe a first sigh of relief. In the Tibetan area, he had also heard that "the Communist Party advocates that those who do not work shall not eat." He himself was an old man, and he secretly worried about the lives of old people who could not work. After arriving in the Soviet Union, he saw that old people had pensions and were fully taken care of by the social insurance department, which made him breathe a second sigh of relief. In Beijing, he visited schools and factories and thought they were the most ideal places in the world. When he arrived in Moscow, he was so surprised that he couldn't speak. Thus, the Tibetan elder Huang Xiang came to the conclusion: "This second step—socialism—is indeed extraordinary. It's not terribly scary, but terribly good!" In this way, he looked forward to that "second step" coming sooner.

    "We must expand the propaganda of the peace movement, actively engage in construction, and organically link the two." Uyghur representative Saifulaev, seeing the achievements of the Peace Congress and the construction of the Soviet Union, immediately thought of his own tasks. "We must publicize such peace to the people—that all ethnic groups unite more closely around the Communist Party and the People's Government, strictly guard against special agents and spies, and actively engage in construction. This is peace in action, active peace!" This tall Uyghur representative said with great force.

    Yun Shubi, the Inner Mongolian representative who established an autonomous government under the leadership of the Communist Party of China—the daughter of Yun Ze, chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, and Aci representative Long Jieren—chairman of the Aci Autonomous Region People's Government, paid more attention to absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries in construction. After visiting Poland and the Soviet Union, they gained confidence in building a happy new life in the now seemingly desolate Inner Mongolian desert and the Xishan and Guishan mountains. They saw that since the Polish people had restored the city of Warsaw, which had been 80 percent destroyed, in three years, and since the Soviet Union had built beautiful cities in the desolate Siberia, then the desolate Mongolian desert and the Xishan and Guishan mountains where the Aci ethnic group lived could certainly do the same!

    "We must bring the resolutions of the Peace Congress to every corner of the Miao area, we must expand the peace signature campaign in the Miao area, and we must enable the Miao compatriots to participate in the great patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country with practical actions," Miao elder Ou Baichuan enthusiastically said all his wishes in one breath. Then he added with a smile: "I will set off for Guiyang tomorrow!" Hui elder Ma Peiqing also said excitedly: "Like Elder Ou, I will also set off immediately to go back to the Northwest and tell our Hui compatriots."

    各族人民团结保卫和平
    访出席世界和大的少数民族代表
    本报记者  金凤  柏生
    “这是少数民族破天荒第一次派出自己的代表，参加这样隆重的世界性的集会！少数民族真是站起来了，做了国家的主人翁了！这是少数民族的光荣，这是毛主席的光荣！”苗族老人欧百川的话，引起了其他代表的共鸣。“以前许多国家代表不知道我们维族”，高大的维族代表赛甫拉已夫说：“他们也不知道维族在中国什么地方。等到我画出新疆——天山的地图，他们才恍然大悟。可是我们维族有四百多万人口，二千多年的历史呵！”内蒙代表云曙碧在一旁轻轻地说：“毛主席解放了我们，把我们介绍给全世界的人民了！”
    被毛主席介绍给全世界人民的中国少数民族代表，当他们来到华沙，看到世界上八十个国家、一千七百五十六位代表用着不同的语言喊出共同的声音——“和平”时，他们深深懂得了和平一定战胜战争。正如维族代表赛甫拉已夫所说：“保卫和平是世界上绝大多数人民的愿望，战争贩子们是孤立的，一定要失败的。”他们听到会场上谴责麦克阿瑟的声音，嘘叱那可耻的铁托走狗罗奇的声音，战争贩子们孤立的窘态就活现在他们的眼前。而世界人民对于和平的热切的企求，有大会上八十个国家的代表为证，有五亿和平签名者为证，有大会上乌拉圭青年和平战士的血衣（一个为了和平运动而牺牲的青年学生的血衣）为证，还有那日夜伫立在和大会场门口，不疲倦地向着来自世界各处的和平战士致敬的波兰男女老少为证。波兰人民所受法西斯德国的残酷屠杀，激起中国少数民族代表的最大愤怒。希特勒法西斯匪帮屠杀了波兰近四分之一的人口——七百万，每个波兰家庭都丧失了自己的亲人！就在中国代表团身边，那位担任招待的亲切的波兰青年，他丧失了他的双亲；也是担任招待的那位看上去那样温和平静的波兰妇女，她丧失了她的丈夫和三个儿子。谁能衡量那位母亲和妻子的悲痛和愤怒，谁能衡量那四分之一人口的家庭的悲痛和愤怒？波兰人民和全世界人民怎么能不热烈企求和平和用最大的力量保卫和平？！
    和大开会以后，中国代表团曾去参观了法西斯的杀人工厂——奥斯威辛·勃莱秦卡。那里曾经杀死了四百万人口，其中大部分是犹太人。代表团中的少数民族代表，悲愤地想起日本帝国主义者和国民党反动派对他们的迫害、屠杀和歧视。那高山族的代表林三良，久久地在那杀人工厂前面徘徊着。他不能不想起，一九三○年的雾社大惨案。那一次，日本帝国主义以飞机、大炮向着徒手的高山族人民进攻，屠杀了好几万人。他又不能不想起一九四七年的二、二八惨案，国民党反动派以同样的毒辣手段，屠杀了几万台湾人民。使他更痛苦的是他知道现在在台湾，还正流着台湾人民的鲜血！他们也想到美帝国主义者的歧视和屠杀黑人和一切有色人种，想起美帝正在朝鲜进行的屠杀。必须消灭这些希特勒的徒子徒孙，才能确保他们被解放后的幸福生活。
    “中国人民真正站起来了”，眸子明亮的阿西族人民的青年领袖龙介仁，回忆着和大中国代表团所受到的欢迎时，含意深长地说。回族代表马老先生提高了嗓子大声说：“我们中国的提议，都列入了大会的决议。和大七个委员会，都有中国代表参加。”他一手指着苗族老人欧百川说：“欧老和我，就参加了政治委员会。”他放声大笑起来，几个年轻的代表随着哄笑起来，满堂洋溢着一片快乐的笑声。
    他们又带着夸耀和骄傲，谈起了曾经作为他们各族人民共同语言的“毛泽东”，也成为和大八十个国家的共同语言之一。中国代表团出现在那里，那里就响起一片“毛泽东”的欢呼。欧美洲的代表不容易分辨亚洲各国的代表，正如中国代表难以分辨英国代表和法国代表一样。大会用“毛泽东”的呼号来称呼一切中国代表。说到这里，他们的脸上，就焕发出作为新中国人民的幸福的光彩。
    待解放地区的台湾高山族代表林三良看到世界各国的代表一致要求美帝国主义侵略军队退出台湾，一致支持中国人民解放台湾的决心，不由得十分感动。他一个字一个字着重地说：“和平不是孤立的，中国人民要解放台湾省也不是孤立的，是有着全世界人民的支援的！”
    新解放地区的藏族代表黄祥，此次出国参加和大以后，解除了很多思想顾虑。西北初解放时，部分藏民有这样一种想法：“中国革命要分两步走——第一步实行新民主主义，他们亲眼看到了，觉得是好的；第二步要实行社会主义，恐怕不得了”。这次黄祥出国，到了实行社会主义的苏联。他首先注意宗教问题。因为他在拉卜楞听说过“共产党现在讲宗教自由，将来就不啦”。他到苏联一看，还是宗教自由。在和大会议上，他又亲眼见到苏联的白须飘拂的尼古拉大主教。这就使他松了第一口气。在藏区他又听说“共产党主张不劳动者不得食”，他自己是老人，就暗暗担心不能劳动的老人的生活问题。到苏联以后，一看老人有着养老金和社会保险部充分的照顾，这就使他松了第二口气。在北京他参观了学校、工厂，以为是世界上最理想的地方。到莫斯科一看，简直使他惊奇得说不出话来。于是，这位藏族老人黄祥就下个结论：“这第二步——社会主义果然不得了。不是可怕得不得了，而是好得不得了！”这样，他就盼望着那个“第二步”能快些来。
    “要扩大宣传和平运动，要积极从事建设，要把这二者有机地连系起来”。维族代表赛甫拉已夫，看到和大的成就和苏联的建设，立刻联想到自己的任务。“要向老百姓宣传那样的和平——各民族更紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，严防特务间谍，积极从事建设，这就是行动的和平，积极的和平！”这位高大的维族代表极有力量地说。
    在中国共产党的领导下建立了自治政府的内蒙代表云曙碧——内蒙自治政府主席云泽的姑娘和阿西代表——阿西自治区人民政府主席龙介人，更多注意吸取苏联和东欧人民民主国家建设的先进经验。在参观了波兰、苏联以后，他们对于在那现在看来是荒凉的内蒙沙漠和西山、圭山建设幸福的新生活有了信心。他们看到，既然波兰人民在三年内把毁灭了百分之八十的华沙城恢复起来，既然苏联在那荒凉的西伯利亚建立起一座座美丽的城市；那末，荒凉的蒙古沙漠和阿西族居住的西山、圭山，也一定可以这样做的！
    “要把和大决议带到苗区的每个角落，要在苗区扩大和平签名运动，要使苗族同胞以实际行动参加抗美援朝、保家卫国的伟大爱国主义运动”，苗族老人欧百川热情地一口气说完了他的心愿。又微笑着加了一句：“明天我就动身回贵阳去！”回族老人马培清也兴奋地说：“和欧老一样，我马上也要动身回西北去告诉我们回族同胞。”
