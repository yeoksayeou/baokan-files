The American imperialists are not only accustomed to openly aggressing against and plundering the Chinese people; at the same time, they are also accustomed to wearing a mask of "benevolence," taking a fraction of the blood and sweat they have extracted from the Chinese people to insidiously carry out the trick of so-called "relief" to the Chinese people in order to realize their aggressive schemes. The organizations through which American imperialism "bestowed" such sugar-coated poison on China, to name only recent ones, include the "United China Relief" during the Anti-Japanese War and the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), which infiltrated China after the surrender of the Japanese invaders and was manipulated by American imperialism. The Chinese people suffered deeply from and detested both of these organizations. In order to facilitate his masters' unbridled poisoning of the Chinese people, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek successively signed the "Relief Agreement" and the "Bilateral Agreement" with American imperialism in 1947 and 1948, selling out the interests of the Chinese people.

However, the "humanitarian" cloak of the American government has never been able to cover its fox's tail. Countless facts prove that the so-called "relief materials" and "relief agencies" of American imperialism were originally intended to help the Chiang bandits fight the civil war. In 1947, the Chiang bandits' criminal conspiracy to block the mouth of the Yellow River at Huayuankou in an attempt to flood the liberated areas was carried out with the support of UNRRA. UNRRA drafted a plan for the Chiang bandits, provided them with a large amount of equipment, materials, and personnel, and was responsible for all the work. This is one of the "achievements" of UNRRA, which claimed to use materials and equipment to "help" China carry out post-war economic reconstruction and "save" famine victims. UNRRA's crimes of helping the Chiang bandit gang fight the civil war with "relief" materials, in the period from October to November 1946 alone, according to incomplete statistics, included: Kuomintang bandit troops used 600 UNRRA vehicles to transport 1,200 war horses to Qingdao; around November 1st, Kuomintang bandit troops were discovered in a certain place north of Zhengzhou on the Pinghan Railway using 160 UNRRA freight cars to transport military equipment; in the battle north of Heze in early November, the People's Liberation Army captured 18 Kuomintang bandit military vehicles loaded with UNRRA flour.

The American government not only used UNRRA and its "relief" materials to help the Chiang bandit gang fight the civil war, but also used it to steal the sovereignty of the Chinese people. The first foreign ships to violate Chinese sovereignty by navigating the Yangtze River after the Japanese surrender were American ships under the pretext of transporting "relief" materials. These ships could then navigate to Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places, carrying "relief" materials and using the remaining tonnage to load American goods for dumping in China. As for the "Sino-American Relief Agreement" mentioned earlier, it is an ironclad proof of the United States' grabbing of the Chinese people's sovereignty in the name of "relief." In October 1947, in order to obtain the US Congress's approval of US $27.7 million under the "Foreign Relief Act" for its anti-people civil war, the Chiang bandit did not hesitate to sign the aforementioned traitorous agreement with the US government in Nanjing. This was a complete exposure of the Chiang bandit's open sale of the country for "relief" and American imperialism's open use of "relief" to aid the Chiang bandit in fighting the civil war and carrying out aggression. According to this agreement, the Chiang bandit could sell "relief" materials for money to use as capital for the civil war; American imperialism could send a huge "delegation" to China to openly collect military intelligence and explore China's economic resources throughout the country.

While American imperialism used the vast majority of "relief" materials to help the Chiang bandits massacre the Chinese people and carry out their aggressive schemes, it did not forget to deceive the Chinese people. For example, UNRRA, manipulated by the United States, claimed in its regulations that UNRRA's work was "regardless of political belief" and that all materials "should be distributed according to a non-discriminatory policy." This self-proclaimed "charitable" and "detached" tone was of course an attempt to cover up its essence of poisoning the Chinese people. But in fact, in addition to the facts listed above which are enough to smash this mask, even in terms of the so-called "distribution according to a non-discriminatory policy," American imperialism cannot justify itself. UNRRA transported materials to China, of which 98 percent were handed over to the Chiang bandit gang; however, the people in the liberated areas, who suffered the most severe damage from the Japanese invaders and puppet troops and accounted for two-thirds of the population in need of relief in the country, received only less than 2 percent of the total materials. This obvious contrast is a slap in the face to the so-called "non-discriminatory policy." Moreover, among the 98 percent of the total "relief" materials transported to China and handed over to the Chiang bandit gang, apart from the large amount used to help the Chiang bandit gang carry out the civil war as mentioned above, the remaining part was not really used to relieve the poor people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. On the contrary, these "relief" materials were first openly used to transfuse blood to the four major families. For example, in February 1947, the United States agreed to change the US $200 million used by UNRRA to purchase industrial and agricultural equipment to purchase American cotton and American wheat, so as to sell them in the Chinese market at a price of US $500 million. Later, the figures changed somewhat, but that was only a matter of bargaining between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek. After this matter was realized, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily exposed it at that time. The newspaper pointed out that the cotton that UNRRA transported to "relieve" the Chinese people was sold to Song Ziwen's "China Textile Company." In this transfer, American imperialism used "relief" materials to help the Chiang bandit replenish the raw materials of the bureaucratic capital "China Textile" to continue to plunder the Chinese people, and at the same time used the proceeds from the sale of "relief" materials to replenish the Chiang bandit's capital for the civil war to slaughter the Chinese people. At that time, even some UNRRA personnel were indignant and said: "Plows and hoes have finally been melted into swords." Such things were endless at that time. Secondly, even in the very few "relief" materials used for distribution, most of them were used to "relieve" two types of "refugees": one was the high-ranking "refugees" who, as UNRRA officials said, "wore silk clothes or suits, and returned fully loaded with the help of coolies and rickshaws," and the other was the reactionary landlords and despots who fled from the liberated areas to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. After these "relief" materials were subjected to these planned and ingenious "distributions," the small civil servants and teachers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also received some "relief," which was sour oatmeal, glass scrubbing boards...; in addition, citizens in seven major cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou also saw "relief" goods, which were the "household rice" or "household noodles" that the citizens of these cities often stood all day long and then squeezed their arms to buy.

Another insidious purpose of the "relief" undertaking carried out by American imperialism in an attempt to paralyze the Chinese people was to take the opportunity of "relief" to dump a large number of surplus materials to destroy China's national industry. One-sixth of the "relief" materials transported to China by the United States were surplus materials from the US military on Pacific islands and in Asia. These surplus US military materials not only included incomplete equipment and rotten food, but even medicines that had expired and produced toxins were transported to China. Recently, the unfortunate incidents of poisoning and death among railway workers in Hengyang due to taking sodium sulfate from the American "Post-War Relief Materials" received from the Kuomintang reactionary government is a clear proof. In addition to the aforementioned work of transfusing blood to the bureaucratic capital of the four major families, the crime of the United States using "relief" materials to destroy China's national industry was also carried out at that time through the "Fisheries Inspection Team" and "Sino-American Fisheries Company" organized by UNRRA, which it manipulated, and which operated everywhere along the Chinese coast and Hainan Island, seizing the privilege of fishing in Chinese territorial waters and openly dumping the fish caught, strangling China's fisheries production. The Shanghai fishing industry and dock workers have protested indignantly for this reason. More common was that "relief" materials became commodities filling the market in the appalling corruption of US-Chiang Kai-shek officials, crowding out domestic goods and suffocating the textile and food industries of the national capital in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time.

### 美帝是怎样“救济”中国人民的？

    美帝是怎样“救济”中国人民的？
    美帝国主义不仅惯于公开地对中国人民进行侵略和劫掠；同时，也惯于戴上“仁慈”的假面具，由中国人民身上剥削去的血汗中拿出几十万分之一来，阴险地施展所谓“救济”中国人民的伎俩，来实现它的侵略阴谋。美国帝国主义在中国“布施”这类外裹糖衣的毒药的机构，远的不谈，近的如抗日战争时期的“美国援华联合会”，日寇投降后渗入中国而由美国帝国主义操纵的“联合国善后救济总署”，都是中国人民身受其害而深恶痛绝的。蒋匪介石为便于其主子肆无忌惮地荼毒中国人民，并曾于一九四七年和一九四八年先后与美国帝国主义签订了出卖中国人民利益的“救济协定”和“双边协定”。
    但是，美国政府的“人道主义”外衣，从来就遮盖不了它的狐狸尾巴。无数的事实证明：美国帝国主义的所谓“救济物资”和“救济机构”，原来是帮助蒋匪帮打内战的。一九四七年，蒋匪堵塞黄河花园口企图用水淹没解放区的罪恶阴谋，便是在“联总”的支持下进行的。“联总”为蒋匪拟好计划，并以大量器械、材料、人员供给了蒋匪，并负责了全部的工作事宜。这就是声称要用物资器材来“帮助”中国进行战后的经济复兴建设和“拯救”饥馑灾民的“联总”的“成绩”之一。“联总”以“救济”物资帮助蒋匪帮打内战的罪行，仅在一九四六年十月到十一月的期间内，据不完全的统计即有：国民党匪军曾用六百辆“联总”车辆运一千二百匹战马到青岛；约在十一月一日，平汉路郑州以北某地曾发现国民党匪军以一百六十辆“联总”货车，拖运军用装备；十一月初菏泽北部战斗中，解放军缴获十八辆满载“联总”面粉的国民党匪军军车。
    美国政府不仅利用“联总”及其“救济”物资帮助蒋匪帮打内战，并且也用它来盗取中国人民的主权。日本投降后首先破坏中国主权在长江内河航行的外国船只，就是借口装运“救济”物资的美国船只。这批船只当时可航行南京、芜湖、九江、汉口等地，运“救济”物资外，以所余大量吨位装载美国商品来中国倾销。至于前面提到过的“中美救济协定”，更是美国假“救济”之名来攫取中国人民主权的铁证。一九四七年十月，蒋匪为了取得美国国会通过“对外救济法案”项下的二千七百七十万美元以为反人民内战之用，不惜与美国政府在南京签订了上项卖国协定。这是蒋匪公开用“救济”卖国，美国帝国主义公开用“救济”援助蒋匪打内战并进行侵略的总暴露。根据这个协定，蒋匪可以将“救济”物资卖钱作内战资本；美国帝国主义可以派遣庞大的“代表团”来中国，明目张胆地在中国全境搜集军事情报及探测中国经济资源。
    美国帝国主义在以“救济”物资中的绝大部分帮助蒋匪屠杀中国人民并遂行其侵略阴谋的同时，不会忘记对中国人民进行欺骗工作。譬如美国操纵下的“联总”，曾在其规章中声称，“联总”的工作是“不分政治信仰的”，一切物资“应根据不歧视政策进行分配”。这种自命“慈善”和“超然”的腔调，当然是企图用来掩饰其毒害中国人民的本质。但是实际上，除前面所列举的事实已经足够击破这付假面具外，就在所谓“根据不歧视政策进行分配”这一点来看，美国帝国主义也无法自圆其说。“联总”运来中国物资，交与蒋匪帮的达全部物资的百分之九十八；但当时受日寇及伪军摧残破坏最严重的、占全国应受救济人口三分之二的解放区人民，却仅收到全部物资的百分之二弱。这一个显明的对比，是给予所谓“不歧视政策”的一记耳光。而且，“联总”交给蒋匪帮的运华全部“救济”物资的百分之九十八中，除掉前面所说的大量用在帮助蒋匪帮进行内战以外，剩下的一部分也并没有真正都用来救济国民党统治区中的贫苦人民。相反的，这些“救济”物资首先是公开地用来对四大家族进行输血的工作。如一九四七年二月，美国答应将“联总”购买工农业器材的二万万美元改购美棉和美麦，以便以五万万美元的价格在中国市场抛售。后来数字虽有些变动，但那仅是美蒋两方讨价还价的问题。此事实现后，当时上海文汇报曾予以揭露。该报指出：“联总”运来“救济”中国人民的棉花，都卖给了宋匪子文的“中国纺织公司”。这一转手间，美帝以“救济”物资帮助蒋匪补充了官僚资本“中纺”的原料以继续搜括中国人民，同时又以变卖“救济”物资的价款补充了蒋匪屠杀中国人民的内战资本，当时，就是“联总”的人员也曾有人愤慨地说：“犁锄终于被熔成了刀剑”。像这类事情，在当时是层出不穷的。其次，就在用于发放的极少数的一点“救济”物资中，也绝大部分是用来“救济”了两种“难民”：一种是“联总”官员所说的“身穿绸衣或西装，在苦力协助与人力车拖载之下，满载而归”的高等“难民”，另一种就是由解放区逃亡到国民党统治区的反动地主和恶霸。“救济”物资经过这些有计划的巧妙的“分配”后，国民党统治区的小公务员、教员也领到一些“救济”了，那就是发了酸的麦片、玻璃擦衣版……；此外，上海、广州等七个大城市的市民也看到“救济”品了，那就是这些城市的市民常常鹄站终日然后挤断臂膀去争购的“户口米”或“户口面”。
    美帝国主义妄图麻痹中国人民而进行的“救济”事业的另一个阴谋目的，就是借用“救济”之名，大量倾销剩余物资来摧残中国民族工业。美国运来中国的“救济”物资中，有六分之一是太平洋各岛屿和亚洲等地美军的剩余物资。这些美军剩余物资中，不仅包括有残缺不全的器材和腐朽的食品，并且连已失时效并发生毒素的药品也运到中国。最近，衡阳铁路职工因服用自国民党反动政府接收来的美国“善后救济物资”硫酸钠而中毒死亡的不幸事件相继发生，即是一个明证。美国利用“救济”物资来摧残中国民族工业的罪行，除前面所说的对四大家族官僚资本进行输血工作外，当时并通过其所操纵的“联总”组织“渔业视察团”和“中美渔业公司”，在中国沿海及海南岛到处活动，攫取在中国领海捕鱼的特权，并公开倾销所捕之鱼，扼杀了中国的渔业生产。上海渔业界和码头工人，都曾为此愤激地提出过抗议。更为普遍的，则是“救济”物资在美蒋官吏的骇人贪污行为中变成了充斥市场的商品，排斥了国货，窒息了当时国民党统治区的民族资本的纺织工业和食品工业。【新华社】
