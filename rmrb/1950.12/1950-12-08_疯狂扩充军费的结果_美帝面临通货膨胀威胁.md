    Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, December 5th: The London correspondent of the Dutch Communist Party's newspaper, "De Waarheid," stated: The U.S. dollar is already threatened by inflation. The correspondent wrote: As Truman demands an additional $18 billion for military purposes, financial circles are studying the consequences of this increase in military spending on the U.S. economy. A few days ago, the influential British magazine "The Economist" emphasized the significant signs of inflation in the United States, stating: Although people's purchasing power can still maintain its previous level, consumer debt has increased rapidly. It is recently learned that U.S. private debt has reached $57 billion.
    The correspondent stated: The words of Eugene Black, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Vice President of Chase Bank, are of great importance in this matter. Black stated in private talks with several members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee that the financial community fears the dollar will be threatened by inflation in the near future. Black pointed out that exports of consumer goods have fallen sharply in the last three months.
    The Korean War has greatly reduced the production of consumer goods; all of this has led to an increase in the prices of consumer goods in the United States. According to official statistics, the consumer price index has increased from 166 to 175 between January and December.
    Black emphasized that when income decreases, increased spending for military purposes threatens monetary stability. Black further stated: "Many factors indicate that a wave of inflation is expected in the near future, and its serious consequences will affect more than just the United States."

    疯狂扩充军费的结果
    美帝面临通货膨胀威胁
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社海牙五日讯：荷兰共产党机关报《真理报》驻伦敦记者称：美元已经受到通货膨胀的威胁了。该记者写道：在目前杜鲁门要求一百八十亿美元作为军事用途的额外拨款时，金融界正在研究增加新的军费会对美国经济造成什么结果。几天前，有影响的英国《经济学家》杂志曾强调指出美国通货膨胀的重大征兆说：虽然人民的购买力还能保持以前的水平，但消费者的负债已经迅速增加了。最近据悉美国私人负债已达五百七十亿元。
    该记者称：关于这件事情，美国国际复兴开发银行行长兼大通银行副行长布莱克所发表的话，有极大的重要性。布莱克在和美国参院财政委员会若干委员私人谈话时称：金融界忧惧美元在最近将来受到通货膨胀的威胁。布莱克指出：消费品的输出在最近三个月内已经猛烈降低。
    朝鲜战争使消费品的产量大量减少；所有这一切都造成了美国消费品价格的增加。根据官方的统计，从一月到十二月间消费品价格指数已经从一六六增加到一七五。
    据布莱克强调指出：当收入减少时，为军事用途而增加支出就要威胁到通货的稳定。布莱克进一步称：“有许多因素表明：预料在最近将来会有通货膨胀的浪潮，它的严重的后果影响所及将不止美国一国。”
