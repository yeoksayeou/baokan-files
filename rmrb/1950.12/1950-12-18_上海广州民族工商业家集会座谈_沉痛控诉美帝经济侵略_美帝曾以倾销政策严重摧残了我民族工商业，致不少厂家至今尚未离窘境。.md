Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th -- Shanghai's national industrialists and businessmen have recently gathered to denounce their suffering under American economic aggression before liberation. They deeply experienced from the facts: "American imperialism is the deadly enemy of our national industry and commerce!" The famous industrialist Liu Hongsheng said, "We all remember that as soon as the Anti-Japanese War was won, American goods poured into the Shanghai market like a tide, devastating our weak national industry and commerce!"

Jing Shuping, the person in charge of the United Tobacco Industry Company, showed unparalleled indignation when he mentioned the situation of the cigarette industry before liberation. He said: "After the victory against Japan, American cigarettes with brands such as 'Maris', 'Chesterfield', and 'Camel' poured into the Shanghai market in large quantities, taking away seven-tenths of the city's cigarette sales. Under this heavy blow, more than half of the city's eighty cigarette factories were forced to close down."

Large Quantities of Medicines and Sewing Machines Imported, Crushing Eight-Tenths of Factories

"The situation in the pharmaceutical industry before liberation was also very pitiful!" Chen Fenghao, general manager of China Pharmaceutical Company, said, "In 1946 alone, the total import of American medicines reached 18 million US dollars. In addition, there were 30,000 tons of so-called 'surplus medicines' shipped from Okinawa. The market was full of American medicines, causing more than 160 of the city's 200 pharmaceutical factories to close down at once."

Under the influence of American dumping and the depression of all industries, the situation of the machinery manufacturing industry was even more tragic. The factories that were shut down accounted for 80% of the industry's original factories. According to customs statistics, in the seventeen months after January 1946, more than 5,000 American-made sewing machines were imported, equivalent to more than two years of total production of sewing machine factories in the city at that time. During the same period, the import of American-made files reached 100,350 dozens, almost equivalent to the possible production of the city's file manufacturing industry for fourteen years and four months. Jin Mengxuan, manager of Lizhong Arts and Crafts Factory, which specializes in producing files, said with grief and indignation: "Until now, there are still a large number of American file inventories on the market, so our factory cannot quickly resume production."

Using Diplomatic Privileges to Carry Out Open Smuggling

In addition to controlling our customs and using low taxes to dump American goods, American imperialists also used the diplomatic privileges of "Allied Forces Supplies" and "tax-free and inspection-free" to carry out open smuggling, especially the smuggling of nylon stockings was the most rampant. Pu Muqi, manager of China Weaving Factory, complained: "Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there were still more than 240 silk stocking factories in the city, with a monthly output of about 100,000 dozens of silk stockings, and the production and sales were balanced. However, with the victory against Japan, a large number of American nylon stockings were smuggled in, and the industry was severely hit and collapsed. By the time of liberation, there were only 68 factories left, with a monthly output of more than 10,000 dozens, but they still could not sell them all. This shows that the economic aggression of American imperialism is even more vicious than that of Japan."

Taking Advantage of "Post-War Relief" to Carry Out Plunder in Disguise

American imperialists are accustomed to setting up various nice-sounding names for economic aggression against our country, and so-called "post-war relief" is one of them. Li Bolong, manager of Yuansheng Ranch, said: "It's not enough for American imperialism to dump dairy products in large quantities. It also used the name of 'helping China improve the breed of dairy cows' to transport 10,000 American dairy cows through the 'United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration'. These dairy cows passed through the hands of bureaucrat compradors such as Soong Mei-ling and others, and in the blink of an eye, they opened milk stalls, squeezing our dairy industry to the point of suffocation." Countless American "relief" canned foods "relieved" more than 20 canned food industries to collapse. For the same reason, more than 50 tanneries closed down. Even the small noodle stalls on the street were squeezed out of breath by American coffee, milk, and bread.

Shanghai industrial and commercial figures pointed out that in order to achieve its goal of plundering, American imperialism used all despicable and shameless means. After Japan surrendered, American imperialism saw that Japan had plundered a large number of materials, but it repackaged these Japanese goods and used them as American goods to enter the Shanghai market. For example, it printed American brands on Japanese-made toothbrushes and sold them at half the price of domestic products; Japanese-made elastic bands were fitted with American-made heads and became American goods, which were promoted in the Shanghai market. The flood of American and Japanese goods combined to crush all the garter manufacturing factories in the city.

Instructing Chiang Kai-shek Bandits to Block the Coastline in an Attempt to Strangle Our Economy

After the liberation of Shanghai, American imperialists were not reconciled to their failure in China and attempted to strangle our economy by instructing the remnants of the Taiwan bandits to block our coastline and carry out brutal bombing of Shanghai. However, Shanghai's national industrialists and businessmen pointed out that because the American imperialist tumor parasitizing on us has been removed, we are fully capable of recovering our health. Facts have proved that under the leadership of the People's Government, we are fully capable of overcoming the difficulties brought about by the blockade and bombing, and gradually moving towards the road of independent development. After the People's Government implemented a series of measures to adjust public-private relations on May 5th of this year, the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce has been improving day by day. For example, the pharmaceutical factories, which were devastated by American goods before liberation, have now recovered to 213 factories, and each one is able to break even and be self-sufficient.

When Shanghai's national industrialists and businessmen recall the past misery in today's thriving scene, they deeply experience: "American imperialism is our deadly enemy!" They unanimously stated: "We must never let American imperialism invade us again!" The city's industrial and commercial circles have universally signed the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea covenants they have drawn up, resolutely guaranteeing to smash the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression with practical actions such as stabilizing commodity prices, not hoarding, not speculating, not evading taxes, and not avoiding taxes. The city's industrial and commercial circles will also hold a grand demonstration parade today to let American imperialism see their determination and strength.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th -- The industrial and commercial circles of Guangzhou have held gatherings in the past few days to denounce the economic aggression crimes of American imperialism that have severely devastated our national industry and commerce.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, American goods and Japanese goods invested by the United States were smuggled in large quantities from Hong Kong and Macau. According to statistics from the Kuomintang reactionary government in 1948, the American goods smuggled in through Hong Kong alone reached more than 287 million Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to more than 49.12 million US dollars. American monopoly capitalists also obtained import privileges from the Kuomintang reactionary government. There were more than 200 American importers in Guangzhou, and they all used their privileges to be exempt from all restrictions on exchange settlement and import management systems, and imported American goods in large quantities. In addition, the dumping of so-called "surplus materials" and "relief materials" that came in overwhelming numbers severely devastated Guangzhou's fragile national industry and commerce. According to estimates in August 1948, 70% to 80% of the factories in Guangzhou's main industries such as weaving, rubber, cigarettes, matches, batteries, and hardware were forced to suspend operations and close down, and a large number of workers lost their jobs. About one-third of the shops related to the above industries encountered the misfortune of closing down.

Dong Panwen, a representative of the machine cotton textile industry, said at the denunciation meeting that the large-scale dumping of American fabrics such as "atomic cloth", "Gabardine", and "Serge Canton" and so-called "surplus relief materials" military canvas caused Guangzhou's weaving industry, which had once thrived after the Japanese surrender, to plummet. Tiangong Cloth Factory, which produced large quantities of canvas, was forced to stop work after the invasion of "surplus" military canvas.

Large Quantities of Glass Products Poured In, Leaving the Tanning Industry with No Way Out

Song Shaoxiang, a representative of the tanning industry, said that after a large number of American glass belts, glass handbags, and foreign leather products poured in, Guangzhou's tanning industry was forced to its demise. Originally, there were more than 400 tanning workers in the city, but by the time of liberation, more than half of them had lost their jobs.

Zhao Baqun of Zanmei Biscuit Company said that the United States dumped "Hilo" biscuits in large quantities under the pretext of "relief". Before liberation, as many as 20,000 pounds of American biscuits were smuggled in every month, suffocating the city's mechanized biscuit industry. For example, Anleyuan Company shrank from three branches to one, and the wholesale business of Mayushan Biscuit Company was completely suspended.

Gao Yulian, a representative of the cosmetics industry, said that before American goods "patronized", everyone loved to use domestic cosmetics such as Huruidou Tooth Powder, Sanzhi Xiang Tou Wax, Guang Shen Hang Flower Dew, and Sanfeng Powder; but once American cosmetics came, we were all suppressed and couldn't raise our heads! The monthly sales of Sanzhi Xiang Tou Wax from Baijiali Factory fell from more than 100 dozens to four or five dozens, and the factory's Fei Zi Soap was completely taken over by the American-made Palmolive soap.

Xi Zhanpeng of Xinghua Battery Factory said that at the beginning of the victory against Japan, Guangzhou's battery industry had a monthly output of 210,000 dozens of batteries, but once American-made batteries such as "Yun Zhe Zi Da" and "Atom" came, domestic batteries were severely hit, resulting in a drop in production.

American Flour Flooded the Market, and Local Flour Could Not Open Up Sales Channels

Zhu Xuechun of Fuxin Flour Mill accused that before liberation, because American flour flooded the market, local flour could not open up sales channels. At that time, under the name of "relief materials", as much as 70,000 to 80,000 bags of American flour were dumped every month, and 60% to 70% of the flour market was taken over by American goods.

Cigarette manufacturers also accused the tragic situation of the industry being devastated by the large-scale dumping of American cigarettes. They pointed out that after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, Guangzhou's cigarette factories had developed to more than 120, with a monthly output of more than 20,000 boxes of cigarettes, but soon they were severely hit by the dumping of American cigarettes. At that time, more than 5,000 boxes of American cigarettes were smuggled in every month. In less than half a year, more than 90 manual cigarette factories closed down completely, and only 15 or 16 of the more than 30 cigarette factories with machinery and equipment were left, and production plummeted. The largest Daguo China Cigarette Factory plummeted from a monthly output of more than 1,000 boxes to more than 200 boxes.

    上海广州民族工商业家集会座谈            
    沉痛控诉美帝经济侵略            
    美帝曾以倾销政策严重摧残了我民族工商业，致不少厂家至今尚未离窘境。
    【新华社上海十六日电】上海市民族工商业家近日纷纷控诉解放前他们在美国经济侵略下的痛苦。他们从事实中深切地体验到：“美帝国主义是我们民族工商业的死对头！”著名工业家刘鸿生说：“我们都记得，抗日战争刚胜利，美国货就如潮水一样地倾泻到上海市场上来，摧残了我们多少幼弱的民族工商业！”
    卷烟工业联营公司负责人经叔平，一提起解放前卷烟业的情况，就显出无比的愤慨。他说：“抗战胜利以后，什么‘马立斯’、‘吉士’、‘骆驼’等牌子的美国香烟，大量涌进上海市场上来，夺去了全市卷烟销售量的十分之七。在这个沉重的打击下，全市八十多家卷烟厂就有一半以上被迫歇业。”
    大量药品缝衣机入口挤垮了工厂十分之八
    “解放前制药业的情况也很可怜！”中华制药公司总经理陈丰镐说，“仅一九四六年美国药品进口总额就达一千八百万美元，此外从冲绳岛运来的所谓“剩余药品”有三万吨。市场上充满了美国药，使全市两百多家制药工厂一下子就倒闭掉一百六十多家。”
    在美货倾销和百业不振的影响下，机器制造业的境况就更要悲惨，停闭的工厂占该业原有工厂的百分之八十。据海关统计：一九四六年一月以后的十七个月中，美制缝衣机器输入达五千多部，相当于当时全市缝衣机器工厂二年多的总生产量。同期美制锉刀输入达十万零三千五百三十打，几达当时全市锉刀制造业的十四年零四个月的可能生产量。专门生产锉刀的利中工艺社经理金梦轩悲愤地说：“直到现在，市上还有大批美国锉刀的存货，因此我们的厂还不能迅速地恢复生产。”
    利用外交特权实行公开走私
    美帝国主义者除了控制我国海关，利用低税倾销美国商品以外，还利用“盟军用品”“免税免验”的外交特权，实行公开的走私，特别是玻璃丝袜的走私最为猖獗。中国织造厂经理浦慕岐控诉说：“抗日战争胜利前，本市丝袜厂尚有二百四十多家，月产丝袜十万打左右，产销平衡。但是随着抗日胜利，美国的玻璃丝袜大量走私进来，本业受到了严重打击，纷纷倒闭，至解放前只剩下了六十八家，月产一万多打，却还销不完，这可见美帝国主义的经济侵略比日本还要毒辣。”
    以“善后救济”之名进行巧取豪夺之实
    美帝国主义者向我进行经济侵略，惯会巧立各种好听的名目，所谓“善后救济”也就是其中的一种。源生牧场经理李伯龙说：“美帝国主义大量倾销乳品还不算，还借‘帮助中国改良乳牛品种’为名，由‘善后救济总署’运来一万头美国乳牛，这批乳牛经过宋匪美龄等官僚买办之手，转眼就开起牛奶棚，把我们牛乳业挤得透不过气来。”数不清的美国“救济”罐头食物，即“救济”垮了二十多家罐头食品业。由于同样的原因，五十多家制革厂倒闭了。甚至街头面食小摊也被美国咖啡、牛奶、面包排挤得透不过气来。
    上海工商界人士指出：美帝国主义为了要达到其巧取豪夺的目的，施用了一切卑鄙无耻的手段。日本投降以后，美帝国主义看在日本掠夺了大批物资，它却把这批日货改装了一下，充作美国货打进上海市场。例如它将日制牙刷印上美国牌子，以低于国货的一半价格抛售；将日制宽紧带装上美制头子，就变成美货，在上海市场上推销，美日货汇合而成的洪流，把全市的袜带制造厂都冲垮了。
    指使蒋匪封锁海口企图窒息我国经济
    上海解放以后，美帝国主义者还不甘心它在中国的失败，企图窒息我国经济，指使台湾残余匪帮封锁我国海口，并对上海施行残酷的轰炸。但是，上海市民族工商业家指出：由于寄生在我们身上的美帝国主义毒瘤已被割除，我们是完全能够恢复健康的。事实证明：我们在人民政府的领导下，完全能够克服由封锁和轰炸所带来的困难，逐渐走向独立发展的道路。在今年五月五日人民政府施行了一系列调整公私关系的措施以后，上海市工商业的情况已日益好转。例如解放前被美货摧残得凋零不堪的制药业工厂，现在该业工厂已恢复到二百十三家，而且家家都能够保本自给。
    上海市民族工商业家在今天欣欣向荣的景象中，回忆过去的惨状时，就更深深地体验到：“美帝国主义是我们的死对头！”他们一致表示：“决不能让美帝国主义再来侵略我们！”全市工商界已普遍地在他们自己订出的抗美援朝爱国公约上签名，坚决保证以稳定物介、不囤积居奇、不投机取巧、不欠税、不逃税的实际行动来粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。全市工商界并定于今日举行一次盛大的示威游行，让美帝国主义看一看他们的决心和力量。
    【新华社广州十六日电】广州市工商界连日举行集会，控诉美帝国主义严重摧残我民族工商业的经济侵略罪行。
    抗日战争结束后，美国商品和美国投资的日货，大规模地由香港、澳门走私进口。据国民党反动政府一九四八年的统计：仅经香港走私进口的美货就达二亿八千七百余万港元，约合美金四千九百十二万余元。美国垄断资本家又在国民党反动政府手里取得了进口特权，在广州的美进口商达二百多家，他们都借特权免除一切结汇、输入管理制度等的限制，大量输入美货。此外再加上排山倒海而来的所谓“剩余物资”、“救济物资”的倾销，使基础脆弱的广州民族工商业受到严重的摧残。据一九四八年八月的估计：广州织布、橡胶、卷烟、火柴、电池、五金等主要行业的工厂，被迫停业倒闭者达百分之七十至八十，大批工人失业。与以上各业有关的商店，有三分之一左右遭遇倒闭的厄运。
    机器棉纺工业代表董泮文在控诉大会上说：美国的“原子布”、“甲巴甸”、“沙士坚”等布匹和所谓“剩余救济物资”的军用帆布大量倾销，使日本投降后曾一度欣欣向荣的广州织布业一落千丈。大量生产帆布的天工布厂，在“剩余”军用帆布入侵后就被迫停工。
    玻璃货品大批涌到制革业死路一条
    制革业代表宋绍襄说：美国玻璃裤带、玻璃手袋、洋皮革等大批涌到后，迫使广州的制革业走向死路，全市原来共有四百多个制革工人，到解放前已有半数以上失业。
    赞美饼干公司招拔群说：美帝借“救济”为名，大量倾销“希路”饼干。解放前每月走私流入的美国饼干，竟达二万磅之多，使本市机制饼干业遭到窒息。如安乐园公司由三家支号萎缩为一家，马玉山饼干公司的批发业务全部陷于停顿。
    化妆品工业代表高宇莲说：美国货未“光临”前，谁都爱用胡瑞岛牙粉、三枝香头腊、广生行花露水和三凤粉等国产化妆品；但美国化妆品一来，我们都被压迫得抬不起头来了！百家利厂的三枝香头腊从月销百余打跌到四、五打，该厂的妃子香皂被美制棕榄皂完全夺去了市场。
    兴华电池厂袭展鹏说：广州电池业在抗战胜利之初，曾月产电池二十一万打但美制的“云者自达”、“原子”等牌子的电池一来，国货电池大受打击，以至产量跌落。
    美国面粉充斥市场土面无法打开销路
    福新面粉厂朱学纯指控说：解放前由于美国面粉充斥市场，土面无法打开销路。当时在“救济物资”名义下倾销的美面月达七、八万包，百分之六十至七十的面粉市场被美国货所夺取。
    卷烟厂商也控诉了该业受美国纸烟大量倾销所摧残的惨况。他们指出：抗战结束后，广州卷烟厂已发展到一百二十余家，月产纸烟二万多箱，但不久即受到美国纸烟倾销的严重打击。当时每月偷运进口的美烟达五千多箱，不到半年，九十多家手工卷烟厂全部倒闭，三十多家有机器设备的卷烟厂也只剩下了十五、六家，产量一落千丈。规模最大的大中国烟厂，从月产千余箱惨跌到二百余箱。
