(Xinhua News Agency, December 18th) A compilation of TASS dispatches: On December 17th, Soviet voters participated in the local Soviet elections amidst a joyous festive atmosphere. In the cities and villages of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and the Karelo-Finnish Republic, voters arrived at the brilliantly decorated polling stations before the stipulated time of 6:00 AM, waiting to cast their ballots for the candidates of the Stalinist party and non-party alliance.

In Moscow, in the Stalin electoral district, where the great leader of the working people, Stalin, was a candidate, all voters had cast their ballots by noon. In Moscow's Leningrad, Dzerzhinsky, and many other electoral districts, voting was completed before 2:00 PM. From early morning, the people of Moscow received congratulatory telegrams from people all over the country.

The heroic city of Leningrad was decorated with banners and slogans, creating a scene of splendor. Within the first hour of the election's commencement, tens of thousands of citizens had fulfilled their sacred duty. In all cities and villages of Belarus, 92 percent of voters had cast their ballots by noon. In the city of Tiflis, Georgia, voters gathered early in the morning at the house where Stalin was born to vote. Voters in the new residential areas of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and other water conservancy construction areas participated in the election for the first time on the 17th. They all eagerly voted in support of the Soviet Union's communist construction cause.

In all cities and villages of the Soviet Far East, dawn arrived earliest. When the electoral districts of the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka had already completed voting, the election in Moscow was just beginning. Voters in Chita, Vladivostok, and Novosibirsk flocked to the polling stations early in the morning to vote. Collective farmers in Yakutia said: "We are voting for the Stalinist friendship of all nationalities. We are electing the great Stalin because he has brought a happy life to the remote villages of Yakutia."

Small polling stations were set up on trains and ships to facilitate voting for voters on the journey. When the train on the Vladivostok-Moscow railway line entered Kuibyshevka station, passengers conveniently voted on board at 6:00 AM local time. On the flagship of the Aleutian whaling fleet on the Soviet east coast, all sailors completed their voting in a very short time.
