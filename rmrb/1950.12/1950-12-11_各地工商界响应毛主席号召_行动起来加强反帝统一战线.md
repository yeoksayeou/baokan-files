    The Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce said in a telegram to Chairman Mao on the 3rd: After studying current affairs and accusing the United States of economic aggression, we in the industrial and commercial sectors have deeply realized the essence of American imperialist aggression. We know that to safeguard the fruits of the Chinese revolution and carry out peaceful construction, we must resolutely oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce said in a telegram to Chairman Mao on the 5th: Your reply telegram to the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin has given us incomparable excitement. We accept your instructions, unite all patriotic industrialists and businessmen in this city, jointly abide by the five patriotic covenants previously formulated, and resolutely unite with the masses of the people to form a united front that is even more consolidated than in the past against imperialist aggression, in order to achieve the final victory in the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression.

The original telegram is as follows: To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    American imperialism's frenzied aggression against Korea, treading the old path of Japanese imperialism, has caused China to feel the threat of war and has damaged peace in Asia. In order to smash the illusions of American imperialism, we are determined to unite with people from all walks of life, consolidate the anti-American and aid-Korea camp, and carry out the sacred task of defending the homeland. Through a joint meeting of responsible persons from various trade associations, five covenants have been formulated as norms of action for industry and commerce to resist American aggression and aid Korea, vowing to fight American imperialism to the end. With this telegram, we send our highest respects.

    Signature Campaign by Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Circles in Support of Patriotic Covenants Becomes a Mass Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] The signing of patriotic covenants against American aggression by industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai has become a mass movement. Since the city's industrial and commercial circles issued the five patriotic covenants on November 27, representatives from all walks of life throughout the city have signed the covenants as of the 4th of this month. The industrial and commercial circles and street vendors in the North Railway Station District formed a propaganda team of more than 270 people to promote the signing of the covenant by industrial and commercial households throughout the district, conducting propaganda and mobilization in various shops in the neighborhoods. Many shops posted the signed covenants on glass windows, and some shops solemnly affixed their shop seals on the covenants. In just half a day, the propaganda team promoted the signing of the covenant by 2,500 shops and 400 vendors. More than 70 taxpayer households in Ziziyou Lane in the Laozha District submitted a tax oath to the district's tax bureau on November 29, expressing their firm support for the patriotic covenants and promising to complete their tax payment tasks on schedule. Members of the cotton cloth and flour industry associations, in addition to signing the patriotic covenants, also signed the industry's business covenants, resolutely implementing the principles of legitimate business operations and the handling of those who violate the covenants. Industries such as eyeglasses, silk fabrics, woolens, clocks and watches, and fruits have held meetings or written to newspapers, expressing their determination to sell off existing American goods and never buy or sell American goods again.
    Shenyang's Industrial and Commercial Circles Pass Seven Patriotic Covenants, Vowing to Fully Support the Chinese People's Volunteers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th] The Shenyang Municipal Industrial and Commercial Circles held a mobilization meeting for resisting American aggression and aiding Korea to protect the homeland on December 5th, attended by more than 1,400 representatives from 83 industries. At the meeting, all representatives unanimously passed the seven patriotic covenants of the industrial and commercial circles as a program of action to participate in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea to protect the homeland. The seven patriotic covenants are: 1. Contribute all efforts to support the voluntary actions of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea to protect the homeland. 2. Actively improve business operations, implement urban-rural mutual assistance, and do a good job in supplying military and civilian materials. 3. Persist in production, strengthen labor-capital unity, and ensure the completion of processing and ordering tasks. 4. Resolutely struggle against speculators who engage in speculation and hoarding to drive up prices. 5. Implement government policies, abide by government laws and regulations, strengthen unity and mutual assistance among trades, respond to government calls, and complete all tasks assigned by the state. 6. Crush rumors and promptly report any sabotage activities by bandits and special agents. 7.

    At the meeting, representatives from various industries expressed their intention to mobilize their respective industries to warmly慰劳 the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The meeting also passed a letter of慰问 to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Qingdao Industrial and Commercial Circles Denounce U.S. Economic Aggression, Taking Practical Actions to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea to Protect the Homeland
    [Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] The Qingdao industrial and commercial circles angrily denounced the U.S. imperialist economic aggression's destruction of China's national industry and commerce, expressing their determination to resolutely take practical actions to resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect the homeland. Since the Japanese surrender, the American invaders, under the pretext of "accepting surrender" and "repatriating prisoners," forcibly occupied Qingdao. What followed was a flood of American goods that flooded the market, leading Qingdao's national industry and commerce to fall into a more rapid state of bankruptcy than during the Japanese rule. More than 300 flour mills in the city completely ceased operations. Of the 300 machinery and iron industries, very few were able to operate. The city's only "Laoshan Tobacco Company" only operated for 26 days in the four years before liberation due to the dumping of American cigarettes. Li Tengjiao of the Match Industry Association denounced the tragic situation of the American match dumping that strangled the match industry before liberation, saying: At that time, American matches were piled up everywhere in the market, forcing the Qingdao match industry to completely cease operations. We only fully resumed operations after liberation. We deeply understand that only by crushing imperialist aggression can the survival and development of national industry and commerce be guaranteed. He Guangmao, manager of Huachang Paper Mill, said angrily: After the Japanese surrender, a large amount of American paper was dumped in Qingdao, reaching more than 15,000 tons per year, even toilet paper was imported from the United States in large quantities. Of the ten paper mills in the city, six were completely closed down, and four were in a state of semi-death. Now we have all fully recovered again. We will never let American imperialism invade us again.
    In the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect the homeland, the Qingdao industrial and commercial circles formulated six patriotic covenants, and held a mobilization meeting for resisting American aggression and aiding Korea to protect the homeland on the 5th of this month. More than 2,000 representatives from various industries unanimously stated: They are willing to contribute all their strength to resolutely resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect the homeland, and strive to complete the winter business tax ahead of schedule. The movement to慰问 the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army is also underway in Qingdao's industrial and commercial circles. The total value of donated慰问 goods from the textile industry alone has reached more than 10 million yuan.
    Hangzhou Industrial and Commercial Circles Launch a No-Tax-Evasion Movement, Expressing Their Determination to Be Patriotic Through Practical Actions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th] The Hangzhou industrial and commercial circles are expressing their determination to resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect the homeland through the practical action of completing their tax payment tasks. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce has formulated six tax payment covenants, calling on all industries to complete their tax payment tasks, supervise each other, and ensure that there is no concealment, no tax evasion, and no tax arrears; the covenant also calls on all industries to clear up the more than 700 million yuan in overdue industrial and commercial taxes before the 15th. This covenant has been enthusiastically supported by industrialists and businessmen throughout the city. Members and manufacturers from the city's 75 larger industries have all signed the tax payment covenant. Industries with more tax arrears have also organized "overdue tax collection teams," guaranteeing the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the tax bureau that they will clear up the overdue taxes on schedule. In order to expand this movement, the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce has called on the federations of industry and commerce in all cities and counties in the province to launch a movement to clear up overdue taxes.

    青岛工商界控诉美国经济侵略以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国
    【新华社青岛八日电】青岛市工商界愤怒控诉美帝国主义经济侵略对我民族工商业的摧残，表示坚决以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国。自日寇投降后，美国侵略者借口“受降”、“遣俘”，曾强占青岛，接踪而来的是美货充斥了市场，青市民族工商业比日寇统治时期更加迅速地陷于破产的绝境。全市三百多家面粉业完全停工。三百家机器铁工业中能够经营者亦寥寥无几。全市仅有的一家“崂山烟草公司”，在美国烟的倾销下，解放前四年中只开了二十六天工。火柴业公会李腾蛟控诉解放前美国火柴大批倾销扼杀火柴业的惨状说：当时在市场上到处堆积着美国火柴，逼得青市火柴业全部停工。解放后我们才全部开工。我们深切地体会到，只有粉碎帝国主义的侵略，民族工商业的生存和发展才能获得保证。华昌造纸厂经理何光茂愤怒地说：日寇投降后，美国纸在青岛大量倾销，每年达一万五千吨以上，连手纸也大批从美国运进来。全市十家造纸厂中，有六家完全倒闭，四家处在半死的状态。现在我们又重新全部恢复起来了。我们决不让美帝国主义再来侵略。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，青岛市工商界制定了六项爱国公约，本月五日又举行了抗美援朝保家卫国动员大会，各行业到会代表两千多人一致表示：愿供献一切力量，坚决抗美援朝保家卫国，并争取提前完成冬季营业税。全市工商业界慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的运动亦正在开展，仅纺织业自愿捐献慰劳品总值即达一千万元以上。
