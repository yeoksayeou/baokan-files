Vice Premier Kim Chaek delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have now liberated almost all of the northern regions of the Republic that were temporarily occupied by the enemy, and are now continuing to pursue and annihilate the enemy to the south.

Behind you, supporting you, are hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, especially the 475 million Chinese people in your close neighborhood. We Chinese people are determined to support you with all our strength. He pointed out: Since the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have been fighting side by side for two months, they have annihilated a large number of enemies, driven the enemy back more than 400 miles, and now our army is still advancing.
