According to Tianjin Daily news: Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, factories in Tianjin, both public and private, have found that those that did a good job of current affairs propaganda and education also saw successful production emulation, continuous increases in production, and high morale among workers. However, some factories did not conduct current affairs propaganda and education effectively, and the production emulation movement was not closely integrated with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, or was poorly integrated. As a result, the production emulation was not vigorous, and some factories even fell into a state of laissez-faire.

Workers at the Tianjin State-owned Cotton Mill put forward the slogan in the emulation: "Eliminating waste cloth is eliminating Truman; letting go of a 'big knot' is like letting go of an American devil." Workers in the steel rolling department of the No. 1 Steel Plant exceeded the previous highest record by 7 percent on November 8, while the quality improved by 20 percent compared to late October. The No. 4 Branch of the Dyeing and Finishing Factory increased the output of printed fabric base from 34 yards per loom per eight hours to 38 yards. The workers in these factories clearly understood the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea and of the production emulation and that is why the production emulation movement unfolded. The state-owned Automotive Transportation Company used to have a quota of 1,200 kilometers per vehicle per month, but after the launch of the patriotic production emulation, it has been raised to 2,000 to 2,700 kilometers.

However, in the process of patriotic production emulation, the following shortcomings have also emerged, which urgently need to be improved: One is that the propaganda and education of resisting America and aiding Korea had just begun, and the staff and workers did not have a full understanding. Leading cadres prematurely put forward the slogan of launching patriotic production emulation, failing to form a mass-based conscious movement (in fact, the leading cadres themselves did not seriously make preparations and plans for the emulation based on the actual conditions and needs of their factories). In some factories, the leading cadres only announced it at the Resist America, Aid Korea mobilization meeting and then "changed" the ongoing regular emulation into a patriotic emulation. Because they did not widely carry out ideological education against American imperialism's aggression, and did not deeply promote the movement of hating, despising, and scorning American aggressors, the enthusiasm of the workers was not fully mobilized. There was no emulation plan administratively, so there was no new improvement or increase in the production situation after the emulation. Another is that the enthusiasm of the workers has already boiled over, and they have actively requested to launch a patriotic production emulation, or it has already been automatically launched in individual workshops. However, because the leading cadres (mainly the trade union) failed to actively organize and lead it, the emulation fell into a state of laissez-faire. Third, many employees still have more or less a purely task-oriented view in the emulation. Some model workers at Tianjin Station have created great achievements in their work, but they do not understand the relationship between production emulation and resisting America and aiding Korea. Many units' employees only put forward a pile of guarantee conditions, but lack specific methods to achieve the conditions, resulting in the guarantees being impossible to achieve, such as some locomotives proposing to guarantee no liability accidents, but accidents are still frequent. Individual factories have even proposed simple and rigid methods of increasing labor intensity and extending working hours, which are harmful to workers' health. The reason for the above shortcomings is mainly that they did not regard the Resist America, Aid Korea and defend the homeland movement as a long-term patriotic movement, but as a temporary and sudden task. Therefore, they failed to carry out in-depth ideological education against American aggression and, on this basis, correctly guide the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses into production.

    津部分工厂经验证明
    对工人进行时事教育  是搞好生产竞赛关键
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：天津各公私营工厂自抗美援朝运动展开以来，时事宣传教育作得好的，生产竞赛就进行得好，生产不断提高，工人情绪高涨。但部分工厂对时事宣传教育没有很好进行，生产竞赛运动没有和抗美援朝运动紧密结合或结合得不好，所以生产竞赛就搞得不起劲，部分工厂甚至陷于自流状态。
    津市国营棉纺厂的工人，竞赛中提出“消灭残布就是消灭杜鲁门，放过一个‘大接头’就等于放过了一个美国鬼子”的口号。钢铁一分厂轧钢部工人，十一月八日的产量超过以往最高纪录的百分之七，而质量比十月下旬提高百分之二十。染整厂四分厂织印花底子布，由过去八小时每台布机产三十四码，增至三十八码。上面这些工厂的工人，因为把抗美援朝和生产竞赛的重大意义弄清楚了，所以生产竞赛运动展开了。国营汽车运输公司过去每辆车每月定额为一千二百公里，爱国生产竞赛展开后，亦已提高到二千至二千七百公里。
    但在爱国主义生产竞赛过程中，也产生了以下几种缺点，急需改进：一种是抗美援朝的宣传教育刚刚开始，职工尚无充分认识，领导干部便过早的提出开展爱国生产竞赛的口号，未能形成群众性的自觉的运动（实际上，领导干部本身也未认真根据本厂情况与需要，做出竞赛的准备与计划）。有的工厂，领导干部只在抗美援朝动员大会上宣布一下，便将正在进行着的经常性的竞赛“改变”成了爱国竞赛；因为没有广泛的开展反对美帝侵略的思想教育，没有深入的推广仇视、鄙视、蔑视美国侵略者的运动，工人群众的热情没有充分发挥起来。行政上也没有竞赛计划，所以，竞赛后的生产情况没有什么新的改善或提高。另一种是工人群众的热情已经沸腾起来，主动要求开展爱国生产竞赛，或是已经自动的在个别车间开展起来，但由于领导干部（主要是工会）未能主动予以组织和领导，致使竞赛陷于自流状态。第三、不少职工在竞赛中或多或少的还存在单纯任务观点。天津站有的劳模在工作上创造了很大的成绩，但弄不清生产竞赛与抗美援朝的关系。不少单位职工，只提出了一堆保证条件，但缺乏具体实现条件的办法，结果保证无法实现，如有的机车提出保证不出责任事故，但还是事故累累。个别工厂且提出单纯的生硬的提高劳动强度，延长劳动时间的办法，致有害工人健康。产生上述缺点的原因，主要是没有把抗美援朝保家卫国运动，看作是一个长期性的爱国运动。而认为是一种临时的突击性的任务。因此，便未能深入的开展反美侵略的思想教育，并在此基础上，把群众的爱国热情正确的引导到生产中去。
