Why have accidents been occurring frequently at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot recently?

From August 5th to November 3rd, the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot maintained over 80 days without accidents; the accumulated mileage reached more than 280,000 safe kilometers. However, since November 4th, nine accidents have occurred consecutively in 22 days. After the "MK1" No. 1503 locomotive ran past a signal on the 4th, there were four more accidents involving derailments, collisions with horse-drawn carts, and deaths and injuries; on the 19th, "MK1" No. 1712 also ran past a signal; as of the 25th, three consecutive locomotive damage accidents had occurred.

This series of accidents has caused huge losses to state property. Taking the "MK1" No. 1712 locomotive accident as an example, the loss from wear and tear alone is estimated to be over 18.1 billion yuan.

The main reasons for these accidents are the negligence or complacency of the crew, leading to violations of regulations. For example, in the "MK1" No. 1503 running past a signal accident, the co-driver, while driving into the station, violated traffic regulations by exceeding the speed limit by 25 kilometers in order to gain technical speed and save coal. Before braking, he was complacent and negligent, and when he braked about 20 meters from the departure signal, the braking effect was slow because the pressure was not sufficient and the speed was too high, resulting in running past the departure signal.

Secondly, the reward system is unreasonable—coal saving rewards are higher than safety and all other rewards. As a result, the crew only pays attention to saving coal and does not pay enough attention to safety. For example, some crew members said: "Even if there is an accident, there is still a large coal saving bonus!" Many crew members carefully calculate coal saving, only strive for technical speed, and ignore speed limits.

Based on the lessons of these accidents, I suggest that the depot and bureau conduct a rapid inspection and correction to reduce and avoid the occurrence of accidents.

### 张家口机务段近来为什么接连发生事故？

    张家口机务段近来为什么接连发生事故？编辑同志：
    张家口机务段从八月五日到十一月三日，全段保持了八十余日无事故；累计公里成绩达到了二十八万多安全公里。但是，从十一月四日以来，二十二天中连续发生九件事故。四日“冖ㄎ一”一五○三号机车冒进信号后，又接连发生了挤岔子、撞马车、死伤等事故四件；十九日，“冖ㄎ一”一七一二号又出了冒进信号事故；到二十五日为止，又造成了连续三次机车破损事故。
    这一连串的事故，造成了国家财产巨大的损失。即以“冖ㄎ一”一七一二机车事故的损失大概计算，只磨损率的损失即达一八一亿余元。
    造成这些事故的原因，主要是乘务员等的疏忽大意或自满骄傲而违犯规章形成的。例如“冖ㄎ一”一五○三号冒进信号事故，副司机驾驶进站时为了争取技术速度、节煤成绩，违犯了行车制度，超越规定二十五公里速度。制动前骄傲疏忽，结果距出发信号二十余米制动时，因压力已不够充足和速度快，制动效果缓慢，结果冒进了出发。
    其次，是奖励制度的不合理——节煤奖励高于安全及其他一切奖励。因此，使乘务员只注意节煤，而对安全不够重视。如有的乘务员说：“出了事故仍有大宗的节煤奖呢！”很多乘务员都精打细算的节煤，只争取技术速度，忽视了速度限制。
    根据这些事故的教训，我建议段方及局方迅速进行检查、纠正，以减少和避免事故的发生。
