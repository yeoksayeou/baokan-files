Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: A comprehensive report from TASS: The Soviet Union will hold elections for local Soviets in various border regions, states, districts, cities, and rural areas on the 17th. Preparations for the elections are proceeding enthusiastically.

In October, after the election regulations were announced, tens of thousands of election propagandists from mass organizations in various regions immediately began work, explaining the election regulations, the Stalin Constitution, and the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy to voters, and widely organizing discussions. In many places, the election propagandists are prominent Stakhanovite workers, scientists, teachers, writers, and artists. For example, Academician Paratin, President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, personally participated in the propaganda work. During the election propaganda period, the issues of greatest concern to Soviet voters were the Korean War, the world peace movement, and the struggle against American aggression.

In mid-November, the election preparations entered a new stage. Working people in various regions held nomination meetings for candidates to the Soviet deputies, and they all nominated Stalin as the first candidate. Foreman Drobasa of the Kharkov Molotov Machine Tool Factory said at the meeting: "Today, no one's name is more cherished than Stalin's. Stalin is peace, is victory, is the happiness of all peoples." People's gatherings in various regions also unanimously nominated Stalin's close comrades-in-arms Molotov, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Beria, Malenkov, Mikoyan, and others as candidates. This fully demonstrates the Soviet people's infinite love and loyalty to the Party and government that leads them in building communism. Many of the best representatives of the working people have also been nominated as candidates, including famous workers, farmers, scientists, artists, engineers, and so on.

Currently, campaign activities have begun in various regions. The election committees in various regions are registering the candidates who have agreed to participate in the election. The working people in various regions have elected a large number of representatives to study the candidates' lives and social activities, and then report to the voters. In propaganda stations established in all large lecture halls, clubs, and rural reading rooms, candidates are warmly meeting with voters. At the same time, workers in various factories are stepping up Stakhanovite work, and collective farmers are guaranteeing to greet the election with new labor achievements.
