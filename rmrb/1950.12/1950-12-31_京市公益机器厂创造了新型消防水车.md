    "Quick, write a letter to Chairman Mao, report on the success of our new rotary gear fire engine!" On December 26, 1950, the workers of the Beijing Public Welfare Machine Factory, crowded into a room, were excitedly discussing how to write a letter to Chairman Mao to report their recent creation—the "pump" fire engine. About thirty minutes later, the factory director had already written the letter to Chairman Mao. He read to the workers: "In order to ensure the fire safety of the capital, all the employees of our factory worked together and overcame various difficulties, and finally manufactured a rotary gear pump fire engine. It can carry six tons of water and shoot more than ten zhang high. Its effectiveness not only equals but exceeds that of fire engines bought from foreign countries. From now on, we are free from the restrictions of imperialism and can manufacture fire engines ourselves. This success is entirely due to your great and wise leadership, which inspired the workers' initiative and consciousness. We hereby report to you."
    The workers cheered and applauded. In the enthusiastic cheers and applause, not only was a strong guarantee provided for the safety of the lives and property of the two million citizens of Beijing, but also, with the success of the self-made new fire engine, the restrictions of imperialism were eliminated, which is a great contribution to the national fire protection work.
    The reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government left Beijing with more than a dozen dilapidated fire engines, which have been used in a makeshift manner for more than a year. Although the task has been basically completed, it is not a fundamental solution. This spring, a batch of Japanese fire engines had to be purchased, but "must we always rely on imperialism?" Comrade Yi Bosheng, political commissar of the Fire Brigade of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, was constantly thinking about this question. This summer, the higher authorities called for strengthening winter fire prevention and enriching fire protection equipment. Adding fire engines was certainly a necessary task. Should we buy them from foreign countries? Not only are there various difficulties in purchasing and transportation, but also funds will flow out. There is no fire engine factory in China that can manufacture usable fire engines. If "we don't do it, we will never do it, and we will never get rid of the shackles of imperialism." Having made up his mind, he went to consult with the Public Welfare Machine Factory: "If you can do it, you will lay a foundation for China's fire protection equipment industry, so that we will not have to buy from foreign countries again."
    The Public Welfare Machine Factory is a small factory engaged in government production, which was established only in July last year. With the hard work of all employees, now not only has the machinery been increased and the workshops built, but also the number of employees has increased twentyfold. After accepting the task of manufacturing fire engines in July this year, the factory director, engineers, and workers discussed together how to complete this task. Although the workers were not very familiar with the work of manufacturing fire engines, they believed that under the leadership of the Party, all difficulties could be overcome, so they first made a guarantee: "As long as it is drawn, we can make it." The engineers also expressed great confidence and made a guarantee. It was agreed that the first fire engine would be delivered on October 1st. Seeing that the time was approaching, the design, procurement, and other work had not been fully completed, and the workers were quite anxious. At this time, it was also when U.S. imperialism was frantically invading Korea, and the whole country was swept up in the great wave of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The workers responded to the call to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical actions to strive for the early success and delivery of the fire engine. This time, the enthusiasm really came up. The difficulties in front of the workers were also overwhelmed. If there were not enough electric drills, the work was not allowed to stop. If electric drills could not be used, manual drills were used. Worker Zhang Zhencheng did other work during the day, and took advantage of the machine's free time at night to rush to punch holes. Liu Zhendong, an old fitter in his fifties, lay on the bottom of the car all day long, punching holes upwards; others worried that he was too tired, but he kept insisting on working. When worker Zhang Baolin was repairing a leaky car, he climbed under the car to repair it, saying, "In the past, the Kuomintang laid a mat, and I wouldn't crawl under it." When worker Fu Weizhong and others were installing a ton of water tanks, they were almost crushed. He said indifferently, "It doesn't matter if I die, just do it!" Drafter Sun Wei also worked with the workers and personally started working, guarding the machine all day long covered in mud. Some workers were also moved by this. After more than two months of hard work by all employees, the fire engine was finally successful. The first time the water was tested, the range was five or six zhang. Everyone was not satisfied with this result. After careful research by the engineers and workers, the belt was widened and the groove wheel was enlarged. The second time the water was tested, the range exceeded ten zhang.
    At present, although the range of the fire engine has not significantly exceeded the performance of Japanese fire engines, it has characteristics that Japanese fire engines do not have: First, the car has a water tank that can hold six tons of water, and it can discharge water immediately to rescue the fire scene. Small fires can be guaranteed to be extinguished, and there is plenty of time to transport water sources in the event of a major fire. Second, the mechanism is simple and solid. The rotary gear pump has only nineteen parts, and they can all be manufactured in China, and they are easy to repair and replace. The water pump of the Japanese car has more than two hundred parts, which are prone to problems and are not easy to repair. The Fire Brigade of the Beijing Public Security Bureau has fully confirmed its characteristics and effectiveness in more than a month of use. On December 1st, a fire broke out at Xisi Pailou, and the car kept shooting water for more than ten hours without any malfunction. Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Directors Feng Jiping and Zhang Minghe wrote letters of encouragement to all employees of the Public Welfare Machine Factory on December 14th. The letter said: "You have demonstrated a high degree of work tenacity and labor enthusiasm, overcome numerous difficulties, and achieved the creation of the public welfare fire engine in your work. Not only does it increase the guarantee for the people's fire protection cause, but it also gets rid of the restrictions of the imperialists on us from now on. I hope you will maintain this spirit of hard work and creation, and continue to carry it forward!"
    Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can the working masses develop their wisdom, initiative, and creativity. As long as the working class actively strives and creates, it is entirely possible to overcome the restrictions and difficulties imposed on us by imperialism.

    京市公益机器厂创造了新型消防水车
    “快给毛主席写封信，报告报告咱们新作的回转式牙轮消防水车的成功！”一九五○年十二月二十六日，京市公益机器厂的工人，挤在一间屋子里，正兴高彩烈地商量着怎样写信向毛主席报告他们最近的创作——“帮浦”消防水车。大约在三十分钟以后，厂长已经写好了给毛主席的信。他向工人们念着：为了保证首都的防火安全，我厂全体职工集体努力，克服种种困难，终于制成了回转式牙轮水泵消防水车，它能载六吨水，射十丈多高，效力不仅比得过而超过从外国买来的水车，从此我们摆脱了帝国主义对我们的限制，能够自己制造水车了。这完全是由于您伟大英明的领导，启发了工人的自觉自动才获致成功的。我们特向您报告。”
    工人们欢呼着，鼓着掌。在热烈的欢呼和掌声里，不仅给北京二百万市民生命财产的安全，提供了有力的保证，而且自造的新水车成功后，就从此摆脱了帝国主义的限制，对全国消防工作是一个很大的贡献。
    反动的蒋介石政府，留给北京十多辆破烂不堪的消防车，一年多来也只有凑合使用，基本上虽然完成了任务，毕竟不是根本解决问题的办法。今年春天，不得不买了一批日本水车，可是“我们就得永远依靠帝国主义吗？”京市公安局消防大队政委伊渤生同志，经常地在思考着这个问题。今年夏季上级号召准备加强冬季防火，充实消防设备，添制消防水车当然是很必要的工作，到外国去买吗？不但购买、运输上有种种困难，而且还要资金外流。国内又没有制造能顶得上使的消防水车厂。如果“老不作，就永远不会作，也就永远摆不脱帝国主义的羁绊。”打定了主意，就去和公益机器厂商量：“你们要能作就给我国制造防火器材工业，打下个基础，免得再向外国去买。”
    公益机器厂是搞机关生产的一个小型工厂，去年七月间才开始设立。在全体职工的艰苦奋斗下，现在不仅增添了机器，盖上了工房，而且职工也已增加了二十倍。今年七月接受了制造消防水车的任务以后，厂长、工程师和工人们一块合计，如何来完成这个任务，虽然工人对于制造消防水车的工作不顶熟悉，但他们相信在党的领导下，一切困难都是可以克服的，所以首先提出保证说：“只要画出来，咱们就能造出来。”工程师也表示很有信心地提出了保证。约定第一部水车是十月一日交货，眼看时间就快到了，设计、采购等工作还没有全弄好，工人们都相当着急。这时候，也正是美帝在猖狂地侵略着朝鲜，全国席卷在抗美援朝的伟大浪涛中，工人们以争取水车早日成功出厂的实际行动来响应抗美援朝的号召。这回热劲真是上来啦。横在工人面前的困难，也都望风披靡，电钻不够使，也不让工作停顿，使不上电钻就用人工钻。工人张振成白天干别的活，晚间趁机器空赶着打眼。五十多岁的老钳工刘振东成天躺在车底往上打眼；别人耽心他太累了，他却一直坚持着工作。工人张宝林在修理车漏水时，他一边爬在车下修理，一边说：“过去国民党铺上席子，我也不给爬。”工人傅维忠等在装一吨重的水罐时，几乎被砸住了，他满不在乎地说：“死不了没有关系，干！”绘图员孙为也和工人一起亲自动手，成天守着机器满身是泥，有些工人也因此受到了感动。全体职工两个多月的努力，水车终于成功了。第一次试验射水时，就有五六丈的射程。大家并不满意这样的成绩，又经过工程师和工人们的精心研究，把皮带加宽，槽轮加大后，第二次试水时，即突破了十丈高的射程。
    目前水车在射程上，虽然没有显著超过日本式水车的效能，但却具有为日本式水车所不及的特点：第一，车上有可容六吨水的水箱，到火警现场即时可出水施救，小火灾可以保证扑灭，遇大火灾时也有充裕的时间去接运水源。第二，机关简单牢实，回转式牙轮水泵，只有十九个零件，同时是我国都可以制造的，易修易换。日本式车的水泵上有两百多个零件，容易出毛病，不容易修理。京市公安局消防大队在一个多月来的使用中，充分证实了它的特点与效能。十二月一日，西安门发生火灾，该车一直射水十多个钟头，未发生任何故障。京市公安局局长罗瑞卿，副局长冯基平、张明河为此于十二月十四日给公益机器厂全体职工写信和鼓励。信中说：“你们发挥了高度的工作韧性和劳动积极性，突破重重困难，获得公益式消防水车这一工作中的创造。不仅为人民的消防事业增加保证，而且从此摆脱帝国主义者对我们的限制。希望你们保持这种艰苦的创造精神，并继续发扬！”
    只有在毛主席、共产党的领导下，工人群众才会发扬自己的智慧和积极性、创造性。只要在工人阶级的积极努力创造下，是完全可以战胜帝国主义给我们的限制和困难的。
