　　Contradictions Within the Imperialist Camp Deepen
　　Former British Foreign Office Official Accuses US Policy

Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Former head of the Far Eastern Department of the British Foreign Office, Butler, publicly criticized the United States' Far East policy on the 23rd. This is a notable example of the mutual recriminations within the imperialist camp resulting from the disastrous defeat in Korea. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 23rd, Butler said that the United States and the United Nations' refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China and the sending of the Seventh Fleet to occupy Taiwan were both "regrettable policies." He said, "These are violations of international friendship and acts of aggression against China." He accused the United States of having decided to renege on the promise made when signing the Cairo Declaration in 1943 that Taiwan should be returned to China. He said, "This explains why they are now insisting and forcing the United Nations to insist that Chiang Kai-shek and his gang in Taiwan are the government of China." He complained, "Because of America's China policy, the hope for a better future for the world is disappearing." Butler said he "loves America the most," while also saying, "All those who believe in truth and justice in the dealings of one nation with another are condemning America's attitude towards China. Now, the undercurrents of discontent in Britain and on the European continent against American policy are continuing to increase." Europeans "are unwilling to follow the shameful path that American policy is following." "The greatest danger lies in the fact that in Parliament and in public opinion, there is increasing pressure for Britain to break away from many aspects of American policy."

    侵朝战争惨败后
    帝国主义阵营矛盾益深
    英前外交部官员指责美国政策
    【新华社二十六日讯】英国外交部前远东司司长白特勒二十三日公开指责美国的远东政策，这是因在朝鲜的惨败而产生的帝国主义阵营内互相攻讦的显著例子之一。据合众社伦敦二十三日电，白特勒说：美国与联合国之拒绝承认中华人民共和国并派第七舰队占领台湾都是“令人遗憾的政策”。他说：“这些都是违反国际友谊和对中国的侵略行为。”他指责美国已决定抵赖一九四三年签订开罗宣言时所作的诺言，即台湾应归还中国。他说：“这说明为什么他们现在硬说并且逼迫联合国硬说在台湾的蒋介石和他的一帮人是中国的政府。”他抱怨说：“由于美国的对华政策，世界有较好前途的希望正在消失中。”白特勒说他“最喜爱美国”，同时他又说：“凡是在一国与另一国的交往上相信真理与正义的人们都在谴责美国对中国的态度。现在英国与在欧洲大陆上反对美国政策的不满的暗流，正在继续增加。”欧洲人“不愿跟着美国政策正在遵循的耻辱的道路向前走”。“最大的危险在于下列事实，即在议会以及舆论界，已有日益增大的压力要英国从美国政策的许多方面摆脱出来。”
