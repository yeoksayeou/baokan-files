    Chahar Province Completes Autumn Grain Collection Task by the End of Last Month
    [This newspaper reported] The autumn grain collection task in Chahar Province was completely fulfilled by the end of last month. During the collection process, farmers put forward the slogan "Don't forget the root after being liberated, pay patriotic grain quickly," and many moving deeds emerged. Tong Youhua from Shabyao Village, Shangyi County, is a 77-year-old man who usually does not participate in heavy labor, but this time he insisted on delivering the patriotic grain himself. As a result, he carried seventy catties of public grain to the granary in person. The farmers of Yanggao and Zuoyun counties, who achieved good results in the autumn grain collection last year, maintained their high honor this year. At the autumn grain collection meetings in the two counties, district and village cadres, and people's representatives challenged each other on behalf of their districts and villages, proposing competition conditions. The farmers enthusiastically supported them. For example, Chengguan District of Yanggao County originally proposed to complete the task in seven days, but actually paid it all in two days. In the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, villages with relatively poor working foundations in the past have also caught up. In Shapo Village, Lingqiu County, the arrears of public grain last year were dragged on until this autumn. But before the autumn grain collection this year, the farmers of the village prepared the new and old public grain properly, just waiting for the collection to begin. Smokers Ding Shichang and Zhao Youcheng, who live in Xutuan Village, Datong County, had consistently failed to pay public grain in the past, but this year they paid it all. They said, "Since our liberation, we have not done a single good deed, and we are really sorry to the government and the Communist Party. This time, in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, we must pay public grain."

    察哈尔秋征任务上月底全部完成
    【本报讯】察省秋征任务已于上月底全部完成。在征收中，农民提出了“翻身不忘本，快缴爱国粮”的口号，出现了不少可歌可颂的事情。尚义县沙卜窑村童有花，今年是七十七岁的老人，平日已不参加过重劳动了，但在此次缴纳爱国粮中，他非自己去缴不可。结果他背着七十斤公粮亲自送到粮库。去年秋征时曾获得良好成绩的阳高、左云两县农民，今年同样保持了崇高的荣誉。两县秋征会议上，区、村干部、人民代表都代表本区、本村互相挑战，提出了竞赛条件。农民热烈支持了他们。如阳高县城关区原提出七天完成任务，实际上两天便全部缴齐。在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动中，过去工作基础比较差的村子也赶了上来。灵邱县沙坡村，去年公粮尾欠曾拖到今年秋天。但在今年秋征前，该村农民把新、旧公粮一齐准备妥当，单等开征。烟民丁世昌、赵有成等人，住在大同县徐疃村，过去一贯不缴公粮，今年却全部缴上了。他们说：“咱们自从翻身后，一点好事没做过，实在对不起政府、对不起共产党，这次抗美援朝，怎么也得缴公粮。”
