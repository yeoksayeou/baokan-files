Xinhua News Agency, December 21st:

The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began in New York on September 19th, was hastily decided by the plenary session on the 15th of this month, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, to adjourn indefinitely, leaving it to the discretion of the President of the General Assembly to convene it at any time. After the adjournment of the General Assembly, only the Political Committee of the General Assembly continued to work, but this committee also decided to adjourn indefinitely at the meeting on the 18th under the manipulation of the US-British bloc. The decision of American imperialism to adopt such rogue tactics is due to its attempt to evade the anti-American aggression proposals pending review on the agenda, and also because it cannot find a way out for its own aggressive proposals pending review on the agenda. The shelved proposals include: the Soviet Union's "Accusation of US Aggression Against China" case and "Accusation of US Violation of Chinese Airspace, Strafing and Bombing of Chinese Territory, and Shelling of Chinese Ships" case, the US-British bloc's so-called slander case of "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Interfering in Korea", and the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and let the Korean people solve the Korean issue themselves in order to oppose this slander case, as well as the US's own so-called "Formosa issue" case. The action of US imperialism in manipulating the majority vote to make the UN General Assembly adjourn indefinitely proves its complete political and moral failure, and also demonstrates the fragility of US imperialism under the just accusations and powerful rebuttals of the representatives of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.

    企图逃避苏联和我国的正义控告
    美帝操纵联大无定期休会
    证明其侵略政策全归破产
    【新华社二十一日讯】九月十九日起在纽约举行的联合国第五届大会，已在本月十五日的全体会议上，在美英集团操纵之下，匆匆地决定无定期休会，听由大会主席随时召集。大会休会后仅大会政治委员会继续工作，但这个委员会亦在十八日的会议上在美英集团操纵下，决定无定期休会。美国帝国主义之决定采取这种无赖手段是由于企图逃避议程上尚待审议的反对美国侵略的议案，同时也由于无法为议程上尚待审议的、它自己提出的侵略性议案寻找出路。被搁置的提案中包括：苏联提出的“控诉美国侵略中国”案和“控诉美国侵犯中国领空、扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只”案，美英集团提出的所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案，以及苏联在为反对这个诽谤案而提出的一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜、让朝鲜人自己解决朝鲜问题的提案，以及美国自己提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”案。美国帝国主义操纵多数票使联大无定期休会的行动证明了它在政治上和道义上的完全失败，也表明了在苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家代表的正义控告和有力驳斥下美帝国主义的脆弱性。
