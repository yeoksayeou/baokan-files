    The Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has actively rectified its business, reviewed its work, made achievements, gained experience, and created a set of feasible methods since the National Cooperative Workers Conference. This is very gratifying and worthy of study and reference by cooperative workers throughout the country.
    The cooperatives in Beijing, like those in other places, once had capitalist ideas. Its main manifestation was that it did not try to serve its members in every possible way, but diligently pursued profits. Under the control of this erroneous idea, the cooperatives and their cadres often tried to "serve and make money at the same time"; or "make money first, then serve"; or "preserve capital in kind, rely on our own efforts." They even believed that the economic accounting of cooperatives was for the purpose of making more money, not for enabling members to obtain cheaper goods. Therefore, they emphasized trading with non-members, emphasized supplying and marketing profitable goods, and emphasized the preferential treatment of state-owned enterprises to cooperatives, instead of actively organizing the strength of their own members and strengthening cost accounting to serve their members. This erroneous thinking and practice has caused the cooperative work to take many detours.
    After the National Cooperative Workers Conference was held, the Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in conjunction with the rectification movement, conducted a study of the policies and business of the cooperative, reviewed its work, criticized the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, and emphasized that the cooperative must serve its members and do everything possible to meet the needs of its members and enable them to obtain cheaper goods. Experience has proved that the rectification of cooperative work should start from the business and take various effective measures.
    In order to enable the cooperatives to effectively serve their members, the first thing to do is to streamline the business and concentrate funds. The Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative took the approach of abolishing retail sales in stores and wholesale in the market, thus saving 65 cadres to strengthen procurement, transportation, and economic accounting. The goods they supplied and marketed were reduced from the original 1,031 kinds to 700 kinds, and will soon be reduced by another 200 kinds, in order to concentrate limited funds on the supply and marketing of members' main necessities. After this change, the transaction volume for non-members decreased from 24 percent in July to 4.3 percent in October. Moreover, this part mainly deals with old stocks of slow-moving goods and partial supplies to organs and troops. It is precisely because of the effort to solve the needs of the members that the total sales volume has greatly increased, with its value increasing from 11.8 billion yuan in July to 15.3 billion yuan in October, an increase of 28.4 percent. This shows the great significance of streamlining business and concentrating funds.
    According to the needs of the members, actively and systematically implementing the distribution of necessities with fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and fixed price (relatively cheap), and purchasing agricultural and sideline products from farmer members should become the basic policy of cooperative business operations. The Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has focused on investigating the purchasing power of members and the types and quantities of goods required by members, formulating business operation plans, and then carrying out procurement and distribution according to the plans. In this way, the members were satisfied, the goods sold well, and the capital turnover was accelerated. Under this business operation policy, it is most welcomed and supported by members to distribute several main commodities to members through grassroots cooperatives.
    However, in order for members to satisfactorily obtain cheap necessities, cooperatives must purchase from the place of origin, directly order from factories and mines, process themselves, calculate carefully, and strive to reduce costs. Direct procurement of goods from the place of origin and producers can avoid or reduce intermediate exploitation, enabling members to obtain cheaper goods. The obvious example is that the rice, fresh fruit, salt and other commodities purchased by the Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative from the place of origin and sold to members are 15 to 25 percent cheaper than the market price. However, if cooperatives in various places want to purchase goods from other regions, the higher authorities should organize them in advance and purchase them according to the regulations of the National Cooperation General Office, in order to avoid confusion and panic buying. This is very important. Direct ordering from factories and mines has the same effect. For example, signing supply contracts with factories and mines under state-owned enterprise companies can guarantee the source of goods and their low price and good quality. The role of self-processing by cooperatives is also the same. Because all goods processed by themselves can be much cheaper than the wholesale price on the market. As long as the cooperative general office in a region has a specific sales plan, then it will be in a position to obtain great convenience in transportation. The goods can be directly picked up by the grassroots cooperatives when they arrive at the station, which greatly saves transportation costs, warehouse costs, and unnecessary losses. The experience of the Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has fully proved that by implementing these measures, carefully calculating, and with the support of the state-owned economy, the several main commodities sold by cooperatives to members can be much cheaper than the market price, and the business of the cooperatives will be supported by the majority of members and will flourish.
    Correctly grasping the price policy is also a key issue in the cooperative business. The principle of cooperative price calculation is the original price plus freight, interest, damage, packaging, depreciation, stamp duty, plus a profit of no more than 2 percent. This is its wholesale price to the grassroots cooperatives. The Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has achieved remarkable results in implementing this price policy. For orders placed in factories in Beijing, all grassroots cooperatives go directly to pick them up without adding profit or only adding very low interest. It stipulates that the gross profit of grassroots cooperatives shall not exceed 7 percent. For goods wholesaled by the general office, all grassroots cooperatives must sell at the price stipulated by the general office, and shall not raise or lower the price. This prevents the profit-seeking mentality of individual cooperatives regardless of the interests of the members, and also guarantees legitimate and reasonable profits.
    After taking the above measures and earnestly rectifying the cooperative business, so that the members have obtained practical benefits, the members immediately feel the benefits of joining the cooperative. The members are concerned about the cooperative, and they will have more requirements for the cooperative. Even if individual members still have incorrect criticisms or requirements for the cooperative, they will immediately be refuted by other members. Under this circumstance, as long as the leadership firmly grasps the democratic movement within the community, convenes the board of directors, the representatives meeting or the members' meeting, reviews the business policy and the work style of the cadres, and formulates various systems, the cooperative will be further consolidated. It is precisely because the Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has done this that the members who originally wanted to withdraw their shares no longer withdraw; those who have withdrawn have returned to ask to join again; "honorary members" who joined without paying money have also taken the initiative to pay off their shares; and non-members are also actively asking to join. In the suburbs of Beijing, the cooperatives increased by 6.1 percent in members and 5.4 percent in shares in the ten days of late October. Cooperatives in various places should pay attention to these experiences, strive to implement the spirit of the National Cooperative Conference, actively rectify their own business, grasp the correct policy, and run the cooperatives well.

### 办好合作社

    办好合作社
    北京市供销合作总社在全国合作社工作者会议以后，积极整顿业务，检查工作，已经作出了成绩，取得了经验，创造了一套可行的办法。这是十分可喜的，值得全国各地合作社工作者的学习与参考。
    北京市的合作社也和各地合作社一样，曾经有过资本主义思想。它的主要表现，就在于不想尽办法为社员服务，而兢兢业业地追逐利润。在这种错误思想支配之下的合作社及其干部，往往企图“一面服务，一面赚钱”；或者“先赚钱，后服务”；或者是“实物保本，自力更生”。他们甚至于认为合作社要实行经济核算，就是为了多赚钱，不是为了使社员获得更廉价的商品。因此，他们强调应向非社员进行交易，强调供销有利可图的商品，强调国营企业对合作社的优待，而不积极地去组织社员自己的力量，不去加强成本核算来为社员服务。这种错误的思想和作法，曾使合作社工作走了许多弯路。
    全国合作社工作者会议召开之后，北京市供销合社总社结合整风运动，进行了关于合作社的政策和业务的学习，检查了工作，批判了上述错误思想，强调合作社必须为社员服务，要尽一切可能去满足社员的需要，使社员获得更廉价的商品。经验证明，整顿合作社工作应从业务上着手，具体采取各种有效的措施。
    为了使合作社能够切实为社员服务，首先要精简业务集中资金。北京市供销合作总社在这一方面所采取的办法是取消了门市零售和市场批发，因而节省了六十五个干部来加强采购、运输和经济核算的工作。他们所供销的商品从原来的一千零三十一种减至七百种，最近还要减少二百种，以便集中有限的资金去经营社员的主要必需品的供销业务。经过这一转变之后，对于非社员的交易额由七月份的百分之二十四减为十月份的百分之四点三。而且，这一部分主要的是处理旧存的冷货及对机关部队的部分供给。正因为尽力解决了社员的需要，使销货总额大为增加，其价值由七月份的一百一十八亿元增至十月份的一百五十三亿元，增加了百分之二十八点四。这就说明了精简业务集中资金的重大意义。
    根据社员的需要，主动地有计划地实行定时、定量、定质、定价（比较廉价）配售必需品，并收购农民社员的农副产品，应该成为合作社业务经营的基本方针。北京市供销合作总社曾有重点地调查了社员的购买力和社员所需要的商品的种类及数量，订出业务经营计划，然后按照计划进行采购，实行配售。这样，社员满意了，货物畅销了，资金周转也加快了。在这个业务经营的方针下，通过基层合作社，配售几种主要的商品，供给社员，最为社员所欢迎与拥护。
    但是，要使社员满意地得到廉价的必需品，合作社就必须到产地采购，直接向工厂、矿山定货，自己加工，精打细算，尽力降低成本。直接向产地和生产者采购货物，就可以避免或减少中间的剥削，使社员获得廉价的商品。北京市供销合作总社从产地采购来的大米、鲜果、盐等类商品卖给社员，较市价便宜了百分之十五至二十五，就是明显的例证。但是，各地合作社要到外区采购货物，事先应由上级加以组织，按照全国合作总社的规定，有计划地采购，以免发生混乱，形成抢购。这一点是十分重要的。直接向工厂、矿山定货，也有同样的作用。比如向国营企业公司所属厂矿订立供应合同，就可以保证商品的来源和价廉物美。合作社自己加工的作用也是这样。因为凡是自己加工的货品，都可以比市场上的批发价便宜许多。一个地区的合作总社只要有了具体的销货计划，那末，在运输上也就有条件得到很大便利。货物运到车站就可以由各基层的合作社直接取走，大大节省了运输费、仓库费和不必要的损耗。北京市供销合作总社的经验已经充分证明，实行这些办法，认真地精打细算，并在国营经济的扶助之下，合作社售给社员的几种主要商品，都可以比市价便宜许多，合作社的业务就会得到广大社员的支持，而蒸蒸日上。
    正确掌握价格政策也是合作社业务上的一个关键问题。合作社计算价格的原则是原价加运费、利息、伤耗、包装、折旧、印花税再加最高不超过百分之二的利润。这就是它对基层社的批发价格。北京市供销合作总社执行这个价格政策，已有显著成效。它在北京市工厂中的定货，一律由各基层合作社直接去取，不加利润或仅加很低的利息。它规定基层社的毛利最高不得超过百分之七。由总社批发的商品，各基层社必须按总社规定的价格出售，不许提高，也不许降低。这就防止了个别合作社不顾社员利益的惟利是图思想，也保证了正当合理的利润。
    采取了上述各项措施，认真整顿了合作社业务，使社员得到了实际利益之后，社员立即感到加入合作社的好处。社员对合作社关心了，对合作社的要求也就会多起来了。个别社员对合作社即便还有不正确的批评或要求，也会立刻遭到其他社员的反驳。在这种情况下，只要领导上抓紧在社内展开民主运动，召开理监事会、代表会或社员大会，检查业务方针和干部作风，制订各种制度，合作社就会进一步巩固起来。北京市供销合作总社正是因为这样做了，使得社员中原来要退股的，现在不退了；已经退了的又重新回来要求入社；入股不交钱的“名誉社员”也主动地交清了股金；非社员也积极要求入社了。北京郊区合作社在十月下旬的十几天中，就增加了百分之六点一的社员和百分之五点四的股金。各地合作社应该重视这些经验，努力贯彻全国合作会议的精神，积极整顿自己的业务，掌握正确的方针，把合作社办好。
