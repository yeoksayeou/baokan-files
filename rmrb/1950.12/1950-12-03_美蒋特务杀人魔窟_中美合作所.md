    The Sino-American Special Agent's Murderous Den
    ——"The Sino-American Cooperative Organization"
    Before the liberation of Chongqing, the area near Ciqikou in the northwestern suburbs of the city was the location of the "civilized" American fascist bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's murderous den – "The Sino-American Cooperative Organization." This was the headquarters of the fascist special agent organization established by American imperialism in China, attempting to rule China. The full name of the organization was "The Sino-American Special Technical Cooperative Organization," established in 1942. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched his loyal executioner Dai Li to serve as "Director," and the American government sent U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Miles to serve as "Deputy Director." In reality, this murderous organ was directly under the command of the American special agent headquarters.
    The "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" had a very large structure. It occupied an area of about twenty li, with more than eight hundred buildings scattered in mountain valleys, hillsides, and ridges, surrounded by countless bunkers and guard posts. Here, not only were there gloomy prisons and murderous quicklime pits, but also American-built arsenals – storing cannons, machine guns, pistols and other murderous weapons, and classrooms for the large-capacity "Special Police Training Class" – a place for Americans to train Chinese special agents. Not only did American naval special agents participate here, but also special agents from the U.S. Army Strategic Services participated. American special agents came and went in an endless stream, constantly maintaining a force of about a thousand people. Miles successively trained a large number of special agent personnel for Chiang Kai-shek here, and taught them the use of various new-style killing weapons and poisons. Within the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," there was also a special police dog training class, where American fascist special agents trained police dogs how to bite people. American special agents also received Mandarin training at the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization." The den also had a huge radio station to communicate with the Washington special agent headquarters.
    Among these buildings, there were two dark and sunless hells on earth – Bai Mansion and Zhazidong. Bai Mansion prison was used to detain so-called "serious" revolutionaries, holding over a hundred people at its peak. Zhazidong prison held up to seven or eight hundred revolutionaries at its peak, and no less than two or three hundred at its lowest. On the barren mountains and withered trees between these two prisons, alarm bells were hung. In the pitch-black night, every five minutes, the alarm bell would ring once, using terrifying sounds to warn the sentries guarding the prison, strictly preventing the revolutionaries from escaping. The outstanding Chinese sons and daughters detained in the prisons suffered all kinds of torture. American and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents often used "electric torture" to devastate the revolutionaries' nerves, vainly attempting to shake their strong and unyielding will. The American-made electrical device used for electric torture was similar to a doctor's stethoscope, and it was hung around the neck of the tortured. When the current was weak, the tortured person's whole body would undergo violent tremors and convulsions, and quickly fall into a coma. When the power was increased, the tortured person often rolled on the ground, emitting a strong burning smell. The special agents also often used American-made rubber gourds filled with concentrated pepper juice or urine, pouring it into the nostrils of the victims, and the victims would immediately spit out large mouthfuls of fresh blood from their mouths.
    In the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," the American and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents killed an unknown number of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters, which has not yet been counted. Among them, a larger mass slaughter took place on the eve of Chongqing's liberation. When Chiang Kai-shek's remnants were fleeing in a panic, on November 27th of last year, they collectively slaughtered more than three hundred revolutionary martyrs detained in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization." On that night, among the more than three hundred patriots who died in the indiscriminate shooting and flames, there were more than thirty women and seven children and infants. The female communist Zuo Shaoying was shot to death by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents with an American-style submachine gun along with her daughter whom she gave birth to in prison.
    After the liberation of Chongqing, people from all walks of life in the city, filled with incomparable grief and indignation, went to this murderous den of American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents to pay their respects one after another. They saw piles of electric torture equipment and handcuffs scattered on the ground, all of which were clearly engraved with the English words "Made in USA." From the gate of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" to Bai Mansion and Zhazidong, there were corpses of the deceased everywhere. According to the victims who escaped at that time, the people held in Zhazidong were concentrated in eight prison cells and shot to death with machine guns and carbines. After the special agents committed the crime, they burned the houses. Therefore, the eight prison cells were all piled with blackened corpses with incomplete limbs. The people held in Bai Mansion were taken out in batches and stabbed to death with knives or shot. At that time, the heroic slogans echoing one after another inside and outside the prison formed a chorus that resounded through the desolate mountains.

### 美蒋特务杀人魔窟——“中美合作所”

    美蒋特务杀人魔窟
    ——“中美合作所”
    重庆市解放前，该市西北郊磁器口附近的山环间，是“文明”的美国法西斯强盗和蒋介石匪帮杀人魔窟——“中美合作所”的所在地。这是美帝国主义在中国设立的企图统治中国的法西斯特务组织的大本营。该所的全名是“中美特种技术合作所”，成立于一九四二年。当时由蒋匪介石派他的忠实刽子手戴笠任“主任”，美国政府派美国海军部梅乐斯中校任“副主任”。实际上，该杀人机关是直接受美国特务总机构指挥的。
    “中美合作所”的机构是很庞大的。占地纵横约二十余里，有八百多间建筑物分散在山坳、山腰和岗峦上，四周是无数的堡垒和岗亭。这里不但有阴森森的牢狱和杀人的镪水坑，还有美国建造的军火库——藏有大炮、机枪、手枪等杀人武器，容量很大的“特种警察训练班”的教室——美国训练中国特务的场所。这里不仅有美国海军特务参加，还有美国陆军战略局的特务参加。美国特务往来不绝，经常保持一千人左右。梅乐斯先后在这里为蒋匪训练了大批特务人员，并传授给他们以各种新式杀人凶器和毒药的用法。“中美合作所”内，还设有一个特殊的警犬训练班，由美国法西斯特务训练警犬如何咬人。美国特务也曾在“中美合作所”受华语训练。魔窟中还设有一座巨大的电台与华盛顿特务总机构通报。
    在这些建筑中间，有两个暗无天日的人间地狱——白公馆和渣滓洞。白公馆牢狱，是关禁所谓“案情”较重的革命者的，关人最多的时候，达百人以上。渣滓洞牢狱关禁的革命者，最多时有七、八百人，少时也有二、三百人。在这两所牢狱之间的荒山枯树上，都挂着警钟。在黑魆魆的深夜里，每隔五分钟，警钟就敲响一次，用恐怖的声浪，警告看守牢监的哨兵，严防革命者越狱。被拘禁在牢狱里的中国优秀儿女们，遭受着各种毒刑。美蒋特务们常以“电刑”摧残革命者的神经，妄想动摇他们坚强不屈的意志。施用电刑时的美式传电器与医生的听诊器相似，将它挂在受刑者的颈项上。电流微弱时，受刑者全身发生剧烈的震动和痉挛，并迅即昏迷。电力加强时，受刑者常卧地滚动，身上发出强烈的焦臭味。特务们也常用美国制的橡皮葫芦装满花椒浓汁或尿水，从受难者的鼻孔中倒灌进去，受难者便立刻从口腔里喷出大口鲜血。
    在“中美合作所”里，美蒋特务一共杀死了多少中国优秀儿女，现在还没有统计。其中，较大的一次集体屠杀，就在重庆解放前夕。蒋匪残余在仓惶逃溃时，于去年十一月二十七日集体屠杀了拘禁在“中美合作所”的三百多位革命志士。当天晚上死于乱枪扫射和烈火中的三百多位爱国者中，有三十多个妇女和七个儿童及婴儿。女共产党员左绍英，就是和她在狱中生产的女儿一齐被蒋匪特务用美式冲锋枪打死的。
    重庆解放后，该市各界人民都怀着无比的悲愤，络绎不绝地到这美蒋特务的杀人魔窟去凭吊过。他们看见一堆堆的散落在地上的电刑器材和手铐，上面都清晰地刻着英文“美国造”的字样。从“中美合作所”大门到白公馆、渣滓洞的路上，到处是死难者的尸首。据当时脱逃出来的受难者说，关在渣滓洞的人，是被集中在八间牢房里用机关枪和卡宾枪射杀的。特务们在行凶后，又焚烧房子。因此八间牢房里全堆满了被烧得肢体不全的乌黑尸体。被关在白公馆的人，是被分批提出去乱刀戳死或枪杀的。当时狱内狱外此起彼伏的壮烈口号声，曾汇成一片，响彻了荒凉的山野。
