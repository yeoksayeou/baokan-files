The "People's Democratic Countries Film Week" began on the 11th of this month. The first film shown, the Czechoslovak feature film "Silent Defense," drew particularly large crowds. When images of Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Czechoslovak leader Gottwald appeared on the screen, the entire audience applauded in welcome. The film depicts the heroic struggle of the Czechoslovak people against the German fascist occupation forces, showing their arduous fight until the very end, and their final victory and liberation with the help of the Soviet Red Army. It possesses great and glorious historical significance. When the documentary "The Revolt of the Toys" was screened, it was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. This film uses a puppet show format to express the spirit of the people's resistance against the Nazis, while also fully demonstrating the high artistic talent of Czechoslovak puppet dramatists. The screening of the Czechoslovak film coincided with the arrival of the Czechoslovak cultural delegation in Beijing the day before. They were all excited and pleased to be able to see films from their own country upon arriving in China. Comrades from China's literary and art circles, including Zhou Yang, Ding Xielin, Ding Ling, and Shakov, attended the screenings.

【Our Newspaper News】The "People's Democratic Countries Film Week," organized by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Ministry of Culture in Beijing, was originally scheduled to end on the 17th. It has now been decided to extend it by one day. On the afternoon of the 18th, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, the documentaries "The Mongolian People's Republic" and "The 29th Anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution" from the Mongolian People's Republic will be screened.
