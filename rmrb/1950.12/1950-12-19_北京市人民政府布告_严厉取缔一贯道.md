[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to safeguard the interests of the people and maintain social order, issued an announcement today (19th) stipulating measures for strictly banning Yiguandao and all secret societies. The full text of the announcement is as follows:

Having investigated, Yiguandao is a counter-revolutionary and anti-people feudal superstitious organization. Under the manipulation of its reactionary leaders, it has consistently colluded with Japanese invaders, traitors, and American-Chiang agents to carry out various criminal activities that betray the country and harm the people. The ignorant and backward masses who have been deceived or coerced into joining the Dao are also deeply poisoned by it. Many have been defrauded of their money, even to the point of bankruptcy; many female Dao members have been raped or tricked into sexual relations, even forced into prostitution; some Dao members have been subjected to torture and even brutally murdered. Therefore, the former North China People's Government declared it an illegal organization as early as January 1949 and explicitly ordered its ban. However, its reactionary leaders have persisted in their evil ways and have dared to continue acting as American-Chiang spies and secret agents after liberation, spreading rumors, intimidating the masses, and even plotting armed rebellion, which is truly an egregious crime. In order to safeguard the interests of the people, maintain social order, and rescue the deceived masses who have gone astray, this government has decided to strictly ban it and stipulate the following measures:

1.  From the date of this announcement, all secret societies shall be immediately dissolved and shall not engage in any further activities.

2.  Important elements of Yiguandao above the rank of "Dian Chuan Shi" (Initiating Teacher) and others engaged in political sabotage activities shall be immediately arrested and punished according to the severity of their circumstances in accordance with the law. Those who have not committed major crimes and have genuinely repented and shown factual evidence of their repentance shall be treated with leniency.

3.  Those below the rank of "Dian Chuan Shi" but above the rank of "Jia Tan Zhu" (Family Altar Head) (including "San Cai" - Three Talents) shall immediately register with the Public Security Sub-bureau in their respective jurisdictions, hand over organizational relationships, sacrificial utensils, public property, etc. of the Dao, and provide a written guarantee to the government to cease all activities. Violators will be severely punished according to the law.

4.  All masses who have been deceived or coerced into joining Yiguandao, once they withdraw from the organization and cease all activities, shall be exempt from prosecution and may accuse or pursue the "Dian Chuan Shi," "Tan Zhu," etc. of the Dao for their past crimes of deceiving and oppressing the masses, and recover the defrauded property.

5.  Regardless of whether they are ordinary Dao members, "Tan Zhu," or "Dian Chuan Shi" of Yiguandao, those who repent sincerely, actively assist the government in exposing the various counter-revolutionary and anti-people criminal activities of Yiguandao, report hidden or fleeing major criminals, and have made significant achievements, will be rewarded by this government according to the magnitude of their achievements.

6.  People from all walks of life in this city can report on the activities of Yiguandao. Those whose reports are substantiated and lead to the cracking of cases will be rewarded by the government.

The above measures are hereby ordered to be implemented immediately by the Public Security Bureau of this government, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life in the city will fully assist in their implementation.

    北京市人民政府布告            
    严厉取缔一贯道
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为保障人民利益，维护社会秩序，今（十九）日发出布告，规定严厉取缔一贯道及所有会道门办法。布告全文如下：
    查一贯道是反革命、反人民的封建迷信组织，在其反动首领操纵下，一向与日寇、汉奸及美蒋特务勾结，进行各种出卖国家，危害人民的罪恶活动，而一般被欺骗或被胁迫入道的无知落后群众，亦深受其毒害：许多被诈骗钱财，甚至倾家荡产；不少女道徒被强奸骗奸，甚至被逼卖淫；有些道徒遭受非刑拷打，甚至惨被杀害。因此，前华北人民政府早于一九四九年一月，即曾宣布其为非法组织，明令加以取缔，乃其反动首领怙恶不悛，竟敢于解放后继续充当美蒋的特务奸细，散播谣言，恐吓群众，甚至阴谋武装暴动，实属罪恶昭彰。本府为保障人民利益，维护社会秩序，并挽救误入歧途的受骗群众，决予严厉取缔，并规定办法如左：
    一、自布告之日起，所有会道门应一律立即解散，不得再有任何活动。
    二、一贯道点传师以上的重要分子及其他有政治破坏活动者，立即予以逮捕，并按其情节轻重依法惩办。凡无重大罪行并真正悔过自新且有事实表现者，均予宽大处理。
    三、点传师以下家坛主以上分子（包括三才），应即自行向本市各该管公安分局进行登记，交出道中组织关系、供具、公产等，并向政府具结停止一切活动，违者依法严惩。
    四、所有被欺骗、被胁迫参加一贯道之群众，一经脱离组织，停止一切活动，即免予追究，并得控诉或追究该道点传师、坛主等过去欺骗压迫群众之罪行，追回被骗之财物。
    五、不论一贯道之一般道徒或坛主、点传师，凡翻然悔悟，积极帮助政府揭露一贯道之各种反革命、反人民的罪恶活动，检举隐蔽或潜逃的罪行重大分子，并有显著成绩者，本府将依其成绩大小予以奖励。
    六、凡本市各界人士对一贯道之活动可进行检举，其检举有据且因而破案者，由政府予以奖励。
    以上办法着令本府公安局立即执行，并望全市各阶层人民全力予以协助。
