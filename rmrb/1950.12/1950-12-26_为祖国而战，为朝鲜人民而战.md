    Fighting for the Motherland, Fighting for the Korean People

    First Taste of Combat

    In late October, on the North Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people, tasted their first combat, thwarting the American imperialist aggressor gang's ferocious flames, and forcing the bandits who clamored to occupy the Yalu River before "Thanksgiving" to retreat in disgrace south of the Chongchon River.

    The brave warriors of the Volunteer Army won this victory in fighting against enemies armed to the teeth with fully automatic weapons and backed by a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks. The bandits relied entirely on steel and gunpowder, firing hundreds of shells just to attack a small hill. But the factor that determines the victory of a war is not weapons, but the people who wield them. Volunteer soldier Wang You said it well: "Airplanes can't come down and grab people, cannons can't be used for bayonet charges, and when tanks come, it's time to make a contribution!" From some snippets of the Battle of Unsan, we can see how brave and tenacious these people with a high degree of fighting will were in defeating the bandits who relied on their "superior weapons."

    On a small hill forty li southeast of Unsan, a company of our People's Volunteer Army was holding the line. Two companies of the U.S. invading army's 1st Cavalry Division were attacking them. More than a dozen cannons relentlessly bombarded the hilltop, and seven or eight airplanes strafed and bombed the hilltop all day long. The hilltop was never free from the roar of explosions, and was constantly covered in thick smoke. The enemy probably thought that even if they didn't hit anyone, they would shake the other side and render them incapable of resistance. But the soldiers, entrenched in strong fortifications, kept a close watch on the enemy, saying, "No matter how fierce the attack, you won't be able to seize an inch of our position!" The enemy launched five assaults on the hill, but were all repulsed with bayonets and grenades by the Volunteer soldiers, leaving behind several corpses and fleeing back. For four days and five nights, the hilltop was transformed, but the position remained firmly in place. This heroic company suffered only two casualties.

    The situation was completely opposite when the Volunteer Army attacked the enemy: it was like sweeping away rotten wood. On November 1st, in Yongdu-dong, southeast of Unsan, a company of the Volunteer Army launched an attack on a company of the enemy, eliminating all the bandits at the cost of only twenty casualties, capturing fourteen and killing or wounding more than eighty. Perhaps this was too embarrassing for the "elite U.S. troops." On the 2nd, the enemy sent five tanks and six hundred infantry to counterattack. The bandits used airplanes to spray gasoline and drop incendiary bombs on the hill, turning the hilltop into a sea of fire, attempting to force back this company. But the enemies who rushed up were again met by the Volunteer Army's bayonets, forcing the enemy to squat down the mountain for three days and unable to advance a single step, they had no choice but to turn around and flee.

    Faced with such an opponent, the American "heroes" who "cannot attack and cannot defend" have only one path: to escape! Who knew that in front of the swift-moving Volunteer Army, this most skilled trick also became ineffective. The company guarding the mountain top at Dongzhan, discovered that the enemy was retreating after an unsuccessful attack and immediately rose up to pursue them. They agilely crossed four large mountains, rushed up to the mountain where the enemy had no command post. The enemies in their sleep had no time to distinguish who they were, grenades had already blossomed around them, some were so frightened that they rolled down the mountain in their downy bags. Another company chased the fleeing enemy for forty li in one breath, giving the bandits no time to catch their breath and organize a counterattack. Soldier Zhang Youjun, holding a submachine gun that had run out of bullets, single-handedly pursued five American soldiers, the enemies did not dare to shoot at him.

    Throughout the Unsan battlefield, American heavy tanks lay stiffly, and the encounters of these armored enemies further demonstrate the amazing bravery of the Volunteer soldiers. Seventeen-year-old soldier Luo Liangsi, wounded, inserted two explosive packs into the tank's wheels, and soldier Wang You fought a tank single-handedly for an hour. In front of this tank that was constantly firing and strafing, he ran back and forth to his own position four times, bringing back grenades, explosives, and explosive packs, and finally subdued this armored enemy.

    True Gold Fears No Fire

    Since crossing the border, the brave warriors of the Volunteer Army have been living and fighting in such an environment: in the chilling dark nights, on dangerous and rugged mountain roads, often marching eighty to one hundred thirty li, and after reaching their destination, spending most of their time sleeping on the mountains. The soldiers would dig shelters as soon as they stopped, and surround themselves with some corn stalks and straw to make their "dormitories." With more people than straw, some had to sleep in the open, their eyebrows and beards covered with a layer of white frost after dawn. During combat, they often went without food all day, or only ate a full cob of corn. There was no water on the mountains, only snow to eat. Undoubtedly, this was a very harsh environment, one that was difficult for ordinary people to endure. But the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation not only endured hardship but also overcame it. "True gold fears no fire!" "The Chinese people are born with the hard bones to overcome all difficulties!" In the midst of hard living and fighting, the brave warriors of the Volunteer Army shouted such slogans.

    A certain unit, ordered to encircle and annihilate the enemy at Chushan, passed through a two-thousand-meter-high mountain on their march, climbing up and down for eight hours. The phrases "Climbing over the high mountain is victory!" and "Overcoming difficulties is victory!" encouraged everyone, and the soldiers climbed towards victory all night long. Wang Shangqing carried no less than ninety catties of equipment, marched eighty li overnight, and developed five blisters on his feet, but he didn't complain or ask to be replaced. The mountain road was steep and pack animals could not pass, so the artillerymen unloaded the gun bodies and carriages and carried them on their shoulders. Although their shoulders were swollen, they successfully reached their destination and annihilated the enemy. In a certain company advancing towards Taechon, five sick soldiers followed along as usual. The company decided to let them rest temporarily, but the five soldiers cried anxiously: "We'll crawl to that place if we have to!" "If you can win glory for the motherland, can't we?" They insisted on walking all the way to the destination and participating in the battle.

    On the battlefield, this high morale reached its peak. The soldiers, who often ate only one full cob of corn or potato soup a day, often talked about how to eliminate the enemy and how to ask for the main attack mission. At the moment when a certain battalion was about to enter the battle, the company and platoon leaders requesting the main attack mission crowded the battalion headquarters, and one company commander even sat down and waited, refusing to leave if he was not given the main attack mission. A squad leader who had requested the main attack mission from the company several times, heard that his squad was assigned to the second echelon, and was so anxious that he didn't eat all day. He Chengjun, the political instructor of a certain company, who was seriously ill, asked the orderly to help him into the trenches, and encouraged the soldiers in the sound of artillery fire to "make contributions to the motherland!" and "Avenge the Korean people!" It was in this company that the hero Wei Dianfu appeared. A bullet entered his left shoulder, but he still charged towards the enemy. According to his injuries, he should have gone to the dressing station, but he climbed onto a tank, pried open the tank lid with a bayonet, and killed the enemies inside!

    True gold is not afraid of fire! These outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation carried forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation of perseverance and hard work, and thus they overcame high mountains and rivers, overcame hunger and cold, won victories, and annihilated the enemy!

    The Source of Strength

    An American prisoner of war asked a combatant of the Volunteer Army: "We want to rest after fighting for a few hours a day, and we have to take cars for marching. Why don't you care even if you're hungry for three days? Can you still fight after marching a hundred or so li on foot? Do you still charge regardless of daytime or nighttime air raids?" He wondered if the People's Volunteer Army were "real people"?

    We can tell him: They are real people! But the difference is that they are all great fighters with armed minds, with a high degree of political awareness of patriotism and internationalism.

    The boundless anger aroused by the crimes of the American imperialists invading Korea and invading China is the source of their strength in creating heroic miracles. Wang You, who had fought a tank for an hour, said: "Didn't the Japanese devils occupy Northeast China by first occupying Korea? This time the American devils are invading Korea, they have long planned on our China in their hearts! If not, why did they occupy Taiwan? Why did they bomb Andong? Can we not come out to defend the motherland's gate?" Before joining the Volunteer Army, he was a farmer in Northeast China. He also clearly remembered: "Korean comrades helped us liberate the Northeast. This time, our neighbor's house is on fire, can we just watch and not help?" Wei Dianfu, who was wounded while attacking a tank, said: "I must personally kill a few American devils to vent my hatred. Why do they always invade us!" Therefore, he was determined: "I will not return home without making a contribution!" Me Xingfu, who saw the Yalu River for the first time, said: "So the Yalu River is so narrow, if the American devils hit this, will we have a good time?" This made him pull out the bullet that hit his shoulder on the battlefield and continue to charge!

    The deep suffering brought to the Korean people by the invading army of American imperialism further strengthened their hatred for the enemy. When the fifth squad of a certain unit cleaned the battlefield, they saw the refugees who had been killed by the American imperialist shells. They sadly buried these corpses, and the soldiers automatically went to the political instructor to express their determination: "The Korean people are suffering too much! We can't go back without eliminating the enemy!" Almost all the large and small villages along the road of advancement were destroyed and burned by the American aerial bandits. The elderly and women who survived the tiger's mouth cried while stroking the corpses, and searched for the remaining property with tears in their eyes. Who wouldn't be filled with righteous indignation after seeing these? Soldier Chen Dehui was so enraged that he couldn't bear it, and he automatically proposed to be an anti-tank fighter. He spent his own money to make a wooden box, grabbed the explosives from others and packed them inside, and carried it on his body every day: "I must avenge the Korean people!"

    In every company and battalion command post of the Volunteer Army, one can see bundles and bundles of letters of determination, some are individual, some are collective from squads and platoons, some are in brush-written regular script, some are carbon copies on soft paper, some are rows and rows of soldiers' seals, ... From these different sentences and different handwriting, one can seem to see the solemn and serious faces of the Volunteer soldiers when they wrote these letters of determination, and one can feel their excited and angry mood. A letter of determination signed by Wang Shijie, Shi Xinde, and more than twenty others reads: "The American imperialists' attempt to expand the Eastern war is obvious. Their attack on the Korean people is the first step in attacking the Chinese people and the people of the world. Therefore, they are not only the mortal enemies of the Korean people, but also the mortal enemies of the Chinese people and the people of the world! In order to ensure the security of the motherland, ensure world peace, and help liberate the Korean people, we are determined to raise our iron fists to crush the American imperialist's claws and bury the invading bandits on the Korean peninsula!" For such a glorious righteous act, the soldiers of the Volunteer Army have made many guarantees in their letters of determination. These are the guarantee conditions of the entire company: "1. Resolutely complete the task under any difficult conditions, not afraid of the cold and snow, not afraid of narrow and slippery roads, not afraid of not being able to eat or live in houses, and do not complain! 2. Cherish every tree, every grass, every mountain, and every river of the Korean people, do not take a needle or a thread from the Korean people, abide by all the policies and decrees of the Korean People's Government, and respect the customs and habits of the Korean people. 3. Respect General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, as we respect the leader of our own motherland! 4. Establish a brotherly and close relationship with the heroic Korean People's Army, unite seamlessly, help each other, and learn from each other!"

    The great desire to fight for the motherland and fight for the Korean people made them utter such solemn oaths, and these oaths became the indicator of their actions, enabling them to win victories in difficult and arduous environments and in front of enemies armed to the teeth. The suspicion of the imperialist elements is not surprising at all. The heroic actions shown by the People's Volunteer Army on the North Korean battlefield will never be understood by these greedy, brutal, cowardly, and ignorant enemies!

### 为祖国而战，为朝鲜人民而战

    为祖国而战，为朝鲜人民而战
    初试锋芒
    十月末，在朝北战场上，和朝鲜人民并肩作战的中国人民志愿部队，初试锋芒就挫败了美帝侵略匪帮的凶焰，逼使叫嚷着“感恩节”以前侵占鸭绿江边的匪徒们，狼狈地退到清川江以南。
    志愿部队的勇士们是和全部使用自动武器并有大量飞机、大炮、坦克掩护的武装到了牙齿的敌人搏斗中赢得胜利的。匪徒们，一切都依靠钢铁、火药，进攻一个小小的山头竟也排射几百发炮弹。但决定战争胜利的因素不是武器，而是掌握着武器的人。志愿军战士王友说得好：“飞机不能下来抓人，大炮不能顶刺刀用，坦克来了立功的时候就到了！”从云山之战的一些片断故事里就可以看出，这些有着高度战斗意志的人，在击败自恃“武器精良”的匪徒时是怎样地勇敢与顽强。
    云山东南四十里的小山上，守着我人民志愿军的一个连，美国侵略军骑一师两个连在向这里进攻。十几门大炮从不停息地向山顶轰击，七、八架飞机终日向山顶扫射轰炸，山顶从没中断过爆炸的轰鸣，山顶一直被浓密的硝烟覆盖着，敌人也许以为这样即或打不着人，也会把对方震得失去抵抗能力。但守在强固工事里的战士们却一直在严密地监视着敌人，他们说：“打得再凶也别想侵占我们一寸阵地！”敌人向山上发动了五次冲锋，都被志愿军战士的刺刀、手榴弹痛击一顿，丢下几具死尸逃回去。四天五夜，山顶虽已改观，阵地却仍屹然不动，这个英雄的连队只伤亡两名。
    和这完全相反的情况是：当志愿部队向敌人进攻时，则又如摧枯拉朽。十一月一日，在云山东南龙头洞，志愿军的一个连向敌人的一个连发起攻击，只以二十人的伤亡代价，就把匪徒们全部解决，俘十四，毙伤八十多。也许这太使“美军精锐”们难堪了，二日，敌人调来五辆坦克六百步兵反击，匪徒们用飞机向山上洒汽油、投燃烧弹，把山顶变成一片火海，企图逼退这个连队，但冲上来的敌人又被志愿军的刺刀迎回去，敌人在山下蹲了三天，不得前进一步，只好转头逃掉。
    面临这样一个对手，“攻不动、守不住”的美国“英雄”们只有一条道路：逃命！谁知在神速的志愿军面前，这最拿手的好戏也失去效用了。守洞站山头的连队，发现进攻不逞的敌人开始溃退时，当即奋起追击，他们敏捷地翻过四个大山，冲上敌人没有指挥所的山上，睡梦中的敌人还没来得及辨别是什么人，手榴弹早已在他们的身边开了花，有的竟吓得装在鸭绒口袋里滚下山去。另一个连队曾一口气把溃逃的敌人追出四十里，使匪徒们没能得到半点喘息时间组织反击。战士张友君，拿着一支已经打光子弹的冲锋枪，只身追击五个美军，敌人竟不敢向他开枪。
    云山战场上，到处僵卧着美军的重型坦克，这些装甲敌人的遭遇更可以说明志愿军战士们惊人的勇敢。十七岁的小战士罗亮泗，带伤把两个爆破筒插进坦克轮带，战士王友单人与坦克搏斗了一个小时，他在这个不停地开炮、扫射的坦克面前，往自己的阵地返复跑了四次，他先后拿来手榴弹、炸药、爆破筒，终于制服了这装甲敌人。
    真金不怕火炼
    出国以来，志愿部队的勇士们一直是在这样的环境里生活、战斗的：在寒气袭人的暗夜里，在险阻崎岖的山路上，常常是八十到百三十里的长行军，到达了目的地之后又绝大部分的时间是睡在山上，战士们停住脚就要挖掩体，围上一些苞米秸、稻草就成了自己的“宿舍”，人多草少，有的只好露天睡在里边，天明以后眉毛胡子上凝结了一层白霜。战斗过程中，他们常常是整天吃不到饭，或是只吃到一顿整苞米，山上没有水，只有吃雪。毫无疑问，这是非常艰苦的环境，是一般人所难以忍受的艰苦环境，但是，中华民族的优秀儿女们不仅忍受了艰苦而且战胜了艰苦，“真金不怕火炼！”“中华人民生就了战胜一切艰难困苦的硬骨头！”在艰苦的生活、战斗中，志愿军的勇士们喊出了这样的声音。
    奉命围歼楚山之敌的某某部队，进军的道路上通过了一个二千米的高山，爬上爬下得八个钟点。“爬过高山就是胜利！”“战胜困难就是胜利！”的语句鼓舞着大家，战士们连夜向胜利攀缘。王尚清的身上装备不下九十斤，一夜行军八十里，脚上磨起五个水泡，没啃气，也没用别人替换。山路陡峭驮子不能走，炮手们卸下炮身、炮架扛在自己的肩上，虽然压肿了两肩，却胜利地赶到目的地歼灭了敌人。向泰川进军的某连，有五个病号照样跟着走，连里决定叫他们暂时休养，这五个战士急得哭了：“爬也要爬到那个地方！”“你们能为祖国争光我们就不能吗？”他们一直都坚持走到目的地，并且参加了战斗。
    在战场，这样高昂的斗志更是到了顶点，常常一天只吃一顿整苞米或土豆汤的战士们，嘴上经常谈论的是怎样消灭敌人，怎样要求下来主攻任务。某营在即将投入战斗的时刻，要求主攻任务的连、排长挤满了营部，一个连长竟坐下等着，不给主攻任务就不想走。一个曾经几次向连里要求主攻任务的班长，听说自己的班被编为第二梯队，竟急得一天没吃饭。生着重病的某连指导员贺成君，叫通讯员扶着走进战壕，在炮声中鼓动战士们“为祖国立功！”“为朝鲜人民复仇！”就在这个连队里，出现了英雄人物魏殿福，子弹从他的左肩打进去还是向着敌人冲击；按他的伤势，应该去找包扎所，但他爬上了一辆坦克，用刺刀撬开坦克盖打死了里面的敌人！
    真金是不怕火炼的！这些中华民族的优秀儿女们发扬了中华民族坚忍不拔刻苦耐劳的光荣传统，因而他们战胜了高山大川，战胜了饥饿寒冷，赢得了胜利，歼灭了敌人！
    力量的源泉
    一个美军俘虏问过志愿军的战斗员：“我们一天打几个钟头仗就想休息，行军都得坐汽车。为什么你们饿三天也不理会？徒步行军百十里还能作战？不管白天黑夜飞机轰炸照样冲锋？”他怀疑，人民志愿军是不是“真人”？
    可以告诉他：是真人！但不同的是他们都是有着武装的头脑，有着高度的政治觉悟的爱国主义、国际主义的伟大斗士。
    被美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜侵略中国的罪行所激起的无比愤怒，是他们创造英雄奇迹的力量源泉。曾经和坦克搏斗了一个小时的王友说过：“过去日本鬼子占东北还不是先占朝鲜？美国鬼子这回侵略朝鲜，心眼里早就盘算着咱们中国呢！若不，他为什么占台湾？为什么炸安东？咱们不出来保卫祖国的大门能行吗？”他在参加志愿军以前是东北的一个农民，他还清楚地记得：“朝鲜同志帮助咱们解放过东北，这回邻居失火了，咱们还能看着不救？”负伤打坦克的魏殿福曾表示：“一定要亲手打死几个美国鬼子解解恨，为什么他们老是侵略我们！”因而他决心：“不立功不回国！”第一次看见鸭绿江的么兴福说：“原来鸭绿江这么窄，美国鬼子打到这，咱们还有个好？”这就使他在战场上拔掉打中肩上的子弹继续冲锋！
    美帝国主义侵略军队带给朝鲜人民的深重灾难更增强了他们对敌人的仇恨。某部五班在打扫战场时看到被美帝炮弹炸死的难民，他们沉痛地掩埋了这些尸体，战士们自动去找政治指导员下决心：“朝鲜老百姓太苦了！我们不消灭敌人不能回去！”进军道路上的大小村庄几乎全被美帝空中强盗炸毁烧光，虎口余生的老人、妇女们在抚尸痛哭，在含泪寻找剩下的家产。看到了这些，谁个不义愤填膺？战士陈德辉被激怒得实在忍受不住了，他自动提出要当反坦克手，自己化钱做了个木箱，从别人手里抢过炸药包装在里面，每天背在身上：“一定要为朝鲜人民复仇！”
    在志愿部队的每个连、营指挥所里，都可以看到一束一束的决心书，有的是个人的，有的是班、排集体的，有的是毛笔楷书，有的是软纸复写，有的一排排盖着战士们的图章，……从这些不同的语句，不同的笔迹里，似乎可以看到志愿军战士们在写这些决心书时的庄重、严肃的面孔，可以体察到他们那激动、愤怒的心情。一张签着王世杰、史新德等廿几个名字的决心书上写着：“美帝国主义扩大东方战争的企图已昭然若揭，他们进攻朝鲜人民就是进攻中国人民和世界人民的第一步，因此他们不仅是朝鲜人民的死敌，也是中国人民与世界人民的死敌！为了确保祖国的安全，确保世界和平，帮助朝鲜人民解放，我们坚决举起铁拳粉碎美帝的侵略魔爪，把侵略匪帮埋葬在朝鲜半岛上！”为了这样一个光荣的义举，志愿军的战士们都在决心书上提出很多保证。这就是某连队全体的保证条件：“一、在任何艰难困苦的情况下坚决完成任务，不怕天冷雪大，不怕路窄路滑，不怕吃不上饭住不上房，不叫苦不埋怨！二、爱护朝鲜人民的一草一木一山一水，不拿朝鲜人民的一针一线，遵守朝鲜人民政府的一切政策法令，尊重朝鲜人民的风俗习惯。三、尊敬朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军像尊敬自己祖国的领袖一样！四、和英雄的朝鲜人民军建立起兄弟般的亲密感情，团结无间，互相帮助，互相学习！”
    为祖国而战，为朝鲜人民而战的伟大意愿使他们发出了这样庄严的誓言，这誓言变成了他们行动的指标，使他们在艰难困苦的环境里，在武装到牙齿的敌人面前赢得了胜利。帝国主义分子的怀疑是毫不足怪的，人民志愿军在朝北战场上所表现的英雄行为对这些贪婪、残暴、懦怯、愚昧的敌人来讲，将是永远不能理解的！
