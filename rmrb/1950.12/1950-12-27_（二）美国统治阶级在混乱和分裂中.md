(II) The American Ruling Class in Chaos and Division

The American imperialists, suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in Korea, are accelerating their decline. The state of alienation and betrayal within the American ruling class due to this decisive failure is most sharply reflected in the foreign policy speech delivered by Herbert Hoover, a leader of the American Republican Party, on the 20th of this month.

Hoover asserted that the Truman government has not only completely failed in its war of aggression in Korea, but that its aggressive plans in Western Europe are also bound to fail completely. Hoover pointed out that, as a result of the American military buildup, the American economy has encountered great danger. Hoover is undoubtedly correct on this point; he believes that the Soviet Union and New China are both absolutely invincible on the Eurasian continent. From this, he proposed a different plan of aggression from the Truman, Dulles, and Marshall groups, namely that the United States should "abandon" Korea and the European continent, and take Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines as the western "boundary" of the United States, and Britain as the eastern "boundary" of the United States.

Hoover is certainly not a conservative; he merely advocates that the United States should shorten its aggressive front somewhat compared to the present, and this shortening is only from Korea to Taiwan, and from France to Britain. On the issue of opposing China, he expressed that he would be much more intense than the so-called "United Nations." However, what is noteworthy about his speech is not these points, but the extremely important fact that he admitted to the world: the current aggressive policy of the United States has been a complete failure, and it can no longer continue as before; the internal front of American imperialism and the North Atlantic front can no longer maintain their superficial unity.

The American ruling class, headed by Truman, has consistently pursued a reactionary fascist policy since World War II, engaging in external aggression against the world outside the United States, and internal oppression of its own people. They disregarded the Potsdam Proclamation, the Cairo Declaration, the United Nations Charter, and other just agreements. They arbitrarily violated the United Nations Charter. They organized the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance. They conspired to rearm West Germany and Japan. They refused to reduce armaments and refused to abolish atomic weapons. They used Chiang Kai-shek to invade China, and after Chiang Kai-shek's failure, unreasonably refused the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations. This June, they launched the Korean War and simultaneously invaded our country's Taiwan, and bombed our country's Northeast. The reason why the Truman clique dared to run amok was that they believed they had irresistible military and economic power, and could conquer the world without an opponent. However, the ironclad facts of the Korean War over the past six months have demonstrated to the world a truth that is completely opposite to this: the American imperialist army, possessing absolute superiority in naval and air forces, as well as absolute superiority in land forces equipment, coupled with the so-called "United Nations forces" of many vassal states, is so insignificant and fragile in the face of the awakened Korean people, especially in the face of the Chinese people who have stood up. They are not only capable of being defeated, but have already been defeated. In fact, on the Korean battlefield, the imperialist camp has gathered the forces it could possibly gather at present. For the peace and democracy camp, the strength in Korea is only a very small part of our strength.

However, before Hoover's speech, the American ruling group was unwilling to publicly admit this fact, and still wanted to intimidate the world's people with empty threats. Therefore, at the Fifth United Nations General Assembly, the United States still refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, still refused to withdraw its invading forces from Taiwan, and still firmly disagreed with the entry of the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. In addition, it also expressed that it would use atomic bombs and would not hesitate to further organize the so-called "West European Allied Forces" in order to continue to carry out military intimidation. However, another part of the American ruling class saw that Truman's adventurous policy would bring them even greater disasters. They lost their composure and thus issued a public cry. Hoover's speech was precisely the first public cry of a part of the American ruling class in a state of panic. They had to say a sentence that they were absolutely unwilling to say – socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic China are already impossible to defeat.

Due to Hoover's speech, the chaos and quarrels among the American ruling class became even more acute. The American Truman government has always flaunted a foreign policy of "bipartisan consensus." The failure of the war of aggression against Korea, as well as the failure on the diplomatic front at the Fifth UN General Assembly, has led to increasingly obvious differences among the American ruling class on how to carry out aggression. Truman had attempted to conceal this division in order to stabilize his own morale. On the 19th of this month, that is, on the third day after Truman announced that the United States was in a state of "emergency" on the 16th, Truman announced: "Regarding American foreign policy," "no one" in the American ruling class leadership group "raised any objections." The very next day, Hoover's "objection" came out. Moreover, Hoover's speech did not only represent Hoover's personal opinion; most Republican congressmen in the American Congress and many representative reactionary newspapers stood on Hoover's side. Some people opposed Hoover's policy, believing that this was equivalent to "abandoning" Europe and the Asian continent, which was tantamount to admitting the failure of the United States. Others said: "If Congress supports this plan, ... it can not only save tens of billions of dollars, but also save the lives of one million American men who are destined to suffer useless sacrifices under the Truman-Acheson-Eisenhower plan." (Chicago Daily Tribune) In order to defend its extremely reactionary foreign policy and prevent the split of the American reactionary ruling group, Truman's statement on October 19th strongly emphasized Acheson's reactionary nature in order to win the cooperation of the American ruling class. He said, "If communism rules the world," "Acheson, even if he is not the first... to be shot, he will certainly be one of the first batch." (Washington, D.C., American News Service, 19th) But Truman's statement did not stop Hoover's "objection," which was just as reactionary as Acheson's. The day after Hoover's speech, Truman helplessly called for "unity" among the American ruling class, while in reality, chaos and quarrels further developed.

Hoover's speech not only made the American ruling class "greatly surprised" (Associated Press), but also caused even greater frustration in the so-called "North Atlantic Treaty" countries, which were already estranged. To the American vassal states, Hoover, after severely criticizing them for not working hard enough in the Korean War and not working hard enough in preparing for war in Western Europe, completely assumed the identity of the "master," strutted around, and expressed that he had the right to arbitrarily dispose of their fate. The so-called "British Empire" had already been designated by Hoover as the American "frontier" on the Atlantic! There is no doubt that this will greatly increase the existing contradictions between American imperialism and its Western European vassals. And the organization of the so-called Eisenhower's "West European Allied Forces" will become even more difficult.

The camp of American imperialism is becoming increasingly chaotic and divided. The patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, which is rising day by day throughout China, should continue to be upheld and expanded. The Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front should advance more bravely, strike the enemy more resolutely, and make victory come more quickly.

### （二）美国统治阶级在混乱和分裂中

    （二）美国统治阶级在混乱和分裂中
    被我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜打得大败的美帝国主义，正在加速地走着下坡路。美国统治阶级由于这个决定性的失败而陷入的众叛亲离状态，在本月二十日美国共和党首脑胡佛所发表的外交政策演说中，得到了最尖锐的反映。
    胡佛认定杜鲁门政府不但在朝鲜的侵略战争已经彻底失败，而且在西欧的侵略计划也必然彻底失败。胡佛指出：由于美国军备扩张的结果，美国经济已遭遇很大的危险。胡佛在这一点上无疑是正确的，他认为苏联和新中国在欧亚大陆上都是绝对不可战胜的国家。他由此提出了与杜鲁门、杜勒斯、马歇尔集团不同的侵略计划，即美国应当“放弃”朝鲜和西欧大陆，而以日本、台湾、菲律宾为美国的西方“边界”，以英国为美国的东方“边界”。
    胡佛当然决不是什么保守主义者；他只是主张美国应当比较现在稍为缩短一下侵略的战线，这个缩短也只是从朝鲜缩到台湾，从法国缩到英国。在反对中国的问题上，他表示自己要比所谓“联合国”激烈得多。但是他的演说令人注意的地方并不是这些，而是他向全世界承认了这样一个极端重要的事实：美国的现行侵略政策已经一败涂地，再也不能照旧继续下去了；美国帝国主义的内部阵线和北大西洋阵线，已经再也不能维持表面上的一致了。
    以杜鲁门为首的美国统治阶级，在第二次世界大战之后，一直奉行着反动的法西斯的政策，对外侵略美国以外的全世界，对内压迫本国人民。他们不顾波茨坦公告、开罗宣言、联合国宪章及其他正义协定的约束。任意地破坏联合国宪章。组织侵略性的北大西洋联盟。阴谋重新武装西德和日本。拒绝裁减军备，拒绝废除原子武器。利用蒋介石侵略中国，而在蒋介石失败之后，无理拒绝中华人民共和国的合法代表参加联合国。今年六月又发动了朝鲜战争，同时侵略我国的台湾，轰炸我国的东北。杜鲁门之流之所以敢于横行无忌，是他们自以为有不可抗的军事和经济力量，可以打遍天下无敌手。但是，半年来的朝鲜战争，铁一般的事实向全世界说明了一个完全与此相反的真理：拥有海空军绝对优势，以及陆军装备上绝对优势的美帝国主义的军队，又加上了许多仆从国家的所谓“联合国军队”，在已经觉醒起来的朝鲜人民面前，特别在已经站起来了的中国人民面前，是那样的渺小，那样的脆弱，他们不但是可能被击败的，而是已经被击败了。事实上，在朝鲜战场上，对于帝国主义阵营来说，他们已经集合了目前可能集合的力量，对于和平民主阵营来说，在朝鲜的力量只是我们的力量的很小的部分。
    不过，在胡佛演说以前，美国统治集团，还不肯公开承认这一事实，还想虚声恫吓世界人民。所以在五届联合国大会上，美国还拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，还拒绝撤退在台湾的侵略军，还坚不同意中华人民共和国合法代表进入联合国。此外，还表示将要使用原子弹，还不惜更进一步地组织所谓“西欧联军”，以图继续进行军事恫吓。但是，美国统治阶级的另外一部分人，却看到杜鲁门这种冒险政策，将给他们带来更大的灾难。他们沉不住气了，于是发出了公开的叫喊。胡佛的演说，正是美国统治阶级中一部分人在惊惶失措之余第一次公开的叫喊。他们不得不说出他们绝对不愿意说出的一句话——社会主义的苏联和人民民主的中国，已经是不可能战胜的了。
    由于胡佛的演说，美国统治阶级间的混乱和争吵更加尖锐了。美国杜鲁门政府从来是以“两党一致”的外交政策相标榜的。侵朝战争的失败，以及在五届联大上外交战线上的失败，使美国统治阶级间对于如何进行侵略的方法上，发生了日益明显的分歧。杜鲁门曾经企图掩盖这种分歧的局面，以稳定自己的人心。本月十九日，即在十六日杜鲁门宣布美国已处于“紧急状态”之后第三日，杜鲁门曾经宣布：“对于美国的外交政策”，美国统治阶级领导集团中“并没有人提出异议”。就在第二天，胡佛的“异议”就出来了。而且，胡佛的演说，并不仅代表胡佛个人的意见，美国国会中大部分共和党议员和许多有代表性的反动报纸都站在胡佛这一边。有些人反对胡佛的政策，认为这等于“放弃”欧洲和亚洲大陆，无异承认美国的失败。另外一些人则说：“如果国会支持这个方案，……不但可以节省百十亿美元，而且可以拯救在杜鲁门——艾奇逊——艾森豪威尔方案下注定要遭受无益牺牲的一百万美国男儿的生命。”（芝加哥每日论坛报）为了辩护自己反动透顶的外交政策，防止美国反动统治集团的分裂，十月十九日杜鲁门的声明中，曾经十分强调艾奇逊的反动本质以争取美国统治阶级的合作。他说：“如果共产主义统治了全世界”，“艾奇逊纵然不是第一个……被枪毙的人，也必然是第一批里面的一个。”（美国新闻处华盛顿十九日电）但是杜鲁门的声明，并没有阻止与艾奇逊同样反动的胡佛的“异议”。在胡佛演说后的第二天，杜鲁门没有办法地呼吁美国统治阶级的“团结”，而实际上，混乱与争吵是进一步发展了。
    胡佛的演说，不仅使美国统治阶级“大吃一惊”（合众社），在本来就离心离德的所谓“北大西洋公约”的各国中，引起了更大的沮丧。对于美国的仆从国家，胡佛在痛斥他们在朝鲜作战不努力，以及在西欧备战也不努力之后，完全摆出“主人”的身份，高视阔步，表示有权任意处决他们的命运，所谓“大英帝国”，就已被胡佛划为美国大西洋上的“边疆”！毫无疑问，这将大大增加美帝国主义与其西欧仆从们原有的矛盾。而所谓艾森豪威尔的“西欧联军”的组织将更加困难。
    美帝国主义的阵营，日益混乱和分裂了。全中国正在日益高涨的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动，应当继续坚持与扩大下去，朝鲜前线的人民志愿军应当更英勇地前进，更坚决地打击敌人，使胜利更迅速地到来。
