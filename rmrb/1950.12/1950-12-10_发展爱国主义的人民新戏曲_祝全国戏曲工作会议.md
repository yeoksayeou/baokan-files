The "National Opera Conference" convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on November 27th. More than 200 delegates attended the conference, including cadres from the central and local governments who are leading the opera reform work, some writers and representatives from the drama and music circles, as well as many famous artists from Peking Opera, local operas, and ballad singing circles.

This conference can be said to be unprecedented in terms of its content, the composition of participants, and its scale. It was convened under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct policy of literature and art serving the people; it was convened after the establishment of New China for a year, when revolutionary literature and art have been greatly promoted throughout the country, and various operas have been performing the great tasks of the motherland; it was convened on the basis of a profound connection between the People's Government and the broad opera circles, further cooperation between new literary and art workers and the opera circles, and the opera circles themselves have criticized the past "sectarianism" and begun to organize in unity, especially in the current upsurge of the Chinese people resisting America and aiding Korea, so this conference is full of political atmosphere, seriousness, and fighting spirit. At the beginning of the conference, many artists proposed to widely mobilize the national opera circles to launch a movement to resist America and aid Korea in order to defend the people's new life and defend their motherland, which was immediately warmly responded to. We believe that this high sense of responsibility to the motherland will be quickly reflected in the actual actions of the 350,000 professional opera artists across the country, and through their day and night hard performances, it will make the Chinese people's upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the family, and defending the country penetrate more deeply into every corner and into the depths of every Chinese people's mind, thus generating a greater mobilizing and organizing material force. Therefore, this conference is a conference that fully promotes the noble qualities of patriotism, and this patriotic spirit is the soul of the opera reform work. Without unlimited loyalty to the motherland, we cannot truly respect the brilliant cultural and artistic achievements created by the people over thousands of years with their high wisdom and hard work, and truly cherish and preserve the broad artists of these cultural and artistic heritages.

The National Opera Conference will enable Chairman Mao's policy of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" to be universally and deeply implemented throughout the country, and the opera reform work will enter a new upsurge. In order to express our congratulations and love for the conference, I would also like to contribute some superficial opinions on how to further develop the patriotic people's opera in the future, for the reference of opera workers.

Various old operas and ballads all come from the people, are created by the people, and are beloved by the broad masses of the people. They have a deep foundation among the masses, they are the wealth of the people, the wealth of the country, and a rich heritage in the old literature and art. Today, the people have become the masters of the country and are the only legitimate inheritors of the national cultural and artistic heritage. We have the right and the obligation to develop the excellent traditions in the opera heritage, "weed through the old to bring forth the new," and create new people's operas to exert the great role of educating the broad masses of the people.

Various old operas and ballads are literature and art created by the people under the long-term oppression of feudal rulers, so it is impossible for them to fully express the lives of the people and to smoothly convey the thoughts and feelings of the people. Moreover, because feudal rulers stole this cultural fruit created by the people's genius and took it for themselves, shamelessly distorting it and arrogantly instilling many toxins that deceive the people, a large number of old operas became spokespersons for the feudal rulers and tools for deceiving and enslaving the people. They spread feudal morality, servile ideas, and all superstitious, backward, pornographic, low-level, terrifying, and barbaric things. Despicable feudal exploiters attempted to use these poisonous things to restrain the people's rebellious thoughts, corrode the people's progressive consciousness, and suppress the people's revolutionary actions, so that the working people would be their docile slaves for generations. The history reflected in the old operas is often reversed history, and the characters depicted are often distorted characters. This is an important aspect of the ideology of the old operas, which should be negated or reformed. Therefore, our respect for the heritage is certainly not an uncritical and complete acceptance, but a reform, disinfection, and the return of the historical stage to the people.

However, we must never ignore the democratic ideological components with educational significance for the people contained in the old operas because the old operas have strong feudal toxins. A few people have taken the current standards to measure the rights and wrongs of ancient figures without starting from the historical reality and the specific conditions at that time. They believe that Yue Fei's loyalty to the country was to protect the world for the feudal emperor, Zhuge Liang was a lackey of the ruling class, and his wisdom was to serve the ruling class and was not worthy of praise; the positive figures on Liangshanbo were all individual heroes with bad components and should be criticized. They even believe that Bao Gong was also a bureaucrat, and his private visits in disguise to eliminate harm for the people were not worth taking, etc. This would regard the history of the Chinese nation as a completely dark and muddled account, and regard the old operas as a useless garbage bin. They obliterate the excellent qualities of bravery and hard work inherent in our great nation, obliterate the revolutionary will of our ancestors to oppose the rulers and the sense of justice to sympathize with the oppressed, and obliterate the positive factors in a large number of old operas that are beneficial to the people, and regard them as rotten things that are only technically borrowed and have no merit in content. People with this wrong view will inevitably adopt incorrect attitudes and methods towards the old operas in the work of reforming the operas. Some people advocate banning performances in order to prevent the old dramas from poisoning the masses; some people are eager to write new operas, attempting to completely replace the old operas; some people do not pay attention to research and study of the old operas, but simply use this form that the masses like without developing and improving it. In particular, some playwrights, due to a lack of a historical materialist viewpoint and a lack of appropriate evaluation of positive figures in history, one-sidedly and mechanically emphasize the educational significance of historical facts to contemporary people, attempting to express today's policies and ideas in historical dramas. Therefore, when compiling new operas and revising operas, they often idealize historical figures, and arbitrarily move thoughts and actions that could not have occurred in history to historical figures, that is, to express the thoughts of modern revolutionary figures "through" the actions of ancient figures. They write Li Zicheng's peasant armed forces as the current People's Liberation Army, Yue Fei's army as a model of supporting the government and loving the people, Song Jiang's "loyalty" as a revolutionary leader with a high degree of democratic style, and the honest officials in history as cadres of the People's Government, and ask the ancient people to say many modern terms. These are all erroneous practices of anti-Marxist-Leninist viewpoints. The important reason for this incorrect description of history and creation methods that violate historical authenticity is the lack of a correct and comprehensive view of history.

The people are the creators of history. The history of China's thousands of years of feudal society is the history of the struggle of the broad masses of the Chinese people against oppressors. In the struggle, a brilliant national culture was produced. All old operas were created by the people and grew up under the long-term oppression of feudal society. They have been circulating for thousands of years and are loved by the people. Then it must have another side, a side that can represent the thoughts and feelings of the people, a revolutionary, active, and developing side. This is the side that our opera workers must pay special attention to.

The Chinese nation is a brave and hardworking nation, a nation with a sense of justice and kindness. In feudal society, in order to oppose oppression and fight for democracy, the broad masses of the people carried out a long and cruel struggle with the despots. China's national heroes in the past also showed their loyalty to defend the motherland and their lofty national integrity in the war against foreign invasion. This democratic thought, national consciousness, and sense of justice, as well as all the virtues that human beings have, have been expressed to a certain extent on the historical stage and in the operas created by the people themselves through tortuous paths. Although this expression is scattered and sometimes extremely distorted and branded with the fire mark of feudal consciousness, it is still powerful and moving, and has a strong reaction among the broad masses of the people. The characters depicted in the opera who represent this democratic thought and national consciousness, have a high sense of justice, and have good qualities are familiar and loved by the broad masses of the people. The people are grateful for the brave behavior of the great national hero Yue Fei. His "loyalty to the country" has repeatedly struck the fierce invaders. The loyal spirit of Yang Laolinggong hitting the Li Ling monument and Lu Deng committing suicide in Luanfu, which did not succumb to difficulties and repaid the country with death, has moved countless audiences. The heroes on Liangshanbo raised the banner of "acting for heaven" to help the poor and oppose the feudal dynasty and corrupt officials, and persisted in a long-term armed struggle. Revolutionary stories such as the anti-Xuzhou and the Chuang Wang entering Beijing have inspired many oppressed people. The masses especially like Zhang Fei and Li Kui. They are loyal and brave, honest and kind, representing the noble qualities of mankind. The masses respect Bao Gong, Song Shijie, Zhang Guangcai, and Mi Heng, who struck the drum and scolded Cao. The masses admire Zhuge Liang very much, believing that he is a representative figure with a high degree of wisdom in history, and his deeds have spread throughout the vast cities and villages. All these historical facts and outstanding figures that have been praised in the old operas, if viewed from the current perspective, of course have their own errors and shortcomings. At that time, they did represent the interests of the people and the ideological part of the people's progress. They said what the general people wanted to say but did not say, and did what the general people wanted to do but did not do. Their historical records were recited, praised, and developed by the broad masses of the people. Their spirit inspired the people's spirit of fighting bravely and unyieldingly. The Chinese people have been educated and grown up in these moving stories. Opera has made a major contribution in this regard. The Chinese people, who have defeated the despots for thousands of years, defeated the imperialist aggression forces, and established a new country, are worthy of being outstanding descendants of the great Chinese nation. The new Chinese people are also proud of having so many heroic figures in their own nation. If we can well promote these parts that still have educational and inspiring effects on the new Chinese people and widely sing these operas that have been reformed and processed, it will more powerfully inspire the people's national self-esteem and arouse respect and love for the great motherland.

In the old operas, many stories of feudal oppression have also been deeply depicted, sympathizing with those who were sacrificed by the old society. The old operas have their own unique features in exposing the sins within the feudal rulers and satirizing their ugliness. All of this is also of great significance for us to understand history and analyze the essence of class struggle in feudal society.

Therefore, how to fully promote all the positive factors that are beneficial to the people contained in the opera heritage, how to inspire and educate the people to love their own country through the great deeds of defending the country and loving the people in history, the heroic struggles against the oppressing classes and their lackeys, and the noble qualities of the Chinese people's hard work, health, kindness, and simplicity, especially how to use these artistic forms that have been loved and heard by the broad masses of the people to express the lives and struggles of the new Chinese people, to express the new Chinese people's enthusiasm for labor in building the motherland and their heroic spirit in defending the motherland, in order to improve the people's political consciousness and give play to their patriotism, is the great task of the current opera reform work.

In order to realize this task, in order to create the new people's opera and create the new patriotic opera, we must first implement the correct opera reform policy. This is of course the prerequisite for carrying out the work, and the central key to carrying out the opera reform movement lies in the close unity and extensive cooperation between all the cadres responsible for the opera reform work and the 350,000 artists in the opera circles. We must attach importance to the artists in the opera circles, rely on them, learn from them, and sincerely help them progress, and jointly write new operas and revise old operas with them, and promote them to various places through their performance demonstrations, effectively promoting the opera reform work. The experience of opera reform work in various places over the past year fully proves this point.

The idea of ​​despising artists and excluding artists is very wrong. Opera artists should be regarded as the best preservers of the opera heritage. They are also art workers trained by the people. They have good artistic cultivation. They vividly express the historical facts and great figures of the Chinese nation on the stage and return the people's property that has been occupied by the feudal ruling class for thousands of years to the people, which is a very beneficial contribution to the country. Politically speaking, many artists in the opera circles, due to their political status in the old society, were basically also oppressed classes. They were discriminated against and played with in society, and their lives were very unstable, and some were very difficult. Therefore, many artists have a sense of justice and a revolutionary spirit of criticizing the old society. They love the motherland, adhere to national integrity, keep their beards, live in seclusion, and do not perform for the enemy puppets. Some of them are with revolutionary literary and art workers, performing new operas and using artistic weapons to participate in the struggle for national liberation. Many opera circle representatives participating in the conference have had various admirable exemplary behaviors in these aspects. Some artists even sacrificed their lives because of this. Over the past year, the broad masses of artists in the opera circles across the country have been supporters and implementers of the People's Government's opera reform policy. They have worked hard to study, improve their thinking, improve their business, and write and perform about 200 new dramas, which have made good contributions to educating the people. Some famous actors have also personally gone to the streets to carry out propaganda work in order to cooperate with political tasks. At the same time, they have actively participated in various political activities. In purchasing public bonds, charity performances for disaster relief, and soliciting warm clothes, many artists have shown a high degree of patriotism. They have shouldered the burden of being masters of the country. Therefore, we cannot only see some conservative and narrow ideas that artists have been infected with in feudal society, but not see the positive factors that occupy a dominant position in their thinking in the new society. We must also regard artists as cadres of revolutionary work, and improve and transform the thinking of artists, just like educating other cadres, cultivate them and help them, so that artists who have been fooled by feudal rule for thousands of years can obtain the due status and rights in the new society. We should help them overcome the confused thoughts under the deception of the feudal ruling class, strengthen their sense of being masters in the new country, recognize their responsibilities to the people, help them approach revolutionary practice, and learn new literature and art in order to improve their creation and performance, transform old operas into new operas, and "weed through the old to bring forth the new" the opera heritage that has been influenced and distorted by feudal rule, remove the feudal toxins in it, and create more new people's operas - new people's operas that truly represent the excellent traditions of Chinese national art.

    发展爱国主义的人民新戏曲
    ——祝全国戏曲工作会议
    周巍峙
    中央人民政府文化部召集的“全国戏曲工作会议”已于十一月二十七日在北京开幕，参加大会的代表二百余人，包括中央及各地领导戏曲改革工作的干部、一部分作家及戏剧、音乐界的代表，并有许多京剧、地方剧及曲艺界的著名的艺术家。
    这个会无论从会议的内容，参加者成份与规模方面来看，都可以说是空前的大会。它是在毛主席文艺为人民服务的正确方针的指导下召开的，是在新中国建立一年，革命文艺已在全国发扬光大，多种多样的戏曲已在执行祖国各项伟大任务的情况下召开的，是在人民政府与广大戏曲界艺人有了深刻的联系，新文艺工作者与戏曲界有了进一步的合作，而戏曲界本身已在批判过去的“门户之见”而开始组织起来的团结基础上召开的，特别是在目前中国人民抗美援朝的高潮中召开的，因此这个会充满了政治气氛，充满了严肃性与战斗精神。大会一开始就有许多艺人提出为了保卫人民的新生活，保卫自己的祖国，广泛动员全国戏曲界展开抗美援朝宣传运动的号召，而立刻得到热烈的响应。我们相信这种对祖国的高度责任感，一定会迅速的体现在全国三十五万职业戏曲艺人的实际行动里，通过他们日夜辛勤的演唱，将使中国人民抗美援朝，保家卫国的热潮，更能深入到每一个角落，渗透到每一个中国人民的思想深处，从而发生更伟大的动员组织的物质力量。所以这个会是充分发扬爱国主义高贵品质的大会，而这种爱国主义精神正是戏改工作中的灵魂，没有对祖国的无限忠诚，就不会真正尊重人民千百年来用他们高度智慧与辛勤劳动所创造的光辉的文化艺术，真正爱护保存了这些文化艺术的遗产的广大艺人。
    全国戏曲工作会议将使毛主席“推陈出新”的方针，在全国普遍而深刻地加以贯彻执行，戏曲改革工作将进入一个新的高潮。为了表示对大会的庆祝与爱戴，我也就今后如何进一步发展爱国主义的人民戏曲问题，贡献一点粗浅的意见，供戏曲工作者参考。
    各种旧剧及曲艺都是来自民间、由人民创造，并为广大人民所喜爱的艺术形式。它在群众中有深厚的基础，它是人民的财富、国家的财富，是旧文艺中丰富的遗产。今天人民已成为国家的主人，是民族文化艺术遗产唯一合法的继承者。我们有权利，也有义务来发展戏曲遗产中优秀传统，“推陈出新”，创造出新的人民戏曲，以发挥教育广大人民的伟大作用。
    各种旧剧及曲艺是人民在封建统治者长期压迫下创造出来的文艺，因此它不可能充分表现人民的生活，不能畅达人民的思想感情。更由于封建统治者窃夺了这种为人民天才创造的文化果实，据为己有，加以无耻的歪曲，狂妄的灌输进许多欺骗人民的毒素，使大量的旧戏曲成为封建统制者的代言人，成为愚弄和奴役人民的工具。它们传布封建道德，奴才思想，以及一切迷信落后，色情低级与恐怖野蛮的东西。卑鄙的封建剥削者，企图用这些有毒的东西来束缚人民的反抗思想，腐蚀人民的前进意识，镇压人民的革命行动，要劳动人民世世代代，祖祖辈辈都做他们驯服的奴隶。旧的戏曲所反映的历史往往是被颠倒的历史，被描绘的人物常是被歪曲的人物。这是旧戏曲意识形态的重要的一面，应被否定或加改革的一面。所以我们尊重遗产当然不是无批判的全盘接受，而是进行改革，消毒，把历史舞台归还人民。
    但是我们绝不能因为旧戏曲具有浓厚的封建毒素，就把旧戏曲中所蕴藏的对人民有教育意义的民主思想成份忽略。曾有少数人不从历史现实与当时的特定条件出发，拿现在的尺度去衡量古代人物的是非。他们认为岳飞的精忠报国是为封建皇帝保天下，诸葛亮是统治阶级的爪牙，他的智慧是为统治阶级服务，不值得赞扬；梁山泊上的正面人物都是成份不好的个人英雄主义者应加批判。甚至认为包公也是官僚，他易服私访为民除害并无可取等等。这样就把中国民族的历史看成是漆黑一团的糊涂账，把旧戏曲看成一无是处的垃圾箱了。他们抹煞了我们伟大民族所固有的那种勇敢勤劳的优良品质，抹煞了我们的祖先们那种反对统治者的革命意志与同情被压迫者的正义感，抹煞了大量旧戏曲中所蕴藏的有利于人民的积极因素，而把它看成是仅仅在技术上有所借镜，内容上毫无可取的朽物。有这种错误看法的人在改革戏曲工作当中必然会对旧戏曲采取不正确的态度与手段。有的人为了防止旧剧贻毒群众，主张禁演；有的人则急于赶写新戏曲，企图完全代替旧戏曲；有的人对旧戏曲并不注意研究与学习，仅仅是单纯的利用这种群众所喜欢的形式，而不加以发展与提高。特别有些编剧的人由于缺乏历史唯物观点，缺乏对历史上正面人物的适当估价，片面的机械的强调历史事实对当代人民的教育意义，企图在历史剧中表现今天的政策思想，因而在编新与修改戏曲时就常常把历史人物理想化，把历史上所不可能产生的思想与行动，都武断地搬用到历史人物身上去，也就是把现代革命人物的思想“通过”古代人物的行动表现出来。他们把李自成的农民武装写成现在的人民解放军，把岳飞的军队写成是拥政爱民的模范，把宋江的“义气”写成具有高度民主作风的革命领袖，把历史上的清官写成人民政府的干部，叫古代人民说出许多现代的名词，这都是反马列主义观点的错误做法。产生这种不正确的描写历史，违反历史真实性的创作方法的重要原因，就是对于历史缺乏正确的全面的看法。
    人民是历史的创造者，中国数千年的封建社会的历史是中国广大人民反对压迫者的斗争史，在斗争中产生了光辉的民族文化。一切旧的戏曲既为人民创造，又是在封建社会长期压迫下成长起来的，流传了千百年，为人民热爱的艺术，那末它必然会有另外的一面，能够代表人民思想感情的一面，革命的积极的应加发扬的一面，这是我们戏曲工作者必须特别加以注意的一面。
    中国民族是勇敢勤劳的民族，是具有正义感与善良性格的民族，在封建社会里，广大人民为了反对压迫，争取民主，曾和专制主义者进行了长期而残酷的斗争，中国历代的民族英雄们在反对外族侵略的战争中也表现了他们捍卫祖国的忠诚与崇高的民族气节，这种民主思想、民族意识与正义感，以及一切人类所具有的美德，经过迂回曲折的道路在历史的舞台上，在人民亲手创造的戏曲中得到了一定的表现，这种表现虽然是分散的，有时是极歪曲，被烙上封建意识的火印，但仍旧是有力的，动人的，在广大人民中有着强烈的反应。而在戏曲中描绘的代表这种民主思想与民族意识，具有高度正义感，有着善良品格的人物，则为广大人民所熟悉、所热爱。人民感激伟大的民族英雄岳飞的勇敢行为，他“精忠报国”无数次的打击凶恶侵略者。杨老令公碰死李陵碑上，陆登自刎于潞安府内的那种临难不屈、以死报国的忠贞精神，曾感动过无数的观众。梁山泊上的英雄打起“替天行道”的大旗，援助贫苦群众，反对封建皇朝，反对贪官污吏，坚持了长期的武装斗争。反徐州，闯王进京一类革命故事是鼓舞了许多被压迫的人民。群众特别喜欢张飞与李逵，他们忠诚而又勇敢，憨直而又善良，代表了人类高尚的品格。群众尊敬包公，尊敬宋士杰，张广才，尊敬击鼓骂曹的弥衡这一派人物。群众十分钦佩诸葛亮，认为他是历史上具有高度智慧的代表人物，他的事迹传遍了广大的城市乡村。这一切在旧的戏曲中曾被歌颂过的历史事实与优秀人物，如果从现在的角度来看，当然自有其错误与缺点，在当时确实是代表了人民的利益，代表人民前进的思想部分，他们说了一般人民想说而未说出的话，做了一般人民想做而未做出的事，他们的史迹为广大人民所传诵、赞扬与发展，他们的精神，鼓舞了人民前仆后继顽强不屈的斗争精神。中国人民就在这些动人的故事当中受到教育，成长起来。戏曲在这方面有着重大的贡献。战胜了数千年来的专制主义者，打垮了帝国主义侵略势力，建立起新国家的中国人民，不愧为伟大的中国民族的优秀子孙，新中国人民也因为自己民族有过这么多的英雄人物而感到骄傲，我们如能很好的发扬这些对新中国人民仍有教育与鼓舞作用的部分，广泛的演唱这些经过改革与加工的戏曲，它将更有力的启发人民的民族自尊心，引起对伟大祖国的尊敬与热爱。
    在旧的戏曲中也深刻的描绘过许多封建压迫故事，同情那些被旧社会牺牲的人物，在揭露封建统治者内部的罪恶，讽刺他们的丑恶方面，旧剧更有其独到之处。这一切对于我们认识历史，分析封建社会阶级斗争的本质等方面也都有重大的意义。
    因此如何使戏曲遗产中所蕴藏的对人民有益的一切积极因素得到充分发扬，如何通过历史上那些卫国爱民的伟大事迹，那些反抗压迫阶级及其爪牙的英勇斗争，以及中国人民的勤劳、健康、善良、朴素的崇高品质来启发和教育人民热爱自己的国家，尤其是如何运用这些已为广大群众所喜见乐闻的艺术形式，表现新中国人民的生活与斗争，表现新中国人民在建设祖国的劳动热忱与保卫祖国的英雄气概，以提高人民的政治觉悟，发挥其爱国主义精神，这是当前戏改工作的伟大任务。
    为了实现这一任务，为了创造人民的新戏曲，创造爱国主义的新戏曲，首先必须贯彻正确的戏改方针，这当然是开展工作的前提，而开展戏改运动的中心关键则在于一切负责戏改工作的干部与戏曲界三十五万艺人的亲密的团结，广泛的合作。我们必须重视戏曲界艺术家，依靠他们，向他们学习，而又诚恳的帮助他们进步，和他们共同来编写新戏曲、修改旧戏曲，并经过他们的演出示范，传布各地，有效的推进戏曲改革工作。一年来各地戏改工作的经验充分证明这一点。
    轻视艺人，排斥艺人的思想是十分错误的。应该把戏曲艺人看成是戏曲遗产的最好的保存者。他们也是由人民培养起来的艺术工作者，他们有很好的艺术修养，他们生动地在舞台上表现中国民族的历史事实与伟大人物，将千百年来被封建统治阶级所霸占了的人民财产，交还给人民，这对于国家是一种十分有益的贡献。从政治上来说，许多戏曲界艺人由于过去在旧社会所处政治地位，基本上也是被压迫阶级，他们在社会上受歧视，受玩弄，生活很不稳定，有的十分困难。因此不少艺人是具有正义感，具有批判旧社会的革命精神。他们热爱祖国，坚守民族气节，留须、隐居，不为敌伪演戏，有的和革命文艺工作者在一起，演出新戏曲，用艺术武器，参加争取民族解放。参加大会的不少戏曲界代表就在这些方面有过种种令人钦佩的模范行为。有一些艺人还因而牺牲性命。一年以来，全国广大戏曲界艺人是人民政府戏改政策的支持者与执行者。他们在工作中努力学习，提高自己思想，改进业务，编写与演了二百出左右的新剧，对教育人民方面有了很好的贡献，有的名角们为了配合政治任务，还亲自走上街头进行宣传工作。同时，并积极参加各种政治活动，在购买公债，义演赈灾，劝募寒衣等等方面，很多艺人都表现了高度的爱国主义精神，他们已担负起国家主人翁的担子。因此我们不能只看见艺人在封建社会所沾染来的一些保守狭隘的思想，而看不到在新社会里他们思想当中占主要地位的积极因素。我们要把艺人也看作革命工作的干部，把提高与改造艺人思想，像教育其他干部一样，培养他们，帮助他们，使千百年来被封建统治所愚弄的艺术家在新社会中获得应有的地位与权利。应该帮助他们克服在封建统治阶级的蒙蔽下的糊涂思想，加强他们在新国家中的主人翁思想，认清自己对人民所负的责任，帮助他们接近革命实际，学习新文艺，以提高他们的创作与表演，变旧戏曲为新戏曲，把为封建统治所影响和歪曲了的戏曲遗产“推陈出新”，清除掉其中的封建毒素，创造出更多的新的人民戏曲——真正代表中国民族艺术优秀传统的新的人民戏曲。
