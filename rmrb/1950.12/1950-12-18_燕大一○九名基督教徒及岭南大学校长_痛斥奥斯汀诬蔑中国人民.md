    109 Christian Believers from Yenching University and the President of Lingnan University
    Denounce Austin for Slandering the Chinese People

    [Our Newspaper] One hundred and nine Christian believers from the private Yenching University in Beijing, including Fang Kuangyu, Cai Yongchun, Chen Yongling, Wang Hanzhang, Lin Handa, Cai Huang Xiuying, Sun Youyun, Fan Yihua, Yang Anfeng, Zhang Jin, Zhang Xuehai, Luo Huiquan, and Tu Zhou Huiqin, jointly issued a statement refuting Austin's shameless lies in the United Nations Security Council. The statement said: At a time when churches in China that have accepted foreign economic assistance are carrying out innovation movements to achieve self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation, Austin's speech distorting the facts makes us more aware of the attempt by American imperialism to use church undertakings as political capital. We believe that the vast majority of the American people and devout Christians have based their missionary, educational, medical, and welfare endeavors in China on love and pure motives, but American imperialism has always tried to use and obstruct them. Therefore, we firmly oppose the American imperialist spokesman Austin's rogue seizure of the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and the fruits of the church's missionary work, to deceive the eyes of the people of the world and obscure the thoughts of the American people. We solemnly warn American imperialism that it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of insulting the Chinese people and the church, and alienating the feelings between the Chinese and American people. As for our friendship with the American people, and the relationship between us as members of the universal body of believers, it will not be damaged by this. We call on Christians across the country and around the world to rise up and sternly refute and oppose the imperialists' use of missionary activities by Christian people's organizations to conceal their political aggression and conspiracies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 15th] Chen Xujing, President of Lingnan University in Guangzhou, and all members of the University Affairs Committee issued a declaration on the 13th, protesting against the slander of the Chinese education community by Austin, the permanent representative of the United States to the Security Council. The declaration began by stating: Austin, the representative of the United States to the United Nations, delivered an absurd speech at the Security Council meeting on November 28, and mentioned Lingnan University, which is an insult and a slander to us! The declaration then pointed out: Although American imperialism has tried its best to use church universities as a cover for cultural aggression, there are currently many intellectuals from church universities who have become heroic anti-imperialist fighters, which shows that the more people suffer from American imperialist aggression, the more determined their resistance will be! The declaration continued: We admit that the friendship between the Chinese and American people is worth cherishing, but those warmongers who are opposed by the American people must not be allowed to falsely claim to represent the American people, and we have only hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialist elements, and there is absolutely no friendship to speak of! Therefore, we lodge a solemn protest against Austin's slander! The declaration finally called on all teachers, students, and staff to resolutely resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, as a response to the enemy's insults and slanders.

    燕大一○九名基督教徒及岭南大学校长            
    痛斥奥斯汀诬蔑中国人民
    【本报讯】北京私立燕京大学基督教徒方贶予、蔡咏春、陈永龄、王汉章、林汉达、蔡黄秀英、孙幼云、范翼华、杨安峰、张瑾、张学海、罗汇泉、屠周惠琴等一百零九人为驳斥奥斯汀在联合国安理会上的无耻谰言，特联合发表声明。声明中称：中国教会中接受外国经济扶助的教会正在进行革新运动，实现自立、自养、自传的时候，奥斯汀歪曲事实的演说，使我们更认清了美帝国主义利用教会事业作为政治资本的企图。我们认为美国广大人民及虔诚的基督徒对在中国进行传教、教育、医药、福利等事业，是基于爱心和纯良动机，美帝国主义却一向设法利用和阻挠。所以我们坚决反对美帝国主义代言人奥斯汀无赖地窃取了中美人民的友谊，和教会传教事业的果实，来蒙蔽全世界人民的眼目，模糊美国人民的思想。我们郑重地警告美帝国主义，对侮辱中国人民和教会，离间中美人民感情的一切后果，应负完全责任。至于我们与美国人民的友谊，以及与普世信徒间互为肢体的关系是不会因此而受到损害的。我们号召全国以及全世界的基督徒起来对帝国主义利用基督徒人民团体的传教事业掩饰进行他们的政治侵略和阴谋，加以严正的驳斥和反对。
    【新华社广州十五日电】广州市岭南大学校长陈序经及该校校务委员会全体委员于十三日发表宣言，抗议美国驻安理会常任代表奥斯汀对于中国教育界的诬蔑。宣言首称：美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀十一月二十八日在安理会的会议席上，发表了一篇荒谬绝伦的演说，并提到了岭南大学，这对我们是一种侮辱，是一种诽谤！宣言接着指出：美帝国主义虽曾千方百计利用教会大学做掩蔽，进行文化侵略，但目前恰有不少教会大学出身的知识分子，成为英勇的反帝战士，这说明了身受美帝侵略愈甚的人们，其反抗也愈为坚决！宣言继称：我们承认中美人民友谊是值得珍视的，但那些被美国人民反对的战争贩子们，决不容其冒称美国人民，而我们对于美帝国主义分子，只有仇视、鄙视和蔑视，绝无友谊之可言！因此，我们对奥斯汀的诬蔑提出严正的抗议！宣言最后号召全体师生员工坚决抗美援朝、保家卫国，以此答复敌人的侮辱和诽谤。
