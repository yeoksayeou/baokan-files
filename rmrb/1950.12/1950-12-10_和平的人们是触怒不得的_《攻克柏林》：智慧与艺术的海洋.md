    Peace-loving people are not to be trifled with
    -- "The Fall of Berlin": An Ocean of Wisdom and Art 		Zhong Dianfei
    -- Have you seen "The Fall of Berlin"?
    -- I've seen it, I saw it on the 7th (October Revolution Day).
    In recent months, workers, students, and citizens in the capital have been spreading the word about "The Fall of Berlin," considering its showing a major event in our political and cultural life.
    For more than a year, the Chinese people have gradually broken free from the American and British films laced with arsenic and chloroform, as well as some negative films from the Kuomintang era, and have changed their tastes and preferences. It is no accident that "The Fall of Berlin" has attracted 280,000 viewers in the capital in a month. With the awakening of millions of people, the need for new spiritual food is rapidly increasing. And Soviet films and new Chinese films after liberation artistically present us with new ideals, new characters, sentiments, morals, and ethics.
    I would like to start by discussing how "The Fall of Berlin" profoundly and movingly presents the lessons of history.
    You may recall: A kind and honest steelworker, Alyosha, is wounded by a German plane in a wheat field. He is lying in bed when Zileguo (the soldier who sings so well, later lies down on the steps of the Reichstag in Berlin, and pulls a bloody handkerchief from his chest) comes to see him, planning to take him to the rear to arrange production. Alyosha remembers what Zileguo just told him: "The Germans are under Moscow," "Stalin is in Moscow," his lover "Natasha has been captured by the Germans," "The Germans have hanged the children from Natasha's school!" He then roars:
    "Go to production... Natasha is suffering in Germany, the Germans have reached Moscow... Now my production is to create German corpses!"
    The man who said this was recently silently guarding the open-hearth furnace. Because of his selfless labor, he created a new record of producing one ton of steel per square meter. "Truth Daily" published his news, the Soviet government awarded him the Red Banner Medal, and Stalin asked him to Moscow to talk. This hero from the open-hearth furnace, except as he himself said, "When the steel is refined, you look at it like this... At this time, you forget even your parents... You want to sing loudly, regardless of any sound, just like a nightingale." But in front of Natasha and Stalin, he is a very clumsy fellow. When he entered the Kremlin, he even wanted to run away. He said to the person leading the way: "To be honest, I can't do it. Let me go back! What do I do? Salute him? You should find our factory director!" Just as when he first met Natasha and took her home, Natasha said to him: "Why don't you come in and sit for a while?" He could only answer simply: "No, it's too late!" When he took out a music ticket and said to Natasha: "Natasha, would you like to go to a concert tomorrow? I have two tickets here!" Natasha said: "Thank you. Of course, I will go, you can pick me up then." And Alyosha, what did he say? He said: "You should go by yourself, I will wait for you there."
    What a kind person! He pursues new records in steel production and Natasha's pure love. And he knows that this steel will be used for the construction of the motherland, and Natasha will bring him a happy life. However, German planes destroyed his steel plant, Natasha was captured by the Germans, and her life and death are unknown. And another great and amiable person, just like him, is in the besieged city of Moscow. Therefore, when we see Alyosha again in the film, he is standing fully armed in Red Square, inspected by Stalin; he appears again in the trenches, and rushes out of the trenches with Stalin's voice. Later, as he advanced with the army, he passed by his home - a pile of ruins. He lay on a pile of broken bricks and cried bitterly, crying for his mother. Yusupov, standing next to him, was talking to a captured German officer -
    Yusupov: You bastard, this is not war, you kill women and children, you bastard!
    German officer: I am not a bastard. I am a German officer, the history of the Germans is Germany, and it is always advancing; the Soviet Union's is retreating!
    Alyosha opened his teary eyes and asked, "Who said this?" The German officer replied, "Adolf Hitler. My Führer." Alyosha could not contain his burning anger, and strode forward to ask him -
    Alyosha: Where are you from?
    German officer: Berlin, Fried Street (site of the Hitler's German Reichstag).
    Alyosha: Good. When I get to your Fried Street, I will chop your house into mincemeat! You know?
    German officer: You will never reach Berlin.
    Alyosha: ………… Your Berlin will only be a pile of dirt. Don't say I'm cruel then. I didn't invade anyone, and I didn't invade you. I am kind. …
    In this way, Alyosha finally arrived in Berlin and, together with two other comrades, raised the first Soviet flag on the German Reichstag on Fried Street.
    This "Fall of Berlin" plan, I think it should be said, was first drafted by Hitler himself. We still remember when the war began, Hitler arrogantly declared in the Imperial Conference Hall in front of his ministers and some pro-German ministers: "I want to turn the clock of history forward a hundred years. Communism will be eliminated by us forever!" "My spoils of victory are to draw the German border to the Urals." "The Russian army is gone, I have eliminated them!" "I order to take Moscow on November 7th!" These beautiful words, if Hitler were alive today as the victor, would definitely be edged with gold. But he died with the wolfhound. He thought the Russians would never reach Berlin, because they were kind. "Blitzkrieg" (this was the most beautiful word in 1941, which was even better than "atomic bomb," the most beautiful word in 1945!), swept Europe. How could the Russians resist? But he did not expect that a shy person like Alyosha, once he gets angry, nothing can stop him. There is a Chinese proverb: "People are afraid of being heartbroken, trees are afraid of being skinned." In the Peking opera "Wild Boar Forest," Lin Chong also said two similar words after revenge - "A man does not shed tears easily, only when he is heartbroken." Truth, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, tells us: peace-loving and kind people are not to be trifled with. Even if the aggressors use tricks and succeed temporarily, once the people are determined to retaliate, they will be merciless! The fate of the aggressor is worse than he imagined! There are thousands of Alyoshas in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They used to farm in the mountains and valleys, and graze cattle and sheep on the grasslands. They never dreamed of Nanjing, Chongqing, or Chengdu, but when the enemies from Nanjing, Chongqing, and Chengdu invaded them, didn't they arrive in Nanjing, Chongqing, and Chengdu as victors?
    Is there anyone in the world more kind than communists? They sacrifice everything they have, just to exchange for the equality and happiness of all mankind. And the aggressors actually think that this kind of person can be deceived, not enough to intimidate, and even dare to use force. "The Fall of Berlin" is a record of the end of a culprit who openly used force against peace-loving people, and there will be a worse end waiting for the second reckless person who dares to use force against peace-loving people! Don't you see that the person who was standing on the Yalu River not long ago and acting fiercely to the north is now "advancing south" (United Press Tokyo, 2nd dispatch)!

    和平的人们是触怒不得的
    ——《攻克柏林》：智慧与艺术的海洋			钟惦棐
    ——你看过《攻克柏林》了么？
    ——看过了，我七号（十月革命节）便看了。
    近月来，首都的工人、学生、市民们奔走相告，把《攻克柏林》的上演，认为这是我们政治与文化生活中一桩重大的事情。
    一年多来，中国人民逐渐从含有砒霜与柯罗彷的美英影片及国民党统治时代的一部分消极影片中摆脱出来，改变了自己的爱好和趣味。《攻克柏林》在首都上演一月以来，拥有二十八万观众，这不是偶然的事。随着千百万人民的觉醒，对新的精神食粮的需要急速增加。而苏联影片和解放后的中国新影片，恰好是对我们艺术地展示了新的理想、新的性格、情操、道德与伦理。
    这里想先说说《攻克柏林》是怎样深刻而动人地提示了历史的教训。
    你还可以记得：一个善良忠厚的炼钢工人阿略沙，在麦田里被德国飞机炸伤了。他正躺在床上，厂里的工人翟勒果（就是那个很会唱歌，后来在柏林国会大厦阶前躺下，从怀里掏出血手帕的战士）来看他，打算接他到后方安排生产去。阿略沙记起了翟勒果刚才告诉他的话：“德国人在莫斯科城下”，“斯大林在莫斯科”，他的爱人“娜塔沙被抓到德国”，“德国人把娜塔莎学校的孩子都绞死了”！他于是咆哮说：
    “生产去……娜塔莎在德国受罪，德国人到了莫斯科……现在我的生产就是制造德国人的尸首！”
    说这话的人，不久前还默默地守候在马丁炉旁，由于他忘我的劳动，创造了一平方米生产一吨钢的新纪录，《真理报》发表了他的消息，苏联政府授给他红旗奖章，斯大林找他去莫斯科谈话，这位马丁炉旁的英雄，除了像他自己所说的“当钢炼好了的时候，你这么一看哪……这时候连爹妈都忘了……想大声歌唱，不顾一切声音，像夜莺一样地就唱起来。”可是在他在娜塔莎、在斯大林面前，却是一个很笨拙的家伙。进了克里姆林宫，他还想跑。他对领路的人说：“说真的，我不成。让我回去吧！我怎么办呢？给他敬礼吗？你还是找我们的厂长来吧！”恰如当他初次认识娜塔莎并送她回家去的时候，娜塔莎对他说：“你到屋里坐会儿吧？”他只能简单的回答：“不行喽，太晚啦！”及至他又掏出一张音乐票来对娜塔莎说：“我说娜塔莎，明天听音乐去好么？我这里有两张票哪！”娜塔莎说：“谢谢你。我当然要去了，到时候你来接我好了。”而阿略沙，他怎么说呢？他说：“你还是自己去吧，我在那儿等你。”
    多么和善的人呵！他追求着钢铁生产的新纪录，追求着娜塔莎的纯真的爱情。并且他知道这些钢铁将用之于祖国的生产建设，而娜塔莎会带给他美满的生活。可是，德国飞机炸毁了他的炼钢厂，娜塔莎被抓到德国，生死不明。而另一个伟大的和他一样善良可亲的人，正在危城莫斯科。因此当我们在影片上再见阿略沙的时候，他已经全副武装的站立在红场上受斯大林的检阅；再一次出现是在战壕里，并随着斯大林的声音冲出战壕。后来他在军队的前进中走过自己的家——一片败瓦颓垣，他伏在一堆烂砖上痛哭起来，哭他的妈妈。站在他旁边的尤叔甫和一个德国的俘虏军官谈话——
    尤：浑蛋，这不是战争，你们打死女人、小孩，浑蛋！
    德寇：我不是浑蛋。我是德国军官，日尔曼的历史是德国的，永远是前进着；苏联的则是后退的！
    阿略沙睁开泪眼模糊的眼睛，问“这是谁说的？”德寇回答他说：“阿道夫·希特勒。我的元首。”阿略沙止不住怒火燃烧，大步上前去问他——
    阿：你是那里人？
    德寇：柏林，弗里德大街（希特勒德国国会大厦所在地）。
    阿：好的。到了你的弗里德大街，我把你的房子剁成酱！知道吗？
    德寇：你们永远也不会打到柏林。
    阿：…………你的柏林只会剩下一堆土。到那时候也别说我残忍。我没有侵犯别人，我也没有侵犯你。我善良。………
    就这样，阿略沙终于到了柏林，并且和其他两个同志一道，在弗里德大街的德国国会大厦上升起第一面苏联的国旗。
    这个“攻克柏林”的计划，我想应该说最先是由希特勒自己拟定的。我们还记得当战争开始的时候，希特勒在帝国会议厅狂妄地当着他的大臣和一些亲德公使们宣称：“我要把历史的时钟向前拨一百年。共产主义将永远被我们给消灭掉了！”“我的胜利果实是把德国国境划到乌拉尔。”“俄国的军队没有啦，我把它们消灭啦！”“我命令十一月七号拿下莫斯科！”这些动听的话，如果希特勒今天是作为胜利者在活着，一定是要用金子来镶边的。可是他和狼狗一起死掉了。他以为俄国人一定不会打到柏林去的，因为他们善良。“闪击战术”（这是一九四一年最动听的名词，比之一九四五年最动听的名词“原子弹”来，实有过之无不及！），席卷欧洲。俄国人怎么能抵挡得住呢？可是他没有想到像阿略沙这样腼腼腆腆的人，一旦发起怒来，那就是什么东西也抵挡不住的了。中国有句谚语说：“人怕伤心，树怕剥皮。”京剧《野猪林》里，林冲在报仇之后也曾经说过两句与此相似的话——“丈夫有泪不轻弹，只因未到伤心处。”古今中外的真理都告诉我们：爱和平的善良的人们是触怒不得的。即使侵略者会施以小技，暂时得逞，但是人民一旦决心起来报复，就将是无情的！侵略者的命运，比他自己所设想的要糟糕得多！中国人民解放军中有成千成万的阿略沙，他们原在山洼洼里种地，在草原上放牧牛羊，他们从来没有梦想过什么南京、重庆、成都，但当自南京、重庆、成都来的敌人一旦侵犯了他们的时候，他们不是一样以胜利者的身份到了南京、重庆、成都么？
    世界上还有比共产主义者更善良的人么？他们牺牲了自己的一切，无非是要换取一个全人类的平等与幸福。而侵略者们竟以这种人为可欺，恫吓之不足，竟至敢于动武。《攻克柏林》便是记录了一个公然对和平人们动武的罪魁的下场，将还有更坏的下场，在等待着第二个敢于向和平人们动武的冒失鬼哩！君不见不久前还站在鸭绿江边向北逞凶的人，今天却正在“向南挺进”（合众社东京二日电）呵！
