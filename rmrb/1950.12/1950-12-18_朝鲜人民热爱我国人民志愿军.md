    Korean People Love the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    By Our Correspondent Rong'an·Liwen
    The winter in North Korea is very cold, but the relationship between the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is infinitely warm.
    When the news of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army appearing in Korea spread rapidly throughout the mountains and villages of North Korea, the elderly, women with babies strapped to their backs, gathered in groups to repair roads for the troops, and children helped pick up stones when they heard that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army would be passing through their area. Regardless of the risk of enemy air raids, men, women, and children crossed mountains and valleys to visit, vying to shake hands with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, shouting in Korean, "Long live Mao Zedong!" In Cicheng County, not far from the south bank of the Yalu River, residents quickly organized three hundred stretchers and volunteered to support the Volunteer Army upon hearing of their arrival. However, the Volunteer Army politely declined.
    Different languages and customs cannot hinder the exchange of friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Koreans are accustomed to drinking cold water, but the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is accustomed to drinking boiled water. Therefore, they prepared enough boiled water to treat the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Boiling water is a difficult task in Korea. Whether day or night, if the crazy enemy planes discover a wisp of smoke or a spark of light, they will indiscriminately bomb.
    Korean farmers all sleep on warm "ondol" floors, which occupy the entire house, so they must take off their shoes before entering. On those bitterly cold nights, Korean farmers often held the frozen hands of Volunteer Army soldiers and warmly pulled them onto the warm floor to warm up, without waiting for the soldiers to take off their shoes. Once, several Volunteer Army soldiers stayed at the home of old man Jin in Daxingdong. Jin's fourteen-year-old daughter, Jin Shuaiai, was a clever and lively girl. She warmly stayed with the Volunteer Army comrades, playing freely like she was with her brother who had joined the army, naively pointing at the comrades' leather shoes and backpacks, asking questions, and asking the comrades to teach her simple Chinese. The comrades also enthusiastically learned Korean from her, which made her even happier. In the evening, when people returned to the village from the mountain after air raid precautions, six or seven boys and girls were all invited by Jin Shuaiai to her home, surrounding the Volunteer Army uncles, talking, laughing, and playing, learning Chinese and Korean from each other. When the Volunteer Army comrades had to move on and leave them, old man Jin held the soldiers' hands tightly, reluctant to part. Jin Shuaiai rushed to carry the backpacks for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades, and only parted after sending them more than a mile out of the village to a small river. Old man Jin repeatedly instructed, gesturing with his hands. He pushed forward with his hand, swayed it back, pointed back at his door, and made gestures of sleeping and eating. The Volunteer Army comrades understood what old man Jin meant: "Drive away the American robbers, and when you return victoriously, be sure to pass by his house, and he will prepare a place for the comrades to rest and eat."
    Once, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived at Jiashandong after marching over a hundred miles. The elderly, weak, and women left in the village were unable to chop firewood, and their lives were very difficult. The Volunteer Army soldiers immediately disregarded their fatigue and ran to the high mountains to chop firewood for the masses. They carried the firewood back and distributed it to them. The old men and women in the village repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the Volunteer Army and told the soldiers about the disasters inflicted on them by the American robbers. A primary school teacher in Jiashandong, who was over fifty years old, held the hand of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier tightly, with tears in his eyes, and said encouragingly: "In the past, Japan oppressed us, and we were slaves for more than thirty years. Now we are suffering even more cruel devastation from the American imperialists; but we know that there are Stalin and Mao Zedong in the world, and we Koreans are not afraid of anything. Victory must belong to us."
    The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who entered Korea have a common feeling: the Korean elders, like our Chinese elders, love the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as if they were their own children. Once, a wounded Volunteer Army soldier, Zhou Huchen, was transferred from the front line to a remote valley near Deshili. There was a temporary low house in the valley, and the landlady was a Korean woman in her thirties. She originally had a warm little family, but her original house, grain, and nearly ripe rice were all burned down by the American robbers, and she had to move here to live. When she saw the wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier coming, she immediately received him warmly, took out the salted fish and cabbage hidden in the cave, and made a rich dinner for Zhou Huchen. She spoke to the soldier with gestures. She raised her right hand and made a gesture of hitting her nose hard, then pointed to Zhou Huchen's wound, and finally pointed to herself. Her meaning was "Defeat the American robbers, you have contributed, your injury is for us."
    In the Changjin Lake area, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was dividing and encircling the US Marine Corps First Division, a shrapnel injured the right hand of Nie Yinting, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The medic hurriedly bandaged his wound, and he immediately walked to the field hospital. When he arrived at a small mountain village near Changjin Lake, he was so tired and thirsty that his exhausted body could hardly support him. At this time, an old man warmly led him into his home, asked his wife on the "ondol" to sit up, and carefully helped him lie on the warm floor. Overly exhausted, Nie Yinting quickly fell asleep. After a while, the touch of something woke him up, and he found the old woman standing beside him with a bowl of steaming sorghum rice, kindly asking him to eat. The old couple's kindness deeply moved Nie Yinting. When he was about to leave, the old couple insisted on keeping him for a few more days.
    In order to defeat the common enemy - American imperialism, the Chinese and Korean people have established the closest friendship in arduous and heroic struggles, and are now more closely united and advancing by leaps and bounds on the road to final victory.

    朝鲜人民热爱我国人民志愿军
    本报记者  荣安·力文
    北朝鲜的冬季是很冷的，但朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿部队之间却表现了无限的温暖。
    当我国人民志愿军出现在朝鲜的时候，这一消息迅速地传遍了朝鲜北部的山岭和村镇。人们听说我人民志愿军要从他们那里通过了，老年人，背上缚着婴儿的妇女们，成群结队地为部队抢修公路，孩子们也帮着拾石子。男女老幼冒着敌机的夜袭，翻山越岭，赶来看望，争着向我人民志愿军握手，用朝鲜话欢呼：“万岁！毛泽东！”在鸭绿江南岸不远的慈城郡（县），居民们听说我人民志愿军过江来时，很快就组织了三百付担架，自动支援志愿军。但是，志愿军婉言谢绝了。
    不同的语言和习惯不能阻碍中朝人民友情的交流。朝鲜人是习惯喝冷水的，但是中国人民志愿部队是习惯于喝开水的。于是他们却准备了足够的开水招待我人民志愿军。煮开水在朝鲜是一件困难的事情。无论在白天或夜晚，疯狂的敌机如果发现一缕炊烟、一点火光，便要滥肆轰炸。
    朝鲜农民都睡暖炕，暖炕占了整个房子，因此，进屋必先脱鞋。在那寒风凛冽的夜里，朝鲜农民常常握着志愿军战士冰冻的手，不等志愿军战士脱鞋，就亲热地拉着战士们到炕上取暖。一次有几位志愿军战士住在大兴洞金老汉的家里。金老汉的十四岁的小女儿金淑爱，是个聪明活泼的小姑娘，她亲热地和志愿军同志们在一起，像见到她参军去的哥哥一样无拘束地玩着，天真地指着，同志们的皮鞋、背包，问长问短，让同志们教给她简单的中国话，同志们也热心的向她学习朝鲜话。这使她更高兴了。到夜晚，人们从山上防空回村，六七个男女小孩，全被金淑爱邀到家里，围着志愿军叔叔说笑玩耍，相互学习着中国话和朝鲜话。志愿军同志要继续前进，离开他们了，金老汉紧握着战士们的手，恋恋不舍。金淑爱抢着替我人民志愿军同志背背包，一直送过村外一里多的一条小河才分手。金老汉还一再嘱咐着，用手比划着。他用手向前一推，往回一摆，回头指一指自己的家门，双手作着睡觉、吃饭的姿势。志愿军同志们懂得金老汉的意思，那是说：“把美国强盗打跑，胜利归来时，一定要路过他家，他为同志们准备好休息和吃饭的地方。”
    我人民志愿军某部某次经过百余里行军到达了佳山洞。留在村子里的老弱妇女，无力砍柴，生活非常艰苦。志愿军的战士们立即不顾疲劳，跑到高山上为群众砍柴。并把柴背回来分给他们，村子里的老大爷老大娘们都向志愿军一再表示感谢，并向志愿军的战士们诉说美国强盗加给他们的灾祸。佳山洞一个五十多岁的小学教员，紧紧握着我人民志愿军战士的手，眼含着热泪，激励地说：“过去日本欺压我们，我们当了三十多年的奴隶，现在又遭到美帝更残酷的摧残；但是，我们知道世界上有了斯大林和毛泽东，我们朝鲜人什么都不怕了，胜利一定是属于我们的。”
    进入朝鲜的我国人民志愿军的战士们，有着一个普遍的感觉，就是：朝鲜父老和我们中国父老一样，像热爱自己的子弟似的，热爱着中国人民志愿军。有一次，志愿军中一位负伤战士周虎臣，从前线被转运到德实里附近一个荒僻的山谷中。山谷中有一座临时构成的矮房子，房东是一个三十多岁的朝鲜妇女。她原来有一个温暖的小家庭，但是她原有的房子、粮食和快要成熟的稻禾，都被美国强盗烧毁了，不得不迁移到这里来住。当她看见来了受伤的我国人民志愿军战士的时候，她立即殷勤地接待，取出洞里藏着的咸鱼和白菜，给周虎臣作了一顿丰美的晚餐。她用手势和战士说话。她抬起右手比了一比鼻子，作一个狠狠地打击的样式，又用手指指周虎臣的伤口，最后又用手指指自己。她的意思是“打败美国强盗，你们有功，你的伤，是为了我们。”
    在长津湖一带，我国人民志愿军分割包围着美军陆战队第一师时，一颗弹片炸伤了我人民志愿军战士聂英亭的右手，卫生员急忙替他绑扎好伤口，他即徒步走向兵站医院。当他到达长津湖附近的一个小山村时，又累又渴，疲备的身体几乎支持不住了。这时，便有一位老汉把他亲热地引进家里，让炕上的妻子坐起来，小心地扶持他躺在暖炕上。过度疲困的聂英亭很快就睡熟了。不一会，一种什么东西的触动，惊醒了他，他发现老婆婆正端着一碗热腾腾的高粱米饭，慈祥地站在他的身旁，亲切地让他用饭。老夫妇的这番盛意，深深地感动着聂英亭，当他要离开时，老夫妇还执意留他再休息几天。
    为着战胜共同的敌人——美帝国主义，中朝人民在艰苦卓绝的斗争中建立了最亲密的友谊，现在是更紧密地团结在一起大踏步向着最后胜利的道路上前进。
