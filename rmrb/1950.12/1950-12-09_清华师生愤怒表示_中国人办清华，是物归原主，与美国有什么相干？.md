Tsinghua Teachers and Students Angrily State:
"Chinese People Run Tsinghua; It's Returning Property to Its Rightful Owner. What Does It Have to Do with the United States?"

    Professor Zhang Mingtao said: "The purpose of the United States in running education in China was to train the Chinese people to accept their 'way of life' and 'way of thinking,' and then 'cooperate' with them to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Chinese people, as a tool for their aggression against China. On the surface, it helps us gain knowledge, but knowledge that serves American imperialism is even worse. American imperialism wants to kill with a borrowed knife, wants to use our knife to kill our own people, but its trick has completely failed. We intellectuals who have been subjected to this kind of education have seen through its scheme, and our knife edge is resolutely turned towards American imperialism." Professor Sheng Chenghua said: "American imperialist cultural aggression has poisoned countless Chinese intellectuals, but even when the United States controlled its running dog Chiang Kai-shek and oppressed the Chinese people most severely, Austin also knew that it was at that time that Professor Wen Yiduo of Tsinghua 'slapped the table and stood up, glared angrily at the Kuomintang's guns, preferring to fall rather than submit.' Even at that time, Professor Zhu Ziqing of Tsinghua 'was seriously ill, preferring to starve to death rather than accept American relief food.' And Austin also knows that among the representatives who are accusing 'American imperialist armed aggression against Taiwan' to the world at Chenggong Lake today are former Tsinghua students." He finally said: "The Chinese people have backbone. Many people who were once liberals or democratic individualists have stood up today in the face of American imperialism. Austin, you wait, 500 million Chinese people will have something to say to you!" Professor Pan Guangdan pointed out: "The United States used the Boxer Indemnity to run Tsinghua University, but the money ended up in the hands of the United States anyway, such as hiring many American professors, buying American books and instruments, and sending Chinese students to study in the United States. Isn't that equivalent to sending money away? We must expose this false kindness of American imperialism." Chen Da, Cao Benxi, Shen Yuan, Wu Zuxiang, and others also expressed opinions refuting American imperialism. The entire membership of the Education Trade Union Committee of the school passed a declaration refuting Austin and firmly supporting Wu Xiuquan's speech, advocating continuing to accuse American imperialism.

    Tsinghua University students also angrily denounced Austin's absurd remarks. When third-year students of the Department of Electrical Engineering first reported in the dining hall at noon on the 3rd the anger and protest felt by all the students in their class about Austin's speech, it aroused shouts from all the students. In the afternoon, various departments and grades held talks and meetings, and posted big-character posters to protest. At a discussion meeting of fourth-year students in the Physics Department, one student said: "Austin's mention of this makes us deepen our hatred for American imperialism. He himself mentioned that American imperialism had trained a group of 'talents' for us, and these 'talents' he referred to are the lackeys of imperialism like Wu Guozhen and Jiang Tingfu." Li Yu, a student in the department, said: "Austin's insult to the Chinese people has aroused great resentment in me. I have decided to sign up for a military cadre school as a response to Austin." Big-character posters in the Departments of History, Electrical Engineering 3, Mechanical Engineering 3, and Mechanical Engineering 4 also unanimously suggested that the student union and the school authorities immediately unite with other insulted schools and send a telegram to the Security Council to protest to Austin.

    清华师生愤怒表示
    “中国人办清华，是物归原主，与美国有什么相干？”
    章名涛教授说：“美国在中国办教育的目的，是想训练中国人民接受他们的‘生活方式’‘思想方法’，然后跟他们‘合作’来扑灭中国人民的革命火焰，作为他们侵略中国的工具。表面上是帮助我们有了知识，实际上为美帝服务的知识是更坏的。美帝想借刀杀人，想借我们的刀子杀自己人，但是他的诡计是完全破产了，我们身受这种教育的知识分子都已洞烛其奸，我们的刀口坚决地掉向美帝。”盛澄华教授说：“美帝文化侵略毒害了无数中国的知识分子，但就在美国控制其走狗蒋介石压迫中国人民最甚的时候，奥斯汀可也知道就在那个时候，清华的闻一多教授曾‘拍案而起，横眉怒对国民党的手枪，宁可倒下去，不愿屈服’，即在那个时候，清华的朱自清教授‘一身病重，宁可饿死，不领美国的救济粮’，而奥斯汀可也知道，今日在成功湖向全世界控诉‘美帝武装侵略台湾’的代表中也就有曾经是我们清华的学生在内。”他最后说：“中国人民是有骨气的，许多曾经是自由主义或民主个人主义的人们，今天在美帝面前都已站立起来。奥斯汀，你等着，五万万中国人民，都会有话要回答你！”潘光旦教授指出：“美帝拿庚子赔款办清华大学，但这笔钱结果还是到了美帝手里，如早期聘请很多美籍教授，买美国图书仪器，派中国学生留美，那样不是等于送钱去？美帝这种假人情我们要拆穿它。”陈达、曹本熹、沈元、吴组缃等也都发表了驳斥美帝的意见。该校教育工会委员会全体会员，通过宣言驳斥奥斯汀，并坚决拥护伍修权发言，主张继续控诉美帝。
    清华大学学生也都纷纷怒斥奥斯汀的谰言，当三日中午电机系三年级学生首先在饭厅里报告了他们全班同学对奥斯汀这次演说所感到的愤怒和抗议时，激起了全体同学的吼声。下午各系级都纷纷举行谈话、集会，出大字报抗议，在物理系四年级同学的讨论会上，一位同学说道：“奥斯汀这样一提，更使我们加深了对美帝的仇恨。他自己提到，美帝曾替我们训练了一批‘人才’，而他所指的这些‘人才’就是吴国桢、蒋廷黻这一小撮帝国主义的奴才。”该系李钰同学说：“奥斯汀这种对中国人民的侮辱，激起了我很大的愤恨，我决定报名参加军事干部学校，作为对奥斯汀的答复。”历史系、电三、机三、机四等系级的大字报上，也一致建议学生会和学校当局马上联合其他被侮辱学校，拍电报给安理会向奥斯汀提出抗议。
