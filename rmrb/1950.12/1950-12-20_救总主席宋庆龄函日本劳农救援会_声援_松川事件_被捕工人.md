    Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Relief Administration, Sends Letter to Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Society
    In Support of Workers Arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident"

To Chairman Fuse Tatsuji of the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Society:

    We learned of the Matsukawa Incident very late and deeply regret not being able to express our support in a timely manner.

    We deeply sympathize with the Japanese people who cannot tolerate the reactionary government's arrogant and brutal treatment of innocent workers and have launched a movement demanding the release of the workers arrested in the Matsukawa Incident. We firmly protest against the repeated persecution of workers by the Japanese reactionary rulers. Today, when the worldwide movement for peace is flourishing in various countries, and American imperialism is waging a war of aggression against Korea, seriously undermining China's peace and security, the atrocities of persecuting progressive working class and massacring the people are being carried out madly in all oppressed countries and among all oppressed people. Their aim is to use this to oppress the people at home and intensify their foreign aggression. We oppose the imperialists' aggression and the persecution inflicted on the Japanese people by the reactionary rulers, and we support your movement demanding the unconditional release of the workers arrested in the Matsukawa Incident. At the same time, your heroic struggle against oppression is not isolated and helpless, but has the working people of China and the world as its backing, and will give you all possible assistance. In the face of the peace-loving and free people of the world, such shameless and heinous atrocities as the Matsukawa Incident will surely be met with resolute resistance from the people. Wishing you victory.

                                Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Chinese People's Relief Administration
                                      December 18, 1950

    救总主席宋庆龄函日本劳农救援会
    声援“松川事件”被捕工人日本劳农救援会布施辰治主席：
    我们获悉松川事件的消息很迟，未能及时予以声援，抱歉殊深。
    日本人民不能容忍反动政府蛮横残暴地对待无辜的工人，发起了要求释放松川事件中被捕工人的运动，我们深感同情。我们对日本反动统治者屡次迫害工人，坚决抗议。当今天全世界人民要求和平的运动正在各国蓬勃发展，而美帝国主义正向朝鲜进行侵略战争，严重地破坏中国和平安全的时候，迫害前进的工人阶级，屠杀人民的暴行，已在各被压迫国家、各被压迫的人民中疯狂地进行着。他们的目的，就是借此来压迫国内人民而加紧其国外的侵略。我们反对帝国主义者的侵略，反对反动统治者加在日本人民头上的迫害，拥护你们要求无条件释放松川事件被捕工人的运动。同时，你们英勇的反压迫的斗争，并非孤立无援，而是有中国和全世界劳动人民做后盾，并给予你们一切可能的援助的。在全世界和平自由人民的面前，像松川事件这类无耻的罪恶暴行，必将受到人民的坚决反抗。祝你们胜利。
                                中国人民救济总会主席  宋庆龄
                                      一九五○年十二月十八日
