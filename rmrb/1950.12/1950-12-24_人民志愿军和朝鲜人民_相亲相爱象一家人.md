Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in North Korea, December 23rd: Our correspondent at the Korean front reports: The Korean people love the Chinese People's Volunteers. The following is one of thousands of touching examples.

The Fourth Squad of a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteers was billeted in the home of Old Lady Gao Tianming in Shengfang-li. Her two sons had both joined the People's Army. The old lady loved our soldiers as if they were her own sons. The soldiers of the Fourth Squad also felt as if they were in their own home, taking time every day to help her fetch water, thresh rice, and chop firewood, so that the water vat in her house was always full. Every time the soldiers brought water back, the old lady would hurriedly take their frostbitten hands and tell them to warm themselves by the fire. After the soldiers returned from their missions, she would have hot water ready for them to wash their faces. To keep the soldiers from getting cold, she carefully patched up all the holes in the windows. At every meal, she would bring some pickles, but the soldiers always politely refused. The old lady remembered that she had brewed a vat of wine, and it would be ready in three days. She gestured to the soldiers that she wanted to invite them to drink. One night, the soldiers who stayed at home were already asleep when she brought a large bottle of wine and secretly placed it next to the soldiers' quilts, followed by cups, chopsticks, and side dishes. When the soldiers discovered the wine and dishes, they immediately returned them to her. After sending and returning them two or three times, the old lady anxiously told the translator, "I'm only making this wine once this year, and if they don't drink it, they're looking down on me." The translator also advised the soldiers to accept it. The soldiers were really in a difficult position, and after discussing it for a while, they decided to pay for it. The old lady insisted on not accepting the money, and the soldiers firmly stated that if she didn't accept the money, they wouldn't drink the wine. The old lady had no choice but to accept the money. She said, "You came to help us fight the American robbers, I don't know how to thank you enough!"

    人民志愿军和朝鲜人民
    相亲相爱象一家人
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十三日电】本社朝鲜前线记者报道：朝鲜人民热爱中国人民志愿军。下面是千百个动人事例中的一个。
    人民志愿军某连第四班住在胜芳里的老大娘高天明家里。她的两个儿子都参加了人民军。老大娘把我们的战士当作是她的儿子一样地疼爱。四班战士们也象是住在自己的家里一样，天天抽空帮她打水、打稻、劈柴，使她家的水缸里的水总是满满的。每次战士们提水回来，老大娘就急忙拉着他们冻红了的手，要他们去烤火，战士们出外执行任务回来后，她早就预备好了热水给战士们洗脸。为了使战士们不要受冻，她细心地把窗户上的洞都糊补好。每餐饭时，她都要送些咸菜来，战士们每次都婉言谢绝了。老大娘想起自己酿了一缸酒，再过三天酒就熟了。她用手势比划着告诉战士们要请他们喝酒。一天夜晚，留在家里的战士已经睡了，她送来一大瓶酒，偷偷地放在战士们的被盖旁边，接着又送来杯、筷、小菜。战士们发现了这些酒菜，立刻给她送回去，这样三番两次地送来退去，老大娘发急地告诉翻译员说：“我今年只做这一回酒，他们不喝就是看不起我。”翻译员也劝告战士们还是接受了好。战士们真觉得为难，大家商量了一阵，决定付钱买。老大娘执意不收钱，战士们也坚决表示：如果不收钱，就不喝酒。老大娘才无可奈何地收下了钱。她说：“你们来帮助我们打美国强盗，我不知要怎样感谢你们才好！”
