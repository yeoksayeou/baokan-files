    In a mountain village behind the northwestern Korean front, we met Kim Sun-hwa, a woman in her twenties. She is one of the thousands of Koreans in the rear who refuse to be slaves and are striving for freedom. Having temporarily left her hometown not long ago, she has now returned home with the victorious counter-attacking Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Kim Sun-hwa confided to us the tragic experiences she personally encountered and witnessed during the retreat north.

    When the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops launched a massive and frenzied offensive in northwestern Korea, Kim Sun-hwa's husband stayed behind enemy lines to continue fighting. She followed her husband's advice and took her child, joining the ranks of the elderly, weak, women, and children heading north. From Nyongbyon to Unsan was only sixty li, but the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops quickly caught up with the retreating crowd and frantically fired on these unarmed people. Braving enemy fire and in the bitter cold wind, these unyielding people still resolutely walked in the direction of the enemy's artillery bombardment. They knew that their own forces were there.

    In the city of Unsan, occupied by the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops, Kim Sun-hwa endured several miserable and dark days. She saw the Syngman Rhee troops intercept many young women, forcing them to wash clothes during the day and taking turns raping them at night. She heard a Syngman Rhee soldier say: "Anyway, we know we are going to die in North Korea, so we must enjoy every day we live!" These beasts used slaughter and rape to relieve their dying days. Kim Sun-hwa was also dragged to cook for them, and the bandits tried to defile her, but she cleverly dealt with them and escaped being violated. The sisters who were captured by the bandit troops lived an inhuman life, but they did not lose confidence in victory. When everyone met, although they did not know each other, they talked about how the People's Army would definitely return and speculated about the day the People's Army would return. Kim Sun-hwa and another suffering sister took the opportunity to escape the clutches of the bandit troops, fled Unsan, and arrived at a small village far from the highway. That very night, someone quietly spread the word: "The troops have entered the village." Before long, Kim Sun-hwa indeed saw the troops, saw the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that had chivalrously extended a helping hand when the Korean people were in deep distress. That night, Kim Sun-hwa and her companion were so excited that they could not close their eyes. Early the next morning, she and many others followed the victorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army south, heading back to their hometown. The whole way was familiar to Kim Sun-hwa. Everywhere were the corpses of compatriots killed by the bandit troops, and the villages along the way were burned down, but the bandits were also eliminated and driven away. Kim Sun-hwa excitedly said to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "Thank you, we have returned victoriously, you have avenged us! With your help, our victory is even more assured!" Another old lady added: "Hit them hard! Kill these robbers!" Thousands upon thousands of Korean people, with heavy hearts, temporarily left their beloved hometowns, and now they are stepping on the path of victory, returning to their hometowns with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    金顺花胜利回来了
    新华社朝鲜前线通讯
    在朝鲜西北战线后方的一个山庄里，我们遇到了一个二十多岁的妇女金顺花，她是万千个不愿做奴隶而奔向自由的后方的朝鲜人民当中的一个。在她暂时离开她的家乡不久以后，现在已经随着胜利反攻的中国人民志愿军回到家乡去。
    金顺花向我们倾诉了她在北撤途中亲身经历和目击的悲痛遭遇。
    当美李匪军疯狂地向朝鲜西北部大规模进攻时，金顺花的丈夫便留在敌人后方坚持战斗，她听从丈夫的意见带着孩子，跟随着老弱妇孺的行列奔向北方。从宁边到云山只有六十里，美李匪军很快赶上了后撤的人群，并疯狂地向这些手无寸铁的人们射击。冒着敌人的射击，在凛冽的寒风中，这些不屈服的人民仍坚定地向敌人大炮轰击的方向走去。他们知道那里就有自己的队伍。
    在美李匪军占领的云山城里，金顺花挨过了几个悲惨黑暗的日子。看见了李匪军截住了很多年轻的妇女，白天强迫她们洗衣，夜间就轮流奸污。她听见一个李匪军说：“反正我们知道要死在北朝鲜了，活一天就要快乐一天！”这些野兽就以屠杀、强奸来排遣他们临死前的日子。金顺花也被他们拉去做饭，匪徒们也曾经要污辱她，可是被她巧妙地应付过去，而幸免被蹂躏。被匪军捉住的姐妹们，过着非人的生活，但是他们没有丧失胜利的信心。大家碰在一起，虽然互不相识，可是都相互谈着人民军一定会回来和猜测着人民军回来的日子。金顺花和另一个受难的姐妹乘隙逃脱了匪军的魔爪，奔出了云山，到了离公路很远的一个小村子里。就在这天的夜里，有人悄悄地传话：“队伍进村了。”不多一会，金顺花果然看到了部队，看到了当朝鲜人民陷入深重灾难时侠义地伸出了援助之手的中国人民志愿军。这一晚，金顺花和她的伙伴都兴奋得没有合上眼。第二天一大早，她和很多人就跟着中国人民志愿军胜利南进，奔回自己的家乡。一路都是金顺花走过的地方。到处都是被匪军杀死的同胞的尸体，沿路的村庄被烧毁了，可是匪徒们也被消灭和赶跑了。金顺花兴奋地对中国人民志愿军的战士说：“谢谢你们，我们胜利地回来了，你们给我们报了仇呀！有了你们的帮助，我们的胜利就更有了把握！”另外一个老大娘接着说：“要狠狠地打！打死这些强盗！”成千成万的朝鲜人民怀着沉重的心情暂时离开了可爱的家乡，现在已经踏着胜利的脚步，随着中国人民志愿军回到自己的家乡去。
