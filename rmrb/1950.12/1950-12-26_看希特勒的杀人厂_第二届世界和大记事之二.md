	Seeing Hitler's Killing Factory
	--Second World and Major Events, Part Two
	By Our Correspondent with the Peace Delegation, Yuan Shuipai
	Around the time of the conference, we visited several museums and factories in the Soviet Union and Poland. We enjoyed the civilization created by the working people of past eras and the socialist and people's democratic eras. During this time, we also came to know the "civilization" that the imperialists boasted about—which we saw at the Polish National Museum in Auschwitz.
	On a cold and gloomy afternoon, we arrived by train at the previously unremarkable, now world-renowned Polish town of Oświęcim (Auschwitz) and the adjacent Birkenau, 286 kilometers southwest of Warsaw, near the Czechoslovak border. Because in this basin, full of swamps, mud, and the stench of decay, the Nazi bandits had built the largest concentration camp and killing factory in Europe. In order to preserve the truth of history and to ensure that their own nation and all mankind would forever remember this towering crime of fascism, the Polish people transformed the original prison cells and execution grounds into a museum.
	I have a map of Poland here. Like dense rashes on a body, it is marked with dots of three colors, indicating the more than five hundred concentration camps and killing factories of various sizes scattered throughout Poland during the German occupation. Four large black dots are killing factories, three large red dots are concentration camps combined with killing factories, and the remaining medium and small red dots are purely concentration camps (not including killing factories) and their sub-camps (Auschwitz alone had forty-four sub-camps), and the more numerous green dots and green circles are labor camps and transit camps.
	The Auschwitz-Birkenau that we visited was one of the large red dots and one of the medium red dots.
	In the cold wind, we took off our hats, stood before the victims' memorial, and laid flowers in tribute. The people killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau included those of eighteen nationalities, numbering over four million. Therefore, this museum is also called the "Museum of Four Million People Massacred." The architecture of the concentration camp is similar to the two-story buildings of what is called "New Village" in Shanghai. The twenty-eight buildings are made of ordinary red bricks and appear no different from ordinary residences, but a gloomy air of death hangs over them. The perimeter is a double layer of four-meter-high barbed wire, with a one-meter gap between the wires. Near the wire, some wooden signs are posted, painted with black skulls and crossbones, with the words "Stop!" written in both German and Polish. Watchtowers stand everywhere.
	Our guide, a Polish youth, had himself been imprisoned in this concentration camp, and still bears a blue prisoner number on his left arm. He pointed to the words "Work Sets You Free" on the gate of the camp and said that because the architectural facilities here were relatively decent, the Nazis used it as a model camp for people to visit. Of course, writing these words was also intended to conceal its true nature. After we saw the pictures, models, and artifacts displayed in each prison building, we understood the Nazis' so-called "labor" and "freedom," and the so-called "model" had no other meaning than to demonstrate the pinnacle of fascist barbarism and unimaginable cruelty.
	Between buildings 10 and 11 is a "Death Wall" made of black lacquered wooden planks and a gallows. Twenty-six thousand people were killed in front of this wall. Fearing resistance from those being killed, the Nazis used pliers to tighten barbed wire around their hands until the barbs dug into their flesh. The gallows were specifically for killing political prisoners, including staunch communists and outstanding scientists.
	The "prisoners" assigned to labor teams started hard labor every day at 4:30 in the morning. When they rested depended on the whims of the Nazis, sometimes working until late at night. Many prisoners were murdered or died of exhaustion at their work sites every day. Upon completion of work, their companions had to push or carry their bodies back to the concentration camp by handcart or on their backs. Even the dead had to line up with the living to be counted by the Nazis. Music was played during departure and return, or while working. The band was also composed of prisoners. This is what fascist "civilization" was like: while the sounds of whipping, shooting, and dogs devouring people echoed, so did the sounds of violins, flutes, and clarinets...
	Each prison cell was crowded with prisoners, with four or five people sleeping on each bed. The guide showed us a very small basement where thirty people had once been confined at once. Another small room, shaped like a chimney, was for confining escapees. People could only be squeezed in through a small hole near the ground. Four people were confined at a time in this "standing cage".
	In addition to whipping, starvation, standing at attention for hours on end, and standing holding stones, the Nazi bandits often stuffed prisoners' heads into furnaces, and used water to fill their ears, pulled out fingernails, punctured testicles, burned women with red-hot iron rods, and dug out intestines with iron hooks. One Nazi liked shooting people; he confessed that he had personally shot 25,000 people. One Nazi liked torturing pregnant women, kicking them in the abdomen. One Nazi liked dismembering living people. One Nazi liked to kill prisoners (including infants) by injecting them with poison; he often toured the cells, randomly selecting "materials" to satisfy his perversions. Some Nazis also liked to release wolves to chase and devour fleeing prisoners, and often brought some Nazi women to watch the scene together, because they loved to watch it!
	During the conference, we watched the Polish film "The Last Stage," which won the Peace Prize, which depicted the concentration camp. In one scene, while the executioner was torturing a female prisoner with a branding iron, he also turned on a gramophone to listen to records!
	Fascist "art" is inseparable from slaughter, and so is fascist "science".
	Building 10 was used for "scientific" experiments. German fascist scientists and doctors treated living people as mice and rabbits, arbitrarily cutting them up. Eliminating male and female reproductive functions; injecting syphilis and various other germs to test drug effectiveness; irradiating with X-rays, causing "prisoners" to die in agonizing pain. After serious surgery, no bandaging or treatment was given, allowing them to rot to death, or they were immediately shot after various "surgeries".
	People arrested and sent to the camp died in this way or that. And the time would not be long, dying in a matter of days, or in one or two weeks. "Not exceeding three months" was the "law" stipulated by the Nazi SS managing the concentration camp. When the newly arrived prisoners walked through the gate marked "Work Sets You Free," the Nazi leader gave this speech: "You have not come to a sanatorium, but to a German concentration camp. There is no door to go out, unless through that chimney. If anyone doesn't like this, he can immediately walk to the electric fence..."
	The chimney he referred to was the many chimneys of the Birkenau killing factory that burned people day and night. No matter where in the concentration camp, people could always see the towering chimneys in the sky spewing thick smoke, annihilating Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Latvians, as well as Germans, Italians, Soviets, Romanians, Hungarians, French, Norwegians, Persians, Egyptians, Spaniards, Greeks, and Swiss, as well as Chinese.
	Birkenau, with its gas chambers and cremation ovens, was only three kilometers from Auschwitz. We arrived in a short time by car. It was an endless muddy grassland, lined with long rows of barracks, most of which had been blown up by the German bandits as they fled. Only remnants of the gas chambers and cremation ovens remained. The barracks were gradually expanded and added to at the time, reaching a maximum of about 300 buildings, which could accommodate 200,000 people. But as long as the cremation ovens were free, men, women, old and young, children and infants captured from all over Europe would be slaughtered as soon as they got off the train, without waiting overnight. From a document, we learned that in a certain period in 1943, out of the people transported by 76 trains, only 7,253 were left and sent to the concentration camp. The remaining 24,688 were immediately sent to the gas chambers, and none of the women and children were left.
	For the convenience of transportation, the German bandits specially built a railway leading to here. After getting off the train, after thirteen procedures, all the belongings carried were gradually searched and cleaned out, and finally they were naked. If there were too many people and the procedures could not be completed in one day, or if the train arrived in the afternoon, they had to stand naked in the open space, regardless of wind, rain, summer heat, or winter cold, waiting until dawn to continue the procedures. When stripping off their clothes, the Nazis told them that they were being sent to work in Germany, and that they had to take a bath, disinfect, and change into new clothes first, and even gave them soap and towels. But these were all lies, and these things were of no use at all.
	Barefoot and naked people walked non-stop from the station platform to the gas chambers (bodies were constantly being cleared from the gas chambers). The elderly and the sick who could not walk were transported by truck. On both sides of the road, the Nazi SS aimed their machine guns. When this scene was reproduced in the film, we saw innocent four- or five-year-old children walking happily, even smiling at the executioners beside them along the way!
	The gas chambers were built underground, and their area varied, some were 400 square meters, some were 500 square meters, also adapted to needs, gradually expanded and added. Fake sprinkler heads were installed on the ceiling, but they never sprayed water. The gas used was hydrogen cyanide, which fell and diffused from several wire mesh pillars. From the testimony of witnesses, we know that the situation at the time was like this: the faces of those who were gassed showed expressions of pain and panic, with white foam coming out of their mouths, and red and cyan spots on their skin, blood flowing from their nostrils, most with their eyes wide open, bending their bodies, many embracing each other, and the people closest to the door were the most crowded. The museum displays models of the gas chambers and the victims - it is truly a picture of hell that is difficult to look at!
	We saw the remnants of the destroyed gas chambers and cremation ovens. Buildings of cement and iron bars left over from the bombing remained in the weeds. Some places were hung with wreaths, and braziers were lit, with wisps of green smoke rising into the gray sky. The guide pointed to the white particles on the ground and said, "These are the human bones left over from burning." We looked around, and everywhere in the grass and soil were such white particles.
	Fourty thousand people could be gassed in one day, but the cremation ovens could only burn twenty-four thousand people in one day. So later, the cremation ovens were no longer used, but were simply piled up in the open space, poured with oil, and a large number of corpses were eliminated. Before burning, all the gold teeth were knocked out (forty prisoners did this work every day), and rings and earrings were also taken off, and women's hair was also cut off. The large glass cabinet in the museum still displays 7,000 kilograms of hair, which the German bandits had not had time to transport before the Soviet Red Army arrived, and fled in a hurry. Another glass cabinet, like a shop window, contained a piece of yellow-brown "woolen cloth" - woven from hair! Letters between the concentration camp and German factories were hung on the wall, discussing the price of "goods" (hair).
	In other exhibition rooms, there are large piles of shoes, large piles of combs, large piles of artificial legs and hands, large piles of tin pots, bowls, and dishes, large piles of toothbrushes, large piles of glasses, large piles of men's shaving brushes... These are all the belongings of the gassed victims, which the Nazis did not have time to transport away. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, there were a total of thirty-five storage rooms, and the enemy burned down twenty-nine before retreating. Of the remaining six, there were 836,255 sets of women's clothing alone. Evidence shows that from December 1, 1944 to January 15, 1945, in just one and a half months, 99,922 sets of children's clothing, 192,652 sets of women's clothing, and 222,269 sets of men's clothing were transported from this concentration camp to the "Third Reich". In addition to clothing, the value of the cash and jewelry carried by the people is also difficult to estimate. One document indicates that a certain time prisoners were transported from Hungary, and 178 million marks, 240,000 US dollars, and many women's watches, etc., were obtained from them. A detailed account records it in great detail.
	In addition to cruelly, systematically, and scientifically eliminating large numbers of people, Hitler did not forget to rob property, from francs, liras, shillings, US dollars in people's wallets... gold watches in their pockets... all the way to false teeth in their mouths, women's hair... he wanted everything. Fearing that there were hidden belongings, he used special X-ray instruments to search them. Finally, he even took the fat from the corpses as raw material for making soap! When capitalism develops to the fascist stage, and finally reaches the point of bankruptcy and collapse, it nakedly exposes the essence of its gangsterism.
	We walked through room after room of the museum, and we looked at crime after crime with agitation and anger. We thought of how Hitler's slaughter and plunder are not being repeated in Korea today? Isn't another Hitler there today strafing women and children, and doing the same things of brutally eliminating the population and shamelessly plundering property? According to reports in Pravda, the new Hitler has already established ten death concentration camps in Korea... Similarly, those Star-Spangled Banner "doctors" and 卍-shaped "scientists" are also using living people as mice and rabbits for experiments...
	The gallows of Nuremberg are also waiting for them!
	The Polish guide who took us on the tour repeatedly told us before leaving that the chief culprit of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and killing factory, Nazi SS General Oswald Pohl, had long been released and reused by the American occupying forces. Yes, the American imperialists are following the path of their teachers.

    看希特勒的杀人厂
    ——第二届世界和大记事之二
    本报随和大代表团记者  袁水拍
    在大会开会前后，我们参观了苏联和波兰的若干博物馆和工厂。我们饱览了过去时代的和社会主义、人民民主主义时代的劳动人民所创造的文明。在这期间，我们也认识了帝国主义者所夸耀的他们自己的“文明”——那是在奥斯威辛的一座波兰国家博物馆中见到的。
    在一个寒冷而阴沉的下午，我们乘火车到达了距离华沙西南二八六公里，靠近捷克斯拉夫边境的一个战前没没无闻而现在已经举世皆知的波兰小镇奥斯威辛和紧靠着它的勃莱秦卡。因为在这片到处沼泽，充满泥泞和散发着腐物秽气的盆地上，纳粹匪徒曾经建立过一座欧洲最大的集中营和杀人厂。波兰人民为了使历史的真相得以保存，使他们自己民族和全人类世世代代永远记住这法西斯的滔天大罪，他们把原来的牢房和刑场改造成了博物馆。
    我手边有这样一幅波兰地图。像人身上长着密密麻麻的斑疹一样，上面画着三种颜色的圆点，标明在德寇占领期间，满布在波兰全境的五百余座大小不等的集中营和杀人厂。其中四个大黑点是杀人厂，三个大红点是集中营兼杀人厂，其余的中红点和小红点是单纯的（不连带杀人厂的）集中营及其分营（单是奥斯威辛一个集中营就有四十四个分营），为数更多的绿点和绿圈是劳动营和输送营。
    我们所参观的奥斯威辛——勃莱秦卡就是其中的一个大红点和一个中红点。
    在寒风里我们脱帽站在被害者的纪念碑前献花致敬。在奥斯威辛——勃莱秦卡被杀的人包括十八个国籍，数达四百万以上。因此，这博物馆也叫做“四百万人遭屠杀的博物馆”。集中营的建筑和上海什么“新村”的二层楼房子相似，一起二十八幢是普通红砖砌的，外表上看来好像和平常的住宅没有什么不同，但是有一种阴沉的死亡的气息笼罩着。周围是双重的四公尺高的有刺电网，网与网之间隔开一公尺。近网处，插着一些木牌，上画黑色的髑髅和交叉的人骨，用德波两种文字写着“止步！”到处矗立着了望塔。
    我们的向导，一个波兰青年，自己也曾在这个集中营里囚禁过，他的左臂上至今还留着一行蓝色的囚徒号码。他指着这个营的大门的一行字“劳动使你自由”说，纳粹为了这里的建筑设备还比较像样，所以当时把它作为模范营，供人参观。写这一行字，当然也是为了要蒙蔽它的实质。当我们看完了一幢一幢牢监里所陈列的图片、模型和实物以后，就了解了纳粹的所谓“劳动”与“自由”，而所谓“模范”，除掉表现法西斯主义的登峰造极的野蛮与超乎想像的残忍以外，也没有别的意义了。
    在第十与第十一幢之间有一座黑漆的木板做的“死墙”和一个绞架。在这座墙前，先后害死过二万六千人。纳粹害怕被杀者反抗，他们用有刺铁丝用钳子把他们的双手绞紧，直到铁刺陷进肉中才算数。那个绞架是专门杀害政治犯的，包括坚贞不屈的共产主义者和优秀的科学家们。
    被编入劳动队的“囚徒”每天早晨四时半就开始做苦工，什么时候休息要凭纳粹的高兴，有时一直工作到深夜。每天有许多囚徒在工作地点被虐杀或疲劳倒毙。到完工时，同伴们必须把他们的尸体用手车推或者背在背上带回集中营。即使死了也要排在活人一起，听候纳粹来点名。在出发和归队或者工作的时候，还要奏乐，乐队也由囚徒组成。法西斯的“文明”就是这样：一边响着鞭打声，枪杀声，狼狗噬人声，一边也响着小提琴声，竖笛声，单簧箫声……
    每一间囚室拥挤着囚徒，每张床上睡四五人。向导指给我们看一间很小的地下室，那儿曾经一次关过三十人。另外一间形如烟囱的小间，是禁闭逃犯的。只有通过靠近地面的一个小洞才可以把人塞进去。在这“站笼”里一次禁闭站四个人。
    除了鞭打，饥饿，连续几小时的立正，举着石块站立等等刑罚外，纳粹匪徒还经常把囚犯的头部塞进火炉里去，以及用水灌耳，拔指甲，刺睾丸，用烧红铁棒烫女人，用铁钩挖肠等等。有一个纳粹喜欢枪毙，据他自供，他曾亲手枪毙过二万五千人；有一个纳粹喜欢虐杀孕妇，用脚踢她们的腹部；有一个纳粹喜欢支解活人；有一个纳粹喜欢用毒药注射在囚徒身上（包括婴儿）来杀死他们，他经常巡游各牢房，随意选一些“材料”带回去满足他的癖好；还有一些纳粹则喜欢放出狼狗去追噬奔逃的囚徒，并且还经常带着一些纳粹妇女，一块儿去欣赏那场面，因为她们也很爱看！
    在大会期间我们看了此次获得和平奖金的描写集中营的波兰电影《最后阶段》，其中有一场面：当刽子手用烙铁摧残女囚徒时，他一面还开起留声机听唱片！
    法西斯主义的“艺术”和屠杀分不开，法西斯主义的“科学”也是这样。
    第十幢牢房就是做“科学”实验用的。德国法西斯科学家和医生把活人当作老鼠和兔子，随意斩割。消灭男女生殖机能；注射梅毒等各种病菌，试验药品效能；照射Ｘ光，使“囚犯们”在辗转挣扎的痛楚中死去。经过严重的手术后也决不加以包扎治疗，任其腐烂至死，或者施行各种“手术”后，马上加以枪毙。
    被捕入营的人不是这样死掉，便是那样死掉。而且时间也不会长，不是几天中死掉，便是一二星期中死掉，“不得超过三个月”是管理集中营的纳粹党卫军所规定的“法律”。当新来的囚徒们走进那扇标着“劳动使你自由”的大门时，纳粹头子这样演说：“现在你们来到的不是一座休养所，而是德国集中营。这里没有门可以出去，除非经过那烟囱。如果有人不喜欢这样，他可以立刻走到电网上去……”
    他所指的烟囱就是那不分日夜烧着人的勃莱秦卡杀人厂的许多烟囱。不管在集中营里的什么地方，人们随时可以望见高耸空中的烟囱吐着浓烟，消灭着犹太人、吉卜西人、波兰人、捷克人、斯洛伐克人、拉脱维亚人、以及德、意、苏、罗、匈、法、挪威、波斯、埃及、西班牙、希腊、瑞士等国人，也有中国人。
    设有毒气室和烧人炉的勃莱秦卡距离奥斯威辛只有三公里，我们坐汽车去不一会儿就到。那是一片望不见边的泥泞草地，排列着一长列又一长列的营房，大部分已被德寇在逃跑时炸毁了。毒气室和烧人炉仅留残迹。营房是当时逐步扩充添筑的，最多时达三百座左右，可容二十万人。但是只要烧人炉有空的时候，从欧洲各地捕来的男女老少、儿童和婴孩，是不等到过夜，一下火车就要被屠杀的。从一个证件中，我们知道在一九四三年某一时期内，统计七十六次火车载来的人，只有七二五三个被留下，送到集中营去。其余二四六八八人，都被立刻送进毒气室，所有的妇女和孩子一个也没有留下。
    为了运输便利，德匪特别筑了一条铁道通到这里。人们下了车经过十三道手续后，所有携带的物件便逐步被搜净尽了，最后是光身。如果人数多，手续来不及在一天中做完，或者有时火车在下午到达，那么他们只得赤裸着身子，不论刮风下雨，暑天寒冬，一律站在空地上，等到天亮再继续办手续。剥去衣服的时候，纳粹向他们说是为了送他们到德国去工作，先要洗澡、消毒和换新衣服，甚至发给他们肥皂和浴巾。但这些全是欺骗，这些东西全无用处。
    从车站月台到毒气室川流不息地走着赤脚光身的人（毒气室内不断出清尸体）。走不动的老人和病人，用卡车载送。在路的两旁，纳粹党卫军用机枪瞄准着。当电影上把这一幕重现时，我们看见天真的四五岁的小孩，愉快地走着，一路上还向旁边的刽子手们微笑着！
    毒气室是建筑在地下的，它的面积不一律，有的四百平方公尺，有的五百平方公尺，也是适应需要，逐步扩充加建的。天花板上假装着喷水龙头，但从没有喷过水。所用的毒气是氢化?，从几个铁丝网的柱子里落下弥散。从证人的口中，知道当时的情况是这样：被毒死者的脸上显露着痛苦和惊慌的表情，嘴里吐着白沫，皮肤透出红色和青色的斑点，鼻孔流血，大多数睁大眼睛，屈曲着身体，不少人拥抱在一起，靠近门的地方人挤得最多。博物馆中陈列着毒气室和被害人们的模型——那真是难以注视的一幅地狱的图画啊！
    我们看到了被毁灭的毒气室和烧人炉的残迹。荒草堆里留着炸剩的水泥铁筋的建筑物。有些地方挂着花圈，燃着火盆，袅袅青烟升入灰黯的空中。向导指着地面上的白色颗粒说：“这些就是烧剩的人骨。”我们向四周看去，草里和土里，到处都是这样的白粒。
    一天工夫可以毒死四万人，但是烧人炉子一天只能烧二万四千人。所以到后来，烧人炉也不用了，只是在空地上堆起来，泼上油，大量地消灭尸体。在烧毁以前，所有的金牙全部敲去（每天由四十个囚徒做这项工作），指环和耳环也一并取下，女人的头发也都剪去。博物馆的大玻璃柜里至今陈列着七千公斤的头发，那是在苏联红军到达前，德寇仓皇奔逃，未及运走的一部分。另一玻璃柜里，就像商店的橱窗里一样，放着一匹黄褐色的“呢绒”——头发织的！墙壁上挂着集中营和德国工厂来往的信件，信内讨论着“货色”（头发）的价格。
    在别的陈列室里，还有大堆的鞋子、大堆的梳子、大堆的假腿假手、大堆的洋铁锅盆碗碟、大堆的牙刷、大堆的眼镜、大堆的男人用的剃须刷……这些都是被毒死者的遗物，也是纳粹来不及运走的。在奥斯威辛集中营，共有三十五座储藏室，敌人撤退前，烧毁了二十九座。余下的六座中，单是成套的女人衣服就有八三六、二五五套。从证据中发现，从一九四四年十二月一日到一九四五年一月十五日，短短一个半月内，从这个集中营运到“第三帝国”去的儿童衣服有九九、九二二套，女人衣服有一九二、六五二套，男人衣服有二二二、二六九套。除了衣物之外，人们身上所带的现款和首饰的价值也难于统计。有一文件表示：某一次从匈牙利运来囚徒，从他们身上得到了一亿七千八百万马克、二十四万美元，以及多少的女表等，一篇细帐记载得很详细。
    希特勒除了凶残地、有计划地、科学地大量消灭人口外，他并没有忘记抢劫财物，从人们钱包里的法郎、利拉、先令、美金……口袋里的金表……一直到嘴里的假牙、女人的头发……什么都要。恐怕有被隐藏的财物，他再用特制的Ｘ光仪器来搜查。最后他把尸首的脂肪也取来作为制肥皂的原料！资本主义发展到法西斯阶段，最后临到破产崩溃的地步，就赤裸裸地暴露了它强盗的骨子。
    我们走过博物馆的一室又一室，我们激动而愤怒地看了一件罪行又一件罪行，我们想起了希特勒的屠杀和劫掠今天不是正在朝鲜重复着进行吗？今天不是又一个希特勒在那儿扫射妇女儿童，在那儿同样干着残暴地消灭人口，无耻地劫掠财物的勾当吗？据真理报的报道，那新的希特勒已经在朝鲜建立了十座死亡集中营……同样地，那些星条旗的“医生”正和卍字章的“科学家”也在把活人当作老鼠和兔子做试验……
    纽伦堡的绞架同样也等待着他们！
    带我们参观的波兰向导临走时一再告诉我们，奥斯威辛——勃莱秦卡集中营和杀人厂的首犯纳粹党卫军波尔将军（Oswald Pohl）早已被美占领军释放并且起用了。是的，美帝国主义者正在走着他们老师的道路。
