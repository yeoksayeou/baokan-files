    Opposing the U.S. Plot to Conclude a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    The China Association for Promoting Democracy Firmly Expresses Support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a statement on the 9th supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue. The full text is as follows:
    For more than five years, U.S. imperialism has violated the Potsdam Proclamation and the basic policy towards post-surrender Japan adopted by the Far Eastern Commission. Under MacArthur's reckless actions, it has been actively turning Japan into an exclusive U.S. colony and a military base for launching new wars of aggression in the Far East. In recent months, MacArthur has used Japan as a supply base for the war of aggression against Korea and has used some Japanese military personnel to participate in the war of aggression against Korea and the occupation of our country's Taiwan. The facts have become particularly obvious. The memorandum recently proposed by U.S. State Department advisor Dulles clearly indicates that U.S. imperialism is openly tearing up sacred international agreements, obliterating the significant contribution of our people in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan and our fundamental interests in this matter, and attempting to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to more easily use Japan as a military base for aggressive actions. All of this clearly directly harms the interests of our people and threatens our security, and will further undermine peace and security in the Far East. We firmly support all points in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of the 4th of this month. The Japanese peace treaty must be based entirely on the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation's basic policy toward post-surrender Japan, drafted by the foreign ministers of our Central People's Government and the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and maintain the principle of great power unanimity. The U.S. use of Japan as a military base to carry out aggression in the Far East must be stopped as soon as possible, and Japan's aggressive forces must be thoroughly eliminated. The preparation and signing of the Japanese peace treaty should be carried out as quickly as possible so that Japan can break free from U.S. control and, in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation, re-establish its peaceful economy and democratic politics needed by the people to ensure peace and security in the Far East.

    反对美国单独对日媾和阴谋
    民主促进会坚决表示拥护周恩来外长声明
    【新华社十日讯】中国民主促进会九日发表拥护周外长关于对日和约问题声明的声明，全文如下：
    五年多以来，美帝国主义者违反波茨坦公告以及远东委员会通过的对投降后日本的基本政策，在麦克阿瑟的蛮干之下，积极地把日本变为美国的独占殖民地和它在远东发动新侵略战争的军事基地。近数月来，麦克阿瑟以日本为侵朝战争供应基地，并利用一部分日本军事人员参加侵朝战争和侵占我国的台湾，事实已经特别明显了。美国国务院顾问杜勒斯最近提出的备忘录，明白表示美帝国主义公然撕毁神圣的国际协定，抹煞我国人民八年对日抗战的重大贡献和在这一问题上的基本利益，妄图单独对日签订和约以便更便利于利用日本为军事基地的侵略行动。所有这一切，显然直接损害我国人民的利益和威胁我国的安全，并将更进一步破坏远东的和平与安全。我们坚决拥护本月四日周恩来外长声明中的各点。对日和约必须完全以开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告对投降后日本的基本政策为基础，由我中央人民政府及苏、美、英四国外长进行草拟，并保持大国一致原则。美国利用日本为军事基地在远东进行侵略的行为必须及早加以制止，日本的侵略势力必须彻底清除；对日和约的准备及签订应该尽速进行，使日本得以摆脱美国的控制，依照波茨坦公告，从新建立其为人民所需要的和平经济和民主政治，以确保远东的和平与安全。
