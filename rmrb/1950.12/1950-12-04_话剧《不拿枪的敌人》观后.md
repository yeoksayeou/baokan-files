    After Watching the Play "Enemies Without Guns"
    Zhu Bo
    Recently, the three-act, nine-scene play "Enemies Without Guns" performed by the New Life Theatre at the Beijing Theater is a script with great educational significance. This is not a fictional story, but a true situation.
    After we achieved victory nationwide, a sense of peace and complacency grew among some cadres, who believed that since the whole country had been won and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang of more than eight million troops had been wiped out, there was nothing to fear, and they could live a stable life. However, they forgot about the enemies without guns hidden in various places, who, under the instigation of American imperialism and the Chiang bandits, were using armed and non-armed methods of all kinds to make dying struggles by exploiting the gaps in our work. They tried every means to sabotage our country's production and construction and undermine the happy lives of the people. "Enemies Without Guns" is a story that exposes the crimes of these enemy agents.
    This depicts the story of an anti-espionage struggle in an old liberated area village in North China. After the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, the special agent and returning landlord, Huang Jinkui, returned to the village, using fishing all day as a cover for his conspiracy activities. His son, Huang Shaokui, was a stray soldier and Chiang bandit agent who frequently contacted hidden enemy agents in Tianjin to obtain instructions from the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Taiwan. He used "Broken Shoes" Ba Cou Niang to open a grocery store as a place for secret meetings of special agents. He colluded with Cai Bingjun, who had been struggled against by the masses for being a puppet Bao head, and Huang Jinkui even used his daughter-in-law to seduce the loafer Su Luojian to carry out various conspiracies together.
    Zhang Qing, the Communist Party branch secretary and security officer of the village, went to the county for a meeting, leaving the remaining village cadres disunited. The newly appointed village chief, Zhang Fulu, dared not take bold responsibility for his work. Li Zhijiang, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, had a very serious coercive commanding style, acting blindly without thinking, and was prejudiced against others. Wang Lober, the director of the Farmers' Association, had a mind full of peaceful complacency, thinking that now that the whole country had been won, they could live peacefully. In addition, a few people held the attitude of "each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." This gave enemy agents and returning landlords a gap to carry out sabotage activities.
    The enemy agents first lured the lazy man Yi Tiao Cha into gambling, wanting to use this to drag Yi Tiao Cha into the water, and then planned to set fire to the masses' wheat. Their plan was: Huang Shaokui would burn the wheat, Su Luojian would pretend to be a good person and give the village cadres a false report, saying that Yi Tiao Cha set the fire, and Cai Bingjun would be responsible for leading Yi Tiao Cha to the edge of the village, so that the village cadres could catch him. In this way, the enemy agents' conspiracy was realized.
    When the branch secretary and security officer Zhang Qing returned from the county, after seeing this situation, he first led the village cadres to conduct a review of their work, pointing out that the disunity of the village cadres gave the bad guys the opportunity to carry out sabotage. Uncle Luo Zhong of the anti-espionage team and Grandma Stone, and other emancipated peasants, reported in detail how Huang Jinkui and other bandits and agents had lured Yi Tiao Cha and used Ba Cou Niang to open a grocery store to cover up espionage activities. This made Zhang Qing realize that if Yi Tiao Cha didn't set the fire, then even if Yi Tiao Cha did set the fire, it was instigated by Huang Jinkui and others. On the one hand, Zhang Qing deployed activists to monitor the activities of bad elements, and on the other hand, he went deep among the masses to further understand the situation. The special agents knew that Yi Tiao Cha had not been detained, so they deliberately told Yi Tiao Cha that Zhang Luoshou knew who set the fire, provoking Yi Tiao Cha to steal Zhang Luoshou's wheat. As a result, Zhang Qing saw it. Zhang Qing patiently educated him and asked him to tell the truth. When he went home and thought about it, he decided to go to Zhang Qing and confess the bad things he had done. Before he left home, Cai Bingjun came in with a knife, threatening him not to confess, but to pretend to confess, and let him lead Zhang Qing to the outside of the village, attempting to kill Zhang Qing. But Yi Tiao Cha was no longer fooled by the special agents, and finally confessed to Zhang Qing. At the same time, the masses also reported to the village cadres the situation of the special agents threatening Yi Tiao Cha. Based on these materials, the village cadres confirmed that Huang Jinkui and other bandits and agents were indeed carrying out sabotage activities, and finally arrested these hidden enemy agents based on the instructions of the county.
    The audience who watched this play received a lot of education. Especially when American imperialism invaded the Korean people and approached our country's door, the educational significance of this play became even greater, and people understood it even more deeply. It made us more deeply aware of the hideous faces of the enemy agents. These hidden enemy agents are expecting the Third World War to break out, and expecting the small group of Chiang bandits remaining in Taiwan to return. They believe that this will be the time for them to stand on the people's heads again. Huang Shaokui, an enemy agent in the play, said: "The Communist Party is dedicated to production and construction, and we have to sabotage it first. When the Third World War breaks out, hey! Aren't we afraid of turning things around?!" What did they want to turn around? Huang Jinkui said this to his bandits: "The land lying in this village and the houses standing, I still have to make them surnamed Huang!"
    From this play, we can clearly see: the harm to the people's cause caused by the thought of peaceful complacency and the disunity of cadres; we can also clearly see how the hidden enemy agents provoke the relationship between cadres and the masses, and how they take advantage of loopholes to carry out sabotage. The special agents took advantage of the shortcomings of the new cadre Zhang Fulu, who was afraid to take responsibility, and the peaceful complacency of the director of the Farmers' Association and some people, and took advantage of the fact that the director of the Armed Forces Committee, Li Zhijiang, was simple-minded and liked to argue with people, to provoke the cadres to disunite. As a result, both new and old cadres were unwilling to work actively, and the enemy agents seized this opportunity to sabotage production. These facts profoundly educated the village cadres, and at the same time, educated every audience member. People like Wang Lober, the director of the Farmers' Association, Li Zhijiang, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, and Zhang Fulu, the new village chief, all painfully reviewed themselves. When the director of the Armed Forces Committee reviewed himself and thought that the landlord Huang Jinkui was carrying a net to fish every day was keeping to his duty, Wang Lober was so angry that he said: "Duty! Duty! You are the fish in his net!" This is very profound.
    What moved the audience the most was the Communist Party branch secretary and security officer Zhang Qing's careful and responsible attitude towards work, and his mass line work style. He mingled with the people of the whole village, patiently listened to the opinions of the masses, carefully studied the enemy agents' activities, helped the lazy man Yi Tiao Cha, who was deceived by the enemy agents, confess his mistakes, and helped Zhang Luoshou realize his error in thinking: in this day and age, as long as the fire doesn't burn his eyebrows, isn't it just eating, working, working, eating, and launched a mass anti-espionage and anti-special agent movement. So that the hidden enemy agents finally revealed their true colors in front of the broad masses.

    话剧《不拿枪的敌人》观后
    朱波
    最近，新生剧团在北京剧院演出的三幕九场话剧《不拿枪的敌人》，是一个具有很大教育意义的剧本。这不是一个虚构的故事，而是真实的情况。
    当我们在全国范围取得胜利后，在一部分干部中，滋长着一种和平麻痹的思想，认为全国胜利了，蒋介石匪帮的八百多万匪军都被我们消灭了，还怕什么，安安稳稳地过日子吧。但是，他们忘记了暗藏在各地不拿枪的敌人，还在美帝、蒋匪的唆使下，利用我们工作中的空隙，以武装的、非武装的各式各样的方法，作垂死的挣扎。想尽一切办法，来破坏我们国家的生产建设，破坏人民的幸福日子。《不拿枪的敌人》就是揭露敌特这种罪恶的一个故事。
    这是描写华北老区一个村庄进行反特斗争的故事。平、津解放后，特务兼还乡地主黄金魁回到村里，以终日打鱼作幌子，来掩护他的阴谋活动。他的儿子黄少魁，是一个散兵游勇兼蒋匪特务，经常和天津暗藏的敌特取联系，取得台湾蒋匪残余的指示。利用“破鞋”八凑娘开设一杂货铺，作为特务们秘密集会的场所。勾结了曾因当伪保长被群众斗争的蔡秉钧，黄金魁并以自己的儿媳妇勾搭上了二流子苏洛尖，一同进行种种阴谋活动。
    中共村支部书记、治安员张清，到县里开会去了，剩下的几个村干部互相不团结。新任村长张福禄，对工作不敢大胆负责，武委会主任李治江带有很严重的强迫命令作风，遇事不加思考，盲动，对人好抱成见。农会主任王洛伯，一脑子和平麻痹的思想，认为现在全国胜利了，平平安安的过时光吧。另外，也有少数群众，抱着“各扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”的态度。这样，就给了敌特、还乡地主等进行破坏活动的空隙。
    敌特先拉拢懒汉一条叉赌博，想借此拉一条叉下水，进而计划放火烧群众的麦子。他们的计划是：由黄少魁去烧麦子，苏洛尖假装好人，给村干部来个假报告，说是一条叉放的火，由蔡秉钧负责把一条叉引到村边上，好叫村干部捉住。就这样，敌特的阴谋实现了。
    当支部书记、治安员张清从县里回来，看到这种情况以后，先领导着村干部进行了对工作的检讨，指出了村干部闹不团结，给了坏人进行破坏的机会。除奸小组的洛忠大伯及石头他奶奶等翻身农民，详细的汇报了黄金魁等匪特怎样拉拢一条叉以及利用八凑娘开杂货铺掩护特务活动的情形。使张清知道了放火的不是一条叉，就是一条叉放的火，也是由黄金魁等主使的。张清一方面布置积极分子，监视坏分子的活动，另一方面深入群众中，进一步了解情况。特务知道一条叉没有被扣，又故意在一条叉面前说张洛守知道放火的人，挑唆一条叉去偷割张洛守的麦子。结果被张清看见了。张清耐心的对他进行了教育，要他说实话。他回家一想，决心去找张清，坦白他作的坏事情，他还没有出家门，蔡秉钧拿着刀子进来了，威胁他不准坦白，只能假装坦白，让他把张清引到村外，企图杀害张清。但是一条叉没有再上特务的当，终于向张清坦白了。同时，群众也向村干部报告了特务威胁一条叉的情况。村干部根据这些材料，证实了黄金魁等匪特确在进行破坏活动，最后根据县里的指示把这些暗藏的敌特逮捕了。
    看过这幕剧的观众，都得到了很多的教育。特别当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜人民，并逼近我国门口的时候，这个剧的教育意义就更大，人们领会得就会更深刻。它使我们更深刻的认识到敌特的狰狞面目。这些暗藏的敌特正在期望着第三次世界大战起来，期望着台湾那一小撮蒋匪残余回来。他们认为这将是他们重新站在人民头上的时候。剧中敌特黄少魁说：“共产党专来讲生产建设，咱们就得先破坏着，等第三次世界大战一起，嘿！还怕翻不过把来？！”他们翻什么把呢？黄金魁对他的匪徒是这样说的：“这村里躺着的土地，立着的房子，我还得叫它们姓黄！”
    从这幕剧中，我们很清楚地看到：和平麻痹的思想，以及干部闹不团结所给予人民事业的危害；我们也清楚的看到暗藏的敌特是怎样的挑拨干部、群众的关系，而又怎样的钻空子进行破坏。特务分子利用了新干部张福禄不敢负责的缺点及农会主任和一部分人的和平麻痹思想，并利用武委会主任李治江头脑简单，好和人闹意见的毛病，挑拨干部互不团结。以至使新老干部都不愿意积极工作了，敌特便抓紧这样的机会，对生产进行了破坏。这些事实，都深刻的教育了村干部，同时，也教育了每一个观众，像农会主任王洛伯、武委会主任李治江、新村长张福禄等，都沉痛的检讨了自己。当武委会主任检讨自己认为地主黄金魁天天提着网打鱼是守本分时，气得王洛伯说：“本分！本分！你就是人家网兜里的鱼！”这是很深刻的。
    最使观众感动的，是中共支部书记、治安员张清对工作细心负责的态度，及他的群众路线的工作作风。他和全村群众打成一片，耐心地听取群众的意见，并细心地研究敌特活动的情况，帮助受敌特欺骗的懒汉一条叉坦白出自己的错误，并帮助张洛守认识了自己认为：这年头只要火烧不到自己的眉毛尖上，还不是吃饭、做活、做活、吃饭的错误思想，开展起群众性的除奸防特运动。使暗藏的敌特，终于在广大群众面前，现出了原形。
