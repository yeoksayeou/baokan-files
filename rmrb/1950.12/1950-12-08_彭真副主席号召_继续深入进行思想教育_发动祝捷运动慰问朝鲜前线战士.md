Form an Even More Consolidated Anti-Imperialist United Front!

    Vice Chairman Peng Zhen Calls for
    Continuing to Deepen Ideological Education
    Launching a Victory Celebration Movement to Console the Korean Frontline Soldiers
    Finally, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen spoke.
    He pointed out that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has become a widespread mass movement, pro-American ideas have suffered a serious blow, and the erroneous psychology of fearing America has also been largely eliminated. The current central task should be to continue to eliminate the influence of American imperialism in China and further eliminate the fear of America in order to raise the masses' understanding of the essence of imperialism. Therefore, propaganda work should continue to be carried out in depth in all strata and regions. In conjunction with the deepening of the movement, all localities should further improve the work of preventing traitors and spies to prevent the enemy from sabotaging our various work and construction undertakings.
    He also explained several specific work issues in the movement:
    (1) The masses in various places continue to sign up for the Volunteer Army. The local branches should uniformly register them and submit them to the General Association. They should be called upon to continue to study and work peacefully at present, and some can be mobilized to participate in various military cadre schools.
    (2) Various places have received a lot of donations and慰勞品, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various places, and it has indeed greatly encouraged the frontline soldiers. However, we should advise the people in various places to donate money and慰勞品 entirely within their capacity and should never force it. Some workers and students are very enthusiastic and donate some of their only daily necessities, which is unnecessary. Some should explain the reason and return them.慰勞品 letters are also very encouraging to the frontline soldiers and can be widely mobilized.
    (3) In order to celebrate the great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, various localities can launch various victory celebration movements. All condolence or victory celebration telegrams sent by various localities to the front should be submitted to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression for forwarding to the front or publishing in newspapers.

    彭真副主席号召
    继续深入进行思想教育
    发动祝捷运动慰问朝鲜前线战士
    最后，彭真副主席讲话。
    他指出抗美援朝运动已经成为广泛的群众运动，亲美思想已遭受了严重的打击，恐美的错误心理也清除了很多。当前的中心工作应是继续肃清美帝在中国的影响，进一步清除恐美思想，以提高群众对帝国主义本质的认识。因此应该在各阶层各地区继续深入展开宣传工作。各地结合运动的深入，应进一步作好防奸防特的工作，以防敌人对我各种工作和建设事业的破坏。
    他并对运动中的几个具体工作问题做了说明：
    （１）各地群众继续不断报名参加志愿军，应由各地分会统一进行登记，呈报总会。应号召他们在目前仍安心读书工作，并可动员一部分参加各种军事干部学校。
    （２）各地都已收到很多捐款和慰劳品，这表示了各地人民的爱国热情，对前方战士也确实起了很大的鼓舞作用。但我们应劝告各地人民在捐献款项和慰劳品时应该完全量力而为，绝对不应勉强，有的工人学生热情很高，把仅有的一些日常必需用品都捐献出来，这是不必要的。有的应该说明原因，退回给他们。慰劳信对前方将士的鼓舞使用也很大，可以广泛发动。
    （３）为了庆贺朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的巨大胜利，各地可发动各种祝捷运动。所有各地发给前方的慰问或祝捷电文统交中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会寄发前方或在报上发表。
