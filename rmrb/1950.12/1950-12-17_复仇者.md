    The Avengers
    (By M. Isakovsky, translated by Qiu Qin and Liu Guangjie)
    Countless days have passed,
    But this day, no one can forget...
    Even the pine trees are sadly turning white,
    The stones by the road are weeping.
    When houses burned in the great fire,
    And corpses were hanging everywhere,
    When children lay on the road, stabbed by bayonets—
    How can this be forgotten?
    How can this be forgotten—
    When that blind old man
    Was ripped apart alive between two tanks
    By those wild and savage beasts.
    Cannot forget! We will not forget.
    We will never forgive the murdering thugs.
    We don't need to hear the assembly call,
    Everyone has already gathered on their own.
    We gather under the old oak tree,
    To ask the elders for advice.
    They said: Don't allow those pests
    To live on this earth!
    Under the beloved Belarusian sky,
    We swear for the dead and the living,
    And that very night, we killed the enemy sentries,
    Writing this record into the book of revenge.
    Since then, we have killed countless murderers—
    They have all found their eternal resting place!
    Death is quietly waiting everywhere,
    But they themselves are still unaware.
    Death awaits them in the fields and forests,
    Death is watching behind every thicket,
    It explodes bridges at the ferry crossings,
    It causes trains to overturn into the river.
    Count them, see how many German dogs
    It mows down with its machine guns?
    It leads them into the muddy swamps—
    Never to return.
    It leads them into houses to spend the night,
    Gives them wine to quench their thirst, lets them sleep peacefully in bed;
    But when the sun rises again in the morning,
    Not a single one can get out of bed.
    We vow: In the summer heat and in the bitter cold,
    Not to give the enemy a moment's respite.
    We vow: As long as one enemy remains alive,
    We will never lay down our weapons!
    We will never lose face,
    We will never forget the glory of battle—
    Our club of revenge
    Swings day and night over the enemy's head.
                            1942

    复仇者
    （Ｍ·伊萨可夫斯基作丘琴刘光杰合译）
    数不清的日子都已逝去，
    这一天，可是谁也不能忘记……
    就连那松树也悲伤得白了头发，
    路旁的石头也在哭泣。
    当家屋在大火中燃烧，
    到处都吊荡着被绞死的尸体，
    当孩子们横卧在路上被刺刀扎死——
    这怎么能忘记？
    这怎么能忘记——
    当那瞎了眼睛的老爷子
    被那些野性发作的生番们
    绑在两辆坦克的中间活活地分尸。
    不能忘记！我们也不会忘记。
    对杀人的凶手我们绝不饶恕。
    我们不必听集合的号音，
    大家早就自动地集合在一起。
    我们集合在老橡树下，
    向那些老年人讨问个主意。
    他们说：不许那些害人虫
    生存在大地！
    在亲爱的白俄罗斯的天空下，
    我们为那已死的和活着的人宣誓，
    并且就在当夜杀死了敌人的哨兵，
    用这个记录写进复仇的书里。
    从那时起，我们打死了无数凶犯——
    他们都找到了自己永世的归宿！
    到处都有死亡在悄悄地等候，
    可是，他们自己却还不知。
    死亡在田野和林中将他们等候，
    每一堆丛树后都有死亡在监视，
    它在渡口爆炸桥梁，
    它使火车翻到河里。
    你数一数看，它用机关枪突突着
    打死了多少德国狗？
    它把他们引进烂泥洼子里——
    一去永不回头。
    它把他们引进房里去过夜，
    给他们酒渴，让他们在床上安睡；
    当太阳又在早晨升腾起来的时候，
    可就再没有一个人能从床上爬起。
    我们发誓：在夏日的炎热中，在严寒里，
    不让敌人有一刹时的喘息。
    我们发誓：只要还有一个敌人活着
    我们就绝不放下武器！
    我们决不丢脸，
    我们决不忘记战斗的光荣——
    我们复仇的棍棒
    日日夜夜地挥动在敌人的头顶。
                            一九四二年
