To the Editor:

In the recent wheat seed loan program in Baoding Prefecture, the People's Bank of Baoding Prefecture branch signed contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives and grain companies, selecting the best wheat seeds (with a germination rate of over 90%). As a result, the wheat seedlings in the area are generally robust this year. However, the fertilizer loans were skewed. For example, farmers in Xushui were severely short of fertilizer, yet the Xushui branch loaned the entire fertilizer loan of 100.73 million yuan to 24 merchants. The Wangdu branch also loaned 150 million yuan to four merchants. This allowed merchants to control the fertilizer market. The price of fertilizer in Wangdu once rose to 95,000 yuan per hundred jin, equivalent to more than six dou of wheat, causing significant losses for farmers. The Wanxian branch did not lend a single jin of fertilizer to farmers, instead lending 120 million yuan to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative transported 200,000 jin of fertilizer from Tianjin and sold it below market prices, but farmers who urgently needed fertilizer but could not afford to buy it still could not benefit. Only a portion of relatively wealthy farmers benefited.

Secondly, the inability to grasp the season in this loan program led to the accumulation of funds and delayed agricultural timing. For example, when the Xincheng branch issued fertilizer loans, farmers had already started planting wheat, resulting in only 31,000 jin being loaned out, with the majority remaining unloaned and accumulated. The Tangxian branch only issued livestock loans in the autumn, resulting in only 44 out of 100 livestock loan targets being completed. There were also instances of blind lending in some areas. For example, Yi County allocated loans to areas that did not lack livestock, resulting in the loans not being issued, while areas lacking livestock requested loans but were unable to obtain them. In Mancheng, many households that received livestock loans did not use them to buy livestock.

Loan programs require extremely meticulous investigation and organization. Without this step, skewing is inevitable. These lessons should be noted by all regions, and it is hoped that the departments responsible for this work in the aforementioned areas will conduct thorough investigations.

### 保定专区农贷发生偏向有关部门应彻底进行检查

    保定专区农贷发生偏向有关部门应彻底进行检查编辑同志：
    保定专区人民银行办事处在这次麦种贷款中，因为与供销社、粮食公司订立了合同，所以选择了最好的麦种（发芽率在百分之九十以上），因之当地今年麦苗大都很肥壮。但在肥料的贷款中，却发生了偏向。如徐水农民肥料很缺乏，徐水支行却将整个肥料贷款一亿零七百三十万元贷给了二十四户商人。望都支行也将一亿五千万元贷给了四户商人。这样使得商人掌握了肥料市场。望都肥料一度曾涨到每百斤九万五千元，折合小麦六斗多，农民吃亏很大。完县支行一斤肥料都没有贷给农民，而把一亿二千万元贷给了供销社。供销社由天津运来肥料二十万斤，低于市价出售，但迫切需要肥料而无力购买的农民，仍然不能受益。得到便宜的只是一部分比较富裕的农民。
    其次，在这次贷款中因为不能掌握季节，使资金积压和误了农时。像新城支行在贷肥时，农民已开始种麦了，结果只贷出了三万一千斤，大部则无法贷出而被积压着。唐县支行秋天才发放牲畜贷款，结果一百头牲畜的贷款任务，只完成了四十四头。还有些地方发生了盲目贷款的情形。如易县把贷款分配给不缺牲畜的地方，结果贷不出去，缺牲畜的地方要求贷款，而未能贷到。满城发出的牲畜贷款，不少户却没有拿去买牲口。
    贷款是一个极为细致的调查和组织工作，没有这一步工作，必然发生偏向，这些教训应引起各地的注意并希望上述地区负责这个工作的部门进行彻底检查。
