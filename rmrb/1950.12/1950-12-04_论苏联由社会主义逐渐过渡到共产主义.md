    On the Gradual Transition from Socialism to Communism in the Soviet Union
    Yu Jin, Doctor of Philosophy, Soviet Union
    A socialist society has been built in the Soviet Union. All the main principles of socialism have been realized: the private ownership of the means of production has been eliminated; all the natural wealth of the country – land, forests, watercourses, mineral deposits, all large and small factories, railways and other means of transportation, banks, etc., all cultural facilities – theaters, cinemas, museums, major, secondary and primary schools, research institutes, newspapers, publishing businesses, radio – all of this belongs to the people and is the socialist public property.
    In the Soviet Union, based on the elimination of private ownership of the means of production, all exploiting classes in urban and rural areas have been completely eradicated, and the exploitation of man by man has been eliminated. In the Soviet Union, no one occupies the labor of others, and no one gets rich by relying on the labor of others. Everything that the working people create and produce belongs to themselves: part of the labor is used for the needs of society and the state, and the rest is for the personal enjoyment of the laborers. Every citizen of the Soviet Union is rewarded according to the quality and quantity of their labor.
    Socialism has opened up unlimited possibilities for the development of productive forces. Never before in human history has the material production and culture of the people developed so vigorously.
    Socialism is only the first stage of communism. This stage indicates that communist society has not yet fully unfolded, and all the possibilities and advantages of the communist mode of production have not yet been utilized. All the great constructions of communism, all the material and cultural welfare of the working people, will emerge like a torrent with the transition to communism, and will create everything necessary for affluent, well-rounded and cultured people.
    In the Soviet Union, socialism has reached the stage of development where it is beginning to transition to communism.
    The theory of scientific communism was established by Marx and Engels more than a hundred years ago. Lenin and Stalin comprehensively developed this theory based on the summary of new experiences in the struggle of the international proletariat, especially based on the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.
  I. The Two Stages of Communist Society
  Socialism and communism are two stages of the economic maturity of the new society.
    In 1875, Marx first stipulated the principle of the two stages of communism in his "Critique of the Gotha Program." He scientifically demonstrated that socialism and communism are two stages of development, two stages of the same communist socio-economic formation.
    No social system appears in a ready-made, ultimate form, but has its history of development from a lower stage to a higher stage. Communism, as a social system, also has successive stages of maturity and development. The development of communism goes through two stages – a lower stage and a higher stage.
    The lower stage of communist development is socialism, and the higher stage is complete, developed communism. Lenin wrote on this point: "What is usually called socialism was named by Marx the 'first' or lower stage of communism. Since the means of production have become common property, the word 'communism' is also applicable here, if one does not forget that this is not complete communism, ... In its first stage, communism cannot yet be fully mature economically; it cannot be completely free from traditions or traces of capitalism" (Lenin, "State and Revolution," Liberation Press Edition, pp. 123, 124).
    Socialism is a society that has just emerged from the womb of capitalism. Therefore, in many aspects – economically, in daily life, and in people's consciousness – it still retains many birthmarks, traces, and remnants of the old system. Marx wrote when explaining the characteristics of socialism: "What we have here is not a communist society which has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, one just emerging from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges" (Marx, "Critique of the Gotha Program," p. 11).
    Communism is different. It is a higher stage in the development of the new society, at which time the remnants of capitalism have been eradicated, both economically and in people's consciousness. The higher stage of communism can be said to be a society that develops not by inheriting the heritage of the past but on the basis of its own production and culture created by socialism. Marx explained the characteristics of the higher stage of communism in "Critique of the Gotha Program": "In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life’s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly – only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!" (See Marx, "Critique of the Gotha Program").
    From these characteristics, it can be seen that the difference between socialism and communism is caused by the difference in the degree of economic maturity of the new society.
    Marx and Engels correctly and completely solved these problems based on the problems of the working class struggle raised in the course of life. Their purpose was not to describe in detail what a socialist society and a communist society would be like. They foresaw and demonstrated the inevitable arrival of the new society and made a brilliant exposition of the most general characteristics of this new society and its two stages of development.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union are the greatest victories of the theory of scientific communism, the theory of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism. The social system that has been established in the Soviet Union, the socialist system, is the first stage of communism.
    Lenin and Stalin further formulated the theory of scientific communism based on the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, making the definitions of the characteristics of socialism and communism more accurate and specific, and they discovered the road from socialism to communism.
    The socialist system that actually exists in the Soviet Union has received the most correct and scientific analysis in the works of Comrade Stalin.
  The Commonality of Socialist and Communist Foundations
    Since socialism and communism are two stages of the same socio-economic formation, they have a common foundation and characteristics shared by both stages.
    Socialism and communism – this is the same mode of production. This mode of production has been established in the Soviet Union, and it is based on the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and the establishment of social public ownership, the eradication of all exploiting classes, and the elimination of the exploitation of man by man.
    In the Soviet Union, the means of production are combined with the laborers, that is, with all producers of material goods. This has eliminated the antagonism between productive forces and production relations that has existed for centuries. Between the laborers and the means of production, there are no longer exploiters – private owners of the means of production: slave owners, feudal lords, capitalists.
    Marx had the genius to foresee that the bourgeois production relations are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production. This antagonism does not arise from production being inherently hostile, but from the special social conditions of production based on private ownership of the means of production. Capitalism establishes the preconditions for eliminating this antagonism, and socialism eliminates this antagonism.
    Marx's ideas are expressed in general theories, like algebraic formulas. Comrade Stalin revealed this formula, made it concrete, and filled it with the new content of the new relationship between productive forces and production relations in socialist and communist societies.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the production relations in the Soviet Union are fully suitable for the nature of the productive forces because here, public ownership of the means of production is fully suitable for the social nature of the production process.
    Comrade Stalin, in summarizing the experience of socialist construction in the above-mentioned principle, gave the definition to the new basic law of the communist socio-economic formation. In the complete suitability between productive forces and production relations, that is, in the new type of mutual relationship between them, in their dialectical unity, lies the inexhaustible possibility of developing the productive forces of socialist and communist societies.
    Due to the dominance of public ownership of the means of production and the complete suitability of production relations to the nature of productive forces, it is possible for a large country to carry out all economic construction in a planned and rational manner, to fully utilize all the material and spiritual forces of Soviet society, and to utilize all the achievements of science and technology to promote the development of production. For the first time in history, production and science are not spontaneously combined but are combined in a planned and rational manner, so that science completely serves the interests of production, that is, the interests of the laborers themselves and the interests of the entire people. This is also an important factor in the increasingly accelerated development of productive forces and the entire society. This planned leadership of the national economy is also a characteristic shared by socialism and communism.
    Engels wrote in his famous book "Anti-Dühring" that under the capitalist system, the social forces created by people, due to the anarchic nature of bourgeois society, rule people like natural magic, causing them terrible disasters like invisible forces, and thoroughly shaking people's lives. These spontaneous forces of capitalist society manifest themselves in unemployment, in the bankruptcy of millions of peasants, handicraftsmen and small merchants, in destructive economic crises, and in wars that kill millions of people, especially in the era of imperialism.
    Engels wrote that with the victory of socialism, these seemingly strange magic powers will be controlled by people, the development of production will take on a planned and rational nature, people will foresee the results of their labor, productive forces will continue to develop, and gradually guarantee the prosperity of culture and social material welfare.
    In the Soviet Union, the principle of implementing a planned economy has achieved complete victory. Soviet socialist society has been freed from the effects of the spontaneous laws of social development. In the Soviet Union, the historical change from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom has been completed. The previous history of mankind has ended, and the true history of mankind freed from slavery and exploitation has begun.
    With the victory of socialism, the political and moral unity of the entire society has been established, people's customs and views have undergone extremely profound changes, and the new socialist consciousness has gained an overwhelming advantage. The Soviet socialist ideology (Marxism-Leninism), which dominates in the Soviet Union, will also be the completely dominant ideology under communism. It will completely eradicate the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. Therefore, socialism not only lays the economic foundation for communism but also lays the ideological foundation for communism. This is also where the commonality of the fundamental foundations of socialism and communism is manifested.
  The Basic Differences Between Socialism and Communism
    The difference between socialism and communism is primarily determined by the different degrees of development of the modes of production that constitute these two societies.
    The economic foundation of communist society will be the socialist mode of production that has been established, exists, and is irresistibly moving forward. This mode of production will be developed to the highest level and will finally get rid of the traces and birthmarks of the old system.
    Under communism, social productive forces will achieve a high degree of prosperity, resulting in the creation of a variety of affluent products and consumer goods. Technological progress will inevitably advance rapidly and reach such a level of perfection that extremely profound revolutions will occur in all aspects of production technology. All production processes will be mechanized and automated. All the most advanced sources of raw materials and sources of power will be used to serve society. The electrification, gasification, jet technology, and atomic energy of various departments of the national economy will also be fully utilized to serve mankind. In our country, this technology suitable for communism is being successfully created. It is enough to point out the comprehensive progress of Soviet technology and its main trends to prove this. For example, the mechanization of labor, the automation of production, the electrification of all production processes, the chemicalization of many industrial and agricultural sectors, the manufacture of many new and more powerful machines, new communication equipment, etc.
    Communist society, based on the highest degree of development of productive forces, will eliminate all capitalist remnants in the economy, including the elimination of the opposition between urban and rural areas and the opposition between mental and physical labor inherited from class society.
    In line with the development and changes of productive forces, production relations will also move forward, and the forms of public ownership will also tend to be perfected. At present, in the Soviet Union, there are still remnants of small private property of individual farmers and family handicraftsmen who have not joined cooperatives, which also proves that socialist construction has not been finally completed, but these remnants will inevitably disappear. If under socialism, the socio-economic foundation is two forms of public ownership, namely state ownership and collective farm-cooperative ownership, then under communism it will be a single, national, communist ownership of the means of production.
    Therefore, the transition from socialism to communism is based on the further development of public ownership, which will mean the final completion of the process of socialization of the means of production.
    Therefore, under communism, class differences that still exist in the socialist stage will also be eliminated. Under socialism, there are still class differences between the working class and the peasantry. National socialist ownership constitutes the conditions for the existence of the working class, while the cooperative (labor union, collective farm) form of ownership constitutes the conditions for the existence of collective farmers. Other social classes do not exist in the Soviet Union.
    The working class and the peasantry have a common material foundation – namely the socialist economy, although this economy exists in two different forms, which shows that the working class and collective farmers in the Soviet Union are classes that are close to each other. They both join the unified socialist economic system, and they are both developing towards communism.
    However, since there are not only commonalities but also differences between these two forms of socialist ownership, there are still class differences between the working class and the collective farmers. This difference is related to the fact that the opposition between urban and rural areas cannot be completely eliminated under socialism. The difference between the working class and the peasantry will gradually disappear with the final completion of socialist construction and the transition to communism.
    In addition to the working class and the peasantry, there are also Soviet socialist intellectuals who exist as a special social stratum in the Soviet Union. The Soviet intellectuals, according to their social nature, are close and cordial to the working class and the peasantry. They are the most educated and cultured part of Soviet society. They participate together with the workers and peasants in the common struggle to win the victory of communism.
    The existence of Soviet intellectuals as a special social stratum engaged in mental labor shows that there still exists the opposition between mental and physical labor that has been historically inherited from capitalism and has not yet been overcome. Under socialism, the process of overcoming this opposition is constantly ongoing, but it must be fully completed under communism.
    Based on the further development of the socialist mode of production, the method of distribution will also change with the transition from socialism to communism.
    Corresponding to the first stage of communism is the method of distribution according to labor. One of the main principles of socialism that has been realized in the Soviet Union is: everyone has the obligation to work to the best of their ability and has the right to be rewarded according to the quantity and quality of their labor.
    The new socialist combination of productive forces and production relations, the new combination of producers and means of production, the new production relations themselves, the new socialist relations, etc., also stipulate the progressive principle of labor remuneration in terms of its nature. Since the productive forces are in the hands of the producers who have been unified, there is no more exploitation, and all the products produced are subject to the society and the producers themselves who have been unified. This makes it possible to implement the socialist principle of each according to his ability and to each according to his work.
    This principle of labor remuneration, at the current stage of socialist development, best guarantees the combination of the public interests and personal interests of Soviet citizens, and it creates a stimulus for the development of productive forces that has never been seen in any previous socio-economic formation. It promotes the development of socialist competition and helps to discover all the talents of Soviet people in their activities in production technology, science, and culture.
    However, this method of distribution, despite its historical progressiveness, is not our ideal. It is constrained by the degree of production development reached under socialism and the degree of development of the producers of material goods themselves. When society reaches a higher stage of development, it will inevitably implement another method of distribution, that is, the method of distribution according to needs. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his book "Anarchism or Socialism?": "In the future society, free and harmonious labor should lead to equally harmonious and full satisfaction of all needs." "And this means: if the future society requires each of its members to contribute as much labor as he can, then it should, in turn, provide each person with as many products as he needs" (Stalin, "Anarchism or Socialism?" Liberation Press Edition, p. 58).
    If the principle of socialism is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," then the principle of communism is: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." This means that every citizen has full possibility to satisfy all the needs of cultured and educated people.
    Under communism, as under socialism, labor is the obligation of every able-bodied citizen, but there is an essential difference between socialism and communism. Under socialism, what motivates people to fulfill this obligation is economic necessity and regulations. Distribution according to labor motivates people to work, causing people to care about improving their labor productivity from the perspective of their personal material interests. The state strictly supervises the fulfillment of this obligation and strictly ensures that the labor volume and needs of each worker are fully matched. The Soviet Constitution expressly stipulates: "Labor in the Soviet Union is the obligation and glorious duty of every able-bodied citizen in accordance with the formula 'he who does not work, neither shall he eat'."
    Communism never abolishes the obligation to labor. On the contrary, communism is a society in which conscious labor discipline reaches the highest stage. But this discipline does not need to be forced. Lenin instructed that under communism, labor will become a habit, and a person's habit of voluntary labor will reach such a degree that labor will become his first need in life. Thus, there is no need for the amount of labor to be equal to the amount of consumption.
    Bourgeois writers have spent a lot of effort imagining communism as a kingdom of egalitarianism, in which it seems that everyone's appetite and needs are the same, and "barracks order" is established. This is just a thorough exposure of the ignorance of bourgeois ideology and its bestial hatred of communism.
    In fact, there is no and will not be egalitarianism either under socialism or under communism.
    The Marxist-Leninist principle of socialism shatters the petty-bourgeois concept that it seems that under socialism, everyone gets the same remuneration and the same guarantee. This concept is a caricature of socialism. Socialist equality is equality in the sense that class oppression has been eliminated, the working people have been freed from exploitation, and an equal relationship has been established with the means of production. However, socialism does not at all mean equal remuneration, because everyone is paid according to their labor, and the difference between skilled labor and unskilled labor, and between mental labor and physical labor, still exists.
    Under communism, these differences have been eliminated, "'crude' work and the distinction between 'fine' work, as well as the contradiction between mental and physical labor, are eliminated, labor is equal ......" (Stalin, "Anarchism or Socialism?" Liberation Press Edition, pp. 8, 9). However, this does not at all mean that people's needs are equal. In fact, this egalitarianism, even under communism, when society has implemented the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," will not exist. The food and other items that people receive will not be the same quantity, but different quantities that are suitable for their proper needs and their appetites. The needs of the citizens of communist society are the needs of well-rounded people, and these needs themselves are diverse. Comrade Stalin said when criticizing petty-bourgeois egalitarianism:
    "The equality understood by Marxism is not the average of personal needs and daily life, but the elimination of classes. That is to say: first, after overthrowing and expropriating the capitalists, all laborers are equally liberated from exploitation; second, after the means of production are transferred to public ownership by the whole society, the private ownership of the means of production is abolished equally for everyone; third, everyone has an equal obligation to work according to their ability, and all laborers have an equal right to receive labor remuneration according to their labor (socialist society); fourth, everyone has an equal obligation to work according to their ability, and all laborers have an equal right to receive labor remuneration according to their needs (communist society). At the same time, Marxism believes that everyone's appetite and needs, whether in terms of quality or quantity, will not be and cannot be the same and equal to each other, whether in the socialist period or the communist period." (Problems of Leninism, p. 624)
    These are the basic characteristics of socialism and communism.
    In 1927, Stalin, when explaining the general characteristics of communism, said: "If we were to make a simple dissection of communist society, then it would be a society where: (1) there will be no private ownership of the means of production and production materials, but only collective public ownership; (2) there will be no classes and state power, but only industrial and agricultural laborers who are united into a free association of laborers and jointly manage the economy; (3) the national economy organized according to plan, whether in industry or agriculture, will be based on the highest technology; (4) there will be no opposition between cities and villages, and between industry and agriculture; (5) the distribution of products will be in accordance with the principle of the old French communists: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs'; (6) science and art will be given full and smooth conditions so that they can achieve a full and flourishing prosperity; (7) everyone will become truly free because they do not have to worry about making a living and do not have to flatter the 'powerful in the world'" (Selected Works of Stalin, Vol. 3, Northeast Xinhua Bookstore Edition, p. 76). (⑵⑶)
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the disappearance of state power is one of the characteristics of communism, and what he explained is the characteristic of communism that has achieved complete victory, at least in many of the most important countries. If communism only exists in one country, if the capitalist encirclement still exists, then the state will still have to be retained under communism.
    When Comrade Stalin determined the characteristics of communism, he only pointed out its most important characteristics, and only pointed out those things that can be foreseen and scientifically judged. Attempting to predetermine all the details of the structure of communist society (for example, to determine in detail what daily life will be like under communism) is nothing but an ethereal fantasy.
    How the various details of communist society will be is a question to be solved by those descendants who will live in a developed communist society. At present, one thing is undeniable, that socialist society has been built in the Soviet Union. Socialism is developing forward. And this continued development of socialism also shows that it must inevitably transition to communism.
    Comrade Stalin theoretically demonstrated the possibility of building a complete communist society in one country, especially in a country like the Soviet Union. He pointed out that our country has everything necessary for this: such as the most advanced economic, social, and political system, and inexhaustible natural wealth. The socialist country has already practically started to solve this task. The socialist mode of production in the Soviet Union had already reached the stage of development of beginning to gradually transition to communism before the Second World War. The German attack on the Soviet Union temporarily interrupted this process. Currently, now that Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan have been defeated, the Soviet people are restoring the economy destroyed by the enemy, completing the construction of socialist society, and gradually transitioning to communism. The Soviet Union has grown stronger in the war. It is concentrating all its strength and accelerating its advance to complete socialist construction and gradually transition to communism.
  II. From Socialism to Communism
  Why is the Transition from Socialism to Communism Gradual?
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that once socialism begins to develop on its own economic foundation, it must inevitably grow to a higher stage, to communism.
    There is no insurmountable Great Wall of China between socialism and communism. Communism, as has been pointed out above, is only a more mature stage in the economic development of the new system.
    Since socialism and communism have a common economic foundation, the transition from the lower stage of communism to its higher stage also occurs gradually. This transition will be realized with the development of the national economy, the growth of labor productivity, the improvement of the masses' communist consciousness, and with the further consolidation of the strong strength of the Soviet state.
    It is necessary to understand why the transition from socialism to communism is gradual. Obviously, the transition from socialism to communism is gradual, which does not at all mean that the speed of progress is very slow. On the contrary, socialism greatly accelerates the development of society. Lenin once pointed out, "... the idea of socialism as something dead, rigid, eternally unchanging – which the bourgeoisie usually imagines – is infinitely false. In reality it is only with the achievement of socialism that there will commence a rapid, genuine, really mass forward movement, embracing first the majority and then the whole of the population, in all spheres of public and private life" (Lenin, "State and Revolution," Liberation Press Edition, p. 125). The experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union fully confirms these predictions of Lenin. The early completion of several Stalin five-year plans is a particularly brilliant proof of this.
    At the same time, it is also obvious that the transition from socialism to communism is gradual, which does not at all mean that there are no leaps in the development of individual aspects of social life, such as the development of production, the progress of technology and science, etc. Take the Stakhanov movement as an example. It makes us accelerate the development towards communism. In the words of Comrade Stalin, "It has a mission to carry out a revolution in our industry" (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism," Moscow Edition, p. 654). Similarly, there is no doubt that huge discoveries such as the application of atomic energy to production can and will cause a real technological revolution. This means that in the process of our society's development from socialism to communism, various leaps will of course occur. Our understanding of the gradual nature of this development should never be like the metaphysical evolutionists argue.
    The transition from socialism to communism is gradual, which means that this transition is not completed all at once, this is not a momentary action, not a social revolution. This also means that the nature of the process of transitioning from socialism to communism is completely different from the transition from capitalism to socialism. The transition from capitalism to socialism cannot be realized without a social revolution, because this is a transition from one socio-economic formation to another socio-economic formation, from one mode of production to another mode of production. The prerequisite for this transition is to forcibly eliminate the declining mode of production and to forcibly overthrow the declining class. In contrast, the transition from socialism to communism is a transition from one stage of development of the same socio-economic formation to another stage of development. Its realization is based on the same mode of production, and there is no need to overthrow any class. Its prerequisite is the gradual elimination of class boundaries. This transition does not require a social revolution and cannot be realized by momentary action. Lenin once pointed out that Marxists have never promised to "forcibly implement" communism, and this sentence is not without purpose. Communism grows out of socialism as society reaches a higher degree of economic development. The primary prerequisite for higher economic development is the further development of socialist productive forces.
  The Highest Development of Productive Forces is a Condition for Ensuring the Transition to Communism
    Marx and Engels wrote in the "Communist Manifesto" that the proletariat uses its political rule in order to "centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible" (Marx and Engels, "Communist Manifesto," Liberation Press Edition, p. 70).
    Marx and Engels believed that communism becomes possible when the development of productive forces reaches such a stage that all sources of social wealth gush out like a torrent.
    Marx and Engels could not more specifically determine the level of productive forces development necessary to build communism. Lenin has determined this level more specifically based on the experience of the Russian socialist revolution. He pointed out that it is necessary to catch up with and surpass developed capitalist countries economically and to create high labor productivity that is much higher than under capitalism.
    Lenin believed that the high level of productive forces development necessary for the transition to communism is closely linked to the planned implementation of electrification in all sectors of the national economy. From this, Lenin also derived a brilliant formula: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."
    Comrade Stalin developed the issue of the material preconditions for the transition to communism and solved this issue more specifically based on materials that Marx and Lenin did not have access to. In the history of Marxism, he was the first to specifically determine the level of productive forces development necessary to build communism in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin said at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in 1939, when explaining the great work plan for creating the material basis necessary to realize the transition from socialism to communism: "We have surpassed the major capitalist countries in terms of production technology and the speed of industrial development. This is of course very good. But this is not enough. It is also necessary to surpass them economically. We can do this, and we should do this. Only when we surpass the major capitalist countries economically can we hope that our country will have completely sufficient consumer goods and abundant food, and then we will be able to implement the transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage of communism" (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism," Moscow Edition, p. 757).
    In February 1946, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the productive forces of the Soviet Union must reach such a level that they can produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil per year. Other departments of the Soviet national economy should also be developed accordingly. Reaching this level means creating the necessary material basis for communism. To realize Stalin's plan, it is necessary to invest large amounts of new capital and build new industrial enterprises on the basis of increasingly improved technology.
    To judge how far the Soviet Union is from the level specified by this plan, we can cite the total industrial output that the Soviet Union will reach at the end of 1950 when the first post-war five-year plan is completed.
    When the first post-war five-year plan is completed, the production level of various important industrial sectors will reach the following quantities: about 20 million tons of pig iron, more than 25 million tons of steel, about 28 million tons of rolled steel, 250 million tons of coal, 35.4 million tons of oil, and 82 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.
    The growth rate of labor productivity in the Soviet Union has exceeded any time in history. During the five-year plan from 1946 to 1950, labor productivity increased by 36 percent compared to 1940.
    During this five-year plan period, the annual increase in output from the entire industry exceeded 160 billion rubles. How huge is this annual growth can be seen by comparing it with the previous situation. In the three years of the third five-year plan (pre-war), the annual increase in output was 143.16 billion rubles, the annual increase in the second five-year plan was 105 billion rubles, and the annual increase in the first five-year plan was only 55 billion rubles.
    All of this shows that when the post-war five-year plan is completed, the level of industrial production in the Soviet Union will increase by 50 percent as a whole compared to the pre-war 1940, and even more in some industrial sectors. For example, by the end of 1950, machines and mechanical equipment will be produced twice as much as before the war, the number of metal-cutting machines will increase to 1.3 million units, which means that it will exceed the total number of lathes in the United States in 1940 by about 30 percent, electricity production will increase by 70 percent, and coal mining will increase by more than 50 percent.
    Soviet industry not only has advantages over capitalist industry in terms of technology and development speed, but also in terms of its composition. In 1935, the proportion of machine manufacturing in the industrial production of the United States was 17.6 percent and in the United Kingdom it was 16.2 percent, while in the Soviet Union, machine manufacturing had already reached 25 percent by the end of the second five-year plan.
    During the post-war five-year plan period, Soviet agriculture also took a big step forward. In 1948, it reached the total harvest of grain before the war, and in terms of yield per hectare, it has exceeded the pre-war level. In 1949, 7.6 billion poods of grain were harvested, which is more than the most abundant year before the Second World War. The harvest in 1950 will exceed that of 1949 again. By the end of 1950, the total agricultural output will increase by 30 percent compared to 1940, and the annual grain harvest will reach 130 million tons.
    The following figures can give a clear concept of the growth of socialist agriculture in the first post-war five-year plan. If the production level of the total output in 1932 is taken as 100 percent, then it was 153 percent in 1937, 177 percent in 1940, and 225 percent in 1950.
    This is the advantage of socialism that guarantees the comprehensive and balanced development of industry and agriculture.
    The Soviet state greatly helps collective farms, invests a large amount of capital in agriculture, such as providing it with the latest technical equipment, chemical fertilizers, and ensuring that it is provided with trained technical and agronomic cadres. In the years of the post-war five-year plan, about 350,000 tractors and many other modern agricultural machines with very high productivity were invested in agriculture, and about 1,000 new agricultural machinery stations (MTC) were established.
    The electrification of agriculture and various productions related to agriculture is developing on an unprecedented scale. Calculated only by the small rural hydroelectric power stations under construction, the power generation is 1 million kilowatt-hours, which not only guarantees the electrification of agricultural machinery stations and state farms, but also guarantees the electrification of nearly one-third of the total number of collective farms. Many provinces have now been fully electrified. Agricultural electrification will be fully completed in the next few years.
    In the cause of further developing the productive forces of the socialist economy and creating abundant products necessary for the realization of communism, the Stalin plan to fight for a reliable bumper harvest, the afforestation and field protection plan, and a series of agricultural scientific measures such as the construction of reservoirs in the grassland area have extremely great significance. The implementation of the three-year plan for the development of animal husbandry formulated by the Soviet government in 1949 also serves the purpose of creating abundant food.
    The decision to build the Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka hydroelectric power stations and the construction of the Turkmen Canal, the South Ukraine, and the North Crimea canals have extremely great significance. These hydroelectric power stations and canals will be projects of decisive significance in the cause of creating the material basis of communism.
    The new hydroelectric power stations and canals will generate more than 200 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and will irrigate about 25 million hectares of grasslands, deserts, and dry and waterless areas. These few of the world's greatest projects, completed in five to six years, will greatly increase the productive forces of Soviet society, thereby greatly bringing our society closer to communism.
    The Soviet state pays special attention to the development of science. Soviet scholars are faced with the task of surpassing foreign scientific achievements in the near future. This task is completely competent for our scholars because they have the support of the Soviet socialist state, they have a large army of millions of Soviet intellectuals and all workers as their backing, and they also hold first-class research institutes and laboratories. The development of science will inevitably lead to new achievements in socialist technology.
    The large-scale development of the national economy can only be realized when the army of highly skilled engineers, technicians, and workers continues to grow. The following statistics illustrate the scale of this work of training new cadres. In 1950, there were more than 2 million people studying in higher and secondary technical schools, and about 2 million people have already graduated from these schools during the five-year plan. During the same period, the state reserve labor force training department trained 4.5 million young skilled workers. In addition, about 19 million workers

    论苏联由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义
    苏联哲学博士  尤金
    在苏联已经建成了社会主义社会。社会主义的一切主要原则均已实现：消灭了生产资料的私有制；国家的一切自然财富——土地，森林，水流，矿藏，一切大小工厂，铁路及其他各种交通工具，银行等等，一切文化设施，——剧院，电影院，博物馆，各大、中、小学，研究院，报纸，出版发行事业，无线电——所有这一切，均为人民所有，均为社会主义的公共财产。
    在苏联，在消灭了生产资料的私有制的基础上，完全肃清了城乡的各种剥削阶级，消灭了人对人的剥削。在苏联，没有人占有他人的劳动，没有人依靠他人劳动来发财致富。劳动人民所创造所生产出的一切，均为他们自己所有：一部分劳动用于社会的、国家的需要，其余部分则归劳动者个人享用。苏联的每一个公民均按其劳动的质和量取得报酬。
    社会主义为生产力的发展开辟了无限的可能，在人类历史上，人民的物质生产与文化，从来还没有过如此蓬勃的发展。
    社会主义，只是共产主义的第一个阶段。这一阶段说明，共产主义社会还没有充分展开，共产主义生产方式的一切可能性与优越性还没有被利用起来。共产主义的一切伟大建设，劳动人民的一切物质及文化福利，将随着过渡到共产主义而像洪流一般的涌现出来，并将创造出富足的、为全面发展的和有文化修养的人所必须的一切。
    在苏联社会主义已达到开始转入共产主义的发展阶段。
    科学共产主义理论，是马克思和恩格斯在一百多年前建立起来的。列宁、斯大林则根据对国际无产阶级新的斗争经验的总结，特别是根据苏联社会主义建设的经验，全面的发展了这一理论。
  一、共产主义社会的两个阶段
  社会主义和共产主义，是新社会经济成熟的两个阶段。
    一八七五年，马克思在《哥达纲领批判》一书中，第一次规定了关于共产主义的两个阶段的原则。他科学地论证了，社会主义和共产主义是两个发展阶段，是一个共产主义社会经济形态的两个阶段。
    任何社会制度，都不是以现成的，终极的形式出现的，而是有其由低级阶段发展到高级阶段的历史。共产主义，作为一种社会制度，同样有其成熟和发展的连续阶段。共产主义的发展要经过两个阶段——低级阶段和高级阶段。
    共产主义发展的低级阶段是社会主义，高级阶段是完全的、发达的共产主义。列宁曾就这一点写道：“通常所称的社会主义，马克思名之为共产主义的‘第一’阶段或低级阶段，既然生产资料已变为公共财产，那么‘共产主义’一语在此处也是可以应用的，如果不忘记这还不是完全的共产主义的话，……在其第一阶段上，共产主义还不能是在经济上已经完全成熟的，还不能是已完全摆脱资本主义的传统或痕迹的”（列宁：《国家与革命》，解放社版一二三，一二四页）。
    社会主义，是一个刚从资本主义内部脱胎而出的社会，因此，它在许多方面，在经济上、在日常生活上、在人们的意识上，依然保存着旧制度的许多斑痣、痕迹和残余。马克思在阐明社会主义的特征时写道：“我们这里所说的不是在自身基础上发展了的共产主义社会，而是刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来的；因此，在各方面，即在经济、道德和智慧方面，都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那旧社会痕迹的共产主义社会。”（马克思：《哥达纲领批判》十一页）
    共产主义与此不同，它是新社会发展的更高阶段，这时候无论在经济上或在人们的意识中，资本主义的残余均被肃清了。共产主义的高级阶段，可以说是这样一个社会，这个社会不是在继承过去的遗产而是在其为社会主义所创造的自己生产的和文化的基础上发展起来的。马克思在《哥达纲领批判》一书中阐明共产主义高级阶段的特征时写道：在共产主义社会高级阶段上，当那奴役人们迫使其服从社会分工的情形已经消失后；当智力劳动与体力劳动的对立已随之消失后；当劳动已经不单单是谋生的手段，而且本身已成为乐生的第一要素时；当生产力已随着每个人在各方面的发展而增高，一切公共财富泉源都尽量涌现出来时，——只有那时，才可把资产阶级式的法权的狭隘界限完全克服，而社会就能在自己的旗帜上写着：“各尽所能，各取所需”。（见马克思：《哥达纲领批判》一书）
    从这些特征当中，可以看出，社会主义与共产主义之间的区别，是由新社会的经济成熟程度之不同而造成的。
    马克思和恩格斯根据着生活进程中所提出的工人阶级斗争的问题，正确的完尽的科学地解决了这些问题。他们的目的，并不在于详尽说明，社会主义社会和共产主义社会将是一个什么样的社会。他们预见到了和论证了新的社会之必然到来，并对这个新社会的最一般的特征，以及它的发展的两个阶段，作了天才的阐明。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，以及苏联社会主义的建成乃是科学共产主义理论，马恩列斯理论的最伟大的胜利。在苏联业已建立起来的社会制度，社会主义的制度，是共产主义的第一个阶段。
    列宁和斯大林根据苏联社会主义建设的经验，进一步制订了科学共产主义的理论，使社会主义和共产主义诸特征的定义更加确切与具体，他们发现了由社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路。
    在苏联已实际存在的社会主义制度，在斯大林同志的著作中，获得了最正确、最科学的分析。
  社会主义基础与共产主义基础的共同性
    既然社会主义与共产主义是同一社会经济形态的两个阶段，那么，它们就有着共同的基础，有着为两个阶段所共有的特征。
    社会主义和共产主义——这是同一的生产方式。这种生产方式，在苏联已经建立起来了，它是以废除生产资料私有制和建立社会公有制，肃清一切剥削阶级和消灭人对人的剥削为前提的。
    在苏联，生产资料是与劳动者即与一切物质资料的生产者相结合的。从而就消灭了许多世纪以来的生产力与生产关系之间的对抗。在劳动者与生产资料之间再没有剥削者——生产资料的私有者：奴隶主、农奴主、资本家了。
    马克思曾天才的预见到，资产阶级的生产关系——这是社会生产过程的最后的一种对抗形式。这种对抗并非由于生产一般具有敌对性所产生的，而是由于以生产资料的私有为基础的生产的特殊社会条件所造成。资本主义为消灭这种对抗建立了前提，社会主义则消灭着这种对抗。
    马克思的思想，表现在一般理论的，好像代数的公式中。斯大林同志则揭发了这一公式，并使其具体化，以表现出社会主义社会与共产主义社会中生产力与生产关系间的新关系的新内容充实了它。
    斯大林同志指出，苏联的生产关系完全适合于生产力的性质，因为在这里，生产资料的公有制，是与生产过程的社会性质完全适合的。
    斯大林同志在上述这一原理中总结社会主义建设经验时，曾给了共产主义社会经济形态发表的新的基本规律以定义。在生产力与生产关系之间的完全相适合之中，即是在它们之间的新型的相互关系中，在它们的辩证的统一中，潜伏着使社会主义社会和共产主义社会的生产力得到发展的取之不尽，用之不竭的可能性。
    由于生产资料公有制的统治，由于生产关系完全适合于生产力的性质，这就使得一个大国可能按计划合理地进行一切经济建设，充分利用苏维埃社会的一切物质力量和精神力量，利用科学与技术的一切成就来促进生产的发展。历史上第一次生产与科学不是自发的，而是有计划地合理地结合起来，使科学完全为生产利益服务，即是为劳动者本身的利益，为全体人民的利益服务，这也是生产力和整个社会进步日益加速发展的重要因素。这种有计划的领导国民经济，也是社会主义与共产主义共有的特征。
    恩格斯在其《反杜林论》这一名著中写道，在资本主义制度下，人们所造成的社会力量，由于资产阶级社会的无政府性质之故，宛如自然魔力一样地统治着人们，有如人们所看不见的力量一样使他们遭到可怕的灾难，彻底震撼着人们的生活。资本主义社会的这些自发的力量表现为失业，表现为千百万农民、手工业者和小商人的破产，表现为破坏性的经济危机和使千百万人丧失生命的战争，特别是在帝国主义时代更为厉害。
    恩格斯写道，随着社会主义的胜利，这些看来是奇怪的魔力，即将为人们所控制，生产的发展将采取有计划地合理的性质，人们将预见到自己劳动的结果，生产力将不断发展，并逐步保证文化及社会物质福利的繁荣。
    在苏联，实行计划经济的原则，已经取得了完全的胜利。苏维埃社会主义社会已经摆脱了社会发展的自发的规律的作用。在苏联完成了由必然的王国到自由王国的历史突变。人类以往的历史结束了，摆脱了奴役与剥削的人类的真正的历史开始了。
    随着社会主义的胜利，建立了全社会政治上道义上的团结一致，人们的风俗习惯和观点发生了极深刻的变化，新的社会主义的意识占了压倒优势。在苏联占统治地位的苏维埃社会主义的思想体系（马列主义），在共产主义条件下亦将是完全占统治地位的思想体系。它将全部肃清人们意识中的资本主义残余。因此，社会主义不仅奠定共产主义的经济基础，而且奠定了共产主义的思想基础。社会主义与共产主义根本基础的共同性，也正表现在这一点上。
  社会主义与共产主义之间的基本差别
    社会主义与共产主义之间的差别，首先是由构成这两个社会之基础的生产方式的不同发展程度来决定的。
    构成共产主义社会的经济基础的，将是业已建立起来的，存在着的，不可抗拒地向前发展的社会主义的生产方式。这一生产方式将得到最高的发展，并最后摆脱旧制度的痕迹和斑痣。
    在共产主义条件下，社会生产力将要达到高度的繁荣，结果将创造出各种富足的产品和消费品。技术上的进步，必将迅速前进，并达到如此完善的程度，以至于在生产技术的各个方面，将发生极深刻的革命。一切生产过程都将走上机械化和自动化。一切最完善的原料来源和能力来源，均将被用来为社会服务。国民经济各部门的电气化，瓦斯化，喷射技术及原子能亦将被充分地利用来为人类服务。在我国，正顺利的创立着这种适合于共产主义的技术。只要指出苏联技术的全面进步及其主要趋势，就足以证明这一点。例如，劳动的机械化，生产的自动化，一切生产过程的电气化，许多工业和农业部门的化学化，许多新的马力更大的机器，新的通讯器材的制造等等。
    共产主义社会，以生产力最高度的发展为基础，将消灭经济上的一切资本主义残余，其中包括消灭从阶级社会继承下来的城乡对立和智力劳动与体力劳动的对立。
    与生产力的发展及变化相适应，生产关系亦将向前发展，公有制的形式亦将趋于完善。目前在苏联还存在着个体农民及未加入合作社的家庭手工业者的小私有财产残余，这也证明社会主义建设尚未最后完成，但这些残余必将消失。如果在社会主义条件下，社会经济基础是两种形式的公有制，即是国家所有制和集体农庄——合作社所有制，那么，在共产主义条件下就将是单一的，全民的，共产主义的生产资料所有制了。
    因此，由社会主义过渡到共产主义，是以公有制的进一步的发展为前提的，这一发展将意味着生产资料社会化过程的最后完成。
    因此，在共产主义条件下，在社会主义阶段还存在着的阶级差别亦将消灭。在社会主义条件下，在工人阶级与农民间，依然有着阶级的差别。全民的社会主义所有制，构成工人阶级存在的条件，合作社的（劳动组合的，集体农庄的）所有制形式，则构成了集体农民存在的条件。其它的社会阶级在苏联是不存在的。
    工人阶级和农民有着共同的物质基础——即社会主义的经济，虽然这种经济是以两种不同形式而存在的，这个事实说明，苏联的工人阶级和集体农民，是彼此亲近的阶级。他们都加入统一的社会主义的经济体系，他们都向着共产主义方面发展。
    但是既然在这两种社会主义所有制形式之间不仅有共同性，而且还有差别，那么，在工人阶级与集体农民之间，也就依然还存在着阶级的差别。这种差别是与在社会主义条件下还不能完全消灭城乡间的对立相联系的。工人阶级与农民之间的差别，将随着社会主义社会建设的最后完成，随着向共产主义的过渡而逐渐消失。
    除了工人阶级和农民而外，在苏联还有着作为特殊社会阶层而存在的苏维埃社会主义的知识分子。苏维埃的知识分子，按其社会本性来说，与工人阶级和农民是亲近的，亲切的。他们是苏维埃社会最有教养，最有文化的部分。他们同工人和农民一起参加争取共产主义胜利的共同斗争。
    苏维埃知识分子作为一个从事智力劳动的特殊社会阶层而存在，是表现着还存在有历史上由资本主义继存下来的，至今尚未被克服的智力劳动与体力劳动之间的对立。在社会主义条件下，克服这种对立的过程是不断在进行的，但须在共产主义条件下才能全部完成。
    在社会主义的生产方式进一步发展的基础上，分配方法亦将随着由社会主义向共产主义的过渡而起变化。
    与共产主义第一阶段相适应的，是按劳分配的方法。在苏联业已实现的社会主义主要原则之一是：每人有义务尽其所能地劳动，并有权按其劳动的数量和质量取得报酬。
    生产力与生产关系的新型的社会主义的结合，生产者与生产资料的新型的结合，新型的生产关系本身，新型的社会主义关系等等，也规定了按其性质来讲是进步的劳动报酬原则。既然生产力是掌握在业已统一起来的生产者手里，就再没有剥削的现象，一切所生产出来的产品均受社会及业已统一起来的生产者自己支配。这就使得有可能实行各尽所能、按劳取酬的社会主义原则。
    这一劳动报酬原则，在社会主义发展的现阶段，最好的保证苏联公民的公共利益与个人利益的结合，它为生产力的发展创造着为以往任何社会经济形态所没有过的刺激力。它促进社会主义竞赛的发展，并有助于发现苏维埃人们在生产技术、科学、文化各方面活动中的一切天才。
    然而，这一分配方法，虽有其历史的进步性，但还不是我们的理想。它是为社会主义条件下所达到的生产发展程度，以及物质资料的生产者本身发展的程度所制约的。当社会达到更高的发展阶段时，它必将实行另一种分配方法，即各取所需的分配方法。斯大林同志在其《无政府主义还是社会主义？》一书中指出：在未来的社会中，自由与协合的劳动应引起在一切的需要上得到同样协合而充分的满足。“而这表示着：如果将来社会向其每个成员要求他所能贡献的那么多的劳动，那么它转而应当供给每个人以他所需要的那么多生产品”（斯大林：《无政府主义还是社会主义？》解放社版五八页）。
    如果社会主义的原则是“各尽所能，按劳取酬”，那么，共产主义的原则是：“各尽所能，各取所需”。这表示着，每一个公民都有充分可能来满足有文化有修养的人的一切需要。
    在共产主义条件下，犹如在社会主义条件下一样，劳动是每一个有工作能力的公民的义务，然而在社会主义与共产主义之间，却有着本质上的区别，在社会主义条件下，推动着人们来履行这一义务，是经济的必要和法规。按劳分配，激励着人们去劳动，引起人们从个人物质利益上去关心提高自己的劳动生产率。国家严格监督对这一义务的履行，严格地使每一个工作人员的劳动量与需要量完全适合。在苏联宪法里明文规定着：“劳动在苏联是每个有工作能力公民按‘不劳动者不得食’这一公式履行的义务和光荣职责”。
    共产主义绝不废除劳动的义务。相反的，共产主义是自觉的劳动纪律达到最高阶段的社会。但是这种纪律已不需要强迫。列宁指示说：在共产主义条件下，劳动将成为一种习惯，一个人之习惯于自愿劳动，会达到这种程度，以至于劳动将成为他的第一个生活需要。于是，就不需要劳动量与消费量是相等的了。
    资产阶级的作家曾费了不少的气力，把共产主义设想为是一个平均主义的王国，在这个王国里似乎所有的人的胃口和需要都是一样的，而且是建立起了“兵营的秩序的”。这只不过是彻头彻尾地暴露出资产阶级意识形态的愚昧无知及其对共产主义的兽性仇视。
    其实，无论在社会主义条件下，无论在共产主义条件下都没有而且也不会有平均主义的。
    马列主义的社会主义原则，粉碎了小资产阶级的概念，他们认为，似乎在社会主义条件下，一切人都得到一样的报酬，都得到同等的保证。这种概念乃是一副对社会主义的讽刺画。社会主义的平等是阶级压迫已被消灭，劳动人民已摆脱剥削，对生产资料已建立同等关系的含意上的平等。然而，社会主义全然不是意味着同等的报酬，因为所有的人都是按劳取酬的，而熟练劳动与不熟练劳动之间，智力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，依然存在。
    在共产主义条件下，这些差别已经排除，“‘粗’工与‘细’工之区分以及智力劳动与体力劳动的矛盾被排除了，劳动是平等的………”（斯大林：《无政府主义还是社会主义？》解放社版八九页）。然而这全然不是说人们的需要是平等的。其实这种平均主义，就在共产主义条件下，在社会已实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，也是不会有的。人们所领得的食物及其它物品，将不是同样的数量，而是与他们的适当需要，他们的胃口相适合的不同的数量。共产主义社会公民们的需要，是全面发展的人们的需要，这种需要本身就是带着多样性的。斯大林同志在批评小资产阶级的平均主义时说到：
    “马克思主义所了解的平等，并不是个人需要和日常生活方面的平均，而是阶级的消灭。这就是说：第一，在推翻与剥夺资本家以后，一切劳动者都平等的摆脱剥削而得到解放；第二，在生产资料转归全社会公有以后，对于大家都是平等的废除生产资料私有制；第三，大家都有按各人能力劳动的平等义务，一切劳动者都有按各人劳动领取劳动报酬的平等权利（社会主义社会）；第四，大家都有按各人能力劳动的平等义务，一切劳动者都有按照各人需要领取劳动报酬的平等权利（共产主义社会）。同时，马克思主义认为各人的胃口和需要，无论按质量或数量来说，无论在社会主义时期或共产主义时期，都不会是，而且不能是彼此一样，大家平等的”。（列宁主义问题，六二四页）
    这就是社会主义与共产主义的基本特征。
    一九二七年，斯大林在说明共产主义的一般特征时说到：“要是对共产主义社会作个简单的解剖，那么，它将是这样一个社会：（一）那里不会有生产工具和生产资料的私有，而只会有集体的公有；（二）那里不会有阶级和国家权利，而只会有工业和农业的劳动者，这些劳动者联合成为劳动者自由联合会，共同管理经济；（三）那里按计划组织起来的国民经济，无论在工业方面或农业方面，将都是以最高的技术为基础的；（四）那里不会有城市与乡村间、工业与农业间的对立形势；（五）那里生产品的分配将按照旧时的法国共产主义者的原则：‘各尽所能，各取所需’；（六）那里科学与艺术将得到充分顺利的条件，以至于可以达到全盛的繁荣；（七）那里每个人因为不必去为糊口而操心，不必去奉承‘世界上的强者’，所以就会成为真正自由的人”（斯大林选集三卷，东北新华书店版七六页）。（⑵⑶）
    斯大林同志指出国家政权的消失，是共产主义的特征之一，他所说明的是那种已经取得了彻底胜利的，起码是在许多最主要的国家中取得了胜利的共产主义的特征。如果共产主义只存在于一个国家中、如果资本主义包围依然存在，那么，在共产主义条件下，国家依然是要被保留下来的。
    斯大林同志在确定共产主义的特征时，只指出了它最重要的特点，只指出了那些能够预见到和科学地判断到的东西。企图预先确定共产主义社会结构的一切详情（例如，详细地确定共产主义条件下日常生活将是怎样的），只不过是虚无缥缈的幻想而已。
    共产主义社会各种详细情况如何，这个问题要由那些将要生活在发达的共产主义社会中的后代去解决。在我们现时，有一点无可争辩的，就是社会主义社会已在苏联建成。社会主义正向前发展着。而社会主义这样继续的发展也就说明着它必然要转入共产主义。
    斯大林同志从理论上论证了在一个国家，尤其是苏联这样的国家建成完全的共产主义社会的可能，他指出：我国具有为此所必须的一切：如最先进的经济，社会政治制度，和取之不尽的自然财富。社会主义国家已经实际地来着手解决这一任务。苏联社会主义的生产方式，早在第二次世界大战之前，就已达到开始逐渐转入共产主义的发展阶段。希特勒德国进攻苏联，暂时打断了这个过程。目前，当希特勒德国及帝国主义日本被击溃以后，苏联人民正在恢复被敌人破坏了的经济，完成着社会主义社会的建设，同时并逐渐过渡到共产主义。苏联在战争中更加壮大起来，它正集中了自己一切力量加速前进，以完成社会主义建设并逐渐过渡到共产主义。
  二、从社会主义过渡到共产主义
  为什么说从社会主义过渡到共产主义是逐渐的
    马列主义教导我们说，社会主义刚一在自己的经济基础上开始发展，它就必然要向高级阶段，向共产主义成长。
    社会主义与共产主义之间没有什么不可逾越的万里长城。共产主义，正如上面曾经指出的，只是新制度经济发展中一个比较成熟的阶段。
    既然社会主义和共产主义有着共同的经济基础，所以由共产主义的低级阶段过渡到它的高级阶段也是逐渐发生的。这个过渡将随国民经济的发展，劳动生产率的增长，群众共产主义觉悟的提高而实现，随着苏维埃国家强大力量的进一步巩固而实现。
    必须了解到，为什么说从社会主义过渡到共产主义是逐渐的。很明显，从社会主义过渡到共产主义是逐渐的，这绝不是说，前进的速度非常缓慢，相反的，社会主义使得社会的发展速度大大的加快了。列宁就曾指出过，“……资产阶级通常把社会主义想像为一种僵死、凝滞、永远不变的东西的这种观念，是无限虚伪的，其实，只有从社会主义实现时起，在社会生活和个人生活所有各方面，才会开始发生迅速的、真正的、真是群众的、有大多数居民以至全体居民参加的前进运动”（列宁《国家与革命》，解放社版，第一二五页）。苏联的社会主义建设经验完全证实了列宁的这些预言。几个斯大林五年计划的提前完成，更特别光辉地证明着这一点。
    同时也很明显，从社会主义过渡到共产主义是逐渐的，这绝不是说，在社会生活个别方面的发展中，如生产的发展，技术和科学的进步中等等，就没有跃进。就以斯达汉诺夫运动为例，它使我们加速地向共产主义发展，照斯大林同志的话说，“它负有在我国工业里实行一个革命的使命”（斯大林《列宁主义问题》，莫斯科版，第六五四页）。同样毫无疑问，例如将原子能应用于生产这样的巨大发现，能够，并且必将引起一个真正的技术革命。这就是说，在我们的社会从社会主义向共产主义发展的过程中，各种跃进是当然会有的。我们去理解这种发展之逐渐进行，绝不应当像形而上学的进化论者所论断的那样。
    从社会主义过渡到共产主义是逐渐的，这就是说，这种过渡不是一下子就完成的，这不是一时的行动，不是社会革命。这也就是说，从社会主义过渡到共产主义这一过程的性质，与从资本主义过渡到社会主义，是完全不同的。从资本主义向社会主义过渡，不经过社会革命是不能实现的，因为这是从一种社会经济形态过渡到另一种社会经济形态，从一种生产方式过渡到另一种生产方式，这种过渡的前提，就是要以强力消灭衰亡着的生产方式，以强力推翻衰亡着的阶级。相反地，从社会主义向共产主义过渡，这是从同一社会经济形态的一个发展阶段过渡到另一个发展阶段，它的实现是以同一生产方式为基础，没有推翻任何阶级的必要，而它的前提就是逐渐地消灭阶级界限。这种过渡不需要社会革命，也不可能以一时的行动来实现。列宁曾经指出，马克思主义者从来也没有约许过“硬加施行”共产主义，这句话并不是无的放矢的。由于社会达到更高的经济发展程度，共产主义也就从社会主义中成长起来。而经济更高发展的首要前提就是社会主义生产力的更加发展。
  生产力的最高发展是保证过渡到共产主义的条件
    马克思和恩格斯早在《共产党宣言》中就曾写过，无产阶级利用自己的政治统治，以便“集中一切生产工具于国家手中，即集中于已组织成为统治阶级的无产阶级手中，并尽量迅速地增殖生产力总量”（马克思与恩格斯《共产党宣言》，解放社版，第七○页）。
    马克思和恩格斯认为，当生产力的发展达到了这样的阶段，即当社会财富的一切泉源都像洪流一般地涌出时，共产主义就成为可能的了。
    马克思和恩格斯不能更具体地判定建成共产主义所必需的那种生产力发展水平。列宁根据俄国社会主义革命的经验，已经比较具体地判定了这个水平。他指出，必须在经济方面赶上并且超过发达的资本主义国家，必须创造出高度的劳动生产率，使它比在资本主义条件下高得多。
    列宁认为，为要过渡到共产主义所必需的生产力发展的高度水平，是与国民经济一切部门有计划地实行电气化紧密联系着的。由此列宁也就得出了一个天才的公式：“共产主义等于苏维埃政权加全国电气化。”
    斯大林同志把向共产主义过渡的物质前提问题加以发挥，他根据马克思、列宁所没有掌握的材料把这个问题解决的更加具体。在马克思主义的历史中，他第一个具体地判定了在苏联为要建成共产主义所必需的那种生产力发展水平。斯大林同志在一九三九年联共（布）党第十八次代表大会上，说明实现从社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的、创造物质基础的伟大工作计划时，他说：“我们在生产技术和工业发展速度方面已超过了各主要资本主义国家。这当然很好。但是这还不够。必须在经济方面也超过它们。我们能够做到这一步，而且我们应当做到这一步。只有当我们在经济上也超过各主要资本主义国家时，我们才可希望我国有完全充足的消费品，有丰富的食品，那时我们就有可能实行从共产主义第一阶段过渡到共产主义第二阶段”（斯大林《列宁主义问题》，莫斯科版，第七五七页）。
    一九四六年二月，斯大林同志指出，苏联的生产力必须达到这样一种水平，就是每年能生产出生铁达五千万吨，钢达六千万吨，煤炭达五万万吨，石油达六千万吨。苏联国民经济中其它部门也应与此相适应地获得发展。达到了这个水平，那么也就是说创造了共产主义的必要物质基础。要实现斯大林的这个计划，就必须在日益完善的技术基础上投入大批的新资本，建设新的工业企业。
    为要判断苏联与这个计划所规定的水平还有多大的距离，我们可以举出苏联在战后第一个五年计划完成时，也就是到一九五○年年底，将要达到的工业总产量。
    战后第一个五年计划完成时，各重要工业部门的生产水平将达到下列数量：生铁约两千万吨，钢两千五百万吨以上，辗铁约两千八百万吨，煤炭两万万五千万吨，石油三千五百四十万吨，电力八百二十万万基罗瓦特小时。
    苏联劳动生产率增长的速度超过了历史上任何时候。一九四六到一九五○年的五年计划期间，劳动生产率比一九四○年增长了百分之三十六。
    在这一个五年计划期间，全部工业每年所增加的产量超过一百六十万万卢布。这种每年的增长量是多么巨大，只要和以前的情形比较一下就可看出，第三个五年计划（战前）的三个年头中，每年增加的产量为一百四十三万万一千六百万卢布，第二个五年计划中，每年的增加为一百零五万万卢布，而第一个五年计划时，每年的增加只有五十五万万卢布。
    所有这些都说明，当战后五年计划完成时，苏联的工业生产水平与战前一九四○年比较，整个说来，将要增长百分之五十，而在某些工业部门里更要多些。例如，到一九五○年年底，机器和机械装备将要比战前多生产出一倍，金属削切机的数量将要增加到一百三十万台，这就是说比美国在一九四○年所有的车床总量还超过百分之三十左右，电力生产将要增大百分之七十，采煤量增大百分之五十以上。
    苏联工业不仅在技术和发展速度方面，就是按其构成说来，现在也都有着超越于资本主义工业的优势。一九三五年美国机器制造业在工业生产量中的比重为百分之十七点六，英国为百分之十六点二，而苏联早在第二个五年计划末期，机器制造业就已达到了百分之二十五。
    战后五年计划期间，苏联的农业也大大地向前迈进了一步，一九四八年便达到战前谷物的总收获量，而就每公顷的生产率说来，已经超过了战前水平。一九四九年收获粮食七十六万万普特，这比第二次世界大战前最丰收的年度还多。一九五○年收获量又将超过一九四九年。到一九五○年年底农业总产量将比一九四○年增多百分之三十，全年的谷物收获量将要达到一万万三千万吨。
    关于战后第一个五年计划中社会主义农业增长的情形，可由下面的数字得出一个明确的概念。如果以一九三二年总产量的生产水平作为百分之百，那末一九三七年为百分之一五三，一九四○年为百分之一七七，而一九五○年为百分之二二五。
    这就是保证着工农业全面而平衡发展的社会主义之优点。
    苏维埃国家以极大的力量帮助集体农庄，向农业中投入大量的资财，例如供给它以最新式的技术装备，化学肥料，保证给它以有修养的技术和农学干部。战后五年计划的数年中，投入农业的约有三十五万架拖拉机以及许多其他生产率极高的现代农业机器，新建立了约一千处农业机器站（ＭＴＣ）。
    农业及与农业有关的各种生产的电气化，正以空前的规模发展着。单以正在建设的小型农村水电站计算，发电量就有一百万基罗瓦特小时，这不仅保证着农业机器站和国营农场的电气化，而且也保证着将近全部数量三分之一的集体农庄的电气化。现在有许多省已经全面电气化了。最近数年内农业电气化将要全部完成。
    在进一步发展社会主义经济的生产力和创造为实现共产主义所必需的丰富产品的事业中，为争取可靠的丰收而斗争的斯大林计划，植林护田计划，在草原地带建设蓄水池等一系列的农业科学措施，有着极其巨大的意义。实行一九四九年苏联政府所制定的发展畜牧业的三年计划，也是为创造丰富的食物这一目的而服务的。
    决定建设的古比雪夫，斯大林格勒，加霍夫水电站和土库曼大运河，南乌克兰，北克里米亚各条运河的建设，有着非常巨大的意义。这些水电站及运河在创造共产主义物质基础的事业中，将是有决定性意义的工程。
    新的水电站和运河，每年将要发出二百万万基罗瓦小时以上的电力，将要灌溉约两千五百万公顷草原、沙漠及干燥无水地带的土地。这几个世界上最伟大的工程在五——六年中建成，将使苏维埃社会的生产力大大提高，从而使我们的社会大大地接近于共产主义。
    苏维埃国家对于科学的发达给予特别的注意。苏联学者们面临着这样一个任务——在最近时期中超过国外的科学成就。这个任务，对于我们的学者，是完全可以胜任的，因为他们有苏维埃社会主义国家的支持，他们有千百万苏维埃知识分子和全体劳动者这一支大军作为后盾，而且他们还握有头等的研究院和实验室。科学的发达，必然要使社会主义技术获得新的成就。
    国民经济的大规模发展，只有在高度熟练的工程师、技师和工人的大军不断长大时，才可能实现。下面的统计数字，说明着培养新干部这一工作的规模。一九五○年在高等及中等技术学校中学习的达二百万人以上，五年计划期间已经在这些学校里毕业了的约二百万人。同一时期里，国家后备劳动力训练部系统中培养了四百五十万青年熟练工人。此外，直接在生产中训练了约一千九百万工人。一九五○年在小学及中学中有学生三千五百万人以上。
    这些统计数字，可以使我们对于苏维埃国家在提高苏联人民文化技术水平方面的工作所具有的规模，得到一个概括的了解。
    国民经济的发展，是在日益扩大的社会主义再生产的基础上进行的，它的发展规模和速度是在经常不断地增大。每一个新的五年计划，都是在更加扩大的基础上，以更大的规模和速度，扩大着社会主义社会的物质技术基础。
    究竟需要多少时候，苏联便可达到斯大林同志作为是在苏联实现从社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的条件而提到的那种生产力发展水平呢？
    从发展的内部条件上来看，如果这个发展不被外部条件所暂时打断的话，这大约还需要三个新的五年计划。
    在大约三个新的五年计划过程中，苏联的基本经济任务——在经济方面赶上并超过先进的资本主义国家——将要获得解决，就是说，按每个人所得的生产量，我国将完全接近于美国平均每人所得的工业生产量，而按工业生产总量则将大大地超过美国。这时，苏联就将成为世界最巨大的工业国，成为世界上最富强的国家。
    因此，向共产主义过渡，建成共产主义，这对于苏维埃社会来说，已不是遥远的幻想，而是苏维埃人们日常工作中的实践问题，每一个苏联公民的斗争与创造的问题。
    从按劳分配到各取所需
    实现向共产主义过渡的基本条件，是生产力进一步的日益加速发展，首先是制造生产工具和资料的工业的增长。在这个基础上，将创造出丰富的消费品，其结果，就有可能实际地充分满足全体公民的需要。
    过渡到各取所需，这是不会在各消费部门中同时实现的，而是逐渐地，随着某些部门中生产发展的程度而定。首先具有丰富数量的，将是全体人民生活所最必需的那些消费品。
    在完成苏联基本经济任务的过程中，一方面，人们的文化技术将要提高，因之他们的工资也将提高，另一方面，将要创造出丰富的产品，而物价便将逐渐减低。这样，苏联人民便逐渐地走向共产主义。社会将握有日益增多的资料，用以最充分地去满足共产主义社会全体公民增长着的需要。
    在苏联建成社会主义的经验，对于在理论上解决共产主义开始阶段上如何实现共产主义原则的问题，提供了最丰富的材料。这个经验使我们有可能把某些关于实现共产主义原则的已有的马克思主义原理更加确切起来。
    正如斯大林同志所表明的，在社会主义条件下，商业和货币仍然是必要的。马克思和恩格斯曾经推断说，社会主义将以简单的领收证来代替货币，这种领收证载明工作者作了多少小时的工，他可以凭证领取相当数量的生产物。马克思和恩格斯的这个推断没有实现。斯大林同志指明，在共产主义的第一个阶段，价值法则在改造了的形态下起着作用，货币和商业还继续存在，它们是苏维埃国家手中发展经济的重要杠杆。
    价值法则在苏联之形成并且发生作用，是以苏维埃国家对于国家整个经济发展的有计划的领导为基础的。它不再表现着剥削的关系，私人的、独立生产者的关系。它已不是一种自发地起着作用的力量，而是被社会主义国家自觉地加以应用和利用了。
    在社会主义社会中，存在着货币和商业。但是无论货币或是商业，在苏联所表现的社会关系，是与资本主义社会所表现的，有着原则上的区别，它们是苏维埃国家在组织交换、分配、经济核算和结算上的工具，是发展社会主义经济的工具。
    毫无疑问，用各种方法发展和改进着的苏维埃社会主义商业，乃是向共产主义过渡时和进入共产主义时，供应居民的主要方式，方法。
    因此，必须抛弃这样一个概念：以为一向共产主义过渡，商业和货币似乎也就要马上消灭。其实不然，苏维埃商业和货币就是在共产主义的初期也是要保存的。实际上是可以想像得到的，商品将是如此的丰富，而它们的价格又将是如此的低廉，以致每个人都有完全的可能去日益充分而多方面地满足自己的需要。举例说，假如面包、杂粮、油、肉都极其丰富而且价格又极低廉，那末，每一个劳动者，每一个家庭都将能够每天充分满足自己对于这些消费品的需要，也就是说都能够各取所需。其它的日用品如衣服、鞋子等也都将有类似的情况。
    因此，过渡到各取所需，这完全是一个现实的过程，与任何幻想及小资产阶级的世外桃源无任何关系的，他们认为，好像在共产主义社会中，一切都将堆积在仓库里，每个人都可以走进去随便取用，而没有任何的社会计算和监督。
    科学的、马克思主义的共产主义，与这种小资产阶级的、无政府主义的关于共产主义的概念，绝无任何共同之点。
    关于在共产主义条件下实行物物交换的马克思主义公式，表现着一个总原则，就是在共产主义条件下，每个公民，因为他对社会付出了劳动，他便有可能满足自己的一切需要。
    向共产主义过渡将要在社会主义经济原则全面发展与巩固的基础上实现。
  群众共产主义觉悟的提高是向共产主义过渡的一个条件
    列宁在《国家与革命》一书中指出，向共产主义的高级阶段过渡，即当社会开始实现“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则时，这不仅要求有更高的生产力发展水平，而且人们本身，他们的意识，他们的劳动态度和他们的需要，也都必须改变。这时将是一个共产主义意识占统治地位的社会，共产主义意识，首先表现在共产主义的劳动态度中。共产主义社会，这是劳动生产率最高的社会。这种最高的劳动生产率，是由于技术及生产者本身的全面发展，由于他们具有自觉的、共产主义的劳动态度而达到的。
    现在在苏联，劳动已经成了光荣、豪迈和英勇的事业。一个苏联人设想不到怎么可以生活而不劳动。在我国，这种不劳而食的荒谬行为，已经彻底根除，逃避工作被看作是资本主义的残余，是可耻的行为。把劳动看作是自己个人和社会的职责，这种新的劳动态度正在日益发扬光大。为社会而劳动，日益变成为一个人的自然需要和习惯。
    社会主义的劳动，乃是光荣的事业，荣耀的事业，豪迈和英勇的事业，其中已经包含着共产主义劳动的基础。然而社会主义劳动还是有定额的劳动，它是被根据劳动的数量和质量而付给的报酬所刺激着的。
    在社会主义社会发展过程中，苏联人们逐渐养成共产主义的劳动态度，把劳动看成最迫切的生活的需要。养成这种劳动态度的方法，就是培养自觉的劳动态度，把劳动当作是对社会的首要的职责。党和政府对于先进生产者予以精神上的支持和物质上的奖励，从而把全体群众提高到他们的水平。
    苏联劳动者的社会主义竞赛，是我们发展中经常的强大动力，是建设共产主义的基本方法。社会主义群众竞赛，不仅是前所未见的，资产阶级制度所不可获得的生产发展的强大泉源，这个竞赛同时还是以共产主义精神教育劳动者的重要方法之一。
    共产主义劳动就是这样逐渐从人们对自己应尽义务所持的社会主义态度中成熟起来。  （未完）
