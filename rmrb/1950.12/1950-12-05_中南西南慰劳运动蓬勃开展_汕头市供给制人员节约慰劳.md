[本报讯] The comfort campaign for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in the Central South and Southwest regions is flourishing.

The people of all circles in Henan Province are donating comfort items one after another. At a study and discussion meeting on November 24, the Supply Section of the Henan Postal Administration, led by Wang Qishan and Gao Guanwu, launched a grenade donation campaign. Thirty-one employees immediately signed up to donate 58 and a half grenades, totaling 1.17 million yuan in Renminbi. Teachers and students of the First Primary School in Zhumadian City, Henan Province, initiated a bullet donation campaign. As of November 30, they had donated 117 bullets in two days, totaling 58,500 yuan in Renminbi. At the beginning of the donation, Xing Decheng, a second-grade elementary school student, first sent his two-month savings of 4,000 yuan to his grade teacher, clenched his small fist and said, "In order to defeat the American bandits, I will not spend any of these pocket money. I will donate all of it to buy 'foreign snacks' (referring to bullets) for the American devils!"

Many supply-system staff members in various organs in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, are practicing strict frugality to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Youths from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City are not only donating various items, but also writing more than a thousand letters of comfort.

Among the many comfort items received by the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, the teachers and students of Chongqing Women's Middle School donated seven silk banners and a commemorative album with photos and best wishes from sixty-three students, dedicated to General Kim Il-sung. Yao Jin, a female student from the school, sent a photo of the Soviet Youth Guard's surprise attack on a German concentration camp during World War II. She wrote on it: "Although I am not in this photo, I am in the battle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country."

    中南西南慰劳运动蓬勃开展  汕头市供给制人员节约慰劳
    【本报讯】中南区和西南区慰劳中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的运动，正在蓬勃开展着。
    河南省各界人民都在纷纷捐献慰劳品。河南邮政管理局供应科在十一月二十四日的学习讨论会上，以王岐山、高冠五带头，发起捐献手榴弹运动，当场即有三十一名职工报名捐出五十八颗半手榴弹，计人民币一百一十七万元。该省驻马店市立第一小学师生，发起捐献一颗子弹运动。截至上月三十日，两天内，共捐子弹一百一十七颗，计人民币五万八千五百元。捐献开始时，二年级小学生邢德成，首先把自己积蓄了两个月的零花钱四千元，送到他的级任老师那里去，紧握着小拳头说：“为了打败美国强盗，这些零花钱，我一个也不花了，都捐出来给美国鬼子买‘洋点心’（指子弹）吃吧！”
    广东省汕头市各机关许多供给制的工作人员，都厉行节约慰劳中国人民志愿部队。湛江市各界青年，除正在进行捐献各种物品外，同时写了千多封慰问信。
    重庆新华日报收转的许多慰问品中，有重庆市女中师生献赠的锦旗七面，并有一本贴有六十三个学生照片和祝词的纪念册，献给金日成将军。该校女学生姚进送了一张第二次世界大战中苏联青年近卫军偷袭德寇集中营的照片。她在上面写道：“这张照片上虽然没有我，但在抗美援朝保家卫国的战斗中是有我的。”
