    [This News Agency Report] According to the Northeast Daily, tax bureaus in Northeast China have initially implemented the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Northeast Tax Administration Bureau during the winter tax collection. They have grasped the key tax sources and strengthened management and anti-smuggling efforts, ensuring the smooth completion of the planned tax revenue targets for October and November.
    Since the beginning of the winter tax collection, various regions have formulated new collection plans based on their tasks and the actual situation of tax sources, ensuring that the collection plans guarantee the completion of the tasks. For example, Jilin Province re-examined the fourth quarter and next year's tax revenue budget and made appropriate adjustments. In Shenyang City, the business tax revenue for October and November also benefited from the review of key plans, which clarified the focus and increased the confidence of cadres, overcoming the phenomena of uneven burden and completing the income plan.
    In general, the focus has been further placed on grasping key tax sources during collection. First, personnel allocation was adjusted based on key tax sources, overcoming the past practice of using general force. For example, in the Shenyang City Tax Bureau, field tax collection personnel accounted for only 20% of the total number of employees in the past. Since the winter tax collection, this has increased to 50%. In areas such as Anshan City, branch offices have been added in key tax source areas, which has played a significant role in completing the plan. Second, the management of key areas, key industries, and key households has been strengthened, resulting in a significant increase in income. For example, after the Yanji branch strengthened the management and inspection of key households, it discovered many instances of tax evasion, including one grain store alone evading more than 300 million yuan (Northeast currency) in special product tax.
    Various regions have strengthened inspection and anti-smuggling work, and experience has proven that this is an important guarantee for the completion of the winter tax collection plan. It not only reduces the loss of national tax revenue but also educates law-breaking merchants to pay taxes at the prescribed rates.
    Local Party, government, and tax authorities have combined current affairs propaganda to enhance merchants' understanding of protecting the country and defending the home, promoting the spirit of patriotism, which has also played a positive role in ensuring the timely entry of tax payments (especially income tax) into the treasury. For example, in Shangzhi County, some merchants rushed to pay their taxes on the same day they received the tax payment notice. In Anshan City, some merchants even advanced funds for their peers to ensure timely payment. Tax cadres in various regions worked day and night. The provincial bureau chiefs of Songjiang and Rehe provinces personally went deep into key cities and counties to inspect the collection situation and specifically help improve the work. In particular, all the staff of the Andong City Bureau persisted in their work despite the continuous intrusions of American aircraft. Coupled with the active payment by the city's business community, the third quarter income tax was completed and deposited into the treasury in just nine days.

    东北十、十一两月份税收
    完成预定计划按时入库
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北各地税局在冬征中，初步贯彻了财政部与东北区税务管理局的指示，掌握税源重点，加强管理缉私，使十、十一两月税收预定计划顺利完成。
    冬征开始以来，各地根据任务及税源实际情况，制订了新的征收计划，使征收计划保证了任务的完成。如吉林省重新审查了第四季度及明年税收预算后，进行了适当调整。沈阳市十、十一月份营业税也由于审订了计划重点明确，干部信心因而提高，克服了畸轻畸重现象，完成了收入计划。
    征收中一般都进一步贯彻了重点掌握税源。首先依据重点税源调整了人员配备，克服了过去一般使用力量的现象。如沈阳市税局过去外勤稽征人员仅占全局人数的百分之二十，冬征以来，即增加到百分之五十。鞍山市等地于重点税源地区增设了分所，对完成计划起了很大作用。其次加强了重点区重点行业与重点户的管理，使收入显著增加。如延吉支局加强重点户管理检查后，即发现很多偷漏现象，其中仅一家粮栈漏特产税款就达三亿余元（东北币）。
    各地加强检查缉私工作，经验并证明对冬征计划的完成是重要的保证之一，不仅减少了国家税收的损失，并教育了不守法的商人依率缴纳。
    各地党政及税收机关结合时事宣传，提高商人对保家卫国的认识，发扬爱国主义精神，对保证税款（特别是所得税）及时入库上也起了积极推动作用。如尚志县有些商人收到纳税通知的当天即抢先交了款；鞍山市有些商人并为同业垫款，以便保证按时缴纳。各地税工干部则日以继夜紧张工作。松江、热河两省省局长并亲自深入重点市县检查征收情形，具体帮助改进工作。特别是安东市局全体工作人员，虽在美机不断侵袭中，仍坚持工作，加之该市工商界积极缴纳，使第三季度所得税仅九天即完成入库。
