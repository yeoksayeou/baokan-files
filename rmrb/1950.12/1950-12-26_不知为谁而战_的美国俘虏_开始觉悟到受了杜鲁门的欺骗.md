Xinhua News Agency Report: "Not knowing for whom they fight," the officers and soldiers of the American invading army were frozen and starving, and filled with terror before being captured. This reporter saw the first batch of 173 American prisoners of war escorted from the northeastern front lines of Korea to the rear. They belonged to the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division of the American invading army. These two divisions of the American invading army were divided and encircled by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Changjin Lake area, their land supply lines were completely cut off, and they suffered heavy casualties. Some of these 173 prisoners still bore expressions of terror and panic from the battlefield. Their hair was disheveled like a handful of weeds, their faces were covered with dust and thick beards, and their clothing was thin. More than 50 of them had frostbite on their hands and feet. A soldier from the U.S. 7th Division named Kenney, whose feet were so swollen from frostbite that he could not put on his shoes, walked with his feet wrapped in a military blanket. Many cried because their hands were so frostbitten that they could not hold food, and some cried because their feet were so frostbitten that they could not walk. When their own planes came to strafe, they cried even more. Before being captured, they had not eaten for several days, and some even hid stolen or looted raw corn on their bodies. Once they were given rice after being captured, the 173 men ate 250 *jin* (125 kg).

After being escorted to the rear, these prisoners immediately received proper care. They were warmly clothed and well-fed, and their wounds were treated. Now, in every place where prisoners are being managed and educated, the terrified and starving appearance they had when captured is no longer visible. They are happily talking about the luck of being captured, some are cheerfully playing the harmonica, and some are humming songs. Second Lieutenant Delashmet of the U.S. 25th Division said, "We did not expect this kind of lenient treatment of prisoners." What they appreciate most is the respect for their personalities and the fact that their wallets were not searched by the Chinese People's Volunteers. When they were first captured, they were afraid that their personal belongings would be taken away. But no one had anything personal taken from them. Sergeant Martin once tried to give a wallet containing more than 20 U.S. dollars to a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, but the soldier sternly refused, and told Martin: "The Chinese don't want U.S. dollars, we want freedom and peace."

After personally receiving lenient treatment and undergoing short-term education, some of the American prisoners have initially recognized their aggressive crimes and begun to realize that they were deceived by Truman and MacArthur into invading other countries. Twenty-year-old infantryman Philip was crying when he was first captured, but now he says: "I was indeed deceived by Truman. My home is in the United States, why did I come to Korea to fight?" He resents that he "although received secondary education, but the mind is still so simple." Corporal Ansemy also said: "It is very absurd for us to come here to fight, the United States has not been invaded by Korea at all!" Rifleman Lord excitedly cursed: "No matter what United Nations or not, we should not have come to Korea!" The prisoners almost unanimously expressed: Go home! Many resentfully said: Why are we fighting this war?

### “不知为谁而战”的美国俘虏  开始觉悟到受了杜鲁门的欺骗

    “不知为谁而战”的美国俘虏
    开始觉悟到受了杜鲁门的欺骗
    【本报讯】据新华社记者报道：“不知为谁而战”的美国侵略军的官兵在被俘前，都是冻馁不堪，而且是惊恐万状。记者看到一百七十三个由朝鲜东北前线押解到后方的第一批美国俘虏。他们是属于美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师和步兵第七师的。美国侵略军的这两个师在长津湖地区遭到我国人民志愿军的分割围歼，陆上接济全被阻断，死伤惨重。这一百七十三个俘虏有些人还带着从战场上所感受的恐怖惊慌的表情。他们的头发蓬松得像一把乱草，满面是尘垢和浓密的胡髭，衣着单薄，其中有五十多人的手足都冻伤了。美军第七师一个名叫坎莱（Kenney）的士兵，因为脚冻肿了，穿不上鞋子，而用军毯包着脚走路。有很多人因为手冻伤了不能拿东西吃而大哭起来，有的因脚冻伤走不动路而哭起来，遇到他们自己的飞机前来扫射时，更是大哭不已。他们在被俘前，已经好几天没有吃东西，有的人身上还藏着偷来或抢来的生玉蜀黍。他们被俘后有一次吃大米饭，一百七十三人竟吃了二百五十斤。
    在押解到后方后，这些俘虏们立刻得到了妥善的照顾，衣暖食足，创伤也得到了治疗。现在在每一处管训俘虏的地方，已经看不到他们被俘时的那种惊恐而冻馁的狼狈相了。他们在嬉笑地谈着被俘的幸运，有的在愉快地吹口琴，有的在哼着歌曲。美军第二十五师的少尉地拉斯麦特（Delashmet）说：“你们对俘虏的这种宽待，是我们没有想到的。”最使他们感激的是中国人民志愿军对他们人格的尊重和不搜腰包。他们在刚被俘时，害怕自己身上带的私人物件会被搜去。但没有任何一个人被拿去任何属于私人的东西。军曹马丁（Martin）曾经拿着装有二十多元美金的票夹要送给中国人民志愿军的战士，被这位战士严厉拒绝，他并且告诉马丁说：“中国人不要美金，我们要的是自由、和平。”
    美国俘虏们在亲身受到宽大待遇并经过短期教育后，有些人已初步地认识自己的侵略罪行，开始领悟到他们是受了杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟的欺骗来侵略别人的国家的。二十岁的步兵菲利浦（Philip）在开始被俘时是哭丧着脸的，现在他说：“我确是受了杜鲁门的欺骗。我的家在美国，为什么要跑到朝鲜来作战呢？”他恼恨自己“虽然受过中等教育，但头脑还是如此简单”。下士安塞密也说：“我们来这里作战是非常荒谬的，美国根本没有受到朝鲜的侵略！”步枪手劳德则激动地骂道：“不管什么联合国不联合国，反正我们是不应该到朝鲜来！”俘虏们几乎是一致地表示：回家去！很多人怨恨地表示：我们为什么要打这个仗呢？
