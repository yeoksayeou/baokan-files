    Tsinghua and Yanjing University Students Further Consolidate Anti-American Enthusiasm After Going to Factories and the Countryside for Propaganda
    Summarize Experiences, Prepare to Further Expand the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    [Our Newspaper] To summarize experiences and further consolidate and expand the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation Movement, students from Tsinghua University and faculty and students from Yanjing University held summary evening gatherings and celebration rallies on the evening of November 27th, respectively.
    Students from both universities displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their propaganda work in factories and the countryside. They not only awakened workers' and peasants' hatred for American imperialism, but also, by witnessing the workers' and peasants' love for the motherland, love for their leaders, and hatred for American imperialism, and by listening to their accusations against imperialism, they universally increased their hatred, contempt, and scorn for American imperialism. The propaganda team composed of five departments including Mechanics and Civil Engineering of Yanjing University brought one hundred portraits of Chairman Mao to the countryside and gave them to the villagers, which was warmly welcomed. One villager took the portrait and showed it to everyone, and finally hid it in his chest. This deeply moved the students. During the free speech session at the meeting, Yanjing University students Zhang Ruisheng, Ge Fulong, Liang Guanpei, and others reported on their transformation from admiring the United States to hating American imperialism. Ge Fulong said, "In the past, I only hated that I was not born in the United States and was not an American. But today I don't think so anymore. I feel so glorious and happy to be Chinese!" Liang Guanpei used to admire the American way of life, but when he personally heard workers bitterly accusing imperialism of its brutal crimes, he realized that "only by overthrowing imperialism can we enjoy a peaceful and happy life," so he actively participated in the team's work of drawing cartoons. Although his bronchitis flared up again, he still insisted on working. When the departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the university went to the countryside for propaganda, many model figures in various aspects of active work emerged.
    During this period, Yanjing University's trade union members mainly focused on learning and cooperated with other actions, holding three discussion meetings, which yielded considerable results. In the movement, they also demonstrated a spirit of mutual assistance and love. Once, the trade union held an evening party to Resist America and Aid Korea. In order to enable workers and police to attend and participate, more than 40 professors and staff members replaced them, temporarily serving as gatekeepers for various buildings and courtyards and as campus police on duty.
    Regarding future work, the student unions of Tsinghua and Yanjing University unanimously pointed out during their summary that it is necessary to closely follow and study current affairs, master science and technology, and be ready to respond to the motherland's call and serve the motherland at any time.

    清华燕大学生下厂下乡宣传后
    抗美热情更加巩固
    总结经验，准备进一步扩大抗美援朝运动。
    【本报讯】为了总结经验，进一步巩固与扩大抗美援朝保家卫国运动，清华大学学生和燕京大学师生分别在十一月二十七日晚召开了总结晚会和庆功大会。
    该两校学生在下厂、下乡宣传中，都表现了高度的积极性与创造性。他们不但启发了工人、农民对美帝的仇恨，同时因为看到工人、农民热爱祖国、热爱自己的领袖、痛恨美帝的情形，和听了他们对帝国主义的控诉，普遍提高了对美帝的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。燕大机械、土木等五系组成的宣传队，下乡宣传时，带了一百张毛主席的画像送给老乡们，受到了热烈欢迎。一个老乡拿着画像到处给人看，最后把他再藏在胸口。这使学生们非常感动。在大会自由发言中，燕大学生张锐生、戈福龙、梁关培等报告了他们从崇美到痛恨美帝的转变经过。戈福隆说：“我过去只恨自己不生在美国，不是美国人。但是今天我却不那么想了。我感到作中国人是多么的光荣与幸福啊！”梁关培以前是很羡慕美国生活方式的，但当他亲自听到工人悲愤地控诉帝国主义残暴罪行时，使他认识到“只有打倒帝国主义，才能享受太平幸福的日子”，于是积极地参加了大队的绘制漫画的工作。虽然他的气管炎又发作了，但仍然坚持工作。该校化学、化工等系下乡宣传时，涌现了不少积极工作的各方面的模范人物。
    燕大工会会员这一阶段是以学习为主，配合他其行动，举行了三次座谈会，有了不小收获。在运动中，并发挥了互助友爱的精神。有一次工会举办抗美援朝晚会，为了使工、警们都能出席参加，有四十多个教授、职员代替他们，暂充各楼院门房和当校警站岗。
    关于今后的工作，清华、燕大两校学生会总结时，一致指出：要密切关心并学好时事，掌握科学技术，随时准备响应祖国号召，为祖国服务。
