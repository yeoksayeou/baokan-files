The people of our country and peace-loving people around the world all yearn for a peaceful resolution to the Korean War. It is precisely for this reason that we express our firm opposition to the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Man Committee," which is sufficient to fuel American aggression. The statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of our country regarding the UN's illegal resolution fully conforms to the wishes of our people. All those who sincerely hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and an end to the Korean War should pay attention to this statement and should strive in the direction pointed out by this statement.

The illegal resolution of the UN General Assembly's "Korean Armistice Three-Man Committee" must be discarded. Because this resolution only suits the military requirements of the American aggressors. The fact that the US government has no sincerity in ending the war of aggression against Korea is a fact known to the world. US representative Austin admitted during the discussion of this proposal in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly that the US's purpose was merely a hypocritical "armistice" in order to "protect" its "armed forces" (see USIS Success Lake telegram of the 12th of this month); US Secretary of State Acheson further stated that "the United States agrees to an armistice in Korea, but this does not mean accepting political conditions from Beijing" (see United Press International Washington dispatch of the 13th); the representative of MacArthur's headquarters even arrogantly declared that "an armistice can only be accepted on a military basis without any political conditions" (see Associated Press New York dispatch of the 17th). Therefore, "most American observers expect little progress in the negotiations, because the United States is determined to discuss an armistice only on a military basis" (see Associated Press Success Lake dispatch of the 18th). This completely exposes the whole trick of "armistice first, negotiations later" supported by the US government.

Today, when the American aggressor army has suffered a decisive defeat, what it urgently desires is nothing more than such an "armistice." Such an "armistice" is a magic weapon for war criminals to escape death. It is they who are speculating by using the people's desire for peace, and it is a complete robber's speculative business. This is a profitable business for the ringleaders of the robbers, because through this business, they can gain time to catch their breath, maintain their existing aggressive positions; and use this to declare a "national emergency," and can arbitrarily exploit the working people of their own country, earn high profits from arms production, and extort cannon fodder from other capitalist countries to step up the mobilization for a new war. However, no one should be willing to partner with the robbers in this kind of speculative business anymore. Former US Ambassador to the UK Kennedy said correctly on December 12, "Our (American) policy today is politically and morally bankrupt." Then, shouldn't the governments and their representatives of some countries that are following the US policy today wake up? Can they still willingly continue to act as servants of the United States?

All the tricks of murder and robbery by American bandits are completely ineffective for the Chinese people. As Foreign Minister Zhou said in his statement, "The three-man group—on-the-spot ceasefire—peaceful negotiation—all-out offensive. This Marshall formula is very familiar to the Chinese people, because General Marshall helped Chiang Kai-shek to carry it out repeatedly for a whole year in 1946, and finally declared failure and left." In those years, Marshall in China, while playing with the three-man group's "ceasefire" and "negotiations," transported troops for Chiang Kai-shek and launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas with fully American-equipped aircraft. This old trick is now being used to confuse the eyes of the Chinese people. How can this be allowed?

The governments and their representatives of any country that wishes for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should recognize that the so-called "armistice" of the UN's illegal resolution and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue advocated by the people of China, the Soviet Union, and the world are two completely different propositions. There is a fundamental difference in principle between the two. The boundary between these two principles must be drawn clearly, and no attempt should be made to blur and confuse it. Any attempt to be ambiguous between these two principles will be futile. The proposition of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is: all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, and let the Korean people solve the Korean issue themselves. This proposition is so clear that it has nothing in common with the so-called "armistice" of the UN's illegal resolution supported by the American aggressors. The so-called "armistice" of the UN's illegal resolution can only be interpreted as a ceasefire in situ under the current situation. This not only makes the "armistice" a deceitful term and a cover for the American aggressor army to launch a new offensive, and cannot achieve the goal of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at all; but also such an "armistice," since it allows the American aggressor army not to withdraw from Korea immediately, is tantamount to requiring the eternal maintenance of the unprecedented bloody rule of the American and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs in massacring the Korean people, and this bloody rule should not be maintained for a moment. A United Press International dispatch from Seoul on the 16th revealed that the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, under the instruction and cover of the American aggressors and the so-called "United Nations Korean Commission," is continuing to carry out barbaric bloody massacres of the Korean people. On December 11 alone, 578 people, including some women and children, were collectively massacred in the northern suburbs of Seoul. In the early morning of December 16, near the station of the Northumberland Infantry Regiment of the British Army, thirty-four "prisoners" who "did not announce any specific charges" were collectively massacred. This large-scale massacre even aroused strong protests from most officers and soldiers of the British army. Therefore, the British Minister to Seoul, Adams, on the 18th, requested the US Embassy, the mastermind of the atrocities, to find a way to ensure that the massacre "does not take place in places visible to British soldiers." From this, it can be seen that the purpose of the American aggressors in Korea is nothing else but to establish, maintain, and expand this bloody rule of constantly massacring the Korean people. The Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world firmly oppose this massacre, and we must not allow the American aggressors to maintain this murderous rule in Korea for a moment. Isn't this the common position that all people with conscience and a sense of justice should have? Therefore, we must insist that the American aggressor army and all foreign troops immediately and completely withdraw from Korea. As long as the aggressor's army withdraws, the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully immediately. Isn't this the most obvious truth?

Our government demands that the American aggressor army withdraw from Taiwan. May I ask what reason does the US government have to refuse to do so? Our government demands to obtain a legitimate status in the United Nations. May I ask what reason does the US government have to oppose it? The US government claims that it has friendship with the Chinese people and upholds justice in the world. Can such bizarre "friendship" and "justice" be conceived in the world? Either withdraw from Taiwan - this is to show that the United States has stopped invading China; or refuse to withdraw from Taiwan - this is to show that the United States is invading China and is determined to continue to invade China. Either recognize China's position in the United Nations - this is to show that the United States is willing to talk the most basic sense to 475 million people and is willing to solve problems with China within the scope of the United Nations; or not recognize China's position in the United Nations - this is to show that the United States is determined to act tyrannically against 475 million people and is unwilling to solve problems with China within the scope of the United Nations. Aren't all of these extremely simple and obvious?

Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a solemn statement on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, saying: "The Chinese people are eager for the Korean war to be resolved peacefully. We insist on taking the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the solution of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves as the basis for negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The American aggressor army must withdraw from Taiwan, and the representatives of the People's Republic of China must obtain a legitimate position in the United Nations; these points are not only the reasonable demands of the Chinese and Korean people, but also the urgent wishes of all progressive public opinion in the world. The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and important Asian issues is impossible without these points." This is the only path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and there is no other path to take.

### 和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路

    和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路
    我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都渴望着朝鲜战争能够得到和平的解决；正因为这样，我们对于联合国大会非法通过的足以助长美国侵略的所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，表示坚决反对。我国中央人民政府周恩来外长就联大非法决议所发表的声明，完全符合于我国人民的愿望。凡是真诚希望和平解决朝鲜问题，结束朝鲜战争的人们，都应当重视这个声明，并且应当按照这个声明所指出的方向而努力。
    联大“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的非法决议是必须加以抛弃的。因为这个决议仅仅适合于美国侵略者的军事要求。美国政府毫无结束侵朝战争的诚意，已是举世周知的事实。美国代表奥斯汀在联大政治委员会讨论这个提案的时候，就已经供认美国的目的只是虚伪的“停战”，以便“保护”它的“武装部队”（见本月十二日美国新闻处成功湖电）；美国国务卿艾奇逊又说明“美国同意在朝鲜停战，但要在这并不意味着接受北京的政治条件的基础上”（见合众社华盛顿十三日电）；麦克阿瑟司令部的代表更狂妄地声称，“唯有在军事基础上而无任何政治条件时，才可接受停战”（见美联社纽约十七日电）。因此，“多数美国的观察家预料谈判将很少进展，因为美国决心唯有在军事基础上才愿讨论停战”（见美联社成功湖十八日电）。这就把美国政府所支持的先停战后谈判的全部西洋镜彻底揭穿了。
    在美国侵略军已经遭受决定性失败的今天，它所迫切盼望的无过于这样的“停战”。这样的“停战”乃是战犯们逃避死亡的法宝，这是它们利用人民要求和平的愿望来进行投机，这是十足的强盗的投机买卖。这对于强盗头子又是一本万利的，因为它们通过这个买卖，可以赚得喘息的时间，保持现有的侵略阵地；并且借此宣布“全国紧急状态”，又可以任意剥削它本国的劳动人民，赚取高额的军火生产的利润，并向其他资本主义国家勒索炮灰，加紧新战争的动员。但是，强盗们的这种投机买卖，是再也不应该有人愿意跟它合伙的了。前美国驻英大使肯尼第在十二月十二日说得对，“我国（美国）今日的政策在政治上与道义上已经破产。”那末，今天追随着美国政策之后的若干国家的政府及其代表们还不应该猛省吗？还能够甘心继续充当美国的仆从吗？
    美国强盗杀人越货的一切花招，对于中国人民是完全无效的。正如周外长在声明中所说，“三人小组——就地停战——和平谈判——大举进攻。这一马歇尔公式对中国人民极不生疏，因为在一九四六年马歇尔将军曾经帮助蒋介石如此反复地进行了一年之久，最后始宣布失败而去。”当年的马歇尔在中国，一面玩弄三人小组的“停战”“谈判”；一面替蒋介石运兵，并以全副美机装备向我解放区大举进攻。这个老戏法现在又要用来迷惑中国人民的眼睛，这怎么能够要得开呢？
    愿望和平解决朝鲜问题的任何国家的政府及其代表们应该认清：联大非法决议的所谓“停战”和中国、苏联及全世界人民所主张的和平解决朝鲜问题，是两个完全不同的主张。在这两者之间，存在着根本原则的区别。必须划清这两个原则的界线，而不要企图去模糊与混淆它。任何企图在这两个原则之间含糊了事的，都将徒劳无功。和平解决朝鲜问题的主张是：一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。这个主张是如此明确，以致与美国侵略者所支持的联大非法决议的所谓“停战”毫无共同之点。联大非法决议的所谓“停战”只能被解释为在目前状况下的就地休战。这不但使“停战”成为骗词，成为美国侵略军重新发动进攻的掩护，根本不能达到和平解决朝鲜问题的目的；而且这样的“停战”，既然允许美国侵略军不从朝鲜立即撤退，这就等于要求永远保持美国和李承晚匪帮史无前例地屠杀朝鲜人民的血腥统治，而这种血腥统治是一刻也不应该保持的。合众社汉城十六日的电讯透露，李承晚匪帮在美国侵略者及所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的指使与掩护下，正继续对朝鲜人民进行野蛮的血腥屠杀。在十二月十一日一天中，在汉城北郊就有五百七十八名包括若干妇女与儿童被集体屠杀。十二月十六日清晨，在英军诺森伯兰步兵团驻地的近旁，有三十四个“没有宣布任何具体罪状”的“犯人”被集体屠杀。这种大规模屠杀的暴行甚至于引起了英军多数官兵的强烈抗议。因此，英国驻汉城公使阿丹姆斯，十八日要求暴行的主使者美国大使馆，设法使这种屠杀“不要在英国军队士兵看得见的地方”。由此可见，美国侵略者在朝鲜的目的不是别的，就是要建立、维持和扩大这种不断地屠杀朝鲜人民的血腥统治。朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界人民坚决反对这种屠杀，我们一刻也不能允许美国侵略者在朝鲜把这种杀人的统治保持下去。这难道不是一切有良心有正义感的人们所应当具有的共同立场吗？因此，我们一定要坚持美国侵略军及一切外国军队从朝鲜立即全部撤退。只要侵略者的军队撤退了，朝鲜的问题就立刻可以得到和平解决。这难道不是最明白的道理吗？
    我国政府要求美国侵略军退出台湾。试问美国政府究竟有什么理由拒绝这样做呢？我国政府要求在联合国取得合法地位。试问美国政府又有什么理由加以反对呢？美国政府自称它是对中国人民抱着友谊并且是在全世界主持正义的。难道在天地间竟可以设想这样离奇的“友谊”和“正义”吗？或者退出台湾——这就是表明美国停止侵略中国；或者拒绝退出台湾——这就是表明美国侵略中国，而且决心继续侵略中国。或者承认中国在联合国的地位——这就是表明美国愿意和四万七千五百万人讲最起码的道理，愿意和中国在联合国范围内解决问题；或者不承认中国在联合国的地位——这就是表明美国决心对四万七千五百万人横行霸道，不愿意和中国在联合国范围内解决问题。这一切不都是极端地简单和明显的吗？
    因此，周恩来外长代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府发出了郑重的声明说：“中国人民亟望朝鲜战事能得到和平解决。我们坚持以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决为和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判基础，美国侵略军必须退出台湾，中华人民共和国的代表必须取得联合国的合法地位；这几点不但是中国人民和朝鲜人民的合理要求，也是全世界一切进步舆论的迫切愿望。朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题的和平解决，离开这几点是不可能的。”这是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路，此外决无其他道路可走。
