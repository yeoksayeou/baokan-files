    Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Enthusiastically Launch the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Chen Shao
    For over a year, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the political consciousness of Beijing's industrialists and businessmen has generally improved. After Premier Zhou's National Day report, "Strive to Consolidate and Develop the People's Victory," the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce repeatedly invited heads of various trade associations to hold discussions and exchange views on why the Chinese people could not ignore the invasion suffered by our neighboring country, Korea. After extensive and in-depth deliberation and study, industrialists and businessmen generally clarified their past thoughts and concerns of fearing, admiring, and being pro-America, and set off a patriotic upsurge unprecedented in the industrial and commercial circles.

    On November 4th, the various democratic parties of China issued a joint declaration: "Support the people of the whole country to fight against America and aid Korea to defend their homes and defend the country on a voluntary basis." This declaration, representing the will of the entire Chinese people, immediately received enthusiastic support from the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Beijing industrial and commercial circles held a conference on November 7th to resist America, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country. 324 representatives from more than 130 industries in the city attended. The meeting unanimously expressed firm support for the joint declaration of the democratic parties and advocated supporting the just resistance of the Korean people with practical actions. The conference put forward five patriotic pledges.

    All the representatives attending the meeting automatically signed these five patriotic pledges and made solemn vows to guarantee their realization.

    After the Beijing industrial and commercial circles put forward the five patriotic pledges, they immediately became the common goal of the capital's industrialists and businessmen to resist America and aid Korea. Various industries held meetings to discuss and put forward their own voluntary action slogans in conjunction with their own businesses. The mechanized flour industry and the grain industry proposed: "Ensure a sufficient supply of food, no adulteration, and no speculation." The banking industry proposed: "Stabilize finance, do not engage in black market lending, and support all industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood." The machinery and metal manufacturing industry proposed: "Mutual assistance and fraternity, strengthen labor-management unity; do a good job in public-private relations with quality and trustworthiness." The oil, salt, vinegar, and sauce industry proposed: "Ensure an uninterrupted supply of non-staple foods for the masses." The construction industry proposed: "Contribute all our construction experience and capabilities to national defense." The rubber industry proposed: "Step up production, save raw materials, improve quality, and support the front lines." The native products and food industry proposed: "Promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, shoulder the task of bridging the gap, connect the supply and demand of industrial and agricultural products, and assist in the development of production." ...

    The five patriotic pledges, first proposed and guaranteed to be realized by the capital's industrial and commercial circles through practical actions, have also played a certain role in promoting the national industrial and commercial circles.

    On November 21st, the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression was officially established, and a letter of condolences was sent to the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army in the name of the conference. The conference decided on the method for various industries in the capital's industrial and commercial circles to collect慰问品慰问信. The establishment of this committee has further consolidated the organizational strength of the Beijing industrial and commercial circles' movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country. Under the leadership of their own organizations, industrialists and businessmen throughout the city have more systematically and step-by-step implemented the "Five Patriotic Pledges" and "initiated the work of condolence gifts and letters." The movement to resist America and aid Korea in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles has unfolded more enthusiastically under the promotion of this organization.

    On the 6th of this month, after the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was received, the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, after a short two-day preparation, held an unprecedented city-wide industrial and commercial circles celebration of the liberation of Pyongyang and an anti-American imperialist aggression demonstration parade on the glorious "December 9th" patriotic festival. A total of more than 53,000 people from 136 industries throughout the city participated in the parade.

    This demonstration parade was the first time in the history of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles that they had made an angry protest against the imperialists alone. This was a solemn demonstration by all the industrialists and businessmen in Beijing against the American imperialist bandits.

    Fu Huating, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said after the demonstration parade: "This parade is a very good education for the entire industrial and commercial circles in Beijing. In the future, we should continue this spirit, conduct ideological education among our colleagues, turn anger into strength, and use practical actions to ensure the thorough implementation of the Five Patriotic Pledges. Ensure the completion of tax tasks and strictly implement the Common Program. And vow to unite with the people of the whole country to form a united front against imperialist aggression that is more consolidated than in the past, and strive for the final great victory."

    The unprecedented demonstration parade of more than 50,000 people held by the Beijing industrial and commercial circles was not accidental. This is the righteous action of the vast number of industrialists and businessmen who have awakened under the banner of the glorious Mao Zedong, after historical lessons. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that the basis of this demonstration parade by the industrial and commercial circles lies in the fact that the broad masses have long had such a demand!

    In order to continue to promote the patriotic spirit of national industrialists and businessmen across the country, in order to consolidate the victorious achievements of the people's revolutionary cause, and in order to achieve the great victory of the united front of the people of the world against imperialist aggression, the Beijing industrial and commercial circles will unite with the national industrial and commercial circles and the people of the whole country to fight to the end to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country!

    北京市工商界热烈展开抗美援朝运动
    陈绍
    一年多以来，在毛主席和中央人民政府正确领导下，北京工商业者的政治觉悟已经普遍提高了。周总理国庆日的“为巩固和发展人民的胜利而奋斗”报告发表之后，北京市工商联曾先后多次邀集各同业公会负责人举行座谈，就中国人民对于我们的邻邦朝鲜遭受侵略为什么不能置之不理的问题，相互交换了意见。经过了广泛深入的酝酿与学习，一般工商业者澄清了过去存在的恐美、崇美、亲美的思想顾虑，掀起了工商界从来未有的爱国热潮。
    十一月四日中国各民主党派发表了联合宣言：“拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗”。这个代表了全中国人民意志的宣言，立刻获得全国人民热烈的拥护。北京市工商界在工商联合会领导下，于十一月七日举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大会，出席全市一百三十余行业的代表三百二十四人，会中一致表示坚决拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，并主张以实际行动支持朝鲜人民的正义抗战。大会提出五项爱国公约。
    出席大会的全体代表并自动在这五项爱国公约上签名，发表庄严誓言，保证实现。
    北京工商界提出五项爱国公约后，立即成为首都工商业者抗美援朝的一致目标，各行业纷纷集会讨论，并结合本身业务提出自己的志愿行动口号。机制面粉业和粮食业提出：“保证充分供应食粮，不掺假，不投机居奇。”银钱业提出：“稳定金融，不作黑市贷放，扶助一切有利国计民生的工商业。”机器金属制造业提出：“互助友爱，加强劳资团结；以质量和信守搞好公私关系。”油盐醋酱业提出：“保证群众副食品供应无缺。”营造业提出：“把我们一切建设经验和能力贡献到国防上面去。”橡胶业提出：“加紧生产，节省原料，提高品质，支援前线。”土产食品业提出：“促进城乡物资交流，肩起桥梁任务，沟通工农产品供求，协助发展生产。”………
    首都工商界首先提出并以实际行动保证实现的五项爱国公约，在全国工商界中也起了一定的推动作用。
    十一月二十一日北京市工商界保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会正式成立，以大会名义发出向朝鲜人民军和我志愿部队的慰问信。大会决定了首都工商界各行业征集慰问品慰问信的办法。这个委员会的成立，使得北京工商界抗美援朝保家卫国运动的组织力量，更加巩固起来。全市工商业者在自己的组织领导之下，更加有系统、有步骤地执行“五项爱国公约”和“发动慰劳品及慰问信的工作”，北京工商界的抗美援朝运动在这个组织推动之下更加热烈地展开。
    本月六日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤光复的消息传来后，北京市工商界保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会为了庆祝这一伟大胜利，经过了短短两天的筹备，在光荣的“一二、九”爱国节日，举行了空前未有的全市工商界庆祝平壤解放、反对美帝侵略示威游行大会。参加游行的计有全市一百三十六个行业共五万三千多人。
    这次示威游行是北京市工商界有史以来第一次单独向帝国主义者所提出的愤怒的抗议，这是全北京市工商业者对美帝国主义强盗的庄严的示威。
    北京市工商联主委傅华亭在示威游行大会后说：“这次游行对北京市整个工商界是一个很好的教育，今后我们当继续这种精神，向同业进行思想教育，使愤怒化为力量，用实际行动保证五项爱国公约的彻底实现。保证完成税收任务，严格实行共同纲领。并誓与全国人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，争取最后的伟大胜利。”
    北京市工商界举行五万多人空前未有的示威大游行并不是偶然的。这是在光荣的毛泽东旗帜下，经过历史教训，觉醒过来的广大工商业者们的正义行动。彭真同志指出这次工商界示威游行的基础就在于：广大群众早已有了这样的要求！
    为了继续发扬全国民族工商业者热爱祖国的精神，为了巩固人民革命事业胜利的成果，为了取得全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线的巨大胜利，北京市工商界将和全国工商界和全国人民一致团结起来，为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗到底！
