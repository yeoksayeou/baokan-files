The Chegong (Machinery) Department of Zhaoguo
How to Organize Regular Production Emulation Drives
Wang Zeng

First, how to make emulation drives a regular occurrence?

Since June, the Chegong Department of Zhaoguo has held monthly emulation drives, each month with its central theme and different slogans proposed for different periods. In the past, the conditions set were often "complete the task ahead of schedule, guarantee quality, do not be late, do not leave early," etc.; there were no specific goals, and it was very vague how to complete the task and guarantee quality. Later, under "complete the task" and "guarantee quality," numbers were added, stipulating the day to complete or exceed the task by how much, and how many rejects should not be exceeded.

In this way, everyone had specific goals for the emulation drive. Each month, based on the previous month, the most important issues in production in the workshop were put forward as the central content of the emulation drive. For example, the Second Chegong Department had many rejects in the past, 105 in April, 26 in May, and reduced to 6 in June. When the emulation drive was proposed in July, the goal was set not to exceed 10 rejects for the whole month. There were five groups in the entire workshop, and each group's plan proposed not to exceed two rejects; as a result, not a single reject was produced. In August, it was proposed that rejects should not exceed two, and the achievement of not producing a single reject was maintained. After the achievement of no rejects was consolidated, a new central theme was proposed in September - reducing costs. New situations occurred in October, so it was proposed to ensure attendance and insist on production under any circumstances. Over the past five or six months, the emulation drive in the Chegong Department has become a regular occurrence and has achieved great results. The main reason is that there are clear goals. In order to solve the main problems in improving production, the emulation drive is no longer a blind effort without goals. Production is constantly faced with new tasks and new problems, so the emulation drive can become a regular occurrence, improving month by month.

Second, how to abide by and adhere to the system?

After several months of work, the Second Chegong Department established four types of reports (production progress report, quality inspection report, reject cause inspection report, responsibility system inspection report) and six systems (shift handover system, machine care system, tool storage system, compliance with labor discipline, product quality inspection system, responsibility inspection system). With so many systems established, how can workers be made to abide by them? If this issue is not paid attention to, it will become a formality; the charts and graphs on the wall may look colorful, but they are actually ineffective. Here are three examples:

First, the responsibility system was stipulated. On the production responsibility inspection report, a "ten" mark is put under the name of each worker who is responsible, and a "one" mark is put under the name of those who are not. At the beginning, the workers were reluctant to criticize each other, so the report was all "ten" marks. From the report, it looked like the results were all good. The trade union discovered this problem and came up with a way for cadres to take the lead. Once, the organization committee member was irresponsible in one thing, great! Start with him first, and put a "one" mark; hold a self-criticism meeting. Another time, Comrade Wang Zeng himself slept for ten minutes during the night shift, and also put a "one" mark and made a self-criticism. After doing this, it still couldn't be promoted. Some workers said, "The committee member is not responsible, who will he not mark? That's what he should do." When Party members and Youth League members were marked, others said it was also what they should do, so it was necessary to focus on the activists. Once, a worker surnamed Fu lost a wrench. He was not a cadre, nor a Party or Youth League member. The trade union persuaded him to realize his mistake, put a "one" mark under his name, and criticized him in the blackboard newspaper. He also made a self-criticism. From then on, it was considered that face-saving was broken, and anyone who was not responsible could mark themselves, and if they didn't report it themselves, others would report it for them. Second, on the machine protection system, a rule was stipulated that "tools are not allowed to be placed on the machine bed." But if they are not placed on the machine bed, they can't be held either? The trade union came up with a solution and suggested to the administration to issue a small wooden board for each machine bed to place the tools on, thus ensuring this rule. Third, the shift handover system. The Second Chegong Department has two shifts, from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and from 5:00 PM to 1:00 AM. When the second shift gets off work, the first shift is sleeping, and the two shifts don't meet. How can the shift handover system be implemented? The trade union used waste paper to make a handover booklet, and all the matters to be handed over were written in the book. From the above three things, it can be seen that it is not enough to just establish a system. The trade union must also see what difficulties are encountered in the implementation and help find solutions. Everyone will naturally be able to abide by the system.

Third, combine with reality to carry out propaganda and mobilization

Propaganda and mobilization work must be maintained regularly, and it cannot be put aside after holding a meeting and talking about it once; in that case, the workers will not have a deep impression. At the beginning, in order to eliminate rejects, a system was established - "ten minutes after the meeting." No matter what meeting is held, set aside ten minutes to talk about quality issues. The meeting originally scheduled to be held at one o'clock is only held for fifty minutes, and the remaining ten minutes are used by the trade union to talk about reject issues, combining with the rejects that have occurred on site to explain that if a reject is produced, it will not only affect the reputation of the entire workshop, but also deduct the worker's wages (piece-rate system). After talking about it often, everyone can have a deep impression, knowing that producing a reject is first a shame, and second, wages will be deducted, so they pay attention to it at all times.

The blackboard newspaper of the Second Chegong Department was rated as the first in the entire factory. Why? It is because it can be combined with reality. There are three blocks, one for writing factory news, one for political current affairs, and one for technical learning. They are respectively responsible by the cultural and educational committee member and the technician. Where does the content come from? For example, for "technical learning," the trade union heard that someone didn't know how to hang the gear wheels, so they quickly asked the technician to write down the algorithm. This way, doing it according to the needs of the masses is welcomed by everyone.

In addition to the blackboard newspaper, there are various forms such as cartoons, slogans, and reject charts. Whoever produces a reject is found out the reason for the reject and a picture is drawn for him. If he corrects it, quickly replace it with another one to encourage and praise him.

Fourth, how was the patriotic production emulation drive launched?

In October, because the 1950 task had been completed and new tasks had not been issued, the work was not tight, so no new emulation drive was proposed at the beginning. Around mid-October, American imperialism frantically expanded its aggression, crossed the 38th parallel, and burned the flames of war to our Northeast. It also constantly sent planes to invade our Northeast airspace, bombing and strafing. The situation became increasingly serious. After studying the current situation, all the workers were very enthusiastic about resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and the country. According to the situation at the time, the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League of the Second Chegong Department decided to launch an emulation drive. The first step was to challenge the workshops in the factory; the second step was to contact the manufacturing section to sign a contract to ensure that the work would not be interrupted (because the 1950 task had been completed and production was not normal); the third step was to make group plans to ensure that the plans of the entire workshop were fulfilled. On this basis, it was proposed to challenge the workers in Northeast China.

The formulation of the emulation drive plan was done from top to bottom and from bottom to top. First, it was studied by the workshop Party, government, trade union, and Youth League and the workshop committee to propose preliminary conditions for the challenge, which were discussed and revised by each group and signed and sealed by the entire group.

After the emulation drive is launched, there must be inspection and awards. A weekly evaluation system was established, with the group as the unit, to evaluate once a week, determining seven items such as quantity, quality, safety, responsibility system, and cost accounting, and assigning scores according to the importance and secondary importance of each item. In the past, when it came to inspection and awards, everyone quarreled and there was no standard. Everyone said they were good. This time, it was easy to handle. After the inspection in October, the inspection method was improved again in November. The inspection team was led by the chairman of the workshop committee, with the participation of Party, government, trade union, and Youth League cadres, and was directly responsible by the production wage committee. Doing this is better than organizing a separate inspection committee in the past, reducing a layer of organization, and saving the inspection committee from replacing the production wage committee.

The Chegong Department of Zhaoguo received a certificate of merit written by Chairman Mao himself at the National Model Worker Representatives Conference: "Model on the Production Front." All the workers felt extremely honored. This time, American imperialism wanted to invade our motherland and destroy our production and construction. The workers were furious and wanted to contribute everything to the country, resist America and aid Korea, and defend their homes and the country, so their production enthusiasm was particularly high. The factory leaders also gave particularly heavy tasks, but no one was scared back by the tasks. Everyone said, "In order to resist America and aid Korea, we should not waste a minute and give our all. We should do as much as we can!" This is all because the actual life of the workers in Shenyang has been educated and raised their awareness in the two years since liberation.

Because the task was heavy, the workers initially wanted to work overtime. The trade union and the administration did not agree. Because there are many temporary tasks now for resisting America and aiding Korea, constantly working overtime will exhaust people. But the workers insisted on working overtime and proposed not to pay for overtime, and argued very fiercely with the trade union; in the end, one day was added. The next day, the trade union persuaded everyone, calling on everyone not to rely on physical strength, but to use their brains to transform tools and improve technology. In this way, in six days, the task that required 3,500 work hours was completed (if calculated according to the on-site equipment and manpower, there were only 2,204 work hours in six days), and 1,296 work hours of work were done more.

The attendance rate was 91% in September, and after the emulation drive in late October, it has risen to 95.6%. In November, all marriage, funeral, and sick leave were included, maintaining 98%.

Fifth, how were the achievements obtained?

The Second Chegong Department achieved these achievements, first because it learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group. Second, Zhao Guoyou played a leading, backbone, and bridge role, and he constantly introduced advanced Soviet experience, and the workers trusted him very much. Third, the unity within the working class was strengthened, and the workers, technicians, and staff closely cooperated to overcome difficulties, put forward rationalization proposals, transform tools, and improve technology. Fourth, the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League acted in unison, and the Party and the administration supported the trade union. Furthermore, the trade union itself overcame bureaucracy and deeply led production; this month, a sound meeting system was established, with clear division of labor, inspection, and summary, and it cared about the hardships of the workers, could closely contact the masses, and thus won the support of the masses.

    赵国有车工部
    怎样组织经常性的生产竞赛
    王曾
    第一、怎样才能使竞赛成为经常性的
    赵国有车工部从六月份以来，月月竞赛，每个月有每个月的中心内容，不同时期提出不同的口号来。过去订的条件，常常是“提前完成任务、保证质量、不迟到、不早退”等等；没有具体目标，到底怎么才算完成了任务和保证了质量，都很笼统。以后就在“完成任务”“保证质量”下面，加上数目字，规定出到那一天完成或超过多少任务，不出多少废品。
    这样一来，大家有了具体的竞赛目标。每个月都在上月基础上提出本车间生产上最主要的问题，作为竞赛的中心内容。比如第二车工部过去废品多，四月份有一○五件，五月份还有二十六件，六月份减少到六件，七月份提出竞赛时，定的目标是全月不超过十件，全车间有五个小组，每个组的计划里，提出不超过两件；结果没出一件废品。八月份又提出废品不得超过两件，保持了没出一件废品。不出废品的成绩巩固以后，在九月份就提出了新的中心内容——降低成本。十月份发生了新的情况，就又提出了保证出勤率，保证在任何情况下，都坚持生产。这五、六个月来，车工部的竞赛成为经常性的，并且收到很大效果，主要原因就是有明确的目标。为了解决当前提高生产中的主要问题，竞赛不再是没有目标的乱干了。生产中不断有新的任务和新的问题，所以竞赛能够成为经常性的，一个月比一个月提高。
    第二、怎样才能遵守和坚持制度
    经过几个月功夫，第二车工部建立了四种表报（生产进度表、质量检查表、废品原因检查表、责任制检查表）、六种制度（交接班制、爱护机器制、工具保管制、遵守劳动纪律、产品质量检查制、责任检查制）。建立了这么多制度，怎么能叫职工遵守呢？要不注意这个问题，就会成了形式；看起来满墙花花绿绿的图表，实际上不起作用。有三个例子：
    第一、规定了负责制。在生产责任检查表上每个工人名下，负责任的打一个“十”号，不负责打一个“一”号。乍一开始时，工人打不开情面，所以表上都是“十”号，从表上一看成绩都挺好。工会发觉了这个毛病，就想出干部带头的办法来，有一次组织委员有一件事没负责，好！就从他先开刀，画一个“一”号；开了个检讨会。还有一次，王曾同志自己夜班睡了十分钟，也画上“一”号，作了检讨。这么做了以后，还带不起来，有的工人就说：“委员不负责，他不画谁画，那是应该的。”党员团员画上了，别人也说是应该的，所以还得抓住积极分子才行。又有一次一个姓傅的工人丢了搬子，他不是干部，也不是党团员，工会就说服他，让他认识自己不对，给他名下画上了“一”号，又在黑板报上批评，他自己也作了检讨。从这以后，才算打开了情面，谁不负责都能自己画上，自己不报，别人也给他报告了。第二、在保护机器制上，规定了一条“工具不准往床子上放”，可是不往床子上放，也不能捧着啊？工会就想出办法，建议行政，发给每台床子一块小木板，把工具放在板上，这样就保证了这一条。第三、交接班制。第二车工部是两班，上午七点到下午五点，下午五点到晚间一点，第二班下班，第一班都在睡觉，两班见不着面，怎么实行交接班制呢？工会就利用废纸，订个交班册子，该交代的事，都写在本子上。从上面三件事，可见不光立出制度就算完事，工会还得看看执行当中遇到什么困难，帮助想办法，大家自然而然地就能遵守制度了。
    第三、结合实际来宣传鼓动
    宣传鼓动工作，一定要保持经常，不能开一个会，讲过一次就搁开它；那样，工人印象不深。开始时候，为了消灭废品，定下个制度——“会后十分钟”，不管开什么会，留出十分钟来讲质量问题。本来规定开一点钟的会，只开它五十分钟，剩下十分钟由工会讲废品问题，结合现场发生的废品，说明废了一件，不但影响全车间名誉，并且还得扣本人工资（计件制）。讲常了，每个人都能有个深刻印象，知道废了活，第一是耻辱，第二还扣工资，也就时刻注意了。
    第二车工部的黑板报，在全厂评为第一。为什么呢？就是能结合实际。一共有三块，一块写的是工厂通讯，一块是政治时事，一块是技术学习。分别由文教委员和技术员负责。内容怎么来的呢？比如“技术学习”，工会听到有人说不会挂牙轮，赶紧就请技术员把算法写上。这样根据群众需要来做，就受大家欢迎。
    除了黑板报，还有漫画、标语、废品榜等各种形式，谁出了废品，就找到他出废品的原因，给他画上。要是改了，就赶快再给他换上一个，鼓励表扬他。
    第四、怎样发动了爱国主义生产竞赛
    十月份里，因为一九五○年任务已经完成，新的任务没有下来，活不紧，所以一开始没有提出新的竞赛。到十月半前后，美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略，越过三八线，把战火烧向咱们东北，又不断派飞机侵犯我东北领空，轰炸扫射。情况越来越严重，经过时事学习，全体职工抗美援朝保家卫国的情绪非常高。根据当时情况，第二车工部党、政、工、团决定发动竞赛。第一步先向厂内各车间挑战；第二步和制造科订联系合同，保证活不间断（因为一九五○年任务已完成，生产不正常）；第三步订小组计划，保证全车间计划，说到做到。在这样基础上，提出向全东北工人挑战。
    订竞赛计划是用自上而下，自下而上的办法。先经过车间党政工团和车间委员会研究，提出一个挑战的初步条件，由各小组讨论修改，全组签名盖章。
    发动了竞赛，一定要有检查和评奖。建立了周评制，以小组为单位，一周评一次，定出数量、质量、保安、责任制、成本核算等七项，按照每一项的重要、次要定出分数来。过去一到检查评奖时，大伙乱吵吵，也没个标准，谁都说谁好，这回这么一来，可就好办啦。经过十月份的检查，十一月在检查办法上，又有了改进，检查组由车间委员会主席领导，聘请党政工团干部参加，由生产工资委员会直接负责。这样做，比以前单另组织检查委员会好，减少了一层组织，又省得检查委员会代替生产工资委员会。
    赵国有车工部，在全国劳模代表会议上，得到毛主席亲笔写的奖状：“生产战线上的模范”，全体职工感到无上光荣。这回美帝国主义要来侵犯咱们祖国，破坏咱们的生产建设，职工们怒火万丈，要把自己一切贡献给国家，抗美援朝，保家卫国，所以生产热情特别高。厂的领导上，也给了特别繁重的任务，大伙都没有叫任务吓回去。大伙说：“咱们为了抗美援朝，应该一分钟也不浪费，尽全部力量，能做多少做多少！”这都是沈阳解放两年来的实际生活教育了工人，提高了觉悟。
    因为任务重，工人起初要加班加点，工会和行政不同意。因为现在抗美援朝，临时任务很多，老是加班加点，就会把人累坏。可是工人坚持要加班，并且提出加班不要钱，和工会争得非常激烈；最后，加了一天。第二天工会说服大家，号召大家不要硬拚体力，应该动脑筋，改造工具，提高技术。这样，在六天里，完成了需要三千五百工时的任务（如果按现场设备人力算，六天只有二千二百零四个工时），多干出一千二百九十六个工时的活来。
    出勤率，九月份是百分之九十一，十月下旬竞赛以后，已上升到百分之九十五点六，十一月所有婚丧病假都算在内，保持了百分之九十八。
    第五、成绩怎么得来的
    第二车工部得到这些成绩，第一是因为学习了马恒昌小组经验。第二是赵国有起了带头、骨干、桥梁作用，他又不断地介绍苏联先进经验，工人很信任他。第三是加强了工人阶级内部的团结，工人、技术人员和职员，密切合作，克服困难，提出合理化建议，改造工具，提高技术。第四是党、政、工、团步调一致，党和行政支持工会。再就是工会本身克服了事务主义，深入领导生产；本月又建立了健全的会议制度，分工明确，有检查、有总结，并且关心职工疾苦，能密切联系群众，所以得到了群众的拥护。
