Xinhua News Agency, 21st. The Chinese delegation attending the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, led by delegation leader Guo Moruo, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 21st. Those who went to the station to welcome them included: Central People's Government Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Government Administration Council Vice Premier Huang Yanpei, Secretary-General Li Weihan and heads of various departments and provinces, China Peace Committee Vice Chairmen Chen Shutong, Situ Meitang, Li Lisan, Shen Junru, Shao Lizi, Hu Qiaomu, Xu Baoju, Peng Zemin, Luo Longji, and Zhang Bojun and Xiao San, members of the delegation who returned home earlier, Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the China Peace Committee, Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, institutions, and schools, more than 1,500 people.

    The delegation's special train arrived at the station at 9:20 AM. The representatives got off the train amidst the national anthem and cheers, and accepted flowers from representatives of various organizations. The welcome meeting was then held on the platform.

    Chen Shutong and Zhang Xiruo delivered welcome speeches one after another, warmly welcoming the delegation's triumphant return amidst the victorious sounds of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    In his reply, Guo Moruo said: The Second World Congress in Warsaw has achieved great results. It tells the people of the world: We must not wait for peace, we must strive for peace! To defend peace, we must oppose aggression. Today, this means opposing the aggression of American imperialism, which is destroying peace in the Far East and threatening world peace. The Warsaw Congress unanimously condemned the American imperialists and the war demon MacArthur, demanding that the invading troops of American imperialism and its vassal states withdraw from Korea, and demanding that the invading troops of American imperialism withdraw from Taiwan. The Warsaw Congress also adopted many important resolutions. The Chinese delegation reported to the Congress on the Chinese people's determination to defend peace, and the suggestions made by the delegation were adopted by the Congress. We should deeply thank Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, thank the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, and thank all the Chinese people who are participating in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect their homes and defend the country. The Chinese people's just movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country, and the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, gave great encouragement to the Warsaw Congress. The Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country has received the support of peace-loving people all over the world. Guo Moruo finally emphasized: Our people must strengthen unity, and carry out this patriotic movement more widely and deeply, to smash the American imperialists' aggressive plans. This is our people's great contribution to the cause of defending world peace. At the end of the welcome meeting, the welcoming masses shouted slogans such as "Oppose imperialist aggression, defend world peace!" "Long live the great unity of the peace-loving people of the world!"
