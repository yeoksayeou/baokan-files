Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The French army, which is invading Vietnam, has continuously violated our border areas with aircraft. In addition to bombarding our territory with artillery fire, its ground forces are openly shielding and assisting Kuomintang bandits in carrying out harassment activities in our Yunnan border areas.

Regarding the Guangxi border: Following the bombing of Tianbao County on October 19th, French aircraft intruded into our Guangxi territory six times between November 10th and 23rd, with a total of seventeen aircraft. Among them, they intruded into the airspace above Ai Dian Pass, a key border town, four times for reconnaissance, and on November 11th at 10:20 AM, they again intruded into the airspace above Tianbao County, circling between Tianbao and Jingxi counties for reconnaissance for as long as forty minutes.

Regarding the Guangdong border: French ground forces shelled and fired upon our Guangdong border areas six times in six days, from November 4th to 9th. Among them, on November 9th at 12:00 PM, when representatives of the people of Fangcheng County were en route to the county seat for a meeting, they were fired upon by French troops from within the territory south of the city, when they passed Pengzu Ridge. Shen Jiwan, a representative of our people, was wounded. The bullet entered from the left side of the spine at the waist, and the bullet head did not exit. The injury is quite serious.

Regarding the Yunnan border: Since May, the French army invading Vietnam and the Bao Dai puppet army under its command have frequently invaded our Yunnan border to assist the bandits led by Ning Ruinan and Han Sixue in creating disturbances, and have regularly supplied the bandit troops with food and ammunition. When the two bandits were pursued by our forces, they were covered and allowed to retreat into Vietnam's Zhelan and Mengkang. The French army and Bao Dai army have also crossed the border to rob our compatriots of cattle and horses, forcibly relocating residents of villages and towns such as Tiantianfang, Kafang, Dongping, and Maqiyi to Binh Lang Village in Vietnam, and have demolished and burned down the houses of the residents of Wangjiaoka village on our border. At midnight on October 28th, the French army fired approximately three hundred shots at our Hekou City from Lao Cai. He Yuxian (female), a resident, was shot in her bedroom, suffering a wound to the back of her neck. On November 14th, the Mengyi state official (equivalent to a county magistrate) of the French puppet Bao Dai regime led more than thirty soldiers to intrude into Nandashu in Jiangcheng, more than ten miles inside our territory, kidnapped three of our compatriots, and robbed all the yellow cattle from the entire village. As for incidents of French aircraft crossing the border to provoke, there were as many as fifty-one instances in the ten days from October 21st to 31st, including eight strafing incidents. On November 11th at 11:00 AM, three French aircraft again intruded into the airspace above our Hekou City and dropped a bomb two kilometers northeast of the city.

The Chinese government has investigated and recorded all the above-mentioned instances of French aircraft and ground forces invading the borders of our Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces, and relevant evidence has been photographed.
