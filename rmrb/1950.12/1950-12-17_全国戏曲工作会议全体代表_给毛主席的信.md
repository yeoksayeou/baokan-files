To our dear Chairman Mao:

Under the slogan of "Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" instructed by you, we have conducted fourteen days of intensive meetings. This meeting has yielded important gains in understanding the central policies and guidelines, learning about the specific situations in various regions, exchanging work experience, and especially in uniting artists from various regions and enhancing their love for the motherland and the people.

The people of the whole country have been liberated under your leadership, and the artists have also been liberated, turning from a position of being insulted and harmed to the position of masters and teachers of the people. This is exciting. Hao Shouchen, who had left the stage for ten years, has shaved off his beard and is singing for the people again. Liu Xikui, who had been mute for thirty-three years after suffering untold torment, has regained her voice. When she marched in the anti-American parade, she shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" with tears of gratitude in her eyes, a voice truly coming from the bottom of her heart! But the artists also know that if they do not combine the art cause with the current revolutionary struggle, serve the people, and serve the defense of the motherland, they will not be able to consolidate the fruits of victory. We swear to you: After we return to our respective posts, we will resolutely implement the central policies and guidelines, wholeheartedly strive to create patriotic people's opera, and earnestly carry out the transformation and education of artists, strengthen political, cultural, and professional learning, and transform the more than 300,000 artists and masses into a genuine "new literary and artistic army," following your victorious banner forward.

All Representatives of the National Opera Work Conference, December 10th

    全国戏曲工作会议全体代表            
    给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    在您指示的“推陈出新”的口号下我们进行了十四天紧张的会议。这会议对于认识中央政策方针，了解各地具体情况，交换工作经验，尤其是团结各地艺人，增强其对于祖国的爱，人民的爱，是得到了重要的收获。
    全国人民在您的领导下翻了身，艺人们也翻了身，从被侮辱，被损害的地位翻身到主人的地位，人民教师的地位。这是使人兴奋的。郝寿臣辞了舞台十年于今去掉胡子重为人民歌唱了。受尽折磨哑了三十三年的刘喜奎，又出声了。她在抗美游行的时候含着感激的眼泪，高呼“毛主席万岁！”那真是从心坎里发出来的声音啊！但艺人们也知道若不把艺术事业与当前革命斗争结合，为人民服务，为保卫祖国服务，就不能巩固胜利的果实。我们向您宣誓：我们回到各人自己岗位之后，将坚决执行中央政策方针，全心全意为创造爱国主义的人民戏曲而奋斗，并认真展开艺人改造教育，加强政治文化业务学习，把三十余万艺人群众变成真正的“新文艺大军”，跟着您的胜利的旗帜前进。
    全国戏曲工作会议全体代表  十二月十日
