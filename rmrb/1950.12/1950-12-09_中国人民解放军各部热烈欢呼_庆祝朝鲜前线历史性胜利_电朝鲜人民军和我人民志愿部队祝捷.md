Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army enthusiastically cheers the historic and enormous victory of the great counteroffensive on the Korean front and the recapture of Pyongyang. On the very day the good news of the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army liberating Pyongyang reached the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, commanders and fighters of various units gathered to celebrate. In their congratulatory telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, forwarded to the China Peace Committee in Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression, they said: "You are gloriously standing on the front lines against the American imperialist war of aggression, fighting shoulder to shoulder heroically and tenaciously in the freezing cold, powerfully striking at the fierce flames of the American imperialist aggressor troops, and achieving brilliant victories time and time again. The people of all of China, all of Asia, and all the world are celebrating and cheering your great historic victory."

The entire body of officers and soldiers of the Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army sent telegrams to the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the 2nd and 7th of this month to congratulate them on the victorious offensive on the Korean front. The congratulatory telegram on the 2nd stated: "We read with immense excitement the news of your crushing defeat of the American aggressor troops and the Li pseudo-army. Your brilliant achievements prove that the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people can defeat the mad aggression of American imperialism." The telegram on the 7th congratulating the liberation of Pyongyang also stated: "This great victory is a loud warning to the American imperialist aggressors: the united strength of the world's peace-loving and democratic people is incomparably powerful."

The congratulatory telegrams from East China and Northwest China both wished the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army continued close unity, to completely eliminate the American aggressor troops and the Li bandit army, liberate all of Korea, and achieve final victory.

Many commanders and fighters of the Fourth Field Army joyfully congratulated the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people. Many soldiers applauded enthusiastically after hearing the good news. Zhu Huanyou, a people's meritorious officer from a certain garrison unit, said: "This victory has dealt a severe blow to the mad drive of American imperialism. If it dares to expand its aggressive actions, it will suffer an even more tragic defeat." Li Baocang, a soldier from a certain regiment, humorously said: "MacArthur has replaced Chiang Kai-shek as the 'transportation captain'!" The "Political Work" newspaper of a certain unit published an editorial calling on the commanders and fighters of the unit to learn from the tenacious, indomitable, and heroic fighting spirit of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to promote the revolutionary heroism of overwhelming any imperialist aggressors, and to fight to defend the motherland.

    庆祝朝鲜前线历史性胜利
    电朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿部队祝捷
    【新华社八日讯】中国人民解放军热烈欢呼朝鲜前线大反攻和克复平壤的历史性的巨大胜利。朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军光复平壤的捷音传到华东军区暨第三野战军的当天，各部指挥员、战斗员即集会庆祝。他们在给中国保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会转致朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体指战员的贺电中说：“你们光荣地站在反对美帝国主义侵略战争的最前线，在冰天雪地之中，英勇顽强地并肩作战，有力地打击了美帝国主义侵略军的凶焰，一次再次地获得了辉煌的胜利。全中国、全亚洲、全世界的人民都为你们的伟大的历史性的胜利而庆祝，而欢呼。”
    西北军区暨第一野战军的全体指战员曾先后于本月二日、七日两次致电朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军祝贺朝鲜前线的胜利攻势。在二日的贺电中说：“我们以万分兴奋的心情读了你们痛歼美国侵略军和李伪军的捷报。你们的辉煌战绩证明了中朝人民的紧密团结是可以打败美帝国主义的疯狂侵略的。”在七日祝贺平壤光复的电文中又说：“这一巨大胜利，响亮地警告了美帝国主义侵略者：世界和平民主人民团结的力量是强大无比的。”
    华东和西北的贺电都预祝朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军继续亲密团结，为全部消灭美国侵略军和李匪军，解放整个朝鲜，获得最后的胜利。
    第四野战军的许多指战员都欢欣地祝贺朝中人民的伟大胜利。很多战士听到捷音后都热烈地鼓掌。某警备部队人民功臣朱焕有说：“这个胜利给了美帝国主义的疯狂劲儿一个严重的打击。它如果胆敢扩大侵略行动，那它就要遭到更悲惨的失败。”某团战士李宝仓幽默地说：“麦克阿瑟代替蒋介石来当‘运输大队长’啦！”某部的“政治工作”报发表社论，号召该部指战员向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的坚毅顽强、英勇作战的精神学习，发扬压倒任何帝国主义侵略者的革命英雄主义的气概，为捍卫祖国而斗争。
