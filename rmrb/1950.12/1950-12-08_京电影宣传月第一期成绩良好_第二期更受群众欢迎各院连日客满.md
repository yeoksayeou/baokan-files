    The early showings of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland film promotion month, jointly organized by the North China Film Management Company, the Beijing Cinema Industry Association, and the Beijing Film Industry Trade Union, began on November 24th, with exceptionally enthusiastic audiences at all theaters. As of December 3rd, the total number of viewers in the first phase at the five cinemas—Da Guangming, Mingxing, Pingan, Da Guan Lou, and Dazhong—had reached 31,385. The average attendance rate per theater exceeded 100%. The Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland film promotion campaign was launched, igniting patriotic fervor among the masses to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland. At the same time, the Science Popularization Bureau's slide shows and the Quyi Association's new Quyi performances, in coordinated promotion, strengthened the content of this promotion. They also played their due role among the masses. Now, the second phase is continuing at six theaters—Youth Palace, Beijing, Hongxing, Central, Tongle, and Honglou—with each theater packed daily, drawing even larger audiences than the first phase.
