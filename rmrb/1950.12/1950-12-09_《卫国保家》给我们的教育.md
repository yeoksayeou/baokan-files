    "Defending the Country and Protecting the Home" Teaches Us
    Méi Lìngyí
    "Defending the Country and Protecting the Home" is a good film produced by the Northeast Film Studio about the anti-Chiang war. This film is being screened today in four theaters in Beijing: Capital, Dahua, New China, and Changong. This film is based on Tao Dun's "Yang Gui Xiang Ballad." Wang Zhenzhi wrote the screenplay, and Yan Gong directed. The film, through the realistic character of Chen Guiying and her life, gives us a warning of serious significance: after the victory of the revolution, we must not forget our roots, and we must not put personal interests first and revolutionary interests second.
    Chen Guiying, a young girl in the countryside, was exploited and oppressed in her home by the landlord and traitor Liu Erhuai in the Japanese-occupied area. She was forced to be betrothed to Liu Erhuai as his concubine. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army came, and the county magistrate declared this illegal marriage contract invalid. After that, Chen Guiying overcame various difficulties to lead the textile group, became a model worker, and was elected captain of the village's youth women's team. At this time, her family's situation had improved, and she was engaged to Yang Dezhi, a neighboring village militia hero, hoping to defeat the Japanese invaders soon and share peace and prosperity.
    On August 15th, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China, and the militia, in coordination with the main force of the Eighth Route Army, launched a major counter-offensive. The Japanese invaders were defeated. However, American imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, would never let the Chinese people "share peace and prosperity." The Chinese people needed to be more vigilant, redouble their efforts to defend the fruits of victory, and not allow the reactionaries to plunder them. Chen Guiying just happened to neglect the necessity of this vigilance and wholeheartedly began to plan for her own personal interests. She was busy making her wedding dress and had no time to preside over the youth women's team meeting to discuss support-the-army work. The masses were dissatisfied with her, and she quarreled with them. She said:
    "Hmph! I, Chen Guiying, have worked in Chenjia Village for so long. If I can't say I have made any contributions, I can at least say I have worked hard! I didn't expect that when things came to me, everyone would..."
    The old village chief's opinion was completely correct: "After the victory, some people relax everything because they are greedy for a good life and fantasize about peace. This kind of thinking must be examined among the cadres."
    The Party worker Li Yutian's words were also completely correct. In the past, she had not helped Chen Guiying well to raise her class consciousness and remind Chen Guiying to think about where her happy life came from and what kind of suffering she had suffered in the past. She said: "I didn't expect that the victory of a struggle would be followed by an even more arduous struggle. Anyone who doesn't understand this principle will definitely fall behind!"
    Chen Guiying did not completely forget, and she also understood the principles Li Yutian spoke of. With the help of the Party and the supervision of the masses, her thinking of forgetting her roots was corrected in time and did not continue to develop. When she examined herself in front of the masses, she spoke very frankly and sincerely:
    "I am sorry to everyone, sorry to the Communist Party! ... I only cared about enjoying life in front of me and forgot the revolution! ... I will definitely use my actions to answer everyone!"
    Chen Guiying was lucky. During the three years of the Liberation War, she was elected village chief and welcomed the victorious return of the demobilized soldier Yang Dezhi.
    This film gives us a great education. Now that we have defeated the Chiang bandit gang and expelled the American imperialist forces, it is easier for people without thorough class consciousness to be overwhelmed by victory. The saying "If I can't say I have made any contributions, I can at least say I have worked hard" is essentially a manifestation of the pride and complacency of those who consider themselves meritorious officials. Not long ago, the People's Daily editorial "Overcoming the Pride and Complacency of Considering Oneself a Meritorious Official" (October 10, 1950) profoundly pointed this out. "After the basic victory of the great people's revolution in our country, there has been more or less a kind of pride and complacency of considering oneself a meritorious official. ... Even to the point of coveting personal enjoyment and embarking on the road of corruption and degeneration." Its source "is due to the selfishness and self-interest of the petty bourgeoisie, putting personal interests first and revolutionary interests second," "only caring about personal enjoyment, becoming short-sighted vulgar little people." Vulgar little people - not only will they fall behind themselves, but they will also hinder the revolution!
    Today, we still have to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet; today we still have to fight to eliminate the remaining Chiang bandit special agents on the mainland. We also have to fight to defend world peace and oppose the new war provocateurs headed by American imperialism. The task is great. Only by completing these tasks can everyone truly live a good life. We "must not only be able to withstand the test in arduous, difficult, and even failed revolutionary struggles, but also be able to withstand the test in smooth, successful, and victorious revolutionary struggles. We must never be overwhelmed by victory..." (quoted from the same source)
    The ending of the film "Defending the Country and Protecting the Home" also touches on this point. Yang Dezhi, representing the soldiers returning home to participate in production, said:
    "Now, the war on the mainland, we have already won. However, American imperialism still supports the reactionaries and invades Taiwan! ... We have the strength to smash the American imperialist invasion plot and eliminate the remaining armed forces of the Chiang bandit gang. We must liberate Taiwan!"

    《卫国保家》给我们的教育
    梅令宜
    《卫国保家》是东北制片厂摄制的反蒋战争的一部好影片。这部影片今天在北京市首都、大华、新中国、蟾宫四院放映。这部影片取材于陶钝的“杨桂香鼓词”。由王震之编剧，严恭导演。片中通过陈桂英这样一个现实的人物和她的生活，给与我们一个有着严重意义的警惕：革命胜利后不可忘本，不可把个人利益放在第一位而把革命利益放在第二位。
    陈桂英，一个农村中的少女，在日寇侵占区内，家里受着地主汉奸刘二坏的剥削压迫，她被强迫许给刘二坏做二房。幸而八路军来了，这个非法婚约由县长宣判无效。此后，陈桂英克服种种困难领导了纺织小组，成为劳动模范，并且被选为村中青妇队队长。这时，家里的光景已经变好，她也和邻村民兵英雄杨得志订婚了，希望早点打垮日寇，共亨太平。
    八·一五苏联出兵东北，民兵配合八路军主力大举反攻，日寇是被打垮了。但美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮决不会让中国人民“共亨太平”，中国人民有必要提高警惕，加倍努力保卫胜利果实，不容反动派劫夺。陈桂英恰好忽略了这种警惕的必要，一心一意的为个人打算起来。她忙着做嫁衣，没心思主持青妇队开会讨论拥军工作。群众不满意她，就跟群众闹翻了。她说：
    “哼！我陈桂英，在陈家村工作了这么久，说不上有什么功劳，总算有点苦劳吧！想不到事情轮到我身上大伙儿就……”
    老村长的意见完全对：“胜利以后，有的人就因为贪恋过好日子，幻想和平，就把一切都放松啦，这种思想一定要在干部当中检查一下。”
    党工作人员李玉田的话也完全对，她过去没有很好的帮助陈桂英提高阶级觉悟，提醒陈桂英想想幸福的生活是从那里来的，过去受的是什么样的苦。她说：“没想到一个斗争的胜利，跟着来的，就是更艰苦的斗争，谁不明白这个道理，谁就一定会掉队！”
    陈桂英并没有完全忘记，也懂得李玉田所讲的道理。在党的帮助与群众的督促下，她的忘本思想及时的得到了纠正，不曾继续发展下去。她在群众面前检讨自己的时候说得很坦白诚恳：
    “我对不起大家，对不起共产党！……我只顾眼前的享乐生活，忘记了革命！……我一定用我的行动来回答大家！”
    陈桂英是幸运的。在三年解放战争中，她被选为村长，欢迎了参军民兵杨得志的胜利归来。
    这部影片给我们很大的教育。在打垮了蒋匪帮并驱逐了美帝势力的现在，没有彻底的阶级觉悟的人们更容易被胜利冲昏了头脑。“说不上有什么功劳总算有点苦劳”的说法，在实质上，就是以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪的流露。不久以前，人民日报社论《克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪》（一九五○年十月十日）曾深刻地指出了这一点。“在我国人民大革命取得基本胜利之后，或多或少地滋长着一种以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。………甚至于贪图个人享乐，走向腐化堕落的道路。”其来源“是由于小资产阶级的自私自利性，以个人利益放在第一位，把革命利益放在第二位”，“只计较个人的享受，变成目光短小的庸俗小人了。”庸俗小人——不但自己会掉队，而且会妨碍革命！
    今天，我们还要为了解放台湾与西藏进行斗争；今天我们还要为了肃清大陆上的残余蒋匪特务分子而斗争。我们还要为了保卫世界和平、反对以美帝为首的新战争挑拨者而斗争，任务是重大的，只有完成了这些任务，大家才能真正过好日子。我们“不但要在艰苦的困难的甚至失败的革命斗争中受得起考验，而且要在顺利的成功的胜利的革命斗争中受得起考验。决不可因胜利而冲昏头脑………”（引同上）
    影片《卫国保家》的结尾，也接触了这一点。杨得志代表回乡生产的战士说：
    “现在，战争在大陆上，我们已经胜利啦。可是，美帝国主义还要支持反动派，侵略台湾！……咱们有力量来粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，消灭蒋匪帮的残余武力，咱们一定要解放台湾！”
