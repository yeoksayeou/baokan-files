    A Typical Example of Praising New People
    —Thoughts After Watching "Steel Will"

    The film "Steel Will," adapted from the non-fiction novel "A Real Man" by Soviet writer Boris Polevoi, like many other Soviet literary works and films, is a work that sings the praises of new people as typical examples.
    When we mention typical examples of new people, some people often find it difficult to understand its full significance.
    In fact, they are people who have grown up through countless unyielding struggles and under the long-term education of the truth of Lenin and Stalin, possessing humanity's lofty ideals and incomparably strong will.
    In March 1942, Soviet Air Force Captain Alexei Meresyev, a fighter pilot, was shot down by German bandits in a forest occupied by them. He dragged his two wounded and festering feet, crawling for eighteen days in the icy and snowy forest, rampant with wild beasts and German bandits, and finally encountered Soviet guerrillas fighting the German bandits in the forest, who rescued him. Later, in the hospital, the doctor amputated his two legs and fitted him with a pair of prosthetics. "Happy people! Flying, fighting, and now I can no longer fly." When Alexei lay in the hospital bed thinking about this seemingly irreversible thing, how sad he was, how painful. However, even this pain did not frustrate the hero's ideals and his strong will, because as the beloved regimental political commissar Vorobyov and Alexei himself said, he was a Soviet man.
    Yes, a Soviet man, a person who grew up under the most ideal social system in the world. The truth of Lenin and Stalin nurtured them to grow into the most perfect people in the world. They have the deepest love for their country and their ideals. So they completed the cause of new heroism and patriotism with incomparable determination. So we saw Alexei, with a pair of prosthetic legs, dancing again, and finally, he flew again, in the sky of the motherland, chasing the enemies who dared to invade them,...
    Today, such typical examples of new people and new heroes are growing not only in the Soviet Union but also in places illuminated by the truth of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. In China, nurtured by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we have already seen such new people beginning to grow. Under the inspiration of the new heroism and patriotism in resisting American imperialism, we will see the growth of more new heroes and typical examples. Therefore, for us, new people like Alexei Meresyev should be understandable and can be taken as our typical examples. The only ones who can never understand people like Alexei are those who have degenerated from humanity, those who can no longer be called human beings; Hitler, Mussolini, Goering... who have been buried by humanity, and Truman, Acheson, MacArthur... who will be buried by humanity.
    Boris Polevoi, the author of the novel "A Real Man," when he finished this glorious work, in the "epilogue" of the novel, when he narrated why he wrote this work, recorded for us a testimony he personally heard from Goering during the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal:
    "'Do you admit that you attacked the Soviet Union perfidiously, the consequences of which led to the destruction of Germany, which is the greatest crime?' The Soviet prosecutor Roman Rudenko said to Goering.
    "'This is not a crime, it is a fatal mistake,' Goering replied gloomily, lowering his eyes and whispering. 'I can only admit that our actions were too rash, because in the war we realized that there were many things we did not know... mainly, we did not know or understand the Soviet people. They used to be a mystery, and they are still a mystery...'" Then, Polevoi added: "How could these pitiful 'theories' inventors, who sang so loudly that Germany was the 'chosen race of God', understand the soul and power of a person growing up in a socialist country!"
    Now, American imperialism is repeating the "fatal mistake" that German fascism did not understand until its death in Asia. On the Korean battlefield, they also do not understand the Chinese and Korean people. Some time ago, the American imperialism's "Associated Press" reported from the Korean battlefield: when the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army "swarmed" to attack the American imperialist aggressors, they were not afraid of the strafing of planes and the attacks of rocket launchers. This is a "stupid" thing that "Americans cannot understand." However, in the future, these American imperialist robbers will understand that it is not the Chinese and Korean people who are stupid, but themselves. What they can never understand is the soul and power of a person growing up in a new society. This is the real person praised in the film "Steel Will" adapted from Boris Polevoi's novel.

    歌颂新人的典型
    —《钢铁意志》观后感
    从苏联作家鲍利斯·波列伏依的记实小说《真正的人》编成的电影《钢铁意志》，正如苏联其他许多文艺作品和戏剧电影一样，是一部歌颂新人的典型的作品。
    当我们提到新人的典型的时候，往往还有人不容易了解它的全部的意义。
    其实，他们就是经过无数次的不屈不挠的斗争，在列宁、斯大林的真理的长期教育下，成长为具有人类的崇高的理想和无比坚强的意志的人。
    一九四二年三月，苏联空军上尉，驱逐机的驾驶员阿列克赛·密里席叶夫在空战中被德寇击落在一个为德寇所占领的森林里。他拖着因受伤而溃烂了的两脚，在野兽和德寇横行的冰天雪地的森林里爬行了十八天，终于遇到了在森林里打击德寇的苏联游击队，将他救出。后来在医院里医生把他的两脚锯去，安上一双假脚。“幸福的人们！飞着、打仗，我现在再也飞不起来了。”当阿列克赛躺在医院的病床上想着这样一件似乎已经是不能挽回的事情，他是如何的悲伤，如何的痛苦呵。然而就是这种痛苦，也没有挫折这一位英雄的理想和他的坚强的意志，因为正如那一位令人敬爱的团政委伏罗比约夫和阿列克赛自己所说的，他是一个苏联人。
    是的，一个苏联人，一个在人间最理想的社会制度下长成的人。列宁、斯大林的真理把他们抚育长大，成为世界上最完美的人。他们对他们的国家，对他们的理想，怀着最深的热爱。于是他们就以无比坚强的意志完成了新英雄主义和爱国主义的事业。于是我们看见带着一双假脚的阿列克赛又跳起舞来，而且，终于他又飞起来了，在祖国的苍空上，追击着敢于侵犯他们的敌人，……。
    在今天，这样的新人的典型，新的英雄，不仅在苏联，而且在马克思、列宁、斯大林的真理所照耀着的地方，也正在生长了。在中国，在马、列主义及毛泽东思想的抚育下，我们已经亲眼看见了开始成长的这样的新人。在反抗美帝国主义的新英雄主义和爱国主义的鼓舞下，我们将要看见更多的新的英雄和典型的成长。因此，对我们来说，如像阿列克赛，密里席叶夫这样的新人，是应该能够了解而且能够作为我们的典型的。对于阿列克赛这样的人永远不能了解的，只有那些从人类中蜕化了的人，那些已经不能称作人的人；已经被人类所埋葬了的希特勒、墨索里尼、戈林……和将要被人类所埋葬的杜鲁门、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟……。
    《真正的人》这一部小说的作者波列伏依，当他写完了这一部光辉的作品，在小说的“尾声”里叙述他为什么要写这一部作品的时候，给我们记录了一段纽伦堡国际军事法庭审判戈林时他亲自听见戈林所说的口供：
    “‘你是否承认，你们不顾信义地袭击苏联，它的后果使德国沦于毁灭，这是犯了最大的罪行呢？’苏联控诉人罗曼·鲁靳科向戈林说。
    “‘这不是罪行，这是宿命的错误，’戈林阴郁地垂下眼睛，低声答复。‘我只能承认，我们的举动太轻率了，因为在战争中弄明白，有许多事情我们不知道，……主要的，我们不知道，也不了解苏联人。他们以前是一个谜，至今仍旧是一个谜。……’”然后，波列伏依补充说：“他们这般高唱德意志是‘上帝的种族’的可悯的‘理论’的发明者，那里能了解一个在社会主义国家里生长的人的灵魂和威力呢！”
    现在，美帝国主义正在亚洲重演着德国法西斯一直到死还弄不明白的“宿命的错误”。在朝鲜战场上，他们同样不了解中国人和朝鲜人。前一个时候，美帝国主义的“美联社”从朝鲜战场发出的电讯里说：中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军“蜂拥而来”向美帝国主义的侵略者进攻时，居然不怕飞机的扫射和火箭炮的攻击，这是“美国人所不能了解的”“愚蠢”的事。但是，在将来，这些美帝国主义的强盗们将会了解，愚蠢的不是中国和朝鲜的人民，而是他们自己。他们永远不能了解的是一种生长在一个新的社会的人的灵魂和威力。这就是鲍利斯·波列伏依的小说拍成的电影《钢铁意志》所歌颂的真正的人。
