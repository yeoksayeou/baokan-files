Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: (TASS reports) German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl's proposal in a letter to West German Bonn government Premier Adenauer to establish an All-German Constituent Assembly and oppose remilitarization has received increasing enthusiastic support from all levels of people throughout Germany.

The Free German Youth League, representing all German youth, and the German Democratic Women's Federation, representing all German women, telegraphed Adenauer, urging him to accept Premier Grotewohl's proposal. The Central Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation wrote to the leadership of the West German Trade Union Federation, asking them to support Grotewohl's proposal. The meeting of student representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, held in Leipzig, passed a resolution warmly welcoming Grotewohl's proposal.

Seven hundred miners' representatives from the Ruhr region, after meeting in Dortmund, telegraphed Premier Grotewohl, welcoming his proposal to hold negotiations on the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly, and guaranteed that they would do everything possible to oppose West German remilitarization and the production of munitions in the Ruhr. The Hamburg German Shipyard Union, the Stuttgart Tram Workers' Union, and farmers attending the two All-German Agriculture and Forestry Congresses held in Stuttgart and Kiel, unanimously demanded that the Bonn government accept Premier Grotewohl's proposal.

More than 3,000 mothers and wives of workers in the Hamburg port and shipbuilding docks passed a resolution supporting Grotewohl's proposal and opposing West German remilitarization. They pointed out that 92 percent of Hamburg dockworkers and 85 percent of Hamburg port workers oppose remilitarization. Dr. Schul, a former prisoner of war in Kiel in the British occupation zone, said, "We returning prisoners of war are all opposed to remilitarization because we want our children to live peacefully in cities and villages without the danger of being bombed." A resident of the Brekenau district, Kielhardan, wrote, "I believe that East and West Germany must reach an agreement to save the whole of Germany from the horrors of a new war. Among the people I know, no one opposes such an agreement."

Youths at the Remkind local steel mill have launched a signature campaign against remilitarization. In many cities in West Germany, the movement to support the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly and oppose militarization has developed to such an extent that audiences often pass resolutions supporting Premier Grotewohl's proposal after film screenings.

Even some bourgeois newspapers in West Germany support Premier Grotewohl's proposal. The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," close to leading figures in West German industry, demanded that the Bonn government agree to the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly; the "Stuttgarter Zeitung" published a special article on December 6th, warning the Bonn government that "refusing to negotiate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic will cause deep anger."

    鲁尔工人要求谈判成立全德立宪议会
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥写信给西德波恩政府总理阿登纳提出成立全德立宪议会和反对重新军事化的建议已受到全德各阶层人民越来越多的热烈支持。
    自由德国青年联盟代表全德青年、德国民主妇女联合会代表全德妇女致电阿登纳，敦促他接受格罗提渥总理的建议。自由德国工会联合会中央委员会致函西德工会联合会领导机构，要求他们支持格罗提渥建议。在来比锡举行的德意志民主共和国和德国西部学生代表会议，通过决议，热烈欢迎格罗提渥建议。
    鲁尔区七百名矿工代表在多特蒙德开会后致电格罗提渥总理，欢迎他所提出的就成立全德立宪议会举行谈判的建议，并保证将竭尽全力反对西德重新军事化和反对鲁尔生产军火。汉堡德意志造船厂工会、斯图加特电车工人工会，出席在斯图加特和基尔举行的两次全德农林业代表大会的农民们，一致要求波恩政府接受格罗提渥总理的建议。
    汉堡港口和造船码头三千多工人们的母亲和妻子通过决议，拥护格罗提渥建议，反对西德重新军事化。她们指出：百分之九十二的汉堡码头工人和百分之八十五的汉堡港口工人都反对重新军事化。英占区基尔市的前战俘舒尔博士说：“我们回家的战俘们都反对重新军事化，因为我们要我们的孩子没有被轰炸的危险而能在各城市和乡村中安宁地生活。”布累肯瑙区一个居民基尔哈丹写道：“我相信东德和西德一定要达成协议，以便把整个德国从新战争的恐怖中救出来。在我所认识的人中，没有一个人反对这种协议。”
    雷姆金德地方炼钢厂的青年已展开了征集反对重新军事化的签名运动。在西德许多的城市中，拥护成立全德立宪议会、反对军事化的运动已发展到这样的规模：常常在电影放映后，观众们便通过关于拥护格罗提渥总理建议的决议。
    甚至西德某些资产阶级的报纸也赞成格罗提渥总理的建议。接近西德主要实业界人士的“法兰克福报”要求波恩政府同意成立全德立宪议会；“斯图加特日报”十二月六日发表专文警告波恩政府称：“拒绝与德意志民主共和国代表谈判将引起深切的愤怒。”
