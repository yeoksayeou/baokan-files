Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: TASS, Moscow, December 4th: The newspaper *Pravda* recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, Chechikinna, entitled "Defending Peace," which stated: In Rome, in recent days, agitated and angry crowds have been seen in front of stalls and newsstands. Truman's recent provocative statements at a press conference in Washington and his threats against China and Korea have stirred up a wave of protest and anger among the broad masses of the Italian people. Italian workers, civil servants, and businessmen—people from all walks of life—are responding to Truman's threats by intensifying the struggle to defend peace. In northern Italy, short-term strikes have been held in many of the larger enterprises. News of large-scale worker unrest has come from the Trafelelli factories, the Alfa Romeo car factory, and other enterprises. Many mass rallies have been held by local peace committees, at which workers have demanded an end to the aggressive policies of the American ruling circles and expressed their firm and unwavering will to fight for peace.

    The Italian people are extremely indignant at the slavish behavior of Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, who willingly assists Wall Street in indulging its aggressive desires, even to the point of violating the interests of his own country, obsequiously shouting: "Truman's speech and intentions are the only way to save peace." The wave of protests and strikes in enterprises has swept across the entire Italy. This fully proves that the Italian people will never accept the role of cannon fodder that American imperialism and the traitorous ministers of the Gasperi government are trying to assign to them. The Italian people have a powerful weapon in their hands, and that is unity. This weapon has become even more powerful and sharper since the historically significant World Peace Congress in Warsaw. Nothing in the world is more powerful than the people's struggle for peace. The resolutions of the Warsaw World Peace Congress have helped many Italian people to better understand and recognize the strength of the mass movement of peace fighters.

    Inspired by the Warsaw resolutions, tens of thousands of Italian working people continue to participate in the movement to defend peace. The realization of these resolutions is a guarantee that the forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war and aggression.

    意全国掀起罢工浪潮
    抗议杜鲁门狂妄声明
    许多群众大会要求制止美国侵略
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：真理报顷发表其驻罗马记者契奇金纳以《保卫和平》为题的通讯称：在罗马，近几天来，在货摊和报摊前面都可以看到激动愤怒的人群。杜鲁门最近在华盛顿的记者招待会上发表的挑衅性的声明和他对于中国和朝鲜的恫吓，已经在意大利的广大人民群众中激起了抗议与愤怒的浪潮。意大利的工人、公务员和商人——所有各阶层的劳动人民，都在以加紧保卫和平的斗争来答复杜鲁门的恫吓。在意大利北部，许多比较大的企业中，都举行了短期罢工。从意大利特拉费勒利各厂里、从阿尔法——罗米欧汽车工厂里和其他各企业里，都传来了发生巨大的工人骚动的消息。各地方保卫和平委员会举行了许多群众大会，工人们在会上要求制止美国统治集团的侵略政策，并且表示了他们为保卫和平而斗争的坚定不移的意志。
    意大利人民对于意大利外长史佛卓的奴才行为极表愤慨，因为史佛卓心甘情愿地帮助华尔街放纵它的侵略欲望，以至违反着他本国的利益，奴颜卑膝地高叫：“杜鲁门的讲演和意图是挽救和平的唯一办法。”各企业中的抗议和罢工浪潮已经席卷了整个意大利。这就充分证明：意大利人民决不接受美帝国主义和加斯贝利政府的卖国部长们所企图指派给他们的充当炮灰的角色。意大利的人民大众的手里有一个有力的武器，这就是团结。这个武器自从华沙的有历史意义的世界保卫和平大会以来，已经变得更加有力更加锐利了。世界上再没有什么东西比人民争取和平的斗争更加强大有力的了。华沙世界保卫和平大会的决议，帮助许多意大利人民更加了解与认识到和平战士的群众运动的力量。
    在华沙决议的鼓舞下，继续不断地又有成千成万的意大利劳动人民参加保卫和平的运动。这种决议的实现乃是和平力量必将战胜战争和侵略力量的保证。
