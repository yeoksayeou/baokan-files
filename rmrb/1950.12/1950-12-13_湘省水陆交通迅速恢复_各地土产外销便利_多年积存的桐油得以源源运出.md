    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Hunan Province's shipping and highway transportation, which had been severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandits, has rapidly recovered, greatly facilitating the external sales of local products and the supply of industrial goods. As of now, more than 3,200 kilometers of the province's 3,800+ kilometers of highways are open to traffic. Regular ships sail from Changsha to Changde, Jinshi, Yiyang, Yueyang, Xiangtan, and other places; about 70,000 sailboats regularly operate on inland rivers and lakes. The efficiency of transportation is also gradually improving. For example, the empty-running rate of highway vehicles has dropped from 20 percent in July to 15 percent in September. The rapid recovery of shipping and highway transportation has greatly facilitated the province's external sales of local products and the large-scale import of essential industrial goods. In September, local products and industrial goods accounted for the major portion of the province's more than 1.9 million ton-kilometers of highway freight. Western Hunan is the province's main producing area of tung oil and gallnuts. Before liberation, due to inconvenient transportation, local products were unsalable, causing up to 40 percent of the tung tree forests to become barren. Since liberation, as of now, thanks to the restoration of transportation, the gradual suppression of bandits, and the vigorous purchasing and marketing by state-owned trading companies, the six to seven years' worth of accumulated tung oil in the area has been shipped out in a steady stream. The enthusiasm of farmers in the area for planting tung trees has greatly increased, and the tung oil industry in Yuanling County, a tung oil concentration center, has tripled compared to the time of liberation. Other local products in southern and eastern Hunan have also been sold externally in a timely manner. To further improve the province's transportation conditions, the relevant departments of the province are planning to open highways in agricultural and mineral producing areas in central Hunan and other places, and have decided to take advantage of Hunan's many rivers and vigorously organize civilian sailboat transportation.

    湘省水陆交通迅速恢复
    各地土产外销便利         
    多年积存的桐油得以源源运出
    【新华社讯】曾遭到国民党匪帮严重破坏的湖南省航运、公路交通已迅速恢复，土产外销与工业品的供应大为便利。截至目前为止，全省三千八百多公里的公路中，已有三千二百多公里通车。由长沙至常德、津市、益阳、岳阳、湘潭等地，均有定期轮船航行；内地河、湖约有七万只帆船经常行驶。交通运输效率亦逐渐提高。如公路车辆的空驶率由七月份的百分之二十，降至九月份的百分之十五。航运、公路交通的迅速恢复，大大便利了该省的土产外销和工业必需品的大量运入。九月份全省公路一百九十多万延吨公里的货运中，土产品和工业品占主要部分。湘西为该省桐油、五棓子的主要产地，解放前因交通不便，土产滞销，曾使桐林荒芜达百分之四十。解放后截至目前，由于交通恢复、土匪渐次肃清和国营贸易公司的大力购销，该区积存六、七年的桐油得以源源运出。该区农民植桐情绪已大为提高，桐油集中地沅陵县城的桐油业，已较解放时增加三倍。其余如湘南、湘东地区的土产，也因此得以及时外运销售。为进一步改善全省交通运输条件，该省有关部门正计划开辟湘中等地农、矿产区的公路，并决定利用湖南河道多的特点，大力组织民帆船运输。
