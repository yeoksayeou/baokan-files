To support our people's volunteer action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the National Beijing Library has specially collected various materials and drawn more than twenty statistical charts to systematically form the "The Truth About American Imperialism" exhibition. The main purpose is to illustrate that American imperialism is a corrupt and dying imperialist country, a "paper tiger" that appears strong but is weak inside. It has not only always been the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, but also the public enemy of world peace-loving people. It is now open, and the exhibition period is twenty days. Relevant books and periodicals are also provided during the exhibition period for reference and research.

    北京图书馆举办
    “美帝真相”展览
    国立北京图书馆为支援我人民抗美援朝的志愿行动，特搜集了各种资料并绘制了二十余幅统计图表，有系统的组成“美帝真相”展览。主要目的在说明美帝是一个腐朽的垂死的帝国主义国家，是一只外强中干的“纸老虎”，不但一向是中国人民的死敌，并且是世界和平人民的公敌。现已开幕，展览期为二十日。在展览期内并提出有关书刊，以供参考研究。
