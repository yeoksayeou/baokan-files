(New China News Agency, Eighth Dispatch) According to TASS dispatches: The West Berlin authorities, disregarding the Berlin people's protests and the Berlin Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany's proposal to hold unified Berlin elections, held a separate so-called "city council" "election" on December 3rd, deepening the division of Berlin. The purpose of the "election" was to accelerate war preparations and further transform West Berlin into a springboard for American military aggression. The eight reactionary parties approved to participate in the "election," including the Schumacher Social Democratic Party, which pretends to oppose immediate military buildup, all support the American policy of remilitarizing West Germany and West Berlin.

More than 250,000 residents of West Berlin, despite the West Berlin authorities' terror and persecution, expressed their opposition to this "election" in various ways. According to preliminary statistics: more than 160,000 peace advocates in West Berlin refused to participate in this "election" farce; 50,000 voters who were forced to participate in "voting" destroyed their ballots; in addition, the West Berlin authorities also crossed more than 50,000 peace advocates off the "voter" lists. On the eve of the "election," many residents received anonymous threatening letters.

During the "election," lackeys and secret agents of the eight reactionary parties were all over the polling places, carrying lists of so-called "unreliable elements," openly monitoring voters filling out ballots, and even intercepting people going to vote on the road, making threats. Even the West German bourgeois newspaper *Monday Morning News* reported that in the polling station at 54 Ringstrasse, a mass representative participating in the vote counting was arrested for pointing out the election committee's cheating. On December 4th alone, the military court of Moabit in West Berlin tried thirty-two peace fighters who opposed this divisive "election."

    柏林西区举行伪选大批居民拒绝参加
    【新华社八日讯】综合塔斯社消息：柏林西区当局，不顾柏林人民的抗议与民主德国全国阵线柏林委员会关于举行柏林统一选举的建议，于十二月三日举行了加深柏林的分裂的所谓“市议会”的单独“选举”，“选举”的目的是加速战争准备，进一步变西柏林为美国的军事侵略跳板。获准参加“选举”的八个反动政党，包括伪装反对立即建军的舒马赫社会民主党在内，都拥护美国使西德和柏林西区重新军国主义化的政策。
    柏林西区二十五万以上的居民，不顾柏林西区当局的恐怖迫害，用各种方式表示反对这次“选举”。据初步统计：柏林西区有十六万以上的和平拥护者拒绝参加这次“选举”的把戏；被迫参加“投票”的五万选民毁坏了选票；此外，柏林西区当局还把五万名以上的和平拥护者从“选民”名单上勾消。在“选举”前夕许多居民收到了匿名的恐吓信。
    在举行“选举”时，八个反动党派的狗腿和暗探，满布各选区，随身带着所谓“不可靠分子”的名单，公然监视选民填写选票，甚至在路上拦截去投票的人，进行威胁。连西德资产阶级的《星期一晨报》也报道：在岭格街五十四号投票站里，一位参加监票的群众代表因为指出了选举委员会的作弊情形而被捕。柏林西区摩阿比特的军事法庭在十二月四日一天就审讯了三十二名反对这次分裂“选举”的和平斗士。
