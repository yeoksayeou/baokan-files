Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The All-China Students' Federation issued a letter to students across the country, calling on them to join military cadre schools to strengthen national defense. The full text is as follows:

Fellow Students Across the Country:

The Central People's Government's Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council have issued a decision calling on students across the country to enthusiastically join the Air Force, Navy, and various special forces military cadre schools to learn military knowledge and accelerate national defense construction. The All-China Students' Federation warmly supports this decision and calls on students across the country to respond to the solemn call of the motherland and undertake this glorious task!

Today, our Chinese people's most dangerous enemy—the American imperialist aggressors—has occupied our territory of Taiwan; constantly attacks us from the air and sea; and is carrying out blatant aggression against our country, attempting to destroy the free and happy life we have won through years of arduous struggle, and force us to live through dark and miserable days again. Faced with this situation, students in various regions have actively participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, and have issued angry calls: "We can no longer tolerate it, we must resolutely repel the crazy attacks of American imperialism!"

Students, in the history of the Chinese student movement over the past thirty years, countless pioneers have bravely participated in the Chinese people's armed struggle against internal and external reactionaries. The students who participated in the "December 9th" Movement bravely participated in the establishment of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The students who participated in the "December 1st" Movement joined the People's Guerrilla Force in the Southwest during the People's Liberation War. Many of them have now become excellent commanders and political workers in the People's Liberation Army, and they have all set a good example for us. Past facts tell us: When the nation is subjected to foreign aggression and the country is in need, Chinese educated youth dare to resolutely combine with the people's armed forces.

Now, the motherland needs to strengthen its national defense forces and needs a large number of young people with a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge to participate in modern national defense construction, and has issued a call to all of us students; for us, this is exactly the time to express our infinite loyalty to the motherland with a practical action! It is precisely the time for us to specifically promote the high patriotism and heroic struggle tradition of our Chinese student movement! There is no doubt that thousands upon thousands of students joining aviation schools, naval schools, and various special forces cadre schools to study will certainly play a significant role in rapidly developing and strengthening our motherland's national defense forces!

Our students across the country, although studying in different regions, different towns and villages, different public or private schools, are all children of the Chinese nation, all deeply nurtured and educated by the people and the motherland, and all eagerly hope for the prosperity and progress of our country and a brighter future for ourselves. Now, when imperialist aggressors are attempting to shatter all our beautiful hopes, and the motherland needs to accelerate the consolidation of modern national defense construction, we believe that Chinese students with a glorious patriotic tradition will definitely unite as one, join hands and rise up, and enthusiastically respond to the call of the motherland! We believe that Chinese students can not only respond to the call of the country in peaceful construction, study hard, and actively participate in construction work, but also contribute our strength and bravely participate in the cause of national defense construction when the country needs it. We believe that thousands upon thousands of outstanding pilots, naval officers and soldiers, mechanized corps commanders, tank soldiers, and various outstanding builders in the cause of national defense construction will emerge from our generation of patriotic youth.

The people of the whole country are placing deep expectations on us, and Chairman Mao's victorious banner is guiding us forward. Students, let us bravely advance!

    全国学联告同学书
    【新华社一日讯】中华全国学生联合会为号召全国同学参加军事干部学校加强国防建设告同学书，全文如下：全国同学们：
    中央人民政府中国人民革命军事委员会及政务院已发布决定，号召全国同学踊跃参加空军、海军及各特种兵军事干部学校，学习军事知识，加速国防建设。中华全国学生联合会热烈拥护这个决定，并号召全国同学响应祖国的庄严的号召，承担这个光荣的任务！
    今天，我们中国人民最危险的敌人——美帝国主义侵略者，已侵占了我国的领土台湾；不断从空中从海上袭击我们；对我国进行着明目张胆的侵略，企图破坏我们艰苦斗争多年争取得来的自由幸福生活，迫使我们再过黑暗苦难的日子。面对这种情况，各地同学已积极参加抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动，纷纷发出愤怒的呼喊：“我们再也不能容忍了，我们要坚决打退美帝国主义的疯狂进攻！”
    同学们，三十年来，在中国学生运动史上有过无数先驱者英勇地参加了中国人民反对内外反动派的武装斗争。参加“一二·九”运动的同学们在抗日战争时期英勇地参加建立敌后抗日游击战争，参加“一二·一”运动的同学们在人民解放战争时期参加了西南的人民游击队。他们中的很多人今天已经成为人民解放军的优秀的指挥员和政治工作人员，他们都曾给我们作了很好的榜样。过去的事实告诉我们：在民族受到外来侵略和国家需要的时候，中国的知识青年是敢于坚决地和人民武装相结合的。
    现在，祖国需要加强国防力量，需要大批有一定文化科学知识水平的青年参加现代化的国防建设，并已向我们全体同学发出号召；对于我们，这正是以一个实际行动表示我们对祖国的无限忠诚的时候！正是我们具体地发扬我们中国学生运动高度爱国主义和英勇斗争传统的时候！毫无疑问，千千万万同学加入航空学校、海军学校，以及各种特种兵干部学校学习，对于迅速发展和壮大我们祖国的国防力量，是一定能起重大作用的！
    我们全国同学，虽在不同地区、不同城镇乡村、不同的公立或私立学校中学习，但我们同样都是中华民族的儿女，同样都是深受人民祖国的培养教育，同样都是热切地期望我们国家的繁荣进步和我们自己更光明的未来。现在正当帝国主义侵略者企图粉碎我们的一切美好希望，祖国正需要加速巩固近代化国防建设的时候，我们相信：具有光荣爱国传统的中国学生，一定会齐心合力，携手奋起，踊跃响应祖国的号召！我们相信：我们中国学生既能够在和平建设中，响应国家号召，努力学习，积极参加建设工作，也一定能在国家需要的时候，贡献出我们的力量，勇敢地参加国防建设事业。我们相信：从我们这一代的爱国青年当中一定会涌现出千千万万优秀的飞行员、人民海军和机械化兵团的指战员、坦克手以及国防建设事业中的各种优秀建设者。
    全国人民对我们正寄予深切的期望，毛主席胜利的旗帜在前面引导着我们。同学们，让我们奋勇前进吧！
