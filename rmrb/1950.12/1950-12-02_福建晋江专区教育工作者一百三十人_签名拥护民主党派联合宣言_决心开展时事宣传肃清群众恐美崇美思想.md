    One Hundred and Thirty Educators from the Jinjiang Special District of Fujian
    Sign in Support of the Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties
    Determined to Carry Out Current Affairs Propaganda to Eliminate the Masses' Fear of and Worship of the United States.
    [Our Newspaper News] Educators in the Jinjiang Special District of Fujian Province have signed and issued a statement supporting the joint declaration of the democratic parties, determined to carry out current affairs propaganda to eliminate the masses' fear of, worship of, and pro-American sentiments, and to struggle for resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home and defending the country. The statement stated: Our Quanzhou (i.e., Jinjiang) area is one of the earliest areas invaded by imperialism, and now it is the front line for liberating Jinmen and Taiwan. American imperialism is also colluding with the Kuomintang remnant bandits, directing special agents and bandits to carry out various sabotage activities in this area. Therefore, the broad masses of people are extremely resentful of American imperialism. However, many people still harbor fear of, worship of, and pro-American sentiments. We educators in the Quanzhou area express our firm support for the solemn joint declaration of the democratic parties. In addition to carrying out current affairs study, we have decided to strengthen the implementation of political and ideological education in various subjects, launch current affairs propaganda campaigns, eliminate fear of, worship of, and pro-American sentiments, cultivate students' and the broad masses of people's spirit of internationalism and new patriotism, strengthen our determination to fight and our belief in victory, shatter the bandits' rumors, stop the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism, and strive to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country. We also hope that educators in various regions will unite, support, and participate in the great movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard the home, and defend the country!
    Those who participated in the signing included Wang Yiting, director of the Fujian Provincial Education Union Jinjiang Special District Office, and 130 principals, deans, and political instructors from more than 60 schools, including Fujian Provincial Jinzhong, County Jinzhong, Quanzhou Middle School, and Peiyuan Middle School.
