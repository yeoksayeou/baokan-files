Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th (TASS dispatch): The new color film "Liberated China" has been screened in the Soviet Union with great success. Today, Moscow newspapers published film reviews of this epic.

	Pravda published a special article pointing out: The film "Liberated China" is a true and moving cinematic document depicting the political and socio-economic changes implemented by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader, Mao Zedong. The scenes that praise the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, and those that explain how the Chinese Communist Party, which led this struggle, grew stronger year by year, are unforgettable. The film review further writes: The historically significant parts of the film, although using an understated style, are still extremely moving. The producers skillfully presented the most important links in the continuous events, vividly showing the important stages of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The theme of this film is extremely broad and the interweaving is very diverse, but the harmony and unity of the structure are still very significant. The educational value of this film is also very great. It helps people to understand more deeply and comprehensively the role China has played in history, and it shows the greatness and competence of those talented people who have come to the fore and are engaged in building a new life with unprecedented strength. The people's strong desire for knowledge is deeply displayed. Like Soviet youth, Chinese young men and women have enjoyed the right to education. China is thousands of kilometers away from Moscow. But the wise Lenin's teaching—study, study, and study again—is today active in the hearts of the Chinese working people. The film review emphasizes: The final few scenes—the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the grand celebration on Tiananmen Square in Beijing on October 1, 1949—are generally regarded as a solemn and magnificent song of victory. The rich diversity of colors completely conveys that joy and happiness.

	The film review concludes: After years of arduous struggle, the Chinese people have won the right to engage in peaceful and creative labor. They have experienced the hardships of war, and they know how unspeakable suffering war brings. They have made a great contribution to the struggle to defend peace, and they know that they are not alone; standing with them are their faithful friends—the great Soviet people.

	Izvestia praised the film, created through the close cooperation of outstanding filmmakers from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as a masterpiece of cinematic art. The authors of this film have great artistic appreciation and tirelessly adhere to living truth, using those brilliant materials to show the new life of liberated China. Precisely for that reason, many scenes from this film will remain in people's memories for a long time. The entire film makes a great impression. The film, supervised by the capable Soviet film director Gerasimov, demonstrates the great creativity of the Chinese people and their indomitable will for labor and creation. Soviet and Chinese filmmakers should receive due praise; through their joint efforts, they have vividly reproduced pictures of the new Chinese landscape and mass scenes in bright colors. The film "Liberated China" is also a valuable contribution to the great cause of peace and the cause of human liberation.
