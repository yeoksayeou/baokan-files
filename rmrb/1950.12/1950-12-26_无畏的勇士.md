    Fearless Warrior
    (By our reporter Tian Liu)
    On the Korean battlefield, countless brave heroes have emerged. Wang Pengxu is one of them.
    On the eastern front, under the joint attack of our volunteer forces and the Korean People's Army, the enemy's "final offensive to end the Korean War" turned into a decisive total collapse. The enemy abandoned all their supplies, equipment, nude women's pictures, and their corpses on the shores of Changjin Lake, desperately fleeing south.
    Ahead, there was no end in sight, and behind, there was no end in sight. Countless soldiers of the Korean People's Army were advancing, countless soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were advancing. "Catch the enemy, don't let them escape!" People encouraged each other with such slogans. Thus, countless tanks, countless artillery pieces, countless stretchers, and medical teams surged forward even more rapidly. The trucks driven by Wang Pengxu and others, fully loaded with ammunition, provisions, and cold-weather gear, were stopped in a secret location, awaiting orders.
    A drizzle began to fall, turning into small, rice-like pellets of ice at dusk, and then into goose-feather snow at night. Some drivers were curled up under the trucks, others were hiding in mountain caves beside the trucks. The cold wind seemed to pass through their backs, and their hands and feet were numb with cold. Ice pellets hung on their eyelashes and beards. But their spirits were very high.
    The next morning, the cold slowly dissipated, and everyone felt warmer—suddenly, a fierce gust of cold wind blew from the mountains, making everyone shiver. Mixed with the howling of the wind, there was a strange, faint, rustling sound. The sentry immediately sent out a signal, and everyone vigilantly grabbed their guns and ran to their pre-selected positions, staring intently, focusing all their attention on monitoring the movements in the mountains.
    When the strange sound in the mountains rose again, the second squad leader fired two shots with his rifle, followed by a burst of rapid, panicked footsteps fleeing into the depths of the forest. At this time, everyone swarmed up, rushing straight into the forest, searching everywhere. The enemy had already slipped away.
    No one said it openly, but everyone certainly believed that this was the work of American spies. The American invaders had transported spies to North Korea by plane in batches. These spies hid in high mountains and deep valleys, using radios and signals to report situations to their masters, firing signal flares, and using vile methods of assassination and sniping to disrupt the rear of the People's Army. Not long ago, the drivers had personally seen enemy planes drop hundreds of such spies into these mountain forests.
    Everyone returned to their vehicles in silence, re-examining whether the hidden parts of the vehicles were suitable, and some re-camouflaged their vehicles. Because they clearly knew that the spies had just been spying here, especially because they had not caught the spies, everyone was on guard against possible enemy attacks.
    Just as the sun was setting, suddenly, a piercing, strange sound pierced the quiet dusk.
    "Airplane!" Wang Pengxu heard it first. Before he finished speaking, two enemy planes were already overhead, neither circling nor scouting, but diving straight down. Whoosh... a burst of strafing fire, and they flew past. Just as everyone had taken cover, the enemy planes turned around and bombed and strafed repeatedly as many as six times, but they didn't hit a single person or vehicle. Only the last bomb hit a vehicle right next to the cliff, and it caught fire.
    "Comrades, hurry up and rescue the vehicle..." Comrade Wang Pengxu, hiding by the small river next to the vehicle, forgot about the enemy planes still circling overhead, shouting as he rushed towards the burning vehicle—the vehicle was burning, and the bullets on it began to explode, thick smoke rising straight into the trees on the mountaintop. "Damn it!" Old Wang cursed: "Five vehicles are so close together." The burning vehicle was parked one meter to the left of another, and two meters to the right of another, and four meters to the side and rear of yet another. Although the vehicle in front was farther away, it blocked the way!
    The flames felt like they were burning on his body, the bullets seemed to be exploding in his chest. Anxiousness made Old Wang forget everything. He rushed towards the burning vehicle several times, but was pushed back by the flames each time. "As long as the burning vehicle is driven away, the four nearby vehicles can be saved," Old Wang thought. With his head in his arms, he burrowed into the fire again. But the vehicle was completely burned and could not be moved. The three nearby vehicles could not move either because the fourth vehicle was blocking the way! In a moment of crisis, correct and courageous action is the highest wisdom. Old Wang immediately ran to the fourth vehicle that was blocking the way, quickly drove it out, and cleared the way for the three vehicles behind. At this time, Zhao Shiyu, Yin Gui, and other driver comrades had heard the noise and arrived. Zhao Shiyu risked danger to drive out the vehicle one meter away from the burning vehicle, which had been baked red-hot by the flames and was covered in bullet marks. Comrade Yin Gui also quickly drove the vehicle four meters away from the danger zone.
    When Wang Pengxu drove out the first vehicle and ran back again, it was even more difficult to rescue the last remaining vehicle. The fire was burning even more fiercely, the bullets were flying everywhere, and it was so close to the burning vehicle—only two meters away! Old Wang crawled forward, trying to climb to the door and open it quickly to drive out. But the door was so hot that it burned his hand and he couldn't open it. The fuel tank was already making sizzling sounds. The experienced Wang Pengxu knew that this vehicle would soon catch fire due to the high heat, and then the vehicle full of shells...—the consequences would be unimaginable. Time did not allow for any hesitation. At this extremely critical moment, he remembered that this was a struggle in which he should spare no effort to win. If the Americans won, he would return to the dark days.
    Originally, at the age of eighteen, he was dragged out of school by the Japanese invaders and drafted into the puppet army. Then he was thrown into a motor vehicle training school, and then whipped to drive cars for the enemy... At that time, how he yearned for the motherland, but where was the motherland? Like a thunderclap, the Japanese surrendered, and the Northeast was liberated. Old Wang returned to his hometown with unusual excitement, returning to Shenyang, where he saw his parents, who were nearly seventy years old, and his young wife. The Kuomintang's sinful rule made it impossible for him to live. Shenyang was liberated, the Communist Party came, and Old Wang drove every day, and his life gradually stabilized. Then came the land reform, and he was also given fifteen acres of good land. Together with his own six acres of land, he lived a better life. Who would have thought that American imperialism would invade from Korea again, and repeatedly cross the border to bomb Andong and other places. Seeing that the good days were in danger of being destroyed by American imperialism again, he settled his family, bid farewell to his parents, and joined the Volunteer Army, serving as the repair squad leader of this Volunteer Motor Transport Company, running around the Korean mountains with the cars all day long. Wherever the car broke down, he would repair it there, never delaying transportation. The letter he received from his wife yesterday told him that the whole family was doing well, that the children had all made new cotton clothes this year, and that the whole village cared for them everywhere. She also said, "I am picking good grain to prepare for the public grain," and finally, she hoped that he would "work harder and defeat the American aggressors quickly so that the whole family can reunite."
    The vehicle in front of him was burning more and more fiercely, the bullets were exploding more and more violently, and a vehicle full of shells next to it was in extreme danger. Old Wang grabbed a cotton quilt, ran to the small river, soaked it thoroughly, put it on his head, and plunged into the raging flames and the rain of bullets. Another driver gave him a wet sack. He quickly covered the sizzling fuel tank with the sack, poured a bucket of cold water on the vehicle, opened the door, rushed into the vehicle, and covered the hot engine cover with the protective quilt. He entered the driver's seat, grabbed the steering wheel, wanting to back the vehicle away, away from the burning vehicle, but a high cliff blocked it, making it impossible to reverse; to move forward, he had to rush through the sea of fire. In case a stray bullet fell into the vehicle, the whole vehicle of shells would explode, at that time the vehicle and his own life could perish together. However, Old Wang made up his mind, shouting, "If there is a vehicle, there is me, if there is me, there is a vehicle," he finally put his foot on the accelerator and rushed straight through.
    Because of this outstanding achievement, the front headquarters gave a commendation and awarded him a major meritorious service. All the comrades in the company congratulated him. Old Wang said, "This is nothing, this happened to me, any comrade would do the same if they encountered it." He also said: "We must work harder and defeat the American aggressors quickly so that we can live in peace."

    无畏的勇士
    （本报记者田流）
    朝鲜战场上，出现了无数的勇敢的英雄。王鹏勖就是其中的一个。
    东线的敌人，在我志愿部队与朝鲜人民军联合打击下，“结束朝鲜战争的总攻势”，变成了决定性的总崩溃。敌人把所有辎重、装备、裸体女人像片以及他们的尸体遗弃在长津湖畔，拼命地南逃。
    前看不到头，后望不见尾，无数的朝鲜人民军在前进，无数的中国人民志愿军在前进，“抓住敌人，不要让他跑掉。”迅速前进的人们以这样的口号来互相鼓励着。于是无数的战车、无数的大炮、无数的担架、救护队更迅速地涌向前方。王鹏勖等驾驶着的满装着弹药、给养、防寒物品的汽车，则停止在秘密的场所待命。
    天下起霏霏的细雨来了，黄昏时变成了米粒似的小冰砂，入夜又变成鹅毛大雪。司机有的蜷曲在车下，有的躲在车旁的山洞里，寒风像从背心中穿过，手脚都冻麻木了，冰粒挂在眼睫毛和胡须上。但他们的精神十分旺盛。
    第二天早晨，寒冷慢慢的被驱散了，浑身都有了暖意——骤然，山林中吹来了一阵凛冽的寒风，使每个人都打起寒战。夹杂在寒风呼啸中传来一种异样的、隐约的、嗦嗦移动的声响。警戒哨立时传下暗号，所有的人都警惕地端着枪跑到预先选好的位置上，双目凝视，全神贯注地监视着山林的动静。
    当山林中奇怪的声响再起时，二班长乒乓打了两枪，接着是一阵急骤的慌乱的脚步声向树林深处逃去。这时大家便蜂拥而上，直冲入山林中，四处搜寻。敌人已经溜远了。
    谁都不说穿，但谁都肯定地认为这是美国特务捣蛋。美国侵略者把他的间谍曾成批地用飞机运送到北朝鲜，这些间谍们便利用高山、深谷隐藏起来，用电台、信号向他们的主子报告情况，放信号枪；并用暗杀、狙击的恶毒手段，扰乱人民军的后方。不久前，司机们还亲眼看见过，敌机向这一带山林投下了百多个这样的间谍。
    大家都一言不发的回到自己的车旁，重新检查车子的隐蔽部位是否合适，有的人又重新伪装着自己的车辆。因为他们清楚地知道，特务刚才窥视过这里，特别是因为没有把特务抓住，每个人都在警惕着敌人可能的袭击。
    正当夕阳西下以后，忽然，一种刺耳的怪音，划破安静的黄昏。
    “飞机！”王鹏勖首先听见，话音未落，两架敌机已到顶空，既不盘旋也不侦察，一直俯冲下来，哗……一阵扫射，飞过去了。当大家刚隐蔽好，敌机又扭过头来，轰炸扫射反复达六次之多，但它没有打中一个人、一台车。只有最后一颗炸弹，击中在紧靠山崖的一辆车上，起火了。
    “同志们，赶快来抢救车子啊……”隐蔽在车旁小河边的王鹏勖同志，忘记了仍在头顶盘旋的敌机，呼喊着向起火的汽车扑去——汽车正燃烧，车上的子弹开始爆炸，浓烟直升到山巅的树林中。“该死！”老王咒骂着：“五台汽车距离这样近。”起火的汽车靠左边一公尺远停放着一台，右边二公尺远又是一台，侧后四公尺远还有一台。虽然，前面的一台车距离远些，却恰恰挡住了去路！
    烈火就像在身上燃烧，子弹似在胸膛爆炸，焦急使老王忘掉了一切，几次直扑燃烧着的汽车，但几次都被烈火推回来了。“只要把起火的车开走，就可使附近的四台车得以保全”，老王这样想着，抱着头又钻入火里。但汽车已全部烧毁，无法移动。附近的三台车又因第四台车挡住去路，欲动不能。危急的瞬间，正确而勇敢的行动就是最高的智慧，老王便立时奔向挡住去路的第四台车，迅速开出，给后面的三台车让出了道路。这时赵世玉、印贵和其他司机同志们都已闻声赶到，赵世玉便冒着危险将距起火汽车一公尺的、已被烈火烤得滚烫、遍体弹痕的那台车开出，印贵同志也把距四公尺的那台车迅速地开出危险区。
    当王鹏勖开出第一台车，再跑回来时，剩下的最后一台车就更困难抢救了。火已烧得更烈，子弹乱飞，而且距起火车子这样近——仅仅二公尺啊！老王匍伏着前进，他企图爬到车门边，突然开门飞速开出。但车门已烧得灼手，不能打开，油箱已渍渍作响，经验丰富的王鹏勖知道，这一台车马上就会因高热而起火，那时车上满载的炮弹……——简直将不堪设想。时间不允许任何迟疑，就在这万分危殆的时候，他想起了这是他应当不惜生命来争取胜利的斗争，如果美国人胜利，他又将重新回到黑暗的日子。
    原来，他在十八岁时，就被日寇从学校里拉出来，编入伪军，而后又被投入汽车训练学校，再后被鞭打着给敌人开汽车……当时是多么向往着祖国啊，然而祖国在那里？一声霹雷，日寇投降了，东北解放了。老王怀着异样兴奋的心情回到家乡，回到沈阳，见到了年近七旬的双亲和年青的妻子。国民党的罪恶统治，使他无法生活下去。沈阳解放了，共产党来了，老王天天出车，生活也就逐步安定下来。随后是土地改革，又分到了十五亩好地，连上自己的六亩地，小日子过的更美了。谁想美帝国主义又从朝鲜打进来，还屡次越过国境轰炸安东等地，眼看好日子又有被美帝国主义破坏的危险，于是他安置了家庭，告别了双亲，参加了志愿军，担任了这个志愿汽车运输连的修理班长，成日里跟着汽车奔驰在朝鲜山野间，车在那里坏了，就在那里修理，从没耽误过运输。昨天收到的妻子的信上还告诉他，全家人都很好，孩子们今年都作了新棉衣，告诉他全村人处处关心他们，还说“我正拣好粮食准备交公粮”，最后，希望他“加倍努力工作，快些打垮美国侵略者，好全家团聚。”
    眼前汽车越燃越烈，子弹越炸越凶，旁边的一台满载炮弹的车处在万分危殆中。老王顺手抄起一条棉被，奔往小河，湿透后，顶在头上，钻进熊熊的烈火和乱飞的弹雨中。另一个司机也湿了一条麻袋给了他，他急速将麻袋盖在啧啧发响的油箱上，又向车泼了一桶冷水，打开车门，冲入车内，把护身的棉被盖在灼热的机关盖上。人是进入了司机台，也把住了舵轮，想把车子倒退，离开燃烧着的车子，但万丈高崖顶住了，后退不能；前进就必须从火海中冲过去，万一乱飞的子弹，落入车内，满车的炮弹，就要爆炸，那时汽车和自己的生命都可能同归于尽。但是，老王把心一横，高呼着：“有车子就有我，有我就有车子”，终于开足马力，直冲过去了。
    因为他这一卓越的功绩，前方司令部便给予通报嘉奖，并给他立大功一次。全连的同志都向他祝贺。老王说：“这不算啥，这事是叫我赶上了，同志们不论谁遇上都会这样的。”他还说：“要加倍努力工作，快些打垮美国侵略者，好过太平日子。”
