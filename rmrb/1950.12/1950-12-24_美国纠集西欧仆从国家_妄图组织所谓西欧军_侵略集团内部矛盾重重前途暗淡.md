Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The American imperialism, utterly defeated by the Chinese and Korean people in the East, has recently been frantically piecing together its forces of aggression in the West. From the 18th to the 19th of this month, the United States gathered its vassal states within the North Atlantic aggression bloc for a meeting in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. Under the duress of the United States, the North Atlantic group of nations has announced in a council communique that they have decided to prepare to establish a unified aggression army in Western Europe with "centralized management and command," and have appointed former U.S. Commander of the European Occupation Forces, Eisenhower, as its "Supreme Commander" to be responsible for starting the establishment of this army. At the same time, the meeting also decided to formally allow West German mercenary forces to join this unified aggression army as its backbone. The so-called "Western European Union" countries have also decided to abolish the "Western European Union" or completely incorporate it into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the so-called "Western European Union Army Headquarters" has also decided to be incorporated into the North Atlantic unified aggression army under the command of Eisenhower.

This action by the U.S. imperialism and its vassal states is the most shameless violation of the Potsdam Agreement, the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance, the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and other solemn international agreements prohibiting the re-militarization of Germany, and is a clear demonstration of allying with Hitler elements at the risk of universal condemnation to pursue its aggressive plans.

However, the realization of this aggressive measure by the U.S. imperialism faces insurmountable difficulties.

Even imperialist news agencies do not deny that the Brussels meeting was convened against an "extremely bleak background." On the eve of the meeting, a United Press Washington dispatch admitted that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, who went to Western Europe to promote his plan, was in an extremely difficult position for three reasons. The first is that the United States' "military setbacks in Korea, especially the fact that a large part of the U.S. military is indefinitely tied down in Korea, have delayed the fulfillment of the U.S. promise to send troops to Europe." Second, the Soviet Union's proposals regarding Germany and the notes warning Britain and France not to violate the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties have made Western European governments afraid of popular resistance to the arming of West Germany and afraid of the consequences of listening to American war policies. Third, the extreme confusion shown within the U.S. ruling clique after the failure of the Korean War has made Western European countries hesitant about American policies.

Under these circumstances, although the meeting's communique announced that "unanimous agreement was reached," it was far from the plan that Acheson had originally attempted to force his vassal states to accept at the meeting. Many imperialist news agencies and newspapers have revealed that the North Atlantic unified aggression army, which the United States announced so hastily, actually has little guarantee. The New York Times said that "the decision in Brussels was a difficult decision" and was made "reluctantly." A Reuters reporter gloomily admitted: "The communique issued today emphasizes that the Brussels meeting adopted a decision 'unanimously,' but the unease in Western capitals has not been reduced by this assurance." People in Paris described the Brussels meeting communique as "vague" and believed that: "Although the communique indicates that twelve countries have reached an agreement, it is far from the certainty that was expected. The communique does not mention procedural issues, and Eisenhower does not seem to have a time limit in establishing a unified army. But one thing is clear: the Americans who came to Brussels determined to quickly resolve the European army issue have been persuaded to do it slowly. Because this issue has proven to be more complicated than the United States imagined."

Why is the problem so complicated?

A United Press reporter admitted that the main difficulty for the United States in establishing the North Atlantic army is the extreme lack of troops and manpower. He called the North Atlantic unified aggression army that the United States plans to establish a "paper army" and believed that "according to the observation of the Atlantic countries," the hope of quickly making it a force capable of fighting the Soviet army "is very slim." After meticulously calculating the total strength of the North Atlantic aggression bloc, he had to complain: "If all the existing standing armies of the North Atlantic Treaty countries were completely handed over to Eisenhower tomorrow, the total number would be only about 1.4 million, and most of them have not undergone actual combat training." (United Press, Brussels, December 20th)

The plan to organize a unified aggression army this time shows that the U.S. imperialism is attempting to solve its lack of troops from West Germany. However, a United Press reporter admitted in a dispatch from Frankfurt on the 19th that the U.S. imperialism's desire to make the West German people cannon fodder for it in aggressive wars "will not be easy. Before they can bring the German army to stand with the Western armies, Western planners must overcome Germany's fierce opposition. The basic reasons for this opposition are the nation's frank fear, widespread indifference, and a simple and clear fact: millions of Germans are already tired of war. Even West German Chancellor Adenauer, the number one salesman for the Brussels plan, does not seem to be very willing to accept the goods that the West wants him to peddle."

Another difficulty facing the U.S. imperialism is that Western European governments are afraid of being the first to be destroyed in the American war plan. Taking France as an example, according to a Reuters London dispatch on the 19th: "France's response in recent weeks has been quite lukewarm. In addition to the traditional fear of German military revival, French political figures have indeed been moved by the Soviet warning. During the French National Assembly's discussion of foreign policy last week, right-leaning peasant party leader Badou and Socialist member Meyer both requested that the government proceed cautiously in the face of the Soviet warning and not rashly approve Germany's rearmament." And if a war breaks out, "France will inevitably bear the brunt, which everyone in France dislikes."

Western European governments are also afraid that following the American plan will inevitably lead to an unsolvable economic crisis. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Frankfurt on the 15th: "The French government is already unable to cope when trying to request funds for a small military alliance's military efforts in Indochina, let alone handle a full European defense. Britons who are already heavily taxed are unwilling to give up their happiness and welfare undertakings for defense costs. The same problem exists in the small countries of Europe."

Under these circumstances filled with difficulties, a United Press reporter sadly sighed: "The Atlantic countries have all guaranteed at this week's Atlantic Conference to make continuous efforts in all aspects to carry out this plan. But so far, no country has even begun partial mobilization." (United Press, Brussels, December 20th)

This desolate scene within the North Atlantic group has also greatly troubled their American masters. Acheson said after the meeting: "We have to do the kind of work that I started when I signed the convention. So far, what we have already done is too little and too slow. We still have a very long way to go. In the past, we wasted a lot of time on fruitless things." The factors that caused Acheson's troubles cannot but cast a shadow over the future of Eisenhower, the "Supreme Commander" of the North Atlantic unified aggression army who is about to take office. Eisenhower helplessly admitted: "The work of organizing a European defense (should be read as aggression) army will not be easy, nor will it be rapid."

    美国纠集西欧仆从国家
    妄图组织所谓西欧军
    侵略集团内部矛盾重重前途暗淡
    【新华社二十二日讯】为中朝人民在东方打得一败涂地的美帝国主义，最近又手忙脚乱地在西方拚凑其侵略力量。从本月十八日至十九日，美国纠集其北大西洋侵略集团内各仆从国家，在比利时首都布鲁塞尔举行会议。在美国胁迫下，北大西洋集团各国已在理事会公报中宣布：决定准备在西欧建立一支“集中管理与指挥”的统一侵略军，并任命前美国征欧军总司令艾森豪威尔为其“最高司令官”，以负责着手建立这一支军队。同时，会议亦已决定正式使西德雇佣军参加这支统一侵略军以充当其骨干。所谓“西欧联盟”各国亦决定将“西欧联盟”取消或完全并入北大西洋公约组织之中，所谓“西欧联盟军总司令部”亦已决定编入归艾森豪威尔指挥的北大西洋统一侵略军中。
    美帝国主义及其仆从国家的这一行动，乃是对波茨坦协定、法苏同盟互助条约、英苏合作互助条约、以及其他关于禁止德国重新军事化的庄严国际协定的最无耻的破坏，乃是不惜冒天下之大不韪而与希特勒分子结盟以推行其侵略计划的明证。
    但是，美帝国主义这一侵略措施的实现，有着难于克服的重重困难。
    连帝国主义的通讯社也不否认：布鲁塞尔会议是在“极其阴暗的背景下”召开的。在会议前夕合众社华盛顿电讯承认，到西欧去推行其计划的美国国务卿艾奇逊，由于三个原因而处于极其困难的地位。这就是第一，美国在“朝鲜军事失利，特别是这造成美国一大部分军队无限期地被牵制在朝鲜而使美国派兵赴欧的诺言延不兑现”。第二，苏联提出关于德国的建议与警告英法不得破坏英苏、法苏条约的照会，已使西欧各国政府害怕人民反抗武装西德，害怕听从美国战争政策的后果。第三，美国统治集团内部在朝鲜战争失败后表现的极度混乱，已使西欧各国对美国的政策犹豫。
    在这种情形下，会议的公报虽然宣布了“获得一致协议”，但是离开艾奇逊原来在会上所企图迫使其仆从国家接受的计划还很远。许多帝国主义的通讯社与报纸都透露：美国如此匆促宣布成立的北大西洋统一侵略军，实际上并没有多大的保证。纽约时报说：“布鲁塞尔的决定是艰难的决定”，是“勉强”作出的。路透社记者忧郁地承认：“今日发表的公报强调布鲁塞尔会议采取决定时“全体一致”，但西方各国首都所怀的不安情绪，并未因这种保证而减低。”巴黎人士把布鲁塞尔会议公报描写为“含糊不清”，并认为：“虽然公报指出十二国达成了协议，然而却远没有预料的肯定。公报没有提到程序问题，在建立统一军方面似乎也没有艾森豪威尔一个时间的限度。不过有一件事情是明显的：就是来到布鲁塞尔决心迅速解决欧洲军问题的美国人已经被说服，答允慢慢地来干了。因为这个问题已被证明比美国所想像的更加复杂。”
    为什么问题如此复杂呢？
    合众社记者承认美国在建立北大西洋军方面的困难主要是兵力与兵源的极端缺乏。他把美国计划要建立的北大西洋统一侵略军称做“纸上的军队”，并认为：“据大西洋各国的观察”，要迅速使之成为能与苏联军队作战的力量的希望“是甚为渺茫的”。他在详细地把北大西洋侵略集团各国的兵力算过一笔总账以后，不得不叫苦说：“如果把北大西洋公约各国现有一切常备军明天就完全交与艾森豪威尔，其总数也不过大约一百四十万人，而且其中大半是没有经过实际作战训练的。”（合众社布鲁塞尔二十日电）
    这次组织统一侵略军的计划表明：美帝企图从西德来解决其兵力的不足。但是，合众社记者在十九日从法兰克福来的电讯中就承认：美国帝国主义要想使西德人民替它在侵略战争中当炮灰，“这个工作是不会容易的。在他们能够使德国军队和西方军队站在一起以前，西方各国的筹划者必须克服德国的剧烈反对。这种反对的基本原因是全国直言无讳的恐惧心理、普遍地冷淡和一个简单明了的事实，即：千百万德国人已讨厌战争了。就是推销布鲁塞尔计划的第一号推销员西德总理阿登纳似乎也不大乐意接受西方要他兜售的货物”。
    美国帝国主义面临的又一个困难是西欧各国政府害怕自己在美国的战争计划中首先遭到毁灭。以法国为例，据路透社伦敦十九日电称：“法国在近数周来的反应颇为冷淡。法国政界人士除传统地恐惧德国军事复兴外，诚然又已为苏联的警告所动。法国国民议会上周讨论外交问题时，右倾的农民党领袖巴杜与社会党议员麦耶，都要求政府于面临苏联的警告之际，谨慎从事，切勿轻率认可德国的重新武装。”而如果一旦发生战争，“法国必是首当其冲，这是法国每个人都不喜欢的”。
    西欧各国政府同时也害怕追随美国计划必然会招致无法解决的经济危机。据美联社法兰克福十五日电承认：“法国政府在想请求一笔经费以在印度支那进行一个小型军事同盟的军事努力时，就已经支撑不住，更不必说来办理一个充分的欧洲防务了。赋税已经很重的英国人不愿为了防务费用而放弃他们的幸福与福利事业。欧洲的小国存在着同样的问题。”
    在这种处处困难的情况下，合众社记者悲哀地叹息：“大西洋各国在本周的大西洋会议中，都保证在各方面不断努力，进行这项计划。但至今尚没有一国甚至开始进行部分的动员。”（合众社布鲁塞尔二十日电）
    北大西洋集团内的这一片凄凉景色，使它们的美国主人也大为烦恼。艾奇逊在会后说：“我们要做那种当我签订公约时就已开始进行的工作。到现在为止，我们所已经做的事情太少太慢了。我们需要走的路还非常遥远。过去我们把许多时间消耗在没有结果的事情上了。”造成艾奇逊这种烦恼的因素，也不能不使正待走马上任的北大西洋统一侵略军“最高司令”艾森豪威尔的前途布满着阴影。艾森豪威尔无可奈何地承认：“组织欧洲防御（应读为侵略）军的工作不会是容易的，也不会是迅速的。”
