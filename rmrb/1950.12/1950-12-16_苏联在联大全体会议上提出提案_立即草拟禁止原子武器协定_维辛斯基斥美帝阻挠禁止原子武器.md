Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 14th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of December 12th, first electing a special committee responsible for considering the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations and providing recommendations to the Assembly.

As is well known, at the beginning of the current session of the UN General Assembly, a resolution was passed to establish such a committee. At that time, the Assembly also suggested that the President of the Assembly, Mr. Entezam, should propose a list of seven countries that he believed should be represented on the committee.

At the December 12th UN General Assembly meeting, Entezam proposed that the committee should include representatives from seven countries: Canada, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Mexico, the Philippines, and Poland.

The Czechoslovak representative proposed that the composition of the special committee should be decided by secret ballot. All the candidates proposed by the President of the Assembly were approved.

Next, the Assembly discussed the issue of international control of atomic energy. As everyone knows, this issue is not a new one in the UN General Assembly. Despite the demands of millions of people around the world to prohibit atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and weapons of mass destruction, and despite demands to establish effective international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition, the Assembly, under the pressure of the US-British bloc delegations, has never taken any steps in this direction. On the contrary, the majority of the Assembly has been passing resolutions that approve the so-called Baruch Plan of the United States, which aims to monopolize the manufacture of atomic energy but does not stipulate any practical prohibition of atomic weapons.

At the plenary meeting on December 12th, the delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, Ecuador, the Netherlands, and Turkey jointly proposed a resolution on this issue. This proposal once again carefully avoids the main issue – the prohibition of atomic weapons. This proposal once again mentions the infamous Baruch Plan of the United States with approval. The proposal was inspired by American propaganda. It says that the implementation of the Baruch Plan "will lead to the effective prohibition of atomic weapons," etc. The operative part of the proposal suggests establishing a committee of twelve member states composed of the members of the Security Council as of January 1, 1950, and Canada, and designating this committee to review the coordination between the work of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the Conventional Armaments Commission, and whether it is appropriate to merge them into a new committee, the so-called Disarmament Commission. The report of the work of the twelve-nation committee will be submitted to the next session of the Assembly.

The Soviet delegation put forward its own proposal, which stated: "Because it believes that it is necessary to immediately begin drafting an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy, the Assembly decides: (1) To instruct the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission to resume its work in order to immediately begin drafting an agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and an agreement on international control of atomic energy, and to remember that these agreements should be concluded and implemented simultaneously; (2) To prepare the agreements mentioned in point 1 and to submit them to the Security Council no later than June 1, 1951."

The Australian representative, speaking in support of the eight-nation proposal, asserted that the atomic energy issue and the conventional armaments issue constitute a general issue, so the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the United Nations Conventional Armaments Commission should be merged. The Australian representative opposed the proposal made by the Soviet delegation and insisted that the proposal was "academic."

Then the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke. His speech took up most of the afternoon meeting, and the audience listened with great attention.

Vyshinsky first exposed the deliberate distortion by some people of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the issue under discussion. He pointed out that some representatives in this session of the United Nations General Assembly were doing this, and the US State Department had also done so in its official document "Atomic Energy and Foreign Policy" published in July 1950. In the above-mentioned document and in the speeches of some representatives at the Assembly, they all attempted to make it seem as if the main obstacle to solving the atomic issue was caused by the foreign policy of the Soviet government. Vyshinsky forcefully proved that it was the Soviet Union that had been tirelessly fighting for the prohibition of atomic weapons for five years, while the United States and its satellite states were fighting against the prohibition of atomic weapons, and they had taken all possible measures to improve atomic weapons and further expand the manufacture of atomic bombs.

Vyshinsky said that it was not the Soviet Union that was suffering from war neurosis, but the US ruling clique, who were engaged in a frenzied arms race, the main part of which was devoted to the manufacture of atomic weapons. He then drew everyone's attention to the seventh semi-annual report of the US Atomic Energy Commission and the statements of US President Truman and other politicians, which proved the frenzied activities of the United States in increasing the production and storage of atomic weapons. Vyshinsky continued that the US ruling clique was not satisfied with the atomic weapons race, they further intensified the manufacture of hydrogen bombs, and in doing so also said it was for peace and security. The US delegation and the US government spread the most hypocritical myth that the so-called US international control plan was the most effective means of prohibiting atomic weapons. Vyshinsky revealed that this argument was completely untenable. He proved that the real purpose of the American plan, in the final analysis, was to concentrate all power in the hands of American monopoly capitalists, allowing them to control atomic energy and the use of atomic energy resources around the world, as well as the production of atomic weapons. When the so-called American international control plan, namely the Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan, was drafted, the giants of the American monopoly capital groups such as Morgan, DuPont, Mellon, and Rockefeller were the most heavily involved, and it can even be said that the plan itself was planned by these people, which is really not accidental.

Vyshinsky pointed out that from here we can get a clear and direct explanation for many of the characteristics of this plan, which determine the entire nature of the plan, and in the words of the American newspapers, this plan is not to limit the military use of atomic energy, but to prevent international development for the social needs of atomic energy. Vyshinsky cited specific examples and documents to prove that the profits obtained from the expansion of armaments, especially from the manufacture of atomic weapons, are a very important reason for the opposition of the American "business" community to any proposal to prohibit atomic weapons, because such measures would interrupt the production of atomic bombs and would transfer capital to less profitable production. Vyshinsky pointed out that this commercial interest is one of the most important factors determining the trend of American policy on the atomic issue. However, the most important part of this issue is political and strategic considerations.

Most of Vyshinsky's speech was reading documents and citing facts to expose the reasons why the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international control were being obstructed, that is, the determination of the US-British ruling clique to prevent the prohibition of atomic weapons and international control. Vyshinsky then criticized in detail the American so-called international control plan, which cannot be used to achieve an agreement to prohibit atomic weapons, but only to ensure that American monopoly capitalists can take control of the world's atomic energy resources under the guise of international control and use them as they please.

Vyshinsky explained in detail the Soviet delegation's position, which is that the Assembly should sincerely, openly, clearly, and directly declare the prohibition of atomic weapons and that effective control must be established at the same time.

The Soviet proposal stipulates that conventions should be drafted based on the principles of prohibiting atomic weapons and implementing effective control. Vyshinsky emphasized that these conventions must be based on the following principles: that all contracting parties must be equal and respect each other's interests, and unconditionally abandon all attempts and plans to unilaterally and forcibly implement various principles that betray the aforementioned respect for the equal rights and interests of the contracting parties. Vyshinsky continued that therefore, it is necessary to abandon the arrogant notion that one country is superior to another, and to abandon the mania for world hegemony suffered by the American ruling clique.

After tracing the various decisions made by the Assembly on the issue under discussion, Vyshinsky reiterated that the annual meetings of the Assembly have, under the pressure of the American ruling clique, passed resolutions that are increasingly deviating from the main resolution passed by the 1946 Assembly, which required the prohibition of the production of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective international control to supervise the implementation of this resolution. Vyshinsky said that an analysis of the path the Assembly has taken over the past five years proves the statement of the US Atomic Energy Commission signed by Acheson et al. in March 1946, which stated that although the American ruling clique proposed a so-called international control plan for the prohibition of atomic weapons, it did not intend to abandon the production of atomic weapons in the slightest. They attempted to use their cunning control plan to prevent any possibility of reaching an agreement on the basis of prohibiting atomic weapons.

Vyshinsky explained in detail the Soviet plan on the atomic energy issue, which arose from the necessity of unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and simultaneously establishing strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. This plan stipulates that an international control committee should be established within the Security Council, which should have broad powers to conduct investigations, which guarantee that the committee can exercise strong international power. Vyshinsky emphasized that the plan proposed by the Soviet Union is completely in line with the fundamental and important interests of all peace-loving countries and even all mankind. After reading out various letters from organizations and the Second World Peace Congress requesting the prohibition of atomic weapons, Vyshinsky said: "This is the voice from the conscience of hundreds of millions of people, who, regardless of their profession, social status, party affiliation, or ideological views, demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and demand that those governments that first use this barbaric weapon of mass destruction of mankind be condemned as war criminals."

At the end of his speech, Vyshinsky read out the Soviet delegation's proposal on the issue under discussion, requesting the Assembly to adopt this proposal, and emphasized that only the path proposed by the Soviet Union, namely the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control, can guarantee the elimination of the threat of war and consolidate the peace and security of all countries.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, concluded his speech amidst the warm applause of several delegations.

The next speaker was the Swedish representative. He admitted that he himself was very skeptical about whether it was appropriate to merge the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the United Nations Conventional Armaments Commission according to the eight-nation proposal. But he also said that since this proposal only stipulates an investigation into whether such a merger is appropriate, the Swedish delegation is willing to support this proposal.

At the end of the meeting, the US representative spoke in support of the eight-nation proposal (the United States being one of the proposing countries). He insisted that this proposal could promote the establishment of effective control over both conventional armaments and atomic weapons. The US representative completely distorted the facts, attempting to blame the Soviet Union for the failure to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective control over atomic energy in the various competent agencies of the United Nations.

The plenary meeting then adjourned. The plenary meeting will continue to discuss this issue on December 13th.

    苏联在联大全体会议上提出提案            
    立即草拟禁止原子武器协定            
    维辛斯基斥美帝阻挠禁止原子武器
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十四日电：联合国大会全体会议十二月十二日下午首先选举负责考虑中国在联合国的代表权问题并向大会提供建议的特别委员会。
    如所周知，联合国大会本届会议开始之初即已通过成立这种委员会的决议，当时，大会并建议由大会主席安迪让提出他认为应有代表参加这个委员会的七国名单。
    在十二月十二日联大会议上，安迪让建议，该委员会应包括加拿大、厄瓜多尔、印度、伊拉克、墨西哥、菲律宾与波兰七个国家的代表。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表提议，特别委员会的组成应以秘密投票的方式决定。大会主席所提出的一切代表人选都得到批准。
    接着，大会讨论国际管制原子能的问题。大家都知道，这个问题在联大并不是一个新的问题。不顾全世界千百万人要求把原子武器作为侵略的武器、作为大规模毁灭人类的武器而加以禁止，不顾人们要求建立有效的国际管制以监督此项禁令之执行，大会在美英阵营代表团的压力下，从来没有在这方面采取任何步骤。相反地，大会的多数派却一直在通过一些决议，批准了美国的旨在使美国垄断原子能的制造但却丝毫不规定实际禁止原子武器的所谓巴鲁区计划。
    十二月十二日全体会议上，美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、加拿大、厄瓜多尔、荷兰与土耳其代表团提出关于这个问题的联合提案。这一提案再度小心翼翼地规避开主要的问题——禁止原子武器的问题。这一提案再度以赞同的态度提到美国的臭名昭彰的巴鲁区计划。这个提案从美国宣传中得到了启示。说，巴鲁区计划的实现“将导致原子武器的有效禁止”等等。提案的实效部分建议成立由一九五○年一月一日时的安理会会员国和加拿大联合组成的十二个会员国委员会，并指定这个委员会审查联合国原子能委员会与常规军备委员会的工作间的配合问题、以及把它们合并为新的委员会即所谓裁减军备委员会是否合宜的问题。十二国委员会工作结果的报告将提交大会下届会议。
    苏联代表团提出它自己的提案，这个提案说：“因为认为需要立即开始草拟关于禁止原子武器与管制原子能的协定，大会裁决：（一）指示联合国原子能委员会恢复其工作，以便立即开始草拟无条件禁止原子武器协定及国际管制原子能的协定，并记住这些协定应当缔结而同时付诸实施；（二）准备第一点中所提及的协定，并且最迟在一九五一年六月一日前要提交安全理事会。”
    澳大利亚代表在发言支持八国提案时断言，原子能问题与常规军备问题构成一个总的问题，所以联合国原子能委员会与联合国常规军备委员会应该予以合并。澳大利亚代表反对苏联代表团所提的提案，并且硬说这个提案是“学院式的”。
    然后苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言。他的发言占去了下午会议的大部时间，听众格外注意倾听。
    维辛斯基首先揭露某些人肆意歪曲苏联对正在讨论的这个问题的态度。他指出，在本届联合国大会当中有某些代表这样做，而美国国务院在一九五○年七月发表的官方文件“原子能与外交政策”中也曾这样做过。在上述的文件和某些代表在大会上的发言中，他们都企图把事情说成好像妨碍解决原子问题的主要障碍是由苏联政府的外交政策造成似的。维辛斯基有力地证明，五年以来不倦地为禁止原子武器而斗争的正是苏联，而美国和它的附庸国则在进行反对禁止原子武器的斗争，它们采取了一切可能的措施来改良原子武器和更进一步扩大原子弹的制造。
    维辛斯基说，患战争神经病的，不是苏联，而是美国统治集团，他们进行了疯狂的军备竞赛，其中主要部分就是致力于制造原子武器。他接着请大家注意美国原子能委员会的第七次半年报告以及美国总统杜鲁门和其他政治家的声明，这些东西都证明了美国在增加原子武器的生产和存储方面的狂热活动。维辛斯基继续说，美国统治集团并不满足于原子武器竞赛，他们更进而加紧了氢原子弹的制造，并且在这样做时也说是为了和平和安全。美国代表团和美国政府散布了最虚伪的神话，说美国的所谓国际管制计划是禁止原子武器的最有效手段。维辛斯基揭露了这种论调是完全站不住脚的。他证明，美国计划的真正目的，归根结底是要把全部权力集中在美国垄断资本家的手里，让他们控制原子能和全世界原子能资源的利用以及原子武器的生产。当所谓美国的国际管制计划、即艾奇逊——巴鲁区——李连塞尔计划草拟的时候，参与其事最力的就是摩根、杜邦、梅隆和洛克菲勒之流的美国垄断资本集团的巨头们，甚至可以说这计划本身就是这些人所谋划的，这实在并不是偶然的。
    维辛斯基指出，从这里我们便可以得到对于这计划的许多特点的清楚而直接的解释，这些特点决定了这计划的整个性质，用美国报纸的话来说，就是这计划并不是为了限制原子能的军事利用，而是要阻止国际间为了把原子能用于社会需要方面的发展。维辛斯基援引具体的例子和文件证明：从扩充军备运动、特别是从制造原子武器中所获得的利润，乃是美国“商业”界反对任何禁止原子武器的建议十分重大的理由，因为这种措施将使原子弹的生产中断，而将使资本转移到获利较少的生产方面去。维辛斯基指出：这种商业利益是决定美国对原子问题政策的倾向的最重要因素之一。但是，这个问题最重要的一部分是政治和军略方面的考虑。
    维辛斯基演说的大部分是宣读文件和引证事实，揭露禁止原子武器和建立国际管制所以受到阻挠的原因，即美英统治集团决心阻止禁止原子武器和国际管制的原因。维辛斯基接着详细批评美国的所谓国际管制计划，该计划并不能用来实现禁止原子武器的协议，只是能用来保证美国垄断资本家得以在国际管制的伪装下把全世界原子能的资源拿到手中听由他们随意利用。
    维辛斯基详细说明苏联代表团的立场，苏联立场是：大会应真诚地、公开地、明确地、直接地宣布禁止原子武器以及必须同时建立有效管制。
    苏联提案规定根据禁止原子武器和实行有效管制的原则草拟公约。维辛斯基强调称，这些公约必须以下列原则为基础：即各缔约国间必须平等并互相尊重各国的利益，无条件放弃所有一切一意孤行强制实施各种背弃上述尊重各缔约国的平等权利与利益的原则的要求和计划的企图。维辛斯基继称，因此，必需放弃这一国优于另一国的狂妄观念，放弃美国统治集团所患的独霸世界狂。
    维辛斯基在追溯了大会历来就目前讨论的这个问题所作的各种决定后，再度指出：大会每年的会议都在美国统治集团的压力下通过了一些决议，这些决议愈来愈离开一九四六年大会通过的主要决议，这个决议要求禁止原子武器的生产，要求建立有效的国际管制以监督这一决议的执行。维辛斯基称，分析过去五年来大会所经历过的途径便证明了一九四六年三月由艾奇逊等所签署的美国原子能委员会的声明，声明表示美国统治集团虽然提出所谓禁止原子武器的国际管制计划，但它却丝毫没有打算放弃原子武器的生产。他们企图利用其狡狯的管制计划来阻止在禁止原子武器的基础上达成任何协议的可能性。
    维辛斯基详细解释苏联关于原子能问题的计划，这个计划是根据无条件禁止原子武器并同时建立严格的国际管制以监督执行这种禁令的必要而产生的。这个计划规定，在安全理事会机构内成立一个国际管制委员会，该委员会应有广泛的权限进行调查，这种权限保证该委员会能运用强有力的国际权力。维辛斯基强调称，苏联提出的这个计划是完全符合所有爱好和平的各国人民乃至全体人类的基本的重大利益的。维辛斯基在宣读了各种组织及第二届世界保卫和平大会的若干要求禁止原子武器的来信以后称：“这就是亿万人民良心里发出来的呼声，他们不分职业、不分社会地位、不分党派、不分思想见解，都要求禁止原子武器，要求斥责那些首先使用这种大规模毁灭人类的野蛮武器的政府为战争罪犯。”
    维辛斯基演说结束时，宣读了苏联代表团提出关于正在讨论的问题的提案，要求大会通过这项提案，并着重指出：只有苏联所提出的途径，即无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际管制的途径，才能够保证消灭战争威胁，并巩固各国的和平与安全。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在若干代表团的热烈掌声中结束了他的演说。
    其次发言的是瑞典代表。他承认他自己对于按照八国提案将联合国原子能委员会和联合国常规军备委员会予以合并是否合宜一点，甚为怀疑。但他又说：既然这项提案仅仅规定调查这种合并是否得宜，瑞典代表团愿意支持这一提案。
    会议至最后，美国代表发言支持八国提案（按美国为提案国之一）。他硬说这项提案可以促成建立对于常规军备和原子武器两者的有效管制。美国代表完全歪曲事实，企图把联合国各主管机构中未能就禁用原子武器和建立对原子能的有效管制两点获致协议一事，归罪于苏联。
    全体会议随后散会。全体会议将于十二月十三日继续讨论这一问题。
