Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 15th (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly continued its plenary session on the afternoon of December 13th to discuss the issue of international control of atomic energy. The first speaker, the British representative Jebb, attempted to portray the situation as if there were "only one plan" regarding the atomic energy issue. He was referring to the US's so-called international control plan. Jebb said his delegation supported this plan. He believed that the hope of reaching an international agreement on the atomic energy issue was very slim, because, according to him, there was a "lack of mutual trust and cooperation" among countries. Jebb expressed the hope that the eight-nation proposal could provide an opportunity for the situation to improve, although he felt that this opportunity was "very small."

Jebb deliberately distorted facts known to the whole world and repeated the already exposed fabrications, insisting that the Soviet Union was hindering the conclusion of an international agreement on the implementation of international control over atomic energy.

The next speaker, the Polish representative Katz-Suchy, pointed out that the representatives of the US-British bloc were trying their best to turn the discussion of this issue into an abstract, scholastic debate, while avoiding discussing the substance of the issue under discussion. Katz-Suchy particularly emphasized that the Soviet delegation had devoted itself to exposing the US-British bloc's obstruction of effective measures to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international control over the use of atomic energy. The American ruling circles and those countries that support them are not interested in taking effective measures to prohibit atomic weapons because they think that by intensifying the production of atomic weapons, they can intimidate the people of the whole world, especially the people of Asia.

The majority of Katz-Suchy's speech was a well-reasoned criticism of the US's so-called international control plan. The purpose of this plan is to make all production of atomic energy subject to the interests of American monopoly capitalists.

The Polish representative elaborated on his delegation's position on the issue under discussion, which is to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and establish effective international control over atomic energy. Katz-Suchy particularly emphasized the importance of the Soviet proposal, pointing out that only these proposals can produce significant and positive results. Katz-Suchy said that the eight-nation proposal is intended to delay the solution of this important issue that is crucial to survival. Katz-Suchy finally urged the General Assembly to focus all its attention on the Soviet proposal, which was not only put forward by the Soviet people, but also reflected the wishes and hopes of the people of all countries in the world.

After the Egyptian representative made a brief statement saying that his delegation supported the eight-nation proposal, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Baranovksy, rose to speak. At the beginning of his speech, Baranovksy emphasized that the US's so-called international control plan, concocted according to the instructions of monopoly capitalists, reflected the military strategic goals of the American aggressive bloc. The Ukrainian delegation believes that this plan is by no means intended to guarantee peace and security, but is directly intended to enslave those undeveloped countries, because it gives American monopoly capitalists the right to interfere in the domestic affairs of various countries under the pretext of control.

Baranovksy pointed out that the US's policy on the use of atomic energy is based on a myth that now exists among the American ruling circles, which is that the country with the most atomic bomb reserves will hold supreme power in international relations. Baranovksy emphasized that the United States is expanding its atomic energy industry only to manufacture atomic weapons, not to meet civilian needs.

Baranovksy said that the Soviet Union's plan to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes and to establish strict international control over the implementation of this prohibition, is also aimed at using atomic energy as a new and infinite resource of power as soon as possible, so as to accelerate the development of the Soviet national economy.

Baranovksy exposed the hypocrisy of the British representative Jebb's speech, who falsely claimed that the governments of the United States and Britain hoped to reach an agreement with all relevant countries on the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. Baranovksy pointed out that the governments of these two countries completely disregarded the opinions of other countries, and tried every means to prevent even the discussion of this issue, let alone the conclusion of the agreement proposed by the Soviet Union.

After thoroughly criticizing the eight-nation proposal, Baranovksy urged the representatives to vote in favor of the Soviet proposal.

Towards the end of the discussion, the Belarusian representative Kiselev spoke. He mainly criticized the eight-nation proposal and analyzed the true meaning of the US's position on the issue under discussion. Kiselev pointed out that the American ruling circles deliberately obstructed the prohibition of atomic weapons and obstructed the formulation of measures to establish effective international control over the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes.

Kiselev also pointed out that the American ruling circles, by forcing the United Nations to accept its plan for the control of atomic energy, are attempting to gain control over the atomic energy industries of various countries and seize their atomic energy raw material reserves.

At the end of his speech, Kiselev read out many documents proving that the people of all countries in the world hope for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons.

After Kiselev's speech, the General Assembly proceeded to vote. A total of forty-seven votes were in favor of the eight-nation proposal, and five votes against (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), and three delegations abstained. Then the Soviet proposal was voted on, with five votes in favor (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland and Czechoslovakia), thirty-two votes against, and sixteen abstentions.

[Our Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: TASS, New York: At the United Nations General Assembly plenary session on December 12th and 13th, the US-British majority, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, also passed resolutions approving the illegal activity reports of the Economic and Social Council, in which representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia did not participate, and awarding "honorary belts" to the aggressor troops who armed intervention in Korea.

### 波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯代表在联大发言  痛斥美帝阻挠禁止原子武器  美英集团竟操纵多数通过“八国提案”

    波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯代表在联大发言            
    痛斥美帝阻挠禁止原子武器            
    美英集团竟操纵多数通过“八国提案”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十五日电：联合国大会十二月十三日下午全体会议继续讨论国际管制原子能问题。第一个发言的英国代表杰伯企图把事情说成彷佛关于原子能问题“仅有一种计划”似的。他心目中指的就是美国的所谓国际管制计划。杰伯说他的代表团支持这个计划。他认为达成关于原子能问题的国际协议的希望是很微小的，因为据他说，各国之间“缺乏互信和合作”。杰伯表示希望八国提案能使局势有好转的机会，虽然他觉得这种机会是“十分微小的”。
    杰伯故意歪曲全世界都知道的事实，把那些早已被揭穿的捏造谰言又重述一遍，硬说苏联阻碍缔结关于对原子能实施国际管制的国际协定。
    继起发言的波兰代表卡茨·苏琪指出：美英集团各国代表竭力要使关于这个问题的讨论变成抽象的学究式的辩论，而避免论及正在讨论中的这个问题的实质。卡茨·苏琪特别强调苏联代表团曾致力揭发美英集团在阻挠采取有效的措施来禁止原子武器并对原子能的使用建立国际管制。美国统治集团以及支持他们的那些国家，对于采取有效的措施以禁止原子武器一事不感兴趣，因为他们以为凭借加紧原子武器的生产，就可以吓倒全世界、特别是亚洲各国人民。
    卡茨·苏琪发言中大部分是对美国的所谓国际管制计划予以理由充分的批评。这种计划目的在使原子能的全部生产都服从美国垄断资本家的利益。
    波兰代表详细阐明他的代表团对于正在讨论中的这个问题的立场，就是无条件禁止原子武器，并且对原子能确立有效的国际管制。卡茨·苏琪特别强调苏联提案的重要性，他指出：唯有这些建议才能产生显著的、积极的效果。卡茨·苏琪说：八国提案是要把这个与生存攸关的重大问题的解决延搁起来。卡茨·苏琪最后敦促联大以全部注意力集中在苏联提案上，苏联提案不仅是苏联人民提出的，而且也反映全世界各国人民的心愿与希望。
    在埃及代表发表简短声明说他的代表团支持八国提案后，乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基起立发言。巴拉诺夫斯基在开始演说时，就强调指出：根据垄断资本家的训令而编造出来的美国所谓国际管制的计划，反映出美国侵略集团的军事战略目的。乌克兰代表团认为，这个计划决不是要保障和平与安全，而是直接要奴役那些不发展的国家，因为它以管制为借口，使美国垄断资本家有权去干涉各国的国内事务。
    巴拉诺夫斯基指出，美国的关于利用原子能的政策是以美国统治集团中间现在存在的一种神话为基础的，这个神话便是拥有最多原子弹贮藏的国家在国际关系中将握有至高无上的权力。巴拉诺夫斯基强调说，美国扩展原子能工业只是为了制造原子武器，并不是为了迎合平民的需要。
    巴拉诺夫斯基说，苏联的禁止为军事目的利用原子能、并对实施这种禁令建立严格的国际管制的计划，其目的同时在于早日把原子能作为一种新的无穷的能力资源而加以利用，以便加速苏联国民经济的发展。
    巴拉诺夫斯基揭露了英国代表杰伯的发言的虚伪性，杰伯伪称美国和英国的政府希望与一切有关国家就禁止使用原子武器一事达成协议。巴拉诺夫斯基指出，这两国政府完全无视其他国家的意见，并且竭力用一切方法来阻止甚至关于这个问题的讨论，至于缔结苏联所提出的协定则更不必谈了。
    巴拉诺夫斯基透彻地批评了八国提案之后，敦促各代表投票赞成苏联提案。
    在讨论快要结束时，白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫发言。他主要是批评八国提案，并且分析美国对讨论中的问题所采取的立场的真正意义。基塞列夫指出，美国统治集团故意阻挠禁止原子武器，并且阻挠拟订对禁止为军事目的利用原子能建立国际有效管制的办法。
    基塞列夫同时指出，美国统治集团借强迫联合国接受它的关于管制原子能的计划的方法，企图获得对各国原子能工业的控制权，并一手攫取它们的原子能原料的贮藏。
    基塞列夫在他的演说的结束时宣读了许多证明世界各国人民都希望无条件禁止原子武器的文件。
    基塞列夫发言之后，大会进行表决。赞成八国提案的共有四十七票，反对者五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克），三个代表团弃权。然后表决苏联的提案，赞成者五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克），反对者三十二票，十六票弃权。
    【本报讯】据新华社十六日讯：塔斯社纽约讯：在十二、十三日联合国全体会议上，美英多数还不顾苏联及人民民主国家的反对通过了批准没有中、苏、波、捷代表参加的经社理事会的非法活动报告，和颁发“荣誉带”予武装干涉朝鲜的侵略军等决议。
