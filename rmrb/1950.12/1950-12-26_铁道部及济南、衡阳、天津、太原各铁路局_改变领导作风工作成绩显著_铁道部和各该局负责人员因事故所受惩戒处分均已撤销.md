    [News from Our Newspaper] The People's Supervision Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government has revoked disciplinary actions against personnel at or above the bureau director level of the Ministry of Railways and its subordinate Jinan, Hengyang, Tianjin, and Taiyuan Railway Administrations.
    Since major accidents such as train collisions and casualties occurred successively in the Jinan, Hengyang, Tianjin, and Taiyuan Railway Administrations under the Ministry of Railways in the spring of this year, leading personnel of the Ministry of Railways and various railway administrations have been able to accept the painful lessons, launch a campaign to "eradicate bureaucracy in the railway system," change their style, improve their work, go deep into the field, and earnestly study countermeasures to prevent traffic accidents. The Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has uniformly formulated transportation regulations and systems related to train operation. With the vigilance of all employees in various railway administrations, emphasis on safety, and active implementation, traffic accidents in railway administrations across the country have been greatly reduced in the past six months. The average daily reduction is approximately 44% compared to January and February. The number of traffic accidents in the Tianjin Railway Administration in the second quarter decreased by 43% compared to the first quarter. The Jinan, Hengyang, and Taiyuan Railway Administrations have all made significant achievements in eliminating accidents and ensuring traffic safety. In addition, in terms of engineering construction, various railway administrations have also brought into play the high enthusiasm and creativity of employees, paid attention to economy, overcome many difficulties in materials, tools, and technology, and completed or exceeded engineering tasks. The Jinan Railway Administration overcame all difficulties in seven or eight months of hard work, overcame the rare flood on the Huai River in the past 20 years, and completed the Mingguang Bridge and Huai River Bridge projects on June 25th and July 7th respectively. The Hengyang Railway Administration not only repaired the main bridges of the Yuehan, Zhejjiang-Jiangxi, and Xianggui Eastern Sections, which were severely damaged by the White bandits, according to the annual plan set by the Ministry, but also collected waste materials to overcome material difficulties and reopened the Xianggui Western Section; and actively organized forces to repair bridges, completing eleven main bridges in the first half of the year, exceeding the annual planned target by 55% without increasing any funding. In the second quarter, the Taiyuan Railway Administration not only completed the unfinished bridge project from the first quarter but also completed the second quarter's project ahead of schedule: the number of large bridges exceeded the plan by 25%, and the number of medium and small bridges exceeded the plan by 24%. The Tianjin Railway Administration repaired thirteen large bridges and one hundred and ninety-three medium and small bridges in the first and second quarters, which is also a very significant achievement.
    Based on the above work achievements of the Ministry of Railways and various railway administrations in eliminating accidents and engineering construction in the past six months, the State Administration Council has issued an order to cancel the disciplinary actions previously imposed on Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, Vice Minister Lu Zhengcao, and bureau director-level personnel of various railway administrations due to major accidents. The cancelled disciplinary actions include: the criticism received by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan and Vice Minister Lu Zhengcao for the Huaqiying train collision accident on January 23rd of this year; the warning received by Zhen Tao, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau; the demerit recorded for Chen Dafan, Director of the Jinan Railway Administration, Gui Peng, Political Commissar, and Zhao Huanwen, Deputy Director; the warning received by Guo Weicheng, Director of the Hengyang Railway Administration, Ma Zai, Political Commissar, and Liu Chuanshu, Deputy Director, for the Miluo train separation collision accident on March 22nd; the demerit recorded for Guo Weicheng for the Leiyang train collision accident on February 7th; the warning received by Guo Hongtao, Director of the Tianjin Railway Administration, and Liu Yingcai, Deputy Director, for the train collision accident in Cangxian on February 4th; and the warning received by Wang Xiaobin, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Railway Administration, and Li Xinbo for the locomotive overturning accident on the South Tongpu Railway on February 20th.
