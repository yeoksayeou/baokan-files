(Reported by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Dispatch from Bucharest, TASS: The Executive Bureau Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, from the 1st to the 7th. Those attending the meeting included WFTU President Vittorio, Vice Presidents Kuznetsov, Liu Ningyi (representing Liu Shaoqi), Lellrip, Toledano, Piñia, Diallo, Supka, General Secretary Saillant, Secretaries Gilbert and Rostovsky, and others.

The meeting listened to the report by WFTU General Secretary Saillant on the WFTU's struggle to defend peace, followed by a heated discussion, and passed a resolution on the report.

The meeting sent a telegram to the United Nations, representing the 78 million members of the WFTU, requesting the prompt implementation of the recommendations in the Second World Peace Congress and the appeal to the United Nations.

On the 8th, a mass rally of over 10,000 people was held in Bucharest to celebrate the successful conclusion of the WFTU Executive Bureau meeting.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Bucharest, 9th: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution on the tasks of the WFTU in the struggle to defend peace, which reads as follows:

(1) The Executive Bureau of the WFTU points out that since the meeting of the Executive Committee of the WFTU in Budapest (May 1950), the characteristic of this period has been that the forces of imperialism have moved from preparing for war to direct aggression. U.S. imperialism has intensified its efforts to realize its conspiracy to seize world hegemony. At the behest of the masters of trusts and monopolies, the U.S. military has attacked the absolutely innocent Korean people, destroying and ravaging the country, directly threatening China, and damaging and bombing Chinese territory. Figures in the U.S. government have also used armed intervention to suppress the national liberation movements of other countries.

U.S. imperialism is trying its best to stir up the flames of world war, which will spread to all countries, bringing death and destruction everywhere. The aggressor Truman shamelessly announced that the U.S. ruling clique intends to continue the predatory war in Korea for the sake of imperialism's hopeless new adventure.

(2) The imperialists are panicked by the growing strength of the people's movement to defend peace. The path of the warmongers is blocked by the people of all countries, who have gradually become aware of their own strength and are fully determined to thwart the criminal plans of a handful of exploiters who seek to maintain their rule and increase their profits.

The unanimous will of the people of all countries to defend peace has been particularly vividly demonstrated at the Second World Peace Congress. The historical resolutions of the Second Congress must arouse the attention of all working people. The Second Congress has demonstrated the will of hundreds of millions of ordinary people in all countries of the world, that is, to take the cause of defending peace into their own hands.

(3) The working masses in capitalist countries are suffering deeply from the consequences of the war economy. In these countries, peaceful production has turned to war production, and the manufacture of consumer goods has been curtailed. The living standards and wages of the working masses are being reduced, while working hours are being extended. Due to increased military spending, taxes have increased, and trade union rights and the democratic freedoms of the working masses have been undermined. At the same time, prices are soaring, the profits of trusts and monopolies are soaring, the concentration of industry is intensifying, and the state is increasingly subservient to the will of the capitalists—the mega-billionaires.

As far as the workers are concerned, on the one hand, they face peace and further struggles to improve living conditions, and on the other hand, they face a war that will cause new, countless victims, destruction, and poverty. It is precisely for this reason that the working people express their deep concern for the heroic struggle to defend peace.

(4) Proceeding from this point, the Executive Bureau of the WFTU unanimously agrees with and warmly supports the various resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress.

The resolution of the Executive Bureau of the WFTU quoted the resolution of the World Peace Congress, and stated: The Executive Bureau of the WFTU welcomes the establishment of the World Peace Council—the congress of the people of all countries—to undertake the lofty task of defending lasting and true peace, which is fully in line with the interests of the people of all countries.

(5) The WFTU recommends to the central leading organs of trade unions in all countries, to the Trade Union Internationals (the industry departments of the WFTU), and to all trade union organizations:

	1. Through newspapers, radio, films, trade union rallies, representative conferences, workplaces, etc., make all working people generally aware of the resolutions of the Second Peace Congress;

	2. Request members of national parliaments and national governments to effectively implement the various resolutions of the World Peace Congress and to pursue policies in the United Nations that are consistent with these resolutions;

	3. Organize more resolute actions by working people to oppose the manufacture and transport of armaments;

	4. Strengthen solidarity with the people of colonies and dependent countries struggling for national liberation, and provide greater assistance to the Korean people who have become victims of U.S. aggression;

	5. Formulate and implement concrete plans to create a strong solidarity movement to prevent the U.S. ruling clique from implementing plans to rearm, especially to remilitarize Germany and Japan, as the U.S. ruling clique wants to turn Germany and Japan into aggressive countries again;

	6. Closely link the struggle to defend peace with the struggle to satisfy the pressing and vital demands of the working people;

	7. Demand reductions in military spending, formulate and implement concrete plans to expand socially beneficial undertakings, raise the living standards of the working people, and use the money saved from reducing military spending for this purpose;

	8. Strengthen ties with trade union organizations that are not members of the WFTU in order to implement concrete actions to defend peace;

	9. Unite all organized and unorganized working people in the struggle to defend peace;

	10. Resolutely expose the harmful activities of the divisive leaders of the so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the secretariats of the International Trade Secretariats, who are doing their utmost to use political tactics to conceal their true faces as docile henchmen of imperialist warmongers.

	11. Expand and consolidate the peace committees in enterprises, make them more active, and establish them where peace committees have not yet been established.

(6) The Executive Bureau instructs the Secretariat of the WFTU:

	1. Strengthen propaganda to expose the conspiracies of the imperialists; through its periodicals, pamphlets, newspapers, and radio, publicize the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the peace-defending activities carried out by the central leading organs of trade unions in various countries to the working people, so that each member organization of the WFTU can utilize the positive experiences of the central leading organs of trade unions in other countries;

	2. Study and draw the attention of the central leading organs of trade unions in various countries to the positive and negative results of the activities of peace committees in enterprises, and formulate concrete recommendations for the future tasks of these committees;

	3. Support and assist the joint actions of working people and trade union organizations in various countries (especially European countries) to prevent the rearmament of Germany;

	4. Assist the central leading organs of trade unions in various countries to send worker delegations to visit each other, and widely disseminate the reports of these delegations;

	5. Promote organizational and propaganda work in colonial and dependent countries, emphasizing the relationship between the struggle to defend peace and the struggle for national liberation;

	6. Submit recommendations to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations to stipulate reductions in military spending and use these funds to raise the living standards of working people in urban and rural areas;

	7. In conjunction with the various Trade Union Internationals affiliated with the WFTU, formulate recommendations on the establishment of normal trade and cultural relations between countries.

    世界工联执行局举行会议
    通过关于为保卫和平而斗争的决议
    【本报讯】据新华社综合塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议于一日至七日在罗马尼亚京城布加勒斯特举行。出席会议的有世界工联主席维多里奥，副主席库兹涅佐夫、刘少奇的代表刘宁一、勒里普、托列达诺、皮尼亚、迪亚洛、苏普卡，总书记赛扬，书记吉伯特和罗斯托夫斯基等人。
    会议听取了世界工联总书记赛扬所作关于世界工联为保卫和平而斗争的报告后，进行了热烈的讨论，并就这一报告通过决议。
    会议致电联合国，代表世界工联的七千八百万会员，要求尽速实行第二届世界和大致联合国呼吁书中的各项建议。
    八日，布加勒斯特举行了一万余人的群众大会，庆祝世界工联执行局会议的胜利闭幕。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布加勒斯特九日电：世界工会联合会执行局通过了关于世界工联在为保卫和平而斗争中的任务的决议，内容如下：
    （一）世界工联执行局指出：自从在布达佩斯举行世界工联执行委员会的会议（一九五○年五月）以来，这一段时期的特征是：帝国主义的势力已从准备战争进入直接侵略了。美帝国主义已加紧力求实现其夺取世界霸权的阴谋计划。在托辣斯和垄断企业主子们的命令下，美军进攻了绝对无辜的朝鲜人民，毁灭并蹂躏着这个国家，直接威胁着中国，损害并轰炸着中国的领土。美国政府方面人士也使用武装干涉手段去压制其他各国人民的民族解放运动。
    美帝国主义竭力要煽动世界的烽火，这一烽火将会蔓延到所有一切国家去，把死亡和毁灭带到各处去。侵略者杜鲁门无耻地宣布美国统治集团意图为了帝国主义毫无希望的新冒险，而在朝鲜继续进行掠夺性的战争。
    （二）帝国主义者看到人民保卫和平运动的日益壮大的力量而惊慌失措。战争贩子的道路为各国人民所拦阻，各国人民已逐渐觉悟到自身的力量，并且完全决心要挫败力图维持其统治及增加其利润的一小撮剥削者的犯罪计划。
    各国人民对保卫和平的万众一心的意志，已在第二届世界保卫和平大会上特别生动地表现出来，二届和大的历史性的决议一定要唤起全体劳动人民的注意。二届和大已表现出全世界各国亿万普通人民的意志，就是一定要把保卫和平的事业掌握在自己的手里。
    （三）资本主义各国的劳苦大众，已因战争经济的后果而苦难深重。在这些国家中，和平的生产又转向战争的生产了，消费品的制造被紧缩了。劳苦大众的生活标准和工资正在降低，而工作时间却延长了。由于增加军费，捐税增多了，工会权利和劳苦大众的民主自由受到了摧残。同时，物价飞涨，托辣斯和垄断企业的利润激增，工业的集中趋于强化，国家越来越依从资本家们——巨亿富翁们的意旨。
    就工人们而言，一方面面临着和平及为改善生活条件而进行更进一步的斗争，一方面又面临着将引起新的无数的牺牲者、破坏和贫困的战争。正因为这个缘故，劳动人民对于为保卫和平而英勇地斗争，表示切身的关心。
    （四）世界工联执行局从这一点出发，一致赞同并且热忱地拥护第二届世界和大的各项决议。
    世界工联执行局的决议中引用了世界和大的决议，并称：世界工联执行局欢迎成立世界保卫和平委员会——各国人民的大会，来负起保卫持久的真正和平的崇高任务，而这是与所有各国人民的利益完全符合的。
    （五）世界工联向各国工会中央领导机关、向各业工会国际（世界工联各产业部）、并向一切工会组织建议：
    一、经由报纸、广播、电影、工会集会、代表会议、工作场所等等，使一切劳动人民普遍明了二届和平大会的各项决议；
    二、要求各国议会议员和各国政府切实地实施世界和大的各项决议，并且要在联合国中推行与这些决议一致的政策；
    三、组织劳动人民更加坚决的行动来反对制造和运输军火；
    四、加强对为争取民族解放而斗争的殖民地和附属国人民的团结一致，并且要给予成为美国侵略下之牺牲品的朝鲜人民以更大的援助；
    五、拟订并且实施关于创造强大的团结运动的具体计划，以便阻止美国统治集团实行重整军备特别是重新将德国及日本军事化的计划，盖美国统治集团再度想使德国和日本变成侵略的国家；
    六、把为保卫和平而进行的斗争，跟那为满足劳动人民的迫切的切身要求而进行的斗争密切联系起来；
    七、要求削减军费，拟订并且实行具体的计划，以扩大对社会有利的事业，提高劳动人民的生活水平，把那些由于削减军费而节省下来的金钱运用到这一方面来；
    八、加强与非世界工联会员的各工会组织的联系，以贯彻为保卫和平而采取的具体行动；
    九、在为保卫和平而斗争中，把一切有组织的和没有组织的劳动人民都团结起来；
    十、坚决地揭发所谓“国际自由工会联合会”与国际各业工会书记处的分裂派领袖们的有害活动，他们竭力运用政治策略手段来掩藏他们充当帝国主义战争贩子的温顺的帮凶人的真面目。
    十一、扩大并且巩固各企业中的保卫和平委员会，使它们更加活跃起来，在还没有成立保卫和平委员会的地方，把它们成立起来。
    （六）执行局责成世界工联书记处：
    一、加强宣传，以揭露帝国主义者的阴谋；通过它的期刊、小册子、报纸和无线电，向劳动人民宣传第二届世界和大的决议以及各国工会中央领导机关所进行的保卫和平的活动，以便使世界工联的每一会员组织能够利用其他国家工会中央领导机关的积极的经验；
    二、研究并促使各国的工会中央领导机关注意各企业和平委员会活动的积极的与消极的结果，并为这些委员会的未来任务拟订具体的建议；
    三、支持并协助各国（特别是欧洲各国）劳动人民与工会组织的联合行动，以阻止德国的重整军备；
    四、协助各国工会中央领导机关互相派遣工人代表团参观，并将这些代表团的报告广为传布；
    五、推进殖民地与附属国家的组织工作与宣传工作，强调指出保卫和平的斗争与争取民族解放的斗争之间的关系；
    六、向联合国经社理事会提出建议，规定削减军费，并把这些款项用以提高城乡劳动人民的生活标准；
    七、会同世界工联所属的各工会国际，拟定关于建立各国间正常贸易与文化关系的建议。
