    Czechoslovak representative Hachaidu spoke against the six-nation proposal. He asked the United Nations General Assembly to note that there was no need or reason to discuss the six-nation proposal, because there was not and could not be any fact or evidence to show that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had interfered. He believed that the disastrous situation of the American troops in Korea was already doomed when the American troops launched a bloody intervention against the Korean people. Hachaidu stressed that the Chinese volunteer forces fighting the American aggressors were not only defending their brothers, the Korean people, but also defending their own independence and survival, because the American aggression against Korea was only a link in the overall expansion plan of American imperialism to enslave China. Hachaidu firmly opposed including the six-nation proposal on the so-called interference in Korea by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Next to speak was the American representative Austin, who again insisted that there was indeed interference by "Chinese Communist troops" in Korea. He insisted that it was currently impossible to expect the Security Council to take positive action on this issue, and he urged the United Nations General Assembly to consider this issue as a major and urgent one.
    British representative Younger insisted that the purpose of the six-nation proposal was to localize the conflict and end the war in Korea.

    捷代表哈奇杜发言反对六国提案
    中国志愿部队不仅保卫朝鲜兄弟也是保卫他们自己的独立和生存
    英国代表杨格硬说六国建议的目的使冲突局部化并结束朝鲜的战事。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜发言反对六国提案。他请联合国大会注意没有必要也没有理由来讨论六国提案，因为没有也不可能有任何事实或证据表明中华人民共和国中央人民政府有干涉的行为。他认为，早在美国军队对朝鲜人民发动血腥干涉的时候，美国军队在朝鲜所处的灾难处境就已经注定了。哈奇杜强调说，正在和美国侵略者作战的中国志愿部队不仅是在保卫他们的兄弟——朝鲜人民，而且也是在保卫他们自己的独立和生存，因为美国对朝鲜的侵略只不过是力图奴役中国的美帝国主义总的扩张计划中的一个环节而已。哈奇杜坚决反对把所谓中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜的六国提案列入联合国大会的议程。
    接着发言的是美国代表奥斯汀，他再次硬说朝鲜境内的确发生了“中国共产党军队”的干涉。他硬说目前不可能期望安全理事会在这个问题来采取积极的行动，他敦促联合国大会把这个问题当作重大而迫切的问题来考虑。
