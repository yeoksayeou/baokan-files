Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: The speech made by former US President and reactionary Republican figure Hoover on the 20th, which vehemently criticized the current foreign policy of the Truman administration, has brought to the surface the contradictions and divisions within the US ruling group that have been amplified by the disastrous defeat in the Korean War. These contradictions and divisions are currently intensifying around the debate over supporting or opposing Hoover's suggestions.

The reactionary columnists Alsop brothers of the New York Herald Tribune described the turmoil caused by Hoover's speech in Washington political circles as "a new and extreme form of isolationism produced by a failing business. This defeatism is now terribly permeating this chaotic city." United Press International's Washington dispatch stated that Hoover's "demands have sparked the largest national debate since the Lend-Lease Act" and "the most serious division in Congress over foreign policy in a decade."

Agence France-Presse pointed out: Hoover's speech "represents the suggestions of a very important part of the American ruling class." It quickly gained the support of most Republicans, a section of the business community, and the Hearst, Howard, and many other newspaper groups. Reactionary Republican Senate leaders Wherry and Martin both expressed agreement with Hoover's views. Many Republican senators focused their criticism on the Truman administration's sending American troops to Europe to die. Martin said: "We must not disperse our forces." Bridges said that Congress must decide "whether to keep our military forces in America to our advantage, or whether we should take our troops to Western Europe at risk." Bricker stated: "We must withdraw our troops back home to defend our own coasts." Some American newspapers seem to think that Hoover's proposal is the only way to be saved in the vast ocean of failure. The Chicago Daily Tribune believes that Hoover's approach "can save the lives of millions of American men destined to suffer useless sacrifices under the Truman-Acheson-Dewey-Eisenhower plan." The "Daily News" believes: "Hoover's opinion reflects the conclusion reached by an increasing number of Americans, namely: that they alone cannot determine the fate of the entire non-communist world, and if the United States continues to act in the current manner, the United States itself may go bankrupt due to the exhaustion of national strength."

Newspapers supporting Hoover sadly admitted that even if Hoover's opponents accuse Hoover's theory of being isolationist, this is only what American imperialism has to accept after failure. The Scripps-Howard's New York World-Telegram stated: "Hoover's theory may be called 'isolationism'. This is only so in the following sense: a country can be isolated by events it cannot control. If we are a powerful island in a sea of weakness and disappointment, it is not due to our fault or decision, but simply because we are abandoned by those who are cold-hearted and obstruct surrender." The "American" newspaper of Waterbury, Connecticut, also helplessly said: "This is not voluntary isolationism" but "isolationism determined by the power of practical needs."

From these remarks, people can see how large a part of the American ruling group has had to openly admit the fact that the current American aggression policy has gone bankrupt. However, the aggression routes they themselves have proposed have also been proven by their opponents to be dead ends. Truman administration officials, most Democrats, and some newspapers have also launched sharp counterattacks against Hoover's suggestions.

Secretary of State Acheson refuted Hoover's claims tit-for-tat, believing that this "means failure and frustration, and it is impossible to succeed." He believes that if the United States withdraws from the Eurasian continent, the power that grows from this vast land "can eliminate the power of the United States." Acheson said: Hoover's policy is "a policy of defeat without a fight, it can only lead to surrender and failure." Army Chief of Staff Collins said: If the United States loses Western Europe, it is extremely doubtful whether it can survive. Democratic Senator Lehman said: "I do not agree that the defense line can be set on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We must help strengthen our allies, otherwise we will be isolated and have no friends in the world." The New York Times, Washington Star, and other newspapers that usually reflect official opinions oppose Hoover's policy. The Washington Star said: If Hoover's policy is implemented, "we will have to live in armed camps indefinitely, and even without actual war, we will exhaust our resources and invite the economic decline that Hoover warned against."

This division, which is currently unfolding fiercely within the US ruling group, is still expanding. However, neither Truman's nor Hoover's aggression plans can find a way out for American imperialism. The only thing people can discover from these fierce attacks is that both sides have helplessly admitted the ironclad fact that the US aggression policy has failed. As Truman confessed in his speech on the 30th, "America is facing an unprecedented crisis."

    胡佛演说引起的争论正急剧发展
    暴露美统治集团内部分歧扩大 
    争论双方都承认美国侵略政策已失败
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国前总统、共和党反动头子胡佛于二十日发表的猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府现行外交政策的演说，已使美国统治集团内部因侵朝战争惨败而扩大的矛盾与分歧趋于表面化。这种矛盾与分歧目前正围绕着赞成或反对胡佛建议的争论而急剧发展。
    纽约先驱论坛报反动评论家阿尔索普兄弟二十二日在其专栏中，把胡佛演说在华盛顿政界中所引起的骚动，称作是“由失败主业产生的一种新的极端的孤立主义。这种失败主义现在正恐怖地弥漫在这个混乱的城市中”。合众社华盛顿电称胡佛的“要求已引起租借法案以来最大的一次全国辩论”，“是十年以内国会对外交政策最严重的分歧”。
    电通社指出：胡佛的演说“代表了美国统治阶级中很重要的一部分建议”。它迅速获得到共和党方面大部分人，和企业界的一部分人以及赫斯特系、霍华德系与其他许多报纸的支持。参院共和党反动领袖惠利和马丁都表示同意胡佛的意见。许多共和党参议员集中抨击杜鲁门政府派美国军队到欧洲去送死。马丁说：“我们不可分散我们的兵力。”勃里奇说，必须由国会决定“是把我们的军事力量保留在美国对我们有利呢，还是应该把我们的部队拿到西欧去冒险”。布瑞克称：“我们必得抽调军队回国保卫我们自己的海岸。”有些美国报纸看来，似乎胡佛的主张是美国在茫茫的失败海洋中唯一得救之道。芝加哥每日论坛报认为胡佛的办法“可以拯救在杜鲁门——艾奇逊——杜威——艾森豪威尔方案下注定要遭受无益牺牲的百万美国男儿的生命”。“每日新闻”认为：“胡佛的意见反映了美国越来越多的人所达到的结论，即：他们独自是不能决定所有非共产世界的命运的，如果美国继续照目前方式行动下去，美国本身可能因为耗尽全国力量而破产。”
    支持胡佛的报纸悲哀地承认：即使胡佛的反对者指责胡佛的理论是孤立主义，但这也只是美帝国主义在失败后所不得不接受的。斯克利浦斯霍华德系纽约世界电讯报就说：“胡佛的理论也许会被称做‘孤立主义’。这只有在下列意义上才是如此：一个国家可以被它控制不了的事件孤立起来的。假使我们是在一个柔弱与失望的大海中的一个有力量的孤岛，那并不是由于我们的过失或决定，而是仅仅因为我们被那些冷漠无情与阻挠投降的人们所遗弃的。”康涅狄格州沃特白里城的“美国人报”也无可奈何地说：“这不是自愿选择的孤立主义”，而是“实际需要的力量所决定了的孤立主义”。
    人们从这些言论中可以看到美国统治集团内部已有多大的一部分不得不公开承认美国现行侵略政策已陷于破产的这一事实，但是，他们自己所提出的侵略路线，也同样被他们的反对者证明是死路一条。杜鲁门政府官员、民主党方面的大部分人与若干报纸同样也对胡佛建议提出了尖锐的反击。
    美国务卿艾奇逊针锋相对地驳斥胡佛的主张，而认为这“意味着失败与挫折，是没有成功可能的”。他认为如果美国退出欧亚大陆，从这一大片土地上生长起来的力量“可以消灭美国的力量”。艾奇逊说：胡佛的政策是“一种不打自败的政策，它只能导向投降与失败”。陆军参谋长柯林斯说：如果美国失去西欧，那么它是否能生存下去就极可怀疑。民主党参议员雷曼说：“我不同意防线可设在大西洋和太平洋。我们必须协助加强我们的盟国，否则我们自身将陷于孤立，在世界上没有任何友人。”纽约时报、华盛顿明星报等通常反映官方意见的报纸都反对胡佛的政策。华盛顿明星报说：如果实行胡佛的政策，“我们就将不得不无限制地在武装的军营中生活，甚至没有实际的战争，就会耗尽我们的资源，而招来胡佛所警告的经济衰败”。
    目前在美国统治集团内部激烈展开的这种分歧还正在扩大。但是，不论杜鲁门的还是胡佛的侵略计划，都不可能为美帝国主义找到出路。人们从上面这些激烈的攻讦中所唯一能发现的，只是双方都已无可奈何地承认美国侵略政策业已失败的铁的事实。正如杜鲁门三十日演说时所供认的，“美国面临一个空前的危机”。
