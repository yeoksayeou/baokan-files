Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League, at its Sixth Plenary Session today, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to express its respect. The telegram stated: "Thanks to your correct leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party, in the past short year, the Chinese people have repelled a century of imperialist aggression and overthrown thousands of years of feudal oppression. On the political, economic, military, and cultural fronts, we have achieved unprecedented victories and laid the foundation for an independent, democratic, and happy New China. However, the imperialists, headed by US imperialism, are jealous of the great victory of our people and fear the growing strength of our country. They have openly invaded our territory of Taiwan, attacked our neighbor Korea, and even repeatedly violated our borders, massacred innocent people, and destroyed public and private property. If this mad and unreasonable attack is not immediately stopped, the Chinese people will again be subjected to the same aggression and devastation as by the Japanese invaders. Therefore, the Congress unanimously resolved to call on all members of the League, under your leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party, to take "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" as our current central political task, and to prove with action the oath we made in the joint declaration. We must accelerate the increase of our national defense strength, effectively support the great battle being waged in Korea, and consolidate and expand our great victories. In order to expand our strength to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, we also unanimously resolved to consolidate and develop the organization of our China Democratic League, and called on all members, under your leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party, to consolidate and expand our people's democratic united front, and the anti-aggression front of world peace and democracy."

    民盟六中全会电毛主席致敬
    【新华社十日讯】中国民主同盟中央委员会第六次全体会议今日致电毛主席致敬。电文称：“由于您和中国共产党的正确领导，在过去短短的一年中，中国人民击退了百年来的帝国主义侵略，推翻了数千年来的封建压迫，在政治、经济、军事、文化战线上，获得了空前的胜利，奠立了独立民主幸福的新中国的基础。但是以美帝为首的帝国主义者，嫉妒我们人民的伟大胜利，畏惧我国力量的日益壮大，竟公然侵略我们的领土台湾，进攻我们的邻邦朝鲜，甚且屡犯我国边境，屠杀无辜人民，毁坏公私财产。对于这种疯狂无理的进攻，如不立即予以阻击，中国人民势将重受到同于日寇的侵略蹂躏，因此大会一致决议号召全盟盟员，在您和中国共产党的领导下，以“抗美援朝保家卫国”为我们当前的中心政治任务，以行动来证实我们在联合宣言中所作的誓词。加速增加我国国防力量，切实支援正在朝鲜所进行着的伟大战斗，巩固扩大我们已获得的伟大胜利。为了扩大我们的抗美援朝保家卫国力量，我们还一致决议了巩固与发展我们中国民主同盟组织的决定，号召全体盟员，在您和中国共产党的领导下，来巩固与扩大我们的人民民主统一战线，和全世界和平民主的反侵略战线。”
