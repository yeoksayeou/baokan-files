Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Prague: On November 28th, Boukagal, the former Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), reported at the WFDY Council meeting in Vienna on the WFDY delegation's trip to China, stating: "Never in the history of our alliance or any other international organization has such a large delegation been formed. This action by the WFDY is to pay tribute to the achievements and victories of the Chinese people and to assure them that youth around the world stand in solidarity with them in their struggle against the US aggression in Taiwan and Korea, and in their grand work of building a new China."

Boukagal continued: "The construction of the new China has achieved great success, and the Chinese people have united around the Central Government and the people's leader, Mao Zedong. Therefore, the Chinese people and youth believe that the People's Republic of China should have a representative to the United Nations Security Council. The Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched on the island of Taiwan absolutely cannot represent the Chinese people. They openly sell out China's national interests and serve the US imperialists, the mortal enemies of the new China. The Second World Peace Congress, in its appeal to the United Nations, based on the proposal of the Chinese delegation, demanded that the Security Council should have a representative from the People's Republic of China. The World Federation of Democratic Youth and various democratic youth organizations should launch a huge campaign to get the UN General Assembly to accept this demand of the Chinese people."

Boukagal pointed out: "China plays a paramount role in the struggle to defend peace. The Chinese people and youth's love for the cause of peace is not only manifested in the 200 million people who have signed the peace declaration, but also in the grand rallies in every Chinese town we visited. Tens of thousands of young people participated in each rally, all declaring their will to defend peace. They firmly expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and declared that if imperialism dares to invade Chinese territory, they will resolutely fight to defeat the invaders."

"The Chinese people and Chinese youth are resolutely assisting the Korean people in their struggle for national independence, in order to prevent the war from being directed towards the Chinese border. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has arrived at the Korean front, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people, and has inflicted very heavy blows on the US aggressor troops. In doing so, they are also defending the sacred cause of peace."

"We welcome the joint declaration of China's democratic parties, which righteously and forcefully condemned the US aggression against Korea, which has seriously threatened China's territorial integrity."

"Now, together with the Second World Peace Congress, we demand: an immediate end to US interference in Taiwan, and the cessation of the invasion of China's territory and territorial waters by US armed forces. We must, together with various democratic youth organizations, launch a large-scale movement in support of Korea, and demand that the Korean issue be resolved in accordance with the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress."

Boukagal finally emphasized: "The celebration of the Day of Struggle against Colonialism on February 21st next year will receive the broadest response among the people. It will call on youth around the world to intensify their actions against the imperialist wars of aggression in Asian countries such as Korea and Vietnam. We are confident that the bright future facing Chinese youth will give new enthusiasm to the youth in capitalist countries and colonial countries, and encourage them to redouble their efforts and continue to fight resolutely against imperialism and for the defense of peace and national independence. The WFDY delegation's visit to China has greatly strengthened the friendship between Chinese youth and the democratic youth of all countries around the world. It will make a new contribution to the struggle to defend peace and the future of the world's youth."

    世界青联理事会议上
    布加拉报告访华印象
    【新华社讯】本社布拉格记者报道：十一月二十八日，世界民主青年联盟前任总书记布加拉在世界民主青联理事会维也纳会议上，报告世界民主青联访华代表团中国之行称：在我们的联盟或任何其他国际组织的历史上，从来不曾组成过这样大的代表团。世界民主青联这一行动，乃是对中国人民的成就和胜利表示敬意，并向他们保证，在他们反对美国侵略台湾和朝鲜的斗争中，在他们建设新中国的宏大工作中，全世界青年都在声援他们。
    布加拉继称：新中国的建设已获得了伟大的成就，中国人民已团结在中央政府及人民领袖毛泽东的周围。因此，中国人民和青年认为中华人民共和国应有代表出席联合国安全理事会。盘踞在台湾岛上的蒋介石集团已绝对不能代表中国人民，他们公开地出卖中国的民族利益，为新中国的死敌美帝国主义者服务。第二届世界保卫和平大会在致联合国组织的呼吁书中，就根据中国代表团的提议，要求安全理事会应有中华人民共和国的代表参加。世界民主青年联盟和各民主青年组织应发起一个巨大的运动，以使联合国大会接受中国人民的这个要求。
    布加拉指出：在保卫和平的斗争中，中国起着头等重要的作用。中国人民和青年对于和平事业的热爱，不仅仅表现在两万万人已在和平宣言上签了名，而且表现在我们访问过的每一个中国城镇的盛大集会上。每一次集会都有数万青年参加，他们全体声明他们保卫和平的意志。他们坚决表示解放台湾西藏，并且宣布如果帝国主义敢于侵犯中国领土，他们便要坚决作战打败侵略者。
    中国人民和中国青年正坚决地援助朝鲜人民争取民族独立，以制止战争引向中国边疆。中国人民志愿部队已到达朝鲜前线，正与朝鲜人民并肩战斗，给予了美国侵略军以非常沉重的打击。他们这样作也就是在保卫神圣的和平事业。
    我们欢迎中国各民主党派的义正词严的联合宣言，该宣言猛烈地斥责了美国的侵略朝鲜，侵略朝鲜已严重地威胁了中国的领土完整。
    现在，我们要和第二届世界保卫和平大会一同要求：立即停止美国的干涉台湾，制止美国武装部队侵犯中国的领土和领海。我们必须与各民主青年组织一同展开大规模的声援朝鲜的运动，并要求根据第二届世界保卫和平大会的决议，解决朝鲜问题。
    布加拉最后着重指出：庆祝明年二月二十一日反对殖民制度斗争日的运动，将在人民中得到最广大的响应，它将号召全世界青年加紧行动以反对在朝鲜、越南等亚洲国家中的帝国主义侵略战争。我们确信：中国青年所面临的光辉的前途，将给资本主义国家及殖民地国家的青年以新的热忱，鼓舞他们加倍努力，顽强地继续进行反对帝国主义与保卫和平和祖国独立的斗争。世青代表团的访问中国大大地加强了中国青年与全世界各国的民主青年间的友谊。它将对于保卫和平与世界青年的未来的斗争有着新的贡献。
