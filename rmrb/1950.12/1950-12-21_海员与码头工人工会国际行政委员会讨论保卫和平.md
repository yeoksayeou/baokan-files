Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th dispatch: The International Administrative Committee of the Seamen and Dockworkers Union (an industrial department of the World Federation of Trade Unions) held a meeting in Warsaw from the 12th to the 17th to discuss reports from various countries on the struggle of port workers and seafarers to defend peace, defend workers' rights, and unify the trade union movement. Thirty-two representatives from sixteen countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, France, Italy, the United States, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark, and Sweden, attended the meeting, representing eighteen trade union organizations. Fresinett, Secretary-General of the International Seamen and Dockworkers Union, reported on the activities of the International Union since July 1949. He detailed the refusal of dockworkers in many countries to unload American arms and their strikes to fight for their rights, and declared: Seamen and dockworkers will never fight against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The International Seamen and Dockworkers Union will be faithful to its fighting traditions and the solidarity of international labor, and will achieve new successes in protecting the interests of seamen and dockworkers and fighting for peace.

    The Chinese representative, Qiu Jin, reported on the struggles of seamen in Asian countries. The US seafarers representative thanked European port workers for refusing to transport US arms in defiance of terror and persecution, and expressed confidence that the resolutions passed by the conference would significantly enhance the work of US seafarers and dockworkers in the struggle for peace.

    The meeting unanimously approved the membership of the Australian, New Zealand, and Brazilian dockworkers unions, the Colombian Maritime Transport Workers Union, and groups such as the San Francisco and Port Cooks Union to the International Seamen and Dockworkers Union, and elected Elliot, General Secretary of the Australian Seamen's Union, as Chairman of the International Seamen and Dockworkers Union. The meeting also adopted a letter to seamen and dockworkers unions around the world, calling for intensified struggles to defend peace and safeguard their own rights.
