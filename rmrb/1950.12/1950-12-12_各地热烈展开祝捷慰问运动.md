    【Our Newspaper Despatch】People across the country are enthusiastically launching celebration and condolence movements. Millions of congratulatory telegrams and letters of sympathy convey the joyous feelings and grateful enthusiasm of the people across the nation to the heroic anti-American warriors on the Korean front lines.
    When the news of the liberation of Pyongyang arrived, people in various places gathered and paraded to celebrate. At the same time, the celebration and condolence movement is also flourishing everywhere.
    At the "Anti-American Aid Korea Celebration Conference" in Dalian, a committee was formed to comfort the soldiers and officers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the front lines, initiating a campaign to collect 100,000 letters of sympathy, 100,000 comfort bags, 100,000 bars of soap, 100,000 towels, and 100,000 boxes of cigarettes. Representatives from all walks of life also guaranteed that through this celebration and troop-comfort movement, the current achievements in anti-American and aid-Korea current affairs education and production, work, and study competitions would be taken to a deeper level, and that vigilance would be maintained against complacency, a desire for quick victory and paralyzing thoughts. The Tianjin Postal Administration and its affiliated branches in the city launched a campaign of one bag and one letter per person. In Ulanhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on the 8th alone, people's organizations received more than 700 comfort bags, more than 540 letters of sympathy, and a batch of condolence money.
    In every celebration meeting and every gathering held during this period, enthusiastic congratulatory telegrams and letters were passed. The congratulatory telegram passed at the celebration meeting held in Zhangjiakou by representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region said: The people of Inner Mongolia are determined to strengthen various practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country, support your victorious advance, and completely eliminate the American aggressors. The women representatives of the 11th district in the capital's suburbs who were holding a women's representative meeting immediately wrote letters of sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army after hearing about the liberation of Pyongyang. The letter said: Although we cannot go to the front in Korea to fight, we can work hard in the rear to produce and ensure the completion of the task of paying public grain to increase national defense strength and support you. Let you wear warmer clothes and eat better on the front lines, and drive the American imperialists out of Korea faster! We wish you victory and more victory!
    Various organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, soldiers, workers, farmers, teachers, students, etc. also sent congratulatory telegrams and wrote letters of sympathy.
    The congratulatory telegram from the East China Military and Political Committee and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee said: "The brilliant victory you have achieved in your heroic struggle gives excitement and encouragement to the working people all over the world and gives a painful blow to American imperialism and its running dogs. The people of East China are resolutely launching a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country, and are determined to be your rear." The Central South Working Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote in its congratulatory letter: Let the war peddlers see the invincible power of the people once again! Let them cry sadly! If they dare to take another risk, they will surely suffer a more thorough defeat. The letter also told the Chinese and Korean patriots: In the past two months, thousands of young workers, farmers, students, and cadres in the Central South region have been frantically involved in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, thousands of young people have actively participated in the rear public security work, and tens of thousands of young people have enthusiastically signed up to join the volunteer army, and recently, a more surging movement to participate in military cadre schools has been launched. The Gansu Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Gansu Provincial Hui Education Promotion Association, representing 1.5 million people of various ethnic minorities, including Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Dongxiang, sent a congratulatory telegram saying: "We in the remote northwest are very excited to hear the good news of the liberation of Pyongyang. We sincerely continue to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups to support you. We hope that you will plant the red flag of victory all over Korea."
    The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army standing on the front line of national defense are particularly excited about this great victory on the Korean front. A soldier named Li Yulin from the garrison battalion of the North China Military Region said in a letter: The good news of the liberation of Pyongyang made me jump up with joy, and I felt unspeakable joy and excitement in my heart! Good comrades, advance bravely! Victory is waving to you, and the people are cheering for you! I believe that in a very short period of time, we will hear the victorious news of the "complete liberation of Korea"!
    The workers guaranteed in their enthusiastic congratulatory letters that they would do a good job in production as a backing. The letter of sympathy from all the workers of the Zhao Guoyou workshop of the Third Machinery Factory of the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration said: "We are very happy that you have won the battle, and we are working harder in production. Each group in our workshop is making production pacts to ensure that tasks are completed on time and exceeded." Liu Maoyou, a well-known labor model from the Far East Electric Glass Factory in Dalian, wrote: "Your victory has inspired us. I want to learn from your spirit of eliminating American bandits to eliminate difficulties in work. I guarantee that all the workers in our workshop will work day and night to produce." Hou Deyuan, a model worker representing the industrial labor models who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in Beijing and a technician at the Long-Distance Main Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said in his congratulatory letter: I hope you can win another beautiful victory and sink the American imperialists into the sea! In order to cooperate with your heroic battles, I and our Beijing telecommunications workers must do a better job in order to repay your selfless spirit! The letter from all the staff and workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "All the staff and workers of our Shijingshan Power Plant congratulate you on this great victory by over fulfilling the state task in November and creating a new record since the establishment of the factory. Now we have all made resolutions to ensure that we stick to our posts under any circumstances, strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, and continue to carry out patriotic production competitions to ensure that the capital does not have a second of power outage."
    The letters of sympathy from the vast rural farmers also proposed various actions to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The farmers of Xiaobeihe District, Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, said in their letter of sympathy: "We have paid our public grain and prepared stretchers, and we will immediately volunteer to go to the front to participate in the war."
    Teachers and students also wrote many enthusiastic letters of sympathy. By the 10th, the teachers and students of the Dalian University of Technology had written more than 1,200 letters. Xie Shenyan, a student of the college, wrote in his letter: "Comrades! You are more dear to me than any of my relatives. You have established great merits for the motherland and the people, and thousands of young people are preparing to follow your glorious path."
    Professor Zhao Zhongyao, an expert in atomic physics who was repeatedly obstructed and persecuted by American imperialism and recently escaped and returned to China, and American students Shen Shanjiong and Zhu Cheng, who recently arrived in Shanghai, said in their letter of sympathy: "We will contribute all our strength to the construction of the motherland and be your backing."

    各地热烈展开祝捷慰问运动
    【本报讯】各地人民热烈展开祝捷慰问运动。千万封祝捷贺电和慰问信，把全国人民的欢乐心情和感激热忱，带给朝鲜前线英勇的抗美战士们。
    当平壤解放消息传来后，各地人民纷纷集会、游行庆祝。与此同时，祝捷慰问运动，也在各地蓬勃展开着。
    旅大市各界“抗美援朝祝捷大会”上，组成了慰劳朝鲜人民军及我志愿部队前线将士委员会，发起募集十万封慰问信、十万只慰问袋、十万条香皂、十万条毛巾、十万盒香烟的慰劳运动。各界代表并保证通过这一祝捷劳军运动把抗美援朝的时事教育和生产、工作、学习竞赛，在已有的成绩上，更加深入一步；并警惕产生轻敌速胜和麻痹思想。天津邮政管理局及所属市内各支局，发起了每人一袋、一信运动。内蒙自治区的乌兰浩特市，八日一天，各人民团体即收到七百多个慰问袋、五百四十余封慰问信及一批慰问金。
    在每一个祝捷会和每一个在这个期间举行的集会中，都有热情的贺电和贺函被通过。内蒙自治区各族各界代表在张家口召开的庆祝大会上通过的贺电中说：内蒙人民决加强抗美援朝保家卫国的各种实际行动，支援你们胜利进军，彻底消灭美国侵略军。首都郊区正在开妇女代表会的十一区妇女代表们，听到平壤解放后，马上给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军写慰问信。信中说：我们虽不能到朝鲜前方打仗，但是我们可以在后方努力生产，保证完成缴纳公粮任务，来增加国防力量，支援你们。让你们在前方穿的更暖，吃的更饱，更快地把美帝赶出朝鲜去！祝你们胜利，再胜利！
    各机关、民主党派、人民团体、战士、工人、农民、教师、学生等也都纷纷发贺电，写慰问信。
    华东军政委员会和中共中央华东局的贺电说：“你们英勇斗争所获得的光辉胜利，给全世界劳动人民以兴奋鼓舞，给美帝国主义及其走狗以惨痛打击。我们华东人民正坚决展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，誓为你们后盾。”青年团中南工委会在祝贺信中写道：让战争贩子们再一次看着人民无敌的力量吧！让他们悲哀的哭泣吧！如果他们胆敢再来一次冒险，一定将会遭到更彻底的失败。信中并告诉中朝志士们说：两个月来中南区千千万万青年工人、农民、学生、干部都狂热地卷入抗美援朝的运动了，上千的青年积极参加了后方公安工作，上万的青年踊跃报名参加了志愿部队，最近更澎湃地展开了参加军事干部学校的运动。甘肃省民族事务委员会甘肃省回族教育促进会代表甘肃回、藏、蒙、维吾尔、哈萨克、东乡等各少数民族一百五十万人民发出贺电说：“我们在遥远的西北听到光复平壤的捷报，非常兴奋。诚恳地继续加强各民族的团结来支援你们。望把胜利的红旗插遍全朝鲜。”
    站在国防前线上的人民解放军指战员们，对朝鲜前线这一伟大胜利，特别感到兴奋。华北军区警备营的一个叫李玉琳的战士，在信中说：平壤解放的喜讯，使我高兴得跳起来，心中有说不出的愉快和兴奋！好战友，勇敢地前进吧！胜利在向你们招手，人民在向你们欢呼！相信很短的期间，就会听到“朝鲜全部解放”的胜利消息！
    工人们在热情的祝贺信中，保证搞好生产，作为后盾。东北机械工业管理局第三机器厂赵国有车工部全体工人的慰问信上说：“你们打了胜仗，我们高兴万分，生产更加起劲了。我们车间的各个小组都在订立生产公约，保证按时完成和超过任务。”旅大远东电业玻璃工厂著名劳动模范刘茂有写信说：“你们的胜利鼓舞了我们。我要学习你们消灭美国强盗的精神，来消灭工作中的困难。我保证我们全车间工人夜以继日地努力生产。”北京市出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的工业劳模代表、邮电部长途总局技术人员侯德原的祝捷信中说：希望你们能再打一个漂亮的胜仗，把美帝打下海去！为了配合你们的英勇的战斗，我和我们北京的电信职工一定要更好地搞好工作，来报答你们的忘我精神！石景山发电厂全体职工的信中说：“我们石景山发电厂全体职工，用十一月份全部超额完成国家任务，创造建厂以来的新纪录，来祝贺你们这次伟大的胜利。现在我们都立下了决心书，保证在任何情况下，坚守工作岗位，严防匪特破坏，并继续开展爱国主义生产竞赛，保证首都不停一秒钟电。”
    来自广大乡村农民们的慰问信中，也同样提出以各种行动来支援中国人民志愿军。辽东省辽阳县小北河区的农民在慰问信中说：“我们已缴完了公粮，又做好了担架，我们马上就要志愿去前方参战。”
    教师、学生们也写了许多热情的慰问信。大连大学工学院师生截至十日，已写了一千二百多封。该学院学生谢慎焉在信中写道：“同志们！你们比我的任何亲人都亲。你们为祖国为人民建立了伟大的功勋，千千万万的青年正在准备踏着你们光荣的道路前进。”
    曾受美帝国主义一再阻挠和迫害而于最近脱险返国、并于最近抵达上海的我国原子物理学专家赵忠尧教授及留美学生沈善炯、朱城等在慰问信上说：“我们将尽我们全部力量，贡献给祖国的建设，做你们的后盾。”
