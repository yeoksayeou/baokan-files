    The Good Daughter of the Korean People
    ——A Visit with Ms. Ahn Seong-hee from Korea
    By our reporters Bai Sheng and Liang Tian
    While the Korean People's Art Troupe was performing Korean folk dances throughout the Soviet Union, the American bandits launched the war of aggression against Korea. The Art Troupe immediately rushed back to the motherland, heading towards the liberated capital of Seoul, and divided the Art Troupe into five teams to move south with the army. Leading the third team in its work with the army was Ahn Seong-hee, the 19-year-old daughter of the famous Korean dancer Choi Seung-hee. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has created every possibility for her to display her talent. Although young, she has already achieved great artistic success. Her performances are not only loved by the broad masses of the Korean people, but also praised by the people of Moscow, Budapest, and our China.
    On December 19th, we met Ahn Seong-hee in Beijing, who had come to our country from the Korean front. During the most intense period of the war, she lost contact with her mother for four months. Today, dressed in the uniform of a Korean People's Army soldier, she very spiritedly told us about her combat life.
    The art troupe led by Ahn Seong-hee, a total of eleven members, followed the victorious advance of the People's Army step by step, traversing the liberated territory of the motherland, and reaching Mokpo, the southernmost tip of the peninsula. They performed programs to encourage combat, such as "Long Sword Dance" and "Short Sword Dance" for the soldiers, and dances such as "Happiness," which depicted the happy life of the northern people, for the southern people who had just gained a happy life. The conditions for performance were arduous. During the day, enemy planes flew around searching for targets to bomb indiscriminately, so they lit candles and performed at night on the grass or in school buildings. They also held discussions with local guerrillas, district and village cadres, and the people, introducing how the northern people were moving from poverty to happiness and carrying out various peaceful constructions. Their work, like the angry guns of the People's Army soldiers, disintegrated the slanders maliciously spread by the American and Li Syngman bandits, and awakened the hearts of the southern people, who had been suppressed and humiliated for many years, to participate in the battle.
    When the American bandits invaded Incheon and Seoul from the sea, they were working in Daejeon. The General Headquarters ordered some of the troops to retreat north in an organized and planned manner, and they also had to move north with the army. She told us how reluctant the People's Army soldiers, who were bravely pursuing and annihilating the enemy on the Nakdong River front, were to go back! She also saw how unwilling the southern people, who had just been allocated land and received the love of the motherland, were to let the People's Army leave them! But finally, they said "goodbye" to each other and temporarily parted ways. Ahn Seong-hee, the 19-year-old dancer, also shouldered a 35-shot automatic rifle and followed the People's Army along the mountainous areas of the Sobaek Mountains, Odae Mountains, and Taebaek Mountains, fighting and marching. Sometimes they had to climb over dense, roadless mountains, and sometimes they trudged along muddy mountain roads in the dark, rainy night. Together with the soldiers, they held hands and formed a line, traversing the difficult paths. The rain soaked their clothes; hunger sometimes made it almost impossible for them to drag their tired legs; the darkness sometimes caused comrades to lose their way; in order to bypass the enemy's main force, or break through the enemy's encirclement, they had to march a hundred li a day, and sometimes they even had to quietly crawl past enemy cars blocking them. When encountering small enemy forces, they rushed up with their guns and annihilated them.
    As they marched north with the People's Army, the elderly and women and children in the villages they passed through took care of them kindly; young people either took guns from them to fight guerrillas, or directly joined their ranks and walked with them. However, of the six members of the Soviet Art Troupe who were walking north with her along the east coast, two unfortunately sacrificed themselves: 21-year-old female singer Ryu Seon-do and young violinist Park Jung-bo. Another female dancer, Lim Jeong-ok, went missing while breaking through the enemy's encirclement in the Taebaek Mountains, and there is still no news of her.
    In mid-November, when Ahn Seong-hee and her comrades reached a village near Yangdeok County north of the 38th parallel, they encountered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. She described the meeting with unparalleled excitement. When they first met the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, everyone was extremely moved. Among the Korean People's Army were soldiers who had previously participated in the Anti-Japanese War in our country. Through them, the two sides eagerly conversed. A soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army told her, "When we were fighting Japan, you shed blood for us. Now that America is bullying you, can we sit idly by? We are brothers!" That evening, the two sides jointly held an entertainment gala. She performed songs and dances at the meeting and sang her best songs for the heroic meeting of the two great armies.
    Ahn Seong-hee, who traveled three thousand li in battle for four months, was not bowed by countless tortures and difficulties, but made her stronger. She told us that she would weave the bravery of the People's Army, the atrocities of the American and Li Syngman bandits, and the great scenes of the Chinese people's resistance to America and aid to Korea that she saw in her four months of combat life into her dances, and enrich her creations with her personal experience. And bring them back to the Korean front to serve the motherland and the people.
    When we said goodbye to her, she wrote "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!" in clear and powerful handwriting on our autograph book.

    朝鲜人民的好女儿
    ——访问自朝鲜来京的安圣姬女士
    本报记者柏生  梁田
    当朝鲜人民访苏艺文团正在苏联各地演出朝鲜民族歌舞的时候，美国强盗挑起了侵朝战争。访苏艺文团立即奔返祖国，向解放了的首都汉城进发，并将艺文团分成五队随军南下。率领第三小队随军工作的是朝鲜名舞蹈家崔承喜的十九岁的女儿安圣姬。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为她创造了一切发挥她的天才的可能性。她年纪虽然幼小，却已有了极高的艺术成就。她的演出，不仅为广大的朝鲜人民所热爱，而且也获得莫斯科、布达佩斯以及我们中国的人民的赞美。
    十二月十九日，我们在北京会到了自朝鲜前线来到我国的安圣姬。在战争最紧张的时候，她曾与她母亲失掉联系达四个月，今天，她穿着朝鲜人民军战士的服装非常有精神地向我们讲述她的战斗生活。
    安圣姬领导的这一队艺文团，一共十一位团员，她们步步随着人民军的胜利进军走遍解放了的祖国疆土，一直到达了半岛最南端的木浦。她们向战士们演出“长剑舞”“短剑舞”一些鼓舞战斗的节目，向刚刚获得幸福生活的南部人民演出描写北部人民美满生活的“幸福”等舞蹈。演出的条件是艰苦的。白天敌机到处飞寻着滥炸的目标，她们便燃上蜡烛在夜晚的草地上或校舍内表演。她们还与当地的游击战士、区村干部和人民座谈，向他们介绍北部人民怎样从贫困走向幸福，怎样进行着各种各样的和平建设。她们的工作和人民军战士愤怒的枪炮一样，瓦解那些由美李匪徒们恶意散播的诽谤，并唤醒南部人民多少年来被压抑被侮辱的心去参加战斗。
    美国强盗自海上进犯仁川、汉城时，她们正在大田工作。总司令部命令部分军队向北作有组织有计划的撤退，她们也要随军北上。她告诉我们，她目睹那些在洛东江前线勇猛追歼敌人的人民军战士们多么不愿意往回走！她也看到了刚刚分得土地获得了祖国爱抚的南部人民多么不愿意人民军离开他们！但是终于他们互相作了“再见”的誓语而暂时地分别了。安圣姬，十九岁的舞蹈家，也肩起三十五发的自动步枪，随着人民军沿着小白山、五台山和太白山的山区一边战斗一边行军。她们有时要爬过森林茂密的没有道路的大山，有时于漆黑的夜里在下雨的泥泞的山路上跋涉着。她们和战士们一起，一只手拉一只手结成一条线穿行在难行的小径上。雨，湿透了衣服；饥饿，有时使她们几乎拖不动那两条疲累的腿；黑夜，有时会使同志们迷失了方向；为了绕过敌人的主力，或冲过敌人的包围，她们不得不一天行军一百里，有时还需要静悄悄地从敌人封锁他们的汽车旁边爬了过去。在遭遇到敌人的小兵力时，她们就抱着枪冲上去，将他们歼灭。
    她们随着人民军往北行军，在所经过的村庄中，老年人和妇孺亲切地照顾着他们；年青人或则向他们领了枪枝去打游击，或则直接参加他们的队伍一起走。但是顺着东海岸和她一起随军北走的访苏艺文团的六个团员，却不幸有两位牺牲了，他们是二十一岁的女歌唱家柳善道和青年提琴家朴重宝，另一位女舞蹈家林贞玉则是在太白山区冲出敌人包围时失踪了，至今还没有消息。
    十一月中旬，当安圣姬和她的战友到达三八线以北阳德县附近的一个村庄时，他们遇到了我国人民志愿军。她以无比的兴奋向我们叙述了这一次会师的经过。她们最初遇见我国人民志愿军时，大家都感动极了。在朝鲜人民军当中有从前在我国参加过抗日战争的战士，通过他们，两下里热烈地攀谈起来。我国人民志愿军的一位战士告诉她说：“打日本时，你们为我们流了血，美国来欺侮你们了，我们能坐视吗？我们是兄弟啊！”当晚，两下里便联合开了娱乐晚会，她在这个会上表演了歌舞，并为两支大军的英雄的会师唱出她的最好的歌。
    安圣姬，四个月中在战斗中行进了三千里，无数的折磨与困难都没有使她低头，而且使她更为坚强了。她告诉我们，她要把这四个月战斗生活中所见到的人民军的勇敢、美李匪徒的暴行，以及我国人民抗美援朝的伟大的情景，交织在她的舞蹈里，用亲身的体验来丰富她的创作。并将它们带回朝鲜前线，为祖国和人民服务。
    当我们与她告别时，她在我们的签名簿上用清楚而有力的笔迹，写下了“中朝人民团结万岁！”
