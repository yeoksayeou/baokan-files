    Miao People Must Unite with Brother Nationalities to Defend Our Happy Times!
    Wu Diping
    We Miao people, like other nationalities, have our own history. However, from the collapse of the Jiuli Sanmiao regime in the era of Emperor Yao and Shun until the eve of liberation, we were completely in a position of oppression and exploitation for these four to five thousand long years, unable to turn over or lift our heads, living the life of slaves and cattle.

    The feudal dynasties of the past were extremely cruel in their rule and persecution of us. They called us "uncivilized people" and the places where we lived "Miao and Man lands that do not submit to the king's rule." They barbarously slaughtered millions of our compatriots, burned our vast villages, and tried every possible means to divide us, separating us into "raw Miao," "cooked Miao," "flowery Miao," "blue Miao," etc., attempting to provoke discord and create internal strife among the nationalities for their own benefit.
    After the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China appeared, but Chiang Kai-shek did not allow us to be called "Miao Nationality," "Miao People," or "Miao Family," but wanted to call us "border people" or "border compatriots." If the word "Miao" had to be used, it had to be followed by the suffix "zi," called "Miaozi," to show insult. He said that there were no other nationalities in China besides the Han nationality, only some "branches." He established "assimilation committees" in some parts of Guizhou, specializing in the work of assimilating our minority nationalities in Guizhou. He forbade us to use our own language, he forbade us to practice our own customs, he did not allow us to wear our own national costumes. When Miao women walked on the streets, they would be surrounded, their hair cut off, and their clothes torn. Some people even took the opportunity of "reforming clothing" to go to the countryside and act wildly, extorting money, raping, and plundering. Chiang Kai-shek vainly attempted to eliminate everything we had, and he shamelessly called this "Great Harmony" and "evolution." In addition, they imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, and forced us to provide labor and grain, making it impossible for us to live.

    However, we Miao people, with a glorious tradition of struggle, have never bent our knees or lowered our heads before any reactionary ruler. For our own liberation, we have launched countless revolutionary struggles, which were earth-shattering and made the rulers tremble with fear.
    "The greater the pressure, the greater the reaction." The Qing government's cruel exploitation of us aroused a surge of resistance. In 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng), simultaneously with the Taiping Rebellion, the Miao leader Zhang Xiumei and others in Guizhou raised the banner of anti-Qing uprising in the area of present-day Taijiang and Leishan. For a time, the momentum was enormous, attacking and conquering everything, defeating the Qing army and occupying vast areas. The struggle persisted for more than ten years. Although it was finally defeated due to the betrayal of Miao traitors and the cruel suppression of the rulers, sacrificing hundreds of thousands of compatriots, the names of heroes such as Zhang Xiumei, Bao Dadu, and Nie Gonggan are well-known to women and children. Even today, every Miao compatriot deeply commemorates their heroic deeds, and passionate historical songs are circulating in the vast Miao areas, encouraging us to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and fight for our own happiness.

    During the era of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in western Hunan, the Miao and Han masses (mainly Miao people) could not bear the exploitation of the Chiang bandits and raised the slogans of "abolishing the garrison and resisting rent" and "overthrowing Chiang" to struggle.

    In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek, under the pretext of resisting Japan, wantonly forced us to provide labor and grain, making it impossible for us to continue our lives. Thus, the "Eastern Guizhou Incident" broke out in the Taijiang, Leishan, and Jianhe areas, with slogans of "Resisting Grain and Taxes" and "Down with Corrupt Officials" plastered everywhere. This incident shook the entire Guizhou, causing Wu Dingchang, who was ruling Guizhou at the time, to panic. He quickly established a "bandit suppression headquarters," personally serving as the commander-in-chief, and successively commanded several of his "security regiments" to suppress us, but they were defeated and fled in disgrace. Unable to do anything, he requested the dispatch of the 195th Division of the "Central Army" to help him suppress the rebellion, and adopted the inhumane policy of "burning and killing," burning every village they entered and killing everyone they saw. This is a fact that I saw with my own eyes. At that time, I was just a teenager. While my fathers and brothers were engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in nearby villages, my mother and I, along with many relatives and friends, hid in a cave opposite the village. We hoped and prayed that we could achieve victory. Unfortunately, however, at dawn one day, after a period of intense gunfire, fires broke out around the village, and the fire grew stronger and stronger. We knew that the enemy had already entered. "Mom! My God..." Cries of pain and curses were heard everywhere. After the beasts burned the village, they went to the outside of the village to search for things. They dragged away our cattle and horses, carried away our rice and property, and even dragged all the elderly, weak women, and ignorant children to their "township offices," searching every thread and fiber, even the wigs of the women, leaving nothing behind, only a scene of rubble that was unbearable to witness. An old man in our village, in his fifties or sixties, believed that all human beings had humanity and would not arbitrarily kill innocent people. He carried a thrush cage in his hand and went to the hillside to see how his family was doing. However, the enemy were inhuman beasts. They saw him from afar and concentrated several machine guns to fire at him. He fell down. They even cut off his head and demanded a huge sum from his family to redeem the head. This is just one scene of thousands of tragedies! Chiang Kai-shek shouted all day long about preferential treatment for "border people." This is the "preferential treatment" he gave us!

    This enemy, our compatriots are very clear about it. We have not forgotten another foreign enemy - American and British imperialism.

    As early as the Qing Dynasty, when our national hero Zhang Xiumei merged with the great current of the Taiping Rebellion, this Miao-Han allied army was brave and invincible, and captured many places like a hot knife through butter. Later, the Qing government colluded with American and British imperialism to form a "foreign gun team" to attack all the revolutionary armies. Under the superiority of the enemy's weapons and manpower, our revolution was bloodily suppressed. The "foreign guns," which were regarded as gods at the time, shot dead tens of thousands of our compatriots. From that time on, they have owed us a debt of blood, which has not yet been repaid.

    Later, during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, American imperialism used the church to enter our area, establishing schools, hospitals, and churches, helping to create writing, and giving small favors in an attempt to buy people's hearts. It wanted us to only know how to worship "God" every day, teaching us to forget our own nationality. It wanted to train us into docile lambs who did not know how to struggle for the rulers. Although it did not achieve its wish, this kind of conspiracy was even more powerful than tangible airplanes and cannons.

    We will never forget it. We still clearly remember the situation when the United States built an airport in eastern Guizhou in 1944. At that time, it was the harsh winter, and the United States dragged tens of thousands of our compatriots to Huangping to build an airport. At first, they said that they would let you go back to celebrate the New Year before your New Year. However, when the New Year came, it did not allow us to go back. People thought that even crows had to return to their nests on the thirtieth night! Let alone people? So, those who lived close to home secretly ran away. Unfortunately, some people were discovered by them, caught back and beaten to death alive, which they called "punishing one to warn a hundred." Many people were also beaten with sticks or even died because they were not careful at work. Our compatriots, who had been exploited for a long time, were generally very poor. When they were at home, they would light a big fire and surround the stove to spend the night. In the deep mountains and valleys, there was not much wind, and with a fire, it was still possible to barely survive even if it was cold. But when they came to the dam (because there are many mountains and few flat areas there, so the flat areas are called dams), they were thinly dressed, the wind was strong, there was no fire, and they had to work under the coercion of their bayonets and sticks. Many people froze to death because they could not stand the cold. When they saw these frozen corpses, they treated them like dead dogs, ordering "Quick, throw him into the river to avoid hindering hygiene." According to my memory at the time, in Taijiang and its neighboring counties alone, 28 people died in this way.

    In history, we have lived hard under the heavy persecution of domestic feudal rulers and foreign imperialists. Today, the People's Republic of China has been established and consolidated. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we have shattered the ethnic shackles of thousands of years and gained liberation. For the first time, we appear on the historical stage of China as masters, controlling our own destiny, and working together with all brother nationalities on an equal footing to build our loving national family and jointly create our happy life. However, American imperialism does not want us to live this united and friendly happy life, and it is taking action to destroy it. It vainly attempts to invade our motherland's mainland and enslave the people of all ethnic groups in China again.

    We Miao people have always loved our motherland very much. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we organized a "Miao People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army" in the Hunan-Guizhou border area and asked the then Chiang government to allow us to go to the front to resist the Japanese invaders and defend the motherland. Although our just demands were mercilessly suppressed by the Chiang government and we were disarmed, so that our wishes at that time could not be realized; but we did not therefore become indifferent to the motherland. We still enthusiastically joined the army and paid grain, dedicating everything we had for the fate of the motherland. Although "we became soldiers, we provided grain, but others enjoyed the benefits, and we had no share, and we were not allowed to ask about national affairs," we knew that this was only the crime of a few reactionary rulers, so we did not complain about the motherland because of this. Now, under the correct ethnic policy of Chairman Mao, we have understood that the saying "stones cannot be made into pillows, and Han people cannot be made into friends" is wrong. Today, when the people have achieved victory and "the Miao family has come to the fore," we Miao people will unite with all ethnic groups in China to fight for the victory over American imperialism.

    苗族人民要和兄弟民族团结起来，保卫我们的幸福时光！
    吴涤平
    我们苗族也和其他民族一样，自己有自己的历史。但是，自唐虞时代的九黎三苗政权崩溃时起，以迄于解放前夕，在这四五千年的漫长岁月中，我们完全处在被压迫与受剥削的地位，翻不过身，抬不起头，一直过着奴隶牛马的生活。
    历代封建王朝对于我们的统治与迫害是非常残酷的。他们说我们是“化外之民”，把我们住的地方叫做“不服王化的苗蛮之邦”。他们野蛮地屠杀我们数以千百万计的同胞，焚毁我们广大的村寨，千方百计地分化我们，把我们分成“生苗”、“熟苗”、“花苗”、“青苗”……等等，企图挑拨离间，制造民族内部的纷争，他们好坐收渔利。
    满清被推翻以后，民国出现了，可是，蒋介石不准称我们为“苗族”“苗民”或“苗家”，而要称为“边民”或“边胞”，假使要带“苗”字，后面就得跟上个“子”字，称为“苗子”，以示侮辱。他说中国除了汉族以外，并没有别的民族，有的只是一些“宗支”。他在贵州某些地方成立了“同化委员会”，专门做同化我们贵州少数民族的工作。他不准我们使用我们自己的语文，他不准我们行我们自己的风俗习惯，他不让我们穿我们自己民族的服装，当我们苗族妇女在街上走过的时候，就会被包围起来，剪掉头发，撕破衣服。有的人甚至借“改装”为名，下乡去胡作非为，勒索敲诈，奸淫掳掠。蒋介石妄图消灭我们所有的一切，他反而无耻地把此说成“大同”与“进化”。此外，他们更横征暴敛，拉丁征粮，使得我们无法生活。
    但是，我们有着光荣斗争传统的苗族人民，不曾在任何反动统治者的面前屈过膝，低过头，为了自己的解放，我们曾史不绝书地掀起无数次的革命斗争，轰轰烈烈，使统治者们心惊胆寒。
    “压力越大，反应越大”，满清政府对于我们的残酷压榨，激起了我们反抗的怒潮。一八五四年（咸丰四年）与太平天国革命的同时，贵州的苗族领袖张秀眉等在现在的台江、雷山一带竖起了反清的义旗，一时声势浩大，攻无不克，战无不胜，把清军打得落花流水，占领了广大的地区，斗争一直坚持了十几年。最后虽然由于内部苗奸的出卖和统治者的残酷镇压而失败了，牺牲掉几十万同胞；但是张秀眉、包大肚、乜弓敢这些英雄的名字，已经是妇孺皆知，直到今天每个苗胞的心里还深深地纪念着他们的英雄行为，激昂慷慨的史歌在广大的苗区中流传着，鼓舞我们踏着先烈的血迹为自己的幸福而斗争。
    到了蒋介石统治的时代，抗日战争的初期，在湘西，苗汉群众（主要是苗民）因为受不了蒋匪的剥削，提出了“废屯抗租”“倒蒋”的口号起来斗争。
    一九四三年蒋介石以抗日为借口，大肆向我们拉丁，苛派粮款，使我们的生活无法继续维持下去了，于是在台江、雷山、剑河一带爆发了“黔东事变”，四处贴满了“抗粮抗款”“打倒贪官污吏”的标语。这一事变震撼了整个贵州，使得当时统治贵州的吴鼎昌手忙脚乱起来，连忙成立了“剿匪总指挥部”，自己亲任总指挥，先后指挥他的几个“保安团”去清剿我们，结果被我们打得大败而逃。没有办法，又请调了“中央军”一九五师去帮他进剿，并且采用了灭绝人性的“烧杀”政策，攻进一村烧一村，看见一个杀一个。这是我亲眼看到的事实。那时我还是一个十几岁的小孩子。当父兄们正在附近寨子与敌人进行着激烈战斗的时候，我同妈妈和很多亲友躲在寨子对面的山洞里。我们盼望着，祈祷着我们能够取得胜利。然而不幸得很，在一天的黎明时分，一度紧密的枪声之后，寨子的四周燃起火了，火势越来越烈，我们知道敌人已经攻进去了。“妈呀！我的天……”四处发出了惨痛的哭声和诅咒声。野兽们把村子烧了以后，就到村外四周去搜找东西，他们拉走了我们的牛马，抬去了我们的稻谷、财物，连老弱的妇女和不知事的小孩都通通拉到他们的“乡公所”里去，一丝一线，甚至于妇女们的假发都搜得一干二净，一毫不留，留下的只是一片目不忍睹的瓦砾场。我们寨子里的一个五六十岁的老头，他认为凡人都是有人性的，不会随便杀害无辜的人民。他手里提着一个画眉笼，到坡上去，想看看家里人到底怎么样了。但是，敌人却是无人性的野兽，他们远远的看见了他，就集中几挺机枪向他开火，他倒下去了。他们还把他的头割下来，叫他的家属以巨款去赎取这个脑袋。这还只是千万个惨剧中的一幕！蒋介石成天嚷着优待“边民”，这就是他所给予我们的“优待”呀！
    这个敌人，我们的同胞是认识得非常清楚的；还有一个外来的敌人——美英帝国主义——我们也没有忘记它。
    早在满清时代，我们的民族英雄张秀眉与太平天国革命的巨流汇合在一起的时候，这支苗汉联军是英勇无敌的，势如破竹地攻占了很多地方。后来满清政府勾结了美英帝国主义，组成“洋枪队”向所有的革命军进击。在敌人武器人力多方面的优势下，我们的革命被血洗了，当时视之如神的“洋枪”射死了我们成千累万的同胞。从那个时候起，它们就已欠下了我们一笔血的债务，一直还没偿还。
    以后，清光绪年间，美帝利用教会，进入了我们的区域，设学校，立医院，建教堂，帮助创造文字，行点小恩小惠，企图收买人心。它要我们天天只知道去奉崇“上帝”，教我们忘掉自己的民族，它要替统治者把我们训练成不知斗争的服服贴贴的羔羊。它虽然并没有达到自己的意愿，但这种阴谋暗算，比起有形的飞机大炮却还要来得厉害。
    我们是永远不会健忘的，我们还清楚地记得一九四四年美国在黔东修建飞机场时的情形。那时候正是酷寒的冬日，美国拉我们成千成万的同胞到黄平去修飞机场。最初他们说，在你们过年之前就让你们回去过年。但是，年节到了，它不许我们回去，人们想，到了三十晚，乌鸦都得归巢呀！何况是人？于是，离家近的，就偷偷地逃跑了。不幸，有些人被他们发现了，捉回来活活打死，他们称之为“惩一儆百”。有不少人因为工作时不留心，也遭受了棍棒毒打，甚至于死。我们的同胞，在长时期的被剥削下，一般都非常贫穷，在家的时候，冷了就发起大火围炉过夜，在深山穷谷中，没有多大的风，有了火再冷也还可以勉强过得去。但是到了坝子（因为我们那里山多平地少，所以把平的地方都称为坝子）上来，衣单被薄风又大，火也没有，并且还要在他们的刺刀、棍棒威逼之下工作着，很多人就因为挨不住冷而活生生的给冻死了。他们看见了这冻僵的尸体，视同一只死狗，命令“快点把他丢到河里，以免有碍卫生”。据我当时的记忆，仅台江及其邻近数县就这样死了二十八人。
    在历史上，我们就是这样在国内封建统治者和国外帝国主义者的重重迫害下艰苦地过下来的。今天，中华人民共和国建立与巩固了，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，我们打碎了数千年来的民族镣铐而获得解放，第一次以主人翁的姿态出现在中国的历史舞台上，自己掌握自己的命运，在平等的地位上与各兄弟民族齐力来建设我们友爱的民族大家庭，共同创造我们的美满生活。但是，美帝国主义不愿意我们过这团结友爱的幸福生活，它动手来破坏了。它妄想侵入我们祖国的大陆，再来奴役中华各族的人民。
    我们苗族人民向来是非常热爱祖国的。在抗日战争时期，我们曾经在湘黔边区组织起一支“苗民抗日自卫军”，向当时的蒋政府要求准予到前方去抗击日寇，保卫祖国。虽然我们的正义要求遭到了蒋政府无情的打击，并被解除了武装，致使我们当时的愿望不能达到；但我们并不因此而对祖国有所冷淡，我们依然一样地踊跃参军、缴粮，为了祖国的命运奉献出我们所有的一切。虽然“我们当了兵，我们出了粮，而别人在享福，没有我们的份，国家的事，不许我们问”，但我们知道这只是少数反动统治者的罪恶，所以我们也并不因此而对祖国发怨言。现在，我们在毛主席的正确民族政策教导下，已经懂得“石头作不得枕头，汉人作不得朋友”的话是不对的。在人民已取得了胜利，“苗家出了头”的今天，我们苗族人民将和中华各民族团结在一起，为了战胜美帝国主义而斗争。
