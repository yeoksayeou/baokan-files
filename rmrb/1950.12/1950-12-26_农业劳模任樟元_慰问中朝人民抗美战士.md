    Agricultural Model Worker Ren Zhangyuan
    Sends Condolences to Chinese and Korean People's Anti-American Fighters
    [This News Report] Ren Zhangyuan, an agricultural labor model from East China who attended the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, wrote a letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. The letter said: "You are advancing victoriously on the front lines, bravely fighting the enemy, and giving them no chance to catch their breath. We in the rear will actively engage in production to support you. Although American imperialism is still quite ferocious now, we will certainly defeat it. Victory will surely belong to our people! Glorious soldiers, march forward bravely! We peasant brothers will enthusiastically support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, actively complete land reform, thoroughly eliminate feudal forces, resolutely eliminate bandits and special agents, consolidate national defense, and defend the fruits of victory, serving as your strong backing."
