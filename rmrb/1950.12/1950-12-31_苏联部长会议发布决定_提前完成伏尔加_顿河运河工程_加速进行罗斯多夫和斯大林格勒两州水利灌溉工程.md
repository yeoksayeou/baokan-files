Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: According to TASS, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued a decision on the 28th to complete the Volga-Don Canal project two years ahead of schedule and accelerate irrigation projects in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions. The decision stated that the Volga-Don Canal is of great significance to the Soviet national economy, as it will connect the White Sea, Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Azov Sea in the European part of the Soviet Union, forming a single shipping system. The water conservancy projects on the canal and its branches will irrigate 750,000 hectares of land and supply water from the Don River to 2 million hectares of semi-desert and arid areas. This massive project was suspended due to the war, but the government passed a decision three years ago to resume the canal's construction. Given that the construction project is now progressing smoothly and the Volga-Don Canal Engineering Administration possesses powerful excavators, construction machinery, and transportation equipment, it has now been decided to shorten the originally planned construction period by two years.

The decision stipulates that in 1951, the 101-kilometer canal connecting the Volga River and the Don River from Stalingrad to the town of Kalach-na-Donu, as well as 13 locks, 3 dams, pumping stations, and docks on the river, will be completed; a reservoir with a capacity of 12.6 billion cubic meters will be built near the village of Tsimlyanskaya on the Don River, and a 160,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power station will be built on the dam. This canal will be open to navigation in 1952, and the hydroelectric power station will also begin generating electricity at the same time.

The decision also stipulates that the construction of irrigation systems to irrigate 750,000 hectares of land in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions and supply water to 2 million hectares of land from the Don River will be completed from 1951 to 1956. To achieve this goal, the 190-kilometer Don Main Canal and seven branch canals with a total length of 568 kilometers will be built. 140 pumping stations and power transmission lines directly to the pumping stations will be built on these canals. Wheat and cotton will be developed first in the canal irrigation area, and electrification of cultivation will be implemented.

The Soviet Council of Ministers ordered the Soviet Ministry of Water Conservancy to be responsible for the canal's surveying, research, and design work; ordered the Volga-Don Canal Engineering Administration to be responsible for the canal and pumping stations, reservoirs, and dams on the canal. The Soviet Council of Ministers also ordered the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Cotton Growing, and the Ministry of State Farms to be responsible for the implementation of irrigation and water supply plans and the widespread electrification of agriculture, and to be responsible for the surveying, design, and construction of hydropower projects related to water supply projects; ordered the Soviet Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of State Farms to be responsible for planting forest shelterbelts in the irrigated areas.

    苏联部长会议发布决定
    提前完成伏尔加——顿河运河工程
    加速进行罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州水利灌溉工程
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议于二十八日发布提前两年完成伏尔加河——顿河运河的工程，及加速进行罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州的水利灌溉工程的决定。决定称：伏尔加河——顿河运河对苏联国民经济具有重大的意义，它将把在苏联欧洲部分的白海、波罗的海、里海、黑海和亚速海都联系起来，构成一个单一的航运系统。运河及其分支上的水利工程，将灌溉七十五万公顷土地，并将以顿河水源供应两百万公顷的半沙漠和干旱地区。这一巨大工程曾因战争中止，但在三年前政府即通过决定恢复运河的修建工程。鉴于该项建筑工程现正顺利进行，而且伏尔加河——顿河运河工程管理处已拥有强力的掘凿机、建筑机器和交通工具，现在决定缩短预定的修筑期限两年。
    决定规定在一九五一年完成从斯大林格勒城到顿河傍卡拉奇镇的连接伏尔加河与顿河的长达一○一公里的运河，以及河上的十三道水闸、三道堤坝、抽水工厂和码头等工程；在顿河的齐姆良斯卡雅村附近建造一个容水一百二十六亿立方公尺的蓄水池，并在拦水坝上建立一座发电十六万千瓦的水力发电站。这一运河将在一九五二年通航，水电站亦将在同时开始发电。
    决定并规定：在一九五一——一九五六年中完成在罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州灌溉七十五万公顷土地，和以顿河水源向两百万公顷土地供水的灌溉系统的修建工程。为了完成这一目标，将修建长一百九十公里的顿河主干运河，以及共长五百六十八公里的七条运河分支。在这些运河上将修建一百四十个抽水站以及直达抽水站的输电线路。在运河灌溉区将首先发展小麦及棉花的种植，并实行耕作的电气化。
    苏联部长会议命令苏联水力工程处负责进行运河的勘察、研究与设计工程；命令伏尔加河——顿河运河工程管理处负责运河及运河上的抽水站、蓄水池和堤坝等工程。苏联部长会议并命令苏联农业部、植棉部及国营农场部负责执行灌溉和供水计划及实行农业中的广泛电气化的工作，并负责与供水工程有关的水电工程的勘察、设计与建筑工作，命令苏联林业部、农业部和国营农场部负责在灌溉区种植森林防护带的工作。(附图片）
