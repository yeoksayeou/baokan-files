    Two Roads for the American Invaders in Korea:
    The upper picture shows American soldiers captured by the Chinese and Korean People's forces during the fighting in the Wenkai area. They have been treated leniently and will be able to return home and reunite with their families in the future. The lower picture shows a large number of American officers and soldiers killed by our Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They have needlessly lost their lives for the Wall Street bosses.

    上图为温开一带作战中被中朝人民部队生俘的美军，他们受到了宽待，将来可以回家和他们的亲人团聚；下图为被我人民志愿军击毙的大批美军官兵，他们无谓地为华尔街老板丧了命。	随中国人民志愿部队记者赵志诚·张进摄
