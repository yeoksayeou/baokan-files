		Warsaw Correspondence
	
	The Great Unity of the People of the World
	Cao Ming, Representative to the Second World Peace Congress from China
	
	Representatives from eighty-one countries, from every corner of the globe, expressed the ardent hopes of hundreds of millions of people for peace and their conviction in defending world peace with loud and firm voices at the Second World Peace Congress. These representatives have their own political views and religious beliefs; but for the sake of peace, everyone is united, tightly united!
	
	While the wounds inflicted on Warsaw by Hitler's fascism had not yet fully healed, and the painful traces were still vivid, we heard the angry accusations of the Korean representatives. Who destroyed the culture, historical sites, and buildings accumulated by the Korean people for generations, turning them into rubble and ashes? Who is creating the terrible death toll in Korea, the terrible situation of a large number of widows and orphans? If we do not act quickly to stop it, the flames of a third world war may be ignited throughout Asia. The Chinese representatives told the Congress that the Chinese people had just stood up and started peaceful production and construction, but were immediately subjected to serious war threats, so they were resolutely assisting Korea in resisting American aggression. Representatives from many countries unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialists' barbaric aggression against Korea, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S.-led aggressor troops in Korea. From the Congress, one could see how concerned the people of all countries are about the situation in Asia!
	
	Greece, Finland, and Pakistan stated the facts of imperialism infringing upon their sovereignty, launching civil wars, causing people to bleed and sacrifice, and suffering from unemployment and poverty in those countries. The Pakistani representative declared loudly: Every Pakistani people is unwilling to be a tool for imperialism. This precisely illustrates the ideas of the people in countries divided or enslaved by imperialism.
	
	Mr. Robertson's righteous song, breaking through oppression and obstruction, resounded throughout the Congress and around the world through a recording. "Which field, which building in America does not have the blood and sweat of black people? But what they get is an inhuman life and slave treatment..." "Yes, who has the right to stop us from living like a human being? Who has the right to create poverty and misfortune for a race, destroying and suppressing their wisdom, keeping their culture stagnant for centuries? Who is preparing atomic and bacteriological weapons for mass murder and the extermination of mankind?" We heard the British Cardinal Johnson also utter a cry of injustice: What kind of civilization is it to harm others for aggression?
	
	If crimes are called civilization, it is the imperialists and their lackeys who deliberately revise the world's dictionary. The Polish representative said sadly: "Although we are repairing and rebuilding every day, the traces of the wounds stimulate the hatred in our hearts every moment. The U.S. imperialists have now completely inherited Hitler's mantle and are openly slaughtering and destroying Korea. We heard the cries of the Korean people: The Korean people will never forget their hatred for the U.S. imperialists. We understand revenge! A Korean mother left her son, who was killed by bombing, in the river and joined the guerrillas. Is there only one such mother?"
	
	The blood debts owed by the U.S. imperialism cannot be recorded even in the thickest book in the world. It is recorded in the hearts of every enslaved and violated people. It is condemned by all good people in the world.
	
	Yes, people have come to war-torn Warsaw to declare their desire for peace and their determination to defend peace, and to denounce the crimes of imperialism, after the lessons of death and suffering, and after the struggle of conscience. Warsaw is not a scenic spot. Why have hundreds and thousands of men, women, old people, and young adults of different political views, different religious beliefs, and different professions put aside their busy duties to come here?
	
	For world peace, these gentlemen and ladies have come here. For the common belief of defending peace, they have understood and trusted each other. Some past misunderstandings have disappeared in the exchange of justice and conscience. We are all good people, we all have clear minds, people who can discern the direction of history, we are all people who have struggled out of disasters, and no strange theory or any force can divide us anymore. Everyone unanimously responded to Chairman Curie's call, discussed specific methods, and established various organizations to effectively stop aggression.
	
	Can the united will of hundreds of millions of people not defeat a small group of brutal imperialists? – The ghost of Hitler in the underworld can answer this question.
	
	Now our scope of unity is wider than during World War II; our strength is greater. No one doubts the saying that unity is strength.
	
	The Second World Peace Congress was a victory, and the good people of the world who love peace were victorious. We are united as one. Countless handshakes, hugs, kisses, and conversations among representatives of different races, creeds, and professions have increased the closeness of our souls. There is no racial prejudice, no national hatred, but only mutual trust between the people of all countries. This mutual trust among the people has defeated the vicious ideas of the imperialists who spread division among mankind. The people have united and are fighting more heroically for lasting world peace. Let the imperialists tremble before us! (Evening of the closing of the Congress, November 22, 1950.)

### 全世界人民的大团结

    全世界人民的大团结
    出席二届世界和大中国代表  草明
    来自地球上每一个角落的八十一个国家的代表，用宏亮的坚定的声音，在第二届世界保卫和平大会上表达了十几万万人民对和平的热望，与保卫世界和平的信念。这些代表都有各自的政治见解和宗教信仰；但是为了和平，大家都团结起来了，紧紧地团结起来了！
    在希特勒法西斯加诸华沙的创伤还未完全恢复，惨痛的痕迹犹历历在眼前的时候，我们听见了朝鲜代表的愤怒的控诉。是谁把朝鲜人民历代积累下来的文化、古迹、建筑物摧毁成瓦砾和变成灰烬的呢？是谁在朝鲜制造可怕的死亡，制造大批寡妇与孤儿的可怕的现状？如果不急急起来制止，第三次大战的火焰就可能在整个亚洲点起来。中国代表向大会陈述这样的心情：中国人民刚站起身来，开始和平生产建设，又立刻受到严重的战争威胁，因此正在坚决援助朝鲜反抗美国侵略。许多国家的代表一致谴责美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的暴行，要求立即撤出在朝鲜的、美国指挥的侵略军队。从大会上可以看出各国人民何等关怀着亚洲的局势呵！
    希腊、芬兰、巴基斯坦申述了帝国主义在那些国家侵犯主权，发动内战，使人民流血牺牲，失业贫困的事实。巴基斯坦代表响亮地宣言：每一个巴基斯坦人民，都不愿为帝国主义做工具。这正说明了被帝国主义所分裂或所奴役的国家的人民的意念。
    罗伯逊先生的正义的歌声，冲破了压迫和阻挠，经过录音片，响遍了大会，响彻了全世界。“美国那一块田野，那一幢建筑没有黑人的血和汗？但是他们得到的是非人的生活和奴隶的待遇……”“是的，谁有权利阻止我们像一个人那样生活？谁有权利造成一个种族的贫困和不幸，摧残和压制了他们的智慧，使他们的文化停滞在几世纪以前？是谁在准备大量杀人和灭绝人类的原子武器与细菌武器？”我们听见英国的红衣主教约翰逊也发出了不平的叫喊：为了侵略而加害别人，这叫什么文明？
    如果把罪行叫做文明，这是帝国主义者和他的走卒有意修改世界的词典。波兰的代表沉痛地说道：“虽然我们每天都在修复和重建，但创伤的痕迹每刻都刺激着我们心中的仇恨。美帝国主义者现在已完全继承了希特勒的衣钵，并且露骨地屠杀与毁灭着朝鲜了。我们听见了朝鲜人民的呼喊：朝鲜人民永远忘不了对美帝的仇恨。我们懂得复仇！一个朝鲜母亲把自己被炸死的儿子撂在河中以后，参加游击队去了。这样的母亲难道只有一个吗？
    美帝欠下的血账，即令世界上最厚的本子也记不完。它记载在每一个受奴役，被侵害的人民的心里。它受到世界上所有善良人的谴责。
    是的，人们是经过了死亡、苦难的教训，经过了良心的斗争，才走到创伤累累的华沙来宣告人们对和平的渴望和保卫和平的决心，痛斥帝国主义的罪行。华沙不是什么名胜区，成千成百的不同政治见解，不同宗教信仰，不同职业的男、女、老年人、和青壮年，摆开了繁忙的职务，到这儿来为的是什么呢？
    为了世界和平，这些先生和女士都到这里来了。为了保卫和平这共同的信念，彼此了解了，信赖了。过去的一些误解都消失在正义与良知的交流中了。我们都是善良的人，我们都是有清晰的头脑，能辨别历史的去向的人，我们都是从灾难里挣扎出来的人，今后再没有任何怪论，任何力量可以分裂我们的了。大家一致响应主席居里先生的号召，讨论具体的办法并成立各种组织，以便有效地制止侵略。
    十万万人民的团结的意志，不能战胜一小撮的凶蛮的帝国主义么？——黄泉里的希特勒的幽魂可以解答这个疑问。
    现在我们团结的范围比第二次大战时期更广泛了；我们的力量更壮大了。谁也不怀疑团结就是力量这句话了。
    二届和大胜利了，全世界爱好和平的善良的人们胜利了。我们团结得像一个人一样。不分种族，不分信仰，不分职业的代表们的无数次的握手、拥抱、亲吻和交谈增加我们灵魂的亲近。这儿没有种族的偏见，民族的仇恨，而只有各国人民之间的互信。人民的这种互信，击败了帝国主义者所散布的分裂人类的恶毒思想。人民已团结起来，更英勇地为世界永久和平而斗争了。让帝国主义者在我们面前发抖吧！     （一九五○、十一、二十二闭会之夕。）
