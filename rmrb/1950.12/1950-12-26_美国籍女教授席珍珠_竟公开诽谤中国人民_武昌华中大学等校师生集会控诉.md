Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 24th: All students and teachers of private Huazhong University and Wenhua Middle School and other church schools in Wuchang held an "Anti-Slander, Anti-Insult" accusation meeting on the evening of the 21st to oppose Miss Sheets, an American professor in the Foreign Language Department of the Faculty of Arts at Huazhong University, for publicly slandering the Chinese people and obstructing the students of the school from participating in the imperialist behavior of military cadre schools.

On the 15th of this month, second-year students of the Foreign Language Department of the Faculty of Arts at Huazhong University, in order to actively respond to the government's call to participate in various military school activities, suggested that the school postpone the French class examination for two weeks. The school adopted and officially announced this decision. However, Miss Sheets, an American professor, disregarded the school's decision and insisted on giving the exam immediately in an attempt to prevent students from participating in patriotic activities at military schools. When the students of the department explained the reason to her, she rudely scolded them and threatened to stop the French class. At the same time, Pearl Sheets consistently spread imperialist rhetoric among students in her daily teaching work. She described the People's Liberation Army's march to liberate its own territory of Tibet as so-called "aggression" against Tibet; and the bloody facts of the American armed aggression against Korea and the massacre of the Korean people as so-called "UN sanctions." She unscrupulously slandered the Chinese people, saying that the Chinese people would not be able to run customs, advocating that foreigners should do it; she even disregarded China's sovereignty and said that it was right for foreigners to set up concessions in China. Pearl Sheets defended American Wall Street financial groups and war-mongers in class. She said, "American capitalists do not want war." She also slandered the Chinese people's vigorous movement to resist the United States, aid Korea, and defend the country. After the Student Union of the school announced the above series of facts, it immediately aroused infinite anger among teachers and students of the school and other church schools in Wuchang.

In addition to all the students and teachers of Huazhong University, more than 1,000 students from church schools such as Wenhua Middle School and Hilida Girls' Middle School participated in the accusation meeting on the evening of the 21st. At the meeting, all the teachers and students indignantly accused the imperialist element Pearl Sheets of slander and insult to the Chinese people. Dong Xiaocheng, a student of Huazhong University, said: "In the past, I was paralyzed by American imperialism and did not realize the harm of imperialist ideology to us; now I am awake, we must fully expose it, we must examine and cleanse the toxins in our own minds, so that we can truly love our motherland." Ning Yuanmou, a teaching assistant in the Department of Economics of the school, painfully recalled in his accusation that imperialism forced us not to use our own language. He said: "In the past, a Professor Xu who taught Chinese was driven out by the American accounting director, Ke Yuehan, because he could not speak English when he received his salary." Hu Zhida, a student of the school, also recalled that the residences of American and British teachers at Bowen Middle School and Enxu Elementary School used to have signs insulting the Chinese people such as "Chinese Not Allowed" and "Students Not Allowed." Ren Xinggui, a Christian, said: "Chinese young students should safeguard the dignity of their motherland and absolutely cannot tolerate imperialist ideology and imperialist elements occupying the school." The representative of the Education Workers' Union of the school proposed to the meeting that the school immediately dismiss Pearl Sheets from her position as professor.

The patriotic and just actions of Huazhong University and other church schools have been supported by students and teachers from various schools in Wuhan. They have demanded that the imperialist element Pearl Sheets, who slandered the Chinese people, be severely punished.

    美国籍女教授席珍珠
    竟公开诽谤中国人民
    武昌华中大学等校师生集会控诉
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】武昌私立华中大学和文华中学等教会学校全体学生和教师，于二十一日晚间举行“反诽谤、反侮辱”控诉大会，反对华中大学文学院外文系美籍女教授席珍珠（Miss Sheets）公开诽谤中国人民，阻挠该校学生参加军事干部学校的帝国主义行为。
    本月十五日，华中大学文学院外文系二年级学生为积极响应政府号召参加各种军事学校活动，曾建议学校暂缓两星期举行法文课考试，经学校采纳并正式公布，但美籍教授席珍珠竟漠视学校的决定，专横地要立即考试，企图阻碍学生参加军事学校的爱国活动。该系学生向她说明理由，却被席珍珠粗暴地大骂，并用停止法文课相威胁。同时，席珍珠在平日教学工作中一贯在学生中散布帝国主义言论。她把我人民解放军进军解放自己国家的领土西藏，说成是所谓“侵略”西藏；把美国武装侵略朝鲜、屠杀朝鲜人民的血腥事实，说成是所谓“联合国的制裁”行为。她对中国人民大肆污蔑，说什么中国人民不会办海关，主张由外国人来办；她甚至漠视中国的主权，竟说外国在中国设租界是应该的。席珍珠在上课时曾替美国华尔街财阀和战争贩子们辩护。她说“美国大资本家不愿战争”。她并曾污蔑中国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。上述一系列的事实由该校学生会公布后，立即在该校及武昌其他教会学校的师生中激起无限愤怒。
    参加二十一日晚间控诉大会的，除华中大学全体学生及教师外，还有教会学校文华中学、希理达女中等校学生一千余人。会上全体师生愤慨地控诉帝国主义分子席珍珠对于中国人民的诽谤和污辱。华中大学学生董孝诚说：“过去我受了美帝国主义的麻痹，没有认识帝国主义思想对我们的毒害；现在我觉悟了，我们要尽情地揭露，我们要检查清洗自己思想中的毒素，才能真正热爱我们的祖国。”该校经济系助教宁远谋在控诉中沉痛地追述帝国主义强迫我们不准使用自己的语言文字。他说：“过去有一个教国文的徐教授，因不会英文在领薪金时被美籍会计主任柯约翰赶了出来。”该校学生胡治达并追述过去博文中学、恩旭小学的美、英教员住宅都挂着“华人止步”、“学生止步”等侮辱中国人民的牌子。基督教徒任兴桂说：“中国青年学生，应该维护自己祖国的尊严，绝对不能容忍帝国主义思想与帝国主义分子盘踞在学校内。”该校教育工作者工会代表向大会提议，要求学校立即解除席珍珠的教授职务。
    华中大学等教会学校的爱国主义正义行动，已得到武汉市各学校的学生和教师的拥护和支持，他们纷纷要求对诽谤中国人民的帝国主义分子席珍珠加以严厉制裁。
