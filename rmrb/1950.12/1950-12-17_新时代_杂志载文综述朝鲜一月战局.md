Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th: The latest issue of "New Era" magazine features an article by Pleshakov summarizing the situation in Korea. The article states: During the period from October 25th to November 24th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, while engaging in defensive activities, launched a powerful counterattack, forcing the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman forces to retreat from the area between the Chongchon River and the Yalu River. This counterattack marked a turning point in the war. First, the U.S. interventionist forces, despite their aggressive offensive, failed to occupy the favorable locations they desperately needed to invade China. Second, the Korean People's Army held the area between the two rivers, serving as a strategic forward position for launching a subsequent general counteroffensive.

The adventurer and war criminal MacArthur, disregarding the heavy casualties suffered by his troops, issued orders for a new so-called "decisive" offensive on November 24th. The offensive was launched simultaneously in the northwest and northeast regions. However, this offensive was again contained by a series of counterattacks launched by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

This counterattack by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers then developed into a general counteroffensive, becoming a strategic pursuit of the enemy. In the battles from November 25th to December 1st, the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers killed, wounded, and captured 23,700 enemy officers and soldiers, and seized a large number of war spoils.

An important fact to remember is that a widespread guerrilla war has unfolded in the rear of the U.S. interventionist forces. In the Seoul area, guerrillas are operating on a wide front. As the U.S. and British interventionist forces retreated, the ranks of the guerrillas greatly expanded. Normal traffic has been cut off on the roads northwest and south of Seoul. Scattered units and convoys of the interventionist forces dare not risk traveling on the roads.

In an attempt to stop the advance of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces and save the remnants of his defeated army, MacArthur used huge air force formations to bomb the People's Army troops and transportation routes all day long. However, the aerial bandits were met with strong resistance, and they suffered heavy losses from ground fire and air combat. No matter how hard he tried, MacArthur was unable to form a new front line, and his troops continued to flee under the blows of the People's Army and the guerrillas. On December 6th, Pyongyang was liberated.

The Korean People's Army is advancing rapidly in order to liberate the entire Korean Peninsula from the hands of the American aggressors.

    “新时代”杂志载文综述朝鲜一月战局
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“新时代”杂志最近一期刊载普列沙科夫所撰朝鲜战局综述一文。该文略称：朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军在自十月二十五日至十一月二十四日这一期间内，一方面致力于防御活动，一方面即发动强大的反击迫使美军及李承晚军退出清川江与鸭绿江之间的地区。这一次反击标志着战事的转折点。第一，美国干涉军尽管进攻时声势汹汹，却未能占据他们所急欲获得的侵略中国所必需的有利地点；第二，朝鲜人民军守住了两江之间的地区，作为随后发动总反攻的战略前进阵地。
    冒险家兼战争罪犯麦克阿瑟，不顾其军队所蒙受的重大伤亡，又于十一月二十四日发布了新的所谓“决定性”攻势的命令。攻势在西北及东北地区同时发动。但这个进攻又被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军所发动的一系列反攻遏止了。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军这次的反击，接着发展成为总反攻，成为战略上的追击敌人。在十一月二十五日至十二月一日的战斗中，人民军与中国人民志愿军毙伤俘敌军官兵二万三千七百人，并缴获大量战利品。
    必须记着的重要事实是：美国干涉军的后方已展开了广泛的游击战。在汉城地区，游击队正在广泛的战线上出动。当美英干涉军撤退的时候，游击队的行列大大地壮大起来了。汉城西北和南方的道路上，正常交通已经断绝。干涉军的零星部队和汽车队，完全不敢冒险在道路上行驶。
    麦克阿瑟为了想阻止朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的推进，并挽救其惨败的军队的残余，使用了巨大的空军编队，终日不停地轰炸人民军部队和交通。但是，空中强盗们却受到了坚强的抵抗，地面火力和空战使他们遭受了严重的损失。不管怎样努力，麦克阿瑟总是不能形成新的战线，他的军队在人民军队和游击队的打击下，继续溃逃。十二月六日，平壤便告解放。
    朝鲜人民军正在以迅速的步伐前进，以便把整个朝鲜半岛从美国侵略者的手中解放出来。
