*People's Literature*, Volume 3, Issue 2, was published on December 1st. To coordinate with the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, this issue published eight essays, prose pieces, and poems on the subject. Among them, Mao Dun's "Stripping the Mask from the 'Masked Bandit'" sharply pointed out the sinister plot of American imperialism's decadent culture to anesthetize the people at home and abroad.

Ding Ling's "The Life of a Real Person," Li Guangtian's "Preface to Selected Works of Wen Yiduo," and Huang Yaomian's "Preface to Selected Works of Jiang Guangci" provide generalized and systematic analyses of the creative paths of three influential writers since the May Fourth Movement.

The short story "Cannot Be Put Into Storage," by Sun Jingrui, depicts a rural cadre who, due to a sense of complacency after the land reform and neglect of militia work, finally becomes aware because of the sabotage of special agents. It is a powerful reminder of the current anti-spy and anti-rumor campaign. Other creative works include Yang Shuo's "Girl Chunzi," Yang Ping's "On the Grassland," and Caldwell's "The Story of Black Abel Lawson" (translated by Wang Lianhua), among others.

The poems include Zhang Zhimin's "The General and His Warhorse," Zhu Ziqi's "Walking on the Square in Front of Tiananmen," and two poems by Korean poets Kim Cho-gyu, "Among These People" and Kim Sang-o's "The Flame That Cannot Be Extinguished" (translated by Jin Wei).

In addition, there are several short essays written by Shi Yi, Wang Shuming, Zang Kejia, and others.
