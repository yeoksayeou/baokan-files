    Xinhua News Agency, London, December 23rd: TASS reports that the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party has issued a statement, signed by the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Harry Pollitt, protesting the decision of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty nations to rearm West Germany and calling on the British people to reject this decision.
    The statement begins by saying that the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting in Brussels is a betrayal of the British nation. The statement goes on to cite statistics on the losses suffered by the British people in the last war, and also points out the enormous sacrifices made by the Soviet people in the struggle against Hitler's Germany, emphasizing that the United States is now demanding that former Nazis, former enemies of the British people, be armed to attack Britain's heroic ally in wartime. The decision to rearm the Nazis is an insult to the living and the dead. The statement continues that the issue is not merely the reconstruction of the hateful German invading army, but the complete annihilation of the last vestiges of British independence. The British army will be placed under the command of the American supreme commander. The United States will also appoint a "commander-in-chief of production" to control British industrial and economic policy.
    Under American orders, the already enormous arms program is to be greatly increased, placing unlimited new burdens on the working people. This plan means the destruction of Britain, not its defense.
    The statement continues that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which suffered the most from Nazi aggression, are fighting for a unified, peaceful Germany, and against the remilitarization of Germany. This solution to the German question is also in the best interests of the British people. For the sake of Britain's heroes, and for our sons and daughters, for our mothers and children, we must stop the implementation of the treasonous Brussels plan.
    We have all said: "No more war!" Now let us say it again: let the British government know that under no circumstances will the British people participate in America's aggressive war against the Soviet Union.
    The Communist Party calls for a great patriotic movement, unanimously demanding: rejection of the Brussels decision; no rearmament of Germany; support for a unified and demilitarized Germany; the conclusion of a peace treaty, followed by the withdrawal of occupation forces; negotiations with the Soviet Union; and severance of relations with the North Atlantic Treaty and the American war policy.
    "Peace depends on the people – let the people act!"

    英共号召人民开展爱国运动
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十三日讯：英国共产党执行委员会顷发表一项由英共总书记波立特签名的声明，抗议侵略性的北大西洋公约各国重新武装西德的决定，并号召英国人民摈斥这一决定。
    声明首称，北大西洋公约理事会布鲁塞尔会议的决定乃是对英国民族的出卖。声明在进一步征引了英国人民在上次大战中所受损失的统计材料，并同时指出苏联人民在对希特勒德国的斗争中所付出的巨大牺牲后，强调指出：美国现在要求把从前的纳粹分子，从前英国人民的敌人武装起来，来进攻英国战时的英勇的盟友。重新武装纳粹的决定是对生者与死者的一种侮辱。声明继称，但是，问题并不仅仅是重建可恨的德国侵略军队，而是连英国独立的最后一点残迹也要被消灭净尽。英国军队将交给美国的最高统帅来指挥。美国也将任命一个“生产的总司令”来控制英国的工业与经济政策。
    在美国的命令之下，已经异常庞大的军备计划还要大大地增加，在劳动人民身上加上无限新的负担。这个计划意味着毁灭英国，而不是保卫英国。
    声明继称，受纳粹侵略祸害最深的苏联和人民民主国家正在为统一的、和平的德国而斗争，为反对德国的重新军事化而斗争。这样来解决德国问题也是最符合英国人民的利益的。为了英国的英雄们，并且为了我们的儿女，为了我们的母亲和孩子们，我们必须制止卖国的布鲁塞尔计划的实施。
    我们大家都说过：“决不再要战争了！”现在让我们再这样说吧：让英国政府知道，无论在怎样的情形之下，英国人民决不参加美国进攻苏联的侵略战争。
    共产党号召展开伟大的爱国运动，一致要求：摈斥布鲁塞尔的决定；不许重新武装德国，支持统一的和非军事化的德国；缔结和约，继之以撤退占领军；与苏联举行谈判；与北大西洋公约和美国的战争政策断绝关系。
    “和平系于人民——让人民行动起来！”
