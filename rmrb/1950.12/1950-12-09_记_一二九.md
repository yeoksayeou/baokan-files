Remembering the "December 9th" Movement
    Zifang

    The Eve of December 9th

    In the seven or eight years prior to December 9th, all of China, with the exception of some revolutionary areas, was in an era of extreme darkness.

    Before December 9th, where in China was like China? Where in Beijing was like a Chinese place?

    Before December 9th, the Kuomintang traitorous government, in addition to signing the Tanggu Truce and the He-Umezu Agreement, also issued the so-called "Good Neighborliness Ordinance." Any patriotic person who resisted Japan was guilty of "endangering the Republic of China." Traitors ran rampant everywhere: Yin Rugeng established the "Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" in eastern Hebei, and Tianjin Mayor Cheng Ke sent a circular telegram requesting the "independence" of the five provinces of North China. Large and small traitors in Beijing and Tianjin paraded in groups. Japanese military police and Kuomintang secret agents arrested people everywhere.

    "The vastness of North China no longer has room for a peaceful desk." (December 9th Declaration of Beijing Students) The students of Beijing could no longer endure it.

    On December 1, 1935, students from ten universities in Beijing, including Tsinghua University, issued a declaration calling for patriotic freedom, indignantly pointing out the Kuomintang government's traitorous and reactionary policies. The declaration stated: "Since the establishment of the capital (referring to the Kuomintang government), newspapers have recorded the massacre of as many as 300,000 young people, and the number of missing supervisors is even more countless. Killing them is not enough, they are buried alive; forbidding them is not enough, they are subjected to brutal torture. Hell is manifested, what kind of world is this?"

    After reading the declaration, the patriotic youth of China suppressed the anger in their hearts, gritted their teeth, clenched their fists, and successively joined secret patriotic organizations such as the Anti-Japanese Association, the National Armed Self-Defense Association, and the Anti-Imperialist League. They also united the broad masses of young people to carry out anti-Japanese and national salvation propaganda and education.

    In Beijing, the general youth and students already had a common demand to strike at the atrocities of Japanese invaders and traitors, step forward, and express the true public opinion of resisting Japan and saving the country. However, under the reactionary rule at that time, it was very difficult for the majority of students to have an organization to call for unified action. In such a critical situation for the nation, advanced students initiated the organization of the Beijing Students' Federation. This organization was established on November 18th. It represented the will of the people and youth of the whole country, so the great patriotic movement it launched was unstoppable.

    On December 3rd, the Third Congress of the Beijing Students' Federation discussed and decided on action: to petition the Kuomintang government to demand resistance against Japan and national salvation. On the same day, Tsinghua University held a general student meeting, uniting students from various schools to conduct a petition march.

    Under the Broadswords and Water Cannons

    "Down with Japanese imperialism!" rang through the clouds. When the first cry was uttered, we couldn't help but burst into tears.

    "Oppose the autonomy of North China!"

    "Strive for patriotic freedom!"

    "Stop the civil war and unite against foreign enemies!"

    "Oppose the government's policy of compromise diplomacy!"

    In the harsh north wind, every young person raised their arms and shouted.

    This was on December 9, 1935.

    The students in Beijing City went to Huiren Hall in Zhongnanhai to petition He Yingqin (the representative of the Kuomintang traitorous government), demanding resistance against Japan and national salvation, but were rejected. When marching to Wangfujing Street, they were attacked by broadswords and water cannons.

    The ice frozen on their clothes ignited the anger of every student.

    Many students were injured by broadswords. The injured students passionately shouted against Japan.

    Students from Tsinghua University and Yenching University were detained outside Xizhimen. In the cold wind outside the city, everyone struggled for a whole day.

    "After this petition, we realized that the rulers are simply not Chinese, and have lost the morality of being Chinese. We will no longer petition in the future," many students said after the petition.

    Xuanwumen

    We must have greater actions to demonstrate to the Japanese invaders and traitors.

    December 16th: a large demonstration by Beijing students.

    The various schools in the city were surrounded by Kuomintang military police, and the students climbed over the walls and combined into a team of more than 10,000 people. Students from schools outside the city, such as Tsinghua and Yenching, were refused entry at Xizhimen and Fuchengmen. When they arrived at Xibianmen, the city gate was still tightly closed. At this time, the masses were very angry and broke through the iron city gate with their flesh and blood.

    A mass meeting was held outside Zhengyangmen. Resolutions were passed not to recognize the Hebei-Chahar Political Council (the puppet organization of the Japanese invaders at the time), to resist the Japanese invaders, to recover the lost territories in the Northeast, and to demand patriotic freedom.

    After the meeting, they marched to Xuanwumen, which was tightly closed. Citizens came to comfort them and sent tea and cakes.

    In the evening, more than 10,000 students persisted in their courage to fight, unafraid of danger, and fought with Kuomintang military police in front of Xuanwumen. Nearly 300 people were injured.

    Go to the Countryside

    After the petition, a demonstration, what will happen after the demonstration?

    Carry out extensive anti-Japanese and national salvation education.

    Go to the countryside! Students and farmers unite! Develop the anti-Japanese and national salvation student movement into an anti-Japanese and national salvation people's movement.

    The Pingjin Student Federation organized a southward expansion propaganda group, with 3,000 participants, propagating along the Pinghan Railway, in the countryside. Beijing students were divided into three groups, and Tianjin students into one group, preparing to converge in Gu'an. The propaganda group set off on January 3, 1936.

    This group of students, wearing scarves, "jackets," aviation caps, and rubber shoes, sang national salvation songs all the way.

    When they arrived at a village, at first, some farmers said: "The religious people are still coming to the countryside to preach in such cold weather, and they are singing hymns in their mouths!"

    For the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, the students patiently propagated. Everyone walked a long distance of more than a dozen counties, experienced more than twenty days of wind and frost, and many people learned about the lives of the vast, hardworking farmers who were exploited and oppressed.

    Everyone was thinking, what kind of country and what kind of society is reasonable?

    In the propaganda group, some revolutionary youths told everyone that a people's country and a society of working people were needed. Only in this way can we defeat Japanese imperialism and save the country from danger.

    "The Soviet Union is a communist country, a new life of freedom and equality. Everyone works, hey cough hey cough, everyone works." This little tune of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army was popular in the propaganda group.

    In just over twenty days, many students determined their revolutionary outlook on life and yearned for the socialist country of the Soviet Union. They saw infinitely bright prospects for the future of China.

    Outside Gu'an City

    "All the way through wind and frost to Gu'an, everyone arrives at the city gate." Gu'an was the place designated by the Pingjin Student Federation for the three groups from Beijing and one group from Tianjin to converge.

    We held a meeting outside Gu'an City.

    "Winter is here, can spring be far behind?" Dong Yuhua, chairman of the Beijing Student Federation, repeated this sentence of the poet Shelley at the meeting.

    Three thousand people applauded.

    Dong Yuhua presided over the discussion of slogans: "Down with imperialism!" or "Down with Japanese imperialism!"

    This slogan was discussed and eventually resolved.

    These two slogans are not contradictory. To overthrow Japanese imperialism is to overthrow imperialism. Japanese imperialism was the most dangerous and direct enemy of China at that time, so the slogan "Down with Japanese imperialism!" should be put forward.

    The National Vanguard

    One night in Gaobeidian Village.

    Surrounded by Kuomintang military police, the students of the third regiment of the propaganda group held hands and said: "We want to form a permanent, strong, and advanced patriotic organization." At that time, it was named the National Salvation Vanguard Regiment.

    Everyone fought with the Kuomintang military police sent from Beijing in the small shops in Gaobeidian Village. The Kuomintang military police brought water cannons to attack with water and wanted to burn the houses to attack with fire.

    In the end, this propaganda group was unreasonably disbanded.

    However, the spirit of patriotism can never be disbanded. After the four propaganda groups returned to Beijing and Tianjin, they established a unified mass organization of advanced youths, called the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard.

    The Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, abbreviated as the National Vanguard, played a great pioneering role in the history of the December 9th student movement in Beijing.

    In the spring of 1937, the National Vanguard established a national headquarters in Beijing.

    Unite the Masses

    Advanced youths should understand the importance of uniting the broad masses and understand the policy of the Anti-Japanese National United Front.

    The students in Beijing learned this lesson from their own experience.

    In the early days of the December 9th Movement, some progressive students in Beijing also had a tendency to detach themselves from the masses by "talking about national salvation all day long and making national salvation friends." On March 31, 1936, progressive students held a funeral procession to mourn Guo Qing, a student from the 17th Middle School who was tortured and killed by the Kuomintang. Few general youth and students participated in this action, and as a result suffered a severe blow. Everyone therefore realized that relying only on the vanguard and not uniting the broad masses cannot achieve victory. From then on, more attention was paid to uniting teachers and students.

    During the commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident in 1936, teachers and students from various schools cooperated and held meetings separately to make solemn commemorations. Beijing students also organized many academic groups, which invited patriotic teachers to guide them. The anti-Japanese and national salvation movement of Beijing students has been integrated into the daily life of the majority of students. For example, the Beijing Student Federation paid attention to the employment and further education problems of students, helped poor students with their living problems, helped students with poor grades with their studies, and organized spring break trips and other activities. Politically, in many actions, the Beijing Student Federation put forward the slogan "Support the 29th Army in resisting Japan," mobilized students to carry out patriotic propaganda in the 29th Army, and strived for the 29th Army to resist Japan.

    The Surge of the National Student Movement

    After the December 9th Movement occurred, the Beijing Student Federation immediately sent representatives to the south to launch the national student movement.

    On December 11th, students from Zhejiang University and other schools held a large demonstration of more than 10,000 people. On the 12th, Sun Yat-sen University and other schools in Guangzhou held a strike.

    After December 16th, the national student movement became even more surging.

    On the 19th, 10,000 students in Shanghai petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Kuomintang Government and were rejected. On the 24th, more than 2,000 students from Fudan University and other schools in Shanghai went to Nanjing to petition. Kuomintang military police destroyed the railway in order to block them. Students from Fudan University, Tongji University, and other schools repaired the railway themselves and drove the train themselves.

    On the 21st, students in Wuchang held a large demonstration. In a surge of anger, they destroyed the Construction Bureau of the Kuomintang traitorous government in Hubei Province.

    Subsequently, demonstrations were held in cities across the country.

    The central hub of the national student movement—the Chinese Student National Salvation Federation—was established in Shanghai on May 29, 1936.

    Joining Forces with the World Youth Movement

    After the news of December 9th spread to the world, the International Student Federation designated April 22nd to 29th, 1936, as the World Week to Aid Chinese Students.

    "The struggle of Chinese students is also our struggle!" The International Student Federation issued a call to students around the world.

    After receiving the letter from the International Student Federation, Chinese students felt that the Chinese patriotic movement was not isolated, but was merging with the world youth anti-aggression movement.

    The Pingjin Student Federation launched a Beijing-Tianjin student response to the world youth movement on April 22nd.

    Beijing students held an international anti-aggression movement propaganda week. Many school gates were decorated with large gauze lanterns with slogans against imperialism, against war, and against aggression.

    At that time, Kuomintang secret agents distorted the slogan "anti-war," saying that it was "opposing resistance against Japan." Tsinghua University issued a declaration on this matter, explaining that China's resistance against Japan was to defend world peace. Anti-war is to oppose the imperialist war of aggression.

    In August 1936, the first World Youth Congress was held in Geneva, and the Chinese Student Federation sent representatives to participate.

    On August 25, 1937, the International Student Federation held a congress, attended by Chen Zhutian, a representative of the Chinese Student Federation, and Cao Chengxian, a representative of the National Vanguard.

    At the invitation of the Chinese Student Federation, the International Student Federation delegation came to China in May 1938, strengthening the connection between world students and Chinese students.

    Combining with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large number of students who participated in the December 9th Movement joined the people's army—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

    The students took off their student uniforms, changed their student accents, and worked with workers and peasants under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to persist in the War of Resistance Against Japan in the enemy's rear and build the New Democratic Liberated Areas.

    A relatively well-known fact is that Comrade Huang Jing, one of the leaders of the December 9th student movement in Beijing, was one of the main founders of the Jizhong Base Area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Comrade Yang Xuecheng, another leader of the December 9th student movement in Beijing, led students and farmers, starting with seven broken guns, to persist in the War of Resistance Against Japan in central Hubei. Later, this base area developed into the Central Plains Liberated Area. Comrade Zeng Sheng, a student of Sun Yat-sen University who participated in the December 9th Movement in Guangzhou, became the creator of the Dongjiang Column during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    Students combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the working masses is the path taken by the December 9th youth and the path that Chinese students should take.

    Chairman Mao said: "The final division of revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary youth depends on whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants." The December 9th Movement proved that this statement is completely correct.

    The Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party

    The December 9th Movement fully proves that the Chinese youth movement must be carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Without the leadership of the Party, the December 9th Movement could not have been so broad, deep, and lasting.

    The December 9th Movement responded to the great call of the Chinese Communist Party's August 1st Declaration. The Party's proposition of the Anti-Japanese National United Front and the Party's policy of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants were unconditionally accepted by the youth in the December 9th Movement.

    Strengthen National Defense Construction

    To commemorate the 15th anniversary of December 9th, the main task of young students is to defend the motherland and actively participate in national defense construction.

    Today, our country's most dangerous enemy is US imperialism.

    Today, the Chinese people have seized power, and the dark rule of the United States and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China has been overthrown.

    US imperialism is not reconciled to this failure, so it occupies our Taiwan and massively invades neighboring Korea, threatening our country's security.

    Our students across the country must inherit the glorious fighting tradition of December 9th, learn about the navy, air force, and tanks, and build a strong, modern, and powerful national defense force with a strong navy, land force, and air force for our own country.

    记“一二九”
    子方
    一二九前夕
    在一二九以前的七八年中，除了部分革命地区之外，全中国是处在一个极端黑暗的时代。
    在一二九以前，中国那里像中国？中国的北京那里像中国地方？
    一二九以前，国民党卖国政府在订了塘沽、何梅两个卖国协定以外，又颁布了所谓“睦邻令”。一个抗日爱国者都犯了“危害民国”的罪。汉奸到处横行：殷汝耕在冀东建立“防共自治政府”，天津市长程克通电要求华北五省“独立”，北京和天津的大小汉奸结队游行。日本宪兵、国民党特务到处捉人。
    “华北之大，已经安放不下一张平静的书桌了。”（北京学生一二九宣言）北京的学生们不能再忍受下去了。
    一九三五年十二月一日北京清华大学等十校学生发表宣言，争取爱国自由，愤慨地指出国民党政府的卖国反动的政策。宣言里说：“奠都以后（指国民党政府），青年之遭杀戳者，报纸记载至三十万人之多，而失踪监督者更不可胜计，杀之不快，更施以活埋，禁之不足，复加以毒刑，地狱现形，人间何世？”
    中国的爱国青年们读了宣言以后，都抑制着胸中的怒火，更咬紧牙关，握紧拳头，陆续参加抗日会、民族武装自卫会、反帝同盟等秘密的爱国团体，并团结广大青年，进行抗日救国的宣传教育。
    在北京，一般青年学生已经有了共同要求，打击日寇汉奸的暴行，挺身而出，表示真正的抗日救国的民意，但因为当时在反动统治下，广大学生很困难有号召统一行动的组织。在这样民族危急的形势下，先进学生便发起组织北平市学生联合会。这个组织是在十一月十八日成立。它是代表全国人民与青年的意志的，所以它发起的伟大的爱国运动一发而不可遏止。
    十二月三日北平市学生联合会第三次代表大会讨论并决定了行动：向国民党政府请愿要求抗日救国。同日清华大学开了全体学生大会，联合各校学生作请愿游行。
    大刀水龙之下
    “打倒日本帝国主义！”响彻云霄，当第一声喊出的时候，我们都不禁涌出了热泪。
    “反对华北自治！”
    “争取爱国自由！”
    “停止内战，一致对外！”
    “反对政府妥协外交！”
    在严寒的朔风中，每个青年攘臂高呼。
    这是在一九三五年的十二月九日。
    北京城里的学生走到中南海怀仁堂向何应钦（国民党卖国政府的代表）请愿，要求抗日救国，遭到拒绝。游行到王府井大街时，就遭到大刀水龙的袭击。
    衣服上冻的冰更燃起了每个同学的怒火。
    很多同学被大刀砍伤了。受伤的同学激昂地高呼抗日。
    清华大学和燕京大学学生被关在西直门外。在城外的冷风里，大家奋斗了一整天。
    “经过了这次请愿，我们认识了统治者简直不是中国人，失去了中国人为人的道德。我们以后将不再请愿。”许多学生在请愿以后这样说。
    宣武门
    我们必须有更大的行动，向日寇和汉奸示威。
    一二一六北京学生大示威。
    城内各校都被国民党军警包围，学生们都越墙而出，结合成为一万多人的队伍。城外的清华、燕京等校学生被拒于西直门、阜成门。到西便门时，还是城门紧闭。这时群众十分愤怒，以血肉以躯竟然冲破了铁的城门。
    在正阳门外，开了市民大会。通过了不承认冀察政委会（当时日寇的傀儡组织）、抵抗日寇、收复东北失地、要求爱国自由等议案。
    会后游行到宣武门，宣武门紧闭。市民纷纷来慰问，还送茶送饼。
    到了晚上，万余学生坚持着斗争的勇气，不怕危险的精神，在宣武门前和国民党军警搏斗。受伤的将近有三百人。
    到农村去
    请愿以后示威，示威以后将如何？
    进行广泛的抗日救国教育。
    到农村去！学生和农民结合！把抗日救国的学生运动发展为抗日救国的人民运动。
    平津学联组织了南下扩大宣传团，参加的有三千人，沿着平汉线，在农村里宣传。北京学生分三团，天津学生一团，准备在固安大会合。宣传团在一九三六年一月三日出发。
    这群学生们，围着围巾，穿着“夹克”，头戴航空帽，足登橡皮鞋，走一路唱一路救亡歌曲。
    到了一个村子，开始的时候，一些农民说：“吃教的在这么冷的天还下乡来传教，嘴里还唱着赞美诗哩！”
    为了抗日救国，同学们耐心地宣传。大家步行了十几县的长途，经历了二十多天的风霜艰苦，并且许多人都从此了解到广大的勤劳农民，被剥削被压迫的生活。
    大家心里都在想，怎样的一个国家，怎样的一个社会才是合理的呢？
    在宣传团里，一些革命青年告诉大家，需要一个人民的国家，需要一个劳动人民的社会。只有这样，才能打倒日本帝国主义，挽救国家于危亡之境。
    “苏联本是共产国，自由平等新生活。人人都工作，哎咳哎咳喓，人人都工作。”这个东北义勇军的小调，流行在宣传团里。
    在短短的二十多天里，很多同学确定了革命的人生观，向往着社会主义国家苏联。对将来的中国看到了无限光明的远景。
    固安城外
    “一路风霜到固安，大家一到城门关。”固安是平津学联拟定北京三个团和天津一个团会合的地方。
    我们在固安城外开会。
    “冬天到了，春天还会远吗？”北平学联主席董毓华在大会上重复了诗人雪莱这一句话。
    三千人都鼓掌。
    董毓华主持了对口号的讨论：“打倒帝国主义！”还是“打倒日本帝国主义！”
    这个口号经过讨论，到后来解决了。
    这两个口号并不是对立的。打倒日本帝国主义，就是打倒帝国主义。日本帝国主义是当时中国最危险最直接的敌人，所以应该提出“打倒日本帝国主义！”口号。
    民先队
    高碑店村的一夜。
    在国民党军警包围下，宣传团第三团的同学手携着手说：“我们要结成一个永久的坚强的先进的爱国团体。”当时定名为救亡先锋团。
    大家在高碑店村的小店里，和北京派来的国民党军警搏斗。国民党军警找来了水龙，用水来攻，又要烧房子，用火来攻。
    最后，这个宣传团遭到无理的解散。
    但是，爱国的精神是永远解散不了的。四个宣传团回到北京天津后成立了一个统一的先进青年的群众组织，名字叫中华民族解放先锋队。
    中华民族解放先锋队，简称民先，或民先队，在北京一二九学生运动史上，它起了很大的先锋作用。
    一九三七年春，民先队在北京成立了全国总队部。
    团结群众
    先进的青年，应该懂得团结广大群众，懂得抗日民族统一战线的方针。
    北京的学生从自身经验中懂得了这一教训。
    有一二九运动初期，北京的一些进步学生，也是有整天“谈救亡天，交救亡朋友”的脱离群众倾向。在一九三六年三月三十一日，进步学生们为了追悼被国民党虐杀的十七中学生郭清，举行过一次抬棺游行，这次行动，一般的青年学生参加的很少。结果遭受到严重打击。大家因此觉悟到，只依靠先锋，不团结广大群众，是不能取得胜利的。从此更注意到团结师长团结同学的问题。
    在一九三六年纪念“九一八”六周年时各校师生合作，都分别召开会议，作了沉痛的纪念。北京学生并组织了许多学术团体，这些团体请了爱国师长指导。北京学生的抗日救国运动已经和广大学生的日常生活结合起来。如北平学联注意到同学们失业升学问题，帮助贫苦同学生活问题，帮助功课不好的同学学习问题，并组织了春假旅行等活动。在政治上，北平学联在许多行动中，提出了“拥护二十九军抗日”口号，发动学生到二十九军里进行爱国宣传，争取二十九军抗日。
    全国学运的澎湃
    一二九运动发生之后，北平学联即派代表到南方发动全国学生运动。
    十二月十一日浙江大学等校学生便举行了万人以上的大示威。十二日广州中山大学等校举行罢课。
    一二一六之后，全国学运更形澎湃。
    十九日上海学生一万人向上海市国民党政府请愿。遭到拒绝。二十四日上海复旦大学等校学生二千多人去南京请愿。国民党军警为了拦阻他们破坏了铁路。复旦同济等校学生自己来修铁路，自己来开火车。
    二十一日武昌学生举行大示威。在群情愤激下，捣毁湖北省国民党卖国政府的建设厅。
    接着全国各城市都先后举行示威。
    全国学生运动的中枢——中国学生救国联合会，在一九三六年五月二十九日在沪成立。
    和世界青运合流
    一二九的消息传到全世界以后，国际学联规定了一九三六年四月二十二日到二十九日为全世界援助中国学生周。
    “中国学生的斗争，也是我们的斗争！”国际学联向全世界的学生发出号召。
    中国学生收到国际学联的函件以后，感到中国的爱国运动不是孤立的，而是和世界青年反侵略运动合流。
    平津学联发起北京天津学生在四月二十二日响应世界青年运动。
    北京学生举行国际反侵略运动宣传周。许多学校门口装上大纱灯，上书反帝反战反侵略的标语。
    当时国民党特务歪曲“反战”的口号，说是“反对抗战”。清华大学曾为这件事发表宣言，说明了中国对日抗战，即是保卫世界和平。反战是反对帝国主义的侵略战争。
    一九三六年八月在日内瓦召开的第一次世界青年大会，中国学联派了代表参加。
    一九三七年八月二十五日国际学联开代表大会。中国学生参加的有中国学联代表陈柱天、民先队代表曹承宪。
    国际学联代表团应中国学联之请，在一九三八年五月到中国来，加强了世界学生与中国学生的联系。
    和工农兵结合
    在抗日战争中，参加一二九运动的大批学生，参加了人民军队——八路军和新四军。
    学生们脱下学生装，改了学生腔，和工人农民一道，在中国共产党领导下，在敌后坚持抗日战争，建设了新民主主义的解放区。
    比较著名的事实，北京一二九学生运动的领导人之一黄敬同志，在抗日战争中，是冀中根据地主要建立者之一。北京一二九学生运动的另一领导人杨学成同志，带领了学生和农民在一起从七支破枪开始，在鄂中坚持抗日战争，后来这个根据地发展为中原解放区。参加广州一二九运动的中山大学学生曾生同志，在抗日战争中成为东江纵队的创造者。
    学生和工农兵结合，为工农大众服务，这是一二九青年所走的道路，是中国学生应走的道路。
    毛主席说：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的青年之最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行同工农民众相结合。”一二九运动证明了这话是完全正确的。
    中国共产党的领导
    一二九运动充分地证明着，中国青年运动必须在中国共产党的领导下进行。
    没有党的领导，一二九运动不可能那样广泛、深入与持久。
    一二九运动响应了中国共产党的八一宣言的伟大号召。党的抗日民族统一战线的主张、党的知识分子和工农结合的方针，都无条件地为一二九运动中青年所接受。
    加强国防建设
    纪念一二九的十五周年，青年学生们的主要任务是保卫祖国，踊跃参加国防建设。
    今天我国最危险的敌人是美帝国主义。
    今天中国人民已经掌握了政权，美国和国民党反动派在中国的黑暗统治已被推翻。
    美帝国主义不甘心这种失败，便侵占我台湾，并大肆侵略邻邦朝鲜，威胁我国安全。
    我们全国同学们，要继承一二九的光荣斗争的传统，学习海军、空军、坦克，为我们自己的祖国，建立强大的海陆空的近代的强大的国防军。
