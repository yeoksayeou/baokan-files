    Northwest Region's Yiguandao Followers
    Launch Mass Movement to Renounce the Religion
    Region Sees 100,000 Renunciations in Three Years
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] A mass movement of Yiguandao followers renouncing the religion is gradually unfolding in the Northwest region. It is estimated that since 1948, approximately 100,000 people in the region have renounced the religion.

    The vast majority of upper-level members of the Yiguandao reactionary organizations discovered in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia are spies, landlords, and local bullies. In addition to spreading rumors, deception, and raping women, they also organized black armies and black parties, plotting rebellion. The White Lotus Sect (i.e., Yiguandao) plot to riot case uncovered in Chaoyi, Shaanxi, on October 5th of this year, seized evidence such as knives, swords, seals, flags, yellow robes, and court boots. The principal offender, Xiong Chunxiu, claimed to be the emperor and had been organizing a black army since September of last year, plotting to attack the county seat. The reactionary Yiguandao leader Li Xingwu (Li Laodao), captured in Wuwei, is one of the Yiguandao leaders in Gansu. During the Anti-Japanese War, he provided intelligence to the Japanese army and later joined the Kuomintang secret service organization, serving as the leader of the Wuwei secret service team. After liberation, he often used "fortune-telling" and "bone-reading" as pretexts to incite enemy and puppet stragglers and incite and lure Hui and Tibetan compatriots into becoming bandits. In April of this year, under his instigation and organization, they attacked the district government, plotting a riot, which was eventually uncovered by our local public security organs, and all the bandits were arrested. In addition, Yiguandao uses a hypocritical appearance or utilizes social connections such as relatives and friends to infiltrate our troops and organs, collect intelligence, and organize mutinies, attempting to weaken the revolutionary forces. In individual areas, Yiguandao leaders act as village chiefs and control farmers' associations.

    Various localities, in conjunction with current work, use concrete examples to illustrate the crimes of Yiguandao. Through accusations from victimized masses and confessions of repentance from religious leaders, they enlighten the masses and turn the anti-Yiguandao struggle into a conscious movement of the masses, which has achieved certain results. For example, Han Rulian from He Dian Township, Hui County, Gansu, joined the religion because her child was sick, spending a lot of money, but the child still died. Yang Shenglian, a local women's representative, enlightened her, prompting her to publicly speak about her deception at a mass meeting. Using this method, 85 people were mobilized to renounce the religion successively. Zhang Kanru, an Yiguandao "predecessor" in Yulin, confessed at a mass meeting how she fabricated rumors and swindled money. The masses angrily said, "It is truly a monstrous and wicked cult," and 597 people automatically renounced the religion on the spot and reported a group of criminal religious leaders. Peasants in the eighth township of Guozhen District, Baoji, Shaanxi, who were deceived into joining Yiguandao, raised their awareness during the land reform and renounced the religion one after another. From mid-November to early December, more than 300 people had renounced the religion, including 170 men and 147 women. By this point, the Yiguandao organization in the township had been basically eliminated. Although individual elements stubbornly refused to renounce, they had become isolated among the masses.

### 西北地区一贯道徒  展开群众性退道运动  该区三年来退道人数已达十万

    西北地区一贯道徒
    展开群众性退道运动
    该区三年来退道人数已达十万
    【本报讯】西北地区一贯道徒群众性的退道运动逐步展开。据估计，从一九四八年以来，该地区退道人数已约有十万。
    陕、甘、宁各地所发现的一贯道反动组织，绝大多数的上层分子是特务、地主及恶霸等。他们除造谣、骗诈和奸淫妇女外，并组织黑军、黑党，阴谋叛乱。陕西朝邑在今年十月五日破获的白莲教（即一贯道）阴谋暴动案，缴出刀剑、印信、令旗、黄袍、朝靴等证件，主犯熊春秀自称皇帝，从去年九月就开始组织黑军，阴谋打县城。武威捕获的反动的一贯道头子李性悟（李老道），是甘肃一贯道头子之一，在抗日战争时期就给日军做情报工作，后来又参加了蒋匪特务组织，任武威特务组组长。解放后，时常以“看相”“摸骨”为名，煽动敌伪流散军人、挑拨诱骗回藏同胞为匪，今年四月在他的策动组织下，袭击区政府，阴谋暴动，终于被我当地公安机关破获，匪徒全部落网。此外，一贯道并以伪善面貌或利用亲友等社会关系，打入我部队、机关，收集情报，组织哗变等，企图削弱革命力量。个别地区一贯道头子活动当村长，把持农会。
    各地结合当前工作，以具体事例说明一贯道的罪恶，通过受害群众的控诉及道首的坦白悔过，启发群众觉悟，把反一贯道斗争变成群众的自觉运动，已收到一定成绩。如甘肃徽县贺店乡韩如莲，因小孩生病入了道，花了不少钱，结果孩子还是死了，当地妇女代表杨生莲，即对她启发教育，使她在群众会上，公开说出自己受骗情况，利用这种办法，先后发动了八十五人退道。榆林一贯道“前人”张侃儒，在群众大会上坦白她如何造谣、骗财等事实后，群众愤恨地说：“真正是伤天害理的妖门邪道”，当场就有五百九十七人自动退道，并检举了一批罪恶的道首。陕西宝鸡虢镇区第八乡被骗加入一贯道的农民，在土改中提高了觉悟，纷纷退出一贯道。自十一月中旬到十二月初旬，已有三百余人退道，其中男人一百七十人、妇女一百四十七人，至此一贯道在该乡的组织基本被肃清，虽有个别分子顽固不退，但在群众中已陷于孤立。
