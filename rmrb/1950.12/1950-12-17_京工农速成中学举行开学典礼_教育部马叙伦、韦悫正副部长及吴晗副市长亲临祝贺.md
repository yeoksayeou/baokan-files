He pointed out that the purpose of the People's Government's vigorous development of workers and peasants' education is to consolidate and develop the victory of the people. Culture was originally created by the working people, but in the past, it was used by the reactionary ruling class as a tool to oppress the working people. Today, the people have achieved victory, and the people have turned over politically, and they must also turn over culturally. Therefore, it is necessary to develop workers and peasants' education, improve the cultural and scientific knowledge level of the mass backbone workers and peasants' cadres, so that they can master science and technology and become national construction talents. He hoped that the students would cherish this learning opportunity, study hard, and that the school staff would attach importance to this work and complete it as an important political task.

Vice Mayor Wu called on everyone to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, cultivate experts and scholars, and consolidate and improve the achievements of the people's country. President Wang said: To transform an agricultural country into an industrial country, enrich the country and strengthen the military, and defend world peace, it cannot be achieved by political enthusiasm alone. We must strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge and improve technical level. Director Weng said: Cultivating a new type of worker-peasant intellectual is a serious revolutionary task, and teachers and students should unite and use all favorable conditions to complete it. Principal Hu told the students about her experience in running the Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School, hoping that they would not be discouraged when encountering some possible difficulties in their studies, and would overcome them with the greatest determination. Liu Fengjin, representative of the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on the Party and League members to become the backbone and core of the school's unity. All the students of the Teachers Training Class of the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School of the Normal University said in their congratulatory message: "Your learning task is important and sacred. On the one hand, you must complete your studies well, and on the other hand, you must help all working people have the opportunity to quickly enjoy cultural and scientific education."

Finally, representatives of teachers and staff and student representatives spoke. The representative of the teachers and staff said: We realize the importance of the task and are determined to strengthen political and professional learning. We will use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to transform ourselves and teach the students well.
