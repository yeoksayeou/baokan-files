Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: The "Message News" published a special article by Muravin on the 10th, using the activities of the American DuPont family as an example, to show who exactly is fattening themselves by drinking the blood of the Korean people, and who is filling their pockets through the imperialists' expansion movement.

Muravin wrote: A small group of the wealthiest and most powerful financial and industrial dynasties in the United States includes a family that has obtained record-breaking profits through the expansion movement, and that is the DuPont family. If the Rockefeller family is often called the oil king, then the DuPont family should be called the gunpowder king.

In the early 19th century, the DuPont family manufactured gunpowder, and later began to manufacture explosives. During the First and Second World Wars, they were the main supplier of trinitrotoluene, which is necessary for manufacturing various explosives. The First World War brought the DuPont family a huge profit of 200 million US dollars. During the Second World War and the post-war US expansion movement, the DuPont family has obtained 4 billion US dollars.

Before the Second World War, the DuPont family had already extended their tentacles to many corners of the globe. They controlled the United Rubber Company, which has large rubber tree plantations in Malaya and Indonesia, and dominated many industries in Latin America, including all chemical, automotive, and rubber industries in Argentina. In the United States, General Motors, the National Bank of Detroit, and several smaller banks, many newspapers, hotels, and other large buildings, including the Empire State Building in New York—the tallest skyscraper in the United States—have also become the property of the DuPont family.

Muravin continued to write: The profits of this manufacturer of death are increasing day by day. For example, in 1949, the net profit of General Motors, one of the vassals of the DuPont empire, reached an unprecedented huge amount of 656.4 million US dollars. Now, even this record-breaking number has been surpassed. In the first half of 1950, General Motors has already made a profit of 485 million US dollars. The source of these unbelievable huge profits is the expansion movement and government military orders. General Motors was the first of the 100 largest American companies that undertook most of the military orders during the Second World War, and the total number of orders it received reached 14 billion US dollars.

Now, amidst the clamor of American imperialists preparing for a third world war, the DuPont family is even more of a popular figure. The atomic bomb was manufactured in this company's factory. The representative of the DuPont family is a member of the Industrial Advisory Committee directly under the US Atomic Energy Commission. Truman also entrusted the same DuPont company to design and manufacture even more barbaric weapons of mass destruction—the hydrogen bomb. The US government’s special preference for these monopolists is partly due to their long-standing relationship with certain American political leaders. For example, when the current Secretary of State Acheson presided over the Washington Covington, Burling, Acheson law firm, he was the main legal advisor to the Ethyl Corporation, which is controlled by General Motors, and appeared in court to defend the interests of this company. DuPont family’s puppet, Carpenter, had been holding the important position of Director of the US Ordnance Bureau until recently.

The DuPont family maintains the closest ties with various American fascist organizations—these shock troops organized to combat the progressive movement. The DuPont family provides funding for the Black Guard organization "American Action Council" and other such groups. It has recently been revealed that one of the founders of this organization—the fascist Hart—has received 90,000 US dollars from DuPont family members in recent years alone, not counting the 50,000 US dollars allocated to Hart from General Motors' funds. Mont—the proposer of that infamous fascist bill—was helped by this manufacturer of death to be elected as a senator in 1948. The manufacturer of death donated 11,000 US dollars for this matter. This is how the big monopolists, who are directly related to the country's arms expansion and militarization, foster and cultivate fascism in the United States.

The American imperialists' adventure in Korea has greatly excited the swindlers on Wall Street. The American "Bakersfield Californian" shamelessly boasted in August 1950: The Korean War has increased the profits of major American companies by about 13 percent!

Muravin said in conclusion: While the Korean people are bleeding, and while the cities and villages of this suffering country are burning, gold bars are jingling into the vaults of the Wall Street millionaires. Every exploding bomb makes the vicious old Pierre Eleni and Lamont DuPont—these manufacturers of death and true war criminals who are addicted to human blood and gold—make a fortune.

    消息报发表专文
    论美国杜邦家族的罪恶
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《消息报》于十日刊出穆拉温的专文，以美国杜邦家族的活动为例，表明究竟是什么人靠喝朝鲜人民的血长肥的，是什么人靠帝国主义者所进行的扩军运动装满自己的荷包的。
    穆拉温写道：美国一小撮最有钱有势的金融与工业王朝中，包括一家靠扩军运动已获得创纪录的利润的家族，这便是杜邦家族。如果说，洛克菲勒家族常常被人称为煤油大王，那么，杜邦家族就应该被称为火药大王了。
    十九世纪初叶，杜邦家族就制造火药，后来就开始制造炸药，在第一次和第二次世界大战期间，是制造各种炸药所必需的三硝基甲苯的主要供给者。第一次世界大战使杜邦家族获得达二亿美元的巨额利润。在第二次世界大战和美国战后扩军运动期间，杜邦家族已获得了四十亿美元。
    在第二次世界大战以前，杜邦家族就已把他们的触须伸到全球许多角落。他们控制了在马来亚和印尼有大片橡树园的联合橡胶公司，支配了拉丁美洲的许多工业。包括阿根廷的全部化学工业、汽车工业和橡胶工业。在美国本国，通用汽车公司、底特律国民银行和若干较小的银行，许多报馆、旅馆及其他大建筑，包括纽约帝国大厦——美国最高的摩天楼——也都变成杜邦家族的财产了。
    穆拉温继续写道：这个死亡制造商的利润正日益增长。例如，一九四九年，杜邦帝国的诸侯之一通用汽车公司的纯利，达到六亿五千六百四十万元的空前巨大的数目。现在，连这个创纪录的数目也已经被超过了。在一九五○年上半年六个月内，通用汽车公司已获利四亿八千五百万元。这些令人难于置信的厚利的来源，便是扩军运动和政府的军事定货。通用汽车公司是占了在第二次世界大战期间承办大部分军事定货的一百家美国最大公司中的第一位，它所得的定货总数达一百四十亿美元。
    现在，在美国帝国主义者准备第三次世界大战声中，杜邦家族更是一个红人。原子弹就是在这家公司的工厂中制造的。杜邦家族的代表人是美国原子能委员会直属工业顾问委员会的委员。杜鲁门还责成这同一家杜邦公司设计制造更加野蛮的大规模毁灭生灵的武器——氢弹。美国政府对这些垄断资本家们特别偏爱，一部分是由于他们与美国某些政治领袖们有着历史悠久的关系。例如，现任国务卿艾奇逊在当年主持华盛顿科文敦·柏尔林·艾奇逊律师事务所的时候，便是为通用汽车公司所控制的乙基公司的主要法律顾问，曾出庭为这个公司的利益辩护。杜邦家族的傀儡卡本特，直到最近还一直在担任美国军需局局长的要职。
    杜邦家族跟美国各种法西斯组织——为打击进步运动而组织的这些挺进队——保持着最密切的联系。杜邦家族供给黑卫队组织“美国行动会”和别的这种团体的经费。最近已经泄露出来，这个组织的创办人之一——法西斯分子哈特，单说最近几年就从杜邦家族人员那里领到了九万美元，还不算从通用汽车公司的经费中划给哈特的五万元。蒙特——那恶名昭彰的一个法西斯法案的提案人，在一九四八年就是靠这家死亡制造商出钱帮助当选为参议员，死亡制造商为这件事曾捐赠一万一千元。跟国家的穷兵黩武和军国主义化直接有关的大垄断资本家们，就是这样在美国扶植栽培法西斯主义的。
    美帝在朝鲜的冒险，使华尔街的骗子们非常兴奋。美国的《巴克斯菲尔得·加利福尼亚》报，在一九五○年八月间曾厚颜无耻地夸口说：朝鲜战争已使美国各大公司的利润提高约百分之十三！
    穆拉温在结语中说：当朝鲜人民正在流血的时候，当这个苦难深重的国家的城市和乡村正在燃烧的时候，金条却在丁丁当当地滚进华尔街富翁的保险箱中。每一枚爆炸的炸弹，都使凶恶的老彼埃尔·爱伦尼和拉孟特·杜邦——这些死亡制造商和嗜好人血与黄金的真正战争罪犯们大发其财。
