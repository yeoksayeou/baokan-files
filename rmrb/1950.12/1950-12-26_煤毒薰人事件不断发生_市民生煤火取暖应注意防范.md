    Coal Poisoning Incidents Continue to Occur
    Citizens Should Take Precautions When Using Coal for Heating
    Recently, incidents of citizens of this city being poisoned by coal gas due to burning coal for heating have occurred continuously. According to statistics, eight people have died from coal gas poisoning in the past half month. On the 15th of this month, Guo Shenshi, a resident of No. 4, Pocket Alley, Second District, fell and died from coal poisoning. On the evening of the 20th, Zhao Duosheng, a resident of No. 10, Xiaohoujing, Third District, added coal to the fire and left it in the house. He fell into a coma in the middle of the night due to coal poisoning, causing the cotton quilt to catch fire and burn him to death. In addition, Cheng Chenshi, a resident of No. 27, Caichang Fifth Alley, Sixth District; Xiao Qin, daughter of Wang Zhongchen, a resident of No. 32, Xiaoqiao; Liu Shanquan, son of Liu Runzhi, a resident of No. 50, Public Warehouse, Fourth District; Wang Shuyan, director of the Soda Factory of Dazhong Industrial Company; and Liu Baoshan, a cook at Dashunlong Rice Milling Factory at No. 8, Dachuan Road, Ninth District, all died of poisoning after placing coal fires in their bedrooms and falling asleep. Therefore, citizens should pay close attention to the use of stoves. When burning smokeless coal stoves in rooms without chimneys, a ventilation window must be left open to allow fresh air to enter and coal gas to escape. This ventilation window is best located in the upper part of the room. At night, smokeless stoves should be moved out of the house before sleeping. The damper on stoves with chimneys should not be closed, otherwise the coal gas cannot escape through the chimney and will fill the room, causing poisoning. If citizens discover signs of coal poisoning, they should move the poisoned person to a well-ventilated room, taking care to keep them warm to avoid cold. In severe cases, they should be taken to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.

    煤毒薰人事件不断发生
    市民生煤火取暖应注意防范
    本市市民因烧煤火取暖致遭煤气薰死的事情近来连续发生。据统计半月来被煤气薰死者已有八人。本月十五日二区口袋胡同四号住户郭沈氏因中煤毒摔伤致死。二十日晚三区小后井十号住户赵多生将火添煤后放于屋内，半夜因中煤毒昏迷，以致棉被着火后被烧死。此外，六区草厂五条二十七号住户程陈氏、小桥三十二号住户王仲臣之女小琴、四区公用库五十号住户刘润之子刘山泉、大众实业公司苏打厂厂长王叔言、九区大川路八号大顺隆机器碾米厂厨工刘宝善等人，均因将煤火置于寝室内，睡觉后中毒身亡。因此市民燃用火炉亟应引起注意，凡在房间内燃烧无烟筒煤火炉，必须留下通风窗口，以流入新鲜空气并排除煤气，这个通风窗口，最好留在屋的较高部分。夜晚睡觉应将无烟筒火炉移出屋外。有烟筒的火炉不应将烟筒开关闭上，否则煤气因不能由烟筒泄出而充溢室内，同样可以中毒。市民如发现中煤毒情形，应将中毒者抬出放在空气流通的屋子，注意保暖，以免受冷。重者宜速送医院诊治。
