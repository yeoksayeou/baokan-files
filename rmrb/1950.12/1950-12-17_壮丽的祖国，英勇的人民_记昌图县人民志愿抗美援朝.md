    A Bumper Year After Emancipation
    On the morning of October 20th, we went from Changtu City (belonging to Liaoxi Province) to Dafangshen Fort Village. The sun had just turned red, and wisps of smoke rose from the farmhouses. In the vast wilderness, rows of harvested crops stood firmly in formation, like a group of sturdy young men. The heavy ears of sorghum and millet that had not yet been harvested swayed in the breeze. Before us was a magnificent picture of a bumper harvest. Accompanied by the rumbling of the wheels, we proudly sang:
    Our motherland is so vast and wide
    She has countless fields and…

    Dafangshen Fort Village has about thirty households. In every courtyard in front and behind the houses, rollers creaked and groaned; large piles of soybeans, millet, and sorghum made the houses seem small. Elderly men with gray hair and young men with rosy faces were stacking, rolling, and threshing in the warm sunshine, and innocent children were also joining in the fun; when they saw strangers coming, they worked even harder.

    Chatting with the village chief and secretary about this year's harvest, the village chief said excitedly, "This year is truly a good year that hasn't been seen in many years, just look!" He pointed to the villagers coming and going on the village road, "This year, everyone has recovered from fatigue and straightened their backs. Which family's granary isn't full?!” The secretary picked up the conversation and said, "If it were before liberation, our fort couldn't even support a dog. Now, who doesn't have a healthy donkey? These days, everyone is also planning to go to the province to buy carts!” He took two strong puffs of his pipe and then held up two fingers and said, "Come back in two years, comrades, and see!" The village chief moved his body forward a step and said, "People are really strange. In the past, they were afraid of work, now they can't even save the manure in the outhouse. As soon as spring comes, every family is afraid of not having enough fertilizer in the fields; three shovels and three trips, tending the fields so that there isn't even a weed, how can we not have a big harvest! Comrades, wait and see next year!"

    A little girl wearing a new floral jacket inside ran over, jumping and skipping, and said, "They told you to go to the labor model's house for dinner!" The sun pressed against the mountain, and the sounds of calling chickens, barking dogs, laughing, and shouting echoed in the village.

    The Raging Tide of Resisting America
    Just as the emancipated people were starting to have good days, American imperialism bared its fangs and claws and pounced on them. "Defend our good life, defeat the American paper tiger!" The tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country surged higher and higher.

    The peasants of Changtu County automatically organized hundreds of stretchers and were determined to go to Korea to participate in the war. Old Granny Li of the Twelfth District of Lishu County insisted on having her son assigned to the first batch of stretcher teams and repeatedly told her son, "Listen to the captain, take good care of the wounded comrades, and don't be a show-off like you are at home." Many district and village cadres were arguing and fighting to be the first to join the stretcher team. An old man in Sijiazi Village carried a straw mat he had woven himself and gave it to the village cadre, saying, "This is made of new rice straw, it's very soft, give it to the stretcher team, let them put it on when they carry the wounded!"

    "Select the best grain to hand over to the country to strengthen our national defense!" In the upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, everyone had this enthusiasm. An old man in the Fifth District of Changtu County selected and selected the public grain, picking it over and over again, without even a straw or杂瓣. He said, "I'm old and can't carry a stretcher, but sending good seeds as public grain is as good as fighting! Sending good public grain early is as good as beating the American bandits." Many demobilized soldiers were shouting to return to the battlefield and constantly slipped away to make requests to the local government. A disabled veteran in Changtu Gouwo Village, although not in good health, resolutely joined the stretcher team and even became a squad leader. A labor model in Dafangshen said, "During the time of the Kuomintang, no family could even keep a chick. That bunch of yellow wolves, good at stealing chickens, would climb the walls and wear rabbit shoes when a war broke out. The American soldiers and 'Chiang Kai-shek's army' are cut from the same cloth, what are we afraid of, if we don't beat them to death, are we going to keep them?!"

    No one can take away the fruits of the peasants' victory! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they are united like steel and iron. "We must smash the American bandits to pieces!" The words of an old man in the Fifth District of Changtu County at the stretcher rally represented the determination of thousands upon thousands of peasants.

    A Review of People's Power
    On October 23rd, the Liangjiaqiao District held a grand review of the people's power. People surged upward as if going to a fair, crowding Liangjiaqiao Village so tightly that not even a breeze could pass through. The stretcher poles were like cannons pointing to the sky, and the rolled-up straw mats were like wrapped-up shells that had not yet been fired. The villagers participating in the review were all wearing brand new green cotton jackets and new Ula boots. The young men were stronger than the last, lined up neatly. Everyone's face was shiny from being tanned by the sun. At eleven o'clock in the morning, the grand review began. Amidst bursts of applause, Comrade Wu explained the great significance of resisting America and aiding Korea and carefully inspected the stretchers, marching pots, and the team members' bodies and clothing. Then he announced to everyone, "Everyone's enthusiasm for volunteering to resist America and aid Korea is too high, I congratulate you: The result of the review is that not a single person or stretcher is unqualified!"

    翻身后的丰年
    十月二十日早上，我们从昌图城（属辽西省）到大房身堡子屯去。太阳刚冒红，农家房舍上冒着一缕缕的炊烟。大原野上排着已割下的庄稼，结结实实地站着队，像一群结实的小伙子。还没有收割的高粱、谷子的沉重的穗子，被小风吹得幌头幌脑。在我们眼前是一幅壮丽的丰收图。配着咕?沽?的车轮声，我们骄傲地唱起来了：
    我们祖国多么辽阔广大
    她有无数田野和……
    大房身堡子，约摸有三十几户人家。家家户户房前房后的场院上，磙子咯吱吱、咯吱吱地响着；一大垛一大垛的大豆、谷子、高粱，使房子都显得小了。须发花白的老大爷、满面红光的小伙子，在温暖的阳光下，堆垛、赶磙子、扬场，天真烂漫的孩子们，也在一旁凑热闹；他们瞧着生人来了，干得更上了劲。
    和村长、支书唠扯起今年的年景来，村长兴匆匆地说：“今年，可真是多少年没见过的好年头，你瞧瞧！”他指着村道上往来的老乡，“今年都反过乏了，腰板儿直起来了。那家的粮食，不是满仓满囤的？！”支书接过来说：“若是在前年（指未解放前），咱堡子连条狗都养活不起。现在谁家没有一条牙口正好的毛驴。这两天，大家还合计到省里去买车呢！”他叭嗒两口旱烟，接着伸出两个指头有劲地说：“再过两年，同志，你再来看！”村长把身子往前挪一步说：“人也真怪，往年懒得怕活咬手，如今，连茅楼里的粪都存不住。一到开春，谁家都怕地里上粪少；三铲三趟，侍弄得地里连根草刺都没有，这怎能不多打粮！同志，你瞧来年的吧！”
    一个穿着里面新的小花袄的小姑娘，蹦蹦跳跳地跑来说：“叫你们到劳模家吃饭去啦！”太阳压了山，屯子里一轰声地响起叫鸡、唤狗、哄笑喊话的声音。
    翻翻滚滚的抗美怒潮
    翻身的人们刚刚过到好日子，美帝国主义又张牙舞爪地扑来了。“保卫咱们的好光景，打垮美帝纸老虎！”抗美援朝保家卫国的怒潮，翻翻滚滚地高涨起来了。
    昌图县的农民，自动组织好几百付担架，坚决要去朝鲜参战。梨树县十二区李老大娘，非要求把她儿子编到第一批担架队里不可，还再三嘱咐儿子：“听队长的话，好好照顾负伤同志，不要像在家那样耍牛皮气。”好多区、村干部，为着抢先参加担架队而争争嚷嚷。四家子村一个老大爷把亲手编的草垫子，背着送给村干部说：“这是我用新稻草编的，挺软和的，送给担架队，让他们抬伤员时一定铺上！”
    “挑选最好的粮食缴给国家，加强我们的国防力量！”老乡们在抗美援朝的热潮中，谁都有这股热劲。昌图五区一个老大爷把公粮选了又选，挑了又挑，连一个草星、杂瓣也没有。他说：“上年纪了，不能抬担架，挑好籽粒送公粮，还顶一个！赶早送好公粮，就顶打美国强盗。”好多复员军人，都喊着重返战场，不断溜的跟地方政府提出要求。昌图够窝村一个荣誉军人，身体虽不太好，但他坚决参加了担架队，还当了小队长。大房身一个劳动模范说：“国民党在这时，家家连个小鸡子都养不住。那群黄狼子，有本事偷小鸡，一打仗就爬墙头、穿兔子鞋。美国兵和“种殃军”是一个模子脱的坯，咱们怕啥，不打死它还留着它？！”
    农民的胜利果实，谁也抢不去！他们在毛主席、共产党的领导下，团结得像钢像铁。“非把美国强盗砸个稀糊烂不可！”昌图五区一个老乡在担架大会上说的话，代表了千千万万农民的决心。
    人民力量的检阅
    十月二十三日，亮甲桥区举行人民力量的大检阅。人们像赶大集似地往上涌，把亮甲桥村挤了个风丝不透。担架杆像朝天的炮身，草席卷像包扎未动的炮弹。参加检阅的老乡，都穿着崭新的青棉衣、新乌拉。小伙子一个比一个棒，排得齐齐整整。每个人的脸，被太阳晒得光闪闪的。午前十一点钟，大检阅开始了。在一阵阵的巴掌声中，吴同志说明了抗美援朝的伟大意义，并对担架、行军锅和队员的身体、服装进行了仔仔细细的检查后向大伙宣布：“大家志愿抗美援朝的热情太高了，我向大家道喜：检阅的结果，没有一个人、一副担架不合格的！”
