    Li Shunda After the National Model Worker Conference
    Huo Chengxun
    Labor Model is Truly Glorious
    Li Shunda, the nationally renowned agricultural labor model, received a warm welcome from the people along the way when he returned from the National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Labor Models. In Hero Street, Changzhi County, more than 10,000 people welcomed him. In 1946, Li Shunda also received a warm welcome from the people here at the Taihang Second Heroes Congress. In the past, the working people, like him, were cruelly exploited by the landlord ruling class, and they only turned over under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Therefore, they regarded the glory of the labor model as their own glory. The people of Ping顺 felt even more honored for the return of the labor model from their county. More than 3,000 people in the county, and all the county's labor models who were meeting, welcomed him with gongs and drums three miles away. On this day, Li Shunda's wife was also at home preparing to welcome her glorious husband. The welcoming people all happily said: It's more glorious for a person who has suffered to reach such a state than passing the imperial examination in the past.
  
  Not Forgetting Chairman Mao's Words
    Li Shunda participated in the county's labor model meeting without going home. In addition to carrying out inspection and discussion with everyone, he also reported in detail to everyone about his participation in the National Labor Model Congress. First of all, he told his close comrades-in-arms what Chairman Mao had instructed about building a strong economic force and a strong national defense force. Chairman Mao's words, like seeds, were sown by him among every advanced farmer, and they would grow and strengthen soon. He also described in detail how he met the healthy Chairman Mao, how he reviewed the great strength of the motherland on National Day, how he attended the banquet at the Soviet Embassy, ​​feeling the greatness and closeness of Sino-Soviet friendship, and how he saw the modernized agricultural machinery when he visited the machine farm. He also gave a report to the winter school volunteer teachers who were being trained, so that they could convey the above situation to the vast number of peasant brothers. This is the best and most precious gift he brought back to everyone, and also the one that everyone welcomed the most.
  
  Leading the Masses to Universally Autumn Plow
    At the National Labor Model Congress, Chairman Mao called on every labor model: Do not be arrogant and complacent; give play to the role of backbone, leader, and bridge. In fact, Li Shunda was walking the road indicated by Chairman Mao. After listening to Chairman Mao's call, he became even more clear that he should implement it into practical action.
    After returning to the village from the county labor model meeting, he didn't rest at all, he took off the new clothes he was awarded at the National Labor Model Congress and started working "seriously." At that time, it was late autumn, and in the mountainous Ping顺, the climate already had a winter chill, and in the morning, the shady areas were already frozen. But the cornfields had not yet been plowed. If they didn't hurry up at this time, the first plowing couldn't be completed. Therefore, Li Shunda, who was both a labor model and the village party secretary, first convened a branch meeting and made a mobilization. After the meeting, under his leadership, they rushed for more than ten days, and by the time he attended the Provincial Labor Model Congress, the village's more than 400 mu of autumn land had basically completed the plan of plowing once; some had even plowed twice.
  
  At the Provincial Labor Model Congress
    At the first Shanxi Provincial Congress of Workers and Agricultural Labor Models held in November, Li Shunda was elected as a first-class labor model. Xigou Village, which he led to organize and turn from poor to rich, was also selected as one of the provincial model villages. The leaders of the Party and the government personally awarded him medals, good news reports, and portraits of leaders. In addition, he himself and the whole village received a reward of a cow and many new liberation-style agricultural tools. This added convenience for him to lead the farmers in the village to carry out scientific farming in the future. But he knew that the glorious title of "labor model" was the most important reward, and at the same time, he also understood why he could get such a reward today, and also knew how to maintain and cherish the honor bestowed by the motherland and the people.
    At the Provincial Labor Model Congress, he not only introduced his own experience, but also humbly learned from other labor models. For example, the spirit of industrial labor models in studying and creating, and the experience of agricultural and cooperative labor models in improving technology, combining cooperatives with mutual aid groups, and developing forestry and animal husbandry in large quantities, all gave him great inspiration. He said: "It is not enough to turn a poor ditch into a rich ditch, we must become richer and make barren mountains become treasure mountains."
    Li Shunda has become a banner of rural production in Shanxi Province. Every farmer and agricultural labor model who attended the conference regarded him as an example to learn from. Labor models from Lingshi and other counties were happy to say when they saw him: "We all learn from you!" They either said that they had already posted the picture of me turning your poor village into a rich village, or that they had already bought the book of your democratic family. The workers also felt that Li Shunda was amiable and respectable, and the Taiyuan Flour Company specially invited him to give a report.
    But Li Shunda is becoming more and more humble. This is the driving force for eternal progress. After the labor models watched his model deeds in the slide film and the exhibition hall, and listened to his introduction of leadership experience, they all enthusiastically praised: Old Li! It's really not easy! But he replied: It's still far from enough, now it's just enough to eat and wear, to have a happy time, we have to work harder.
  
  Sowing the Seeds of Patriotic Production Competition
    Li Shunda, precisely because he is a labor model, he is also a true patriot. When the autumn plowing was about to end, U.S. imperialism frantically expanded its war of aggression against Korea and advanced towards the northeast border of our country, so he led the mutual aid groups in the village to hold current affairs discussions, so that everyone realized the essence of U.S. imperialism and the relationship between China and Korea, and that defending the country means defending the homeland, and increasing production means increasing national defense. First of all, he set an example and promoted the whole group and the whole village to formulate a winter production plan to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, and proposed a patriotic production competition to the farmers of the whole county and the whole province. At the Provincial Labor Model Congress, Li Shunda, together with Guo Yu'en and Yang Shanfeng, two first-class agricultural labor models from this county, challenged the labor models of the whole province. The conditions are: to do a good job in winter production, and to further improve production in 1951; to be a good propagandist, to publicize current affairs to the masses, and to turn the anti-American sentiment of the masses into practical actions to strengthen production, etc. His call was quickly responded to by the labor models and the vast number of farmers in the province. Zhang Zhiquan, Sun Chengyin, Zhang Zhitai, Wang Dianjun and others, well-known agricultural labor models in the Yuci Special Zone, representing Dazhai Village in Yushe County, Zhangba Village in Zuoquan County, Sanjiaohe Village and Baiyangyu Village in Xiyang County, immediately responded to Li Shunda's challenge, and also challenged the agricultural labor models in the province. All the provincial labor models in the Xingxian, Yuncheng, and Linfen special zones also responded to the call and enthusiastically launched a production competition. Many mutual aid groups in Jincheng, Zuoquan, and Huoxian counties have also been involved in this great movement. Especially in Li Shunda's hometown—Pingshun County, the movement has been carried out more widely. At present, doing a good job in winter production has become the goal of the competition movement in the whole of Shanxi.

    全国劳模会议后的李顺达
    霍成功
    劳动模范真光荣
    闻名全国的农业劳模李顺达，从全国工农兵劳模代表会议回来时，途中受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎。在长治县的英雄街上，欢迎他的群众就有一万多人。一九四六年，太行二届群英大会时，李顺达也曾在这里受到过广大人民的欢迎。劳动人民和他一样，过去都是受着地主统治阶级的残酷剥削，在毛主席和共产党的领导下才翻了身。因此，他们是把劳模的光荣也当成了自己的光荣。平顺的人民，对他们本县的劳模归来更觉得荣幸。该县三千多群众和正在开会的全县劳模，敲锣打鼓一直迎到三里地以外的地方。这天，李顺达的妻子也在家里准备迎接光荣的丈夫。欢迎的人们都高兴地说：受苦的人能有这样的地步，真比过去中状元还光荣。
  不忘毛主席的话
    李顺达没有回家就参加了县的劳模会议。他除了同大家一起进行检查和讨论外，并向大家详细地报告了参加全国劳模大会的情况。他首先把毛主席嘱咐的建立强大的经济力量，建立强大的国防力量的话，告诉给他这些亲密的战友。毛主席的话就象种籽一样，通过他播种到每个先进的农民中间去，并将在不久，就会成长壮大起来。他又详细介绍了如何会见到健康的毛主席，国庆日如何检阅了祖国的伟大力量，如何参加苏联大使馆的宴会，感到中苏友谊的伟大和亲密，以及参观机器农场所看到的近代化的农业机器等情形。他还向正在集训的冬学义务教员作了报告，让他们把上述情况传达到广大农民兄弟中去。这就是他给大家带回的、也是大家所最欢迎的最好的宝贵礼物。
  领导群众普遍秋耕
    在全国劳模大会上，毛主席号召每个劳模：不要骄傲自满；要发挥骨干、带头和桥梁作用。实际上，李顺达也就是走着毛主席所指示的道路。他听了毛主席的号召后，更加明确地要贯彻到实际行动中去。
    开完县劳模会回村后，他一点都没休息，就把在全国劳模会上奖给他的新衣服换掉，“着着实实”地干了起来。当时正是秋末，在多山的平顺，气候已有冬意，早晨，背阴地便已结冰。但玉茭地还没犁。这时如再不抓紧，头遍也不能犁完。因此，又是劳模又是村支书的李顺达，首先召开了支部会议，做了动员。会后，在他的带头和领导下，突击了十多天，到他出席省劳模会时，全村四百多亩秋地，便基本上完成了普耕一遍的计划；有的并耕了两遍。
  在省劳模大会上
    十一月召开的山西全省首届工农业劳模大会上，李顺达当选了一等劳动模范。在他领导下组织起来由穷变富的西沟村，也被选为全省模范村之一。党和政府的首长亲自授给他奖章、喜报和领袖像。此外，他自己和全村又得到一条牛和很多解放式新式农具的奖励。这给他今后领导全村农民进行科学的耕作增加了便利条件。但他知道，“劳动模范”的光荣称号，就是最主要的奖励，同时他也了解为什么今天能获得了这样的奖励，也知道如何保持和珍贵祖国与人民所赐予的这种荣誉。
    在省劳模大会上，他不仅介绍了自己的经验，并向其他劳模虚心学习。如工业劳模钻研创造的精神，和农业及合作劳模改进技术、合作社与互助组结合、大量发展林牧等经验，都给了他很大的启示。他说：“穷沟变富沟不能算完，要富了更富，使荒山变成宝山。”
    李顺达已成了山西全省农村生产上的一面旗帜。每个农民以及参加大会的农业劳模都把他当成了学习的榜样。灵石等县的劳模见到了他，都高兴地说：“我们大家都向你学习！”他们不是说我把你的穷村变富村的画早贴起来，就是说你的民主家庭的书我早买下了。工人们也都感到李顺达可亲可敬，太原面粉公司特别邀请他去作了一次报告。
    但李顺达是愈来愈虚心了。这是永远前进的动力。劳模们从幻灯影片和展览馆中看了他的模范事迹，和听了他介绍领导经验之后，都热烈称赞：老李！真不简单！但他回答道：还差得很远，现在只是够吃够穿，要过幸福时光，还得更加努力。
  撒下爱国主义生产竞赛的种籽
    李顺达，正因为他是劳动模范，所以他也是真正的爱国主义者。当秋耕将要结束时，美帝疯狂扩大侵朝战争，向我东北边境推进，于是他便领导全村互助组进行了时事座谈，使大家认识了美帝的本质和中朝关系，以及保卫国家就是保卫家乡、增加生产就是增加国防的道理。首先他以身作则，推动全组和全村，订出了抗美援朝、保家卫国的冬季生产计划，并向全县和全省农民提出爱国主义的生产竞赛。省劳模会上，李顺达又同本县郭玉恩、杨山峰两位一等农业劳模，向全省劳模挑战。条件是：搞好冬季生产，把一九五一年生产再提高一步；作一个好宣传员，向群众宣传时事，使群众把仇美情绪变为加强生产的实际行动等。他的号召，迅速得到全省劳模和广大农民的响应。著名的榆次专区农业劳模张志全、孙成寅、张志太、王殿俊等，代表榆社县大寨村、左权县丈八村、昔阳县三教河村、白羊峪村四个模范村，立即向李顺达应战，同时也向全省农业劳模提出挑战。兴县、运城、临汾专区的全体省劳模，也都响应号召，热烈展开了生产竞赛。晋城、左权、霍县等县不少互助组也卷入了这一伟大的运动。特别是在李顺达的故乡——平顺县，运动开展得更为普遍。目前搞好冬季生产已经成了全山西竞赛运动的努力目标。
