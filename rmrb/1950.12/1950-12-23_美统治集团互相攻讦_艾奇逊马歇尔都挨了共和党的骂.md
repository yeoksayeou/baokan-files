Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Due to the defeat in Korea, the infighting within the US imperialist ruling clique has recently fallen upon Acheson and even Marshall. Republican members of the US House and Senate held a vote on the 14th and overwhelmingly passed a recommendation to replace Acheson and "thoroughly clean up" the State Department. Only ten of the 125 Republican members of the House of Representatives opposed the motion, and only five Republican senators opposed it. Republican Senator Brewster even suggested Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson as a replacement for Acheson. This kind of blame for Acheson also comes from the Democratic side. Democratic Senator Kefauver said, "Things have been really messed up in Korea. MacArthur has to take some responsibility, and the State Department also has to take some responsibility." According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 17th, these people attacked Acheson because of "military setbacks in Korea, especially the fact that a large portion of the US military has been indefinitely tied down in Korea." At the same time that Acheson was being scolded, the position of Secretary of Defense Marshall also appeared unstable. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 18th, Washington has been rumored for some time that Marshall, who replaced Johnson as Secretary of Defense a few months ago to salvage the defeat on the Korean battlefield, will "resign" and be replaced by former Air Force Secretary Symington. This situation of mutual recrimination is so serious that Truman had to come forward to support Acheson and Marshall. He refused to replace Acheson and also denied considering Symington to replace Marshall, because Truman himself knew that neither Acheson, Marshall, nor Symington or Vinson could reverse the current US military and political failures. Truman said, "I don't know what improvement Acheson's retirement would make to our position in the world." Truman attempted to gain the understanding of the reactionaries with Acheson's thoroughly reactionary nature, saying, "If communism rules the world," "even if Acheson is not the first person to be shot by the enemy, he will definitely be among the first." But the attacks by Republican members of Congress have not stopped. Senate Republican Leader Wiley claimed that Truman's determination to retain Acheson was "a blow to national unity."

    美统治集团互相攻讦
    艾奇逊马歇尔都挨了共和党的骂
    【新华社二十一日讯】由于在朝鲜败战而引起的美帝统治集团内部的攻讦，最近又落到艾奇逊甚至马歇尔头上。美国众参两院共和党议员于十四日举行投票，以绝大多数通过建议，要求撤换艾奇逊并“彻底打扫”国务院。众院一百二十五名共和党议员中只有十人反对，参院共和党议员中也只有五人反对。共和党参议员布鲁斯特甚至提出最高法院院长文生来代替艾奇逊。这种对艾奇逊的责难也来自民主党方面。民主党参议员克福沃说：“在朝鲜，真是搞得乱七八糟。麦克阿瑟要负一部分责任，国务院也要负一部责任。”据合众社华盛顿十七日电透露，这些人攻击艾奇逊的原因是“朝鲜军事失利，特别是这造成美国一大部分的军队无限期地被牵制在朝鲜”。和艾奇逊被谩骂同时，国防部长马歇尔的地位也呈现不稳。据法新社十八日电，华盛顿方面若干时日以来即谣传：数月前代替詹逊出任国防部长职以挽回朝鲜战场上败局的马歇尔将“辞职”，而由前空军部长薛明顿来代替。这种互相攻讦情况是这样严重，以致杜鲁门不得不出场为艾、马撑腰。他拒绝撤换艾奇逊，也否认考虑以薛明顿代替马歇尔，因为杜鲁门自己也知道，不管艾奇逊、马歇尔，或者薛明顿、文生，都无法挽回目前美国在军事上、政治上的失败。杜鲁门说：“我不知道艾奇逊的退休会使我们在全世界所处的地位有什么改进。”杜鲁门企图以艾奇逊的反动彻骨来取得反动派的谅解，他说：“假使共产主义统治了全世界”，“艾奇逊纵然不是第一个被敌人枪毙的人，也必然是第一批里面的一个。”但是共和党议员们的攻击仍未停止，参院共和党领袖惠利称，杜鲁门决心保留艾奇逊是“对全国团结的打击”。
