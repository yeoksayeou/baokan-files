    Expose Austin's Lies!
    The True Face of American Imperialism During Our Country's War of Resistance Against Japan
    Dai Yi
    On November 28th, the American representative Austin delivered a lengthy speech at the Security Council, fabricating a pile of lies and shamelessly listing so-called "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people," attempting to prove that American imperialism "is not a bloody aggressor." He even brazenly mentioned that during our people's War of Resistance Against Japan, "the United States continued to express extremely serious concern about Japan's aggression against China," which "led to the Pearl Harbor incident." Very well! Let us open the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan and see what American imperialism did during the war against Japan? How did the U.S. truly "seriously care" about Japan's invasion of China? Was the Pearl Harbor incident caused by this? History is the fairest judge, it possesses its own irrefutable logic, and will immediately refute Mr. Austin, who is accustomed to reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, so that he is utterly discredited.
    American Imperialism Helped Japan Invade China
    The historical course of the War of Resistance Against Japan is precisely the opposite of what Austin said. From the September 18th Incident in 1931, through the outbreak of the Great War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1941, until the end of the War of Resistance in 1945, American imperialism consistently and actively supported the Japanese fascists' aggression against China, acting as the most vicious accomplice in the massacre of the Chinese people. On the surface, American imperialism pretended to be "neutral" and "non-interfering," and verbally chanted a whole set of hypocritical words that are still repeatedly abused by the likes of Truman, Acheson, and Austin, such as "maintaining peace," "adhering to international agreements," and "promoting world economic security." Of course, we Chinese people have heard enough of this "sweet talk" from American imperialism, but the Chinese people are a nation accustomed to "observing their actions after listening to their words." Let us look at the actions of American imperialism, and we will know what the true face hidden under the mask of so-called "neutrality" and "non-interference" really is.
    During the ten years from the September 18th Incident to the Pearl Harbor Incident, various statistical materials tell us that the military supplies that the United States shipped to Japan increased year by year, becoming the main supplier of war materials for the Japanese fascists. As early as the year of the September 18th Incident, American imperialism began to subsidize Japan's military materials on a large scale. In that year, the United States' trade with Japan changed from a deficit to a surplus. In the following six years, the United States accounted for 45 percent of Japan's foreign military trade. After 1937, under the notorious "cash and carry" act, the amount of supplies shipped to Japan increased year by year. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 1940, the ratio of American military supplies trade to Japan was 33.5 percent in 1937, 34.3 percent in 1938, 34.3 percent in early 1939, and suddenly increased to 38.7 percent in March 1940. After 1940, according to the American White Paper, which tried its best to tout "friendship with China," "the amount of oil, scrap iron and other war potential materials shipped to Japan gradually decreased." However, in fact, until the Pearl Harbor Incident, the war materials that the United States shipped to Japan had not decreased. According to publicly available statistical materials from 1940, the war materials that the United States shipped to Japan in that year still amounted to a huge sum of US$206,388,000. The great revolutionary teacher Lenin pointed out at the Second World Congress of the Communist International in 1920: Japan has the possibility of plundering Eastern countries and Asian countries, but without the assistance of other countries, it does not have the financially and militarily independent strength. Those who actively supported Japan's invasion of China at that time were precisely the American imperialist financial groups who are trying to prove that they are "friends of the Chinese people" today. Without their support, the Japanese fascists would not have dared to launch a large-scale war of aggression, and they would not have been able to sustain the war of aggression for as long as four and a half years. (After the Pearl Harbor Incident, Japan was able to continue the war for more than three and a half years because it had already seized resources from Southeast Asia.)
    As for the types of military supplies that the United States supplied to Japan: According to statistics from the China Economic Research Association in Washington in 1938, the proportion of military supplies shipped to Japan by various countries in the world in that year, coal tar and petroleum products accounted for 65.57 percent; the metal industry and machinery accounted for 77.09 percent; steel and scrap iron accounted for 90.39 percent; copper accounted for 90.39 percent; aircraft and parts accounted for 76.92 percent; semi-finished steel products accounted for 53.67 percent; automobiles and parts accounted for 64.67 percent; metal alloys accounted for 99.33 percent. Among them, for example, in the item of steel, the amount shipped from the United States to Japan in 1936 was 54,000 tons, but it suddenly increased to 880,000 tons in 1937, which is an increase of 16 times. In the item of kerosene, Japan's domestic production was only enough for 10 percent of its needs. 70 percent of the 40 million tons of gasoline consumed in the three years after the invasion of China was supplied by the United States. It can be seen that the United States almost took over the supply of various murderous weapons needed for Japan's invasion of China, and in particular, major war materials such as steel, scrap iron, alloys, copper, and kerosene were almost all supplied by the United States.
    American imperialism not only supplied Japan with a large amount of war materials, but also directly helped Japan establish a modern military industry, solving various technical and economic difficulties in Japan's military industry. Japan's famous Ayukawa Yoshisuke military industry was built up by the United States single-handedly. American companies such as Ford and Holtson supplied Ayukawa's "South Manchuria Railway Corporation" with modern metallurgical technology, making it the "King of the Steel Industry" in Japan, solving a considerable part of the needs of Japan's heavy industry; the American Rockefeller consortium also helped establish Ayukawa's new-style electrified oil extraction industry in North Sakhalin; the aircraft manufacturing industry of Japan's Nakajima consortium completed its modern technological scale with the help of American Mellon Corporation and Ford; the shipbuilding technology and aluminum manufacturing technology of Mitsubishi were also improved with the help of the United States. Especially in the heavy chemical industry, Japan already had considerable equipment in this area, and it was expected that various chemical industrial products could be supplied domestically. However, the war caused a huge new demand for these industrial products, and new factory equipment was urgently needed after 1937. Where could more readily available things be utilized? Thus, American imperialism descended on Japan with Austin-style "serious concern." "Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation" shipped the entire set of equipment for a gas manufacturing factory to Japan; "Monsanto Chemical Company" sold the entire set of equipment for a sulfuric acid plant to Japan; "Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation" even supplied Japan with its own patented "Schüllner" type machines. The care that the United States gave to the Japanese fascists can truly be said to be "meticulous." In the spring of 1939, the Pittsburgh United Engineering & Foundry Co. and Tokyo's Shibaura Machine Works simply merged their operations, with American investment in the plant reaching 49 percent, and providing the plant with a large number of technical and management personnel. According to a report in the Times at the time, the factory's machines were more advanced than those sold to Japan by Germany, and the establishment of this new factory could supply most of Japan's steel production needs.
    Look at this "the United States continues to express extremely serious concern about Japan's aggression against China!" Austin's forte is to avoid talking about the facts, trying his best to distort and fabricate history, and singing beautiful phrases about "friendship with China." However, the eyes of the Chinese people are sharp, and we clearly recognize who is a friend and who is an enemy. Historical facts and statistics expose Austin's shameless lies and lead to his utter bankruptcy.
    The Contradictions of American Imperialism's Far East Policy
    So, why did American imperialism so frantically supply the Japanese fascists with a large number of murderous weapons and help it build a military industry? Of course, we cannot hope that Mr. Austin will utter a single word about this, but a much more honest Senator Schwellenbach from Washington once confessed frankly in October 1939: "We say that Japan has two allied countries, Germany and Italy. In fact, we are Japan's best ally. Anyone will undoubtedly believe that we are actively participating in the war that Japan is conducting in China." This Mr. Schwellenbach confessed with a degree of candor that Austin should be twelve thousand times ashamed of, saying: "Japan sends out soldiers, but our lives are not in any danger in the war. We only transport goods and raw materials to Japan so that they can use them to fight, and we make profits from it." Look! "Making profits," this is the entire secret of American imperialism.
    If we further examine the situation in the Far East at that time, we can more clearly see the intentions of the United States in subsidizing Japan. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the forces of American imperialism in China had been expanding rapidly, they had not yet had time to grasp the hegemony of the Chinese economy. At that time, the U.S. policy toward China was still to sing "open door, equal opportunity," using the military power of Japanese imperialism to open up the spheres of influence of various countries that had been roughly delineated in China, so that Japan and China would weaken each other in the war, in order to allow itself to further intervene in China. This was the highest "interest" of the American imperialists. Comrade Stalin once profoundly analyzed the essence of the non-interference policy in the concluding report of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1939. He pointed out: "The policy of non-intervention reveals an eagerness, a desire, not to hinder the aggressors in doing their dirty work—not to hinder Japan, say, from embroiling herself in a war with China, or, better still, with the Soviet Union; not to hinder Germany, say, from bogging herself in European affairs, from embroiling herself in a war with the Soviet Union; to allow all the belligerents to sink deeply into the mire of war; to encourage them surreptitiously in this; to allow them to weaken and exhaust one another; and then, when they have become weak enough, to appear on the scene with fresh strength, to appear, of course, 'in the interests of peace,' and to dictate conditions to the enfeebled belligerents. Cheap and easy!"
    However, the cheap and easy deal could not be done very smoothly. The Japanese fascists had their own plans. They did not become entangled in the war against the Soviet Union as the U.S. had hoped. Under the intimidation of the great power of the Soviet Red Army, Japanese imperialism did not dare to rashly invade the Soviet Union, but instead advanced into the Chinese mainland, threatening the "interests" of American imperialism in China, which were rapidly growing. As a result, it induced the growth of contradictions between the United States and Japan.
    On the one hand, it supplied Japan with a large amount of war materials, and on the other hand, it diligently guarded against Japan's infringement on its own Far East "interests." This was the contradiction in the Far East policy of American imperialism at that time. Mr. Austin may never reveal this point, but an American writer named David Cohn exposed this contradiction in the Atlantic Monthly as early as November 1937. He wrote:
    "If Japan continues to invade and conquer China, do we sell goods to Japan? Yes.
    Suppose every American sympathizes with China, do we change our current policy? No, even if all the countries in the world are ravaged by the hungry, the plundering, or the warmongering countries, it is irrelevant to us.
    Does the United States have a major conflict of rights with China? No.
    Does it have one with Japan? Yes.
    …………
    If Japan conquers China, can it powerfully conflict with the rights of the United States in the Far East? Yes.
    Does Japan have the freedom to buy things in the American market during wartime, which helps Japan conquer China? It helps.
    Is China unable to trade with the United States during wartime, which hinders China's self-defense? It hinders.
    …………
    What is the practical impact of our current policy on the Sino-Japanese War? It is clearly helping the powerful and aggressive militarist people to conquer the weak and peace-loving non-militarist people. We have built a huge navy to oppose this military country; all its policies are constantly in conflict with us; we jealously guard against its rise; we are very suspicious of its ambitions; we cannot believe what it says; and our relations with it have always been only polite and not cordial. It is not in our interest if it conquers China. But we are now helping such a military country."
    It was precisely because the American financial groups were blinded by the frenzy of seeking arms profits, and were willing to risk the danger of war rather than stop or reduce the supply of military materials to Japan, that they supported Japan's long-term large-scale war against China.
    American Imperialism Supports Chiang Kai-shek and Conspires to Compromise with Japan
    After Japan occupied the Northeast, it did not attack the Soviet Union according to the wishes of the United States, but instead spread the war of aggression to North and Central China. The armed forces of Japan directly hit the economic "interests" of the United States in China, which could not but make the United States "express serious concern." At that time, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, had risen up to fight a desperate struggle with the Japanese aggressors. American imperialism wanted to use the resistance of the Chinese people to frustrate the arrogant arrogance of the Japanese aggressors, but at the same time, American imperialism clearly understood that the raging flames of the great Chinese national liberation war would not only burn to death Japanese imperialism, but also burn to death all imperialisms that invaded China. Therefore, the United States needed a puppet regime that would neither publicly surrender to Japan nor suppress the internal people's revolution in China. This is the real reason why the U.S. supported the Chiang Kai-shek government. At that time, American financial groups loaned Chiang Kai-shek money under various names, eight times in total, amounting to a huge sum of US$297 million, and sent a large number of "experts" to participate in the work of Chiang Kai-shek's political, military, aviation, railway, transportation, finance, and currency exchange departments, maintaining Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Perhaps Austin will again interpret these actions as "noble moral responsibilities," but the Chinese people are very clear that this is not a "moral responsibility," this is precisely the aggressive "responsibility" of American imperialism to further enslave China, precisely the active measures of American imperialism to compete for rights and interests in China with Japanese fascists and other imperialist countries, precisely the specific steps of American imperialism to suppress the Chinese people's revolution. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek received American aid, which was not spent on the battlefield against Japan, but on the blockade of the Chinese democratic anti-Japanese liberation areas. The United States helped Chiang Kai-shek to blockade the liberated areas; Chiang Kai-shek, under "tears of gratitude," presented the Chinese currency management rights, the operating rights of aircraft factories near Xikang and Kunming, the right to establish airports in various parts of the southwest, the right to lay the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and even the special right to "review Chiang Kai-shek's military strategy" to the United States in one go, even squeezing out the privileges of the old-brand British Empire. The plans of American imperialism are indeed very clever. China and Japan fight, and they obtain privileges and profits from both China and Japan; American power grows, and Japanese power weakens; the Chinese people's liberated areas are blockaded, and Britain and France are excluded. At a certain time, they themselves emerge from the mask of "non-interference," order China and Japan to disarm, and sacrifice China's war of resistance to achieve the goal of exclusively occupying China. What Austin boasted today as a sacred "moral responsibility" is just this!
    It was precisely because American imperialism held the goal of sacrificing China's war of resistance to achieve the goal of exclusively occupying China, that while it subsidized Japan's invasion of China and subsidized Chiang Kai-shek's blockade of the CCP, it also made every effort to carry out activities to compromise between Chiang and Japan. Less than half a month after the July 7th Incident broke out, U.S. Secretary of State Hull invited Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, and Japanese Ambassador Saito to meet, expressing that the United States "felt great concern" about the outbreak of war between China and Japan, and was willing to "do its best for the cause of peace." On August 10 of the same year, the U.S. State Department issued an instruction to Ambassador Grew in Japan: "To informally suggest to the Japanese government that the United States mediate the solution of the disputes between China and Japan, in this proposed plan, propose a neutral location where representatives of China and Japan can meet, conduct negotiations, and provide various assistance to adjust the difficulties that may arise in the negotiations." This was an evil conspiracy by American imperialism to place China and Japan under its own control at the same time in order to conclude an agreement to divide China. However, at that time, the anti-Japanese sentiments of the Chinese people were extremely high, which dealt a blow to this conspiracy of the United States; at the same time, Japan did not respond to this proposal, which turned the illusion of the United States into a bubble.
    After that, the United States did not abandon this activity of speculation and profiteering. After the fall of Wuhan and the War of Resistance entered a stalemate, the muddy legs of the Japanese fascist aggressors became more and more deeply mired in the Chinese mainland. They adopted a policy of "political offense as the mainstay and military offense as the supplement" against Chiang Kai-shek, inducing Chiang Kai-shek to surrender. American imperialism came forward and actively served as the main liaison for this inducement activity. If Austin is not pretending to be forgetful, then he should be able to recall the "constantly urging China to negotiate peace" Munich conspiracy in the East in 1939, in which the United States actively participated. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui made a statement to reporters, admitting that "the United States is most suitable to speak to Japan at this time." (Associated Press telegram, September 28, 1939). Kong Xiangxi also told American Maurer, who came to China for investigation, and asked him to convey his greetings to the U.S. President, and was willing to have the United States come out to mediate. These activities later miscarried due to the firm opposition of the Chinese people and the excessively high asking price of the Japanese aggressors. Historical facts once again prove that the United States not only did not assist China's war of resistance, but also actively played a destructive role.
    How Did the Pearl Harbor Incident Break Out?
    So, what was the Pearl Harbor Incident all about? Was it really caused by "expressing serious concern about Japan's invasion of China" as Austin said? With a little review of history, we will never believe Austin's nonsense. The Pearl Harbor Incident was entirely caused by the conflict of interests between the United States and Japan in the Far East. In order to prevent historical facts from being distorted by Austin's lies, let us start with the outbreak of the European War.
    When the European War broke out in September 1939, the international situation took a sharp turn for the worse. In 1940, France and the Netherlands were finished, and Britain was hovering at the door of death. The colonies of these countries in the Far East became unguarded treasures. This situation stirred up the Japanese fascists and also stirred up the American financial groups. Japan first attacked and occupied Hainan Island in China, and deployed its "invincible fleet" in the South China Sea, posing a posture of attacking Southeast Asia. Then, it made demands on Britain, France, and the Netherlands, demanding that Britain block the Burma Road and conclude the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; demanding that the Netherlands "economic cooperation," and also sent a delegation to discuss oil issues with the Dutch East Indies; it was even more merciless to the completely collapsed French imperialism, first threatening the Vichy government to accept the "Japan-France Military Agreement" and the "Franco-Vietnamese-Japanese Joint Anti-Communist Agreement," and later simply sent Japanese troops into Vietnam, implementing armed occupation; Thailand, which was in a so-called "neutral" position between the two major powers, was also gradually drawn into Japan's "Co-prosperity Sphere."
    Japan wanted to take the opportunity to seize Southeast Asia, and the United States also wanted to take the opportunity to seize Southeast Asia, just as then U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Harold R. Stark, said: "The tense relationship between the U.S. and Japan has reached the point of breaking, and Japan's ambition for the rich land of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam is increasingly exposed." The United States' countermeasure was to firmly grasp Southeast Asia, control all resources, support Britain to reopen the Burma Road, and instigate the Netherlands to sell only a quarter of the oil production of the Dutch East Indies to Japan. This made the Japanese warlords cry out. Toshio Shimada said in a speech in the Japanese House of Representatives: "The group of hostile countries centered on the United States... interferes in Thailand's internal affairs, instigates the Dutch East Indies not to supply our country with necessary materials, strengthens the defense of the Pacific locations such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Hawaii, and makes useless threats... Things have come to this, there is no other way but to 'fight'. We hope that the government will concentrate on completing the war purpose."
    This is the real contradiction between the United States and Japan, and the real reason that caused the Pearl Harbor Incident. Austin distorts the war caused by the contradictions between imperialist countries as suffering for China. Who would believe this clumsy lie except to deceive themselves and the yes-men in the Security Council?
    There is also an important episode between 1940 and 1941 that must be described in order to clarify the details of how American imperialism sought to compromise with Japan before the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor Incident, but failed.
    The Japanese fascists grew up on the warm bed of American financial groups for a long time, so until the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, American imperialism had never thought that the Japanese would actually launch an armed attack on themselves. One of the U.S. Air Force generals defending Pearl Harbor gave a mysterious speech at a gathering five months before the Japanese attack, saying: "After we deal with the Germans, we can turn to the Japanese devils and say: 'Okay, okay, little brother, be good', and they will be good." (See "China's Storm," page 83) This feeling of contempt and intimacy for Japan permeated the American upper class at that time. Therefore, the U.S. government had always fantasized that the Japanese devils would listen to them, and had been seeking a way to compromise with Japan to solve the problems in the Far East.
    The American people had resolutely opposed this U.S.-Japan meeting that sold out China and Southeast Asia. Therefore, U.S. Secretary of State Hull had told Japanese Ambassador Nomura: "The current situation in the United States makes it by no means easy to conduct U.S.-Japan talks." But in fact, as early as around December 1940, the U.S. began secret activities with Japan to so-called "adjust U.S.-Japan relations," with U.S. Catholic Maryknoll College Bishop Walsh, General Secretary Don Rafferty, and U.S. Postmaster General Ubien, etc., secretly contacting Colonel Iwakuro and Tadao Ikawa of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau. By April 1941, this contact had gradually matured, becoming a secret negotiation between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura. On April 8, Hull proposed a draft of a "U.S.-Japan Understanding Plan," which included: the U.S. and Japan dividing the Pacific hegemony; requiring Japan to stop its military advance southward; the United States was willing to assist Japan in obtaining materials such as oil, rubber, tin, and nickel; stipulating commercial and financial mutual assistance between the U.S. and Japan; "and in order to promote economic cooperation between the two countries, the United States is willing to provide credit loans to Japan in order to improve the Asian economy, promote industry and commerce, and realize U.S.-Japan economic cooperation"; the following decisions were made on the China issue:
    "In order for the U.S. President to recognize the left-column conditions and to guarantee the Japanese government, he will advise 'the Chiang regime' (note: quotation marks are original, the same below) to make peace based on the left-column conditions; A, Chinese independence (?); B, according to the agreement established between China and Japan, the Japanese army will withdraw from Chinese territory; C, not annexing China; D, not demanding compensation; E, restoring the open door policy; F, merging 'the Chiang government' with 'the Wang government' (!); G, Japan will limit the large-scale or group immigration to China on its own; H, recognizing Manchukuo (!). When 'the Chiang regime' accepts the advice of the U.S. President, the Japanese government will regard the regime as establishing a unified new Chinese government..."
    From this document, we can see that on the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, American imperialism was still conducting compromise activities with Japan, even at the cost of cutting China's national revolution in half and sacrificing Northeast China in exchange for dividing the Far East hegemony with Japanese fascism, and in exchange for U.S.-Japan-Chiang-Wang cooperation. Now Austin explains these facts as "continuing to express serious concern about Japan's invasion of China," which is truly shameless to the extreme.
    However, Japanese imperialism was not satisfied with this plan, especially eliminating the phrase "stopping the military advance southward," and was unwilling to guarantee U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Therefore, Secretary of State Hull "expressed considerable doubt," and the negotiations were delayed. But American imperialism had not given up the idea of peaceful coexistence with Japanese fascism at this time, expressing its willingness to continue negotiations and make more concessions (for example, on the China issue). The famous appeasementist U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, also hoped that the U.S. President could have "a long talk of about three days" with Japanese war criminal leader Konoe, and "do everything possible to establish this foundation." (See Grew's "Return to Tokyo") Therefore, negotiations reopened in November 1941, and Japanese representatives Kurusu and Nomura jointly stepped into the White House, holding the first official U.S.-Japan meeting that attracted worldwide attention. From November 17 to December 5, a total of 14 meetings, including informal meetings, were held in a total of 20 days, reaching the highest peak of the U.S.-Japan negotiations. Hull also sought the opinions of British Ambassador Halifax, Australian Minister Casey, Dutch East Indies Minister Lunt, and Chiang Kai-shek's running dog Ambassador Hu Shih. The "26th proposal" put forward at the meeting, according to Hull's explanation: "Five out of the ten articles are beneficial to Japan," but Japanese fascists believed in force and did not accept the "good intentions" of the United States, and decided to launch an attack. Therefore, even a year after the start of the war, Ambassador Nomura, who participated in the negotiations, still regretted that "he had hurt Secretary of State Hull's feelings for us." (See Masao Mori, "Twenty Years of Whirlwind")
    "Remember Pearl Harbor," the American people have used this as a lesson. What does it teach the American people? It teaches the American people that they must rise up and resolutely oppose their government, and oppose the policy of supporting Japanese fascism and invading Asia, which is still unfortunately repeated by Truman today.
    After the Outbreak of the U.S.-Japan War, American Imperialism Further Invaded China
    "After the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States was always definitely helping China's war of resistance, right?" No! Absolutely not. Historical facts tell us that even after the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States still consistently wanted to turn China into its own exclusive colony, and never really helped China's war of resistance. Everyone knows that the United States supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of materials, gave Chiang Kai-shek a "financial loan" of US$500 million in 1942, and in the years from the spring of the same year, the leased materials flying over the Hump reached US$870 million. Later, Wei Demai gradually equipped 20 divisions of American-equipped Chiang army. But everyone also knows that these materials were not used to fight against the Japanese army, but to deal with the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. For example, the 20 American-equipped Chiang army divisions became the main capital for Chiang Kai-shek to launch the civil war later. This was frankly admitted by the American reactionary economist Babbson at the time: the first of the five tasks of the United States was to "prevent the Soviet Union from spreading communism in China, as the price of assisting China in resisting Japan and defending itself." Therefore, all the materials supplied to Chiang Kai-shek under the beautiful name of resisting Japan were to enable "Chiang to recuperate and prepare to deal with the Communist Party after the war." (Roosevelt's Secret Records, page 193)
    Obviously, the U.S.'s behavior of supporting Chiang against the Communist Party at that time was a concrete step in its consistent policy of aggression against China for the past 100 years. American imperialism deeply realized that in order to seize hegemony in the Pacific after the war, it must firmly grasp China in its hands. As early as after the September 18th Incident, Secretary of State Stimson revealed his "foresight" and ambition in a speech. He said: "Looking at the distant historical future, if we do not estimate the future possibilities with decades as the period, but with centuries as the period, then it is very clear that the important decision-maker of the future Pacific relations of the United States will be the 450 million Chinese people living on the mainland across the islands of Japan." Facts have proved that American imperialism has been following Stimson's creed for the 20 years from September 18th to today, and has been trying its best to turn China into a second Philippines in order to realize its dream of dominating Asia, dominating the Pacific, and then dominating the world.
    Just by recalling the Stilwell incident in the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we can better understand the intention of the U.S. to enslave China. In the spring of 1942, the United States sent Stilwell to serve as the commander of the China-Burma-India Theater. General Stilwell did not understand the essence of the U.S. policy toward China. Therefore, when he arrived in China, he criticized the chaos and corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government. He advocated uniting against Japan and advocated using the aid materials to China on the battlefield against Japan. "There is no reason why Chiang should keep a huge force in the north without moving, to vent his hatred for the Communist Party." (See "Stilwell's Diary") He even proposed to rely on the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to fight. He was of course strongly opposed by Chiang Kai-shek, and also opposed by Chennault, the commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force and a famous murderer, who was "loyal" to Wall Street's policy. "The 14th Air Force deliberately planned to devalue what I did, and made all kinds of absurd words," (See "Stilwell's Diary") "The discord between Chennault and Stilwell shook the entire U.S. military stationed in China. You are either Stilwell's people, or Chennault's people. It is as difficult as walking a tightrope to be equally friendly to the two people" (See "China's Storm"). When the U.S. government began to realize that Stilwell could not "faithfully" implement its policy toward China, it sent Willkie to persuade him to "be more tactful" (See "Stilwell's Diary"), but in the end, when the U.S. government completely realized that Stilwell was not suitable for carrying out the task of aggression against China, it simply dismissed him and replaced him with the "loyal" Hurley and Wei Demai.
    According to Hurley's statement, his mission to China was to: re-support the then-shaky Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, so he "said during his first visit to Chiang Kai-shek that the U.S. government had always been behind Chiang personally, and that the dispatch of the delegation this time was purely to rescue him and China. Chiang was very happy and immediately had a good impression of Hurley. Their friendship was thus born." (See "China's Storm")
    Without further explanation, after this, Hurley's "mediation" activities with aggressive intentions were all to achieve the goal of interfering in and enslaving China. In November 1944, Hurley held talks with the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an, and the two sides signed a five-point agreement on the establishment of a democratic coalition government and a joint command. However, the U.S. envoy, who did not keep his word, immediately tore up the agreement he signed after returning to Chongqing from Yan'an, and has since remained silent about it. It was not until after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan that the U.S. government vigorously helped Chiang Kai-shek seize the fruits of victory of the Chinese people, transported the Chiang army to the liberated areas, and instigated Chiang Kai-shek to carry out a large-scale civil war to massacre the Chinese people.
    The historical facts of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan teach us that American imperialism has always been the friend of the enemies of the Chinese people, and has always been the enemy of the Chinese people. It once subsidized the Japanese fascists' aggression against China; it once attempted to sacrifice China in order to compromise with Japan; it once instigated the bloody butcher Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the Chinese people. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the true face of American imperialism was just like this! Austin distorts all this as "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people," and everyone knows that he is just trying to whitewash the U.S. invasion of Korea today. We want to warn Austin, warn all the warmongers of American imperialism, that all the aggressive policies of the U.S. in the past have been met with tragic and shameful failure under the firm resistance of the Chinese people. Today, the Chinese people have stood up and are a hundred times stronger than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. If American imperialism is unwilling to accept its own failure and wants to attack China again, then they will only suffer a more tragic and more shameful failure.

    拆穿奥斯汀的谎话！            
    美帝国主义在我国对日抗战期间的真面目
    戴逸
    十一月二十八日，美国代表奥斯汀在安理会上发表了冗长的演说，捏造了一大堆谎话，恬不知耻地列举所谓“中美人民间友谊”的“史实”，力图证明美帝国主义“并不是血腥侵略者”，特别还厚颜地提到我国人民对日抗战期间“美国继续对日本侵略中国表示极严重的关怀”，“才招致了珍珠港事件”。好罢！让我们翻开抗日战争的历史，看看美帝国主义在对日战争期间干了些什么？美帝究竟如何“严重关怀”着日本对中国的侵略？是不是因此而引起了珍珠港事件？历史是最公正的评判者，它本身具有颠扑不破的逻辑，立刻会把这位惯于颠倒黑白，混淆是非的奥斯汀先生痛驳得体无完肤。
    美帝帮助日本侵略中国
    对日抗战的历史行程恰恰和奥斯汀所说的相反，自从一九三一年九一八事件以后，中间经历一九三七年伟大抗日战争的爆发，一九四一年珍珠港事件的爆发，一直到一九四五年抗战结束为止，美帝国主义一贯地积极支持日本法西斯对中国的侵略行动，充当屠杀中国人民最恶毒的帮凶。表面上，当时美帝国主义伪装着“中立”和“不干涉”，并在口头上高唱着一大套至今仍为杜鲁门、艾奇逊、奥斯汀辈反复滥用的“维持和平”“信守国际协定”“促进世界之经济安全”等等的虚伪言词。当然，美帝国主义的这种“甜言蜜语”，我们中国人民是听够了的，但中国人民是惯于“察其言而观其行”的民族，我们且来看看美帝国主义的行为，便会知道在所谓“中立”和“不干涉”的假面具下所隐藏着的真正面目是什么？
    自从九一八事件到珍珠港事件的十年中，各种统计材料告诉我们：美国输日的军事物资，逐年增加，成为日本法西斯战争物资的主要供给者。早在九一八那年，美帝国主义就开始大规模资助日本的军用物资，是年美国对日贸易即一变入超而为出超。在此后的六年中，美国占日对外军需贸易的百分之四十五。一九三七年后，在臭名远扬的“现购自运”法案下，输日物资更逐年增加，据一九四零年日本工商省统计，美国对日军需品贸易的比率，一九三七年为百分之三三·五，一九三八年为百分之三四·三，一九三九年初为百分之三四·三，一九四零年三月份即突增至百分之三八·七。一九四零年以后，据竭力吹嘘“对华友谊”的美国白皮书供称：“输往日本的油类、废铁及其他作战潜力物资逐渐减少”。但是，实际上直至珍珠港事件为止，美国输日的战争物资并没有减少过。据一九四零年公开的统计材料：该年美国输日的战争物资尚达二亿零六十三万八千美元之巨。伟大的革命导师列宁早在一九二零年共产国际第二次世界代表大会上指出：日本有了掠夺东方各国、亚细亚各国的可能，但是没有其他国家的援助，它就没有财政上和军事上独立的力量。当日积极支持日本侵华的，正是今天力图证明自己是“中国人民朋友”的美帝财阀们，没有他们的支持，日本法西斯还不敢发动大规模的侵略战争，并且也不能把侵略战争持续到四年半之久。（珍珠港事件后，日本又能继续战争三年半以上，是因为已经夺取了南洋的物资。）
    至于美国供给日本军需品的种类方面：根据一九三八年华盛顿中国经济研究协会统计：是年世界各国输日的军需物资，美国所占的比例，煤浊及石油产品为百分之六五·五七；金属工业及机器为百分之七七·○九；钢铁及废铁为百分之九○·三九；铜为百分之九○·三九；飞机及零件为百分之七六·九二；钢铁半制成品为百分之五三·六七；汽车及零件为百分之六四·六七；金属合金为百分之九九·三三。其中如钢铁一项，一九三六年由美国输日的为五万四千吨，一九三七年便陡增至八十八万吨，即增加了十六倍。煤油一项，日本本国产量只够所需百分之十，侵华战争后三年内所消耗的四千万吨汽油，百分之七十为美国所供给的。可见美国差不多包办了供给日本侵略中国所需的各种杀人武器，而特别是钢铁、废铁、合金、铜、煤油等主要作战物资几乎全部为美国所供给。
    美帝不但以大量战争物资供给日本，并且直接帮助日本建立起近代化的军事工业，解决日本军需工业在技术上及经济上的种种困难。日本著名的鲇川义介军需工业就是美国一手扶植起来的，美国福特公司与霍特森公司供给鲇川“满铁株式会社”以现代化的冶金技术，使它成为日本“钢铁工业之王”，解决了日本重工业相当大的需要；美国洛克菲勒财阀还帮助建立了鲇川军需财阀在北库页岛的新式电气化采油工业；日本中岛财阀的飞机制造业是在美国梅隆公司及福特公司的帮助下才完成了近代化技术的规模；三菱财伐的造船技术和制铝技术也是美帝帮助改良的。特别在重化学工业方面，日本原来已有这方面的相当设备，预计各种化学工业品可以由国内自给，但是战争引起对这项工业品的巨大新需要，一九三七年后新的工厂设备需要得十分迫切，那里有更现成的东西可以利用呢？于是美帝国主义带着奥斯汀式的“严重关切”态度降临到日本了。“联合碳化物和碳氧公司”把瓦斯制造工厂的全付机器输往日本；“门圣多化学公司”把一个硫酸工场的全部机器卖给日本；“同盟化学颜料公司”连自己专利的“梳尔惠”式机器也供给日本了，美国对日本法西斯的照顾，真可以说是“无微不至”。一九三九年春匹兹堡联合机械铸造厂与日本东京的芝浦机械厂更干脆地合并经营，美国对该厂的投资达百分之四十九，并供给该厂大批的技术人才与管理人才。据当时泰晤士报报道：该厂机器比德国卖给日本的还要新式，而且这一新厂的建立，可供日本钢铁生产的大部需要。
    看看这些“美国继续对日本侵略中国表示极严重的关怀”罢！奥斯汀的拿手好戏便是避开事实不谈，竭力歪曲与捏造历史，高唱什么“对华友谊”的漂亮词句，但是中国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，我们认得清楚谁是朋友，谁是敌人。历史事实和统计数字揭穿了奥斯汀的无耻谎话而使之遭到了彻底的破产。
    美帝远东政策的矛盾
    那么，美帝国主义为什么要那样疯狂地供给日本法西斯大量的杀人武器并帮助它建立军需工业呢？关于这一点我们当然不能希望从奥斯汀先生的嘴里吐露出片言只字，但是有一位比较诚实得多的华顿顿州参议员舒伟伦·巴枢先生曾经在一九三九年十月坦白供认：“我们说日本有德意两个同盟国，事实上我们才是日本最要好的盟国，任何人心里都会毫无疑问地相信，我们正在积极参加日本在华进行的战争。”这位巴枢先生更以奥斯汀应十二万分自惭不如的坦白程度供称：“日本派出士兵，而我们的性命在战争中却毫无危险，我们只把商品和原料运到日本，让他们用以作战，而我们则从中获得利润。”看罢！“获得利润”，这就是美帝国主义的全部秘密。
    我们再考察一下当时的远东局势，便更能清楚地看出美帝资助日本的企图。抗战以前，美帝国主义在华的势力虽已在迅速地扩充着，但还没有来得及掌握在华经济的霸权。当时，美帝对华政策还是高唱“门户开放，利益均沾”的时候，利用日本帝国主义的军事力量来打开在中国已经大致划定的各国势力范围，使日本和中国在战争中彼此削弱，以便使自己更进一步的插足中国，这便是美帝国主义者的最高“利益”。斯大林同志在一九三九年联共（布）十八次党代表大会的总结报告中曾经深刻地分析了不干涉政策的实质，他指出：“在不干涉政策中浸透有一种趋向，一种愿望，就是不妨碍侵略国去干它们的黑暗勾当，譬如说不妨碍日本纠缠于对华战争，更好是对苏战争；譬如说不妨碍德国陷落于欧洲事务和纠缠于对苏战争，让一切交战国都深深陷入战争深渊；暗中鼓励他们这样干；让它们彼此削弱，互相消耗；然后，当它们十分疲惫时，就带着新鲜力量出台活动，当然是‘为了和平’来出台活动，迫使那些精疲力竭的交战国来接受它们的条件。真是价廉物美呵！”
    但是价廉物美的交易没有能够做得很顺当，日本法西斯有它自己的打算，它并没有像美帝所希望的那样纠缠于对苏战争。在伟大的苏联红军威力的震慑下，日本帝国主义没有敢冒然进犯苏联，却得寸进尺地向中国大陆推进，而且威胁到了正在迅速增长着的美帝国主义在华“利益”，结果便诱导了美日矛盾的增长。
    一方面以大批战争物资供应日本，一方面又兢兢业业提防日本侵犯自己的远东“利益”，这就是当时美帝国主义远东政策的矛盾。奥斯汀先生也许永远不会把这点吐露出来，但是有一位名叫台维·康的美国作家却早在一九三七年十一月的大西洋月刊中就把这个矛盾暴露无遗了。他这样写道：
    “日本若继续侵略和征服中国，我们售货于日本么？售。
    假使美国人个个同情中国，我们改变现下的政策么？决不改，即使世界所有的国家，都被饥寒的或劫掠成性的或好战的国家蹂躏，这于我们无关痛痒的。
    美国和中国有权利上大冲突么？没有。
    和日本有么？有。
    …………
    日本若征服中国，能有力的和美国在远东的权利冲突么？能。
    战时日本可自由在美国市场购买东西，这有助于日本来征服中国么？有助。
    战时中国不能和美国通商，这有碍于中国的自卫么？有碍。
    …………
    我们现行的政策，对于中日战争，有什么实际影响呢？这显然是帮助强有力而又好侵略的军国人民，来征服那弱而又好和平的非军国人民。这个军国我们曾经建造耗费庞大的海军来和它敌对；它的一切政策时时和我们冲突；它的崛兴，我们很妒忌地提防着；它的立志，我们很怀疑；它说的话，我们不能相信；我们国交上和它一向是仅可维持着合礼而非亲切的态度。它若征服中国，对我们是不利的。可是我们现下就是帮助这样一个军国。”
    正是因为美国财阀们为猎取军火利润的狂热冲昏了头脑，宁可冒战争的危险也不愿停止或减少供给日本的军用物资，才支持了日本长期大规模的对华战争。
    美帝扶助蒋介石并阴谋与日本妥协
    日本侵占东北之后，并没有按照美帝的愿望去进攻苏联，却把侵略战争延烧到华北华中，日本的武装力量直接打击到美帝在华的经济“利益”，这才不能不使美帝“表示严重的关怀”起来。当时，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下已奋起与日本侵略者作殊死的斗争，美帝国主义就想利用中国人民的抵抗来挫折日本侵略者骄横的气焰，但同时美帝国主义清楚地懂得：伟大的中国民族解放战争的炽烈火焰，不但会烧死日本帝国主义，并且也会烧死侵略中国的一切帝国主义。因此，美国需要一个既不公开对日投降，又能镇压中国内部人民革命的傀儡政权，这就是为什么美帝支持蒋介石政府的真实原因。当时美国财阀在各种名目下贷款给蒋介石，前后八次，达二万九千七百万美元之巨，并派遣大批“专家”参加蒋介石的政治、军事、航空、铁路、交通、运输、财政、货币汇兑各部门工作，维持了蒋介石的统治。也许奥斯汀又会把这些行动解释为“高尚的道义上的责任”，但是中国人民很清楚的，这并不是什么“道义责任”，这恰恰是美帝国主义进一步奴役中国的侵略“责任”，恰恰是美帝国主义与日本法西斯及其他帝国主义国家竞争在华权益的积极措施，恰恰是美帝国主义镇压中国人民革命的具体步骤。事实上蒋介石接到了美国援助，并不是消耗在对日战场上，反而是消耗在对中国民主抗日解放区的封锁上。美国帮助了蒋介石，封锁解放区；蒋介石“感激涕零”之下，把中国的货币管理权，西康、昆明附近飞机工厂经营权，西南各地飞机场设立权，滇缅铁路敷设权，以至“检阅蒋介石的军事战略”特权等等，一古脑儿奉送给美国，连老牌英帝的特权也给排挤了出去。美帝国主义的打算确乎很精明，中国与日本打仗，自己从中国和日本两方面取得特权和利润；美国力量增长，日本力量削弱；中国人民解放区被封锁，英法遭排除，到了一定时机自己便从“不干涉”的面幕中露出来；喝令中日双方缴械，牺牲中国抗战，以达到独占中国的目的。今天被奥斯汀吹嘘为神圣的“道义责任”，原来就是这么一会事！
    正因为美帝国主义抱着牺牲中国抗战以达到独占中国的目的，所以在它资助日本侵华、资助蒋介石封锁中共的同时，又竭力进行蒋日妥协的活动。七七事件爆发后不到半个月，美国国务卿赫尔就邀请了蒋家驻美大使王正廷与日本大使齐藤会面，表示中日两国开战，美国“感觉重大之关切”，愿对“和平目标，稍尽棉薄”。同年八月十日美国国务院又给驻日大使格鲁下了一道训令：“向日本政府非正式建议由美国出面斡旋中日两国纠纷之解决，在此一建议计划之中，提出一处中立地点，由中日两国代表在该处会见，进行谈判，并作种种协助，以调整在谈判中可能发生之困难。”这是美帝国主义想把中国和日本同时置于自己的支配之下，以成立瓜分中国的协定的罪恶阴谋。但当时中国人民抗日情绪异常高昂，打击了美帝的这一阴谋；同时，日本对这项建议也并无反响，而使美帝的幻想化成了泡影。
    此后，美帝并没有放弃这种投机渔利的活动，武汉失陷，抗战进入相持阶段之后，日本法西斯侵略者的泥腿在中国大陆上愈陷愈深，对蒋介石采取“政治进攻为主，军事进攻为辅”的方针，引诱蒋介石投降，美帝国主义就出面积极充任此项诱降活动的主要牵线人。奥斯汀若不是假装健忘的话，那就应该能回想起一九三九年“不断敦请中国议和”的东方慕尼黑阴谋，这里面就有美帝的积极参加。当时蒋家外交部长王宠惠曾对记者发表谈话，承认“美国于此时机，对日说话，最为适宜。”（美联社一九三九年九月二十八日电）。孔祥熙也曾面告来华考察的美国人毛勒士，嘱代向美国总统致意，愿意美国出来调停。这些活动后来因中国人民的坚决反对和日本侵略者索价过高而流产。历史事实再一次的证明：美帝不但没有援助中国抗战，而且还积极地起着破坏的作用。
    珍珠港事件是怎样爆发的？
    那么，珍珠港事件是怎么回事呢？是否真像奥斯汀所说“对日本侵略中国表示严重关怀”而引起的呢？稍稍温习一下历史，我们便决不会相信奥斯汀的这种谰言。珍珠港事件完全是由于美、日两个帝国主义国家在远东利益冲突而引起的。为了使历史事实不致被奥斯汀的谎言所歪曲，我们且从欧战的爆发说起。
    一九三九年九月欧战爆发，国际形势急转直下，一九四零年，法国、荷兰已经完蛋了，英国则徘徊在死亡的门口，这些国家在远东的殖民地成了无人看守的财宝，这情势惹动了日本法西斯，也惹动了美国大财阀。日本首先下手攻占了中国的海南岛，并把它的“无敌舰队”列阵于南中国海，对东南亚各地作盘马弯弓的攻击姿态，接着就向英、法、荷提出要求，要求英国封锁滇缅路，缔结英日协定；要求荷兰“经济合作”，还派了一个代表团与荷属东印度商讨煤油问题；对已经完全垮台的法帝国主义更显得不留情面，首先威胁维希政权接受“日法军事协定”“法越日共同防共协定”，后来更干干脆脆把日军开进越南，实行武装占领；处于两大之间所谓“中立”的泰国也一步一步被牵入日本的“共荣圈”内。
    日本想乘机攫取东南亚，美帝也想乘机攫取东南亚，正像当时美国海军参谋长史德林所说：“美日间紧张之关系已达破裂之程度，日本对荷属东印及越南富饶土地之野心日益暴露。”美国的对策是紧紧抓住东南亚，控制一切资源，支持英国重开滇缅路，唆使荷兰只把荷印产油量的四分之一卖给日本。这就使得日本军阀大叫起来，岛田俊雄在日本众议院中演说称：“以美国为中心的敌性国家群……干涉泰国内政，嗾使荷印不供给我国必需的物资，强化新加坡、菲律宾、夏威夷等太平洋地点之防卫，作无益之威胁……事已至此，除了‘干’以外别无他途，吾人希望政府专心致意完成战争目的。”
    这就是美日之间真正矛盾所在，也就是引起珍珠港事件的真正原因。奥斯汀把帝国主义之间矛盾所引起的战争曲解为代中国受过，这种拙劣的谎话除了骗骗自己以及骗骗安理会里的应声虫之外，又有谁肯相信？
    一九四零年到一九四一年间，还有一个重要插曲必需叙述一下，以便弄清楚美帝国主义怎样在珍珠港事件爆发前力求与日本妥协而失败的详情。
    日本法西斯是长期躺在美国财阀的温床上长大的，所以直到珍珠港事件前夕，美帝国主义一向没有想到日本人居然会对自己实行武装进攻。美国防守珍珠港的空军将领之一于日军进攻之前五个月的一次集会上发表了一次奥妙的演说，他说：“我们对付了德国人之后，就可以转向日本小鬼说：‘好，好，小弟弟，要乖一点’，他们就乖一点了。”（见于《中国暴风雨》八三页）这种对日本轻视而又亲昵的情绪弥漫在当时美国上层阶级之间。所以，美国政府一直幻想日本小鬼会听从自己的话，一直在和日本寻求解决远东问题的妥协途径。
    美国人民曾经坚决反对这种出卖中国与东南亚的美日会谈，因此美国国务卿赫尔曾向日本野村大使表示：“目前美国国内情势，日美会谈之进行决非容易。”但实际上，早在一九四零年十二月左右美帝便开始与日本进行所谓“调整美日邦交”的秘密活动，由美国天主教美利诺尔学院主教乌尔歇、事务总长唐拉福特及美政府邮政部长乌卞等人，与日本陆军省军务局的岩畔大佐、井川忠雄等秘密接洽。至一九四一年四月这种接洽逐渐成熟，变为赫尔国务卿与日本驻美大使野村之间的秘密谈判。四月八日，赫尔提出一个“日美谅解方案”的试案，内容包括：美日两国瓜分太平洋霸权；要求日本停止武力南进；美国愿协助日本获得石油、树胶、锡、镍等物资；规定美日两国通商及金融互助；“并为促进两国经济合作起见，美国对于日本愿供给信用贷款，以求改进亚洲经济，促进工商业而实现美日经济合作”；对于中国问题又作了如下的决定：
    “美国总统承认左列条件并使日本政府获得保障起见，对‘蒋政权’（按：引号为原有，下同）根据左列条件劝告和平；甲，中国独立（？）；乙，根据中日间成立之协定，日本军队自中国领土撤退；丙，不并吞中国；丁，不要求赔款；戊，恢复门户开放方针；己，‘蒋政府’与‘汪政府’合并（！）；庚，日本自行限制向中国大量或集团移民；辛，承认满洲国（！）。当‘蒋政权’接受美总统之劝告后，日本政府则认为该政权为树立统一之新中国政府……。”
    从这个文件中，我们可以看出：在珍珠港事件前夕，美帝国主义还在和日本进行妥协活动，甚至以腰斩中国的民族革命与断送中国东北为代价，来换取与日本法西斯瓜分远东霸权，换取美日蒋汪的合作。如今奥斯汀却把这些事实解释为“对日本侵略中国继续表示严重的关怀”，真是厚颜无耻到了无以复加的程度。
    但是日本帝国主义并没有满足于这个方案，特别削除了“停止武力南进”一句，不肯保证美国在东南亚的利益，因此使得赫尔国务卿“颇表疑惑”，谈判延搁了下来。但美帝国主义到这个时候还没有放弃和日本法西斯和平共居的想法，表示愿意继续谈判，可以多让步一些（例如在中国问题上）。著名的绥靖主义者美国驻日大使格鲁还希望美国总统能与日本战犯头子近卫“作三日左右之长谈”，并“竭尽全力，树立此项基础”。（见格鲁著：东京归来）因此谈判又于一九四一年十一月重开，日本代表来栖与野村联袂跨进白宫，举行全世界注目的第一次美日正式会谈。自十一月十七日至十二月五日，在一共二十天的时间内，前后连非正式会谈在内，合计举行了十四次会议，达到了美日交涉的最高潮时期，赫尔并向英大使哈利法克斯、澳公使凯希、荷印公使伦特及蒋介石的狗腿大使胡适等征求他们的意见。会谈所提出的“二十六日案”，据赫尔解释：“十条之中有五条是对于日本有利的”，但日本法西斯迷信武力，没有接受美国的“好意”，决计发动进攻，所以直到开战一年以后，参预谈判的野村大使尚十分惋惜于“伤害了赫尔国务卿对于我们的感情”。（见森正藏著：旋风二十年）
    “莫忘珍珠港”，美国人民曾以此引为教训，它教训美国人民什么呢？它教训美国人民必须起来坚决反对他们的政府，反对到今天不幸仍为杜鲁门所重复奉行的扶植日本法西斯以及侵略亚洲的政策。
    日美开战后美帝进一步侵略中国
    “日美开战以后，美国总是确确实实在援助中国抗战了罢？”不！决不如此。历史事实告诉我们：即使在美日开战以后，美帝仍一贯的想把中国变为自己的独占殖民地，始终没有真正来援助中国的抗战。大家都知道：美国曾以大量物资供给蒋介石，一九四二年给予蒋介石五亿美元的“财政贷款”，在同年春天开始的往后几年中，飞越驼峰的租借物资计达八亿七千万美元，后来并由魏德迈之手陆续装备了美械蒋军二十个师。但大家同样也都知道：这些物资并不是用来与日军作战而是用来对付中国共产党和中国人民的。例如二十师美械蒋军便成了后来蒋介石发动内战的主要资本。这一点美国的反动经济学家巴勃逊当时就坦白承认：在美国五项任务中的第一项就是“阻止苏联在华伸张共产主义，以为援助中国抗日自卫的代价”。所以，一切在抗日的漂亮名目下供给蒋介石的物资，都是为了使“蒋养精蓄锐，预备在战后对付共产党”的。（罗斯福见闻秘录一九三页）
    显然的，美国当时援蒋反共的行为，是它一百年来一贯的侵华政策的具体步骤。美帝国主义深切认识到：要在战后掌握太平洋上的霸权，必须把中国紧紧的抓在手中。早在九一八事件之后，史汀生国务卿在演说中就透露了他的“远见”和野心，他说：“从遥远的历史前途来看，如果不以数十年为期来估计未来的可能性，而以数世纪为期来估计，那么很显然地，美国未来的太平洋关系的重要决定者将是居住于日本各岛的彼岸大陆上的四万万五千万中国人民。”事实证明：美帝国主义自从九一八到今天的二十年间，一直在奉行着史汀生的信条，竭力想把中国变成第二个菲律宾，以实现其统治亚洲，统治太平洋，进而统治全世界的迷梦。
    只要回忆一下抗战后期的史迪威事件，我们便更能了然于美帝奴役中国的意图。一九四二年春天，美国派史迪威担任中缅印战区的司令官，史迪威将军并没有理解美帝对华政策的实质，因此他到了中国就批评蒋介石政府的混乱腐败，他主张团结抗日，主张将援华物资用到对日战场上去，“没有理由应当让蒋把一支庞大的力量放在北方不动，以发泄他对共产党的憎恨”。（见《史迪威日记》）他甚至提议依靠八路军、新四军作战。他当然遭到了蒋介石的猛烈反对，并且也遭到“忠实”于华尔街政策的美帝十四航空队司令著名杀人犯陈纳德的反对，“十四航空队有意计划，使我所做的事情降低价值，而且造出各种荒谬的话”，（见《史迪威日记》）“陈纳德和史迪威之间的失和，动摇了驻华全体美军，你要就是史迪威的人，要就是陈纳德的人，要对两个人同样地友善，就等于走绳索一样地难办”（见《中国暴风雨》）。当美国政府开始发觉史迪威不能“忠实”执行自己的对华政策时，派了威尔基来劝驾，劝史迪威“要做得圆滑一些”（见《史迪威日记》），但最后美国政府完全觉察史迪威并不适合于执行对华侵略的任务时，便干脆地将他撤职而代以“忠实”的赫尔利、魏德迈了。
    按照赫尔利的声明，他来华的使命是：重新扶起当时摇摇欲坠的国民党及蒋介石，所以他在“第一次访问蒋介石的时候就说，美国政府一直是站在蒋个人背后的，而且这次之派代表团来，单纯地是为了援救他和中国。蒋大为高兴，立刻就对赫尔利有了好感，他们之间的友谊于是诞生了。”（见《中国暴风雨》）
    不用更多的解释，在此之后，怀着侵略企图的赫尔利所进行的“斡旋”活动，都是为了要达到干涉和奴役中国的目的。一九四四年十一月，赫尔利在延安与中国共产党会谈，双方签字成立了关于建立民主联合政府和联合统帅部的五点协议。但是说话不算数的美国特使，在由延安回到重庆以后，就立刻撕毁了他所签字的协议，并从此对它缄口不谈。一直到抗战胜利之后，美国政府便又起劲地来帮助蒋介石抢夺中国人民的胜利果实，把蒋军运送到解放区，主使蒋介石进行大规模屠杀中国人民的内战。
    八年抗战的历史事实教训我们：美帝国主义从来就是中国人民敌人的朋友，从来就是中国人民的敌人。它曾经资助日本法西斯对中国的侵略；它曾经企图牺牲中国以求与日本妥协；它曾经主使血腥屠夫蒋介石对中国人民的屠杀。八年抗战中，美帝国主义的真面目就是如此！奥斯汀把这一切曲解为“中美人民间友谊”的“史实”，谁也知道：他不过是要为美帝今天在朝鲜的侵略行动粉饰一番。我们要警告奥斯汀，警告一切美帝国主义的好战分子，过去美帝的一切侵略政策，已在中国人民的坚强反击下遭到了悲惨而可耻的失败。今天，中国人民已经站起来了，已经比抗战时期更坚强百倍，美帝国主义若不甘心于自己的失败而想再来进攻中国，那他们就只会遭到更加悲惨、更加可耻的失败。
