    Expose Austin's Lies!
    The True Face of American Imperialism During Our Country's War of Resistance Against Japan
    Dai Yi
    On November 28th, the American representative Austin delivered a lengthy speech at the Security Council, fabricating a pile of lies and shamelessly listing so-called "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people," attempting to prove that American imperialism "is not a bloody aggressor." He even brazenly mentioned that during our people's War of Resistance Against Japan, "the United States continued to express extremely serious concern about Japan's aggression against China," which "led to the Pearl Harbor incident." Very well! Let us open the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan and see what American imperialism did during the war against Japan? How did the U.S. truly "seriously care" about Japan's invasion of China? Was the Pearl Harbor incident caused by this? History is the fairest judge, it possesses its own irrefutable logic, and will immediately refute Mr. Austin, who is accustomed to reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, so that he is utterly discredited.
    American Imperialism Helped Japan Invade China
    The historical course of the War of Resistance Against Japan is precisely the opposite of what Austin said. From the September 18th Incident in 1931, through the outbreak of the Great War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1941, until the end of the War of Resistance in 1945, American imperialism consistently and actively supported the Japanese fascists' aggression against China, acting as the most vicious accomplice in the massacre of the Chinese people. On the surface, American imperialism pretended to be "neutral" and "non-interfering," and verbally chanted a whole set of hypocritical words that are still repeatedly abused by the likes of Truman, Acheson, and Austin, such as "maintaining peace," "adhering to international agreements," and "promoting world economic security." Of course, we Chinese people have heard enough of this "sweet talk" from American imperialism, but the Chinese people are a nation accustomed to "observing their actions after listening to their words." Let us look at the actions of American imperialism, and we will know what the true face hidden under the mask of so-called "neutrality" and "non-interference" really is.
    During the ten years from the September 18th Incident to the Pearl Harbor Incident, various statistical materials tell us that the military supplies that the United States shipped to Japan increased year by year, becoming the main supplier of war materials for the Japanese fascists. As early as the year of the September 18th Incident, American imperialism began to subsidize Japan's military materials on a large scale. In that year, the United States' trade with Japan changed from a deficit to a surplus. In the following six years, the United States accounted for 45 percent of Japan's foreign military trade. After 1937, under the notorious "cash and carry" act, the amount of supplies shipped to Japan increased year by year. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 1940, the ratio of American military supplies trade to Japan was 33.5 percent in 1937, 34.3 percent in 1938, 34.3 percent in early 1939, and suddenly increased to 38.7 percent in March 1940. After 1940, according to the American White Paper, which tried its best to tout "friendship with China," "the amount of oil, scrap iron and other war potential materials shipped to Japan gradually decreased." However, in fact, until the Pearl Harbor Incident, the war materials that the United States shipped to Japan had not decreased. According to publicly available statistical materials from 1940, the war materials that the United States shipped to Japan in that year still amounted to a huge sum of US$206,388,000. The great revolutionary teacher Lenin pointed out at the Second World Congress of the Communist International in 1920: Japan has the possibility of plundering Eastern countries and Asian countries, but without the assistance of other countries, it does not have the financially and militarily independent strength. Those who actively supported Japan's invasion of China at that time were precisely the American imperialist financial groups who are trying to prove that they are "friends of the Chinese people" today. Without their support, the Japanese fascists would not have dared to launch a large-scale war of aggression, and they would not have been able to sustain the war of aggression for as long as four and a half years. (After the Pearl Harbor Incident, Japan was able to continue the war for more than three and a half years because it had already seized resources from Southeast Asia.)
    As for the types of military supplies that the United States supplied to Japan: According to statistics from the China Economic Research Association in Washington in 1938, the proportion of military supplies shipped to Japan by various countries in the world in that year, coal tar and petroleum products accounted for 65.57 percent; the metal industry and machinery accounted for 77.09 percent; steel and scrap iron accounted for 90.39 percent; copper accounted for 90.39 percent; aircraft and parts accounted for 76.92 percent; semi-finished steel products accounted for 53.67 percent; automobiles and parts accounted for 64.67 percent; metal alloys accounted for 99.33 percent. Among them, for example, in the item of steel, the amount shipped from the United States to Japan in 1936 was 54,000 tons, but it suddenly increased to 880,000 tons in 1937, which is an increase of 16 times. In the item of kerosene, Japan's domestic production was only enough for 10 percent of its needs. 70 percent of the 40 million tons of gasoline consumed in the three years after the invasion of China was supplied by the United States. It can be seen that the United States almost took over the supply of various murderous weapons needed for Japan's invasion of China, and in particular, major war materials such as steel, scrap iron, alloys, copper, and kerosene were almost all supplied by the United States.
    American imperialism not only supplied Japan with a large amount of war materials, but also directly helped Japan establish a modern military industry, solving various technical and economic difficulties in Japan's military industry. Japan's famous Ayukawa Yoshisuke military industry was built up by the United States single-handedly. American companies such as Ford and Holtson supplied Ayukawa's "South Manchuria Railway Corporation" with modern metallurgical technology, making it the "King of the Steel Industry" in Japan, solving a considerable part of the needs of Japan's heavy industry; the American Rockefeller consortium also helped establish Ayukawa's new-style electrified oil extraction industry in North Sakhalin; the aircraft manufacturing industry of Japan's Nakajima consortium completed its modern technological scale with the help of American Mellon Corporation and Ford; the shipbuilding technology and aluminum manufacturing technology of Mitsubishi were also improved with the help of the United States. Especially in the heavy chemical industry, Japan already had considerable equipment in this area, and it was expected that various chemical industrial products could be supplied domestically. However, the war caused a huge new demand for these industrial products, and new factory equipment was urgently needed after 1937. Where could more readily available things be utilized? Thus, American imperialism descended on Japan with Austin-style "serious concern." "Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation" shipped the entire set of equipment for a gas manufacturing factory to Japan; "Monsanto Chemical Company" sold the entire set of equipment for a sulfuric acid plant to Japan; "Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation" even supplied Japan with its own patented "Sch√ºllner" type machines. The care that the United States gave to the Japanese fascists can truly be said to be "meticulous." In the spring of 1939, the Pittsburgh United Engineering & Foundry Co. and Tokyo's Shibaura Machine Works simply merged their operations, with American investment in the plant reaching 49 percent, and providing the plant with a large number of technical and management personnel. According to a report in the Times at the time, the factory's machines were more advanced than those sold to Japan by Germany, and the establishment of this new factory could supply most of Japan's steel production needs.
    Look at this "the United States continues to express extremely serious concern about Japan's aggression against China!" Austin's forte is to avoid talking about the facts, trying his best to distort and fabricate history, and singing beautiful phrases about "friendship with China." However, the eyes of the Chinese people are sharp, and we clearly recognize who is a friend and who is an enemy. Historical facts and statistics expose Austin's shameless lies and lead to his utter bankruptcy.
    The Contradictions of American Imperialism's Far East Policy
    So, why did American imperialism so frantically supply the Japanese fascists with a large number of murderous weapons and help it build a military industry? Of course, we cannot hope that Mr. Austin will utter a single word about this, but a much more honest Senator Schwellenbach from Washington once confessed frankly in October 1939: "We say that Japan has two allied countries, Germany and Italy. In fact, we are Japan's best ally. Anyone will undoubtedly believe that we are actively participating in the war that Japan is conducting in China." This Mr. Schwellenbach confessed with a degree of candor that Austin should be twelve thousand times ashamed of, saying: "Japan sends out soldiers, but our lives are not in any danger in the war. We only transport goods and raw materials to Japan so that they can use them to fight, and we make profits from it." Look! "Making profits," this is the entire secret of American imperialism.
    If we further examine the situation in the Far East at that time, we can more clearly see the intentions of the United States in subsidizing Japan. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the forces of American imperialism in China had been expanding rapidly, they had not yet had time to grasp the hegemony of the Chinese economy. At that time, the U.S. policy toward China was still to sing "open door, equal opportunity," using the military power of Japanese imperialism to open up the spheres of influence of various countries that had been roughly delineated in China, so that Japan and China would weaken each other in the war, in order to allow itself to further intervene in China. This was the highest "interest" of the American imperialists. Comrade Stalin once profoundly analyzed the essence of the non-interference policy in the concluding report of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1939. He pointed out: "The policy of non-intervention reveals an eagerness, a desire, not to hinder the aggressors in doing their dirty work‚Äînot to hinder Japan, say, from embroiling herself in a war with China, or, better still, with the Soviet Union; not to hinder Germany, say, from bogging herself in European affairs, from embroiling herself in a war with the Soviet Union; to allow all the belligerents to sink deeply into the mire of war; to encourage them surreptitiously in this; to allow them to weaken and exhaust one another; and then, when they have become weak enough, to appear on the scene with fresh strength, to appear, of course, 'in the interests of peace,' and to dictate conditions to the enfeebled belligerents. Cheap and easy!"
    However, the cheap and easy deal could not be done very smoothly. The Japanese fascists had their own plans. They did not become entangled in the war against the Soviet Union as the U.S. had hoped. Under the intimidation of the great power of the Soviet Red Army, Japanese imperialism did not dare to rashly invade the Soviet Union, but instead advanced into the Chinese mainland, threatening the "interests" of American imperialism in China, which were rapidly growing. As a result, it induced the growth of contradictions between the United States and Japan.
    On the one hand, it supplied Japan with a large amount of war materials, and on the other hand, it diligently guarded against Japan's infringement on its own Far East "interests." This was the contradiction in the Far East policy of American imperialism at that time. Mr. Austin may never reveal this point, but an American writer named David Cohn exposed this contradiction in the Atlantic Monthly as early as November 1937. He wrote:
    "If Japan continues to invade and conquer China, do we sell goods to Japan? Yes.
    Suppose every American sympathizes with China, do we change our current policy? No, even if all the countries in the world are ravaged by the hungry, the plundering, or the warmongering countries, it is irrelevant to us.
    Does the United States have a major conflict of rights with China? No.
    Does it have one with Japan? Yes.
    ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
    If Japan conquers China, can it powerfully conflict with the rights of the United States in the Far East? Yes.
    Does Japan have the freedom to buy things in the American market during wartime, which helps Japan conquer China? It helps.
    Is China unable to trade with the United States during wartime, which hinders China's self-defense? It hinders.
    ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
    What is the practical impact of our current policy on the Sino-Japanese War? It is clearly helping the powerful and aggressive militarist people to conquer the weak and peace-loving non-militarist people. We have built a huge navy to oppose this military country; all its policies are constantly in conflict with us; we jealously guard against its rise; we are very suspicious of its ambitions; we cannot believe what it says; and our relations with it have always been only polite and not cordial. It is not in our interest if it conquers China. But we are now helping such a military country."
    It was precisely because the American financial groups were blinded by the frenzy of seeking arms profits, and were willing to risk the danger of war rather than stop or reduce the supply of military materials to Japan, that they supported Japan's long-term large-scale war against China.
    American Imperialism Supports Chiang Kai-shek and Conspires to Compromise with Japan
    After Japan occupied the Northeast, it did not attack the Soviet Union according to the wishes of the United States, but instead spread the war of aggression to North and Central China. The armed forces of Japan directly hit the economic "interests" of the United States in China, which could not but make the United States "express serious concern." At that time, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, had risen up to fight a desperate struggle with the Japanese aggressors. American imperialism wanted to use the resistance of the Chinese people to frustrate the arrogant arrogance of the Japanese aggressors, but at the same time, American imperialism clearly understood that the raging flames of the great Chinese national liberation war would not only burn to death Japanese imperialism, but also burn to death all imperialisms that invaded China. Therefore, the United States needed a puppet regime that would neither publicly surrender to Japan nor suppress the internal people's revolution in China. This is the real reason why the U.S. supported the Chiang Kai-shek government. At that time, American financial groups loaned Chiang Kai-shek money under various names, eight times in total, amounting to a huge sum of US$297 million, and sent a large number of "experts" to participate in the work of Chiang Kai-shek's political, military, aviation, railway, transportation, finance, and currency exchange departments, maintaining Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Perhaps Austin will again interpret these actions as "noble moral responsibilities," but the Chinese people are very clear that this is not a "moral responsibility," this is precisely the aggressive "responsibility" of American imperialism to further enslave China, precisely the active measures of American imperialism to compete for rights and interests in China with Japanese fascists and other imperialist countries, precisely the specific steps of American imperialism to suppress the Chinese people's revolution. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek received American aid, which was not spent on the battlefield against Japan, but on the blockade of the Chinese democratic anti-Japanese liberation areas. The United States helped Chiang Kai-shek to blockade the liberated areas; Chiang Kai-shek, under "tears of gratitude," presented the Chinese currency management rights, the operating rights of aircraft factories near Xikang and Kunming, the right to establish airports in various parts of the southwest, the right to lay the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and even the special right to "review Chiang Kai-shek's military strategy" to the United States in one go, even squeezing out the privileges of the old-brand British Empire. The plans of American imperialism are indeed very clever. China and Japan fight, and they obtain privileges and profits from both China and Japan; American power grows, and Japanese power weakens; the Chinese people's liberated areas are blockaded, and Britain and France are excluded. At a certain time, they themselves emerge from the mask of "non-interference," order China and Japan to disarm, and sacrifice China's war of resistance to achieve the goal of exclusively occupying China. What Austin boasted today as a sacred "moral responsibility" is just this!
    It was precisely because American imperialism held the goal of sacrificing China's war of resistance to achieve the goal of exclusively occupying China, that while it subsidized Japan's invasion of China and subsidized Chiang Kai-shek's blockade of the CCP, it also made every effort to carry out activities to compromise between Chiang and Japan. Less than half a month after the July 7th Incident broke out, U.S. Secretary of State Hull invited Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, and Japanese Ambassador Saito to meet, expressing that the United States "felt great concern" about the outbreak of war between China and Japan, and was willing to "do its best for the cause of peace." On August 10 of the same year, the U.S. State Department issued an instruction to Ambassador Grew in Japan: "To informally suggest to the Japanese government that the United States mediate the solution of the disputes between China and Japan, in this proposed plan, propose a neutral location where representatives of China and Japan can meet, conduct negotiations, and provide various assistance to adjust the difficulties that may arise in the negotiations." This was an evil conspiracy by American imperialism to place China and Japan under its own control at the same time in order to conclude an agreement to divide China. However, at that time, the anti-Japanese sentiments of the Chinese people were extremely high, which dealt a blow to this conspiracy of the United States; at the same time, Japan did not respond to this proposal, which turned the illusion of the United States into a bubble.
    After that, the United States did not abandon this activity of speculation and profiteering. After the fall of Wuhan and the War of Resistance entered a stalemate, the muddy legs of the Japanese fascist aggressors became more and more deeply mired in the Chinese mainland. They adopted a policy of "political offense as the mainstay and military offense as the supplement" against Chiang Kai-shek, inducing Chiang Kai-shek to surrender. American imperialism came forward and actively served as the main liaison for this inducement activity. If Austin is not pretending to be forgetful, then he should be able to recall the "constantly urging China to negotiate peace" Munich conspiracy in the East in 1939, in which the United States actively participated. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui made a statement to reporters, admitting that "the United States is most suitable to speak to Japan at this time." (Associated Press telegram, September 28, 1939). Kong Xiangxi also told American Maurer, who came to China for investigation, and asked him to convey his greetings to the U.S. President, and was willing to have the United States come out to mediate. These activities later miscarried due to the firm opposition of the Chinese people and the excessively high asking price of the Japanese aggressors. Historical facts once again prove that the United States not only did not assist China's war of resistance, but also actively played a destructive role.
    How Did the Pearl Harbor Incident Break Out?
    So, what was the Pearl Harbor Incident all about? Was it really caused by "expressing serious concern about Japan's invasion of China" as Austin said? With a little review of history, we will never believe Austin's nonsense. The Pearl Harbor Incident was entirely caused by the conflict of interests between the United States and Japan in the Far East. In order to prevent historical facts from being distorted by Austin's lies, let us start with the outbreak of the European War.
    When the European War broke out in September 1939, the international situation took a sharp turn for the worse. In 1940, France and the Netherlands were finished, and Britain was hovering at the door of death. The colonies of these countries in the Far East became unguarded treasures. This situation stirred up the Japanese fascists and also stirred up the American financial groups. Japan first attacked and occupied Hainan Island in China, and deployed its "invincible fleet" in the South China Sea, posing a posture of attacking Southeast Asia. Then, it made demands on Britain, France, and the Netherlands, demanding that Britain block the Burma Road and conclude the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; demanding that the Netherlands "economic cooperation," and also sent a delegation to discuss oil issues with the Dutch East Indies; it was even more merciless to the completely collapsed French imperialism, first threatening the Vichy government to accept the "Japan-France Military Agreement" and the "Franco-Vietnamese-Japanese Joint Anti-Communist Agreement," and later simply sent Japanese troops into Vietnam, implementing armed occupation; Thailand, which was in a so-called "neutral" position between the two major powers, was also gradually drawn into Japan's "Co-prosperity Sphere."
    Japan wanted to take the opportunity to seize Southeast Asia, and the United States also wanted to take the opportunity to seize Southeast Asia, just as then U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Harold R. Stark, said: "The tense relationship between the U.S. and Japan has reached the point of breaking, and Japan's ambition for the rich land of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam is increasingly exposed." The United States' countermeasure was to firmly grasp Southeast Asia, control all resources, support Britain to reopen the Burma Road, and instigate the Netherlands to sell only a quarter of the oil production of the Dutch East Indies to Japan. This made the Japanese warlords cry out. Toshio Shimada said in a speech in the Japanese House of Representatives: "The group of hostile countries centered on the United States... interferes in Thailand's internal affairs, instigates the Dutch East Indies not to supply our country with necessary materials, strengthens the defense of the Pacific locations such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Hawaii, and makes useless threats... Things have come to this, there is no other way but to 'fight'. We hope that the government will concentrate on completing the war purpose."
    This is the real contradiction between the United States and Japan, and the real reason that caused the Pearl Harbor Incident. Austin distorts the war caused by the contradictions between imperialist countries as suffering for China. Who would believe this clumsy lie except to deceive themselves and the yes-men in the Security Council?
    There is also an important episode between 1940 and 1941 that must be described in order to clarify the details of how American imperialism sought to compromise with Japan before the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor Incident, but failed.
    The Japanese fascists grew up on the warm bed of American financial groups for a long time, so until the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, American imperialism had never thought that the Japanese would actually launch an armed attack on themselves. One of the U.S. Air Force generals defending Pearl Harbor gave a mysterious speech at a gathering five months before the Japanese attack, saying: "After we deal with the Germans, we can turn to the Japanese devils and say: 'Okay, okay, little brother, be good', and they will be good." (See "China's Storm," page 83) This feeling of contempt and intimacy for Japan permeated the American upper class at that time. Therefore, the U.S. government had always fantasized that the Japanese devils would listen to them, and had been seeking a way to compromise with Japan to solve the problems in the Far East.
    The American people had resolutely opposed this U.S.-Japan meeting that sold out China and Southeast Asia. Therefore, U.S. Secretary of State Hull had told Japanese Ambassador Nomura: "The current situation in the United States makes it by no means easy to conduct U.S.-Japan talks." But in fact, as early as around December 1940, the U.S. began secret activities with Japan to so-called "adjust U.S.-Japan relations," with U.S. Catholic Maryknoll College Bishop Walsh, General Secretary Don Rafferty, and U.S. Postmaster General Ubien, etc., secretly contacting Colonel Iwakuro and Tadao Ikawa of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau. By April 1941, this contact had gradually matured, becoming a secret negotiation between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura. On April 8, Hull proposed a draft of a "U.S.-Japan Understanding Plan," which included: the U.S. and Japan dividing the Pacific hegemony; requiring Japan to stop its military advance southward; the United States was willing to assist Japan in obtaining materials such as oil, rubber, tin, and nickel; stipulating commercial and financial mutual assistance between the U.S. and Japan; "and in order to promote economic cooperation between the two countries, the United States is willing to provide credit loans to Japan in order to improve the Asian economy, promote industry and commerce, and realize U.S.-Japan economic cooperation"; the following decisions were made on the China issue:
    "In order for the U.S. President to recognize the left-column conditions and to guarantee the Japanese government, he will advise 'the Chiang regime' (note: quotation marks are original, the same below) to make peace based on the left-column conditions; A, Chinese independence (?); B, according to the agreement established between China and Japan, the Japanese army will withdraw from Chinese territory; C, not annexing China; D, not demanding compensation; E, restoring the open door policy; F, merging 'the Chiang government' with 'the Wang government' (!); G, Japan will limit the large-scale or group immigration to China on its own; H, recognizing Manchukuo (!). When 'the Chiang regime' accepts the advice of the U.S. President, the Japanese government will regard the regime as establishing a unified new Chinese government..."
    From this document, we can see that on the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, American imperialism was still conducting compromise activities with Japan, even at the cost of cutting China's national revolution in half and sacrificing Northeast China in exchange for dividing the Far East hegemony with Japanese fascism, and in exchange for U.S.-Japan-Chiang-Wang cooperation. Now Austin explains these facts as "continuing to express serious concern about Japan's invasion of China," which is truly shameless to the extreme.
    However, Japanese imperialism was not satisfied with this plan, especially eliminating the phrase "stopping the military advance southward," and was unwilling to guarantee U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Therefore, Secretary of State Hull "expressed considerable doubt," and the negotiations were delayed. But American imperialism had not given up the idea of peaceful coexistence with Japanese fascism at this time, expressing its willingness to continue negotiations and make more concessions (for example, on the China issue). The famous appeasementist U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, also hoped that the U.S. President could have "a long talk of about three days" with Japanese war criminal leader Konoe, and "do everything possible to establish this foundation." (See Grew's "Return to Tokyo") Therefore, negotiations reopened in November 1941, and Japanese representatives Kurusu and Nomura jointly stepped into the White House, holding the first official U.S.-Japan meeting that attracted worldwide attention. From November 17 to December 5, a total of 14 meetings, including informal meetings, were held in a total of 20 days, reaching the highest peak of the U.S.-Japan negotiations. Hull also sought the opinions of British Ambassador Halifax, Australian Minister Casey, Dutch East Indies Minister Lunt, and Chiang Kai-shek's running dog Ambassador Hu Shih. The "26th proposal" put forward at the meeting, according to Hull's explanation: "Five out of the ten articles are beneficial to Japan," but Japanese fascists believed in force and did not accept the "good intentions" of the United States, and decided to launch an attack. Therefore, even a year after the start of the war, Ambassador Nomura, who participated in the negotiations, still regretted that "he had hurt Secretary of State Hull's feelings for us." (See Masao Mori, "Twenty Years of Whirlwind")
    "Remember Pearl Harbor," the American people have used this as a lesson. What does it teach the American people? It teaches the American people that they must rise up and resolutely oppose their government, and oppose the policy of supporting Japanese fascism and invading Asia, which is still unfortunately repeated by Truman today.
    After the Outbreak of the U.S.-Japan War, American Imperialism Further Invaded China
    "After the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States was always definitely helping China's war of resistance, right?" No! Absolutely not. Historical facts tell us that even after the outbreak of the U.S.-Japan war, the United States still consistently wanted to turn China into its own exclusive colony, and never really helped China's war of resistance. Everyone knows that the United States supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of materials, gave Chiang Kai-shek a "financial loan" of US$500 million in 1942, and in the years from the spring of the same year, the leased materials flying over the Hump reached US$870 million. Later, Wei Demai gradually equipped 20 divisions of American-equipped Chiang army. But everyone also knows that these materials were not used to fight against the Japanese army, but to deal with the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. For example, the 20 American-equipped Chiang army divisions became the main capital for Chiang Kai-shek to launch the civil war later. This was frankly admitted by the American reactionary economist Babbson at the time: the first of the five tasks of the United States was to "prevent the Soviet Union from spreading communism in China, as the price of assisting China in resisting Japan and defending itself." Therefore, all the materials supplied to Chiang Kai-shek under the beautiful name of resisting Japan were to enable "Chiang to recuperate and prepare to deal with the Communist Party after the war." (Roosevelt's Secret Records, page 193)
    Obviously, the U.S.'s behavior of supporting Chiang against the Communist Party at that time was a concrete step in its consistent policy of aggression against China for the past 100 years. American imperialism deeply realized that in order to seize hegemony in the Pacific after the war, it must firmly grasp China in its hands. As early as after the September 18th Incident, Secretary of State Stimson revealed his "foresight" and ambition in a speech. He said: "Looking at the distant historical future, if we do not estimate the future possibilities with decades as the period, but with centuries as the period, then it is very clear that the important decision-maker of the future Pacific relations of the United States will be the 450 million Chinese people living on the mainland across the islands of Japan." Facts have proved that American imperialism has been following Stimson's creed for the 20 years from September 18th to today, and has been trying its best to turn China into a second Philippines in order to realize its dream of dominating Asia, dominating the Pacific, and then dominating the world.
    Just by recalling the Stilwell incident in the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we can better understand the intention of the U.S. to enslave China. In the spring of 1942, the United States sent Stilwell to serve as the commander of the China-Burma-India Theater. General Stilwell did not understand the essence of the U.S. policy toward China. Therefore, when he arrived in China, he criticized the chaos and corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government. He advocated uniting against Japan and advocated using the aid materials to China on the battlefield against Japan. "There is no reason why Chiang should keep a huge force in the north without moving, to vent his hatred for the Communist Party." (See "Stilwell's Diary") He even proposed to rely on the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to fight. He was of course strongly opposed by Chiang Kai-shek, and also opposed by Chennault, the commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force and a famous murderer, who was "loyal" to Wall Street's policy. "The 14th Air Force deliberately planned to devalue what I did, and made all kinds of absurd words," (See "Stilwell's Diary") "The discord between Chennault and Stilwell shook the entire U.S. military stationed in China. You are either Stilwell's people, or Chennault's people. It is as difficult as walking a tightrope to be equally friendly to the two people" (See "China's Storm"). When the U.S. government began to realize that Stilwell could not "faithfully" implement its policy toward China, it sent Willkie to persuade him to "be more tactful" (See "Stilwell's Diary"), but in the end, when the U.S. government completely realized that Stilwell was not suitable for carrying out the task of aggression against China, it simply dismissed him and replaced him with the "loyal" Hurley and Wei Demai.
    According to Hurley's statement, his mission to China was to: re-support the then-shaky Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, so he "said during his first visit to Chiang Kai-shek that the U.S. government had always been behind Chiang personally, and that the dispatch of the delegation this time was purely to rescue him and China. Chiang was very happy and immediately had a good impression of Hurley. Their friendship was thus born." (See "China's Storm")
    Without further explanation, after this, Hurley's "mediation" activities with aggressive intentions were all to achieve the goal of interfering in and enslaving China. In November 1944, Hurley held talks with the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an, and the two sides signed a five-point agreement on the establishment of a democratic coalition government and a joint command. However, the U.S. envoy, who did not keep his word, immediately tore up the agreement he signed after returning to Chongqing from Yan'an, and has since remained silent about it. It was not until after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan that the U.S. government vigorously helped Chiang Kai-shek seize the fruits of victory of the Chinese people, transported the Chiang army to the liberated areas, and instigated Chiang Kai-shek to carry out a large-scale civil war to massacre the Chinese people.
    The historical facts of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan teach us that American imperialism has always been the friend of the enemies of the Chinese people, and has always been the enemy of the Chinese people. It once subsidized the Japanese fascists' aggression against China; it once attempted to sacrifice China in order to compromise with Japan; it once instigated the bloody butcher Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the Chinese people. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the true face of American imperialism was just like this! Austin distorts all this as "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people," and everyone knows that he is just trying to whitewash the U.S. invasion of Korea today. We want to warn Austin, warn all the warmongers of American imperialism, that all the aggressive policies of the U.S. in the past have been met with tragic and shameful failure under the firm resistance of the Chinese people. Today, the Chinese people have stood up and are a hundred times stronger than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. If American imperialism is unwilling to accept its own failure and wants to attack China again, then they will only suffer a more tragic and more shameful failure.
