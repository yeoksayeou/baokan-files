Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, December 26th: The newspaper "Zafer", which usually reflects the opinions of the Turkish ruling clique, openly criticizes the incompetent command of the invading US military authorities. Unwilling to admit that the near total annihilation of the Turkish Brigade sent to the Korean front to serve as cannon fodder for the United States was the result of the victorious offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's Army, the newspaper blames all losses on the US military authorities' "improper deployment." The newspaper protested: "The Turkish Brigade was not mechanized and should not have been assigned as a rearguard unit for the US Eighth Army." The newspaper resentfully stated: "Turkey, having followed the United States and provided the largest number of troops for the Far East war, therefore has the right to state the truth and protest these methods that have caused Turkish blood to be shed in vain." The newspaper fiercely attacked the US strategy in Korea, saying "American generals don't know how to fight," and vehemently criticized the "reckless retreat" of the "United Nations forces" when attacked. The newspaper said: "General MacArthur has declared that he could not foresee the Chinese offensive. But in reality, this is a statement without any military value. The Chinese offensive can by no means be said to be unexpected." The newspaper also questioned: "Why, at the critical moment of the war, did two corps commanders (referring to the former commander of the US Eighth Army, Walker, and the commander of the Tenth Corps, Almond) fly to Tokyo to confer with General MacArthur?" The newspaper lamented that 150,000 "United Nations forces" with "absolute superiority in firepower" could not hold "a solid defense line."

    侵朝土耳其帮凶军被歼后土统治集团埋怨美军当局
    【新华社二十六日讯】安哥拉讯：通常反映土耳其统治集团意见的《萨弗尔》报，公开非难侵略美军当局指挥不当。该报不愿供认到朝鲜前线去为美国当炮灰的土耳其旅之几乎全部被歼是中朝人民军胜利攻势的结果，反把一切损失归咎于美军当局“布置失当”。该报抗议说：“土耳其旅没有机械化，不应该派作美军第八军的殿后部队”。该报愤懑地说：“土耳其曾追随美国之后，为远东战争提供了最大的兵员，因此有权说明其真相，并且抗议这些使土耳其人的血白流了的方法。”该报猛烈攻击美国在朝鲜的战略，说“美国将领们不懂得怎么作战”，并猛烈批评“联合国军”在受到攻击时的“轻率撤退”。该报说：“麦克阿瑟将军曾宣称他无法预料中国人的攻势。但实际上这是一个毫无军事价值的声明。中国人的进攻决不能说是出人意外”。该报并提出质问说：“为什么在战争紧急的关头，两位兵团司令官（按指前美军第八军军长瓦克与第十兵团司令阿尔梦德）却坐飞机跑到东京去和麦克阿瑟将军会商呢？”该报哀叹这支“在火力方面占绝对优势的”十五万“联合国军”，竟守不住“一条巩固的防线”。
