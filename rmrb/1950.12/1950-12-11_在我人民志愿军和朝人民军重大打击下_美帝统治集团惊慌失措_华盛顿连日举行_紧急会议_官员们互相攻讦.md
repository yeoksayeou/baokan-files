Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The annihilating blows dealt to the invading American troops by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have thrown the American ruling group into a panic, and great chaos has occurred within them. The "National Security Council," the highest decision-making body of the Truman administration, hurriedly convened an emergency meeting on November 28. On the 2nd of this month, Acheson urgently summoned the main American representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, such as Austin and Gross, to Washington for an "emergency meeting." The State Department also "summoned" diplomats from twenty Latin American countries to inform them of the "critical situation." On the 3rd, Truman, disregarding the weekend holiday, convened a series of "extraordinary meetings" of top military and diplomatic personnel.

    Simultaneous with these hurried official activities, Washington was heavily shrouded in an atmosphere of panic and anxiety. The U.S. imperialist news agency, United Press, described Washington despondently as a "worried capital." The official United States Information Service also helplessly admitted: "Washington is worried and perplexed about the situation in Korea." Even the Department of Defense "does not attempt to conceal its disappointment." The U.S. Department of Defense initially believed that the so-called "overwhelming sea and air superiority" and "the superior firepower of everyone" could at least hold the line north of Pyongyang and Wonsan. But by the 5th, according to the United States Information Service: Washington "officials" wailed: "The 'United Nations' forces have lost control of the military situation in Korea and can no longer hope to hold any defensive line across the Korean Peninsula." Many reactionary American newspapers, which had repeatedly boasted about the American aggressor army, are now sadly speculating about the "possibility of a Dunkirk-style retreat" for the invading American troops.

    The chaotic spectacle in Washington is also revealed in the telegrams of the Kuomintang bandit gang's Central News Agency. In a special dispatch from Washington on the 5th, it admitted: "Today's Washington has become a capital permeated with rumors, unofficial disclosures, and denials. The general public is confused, both militarily and diplomatically. ... Newspapers report in the morning what some负责人 said, and by the afternoon it is denied by other responsible authorities."

    The American ruling class is also burying and attacking each other. Democratic Senator Byrd of Virginia complained that the entire Korean War has become a "tragic mistake." He exclaimed: "The 'United Nations' forces must immediately withdraw from Korea, or they will only die." Republican Senator Johnson strongly criticized the Truman administration in the Senate on the 4th. He suggested that Congress should invoke its constitutional powers to impeach Truman if necessary. On the 7th, Republican Congressman Scott of Pennsylvania, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, angrily demanded in the House that Truman dismiss Acheson. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had always praised MacArthur as a hero, sadly rebuked "this general who has failed to such a shocking extent" in an editorial published on the 5th entitled "MacArthur's Debacle," saying that he had committed "major military errors" and expressed "increasing difficulty in trusting the military capabilities of a commander-in-chief whose serious errors are caused by confusion of facts and intelligence." The newspaper called the blow suffered by the invading American troops this time "the biggest defeat in the history of the American Army."

    在我人民志愿军和朝人民军重大打击下
    美帝统治集团惊慌失措
    华盛顿连日举行“紧急会议”官员们互相攻讦
    【新华社十日讯】我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军对侵朝美军的歼灭性打击，已使美国统治集团惊慌失措，他们的内部发生了很大混乱。杜鲁门政府最高决策机关“国家安全委员会”曾于十一月二十八日慌忙召开紧急会议。本月二日，艾奇逊又急召美出席联合国大会主要代表奥斯汀、葛罗斯等赴华盛顿举行“紧急会议”，国务院并“召见了”二十个拉丁美洲国家的外交官，向他们传达“危急形势”。三日，杜鲁门不顾星期假日，又召集最高级军事和外交人员举行一连串“非常会议”。
    与这些匆忙的官方活动同时，华盛顿为慌乱和忧虑的气氛重重笼罩。美帝国主义通讯社合众社沮丧地以“忧虑的首都”形容华盛顿。官方的美国新闻处也无可奈何地承认：“华盛顿方面对朝鲜形势感到忧虑与迷惑”。连国防部“也不企图掩饰失望情绪”。美国国防部起初还认为所谓“压倒性的海空优势”和“每一个人的优势火力”，至少可以守住平壤及元山以北一线。但到了五日，据美国新闻处透露：华盛顿“负责人士”哀号：“‘联合国’部队已丧失对朝鲜军事局势的控制，并且不能再希望横越朝鲜半岛守住任何一道防线。”曾一再替美国侵略军吹嘘的美国许多反动报刊，目前正在悲哀地揣测着侵朝美军“作敦刻尔刻撤退的可能性”。
    华盛顿的慌乱丑态，在国民党匪帮中央社的电讯中也透露出来。它在五日发出的一则华盛顿专电中承认：“当今的华府，已成为谣传、非官方的透露和否认所弥漫的首都。一般人一头混乱，在军事和外交两方面都是如此。……报纸在早晨报道某某负责人说些什么，到了午后又为其他负责当局所否认。”
    美国统治阶级内部并相互埋骂，相互攻讦。民主党弗吉尼亚洲参议员比尔德埋怨地说：整个朝鲜战争已变成“错误的悲剧”了。他惊呼：“‘联合国’部队必须立即自朝鲜撤退，不然就只有死。”共和党参议员简森四日在参院极力抨击杜鲁门政府，他建议必要时国会应援引宪法权力罢免杜鲁门。七日，共和党前全国委员会主席宾夕法尼亚州众议员斯考特在众院愤怒地提出要杜鲁门将艾奇逊撤职。甚至连一向捧麦克阿瑟为英雄的纽约先驱论坛报，于五日发表的题为“麦克阿瑟的惨败”的社论中，也伤心地责骂“这位失败到这种惊人地步的将军”，说他犯了“重大的军事错误”，并“对一个由于事实与情报的混乱而造成这样严重错误的总司令部的军事能力”，表示“愈来愈难予以信任了”。该报把侵朝美军这次所受打击称为“美国陆军史上最大的败绩”。
