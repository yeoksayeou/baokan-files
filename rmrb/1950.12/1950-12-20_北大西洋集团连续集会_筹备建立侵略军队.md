    Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: Having suffered disastrous defeats on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism is now undertaking a series of measures to accelerate the establishment of the North Atlantic collective aggressive army, with West German mercenaries as its backbone, in order to prepare for larger-scale aggressive war. This is being done on the basis of the French government's submission and agreement to establish thirty brigades of West German troops.

    To this end, the North Atlantic aggressive group, manipulated by the United States, has recently begun a series of meetings. Among those already held are: the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee meeting held in London on December 12 (attended by chiefs of staff of various countries), the joint meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Foreign Ministers' Assistants and the Military Committee held on the 13th. Upcoming meetings include the North Atlantic Treaty Defense Committee meeting (attended by defense ministers of various countries) and the Council meeting (attended by foreign ministers of various countries) to be held in Brussels starting December 18th. At the same time, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have also decided to hold a meeting in Brussels. According to the United Press, the purpose of all these meetings is to decide on the steps to establish West German mercenaries and the North Atlantic collective aggressive army. The joint meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee and the Foreign Ministers' Assistants, presided over by American Naval Operations Commander Sherman, has decided to appoint Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic aggressive army, which will soon be approved by the Brussels meeting.
