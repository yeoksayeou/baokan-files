    I. The First National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education was jointly convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After several months of investigation, research, and preparation, the conference began on September 18th with two days of preparatory meetings to hear work reports and experience introductions from representatives from various regions. The official opening was on the 20th, and the closing ceremony was held on the afternoon of the 29th. The representatives attending this conference included: heads of education departments and cultural and educational departments of trade unions at all levels of the Central Government, major administrative regions, provinces, and cities; heads of industrial management departments (heavy industry, light industry, fuel industry, textile industry, etc.); managers of public and private factories; heads of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Ministry of Labor; principals of workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools; model teachers and model students of workers' and peasants' spare-time schools; specially invited scholars; and representatives from various ministries, commissions, institutes, and administrations of the Central People's Government, totaling 345 people. 89 people attended as observers, bringing the total number of attendees and observers to over 470.

    II. Over the past year, mass education for workers and peasants and education for workers' and peasants' cadres have seen significant development and improvement. Last winter, over 12 million peasants participated in winter school studies, and this year, 3 million people have transitioned to people-run schools for year-round learning. 18 workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools have been established nationwide, with 2,520 students. Shanxi has also established workers' and peasants' rapid primary schools, enrolling over 1,250 workers' and peasants' cadres with educational levels below senior primary school graduation. In addition, in terms of spare-time learning for workers' and peasants' cadres, Hebei Province has organized over 40,000 people, and Taiyuan City has organized over 1,500 people to supplement their cultural knowledge. Comrades working in various regions have accumulated some experience. It can be said that a good start has been made in "strengthening workers' spare-time education and on-the-job cadre education." However, many problems still exist and urgently need to be resolved, such as unclear guiding principles and tasks, inconsistent leadership ideas, a lack of specific methods, chaotic leadership relationships, and insufficient funding, as well as conflicts between study time and production time. This conference was convened based on this foundation and these demands. The purpose of the conference was to unify guiding ideology, clarify guiding principles and tasks, stipulate specific implementation methods and steps, improve leadership relationships, and, as much as possible, resolve various specific issues such as funding and study time.

    III. This conference first received instructions from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Liu regarding guiding principles. All representatives, based on the spirit of the instructions and in combination with their local conditions and work experience, conducted repeated and in-depth discussions, criticized incorrect thoughts and viewpoints, and gradually reached a consensus on the following guiding principles:

    (I) Clarified the significant political significance of strengthening workers' and peasants' education: It is a necessary condition for consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship and establishing a strong national defense force and a strong economic force; without the popularization and improvement of workers' and peasants' cultural education, there will be no upsurge in cultural construction.

    (II) Based on the current overall situation and overall tasks of the country, the current implementation policy for workers' and peasants' education should be: In terms of educational targets, we must first focus on the education of workers' and peasants' cadres and activists, and extend it conditionally to organized young men and women and workers and peasants who urgently request to learn. In terms of educational content, for the current period, workers' and peasants' cadres, activists, and rural peasants who have completed land reform and workers whose production has returned to normal and who have undergone political enlightenment education should focus on cultural education (primarily literacy), combined appropriately with political education, production technology education, and health education. In newly liberated areas and semi-old areas, it should generally still be combined with mass struggles and with the central tasks of the time and place, with policy and current affairs education as the main content. Disregarding the importance of learning culture and unilaterally emphasizing learning culture are both incorrect. In terms of implementation steps, we should proceed steadily with a focus, adapt to local conditions and times, create typical demonstrations, and gradually promote development on a consolidated foundation. Currently, we can only actively promote literacy education among workers and peasants, gradually reducing illiteracy; we cannot yet put forward the slogan of "completely eliminating illiteracy." We must prevent the formalism of being eager for quick success or only pursuing numbers without paying attention to results.

    (III) Workers' and peasants' education is a massive mass movement and must implement the mass line. We must rely fully on the power of the masses themselves to carry out the work based on the masses' conscious voluntariness. We must overcome the viewpoints of belittling the workers and peasants, the patronizing attitude towards workers and peasants, and the work styles of taking over everything and commandism. The funding for workers' and peasants' mass education mainly relies on the masses themselves to solve, with the government providing key subsidies. The issue of teachers, in the primary and intermediate classes of literacy education, should be solved by mobilizing and organizing mass teachers and all people who can potentially serve as teachers, implementing the principle of people teaching people as the main approach, and establishing a certain number of full-time teachers as the backbone when necessary and possible. The forms of learning organizations must be diverse, based on the actual local conditions and adapting to the needs, possibilities, and habits of the masses. We cannot force uniformity or demand regularization.

    (IV) In terms of leadership relationships, we must realize the principle of "government leadership, relying on mass organizations, and cooperation from all aspects" to achieve unified leadership, division of labor and cooperation, and do the work well. We must overcome departmentalism and taking over everything, but we cannot shirk responsibility. The idea of "if you manage it, I don't manage it, and if I manage it, you can't manage it" is wrong.

    Reaching a consensus on the above guiding principles is the main achievement of this conference.

    IV. Based on the above guiding principles, the conference revised and passed: Instructions on Running Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools and Workers' and Peasants' Cadre Cultural Remedial Schools, Instructions on Carrying Out Farmers' Spare-Time Education, Provisional Implementation Measures for Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools, Provisional Implementation Measures for Workers' and Peasants' Cadre Cultural Remedial Schools, Provisional Implementation Measures for Employees' Spare-Time Education, and Organizational Regulations for Employees' Spare-Time Education Committees at All Levels. These six draft documents clearly stipulate the tasks, guiding principles, systems, teaching plans, teachers, funding, and leadership relationships of various workers' and peasants' education organizations in the form of laws. It is proposed to submit the Instructions on Running Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools and Workers' and Peasants' Cadre Cultural Remedial Schools and the Organizational Regulations for Employees' Spare-Time Education Committees to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and promulgation. It is proposed that the Instructions on Carrying Out Farmers' Spare-Time Education and the three Provisional Implementation Measures be approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and promulgated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.

    After the conference, representatives from various regions, based on the resolutions of the conference and according to their local conditions and objective conditions, separately formulated implementation steps and preliminary plans, and determined the tasks for carrying out workers' and peasants' education in 1951.

    V. There are two other issues that the conference did not make specific provisions for because they involve a wide range. One is the issue of on-the-job learning for workers' and peasants' cadres, and the other is the issue of running various cadre schools that allow workers' and peasants' cadres to learn culture and business at the same time. It is proposed to invite the heads of relevant departments of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government to discuss and resolve these issues.

    VI. During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu, Vice Chairman Li, and Vice Premiers Dong, Guo, and Huang of the Government Administration Council, and Vice Chairman Li of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions all gave reports to the conference, which not only provided guidance on guiding principles but also gave great encouragement to the representatives. Responsible comrades from relevant departments such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry and various people's organizations also came to the meeting to speak, providing many valuable opinions and unanimously expressing their willingness to cooperate and help solve difficult problems as much as possible to implement the resolutions of the conference, which greatly increased the confidence of the attending representatives and provided a good example for various regions. Soviet experts introduced the Soviet Union's experience in running workers' and peasants' middle schools and eliminating illiteracy, which provided a reference for the conference. All of these provided great help to the success of the conference.

    中央人民政府教育部
    关于第一次全国工农教育会议的报告
    （马叙伦部长在一九五零年十一月十日政务院第五十八次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    一、第一次全国工农教育会议，是中央人民政府教育部和中华全国总工会联合召开的。经过几个月的调查研究和准备工作，会议于九月十八日开始，举行两天预备会，听取各地代表工作报告及经验介绍，二十日正式开幕，二十九日下午闭幕。出席这次大会的代表有：中央、各大行政区、各省、市人民政府教育部门及各级工会文教部的负责人，各产业管理部门（重工业、轻工业、燃料工业、纺织工业等）负责人，公私营工厂经理与青年团中央、全国妇联、劳动部负责人以及中央人民政府各部、会、院、署的代表，工农速成中学校长，工人、农民业余学校的模范教师和学习模范，特邀的学者等计三百四十五人，列席的八十九人，连同到会旁听的共四百七十余人。
    二、一年来，工农群众教育和工农干部教育已有了显著的发展和提高。去年冬季，农民参加冬学学习的达一千二百余万人，今年转为民校坚持常年学习的有三百万人。全国工人参加业余学习的有七十万余人。创办工农速成中学十八所，学生二千五百二十人。山西还举办了工农速成小学，吸收了不及高小毕业文化程度的工农干部一千二百五十余人入学。此外对在职工农干部的业余学习，河北省已组织起四万余人，太原市已组织起一千五百余人，补习文化。各地工作同志已积累了一定的经验。在“加强劳动者的业余教育和在职干部教育”方面，可以说已经有了一个良好的开端。但仍存在着许多问题，急待解决，如方针任务不明确，领导思想不一致，缺乏具体办法，领导关系混乱以及经费不足，学习时间与生产时间的矛盾等等。这次会议就是根据这种基础与要求召开的。会议的目的就是为了统一领导思想、明确方针任务、规定具体实施办法和步骤，改进领导关系，并尽可能地解决经费和学习时间等各项具体问题。
    三、这次会议，首先得到了毛主席、刘副主席关于方针上的指示，全体代表根据指示的精神，结合着当地情况与工作经验，进行了反复深入的讨论，批判了不正确的思想与观点，对下列各项方针原则问题，逐步达到了认识上的一致：
    （一）明确了加强工农教育的重大政治意义：它是巩固与发展人民民主专政、建立强大的国防军和强大的经济力量的必要条件；没有工农文化教育的普及和提高，也就没有文化建设的高潮。
    （二）根据当前国家的总情况和总任务，当前工农教育的实施方针应该是：在教育对象方面，必须首先着重对工农干部和积极分子的教育，并有条件地推广到有组织的男女青年和迫切要求学习的工农群众中去。在教育内容方面，当前一个时期，对工农干部、积极分子及已经完成了土地改革的农村农民和生产已经正常并进行过政治启蒙教育的工人应以文化教育（首先是识字）为主要内容，并适当地结合政治教育、生产技术教育和卫生教育。在新解放区和半老区，则一般地仍应与群众斗争相结合，与当时当地中心任务相结合，以政策时事教育为主要内容。轻视学习文化的观点和片面的强调学习文化的观点都是不正确的。在实施步骤方面，应该因时因地制宜，根据主客观条件，有重点地稳步前进，创造典型示范，逐步推广，在巩固的基础上求发展。目前在工农群众中只能积极推行识字教育，逐步减少文盲；还不能提出“全面扫除文盲”的口号。必须防止急于求成或只追求数字不讲求效果的形式主义偏向。
    （三）工农教育，是一个巨大的群众运动，必须贯彻群众路线。根据群众的自觉自愿，充分依靠群众自己的力量来进行工作。克服轻视工农群众，和对工农群众的恩赐观点及包办代替、命令主义的作风。工农群众教育经费，主要依靠群众自己解决，政府有重点地予以补助。师资问题，在识字教育的初级班中级班，以发动和组织群众教师和一切可能做教师的人们担任，实行以民教民为主的方针，必要与可能时，设一定的专任教师作为骨干。学习组织形式，必须根据当地实际情况与条件，适合群众的需要、可能与习惯，采取多种多样的形式，不能强求一律，不能强求正规化。
    （四）领导关系方面，必须实现“政府领导、依靠群众组织、各方面配合”的原则，以达到统一领导、分工合作，将工作做好的目的。克服本位主义，包办作风，但也不能推卸责任。所谓“你管我即不管，我管你就不能管”的想法是错误的。
    在上述方针原则问题上达到了一致，是这次会议的主要收获。
    四、根据上述方针原则，会议修正通过了：关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示，关于开展农民业余教育的指示，工农速成中学暂行实施办法，工农干部文化补习学校暂行实施办法，职工业余教育暂行实施办法，各级职工业余教育委员会组织条例等六项草案，将各种工农教育组织的任务、方针、制度、教学计划、师资、经费、领导关系等问题，都用法令的形式明文规定下来。关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示和职工业余教育委员会组织条例，拟提请中央人民政府政务院核准后公布，关于开展农民业余教育的指示和三个暂行实施办法，拟经中央人民政府政务院批准，由中央人民政府教育部公布。
    会后，各地区的代表根据大会决议，按当地情况与主客观条件，分别拟定了实施步骤和初步计划，确定了一九五一年开展工农教育的任务。
    五、还有两个问题，因牵涉范围很广，会议未作具体规定。一是工农干部在职学习问题，另一是举办使工农干部一面学文化、一面学业务的各种干部学校问题，拟请中央人民政府政务院召集各有关部门负责人会商解决。
    六、这次会议过程中，朱副主席、李副主席及政务院董、郭、黄各位副总理，全国总工会李副主席都向大会作报告，不仅给会议以方针上的指导，也给了代表们很大的鼓励。重工业部等有关部门及各人民团体的负责同志，也先后到会讲话，提供许多宝贵意见，并一致表示愿协力合作，尽可能帮助解决困难问题，贯彻大会的决议，大大提高了到会代表的工作信心，并给各地以良好的榜样。苏联专家介绍了苏联办工农中学、扫除文盲的经验，使会议有所借镜。这些都对会议的成功给了极大的帮助。
