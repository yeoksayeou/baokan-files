    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: Recently, US and Japanese reactionaries have been constantly directing shameless special agent thugs to attack the Japanese Communist Party headquarters in the Yoyogi district of Tokyo with despicable acts. For example, on the evening of October 20, special agents threw eggs, glass marbles, and stones at the JCP headquarters in multiple waves, while the police on duty in the area refused to stop this destructive action. On October 22, four special agents broke into the JCP headquarters, wantonly creating disturbances and cutting off the telephone lines.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd (TASS dispatch): Following MacArthur's orders of June 26 and July 18 this year to ban the Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the Japanese reactionary authorities have launched a large-scale police suppression campaign against all other democratic newspapers. According to reports from Tokyo, Tokyo police searched the editorial department of the progressive newspaper "Heiwano Tomo" (Friend of Peace), which has consistently defended peace and opposed the anti-people policies of the Japanese reactionary government. The Special Examination Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice has also ordered the indefinite closure of the newspaper. At the same time, the printing presses of four printing houses in Tokyo, including "Kyodo Seihan Insatsu-sho" (Joint Plate-Making Printing Plant), have also been sealed.

    美日特务袭击日共本部
    日反动当局继续迫害进步报纸
    【新华社讯】东京消息：美、日反动派最近不时指使无耻的特务暴徒，以卑劣的行为袭击东京代代木区的日本共产党本部。例如，十月二十日晚曾有特务多批轮流以鸡蛋、玻璃球、石块等物向日共本部投掷，而在当地值警的警察，对这种破坏行动竟拒予制止。十月二十二日又有特务四人闯进日共本部，恣意捣乱，并将电话线切断。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社上海二十二日电：继本年六月二十六日和七月十八日麦克阿瑟颁发关于封禁日本共产党中央机关报《赤旗报》的命令之后，日本反动当局又对所有其他的民主报纸发动了大规模的警察压制运动。据东京来讯称：东京警察曾搜查进步报纸《和平之友》报的编辑部，该报一贯是保卫和平与反对日本反动政府反人民的政策的。日本法务府特别审查局并已下令无限期封禁该报。同时，还封禁了包括“共同制版印刷所”在内的东京四家印刷所的印刷机。
