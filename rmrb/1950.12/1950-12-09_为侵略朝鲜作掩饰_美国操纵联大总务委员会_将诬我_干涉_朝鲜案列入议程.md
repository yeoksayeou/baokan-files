Xinhua News Agency, December 8th Dispatch from New York (TASS): The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on December 5th to examine the issue raised by the United States, Britain, France, Norway, Cuba, and Ecuador, concerning the inclusion of the so-called "Case of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Interfering in Korea" on the agenda. The explanatory memorandum submitted by the six countries groundlessly and stubbornly insisted that the army of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was fighting the United Nations forces in Korea; insisted that this issue had already been discussed in the Security Council, but due to the opposition of a permanent member—the Soviet Union—the aforementioned proposal could not be passed; and demanded that the General Assembly should examine this issue defaming the Chinese people as an "urgent and important" matter.

The US representative, Austin, spoke first, repeating the hypocritical arguments in the memorandum and demanding that the General Assembly discuss the six-nation proposal.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, spoke three times at the meeting. Vyshinsky pointed out that neither the memorandum nor the US representative had put forward any specific facts or practical motives sufficient to demonstrate that the United Nations General Assembly had the right to examine this issue. The proposers evaded these, because they had no facts, no materials to utilize. They attempted to falsely accuse the People's Republic of China of being an aggressor or invader, in order to cover up for the real invaders, the real aggressors—the United States.

Vyshinsky pointed out: The claim that the army of the People's Republic of China is interfering is false. It is inconsistent with the facts, because there are no Chinese troops in Korea. There is simply no intervention, but only the voluntary assistance of the Chinese people to their Korean brothers in their struggle to free themselves from the shackles of imperialism and to safeguard the security of their homeland. Vyshinsky reminded everyone to pay attention to how the American intervention in Korea threatened and violated the territorial integrity and political independence of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out: These illegal and criminal acts of the United States, which threaten China's security, have always been the cause of the Chinese people's justified anger. The fate of the Chinese people is closely related to the fate of the Korean people, so the Chinese people's voluntary assistance to Korea and resistance to American aggression is based on morality. Vyshinsky asked everyone to pay attention to the many documents of the Central People's Government of China proving that China had repeatedly expressed its desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. However, the American ruling clique is attempting to expand the war, because the main purpose of American aggression against Korea, just like the past Japanese imperialism, is not Korea, but China.

Vyshinsky exposed the falsehood in the memorandum that the so-called "interference" issue of the People's Republic of China had been discussed in the Security Council. He pointed out: In fact, the Security Council first considered the case of accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, and then the so-called "case of accusing aggression against the Republic of Korea." That is to say, none of the issues discussed by the Security Council mentioned the People's Republic of China. The proposals that were rejected by the Security Council due to the Soviet Union's opposition did not mention the "aggression" or "interference" of the People's Republic of China. The proposals mentioned the so-called "Communist military forces," but did not say that they were government troops. Therefore, it is unfounded to say that this issue has been dealt with by the Security Council.

Vyshinsky pointed out: It is procedurally incorrect for the memorandum to request the General Assembly to examine this issue as an "urgent and important" matter. He reminded everyone to pay attention to the fact that the Political Committee was about to continue discussing a very important motion, namely the "Soviet Union's accusation of American aggression against China." It is unprecedented to put this motion aside and discuss a new motion smuggled in through the back door.

Based on all of the above, Vyshinsky firmly opposed including the issue raised by the six-nation delegation on the agenda.

The Czechoslovak representative, Teolarata, also spoke against including this issue on the agenda. He pointed out: It is impossible to find a way to peacefully resolve the existing world crisis in the ever-increasing number of illegal resolutions attempting to cover up American aggression.

However, the United States manipulated the majority of the General Committee to pass the inclusion of the issue raised by the six countries on the agenda of the General Assembly. In the vote, fourteen votes were in favor, two votes (the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia) were against, and two votes (India and Iran) abstained.

### 为侵略朝鲜作掩饰  美国操纵联大总务委员会  将诬我“干涉”朝鲜案列入议程

    为侵略朝鲜作掩饰
    美国操纵联大总务委员会       
    将诬我“干涉”朝鲜案列入议程
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会十二月五日举行会议，审议美国、英国、法国、挪威、古巴及厄瓜多尔六国所提出的将所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”案列入议程的问题。六国提出的解释性备忘录毫无根据地硬说中华人民共和国中央人民政府的军队正在对朝鲜境内的联合国军队作战；硬说这个问题已经在安全理事会讨论过，但由于一个常任理事国——苏联——投票反对，未能通过上述提案；而要求大会把这个诽谤中国人民的问题作为一个“紧迫而重要的”问题加以审议。
    美国代表奥斯汀首先发言，他重复搬弄备忘录中的虚伪论据，要求大会讨论六国提案。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在会上三度发言。维辛斯基指出，不论备忘录或美国代表，都没有提出任何足以说明可使联合国大会有权利审议这一问题的具体事实或实际动机。提案人规避这些，因为他们没有事实，没有任何材料可资利用。他们企图把中华人民共和国硬说成是侵略者或入侵者，而为真正的入侵者、真正的侵略者——美国作掩饰。
    维辛斯基指出：所谓中华人民共和国军队进行干涉的说法是虚伪的。与事实不符的，因为朝鲜并没有中国的军队。根本就没有什么干涉，而只是中国人民志愿地援助他们的朝鲜兄弟为脱离帝国主义的羁绊而斗争，并保障自己祖国的安全。维辛斯基提醒大家注意美国干涉朝鲜如何威胁并侵犯了中华人民共和国的领土完整、政治独立。他指出：美国这些威胁中国安全的非法犯罪行为始终是中国人民正当愤怒的原因。中国人民的命运是与朝鲜人民的命运密切相关的，所以中国人民对朝鲜的志愿援助和对美国侵略的抵抗，是以道义为基础的。维辛斯基请大家注意中国中央人民政府的许多文件证明中国一再表示想和平解决朝鲜战争。但美国统治集团却企图扩大战争，因为美国侵略朝鲜，正同过去日本帝国主义一样，主要的目的不是朝鲜而是中国。
    维辛斯基揭穿备忘录中所谓中华人民共和国“干涉”问题曾在安理会讨论过的说法的虚伪性。他指出：事实上安理会首先考虑的是控诉美国武装侵略台湾案，其次是所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”，这就是说，安理会讨论过的问题中并没有提到中华人民共和国。在因苏联投票反对而为安理会所否决的提案中，也未说到中华人民共和国的“侵略”或“干涉”。提案中提到所谓“共产党军事部队”，但是并没有说他们是政府的军队。因此把这个问题说成已经安理会处理，是没有根据的。
    维辛斯基指出：备忘录中要求大会将这个问题作为“紧迫而重要的”问题加以审议，是不合程序的。他提醒大家注意政治委员会正要继续讨论一项非常重要的议案，即“苏联控诉美国侵略中国”案。把这个议案搁置起来，而去讨论从后门偷运进来的新的议案，是不曾有过前例的。
    根据上述一切，维辛斯基坚决反对把六国代表团所提出的问题列入议程。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表特奥拉塔也发言反对将这个问题列入议程。他指出：在不断增多力图掩饰美国侵略的非法决议中，是找不出和平解决现有世界危机的办法的。
    但是，美国操纵总务委员会的多数通过将六国所提出的问题列入大会议程。表决时，十四票赞成，两票（苏联及捷克斯洛伐克）反对，两票（印度和伊朗）弃权。
