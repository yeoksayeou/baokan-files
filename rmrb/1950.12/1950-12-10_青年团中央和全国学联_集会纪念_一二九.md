    The Communist Youth League Central Committee and All-China Students' Federation
    Hold Meeting to Commemorate "December 9th"
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation held a meeting in Beijing on the morning of the 9th to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. More than 900 staff and students from units such as the Communist Youth League Central Committee organs, the Central Communist Youth League School, the China Youth Art Theater, and the All-China Students' Federation attended the meeting. After a speech by Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, Yang Shu, Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, reported on the significance of the "December 9th" Movement. In narrating the course of this movement, he emphasized that the "December 9th" Movement was carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. China's patriotic youth responded to the great call of the Chinese Communist Party's "August 1st" Declaration and accepted the Party's proposition of a united front against Japanese aggression and the policy of combining intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers. This enabled the "December 9th" Movement to be conducted widely, deeply, and persistently. In his report, he cited the deeds of the youth in the "December 9th" Movement who joined the Chinese People's Army—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army—during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He finally emphasized that the "December 9th" Movement was a patriotic movement. Today, Chinese youth commemorate "December 9th" and should inherit the patriotic tradition of "December 9th," promote the spirit of patriotism, cultivate national self-esteem, enthusiastically participate in the glorious task of national defense construction, and contribute their strength to defending the motherland.

    青年团中央和全国学联
    集会纪念“一二九”
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国学生联合会于九日上午在北京集会纪念“一二九”运动十五周年。到会有青年团中央机关、中央团校、中国青年艺术剧院和全国学联等单位工作人员及学员九百余人。在青年团中央秘书长荣高棠致词后，青年团中央宣传部长杨述报告“一二九”运动的意义。他在叙述这一运动的经过中着重指出：“一二九”运动是在中国共产党的领导之下进行的。中国的爱国青年响应了中国共产党的“八一”宣言的伟大号召，接受了党的抗日民族统一战线的主张与知识分子和工农兵结合的方针。这样就使得“一二九”运动进行得广泛、深入与持久。在报告中他举出了“一二九”运动中的青年们在抗日战争中参加中国人民军队——八路军和新四军的事迹。他最后着重指出：“一二九”运动是爱国主义运动，今天中国青年纪念“一二九”，应该继承“一二九”爱国传统，发扬爱国主义精神，培养民族自尊心，踊跃参加国防建设的光荣任务，为保卫祖国贡献出自己的力量。
