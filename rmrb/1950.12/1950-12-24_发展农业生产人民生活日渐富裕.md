Developing Agricultural Production, People's Lives are Becoming Increasingly Prosperous

Zhejiang's Production Exceeds Plan by One and a Half Times

[Report from this newspaper] Zhejiang Province has achieved brilliant results in agricultural production this year. The province produced a total of 10.2 billion jin of grain this year, an increase of 1.6 billion jin over last year, exceeding the original plan of increasing by 600 million jin by more than one and a half times. The province's cotton production also increased by nearly two times compared to last year, totaling 280,000 dan. The output of other special products has also increased significantly. For example, jute production this year was 740,000 dan, an increase of 85% compared to the highest annual output of 400,000 dan in the past.

Fujian Can Be Self-Sufficient in Grain

[Report from this newspaper] According to the grain production figures for Fujian Province this year, the province can generally be self-sufficient next year. In the past, Fujian Province has always relied on imports of foreign rice and grain assistance from neighboring provinces. It is expected that next year only a small amount of grain assistance from neighboring provinces will be needed. This year, Fujian Province produced a total of 4.8 billion jin of rice, exceeding the original plan by 400 million jin; it produced a total of 3.97 billion jin of sweet potatoes, exceeding the original plan by 600 million jin. The production level has increased by 17% compared to last year.

The increase in grain production is a direct result of the people's government's efforts in agricultural production. The province has issued more than 7.4 million jin of rice in agricultural loans in the past year, and has vigorously mobilized the masses to manage water and eliminate pests.

Lu Shan County, Henan, Has Escaped Famine

[Report from this newspaper] In the three years since the liberation of Lu Shan County, Henan Province, especially after one year of production and construction after the completion of land reform, agricultural production in all areas of the county, except for the ninth district where work was poor and agricultural production only approached the pre-war level, has mostly exceeded the pre-war level. Before the war, the average yield per mu of land was 255 jin, before liberation the average yield per mu was 248 jin, and this year the average yield was 300 jin. In terms of livestock and agricultural tools, in 1936 the county had 20,876 head of livestock and 41,899 pieces of agricultural tools such as plows and rakes; in 1946, there were 18,933 head of livestock and 41,564 pieces of agricultural tools; this year, there are 21,598 head of livestock and 47,105 pieces of agricultural tools. This year, the county produced a total of 22.326 million jin of grain, exceeding the plan to increase production by 10%. After paying public grain, the average person has 550 jin, which can maintain a normal life for the whole year.

Throughout the year, 60% to 70% of households in the county have enough to eat and use, and 30% to 40% of households have surplus grain. The very few households that do not have enough to eat can also solve their problems through sideline production. The people of Lu Shan County have since escaped the historical famine, which is a gratifying major change in the lives of the people of Lu Shan.

Xu Jia Village, Yingkou County, Is Prospering with Both People and Wealth

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Jia Village in Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, used to be a poor village, but after land reform, it has now become a prosperous village with both people and wealth.

Before land reform, 22 of the 180 households in the village were long-term laborers. None of them could marry a wife. The 85 poor peasant households had only 150 mu of land. In addition to renting the landlord's bad land, the vast majority of them relied on income from odd jobs to make a living. The 58 middle peasant households also had only 200 mu of land. The total annual income of hired poor and middle peasants was less than 300 shi of grain; they also had only five carts and ten head of livestock.

Since land reform, they have escaped poverty and started on the road to prosperity. This year, the village's sideline production alone has generated 8.89 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below), which can buy more than 1,000 shi of grain. The village's 1,490 mu of land produced more than 1,300 shi of grain. With a population of 910 people, after deducting the annual food ration and public grain, there is still more than 1,000 shi of grain left. With more grain and good sideline production, the lives of the people in the village have generally improved. After the autumn harvest, the village bought more than 200 bolts of cloth and more than 200 pairs of rubber shoes. Now there is no one in the village wearing ragged clothes, and every family has a new quilt.

Livestock has greatly increased. Now the number of carts has increased to 25, and the number of livestock has increased to 50. Almost every family in the village raises pigs.

Not only has the wealth increased, but the population has also increased. All of the 22 former long-term laborers have now married wives. More than 40 people in the village have married since last year. There are now more than 40 infants under one month old in the village. With increased production and increased population, people are joyfully saying: Prosperity with both people and wealth, a double blessing!

Currently, in addition to preparing for next year's large-scale production, the village is also preparing to build new houses next year, because the population has increased and the houses are not enough. Facing these good days, the farmers said: This year is good, and next year we want it to be even better!

    发展农业生产人民生活日渐富裕
    浙江生产超过计划一倍半
    【本报讯】浙江省今年的农业生产获得辉煌成就。全省今年共生产粮食一百零二亿斤，比去年增产十六亿斤，较原定增产六亿斤的计划超过一倍半以上，全省皮棉的产量也比去年增加近两倍，计二十八万担。其他特产的产量也有很大增加。如黄麻今年产七十四万担，比过去最高年产量四十万担增加百分之八十五。
  福建粮食可以自给自足
    【本报讯】按照福建省今年所产粮食数字，该省明年大体可以自给自足。福建省过去一向依赖洋米进口和邻省接济粮食。预计明年只需邻省接济少量粮食即可。今年福建全省共产稻四十八亿斤，超过原订计划四亿斤；共产甘薯三十九亿七千万斤，超过原计划六亿斤。生产水平比去年提高了百分之十七。
    粮食增产是人民政府在农业生产方面努力的直接结果。该省一年来曾发放农业贷款七百四十多万斤稻米，并大力发动群众治水、除虫等。
  河南鲁山县已摆脱饥荒
    【本报讯】河南省鲁山县解放三年来，特别是经过完成土地改革后一年的生产建设，使全县除工作较差的九区农业生产仅接近战前水平外，其余地区已大都超过战前水平。战前每亩土地平均产量为二百五十五斤，解放前每亩平均产量为二百四十八斤，今年平均产量为三百斤；牲畜、农具方面，一九三六年全县牲畜为二万零八百七十六头，犁、耙等农具为四万一千八百九十九件，一九四六年牲畜为一万八千九百三十三头，农具为四万一千五百六十四件，今年牲畜为二万一千五百九十八头，农具四万七千一百零五件。全县今年共产粮二万二千三百二十六斤，超过了增产一成的计划，除缴公粮外，每人平均五百五十斤，可以维持全年的一般生活。
    全年，全县百分之六十至七十的户够吃够用，百分之三十到四十的户有余粮。极少数不够吃的户，从副业生产中也都能得到解决。鲁山县人民从此摆脱了历史性的饥荒，这是鲁山人民生活上的一个可喜的大转变。

  营口县徐家村人财两旺
    【本报讯】辽东省营口县徐家村过去是一个贫困村，但经过土地改革后，现在已变成人财两旺的富裕村了。
    在土地改革以前，全村一百八十户有二十二户扛大活。他们没有一人能娶上媳妇。八十五户贫农仅有土地一百五十亩，他们除了租种地主的坏地以外，绝大多数人在外依靠做零工的收入来糊口。五十八户中农也只有土地二百亩。雇贫中农全年总收入，还不足三百石粮；也只有五辆车和十头牲口。
    自从土地改革以后，他们脱离了贫困，开始走上富裕了。今年全村仅副业生产一项即收入八十八亿九百多万元（东北币，下同），能买粮一千多石。全村一千四百九十亩地，打了一千三百多石粮，全村人口九百一十人，按人口计算，除去全年的口粮和公粮以外，还能剩一千多石粮。粮食打得多，副业搞的好，全村人民的生活普遍上升。秋后全村买进二百多匹布，二百多双胶皮鞋。现在全村没有一个穿破衣服的人，家家有新被盖。
    牲畜大大增加。现大车已增到二十五辆，牲口已增到五十头，全村差不多家家养猪。
    不但财产增加，人口也随着增加了。过去二十二个扛大活的现在全都娶上了媳妇。全村从去年到现在结婚的有四十多个。现在全村不满一个月的婴儿有四十多个。生产提高，人口增加，人们都喜悦地说：人财两旺，喜上加喜。
    目前全村除了准备明年大生产外，并准备来年盖新房子，因为人口增加房子不够住了。农民们面对着这好日子说：今年好明年是更要它好！
