    Taking Current Affairs Learning a Step Further

    The current affairs learning movement, which has been unfolding across the country for the past two months, has already yielded extremely important results. Through this learning movement, the broad masses of the Chinese people have deeply understood the characteristics of the current situation, recognized the most vicious enemy of our motherland—the United States imperialists' sinister conspiracy to invade China—and thus launched a vigorous mass movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. That is to say, through this learning, those who were previously paralyzed by the idea of imperialist aggression are now alert; those who previously had illusions and incorrect ideas about U.S. imperialism have now begun to have a correct understanding. Pro-American reactionary ideas have been severely hit in this movement, and the confused ideas of some people who admired or feared the United States have also been corrected in this movement. And those who were originally more politically conscious have, in this movement, gained a clearer goal of struggle. In short, through this learning, the Chinese people have further armed themselves ideologically. Today, countless workers, peasants, on-the-job cadres, and young students are enthusiastic and striving to take various voluntary actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, even to the point of crossing the Yalu River to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and fight alongside the Korean People's Army. These heroic acts are based on this ideological awareness.

    Of course, this does not mean that we can be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. On the contrary, in order to enable the Chinese people to fight more powerfully against the vicious enemy, it is necessary for us to further raise our political consciousness.

    In order to achieve this goal, first of all, we should continue to adhere to current affairs learning and make it one of the regular and important contents of our future learning. We should recognize that the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is a relatively long-term patriotic movement. In the past few weeks, it was entirely necessary for many organizations to suspend other learning and for schools in some places to suspend regular classes in order to focus on current affairs learning and current affairs propaganda. But this approach cannot continue for a long time. In the future, we should regularly pay close attention to the development of current affairs, analyze the movements of the enemy, ourselves, and our friends, and collect various materials to further understand the enemy's aggression and conduct extensive propaganda to the broad masses. In carrying out this learning, we should regularly read various newspapers and periodicals, and in particular, we should be good at using the People's Daily in Beijing and the Current Affairs Handbook published in Beijing, treating them as the most important tools for learning current affairs, and regularly organizing reports and discussions on current affairs and political issues. In future current affairs learning, special attention should be paid to in-depth ideological education on resisting America, using the new understanding gained in learning as a weapon to criticize our own wrong ideas. Experience has shown that wherever criticism and self-criticism are carried out, the understanding of U.S. imperialism is profound.

    Secondly, we should raise our understanding of U.S. imperialism and the current international and domestic situation from the basis of perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. This is also an extremely important learning task. Because "the real task of knowledge lies not in perceptual knowledge, but in rational knowledge." At present, many people understand U.S. imperialism and the current international and domestic situation from many directly perceptible facts and phenomena. For example, from their own suffering, from the complaints of others, or from the various crimes of U.S. imperialism that they have witnessed, from the various reliable evidences and materials provided, they have come to understand the arrogance, brutality, insidiousness, corruption, and fragility of U.S. imperialism, as well as the path we should take. Of course, this kind of understanding derived from perceptible facts and materials is very solid and very precious, and it gives our understanding a very reliable foundation. But it is not enough to have only this kind of understanding; it is also necessary to take it a step further. That is to say, it is also necessary to further understand U.S. imperialism from the root, to understand the socio-economic system of U.S. imperialism, to understand this social system, to understand the laws of capitalist socio-economic development, to understand the stage that its development has reached, to understand the socio-economic basis for U.S. imperialism's inevitable conduct of various acts of aggression, and to understand the various contradictions that inevitably lead to its collapse and the development of these contradictions. Only in this way can we eradicate pro-American, admiration of America, and fear of America ideas from a solid theoretical basis, and establish a view of hating America, despising America, and scorning America. At the same time, we also need to further understand our era from the root, to understand the essence of the confrontation between the two major camps in the world today, to understand the inevitability of the rise of socialism and its complete victory and the decline of capitalism and its complete demise, and to understand the inevitable trend of the entire historical development. Only in this way can we clear away various confused ideas about the current world situation from a solid theoretical basis, establish our confidence in inevitable victory, and have a clear direction in various complex changes in the situation.

    Furthermore, in taking current affairs learning a step further, we should focus on the study of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of the state, and further understand the role of the people's state in resisting imperialist aggression, and thus understand the necessity of consolidating national defense and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship. This kind of learning should not be empty discussions divorced from reality, but should be closely combined with current actions. For example, in order to consolidate national defense, it is necessary to build a strong army, a strong air force, and a strong navy. Therefore, at a time when the motherland requires us to strengthen national defense, if conditions permit, a patriotic youth should regard it as his glorious responsibility to apply to military schools to study military affairs and join the people's armed forces. For example, in order to consolidate national defense and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, we must do our daily work well, because all revolutionary work directly or indirectly strengthens the revolutionary forces of the state. Only by closely combining the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country with the tasks of each person's own work post can revolutionary enthusiasm play a practical role.

    Finally, closely integrated with current affairs learning, we should also further deepen the study of the revolutionary worldview, and establish a view of serving the people without fear of difficulties and without hesitation to sacrifice. We should recognize that revolution is always an arduous task. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the result of a long-term arduous struggle over the past century. Today, in order to consolidate this victory and develop this victory, it naturally cannot be without paying a price. A revolutionary must be willing to make any sacrifice for the interests of the motherland. Today, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the frozen wilderness of North Korea, which is a model of such fearless self-sacrifice. Every Chinese person should pay tribute to and learn from these people's heroes, and those cowardly mentalities that are concerned about personal gains and losses and are afraid of difficulties should be analyzed and criticized in learning.

    The above is the effort we should make in order to take current affairs learning a step further.

### 把时事学习提高一步

专栏：

    把时事学习提高一步
    近两个月来在全国各地所展开的时事学习运动现在已经有了极重要的结果。广大的中国人民经过这一学习运动，深切地了解了目前形势的特点，认识了我们祖国最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义侵略中国的恶毒阴谋，从而掀起轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的群众运动。这就是说，经过这一学习，原先对帝国主义侵略存在着麻痹思想的人现在警觉起来了；原先对美帝国主义抱有幻想和错误想法的人，现在开始有了正确的认识。亲美的反动思想在这一运动中受到重大的打击，某一些人崇美、恐美的糊涂思想，也在这一运动中得到纠正。而原先政治觉悟较高的人，则在这一运动中，更加有了明确的奋斗目标。总之，经过这一学习，中国人民在思想上进一步武装起来了。今天无数工人、农民、在职干部、青年学生，激昂奋发，纷纷以各种志愿行动抗美援朝保家卫国，直到渡过鸭绿江参加中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军并肩作战等等英勇行为，就是建立在这一思想自觉的基础上的。
    当然这决不是说我们可以满足于已经获得的成就。恰恰相反，为了使中国人民更有力地与凶恶的敌人作坚决的斗争，我们有必要把自己的政治觉悟更加提高一步。
    为了达到这个目的，首先，我们应该继续坚持时事学习，使之成为今后经常的重要学习内容之一。我们应该认识到抗美援朝保家卫国运动是一个比较长期性的爱国运动。在过去数周内许多机关停止其他学习，有些地方的学校停止正课，专门进行时事学习与时事宣传是完全必要的。但这种方式不能长期地继续下去。今后我们应该经常密切注意时事的发展，分析敌、我、友的动向，和搜集各种材料，进一步认识敌人的侵略行为，并向广大群众进行广泛的宣传。在进行这一学习中我们应该经常阅读各种报章刊物，特别应该善于利用北京人民日报及北京出版的时事手册，把它当作学习时事最重要的工具，并经常组织时事政治问题的报告和讨论。在今后的时事学习中，特别应该注意深入抗美的思想教育，以在学习中所获得的新的认识，当作武器来批判自己的错误思想。经验证明：凡是展开批评和自我批评的地方，对美帝国主义的认识就深刻。
    其次，我们应该把美帝国主义与目前国际国内形势的认识从感性知识的基础上提高到理性的认识。这也是一项极其重要的学习任务。因为“认识的真正任务不在感性的认识，而在理性的认识”。目前很多人从许多直接可以感触得到的事实和现象上认识了美帝国主义和目前国际国内形势。譬如说，从自己身受的痛苦，从别人的诉苦或从自己亲眼见到的美帝国主义的各种罪行，从提供出来的各种确实证据与材料上认识了美帝国主义的专横、残暴、阴险、腐朽、脆弱以及我们自己应走的道路。当然，这种从可以感触到的事实和材料中得来的认识是很巩固的，很可宝贵的，它使我们的认识有了极可靠的基础。但仅仅有了这样的认识还是不够的，还需要在这个基础上提高一步。就是说，还需要进一步从根本上来认识美帝国主义，认识美帝国主义的社会经济制度，认识这个社会制度，认识资本主义社会经济发展的规律，认识它的发展所已经达到的阶段，认识美帝国主义必然进行各种侵略活动的社会经济基础，认识必然促使它崩溃的各种矛盾和这些矛盾的发展。这样才可以使我们从坚实的理论基础上来肃清亲美、崇美、恐美的思想，建立起仇美、蔑美、鄙美的观点。同时，我们也需要进一步从根本上来认识我们的时代，认识目前世界上两大阵营对立的本质，认识社会主义上升及其完全胜利与资本主义没落及其完全灭亡的必然性，认识整个历史发展的必然趋势。这样才可以使我们从坚实的理论基础上来扫清对目前世界局势的各种糊涂观念，建立起我们必然胜利的信心，使我们在各种复杂的局势变动中有明确的方针。
    再其次，把时事学习提高一步中，我们应该着重马列主义关于国家学说的学习，进一步认识人民国家在抵抗帝国主义侵略中的作用，因而认识巩固国防，加强人民民主专政的必要。这种学习不应该是脱离实际的空洞的议论，而应该和当前的行动密切结合起来。例如，为了巩固国防，就要建设强大的陆军，强大的空军，强大的海军，那么在祖国要求我们加强国防的时刻，如果条件许可，一个爱国青年就应该把投考军事学校学习军事，投身到人民武装队伍中去当作自己光荣的责任。又例如，为了巩固国防，加强人民民主专政，我们就要把日常工作做好，因为一切革命工作都是直接间接加强国家革命力量的。只有使抗美援朝保家卫国的运动和每个人本身工作岗位的任务密切结合起来，才能使革命热情发挥实际的作用。
    最后，与时事学习密切相结合的，我们还应该进一步深入关于革命人生观的学习，树立不怕困难，不惜牺牲的为人民服务的观点。我们应该认识到革命总是一件艰苦的工作。中国革命之所以获得胜利是百年来长期艰苦奋斗的结果。今天为了巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利，自然也不能是不付代价的。一个革命者为了祖国的利益就要不惜任何牺牲。今天中国人民志愿部队在北朝鲜的冰天雪地中与敌人激烈的战斗，就是这种大无畏自我牺牲的模范。每个中国人民都应该向这些人民的英雄致敬和学习，而那些患得患失，害怕困难的懦怯心理是应该在学习中加以分析和批判的。
    以上就是为了把时事学习提高一步我们应作的努力。
