    Great Educational Significance
    Like "Liberated China," "The Victory of the Chinese People" is a highly ideological and artistically colorful documentary; these two films together demonstrate the noble qualities of the hardworking and courageous Chinese people and their brilliant victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, marching forward with a high degree of awareness and confidence towards the great cause of building the motherland.
    "Liberated China" will tell tens of millions of viewers around the world how the Chinese people have been strong and unyielding, advancing wave upon wave, for their liberation for a hundred years, but only after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party did the Chinese people have correct leadership, recognize the goals of the struggle, and step by step embark on the road to victory.
    "Liberated China" will also tell tens of millions of viewers around the world that the Chinese people, who have been victorious and liberated, are building their motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm. In a very short period, significant and commendable achievements have been made in industrial, agricultural, cultural, educational, and other fields. The liberated Chinese people are displaying their high level of wisdom and hardworking, courageous qualities, determined to complete the huge construction tasks in the shortest possible time—the tasks of industrialization that capitalist countries took a hundred years to accomplish.
    "Liberated China" will undoubtedly play a huge educational role for tens of millions of Chinese viewers. This is a history of the Chinese people's struggle and a history of the founding of the People's Republic of China through the art of film. This will awaken the high sense of self-esteem and patriotic enthusiasm of the 475 million hardworking and courageous people, and it will inspire the broad masses of all strata of our country with confidence in building the motherland, passionate love for our leaders, and enthusiastic support for the Chinese Communist Party that leads the Chinese people to victory!
    Today, as our nation’s most ferocious and final enemy—U.S. imperialism—launches further armed aggression against us, the premiere of "Liberated China" is of even greater significance. The people of the whole country will more profoundly realize that without defeating U.S. imperialism, our victory cannot be consolidated, and our bright future cannot be realized; the people of the whole country will also more profoundly realize that the Chinese Communist Party, which led the people to turn themselves over, will certainly also lead us to achieve final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression; the people of the whole country will strengthen unity and resist U.S. imperialist aggression with infinite confidence, and our struggle will never stop until the final victory!
    The people of "Liberated China" are determined not to allow imperialism to invade again!

    巨大的教育意义
    《解放了的中国》正和《中国人民的胜利》一样，是具有高度思想性和艺术性的五彩纪录片；这两部影片合起来，就表现了中国人民勤劳英勇的高贵品质，及其在共产党领导下进行反帝反封建的斗争而取得的辉煌的胜利，并以高度的自觉和信心，向建设祖国的伟大事业大步迈进。
    《解放了的中国》将告诉全世界万万千千的观众：百年以来，中国人民曾经怎样地坚强不屈，前仆后继，为自己的解放而斗争，但是直到中国共产党成立以后，中国人民才有了正确的领导，才认清了斗争的目标，才一步一步走上胜利的道路。
    《解放了的中国》又将告诉全世界万万千千的观众：胜利了解放了的中国人民正在以无比的热忱建设自己的祖国。在极短的时间内，工业、农业、文化、教育等等方面的建设，便已经有了显著的值得夸耀的成就。解放了的中国人民正在发挥它的高度的智慧和勤劳勇敢的品质，决心要在最短的时间内完成巨大的建设任务，——这就是资本主义国家用了百年的时间方能达成的工业化的任务。
    《解放了的中国》对于万万千千的中国观众，无疑地也将起着巨大的教育作用。这是通过电影艺术的一部中国人民斗争史，一部中华人民共和国的建国史。这将唤起四万七千五百万勤劳勇敢的人民的高度的自尊心和爱国热忱，这将激发我国的各阶层的广大人民对于建设祖国的信心，对于我们的领袖的热烈的敬爱，对于领导中国人民走向胜利的中国共产党热烈的拥护！
    正当我们民族的最凶恶的也是最后的一个敌人——美帝国主义向我们发动进一步的武装侵略的今天，《解放了的中国》的公演，更具有重大的意义。全国人民将更加深刻地认识到：不打倒美帝，我们的胜利就不能巩固，我们的美好的将来就不能实现；全国人民也将更加深刻地认识到：领导人民翻了身的中国共产党一定也将领导我们在反抗美帝侵略的斗争中取得最后的胜利；全国人民将加紧团结，以无限的信心反抗美帝的侵略，不到最后的胜利，我们的斗争决不中止！
    《解放了的中国》的人民是决定不容许帝国主义再来侵略的！
