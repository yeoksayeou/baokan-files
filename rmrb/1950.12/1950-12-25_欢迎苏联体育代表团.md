    Welcome Soviet Sports Delegation
    The Soviet sports delegation, led by Romanov, Director of the Sports School Department of the Committee for Physical Culture and Sports Affairs under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, arrived in Beijing yesterday. The delegation's mission is to visit China. The delegation's basketball team will hold friendly exhibition matches with local basketball teams in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Harbin. The Chinese people and all sports workers welcome the arrival of the Soviet sports delegation with extremely warm feelings.
    Soviet sports, over the past thirty-three years, have achieved great success, reaching the highest level in the world. This is a result of the superiority of the socialist social system and the promotion and leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government. The Soviet Union regards sports as an important part of communist education, used to cultivate the fine qualities of the Soviet people, prepare the physical and mental conditions for productive labor and defending the motherland, and accelerate the realization of a communist society.
    In the Soviet Union, sports have become an indispensable and important part of the lives of the vast majority of people, and millions of working people have plunged into the upsurge of sports activities. The unprecedented popularity of sports activities and the extremely high standards of athletic performance have made the Soviet Union the most advanced country in the world in sports.
    Just as we should learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience in economic and cultural aspects, we must also learn from the Soviet Union's successful experience in sports. The visit to the Soviet Union by the Chinese sports delegation, which returned home not long ago, was the beginning of our learning from the Soviet Union in sports. In the future, China's sports work must systematically learn from the Soviet Union, in a planned and step-by-step manner, combined with China's specific conditions, to develop the sports movement of New China and implement the policy of promoting national sports stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The visit of the Soviet sports delegation to China is the first time that the Soviet sports community has come to China, which will undoubtedly have a great impact on China's sports cause.
    In the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, the people of the whole country should take this opportunity to further recognize the importance of purposeful, led, and mass sports. We should be good at using sports to exercise the bodies of the broad masses of people and cultivate a strong spirit, so as to better serve production and national defense.

    欢迎苏联体育代表团
    由苏联部长会议体育运动事务委员会体育学校部部长罗曼诺夫率领的苏联体育代表团已于昨日抵京。代表团的任务是访问中国。代表团的篮球队将在北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、广州、沈阳、哈尔滨等城市，与我国各地篮球队作友谊表演比赛。中国人民和全体体育工作者们都怀着极其热烈的心情，欢迎苏联体育代表团的到来。
    苏联体育事业，三十三年来已经获得极大的成就，达到全世界最高的水平。这是由于社会主义社会制度的优越性，联共（布）党和苏维埃政府提倡与领导的结果。苏联是把体育作为共产主义教育的一个重要部分，用来培养苏维埃人民的优良品质，准备生产劳动和捍卫祖国的身体和精神条件，加速争取共产主义社会的实现。
    在苏联，体育已经成为广大人民生活中不可缺少的重要部分，千百万的劳动人民都投入了体育运动的热潮中。体育活动的空前的普及和运动成绩的极高的水准，已使苏联成为世界上体育最先进的国家。
    正像我们在经济、文化各方面应当学习苏联的建设经验一样，在体育运动方面，我们也必须学习苏联的成功经验。不久以前回国的中国体育访问团在苏联的访问，就是我们向苏联学习体育的一个开端。今后的中国体育工作，必须要有计划、有步骤、有系统地结合中国具体情况向苏联学习，以开展新中国的体育运动，实践人民政协共同纲领所规定的提倡国民体育的方针。
    苏联体育代表团的来华访问，是苏联体育界到中国来的第一次，这无疑将给中国体育事业以极大的影响。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动中，全国人民应该借此进一步认识有正确目的的、有领导的、群众性的体育运动的重要性。我们应当善于运用体育运动来锻炼广大人民的身体，培养坚强的精神，以便更好地为生产和国防服务。
