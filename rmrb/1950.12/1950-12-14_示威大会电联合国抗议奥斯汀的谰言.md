    Demonstration Rally Sends Telegram to the United Nations Protesting Austin's Slanders
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 13th] The Beijing Church Groups, Schools, Hospitals and Returned Students from the United States Anti-Austin Slander Demonstration Parade Assembly sent a protest telegram to the United Nations. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations at Success Lake, and to all representatives of the Security Council:
    We, the more than 40,000 faculty, staff, and students of various churches and church organizations, church schools, and church hospitals in Beijing, as well as returned students from the United States, today with unparalleled anger, protest against the shameless slanders made by the representative of the United States government, the mouthpiece of Wall Street, the war-monger Austin, at the Security Council on November 28th, who slandered the Chinese people. The Chinese people of today have stood up. Through our own personal experience over the years, we have a deeper understanding of the insidious cunning of the American imperialists. This time, Austin, in order to cover up the failure of the bloody aggression of the American imperialists, wantonly slandered the Chinese people, and we protest. The American imperialists use the means of running churches, schools, and hospitals in China to promote the conspiracy of cultural aggression, and we protest. The American imperialists extorted huge amounts of reparations and hypocritically returned a small portion as capital for expanding cultural aggression, and we protest. The American imperialists, using imperialist privileges in China, using their military force, their money, and employing all kinds of sugar-coated methods, spread the poison of the so-called American way of life in China, and we protest. In order to answer Austin's shameless slanders, in order to express our protest with practical actions, we will use our greatest strength to participate in the People's Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea; we must liberate our territory, Taiwan Province. Finally, we want to call on the people of all of China and unite with all peace-loving people of all countries, including the American people, to deliver a fatal blow to the American imperialists' acts of aggression around the world.

    示威大会电联合国抗议奥斯汀的谰言
    【新华社十三日讯】北京市教会团体、学校、医院及留美学生反奥斯汀诬蔑示威游行大会致联合国抗议电，电文如下：成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生转安全理事会全体代表：
    我们北京市的各教会及教会团体，教会学校，教会医院等员生及留美学生共四万余人，今天以无比的愤怒，抗议美国政府代表，华尔街的代言人，战争贩子奥斯汀十一月二十八日在安理会所发表的诬蔑中国人民的无耻谰言。今天的中国人民已经站起来了，我们由于多年来的亲身体验，更深刻的认识到美帝国主义者的阴险狡诈。这次奥斯汀为了掩饰美帝国主义者血腥侵略的失败，肆意地诬蔑中国人民，我们抗议。美帝用在中国办教会，办学校，办医院的手段，推行文化侵略的阴谋，我们抗议。美帝勒索了巨额的赔款，假仁假义地退回一小部分，作为扩大文化侵略的资本，我们抗议。美帝用帝国主义在中国的特权，用他的武力，他的金钱，玩弄了种种糖衣式的手段，在中国散布所谓美国生活方式的毒药，我们抗议。为了答复奥斯汀的无耻谰言，为了用实际行动表示我们的抗议，我们要用最大的力量，参加人民志愿的抗美援朝运动；我们一定要解放我们的国土台湾省。最后，我们要号召全中国的人民，并联合一切爱好和平的各国人民，包括美国人民在内，对于美帝在全世界的侵略行为，予以致命的打击。
