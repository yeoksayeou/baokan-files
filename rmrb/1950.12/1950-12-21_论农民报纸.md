    On Peasant Newspapers
    Editor's Note: This issue of "Journalism" answers Comrade Zeng Yanxiu's letter regarding whether or not peasant newspapers should be published. To help readers understand this issue, we have selected and translated several essays by Stalin and Kalinin on peasant newspapers from the "Bolshevik Press" collection. In addition, Molotov and Kirov's essays also expressed important opinions on peasant newspapers, but due to translation delays, they will be published in the next issue.

    To "Peasant Newspaper"
    Stalin
    Greetings to "Peasant Newspaper," a faithful defender of the great cause of the worker-peasant alliance!
    "Peasant Newspaper"! Remember three commandments:
    (1) Cherish your rural correspondents as you cherish the apple of your eye – they are your troops.
    (2) Connect more closely with the most loyal and most conscious peasants, especially those who have been Red Army soldiers – they are your pillars.
    (3) Spread the truth in the countryside, and proclaim to the world, constantly proclaim, that without an alliance with our worker brothers, the liberation of the peasantry is unimaginable; without the leadership of the workers over the peasants, labor cannot triumph over capital.
    (Published in "Peasant Newspaper," No. 51, November 17, 1924)

    Greetings to "Peasant Newspaper"
    Kalinin
    Greetings to "Peasant Newspaper," a new fighter in the struggle against the darkness and ignorance of the countryside.
    Currently, as a labor upsurge to rebuild the economy destroyed in the years of the imperialist war and civil war sweeps through our worker-peasant Soviet Republic, and as extremely significant events unfold in Western Europe, the necessity of creating newspapers for the peasants is felt particularly sharply.
    Such newspapers should illuminate peasant life and practically help peasants understand economic, land, judicial, and other issues. Special attention should be paid in the newspaper to the struggle against malfeasance and all other dark aspects of rural life.
    In addition, the newspaper should explain to the peasants the full significance of current international events and their close connection with the life of our republic.
    This is the task facing such a newspaper.
    I sincerely hope that "Peasant Newspaper" will thoroughly accomplish these tasks. With Bolshevik greetings!
        (Published in "Peasant Newspaper," No. 1, October 25, 1923)

  Publishing Festival and Peasant Newspapers
  Kalinin
    Among the peasants, only a few must know where our Publishing Festival came from and when it began.
    Fully ten years ago, during the era of autocracy (1912), the first Bolshevik newspaper, "Pravda," held many mass meetings in the workers' districts of Petrograd on the day of its second anniversary. At these meetings, our speakers, under the surveillance of military police, gave speeches on the workers' press, they talked about the great significance of the press as a weapon for the working class to liberate itself, and that workers must support their newspaper "Pravda."
    Many people risked police repression to attend the meetings, and the workers were filled with sympathy for the meetings. Under the gnashing hatred of the bourgeoisie and its servants, "Pravda" still received the love and material assistance of the proletariat at these meetings.
    This was also the first day of the workers' press.
    The Tsarist regime, frightened by the growing influence of the Bolshevik "Pravda" on the working masses, confiscated almost every issue of the newspaper and soon decided to shut it down completely.
    Now it has been ten years. Since 1917, "Pravda" has grown stronger, but it is no longer a leaflet forced into the underground, but a free and great platform of the victorious proletarian revolution.
    However, wherever there is a victorious workers' press existing and active, there is a peasant press existing and active. The October Revolution, in which the workers' "Pravda" played a great historical role at that time, gave the peasant press the possibility of existence and work.
    Today, which we commemorate every year, we should look back at our press work and see if we have all done it, whether we have grasped this great weapon that we are building in the hands of the broad masses, and hit the target more accurately year after year.
    The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party wrote in its call for the Publishing Festival: "Special attention must be paid to the peasant press." And it is very clear: regarding the peasant press, the call correctly points out—"The smallest achievement is the most significant thing, because every newspaper that reaches the countryside is for connecting the city and the countryside." And this connection is the consolidation of urban-rural cooperation, the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, which is the most important work of our revolution.
    So what is the situation of our peasant press? Undoubtedly, we have achieved great results in the past year. First of all, it can be seen from the oldest and best rural daily, "Bednota".
    A year ago, it only had individual subscribers in the countryside. After the collection of subscription fees was changed, the impoverished countryside put it in a difficult situation. If we do not count the subscribers of various central organizations and agencies, then a year ago the newspaper had less than seven thousand peasant subscribers.
    Last autumn, this number increased to thirty thousand. Today, almost all of the newspaper's 60,000 copies are from local peasant subscribers.
    Whoever understands rural conditions, and not only understands the living habits of the peasants, but also understands the rural transportation conditions, especially the relatively high price, understands what a great achievement "Bednota" has achieved as a daily publication.
    This growth of "Bednota" proves better than any argument that we have done a lot of work to make the countryside truly interested in newspapers and to make it feel a constant need for newspapers.
    At the same time, the active connection between readers and the editorial department has also been strengthened. Not only as exposers of the chaos of the Soviet order, but also as participants in the discussion of local and national issues raised by life, peasant advanced elements and peasant social activists have also begun to play a huge role in the newspaper.
    Under such conditions, the peasant press should be, like our press, a school and collector of rural public opinion in the countryside—in this sense, the role of "Bednota" is particularly important.
    In pointing out the achievements that have been made, it is clear that we cannot forget that we still have a lot of work to do to promote newspapers further and make newspapers penetrate deeper into the peasant masses. If the daily "Bednota", which is priced higher, can win such an important position, then it will be easier for the weekly "Peasant Newspaper", which is cheaper and more suitable for groups with lower levels of knowledge, to penetrate into the countryside. "Bednota"'s younger brother has a dual important task: first, to send newspapers to places where there are the fewest newspapers, or to places where there are no newspapers at all…, and second, to gradually cultivate the need for newspapers, and prepare and develop audiences for daily newspapers in the countryside.
    Therefore, any achievement of "Peasant Newspaper" is very important to us. Similarly, it also achieved great results last year: now the newspaper has a circulation of more than 200,000 copies.
    Undoubtedly, next year will bring us not small but big achievements. In particular, I hope that this year the editorial department of "Bednota" can increase the number of subscribers to 100,000, which shows that the distance between the newspaper and the advanced stratum of peasants is getting closer and closer. This approach has been fully explained in the newspaper. We see that every issue raised by "Bednota" has aroused enthusiastic discussions among the peasants. Readers who can critically treat what he has read and can express his opinions in the newspaper will believe that the editorial department will carefully consider his opinions, and such readers will become friends of the newspaper and its best guides to the masses.
    Not long ago, "Bednota" turned six years old. This is—six years of service to the peasants, six years of work for the worker-peasant alliance. For six years, "Bednota" has fought together with the peasants for the right to life and the continued existence of the Soviet regime. This glorious work—cannot be unrecognized by the peasant masses. In fact, "Bednota" slowly (because the peasants themselves change very slowly) but steadily and increasingly widely promoted the scope of the audience.
    Its subscribers and readers should have certain characteristics—he is a producer who is very concerned about agriculture, and his main task is to develop and improve our agriculture and the cultural level of our countryside. I sincerely congratulate the editorial department on the sixth anniversary of the newspaper and wish it future success in its work.

专栏：

    论农民报纸
    编者按：“新闻工作”本期回答了曾彦修同志关于应否办农民报纸的来信。为了帮助读者了解这个问题，特选译了“布尔什维克报刊”文集所载斯大林和加里宁关于农民报纸的几篇论文。此外还有莫洛托夫和基洛夫的论文都对农民报纸发表了重要的意见，因翻译来不及，俟下期续刊。
    给“农民报”
    斯大林
    向工农联盟的伟大事业的忠实的保卫者“农民报”致敬！
    “农民报”！牢记三条诫律：
    （一）爱护自己的农村通讯员，如同爱护眼珠一样，——这是你的队伍。
    （二）与最忠实的和最有觉悟的特别是与当过红军战士的农民们更加密切地联系起来，——这是你的支柱。
    （三）在农村中传播真理，并向全世界鼓吹，不停地鼓吹，没有与工人的兄弟的联盟，农民的解放是不可想像的；没有工人对农民的领导，劳动战胜资本也是不可能的。
    （载“农民报”第五十一期。一九二四年十一月十七日）
    给“农民报”的祝词
    加里宁
    向作为与农村的黑暗和无知进行斗争的新战士“农民报”致敬。
    目前，当重建在帝国主义战争和内战的年代中所破坏了的经济的劳动高潮弥漫了我们的工农苏维埃共和国的时候，又当西欧展开了非常重大事件的时候，——特别尖锐地感受了为农民创办报纸的必要性。
    这种报纸应当阐明农民生活，切实帮助农民了解经济、土地、司法等问题。在报纸上应当特别注意与农村生活中的渎职和一切其他的黑暗面作斗争。
    除此以外，报纸应该向农民阐明目前所发生的国际事件的全部意义及其与我们共和国的生活的密切联系。
    这种报纸所面临的任务就在于此。
    我恳切地希望“农民报”彻底实现这些任务。致以布尔什维克的敬礼！
          （载“农民报”第一期。一九二三年十月二十五日）
  出版节和农民报纸
  加里宁
    在农民中，一定只有个别的人知道从那里产生了我们的出版节和它是从什么时候开始的。
    整整十年以前，还在专制时代（一九一二年）产生的第一个布尔什维克报纸“真理报”，在它的两周年纪念那一天，在彼得堡工人区里举行了许多群众大会。在这些会议上，我们的演说家在军警监视下发表关于工人报刊的演说，他们谈到作为工人阶级解放自己的斗争武器的报刊的巨大意义和工人必须支持自己的报纸“真理报”。
    冒着警察镇压的危险而参加会议的人是很多的，工人对会议充满着同情，“真理报”在资产阶级及其奴仆的切齿痛恨之下，仍然在这些会议上获得无产阶级的爱戴和物质上的援助。
    这也就是工人报刊的第一日。
    为布尔什维克“真理报”对工人群众的日益增长的影响而吓倒了的沙皇政权，几乎把该报每一期都全部没收，很快就决定彻底闭死它。
    到现在已经十年了。从一九一七年起，“真理报”已经壮大起来了，但是已经不是一个被迫为地下的传单而是胜利了的无产阶级革命的自由和伟大的讲坛了。
    然而凡是在有胜利了的工人报刊存在和活动着的地方，就有农民报刊存在和活动着。工人的“真理报”在当时起了伟大历史作用的十月革命，给予农民报刊以存在和工作的可能性。
    现在在我们每年纪念着的今天里，我们应当回顾一下我们的报刊工作，并看一看我们是否都作到了，是否已把我们建设中的这一伟大武器掌握在广泛群众的手中，而且一年比一年更准确地打中靶子。
    俄国共产党中央委员会在出版节的号召中写道：“必须特别注意农民报刊。”而且很明白：关于农民报刊，在号召中很正确地指出——“最小的成就都是最重大的事情，因为到达农村的每一张报纸都是为了把城市和农村联系起来的。”而这一联系即是城乡合作的巩固，工农联盟的巩固，也就是我们革命中最主要的工作。
    那么我们的农民报刊的情况是怎样的呢？无疑地，在去年一年中我们获得了很大的成绩。首先从最老的和最好的农村的日报“贫农报”可以看得到。
    一年以前它在农村中只有个别的订户。改收报费以后，贫困的农村就把它陷入了困难的境地。如果不算各中央组织和机关的订户，那么一年以前该报农民订户还不到七千人。
    在去年秋季，这个数字增加到了三万。到今天，该报的六万份便几乎全是各地方的农民订户了。
    谁了解农村条件，而且不只是了解农民的生活习惯，还了解农村的交通条件，特别是价钱又比较高，谁便懂得作为每日出版物的“贫农报”所得到的该是一个多么大的成绩。
    “贫农报”的这种增长，比任何议论都更好地证实我们已经做了许多工作，使得农村真正地对报纸发生了兴趣，使得它对报纸感到经常的需要。
    同时，在读者与编辑部之间的积极联系也巩固起来了。不只作为苏维埃秩序混乱的揭发者，而且也作为生活所提出的有关地方和全国问题的讨论的参予者的农民先进分子和农民社会活动家，在报纸上也开始起着巨大作用。
    在这种条件下，农民报刊在农村中应该与我们的报刊一样，是农村舆论的学校和收集者，——在这个意义上，“贫农报”的作用特别重大。
    在指出已经达到的成绩时，显然地，我们也不能忘记，我们还要做许多工作，把报纸推广得更远，使报纸更加深入到农民群众中去。如果定价较高的日报“贫农报”能争取到这样重要的阵地，那么对比较便宜的更适合于知识水准低的阶层的周报“农民报”来说，就更加容易深入到农村中去了。“贫农报”的小兄弟有着双重重要任务：第一，把报纸送到报纸最少的地方，或者送到完全没有报纸的地方去………，第二，逐渐培养对报纸的需要，在农村中为日报准备和发展听众。
    因此“农民报”的任何成绩对于我们都是非常重要的，同样地去年它也达到了巨大的成绩：现在该报发行数已超过二十万份了。
    无疑地，明年将带给我们不是小的而是大的成绩。特别是我希望在今年“贫农报”编辑部能够把订户增加到十万人，这一点说明报纸与农民的先进阶层之间的距离日益接近了。这一接近在报纸上已充分说明了。我们看到“贫农报”所提出的每一个问题都引起了农民的热烈的讨论。能够批判地对待他所读过的东西，并且能够在报纸上发表意见的读者，将会相信编辑部会慎重考虑他的意见，这样的读者将会成为报纸的朋友和它深入群众的最好的向导者。
    不久前，“贫农报”满了六周年。这是——服务于农民的六周年，为工农联盟工作的六周年。六年来“贫农报”与农民共同为生活权利、苏维埃政权的继续存在而斗争。这一光荣的工作——是不能不为农民群众所认识的。事实上“贫农报”慢慢地（因为农民本身就改变得很慢）然而坚定地日益广泛地推广了听众的范围。
    它的订户和读者应当具备某些特点，——他是非常关心农业的生产者，他的主要任务是发展、提高我们的农业和我们的农村的文化水平。我恳切地向编辑部祝贺本报的六周年纪念日，并愿它在自己的工作范围内获得未来的成功。
            一九二四年四月三十日
        （载“贫农报”第一八○二期。一九二四年五月四日）
