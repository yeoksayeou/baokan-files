    “Dollars Cannot Buy the Hearts of the Chinese People!”
    By our reporter He Li
    The Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace became today a grand gathering place for Beijing's church schools, church organizations, and students who had studied in the United States, all united against American imperialist cultural aggression. Filled with righteous indignation, they crowded the courtyard and packed the surrounding corridors. The courtyard was filled with a forest of raised arms, and tens of thousands of voices shouted: "Protest against Austin's insult to the Chinese people!" "Oppose slander! Oppose deception! Oppose insult!" "Smash American imperialist cultural aggression!"
    Austin shamelessly insulted China's church schools, church organizations, and students who had studied in the United States. He said in the Security Council that "one-eighth of all Chinese university graduates had been educated in one or more of the thirteen universities established by American Protestant missionary societies." "Ten thousand people have received university education in the United States." In addition: "It is estimated that more than 250,000 Chinese students have graduated from primary and secondary schools in China that were funded by the United States." Austin boasted that this was American imperialism's "friendship" towards the Chinese people. What kind of "friendship" is this really? Listen to the accusations of the people who attended today's meeting:
    Professor Pan Guangdan said indignantly: "Many of us in the past suffered from 'American sickness,' worshiping America's 'material civilization' and 'American way of life,' and our spiritual and material lives were麻醉ed by American imperialism." He said humorously, "Austin, this doctor, has sobered us up. Now we know that American imperialist cultural aggression is a highly profitable business."
    Wang Wei, a student from Class Two of Yucai High School, said angrily: "The church schools run by American imperialism insisted that students study English and pray, and created an atmosphere of 'America is superior to everything,' which almost made students forget that they are Chinese."
    More than a hundred students who had studied in the United States from the Ministry of Education's Overseas Students Reception Center and the Revolutionary University Political Research Institute, all returned to China this year. They were all subjected to coercion, enticement, and various forms of obstruction by American imperialism when they returned home. They all resented the "friendship" given to them by American imperialism. Tsinghua University professors Feng Youlan, Wu Jingchao, Lei Haizong, Li Jidong, and others were all students who had studied in the United States thirty years ago. They all exposed the purpose of American imperialism in training Chinese students: to cultivate pro-American factions politically, to expand markets economically, and to capture the souls of the Chinese people culturally and ideologically. Zhang Yun, the Dean of Studies at Peking Union Medical College, said simply and powerfully: "Our actions today are to let American imperialism know that its money cannot buy everything!"
    American imperialism's despicable "friendship" aroused the hatred and contempt of this great crowd.
    The procession set off. The students of Yenching University held aloft a large banner: "Dollars cannot buy the conscience of the Chinese people!" and shouted the slogan "Down with American imperialism!" Tsinghua University was established with the "Boxer Indemnity" plundered by American imperialism with guns and cannons. This is also the "friendship" that Austin advertised. Today, the students of Tsinghua University carried a cartoon with the words: "Bah! Austin, shut your mouth!" The procession from Fu Jen Catholic University carried an American paper tiger.
    Many religious organizations carried the banner of "Firmly Establish Self-Governance, Self-Support, and Self-Propagation." Pastor Wang Zhongzi of the North China Christian Association vowed not to take American money in 1951. Yesterday, he ran around everywhere while ill to mobilize various denominations to participate in the parade. Today, he mobilized eight denominations to participate. In the church procession, there was an old man from the Methodist Episcopal Church, Mr. Luo Xianzhang. He was already seventy-one years old, with a full beard of silver, leaning on a cane, and also ran along with the young people with vigor. He said: "I joined the church when I was a teenager and was deceived in the past, but now with the People's Republic of China, we are no longer weak. We all have jobs and no longer need American 'aid'."
    "Dollars cannot buy the conscience of the Chinese people!" American aggressors like Austin should realize that today any Chinese people are inviolable.

    “美元收买不了中国人民的心！”
    本报记者  贺笠
    北京市劳动人民文化宫，今天成了北京教会学校、教会团体及留美学生反对美帝文化侵略的大会场。他们都怀着满腔激愤，挤满了大院，挤满了四壁厢的走廊。满院子树立起森林似的手臂，成千成万人的声音在高呼：“抗议奥斯汀侮辱中国人民！”“反诽谤！反欺骗！反侮辱！”“粉碎美帝文化侵略！”
    奥斯汀无耻地侮辱了中国的教会学校、教会团体和留美学生。他在安理会上说，“中国全部大学毕业生中有八分之一曾在美国基督教新教传教会建立的十三所大学中的一个大学或一个以上的大学中受过教育”。“有一万人在美国受过大学教育。”另外还有：“据估计，有二十五万以上的中国学生曾在美国在华所资助的小学和中学毕业。”奥斯汀吹嘘这是美帝国主义对中国人的“友谊”。究竟这算是一些什么“友谊”呢？请听今天到会的人们的控诉吧：
    潘光旦教授愤慨地说：“我们许多人过去都患过想美病，崇拜过美国的‘物质文明’和‘美国生活方式’，精神生活与物质生活都受了美帝的麻醉。”他幽默地说，“奥斯汀这个医生，使我们清醒过来了。现在我们知道了美帝的文化侵略是一本万利的生意。”
    育英高中二班同学王玮气愤地说：“美帝所办的教会学校硬要同学念英文，硬要同学做祷告，并且造成一种‘美国优于一切’的空气，使同学们几乎忘了自己是中国人。”
    教育部留学生招待所和革大政治研究院的百余留美学生，都是今年返国来的，他们回国时都曾遭到美帝的威逼、利诱和各种方式的拦阻。他们都愤恨美帝国主义给予他们的“友谊”。清华大学教授冯友兰、吴景超、雷海宗、李继侗等都是三十年前的留美学生。他们都揭露了美帝培养中国留学生的目的，是要从政治上造就亲美派，从经济上扩大市场，从文化思想上俘虏中国人民的灵魂。协和医学院教务长张鋆简短有力地说了一句：“今天我们的举动是使美帝知道他的金钱不能买到一切！”
    美国帝国主义的卑鄙的“友谊”引起了这个伟大人群的仇视与鄙视。
    游行的行列出发了。燕京大学的同学们高举着大幅标语：“美元收买不了中国人民的良心！”高喊着“打倒美国帝国主义”的口号。清华大学是由美国帝国主义用枪炮掠取的“庚子赔款”办起来的。这也是奥斯汀所宣传的“友谊”。今天，清华的同学们却高扛着“呸！奥斯汀，闭住你的嘴！”的漫画。辅仁大学的行列里抬着一个美国纸老虎。
    许多宗教团体都打着“坚决自立自传自养”的旗帜，华北基督教联合会牧师王仲梓发誓在一九五一年不要美国的钱了。昨天为了动员各公会参加游行，他带着病到处奔跑。今天有八个公会都是他动员来参加的。在教会的行列里，有一位美以美教会的老人罗宪章先生。他已是七十一岁了，满颔银须，扶着拐杖，也抖擞精神地跟着青年一块儿跑着。他说：“我十几岁就入教，过去被人欺骗了，但是现在有了中华人民共和国就再不是弱者了。我们都有了工作，再也不要美帝‘资助’了。”
    “美元收买不了中国人民的良心！”美国侵略者如奥斯汀之流应该认识今天任何一个中国人民都是不可侮的了。
