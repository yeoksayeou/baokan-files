Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 10th: Trade organizations in various parts of the Southwest region are paying attention to solving the salt shortage difficulties in ethnic minority areas.

Under the rule of successive reactionary governments, ethnic minorities were mostly driven to live in mountainous areas with poor transportation and extreme transportation difficulties. As a result, salt sources were difficult to obtain and prices were high. In some areas of eastern and western Guizhou, seventeen catties of rice were exchanged for one catty of salt, causing many ethnic minority people to suffer from a bland diet all year round. The Kuomintang reactionaries repeatedly used the transportation of salt as a pretext to deceive and extort the masses, and many people often paid money but still could not get salt.

After the liberation of the Southwest region, the people's government correctly implemented trade policies, opened up salt sources, and adjusted salt prices in a planned way, eliminating unreasonable transportation and miscellaneous fees. The average salt price in October this year was 21 to 58 percent lower than in May. Currently, the price of salt in Guizhou Province has fallen from 12,000 yuan per catty to 5,000 yuan. The salt transportation cost from salt fields such as Zigong and Jianle in southern Sichuan to Guizhou, Xikang, and other places has also been reduced by 35 to 58 percent. The supply of salt to ethnic minority areas such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Leibo and Mabian in southern Sichuan is also increasing day by day. In September, the sales volume of salt in Guizhou Province increased by more than double compared to May. The phenomenon of salt supply falling short of demand has begun to change in various places.

In order to prevent speculative merchants from raising salt prices and seeking exorbitant profits, trade companies in various places have set up salt sales stores in ethnic minority areas and given preferential treatment to ethnic minority salt merchants through discounts and tax-owed prices. In the contract signed with ethnic minority salt merchants, the Yunnan Salt Branch sells 500 dan of salt per month to Yuanjiang, Jianshui, Shiping, and other counties. Some areas of Guizhou have also established salt sales groups that go deep into the countryside to sell salt, in order to reduce the suffering of people of all ethnic groups who have to travel long distances to buy salt. In Longli County alone, seven salt sales groups sold more than 3,000 catties of salt in five days.

    西南解决少数民族地区盐荒
    打通盐源合理调整盐价 
    并以折扣和记欠税价等办法优待少数民族盐商
    【新华社重庆十日电】西南区各地贸易机关注意解决少数民族地区的盐荒困难。
    在历代反动政府统治下，少数民族多被赶至交通闭塞、运输极端困难的山区居住，因而食盐来源不易，价格高昂，黔东、黔西部分地区曾以十七斤米换一斤食盐，致使许多少数民族的人民，常年忍受着淡食的痛苦。国民党反动派并多次以运输食盐为名，欺骗、勒索群众，许多人往往付钱后，仍得不到盐吃。
    西南地区解放后，人民政府正确执行贸易政策，打通盐源，有计划地调整盐价，取消不合理的运杂费。今年十月份的盐价平均比五月份降低百分之二十一到五十八。现贵州省的盐价，每斤已由一万二千元回落到五千元。从川南自贡、犍乐等盐场，运往贵州、西康等地的盐运成本，也减低了百分之三十五到五十八。云南、贵州、西康及川南区雷波、马边等少数民族地区食盐的供应量亦逐日增加。九月份贵州全省销盐量比五月份增加了一倍以上。各地开始已改变过去食盐供不应求的现象。
    各地贸易公司为杜绝投机商人抬高盐价、谋取暴利，特在少数民族地区设立盐销店，并以折扣和记欠税价等办法，优待少数民族盐商。云南盐业分公司在和少数民族盐商订立的合同中，每月以五百担盐行销元江、建水、石屏等县。贵州部分地区还成立了销盐组，深入农村售盐，以减少各民族人民为购买食盐而长途跋涉的痛苦。仅龙里县七个销盐组于五天内，即销盐三千余斤。
