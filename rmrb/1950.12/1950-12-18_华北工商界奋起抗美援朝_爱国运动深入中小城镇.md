Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Country movement within industrial and commercial circles is unfolding extensively in small and medium cities throughout North China. Industrial and commercial circles in cities such as Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Tongxian, Handan, Gui Sui, and Baotou have successively held current affairs symposiums, formulated patriotic covenants, and held Resist America and patriotic demonstrations in recent days.

The industrial and commercial circles of Tangshan and Baoding in Hebei Province held solemn patriotic demonstrations on the 12th and 13th respectively. The procession of more than 4,000 people from 69 industries in Baoding was personally reviewed by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. The entire industrial and commercial community jointly wrote a letter to express their respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

Industrialists and businessmen in Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Handan, and other cities have also held meetings to discuss current affairs and formulate patriotic covenants. They unanimously pledged to increase production, refrain from speculation and profiteering, and learn from the patriotic actions of industrial and commercial circles in Beijing and Tianjin.

The industrial and commercial circles of Zhangjiakou City, Chahar Province, established the "Zhangjiakou City Industrial and Commercial Circles Oppose American Imperialist Aggression and Defend World Peace Committee" as early as November and formulated a patriotic covenant. After hearing news of the patriotic parades in Beijing and Tianjin, the industrial and commercial circles of Zhangjiakou became even more excited. Representatives from 132 industries throughout the city held a current affairs symposium in November, unanimously expressing their determination to respond resolutely to Chairman Mao's call to "form a unified front that is even more consolidated than in the past with the masses of the people to oppose imperialist aggression," actively manage production, abide by government laws and regulations, stabilize prices, and enthusiastically launch a movement to express sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

The industrial and commercial circles of Gui Sui City, Suiyuan Province, have universally launched current affairs studies and unanimously stated that they will participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement with practical actions. The leather tanning and grain industries have paid business taxes on time. The city's Industrial and Commercial Circles Resist America, Aid Korea Mobilization Committee is rushing to make brocade banners and collect condolence bags. Industrial and commercial circles in Baotou City also held a symposium, where everyone present expressed their desire to be a patriotic merchant and resist America, aid Korea, protect the home and defend the country with practical actions.

This patriotic action by the industrial and commercial circles of North China is continuing to penetrate into various small towns.

    爱国运动深入中小城镇
    【新华社十六日讯】工商界抗美援朝保家卫国运动，在华北各中小城市中广泛展开。张家口、保定、唐山、石家庄、秦皇岛、通县、邯郸、归绥、包头等城市的工商界，连日纷纷举行时事座谈会，制订爱国公约，和举行抗美爱国的示威游行。
    河北省唐山和保定两市工商界，先后于十二、十三两日举行了庄严的爱国示威游行。保定市工商界六十九个行业四千余人的游行队伍，由省人民政府杨秀峰主席亲自检阅，全市工商界并联名写信给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬。
    石家庄、秦皇岛、邯郸等城市工商业者也都先后举行会议，讨论时事，制订爱国公约，他们一致保证要增加生产，不投机倒把，学习京、津等地工商界的爱国行动。
    察哈尔省张家口市工商界，早在十一月间就已成立“张市工商界反对美帝侵略保卫世界和平委员会”，并订立了爱国公约。京、津等地工商界爱国游行的消息传来后，张市工商界更形兴奋。全市一百三十二个行业代表于十一月举行了时事座谈会，大家一致表示坚决响应毛主席的“和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线”的号召，积极经营生产，遵守政府法令，稳定物价，并要热烈展开慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的运动。
    绥远省归绥市工商界已普遍展开时事学习，并一致表示要以实际行动参加抗美援朝爱国运动。熟皮、粮食两行业已按时缴纳营业税。该市工商界抗美援朝动员委员会正在赶制锦旗和筹集慰问袋。包头市工商界亦召开了座谈会，到会的每个人都表示要当一个爱国的商人，以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国。
    华北工商界的这一爱国行动，正继续向各小城镇深入开展中。
