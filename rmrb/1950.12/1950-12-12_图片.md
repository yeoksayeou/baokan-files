    In China, the broad masses of the people have launched a great and just movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, along with enthusiastic celebrations and expressions of sympathy and solicitude.

    On the Korean front, the Chinese and Korean people's fighters crushed MacArthur's "general offensive" and bravely pursued and annihilated the enemy.

    In the United States, soldiers are forced to go to war, and the people oppose the war of aggression against Korea.
