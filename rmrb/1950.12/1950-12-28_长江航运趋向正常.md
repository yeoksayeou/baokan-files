Xinhua News Agency:

    Yangtze River shipping has returned to normal after a year of recovery and rectification. In the first half of this year, the total freight volume increased by 46% compared to the second half of last year. Since June, the freight volume has continued to increase, with August increasing by more than 34,000 tons compared to July, and September increasing by more than 83,000 tons compared to August. The largest quantities of goods transported were grain, oil, salt, coal, and cotton yarn; this has played a significant role in regulating the supply of goods between the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and stabilizing prices in those areas.
    The recovery of Yangtze River shipping was extremely difficult. On the eve of the liberation of Wuhan and Chongqing, ships on the main and tributary lines of the Yangtze River, as well as navigational aids in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze, were subjected to frantic sabotage by the Kuomintang bandit gangs. In Wuhan alone, 66 ships of various types were sunk. All 58 navigational aids in the Hankou-to-Yichang section were destroyed. After the liberation of the entire Yangtze River, the People's Government vigorously carried out the work of salvaging sunken ships and repairing navigational aids. Last winter and this spring, the Shanghai and Wuhan Salvage Committees salvaged and rescued a total of 105 ships of various types, totaling 32,837 tons. The People's Government also allocated large amounts of loans to help private shipping companies resume operations. In the early days of Chongqing's liberation, the local private shipping industry received loans of 9.33 billion yuan from the People's Bank. This year, the People's Government, in accordance with the policy of considering both public and private interests, and prioritizing low interest rates and high volume of transport, rationally adjusted the relationship between public and private shipping and the prices of passenger and freight transport, enabling both public and private shipping to overcome the temporary difficulties faced by industry and commerce in the first half of this year. In July of this year, in order to secure cargo sources and ensure legitimate profits for the shipping industry, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, based on the principle of low profit and high volume, changed the cargo classification from four to ten classes, reducing upstream freight rates by 14.7% and downstream freight rates by 36%. As a result, freight volume increased significantly. In order to ensure navigational safety and reduce and eliminate navigational accidents, the Administration is currently conducting examinations and training for crew members, strengthening inspection systems, and establishing reward and punishment systems.

    长江航运趋向正常
    【新华社讯】长江航运经一年来的恢复和整顿已转入正常。今年上半年全线货运量较去年下半年增加了百分之四十六。六月份以后，货运量仍不断递增，八月份较七月份增加三万四千余吨，九月又较八月份增加八万三千余吨。货运中以粮食、油、盐、煤和花纱布等数量最大；对调剂长江上下游的物资和稳定各该地的物价起了很大作用。
    长江航运的恢复曾经是极为困难的。武汉、重庆解放前夕，长江干线、支线的船只和长江中上游的航标设备曾受到国民党匪帮的疯狂破坏。仅武汉一地，就被炸沉各种船只六十六艘。汉口至宜昌段的五十八处航标设备全部被毁。长江全线解放后，人民政府即大力进行打捞沉船和修复航标设备的工作。去冬今春，经上海、武汉两地打捞委员会打捞和施救的各项船只共有一百零五艘，总计三万二千八百三十七吨。人民政府并拨出大量贷款帮助私营轮船公司复航。重庆解放初期，该地私营轮船业就得到人民银行九十三亿三千万元的贷款。今年人民政府有计划的根据公私兼顾、低利多运的政策，合理地调整了公私营航业的关系和客货运价格，使公私营航业得以度过今年上半年工商业暂时困难的时期。今年七月，长江航务管理局为争取货源和保证航业正当利润，又根据低利多运的原则，将货物分等由四等改为十等，将上水运价减低百分之十四点七，下水运价减低百分之三十六。因而货运量显著提高。为保证航行安全、减少和消灭航行事故，该局现正进行考试和训练船员、加强检查制度和规定奖惩制度等工作。
