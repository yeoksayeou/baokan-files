    "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Crew
     Proposes Six Guarantees to Support the Korean Front

    To the Editorial Comrades:
    When our locomotive crew comrades read in the newspaper that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in their heroic southward counter-offensive, had liberated Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we were particularly happy. However, we must not be complacent or be carried away by victory; we must continue to work hard in production to support the soldiers at the Korean front. Our locomotive crew will take transport safety and prevention of enemy sabotage as our practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. Our locomotive crew hereby declares to the people of the whole country and puts forward six guarantees: (1) In order to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country, we will obey the orders of our superiors; (2) We will supply the needs of the Korean front by hauling more, running faster, running on time, and avoiding any accidents for a long time; (3) Under any circumstances, we will stick to our posts and never retreat; (4) We will thoroughly save coal, save oil, and save materials to consolidate the economic foundation for resisting America and aiding Korea; (5) We will expose enemy rumors at any time and any place, and report saboteurs; (6) We will resolutely and strictly guard military and all related secrets. With the above guarantees, we will act as the rearguard on the production front for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, so that the Chinese and Korean soldiers can make another effort to drive the American imperialists out of Korea and lay a solid foundation for lasting world peace.

    “毛泽东号”机车组
     提出六项保证支援朝鲜前线编辑同志：
    我们机车组的同志们，在报纸上看到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在英勇的南进反攻下，解放了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的临时首都平壤，心中特别高兴。但我们决不能麻痹，决不能被胜利冲昏了头脑，一定要继续努力搞好生产，支援朝鲜前方的战士们。我们机车组要拿运输安全、防止敌特破坏，来做我们抗美援朝的实际行动。我们机车组并向全国人民宣誓，提出六项保证：（一）为了抗美援朝保家卫国，服从上级调动；（二）以多拉、快跑、正点运行、长期不出任何事故，来供应朝鲜前方的需要；（三）在任何情况下，坚守工作岗位，决不退缩；（四）彻底做到节煤、节油、节省材料，以巩固抗美援朝的经济基础；（五）随时随地揭穿敌特谣言，并检举破坏分子；（六）坚决严守军事及一切有关秘密。我们拿以上的保证，在生产战线上，做朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的后盾，使中朝人民战士再努一把力，把美帝赶出朝鲜去，为世界持久和平奠定巩固基础。
