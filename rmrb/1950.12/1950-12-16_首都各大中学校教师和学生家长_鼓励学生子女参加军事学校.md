    [Our Newspaper] Teachers and parents of students from major universities and middle schools in the capital are encouraging their children to join military academies.
    Amidst the surge of students from major universities and middle schools in the capital joining various military cadre schools, they have received encouragement from teachers and their parents. Many school teachers are encouraging young students to participate in national defense construction. Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University School Affairs Committee, said: Some time ago, many colleagues and students enthusiastically signed up to join the Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Now that military cadre schools are recruiting, this is indeed a good opportunity for students who are eager to join the army. We educators should encourage students to go. Professor Xu Deheng of the same university said: Chinese youth should inherit the glorious tradition of the "December 9th" Movement and enthusiastically participate in military cadre schools. Professor Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University said: I wholeheartedly support the government's decision. This work requires a group of people who have mastered specialized technologies and have a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge. He also expressed his willingness to help students solve mathematical problems they may encounter while studying in military schools. Jiang Yin'en, Director of the Journalism Department of Yenching University, wrote an article entitled "Students, Go to Your Most Glorious Post," encouraging students to happily embark on their glorious posts. Professors from the Geology and Mining Departments of Tsinghua University, and Professor Li Jinxi from the Chinese Department of Normal University, wrote letters to their respective departments' students, encouraging them to actively participate in national defense construction.
    Many students' parents are encouraging their children to join military academies. Professor Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin of Tsinghua University very much agree with their son Liang Congjie joining a military cadre school. They also encouraged students from the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University to persuade their parents. Liang Sicheng said: "In feudal families, parents overly spoil their children, and the children rarely achieve anything. For the sake of the motherland and the children, we should let them be tempered in the work of the motherland." Xu Jinzhu, a student at Municipal Fourth Middle School, and his two brothers all signed up to join military cadre schools. His mother, Zhao Yi, wrote to them saying: "I am honored because your three brothers are joining military cadre schools together. This is the heroic spirit of the good sons of New China." Zhang Youmei, an engineer at the Nankou Locomotive Factory and father of Zhang Huanran, a student at Municipal Eighth Middle School, also encouraged his three children to join military cadre schools. Du Gang, a student at Fu Jen High School, Xue Baohua, a worker at the People's Printing Factory, Xu Fangli, a student at Hebei Provincial Normal School, Shao Wu, a student at National Senior Industrial School, Wang Tongzun, a student at Municipal Second Middle School, Zhang Yuling, a student at Mu Zhen Women's High School, and Qian Xuemin, a student at the Normal University Women's Affiliated High School, all received their parents' consent and encouragement and are determined to sign up.
