Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 12th: Even in Fuzhou, a city not particularly known for its industrial development, the vitality of national industry that has emerged in the year since the expulsion of American imperialist forces is remarkably significant. Before liberation, American and Canadian newsprint dominated the market for all newspapers, magazines, and textbook paper in Fujian Province. The batteries used in Fuzhou and neighboring counties were also American-made "Baojiu" brand. This situation forced the privately-owned Fuzhou Paper Mill and the only Huamei Battery Factory to cease operations. The potassium chlorate factory attached to the Jianhua Match Factory, which supplied the entire province during the War of Resistance Against Japan, also collapsed before liberation due to its inability to withstand the dumping of American goods. Before liberation, American glass combs, glass toothbrushes, and glass belts brought disaster to Fuzhou's handicrafts industry. At that time, most of the city's 110 horn comb workshops and 15 leather workshops were forced to close; two-thirds of the 30 toothbrush workshops also suspended operations. This disaster ended with the liberation of Fuzhou. The Fuzhou Paper Mill received government orders and loan assistance, and its current output meets the needs of the province, with monthly production increasing by 40 percent compared to before the suspension of operations before liberation. The Huamei Battery Factory has also been restored, and its battery production cannot meet the demand; most of the horn comb, toothbrush, and leather workshops have also resumed operations.

    美帝国主义势力被驱逐后            
    福州民族工业获生机
    【新华社福州十二日电】即使在福州市这样一个工业并不发达的城市里，一年来由于美帝国主义势力被逐出而出现的民族工业的生机也是极显著的。解放前，美国、加拿大白报纸占据了福建全省所有报章杂志及教科书用纸的市场；福州市和邻近各县所用的电池也是美国制的“保久”牌。这种情况迫使私营福建造纸厂和仅有的华美电池厂只好停工。建华火柴厂附属的氯酸钾工厂，抗战时产品供应全省，解放前也因经不起美货倾销而倒闭了。解放前，美国的玻璃梳子、玻璃牙刷、玻璃皮带更给福州市的手工业带来灾难。当时全市一百一十家角梳作坊和十五家皮革作坊的大部被迫歇业了；三十家牙刷作坊也有三分之二半停业。这种灾难随着福州市的解放而结束。福建造纸厂得到政府定货和贷款的扶助，目前产品供应本省需要，月产量较解放前停工前增加了百分之四十。华美电池厂亦已恢复，所产电池供不应求；绝大部分的角梳、牙刷、皮革作坊也已复业。
