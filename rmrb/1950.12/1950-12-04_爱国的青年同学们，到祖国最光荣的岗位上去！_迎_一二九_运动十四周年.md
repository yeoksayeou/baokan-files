Patriotic Young Students, Go to the Most Glorious Posts of the Motherland!
Welcoming the 14th Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
Xiao Hua

As we commemorate the upcoming 14th anniversary of the glorious struggle festival of Chinese youth students, the "December 9th" Movement, we would like to pay our respects to the heroic Chinese intellectuals with revolutionary traditions! We salute the young people who bravely joined the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!

Chairman Mao told us as early as the preparatory meeting of the People's Political Consultative Conference in June 1949: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China. They will still collude with each other to oppose the Chinese people by all possible means... If they still want to take risks, it is not impossible to send part of their forces to harass China's borders." He repeatedly reminded us: "They will attempt to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and there is no doubt about it. We must not relax our vigilance." Sure enough, in the eighth month after the founding of the People's Republic of China, US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time ordered its Seventh Fleet to invade our Taiwan. US planes continuously invaded our airspace, massacred our peaceful residents, and US naval vessels invaded our territorial waters, shelling our merchant ships. Disregarding our people's repeated warnings, they brazenly crossed the 38th parallel and burned the flames of war to our borders, directly and seriously threatening the security of our motherland. This series of facts nakedly exposed the US imperialists' attempt to use Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam as springboards to attack our country and then invade our country on a large scale. They attempted to plunge the new China of democracy and freedom back into the dark era of the past. However, their calculations were wrong. The brave and great Chinese people and the heroic and good-at-fighting Chinese People's Liberation Army have the strength to defend the fruits of their victory and defend their motherland, and to shatter all their aggressive plots.

Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese students have always stood at the forefront and played a vanguard role in every patriotic struggle against imperialism and reactionaries. The "December 9th" Movement is the most vivid and glorious page in these many admirable deeds. During the twenty-three years of revolutionary war, patriotic intellectuals, for the sake of national and social liberation, similarly participated in the great people's armed struggle in tens of thousands; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they poured into the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an and various cadre schools of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army like a torrent; during the War of Liberation, a large number of patriotic intellectuals participated in the military and political universities and work groups and cultural work groups of the troops in various places, and almost all the participating students were trained into excellent military and political work cadres of the People's Liberation Army today, and many became famous combat heroes and work models. Today, when the bloodstained hands of the invaders are seriously threatening the security of the motherland, the people of the whole country have once again launched a new patriotic upsurge, with infinite anger at US imperialism, and tens of thousands of young people are waiting for the call of the motherland, signing up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. These are all the glory of our Chinese nation, and also the supreme glory of Chinese youth.

In order to accomplish this sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, we need to further develop and strengthen our national defense forces. We must not only have a brave and good-at-fighting army, but also have a strong air force and a strong navy in order to defend the motherland's airspace and territorial waters, and to protect the sacred territory from US imperialist invasion. The task of this national defense construction is very huge, and it requires the support and active participation of the people of the whole country, especially the patriotic youth. Now our Central People's Government has opened aviation schools, naval schools, armored schools, artillery schools, and air defense schools for the construction of these new types of armed forces. The equipment of the National Defense Forces is also constantly improving. We warmly welcome patriotic students to participate in these schools to learn and master new modern technologies, and to cultivate various specialized talents and cadres for the national defense construction of the motherland, so that in the near future, our motherland will have countless divine eagles flying in the free skies of the motherland, and a mighty people's navy sailing in the vast territorial waters. In addition, modernized mechanized troops, and a heroic and invincible strong infantry, guard the territory of the motherland. If US imperialism dares to invade even an inch of our land, we will give it a crushing blow!

Friends! The era when the Chinese people were bullied by imperialism has passed. The dark era when Chinese students were slaughtered and oppressed by imperialists and traitors with their bare hands will never return. Today, we are the masters of a free motherland, and the army is our own armed force. Let us continue to give full play to the vanguard role of Chinese youth, enthusiastically participate in the great cause of national defense construction, and forever stand on the most glorious fighting posts of the motherland!

    爱国的青年同学们，到祖国最光荣的岗位上去！
    迎“一二九”运动十四周年
    萧华
    当我们纪念中国青年学生光荣的斗争节日“一二九”运动十四周年即将到来的时候，我们谨向富有革命传统的英勇的中国知识青年们致敬！向英勇参加抗美援朝志愿部队的青年们致敬！
    毛主席在一九四九年六月人民政治协商会议筹备会上早就告诉我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的，他们还会要互相勾结在一起用各种可能的方法反对中国人民………假如他们还想冒险的话，派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境，也不是不可能的”，他还再三提醒我们：“他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟，这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”。果然，在中华人民共和国成立以后的第八个月，美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，同时命令其第七舰队侵略我国台湾，美机连续侵入我国领空，屠杀我国和平居民，美帝海军侵入我国领海，炮击我国商船，并不顾我国人民历次警告，悍然越过三八线，把战争火焰燃烧到我国边境，直接严重地威胁我们祖国的安全。这一连串的事实，赤裸裸地暴露出美帝国主义企图把朝鲜、台湾以及越南作为进攻我国的跳板，进而大举侵略我国，他们企图使民主自由的新中国再陷入过去黑暗的时代。但是，他们的算盘是打错了，勇敢伟大的中国人民和英勇善战的中国人民解放军，是有力量来保卫自己胜利的果实，保卫祖国；粉碎他的一切侵略阴谋的。
    中国学生从五四以来在每次反对帝国主义和反动派的爱国斗争中历来是站在最前列，起着先锋的作用。“一二九”运动就是这许多可歌可泣事迹中最生动的光辉一页。在二十三年的革命战争中，爱国的知识青年为了民族与社会解放，同样的成千成万地参加了伟大的人民武装斗争；抗日战争中更像洪流一样投入延安抗日军政大学以及八路军新四军各种干部学校；在解放战争中，更有大量的爱国知识青年参加了各地军政大学和部队的工作团、文工团，并且几乎所有参加的同学都锻炼成了今天人民解放军的优秀的军事政治工作干部，不少成了著名的战斗英雄与工作模范。今天，当侵略者的血手严重地威胁祖国安全的时候，全国人民又掀起了新的爱国主义高潮，对美帝怀着无限的愤怒，成千累万的青年正期待着祖国的号召，报名参加抗美援朝志愿军。这些都是我们中华民族的光荣，也是中国青年的无上光荣。
    为要完成抗美援朝保家卫国的这个神圣任务，就需要我们进一步发展与加强我们的国防力量，我们不仅要有一支英勇善战的陆军，而且要有一支强大的空军和一支强大的海军，才足以保卫祖国的领空、领海，保卫神圣的国土不受美帝的侵犯。这个国防建设的任务是非常巨大，须要我们全国人民首先是爱国青年们的支持与积极参加的。现在我们的中央人民政府已经为这些新式兵种的建设开办了航空学校、海军学校、装甲学校、炮兵学校、防空学校，国防军的装备也正在不断改善，我们热诚地欢迎爱国同学们，参加到这些学校中来学习，以掌握新式的现代化的技术，为祖国的国防建设培养出各种专门的人材与干部，使我们的祖国在不远的将来，便会有无数的神鹰飞翔在祖国自由的天空，雄威的人民海军，行驶在广阔的领海，再加上现代化的机械化部队，与英雄无敌的强大步兵，警卫着祖国的领土，美帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们一寸土地，我们就要给以粉碎地痛击！
    朋友们！中国人民受帝国主义欺侮的时代已经过去了，中国学生赤手空拳受帝国主义和卖国贼屠杀压迫的黑暗时代也一去不复返了。今天，我们是自由祖国的主人，军队是属于我们自己的武装，让我们继续发挥中国青年的先锋作用，热烈地参加到伟大的国防建设事业中来，永远站在祖国最光荣的斗争岗位上！
