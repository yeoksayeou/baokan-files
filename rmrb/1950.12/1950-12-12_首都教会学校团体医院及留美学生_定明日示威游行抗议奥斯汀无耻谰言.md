    Capital Christian Schools, Organizations, Hospitals and Students Returned from the US
    To Hold Demonstration Tomorrow to Protest Austin's Shameless Lies
    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (11th), heads of capital Christian schools, Christian organizations, Christian hospitals and related schools held a symposium and decided to hold a demonstration parade tomorrow (13th) to protest the shameless lies Austin made in the Security Council and expose the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out cultural aggression. Participants in the parade will include faculty, staff and students from major Christian universities and middle schools in the capital, as well as from Tsinghua and Fu Jen Universities, staff from church hospitals and church organizations, and students returned from the US in Beijing.
    Those attending the symposium included more than 50 units such as Yenching University, Fu Jen University, Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, Yu Ying Middle School, Bridgman Academy, Huiwen Middle School, North China Christian Association, Methodist Church, and Daoji Hospital. Lu Zhiwei, Chairman of the School Board of Yenching University, Zhao Zichen, Dean of the Theological Seminary, Jiang Changchuan, Superintendent of the Methodist Church, Wang Zizhong, General Secretary of the North China Christian Association, Gao Fengshan, Principal of Huiwen Middle School, Li Zongen, President of Peking Union Medical College, Chai Degeng, Chairman of the Trade Union of Fu Jen University, Wu Jingchao, Professor of Tsinghua University, and Yan Jingyao, Professor of Yenching University, spoke one after another, denouncing the shameless lies made by Wall Street pawn Austin at the Security Council on November 28, which was an insult to the Chinese people, especially to Chinese Christian organizations, schools and hospitals. Mr. Lu Zhiwei said: "Now the Chinese nation is a victorious nation and will never tolerate any insult from imperialists. We must respond to Austin's lies with action!" Mr. Zhao Zichen said: "Chinese Christians are loyal to Christ, and loyal to the motherland and the people. More than 20,000 Christians across the country have signed their names on patriotic declarations, and Christians in various places are responding to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. We cannot tolerate American imperialism using Christ for aggression, and Jesus Christ cannot tolerate this evil behavior of American imperialism. Therefore, Chinese Christians must stand on the position of Christ to oppose American imperialism!" Mr. Jiang Changchuan and Mr. Wang Zizhong both expressed that they must not be used by American imperialism and must rise up to fight back against it! Mr. Chai Degeng sarcastically ridiculed that Austin did not say and dared not say that the teachers and students of Fu Jen University, run by the most important Catholic Church, had already driven out the American imperialist forces. Professors Wu Jingchao of Tsinghua University and Yan Jingyao of Yenching University both exposed Austin's aggressive face as students returned from the United States, and expressed that students returned from the United States must participate in the demonstration.
    [Our Newspaper] The Yenching University Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression decided today to conduct propaganda in church middle schools, hospitals and other church organizations throughout the city to mobilize them to participate in tomorrow's demonstration. And put forward three loud slogans: (1) Dollars cannot buy our souls; (2) Crush the conspiracy of American imperialist cultural aggression; (3) Oppose American imperialist aggression and protest Austin's shameless speech.
    To this end, Professors Yan Jingyao, Lei Jieqiong, and Liu Chengzhao of the school also issued written opinions, hoping that schools, hospitals and other organizations related to the church will actively participate in this parade.

    首都教会学校团体医院及留美学生
    定明日示威游行抗议奥斯汀无耻谰言
    【本报讯】首都教会学校、教会团体、教会医院及有关学校负责人昨（十一）日举行座谈会，决议于明（十三）日举行示威大游行，抗议奥斯汀在安理会所发表的无耻谰言，揭露美帝进行文化侵略罪行。参加游行者将有首都各教会大、中学校以及清华、辅仁两大学的师生员工，教会医院、教会团体工作人员及在京留美学生。
    出席座谈会者有燕京大学、辅仁大学、协和医学院、清华大学、育英中学、贝满女中、汇文中学、华北基督教联合会、卫理公会、道济医院等五十多单位。燕京大学校委会主任陆志韦、宗教学院院长赵紫宸、卫理公会会督江长川、华北基督教联合会总干事王梓仲、汇文中学校长高凤山、协和医学院院长李宗恩、辅仁大学工会主席柴德赓、清华大学教授吴景超、燕京大学教授严景耀先后发言，纷纷痛斥十一月二十八日华尔街走卒奥斯汀在安理会上所发的无耻谰言，是对中国人民尤其是对中国教会团体、学校、医院的侮辱。陆志韦先生说：“现在中华民族是胜利的民族，决不能容忍帝国主义者任何侮辱。我们要用行动来回答奥斯汀的谰言！”赵紫宸先生说：“中国基督教徒忠于基督，忠于祖国、人民。全国已有两万多基督教徒在爱国宣言上签了名，各地基督教徒正在纷纷响应自治、自养、自传运动。我们不能容忍美帝利用基督来进行侵略，耶稣基督也不能容忍美帝这种罪恶行为。因此，中国基督教徒要站在基督的立场上来反对美帝国主义！”江长川先生和王梓仲先生都表示决不能受美帝利用而要奋起反击它！柴德赓先生辛辣地嘲笑奥斯汀没有说也不敢说出最重要的天主教会所办的辅仁大学师生已经把美帝侵略势力轰了出去。清华大学教授吴景超、燕京大学教授严景耀都以留美学生的身份揭发奥斯汀的侵略嘴脸，并表示留美学生一定要参加示威行列。
    【本报讯】燕京大学保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会决定今日到全市教会中学、医院等教会团体进行宣传，动员他们参加明日的示威游行行列。并提出了三个响亮的口号：（一）美元收买不了我们的灵魂；（二）粉碎美帝文化侵略的阴谋；（三）反对美帝侵略，抗议奥斯汀无耻的演说。
    为此，该校严景耀、雷洁琼、刘承钊三教授并发表书面意见，希望与教会有关的学校、医院等团体，踊跃参加这一游行。
