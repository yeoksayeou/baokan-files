    The 42,989 patriotic industrialists and businessmen of Tianjin held a righteous demonstration on November 30th. This glorious action shows that industrialists and businessmen in China's second industrial and commercial city have a general understanding of the reactionary war of aggression against China and Korea by the American imperialists. Undeterred by deception or intimidation, they firmly stood on the patriotic position of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and the country, and staged a magnificent demonstration against the American imperialists. This is an important symbol of a new patriotic upsurge among the Chinese people. Chairman Mao sent a telegram on December 2nd in reply to the Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Anti-American and Aid Korea, Defend Home and Defend the Country Demonstration Rally, expressing his welcome to this righteous demonstration, and hoping that all patriotic industrialists and businessmen and the masses of people in China will unite to form a united front against imperialist aggression that is even more consolidated than in the past. At the current stage when the safety of the motherland is facing serious threats and the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea, this document is of particular historical importance.

    Chairman Mao said in his reply telegram: "American imperialists have done a lot of deceptive propaganda to the Chinese people, and all patriots should not believe these deceptive remarks." History tells us that the American imperialist aggression against our country began in 1832 when the American warship Peacock first invaded our Guangdong territorial waters. It has consistently helped British and Japanese imperialists to invade our country. It has consistently helped the Chinese traitor Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek, and other reactionary warlords to oppress our people. For the sake of aggression and oppression, American imperialists have spared no effort in carrying out deceptive propaganda in our country. American imperialists habitually use words like "open door," "democracy," and "freedom" to cover up their sinful essence. The facts are before our eyes. The "open door" it flaunts is economic aggression; the "democracy" it boasts of is vote-buying manipulated by Wall Street tycoons; and the "freedom" it boasts of is the lynching-style freedom of the Ku Klux Klan. After the Japanese surrender, American imperialists, on the one hand, armed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, massacred and plundered our people, and on the other hand, carried out hypocritical propaganda of "Sino-American friendship" and "Sino-American cooperation." Our people defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and liberated all the territory except Tibet and Taiwan. From the bloody struggle, they deeply realized the reality of the so-called "friendship" and "cooperation" of American imperialists. For example, the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," a secret service agency of the US-Chiang, even brutally massacred more than 300 revolutionary martyrs collectively on the eve of Chongqing's liberation. The terrible nature of the American imperialists' so-called "Sino-American cooperation" is like this. After the Japanese surrender, the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration, in the guise of "Sino-American friendship," unscrupulously put forward a plan for American businesses to invest in the construction of 953 factories of 121 types of industries in our country in the "Guide to China's Industrialization," in order to accelerate the colonialization of our country. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution shattered this huge conspiracy of economic aggression by American imperialism and enabled our industry and commerce to enter a prosperous and healthy path. Now, industrialists and businessmen in our country have deeply realized the taste of American imperialist economic aggression in the past from the changes in their actual lives. For example, Li Shuren of Tianjin Xinminsheng Cigarette Factory said at the Anti-American and Aid Korea, Defend Home and Defend the Country meeting of the cigarette industry in the city: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the market was flooded with American cigarettes. Most of the 15 cigarette factories in the city were shut down. The total output in the second half of 1948 was less than the output of one month now. Therefore, the cigarette industry must take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea to defend the country, and settle this account with American imperialism." Li Weiyi, Director of the Tianjin Leather Industry Association, said: "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of thousands of catties of American leather were dumped into Tianjin, and our 300 factories reduced production by 90%. The largest one only produced three to five pieces a day, and it was impossible to survive. After liberation, our production capacity has recovered, and now we can produce 10,000 pieces of leather per month. The leather industry is developing. We must not allow American imperialism to destroy it again." This kind of personal practical lesson is helpful to expose some deceptive remarks of American imperialists.

    Now, American imperialists are following the old path of Japanese fascists, invading Korea, invading China's Taiwan, and threatening the border of our Northeast with troops, attempting to conquer Korea first, then conquer China, and then rule Asia and dominate the world. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have shattered the aggressive arrogance of American imperialism with successive victories. However, the American imperialists are not reconciled to defeat and continue to use various rogue methods to intimidate our people. In his statement on November 30th, Truman, unwilling to accept the ironclad evidence of his own initiation of the aggressive action, shamelessly accused the righteous action of the Chinese People's Volunteers as "aggression." He used these cries of "stepping up mobilization," "increasing military expenditures," "expanding military production," and even "preparing for atomic warfare" in an attempt to scare our people and weaken our people's will to resist aggression. However, the essentially weak nature of American imperialism is becoming more and more obvious. The strength of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has proven to be invincible. Under such an international situation, our people undoubtedly have sufficient reason to accept Chairman Mao's great instruction: "All patriots should be determined to resist the aggression of American imperialism and not be intimidated by them."

    Following the Tianjin business community, the business communities of Beijing, Harbin, Qingdao, Xi'an and other places also held grand demonstrations. Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shenyang and other major cities have also set off a high tide of anti-American and aid Korea, defend home and defend the country movement. This shows that all patriotic industrialists and businessmen across the country are joining hands with the masses of the people to form a united front against imperialist aggression that is more consolidated than in the past. Our country, as explained in Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," is a new democratic country where several anti-imperialist classes unite to jointly exercise dictatorship. The stronger patriotic united front formed by industrialists and businessmen, workers, farmers, and intellectuals across the country precisely represents the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship in China, and therefore, as Chairman Mao said: "It foreshadows that the Chinese people must achieve final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression."

    最后胜利的预示
    天津市四万二千九百八十九位爱国的工商业者于十一月三十日举行了正义的示威游行。这个光辉的行动表明中国第二工商城市的工商业家们对于美帝国主义者侵略中国和朝鲜的反动战争已经有了普遍的认识。他们不受欺骗不怕恐吓，坚决地站在抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国立场上，对美帝国主义者作壮大的示威。这正是中国人民新的爱国高潮的一个重要标志。毛主席于十二月二日电复天津市工商业抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会，对这次正义的示威游行表示欢迎，并希望全中国一切爱国的工商业家和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线。在祖国的安全面临着严重的威胁，全国人民轰轰烈烈地展开了抗美援朝运动的目前阶段，这个文件特别显出了历史的重要性。
    毛主席的复电中说：“美国帝国主义者对于中国人民做了很多的欺骗宣传，一切爱国者都不应相信这些欺骗言论。”历史告诉我们，美国帝国主义对我国的侵略是从一八三二年美舰孔雀号首次侵入我广东领海就开始的。它一贯地帮助英日帝国主义侵略我国。它一贯地帮助中国窃国大盗袁世凯蒋介石及其他反动军阀压迫我国人民。为了侵略和压迫，美国帝国主义者在我国所进行的欺骗宣传是不遗余力的。美国帝国主义者惯用“门户开放”“民主”和“自由”等等字眼来掩饰自己的罪恶本质。事实摆在眼前，它所标榜的“门户开放”就是经济侵略，它所吹嘘的“民主”就是华尔街大亨们所操纵的贿选，它所吹嘘的“自由”就是三Ｋ党私刑式的自由。在日本投降以后，美国帝国主义者一面武装着蒋介石匪帮，残杀并掠夺我国人民，一面进行着“中美亲善”“中美合作”虚伪的宣传。我国人民打垮了蒋介石匪帮，解放了除西藏和台湾以外的全部领土，从血的斗争中，深切地体会到美帝国主义者所谓“亲善”和“合作”的实际。譬如，美蒋特务机关“中美合作所”甚至在重庆解放的前夕还残忍地集体屠杀了革命志士三百余人。美帝国主义者所谓“中美合作”的可怕性质就如此。美帝对外经济局在日本投降后，以“中美亲善”的姿态所发布的“中国工业化指南”中肆无忌惮地提出了美商在我国投资建设一百二十一种工业类型的九百五十三个工厂的计划，要使我国加紧殖民地化。我国人民革命的伟大胜利粉碎了美帝国主义的这一种经济侵略的巨大阴谋，使我国工商业进入了欣欣向荣的正轨。现在我国工商业家已经从实际生活的变化中间深切地体味到过去美国帝国主义经济侵略的滋味。例如天津新民生烟厂李树人在该市卷烟业抗美援朝保家卫国会上说：“国民党反动统治时期，市场上充斥了美国香烟。全市十五家烟厂多半陷于停顿。一九四八年下半年总产量不及现在一个月的产量。所以卷烟业要以抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动，和美帝国主义清算这一笔帐。”天津制革公会主任委员李威仪说：“抗日战争胜利后，几十万斤的美国皮革倾销到天津来，我们三百家工厂减产十分之九，最大的一家每天只产三、五张，已经无法生存了。解放以后，我们生产能力恢复了，现在已经可以月产一万张皮革。制革工业正在发展。我们不能让美帝国主义再来破坏。”这一类切身的实际教训，是有助于戳穿美帝国主义者的一些欺骗言论的。
    现在美国帝国主义者正走着日本法西斯的老路，侵略朝鲜、侵略我国的台湾，以大兵威胁我国东北的边境，妄图先征服朝鲜，再征服中国，而后统治亚洲，独霸世界。英勇的朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军已经以接连的胜利粉碎了美帝国主义的侵略凶焰。但是美国帝国主义者还不甘心于失败，继续用各种流氓手段恐吓我国人民。杜鲁门在十一月三十日的声明中，不愿自身发动侵略的罪恶行动的铁证如山，竟恬不知耻地控诉中国人民志愿军的正义行动是“侵略”。他用“加紧动员”“加拨军费”“扩大军事生产”甚而至于“准备原子战争”这些叫嚣，妄图吓住我国人民，削弱我国人民反对侵略的意志。但是，美国帝国主义外强中干的本质愈来愈明显了。以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量已经证明是无敌的。在这样的国际形势之下，我国人民无疑地有充分的理由接受毛主席的伟大指示：“一切爱国者都应有决心反抗美帝国主义的侵略，并不受他们的恐吓。”
    继天津工商界之后，北京、哈尔滨、青岛、西安等地工商界也举行了盛大的示威游行。上海、汉口、广州、沈阳及其他各大城市也纷纷掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动的高潮。这表明了全国一切爱国的工商业家正在和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线。我们的国家，正如毛主席的“新民主主义论”中所说明，是几个反对帝国主义的阶级联合起来共同专政的新民主主义的国家。全国各地工商业家和工人、农民及知识分子这样结成的比过去更强大的爱国统一战线恰正表示着中国人民民主专政进一步的巩固，因而也正如毛主席所说：“预示着中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。”
