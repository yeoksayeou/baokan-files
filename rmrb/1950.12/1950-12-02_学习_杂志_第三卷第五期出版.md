"Study" Magazine, Volume 3, Issue 5, Published

The fifth issue of Volume 3 of "Study" magazine was published on December 1st. This issue published a commentary entitled "Take Current Affairs Study a Step Further," which summarized the achievements of current affairs study across the country over the past two months. It pointed out that the understanding of U.S. imperialism and the current international and domestic situation should be elevated from the basis of perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and that pro-American, worshipful of America, and fear of America confused thinking should be eliminated from a solid theoretical foundation.

The essays in this issue include Zheng Chang's "Starting from Reality," which introduces a basic viewpoint of Chairman Mao's theory of thought and working methods, and points out how to correctly grasp and apply this thought and working method. Another is Zhao Dingxin's "Summary of Learning on the Mass Line Problem," which explains what the mass line is, how to follow the mass line, etc.

The systematic explanation articles in this issue include Hu Sheng, Yu Guangyuan, and Wang Huide's "Lectures on Basic Knowledge of Social Sciences," Lecture 5, "Social Ideology and Consciousness"; Guo Dali's "On Imperialism," Explanation 5, "International Cartels and Imperialist Wars"; and Wu Enyu's three articles "Annotations on Lenin's 'State and Revolution'." The "Reader Discussion Forum" published two articles, "Starting from Analyzing Wang Dingchen's Thoughts" and "Show Him More Facts." In addition, there are study materials compiled by Shen Zimin, Ding Mingnan, Xie Lianzao, etc.: "A Century of American Imperialist Aggression Against China," and Zhang Yan's "Why Do Some People Have Insufficient Understanding of American Imperialism?" and other articles.

The "Semi-Monthly Talk" column includes Lin Chuan's "On American Culture," which exposes that American culture is not only lewd and degenerate, but also a complete fascist culture; Zhong Yi's "Who is Afraid of Whom," and Shu Han's "The Thinking of an Ostrich." The "Question and Answer" column answers five questions such as "What impact have the recent major victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in Korea had on the Korean war situation and the world situation?" and "Why is the theory of weapons being the only important factor wrong?".
