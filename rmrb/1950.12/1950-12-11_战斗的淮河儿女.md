The Huai River flood is a historical disaster. But in the hands of the people's government, we will not only fundamentally eliminate this historical disaster, but also begin long-term water conservancy projects.
                        —October 15, 1950, People's Daily Editorial

	Years of Disaster

	On the boat from Bengbu to Huaiyuan, I made friends with a peasant in his mid-40s.

	His name is Ru Xuchu, from Luzhai Village, Zhaomiao Township, Fuyang County. His home is right next to the Xifei River, which floods every year. The land is not enough to cultivate, and his family of three generations has relied on burning kilns for decades. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the five brothers did not separate and had twenty-odd people in the family.

	"Ever since that Chiang Kai-shek bastard breached the Yellow River dike thirteen years ago, people disappeared without a trace on the flat land. For two consecutive years, we couldn't even harvest grain on the high ground. After that, there were big disasters and small disasters every year. Last year, we only harvested 40% of the usual yield, and this year, we didn't harvest a single grain..."

	"Then, what about your kiln?" I asked anxiously.

	"The kiln collapsed long ago due to the flood and can't be fired. With such a big flood, there's no grain and no grass to be harvested, so there's nothing to burn. Besides, the flood has impoverished everyone. No one can afford to build tile-roofed houses, so who needs bricks and tiles? Plus, when the Yellow River sediment comes, the soil quality deteriorates, and the color of the bricks and tiles is not as good as before, so people don't like them.

	"From then on, my father couldn't bear this burden, and he died in one breath and was buried. My brothers split up the family. I cultivated a few mu of land that yielded nothing nine years out of ten. I couldn't make a living, so I relied on a small cart to peddle salt in the Xuzhou area. One trip back and forth was three or four hundred li. My soles became thick, but my stomach became thin."

	"This is really..." An old grandmother behind us sighed, without finishing her sentence.

	"I'm considered fortunate, at least I managed to survive. Sister-in-law Lu Si at the village entrance went out to beg for food with her family of five that year. The next year, only the old couple returned. Old Man Qian, who watched the ancestral hall for others, still hasn't been heard from."

	He was a little excited. Suddenly, he tightened his face, as if he remembered another matter.

	The Story of Nationalist Government's Water Control

	When the boat passed Zhang Village, we talked about this year's flood and Chairman Mao's determination to harness the Huai River. He told me indignantly about the story of water control during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang:

	In the era of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the common people who dug riverbanks and built dams were forcibly conscripted by the Baojia chiefs. Not only were they not given food, but they were also subjected to beatings and scoldings by the Bao chiefs and their lackeys. Although white flour was distributed from above, the common people couldn't even drink gruel.

	Each district (or perhaps each construction section) had a supervising committee member who received several hundred catties of grain from the public every month, but they did nothing. One supervising committee member surnamed Zhu from his area, a local, whose brother was a Bao chief and also held a position in the property exchange (an institution specializing in handling land transactions for others). I don't remember which spring it was, during the busy farming season, when they heard that superiors were coming to inspect the dam. The supervising committee member gathered the young and strong laborers onto the dike overnight, spreading a layer of new soil only an inch or two thick on the dike, covering the not-yet-grown green grass completely, without leaving a single strand. The next day, people sent by the superiors came, ate and drank until they were drunk, and staggered around the dike, and went back very satisfied. Later, they heard that the supervising committee member surnamed Zhu was even credited with a merit.

	In August of the year of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the sweet potatoes in the fields had already grown to the size of fists, but no one cared when the big flood came. The district office was holding a meeting to draft strong laborers, and the supervising committee member didn't care. The crops that were about to be harvested were all ruined. Everyone was angry and complained to the county, but after two hearings, there was no conclusion. The common people didn't have that much time to go to the yamen. Later, they heard that the one surnamed Zhu spent some money and soon came back.

	"Now the People's Government is different. 'The old almanac cannot be used to see the new days.' Chairman Mao is determined to control the Huai River. When the common people heard this, they were all extremely happy. Although my village is barren this year, no one has fled to beg for food. Now everyone is rushing to plant wheat, preparing shovels and baskets to go to the dike."

	The Fighting Sons and Daughters of the Huai River

	On November 20th, the Bengbu cofferdam officially started construction.

	In the morning, the entire city was bustling. Theaters, primary and secondary schools, and squares were all holding meetings to send off the laborers to the dike. The blackboards and slogans on the streets expressed the people's wishes and determination. The labor army, under the enthusiastic send-off, headed for the construction site.

	Flood control hero Wu Shixiang was so moved that he was about to cry. He took out the medal of flood control hero from his pocket and said, "At the celebration meeting, Mayor Ni personally pinned the medal on me and asked me to give a speech at the meeting. If it weren't for the Communist Party, how could we 'poor scholars' have this honor? Today, everyone is so loudly and enthusiastically sending us off. We will never come down without building a good dam." Flood control hero Bao Shuqing said: "This time, we must build the Huai dike well, add merit upon merit, and in the future, Chairman Mao himself will pin a medal on us."

	There was also a welcome meeting at the construction site. Cao Kaixuan, a laborer from Dongxiang Township, said four decisive sentences on the stage: "Great happy event, work harder, unite and help each other, obey the leadership." Female laborer Ding Yingchao said: "Liberated women go to the dike to strive for model status." Countless joy, irrepressible excitement, overflowed at the meeting.

	Early in the morning of the 22nd, I went to the construction site in the west of the city. The great gathering of the Huai River harnessing army was so crowded that it was hard to breathe.

	I visited the Gao Caifa class of the Fifth Detachment of Taiping Township. All seventeen people in the class were full labor power. This morning, the cocks had crowed only once, and the whole class had rushed to work first. Gu Shiming's family had a large population and had not yet planted wheat on ten mu of low-lying land. This year, with the dam built, production will be guaranteed, and he wants to earn more grain to buy wheat seeds. Dai Zhenbang said: "I still lack two mu of wheat seeds. Working harder can not only build a good dam but also earn grain to make up for the wheat."

	The Wang Hualian class is a women's class, fifteen people, all barefoot, lively and energetic, lifting soil together, and everyone wants to add more, straightening their backs and striding forward, to compare with the men. Wang Hualian said: "If you don't work hard to build the dam, you won't even be able to drink thin porridge next year if there's a flood."

	The sun shines brightly on everyone's faces, radiating a red glow. The fighting sons and daughters of the Huai River will forever radiate light on the Huai dike.

    战斗的淮河儿女
    吕子都
    淮河的水灾是一个历史性的灾害。但是到了人民政权手中，我们不但要根本消灭这个历史性的灾害，并且即将开始长期的兴利工程。
                        一九五○年十月十五日人民日报社论
    灾难的岁月
    在从蚌埠到怀远的船上，我与一位四十五六岁的庄稼汉交成了朋友。
    他叫汝旭初，阜阳县赵庙乡路寨村人。家就紧靠在年年发水的西淝河边上，地不够种，祖孙三代几十年来靠烧窑过日子。在抗战前，弟兄五个没分家，有二十来口人。
    “打从十三年前蒋介石那小子扒开黄河堤后，平地里人不见头儿。一连两年，连岗地上也收不了粮食，以后大灾小灾年年有，去年只收四成年景，今年可又一粒不收了。……”
    “那么，你家的窑呢？”我急切地问。
    “窑早就给淹坍了，不能烧。那末大的水，不收粮食不收草，没啥烧的。再说，大水把大家都洗穷了，盖不上瓦房，谁还要砖瓦？加上黄河泥沙一来，土质变坏了，烧出来的砖瓦成色比不上从前，人家也不喜要。
    “从此，俺爷操不了这份心，一口气来不了，入了土。我弟兄分了家。我种了几亩十年九不收的庄稼，混不过去，就靠一辆小车，到徐州一带贩盐卖；一趟来回三四百里，脚底板厚了，肚肠子却细了。”
    “这真是……”背后一位老奶奶叹着气，没说完话。
    “我还算不错的，好歹总算顶过来了。村口路四嫂那年一家五口出去逃荒，隔年只剩老夫老妻俩回来。替人看祠堂的钱老头，到如今还没有个音信。”
    他有点激动，突然，又绷紧了脸，好像想起了另一桩心事。
    国民党治水的故事
    船过张庄，我们又谈了些今年水灾和毛主席决心治淮的情况。他激愤地告诉我关于国民党反动统治时代治水的故事：
    在国民党反动统治时代，老百姓扒河打坝子，是由保甲长强拉硬派的，非但不给粮食，还要遭保长和他的狗腿子打骂，虽然上面发下了白面，但老百姓连糊子也喝不上。
    每个区（或许是每一工段吧）设一个监工委员，每月领公家好几百斤粮食，但什么事都没干。他那里一个姓朱的监工委员，本地人，兄弟当保长，自己又兼了产行（一种专门代人经手田地买卖的机构）的差事。记不起是那一年的春天，正在农忙时节，听说上级要来看坝子了，监工委员连夜召集青壮民工上堤，在堤上敷了一层寸把二寸厚的新土，把长得还不大长的青草盖得干干净净，不露一根毛。隔天，上级派人来了，吃得醉薰薰地在堤上颠三倒四地逛了一趟，很满意地回去了，后来听说姓朱的监工委员还记了一次功。
    抗战胜利的那年八月间，地里的红芋已经长得拳头那么大了，来了大水没人问，区公所正在开会抽壮丁，监工委员不管事，眼见就要到手的庄稼全给毁了。大家气不过，告到县里去，过了两次堂，没了结，老百姓那有这么多功夫上衙门，后来听说姓朱的花了些钱，不久就回来了。
    “现在人民政府可不同了，‘老皇历不能看新日子’啦，毛主席决心要治好淮河，老百姓听了个个高兴得了不得。我村上今年虽然荒啦，但就没有一个逃荒的，现在大家都在赶种小麦，预备好铁锹、箩筐上堤去。”
    战斗的淮河儿女
    十一月二十日，蚌埠圈堤正式开工。
    上午，整个市区都闹开了，戏院、中小学校、广场都在开会欢送民工上堤，街头的黑板报和标语，表示着人民的愿望和决心。各路劳动大军，在热烈的欢送下，齐向工地进发。
    防汛功臣吴士祥感动得快要流泪，从怀里掏出了防汛功臣的奖章，说：“在庆功大会上，倪市长亲自为我挂奖章，还让我在会上演讲。要不是来了共产党，我们这号“穷酸”那有这份光荣；今天大家又这样大吹大打的来欢送，不打好坝子，决不下来。”防汛功臣鲍树清说：“这一回定要把淮堤打好，功上加功，将来毛主席他老人家也会为我们挂章子。”
    到工地还有个欢迎会，市东乡民工曹开宣在台上斩钉截铁地说了四句话：“大喜事，加油干，团结互助，服从领导。”女民工丁颖超说：“翻身妇女上堤争模范。”说不尽的喜悦，抑不住的兴奋，在会上洋溢开了。
    二十二日一早，我到城西工地，一望无际的治淮大军的大会师，拥挤得使人透不过气来。
    我访问了太平乡第五分队高彩法班。全班十七人，全是整劳动力，今晨鸡才叫一遍，全班都抢先上工了。顾世明家里吃口多，还有十来亩洼地没种上麦子，今年打了坝子生产有保障，想多挣点粮买麦种。戴振邦说：“我还少二亩地麦种，多干点活既打好坝又可挣粮把麦子补上，前方打坝也不能误了后方生产。”
    王花莲班是妇女班，十五个人，生龙活虎地个个打赤脚，抬起土来大家要加多，挺腰健步，要和男子比一比。王花莲说：“打坝不卖劲，来年淹了连稀饭也喝不上。”
    太阳照耀得每一个人的脸上泛着红光，战斗的淮河儿女，在淮堤上永远发射着光芒。
