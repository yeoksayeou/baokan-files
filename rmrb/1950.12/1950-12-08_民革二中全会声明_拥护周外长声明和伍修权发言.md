Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today adopted a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue. The full text is as follows:

Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of December 4th regarding the Japanese peace treaty issue, concerning the draft plan in the U.S. memorandum to the Soviet Union, exposes the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression. This statement points out that since 1947, American imperialism has continuously attempted to undermine the process of the Japanese peace treaty, and now even attempts to overturn the foundation of the joint Japanese peace treaty, which is clearly an attempt to overturn the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the basic policy towards post-surrender Japan agreed upon and adopted by the Far Eastern Commission. The ultimate goal of this conspiracy by American imperialism, which violates international agreements, is to seize Japan, enslave the Japanese people, and transform Japan into a U.S. colony and a military base for aggression against the Asian people. Now, the armed intervention by American imperialism in our Taiwan Province, the frenzied actions of expanding the war of aggression against Korea, and the open arming of Japan to rebuild Japan's aggressive forces all fully demonstrate and admit all the conspiracies and tricks it has used on the Japanese peace treaty issue. We fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and solemnly warn the American imperialist aggressors: (1) The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people, and it must participate in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the Japanese peace treaty. Otherwise, as Foreign Minister Zhou stated, everything is illegal and therefore invalid. (2) The foundation of the Japanese peace treaty must be fully in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission towards post-surrender Japan, and oppose the arrogant and shameless conspiracy and proposition of the American imperialists who claim “any or all of the belligerent nations willing to make peace with Japan on the basis of the suggested possible agreement.” (3) According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance of February 14, 1950, the Chinese and Soviet governments agree to jointly achieve the conclusion of a Japanese peace treaty with other Allied nations during World War II within the shortest possible time; and oppose the American imperialists' delaying tactics, illegally implementing long-term occupation of Japan, threatening peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, on the 2nd, passed a telegram to Representative Wu Xiuquan stating: Your speech at the United Nations Security Council sternly expressed the firm will of the 500 million Chinese people to oppose aggression and defend peace. American imperialism, using its voting machine in the United Nations, openly vetoed our peace-keeping proposal, which nakedly exposes the hideous face of American imperialism's conspiracy to expand aggression. We warmly support your just struggle at the United Nations representing the Chinese people and resolutely support the three proposals you put forward in the case of accusing American imperialism of aggression and the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet Union regarding American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan.

    民革二中全会声明
    拥护周外长声明和伍修权发言
    【新华社六日讯】中国国民党革命委员会第二届第二次中央委员会全体会议本日通过拥护周外长关于对日和约问题声明的声明，全文如下：
    周外长十二月四日关于对日和约问题，就美国致送苏联备忘录中所拟定的方案，作了一个揭发美帝侵略阴谋的声明。这一声明，指出了美帝自一九四七年来，不断地企图破坏对日和约的程序，而且到现在更企图推翻共同对日和约的基础，也就是明显地企图推翻开罗宣言，雅尔达协定，波茨坦公告，及远东委员会所同意通过的对投降后日本之基本政策。美帝这一违反国际协议的阴谋与最后目的，就是想霸占日本，奴役日本人民，变日本为美国的殖民地和侵略亚洲人民的军事基地。现在由于美帝武装干涉我台湾省，由于扩大侵朝战争的狂暴行动，由于公开武装日本以重建日本的侵略势力，都充分地证明了和招认了它在对日和约问题上所使用的一切阴谋诡计。我们完全拥护周外长的声明并正告美帝国主义侵略者：（一）中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，它必须参加对日和约的准备、拟制与签订。否则正如周外长所声明地一概是非法的，因而也是无效的。（二）对日和约的基础必须完全依照开罗宣言，雅尔达协定，波茨坦公告及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策，反对美帝所谓“缔约国家：任何或一切愿意在所建议的可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家”的狂妄无耻的阴谋和主张。（三）根据一九五○年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏两国政府同意与第二次世界战争时期其他盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结；反对美帝国主义采取了拖延政策，非法地实行长期占领日本，威胁着远东以及全世界的和平与安全。
    【新华社六日讯】中国国民党革命委员会第二届第二次中央委员会全体会议，二日通过致伍修权代表电称：您在联合国安理会上的发言，严正地表达了全中国五万万人民反对侵略保卫和平的坚强意志。美帝国主义运用它在联合国的表决机器，公然否决了我国保卫和平的建议案，这正赤裸裸地暴露了美帝阴谋扩大侵略的狰狞面目。我们热烈的支持您在联合国代表全中国人民所进行的正义的斗争，坚决拥护您在控诉美帝侵略案中所提出的三项建议和苏联提出的关于美帝侵略台湾的决议草案。
