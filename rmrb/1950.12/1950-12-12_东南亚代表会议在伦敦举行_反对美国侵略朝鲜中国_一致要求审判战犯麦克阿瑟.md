    一致要求审判战犯麦克阿瑟
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦九日电：东南亚代表会议十二月八日在伦敦康威大厦举行。会议的呼声增添了不断高涨的抗议力量，反对美国侵略朝鲜和中国并反对美国政府领袖们叫嚣战争的声明。会议通过一个决议，要求立即停止在朝鲜的军事行动，和平解决朝鲜战争，立即从朝鲜和台湾撤退美国和其他所有外国帝国主义的军队。会议并要求“让中华人民共和国获得它应该享有的在联合国所有机构中的会籍，以便为远东的公正和稳定的和平局面开辟道路”。会议的参加者一致要求任命一个独立的国际法庭来审判麦克阿瑟将军对依照他的命令在朝鲜战争中所犯的一切暴行的责任。
    在会议中发言揭穿美国在远东的侵略的印度记者辛格强调指出：“今天，美帝国主义者威胁中国和朝鲜的城市；明天，他们很可能威胁德里，喀喇蚩和仰光。”
    在康威大厦的会议中，许多发言人谴责英法两国对马来亚和越南人民的侵略。
