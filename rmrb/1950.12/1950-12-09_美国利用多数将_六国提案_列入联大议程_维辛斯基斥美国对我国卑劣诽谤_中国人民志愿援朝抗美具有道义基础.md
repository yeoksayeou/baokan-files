Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, New York, December 8th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of December 6th in the crowded meeting hall at Lake Success to discuss the suggestion by the delegations of six countries, including Cuba, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, Ecuador, and France, to include a proposal titled "Intervention in Korea by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China" on the agenda of the General Assembly. As previously reported, the General Committee, under pressure from the US delegation, had decided on the 5th to recommend that the General Assembly include this proposal on its agenda and submit it to the Political Committee for consideration.

At the plenary session of the General Assembly, Assembly President Entezam announced the General Committee's decision and immediately began the discussion on this suggestion. The first speaker, Philippine representative Romulo, said that the six-nation proposal was an unprecedented and extremely urgent issue.

Romulo rehashed the hackneyed tunes of the United States regarding the Korean situation, trying to prove that it was not the Chinese People's Volunteer Army but the army of the People's Republic of China that was fighting in Korea.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky then spoke, and at the beginning of his speech, he proved that the Philippine representative's remarks in support of the six-nation proposal and the so-called measures that must be taken to protect the "Republic of Korea" were completely untenable. Vyshinsky said that when everyone sees that the bloody armed intervention of the US military against the Korean people has been going on for more than five and a half months, if anyone asserts that the so-called Korean "United Nations forces" are protecting the Korean people and the Korean state, then he is completely disregarding the facts.

In his speech, Vyshinsky convincingly proved that the six-nation proposal was without any basis. He listed facts to show that from the beginning of the Korean incident, the US representatives have been taking various measures to try to divert world public opinion's attention away from the true instigators of the bloody incident in Korea. Since the United States has embarked on the road of blatant aggression, it has not hesitated to invade the People's Republic of China while implementing its predatory plans. Vyshinsky reminded the assembly of the incidents of the US Air Force repeatedly bombing the northeastern territory of China and the US Navy blockading the Chinese coast, and the US Seventh Fleet invading the territorial waters of Taiwan, which is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

Vyshinsky emphasized that the proposers or supporters of this proposal cannot and will not be able to present any facts or evidence of the so-called "intervention in Korea by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China." Vyshinsky elaborated on the attitude of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China towards the development of the Korean situation, which has been striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is evidenced by the repeated peaceful proposals made by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. However, all of its peaceful appeals have not been answered.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the entire record of US policy toward China warned the Chinese people not to remain calm when foreign aggressors appeared in their neighboring areas. Because the Chinese people remember that for many years, the US ruling clique has never been stingy with money, weapons, and ammunition to support the enemies of the Chinese people. Vyshinsky emphasized that the Chinese people and the Korean people have a long-standing friendship, and because of this friendship, the Chinese liberation movement received the support of the Korean people. Therefore, the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China justly pointed out that the Chinese people's volunteer aid to Korea to resist American aggression has a moral basis.

The six-nation delegation and some delegations that support them attempted to portray the position and actions of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the intervention of the Chinese army in Korea. Vyshinsky used facts to show that this attempt was completely untenable.

He cited many historical facts to show that there have been cases where citizens of certain countries supported the liberation movements of other countries, as was the case when the thirteen British American colonies revolted against British rule. It was only because of the victory of the liberation struggle against the British masters that the republican United States of America was established. The French volunteer army, under the leadership of Lafayette and with the active assistance of Beaumarchais and others, helped this struggle.

The defenders of the Spanish Republic were also helped by people from many countries, including the American contingent named "Lincoln."

Vyshinsky emphasized that the accusation against the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is untenable, not only as evidenced by historical facts but also by recognized principles and standards of international law and the provisions of international agreements. Vyshinsky cited the contents of several clauses in the Fifth and Thirteenth Regulations of the Hague Convention, which were also signed by the proposing countries of the six-nation proposal.

The head of the Soviet delegation declared that all arbitrary words that insist that the army of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is fighting on the side of the North Korean government in Korea are groundless and a frivolous fabrication intended to mislead world public opinion and cover up the US military's armed intervention in Korea.

Vyshinsky concluded by declaring that the Soviet delegation opposes placing the issue suggested by the six-nation delegation on the agenda and will vote against this suggestion, believing that it has no moral, political, or legal basis.

### 美国利用多数将“六国提案”列入联大议程  维辛斯基斥美国对我国卑劣诽谤  中国人民志愿援朝抗美具有道义基础

    美国利用多数将“六国提案”列入联大议程
    维辛斯基斥美国对我国卑劣诽谤
    中国人民志愿援朝抗美具有道义基础
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：联合国大会于十二月六日上午在成功湖拥挤不堪的会议厅中举行全体大会，讨论古巴、挪威、英国、美国、厄瓜多尔、法国等六国代表团所提把名为“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的议案列入大会议程的建议。前已报道，总务委员会前在美国代表团行使压力下已于五日决定建议大会把这个议案列入大会议程并且把它提交政治委员会审议。
    在大会全体会议上，大会主席安迪让宣布了总务委员会的这个决议，随即开始对于这个建议的讨论。第一个发言者菲律宾代表罗慕洛说六国提案是一个空前未有的极端紧迫的问题。
    罗慕洛重弹美国对朝鲜事件发表的滥调，力图证明在朝鲜作战的不是中国人民志愿部队而是中华人民共和国的军队。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基接着发言，他在发言开始时即证明了菲律宾代表支持六国提案的言论和所谓必须采取措施，得到联合国保护“大韩民国”的言论是完全不能成立的。维辛斯基说，当人人都看到美军反对朝鲜人民的血腥武装干涉已进行了五个半月有余的时候，若有人断言所谓朝鲜“联合国军队”正在保护朝鲜人民和朝鲜国家，那他一定完全蔑视了事实。
    维辛斯基在其演说中令人信服地证明，六国提案是没有任何根据的。他历举事实说明从朝鲜事件一开始起，美国代表们就一直在采取各种办法想把世界舆论的注意力从朝鲜血腥事件的真正发动者身上转移开去。美国既然走上了公然侵略的道路，它在实施其掠夺计划时便毫不犹豫地也对中华人民共和国进行侵略。维辛斯基提醒大会注意美国空军多次轰炸中国东北领土的事件，美国海军封锁中国海岸，与美国第七舰队侵入台湾的领海的事件，而台湾乃是中国领土不可分的一部分。
    维辛斯基着重指出，这个提案的提案人或提案的支持者，现在和将来都举不出任何所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的事实，也提不出任何证据来。维辛斯基详述中华人民共和国中央人民政府对于朝鲜局势发展的态度，它一直力图和平解决朝鲜问题。中华人民共和国中央人民政府向安理会及向联合国秘书长所再三提出的和平建议就证明了这一点。然而，它的这一切和平呼吁却一直没有得到答复。
    维辛斯基指出，美国对华政策的全部记录都警告中国人民不要在外国侵略者在邻境出现的时候仍然采取安然自若的态度。因为中国人民记得，许多年来，美国统治集团为了支持中国人民的敌人，从来就不曾吝惜过金钱、武器和弹药。维辛斯基强调指出，中国人民和朝鲜人民有着历史悠久的友谊，由于这种友谊，中国的解放运动获得了朝鲜人民的支持。因此，中华人民共和国外交部的声明里即公正地指出，中国人民志愿援助朝鲜抵抗美国侵略是有道义的基础的。
    六国代表团以及某些支持它们的代表团企图把中华人民共和国中央人民政府的立场和它的行动，形容为中国军队对朝鲜的干涉，维辛斯基以事实表明这种企图是完全站不住脚的。
    他援引许多历史事实，表明曾经有过某些国家的公民支持他国的解放运动，如英属美洲十三个殖民地发生反对英国统治的起义时情形就是这样，由于当时反对英国主人的解放斗争获得胜利，才有了共和的美利坚合众国的建立，在拉斐德领导下并获得了布马歇等人积极援助的法国志愿军就曾帮助过这个斗争。
    西班牙共和国的保卫者也曾受到许多国家的人民的帮助，其中包括以“林肯”命名的美国支队。
    维辛斯基着重指出：对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府的控诉之不能成立，不仅为历史事实所证明，而且也为公认的原则和国际法的标准及国际协定的条规所证明。维辛斯基举出六国提案提案国也曾参加签订的海牙公约第五和第十三项法规中若干条款的内容。
    苏联代表团团长宣称：所有硬说中华人民共和国中央人民政府的军队正在朝鲜站在北朝鲜政府方面作战的武断之词都是缺乏根据的，而且是一种企图达到迷惑世界舆论与掩护美国军队武装干涉朝鲜的卑劣目的的无聊捏造。
    维辛斯基结语宣称：苏联代表团反对将六国代表团所建议的问题列入议程，并将对这个建议投反对票，认为它没有任何道义的、政治的或法律的基础。
