    First Group of Volunteer Stretcher-Bearers from Ji'an, Liaodong, Return from Korea with Meritorious Service in Rescuing the Wounded
    Squad Captures More Than Twenty Enemy Stragglers

    [By Our Newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: The first group of stretcher-bearers from Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, who volunteered to cross the Yalu River to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, have returned with merit. More than 100 of them, including Guo Weiqing, were awarded the title of Stretcher-Bearing Model. All circles in Ji'an County specially held a celebration meeting to congratulate them. The villagers who returned from carrying stretchers across the river this time said that they traveled hundreds of miles through wind, snow, and mountains. The heroic deeds of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as the warm hospitality of the Korean people, increased everyone's confidence and strength in supporting the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In Digou Village, the second district, which was strafed by American aircraft, all twenty-one stretcher-bearers collectively performed meritorious service. Regardless of wind or snow, they closely followed the troops, and fearing that the wounded would freeze, they covered the wounded with quilts and cotton clothes. Zhang Yucai, who was awarded first-class merit, stayed with the seriously wounded every day, feeding them water, food, washing their wounds, changing their dressings, and buying food to comfort them. Stretcher-bearer Li Junzhi once took care of a seriously wounded person for four days and four nights without sleep, using his rice ladle to collect urine for the wounded. The wounded comrade said with emotion: "After I recover from my injuries, I will definitely eliminate more American bandits to repay you!" Guo Weiqing, a stretcher-bearing model during the Four Defenses of Linjiang, has once again performed meritorious service in volunteering to participate in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. He carried stretchers particularly steadily, walking and lowering them gently, creating a "sedan chair" carrying method, which reduced the pain of the wounded, and all the stretcher-bearers in the team came to learn from him. Li Genzhi, a Korean from Taipingjiangkou Village in the second district, had crossed fierce artillery fire countless times during the Chinese People's Liberation War to transfer the wounded; this time, he led a small team of volunteer stretcher-bearers, flexibly applying his past experience. Once, they encountered a strafing attack by the heinous American aircraft, and he unhesitatingly used his body to protect the wounded. His heroic actions moved every member of the team, and from departure to victorious return, not a single member fell behind. Qu Hongyi, who had fought guerrillas in the Ji'an area during the Four Defenses of Linjiang, is already over fifty years old this year. This time, he volunteered to go to Korea, and while rescuing the wounded, he captured two prisoners alive. A squad, while transporting the wounded, captured more than twenty stragglers from the Li Chengwan bandit army alive and seized two large guns. This time across the river, everyone more clearly realized the strength of the Chinese and Korean people, and more clearly realized that the United States is just a paper tiger that cannot fight but only slaughters ordinary people. At the celebration meeting, everyone unanimously stated: "If we don't eliminate the American bandits, we won't be able to live a good life. This time we have gained experience, and if we have the opportunity, we will go again."

    【本报讯】据东北日报讯：辽东辑安县第一批志愿过江抗美援朝的担架队员们带着功劳回来了。其中郭维清等一百多名荣膺担架模范。辑安县各界特意召开了一个庆功大会来给他们贺喜。这次过江抬担架回来的老乡讲，他们迎风冒雪，跋山涉水，一共走了数百里路。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英雄事迹，以及朝鲜人民的热情招待，给大家增加了支持抗美援朝斗争的信心和力量。二区地沟村受过美机扫射，这村的担架队员二十一人集体立了功。他们不管风雪，紧紧跟着部队，怕伤员冻着，就都把被子和棉衣盖在伤员身上。立一等功的张玉财，每天和重伤员住在一起，喂水、喂饭、洗伤口、换药，买食品慰问伤员。担架队员李俊智，有一次为照顾重伤员，四天四宿没睡觉，他拿吃饭用的瓢给重伤员接尿。伤员同志感动地说：“伤好以后，一定多消灭美国强盗来报答你们！”四保临江时的担架模范郭维清，这回又在志愿赴朝参战中立了功。他抬担架特别沉着，轻走轻放，创造了“抬轿式”的抬法，减轻了伤员的痛苦，全队的担架员都来跟他学习。二区太平江口村朝鲜人李根植，在中国人民解放战争中曾经多少次的穿过猛烈的炮火转运伤员；这回他领了一小队志愿担架队员，灵活地运用着过去的熟练的经验。有一次他们遇到万恶的美机扫射，他毫不迟疑地用自己的身体来掩护伤员。他这些英雄的行动感动了每一个队员，从出发到胜利而归，全队没有一个掉队的。四保临江时在辑安一带打过游击的曲洪一，今年已经是五十多岁了，这次志愿到朝鲜去，在抢救伤员的时候，活捉了两名俘虏。有一个小队在转运伤员的中途，活捉李承晚匪军的散兵二十多名，缴了两枝大枪。这次过江，大家更清楚地认识到了中朝人民的力量，更清楚地认识到美国是只纸老虎，不能打仗，只会残杀老百姓。在庆功会上大家一致表示：“不把美国强盗消灭掉，咱们就不能过好日子，这回有了经验，有机会咱还去。”
