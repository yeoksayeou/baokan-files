    Introducing "On Soviet Patriotism"
    (Published by Mass Bookstore)
    Chang Dong
    The book "On Soviet Patriotism" is a collection of thirteen articles, the compilation of which is somewhat cumbersome, but the content is excellent. The preface excerpts a passage from Stalin's book "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union."
    The editorial of "Bolshevik" magazine, "On Soviet Patriotism" (translated by Wu Min), outlines the general theory of Soviet patriotism. The harmonious and consistent interests of the working people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union under the socialist system are the source of Soviet patriotism. Explaining the superiority of this socialist system is an important part of patriotic education. The author writes: "The entire history of our country's development irrefutably proves that the Soviet economy, which knows no crisis or turmoil, is undoubtedly superior to the capitalist economy, which is torn apart by various irreconcilable contradictions; the Soviet state system—a truly people's socialist democracy—is superior to the capitalist state system, is superior to bourgeois democracy; the advanced and constantly progressing and developing socialist culture is superior to bourgeois culture." Explaining the great advantages of socialism to the people can inspire all nationalities to unite and fight to defend and develop the great happiness of socialism. As Chairman Mao said, the support of the people determines everything. The root of the Soviet victory in the anti-fascist war lies here: "The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 demonstrated to the world the brilliant example of Soviet citizens' patriotism, demonstrating their greatest, unprecedented, entire people's creation of meritorious service and the example of heroism, these meritorious services and heroism, are expressed in battle and labor, and its purpose is for the victory of the socialist motherland."
    The author further points out how to be a patriotic citizen: "To be a Soviet patriot means to be infinitely loyal to the great cause of the party of Lenin and Stalin, to the cause of communism, to fight for the rapid restoration and development of the national economy, to strive to continuously improve labor productivity, to strictly abide by state discipline, and to tirelessly care about the foundation of our motherland's power—the development and consolidation of the socialist economy. Under the conditions of sharp struggle between the socialist and democratic camp and the imperialist reactionary forces' camp, to be a Soviet patriot means to consolidate the economic and military power of the socialist motherland with all our strength, and to have keen vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialist reactionaries and various anti-Soviet tricks of the reactionary imperialist camp."
    Vyshinsky's "Patriotism and Cosmopolitanism" (translated by He Ge) sharply exposes the hypocritical patriotic concepts and national aggression conspiracies of the imperialists. The author quotes Lenin's famous saying: "When it comes to the private property of capitalists and landlords, they forget all their patriotism." "My motherland is where investment is profitable and profits are higher"—this is the view of the reactionary bourgeoisie. The author writes: "True, practical patriotism is to protect the interests of the people; therefore, it is clear that the bourgeoisie does not have and cannot have true patriotism; their desire to make money and get rich is completely in line with the cosmopolitanism that has no motherland." The author also quotes Marx, saying: "Since the bourgeoisie's financial, trade, and business activities have acquired a cosmopolitan nature, their true patriotism has become pure deception."
    Now, the scholars employed by U.S. imperialism and its vassal states are vigorously advocating the "cosmopolitanism" of abolishing nations and abolishing countries. The author correctly points out the essence of this reactionary cosmopolitanism: "Cosmopolitanism—this is the shameless imperialism's 'internationalism' 'philosophy'; this, on the one hand, is the 'philosophy' of the imperialist viper, preparing to devour all other nations, on the other hand, this is the 'philosophy' of the traitor, willing to let his own nation become the devoured." "Propagating the abolition of nationality, ignoring the national interests of the people, this means agreeing with the powerful nation to oppress and enslave the weak nation. National nihilism and cosmopolitanism are bourgeois, imperialist ideas, which are completely irrelevant to the proletariat, which leads the working masses and is the representative of the people's interests and the loyal defender of national independence, and are intolerable to them."
    When Bevin obsequiously claimed that all nations "should sacrifice narrow national interests for the common good," the international proletariat was engaged in unremitting struggle for the independence and freedom of all oppressed nations, opposing the viper's "happiness" of the imperialist aggressors. The author points out that the internationalism of the proletariat is completely different from the reactionary cosmopolitanism. Proletarian internationalism is based on the mutual love, unity, respect, and assistance of the working people of all nations. The working people of one country must assist the working people of other countries to achieve independence and freedom in order to realize the independence and freedom of their own country. For example, the struggle of the American working people against the financial capitalists is beneficial to the struggle of the world's oppressed nations' working people; the struggle of the world's oppressed working people against U.S. imperialism also assists the struggle of the American working people. In order to defend the fruits of victory, the Chinese people must assist the Korean people. This assistance is precisely to prevent the flames of U.S. imperialist aggression from burning to our motherland. Therefore, it is clear that the spirit of proletarian patriotism and internationalism is consistent.
    Korovchenko's "The Expression of Patriotism in Soviet Literature and Art" (translated by Chen Hanzhang) explains the great success of the Soviet literary and art front and comprehensively reviews the capitalist residual consciousness of a small part of Soviet literary and art workers. The reactionary cosmopolitanism poison of imperialism has infiltrated the minds of this small group of people, and the Soviet ideological circles have carried out serious struggles against them. This is undoubtedly of great educational significance for China, which has just been liberated from the influence of imperialist thought, because the patriotic thought of New Democracy has not yet fully occupied the position.
    The "How the Soviet Union Implements Patriotic Education" co-written by Yesihov and Goncharov (translated by Chen Yuan, originally published in the "Chinese Education Circle" magazine's third volume, seventh issue, and also compiled into the "Ideological and Political Education of Elementary Schools" book compiled by Xinhua Bookstore and the Educational Materials Compilation Society) is particularly worthy of recommendation to educators, as it explains in a simple and profound way the issue of how to cultivate children's patriotic sentiments. Of course, the adoption of these experiences must be carefully considered in combination with the current social situation in our country. We feel that the following two points are particularly worth learning from these experiences:
    The first is the promotion of national self-esteem. Respect and love for the great social reforms carried out by the nation and the state, as well as the heroic achievements, rich and beautiful natural environment in the history of the nation and the state, are necessary conditions for cultivating patriotism. The author quotes Ilyich Lenin's words to illustrate this point:
    "For us, the great Russians, the awakened working masses, is there no national self-esteem? Of course not! We love our language and our motherland, we tirelessly work to improve the lives of the working masses who make up nine-tenths of the total population, so that they can reach the awakened life of democrats and socialists. It makes us very sad to see how the Tsar's executioners, nobles, and capitalists have brutally oppressed and ridiculed our beautiful motherland. We are proud of the fact that all these violent actions have aroused resistance from among us, from among the great Russians, causing the great Russians to produce Radishchev, the Decembrists, and the revolutionary intellectuals of the 1870s, and causing the great Russian working class to create a powerful mass revolutionary party in 1905...."
    For the motherland of our great People's Republic of China, should we not also highly evaluate its history, its heroic achievements, and its beautiful mountains and rivers and abundant resources? This is of great significance for cultivating the patriotic enthusiasm of our people, and our writing circles have obviously not paid enough attention to this aspect.
    The second is to teach children and young people to hate the enemy, expose the evils of the old society, and stimulate their will to defend the new society. And also teach them how to be good at fighting the enemy. The author points out that the first article of the Soviet student code is: "Study diligently, master knowledge, in order to become an educated and cultured citizen and provide the most complete service to the Soviet motherland." This should be putting forward an educational principle: Improving children and young people's sense of responsibility to the motherland is a necessary condition for education to achieve great success. In capitalist countries full of social contradictions, people lack this lofty purpose and are tormented by society. Its education cannot but be backward and reactionary. In socialist and new democratic countries, summoned by the happy future of the motherland and the people, education will inevitably leap forward.
    In addition, the author also introduced many valuable experiences in cultivating students' military knowledge so that they can become soldiers to defend the motherland when necessary, such as the combination of sports and national defense, the education of military knowledge, and the combination of geography, mathematics, and other subjects with the military.
    In addition to the above-mentioned papers, the articles "The Patriotic Spirit of Soviet Youth," "The Famous Soviet People's Hero Chapayev," "Pavlov," "Tanya," and "The Young Guard" in this book introduce the outstanding performance of Soviet patriotism in military struggles and scientific work. In the Soviet anti-fascist war, 3.5 million members of the Youth League won medals and badges, and tens of thousands of young people won the highest honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union. This should become an example for us to learn when our country needs a large number of patriotic young workers and students to participate in modern national defense construction.

    介绍《论苏联的爱国主义》
    （群众书店出版）
    长冬
    《论苏联爱国主义》一书，是编集十三篇文章而成的，编制稍嫌庞杂，但其内容都很精采。文前节录了斯大林《论苏联伟大卫国战争》一书中的一段代序。
    《布尔什维克》杂志社论《论苏联的爱国主义》（吴敏译），概述了苏联爱国主义一般理论。苏联各民族劳动人民，在社会主义制度下利益和谐一致，是苏联爱国主义的来源。而说明这种社会主义制度的优越性就是爱国主义教育的重要内容，作者写道：“我国发展的全部历史，不容争辩地证明了不知危机与动摇为何物的苏维埃经济，是毫无疑问地优越于被各种不可调和的矛盾所撕裂的资本主义经济；苏维埃国家制度——真正全民的社会主义民主制，是优越于资本主义国家制度，是优越于资产阶级民主制；先进的与不断进步、发展着的社会主义文化，是优越于资产阶级的文化。”向人民说明社会主义的伟大优点，就能鼓舞各族人民，团结一致，为保卫与发展社会主义的伟大幸福而斗争，正如毛主席所说，人心向背是决定一切的，苏联反法西斯战争胜利的根源就在这里：“一九四一——一九四五年伟大卫国战争对全世界显示了苏维埃公民爱国主义辉煌的范例，显示了他们最伟大的、史无前例的、全体人民创立功勋与英雄主义的范例，这些功勋与英雄主义，是表现在战斗中和劳动中，其目的是为了社会主义祖国的胜利。”
    作者更指出应该怎样作一个爱国的公民：“作一个苏维埃爱国主义者，这就是说要对列宁、斯大林党的伟大事业，对共产主义的事业无限忠诚，要为迅速恢复与发展国民经济而斗争，要为不断提高劳动生产率而努力，要最严格地遵守国家纪律，不懈地关心我们祖国威力的基础——社会主义经济的发展与巩固。在社会主义与民主的阵营和帝国主义反动势力的阵营进行尖锐斗争的条件下，要作一个苏维埃爱国主义者，这就是说，要用一切力量巩固社会主义祖国经济与军事的威力，对于帝国主义反动派的阴谋，对于反动的帝国主义阵营各种反苏诡计，要有敏锐的警觉性。”
    魏申斯基的《爱国主义与世界主义》（何歌译）一文，尖锐地揭穿了帝国主义者的虚伪的爱国观念和民族侵略的阴谋。作者引述了列宁的名言：“当问题涉及资本家和地主们的私有财产时，他们就忘掉了自己的一切爱国主义。”“我的祖国在那投资有利和利润较高的地方”——这就是反动资产阶级的看法。作者写道：“真正的、实际的爱国主义，就是保护人民的利益；因此很明白，资产阶级没有也不可能有真正的爱国主义；他们的赚钱和发财的愿望是完全符合那没有祖国的世界主义的。”作者又引马克思的话道：“自从资产阶级的财政、贸易和企业活动具有了世界主义的性质，他们的真正爱国主义就变为纯粹的欺骗了。”
    现在，美帝国主义及其仆从国家的御用学者们，正在大肆鼓吹取消民族、取消国家的“世界主义”，作者正确地指出这种反动的世界主义的实质：“世界主义——这是无耻的帝国主义的‘国际主义’‘哲学’；这，一方面是帝国主义毒蛇的‘哲学’，准备吞噬掉一切其他民族，另方面，这是卖国贼的‘哲学’，甘愿让自己的民族变成被吞食者。”“宣传取消民族性、漠视人民的民族利益，这意思就是赞同强大民族压迫和奴役弱小民族。民族虚无主义和世界主义是资产阶级的、帝国主义的观念，它跟那领导着劳动大众，作为人民利益的代表和民族独立的忠实保卫者的无产阶级，是完全无关的，是他们所不能容忍的。”
    当贝文奴颜婢膝地声称各民族“应该为共同的幸福而牺牲狭隘的民族利益”时，国际无产阶级却为着各被压迫的民族的独立与自由进行不懈的斗争，反对帝国主义侵略者的毒蛇的“幸福”。作者指出无产阶级的国际主义跟反动的世界主义是完全不同的。无产阶级国际主义是建立在各民族劳动人民互相友爱、团结、尊重与援助的基础上，一个国家的劳动人民为了实现其本国的独立和自由，必须援助其他国家的劳动人民获得独立和自由。比如美国劳动人民反对财阀资本家的斗争，有利于世界被压迫民族劳动人民的斗争；世界被压迫劳动人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，也援助了美国劳动人民的斗争。中国人民为了保卫胜利果实，必须援助朝鲜人民，这种援助，也正是使美帝国主义侵略战火不致燃烧到我们祖国来。所以，很明白，无产阶级的爱国主义与国际主义的精神是一致的。
    柯洛夫青柯的《爱国主义在苏联文学和艺术中的表现》（陈汉章译），说明了苏联文艺战线的伟大成功，并综合评述了苏联一小部分文艺工作者的资本主义残余意识，帝国主义的反动的世界主义毒素渗入了这一小部分人的头脑中，苏联思想界对它们进行了严肃的斗争。这，对于刚从帝国主义思想影响下解放出来的中国，由于新民主主义爱国思想还没有充分占领阵地而有极大教育意义，是无待多说的。
    叶西霍夫和冈察罗夫合写的《苏联如何实施爱国主义教育》（陈原译，原载《中华教育界》杂志复刊三卷七期，新华书店出版、教育资料丛刊社编的《小学的思想与政治教育》一书，也编入了），是特别值得向教育工作者推荐的，它深入浅出地说明了应该如何培养儿童的爱国情操的问题。当然，采用这些经验，必须结合我国目前社会的情况，加以审慎考虑。我们觉得这些经验中特别值得学习的是下面两点：
    第一是民族自尊心的提倡。对于民族与国家所进行的伟大社会改革工作以及民族与国家历史上的英雄业迹、富饶和美丽的自然环境的尊敬与爱慕，是培养爱国主义的必要条件。作者引述伊里奇·列宁的话来说明了这点：
    “对于我们，伟大的俄国人，觉醒的劳苦大众，难道民族自尊心是没有的么？当然不是！我们爱我们的言语和我们的祖国，我们不倦地工作，来提高占全人口十分之九的劳苦大众的生活，使他们能够达到民主主义者和社会主义者的觉醒生活。眼见身受沙皇刽子手、贵族和资本家如何使我们美丽的祖国遭受残暴压迫和嘲弄，这使我们很伤心。我们值得骄傲的是这样的事实：这一切暴戾的行动，从我们中间激起了反抗，从伟大的俄罗斯人中间激起了反抗，使伟大的俄国人产生拉狄许且夫、十二月党人和七十年代的革命的知识阶级，使伟大的俄罗斯工人阶级在一九○五年创造了一个强大的群众的革命政党。……”
    对于我们伟大中华人民共和国的祖国，难道不是同样要崇高地评价它的历史、它的英雄事业，以及它的美丽的山川和富饶的资源么？这对于培养我们人民的爱国热情，是有十分重大意义的，而我们著作界对这方面显然还注意不够。
    第二是教导儿童和青年去憎恨敌人，揭露旧社会的罪恶，激发他们保卫新社会的意志。而且还要教会他们如何善于跟敌人斗争。作者指出苏联学生守则第一条就是：“勤奋学习，精通知识，以便成为一个受过教育的和有文化的公民，为苏维埃祖国作最完备的服务。”这里应该是提出了一个教育学的原则：提高儿童和青年对祖国的责任感，是使教育工作获得伟大成绩的必要条件。在充满社会矛盾的资本主义国家，人们缺少这种崇高的目的，受着社会的折磨，它的教育不能不是退步的、反动的，而在社会主义和新民主主义的国家，为祖国和人民的幸福前途所召唤，教育将必然是飞跃前进的。
    此外，在培养学生军事知识，使他们在必要时能够成为保卫祖国的战士方面，作者也介绍了许多宝贵的经验，例如体育与国防的结合，军事知识的教育，地理数学等课与军事的结合等。
    除以上所述几篇论文外，本书中《苏联青年的爱国主义精神》、《苏联人民著名英雄夏伯阳》、《巴甫洛夫》、《丹娘》、《青年近卫军》诸文，介绍了苏联爱国主义在军事斗争中和科学工作中卓越的表现。在苏联反法西斯战争中，有三百五十万青年团员荣获奖章和勋章，上万青年荣膺苏联英雄的最高荣誉称号，这在我们国家正需要大量爱国青年工人和学生去参加现代国防建设时，应该成为我们学习的榜样。
