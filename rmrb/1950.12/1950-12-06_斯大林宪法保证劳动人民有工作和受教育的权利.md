Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th: The right to work is one of the most important rights guaranteed to the Soviet people by the Stalin Constitution. This right is guaranteed by: the socialist national economic structure, the continuous growth of the Soviet social productive forces, and the elimination of the possibility of economic crises and unemployment.

The number of Soviet workers and staff is increasing year by year. In the third quarter of 1950, the number of employees increased by 2.4 million compared with the third quarter of 1949. The national economy increasingly needs skilled workers, so the government allocates funds to train hundreds of thousands of young people. Every young man and woman in the Soviet Union can learn a trade at the government's expense. Various training classes and schools are established in various enterprises. In this way, workers have the opportunity to learn a major or take advanced technology training without paying fees.

The Soviet government spends a lot of money to improve workers' labor. To achieve this goal, large-scale mechanization has been implemented, resulting in a further increase in labor productivity, thereby increasing the income of the working people and improving their material lives. In 1949, the income per employee increased by 24 percent compared with the pre-war year of 1940. Soviet workers repay the socialist state's care for them with selfless labor and the development of the Stakhanovite movement. They demonstrated infinite initiative and creative efforts to further increase production and improve product quality. Production innovator Zhutkik said: "Our Stakhanovite rule is this: no matter what you do, you must do it excellently, because you are serving the working people."

In Soviet society, labor is a glorious thing. Each citizen's personal ability and personal labor determine his social status. The British workers' delegation, which had visited the Soviet Union, recently published a booklet entitled "The Soviet Union We Saw with Our Own Eyes." Wilson, one of the representatives, wrote in this book: In the Soviet Union, flashy titles and bags of money are not glorious. Those who enjoy honor are the working people. People with good work performance and those who introduce new methods to improve production quality and strengthen production or economy are highly rewarded.

### 斯大林宪法保证劳动人民有工作和受教育的权利

    斯大林宪法保证劳动人民有工作和受教育的权利
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：工作权是斯大林宪法向苏联人民所保证的一种最重要的权利。这种权利的保障就是：社会主义的国民经济机构，苏联社会生产力的不断增长，经济危机和失业可能性的消灭。
    苏联职工的数目正逐年增加。在一九五○年第三季的职工人数较一九四九年第三季增加了二百四十万人。国民经济日益需要熟练工人，因此政府便拨出经费训练数十万的青年。苏联每一个青年男女，都可以由政府出钱而学会一种行业。各企业中都设立各种训练班和学校。这样，工人们就有了不出费用而学习专业或进修技术的机会。
    苏联政府花费大量金钱来改善工人的劳动。为要达到这一目的，就实行了大规模的机械化，结果遂使劳动生产率再一步提高，因而使劳动人民的收入得以增加，物质生活得以改善。在一九四九年，职工每人的收入较战前一九四○年增加了百分之二十四。苏联工人用忘我的劳动和开展斯塔哈诺夫运动来报答社会主义国家对他们的关心。他们表现了无穷的主动性与创造性的努力，以进一步提高生产与改进产品的质量。生产革新者朱特基克曾说过：“我们斯塔哈诺夫的规律是这样的：不论你干什么，你得把它做得很出色，因为你是为劳动人民服务的。”
    在苏维埃社会里，劳动是光荣的事情。每个公民的个人能力与个人劳动决定他在社会上的地位。曾访问过苏联的英国工人代表团最近出版了题为《我们亲眼看到的苏联》的小册子，代表之一维尔逊在这本书里写道：在苏联，华而不实的头衔与铜臭的钱囊是没有什么荣耀的。享受荣誉的是劳动的人们。工作成绩好的人、介绍改进生产质量与加强生产或经济的新的方法的人，均受到极高的报偿。
