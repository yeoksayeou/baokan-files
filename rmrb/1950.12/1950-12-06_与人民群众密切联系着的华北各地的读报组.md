Reading groups in North China have greatly developed and achieved considerable success and experience in the past six months. After the National News Work Conference in April this year, various regions regarded the establishment of reading groups for workers and peasants as an important political task and a key to connecting newspapers with the masses, and vigorously promoted this work. In the rural areas of Chahar, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, the number of reading groups has greatly increased. In Chahar Province, 1,393 reading groups have been organized, including 728 in Yanbei and 80 in Huailai County in September. In Shanxi, PingShun County alone has established 231 reading groups. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties including Zuoquan and YuShe, the number had grown to 304 in August, of which 107 had established contact with newspapers. In Dingxian Prefecture, Hebei, 495 reading groups were established in 398 villages. In Pingyuan Province, there were 700 groups, and in Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, there were 57 groups. In addition, many reading groups have also been established in large and medium-sized cities. The broad masses of workers and peasants are eager to read newspapers. A farmer representative from Huade County, Chahar Province, said: "It's really boring not to read the newspaper. We don't know anything about national affairs, and we just bury our heads in labor." The masses in Sifangfang Village, Shangdu, are very concerned about newspapers. If the newspaper doesn't arrive on time, literate people go to the village office once or twice to inquire, and they have established rules to protect and preserve newspapers. In places with good reading groups, the masses regard newspapers as consultants for their work, and consult newspapers when they don't understand something.

What role do reading groups play among the masses?

Reading groups have played a significant role in promoting production policies, guiding production work, publicizing current affairs, promoting the peace signature campaign, opposing rumors and special agents, breaking superstitions, promoting marriage policies, and improving the cultural level of the masses. In Jia Zhuang, Hunyuan, Chahar Province, the reading group selected and read out the government's decrees protecting the people's property rights to address the masses' concerns about being "divided" and "struggled against" again. After hearing this, the masses' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. A middle peasant, Yu Hai, bought more than 640 jin of hemp seeds this spring to plant. A lazy man, Zi Xiuming, also saved money to buy livestock. After reading the People's Daily editorial "Striving for the Prosperity of North China Farmers' Lives," the masses bought 30 heads of livestock and made and purchased more than 840 new farm tools. In Baitasi Village, Zhuolu, during the peace signature campaign, after the reading group's publicity, 450 of the 503 people in the village signed their names within two days. In Dazhai Village, Yu She, Shanxi, some people wanted to withdraw from the mutual aid group because of unequal value. The reading group read an article about the issue of equivalent value. The group immediately rectified and consolidated again. In Qianlou Village, Ji County, Hebei, the reading group read the summer grain requisition document and made preparations for wheat requisition in advance. The entire village completed the wheat requisition in two days. The Peace Signature Working Group of Tongxian Prefecture reported: "The villages with reading groups have a clearer understanding of the significance of defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression." Many places feel that using reading to promote work is better than holding meetings to deploy work. The masses are most concerned about the policies of the Party and the People's Government and current affairs. Promoting policies and current affairs through reading is the best way to connect with the masses and with reality. The central content of reading should revolve around policy issues and current affairs issues, that is, it must be combined with the urgent needs of the masses and the central work, so as to promote work through reading.

Develop worker and peasant reading groups on the basis of mass awareness and willingness.

The development of worker and peasant reading groups must be based on the masses' conscious willingness, and it is absolutely impossible to be eager for quick success without considering the conditions, and to take coercive methods without persuasion and mobilization. Chahar Province uses local people's representative meetings and labor model meetings to invite worker and peasant representatives and hero model figures to discuss reading and communication work, cultivate them as the backbone, and organize reading through them, which is an effective method. In addition, in areas where reading groups have a preliminary foundation, it is also the best way to establish reading groups and lead reading and communication work to hold reading group representative meetings or correspondent representative meetings with administrative regions and industrial and mining areas as units, and to absorb activists who care about newspapers to participate. Tongxian Prefecture, Hebei, adopted the principle of "establishing key points and gradually expanding," that is, first establishing through base villages, through county and district government stations, and through hero model villages, and then gradually developing, which has also achieved successful experience. Many reading groups with good results in the beginning of the organization started by inducing the masses to read newspapers, and two or three activists read newspapers to the masses informally at any time and place, and paid attention to collecting the masses' reactions, inspiring the majority of the masses to listen to the reading of newspapers, and then gradually expanding the number of reading groups and establishing a set of regular systems. On the contrary, some places gathered the masses to read newspapers in the form of large classes at the beginning, and the masses felt it was a burden. Some places were eager for quick success and attempted to universally promote it in a short period of time, and all failed.

We must create a variety of ways and methods to organize reading groups according to the hobbies and needs of the masses.

For example, some places add some entertainment programs when reading newspapers, play phonographs, and let old artists sing drum songs and tell "The Story of the New Children's Heroes," which is popular with the masses. The reading group in Songshuping, Zuoquan, proposed to grasp the three loves of the masses (love to listen to current affairs, love to listen to policies and instructions, love to listen to production technology and work experience) and to achieve three goods (materials are prepared well, no random talk; read well, do not read articles to death, turn articles into popular speeches; the masses listen well, the audience is interested, the time does not exceed two bowls of rice), which is very suitable for the needs of the masses. The organizational forms in various places include: combining reading work with civil schools and literacy classes, taking newspapers as one of the teaching materials, and reading newspapers to students regularly; combining reading groups with learning culture, with a literacy blackboard in the reading group, and writing out new words when encountered; combining reading groups with bulletin boards, and posting important news from each issue of the newspaper on the bulletin board; combining with communication groups to jointly organize reading groups, not only reading newspapers in a timely manner, but also listening to the opinions of the masses and writing articles for newspapers; combining reading and production, and labor mutual aid groups bringing newspapers to the fields and reading newspapers during rest; setting up reading stations on the streets, etc. These different organizational forms have achieved results because they can meet the requirements of different masses.

The establishment of reading groups must have leadership and organization.

The experience of various places proves that the leadership must attach importance to the establishment of reading groups, so that the work can be carried out with leadership and organization. In particular, the county and district leaders should formulate specific plans, designate special personnel to provide specific assistance, and summarize experience in a timely manner, so that the reading group work can achieve results. In places where reading groups have not been developed, the first is that cadres ideologically neglect to organize the masses to read newspapers, thinking that peasants have low cultural levels and workers are too busy to organize reading. In some places, the number of reading groups developed is also large, but because the leadership only has general calls and no special personnel to manage, it often becomes a formality. In order to strengthen leadership, the members of the reading group must have a certain backbone, which is also very important. The reading groups in Dazhai Village, Xiya Village, Zuoquan Chengguan and other villages are led by the Party branch, with administrative village teachers, intellectuals in the countryside, and propaganda directors as the backbone, and a central guidance group is established to lead the reading groups in this village and natural villages, with very good results.

    与人民群众密切联系着的华北各地的读报组
    章君
    华北各地读报组工作，半年来有很大发展，并获得相当成绩与经验。今年四月全国新闻工作会议后，各地把建立工农读报组工作，当做一项重要政治任务，当做是报纸联系群众的关键之一，用大力开展这个工作。在察哈尔、山西、河北等地农村中，读报组的数量都有了很大发展。察哈尔全省已组织起读报组一三九三个，其中雁北即建立七二八个，怀来县九月份即组织了八十个。山西仅平顺一县即建立了二三一个，左权、榆社等八个县不完全统计，八月份已发展到三○四个，其中一○七个已和报社取得联系。河北定县专区三九八个村建立了四九五个。平原全省有七○○个，绥远省丰镇一县有五七个。此外，在大中城市中，也建立了不少的读报组。广大工农群众迫切要求和报纸见面，察省化德县农民代表说：“不看报实在闷的慌，国家大事啥也不知道，只闷着头劳动。”商都四台坊村群众很关心报纸，报纸到时候不来，识字的人一趟两趟的到村公所去问，并订出爱护和保管报纸的纪律。读报组好的地方，群众都把报纸当做是自己办事的顾问，不懂的事找报纸问。
            读报组在群众中起了什么作用
    读报组对宣传生产政策、指导生产工作及宣传时事、和平签名、反谣反特、破除迷信、婚姻政策与提高群众文化等方面均起了很大作用。察省浑源贾庄读报组为解决群众怕再“分”再“斗”的思想顾虑，从报上选读了政府保护人民财权的法令，群众听了生产情绪大为提高，中农于海今春买了六百四十多斤麻?上地，懒汉子秀明也积钱买了个牲口，他们读了人民日报“为华北农民生活的富裕而奋斗”的社论后，群众买了三十头牲口，制购了八百四十多副新农具。涿鹿白塔寺村在和平签名运动中，经过读报组的宣传，全村五百零三人，两天内即有四百五十人签了名。山西榆社大寨村因互助组内不等价，有的要求退出，读报组就给读了一篇关于等价问题的文章，该组马上作了整顿，又重新巩固起来。河北蓟县前楼村读报组读了夏征文件提前作了麦征准备，全村应征小麦两天全部完成。通县专区和平签名工作组反映：“那村有读报组，那村对保卫世界和平反对侵略战争的意义就认识得清楚一些。”许多地方感到用读报去宣传工作，比开会布置工作还强。群众最关心党和人民政府的政策与时事问题，通过读报去宣传政策与时事，是联系群众联系实际最好的方法。读报的中心内容应当是围绕着政策问题与时事问题，即必须与群众的迫切需要和中心工作相结合，这样才能通过读报来推动工作。
            在群众自觉自愿的基础上，发展工农读报组
    发展工农读报组，一定要建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上，绝不可不看条件，急于求成，不去说服动员，采取强迫命令的方法。察省利用各地人民代表会、劳模会议，邀集工农代表、英雄模范人物座谈读报通讯工作，培养他们为骨干，通过他们组织读报，是一种有效的方法。此外，在读报组有初步基础的地区，以行政区、工矿区为单位，有重点地召开读报组代表会议或通讯员代表会议，并吸收关心报纸的积极分子参加，也是一种建立读报组和领导读报和通讯工作的最好的方法。河北通县专区采取了“重点建立，逐渐展开”的方针，即首先通过基点村，通过县、区机关驻地，通过英雄模范村建立，然后逐渐发展，也取得了成功的经验。许多地方成绩较好的读报组，在开始组织时都是从诱导群众读报兴趣着手，由两三个积极分子不拘形式地随时随地在各种场合给群众读报，并注意收集群众的反映，启发了大多数群众听读报的要求，然后逐渐地扩大了读报组的人数，并建立起一套经常的制度来。相反的，有的地方一开始就用上大课的方式把群众集合起来读报，群众感到是负担，有的地方急于求成，企图在短期内普遍搞起来，结果都失败了。
    必须根据群众的爱好与需要，创造多种多样的方式方法来组织读报组
    如有些地方在读报时加些文娱节目，放留声机，由旧艺人演唱大鼓，说“新儿女英雄传”，受到群众欢迎。左权松树坪的读报组提出掌握群众的三爱（爱听时事，爱听政策、指示，爱听生产技术和工作经验）和作到三好（材料准备好，不乱谈；读的好，不死读条文，把文章变成通俗的讲话；群众听的好，听报人感兴趣，时间不超过两碗饭时），很合乎群众的要求，各地组织形式有：读报工作和民校、识字班结合，把报纸作为教材之一，读报组定期给学员读报；读报组和学习文化相结合，读报组内设有识字小黑板，遇到生字就写出来；读报组与黑板报相结合，把每期报上的重要消息登上黑板报；与通讯组结合共同组织读报组，不但读报及时，还能听取群众意见给报纸写稿；读报和生产相结合，劳动互助组把报纸带到地里，休息时读报；街头设读报站等等。这些不同组织形式因能适合不同群众的要求，而收到效果。
    建立读报组必须有领导、有组织
    各地经验证明，领导上必须重视，使建立读报组工作，有领导、有组织的开展，特别是县、区领导上应订出具体计划，指定专人具体帮助，并及时总结经验，才能使读报组工作做出成绩。凡是读报组没有开展的地方，首先是干部思想上忽视组织群众读报，认为农民文化低工人工作忙无法组织读报。有的地方读报组发展的数量也不少，但因领导上只有一般号召，而无专人管理，往往流为形式。为了加强领导，读报组的成员必须有一定的骨干，这也是很重要的。榆社大寨村、西崖村、左权城关等村的读报组是由党支部来领导，以行政村教员、在乡知识分子、宣传主任为骨干，成立了中心指导小组，领导本村和自然村的读报小组，效果很好。
