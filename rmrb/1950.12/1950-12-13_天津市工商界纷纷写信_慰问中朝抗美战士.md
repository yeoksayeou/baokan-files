We will definitely step up production, unite as one, and resolutely be your strong backing." The Pharmaceutical Industry Association wrote in its letter of salutation: "Comrades! The just struggle to defend peace and resist aggression will certainly receive the support of the broad masses of the people. The Tianjin pharmaceutical industry will step up drug production to ensure the needs of the wounded and sick soldiers." The Paint and Ink Industry Association pledged in its letter of salutation to work hard to produce and improve product quality to support the volunteers fighting on the Korean front. In addition, small handicraft workers and vendors have also collectively written more than sixty letters of salutation.
