    North and South of the Yalu River
    Special correspondent of this newspaper, Yang Shuo
    On a dark December night, I followed a railway volunteer aid Korea team across the Yalu River into North Korea. Something soft brushed my face; it was snowflakes. Looking back, the north bank of the river was shrouded in the smoke of war, with only a few scattered lights remaining. The south bank was even darker, and the air was filled with the smell of burning. Separated by only a river, the Korean land on the south bank was experiencing unprecedented disaster, with every place burning.
    However, it would be a joke to think that the Yalu River is an impregnable border, and that the wildfire set by the American bandits in Korea would not spread to the Chinese territory on the north bank. Today, another group of American planes sneaked to the north bank of the Yalu River, repeatedly bombing the bridge connecting the two lands of China and Korea.
    But it would be even more of a joke to think that bombs could destroy the bridge of flesh and blood that the Chinese and Korean people have built in their hearts! It is precisely through this invisible bridge that the Chinese people have formed various volunteer teams and poured into Korea to fight alongside the Korean people. They understand that what the United States is doing in Korea today is what it will do in China tomorrow. Aiding Korea is aiding ourselves. How can we stand idly by?
    On November 8, when American planes carried out inhumane bombing of Sinuiju on the south bank, more than a dozen doctors and nurses from our railway hospital rushed through the flames and across the river to rescue the wounded Korean civilians from the piles of fire and the edges of bomb craters. Despite the buzzing of planes overhead and the burns on their hands and faces, they had long forgotten themselves. Dong Lu, Deng Chao, Lu Bo Feng, and others are all heroes whose names should be written down this time.
    In fact, which member of our railway aid Korea team is not imbued with this selfless spirit? Railways are the blood vessels of war, and the enemy bombed the stations along the Korean railway into scorched earth. Some coal piles caught fire, smoldering for days and nights. Despite the bombing, the trains continued to run as usual. The enemy became anxious and bombed countless times day and night, turning railway repairs into the most intense battle in the rear.
    There is a bridge here (forgive me for not being able to write its name), and the enemy dropped incendiary bombs, causing a big fire. Without any prompting, the repair team grabbed hooks and buckets and ran from all directions to put out the fire. They went back and forth through the fire, extinguishing the flames, but their own shoes were burned and blisters formed on their heels. Workers Jiang Chengyan and Xu Guodong were practically turned into two firemen, their cotton clothes burning fiercely. Fortunately, they extinguished the fire with water hoses. The line had to be opened by 10 p.m. As soon as it got dark, repairs began immediately. But enemy planes came again, dropping bombs one after another, falling into the river, and the water columns were higher than the bridge. Many workers were stunned, and one person fell under the bridgehead and injured his leg. Here, let me mention the old worker Yi Changgeng with the utmost respect. He is fifty-six years old, and years of hardship have made him as strong as a rock. He saw the worker roll off the bridge, followed him down, and carried the man on his back. Bombs were falling fiercely overhead, and as he walked on the river beach, a bomb knocked him down, covering him with a layer of floating soil. He crawled out of the dirt, carried the man to the shore, struggled to a relatively safe place in one breath, and passed out himself, and was sent to the hospital together. The road? At ten o'clock that night, traffic resumed. The oath of the workers when they volunteered was: "Flying across the river and crossing the sea to resist America and aid Korea!" Now they are shouting: "Even if he can dry up the river, he can't break this bridge!"
    The fighting spirit of the Korean people themselves is even more admirable. As soon as we crossed the river, we met the Korean railway troops and railway workers. They repaired lines and maintained traffic under enemy bombing every night, transporting the supplies needed by the army to the front as much as possible. One day, I went to see a cave near Dingzhou. The cave originally contained a trainload of gasoline. The American troops couldn't take it with them when they fled, so they set it on fire, and the train was burned and blocked the cave. Many Korean soldiers lit piles of firewood for light, shouting orders nervously, and began to pull those dead cars out. In the firelight, I saw a Korean soldier smiling at me. A young lad, very strong, with a red and round face, very free and easy. I gestured to him, and he laughed and said, "Comrade, I'm also from China." It turned out that his name was Park Seok-dong. He had participated in the Chinese Railway Corps, and this year he followed a large team of Korean comrades across the river back to his motherland. They came from China and brought the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Korea. Wherever they went, they fetched water and swept the courtyard for the people, which made an old man in his eighties strangely ask, "Where did you come from?"
    At that time, the Korean People's Army was chasing Li Chengwan's puppet army southward, and Park Seok-dong and his railway troops also chased past Seoul, urgently repairing the railway all the way. When repairing in Dicheon, a house stored fifteen barrels of gasoline. American planes dropped bombs, and the house caught fire. A company commander named Wu Shanglu rushed into the fire and rescued all fifteen barrels of gasoline alone, and was awarded the National Flag Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for it. This is not the only heroic deed of the Korean Railway Corps and railway workers, but this alone shows how the Korean people themselves are fighting in the rear to ensure the victory of the front. Speaking of the present, Park Seok-dong said in a firm tone: "Now that we have the assistance of the Chinese Volunteer Army and have liberated Pyongyang; and with the help of the Chinese Railway Aid Korea Team in the rear, we will definitely be able to repair the railway as soon as possible and eliminate the American devils as soon as possible!" He suddenly smiled and said, "You know, the Korean people call you the 'dumb army'."
    This term has no derogatory meaning at all, but rather a bit of intimate meaning of not distinguishing between each other. Really, since arriving in Korea, we have been like dummies. But no matter which Korean we meet, even though we don't understand each other's language, they always look at us with warm eyes. As long as there is someone who can translate next to us, we have to express our feelings to each other.
    In Xuancheon, a woman named Gui Yuji was draped in a cotton quilt, constantly rocking the baby in her arms and said: "My husband used to work in the Pyongyang Ministry of Internal Affairs. I don't know where he went when we evacuated. If it weren't for the Chinese Volunteer Army to help us, where would I have a way out! Seeing you today is like seeing relatives. I don't have anything else, only a pair of socks, I'll give them to you!" We refused her with a heavy heart and moved by her kindness.
    One late night, Lian Dehao, the security minister of the Korean repair team, sat on the mat on the spot and said softly: "Thinking back to the first few months when we withdrew from Pyongyang, we retreated to the northeast overnight, everyone bowed their heads, wondering where to withdraw! One night, when we walked to Xichuan, in the moonlight, we suddenly saw a troop coming towards us. When we looked closer, it was the Chinese Volunteer Army. Tears fell down, and we couldn't speak. We hugged the neck of the Volunteer Army and just cried!"
    The American bandits are afraid of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and constantly drop shameless provocative leaflets from planes to the ground. But what's the use? The Korean people are discussing these nonsense with a burst of contemptuous laughter. In terms of geographical conditions, although there is a Yalu River separating the Chinese and Korean people on the north and south banks, in the common will to defend their homeland and world peace, this boundary does not exist.

    鸭绿江南北
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    十二月的一个月黑天，我跟着一支铁路援朝志愿大队跨过鸭绿江，到了朝鲜。有些软东西扑到脸上，掉雪花了。回头一望，江北岸已经笼罩着战争的烟火，只剩下三三两两的灯光，江南岸更是黑茫茫一片，空气里飘着糊味。只是一江之隔，南岸的朝鲜土地正经历着从古未有的灾难，没一块地方不在燃烧。
    可是，谁要以为鸭绿江是条铜墙铁壁的边界，美国强盗在朝鲜所放的野火，烧不到北岸中国领土上，那才是笑话。今天，就又有一群美国飞机窜到鸭绿江北岸，反复轰炸连接中国和朝鲜两片土地的桥梁。
    不过谁要以为炸弹能够炸坏中朝人民在心里所建立的血肉相关的桥梁，那才更是笑话！正是通过这座无形的桥，中国人民组成各色各样的志愿队伍，涌到朝鲜，跟朝鲜人民并肩作战。他们明白：美国今天在朝鲜所作的，就是明天要在中国所作的。援救朝鲜，就是援救自己。怎么能隔岸观火呢？
    在十一月八号那天，美国飞机对南岸的新义州进行无人性的轰炸时。我们铁路医院就有十几个医生、护士穿过火焰，跑过江去，从火堆里，从弹坑边上，来往抢救那些受伤的朝鲜和平人民。尽管飞机还在头上嗡嗡的响，烟火烧伤了手脸，他们早忘记了自己。董禄、邓超、卢伯沨等都是这回应该写下名字的英雄人物。
    其实，我们的铁路援朝大队又那个不是抱着这种忘我的精神呢？铁路是战争的输血管，敌人把朝鲜铁路沿线的车站都炸成一片焦土，有的煤堆着了火，几天几夜冒着大烟。炸尽管炸，火车却照样开。敌人急了眼，不分昼夜，无数次的来轰炸，抢修铁路就变成后方最紧张的战斗。
    这里有座桥（恕我不能写出名子），敌人投下烧夷弹，起了大火。也不用招呼，抢修队拿着钩子、水桶，从各路跑去救火。他们在火里穿来穿去，扑灭火，自己的鞋却烧坏了，脚后跟烧起了泡。工友姜成晏和徐国栋简直变成两个火人，棉衣服烧得忽忽的，幸亏拿水龙把火浇熄。夜晚十点一定要通车，天一黑，立时进行抢修。可是敌机又来了，炸弹一个连一个丢下来，掉到江里，水柱激起比桥都高。不少工友震昏了，有个人跌到桥头下摔伤了腿。这里，让我用最大的敬意提到老工人伊长更。他已经五十六岁，多年的苦难磨得他像石头一样顽强。他看见那个工友滚下桥去，跟着跑下去，把那人背到身上。头上的炸弹落的正凶，他正走在河滩上，一颗炸弹把他震倒，浑身被盖上一层浮土。他从土里钻出来，背起那人跑到岸上，一口气挣扎到较比安全地方，自己的也昏倒了，一块被送到病院去。路呢，当夜十点钟，又通车了。工友们在自愿报名时的誓词是：“飞江过海，抗美援朝！”现在却喊着：“他能把河水炸干了，这个桥也炸不断！”
    朝鲜人民本身的斗志更加可敬。一过江，我们就遇见了朝鲜的铁道部队和铁路工人。他们夜夜在敌人的轰炸下抢修线路，维持行车，尽可能往前线输送军队所需要的东西。有一天，我到定州附近去看一个山洞，那洞里原先藏着一列车汽油，美军逃跑时拉不走，一把火烧了，火车都烧坏，堵住洞子。许多朝鲜战士点起一堆一堆的木柴照着亮，紧张地叫着号子，动手往外拉那些死车。柴火亮里，我看见一个朝鲜战士望着我笑。一个年青的小伙子，长的很壮，一张脸又红又圆，十分洒脱。我对他做着手势，他笑起来道：“同志，我也是从中国来的。”原来他叫朴石东，参加过中国的铁道兵团，今年才跟着一大队朝鲜同志过江回到祖国。他们从中国来，把中国人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意也带到朝鲜，走到那里就给老百姓挑水扫院，惹得一个八十多岁的老头奇怪地问道：“你们这是从那来的队伍呀？”
    当时朝鲜人民军正往南追击李承晚的伪军，朴石东他们这支铁道部队也追过汉城，一路紧急抢修铁路。在堤川抢修时，一间屋子存着十五桶汽油，美机投弹，屋子着了火，有个叫吴尚录的连长冲进火去，一个人把十五桶汽油都抢了出来，因此得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗勋章。这不是朝鲜铁道部队和铁路工人仅有的英雄事迹，但就这一点也可以看出朝鲜人民本身为了保证前线的胜利，怎样在后方进行着战斗。说到现时，朴石东用坚定的口气说：“现在我们得到中国志愿军的援助，解放了平壤；后方又有中国铁路援朝大队的帮助，我们一定能早日修复铁路，把美国鬼子早日消灭干净！”他忽然笑了笑说：“你知道，朝鲜老百姓都叫你们是哑叭军呢。”
    这个名词丝毫没有轻蔑的意思，倒有点不分彼此的亲昵意味。真的，自从到了朝鲜，我们简直像哑叭一样。可是不管遇见那个朝鲜人，言语虽然不通，他们总是用热情的眼睛望着我们。只要一有能翻译的人在旁边，彼此就要表达出自己的感情了。
    在宣川，一个叫桂玉吉的妇人披着条棉被，不停地摇着怀里的孩子说：“我丈夫原先在平壤内务省做事，一撤退，不知那去了。要不是中国志愿军帮助我们，我那有后路！今天见到你们，就像见到亲人。我也没有别的东西，只有一双袜子，送给你穿吧！”我们忍心而又感动地拒绝了她。
    又有一个深夜，朝鲜抢修大队的保卫部长廉得浩就地坐在席子上，轻轻说道：“想起头几个月我们撤出平壤，连夜往东北退，个个人低着脑袋，心想往那撤呢！有一天晚上走到熙川，月亮地里，忽然望见迎面开来一支部队，就近一看是中国志愿军，眼泪就掉下来了，话也不会说，抱着志愿军的脖子光是哭！”
    美国强盗害怕中朝人民的友谊，不断从飞机上向地面撒下无耻的挑拨性的传单。但有什么用呢？朝鲜人民是用一阵蔑视的大笑来谈论这些屁话的。在地理条件上，虽然有条鸭绿江把中朝人民隔在南北两岸，但在保卫自己祖国和世界和平的共同意志上，这条界线是不存在的。
