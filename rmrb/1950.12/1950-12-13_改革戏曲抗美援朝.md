Reform Opera to Resist America and Aid Korea

I.

Cultural Department Representative Li Zongyi

The long-awaited National Opera Work Conference for all opera workers nationwide was held on November 27, 1950, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. This conference can be said to be unprecedented in the history of the opera world. Reports from various regions show that the drama reform work after liberation has made rapid and good progress. Artists in feudal society were oppressed, insulted, and despised. Today, the People's Government respects and elevates art, and artists can be said to have turned over a new leaf. Artists have made ideological progress through learning, and have also made many creations. Business reforms are the harvest of ideological transformation. Opera workers and literary and art workers should exchange opinions, learn from each other, and unite to serve the people. Only in today's world, where the working people are the masters, are opera workers respected. We are determined to transform ourselves under the leadership of the People's Government, strive to create new operas needed by the people, use various opera forms to serve the people, and organize the national opera forces to express the heroic spirit of defending our homes and our country, and promote the excellent traditions of Chinese opera.

Cultural Department Representative Zhang Yunxi

I was transferred to the Central Visiting Group in August and went to the Northwest to work for three months. Having just returned from the Northwest, I participated in this revolutionary and united first National Opera Work Conference. I really feel honored. In the past, the reactionaries treated us opera workers as slaves and playthings. They did not allow our artists to unite, and used the artists' weaknesses of "making petty sectarianism" and "establishing their own households" to systematically divide us. The Peking Opera alone was divided into Neijiang, Waijiang, Guanwai and many other factions! This has harmed us for many years, causing us to discriminate against each other, unable to unite, and unknowingly acting as disseminators of poisons that paralyzed the people! Thinking back, it is infuriating!

The Chinese mainland has been liberated, the people have been liberated, and the artists have also improved their status, from slaves to masters, from playthings to literary and art workers. We have been liberated politically, spiritually, and in every way. How should we thank Chairman Mao? How should we repay the People's Government?

Under the clear guidance of the government, many artists across the country have entered study classes and have a better understanding of the new democratic society; they have more confidence. The drama reform movement has been widely launched in various places, striving to stage meaningful new operas, and the old operas that contain toxins are also gradually being disinfected. The government is also helping us to unite, so that representatives of opera work from all over the country can gather in the people's capital to hold meetings, sweeping away all the root causes of mutual discrimination, professional rivalry, non-cooperation, disunity, and so on that the ruling class left us; now it is mutual assistance, mutual teaching, friendship, cooperation, experience exchange, artistic exchange, and working together to serve the people. We are a huge literary and art force of 350,000 people, and our strength is immeasurable. In the upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and our country, every opera comrade must take up our respective weapons and fight against the mad American imperialists and the warmongers!

North China Representative Fu Shaofang

I sing Peking-style drum songs and write new drum lyrics in Tianjin to serve the people, but I don't know how far my work has progressed, because there is nowhere to compare and learn from. I am very excited to participate in the National Opera Work Conference this time. Not only did I meet representatives of opera artists from all over the country, but I also heard speeches from many leaders, pointing out the current tasks and future work guidelines; I also heard work reports from representatives from various provinces, cities, and regions, which made me understand the actual situation of the development of new opera in various places. Therefore, I feel that my work in Tianjin for more than a year has been greatly insufficient, and I am ashamed. In the future, I am willing to strengthen the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea in my post, to fulfill my responsibility to defend world peace.

Northeast Representative Qin Youmei

In the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and our country, our national opera workers gathered in the capital to discuss their work and exchange experiences. This is unprecedented. I feel supremely honored and excited to participate in this conference. There are many of our old predecessors, advanced workers in folk art from all sides, and new literary and art comrades participating in this conference. This shows the great unity of our opera literary and art workers and demonstrates our strength in resisting America and aiding Korea. In the past, artists were oppressed and humiliated by feudal forces, seeking perfection at the expense of themselves, and swallowing their anger. Today, after the cultivation and education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, their political awareness has been generally improved, and they have realized that American imperialism is our mortal enemy and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. The people of Northeast China, who have lived a slave life under the iron hooves of the Japanese devils for fourteen years, have a sufficient understanding of the face of imperialism. The painful lessons of blood for fourteen years have made the people of Northeast China cherish today's victory even more, and aroused a fervent wave of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and our country.

In the process of the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and four-year War of Liberation, which eliminated Japanese fascism and defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Korean people have always fought side by side with us, sharing weal and woe. American imperialism is our common enemy. We should unite closely and drive away the American imperialists.

We opera workers should use our artistic weapons to fight back against the aggression of American imperialism. In Shenyang, more than 100 opera comrades have voluntarily signed up to go to the front to carry stretchers and慰劳军队. Similar calls have also been heard in Beijing and other places. This proves that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our artists have actively promoted patriotic enthusiasm and internationalism. We must resolutely implement the tasks given to us by the conference and carry out the spirit of the conference into practical work and practical struggle.

Northeast Representative Zhang Yunting

Since liberation, our theater has made preliminary achievements with the help of the government, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and other parties. The theater has been reorganized on a democratic basis, and political, cultural, and professional learning has become everyone's habit. For example, the person who learned the most culture learned more than 1,700 characters, and the person who learned the least learned more than 200 characters. Even the 57-year-old man recognized 900 characters. In the past two years, several new dramas have been compiled to cooperate with current affairs propaganda. Just in terms of performing new dramas, there have been 284 performances, accounting for 40% of all performances. The actors have generally improved their political understanding.

But this is only the beginning of progress. We must work hard on this basis, especially at present, to improve the political understanding of the general artists, so as to do a good job in the propaganda and support work for resisting America and aiding Korea.

1.  Strengthen learning - in addition to continuing cultural and professional learning, in political learning, we must especially learn the documents on resisting America and aiding Korea, read newspapers and discuss them every day, so that everyone recognizes the importance of resisting America and aiding Korea.
2.  Compile and perform dramas on resisting America and aiding Korea, and continue to perform in the square. And make other propaganda such as picture posters.
3.  Put on shows for those who actively participate in the Volunteer Army and write letters of condolence to the front line in Korea.

Our Rehe has been devastated by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits for many years. We can no longer allow the American imperialists to devastate us. We must work hard and, together with the people of the whole country, drive the American imperialists out of Korea and Taiwan.

VI.

North China Military Region Representative Guo Wenxue

At the National Opera Work Conference, after listening to the reports on opera work in various regions, I learned that there are as many as 89 kinds of operas in the country, and the number of organized professional artists is more than 350,000. They all sent their representatives to the glorious capital of the people to participate in the National Opera Work Conference. This is really a earth-shattering unprecedented event. Recalling our artists in the old society, no matter what kind of drama or ballad singer you were, you had no status and were the most oppressed and despised. Feudal society listed us in the lower nine classes. When Japanese imperialism and Kuomintang reactionaries ruled, those traitors, warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, and local bullies could insult us at will, simply not treating us as human beings!

Since the Communist Party liberated us from a life worse than cattle and horses, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct literary and art policy, we have turned over a new leaf in terms of personality. We not only have social status, but also become people's literary and art workers and have received the help and love of the People's Government. Just as our opera circles and the people of the whole country are united in building our new country, American imperialism, under the false banner of the "United Nations," is invading our Taiwan, interfering with my liberation of Tibet, invading our fraternal neighbor Korea, and has hundreds of times used aircraft to invade our airspace, killing my brothers and sisters, dreaming of destroying China through Korea and dominating the world. The flames of imperialist aggression have burned to our doorsteps. We must not turn a blind eye. Our People's Volunteers have cooperated with the Korean fraternal troops to win many victories. Recently, the medical teams for resisting America and aiding Korea in Beijing and Tianjin have also spontaneously organized and set off. People from all walks of life across the country have been swept into the tide of resisting America and aiding Korea. Our opera circles can no longer lag behind. We must use our practical actions to launch the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. We resolutely support the declaration of the opera reform conference, organize charity performances everywhere, use the money earned from charity performances to comfort our volunteers, vigorously launch propaganda work, step up the rehearsal of operas for resisting America and aiding Korea, expose the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and write a large number of condolence letters to comfort the volunteer troops in Korea. Only by smashing the paper tiger of American imperialism with our artistic weapons can we live a peaceful life.

VII.

Southern Anhui Representative Wang Yuzhao

The National Opera Work Conference is a conference of historical significance in the Chinese opera world. This conference has further strengthened my understanding of the policy of "bringing forth the new from the old" and "serving the people." Drama is an art with great mass appeal and is closely related to the broad masses of the people. Old opera is a very valuable legacy of our nation. In the past, it was used by the feudal ruling class, so we must receive this legacy with a critical spirit and strengthen the reform of opera to make it serve the people well. Director Tian Han pointed out that in the future, the criterion for the review and selection of old operas must be whether it is beneficial or harmful to the people, as the standard for review, and not easily ban performances, which is completely correct.

Chinese opera has rich content and diverse forms. To complete the great task of opera revolution and implement the policy of "bringing forth the new from the old" is by no means an easy task. It must be a long-term, arduous task, and it cannot be done well by a few people. We must mobilize experts, opera reform workers, and the broad masses of opera artists to work together to complete this task of "bringing forth the new from the old." For this reason, the unity and education of artists is a fundamental issue in carrying out drama reform work. The reports of Director Tian and Deputy Director Ma further made us realize the importance of uniting artists and improving artists. We should continue to improve the ideological understanding and professional level of artists to promote the continued progress of drama reform work.

Director Tian and Deputy Director Yang clearly pointed out the writing direction of "adapting old scripts as the main focus and creating new ones as the auxiliary focus," calling on us to write a large number, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and gradually solve the problem of script shortage. Only by vigorously adapting old scripts can we absorb the essence of this valuable legacy and achieve the purpose of "bringing forth the new from the old"; only by serving reality, especially serving "resisting America and aiding Korea" at present, can our drama reform work be lively, vivid, and welcomed and accepted by the masses. Our drama reform work will have life and receive rapid progress.

VIII.

Henan Artist Representative Zhang Hongpan

Most of us artists lost our fathers at an early age, were propertyless and unemployed, or came from beggars and poor families. At that time, there was no way to make a living, so we joined the opera troupe to learn. The reactionaries thought we were inferior people and treated us like cattle and horses.

During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, our theater had 500 seats, but in reality, we only had income from more than 200 tickets. After selling the tickets, the difficulties came. The hooligans, gangsters, and reactionary troops not only did not buy tickets, but sat in the best seats. We begged them and said nice things, and sometimes we were beaten and scolded. If we didn't ask them to get up, we would lose credibility with the audience. The pseudo-Public Security Bureau ordered reserved seating, but it was not responsible for maintaining order, leaving us artists with no way to think. Our business was extremely sluggish, and the lives of the artists were very poor.

Hooligans and gangsters often came to the homes of female roles. If they were not entertained, they would be beaten and scolded, or they would make trouble for no reason, beat the theater, and throw bombs to intimidate the artists. They usually sat and lay down in the backstage at will, teasing the female performers. We were angry but dared not speak out.

After liberation, our days of standing out came. There are no hooligans, gangsters, or unreasonable troops in the liberated areas. The political status of our artists has been unprecedentedly improved. We have become educators of the people and have participated in various meetings. The government actively leads us and helps us. I have been singing operas for decades and have never had the right to speak. Today, as representatives, we have full right to speak in various meetings. This time, the government invited me to participate in the national opera work conference, which moved me to tears. Looking back on the past, we unconsciously served the feudal bureaucrats and the like. I feel deeply ashamed. Sometimes I was dissatisfied with the rulers of the old society, but I didn't dare to resist. Since liberation, I have long made up my mind to actively cooperate with the cadres to engage in drama reform work, so that the revised scripts can meet the requirements of the times and be as reasonable as possible, so that they can be welcomed and heard by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and achieve the purpose of serving the people. Why do we do this? This is because Chairman Mao's great and wise leadership has inspired us. At the same time, we realize that this is a historical task and a bright road. Only by doing this is it right, otherwise it is wrong.

Secondly, I want to talk about resisting America and aiding Korea. As far as the opera world is concerned, although we cannot take guns and go to the Korean front to fight, the power of propaganda is great. We must take resisting America and aiding Korea as the necessary content of our performances, inspire the people's enthusiasm for patriotism and internationalism, and actively participate in the Volunteer Army and support the front. I believe that this propaganda force of 350,000 people, the fresh force of art, can play a high role. We support this movement, and we must take on this responsibility. We believe that the final victory will definitely belong to the people of China and Korea!

IX.

Xiang Opera Representative Xu Shaoqing

We came to Beijing from Changsha, more than 3,000 miles away, and saw the upsurge of "resisting America and aiding Korea, defending our homes and our country" along the way. I believe that the unreasonable provocations of American imperialism will definitely be defeated. Today, as long as the people of China and Korea and the people of the world unite closely, imperialism has nothing to fear; on the contrary, its provocations can only accelerate its own demise. I hope that our friends engaged in opera work can widely use our opera weapons and strive for the widespread and in-depth propaganda of "resisting America and aiding Korea, defending our homes and our country"!

X.

Fujian - Fuzhou Min Opera Representative Lin Fei

The American imperialists have frantically carried out a war of aggression in Korea, burning the flames of war to the border of our Northeast, seriously threatening our country's security.

We drama workers should give play to the performance of our drama art, launch drama propaganda work, strengthen the national people's understanding of American imperialist aggression, and support the struggle of the Korean people. China and Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and we cannot sit idly by. Our support for Korea is also to defend our homeland. We will definitely be able to defeat American imperialism and defend peace in Asia and the world.

XI.

Sichuan West District Chengdu City Sichuan Opera Representative Cai Rulei

The National Opera Work Conference is the first of its kind in the history of opera in our country. I feel very happy. Old opera grew up in the old society. It has its advantages and disadvantages. It contains strong feudal toxins, but it also has a popular side. Opera can play a big role in transforming people's thinking. In the old society, opera served the feudal rulers, distorting history to sing their praises and paralyzing the people's thinking. In the old society, the artists, especially the female artists, were ravaged beyond description. Now it's good, the whole mainland has been liberated. We have also been liberated. Our comrades in the opera world should put aside our differences and hold hands closely, unite under Chairman Mao's new literary and art policy, serve the motherland, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and turn our grief and resentment into action and strength to repay our government and the people. The central issue of this conference is to reform old opera, that is, to reform the drama, reform the people, and reform the system. Who should we rely on to make these three reforms? The main thing is to rely on ourselves. Therefore, we should work hard to improve our thinking, critically accept the old drama, take its essence and discard its dross, and gradually work hard, and we will receive results. But first of all, we need to transform ourselves. As for reforming people, I dare to boldly say that most artists are willing to make progress, and perhaps there are very few who take a wait-and-see attitude. We should all patiently educate and help them with class friendship. As for reforming the system, the old society has died, and all its unreasonable systems should be taken to the coffin. The new society's opera circles should establish a new system - a democratic system. Only in this way can we do a good job in business and improve everyone's lives.

XII.

Gui Opera Artist Jiang Jinkai

In the past, when the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek colluded to rule us, we could not buy a stone of rice with a month's salary. They completely deceived us and exploited us. When the American troops were in Guilin, every afternoon after getting drunk, they would get into jeeps and run rampant. When they saw women, regardless of their age, they would abduct them into the cars and insult them at will. We will never forget this shame. Their restaurants prohibit Chinese people from speaking Chinese, which is even more outrageous. Korea is our friendly neighbor. If the American imperialists invade it, it will be the first step in invading China. I hope that all my colleagues in the opera world will mobilize on the stage to expand the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and our country.

    改革戏曲抗美援朝
    一
    文化部代表  李宗义
    全国戏曲工作者，期待已久的戏曲工作大会已于一九五○年十一月二十七日在中央人民政府文化部的主持下举行了。这个大会在戏曲界的历史上可以说是空前的。各地区的汇报，说明解放后的剧改工作都有很快而且很好的进展。在封建社会里的艺人，是被压迫、被侮辱、被轻视的。今天的人民政府是尊重艺术提高艺术的，艺人在今天也可以说是人格翻身了，艺人经过学习思想都有了进步，也有了不少的创造，业务也有了改革，业务的改革是思想的改造的收获。戏曲工作者与文艺工作者应互相交换意见，互相学习，结合起来为人民服务。只有在劳动人民做主人的今天，戏曲工作者才被尊重。我们坚决的在人民政府领导下改造自己，努力创造人民所需要的新戏曲，用各种戏曲形式来为人民服务，更把全国戏曲的力量组织起来，表现保家卫国的英雄气概，发扬中国戏曲优秀的传统。
    二
    文化部代表  张云溪
    我从八月间调到中央访问团同到西北去，工作了三个月，刚由西北归来，就参加了这个革命的、团结的第一届全国戏曲工作会议，我真是觉得荣幸。过去反动派把我们戏曲工作者当奴隶，当玩物，他们不容我们艺人团结，利用艺人“闹小宗派”“自立门户”种种弱点，有计划的把我们弄得“四分五裂”。单是京剧就给分成内江、外江、关外许多派别！害得我们多少年来互相歧视，不能团结，无知无觉的给他们做了麻痹人民的毒素散布器！回想起来叫人愤慨！
    中国大陆解放了，人民翻身了，艺人也提高了地位，由奴隶变成主人；由玩物变成文艺工作人员，在政治上，精神上，一切都得到了解放。我们应该怎样来感谢毛主席；怎样来报答人民政府呢？
    在政府明确的指导下，全国的艺人很多都进讲习班学习，对新民主主义社会有了认识；更有了信心。剧改运动在各地普遍展开，争取着上演有意义的新戏曲，旧有的戏曲凡是含有毒素的也逐步的在消毒。政府更帮助我们团结，使全国各地的戏曲工作代表，齐集在人民首都举行会议，把过去统治阶级给我们留下的互相歧视，同行冤家，不合作、不团结，种种的病根都一扫而空；现在是互助、互教，友爱、合作，经验交流，艺术交流，同心同力地为人民服务。我们是一支三十五万人庞大的文艺部队，我们的力量是不可估计的，在抗美援朝保家卫国热潮中，我们每一个戏曲工作的同志，都要拿起我们各自的武器，和疯狂的美帝，和战争贩子们作斗争！
    三
    华北代表  富少舫
    我在天津市唱京音大鼓、编唱新鼓词，为人民服务，可是不知工作的进步程度到底如何，因为无处比较和学习。这次我参加全国戏曲工作会议，非常兴奋。我不但见着了全国戏曲艺人的代表，同时又听到了很多首长的讲话，指出了当前的任务和今后工作方针；又听到各省市各地区代表们的工作汇报，使我了解了各个地方新戏曲发展的实地情形，我因此感觉到我在天津市一年多工作中大大的不够，惭愧万分。今后愿在本岗位上，加强抗美援朝的宣传工作，以尽保卫世界和平之责。
    四
    东北代表  秦友梅
    在抗美援朝，保家卫国的伟大运动中，我全国戏曲工作者在首都相聚一堂，讨论自己的工作，交流经验，这是空前未有的事情。我参加了这个会议，感到无上的光荣和兴奋。参加这次会议的有我们许多老前辈，和来自各方的民间艺术的先进工作者们，还有我们新文艺的工作同志们。这表现了我们戏曲文艺工作者的大团结，显示了我们抗美援朝的力量。过去的艺人受着封建势力的压迫侮辱，委屈求全，忍气吞声。今天经过共产党和人民政府的培养教育，普遍提高了政治觉悟，认识了美帝国主义是我们的死敌，也是全世界人民的死敌。十四年来在日本鬼子的铁蹄下，过着奴隶生活的东北人民，对帝国主义的面目已有足够的认识，十四年惨痛的血的教训，使东北人民更珍重今天胜利的果实，激起了抗美援朝保家卫国的热烈的浪潮。
    在中国人民八年抗日战争、四年解放战争，消灭了日本法西斯和打垮蒋介石匪帮的过程中，朝鲜人民一直是同我们并肩作战，患难相共，美帝国主义又是我们共同的仇敌。我们应当紧紧的团结起来，打走美帝。
    我们戏曲工作者应该利用我们的艺术武器，来回击美帝的侵略。在沈阳，我们已有一百余名戏曲工作的同志们，自动报名，要求到前方抬担架、慰劳军队。在北京及各地也传来同样的呼声。这证明我们艺人在毛主席的英明领导下，都积极的发扬了爱国的热情和国际主义的精神。我们要坚决执行大会给予我们的任务，把大会的精神贯彻到实际工作中与实际斗争中去。
    五
    东北代表  张云亭
    我们剧院自解放到现在，经过政府、文联等方面的帮助，已有了初步的成绩。剧院已在民主的基础上改组了，政治、文化、业务的学习，已成为大家的习惯，如学文化最多的学了一千七百多字，最少的也学了二百多字，连五十七岁的老头也认了九百多字。两年中编了几个新剧，配合了时事宣传，单就演新戏一项，就有二百八十四场，占全部演出的百分之四十。演员在政治认识上是普遍提高了。
    但这只是进步的开始，我们要在这个基础上努力，特别在目前要提高一般艺人的政治认识，以便做好抗美援朝的宣传工作和支援工作。
    一、加强学习——除了继续文化、业务学习以外，在政治学习上特别要学习抗美援朝的文件，每天读报、讨论，使每一个人认识抗美援朝的重要性。
    二、编演抗美援朝的戏，并继续到广场演出。并作其他的宣传如画报等。
    三、给踊跃参加志愿军的演戏看，给朝鲜前方写慰问信。
    我们热河是经过多年日寇及国民党匪帮摧残的，我们再不能让美帝来摧残我们。我们要努力，和全国人民一起，把美帝从朝鲜、台湾赶出去。
    六
    华北军区代表  郭文学
    在全国戏曲工作会议上，听了各地区戏曲工作的汇报，我知道了全国的戏曲，共有八十九种之多，有组织的职业艺人的数量，达三十五万以上，都派了自己的代表，光荣的来到人民的首都，参加全国戏曲工作会议。这真是天翻地覆空前未有的大事。回忆我们艺人在旧社会里，无论你是那种戏剧、曲艺演员，都是没有地位的，也是最受压迫和最被轻视的。封建社会把我们列在下九流，日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治的时候，那些汉奸卖国贼、军阀、官僚、地主、恶霸可以随意的侮辱我们，简直拿我们不当人看！
    自从共产党把咱们从牛马不如的生活中解放出来，在毛主席的正确文艺方针的指导下，我们已从人格上翻了身，我们不但有了社会地位，而且成了人民的文艺工作者，得到了人民政府的帮助与爱护。正在咱们戏曲界与全国人民团结一致建设自己新国家的时候，美帝国主义打着“联合国”的假招牌，来侵略我们的台湾，干涉我解放西藏，侵略咱们骨肉相联的邻邦朝鲜，并数百次用飞机侵入我领空，打死我兄弟姐妹，幻想通过朝鲜来灭亡中国独霸世界。帝国主义侵略的火焰，已烧到我们的门口，我们绝不能置之不理，我们的人民志愿军已经配合着朝鲜的兄弟部队打了不少的胜仗。最近北京、天津的抗美援朝医疗队又自动的组织起来出发了，全国各界人民都卷入抗美援朝的浪潮里。我们戏曲界更不能落于人后，我们要用我们实际的行动，展开抗美援朝工作，我们坚决的拥护戏改会议的宣言，到处组织义演，用义演得来的钱，去慰劳我们的志愿军，大力的展开宣传工作，加紧排演抗美援朝的戏曲，揭露美帝的侵略野心，及大批的写慰问信去慰问在朝鲜的志愿部队，用我们的艺术武器，把纸老虎美帝国主义打碎，才能过太平日子。
    七
    皖南代表  王郁昭
    全国戏曲工作会议是中国戏曲界具有历史意义的会议。这个会议，使我进一步加强了对“推陈出新”“为人民服务”的方针的认识。戏剧是具有很大群众性的艺术，与广大人民有着密切的联系，旧的戏曲，是我们民族很宝贵的遗产，过去曾为封建统治阶级所利用过，因此我们必须以批判的精神，来接收这一批遗产，加强对戏曲的改革工作，使其很好的为人民服务。田汉局长在今后对旧戏曲的审定取舍方面，指出必须以对人民有利还是有害为原则，做为审定的标准，不轻易禁演，这是完全正确的。
    中国的戏曲，内容丰富，形式多样，要完成戏曲革命的伟大任务，贯彻“推陈出新”的方针。决不是一件容易的事情，必须是长期的、艰苦的，更不是少数人能够做好的。必须动员专家、戏改工作者及广大戏曲界的艺人朋友，一道来努力进行，方能完成这“推陈出新”的任务。为此对艺人的团结教育，是进行剧改工作的基本问题。会议中田局长马副局长的报告，进一步使我们认识了团结艺人提高艺人的重要性，我们应该继续提高艺人的思想认识与业务水平，以促进戏改工作的继续进展。
    田局长及杨副局长明确的指出了“改编旧剧本为主，创造新的为辅”的写作方向，号召我们大量写作，及时的交流经验，逐步解决剧本荒的问题。只有大力的改编旧剧本，才能吸取这宝贵遗产的精华，达到“推陈出新”的目的；只有为现实服务，在目前尤其是为“抗美援朝”服务，我们的戏改工作，才会生动、活泼，并为群众所欢迎接受，我们的戏改工作，才会有生命，并收到迅速进展的效果。
    八
    河南艺人代表  张鸿盘
    我们艺人，多数是自幼失怙无产无业的，或者是乞丐和贫苦出身的。当时谋生无门，就参加了科班学习。反动派认为我们是下贱人，拿我们当牛马。
    在国民党反动派统治时代，我们剧院有五百座位，实际上只有二百多票的收入。卖票之后，困难来了，流氓地痞和反动派的军队非但不买票，反而坐在最好的位子上。我们向他们哀求，说好话，有时还要挨打挨骂。若不请他们起来，对观众就失了信用。伪公安局既令对号入座，可是又不负责维持秩序，使我们艺人无法可想。我们的营业是萧条极了，艺人的生活也就非常穷苦。
    流氓地痞时常到坤角家中来走动，若是不招待他们，就要打骂，或者借故生端，打戏院，投掷炸弹威吓艺人。平日在后台随便坐卧，调戏坤伶，我们敢怒而不敢言。
    解放后，我们出头的日子来到了。解放区里没有流氓地痞，没有不讲理的军队，我们艺人政治地位空前提高了，作了人民的教育工作者，参加了各种会议，政府积极的领导我们帮助我们。我唱戏已经几十年了，从未得到发言权，今天我们当代表，在各个会议中都有了充分的发言权。这次全国性的戏曲工作会议，政府又请我来参加，使我感动得流泪。回想过去，我们不知不觉的为封建官僚等服务，我深深感到惭愧，有时对旧社会统治者不满意，但也不敢反抗。自从解放以后，我早已下了决心，要积极和干部同志通力合作，从事剧改工作。使改过的剧本，能合乎时代要求，要尽情尽理，使它为工、农、兵所喜见乐闻，达到为人民服务的目的。我们为什么要这样作呢？这是毛主席伟大英明的领导感召了我们，同时我们认清了这是一个历史的任务，是一条光明的大道，只有这样作才是对的，不然就错了。
    其次要谈到的是抗美援朝。就戏曲界来说，我们虽然不能拿枪杆上朝鲜前方作战，但是宣传力量是伟大的，要把抗美援朝作为我们演出的中必内容，激发人民爱国主义国际主义的热情，积极参加志愿军、生产支前。我相信这支三十五万人的宣传部队、艺术的生力军，是可以发挥出高度的作用的。我们拥护这一运动，我们要负起这一责任。我们相信最后的胜利一定属于中朝两国人民！
    九
    湘剧代表  徐绍清
    我们从三千多里外的长沙到北京来，一路看见“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的热潮。我相信一定会击败美帝国主义的无理挑衅。今天，只要我们中朝人民和全世界人民紧密地团结在一块，帝国主义是没有什么可以畏惧的；相反地，它的挑衅却只能加速它自己的灭亡。我希望我们从事戏曲工作的朋友们，能广泛使用我们的戏曲武器，为广泛深入的“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的宣传而努力！

    美帝疯狂地在朝鲜进行了侵略战争，把战火燃烧到我国东北边境，严重威胁我国的安全。
    我们戏剧工作者，应当发挥我们戏剧艺术的性能，展开戏剧宣传工作，加强全国人民对美帝侵略的认识，支援朝鲜人民的斗争。中国与朝鲜唇齿相关，不能坐视。我们支援朝鲜，也是保卫祖国领土。我们一定能够打垮美帝，保卫亚洲和世界的和平。

    全国戏曲工作会议，在我国戏曲史上还是第一次。我觉得非常高兴。旧剧生长在旧社会中，它本身有优点也有缺点。它含有浓厚的封建毒素，但也有人民性的一面。在改造人们的思想上，戏曲能够起很大的作用。旧社会中，戏曲为封建统治者服务，歪曲历史去给他们歌功颂德，麻痹人民的思想。旧社会的艺人们，尤其是女艺人们，被他们蹂躏得不堪言状。现在好罗，全国大陆都解放了。我们也解放了。我们戏曲界同志们，应该不分畛域亲密携起手来，团结在毛主席新文艺方针下，为祖国服务；为工农兵服务，把悲愤怨气化为行动和力量，来报答自己的政府和人民。这次大会的中心问题是改革旧戏曲，就是改剧、改人、改制，这三改靠谁来改呢？主要的还是要靠我们自己。所以我们应该努力学习提高思想，对旧剧进行批判的接受，取其精华去其糟粕，逐步努力，就会收到成绩。但首先需要改造我们自己。改人呢，我敢大胆的说一句，艺人大多数是愿意进步的，或许也有极少数抱观望态度，我们大家要以阶级友爱很耐烦的去教育他们、帮助他们。至于改制，旧社会已经死亡，它的一切不合理的制度也应该带到棺材里面去。新社会的戏曲界应该建立起新的制度——民主制度。这样才能搞好业务，大家的生活也能好转。

    过去美帝与蒋介石勾结在一起，统治着我们的时候，赚一个月的钱买不着一石米，他们完全是欺骗我们，剥削我们。美军在桂林时，每天下午吃醉酒后，就坐上吉普车，横冲直撞，见了妇女，不管老幼，掳上车去，随意侮辱，这种耻辱，我们永远不会忘记。他们的餐厅，禁止中国人讲中国话，更是岂有此理。朝鲜是我们的友邻，美帝来略侵他，就是侵略中国的第一步，希望全国戏曲界的同仁们在舞台上总动员，扩大抗美援朝，保家卫国的宣传。
