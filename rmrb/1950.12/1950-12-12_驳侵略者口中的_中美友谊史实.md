    Refuting the "Historical Facts of Sino-American Friendship" in the Mouths of Aggressors
    He Fang
    The U.S. imperialist aggressors, who are accustomed to reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, are once again engaging in deceptive propaganda as they try to justify their acts of aggression against China. War-mongers Dulles and Austin, in their shameless and lengthy speeches to the UN Political Committee and the Security Council at the end of last month, not only repeated their old tricks of quibbling about the invasion of Korea and Taiwan, but also told a lot of so-called "historical facts" about the "friendship between the Chinese and American peoples," trying to portray the U.S.'s aggression against China over the past century as "aid" to China and "maintaining the territorial and administrative integrity of China." It's as if China would have perished long ago without the "protection" of the U.S. aggressors. But is this really the case? On the contrary, the "historical facts" listed by Austin are precisely the record of crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors against the Chinese people. The Chinese people have long recognized this two-faced, frequently deceitful aggressor—U.S. imperialism—from their own experiences over generations.
    Austin calls the "Treaty of Wangxia," which the U.S. government forced China to sign in 1844, "maintaining the territorial and administrative integrity of China" and claims that this "has always been a major intention of U.S. policy." He listed John Hay's "Open Door Note" of 1899, the Root-Takahira Agreement of 1908, the U.S. note demanding "most-favored-nation" treatment in 1915, the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of 1917, the Washington Conference from 1921 to 1922, and the Stimson Doctrine of 1932, collectively calling them "expressions of the U.S. government's friendship toward the Chinese people." Finally, he stubbornly insisted that it was because the U.S. "helped" China and opposed Japanese expansion that the Pearl Harbor incident occurred. Dulles went further, saying that the Pearl Harbor incident was a result of the U.S.'s refusal to recognize the Wang Jingwei regime. After listing a large number of figures related to U.S. cultural aggression against China, he concluded that the relationship between the U.S. and China "is almost unparalleled in the world."
    Chairman Mao stated in his telegram to the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce on the 2nd that "U.S. imperialists have engaged in a great deal of deceptive propaganda toward the Chinese people, and all patriots should not believe these deceptive remarks." Austin's speeches are precisely one such deceptive propaganda, and Chinese patriots should not and will not be fooled by him. However, in order to expose Dulles and Austin's distortion of history and their deception of the Chinese, American, and world's people, we must clarify the truth of these historical facts.
    Let's start with the "Treaty of Wangxia" (according to Austin, the first "expression of the U.S. government's friendship toward the Chinese people").
    China began its path from an independent and autonomous nation to a semi-colonial state with the Opium War of 1840. Before that, U.S. merchants not only smuggled opium into China like British merchants, but later the U.S. government also supported Britain's aggressive Opium War. In 1842, after the Qing government was forced to sign the humiliating "Treaty of Nanjing" with Britain, the U.S. government became greedy and specifically proposed 40,000 U.S. dollars from Congress the following year as a fund for aggression against China. At the same time, Caleb Cushing was sent as a plenipotentiary minister to demand "most-favored-nation" treatment from China and to sign a treaty. At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Webster instructed Cushing: "You are to display the superior character, position, and power of the American people in a suitable manner. You may speak of the vastness of America, the breadth of its commerce, the strength of its navy..." "to establish a more friendly relationship between China and our country than with Britain." It also said: "You must use very determined words and a very assertive attitude to indicate that if the Chinese government gives the subjects and commercial conveniences of other countries more than it gives to Americans, then the U.S. government cannot treat the Chinese emperor with friendship and respect. I hope you will find a way to sign a Sino-American treaty like the Sino-British treaty, and if there is an opportunity, then sign a more complete and formal treaty than the Sino-British treaty."
    Cushing, carrying out this mission and using the presentation of credentials as a pretext, requested to go to Beijing to negotiate with the Qing government. After being blocked by the Qing court, he stayed in Guangdong and negotiated with the local authorities. During the negotiations, Cushing sent a note to Cheng Yu-cai, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi and Governor of Guangdong, threatening, "The government of this country may have to make the Chinese people taste the disaster of war again." Under this intimidation and deception, he forced the Qing government to sign the "Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia," which invaded China.
    The "Treaty of Wangxia" not only allowed the U.S. to obtain the same benefits and privileges in China as those granted to Britain by the "Treaty of Nanjing," but also added many contents not included in the "Treaty of Nanjing." The main ones were the provisions for "most-favored-nation" treatment (Article 2) and the acquisition of "consular jurisdiction" (Articles 11 and 15). Therefore, Cushing, in his report to the U.S. government, proudly listed sixteen more points in his treaty than in the British treaty. He said: "The U.S. has gained many benefits from these achievements of Britain. But conversely, the Treaty of Wangxia, because of these new provisions, has also given British commerce a great advantage. ... It can be seen that the progress made by each country's government to extend foreign commercial power into this vast empire is beneficial to everyone."
    This is how the first diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China were established. And the "Treaty of Wangxia," the first treaty signed between the two countries, seriously damaged China's independence and undermined China's sovereignty. The provision for "consular jurisdiction," which damaged China's sovereignty, was the U.S.'s first creation in invading China. It was later adopted by all the powers invading China. The U.S. enjoyed this privilege until the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. However, Austin says that this was to "maintain the territorial and administrative integrity of China." Such self-deception can only be uttered by imperialists like Austin.
    In order to further its aggression in the future, the U.S. aggressors specifically left a loophole in the "Treaty of Wangxia," which was Article 34 regarding treaty revision. The U.S. government used this point to continue its attack on China, and finally, taking advantage of the Qing government's demise, forced it to sign the "Sino-American Tianjin Treaty" of 1858.
    From 1850 onwards, the Chinese people launched the famous Taiping Rebellion to resist foreign aggressors and the corrupt rule of the domestic landlord class. This movement progressed rapidly and captured Nanjing in less than three years. At this time, the U.S. aggressors, on the one hand, had U.S. rogue Frederick Townsend Ward organize "foreign troops" in Shanghai to suppress the Taiping Rebellion and help the traitorous Qing government; on the other hand, they coerced this government, which was facing popular resistance and whose rule was in danger, to take advantage of its predicament to seize more rights. In 1853, the U.S. government sent McLane as a commissioner to China to conduct treaty revision negotiations with the Qing court. When McLane himself arrived in China, he realized that he could use the Qing government's difficulties to extract more benefits. Therefore, he petitioned the U.S. government to take consistent action with Britain. In 1857, Britain and France organized a joint army to invade China, and the U.S. government actively assisted Britain and France. At the time, the U.S. Secretary of State instructed the U.S. Minister to China, Reed, to "freely communicate with the British and French ministers and explain to the Chinese people that the President believes the allies' aims are just." When the British and French invading forces attacked Tianjin, the U.S. seized the opportunity to force the Qing government to sign the "Sino-American Tianjin Treaty." After Britain and France forced the Qing government to sign the "Tianjin Treaty," the U.S., under the pretext of "equal benefit," further added eight articles to the "Sino-American Tianjin Treaty," making the rights obtained by the U.S. even greater than those in the British and French treaties.
    The "Sino-American Tianjin Treaty" not only maintained all the privileges enjoyed by the U.S. as stipulated in the "Treaty of Wangxia," but also expanded and increased the U.S.'s privileges and interests in China. This included the expansion of "consular jurisdiction" and the acquisition of rights such as customs agreements, inland river navigation, inland travel, and freedom of missionary work. It particularly emphasized "most-favored-nation" treatment, so that the U.S. could share the benefits whenever any other power seized interests in China.
    This is the situation of the revision and amendment of the "Treaty of Wangxia." And China gradually moved toward a semi-colonial state due to this constant aggression, including that of the U.S. The truth of the "Treaty of Wangxia," which Austin called the first "expression of friendship toward the Chinese people," is exactly this.
    Next, let's take a look at the so-called "Open Door" policy, which has been highly praised by Austin and his ilk.
    The "Open Door" policy was originally a policy of aggression implemented by U.S. imperialism against China during a certain period, and this was caused by the historical conditions at the time. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, China's international status plummeted due to the Qing government's defeat in this war. As a result, the powers intensified their aggression against China, expanding and seizing leased territories and "spheres of influence." By the end of the 19th century, these "spheres of influence" had been largely delineated. At that time, the U.S. was busy extending its influence to Central and South America; second, it needed to clear the obstacles to its aggression against China. To this end, the U.S. annexed Hawaii in 1898 and started a war with Spain in 1899. As a result, in addition to occupying Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other places in Central America, it annexed the Philippines in Asia as a springboard for aggression against China. However, this also prevented the U.S. from promptly sharing leased territories and "spheres of influence" in China like other powers. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government adopted an "Open Door" policy to coordinate with other powers and jointly invade China.
    In September and November 1899, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, who had served as ambassador to the United Kingdom, sent so-called "Open Door" notes to six countries: Britain, Germany, Russia, Japan, Italy, and France. In this note, the U.S. government put forward three expectations to the countries, the general idea was: (1) Do not interfere with all treaty ports and all vested interests in all "spheres of influence" or leased territories in China; (2) China's current treaty tariff shall apply to all goods loaded and unloaded at ports in all "spheres of influence," regardless of which country they belong to; (3) No higher port tax shall be levied on foreign ships than on domestic ships in any port within this "sphere," and the freight rate for transporting foreign goods by railways laid, managed, and operated within this "sphere" shall not be higher than that of its own country. Moreover, except for the notes to Britain and Russia, the term "territorial integrity" was not mentioned at all to the other four countries.
    Judging from this note, the proposal of the "Open Door" policy was not aimed at safeguarding China's territorial integrity. It also openly stated that countries should "not interfere" with each other's "spheres of influence" and leased territories in China, but only requested "equal treatment" in "commerce and navigation" for the U.S. in all these "spheres of influence." At the same time, the note also agreed to the increase of these "spheres of influence" and leased territories, as can be seen from the British reply on December 6 of the same year. The reply stated: "My government intends to issue a declaration with the same meaning as your government hopes for regarding the leased territory of Weihaiwei, or the area acquired by other means, and all spheres of influence that the British government currently and will have..." And John Hay was very satisfied with replies of this kind and declared triumphantly that the U.S. believed that the countries' "commitment to this proposal is final and unchangeable." This means that the "spheres of influence" or leased territories of various countries in China can continue to expand. Does this have anything in common with "maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity"?
    Not only that, shortly after the "Open Door" policy, which was supposed to "maintain China's territorial and administrative integrity," was proposed, the U.S. government itself had already directly sent troops to invade China and demanded territory from China.
    In 1900, the U.S. launched a war of aggression against China together with the other seven countries, which was the so-called "Eight-Power Allied Forces" campaign. During the war, the U.S. invading army, together with the invading armies of other countries, entered China's capital, Beijing, and the extent of its burning, killing, and looting made the Chinese people never forget. As a result, the Qing court was forced to sign the more humiliating "Boxer Protocol," and the U.S. army was able to station troops in the Chinese mainland and even the capital. This is also considered "maintaining the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty," which is simply ridiculous!
    On March 20 of the same year, the U.S. sent the "Second Open Door Note of John Hay" to eight countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, and Belgium. This note differed from the previous one in that it made the "Open Door" applicable to "all places in China." The first note only required the powers to "open the door" to the U.S. within their "spheres of influence." This time, the entire China was to implement the "Open Door." Under the banner of the "Open Door," the U.S.'s aggression against China took another step forward.
    Of course, this note also mentioned "maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity," but this was just empty talk. The real content was that the U.S. used this empty talk to achieve the goal of seizing China's territory and sovereignty. Subsequent facts quickly proved this point.
    In December of the same year, the U.S. already wanted to occupy Sandu Ao (i.e., Sansha Bay) in Fujian Province as its naval base. John Hay said in a telegram to the U.S. Minister to Japan, Buck, on December 7: "The Navy is very eager to get Sansha Bay north of Fuzhou as a coaling station. Please inquire informally and carefully whether the Japanese government would object to us negotiating with China on this matter." This means that as long as Japan does not object, Sansha Bay will become the U.S. Navy's "coaling station." However, at that time, Fujian was Japan's sphere of influence, and Japan naturally would not agree. Therefore, on December 11, the Japanese Minister to the U.S. copied the instructions given to him by the Foreign Ministry to John Hay, formally rejecting the U.S.'s request.
    This happened five months after the U.S. reiterated its "Open Door" note on "maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity" to Britain, Russia, and other countries. Doesn't this expose the truth about the U.S. aggressors using the "Open Door" policy to conduct deceptive propaganda?
    U.S. reactionaries have always portrayed the "Open Door" policy as a moral policy to oppose the imperialist "carving up of China." In reality, this policy is an imperialist diplomatic means invented by the British and inherited by the U.S. Its purpose, as mentioned above, is entirely to protect imperialist aggression and plunder against China. Under this policy, the U.S. has always actively colluded with other imperialist countries to carry out the aggressive activity of "carving up China." As Professor Taylor said: "It was the Chinese themselves, not the Americans, who prevented China from being carved up. The Boxer Rebellion forced the Western countries to unite and jointly put down this anti-imperialist trend. At that time, they were about to carve up China. If the carving up continues, it will inevitably lead to war. They finally signed the Boxer Protocol, which stipulated the international co-management of China, rather than the exclusive monopoly of each country. The 'great significance' of the 'Open Door' is to replace the carving up with joint oppression. However, this change was not voluntary. The main reason is that everyone was afraid that similar anti-imperialist movements would happen again. At the same time, none of them had the strength to challenge all the other countries." In the years that followed, the U.S. further intensified its aggression against China under the guise of the "Open Door," and gradually eliminated the dominant position of other imperialist countries in China, breaking the balance of power among the imperialist countries jointly carving up China in a certain period. It tightly controlled the Kuomintang pawns and made the entire China its "sphere of influence," and the U.S. almost turned from one of the powers that invaded China to the exclusive owner of China. Only because of the resistance of the Chinese people was the U.S. imperialist dream of exclusive domination shattered.
    Even if we take a step back, the U.S.'s proposal of this "Open Door" policy and its dealings with the powers were neither agreed to by China, nor was China one of the parties involved. Yet, the U.S. arbitrarily exchanged official documents and dealt with Chinese issues, which in itself has already violated China's sovereignty. Not to mention that its content and implementation were originally aggressive against China. Therefore, for Austin and his ilk to regard the "Open Door" policy as an "expression of the U.S. government's friendship toward the Chinese people" is simply a great joke on history.
    In addition, Austin calls the Root-Takahira Agreement and the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, in which the U.S. and Japan reached a compromise and understanding on the invasion of China, "expressions of friendship toward the Chinese people," which will only arouse our anger even more. Because in the past few decades, Japan's aggression against China has almost always been carried out with the direct or indirect assistance of the U.S. The above-mentioned two agreements are precisely two examples of the U.S. encouraging and condoning Japan's invasion of China in order to profit from it.
    The U.S.'s ambition for Northeast China had long been in its sights. First, it helped Japan destroy Korea, and then it joined Japan in peeking into the Northeast. At that time, because Tsarist Russia had a great influence in the Northeast, the U.S. decided to support Japan to fight Russia, so that after Tsarist Russia was defeated, it could implement its plan to control the Northeast railway and invade China with Tsarist Russia, the Harriman Plan. It was only because of Japan's rapid breach of the treaty that this Harriman Plan failed to materialize. However, the U.S.'s ambition for the Northeast has not diminished at all, as evidenced by the subsequent Knox Plan.
    After the Russo-Japanese War, when Japan dominated South Manchuria and did not allow the U.S. to intervene, the contradictions between Japan and the U.S. in China were indeed revealed to the world. However, on the one hand, Japan defeated Tsarist Russia with the support of the U.S. At this time, its national power was limited, and it did not need to become an enemy of the U.S. immediately. On the other hand, the U.S. imperialists, who were accustomed to sitting back and reaping the benefits, still felt it necessary to use Japan to invade China and contain the powers. Moreover, the U.S.'s new expansion in the Pacific was not yet very secure. Therefore, as long as Japan guarantees the U.S.'s interests in the Pacific, guarantees the U.S.'s interests in China, and can even increase the U.S.'s interests in China when further invading China (such as later demanding to share the rights of the Twenty-One Demands), then the U.S. is happy to reach a compromise with Japan on the issue of invading China. The so-called Root-Takahira Agreement was produced under these circumstances.
    This agreement was originally proposed by then Japanese Prime Minister Taro Katsura, and later notified by Foreign Minister Komura to Ambassador to the U.S. Kogoro Takahira, and confirmed by the U.S. Secretary of State Root in the form of exchange of letters. The agreement has five articles, the content of which can be summarized into three points: First, eliminate the doubts of the two countries in the struggle for hegemony in the Pacific and determine the principles of commerce and trade in the Pacific; second, determine that the two countries will not invade each other's territories seized in the Pacific and China, in other words, the U.S. recognizes Japan's occupation of Taiwan, and Japan recognizes the U.S.'s occupation of the Philippines; third, stipulate that commercial and industrial opportunities in China are equal.
    This is clearly a compromise and understanding between Japan and the U.S. to invade China and the Pacific, which was proposed by Japan on its own initiative and later agreed to by the U.S. Can it be regarded as a "measure of friendship from the U.S. government toward the Chinese people"?
    In 1915, Japan, in view of the fact that the Western European powers were busy with the World War and had the above-mentioned understanding with the U.S., brazenly put forward the "Twenty-One Demands" to the Chinese government under Yuan Shikai in an attempt to subjugate China. The U.S. government appeared at this time in a posture of taking advantage of the situation. On May 15 of the same year, the U.S. State Department issued a note to both China and Japan, stating:
    "The U.S. government hereby declares that any provision in the treaty currently under negotiation, which is recognized by the Chinese government and changes the status of foreigners in China, the U.S. government will also enjoy its benefits under most-favored-nation treatment."
    This is the true content of what Austin said, "The U.S. opposes Japan's Twenty-One Demands" and "aids China"! It is best for these diplomats of the U.S. empire to flip through the archives before speaking. The era of making up stories to deceive people has long passed.
    In September 1917, Japan sent Kikujiro Ishii to the U.S. under the pretext of expressing gratitude to the U.S. (because the U.S. participated in the European War) to discuss an agreement on invading China. On November 2, the "Exchange of Notes between Japan and the U.S. Regarding China" was published in Washington, which is the famous Lansing-Ishii Agreement. This agreement clearly stated that the U.S. recognized Japan's special privileges in invading China, stating that "The U.S. government recognizes that the Japanese government has special interests in China, especially in the areas bordering the territories of Japan." Japan guarantees the interests obtained by the U.S. in China, recognizing its "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity" policies toward China.
    This is also considered by Austin to be a friendly measure to "help China" and "oppose Japan." People really cannot see any help that this provides to China. What they see is that the U.S. has obtained consent from Japan to infringe on China, and it generously helps (this is indeed helping) Japan to infringe on China! Therefore, without China knowing anything about it, the U.S., together with Japan and other countries, regards China as a colony of the powers and handles it arbitrarily. This is also considered "friendship toward the Chinese people"! These imperialist elements can actually say this out loud.
    Because of the understanding on the issue of invading China embodied in the Lansing-Ishii Agreement between the U.S. and Japan, the U.S. government not only disregarded some of China's legitimate demands at the later Paris Peace Conference, but also tried every means to make China recognize Japan's illegal demand to inherit the original German rights in China. China, as a victorious country, attended the peace conference and was treated as a defeated country. This was of course the result of the joint planning of the U.S., Britain, France, and Japan. This can be seen from the speech of the U.S. President at the four-nation conference held on the afternoon of April 22, which was attended by Chinese representatives.
    At this meeting, U.S. President Wilson and British Prime Minister successively spoke, the general idea being: "Regarding this issue (i.e., the Shandong issue), since China and Japan had signed agreements in 1915 and 1918, and in 1917, when Germany implemented its submarine strategy and the situation in Western Europe was tense, Britain, France, and other countries had to seek help from Japan and signed agreements with Japan, supporting Japan's various demands regarding Shandong and the Pacific islands north of the equator. The Sino-Japanese treaty is, of course, a matter between China and Japan and cannot bind other countries, but Britain and France cannot but abide by the treaties signed with Japan. Although he (the U.S. President) had proposed to hand over Jiaozhou Bay to the five major powers as a trust country, the Japanese government did not agree. In this situation, what should be asked now is, is China willing for Japan to inherit German rights according to the old Sino-German treaty? Or to exercise its rights in Shandong in accordance with the Sino-Japanese treaty?" In addition, the U.S. President also said: "The Shandong issue is bound by treaties by Britain, France, China, and Japan. It is really difficult to find a solution outside of the treaty." Here, the U.S. government not only recognizes the "Twenty-One Demands" as legal, but also tries its best to support Japan's demands, coercing China to accept them. Finally, it puts pressure on it, saying that it "hopes the Chinese representatives will consider it."
    Of course, there are contradictions between the U.S. and Japan in invading China and carrying out the sharing of spoils. But on the point of sacrificing China, the invaders showed consistency. This shameful activity of sacrificing China aroused unprecedented anger among the Chinese people and became the fuse of the "May Fourth Movement." The U.S. sometimes pretends to sympathize with China on the surface, but this is entirely to deceive the Chinese people, except for the fact that its aggressive interests conflict with Japan. Now, the aggressors are still using the fact that the U.S. helped China at the Paris Peace Conference to deceive, can this still make the Chinese people believe it?
    Austin used the examples of "the U.S. leading the Washington Conference, helping China solve the Shandong issue, and signing the Nine-Power Treaty" as "expressions of friendship toward the Chinese people." Then let's see who the Washington Conference was actually beneficial to.
    Due to the First World War and the success of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, international relations have undergone a very significant change. On the one hand, the world began to be divided into two camps: the socialist camp and the capitalist camp; on the other hand, the balance of power within the capitalist camp itself has also undergone a new combination. The Western European imperialist countries were either injured or weakened. Only the U.S. made a fortune in the war, so its economic power increased and its international status improved. Under these circumstances, in order to establish its hegemony in the Pacific and improve its position of aggression in China, the U.S. took the lead in convening the Washington Conference. Therefore, the Washington Conference was for the imperialists to solve the problem of expansion and aggression in the Pacific, especially against China, under the new balance of power.
    The Washington Conference stipulated the ratio of naval tonnage among Britain, the U.S., and Japan. The U.S.'s idea was that, according to this ratio, it would be difficult for Japan to be an enemy of the U.S., and it could also be used as a tool to oppose the revolutionized Soviet Union and invade China under the control of the U.S. At the same time, this conference also dismantled the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Because of these, the U.S.'s position in the Far East and the Pacific was further improved. And this is of course beneficial to U.S. imperialism.
    The discussion and decision on the China issue at the Washington Conference were also completely beneficial to the U.S. and other imperialists. Even the Chinese representatives' moderate demands (and many of these demands were assurances that were beneficial to the imperialists), were rejected by them. At that time, the so-called ten principles put forward by the Chinese representatives, including the request to gradually realize tariff autonomy, abolish consular jurisdiction and foreign post offices, and later the request to abolish Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" to China, were not only opposed by Japan, but also actively opposed by the U.S., and therefore all fell through. At the same time, aggressors such as the U.S. and Japan used this opportunity to attack China, deciding to establish a special committee to supervise tariffs, requiring China to abolish the Likin tax, and requiring the "Chinese government to declare on its own that it has no intention of making changes that hinder China's current tariff administration," that is, China's tariffs would still be controlled by them. As for the other demands made by the Chinese representatives, they were postponed indefinitely.
    Regarding the settlement of the Shandong issue, the U.S. not only did not help, but also made China suffer. It was only because of the opposition of the Chinese people that the warlord government at the time did not dare to agree to Japan's demands. At the same time, it forced the imperialists to take into account the strength of the Chinese people. Therefore, Japan gave up part of its original demands on the surface. During the Washington Conference, the U.S. government promoted direct negotiations between China and Japan, and it supported Japan from the sidelines. U.S. President Harding threatened in a conversation with the Chinese envoy: "If China does not accept the plan to resolve the Shandong issue, it may be in danger of losing the entire Shandong province." Under these circumstances, the decision to redeem the Jiaoji Railway in a different way, allow Japan to invest in mines such as Weifang, and compensate Japan at the actual price to recover the original German property, etc., came about. All of this clearly transferred the rights that China should have recovered to Japan in a circle. Austin and his ilk still stubbornly say that this was the U.S. government's assistance to the Chinese people. Isn't this really a matter of "who am I deceiving, am I deceiving Heaven?"
    As for the Nine-Power Treaty, it only established the U.S.'s "Open Door, Equal Opportunity" policy for invading China, and expanded its meaning and scope in a way that was beneficial to U.S. imperialist aggression. China did not get any benefit from the Nine-Power Treaty. In addition to the usual high-sounding words in the first two articles, "maintaining China's territorial and administrative integrity," as soon as it involves actual content, it is a provision to coordinate imperialist aggression against China, and makes the proportion of the U.S. in invading China higher than before.
    The essence of the Washington Conference and its decisions is just this. This is certainly not an "expression of the U.S. government's friendship toward the Chinese people."
    Austin and Dulles unanimously called the U.S. government's policy of sacrificing China and appeasing Japan during the "September 18th Incident" as assistance to the Chinese people, and cited Stimson's note, the so-called "non-recognition doctrine," to prove this point. The historical facts are naturally completely contrary to these deceptive teachings.
    During the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, Japanese imperialism quickly occupied the Northeast. What was the U.S.'s attitude at the time? It was just like its later appeasement of Hitler together with Britain and France in Western Europe, sacrificing Austria and Czechoslovakia, and guiding the fascist aggression towards the Soviet Union. In the Far East, it sacrificed China, allowing Japan to occupy the Northeast, in order to guide it north to attack the Soviet Union. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists, who were frightened by the great revolution of 1925 to 1927, felt that China, under the spiritual encouragement and material assistance of the Soviet Union, would not only get rid of Britain and Japan, but also get rid of the U.S.'s fetters. Therefore, the U.S. supported, or at least did not interfere with, Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, the so-called "non-recognition" is actually encouraging Japan to invade and deceiving the Chinese people.
    The "non-resistance" policy adopted by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government during the "September 18th Incident" was also promoted by the U.S. behind the scenes. For example, the memorandum left by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Forbes to Japanese Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara on November 27 stated that "the government of this country ... has advised the Chinese government to take compromise steps," which is clear evidence. When the League of Nations solicited the U.S.'s opinion on the "September 18th Incident," U.S. Secretary of State Stimson replied that "in order to avoid stimulating the emotions of the Japanese people, Japan should not be bound by treaties." Later, secret documents released by the State Department in 1946 also recorded that the U.S.'s attitude at the time was to "prevent international action against Japan from being too hasty" and "oppose the application of economic sanctions." In addition, after the "September 18th Incident," Stimson instructed Ambassador to the United Kingdom Dawes to attend the League of Nations, granting him full power to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue. Before leaving England, Dawes discussed with Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Tsuneo Matsudaira, and both agreed that the League of Nations' decision to set a deadline for Japan to withdraw its troops was an extremely stupid mistake. After arriving in Paris, Dawes defended Japan's aggression, saying that "in order to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, Japan's advance into Manchuria is justified and inevitable. Its meaning is the same as the dispatch of marines by other civilized countries." He cited the example of the U.S. sending General Pershing to lead 10,000 people into the Mexican city of Vera Cruz. At the same time, he demanded that the actual situation in Manchuria must be recognized, otherwise the Sino-Japanese issue could not be discussed.
    Only because Japan continued to advance south and did not go north, and at the same time to deceive public opinion, in January 1932, after Japan occupied Jinzhou, Stimson issued a note on the "non-recognition doctrine" to both China and Japan. Moreover, the main concern was that Japan's infringement would affect the interests of the U.S., saying that the "U.S. government has no intention of recognizing" anything that "may harm the rights of the U.S. or its people in China." As for Japan's occupation of the Northeast, it was something it had agreed to. Therefore, the day after Stimson's note was issued, the U.S. State Department issued a supplementary declaration explaining: "(1) The U.S. has no intention of interfering with Japan's legitimate treaty rights in Manchuria; (2) It does not intend to interfere with any event solved by Japan, but this event must not violate U.S. rights...." This is the basic spirit of the "non-recognition doctrine" that U.S. imperialists are still boasting about today. What help does this have for China?
    Now, let's take a look at what Dulles, Austin and others said about the historical fact that after the "July 7th Incident," the U.S., for the sake of friendship with the Chinese people, did not hesitate to risk war and therefore offended Japan, resulting in the "Pearl Harbor Incident."
    As mentioned above, after the First World War, the U.S.'s consistent

    驳侵略者口中的“中美友谊史实”
    贺放
    惯于颠倒黑白、混淆是非的美帝国主义侵略者，在狡辩其侵略中国的行为时，又在进行欺骗宣传了。战争贩子杜勒斯与奥斯汀，上月底曾先后在联大政委会与安理会上发表了无耻的冗长演说，除了重复其诡辩侵略朝鲜及台湾的陈腔旧调之外，还讲了一大堆所谓“中美人民友谊”的“史实”，企图把百余年来美国对中国的侵略，说成是“援助”中国和“保持中国领土与行政的完整”，好象没有美国侵略者的“保护”，中国老早就已灭亡了。但是果真如此吗？恰巧相反，奥斯汀所列举的那些“史实”，正是美国侵略者对中国人民的罪行录。中国人民从历代的切身经验中，早已认清了这个口蜜腹剑、经常进行欺骗宣传的侵略者——美帝国主义。
    奥斯汀把一八四四年美国政府逼迫中国所签订的“中美望厦条约”，称做“保持中国的领土与行政的完整”，并且说这“一直是美国政策的一个主要意向”。他列举了一八九九年海约翰的“门户开放照会”，一九○八年的罗脱——高平协定，一九一五年美国要求“最惠国”待遇的照会，一九一七年的蓝辛——石井协定，一九二一年到二二年的华盛顿会议，一九三二年史汀生的不承认主义等，统名之曰“美国政府对中国人民的友谊表现”。最后还硬说是由于美国“帮助”中国、反对日本扩张，因而才引起了珍珠港事件。杜勒斯则进而说，珍珠港事件是由于美国不承认汪精卫政权的结果，并在罗列了一大堆美国对中国进行文化侵略的数字后总结说：中美之间的这种关系“几乎是举世无双的”。
    毛主席在二日复天津工商业联合会的电报中曾说道：美国帝国主义者对于中国人民做了很多的欺骗宣传，一切爱国者都不应相信这些欺骗言论”。奥斯汀们的这些演说，正是一次这样的欺骗宣传，中国的爱国者不应当而且也不会上他的当的。但为了揭穿杜勒斯、奥斯汀们对历史的歪曲和对中美以及全世界人民的欺骗，那么，我们就必须弄清楚这些历史事实的真象。
    先从“中美望厦条约”（按奥斯汀的话，就是第一次“美国政府对中国人民的友谊表现”）说起。
    中国从一个独立自主的国家走向半殖民地的道路，是从一八四○年鸦片战争开始的。在这之前，美国商人不仅同英国商人一样向中国偷运鸦片，而且在后来美国政府还支援了英国所进行的侵略性的鸦片战争。至一八四二年，满清政府被迫与英国签订了屈辱的“江宁条约”以后，美国政府就红了眼，特于翌年三月由国会提出四万元美金，作为侵略中国的活动费。同时派顾兴做全权公使，向中国要求“最惠国”待遇，订立条约。当时美国国务卿韦卜斯给顾兴的训令上曾说：“你要在适当的方式下摆出美国人的高等气派、地位和权力。你可以谈起美国的幅员之大，商业之广、海军之强……”“借以使中国与我国建立较英国更友善的关系。”又说：“你要用很有决心的词句、很肯定的态度表示：如果中国政府给其他国家的臣民特权和商业便利比较予美国人的多时，那么，美国政府就不可能以友谊和尊重来对待中国皇帝了。希望你设法和中国订立像中英条约一样的中美条约，如有机会，则订立一个较中英条约更完全更正规的条约。”
    顾兴带着这个任务，以呈递国书为名，要求到北京与满清政府谈判，后为清廷挡驾，遂留粤与地方当局交涉。在谈判过程中，顾兴曾照会两广总督兼广东巡抚程矞采，以威胁的口吻说，“本国政府或有使中国人民再尝战祸之必要。”在这种恐吓和欺骗之下，逼迫满清政府签订了侵略中国的“中美五口贸易章程”即“望厦条约”。
    “望厦条约”不仅使美国在中国得到了“江宁条约”所给予英国的同样利益和特权，而且还增加了为“江宁条约”所没有的许多内容。其中主要的要算“最惠国”待遇的规定（第二款）和“领事裁判权”的攫得（第十一及十五两款）。所以顾兴在向美国政府所做的报告中，曾万分得意地列举他所订的条约要比英国的条约多十六点。他说：“从英国的这些成就中，美国是得到了很多利益。但反过来，望厦条约因为有这些新的规定，也就给了英国商业以很大利益。……由此可见，每一国的政府，为使外国商业势力伸入这个广大帝国而达到的进展，是对于大家都有利的。”
    这就是中美之间最初建立邦交的情形。而这个为中美两国所订的第一个条约的“望厦条约”，就已严重地损害了中国的独立，破坏了中国的主权。其中有损中国主权的“领事裁判权”的规定，乃是美国侵华的首创，后来即为侵略中国的各列强所援用，美国享受这个特权也就一直到蒋介石统治崩溃时为止。然而，奥斯汀却说这是为了“保持中国领土与行政的完整”，这种自欺欺人之谈，也只有帝国主义者如奥斯汀之流才能讲出口来。
    美国侵略者为了以后更进一步的侵略，特在“望厦条约”上留下一个空子，这就是第三十四款关于改约的规定。美国政府就利用这点继续向中国进攻，终于趁满清政府危亡之际，逼迫着和它签订了一八五八年的“中美天津条约”。
    中国人民为了反抗外国侵略者及本国大地主阶级的腐败统治，从一八五○年起曾发动了有名的太平天国革命运动。这个运动进展神速，不足三年即已攻克南京。这时美国侵略者，一方面由美国流氓华尔在上海组织镇压太平天国的“洋兵”，帮助卖国的满清政府；另一方面则胁迫这个遭到人民反抗而统治已处险境的政府，以便乘人之危夺取更多权益。一八五三年，美政府派麦克兰为委员来华，与清廷进行修约谈判。及至麦氏本人抵华，因觉察到可利用满清政府的困难以榨取更多利益，所以就呈请美国政府，要求与英国采取一致行动。一八五七年，英法组织联军侵略中国，美国政府即对英法加以积极协助。当时美国务卿曾指令驻华公使雷德说：“可与英法公使自由来往，并且向中国人民说明，总统相信盟国的目的是正当的。”美国当英法侵略军进攻天津时，即乘机迫满清签订“中美天津条约”，及至英法逼迫满清订立了“天津条约”后，又在“利益均沾”的借口之下，进一步将“中美天津条约”续增八条，使美国所得权益较英法条约尤有过之。
    “中美天津条约”不仅保持了“望厦条约”所规定美国享受的一切特权，而且还使美国扩大与增加了在华的特权和利益。这就是“领事裁判权”的扩大，以及海关协定、内河航行、内地游历、自由传教等权益的获得。其中特别强调了“最惠国”待遇，使以后任何列强在中国攫得利益时，美国均可分享其成。
    这就是“望厦条约”修改与增订的情形。而中国也就由于遭到这种包括美国在内的不断侵略，遂逐渐地走向了半殖民地。被奥斯汀称做第一个“对中国人民的友谊表现”的“望厦条约”，其真相就是如此。
    其次，让我们再看看被奥斯汀之流高唱入云的所谓“门户开放”政策。
    “门户开放”政策，本来是美帝国主义在一定时期内对中国实行侵略的政策，这是由当时的历史条件所造成的。一八九四年中日甲午之战后，由于满清政府在这个战争中的失败，就使中国的国际地位一落千丈。于是，列强对中国的侵略更加紧了，纷纷扩充与抢夺租借地和“势力范围”。迨至十九世纪末，这种“势力范围”就已大体上划定了。美国当时一则正忙于向中南美洲伸展它的势力；二则还需要扫清侵略中国的路障。为此，美国在一八九八年并吞了夏威夷；一八九九年与西班牙发生了战争。结果除在中美洲侵占了古巴、波多黎各等地外，在亚洲则吞并了菲律宾，作为侵略中国的跳板。但是，也就因为这样，使美国没能及时在中国分到与其他列强一样的租借地和“势力范围”。在这种情况下，美国政府就采取了与其他列强协调，以共同侵略中国的“门户开放”政策。
    一八九九年九月与十一月，曾任驻英大使的美国务卿海约翰，分别向英、德、俄、日、意、法六国提出所谓中国“门户开放”的通牒。在这个通牒内，美政府向列国提出了三点期望，大意是：（一）不干涉在中国之所谓一切“势力范围”，或租借地中之一切条约港口及一切既得权益；（二）中国之现行条约税则，对一切“势力范围”内之口岸装卸之一切货物，无论属于何国均为适用；（三）此种“范围”内之任何口岸，对他国船舶不得课以较本国船舶为高之港税，又在该“范围”内敷设、管理及经营之铁路，运输他国货物之运费，不得较其本国为高。而且除对英俄两国的通牒外，对其他四国根本就未提到“领土完整”一词。
    由这项通牒看来，“门户开放”政策的提出，并不是以维护中国领土完整为号召的，它还公开表示各国彼此互“不干涉”他国在华的“势力范围”与租借地，而只是要求在所有这些“势力范围”内，美国有“通商与航海”的“平等待遇”而已。同时，这个通牒还同意这种“势力范围”与租借地的增加，这从同年十二月六日的英国复文中就可看出。该复文说：“我政府对于威海卫租借地，或以其他方法所取得之地域，以及英国政府现有及将来领有之一切势力范围，拟发一与贵政府所希望之同一意义的宣言……”而海约翰对诸如此类的答复非常满意，并得意洋洋地宣告，美国认为各国“对这项提议的承诺是最后的，无可移易的。”这就是说，各国在中国的“势力范围”或租借地还可以继续扩大。难道这与“保持中国领土与行政完整”有任何相同之点吗？
    不仅如此，就在这个“保持中国领土与行政完整”的“门户开放”政策提出不久，美国政府自己已在直接派兵侵略中国和向中国索取领土了。
    一九○○年，美国连同其他七国一起向中国发动了侵略战争，这就是所谓“八国联军”之役。在战争中，美国侵略军队和其他国家的侵略军队一起，打进了中国的首都北京，其烧杀掳掠的程度，使中国人民永世难忘。结果，逼迫清廷订立了更加屈辱的“辛丑条约”，而美国的军队也就得以驻扎中国内地以至首都了。这也算是“保持中国领土与主权的完整”，真是活见鬼！
    同年的三月二十日，美国曾向英、法、德、俄、意、葡、匈、比等八国发出“海约翰二次门户开放通牒”。这次通牒不同于上次的，就是使“门户开放”适用于“中国一切地方”。第一次通牒只是要各列强在其“势力范围”内向美国“门户开放”，这次则是要整个中国实行“门户开放”。美国在“门户开放”的旗子下，向中国的侵略又进了一步了。
    当然，这次通牒也谈到了“保持中国领土与行政的完整”，但这只是空话，真实的内容是美国利用这句空话以达到夺取中国领土与主权的目的，此后的事实很快证明了这点。
    就在同年十二月，美国已想侵占中国福建省的三都澳（即三沙湾）作为他的海军基地。海约翰十二月七日给美驻日公使巴克的电报上曾说道：“海军极欲得福州北面的三沙湾作为煤站。请非正式地、缜密地探听日本政府会不会反对我们以此事向中国交涉。”这就是说，只要日本不反对，三沙湾就变成美国海军的“煤站”了。然而，当时福建是日本的势力范围，日本自然不会答应，所以十二月十一日，日本驻美公使将外务省给他的训令抄给海约翰，正式拒绝了美国的要求。
    这件事是在美国向英俄等国重申其“保持中国领土与行政的完整”的“门户开放”照会之后的五个月发生的。这不是正暴露了美国侵略者利用“门户开放”政策进行欺骗宣传的真相了吗？
    美国反动派向来把“门户开放”政策描写成为反对各帝国主义“瓜分中国”的道义政策，实际上，这个政策乃是英国人发明而为美国继承的一种帝国主义的外交手段。它的宗旨如上面所说的，完全是为了保护帝国主义对中国的侵略与掠夺。美国在这个政策之下，历来是积极地伙同其他帝国主义国家进行了“瓜分中国”的侵略活动。正如泰勤教授所说：“阻止中国瓜分的是中国人自己而非美国人。义和团事变迫使西方各国不得不联合起来共同扑灭这个反帝风潮。当时，他们正快要瓜分中国。瓜分再继续进行，必然引起战争，他们终于签订了辛丑条约，其中规定了国际共管中国，而非各国独自垄断。‘门户开放’的‘伟大意义’就是以联合压迫代替了瓜分。不过这种改变并非自愿的，主要的是大家怕这类反帝运动再会发生，同时，他们中间谁也没有力量来和其他一切国家挑战。”美国在此后许多年更进一步在“门户开放”的幌子下，加紧其对中国的侵略，并逐步排除其他帝国主义国家在中国的优势地位，打破了一定时期中各帝国主义共同瓜分中国的均势局面，而紧紧地控制了国民党走狗使整个中国变成了它的“势力范围”，而美国则从侵略中国的列强之一，几乎变成了中国的独占者。仅仅由于中国人民的反抗，美帝国主义的独占迷梦才被打碎了。
    即使退一步说，美国这种“门户开放”政策的提出及与列强间的来往和措置，既未得中国同意，中国又非当事者之一，而美国竟擅自交换公文，处理中国问题，其本身就已侵害了中国的主权。更不用说它的内容和实施本来就是侵略中国的。所以奥斯汀之流，把“门户开放”政策当做“美国政府对中国人民友谊的表现”，简直是对历史所开的天大玩笑。
    此外，奥斯汀把美国与日本在侵略中国上取得妥协与谅解的罗脱——高平协定和蓝辛——石井协定，也称做是“对中国人民友谊的表现”，这就更加要引起我们的愤怒了。因为过去几十年日本对中国的侵略，几乎没有一次不是在美国的直接或间接协助之下进行的。上述两个协定也正是美国鼓励与纵容日本侵略中国使自己从中渔利的两个例子而已。
    美国对中国东北的野心，很早就已成竹在胸。首先是帮助日本灭亡了朝鲜，然后就与日本一起进窥东北。当时因帝俄在东北有很大的势力，所以美国就决定支援日本来打俄国，以便在帝俄败后，好在东北实行它控制东北铁路，进而入侵中国与帝俄的哈利曼计划。只是由于日本的迅速撕毁条约，这个哈利曼计划才未能实现。然而，美国对东北的野心却并未因此稍减，后来的诺克斯计划就证明了这一点。
    当日俄战后，日本霸占了南满且不容美国插足时，日美在中国的矛盾确曾显露于世。然而，一方面日本系在美国支持下打败帝俄的，这时国力有限，且不必立即与美为敌；另一方面，惯于坐收渔利的美帝国主义，还觉得有利用日本侵略中国和牵制列强的必要，而且美国在太平洋上的新扩张还不十分安全。因此，只要日本保证美国在太平洋的利益，保证美国在中国的利益，甚至在进一步侵略中国时还可增加美国在中国的利益（如后来要求分享二十一条的权益等），那么，美国是乐于和日本在侵华问题上取得妥协的。所谓罗脱——高平协定，就是在这种情况下产生的。
    这个协定原为日本当时首相桂太郎所提议，后经外相小村通告驻美大使高平小五郎，与美国务卿罗脱以换文方式确定的。协定共五条，其内容可归纳为三点：第一，消除两国在太平洋争霸的疑虑，确定太平洋的通商与贸易原则；第二，确定两国在太平洋及中国所抢得之领土互不侵犯，换言之，即美国承认日占台湾，而日则承认美占菲律宾；第三，规定在中国之商工业机会均等。
    这分明是由日本主动提出，后经美国同意的一个侵略中国与太平洋的妥协与谅解，也能算做“美国政府对中国人民的友谊”措施吗？
    一九一五年，日本鉴于西欧各列强正忙于世界大战，而与美国又有上述的谅解，故悍然向中国袁世凯政府提出了亡华的“二十一条件”。美国政府在这时是以趁火打劫的姿态出现的。同年五月十五日，美国务院向中日两国发出照会，内称：
    “美国政府兹特声明，现在交涉中之条约，其中任何条款经中国政府承认，而对在华外人之地位有所变更者，在最惠国待遇下，美国政府亦将享有其利益。”
    这就是奥斯汀所说的，“美国反对日本的二十一条”而“援助中国”的真正内容！美帝的这一批外交家，在说话以前最好还是去翻一翻档案；这种信口开河来骗人的时代，早已过去了。
    一九一七年九月，日本派石井菊次郎以向美国致谢（因美参加欧战）为名，赴美商谈侵略中国的协议。至十一月二日，在华盛顿发表了“关于中国之日美交换公文”，即有名的蓝辛——石井协定。在这个协定上明确载有美国承认日本有侵略中国之特权，文曰“美国政府承认日本国在中国有特殊利益，接壤日本所领之地方尤然。”而日本则保证美国在华所获得之利益，承认其对中国的“门户开放”与“机会均等”。
    这也是奥斯汀认为“帮助中国”“反对日本”的友谊措施。人们实在看不出这对中国有一点帮助的地方，而看出来的，则是美国既从日本那里得到的同意侵犯中国，而它自己又慷慨地帮助（这才真是帮助）日本侵犯中国！因此在中国丝毫不得悉的情形之下，与日本及其他国家把中国看成列强的殖民地而擅自处理，这也算做“对中国人民的友谊”！亏这些帝国主义分子能说得出口。
    由于美日体现于蓝辛——石井协定上的对侵华问题所取得的谅解，所以在后来的巴黎和会上，美国政府就不但无视中国的一些正当要求，而且还百般设法，使中国承认日本继承原德国在华权益的非法要求。作为战胜国而出席和会的中国，竟被以战败国视之，这当然是美英法日共同策划的结果。这从该年四月二十二日下午所召开，并有中国代表出席的四国会议上美总统的发言就可看出。
    在这个会上，美总统威尔逊与英首相先后发言，大意说：“关于此问题（即山东问题），一九一五年及一九一八年中日二国既有成约订定，而一九一七年间，当德国厉行潜艇战略，欧西形势紧张，不得不求助于日本之际，英法等国并与日本订约，赞成日本关于山东及赤道以北太平洋岛屿之各项要求。中日条约，固为中日二国间之事，不能拘束别国，但英法与日本所订各约，英法自不能不遵守。彼（美总统）虽曾提议将胶州湾交与五大国作为承托国，而日本政府不允。照此情形，现在所当问明者，即中国情愿日本按照中德旧约，继承德国权益耶？抑按照中日条约在山东行使其权利耶？”此外，美总统还发言说：“山东问题，英法中日等国均受条约束缚，舍条约而别求解决之方，则实觉困难。”在这里，美国政府不但承认“二十一条件”为合法，而且还尽力支持日本的要求，威迫中国加以接受，最后并施以压力，说是“愿中国代表加以考虑”。
    当然，美日在侵略中国，进行分赃上，是有矛盾的。但在牺牲中国这一点上，却表现了侵略者们中间的一致。这种牺牲中国的可耻活动，曾激起中国人民的空前愤怒，而成为“五四运动”的导火线。美国有时在表面上也装成同情中国的样子，但这除了因为它的侵略利益与日本有矛盾之外，就完全是为了欺骗中国人民。现在侵略者还以美国在巴黎和会上帮助了中国为词进行欺骗，这难道还能使中国人民相信吗？
    奥斯汀以“美国领导了华盛顿会议，帮助中国解决了山东问题和签订了九国公约”为例，说这也是“对中国人民的友谊表现”。那么我们就看看华盛顿会议究竟对谁有利吧。
    由于第一次世界大战和苏联十月社会主义革命的成功，国际关系已发生了一个非常巨大的变化。一方面是世界开始分成了两个阵营——社会主义阵营与资本主义阵营；另一方面是资本主义阵营本身的力量对比也来了一次新的结合，西欧各帝国主义国家或则受伤，或则削弱。只有美国在战争中发了财，因而它的经济力量增强了，国际地位提高了。在这种情况下，美帝国主义为了建立它在太平洋的霸权和提高它在中国的侵略地位，于是出头召集了华盛顿会议。所以，华盛顿会议是帝国主义解决在新的力量对比下对太平洋，特别是对中国的扩张与侵略问题的。
    在华盛顿会议上，规定了英、美、日三国海军吨位的比率。美国的意思是，根据这个比率，日本就很难与美国为敌，而且还可以在美国的控制下，作为反对革命了的苏联和侵略中国的工具。同时，这次会议又拆散了英日同盟。因为这些，就使美国在远东与太平洋的地位更加提高了。而这当然是对美帝国主义有利的事。
    华盛顿会议上对中国问题的讨论和决定，也是完全有利于美国及其他帝国主义者的，中国代表那样温和的要求（在这些要求中还有许多有利于帝国主义的保证），也都为他们所拒绝了。当时，中国代表所提的所谓十大原则，其中要求分期实现关税自主，废除领事裁判权和外国邮政，以及后来要求的废除日本对华“二十一条件”等。不光遭到日本反对，而且也遭到美国积极反对，因而全部落了空。同时，美日等侵略者又利用这个机会向中国进攻，决定成立监督关税的特别委员会，要求中国取消厘金，并要“中国政府自行声明，无意作妨害中国眼前关税行政的变更，”就是说，中国关税还得由他们掌握。至于中国代表所提的其他要求，则被无限期地拖延下去了。
    关于山东问题的解决，美国不但没有帮什么忙，而且还使中国吃了亏。只是由于中国人民的反对，使当时的军阀政府没敢答应日本的要求，同时也逼使帝国主义者不能不考虑到中国人民的力量，因而日本就在表面上放弃了它原来的一部分要求。在华盛顿会议期间，美国政府促使中日直接进行谈判，而它则从旁给日本以支持。美总统哈定在和中国公使的谈话中就曾威胁说：“如果中国不接受解决山东问题的方案，或将有丧失山东全省的危险。”在这种情况下，就来了个换汤不换药的赎回胶济铁路，准许日本在潍坊等矿山投资，以及按实价补偿日本以收回德国原有财产等的决定。所有这些，分明是把中国应收回的权益转一个圈子又交给了日本，而奥斯汀之流，至今还硬说是美国政府对中国人民的援助，这不真是“吾谁欺，欺天乎”的事情吗？
    至于《九国公约》，那只是确立美国侵华的“门户开放，机会均等”政策，并把它的意义和范围向有利于美帝侵略方面扩大而已。中国并没有从《九国公约》得到任何利益。该公约除了一二两项上有照例几句“保持中国领土与行政完整”的冠冕堂皇言词之外，其余一涉实际内容，便是协调帝国主义侵略中国的规定，而且使美国在侵略中国上的比重较前更提高了。
    华盛顿会议，及其决定的实质就是如此。这当然不是什么“美国政府对中国人民的友谊表现”。
    奥斯汀与杜勒斯一致把“九一八”时，美国政府牺牲中国、绥靖日本的政策，也称做对中国人民的帮助，并引证史汀生的照会，即所谓“不承认主义”来证明这一点。历史的事实自然又和这些欺骗的说教完全相反。
    一九三一年“九一八”事变，日本帝国主义迅速占领了东北。当时美国的态度怎样呢？那就正像他后来在西欧和英法一起对希特勒实行绥靖，牺牲奥地利与捷克，把法西斯的侵略锋芒导向苏联这一政策一样，在远东，它是牺牲中国，让日本占领了东北，以便导之北向进攻苏联。同时，被一九二五年到二七年大革命吓坏了的美帝国主义者，觉得中国在苏联的精神鼓舞与物资援助下，不但会摆脱英日，而且也会摆脱美国的羁绊。因此美国就扶植，起码是不干涉日本侵华。因而，所谓“不承认”，实际上是鼓励日本侵略、欺骗中国人民而已。
    “九一八”时，蒋介石卖国政府所采取的“不抵抗”政策也是美国的幕后活动所促成，例如十一月二十七日美驻日大使福白斯留交日外相币原的觉书，其中曾说到“本国政府……曾劝中国政府采取妥协步调”等语即其明证。当国联征询美国对“九一八”的意见时，美国务卿史汀生曾答以“为避免刺激日本国民情绪，不应以条约约束日本”。后来一九四六年，国务院发表的秘密文件中，也记载美国当时的态度是“阻止国际对日行动切勿操之过急”，且“反对施用经济制裁”。此外，史汀生于“九一八”后曾训令驻英大使道斯列席国联，授以解决中日问题的全权。道斯在离英前曾与日本驻英大使松平恒雄商谈，一致认为国联限期使日本撤兵的决定是愚不可及的错误。道斯抵巴黎后，即替日本的侵略辩护，说什么“为保护日侨生命财产的安全起见，日本在满洲的进兵是理所当然，不可避免的。其意义正与其他文明国家之派遣陆战队一样”。并以美国曾派潘兴将军带领一万人进入过墨西哥的维拉城为例。同时，他要求必须承认日本在满洲的实际情况，否则不能讨论中日问题。
    仅仅由于日本的继续南进而并不北上，同时为了欺骗舆论，一九三二年一月，在日本占领锦州后，史汀生才向中日两国发了一个“不承认主义”的照会，而且其中主要是怕日本侵犯到美国的利益，说凡“足以损及美国或其人民在华之权利”，“美政府均无意承认”。至于日本占领东北，那是它同意了的。所以在史汀生照会发出第二天，美国务院即发表补充宣言解释道：“（一）美国丝毫无意干涉日本在满洲之合法条约权利；（二）不拟过问日本任何解决事件，惟此项事件，不得破坏美国权利……。”这就是美帝国主义者至今尚在吹嘘的“不承认主义”的基本精神。这对中国究竟有什么帮助呢？
    现在，我们再看看杜勒斯、奥斯汀们所说的，从“七七”事变后，美国为了对中国人民的友谊，不惜冒战争的危险，并因此得罪了日本，爆发了“珍珠港事变”这一历史事实倒底是怎么回事。
    如上所述，第一次世界大战后，美国在远东的一贯政策是，绥靖日本，鼓励与支持其西进，以侵略中国和进攻苏联。这种政策一直继续到珍珠港被偷袭为止。只是由于日本不北进而南下了，直接打到了美国的头上，这时美帝国主义才被迫在太平洋上对日本进行战争。在这之前，虽然日本已侵占了大半个中国，但美国还是在支持日本，牺牲中国。
    一九三七年日本向中国发动全面进攻，乃是美国长期栽培与扶植的结果。抗日战争爆发之前，美国供给了日本大量的汽车、石油、废铁及其他军用物资，日本借以发动战争的全部钱财军火的半数以上，均系美国所供给的。一九三六年，单是运日的军需品即达一千五百万美金之多。及至战争开始之后，一方面，美国政府并未反对日本侵略，而只是“保持静观、沉默、忍耐态度”；另一方面，大量的军用物资还是在“现购”“自运”法案下，源源输入日本，一九三七年，美国对日输出的军用物资，占全部输出额的百分之五十八；一九三八年则增加为百分之六十七。而这年（一九三八年），日本自美输入的作战物资竟达全部消耗的百分之九十二。一九三八年十月，赫尔致日本照会上还公开声称：“美国政府尊重日本的利益，美国对日本的贸易关系不加任何限制。”连杜勒斯本人也供认，直到四一年，美国对日贸易较其对华贸易也高出三倍。此外，还帮助日本建设制铝与石油等战争工业，帮助改良技术。至于对中国，则在初期连同情的表示都没有，即使对其走狗蒋介石的帮助，也寥寥无几的，与苏联当时对中国抗战的帮助，简直是不能同日而语。
    但这还只是问题的一方面，问题的另一方面就是美国当时出卖中国的罪恶策动。一九四○年冬，美国经过其邮政部长乌卡及美利诺尔学院之乌尔歇主教等，与日本陆军省军务局之岩畔大佐及井川忠雄等进行秘密谈判，后来又变成日驻美大使野村与美国务卿赫尔以及美总统之间的谈判。到四一年四月，赫尔提出一个“日美谅解方案”，其中第三部分就是牺牲中国的计划。在这里，美国政府答应劝告“蒋政权”投降，促使蒋汪合流，并承认“满洲国”；同时要求日本军队撤离中国本土，不并吞中国。以此来调整美日在侵略中国上的某些分歧，并诱导日本去反苏而不要南进。后来美国总统还打算与近卫文麿在阿拉斯加会谈。这就是美国制造牺牲中国的东方“慕尼黑”阴谋的真相。这又有那一点是帮助中国的呢？
    但是，当时日本军国主义者的野心却并不以此为限。他们一定要实现“大东亚共荣圈”的梦，即是说要独霸亚洲与太平洋，特别是要拿下南洋以解决它的物资困难。同时它与德意又有同盟关系，觉得打败英美等国很有把握。因而出兵占领了越南，并于四一年底偷袭了珍珠港，掀起了太平洋战争。所以“珍珠港事件”乃是美国执行“搬起石头打自己脚”的“绥靖政策”的结果，并不是什么用于不承认汪精卫政权而引起的。这不正与英法等绥靖希特勒而终于使自己吃了亏的事情如出一辙吗？如果张伯伦、达拉第之流在后来竟说“慕尼黑”政策是对奥地利与捷克的友谊援助，那能有一个人相信吗？
    后来美帝国主义支持与操纵蒋介石政府，反对中国人民的解放事业，特别是日本投降后，囊括了国民党中国的一切主权，并出钱出枪（有时还出人）促使蒋介石打内战，屠杀了成百万中国人民。所有这些，都是人所共知的事情，这里不用详述了。难道这些也都能叫做“对中国人民的友谊表现”？
    现在，由于百余年的体验，中国人民已认清了美帝国主义这个口蜜腹剑的侵略者。当美国侵占台湾、轰炸东北、并驱兵威胁我国境的时候，战争贩子如杜勒斯、奥斯汀之流竟大谈其“中美人民的友谊”，其欺骗的伎俩与企图都是白费的。美国侵略中国的血的历史，是任何欺骗宣传也掩盖不了的。
