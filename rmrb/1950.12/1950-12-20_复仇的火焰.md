    Flames of Revenge
    By our correspondent Li Zhuang
    The young men of the infantry artillery company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are overcoming numerous difficulties and continuing to advance in the mountains of North Korea. The mountains are high and the snow is deep, the slopes are steep and the roads are slippery. The No. 4 mule broke its buttocks, and a machine gun broke its legs. There are so many dangerous roads that heavy weapons often have to be moved from the backs of animals to the shoulders of men.
    The winter night in Korea comes especially early. At 6:00 PM, it is already dark. The snow on the mountain tops reflects a grayish-white cold light. The distant mountains are as vast as a boundless ocean. Today is December 1st. More than a hundred miles away to the south, in those invisible mountains, our comrades are fighting a bloody battle with the Americans. The infantry artillery company must catch up as soon as possible to support our comrades who are fighting the enemy with light weapons.
    Yesterday, the enemy withdrew from this area, retreating more than a hundred li. According to the combat experience of the veteran soldiers, this is now considered a march. Instructor Zhang Zhong and a communicator are walking in front. Zhang Zhong is a very active young man of twenty-three years old. Although the mountains and rivers of Korea are very similar to those of his hometown, he still has a strong sense of novelty about every plant and tree in Korea. The superiors have repeatedly taught, "Cherish every mountain, every river, every plant, and every tree in Korea." Therefore, it is easy to understand that before he fights in Korea, he should first have a good look at the scenery of Korea.
    At 7:00 PM, the infantry artillery company took a long rest in Peng Hu Li (village), and both men and horses needed to eat something. The troops arrived at this small mountain village with only one independent house at the scheduled time. The house squatted on a sunny hillside, backed by a black pine forest. There was no crowing of chickens, no barking of dogs, as if the village did not exist in the world.
    Zhang Zhong led the communicator towards the independent house. The three interconnected rooms had their doors and windows wide open, and darkness crawled out of the house. Zhang Zhong stepped into the hall and shone his flashlight on the kang in the west room. He was immediately terrified and took a step back involuntarily. It turned out that there were three bloody corpses lying on the kang! At this time, he realized that his right foot was stepping on something soft. He looked down and saw another corpse!
    "Has there just been a battle here?" Based on his military intuition, the instructor instinctively pulled out his pistol, and the communicator also took the carbine off his shoulder.
    Besides the corpses, there was nothing else in the west room. Zhang Zhong turned around and went straight to the east room to search. The kang in the east room was cluttered and disorganized. Only a three- or four-foot-high wardrobe standing in the corner was still largely intact. The wardrobe was old, but it was trembling slightly at this time, and the seams were hissing.
    Zhang Zhong was sure that there was someone in the wardrobe. He immediately pointed his pistol and rushed to the kang. When he opened the wardrobe door, he was stunned again. It turned out that there was a child squatting inside. The child was wearing a white, filthy suit, trembling all over, and his two bloodshot eyes shot out terrifying and desperate ferocity. His face, which was white with a hint of green, looked very frightening.
    Seeing that he was an unarmed Korean child, Zhang Zhong's nerves suddenly relaxed, and he said kindly to the child: "Don't be afraid, we are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." The child continued to be stunned for a long time, and when he realized that the people standing in front of him were two very kind Chinese people, he suddenly burst into tears and threw himself into Zhang Zhong's arms. The child's weak and powerless crying explained everything.
    The instructor lit a candle. The communicator was busy blocking the windows. The company commander and the soldiers heard the crying and ran to the house one after another. In a short time, the doorway was surrounded by people.
    The child could speak broken Chinese and wrote fairly fluent Chinese characters. The instructor took out a pencil and paper and talked to the child while writing. Han, the company commander from a poor peasant family, paced back and forth in the hall. The instructor tried hard to calm the noisy people down.
    The child began to narrate this tragic story with pen and mouth.
    The child's name was Zhang De Ke (章德客), and he lived in a self-sufficient family.
    Yesterday at noon, the Americans destroyed this family. The Americans fought from the road a dozen li west of the village to the place fifty or sixty li north of Peng Hu Village, and after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began its counterattack, they immediately ran south all over the mountains and fields. The Korean people hid in more remote and deep mountains. Zhang De Ke's father originally wanted to escape early, but he could not bear to abandon the potatoes and grains at home. The harvest in North Korea was especially good this year. The potatoes were as big as bowls, and the grains were like foxtails. Since the implementation of land reform, the old man had never seen such abundant grain, and all this grain belonged to him. Zhang De Ke's uncle was invited to Peng Hu Village to help tidy everything up. The whole family was so busy that they didn't eat all day. Yesterday at noon, the Americans suddenly came to Peng Hu Village. Zhang De Ke hid in the potato cellar and listened tremblingly to the screams of his sister-in-law and sisters.
    At this point, the child stood up and said to the instructor, "Father – here."
    The instructors were led to a small clearing in front of the left side of the house. By the dim light of the flashlight, people saw Zhang De Ke's father lying in a pile of weeds covered by snow with his hands tied behind his back, his head rolling beside his body. Zhang De Ke's uncle lay with his hands and feet facing the sky, his body riddled with holes. Zhang De Ke's younger brother was only twelve years old, and his small head was shattered.
    People returned to the west room and observed this killing field in detail. Zhang De Ke's two sisters and one sister-in-law were lying on the kang. Their lower bodies were naked, bloody, and their breasts had stab wounds. Zhang De Ke's mother was lying in the hall. There was no blood on her body, and she may have been killed by a club. Based on various circumstances, it must have been the Americans who raped these three poor girls and young women. The old lady ran to rescue them and was first killed by the Americans. Then, the Americans stabbed to death the three who were raped.
    This was truly a family destroyed! The soldiers of the Volunteer Army were originally iron men who had been tempered through long struggles. But now, looking at these bloody corpses, looking at this orphan with a pale face and bloodshot eyes, many people unconsciously wiped their eyes. Who has no parents? Who has no wife? Faced with this unbearable scene, who can't grit their teeth? People from the old revolutionary base areas thought of the Japanese invaders' large-scale "mopping-up" operations, and people from the newly liberated areas thought of Chiang Kai-shek killing people and forcing people to death by seizing grain and conscripting soldiers. Compared with the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek, the Americans were even worse.
    The instructor said loudly to the soldiers: "Comrades! What is resisting America and aiding Korea! Resisting America and aiding Korea is to avenge this child! It is to avenge the suffering Korean people! It is to prevent the Peng Hu Village incident from happening on our sacred land north of the Yalu River!"
    The instructor broke the soldiers' silence, and all kinds of rough curses suddenly poured out: "I'll fuck his ancestors!"... Squad Leader Qi, with his sharp Sichuan voice, shouted: "What is American imperialism? Today I have seen it with my own eyes."
    At the instructor's suggestion, everyone went out to bury the corpses for the child. The child designated a piece of cemetery that belonged to his family. The weather was dry and cold at this time, and the dead grass made a harsh hissing sound, and the pine forest also made an angry roar. The child sobbed, and people silently and laboriously dug the frozen sandy soil mixed with stones. According to our Chinese customs, the dead should be buried as deeply as possible to show the respect of the living for them, but in this hasty battlefield, people can only do their best. As the soldiers gradually left the graveyard, the child was still adding large pieces of dry soil to the new grave shovel by shovel. The instructor heartlessly dragged the child into the house.
    No one was in the mood to eat. The news reported by the cook made everyone even more angry. He said: The boiling water can't be boiled. He found a pile of feces in the rice pot of this family, which was obviously done by the Americans. He said: In the past, when the Japanese "mopped up" the liberated areas, they often did this. The cooks were most annoyed by this... At this time, only the child was an exception. He greedily swallowed the hard and brittle Chinese biscuits that the soldiers took out. He hadn't eaten for more than a day.
    Two hours later, the team set off. The child grabbed the instructor and repeatedly said in broken Chinese: "I – you, fight go!" Obviously, this was a difficult matter. The child insisted on joining the army, and it was difficult to dissuade him in terms of reason and emotion. However, the infantry artillery company belonged to the special forces. How could such a weak Korean child participate in the special forces on the battlefield? The instructor pondered for a while and said to the child: "We are going to fight immediately. You wait at home, and we will catch a few Americans for you to see." The child seemed to fully understand the instructor's words. The tightly frowned eyebrows slowly relaxed, and a smile appeared on the bloodshot corners of his eyes. He immediately wrote on the instructor's notebook: "If you don't take me, I will go to the People's Army to find my brother."
    It turned out that Zhang De Ke was a military dependent, the younger brother of a soldier in the Korean People's Army. This new discovery further increased the soldiers' hatred for the American soldiers and their affection for this child. The already silent team boiled again. Someone said: "When we meet the Americans, we want them dead or alive!" Another person corrected and said: "We want them dead, and we also want them alive!" Now, the team could no longer stay, and people embarked on the journey with heavy hearts. Goodbye, poor child.
    The team continued to walk for three days. The snow was getting heavier and heavier, and the road was getting harder and harder. The instructor seemed to feel that the current political work was particularly easy to do; the few people who liked to say strange things became silent; people no longer thought that infantry artillery, rocket launchers, and anti-tank guns were a torture. New letters of determination were sent to the instructor one after another. Seven soldiers wrote blood letters: "Avenge the Korean children!"
    On the night of the fourth, the infantry artillery company participated in the battle southwest of Xiajieyuli (south of Changjin Lake). The animals and backpacks were completely placed behind the front line, and the soldiers carried all their weapons and inserted themselves behind the enemy lines. The artillery positions were set on a small hill near the enemy's position, and several artillery pieces were pointed at the enemy's mortar positions. The sky was pitch black, and snowflakes fell on the faces. The soldiers forgot the cold and fatigue, widened their eyes and stared at the enemy, and a flame of revenge that could not be extinguished burned in their hearts. Suddenly, several blood-red flashes of fire flashed on the enemy's artillery positions. They were firing at our infantry – our beloved comrades. At this time, several infantry artillery pieces roared at the same time, and the echoes of spring thunder reverberated in the valley. Fifteen minutes later, the enemy's artillery was completely silent; then, the sound of our charge horn rang out all over the sky. (Attached picture)

    复仇的火焰
    本报记者  李庄
    中国人民志愿军某部的步兵炮连的年青小伙子们，克服着重重困难，在北朝鲜的丛山中继续前进。山高雪大，坡陡路滑，第四号骡子跌破屁股，有一挺机枪摔破了脚，险路是这样多，重火器常常要从牲口身上移到人的肩上。
    朝鲜的冬夜来得特别早，下午六时，天已大黑了。山头的积雪泛出一片灰白的寒光，渺茫的远山就和漫无边际的海洋一样。今天是十二月一日，在一百多里以外的南方，在那看不见的群山之中，同志们正和美国人浴血苦斗。步兵炮连要及早赶上去，支援我们那些手执轻武器和敌人拚命的战友。
    昨天敌人从这一带撤退，一退百余里。照老战士们的战斗经验来说，现在算是旅次行军，指导员张忠和一个通讯员走在前面。张忠是个二十三岁的十分好动的青年，虽然朝鲜的山水和他故乡的山水十分相似，但他对于朝鲜的一草一木，仍有强烈的新奇之感。上级曾经屡次教导，“要爱护朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木”。那么，在他在朝鲜作战之前，先饱览一番朝鲜的景物，也就十分容易理解的了。
    下午七时，步兵炮连在彭湖里（村）大休息，人马都要吃些东西。部队按照预定的时刻，到达这个只有一座独立家屋的小山庄。家屋蹲在一个向阳的山坡上，背靠着一片黑松林。这里没有鸡鸣，没有犬吠，就好像世间并不存在这个村庄一样。
    张忠带着通讯员走向独立的家屋。三间互相通贯的房子，门窗洞开，黑暗从屋里爬出来。张忠跨进堂屋，用手电筒向西套间的炕上一照，立刻毛发耸然，不由自主地向后退了一步。原来炕上躺着三具血淋淋的尸体！这时，他发现自己的右脚踩在一个软绵绵的东西上，低头一看，又是一具死尸！
    “这里刚才打过仗么？”指导员凭着军人的直感的判断，下意识地拔出驳壳枪，通讯员也从肩上拿下卡宾枪。
    西套间除了死尸以外，再没有其他东西。张忠转过身来，直奔东套间搜索。东套间炕上杂乱无章，只有墙角竖着的一个三、四尺高的衣柜，大体上还算完好。衣柜已经老旧了，但它这时却微微颤动，木缝接合处嘶嘶地作响。
    张忠肯定柜中有人，立刻端着驳壳枪，抢到炕上。揭开柜门一看，不由得又是一怔。原来柜里蹲着一个孩子。孩子穿着一身白色的污秽不堪的衣服，浑身发抖，两只血红的眼睛射出恐怖而又绝望的凶光。他那一副白中透青的面孔，显得十分可怕。
    看见他是个没有武器的朝鲜孩子，张忠的神经顿时松弛下来，和蔼地对着孩子说：“不要怕，我们是中国人民志愿军。”孩子继续愣了半晌，发现面前站着的是两个非常善良的中国人，蓦然哇的一声，扑到张忠怀里。孩子的软弱无力的哭泣，把一切都说明白了。
    指导员点上一支洋烛。通讯员忙着堵塞窗户。连长、战士听到哭声，纷纷跑到家屋里来，一会，把门口围得水泄不通。
    孩子会说半通不通的中国话，写得一笔相当流利的汉字。指导员拿出铅笔和纸张，和孩子边写边谈，贫农出身的韩连长在堂屋里踱来踱去，指导员费了很大力气，使嘈杂的人们慢慢安静下来。
    孩子用笔和嘴，开始叙述这个悲惨的故事。
    这个孩子名叫章德客，生活在一个自给自足的家庭里。
    昨天中午，美国人毁灭了这个家庭。美国人从村西十几里的大路上打到彭湖村以北五、六十里的地方，而在中国人民志愿军开始反攻以后，立刻漫山遍野地向南跑。朝鲜人民纷纷躲入更加偏僻的深山中。章德客的父亲本想早日躲开，却又丢不下家里的马铃薯和谷子。今年北朝鲜的年景特别好，马铃薯有碗口大，谷子就像狗尾巴。实行土地改革以来，老人家从来没有看见到这么丰腴的粮食，而这些粮食都是他的。章德客的舅舅被请到彭湖村，帮助收拾一切。全家忙得一天没有吃饭。昨天中午，美国人突然来到彭湖村，章德客藏到马铃薯地窖里，战栗地听着嫂嫂、姐姐们呼救的喊声。
    谈到此处，孩子站起身来，对指导员说：“父亲——这里。”
    指导员们被引到房子左前方的小坪上。借着手电筒的微光，人们看见章德客的父亲双手反缚，躺在被雪掩盖着的乱草堆中，头颅滚在尸身旁边。章德客的舅舅手脚朝天，浑身被扎得稀烂。章德客的弟弟还只有十二岁，小小的头颅被击碎了。
    人们返回西套间，详细观察这个杀人场。炕上躺着章德客两个姐姐，一个嫂嫂。她们下部赤裸，血肉模糊，乳房上有刺刀戳的痕迹。堂屋内躺着章德客的母亲，浑身没有血迹，可能是被棍棒击毙的。根据各种情况判断，一定是美国人强奸这三个可怜的姑娘和少妇，老太太跑来救援，先被美国人击毙了。尔后，美国人又刺死了三个被侮辱者。
    这真是家破人亡啊！志愿军的这些战士们本来是久经斗争锻炼的铁汉子，但是，现在，看着这些血淋淋的尸身，看着这个苍白面孔血红眼睛的孤儿，许多人却不知不觉地擦起眼睛来了。谁无父母？谁无妻子？面对着这种不忍卒睹的情景，谁能不咬牙切齿呢？老根据地出身的人想起日寇的大“扫荡”，新解放区出身的人想起蒋介石杀死人逼死人的抢粮抓丁的情景，美国人和日本人、蒋介石比起来，真是有过之无不及。
    指导员高声对战士们说：“同志们！什么是抗美援朝啊！抗美援朝就是给这个孩子报仇！就是给受苦受难的朝鲜人民报仇！就是不让彭湖村的事情发生在鸭绿江以北我们神圣的国土上！”
    指导员打破了战士的沉默，各种粗犷的咒骂一下子涌出来了：“我日他祖宗！”………七班长尖着四川嗓子叫道：“啥子是美帝国主义，今天我是亲眼看到了。”
    经过指导员提议，大家出动，替孩子埋尸。孩子指定了属于他家的一块坟地。这时天气干冷，枯草发出刺耳的嘶声，松林也发出愤怒的吼声，孩子嘤嘤啜泣着，人们默默无言艰难地挖掘那夹着石块的冰冻的沙土。按照我们中国的习惯，死人应该尽量埋得深些，表示生者对他们的敬重，但在这时间匆促的战场上，人们只能聊尽心意了。当着战士们逐渐离开坟场的时候，孩子还在新坟上一铲一铲地加添大块的干土。指导员忍心地把孩子拖到房子里来。
    人们都无心吃饭。炊事班长报告的消息，更使大家火上添油。他说：开水烧不成了，他在这家的饭锅里发现一滩大粪，显然是美国人干的事。他说：过去日本人“扫荡”解放区，常常这么干，炊事班长们最恼火这一点………。这时候，只有孩子一人例外，他贪婪地吞食战士们拿出来的又硬又脆的中国饼干，他已经一天多没有吃饭了。
    两小时后，队伍出发。孩子拉住指导员，用生硬的中国话一再地说：“我——你们，打去！”显然，这是一件难事。孩子执意参军，于情于理都难劝阻。但是，步兵炮连属于特种兵，这么一个软弱无力的朝鲜孩子，怎么能在战场上参加特种兵呢？指导员沉吟一下，对孩子说：“我们立刻就要打仗了。你在家里等着，我们捉几个美国人让你看看吧。”孩子似乎完全领悟了指导员的话，紧皱的眉毛缓缓舒开，血红的眼角上露出一抹笑容，他立刻在指导员的本子上写道：“你们不带我，我到人民军找哥哥，就去。”
    原来章德客是个军属，是朝鲜人民军战士的弟弟。这种新的发现，更增加了战士们对于美国兵的憎恨，对于这个孩子的情谊。已归沉寂的队伍又沸腾起来。有人说：“碰上美国人，要死的不要活的！”另外又有人纠正地说：“我们要死的，也要活的！”现在，队伍再也不能停留了，人们怀着沉重的心情踏上征途。别了，可怜的孩子。
    队伍继续走了三天。雪越下越大，路越来越难走了。指导员似乎觉得，现在的政治工作特别好作；个别好讲怪话的人沉默起来；人们再不认为步兵炮、火箭筒、反坦克枪是一种折磨了。新的决心书一个接一个地送到指导员手里。有七个战士写了血书：“为朝鲜孩子报仇！”
    四日夜里，步兵炮连在下碣隅里（长津湖以南）西南参加了战斗。牲口和背包完全放在火线的后方，战士们扛着全部武器插入敌后。炮位设在离敌人阵地附近的一个小山上，几门炮一齐指向敌人的迫击炮阵地。天空一片漆黑，雪片落在脸上，战士们忘记了寒冷和疲劳，睁圆眼睛向敌人凝视，胸中燃烧着浇不熄扑不灭的复仇烈火。突然，敌人的炮兵阵地上闪出几朵血红的火光，他们正向着我们的步兵——亲爱的战友们开火。这时，几门步兵炮同时轰鸣，山谷中荡漾着恍若春雷的回响。十五分钟以后，敌炮完全缄默；接着，漫天盖地响起了我们的冲锋号的声音。（附图片）
