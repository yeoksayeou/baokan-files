The Chinese delegation has already given a very detailed report on the proceedings and achievements of the Second World Peace Congress, so I won't repeat them here. I would like to write down my thoughts on the Peace Congress for the reference of my compatriots.

Last year, the first World Peace Congress was held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. Thirty-nine representatives from various Chinese people's organizations attended, including myself. I personally witnessed the strong atmosphere of peace. After returning to China, I publicized it everywhere, letting peace-loving Chinese people know that although a third world war was possible, the peace camp led by the Soviet Union was very strong, and it would be very difficult for American imperialism to launch a third world war. This year, I again participated in the Second World Peace Congress and saw that the forces for peace were even stronger than last year and developing very rapidly. In Warsaw, I had private talks with several British and American representatives, who all said, "The majority of the British and American people do not want to fight for the invasion of other countries, and the people of France and Italy are even more opposed to aggressive war and more vehement. The British reactionary government's obstruction of the Second Peace Congress being held in Sheffield has not only aroused the dissatisfaction and protest of peace-loving people all over the world, but also aroused the anger and protest of the British people," and so on. From this, the people of the whole world know who wants peace and who wants war. In this way, the forces for peace are greater and will certainly develop faster. In my opinion, it is not only difficult for British and American imperialism to launch a third world war, but also less likely than last year. I say this with good reason. Please let me elaborate.

Last year, when the first Peace Congress was held, defending peace was only an abstract ideal, and there was no concrete way to do it. This year, when the second Peace Congress was held, more than 500 million people had signed the Stockholm Appeal, which was a great warning and threat to the warmongers. This is no longer an abstract ideal, but concrete defense work. In the Far East, this defense work has become even more concrete; the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side in Korea, beating the invading armies of American imperialism and its satellite countries to a pulp. This is promoting ideals with practical actions and giving American imperialism not only a warning and threat, but also a blow. This shows that peace must be won with strength. The greater the strength that is won, the more restrained the ambitions of imperialism will be.

Last year, when the first Peace Congress was held, the Chinese People's Liberation Army had just crossed the Yangtze River and only liberated Nanjing. The southern half of China had not yet been liberated. This year, when the second Peace Congress was held, the Chinese mainland, except for a small part of Tibet, had been completely liberated. The Central People's Government and the governments at all levels below it had been established one after another, and China and the Soviet Union had signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in February this year, making the two great nations permanently united and the heroic armed forces of the two countries permanently hand in hand. The 700 million people of the two countries, which is more than one-third of the world's total population, are all heroic and strong, and have constituted a force to support peace.

The Soviet Union is a bulwark for defending peace. Since the unity of China and the Soviet Union, together with the forces of the peace-loving people in the new democratic countries, capitalist countries, and colonies, the world peace camp is much stronger than the warmongers' camp. We must continue to expand this peace camp, isolate the warmongers, and prevent them from doing evil, while driving their troops fighting in Korea out.

The declaration of the Second World Peace Congress and the letter from the Peace Congress to the United Nations will have a considerable impact on the countries that signed the North Atlantic Treaty. Although the governments of these countries are very reactionary, their people are moved by the Peace Congress and know the conspiracies and lies of the warmongers, and they are increasingly disgusted with aggressive war. Those who gloat over the misfortune of others are in the minority. They will certainly put pressure on their reactionary governments from time to time, especially in Britain and France. If the French government does not respect public opinion and only obeys the orders of American imperialism, it is very likely to collapse. This time, the people of various capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and Italy protested one after another after hearing Truman's crazy remarks, and the British people's protests were particularly fierce, declaring that they would never fight China. They know that if they fight China, the Soviet Union will definitely participate, and Britain and France will bear the brunt, so they do not want to fight China. From this point of view, it can be seen that Chairman Mao's leadership is correct in first signing the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union. His foresight is admirable.

The heroic resistance of the Korean people in the past five months is the most concrete and effective way to stop aggressive war. Therefore, when the Korean female representative, Ms. Park Jeong-ae, spoke at the conference, she received a warm welcome from all the representatives. The degree of enthusiasm can be said to have reached its peak. From this point of view, the sympathy of the representatives of various countries is on the side of Korea. Everyone knows that American imperialism is invading Korea and using troops in Korea, but American imperialism insists that North Korea is invading South Korea. Therefore, the conference passed the definition of the word "aggression," saying that a country using troops in another country is called aggression. If the people of a country are dissatisfied with the government, they have the right to revolution and cannot be called aggression.

Last year, when the first Peace Congress was held, there was no precise organization; this year, the Standing Committee was changed to the World Peace Council, which is in distant opposition to the Security Council of the United Nations. Under the Council, there are seven subcommittees, with the Political Committee at its head. The purpose is to maintain the spirit of the United Nations Charter. This is because today's United Nations has become an instrument of American imperialism's aggression, so all its actions violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter and destroy the organization of the United Nations completely. The plan of the Peace Congress is to rebuild the United Nations that has been destroyed, and to lead the people of the world to embark on the path of peace by prohibiting the manufacture of atomic and germ weapons, prohibiting war propaganda, and implementing economic and cultural exchanges, and to turn this world into a beautiful world. This lofty thought and far-reaching goal will surely attract the people of all countries to the peace camp. The speech of the Soviet representative Ehrenburg can represent this attitude. From this point of view, the Peace Congress recognizes the legal status of the United Nations, but urges it to restore its original duties and not to continue to be a tool of American imperialism. This point is clearly pointed out in the letter to the United Nations.

Between socialist countries and new democratic countries, governments and governments work together, and people and people work together. Between new democratic countries and capitalist countries, although governments and governments are not united, people and people can work together. At the meeting of the Second Peace Congress, representatives from various countries gathered together like brothers, respecting and loving each other. Although their religious beliefs are different, their political opinions are different, their skin is black and white, and their social classes are different, they all have the same view on peace. This is the foundation for lasting world peace.

This time, there were as many as 80 countries attending the Peace Congress, and there were as many as 1,756 representatives, of which women accounted for more than a quarter (446 people). Most of them are members of the International Women's Federation and are more vehemently opposed to aggressive war than men. As daughters, they do not want their fathers to fight for aggression. As sisters, they do not want their brothers to participate in the war for aggression. As wives, they do not want their husbands to be cannon fodder for aggression. As mothers, they do not want their beloved sons to be killed for aggression. With these four qualifications, their opposition to aggressive war is a matter of course, and they are a great force for defending peace. Not only do women in Britain, France, Italy, and other countries scold the warmongers, but also women and young people in West Germany, which the warmongers want to use, are protesting there. They are willing to fight for justice, to fight against aggression, but they are not willing to fight for imperialism.

The front line of this Peace Congress is a united front. Eighty countries are standing on the same front line in terms of nationality. In terms of occupation and social status, it also constitutes a united front. Among the representatives are workers and farmers, teachers and students, engineers and scientists, lawyers and doctors, writers and poets, musicians and movie stars, politicians and soldiers. There are members of parliament and city councilors, news reporters and businessmen, leaders of international organizations and leaders of domestic organizations, religious figures and actors, officials and staff members. In a word, it can be said that all kinds of people are included, forming a strong united front. The warmongers cannot ignore this force.

The British reactionary government, following the instructions of American imperialism, refused to allow representatives of the Peace Congress to enter the country. This move raised a question among the people: "Why are the representatives of the Peace Congress not allowed to enter the country? Doesn't the government want peace?" In addition, this refusal gave the representatives of various countries the opportunity to travel to the democratic countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. In Warsaw, the capital of Poland, they personally saw that 75% of the city was destroyed by the Nazi German army. Near Krakow, the old capital of Poland, there was a large concentration camp. In this concentration camp, 2.5 million Jews were burned to death. The method of killing people was to transport the Jews from various countries in large trucks, tell them to take a bath first, and then drive them into a dark room, where they were killed with poison gas, and then they were burned. Four thousand people were burned every day. Sometimes the skin was peeled off first to make lampshades, and the fat on the body was made into soap. When the Chinese delegation visited the concentration camp, there were still as many as seven tons of women's hair in stock, and they couldn't help but shed tears. All the delegations who visited the place had the same feeling, which shows the cruelty of German fascism. However, the representatives of various countries thought carefully and realized that the crimes committed by the American army in Korea were no less cruel than those of German fascism, and even exceeded them. Several cities were completely reduced to ashes, and not even chickens or dogs were left alive. Old women were all killed, and young women were kidnapped to satisfy their bestial desires. This scene gave the representatives of various countries a very deep impression. They all felt that American fascism must be eliminated. At the same time, they also visited the Soviet Union and learned that the Soviet people were immersed in construction and neither preparing for war nor engaging in propaganda. The so-called Soviet Union's plan to attack the United States was a shameless lie.

The above nine points are enough to show that there is very little possibility for British and American imperialism to launch a third world war, unless the warmongers are driven to the point of madness because they have no way out. If they unfortunately take the risk of launching it, they will be digging their own graves.

There are two other points that may be worth mentioning here.

(1) Poland suffered the invasion of German fascism, and the deaths and injuries of the people and the loss of property were countless. China suffered the invasion of Japanese fascism, and the deaths and injuries of the people and the loss of property were no less than those of Poland, or perhaps even more. Now German and Japanese fascism have been eliminated and will never return, and new people's democratic countries have been established in China and Poland. A thriving atmosphere can be seen everywhere, and its future must be very bright. The Second Peace Congress, held in Warsaw, gave the Chinese delegation the opportunity to understand Poland. From then on, the people of the two countries will work together under the leadership of the great Soviet Union, and embark on the road of socialism in a planned and step-by-step manner.

An American named Roach spoke at the conference and strongly urged China to take the Yugoslavian route. This person was either bought by Tito or was arrogant. If China were to take the Yugoslavian route, it would be tantamount to sacrificing the entire China to American imperialism. Wouldn't the achievements of the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the three-year Civil War be equal to zero? How could we face our ancestors, how could we face our descendants, how could we face the heroic martyrs who sacrificed on the battlefield? If we were to do this, Chiang Kai-shek would not need to be expelled, and Taiwan would not need to be recovered. The so-called liberation would completely lose its meaning. I was originally one of the speakers of the Chinese delegation and had prepared a manuscript attacking American imperialism's aggression against China and criticizing the absurdity of Roach's speech. Later, after listening to the speeches of two American representatives, they themselves attacked American imperialism and scolded Roach even more thoroughly than I did. The entire audience was extremely moved and applauded continuously. Roach was not a member of the American delegation. He was there to cause trouble at the behest of others. But since the American delegation had spoken so thoroughly and scolded so fiercely, my original manuscript lost its effect, so I did not speak.

    我对二届世界和大的感想
    马寅初
    关于第二届世界保卫和平大会的经过情形以及大会的成就，中国代表团已有很详细的报告，兹不赘述。我在此地要把我对于和大的感想写出来，以供国人的参考。
    去年第一届世界保卫和平大会在捷克首都布拉格举行，中国各人民团体派代表三十九人出席，鄙人亦是代表之一，亲见和平空气之盛。回国之后，到处宣传，使爱好和平的中国人民知道第三次大战虽有可能，但以苏联为首的和平阵营非常强大，美帝欲发动第三次大战，困难很多。今年鄙人又参加了第二届世界和平大会，看出和平力量比去年益加强大，且发展甚速。在华沙时曾与几位英美代表作私人谈话，咸说：“英美人民大多数不愿为侵略他国而打仗，而法意两国的人民反对侵略战争者更多，且更激烈。英国反动政府之阻挠第二届和平大会在设菲尔德举行，不但引起全世界爱好和平的人民的不满与抗议，且惹起英国人民的愤怒与抗议”云云。从此全世界人民皆知谁要和平，谁要打仗。这样一来，和平的力量更大，且必发展得更快。据我看来，英美帝国主义欲发动第三次大战，不但有困难而且可能性比去年更少。我说这句话，不无相当理由。请申述之。
    去年举行第一届和平大会时，保卫和平只是一种抽象的理想，还没有具体的办法。今年举行第二届和平大会时，斯德哥尔摩宣言书上签名者，已在五万万以上，对于战争贩子们，当然是一种极大的警告与威胁。这已不是抽象的理想，乃是具体的保卫工作。在远东，这个保卫工作更加具体化；中国志愿军与朝鲜人民军在朝鲜并肩作战，把美帝及其仆从国家的侵略军队打得落花流水，是以实际行动来推动理想，对美帝不但予以警告与威胁，且予以打击。足见和平是要以力量争取的。争取的力量愈大，帝国主义的野心愈戢。
    去年举行第一届和大时，中国解放军刚刚渡过长江，只解放南京，南半个中国尚未解放。今年举行第二届和大时，中国大陆除西藏一小部分外已完全解放，中央人民政府以及以下各级政府已陆续成立，而中苏两国于今年二月间又订了友好互助同盟条约，使两个伟大的民族永久团结，两国英勇的武装力量永久携手。两国七万万的人民等于世界全体人民三分之一强，而且都英勇刚强，已构成了支持和平的力量。
    苏联为保卫和平的堡垒，自中苏两国团结以来，加以新民主主义国家、资本主义国家以及殖民地的爱好和平人民的力量，世界和平阵营，已比战争贩子们的阵营强得多了。我们要把这个和平阵营继续扩大，把战争贩子们孤立起来，使之不能为恶，一面把他们在朝鲜作战的军队打出去。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会的宣言以及和大致联合国书，这两个文件对于签订北大西洋公约的各国，不无相当影响。此等国家的政府，虽甚反动，但它们的人民受了和大的感动，知道了战争贩子们的阴谋与谎言，益加厌恶侵略战争，幸灾乐祸者究属少数。他们对于他们的反动政府，一定不时加以压力，尤以英法两国为然。法国政府如不尊崇民意而惟美帝之命是听，很有垮台之可能。此次各资本主义国家如英法意的人民，听了杜鲁门的疯狂发言之后，纷纷抗议，而英国人民的抗议尤为激烈，声明决不愿与中国打仗。他们知道若与中国打仗，苏联一定要参加，英国、法国首当其冲，故不愿与中国打仗。就此一点看，可知毛主席领导正确，先与苏联订友好互助同盟条约，他的先见之明，令人感佩。
    五个月来，朝鲜人民之英勇抗战，是制止侵略战争之最具体最有效的办法。所以朝鲜女代表朴正爱先生在大会上发言时，受全场代表热烈的欢迎。热烈的程度可以说达到顶点。从这点上看，各国代表的同情是在朝鲜一方面。大家明知美帝侵略朝鲜，在朝鲜用兵，但美帝硬说北朝鲜侵略南朝鲜。故大会通过侵略二字的定义，谓一国在他国用兵谓之侵略。本国人民对政府不满，有革命之权利，不得谓之侵略。
    去年举行第一届和大时，尚无精密的组织；今年则把常设委员会改为世界和平理事会，与联合国之安全理事会遥遥相对。在理事会之下，又设七个分委员会，以政治委员会居其首。目的在维持联合国宪章之精神。这是因为今日之联合国，已成为美帝之侵略工具，故一切行动都违反了联合国宪章之规定，把联合国的组织破坏无余。和大的计划，要把已经破坏的联合国重新建立起来，要以禁止原子、细菌武器的制造，禁止战争宣传，实行经济与文化交流等方法，来领导全世界的人民都走上和平的道路，把这个世界变为美丽的世界。这种崇高的思想远大的目标，定能吸引各国人民走向和平阵营。苏联代表爱伦堡之发言，可以代表这种态度。从这点上看，和大承认联合国之合法地位，但促它恢复原来的职责，不要继续做美帝的工具。这一点，在致联合国书中明白指出。
    在社会主义国家与新民主主义国家之间，政府与政府携手，人民与人民携手。在新民主主义国家与资本主义国家之间，政府与政府虽不团结，而人民与人民却能相互携手。在第二次和大的会场上，各国代表共聚一堂，好像兄弟一样，相敬相爱，虽宗教信仰不同，政治意见互异，皮肤黑白有别、社会阶层不一；而对于和平皆抱一致之见解，此乃世界持久和平之基础。
    这次出席和大的国家有八十个之多，而代表有一七五六人之多，其中妇女占总数四分之一强（四四六人）。她们大多数为国际妇联的会员，反对侵略战争，比男子更为激烈。为女儿者，不愿父亲为侵略去打仗，为姊妹者不愿兄弟为侵略去参战，为妻者更不愿丈夫为侵略去做炮灰，为母亲者更不愿亲爱的儿子为侵略被人杀死。有此四个资格，她们的反对侵略战争，是当然的事，他们是保卫和平的一个极大力量。不但英、法、意等国的妇女痛骂战争贩子们，即战争贩子们想利用的西德，其妇女与青年亦在那里抗议。他们愿意为正义而战，为反对侵略而战，但不愿为帝国主义而战。
    这次和大的阵线是统一战线。以国别论有八十个国家站在同一的战线上。以职业和社会上的身份而论，又构成一个统一战线。代表之中有工人和农民，有教师和学生，有工程师和科学家，有律师和医师，有作者和诗人，有音乐家和电影名星，有政治家和军人。有国会议员和市参议员，有新闻记者和商人，有国际团体领袖和国内团体领袖，有宗教家和演员，有官吏和职员，一言以蔽之，可谓各种人等，无所不包，构成一个坚强的统一战线。这个力量，战争贩子们不能忽视。
    英国反动政府，遵照美帝之指示，拒绝和大代表入境。这种举动在人民间，引起一个疑问：“为什么不准和大代表入境，难道政府不要和平吗？”加以这个拒绝，予各国代表以游历东欧各民主国家和苏联之机会。他们在波兰首都华沙亲见百分之七十五的城市被德纳粹军队破坏，在波兰旧都克拉科附近有一个很大的集中营，在这个集中营之内烧死犹太人二百五十万人。其杀人的方法，是先把犹太人从各国用大车运来，嘱他们先洗澡，洗澡后驱入暗室，把他们用毒气毒死，而后再把他们烧掉，每日烧掉四万人。有时先把皮剥掉，用以制灯罩，把身上的脂肪制成肥皂。中国代表团到集中营参观时仅积存的女子头发，尚有七吨之多，不禁涕泗旁堕。各国代表团到该处参观者无不有此同感，足见德国法西斯之残忍。但各国代表仔细一想，现在美军在朝鲜所犯的罪行，其残忍不亚于德国法西斯，甚至有过之无不及者。好几个城市，整个化为灰烬，鸡犬不留。把老妇一概杀死，把青年妇女掳去，以满足他们的兽欲。这种情景予各国代表们以一种极深刻的印象。都觉得美法西斯非消灭不可。同时他们亦到苏联游览，始知苏联人民埋头建设既不备战亦不宣传，所谓苏联要进攻美国是无耻的谎言。
    以上九点足以说明英美帝国主义欲发动第三次大战其可能性很少，除非战争贩子们，因走头无路，疯狂到了极点。倘不幸而冒险发动，是自掘坟墓。
    此外尚有二点不妨在此谈一谈。
    （一）波兰受德国法西斯的侵略，人民的死伤，财产的损失，无可计数。中国受日本法西斯的侵略，人民的死伤，与财产的损失，不亚于波兰或且过之。现在德日法西斯都消灭了，一去不复来，而新的人民民主国家已在中波两国建立起来了。蓬勃的气象，到处可以看得见，其前途一定非常光明。二届和大，在华沙举行，予中国代表团以了解波兰之机会。从此两国人民相互携手，在伟大的苏联领导之下，共同合作，有计划地有步骤地走上社会主义的道路。
    有一位美国人名罗奇者在大会上发言，力劝中国走南斯拉夫的路线。此人不是被铁托买通，就是狂妄。若中国要走南斯拉夫的路线，无异于把整个中国断送于美帝，则八年抗战三年内战所得的成果，不亦等于零吗？何以对祖先，何以对子孙，何以对战场上牺牲的阵亡英烈？若要这样做，蒋介石亦不必驱逐，台湾亦不必收回，所谓解放完全失掉了意义。鄙人原是中国代表团发言人之一，做好了一篇稿子，攻击美帝之侵略中国，批驳罗奇发言之荒谬。后听了二位美国代表的发言，他们自己攻击美帝，痛骂罗奇，比鄙人更彻底，全场听了异常感动，鼓掌之声连续不绝。罗奇不是美国代表团的一分子，是因受人之托而来捣乱的，但美国代表团既说得如此彻底，骂得如此厉害，鄙人之原稿失其作用，所以鄙人没有发言。
