    Beijing News Agency Report: The Beijing Military Cadre School Enrollment Committee convened a joint conference of municipal and private secondary schools on the morning of the 11th. Hou Junyan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau and member of the Municipal Enrollment Committee, conveyed information regarding the enrollment of various military cadre schools. A total of 400 people attended, including principals, heads of teaching, Youth League branch secretaries, student union chairpersons, labor union directors, and political teachers from private schools. Director Hou first explained the great significance of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council's decision to recruit young students and young workers to study at various military cadre schools. Regarding enrollment matters in the city, he said: Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Enrollment Committee, each school should form an "Recommendation Committee" composed of administrative, Party, Youth League branch, student union, and labor union units. The list of candidates should be submitted to the Municipal Enrollment Committee for approval. The city-wide enrollment work will be completed within this week, so the Recommendation Committees of each school should expedite the completion of the recommendation procedures. The task of the Recommendation Committee is to be responsible for the preliminary review of the age, education, and political conditions of the students applying, based on the requirements for students stipulated by the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and to have the designated hospital check the students' physical health. The preliminary approved list and the specific opinions of the Recommendation Committee should be submitted to the Municipal Enrollment Committee for final decision. He also emphasized: The recommendation work must be carried out on the basis of the students' conscious voluntariness, and no form of coercion should be used. Although the time is short, each school must still proceed with a serious and responsible attitude. After the Enrollment Committee approves, each school can use various forms to warmly send off the students who will participate in military cadre school studies.
