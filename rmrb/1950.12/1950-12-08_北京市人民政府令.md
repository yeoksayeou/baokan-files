Beijing Municipality Urban Area (including the suburbs) Domestic Dog Registration and Management Measures

Article 1: All dog owners in this city whose dogs are two months or older must apply for registration and obtain a dog tag from the outdoor dog disposal center or registration office in accordance with these measures.

Article 2: Dog owners applying for registration shall fill in the following items according to the prescribed form (registration form to be determined separately): (1) Owner's name, age, origin, occupation, and address. (2) Dog's breed, gender, color and characteristics, age, whether it has any diseases, and whether it is fierce or docile.

Article 3: After a dog is registered, each dog will receive one dog tag to be hung around its neck. The validity period is one year, after which a new application for renewal is required. A fee may be charged for the dog tag to cover the cost of materials. The amount will be determined by the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau and reported to the Municipal People's Government for record.

Article 4: All registered dogs shall be vaccinated against rabies at the same time. Subsequently, annual vaccinations shall be carried out once or twice a year, and a vaccination certificate will be issued. The vaccination dates will be announced from time to time.

Article 5: If a dog tag is lost or damaged, the owner should apply for cancellation and reissue a new tag, still paying the cost of materials. If the owner's address changes or the dog undergoes any changes, the outdoor dog disposal center should be notified for record.

Article 6: After the promulgation of these measures, all dogs scattered in the streets without registration tags or without owners leading them shall be regarded as stray dogs and shall be captured by the Municipal Outdoor Dog Disposal Center as soon as possible and sent to the center for disposal. However, registered and tagged dogs will also be captured if the owner arbitrarily lets them roam the streets, defecate anywhere, chase and bark, bite pedestrians, or obstruct traffic.

Article 7: Captured dogs shall be kept at the disposal center for three days. The owner may claim the dog within three days, but must humbly accept criticism and pay a daily feeding fee. If the dog is not registered or vaccinated, registration and vaccination shall be carried out in accordance with Articles 1 and 4 before the dog can be led away on a leash. Dogs not claimed within the time limit will be disposed of.

Article 8: Travelers carrying dogs into the city who stay for more than one month shall complete registration, tag issuance, and vaccination procedures in accordance with these measures.

Article 9: When a dog dies, the owner shall immediately report it to the outdoor dog disposal center and return the original dog tag for cancellation.

Article 10: Dogs shall not be taken into public places (such as theaters and parks) or onto public buses and streetcars.

Article 11: If a dog is fierce and poses a danger to people or animals, the owner shall strictly restrain it or muzzle it. If negligence causes injury to people or animals, the owner shall be liable for medical expenses and other damages.

Article 12: If a dog owner discovers that their dog is sick, they should seek prompt treatment. If rabies occurs, the outdoor dog disposal center shall be notified immediately to capture and kill the dog and cremate its body. If a person has been bitten by a rabid dog, the outdoor dog disposal center shall be notified immediately, who shall inform the Public Health Bureau to promptly send personnel to administer injections and disinfect.

Article 13: Violators of these measures may be subject to appropriate penalties by the Sanitation Engineering Bureau depending on the severity of the circumstances.

Article 14: Matters not covered by these measures shall be amended at any time.

Article 15: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.
