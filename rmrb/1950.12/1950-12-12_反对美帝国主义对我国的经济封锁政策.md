In his speech at the plenary session of the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations on November 18 regarding the twenty-year peace plan proposed by Trygve Lie, Vyshinsky solemnly pointed out: "Discriminatory policies in foreign trade are inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Such policies hinder the establishment of normal economic relations between countries, are not in the interests of countries, and are contrary to the fundamental task of promoting and strengthening international relations." He further pointed out, "Discriminatory policies in foreign trade are still being implemented... their implementation is expanding, especially by the United States and the United Kingdom." The actual situation correctly pointed out by Vyshinsky is most evident in the Far East in the recent intensification of U.S. imperialism's control over exports to China, and in the Dulles-Acheson talks, the U.S. imperialism's proposal to blockade the Chinese coast with its navy. This behavior is a manifestation of this "increasingly expanding scale."

The U.S. imperialist economic blockade against China did not begin today. It was already actively underway at the time of Shanghai's liberation.

As early as June 26th last year, the Taiwan bandit gang announced a blockade of all Chinese seaports. This was actually a conspiracy directed by U.S. imperialism. Who doesn't understand that the bandit gang's base is in Taiwan, and without the help of the imperialists, it would be impossible to implement a truly effective blockade of China's entire east coast. But when the bandit gang implemented a blockade of the new China's seaports, U.S. imperialism cunningly pretended to be "uninformed" and refused to express its opinion. Later, it used "studying whether the blockade is legal" to avoid directly expressing its attitude. In the meantime, it interspersed some smokescreens of "denial" and "protest." But facts speak louder than words. On December 17th, the U.S. State Department, citing the pretext of protecting the safety of the American people, formally issued a warning to American ships not to sail to Shanghai. The State Department stated: "The port of Shanghai and its waterways are a dangerous area, not suitable for navigation. American ships should not risk sailing to that place." However, under the condition of obtaining 100% profit, American captains—such as those of the Flying Clipper—disregarded the State Department's notice and loaded the materials needed by the new China and sailed to Shanghai. Thereupon, the U.S. State Department again warned on December 24th: "Any American shipowners who sail their ships to ports blockaded by the Kuomintang may lose their navigation permits." Isn't this obvious? Who is blockading the Chinese coast?

On March 12th of this year, long before the outbreak of the Korean War, but precisely at a time when U.S. imperialism was actively preparing to launch the war of aggression against Korea and actively provoking the new democratic countries, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, in a report, had already revealed that all exports of "strategic materials" must have export licenses, and the list of export commodities would be submitted to the Department of Commerce for verification.

The "strategic materials" that the United States regulates total more than 600 kinds, most of which are heavy machinery, machine tools, non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, steel products, transportation equipment, and liquid fuels. Later, U.S. imperialism constantly used new laws to restrict the export of various "strategic materials": for example, in May of this year, it promulgated a decree to tighten the control of exports of auto parts. Exports of batteries exceeding a value of one hundred U.S. dollars (approximately 20 batteries), brake parts exceeding a value of five hundred U.S. dollars, or brake fluid exceeding a value of one hundred U.S. dollars, all require application for approval from the Department of Commerce in Washington. In July, it implemented a ban on the export of 20-inch wide and 28-inch long tinplate (commonly known as full-size tinplate) to the Far East (including Hong Kong). Also, according to a statement by Mobil Oil Company, the U.S. State Department requested the company to temporarily completely stop shipping petroleum products to the new China.

On July 20th, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that effective at 8:00 PM that night, export licenses for U.S. goods destined for People's China would be revoked; holders of these licenses were required to immediately return the revoked licenses. Export goods for which licenses had been issued included rubber, petroleum, machinery, tires, and textiles. In late August, U.S. imperialism again listed carbolic acid, quick-cooking powder, and other major raw materials for manufacturing synthetic rubber as "strategic materials," prohibiting their export to our country. The number of industrial raw materials banned by U.S. imperialism from export to China, including white medicine and dinitro, has reached more than 20 kinds. At the same time, U.S. imperialism also prohibits the shipment of penicillin to the new China. All of these are using the name of "strategic materials" to carry out a blockade. In the same month, Hong Kong merchants ordered cotton from the United States, and New York replied that orders would not be accepted temporarily, showing that U.S. imperialism is prohibiting the export of cotton to Hong Kong. U.S. imperialism knows very well, as pointed out by the U.S. Department of Commerce in a report this spring: "Because most of the materials shipped to Hong Kong end up in the hands of the Chinese Communists." Especially cotton, which U.S. imperialism believes is the raw material most urgently needed by Chinese industry. Recently, the U.S. imperialist economic blockade against our country has been carried out even more relentlessly. On December 2nd, the U.S. Department of Commerce ordered strict control of all goods shipped to new China, Hong Kong, and Macao. This was an action taken by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sawyer "after consultation with the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other government agencies." The scope of this measure will be expanded to any port under U.S. jurisdiction, as well as the Panama Canal. All goods shipped from foreign countries through the United States and these ports must go through U.S. officials for outbound formalities. This kind of resistance and blockade by U.S. imperialism is a manifestation of its consistent hostility towards the People's China and its preparation for a war of aggression.

In addition to prohibiting the shipment of so-called "strategic materials" to new China itself, U.S. imperialism also prohibits other countries from exporting to us, undermining their trade relations with us, in order to achieve the goal of blockading our country. For example, in February of this year, the United States requested Britain to prohibit the export of "strategic materials" to new China. At that time, the British Department of Commerce ignored it. In April, the United States reiterated its request to all countries receiving Marshall Plan supplies to prohibit the export of "strategic materials" to China. In July, the United States gave the British government a note, requesting that Britain reduce or even stop exporting goods to the new China, not only oil, but also some other raw materials. Later, U.S. Senate Republican leader Wherry and others demanded cuts in Marshall Plan funding to coerce Britain to stop trading with us. What a shameless trick! Under the policy of "wherever the Stars and Stripes fly, the British flag will also fly beside them," Britain is bound to be an economic appendage of U.S. imperialism.

Hong Kong's trade with China occupies a considerably important position in China's foreign trade. For example, taking 1949 as an example, China's export trade to Hong Kong accounted for 47.83 percent, and import trade accounted for 10.29 percent. So U.S. imperialism came up with another idea. In the U.S. Secretary of Commerce's report in March of this year, it was mentioned: "In view of the unprecedented seriousness of the situation in Asia, the United States' export control over the area must be reconsidered; and because most of the materials shipped to Hong Kong end up in the hands of the Chinese Communists, the scope of our consideration must include Hong Kong." Thus, we saw on May 5th of this year that the Hong Kong government re-announced that the items prohibited from export were: petroleum, tinplate, various electroplated steel pipes and fittings, boiler tubes, steel plates, raw cotton, and burlap bags. On June 30th, the Hong Kong government announced a new export control ordinance. According to an analysis by the Hong Kong Economic Herald, one of the key points of the ordinance is that the addition of eleven kinds of goods prohibited from import to the new China has political implications. These eleven kinds of materials happen to be the main materials that U.S. imperialism prohibits from being shipped to Southeast Asia, and they were announced after U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea; therefore, it is well known that this is a step taken by Britain under the direction of U.S. imperialism. Later, on July 22nd, the Hong Kong government again announced that all liquid fuels are not allowed to be shipped to the new China. On August 11th, the Hong Kong government announced a ban on the export of 190 kinds of goods. These goods can be divided into ten categories: metal machinery, steel products, chemical raw materials, chemical instruments, non-ferrous metals, transportation equipment, oil exploration and storage equipment, radio equipment and manufacturing machines, naval equipment, and petroleum. After the Hong Kong government announced the ban on the export of ten categories of goods, Hong Kong merchants expressed concern because Hong Kong is a entrepot port, mainly relying on exports. In recent years, due to sluggish sales of goods, the commercial crisis has been quite serious; now that the export of many goods is banned, the inventory and goods in transit will have no way out, which will inevitably deepen the crisis. As expected, from July to August, the foreign exchange business of Hong Kong banks decreased to 40 percent, and the margin increased to 50 percent, or even 100 percent. The ordinance is unfavorable to Hong Kong merchants and unfavorable to the Hong Kong government. Its promulgation is undoubtedly due to the direction of U.S. imperialism.

Japan, directly ruled by U.S. imperialism, is eager to find sales channels for its export goods, so in June of this year, hardware, machinery parts, and other items were quoted to us one after another. However, under the rule of U.S. imperialism, Japan first tightened the control of food imports. In July, it restricted the import of Chinese egg products. As for oil exports, U.S. imperialism had already banned them in early May, especially transformer oil and gear oil. Japan's foreign trade must be approved by U.S. imperialism; it has the power to prohibit export items at any time. On September 8th, MacArthur had ordered a ban on the import of fuel, hardware, medicine, industrial raw materials, and other major items to the new China. On December 6th, Japan announced that, except for textiles, general merchandise, and seafood, all products are prohibited from being exported to the new China, North Korea, Hong Kong, and Macao. In the actual situation where Sino-Japanese trade mostly adopts barter trade, prohibiting the import of goods into China also stifles the possibility for Japan to obtain various cheap and necessary materials from China; therefore, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the result of the blockade of Japan's trade with me will inevitably arouse great dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. And U.S. imperialism's hostile blockade behavior against us is truly meticulous.

The Philippines' prohibition of "strategic materials" from being imported into China was carried out under the direction of U.S. imperialism. After the ministers of the Philippine Department of National Defense, Department of Foreign Affairs, and Department of Finance held a meeting at the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, the Philippine Department of Finance ordered on July 24th that all war materials, including weapons, ammunition, radio, radar equipment, gasoline, and Manila hemp, be prohibited from being shipped to the new China. In fact, the Philippines itself originally had no "strategic materials" to export. Sino-Philippine trade is negligible in China's foreign trade. China's exports to the Philippines accounted for only 0.96 percent of the total last year, while imports from the Philippines were almost zero. The pretentious expression of the Philippine government is nothing more than showing that U.S. imperialism is influencing all its subordinate countries to carry out an economic blockade against the new China in order to achieve the conspiracy to undermine the economy of the new China.

In addition, U.S. imperialism is also hindering other countries from trading with us. For example, in March of this year, the United States made a request to all countries supplied by the Marshall Plan to prohibit the import of "strategic materials" to the new China, and in April, it brought it up again. For example, in July of this year, U.S. imperialism demanded that the Dutch government stop delivering oil and "strategic materials" to the new China. These examples all illustrate that U.S. imperialism is trying to undermine the new China's foreign trade in every possible way, preventing the new China from establishing reasonable trade relations with other countries, so as to facilitate the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to prepare for an expanded war to realize its world expansion policy.

What are the so-called "strategic materials" of American imperialism? It is not simply a conceptual "strategic material" but a very complex and numerous collection of all production and necessary consumer materials; it is not an embargo on "strategic materials," but a complete economic blockade. For U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, it is hoarding strategic materials, preparing to expand its war of aggression, and on the other hand, it is trying to stifle the recovery and development of the Chinese economy through economic blockade; dreaming that this would subdue the new China, and that the new China would turn to U.S. imperialism for mercy. However, more than a year of practical experience has told U.S. imperialism that it is wrong, completely wrong. Although U.S. imperialism's economic blockade against China and its prevention of trade between other countries and us have hindered the establishment of normal economic relations between China and other countries, it has also damaged the trade relations between those countries and regions, which are very necessary, with the new China; thus harming their own trade interests and damaging their own national economies.

The difficulties caused by the U.S. imperialist economic blockade against us have been gradually broken by the liberation of the whole of China, the transformation of the colonialized economy into a new independent and autonomous economy, the restoration of industry, the development of transportation, the regulation of materials, the implementation of land reform, and the implementation of self-reliance policies such as thrift. The further our economy develops, the greater the power to break the blockade will be. The facts clearly show that while the economic blockade increases some difficulties in our country's construction, it also increases the Chinese people's determination to be self-reliant and generates the power of unity and construction. As we partially and gradually overcome many difficulties, the national economy is steadily moving forward. For example, this spring, the unified financial revenue and expenditure stabilized the price of goods that had been rising continuously for more than a decade; under the smooth implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, production has continued to increase; after the reasonable adjustment of public and private industry and commerce, the national industry and commerce began to improve; after land reform has been implemented in most areas, the lives of farmers have improved, and agricultural and industrial products have gained a wide domestic market; because the purchasing power of urban and rural areas has increased, the sales of manufactured products have greatly increased; for example, the sales of cloth in the Northeast, which used to be 800,000 bolts per year, have now increased to more than 3 million bolts. Under the government's decision to expand the cotton field plan, the problem of relying on foreign imports of cotton will be solved. This year's cotton production is 14 million dan, and the raw materials for cotton textiles can now be completely self-sufficient, and more than 4 million spindles have been fully put into operation. From this, we can see that U.S. imperialism's attempt to subdue us with the conspiracy of economically blockading our country is a delusion that will never be realized.

Not only that, but in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist economic blockade against us, we have also received the fraternal cooperation of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. While the enemy was blockading and destroying us, we signed a "barter agreement" with the Soviet Union in the Northeast. Later, we and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and five other agreements. In addition, new democratic countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany have established close economic relations with me, bartering and trading. We stand closely with these advanced countries, we are not isolated, our strength is great.

We are good at uniting all forces at home and abroad to consolidate our economic construction. With the development of our economy, the materials we export will increase day by day, and the machines and materials we need to import will also increase day by day. We will "restore and develop trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit" to promote and strengthen international cooperation, to break the U.S. imperialist minority monopoly groups that are manipulating the discriminatory and economically blockading trade against us, which is harmful to the establishment of normal international relations, and harmful to the true peace of the world policy.

    反对美帝国主义对我国的经济封锁政策
    素书
    维辛斯基十一月十八日在联合国五次大会全体会议上，关于赖伊所提谋取和平的二十年方案问题的演说里，曾严正地指出：“对外贸易的歧视政策是不符合联合国的原则和宗旨的。这种政策阻碍各国间建立正常的经济关系，它不符合国家的利益，并且是和增进并加强国际关系的基本任务相违背的。”他又指出，“对外贸易中的歧视政策仍在实施中，……其实施的规模日益扩大，尤其是美国和英国。”维辛斯基所正确地指出的实际情形，在远东方面，最明显的就是最近美帝加紧管制对中国的输出，并在杜艾会谈中，美帝提议用海军封锁中国海岸。这种行为，正是这种“规模日益扩大”的表现。
    美帝对中国的经济封锁，不自今日始，早在上海解放时，就在积极进行了。
    去年六月二十六日，台湾匪帮宣布封锁中国的一切海港。实际就是美帝所指使的一种阴谋。谁不明白，匪帮基地在台湾，除非帝国主义者帮忙，对中国整个东海岸实现真正有效的封锁是不可能的。但当匪帮实行对新中国海港封锁的时候，美帝却很狡狯地伪装“未获通知”，而拒绝发表意见。后来又用“研究封锁是否合法”，来推挡直接表示态度。中间还穿插一些什么“否认”，“抗议”的烟幕。但事实胜于雄辩，到十二月十七日美国国务院借口保护美国人民的安全，正式下令警告美国船只，不要驶往上海。国务院声明说：“上海港及其航路是一危险区域，不宜航行，美国船只，不应冒险驶往该地。”但是，在可得百分之百红利的条件之下，美国的船长——如飞剪号——就不顾国务院的通告，装上新中国所需要的物资，驶向上海。于是美国国务院又于十二月二十四日警告：“凡把船驶往国民党封锁港口的美国船主，皆可丧失其航行许可证。”这还不明显吗，谁是在封锁中国海岸。
    今年三月十二日，远在朝鲜战争发生之前，而正是美帝积极准备发动侵略朝鲜战争和积极向新民主主义国家挑衅的时候，美国商务部长在报告书中，已经透露凡运“战略物资”出口，必需具备输出许可证，并将出口商品项目，提呈商务部核验。
    美国执行管制的“战略物资”共达六百余种，大部分为重机器，机械工具，非铁金属，化学原料，钢铁制品，交通设备及液体燃料等。以后美帝不断用新的法令限制各种“战略物资”的输出：如本年五月间颁布了对汽车零件输出管制加严之法令。电池出口超过价值一百美元（约二十具电池），煞车部分零件价值超过五百美元，或煞车油价值超过一百美元者，均需向华盛顿商务部申请批准。七月间，实行禁止二十英寸宽二十八英寸长之白铁（俗称正张白铁）输至远东（包括香港在内）。又据美孚油公司声明，美国国务院要求该公司暂时完全停止将石油产品运到新中国。
    七月二十号，美国商务部宣布于该晚八时起撤废美货输往人民中国的出口许可证；持有人要一律立刻缴还此项撤废之许可证。已发许可证之出口货物为橡皮、石油、机器、轮胎及纺织品等。八月下旬，美帝又将石炭酸、快熟粉及其他主要制人造橡胶原料，列为“战略物资”，禁止输出我国。美帝禁止输出中国之工业原料，连同白药及二硝基在内，已达二十种以上。同时美帝还禁止盘尼西林运至新中国。这都是假“战略物资”之名，来进行封锁。同月，香港商人向美订购棉花，纽约方面复电暂时不接订单，可见美帝在禁止棉花输港。美帝知道很清楚，如美国商务部在今春的报告书中所指出：“由于输往香港的物资，大部皆落入中共之手。”尤其是棉花，美帝以为是中国工业需要最殷的原料。最近美帝对我国的经济封锁，更是变本加厉地进行着。十二月二日，美商务部下令严格管制运到新中国、香港和澳门的一切货物。这是美商务部长沙逸在“与国务院、国防部及其他政府机构协商后”采取的行动。这一措施的管制范围将扩大到美国管辖下的任何港口以及巴拿马运河，举凡从外国经过美国和这些港口而运出的货物，都必需经由美国官员办理出港手续。美帝这种抵制和封锁，是他一贯地敌视人民中国和准备侵略战争的表现。
    美帝除了自己禁止输运所谓“战略物资”至新中国之外，还禁止其他国家对我输出，破坏他们对我贸易关系，以达到封锁我国的目的。譬如今年二月间，美曾向英请求禁止输出“战略物资”至新中国。当时英商务部未予理会。四月间，美又向所有接受马歇尔计划供应品的国家重申它的禁止输出“战略物资”至中国的请求。七月间，美又给英国政府照会，提出要求英国减少，甚至于停止对新中国输出的货物；不仅是石油，并且还有些其他原料。后来美国参议院共和党领袖惠利等要求削减马歇尔计划拨款来胁迫英国停止对我贸易，这是如何无耻的一种伎俩啊！英国在美帝指使之下，从七月十八日起，禁止各种矿物油出口，与美帝采取同一步调！十二月六日，美参议员三人又叫嚣英应禁运一切物资至新中国。在“凡是有星条旗飘扬的地方，英国旗帜也将在它们的旁边飘扬”的政策下，英国是难免甘作美帝的经济附庸的。
    香港对中国的贸易是占中国对外贸易的相当重要的位置的。譬如拿一九四九年来说，中国出口贸易对香港是百分之四十七点八三，进口贸易是百分之十点二九。于是美帝又来动脑筋了。在今年三月间美国商务部长的报告书中提到：“鉴于亚洲的局势的空前严重，美国对该地输出管制自有重新考虑之必要；且由于输往香港的物资，大部分皆落入中共之手，故吾人之考虑范围必须包括香港在内。”于是我们看到本年五月五日香港政府重新公布禁止出口之物品为：石油，马口铁，各种电镀钢管及配件，汽锅管，钢板，原棉及麻袋等项。六月三十日，香港政府公布新输出管制法令。据香港经济导报的分析，该法令的一个要点就是新增十一种货物禁止输入新中国是具有政治意味的。这十一种物资恰巧是美帝禁止输往东南亚的主要物资，并且是在美帝发动侵略朝鲜战争之后公布的；故众所周知这是英国受了美帝的指使所采取的步骤。以后，七月二十二日，香港政府再宣告所有液体燃料一律不准运至新中国。八月十一日，香港政府又公布禁止一百九十种货品出口。这些货品，可分为十大类：金属机器，钢铁制品，化学原料，化学仪器，非铁金属，交通器材，开采和储藏石油装备，无线电器材和制造机，海军设备及石油。自香港政府宣布十大类货品禁止出口后，香港商人即表示忧虑，因香港是一个转口商埠，主要依赖出口。年来因货物滞销，商业危机已相当严重；如今更禁绝多种货物出口，则存货及路货均将没有出路，如此则危机必然加深。果然不出所料，自七月至八月间，香港各银行之押汇业务减少至百分之四十，押金提高至百分之五十，甚至百分之一百。该法令不利于香港商人，亦不利于香港政府。他的公布，毫无疑义是出于美帝的指使。
    美帝直接统治下的日本是亟愿为其出口货获得销路，故于本年六月间，五金机械零件等，纷纷向我报价。可是，在美帝统治之下，日本首先对食品进口管制加严。于七月间，限制中国蛋品进口。至于油类输出，则早在五月上旬，美帝已加禁止，特别是变压器油及齿轮油。日本对外贸易，必须经美帝批准；对输出物品，随时有禁止之权力。九月八日，麦克阿瑟已下令禁止燃料，五金，药品，工业原料等主要物品输入新中国。十二月六日，日本宣布除了纺织品，百货及海味之外，一切生产品均禁止出口至新中国，北朝鲜，香港及澳门。在中日贸易多半是采用易货方式之实际情况下，禁止物品输入中国，同时也便窒息了日本从中国取得各种廉价而必需的物资的可能；故在美帝操纵下，日本对我贸易被封锁之结果，将引起日本人民之大大不满是不言而喻的。而美帝对我敌视的封锁行为真是无微不至了。
    菲律宾禁止“战略物资”输入中国是在美帝指使之下进行的事实更为明显。菲国防部，外交部和财政部各部长在美驻菲大使馆举行了会议之后，七月二十四日由菲财政部下令禁止所有作战物资，包括武器，军火，无线电，雷达设备，汽油及马尼剌麻运至新中国。事实上菲律宾本土原没有什么“战略物资”可以出口，中菲贸易在中国对外贸易的比重上是微不足道。中国对菲出口在去年仅占全额百分之零点九六，而由菲进口是几等于零。菲政府那种装腔作势的表示，无非是表明美帝在影响其一切附从国家对新中国进行经济封锁，以达到破坏新中国经济的阴谋而已。
    此外，美帝尚阻挠其他国家与我贸易。如今年三月间，美曾向所有马歇尔计划供应国家提出禁止输入“战略物资”至新中国的请求，至四月间，又重提一次。又如今年七月，美帝要求荷兰政府停止交运石油与“战略物资”给新中国。这些实例都说明了美帝是在无孔不入地企图破坏新中国对外贸易，阻止新中国与世界各国建立合理的贸易关系，以便于美帝实行准备扩大战争，以实现其世界扩张政策之阴谋活动。
    美国帝国主义所谓的“战略物资”是什么呢？它并非单纯观念的“战略物资”而是很复杂而繁多的包括了一切生产和必需消费的物资；它不是“战略物资”的禁运，而是全部经济封锁。这在美帝来讲一方面是它要囤积战略物资，准备扩大侵略战争，一方面是企图用经济封锁来窒死中国经济的恢复和发展；梦想着这样就可以把新中国制服，就可以要新中国转而向美帝求饶。而一年多的现实经验，告诉了美帝，它想错了，它完全想错了。美帝对中国的经济封锁及阻止各国对我贸易，虽然妨碍了中国与各国之间建立正常的经济关系，但亦破坏了那些国家与地区所十分必需的，对新中国的贸易关系；因而危害了他们自己的贸易利益，损坏了他们自己的国民经济。
    美帝对我经济封锁所造成的困难，已随着全中国的解放，把殖民地化的经济，变为新的独立自主的经济，恢复工业，发展交通，调节物资，实行土改和实行节约等自力更生的政策所逐渐打破了。我们的经济愈往前发展，则打破封锁的力量将愈大。事实明显地说明：固然，经济封锁增加我国建设中一些困难，可是他同时也增加了中国人民自力更生的决心，产生了团结建设的力量。当我们部分地，逐渐地克服许多困难的过程中，全国的经济是在稳步地向前迈进。譬如，今春统一了财政收支，稳定了十数年来不断高涨的物价；在公私兼顾，劳资两利的政策顺利执行之下，生产不断地提高；在合理地调整了公私工商业之后，全国工商业开始好转；在大部分地区已实行了土地改革之后，农民生活改善，工农产品得到广大的国内市场；因为城乡的购买力提高，制成品的销路大大增加；如东北的布匹，以前年销八十万匹的，现在增加到三百万匹以上。在政府决定扩充棉田计划下，棉花要摆脱过去倚靠国外进口的问题得到解决。今年棉花产量为一千四百万担，棉纺织原料完全可以从此自给，四百多万纺锭已经十足开工了。这可以看到美帝企图以经济封锁我国的阴谋使我们屈服的妄想是永远不可能实现的。
    不但如此，我们在反对美帝对我经济封锁的斗争中，我们还得到苏联和新民主主义国家的兄弟般的合作。在敌人对我封锁和破坏的同时，我们在东北与苏联订了“易货协定”。后来我们和苏联又订了中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他五个协定。此外捷克，波兰，西德等新民主主义国家都与我建立了密切的经济关系，易货通商。我们和这些先进的国家紧密地站在一起，我们不是孤立的，我们的力量是伟大的。
    我们是善于团结国内外一切力量来巩固我们的经济建设的。跟着我们经济的发展，我们出口的物资将会一天天增多，而我们所需要进口的机器和物资，也会一天天增多，我们将要“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”以增进和加强国际合作，以打破美帝少数垄断集团所操纵着的，对我贸易歧视，和经济封锁的，有害于建立国际正常关系，和有害于世界真正和平的政策。
