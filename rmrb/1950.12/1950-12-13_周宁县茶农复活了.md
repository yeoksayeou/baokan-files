To the Editor:

    The lives of tea farmers here have taken on a new look. Our Zhouning County is a small county in northeastern Fujian, famous for its tea production (the black tea produced is well-known domestically). One year after liberation, with the support of the People's Government, the lives of tea farmers have greatly improved. For example, tea farmer Zhou Hongzhu sold seventy catties of tea and made two new outfits. He said, "I've worn tattered clothes for decades, and this year I finally made new clothes!" Tea worker Liu Fotan used to rely on borrowing money every year to make a living. This year, he worked in the tea factory and earned 860 catties of rice, completely solving the livelihood of his family of six.

    In Zhouning County, people who depend on tea production for their livelihoods account for more than one-third of the county's population. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the annual output was 16,000 dan, accounting for 30% of the total agricultural income of the county. However, tea production could not be developed in the old society, especially under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Production decreased year by year, and by 1949, before liberation, it had decreased to 4,000 dan. Tea farmers suffered from layer upon layer of exploitation, and their suffering was unspeakable. Most of the tea merchants, tea firms, and tea warehouses in Zhouning were run by feudal landlords. Relying on their special power, they systematically manipulated the tea market and controlled tea prices. They also exploited tea farmers through high-interest loans, using 24-liang scales, deducting weight, discounting by 30%, omitting odd amounts of money, delaying tea payments, and offsetting with goods. In addition, renting mountains from landlords to plant tea required paying high rents, or even performing unpaid labor for landlords to maintain the tea gardens. Tea farmers had no hope for production and were forced to stop fertilizing, allowing the gardens to become barren, and the tea mountains gradually shrank. A few sayings were popular among tea farmers: "Sweet potatoes as food, drying baskets as cotton-padded jackets, rice straw as quilts, bamboo torches for light." This clearly shows the lives of the oppressed and exploited tea farmers.

    But Zhouning was liberated last year. Shortly after liberation, the People's Government issued 92,700 catties of tea loans, directly to poor tea farmers. At the same time, due to the establishment of a purchasing station by the China Tea Company in the county, tea was purchased vigorously at reasonable prices and with standard market scales. The morale of the tea farmers was boosted, and this year's output quickly increased from 4,000 dan in the last year of Kuomintang reactionary rule to 7,000 dan.

    We helped tea farmers calculate and summarize this year's tea income, which can be converted into 34.3 million catties of rice. Based on 20,000 tea farmers in Zhouning County, the average income per person is more than 1,700 catties of rice. From these facts, tea farmers deeply feel the benefits of the People's Government, which has laid a solid foundation for the future development of tea production.

### 周宁县茶农复活了

    周宁县茶农复活了编辑同志：
    我们这里的茶农生活，已经有了一些新的气象。我们周宁县是福建东北的一个小县，以出产茶叶著名（所产红茶在国内都有名）。茶农在解放一年后，经过人民政府的扶植，生活大有起色。比方茶农周鸿渚卖了七十斤茶，制了两件新衣，他说：“破衣服我穿了几十年，今年才做了新衣穿！”制茶工刘佛潭过去每年都靠借债维持生活，今年在制茶所做工，赚米八百六十斤，完全解决了全家六口人的生活。
    周宁县靠茶产生活的人占全县三分之一以上，抗战以前，年产一万六千担，占全县农产物总收入的百分之三十。但是茶产在旧社会里是得不到发展的，特别是在国民党反动统治之下，年年减产，一九四九年解放前，竟减产到四千担。茶农遭受层层剥削，痛苦不堪。周宁所有茶商、茶号、茶栈绝大部分是封建地主搞的，他们依仗特殊势力，有计划地操纵茶叶市场，支配茶叶价格。并用高利贷，二十四两大秤，扣斤两，打七折，抹钱尾，拖欠茶款，抵给货物等方式来剥削茶农。此外，从地主手里租山植茶，必须付出高额地租，甚或还得替地主作整理茶园的无偿劳动。茶农生产无望，被迫停止施肥，任其荒芜，茶山逐渐缩小。茶农当中流行着几句话：“地瓜当粮食，烘笼当棉袄，稻草当被盖，竹把当火照”。被压迫剥削的茶农是什么生活，这已经说得很清楚了。
    但是去年周宁解放了。解放不久，人民政府即发放了九万二千七百斤茶叶贷款，直接贷放到贫苦茶农手中。同时，由于中茶公司在县里设立收购站，用合理的价格，通用的市秤，大力收购茶叶。茶农情绪被鼓舞起来了，今年产量即从国民党反动统治最后一年的四千担迅速增加到七千担。
    我们帮茶农计算一下，总结今年茶产的收入，可折合成三千四百三十万斤米，以周宁全县茶农二万人计算，平均每人可收入一千七百多斤米。从这些地方，茶农深深感到人民政府的好处，这就为今后发展茶叶生产奠定了坚实的基础。
