Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th:

    *Izvestia* recently published an editorial entitled "On the Truman-Attlee Communiqué," stating:

    The defeats suffered by the American aggressor troops in Korea have been reflected in the leading groups of the United States and Britain. It is well known that the failures of the American interventionists closely followed the victory messages issued by MacArthur, who had assured the American troops that they could end the war before Christmas. In response to the failures of the American aggression in Korea, the majority of the American aggressive groups openly advocated a provocative policy towards the People's Republic of China. Public opinion in various countries is extremely indignant at this policy. The call for a speedy resolution of the Korean issue is growing louder and louder in the United States and Britain. Such demands have even appeared in the pages of some bourgeois newspapers and have been revealed by individual political leaders close to the US-British ruling groups.

    This was the situation when Truman and Attlee held their meeting in Washington. They had to draw some conclusions from the situation created by the American aggressive policy in the Far East at this meeting.

    The communiqué, issued after the meeting as a joint statement by Truman and Attlee, shows that the US-British imperialists have not learned any lessons from the Korean incident and have stubbornly decided to continue their aggression against the Korean people, moving in the direction of expanding this aggression, regardless of the increasingly loud calls for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue within the United States and Britain.

    As a result of the meeting, the main conclusion reached by Truman and Attlee was to decide to intensify the arms race in the countries belonging to the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance. In other words, the agreement reached by Truman and Attlee was to accelerate preparations for a new world war, subordinating all other political and economic issues to this main task of American and British foreign policy. The communiqué makes it very clear that troops will be increased by all means, and military production will be expanded by reducing other economic sectors. U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall's statement that Truman intends to declare a "state of emergency" in the United States in order to accelerate the implementation of the war plan is a very vivid illustration of the outcome of the Washington meeting. A piece of news in the British *Sunday Express* also illustrates the same thing. This news predicts that Britain will implement wartime tax rates in order to pay for the greatly increased cost of rearmament.

    In short, Truman and Attlee have once again shown the world that armed aggression is the core of the US and British ruling groups' foreign policy; they are striving for war, not for peace. As for the general assurance in the communiqué that the United States and Britain seek peace and a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues, it is only used as a smokescreen. The US-British imperialists believe that this smokescreen is the best way to conceal new war preparations.

    It is not the Koreans who have invaded the United States, but the US imperialists who are carrying out a war of aggression on Korean territory thousands of miles away from their own borders.

    It is not the People's Republic of China that has invaded or is invading any part of American territory, but the American government that has invaded Chinese territory with its troops—the island of Taiwan—and is supplying more weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for it to invade liberated China.

    The Washington communiqué only shows to the broad masses of the international community who the real aggressors are. This is new evidence proving that the United States and Britain are keen on pursuing an aggressive policy towards Korea and Taiwan.

    The drafters of the communiqué painstakingly tried to create the impression that the main partners of the North Atlantic Alliance—the United States and Britain—are in complete agreement on all international policy issues. However, on one issue, precisely on the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations, the communiqué could not conceal the differences between the United States and Britain. The American government has once again reaffirmed its hostility towards the government of the People's Republic of China and its willingness to continue supporting the rotten Chiang Kai-shek clique; but this is something the British government no longer dares to do.

    But, in fact, the contradictions between the two partners of the imperialist bloc have been temporarily eased and pushed behind the scenes at the complete sacrifice of British interests. Attlee slavishly followed Truman on all issues in Washington, damaging the prestige of the already damaged British Empire. Attlee adopted the American view on the status of Taiwan, thus following the United States and abandoning the obligations undertaken by Britain under the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. Is this not a clear indication of the British government's lack of independence in its relations with China? Does this not prove that the Labor government, like the American government, is preparing to abandon its own promise of "respecting the rights and interests of all countries" for the purpose of aggression?

    On the issue of controlling various basic strategic raw materials, which is also a major difference between the United States and Britain, a decision was also made during the talks based on the interests of the Wall Street industrial giants. Britain has withdrawn its opposition to the establishment of international control over various basic raw materials (including tin, rubber, and wool). It is well known that various important industrial raw materials are the main source of US dollars for the British government. Now this trump card has been taken away from Britain.

    On the issue of the main financial sources for rearmament, Britain also had to give in. The *Sunday Express* wrote: Attlee will soon return home from Washington, bringing with him a plan to implement an earlier and more costly expansion plan, which will have a serious impact on every Briton.

    The entire original communiqué is infused with the desire of the US and British ruling groups to expand aggression and intensify preparations for a new world war, and there is no desire for peace or a peaceful resolution of the international issues that have already surfaced. To this end, they are using the tense situation they themselves have created in the Far East, just as Truman, MacArthur, and Harriman had previously used the aggressive attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the same goal.

    As proven by the increasing number of comments in newspapers around the world, the Truman-Attlee communiqué cannot even satisfy those who originally hoped that the heads of the US and British governments would accomplish something at this meeting to at least end the shameful war being waged in Korea, far from the borders of the United States. On the contrary, the publication of the new US-British communiqué is intended to fan the flames of war hysteria in the United States, Britain, and other countries linked to their policies.

    This communiqué shows that the ruling groups in the United States and Britain are not adopting a course of action that is truly beneficial to the American and British people. Their actions are not aimed at creating peace, but at preparing imperialist aggression, and therefore they are making their policies oppose the interests of the peace-loving people of the East and the West.

    消息报论杜艾会谈
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：消息报顷以“论杜鲁门艾德礼的公报”为题发表社论称：
    美国侵略者的军队在朝鲜遭到的失败，已在美英领导集团中反映出来。人所共知，美国干涉者的失败是紧随麦克阿瑟所发出的胜利消息而来的，他曾向美军保证他们可以在圣诞节前结束战争。美国大多数的侵略集团为答复美国侵略朝鲜所遭到的失败公然主张对中华人民共和国挑衅的政策方针，各国广大舆论，对此方针感到异常愤慨。要求尽速解决朝鲜问题的呼声在美国与英国愈来愈响亮了。这样的要求甚至已在一部分资产阶级报纸的版面上出现，并且为接近美英统治集团的个别政治领袖所透露出来。
    这就是杜鲁门与艾德礼在华盛顿举行会议时的情势。他们要在这一会议上从美国对远东的侵略政策所造成的情势中得出一些结论。
    在会后发表的，作为杜鲁门与艾德礼的联合声明的公报说明了美英帝国主义者从朝鲜事件中并没有得到任何教训，并且已经顽固地决定要继续侵略朝鲜人民，朝着扩大这一侵略的方向前进，而不顾美国和英国国内日益响亮的要求和平解决朝鲜问题的呼声。
    作为会议的结果，杜鲁门与艾德礼所得到的主要结论就是：决定在侵略性北大西洋联盟所属国家中加紧军备竞赛。换句话说，杜鲁门与艾德礼所达到的协议就是加速准备新的世界大战，而使其他一切政治与经济的问题服从于美国与英国外交政策的这个主要任务。公报中说得很清楚，将以一切办法来增加军队，将减少其他经济部门来扩大军事生产。美国国防部长马歇尔说，杜鲁门打算在美国宣布“紧急状态”，以便加速实施战争计划，马歇尔的这段话就是华盛顿会议的结果的极生动的说明。英国报纸星期日快讯报上的一则消息也说明了同样事情，这则消息预测英国将实施战时税率，以求能支付大大增加中的重整军备的费用。
    总之，杜鲁门和艾德礼已再度向全世界显示，武装侵略是美国与英国统治集团外交政策的核心；他们是在为战争而不是为和平努力。至于公报中提出的所谓美国与英国谋求和平与和平解决一切未决问题的这个一般性保证，只是用来充当烟幕而已。美英帝国主义者相信这个烟幕是掩饰新战争准备的最好方法。
    并不是朝鲜人闯进美国，而是美帝国主义者在离开他们自己国境数千英里以外的朝鲜领土上进行侵略战争。
    并不是中华人民共和国侵犯了或正在侵犯美国领土的任何部分，而是美国政府用它的军队侵犯了中国领土，——台湾岛——并正在以更多的武器供给蒋介石匪帮，供它进犯解放了的中国。
    华盛顿公报仅仅向国际上的广大人士表明了谁是真正的侵略者。这是一个新的证据。证明美国和英国热中于对朝鲜及台湾实行侵略政策。
    公报的起草人煞费苦心地想造成一个印象，就是：北大西洋联盟的主要伙伴——美国和英国——在一切国际政策问题上完全一致。但是，在一个问题上，恰恰就是在中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题上，公报就无法掩盖美国与英国之间的分歧了。美国政府已再度证实了它对中华人民共和国政府的敌视，以及其继续支持腐烂透顶的蒋介石集团的意愿；可是这却是英国政府再也不敢做的事。
    可是，事实上，帝国主义集团的两个伙伴之间的矛盾却由于完全牺牲英国的利益而暂时得到缓和并被推到了背后。艾德礼在华盛顿对所有的问题都俯首贴耳地跟着杜鲁门跑，损害着已经被破坏了的不列颠帝国的威望。艾德礼采取了美国关于台湾岛地位问题的观点，这样他就跟随着美国，而背弃了英国因开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言所承担的义务。这难道不是英国政府在英国对中国关系的问题上缺乏独立的明证么？难道这不证明着工党政府像美国政府一样地为了侵略的目的而准备背弃它自己“关于尊重各国的权利和利益”的诺言么？
    关于管制各种基本战略原料的问题，也就是美英之间存在着重大分歧的问题，也在会谈中根据华尔街工业巨头们的利益作了决定。英国已撤消了它对各种基本原料（包括锡、橡胶、羊毛）建立国际管制的反对意见。大家知道，各种重要工业原料乃是英国政府获得美元的主要来源。现在这张王牌已从英国手里夺掉了。
    在重整军备的主要财政来源的问题上，英国也不得不让步。星期日快讯报写道：艾德礼即将从华盛顿回国，带来尽早实行耗费更大的扩军方案的计划，这将对每个英国人产生严重影响。
    整个公报原文都灌注着美英统治集团扩大侵略、加紧准备新的世界大战的愿望，而没有要和平、或和平地解决业已表面化的国际问题的愿望。为了这个目的，他们正利用他们自己在远东所制造的紧张局势，正如杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟及哈里曼在此以前曾利用对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略进攻以达到同样目的一样。
    正如各国报纸上愈来愈多的评论所证明的那样，杜鲁门、艾德礼公报甚至不能使那些原来希望美英两国政府首长将在这次会议上有所作为而至少使那个在距离美国边境老远的朝鲜境内所进行的可耻的战争归于结束的人们感到满意。相反地，新的美英文告之发表是为了在美、英及其他与它们的政策联系在一起的国家煽起战争歇斯底里的火焰。
    这个公报显示：美国和英国的统治集团并不采取真正有利于美英人民的方针。他们的举动并不是在于缔造和平，而是在于准备帝国主义的侵略力量，因此他们是在使他们的政策反对东方西方爱好和平的人民的利益。
