    "Jiasheba" – New Han People
    – Improvement in Tibetan-Han Relations Begins in the Kangding Area
    By our reporter with the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Delegation, Shen Shi

    I. Brief Introduction to the Kangding Area

    The Kangding area extends from the Dadu River in the east to the Jinsha River in the west, borders Yunnan in the south, and connects to Sichuan in the northeast. It covers an area of approximately 200,000 square kilometers. The entire area consists of more than twenty counties, including Luding, Kangding, Danba, Qianning, Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, Dege, Dengke, Shiqu, Baiyu, Zhamuhua, Ba’an, Lihua, Yajiang, Yidun, Daocheng, Dingxiang, Derong, and Jiulong. Except for Luding, Kangding, and Jiulong, which are inhabited by Han people, Yi people, and a small number of Hui people, all other counties are predominantly Tibetan areas. The total population of the area is not precisely recorded, but according to old materials, it is about 400,000, with Tibetans accounting for 90%. The Tibetan people deeply believe in Buddhism, and there are about 50,000 lamas in the entire area. Taking Ganzi as an example, lamas account for about one-third of the county's population of over 15,000. Although Zhao Erfeng implemented the "Reform of Native Chieftains" in the late Qing Dynasty, the Tusi system still exists to this day.

    II. Han Chauvinism Creates a Divide Between Tibetans and Han

    The traditional high-pressure and enslavement policies of successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionary bandits towards the Tibetan people forced the Tibetan people to live a poor life on the barren highlands and mountains. The great massacres by Zhao Erfeng in the Jinsha and Yalong River areas in the late Qing Dynasty are still remembered with lingering fear by Tibetan elders today. The burning of the Da Jin Temple near Ganzi by the Kuomintang reactionary bandits in 1931, and the so-called "Ganzi Incident" provoked in 1938-1939 are deeply etched in the minds of the living Buddhas, lamas, Tusi, and headmen of northern Kham. "Giving the barbarian an inch is worse than beating him" – this bloody howl of suppressing the Tibetan people, and county names such as "Ba'an," "Lihua," and "Zhamuhua," which flaunt the conqueror's reign over Tibetan-populated areas, are the easiest to agitate the Tibetan people's feelings and arouse resentment. As for the blockade of tea seeds, the strict prohibition of tea planting in Tibetan areas, the monopoly of local products, unequal exchange in trade, the use of large pecks, pointed pecks, and kicking pecks in grain collection, and the myriad tax items, the Tibetan people are filled with indignation and tears whenever they are mentioned. A review of the files of those who spoke for the reactionary rulers makes it clear that a huge debt of blood has been owed by the reactionary rulers for thousands of years. "A person falling into the water must grab at a reed." How much more so the vast Tibetan people who have been groaning in a sea of blood for generations? They are eager to remove their heavy shackles.

    Since the reactionary rulers have sown such deep seeds of hatred, and they have no area to retreat to, their suspicion and vigilance are justified in order to preserve their race and safeguard their own interests. However, the divide created by Han chauvinists in national sentiments in history must be filled in the future, and the estrangement between the Tibetan and Han peoples must be eliminated. The Communist Party members and revolutionary workers in the Kangding area have already taken on this heavy task. The work of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Kangding area and the People's Government in the past six months has initially opened up the path to improving Han-Tibetan relations.

    III. Correctly Implementing National Policies, Uniting All Strata of Tibetans

    General Liu Wenhui revolted, and the Kangding area was peacefully liberated. On March 24th, the People's Liberation Army entered Kangding, and on April 28th, it entered Ganzi. Subsequently, military representatives from Yajiang, Ba’an, and other counties successively carried out takeover work, and the oppression of the Tibetan people in the Kangding area by Han chauvinism was declared over. However, this did not eliminate their hatred for Han chauvinism, nor did it eliminate the historical national estrangement. Coupled with the rumors and slanders of bandits, secret agents, and bad elements, the Tibetan people suspected the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Lamas asked: "Will the People's Liberation Army allow freedom of religious belief in the future?" Tusi and headmen asked: "Will the Tusi system be allowed to exist?" Some said: "The People's Liberation Army is the army of the Han people, like clouds in the sky, blown away by a gust of wind." At that time, the highway from Ya'an to Ganzi had not yet been completed, and food from the rear could not be transported immediately. Under these difficult circumstances, the Party, government, and military comrades at all levels in the Kangding area, adhering to the principle of "strengthening unity and eliminating estrangement," carefully assessed the situation and moved forward step by step in carrying out various tasks. They strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, truly respecting the customs and habits of the Tibetan people and not entering lama temples. Even when food was sometimes unavailable, the officers and soldiers would dig up wild vegetables and hunt marmots to satisfy their hunger. During marches, soldiers carried more than eighty pounds of food, crossing the Erlang Mountains at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters and the Zheduo Mountains at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, without ever requisitioning livestock from the masses. Sometimes, when they could not find lodging, they camped in the wild, never staying in lama temples. Especially in the rush to repair the highway from Ya'an to Ganzi, the officers and soldiers of our engineering corps, regardless of heavy rain, hunger, cold, poisonous snakes, and leeches, completed this trunk line of more than a thousand kilometers ahead of schedule. This unprecedented good mass discipline moved the vast Tibetan people. When they saw our officers and soldiers eating wild vegetables and marmots, they automatically sent butter and zanba to the officers and soldiers. They said: "What the Kuomintang reactionaries failed to do in more than thirty years, the People's Liberation Army has done in less than half a year (referring to the construction of the highway)." Tibetan women said: "The People's Liberation Army is really one of our own, they don't requisition our livestock, they engage in fair buying and selling, and they even help us fetch water and cut grass. We have never seen such a good army."

    After the liberation of Kangding, a military control commission was established, with Tibetans Xia Ke Daodeng, Bangda Duoji, Ping Cuo Wangjie, and others as members of the military control commission. The political status of Tibetans was improved, and they all said: "The Communist Party truly advocates national equality. Out of fifteen members, eight are Tibetans." The Kangding Military Control Commission and the military representatives stationed in Ganzi, Luhuo, Yajiang, and other places consulted with local Tusi, headmen, living Buddhas, Khenpos, etc. in advance on important administrative measures, solicited their opinions, and implemented them after obtaining their consent. Therefore, they gained the trust of people from all walks of life, especially the Tusi, headmen, living Buddhas, and lamas. They regarded the military representatives as their own representatives, and always sought military representatives to solve any problems. They said: "We didn't dare to even look at the Yamen of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Now, our military representatives are just like one of our own." Kangding County has already held the first session of the representative conference of people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life. Among the 263 representatives attending this conference, 97 were Tibetan representatives, 21 were Yi representatives, and 8 were Hui representatives. Through this conference, the representatives further understood the various policies of the People's Government. They knew that the burden of public grain was much lighter than during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and it was taken from the people and used for the people. Therefore, after returning to their hometowns, they publicized the government's policies and the situation of the representative conference everywhere. Ren Zhen Wangjia, the Baozheng of Rongguan Township, went home after the meeting, delivered the best grain, and called on the masses to deliver the best grain. The township delivered 180 shi of public grain in three days. A Bao of Atai Township paid all the grain for the entire Bao at once. They said: "This year's grain delivery is the fairest. It's cleared at once, without large pecks, pointed pecks, kicking pecks, and other tricks."

    Tibetan cadres who participate in the work of the People's Government have positions and powers, and their opinions are respected and adopted. The simple working style and sincere attitude of Miao Fengshu, director of the Kangding Military Control Commission, and Tian Bao, a member of the committee, moved the Tibetans who had contact with them. Their confidence was enhanced, and they worked actively. Living Buddha Geda and Xia Ke Daodeng, among others, strongly supported the People's Liberation Army.

    Due to the above-mentioned work, all strata of the Tibetan people, especially the upper strata, were united around the People's Government and assisted the government in various tasks, enabling the work to be gradually carried out.

    IV. "Plateau-izing" and "Kang-Tibetan-izing" Life

    Kang-Tibetan areas are located on plateaus, with an average altitude of about 3,000 meters. Rice is sometimes difficult to cook thoroughly, and Tibetans mainly eat milk, butter, and zanba as their staple food. Although the highway from Ya'an to Ganzi has been completed, grain is being transported in continuously. In order to integrate life with the Tibetan people, the Party Committee of a certain unit stationed in the Ganzi area proposed the slogan of "Plateau-izing" and "Kang-Tibetan-izing" life, calling on all officers, soldiers, and working comrades to drink milk, eat butter and zanba, knit wool socks and gloves, and learn Tibetan. At first, the soldiers were not used to drinking milk or eating butter and zanba. Some said: "Milk is for little kids, what's the point of us thirty-year-olds drinking milk?" Some also couldn't swallow butter when they ate it. After a short period of experimentation, and then more experimentation, everyone got used to it and liked to eat butter and zanba.

    As a result of "Kang-Tibetan-izing" and "Plateau-izing" life, the officers and soldiers became stronger, and each one of them grew plump and ruddy. Because life was close to the Tibetan people, the relationship between the army and the people was further strengthened. The Tibetan people said: "The People's Liberation Army is really one of our own. What we eat, they also eat." This gain shows that "Plateau-izing" and "Kang-Tibetan-izing" life is a concrete mass viewpoint, and more deeply embodies the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention in practical actions. It also fully shows that only practical actions can eliminate the historical national estrangement.

    V. Preliminary Improvement in Han-Tibetan Relations, This Is the Achievement.

    The Tibetan people in the Ganzi area call the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the working comrades of the People's Government "Jiasheba" (New Han People), believing that the People's Liberation Army are all saints, and even the air in their stomachs has been eliminated (meaning they are cultivated people). This tells people that the work in the Kangding area in the past six months has established a good relationship with the Tibetan people, making them realize the essential difference between the people's regime and the Kuomintang reactionary regime. The achievement of this success is, of course, the result of the hard work of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and all the working comrades of the People's Government in the Kangding area, but it is inseparable from the leadership of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Government of Xikang Province, and the Party Committee of the Xikang Region of the Communist Party of China. Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and Deng Xiaoping, Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, often warned the comrades working in ethnic minority areas not to be impatient, but to do things steadily, and to take a step forward only after carefully assessing the situation. And they instructed that the working policy in ethnic minority areas is to "strengthen unity and eliminate estrangement." Liao Zhigao, Chairman of the People's Government of Xikang Province and Secretary of the Party Committee of the Xikang Region of the Communist Party of China, followed the instructions of the higher authorities and immediately corrected any deviations in the work of a certain area.

    The work in the Kangding area in the past six months fully proves that the national policy of the Common Program of the CPPCC can and can eliminate the historical national estrangement, making the people of all ethnic groups melt into a big family.

    VI. Continue to Study National Policies,

    The work in the Kangding area in the past six months has indeed made certain achievements, but it should be affirmed that this is only the beginning of the work, and the elimination of the historical national estrangement is a long-term process, and many new tasks need to be "started." The experience of the past six months should be given high attention by the leaders of the area in the future. First of all, it is necessary to organize and plan the study of national policies. Although cadres at all levels have not made major deviations in the implementation of national policies, a few comrades still have vague and incomplete understanding of national policies, and there are still signs of impatience in their work. For example, some soldiers helped Tibetans with the autumn harvest, and felt dissatisfied when they saw lamas come to ask for alms. Some comrades said when they saw zanba being burned in lama temples: "The common people have no food to eat, and you are still burning zanba." Therefore, adhering to the study of national policies should become an important topic for the comrades working in this area. Every working comrade should deeply appreciate the earnest warning of Secretary Deng Xiaoping: "If ninety-nine out of a hundred cadres do well, the things can still be ruined if one cadre makes trouble."

    At the same time, the leaders of the area should prevent the "leftist" emotions among the cadres. For example, some cadres are dissatisfied with the presence of Tusi and headmen in the regime, and are unwilling to approach the upper strata. Therefore, the leaders should patiently persuade and educate these comrades, so that they can establish a long-term view of serving the Tibetan people.

    Today, the Tibetan people's demand is for the gradual realization of the policies announced by the government. They demand regional autonomy. In fact, the Kangding Military Control Commission is preparing to gradually do so according to their demands. The upcoming National Consultative Conference and the upcoming Autonomous Region People's Government are important measures to realize the demands of the Tibetan people.

    The work in the Kangding area in the past six months has achieved certain results. In the future, under the leadership of the People's Government, as long as we continue to follow the principle of "steady progress," we will surely see that Han-Tibetan relations will become increasingly harmonious, and the Tibetan people will surely embark on the path of prosperity and happiness.

    “嘉色巴”——新汉人
    ——康定地区藏汉关系开始改善
    本报随中央西南各民族访问团记者  沈石
    一、康定地区简略介绍
    康定地区，东起大渡河，西迄金沙江，南临云南，东北接四川。面积约二十万平方公里左右。全区二十余，计炉定、康定、丹巴、乾宁、道孚、炉霍、甘孜、德格、邓柯、石渠、白玉、瞻化、巴安、理化、雅江、义敦、稻城、定乡、德荣、九龙。除炉定、康定、九龙住有汉人、彝人和少数回民外，各县均为藏族聚居地区。全区人口没有精确统计，根据旧有材料，约四十万左右，藏民占百分之九十。藏民深信佛教，全区喇嘛约五万人。拿甘孜来说，全县一万五千余人口，喇嘛约占三分之一。清末赵尔丰虽实行改土归流，但土司制到现在仍然存在。
    二、大汉族主义造成藏汉的隔阂
    历代封建皇朝和国民党反动匪帮对藏族人民传统的高压和奴化政策，藏族人民被赶上荒冷的高原和山地，过着贫穷的生活。清末赵尔丰在金沙江、雅砻江一带的大屠杀，藏族父老到今天谈起来还有余悸。一九三一年国民党反动匪帮焚毁甘孜附近的大金寺、一九三八到一九三九年挑拨的所谓“甘孜事件”，康北的活佛、喇嘛、土司、头人都深深地记在脑海中。“让蛮一寸，不如打蛮一顿。”这一镇压藏族人民血腥的狂吠、“巴安”、“理化”、“瞻化”这类标榜着征服者君临藏族聚居地区所炫耀的县名，都是最易激动藏族人民心情、最易引起反感的。至于封锁茶种、严禁藏区植茶、垄断土产、贸易上的不等价交换，收粮中的大斗、尖斗、踢斗，税目的五花八门等等，藏族人民每一提起，没有不愤慨万分，没有不流泪的。翻一翻替反动统治者说话的档册，不难看出反动统治者千百年来所欠下的一大堆血债。“掉在水里的人，见到一根芦苇，都得抓它一下。”何况世世代代呻吟在血海中的广大藏区人民呢？他们是渴望解除沉重的枷锁的。
    反动统治者种下仇恨的种子既然这样的深，他们再没有地区可以退避了，为了保存他们的种族，为了维护他们本身的利益，他们的怀疑戒备是有理由的。然而历史上大汉族主义者在民族情感上所划的鸿沟今后必须把它填平，藏汉两族人民的隔阂必须消除。康定地区的共产党员和革命工作者已经担负起这一付重的担子，人民解放军进驻康定地区的指战员和人民政府半年来的工作，初步开拓了改善汉藏关系的道路。
    三、正确执行民族政策，团结了藏族各阶层。
    刘文辉将军起义，康定地区和平解放。三月二十四日，人民解放军进驻康定，四月二十八日进驻甘孜。接着，雅江、巴安等县的军事代表先后进行接管工作，康定地区藏族人民所受大汉族主义的压迫从此宣告结束。但是，这并没有解除他们对大汉族主义的痛恨，并没有消灭历史性的民族隔阂。加上匪特和坏分子的造谣污蔑，藏族人民怀疑共产党和人民解放军。喇嘛们问：“解放军将来会不会让信教自由？”土司、头人们问：“会不会让土司存在？”有的说：“解放军是汉人的军队，像天空的云彩，一阵风就刮跑了。”当时从雅安到甘孜的公路还没有修通，后方的粮食不能马上运到。在这种困难情况下，康定地区党、政、军各级工作同志本着“搞好团结、消灭隔阂”的方针，摸稳情况一步，前进一步地进行各项工作。他们严格执行了三大纪律、八项注意，真正做到了尊重藏族人民风俗习惯和不进喇嘛寺，尽管有时得不到粮食，指战员们便拔野菜、打黄鼠来充饥。战士们在行军当中，背着八十多斤重的食粮，越过海拔三千多公尺的二郎山，四千多公尺的折多山，从不拉群众一头牲口。有时找不到住处，便在野外宿营，从不住喇嘛寺。特别是在抢修从雅安到甘孜的公路当中，我工兵部队的指战员，不顾大雨、饥寒、毒蛇和蚂蝗，提前完成这一长达千余公里的干线。这种史无前例的优良的群众纪律，感动了广大藏族人民。他们看到我指战员们吃野菜、吃黄鼠，便自动的将酥油、糌粑送给指战员们。他们说：“国民党反动派三十多年没有做到的，解放军来了不到半年，就做到了（指修公路）。”藏族妇女说：“解放军真是咱们一家人，不拉咱们的牲口，公买公卖，还带咱们挑水割草，咱们从来没有见过这样好的队伍。”
    康定解放后，成立军管会，以藏人夏克刀登、邦达多吉、凭错旺阶等为军管会委员，藏人政治地位提高，都说：“共产党真正讲民族平等，十五名委员，就有八名是藏人。”康定军管会和派驻甘孜、鑪霍、雅江等地的军事代表，重要的行政措施，事先和当地土司、头人、活佛、堪布等协商，征求他们的意见，得到他们同意后，然后施行。因此，取得了各阶层人民、特别是土司、头人、活佛、喇嘛的信任。他们将军事代表看作自己的代表，有什么问题，总找军事代表来解决，他们说：“国民党反动政府的衙门，我们瞧都不敢瞧，现在咱们的军事代表就和咱们一家人一样。”康定县已经召开第一届各族各界代表会议，出席这次会议的二百六十三名代表中，藏族代表九十七名，彝族二十一名，回族八名。通过这次会议，代表们进一步了解了人民政府的各项政策，他们知道公粮的负担比国民党反动统治时期轻得多，且是取之于民，用之于民。因此，他们回到自己的家乡后，到处宣传政府的政策和代表会的情形，荣冠乡保正仁真汪甲开完会回家，上了最好的粮，还号召群众上最好的粮，该乡三天内，就交足了公粮一百八十石。阿泰乡一个保，一次交清全保的粮，他们说：“今年上粮最公道，一次就上清了，没有大斗、尖斗、踢斗等花样。”
    参加人民政府工作的藏族干部，有职有权，意见得到尊重和采纳。象康定军管会主任苗逢澍，天宝委员等朴实的工作作风，诚恳的态度，感动了接触过他们的藏人，他们信心提高，工作积极，象格达活佛和夏克刀登等均大力支援人民解放军。
    由于上述这些工作，使藏族各阶层，特别是上层，团结在人民政府的周围，协助政府的各种工作，使工作得以逐步地展开。
    四、生活“高原化”、“康藏化”
    康藏地处高原，海拔平均三千公尺左右，大米有时不易煮熟，藏民均以牛奶、酥油、糌粑为主要食粮。雅安到甘孜的公路虽已修通，粮食源源运到。为了使生活和藏民打成一片，我进驻甘孜地区某部中共党委会提出生活“高原化”、“康藏化”的口号，号召全体指战员和工作同志喝牛奶，吃酥油、糌粑，打毛袜手套，学藏话。起初，战士们是喝不惯牛奶，吃不惯酥油、糌粑的。有的说：“牛奶是小娃娃喝的，咱三十左右的人，还喝啥牛奶。”有的吃酥油时也咽不下去。经过短时期试验，再试验，大家都习惯了，且喜欢吃酥油、糌粑了。
    生活康藏化、高原化的结果；指战员的身体更加健壮，一个个都长得红胖胖的。由于生活接近藏民，进一步融洽了军民关系。藏族人民说：“解放军真的和咱们是一家人，咱们吃什么，他们也吃什么。”这一收获，说明了生活“高原化”、“康藏化”具体的群众观点，并从实际行动中，更深刻地体现了三大纪律和八项注意。也充分地说明，只有实际行动才能解除历史性的民族隔阂。
    五、初步改善了汉藏关系，这就是成绩。
    甘孜一带的藏族人民，称解放军的指战员和人民政府工作同志为“嘉色巴”（新汉人），认为解放军都是圣人，连肚子里的气都化没有了（意即有修养的人）。这告诉人们，康定地区半年来的工作和藏族人民建立了良好的感情，使他们认识到人民的政权和国民党反动政权本质上的区别。这一成绩的获得，固然是康定地区解放军指战员和人民政府全体工作同志艰苦奋斗的结果，但和西南军政委员会、中共中央西南局、西康省人民政府和中共西康区党委会的领导是分不开的，西南军政委员会刘伯承主席，中共中央西南局邓小平书记经常告诫在少数民族地区的工作同志，切不可犯急性病，要稳步地做，摸稳一步情况，就前进一步。并指示在少数民族地区的工作方针是“搞好团结，消灭隔阂”。西康省人民政府主席兼中共西康区党委会书记廖志高同志遵行了上级的指示，发现某一地区工作上有偏差，立即予以纠正。
    康定地区半年来的工作，充分的证明，政协共同纲领的民族政策是可以而且能够消除历史性的民族隔阂，使各族人民熔为一个大家庭的。
    六、继续学习民族政策，
    康定地区半年来的工作，固然有了一定的成绩，但应该肯定地说：这不过是工作的开端，而消灭历史性的民族隔阂是长期性的，许多新的工作须要“开步走”。半年来的工作经验，应引起今后该地区领导上高度注意的，首先是需要有组织、有计划地进行民族政策的学习，尽管各级干部执行民族政策没有发生大的偏向，但是，少数同志对民族政策仍有模糊和一知半解的，工作上仍有急躁的毛病，如有的战士帮助藏民秋收，看到喇嘛前来要布施，就感到不满。有的同志看到喇嘛寺烧糌粑，便说：“老百姓没有饭吃，你还烧糌粑。”因此，坚持学习民族政策，应成为这一地区工作同志重要的课题。每一工作同志应深深体会邓小平书记指示的：“一百个干部，九十九个做得好，有一干部出乱子，也可以把事情弄坏。”语重心长的警句。
    同时，该区领导上应防止干部中的过左情绪。如某些干部不满政权中有土司、头人，不愿意接近上层等。因此，领导上应对这类同志耐心说服教育，使他们建立为藏族人民服务的长期观点。
    今天，藏族人民的要求是政府所宣布的政策逐步兑现的问题，他们要求区域自治，事实上，康定军管会根据他们的要求准备逐步的作起来了，行将召开的民族协商会议，以及行将产生的自治区人民政府，正是实现藏族人民要求的重要措施。
    康定地区半年来的工作已取得了一定的成绩。今后，在人民政府领导下，只要按照“稳步前进”的方针做下去，我们一定可以看到汉藏关系将日趋融洽，而藏区人民一定会走上繁荣幸福的途径的。
