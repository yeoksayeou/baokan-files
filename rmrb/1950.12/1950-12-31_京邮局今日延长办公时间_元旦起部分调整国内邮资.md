    Beijing Post Office Extends Business Hours Today; Some Domestic Postage Rates to be Adjusted Starting New Year's Day
    To facilitate the public in mailing letters, parcels, and remittances at the end of the year, the Beijing Postal Administration and the Dongsi, Xisi, West Chang'an Street, Bamiantao, Qianmen Street, and Houmen post offices have decided to extend business hours to 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on December 31st (Sunday). Except for the Parcel Division of the Administration, which will take a two-hour break at noon due to tax bureau inspections, all other services will be continuous.
    The Beijing Postal Administration recently received a notice from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications that, starting January 1, 1951, some domestic postage rates will be adjusted as follows: (1) Postage for trade contracts and news manuscripts will be charged according to printed matter rates. That is, 120 yuan per 100 grams for local delivery and 240 yuan for out-of-town delivery. (2) Printed matter, trade contracts, literature for the blind, business circulars (excluding distribution fees), and samples mailed between Yunnan and Xikang provinces and between Yunnan/Xikang and other provinces will be charged double the domestic postage rates. For example, the printed matter rate will increase to 720 yuan per 100 grams.

    京邮局今日延长办公时间  元旦起部分调整国内邮资
    为便利公众在年底交寄信件、包裹及汇兑款项，北京邮政管理局及东四、西四、西长安街、八面槽、前门大街、后门等邮局，决定本月三十一日（星期日），一律增加办公时间自上午九时至下午五时。除管理局包裹股因税局检验关系，中午休息二小时外，其余均连续服务。
    北京邮政管理局近奉邮电部通令，自一九五一年一月一日起，将国内邮资一部分，作如下调整：（一）贸易契及新闻稿件邮费，改按印刷品资例收费。即每重一百公分，本埠收费一二○元，外埠收费二四○元。（二）云南、西康二省之间及滇、康与其他各省之间互寄的印刷品，贸易契、瞽者文件、商务传单（分送费除外）及货样，按国内互寄资例，加两倍收费。例如印刷品增为每百公分七百二十元。
