    After the Disastrous Defeat in the Korean War, the American Generals Displayed Ugly Behavior: MacArthur and Walker Engaged in Mutual Strife and Discord
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 21st] The disastrous defeat of the American invading forces in Korea has thrown its high command into chaos, leading to mutual attacks and infighting. According to a dispatch from the Electric News Agency in Washington on the 18th, Walker, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, had long been vying with MacArthur for the position of supreme commander of the Korean War. The resentment that had existed between Walker and MacArthur for some time was as deep as the resentment between MacArthur and his intelligence chief, General Willoughby. Recently, Walker had requested direct command from the U.S. Department of Defense in Washington, unwilling to be under MacArthur's command any longer. At the same time, U.S. President Truman also received many reports from American commanders in Japan and Korea accusing MacArthur.
    Prior to this, officers of the U.S. Eighth Army had openly attacked MacArthur for the "disgraceful disaster" suffered by the American invading forces in Korea. According to an Associated Press dispatch on November 30th, officers of the U.S. Eighth Army bluntly stated that the Tenth Army Corps "could have been part of the Eighth Army. This would have allowed Walker to directly command all the troops on the Korean battlefield, and the responsibility on the battlefield would have fallen on him." "However, MacArthur did not merge these two forces." "He placed the Tenth Army Corps under the command of Almond, who was previously his Chief of Staff in Tokyo." Therefore, the officers of the Eighth Army indignantly said, "Although Walker has three-star insignia, he is actually only responsible for half of the front line. The other half of the front line is the responsibility of Commander Almond, who has a two-star insignia." "The unified command of these two forces is not in the hands of the field, but in the hands of MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo."

    侵朝战争惨败后美军将领丑态百出
    麦克阿瑟与瓦克互相倾轧不和
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国侵略军在朝鲜的惨败，使它的统帅部内部也陷于混乱而发生了互相攻击与互相倾轧的丑态。据电通社华盛顿十八日电：侵朝美军第八军军长瓦克早就和麦克阿瑟争夺侵朝战争最高指挥官的职位。瓦克和麦克阿瑟之间已存在了好些时候的怨恨，正如同麦克阿瑟与他的情报头子威洛贝将军之间的怨恨同样地深。最近，瓦克曾要求华盛顿的美国国防部直接指挥，而不愿再受麦克阿瑟的指挥。同时，美国总统杜鲁门也接到在日本和朝鲜的美军司令官们许多指责麦克阿瑟的报告。
    在此以前，美第八军的军官们即因侵朝美军“遭到了可耻的灾难”而公开攻击麦克阿瑟。据美联社十一月三十日电透露，美第八军的军官们直言不讳地说：第十兵团本来“可以作为第八军的一部分。这样就可以使瓦克直接指挥朝鲜战场上所有的部队，战场上的责任就可落在他手里。”“但是，麦克阿瑟并没有把这两支部队合并起来”，“他把第十兵团交给阿尔梦德统率，阿尔梦德以前在东京是他的参谋长。”因此，第八军的军官们愤愤不平地说：“虽然瓦克有三星徽章，但实际他了仅负一半战线的责任。另外一半战线的责任却落在二星徽章的司令阿尔梦德身上。”“对于这两支部队的统一指挥权，不是操握在战地方面，而是操在东京的麦克阿瑟总部手里。”
