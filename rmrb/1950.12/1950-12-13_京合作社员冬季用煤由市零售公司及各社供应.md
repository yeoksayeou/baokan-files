To the Editor:

    The suburbs of Beijing have many vegetable gardens, and the production of firewood is very scarce. Residents mainly rely on burning coal for the winter. In previous years, village cooperatives started selling coal long ago, but there is no information about it this year. Suburban farmers are finding this very difficult and hope that a solution can be found soon.

Mr. Wang Tiezheng:

    Your question has been answered by the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative as follows:

    This winter's coal supply for cooperative members is jointly handled by the cooperatives and the retail stores of the Beijing Municipal Retail Company. If your own cooperative does not engage in winter coal business, you can take your membership card to a nearby retail store of the Retail Company to purchase coal, and you will be given a 6% discount off the civilian price.

    京合作社员冬季用煤由市零售公司及各社供应编辑同志：
    京市郊区菜园较多，毛柴出产很缺，主要依燃煤过冬，每年村合作社早已开始售卖，今年尚无信息，不知是什么原因？郊区农民对此甚感困难，希早日设法调济为盼。
                                  读者王铁铮    十一月二十九日王铁铮君：
    你的问题已经北京市供销总社答复如下：
    今年冬季社员燃煤供应工作，是由合作社及北京市零售公司的零售店共同负责。如自己的合作社未经营冬煤业务，可持社员证赴附近零售公司的零售店购煤，按市民价给予百分之六的折扣优待。
