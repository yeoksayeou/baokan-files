Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: American imperialism, which not long ago invaded Korea under the banner of the "United Nations" with great arrogance, is now expressing great dissatisfaction with the "United Nations." The Central News Agency, a communication service of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, revealed in a dispatch from New York on the 23rd the complaints and resentment of its master, American imperialism, towards its servant countries in the United Nations, calling it a "byproduct of the Korean crisis." It is claimed that in the early stages of the Korean War, when its servant countries were cheering for the US aggression in Korea, the US felt that the "United Nations" "demonstrated its strength." "But before long, despite repeated appeals from the United States, many member states of the United Nations did not send troops to Korea. As the number of American casualties increased daily, Americans felt they were stuck in it." "After the setbacks suffered by the UN forces in November, many countries that had been lazily unwilling to support the UN's actions in Korea began clamoring for a 'solution,' disregarding the UN goals for which many Americans had died and suffered hardships in Korea." The dispatch revealed that these countries did not heed the US's instructions to falsely accuse China of being an "aggressor," "but even talked about allowing Communist China to join the United Nations. Instead of supporting the principles of the United Nations Charter, they engaged in compromise and appeasement." The dispatch stated: "What Americans hate most is that while they are almost single-handedly bearing the costs of combat and relief in Korea, other UN member states hardly refute the Communist Party's bizarre propaganda, because the Communist Party is saying that it is the United States, not the United Nations, that is fighting in Korea, and that the United States is the aggressor. What is especially disgusting to Americans is that while their sons are fighting hard against powerful enemy forces in Korea under the name of the United Nations, the United Nations itself is hesitant." American imperialism, which has always regarded the United Nations as a tool for its aggression, is now being ridiculed in this way, and is therefore "increasingly dissatisfied with the United Nations" and "disappointed with the United Nations." This kind of complaint was expressed very bluntly by Lodge and Sparkman, two members of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly. According to a dispatch from United Press International, Washington, on the 25th, Lodge said: "The biggest danger and weakness in the United Nations lies in the fact that member states do not contribute manpower in proportion to their population." Lodge also said, "If the United Nations passes a resolution against aggression, but it only means allowing us to use our own manpower, then even if the United Nations passes this resolution by a vote of 54 to 5, it would not be a victory." Therefore, Lodge demanded: "If there is a UN obligation, then all UN member states should contribute manpower in proportion to their population." Sparkman criticized "other countries for not being so prepared for military expeditions in Korea." He self-deprecatingly said: "There is a lot of truth in saying that the Korean War is an American effort, not a United Nations effort." However, how much effect these complaints and accusations can produce remains a question. According to sources from Lake Success, the United States is now "not sure" that it can get two-thirds of the UN representatives to jointly accuse China of being an "aggressor," and it "will be more difficult to obtain the necessary support" for imposing diplomatic and economic sanctions on China. The source pointed out: "All discussions may prove to be just empty talk, and the development of the Korean battlefield will determine the future evolution."

### 美帝国主义埋怨“联合国”

    美帝国主义埋怨“联合国”
    【新华社二十八日讯】不久以前打着“联合国”旗帜、趾高气扬地侵略朝鲜的美帝国主义，现在却对“联合国”大表不满了。国民党残余匪帮的通讯社中央社纽约二十三日电透露了它主子美帝国主义对联合国中其仆从国家的埋怨和愤懑，称之为“因朝鲜危机而生的一个副产品。”据称：在侵朝战争初期，当它的仆从国家为美国侵略朝鲜而摇旗呐喊时，美国感到“联合国”“表现了它的力量”。“但为时不久，美国虽一再呼吁，但很多联合国会员国并不派兵赴朝鲜。而美军死伤人数日增，美国人觉得他们已身陷其中。”“在联军遭受十一月间的挫势后，一直懒洋洋地不愿支持联合国对朝鲜行动的许多国家，开始嚷着要求‘解决’，不顾许多美国人为之在朝鲜战死并饱受艰辛的联合国目标。”该电透露，这些国家没有听从美国的吩咐，把中国诬称“侵略者”，“反而甚至在说什么准许共产党中国参加联合国一类的话。她们不支持联合国宪章原则，反而大干其妥协并进行姑息”。该电称：“美国人最恨的是他们几乎在一手担负朝境作战和救济的费用之时，其他联合国会员国几乎丝毫不去驳斥共产党的离奇宣传，因为共产党在说在朝鲜作战的是美国而不是联合国，而美国乃是侵略者，尤其使美国人厌恶的是，当他们的子弟在联合国名义下在朝鲜对强大敌方兵力艰苦作战时，联合国本身却犹豫不定。”一向把联合国当作它进行侵略的工具的美帝国主义，现在遭到如此奚落，因而“对联合国日渐增加不满”，“对联合国失望”。这种埋怨在美国驻联合国大会代表团的两个团员洛奇和斯巴克曼的嘴里说得很露骨。据合众社华盛顿二十五日电，洛奇说：“联合国内最大危险和弱点在于：会员国不按照它们人口的比例拿出人力来。”洛奇又说“假使联合国通过反对侵略的决议案只是意味着允许我们使用我们自己的人力的话，那末，纵令联合国以五十四票对五票通过这个决议案，也不见得就是胜利。”因此，洛奇要求：“假若有联合国义务存在的话，那末所有联合国会员国便应该按照其人口比例拿出人力来。”斯巴克曼责难“其他国家对于在朝鲜进行军事远征没有那么有准备”。他聊自解嘲地说：“说朝鲜战争是美国的努力而不是联合国的努力，是有很多真理的。”但是，这些埋怨、责骂究竟能产生多少效果，依然是一个问题。据成功湖方面人士透露：美国现在“毫无把握”使联合国的三分之二的代表联合诬指中国为“侵略者”，如对中国施以外交和经济制裁“将更难获得必需的支持”。该方面人士指出：“一切讨论可能都证明只是空谈，朝鲜战场的发展将决定未来的演变”。
