    "Party Membership Card"
    Imperialism is unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history automatically. After defeat, it still uses despicable means to exploit loopholes, sow discord, sabotage, murder, and plot, in a vain attempt to prolong its dying breath.
    "Party Membership Card" depicts such an incident. Through this film, we can see that the enemy wants to exploit loopholes at all times and use vicious means to destroy us. A special agent like Kuganov comes from a landlord class background, and his origin determines his thinking, making him a consistently counter-revolutionary criminal. He accepts the instructions of his masters, pretends to be active and brave in order to gain the trust of the people, and even uses self-inflicted injuries to deceive the Party organization in order to carry out his counter-revolutionary activities of assassinating revolutionary elements and sabotaging construction. He is not satisfied with this; he also wants to betray the motherland in exchange for personal gain. Shameless people like Pavel existed during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and we will still encounter them today and tomorrow. This is because our enemies, U.S. imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are still struggling, trying to salvage their mortal crisis, and have not been completely eliminated. Today, as we resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we must maintain the highest vigilance against these reactionary dregs, not giving them any opportunity to exploit, and preventing them from carrying out their tricks. We must use the highest vigilance to protect our vital forces and ensure our construction work and lasting world peace. (Jiang Ling)

    《党证》
    帝国主义是不肯自动退出历史舞台的，失败之后它还要运用卑鄙的手段钻空子、挑拨离间、破坏、杀害、阴谋，以妄想苟延残喘。
    《党证》就是描写这样的事故。通过这部电影我们可以知道敌人时时刻刻想钻空子，用毒辣的手段破坏我们。像特务库干诺夫是地主阶级出身的人，他的出身决定了他的思想，使他成为一个一贯反革命的凶犯。他接受了他主子的指示，伪装积极勇敢，以取得人民的信任，更不惜用苦肉计哄骗党组织，以进行他暗杀革命分子、破坏建设的反革命勾当。他还不以此为满足，还要叛卖祖国，以换取个人的私利。像派维尔这种无耻之徒，在抗日战争和解放战争中发现过存在过，在今天、明天我们将仍会遇得到。这是因为我们的敌人美帝和蒋匪帮残余还正挣扎，企图挽回死亡危机，还没有被彻底消灭掉。这些反动滓渣，在抗美援朝的今天我们更要时刻以最高的警惕，不给他空子钻，让他无法施其伎俩。我们必须用最高的警惕保卫我们的有生力量，保障我们的建设工作与世界的永久和平。       （江岭）
