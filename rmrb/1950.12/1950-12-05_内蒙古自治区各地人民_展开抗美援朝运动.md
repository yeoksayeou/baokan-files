Xinhua News Agency, November 30th—People in various regions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have launched practical actions to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country.

Korean farmers residing in the Korean Gacha (village) of Najinu Nuutuk (district), Arong Banner, Hulunbuir League, have expressed their willingness to volunteer to go to Korea to fight against the U.S. aggressors. They said: Our fellow countrymen are struggling hard to defend the independence and freedom of the Korean nation. We cannot stand idly by. We must do our best to help them drive the American bandits out of Korea.

In Jirem League, Hinggan League, and other places, people from all walks of life have launched a current affairs study movement. People's organizations such as the Democratic Women's Federation and the Communist Youth League in Jirem League have held forums and lectures on current affairs to oppose U.S. aggression. Residents of Jiangjia Street, Xing'an Town Gacha (village), Baladain Nuutuk (district), Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan League, held a current affairs forum. At the meeting, everyone recalled with tears the tragic situation when the Japanese devils ruled this place, unanimously denounced the U.S. imperialists' atrocities in expanding their aggression against Korea, and resolved to do everything in their power to smash the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy of aggression.

Factories in Ulanhot launched a patriotic production competition to respond to the challenge from Zhao Guoyou's team. After launching the production competition, the quality of products in the Xinsheng Tannery in the city has been improving day by day. After workers in the shoe-making department of the factory automatically regrouped and rationally divided labor according to their technical conditions, the average number of shoes made per person per day now exceeds more than double what it was in the past.

In rural areas, farmers actively paid public grain to enhance the strength of the motherland. Farmers in Baolin Village, Tenth District, Tuquan County, repaired fifteen miles of grain transport roads to ensure that public grain could be transported to warehouses quickly. Xirgen Zala Gacha (village), Durji Nuutuk (district), Horqin Right Central Banner, has prepared ninety-six carts to transport public grain. Farmers in Huade and Baochang counties, Chahar League, are transporting grain to warehouses overnight, having transported 490,000 catties of public grain in two days.
