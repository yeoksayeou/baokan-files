    Dedicated to Russian Women
    By M. Isakovsky, translated by Qiu Qin and Liu Guangjie
    ...It's truly hard for us to sing of
    The times you lived through!
    What a heavy burden
    Weighed on the shoulders of women!
    Your husband, perhaps your son, or your brother,
    Bid you farewell that morning,
    And you were left with your fate—
    Utterly alone.
    You greeted this war—
    With tears, facing
    The unharvested grain in the fields.
    Sadness, toil, and anxiety
    Constantly tormented you alone—
    Without end.
    You alone—whether willing or not
    Had to measure up in every way;
    At home and in the fields, it was always you alone,
    You sang alone, you wept alone.

    The clouds grew lower and lower,
    The thunder rumbled closer,
    Often the news that came—was all bad.
    But you, before the entire nation,
    Before the war,
    Showed what a Russian woman you were. (Note)
    You embraced your sorrow,
    Walking the harsh road of labor.
    You fed the entire front with your own grain—
    From one coast to the other.
    In the bitter winter, in the snow and wind,
    On that distant border line,
    The clothes you carefully sewed
    Warmed the soldiers.

    In the explosions, in the smoke,
    Soviet soldiers plunged into battle.
    The bombs you made by hand
    Demolished the enemy's fortresses.
    You did everything, without fear,
    You were like the one in the saying,
    Spinning and weaving,
    You could use a saw and a needle.

    You chopped wood, you transported grain, you tilled the fields,
    How can your hardships be fully described?
    Yet, you wrote letters to the front—
    Making them believe as if you lived very well.
    The soldiers at the front,
    Reading your letters,
    They clearly knew:
    This was your sacred lie.

    Those soldiers who were ready for battle,
    And about to plunge into the fight,
    They seemed to be praying, or making a vow—
    Whispering your distant name...

    (Postscript) This poem was written during the Soviet Great Patriotic War: Translated from the author's collection of poems "Poems and Songs", the popular edition of the Soviet State Art Literature Publishing House, 1948.
    (Note) The correct translation of the original sentence should be "You were that kind of person."

    献给俄罗斯妇女
    Ｍ·伊萨可夫斯基作  丘琴  刘光杰合译
    ……我们实在难以说唱
    你们生活在怎样的年光！
    那是多么沉重的负担
    压在妇女们的肩上！
    你的丈夫，也许是儿子，或是兄弟，
    在那一天清晨告别了你，
    你就同自己的命运留下——
    孤零零地一个人。
    你迎接了这次战争——
    落着泪，面对着
    田野中还没有收割的粮食。
    悲伤，劳累和焦虑
    不断地向你一人煎迫——
    永无休止。
    你一个人——不管愿意或是不愿意
    在各方面都要向人家看齐；
    在家中，又在田里，总是你孤身一个，
    你独自歌唱，独自哭泣。
    乌云越来越低，
    雷声更近地响起，
    常常传来的——都是些不好的消息。
    但是，你却在全国之前
    在战争面前，
    表现了你是一个怎样的俄罗斯妇女。（注）
    你怀抱着你的愁苦，
    走着那严峻的劳动的道路。
    你用自己的粮食喂养着全部战线——
    从这一海岸到那一海岸。
    在严寒的冬季，在风雪里，
    在那辽远的边线上，
    你细心缝制的外衣
    温暖着兵士。
    在爆炸声中，在烟雾里，
    苏维埃战士投身战斗中去。
    你手造的炸弹
    轰毁了敌人的堡垒。
    你做着一切，毫不畏惧，
    你仿佛俗话中
    纺线的人，又是织布的人，
    你会使锯，也会用针。
    你劈柴，你运粮，你种田，
    你的辛苦那能数说得完？
    可是，你却写信寄给前线——
    使他们相信好像你生活得很美满。
    战士们在前方，
    读着你的信札，
    他们清楚地知道：
    这是你的神圣的谎话。
    那做好战斗准备，
    并正将投身搏击的战士们，
    他们仿佛在祝祷，又像是在宣誓——
    轻声叨念着你远方的名字……
    （附记）这首诗写于苏联伟大卫国战争时期：译自作者诗集《诗与歌》，一九四八年苏联国家艺术文学出版局的普及版。
    （注）原句正确译文应为“你是你那样的一个人”。
