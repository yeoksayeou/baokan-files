How to Run Winter Schools This Year?
　　Li Shushen
　　(1) The Situation of Winter Schools Last Year
　　The experience of old liberated areas over the years has proved that winter school is an important way to promote farmers' spare-time education.
　　Last year's winter schools, in the old areas where land reform had been completed, generally focused on cultural learning. Farmers showed enthusiastic and positive emotions toward cultural learning. According to incomplete statistics from North China, Northeast China, East China, Northwest China, Central South China, and Inner Mongolia, a total of 213,481 winter schools were established last year, attracting nearly 12 million farmers to participate in learning. Generally, students recognized about 200 characters; some learned 400 to 500 characters and could keep accounts, write notes and simple letters; some even learned around 1,000 characters and could write simple meeting minutes. In addition, through winter schools, various regions effectively publicized government policies and decrees, assisted in completing local central tasks, promoted production, and advanced maternal and child health work. It also played a certain role in raising farmers' awareness and disseminating scientific and health knowledge.
　　In view of the importance of regular learning, some regions planned to cultivate typical examples, absorb experience, and transform seasonal winter schools into year-round farmer's spare-time schools (hereinafter referred to as people's schools) during last year's winter school, creating models. According to incomplete statistics, this spring, 65,713 winter schools were transformed into people's schools, with 3,485,036 people persisting in year-round learning. This is a new phenomenon in farmer education, a manifestation of farmers' urgent desire to turn over culturally after turning over politically and economically.
　　Due to the development of various work aspects in the past year, especially the good harvest this autumn, this year's winter school can not only be expanded more widely in the old areas on the basis of last year's winter school and the people's school since this spring, but also some areas in the new areas have the conditions to carry out winter school due to land reform, rent reduction, and interest reduction. Therefore, it can be predicted that the demand for cultural learning among farmers will become more enthusiastic this winter, the scale of winter school will exceed previous years, and the role and gains of winter school will also be greater than last year.
　　(2) Problems in This Year's Winter School
　　Regarding farmer's spare-time education, the Central Ministry of Education made important principled instructions at the Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference held in September this year. However, in the past two or three months, the situation has undergone new developments. Because of the US imperialist aggression against Korea and our country's Taiwan, our country's security is seriously threatened. Patriotic compatriots in various regions have widely launched a vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. Under this situation, how should this year's winter school be run?
　　In terms of guiding principles, this year's winter school should still implement the principles determined by the Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference on farmer education, but it must consciously and systematically strengthen the current affairs political education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and defending our country.
　　The six most important points pointed out by the Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference regarding farmer education are still applicable to this year's winter school:
　　First, the focus should be on village and township cadres and young activists, and gradually extended to ordinary farmers. Strive to enable rural cadres and young activists to learn more than 1,000 commonly used characters within three to five years and have basic literacy and numeracy skills. Second, the content should generally focus on cultural learning, with literacy education as the focus, and appropriately combine political education, production technology, and health education. Third, adapt to local conditions, proceed steadily, consolidate development, prevent coercion and commandism, and overcome formalism. Fourth, the learning time and organizational forms of learning should be diverse and flexible according to specific conditions, and uniformity should not be forced. Fifth, the work, teachers, and funding of farmer education should all implement the mass line. Education work should be done as mass work; the principle of people educating people should be implemented in terms of teachers; and funding should rely on mobilizing farmers to solve it themselves, with the government implementing key subsidies and rewards. Sixth, in terms of organizational leadership, implement the principle of government leadership, relying on various mass organizations and multi-faceted cooperation, and set up special institutions or personnel in government cultural and educational departments to strengthen leadership.
　　The reason why this year's winter school should generally still focus on cultural learning and promote the literacy movement is primarily because literacy and cultural learning are necessary conditions for improving political awareness, production technology, and labor productivity. The vast majority of farmers in our country are still illiterate. If farmers do not first learn to read and master learning tools and acquire basic literacy and numeracy skills, it will be impossible to systematically improve politically, impossible to systematically absorb advanced scientific knowledge and technology, and impossible to develop the country's agricultural production along scientific lines. Literacy and cultural learning are the basic problems of farmer education in the current and future historical periods, and are one of the important steps to transform our country from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Secondly, literacy and cultural learning are the urgent demands of farmers in the old areas where land reform has been completed and farmers' lives have been initially improved. The production in these areas has either approached the pre-war level or even exceeded it. Except for individual disaster areas, the days of half-grain with chaff and vegetables are over. The vast majority of farmers are living a life free from worry about food and clothing. This economic situation has created a demand for cultural learning among farmers. The enthusiastic learning of farmers in last year's winter school and the people's school since this spring is proof of this. This year, farmers' economic situation has further improved, and the demand for cultural learning will inevitably become more enthusiastic. Moreover, literacy and cultural learning already have ideological and organizational foundations among farmers in the old areas. The improvement of farmers' economic lives not only provides material conditions for learning, but also has been fully prepared ideologically, and has various forms of organization, such as scattered literacy classes (groups), kang-head groups, small teachers delivering lessons to the door, and centralized year-round people's schools. We should and must consolidate these learning organizations. We should enable these farmers who have already been organized in learning to continue to move forward, and we should make possible developments on the basis of winter schools and people's schools to mobilize more farmers to participate in learning. Finally, from the current situation, literacy and cultural learning are entirely possible. The current situation is different from the period of the Anti-Japanese War and the Self-Defense War. Farmers are not in the enemy's rear like in the past, with frequent and cruel wars, and constantly engaging in direct, tense, and sharp struggles against the enemy. Now that the country has basically been unified, farmers' literacy and cultural learning is a step to promote rural production and should be one of the specific contents of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. As long as the environment permits and the conditions are possible, it should be adhered to and implemented.
　　The reason why this year's winter school should still focus on village and township cadres and young activists is because farmer education work must be gradually promoted with a focus, from scratch, from less to more, and from points to areas. The focus of rural objects should naturally first be village and township cadres and activists. The so-called village and township cadres and activists refer to cadres of village and township political power and people's organizations, as well as rural Communist Party members, Youth League members, production models, labor heroes, and other model personnel. Most of these people have devoted themselves to the revolution for many years, but due to various reasons, they have not had the opportunity to learn culture, so that the vast majority of them are still illiterate. They have unlimited enthusiasm for serving the people, but due to a lack of culture, they feel difficult and very painful about the increasingly complex work, and they urgently need to learn to read and write and master learning tools. "Cadres are the advanced elements among the masses," "Serving the cadres also means serving the masses entirely, because only through the cadres can the masses be educated and guided." Providing these people with education so that they gradually have basic literacy and numeracy skills and correctly understand the current situation can better play a leading role in all work and more effectively educate and lead the masses to advance together.
　　The reason why this year's winter school should still advance steadily and develop firmly is because "the serious problem lies in educating the farmers." We must fully recognize the importance, arduousness, and long-term nature of farmer education. Focusing on actual results, rather than simply pursuing figures, winter schools must be real and effective. Building one good winter school is what counts. The so-called consolidated development requires first of all restoring and consolidating the winter schools that were well-run last year, making them move forward further. Secondly, villages and townships that did not run well last year or did not run at all but have the conditions to run this year should run them, and strengthen leadership to ensure they are run well. Thirdly, those villages and townships that did not run last year and still lack the conditions to run well this year can temporarily not run. The practice of "coming in a swarm" and then "dispersing in a swarm" is not right. At the same time, we should carefully study the various aspects of the year-round people's school, the existing problems, and the lessons learned, summarize them, consolidate achievements, promote advantages, overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, and rectify errors to improve the work. Finally, according to the existing experience of people's schools, we should strive to transform winter schools that have the conditions to be transformed into people's schools next spring as much as possible. In this year's winter school, we should carry out ideological, organizational, and work preparations for transforming into people's schools. This steady advancement, gradual development, and gradual reduction of illiteracy will achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy.
　　The reason why this year's winter school should still adapt to local conditions is because our country is a large country with vast territory and complex situations, and political, economic, and cultural development is extremely uneven, and historical and natural conditions are different. Farmer education must, under the overall guidelines, formulate specific implementation guidelines and steps according to different regions (such as old areas, semi-old areas, new areas, ethnic minority areas, disaster areas), different situations, different work foundations, different central work and tasks, and different mass situations and awareness levels, and stipulate different requirements, contents, and methods. For example, semi-old areas and new areas should absorb the experience of winter schools in the old areas, combine with local conditions, combine with current central work such as rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, anti-hegemony and bandit suppression, combine with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, adopt various forms, and carry out farmer's current affairs, political, and policy education. Only when farmers demand and conditions permit, should literacy education be appropriately promoted. In ethnic minority areas, in addition to taking different approaches depending on whether they are new or old areas, and conducting education in their native languages, special attention should be paid to the education of ethnic policies and other necessary and possible education should be conducted in light of the economic situation of local ethnic characteristics and society.
　　Regarding learning time, learning organization forms, teacher funding, and leadership issues, the principles put forward by the Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference are the long-term experience of farmer education and should be implemented.
　　(3) Combine Winter School with the Movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country
　　In addition to generally adhering to the above-mentioned guidelines, this year's winter school must consciously and systematically strengthen the current affairs political education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Not only should this education be strengthened among farmers participating in winter schools and people's schools, but this education should also be universally carried out among the majority or all farmers who have not yet been organized. This point is very necessary and must not be ignored.
　　Resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and defending our country is the general requirement of all the people in our country at present, and it is the main task of the current political struggle. At present, the imperialist war-mongers, in the war of aggression against Korea, although they have suffered a decisive defeat under the blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they not only have no intention of repenting, but have intensified their efforts to accelerate the preparation for a new war, openly claiming to continue their aggression against Korea, insisting on armed occupation of Taiwan, and continuing to prevent our country from entering the United Nations. This shows that the imperialists are unwilling to accept the victory of the Chinese people. We must not relax our struggle because we have won a victory, but must continue to work harder and make more resolute struggles. Therefore, we must further organize the strength of the Chinese people, use more active actions to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and stop aggression. We must deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea into the countryside and develop it among the farmers.
　　Farmers in our country account for about 80% of the population. Farmers have contributed a great deal to the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China for nearly 30 years.
　　A large-scale movement of farmer's current affairs political propaganda and education must be launched in rural areas. Its target is not only limited to farmers participating in winter schools, but also includes all the masses in rural areas. Its requirement is to enable farmers to correctly understand the ambition and facts of US imperialist aggression, the essence of US imperialists, the relationship between resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and defending our country, strengthen their love for the motherland and the people, and establish the idea of ​​hating, despising, and disdaining US imperialism, make them aware of the greatness of the power of the Chinese people and the world peace camp, eliminate the psychology of fearing the United States, and establish confidence in victory.
　　Current affairs political education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is a broad and long-term patriotic mass education work, and it is a very arduous task in rural areas. The following points should be noted when carrying out this work:
　　First, it should be closely combined with the local masses' political tasks, such as preventing traitors and spies, crushing rumors, suppressing the activities of counter-revolutionary elements such as reactionary societies, and positive aspects such as strengthening production, doing a good job of militia, and consolidating public security. We must make the masses realize that these are also practical work to support the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and improve the masses' political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm through these tasks.
　　Second, winter schools, people's schools, literacy classes, and groups should be used as important bases for carrying out current affairs political education, because through these existing learning organizations of farmers, the education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea can be carried out continuously and more systematically, and therefore it is also the most effective form.
　　Third, in addition to the already organized farmers' learning organizations, all possible forces of all government agencies, organizations, and schools should be mobilized in cooperation with relevant departments, through various systems, various local organizations, and using all opportunities and occasions such as various mass gatherings or going to farmers' homes, adopt various methods such as slide shows, cartoons, dramas, singing, Yangko dances, magic lanterns, blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasting, etc., to conduct extensive mass propaganda. In the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival, rural cultural and recreational activities centered on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea should be planned to expand the influence of this propaganda and education. When conducting this current affairs education, we should strive for brevity and popularization, and avoid empty or monotonous preaching.
　　Fourth, we should oppose the phenomenon of one-sidedly emphasizing cultural learning and neglecting current affairs political education, or not paying enough attention to it; we should also oppose the bias of only caring about current affairs political education, relaxing or abandoning cultural learning, or not paying attention to restoring, consolidating, and developing farmer's learning organizations under possible conditions.
　　Fifth, winter school must be closely combined with the current affairs political education movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country. First of all, all regions should, according to the situation and conditions of the region, weigh the priorities, and appropriately stipulate the proportion of cultural learning and current affairs political learning in winter schools under the principle of strengthening current affairs political education to resist US aggression and aid Korea. For example, in border areas in Northeast China that are close to Korea, the proportion of current affairs political learning should be larger. Winter schools in various regions should expand the scope of students when conducting current affairs education, and try to mobilize farmers who have not participated in winter schools to attend lectures or participate in discussions.
　　Secondly, local farmer education work departments should cooperate with local relevant propaganda and publishing agencies and organizations to compile and print supplementary literacy textbooks and farmer's reading materials with the content of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as the center, and supply them to winter schools and people's schools in various regions, so that cultural learning and current affairs education can be more closely combined. Also provide current affairs political education materials as continuously as possible, and strive to systematize the materials so that current affairs political education can be gradually deepened and sustained.
　　Thirdly, the teachers for current affairs education must be carefully selected and controlled. Only mass teachers with higher political awareness, excellent primary school teachers, or village cadres capable of taking on the responsibility can serve as teachers for current affairs education. Before class, it is best to have the leaders discuss and study the main points of the education content. It is necessary to strictly prevent the phenomenon of failing to grasp the main points, distorting the content, or taking the opportunity to carry out reactionary propaganda with ulterior motives when conducting current affairs political education.
　　At the same time, leadership over winter schools must be strengthened. Grasp the leadership of winter school teachers, and select mass teachers with better grades, higher awareness, teaching experience, and achievements as the backbone, so that they can take on the task of helping mass teachers in certain villages and townships. Rural primary school teachers should also take on the responsibility of providing professional guidance to mass teachers in certain villages and townships. The county can select winter schools with moderate locations and good work foundations as base points, taking the district as the unit, to hold regular meetings or transmission stations, and assign full-time cadres to be responsible for the area, to systematically and specifically help the backbone of mass teachers and the primary school teachers participating in the work of winter schools, helping them prepare courses, impart current affairs political education content, collect information and feedback, hold teaching research meetings, organize observation teaching, or hold typical reports, etc. The experience of various places proves that the selection of such a backbone, the establishment of stations, and the assignment of full-time cadres are completely necessary. It is the determining factor for organizing, educating, guiding, and improving mass teachers, and thus also improving the learning effect of farmers. It is an important bridge for realizing the combination of leadership and the masses, and the combination of external forces and farmers themselves. The experience of various places proves: if this is not done, farmers' current affairs political learning will easily fall into the old routine, be boring, and formalistic; farmers' cultural learning will also have little effect or be spontaneous or unsustainable. In addition, grasping the station can connect the points of the winter school, and grasp the surface, so this is also an effective method of combining points and surfaces.
　　Finally, the number of people adhering to year-round learning in farmer's spare-time schools in various regions as previously planned should still be used as the goal for developing farmer's spare-time education in various regions. Except for the Northeast, which can make necessary reductions according to specific circumstances, various regions should strive to complete the task.

    今年冬学怎样办？
    李曙森
    （一）去年冬学情况
    老解放区历年来的经验证明，冬学是推行农民业余教育的一种重要方式。
    去年的冬学，在土改已完成的老区，一般都以文化学习为主。对于文化学习，农民都表现了热烈积极的情绪。据华北、东北、华东、西北、中南、内蒙等几个地区不完整统计，去年共办了冬学二十一万三千四百八十一处，吸收了近一千二百万农民参加学习。一般学生都认识了二百字左右；有的学会了四、五百字，能记帐，写便条与简单书信；有的甚至学会千字上下，能写会议简单记录。此外，通过冬学，各地还有效地宣传了政府的政策法令，协助完成了当地中心任务，推动了生产，推进了妇婴卫生工作。对提高农民觉悟，传播科学与卫生知识，也起了一定作用。
    鉴于经常性学习的重要，某些地区在去年冬学中曾有计划地培养典型，吸取经验，把季节性的冬学转为常年学习的农民业余学校（以下简称民校），创造了范例。据不完整的统计，今春即有六万五千七百一十三处冬学转为民校，计有三百四十八万五千零三十六人坚持着常年学习。这是农民教育的新气象，是农民在政治上经济上翻身后迫切要求在文化上翻身的表现。
    由于一年来各方面工作的发展，特别是今秋收成较好，今年冬学，不仅老区各地，可在去年冬学及今春以来民校的基础上更广泛地展开，而且新区也因土改、减租、减息有不少地方具备了开展冬学的条件。所以可以预料，今冬农民学习文化的要求将愈显得热烈，冬学的规模将超过往年，冬学的作用与收获亦将较去年为大。
    （二）今年冬学中的问题
    关于农民业余教育，今年九月，中央教育部所召开的工农教育会议曾作了重要的原则指示。但二、三个月以来，时局有了新的发展，因美帝侵略朝鲜和我国台湾，严重威胁我国安全，我各地爱国同胞，广泛掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动。在这种形势下，今年冬学究竟应该怎样办？
    就方针说，今年冬学，仍应贯彻工农教育会议关于农民教育所决定的原则，但必须有意识有计划地加强抗美援朝保家卫国的时事政治教育。
    关于农民教育，工农教育会议所指出的最主要的六点，对今年冬学仍是适用的：
    第一，对象重点放在村屯干部及青年积极分子上，逐渐推广到一般农民。争取在三、五年内使农村干部及青年积极分子学会常用字一千以上，并具有初步读写算的能力。第二，内容一般的以文化学习为主，以识字教育为重点，并适当结合政治教育生产技术与卫生教育。第三，因时因地制宜、稳步前进，巩固地发展，防止强迫命令，克服形式主义。第四，学习时间与学习的组织形式应根据具体条件，多种多样，灵活运用，不能强求一律。第五，农民教育工作及师资与经费问题都应执行群众路线。教育工作应当作群众工作去作；师资问题上应贯彻以民教民的方针；经费则依靠发动农民自行解决，政府实行重点补助与奖励。第六，组织领导上实行政府领导，依靠各群众团体，多方面配合的原则，并在政府文教部门中设专门机构或人员以加强领导。
    今年冬学一般的所以仍应以文化学习为主，推行识字运动，首先因为识字学文化是提高政治觉悟、生产技术和劳动生产率的必要条件。我国农民绝大多数还是文盲，如果农民不首先识字掌握学习工具，获得读写算的基本能力，就不可能作到政治上有系统的提高，不可能有系统地吸取先进的科学知识与技术，就不可能使祖国农业生产沿着科学方面发展。识字学文化是当前与今后一定历史时期农民教育的基本问题，是使我国从农业国走向工业国的重要步骤之一。其次识字学文化是土改已完成、农民生活已初步改善的老区农民的迫切要求。这些地区的生产，有的接近恢复战前水平，有的甚至超过战前水平，除个别灾区外，糠菜半年粮的日子已成过去，广大农民过着不愁吃穿的生活，这种经济生活情况就使农民产生了学文化的要求，去年冬学及今春以来民校农民积极学习的情况就是明证。今年农民经济情况又进一步上升，对文化学习的要求必然更趋热烈。而且识字学文化在老区农民中已有了思想的与组织的基础。农民经济生活的改善，不仅提供了学习的物质条件，而且思想上已有了较充分的酝酿，组织上已有了多种多样的形式，如分散形式的识字班（组）、炕头小组小先生送上门等，及集中形式的常年民校。这些学习组织，我们应该而且必须把它们巩固起来。我们应该使这些从学习上已组织起来的农民继续前进，我们并应在冬学和民校基础上作可能的发展，动员更多的农民参加学习。最后，从当前的形势看来，识字学文化还是完全可能的。目前情况不同于抗日战争与自卫战争时期，农民不是像过去似的处于敌后，战争频繁残酷，经常对敌展开直接紧张尖锐的斗争。现在是全国已基本上统一，农民识字学文化，是促进农村生产的一个步骤，应该是抗美援朝的具体内容之一，只要环境允许，条件可能，就该坚持与贯彻下去。
    今年冬学对象所以仍应着重村屯干部、青年积极分子，这是因为农民教育工作必须有重点地逐步推广，从无到有，由少到多，自点到面。农村对象重点，自然首先应是村屯干部积极分子，所谓村屯干部积极分子是指村屯政权与村屯各人民团体的干部及农村共产党员、青年团员、生产模范、劳动英雄与其它模范人员。这些人多半多年献身革命，因种种原因，没有机会学习文化，以致至今绝大多数还是文盲。他们为人民服务有无限热情，但因缺乏文化，对当前日渐复杂的工作，感到困难，十分痛苦，迫切要求识字学文化，掌握学习工具。“干部是群众中的先进分子”，“为干部，也完全是为群众，因为只有经过干部，才能教育群众指导群众”，给这些人以教育，使之逐步具有读写算的基本能力，正确地认识当前形势，就可以更好地在一切工作中发挥带头作用，更有效地教育群众并率领群众一同前进。
    今年冬学所以仍应稳步前进，巩固地发展，这是因为“严重的问题在教育农民”。我们必须充分认识农民教育的重要性、艰苦性与长期性。从实际效果上着眼，而不应单纯追求数目字，冬学必须有名有实，办好一处是一处。所谓巩固地发展，首先须把去年办得好的冬学恢复起来，加以巩固，使其更前进一步。其次去年办得不够好或没有办而今年有条件办的村屯，要办起来，并加强领导，保证办好。第三那些去年没有办，今年也还缺乏条件可以办好的村屯，则暂时可不办，“一哄而来”又“一哄而散”的作法，是不对的。同时要把常年民校的各方面工作，现存问题与经验教训，好好研究，加以总结，以巩固成绩，发扬优点，克服困难，纠正缺点，改正错误，把工作提高一步。最后，应该根据已有民校经验，争取明春有条件转为民校的冬学，尽量转为民校。今年冬学中就应进行转民校的思想上、组织上及工作上的准备。这样稳步前进，逐步发展，逐渐减少文盲，才能达到消灭文盲的目的。
    今年冬学所以仍应因时因地制宜，这是因为我国是个大国，幅员辽阔，情况复杂，政治、经济、文化发展极不平衡，历史条件自然条件各不相同。农民教育必须在总的方针下，根据不同地区（如老区、半老区、新区、少数民族地区、灾区）不同情况，不同工作基础，不同中心工作与任务，不同群众情况与觉悟程度，分别制定具体实施方针与步骤，规定不同的要求内容与办法。如半老区、新区，就该吸收老区冬学经验，根据当地情况，结合当前中心工作如减租减息，土改，反霸剿匪，结合抗美援朝运动，采用各种形式，开展农民的时事、政治、政策教育，只在农民要求与条件许可下，才适当地推行识字教育。又如少数民族地区，除应根据新区或老区分别采取不同方针，并用本族文字进行教育外，还应特别注意民族政策的教育及针对当地民族特点与社会的经济的情况进行其他必要与可能的教育。
    关于学习时间，学习组织形式，师资经费及领导问题，工农教育会议所提出的原则都是农民教育的多年经验，应该贯彻下去。
    （三）把冬学与抗美援朝保家卫国运动结合起来
    今年冬学除一般的坚持上述方针外，必须有意识、有计划地加强抗美援朝的时事政治教育。不仅在参加冬学和民校的农民中应该加强此种教育，即在尚没有组织的多数或全体农民中亦应普遍展开此种教育。此点十分必要，决不能忽视。
    抗美援朝保家卫国是当前我国全体人民总的要求，是当前政治斗争的主要任务。目前帝国主义战争贩子们，在侵朝战争中，虽在朝鲜人民军与我国人民志愿军打击下，已遭受决定性的失败，但他们不仅毫无悔祸之心，且反变本加厉，更加速地进行新战争的准备，公开声称要继续侵略朝鲜，坚持武装侵占台湾，继续阻止我国进入联合国。这说明了帝国主义者对中国人民的胜利，是决不肯甘心的。我们决不能因已得胜利而放松斗争，必须再接再厉，作更坚决的斗争。因此必须进一步组织中国人民的力量，用更积极的行动，抗美援朝，制止侵略，必须把抗美援朝运动深入到农村中去，在农民中开展起来。
    我国农民几占人口百分之八十，对于近三十年来，在中国共产党领导下的中国人民革命斗争，农民出的力量是非常大的。
    必须在农村展开一种规模巨大的农民时事政治宣传教育运动，它的对象，不仅限于参加冬学的农民，并且包括农村中一切群众。它的要求，是使农民能正确认识美帝国主义侵略的野心和事实，美帝国主义者的本质，抗美援朝与保家卫国的关系，加强他们爱祖国、爱人民的观念，和树立仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想，使他们认识中国人民与世界和平阵营力量的伟大，肃清恐美的心理，确立胜利信心。
    抗美援朝的时事政治教育是一种广泛和较长期的爱国主义的群众教育工作，在农村又是很艰巨的任务。进行此一工作时，应注意下列各点：
    第一，应与当地群众的政治任务密切结合起来，如防奸反特，粉碎谣言，镇压反动会门等反革命分子的活动以及积极方面如加强生产，搞好民兵，巩固治安等工作。要使群众认识这些也都是支持抗美援朝运动的实际工作，并从这些工作中间去提高群众的政治觉悟与爱国热情。
    第二，应以冬学、民校、识字班、组等作为进行时事政治教育的重要据点，因为通过农民已有的这些学习组织，是使抗美援朝的教育能持续地并较有系统地进行，因而也是最有效的一种形式。
    第三，除通过农民已有学习组织外，应配合有关部门动员一切机关团体、学校可能的力量，通过各个系统、各种地方组织，利用一切机会与场合如各种群众性集会或去农民家庭中间，采用多种方式如幻灯、漫画、戏剧、歌咏、秧歌、拉洋片、黑板报、屋顶广播等进行广泛的群众宣传，在即将到来的新年春节中，尤应有计划地布置以抗美援朝为中心内容的农村文娱活动，以扩大这种宣传教育的影响。进行这种时事教育时，应力求简要通俗，避免空洞或单调的说教。
    第四，应该反对片面的强调文化学习，而忽视时事政治教育，或重视不够的现象；也应反对只顾时事政治教育，放松或放弃文化学习，或不注意去恢复、巩固及在可能条件下发展农民学习组织的偏向。
    第五，冬学必须与抗美援朝保家卫国时事政治教育运动密切结合起来。首先，各地应根据地区情况与条件，权衡轻重缓急，在加强抗美援朝时事政治教育原则下，适当地规定冬学中文化学习与时事政治学习的比重。如东北接近朝鲜的边沿地区，时事政治学习的比重就应大些。各地冬学在进行时事教育时应扩大学员范围，尽量动员未参加冬学的农民去听讲或参加讨论。
    其次，各地农民教育工作部门，应配合当地有关宣传和出版机关团体，编印以抗美援朝保家卫国为中心内容的补充识字教材和农民读物，供给各地冬学与民校，以便使文化学习与时事教育更密切结合起来，并应尽可能不断地供给时事政治教育材料，且力求材料系统化，以便使时事政治教育有可能逐步深入持续地进行下去。
    再次，须慎重地选择与掌握时事教育的师资，必须政治觉悟较高的群众教师，优秀的小学教职员或有能力担任的村干部才能作时事教育的教员。上课前最好有领导的对教育内容要点加以讨论研究。应严防进行时事政治教育中抓不住要点，曲解内容，或别有用心乘机进行反动宣传的现象。
    同时，必须加强对冬学的领导。抓紧冬学教师的领导，可选择群众教师程度较好，觉悟较高，教学有经验，有成绩者为骨干，使其担负帮助一定村屯群众教师的任务。农村小学教职员也应担负给一定村屯群众教师以业务上指导的责任。县可以区为单位选择地点适中，工作基础较好的冬学为基点，作定期开会或传授的站所，并指派专职干部，按地区负责，有计划的巡回到站，有系统地具体地帮助群众教师的骨干及参加冬学工作的小学教职员，帮助他们准备课程，传授时事政治教育内容，收集情况与反映，召开教学研究会，组织观摩教学或举行典型报告等。这种骨干的选定，站所的建立及专职干部的指派，各地经验证明是完全必要的，它是组织、教育、指导与提高群众教师，因而也是提高农民学习效果的决定因素，是实现领导与群众结合，外力与农民自己结合的重要桥梁，各地经验证明：如果不这样作，则农民的时事政治学习就易陷于老一套，枯燥无味，形式主义；农民的文化学习，也会效果不大或自流或不能坚持下去。另外抓紧站所就可以联系冬学的点，而掌握了面，所以这又是点面结合的有效办法。
    最后，前所拟定之各地区农民业余学校坚持常年学习的人数，仍应作为各地发展农民业余教育的目标，除东北可根据具体情形酌予必要的减少外，各地均应努力争取完成任务。
