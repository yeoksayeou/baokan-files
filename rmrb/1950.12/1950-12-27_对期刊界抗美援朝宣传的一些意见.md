Regarding the propaganda situation of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" movement in the journal world, we collected 147 kinds of journals and made a preliminary investigation (we mainly looked at the journals in October and November, and not many in December); although these 147 kinds of journals only account for about half of the total number of journals in the country, they include the more important national, local, and various types of journals.

In terms of total volume, taking the total length of the 147 journals published in October and November as 100, the propaganda text for Resisting America and Aiding Korea accounts for about 16 percent. Separated by category: comprehensive current affairs account for 35.5 percent (that is, taking the total length of 42 issues of 14 comprehensive current affairs journals as 100, the text for Resisting America and Aiding Korea accounts for 35.5 percent), youth account for 30 percent, popular account for 19 percent, finance and economics account for 14 percent, children account for 13 percent, science and technology account for 12 percent, women account for 11 percent, literature and art account for 11 percent, education accounts for 10 percent, and religion accounts for 0.1 percent. Among the 147 journals, 28 journals accounted for more than 20 percent of the total length of the Resisting America and Aiding Korea propaganda text; 41 accounted for less than 20 percent; and 78 had none at all. Among the 78 journals with no Resisting America and Aiding Korea propaganda text at all, religion accounted for 11 (out of 13 in this category), science and technology accounted for 27 (out of 34 in this category), education accounted for 17 (out of 23 in this category), and finance and economics accounted for 12 (out of 18 in this category). Comparing October and November, comprehensive current affairs increased from 26 percent in October to more than 45 percent in November; youth increased from 18 percent in October to 42 percent in November; women increased from 13 percent in October to 21 percent in November; children remained the same in November as in October. Science and technology increased from 6.7 percent in October to 18 percent in November, and popular increased from 12.3 percent in October to 25.7 percent in November.

According to the above statistics, although not entirely complete and accurate, we can see the following situations. First, in terms of various types of journals, most of them have done propaganda for Resisting America and Aiding Korea; second, from the perspective of development, November increased compared to October. These two situations reflect that the national journal publishing community has used its strength to participate in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea to defend the country, and has shouldered the responsibility of patriotic propaganda. However, third, this propaganda work is unbalanced. That is to say, some have done it, some have not, and the proportion of those who have not done it still accounts for more than 50 percent of the total. Secondly, among the comprehensive current affairs journals that have done the most, some have increased the weight of this propaganda work to 63 percent of the total length (such as "World Knowledge"), but there are also four that have not done it at all. It is commendable that there is no case of not doing it at all in the popular and children's categories.

From the editorial work, we have seen the following situations.

In terms of advantages, the first is that some publications have played a great guiding and leading role, such as "Current Affairs Handbook", "World Knowledge", "Study", and "Outlook" in the comprehensive current affairs category. They grasped the propaganda of Resisting America and Aiding Korea very early, and it is carried out regularly; some of the articles have strong guiding significance. "Current Affairs Handbook" was produced in the upsurge of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. From the first issue, it continuously published guiding articles on this aspect, such as "Why the Chinese People Cannot Ignore the US Expansion of the War of Aggression Against Korea" and "How to Understand the United States". "World Knowledge" regularly analyzes the development of the Korean situation, exposing the aggressiveness and weakness of US imperialism from an economic and diplomatic perspective. "Study" published the full text of Premier Zhou's report "Strive to Consolidate and Develop the Victory of the People" in the second issue of the third volume published on October 16th, and published a commentary on "Seriously Study Premier Zhou's Speech", calling on people to study Premier Zhou's report in conjunction with current affairs. With the development of the situation, in the next issue, it published an editorial "We Must Study Current Affairs Issues" and a special article "US Imperialism Can Be Defeated". "Outlook" published a considerable amount of current affairs propaganda text against US imperialism very early. In the youth category, "Democratic Youth" published in Dalian is the best. On the 111th issue published on October 1st, it combined the Korean situation and called on Northeast youth to "love the motherland and defend the motherland", and pointed out sharply that the US imperialists "have always been robbers!"

The second is that some publications have well combined the actual situation and the target audience. In the finance and economics category, such as "Industry and Commerce Weekly" (published in Harbin) and "Shanghai Industry and Commerce Information", they can combine the Resisting America and Aiding Korea movement with either taxation work or the task of developing production. In the science and technology category, such as "China Tobacco" has "Accusation of US Imperialist Tobacco's Crimes of Aggression Against China" and "Investigation Report on British and American Tobacco Trusts in China", which are good examples of combining specialized journals with political movements. In the popular category, such as "New Rural Village" published in the Northeast, it especially emphasizes anti-American special agents, anti-rumor and eliminating traitors, and exposing the history of US imperialist aggression against our country's conspiracies; in the propaganda text of anti-special agents, anti-rumors, and eliminating traitors, it also puts forward work methods, which are specific and practical, and suitable for the needs of rural work. In the education category, such as "New Sports" published in Beijing has an article "The Truth About the American Sports World", exposing the true face of the American bourgeois commercialized sports world. Another example is "New Elementary School" published in Nantong, which has articles such as "How to Carry out Education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea in School Children", which are also examples of publicizing Resisting America and Aiding Korea from the perspective of reality.

But there are also shortcomings. First, insufficient attention or complete neglect. Among the thirteen religious journals seen, only the third issue of the first volume of "Modern Buddhism" published in Beijing has a speech by Vice Minister Chen Qiyuan, and the third issue of the eleventh volume of "Fu You Bao" published in Shanghai has two articles that touch on current affairs, and the rest do not mention the issue of Resisting America and Aiding Korea at all. In the literature and art category, such as "Shandong Literature and Art" only has two document-like things in November, and there is not a single text that reflects this vivid theme in artistic form; another example is that "Northwest Literature and Art" and "Hebei Literature and Art" have no propaganda in November; "Yangtze River Literature and Art" only has one text talking about defending peace. These are all organs of literary and artistic activities that lead a province or a large administrative region. In the science category, such as the "Science Bulletin", a reading material for natural scientists published in Beijing, only has a document-like declaration, and it is also ranked in an unimportant position. In the youth category, "Progressive Youth" only had two temporarily added texts in November. In the popular category, "Worker Culture" published in Tianjin had a column against US imperialism in August and September, which was originally very good, but in October and November it disappeared, and a special issue was published again in December.

(2) Lack of strong guidance and poor integration with reality. National journals, such as the national workers' publication "Chinese Workers", are relatively poor in terms of guidance, organizational role, and leading role in the propaganda of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. There was no such text in October, and in November there was only a declaration from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and a text calling on seafarers to oppose the US imperialists, and no other guiding things. In the review and resolution documents of the editorial work published in November, the issue of current affairs education was not mentioned, which shows that this national workers' mouthpiece does not pay enough attention to current affairs education. "Chinese Young Pioneers" is also a national organ publication. Only two of the four issues published in October and November carried out this work with very little space. Even in these spaces, they did not well combine children's lives and use various forms to express this issue. Women's publications generally have too little propaganda text, and the texts published are mostly general in nature, and there is even a lack of texts that can be combined with women's lives (this type of text is only available in individual women's publications in December).

After analyzing the reflection and organization of the journal publishing community in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we would like to put forward a few hopes to the journal community:

1. We should attach great importance to the propaganda work in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea to defend the country. Journals are powerful propaganda weapons between newspapers and books, and each journal has a certain large readership; it shoulders an important propaganda task. From a statistical point of view, among the 147 journals, 78 did not pay attention to the issue of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, which is related to the future of the Chinese people and the people of the world, which is unacceptable. Of course, there are objective difficulties in the editorial work of some publications, such as not being able to find manuscripts, or not having time to publish them, etc., but if there is enough attention to this issue, such difficulties should be overcome.

2. National journals must assume or better assume a guiding role. For example, the editorial policy of "Study" from October (that is, the second issue of the third volume) with its editorials or special articles that are rich in guidance is very necessary. Various magazines should strive to play an organizational role, targeting their specific readers. For example, if the organ publications of the provincial federations of literary and art circles can carry out general anti-imperialist and patriotic propaganda in artistic form on the one hand; on the other hand, guide and organize the actual activities of literary and art workers, and reflect these activities in the publications, it will be able to better combine with the masses and guide the masses.

3. The patriotic movement against US imperialism is a relatively long-term movement, so there should be long-term plans in the editorial plan. Each journal should vigorously prepare for soliciting manuscripts, and be good at combining with reality, grasping different readers (those who do well in this regard, such as the examples cited above, are only a very few), reflecting flexibly from different angles and in different forms, coordinating with the development of current affairs, adapting to the situation and reader requirements, and gradually improving the level of propaganda. This is a very important task. We hope that journal publishers, journal editors and writers will keep in touch, discuss carefully, and carry out the plan according to the results of the discussion.

    对期刊界抗美援朝宣传的一些意见
    齐康
    为了了解期刊界对“抗美援朝”的宣传情形，我们搜集了一百四十七种期刊，作了一番初步的考察（我们看的主要是十、十一两月份的期刊，十二月份的看到的还不多）；这一百四十七种期刊虽然约只占着全国期刊总数的一半，但是全国性的、地方性的、各种不同性质的比较重要的期刊，都已包罗在内了。
    就总量来说，以十月和十一月出版的一百四十七种期刊的全部篇幅为一百，抗美援朝的宣传文字约占百分之十六的篇幅。按类别分开来说：综合时事类占百分之三十五点五（即以综合时事类期刊十四种四十二期全部篇幅为一百，抗美援朝文字占百分之三十五点五），青年类占百分之三十，通俗类占百分之十九，财经类占百分之十四，少年儿童类占百分之十三，科学技术类占百分之十二，妇女类占百分之十一，文艺类占百分之十一，教育类占百分之十，宗教类占百分之零点一。在一百四十七种期刊中，抗美援朝宣传文字占各该类总篇幅百分之二十以上者计二十八种；占百分之二十以下者，计四十一种；完全没有的，计七十八种。在完全没有抗美援朝宣传文字的七十八种期刊中，宗教占十一种（该类共十三种），科学技术占二十七种（该类共三十四种），教育占十七种（该类共二十三种），财经类占十二种（该类共十八种）。如果拿十月份和十一月份来比较，综合时事类在十月份是百分之二十六，到十一月份增至百分之四十五强；青年类在十月份是百分之十八，到十一月份增至百分之四十二；妇女类在十月份是百分之十三，到十一月份增至百分之二十一；少年儿童类十一月和十月相同。科学技术类在十月份是百分之六点七，到十一月份增至百分之十八，通俗类在十月份是百分之十二点三，到十一月份增至百分之二十五点七。
    根据上述统计数字，虽不十分完全，不十分精确，但已经可以看出下面几种情况。第一，就各种类的期刊说，一般的都作了抗美援朝的宣传；第二，从发展上看，十一月份比十月份增加了。这两种情形反映了全国期刊出版界以他们的力量参加了抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，并负起了爱国主义的宣传的责任了。但是，第三，这一宣传工作是不平衡的。这就是说，有的做了，有的还没有做，而且没有做的其比例还占总数百分之五十以上。其次，在做得最多的综合时事类期刊中，有的把这一宣传工作的分量提高到占总篇幅的百分之六十三（如“世界知识”），但其中也还有四种完全没有做。值得称许的是在通俗和少年儿童类中完全没有不做的情形。
    从编辑工作上，我们看出了下述一些情况。
    在优点方面，第一是有的刊物发挥了很大的指导性和带头作用，如综合时事类中的“时事手册”、“世界知识”、“学习”、“展望”等，在时间上掌握抗美援朝的宣传都很早，而且是经常进行的；其中有些文章且具有较强的指导性。“时事手册”是在抗美援朝的热潮中产生的，从第一期起，就连续不断的发表了有关这方面的指导性的文章，如“为什么我国人民对于美国扩大侵朝战争不能置之不理”“怎样认识美国”等。“世界知识”经常分析朝鲜局势的发展，从经济的和外交的本质上揭露美帝国主义的侵略性和弱点。“学习”在十月十六日出版的三卷二期中于刊载周总理的“为巩固和发展人民的胜利而奋斗”报告全文的同时，发表了“认真学习周总理的演说”的评论，号召结合时事学习周总理的报告。随着时局的发展，在次一期又发表了“必须学习目前时事问题”的社论和“美帝国主义是可以被战胜的”专论。“展望”很早就以相当篇幅刊载反美帝国主义的时事宣传文字。在青年类中，旅大出版的“民主青年”是最好的，在十月一日出版的一一一期上就结合了朝鲜局势，号召东北青年“热爱祖国，保卫祖国”，并尖锐的指出美帝“它从来就是强盗！”
    第二是有些刊物很好的结合了实际和结合了读者对象。在财经类中，如“工商周报”（哈尔滨出版的）和“上海工商资料”，都能将抗美援朝运动或和税务工作或和发展生产任务结合起来。在科学技术类中，如“中国烟草”有“控诉美帝烟草侵华罪行”、“英美在华烟草托辣斯调查报告书”，这是善于将专门性的期刊来结合于政治运动的好例子。在通俗类中，如东北出版的“新农村”，特别着重抗美反特、反谣除奸和暴露美帝侵略我国的阴谋史实；在反特、反谣、除奸的宣传文字中并提出了工作办法，具体而实际，适合农村工作的需要。在教育类中，如北京出版的“新体育”有“美国体育界真相”一文，揭露美国资产阶级商业化的体育界的真面目。又如南通出版的“新小学”有“在学校少年儿童中如何开展抗美援朝的教育”等文，也是善于从实际出发宣传抗美援朝的例子。
    但缺点也是有的。第一、重视得不够或竟完全忽视了的。在宗教类所见到的十三种期刊中，只有北京出版的“现代佛学”一卷三期有一篇陈其瑗副部长的讲演和上海出版的“福幼报”十一卷三期有两篇文章是接触时事的，其余完全没有谈到抗美援朝这个问题。在文艺类中，如“山东文艺”在十一月份中仅有两篇文件性的东西，而用文艺形式来反映这一生动题材的文字一篇也没有；又如“西北文艺”、“河北文艺”在十一月份中都无只字的宣传；“长江文艺”仅有一篇谈保卫和平的文字。这些都是领导一个省份或一个大行政区的文艺活动的机关刊物。在科学类中，如北京出版的自然科学家的读物“科学通报”只有一篇文件性的宣言，而且还排在不重要的地位上。在青年类中“进步青年”在十一月份才有两篇临时加进去的文字。在通俗类中，天津出版的“工人文化”，在八九月份中有反对美帝一栏，原是很好的，但，到十、十一月份反倒没有了，到十二月份又出了专号。
    （二）指导性不强，结合实际很差的。属于全国性的期刊，对于抗美援朝的宣传，在指导性、组织作用和带头作用等方面比较差的，如全国性工人刊物“中国工人”，在十月份没有这类文字，十一月份只有一篇全总的宣言，和一篇号召海员反对美帝的文字，再没有其他指导性的东西。在十一月份中刊载的编辑工作检讨和决议文件中，也没有提到时事教育问题，这说明这个全国性的工人言论机关刊物对时事教育工作重视得不够。“中国少年儿童”也是全国性的机关刊物，十、十一两月份出版的四期中只有两期以很少的一点篇幅进行了这一工作，就是在这些篇幅中，也没有很好地结合儿童生活用多种形式来表现这一问题。妇女类的刊物，宣传文字一般的已经嫌少，而所刊登的文字也多为泛论性质的，能够结合妇女生活来写的更其缺乏（十二月份个别的妇女刊物上才有这一类文字）。
    分析了期刊出版界对抗美援朝这一运动的反映和组织情况后，我们要向期刊界提出几点希望：
    一、应该高度重视抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的宣传工作。期刊是介乎报纸和书籍之间的有力的宣传武器，每一期刊都拥有它一定的广大的读者；它担负着重要的宣传任务。就统计来看。一百四十七种期刊中，竟有七十八种没有注意到这个关系到中国人民和世界人民前途的抗美援朝问题，这是不该有的现象。固然，这在某些刊物编辑工作中有着客观上的困难，例如找不到稿子，或来不及刊登等等，但如果对这问题有足够的重视的话，这样的困难应该是可以克服的。
    二、全国性的期刊一定要负起或更好的负起指导作用，如像“学习”从十月份（即三卷二期）以来的几期的社论或专论那样富有指导性的编辑方针，是非常必要的。各种杂志均应力求针对其特定的读者对象，起组织的作用。例如各省文联的机关刊物，如果能够一面以艺术形式作一般的反帝和爱国主义的宣传；一面更指导和组织文艺工作者的实际活动，并把这些活动反映到刊物上，这就能够更好的结合群众，指导群众。
    三、反对美帝国主义的爱国运动是一个比较长期的运动，因此，在编辑计划上应有长期打算。每种期刊应该大力地去进行组稿的准备工作，并善于结合实际，抓紧不同的读者对象（这方面做得好的，如前面所举出的例子，只是极少数），从不同角度，用不同形式来灵活的反映，配合时事的发展，适应时局和读者要求，把宣传水平逐步提高。这是非常重要的工作，我们希望期刊出版家、期刊编辑者和著作家们经常联系，仔细商讨，并且按照讨论的结果，有计划的去进行。
