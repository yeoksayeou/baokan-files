Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 17th: The winter clothing fundraising campaign in the Southwest Region has successfully concluded. As of December 12th, the entire region has raised a total of 51.7 billion yuan in lieu of winter clothing, exceeding the original target (500,000 sets of winter clothing, equivalent to 25 billion yuan) by more than double. During the fundraising campaign, the people of the Southwest Region demonstrated a high degree of mutual aid and fraternal spirit, enthusiastically donating. Government agency cadres and officers and soldiers in the military universally tightened their belts, donating their allowances and a portion of their food expenses, some even donating half a year's savings. Workers at factories in Nanchong County, Northern Sichuan, originally planned to donate 100 sets of winter clothing, but ended up donating 180 sets. Industrialists and businessmen in various regions also made significant contributions to the winter clothing fundraising campaign.

    劝募寒衣任务
    西南超额完成
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南区的寒衣劝募运动已胜利结束。截至十二月十二日止，全区共已募得寒衣代金五百一十七亿元，比原规定任务（寒衣五十万套，折合代金二百五十亿元）超过一倍以上。劝募运动中，西南区人民发挥了高度的互助友爱精神，热烈展开捐献。政府机关干部和部队中的干部、战士，更普遍节衣缩食，捐出他们的津贴和一部分伙食费，有的甚至捐出了半年的积蓄。川北南充县各工厂工人原来预定捐献寒衣一百套，结果却捐出了一百八十套。各地工商业者在寒衣劝募运动中也出了很大的力量。
