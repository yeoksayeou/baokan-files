	*White-Clad Warrior*
	Movie Promotion Month Good Movie Introduction
	China has had thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters who contributed their life's strength during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. Battle heroes emerged in combat, labor models in mines, and countless outstanding figures in every work position.
	Here, special mention should be made of the glory of the medical workers of the People's Liberation Army. The movie *White-Clad Warrior* recounts how a medical worker, through the full display of patriotism and revolutionary humanitarianism, steadfastly and correctly takes on the task of defending the country. Captain Zhuang in *White-Clad Warrior* is not only a medical worker who bravely fights for justice, but also a good soldier in the People's Liberation Army. She not only fearlessly takes on the task of rescuing the wounded and healing the dying amidst enemy fire, but also forgets her own illnesses and everything else, enabling the soldiers to quickly recover their health and return to the front lines. Furthermore, she can unite all the wounded soldiers, using her own active actions and facts of loving the motherland and the people to educate every wounded soldier, improve the comrades' awareness, and strengthen the comrades' fighting will.
	After watching *White-Clad Warrior*, we must learn from the heroic models. Our medical workers, all our working cadres, must learn from Captain Zhuang in the film.

    《白衣战士》
    电影宣传月好电影介绍
    中国有过千千万万优秀儿女，在抗日战争和解放战争中贡献出了毕生的力量，在战斗中出现着战斗英雄，在矿厂里，有着劳动模范，在每一个工作岗位上，都有着无数的杰出人物。
    这里特别要说到的是人民解放军医务工作者们的光荣，电影《白衣战士》就是记述了一个医务工作者在爱国主义和革命的人道主义精神的充分发挥中，坚强和正确地担任起保家卫国的工作。《白衣战士》庄队长，她不单是一个为正义而勇敢战斗的医务工作者，她也是一个人民解放军中的好战士；她不单在敌人炮火中奋不顾身地担负救死扶伤的任务，她并且忘记了自己的病痛和一切，使战士很快的回复健康而重上前线；她更能团结所有伤员，用自己爱祖国、爱人民的积极行动与事实，教育着每一个伤员，提高了同志们的觉悟，加强了同志们的战斗意志。
    我们看了《白衣战士》要向英雄模范学习，我们的医务工作者们，我们的一切工作干部们，更要向影片里的庄队长学习。
