    The National Industrial and Commercial Circles Mobilize and Strive to Complete the Work of Revaluing Property and Adjusting Capital!
    Wu Xianmei
    The Measures for Private Enterprises to Revalue Property and Adjust Capital have been promulgated and implemented by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. This is a major event that the national industrial and commercial circles have been looking forward to for a long time. If private enterprises can do a good job in revaluing property and adjusting capital, it will be of great help to the improvement and development of their own businesses. It will also inevitably make a good contribution to adjusting public-private relations, labor-capital relations, especially in rewarding investment.
    (1) Why revalue property and adjust capital? This is because the hyperinflation caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government over the years has caused the book value of private enterprises to differ greatly from the actual value, and the figures in the accounts are completely unreliable. As a result, the following three effects have occurred: (1) Due to the changes in the monetary system over the years, the book capital of private enterprises has been out of touch with the actual value after multiple conversions. The original capital of one million silver dollars may now be recorded as less than one cent on the books. This is a very common and extremely unreasonable thing. Investors do not know how much their investment in the enterprise is worth, so shares cannot be freely transferred, and the enterprise itself cannot absorb new investment. The person in charge of the enterprise cannot calculate reasonable profits based on incorrect property values. Even if there are profits, it is difficult to distribute them reasonably because of the continued depreciation of the currency and the lack of a definite amount of capital. The above situation is enough to affect investors' interest in the enterprise, and even cause disputes between investors and the enterprise. Also, because fixed assets cannot be depreciated at full value, the enterprise's own ability to replace fixed assets will be reduced. Therefore, failure to revalue property and adjust capital will make everyone unwilling to invest in the enterprise, which will seriously affect the existence and development of the enterprise. (2) The result of hyperinflation will inevitably cause enterprises to generate huge amounts of fictitious profits when closing accounts. If goods worth one yuan increase to ten yuan by the end of the year, the gross profit on the books will be nine yuan. If taxes are levied according to this fictitious profit, it will become a case of shifting the capital to make profits and levying taxes on fictitious profits, which will weaken the foundation of private enterprises and violate the principle of reasonable burden. After liberation, although many regions have allowed calculating profits based on price changes, it is still difficult to accurately calculate profits because the property has not been accurately valued and the methods vary from place to place. On the contrary, in the past under the rule of the reactionary government, making false accounts was quite common in order to avoid levying taxes on fictitious profits. Now that we can no longer continue to allow making false accounts and illegally evading taxes, we must use the method of revaluing property and adjusting capital to eliminate this accumulated practice. Also, when public and private parties engage in transactions, private enterprises cannot calculate legal profits because the amount of capital is incorrect, and cannot depreciate reasonable depreciation because the value of fixed assets is incorrect, so it is extremely difficult to calculate costs correctly. Therefore, failure to revalue property and adjust capital will affect public-private relations. (3) When private enterprises close their accounts and generate fictitious profits, disputes can easily arise in employee profit sharing or bonus distribution due to the fictitious profits. Therefore, failure to revalue property and adjust capital may also affect labor-capital relations. In short, if private enterprises cannot have correct and truthful accounts, it will be difficult to improve management and implement economic accounting. The interests of the original investors will not be protected, and it will be difficult for new investors to participate. The restoration and development of private enterprises will therefore be greatly hindered. This is why it is necessary to revalue property and adjust capital.
    (2) Why can we now carry out the work of revaluing property and adjusting capital? During the rule of the reactionary government, although the industrial and commercial circles repeatedly requested adjusting capital during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was never agreed to. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, although a set of measures for revaluing the value of fixed assets and adjusting capital in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises was formulated, it was limited to fixed assets, used the national average price index as a standard, and had to be halved. It was completely self-deception and divorced from reality. Moreover, with the continued hyperinflation, even if the revaluation had some correctness at that time, it would immediately be lost. Therefore, price stability is a prerequisite for doing this. Since the unification of financial and economic work in March this year, financial revenue and expenditure have tended to be balanced, ending more than ten years of hyperinflation. The value of currency and prices have basically stabilized, which provides the prerequisites for revaluing property and adjusting capital. Therefore, this matter was discussed at the May meeting of industrial and commercial bureau directors and the June meeting of tax bureau directors, and it was considered necessary to handle it as soon as possible. It was decided to handle it by the end of this year, so that it can be combined with the usual annual closing of accounts, saving the troublesome procedure of inventorying property. At the same time, the government also noted that since last year, major cities have in fact successively revalued property at different times using various different accounting units (such as Renminbi, real value units, various grains, cloth, silver dollars, etc.). Therefore, unified measures should be formulated as soon as possible so that the results of the revaluation of property can be used as a reliable basis for adjusting capital, and distributing dividends and levying taxes.
    (3) What are the characteristics of the measures for revaluing property and adjusting capital? These measures were drafted in November this year by the Central Private Enterprise Bureau in conjunction with the General Taxation Bureau, and representatives from the industrial and commercial bureaus, tax bureaus, and federations of industry and commerce in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and accounting experts were invited to conduct detailed discussions. They were then approved by the plenary meeting of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. There are several characteristics of the measures that can be pointed out.
    First, these measures are principled and flexible at the same time, such as:
    (1) The measures stipulate that private enterprises in all regions of the country should revalue all property and adjust their capital amount after completing the usual annual settlement for the year 1950 on December 31. However, in order to take care of certain cities that have special difficulties and cannot hold it, they may be approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Great Administrative Region to postpone the holding.
    (2) Although the revaluation of property stipulates that the local current price on December 31, 1950 shall be the standard for valuation, when certain commodity prices have abnormal fluctuations and cannot be based on December 31, a reasonable price can be agreed upon by the local review committee as the valuation standard.
    (3) The deadline for completing the revaluation of property and adjusting capital is generally set as June 30, 1951. However, for the two tasks of revaluation of property and adjustment of capital, how to stipulate the deadline for each task within six months, and when there are special difficulties that require appropriate extension of the processing period, can be decided by the local industrial and commercial administrative organs.
    (4) The measures stipulate that private enterprises should revalue property and adjust capital. However, for shops in small cities and towns and private enterprises in large cities and counties with a very small business scope and no accounting ability, the local review committee may approve exemption from property revaluation.
    The above regulations are all based on the fact that my country has a vast territory, the number of industrial and commercial households in large and small cities is different, the types of private enterprises are diverse, the scale is very different, the U.S. imperialism is carrying out military aggression and economic blockade against us, some areas were liberated later, or have other special tasks, and local government agencies and industrial and commercial organizations feel that they are not sufficiently staffed in terms of manpower and organization, or have special and serious circumstances that they do not have time to bear this task, so they cannot but be realistic and make some flexible regulations. For example, due to the particularly tense work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the Northeast region, the central government has allowed it to temporarily not be carried out universally.
    Second, these measures adhere to the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and fully taking care of the actual difficulties of industrialists and businessmen, such as:
    (1) Because the hyperinflation of the reactionary government in the past forced many private enterprises to make false accounts, and the property on the books is not true. We recognize this historical fact, but now that the currency value and prices have stabilized, continuing to make false accounts is not only not allowed by the government, but the industrial and commercial circles themselves are also suffering from it and urgently seeking a solution. Therefore, the measures stipulate that the revalued property must be the actual property on December 31, 1950. All property that is indeed owned by the enterprise but has not been recorded in the accounts shall be inventoried, valued, and sorted into the accounts.
    (2) The valuation of inventory is stipulated to be based on the price list agreed upon by the same industry. This price list cannot but be uniformly evaluated by the local review committee to represent the correct price at that time and place. However, in terms of the customary inventory price at the time of closing accounts, private enterprises generally set it lower than the market price. This prudent habit should be appropriately taken care of. Therefore, private enterprises are allowed to appropriately underestimate when they value themselves compared to the standard of the price list agreed upon by the same industry, and then submit it to the review committee for review and approval. However, if the valuation exceeds the standard and is overestimated, it will affect the safety of the enterprise itself, which is not allowed.
    (3) We believe that the increase in value after the revaluation of property is the book increase in value caused by hyperinflation and cannot be regarded as profit; therefore, special care is taken to stipulate that industrial and commercial income tax will not be levied. At the same time, it is also stipulated that except for offsetting losses, it shall not be regarded as profit distribution, so as not to weaken the foundation of the enterprise. As for the income tax for 1950, it will still be levied in accordance with the Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax and its relevant regulations; because the income tax for 1950 and this revaluation of property and adjustment of capital are completely two different things and cannot be confused.
    Third, these measures treat the revaluation of property and adjustment of capital as the industrialists' and businessmen's own business, and mainly carry it out through the trade association using democratic consultation methods, such as:
    (1) The standard for inventory valuation is first agreed upon by the industry itself. We firmly believe that a reasonable price will be generated through democratic consultation by the trade association, and there is no need for the government to rigidly stipulate it.
    (2) Regarding the revaluation of property and adjustment of capital, there was an opinion to first carry out the revaluation of property, believing that there are many difficulties in adjusting capital and it is easy to cause various disputes. However, we know that the industrial and commercial circles unanimously believe that the revaluation of property and adjustment of capital must be held at the same time. If the capital is not determined, there will be no standard for distributing dividends and bonuses, and it will be even more difficult to carry out capital increase. As for the method of adjusting capital, under the unified principles stipulated by the government, investors and enterprise leaders can discuss and resolve it themselves.
    (3) The increase in value of revalued property should be transferred to capital and public reserve. No rigid regulations have been made on the ratio of these two. Because enterprises were founded at different times, the situation of whether there are public reserves and how much is different, and the ratio of changes in capital and public reserves is also different due to changes in the monetary system, so it can only be stipulated that the person in charge of the enterprise shall formulate it by themselves in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and with reference to the amount of paid-in capital in the past and the current business and financial situation. Some investors in certain enterprises may advocate increasing capital and reducing public reserves in the hope of obtaining more shares and dividends; however, on the part of the person in charge of the enterprise, in order to ensure the stability and development of the enterprise, they will definitely want to propose an appropriate public reserve. The contradiction between investors and enterprise leaders will definitely be unified through democratic consultation, and the ratio of capital to public reserve will be determined. This ratio must be sufficient to encourage private investment while taking into account the consolidation of the enterprise's foundation.
    In addition, the valuation standards for various properties such as inventory, fixed assets, accounts receivable, assets, gold and silver foreign exchange and foreign assets, securities and investments, intangible assets, deferred assets, and liabilities have been carefully studied and have reasonable and detailed regulations, which will surely be welcomed by the industrial and commercial circles.
    (4) How should the national industrial and commercial circles do a good job in revaluing property and adjusting capital? In October this year, the Second First Session of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress passed a proposal by 32 representatives of the industrial and commercial circles, including Xu Yongzuo and Hu Juewen, suggesting that the central government promptly promulgate measures for revaluing the value of property and adjusting capital in profit-making enterprises. Now that these measures have been fully adopted by the government, the national industrial and commercial circles should assist the local industrial and commercial administrative organs in doing a good job in revaluing property and adjusting capital. To do this work well, first of all, the industrial and commercial circles must have a clear understanding of the significance of this work. The local federations of industry and commerce and trade associations must take the completion of this work as one of the central tasks for the coming year, do a good job in widespread and in-depth publicity, so that every industrial and commercial person understands that this is a matter related to their own interests, and everyone can take the initiative, actively and without any worries to complete this work.
    Secondly, the industrial and commercial circles must mobilize the whole body in order to have sufficient manpower to do this work well. This mobilization must be from the federation of industry and commerce to the various trade associations, from the various trade associations to each enterprise, and from each enterprise to all shareholders and employees, so that there can be no omissions in clearing inventory, meticulously investigating market prices, correctly deliberating prices, and reasonably revaluing property and adjusting capital. In particular, large industrial and commercial enterprises with the ability should help small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, otherwise it will be impossible to complete this work solely by relying on the manpower of the government.
    Furthermore, in carrying out this work, efforts should be made to do the following:
    (1) The price standard on December 31 must be correctly evaluated.
    (2) Every household must not have property that is underreported or underestimated.
    (3) The government will never attempt to increase the burden on industry and commerce from the revaluation of property, and industrialists and businessmen should not attempt to use the opportunity of revaluation of property to evade the burden, so that the revaluation of property work loses its correctness.
    (4) Investors should recognize that the purpose of adjusting capital is to help the development of the business, and must not demand to divide the increase in value in the revalued property because of the adjustment of capital, or even demand to withdraw shares, so that the enterprise falls into difficulties as a result.
    Since the great movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and protecting the country has been launched across the country, the unprecedented enthusiasm shown by industrialists and businessmen across the country is commendable. The movement of signing patriotic covenants by the federations of industry and commerce in various places following the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the holding of demonstrations and parades following the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, fully demonstrates that the Chinese people who have stood up, regardless of any class, have an unprecedented unity in organization, and have a clear understanding and a clear position in politics. Therefore, we also firmly believe that the national industrial and commercial circles will be able to do a good job in revaluing property and adjusting capital. It is precisely because of this confidence that the government has resolutely announced this measure, regardless of the current tense situation. If the national industrial and commercial circles can do a good job in this work, not only can it provide the necessary conditions for the restoration and development of industry and commerce, but it can also enable the government to better understand the production capacity and material stock of private enterprises, which is of great help to adjusting production and sales relations, formulating production plans, and carrying out the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and protecting the country. The national industrial and commercial circles mobilize and strive to complete the work of revaluing property and adjusting capital!

    全国工商界动员起来，为完成重估财产调整资本的工作而努力！
    吴羡梅
    私营企业重估财产调整资本办法已经政务院财政经济委员会公布施行，这是全国工商界盼望已久的一件大事，私营企业能做好重估财产调整资本的工作，对于本身业务的改进与发展固然能有极大的帮助，对于调整公私关系、劳资关系、特别是在奖励投资上，亦必然会有很好的贡献。
    （一）为什么要重估财产调整资本呢？这是因为国民党反动政府多年以来造成的通货恶性膨胀，使私营企业的帐面金额和实际价值相差甚巨，帐表数字，全不可靠，于是就发生了下列三种影响：（１）私营企业由于历年币制的变动，多次折算后帐面的资本额与实值脱节，原来一百万银元的资本，现在在帐面上的记载可能还不到一分钱，这是一桩很普遍而极不合理的事。投资人对于企业中自己的投资究竟值多少钱既不知道，股份就不能自由转让，企业本身亦无法吸收新的投资。企业负责人根据不正确的财产价值亦无从结出合理的盈余，即真有盈余，亦因为通货在继续贬值以及没有确实的资本额，亦很难合理分配。以上情况，都足以影响投资人对于企业的兴趣，甚至发生投资人与企业间的纠纷。还有因为固定资产不能摊提足额的折旧，就会减少了企业本身重置固定资产的力量。所以不重估财产调整资本，便使大家不愿意向企业投资，使企业的存在和发展受到严重的影响。（２）通货恶性膨胀的结果，必然使企业在结帐时发生巨额的虚盈，一元钱的货物到年底涨到十元钱，帐面上的毛利便是九元钱，假使按照这种虚盈去课税，便成为移本作利虚盈实税，削弱了私营企业的基础，违背了合理负担的原则。解放后很多地区虽允许按物价变化计算盈余，但因财产未经确实估价，各地办法又不一致，盈余计算仍难做到确实。相反的方面，过去在反动政府统治下，为了避免虚盈实税，做假帐相当普遍。我们现在既不能继续容许做假帐，违法逃税，那就必须用重估财产调整资本这一办法来扫除这一种积习。还有在公私双方发生交易行为时，私营企业因为资本额不正确不能计算合法利润，固定资产价值不正确不能摊提合理折旧，成本便极难正确计算。所以不能重估财产调整资本，会使公私关系受到影响。（３）私营企业结帐发生虚盈，很容易因虚盈而在职工分红或发奖金时发生纠纷。所以不能重估财产调整资本，也可能使劳资关系受到影响。总之，私营企业不能有正确真实的帐目，便很难改善经营，实行经济核算，原投资人利益既乏保障，新投资人参加亦有困难。私营企业的恢复和发展因此将受极大的阻碍，这就是必须重估财产调整资本的原因。
    （二）为什么现在可以办理重估财产调整资本这一工作呢？调整资本这一件事，在反动政府统治时期，虽经工商界在抗日战争中多次要求，始终不曾答应。在抗战胜利后虽然定了一套工矿运输事业重估固定资产价值调整资本办法，可是仅限于固定资产，用全国平均物价指数做标准，还要减半计算，完全是自欺欺人，脱离实际。并且在通货继续恶性膨胀下，即使重估当时有一部分正确性，亦会立即失去。所以物价不稳定，这件事是无法做的。自从今年三月统一财经工作后，财政收支趋于平衡，结束了十余年来的通货恶性膨胀，币值及物价，基本上已经达到稳定，这便提供了重估财产调整资本的先决条件。因此在五月工商局长会议以及六月税务局长会议中都曾讨论此事，认为有及早办理的必要。并决定于今年年底办理，这样就可以与通常年度的结帐结合起来，省去一次盘点财产的麻烦手续。同时政府又鉴于各大城市自去年以来，事实上已陆续在不同的时期用各种不同的计算单位（如人民币、折实单位、各种粮食、纱布、银元等）在重估财产，所以应当早些制订统一的办法，使重估财产的结果，可以作为调整资本，以及分红课税等的确实基础。
    （三）重估财产调整资本办法的特点是些什么？这个办法是今年十一月间由中央私营企业局会同税务总局，并邀集京沪津各地工商局、税务局、工商联的代表，及会计专家等在详细研讨后起草，又经政务院财政经济委员会委务会议通过的，办法中有几个特点可以指出。
    第一、这个办法是有原则，同时又有弹性的，如：
    （１）办法中规定全国各地区的私营企业都应于一九五○年十二月三十一日办理本年度通常决算以后，将全部财产重估价值并调整其资本额，可是为了照顾到某些城市有特殊困难不能举办时，亦得经大行政区财政经济委员会核准暂缓举办。
    （２）重估财产虽规定一律以一九五○年十二月三十一日之当地当时价格为估价标准，可是在遇到某种物价有不正常的波动，不能以十二月三十一日为标准的时候，亦可由各地评审委员会公议合理价格为估价标准。
    （３）办完重估财产调整资本的期限，规定一般以一九五一年六月三十日为限，可是对于重估财产及调整资本这两件工作，在六个月中如何规定每件工作的期限，以及有特殊困难必须适当延长办理期限的时候，都可由当地工商行政机关斟酌决定。
    （４）办法中规定私营企业都应当重估财产调整资本，可是对于小城市及小乡镇的店铺和大市县营业范围极小又无记帐能力的私营企业，亦得由当地评审委员会酌准免办财产重估。
    以上这些规定，都是鉴于我国地域辽阔，大小城市中工商业户多寡不同，私营企业的种类繁多，规模大小悬殊，美帝又正在对我们进行军事侵略及经济封锁，有些地区解放较晚，或有其他特殊任务，当地的政府机关及工商团体在人力上组织上感到不够充实，或有特殊严重情况无暇负担起这一任务时，不能不实事求是，作一些机动的规定。如东北地区由于抗美援朝工作特别紧张，中央已经允许暂不普遍进行。
    第二、这个办法是坚持公私兼顾的政策，充分照顾工商业家的实际困难的，如：
    （１）因为过去反动政府的通货恶性膨胀，使许多私营企业不得不做假帐，帐面上的财产并不真实。我们承认这一历史上的事实，可是现在币值物价都已稳定，做假帐这件事再延续下去，非但政府不能容许，工商界本身亦都以此为苦，急求解决。所以办法中规定重估的财产必须为一九五○年十二月三十一日实有的财产，凡确为企业所有而并未入帐的财产，应一并盘点估价整理入帐。
    （２）对于存货的估价，是规定依照同业公议价格单为标准。这价格单不能不由各地评审委员会作统一的评定，以表示当时当地的正确价格。可是私营企业在习惯上结帐时的存货价格，一般都定的比时价为低，这种稳健的习惯，应当适当地加以照顾。所以容许私营企业在自行估价时较同业公议价格单的标准酌量低估，再交由评审委员会审定。不过如超过标准高估，会影响到企业本身的安全，那是不容许的。
    （３）对于重估财产后的增值，我们认为这是通货恶性膨胀所造成的帐面的增值，不能当做盈余看待；因此特别加以照顾，规定不征收工商业所得税。同时亦规定除抵销亏损外，不得视为盈余分配，以免削弱企业的基础。至于一九五○年的所得税仍照工商业税暂行条例及其有关规定征税；因为一九五○年的所得税，与这次的重估财产调整资本完全是两件事情，不能混为一谈时。
    第三、这个办法是把重估财产调整资本当作工商业家自己的事情，主要通过同业公会用民主协商的办法来进行，如：
    （１）存货估价标准先由同业自己公议价格，我们深信通过民主协商的同业公议，一定会产生合理的价格，而不必由政府来硬性规定。
    （２）关于重估财产及调整资本，曾有先办重估财产的意见，认为调整资本困难很多，容易引起各种纠纷。可是我们知道工商界一致认为重估财产调整资本，这两件事必须同时举办。如果资本不确定，则分派股息、红利便无标准，更难进行增资，至于调整资本的办法，在政府规定的统一的原则下，可以让投资人与企业负责人自己去商量解决。
    （３）重估财产增值应转作资本及公积，对于这两者的比例，未作硬性规定。因为企业的创办有先后，公积的有无多少情况不同，由于币制的变动，资本与公积变动的比例亦不同，所以只能规定由企业负责人依据有关法令，参照过去的实收资本数额和现在的业务及财务情况自行拟定。某些企业的投资人为希望多得些股金与股息，也许主张多提资本，少提公积；可是在企业的负责人方面为了企业的稳健与发展，一定想提出适当的公积。投资人与企业负责人两者之间的矛盾，一定会经过民主协商获得统一，定出资本与公积的比例。这个比例，必须是足以鼓励私人投资，同时顾及企业基础的巩固。
    此外关于各种财产如存货、固定资产、债权、资产、金银外汇及国外资产、证券及投资、无形资产、递延资产、负债等估价标准，都经过详细研讨，有合理的详细规定，必为工商界所乐于接受的。
    （四）全国工商界如何来做好重估财产调整资本的工作？今年十月上海市第二届第一次各界人民代表大会，曾通过了工商界代表徐永祚、胡厥文等三十二人的提案建议中央从速公布营利事业重估财产价值调整资本办法，此项办法既经政府全部采纳，全国工商界就应当协助当地工商行政机关，做好重估财产调整资本这一工作。要做好这一工作，首先工商界必须对这一工作的意义有明确的认识。各地的工商联及同业公会，一定要以完成这一工作为明年度的中心任务之一，做好广泛与深入的宣传，使每一工商业者，都要了解这是与本身的利益有关的事，每一个人都能主动积极地毫无顾虑地来完成这一工作。
    其次，工商界必须全体动员起来，才能有足够的人力做好这一工作。这一动员，必须是由工商联动员到各同业公会，由各同业公会动员到每一企业，由每一企业动员到全体股东和职工，才能够毫无遗漏地盘清存货，缜密地调查市价，正确地公议价格，合理地重估财产调整资本。尤其是有能力的大工商业应当帮助中小工商业，否则单靠政府的人力，是无法完成这一工作的。
    更次，在进行这一工作中要努力做到下列几件事：
    （１）要正确评定十二月三十一日的价格标准。
    （２）要使每家每户没有短报或漏估的财产。
    （３）政府决不企图从重估财产中增加工商业的负担，工商业家亦不应当企图利用重估财产的机会来逃避负担，使这重估财产工作丧失其正确性。
    （４）投资人应认清调整资本的目的在帮助事业发展，决不可因调整资本而要求瓜分重估财产中的增值，或甚至要求撤股，使企业反因此而陷入困境。
    在全国掀起抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动以来，全国工商业者所表现的空前的热情，是值得称许的。各地工商联继北京工商联之后签订爱国公约运动，继天津工商联之后举行示威大游行，充分表示了已经站起来的中国人民，不论任何阶层，在组织上都有了空前的团结，在政治上都已有了清楚的认识和明确的立场。因此我们亦深信全国工商界一定能做好重估财产调整资本这一工作。正因为有这样的信心，政府才不顾目前时局的紧张，而毅然公布了这一个办法。全国工商界能做好这一工作，非但可以提供了工商业恢复和发展的必要条件，同时亦可以使政府对私营企业的生产能力及物资存量更增加些了解，这对于调整产销关系，制订生产计划，以及进行抗美援朝保家卫国的工作是有很大的帮助的。全国工商界动员起来，为完成重估财产调整资本的工作而努力！
