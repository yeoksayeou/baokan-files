Xinhua News Agency, 15th: With revolutionary anti-imperialist traditions, Chinese railway workers have contributed new achievements in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country. Following the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau's completion of its annual transportation task 22 days ahead of schedule, at 6:00 PM on the 15th, the Tianjin Railway Bureau announced the completion of its 1950 annual transportation task half a month ahead of schedule. The railway freight loading task completed over 100% of the annual plan, the tonnage sent completed 103.2%, and the vehicle turnover rate was shortened by 0.18 days compared to the Ministry's set standard. Passenger transport tasks were also overfulfilled.

The combination of railway workers' patriotic enthusiasm and the wisdom of the working class has improved work methods. For example, during the slack season for transportation, each station in the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau generally established solicitation teams, the Tianjin Sub-bureau used off-duty time to pick up and deliver goods for cargo owners, and the Beijing Sub-bureau used propaganda teams to go deep into the field to solicit customers. Various localities adopted different methods according to their specific circumstances to solve the difficulty of cargo sources, thus completing the loading tasks during the off-season.

Tianjin, Guye and other stations implemented new operating methods, thus shortening turnaround and dwell times, and saving shunting locomotives. After the Beijing Xizhimen Station implemented a new shunting method, operating efficiency increased by nearly 100%. Model shunting groups with ten thousand accident-free couplings (10,000 shunting operations) continuously emerged throughout the railway. After the Tianjin Station's Mei Zhongsan shunting group learned Ma Wan Hook's operating methods, they even completed a new record of nearly 50,000 accident-free couplings. In this way, they ensured the speed and safety of decoupling (separating vehicles) and marshalling, shortening the vehicle turnover rate.

Various stations have improved ticket sales methods and work systems, eliminating the feudal forces of black market tickets and luggage bundling that have existed for years. Major stations also provide free stoves, solving the difficulties of drinking water and winter cold for passengers.

Over the past year, the Tianjin Railway Administration has seen the emergence of eight model chartered car groups, two women's chartered car groups, and eight high-achieving passenger ticket offices. The Tianjin Railway Bureau's over-fulfillment of its annual transportation task half a month ahead of schedule is a comprehensive demonstration of the efforts of the staff of various levels and departments of the railway bureau. Currently, all employees of the bureau are putting forward the new slogan of "launching the patriotic production competition movement more deeply and widely, and striving to overfulfill tasks even more."

    天津铁路局  
    提前半月完成全年运输任务
    【新华社十五日讯】具有反帝革命传统的中国铁路工人在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中又贡献了新的工作成绩，继北京铁路分局提前二十二天完成全年运输任务后，十五日十八点钟，天津铁路局一九五○年全年运输任务宣告提前半个月完成。铁路货运装车任务完成了全年计划百分之百强，发送吨数完成了百分之一零三点二，车辆周转率较部定标准缩短了零点一八天。客运任务亦超额完成。
    铁路工人的爱国热情与工人阶级的智慧相结合，改进了作业方法。比如，张家口分局在运输清闲的季度里，各站普遍成立了招揽小组，天津分局利用休班时间替货主起送货物，北京分局采用宣传队深入现场招揽顾客。各地根据不同的具体情形采用不同方式解决货源困难，因而完成了淡季的装车任务。
    天津、古冶等站实行了新的作业方法，因此缩短了周转和停留时间，节省了调车机车。北京西直门站实行新调车法后，作业效能提高了将近一倍。全路不断地涌现万钩（钩车一万次）无事故的模范调车组，天津站梅仲三调车组学习了马万钩的作业方法后，更完成了将近五万钩无事故的新纪录。他们就是这样保证了解体（把车辆解开）、编组的迅速和安全，使车辆周转率缩短。
    各车站则改善了售票办法和工作制度，根绝了历年存在的黑票和搂包的封建势力。各主要车站更免费供应火炉，解决了旅客饮水和冬季寒冷的困难。
    一年来，天津铁路管理局出现了八个模范包车组，两个妇女包乘组和八个成绩优良的客票房。天津铁路局全路运输任务超额提前半个月完成，是该铁路局各级机构各部门职工努力的综合表现。现该局全体员工正在提出“把爱国主义生产竞赛运动更深入、广泛展开，争取更多超额完成任务”的新的口号。
