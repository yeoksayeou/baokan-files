    Avoid Unnecessary Circulation of Salt
    To the Editor:
    Our county's cooperative needs to supply salt to its members and the masses. It cannot buy it in Tianjin, so it has to buy it from the Baoding Salt Company and transport it back to Rongcheng (this is a reverse flow of materials). Using large carts, including labor costs, the cost per catty is 1.124 yuan. If we buy salt from the Dingxing Salt Company, although it is not a reverse flow of materials, the cost cannot be reduced because the labor costs cannot be lowered. In early November, the Tianjin Salt Company's salt price was 0.930 yuan. If we buy from them and use water transport from the Daqing River, it would be convenient, and the cost per catty would only be about 0.980 yuan (because the shipping cost is lower than the train fare). This way, the masses can eat cheaper salt. However, we have contacted the Tianjin Salt Company several times, but they will not sell to us. Comrades from the Salt Company said, "You belong to the Baoding Special District, and for unified control, you should get approval in Baoding." However, some small merchants in our county can transport some salt from Tianjin (in small quantities), but the price is cheaper than the supply and marketing cooperative. Thus, the masses and members are reflecting: Why is your salt more expensive than private merchants? We believe that state-owned companies should consider the law of material circulation in their business operations and provide convenience for cooperative operations. It should not be rigidly managed according to administrative divisions. We don't know if our opinion is appropriate. Please reply.
    Rongcheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative

    Rongcheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative:
    Your suggestion that state-owned companies should avoid the reverse flow of materials in their business operations is correct in our opinion. However, according to the agreement between the China Salt Industry Company and the North China Cooperative Federation in September—supply and marketing cooperatives in North China provinces and cities can submit a plan for the required amount of salt based on the actual number of members, and send it to the China Salt Company for approval to transport from the beaches themselves, in order to supply members with cheap salt—your county's members' salt should be uniformly allocated by the Hebei Provincial Federation. According to your letter, the cost of transporting salt back from Baoding is more expensive than private merchants transporting it directly from Tianjin to Rongcheng, precisely because the reverse flow of materials increases the cost. This is an unreasonable phenomenon. To avoid this situation, we believe that the provincial and municipal supply and marketing federations should not rigidly transport the large quantities of salt they have ordered to the general federation before uniformly allocating them to each county. Instead, they should allocate and transfer them at the point of departure according to the distance between the production area and each county to reduce unnecessary transportation costs.
    The Tianjin Salt Company did not sell you salt because it was the peak season for salt sales at that time, and there was a rush to purchase in the market. Therefore, it was necessary to take care of the local market supply first and stop selling to other places.

    避免食盐不必要的流转
    编辑同志：
    我县合作社，要供给社员群众食盐，在天津买不到，要从保定盐业公司去买了运回容城（这是物资倒流），用大车运加脚费在内，每斤成本需一、一二四元。如果从定兴盐业公司买盐，虽然不是物资倒流，但因为脚费不能减少，所以成本也不能降低。十一月上旬天津盐业公司食盐牌价是九三○元，如果我们买了从大清河利用水运既方便，每斤成本也不过九八○元（因船费比火车费轻），这样群众可以吃上便宜盐。但我们和天津盐业公司几次接洽，都不卖给。盐业公司同志说：“你们属保定专区，为了统一掌握，应该在保定去批。”但是我县有的小商贩，都能从天津运来一部分食盐（数量不大），但价格则较供销社便宜，这样群众和社员反映说：你们的食盐为什么比私商的还贵？我们认为：国营公司经营业务，应该照顾到物资流转规律，给合作社经营以方便，似不应该死板地按行政区划来经营业务。我们的意见不知道是否妥当？请答复。
    容城县供销合作社
    容城县供销合作社：
    你们所提出的国营公司在经营业务时，应该避免物资的倒流现象，我们认为是正确的。不过根据中国盐业公司九月份与华北合作总社的协议——华北各省市供销社可按其实有社员人数，计划食盐的需用量，送请中盐公司批准，自行向海滩报运，俾能廉价供应社员食盐——你县社员食盐应由河北省总社统一调配。据你们来信所谈，供销社从保定运回食盐比私商从天津直接运达容城还要贵，就正因为是物资倒流而增加了成本的缘故。这是不合理的现象。为了避免这种情况，我们认为各地省市供销总社不应该硬性地将自己所定购的大批食盐运达总社后，才行统一调配各县，而应该根据产区距各县的远近，在起运点分配调拨，以减少不必要的运费。
    天津盐业公司不卖给你们食盐，是因为当时正值食盐的旺销季节，市场曾发生争购的现象，故首先需要照顾当地市场的供应而停止售给外地。
