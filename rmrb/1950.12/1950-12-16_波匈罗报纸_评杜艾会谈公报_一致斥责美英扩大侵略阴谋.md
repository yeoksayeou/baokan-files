Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian newspapers, in commenting on the communiqué issued after the Truman-Attlee talks in Washington, unanimously condemned the U.S.-British imperialist bloc’s attempt to continue expanding its aggression.

    Poland's *Życie Warszawy* stated: The U.S. and British imperialists, having suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, have no intention of peacefully resolving the Far East issue. Instead, they are attempting to expand their military adventures to Europe. However, the schemes of the Washington aggressors have already been met with strong protests from the world's peace defenders. Truman and Attlee’s conspiracy is doomed to failure.

    Hungary's Budapest *Szabad Nép* stated: The result of the Washington talks proves that Truman and Attlee completely disregarded the widespread demand of the people to stop interfering in Korea and decided to adopt a policy of continuing aggression in Korea and preparing to expand the war of aggression. This makes it clear to the whole world who are the aggressors and who are the mortal enemies of the independence and freedom of all nations. The commentary pointed out: The imperialist offensive against the people of all countries will inevitably arouse greater resistance from the people of all countries.

    Romania's *Scînteia* commented that although the communiqué of the Truman-Attlee talks tried hard to restore the already disgraced prestige of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it failed to conceal the deep contradictions existing between the U.S. and Britain. Therefore, the U.S. and Western Europe were uniformly disappointed with Washington. *Scînteia* concluded by saying: Romania’s peace defenders condemn the new and ugly actions of the warmongers, and stand together with peace defenders all over the world, determined to fight more resolutely to defeat the Wall Street conspiracy and strive for the implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress.

    波匈罗报纸            
    评杜艾会谈公报            
    一致斥责美英扩大侵略阴谋
    【新华社十五日讯】波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚的报纸在评论杜鲁门艾德礼华盛顿会谈后发表的公报时，一致斥责美英帝国主义集团妄图继续扩大侵略的阴谋。
    波兰《华沙生活报》称：在朝鲜遭受惨败的美英帝国主义者，丝毫也不想和平解决远东问题，反而企图把军事冒险扩大到欧洲。但是，华盛顿侵略者的阴谋业已遭受世界和平保卫者强有力的抗议。杜鲁门艾德礼的阴谋注定要遭到失败的。
    匈牙利布达佩斯《自由人民报》称：华盛顿会谈的结果证明杜鲁门艾德礼完全不顾广大人民关于停止干涉朝鲜的要求，而决定采取继续侵略朝鲜和准备扩大侵略战争的政策。这就使全世界看清楚：谁是侵略者，谁是各国人民独立与自由的死敌。评论指出：帝国主义对各国人民的进攻，必然会引起各国人民更大的反抗。
    罗马尼亚《火花报》评论称：杜艾会谈的公报虽然力图恢复北大西洋公约业已扫地的威信，但是却未能掩饰美英间存在着的深刻矛盾。因此，美国和西欧对于华盛顿一致感到失望。火花报在结语中说：罗马尼亚的和平保卫者斥责战争贩子们新的丑恶行动，并和全世界和平保卫者站在一起，决心更坚毅地为击败华尔街阴谋、争取实现二届和大决议而斗争。
