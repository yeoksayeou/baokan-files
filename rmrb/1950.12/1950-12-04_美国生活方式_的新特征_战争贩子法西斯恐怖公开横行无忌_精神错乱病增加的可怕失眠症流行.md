Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st dispatch: The Labor Daily published on November 28th a New York dispatch by Ostapov and Leonidov, titled "New Features of the 'American Way of Life.'" This dispatch describes the changes that have taken place in New York life over the past year. Attentive observers can notice these changes after only a few hours in the city. The reporters write: It is easy to see that people are in a country that has moved from "cold war" to direct aggression and is seeking all possible ways to expand and incite direct aggression.

In the center of Broadway, in Times Square, are agencies recruiting new soldiers. An exhibition praising the "merits" of the American invading army in Korea is nearby. But from all appearances, these "merits" do not move the audience at all: the number of volunteers is negligible. To find cannon fodder at home, the warmongers are intensifying their use of propaganda posters.

Until recently, the authors of cheap horror novels almost completely monopolized the market for inciting war hysteria by writing adventure novels depicting all kinds of murders, madness, and rapes. Now they are being helped by newsreels, which shamelessly screen the atrocities of the American invading army in Korea with unprecedented audacity. The newsreels show naked Koreans, including women, being beaten and sent to "death camps." The reporter shamelessly explains that they were stripped naked because they were suspected of hiding weapons.

The propagandists of the "American way of life" are trying to force ordinary people to accept the idea that American world hegemony is indispensable and that another world war is inevitable. The average American is troubled and poisoned by the idea of hatred of humanity, and therefore uneasy. His mind is feverish, his life is now difficult, and he worries about tomorrow. He has long been unable to make ends meet, although the profits of the monopoly enterprises are increasing incredibly. The average American is repeatedly told that they must save as much as possible. Ordinary Americans do not want war; they know that war can only bring them endless suffering. However, many people still dare not sign the Stockholm Appeal because the open fascist terror of the warmongers and their accomplices is so rampant and unscrupulous. The reporter concludes: Therefore, no wonder that the incidence of mental illness is increasing terribly in this overseas "paradise." America has become a country with an epidemic of insomnia. This is the result of the infamous "American way of life."

    “美国生活方式”的新特征
    战争贩子法西斯恐怖公开横行无忌
    精神错乱病增加的可怕失眠症流行
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于十一月二十八日刊出奥斯塔坡夫和里昂尼多夫的纽约通讯，题为《“美国生活方式”的新特征》，这个通讯写出了过去一年纽约生活中所发生的变化。留心的观察者只要在这个城里停留几个钟头，就可以注意到这种变化。记者写道：很容易看出人们是在这样的一个国家里，这个国家已从“冷战”进入直接侵略，并且正在寻求一切可能的办法来扩大和煽动直接侵略。
    在百老汇中心，在时报广场上，有着征募新兵的机关。颂扬美国侵朝军“功绩”的展览会就在附近。但是从各种情形看来，这些“功绩”都一点也不能使观众感动：志愿参加的人数是微不足道的。战争贩子们为了在国内找寻炮灰，正在加紧利用宣传画。
    直到最近，廉价的恐怖小说的作者用描写各种各样的谋杀、颠狂和强奸的冒险小说，几乎完全垄断了煽动战争歇斯底里的市场。现在它们又得到了新闻电影片的帮助，这些新闻电影以闻所未闻的厚颜无耻公开放映美国侵朝军的暴行。新闻电影片映出了遭到痛打的赤身裸体的朝鲜人，包括妇女们在内，被送往“死亡营”途中的情形。报告员无耻地解释道，他们所以被剥去衣服，是因为恐怕他们藏有武器。
    “美国生活方式”的宣传者试图强使普通人接受这样一种思想，即美国的世界霸权是不可或缺的，另一次世界大战是不可避免的。美国的一般人为仇恨人类的思想所困恼和毒害，因而忐忑不安。他头脑发烧，他的生活现在是艰难的，他担心明天。他长久以来不能收支相抵，虽然垄断企业的利润增加得令人难以相信。美国的一般人却一再听到说，他们必须尽量节约。美国的普通人并不希望战争，他们知道战争能够给他们带来的只是无限的痛苦。然而有许多人还不敢在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，因为战争贩子们及其同谋犯的公开法西斯恐怖是如此的横行无忌。记者结语说：因此，怪不得在这海外“天堂”里精神错乱的病症增加得令人可怕。美国已成为失眠症流行的国家了。这便是臭名远扬的“美国生活方式”的结果。
