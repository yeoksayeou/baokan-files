    Resist America, Aid Korea—Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Nation
    Wang Zizhong, Director-General of the North China Christian Joint Association
    Christian believers are second to none in patriotism, whether during the Anti-Japanese War or now. Since the United States is aggressing against China, we must support Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Nation, and support it with actions.

    I. Strive for self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, expand the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and realize a self-reliant and indigenous church.
    II. Prevent traitors and spies, so that the church will not be exploited by anyone.
    III. Educate believers on the understanding of national policies, strive to build a new China, and organize and train relief work, to realize the spirit of Jesus' love for humanity.

    抗美援朝——保家卫国
    华北基督教联合会总干事  王梓仲
    基督教徒爱国是不落人后的，无论是在抗日时期，或是现在。美国侵略中国，我们一定是拥护抗美援朝保家卫国，并且是用行动来拥护的。
    一、努力自治、自养、自传，扩大三自运动，实现自立本色的教会。
    二、防奸防谍，使教会不受任何人所利用。
    三、教育信徒对国家大计之认识，努力建设新中国，并组织与训练救护工作，以实现耶稣爱人之精神。
