(Reported by this newspaper) The heroic actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting Korea, and the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, have fundamentally changed the situation on the Korean battlefield. The Korean people have expressed their boundless gratitude for this brotherly support from the Chinese people. Mass rallies responding to the call of the Korean Fatherland Front are being widely held throughout Korea. Many places, amidst the enthusiastic cheers of all participants, passed letters to Chairman Mao of China and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, expressing their gratitude to the Chinese people. Every letter is filled with the belief in the close unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and the determination to carry the anti-aggression liberation war to the end and drive out the American aggressors. Below are four letters to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers passed by the mass rallies of people from all walks of life in Gaogai Village, Manpo County, and Sinuiju on November 26th and 28th respectively.

    Letter from the People of All Circles in Sinuiju City to Chairman Mao
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Thanks to the heroic struggle of our brave Korean People's Army and the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army, our liberation war has begun a turn for the better with great historical significance. All the people of our Sinuiju City express our heartfelt gratitude to you for the active support given to us by our Chinese brothers.
    Great Chairman Mao! The American imperialist bandits are attempting to dominate the world and are frantically invading our country's northern border. They have carried out beastly atrocities, slaughtering our beloved parents and siblings, and destroying and burning the people's property.
    Now that we have lost our families and homes, we are burning with a determination for revenge against the American bandits. We have a firm fighting spirit to overcome any difficulty and to strike and sweep away the last enemy.
    Respected Chairman Mao!
    We believe that no matter how the American imperialists struggle, they will inevitably fail in Korea, just as they failed in China.
    We will never forget the assistance of the great Chinese people, and we will be even more courageous in the struggle to defend our country and sweep away the enemy. With the powerful Chinese people fighting alongside us and advancing bravely, final victory will surely be ours.
    The great friendship of the great Soviet Union, which stands at the forefront of the world's peace and democracy camp, further confirms our confidence in victory.
    In order to consolidate the victories already won and strive for new victories, we will unfold our struggle more resolutely. At the same time, we must further consolidate the friendship between us and the people of all democratic countries, led by the great Soviet people and the Chinese people. We are firmly determined to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as much as we support our People's Army. Finally, we express our sincere gratitude to our comrades, the Chinese people, and to you. We celebrate the glorious victory of the Chinese people and you.

                                    November 28, 1950
    Letter from the People of Gaogai Village, Manpo County to Chairman Mao
    Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people and dear friend of the Korean people:
    We absolutely welcome and cheer the declaration issued on November 4th by the Chinese democratic parties, led by the Chinese Communist Party. All the people of Gaogai Village, Manpo District, Manpo County, extend our brotherly respect and gratitude to you and all the Chinese people.
    Respected Chairman Mao!
    The American imperialists, dreaming of dominating the world, are continuing their barbaric armed aggression in order to achieve their sinister goal of turning our Korea into their permanent colony and a military strategic base in Asia against the Soviet Union and China.
    The most barbaric American imperialists of the twentieth century are staining our beautiful rivers and mountains with blood, turning all noble cultural heritage and property into ashes. The American aggressors are mistreating our parents, brothers, and sisters. However, all the Korean people have stood up like one in the struggle for the freedom and independence of our country. We have not been conquered by their barbaric military force and atrocities, and we can never be conquered by them.
    Respected Chairman Mao!
    Today, the unity of the Korean and Chinese people, who have risen up for the independence, freedom, peace, and security of their countries, in a victorious struggle like brothers, is not only an unprecedented achievement in the history of the national liberation struggles of the Korean and Chinese peoples, but also sets an example of international connection and combatant unity for the people who are fighting for freedom and national independence.
    Therefore, this is an iron hammer striking down the American imperialist aggressors.
    The people of Korea and China are united like steel for the independence and freedom of their countries, for the freedom and happiness of all the people of Asia, and further for the peace and security of the whole world. In the face of the power of this unity, any mad offensive of the imperialist aggressors will be stopped and will be defeated.
    Today, our Chinese brothers are shedding righteous blood on our land. This will become a symbol of the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, which will further tighten and consolidate the unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and further encourage and strengthen the victorious spirit and belief that beats in the hearts of the Korean people.
    The Korean people will pass on the deeds of the Chinese brothers to future generations for eternity.
    We, all the people of Gaogai Village, at the mass rally determined to dedicate all our strength to the struggle for the independence and freedom of our country, wish Chairman Mao a long life for the freedom and happiness of all the people of Asia, and for the peace and security of the whole world!
                    Mass Rally of Villagers of Gaogai Village, Manpo District, Manpo County, Ciangdao Province, Korea
                                      November 26, 1950
    Letter from the People of Sinuiju City to Our Chinese People's Volunteers
    Dear soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Today, we are responding to the call of the Fatherland Front by holding a significant rally and extending our heartfelt respect and glory to you heroic comrades.
    Dear Comrades!
    The people of Korea and China have had close ties throughout a long history. At any time in the common struggle against foreign aggressors, we have always carried out the heroic struggle side by side.
    We were together in the past struggle against Japanese imperialism, and we are together today in the struggle against American imperialism.
    When the American bandits, dreaming of conquering the world by force, began a beastly armed invasion of our country and people, the great Chinese people severely condemned the atrocities of American imperialism and raised the torch of support for our Korean people.
    You joined the Korean War to help the Korean people and defend your country, fighting alongside our brave People's Army and inflicting significant losses on the enemy. Today's situation has turned in our favor.
    Dear Comrades!
    Our Korean and Chinese peoples are tightly hand in hand, fighting bravely under the banner of the worldwide democratic camp led by the great Soviet Union, and the light of victory will surely belong to us.
    We can never forget that you shed your noble blood to participate in the just war.
    Your struggle to overthrow the American imperialist aggressors and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, unifying the vast China of 475 million people, is a great example for our Korean people.
    Respected soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Our struggle is for final victory, let us hold hands more tightly and fight bravely!
    The future of you who are fighting for justice is full of victory and glory.
    Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the consolidated friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples!
                      Sinuiju City Supporting the Fatherland Front's Call to Action Rally
                                    November 28, 1950
    Letter from the People of Gaogai Village, Manpo County to Our Chinese People's Volunteers
    Brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    At a time when our Fatherland Liberation War for the independence and freedom of our country is fiercely underway, all of us Korean people extend our national gratitude to you for your actions of voluntarily rising up to participate in the Korean War to oppose American imperialism and assist Korea, and we extend our brotherly welcome and greatest honor to you.
    The American bandits are plotting to turn our country into their permanent colony and a military base for their aggression against the Soviet Union and China in order to dominate the whole world. They provoked a war on the territory of our country, staining our beautiful territory with blood, turning noble cultural treasures and valuable property into ashes, and slaughtering our parents, our brothers, and our sisters.
    But the brave Korean People's Army and the patriotic Korean people have not been conquered by them, and the American bandits can never conquer the Korean people.
    Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have fraternal friendship with the Korean people!
    The interests of the Korean and Chinese nations, whose borders are adjacent, are consistent. In the war of national liberation for independence and freedom against the imperialist aggressors, the peoples of Korea and China have often been in the same fate throughout history.
    Thus, it is natural and just that the Korean and Chinese peoples are fighting together today against the common enemy who wants to invade Korea and China - American imperialism.
    This is not only a huge event of epoch-making significance in the history of the national liberation struggles of the Korean and Chinese peoples, but also an example of international solidarity and combatant friendship of the people who are fighting for national freedom and national independence.
    Outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, soldiers of the incomparably brave Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Today, you are shedding noble righteous blood on the territory of our country. This righteous action further consolidates the eternal friendship and unity of our Korean and Chinese peoples, and further inspires the anti-enemy spirit and belief in victory that animates the hearts of the Korean people.
    We received your support at a critical time in determining the fate of our country. Under the close joint operations of our People's Army and you, we have already repelled and annihilated most of the vicious American aggressor army.
    The fruits of the friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples formed by justice and blood, and your glorious achievements, will shine forever like the waters of the Yalu River, which have been rolling green for thousands of years.
    We are determined to fight alongside you to the end, we express our infinite gratitude to you here, and we have actively launched the work of supporting you.
    May the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting for the independence, freedom, peace, and security of the country, be forever glorious!
                    Mass Rally of Villagers of Gaogai Village, Manpo District, Manpo County, Ciangdao Province, Korea
                                      November 26, 1950

    感谢我国人民的友谊援助
    朝鲜人民写信给毛主席   
    并写信向我人民志愿军致敬
    【本报讯】我国人民志愿援朝的英雄行为，以及我国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军比肩作战所取得的辉煌胜利，已根本上改变了朝鲜战场的形势。朝鲜人民对于我国人民这一兄弟般的支援表示了无限的感谢。朝鲜各地正广泛地召开响应朝鲜祖国战线号召的群众奋起大会，许多地方在全体与会群众的热烈欢呼声中通过给我国毛泽东主席及我国人民志愿部队的信，表示对我国人民的谢意。每封信都充满了中朝人民紧密团结的信念，及将反侵略的解放战争进行到底，驱逐美国侵略者的决心。下面是满浦县高盖里和新义州的各界人民奋起大会分别于十一月二十六日及二十八日所通过的给毛主席和中国人民志愿军的四封信。
    新义州市各界人民给毛主席的信尊敬的毛泽东主席：
    由于我们英勇的朝鲜人民军和伟大的中国人民志愿部队英雄的斗争，我们的解放战争已开始了具有伟大历史意义的好转。我们新义州市全体人民，为了中国兄弟给我们积极支援，向您致衷心的感谢。
    伟大的毛泽东主席！美帝国主义强盗企图霸占全世界，疯狂地侵犯至我们祖国北部国境。它们进行了野兽般的暴行，屠杀了我们可爱的父母兄弟，破坏和烧毁了人民的财产。
    现在我们失掉了家人和房屋，我们对美国强盗们燃烧着复仇的决心。我们有着克服任何困难、一定要击灭并扫荡最后一个敌人的坚强斗志。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席！
    我们相信美帝国主义者无论怎样挣扎，但是它会像曾在中国遭受过的失败那样，在朝鲜也一定要失败。
    我们永远不能忘记伟大中国人民的援助，我们将在保卫祖国扫荡敌人的斗争中更加勇敢。在与强大的中国人民与我们并肩战斗勇敢前进的前面，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    站在世界和平民主阵营前面的伟大苏联对我们的伟大友谊，更确定了我们的胜利信心。
    为了巩固已得到的胜利并争取新的胜利，我们将更加果敢地展开斗争，同时，我们要更加巩固和伟大的苏联人民以及中国人民为首的各民主国家人民之间的友谊。我们有着坚强的决心像支援我们的人民军一样的支援中国人民志愿部队。最后我们向我们的战友中国人民和您表示诚恳的感谢。庆祝中国人民和您的光辉胜利。

                                    一九五○年十一月二十八日
    满浦县高盖里人民给毛主席的信中国人民的领袖和朝鲜人民亲爱的朋友毛泽东主席：
    我们绝对欢迎并欢呼十一月四日以中国共产党为首的中国各民主党派发表的宣言，我们满浦县满浦区高盖里的全体人民，谨向您和全体中国人民，表示兄弟般的敬意和感谢。
    尊敬的毛泽东主席！
    梦想独霸世界的美帝国主义者，为要达到使我们朝鲜永远变成他们的殖民地和在亚洲的军事战略基地作为反对苏联和中国的根据地的凶恶目的，正继续着野蛮的武装进攻。
    二十世纪中最野蛮的美帝国主义者，以血遍染着我们美丽的河山，将一切高贵的文化遗产和财物变成灰尽。美国侵略者虐待我们的父母和兄弟姊妹。但是，全体朝鲜人民在为祖国的自由和独立的斗争中，像一个人似的站起来了。我们并没有为他们的野蛮武力和暴行所征服，而且也决不可能为他们所征服。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席！
    今天为了祖国的独立自由与和平安全而奋起的朝中人民，像兄弟一样地在胜利斗争中的团结，不仅在朝鲜人民和中国人民的民族解放斗争史上，而且在全亚洲的民族解放斗争史上也是史无前例的创举，并树立了为自由和为民族的独立而斗争的人们的国际联系与战斗性团结的模范。
    因此这就是对于美帝国主义侵略者打下去的铁锤。
    朝中两国人民为祖国独立与自由和全亚洲人民的自由与幸福，并进一步为全世界的和平与安全像钢铁般的团结起来了。在这一团结的力量的面前，帝国主义侵略者任何疯狂进攻都要被阻止的，都要遭到失败的。
    今天，中国兄弟们正在我们的土地上流着正义的鲜血。这将成为朝中两国人民永远亲善的象征，这就更加紧密和巩固了朝中两国人民的团结，并更加鼓舞和坚强了朝鲜人民心脏中跳动着的必胜气概和信念。
    朝鲜人民将把中国兄弟的支援事迹传至子孙万代，永垂不朽。
    我们高盖里全体人民，在下定决心为祖国独立和自由而献出一切力量进行斗争的群众大会上，为全亚洲人民的自由和幸福，并为全世界的和平与安全，敬祝毛泽东主席您万寿无疆！

                                      一九五○年十一月二十六日
    新义州市人民致我国人民志愿军的信亲爱的中国人民志愿军将士们！
    今天我们响应祖国战线的号召文，召开了具有重大意义的奋起大会，向英勇的你们致以衷心的尊敬和光荣。
    亲爱的同志们！
    朝中两国人民在长久的历史上，就有着密切的联系，在反对外国侵略者的共同斗争中的任何时期，我们一向并肩进行了英勇的斗争。
    过去为反对日本帝国主义而进行的斗争中我们在一起，今天在反对美帝国主义的斗争中我们也在一起。
    当梦想以武力征服全世界的美国强盗们向我们祖国和人民开始野兽般的武装侵略时，伟大的中国人民严厉地斥责了美帝的暴行，并高举声援我们朝鲜人民的火把。
    你们为帮助朝鲜人民为保卫你们祖国参加了朝鲜战争，和英勇的我们人民军并肩作战，给予敌人重大的损失。今天的形势已转变得对我们有利了。
    亲爱的战友们！
    我们朝中两国人民紧密地携起手来，在以伟大的苏联为首的全世界民主阵营的旗帜下，勇敢地斗争着，胜利的光辉一定是属于我们的。
    你们流出高贵的鲜血参加正义的战争，我们对这是永远不能忘记的。
    你们打倒了美帝侵略和反动的蒋介石匪帮，统一了四万七千五百万人民的广大中国，这斗争对我们朝鲜人民是一个伟大的榜样。
    敬爱的中国人民志愿部队将士们！
    我们的斗争是为了最后的胜利，更加握紧手勇敢地斗争吧！
    为正义而斗争的你们的前途，充满胜利和光荣。
    英勇的中国人民志愿部队万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝中人民巩固的友谊万岁！

    满蒲县高盖里人民致我国人民志愿军的信英勇的中国人民志愿军将士们！
    在我们争取祖国独立和自由的祖国解放战争正在激烈进行的时候，我们全体朝鲜人民向你们为反对美帝国主义援助朝鲜而自愿奋起参加朝鲜战争的行动，致以全民族的感激，并向你们表示兄弟般的欢迎和最大的荣誉。
    美国强盗们妄想把我们祖国变成它的永久殖民地，变成它的反对苏联和中国的军事侵略基地，以图霸占全世界。它在我们祖国疆土上挑起战争，使我们美丽疆土遍染鲜血，使高贵的文化宝物和贵重的财产变成灰尽，屠杀了我们的父母，我们的兄弟，我们的姊妹。
    可是英勇的朝鲜人民军和爱国的朝鲜人民没有被它们征服，美国强盗永远不能征服朝鲜人民。
    和朝鲜人民有着兄弟友谊的中国人民志愿部队将士们！
    国境邻接的朝中两国民族的利害是一致的，为反对帝国主义侵略者，在争独立和自由的民族解放战争中，朝中两国人民在历史上许多时候都是处于同一的命运中。
    这样，今天朝中两国人民反对妄想侵略朝鲜和中国的共同敌人——美帝，而共同作战是当然的事，也是正义的行动。
    这不仅是在朝中两国人民民族解放斗争史上，而且是在全亚洲民族解放史上划时代的巨大事件，这就是为争取祖国自由和民族独立而斗争的人民的国际团结和战斗性友谊的榜样。
    中国人民优秀的儿女、勇敢无比的中国人民志愿部队将士们！
    你们今天在我们祖国疆土上，流着高贵的正义的鲜血。这一正义行动更加巩固我们朝中两国人民永远的友谊和团结，也更鼓舞了朝鲜人民心脏中鼓动着的灭敌气概和必胜的信念。
    在决定祖国命运的严重时期，我们受到了你们的支援。在我们人民军和你们紧密的并肩作战之下，已经击退了并歼灭了大部的穷凶极恶的美国侵略军。
    以正义和鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的友谊果实和你们光辉的功勋，像千古万代滚着绿色的鸭绿江的水流一样永远发着光辉。
    我们坚决与你们一起斗争到底，我们在这里向你们表示无限的感谢，我们已积极展开支援你们的工作。
    为祖国的独立、自由与和平安全而斗争的中国人民志愿部队永远光荣！
