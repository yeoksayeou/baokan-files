    Destroying the Ideological Influence of the Yiguandao
    — Introducing the Experiences of Educating Deceived Followers in Northeast and North China
    The number of Yiguandao followers nationwide is large, and there is currently no precise statistic. According to investigations, in Shanxi Province, where Yiguandao activities were relatively rampant, there were 810,000 followers. Among these followers, the vast majority were working people. In Shanghua Village, Dai County, Xinxian Special District, Shanxi Province, 74 percent of the middle and poor peasants, totaling 549 people, were members of the sect. Not only among general followers but also among lower-level leaders of the religious sects, working people accounted for a significant proportion. Liaoxi Province once held a training session for 868 lower-level leaders of religious sects, of whom 41 percent were poor and hired peasants, and 30 percent were middle peasants. The motives of working people for joining the sect can be explained by the survey material from Shanghua Village, Dai County, Shanxi Province. Among 502 followers, 230 joined to "avoid disasters and difficulties," 23 sought children, 15 sought cures for illnesses, 45 sought blessings for their children to live long lives, 38 sought to see deceased relatives, 5 sought harmonious families, 42 sought blessings for their sons not to be sacrificed when they joined the army, 72 sought wealth, 21 sought to quit smoking and gambling, and 11 sought blessings for their husbands to return home safely. Although they had various motives, they did not have a counter-revolutionary political conspiracy like the reactionary sect leaders. They were generally deceived into joining the sect because of the existence of feudal and backward superstitious ideas.
    Since Yiguandao is a mass and social superstitious sect manipulated by reactionary sect leaders, eradicating Yiguandao is not only a political struggle but also an ideological struggle. This means that it is necessary not only to destroy the Yiguandao organization manipulated by reactionary sect leaders but also to destroy its ideological influence. Only in this way can we win over the vast number of deceived followers to withdraw from the sect voluntarily and achieve the goal of thoroughly eliminating Yiguandao. Northeast and North China regions have paid full attention to this aspect in the work of eradicating Yiguandao and have provided many experiences.
    To destroy the ideological influence of the Yiguandao, the main method is to carry out universal and in-depth propaganda and education work. The content of the propaganda mainly has two aspects: on the one hand, to expose the crimes of the Yiguandao and enlighten the political consciousness of the followers, and on the other hand, to explain the policies of the People's Government and point out a way out for the followers. Before carrying out the propaganda work, it is necessary to collect sufficient specific materials, preferably vivid local examples. This requires not only collecting the criminal facts of reactionary sect leaders but also understanding the ideological situation of the followers. Some places only paid attention to the former but ignored the latter, which is not right. The forms of propaganda should be diverse, such as newspapers, dramas, radio broadcasts, exhibitions, mass meetings, propaganda teams, seminars, as well as ballad singing, comic dialogues, cartoons, etc., all of which can be utilized. The propaganda methods should be as flexible as possible to attract more followers and the general public, so that they can receive more education. Many places used thoroughly repentant altar masters, transmission masters, and "three talents" (乩童, mediums) to participate in mass meetings in the areas where they used to carry out activities, exposing their past methods of deceiving people, advising everyone not to be fooled again, and publicizing that Yiguandao must be dissolved. The result of using this method in Northeast China was that many religious sects quickly tended to collapse from organization to ideology. Some places mobilized the awakened "three talents" to tell their tricks of deception on the radio, or to participate in propaganda teams, turning the methods of planchette writing and fabricating rumors into dramas, bringing them to the stage, and personally demonstrating and singing. When Northeast China eradicated Yiguandao and all feudal religious sects, it compiled several plays such as "Cannot Be Trusted" and "Been Fooled." The ten theaters in Tianjin simultaneously staged dramas about Yiguandao for more than a month, with crowded audiences totaling 100,000 people. For a time, street talk and discussions all focused on exposing the ugliness of Yiguandao. Some places used the reactionary certificates of Yiguandao, etc., to set up exhibitions of considerable scale, mobilizing men, women, old and young to visit. Some exhibitions even displayed a Buddhist altar in its original form, allowing those altar masters, etc., to perform that set of deceptive tricks. At the exhibition, many followers saw the things they had been extorted, watched the performance of deceptive tricks, listened to the inflammatory explanations of the narrators, and remembered the unjust things of the past, and could not help but curse in anger. This method easily makes followers realize that the government's measures are completely in line with their interests. The exhibition held in the Lushun-Dalian area lasted for ten days, with more than 63,000 visitors. Some places held mass meetings, using the method of accounting to educate the masses. Calculate how much work a person missed in a year after joining the sect to cultivate the Tao and worship Buddha; how much money was spent on burning incense, making offerings, and exempting sins; how much suffering was endured from beatings and scoldings during Tao examinations and demonic tests; how many losses were suffered from seeking children and treating illnesses, and in the end, everything was in vain, and they were also fooled by special agents. This method was widely adopted in Northeast China. When Hebei Province adopted this method, it was combined with the propaganda of production policies, explaining on the one hand how the People's Government leads and helps the masses to work diligently in production, so that everyone's life becomes richer and richer; on the other hand, exposing how the Yiguandao deceives the masses into spending money and wasting work, making everyone's life worse and worse. In addition, all places have adopted methods such as letting the victimized followers recount their sufferings, or organizing the followers to carry out a recall movement, to raise the followers' awareness.
    After the above-mentioned propaganda and education work, most of the long-standing influence of the Yiguandao among the masses has been eliminated. Some followers saw the counter-revolutionary nature of the Yiguandao, and they said: "We thought we were just believing in Buddhism, but it turned out that there were also special agents causing trouble." Some followers recognized the nature of the Yiguandao from all aspects, and even the ghost talk of "the Tao is righteous but the people are evil" was no longer believed. They recognized the truth that "the Tao is evil and the people are also evil," and said: "Wasted work, spent money, sickened and died sons, enriched the Yiguandao, will never believe it again." As a result, people no longer regarded the so-called "immortals and Buddhas" "Master" with a pious mood, but treated the story of the Yiguandao as a joke. As a result, followers declared their withdrawal from the sect one after another. As a result, the sect leaders were completely isolated and had to go to the public security organs to register. Individual reactionary sect leaders who were determined to the end secretly wailed: "Now it is as if the 'devils' have broken everything."
    In places where propaganda and education work is done thoroughly, even if individual reactionary sect leaders who are determined to the end still want to turn to secrecy and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, they have lost their support and face great difficulties. However, some places underestimate the role of propaganda work, did not organize forces well, and did not spend the necessary time to carry out this work, but were only busy with registration work. As a result, many followers did not understand the policies, were afraid of registration, and therefore did not tell the truth or tried to say as little as possible, and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In this way, the reactionary sect leaders believed that there was still a loophole to exploit, so they turned to secrecy and continued to engage in sabotage activities. Therefore, the quality of propaganda and education work largely determines whether the eradication of Yiguandao can be thorough.
    There is no doubt that we must adopt the policy of unity and education for general followers. For general sect leaders, we should also adopt the policy of striving for and transforming them. In this regard, Hebei's experience is successful, which is the method of collective training.
    An important part of the collective training of general sect leaders is to repeatedly explain the policies, explaining that the collective training is to save and transform them. At the beginning of the collective training of general sect leaders in Ding County, most of the sect leaders were afraid of government punishment. Therefore, some pretended to be sick, some falsely reported their positions, and dared not tell the truth. After explaining the policies, some sect leaders wanted to confess, but they were afraid of offending others and being isolated, and they would suffer in the future; at the same time, they were afraid that if the government tracked down the matter, their whole family would be trained. A portion of sect leaders who held deep superstitious ideas were afraid of "being struck by lightning"; however, they also felt that they had to confess, and their inner struggle was very fierce. At this time, the government released seven sect leaders who confessed thoroughly and returned home, and repeatedly explained the policies, which gradually eliminated their concerns.
    In addition to explaining the policies, we can also carry out a recall of suffering movement in the groups through the molecules who are more quickly awakened; and organize the transmission masters who have repented to make confession demonstrations. Finally, we call on everyone to hand over superstitious items, talk about the organization's situation, and stop all illegal activities. These methods have all been proven to be effective.

    摧毁一贯道的思想影响
    ——介绍东北华北各地教育受骗道徒的经验
    全国的一贯道徒很多，现时还没有精确的统计。据调查，在一贯道活动比较猖獗的山西省，道徒有八十一万人。在这些道徒中间，绝大多数是劳动人民。山西忻县专区的代县上花庄，全村中农和贫农的百分之七十四，计五百四十九人在道。不仅在一般道徒中，而且在会道门的下层头目中，劳动人民也占着很大的比例。辽西省曾集训八百六十八个会道门的下层头目，其中贫农和雇农占百分之四十一，中农占百分之三十。劳动人民入道的动机，可以用山西代县上花庄的调查材料作说明，在五百零二名道徒中，为“躲灾避难”而入道的有二百三十人，为求儿女的有二十三人，为治病的十五人，为保祐小孩长命的四十五人，为见死后亲人的三十八人，为和睦家庭的五人，为保祐儿子当兵不牺牲的四十二人，为发财的七十二人，为戒烟赌的二十一人，为保祐丈夫平安回家的十一人。他们虽然有着各种各样的动机，但他们并不像反动的道首那样，有一个反革命的政治阴谋。他们一般是因为存在着封建落后的迷信思想而被骗入道的。
    一贯道既是被操纵在反动道首手中的群众性和社会性的迷信的会门，因而取缔一贯道不仅是一个政治斗争，同时也是一个思想斗争。这就是说，不仅须要摧毁操纵在反动道首手中的一贯道的组织，还必须摧毁它的思想影响，这样才能争取广大受骗道徒自动退道，达到彻底肃清一贯道的目的。这一层，东北、华北各地在取缔一贯道的工作中，都给予了充分的注意，并且提供了不少经验。
    要摧毁一贯道的思想影响，主要方法是进行普遍而深入的宣传教育工作。宣传的内容大致有两个方面，一方面是揭露一贯道的罪恶，启发道徒的政治觉悟，一方面是解释人民政府的政策，给道徒指出一条出路。在进行宣传工作之前，必须搜集充分的具体材料，最好是当地的生动事例。这不仅需要收集反动道首的罪恶事实，并且需要了解道徒的思想状况。有的地方只注意了前者，而忽视了后者，是不对的。宣传的形式应该是多种多样的，例如报纸、戏剧、广播、展览会、群众大会、宣传队、座谈会，以及鼓词、相声、漫画等等，全可以利用。宣传的方法要尽可能的灵活，以便吸引更多的道徒和一般群众，使之受到更多的教育。许多地方利用坦白彻底的坛主、点传师、三才等人，到他们原来进行活动的地区，参加群众大会，揭发自己过去骗人的种种手法，劝告大家不要再上当，并宣传一贯道必须解散。东北利用这种方法的结果，使许多会道门从组织到思想很快趋于破灭。有些地方，动员觉悟了的三才等人，或到广播台上述说自己骗人的诡计，或者参加宣传队，以自己的亲身经历，把扶乩、编造谣言等方法编成戏剧，搬上舞台，现身说法，自演自唱。东北在取缔一贯道及一切封建会道门时，曾编了“信不得”、“上了当”等好几个剧本。天津的十一家戏院，曾同时上演了关于一贯道的戏剧，前后连续达一个多月，观众十分拥挤，总计共十万人。一时街谈巷议，莫不以揭露一贯道的丑恶为话题。有些地方，利用一贯道的反动证件等等，布置了具有相当规模的展览会，发动男女老幼前往参观。有的展览会，还把一个佛坛原封摆出来，让那些坛主等等表演那套骗人的把戏。在展览会上，不少道徒看到自己被勒索去的东西，又看了骗人把戏的表演，听了说明员带有鼓动性的说明，想起过去的冤枉事情，莫不一头火地叫骂不已。这种方法很容易使道徒体会到政府的措施和他们的利益完全一致。旅大区举办的展览会连续十天，观众达六万三千余人。有些地方，举行群众大会，用算账的方法来教育群众。算一算一个人在入道以后，一年当中修道拜佛误了多少工；烧香、上供、免罪等等花了多少钱；道考、魔考挨打挨骂受了多少罪；求子、治病吃了多少亏，结果什么也是一场空，还上了特务的当。这种方法，东北曾普遍采用。河北省在采用这种方法的时候，是结合着宣传生产政策来做的，一方面说明人民政府如何领导与帮助群众勤劳生产，使大家的生活日益富裕；一方面揭露一贯道如何欺骗群众花钱误工，弄得大家生活越来越坏。此外，各地全采用了让受害道徒诉苦，或组织道徒开展回忆运动等方法，来提高道徒的觉悟。
    经过上述的宣传教育工作以后，一贯道长期存在于群众中的影响，多半得到了清除。有的道徒看清了一贯道的反革命性质，他们说：“咱以为光是信佛，原来还有特务捣鬼。”有的道徒从各方面认识了一贯道的性质，连“道正人邪”的鬼话也不相信了。他们认识了“道邪人也邪”的道理，说：“误了工，花了钱，病死了儿子，肥了一贯道，再也不相信了。”这一来，人们不再以虔敬的心情来看待所谓“仙佛”“师尊”，而把一贯道的故事当成了笑料来谈。于是，道徒纷纷申明退道。这一来，道首完全陷于孤立，不得不前往公安机关进行登记。个别死心踏地的反动道首则暗暗叫苦：“而今算是教‘魔鬼’把什么也给弄破了。”
    在宣传教育工作做得深入的地方，个别死心踏地的反动道首虽然还想转入秘密，继续进行反革命活动，但是已经失去依托，困难极大。不过，有些地方对宣传工作的作用估计不足，没有好好组织力量，也没有花费必要的时间来进行这一工作，只是忙于登记工作，结果，不少道徒不了解政策，害怕登记，因而不说实话或者尽量少说，采取了观望态度。这样，反动道首认为还有空子可钻，于是转入秘密，继续从事破坏活动。因此，宣传教育工作的好坏，就大体决定了取缔一贯道是否能够彻底。
    对于一般道徒必须采取团结教育的方针，这是肯定无疑的。对于一般的道首，也应该采取争取与改造的方针。在这一方面，河北的经验是成功的，这就是集训的方法。
    集训一般道首的重要一环，是反复解释政策，说明集训是为了挽救与改造他们。定县在集训一般道首之初，道首多半害怕政府处分，于是，有的装病，有的假报职务，不敢说实话。经过讲解政策之后，有一部分道首想要坦白，但又怕得罪了别人，自己陷于孤立，将来会吃亏；同时又怕政府跟踪追究起来，让全家受训。一部分保有深重迷信思想的道首，则害怕“天打五雷轰”；可是，又觉得不坦白也不行，内心斗争很剧烈。这时，政府把坦白彻底的七个道首释放回家，并再三解释了政策，这才把他们的顾虑逐渐解除了。
    除了讲解政策之外，还可以通过觉悟较快的分子，在小组里展开回忆受害运动；并且组织已经悔悟了的点传师等人作坦白示范。最后号召大家交出迷信用品，谈出组织状况，停止一切非法活动。这些方法全已证明是有效的。
