(Xinhua News Agency, December 6th) Following the crushing defeats suffered by the American invading forces in Korea under the powerful counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, U.S. President Truman issued a statement in Washington on November 30th, brazenly threatening the Chinese people with an expanded war of aggression. This statement has swiftly provoked angry protests from people around the world. People worldwide have expressed their firm support for the Chinese and Korean people and their profound hatred for U.S. imperialism, and are determined to respond to Truman's shameless intimidation by intensifying their struggle to defend peace.

Even within Truman's own country, the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement on December 1st, calling on the American people to take immediate action to stop this warmongering. The statement pointed out: "Now is the time to restrain the hand of U.S. imperialists; not a moment can be lost. No American can sleep soundly tonight unless he joins the worldwide call, demanding peace in unison." According to the New York Worker’s Daily, in the escalating protest movement, tens of thousands of telegrams demanding peace are pouring into the White House. Many mass organizations have decided to send delegations to Lake Success to urge the United Nations to promote a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

In France, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a declaration on the 1st, stating, "All humanity is voicing their protests, indignation, and fury with passionate emotion" in response to Truman's "abominable statement." The French Communist Party called on "all men and women of France, regardless of political opinion or religious belief, to unite and combine their forces to stop this crime." According to Zhukov, a Pravda correspondent in Paris, the protest movement of the French people, under the call of the French Communist Party, is sweeping the country like a storm. Workers in many enterprises in Paris went on strike and held rallies to protest. Millions of workers signed protest declarations circulating in factories, and worker delegations sent these declarations to the U.S. Embassy, the Parliament, and the President.

In Italy, according to the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, on November 30th itself, as soon as the workers heard Truman's statement, they immediately gathered in factories, passed resolutions, and protested. By December 1st, workers in major industrial centers across the country, under the call of the Italian Communist Party, held a short nationwide protest strike. That evening, tens of thousands of people in Rome demonstrated in front of the Parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Local committees for the defense of peace held many mass rallies, and the masses unanimously demanded an end to the aggressive policies of the United States and expressed their determination to fight resolutely for the defense of peace. The municipal councils of Milan, Florence, and Venice have successively expressed their firm support for peace and opposition to Truman's intimidation. Mass rallies were held in Bologna, Treviso, Udine, Padua, Pescara, Teramo, and other cities, demanding that Italy withdraw from the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

In Britain, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, on December 1st, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the CPGB, sent a letter to the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, demanding an end to the war of aggression in Korea, the withdrawal of British troops and all other foreign troops from Korea, and a declaration that Britain would never participate in aggression against China. The Communist Party of Great Britain also called on the entire party to mobilize and organize a powerful mass movement to stop the war of aggression. According to the London Daily Worker, Truman's statement has provoked a storm of protests from working people in factories across London. Protest letters and telegrams from all over the country are flooding Prime Minister Attlee's office. Delegations of workers, doctors, youth groups, and people from all walks of life are flocking to the Prime Minister's residence, demanding that Attlee come forward to oppose Truman's war threats. On the 2nd, mass rallies and demonstrations were held in Coventry and Birmingham. The Birmingham Trades Council, representing 130,000 workers, and the South Wales Miners' Conference, representing all the mines in the South Wales coalfields, unanimously passed resolutions demanding an immediate end to the war of aggression against Korea. A meeting of members of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives in Battersea, South London, resolved to demand an immediate great power conference including the government of the People’s Republic of China.

In West Germany, according to the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a proclamation to the people on the 5th, protesting Truman's new hysterical warmongering, and calling on all German people, regardless of party affiliation, to join the front for peace. The Central Committee pointed out: To the threat of death and destruction, the German people's answer is: to hold rallies in enterprises and trade unions to firmly protest West German rearmament, to oppose the use of atomic weapons, to organize demonstrations for peace in all cities, everything for peace! Everything for German unity!

Progressive people in many other countries have also risen up against Truman's threatening statement. Aksel Larsen, Chairman of the Danish Communist Party, visited Prime Minister Erik Eriksen on the 1st and presented him with the Danish Communist Party's written opinion, requesting "the government to order the Danish delegation to the United Nations to oppose all actions that could expand the war, and to support efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean War, to request the government to express opposition to the use of atomic bombs, and to advocate a five-power conference including the People's Republic of China." Major newspapers in the Netherlands oppose U.S. aggression against Korea and China. The Dutch Communist Party organ De Waarheid declared on the 1st that the Netherlands should no longer stand with the Washington adventurers and demanded an immediate end to aid to the U.S. aggressors. The Swedish Communist Party organ Ny Dag wrote on the 1st that the Swedish people must ensure that no one abuses their name to support the plan of U.S. financial tycoons to wage a war of aggression against China, thereby paving the way for world war. Hernán Laborde, General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party, said that the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers meant defending the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, which was threatened by U.S. aggression. Lombardo Toledano, Secretary of the Confederation of Mexican Workers, Garcia, Secretary of the Mexican Miners, Metalworkers and Allied Workers Union, and several well-known Mexican artists, also unanimously condemned the U.S. threats to expand the war of aggression. On the 1st, the people of Sydney, Australia, held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate General against U.S. war threats, despite the police's brutal suppression.

According to the Warsaw Daily, "Just as MacArthur's 'general offensive' in Korea has met with a powerful counter-offensive from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, Truman's threat has resulted in a strong counter-offensive from world public opinion. This counter-offensive has caused great panic and confusion in the camp of the war-mongers."

    全世界人民抗议杜鲁门声明引起战争贩子阵营巨大恐慌
    【新华社六日讯】美国总统杜鲁门由于侵朝美军在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的大反攻下惨遭失败，而于十一月三十日在华盛顿发表声明，叫嚣以扩大侵略战争威胁中国人民。这个声明已迅速在全世界人民中引起了愤怒抗议。全世界人民已表示了对中朝人民的坚决支援和对美帝国主义的深刻仇恨，并决心以加紧保卫和平的斗争，来回答杜鲁门的无耻恫吓。
    就在杜鲁门的本国，美国共产党全国委员会于十二月一日即发表声明，号召美国人民立即行动，制止这种战争狂。声明指出：“要制止美帝国主义者的手，现在就是时候了，片刻也不能放过。美国人今晚谁也不能够安睡，除非他参加全世界的呼号，齐声要求和平。”据纽约工人日报报道，在日益扩大的抗议运动中，成千成万要求和平的电报不断地涌向白宫，许多群众团体决定派遣代表团去成功湖，呼吁联合国促进和平解决朝鲜问题。
    在法国，法国共产党中央委员会于一日发表宣言，指出：“全人类正在激动情绪下发出他们抗议、愤慨和激怒的呼声”，来回答杜鲁门的“令人憎恶的声明”。法国共产党号召“所有法兰西的男女不分政治意见和宗教信仰，一致起来反对，并团结他们的力量来制止这种罪行。”在法共号召下，法国人民的抗议运动，据真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫称，如同暴风雨一般席卷全国各地。巴黎许多企业的工人都罢工集会表示抗议，千万工人在工厂中传递着的抗议宣言上签了名，工人代表团把这些宣言送给美国大使馆，送给议会和总统。
    在意大利，据电通社报道，就在十一月三十日当天，当工人们一听到杜鲁门的声明时，就马上在工厂里集会，通过决议，提出抗议。至十二月一日，全国各大工业中心的工人，在意大利共产党号召下举行了短时间的全国性抗议罢工。当天晚上，罗马有成千上万的人民在议会和外交部前面举行示威。各地方保卫和平委员会举行了许多群众大会，与会群众一致要求制止美国的侵略政策，并表示为保卫和平而坚决斗争的意志。米兰、佛罗伦萨和威尼斯的市政委员会已相继表示坚决拥护和平，反对杜鲁门的威吓。波伦亚、特累威索、乌地内、巴图亚、贝斯加拉、特拉摩等城市都举行了群众集会，要求意大利退出以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团。
    在英国，英国共产党总书记波立特已于十二月一日代表英共执行委员会致函工党执行委员会，要求停止侵略朝鲜的战争，撤退在朝鲜的英军及其他一切外国军队，并宣布英国决不参与对中国的侵略。英国共产党并号召全党总动员进行组织强大的群众运动来阻止侵略战争。据伦敦工人日报报道，杜鲁门声明已引起伦敦各工厂劳动人民的暴风雨般的抗议。来自全国各地的抗议函电，如雪片一般向艾德礼首相发来。工人、医生、青年团体等各界人士的代表团，络绎不绝地来到首相官邸门前，要求艾德礼出面反对杜鲁门的战争恫吓。二日在考文垂和北明翰举行了群众大会和示威。代表十三万工人的北明翰工会委员会，代表南威尔士矿区一切矿场的南威尔士矿区会议，都一致通过要求立即停止对朝鲜进行侵略战争的决议。伦敦南部巴特西地方全国建筑业工人联合会会员举行的会议，决议要求立即举行包括中华人民共和国政府在内的大国会议。
    在西德，据德意志通讯社消息，德国共产党中央委员会已于五日发表告人民书，抗议杜鲁门战争歇斯底里的新叫嚣，并号召全体德国人民不分党派一致参加为和平而斗争的阵线。中央委员会指出：对于死亡和毁灭的威胁，德国人民的回答是：在各企业和工会中集会坚决抗议西德重新军事化，反对使用原子武器，在所有城市中组织争取和平的示威游行，一切为和平！一切为德国统一！
    在其他许多国家内的进步人民，也奋起反对杜鲁门的恫吓声明。丹麦共产党主席拉荪于一日往访总理伊里克逊，向他提出了丹共的意见书，要求“政府命令丹麦驻联合国代表团反对一切能使战争扩大的行动，并支持谋求和平解决朝鲜战事的努力，要求政府表示反对使用原子弹，并主张举行包括中华人民共和国在内的五大国会议。”荷兰的主要报纸都反对美国侵略朝鲜和中国。荷兰共产党机关报真理报一日宣称：荷兰不应再与华盛顿冒险家站在一起，并要求立即停止援助美国侵略者。瑞典共产党机关报《新时代》报一日称：瑞典人民必须保证不叫别人滥用他们的名义去支持美国金融巨头对中国进行侵略战争的计划，从而为世界大战开拓道路。墨西哥共产党总书记思西那说：中国人民志愿部队的参战，也就是保卫了遭受美国侵略威胁的中华人民共和国的主权。墨西哥劳工联合总会书记涅托、墨西哥矿工、金属工人及各业工人联盟总书记加西亚和若干墨西哥闻名的艺术家，也都一致斥责美国威胁扩大侵略战争的叫嚣。澳大利亚悉尼人民于一日不顾警察的横暴镇压，在美国总领事馆门前举行了反对美国战争恫吓的示威。
    据波兰《华沙报》指出：“正如麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的‘总攻势’遭到朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的强大还击一样，杜鲁门的威胁的结果，引起了世界舆论的强大反攻。这个反攻已在战争贩子的阵营中造成了巨大的恐慌与混乱。”
