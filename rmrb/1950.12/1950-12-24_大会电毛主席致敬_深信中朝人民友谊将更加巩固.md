    Meeting Sends Respects to Chairman Mao
    Deeply Believes the Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People Will Be Further Consolidated
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Pyongyang delayed dispatch: The Pyongyang City Celebration of Liberation Meeting sent the following message of respect to Chairman Mao: To the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong:
    Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Pyongyang has finally been liberated from the enemy's occupation. Today, the Pyongyang citizens' celebration of liberation meeting expresses its highest gratitude and honor to you.
    For the past month and a half, we have groaned under the iron heel of the brutal enemy; now, we can once again enjoy a happy life under the banner of the Republic. The American imperialist bandits have destroyed and ravaged our culture with a long history of five thousand years, brutally destroying and looting our factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, and residences built with blood and sweat, and slaughtering or raping our parents, brothers, sisters, and children. We must take revenge and completely eliminate the enemy.
    In the just struggle to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of our motherland, the Korean people have received support from the world's peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union and including the People's Republic of China. We are filled with the confidence of victory. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world.
    Dear Chairman Mao! We will resolutely and actively carry out the work of supporting the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are advancing forward. We firmly believe that the permanent friendship between the Korean and Chinese people will be further consolidated. Here, we respectfully wish you, the great leader of the Chinese people, a long life.
          Pyongyang City Liberation Celebration Meeting
              December 11th

    大会电毛主席致敬
    深信中朝人民友谊将更加巩固
    【新华社二十三日讯】平壤迟到消息：平壤市庆祝解放大会给毛主席的致敬电：中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席：
    由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的英勇斗争，平壤终于从敌人的侵占下重获解放。今天，平壤市民的庆祝解放大会向您致以崇高的感谢和荣誉。
    在过去的一个半月中，我们呻吟在残暴敌人的铁蹄下；现在，又能在共和国的旗帜下重度幸福的生活了。美帝国主义强盗破坏、蹂躏了我们具有五千年悠久历史的文化，残暴地破坏和掠夺我们用血汗筑成的工厂、企业、学校、医院、住宅，对我们的父母兄弟姊妹和孩子们进行屠杀或奸淫。我们一定要复仇，要把敌人完全消灭。
    我们朝鲜人民在保卫祖国的独立、自由和荣誉的正义斗争中，得到以苏联为首的有中华人民共和国参加的全世界和平民主阵营的支援。我们充满着必胜的信心。我们深信胜利必定属于朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民。
    亲爱的毛泽东主席！我们将坚决而积极地进行支援向前进攻的人民军和中国人民志愿军的工作。我们深信朝、中两国人民永久的友谊将更加巩固。在此，我们敬祝您、中国人民的伟大领袖万寿无疆。
          平壤市解放庆祝大会
              十二月十一日
