    Keshan Farm's Leadership Style Urgently Needs Improvement
    To the Editor:
    The Gu Chengqu Farm in Keshan County, Heilongjiang, has consistently been detached from the masses in its work over the past few years. Especially after Zhou Huanan took office as farm manager in 1949, the serious bureaucratic style has greatly affected the work. In 1949 and 1950 alone, waste and losses amounted to more than 680 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below).
    Due to the lack of planning for production, there was a shortage of 45 *shi* of rice seeds when it was time to plant rice this spring. Under these circumstances, the farm used ordinary rice as seeds and distributed them to the farmers, resulting in not a single seedling emerging, which not only wasted 45 *shi* of rice seeds but also wasted manpower and money on 45 *qing* of land. This autumn, the farm planned to reclaim wasteland without asking for instructions from higher authorities, and just started doing it haphazardly. After spending 16 million yuan to repair 30 wasteland reclamation machines, only three were used for one day before work stopped, which wasted another 16 million yuan. This autumn, the farm wanted to plant willow strips. With the approval of the Agricultural Section of the Keshan County Government, they were allowed to cut half a *qing* of state-owned willow strips. However, the farm did not plan well and contracted the cutting to the masses at 600 yuan per bundle. In order to earn more money, the masses aimed for speed and quantity, cutting 11,000 bundles at once, covering more than five *qing* of land, exceeding the number approved by the county government tenfold. The cartage fee for transporting the strips was even allowed to be offset by the strips. When it was not enough to offset the cartage fee, Manager Zhou even asked the masses to cut some more, and the villagers took this opportunity to cut quite a bit. The state-owned willow strips are strictly prohibited from being felled indiscriminately, and the county government has long had clear regulations. Farm Manager Zhou Huanan, as an administrative leader, disregarded government laws and cut them so recklessly; moreover, after cutting them, not a single tree was planted.
    The farm manager does not go down to check the work, and the cadres' work is careless, which also causes great losses. Last year's harvest was not good, and many rice-growing workers' families moved away this spring. When they moved, no one in the farm managed the process, resulting in a lot of wood and other equipment in many rooms being removed and taken away, causing serious damage. When new households moved in this spring, they could not live in the houses, and it cost more than 20 million yuan to repair them again. When dividing grain with the rice-growing households last winter, the quality was not checked according to specifications, and both good and bad were accepted. As a result, when delivering rice to the trading company, as many as 200,000 *jin* did not meet the standards. Last year, the farm did not pay attention to how to stack the rice straw from more than 600 *qing* of land. As a result, the stacks were crooked and messy, causing the stacks to leak when it rained, resulting in the loss of more than 200,000 *jin* of straw, worth more than 100 million yuan.
    Other waste on the farm is also very serious. For example, 30 rice threshing machines were bought back from Bei'an for 51 million yuan, but none of them worked well. Manager Zhou neither made efforts to find someone to repair them, nor did he find someone to take care of them, and just threw them outside. In addition, many large carts were ordered from Qiqihar for use in the autumn harvest, but after the contract was signed, there was no follow-up, and as a result, the carts arrived more than ten days late. The rice was left in the field, and many were eaten by wild ducks and sparrows. It is estimated that the loss is worth more than 100 million yuan.
    In addition, the farm does not accept reasonable suggestions. For example, last year, the millstone in the farm's rice mill broke down. Technician Fu Guolin suggested to Manager Zhou to repair it, but Manager Zhou said: "Just make do with it!" Soon enough, a 20-horsepower millstone burned out, resulting in a loss of more than 100 million yuan. The total loss of all the above amounts to 680 million yuan.
    The Keshan County Government has inspected and helped with the errors that Farm Manager Zhou Huanan has made in his leadership work and put forward suggestions for improvement, but Manager Zhou has repeatedly emphasized objective reasons and has not humbly examined himself. In this regard, we believe that Manager Zhou should conduct a thorough review to regain the bad influence among the masses and prevent the loss of national assets.

### 克山农场领导作风急需改进

    克山农场领导作风急需改进编辑同志：
    黑龙江克山县古城区农场，几年来的工作一贯是脱离群众的。特别是在一九四九年周化南担任场长以后，严重的官僚主义作风更使工作受到很大影响。光一九四九、五○两年内就浪费和损失了六亿八千多万元（东北币，下同）。
    由于，对生产缺乏计划，今春临种稻时，尚缺四十五石稻种。在此情况下，场方就用普通稻子当稻种发给农民，结果一棵苗都没有出来，不仅浪费了四十五石稻子，而且还白白的浪费了四十五垧地的人马工钱。今秋打算开秋荒没向上级请示，马马虎虎就动手干起来。花了一千六百万元，修好三十台开荒机，结果就使用三台开了一天就停工了，这样又浪费了一千六百万元。今秋，农场要栽植柳条，经克山县府农业科批准割半垧国有柳条。但场方并没很好计划，以每捆六百元包给群众割，群众为了多挣钱，图快图捆多，一次割了一万一千捆足有五垧多地，超过县府批准数目的十倍。拉条子的车脚钱，还允许拿条子抵。不够抵车脚钱，周场长又叫群众自己再割点，老乡们就乘这机会割去不少。国有柳条，严禁滥伐，县府早有明令规定。周化南场长身为行政领导人，竟不顾政府法令，如此乱割；而且割完还一棵没栽。
    场长不深入及下边检查工作，干部工作粗枝大叶，也造成很大损失。去年收成不好，今春搬走很多种稻子工人家属。临搬时，场里没人经管，致使好多房间里的木料等设备被起掉拿走，破坏很厉害。今春搬进新户时不能住，重新修理又花了两千多万元。去冬和种稻户分粮时，马马虎虎没按规格检查质量，好坏都收，结果向贸易公司交稻子时，足有二十万斤不合标准。去年农场六百多垧地的稻草，如何堆垛，该场亦未重视，结果垛的又歪又乱，以致下雨漏了垛，损失了二十多万斤草，值一亿多元。
    该场其他浪费也很严重。如在北安花五千一百万元买回三十台打稻机，一台也不好使，周场长既没抓紧找人修理，也不找专人保管，扔在外边不管。另外在齐市订购许多台大车供秋收拉地使用，但订约之后，也不督促，结果到拉地时，车晚到十多天。稻子扔在地里，被野鸭、山雀吃了不少，估计损失也值一亿多元。
    此外，该场又不接受合理建议。如：去年农场的制米厂电磙发生故障，技师傅国林向周场长建议修理，但周场长说：“对付着干吧！”不久果然一个二十马力的电磙烧坏了，损失一亿多元。以上总计共损失六亿八千多万元。
    该场场长周化南在领导工作中所存在的这些错误，曾经克山县府检查帮助，并提出改进意见，但周场长一再强调客观原因，并不虚心检查。对此，我们认为周场长应进行彻底的检讨，以挽回在群众中的不良影响，以及国家资财不再遭受损失。
