Beijing No. 7 District Elementary School Teachers
Hold Anti-American Aggression Rally
Denounce American Imperialist Atrocities, and Resolve to Resist America and Aid Korea

[This newspaper reports] On November 25th, elementary school teachers in Beijing's No. 7 District held a "Defend World Peace, Oppose American Imperialist Aggression Propaganda Rally." At the meeting, they performed literary and artistic programs about resisting America and aiding Korea, and three teachers denounced the atrocities of Japanese bandits and American imperialists. Shi Hexiang, a teacher from Yingfang Elementary School, took the stage and, after denouncing the atrocities of Japanese imperialism, pointed to the knife scar on his neck left by the Japanese bandits and shouted to everyone, "Only by taking active action to oppose imperialist aggression can we avoid the suffering of being a subjugated people!" Xiao Yuhe, a female teacher from Lida Elementary School, then denounced one of the thousands of atrocities committed by American imperialists after the Japanese surrendered. Her sister-in-law took her four children on the Beining Railway train to Jinzhou to find her brother. When the train arrived in Tangshan, a team of American soldiers boarded. After getting on the train, they deliberately shot at the farmers in the fields outside the train. When the train reached a stone bridge, a team of American soldiers was stationed under the bridge. Hearing the gunshots, this team of American soldiers immediately fired back at the carriages. They were just joking around, but her sister-in-law's head was shattered by a bullet and she died instantly on the train; brain matter and blood splattered all over the walls of the carriage. After repeated negotiations, the matter was never resolved! Listening to this, many teachers shed tears in anger. When Li Shoushan, an old teacher from Mu De Elementary School, went up to denounce, he was already choked with sobs. He recounted that as far back as 1933, American soldiers in Dongjiaomin Lane had brutally beaten a Chinese merchant to death for no reason. At that time, the police of French and Belgian imperialism were also helping the criminals, not allowing the Chinese to save him. Li Shoushan clenched his fists and asked with passionate anger, "The Japanese kill us, and the Americans come and kill us again. Can the Chinese be trampled on like this?" These three ordinary but true denunciations, along with a report by Zheng Zhixue, an overseas Chinese student from Indonesia, made the teachers understand even more that American imperialism had a blood feud with the Chinese people. Everyone thought with deep sorrow, "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" At the same time, they unanimously resolved to turn grief and anger into strength, work hard, and take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. (Bin)

    控诉美帝暴行决心抗美援朝
    【本报讯】十一月二十五日，京市七区小学教师举行了一个“保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略宣传大会”。会上，表演了抗美援朝文艺节目，并有三个教师控诉了日寇和美帝的暴行。营房小学教师时鹤祥上台控诉了日本帝国主义的暴行后，指着颈上被日寇砍的刀痕向大家喊：“只有用积极行动来反对帝国主义侵略，才能免受亡国奴的痛苦！”立达小学女教师萧玉禾接着控诉了日寇投降后，美帝千万件暴行中的一件。她嫂子带了四个孩子坐北宁路火车到锦州找她哥哥。火车开到唐山，即上来一队美军。他们上车后，即故意向车外田地中农民打靶。车子开到一个石桥，桥下驻有美军一队。这队美军听到枪声，竟即向车厢还击。他们双方这一嬉戏不要紧，她嫂子的后脑壳便被子弹击碎了，立即惨死在车上；脑浆、血水溅满车壁。而这事经再三交涉，最后竟不了了之！教师们听着，很多人气愤地掉下眼泪。穆德小学老教师李守山上去控诉时，他自己已哽咽不能成声。他讲述远在一九三三年，美军在东交民巷无故活活打死了一个中国商人。当时法比帝国主义的警察还在旁边帮凶，不让中国人去救。李守山握紧着拳头激昂地问：“日本人杀我们，美国人来又杀我们，中国人就能这样随便被蹂躏吗？”这三个平凡的，但是真实事实的控诉，和一个印尼华侨学生郑之学的报告，使教师们更加了解了美帝国主义和中国人民有着血海深仇。每个人都沉痛地想着：“血债是要用血来偿还的！”同时一致决心要化悲愤为力量，努力作好工作，以实际行动抗美援朝。（斌）
