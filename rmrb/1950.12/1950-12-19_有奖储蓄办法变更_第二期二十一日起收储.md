    Changes to Prize Savings Scheme
    Second Phase Begins Accepting Deposits on the 21st

    The Beijing People's Bank, having accepted the opinions of many citizens, has decided to shorten the term of the prize savings scheme from the original six months to three months. The prize amounts and the number of prizes have also been changed. The two supplementary prizes have been eliminated, and the last prize has been reduced from the original three thousand to two thousand. The total number of prizes is two thousand one hundred and thirteen, with an average winning opportunity of one in every 47.3 numbers. The first prize has been increased to 3 million yuan, while the second, third, fourth, and last prizes remain the same, at 1 million yuan, 500,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan respectively. The interest for the original six-month deposit was 200 yuan, and is now 100 yuan for a three-month deposit. The second phase of prize bonds will be available for deposit from the 21st of this month. Citizens can go to the bank's various offices, as well as designated post offices and private banks for deposit services.
