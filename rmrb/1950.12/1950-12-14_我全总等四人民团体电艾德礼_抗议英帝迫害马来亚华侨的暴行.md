Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The All-China Federation of Trade unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and All-China Students' Federation jointly telegraphed British Prime Minister Attlee in London on the 12th, protesting the British imperialist atrocities against overseas Chinese in Malaya. The telegram reads as follows: We express extreme indignation and lodge a serious protest against the British colonial authorities' barbaric and unreasonable large-scale arrest, imprisonment, torture, torment, and expulsion of innocent overseas Chinese workers, youth, and women in Malaya. This shameful behavior of the British government precisely exposes the two-faced policy long played by the British imperialists: on the one hand, demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations with New China, and on the other hand, consistently and despicably following the US imperialists in resolutely opposing the Chinese people. The 500 million people of China firmly support the appeals of overseas Chinese in Malaya. We seriously warn the British government and the Malayan colonial authorities to immediately stop this large-scale expulsion of overseas Chinese, compensate for all losses of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese due to the persecution of the Malayan British authorities, immediately release all persecuted overseas Chinese in concentration camps and prisons, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future, otherwise you will suffer the consequences of your own actions.

    抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨的暴行
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会及中华全国学生联合会，于十二日联合致电伦敦英国首相艾德礼，抗议英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨的暴行。电文如下：我们对于英国殖民当局蛮横无理地大批逮捕、监禁、酷刑、折磨和驱逐无辜马来亚华侨工人、青年和妇女的暴行，表示极端的愤怒，并提出严重的抗议。英国政府的这种可耻行为，恰巧暴露了英帝国主义者长期玩弄的两面政策：一方面要求与新中国建立外交关系，另一方面又一贯地随着美帝国主义坚决与中国人民为敌的卑鄙手法。全中国五亿人民坚决支持马来亚侨胞的呼吁。我们严重警告英国政府和马来亚殖民地当局应立即停止这种大批驱逐华侨的暴行，赔偿华侨由于马来亚英国当局的迫害而遭受的一切生命财产损失，并立即释放集中营及监狱中一切被迫害的华侨，保证以后不再发生同样事件，否则你们将自食其果。
