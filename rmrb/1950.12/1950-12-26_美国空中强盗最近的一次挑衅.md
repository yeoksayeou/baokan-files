    Another Provocation by American Air Robbers
    On November 11th, a Soviet passenger plane carrying Maurice Thorez, the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, from Paris to Moscow for medical treatment, was attacked by American jet fighters over Frankfurt am Main, West Germany. Fortunately, thanks to the ingenuity and composure of the Soviet pilot, a tragedy was averted.
    The bourgeois newspapers are trying to defend the American air robbers, but even these newspapers cannot hide the fact that this act was an attempt to assassinate Thorez. For example, "France Libre-soir" said that the attack on the Soviet passenger plane was due to the Americans supposedly testing new radar equipment at the time. This "explanation" is clearly untenable and merely exposes the true nature of the imperialist criminals it intends to defend.
    Democratic people all over the world, all honest people, believe that the attack on the passenger plane by American fighter planes was an attempt to murder Thorez and a continuation of the terror activities of the American imperialists in persecuting democratic forces and Communist Parties, especially their leaders.
    The whole world knows that in order to implement their mad plan for world hegemony, the American imperialists have gone from preparing for aggression to carrying out aggression, from persecuting communists and democrats and police atrocities to naked terror. In these aspects of anti-democratic searching "art" and the "skills" of dark terror methods of assassinating political enemies, the American reactionaries have surpassed their spiritual ancestors, the Hitler fascists. The latest technological achievements, including jet fighters, are being used by the American espionage agency to murder the best and most selfless fighters for peace. The US State Department and the US military are now at the disposal of brutal robbers and murderers whose poisonous claws extend to many countries in Europe and Asia. Truman announced this summer that the United States would launch an "anti-communist movement" in every country in the world.
    It is the American imperialists who instigated the murder of Comrade Lahaut, clamoring to exterminate communists and extinguish communism. The hired murderers who attempted to assassinate Comrades Togliatti, Tokuda Kyuichi, and Duclos had blood-stained US dollars in their pockets. The executioners Tito and Franco, who are slaughtering Yugoslav and Spanish communists, are directly encouraged by Wall Street; the most reactionary fellows who were driven out by the people in countries where the imperialist shackles have been smashed are sheltered in the United States.
    At the same time, the best people in the United States—communists and all sincere democrats—are being persecuted, thrown into prisons and concentration camps. In his telegram congratulating Thorez on his 50th birthday, Comrade Stalin wrote: "People of all nations and workers of all countries know and respect you as the long-tested leader of the French Communist Party, the leader of the French workers and working peasants, and the heroic fighter for consolidating peace and striving for democracy and socialism to triumph throughout the world."
    Thorez, this courageous fighter for peace, was the first to declare: "The French people will never fight against the Soviet Union!" Because of Thorez's strong perseverance, his great organizational activities, and his loyalty to the cause of the working people, he is respected by the entire working-class movement and warmly loved by the French working class and people. It is precisely because of these excellent qualities, because of this lofty struggle, that the American imperialists hate Thorez so much. The reactionary newspapers have more than once vilely clamored to murder Thorez. Only because of the vigilance of the Party and the vigilance of the working class, Thorez is protected and the enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism are unable to murder him.
    The protest of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party said: "The reason why the United States wants to murder Thorez is because Thorez was the first to expose the dangerous consequences of American interference in French internal affairs, because he was the first to point out that this is a matter of turning France into a colony and preparing for an anti-Soviet war. The masters want to set an example for their slaves. But they must consider the vigilance of the French people, who will act together to stop the hands of the criminals. All working people and peace fighters will express their indignation and show their determination to stop the colonization of France and stop the acts that humiliate France."
    The fascist villains who have raised their heads are not only threatening communists. They are threatening all honest people who bravely fight against the warmongers. Three days after the American fighter plane attacked the plane carrying Thorez, that is, on November 14th, a plane carrying the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, Leryrip, Toledano, etc., to Warsaw to attend the Second World Peace Congress was severely damaged at Bourget Airport near Paris. Thanks to the vigilance of the Polish flight crew, a tragedy was averted.
    All these facts prove that the vigilance and organization of the working class must be further enhanced. The imperialists should and will be met with the retaliation they deserve.
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party has called on all organizations of the Party to increase their vigilance in order to defeat the evil plans of the American imperialists and their French lackeys. The working people in many enterprises in France have temporarily stopped work to protest the terrorist acts of the American imperialists and sent representatives to protest this despicable attempt to murder to the American diplomatic envoys. People all over the world share the indignation of the French people. The Hungarian newspaper *Free People* wrote: "The attempt to murder Comrade Thorez is a despicable political banditry and a hideous manifestation of the cowardice, cruelty, and shamelessness of the imperialist world. The Hungarian people, together with peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world, denounce this new crime of the warmongers with deep contempt and intense indignation."
    In response to this evil conspiracy of the imperialists, the working class will pay more attention to their glorious leaders, who devote their whole hearts and minds, and even their lives, to the happiness of the working people and the happiness of all nations. Communists cannot be intimidated, because the truth is on their side and the future belongs to them.

    美国空中强盗最近的一次挑衅
    搭载法国共产党总书记多列士由巴黎前往莫斯科就医的苏联客机一架，于十一月十一日途经西德美因河法兰克福上空时，竟受美国喷气战斗机的袭击。幸赖苏联驾驶员的机智与镇静，才得以避免演成惨祸。
    资产阶级的报章力图为美国的空中强盗辩护，可是，甚至这些报章也隐瞒不了事实；这种行为是企图杀害多列士的。例如，“震旦与自由法兰西报”说什么这次袭击苏联的客机，是由于当时美国人据说是正在试验新的雷达设备。这种“解释”显然是说不通的，徒然暴露了它所打算辩护的帝国主义罪犯的真情。
    全世界的民主人士，所有正直的人民都认为美国战斗机对客机的袭击，是企图谋害多列士，是美帝国主义者迫害民主力量，迫害共产党，首先迫害它们的领袖的那种恐怖活动的继续。
    全世界都知道，美帝国主义者为了要贯彻他们的独霸世界的疯狂计划，已经由准备侵略进而实行侵略，由对共产党人和民主人士加以迫害和警察暴行演变为赤裸裸的恐怖。反民主的搜捕“艺术”，暗杀政敌的黑暗恐怖手法的“技巧”，在这些方面，美国反动派已经比他们精神上的祖先希特勒法西斯分子更胜一筹了。最新的技术上的成就，包括喷气战斗机在内，都被美国谍报处利用来谋害最优秀的、无我的争取和平的斗士。美国国务院和美国的军队现在都在供凶残的强盗和杀人凶手驱使，这些强盗和凶手的毒爪伸张到欧洲和亚洲的许多国家。杜鲁门在今年夏天就曾经宣布，美国将在全世界的每一个国家发动“反共运动”。
    主使谋杀拉豪特同志的，尖声叫嚷要灭绝共产党人，扑灭共产主义的就是美帝国主义者。企图杀害托里亚蒂、德田球一和杜克洛诸同志的受雇的凶手，口袋里有的是血迹斑斑的美元。正在屠杀南斯拉夫和西班牙共产党人的刽子手铁托和佛朗哥，直接得到了华尔街的鼓励；在帝国主义的枷锁已经被粉碎了的国家里，给人民赶了出去的最反动的家伙，在美国得到了庇护。
    与此同时，美国的最优秀的人们——共产党人和一切真诚的民主人士——却横遭迫害，被投入牢狱和集中营。斯大林同志在祝贺多列士五十寿辰的电文中写道：“全世界各族人民，各国的工人都知道你和尊敬你，认为你是法国共产党的久经考验的领袖，你是法国工人和劳动农民的领袖，你是巩固和平，争取民主与社会主义在全世界胜利的英勇的战士。”
    多列士这位勇敢的和平斗士，第一个起来宣布：“法国人民绝不对苏联作战！”由于多列士的坚强的毅力，他的伟大的组织活动，他对于劳动人民事业的忠诚，他是整个工人阶级运动所敬重和法国工人阶级和人民所热烈爱戴的。正是由于他的这些优秀的品质，由于这种崇高的斗争，所以美帝国主义者恨死了多列士。反动报章曾不止一次卑污地叫嚣要对多列士下毒手。只是因为党的警惕，工人阶级的警惕保卫着多列士，和平、民主与社会主义的敌人才无法谋害他的生命。
    法国共产党中央委员会的抗议说：“美国之所以要谋害多列士，就是因为多列士第一个起来揭露美国干涉法国内政的危险后果，因为他第一个指出这是使法国沦为殖民地和准备反苏维埃战争的问题。主子们想给他们的奴才们作一个榜样。但是他们必须考虑法国人民的警惕性，法国人民必将一致行动起来制止住罪犯的手。所有的劳动人民与和平斗士们将表示他们的义愤，表明他们有决心制止法国的殖民地化，制止污辱法国的行为。”
    已经抬起头来的法西斯恶棍，不仅仅威胁着共产党人。他们威胁着所有大无畏地与战争贩子搏斗的正直的人们。在美国战斗机袭击了搭载多列士的客机之后三天，即是在十一月十四日，搭载世界工会联合会领袖赛扬，勒里普，托列达诺等人前往华沙出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的一架飞机又在巴黎附近的布尔日机场被严重损坏。幸赖波兰飞行人员的警惕，才得以避免了一次惨祸。
    所有这些事实证明必须更加提高工人阶级的警惕心和组织性。帝国主义者应该而且必将受到应得的反击。
    法国共产党中央委员会已号召党的一切组织提高它们的警惕性，以便打败美帝国主义者及其法国走狗的罪恶计划。法国许多企业中的劳动人民曾临时停工抗议美帝国主义者的恐怖行为，并派出代表向美国外交使节抗议这种谋杀的卑鄙企图。全世界的人民都与法国人民同表愤慨。匈牙利报纸《自由人民》写道：“谋害多列士同志的企图是可鄙的政治土匪行为，是帝国主义世界的怯懦、残暴和无耻的一种狰狞的表现。匈牙利人民和全世界爱和平爱自由的人民一起，怀着深深的鄙视和激昂的义愤，痛斥战争贩子的这一新的罪行。”
    为了回答帝国主义者这种罪恶的诡谋，工人阶级将更加关心他们的光荣的领袖，这些领袖们全心全力，甚至不惜以自己的生命为劳动人民谋幸福，为各族人民谋幸福。共产党人是吓不倒的，因为真理是在他们那一边，未来是属于他们的。
