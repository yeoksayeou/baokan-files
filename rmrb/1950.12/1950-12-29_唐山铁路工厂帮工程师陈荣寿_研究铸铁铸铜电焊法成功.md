    Tangshan Railway Factory Helps Engineer Chen Rongshou
    Successfully Researches Cast Iron and Cast Copper Electric Welding Method
    [Report from this newspaper] Tangshan Railway Factory helped engineer Chen Rongshou successfully research the cast iron and cast copper electric welding method. This electric welding method can weld various cast iron and cast copper mechanical parts, overcoming the waste of manpower and materials, reducing costs, and increasing work efficiency by more than three times. The Ministry of Railways has awarded him a bonus of one million yuan.
    The electric welding used in the factory in the past could only weld copper and iron parts, but not cast copper and cast iron parts. Assistant engineer Chen Rongshou, based on his experience working in the foundry, was determined to study the electric welding of cast copper and cast iron. In April of this year, he submitted a proposal to the Rationalization Proposal Committee. After obtaining approval, he began research. He looked for various relevant reference books and combined them with his own experience. After seven months of research and three experiments, he finally succeeded. The quality of the welded work meets the standards, and it is especially suitable for welding hemp iron. During the research process and experiments, the experiments were carried out by Du Lianyou, an electric welder from the undercarriage shop. He enthusiastically contributed his technical experience to help the research, and played a certain role in the successful research of this electric welding method.

    唐山铁路工厂帮工程师陈荣寿
    研究铸铁铸铜电焊法成功
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂帮工程师陈荣寿，研究铸铁铸铜电焊法获成功。这种电焊法可以接焊各种铸铁铸铜的机械配件，克服了人力物力的浪费，降低成本、提高工作效率都在三倍以上。铁道部已奖给他一百万元的奖金。
    该厂过去所用的电焊，只能焊铜铁件，不能焊铸铜铸铁等配件。帮工程师陈荣寿根据他在铸工场工作的经验，决心要钻研焊铸铜铸铁的电焊，本年四月，即向合理化建议委员会提出建议，在取得同意后，就开始研究。他找了各种有关的参考书籍，和自己的经验结合在一起，经过七个月的钻研，和三次试验，终于成功了。焊出来的活计，质量合乎标准，焊麻铁尤为合适。在研究过程中和试验的时候，都是由车架场电焊工杜连有给试验。他热心地拿出自己的技术经验，帮助研究，对这种电焊法研究成功，起了一定的作用。
