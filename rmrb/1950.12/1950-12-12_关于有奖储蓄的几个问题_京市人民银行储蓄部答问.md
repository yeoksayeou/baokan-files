The Savings Department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank has provided the following comprehensive answers to several questions from citizens regarding prize-linked savings certificates:

    Q: What is meant by "fourth prize, last three digits match" and "final prize, last two digits match"? How exactly do they have to match to win?

    A: The fourth prize number only draws three digits. Any savings certificate whose number has the exact same last three digits as these three digits wins the fourth prize. For example, if the drawn fourth prize number is "479," and your savings certificate number is "096479," then you win the fourth prize. The principle is the same for the final prize, last two digits matching.

    Q: Regarding the two adjacent numbers for the first prize as bonus prizes, if the drawn first prize number is "000001" or "100000," are there only one bonus prize in each case?

    A: If the drawn first prize number is "000001," the bonus prizes are "000002" and "100000." If the first prize number is "100000," then its adjacent numbers are "099999" and "000001."

    Q: Can those who win the first, second, or third prize and the bonus prize also win the fourth or final prize money? Can those who win the fourth prize also win the final prize money?

    A: If the savings certificate number that wins the first, second, or third prize is the same as the drawn fourth or final prize number, then it can also win the fourth or final prize. For example, if the first prize number is "003428," and the drawn fourth prize number happens to be "428," then this savings certificate wins the first prize and can also win the fourth prize. The same principle applies to the fourth prize also winning the final prize. To be clearer, those who win the first, second, third, or bonus prize and also win the fourth or final prize can claim both prizes. Those who win the fourth prize and also win the final prize can claim both prizes.

    关于有奖储蓄的几个问题
    京市人民银行储蓄部答问
    人民银行北京分行储蓄部对市民询问关于有奖储蓄存单的几个问题，现综合解答如下：
    问：所谓四奖末尾三字相同，末奖末尾二字相同，作何解释，怎样相同才算中奖？
    答：四奖号码只摇三个字，每张存单的号码末尾三个字与这三个字完全相同者，为中四奖。例如：摇出的四奖号码是“四七九”号，你的存单号码是“○九六四七九”号，即中四奖。末奖末尾二字相同，道理也如此。
    问：附奖两个为头奖号码的上下联号，如果摇出头奖的号码是“○○○○○一”号，或是“一○○○○○”号，那么这两个头奖的联号是否仅为一个？
    答：如果摇出头奖的号码是“○○○○○一”号，附奖即是“○○○○○二”和“一○○○○○”号。如果头奖的号码是“一○○○○○”号，那么他的上下联号即是“○九九九九九”号和“○○○○○一”号。
    问：是否凡中头、贰、叁奖及附奖者均可兼得四奖或末奖奖金，中四奖者均可兼得末奖奖金？
    答：凡中头、贰、叁奖的存单号码与摇出之四奖或末奖号码相同者，即可兼得四奖或末奖。例如中头奖的号码为“○○三四二八”号，摇出之四奖号码适为“四二八”号，那么这张存单即得头奖，也可兼得四奖。四奖兼得末奖也是这个道理。再明确些说，就是凡中头、贰、叁及附奖者如兼中四奖或末奖得兼领奖金。凡中四奖而兼中末奖者得兼领奖金。
