Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. Xinhua News Agency correspondent Wang Jianhua, who is with the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, sent the following dispatch entitled "Battle Stories from the North Korean Battlefield": In the war in North Korea, our brave Chinese People's Volunteers demonstrated amazing courage, overcoming all kinds of difficulties and launching fierce counterattacks against the American invading forces and the Li Seung-man bandit army. The offensive was like a storm sweeping away leaves, making the enemy terrified and forcing them to retreat their front line to the south of the Qingchuan River.

Here I write down a few stories of our volunteer soldiers bravely killing the enemy on the battlefield.

I. "Two Devils are Not Enough for Me to Fight Alone"

At two o'clock on the night of November 1st, on the highway in Hagiudong, Unsan area: the enemy's cars were piled up. The warriors of the Fifth and Seventh Squads of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers had crossed the highway and rushed shoulder to shoulder to the enemy's artillery positions.

Short Ninth Squad Leader Su Chongqiao, carrying young comrade Peng Jigui, closely followed behind the Fifth and Seventh Squads and rushed to the highway. The gunfire suddenly became louder, and an American soldier was squatting in the fortifications beside the highway, suffering from "startle disease." Squad Leader Su fired a shot at this "startle disease" patient, sending him rolling and crawling to the other side of the highway.

As Squad Leader Su moved forward, he discovered two more American soldiers. He pointed his gun at them, and both American soldiers threw their carbines on the ground. One sat there leaning against a tree. The other, a tall and fat fellow, suddenly stood up. Squad Leader Su immediately opened fire on him, but unfortunately, his submachine gun jammed and wouldn't fire. The fellow took advantage of this opportunity and pounced on him, pinning Squad Leader Su to the ground.

Little Peng darted over and saw a devil. He immediately drew a hand grenade, opened the cover, pulled the pin, and hooked the copper ring on his finger, intending to throw it. But looking down, he saw his squad leader pinned underneath this fellow. He thought: if I throw it, wouldn't the squad leader be killed too? So, he quickly pushed the pin back into the hand grenade, closed the cover, held his automatic rifle in his right hand, raised the hand grenade in his left hand, ran up, and smashed it hard on the fellow's head, breaking the hand grenade handle. The fellow immediately fainted. At this time, the devil who had been sitting under the tree had also stood up, holding a carbine ready to fire. Little Peng jumped forward, raised his automatic rifle, and fired twice at his head, knocking him down. Squad Leader Su also rolled over, got up, picked up the devil's carbine, and fired two shots into his chest - a gift for the stubborn resister. Then came an order to seize the hilltop, and the two warriors rushed towards the hilltop again.

On the way, Little Peng ran and laughed to his squad leader, saying, "Two devils are not enough for me to fight alone."

II. Unconquerable, but Defendable

Before dawn, the warriors of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers engaged in another fierce battle with the superior enemy in Pyeongdong.

Although the troops had been marching for more than ten consecutive days since leaving the country, fighting for seven or eight days, and endured unimaginable hardships, and in the last three days of battle, they had bathed in snow all night and waded across rivers twice, everyone was extremely tired. But no difficulty could intimidate our brave and tenacious warriors. As soon as the gunfire sounded, the warriors pounced on the hilltop like tigers.

Huang Lingqing, the Second Platoon Leader of the Ninth Company, was ordered to lead the Fourth and Fifth Squads to seize the hilltop in front of them. Our heavy machine guns and 60 mortars provided cover on the mountain. The enemy's machine guns and carbines also fired fiercely. Before reaching the halfway point, many comrades from our two squads had already been wounded or killed. Chen Yixin, the combat team leader of the Fourth Squad, charged ahead alone. He discovered that the First Squad was also pinned down by the enemy's fire halfway up the mountain. He encouraged the First Squad to charge forward and forcefully borrowed a hand grenade from the First Squad. He ran to the bottom of a steep cliff, holding his submachine gun in his left hand and raising the hand grenade in his right hand, preparing to throw it at the enemy. The two American devils on the hilltop, seeing that the situation was not good, dropped two light machine guns and ran away. The rest of the enemies also followed suit and fled. Chen Yixin leaped up the steep cliff and was the first to occupy the summit, followed by other comrades who rushed up. From the foot of the mountain to the summit, the Ninth Company only took more than twenty minutes. On this hilltop, the corpses of American invading soldiers were left behind, seventeen or eighteen of them.

In an instant, the enemy's artillery shells roared and exploded, and more than a dozen enemy planes took turns flying low to strafe and bomb, turning the battlefield into a sea of fire. The warriors were running out of ammunition, so they scrambled to pick up the guns, bullets, hand grenades of their wounded comrades, and the weapons left behind by the enemy. They also picked up some stones and piled them beside them, ready to fight the enemy to the death when they charged up.

At this critical moment, Li Decai, the Squad Leader of the Third Squad of the Artillery Platoon, said to his comrades: "Comrades: No matter how the enemy's artillery fires or the planes bomb, we must resolutely fight the enemy to the end and avenge the company commander and instructor." Liu Hongsheng added: "This time's casualties are of great value. We have stopped the enemy's attack, and the American invaders have had a tough time." Li Zaichun also said: "It is an honor to shed blood and sacrifice oneself to defend the motherland. This is the time to earn merit." The warriors encouraged each other in this way and resolutely fought.

The Tenth Company held the hilltop to the left front of the Ninth Company and repelled four enemy offensives led by tanks in one day, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, forcing the enemy to use tanks to go to the hillside to rescue his wounded, drag them down the hillside, and then use cars to pull them away. The warriors seized this opportunity to launch a fire attack on the enemy, causing the enemy to flee in panic. The warriors always firmly defended their positions.

III. "Long Live the Communist Army"

On October 29th, a unit of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteers launched an attack on the enemy Li Seung-man's Sixth Division in the Guitou Dong area of Unsan, and successfully resolved the battle that night, capturing more than sixty cars alone.

However, the defeated enemy scattered and hid in the mountains. The mountains were high, the forests were dense, and the language was unintelligible, making it difficult to capture them.

The next day at dawn, our army launched a search of the mountains. The Fifth Company of the regiment surrounded a mountain gully, moved light and heavy weapons to the two hillsides, and fiercely strafed the scattered soldiers, pressing the enemy into the gully. Combat team leader Gong Shaozhi led two team members to search along the mouth of the gully. They encountered dozens of enemies face-to-face, peering out and trying to escape from the mouth of the gully. He immediately threw a hand grenade, and an enemy fell to the ground in response. Many enemies inside, frightened, shouted in unison: "Long live the Communist Army!" But they were slow to surrender.

At this time, we captured an enemy battalion commander at the mouth of the gully. The fellow was trembling with fear and hurriedly presented two pocket watches and a wad of banknotes to instructor Liang Yanyou, begging for mercy in broken Chinese. Instructor Liang immediately returned the watches and banknotes to him, saying: "We are the Chinese People's Volunteers. We treat prisoners kindly. As long as you surrender your weapons, you will not be killed. We only want your weapons, not your private property, and we will not insult your personality." Then he ordered him to quickly go to the mouth of the gully to greet the scattered soldiers to surrender. He was very moved, looked at instructor Liang with surprised eyes, ran to the mouth of the gully, stood on a high place and shouted in Korean: "Brothers, hurry up and surrender your weapons, this is the Chinese People's Volunteers; Surrender and you won't be killed! Not only will they not kill prisoners, but I gave them my watches and banknotes, and they didn't want them. Hurry up and surrender your weapons!" More than seventy Li Seung-man bandits who were surrounded in the mountain gully obediently laid down their weapons.

As the warriors escorted this group of prisoners back, several enemy soldiers who knew Chinese kept asking: "Are you really not going to kill us?" The comrades kindly replied to him: "We don't kill prisoners. You were deceived and oppressed by American imperialism and Li Seung-man before coming to fight. If you understand the truth in the future, you will no longer sell your lives for them to fight your own brothers." These few words were quickly transmitted by them to the prisoners who did not understand Chinese.

IV. "I Won't Go Back to China for Surgery"

Li Hongsheng, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, was wounded in six places on November 6th in the battle of Pyeongdong, including his left eye, behind his right ear, and both hands. The regimental medical team sent him to the division's sanatorium for treatment.

In less than a week, Li Hongsheng became impatient. He repeatedly ran to the doctor and asked to return to the team. The doctor saw that his wound had not healed and did not allow him to leave the hospital. He kindly said to him: "Don't worry, the piece of shrapnel behind your ear and in your head has not been taken out yet. It hurts so much that you faint when you touch it. If it becomes infected with pus, it will be even harder to treat. We should send you back to China for surgery to remove this piece of shrapnel before you return to the team." He was so anxious when he heard this that he hurriedly said: "Surgery will make me recover slower and I won't be able to participate in the battle immediately. I am very afraid of being separated from the battle. I won't go back to China for surgery." The division's sanatorium could not keep him, so they had to send him back to the regiment.

Li Hongsheng returned to the regiment, and the regimental leaders wanted to keep him to rest for a few more days, but he refused. As soon as he returned to the troops, everyone enthusiastically surrounded him, looking at his wounds, asking questions, and saying: "You should have rested a few more days before coming back!" He said: "Our company suffered relatively heavy casualties in this battle, and I can't feel at ease if I rest any longer. I want to come back quickly to avenge the company commander, instructor, and comrades."

After Deputy Instructor Su Lianfu heard him talk about his request to leave the hospital, he smiled and said to him: "Isn't it better for you to rest for a few more days? Why are you so anxious to return to the team?" He said: "Since I came to Korea, I see that Korea is small, the mountains are big, and it is not rich. I know that American imperialism would never fight this war just for Korea. It is clearly to invade our China. Fortunately, we came, if we came a step later, the American devils would have fought to the Yalu River, and if they had pointed their guns at our China, wouldn't it be the same as in Korea, killing people everywhere and burning down villages? Then our China would be miserable. My eyes are still blurry, but I will still fight to the death with one eye to defend our motherland."

A comrade who came to the Ninth Company to inspect the work interjected: "Judging from your accent, you seem to be from the Northeast!" Comrade Li Hongsheng said: "You guessed right, I am from the Northeast. I worked for the landlord for seven years when I was a child. After the land reform, I was allocated a house, and I was also allocated four hectares of land, two horses, and an ox. Now my family is living a good life. I volunteered to come to Korea to fight the Americans and help the Korean people seek liberation, which is also to defend my hometown and defend the fruits of our victory."

    朝北战场上的战斗故事
    新华社记者  王健华
    【新华社二日讯】本社随中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队记者王健华，发来题为“朝北战场上的战斗故事”的通讯如下：在朝鲜北部的战争中，我英勇的中国人民志愿部队表现了惊人的勇敢，他们克服了种种困难，向美国侵略军和李承晚匪军，进行勇猛的反击。攻势犹如风扫落叶，使敌人闻风胆丧，逼得他们不得不将战线撤到清川江以南去。
    在这里我写下在战场上我志愿部队几个英勇杀敌的故事。
    一、“两个鬼子还不够我一个人打的”
    十一月一号夜里两点钟，在云山地区下久洞的公路上：堆满了敌人的汽车。中国人民志愿部队某部八连五班和七班的勇士们，已经跨过这条公路并肩冲到敌人的炮兵阵地上去了。
    矮个子九班长苏重桥，带着小同志彭吉贵，紧跟在五班和七班的后头冲到公路上来。枪声愣的更大了，一个美国兵正蹲在公路边的工事里发响。他患了“吃惊病”。苏班长照着这个吃惊病患者乓的一枪，就打得他连滚带爬的滚到公路那边去了。
    苏班长再往前走，又发现了两个美国兵。他拿枪一指，那两个美国兵便都把卡宾枪扔在地下了。一个坐在那里依着树。另一个又高又胖的家伙，霍地站了起来。苏班长立即向他开火，不巧冲锋枪卡了壳，打不响了。那家伙趁此机会扑了过来，把苏班长压在地上。
    小彭窜过来看到一个鬼子，立即抽出手榴弹，打开盖，抽出线，把铜环扣在手指上，就想扔出去。低头一看，他的班长被这家伙压在底下。他想：如果扔出去，班长岂不也被打死么？他就连忙把线环再塞进手榴弹里，盖好盖子，右手握着自动步枪，左手举起手榴弹，跑了上去，照着那家伙的头狠狠地就是一下，把手榴弹柄都打断了，打的那家伙立刻昏了过去。这时刚才坐在树下的那个鬼子，也已经站立起来，端着卡宾枪准备开火。小彭一个箭步跳了上去，举起自动步枪，对准他的脑袋砰、砰两下，就把他打倒了。苏班长也翻身爬起来拣起鬼子的卡宾枪，对准他的心口打了两枪，这是送给顽抗者的礼物。这时又来命令，去抢山头，两个勇士便又冲向山头去了。
    在路上小彭一面跑着一面笑着对班长说：“两个鬼子不够我一个打的。”
    二、攻不下，守的住
    拂晓前中国人民志愿部队某部三营的勇士，在坪洞与优势的敌人又打响了。
    虽然部队自出国以后，一连就是十几天行军，七、八天的战斗，经受了难以想像的艰苦，在最后的三天战斗中，浴了一夜雪，?了两次河，大家困得厉害，但是任何困难是吓不倒我们英勇顽强的勇士的，枪声一响勇士们就像猛虎一样直扑山头。
    九连二排长黄令清同志奉命带四班和五班抢占面前的山头。我们的重机枪，六○炮在山上掩护。敌人的机枪、卡宾枪也猛射过来。还没攻到山腰，我们两个班的同志已经伤亡了不少。四班战斗组长陈义新同志，一个人冲在最前面，发觉一班也被敌人火力压在山腰，他就鼓动一班猛冲，并在一班硬要了一个手榴弹，跑到一个陡崖下面，左手拿着冲锋机，右手举起手榴弹，对准敌人就要抛出去。山头上的两个美国鬼子见势不妙，丢下两挺轻机就逃跑了。其余的敌人也都跟着逃窜。陈义新奋身一跃跨上陡崖，首先占领山顶，接着别的同志也冲了上来。从山脚到山顶，九连只用了二十多分钟。在这个山头上，美国侵略军的尸体，遗留下十七、八具。
    顷刻天唐圆敌人的排炮轰隆轰隆地打过来，十几架敌机轮番低飞扫射轰炸，战场上变成了一片火海。勇士们的弹药快要打光了，就抢着拾起伤了的同志们的枪支、子弹、手榴弹和敌人遗下的武器，还拾了一些石头堆在手边，准备敌人冲上来时和他拚命。
    在这危急的时候，炮排三班班长李德才同志，对班里同志说：“同志们：不管敌人的炮火怎么打，飞机怎么炸，我们要坚决和敌人拚到底，给连长指导员报仇。”刘红声接着说：“这次伤亡有很大的价值，顶住了敌人的进攻，美国侵略者也够呛了。”李在春也说：“保卫祖国流血牺牲是光荣的，这正是立功的时候到了。”勇士们就是这样的互相鼓励，坚决作战的。
    十连守住了九连左前方的山头，一天打退了敌人坦克为先导的四次冲锋，给敌人以很大的杀伤，迫使敌人用坦克到山坡上去抢救他的伤号，拖下山坡去再用汽车拉走。勇士就抓住这个时机，对敌人展开火力攻击，打得敌人抱头鼠窜。勇士们始终坚守自己的阵地。
    三、“共产军万岁”
    十月二十九日，中国人民志愿部队某团之一部，在云山地区向龟头洞之敌李承晚军第六师发起攻击，当夜胜利解决战斗，光汽车就缴了六十多辆。
    但是溃敌四散藏入乱山之中，山高林密，语言不通，难以捕捉。
    次日拂晓，我军发起搜山。该团五连把一个山沟团团围住，把轻重火器运动到两面山头上，向着那些散兵猛烈扫射，把敌人压到沟里边去了。战斗组长龚绍只同志带领着两个组员，顺着沟口往里搜索，迎面发现几十个敌人，探头探脑地正在企图从沟口向外逃窜，他立即扔出一个手榴弹，一个敌人应声而倒，里面许多敌人，吓得一齐高喊：“共产军万岁！”可就是迟迟地不肯缴枪。
    这时在沟口上，我们捉住敌人的一个营长，那家伙吓得哆哆嗦嗦地连忙把两只怀表一把钞票，奉到指导员梁延友同志的手里，说着不生不熟的中国话，请求饶命。梁指导员马上把表和钞票还给他说：“我们是中国人民志愿部队，我们宽待俘虏，只要缴了枪就不杀害，我们只要你们的武器，不要你们私人的财物，也不侮辱你们的人格。”接着命令他赶快到沟口上去招呼散兵投降。他被感动得很，用惊奇的眼光看了看梁指导员，就跑到沟口站在高处用朝鲜话高喊起来：“兄弟们赶快缴枪吧，这是中国人民志愿部队；缴枪不杀啊！不但不杀俘虏，我把表和钞票送给他们，也不要我的，赶快缴枪吧！”被围在山沟里的七十多个李承晚匪军，就都乖乖地放下了武器。
    当着勇士们押着这群俘虏，往回里走时，几个会中国话的敌兵，还不断地发问：“你们到底是不是不杀？”同志们和蔼地回答他：“我们是不杀俘虏的，你们受了美帝国主义和李承晚的欺骗压迫，才来打仗，以后懂得道理了，就不再替他们卖命打自己的兄弟了。”这几句话，很快地就被他们传给那些不懂中国话的俘虏了。
    四、“叫我回国开刀我可不干”
    中国人民志愿部队某部九连四班副班长李洪生同志，在十一月六号，坪洞战斗中，左眼、右耳后、两只手共负伤六处。团卫生队把他送到师的休养所去治疗。
    不到一个礼拜，李洪生就沉不住气了，他一再跑到医生那里，要求归队。医生见他的伤口没有好，不允许他出院。好好地对他说：“你别着急，你耳朵后面头部的这块炮弹皮还没有取出来，一碰着就痛得昏过去，如果化了脓更不好治，还是送你回国去开刀，取出这块炮弹皮来，再归队吧。”他听了着急得什么似的连忙说：“一开刀就好的慢，不能马上参加战斗了，我很怕脱离战斗，叫我回国开刀我可不干。”师的休养所留不住他，只好送他回团。
    李洪生回到团里，团首长要留他再休养几天，但都被他拒绝了，他一回到部队里，大家都很热情地围住了他，看看他的伤口，问长问短，都说：“你该多休养几天再回来啊！”他说：“这次战斗咱连伤亡比较大，我再休养心里过不去，赶快回来好给连长指导员和同志们报仇。”
    副指导员苏连富同志，听他谈了要求出院的情形以后，笑着向他道：“你多休养几天不好吗？怎么这样急着归队呢？”他说：“我自从来到朝鲜以后，看他朝鲜国又小，山又大，并不富。就知道美帝国主义，光为朝鲜决不打这个仗，他明明是为了侵略咱中国。幸亏咱们来了，若晚来一步，美国鬼子打到鸭绿江边，把炮一支打到咱中国去，还不是和在朝鲜一样，到处杀人，一烧一个庄子么。那时咱中国可就苦了。我这眼睛看东西还是模模糊糊的，我一只眼睛也要拚命保卫咱们的祖国。”
    旁边一个来九连检查工作的同志插嘴道：“听你的口音像是东北人吧！”李洪生同志说：“你猜对了，我是东北人。我小时候给地主干了七年活，土改后分得了房子，又分得了四垧地、两匹马、一头牛、现在家里过的满好的，我志愿来朝鲜打美国，帮助朝鲜人民求解放，也就是为了保卫自己的家乡，保卫我们得到的胜利果实。”
