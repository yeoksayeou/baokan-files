Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is using "Development Corps" as a cover to build up new Japanese aggressive armed forces. According to a United Press report: Responsible officials from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government, as well as representatives from eight puppet agricultural organizations such as the "Developers League" and the "Rural Youth League," held a "Rural Youth Countermeasures Conference" in Tokyo on November 8th. The meeting resolved to organize so-called "Pioneer Industrial Youth Corps" as soon as possible, directly under the Minister of State, with 200,000 members, recruiting rural youth. Sakata Dōta (a member of the House of Representatives) of the Liberal Party's Policy Research Council openly stated at the meeting that "in the event of an emergency," the "Pioneer Industrial Youth Corps" would "operate as a national defense force." Before the meeting, Heroo Shuto, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board of the Yoshida government, claimed that he "very much approved" of the organization becoming a "National Security Force." As is well known, after Japan's surrender, under the cover and connivance of the American occupiers, a large number of Japanese fascist soldiers were lurking in the so-called "Development Groups" of a military nature. The Yoshida government's conspiracy to organize the "Pioneer Industrial Youth Corps" this time will allow these fascist remnants to openly engage in activities again and become tools for the United States to expand its war of aggression.

    美帝武装日本的新阴谋
    在“开拓队”的掩护下增建侵略军
    【新华社九日讯】在美帝国主义的指使下，日本吉田反动政府正以“开拓队”为外衣，增建日本新的侵略武装部队。据联合通讯社讯：吉田政府文部省（即教育部）、农林省的负责官员，以及“开拓者联盟”、“农村青年联盟”等八个御用农业团体的代表，于十一月八日在东京举行“农村青年对策协议会”。会上决议尽快组织所谓“开拓产业青年队”，由国务大臣直辖，队员二十万名，招募农村青年充当。自由党政务调查会的坂田道太（众议员）在会上公然表示：“一旦有事时”，将“开拓产业青年队”“作为国防军而活动”。吉田政府经济安定本部长官周东英雄在会前声称：他“非常赞成”该组织成为一支“国土保安队”。如所周知，日本投降后，在美国占领者的包庇纵容下，大批日本法西斯军人曾潜伏在军事性质的所谓“开拓团”内。吉田政府这次阴谋组织“开拓产业青年队”，将使这批法西斯余孽重新公开活动，充当美国扩大侵略战争的工具。
