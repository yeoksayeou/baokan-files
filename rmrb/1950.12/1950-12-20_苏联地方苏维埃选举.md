    Soviet Local Soviet Elections
    Li He
    The elections for the Soviet local Soviets were originally scheduled to be held every two years. The previous one was held from December 1947 to January 1948. Because the elections for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were held in March this year, the local Soviet elections were postponed to December 17. The Soviet people regard the election as a major national event, and they have launched a political and production upsurge to welcome the election.
    What is a Local Soviet
    Local Soviets are local organs of state power in the Soviet Union. From frontier regions to states, districts, cities, townships, and villages, all levels of administrative regions have Soviets of Working People's Deputies. They rely on the broad masses of the people to carry out their activities. They mobilize and organize the local working people to solve current national tasks and to realize national policies.
    The leading principle of the Soviet state power organs is democratic centralism. This principle enables centralized leadership and top-down planning to be combined with the creativity and initiative of the broad masses. The Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union and the various Union Republics not only supervise the activities of the local Soviets, but also lead their activities. At the same time, the local Soviets are organs elected by the working people of a certain region, and they are responsible to the local residents, maintain close contact with them, listen to their opinions, and meet their requirements.
    The local Soviet is the fully empowered organ of state power at the local level. It leads local economic and cultural construction, stipulates the local financial budget, maintains local public security, helps consolidate national defense, and protects the rights of citizens. The local Soviets play a major role in increasing industrial production, consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, and raising the material and cultural living standards of the working people. During the Great Patriotic War, the local Soviets did a lot of work in mobilizing military service, organizing universal military training, national defense construction, supplying the army, protecting the rear, establishing guerrilla teams, and caring for military families and disabled soldiers. After the war, the local Soviets actively participated in the work of restoring and developing the national economy and culture.
    Local Soviet representatives hold regular meetings to solve urgent problems of economic and cultural construction, mainly the work of local industry, urban and rural construction, housing construction, cultural and educational institutions, and shops.
    The local Soviet elects an executive organ - the Executive Committee (with a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, and members). The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing the decisions of the local Soviet meeting and the higher-level Soviet, and for leading the local political, cultural, and economic construction. The local Soviets (except for village Soviets) have several departments, such as the Trade Department, Public Utilities Department, Cultural and Educational Work Department, Finance Department, National Education Department, Social Insurance Department, Health Department, Planning Commission, Housing Construction Management Office, and so on. In order to maintain close contact with the residents, the local Soviets also elect various standing committees, such as the Trade Committee, Health Committee, National Education Committee, Public Utilities Committee, Local Industry Committee, and so on. These standing committees prepare materials and put forward opinions on the issues that the Executive Committee prepares to submit to the Soviet meeting for deliberation. These standing committees also check the work of relevant agencies and help promote the resolutions of the local Soviets.
    In this way, the local Soviets are linked to the masses, extensively absorbing them to jointly realize the functions of state power.
    Who can be a Local Soviet Representative
    The local Soviet election campaign is a large-scale movement. The Russian Federal Republic alone will elect nearly 800,000 representatives to local Soviets at all levels. The voters are strict in their choice of representatives. Only those who possess the noble qualities of Soviet people in the Stalin era are nominated as candidate representatives. These people are excellent workers who have shown unlimited love for the motherland, unlimited loyalty to the cause of building a communist society, and unlimited creativity in glorious labor. These people are the creators and true heroes of the new society.
    Many local working people nominated Stalin as the first candidate representative for the local Soviet. This demonstrates the Soviet people's unanimous support for Stalin, for the Bolshevik Party, and for its policies. This also shows the Soviet people's requirements for their representatives, requiring them to learn from Stalin's example.
    Let us introduce a few brief biographies of candidate representatives.
    Shamsonov: Is a candidate representative of the Stalingrad Oblast Soviet, a worker at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. He completed thirteen years of production quotas in the last four years. But he believes that this is not enough, and that everyone must become a Stakhanov worker. Therefore, at his initiative, six hundred Stakhanov workers passed on their advanced experience to ordinary workers. Shamsonov worked as a blacksmith in a railway repair shop when he was fifteen years old. During the first five-year plan period, he transferred to the newly established Stalingrad Tractor Factory to work, while studying at a night workers' university. In 1941, he joined the army to fight the fascist bandits, was seriously injured, and returned to the battlefield after being cured. He served as an officer in a mortar team. When he returned to Stalingrad and saw the tractor factory that had almost become a ruin, he gave up his vacation and worked hard, doing three or four days of work in one day. He is most able to help his comrades, and this help comes from a high degree of political consciousness. When worker delegations from China, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and France visited the factory, they paid close attention to his work. Once, he said to the French representatives: In the era of Tsarist Russia, skilled workers hid the secrets of their production achievements for fear of unemployment. Now we have no unemployment. The Party and the government care about us very much, and we should step up production to make the motherland more prosperous.
    Anlanayeva: Is a candidate representative of the Moscow Oblast Soviet, a female worker at the New Kerebenaia Textile Factory in Noginsk City. Two-thirds of the workers in the Soviet textile industry are female workers, and many are Stakhanov workers. Anlanayeva is one of them. Anlanayeva graduated from the factory's affiliated technical school at the age of seventeen and went to work in the factory. She has been working for twenty years now. Ten years ago, she took care of 1,440 spindles, while the quota at the time was 960 spindles. In 1942, she initiated a movement for one person to do the work of two people, taking care of 1,920 spindles. Female workers across the country have followed her example. In 1947, due to the Soviet government's abolition of the rationing system, the Soviet people's need for textiles increased. Anlanayeva and her companions found a way to take care of 2,440 spindles. She completed the five-year plan in four years and taught her advanced experience to many young female workers. She is a representative of the Supreme Soviet, a representative of the Noginsk City Soviet, and a standing committee member of the City Party Committee. In November of this year, she attended the Second World Peace Congress.
    Sharukin: Is a candidate representative of the Moscow Oblast Soviet, a native of Pokrovsk village near Moscow. After graduating from elementary school in 1928, he became a shoemaker. When the Soviet Union began to establish collective farms, he was the first to join. He led a production team in 1936. In 1941, when he was working hard to increase yields, the war began, so he went to the front. Due to heroic combat, he was wounded four times and received three highest awards. After the war, he returned to the collective farm. In 1947, he and his production team planted 12.2 hectares of land and harvested 30.37 centners of wheat per hectare (equivalent to 405 jin per mu), and was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.
    Molchanova: Is a candidate representative of the Moscow Oblast Soviet, a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, and the director of the Food Research Institute. In 1922, she began her research work. She and the staff she led have studied the metabolism of the following people: pilots in flight, workers working in hot workshops, residents of subtropical regions, mountain people, intellectual workers, college students, middle and primary school students, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and so on, and have made great contributions. She has written more than one hundred kinds of scientific works. She is also an enthusiastic disseminator of scientific knowledge, and often gives speeches to workers in public canteens, teachers, and housewives. She has been awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. She was elected as a representative of the Moscow Oblast Soviet three years ago. …
    Such excellent representatives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals are what the Soviet people want to elect.
    Stalin's Party and Non-Party Electoral Alliance
    The electoral alliance of the Party and non-Party members - that is to say, the All-Union Communist Party is not nominating candidate representatives alone, but together with non-Party members. Among the candidate representatives are Party members and non-Party members. This movement to nominate candidate representatives once again demonstrates the spiritual unity of the Soviet people and their trust in the Bolshevik Party.
    The idea of ​​the Communist Party and non-Party alliance was put forward by the Bolshevik Party on the suggestion of Comrade Stalin during the 1937 election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. At that time, the Soviet Union had achieved great economic and socio-political reforms, fundamentally eliminated the exploiting classes, built socialism, and Soviet society had achieved complete spiritual and political unity. This was the result of twenty years of effort by the Soviet people under the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party. The alliance of Communists and non-Party members is a reflection of these major changes. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his speech at the voters' meeting on February 9, 1946: "The Soviet social system... united non-Party members and Communist Party members into a common collective of Soviet people."
    In the last local Soviet elections, more than 98% of the voters who participated in the elections voted for the candidate representatives of the Party and non-Party alliance. In this year's elections for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 99.73% (election of the Union Council) and 99.72% (election of the Nationalities Council) of the voters who participated in the elections voted for the candidate representatives of the Party and non-Party alliance. This demonstrates that the Soviet people wholeheartedly support and agree with the policies of the All-Union Communist Party - guiding them to fight for world peace and to build a communist society in their own country. This support and agreement will be further proven in the Soviet local Soviet elections on December 17.

    苏联地方苏维埃选举
    李何
    苏联地方苏维埃的选举原定两年举行一次。前一次在一九四七年十二月到一九四八年一月举行。因为今年三月进行了苏联最高苏维埃选举，这次地方苏维埃选举便推延到十二月十七日举行。苏联人民把选举看作全国性的大事，他们为迎接选举而展开了政治和生产的热潮。
    什么是地方苏维埃
    地方苏维埃，是苏联为数极多的国家政权的地方机关。从边疆区到州、区、市、乡、村，各级行政区域都有劳动人民代表苏维埃。它们是依靠广大的人民群众来进行活动的。它们动员和组织当地劳动人民来解决当前的国家任务，来实现国家的政策。
    苏维埃政权机关的领导原则是民主集中制。这个原则使得集中的领导和自上而下的计划，能够跟广大群众的创造性与积极性结合起来。苏联和各加盟共和国的最高苏维埃，不但监督地方苏维埃的活动，而且还领导它们的活动。同时，地方苏维埃是一定地区劳动人民选出的机关，它要对当地居民负责，跟他们保持密切的联系，倾听他们的意见，满足他们的要求。
    地方苏维埃是地方上国家政权的全权机关。它领导地方的经济和文化建设，规定地方的财政预算，维持地方的治安，帮助巩固国防并保护公民的权利。地方苏维埃对于提高工业生产、在组织上和经济上巩固集体农场及提高劳动人民物质和文化水平，都起着很大的作用。在伟大的卫国战争中，地方苏维埃在动员兵役、组织普遍军事训练、国防建设、供应军队、保护后方、建立游击队、照顾军属和残废军人等工作上，曾作了许多工作。战后，地方苏维埃积极参加了恢复与发展国民经济和文化的工作。
    地方苏维埃代表定期举行会议，解决经济和文化建设的迫切问题，其中主要的是地方工业、城乡建设、房屋建筑、文化教育机关和商店的工作。
    地方苏维埃选出执行机关——执行委员会（内设主席、副主席、秘书及委员）。执行委员会负责执行地方苏维埃会议和上级苏维埃的决定，实现对本地政治、文化和经济建设的领导。地方苏维埃（村苏维埃除外）下设若干部门，如贸易部、公用事业部、文化教育工作部、财政部、国民教育部、社会保险部、保健部、计划委员会、房屋建设管理处等等。为了跟居民保持密切的联系，地方苏维埃还选出各种常设委员会，如贸易委员会、保健委员会、国民教育委员会、公用事业委员会、地方工业委员会等等。对于执行委员会准备提交苏维埃会议审议的问题，这些常设委员会要准备材料并提出意见。这些常设委员会也检查有关机关的工作，帮助推行地方苏维埃的决议。
    地方苏维埃就是这样和群众联系着，广泛地吸收他们来共同实现国家政权的功能。
    谁可以当地方苏维埃代表
    地方苏维埃选举运动是规模宏大的运动。仅俄罗斯联邦共和国就要选出近八十万的代表到各级地方苏维埃去。选民对于代表的选择是严格的。只有那些具有斯大林时代苏维埃人的高尚品质的人们，才被提名为候选代表。这些人们都是对于祖国表现了无限的热爱，对于建设共产主义社会的事业表现了无限的忠诚，对于光荣的劳动表现了无限的创造力的优秀工作者。这些人们是新社会的创造者和真正的英雄。
    许许多多地方的劳动人民提出了斯大林为当地苏维埃的第一名候选代表。这表现了苏联人民对于斯大林，对于布尔什维克党及其政策的一致拥护。这也说明了苏联人民对自己的代表的要求，要求他们学习斯大林的榜样。
    让我们介绍几个候选代表的简略生平吧。
    沙姆梭诺夫：是斯大林格勒州苏维埃候选代表，斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的工人。他在最近四年内完成了十三年的生产定额。但他认为这还不够，必须使全体成为斯塔哈诺夫工作者，于是在他的创议下，有六百个斯塔哈诺夫工作者把自己的先进经验传授给普通工人。沙姆梭诺夫十五岁时就在铁路修理厂当铁匠。第一个五年计划时期转到新成立的斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂做工，同时在夜间工人大学念书。一九四一年他从军打法西斯德寇，受了重伤，治好后重上战场。他当过迫击炮队军官，当他再回到斯大林格勒看到了几乎变成废墟的拖拉机工厂的时候，他放弃了休假，埋头苦干，一天做三四天的工。他最能帮助自己的同志，而这种帮助是出于高度的政治觉悟的。中国、捷克、罗马尼亚、法国的工人代表团访问该工厂时，都很注意他的工作。有一次他对法国代表们说：在沙俄时代，熟练工人因为怕失业而隐藏自己的生产成绩的秘诀。现在我们已经没有失业了。党和政府都很关心我们，我们应当加紧生产，使祖国更加富强。
    安兰耶娃：是莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，诺基斯克市新克列别那亚纺织厂的女工。在苏联纺织工业中有三分之二的工人是女工，有许多是斯塔哈诺夫工作者，安兰耶娃就是其中的一个。安兰耶娃十七岁从工厂附设的技术学校毕业后，就到工厂作工，到现在已经作了二十年的工。十年前，她照管一四四○个纱锭，而当时的定额是九六○个纱锭。一九四二年，她发起一个人做两个人工作的运动，照管了一九二○个纱锭。全国女工都纷纷向她学习。一九四七年，由于苏联政府取销了配给制度，苏联人民对纺织品的需要增加了。安兰耶娃和她的同伴们就设法照管二四四○个纱锭。她在四年内完成了五年计划，并把自己的先进经验教会了许多青年女工。她是最高苏维埃代表，诺基斯克市苏维埃代表和市党委的常委。今年十一月，她出席了第二届世界保卫和平大会。
    沙鲁金：是莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，莫斯科近郊波克罗夫斯克村人。一九二八年小学毕业后当鞋匠。苏联开始成立集体农场时，他就首先加入。他在一九三六年领导了一个生产队。一九四一年，当他正努力提高收获量的时候，战争开始了，于是他就到前线去。由于英勇作战，他曾受伤四次，得了三次最高的奖励。战争结束后，他回到集体农场。一九四七年，他和他的生产队种了一二·二公顷地，每公顷收了三○·三七生丁纳麦子（合每市亩收四百零五市斤），因而荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    莫尔察诺娃：是莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，苏联医药科学院通讯院士，食物研究院院长。一九二二年，她就开始研究工作。她和她所领导的工作人员研究过下列各种人的新陈代谢情况：在飞行中的飞行员、在灼热的车间中工作的工人、亚热带的居民、山民、智力劳动者、大学生、中小学生、孕妇、乳母等等，并有了很大的贡献。她写了一百种以上的科学作品。她同时又是科学知识的热心的普及者，经常给公共食堂工作者、教员、家庭妇女做演讲。她获得了列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。三年前被选为莫斯科州苏维埃代表。……
    像这样的工人、集体农民、知识分子的优秀代表，就是苏联人民所要选举的。
    斯大林党与非党选举联盟
    党和非党的选举联盟——这就是说，联共党不是单独而是跟非党员一起提出候选代表来的，候选代表中有党员也有非党员。这次联盟提出候选代表的运动，又一次表现了苏联人民的精神的一致，表现了他们对布尔什维克党的信赖。
    共产党和非党联盟的思想，是在一九三七年苏联最高苏维埃选举时，根据斯大林同志的建议由布尔什维克党提出来的。那时候苏联已经实现了经济和社会政治的巨大改革，根本消灭了剥削阶级，建设了社会主义，苏维埃社会已在精神上与政治上取得了完全一致。这是苏联人民在联共党领导之下，经过二十年的努力才达到的结果。共产党员和非党员联盟就是这些重大变革的反映。斯大林同志一九四六年二月九日在选民大会的演说中指出过：“苏维埃社会制度……把非党员和共产党员联合成为一个共同的苏维埃人集体了”。
    在上次地方苏维埃选举中，参加选举的百分之九十八以上的选民投了党和非党联盟候选代表的票。在今年苏联最高苏维埃选举中，参加选举的选民的百分之九九点七三（联盟院选举）和九九点七二（民族院选举）投了党和非党联盟候选代表的票。这表现了苏联人民全心全意拥护并赞同联共党的政策——引导他们为世界和平而斗争和在本国建设共产主义社会的政策。这种拥护和赞同，在十二月十七日的苏联地方苏维埃选举中，又将得到新的证明。
