    She County's Fifth District: Every Village Has a Winter School; Running Winter Schools Well to Improve the People's Cultural and Political Level
    Yang Yufeng
    [This Newspaper News] The reason why winter schools are universally established in the fifth district of She County is due to the importance attached by leaders and the existing foundation. Now, all nineteen administrative villages in the district have winter schools. There are a total of forty-three large winter schools for men and thirteen for women (attended by the elderly and middle-aged, studying political classes); one hundred and twelve small winter schools for men and thirty for women (attended by young people, studying literacy). Currently, the number of enrolled students is more than one thousand six hundred and ninety young men and women, and one thousand two hundred and ninety elderly and middle-aged people.
