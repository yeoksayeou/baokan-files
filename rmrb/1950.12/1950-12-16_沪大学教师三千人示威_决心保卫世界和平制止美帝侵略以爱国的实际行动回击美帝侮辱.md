Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th. Three thousand teachers from various universities in Shanghai held a rally on the 14th to resist US aggression, aid Korea, defend the country, and safeguard world peace. After the meeting, they held a demonstration.

At the beginning of the conference, Chen Wangdao, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a speech. He said: This demonstration by all teachers of Shanghai universities demonstrates the determination of Shanghai higher education workers to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and also demonstrates our close unity. The insults of the likes of Austin against the Chinese people have aroused our deeper hatred of American imperialism, and we are determined to repay the insults and aggression of American imperialism against us with various practical patriotic actions.

Professor Wu Youxun, who went abroad to participate in the 250th anniversary of the Democratic German Academy of Sciences, then reported to the conference on his experiences abroad. He described with excitement the welcome he received along the way and the love of the people of the new democratic countries for our great leader Chairman Mao and their hopes for the new China. He said: China's international status has improved, and everywhere representatives of the new China are asked to speak. Whenever the three words "Mao Zedong" are mentioned, there is lasting applause. At this time, many teachers were moved to tears, and they excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

Professor Pan Chengliang of the Department of Civil Engineering of Jiaotong University, who studied in the United States, and Chen Duan, Director of the Banking Department of Datong University, reported at the meeting that they had encouraged their beloved sons to participate in military cadre schools to defend the motherland. Professor Pan Chengliang said: The new China needs a national defense force that can master modern science and technology. Today, the people are asking my son to be a people's engineer in national defense construction. I believe this is no worse than him being a textile engineer. This is my glory and pride. Professor Chen Duan said excitedly: My son is studying in the shipbuilding department of Jiaotong University. I encourage him to participate in national defense construction. This is the duty of parents. This is the bright road for young people in the Mao Zedong era, and this is also the glorious educational achievement of the people's teachers.

Professor Pan Shizi of St. John's University denounced the situation of being ravaged by American imperialist enslavement education for about sixty or seventy years, and expressed that all teachers, students, and staff of church schools will resolutely stand on the people's side, expose Austin's shameless lies, and give the aggressors a merciless blow. At this point, the whole audience shouted angrily: "Down with American imperialism."

Finally, the conference passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to pay their respects, and passed a "Letter to Fellow University Teachers Across the Country." After the meeting, a demonstration began.

The marching team was led by Zhang Jinyi, professor of Fudan University, as the general commander, and Xiong Foxi, professor of Shanghai Drama College, Wang Xuzhuang, professor of Financial Management Department of Jiaotong University, and Xu Yisheng, professor of Statistics Department of Fudan University, as the deputy general commanders. The marching team was led by the Chinese and North Korean national flags and bands, followed by a red flag team composed of 54 professor representatives from various schools, including Fang Lingru, Zhou Gucheng, Chen Wangdao, Wu Youxun, Shen Tilan, Lü Simian, Zhou Yutong, Liao Shicheng, Li Binghuan, Wu Wenyao, Jin Tongyin, Ou Yuanhuai, and Liu Fonian, leading all the university teachers forward in the cold wind. In this majestic team, there were Xu Jinghou, a 74-year-old professor from Shanghai Municipal Industrial College with gray hair walking with a cane, and Lü Simian, a 66-year-old professor from Guanghua University; there were many professors who had studied in the United States, Christians such as Yu Rixuan, professor of Shanghai University, and Chen Renbing, professor of St. John's University; there were Catholics such as Wu Wenyao, President of Aurora University, and Professors Shen Guozuo and Yang Shida; there were Cheng Junying, professor of the Chinese Department of Great China University, Cheng Maojun, professor of Shanghai Art College, and organic chemistry expert Zhuang Changgong, who participated despite illness; and Zhao Shimin, a pharmaceutical authority who had never participated in a parade. They united and acted together under the same goal of patriotism and resistance to the United States. In the parade, there were also Soviet professor Andefu from the Shanghai Branch of the National Conservatory of Music, American professor Bai Weilian from St. John's University, German professor Qi Meiman from Tongji University, and German professor Meng Weilian, who had been driven out by Nazi Germany, who opposed American imperialist aggression and sympathized with the just struggle of the Chinese and North Korean people. They all held the banner of "Long Live the Unity of Peace-Loving People All Over the World" and participated in this demonstration.

The teachers' march was warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. Countless hands and hats waved from the building windows, trams, and cars to pay tribute to the teachers. The salute team and cheerleading team composed of more than 2,000 students from 24 schools including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, and Tongji University cheered for the teachers on both sides of the road. The 56 professors who encouraged their children to join military cadre schools were even more warmly welcomed by the masses. People rushed to shake their hands and offer flowers, and the professors were moved to tears. The professors and students of the Conservatory of Music and the citizens sang the battle song "When the motherland needs us, we will immediately pick up our guns..." When the teachers of church universities such as St. John's and Shanghai University passed by, the masses along the way immediately raised their arms and shouted: "Support the patriotic anti-American movement of church schools." The enthusiastic emotions and fighting songs shook the whole of Shanghai. The parade ended at one o'clock in the afternoon.

    沪大学教师三千人示威            
    决心保卫世界和平制止美帝侵略以爱国的实际行动回击美帝侮辱
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海市各大学教师三千人为着制止美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，于十四日举行抗美援朝保家卫国大会，会后并示威游行。
    大会开始时，首先由主席团主席陈望道致词。他说：这次上海高等学校全体教师的示威大会，表现了上海高等教育工作者抗美援朝的决心，也表现了我们紧密的团结。奥斯汀之流对中国人民的侮辱已激起我们对美帝国主义更深的仇恨，我们决以各种爱国的实际行动来回击美帝国主义对我们的侮辱及侵略。
    出国参加民主德国科学院二百五十周年纪念的吴有训教授接着向大会报告了出国经过。他以兴奋的心情描述沿途所受到的欢迎及各新民主主义国家人民对我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴和对新中国的希望。他说：中国国际地位提高了，到处要求新中国的代表讲话，一提到“毛泽东”三个字，就会掀起历久不息的掌声。这时，许多教师都高兴得流了泪，他们兴奋地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    曾留学美国的交通大学土木系教授潘承梁，大同大学银行系主任陈端在会上报告了他们为保卫祖国鼓励爱子参加军事干部学校的情形。潘承梁教授说：新中国需要一支能掌握现代科学技术的国防军，今天人民要求我的儿子去作一个国防建设上的人民工程师，我相信这不比他去做一个纺织工程师要差，这是我的光荣和骄傲。陈端教授激动地说：我的儿子在交大造船系读书，我鼓励他参加国防建设，这是做父母的应尽职责，这是毛泽东时代青年的光明大道，这也是人民教师的光荣教育成果。
    圣约翰大学潘世兹教授向大会控诉约六七十年来受美帝国主义奴化教育摧残的情形，并表示教会学校的全体师生员工将坚决站在人民立场，揭穿奥斯汀的无耻谰言，予侵略者以无情的打击。至此全场愤激地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义”。
    最后，大会通过致电毛主席及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致敬，并通过“告全国大学教师同仁书”。会后即开始游行示威。
    游行队伍由复旦大学教授章靳以任总指挥，上海戏剧专科学校教授熊佛西、交通大学财务管理系教授汪旭庄及复旦大学统计系教授许义生任副总指挥。游行队伍以中朝国旗及乐队为前导，接着是由各校教授代表方令孺、周谷城、陈望道、吴有训、沈体兰、吕思勉、周予同、廖世承、李炳焕、吴文耀、金通尹、欧元怀、刘佛年等五十四人组成的红旗队，领导着全体高等学校的教师们迎着寒风阔步前进。在这支雄壮的队伍里，有鬓发斑白拄着手杖行进的上海市立工业专科学校的七十四岁的老教授徐敬侯，光华大学六十六岁的老教授吕思勉等；有许多留美的教授，有基督教徒如沪江大学教授余日宣、圣约翰大学教授陈仁炳等；有天主教徒如震旦大学校长吴文耀、教授沈国祚、杨士达等；有扶病参加的大夏大学中文系教授程俊英、上海美术专科学校教授程懋筠及有机化学专家庄长恭等；有从未参加过游行的药学权威赵石民等。他们都在爱国抗美的同一目标下，团结并行动起来了。在游行的行列里，还有反对美帝侵略、同情中朝人民正义斗争的国立音乐院上海分院的苏籍教授安得福，圣约翰大学美籍教授白韦廉，同济大学的德籍教授戚美曼，曾被纳粹德国赶出来的德籍教授孟威廉等，他们都手举“全世界爱好和平人民团结万岁”的旗帜参加了这一示威的行列。
    教师们的游行队伍受到沿途群众的热情欢迎，街道的楼窗上、电车和汽车上无数双手和帽子挥舞着向教师们致敬。交大、复旦、同济等二十四个学校二千余学生所组成的致敬队、助威队，向老师们夹道欢呼。五十六位鼓励自己儿女参加军事干校的教授，更倍受群众的热烈欢迎，人们争着向他们握手献花，教授们被感动得流下热泪。音专的教授们、学生们和市民们更同声唱起了“当祖国需要的时候，我们马上拿起枪……”的战歌。当圣约翰、沪江等教会大学的教师们经过时，沿途的群众立即振臂高呼：“援助教会学校的抗美爱国运动”。热烈的情绪和战斗的歌声，震彻全上海。游行至下午一时始告结束。
