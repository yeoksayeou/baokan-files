    Atomic Physicist
    Professor Zhao Zhongyao Returns to Guangzhou
    Expresses Utter Indignation at Unreasonable Persecution by U.S. Imperialism
    【Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th】Professor Zhao Zhongyao, an atomic physicist, and his two students, Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong, who were unreasonably detained and persecuted by the U.S. military headquarters in Japan while transiting through Japan on their way back to China from the United States a month ago, have been freed thanks to the indignant protests of the Chinese people. They arrived back in Guangzhou on November 28th. They were warmly welcomed and offered condolences by representatives from the Cultural and Educational Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, and various cultural and educational organizations.
    Professor Zhao Zhongyao and others gave a statement regarding their persecution. When they left Los Angeles on the President Wilson on August 29th to return to China, they were subjected to a brutal search by U.S. imperialism, and all of their books, especially those related to physics, were taken away. On September 12th, when the ship passed Yokohama, Japan, MacArthur Headquarters of the U.S. military in Japan ordered personnel from the Yokohama Intelligence Department to inspect their luggage. These U.S. intelligence personnel first inspected their carry-on luggage, taking away everything they deemed important. Because the other luggage was difficult to retrieve from the bottom of the ship, the U.S. military headquarters decided to inspect it again when the ship returned to Yokohama from Hong Kong. U.S. personnel forced Professor Zhao and others to disembark, first detaining them in the U.S. military intelligence department, then transferring them to the Nakano U.S. military prison in Tokyo at midnight, and the next morning to the Sugamo prison (where Japanese war criminals were detained) in the "Chinese Prisoner Room" (which held more than 300 Chinese nationals). After being unreasonably detained for two weeks, when the Wilson returned to Yokohama, the U.S. military inspected their luggage, and because they could not find an excuse, they moved them to the Kuomintang delegation in Japan under house arrest. It was not until November 15th, under the continuous and strong protests of the Chinese people, that the U.S. imperialism was forced to release them. However, the items they had seized were refused to be returned. They expressed utter indignation at this unreasonable persecution by U.S. imperialism.

    原子物理学家
    赵忠尧教授返广州
    对美帝无理迫害表示万分愤慨
    【新华社广州二十九日电】月前离美归国旅途经日本时被美军驻日总部无理拘留和迫害的我国原子物理学家赵忠尧教授及罗时钧、沈善炯两学生，在中国人民的愤怒抗议下，已经获得自由，于十一月二十八日返抵广州。他们受到广东省人民政府文教厅、广州市人民政府文教局及各文教机关团体代表的热烈欢迎和慰问。
    赵忠尧教授等对此次被迫害经过曾发表谈话。他们在今年八月二十九日自洛杉矶乘威尔逊总统号轮船离美返国时，即遭美帝凶横地搜查，他们所有的书籍特别是有关物理学的书籍全部被拿去。九月十二日船经日本横滨时，美帝驻日麦克阿瑟总部又下令横滨情报部派员检查他们的行李。这些美国情报人员首先检查他们随身行李，把认为重要的物品全部取去。其他行李因在船底难于取出，美帝驻军总部便决定在该船由香港折返横滨时再行检查。美方人员强迫赵教授等登岸后，先把他们拘押在美军情报部，深夜十二时移至东京中野美军监狱，翌晨又转移到巢鸭监狱（这是拘留日本战犯的地方）中的“中国犯人室”（这个“中国犯人室”囚禁了三百多中国侨民）。他们被无理拘禁两周后，当威尔逊号返经横滨时，美帝驻军检查了他们的行李，因找不到借口，即将他们移至国民党驻日代表团软禁。直至十一月十五日，在中国人民不断地强烈抗议下，美帝才无可奈何地释放他们。但他们劫去的物品，则拒不发还。他们对于美帝这种无理迫害，表示万分愤慨。
