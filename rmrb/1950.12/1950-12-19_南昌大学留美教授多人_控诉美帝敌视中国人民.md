(Xinhua News Agency) Several professors at Nanchang University who had studied in the United States, including Liu Qiancai, Cai Fangyin, Xu Ming, Li Shaode, Yin Zhilan, Peng Wenhe, Huang Xueshi, and Wu Qi, who had also studied in the United States, have written articles based on their personal experiences to accuse American imperialism of its vicious acts of antagonizing the Chinese people and to reveal the reactionary and degenerate truth of American imperialism.

Professors such as Liu Qiancai unanimously accused the American government of disrespecting the personal freedom of overseas Chinese and students studying in the United States. Overseas Chinese or Chinese students in the United States must be subjected to strict inspection, obstruction, and even abuse and imprisonment by the American reactionary authorities upon landing. Professor Yin Zhirun went to the United States in the autumn of 1934 and was unreasonably detained for 24 hours before landing. Professor Xu Ming, who studied at Austin University from 1945 to 1948, was falsely accused by the American authorities of being a "neurotic" and detained in a police station and "sanatorium" for 26 days because he corresponded with General Feng Yuxiang, who was in the United States at the time.

Due to the American government's discrimination against Chinese people, many barber shops, restaurants, theaters, and dance halls do not allow Chinese people to enter. It is common to see signs openly posted in front of houses that read, "This house is not rented to Chinese people," which insults the Chinese people. In "Chinatown," where overseas Chinese in New York gather, the American government has special police officers to strictly supervise. Films monopolized by the American ruling class often contain scenes of enslaving and insulting Chinese people.

The professors pointed out that the American imperialists' discrimination against people of color shows what the American ruling class's so-called "democracy" really is. Professor Xu Ming, who studied agricultural technology in the United States, traveled extensively in the black areas of the southern United States. He said: "The housing for black people is mostly built of wood and is very simple. On buses and in train station waiting rooms, black people are assigned to the worst seats. They are often subjected to abuse and beatings by white people."

In the United States, the decadent capitalist system has created two extremes of life: on one side is the extravagance and debauchery of a few financial oligarchs; on the other side is the hunger and poverty of the vast working people. Professor Liu Qiancai wrote: "In the 'night clubs' of cities like New York, wealthy beasts even immerse naked women in pools of wine for amusement." Professor Peng Wenhe said: "American university professors are paid very little. I have personally seen two or three university teaching assistants sharing a small room. The vast unemployed masses are forced to rob and steal, and even sell themselves into prostitution." Wu Qi, who knew some low-ranking employees in the United States, said that their income was so meager that they could hardly afford the tram fare to the office every day. An American classmate of Wu Qi's was forced to give up his doctoral examination because he did not have more than 1,000 US dollars for the publication fee of his thesis. Wu Qi said: "The longer I stayed in the United States, the more the illusions I had when I went there were shattered by reality. Finally, I left the United States with contempt and disgust."

    南昌大学留美教授多人            
    控诉美帝敌视中国人民
    【新华社讯】南昌大学曾经留学美国的教授刘乾才、蔡方荫、徐明、李绍德、殷之澜、彭文和、黄学诗及曾在美国留过学的吴奇等八人，根据他们亲身的经历，著文控诉美帝国主义敌视中国人民的恶毒行为，和美国帝国主义的反动堕落的真相。
    刘乾才等教授一致控诉美国政府不尊重华侨和留美学生的人身自由。华侨或中国留美学生在美国登岸时，均须受到美国反动当局的严密检查、留难，甚至虐待和监禁。殷之润教授于一九三四年秋赴美，登陆前即曾被无理拘留了一昼夜。徐明教授自一九四五年到一九四八年在奥斯登大学读书时，因与当时在美的冯玉祥将军通讯，曾被美国当局诬为“神经病者”，拘禁于警察局和“疗养院”达二十六天。
    由于美国政府歧视中国人，不少理发室、餐馆、戏院、舞厅不准中国人进去；在房前公然张贴“此房不租给中国人”的侮辱中国人民的标语，已是司空见惯的事。在纽约华侨聚居的“唐人街”，美国政府派有特别警察严格监督。为美国统治阶级所垄断的电影，时常有奴役和侮辱中国人的镜头出现。
    教授们指出：从美帝国主义者对有色人种的歧视便可以看出美国统治阶级的所谓“民主”是什么东西了。在美学习农业技术的徐明教授，曾遍游美国南部的黑人地区。他说：黑种人的住房大都用木板盖造，十分简陋。在公共汽车里、火车站的候车室里，黑种人被指定在最坏的座位。他们并经常要受到白种人的虐待和欧打。
    在美国，腐朽的资本主义制度造成了两种生活极端：一边是少数金融寡头的骄奢荒淫；一边是广大的劳动人民的饥饿贫困。刘乾才教授写道：“在纽约等城市的‘夜晚俱乐部’里，豪富野兽们甚至把裸体女人浸在酒池里围饮取乐。”彭文和教授说：“美国大学教授待遇很低，我亲眼看见两三个大学助教只能合租一个亭子间。广大的失业群众，被迫去抢劫和偷窃，甚至出卖色情。”吴奇在美国时认识一些职位较低的职员，他说：他们的收入是如此低微，以致每天到办公室去的电车费都几乎是出不起的。吴奇的一个美国籍同学，因为没有一千多美元的论文出版费，结果被迫放弃了博士学位考试。吴奇说：“在美国愈久，去时的幻想也就愈为现实所打破。最后我带着鄙弃厌恶的心情离开了美国。”
