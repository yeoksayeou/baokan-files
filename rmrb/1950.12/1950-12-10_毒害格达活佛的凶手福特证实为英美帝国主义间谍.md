Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 8th: Robert Webster Ford, the British man captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Qamdo Campaign, has been confirmed as a spy for Anglo-American imperialism. His espionage activities reveal the aggressive ambitions of American and British imperialism towards China's Tibet. Ford, 27, was the director of the British "Qamdo Radio Station." In October 1943, he was sent to India by the British government as a radio instructor. In April 1945, he was transferred to work at the "British Radio Station" in Lhasa, Tibet. Later, he returned to India for a period of time, and in 1948 he returned to Lhasa and began to establish the Qamdo radio station. On July 20, 1949, he brought two American-made transmitters, one British-made new transceiver, and one American military radio, along with a large amount of gasoline, from Lhasa to Qamdo. He then established a radio station in Dongjiangka, east of Qamdo city, and engaged in espionage activities to collect military intelligence. Before the People's Liberation Army crossed the Jinsha River in October of this year, Ford also established a branch station at the junction of Qinghai and Xikang, collecting military intelligence and contacting the "British Radio Stations" in Lhasa, Gyantse, Shigatse, Gadak, Yatung, and other places. After being captured, he confessed that he also maintained close relationships on the radio with "friends" in the United States, Britain, and Japan. He also maintained close contact with Lowell Thomas, an American agent who once infiltrated Tibet. In addition, he frequently interacted with high-ranking Tibetan officials in Qamdo, from whom he stole intelligence and sowed discord between the Tibetan and Han peoples. Gedda, a member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, arrived in Qamdo on July 24 to advocate for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and Ford plotted to poison him. On October 19, on the eve of the liberation of Qamdo, Ford fled with the Tibetan troops under the command of Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, a high-ranking Tibetan official stationed in Qamdo, to a place eighty miles west of Qamdo city, where he was captured by the pursuing troops of the People's Liberation Army. All the radio equipment and seventy barrels of gasoline he carried were also seized. The entire espionage activities of British spy Ford in Xikang and Tibet within Chinese territory are still under investigation.

    毒害格达活佛的凶手福特证实为英美帝国主义间谍
    【新华社重庆八日电】在昌都战役中被解放军俘虏的英国人福特（Robert·Webster·Ford），已证实为英、美帝国主义的间谍。从他的间谍活动中，可以看出美、英帝国主义对我国领土西藏的侵略野心。福特是英国“驻昌都电台”台长，现年二十七岁。他在一九四三年十月被英国政府派往印度任无线电台教官，至一九四五年四月被调派西藏拉萨“英国电台”工作。此后，他曾一度回到印度，于一九四八年又回到拉萨，开始进行建立昌都电台的工作。一九四九年七月二十日，他带着美国制造的发报机两部、英国制造的新式收发报机一部和美国军用收音机一部以及大批汽油，从拉萨到了昌都，即在昌都城东江卡建立电台，从事收集军事情报的间谍活动。在本年十月人民解放军渡越金沙江以前，福特并在青海、西康交界处设立分台，收集军事情报与拉萨、江孜、日喀则、噶大克、亚东等地的“英国电台”联络。被俘后，他供认还经常与在美国、英国和日本的“朋友”们在电台上保持密切的关系。并与一度潜入西藏的美国特务鲁维尔汤姆斯（Lowell Tomas）保持密切联系。此外，他还与西藏在昌都的高级官员经常来往，从中窃取情报，并挑拨和离间藏汉人民的感情。我西南军政委员会委员格达为奔走西藏和平解放事业，于七月二十四日到达昌都后，福特即设计将他毒害。十月十九日昌都解放前夕，福特随西藏驻昌都高级官员噶伦阿培昂王吉美所属藏军逃至昌都城西八十里处，为人民解放军追击部队捕获，其携带之电台全部设备与七十桶汽油亦被全部缴获。英国间谍福特在中国领土西康、西藏境内的全部特务活动正在继续侦讯中。
