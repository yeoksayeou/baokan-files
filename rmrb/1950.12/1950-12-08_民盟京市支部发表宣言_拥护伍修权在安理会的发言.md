    The Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League Issues a Declaration
    Supporting Wu Xiuquan's Speech at the Security Council
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League issued a declaration on December 4th, supporting Wu Xiuquan's speech. The full text of the declaration is as follows:
    Our country's representative Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations Security Council, denouncing the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan, is enthusiastically supported by the 500 million Chinese people. This not only represents the Chinese people's just accusation, but also expresses the common desire of peace-loving people around the world.
    Representative Wu Xiuquan pointed out with justice and confidence: Taiwan, whether legally or factually, is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan's status has long been determined, and the United Nations has no reason to change Taiwan's status. Today's Taiwan has only one problem, and that is the problem of the US government's armed aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the US government's illegal and criminal act of aggression. Under any circumstances, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and allow the Taiwanese compatriots in deep water and scorching fire to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.
    The three proposals put forward by Representative Wu Xiuquan in his accusation not only conform to the interests of the Chinese people, but also conform to the common interests of the people all over the world. Because only by adopting these proposals can the Korean issue be resolved peacefully, the Eastern situation be fundamentally clarified, and the peace and security of the Pacific and Asia be guaranteed. Therefore, these three proposals are the only reasonable and concrete plan to strive for world peace.
    We fully support Representative Wu Xiuquan's just speech and his proposals. No matter how the US imperialists use their voting machine to illegally and unreasonably veto them, the Chinese people and the people of the world must do everything in their power to realize these three proposals and fight to the end to smash US imperialist aggression and strive for world peace.

    民盟京市支部发表宣言
    拥护伍修权在安理会的发言
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟北京市支部，于十二月四日发表宣言，拥护伍修权的发言，宣言全文如下：
    我国代表伍修权在联合国安全理事会上控诉美国武装侵略台湾的发言，是五万万中国人民所热烈拥护的。这不仅代表中国人民提出了正义的控诉，并且也代表爱好和平的世界人民表达了共同的愿望。
    伍修权代表理直气壮地指出：台湾不论在法律上和事实上，都是中国领土不可分的一部分。台湾的地位早就决定了，联合国没有任何理由可以变更台湾的地位。今天的台湾，只有一个问题，那就是美国政府武装侵略我国领土台湾的问题。中国人民对于美国政府的非法的犯罪的侵略行为，是绝对不能容忍的。在任何情况下，中国人民一定要解放台湾，使水深火热中的台湾同胞早日回到祖国的怀抱。
    伍修权代表在控诉中所提出的三项建议，不仅符合中国人民的利益，并且符合全世界人民的共同利益。因为，只有采纳了这些建议，朝鲜问题才能和平解决，东方局势才能根本澄清，太平洋与亚洲的和平与安全才能得到保证。所以，这三项建议，就是争取世界和平的唯一合理的具体方案。
    我们完全拥护伍修权代表的正义发言及其建议，不管美帝怎样利用它的表决机器来非法地无理地否决，但是中国人民和全世界人民一定要以全力，为实现这三项建议，并粉碎美帝侵略，争取世界和平而奋斗到底。
