Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th. Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, encompassing over 300 trades and 150,000 people, held a demonstration parade on December 16th to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard homes, and defend the country. The 150,000 participants collectively voiced the angry roar of "Down with American Imperialism," demonstrating that Shanghai's national industrialists and businesspeople, who have suffered from imperialist aggression and persecution for over a century, have united unprecedentedly under the great banner of anti-American patriotism.

On the morning of the 16th, more than 110,000 shops and enterprises throughout the city raised the national flag. Defying the cold wind and rain, the marching crowds converged from all corners of the city into four mighty streams of red flags, surging towards the People's Square in the city center from the four directions of central, eastern, southern, and western districts. The central route, led by the presidium of Hu Juewen, Rong Yiren, Liu Hongsheng, Wu Yun Chu, Guo Dihuo, Xiang Shuxiang, Liu Jingji, Wang Xingyao, Xi Wenguang, Kui Yanfang, Bao Dasan, Hong Nianzu, Liu Nianyi, Jing Shuping, Wang Jianshi, and others, proceeded from the Bund along Nanjing Road to the People's Square, converging with the southern, western, and eastern routes in front of the reviewing stand in the People's Square at 10:50 AM. Amidst the sound of salutes and the national anthem, a giant national flag was raised in front of the massive portrait of Chairman Mao, and hundreds of peace doves soared into the sky, demonstrating the powerful force and will of the people of Shanghai to resist aggression and strive for world peace.

Liu Hongsheng, Hu Juewen, and Rong Yiren, representing the presidium of the conference, solemnly read aloud to the entire assembly the telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the telegram of respect to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the telegram to the national industrial and commercial circles.

At 11:25 AM, the parade began. Twenty-six general detachments and one hundred and twenty-three large detachments, totaling 150,000 people, held high thousands of red flags and marched past the reviewing stand in four routes, receiving the review of the presidium composed of members of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and directors of various trade associations. When giant banners and horizontal scrolls of the Patriotic Pact to Resist America and Aid Korea passed the reviewing stand, the presidium also waved red flags in response.

After passing the reviewing stand, the four routes of marchers proceeded along East Yan'an Road, Nanjing Road, and Weihaiwei Road to conduct demonstration parades in various districts of the city. In the magnificent procession, there were industrialists operating several factories, businesspeople employing hundreds of workers, and self-employed vendors working independently, there was 68-year-old industrialist Kui Yanfang, and there was 18-year-old vendor Lu Zhihu. They all chanted in unison: "All Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles unite!" "Guarantee continued price stability, guarantee sufficient supply for military and civilian needs." The ranks of all walks of life burst forth with slogans to implement the Patriotic Pact into practical action, and held high various charts, cartoons, and flags with different contents and forms, expressing the industrial and commercial circles' hatred of American imperialism and the rising production situation after liberation. The cotton textile industry carried a large chart in front of its ranks showing the monthly increase in yarn and cloth production. The production index on the chart in the cement industry's procession showed that the industry's output in October had increased 7.5 times compared to before the bombing by American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft on February 6th. The pharmaceutical industry's cartoon depicted the painful scene of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry being squeezed out by a large number of American-made medicines before liberation, expressing the industry's infinite hatred for American imperialism. The dairy industry used two true and contrasting pictures, one depicting the killing of cows and closing of factories due to the pressure of American dairy products before liberation, and the other depicting the rapid recovery and development after liberation, to illustrate that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of China's national industrial and commercial circles. The fountain pen industry, which had been driven to a dead end by American goods before liberation, held high five giant models of gold pens, with the five pen nibs pointing at a paper tiger symbolizing American imperialism. When the demonstrating procession marched to the front of the American Consulate on the Bund, they shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism, Strive for Lasting World Peace."

Wherever the marching processions went, firecrackers were set off. Dozens of propaganda stations composed of workers, students, and other people's organizations constantly encouraged the advancing crowds in the howling north wind. The central route of the parade also received a brocade banner presented by the Shanghai Student Union, which read: "Abide by the Patriotic Pact, actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and widely launch the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard homes, and defend the country." Along the way, many citizens competed to present bouquets of flowers to the presidium as a token of respect. The final ranks of the procession did not pass the reviewing stand until 2:40 PM; the city's grand demonstration parade did not end until about 7:00 PM.

    民族工商业者空前团结坚决抗美援朝            
    沪工商界十五万人示威            
    保证继续稳定物价充分供应军需民用
    【新华社上海十七日电】上海市工商界三百多个行业十五万人于十二月十六日举行了抗美援朝保家卫国示威大游行。十五万人齐声发出了“打倒美帝国主义”的愤怒吼声，显示了百余年来身受帝国主义侵略和迫害的上海市民族工商业者已经在反美的爱国主义的大旗下空前团结起来。
    十六日清晨，全市十一万多户商店、企业，都悬起了国旗。游行队伍冒着寒风和雨雪，从全市各个角落汇成四道红旗蔽空的巨流，从中、东、南、西四面向市中心跑马厅广场涌进。中路以胡厥文、荣毅仁、刘鸿生、吴蕴初、郭棣活、项叔翔、刘靖基、王性尧、席文光、蒉延芳、包达三、洪念祖、刘念义、经叔平、王兼士等主席团为前导，自外滩沿南京路进入跑马厅，与南、西、东三路队伍于十时五十分在跑马厅广场检阅台前胜利会师。在礼炮与国歌声中，在巨大的毛主席像前，升起了巨幅国旗，数百只和平鸽凌空翱翔，显示着上海人民反抗侵略、争取世界和平的强大力量和意志。
    大会主席团刘鸿生、胡厥文、荣毅仁分别向全场庄严宣读了向毛主席致敬，向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军致敬电，以及致全国工商界的通电。
    十一时二十五分，游行开始。二十六个总队、一百二十三个大队共十五万人，高举起万千红旗，分四路通过检阅台，受上海市工商联筹备委员会常委及各同业公会主任委员等所组成的主席团的检阅。当行列中抗美援朝爱国公约的巨幅标语、横联等通过检阅台时，主席团亦挥动红旗呼应。
    四路队伍通过检阅台后即沿延安东路、南京路、威海卫路，向全市各区展开示威游行。在雄壮的队伍中，有经营数家工厂的工业家，有雇用数百职工的商业家，也有独资经营、自己劳动的摊贩们，有六十八岁的工业家蒉延芳，也有十八岁的摊贩陆志鹄，他们一致高呼：“全上海工商界团结起来！”“保证继续稳定物价，保证军需民用的充分供应”。各行各业的行列都迸发出要把爱国公约贯彻到实际行动中去的口号，都高举着各种不同内容与形式的图表、漫画、和旗帜，表示工商业界对美帝国主义的憎恨和解放后生产上升的情况。棉纺业在自己的队伍前面擎着纱布生产逐月递增的大幅图表。水泥工业行列中的图表上的生产指数显示，该业十月份比二月六日美制蒋机轰炸前已增产七点五倍。制药业的漫画上画着解放前大量的美制药品挤垮了上海制药工业的惨痛情景，表示该业对美帝的无限仇恨。乳品业以解放前被美国乳品逼得杀牛关厂和解放后的迅速恢复发展两幅真情实况的图画作对照，来说明美帝国主义是中国民族工商业界的死敌。解放前曾被美货逼得走头无路的钢笔业的行列，高举着五支巨大的金笔模型，五个笔尖对准着象征美帝国主义的一只纸老虎。示威的队伍行进至外滩前美国领事馆门前时，高呼“打倒美帝国主义，争取世界持久和平”等口号。
    各路示威队伍行进到那里，那里就燃起了鞭炮。由工人、学生及其他人民团体组成的几十个鼓动站，不断地鼓舞着在北风呼号中挺进的队伍。中路游行的队伍并接受了上海市学生联合会所赠的锦旗，锦旗上写着：“遵守爱国公约，积极支援中国人民志愿部队，广泛展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动。”沿途更有不少市民，争向主席团献上一束束鲜花致意。游行队伍中的最后序列直至下午二时四十分方通过检阅台；全市的大示威游行至下午七时许始告结束。
