Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th: The newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial commenting on Hoover's speech, entitled "The Crisis of American Policy." The article stated: U.S. President Truman's recent announcement of a "national emergency" in the United States is intended to conceal the profound crisis now facing American policy, to intimidate American public opinion, and at the same time to calm the Western European vassal states of American imperialism, who are panic-stricken by the failures of American adventures in Korea.

The speech of former U.S. President Hoover and the speech previously delivered by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy clearly prove that Truman's deception of public opinion has not succeeded. He did not achieve his goal and did not receive the effect he expected. Moreover, this proves that what the President said in his speech on December 15th—that American leaders were unanimous in their policies and that his policies had the full support of the so-called bipartisan group—was completely unfounded.

In fact, the crisis of this policy is very obvious, and representatives of the American ruling group have already begun to talk about this crisis loudly. The proof is Hoover's sharp criticism of the government's policy. Hoover is an influential leader in the Republican Party and has close ties with the American business community.

Hoover's political face is well known. This old-line enemy of peace and democracy was already hated by the people to the extreme when he actively participated in the imperialist war against the young Soviet Republic and when he participated in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution in the period after the October Revolution. He is also notorious among the American people, who call him the Hunger President. It was Hoover who ordered the shooting of American veterans in the autumn of 1932, and it was Hoover who actively opposed the United States' participation in the war against Hitler's Germany. In this speech, Hoover also took off his mask and exposed himself as an enemy of international peace and cooperation. He said: "Today, there is only one center of aggression in the world. That is the large landmass of Asia and Europe, with 800 million people under Communist control." Hoover declared that the peace-loving Communist-led countries were aggressors, not lagging behind Truman. When Truman sent American troops to fight five thousand miles away from the U.S. border, he shouted that the American homeland and cities were threatened by the Korean people. Hoover also added the label of aggression in exactly the same way to all the nations that are defending their homeland and country.

Hoover is silent about what the American aggressors are doing abroad. But the facts are against Hoover. The whole world knows that no one is threatening the United States, that American troops are fighting on foreign soil, that they are soaking the Korean land in blood, robbing and trampling on the homes and villages of the Korean people, that they have seized China's Taiwan Island, and that they have repeatedly invaded the borders of the People's Republic of China. Who does not know that the war of aggression against Korea, the aggression against the People's Republic of China, and the interference of American imperialists in the internal affairs of other countries are pursuing one goal, namely, the goal of conquering and plundering these countries?

The failure of the imperialist plan of the American ruling group—this is the reason for Hoover's vicious and hateful shouts at peace-loving countries. But Hoover's hatred does not make his attacks on the peace-loving countries led by the Communist Party convincing.

On the contrary, his forced admission that the current American policy has failed sounds completely convincing. This admission sounds convincing because Hoover is basing it on facts. This is why his admission is valuable.

Hoover said that the road the United States is now taking is a road to disaster, and he strongly urged a change in this road, because it is hopeless and will inevitably have more serious consequences than the failures suffered in the Korean adventure. Indeed, any military adventure against the camp of peace and democracy (in Hoover's words, the "Communist landmass") is really foolish.

Hoover does not hide the considerations that led him to this conclusion. He believes that it is impossible to achieve a military victory over the Soviet Union. On this point, he recalled the shameful end of Hitler and his army. In addition, he believes that no army in the world can be an enemy of the liberated Chinese people. Finally, he said: "We must recognize the fact that the atomic bomb is far from being the overwhelming weapon that it was once assumed to be."

It is not only the military plans of the American government group that lack a foundation in reality. Hoover was forced to admit that Acheson's notorious "total diplomacy" had failed. He attacked the Western European puppet states of the United States under the guise of criticizing the United Nations, these countries, despite flattering the United States within the United Nations organization, have been reluctant to send any sizable number of troops to Korea to aid the American intervention army. Hoover emphasized the differences of opinion between the United States and Britain on the China issue, and admitted that the Marshall Plan, like the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, could not prove itself to be correct. Hoover said: "Obviously, in our three years of aid, the European continent has not formed the unity and the will to gain strength necessary for the purpose of defending itself." It is not difficult to see that the "defense" Hoover is talking about actually means aggression. Because this is the "term" commonly used by imperialists.

Hoover spoke angrily about the situation in Western European countries. Despite all efforts, the United States still cannot turn Western Europe into a united military camp that obeys American instructions obediently. Hoover howled: "We cannot buy them with money. If you search through the entire history of mankind, you will not find anything comparable to the efforts and sacrifices we have made to improve their morale and promote their unity, but so far, these have all failed."

Hoover then sadly summarized: "The military adventure in Asia is doomed to failure; 'total diplomacy' has failed; neither the Marshall Plan nor the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty can prove that they are in line with the hopes we have placed on them."

Hoover's speech also included another important and valuable confession, that is, he confessed to the failure of American economic policy. The arms race, the policy of extreme expansion of military production, and its one-sided role have already caused the threat of domestic inflation. The national debt has exceeded 260 billion U.S. dollars. Hoover said, "We must increase the government's currency issuance to make up for the huge deficit." He warned that this would mean economic disaster in the long run.

Hoover, while praising Truman for rejecting the policy of cooperation between East and West, declared, "We no longer want any Tehran and Yalta-like conferences." It is worth mentioning in passing that Hoover recently suggested reorganizing the United Nations and excluding all countries belonging to the camp of peace and democracy from the United Nations. Obviously, Hoover's interest lies in war, not in peace.

The tendency of Hoover's thinking can be seen from his attitude when he is willing to use the United Nations organization for the benefit of American policy. It has been proven that if the United Nations declares the People's Republic of China an aggressor, if it refuses to accept the People's Republic of China to participate, and if it organizes an economic blockade against China, then it will satisfy Hoover.

This language is the language of aggressors and imperialists, and Hoover's plan is the plan of aggressors and imperialists. He believes that it is no longer possible for American imperialism to establish hegemony on the European and Asian continents. But he believes that it is possible and necessary to establish American hegemony in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to Hoover, the boundary of the "American Empire" should be the Atlantic Ocean, including Great Britain (the former president apparently assigned Great Britain the role of the first-line air force base of American imperialism), and the Pacific Ocean, including the Philippines, China's Taiwan Island, and Japan. Hoover disregards the fact that Great Britain and Taiwan are not part of the United States of America. He strides over foreign territories like a conqueror, completely disregarding that this policy has nothing in common with the goal of maintaining peace.

Hoover believes that rearming Japan is a matter of urgency. In order to realize this plan, he strongly advocated that the U.S. Navy and Air Force "should be armed to the teeth."

From this, one can only draw one conclusion: the former president's imperialist appetite has little difference from MacArthur's imperialist appetite.

As for Western Europe, Hoover suggested implementing a "wait-and-see" policy toward it. The so-called "wait-and-see" means to put more pressure on Marshallized countries. He further suggested using the notorious "American aid" as one of the means of exerting pressure. Only when Western Europe produces enough well-equipped combat troops that the Americans need, only then will the United States be able to "further assist" these countries.

This is Hoover's plan—a plan of aggression and war.

### 真理报社论  “美国政策的危机”

    真理报社论
    “美国政策的危机”
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：《真理报》发表社论，评论胡佛的演说，题为“美国政策的危机”。该文称：美国总统杜鲁门最近宣布美国进入“全国紧急状态”，意图借此掩饰美国政策现在遭到的深重危机，恫吓美国舆论同时并使因为美国在朝鲜的冒险遭受失败而惊慌失措的美国帝国主义的西欧附庸国镇静下来。
    美国前总统胡佛的演说以及前美国驻英国大使肯尼第前此发表的演说，清楚地证明了杜鲁门欺骗舆论没有成功。他没有达到他的目的，没有收到他所期望的效果。不仅如此，这证明总统在十二月十五日的演说里所说的美国领袖们在他们的政策上意见一致以及他的政策得到所谓两党集团的充分支持这种说法是完全没有根据的。
    事实上，这个政策的危机是很明显的，而且美国统治集团的代表已经在开始大声谈论这种危机了。其证明就是胡佛对于政府方针的尖锐的抨击。胡佛是共和党中有势力的领袖，并且和美国企业界有密切的联系。
    胡佛的政治面貌是人所共知的。这一和平与民主的老牌敌人，早在他积极参加帝国主义对年青的苏维埃共和国的战争的时候，早在他于十月革命后的时期中参加镇压匈牙利革命的时候，就已被人民痛恨到极点了。在美国人民中，他也是臭名昭彰的，美国人民称他做饥饿总统。是胡佛在一九三二年秋季下命令枪杀了美国退伍军人，是胡佛积极反对美国参加反希特勒德国的战争。胡佛在这篇演说中也揭开了自己的假面具，暴露出他是国际和平与合作的敌人。他说：“今天在世界上只有一个侵略中心。那就是共产党控制下的拥有八亿人民的亚欧两洲大块土地。”胡佛宣布爱好和平的共产党领导的国家是侵略者，并不落后于杜鲁门。杜鲁门在派遣美国部队到美国国境五千英里以外去作战时，曾大叫什么美国家园与城市受到朝鲜人民威胁的危险。胡佛也一模一样地把侵略的字样加在一切正在保卫它们家乡土地与国家的民族身上。
    胡佛对于美国侵略者正在外国做的事情默不作声。但是事实是反对胡佛的。全世界都知道：没有人威胁美国，美国军队正在外国土地上作战，他们正在把朝鲜土地浸在血泊里，抢劫并蹂躏朝鲜人民的家园与村落，他们攫夺了中国的台湾岛，他们一再侵犯中华人民共和国的边疆。谁不知道，对朝鲜的侵略战争，对中华人民共和国的侵略，以及美帝国主义者对其他国家内政的干涉，是追求一个目的，即征服并掠夺这些国家的目的呢？
    美国统治集团的帝国主义计划之失败——这就是胡佛对爱好和平的国家发出恶毒与仇恨的叫嚣的原因。但胡佛的仇恨并不能使他对于共产党领导的爱好和平国家的攻击具有说服力。
    与此相反，他被迫作出的关于目前美国政策已经失败的供认，听起来倒是完全令人信服的。这种供认之所以听起来令人信服，是因为胡佛在这里是根据事实的。这就是他的供认所以有价值的原因。
    胡佛说，美国现在所走的道路是一条招致灾难的道路，他力促改变这条道路，因为它是没有希望的，并且将难免有比在朝鲜的冒险所遭的失败更为严重的后果。的确，对和平民主阵营（用胡佛的话说，是“共产主义大块土地”）的任何军事冒险都实在是愚蠢的。
    胡佛并不掩饰使他得出这样结论的一些考虑。他认为要对苏联取得军事胜利是不可能的。在这一点上，他追述了希特勒及其军队的可耻的下场。此外，他认为世界上没有任何军队能够与解放了的中国人民对敌。最后，他说：“我们必须认清一个事实：原子弹远不像被一度假定的那样是压倒一切的武器。”
    在现实中缺乏根基的不只是美国政府集团的军事计划。胡佛被迫承认艾奇逊的臭名远扬的“总体外交”失败了。他以批评联合国为名，实际上攻击美国的西欧仆从国家，这些国家，尽管在联合国组织内谄媚美国，但在派遣任何数目像样的军队到朝鲜去援助美国干涉军这一点上却表现裹足不前。胡佛着重指出美国和英国间在中国问题上的意见分歧，而且承认：马歇尔计划正如北大西洋侵略公约一样地并不能表明它自身是正确的。胡佛说：“显然，在我们三年来的援助中，欧洲大陆并没有形成为防御它自己所必需的目的的一致和取得力量的意志。”不难识破：胡佛嘴里所说的“防御”，实际上意思就是侵略。因为这是帝国主义者惯用的“术语”。
    胡佛忿怒地谈论西欧国家的情况。尽管用尽了一切努力，美国仍然不能把西欧变成乖乖地听从美国指使的联合军事阵营。胡佛号叫说：“我们是不能用金钱收买它们的。翻遍全部人类历史，你再也找不出任何事情，足与我们为了提高它们的士气与促成它们团结而做出的努力和牺牲相比拟，但是到现在为止，这些都已失败了。”
    胡佛继而悲哀地综述称：“在亚洲的军事冒险是注定要失败的；‘总体外交’已经失败了；不论是马歇尔计划或侵略性的北大西洋公约都不能证明它们是符合于我们所寄予的希望的。”
    胡佛的演说中还包括另外一个重要的有价值的自供，就是他供认了美国经济政策的失败。军备竞赛、极度扩大军事生产的政策、及其所起的片面作用，已经引起了国内通货膨胀的威胁。国债已超过二千六百亿美元。胡佛说，“我们必须增加政府的通货发行来弥补巨额赤字。”他警告说，长此以往便意味着经济灾难。
    胡佛在赞扬杜鲁门拒绝了东西方合作政策的时候宣称，“我们不再要任何德黑兰和雅尔塔之类的会议了。”这里值得顺便一提的是，胡佛最近曾建议改组联合国，把所有属于和平和民主阵营的国家都排斥于联合国之外。很明显的，胡佛的兴趣是在于战争，并不在于和平。
    胡佛思想的倾向可以从他愿利用联合国组织为美国政策的利益服务时的态度看出来。已经证明，假若联合国宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者，假若它拒绝接受中华人民共和国参加，假若它对中国组织经济封锁的话，那末它就会使胡佛满意。
    这种语言是侵略者和帝国主义者的语言，并且胡佛的计划就是侵略者和帝国主义者的计划，他认为美国帝国主义已没有可能在欧洲和亚洲大陆上建立霸权了。但他认为建立美国在太平洋与大西洋的霸权是可能的而且必需的。按照胡佛的意思，“美利坚帝国”的边界应当一边是包括英国（这位前总统显然委派给英国以美国帝国主义第一线空军基地的角色）在内的大西洋，另一边是包括菲律宾、中国的台湾岛与日本在内的太平洋。胡佛无视英国与台湾并不是美利坚合众国的一部分这一事实，他宛如一个征服者一样昂视阔步于外国的领土之上，毫不注意这个政策与维持和平的目的全无共同之处。
    胡佛认为重新武装日本为当务之急。为了实现这种计划，他力主美国的海军与空军“应该武装到牙齿”。
    由此只能得出一个结论，前总统的帝国主义胃口与麦克阿瑟的帝国主义胃口很少有什么区别。
    至于西欧，胡佛建议对它执行“观望”政策。所谓“观望”，意思就是说对马歇尔化的国家施以更多的压力。他更建议以臭名昭彰的“美援”作为施行压力的手段之一。只有当西欧拿出美国人所需要的足够的装配优良的战斗部队的时候，只有那时，美国才能“进一步援助”这些国家。
    这就是胡佛的计划——侵略与战争的计划。
