    Discontinued Regional Stamps to be Quickly Exchanged at All Levels of Post Offices
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has recently issued a circular to post offices in all regions stating that, from now until the end of December of this year, they should exchange discontinued Renminbi-denominated stamps or overprinted/revalued Renminbi-denominated stamps that were independently printed by the North China, East China, Central and South China, Northwest China, and Southwest China Postal General Sub-bureaus and their subordinate bureaus. Those who possess such stamps can bring them to the business counters of post offices at all levels to exchange for currently valid stamps of equal value. Exchanges will not be accepted after the deadline. For specific exchange methods, please inquire directly at the post office.
