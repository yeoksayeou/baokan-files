Beijing Second Municipal People’s Congress, Fourth Session, Opens
　　Yesterday Mayor Nie, Deputy Mayor Wu, and Concurrent Bureau Chief Luo Delivered Reports

　　[Beijing Municipal News Office] The Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Fourth Session, opened at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 29th), with 308 representatives in attendance. The executive chairmen were: Liu Ren, Qian Duansheng, Yu Xinqing, Fu Huating, Chen Yuan.

　　The meeting heard Mayor Nie Rongzhen's "Report on the Current Situation," Deputy Mayor Wu Han's "Report on Unemployment Relief and the Universal Convening of District People's Congresses" (full text in today's newspaper, page 3), and Public Security Bureau Concurrent Bureau Chief Luo Ruiqing's "Report on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Sabotage Activities Over the Past Year" (full text in today's newspaper, page 3). Finally, Deputy Mayor Wu Han, on behalf of the Consultative Committee, made an explanation on the "Draft Measures for the Election of Representatives to the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress," saying: This draft measure is based on the "Organizational Regulations for Municipal People's Congresses" promulgated by the Central People's Government. Because a number of new people's organizations have been established in the city over the past year, and the existing people's organizations are now more sound than before, the main spirit of the new draft measures for the election of representatives is to have the majority of representatives generated through election conferences or representative election conferences, moving from appointment to election, thereby further improving people's democracy both in form and content.

　　Today's agenda for the congress: group discussions in the morning, and in the afternoon, the congress will discuss Mayor Nie's report on the current situation, the government work report, and the measures for the election of representatives to the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress.

    京二届四次各界代表会议开幕
    昨听取聂市长吴副市长罗兼局长的报告
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第二届第四次各界人民代表会议于昨（二十九）日下午二时开幕，出席代表三百零八人。执行主席为：刘仁、钱端升、余心清、傅华亭、陈垣。
    会议听取了聂荣臻市长“关于时局问题的报告”，吴晗副市长“关于失业救济和普遍召开区各界人民代表会议两项工作的报告”（全文见今日本报第三版），公安局罗瑞卿兼局长“关于一年来镇压反革命分子破坏活动的报告”（全文见今日本报第三版）。最后，由吴晗副市长代表协商委员会在会上作了关于“北京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表产生办法草案”的说明，他说：这个办法草案是依据中央人民政府颁布之“市各界人民代表会议组织通则”制定的，由于一年多来本市新成立了一些人民团体，原有的人民团体也比以前更为健全。因此，新的代表产生办法草案的主要精神是使大部分代表的产生方式，由选派进到通过选举大会或选举代表大会选举产生，把人民民主从形式上与内容上再提高一步。
    大会今日的议程：上午为小组讨论，下午大会讨论聂市长的时事报告、政府工作报告和京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表产生办法。
