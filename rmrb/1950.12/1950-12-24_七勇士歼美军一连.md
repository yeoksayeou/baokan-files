Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, December 23rd: Our front-line reporter in Korea reports: In a battle on the northeastern front of Korea, seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army heroes annihilated a company of US invading troops with a heavy machine gun captured from the enemy.

At midnight on November 30th, a platoon of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the northeastern Korean front, after fierce fighting, captured three important hilltops in a certain area. In order to recapture these important positions, the US invading troops gathered superior forces and launched repeated counterattacks. After repeatedly repelling the enemy's counterattacks, only seven soldiers remained in this platoon of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army: Zhang Hengtian, Song Jinrong, Zeng Shaozai, Huang Yuesan, Li Shangting, He Wu, and Yan Hekai.

In the absence of command and a lack of ammunition, the seven heroes of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army did not stop fighting for a moment. They steadfastly defended the hilltop, standing firm. They collected grenades from their sacrificed comrades and bravely attacked the enemies climbing the hilltop. After throwing out their last five grenades, they could no longer find any, but the enemy's attack continued. In this critical moment, Zhang Hengtian found a heavy machine gun discarded by the enemy in their desperate retreat. He excitedly shouted, "Let's use the enemy's gun to annihilate the enemy!" They lay prone on the snow, aimed the heavy machine gun at the enemy, and with a burst of gunfire, the American soldiers retreated in disarray.

The seven heroes took turns operating the heavy machine gun, repelling each enemy counterattack. They also found sixteen boxes of ammunition in the snow. The ample ammunition further boosted their fighting will. They skillfully used this heavy machine gun that they had never used before.

The enemy on the small hilltop to the left of this steel position saw the tracer rounds fired by this heavy machine gun and mistakenly thought it was fired by their own men, so they whistled three times to make contact. Each time, the seven heroes responded to the enemy's whistle with a burst of bullets. For a full six hours, the seven heroes annihilated a company of enemy troops. They held their ground and finally joined forces with fraternal units in victory.

    七勇士歼美军一连
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十三日电】本社朝鲜前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军的七位勇士，在朝鲜东北前线的一次战斗中，以缴自敌人的一挺重机枪，消灭了美国侵略军一个连。
    十一月三十日午夜，朝鲜东北前线我国人民志愿军某排，经过激烈战斗后，攻占了某地三个重要山头。美国侵略军为了要夺回这重要阵地，集结了优势的兵力，轮番反扑。我国人民志愿军的这一个排，多次击退敌人的反扑后，只剩下了张恒田、宋金荣、曾少才、黄岳三、李尚亭、贺武、严和开等七位战士了。
    在失去指挥和缺乏弹药的情况下，我国人民志愿军的七位勇士，没有一刻停止战斗，他们始终坚守山头，屹然不动。他们从牺牲了的战友身上搜集手榴弹，勇敢地打击向山顶上爬的敌人。他们把最后的五颗手榴弹扔出以后，再也找不到手榴弹了，而敌人的攻击还在继续着。正在这紧急关头，张恒田找到了一挺敌人在狼狈溃退时丢弃的重机枪，他兴奋地喊着：“我们就用敌人的枪来消灭敌人吧！”他们伏在雪地上，用重机枪瞄准了敌人射击，一阵枪吼，打得美国兵狼狈后退。
    七勇士轮番掌握着这挺重机枪，击退敌人的每次反扑。他们又从雪地里陆续找到十六箱子弹。充足的弹药更鼓舞了他们的战斗意志。他们熟练地使用着这挺从未使用过的重机枪。
    在这个钢铁阵地左边小山巅上的敌人看到这挺重机枪发射出的曳光弹，还以为这是他们自己的人射出来的，就吹起哨音联络了三次，七勇士每次都以一连串的子弹回答了敌人的哨音。整整六个钟头，七勇士消灭了敌人一个连的兵力。他们坚守住了自己的阵地，并且终于和兄弟部队胜利会合了。
