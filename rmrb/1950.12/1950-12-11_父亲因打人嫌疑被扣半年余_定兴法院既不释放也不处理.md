To the Editor:

I am a worker and have a problem I cannot solve. I am asking for your help.

During the wheat harvest this April, in my hometown of Wujiazhuang Village, Yangcun Town, Dingxing County, a man named Zhang Wu (25 years old) was injured in the head at night (he has now recovered). Because Zhang Wu's elder brother had previously beaten my father, they suspected my father was the culprit. At the same time, Zhang Wu owed money to a Liang from the same village due to gambling and had been dragging his feet on repayment, so suspicion also fell on the Liangs. The next day, my father and Liang were both arrested and taken to the district government (Zhang Wu's sister's husband used to be a district cadre, and Zhang Wu was very familiar with the district, so the accusation was made without going through the village government). Later, they were transferred to the county government, and half a year has passed without a verdict. My sick father, who is over fifty, is imprisoned like this.

Because of this matter, I took leave to return home twice, pleading with the County People's Court not to delay the process. The first time was in the fifth month of the lunar calendar; I didn't see the person in charge and made a wasted trip. The second time was in the ninth month of the lunar calendar; I met with Director Wang of the County People's Court. He first said, "You say your father didn't do it, but Zhang Wu says your father did it, so I can't handle it." Later, he said that it could be processed by November 15th and promised to write to me to inform me of the outcome. After I returned to Beijing, I waited until the 15th and then wrote to inquire, and now more than half a month has passed, but there is still no news.

My father is over fifty years old and in poor health. Zhang Wu was beaten at the village chief's house, a large and deep courtyard, which my father couldn't even climb into; and on the night of the incident (10 o'clock), my father was still in the field pulling wheat, which can be testified to by witnesses. Therefore, I cannot provide the twenty *shi* of wheat that Zhang Wu initially demanded for medical expenses (later reduced to ten *shi*, and then neighbors suggested two or three *shi* would be enough); because if I give it, it would be the same as admitting that my father beat him. Now Zhang Wu's injury has long healed, but my father is still imprisoned. I have nowhere to appeal this injustice, so I want to ask your newspaper to investigate the case on my behalf, coordinate with the People's Government to correct shortcomings in their work, and resolve this long-pending case.

### 父亲因打人嫌疑被扣半年余  定兴法院既不释放也不处理

    父亲因打人嫌疑被扣半年余
    定兴法院既不释放也不处理编辑同志：
    我是一个工人，有件解决不了的事情，请求你的帮助。
    今年四月割麦子时，我的老家定兴县杨村镇吴家庄有一个叫张五（现年二十五岁）的，在夜间被人打伤了头（现已痊愈）。因张五之兄原先打过我父亲，就怀疑是我父亲打的。同时张五因赌博欠本村梁某的钱拖着不给，也怀疑到姓梁的。第二天，我父亲和梁某一起被抓到区政府（张五的姐夫当过区干部，张五和区里都很熟，告的时候没通过村政权），后又转到县政府，到现在整半年还没判决。我五十多岁带病的父亲，就这么监在狱里。
    为此事，我请假回过两次家，请县人民法院不要拖延时间。第一次是旧历五月，没见到负责人，空跑一趟。第二次是旧历九月，见到了县人民法院王院长。他先说：“你说不是你父亲打的，张五说是你父亲打的，我没办法处理。”后来又说等到十一月十五日就可以处理了，并答应要来信告诉我处理结果。我回北京以后，等到十五日就又写信去问，到现在又有半月多了，仍无音信。
    我父亲已五十多岁，身体又不好。张五是在村长家里被打的，深宅大院，我父亲也爬不进去；并且出事的夜晚（十点钟），我父亲还在地里拉麦子，这全有人证。因此，张五原先提的二十石麦子养伤费（后自动减到十石后经街坊说合两三石也可以），我不能拿；因为拿了就等于承认我父亲打他。现在张五的伤早好了，我父亲还监着。这口气我无处申诉，才想请贵报代我了解案情，协同人民政府改正工作中的缺点，了结这久悬的案子。
