Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd: Pravda recently published an editorial entitled "On Truman's Statement at a Press Conference - New War Hysteria," stating: In his public official statement on the recent situation in Korea at a press conference on November 30, Truman not only reiterated the old tune that the U.S. government does not intend to abandon its "mission" in Korea, but also said that, on the contrary, it would further expand the U.S. military and continue its imperialist conspiracy in Korea, which is also a conspiracy against China.

In this statement, Truman also boasted that he hoped for peaceful negotiations, although such talk has long given the impression of being a blatant disguise. Everyone knows that all proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue have been met with hostility by Truman. If Truman were truly striving for peace, why did he reject the peace proposals of Korea and China at that time?

Truman accused Korea and China of "aggression." This can only be laughable. Is Korea or China attacking the United States? Are American troops not in Korea and Taiwan now? If Truman and his friends MacArthur, Harriman, etc. are not aggressors, then who are the aggressors?

Why doesn't China, which borders Korea, have the right to defend its border, while the United States, five thousand miles from Korea, has the right to "defend its security" five thousand miles from its own border? Where is the logic? Where is the justice? Therefore, who, other than a madman, can believe the peaceful intentions of Truman and his friends? Truman wants war, not peace. That is why he is immersed in new war hysteria.

    真理报斥杜鲁门声明
    “为什么与朝鲜接壤的中国没有保卫其边界的权利，而美国却有权
    利在本国边界五千英里之外‘保卫其安全’呢？”
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：真理报顷以《论杜鲁门在记者招待会上的声明——新战争歇斯底里》为题发表社论说：杜鲁门于十一月三十日在记者招待会上就朝鲜的最近形势发表公开的官方声明，其中不但重弹过去的滥调说美国政府不打算放弃其在朝鲜的“使命”，并且说，相反地还要更进一步扩大美国军队以及继续进行它在朝鲜的帝国主义的阴谋，也是对中国的阴谋。
    杜鲁门在这个声明中并且吹嘘他希望和平谈判，虽然这种谈论早已给人以显然是虚假的伪装的印象。大家都知道，朝鲜民主政府和中国人民政府的以和平解决朝鲜问题为目的的一切建议一概受到杜鲁门的敌视。如果杜鲁门真的努力争取和平，他当时为什么拒绝朝鲜和中国的和平建议呢？
    杜鲁门指责朝鲜和中国进行“侵略”。这只能令人好笑罢了，是朝鲜或中国在进攻美国吗？现在在朝鲜和台湾的不是美国军队吗？如果杜鲁门及其友人麦克阿瑟、哈里曼等不是侵略者，那么谁是侵略者？
    为什么与朝鲜接壤的中国没有保卫其边界的权利，而远离朝鲜五千英里的美国却有权利在本国边界五千英里之外“保卫其安全”呢？逻辑在那里？正义在那里？因此，除了疯子以外谁能相信杜鲁门及其友人们的和平意图呢？杜鲁门要战争，不要和平。正因为如此，他就昏迷在新战争歇斯底里之中了。
