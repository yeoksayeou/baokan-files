Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The powerful counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has swiftly shattered the so-called "war-ending general offensive" launched by MacArthur.

On the morning of November 24th, the arrogant and bloodthirsty aggressor MacArthur issued a special communique in a pompous manner, announcing that he was about to launch a "war-ending" general offensive in Korea, in which he declared that he would "compress and merge" the east and west pincers of the "tiger-head pliers." MacArthur also personally flew to the Korean front on the morning of November 24th to "order the Eighth Army of 100,000 men to attack the Yalu River." (United Press) According to a United Press report from Tokyo, MacArthur flew over the Yalu River on this day to "inspect." MacArthur, attempting to launch a war of aggression directly against the great Chinese people, had his "sight reach twenty or thirty miles beyond the river (referring to the territory of the People's Republic of China)." According to the same United Press dispatch, MacArthur also triumphantly told General Coulter, commander of the Ninth Corps, on this day: "Tell the officers and men that they can go home for Christmas."

At 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, the offensive of the U.S. invading forces was launched. On the same day, MacArthur's headquarters issued another communique. This communique boasted again: "The new offensive of the Allied Forces in Korea is progressing according to plan, our losses are extremely light, the morale of officers and soldiers is high, and the mission can be completed quickly." (United Press) Reuters reporter Betts also touted MacArthur's offensive, believing that "American, British, and South Korean troops, inspired by MacArthur's personal command on the front line and his promise to send them home before Christmas, are expected to break through the main defense line of the Communist army within twenty-four hours."

However, the American soldiers who were actually fighting on the front line were not as confident as these generals and reporters. An Associated Press dispatch on the 25th wrote: "One hundred and one thousand soldiers are advancing cautiously on a journey into suspicion. They are like a person walking through a strange, cold village in the twilight. He can't see anything that wants to harm him, but he is strangely uneasy, always feeling that someone is watching him in the dark." The U.S. invading forces were advancing towards the edge of death in such a state of bewilderment.

Sure enough, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in order to severely strike the frantically advancing enemy, launched a fierce counter-offensive starting on the 25th. This counter-offensive quickly "swept away the arrogant and confident official tone" (Reuters) of the U.S. military, gave the "United Nations forces" a stunning blow, causing it to "suffer a decisive defeat" (Associated Press), and made the U.S. military's battle line "as rough as a wood saw" (Reuters). Reporters from American, British, and French news agencies had to use words such as "deterioration," "collapse," "the worst setback," and "one of the worst failures in the war" to describe the shameful defeat of the U.S. invading forces. Even the spokesman of the U.S. First Corps was exclaiming "the situation is serious" (Reuters, Tokyo, 26th). Reuters reporter Betts, who had tried his best to tout the U.S. invading forces on November 24th, had to make a dispirited report on the 29th - a day he called "Dark Wednesday." He said: "What was seen on this day was the fall of city after city, and MacArthur's elite troops are now fighting only to avoid encirclement. The United Nations troops are suffering heavy casualties and equipment losses in their desperate fighting in the small mountains and narrow roads of the Northwest. The exhausted American soldiers are retreating while fighting a rearguard action."

Under the powerful blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the morale of the U.S. invading forces, facing a "military disaster," plummeted sharply. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on November 28th acknowledged this point. The dispatch stated: "Now, everyone from the trenches to the headquarters of the Eighth Army knows that the hope of going home for Christmas has been shattered, so morale is falling faster than the thermometer. The optimistic 'Christmas Home' attack of forty-eight hours ago has suffered the worst setback since the Korean War." Another United Press dispatch on the same day sadly admitted: The current morale of the U.S. invading forces "seems to be lower than the mercury in the thermometer." "The troops are very flustered and frightened. Terrible rumors are spreading, saying that the enemy will soon completely defeat them." (Associated Press reporter Bao Yier, 28th) This pessimistic and disappointed mood has even "greatly increased" among military personnel in Tokyo (Associated Press, 28th).

### 麦魔的“总攻”计划完全破产  面临“军事大灾难”的美军士气陡然低落

    麦魔的“总攻”计划完全破产
    面临“军事大灾难”的美军士气陡然低落
    【新华社一日讯】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队的强大反攻，迅速地粉碎了麦克阿瑟发动的所谓“结束战争的总攻势”。
    十一月二十四日早晨，狂妄的血腥侵略者麦克阿瑟趾高气扬地发表了一个特别公报，宣布他马上就要在朝鲜发动一个“结束战争”的总攻势，在这个总攻势中，他宣布要把“虎头钳”的东、西两钳，“压缩并合拢起来”。麦克阿瑟并于十一月二十四日清晨，亲自飞往朝鲜前线，“下令派遣第八军十万人向鸭绿江进攻。”（合众社）据合众社自东京报道，这一天，麦克阿瑟曾坐飞机飞到鸭绿江上空“视察”。妄图直接向伟大的中国人民发动侵略战争的麦克阿瑟“视线及于江彼岸（按指中华人民共和国的版图）二、三十里”。据合众社同上电讯称，麦克阿瑟这一天还曾经得意忘形地告诉第九兵团司令古尔特说：“你告诉官兵们说，他们可以回家过圣诞节。”
    二十四日上午八时，美国侵略军的攻势发动了。当天，麦克阿瑟总部发表了另一个公报。这个公报又夸口说：“韩境联军新攻势按照计划进展，我方损失极为轻微，官兵士气高昂，任务可迅速完成。”（合众社）路透社记者贝茨也替麦克阿瑟的攻势大吹大擂，认为“美国、英国和南朝鲜的部队由于受到麦克阿瑟亲临前线指挥和他答应于圣诞节前使他们回家的激励，可望在二十四小时内冲进共军的主要防线。”
    但是，真正在前线作战的美国兵却不像这些将军和记者们那么自信。美联社在二十五日发出的一条消息写道：“十万一千名大军是在走向疑境的旅程中，小心翼翼地前进着。他们好像一个人在暮色苍茫中穿过一个陌生的寒村。他望不见有什么东西要害他，但是他怪不放心地总觉得暗地有人在盯住他。”美国侵略军就是这样惶惑地向着死亡的边缘前进着。
    果然，英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队为了痛击疯狂进犯的敌人，自二十五日开始，发动了猛烈的反攻。这一反攻，迅速地使美军狂妄“自信的官方语调一扫而光”（路透社），它给了“联合国部队”一次打得目瞪口呆的打击，使它“遭到决定性的失败”（美联社），把美军部队的战线，“打得像一把粗糙的木锯一样”（路透社）。美、英、法通讯社的记者，不得不使用“恶化”、“土崩瓦解”、“最恶劣的挫折”、“战争中最坏的失败之一”等语句，来形容美国侵略军可耻的失败。甚至连美国第一兵团的发言人也在惊呼“情势严重”（路透社东京二十六日讯）。在十一月二十四日曾竭力替美国侵略军吹嘘的路透社记者贝茨，在二十九日——被他称为“黑暗的星期三”的日子不得不作了丧气的报道。他说：“这一天所看到的，是城市一个接一个的失陷，麦克阿瑟的精兵现在作战，仅得以避免包围而已。联合国的部队在西北的小山和狭隘公路上拚死作战中，损失很多的人员和装备。打得精疲力尽的美国兵一面要撤退，一面又要打殿后战。”
    在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队强有力的打击下，面临着“军事上的大灾难”的美国侵略军队的士气，是陡然低落了。合众社在十一月二十八日从东京发出的一则电讯，承认了这一点。该电称：“现在前线自战壕而至第八军司令部，人人皆知圣诞节回家的希望已告粉碎，故士气较之寒暑表的降落还要快。四十八小时以前乐观口吻的“圣诞回家”的攻击，已遭到朝鲜战争以来最恶劣的挫折。”合众社同日另一电讯悲哀地承认：美国侵略军队目前的士气“似乎比寒暑表里的水银柱还要低”。“军队很慌张、很恐惧。恐怖的谣言在散布着，说敌军不久就要把他们完全打垮。”（美联社记者包义尔二十八日电）这种悲观失望的情绪，甚至在东京的军事人员中，也“大大地增加”（美联社二十八日电）。
