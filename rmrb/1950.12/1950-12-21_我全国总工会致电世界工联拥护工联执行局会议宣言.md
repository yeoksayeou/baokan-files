Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has sent a telegram to World Federation of Trade Unions President Di Vittorio and General Secretary Saillant, endorsing the declaration to all trade union organizations and working people of the world and the resolution on the tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the struggle to defend peace, passed by the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting in Bucharest. The telegram reads as follows:

To Comrade Di Vittorio, President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Saillant, General Secretary:

The declaration and resolutions passed by the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting in Bucharest from December 1st to 7th are fully in line with the interests of the working people of the world. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the working class of China, warmly supports the declaration passed by the meeting, calling on the working people of all countries to launch a movement to defend peace and smash the imperialist aggression plan, and is willing to strive for its thorough realization.

Chinese workers will strengthen solidarity with workers in Asian countries struggling for national liberation, provide greater assistance to Korean workers and people, and resolutely oppose the criminal acts of US imperialism in expanding its war of aggression.

The patriotic production competition launched by the Chinese working class in the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, defend the country, and protect our homes has already achieved brilliant successes. This will make a major contribution to opposing US imperialist aggression and striving for peace. The Chinese workers are willing to join hands closely with the working people of the world and make the greatest efforts to stop a new war. The warmongers will eventually reap what they sow! The victories achieved by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the past two months are iron proofs that the aggressors headed by the United States are bound to fail, and that the people's forces fighting for world peace are bound to win!

                All-China Federation of Trade Unions
            December 20th

    我全国总工会致电世界工联拥护工联执行局会议宣言
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国总工会致电世界工联主席维多里奥和总书记赛扬，拥护世界工联执行局布加勒斯特会议通过的告全世界工会组织及劳动人民宣言和关于世界工联在为保卫和平而斗争中的任务的决议。电文如下：世界工联主席迪·维多里奥，总书记赛扬同志：
    世界工联执行局十二月一日至七日布加勒斯特会议所通过的宣言及决议是完全符合于全世界劳动人民的利益的。中华全国总工会代表全中国的工人阶级热烈拥护会议所通过的关于号召各国劳动人民展开保卫和平运动，粉碎帝国主义侵略计划的宣言，并愿为其彻底实现而努力。
    中国工人将加强与为争取民族解放而斗争的亚洲各国工人的团结，给与朝鲜工人和人民更大的援助，坚决反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的罪恶行动。
    中国工人阶级在抗美援朝卫国保家运动中所开展起来的爱国主义生产竞赛，业已获得辉煌的成就。这对于反对美帝国主义的侵略，争取和平的斗争将有重大的贡献。中国工人愿与世界劳动人民紧密地携起手来，为制止新的战争而尽最大的努力。战争贩子们终必自食其果，两个月来朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军所获得的胜利就是以美国为首的侵略者必然失败，为争取世界和平而斗争的人民力量必然胜利的铁证！?
