Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 24th: Factories and mines in the Central and Southern China region have exceeded their annual production plans ahead of schedule. They are now continuing their efforts to improve production to meet the new tasks of 1951. As of mid-December, the annual production plans for major products such as non-ferrous metals, cement, and electrical equipment under the Central and Southern Heavy Industry Department have been successively overfulfilled. The total output of refined tin in the region exceeded the annual plan by 39% at the end of November. The Henan Provincial Automobile Repair Factory, which completed its annual production task as early as October, also overfulfilled its monthly production task by 13% in November. The employees of a state-owned power plant completed their annual production task one month ahead of schedule and created a new record of 203 days of safe power generation under the slogan of "Eliminating Accidents and Ensuring Safe Power Supply." The quality of products from various factories and mines this year has significantly improved compared to last year. The average output of major products from a state-owned electrical equipment factory this year has increased threefold compared to last year, while the quality has consistently met the standards. A certain cement factory has corrected the problem of poor product quality. The ash content of coal from a state-owned coal mine has been reduced from 29.13% in the past to 17.78%. Many factory workers are now actively preparing to meet the new tasks for next year. Workshops and production teams of a state-owned electrical equipment factory are in the process of signing contact agreements and formulating plans for improving technology and increasing production efficiency for individuals and teams.

Harbin Cement Plant Completes Annual Plan in Nine and a Half Months
Workers' Wages Increase by Half, Living Standards Significantly Improve
[Report from this newspaper] The Harbin Cement Plant had exceeded its annual production target by 12.2% by October 28th. After the liberation of Harbin in 1947, workers worked hard in the freezing weather, moving stones, driving bridge piles, and shedding blood and sweat to repair the factory. Therefore, the workers especially cherish their factory and work with extra effort. Since officially starting production in January 1949, production has gradually increased, and the output has greatly exceeded the highest standards of the puppet Manchukuo era, with quality specifications reaching 500 grade pressure. This year, the annual production task was completed on September 16th. Because production has improved, workers' lives have also improved significantly: workers' wages have increased from over ninety points to two hundred and thirty points, and they live in newly built Western-style houses, with almost every dormitory having a radio. Now, all employees of the factory are enthusiastically carrying out patriotic production campaigns to produce more cement and enhance the strength of national defense.

Songjiang Paper Mill Learns from the Ma Hengchang Group's Experience
Completes Annual Plan One and a Half Months Ahead of Schedule
[Report from this newspaper] The Songjiang Paper Mill in Mudanjiang City completed its annual plan on November 15th, ahead of schedule. The promotion of the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group played an important role in completing the plan ahead of schedule during the production competition. For example, the two groups in the paper copying workshop learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, and the paper copying quota was automatically changed from the old quota of 33 rolls per day to the new quota of 38 rolls. In the patriotic production competition, they created a new record of 40 rolls per day.

Yanjing Paper Mill Transforms Tools and Overcomes Difficulties
Completes Annual Production Thirty-Five Days Ahead of Schedule
[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill completed its annual plan on November 25th, ahead of schedule. In the patriotic production competition, through the hard work of employees, the factory successfully modified the double-cylinder paper machine, thereby changing the phenomenon that production was often affected by raw material difficulties in the past. The factory originally had three Yuanwang paper machines, which could only produce inferior paper such as Pianyan paper, and the only raw material was waste paper, which often affected production due to insufficient raw materials. Now, the damaged No. 2 machine drying cylinder is combined with a Yuanwang paper machine and converted into a double-cylinder, double-copper-wire paper machine, which can use rice straw and rags as raw materials to manufacture two-sided glazed cultural paper, creating a new development situation for the factory.
