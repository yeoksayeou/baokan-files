    Beijing, Shanghai, and Other Places Youth Students and Youth Workers
    Warmly Respond to the Call to Participate in National Defense Construction
    Enrolling Enthusiastically and Requesting Recommendation to Military Cadre Schools
    [Reported by this newspaper] University and middle school students in Beijing enthusiastically request to participate in military cadre schools. More than 700 students from Tsinghua University have already made up their minds to participate. Tang Gengshan, Tang Lizhi, and 34 other fourth-year students from the Department of Aeronautics wrote to this newspaper, saying, "When one of our classmates saw the headline, he immediately jumped up and shouted: 'The call of the motherland has come!' Another classmate said, 'I'm not going to be an aeronautical engineer; I'm going to join the national defense army!' We have long been preparing to respond to all the calls of the motherland at all times. Today, the motherland is calling us, and glorious posts are waiting for us. We feel supreme glory and excitement!" The letter also described their discussion, and they believed that accelerating the strengthening of national defense is urgent at a time when U.S. imperialism is frantically invading our motherland. If U.S. imperialism does not allow us to build peacefully, we will defeat its aggression first and then build. Finally, they requested the government to approve all of them to participate in air force schools.
    Students from Jiaotong University's Beijing branch wrote letters of determination to the student union and the Communist Youth League branch, requesting the early establishment of a recommendation committee. All students in the third year of the Department of Transportation expressed: We can not only play a role in economic construction and cultural construction, but we must also participate in the serious struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace to test ourselves and show our great strength. Jiang Junming said: "I love my parents, sisters, and brothers, but I love my dear motherland more. In order to respond to the call of the motherland, I am determined to participate in a military cadre school." Many students are preparing to have a physical examination first to decide which military cadre school to attend.
    Wang Shibao, Yu Hongji, and a dozen other students from Beijing Agricultural University have all expressed their determination to participate in military cadre schools. Wang Shibao said, "I want to change from driving a tractor to driving a tank to fight for our beautiful and happy life!" Wang Weimin said: "In order for my younger siblings, our younger siblings, to be able to study well, I am determined to participate in the military cadre school for special forces, learn military skills, and defend the motherland!"
    Students from the Teachers University Affiliated High School, the Hui Nationality College, and the Municipal No. 5 Middle School also expressed with extraordinary enthusiasm that as soon as the recommendation committee is established, they will immediately sign up.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd] Shanghai students are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Central People's Government to recruit young people to participate in national defense construction and are signing up to participate in military cadre schools. In just one day yesterday, more than 40 people from two schools expressed their intention to sign up for the exam.
    After seeing the news in the newspaper yesterday morning, students from Hongkou Middle School excitedly sang the song "When the Motherland Needs Us" and held a discussion. More than 20 of the 44 students in one class in the second year of high school decided to sign up for the exam. A student named He Fei said: I have not forgotten my promise at the meeting to denounce the U.S. imperialist aggression: When the motherland needs me, I will definitely use concrete actions to show my love for the motherland. Now that the motherland has a call, I have decided to sign up for the military cadre school. A female student, Dai Lijuan, said: I have decided to participate in national defense construction. This is to make my parents' lives stable and happy, and to prevent my younger siblings from being ravaged by imperialism. The father of another female student, Chen Ruifang, was recently killed in Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. She realized that the one who instigated the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was U.S. imperialism, so she decided to learn military skills to defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and avenge her father.
    Yesterday, 17 students from Gezhi Middle School expressed their determination to sign up for the exam. Female student Da Youxian firmly said: During the Anti-Japanese War, my family was destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and my family wandered around. I personally saw the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, and I personally tasted the oppression of the enemy. Today, seeing the fallen enemy crawling up again with the support of U.S. imperialism, I can no longer tolerate it. I want to join the Air Force Cadre School to study and become a female air force pilot to eliminate the brutal aerial bandits.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd] Young workers and students in Changsha are enthusiastically responding to the call of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council regarding young students and young workers participating in various military cadre schools.
    The city is holding a congress of the Communist Youth League representatives. At the meeting, Zhang Binhuang, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposed in his political report that members of the Communist Youth League should actively take the lead in joining the national defense army and become the backbone of the national defense army. He called for the widespread development of this conscious and voluntary movement. The delegates immediately responded enthusiastically to Zhang Binhuang's call. Liu Shangxiong and Zhang Shici, representatives of private enterprises, expressed their readiness to sign up for naval and special forces schools. Feng Jiaqin and Chen Zhefu, representatives of schools, unhesitatingly expressed their response to the call of the motherland and their participation in the work of national defense construction.
    Students from various schools have now been mobilized. Chen Yueyun, a second-year student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Hunan University, said, "I have been waiting for the call of the motherland!" Guo Qihong, Chen Zhonggang, and 17 other students from the Provincial Changsha Advanced Industrial School have requested that the school recommend them. In addition, many students from the Provincial No. 1 Middle School, Mingde Middle School, and other schools are also preparing to participate in various military schools.
