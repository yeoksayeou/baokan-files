Xinhua News Agency, December 5th:

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued the following statement:
    Under the manipulation of the US-UK imperialist bloc, the United Nations Security Council brazenly and unreasonably vetoed the Chinese and Soviet accusations against US aggression, further exposing the imperialist bloc's insane intention to expand the war. We firmly support the speech of Wu Xiuquan, representative of the People's Republic of China. We resolutely oppose and protest the illegal and unreasonable veto under the manipulation of the imperialist bloc. We completely despise the veto of the imperialist aggressor group. No matter how the US imperialism and its voting machine display their shameless tricks, the Chinese people will continue to accuse the US of its aggressive crimes, and we will continue to raise our just demands until they are fully realized. The Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to invade Taiwan, and we have the determination and confidence to defeat any aggression by US imperialists. The Chinese people, who have stood up, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are determined to carry out the struggle against imperialist aggression, and firmly believe that this struggle will achieve final victory.

    【新华社五日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会联合发表声明如下：
    联合国安全理事会在美英帝国主义集团操纵下，公然无理否决中国和苏联控诉美国侵略案，更暴露了帝国主义集团决心扩大战争的疯狂意图。我们坚决拥护中华人民共和国代表伍修权的发言。我们坚决反对并且抗议在帝国主义集团操纵下的非法的无理的否决。我们完全蔑视帝国主义侵略集团的否决。不管美国帝国主义和他的表决机器怎样施展他们的无耻伎俩，中国人民对美国的侵略罪行，还要继续控诉，对于我们已经提出的正义要求，非至完全实现，还要继续提出。中国人民决不允许美帝侵略台湾，我们有决心和信心打败美国帝国主义者的任何侵略。已经站起来的中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，坚决进行反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，并且坚信这个斗争一定会获得最后的胜利。
