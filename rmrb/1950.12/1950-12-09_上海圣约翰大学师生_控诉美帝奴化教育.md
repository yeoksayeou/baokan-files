Shanghai St. John's University Faculty and Students
Accuse American Imperialism of Slave Education

    Large posters protesting Austin's absurd remarks appeared on the campus of Shanghai St. John's University on the 4th. At the same time, the university's registrar, deans of various colleges, heads of various departments, and representatives of the labor union and student union held an accusation meeting, angrily recounting how American imperialism controlled the activities of the school's faculty and students in the past, discriminated against Chinese professors, and implemented slave education. They unanimously pointed out that in the past, courses at St. John's University were mostly taught in English, even Chinese history and geography, which were also taught in English. This is a clear example of American imperialism carrying out slave education of the Chinese people. Professor Pan Shizi said: After the anti-American imperialist support for Japan movement in 1948, the American acting president of the school, Bu Qiji, asked him for a list of students who participated in this movement, and he was "reprimanded" for not "complying." He said: This kind of arbitrary suppression of Chinese students' patriotic actions and unreasonable behavior that insulted the freedom of Chinese professors completely proved the position of American imperialism in running education in China. Worker Yang Zuofeng said: Under the control of American imperialism, St. John's University stipulated that every school worker should wear a vest of a certain form for identification. This proves the discrimination of American imperialism against the Chinese working people. Chinese professor Huang Xinfu said: American imperialism particularly discriminated against Chinese professors. This is because Chinese professors had not studied in the United States. At the meeting, it was immediately decided to publish a protest letter, solemnly stating that all teachers, students, and staff of St. John's University will never allow any imperialism to sabotage or slander them. All teachers, students, and staff also decided to expand the accusations to publicize the aggressive crimes of American imperialism.

    上海圣约翰大学师生
    控诉美帝奴化教育
    上海圣约翰大学的校园里，四日即出现了抗议奥斯汀的荒谬言论的大幅布告。同时，该校教务长、各院院长、各系主任及工会、学生会代表，举行了控诉大会，愤怒地叙述过去美帝国主义如何控制该校师生的活动，歧视中国教授和实行奴化教育的情形。他们一致指出过去圣约翰大学的课，大都用英文教授，甚至连中国的历史、地理也都用英文教，这就是美帝国主义对中国人民进行奴化教育的一个明显例证。教授潘世兹说：一九四八年反对美帝扶日运动后，该校的美籍代理校长卜其吉曾向他要一份参加这一运动的学生名单，因为他没有“照办”而受到“训斥”。他说：这种任意镇压中国学生爱国行动和侮辱中国教授自由的无理行为，完全证明了美帝国主义在中国办教育的立场。工友杨作丰说：在美帝国主义控制下的圣约翰大学，规定每个校工要穿上一定形式的背心，以资识别。这证明美帝国主义对中国劳动人民的歧视。国文教授黄欣夫说：美帝国主义对国文教授是特别歧视的。这是因为国文教授没有到美国去留过学。会上当即决定发表抗议书。严正地表示圣约翰大学的全体师生、员工，是决不允许任何帝国主义来破坏或诬蔑的。全体师生、员工并决定扩大控诉，以宣传美帝国主义的侵略罪行。
