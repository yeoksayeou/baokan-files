    [Report from this newspaper] The Chongqing Military Control Commission, in response to the demands of people from all walks of life, has dissolved the "Chinese Mass Education Movement," which served American imperialism. Its affiliated institutions, such as the Rural Construction College, have also been taken over simultaneously. Since its establishment, the "Mass Education Movement" has been effectively controlled by Y.C. James Yen, concealing the essence of reliance on American imperialism under the guise of reformism. It colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government to carry out the reactionary task of helping American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek to invade and enslave the Chinese people subtly and insidiously from the cultural, economic, political, and military aspects.
    From 1927, the association's funding came entirely from American imperialists. In 1943, under the instruction of its American masters, Y.C. James Yen established the "Sino-American Joint Mass Education Movement" in New York, USA, to directly lead the activities of the Chinese "Mass Education Movement." All work plans and budget estimates of the "Mass Education Movement" in China had to be submitted to the committee for review and approval. In this way, Y.C. James Yen himself tore off the veil of reformism and openly turned the Mass Education Movement into a tool for American imperialism to invade and enslave the Chinese people.
    In 1937, Y.C. James Yen introduced Chen Kaisih, a member of the Mass Education Movement, to the puppet Sichuan Provincial Government to engage in an "experimental county" in Xindu, with Chen as the county magistrate. Under the banner of "experimental county", they cruelly oppressed and exploited the peasants. In 1938, this caused a peasant riot that armed and surrounded Xindu. Y.C. James Yen often praised this work of bloody rule over peasants in the "experimental county" as a "integration of security and police" system. This system naturally received the approval of the Kuomintang reactionary government and became the blueprint for the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" (the so-called "New County System") promulgated by the reactionary government in 1939.
    In 1948, alarmed by the rapid collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime and the brilliant victory of the people's liberation cause, Y.C. James Yen shamelessly and thoroughly exposed his true colors as a running dog of American imperialism. He openly proposed the so-called "Y.C. James Yen Act" for "reviving the Chinese countryside" to the U.S. Congress. In his speech in the United States, he said: "If we follow my plan and method, each Chinese person will only need six U.S. dollars, and communist ideas will not be able to enter their minds." Under the banner of anti-communism, the U.S. Imperialist Congress passed the bill, allocating one-tenth of the 270 million U.S. dollars in "Aid to China" loans used to assist Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people to establish the "China Rural Reconstruction Sino-American Joint Committee." With Americans, Bi Fanyu and Muir, and Chinese, Chiang Menglin, Y.C. James Yen, and Shen Zonghan as the five committee members, they carried out so-called social activities using economics and culture in the Chinese countryside, spreading a smoke screen of so-called "reformism." On the other hand, they used "U.S. Aid" to sell U.S. goods, engaging in hoarding, speculation, and profiteering. In the spring of 1949, the committee hoarded a large amount of cotton yarn, causing prices to skyrocket, causing significant damage to the citizens of Chongqing, which all citizens still remember vividly. However, the conspiracy of the "Mass Education Movement" did not stop there, it went even further and attempted to organize armed opposition to the revolution. In the "Draft Rural Construction Plan" formulated by the Huaxi Experimental Zone of the association, regarding rural self-defense construction, it said: "The equipment for this self-defense construction must be able to resist the sabotage of communist roaming troops, so each county must be equipped with a regiment of new weapons. The 11 county bureaus in this area need 11 regiments of weapons. The local government cannot raise the funds on its own. It is proposed that the Sino-American Joint Committee consult with the U.S. military delegation to allocate from the surplus materials in the Pacific, otherwise, please allocate 'U.S. Aid' of 200,000 yuan to purchase equipment and assist in self-manufacturing." This military conspiracy was not realized due to the brave advance of the People's Liberation Army and the rapid liberation of the Southwest.
    Secondly, the director of the Huaxi Experimental Zone, which was run by the association, was concurrently held by Sun Zerang, the puppet Sichuan Third District Administrative Commissioner. The heads of each guidance area under him were mostly puppet county magistrates or Kuomintang party secretaries. As for the Rural Construction College run by the association, the college site was forcibly purchased at a low price by the puppet government, regardless of the opposition of local farmers, and the school buildings were also built and repaired with funds allocated by the puppet Executive Yuan.
    After the liberation of the Southwest, Y.C. James Yen continued to accept money from American imperialists to support the association's activities. In a letter from Yen to Qu Junong, the acting general secretary of the association, he said, "We must raise more money in the United States"; "The United States and the Soviet Union are now preparing for war, and China should act as a mediator"; "You (referring to Qu) fight at the front, and I will fight at the rear." Clearly, American imperialism is using Y.C. James Yen as a so-called "democratic liberal," instructing him to use the so-called "middle route" and continue its conspiracy against the Chinese people through the "Mass Education Movement."
    The article "An Educational Plan by Which American Imperialism Conspires to Control China" published in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on November 19th said: "As for what kind of Chinese people should be employed for this work, American imperialism has also pointed out a typical representative in the 'plan,' namely Y.C. James Yen." Because Y.C. James Yen basically insists on the position of American imperialist aggression against China, but with the "scholar" as a cover, and the "Mass Education Movement" with a history of more than 20 years as a tool, running schools, factories, cooperatives, and other so-called "social undertakings," they attempt to deceive the Chinese people, anesthetize faculty, staff, and young students, and vainly attempt to eliminate the Chinese revolution through reformist methods. Therefore, Y.C. James Yen is an ideal person for American imperialism to use to invade China.
    In the current upsurge of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, the peasants near the Rural Construction College and the Huaxi Experimental Zone believe that this kind of undertaking sponsored by American imperialist money should not be allowed to continue its counter-revolutionary activities. The majority of teachers and students of the Rural Construction College and the staff of the association have also recognized the essence of the association in their current affairs studies and have risen up to oppose the conspiracy of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek to use the association as a reactionary tool, to thoroughly criticize the thought and activities of Y.C. James Yen, and unanimously demand that the government dissolve the association and take over its business institutions. The democratic parties and people in cultural and educational circles in Chongqing also have the same demand.
    Based on the above facts, the Chongqing Military Control Commission announced the dissolution of the "Chinese Mass Education Movement," and appointed Zhao Mengming as the military representative to take over the Chongqing Office of the association, Yao Dafei as the military representative to take over the Rural Construction College, Yang Chaozong as the military representative to take over the association's Beibei District institutions, and Hao Peimiao and Xiang Tianpei as the military representatives to take over the association's Huaxi Experimental Zone, and went to take over the association and its schools, factories, and all business institutions.

    重庆市军管会粉碎美帝侵华工具            
    解散反动组织“平教会”
    【本报讯】重庆市军管会应各界人民要求，解散了为美帝国主义服务的“中华平民教育促进会”，其所属乡村建设学院等机构亦同时予以接收。“平教会”自成立之日起，即由晏阳初实际主持，在改良主义的外衣下，掩蔽着投靠美帝国主义的实质，与蒋匪反动政府勾结，巧妙而阴险地从文化、经济、政治、军事各方面执行帮助美帝、蒋匪侵略和奴役中国人民的反动任务。
    从一九二七年起，该会经费即完全来自美帝国主义者。到一九四三年，由于其美国主子的授意，晏阳初在美国纽约成立“中美联合平民教育促进会”，直接领导中国“平教会”的活动，“平教会”在中国的一切工作计划、经费预算等等，均须送该委员会审查核定。这样，晏阳初就自行撕破了改良主义的外衣，公开地把平教会变成美帝侵略和奴役中国人民的工具。
    一九三七年，晏阳初介绍平教会分子陈开泗给伪四川省政府在新都搞“实验县”，以陈为县长，借“实验县”招牌，残酷地压迫剥削农民，一九三八年曾引起农民暴动武装包围新都事件。在“实验县”中施行对农民血腥统治的工作，晏阳初却常称道为“保警合一”制度，这种制度自然得到国民党反动政府的赞许，而成为一九三九年反动政府颁布的“县各级组织纲要”（所谓“新县制”）的蓝本。
    一九四八年，晏阳初悚于蒋匪反动政权迅速崩溃与人民解放事业的辉煌胜利，竟无耻地彻底露出其美帝国主义走狗的真面目，明目张胆地向美国会提出了所谓“复兴中国农村”的“晏阳初法案”。他在美国演讲时说：“如果照我的计划和办法，每个中国人只要用六块美元，共产主义的思想就不可能侵入他们的脑筋。”在反共旗帜下，美帝国主义国会通过了该案，从援助蒋匪屠杀中国人民的“援华”贷款二亿七千万美元中，拨出十分之一创办“中国农村复兴中美联合委员会”，以美国人毕范宇、穆懿尔及中国蒋梦麟、晏阳初、沈宗翰等五人为委员，一方面在中国农村中进行用经济、文化的所谓社会活动，散布所谓“改良主义”的烟幕；另一方面则利用“美援”推销美帝物资，作囤积居奇、投机倒把的勾当。一九四九年春季，该委员会囤积大批棉纱，招致物价飞涨，使重庆市民遭受重大损害，全体市民至今记忆犹新。然而“平教会”的阴谋并不止此，它还更进一步企图组织武装反对革命。在该会华西实验区所制订的“农村建设计划草案”中，关于农村自卫建设一项说：“此种自卫建设，其装备必须能抵抗共党流窜部队之破坏，故每县必须配备一个团之新式武器，本区十一县局，需十一个团之武器，地方无法自筹，拟请由中美联合委员会商请美国军事代表团从太平洋剩余物资中付拨，否则亦请拨‘美援’二十万元购置器材，协助自行制造。”该项军事阴谋，由于人民解放军奋勇进军，大西南迅获解放始未实现。
    其次该会所办华西实验区的区主任，是由伪四川第三区行政专员孙则让兼任，其下各辅导区的负责人，亦多为伪县长或国民党书记长担任。至于该会所办的乡村建设学院，院址是伪政府不顾当地农民反对，强迫低价征购而来，校舍也是伪行政院拨款补助建修的。
    西南解放后，晏阳初仍从美帝手中接受金钱，兑回支持该会的活动。晏在致该会代理总干事瞿菊农函中，有“要在美国筹更多的钱”；“现在美苏都在备战，中国应作调人”；“你（指瞿）打前方，我打后方”等语，很显然的，美帝是把晏阳初扮成所谓“民主自由主义者”，指使他运用所谓“中间路线”，通过“平教会”继续进行其反对中国人民的阴谋活动。
    十一月十九日重庆市新华日报所载《美帝阴谋控制中国的一个教育计划》文中说：“至于这一工作应该任用那一种中国人，美帝也在‘计划’中给指出了典型的代表，就是晏阳初。”因为晏阳初在基本上是坚持美帝国主义侵略中国的立场，但是，以“学者”作为外衣，又有二十几年历史的“平教会”作为工具，办学校、办工厂、合作社等所谓“社会事业”，他们企图欺骗中国人民，麻醉教职员工和青年学生，妄想用改良主义方法消灭中国革命。所以，晏阳初是美帝国主义利用来侵略中国的一个理想人物。
    在目前抗美援朝、保家卫国运动的高潮中，乡建学院及华西实验区附近的农民，认为不应听任此种由美帝金钱所举办的事业继续其反革命的活动；乡建学院大多数师生及该会工作人员也在时事学习中认清了该会本质，已经起来反对美帝、蒋匪利用该会作反动工具的阴谋，清算晏阳初思想及其活动，一致要求政府解散该会并接管其事业机构。重庆市各民主党派及文教界人士也同样有此要求。
    根据以上事实，重庆市军事管制委员会宣布解散“中华平民教育促进会”，并派赵孟明为接管该会重庆办事处的军事代表，姚大非为接管乡建学院的军事代表，杨朝宗为接管该会北碚区机构的军事代表，郝培苗、向天培为接管该会华西实验区的军事代表，分别前往接管该会及其所办的学校、工厂与一切事业机构。
