The Central People's Supervisory Committee's circular on handling the case of Lin Jie, manager of the former Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, and others violating policies and seeking personal gain is an important education for government personnel at all levels.

The mistakes made by Lin Jie and others are: first, as employees of a state-owned enterprise, they actually colluded to hoard pigments, attempting to make exorbitant profits; and then, they used their positions to purchase coal from the company for transport to the south during the government's ban on coal transport from Beijing to the south, even backdating the coal purchase dates and lowering the stipulated prices, blatantly violating policies and laws, causing damage to the prestige of the People's Government and the property of the state and the people.

The Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company is a state-owned trading organization, and its task should be to serve the people in accordance with the country's trade policies. It is an extremely serious phenomenon for such illegal and derelict actions as those of manager Lin Jie and others to occur in such an organization, and it should be taken seriously by the staff of the People's Government. This case was discovered through reports, and there may be other similar phenomena that have not been exposed, which should be given serious attention.

There is no doubt that the vast majority of government personnel at all levels are good and self-disciplined. However, those few who violate laws and regulations must be given the punishment they deserve.

Of course, this does not mean that, in order to prevent the use of power for personal gain, all personnel working in the People's Government organs cannot engage in industry and commerce themselves. All staff members who do not disengage from production in governments at all levels, as long as they comply with the laws and regulations of the People's Government and do not use their positions to obtain illegal profits for the industry and commerce they operate, all their legitimate industrial and commercial operations are completely permissible. Their industrial and commercial operations, like other private industrial and commercial operations that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, should be encouraged and assisted by the government.

As for personnel who originally engaged in industry and commerce but have now left production and joined the People's Government, they themselves or their families' industrial and commercial operations should no longer be managed by themselves and should be managed by others. At the same time, it is absolutely forbidden to use confidential information about industry and commerce as a tool for illegal profiteering. They must adhere to their duties and maintain confidentiality. Those who use their positions to seek personal gain should be subject to necessary penalties.

Of course, government staff who have never engaged in industry and commerce themselves or through their families must never be greedy for the convenience of working in the organs and use their positions to privately engage in commerce. Manager Lin Jie and others were punished by the People's Supervisory organs for making such a mistake.

This case was reported by Comrade Hu Yi of the Political Department of the Dingxian Military Sub-district, and Comrade Hu Yi has been commended in the circular. Article 19 of the Common Program stipulates that "the people and people's organizations have the right to accuse any state organ and any public servant of illegal or derelict acts to the people's supervisory organs or the people's judicial organs." Comrade Hu Yi's actions are in accordance with this provision of the Common Program. It is worthy of everyone's learning.

    决不容许公务人员利用职权营私图利
    中央人民监察委员会关于处理原北京煤铁分公司经理林洁等违反政策、营私图利案所发表的通报，是对各级人民政府工作人员的一个重要的教育。
    林洁等所犯的错误是：首先是以国营企业的工作人员，竟合伙购囤颜料，企图暴利；又复利用职权，在政府禁止北京煤炭南运期间，套购公司煤炭南运，甚至倒填购煤日期，降低规定牌价，悍然违反政策和法令，使人民政府的威信和国家人民的财产都受了损失。
    北京煤铁分公司是国营贸易机关，其任务应是依照国家的贸易政策，为人民服务。在这样的机关中，竟然发生如经理林洁等那样的违法失职的情事，对于人民政府工作人员来说，实在是异常严重的现象。这一案件系经人报告才获检查出来的，还没有被暴露出来的这一类现象可能还有，应该引起严重注意。
    毫无疑问，各级人民政府工作人员绝大部分是好的，是廉洁自守的。但对于少数违法乱纪者，则必须加以应得的处罚。
    当然，这并不是说，为了防范利用职权营私图利，在人民政府机关工作的一切工作人员，其本人均不能经营工商业。凡在各级政府中不脱离生产的工作人员，只要一切遵守人民政府法令，不利用职权使其所经营的工商业获得不法的利润，他的一切正当的工商业经营，是完全可以容许的。他们所经营的工商业，和其他有利于国计民生的私人工商业一样，应该得到政府的鼓励与扶助。
    至于原来经营工商业，现已脱离生产而参加人民政府工作的人员，其本人或家庭所经营的工商业，自己就不得再行兼管业务，应该另外请人经理。同时，绝对不得以所知道的有关工商业的机密，作为非法图利的工具。必须恪守职责，保守机密。利用职务，营私图利者，应受必要的处分。
    当然，本人或家庭原来就没有经营工商业的政府机关工作人员，就绝不能贪图在机关工作的便利，利用职权，私自兼营商业。经理林洁等就是由于犯了这样的错误，才受到了人民监察机关的处分。
    这一个案件，是定县军分区政治部胡毅同志报告的，通报中对胡毅同志已加以表扬。共同纲领第十九条规定：“人民和人民团体有权向人民监察机关或人民司法机关控告任何国家机关和任何公务人员的违法失职行为。”胡毅同志的这一行为，是符合于共同纲领这一规定的。应当值得大家学习。
