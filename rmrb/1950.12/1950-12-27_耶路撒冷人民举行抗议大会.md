Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv dispatch: Broad masses of people in Jerusalem, responding enthusiastically to the call of the Israeli Communist Party, held a demonstration on December 23 to protest against the American imperialists' rebuilding of the West German Nazi army, which had cruelly persecuted Jews. They held aloft banners reading "We need peace," "We want to live," and "The Israeli government must protest the establishment of a Nazi German army," broke through the obstruction of the government police, and victoriously held a protest rally in front of the American Consulate General.

Another dispatch: Communist members of the Israeli parliament and other progressive members have submitted a proposal demanding that the government protest the Brussels Conference resolution on rebuilding the West German army.
