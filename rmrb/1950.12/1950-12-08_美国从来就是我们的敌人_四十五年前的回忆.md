America Has Always Been Our Enemy
——Memories from Forty-Five Years Ago
Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University

In the vigorous movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, I recalled events from forty-five years ago.

That was in the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), precisely when the United States was continuously enacting Chinese Labor Exclusion Acts, intensifying insults, abuse, beatings, expulsions, and even massacres against Chinese residing in America. Huaqiao (Overseas Chinese) Feng Xiawei committed suicide outside the American Consulate in Shanghai, causing great anger among the people of China. Patriotic individuals from various provinces organized boycott associations, and a "Resist American Goods" movement unfolded across the country. The Manchu Qing government not only failed to support this spontaneous patriotic movement by the people but instead sought to suppress it. At that time, I was only twenty-six years old and was in Guangzhou managing a "Current Affairs Pictorial." To encourage anti-American sentiment, I published several cartoons, one of which was "Turtles Carrying Beauties," which stirred up a great storm. Because it was during the height of the boycott of American goods, a group of over two hundred American tourists came to Guangzhou. Guangzhou at that time, needless to say, did not have cars, and the roads were not even paved. When the American tour group arrived, the Manchu Qing officials, fearing the Americans and fawning over them, disregarded the people's opposition and insisted on entertaining the Americans, inviting them to ride in sedan chairs to tour around. The "Turtles Carrying Beauties" was a cartoon protesting the beauties riding in sedan chairs. It depicted two large turtles carrying a beautiful woman in a sedan chair, meaning that whoever carries a beauty in a sedan chair is a turtle. Such cartoons were posted everywhere and were indeed effective. The Manchu Qing officials could not find sedan chair bearers to serve the Americans, and in their embarrassment and anger, they ordered Nanhai County to arrest those responsible for posting the "Turtles Carrying Beauties" picture. At that time, a Mr. Ma, a Mr. Pan, and a Mr. Xia, who were giving speeches on the streets, were arrested. This was the famous "Ma, Pan, Xia" case in Guangdong at that time. The Mr. Xia was Xia Chongmin, a student of my Yiyu School.

In the serious situation at that time, everyone thought that these three men would be in danger and hoped that they would remain steadfast. People went to the prison to comfort them, bringing food and clothing, and held a pre-mortem memorial for Ma, Pan, and Xia, writing texts for the pre-mortem memorial, using public opinion as support, and the storm was very large. After the Americans left, the Manchu Qing officials ultimately did not dare to provoke popular anger, and Ma, Pan, and Xia were released from prison. However, this movement to boycott American goods lasted for more than a year. Feng Ziyou's Revolutionary Anecdotes says: "The Hong Kong Public Welfare Newspaper was sealed by the British government for publishing 'Turtles Carrying Beauties'." This also happened during this period. It can be seen that the Chinese people's movement against American imperialism already existed forty-five years ago. Unfortunately, there are too few historical materials recording these mass anti-imperialist movements, and these events are rarely mentioned.

In these forty-five years, we have only seen the beautiful coat that American imperialism wears, forgetting its hidden, very ferocious face, which is constantly invading and scheming against us. On the one hand, because Japanese imperialism intensified its oppression and invasion of us, leaving us no time to breathe; and on the other hand, because the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government relied entirely on American imperialism, propagating the benefits of America, we were ideologically deceived. Especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, people in the occupied areas of North China wholeheartedly hoped for victory in the war and believed that the United States was truly helping us fight Japan. We mistakenly believed that the United States was a good friend of China and paid little attention to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of our motherland's sovereignty. These erroneous ideas persisted until last year when the American imperialists published the White Paper, helplessly writing out a confession of the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism toward China. After learning, discussing, and studying in depth, we recognized the nature of American imperialism and understood its conspiracies and facts of aggression against China. Since June of this year, when American imperialism launched the Korean War and the Seventh Fleet invaded and occupied our Taiwan, in these five months, we have seen even more clearly the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism toward China, Asia, and the world.

Recently, several gentlemen have cited the story of "Painted Skin" from *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* to illustrate that American imperialism wears the skin of a beautiful woman on the outside, but inside is the face of a hideous monster. This analogy is very appropriate. Now, American imperialism has torn off its beautiful mask, revealing its extremely fierce and monstrous appearance. It wants to be crazy, it wants to eat people. At this time, if anyone still harbors illusions, considering whether America is an imperialist, that is either idiotic, or simply stupid; otherwise, it is a reactionary willing to be an accomplice to the tiger, or precisely a democratic individualist whom American imperialism hopes to exploit.

That being said, there are still some people in society who have "pro-American" and "fear-American" psychology. Therefore, our work to publicize Resist America and Aid Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, must continue to be carried out with redoubled efforts. Those who are "pro-American" have no national self-esteem. Those who "fear America" have no national self-confidence. Therefore, I believe that this propaganda work for Resist America and Aid Korea should not only awaken others but first educate ourselves. This work is not something that ends after a climax; it must be continuously propagated so that five hundred million people recognize that American imperialism is our mortal enemy, arousing common hatred against the enemy, and everyone must work hard. The paralysis of thought for many years cannot be completely eradicated in a short period, and the reactionary propaganda of rumors is also constantly being carried out. This is something we should pay close attention to and need to fight resolutely.

    美国从来就是我们的敌人
     ——四十五年前的回忆
    辅仁大学校长陈垣
    在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动中，我想起了四十五年前的往事。
    那是光绪三十一年（一九○五），正是美国续颁华工禁例，对中国旅美侨民加强侮辱，虐待，殴打，驱逐，甚至屠杀等暴行的时候，华侨冯夏威自刎于上海美领事馆门外，国内人民非常愤怒，各省志士纷纷组织拒约会，各地展开“抵制美货”运动。满清政府不特不予以支持，反而要取缔这个人民自发的爱国运动。那时，我才二十六岁，正在广州主持一个“时事画报”，为了鼓励反美情绪，出了好些漫画，其中有一张是“龟抬美人图”，引起了很大的风潮。因为正值抵制美货声中，有一批美国参观团二百多人来到广州。当时的广州不用说没有汽车，马路也还没有。美国参观团来了，满清的官吏害怕美国人，谄媚美国人，不管人民如何反对，对美国人当然要招待，请他们坐轿子到处游逛。“龟抬美人图”就是抵制美人坐轿的漫画。画了两只大乌龟，用轿子抬着一个美丽的女人，意思就说明谁要给美人抬轿，谁就是乌龟。这样的漫画，到处张贴，果然收效，满清的官吏竟找不到伺候美国人的轿夫，老羞成怒，就命南海县抓主使贴龟抬美人图的。当时抓去了在街头演说的一位姓马，一位姓潘，一位姓夏的，这就是当时广东很有名的“马潘夏”案件。这个姓夏的是夏重民，是我一个义育学堂的学生。
    在当时的严重形势之下，大家以为这三个人一定会遭危险，希望他们坚持不屈，纷纷到监狱慰问；有送吃的，有送穿的，又开了一个生祭马潘夏的大会，做了一些生祭马潘夏的文字，以舆论作后援，风潮闹得很大。等到美国人一走，满清的官吏究竟还不敢激动人民公愤，马、潘、夏就被释出狱了。可是这个抵制美货的运动前后支持到一年多。冯自由革命逸史说：“香港公益报因为刊载‘龟扛美人图’被英政府查封”。也是这时个期的事。可见中国人民反对美帝国主义的运动，远在四十五年前已有了。可惜记载这些群众反帝运动的史料太少，这些事还很少有人提起。
    这四十五年来，我们对于美帝国主义，只看他披上美丽的外衣，忘了他隐蔽着很凶恶的面孔，实在时时刻刻在侵略我们，计算我们。一方面也因为日本帝国主义加紧对我们的压迫侵略，来不及喘气；而蒋家反动政府又一味依赖美帝国主义，宣传美国的好处，使我们思想上受了蒙蔽。尤其是太平洋战争发动以后，在华北沦陷区的人，一心盼望抗战胜利，以为美国真是帮助我们在打日本，我们就糊里糊涂认为美国是中国的好友，对于蒋介石出卖祖国一切主权，反而不甚注意。这些错误思想，直到去年美帝发表白皮书，把美帝对中国一贯侵略的野心，无可奈何地写出了供状。我们经过学习讨论，深入研究，才认清美帝的本质，才了解美帝侵略中国的阴谋和事实。今年六月起美帝发动朝鲜战争，又以第七舰队侵占我台湾，这五个月来，我们对美帝侵略中国侵略亚洲侵略全世界的野心，更看得清清楚楚。
    近来有好些位先生举聊斋志异上《画皮》的故事，来说明美帝国主义外表披着一张美人的皮，里面是一副狰狞鬼怪的面孔，这个比喻很恰当。现在，美帝国主义已经撕毁了美人的假面具，现出了凶恶无比的怪相，它要疯狂，它要吃人。到了这个时候，如果有人还存幻想，考虑美国是不是帝国主义，那除了是白痴，只好说是愚蠢；不然，就是甘心为虎作伥的反动派，或者正是美帝所希望利用的民主个人主义者。
    话虽如此，但是社会上还有些人有“崇美”“恐美”心理，因此，我们宣传抗美援朝保家卫国的工作，还要再接再厉地进行。凡是“崇美”的，是因为没有民族的自尊心。凡是“恐美”的，是没有民族的自信心。因此，我认为这种抗美援朝的宣传工作，不但要唤醒别人，首先要教育自己。这种工作，并不是一个高潮过了就算完事，要继续不断的进行宣传，要使五万万人民都认清美帝是我们的死敌，引起敌忾同仇，还得要大家努力。多少年来的麻痹思想不是短短时期所能完全铲除的，何况反动派造谣宣传也在不断的进行，这是我们应该严密注意，而且需要坚决斗争的。
