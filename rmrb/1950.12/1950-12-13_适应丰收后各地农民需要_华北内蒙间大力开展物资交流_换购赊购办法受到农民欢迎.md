Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: North China and Inner Mongolia are vigorously promoting material exchange.

The quantity of materials needed for purchase and sale by farmers in North China after this year's bumper harvest is greater than it has been in the past thirteen years. In recent months, the people's governments at all levels in North China and Inner Mongolia have been treating the organization of material exchange as one of the main tasks in the North China region. In addition to purchasing cotton with cash, state-owned trading companies in various provinces have also generally signed contracts with cooperatives and farmers to purchase or exchange agricultural and sideline products on credit. Credit purchase contracts are for a period of one to three months. Under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, the company first purchases grain and cotton from farmers on credit, and pays farmers with various necessities or cash when the contract expires. The price of the original goods sold by farmers is allowed to rise but not fall. Both methods are welcomed by farmers. At the meeting of the heads of industry and commerce departments (bureaus) and cooperative directors of the five provinces and two cities in North China and Inner Mongolia held at the end of November, the cooperatives of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces signed barter contracts for native cloth and grain with the cooperatives of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces and Inner Mongolia. The Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative signed a contract with the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative to purchase 50,000 bolts of native cloth and 200,000 pieces of agricultural implements on each other's behalf.

Local people's governments paid attention to uniting private merchants to jointly develop material exchange. In addition to the fact that the industrial and commercial administrative departments of various provinces have appropriately adjusted the regional price differences of major commodities under the unified plan of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, so that private merchants can make profits from transportation, special districts in Pingyuan Province have invited representatives of private merchants to study methods for purchasing agricultural products and formulate purchase plans. The Cangxian Special District of Hebei Province further educated rural district and village cadres and farmers to unite with private merchants and provide various conveniences for private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase and sell goods. Encouraged by these measures, the number of private merchants going to the countryside to purchase agricultural and sideline products has gradually increased.

In order to facilitate material exchange, various parts of North China are also actively repairing roads and vigorously organizing freight transportation. Chahar Province mobilized 100,000 farmers to repair 10,000 kilometers of roads. Shanxi Province extensively carried out a campaign to repair bridges and roads, and added inns and warehouses on important roads to facilitate merchants. The Linfen Special District of Shanxi Province plans to repair 15 highways with a total length of more than 2,000 li; and prepare to mobilize 70 percent of the livestock and ox carts and 20 percent of the labor force in the region to participate in transportation. The Tongxian Special District of Hebei Province plans to organize 3,500 rubber-wheeled carts, handcarts, and 20,000 porters this winter; currently, only Tongxian and Liangxiang counties have mobilized 500 carts to start material transportation. Guihua City in Suiyuan Province has organized 3,000 camels, divided into three batches, to go to various counties in the province, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu Province to exchange industrial products such as cloth, sneakers, cigarettes, brick tea, porcelain, and matches for local products such as livestock, fur, grain, and felt.

After the bumper harvest this autumn, farmers in North China urgently need to sell large quantities of surplus grain, cotton, and local products, and purchase large quantities of means of production and living materials. Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone have 1.4 billion jin of grain to be sold, and farmers need 6.3 million bolts of cotton cloth. The cotton producing areas of Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces need to sell 250 million jin of cotton; among them, farmers in Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province alone need to purchase 67 million jin of coarse grains, 220,000 pieces of agricultural implements, 23 million jin of kerosene and edible oil, and 300,000 tons of coal.

    适应丰收后各地农民需要
    华北内蒙间大力开展物资交流
    换购赊购办法受到农民欢迎
    【新华社八日讯】华北和内蒙区正大力开展物资交流。
    华北农民在今年丰收后所需购销的物资，数量之大，为十三年来所未有。几个月来，华北及内蒙区各地人民政府曾将组织物资交流作为华北区当前主要工作之一来进行。各省国营贸易公司除以现金收购棉花外，很多地方并普遍通过合作社和农民订立合同，赊购或换购农、副产品。赊购合同为期一至三个月不等，在公私两利原则下，先由公司向农民赊购粮食、棉花，合同满期时，以各种必需品或现金偿付农民，农民所售原货作价听涨不听落。换购合同是农民以粮食、棉花和公司的工业品当场换购。两种办法都受到农民欢迎。在十一月底召开的华北五省二市和内蒙区各地人民政府的工商厅（局）长、合作社主任会议上，河北、平原两省合作社更和晋、察、绥三省及内蒙合作社订立了土布和粮食的换购合同，平原省合作社和山西省合作社订立了相互代购五万匹土布和二十万件农具的合同。
    各地人民政府注意了团结私商共同开展物资交流。除了各省工商行政部门在中央人民政府贸易部统一计划下，已适当调整了主要商品的地区差价，使私商贩运有利可图以外，平原省各专区都曾邀请私商代表研究收购农产品的办法，订定收购计划。河北省沧县专区更教育农村区、村干部和农民团结私商并给私商下乡购销以各种方便。在这些措施的鼓励下，各地私商下乡收购农副业产品的已经日渐增多。
    为了便利物资交流，华北各地又正在积极修整道路，大力组织货运。察省曾动员十万农民，修整了公路一万公里。山西省广泛开展了修桥补路运动，并在重要道路上增设客店、货栈，便利商客。山西省临汾专区计划修整公路十五条，长达二千多里；并准备发动全区百分之七十的牲畜和牛车，百分之二十的劳动力参加运输。河北省通县专区计划在今冬组织胶皮轮大车三千五百辆，手推车及驮贩二万人；目前仅通县、良乡两县已经动员大车五百辆开始物资运输。绥远省归绥市则已组织起三千匹骆驼，分三批去该省各县、内蒙及甘肃等地，以布匹、球鞋、纸烟、砖茶、磁器、火柴等工业品，换购牲畜、皮毛、粮食、毡等土产。
    按华北农民在今秋丰收后急需售出大量剩余的粮食、棉花和土产，购进大批生产资料和生活资料。仅山西、察哈尔、绥远三省和内蒙自治区，就有十四亿斤粮食待售，农民对棉布的需要量达六百三十万匹。河北、平原、山西三省棉产区则需售出棉花两亿五千万斤；其中只平原新乡专区农民，即需购粗粮六千七百万斤，农具二十二万件，煤油、食油二千三百万斤，煤三十万吨。
