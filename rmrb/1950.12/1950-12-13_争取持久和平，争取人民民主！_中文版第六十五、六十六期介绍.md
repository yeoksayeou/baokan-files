    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Issues 65 and 66 of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" have been published.

    Issues 65 and 66 of the journal are both special commemorative issues for the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The editorial in this issue is titled "The Soviet Union - The Great Banner of Peace." It also includes the essay "The October Revolution and the Chinese People" written by Zhu De, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as commemorative articles by Gottwald, leader of the Czech Communist Party, Foster, leader of the American Communist Party, Gheorghiu-Dej, leader of the Romanian Communist Party, Chervenkov, leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Pieck, leader of the German Communist Party, Duclos, leader of the French Communist Party, Bierut, leader of the Polish Communist Party, and Ibárruri, leader of the Spanish Communist Party.

    The editorial in the journal, titled "The Soviet Union - The Great Banner of Peace," points out that the great social changes carried out by the Soviet people over the past thirty-three years have turned the socialist society dreamed of by people with lofty ideals for many years into a living reality. These ironclad facts prove that the liberated working class can successfully manage the country, can control the economy without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie, and prove that, regardless of the frantic resistance of internal and external enemies, it can successfully build and will build socialism, and prove that socialism is far superior to capitalism. The editorial said: Even though imperialism has become frantic in its death throes, it has no power to reverse the wheels of history. The great socialist October Revolution has pointed out a path to a new life for the working people and exploited masses of the world, a correct path to eliminate exploitation and national oppression, a path to liberation from the shackles of imperialism, from hunger and death.

    Issue 66 of the journal publishes the report by Bulganin on November 6, 1950, at the Moscow Soviet's celebration of the October Revolution Day, titled "The 33rd Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (which was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on November 8). It also publishes two articles commemorating the October Socialist Revolution: "With the Soviet Union - Striving for Peace and Realizing Socialism" written by Koubský, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and "The Great October Revolution and the Albanian People" written by Hoxha, General Secretary of the Albanian Workers' Party.

    This issue of the journal also prominently features the article "The Patriotic Emulation in Vietnam" written by Dinh, Secretary of the Vietnam Lien Viet (National United Front) Zone.

    该刊第六十五、第六十六期都是苏联十月革命三十三周年的纪念特刊。本期的社论题为《苏联——伟大的和平的旗手》。另外登载了中国共产党中央政治局委员朱德写的《十月革命与中国人民》的论文以及捷共领袖哥特瓦尔德、美共领袖福斯特、罗共领袖乔治乌——德治、保共领袖契尔文科夫、德共领袖皮克、法共领袖杜克洛、波共领袖贝鲁特、西共领袖伊巴露丽等的纪念文章。
    该刊题为《苏联——伟大的和平的旗手》的社论中指出，苏联人民三十三年来所进行的伟大的社会变革，使多年以来志士仁人所梦寐以求的社会主义社会变成活生生的现实。这些铁的事实证明解放了的工人阶级能够成功地管理国家，能够在没有资产阶级以及反对资产阶级的情形之下掌握经济，并且证明，不管内外敌人进行疯狂的抵抗，它能够成功地建设并将建设社会主义，并且证明社会主义大大优越于资本主义。社论说：帝国主义纵然在垂死的挣扎中变得疯狂，但是它们没有力量来倒转历史的车轮。伟大的社会主义的十月革命已经向全世界劳动人民与被剥削的群众指出了一条道路，走向新的生活，走向消灭剥削与民族压迫的正确道路，这是一条从帝国主义的束缚中、从饥饿与死亡中获得解救的道路。
