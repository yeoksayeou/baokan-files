He emphasized that it is extremely important for the American people to implement the decisions of the Warsaw Congress, and no difficulties can hinder the peace fighters. We must fight, and continue to fight, to strive for peace and for a strong friendship between the Soviet and American people.

Professor Roberts finally thanked the leaders of the All-Soviet Committee in Support of Peace for their warm welcome and sincere hospitality on behalf of all the delegates.

The American delegation subsequently visited Leningrad and returned to Moscow on the 1st.

When talking about his impressions of visiting Leningrad, delegation leader Professor Roberts said: We saw a lot in Leningrad, and all of this will be unforgettable. Every day spent in the Soviet country makes us feel closer to the Soviet people. When we return home, we will definitely tell the American people about the great achievements of the Soviet country. We must strengthen the friendship between the American and Soviet people—this is the guarantee of lasting peace.

When the American delegation departed, representatives of the Leningrad trade unions went to the Moscow Railway Station in Leningrad to see them off. They presented flowers to the departing guests. American delegation member Hollins said in reply: "Peace will surely eliminate war! Friends, move forward, for the unity of the workers, for world peace!"
