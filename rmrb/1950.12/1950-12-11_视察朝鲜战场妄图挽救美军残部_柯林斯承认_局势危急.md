    Xinhua News Agency, December 10th -- The powerful counter-offensive by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has caused extreme panic among the American aggressors. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins, under orders from the U.S. government, hastily flew to Tokyo on the 4th to hold "secret consultations" with MacArthur, and conducted an aerial inspection of the Korean battlefield. According to a United Press report on the 4th, his purpose was to try to salvage the fate of the seven and a half U.S. divisions in Korea, which constitute "three-quarters of the entire U.S. Army," from being annihilated. Upon his hurried return to Washington on the 8th, Collins admitted that "the situation is critical" and immediately reported on the Korean military situation to Truman and Attlee.
