	Difficult Years, Fighting People
	--Glimpses of Northern Vietnam, Part 1
	By Our Special Correspondent Meng Qing

	In the autumn of this year, on the eve of the Cao Bằng–Lạng Sơn Campaign, I visited Việt Bắc, the main base area of the Vietnamese resistance war.

	After a long journey, I finally arrived in the heart of the Vietnamese liberated area. Like an old friend after many years of separation, the Vietnamese comrades welcomed this unfamiliar guest from afar. From the firm, strong handshake upon entering, from the excitement on the face of the southern girl busily bringing us bananas and pineapples, I felt a unique emotion. This emotion arose not because I was a Vietnamese Chinese, who had spent sixteen similarly bitter years in this land of suffering, but because I was a journalist from the new China. In the most perilous days, China's victory had pulled a knife from the back of the Vietnamese people, replacing it with the first statement recognizing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. For a nation in combat, this was an incredibly powerful encouragement.

	My lodging was a small bungalow in the forest, with an oil portrait of President Ho Chi Minh hanging prominently in the living room, flanked by a few watercolor paintings. The house and furniture were all made of bamboo, small and exquisite. Under the difficult material conditions of the liberated area, these arrangements demonstrated that Vietnam is a nation that loves art.

	During the ten-plus days of traveling in Việt Bắc, I climbed mountains and waded through rivers, constantly changing modes of transportation: riding livestock, walking, taking horse-drawn carriages and small boats. The scenery along the way and the lives of the people constantly reminded me of the guerrilla base areas in China a few years ago.

	On both sides of the road were large mountains, densely forested. In some places, one could not emerge from a large bamboo forest for an entire day. From the flatlands, one could only see undulating forests towering into the clouds.

	Most of the cities I passed through had been turned into ruins. In many places, weeds completely covered the remaining walls, making it impossible to tell that this had once been a bustling street. This scene evoked memories of the past: in December 1946, after the French army launched a full-scale offensive in Vietnam, they used planes and tanks as cover, bombarding the major cities along the highways with artillery and machine guns; paratrooper units landed in places like Cao Bằng and Bắc Kạn. I was still in Vietnam at the time, and the scene of the French army attacking Lạng Sơn is still vivid in my memory. I remember a small street along the river next to the iron bridge, where two giant tanks blocked both ends of the street, and bullets from small cannons and heavy machine guns were fired densely into the center of the street. The Vietnamese self-defense forces and civilians tunneled through the walls of all the houses, fighting back and forth inside. After several hours, all human voices and gunfire gradually quieted down. The next morning, French soldiers forced laborers to throw the corpses on the street into the river. An old woman participating in the removal told people that the houses she entered were full of corpses, and in one courtyard, five young female nurses lay in a pile of bodies, their snow-white coats stained with bright red blood. On the third day, people still saw laborers using wooden sticks to push the bodies piled up on the riverbank into the rushing current.

	In the face of the enemy's temporary advantage, the young Vietnamese People's Army abandoned the cities, taking the people with them to the Việt Bắc interzone to wage a persistent struggle.

	In the Việt Bắc interzone, aside from a few small villages along the rivers, most people lived in small thatched huts built on the mountainsides, scattered widely. They also had "shelters" on the high mountains. Whenever the French army attacked, everyone would run up the mountain, preventing them from finding a single person or a single grain of rice. When the French army left empty-handed and returned in frustration, they often encountered ambushes by the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas, who beat them to pieces, disheartening them. The larger the scale of the French colonial army's "mopping-up" operations, the more tragic the casualties. I met a regimental commander of the Vietnamese People's Army, around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, who was known as a master of ambushes. In the four years of the war of resistance, he had fought countless successful ambush battles. Once, on Highway 4, they intercepted a French army motorcade and burned more than 100 enemy vehicles. There were many magical legends about this master of ambushes. The enemy described him as a fierce man with a blue face and fangs, but in reality, he looked exactly like a scholar. Before joining the revolution, he had studied at the French University in Hanoi. The arrogance and brutality of the colonialists educated this Vietnamese youth far more than those finely bound foreign dogmas. Therefore, before graduating, he joined the ranks of the people's liberation, becoming a mortal enemy of the French colonialists.

	This was a struggle of life and death. Taking advantage of their initial military superiority, the French brutally slaughtered the Vietnamese people, destroyed their production, and used every means to blockade the liberated areas, trying to starve these stubborn Vietnamese people who refused to "convert." However, as soon as the mopping-up troops left, the people immediately returned to cultivate the land and reclaim wasteland on the mountains. In the mountains of Việt Bắc, as long as the forests were burned and a type of dry rice was sown, there was no need for transplanting, fertilizing, or weeding. After four months, it would yield good grain. Lush wild bananas grew everywhere on the barren mountains, mixed with various tropical broad-leaved plants. The people seen along the way all wore belts around their waists and carried a machete on their backs. They went back and forth in the mountains, cutting bamboo and felling trees, using it as a tool to open roads and also as a weapon for self-defense.

	Everyone in the liberated areas worked and produced, and no one went hungry. The democratic government confiscated the land of the enemy and traitors and distributed it to the peasants, and rent reduction work had been widely implemented. In addition, the government also provided large loans to farmers, encouraging them to help each other in production. In the past, the rice fields of Việt Bắc were only planted once a year. Recently, the Vietnamese government called on the people to increase production. In addition to working hard to reclaim wasteland, many places strove to plant twice a year. Bắc Kạn Province this year increased the harvest of more than 1,000 mu of land by one time.

	Despite the difficult living conditions, the people enthusiastically paid land taxes and public grain, and often tightened their belts, voluntarily donating to the country. One day, I saw an old woman grabbing an extra handful of rice and putting it into a bamboo tube while cooking. She told me, "Every household here saves a handful of rice every day. After a while, they hand it over to the township office to donate to the troops as military rations." In 1949, President Ho Chi Minh called on the people to donate and sell rice at a low price to the troops in order to celebrate the Vietnamese Independence Day on September 2nd. Immediately, a movement spread throughout Vietnam to "sell Ho Chi Minh rice" at a quarter of the market price. Some poor people voluntarily went up the mountains to chop firewood and exchanged it for rice to sell to the government. Within two weeks, the total number of donations and sales nationwide reached 100,000 tons. An elderly farmer said to me, "The French want to 'strike at the Viet Minh's stomach' (note), but we want to feed the soldiers of the National Guard so that they can smash the heads of these invading robbers."

	In the difficult years, the Vietnamese people fully demonstrated their tenacious and unyielding fighting spirit.

	Note: At present, the main policies of the French aggressors in Vietnam are political division and economic destruction and blockade. Their slogan is: "Strike at the Viet Minh's stomach."

### 艰苦的年月，战斗的人民——越北见闻之一

    艰苦的年月，战斗的人民
    ——越北见闻之一
    本报特约记者  孟青
    今年秋天，在高平谅山战役的前夕，我访问了越南抗战的主要根据地越北。
    经过了一段长途跋涉，我终于到达越南解放区的腹地。像多年离别的老朋友，越南的同志们欢迎这远道到来的不相识的客人。从一进门紧紧有力的握手，从那位来回忙碌地给我们端香蕉、菠萝的南国女郎脸上的兴奋，我感受到一种异样的情感。这种情感的产生，并非因为我是一个越南华侨，曾经在这块苦难的土地上度过十六载和他们一样辛酸的年月，而因为我是新中国的一个新闻记者。在最艰危的日子里，中国的胜利给越南人民拔掉了一把插在背后的刺刀，而代之以第一个承认越南民主共和国的声明。对于一个在战斗中的民族，这是何等有力的鼓舞。
    我的住处是在森林中的小平房，客厅当中正面挂着胡志明主席的油画像，两旁配几幅水彩画。房屋和家俱，全部用竹子造成，小巧而精致。在解放区困难的物质条件下，这些布置表现出越南是个爱好艺术的民族。
    在越北旅行的十多天中，爬山涉水，不断地替换交通工具：骑牲口，步行，乘坐马车和小船。沿途景色和人民的生活，使我不断想起几年前中国的游击根据地。
    公路两旁都是很大的山岭，森林茂密，有些地方整整一天没有走出一片大竹丛。从平地远望，只看见耸入云际的高低起伏的树林。
    我所经过的一些城市，绝大多数都已变成废墟，许多地方野草把残垣全掩盖了，看不出这儿曾经是热闹的市街。这种情景引起我对于往事的回忆：一九四六年十二月，法军在越南发动了全面进攻以后，借着飞机、坦克的掩护，用大炮和机关枪轰击公路沿线的大城市；伞兵部队在高平和北?等地降落。当时我还在越南，法军攻击谅山的一幕，在我的记忆里印象犹新。记得就在铁桥旁沿河边的一条小街，两架巨型坦克车封锁了两头街口，小钢炮和重机关枪的子弹密集地向街心发射。越南自卫队和民众把所有房屋的墙壁都凿通了，在里面来回还击。几个钟头之后，一切人声和枪声逐渐静寂下来。第二天早上，法国士兵迫着民工把街上的尸体往河里丢。参加搬运的一位老太太向人说，她走进的几间房子都是满地死尸，在一家院子里有五个年轻的女看护躺在尸堆里，雪白的外衣上染满了鲜红的血污。第三天，人们还看见民工用木棒把积压在河边的尸体往急流处推。
    幼年的越南卫国军在敌人的暂时优势的情形下，放弃了城市，带着民众转移到越北联区，进行坚持的斗争。
    在越北联区，除了沿着河川有些小庄子外，民众多在山边搭起小茅庐，住得很分散。他们在高山上都另有“避舍”，每当法军攻来，大家就跑上山，不让他们找到一个人，找到一粒米。等到法军扑了空，懊丧地回去的时候，常遭遇越南卫国军和游击队的伏击，被打得七零八落，胆丧心寒。法国殖民军队的“扫荡”的规模愈大，伤亡也就愈惨。我遇到过一位二十七、八岁左右，被誉为伏击圣手的越南卫国军的团长，在抗战四年中，他曾打过无数次成功的伏击战。有一回，在第四号公路上，他们截击了法军一个汽车兵团，烧毁了敌人一百多辆汽车。有许多关于这位伏击圣手的神奇的传说。敌人把他描写成一个青面獠牙的凶汉，实际上他的样子完全像个书生。在参加革命以前，他曾在河内的法国大学念过书，殖民主义者的专横和残暴，对这个越南青年的教育，远胜过那些精装本子的洋教条。于是，不等到毕业，他就投入了人民解放的队伍，成为法国殖民者的死对头。
    这是一场生与死的搏斗。法国人借着初期的军事优势，残酷地屠杀越南人民，破坏他们的生产，用尽一切办法封锁解放区，要饿死这些倔强不肯“归化”的越南人民。然而，扫荡的队伍一走，民众立刻回来耕种，并且在山上开荒。越北的山地，只要把树林烧掉，播下一种旱稻，不用插秧，也不用施肥除草，四个月之后，就能结出很好的谷子。荒山上到处生长起茁壮的野芭蕉，夹杂着各种热带的阔叶植物。沿途所见的民众，腰间都扎一条带子，背后插一把柴刀。他们在山中来往，砍竹伐木，用它作开路工具，同时也是自卫的武器。
    解放区的人民，大家都劳动生产，没有人挨饿。民主政府没收了敌人及越奸的土地分给农民，减租工作已普遍实施。此外，政府还大量贷款给农民，鼓励帮忙群众生产。过去，越北的稻田每年只种一次，最近越南政府号召人民增加生产，群众除了努力开荒外，许多地方都争取每年种两次，北?省今年就有一千多亩地增加了一倍收成。
    尽管生活很困难，但群众缴纳田税和公粮非常踊跃，还经常节衣缩食，自动捐献给国家。有一天，我看见一位老太太在煮饭的时候，另外抓出一把米放进一个竹筒子。她告诉我：“这里每户人家每天都储蓄一把米，过了相当时间，交到乡公所去，捐给部队作军粮。”一九四九年，胡主席号召人民，为了庆祝九月二日的越南独立节，献卖平价米给部队。立即，全越南到处都展开一种运动，按照市价的四分之一“卖胡志明米”。有些穷苦的群众，自动上山打柴，回来换米卖给政府。在两个星期之内，全国献卖总数达十万吨。一个年老的农民对我说：“法国人要‘打越盟的胃’（注），我们却要叫卫国战士们吃饱，好敲碎这些侵略强盗们的脑袋。”
    在艰苦的年月里，越南人民充分表现了他们顽强不屈的战斗精神。
    注：目前法国侵略者在越南的主要政策是政治上的分化和经济上的破坏封锁，他们的口号是：“打越盟的胃”。
