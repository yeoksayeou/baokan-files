    MacArthur's "Offensive"
    Sha Ou, Poem
       Fang Cheng, Painting
    MacArthur didn't even have time for breakfast,
    He hurriedly flew to the Chongchon River front,
    It was barely dawn, the snow wind was blowing hard,
    Freezing him so he turned his coat collar up.
    He wanted to command a "miracle,"
    The general truly had a "tiger tongs" in his heart:
    Compressing and merging from the northwest and northeast,
    One reach and it was like touching the Yalu River border.
    The general was very pleased with his strategy,
    Deeply believing this would turn the situation around;
    He arrogantly blew another big boast,
    Saying "Christmas" would definitely see complete success.
    "Christmas" to go home,
    American soldiers seemed a little happy about it;
    Although "Thanksgiving" had long passed,
    The check cashed only brought trepidation!
    But some American soldiers still wrote home,
    Asking their wives to prepare Christmas dinner early;
    Some also wrote to their friends back home,
    Saying after "Christmas" they needn't worry anymore.
    The American soldiers hiding in "Arctic sleeping bags,"
    Also poked their heads out,
    Sighing and saying home is still better,
    Home is definitely warmer than a sleeping bag.
    Those advisors holding small mirrors,
    Also happily narrowed their eyes,
    Thinking white hair would stop growing,
    Deciding to dye their hair before going home to see their wives.
    That freezing Philippine battalion,
    Also quietly discussed it,
    Whispering that suffering "discrimination" didn't matter,
    As long as they could leave Korea on "Christmas."
    Syngman Rhee drooled with anticipation,
    So happy he wagged his tail round and round,
    He secretly thought his great country would be securely established,
    From the bottom of his heart thanking his American father for his immense kindness.
    MacArthur "inspected" the Yalu River,
    Then, with his pipe in his mouth, returned to his mansion in Tokyo,
    He was almost carried away by his triumph,
    And even hugged a Japanese dancer, laughing and joking for a while...
    Start boasting! His "headquarters" issued a "communique,"
    And the "Voice of America" babbled and shouted,
    Not afraid of blowing the roof away and breaking down the walls,
    Look at him standing in front of the map with his neck stretched out.
    With a crack, the order for "general offensive" was given,
    But the confidence of the American soldiers was a bit lacking,
    Like a person walking through a cold village at dusk,
    All shivering, not daring to glance around.
    Who knew that just one day later, there was a thunderous crash,
    A downpour that darkened the sky and the earth,
    The People's Army came surging like an avalanche,
    Truly like heavenly soldiers descending to earth!
    Only the sound of bullets like a torrential rain,
    The booming of cannons splitting the sky,
    There was a gap here, it couldn't be blocked!
    The retreat there was cut off!
    The American military line became a crude wooden saw,
    Terrible! This corps was smashed again,
    My God, that division's "situation is unknown" again,
    Stupid pigs! Why aren't you scrambling backwards!
    Losing your gun doesn't matter, it doesn't matter,
    As long as your life is preserved!
    Blame my mother for giving me too few legs,
    And I don't even know which direction is safest!
    "The situation is serious! The situation is serious!"
    MacArthur's face turned green with anger,
    Where did the general's prestige go?
    His pipe didn't even emit smoke.
    "Retreat, retreat, retreat—"
    The "offensive" became like an egg hitting a rock,
    How many were killed or wounded, who had the mind to calculate,
    Cold water poured down his back, the general's face was covered in cold sweat.
    He paced back and forth with his pipe,
    Then he sat down at his desk,
    His two eyebrows silently joined together,
    His shiny leather boots heavily stepped on the carpet...
    "Christmas to go home" became a soap bubble again,
    The color was good, but unfortunately it burst too quickly!
    It doesn't matter, there's still "Easter,"
    Oh well! If not this year, then next year!
    Look, the American soldiers are running exhausted,
    Order is not worth a stinking penny,
    Please don't ask what is called "morale,"
    It's much lower than the mercury column on a cold day!
    Cries of "father" and "mother" go unanswered,
    At the sight of bayonets, their hearts beat like drums,
    Three or four people in a heap, twenty or thirty people in a bunch,
    Some were scared silly, some had their butts in the air!
    The "Arctic sleeping bags" were long forgotten,
    Too bad! What to do at night?
    Ice forming on the nose is a small matter,
    At the sound of a gunshot, only the legs tremble.
    The small mirrors are also broken beyond recognition,
    Who has the leisure to examine their white hair!
    Kneel down and surrender! Quickly reach out your hands,
    Alas! You should have learned some Chinese earlier!
    The beautiful MacArthur mansion looked very chaotic,
    The junior generals were either arguing or complaining;
    Was it a military meeting or a smoking contest?
    Only cigarette butts covered the living room.
    "Syngman Rhee's damned troops are too useless!"
    "The intelligence officers are all freeloaders!"
    MacArthur slammed the table and shouted loudly,
    His pipe fell down and unfortunately hit the teacup.
    Sink, sink, sink down!
    Korea is a big mud pit,
    What's the use of blowing your beard and glaring,
    The general's "offensive" is completely bankrupt!

    麦克阿瑟的“攻势”
    沙鸥   诗
       方成  画
    麦克阿瑟还来不及吃早点，
    就急忙忙飞到了清川江前线，
    刚刚天亮呢，雪风刮得紧，
    冻得他把大衣领子往上翻。
    他想指挥出一个“奇迹”，
    将军的心上真有把“虎头钳”：
    从西北、从东北压缩并合拢，
    一伸手就像摸着了鸭绿江边。
    将军很满意自己的谋略，
    深信这一下就会把局面扭转；
    他趾高气扬地又吹一个大牛，
    说“圣诞节”定可以大功圆满。
    “圣诞节”可以回家去，
    美国兵好像也有一点喜欢；
    虽然“感恩节”是早就过去了，
    那张支票兑换来的只是心惊胆寒！
    但有的美国兵还是写了家信，
    要妻子早准备过圣诞的晚餐；
    有的也写信给他国内的朋友，
    说过了“圣诞节”就不必再挂念。
    躲在“北极睡袋”里的美国兵，
    也把脑袋伸向了外边，
    感慨地说出还是家里好，
    家里到底比睡袋要温暖。
    那些拿着小镜子的顾问们，
    也欢欢喜喜地细眯着眼，
    心想白头发将停止生长，
    决定染了发才回家把老婆见。
    菲律宾的那一营挨冻的军队，
    也悄悄地议论了一番，
    轻声说出受“歧视”也不要紧，
    只要在“圣诞节”能离开朝鲜。
    李承晚更是把口水流了三尺长，
    只乐得他把尾巴甩的圆又圆，
    他暗想大好江山会稳稳坐定，
    心眼里感谢美国爸爸恩重如山。
    麦克阿瑟“视察”过了鸭绿江，
    才叨着烟斗回到东京的公馆，
    他简直有点得意忘形了，
    竟抱住日本舞女嘻哈了半天……
    开吹吧！他的“总部”发表了“公报”，
    又用“美国之音”哇哇地乱喊，
    真不怕吹走了房顶吹破了墙，
    你看他挺着脖子站在地图前。
    噼噼叭叭一声令下“总攻击”，
    但美国兵的自信却差一点，
    好像一个人穿过黄昏的寒村，
    都打着哆嗦，不敢?一眼。
    那知刚过一天就是霹雷一声响，
    哗啦啦打得天昏又地暗，
    人民军队排山倒海地杀来，
    真像天兵天将下了凡！
    只听见枪弹如急雨，
    轰??的炮声震裂了天，
    这里有了缺口，堵不住哟！
    那里的后路又被切断！
    美军战线成了一把粗糙的木锯了，
    糟透喽！这个兵团又被打烂，
    我的天，那个师又是“情况不明”，
    蠢猪！你还不往后窜！
    丢了枪不要紧，不要紧，
    只要性命得保全！
    怪老娘少生了两条腿，
    又简直不知那个方向最保险！
    “局势严重！局势严重！”
    麦克阿瑟气青了脸，
    将军的威风哪里去了？
    他的烟斗也冒不出烟。
    “退，退，退——”
    “攻势”变成了碰上石头的鸡蛋，
    死伤了多少，谁还有心来算，
    凉水浇背心，将军满脸冷汗。
    他一会儿拿着烟斗踱来踱去，
    一会儿他又坐在写字台前，
    两道眉毛不声不响地连在一起，
    他的亮皮靴重重地踏着地毯……
    “圣诞节回家”又成了肥皂泡，
    颜色虽好，可惜破得太快一点！
    没关系，还有一个“复活节”呢，
    也罢！明年过了还有后年！
    你看，美国兵真跑得精疲力尽，
    秩序已不值一个臭铜钱，
    请不必问什么叫“士气”，
    比严寒天的水银柱还低得远！
    喊爹喊妈没一声答应，
    一见刺刀，就心跳得像擂鼓一般，
    三四人一堆，二三十人一团，
    有的吓傻了，有的屁股朝天！
    “北极睡袋”早顾不得了，
    真糟！夜晚怎么办？
    鼻子上结冰倒是小事情，
    一声枪响只有两腿打颤。
    小镜子也破得不成样子，
    那还有闲心来把白头发细看！
    跪下投降吧！快伸出手，
    唉！早该把中国话学会一点！
    漂亮的麦公馆显得十分混乱，
    小将军们有的吵吵有的埋怨；
    是军事会议还是抽烟比赛呢？
    只见烟头把客厅都铺遍。
    “李承晚的浑蛋军队太不中用！”
    “情报人员也全是白吃饭！”
    麦克阿瑟拍桌子大喊大闹，
    他的烟斗掉下来不幸打中了茶碗。
    陷下去，陷下去！
    朝鲜是一个大泥潭，
    吹胡子瞪眼管个屁用，
    将军的“攻势”完全破产！
