Xinhua News Agency. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Customs have jointly promulgated the Measures for Customs to Collect Tonnage Tax, notifying local customs and tax bureaus to implement them from January 1, 1951. The full text of the measures is as follows:

Regarding the Interim Regulations on Ship Dues (Tonnage Tax) and Usage License Tax (including tonnage tax), the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the "Instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on Unifying Navigation and Port Management (Finance and Economics Plan (Traffic) No. 3316)," drafted a draft proposal and submitted it to the Government Administration Council for review. Before its promulgation, in order not to affect the collection of tonnage tax, the following joint notice is hereby issued:

1.  From January 1, 1951, the original ship dues (tonnage tax) collected by the Customs shall be incorporated into the scope of the usage license tax. All domestic ships that originally paid ship dues shall be changed to usage license tax by the tax authorities. However, foreign ships and Chinese ships leased by foreign merchants shall still be subject to tonnage tax, except for those exempted from tax as stipulated in Article 8, and shall be collected by the Customs on behalf of the tax authorities (ships that have already paid ship dues before January 1 shall be collected again when the validity period expires).

2.  The tonnage tax rates and calculation standards are as follows:

	Motor Vessels		Non-Motor Vessels
	Steamships	Tugboats	Various Manually Operated Boats and Barges	Sailing Ships

	5		5		1		3

	5000 yuan	10,000 yuan	30,000 yuan	50,000 yuan

Calculated based on net tonnage.

If the above tax rates are changed, the General Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government will notify the General Administration of Customs at any time.

3.  All ships subject to tonnage tax must, upon arrival at the port and when declaring import according to Customs regulations, simultaneously fill in a tonnage tax declaration form and apply for tax payment. The tax payment time shall be within five days from the day following the issuance of the "Tonnage Tax Payment Order" by the Customs, and the tonnage tax license shall be obtained upon payment.

4.  The procedures for paying tonnage tax and Customs collection on behalf of the tax authorities shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:

	(1) When a taxpayer declares tax to the Customs, they must present the ship's nationality certificate (or a certificate issued by the navigation authority proving that the certificate is stored) and a tonnage certificate.

	(2) The Customs shall, based on the documents in the preceding paragraph, verify the amount of tax payable by the ship and issue a tonnage tax payment order, which shall be handed over to the taxpayer to pay the tax at the local treasury or the Customs tax collection office (the receiving authority on the payment order shall be filled in as the local tax authority).

	(3) After receiving the payment, the treasury or the Customs tax collection office shall affix a receipt stamp on the tonnage tax payment order, retain the notification stub, send the receipt stub directly to the Customs for verification, and return the remaining stub and receipt to the taxpayer for submission to the Customs for review.

	(4) When the Customs receives the payment order and verifies that it is correct, it shall return the receipt stub of the payment order to the taxpayer and issue a tonnage tax license at the same time.

	(5) The Customs shall retain the stub of the tonnage tax payment order and send the receipt stub to the local competent tax authority on the day following the taxpayer's tax payment.

5.  The validity period of the ship tonnage tax license issued by the Customs shall be from the date of issuance of the tonnage tax license by the Customs until the end of three months, during which no further tax will be levied.

	The aforementioned tonnage tax license shall be printed by the General Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and issued by the Customs. (Before the new license is issued, the original license shall be used temporarily, with a stamp affixed indicating "Tonnage Tax Collected on Behalf of Tax Authorities.")

6.  For ships that have already paid tonnage tax and have one of the following circumstances, the Customs may, based on the supporting documents issued by the port authority, extend the listed validity period according to the number of days of the fault:

	(1) Ships that take refuge or undergo repairs for more than 30 days.

	(2) Ships that are quarantined due to epidemic prevention and cannot load or unload passengers or goods.

7.  All lighters, electric boats, barges, cargo ships, etc., owned or leased by foreign merchants that travel within the port shall be subject to tonnage tax collected by the Customs on behalf of the tax authorities from January 1. In addition, for foreign ships berthed in the port before the implementation of these measures, if the original ship dues have expired, the tonnage tax shall be collected on their behalf from the day following the expiration.

8.  The following ships shall be exempt from tax:

	(1) Ships owned and used by embassies, legations, and consulates of countries that have established diplomatic relations with our country.

	(2) Ships that have been certified by the local port authority and reported to the Customs for the record as having been stopped and dismantled.

	(3) Fixed floating docks, floating bridge docks, and floating ships owned by foreign merchants solely for loading and unloading passengers and goods and storing goods.

	(4) Ships that are permitted to be exempt from import declaration in accordance with Customs regulations.

9.  If the user of the ship completes the customs clearance procedures before the ship arrives at the port, they may pay the tonnage tax in advance; however, if the ship does not enter this port after paying the tonnage tax, the prepaid tax will not be refunded.

10. If the original net tonnage of a ship increases or decreases due to repairs, the tax amount shall be verified according to the tonnage certificate after the change in tonnage when declaring and paying the tonnage tax in the next period.

11. If the tonnage tax license obtained by the ship user is damaged or lost during the validity period, they may report to the Customs that originally issued the license to issue a duplicate of the tonnage tax license without paying additional tax; the word "duplicate" must be marked in red for identification.

12. If a ship that has already paid tonnage tax is sailing in another area and cannot present the tonnage tax license or its duplicate due to some reason, the Customs may order the ship user to pay a tonnage tax deposit and issue a license, which is valid from the date of issuance; this license must be marked in red with the words "Tonnage Tax Deposit License." If the ship user presents the original tonnage tax license or its duplicate to the Customs that originally issued the deposit license and applies for a refund within the validity period, the tonnage tax deposit paid shall be refunded in full.

13. If the ship user fails to declare and pay tax in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3, 4, and 7, in addition to being ordered to pay the full amount, a fine of up to three times the amount of tax payable shall be imposed. Furthermore, if the tax is not paid within five days (excluding Sundays and Customs holidays) from the day following the issuance of the collection payment order by the Customs, a late payment fee of 1% of the amount of tax payable shall be charged daily, all of which shall be enforced by the Customs. (This fine and late payment fee shall be handled in accordance with the procedures for remitting tonnage tax collected on behalf of tax authorities.)

14. All Customs bureaus shall, upon receiving this notice, immediately announce it to the public.
