Learning from Advanced Experience to Reform Various Tasks
	Zhengzhou Automobile Repair Plant Achieves Rapid Production Increase

[By our newspaper] The Zhengzhou Automobile Repair Plant of the Henan Province Highway Transportation Company overfulfilled its annual task by 111.2% in late October ahead of schedule. The quality of the plant's products has also improved significantly. Before the quota production in August, the vehicles repaired traveled 4,000 kilometers; now it has increased to 5,000 kilometers, and the highest record has been broken to 10,000 kilometers. The scrap rate of cylinder liners has been reduced from 50% to 20%.

The plant originally had very poor equipment and a chaotic system. The reason why it was able to achieve such results, like many factories and mines, is that the leading cadres worked hard to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and the Northeast, and unremittingly carried out a series of reforms based on the specific conditions of the plant. In March and April, in response to the chaotic system and unreasonable wages, they carefully changed the organization, rationally divided labor, and, after technical tests, formulated technical and wage standards, and relatively reasonably preliminarily assessed wages, so that production began to become regular, and the situation of low output and poor quality was improved. Subsequently, a "Red May" production competition was launched, and the monthly plan was overfulfilled by 124.7%. In June and July, the focus was on improving quality. In August and September, on the basis of the production competition, quota management was tried out, and labor productivity was further increased by 45%. For example, the repair of engines was reduced from 240 man-hours to 152 man-hours. In October, the competition was further expanded, surplus production was implemented with emphasis, various systems were clarified, and a production responsibility system was established step by step, strengthening business management, improving technology to ensure quality and ensure safety. The plant paid attention to implementing the spirit of democratic management in various tasks and brought into play the role of technical personnel. Over the past year, among the plant's 80-odd workers, a total of 14 people have been trained and promoted to deputy factory directors, deputy directors, deputy League branch secretaries, and other cadres.

    学习先进经验改革各种工作
    郑州汽车修配厂生产迅速提高
    【本报讯】河南省公路运输公司郑州汽车修配厂于十月底提前超额完成全年任务的百分之一百一十一点二。该厂产品质量亦显著提高，在八月份定额生产前，修理车辆行驶为四千公里，现已提高到五千公里，最高纪录并已打破一万公里；汽缸筒废品率已由百分之五十降低到百分之二十。
    该厂原来设备极差，制度混乱，所以能得到这样的成绩，正像很多厂、矿一样，是由于领导干部努力学习苏联以及东北的先进经验，根据本厂的具体情况，不懈地进行了一系列的改革工作。在三、四月份，他们针对制度混乱、工资不合理等情况，慎重地改变组织，合理分工，经过技术测验，订立了技术及工资标准，比较合理地初步评订了工资，因而使生产开始走上正规，产量低下及质量恶劣的情况得到改进。接着，开展了红五月生产竞赛，全月计划超额完成百分之一百二十四点七。六、七月份则集中提高质量。八、九月份，又在生产竞赛的基础上，试行定额管理，劳动生产率又进一步提高百分之四十五，如修理引擎，由二四○工时缩减到一五二工时。十月份，进一步扩大竞赛，有重点地实行超额生产，明确各种制度，并有步骤地建立生产责任制，加强经营管理，提高技术以保证质量、保证安全等。该厂在各种工作上注意了贯彻民主管理的精神，发挥了技术人员的作用。一年来，全厂八十余工人中，计培养与提拔副厂长、副主任、副团支书及其他干部共十四人。
