Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: In response to the demands from industry and commerce representatives at the Second National Tax Conference for unified tax policy and legal interpretations, and following suggestions to publish a tax gazette, the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance issued the "Measures for Unifying Tax Policy and Legal Interpretations and Publishing the Central Tax Gazette" on December 9th, tasking the General Taxation Bureau with its implementation. The main points of the measures are as follows:

    All new national tax policy matters will be handled by the General Taxation Bureau, which will draft interpretation opinions. These will be unified and issued as interpretation precedents by the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance, so that local tax bureaus can follow them. Those requiring interpretation by the Central People's Government Government Administration Council will be forwarded to the Government Administration Council for interpretation. All centrally interpreted precedents will be published in full in the Central Tax Gazette; when necessary, they will also be published in local newspapers. The Central Tax Gazette will be edited and published by the General Taxation Bureau as a semi-monthly publication, published on the 1st and 16th of each month. Its contents will include: (1) National tax revenue policies and laws; (2) Interpretation precedents of various tax laws, regulations, and detailed rules; (3) Inquiries and answers on general tax issues; (4) Typical cases of taxpayers and tax workers; (5) Other relevant articles or special treatises on finance and taxation.

    After receiving the aforementioned notice, the General Taxation Bureau has been actively preparing for the publication of the Central Tax Gazette and has decided to launch it on New Year's Day, 1951. All distribution work for the gazette has been entrusted to local post offices.

    中央人民政府财政部颁发办法
    统一税政法令解释与发行税务公报
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府财政部根据出席二届全国税务会议的工商界代表提出的统一税政法令解释的要求和发刊税务公报的建议，于十二月九日颁发“统一税政法令解释与发行中央税务公报办法”，责成税务总局办理。该办法要点如下：
    凡属全国性的税政新事例，统由税务总局拟具解释意见，由中央人民政府财政部统一发出解释例案，以便各地税务局遵照执行。其须经中央人民政府政务院解释者，再转请政务院解释之。凡属地方性的税政新事例，各地税务机关得迳行解释，并逐旬层报税务总局备查。凡属中央解释之例案，全部分期刊载于中央税务公报；必要时并在各地报纸刊布。中央税务公报，由税务总局负责编辑出版，定为半月刊，每月一日与十六日出版。其内容为：（一）国家税收政策法令。（二）各种税法条例、细则的解释例案。（三）一般税务问题之询问与答复。（四）纳税义务人与税工人员的典型事例。（五）其他有关财政税收的论著或专论。
    税务总局接到前项通知后，已积极筹备中央税务公报的出版工作，并决定于一九五一年元旦日创刊。该公报的一切发行工作已委托各地邮局代办。
