Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Railway workers across the country are actively donating money, writing letters, and sending 慰问袋 (comfort bags) to express their regards to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. As of December 10th, railway workers in Beijing, Baoding, Nankou, Fengtai, Hengyang, Taiyuan, and the Jinzhou area of Northeast China have made 3,695 comfort bags, written 2,916 letters, and donated over 16 million yuan in comfort funds. The comfort bags are filled with items such as towels, soap, pens, diaries, masks, and goggles. After collective discussion, the sanitation workers at Beijing Station decided to buy pig oil soap for the soldiers, saying, "Using pig oil soap in winter will not only remove dirt but also protect their faces, so they can be energized to fight the American bandits." Driver Wu Hongxun put a set of envelopes and stationery in the comfort bag, writing his address and name on the envelope and adding, "Please tell us about even greater victories!" Wang Guirong, a female staff member of the Tianjin Public Security Office, embroidered on the comfort bag: "Chase closely, don't let a single enemy escape!"

The letters of sympathy written by the railway workers are overflowing with enthusiasm and friendship. Gu Shiyu, a worker at the Beijing Machinery Repair Factory, wrote in his letter: "I am giving you a piece of rubber, relying on your strength to erase the humiliation suffered by our two countries, China and Korea, from imperialism over the years; a pencil and a notebook, please write a glorious new page of victory for the people of China and Korea." The letter from all the workers of the Beijing Public Works Section wrote: "This is a small token of our appreciation. Use the towel to wipe away your sweat so you can pursue the enemy, and use the soap to wash away the enemy's blood that splashed on you!" Fu Tingyuan, head of the Taiyuan Public Security Section, and Li Fengge, a section chief, who were wounded during the eight-year War of Resistance and the four-year Self-Defense Liberation War and transferred to work on the railway, wrote: "The American imperialists' repeated provocations have reignited the anger in our hearts. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's assistance to Korea represents our will. Although I have been wounded, I am confident that I can still kill the enemy. I declare to the people of the whole country: If the motherland needs me, I am ready to return to the battlefield at any time." Li Yong, the veteran hero and driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, wrote to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "In order to support you, we are launching patriotic production competitions in the rear. Our railway workers have launched the 'Over-Axle Movement' to haul more, run faster, and avoid accidents. Our Mao Zedong locomotive exceeded its axle load by more than 3,000 tons in November (exceeding the axle load means hauling more cars). We are using these practical actions to support you. Comrades, advance victoriously! All the people of China firmly support you."

    全国铁路职工            
    热烈写信送慰问袋
    【新华社十五日讯】全国铁路职工纷纷献金、写信、送慰问袋慰问我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。北京、保定、南口、丰台、衡阳、太原和东北的锦州地区铁路职工，截至本月十日止已做了三千六百九十五个慰问袋，写了二千九百一十六封信，献出慰问金一千六百多万元。慰问袋中装满毛巾、肥皂、钢笔、日记本、口罩、风镜等物。北京站清扫工友经过集体研究之后，决定给战士们买猪油胰子，他们说：“使猪油胰子冬天去泥还不疝脸，好振起精神来打美国强盗。”司机吴宏勋在慰问袋里装进一套信封和信纸，信封上写下了自己的地址和姓名，并且写着：“请求你们把更大的胜利消息告诉我们！”天津公安处女工作人员王桂荣在慰问袋上绣上：“紧追，别叫一个敌人跑掉！”
    铁路工人们所写的慰问信洋溢着热情和友爱。北京修械厂工人顾时雨的慰问信里写着：“我赠送你们橡皮一块，靠你们的力量把我们中朝两国历年来受帝国主义的耻辱擦干净，铅笔一枝、笔记本一个，请你们给中朝人民写上胜利的光荣的一页新历史。”北京工务段工区全体工人的信上写着：“这是我们一点心意，用毛巾擦干你们的汗水，好去追击敌人，用肥皂洗净溅在你们身上的敌人的血腥！”经过八年抗战、四年自卫解放战争因而负伤转到铁路上工作的太原公安段段长傅廷远、股长李凤格写信说：“美帝一再挑衅使我重新燃起了心头的怒火，中国人民志愿部队的援助朝鲜正代表了我们的意志，我虽然负过伤，但自信还可杀敌，我向全国人民表示：祖国需要时，我随时等待重上战场。”毛泽东号机车司机长老英雄李永写信给我国人民志愿军说：“我们为了支援你们，在后方都展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，我们铁路工人展开了超轴运动，要多拉快跑不出事故，我们毛泽东号机车十一月份共超轴三千多吨（超轴就是多拉车）。我们拿这些实际行动来支援你们。同志们，胜利前进吧，我们全中国的人民都坚决地支援你们。”
