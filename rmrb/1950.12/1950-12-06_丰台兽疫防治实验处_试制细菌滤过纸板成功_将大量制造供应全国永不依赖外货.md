    Fengtai Veterinary Disease Prevention Experimental Station
    Successfully Trial-Manufactures Bacterial Filter Paperboard
    Will Mass-Produce and Supply Nationwide, Never Relying on Foreign Goods Again
    [Reported by this newspaper] Ji Guangbin, a technician at the Fengtai Veterinary Disease Prevention Experimental Station, and others have successfully trial-manufactured bacterial filter paperboard, ensuring that the production of various serum vaccines will no longer be affected by a shortage of foreign goods. Various serums and tetanus toxoids, etc., must be filtered through a bacterial filter to remove unwanted bacteria and impurities during the manufacturing process. Manufacturing agencies generally use various types of Seitz filters for filtration. The filter paperboard used in this type of filter has always been purchased from European and American countries, which is not only expensive but also difficult to obtain. Moreover, since the quantity used is quite large, it has added considerable difficulties to various manufacturing agencies. Due to the increasing development of its business, the Fengtai Veterinary Disease Prevention Experimental Station needed more filter paperboard, but the original quantity was very small, which affected the manufacturing work. In order to overcome this difficulty and ensure the supply of serum vaccines, Ji Guangbin, a technician at the station, and technicians Zhao Shuying and Liao Zhi, etc., under the encouragement and help of leading cadres, brainstormed ideas and, after more than two months of meticulous research and numerous experiments, successfully created a type of filter paperboard. The trial filtration results were good. Several pieces have now been produced and distributed to various manufacturing and research agencies for trial use. If the results are good, they will be mass-produced and supplied nationwide, never using foreign goods again. (Zhao Qingsen)

    丰台兽疫防治实验处
    试制细菌滤过纸板成功
    将大量制造供应全国永不依赖外货
    【本报讯】丰台兽疫防治实验处技师姬广斌等试制细菌滤过纸板成功，保证各种血清疫苗的制造不再因外货缺少而受到影响。各种血清和破伤风类毒素等在制造过程中必须经过细菌滤过器滤除不需要之菌体和杂质。各制造机关滤过时一般都用各型的塞氏滤过器。这种滤过器所用的滤过纸板，向来靠由欧美各国购买、价钱既贵，购买也不容易，更因用的数量也相当大，因此给各制造机关增加了不少的困难。丰台兽疫防治实验处因业务日渐开展，需要滤过纸板增多，但原有数量很少，因此影响了制造工作。为了克服这一困难，保证血清疫苗的供应，该处技师姬广斌、技工赵淑英、廖志等，曾在领导干部的鼓励和帮助下，大家出主意、想办法，经两月多的精心研究和多次试验曾创制成功一种滤过纸板，试滤结果尚好。现已制出若干片分送各制造研究机关试用，如效果良好，即将大量制造供给全国，永不再用外国货。（赵庆森）
