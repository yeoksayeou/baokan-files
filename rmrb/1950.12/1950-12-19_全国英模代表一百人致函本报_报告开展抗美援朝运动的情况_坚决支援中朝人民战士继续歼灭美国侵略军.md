[This Newspaper] News - One hundred hero model representatives attending the National Hero Model Representative Conference sent a letter to this newspaper, reporting on their work in-depth in various troops, factories, and villages to drive the masses to actively work and produce, and to carry out the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-the-Homeland Movement. Combat heroes from the troops said in their letters that they have already conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions on strengthening national defense forces to the troops, and have launched a wave of building national defense in the troops in preparation for attacking the American aggressors. For example, Hu Huaizhi, a reconnaissance hero from a certain unit in East China, after returning to a certain coastal defense line, conveyed the spirit of the conference to the soldiers of the unit, and spoke about the crimes of the U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression, undermining the UN Charter, and destroying peace, igniting the flames of anger in the soldiers. Hu Huaizhi said in his letter that he is now standing on the national defense line with the soldiers, defending the national defense, and taking the lead in building national defense. Industrial labor models in factories reported that they are continuously driving the masses to complete the over-quota tasks of patriotic production. For example, Ma Liuhai, a national industrial labor model representative from the Baitong Mine in Datong, since the launch of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement, the efficiency of coal mining has increased from 1.6 tons per worker in mid-October to 3.7 tons. At the same time, the "layered retreat" new coal mining method jointly researched by him and his partners Lian Wanlu and Wang Shangyu has now been extended to four mining areas. Pu Rongchen, a labor model from the Shanghai Post Office, created a "multi-denomination postage meter" in the patriotic competition to Resist America and Aid Korea. This machine can carry out the work of stamping, distinguishing between local and out-of-town ordinary letters, registered letters, express letters, and other twelve kinds of letters, which is twelve times more efficient than the "simple denomination postage meter" he created in April. Militia heroes and agricultural labor models, in addition to taking the lead in production in the countryside, have become powerful assistants to the rural democratic regime. They widely carried out current affairs propaganda on Resist America and Aid Korea, and effectively打击和镇压打击和镇压 suppressed the rumors and sabotage activities of bandits and special agents. For example, Hao Qingshan, a militia hero from Haobaitu Village in Ding County, Hebei Province, immediately launched propaganda on Resist America and Aid Korea after returning to the village. Under his propaganda and mobilization, militia captain Hao Sihai reviewed his past paralysis thoughts at a meeting of the whole village, actively rectified the militia, and stepped up the suppression of special agents and bandits. He also promoted 15 production teams in the village to launch a production competition to Resist America and Aid Korea. Wu Chonghua, an agricultural labor model from Tianlou Village, Fifth District, Juancheng County, automatically led the masses of various villages in the district to block river ditches when the Yellow River water rose in late October, so that the district was flooded with more than 11,000 mu of wheat. He won the support of the people of various villages. In addition, he also led the masses of the village to pad the soil and build dikes, obtaining more than 16,000 jin of wages in rice, so that the masses of the whole village can survive the famine this winter and next spring. Agricultural labor model Jia Lanhu said in his letter: "Since our work team came to Hehe Village, Xingtang County, to promote autumn afforestation work, we have been steadily carrying out the afforestation movement to eliminate desertification with the masses on the Shendao Beach desert. We have now built 72,000 holes for windbreak forest networks. We want to express our determination to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions of afforestation. We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialism that China's beautiful rivers and mountains are not allowed to be tainted by you!" The hero models unanimously despised the American aggressors, showed a strong confidence in defeating the American aggressors, and firmly supported the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist America and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army to continue annihilating the American aggressors.
