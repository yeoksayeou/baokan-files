Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 18th—Comprehensive report from TASS, Moscow, December 17th: Following the Soviet government's note of November 3rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, proposing a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement to eradicate German militarism, it further delivered notes of largely identical content to the British and French governments on December 15th through the British and French Ambassadors to Moscow, respectively.

The note first pointed out: "In the past few months, the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and certain other countries have been engaged in negotiations regarding West Germany and its army's participation in the Western European and North Atlantic nation blocs." "The foreign ministers and their assistants, as well as defense ministers and chiefs of staff of the aforementioned countries, have held a series of meetings for this purpose." The British and French governments, along with other governments, "have agreed to restore the German army in West Germany, dispatch Hitler's generals and officers to this army, and agree to measures for the restoration of war industries, including the Ruhr war industries that have repeatedly become the basis of German militarism. The details of this agreement are now being discussed. Among the many issues discussed is the question of establishing the general size of the West German army. It is known from published reports that the West German army will account for one-fifth of all armed forces of the North Atlantic nation bloc, which will give the West German army an absolute advantage in the armed forces of future Western European countries. At the same time, the strength of German divisions and brigades, as well as supplying them with heavy weapons, including tanks, and other specific issues regarding the restoration of the German army are being discussed. It is well known that the likes of Adenauer and Schumacher have openly opposed the Potsdam decision on eradicating German militarism; and, under the pretext of equal rights with other member states of the North Atlantic bloc, are demanding all kinds of heavy weapons for the West German army and the restoration of West German war industries; shamelessly talking about preparing for a new war in Europe."

The note pointed out: The above materials prove that the British and French governments, along with other governments, "are preparing to directly conclude a military alliance with the West German Adenauer government. This situation poses a serious threat to peace and revives German militarism. This is something that the Soviet Union and the people of European countries who suffered German aggression and long-term occupation in the First and Second World Wars cannot tolerate."

The Soviet government then pointed out in the notes to the British and French governments, respectively: The position of the British and French governments not only violates the Potsdam Agreement on eradicating German militarism, but also clearly contradicts the Anglo-Soviet "Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and Its Associates in Europe and of Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter" signed on May 26, 1942, and the "Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance Between the Soviet Union and the French Republic" signed on December 10, 1944. Article 3, Section 2 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty stipulates that the contracting parties "will take all measures in their power after the termination of the war to render impossible a renewal of aggression and violation of the peace by Germany or any of the states associated with her in acts of aggression in Europe."

Article 3 of the Franco-Soviet treaty states: "The contracting parties undertake to take jointly, at the end of the present war against Germany, all necessary steps to eliminate any new threat coming from Germany and to prevent any action capable of enabling her to attempt any new aggression." After quoting the above article, the Soviet note declared: "The restoration of the West German army led by Hitler's generals, which is now being prepared, will create the revival of German militarism, inevitably leading to new attempts at aggression by Germany, which Germany's neighbors and other peace-loving countries in Europe cannot but consider."

The note then solemnly pointed out, after respectively listing Article 5 of the Franco-Soviet treaty and Article 7 of the Anglo-Soviet treaty, which stipulate that "the contracting parties undertake to enter into no alliance and to take part in no coalition directed against the other High Contracting Party": the British and French governments, disregarding the provisions of the above treaties, have participated in the so-called Western Union and the North Atlantic nation bloc, which are directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and have included West Germany, headed by the revanchist Adenauer, in the Western Union and the North Atlantic bloc. This attitude is clearly inconsistent with the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet treaty, and undermines the foundation and meaning of the treaties.

The Soviet government finally stated specifically in the note: The British and French governments "shall bear full responsibility for the situation that has been created."

    苏联政府分别照会英法政府
    指责两国阴谋重新武装西德
    英法政府此种行为显然破坏了英苏条约与法苏条约的基础，应对业已造成的情势负全部责任。
    【新华社十八日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：苏联政府自十一月三日照会美、英、法三国政府建议召开四国外长会议讨论履行波茨坦协定以肃清德国军国主义以后，又于十二月十五日分别经由英法两国驻莫斯科大使向英法两国政府递交内容大致相同的照会各一件。
    照会首先指出：“在过去数月中，英国、法国、美国政府以及某些其他国家政府曾经进行关于西德及其军队参加西欧和北大西洋国家集团的谈判”，“上述各国的外交部长及其助理、以及国防部长和参谋长为此曾举行了一连串的会议。”英法两国政府与其他各国政府“已经同意恢复西德的德国军队，派遣希特勒的将领和军官到这支军队中去，并且同意恢复战争工业的措施，包括曾经一再成为德国军国主义之基础的鲁尔战争工业在内。现在已经转而讨论这个协定的细节。所讨论的，除了其他许多问题外，有确立西德陆军的一般数目问题。由己经公布的消息可以知道，西德陆军将为北大西洋国家集团所有武装部队的五分之一，这将会使西德陆军在未来西欧国家的武装部队中占绝对优势。同时，德国师和旅的兵力，以及供应他们以包括坦克在内的重武器，关于恢复德国陆军的其他具体问题都正在讨论中。众所周知，阿登纳、舒马赫之流已经公然反对波茨坦关于肃清德国军国主义的决定；并且以与北大西洋集团其他成员国权利平等为借口，为西德陆军要求一切种类的重武器和恢复西德战争工业；恬不知耻地谈论在欧洲准备新的战争。”
    照会指出：上引材料证明，英法两国政府与其他各国政府“准备与西德阿登纳政府直接缔结军事联盟。这种情况造成了对和平的严重威胁，使德国军国主义复活。这是苏联以及曾经在第一次和第二次世界大战中遭受德国侵略与长期占领的欧洲各国人民所不能听任的。”
    苏联政府接着在致英法两国政府的照会中分别指出：英法两国政府的这种立场，不仅违反关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定，并且显然抵触一九四二年五月二十六日签订的英苏“战时联盟反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国并在战后合作互助条约”和一九四四年十二月十日签订的“苏联与法兰西共和国同盟互助条约”。英苏条约的第三条第二款规定，缔约双方“在战争结束后，将采取他们力所能及的一切措施，以使德国或任何其他与之勾结从事侵略欧洲的行为的国家不可能再事侵略与破坏和平。”
    法苏条约的第三条称：“缔约双方并约定，在目前对德战争结束以后，联合采取一切必要步骤，以消除来自德国的任何新威胁，并防止使德国可能从事任何新的侵略企图的那种行动。”苏联照会在引用上项条文后宣称：“现在正在准备的由希特勒将领统率的西德军队之恢复，将造成德国军国主义的复活，使德国不可避免地企图作新的侵略，德国各邻国与欧洲其他爱好和平的国家对此不能不加以考虑。”
    照会然后在分别列举规定“缔约双方约定不缔结或参加反对缔约国另一方的任何同盟或联合”的法苏条约第五条与英苏条约第七条后，郑重指出：英法两国已不顾上项条约规定而参加了反对苏联及其他爱好和平国家的所谓西方联盟与北大西洋国家集团，并把以复仇主义者阿登纳为首的西德包括在西方联盟以及北大西洋集团之内。这种态度显然与英苏条约以及法苏条约不相符合，并破坏了条约的基础与意义。
    苏联政府最后在照会中特别声明：英法两国政府“应对业已造成的情势负全部责任”。
