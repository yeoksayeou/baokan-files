Xinhua News Agency report: The cold weather clothing donation drive in the Northeast region has now basically concluded. The entire region collected over 140 billion Northeast currency in cash for cold weather clothing, over 38 million sets of cotton clothing, and a portion of grain.

During the donation drive, workers, farmers, and businesspeople in various parts of Northeast China fully demonstrated their deep concern for the disaster-stricken people and enthusiastically donated. The people of Harbin City collected over 20 billion yuan in cash and over 6,700 pieces of clothing. Anshan City combined the donation with in-depth propaganda against American imperialist aggression, making citizens realize that the crimes of American imperialism are the main cause of the disaster. This aroused the citizens' anti-American sentiment and their sympathy and concern for the disaster-stricken people, and they donated generously. The city has now collected over 10,000 sets of cold weather clothing, exceeding the original plan by 40 percent. The donation enthusiasm of the employees of the state-owned "41" factory in Benxi City was even more enthusiastic. In addition to donating his new cotton-padded clothes to the disaster-stricken people, worker Wang Youqin also donated a set of single-layer clothes and 250,000 yuan in cash. Technician Li Taixian also donated all 5.8 million yuan he won for improving the pot-making technique to the disaster-stricken people. In addition, cities such as Shenyang and Dalian have also completed or are close to completing the task of soliciting cold weather clothing.

Beijing News Agency report: The work of all sectors of Beijing to solicit cold weather clothing to aid disaster victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan began in early October and successfully concluded at the end of November. As of the end of November, a total of 197,367 pieces of various clothing and 2,355,255,699 yuan in cash for cold weather clothing were collected, totaling 117,581 sets of cold weather clothing. On average, one set of cold weather clothing was donated for every seventeen people in the city, exceeding the original plan of collecting 100,000 sets of cold weather clothing. All the clothes have now been converted into cold weather clothing and allocated to northern Anhui and Hebei, with 60,136 sets going to northern Anhui and 10,394 sets going to Hebei. All the cash has been handed over to the Cold Weather Clothing Donation Headquarters for remittance to the disaster areas. In addition, 83,574 items such as shoes, hats, and socks have also been sent to the disaster areas, and 801 other items have been sent, of which 585 have been allocated to disaster victims from Hebei Province in Beijing, and the remaining 216 have been handed over to the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau for continued distribution to disaster victims in Beijing.

This donation work was carried out on the basis of the conscious and voluntary spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity among the people, and the tendencies of egalitarianism and forced donation were promptly overcome. At the same time, it closely relied on the organizational strength of various government organs, organizations, and democratic parties, which not only widely mobilized people from all walks of life, but also avoided the phenomenon of repeated solicitations that might have occurred. Under the leadership of the district people's representative conference consultative committees, the districts widely absorbed enthusiastic people from all walks of life who are devoted to relief work to participate in the donation work. Under the leadership of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, the literary and art circles actively participated in the publicity and donation work, and jointly performed 33 benefit performances. The city's 21 cinemas also jointly performed two benefit performances. In order to thank people from all walks of life for their enthusiastic charitable acts in helping disaster victims, the Beijing Cold Weather Clothing Donation Branch has prepared 600 commemorative certificates, which will be distributed to various government organs, organizations, outstanding donation teams, and enthusiastic people.
