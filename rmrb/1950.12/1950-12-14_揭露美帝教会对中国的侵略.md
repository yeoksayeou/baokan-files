Exposing the American Imperialist Church's Aggression Against China
·Bǐ Yǐng·
American warmonger Dulles, at the UN Political Committee on November 27, flaunted America's "friendship" with China, talking volubly about his church, saying: "Our relationship with China is mainly based on a long background of religious, cultural, and humanitarian ties. This relationship was started by missionaries. My church has been sending missionaries to China for about 150 years. I think every area in the United States—no matter how big—has churches that have sent missionaries to China for many years; in every area, during major Christian holidays, during Christmas and Easter, people gather together and prepare packages to send to their missionaries in China to distribute to the Chinese people." He also said: "Throughout history, the United States has always been a steadfast friend of China, and we have used every means to maintain China's political integrity and territorial integrity, to enhance China's happiness, and to aid China in cultural and humanitarian endeavors." Dulles spoke too late, because the imperialistic aggressiveness of the church's work, in the concrete resistance of the Boxers and the national awakening of the Chinese people after the May Fourth Movement, had already revealed the hypocrisy of this deceptive propaganda. However, imperialism is good at deceptive propaganda, so Chairman Mao said in his telegram to the Tianjin business community: "American imperialists have done a lot of deceptive propaganda to the Chinese people, and all patriots should not believe these deceptive remarks." We will never believe these deceptive remarks, but we still need to expose these deceptive remarks in front of the Chinese people.

Let's now open the packages that the American church "distributed to the Chinese people" during Christmas or Easter, and see what exactly is wrapped inside.

The Sino-American Tianjin Treaty of 1858 stipulated: "...hereafter all law-abiding missionaries and those who practice the religion shall be treated with compassion and protection, and shall not be deceived or abused, and no one shall disturb those who abide by the religious rules and practice in peace" (Article 29).

Before 1858 (and after 1858), the Chinese people had always given hate, anger and scorn to foreign missionaries and Chinese "church-eaters" for their acts of aggression and oppression. The so-called "religious cases" in Chinese history happened this way. The purpose of the American imperialists in Article 29 of the Tianjin Treaty was to use political pressure to obtain legal guarantees for missionary work, in order to open the way for the expansion of missionary work by the American imperialists. Anyone who thinks that Chinese people are natural believers in Catholicism and Christianity is completely wrong. Jesus Christ was sent in by imperialists with warships. China has its own national religion, and the Chinese people and government have never voluntarily invited American missionaries to China to preach. On the contrary, American missionaries, like missionaries from other countries, use the Bible as a cover while obeying the interests of capitalist imperialism, in order to establish a bridgehead for imperialist aggression; thus, they raised diplomatic treaties and rushed into China in large numbers.

"The methods used by missionaries to recruit followers were: first, to publicize foreign power and attract those who could not bear the oppression of officials or were invaded by other villages or clans to 'join the church'. These converts often relied on the church, the whole village or clan, relied on foreign forces to defend themselves or seek revenge, and seemed to consider themselves foreign subjects, breaking away from China. Second, to buy off the extremely poor to 'eat the church' with money. The price varied. Some said 'four taels of silver' (quoted by Wu Dezhi in *Chronicles of Chinese and Western Affairs*), some said 'give one hundred and thirty taels of silver' (Wei Yuan, *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms*), some said 'the missionaries carry a large amount of money in their pockets and buy off the ruffians among the Chinese people, refusing no one, always issuing money temporarily or regularly' (Roland Allen, *The Siege of the Peking Legations*). These church-eaters regarded 'church member' as a title (after the Boxer Rebellion, the Shandong bishop allowed church members to refrain from using the term church member when filing lawsuits, and the local officials would impartially investigate the truth), relying on foreign forces to extort the good, and engage in litigation, with more power than the old gentry. Third, to preach the gospel and gain the faith of some people. These people are truly 'believers', accounting for a very small number among the church members. In fact, the church is an aggressive group jointly composed of foreign missionaries, converts, and church-eaters." - Fan Wenlan, *A Concise History of Modern China*, Chapter 8.

American churches did distribute packages, such as the "four taels" or "one hundred and thirty taels" of silver mentioned above, which, in today's terms, would be several "U.S. dollars." However, this unequal treaty was only effective for the ruling class of the Manchu Dynasty, but it became worthless to the Chinese people. The Chinese people were not only not restricted by the treaty, but became more resentful of imperialist aggression and their anti-imperialist sentiments rose higher. In the forty-two years between 1858 and 1900, more than sixty religious cases occurred, spanning fifteen provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Taiwan, and finally the large-scale Boxer anti-imperialist movement broke out. Although the Boxers themselves had their own weaknesses, their essence was a peasant anti-imperialist movement, and in terms of its expression, it was an armed struggle by the Chinese national religion against foreign religions—Catholicism and Christianity. The imperialists took this opportunity to organize the Eight-Nation Alliance, invade Beijing, drive away the Qing government, and demand huge compensation. Coincidentally, the United States and its army, which boasted of "friendship" with the Chinese people, were one-eighth of this "alliance." Its price for participating in the "Alliance"'s great massacre was to receive 32.9 million taels of compensation. Now we fully understand that the "packages" distributed by American churches thus recovered such a large amount of bloody interest. It would be too naive to think that American missionaries are truly charitable givers. Fifty years later, if we still allow American imperialist Dulles to insult the Chinese people in this way, and think that Dulles's "package" is not bad, then that would be truly idiotic.

In this way, the number of foreign Catholic priests increased from more than 800 in 1900 to about 1,400 in 1910; the number of foreign Christian pastors increased from more than 3,800 in 1906 to about 5,200 in 1910. This is the direct result of the Boxer Rebellion being suppressed by imperialist arms and the Qing government betraying the Boxer Protocol.

Just two years after the Boxer Protocol, in 1903, the United States forced the Chinese government to sign the Sino-American Commercial Navigation Supplementary Treaty in Shanghai, which stipulated: "...American churches are allowed to rent and permanently lease houses and land foundations in various parts of China as church public property for missionary purposes..."

This completely illustrates that the imperialist instrument of aggression—the American church—urgently needed to seize a large amount of property and land in China as bases of aggression. It was not about distributing "packages" to the Chinese people as Dulles said, but rather the Chinese people offering a large piece of land to "Christ." Imperialists righteously colluded with the corrupt officials and feudal forces of the time in various places at extremely low prices, forcing people to transfer large amounts of fertile land, large plots of land, and tall buildings to the church through various means such as cheap sales, cheap mortgages, transfers, fines, dedications, rentals, and deceptions. To cite a few facts as examples:

As early as 1848, the American Episcopal Bishop of Shanghai, William Jones Boone, when the countries were dividing concessions in Shanghai, this bishop launched a conspiracy and, after negotiations, designated the area around Hongkou on the north bank of the Suzhou River, where his church was located, as its church area, which later became the American concession. In 1896, the American church in Dengzhou (Penglai), Shandong, forcibly occupied civilian houses, causing a religious case. In fact, American churches had used various methods to occupy a large amount of land and many houses throughout the country to build churches and build residences, and even rented out land and houses as landlords. The treaty of 1903 was merely a confirmation of this accomplished fact and gained an additional layer of treaty protection. Due to the signing of this treaty, the American church extended further into China's remote areas, such as Batang (i.e. Ba'an) in Xikang Province, which also had an American church. During the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the American pastor and doctor, Stevens, rented a large piece of land from the Batang County Government with a handling fee of several hundred yuan and built his own church, hospital, and school; in 1931, he even automatically expanded the wall and encroached on a large amount of land.

From these two examples, we can see the aggressive position gained by the American church in China as a result of using political pressure (the conclusion of treaties). Of course, here we do not need to list in detail the same situations that occurred in the past when Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other countries used the same methods to obtain missionary privileges from China. Since the American imperialists imposed the open-door policy of "most favored nation" on China, whatever privileges Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other countries obtained in missionary work at that time, the American imperialists shared a portion of them. Therefore, Acheson's "total diplomacy" speech on February 16 this year also admitted the correctness of the proposition that "the progress of imperialism is often that first, missionaries are sent out, then merchants, and then colonial governors." Bridgman, the earliest American missionary sent to China, said: "Those who come to China to preach are more for political reasons than religious reasons." Bridgman personally provided powerful intelligence to the American government for the conclusion of the Sino-American Treaty of Wanghia, promoting the establishment of the treaty. Through the church, what the Chinese people received was a "package," but what was given to the United States was national sovereignty. Jesus, commodities, and cannons were the entire set of tools for European and American imperialists to invade China. Christianity disguised itself with a charitable face, and the cannons were grimly opening China. The overall goal was to dump commodities, plunder raw materials, and then send a governor, which is the essence of imperialist aggression. The reason why Dulles exaggerated the "friendship" of missionaries is precisely because he is always mindful of this effective tool of aggression.

On the other hand, these missionaries, having been in China for a long time, call themselves "China hands." They not only collected intelligence for their own government, but also extensively carried out malicious propaganda about China's situation in their own country. The Chinese in the eyes of Europeans and Americans are those with bound feet, queues, and opium. This concept has not been completely changed even today. These missionaries have made some "contributions." Only by saying that China is extremely bad, extremely poor, and extremely terrible can they use the name of Jesus to beg for money from those old foreign women to express "friendship" in China.

The church, as a tool of the aggressor, exists as a direct espionage agency. It not only understands all aspects of China's situation, collects various intelligence, and assists the political actions of imperialists, but also develops direct contact with reactionary armed forces and massacres the Chinese people. American imperialists closely collude with the Vatican and use local Catholics for such espionage work. Before 1947, the Catholic Church in Zhangjiazhuang, Xian County, under the command of American intelligence personnel stationed in Nanjing, Maud, colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit reactionary army to attack the liberated areas and directed American planes to bomb targets. This has already been documented. Recently, American imperialists, through the reactionary elements of the Catholic Church in Korea stationed by the Vatican, have been carrying out espionage activities. A joint intelligence center station between the United States and the Vatican has been established, responsible for directing and deploying espionage activities in Korea and mainland China. Therefore, Willoughby, the head of American intelligence in Japan, praised the Vatican's "service" spirit and especially praised the church headed by Bowen, stationed in Seoul by the Pope, because this church regularly provided military and bombing target intelligence. Eighty percent of the Vatican's funding comes from American imperialists, so the Vatican deserves to exert great effort in this regard for the American imperialists. Thinking that the United States is all Protestant, and Catholicism belongs to countries such as France and Italy, and that the Vatican has nothing to do with the United States, is already a matter of history.

Church schools, which are part of the church's work, and the return of the Boxer indemnity, are worthy of Dulles boasting about himself, and a few days later Austin repeated it in the Security Council. In fact, Acheson had already mentioned it in "United States Relations With China" (i.e., the White Paper). In his letter to Truman, Acheson wrote: "Friendship between the two nations has been continuously enhanced through religious, charitable and cultural ties. This friendship is reflected in various good faith measures taken by the United States towards China over the years, such as the use of the Boxer indemnity for the education of Chinese students." But what was the motive for the so-called return of the Boxer indemnity? In 1907, James, the president of the University of Illinois, wrote to the American president: "That country which can educate this generation of young Chinese people will reap the greatest possible rewards in terms of spiritual and commercial influence due to the efforts paid in this respect. If the United States had already managed to guide the trend of Chinese students to this country thirty years ago, and could continue to expand this trend, then we would now be able to control China's development in the most complete and skillful way, that is to say, using the way of dominating China's leaders from knowledge and spirit." Therefore, this president very practically came to this conclusion: "Spending some money to expand spiritual influence, even from a purely material point of view, can achieve more than using other methods. Commerce follows spiritual domination, which is more reliable than following military banners."

This paragraph not only illustrates the true meaning of returning the Boxer indemnity, but can also be generally interpreted as the true meaning of the establishment of all church schools. That is to numb the national consciousness of Chinese young students, unknowingly accept the "American way of life," and become agents of the American imperialists, that is, Chinese who speak American, like Jiang Tingfu.

We may as well cite a few more examples of the actual operation of American church schools:

The "Report on Christian Education in China" stated: "The initial church schools were actually established to assist in evangelism. Since evangelists could not gain the faith of adults, they opened schools to gather children under the influence of Christian doctrines. As the Christian community gradually developed and churches were gradually established, it became necessary to expand the schools as a foundation for training teachers and pastors."

In 1925, an American teacher at Jiandao School in Wuzhou, Guangxi, said to students: "I do not love China, so I do not allow you to associate with other Chinese students to save the country together. I want you to obey me and love our America like me." In the same year, an American teacher at San Yu University in Shanghai also said to students: "Since you have entered a church school, you should cut off all national concepts, and there is no room for the word patriotism." (Note: San Yu University has long been closed. Quoted from Yang Xiaochun: "Christian Propaganda and the Movement to Recover Educational Rights")

Also, in 1925, at a church girls' middle school in Shanghai, the four-year curriculum totaled 208 credits, of which English and theology accounted for 70 credits, Chinese history only 4 credits, and there was no geography class. (Quoted from Shu Xincheng: "The Question of Recovering Church Middle Schools")

Although the Chinese government stipulated in 1925 that church schools should not aim to spread religion and should not include religious subjects in the required curriculum; but in 1929, Huilan Middle School in Zhejiang replaced required courses with elective religious courses; Xiuzhou Middle School in Zhejiang stipulated that religious courses be elective; Hujiang University in Shanghai claimed that the Department of Religion and the Department of Theology were established by another religious organization; and the East China Christian Education Conference resolved to replace religious courses with "Studies of Jesus' Teachings" and "Studies of Jesus' Life"; in this way to evade the regulations of the Chinese government.

This is the church school that the United States wants to run, which is also the "friendship" of church schools that Acheson, Dulles, and Austin tirelessly talk about. But the Chinese students are very clear. For these actions that are religious in name but aggressive in reality, before the "May 30th Incident," in 1924, there had been twelve church school disturbances, and after the "May 30th Incident" in 1925, there had been forty-four church school disturbances, to oppose the educational system of church schools and to express the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people. Although most of what is said here is historical, due to the Chinese people's resolute anti-imperialist struggle, some of the bad influences of imperialism no longer exist, but the Chinese people will continue to fight tirelessly to completely eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism, including foreign churches. Recently, due to Dulles' and Austin's arrogant words of "friendship" but actually slander, they have aroused the condemnation of numerous professors and students from major middle and church schools across the country, listing countless facts of aggression, and gave Dulles and Austin a severe rebuttal. Beijing Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Peking Union Medical College, Nanjing Jinling University, Ginling Women's College, Shanghai St. John's University, Shanghai University, Soochow University Law School, Jinan Qilu University, Changsha Xiangya Medical College and other universities have set off an anti-American wave, and are not anesthetized by Dulles and Austin's sweet words. On the contrary, they completely exposed the scams of Dulles and Austin. Our era is twenty-five years ahead of the "May 30th Incident." Now is the era of New Democracy. The People's Republic of China has been established. The song "The East is Red, the Sun Rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong" has been sung throughout the younger generation in China.

    揭露美帝教会对中国的侵略
    ·笔影·
    美国战争贩子杜勒斯，在十一月二十七日的联大政委会上，卖弄美国对中国的“友谊”，大谈其教会说：“我们和中国的关系主要基于一个具有宗教、文化和人道等方面的联系的悠久背景。这种关系由传教士开始。我教会派传教士到中国去已约有一百五十年的历史。我认为全美国的每个地区——不管这个地区有多大——都有派传教士到中国去传了许多年教的教会；在每个地区，每逢盛大的基督教的节日，每逢圣诞节和复活节，人们都聚在一起，做好包裹寄给他们在中国的传教士，去散发给中国人民。”他又说：“在整个历史中，美国一直始终不渝地做中国的朋友，我们曾用一切办法来维持中国的政治完整和领土完整，来增进中国的幸福，并在文化和人道的努力中援助中国。”杜勒斯讲得太迟了，因为教会事业的帝国主义侵略性，在义和团的具体反抗和五四运动后中国人民的民族觉醒，已将这种欺骗宣传的虚伪性，早已揭露无余了。然而帝国主义是善于做欺骗宣传的，所以毛主席致天津工商界的电上说：“美国帝国主义者对于中国人民做了很多的欺骗宣传，一切爱国者都不应相信这些欺骗言论。”我们绝不相信这些欺骗言论，但我们还有必要在中国人民面前揭露这些欺骗言论。
    我们现在就来打开美国教会在圣诞节或复活节“散给中国人民”的包裹，看看里面究竟包的是些什么东西。
    一八五八年的中美天津条约规定：“……嗣后所有安分传教习教之人，当一体矜恤保护，不可欺侮凌虐，凡遵照教规安分传习者他人毋得骚扰”（第二十九款）。
    一八五八年以前（及一八五八年以后）中国人民对于外国传教者及中国“吃教者”，因其侵略和压迫的行为，中国人民是一直给以恨怒和鄙视的。中国历史上的所谓“教案”就是这样发生的。美帝对于天津条约第二十九款的目的，就在于使用政治压力，取得传教的法律保障，来为美帝的侵略打开扩张传教的道路。谁以为中国人对于天主教和基督教是天生的信徒，那就大错特错了。耶稣基督是帝国主义者用军舰送进来的。中国有中国民族自己的宗教，中国人民和政府从未自愿的邀请过美国的传教士到中国来传教。恰恰相反，美国传教士和其他各国传教士一样，是把圣经当幌子，而服从资本帝国主义的利益，这样来为帝国主义的侵略，建立桥头堡垒；这样就举起外交条约大批地跑进中国来了。
    “教士招徒的方法，第一是张扬外国势力，吸引那种不堪官吏压榨或被别村别族侵侮的人‘投教’，这一类投教者，往往全村全族投靠教堂，依外力自卫或报仇，思想上似乎自认为外国顺民，与中国脱离关系。第二是出钱收买穷极无聊的人‘吃教’，买价不一，有的说‘白银四两’（《中西纪事》引吴德芝说），有的说‘给银一百三十两’（魏源《海国图记》），有的说‘教士们袋子里藏着大批的金钱，收买中国人民中间的无赖分子，来者不拒，总是临时的或经常的发给金钱’（罗得克夫《义和团记》）。这一类吃教者，把‘教民’当做一种头衔（义和团起义后，山东主教允许以后教民讲讼不准写教民字样，是非曲直一听地方官秉公讯办），依外力讹诈善良，包揽辞讼，力量比旧绅士更大。第三是宣传教义，得某些人的信仰。这一类人是真正‘信教者’，在教民中占极少数。事实上教堂是外国教士和投教者，吃教者共同组成的侵略团体。”——范文澜《中国近代史》第八章。
    美国教会确曾散发过包裹，有如上面所说的“四两”或“一百三十两”白银，改成现在的说法，就应该是若干“美元”了。但是，这种不平等条约，对于满清皇朝的统治阶级才会生效，对于中国人民却变得一钱不值。中国人民不仅没有被条约所限制，反而对帝国主义的侵略行为更加仇视，反帝情绪更加高涨。在一八五八年至一九○○年的四十二年之间，教案达六十余起之多，地域遍布于冀、鲁、苏、皖、浙、赣、闽、湘、鄂、川、康、滇、桂、黔及台湾十五省，最后爆发了大规模的义和团反帝运动。义和团本身虽有自己的弱点，但其本质是一个农民的反帝运动，而在表现形式上，却是以中国的民族宗教来反对外来的宗教—天主教和基督教的武装斗争。帝国主义者们趁此就组织了八国联军，攻入北京，赶走满清政府，索取很大的赔偿。刚好，自夸对中国人民有“友谊”的美国及其军队，就是这个“联军”的八分之一的组成者。它参加了“联军”这一大屠杀的代价，是分得了三千二百九十万两的赔偿。这一下我们就完全明白了，美国教会散发的“包裹”，这样就取回一笔如此大的带血的利息。假如以为美国的传教士真是些慈善的施舍者，那就未免太天真了。五十年后的今天，假如我们还让美国帝国主义者的杜勒斯这样来侮辱中国人民，认为杜勒斯的“包裹”并不坏，那就真是一个白痴。
    这样，天主教外籍司铎由一九○○年的八百余人，到一九一○年增到一千四百人左右；基督教外籍牧师由一九○六年的三千八百余人，到一九一○年增加到五千二百人左右。这就是义和团被帝国主义武装镇压与满清政府出卖的辛丑条约所发生的直接结果。
    刚在辛丑条约两年之后，一九○三年美国强迫中国政府订立中美通商行船上海续约，其中有一条规定：“……美国教会准在中国各处租赁及永租房屋地基，作为教会公产，以备传教之用……”。
    这又完全说明了帝国主义侵略工具——美国教会在中国急需霸占许多财产土地，作为侵略基地，倒不是杜勒斯所说的散发什么“包裹”给中国人民，而是中国人民向“基督”奉献了一大片土地。帝国主义者即理直气壮地在各地以极低廉的买价，勾结起当时腐败的官府和封建力量，强制人民把土地房屋用贱卖、贱典、让、罚、献、租、骗等不同方式，将大批良田，大块土地及高房大屋，均归教堂所有。略举一二事实为例：
    远在一八四八年，上海的美国圣公会主教文惠廉，当各国在上海划分租界的期间，这位主教便发动一个阴谋，经过交涉竟把他的教堂所在地苏州河北岸虹口一带，指为它的教堂地区，后来变为美国租界。一八九六年，山东登州（蓬莱）的美国教堂，强占民房，引起一场教案。实际上，美国教会已在全国范围内用各种办法，占有很大的土地与很多房屋，建筑教堂及修建住宅，甚至以地主资格出租土地与房屋。一九○三年的条约不过是对这一已成事实加以确认，并多得一层条约的保障罢了。由于这一条约的订立，美国教会更伸入到中国的边远区域，如西康省巴塘（即巴安）也有了美国教会。清光绪末年，美国教士兼医生，史德文以数百元之手续费，向巴塘县衙门租领大块土地，自建教堂、医院、学校；一九三一年还自动将围墙扩大，又侵占很大的土地。
    由这一二个例子，即可以看出美国教会在中国使用政治压力（条约的缔结）的结果所得的侵略地位。当然在这里我们更用不着去详细列举英、法、德、意等国过去用这同样的方法，从中国取得传教特权而发生的那些同样的情形了。美帝既用“最惠国”的门户开放政策加在中国的身上，那么凡英、法、德、意等国当时在传教方面取得什么特权，美帝都照样分得一份的。所以艾奇逊今年二月十六日所作的“总体外交”的讲演，也承认：“常常说帝国主义的进展是，首先派出传教士，然后是商人，再后是殖民地总督”这个命题的正确。美国最早派到中国的传教士裨治文曾说：“来华传教的人，与其说是由于宗教的原因，无宁说是政治的原因”。中美望厦条约的订立裨治文就亲自提供了有力的情报给美国政府，促成条约成立。经过教会，中国人得到的是“包裹”，而送给美国的却是国家主权。耶稣、商品和大炮是欧美帝国主义者侵略中国的整套工具。基督教伪装着慈善的面貌，大炮则狰狞地向中国开放，总目标是倾销商品，掠夺生产原料，然后派来一位总督，这就是帝国主义的侵略本质。杜勒斯之所以夸张传教的“友谊”，正是他念念不忘这个有效的侵略工具。
    另一方面，这些传教士在中国久了，是以“中国通”自命的。他们不仅替本国政府搜集情报，并且在其本国对中国的情形，大肆恶意宣传。中国人在欧美的观念是小脚、辫子与鸦片。这种观念一直到今天还没有能够完全改变，这些传教士是有一番“功绩”的。只有把中国说得顶坏，顶穷，顶糟糕，他们才能以耶稣的名义去向那些外国人老太婆化缘来在中国表示“友谊”。
    教会之作为侵略者的工具，是又直接的以一个间谍机关而存在的。它不仅了解中国各方面的情况，搜集各种情报，并协助帝国主义者的政治行动，进而发展到直接联络反动武装，屠杀中国人民。美帝国主义者与梵蒂冈密切勾结，就利用各地天主教进行这类间谍工作。一九四七年以前，献县张家庄的天主教在美国驻南京情报人员毛德指挥下，勾结蒋匪反动军队进攻解放区，给美国飞机指示轰炸目标，这已经是有案可查的了。最近，美帝通过梵蒂冈派驻朝鲜的天主教会的反动分子，进行间谍活动。一个美国与梵蒂冈联合的情报中心站已建立起来，负责指挥并调配在朝鲜及中国大陆上的间谍活动。因之美国在日本的特务头子威洛贝，曾极口称赞梵蒂冈这种“服务”精神，特别赞扬教皇派驻汉城的以鲍恩为首的教会，因为这个教会经常提供军事和轰炸目标的情报。梵蒂冈的经费来源的百分之八十是由美国帝国主义者供给的，所以梵蒂冈值得在这方面替美帝大卖气力。以为美国都是新教，天主教是属于法国意大利等国的，梵蒂冈与美国没有什么关系，这已经是历史上的事情了。
    教会事业之一的教会学校及退还庚子赔款，便值得杜勒斯自吹自捧一番，几天后奥斯汀又在安理会上重复的念一遍。其实，早在“中国与美国的关系”（即白皮书）中，艾奇逊已提出来过了。在致杜鲁门的信中，艾奇逊写道：“两民族间之友谊，每籍宗教、慈善事业及文化之联系而不断增强，此种友谊，散见于多年来美国对华之各项善意措施，如庚子赔款之移作中国学生教育用途。”但是所谓退还庚子赔款的动机是什么呢？一九○七年伊里诺大学校长詹姆士给美国总统的信说：“那一个国家能做到教育这一代的年青中国人，那一个国家就得由于这方面所支付的努力，而在精神的和商业的影响上，取回最大可能的收获。如果美国在三十年前已经做到把中国学生的潮流引向这一个国家来，并能使这潮流继续扩大，那么我们现在一定能够使用最圆满和最巧妙的方式而控制中国的发展，这就是说，使用那从知识与精神上支配中国的领袖方式。”于是这位校长很实际地做了这样的结论：“为了扩张精神上的影响，而花一些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能够比用别的方法收获得更多。商业追随精神上的支配，是比追随军旗更为可靠的。”
    这一段话不仅说明退还庚子赔款的真实意义，也可一般的解释为所有教会学校的建立的真实意义。那就是要麻痹中国青年学生的民族意识，在不知不觉中接受“美国生活方式”，变成美帝的代理人，即变成蒋廷黻之类的说美国话的中国人。
    我们不妨再举几个美国教会学校的实际办学的例子：
    “中国基督教教育事业”报告书中说：“最初之教会学校实为辅助传道而设，传道者既不能得成人之信仰，乃开设学校，俾得集孩童于基督教教义影响之下。迨教徒团体日渐发达，教堂渐已设立，于是乃不得不推广学校，以为养成教师牧师之基础。”
    一九二五年，广西梧州建道学校的美国教师对学生说：“我不爱中国，所以不许你们同其他中国学生往来，共同救国，我要你们服从我，同我一样地来爱我们的美国”。同年，上海三育大学的美国教师也对学生说：“你们已入教会学校读书，应该断绝一切国家的观念，爱国二字断无存在的余地。”（按：三育大学早已停办。引杨效春：“基督徒之宣传与收回教育权运动”）
    又一九二五年的上海一个教会女子中学，四年共修课程二百零八学分，其中英文与神学共占七十学分，中国史仅四学分，地理课无。（引舒新城：“收回教会中学问题”）
    虽然中国政府一九二五年已规定教会学校不得以传布宗教为宗旨，不得以宗教课目列入必修课；但在一九二九年浙江蕙兰中学则以宗教课为更替选修；浙江秀州中学则以宗教课为规定选修；上海沪江大学则托词宗教系与神学系为另一宗教机关所设；华东基督教教育会议则议决以“耶稣教训之研究”，“耶稣生平之研究”等代替宗教课；这样来躲过中国政府的规定。
    这就是美国所要办的教会学校，也就是艾奇逊，杜勒斯，奥斯汀不厌其烦的所说教会学校的“友谊”。但是中国学生是很清楚的，为了这些名宗教而实侵略的行动，“五卅”以前，一九二四就爆发过十二次的教会学校的风潮，“五卅”，一九二五就爆发过四十四次的教会学校的风潮，来反对教会学校的教育制度，来表示中国人民的爱国精神。虽然这里所说的大半都是历史情况，由于中国人民坚决的反帝斗争，某些帝国主义的恶劣影响，已不存在了，但中国人民将继续不懈怠的斗争下去，完全肃清帝国主义的残余力量，包括外国教会在内。最近，由于杜勒斯与奥斯汀的狂妄的名“友谊”而实诬蔑的言论，引起了全国各大中教会学校的教授与学生的列举无数侵略事实的斥责，给了杜勒斯与奥斯汀以严厉的回击。北京清华大学、燕京大学、辅仁大学、协和医学院、南京金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院、上海圣约翰大学、沪江大学、东吴大学法学院、济南齐鲁大学、长沙湘雅医学院等都掀起了反美控美的浪潮，并不为杜勒斯与奥斯汀的甜言蜜语所麻醉。相反的，完全揭露了杜勒斯与奥斯汀的骗局。我们的时代比“五卅”又已前进二十五年了。现在是新民主主义时代了。中华人民共和国已建立起来了。“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”的歌声已唱遍在中国青年一代了。
