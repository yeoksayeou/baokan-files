    Tibetan People Mourn Gedda Living Buddha
    By our reporter accompanying the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, Shen Shi
    The Tibetan people mourn the death of Gedda Living Buddha in Qamdo with deep sorrow.
    The Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group visited Senka, the hometown of Gedda Living Buddha. The lamas of Baily Temple and the residents of Senka greeted the visiting group with tears in their eyes. They thanked the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Chairman Liu Bocheng for their concern for Gedda Living Buddha. They were saddened to learn that they would never see their most respected Living Buddha again.
    During the visiting group's stay in Ganzi, Tibetan residents near Ganzi came to inquire about the news of Gedda Living Buddha. Gongga Jiangze, the head of Mashu Township, and the Ganzi Lama Temple also recited scriptures and prayed for Gedda. Farmer Ge Luo told Liu Geping, the head of the Central Visiting Group, about the situation of Gedda Living Buddha's family. Herdsmen from Niuchang, lamas from Dengke, Shiqu, Baiyu, Dege and other places were all worried about the safety of Gedda Living Buddha. Gedda Living Buddha had a profound influence on the Tibetan people, and his words and deeds were deeply engraved in their hearts.
    Gedda Living Buddha died for the liberation of Tibet, for the Tibetan people to get rid of the shackles of imperialism. After the liberation of Ganzi, on July 4th, Gedda Living Buddha disregarded all dissuasion and resolutely left Ganzi for Qamdo. He was full of hope, wanting to bring to the Tibetan people west of the Jinsha River the thriving and brilliant prospects of the new China, the practical actions he personally experienced of the People's Government respecting the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, freedom of religious belief, and the excellent discipline of the People's Liberation Army of not taking a single needle or thread from the people. After arriving in Qamdo, he painstakingly and patiently explained the ethnic policies of the Common Program of the CPPCC to his old friends and lama temples in Qamdo, hoping to eliminate their concerns about the People's Government caused by the deceptive propaganda of imperialist elements. He was poisoned by British imperialist agents and died heroically.
    Gedda Living Buddha was an old friend of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and General Liu Bocheng. He had a deep friendship with the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army for fifteen years. In 1935, the Red Army went north to resist Japan, passing through the Ganzi area. He and the Tibetan people gave the Red Army strong support, raising grain and grass, and trying their best to eliminate the doubts of the lama temples about the Red Army. The Chinese people will never forget these achievements. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, he, Xia Ke Dao Deng, and Bangda Duoji formed the "Boba Yitewa Government" in the Ganzi area. Gedda Living Buddha was the chairman of the "Boba Yitewa Government." "Boba" means Tibetan, and the "Boba Yitewa Government" is the Tibetan People's Government. To this day, the Tibetan people still miss that government and praise that government as their own government. When the Red Army transferred to Yushu, Qinghai, Gedda Living Buddha and the Tibetan militia contained Ma Bufang's bandit army and covered the Red Army's retreat. He hid Red Army wounded and sick who could not be transferred with the Red Army main force and remained in the Ganzi area. His brother-in-law was a veteran Red Army soldier.
    Gedda Living Buddha was deeply influenced by Commander-in-Chief Zhu because of his frequent contact with him, and he also had a further understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and the situation of the Chinese revolution. He firmly believed that the Chinese people's revolution would surely be victorious. Before leaving Ganzi, Commander-in-Chief Zhu said to Gedda Living Buddha: The Red Army will definitely return to Ganzi in ten or fifteen years. Gedda Living Buddha said to his relatives and friends: "The Red Army will always return to Ganzi one day, and the Tibetan people will always have a chance to stand up." Fifteen years later, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's remarkable prediction has become a reality, and Gedda Living Buddha has personally seen the five-star national flag of the People's Republic of China flying over the vast plains of the Jinsha River and the Dadu River.
    Gedda Living Buddha deeply cared about the Red Army after leaving the Ganzi area and never forgot Commander-in-Chief Zhu and General Liu Bocheng. He often inquired about the news of the Red Army. Under the layers of blockade by the Kuomintang reactionary bandits, he sent people to Qinghai secretly to buy back the "Battle Map of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi" and personally brought back a portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu from Lhasa. The proclamation of the Red Army protecting the lama temple in those years is still preserved in the Baily Lama Temple today. In the sound of the People's Liberation Army marching into the Great Northwest, Gedda Living Buddha dispatched Bai Zhi and others, representing the Tibetan people of Xikang, to pass through the enemy blockade line, detour through Qinghai, and go to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    When the People's Liberation Army entered Kangding, Gedda Living Buddha was appointed as a member of the Kangding Military Control Commission. He presided over a mass meeting of more than 3,000 people in Ganzi to celebrate the liberation and sent representatives to Kangding to welcome the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the highway from Ya'an to Ganzi had not yet been built, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Ganzi area was temporarily short of food. Gedda Living Buddha and Xia Ke Dao Deng raised a large amount of grain and firewood, and organized yaks to transport them day and night. He said: "We cannot see our own army starving."
    When the Southwest Military and Political Committee was established, Gedda Living Buddha was appointed as a member of the Military and Political Committee. When the People's Government of Xikang Province was established, Gedda Living Buddha was appointed as the vice chairman. Gedda Living Buddha was a specially invited representative to the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At that time, the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu specially sent telegrams inviting Gedda Living Buddha to go to Beijing to attend the meeting, but Gedda, who was busy with the cause of the liberation of the Tibetan people, did not go to Beijing. He decided to go to Qamdo, saying: "It is not too late to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu after the peaceful liberation of Tibet." However, soon after he arrived in Qamdo, news of his tragic poisoning came out. He could not meet his old friends—Commander-in-Chief Zhu and General Liu Bocheng—whom he had been separated from for fifteen years, and he could not personally see the five-star red flag flying on the Tibetan plateau, but his love for the Tibetan people will remain forever. His death has filled the Kangzang Plateau with hatred for imperialism.
    Gedda Living Buddha had a lofty character, never bowing to reactionary forces, and never being moved by the bribery of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. He resolutely rejected Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "National Congress Representative." He lived a simple life and was approachable. The clothes he wore were given to him by Chijiang Renboqin of Lhasa more than ten years ago, and they were all tattered now. He took the alms received by the Baily Lama Temple, in addition to the temple offerings, and used them to help the poor. He often treated nearby residents for illnesses. When he went to Qamdo, the herdsmen from the cattle farm came to see him off. He said to the herdsmen: "The medicine of the People's Liberation Army is a thousand times more effective than my own medicine. I want to bring the medicine of the People's Liberation Army to the Tibetan people and let them be liberated from the shackles of imperialism." The people who saw him off were all moved to tears.
    The death of Gedda Living Buddha is an irreparable loss to the Chinese people, especially the Tibetan people. The imperialist elements frantically poisoned Gedda Living Buddha, attempting to obstruct the peaceful liberation of Tibet, but they cannot stop the Chinese people's determination to liberate Tibet. The Chinese people will resolutely liberate the southwestern territory of the motherland—Tibet, and resolutely drive the imperialist aggressor forces out of all the territory, in order to forever commemorate the spirit of Gedda Living Buddha's heroic sacrifice for the country and the Tibetan people.

    藏族人民痛悼格达活佛
    本报随中央西南各民族访问团记者  沈石
    藏族人民以沉痛的心情，悼念死难于昌都的格达活佛。
    中央西南各民族访问团访问格达活佛的故乡森卡，白利寺的喇嘛和森卡的居民，热泪盈眶地迎接访问团，他们感谢中央人民政府、毛主席、朱总司令和刘伯承主席对格达活佛的关怀，他们悲痛地知道再也不能见到他们最尊敬的活佛了。
    访问团在甘孜停留期间，甘孜附近的藏族居民纷纷前来打听格达活佛的消息，麻书乡乡长贡呷降泽、甘孜喇嘛寺还给格达念经祈祷，农民葛洛告诉中央访问团刘格平团长关于格达活佛家属的情况。来自牛场的牧民，来自邓柯、石渠、白玉、瞻化等地的喇嘛，都担心格达活佛的安全。格达活佛对藏族人民影响太深了，他的言行深深地铭记在藏族人民的心头。
    格达活佛是为着西藏的解放而死的，是为着西藏人民摆脱帝国主义的羁绊而死的。甘孜解放后，七月四日，格达活佛谢绝各方面的劝阻，毅然离开甘孜，前往昌都，他满怀着热望，想要带给金沙江以西藏族人民的，是新中国欣欣向荣、光芒万丈的前景，是他切身体会的人民政府尊重藏族人民风俗习惯、宗教信仰自由等实际行动和人民解放军不拿人民一针一线的优良纪律。他到达昌都后，苦口婆心、循循善诱地向昌都的故交和喇嘛寺解释政协共同纲领的民族政策，冀图消除他们因受帝国主义分子欺骗宣传对人民政府所存在的顾虑。竟遭英帝国主义特务毒害，慷慨就义。
    格达活佛是朱总司令、刘伯承将军的老友，他和中国共产党、人民解放军有着十五年深厚的友情。一九三五年，红军北上抗日，经过甘孜地区，他和藏族人民给予红军有力的援助，筹措粮草，想尽办法消除喇嘛寺对红军的疑虑，这些功绩，中国人民永远不会忘怀。在中国共产党领导下，他和夏克刀登、邦达多吉在甘孜地区组成“博巴伊特瓦政府”，格达活佛是“博巴伊特瓦政府”的主席，“博巴”是藏族，“博巴伊特瓦政府”就是藏族人民政府，直到今天，藏族人民还留恋那个政府，还啧啧称道那个政府是他们自己的政府。红军向青海玉树方面转移，格达活佛和藏族民兵牵制了马步芳匪军，掩护红军撤退。他掩蔽不能随红军主力转移而留在甘孜地区的红军伤病员，他的妹夫，就是一位红军的老战士。
    格达活佛因和朱总司令经常接触，受朱总司令影响最深，对中国共产党和中国革命形势也有进一步的了解。他深信中国人民革命必然胜利。朱总司令临别甘孜前，曾向格达活佛说了这样一句话：十年或十五年，红军一定回到甘孜来。格达活佛向他的戚友说：“红军总有重回甘孜的一天，藏族人民总有翻身的一天。”十五年后的今天，朱总司令卓越的预见已经成为事实，而格达活佛又亲自见到了中华人民共和国的五星国旗飘扬在金沙江、大渡河广大的原野。
    格达活佛深切地关怀着离开甘孜地区后的红军，念念不忘朱总司令和刘伯承将军。经常打听红军的消息，在国民党反动匪帮层层的封锁下，他派人到青海暗地里买回“八路军山西奋战图”，亲自从拉萨带回朱总司令的像片。当年红军保护喇嘛寺的布告，白利喇嘛寺到今天还保存着。人民解放军向大西北进军声中，格达活佛派遣白志等三人，代表西康藏族人民，穿过敌人封锁线，绕道青海，到北京向毛主席和朱总司令致敬。
    人民解放军进驻康定，格达活佛被任命为康定军管会委员，在甘孜主持了三千人以上的群众大会，庆贺解放，并派遣代表前往康定欢迎解放军。当时从雅安到甘孜的公路还没有修通，进驻甘孜地区的解放军一时缺乏粮食，格达活佛和夏克刀登等筹借出大量的粮食柴草，组织牦牛昼夜驮运，他说：“我们不能看到自己的军队饿着肚皮。”
    西南军政委员会成立，格达活佛被任命为军政委员会委员，西康省人民政府成立，格达活佛被任命为副主席，政治协商会议全国委员会第二次会议，格达活佛是特别邀请代表，当时中央人民政府、毛主席和朱总司令曾特电邀请格达活佛前往北京出席会议，但是为着藏族人民解放事业正忙碌着的格达，没有赴北京，他决心前往昌都，他说：“等到西藏和平解放了，再去北京见毛主席、朱总司令还不为迟。然而在他到达昌都后不久，便传出了他惨遭毒害的噩耗。他不能和他阔别十五年的老友——朱总司令、刘伯承将军——见面了，他不能亲自看到五星红旗飘扬在西藏高原了，但是，他的遗爱却长留在藏族人民之中，他的死难，使康藏高原充满了对帝国主义的仇恨。
    格达活佛有着崇高的气节，决不向反动势力低头，决不为蒋介石匪帮的利诱所动。他断然拒绝了蒋匪的所谓“国大代表”。他生活俭朴，平易近人，身着的衣服，是十多年前拉萨赤降仁博钦送给他的，现在全都破烂了。白利喇嘛寺所得的布施，除寺庙供奉外，他拿出来济助穷人。他经常给附近居民治病，去昌都时，牛场上的牧民前来送行，他对牧民说：“解放军的药，比我自己的药功效大千百倍，我要把解放军的药带给西藏人民，让他们从帝国主义桎梏下解放出来。”送行的人都感动得流泪了。
    格达活佛的死，是中国人民，特别是藏族人民不可弥补的损失。帝国主义分子疯狂的毒害格达活佛，妄图阻挠西藏的和平解放，但决不能挡住中国人民解放西藏的决心，中国人民将坚决解放祖国西南部的领土——西藏，坚决将帝国主义侵略势力赶出全部国土，以永志格达活佛壮烈的为国为藏民而牺牲的精神。
