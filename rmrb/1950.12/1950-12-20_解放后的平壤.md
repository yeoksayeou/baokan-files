    Pyongyang After Liberation
    By our reporter Tan Wenrui
    Seven days after the liberation of Pyongyang, which had been occupied by the American invaders and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang for a month and a half, I met a Korean People's Army officer from there in a certain area of northern Korea and heard him talk about the simple situation of this glorious people's city before and after liberation.
    The American invading army retreated in extreme disarray, with various vehicles and scattered supplies lying crookedly everywhere, many of which had not had time to be destroyed. But even in their hasty retreat, they did not forget to create more disasters for the Korean people. These robbers and murderers intended to burn down the entire city of Pyongyang, leaving almost no complete large buildings. The pervasive smell of burning filled the city and had not dissipated for several days, covering the snow with a layer of black smoke.
    On the afternoon of December 6th, the people of Pyongyang welcomed their liberators with tears in their eyes. When they saw the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, they shouted "Long live! Long live!" in frenzy.
    The devastated people recounted with incomparable grief and indignation the crimes of the American invaders and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. After occupying Pyongyang, they began a large-scale massacre, searching for Korean patriots every day. More than eight thousand people were killed by their poisonous hands, and the wives and daughters of more than one thousand five hundred patriotic men were raped and then shot. The bodies of the victims could be found in many wells and air-raid shelters. When the Syngman Rhee bandit gang occupied Pyongyang, they attempted to deceive the people with a compassionate face, saying they sympathized with the people's plight and would exempt them from the "tax in kind," but in reality, they used various despicable means to plunder as much grain as possible to supply the American invading army. The puppet government even openly forced Korean women aged fifteen to thirty to form so-called "comfort teams" to satisfy the invading army's lust. Speaking of the crimes of the American and Rhee bandits, no one did not hate them to the bone, and many older men demanded to follow the Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteers south to take revenge.
    Some staff members of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government have followed the army back to Pyongyang to engage in comforting and relieving the people. People who fled to the mountains to avoid the enemy during the enemy occupation have returned one after another, unafraid of enemy planes' frenzied bombing, and are assisting the government in clearing the ruins.
    Pyongyang after the catastrophe is desolate. The Korean people will transform their anger into strength, redouble their efforts to strike the enemy, and demand that the American invaders pay their blood debt.

    解放后的平壤
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    被美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮占领了一个半月的平壤解放后第七天，记者在朝鲜北部某地遇到了一位从那边来的朝鲜人民军军官，听他谈到这一座光辉的人民城市解放前后的简单情况。
    美国侵略军撤退时是异常狼狈的，到处是歪歪倒倒的各种车辆和星散的物资，有许多还没有来得及破坏。但是在他们匆促溃退的时候还不忘记给朝鲜人民制造更多的灾难，这些强盗和凶手打算把整个平壤城焚毁，几乎没有留下一所完整的比较大的建筑物。充溢全城的焦臭气味好几天后还没有消散，向雪上盖着一层黑烟。
    十二月六日的下午，平壤城里的朝鲜人民怀着热泪欢迎他们的解放者，当他们看见和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军的时候，都如狂地高呼“万岁！万岁！”
    饱遭劫难的老百姓以无比的悲愤诉说美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的罪行。他们占领平壤后就开始大屠杀，天天搜捕朝鲜的爱国者，有八千多人遭了他们的毒手，一千五百多名爱国志士的妻女也被强奸后枪杀，在许多水井和防空洞里都可以发现被害者的尸首。李承晚匪帮在占据平壤的时候，曾经企图以慈悲面孔欺骗人民，说是体恤民困，免征“现物税”，实际上却用各种卑劣手段搜刮可能搜刮的粮食，来供奉美国侵略军队。傀儡政府并竟公开强征十五岁至三十岁的朝鲜妇女组织所谓“慰安队”，给侵略军泄欲。说到美李匪帮的罪恶，没有一个人不切齿痛恨，许多上了年纪的男人都要求跟着朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿军南下报仇。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一部分工作人员已跟着军队的后面回到了平壤，从事安抚和救济人民的工作。在敌人占领期间逃到山沟去躲避的人民已陆续回来，不怕敌机疯狂轰炸，协助政府清理废墟。
    劫后的平壤是一片凄凉的，朝鲜人民将化愤怒为力量，加倍打击敌人，要美侵略者偿还血债。
