East China

[Our Newspaper] People from all parts of East China are writing letters and making comfort bags to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and to congratulate them on the great victory in Korea.

In their congratulatory telegram celebrating the great victory in Korea, all commanders and fighters of the East China Public Security Forces said: "Comrades of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, advance bravely and rapidly, advance again! In front of you is a group of beasts hated by everyone and low in morale; behind you are the infinitely powerful and indignant people of all China and peace-loving people all over the world. We are watching every day, every hour, and every specific heroic act of yours with the feelings of ten fingers connected to the heart and flesh and blood. We are looking forward day and night with 120,000 points of earnestness to the greater, larger, and more glorious victories you have painstakingly created."

I want to train my children to be firm and decisive from an early age, so that they can be warriors who defend world peace and defend the motherland like you in the future." Yang Jiyuan, a worker at the Radio Factory, wrote in his comfort letter: "I am a tool management worker. I want to support you with practical actions. I will take good care of the tools, and I will study current affairs diligently to arm my mind."
