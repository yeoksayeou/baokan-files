    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th—The Italian people have unleashed a tide of protest against the government's obedience to the commands of U.S. imperialism in accepting the decisions of the Brussels conference and pursuing a policy of war preparation.
    The Italian Communist Party's organ, *L'Unità*, emphasized that "Italy's independence has been sacrificed in Brussels" and strongly condemned the Gasperi government for signing such a treacherous document that "undermines Italian sovereignty." Nenni, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, wrote to the Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, urging him to immediately prompt the government to report the results of the Brussels conference to the parliament and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. Italian democrats have questioned who authorized the government to sign the Brussels decision, which places the armed forces, the symbol and guarantee of national independence, entirely under foreign control. They unanimously condemned the government's attempt to avoid a public debate on the Brussels conference's decisions and emphasized that the military expansion plan proposed by the government on the 19th, entirely dictated by the Americans, will exacerbate the already existing inflation.
    Factory workers in Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Genoa, Modena, Novara, and other cities went on strike for one hour on the 21st to protest the fascist "security law" promulgated by the government to push Italy towards war. Workers at the massive "Fiat" factory in Turin passed a resolution stating that the Italian working class is fully prepared to crush the war-mongers' conspiracy to drag Italy into an imperialist war, and workers will never allow civilian production to be converted to arms production. On the same day, 700,000 metallurgical and machine workers across Italy also went on strike for four hours and held mass rallies to protest the government's plan to "adjust" the metallurgical and machine industries, causing large-scale unemployment, in order to execute the American order to turn Italian factories into repair shops for their mechanized forces. Eighty to one hundred percent of the metallurgical and machine manufacturing workers in Italy's major industrial areas participated in the strike, and the divisive union's conspiracy to sabotage the strike completely failed. The general strike in the province of Savona lasted for eight hours, and workers in other industries in the province of Spezia also joined the metallurgical workers' strike. The workers' strike brought urban transportation and trade in these two provinces to a standstill for two hours.

    意大利各地工人罢工
    【新华社二十五日讯】意大利人民已展开抗议的怒潮，反对政府听从美帝国主义的命令，接受布鲁塞尔会议的决定并奉行备战政策。
    意大利共产党机关报《团结报》着重指出“意大利的独立已在布鲁塞尔被牺牲”，并痛斥加斯贝利政府签署这样严重地“破坏意大利主权”的卖国文件。社会党总书记南尼致书议会外交委员会主席，要求立即促请政府向议会及下院外交委员会报告布鲁塞尔会议的结果。意大利的民主人士纷纷质问是谁授权政府签置布鲁塞尔决定，而把作为国家独立之象征与保证的武装部队完全置于外国人支配之下。他们一致谴责政府企图避免对布鲁塞尔会议的决定作公开辩论，并着重指出：政府在十九日提出的完全是由美国人授意的扩军计划，将使已经存在的通货膨胀更形严重。
    都灵、米兰、佛罗伦萨、巴利、热那亚、摩登纳、诺瓦拉及其他城市的工厂工人，都在二十一日罢工一小时，抗议政府为把意大利推向战争而颁布法西斯“安全法”。都灵规模宏大的“兹亚特”工厂的工人通过决议说：意大利工人阶级已有充分准备，要粉碎战争贩子把意大利拖入帝国主义战争中的阴谋，工人们决不容许将民用生产改为军火生产。同日，全意七十万冶金与机器工人也罢工四小时，并纷纷举行群众大会，抗议政府为执行美国沦意大利工厂为其机械化部队修配厂的命令，而“调整”冶金与机器工业计划，因此使大批工人失业。意大利各主要工业区百分之八十到百分之百的冶金与机器制造工业的工人都参加了罢工，分裂分子工会破坏罢工的阴谋完全失败。萨窝那省的大罢工延续了八小时，斯培西亚省其他工业的工人也参加了冶金工人的罢工；工人们的罢工使这两省的城市交通与贸易停顿两小时。
