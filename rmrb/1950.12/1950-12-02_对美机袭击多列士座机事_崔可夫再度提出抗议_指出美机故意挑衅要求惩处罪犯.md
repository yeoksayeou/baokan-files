    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th TASS dispatch: On November 20th, the United States High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy, sent a note to General Chuikov, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany, attempting to justify the attack on November 17th by an American jet fighter in the American occupation zone of Germany on a Soviet passenger plane carrying French Communist Party General Secretary and member of the National Assembly, Togliatti.

    In his note, McCloy insisted that the American authorities only granted the Soviet aircraft "diplomatic permission" to cross the American occupation zone of Germany, and did not establish the technical conditions for the flight. Based on these reasons, McCloy attempted to accuse the Soviet aircraft's pilot of violating flight rules.

    General Chuikov sent McCloy a second note in response, stating: "The statement contained in your letter, indicating that the Soviet aircraft only received 'diplomatic permission' to cross the American occupation zone of Germany, is contrary to the facts and cannot be used as a reason for the American fighter attack.

    The American authorities not only agreed to the flight of the aforementioned aircraft, but also confirmed in writing on November 10th the route (via Frankfurt am Main) and other technical conditions for flying over American territory, which the Soviet pilot fully complied with. When the Soviet aircraft left Paris at 15:30 Moscow time on November 11th this year, the American authorities immediately received notification from the Berlin Air Safety Center. While the Soviet aircraft was flying over French territory, the Frankfurt am Main air traffic control station was notified by telephone, and instructions were received from that station regarding the confirmation of the flight route and altitude (5,000 feet).

    However, when the Soviet aircraft approached the American occupation zone, the American Air Transport Control Center (Frankfurt am Main), disregarding international regulations and violating the security guarantees and flight conditions previously put forward by the American authorities, avoided maintaining further radio contact and repeatedly refused to answer signals from the Soviet aircraft. All attempts by the French pilot escorting the Soviet aircraft to establish radio contact were ignored by the Frankfurt Air Transport Control Center, as confirmed by the French pilot in a statement published in the newspapers. The radio telegram sent to the American Air Transport Control Center regarding the American fighter's attack on the Soviet aircraft also received no response. At the same time, radio communication with Berlin was very good.

    The facts listed above confirm that the American fighter's attack on the Soviet aircraft was an act of deliberate provocation.

    I insist on my protest regarding this matter and reiterate my demand that the criminals be punished."

    对美机袭击多列士座机事
    崔可夫再度提出抗议
    指出美机故意挑衅要求惩处罪犯
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十八日电：十一月二十日，美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃，致苏联驻德管制委员会主席崔可夫将军照会一件，企图把美国喷气战斗机于十一月十七日在美国占领区袭击为法共总书记国民议会议员多列士所乘坐的苏联客机一事说成有理。
    麦克洛埃在他的照会中硬说美国当局只给与苏联飞机以“外交上的允许”越过德境美国占领区，而没有对该飞机确立飞行的技术条件。麦克洛埃根据这些理由企图指责苏联飞机驾驶员违反飞行规则。
    崔可夫将军为此送致麦克洛埃第二件照会，内称：“在阁下来件中所包含的陈述，说明苏联飞机只得到‘外交的允许’越过德境美国占领区，这是违反事实的，不能作为美国战斗机袭击的一个理由。
    美国当局不但同意上述飞机的飞行，并且在十一月十日以书面形式确定了路线（经过美因河畔法兰克福）以及已为苏联驾驶员所充分遵守的在美国区域上空飞行的其它技术条件。在本年十一月十一日莫斯科时间十五时三十分，苏联飞机离开巴黎时美国当局立刻从柏林空中安全中心得到通知。苏联飞机在法国领土上空飞行时就用电话通知美因河畔法兰克福的交通管制站，并从该站得到关于飞行路线的确定和飞行高度（五千英尺）的指示。
    然而，当苏联飞机飞近美国占领区时，美国空运管制中心（美因河畔法兰克福），不顾国际法规并且违反了美国当局先前提出的关于安全的保障和飞行的条件，而避免保持进一步的无线电联系，对苏联飞机一再发出的信号拒不答复。在苏联飞机上护送的法国驾驶员，设法建立无线电联系的一切企图，都被法兰克福空运管制中心置之不理，这已由法国驾驶员在报纸上发表的声明所证实了。拍发给美国空运管制中心的关于美国战斗机袭击苏联飞机的无线电报，也没有得到答复。同时和柏林方面的无线电联系，都是非常良好地开放着。
    上面列举的事实，确证美国战斗机袭击苏联飞机的行为乃是属于故意挑衅性质。
    我对此事坚持我的抗议，并再度要求惩处罪犯。”
