Xinhua News Agency, December 28th—The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a meeting on the 27th to welcome women representatives to the World Peace Congress who recently returned to China. Those in attendance included Li Dequan, Kang Keqing, Cao Mengjun, Lu Cui, Cao Ming, Huang Zongying, and representatives from various women's organizations and schools in Beijing, totaling over 700 people. The returning women representatives conveyed to the women of Beijing the spirit and resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. Li Dequan said: This peace conference further expanded and consolidated the unity of the people of the world under the common goal of defending world peace, and unanimously recognized that peace cannot be waited for; peace must be fought for. At the same time, the conference also educated the people of the world to recognize who are the instigators and initiators of war, and who are the defenders of world peace. When the Korean representative Park Jeong-ae accused American imperialism of its bloody crimes in Korea, an American woman representative ran to the Chinese representative's position and said: "I did not expect that our government did so many bad things. I must go back and tell our compatriots to fight together for peace." Li Dequan said that today China's movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country is our concrete and effective action to defend world peace. Each of us must learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and strive to defend peace.

Subsequently, Lu Cui, Cao Ming, and Huang Zongying spoke successively, reporting the important achievements of this peace conference and the trust and love of the people of the world for our people.

    全国民主妇联集会
    欢迎返国和大妇女代表
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于二十七日集会，欢迎最近返国的和大妇女代表。到有李德全、康克清、曹孟君、陆璀、草明、黄宗英及北京市各妇女团体学校代表共七百余人。返国和大妇女代表们向北京市的妇女传达了第二届世界保卫和平大会的精神与决议。李德全说：这次和平大会更扩大和巩固了全世界人民在保卫世界和平的共同目标下的团结，并一致认识到和平不能等待，和平必须争取。同时，大会也教育了全世界人民，认识了谁是战争的挑拨者与发动者，谁是世界和平的保卫者。当朝鲜代表朴正爱控诉美帝国主义在朝鲜的血腥罪行后，一个美国妇女代表跑到中国代表的位置上来说：“我没有想到我们的政府做了这样多的坏事。我回去一定要告诉我们的同胞，要他们一齐为和平而斗争。”李德全说，今天中国的抗美援朝保家卫国运动就是我们保卫世界和平的具体而有效的行动。我们每一个人都要学习中国人民志愿部队英勇的战斗精神，为保卫和平而努力。
    接着由陆璀、草明及黄宗英等相继发言。分别报告了这次和平大会的重要成就和世界人民对我国人民的信赖与热爱之情。
