After the directive on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities jointly issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court in July of this year was implemented in various provinces and cities across the country, counter-revolutionary elements have been severely hit; the deviation of misinterpreting the "lenient policy" or the so-called "boundless leniency" existing in local public security work has been basically corrected. However, this tendency has not been thoroughly corrected. Recently, based on the existing achievements, the central government and the leading public security and judicial organs of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities have systematically reviewed the deviation of so-called "boundless leniency" and formulated a plan to thoroughly correct this deviation, which is of great significance for continuing to eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants and consolidate revolutionary order. According to the review reports from various localities, the deviation of misinterpreting the lenient policy is serious and quite common; therefore, it is not an easy task to thoroughly correct this deviation from actual work, especially from the ideological perspective, so that Chairman Mao's policy of combining suppression and leniency, that is, severely punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service, can be better implemented.

The review reports from various provinces indicate that the main manifestation of the "boundless leniency" deviation is that the sentencing of captured counter-revolutionary ringleaders is not severe enough and not timely enough. For example, in Northeast China, Nan Shoushan, the leader of the Kuomintang secret service who plotted the assassination of General Li Zhaolin, was only sentenced to a short-term imprisonment. Liu Yongnian, the technical section chief of the puppet Lanzhou Second Division captured in Xinjiang, was not even sentenced and was released rashly, while Liu Yongnian was a heinous criminal who planted 1,600 landmines after the liberation of Lanzhou and destroyed the Xiangtang Bridge. Wang Jun, the interrogation section chief of the Kuomintang special agent organ "No. 19" in Shijiazhuang, whose crimes were unforgivable, was detained for nearly three years before being dealt with recently. As for the prison management system, it is not strict enough, and it has already caused several prisoner escape incidents.

The existence of these phenomena has fueled the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements and aroused the dissatisfaction of the people. Some special agents even openly said that the Public Security Bureau is a "Public Security Inn" and called the court a "Judicial Hotel." The people felt that "the government is so lenient that there is no limit." Even some honest old gentlemen couldn't stand it and warned us: "Only those who can eliminate violence and bring peace can win the allegiance of the people." However, for a considerable period of time in the past, some of our cadres turned a blind eye to these phenomena of boundless leniency. What is the reason for this?

This is because, under the victorious situation, some cadres developed a serious sense of complacency and lost the vigilance they should have had against the enemy's hidden sabotage activities. Originally, this kind of thinking should not exist in the vast new areas; however, the great victory on the front of suppressing bandits and counter-espionage has stabilized or consolidated the revolutionary order, which has also made some cadres careless. In this way, whether in the old areas or in the new areas, complacency has become a common phenomenon. Some people feel that "the special agents have been almost completely eliminated by us." They have forgotten that even in the old areas, there are still many hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and in the new areas, our victory on the front of suppressing bandits and counter-espionage has only basically defeated the military strength of the bandits and special agents, that is, defeated the large groups of bandits, while the hidden special agent organizations have not been completely destroyed, and the large groups of bandits, after being severely hit, are turning or have already turned into scattered small groups of hidden activities. Comrades who do not have a clear understanding of these basic situations are only satisfied with the victories they have achieved. They have forgotten Comrade Stalin's great teaching: "The greater the power of the state, the more vehement will be the resistance of the last remnants of the dying classes." (Problems of Leninism, page 528, 1949 Moscow edition) They have forgotten what Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: after the open, visible, and armed enemies are overthrown, the hidden, invisible, and unarmed enemies still exist, and "they are bound to fight us to the death." Some people, while admitting that hidden enemies still exist, feel that "millions of Kuomintang bandit troops have been defeated by us, and a few special agent claws are nothing great and cannot achieve anything." This view is also incorrect. As early as March 1937, Comrade Stalin criticized this erroneous view and earnestly warned against comforting oneself because of the small number of counter-revolutionary saboteurs. He said: "To carry out sabotage, it does not require a large number of people. To build the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, tens of thousands of workers are needed, but to destroy this project, perhaps at most only a few dozen people are needed. To win a battle, several armies of the Red Army are needed, but to undermine this victory on the front line, it only takes a few spies in a certain army headquarters, or even in a certain division headquarters, who can steal the battle plan and hand it over to the enemy." (Selected Works of Stalin, Volume V, page 309, Northeast Xinhua Bookstore edition) This means that we must not only look at the problem from the number of counter-revolutionary elements, but we should look at the harm that counter-revolutionary elements may cause to the state and the people.

Secondly, some cadres have a strong old legal viewpoint. They do not act in accordance with Chairman Mao's correct policy, nor in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program, but create their own set of strange "theories" and treat counter-revolutionary elements according to this set of strange "theories." Therefore, some people believe that "murder and arson are the general behavior of the pseudo-stubborn," which seems unimportant. Some places believe that the counter-revolutionary mastermind "only approved the killing, but did not carry it out," therefore, "occupational crimes cannot be punished with death." However, they emphasize that the murderer "is only the executor, not the mastermind." Some places treat special agents who kill people's public security personnel as "first offenders" and sentence them to lighter imprisonment. Some places regard special agents who conspire to organize riots but fail as ordinary "attempted offenders" and do not punish them severely. Some places even interpret the criminal act of bandits killing people's postal workers as a "self-defense measure," arguing that the postal workers went to catch the bandits, and the bandits could not but "defend themselves." These confused thoughts are individual, but they are serious. This is not just ideological confusion, but extreme ambiguity in position. In addition, some cadres have the idea of "education is omnipotent" and talk emptily about "having the courage to reform bad people." The policy they follow when dealing with counter-revolutionary cases is not the policy of combining suppression and leniency, but the so-called "education as the main and punishment as the auxiliary" policy, regardless of the size of the crime. Obviously, it is unnecessary to explain that all these ideas are completely wrong. The starting point for these comrades in considering problems is either the old legal provisions, or the counter-revolutionary element's young age, "still has a future," "the composition is not too bad," etc., rather than according to the harm that the counter-revolutionary element has caused to the interests of the state and the people, to give the deserved punishment. Chairman Mao taught us: "All words and actions of Communists must conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and be supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." (On Coalition Government) We must also handle cases in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, starting from the interests of the broadest masses of the people, and not from other old legal viewpoints, etc. This is the fundamental viewpoint for handling all problems, and it must be firmly established in all public security and judicial cadres.

In addition, there are some comrades who have mistakenly treated counter-revolutionary elements and committed the fault of boundless leniency because of blindly fearing to repeat certain mistakes that have indeed been made in history, such as the "leftist" mistake of killing people without legal procedures in some places during the land reform. These comrades do not understand that our opposition to killing people without legal procedures must not lead us to abandon the legitimate responsibility of severely punishing counter-revolutionary elements according to law. As for what they are considering, it is only that individuals will be criticized and make mistakes. They do not know that leaving the interests of the state and the people to consider personal gains and losses is one of the root causes of making mistakes.

In short, because some cadres did not understand the policies of the Central People's Government clearly and completely, they opposed severely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities to consolidating the united front, opposed opposing random arrests and killings to severely punishing the ringleaders, and opposed suppression to leniency, causing the deviation of boundless leniency to fail to be overcome in time, and giving undue damage to the interests of the people. Now, the Chinese people are engaged in a sharp struggle with U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and at the same time invaded our country, threatening our country's security. Under this situation, hidden counter-revolutionary elements are eager to move and are stepping up their sabotage activities. This kind of sabotage activity has become an internal response to the U.S. aggressors, hindering the Chinese people from more effectively engaging in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country. Therefore, counter-revolutionary elements must be given resolute and severe suppression. This means that counter-revolutionary elements must be deprived of their political freedom and all conditions for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities must be deprived, so that they can only be honest and cannot talk nonsense or act recklessly. To this end, the deviation of boundless leniency must be completely eliminated in every link of public security and judicial work. Of course, it is also entirely necessary to take a cautious attitude in severely suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, to proceed with leadership and order, and to prevent possible left-leaning deviations.

All cadres and the people of the whole country should be highly vigilant, eliminate all complacent and paralyzed ideas, pay attention to preventing spies and special agents, and severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities. Every revolutionary cadre should firmly remember that maintaining a high degree of political vigilance at all times is the noble quality of a revolutionary cadre. Every revolutionary cadre should play a leading role and lead all the people to actively participate in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary activities, defend the security of the motherland, and effectively counter the imperialist aggression and the remnants of feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism.

### 彻底纠正曲解“宽大政策”的偏向

    彻底纠正曲解“宽大政策”的偏向
    中央人民政府政务院和最高人民法院今年七月会衔发布的镇压反革命活动指示在全国各省市执行以后，反革命分子已经受到沉重打击；存在于各地治安工作中曲解“宽大政策”的偏向或所谓“宽大无边”的偏向，已经有了基本上的纠正。但这个倾向还没有彻底地纠正。最近，中央与各大行政区、各省市的公安、司法领导机关，在现有成绩的基础上，对所谓“宽大无边”的偏向作了系统的检讨，拟订了彻底纠正这一偏向的计划，这对继续肃清反革命残余，巩固革命秩序，有很大的意义。从各地的检讨报告来看，曲解宽大政策的偏向是严重的，是带有相当普遍性的；因此，要从实际工作中，特别是从思想上彻底纠正这一偏向，使毛主席历来指示我们的镇压与宽大相结合的政策，亦即首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖的政策得到更好的贯彻，并不是一件轻而易举的事。
    各省的检讨报告说明，“宽大无边”偏向的主要表现，是对已经捕获的反革命首恶分子的判罪不够严厉和不够及时。例如，东北对密谋暗杀李兆麟将军的蒋匪保密局组长南守善，仅判以短期徒刑。新疆捕获的伪兰州二处技术课长刘永年，竟未判刑，轻率释放，而刘永年却是罪大恶极的分子，在兰州解放后，他还埋地雷一千六百个，并炸毁享堂桥。石家庄蒋匪特务机关“十九号”的审讯股长王钧，罪不容诛，羁押近三年之久，最近才作了处理。至于监狱管理制度，也不够严密，并且已因此造成若干犯人逃跑事件。
    这些现象的存在，曾助长了反革命分子的凶焰，并引起了人民群众的不满。有的特务分子竟公然说公安局是“公安店”，称法院为“司法旅馆”。人民群众觉得“政府宽大得没了门框”。甚至有些忠厚的老先生也看不过去，告戒我们：“能除暴安良者，万民才能归顺。”但是，在过去相当长的一段时间里，我们的一部分干部对于这些宽大无边的现象却熟视无睹，这究竟是什么原因呢？
    这是因为在胜利形势下面，一部分干部产生了严重的太平麻痹思想，对敌人所进行的隐蔽的破坏活动，失去了应有的警觉性。本来，这种思想在广大新区是不应该存在的；但是由于剿匪反特战线上的巨大胜利，已使革命秩序趋于稳定或巩固，于是也使一部分干部大意起来。这样，不论在老区，或者在新区，麻痹大意就成为一种带有普遍性的现象。有人觉得“特务已经被我们搞得差不多了”。他们忘记了即令在老区，依然还有不少潜藏的反革命分子，而在新区，我们在剿匪反特战线上的胜利，还只是基本上打垮了匪特的军事力量，即打垮了大股土匪，而隐蔽的特务组织，则还没有被彻底摧毁，而且大股土匪在受到摧毁性的打击之后，正在或者已经转变为分散的小股的隐蔽活动。对于这些基本情况认识不清楚的同志，只满足于已得的胜利。他们忘记了斯大林同志的伟大教言：“国家威力越增长，垂死阶级最后余孽的抵抗也就会愈猛烈。”（列宁主义问题第五二八页，一九四九年莫斯科版）他们忘记了毛主席所一再教导我们的：在公开的、有形的、拿枪的敌人被打倒之后，隐蔽的、无形的、不拿枪的敌人依然存在，而且“他们必然的要和我们作拼死的斗争”。有人虽然承认隐蔽的敌人依然存在，但是，他们觉得“几百万国民党匪军全给我们打败了，几个特务爪子没有什么了不起，成不了什么大事”。这种见解也是不对的。远在一九三七年三月斯大林同志就批判了这种错误见解，谆谆告戒不要因为反革命暗害分子人数很少而来安慰自己。他说：“为要实行捣乱，实行暗害，并不需要大批的人。为要建筑第列伯尔工程，是需要成千成万的工人，但要炸毁这一工程，也许至多只需要几十个人。为要打胜仗，是需要几军的红军，但为要在前线上破坏这一胜利，却只要在某个军部，甚至于只要在某个师部内有几个能偷出作战计划而交与敌军的侦探就够了。”（斯大林选集第五卷三○九页，东北新华书店版）这就是说，我们决不能仅从反革命分子的数量上来看问题，而应该从反革命分子可能给予国家与人民的危害上来看问题。
    其次，有一部分干部，存在着浓厚的旧的法律观点，他们不是按照毛主席的正确政策，不是按照共同纲领第七条的规定来办事，而是自己创造一套奇怪的“理论”，并且按照这套奇怪的“理论”来对待反革命分子。因此，有人认为“杀人放火是伪顽的一般行为”，似乎无关紧要。有的地方，认为反革命主谋分子“只是批准杀人的，不是执行的”，因此，“职务犯罪，不能处死”。而对杀人凶犯却又强调“他只是执行者，而不是主谋”。有的地方，把杀害人民公安人员的特务，当作“初犯”，而判以较轻的徒刑。有的地方，对阴谋组织暴乱未逞的特务，看成是一般的“未遂犯”，而不予以严办。有的地方，竟把土匪打死人民邮工的犯罪行为，解释为“自卫措施”，理由是邮工去捉土匪，土匪不能不“自卫”。这些糊涂的思想虽然是个别的，却是严重的，这不仅仅是思想糊涂，实在是立场模糊已极。另外有些干部，则存在着“教育万能”的思想，空谈“要有魄力改造坏人”。他们处理反革命案件时所依据的政策，不是镇压与宽大相结合的政策，而是不问罪恶大小，一律采取所谓“教育为主，惩办为辅”的方针。显然用不着说明，所有这些思想都是完全错误的。这些同志考虑问题的出发点，或者是旧的法律条文，或者是反革命分子个人的年龄还青，“还可能有前途”，“成份并不太坏”等等，而不是根据反革命分子所给予国家与人民利益的危害大小，来给以应得的惩处。毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论、行动，以是否合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，是否为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”（论联合政府）我们处理案件，也必须是按照毛主席的指示，从最广大人民群众的利益出发，而不能从别的什么旧的法律观点等等出发。这是处理一切问题的根本观点，必须在一切公安、司法干部中巩固地树立起来。
    此外，还有一部分同志，他们之所以错误地对待了反革命分子，犯了宽大无边的毛病，乃是因为盲目的惧怕重复历史上确曾犯过的某些错误，比方，土地改革期间在若干地方所曾发生过的不按法律手续杀人的“左”的错误。这些同志不了解我们反对不按法律手续的杀人，决不能因此就把依法严惩反革命分子的正当责任也放弃了。至于他们所考虑的，只是个人会受批评，会犯错误。他们不知道离开国家与人民的利益，来考虑个人的得失，正是犯错误的根源之一。
    总之，由于一部分干部没有清楚而完整地了解中央人民政府的政策，他们把严厉镇压反革命活动与巩固统一战线对立了起来，把反对乱捕乱杀与严惩首恶对立了起来，把镇压与宽大对立了起来，致使宽大无边的偏向未能及时克服，而给予人民利益以不应有的损害。现在，中国人民正与美帝国主义进行着尖锐斗争。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，同时侵略我国，威胁着我国的安全。在这种形势下面，潜藏的反革命分子蠢蠢欲动，正加紧进行破坏活动。这种破坏活动，又成为美国侵略者的内应，阻挠着中国人民更有效地从事抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争。因此，必须给予反革命分子以坚决而严厉的镇压。这就是说，必须剥夺反革命分子的政治自由，剥夺他们从事反革命活动的一切条件，使他们只能老老实实，不能乱说乱动。为此，必须在公安、司法工作的每一个环节中，把宽大无边的偏向扫除净尽。当然在严厉镇压反革命分子时采取谨慎态度，有领导、有秩序地进行，防止可能发生的左倾偏向也是完全必要的。
    全体干部和全国人民都应该高度警惕起来，清除一切太平麻痹观念，注意防奸防特，严厉镇压反革命活动。每一个革命干部都应该牢牢地记住：时刻保持高度的政治警觉性，乃是革命干部的高尚品质。每一个革命干部都应该发挥带头作用，带动全体人民积极参加镇压反革命活动的斗争，保卫祖国的安全，有效地回击帝国主义的侵略活动和封建主义官僚资本主义的残余。
