Introduction to Beijing Municipal Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School
	You Qiong

	Beijing Municipal Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School is the first new-type middle school established by the Beijing Municipality.

	The purpose of the Municipal People's Government in establishing the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School is to cultivate new-type intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds. It systematically and methodically admits worker and peasant cadres and workers who have completed primary school education, are between the ages of sixteen and thirty, and have participated in the revolution or worked in factories for more than three years. It provides them with basic cultural and scientific knowledge, enabling them to complete secondary education in a relatively short period (three years), qualify for admission to universities or specialized schools for further study, and become the backbone of national construction in the future.

	The school has 231 students, all of whom are worker and peasant cadres and workers from municipal-level organizations, as well as a small number of revolutionary soldiers. Among them, 160 are Communist Party members, and 49 are members of the Communist Youth League. Their participation in the revolution and length of service range from three to thirteen years. Twenty-nine of them are also factory record creators, combat heroes, and model workers. They are divided into four formal classes (157 people) and two preparatory classes (74 people) according to their educational level. The preparatory class lasts for one year. Generally, students have rich experience in struggle, so they have a relatively high level of political awareness and a strong understanding. Because they deeply felt the pain of low cultural level in the past work, since the start of classes on November 13, the enthusiasm for learning has been generally high. They often pursue the root of the problem and consciously work hard. The good order of classes and self-study surprised the teachers, who said, "I have been teaching for so many years, and I have never seen such conscious order." The students unanimously said, "We have been eager to learn for many years, and now that we have the opportunity, we must make good use of it." "We have not studied formally in the past, and our level is poor, but we are confident that we can catch up." The school provides each person with a set of study supplies, such as textbooks, teaching outlines, notebooks, pens, pencils, brushes, inkstones, and rulers. The notebooks and inkstones are marked with the words "Beijing Municipal Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School." The students were very moved and said, "The government cares about us so much, if we don't study hard, we will be sorry for the people."

	In terms of curriculum, the formal classes have seven subjects this semester: Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, botany, music, and physical education, with 29 class periods and 19 self-study periods per week. The preparatory classes have five subjects: Chinese, arithmetic, nature, music, and physical education, with 25 class periods and 24 self-study periods per week. The teaching materials are all textbooks compiled and edited uniformly by the Ministry of Education. The teaching method is based on the principle of integrating theory with practice, and more heuristic and object-based teaching methods are used. A unit test is held after each unit to check the teaching effect and gradually improve the teaching. Self-study has fixed content and is supervised by fixed teachers to answer questions at any time. In terms of students' life and ideological guidance, in addition to permeating political and ideological education into all subjects, various activities are also used to improve students' political awareness and strengthen organizational discipline to ensure good academic performance. The school also plans to hold an exam after a considerable period of time, and in combination with the usual understanding of the students, appropriately adjust the promotion and demotion between formal and preparatory classes.

	The school has a total of 30 faculty and staff members. Most of the 14 teachers are graduates of the "Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School Teacher Training Class" of the Normal University, and they have considerable teaching experience. Generally, they have a basic understanding of worker and peasant education and are determined to serve worker and peasant education. Many teachers reflected that they feel honored to participate in the work of this new type of school and are willing to study hard, transform and improve themselves in their work.

	In the movement of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Defending the Homeland," in addition to carrying out patriotic and internationalist political and ideological education in conjunction with relevant subjects, the school also organized current affairs reports, seminars, and discussions, held current affairs quizzes, and published wall newspapers and cartoons. The students actively wrote letters of condolence and donated condolence bags.

    北京市工农速成中学介绍
    有琼
    北京市工农速成中学是北京市立的第一个新型中学。
    市人民政府创办工农速成中学的目的，是为培养工农出身的新型知识分子，有计划、有步骤地吸收高小毕业文化程度，年龄在十六岁至三十岁之间，参加革命或在工厂工作三年以上的工农干部和工人入学，给以文化与科学基本知识的教育，使他们在较短时期（三年）内受完中等教育，具备条件升入大学或专门学校继续深造，将来成为国家建设的骨干人材。
    该校学员二百三十一人，都是市一级机关的工农干部和工人，还有小部分革命军人，其中有共产党员一百六十人，青年团员四十九人，参加革命年限和工龄三年到十三年不等。还有二十九人是工厂新纪录创造者，战斗英雄和模范工作者。按文化程度分为四个正式班（一五七人），两个预备班（七四人）。预备班期限为一年。一般学员都有丰富的斗争经验，故政治觉悟较高，理解力亦较强。由于过去工作中深切地感到文化水平低的痛苦，自十一月十三日上课以来，学习情绪普遍高涨，对问题常追根究底，自觉地努力用功。上课和自习秩序的良好，竟使教员感到惊讶地说：“教过这些年书，还没有看见过这么自觉的秩序。”同学们一致表示：“多少年来渴望着学习，今天有了机会，一定要好好地利用。”“我们过去没有正规地学习过，程度差，但是我们有信心，一定可以赶上。”学校发给每人一套学习用品，如课本、教材提纲、笔记本、钢笔、铅笔、毛笔、墨盒、橡皮、米突尺等，笔记本和墨盒上并有“北京市工农速成中学”的字样，同学们都非常感动地说：“政府这样关心我们，如果不好好学习，就对不起人民。”
    课程方面，本学期正式班有国文、算术、历史、地理、植物、音乐、体育等七门，每周上课二十九节，自习十九节；预备班有国文、算术、自然、音乐、体育等五门，每周上课二十五节，自习二十四节。教材一律采用由教育部统一编订的课本。教学方法，以贯彻理论与实际一致为原则，多用启发诱导与实物教学的方式。每单元结束后举行单元考试，检查教学效果，使教学逐步提高。自习有固定的内容，由固定的教员负责，以便随时解答问题。在学生生活与思想指导方面，除把政治思想教育渗透到各科教学中外，并通过各种活动提高学员的政治觉悟，加强组织性纪律性，保证学好功课。该校还打算在相当时期后举行一次考试，并结合平时对学员的了解再适当地进行正式班与预备班之间的升降调整。
    该校教职员工友共三十人，教员十四人中多半是师范大学“工农速成中学师资训练班”毕业的，有相当的教学经验，一般地对工农教育都有基本的认识，决心为工农教育服务。许多教员反映：能够参加这一新型学校的工作，感到光荣，愿意在工作中好好学习，改造并提高自己。
    在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的运动中，该校除结合有关科目进行爱国主义与国际主义的政治思想教育外，并组织了时事报告、座谈会、讨论会，举行了时事测验，并出刊了壁报和漫画；学员们都积极写慰问信捐慰问袋。
