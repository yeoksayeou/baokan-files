The People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, marking the great unity of the Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui nationalities and the internal unity of the Tibetan people in the Kangding area of Xikang Province, was officially established in Kangding on the 24th. 271 representatives of all ethnic groups attended the conference, including representatives from the Chinese Kangding Local Committee, the People's Liberation Army, Kangding's various organizations and groups, workers, farmers, herdsmen, industrialists, businessmen, freelancers, Tusi, Tuqianhu, Tubaihu, headmen, and religious representatives such as Living Buddhas, Khenpos, Geshis, and Lamas. Although the representatives attending the meeting had different customs, they were full of an atmosphere of unity and friendship. During the conference, through repeated discussions and exchanges of views in the general assembly group meetings, the political and ideological levels of the participating representatives were generally raised. The representatives unanimously adopted three major resolutions: "The Work Tasks of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province," "The Organizational Regulations of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province," and "The Unity Covenant of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province." They also approved the list of members of the Consultative Committee of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, sent a message of respect to the People's Liberation Army on the Kangzang Front, and a letter from the General Assembly to Tibetan compatriots. The establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Government is a concrete implementation of the Common Program of the CPPCC's ethnic policy. At the founding ceremony, the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group presented a flag to the newly established People's Government. Five thousand people from party, government, military, and school organizations in Kangding, as well as people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, and representatives attending the conference held a demonstration parade on November 25 to celebrate the establishment of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Regional Government and to launch a campaign to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and country.
