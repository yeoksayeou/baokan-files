    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, starting from November 25th, launched heroic counteroffensives against the American invading army on both the western and eastern fronts, defeating the enemy's so-called "general offensive" launched on November 24th. Currently, they are continuing to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy on the western front and encircling and annihilating the enemy on the eastern front. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have recovered six cities, including Bochuan, and are continuing to develop their offensive. This is a larger counteroffensive and a greater victory for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army following the victory of the counteroffensive against the enemy from October 24th to November 8th.
    The victory of the previous counteroffensive had already begun to transform the military situation in Korea and to frustrate the ferocity of the imperialist aggressors. The war giants of Wall Street, or MacArthur, the chief instigator of the Korean War, had long suffered from severe war hysteria. They insisted on crossing more than fifteen thousand miles of the Pacific Ocean to extend their aggressive "spear" towards the people of Asia, especially the people of Korea and China. Initially, they completely ignored the protests of our people against their aggressive crimes. They acted tyrannically in Korea, step by step approaching our border. When our people could no longer tolerate it, they formed a volunteer army and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, giving the arrogant enemy a head-on blow in the first round, causing them to retreat thirty miles. At this time, they began to feel that their aggressive war in Korea had a bleak future. However, when they had a chance to catch their breath, they went crazy again. MacArthur used "going home for Christmas" as bait to deceive his subordinates and launched the so-called "general offensive to end the war" on November 24th, again arrogantly rushing towards the Yalu River. This time, our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, filled with righteous indignation, launched a counteroffensive on the 25th, defeating the imperialists' arrogant plan again, and hitting them even harder than the previous time. Now the enemy on the western front is fleeing in complete disarray, being closely pursued and annihilated; the enemy on the eastern front is also being encircled and annihilated. But experience has shown that imperialists are unwilling to learn a lesson until their final defeat. If we do not resolutely sever the imperialist aggressors' "spear" and hope that they will automatically withdraw their "spear," that is absolutely impossible.
    However, imperialist aggressors should now learn from the continuous blows and failures they have suffered. They should recognize that our people's will and determination to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country are sacred and unshakable. All the slanders against the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's actions and the defamations against the Soviet Union by the imperialists and their lackeys are in vain. In today's world, there is no other country besides China that has more than a thousand miles of contiguous border with Korea, and the interdependent relationship between China and Korea is created by special historical and geographical conditions. The fact that the "tip of the spear" of the American aggressors is aimed not only at the people of Korea but also at the mainland of our country has long been fully confirmed by the actions of the American aggressors and the captured documents. Then, who can use what reason to oppose the Chinese people's voluntary action to resist America and aid Korea? We Chinese people fully know that our vital interests and the vital interests of the Korean people are inseparable. Therefore, the patriotic Chinese people have regarded the heroic struggle of their volunteer army as a life-and-death struggle related to the fundamental interests of our nation's survival. The Chinese people also regard supporting their volunteer army and the Korean People's Army's war of resistance against aggression as the unshirkable sacred duty of our 475 million compatriots. We must make the imperialists more clearly aware that the great Chinese people, who have won the revolution, absolutely cannot be lightly insulted. The Chinese people can most bravely and unreservedly sacrifice everything to defend their own and the Asian people's just cause. The Chinese people have also learned from the experience of long-term revolutionary struggle to distinguish between friends and enemies, and no provocation or discord can shake our beliefs.
    In the face of the Chinese people who are fighting for justice, all the deceptions and intimidation of the imperialist aggressors have long proven to be useless. However, every time the imperialist aggressors run into a wall, they cannot forget to adopt the futile means of deception and intimidation. Currently, the American aggressive war group is "particularly shocked" by the defeat of the American army in Korea, and the "atmosphere in the US government has suddenly become tense." From Truman and Acheson to several "congressmen," they have all made many hysterical remarks. These remarks can be roughly divided into two parts. One part is sweet talk and deception; the other part is flexing muscles and intimidation. The content of the deceptive part is nothing more than "stating that the United States has no intention of invading China," etc. This is naturally something that no one will believe, because the entire conspiracy plan of the United States to invade Korea and China has been completely exposed. The content of the intimidation part is nothing more than "a showdown with the CCP," "crossing the Manchurian border," "bombing Manchuria," "considering the use of atomic bombs," etc. These are also completely incapable of scaring the great Chinese people. Since our people are determined to resist American aggression through voluntary action, they are not afraid of anything. The more rampant and lawless the American aggressors become, the more they will anger the people of the world to rise up and attack them, and the faster the demise of imperialism will be.
    Now the imperialist invading army commanded by MacArthur is still awaiting the fate of a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield. Chinese and Korean people's heroes who bravely annihilate the enemy! All the people of Korea, all the people of China, all the people of Asia, and all the people of the world are watching your supremely glorious struggle with infinite respect. Advance bravely, advance, and advance again! Continue to strike the invaders, strike, and strike again! Only by resolutely severing the invaders' "spear" can the security of the motherland and world peace be guaranteed!

### 斩断帝国主义侵略的“长矛”

    斩断帝国主义侵略的“长矛”
    朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿部队，于十一月二十五日起，在西线和东线两个战场上，先后向美国侵略军举行了英勇的反攻，击溃了敌人于十一月二十四日发动的所谓“总攻势”，目前正继续追歼西线逃敌，并包围聚歼东线的敌人。朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿部队已收复了博川等六个城市，并继续发展攻势中。这是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队继十月二十四日至十一月八日对敌反攻取得胜利之后的一次更大的反攻和更大的胜利。
    前一次反攻的胜利，已经开始转变了朝鲜的军事形势，开始挫折了帝国主义侵略者的凶焰；这一次反攻所已得的胜利，显然已确定地转变了朝鲜的军事形势，确定地挫折了帝国主义侵略者猖狂的凶焰。
    帝国主义侵略者总是不善于接受教训的。华尔街的战争巨头，或者是侵朝战争的总头目麦克阿瑟，很久以来就都已经患了战争歇斯底里的严重病症。他们硬要横越一万五千余里的太平洋，向着亚洲人民，特别是向着朝鲜和中国的人民，伸出侵略的“长矛”。他们最初完全无视我国人民对于他们的侵略罪行所发出的抗议呼声。他们在朝鲜横行霸道，向我国边境步步逼来。及至我国人民忍无可忍，组成了志愿部队，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，第一回合就给了张牙舞爪的敌人以迎头打击，使他们溃退三十英里。这时候，他们才开始感觉到他们在朝鲜的侵略战争前途渺茫。但是，当他们稍有喘息的机会，他们就又疯狂起来了。麦克阿瑟以“回家过圣诞节”为欺骗其部下的香饵，在十一月二十四日又发动了所谓“结束战争的总攻”，又张牙舞爪地向鸭绿江扑来。这一次，我人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，义愤填膺，从二十五日起即举行反攻，把帝国主义者狂妄的计划又击败了，而且比前一次打击得更痛。现在西线的敌人全线溃逃，正被紧紧地追歼着；东线的敌人也正被围歼中。但是经验证明，帝国主义者不到最后失败总是不愿意接受教训的。如果我们不坚决起来斩断帝国主义侵略的“长矛”，而希望他们自动收起他们的“长矛”，那是绝对不可能的。
    但是，帝国主义侵略者现在应该从他们连续遭受打击和失败中取得教训了。应该认识我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿和决心是神圣不可动摇的了。帝国主义者及其走狗所进行的一切对于中国人民志愿行动的诬蔑和对于苏联的诽谤都是枉费心机的。在今天的世界上，除了中国以外，再没有第二个国家与朝鲜有一千多里毗连的国境，中朝两国唇齿相依的关系是特殊的历史和地理条件所造成的。而美国侵略者的“长矛之尖”，不但是针对着朝鲜的人民，而且是针对着我国大陆的这个事实，也早已经由美国侵略者的行动和被缴获的文件所完全证实了。那末，谁还能够用什么理由来反对中国人民抗美援朝的志愿行动呢？我们中国人民完全知道我们的切身利害和朝鲜人民的切身利害是不可分的。因此，中国爱国人民已经把自己的志愿部队的英勇斗争，看成了关系我国民族存亡的根本利益的生死斗争。中国人民更把支援自己的志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的反侵略战争，当成了我国四万七千五百万同胞义不容辞的神圣责任。我们要让帝国主义者更清楚地认识，革命胜利了的伟大中国人民，是绝对不容轻侮的。中国人民能够最勇敢地不顾一切牺牲地保卫自己和亚洲人民的正义事业。中国人民也从长期革命斗争的经验中学会分清敌友，任何挑拨离间都不足以动摇我们的信念。
    在为正义而斗争的中国人民面前，帝国主义侵略者的一切欺骗和恫吓早已证明是毫无作用的了。但是，帝国主义侵略者每当碰壁之后，总不能忘怀于采取徒劳无功的欺骗和恫吓的手段。目前美国侵略战争集团又因美军在朝鲜的战败而“特别感到震惊”，美国政府中“空气顿时紧张”了。从杜鲁门、艾奇逊以至于若干“议员”，都发表了许多歇斯底里的议论。这些议论，大体可以分为两部分。一部分是甜言蜜语的欺骗；一部分是磨拳擦掌的恫吓。属于欺骗的部分，其内容无非是“申述美国没有侵略中国的意图”等等。这自然是谁也不会相信了的，因为美国侵略朝鲜和中国的全部阴谋计划都已经暴露无遗了。属于恫吓的部分，其内容也不外是“向中共摊牌”、“越过满洲边界”、“轰炸满洲”、“考虑原子弹的使用”等等。这些也是完全不是以吓倒伟大的中国人民的。我国人民既然决心以志愿行动，抵抗美国的侵略，那就是什么也不怕了的。无法无天的美国侵略者愈加疯狂，就愈加触怒全世界人民群起而攻之，帝国主义的灭亡也就更快了。
    现在麦克阿瑟所指挥的帝国主义侵略军，在朝鲜战场上还在等待着惨败的命运。勇猛歼敌的中国和朝鲜的人民英雄们！全朝鲜的人民，全中国的人民，全亚洲的人民和全世界的人民，都正在以无限的敬意注视着你们的绝顶光荣的奋斗。勇敢地前进，前进，再前进！继续给侵略者以打击，打击，再打击！只有坚决斩断侵略者的“长矛”，祖国的安全与世界和平才有保障！
