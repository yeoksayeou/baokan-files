    Shenyang, December 18 (By our Special Correspondent, Liu Keming, Production Minister of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions) The anti-American, aid-Korea patriotic production emulation drive, vividly and enthusiastically demonstrating the working class's patriotic will, has brought an unprecedented surge in production to hundreds of public and private enterprises in Shenyang. Thanks to the united cooperation of workers and technicians, and the research and improvement of technology, many units and individuals have achieved astonishing results. In the competition, more than 3,500 advanced producers and more than 480 advanced production teams have emerged, and they are a vital force for consolidating and further promoting the competition. In the past two months, the competition movement in Shenyang has developed extremely rapidly, completely changing the past phenomenon where "workers move, but staff and technicians do not move" in the competition. According to statistics from early December, 254 factories and enterprises (202 public and 52 private) under 20 industrial trade unions in the city have launched competitions, with 90,000 people participating. The number of participants in state-owned enterprises accounts for 87% of the total number of employees. More than 80% of the total number of technicians and staff in state-owned enterprises participated in the competition.

    Technicians and staff show great enthusiasm in the competition.

    In the competition, many technicians and staff showed great enthusiasm. Half of the technicians at the Automobile General Factory went to the front line during the crash task competition; Zhou Baichen, a technician at the 53rd Factory, worked with his colleagues to study and transform the copper material mold, saving more than two tons of copper material every month; Fan Wentong, Yang Honggui, and other technicians at the Electrical Engineering First Factory worked with their colleagues to study and improve the method of using crucibles for melting magnets. The magnet task in November was completed 17 days ahead of schedule, and costs were reduced by more than 200 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below); Wu Hongshun, a technician at the Electrical Engineering Seventh Factory, improved the copper melting furnace, doubling the amount of copper melted, and paid attention to researching and saving losses, reducing the loss rate from 4.7% to 3.07%, and increasing the product qualification rate from 88.5% to 94.6%; Liang Lai, an engineer at the hardening oil plant of the Chemical Factory, developed a direct hardening operation method, shortening the production process; engineer Kuai Yi of the Dye Factory studied how to reduce the amount of mixed acid added, reducing the manufacturing cost of sulfur blue, saving 2.3 billion yuan in November. Staff members of the Chemical Factory, Clothing First Factory, Dyeing and Finishing Factory, and Shenyang Weaving Factory all calculated costs in advance, greatly improving work efficiency; Wu Haoran, a staff member of the Dyeing and Finishing Factory, improved the method of opening dye drums, increasing the value of empty drums and saving the state 150 million yuan.

    A large number of advanced producers and advanced units promoted the competition and accelerated the production process.

    A large number of advanced producers, advanced groups, and advanced departments have emerged in the competition. According to statistics from 171 factories in November, there were 3,583 advanced producers (including 362 female advanced producers), 488 advanced production teams, and 71 advanced sections, offices, and departments. Liu Jingguan's team at the Rubber Fourth Factory seized on the shortcomings of excessive downtime in their group as the main goal of the competition, launched a competition between individuals based on individual planning, and regularly checked and summarized, and promptly praised and criticized. As a result, the output exceeded the competition plan by 39%, eliminated defective products, and reduced the rate of return repairs from 1% to 0.47%. The cutting group of the shoe upper workshop took thrift as the goal of the competition. Because a responsibility system was established in the group, a thrift comparison table was established, and the cutting operation method to save money was studied every noon. One month saved 121 bolts of cloth, a total savings of more than 400 million yuan. The laboratory of the Smelting Plant, due to mastering the key of this department, put forward the requirements of improving the accuracy of analysis and reducing the error rate, and established an inspection system and propaganda and mobilization work, so that the error rate of ore crude copper dropped from 2% to 1%, and individual comrades dropped to 0.5%, which greatly improved the accuracy of the work and met the requirements of the site. In the competition, workers' inventions and creations improved technology a lot. For example, the Dyeing and Finishing Factory created and improved a total of ten technologies in the competition, and the Third Workshop of the Automobile General Factory improved and created fifteen technologies.

    Due to the enthusiastic participation of the vast number of workers, technicians, and staff, the leadership and promotion of advanced producers, advanced groups, and departments, the patriotic emulation accelerated the production process, ensuring the completion and surpassing of national production tasks, especially national temporary tasks. Quality and attendance have been further improved. For example, according to the statistics of the 18 factories under the Mechanical Engineering Trade Union, 16 factories had completed and exceeded the national production plan in November. Among them, the Nail Factory exceeded the November planned task by 13.488%. In addition, it also completed the crash task ahead of schedule. The attendance rate increased from 95.86% in October to 98.33%. The temporary production tasks of the Automobile General Factory were all completed ahead of schedule; the state-owned factories under the Chemical Industry Trade Union, such as dyes, paints, hardened oil, electrolysis, and oil plants, all exceeded their tasks; the factories under the Light Industry Trade Union generally exceeded their tasks. For example, the quality of the Rubber Seventh Factory in October increased by 25.66% compared with September, and in November it increased by 33% compared with September. The quality requirement was 98%, and it increased to 99.115% in October and 99.646% in November. The Rubber Fifth Factory exceeded the task by 72.88%. The average attendance rate of the fourteen factories in the Electrical Engineering Industry Trade Union reached 97%. The Mining Machinery Repair Factory had never completed its tasks in the past. After the competition, the output in November exceeded 25%.

    Current shortcomings and corrective measures.

    Although the scope of this patriotic production competition movement is very broad and the achievements are very great, it is not yet consolidated. The main manifestations are in the following aspects:

    1. The combination of competition and strengthening business management is not enough. Some units did not plan well in the competition, ignored quality, disregarded costs, and increased accidents. For example, in some factories, quality inspection was ignored in emergency tasks, resulting in return repairs accounting for 40%; accidents in some units increased in November compared with October. 2. Viewing the competition as a temporary crash. Under high enthusiasm, some units' employees carried out intensive crash programs, worked overtime, and dedicated their labor. In order to maintain attendance, they did not ask for leave when something happened, or even went to work while sick. Not enough attention has been paid to how to protect this high level of labor enthusiasm, promptly pay attention to labor protection, and appropriately solve wage and reward issues. 3. Competition plans generally have the problem of being generalized, having too many clauses, and having unclear competition goals; 4. The organization and leadership of the competition lags behind the requirements of the movement. The trade union organization and leadership cannot keep up with the movement. Generally, the masses move, but a few cadres above move. How the trade union committee and various working committees play an organizational role around the competition is still very poor.

    The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a conference on December 9 to summarize the experience of the Shenyang patriotic production competition. It also pointed out that it is necessary to further deepen leadership, consolidate achievements, and correct shortcomings to make the movement more in-depth. To this end, 1. The direction of the movement should be clearly guided to strengthen business management, improve technology, improve operation methods and labor organization, promote technical learning, and vigorously promote advanced experience to ensure the completion and surpassing of national production tasks and all temporary tasks. In completing and exceeding tasks, attention should be paid to ensuring and improving quality, reducing costs, and reducing accidents. Consolidate the enthusiasm of technicians and staff to widely participate in the competition, promote their advanced experience, and organize technical learning in many ways. Improve business management methods and give full play to their abilities and roles. 2. Strengthen the organization and leadership of the competition. The first is to correctly formulate a competition plan. The competition conditions should be concise and specific, and should be combined with the production situation of the unit. There should be requirements and methods. The competition plan only needs to include the main items related to production, and the guarantee methods can appear in the form of a covenant in the group, and it is not necessary to subscribe to the entire competition plan. The inspection standards should be based on the competition plan and the production level that has been reached. They should also be concise, with emphasis, and should not be cumbersome and without a center. In terms of inspection methods, in addition to organizing regular inspection summaries, it is also emphasized that the inspection organization should be combined with production meetings. Inspection summaries must be reported at the production meeting and mobilize employees to discuss, criticize, exchange experience, and improve work. 3. In order to protect the patriotic labor enthusiasm, we must pay special attention to labor protection work at present, and appropriately solve wage and reward issues. 4. The trade union organization should further play its role. The first thing is to rectify and improve the various tasks of the workshop trade union. The most important thing at present is to exchange work experience. Therefore, we should vigorously summarize the typical experience of grassroots trade unions and working committees and promote them so that grassroots trade union cadres can learn methods. Related to this is how the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League should specifically divide their labor and cooperate in the competition. Only by solving this problem can the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cooperate closely and move in unison, and the competition can be carried out more powerfully.

    In addition, the competition among public and private factories and enterprises is still unbalanced. Although the competition in private enterprises has been initially launched, most of them have not yet participated in the competition. In the future, we should vigorously mobilize private enterprises to launch competitions.

    沈阳市爱国生产竞赛成绩辉煌            
    运动中涌现三千余名先进生产者
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员、沈阳市总工会生产部长刘克明报道：鲜明地热情蓬勃地表现了工人阶级爱国意志的抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛，给沈阳市的数百个公、私营企业带来前所未有的生产高涨。由于工人、技术人员的团结合作，研究改进技术，很多单位和个人创造了惊人的成绩。在竞赛中已涌现了三千五百多个先进生产者和四百八十多个先进生产小组，他们又是巩固和进一步推动竞赛的有生力量。两个多月来，沈市的竞赛运动开展极为迅速，已完全改变了过去在竞赛中“工人动，职员、技术人员不动”的现象。据十二月初的统计：全市已有二十个产业工会所属二百五十四个工厂、企业（其中公营二百零二个，私营五十二个）开展了竞赛，参加竞赛人数已达九万人。国营企业参加竞赛人数为全体职工总数的百分之八十七。技术人员职员参加竞赛的已达全体国营企业技术人员职员总数的百分之八十以上。
    技术人员、职员在竞赛中热情极高
    在竞赛中，许多技术人员与职员显示了极高热情。汽车总厂突击任务竞赛中半数技术人员下现场；五三工厂技术员周柏臣与工友共同研究改造压铜料模子，每月节省铜料两吨多；电工一厂樊文通、杨洪贵等技术员与工友共同研究改进熔化磁铁坩埚使用方法，十一月份磁铁任务提前十七天完成，并降低成本两亿余元（东北币，下同）；电工七厂技术员吴鸿顺改进熔铜炉，增加熔铜量一倍，并注意研究节省损耗，损失率由百分之四点七降低到百分之三点○七，产品合格率由百分之八十八点五，提高到百分之九十四点六；化工厂硬化油场梁濑工程师研究出直接硬化操作法，缩短了生产程序；染料厂蒯毅工程师研究降低混酸加水量，使硫化青制造成本降低，十一月份节省二十三亿元。化工厂、被服一厂、染整厂、沈阳织布厂等职员均提前算出成本，大大提高了工作效率；染整厂职员吴浩然改进染料桶打盖方法，使空桶增加价值，为国家节省一亿五千万元。
    大批先进生产者和先进单位推动了竞赛，加速了生产进程
    竞赛中涌现出大批先进生产者、先进小组、先进科室。据十一月份一百七十一个厂的统计，已出现先进生产者三千五百八十三人（内有女先进生产者三百六十二人），先进生产小组四百八十八个，先进科、股、室七十一个。橡胶四厂刘景贯小组抓住本组停修时间过多的缺点作为竞赛的主要目标，在个人订计划基础上展开个人与个人的竞赛，定期检查总结，及时表扬批评，结果产量超过竞赛计划百分之三十九，消灭了废品，退修品由百分之一降低到百分之○点四七。制帮间裁断组以节约作为竞赛奋斗目标，由于在小组中建立了责任制度，建立了节约比较表，每天中午研究如何节约的裁剪操作方法，一月节省布一百二十一匹，共节省四亿余元。冶炼厂化验室由于掌握了本部门的关键，提出提高分析准确度，降低误差率的要求，并建立了检查制度及宣传鼓动工作，使矿石粗铜的误差率由百分之二降到百分之一，个别同志降低到百分之○点五，大大提高了工作精确性，满足了现场的要求。在竞赛中工人的发明创造改进技术也很多，如染整厂竞赛中创造改进技术共十种，汽车总厂第三车间改进技术创造十五种。
    由于广大工人、技术人员、职员热烈参加竞赛，先进生产者、先进小组、部门的带头及推动，爱国主义竞赛加速了生产进程，保证了国家生产任务特别是国家临时任务的完成与超过。质量和出勤率已进一步提高。如机械工会所属十八个工厂的统计，十一月份已有十六个厂完成与超过国家生产计划。其中如制钉厂全厂共超过十一月份计划任务百分之十三点四八八，此外并提前完成了突击任务。出勤率由十月份百分之九十五点八六，提高到百分之九十八点三三。汽车总厂临时生产任务均提前完成；化工工会所属国营工厂如染料、油漆、硬化油、电解、制油厂等均超过任务；轻工业工会所属各厂一般均超过任务，如橡胶七厂质量十月份较九月份提高百分之二十五点六六，十一月份较九月份又提高百分之三十三，质量要求为百分之九十八，十月份提高到百分之九十九点一一五，十一月份提高到百分之九十九点六四六。橡胶五厂超过任务百分之七十二点八八。电工产业工会中十四个厂出勤率平均达百分之九十七。矿山机械修理厂过去从未完成任务，竞赛后，十一月份产量即超过了百分之二十五。
    目前存在的缺点和改正办法
    这次爱国生产竞赛运动范围虽然很广，竞赛成绩虽然很大，但还不巩固。主要地表现在以下几个方面：
    一、竞赛与加强经营管理方针结合不够，有些单位在竞赛中计划不周，忽视质量，不计成本，事故增加。如有的厂在紧急任务中，忽视质量检查，以至退修品占百分之四十；有些单位十一月份竞赛较十月份事故增加了。二、把竞赛看成突击一时。有些单位职工在高度热情下，紧张突击，加班加点，献工，为坚持出勤，有事不请假，或甚至带病上班。对于如何爱护这种高度劳动热情，及时注意劳动保护，适当解决工资及奖励问题，注意得还不够。三、竞赛计划普遍有一般化、条文过多、竞赛目标不明确的毛病；四、竞赛的组织领导落后于运动的要求，工会组织领导赶不上运动，一般情况是群众动，上面少数干部动，工会委员会及各个工作委员会如何围绕竞赛发挥组织作用，做得还很差。
    沈市总工会于十二月九日召开大会，总结了沈市爱国主义生产竞赛的经验。并指出必需进一步深入领导，巩固成绩，纠正缺点，使运动更加深入一步。为此，一、运动的方向应明确引向加强经营管理、改进技术、改善操作法及劳动组织、提倡技术学习、大力推广先进经验，以保证完成与超过国家生产任务与一切临时任务。在完成与超过任务中要注意保证与提高质量、降低成本、减少事故。要巩固技术人员、职员广泛参加竞赛的热情，推广他们的先进经验，并多方面的组织技术学习。改进经营管理方法，充分发挥他们的能力与作用。二、加强竞赛的组织领导。首先是正确地制定竞赛计划。竞赛条件要简明、具体，要结合本单位生产情况，要有要求、有办法。竞赛计划中只包括有关生产的主要几条即可，保证办法可以于小组中以公约形式出现，不必全订在竞赛计划中。检查标准要根据竞赛计划及已达到的生产水平来订，也要简明，有重点，不要条文繁琐，没有中心。检查方法上，除去要定期组织检查总结外，并强调检查组织要与生产会议结合。检查总结必须在生产会议上报告，并发动职工讨论，开展批评，交流经验，改进工作。三、为了爱护爱国主义的劳动热情，目前要特别注意劳动保护工作，并要适当地解决工资及奖励问题。四、工会组织要进一步发挥作用，首先要整顿与健全车间工会的各种工作。目前最主要的是交流工作经验。因此，应大力总结基层工会及工作委员会典型经验加以推广，使工会基层干部学到办法，与此相联系的是党、政、工、团如何在竞赛中具体分工合作问题也须解决。只有解决这一问题，党、政、工、团才能密切配合，步调一致，竞赛才能更进一步地有力地开展。
    此外，公、私工厂企业竞赛开展仍不平衡，私营企业竞赛虽已初步开展，但绝大部分尚未参加竞赛，今后应大力发动私营企业展开竞赛。
