    Suppressing Special Agents Under the Guise of Secret Societies
    Six Bandits Executed by Firing Squad in Xuzhou
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st] The Xuzhou Municipal People's Court has lawfully sentenced the bandit "China People's Self-Rescue Army" armed special agent organization case, which conducted special agent activities under the guise of feudal secret societies. The principal offenders Li Huatang, Liu Jiyuan, Zhang Tiquan, Liu Xuelun, Liu Fuxun, and Tang Shan, among others, were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in Xuzhou on November 19th; the remaining offenders were sentenced to imprisonment or released after education, depending on the severity of their crimes.
    Bandit Li Huatang was a special agent of Chiang Kai-shek's "Military Intelligence Bureau," and as early as 1946 he served as the leader of the fifth group of the second division of the bandit "Suppression Headquarters." Using the feudal superstitious slogan of "All Ways Lead to One," this bandit won over and commanded feudal secret societies in more than ten counties around Xuzhou and in northern Anhui, southern Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. Under the bandit "China People's Self-Rescue Army" banner, he organized counter-revolutionary armed forces, plotting to besiege our district and township people's governments, seize weapons, and loot warehouses. Bandit Li also instructed subordinate special agents to incite secret society members, and successively organized seven riots in Xinhuailian in Shandong, Huoshan and Suxian in northern Anhui, and other places.
    Bandit Liu Jiyuan was formerly the "Director of the Military Supply Department" of Chiang Kai-shek's army stationed in Xuzhou. After the liberation of Xuzhou, under the instructions of Bandit Li Huatang, this bandit organized feudal secret society riots in Xiaoxian and Mengcheng in northern Anhui, causing great damage to the local people. Bandit Liu, together with Zhang Tiquan and 18 others, besieged the township people's governments of Chongtun, Liuzhai, and Huzhai in Xiaoxian on the night of April 27th last year, killing more than ten of our township chiefs and lower-level personnel.
    Bandit Zhang Tiquan was the leader of the "Red Flag Society," a feudal secret society. He led armed special agents to attack our township people's government on several occasions, resulting in a total of 26 casualties among our cadres. Liu Xuelun, Liu Fuxun, Tang Shan, and others were also special agent bandits with notorious crimes, looting, burning, and killing in northern Anhui, southern Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, and were deeply hated by the local people.
    In April of this year, the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested all the bandits involved in the case and seized radio stations, firearms, and many documents. After being transferred to the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court for interrogation, the criminals, with all the evidence against them, had no choice but to confess their crimes. The Xuzhou Municipal People's Court then sentenced the six criminals to death according to law, and they were executed by firing squad in Xuzhou on November 19th.

    镇压以会道门掩护活动的特务
    徐州枪决匪犯六名
    【新华社济南一日电】徐州市人民法院已依法判决以封建会道门为掩护进行特务活动的匪“中国人民自救军”武装特务组织案。主犯李华堂、刘继元、张体权、刘学伦、刘傅训、唐山等六匪，判处死刑，并已于十一月十九日在徐州执行枪决；余犯按罪行轻重分别判处徒刑或教育后释放。
    李匪华堂是蒋匪“军统”特务，一九四六年即任匪“剿总”二处五组组长。该匪以“万道归一”的封建迷信口号，笼络并指挥徐州周围和皖北、鲁南、苏北等地十余县的封建会道门，以匪“中国人民自救军”番号组织反革命武装，阴谋围袭我区、乡人民政府，夺取武器，抢劫仓库。李匪并指示所属特务，煽惑会道门分子，先后在山东新海连、皖北霍山、宿县等地组织七次暴动。
    刘匪继元原系蒋匪军驻徐州的“军需处主任”。徐州解放后，该匪在李匪华堂指示下，曾在皖北萧县、蒙城等地组织封建会道门暴动，使当地人民遭受很大损害。刘匪又曾与张匪体权等十八人，于去年四月二十七日夜围袭萧县崇屯、刘寨、胡寨三个乡人民政府，杀死我乡长以下十余人。
    张匪体权是封建会道门“红旗会”的头目，曾先后率领武装特务袭击我乡人民政府，共伤亡我干部二十六人。刘学伦、刘傅训、唐山等，也都是罪恶昭著的特务匪徒，在皖北、鲁南、苏北一带抢劫烧杀，早为当地人民痛恨入骨。
    今年四月，徐州市人民政府公安局将该案各匪犯捕获，并缴获电台、枪支及证件多件。经移送徐州市人民法院予以审讯，该犯等以罪证俱在，不得不低头认罪，供出所犯罪行。徐州市人民法院遂依法判处该六犯死刑，并已于十一月十九日在徐州市执行枪决。
