    Zhi Gong Party and Jiusan Society Issue Statements
    Opposing US Imperialism's Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The China Zhi Gong Party and the Jiusan Society have separately issued statements opposing the US imperialist scheme of a separate peace treaty with Japan.
    The China Zhi Gong Party's statement said: "US imperialism is attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, absorb the reactionary Japanese government into the United Nations, and occupy Japan for a long time, using Japan as a tool for the US to invade Korea, China, and other Asian countries. This is absolutely intolerable to our patriotic compatriots nationwide. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of December 4th. The peace treaty with Japan must be based entirely on the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947, drafted by the foreign ministers of our Central People's Government and the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and maintain the principle of great power consensus. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no matter its steps, content, or results, it will be illegal and invalid."
    The Jiusan Society's statement briefly stated: "More than five years have passed since Japan's surrender. Because the US imperialists monopolize control over Japan, undermine the process of the four foreign ministers' meeting to draft the peace treaty with Japan and the principle of great power consensus, manipulate the peace conference with Japan, and even妄想exclude the new China and the Soviet Union, which have made the greatest sacrifices and contributions in the war against Japan, in order to carry out a separate peace treaty. On the 4th of this month, our Foreign Minister issued a statement refuting this arrogant attempt by the US imperialists, and asserted that any peace treaty with Japan that is not prepared, drafted, and signed with the participation of the People's Republic of China will be illegal and invalid. Our society pledges to do everything in its power to firmly support this just statement."

    致公党及九三学社分别发表声明
    反对美帝单独对日媾和
    【本报讯】中国致公党及九三学社分别发表声明，反对美帝单独对日媾和阴谋。
    中国致公党的声明称：美帝国主义企图与日本单独媾和，吸收日本反动政府参加联合国，并长期占领日本，利用日本作为美国侵略朝鲜、中国以及亚洲其他国家的工具。这是我全国爱国同胞所决不能容忍的。我们坚决拥护十二月四日周恩来外长的声明。对日和约必须完全以开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会通过的对投降后日本的基本政策为基础，由我中央人民政府及苏、美、英四国外长进行草拟，并保持大国一致原则。如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其步骤、内容和结果如何，一概是非法的，无效的。
    九三学社的声明中略称：日本投降，已五年余。因美帝国主义者独占对日管制，破坏四外长会议起草对日和约程序与大国一致原则，操纵对日和会，甚至妄想排斥对日作战牺牲最大、贡献最多的新中国与苏联参加，来进行单独媾和。本月四日，我国外长曾发表声明，将美帝这种狂妄企图予以驳斥，并主张非有中华人民共和国参加准备、拟制与签订的对日和约，将属非法与无效。本社誓竭全力坚决拥护这一正义的声明。
