    Regarding the Issue of Purchasing Agricultural Products on Credit

    Editor:
    This year, the sales of cotton, grain, and native products in various regions are sluggish. The state-owned trading companies are not purchasing as much as in the past, and the prices of agricultural products are falling, causing considerable losses to farmers. This will affect farmers' enthusiasm for future production. It is said that the government is now adopting a method of purchasing surplus agricultural products from farmers on credit. What is this all about?
    Reader Wang Desheng

    Comrade Wang Desheng:
    The question you raised is a major one. The government is very concerned about this issue.
    Originally, the national financial and economic plan for this year had decided to invest a larger amount of funds in state-owned trade and to assist cooperatives in purchasing agricultural and sideline products to increase farmers' purchasing power, invigorate the market, and connect urban and rural trade. This would be very beneficial to both the urban and rural economies. However, since American imperialism expanded its war of aggression against Korea, the flames of war have reached the doorstep of our motherland, and American imperialism is actively expanding its preparations for a war of aggression. Under these circumstances, we must focus on strengthening national defense to protect our country.
    In order to strengthen national defense and at the same time stabilize finance and prices, expenditures in other areas must be reduced. The original plan for large-scale procurement of agricultural and sideline products had to be changed.
    Of course, reducing the procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products is unfavorable to farmers and to the entire social economy. Under these unavoidable circumstances, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives decided to adopt the method of purchasing on credit.
    "Purchasing on credit" means selling farmers' agricultural and sideline products to state-owned trading companies and cooperatives using a temporary account system. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives will then periodically pay farmers with the industrial products or cash they need. The state-owned trading companies and cooperatives are responsible for guaranteeing the principal and value of the agricultural and sideline products sold by the farmers. After the purchase on credit, if the price of agricultural and sideline products falls, the state-owned trading companies and cooperatives will still return the value based on the market price at the time of the purchase on credit. If the price rises, it will be calculated according to the increased price. This is called listening to increases but not listening to decreases. This approach protects the interests of farmers on the one hand and invigorates the market on the other. Under normal circumstances, most of the farmers' agricultural products are harvested in the autumn. In addition to taking out a portion of these agricultural products to exchange for regular items (such as oil, salt, etc.), farmers also need to take out a portion to exchange for seasonal items (such as fertilizers, etc.). When the season has not yet arrived, farmers do not need to exchange for seasonal items, so a portion of the agricultural products must be stored. However, farmers have to bear the risk of falling prices and the difficulty of preserving agricultural products. Now, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives purchase this portion of agricultural products on credit, and when farmers need seasonal items, they return the items (or cash) to the farmers according to the principle of guaranteeing principal and value. This is very convenient for farmers.
    The work of purchasing agricultural and sideline products on credit should be mainly the responsibility of cooperatives. After the cooperatives purchase agricultural products on credit, they first exchange them among themselves, which drives extensive material exchanges. At present, cooperatives in five provinces and two cities in North China have formulated many methods for purchasing agricultural products on credit. In the future, these methods can be promoted throughout the country.
    However, China is a large agricultural country with very abundant agricultural and sideline products. Therefore, in addition to relying on the procurement and purchase on credit by state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, it is also necessary to organize a large number of private merchants to carry out procurement work under the leadership of the national economy.

### 关于农产品的赊购问题

    关于农产品的赊购问题编者同志：
    今年各地棉、粮、土产销路不畅，国营贸易公司收购不如过去之多，农产品落价，农民颇受损失。这样会影响农民今后生产情绪。据说现在政府采取赊购办法收购农民剩余生产品，是怎样一回事情？
    读者王德胜王德胜同志：
    你所提的问题是一个大问题。政府对这个问题是很关心的。
    本来，今年国家财政经济计划中，曾经决定以较大资金投资于国营贸易，并帮助合作社，收购农产品和农副产品，以增加农民购买力，活跃市场，沟通城乡贸易，这样对于城乡经济都是很有利的。但自美帝国主义扩大侵朝战争之后，战争的烽火燃烧到了祖国的大门，而且美帝国主义正积极地扩大侵略战争的准备。在这种情形下，我们不能不着重加强国防建设，来保卫我们的国家。
    为了加强国防建设，同时又要稳定金融物价，因此，其他方面的支出不能不缩减。原定的较大的农产品收购计划，不能不变更。
    当然，缩小农产品及农副产品的收购计划，对农民对整个社会经济都是不利的。在这种不得已情况下，国营贸易公司和合作社才决定采用赊购办法。
    “赊购”就是把农民的农产品和农副产品用暂时欠账的方法卖给国营贸易公司和合作社，国营贸易公司和合作社则定期付给农民所需要的工业品或现款；对农民售出的农产品和农副产品负责保本保值。赊购之后，如果农产品和农副产品落价，国营贸易公司和合作社仍按照赊购时的市价作价归还。如果价格涨了，就照涨了的价格算。这叫做听涨不听落。这种作法，一方面保护了农民利益；另一方面也活跃了市场。一般情形下，农民的农产品大部分是秋季下来的，农民把这些农产品除了拿出一部分交换经常性的物品（如油、盐等），还要拿出一部分交换季节性的物品（如肥料等）。当季节未到来时，农民是不需要交换季节性的物品的，那么有一部分农产品就要存放起来，但农民又要负担农业品落价和保存困难的危险。现在国营贸易公司和合作社把这部分农产品以赊购办法收购，到了农民需要季节性的物品时，根据保本保值的价格原则，把物品（或现款）归还农民，这对于农民是非常便利的。
    赊购农产品和农副产品的工作，主要应由合作社负责。合作社把农产品赊购之后，首先在社与社之间互相交换，这就带动广大物资交流。目前华北五省二市的合作社已经定出赊购农产品的许多办法。将来这些办法可以推行各地。
    但是中国是一个大农业国，农产品和农副产品十分丰富。因此除了依靠国营贸易公司和合作社的收购和赊购外，还需要在国家经济领导下，组织广大私商进行收购工作。
