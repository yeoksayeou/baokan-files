    Strengthening the Mass Perspective in News Reporting
    (Qian Danhui, *Wan Nan Daily*)
    In the past year, judging from the news published in our *Wan Nan Daily*, many news reports are good and valuable. This part of the news reflects the actual lives of the people in the new district, reports on the specific circumstances of implementing policies and mobilizing the masses, and introduces the experiences of the masses in engaging in production and construction, overcoming difficulties, and fighting for their own liberation. This kind of news is of great help and encouragement to the people, so the masses are very concerned and fond of it. This is also one of the reasons why our newspaper is supported and loved by the people.
    However, another part of the news has a common shortcoming, which is the failure to pay attention to specifically reflecting the actual lives of the people. Some news reports, although intended to report on things done by the masses themselves, and issues directly related to the vital interests of the masses, are written in a way that does not focus on the activities of the masses. On the contrary, they are often written as if they were simply things done by the leading organs, or things done only by the cadres. For example, when reporting on the successful completion of dike repairs and polder restoration, we should fully reflect the labor, creation, and achievements of the people, and use concrete facts to illustrate the benefits and joy of the masses. Then, we should briefly introduce the experience of the leadership and the issues that should be paid attention to in the future. However, some news reports are not written from this perspective, but instead use the reports of leading comrades to replace the labor life of the people.
    For example, when reporting on investigating wasteland and replanting, many news reports only say how many *mu* of ripe wasteland the district cadres found after going down to the villages, and how many *mu* of fields were mobilized for replanting. However, the most important aspect, the situation of the masses organizing to replant, is rarely reflected or even not reflected at all. The June 22nd *Wan Nan Daily*, second page, news report on wasteland investigation and replanting in Zhu Village District, Nanling, mentions the district office, district cadres, or village cadres a total of eight times. The only mention of the masses is a vague "village cadres held" "farmers' meetings," and three abstract "wasteland households" "under the mobilization and help of village cadres." There is no reflection of the actual activities of the farmers in replanting.
    Most of the news reports on drought resistance and seedling protection, flood prevention, and many other rural and urban work reports also suffer from the above-mentioned problems. Take the report on the Chizhou Work Team reorganizing basic-level organizations such as Liren Village in Taiping County as an example (Wan Nan Daily, June 23rd, second page, headline). It only contains vague phrases such as "going deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses," "after more than a month of propaganda and deliberation," "raising the awareness of the basic masses," "the work team goes deep into the masses," etc. As for how the broad masses of farmers were "mobilized," how their "awareness" was "raised," and where it was specifically manifested, especially the actual situation of the farmers actively participating as masters of their own affairs, was not mentioned at all. This method of reporting only on the activities of cadres will make readers feel: either the comrades who write and edit the newspaper have neglected the masses; or the work itself is a form of paternalism. We often say that we oppose paternalism, but if many news reports only write about cadres and not about the masses, isn't this intentionally or unintentionally promoting a paternalistic style?
    These articles that have cadre activity but no mass activity, reports that only have tasks but no actual life of the masses, not only make it impossible for the masses to find role models and solutions after reading, but also easily reflect a one-sided view of the facts themselves, and some are even untrue. For example, reports on free lending only say that cadres went to the countryside to mobilize, village cadres led households with surplus grain to voluntarily lend out grain, and the difficulties of the masses with rice seeds and food were resolved, etc. At first glance, this kind of news seems to have no problems because it is written very vaguely. But precisely because it does not reflect any of the real situation of free lending by the masses, does not show the specific activities of the people on both sides of the lending transaction, and does not explain the establishment of contracts and the interest rates of general contracts, some of these submissions are not only one-sided, but also very untrue. It is very likely that it is not the real free lending that we advocate, but paternalistic lending, a disguised form of forced lending.
    Why are there so many news reports that only write about cadres and not about the masses, reports that only have tasks but no actual life of the masses, and why are so many published in the newspaper? One of the main reasons is that our newspaper workers have a relatively weak mass perspective. They always "think that the newspaper is for the cadres to read; and have not clearly realized that the newspaper is primarily for the people to read, to speak to the people." Our newspaper's communications network has always been circling around cadres and leading organs, and has not opened the door to attract activists from the broad masses of people. Our editorial department and offices, and communications stations have long been relaxing, neglecting, or at least placing the task of absorbing and developing worker-peasant correspondents in a very unimportant position. Even a few comrades have ideological problems with the work of developing worker-peasant correspondents, believing that workers and peasants have low cultural levels and do not meet the conditions for being correspondents. They do not know that if the newspaper does not have tens of thousands of worker-peasant correspondents, it will never be able to establish close ties with the broad masses of people.
    Some of our reporters (including offices and communications stations) and some organ correspondents also have a one-sided view in collecting materials and reporting. Some of the facts in the news are not based on their own personal experience and observation, but simply rely on the existing materials from the leading organs and the work reports from below, and even regard them as the only source of news and the only "warehouse" of actual situations. Without analysis, they simply reorganize them, put them into a formula, and publish them as news. This kind of news is generally abstract in content and lacks the concrete and vivid facts of mass life. There is no doubt that the news in the newspaper is different from the work reports and summaries of the organs, but due to the lack of a mass perspective and the laziness in style, some reporters are precisely replacing the news in the newspaper with work reports and summaries.
    The lack of a mass perspective is also reflected in our reporting perspective, which is purely based on "tasks" rather than on the masses. This shows that some comrades do not have a clear understanding of the relationship between tasks and the masses. It should be known that any task put forward by the leading organs comes from the masses. The leading organs concentrate the opinions of the masses, and then put forward tasks, which is to take the opinions of the masses back to the masses, and lead the masses to realize their own demands. Therefore, to put forward tasks, even to put forward tasks that are the overriding central tasks, is because this problem exists among the broad masses of people, and they unanimously and urgently demand to solve this problem that is directly related to the highest interests of the vast majority of people (such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, production and disaster relief, repairing dikes and restoring polders, flood prevention, drought resistance, adjusting industry and commerce, and providing relief to unemployed workers, etc.). We often say that completing tasks should be recognized as solving problems for the broad masses of people. The sign of completing tasks cannot be anything else, but can only be whether it has solved problems for the masses, and whether it is in line with the highest interests of the vast majority of people.
    Because some comrades are not clear about this issue, many news reports and communications, especially reports on central tasks, often start by writing about how cadres go to the countryside, the second step is to say that achievements have been made in the work (some are expressed in numbers, and some are simply vague statements), and the conclusion is that the task has been successfully completed. The newspaper publishes it that way, the correspondents write it that way, and the editors also revise it that way, so that many correspondents who are just starting to write articles and comrades who are just starting to work as editors also imitate it. News written in this formula portrays the cadres as the protagonists of the movement and work, while the protagonist of the movement – the people – is portrayed as "extras." Many news reports do not even have "extras," only cadres singing "solo shows." This will give readers the wrong impression that "tasks" are "completed" by the cadres, and that the "merit" belongs to the cadres.
    From the perspective of general cadre correspondents, some comrades are often in contact with the masses, serving the workers and peasants in the countryside and in factories. However, why do many of their news reports only reflect the activities of cadres and not the lives of the masses? Because: first, some comrades still do not understand the correct relationship between tasks and the masses; second, it also reflects that some comrades do not work in depth. Although they are doing mass work, they have not gone deep into the masses, but are only immersed in the organs, listening to reports, looking at materials, checking statistics, etc., so of course they cannot reflect the lives of the masses; third, some comrades' work "tasks" are even "completed" through paternalism, and some comrades have a "granting" mentality. They see themselves as heroes who can "take care of everything," so the reporting work can only write about how the "heroes" "take care of everything." As for the truth that the people liberate themselves, these comrades do not understand it very well, and they also cannot see the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in production and struggle.
    The lack of a mass perspective has become the most common and main shortcoming in our reporting. We deeply feel that in order to reflect the actual situation of the people's production and struggle, we must go deep into the masses with unlimited enthusiasm, contact the lives and thoughts of the masses, and enthusiastically consult with the masses. We must vigorously develop the worker-peasant correspondent movement, attract a large number of worker-peasant activists to participate in newspaper work, and maintain regular and close contact with them. All of this requires us to work hard to strengthen the mass perspective in news reporting and make a major change in our work style and methods. Only in this way can we truly improve our reporting and make it suitable for the needs of the people.
    Some comrades may say that we are too one-sided in emphasizing reflecting the actual lives of the people, especially the laboring people. There are many other important things to reflect! For example, the leading role of the Party and the People's Government, the important activities of the leading organs, the activities of the work teams, etc. Of course, the leading role of the Party and the government in the lives and struggles of the people should be expressed. The important activities of the leading organs and the activities of cadres and the masses combining are also worth reporting. But to express the leading role of the Party and the government, we should mainly express how the policies of the Party and the government become the actions of the masses. The so-called role can only be expressed from the basic aspect of the actual actions of the masses. Therefore, in the final analysis, we must fully reflect the lives of the people.
    Chairman Mao once instructed us: "'Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang.' This means that the masses have great creativity. Among the Chinese people, there are indeed tens of thousands of Zhuge Liangs. Every village and every town has its own Zhuge Liang. We should go to the masses, learn from the masses, synthesize their experiences, and turn them into better, more organized principles and methods, and then tell the masses (propaganda) and call on the masses to implement them, solve the problems of the masses, and enable the masses to achieve liberation and happiness." This is precisely the basic task of our newspaper. We should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly correct all shortcomings in our work that are divorced from the masses, implement the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," face the masses, and fundamentally improve our work style, thereby greatly improving our newspaper.

    加强新闻报道的群众观点
    （皖南日报钱丹辉）
    近一年来，从我们皖南日报上发表的消息来看，有不少消息是好的，有价值的。这一部分消息，反映了新区人民群众的实际生活，报道了执行政策、发动群众的具体情况，介绍了群众从事生产建设、克服困难以及为解放自己而斗争等方面的经验。这种消息对于人民群众的帮助和鼓励很大，所以群众对它很关心，很喜爱，这也是我们报纸为人民群众所拥护、所热爱的原因之一。
    但是，还有另外一部分消息，存在着一个带普遍性的缺点，就是不注意具体地反映人民群众的实际生活。甚至有一部分消息，虽然要报道的是群众自己动手做的事情，是直接为群众切身利益打算的问题，而我们写起来，不但不以群众活动为主，相反地，往往写成单纯只是领导机关做了的事情，或只是干部动手做了的事情。如报道修堤复圩的胜利完成，本应当充分反映人民群众的劳动创造与成果，用具体事实说明群众的受益和欢喜，然后扼要介绍领导工作的经验以及今后应注意的问题。可是有的消息却不是从这个角度去写的，而以领导同志的报告代替了人民群众的劳动生活。
    又如报道查荒补种，有不少消息便只说区干部下去查出了多少熟荒，发动补种多少亩田，而最重要的群众组织起来补种的情况却很少反映、甚至没有反映。六月二十二日皖南日报二版南陵朱村区查荒补种消息，其中说到区公所、区干部或村干部的地方一共有八处，说到群众的地方，只有一句空洞的“村干部分头召开”的“农民会议”，和三个抽象的“在村干部动员帮助下”的“荒田户”，一点没有反映农民群众补种的实际活动。
    大多数抗旱、保苗的消息，防汛的消息，以及其他好多农村工作以及城市工作的消息，也同样犯了上面的毛病。举池州工作组整理太平县里仁村等基层组织报道为例（皖南日报六月二十三日二版头条），其中只有抽象的“深入农村发动群众”，“经过一个多月的宣传酝酿”，“提高了基本群众的觉悟”，“工作队深入群众”等等几句空话，至于广大农民群众如何“发动”起来，“觉悟”如何“提高”，具体表现在什么地方，特别是农民群众以主人翁姿态积极活动的实际情况，却一点也没有提到。这种只写干部活动的报道方法，会使读者感觉：或者是写稿的和编报的同志把群众忽视了；或者是那个工作本身就是一种包办代替的作法。我们常说反对包办代替，可是，许多消息都只写干部不写群众，岂不是有意无意地在助长包办代替的作风吗！？
    这种有干部活动而没有群众活动的稿子，不但使得群众读后无从找到榜样，找到办法，而且，对于所报道的事实本身来说，也很容易反映片面，甚至有些是不真实的。比如自由借贷的报道，只说干部下乡动员、村干部带动有余粮户自动借出了多少粮食，群众稻种、口粮困难便得以解决等等。初看这种消息因为写的很笼统，似乎看不出有什么问题，但正因为没有反映一点群众自由借贷的真实情况，没有表现借贷双方的具体的人的活动，也没有说明订立契约和一般契约的利息多少，所以这一类的来稿，有一些不但报道片面，而且很不真实。很可能并不是我们所提倡的真正的自由借贷，而是包办借贷，变相的强制借贷。
    只写干部不写群众的消息，只有任务而没有群众实际生活的报道，为什么来的很多，而且报上发表的也很多呢？主要原因之一，就是我们的报纸工作者的群众观点还比较薄弱，总“以为报纸是给干部看的；而没有明确地认识，报纸首先是给人民群众看的，是向人民群众说话的。”我们报纸通讯网的工作，一直是在干部、领导机关中打圈子，而没有把大门开开，吸引广大人民群众中的积极分子进来。我们编辑部和办事处、通讯站，是长期地把吸收与发展工农通讯员的任务放松了，忽视了，至少是把它摆在一个很不重要的位置上。甚至少数同志对发展工农通讯员的工作，在思想上还弄不通，认为工农文化水平低，不合通讯员的条件。而不知道报纸如果没有成千成万的工农通讯员，便永远不能和广大人民群众建立密切的联系。
    我们有的记者（包括办事处、通讯站）和一部分机关通讯员，在搜集材料和报道上也存在着一种片面性。有些消息的事实，并不是经过自己亲身的体验和观察，而只是单纯依靠领导机关的现成材料和下面的工作报告，甚至把它当作消息的唯一来源与实际情况的唯一“仓库”，不加分析，只是稍作整理，套上一种公式，便当作消息发表了。这种消息一般是内容抽象的，缺少群众生活中的具体生动的事实。毫无疑问，报纸上的消息与机关的工作报告、总结，是不一样的，但是由于缺少群众观点，也由于作风上的懒惰，有的记者却正好是把工作报告和总结代替了报纸上的消息。
    群众观点的缺乏也表现我们的报道观点是单纯以“任务”为出发点的，而不是以群众为出发点的。这说明有些同志对于任务和群众的关系认识不清楚。须知领导机关提出的任何一个任务，都是从群众中来的。领导机关集中了群众的意见，然后提出任务，就是把群众中的意见再拿到群众中去，领导群众实现群众自己的要求。所以要提出任务，甚至提出的任务是压倒一切的中心任务，都是因为广大人民群众中存在着这个问题，一致迫切要求解决这个直接关系最大多数人民的最高利益的问题（如剿匪，反霸，减租，生产救灾，修堤复圩，防汛，抗旱，调整工商业，救济失业工人等等）。我们经常说完成任务，就应当认识是为广大人民群众解决问题。完成任务的标帜，不能是别的，而只能看是否为群众解决了问题，是否符合最大多数人民的最高利益。
    因为有些同志对这个问题弄不清楚，所以有不少消息、通讯，尤其是中心任务的报道，往往开头总是写干部如何下乡，第二步是说工作做出了成绩（有的是用数目字表现，有的干脆就是一句空话），结论便是任务圆满完成。报纸是那样发表，通讯员是那么写，编辑也是那么改，以致许多初写稿子的通讯员和初做编辑工作的同志，也都如此模仿起来。用这种公式写出来的消息，便把干部写成运动与工作中的主角，反而把运动的主角——人民群众写成了“跑龙套”的，有不少消息，甚至连“跑龙套”的也没有，只见干部唱“独脚戏”。这会给读者一个错觉，似乎“任务”都是干部去“完成”的，“功劳”都是干部的。
    从一般干部通讯员方面来说，有一些同志虽是和群众经常接触的，虽是在农村、在工厂为工农群众服务的。但是，他们写的消息，为什么很多只有干部的活动而不反映群众的生活呢？因为：第一，是有些同志还不大懂得任务和群众的正确关系；第二，也反映了有些同志工作不深入，虽在作群众工作，却并没有深入到群众中去，只是沉溺在机关里，听汇报，看材料，查统计数字等等，那样当然不能反映出群众的生活；第三，甚至有些同志的工作“任务”就是包办代替“完成”的，有些同志则存在着“恩赐”观点。他们把自己看成“包打天下”的好汉，结果报道工作也便只能写写“好汉”如何“包打天下”。至于人民群众自己解放自己的真理，这些同志是不大懂得的，人民群众在生产与斗争中的积极性、创造力，他们也是看不到的。
    缺乏群众观点已成为我们报道中的最普遍最主要的缺点，我们深感到，要反映人民群众生产与斗争的实际情况，必须以无限的热情深入到群众中去，接触群众的生活与思想，并热心和群众商量。必须大力开展工农通讯员运动，吸引广大的工农积极分子参加报纸工作，与他们保持经常的密切的联系。这一切都需要我们努力加强新闻报道的群众观点，把我们的工作作风和方法来一个大的转变。只有这样，才能使我们的报道真正提高一步，使它适合人民群众的需要。
    我们这样强调反映人民群众特别是劳动人民群众的实际生活，有的同志也许会说：太片面了，还有许多重要事情要反映呢！譬如党和人民政府的领导作用，领导机关的重要活动，工作队的活动等等。当然，党和政府对人民的生活和斗争的领导作用是应当表现的。领导机关的重要活动、干部和群众结合的活动也是可以反映的。但是表现党和政府的领导作用，主要地应当表现党和政府的政策如何变成群众的行动，所谓作用，只有从群众实际行动这个基本方面才能表现出来。因此归根结底，还是必须充分反映人民群众的生活。
    毛主席曾经指示我们：“‘三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮’这就是说，群众有伟大的创造力。中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的诸葛亮，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的诸葛亮。我们应该走到群众中去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理与办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传）并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放与幸福。”这正是我们报纸的基本任务。我们应当按照毛主席的指示，彻底地改正工作中一切脱离群众的缺点，贯彻“从群众中来到群众中去”的群众路线，面向群众，从根本问题上改进我们的工作作风，从而大大改进我们的报纸。
