Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 2nd: Eight thousand students from Yunnan University, Teachers College, Kunming No. 1 Middle School, and other schools held a "December 1st" commemoration meeting here on the 1st. From dawn on the 1st, students carrying flags and anti-American, aid-Korea propaganda posters went in an endless stream to the tombs of the four martyrs, Yu Zai, Pan Yan, Li Lulian, and Zhang Huachang, who were killed by American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits, to present wreaths and silently read the record of the beginning and end of the "December 1st" Movement written by Wen Yiduo and engraved on the stone pillars of the tomb gate. The commemoration meeting was held on the lawn of the Teachers College, where Kunming students gathered five years ago on the eve of the "December 1st" to demand the withdrawal of American troops from China and oppose the civil war. Zheng Boke, Minister of Propaganda of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, elaborated on the occurrence and historical significance of the "December 1st" Movement in his speech, and called on the students to inherit the glorious tradition, learn the heroic, strong, and unyielding spirit of the four martyrs, and fight for resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes and country. After the meeting, a public memorial ceremony was held at the tombs of the four martyrs.

The Student Union of Jiaotong University specially published a special edition commemorating "December 1st", using photos to introduce the beginning and end of the "December 1st" Movement. At the commemoration meeting, Yu Shoumei, the younger sister of Martyr Yu Zai who sacrificed in the "December 1st" Movement, and a political teaching assistant from the school reported on the deeds of Martyr Yu during his lifetime and the circumstances they witnessed of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits committing atrocities at that time.
