The Chinese Christian community, including Wu Yaozong, director of the publishing group of the National Association of Chinese Christian Young Men's Association, Deng Yuzhi, general secretary of the National Association of Chinese Christian Women's Association, Zhao Zichen, professor and dean of the School of Religion at Yenching University in Beijing, and Liu Liangmo, director of the ministry group of the National Association of Chinese Christian Young Men's Association, and 36 others, jointly issued a famous declaration at the end of July this year entitled "The Path for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China," calling on Christians across the country to sever ties between the church and imperialism, eliminate the influence of imperialism in the Chinese Christian Church, and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in order to achieve the goal of reforming Chinese Christianity. This declaration quickly received a response from Christians across the country. As of December 7, 26,727 Christians across the country have signed the above declaration. While Christian people across the country are enthusiastically launching patriotic movements, patriotic elements among Chinese Catholics are also initially launching a self-reliant and innovative patriotic movement from the bottom up. More than 500 Catholics in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan Administrative Region, jointly issued a "Self-Reliance and Innovation Movement Declaration" at the end of November. Like patriotic Christians, they proposed to resolutely sever ties with imperialism in all aspects and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. The declaration also called on Catholics across the country to support this movement. The initiative of Catholics in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan, has attracted the attention of Catholic masses across the country. While reforming internally, the vast numbers of Christian and Catholic believers in various regions are uniting with the people of the whole country to fight for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending our country.

Catholicism and Christianity were introduced into China very early, and developed more widely after the Opium War in 1840-1842, when Britain invaded China. It is estimated that Catholicism has about 3 million believers in China, including about 12,000 missionaries (priests, monks, etc.) who are engaged in religion as a profession; Christianity has about 700,000 believers and 10,000 missionaries (pastors, etc.). The activities of these two religions have been closely related to imperialist aggression against China from the very beginning. As the first American Christian missionary to come to China in 1830, Bridgman, said, the reason why foreign missionaries came to China from thousands of miles away was "less for religious reasons than for political reasons." Some of them were sent to China by foreign governments along with opium dealers and gunboats to serve as intelligence agents and vanguards of aggression. They relied on successive imperialist wars of aggression and unequal treaties to continuously expand their power. Many foreign missionaries colluded with Chinese feudal landlords, bureaucrats, and compradores, using trickery and force to oppress the good, causing many serious rebellions among the Chinese people, leaving behind bloody and tearful events in our history. They ran many churches, schools, hospitals, and other cultural and relief institutions in China. Most of these institutions were subsidized by foreign countries and were effectively led by foreign missionaries. Foreigners accounted for nearly half of the Catholic missionaries (i.e., 5,500 people); foreigners also accounted for 17 percent of the Christian missionaries (1,700 people). Therefore, it was easy for imperialism to influence and control the activities of the church. Some church organizations became institutions for imperialism to cover up espionage activities. British and American churches were the main forces in both religions, and in recent years the power of the American church has surpassed that of the British. After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, although the imperialist influence in these two religions was severely hit, the imperialists still left many foreign missionaries in the churches of these two religions and controlled economic power and property rights. The imperialists continued to sow discord among believers and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda and espionage sabotage activities under the guise of the church. It is precisely because of this that patriotic people within the two religions have put forward the slogans of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in order to thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialist forces in the Chinese church and turn Catholicism and Christianity into religious undertakings run by the Chinese themselves.

The declaration issued by Chinese Christians at the end of July this year, entitled "The Path for Chinese Christians to Strive in the Construction of New China," pointed out: The general task of Christian reform is: "Chinese Christian churches and organizations thoroughly support The Common Program, and under the leadership of the government, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China." Its basic principles are: "(1) Chinese Christian churches and organizations should make the greatest efforts and effective methods to make church members clearly understand the crimes committed by imperialism in China, recognize the facts that imperialism has used Christianity in the past, eliminate imperialist influences within Christianity, be vigilant against the conspiracy of imperialism, especially American imperialism, to use religion to cultivate reactionary forces, and at the same time, call on them to participate in the movement to oppose war and defend peace, and educate them to thoroughly understand and support the government's land reform policy. (2) Chinese Christian churches and organizations should use effective methods to cultivate the patriotic and democratic spirit and the psychology of self-respect and self-confidence of the general believers. The movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation advocated by Chinese Christianity in the past has achieved considerable success, and this task should be completed in the shortest possible time in the future; at the same time, self-criticism should be promoted, and reviews and adjustments should be implemented in various tasks, streamlining and frugality should be practiced to achieve the goal of Christian reform." The above-mentioned declaration also stipulates the specific methods of Christian reform as: "(1) Chinese Christian churches and organizations that still rely on foreign talent and economic assistance should formulate specific plans to achieve the goal of self-reliance in the shortest possible time. (2) In the future, Christian churches and organizations should focus on the profound understanding of the essence of Christ in religious work, the unity between denominations, the cultivation of leading talents, and the improvement of church systems; in general work, they should focus on anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist education and labor production, understanding the times, recreational activities, literacy education, medical and health care, child care, and other work to serve the people."

The Chinese Christian patriotic reform movement has made rapid progress since the above declaration was issued. As of December 7, 26,727 Christians across the country have signed the Declaration of Chinese Christian Renewal. This includes the majority of leaders and the broad masses of believers in local church organizations.

The 14th annual meeting of the National Christian Council of China, held in Shanghai from October 18 to 25, unanimously adopted the above-mentioned reform declaration. This meeting was a major sign of the overall development of the Chinese Christian reform movement. This meeting was the first large gathering of Christian church leaders and representative figures from all over the country after liberation. The meeting mainly discussed the issue of church reform. The meeting called on Christians across the country to actively sign the declaration, and all church institutions and organizations should complete the goals of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation with the greatest determination within five years. The meeting elected a new executive committee of the National Christian Council of China. Wu Gaozi was elected as the new president, Wu Yifang, Cui Xianxiang, and Wu Yaozong as vice presidents, and Bao Zeqing, Jiang Changchuan, Chen Jianzhen, Deng Yuzhi and others as 30 executive members. The new executive committee has decided to invite national Christian organizations to establish a committee to promote the Three-Self Patriotic Movement to be completed in five years, and local Christian united organizations will also establish similar institutions. The meeting also called on Christians across the country to support the people's government's implementation of land reform with practical actions, to strive to learn new era knowledge, and to respond to the movement to solicit cold clothes to relieve disaster victims.

Since the launch of the nationwide movement of the people to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes, and defend our country, Christian churches in many regions have combined the signature campaign with various patriotic activities. The National Association of Christian Endeavor Societies of China in Shanghai wrote a letter to the Christian community of Korea, expressing support for the just struggle of the Korean people against American aggression. Christian churches in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Haikou, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Wuhu, Suiyuan and other places have successively issued patriotic declarations and organized current affairs studies. The declarations in various places unanimously emphasized supporting the just action of the people of the whole country to resist America and aid Korea, and called on believers to be doubly vigilant against the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggression. The Trade Union and Cultural and Educational Department of Christian institutions in Shanghai organized the study of the nature of American imperialism and its history of aggression against China, and also published pamphlets such as "Christian Understanding of America."

Christian representatives in many places held meetings to enthusiastically discuss the significance of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the methods for launching this sacred movement in Christian churches and organizations. Christian figures in Beijing held a forum on resisting America and aiding Korea on November 15 at the invitation of the Beijing Office of the Tianjin Progressive Daily. At this forum, Zhao Zichen, Dean of the School of Religion at Yenching University, said: We Christians are Christians on the one hand, and patriotic Chinese people on the other hand, and we must stand on the side of the oppressed people in the world. Our resistance to America and aid to Korea today is to help the Korean people liberate themselves from suffering. From a Christian point of view, this is moral and just behavior. He said: Our contempt for America, hatred for America, and resistance to America does not conflict with our religious beliefs, because resisting America is what Christ Jesus called "opposing evil." We Christians must resist evil forces. We must resolutely resist the evil forces that oppress people, exploit people, prevent people from being liberated, and prevent people from turning over. Regarding how Christians can support the movement to resist America and aid Korea, safeguard our homes, and defend our country with practical actions, Pastor Pang Zhikun, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Beijing Christian Federation, and Pastor Wei Wenju, General Secretary of the Congregational Church, unanimously proposed at the meeting that Christians should strive to collect clothing and food and participate in relief organizations to support the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist America and aid Korea. Chen Wenrun, General Secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, also said: We should strive to complete the Three-Self Patriotic Movement earlier to support the movement to resist America and aid Korea, safeguard our homes, and defend our country.

Christians in Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Nanping and other places in Fujian Province also held forums and lectures on resisting America and aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending our country. Church organizations and church schools in Fuzhou City have generally launched current affairs studies, and Tan Renmei, Dean of Academic Affairs of Fujian Union University, also wrote an article in Fujian Daily, calling on believers to recognize the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggression in their studies.

Forty-one representatives from 26 Christian organizations in Hangzhou City have held a meeting and unanimously passed the "Patriotic Covenant of Christian People" and called on believers in the city to abide by this covenant.

The Guangdong Christian Association and the Guangzhou Christian Organizations United Association convened a joint meeting and adopted the "Guangzhou Christians' Covenant to Support World Peace and Oppose American Aggression," which includes: (1) Resolutely promote the "Resolution on Church Reform Movement" of the National Christian Council of China, actively solve the problems of church self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, and sever ties with American imperialism. (2) Be vigilant against sabotage activities by American-Chiang bandits and special agents, and report them at any time and place. (3) Strengthen the study of New Democracy and current affairs, expose the rumors created by American imperialism and special agents, and eliminate pro-American, fear-American, and flattering-American reactionary and erroneous ideas. (4) Take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and support the army, support the government, and support land reform. This covenant has been warmly supported by Christians in Guangzhou. More than 600 people, including principals of church schools, presidents of theological seminaries, directors of church hospitals, pastors, and heads of Christian organizations, representing nearly 20,000 Christians in Guangzhou, held a conference on December 3. At the conference, they unanimously responded to the church reform movement and the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes, and defend our country, and called on Christians in the city to sign the "Covenant to Support World Peace and Oppose American Imperialist Aggression." In order to strengthen learning, Christian organizations in the city have formed the "Guangzhou Christian Workers' New Knowledge Learning Association," and many missionaries and pastors have actively participated. Hu Yiyun, General Secretary of the Guangdong Christian Association, Zhao Guanhai, Vice President of the Guangzhou Christian Organizations United Association, and 25 other Christian representatives jointly issued a statement exposing the activities of imperialism using religion for aggression in history; and called on Christians throughout the province to unite closely, be doubly vigilant, and prevent American-Chiang bandits and special agents from infiltrating church activities.

On the Catholic side, more than 500 Catholics in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan Administrative Region, jointly issued the "Self-Reliance and Innovation Movement Declaration" for the first time on November 30. The declaration stated: "Based on the standpoint of loving the motherland and loving the people, we resolutely sever ties with imperialists in all aspects, eliminate pro-American, fear-American, and flattering-American ideas, rely on our own efforts to build a new church of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, and prevent the sanctity of the church from being tarnished by imperialism again. … In order to get rid of the conspiracy of imperialist aggression, we should actively support the movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes, and defend our country with practical actions, consolidate the world peace and democracy camp, and strive together to build a new China." Prior to the issuance of the above declaration, all teachers and students of Fu Jen Catholic University, which is run by the Catholic Church, launched a struggle in October this year to oppose imperialism's use of the church to interfere in China's educational sovereignty and expelled imperialist forces. The school was then taken over by our Central People's Government to be run independently.

Recently, Christians and Catholics have united more closely to launch a struggle against insult and slander. Austin, the representative of the US imperialist government to the United Nations Security Council, shamelessly called the US's cultural aggression against China "friendship to the Chinese people" in his speech to the Security Council on November 28. Austin listed the fact that the United States had run many hospitals and schools in China through the church, attempting to prove that the United States "is not a bloody aggressor." Members of schools, hospitals and organizations supported by churches (including Christians and Catholics) across the country expressed great anger at Austin's slander and launched a patriotic movement to counter Austin's slander and liquidate American imperialism's cultural aggression against China. On December 13, more than 19,000 people from more than 50 Christian and Catholic church organizations, including the North China Christian Federation, Methodist Church, Congregational Church, Chinese Christian Church, Anglican Church, Young Men's Christian Association, Young Women's Christian Association, Far East Mission Society, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Assemblies of God, Saint Mary's Literary Association, and church schools, hospitals, and students studying in the United States in Beijing, held a demonstration parade against Austin's slander. Religious figures in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Shenyang and other places immediately responded enthusiastically to this patriotic and anti-imperialist demonstration. The Christian community in Shanghai is now preparing to hold a mass rally, and all units have decided to strengthen the study and propaganda of current affairs and the declaration of religious reform. This movement is still developing vigorously.

The patriotic and anti-imperialist movement of Chinese religious figures shows the breadth and strength of the united front of the Chinese people in loving the country and opposing imperialism. This situation is unprecedented in Chinese history. The increasing development of this movement foreshadows that the Chinese people will surely win the final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression.

    中国基督教、天主教人士的爱国运动
    盖之
    中国基督教人士，中国基督教青年会全国协会出版组主任吴耀宗、中华基督教女青年会总干事邓裕志、北京燕京大学教授兼宗教学院院长赵紫宸，中华基督教青年会全国协会事工组主任刘良模等四十人，于本年七月底联名向全国基督教徒发出了题为“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”的著名宣言，号召全国基督教徒割断教会与帝国主义的联系，肃清帝国主义在中国基督教会的影响，实行自治、自养、自传，以达到革新中国基督教的目标。这一宣言迅速地获得了全国各地基督教徒的响应。截至十二月七日为止，全国各地基督教徒在上述宣言签名者，已达两万六千七百二十七人。在全国各地基督教人士热烈地展开爱国运动同时，中国天主教人士中的爱国分子，亦自下而上初步地展开了自立革新的爱国运动。川北行政区广元县天主教徒五百余人已于十一月底联名发表“自立革新运动宣言”，他们和基督教爱国人士同样地提出要坚决地在各方面与帝国主义割断关系，实行自治、自养、自传；宣言并号召全国天主教教友们支持这个运动。川北广元县天主教徒的这个首倡举动，已引起全国各地天主教徒群众的重视。与革新内部同时，各地基督教和天主教的广大教徒，都正在与全国人民团结一致地为抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。
    天主教和基督教传入中国很早，自一八四○至一八四二年英国侵略中国的鸦片战争发生之后更加普遍发展。据估计，天主教在中国拥有教徒约三百万人，其中以宗教为职业的传教士（神父、修士等）约一万二千人；基督教教徒约有七十万人，传教士（牧师等）约一万人。这两个宗教的活动一开始就与帝国主义的对华侵略有密切的关系。外国教士所以不远万里而来中国，用一八三○年美国第一个来到中国的基督教教士裨治文牧师的话来说，“与其说是由于宗教的原因，毋宁说是由于政治的原因”。他们中间有一批人是由外国政府跟鸦片贩子和炮舰一起派到中国来作情报人员和侵略先锋的。他们依靠一次接连一次的帝国主义侵略战争和不平等条约不断地扩大其势力。有许多外国传教士与中国的封建地主、官僚、买办相结托，巧取豪夺，欺压善良，以至在中国人民中引起了许多次严重的反抗，在我们的历史上留下了血泪斑斑的事迹。他们在中国办有许多教堂、学校、医院及其他文化、救济机关。这些机关绝大部分都受外国津贴，并由外国教士占据实际领导地位。天主教的传教士中，外国人几占一半（即五千五百人）；基督教的传教士中，外国人亦占百分之十七（一千七百人）。因此，帝国主义就很容易影响和控制教会的活动。有些教会组织则成为帝国主义掩护进行间谍活动的机关。两个宗教中都以英美教会占主要势力，近年来美国教会的势力又超过了英国。中国人民革命胜利以后，这两个宗教中的帝国主义影响虽然受到了重大的打击，但是帝国主义者却仍在这两个宗教的教会中留有许多外国教士，并掌握经济权和财产权。帝国主义者在教徒中继续进行挑拨离间，并利用教会的掩护继续进行反革命的宣传和间谍破坏活动。正因为如此，两个宗教内部的爱国人士才提出了自治、自养、自传的口号，以求彻底肃清帝国主义势力在中国教会的影响，把天主教和基督教变为中国人自办的宗教事业。
    中国基督教人士在今年七月底发表的题为“中国基督教徒在新中国建设中努力的途径”的宣言指出：基督教改革总的任务为：“中国基督教教会及团体彻底拥护共同纲领，在政府的领导下，反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义，为建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。”其基本方针是：“（一）中国基督教会及团体应以最大的努力，及有效的方法，使教会群众清楚地认识帝国主义在中国所造成的罪恶，认识帝国主义过去利用基督教的事实，肃清基督教内部的帝国主义影响，警惕帝国主义、尤其是美帝国主义利用宗教以培养反动力量的阴谋，同时号召他们参加反对战争、拥护和平的运动，并教育他们彻底了解及拥护政府的土地改革政策。（二）中国基督教教会及团体，应用有效的办法，培养一般信徒爱国民主的精神，和自尊自信的心理。中国基督教过去所倡导的自治、自养、自传的运动，已有相当成就，今后应在最短期内，完成此项任务；同时提倡自我批评，在各种工作上，实行检讨整理，精简节约，以达到基督教革新的目标。”上述宣言并规定基督教革新的具体办法为：“（一）中国基督教教会及团体，凡仍仰赖外国人才与经济之协助者，应拟定具体计划，在最短期内，实现自力更生的目标。（二）今后基督教教会及团体，在宗教工作方面，应注重基督本质的深刻认识，宗派间的团结、领导人才的培养和教会制度的改进；在一般工作方面，应注重反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的教育及劳动生产、认识时代、文娱活动、识字教育、医药卫生、儿童保育等为人民服务的工作。”
    中国基督教的爱国革新运动，在上述宣言发出之后，已获得迅速的进展。截至十二月七日为止，全国各地基督教徒在中国基督教革新宣言上签名的已达两万六千七百二十七人。其中包括了各地教会团体的多数负责人和广大的教徒。
    十月十八日至二十五日在上海举行的中华全国基督教协进会第十四届年会，全体代表一致地通过拥护上述革新宣言。这个会议，乃是中国基督教革新运动全面发展的重大标志。这个会议是全国各地解放后基督教教会领袖和代表性人物的首次大集会。会议主要地是讨论了教会革新问题。会议号召全国基督徒踊跃地在宣言上签名，各教会机关、团体要以最大决心在五年内完成自治、自养、自传的目标。会议选举了中华基督教协进会的新的执行委员会。选出吴高梓为新会长，吴贻芳、崔宪详、吴耀宗为副会长，鲍哲庆、江长川、陈见真、邓裕志等三十人为执行委员。新执行委员会已决定邀请全国性的基督教团体，成立五年完成三自运动促进委员会，各地基督教联合组织也将成立同样机构。会议并号召全国基督教徒，以实际行动拥护人民政府实施土地改革，努力学习新时代知识和响应劝募寒衣救济灾民运动。
    自全国各地人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动展开后，许多地区的基督教会即与签名运动相结合，进行各种爱国活动。上海中华基督教勉励会全国协会曾写信慰问朝鲜基督教徒，声援朝鲜人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争。上海、北京、南京、九江、广州、海口、太原、兰州、杭州、长沙、芜湖、绥远等地的基督教会，相继发表了爱国宣言，并组织时事学习。各地宣言中一致强调拥护全国人民抗美援朝的正义行动，号召教徒加倍警惕帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋。上海各基督教机关工会文教部主办了认识美帝国主义本质及其侵华史的学习，此外还出版了“基督教对美国应有的认识”等小册子。
    许多地方的基督教代表人物举行集会，热烈地讨论了抗美援朝运动的意义，以及在基督教教会及团体中展开这一神圣运动的办法。在北京的基督教人士于十一月十五日应天津进步日报北京办事处的邀请，举行了抗美援朝座谈会。在这次座谈会中，燕京大学宗教学院院长赵紫宸说：我们基督教徒，一方面是基督徒，一方面是爱国的中国人民，而且要站在世界上被压迫人民的一边。我们今天的抗美援朝是援助朝鲜人民从痛苦中解放出来，从基督教义上看，这是道义的，正义的行为。他说：我们鄙视美国、仇视美国、反抗美国，并不与我们的宗教信仰冲突，因为抗美就是基督耶稣所说的“反对罪恶”。我们基督教徒是要反抗恶势力的，我们要坚决反抗压迫人、剥削人、不让人民解放，不让人民翻身的那种恶势力。关于基督教徒如何以实际行动支援抗美援朝保家卫国运动，北京基督教联合会执委会主席庞之焜牧师和公理会总干事魏文举牧师在会上一致提出：基督教徒应努力募集衣物、粮食和参加救护组织，支援中国人民抗美援朝志愿军。女青年会总干事陈文润也说：我们应努力提早完成自治、自养、自传运动，来支援抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    福建省福州、漳州、南平等地的基督教徒也纷纷举行抗美援朝保家卫国座谈会和讲演会。福州市的教会团体和教会学校已普遍展开时事学习，福建协和大学教务长檀仁梅并在福建日报著文，号召教徒在学习中要认清帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋。
    杭州市二十六个基督教团体的四十一名代表，已举行集会，一致通过了“基督教人士爱国公约”，并号召该市教徒遵守此项公约。
    广东基督教协进会和广州市基督教团体联合会曾召开联席会议，通过了“广州市基督徒拥护保卫世界和平反对美国侵略公约”，内容为：（一）坚决推行全国基督教协进会关于“教会革新运动的决议”，积极解决教会的自治、自养、自传问题，割断与美帝国主义的关系。（二）警惕美蒋土匪特务破坏活动，并随时随地予以检举。（三）加强新民主主义及时事学习，揭发美帝国主义及特务所造谣言，肃清亲美、恐美的反动错误思想。（四）以实际行动抗美援朝，并拥军、拥政、拥护土地改革。这个公约获得广州市教徒的热烈拥护。代表着广州市近两万基督教徒的教会学校校长、神学院院长、教会医院院长、牧师、和基督教团体负责人六百多人于十二月三日举行了大会，会上一致响应教会革新运动及抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并号召全市基督教徒都在“拥护保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略公约”上签名。为了加强学习，全市基督教团体已组成“广州市基督教工作人员新知学习会”，许多传教士、牧师都踊跃参加。广东基督教协进会总干事胡翼云、广州市基督教团体联合会副会长招观海等二十七位基督教代表人物曾联名发表谈话，揭露帝国主义在历史上利用宗教进行侵略的活动；并号召全省基督教徒紧密团结起来，加倍警惕，防止美蒋匪特混入教会活动。
    在天主教方面，川北行政区广元县天主教徒五百余人已于十一月三十日首次联名发表“自立革新运动宣言”。宣言中说：“我们基于爱祖国、爱人民的立场，坚决与帝国主义者割断各方面的关系，并肃清亲美、恐美、媚美的思想，自力更生，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会，不让教会的圣洁，再受帝国主义的玷污。……我们为要摆脱帝国主义者的阴谋侵略，更应当积极地以实际行动支持抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，巩固世界和平民主阵营，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。”在上述宣言发表之前，天主教教会所办的辅仁大学的全体师生，在本年十月间曾展开了反对帝国主义利用教会干涉中国教育主权的斗争，驱逐了帝国主义势力。该校随即由我中央人民政府收回自办。
    最近以来，基督教和天主教的教徒们更联合一致地展开了反污辱、反诽谤的斗争。美国帝国主义政府驻联合国安全理事会代表奥斯汀，在十一月二十八日在安理会的演说中，曾无耻地把美国对中国的文化侵略称为“对中国人民的友谊”。奥斯汀列举了美国经过教会在中国办了许多医院、学校等，企图以此证明美国“并不是血腥侵略者”。全国各地教会（包括基督教和天主教）所支持的学校、医院和团体的成员们，对于奥斯汀的诬蔑，表示极大愤怒，并展开了反奥斯汀诽谤、清算美帝国主义对华文化侵略的爱国运动。十二月十三日，北京基督教和天主教的各教会团体华北基督教联合会、卫理公会、公理会、中华基督教会、圣公会、男青年会、女青年会、远东宣教会、安息日会、神召会、圣母文学会和各教会学校、医院及留美学生共五十余单位一万九千余人举行了反奥斯汀诬蔑示威游行大会。上海、南京、武汉、沈阳等地宗教界人士也立即热烈地响应了这个爱国反帝示威行动。上海基督教界现已正在筹备召开一次群众性的大会，各单位并决定加强时事和宗教革新宣言的学习和宣传。这个运动还正在汹涌澎湃地发展之中。
    中国宗教界人士的爱国反帝运动，表示着中国人民爱国的反帝国主义的统一战线的广泛和强大。这种情况是中国历史上空前未有的。这个运动的日益发展，预示着中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。
