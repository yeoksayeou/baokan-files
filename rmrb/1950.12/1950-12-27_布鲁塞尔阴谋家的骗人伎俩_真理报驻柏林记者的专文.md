Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th (TASS): Pravda's Berlin correspondent Naumov wrote in an article entitled "The Deceptive Tricks of the Brussels Conspirators": When the communique of the Brussels meeting of the North Atlantic Group countries appeared, it caused the same surprise in Western European political circles. Before the meeting, no one doubted that Acheson, spurred on by his President's war-mongering speech, would this time unceremoniously sweep aside the weak opposition of his European colleagues and force them to unconditionally agree to the American plan to restore the West German army.

The newspapers have already reported that Acheson did not listen to anyone in Brussels, but only issued orders himself. On the first day, he burst into angry accusations against his partners, condemning their slow action. Acheson threatened that if they did not implement his demands, the United States would revoke its financial and military "aid" to European countries and insisted that Western European countries immediately declare a state of emergency.

When General Eisenhower was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the European forces of the Atlantic Group, the dictatorial role of the United States was particularly vivid. At this time, even a little basic tact was no longer used towards European partners. Eisenhower was not appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Atlantic Army by the North Atlantic Treaty Council, but by Truman. And the American President, in doing so, shamelessly declared that Eisenhower would carry out "exactly the same mission" in Europe as MacArthur was carrying out in Asia.

Naumov continued: Judging from the situation in Brussels at the time, it was expected that an unambiguous statement on the remilitarization of West Germany might be issued. However, the published communique contained only a few vague lines on the German question, saying that "complete agreement" had been reached "on the role that Germany could play in the general defense."

The very next day, Adenauer and his followers realized that it was just a set of deceptive tricks at the Brussels meeting. The North Atlantic Treaty Council suggested to the governments of the United States, Britain and France that the issue of West German remilitarization should be "discussed" with the Bonn government. In other words, all issues concerning the establishment of the West German army - the size of the army, the number of formations, and the method of merging them into the Atlantic army - are being handed over to Adenauer and his friends in Petersberg for decision.

The reporter also said: Under pressure from the United States, Western countries decided to agree to Adenauer's demand to replace the occupation statute with a so-called "security agreement," and openly concluded an aggressive military alliance with revived German militarism, in violation of international agreements. The West German army is being built according to the original American plan, which stipulates the establishment of many fully staffed German divisions. Everyone knows that the "American plan" was drafted by a group of Hitler's generals led by Guderian.

The West German industrialists and businessmen have not been forgotten either. According to newspaper reports, the Brussels meeting decided to greatly increase the German merchant fleet. Arms production is now permitted in West Germany, and from now on, no sector of industry will be prohibited in West Germany. It seems that the vague wording in the Brussels communique regarding the remilitarization of West Germany is merely a means of concealing the various practical decisions of the Brussels meeting. But why did Acheson and his partners adopt such a cheap trick? Military men know that rebuilding Hitler's army is like playing with fire.

The warmongers are afraid of the people, so they would rather not announce the resolutions they have adopted, but secretly deal behind the scenes to carry out the remilitarization of West Germany.

The reporter wrote: However, the situation of the Brussels conspirators is also not going smoothly, because the Soviet government's proposal on November 3rd to convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Great Powers to consider the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism has won the enthusiastic support of the people of Western Europe, including the German people. The governments of the United States, Britain and France have spent six weeks considering how to avoid this proposal, which overturns all their plans. The Brussels conspirators want to hide their resolution to immediately remilitarize West Germany from public opinion, while pretending that they are not refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

Various conspiracies regarding dealing with the Soviet proposal have been exposed by the bourgeois newspapers themselves. Many Western newspapers have admitted that after the Brussels meeting has made its resolutions, it will not return to the policy of the Potsdam Agreement.

The article stated: The reason why the instigators of war are adopting such cheap tricks suitable for petty swindlers is that they hope to use deception to push the people of all countries into bloody slaughter. But illegitimate methods will not help them. Peace-loving mankind is vigilantly guarding peace.

### 布鲁塞尔阴谋家的骗人伎俩  真理报驻柏林记者的专文

    布鲁塞尔阴谋家的骗人伎俩
    真理报驻柏林记者的专文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：真理报驻柏林记者瑙莫夫在题为“布鲁塞尔阴谋家的骗人伎俩”一文中写道：当北大西洋集团国家的布鲁塞尔会议公报出现的时候，它使西欧政界感到同样的惊讶。在会前，没有一个人怀疑，艾奇逊受了他的总统贩卖战争的演说的鼓动，这一次要不客气地扫除他的欧洲同僚们的微弱的反对，而使他们无条件地同意美国恢复西德军队的计划。
    报纸已经报道过：艾奇逊在布鲁塞尔并不听别人的话，只是自己发号施令。第一天，他就破口大骂他的伙伴们，并谴责他们行动迟缓。艾奇逊威吓说，如果它们不实行他的要求的话，美国要撤销对欧洲国家的财政与军事“援助”，并且坚持西欧国家立即宣布紧急状态。
    在艾森豪威尔将军被任命为大西洋集团欧洲军队的最高统帅时，美国独裁的角色就表现得特别生动。这个时候，对欧洲伙伴们甚至连一点点基本的圆滑手段都不用了。艾森豪威尔不是被北大西洋公约理事会，而是被杜鲁门任命为大西洋军队的最高统帅的。而美国总统在这样做时，毫不难为情地宣称：艾森豪威尔将在欧洲执行与麦克阿瑟在亚洲执行的“完全一样的任务”。
    瑙莫夫继称：当时从布鲁塞尔的情形来判断，预料可能发表一个关于西德重行军事化的不含糊的声明。可是所发表的公报内，对于德国问题只有含糊的几行，说什么“对德国在一般防御中所能担当的任务”，已获得“完全一致的意见”。
    就在第二天，阿登纳和他的党徒们便认识到那不过是布鲁塞尔会议上所要的一套欺骗手法而已。大西洋公约理事会向美英法三国政府建议：西德重行军事化的问题应与波恩政府“讨论”。换言之，关于成立西德军的一切问题——军队的大小，编队的数目和把它们合并到大西洋军队里面去的方法——的决定正在交与阿登纳和他的彼得斯堡的朋友们。
    该记者又说：西方国家在美国压力之下决定答应阿登纳以所谓“安全协定”代替占领法规的要求，并违反了国际协定公开地与复活的德国军国主义缔结侵略的军事同盟。西德军正是按照美国的原定计划来建立，该计划规定成立许多足额人数的德国师。大家都知道：“美国计划”是由以古德林为首的希特勒的一群将军们所拟定的。
    西德的工业家和商人也未被遗忘。据报纸报道，布鲁塞尔会议决定大大增加德国的商船。军火生产现在西德已经被许可了，从此以后，在西德就不再有任何一部门的工业被禁止了。由此看来，布鲁塞尔会议公报关于西德重行军事化的含糊其词，只不过是掩盖布鲁塞尔会议的种种实际决定的一种手段罢了。但是艾奇逊和他的伙伴们为什么采用这种廉价的伎俩呢？军事家们都知道他们重新建立希特勒军队，就等于在玩火。
    战争贩子们害怕人民，因此，他们宁可不宣布他们所采取的决议，而偷偷摸摸地在幕后打交道，以进行西德的重行军事化。
    该记者写道：可是，布鲁塞尔的阴谋家们的情况也并不顺利，因为苏联政府在十一月三日所提出的召开大国外长会议以便考虑实行有关肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定的建议，获得了包括德国人民在内的西欧人民的热诚的拥护。美、英、法三国政府已化了六个星期的时间考虑怎样避免这个推翻了它们的一切计划的建议。布鲁塞尔的阴谋家们想把他们立刻使西德重行军事化的决议隐瞒过公众舆论，同时又要假装出他们并不拒绝与苏联谈判。
    关于对付苏联的建议所进行的种种阴谋，已经被资产阶级的报纸自己揭露出来了。许多西方报纸已承认，布鲁塞尔会议既决定了决议以后，就不会回复到波茨坦协定的政策去了。
    该文称：战争鼓动者之所以采取这种适用于小骗子的廉价伎俩，是希望用骗局把各国人民推进血腥的屠杀里去。但是不正当的方法对他们不会有帮助的。爱好和平的人类在警惕地守卫着和平。
