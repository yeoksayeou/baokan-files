    For the Motherland!
    —A Record of the Youthful Students' Enthusiasm for Participating in Military Cadre Schools
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    Under the threat of the flames of aggression of American imperialism, our motherland issued a call to its children—young students and young workers: consolidate national defense and participate in national defense construction!
    In the capital, 40,000 university and middle school students had just returned from factories and rural areas where they conducted propaganda work against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The moment they saw the newspaper and the call, they jumped and shouted everywhere, "The call from the motherland that we have been waiting for every day has finally arrived!" At the New China's first new-type university—Renmin University of China—more than 2,000 young students signed up to participate in national defense construction. Many students at Tsinghua University, fearing that their physical condition would not meet the requirements, immediately rushed to the city to have their bodies examined. Chen Shousong, a student at the Engineering College of Peking University, had a slight problem with his leg, but he resolutely signed up to join the Air Force, determined to learn the spirit of the Soviet legless pilot in "The Story of a Real Man." Students at Yiwenzhong School were even more actively doing morning exercises and playing on parallel bars to strengthen their bodies. Students at Municipal No. 8 Middle School, when playing games, did not forget to imitate tank models. The students of Beijing, with the tradition of the "December 9th" Movement, felt their blood boiling upon hearing the call of the motherland! In the short span of a few days of formal registration, 7,000 students enthusiastically wrote down their names.
    In the Northeast—the base of New China's industrial construction and the outpost of national defense—the call of December 1st particularly stirred the young students' determination to rise up and defend the motherland. They cannot forget the 14 years of humiliation under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism. After liberation, the Northeast produced banners of New China's youth such as Zhao Guoyou, Zhao Guilan, Liang Jun, and Tian Guiying! Northeast students knew very well that as long as they worked hard, they could have the same brilliant future. But now, the sound of cannons by the Yalu River threatened their future hopes. They must rise up to defend it. According to incomplete statistics from November, more than 20,000 university and middle school students in the Northeast participated in military schools and revolutionary work.
    In Shanghai, students still have the deep imprint of the American imperialists' indiscriminate bombing and blockade of Shanghai in their hearts. Cheng Yannian, a student at Yucai Middle School, was still wearing mourning clothes for his parents who were killed by American planes. Dong Yangkai, a student at Guanghua University, had his mother, crippled by American planes, still lying in bed. The wreckage of the shipyard was still vivid in the minds of Shanghai students; the cries of the families of the power company workers who were killed in the bombing still resonated in the ears of Shanghai students. Blood debts must be paid, and robbers must be driven out! More than 10,000 students in Shanghai signed up to join military schools, which was their powerful answer to the atrocities of the American imperialists.
    In Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, Baoding, Jinan, and Zhangjiakou, every day, dozens, hundreds, and thousands of students and Youth League members were writing letters to their parents, teachers, and League organizations, requesting permission to participate in national defense construction, to become people's airmen, sailors, and tankers, to defend their beloved motherland like the Soviet Matrosov and Kozhedub!
    The motherland, Chinese students know how to love and how to protect her! "Without the motherland, there is nothing," students at Shandong University shouted the call from the bottom of the hearts of millions of students across the country! They had watched helplessly as their school was used as a barracks by the American army. The mother and sister-in-law of overseas Chinese student Liu Mingfang were both shot and burned to death alive by the imperialists. And the students in the Northeast only studied for seven months a year and had to do five months of hard labor—this was life under the bayonets of Japanese imperialism! A graduate of the Engineering College of Zhejiang University hanged himself in the toilet of Jiaotong University because Chinese factories were in the hands of imperialists, and there was no room for an engineer who sincerely wanted to serve the motherland! Shen Chong, a female student at Peking University, was raped by American soldiers on Chinese soil, but the criminal American soldier Pi Pearson was declared not guilty.
    For the independence and liberation of their beloved motherland, Chinese students have been fighting for 30 years. Many schools can tell the blood debts of the reactionary派屠殺killing their students and the names of many sacrificed heroes. Buried on the campus of Tsinghua University are the bodies of students who were shot by the Duan Qirui warlord government in the "March 18th" Massacre; Zhejiang University students cannot forget Yu Zisan, the chairman of the student union who was killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang before liberation; Jiaotong University students are advancing on the bloodstains of Mu Hanxiang and Shi Xiaoyun; Kunming students just commemorated the four martyrs who died five years ago on December 1st; Chongqing students excavated the bodies of many of their beloved comrades from the Zhazidong and Bai Gongguan American Special Agent Training Camps! The five-star red flag of New China is stained with the blood of countless outstanding Chinese students!
    Today, the American imperialist robbers are about to invade and plunder our motherland again, which has aroused the deep hatred of thousands of Chinese students. They know that it is difficult to build their dignified and beautiful motherland under the threat of American imperialist artillery fire. Wang Shibao, a student at Beijing Agricultural University, said, "I want to change from driving a tractor to driving a tank!" Cao Shengxun, a senior student at Hubei Experimental Middle School, said, "I want to apply to the Air Force Academy instead of Tsinghua University!" His classmate Huang Peiyuan said, "For the sake of my younger siblings being able to study well, let's be a tanker instead of pursuing an engineering career!"
    Naturally, some students also went through some ideological struggles: some were reluctant to leave their warm families, and some were reluctant to give up their ideals of becoming experts in peaceful construction, but they soon realized that without a strong national defense, it would be impossible to guarantee peaceful construction; and experts can be cultivated in any position. Female student Li Zhimin, and many students like her, thought of their mothers day and night, but finally realized: to love mothers, to protect mothers, to protect the mothers of millions of people!
    Many parents and teachers looked at their children's patriotic actions with approving and encouraging smiles. One hundred and forty-two professors at Jiaotong University jointly published a letter to the students, encouraging them to actively participate in military cadre schools. Professor Liang Sicheng and his wife Lin Huiyin from Tsinghua University happily sent their only children to join the army one after another. Zhao Fuxin, a professor at Jiaotong University, sheltered his son's revolutionary activities before liberation and cultivated his son to become a chemical engineer after liberation. Now, he is letting his son apply to military cadre schools. Cha Qian and his wife, the deputy directors of the Wuhan University School Committee, also encouraged their child, Cha Qikai, to participate in military cadre schools. Cha Qian's wife said excitedly at the Wuhan University "December 9th" commemoration meeting: "In order to eliminate war, we must let our children take up arms. In order to protect millions of mothers, we must let our children participate in national defense construction!" Yu Chichang and his wife, the dean of the School of Engineering of the university, agreed to let their two sons, who were studying at Peking University and Wuhan University, sign up for military cadre schools. Yu Chichang's wife said equally excitedly at the same commemoration meeting: "Which mother doesn't love her children? My children are participating in military cadre schools and fulfilling their obligations to the people, which is my glory!"
    For the sake of the motherland, thousands of young students in New China are happily rushing to their glorious posts. In the near future, we can see that this group of young patriots will be trained to become heroic and agile Mao Zedong's Eagles, people's tankers, and navymen, defending the airspace, territorial waters, and sacred frontiers of New China!

    为了祖国！            
    —记青年学生参加军事干部学校的热潮
    本报记者  金凤
    在美帝国主义的侵略火焰的威胁下，我们的祖国向自己的儿女——青年学生和青年工人发出号召：巩固国防力量，参加国防建设！
    在首都，四万大中学生刚从进行了抗美援朝宣传工作的工厂、农村归来，一看到报纸，看见这个号召，便到处跳着、嚷着：“天天等待着的祖国号召，这下子可盼来了！”新中国第一所新型大学——中国人民大学，两千多青年学员报名参加国防建设。清华大学不少学生只怕自己的身体不能合格，马上跑到城里去检查身体。北京大学工学院学生陈寿松的腿有点毛病，他坚决报名参加空军，决心学习“钢铁意志”里苏联无腿飞行员的精神。艺文中学的学生，更加积极地做早操、玩双杠来锻炼身体了。市立第八中学的学生，做游戏的时候，也忘不了摹仿坦克的模型。有着“一二·九”传统的北京学生，一听到祖国号召，他们的血沸腾起来！在正式报名的短短几天内，七千学生踊跃地写下了自己的名字。
    在东北——新中国工业建设的基地和国防的前哨，十二月一日的召唤，特别激动着青年学生奋起保卫祖国的决心。他们不能忘记在日本帝国主义铁蹄下度过的十四年屈辱的日子。解放以后，东北就产生了赵国有、赵桂兰、梁军和田桂英等新中国青年的旗帜！东北学生很知道，只要他们努力，他们完全可以有那同样灿烂的前途。可是现在，鸭绿江边的炮声响了，严重威胁他们将来的希望。必须起来保卫它。据十一月份不完全统计，东北参加军事学校及革命工作的大、中学生，有二万余人。
    在上海，学生们心中还深深刻着美帝滥炸和封锁上海的烙印。育才中学的学生程延年，身上还穿着被美机炸死的父母的丧服。光华大学的学生董阳开，他的被美机炸成残废的母亲还躺在床上。造船厂的残骸还活现在上海学生的面前；被炸死的电力公司工人家属的哭声，还震响在上海学生的耳边。血债需要偿还，强盗要赶出去！上海一万多学生报名参加军校，就是他们对美帝的暴行的有力回答。
    在广州、武汉、重庆、昆明、保定、济南和张家口，每天，几十，几百，几千的学生、青年团员们，在写信给他们的家长、师长和团组织，请求准许他们参加国防建设，做一个人民的空军、海军和坦克手、像苏联的马特洛索夫和阔日杜布一样来保卫自己亲爱的祖国！
    祖国，中国学生是知道怎样来爱，怎样来保护她的！“没有祖国就没有一切”，山东大学的学生喊出了全国千万学生心底的呼声！他们曾眼睁睁看着自己的学校被美军当作兵营。华侨学生刘明芳的母亲和嫂嫂，都活生生被帝国主义者枪杀和烧毙。而东北的学生一年只念七个月的书，要做五个月的苦工，这是在日本帝国主义枪刺下的生活呵！浙江大学工学院毕业生吊死在交通大学的厕所里，是因为中国的工厂被握在帝国主义者的手里，容不了一个真心愿意为祖国服务的工程师！北京大学女生沈崇就在中国的土地上被美军强奸，犯罪的美军皮尔逊却被宣判无罪。
    为着自己亲爱祖国的独立、解放，中国的学生已经进行了三十年的斗争。许多学校都讲得出反动派屠杀他们学生的血债和许多牺牲了的英雄的名字。清华大学的校园里，埋葬着“三、一八”被段祺瑞军阀政府枪杀了的学生尸体；浙江大学学生不能忘记解放前被蒋介石匪帮杀害的学生会主席于子三；交通大学的学生正踏着穆汉祥、史霄云的血迹在前进；昆明学生在十二月一日，刚纪念了五年前殉难的四个烈士；重庆学生在美国特务训练班渣滓洞和白公馆，翻掘出多少他们亲爱伙伴的尸体来！新中国的五星国旗上，是染着中国无数优秀学生的鲜血的！
    今天，美帝国主义强盗又要来侵犯、掠夺我们的祖国了，这就激起了千千万万中国学生的切齿痛恨。他们知道在美帝炮火的威胁下，是很难建设自己庄严美丽的祖国的。北京农业大学学生王士宝说：“我要把驾驶拖拉机改成驾驶战车！”湖北实验中学高三学生曹胜熏说：“我要用投考空军学校来代替投考清华大学！”同班学生黄培元说：“为了弟弟妹妹们能够很好的学习，当一个坦克手来代替工程师的前途吧！”
    自然，有些学生也经过了一些思想斗争的：有的舍不得温暖的家庭，有的舍不得和平建设的专家理想，但他们不久便想通了：假如没有强大的国防建设，就不可能保障和平建设；而专家，在任何岗位上，也都可以培养成的。女学生李志敏以及许多像她一样的学生，日夜想念着妈妈，但毕竟想通了：爱妈妈，要保卫妈妈，要去保卫千万人的妈妈！
    许多家长和师长，是带着赞许的鼓励的微笑，来看待他们孩子的爱国举动的。交通大学一百四十二位教授联名发表告同学书，鼓励他们积极参加军事干部学校。清华大学教授梁思成、林徽因夫妇，高高兴兴送他们仅有的一对儿女先后参加了部队。交通大学的教授赵富鑫，在解放前掩护着儿子的革命活动，解放后在培养着儿子成为一个化学工程师，现在，他让自己儿子投考军事干部学校。武汉大学校委会副主任委员查谦夫妇，也鼓励自己的孩子查其恺参加军事干部学校，查谦夫人在武大“一二、九”纪念会上激动地说：“为了消灭战争必须让我们的孩子去拿起武器。为了保卫千百万个母亲，必须让我们的孩子去参加国防建设！”该校工学院院长余炽昌夫妇同意自己的在北京大学和武汉大学读书的二个儿子报名参加军事干部学校。余炽昌夫人在同一纪念会上同样激动地说：“那个母亲不爱自己的孩子。我的孩子参加军事干部学校，替人民尽义务，是我的光荣！”
    为了祖国，新中国千千万万青年学生，正愉快地奔赴光荣的岗位。在不久的将来，我们可以看到这批青年爱国者，将被锻炼为英勇矫健的毛泽东之鹰，人民的坦克手和海军，捍卫着新中国的领空、领海和神圣边疆！
