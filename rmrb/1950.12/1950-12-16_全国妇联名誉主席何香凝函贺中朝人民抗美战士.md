    He Xiangning, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation
    Sends Letter of Congratulations to Chinese and Korean People's Anti-American Fighters
    [This Newspaper] He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in order to celebrate the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in liberating Pyongyang, and to express the condolences and support of all Chinese women to them, sent letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on December 11.
    The letter to the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteers stated: "You have the opportunity to fight side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army, which is an unparalleled honor. As a result of you and the Korean People's Army living and fighting together on the battlefield, you must be able to deeply experience the close relationship of sharing weal and woe between the Chinese and Korean peoples. The enemy of the Korean people is precisely our enemy. The victory of the Korean people is also our victory. We hope that you will work hard to kill the enemy, thoroughly defeat the American imperialist aggressor group, and build a foundation for world peace.
    The good news from the front that you have liberated Pyongyang has further encouraged the men and women remaining in the rear, who are intensifying their work and study as practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, cooperating with you to inflict painful blows on the enemy.
    A small amount of consolation gifts and a short letter are not enough to express our respect and enthusiasm for you. Our women across the country are determined to stand firm in every different position and vow to be your backing."
    The letter to the Korean People's Army and the guerilla forces behind enemy lines stated: "Your heroic and resolute fighting spirit and your glorious victory in liberating Pyongyang have brought light and hope to the oppressed people all over the world and strengthened the belief and determination of the entire peace and democracy camp. For the independence and freedom of your motherland, you have unswervingly fought, driven out, and annihilated the enemy in every corner of your motherland, fighting bitterly against the American imperialist aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandits. These glorious and heroic deeds fill us with admiration. We hope you will continue to work hard to win the final victory and lasting peace."

    全国妇联名誉主席何香凝
    函贺中朝人民抗美战士
    【本报讯】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员、中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝为了庆贺中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军解放平壤的伟大胜利，为了表示全中国妇女对他们的慰问和支援，于十二月十一日致函中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    致中国人民抗美援朝志愿军的信中说：“你们有机会与英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，实在是无上的光荣。由于你们和朝鲜人民军在战地上朝夕共处的结果，你们一定更能深深地体验到中朝两国人民苦乐与共的亲密关系。朝鲜人民的敌人，正就是我们的敌人。朝鲜人民的胜利，也就是我们的胜利。希望你们努力杀敌，彻底挫败美帝国主义侵略集团，建树世界和平根基。
    从前线传来你们已经解放平壤的捷讯，更鼓舞了留在后方的男女，他们都在以加紧工作，加紧学习，作为抗美援朝，保家卫国的实际行动，配合你们，对敌人予以痛击。
    少许的慰劳品和短短的一封信，并不足以表达对你们的敬爱热诚。我们全国妇女将决心坚守在每个不同的岗位上，誓作你们后盾。”
    致朝鲜人民军和敌后游击队的信中说：“你们英勇坚决的战斗精神和你们解放平壤的辉煌战果，给全世界被压迫的人民带来了光明和希望，加强了整个和平民主阵营的信念和决心。为了你们祖国的独立、自由，你们矢志不渝地分别在祖国的每一个角落，打击、驱逐和歼灭敌人，与美帝国主义侵略者和李承晚匪帮进行苦斗，这些光荣英勇的事迹，使我们万分钦敬，希望你们继续努力，争取最后胜利和持久和平。”
