    On Mao Zedong's Work "On Practice"
    Editorial Department of the Soviet "Pravda"
    Editor's note: The theoretical journal "Bolshevik" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union published in its 23rd issue of 1950, released in December, Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Practice. On the Relation Between Knowledge and Practice—The Relation Between Knowing and Doing." The Chinese Editorial Department's notes pointed out the reasons for Mao Zedong's publication of this philosophical work.

    Within the Communist Party of China, there was a time when some dogmatists rejected the experience of the Chinese revolution, denied the truth that "Marxism is not a dogma but a Guide to Action," and only swallowed isolated words and phrases from Marxist books to scare people. On the other hand, there were also some empiricists who were confined to their own fragmentary experience for a long time, did not understand the importance of theory to revolutionary practice, and could not see the overall situation of the revolution. Although they were working hard—but blindly. Ideological errors, especially the views of dogmatists cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, caused great losses to the Chinese revolution from 1931 to 1934.

    Mao Zedong wrote this work precisely to expose the subjectivist errors of dogmatists and empiricists—especially dogmatists—from the perspective of Marxist epistemology. In his work, Comrade Mao Zedong succinctly and clearly outlined the materialist epistemology—the theory of reflection. In his work, he developed the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialist epistemology, the basic principles of the role of practice in the cognitive process, and the basic principles of the significance of revolutionary theory in actual revolutionary struggle.

    The characteristic of Mao Zedong's work is the combination of profound Marxist analysis of complex philosophical problems with the imagery and vividness of the narrative. The author begins by explaining the role of practice in the cognitive process. He pointed out: pre-Marxist materialism observed the problem of cognition apart from human society and the historical development of mankind, and therefore could not understand the dependence of cognition on social practice, that is, the dependence of cognition on production and class struggle. Because of this, the old materialism was abstract and intuitive. In contrast, the epistemology of dialectical materialism emphasizes the decisive role of practice in cognition.

    Mao Zedong wrote: "First, Marxists believe that human productive activity is the most basic practical activity, and it is what determines all other activities. Human knowledge mainly depends on material productive activity to gradually understand natural phenomena, the nature of nature, the laws of nature, the relationship between man and nature; and through productive activity, people also gradually understand the definite mutual relations between people to varying degrees. All this knowledge cannot be obtained without productive activity."

    "Human productive activity" is the source of the development of human knowledge. However, "human social practice," the author points out, "is not limited to one form of productive activity, but also has many other forms: class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic activities. In short, all fields of social practical life are participated in by social people."

    In explaining the role of practice in cognition, Mao Zedong pointed out that only people's social practice is the criterion of the truthfulness of people's knowledge of the outside world. At the same time, truth is not determined by how it is subjectively felt, but by the results of objective social practice.

    Marxist philosophy firmly rejects any attempt to separate theory from practice and uses every means to implement the principle of the organic unity of theory and practice.

    The author wrote: "The epistemology of dialectical materialism puts practice in the first place, believing that human knowledge cannot be separated from practice at all, and rejects all erroneous theories that deny the importance of practice and separate knowledge from practice." Mao Zedong quoted Lenin's famous instruction: "Practice is higher than (theoretical) knowledge, because it not only has the character of universality, but also the character of direct reality" ("Philosophical Notebooks," 1947 edition, page 185), "The viewpoint of life and practice is the first and basic viewpoint of the epistemology of dialectical materialism." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 14, page 130)

    In summarizing the first part of his work, Mao Zedong explained the two characteristics of dialectical materialism: "Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism, has two most prominent characteristics: one is its class nature, openly declaring that dialectical materialism serves the proletariat; the other is its practicality, emphasizing the dependence of theory on practice, the foundation of theory is practice, and in turn it serves practice." Mao Zedong gave a comprehensive analysis of the two stages of the cognitive process.

    The first stage of cognition, Mao Zedong called the perceptual stage of cognition; that is, the stage of sensation and impression. In the first stage of cognition, people cannot yet form profound concepts and make logical conclusions.

    The second stage of cognition, the higher stage, is rational or logical cognition. The concepts produced in this stage of cognition are the result of generalizing empirical materials, and are the summary of the study of the world. Sensation is a sensual image of things, while concepts are a logical or appropriate image of things.

    From the viewpoint of dialectical materialist epistemology, perceptual cognition belongs to the one-sided, phenomenal, and external connections of things. Logical cognition has taken a big step forward, reaching the whole, essence, and internal connections of things, reaching the exposure of the internal contradictions of the surrounding world, and thus being able to reveal the laws of development of the objective world in the totality of the objective world. Moving from the first stage of cognition to the second stage is moving from the lower to the higher, from the simple to the complex, which is a leap.

    Mao Zedong wrote: "The continuation of social practice causes people to repeatedly experience the things that cause sensation and impression in practice, and thus a leap in the cognitive process occurs in people's minds, producing concepts. Concepts are no longer the phenomena of things, nor the various aspects of things, nor their external connections, but have grasped the essence of things, the whole of things, and the internal connections of things. Concepts and sensations are not only different in quantity, but also in quality. Continuing in this way, using the methods of judgment and reasoning, logical conclusions can be produced." "The real task of cognition lies in reaching thinking through sensation, reaching a gradual understanding of the internal contradictions of objective things, understanding its laws, understanding the internal connections between this process and that process, that is, reaching logical cognition."

    Mao Zedong pointed out that before Marxism, no one had ever solved the theory of the development process of cognition based on practice and progressing from the shallow to the deep in this way. Marxist philosophical materialism was the first to correctly solve this problem, pointing out that perceptual cognition and rational cognition are different stages in the unified process of knowing the outside world, and these two stages are not separated from each other, but are unified on the basis of human social and historical practice.

    Moving from the first stage of cognition to the second stage is "the movement of people in their complex and frequently repeated practice of production and class struggle, from perceptual cognition to the transition of logical cognition."

    In the process of moving from the concrete to the abstract and from perceptual cognition to rational cognition, as long as thinking is correct, it will not deviate from the truth, but will approach the truth.

    In developing his view of the role of abstraction in the cognitive process, Mao Zedong based himself on Lenin's famous principle: "The abstraction of matter, the abstraction of natural laws, the abstraction of value, and so on, in a word, all scientific (correct, serious, non-nonsense) abstractions reflect nature more profoundly, more correctly, and more completely." ("Philosophical Notebooks," page 146).

    Mao Zedong, in expounding the dialectical unity of perceptual cognition and rational cognition based on practice, cited some easily understandable and vivid examples... He wrote: "Our practice proves that we cannot immediately understand what we have sensed; only what we have understood can we feel more deeply. ... Whoever wants to know something must contact that thing, that is, live (practice) in the environment of that thing, and there is no way to solve it. It is impossible to know the laws of capitalist society in advance in feudal society, because capitalism has not yet appeared, and there is no such practice. Marxism can only be the product of capitalist society. Marx could not concretely know in advance some of the specific laws of the era of imperialism in the era of free capitalism, because imperialism, the final stage of capitalism, had not yet arrived, and there was no such practice; only Lenin and Stalin could undertake this task."

    Mao Zedong pointed out that all true knowledge originates from experience. Experience is nothing more than two parts: direct experience or personal experience and indirect experience (that is, the social and historical experience of mankind). The most ridiculous are those "knowledgeable people" who, with a smattering of hearsay, crown themselves as "the best in the world." The author emphasizes the necessity of personal experience for direct knowledge. The source of any knowledge lies in the feeling of the objective external world by human physical senses; denying direct experience means he is not a materialist.

    The author wrote: "If you want to directly know a certain thing or things, you can only participate in the struggle to change reality and change a certain thing or things in practice, in order to touch the phenomenon of that thing or things, and only by personally participating in the struggle to change reality in practice can you expose the essence of that thing or things and understand them. ... If you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and eat it yourself. If you want to know the organization and properties of an atom, you must carry out physical and chemical experiments to change the situation of the atom. If you want to know the theory and method of revolution, you must participate in the revolution."

    Mao Zedong said that in the process of cognition, people also rely on indirect experience, that is, rely on the social and historical practice of many generations of mankind, because this is the product of the direct experience of all ethnic groups. However, the knowledge gained in the past is reliable only when it conforms to Lenin's requirements, that is, when it is a correct and scientific abstraction. Mao Zedong then turned to analyze some examples that illustrate the movement of cognition. The following is one of these examples.

    "The proletariat's understanding of capitalist society, in the early stage of its practice—the period of destroying machines and spontaneous struggle, they were only in the stage of perceptual cognition, only recognizing the one-sidedness of various phenomena of capitalism and their external connections. At this time, they were still a so-called "class in itself". But when they reached the second stage of their practice—the period of conscious and organized economic and political struggle, due to practice, due to the experience of long-term struggle, after Marx and Engels used scientific methods to sum up these experiences, the theory of Marxism was produced to educate the proletariat, thus enabling the proletariat to understand the essence of capitalist society, understand the exploitative relations of social classes, and understand the historical tasks of the proletariat, at this time they became a 'class for itself'."

    Mao Zedong, in developing the materialist epistemology, carried out a thorough struggle against idealists.

    "In the history of philosophy, there is a school called 'rationalism', which only recognizes the reality of reason and does not recognize the reality of experience, thinking that only reason is reliable, and that sensory experience is unreliable. The mistake of this school lies in inverting the facts. The reason why rational things are reliable is precisely because they originate from sensation, otherwise rational things will become water without a source, a tree without roots, and only subjective self-generated unreliable things."

    Mao Zedong wrote: "In terms of the order of the cognitive process, sensory experience is the first thing. We emphasize the significance of social practice in the cognitive process because only social practice can make human cognition begin to occur and begin to obtain sensory experience from the objective outside world."

    Mao Zedong declared: "Vulgar practicalists are not like this. They respect experience and look down on theory, and therefore cannot have a comprehensive view of the entire objective process, lack clear direction, have no grand prospects, and are complacent about their small successes and narrow views. If this kind of person guides the revolution, they will lead the revolution to a dead end."

    Mao Zedong made the following important conclusion: "Rational cognition depends on perceptual cognition, and perceptual cognition needs to be developed to rational cognition. This is the epistemology of dialectical materialism." Secondly, "The cognitive movement of dialectical materialism from sensation to reason is the same for a small cognitive process (such as the cognition of a thing or a task) as it is for a large cognitive process (such as the cognition of a society or a revolution)."

    The author comprehensively examines the epistemology of dialectical materialism and demonstrates and develops each principle. After making a detailed analysis of the two basic stages of cognition, Mao Zedong pointed out that the movement of cognition has not yet ended here. He wrote: "If the cognitive movement of dialectical materialism only reaches rational cognition, then only half of the problem has been discussed. And as far as Marxist philosophy is concerned, only the less important half has been discussed."

    The most important thing is to apply knowledge and theory in practical activities, in the struggle to revolutionize the world. Mao Zedong wrote: "Knowledge begins with practice, and after obtaining theoretical knowledge through practice, it must return to practice." This is completely consistent with Lenin's principle of understanding objective reality through the dialectical path from living intuition to abstract thinking, and then from abstract thinking to practice.

    Mao Zedong particularly emphasized the active role of cognition and the significance of revolutionary theory as a guide to action. From the Marxist point of view, the mission of theory is not to understand the laws of the objective world and thus be able to explain them, but to use this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world. Theory should guide action. "The active role of cognition is not only manifested in the active leap from perceptual cognition to rational cognition, but more importantly, it must also be manifested in the leap from rational cognition to revolutionary practice. The knowledge that grasps the laws of the world must be returned to the practice of transforming the world, and reused in the practice of production, the practice of revolutionary class struggle and national struggle, and the practice of scientific experiments. This is the process of testing theory and developing theory, and it is the continuation of the entire cognitive process."

    Mao Zedong, starting from the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, clearly and profoundly pointed out the significance of revolutionary theory for the practical activities of the Communist Party. He wrote: "In Marxism's view, theory is important, and its importance is fully manifested in a sentence Lenin said: 'Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.'" However, the author pointed out that theory can be of great significance only if it can guide action. If theory is just empty talk, put on a high shelf, and not implemented, then even the best theory is meaningless. Mao Zedong quoted Stalin's excellent words: "Theory divorced from practice is empty theory, and practice divorced from theory is blind practice." ("Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 6, pages 88-89)

    The truthfulness and correctness of theory can only be determined by the test of practice. Only practice can prove whether theory can achieve the intended purpose. Marxism-Leninism is the only correct revolutionary theory, the ideological weapon of the liberation struggle of the working masses, and its significance has been tested and verified by the revolutionary practice of the Russian proletariat and the experience of the international revolutionary movement.

    "Marxism-Leninism is called truth not only because Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and others scientifically constructed these doctrines, but also because they have been confirmed by the practice of revolutionary class struggle and national struggle since then. Dialectical materialism is a universal truth because it cannot escape its scope through the practice of anyone."

    In the last part of his work, Mao Zedong developed the principles of Marxism-Leninism on absolute truth and relative truth, and the principles of the unity of objective things and subjective things in cognition.

    Mao Zedong raised the question of whether the cognitive movement is completed when it reaches practice, and his answer is: "Completed, and not completed." If the intended purpose can be achieved, that is, the predetermined ideas, theories, plans, and programs are transformed into reality, or substantially transformed into reality, then "the cognitive movement for this specific process is considered to be completed."

    "However," the author pointed out, "generally speaking, whether in the practice of changing nature or changing society, there are very few cases where people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs are realized without any change. ... Many times, many repeated failures are required to correct erroneous cognition, to reach conformity with the laws of the objective process, and thus to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, to obtain the expected results in practice. But in any case, at this time, people's cognitive movement for a certain objective process in a certain stage of development is considered to be completed." However, from the perspective of the development of the objective process, people's cognitive movement has not been completed. Any process, whether belonging to nature or society, is moving forward and developing due to internal contradictions and struggles, and people's cognitive movement should also move and develop accordingly.

    Mao Zedong used social movement to illustrate the completion and non-completion of human cognition, and made an important conclusion: "True revolutionary leaders must not only be good at correcting their ideas, theories, plans, and programs when they are wrong, as mentioned above, but also be good at making themselves and all those participating in the revolution also shift and change in subjective cognition when a certain objective process has shifted and changed from one stage of development to another, that is, to make the proposal of new revolutionary tasks and new work programs suitable for the changes in the new situation. The changes in the situation during the revolutionary period are very rapid. If the cognition of revolutionaries cannot change rapidly with it, they cannot lead the revolution to victory."

    The author pointed out that the separation of the subjective from the objective and the separation of theory from practice are the characteristics of idealism and mechanical materialism, right-leaning opportunism and "left-leaning" adventurism.

    The ideological characteristics of the diehards who are manifested as right-leaning opportunists are detachment from reality, turning theory into dead dogma, and leaving practical life. ... The author pointed out: "We oppose the diehards in the revolutionary ranks whose ideas cannot advance with the changed objective situation, and in history, they are manifested as right-leaning opportunism. ... Their ideas are divorced from social practice. They cannot stand at the head of the social wheel and act as guides. They only know how to follow behind the car and complain that the car is moving too fast, trying to pull it backward and drive backwards."

    Mao Zedong continued: "We also oppose 'left' wing empty talkers. Their ideas exceed a certain stage of development of the objective process. Some regard illusions as truth, while others forcibly place ideals that only have realistic possibilities in the future into the present to do, leaving the practice of the majority of people at present, leaving the current reality, and in action, they are manifested as adventurism."

    The epistemology of Marxism-Leninism is characterized by scientific practice—the unity of theory and practice. It firmly opposes the erroneous and hostile ideas of right-leaning opportunists and "left-leaning" adventurists.

    Mao Zedong profoundly explained and developed the famous Engels and Lenin's principles on absolute truth and relative truth, and the principle of the consistency of objective things and subjective things. "Marxists admit that in the absolute overall development process of the universe, the development of each specific process is relative, so in the long river of absolute truth, people's understanding of specific processes in each certain stage of development only has relative truthfulness. The sum of countless relative truths is absolute truth. The development of the objective process is a development full of contradictions and struggles. The development of human cognitive movement is also a development full of contradictions and struggles. ... The process of occurrence, development and demise in social practice is endless, and the process of occurrence, development and demise of human cognition is also endless. ... The movement of change in the objective real world will never end, and people's understanding of truth in practice will never end. Marxism-Leninism has not ended the truth, but is constantly opening up the road to understanding the truth in practice. Our conclusion is the concrete historical unity of the subjective and the objective, theory and practice, knowing and doing, and we oppose all 'left' or right erroneous ideas that deviate from concrete history."

    Mao Zedong firmly believes in the historical mission and creative power of the working class and its Communist Party. He said that history has placed the responsibility of correctly understanding the world and revolutionizing the world squarely on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party. "A part of the earth has already implemented this transformation, and this is the Soviet Union. They are still promoting this transformation process. The Chinese people and the people of the world are also undergoing or will undergo such a transformation process."

    The author summarizes all the basic principles of the examined dialectical materialist epistemology into a brief conclusion: "Discover the truth through practice, and then confirm the truth and develop the truth through practice. Actively develop from perceptual cognition to rational cognition, and then actively guide revolutionary practice from rational cognition to transform the subjective world and the objective world. Practice, cognition, re-practice, re-cognition, this form, cycles back and forth to infinity, and the content of each cycle of practice and cognition is comparatively advanced to a higher level. This is the entire epistemology of dialectical materialism, and this is the view of the unity of knowing and doing in dialectical materialism."

    The broad Soviet scientific community will read Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" with great interest.

    论毛泽东的著作《实践论》
    苏联真理报编辑部
    编者按：苏联共产党中央的理论刊物《布尔什维克》杂志在今年十二月出版的一九五○年第二十三期译载了毛泽东同志的著作《实践论》。随后苏联共产党中央机关报《真理报》在十二月十八日发表了一篇题为“论毛泽东的著作《实践论》”的编辑部论文，对于毛泽东同志的这篇著作加以论述。兹译其全文如下：
    《布尔什维克》杂志第二十三期发表了毛泽东同志在一九三七年所写的哲学著作《实践论。论认识和实践的关系——知和行的关系》。在中文编辑部的注释中指出了毛泽东发表这一哲学著作的原因。
    在中国共产党内，有一个时候曾经有过一些教条主义者，他们拒绝中国革命的经验，否认“马克思主义不是教条而是行动的指南”这个真理，而只生吞活剥马克思主义书籍中的只言片语，去吓唬人们。另一方面，也有过一些经验主义者，他们长期拘守于自身的片断经验，不了解理论对于革命实践的重要性，看不见革命的全局，虽然也是辛苦地——但却是盲目地在工作。思想的错误，特别是披着马克思列宁主义外衣的教条主义者的观点，曾经在一九三一年至一九三四年使得中国革命受了极大的损失。
    毛泽东写这一著作，正是为了用马克思主义的认识论观点去揭露教条主义者和经验主义者——特别是教条主义者的主观主义错误。毛泽东同志在其著作中简洁和明晰地概述了唯物论的认识论——反映论。在他的著作中，发展了马克思列宁主义关于辩证唯物论的认识的基本原理、关于实践在认识过程中的作用的基本原理、关于革命理论在实际革命斗争中的意义的基本原理。
    毛泽东这一著作的特点就是：对复杂哲学问题的深刻的马克思主义的分析与叙述的形象性和鲜明性结合在一起。作者一开始就说明了实践在认识过程中的作用。他指出道：马克思以前的唯物论，离开人类社会，离开人类的历史发展，去观察认识问题，因此不能了解认识对社会实践的依赖关系，即认识对生产与阶级斗争的依赖关系。正因为如此，所以旧的唯物论是抽象的、直观的。相反地，辩证唯物论的认识论却强调实践在认识中的决定作用。
    毛泽东写道：“首先，马克思主义者认为人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然的现象、自然的性质、自然的规律性、人与自然的关系；而且经过生产活动，也在各种不同程度上逐渐地认识了人与人的一定的相互关系。一切这些知识，离开生产活动是不能得到的。”
    “人的生产活动”是人的认识发展的来源。可是“人的社会实践，——作者指出，——不限于生产活动一种形式，还有多种其他的形式，阶级斗争，政治生活，科学和艺术的活动。总之，社会实际生活的一切领域都是社会的人所参加的。”
    在说明实践在认识中的作用时，毛泽东指出：只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对外界认识的真理性的标准。同时，真理不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。
    马克思主义的哲学坚决排斥把理论从实践割裂开来的任何企图，用一切办法贯彻理论与实践的有机统一的原则。
    作者写道：“辩证唯物论的认识论把实践提到第一的地位，认为人的认识一点也不能离开实践，排斥一切否认实践重要性、使认识离开实践的错误理论。”毛泽东引证了列宁的著名指示：“实践高于（理论的）认识，因为它不但有普遍性的品格，而且还有直接现实性的品格”（《哲学笔记》，一九四七年版，第一八五页），“生活与实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之第一的与基本的观点”。（《列宁全集》，第十四卷，第一三○页）
    毛泽东在总结其著作的第一部分时，说明了辩证唯物论的两个特点：“马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。”毛泽东对认识过程的两个阶段作了一个全面的分析。
    认识的第一个阶段，毛泽东叫作认识的感性阶段；就是感觉与印象的阶段。在认识的第一个阶段中，人们还不能造成深刻的概念，作出合乎论理（即合乎逻辑）的结论。
    认识的第二阶段、更高的阶段，是理性的或论理的认识。在这个认识阶段中所产生的概念是经验材料概括化的结果，是研究世界的总结。感觉是事物的感性的映象，概念则是事物的论理的或适当的映象。
    从辩证唯物论的认识论观点看来，感性的认识是属于事物之片面的、现象的、外部联系的东西。论理的认识则推进了一大步，到达了事物的全体的、本质的、内部联系的东西，到达了暴露周围世界的内在的矛盾，因而能在客观世界的总体上去揭露客观世界的发展规律。从认识的第一阶段进到第二阶段，是从较低的东西进到较高的东西，从简单的东西进到复杂的东西，是突变。
    毛泽东写道：“社会实践的继续，使人们在实践中引起感觉与印象的东西反复了多次，于是在人们的脑子里生起了一个认识过程中的突变，产生了概念。概念这种东西已经不是事物的现象，不是事物的各个片面，不是它们的外部联系，而是抓着了事物的本质，事物的全体，事物的内部联系了。概念同感觉，不但是数量上的差别，而且有了性质上的差别。循此继进，使用判断与推理的方法，就可产生出合乎论理的结论来。”“认识的真正任务在于经过感觉而到达于思维，到达于逐步了解客观事物的内部矛盾，了解它的规律性，了解这一过程与那一过程间的内部联系，即达到于论理的认识。”
    毛泽东指出：基于实践的由浅入深的辩证唯物论的关于认识发展过程的理论，在马克思主义以前是没有一个人这样解决过的。马克思主义的哲学唯物论，第一次正确地解决了这个问题，指出感性的认识和理性的认识是认识外界的统一过程中的不同的阶段，这两个阶段不是互相分离的，是在人类社会历史的实践基础上统一起来的。
    从认识的第一阶段进到第二阶段，就是“人在他们的生产与阶级斗争的复杂的、经常反复的实践中，由感性认识到论理认识的推移的运动”。
    在从具体进到抽象、从感性认识进到理性认识的过程中，思维只要是正确的，它就不会离开真理，而是接近于真理。
    毛泽东在发展他对抽象在认识过程中的作用的观点时，是立足于列宁的这个著名原理：“物质的抽象，自然规律的抽象，价值的抽象及其他等等，一句话，那一切科学的（正确的，郑重的，非瞎说的）抽象，都更深刻，更正确，更完全地反映了自然。”（《哲学笔记》，第一四六页）。
    毛泽东在阐明基于实践的感性认识与理性认识的辩证统一时，举了一些很容易了解的生动的例子……他写道：“我们的实践证明：感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。……无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。不能在封建社会就预先认识资本主义社会的规律，因为资本主义还未出现，还无这种实践。马克思主义只能是资本主义社会的产物。马克思不能在自由资本主义时代就预先具体地认识帝国主义时代的某些特异的规律，因为帝国主义这个资本主义最后阶段还未到来，还无这种实践，只有列宁和斯大林才能担当此项任务。”
    毛泽东指出道：一切真正的知识都是从经验发源的。经验则不外是直接经验或亲身经验与间接经验（即人类的社会历史经验）两部分。最可笑的是那些“知识里手”，有了道听途说的一知半解，便自封为“天下第一”。作者强调亲身经验对于直接认识的必要性。任何知识的来源，在于人的肉体感官对客观外界的感觉，否认了直接经验，他就不是唯物论者。
    作者写道：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。你要知道原子的组织同性质，你就得实行物理学和化学的实验，变革原子的情况。你要知道革命的理论与方法，你就得参加革命。”
    毛泽东说：人在认识的过程中也依赖于间接经验，即依赖于人类许多世代的社会历史实践，因为这是各族人民直接经验的产物。但过去所得到的知识，只有当它们符合于列宁的要求，即它们是正确的、科学的抽象时，它们才是可靠的。毛泽东又转而分析那些说明认识运动的一些例子。下面就是这些例子中的一个。
    “无产阶级对于资本主义社会的认识，在其实践的初期——破坏机器与自发斗争时期，他们还只在感性认识的阶段，只认识资本主义各个现象的片面及其外部的联系。这时，他们还是一个所谓“自在的阶级”。但是到了他们实践的第二个时期——有意识有组织的经济斗争与政治斗争的时期，由于实践，由于长期斗争的经验，经过马克思、恩格斯用科学的方法把这种种经验总结起来，产生了马克思主义的理论，用以教育无产阶级，这样就使无产阶级理解了资本主义社会的本质，理解了社会阶级的剥削关系，理解了无产阶级的历史任务，这时他们就变成了一个‘自为的阶级’。”
    毛泽东在发展唯物论的认识论时，向唯心论者进行了彻底的斗争。
    “哲学史上有所谓‘唯理论’一派，就是只承认理性的实在性，不承认经验的实在性，以为只有理性靠得住，而感觉的经验是靠不住的。这一派的错误在于颠倒了事实。理性的东西所以靠得住，正是由于它来源于感性，否则理性的东西就成了无源之水，无本之木，而只是主观自生的靠不住的东西了。”
    毛泽东写道：“从认识过程的秩序说来，感觉经验是第一的东西，我们强调社会实践在认识过程中的意义，就在于只有社会实践才能使人的认识开始发生，开始从客观外界得到感觉经验。”
    毛泽东宣称：“庸俗的事务主义家不是这样，他们尊重经验而看轻理论，因而不能通观客观过程的全体，缺乏明确的方针，没有远大的前途，沾沾自喜于一得之功与一孔之见。这种人如果指导革命，就会引导革命走上碰壁的地步。”
    毛泽东作出下列的重要结论：“理性认识依赖于感性认识，感性认识有待于发展到理性认识，这就是辩证唯物论的认识论。”其次，“由感性到理性之辩证唯物论的认识运动，对于一个小的认识过程（例如对于一个事物或一件工作的认识）是如此，对于一个大的认识过程（例如对于一个社会或一个革命的认识）也是如此。”
    作者全面地考察了辩证唯物论的认识论，并且论证和发展了每一个原理。在把认识的两个基本阶段加以详细的分析后，毛泽东指出：认识运动至此还没有完结。他写道：“辩证唯物论的认识运动，如果只到理性认识为止，那末还只说到问题的一半。而且对于马克思主义的哲学说来，还只说到非十分重要的那一半。”
    最重要的是在实践活动中、在革命地改造世界的斗争中，应用知识和理论。毛泽东写道：“认识从实践始，经过实践得到了理论的认识，还须再回到实践去。”这和列宁关于通过从活的直觉到抽象思维、再从抽象思维到实践的辩证途径来认识客观实在的原理，是完全一致的。
    毛泽东特别强调认识的能动作用，革命理论之作为行动的指南的意义。从马克思主义的观点看来，理论的使命不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释它们，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。理论应当指导行动。“认识的能动作用，不但表现于从感性的认识到理性的认识之能动的飞跃，更重要的还须表现于从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃。抓着了世界的规律性的认识，必须把它再回到改造世界的实践中去，再用到生产的实践、革命的阶级斗争与民族斗争的实践以及科学实验的实践中去。这就是检验理论与发展理论的过程，是整个认识过程的继续。”
    毛泽东从列宁和斯大林的指示出发，明白和深刻地指出了革命理论对于共产党的实践活动的意义。他写道：“在马克思主义看来，理论是重要的，它的重要性充分地表现在列宁说过的一句话：‘没有革命的理论就没有革命的运动。’”然而作者指出：理论要能够指导行动，才会有很大的意义。理论如果只是空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那么这种理论再好也是没有意义的。毛泽东引证了斯大林这句卓越的话：“离开实践的理论是空洞的理论，离开理论的实践是盲目的实践。”（《斯大林全集》，第六卷，第八八——八九页）
    理论的真理性、正确性，只有依据实践的检验来决定。只有实践才能证明理论是否能够达到预想的目的。马克思列宁主义是唯一正确的革命理论，是劳动群众解放斗争的思想武器，它的意义是由俄国无产阶级的革命实践与国际革命运动的经验所检验过和证实了的。
    “马克思列宁主义之所以被称为真理，也不但在于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林等人科学地构成这些学说的时候，而且在于为尔后革命的阶级斗争与民族斗争的实践所证实的时候。辩证唯物论之所以为普遍真理，在于经过无论什么人的实践都不能逃出它的范围。”
    毛泽东在其著作的最后一部分，发展了马克思列宁主义关于绝对真理与相对真理的原理、关于客观东西与主观东西在认识中的统一的原理。
    毛泽东提出了认识运动达到实践是否就算完成了的问题，他的答复是：“完成了，又没有完成。”如果能够达到预想的目的，即将预定的思想、理论、计划、方案变为现实，或者大体上变为事实，那末，“对于这一具体过程的认识运动算是完成了”。
    “然而，——作者指出，——一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。……许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。但是不管怎样，到了这种时候，人们对于在某一发展阶段内的某一客观过程的认识运动，算是完成了。”但是，从客观过程的发展看来，人们的认识运动是没有完成的。任何过程，不论是属于自然界的与属于社会的，由于内部的矛盾与斗争，都是向前推移向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应跟着推移与发展。
    毛泽东依据社会运动来说明人的认识的完成与没有完成，并且作出重要的结论：“真正的革命指导者，不但在于当自己的思想、理论、计划、方案有错误时，须得善于改正，如同上面已经说到的，而且在于当某一客观过程已经从某一发展阶段向另一发展阶段推移转变的时候，须得善于使自己及参加革命的一切人员在主观认识上也跟着推移转变，即是要使新的革命任务与新的工作方案的提出，适合于新的情况的变化。革命时期情况的变化是很急速的，如果革命党人的认识不能随之而急速变化，就不能引导革命走向胜利。”
    作者指出：主观和客观相分裂，理论和实践相脱离，是唯心论与机械唯物论、右倾机会主义与“左倾”冒险主义的特点。
    表现为右倾机会主义者的顽固派，其思想的特点是脱离现实，把理论变成死的教条，离开实际生活。……作者指出：“我们反对革命队伍中的顽固派，他们的思想不能随变化了的客观情况而前进，在历史上表现为右倾机会主义。……他们的思想离开了社会的实践，他们不能站在社会车轮的前头充任向导的工作，他们只知跟在车子后面怨恨车子走得太快了，企图把它向后拉，开倒车。”
    毛泽东继续道：“我们也反对‘左’翼空谈主义。他们的思想超过客观过程的一定发展阶段，有些把幼想看作真理，有些则把仅在将来有现实可能性的理想，勉强地放在现时来做，离开了当前大多数人的实践，离开了当前的现实性，在行动上表现为冒险主义。”
    马克思列宁主义的认识论，其特点是科学的实践——理论与实践的统一，它坚决反对右倾机会主义者和“左倾”冒险主义者的错误的敌对思想。
    毛泽东深刻地说明了和发展了著名的恩格斯和列宁关于绝对真理和相对真理的原理、关于客观东西和主观东西的一致性的原理。“马克思主义者承认在绝对的总的宇宙发展过程中，各个具体过程的发展都是相对的，因而在绝对真理的长河中，人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识只具有相对的真理性。无数相对的真理之总和，就是绝对的真理。客观过程的发展是充满着矛盾与斗争的发展。人的认识运动的发展也是充满着矛盾与斗争的发展。……社会实践中的发生、发展与消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展与消灭的过程也是无穷的。……客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。马克思列宁主义并没有结束真理，而是在实践中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。我们的结论是主观与客观、理论与实践、知与行的具体的历史的统一，反对一切离开具体历史的“左”的或右的错误思想。”
    毛泽东十分相信工人阶级及其共产党的历史使命与创造力量，他说：历史已经把正确地认识世界与革命地改造世界的责任正好放在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。“地球上已经有一部分实行了这种改造，这就是苏联。他们还正在促进这种改造过程。中国人民与世界人民也都正在或将要通过这样的改造过程。”
    作者把所考察过的辩证唯物论的认识论的一切基本原理归结为一个简短的结论：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理与发展真理。从感性认识而能动地发展到理性认识，又从理性认识而能动地指导革命实践，改造主观世界与客观世界。实践，认识，再实践，再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践与认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。这就是辩证唯物论的全部认识论，这就是辩证唯物论的知行统一观。”
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》这一论文，广大的苏联科学界将带着极大的兴趣来阅读。
