    Regarding Matters of Handling Students Returning from Abroad

    Editor:
    (1) Does the government currently have a specialized agency for handling matters related to students returning from abroad?
    (2) How can newly returned students from abroad contact the government?

                                Wang Qi

    Wang Qi:
    (1) The Committee for Handling Matters of Students Returning from Abroad (under the leadership of the Central Committee of Culture and Education) was established in December 1949, specifically responsible for handling various issues related to students returning from abroad, such as contacting students abroad, registering and receiving students returning to China, and introducing them to work. The daily work of this committee is handled by the Fourth Section of the Higher Education Department of the Central Ministry of Education. For any questions, you can contact this section directly.
    (2) Newly returned students from abroad can go to the committee (or the Fourth Section of the Higher Education Department of the Central Ministry of Education) to submit verification documents and register. There is no need for others to handle this on your behalf before returning to China.

    关于办理留学生回国事编者同志：
    （一）政府现在是否设有专门办理留学生回国事务的机构？
    （二）新回国的留学生如何与政府取得联系？
                                王琦王琦君：
    （一）办理留学生回国事务委员会（属中央文教委员会领导）已于一九四九年十二月成立，专门负责处理有关留学生回国的各项问题，如与国外留学生的联系，留学生回国后的登记、招待及介绍工作等。该会的经常工作由中央教育部高教司第四处代办，有问题可迳向该处联系。（二）新回国留学生可至该会（或中央教育部高教司第四处）交验证明文件，办理登记。回国前毋需由他人代办。
