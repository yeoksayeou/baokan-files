    Boldly Arousing the Masses Under Leadership
    Land Reform in East and Central South China is Expanding Comprehensively
    Land Reform Area in the Two Regions Has Expanded to Over 420 Counties

    East China
    [Xinhua News Agency Shanghai, 9th] The large-scale land reform movement is comprehensively expanding in the vast rural areas of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, both south and north of the river, in the East China region.

    Throughout East China, a total of over 176,000 land reform work cadres were trained between this summer and autumn, including over 90,000 cadres from Party, government, and farmers' associations above the township level in various provinces and administrative regions, and 80,000 land reform work team cadres. The work teams also included people from various democratic parties and a large number of revolutionary young intellectuals. Before the end of October, all the work teams had successively gone to the countryside and were distributed throughout East China. The farmers' associations in various places have been strengthened after rectification, and the total number of members in the region has increased from more than 21 million to more than 23.89 million. In order to quickly complete land reform, East China has expanded the areas where land reform will be implemented this winter and next spring. The area where land reform will be completed before the end of March next year has been expanded from the originally planned 178 counties, with more than 46 million agricultural population, to 246 counties, with more than 63 million agricultural population. Only some areas in Fujian and the flood-stricken areas in northern Anhui, with a population of about 17 million, will be implemented after the autumn of next year.

    This summer, East China had already conducted land reform trials in individual townships in Songjiang County in southern Jiangsu and Jiaxing County in Zhejiang Province. In August and September, each county that decided to implement land reform this winter selected typical townships, concentrated their efforts, and began trials one after another. By the end of October, 422 townships that had been piloted for land reform had completed the distribution of land. Work teams in various places have gained experience. At this point, the movement gradually expanded from the key pilot townships to the surrounding areas, and some work teams separated cadres and transferred to other townships to mobilize the masses. In this way, the land reform movement began to unfold in various parts of East China. As of November 18, 1,183 townships had completed the distribution of land, and 1,004 townships were in progress. At present, the land reform movement in East China is expanding comprehensively in a way that combines points and surfaces.

    The progress of the land reform movement in East China is smooth and rapid, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers is extremely high. The land reform movement will spread throughout the new areas of East China with greater momentum before the new year. After gaining experience in preparation and trial implementation, various places are emphasizing boldly arousing the peasant masses under leadership, so as to carry out the struggle of millions of peasant masses against feudalism and complete land reform.

    Central South

    [Xinhua News Agency Hankou] The land reform movement in the provinces of the Central South region has been gradually unfolded according to the implementation plan. According to the work base and the preparation for land reform, the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have submitted to the Central South Military and Political Committee for approval to appropriately expand the areas where land reform will be implemented this winter and next spring. The area where land reform is about to be implemented in the entire Central South region has been expanded from the originally planned 161 counties with approximately 50 million agricultural population, to more than 180 counties with 60 million population. The area where land reform is implemented in Hubei Province was originally 23 counties with a population of about 7 million, now expanded to 410,000 with a population of 14.2 million. Jiangxi Province was originally 44 counties with a population of about 7 million, now expanded to 51 counties (of which 14 counties only implement land reform in some areas) with a population of 9.7 million. Hunan Province was originally 31 counties with a population of about 17 million, now expanded to 35 counties with a population of more than 19 million. Only 43 counties in Henan Province have not completed land reform, so it is still 43 counties. In Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, the conditions for land reform are not yet mature because the bandits have not been completely eliminated, and no expansion has been made. Land reform in Guangxi Province is implemented in more than ten counties in Guilin, Nanning and other special districts, and Guangdong Province remains in Meixian, Xingning, and Jieyang counties.

    Since liberation, the vast rural areas of the provinces in the Central South region have generally undergone struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent in the past year, and farmers' associations have been established from top to bottom. The organized peasants in the above-mentioned areas implementing land reform can account for an average of 20% to 30% of the total rural population. Especially after the rectification in summer and autumn, the peasant organizations have become more united and consolidated, and the membership composition is purer than before. In September, after the Central South Military and Political Committee approved the plan for implementing land reform in the above-mentioned areas, the people's governments of Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Henan provinces and the leading organs of the Chinese Communist Party began specific preparations on the basis of existing work. The provinces held people's representative conferences at all levels, with the implementation steps and plans of land reform as the main topics. The organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in various places also held representative meetings of party members to study relevant land reform policies and conduct summary work in the form of criticism and self-criticism to correct policies and improve work style. After all aspects of preparation, the leading organs of land reform in the provinces, special zones, and counties - the Land Reform Committees - have been established one after another. Ten thousand cadres participating in land reform in the entire region have also been largely trained. In addition, key townships have been selected everywhere to conduct land reform experiments. New cadres who have been trained and veteran cadres with rich work experience have learned while working in typical trials and have gained a lot. This will have a huge significance in promoting the large-scale land reform movement.

    At present, the land reform movement in various parts of the Central South region has gradually expanded from point to surface on the basis of key experiments. The above-mentioned areas implementing land reform will be completed in a planned and phased manner this winter and next spring. Henan Province plans to complete 29 counties in the first phase. In Hunan Province, in addition to the 54 townships that have been completed, the land reform of 500 townships in the first stage can be completed before the end of the year. After the completion of the experimental work in the first batch of 184 townships in Jiangxi Province, the movement is being launched on a large scale. It is expected that the land reform movement in various places can be basically completed before the spring plowing next year.

    有领导地大胆放手发动群众
    华东中南土地改革正向全面展开
    两区土改面积已扩大为四百二十余县
    华东
    【新华社上海九日电】大规模的土地改革运动，在华东区长江下游江南江北的广大农村中，正在向全面展开中。
    华东全区，在今年夏秋之间，共训练土地改革工作干部达十七万六千多人，包括各省各行政区乡级以上的党、政府和农民协会的干部九万多人，土地改革工作队干部八万人。工作队中并有各民主党派的人士和大批的革命青年知识分子。十月底以前，所有的工作队都已先后下乡，分布于华东各地。各地农民协会经过整顿已有加强，全区会员由二千一百多万人已增至二千三百八十九万人。为了迅速完成土地改革，华东区已将今冬明春实行土地改革的地区予以扩大。明年三月底前完成土地改革的地区，已由原定一百七十八县，四千六百多万农业人口的地区，扩展为二百四十六县，六千三百多万农业人口的地区。只有福建部分地区和皖北水灾区约一千七百万人口的地区，留待明年的秋后实行。
    今年夏天，华东就已在苏南区松江县和浙江省嘉兴县的个别乡试办土地改革。八、九月间，决定今冬实行土地改革的各个县份，都选择典型的乡，集中力量，先后开始试办。到十月底，四百二十二个试办土地改革的乡都完成了分配土地。各地工作队都取得了经验。至此，运动便由试办的重点乡向周围地区逐渐展开，有的工作队就分出干部转到另外的乡去发动群众。这样，土地改革运动就在华东各地都开始展开起来。截至十一月十八日，已有一千一百八十三个乡完成了分配土地，一千零四个乡正在进行。现在，华东各地的土地改革运动，正以点面结合发动的方式，向全面展开。
    华东土地改革运动的进展是顺利和迅速的，广大农民热情极高，土地改革运动在年前将以更大的声势遍及华东新区。各地在有准备而又在试办中取得了经验之后，正强调有领导地大胆放手发动农民群众，从而开展千百万农民群众反封建的斗争，完成土地改革。
    中南
    【新华社汉口电】中南区各省的土地改革运动，已先后按实施计划逐步展开。根据工作基础和土地改革准备的情况，湘、鄂、赣等省已呈经中南军政委员会批准，将今冬明春实行土地改革的地区予以适当扩大。全中南区即将实行土地改革的地区，已由原定的一百六十一县约五千万农业人口的地区，扩大为一百八十多县、六千万人口的地区。湖北省实行土地改革的地区，原为二十三县，人口约七百万，现扩大到四十一万，人口为一千四百二十万。江西省原为四十四县，人口约七百万，现扩大到五十一县（其中十四县仅在部分地区实行土地改革），人口为九百七十万。湖南省原为三十一县人口约一千七百万，现扩大到三十五县，人口一千九百多万。河南仅有四十三县未完成土地改革，故仍为四十三县。广西、广东两省，则因股匪尚未最后肃清，土地改革的条件还不成熟，未予扩大。广西省实行土地改革的为桂林、南宁等专区的十余县，广东省仍为梅县、兴宁、揭阳三县。
    中南区各省广大农村自解放至今，一年来大抵都经过剿匪、反恶霸、减租等斗争，农民协会已自上而下建立起来。上述实行土地改革的地区，有组织的农民，平均可以占农村总人口的百分之二十到百分之三十。特别是经过夏秋间的整顿后，农民组织已是更加团结和巩固，会员成份也比以前纯洁了。九月间，中南区军政委员会通过上述地区实行土地改革的计划后，湖北、江西、湖南、河南各省人民政府和中共领导机关，在已有的工作基础上，开始了具体准备工作。各省均以土地改革的实施步骤、计划为主要议题，先后举行了省各界人民代表会议。各地中国共产党的组织，也都召开过党员代表会议，学习有关土地改革政策，并以批评与自我批评方式，进行总结工作，以端正政策，改进工作作风。经过各方面的准备，现各省、各专区、各县的土地改革的领导机关——土地改革委员会已相继建立。全区十万参加土地改革干部，也已大体上训练完毕。此外，各地均已选择重点乡进行了土地改革的试验。经过训练的新干部和富有工作经验的老干部，在典型试办中，边作边学，收获很大。这对推动大规模的土地改革运动，将有巨大的意义。
    目前中南区各地土地改革运动，已在重点试验的基础上，由点逐渐向面展开。上述实行土地改革的地区，将于今冬明春有计划地分期完成。河南省打算第一期先完成二十九县。湖南省除已完成五十四个乡外，年底前可结束第一阶段的五百个乡的土地改革。江西省首批一百八十四乡的实验工作结束后，运动正大规模展开。预计各地的土地改革运动于明年春耕前基本上可以全部完成。
