    In Patriotic Competition, Workers Diligently Study Technology
    Tangshan Power Plant Sets New National Coal Consumption Record
    [By Our Correspondent] Tangshan Power Plant, which has the lowest coal consumption standard in the national electricity industry, has once again set a new national coal consumption record in the patriotic production competition. The average standard coal consumption in November was 0.561, approaching the Soviet Union's average standard coal consumption record of 0.56.
    Before liberation, the standard coal consumption of Tangshan Power Plant was always above 0.711. After liberation at the end of 1948, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, government, and labor union, and the unity of the workers in promoting the enthusiasm of the working class, the workers carefully operated, used their brains, and came up with many methods, such as increasing the water content in coal from about 7% to about 10%; reducing excess air and rationally adjusting the air doors in various places; close cooperation between machines, electricity, and furnaces; and listening to the technical guidance of Soviet experts on the rational use of air separators, increasing feed water temperature, and reducing the overcooling of condensate, etc. Coal consumption has been reduced repeatedly. By December 1949, the average had reached 0.595. In January 1950, it was further reduced to 0.585. In mid-February 1950, the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national electricity conference and set a new coal consumption quota of 0.58 for Tangshan Plant. With the efforts of all employees, the average in February was 0.578, breaking the quota for the first time. Later, in May and June, it was further reduced to 0.577. The reason for the new achievement in November, in addition to the objective factor that the cooling circulating water in winter reduces steam turbine steam consumption, is mainly that leading cadres rely on the workers and masses and launched a patriotic production competition movement with enthusiasm for loving Chairman Mao, loving the country, and loving the factory. All employees are extremely concerned about coal consumption. At the same time, everyone saw that the coal consumption of power plants across the country generally decreased in the competition, especially the coal consumption of Qingdao Power Plant was not far from that of Tangshan Plant, which further stimulated the advancement of all employees. Under the leadership of labor hero Li Xiujun, all employees strengthened unity and continued to study and improve technology, such as: (1) Strengthening the analysis of carbon dioxide in flue gas. From 8:00 am to 10:00 pm every day, the testers perform a percentage analysis of carbon dioxide for each furnace every three hours and make a curve the next day for the operators' reference. The carbon dioxide of No. 2 furnace was always below 10% in the past. Under the efforts of the employees, it was finally increased to above 10%. For example, the old foreman Zhou Enrong discovered that the ash discharge door of No. 2 furnace was leaking air and immediately repaired it. When the old foreman Han Guidang saw that the pressure gauge of the induced draft fan of No. 2 furnace was the same as that of No. 1 furnace, but the motor speed was greater than that of No. 1 furnace, he adjusted the ventilation according to the current of the motors of the two furnace induced draft fans, avoiding the excessive ventilation of No. 2 furnace, which played a big role in increasing the percentage of carbon dioxide in No. 2 furnace. (2) Increase the number of fire checks to prevent the furnace bed from running out of red fire and the percentage of carbon dioxide from fluctuating, maintaining stability. (3) Improve the shift handover method. In the past, each shift often committed departmentalism, and often thinned the coal layer or increased ventilation before the shift handover; later, it was overcorrected, stipulating that regardless of the load, a 5-inch coal layer must be handed over. In the patriotic competition, everyone improved their overall concept. When each shift handed over, it was the same as normal operation, without changing the coal layer and ventilation. As a result, the percentage of carbon dioxide in each furnace also remained stable during the shift handover.

    唐山发电厂再创全国煤耗新纪录
    【本报讯】在全国电业中煤耗标准最低的唐山发电厂，在爱国主义生产竞赛中，再次创出全国煤耗新纪录，十一月份平均标准煤耗为零点五六一，并已接近苏联平均标准煤耗零点五六的纪录。
    唐山发电厂于解放前标准煤耗总在零点七一一以上，一九四八年底解放后，由于党政工的正确领导，团结职工发扬工人阶级的积极性，职工们精心运转，开动脑筋，想出许多办法，如煤中加水由百分之七左右增至百分之十左右；减少过剩空气，合理调整各处风门；机、电、炉紧密配合，以及听取苏联专家的技术指导合理使用空气分离器，增高给水温度及减低凝结水的过冷却等等，煤耗一再降低。至一九四九年十二月份平均已为零点五九五。至一九五零年一月份再度降低为零点五八五。一九五零年二月中旬，中央燃料工业部召开全电会议时，又给唐厂零点五八的新煤耗定额。在全体职工的努力下，二月份平均为零点五七八，首先打破定额。以后，五、六月份又进一步降低为零点五七七。至十一月份所以再次获得新的成绩，除客观上因冬季循环水凉，汽机汽耗减少外，主要还是领导干部依靠工人群众，以爱毛主席、爱国家、爱工厂而热烈展开了爱国主义生产竞赛运动。全体职工极为关心煤耗问题，同时，大家见到全国各电厂在竞赛中煤耗都普遍下降，尤其青岛电厂煤耗已与唐厂煤耗相差不远，这更刺激了全厂职工的前进心。全厂职工在劳动英雄李秀俊的带动下，加强团结，不断钻研改进技术。如：（一）加强烟道瓦斯的二氧化炭的分析。每天由早八点至晚十点，化验人员每隔三小时每炉即作一次二氧化炭分析的百分数，并于次日作出曲线，供运转人员参考，二号炉二氧化炭过去总在百分之十以下，在职工们努力之下，终于增高至百分之十以上。如老领班周恩荣曾发现二号炉放细灰门漏风，立即加以修理。老领班韩贵当看到二号炉吸风机风压表指示虽与一号炉相同，但电动机速度却大于一号炉，于是他就按着两个炉吸风机电动机的电流来调节通风，避免了二号炉的过大通风，对提高二号炉的二氧化炭的百分比有很大作用。（二）增加看火次数使炉床不跑掉红火，二氧化炭百分比不忽高忽低，保持平稳。（三）改善交班办法。过去各班常犯本位主义，每在交班前即改薄煤层，或加大通风；后来又矫枉过正，规定交班无论负荷大小，须交五英寸煤层。在爱国主义竞赛中，大家提高了整体观念，各班交班时与正常运转一样，不变化煤层及通风，结果交班时各炉的二氧化炭百分比亦保持平稳。
