    Curbing Profiteering Merchants to Stabilize Prices
    ——An Overview of Prices and Finance in November
    Yang Fangxun
    The price and financial situation in November, due to the nationwide patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, promoting a high degree of patriotism among the people, and the successive signing of patriotic pacts by the industrial and commercial sectors in major cities to ensure no hoarding and no speculation in order to stabilize the market, presented an increasingly stable situation. This is reflected in the following aspects:
    1. Stable Prices. According to the price index of 31 major commodities in six major cities compiled by the Ministry of Trade, the end of November saw only a slight increase of 0.5% compared to the end of October. The increase and decrease in prices of various commodities varied, with food grains decreasing by 5%, cotton cloth increasing by 2.7%, non-staple foods remaining stable, industrial materials increasing by 4.7%, general merchandise increasing by 0.9%, and fuel increasing by 12%.
    2. Reduced Transactions. The market experienced tighter credit and reduced commodity transaction volumes. For example, Tianjin's flour transactions on October 30th were 11,967 bags, while on November 30th they were 9,245 bags, a decrease of 23%. Shanghai's rice transactions on October 30th were 5.02 million catties, while on November 30th they were 3.37 million catties, a decrease of 33%.
    3. Continued Increase in State Bank Deposits. According to statistics from cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Beijing, the balance of deposits in the People's Bank at the end of November increased by 2.7% compared to the end of October.
    4. Gold and Silver Prices Decline. In October, due to the disruption by speculative merchants, gold and silver prices once rose. Recently, with the stabilization of prices and the victories on the Korean battlefield, prices have gradually declined. For example, Shanghai's gold price at the beginning of November decreased by 3% compared to the end of November.
    5. Stock Prices Rise. Recently, stock prices in Beijing and Tianjin have been rising again. For example, the stock of Qixin Cement Company in Tianjin was 6.2 million yuan per 100 shares on November 4th, and had risen to 6.8 million yuan by November 30th, an increase of 10%.
    In October, a small number of profiteering merchants attempted to exploit the opportunity of American imperialism expanding its aggression and the nationwide enthusiastic participation in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, to raise prices and seek exorbitant profits, thus hoarding large quantities of the people's main necessities such as cotton cloth and grain. This once caused fluctuations in certain commodities. Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country once again stopped the speculative activities of profiteering merchants, allowing the financial and price situation to continue to remain stable. This was achieved through the following efforts:
    (A) Strengthening cash management and tightening market funds.
    In addition to strengthening the cash management of various institutions, the state banks also focused on urging repayment in transactions with private banks and businesses, and in extending loans to industry and commerce, tightening currency circulation, which played a significant role in stabilizing finance and prices.
    (B) State-owned trading companies sell large quantities of materials to ensure the normal needs of producers and consumers, preventing profiteering merchants from manipulating the market.
    Recently, the quantity of cotton cloth sold by trading companies in Tianjin and other places still accounts for more than 80% of the total market turnover, which shows the abundance of material resources in state trading institutions.
    In early November, the price of pork in Shanghai once rose, increasing by 10% in the first five days of the month. This was entirely caused by profiteering merchants deliberately pushing up prices. Furthermore, some meat merchants, seeing that Huai pork had not arrived, took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that there were problems with transportation, causing the market price to begin to stir. The Native Produce Company criticized this but it was not corrected. On the 9th, the Native Produce Company added a business location and supplied large quantities, causing the price of meat to fall, dropping to 6,800 yuan, maintaining the stability of the meat price.
    (C) Strengthening market management and strictly banning commercial speculation.
    In order to implement Article 37 of the Common Program, protect all legal public and private trade, strictly ban speculative commerce that disrupts the market, and achieve the purpose of stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government issued "Several Instructions on Banning Commercial Speculation" on November 14th. Based on the spirit of these instructions, various localities formulated market management methods and conducted inspections of profiteering merchants who did not comply with the law, handling them according to the principle of education and transformation as the main approach and punishment as a supplementary measure, based on the severity of their circumstances.
    On October 30th, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce announced the cotton cloth market management rules, which stipulated that cotton yarn merchants purchasing more than one piece of cotton yarn must be approved by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and that private cotton yarn stocks should be applied for sale before November 15th, otherwise they would be treated as hoarded cotton yarn. Several merchants who did not comply with these regulations were punished. Tianjin has taken appropriate measures against a small number of coal merchants who hoarded goods for speculation. Shanghai, Beijing, and other places have captured several speculators who resold gold, silver, and US dollars, and severely punished them. These correct measures have had a very effective effect in stabilizing finance and prices.

    制止奸商投机稳定物价            
    ——十一月份物价金融概述
    杨方勋
    十一月份的物价和金融情况，由于全国人民在抗美援朝保家卫国的正义运动下，发扬了高度的爱国主义精神，以及各大城市的工商业界又先后签订爱国公约，保证不囤积、不投机，以稳定市场，因而呈现了日益平稳的局面。这表现在以下的几个方面：
    一、物价平稳。根据贸易部编制的六大城市三十一种主要商品物价指数来看，十一月底与十月底比较，仅微升百分之零点五。各种商品升降的幅度不一，其中粮食类下降百分之五，花纱布上升百分之二点七，副食品平稳，工业器材上升百分之四点七，百货上升百分之零点九，燃料上升百分之十二。
    二、成交减少。市场银根较紧，商品成交量减少。如天津十月三十日成交面粉一一、九六七袋，十一月三十日成交九、二四五袋，减少百分之二十三，上海十月三十日成交大米五○二万斤，十一月三十日成交三三七万斤，减少百分之三十三。
    三、国家银行存款继续增加。根据上海、天津、汉口、广州、重庆、西安、北京等城市的统计，人民银行存款余额十一月底与十月底比较，增加百分之二点七。
    四、金银价格下落。十月份由于投机商人扰乱，金价银格曾一度上涨，最近随着物价的稳定，朝鲜战场的胜利，价格也逐步下落了。如上海金价十一月初与十一月底比较，已下落百分之三。
    五、股票价格上升。近来北京、天津股票价格又在上升。如天津启新洋灰公司股票，十一月四日每百股六十二万元，三十日已升达六十八万元，上升百分之十。
    十月份曾有少数奸商企图利用美帝国主义扩大侵略，全国人民热烈地进行抗美援朝的时机，抬高物价、谋取暴利，于是大量囤购人民的主要生活必需品纱布、粮食等。曾一度引起某些商品的波动。全国人民在中央人民政府的正确领导下，又一次制止了奸商的投机活动，使金融物价继续保持平稳状态，这是由下列几方面努力获得的：
    （甲）加强现金管理，紧缩市场筹码。
    国家银行除加强各机关等的现金管理外，并在与私人行庄往来和对工商业放款进行有重点地催收，紧缩了通货，对稳定金融物价起了很大作用。
    （乙）国营贸易公司，大量出售物资，保证生产者与消费者的正常需要，使奸商不能操纵市场。
    最近天津等地贸易公司出售的纱布数量，仍占市场总成交量百分之八十以上，这就可以看出国家贸易机构物资力量的充裕。
    上海十一月初猪肉价格一度上涨，即在月初的五天内上涨了百分之十，这完全是奸商故意哄抬造成的。且部分肉商见淮猪没有到货，乘机散布谣言，说运输有问题，使市价开始蠢动。经土产公司提出批评亦未改正。九日土产公司便增设营业所一处，大量供应，肉价因而下降，即降至六千八百元，保持了肉价的稳定。
    （丙）加强市场管理，严厉取缔商业投机。
    中央人民政府贸易部为了贯彻共同纲领第三十七条的规定，保护一切合法的公私贸易。严格取缔扰乱市场的投机商业，达到稳定物价，安定民生的目的起见，于十一月十四日发布“关于取缔商业投机的几项指示”，各地根据这一指示精神，制定管理市场办法，并对不遵守法令的奸商，进行检查，根据其情节轻重，本教育改造为主，处罚为辅的方针，予以处理。
    上海市工商局十月三十日公布了纱布市场管理规则，其中规定棉纱商购买棉纱在一件以上者，须经工商局核准，私人存纱应于十一月十五日以前申请出售，逾期作囤纱论处。并处分了不遵守这一规定的数家商号。天津曾对少数居奇的囤积煤商，作了适当处理。上海、北京等地曾捕获数起倒卖金银美钞的投机分子，并予以严厉制裁。这些正确的措施对稳定金融物价发生了很有效的作用。
