    Denouncing Austin's Insult to the Chinese People
        I
            President of Fu Jen Catholic University, Chen Yuan
    We express our extreme indignation at the absurd remarks made by Austin, the representative of the American warmongers, in the Security Council. He insulted the Chinese people and described all the crimes of aggression against China as "Sino-American friendship." He truly turned right and wrong on its head, reaching the extreme of deception.
    I study religious history, and I recognize that imperialism uses religion to carry out aggression in China. Their spending money to run schools in China is purposeful. They want to cultivate tools to serve them and to enslave the Chinese people. The Chinese people, who have already stood up, understand this very clearly.
    All the teachers, students, and staff of our Fu Jen Catholic University expelled the forces of imperialism two months ago. From our experience in the anti-imperialist struggle at Fu Jen Catholic University, we recognize that the Chinese people can only achieve victory and liberation by waging a resolute struggle against the enemy who is aggressing against us—the American imperialists. Today, various religious groups, schools, and hospitals have united to protest Austin's insult to the Chinese people and to hold demonstrations. This is the just struggle of the Chinese people. Let us all unite and fight to the end to overthrow imperialism.
            II
            Dean of the Religious College of Yenching University, Zhao Zichen
    American imperialism stops at nothing, and the means it uses are to distort facts, sow discord, and slander. Austin's speech in the Security Council completely exposed this method. When the American army was helpless in Korea and unable to account to the American people, Austin exaggerated and slandered us in order to deceive his own people. We who work in the church cannot contain our anger, so we want to have a demonstration in addition to issuing a declaration. We are patriotic, wholeheartedly support the government, and sincerely believe in Christ. From now on, we must be more vigilant and step up our efforts for self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation, to give a strong and practical witness to the truth and righteousness we believe in.
            III
            President of Peking Union Medical College, Li Zong'en
    Austin's lengthy speech in the Security Council on November 28th is nothing more than the old tune of American imperialism trying to quibble and shirk responsibility in order to cover up its ferocious aggressive face. American imperialism used 6 billion US dollars worth of huge amounts of funds and materials to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, slaughtering the Chinese people, bankrupting vast rural areas in China, causing large numbers of factories to close down, and causing millions of people to die from freezing and starvation. All of this is an ironclad fact and cannot be denied. However, in order to cover up the truth, American imperialism brazenly said that it had established many schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations in China. However, the people's eyes are sharp. Regardless of the motives of these donors, we will never allow American imperialism to use this as an excuse to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong. We must expose the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism and give it a relentless blow.
            IV
            Pastor of the North China Congregational Church of Christ, Wei Zhenyu
    Because Austin, the representative of American imperialism in the Security Council, made remarks insulting the Chinese people, he aroused the anger of various Christian workers in Beijing. On the evening of the 11th, Yenching University initiated a meeting of representatives of various Christian organizations at the Dengshikou Church, and unanimously decided to hold a collective demonstration on the 13th to show resistance. In addition to issuing a declaration refuting Austin's shameless lies, the Christian organizations in Beijing held a demonstration to support our country's representative to the Security Council, Wu Xiuquan, in his testimony against American imperialism.
            V
            Bishop of the Chinese Anglican Church, Ling Xianyang
    I believe that the shameless lies spoken by Austin, the lackey of Wall Street, in the Security Council are a great insult to our people, especially to our Chinese churches, schools, and hospitals. Based on the history of American imperialism's aggression against China, we can recognize that American imperialism spared no expense in China to open up its cultural concessions and peddle cultural opium to anesthetize the knowledge of the backward Chinese people. American imperialism used the slogan of "maintaining the territorial and administrative integrity of China" to obtain "extraterritoriality" and "equal opportunity," and further obtained the status of "most-favored nation" to enjoy "special interests." Since World War II, American imperialism, as one of the victorious countries, has wanted to dominate the world, control the internal affairs of various countries, and control the world economy, not hesitating to create future wars and slaughter the human race. These ironclad facts are obvious to everyone. Austin avoided mentioning them and instead called "aggression" "friendship," using the small favors given by the American people to cover up its aggression. Today, I recognize that the Chinese people have stood up and can no longer be deceived by him. The Chinese churches, schools, and hospitals are all standing on the side of our Chinese people, and we will give American imperialism a severe blow, expose its conspiracy, and smash all of American imperialism's aggressive plans. Our Chinese church only knows how to be loyal to Christ and loyal to our motherland, and we will never tolerate American imperialism using Christianity as a tool for its aggression.
            VI
            Pastor of the Church of Christ in China, Shao Fengyuan
    Austin's speech in the Security Council on November 28th truly exposed his shamelessness. In his lengthy speech, he cited the educational and medical undertakings of Chinese Christianity, all of which he regarded as gifts from the American imperialist government and exaggerated as their "benevolence," while slandering the genuine friendship of the Chinese and American people and the genuine Christians who serve the people without charge.
    We Chinese Christians and colleagues in church work are loyal to Christ and love our motherland. We deny Austin's extremely quibbling remarks. If it were not for the love of Christ motivating us to serve the church, no amount of material money would make a true Chinese Christian your argument. This kind of distorted aggression speech, not only the Chinese Christian church denies this malicious insult, but also the Christians in the American people will protest.
            VII
            Staff of the Beijing YMCA
    The American imperialist's war of aggression in Korea suffered a tragic defeat by the heroic counterattack of the Korean and Chinese people. At the same time, our representative Wu Xiuquan used the platform of the United Nations Security Council to expose the ferocious face of American imperialist aggression in front of the people of the world, accusing American imperialism of its crimes, which made the people of the world excited and cheering, and made American imperialism tremble and curse.
    So Austin Dulles and these warmongers brought out the Chinese church cause, slandering the good Chinese Christians who live on the "grace" of imperialist alms. Every righteous and patriotic Christian cannot but express great anger at Austin's shameless lies. Our protest demonstration is a loud answer to Austin's shameless slander.
    We want to tell the people of the whole country and the world that Chinese Christians love the motherland, hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism. We resolutely support the great patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homeland, and we are participating in this struggle against American imperialist aggression with various concrete work.
    We call on members and colleagues of the YMCA throughout the country to unite and refute Austin's shameless lies with concrete actions, first strive to achieve self-reliance and self-support, and actively participate in the national movement to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homeland. The final victory must belong to the people of the world.

    斥奥斯汀侮辱中国人民
        一
            辅仁大学校长  陈垣
    我们对于美国战争贩子代表奥斯汀在安理会发表的荒谬言论，表示十分愤恨，他侮辱中国人民，他把一切侵略中国的罪行，说成“中美友谊”，真是颠倒是非，极尽欺骗之能事。
    我是研究宗教史的，我认识帝国主义利用宗教在中国进行侵略工作，他花钱在中国办学校，是有企图的，是想培养为他们服务的工具，想奴化中国人民。这在已经站起来了的中国人民，是认识的很清楚。
    我们辅仁大学，全体师生员工把帝国主义的势力驱逐出去，到今天已经两个月了。从我们辅仁大学的反帝斗争经验中，我们认识中国人民只有向侵略我们的敌人——美帝国主义者，进行坚决的斗争，我们才能获得胜利，求得解放。今天各教会团体、学校、医院都联合起来，抗议奥斯汀对中国人民的侮辱，举行游行示威。这是中国人民的正义斗争，让我们大家团结起来，为打倒帝国主义而奋斗到底。
            二
            燕京大学宗教学院院长  赵紫宸
    美帝国主义无所不用其极，其所用手段是歪曲事实，离间污蔑。奥斯汀在安理会上的演说里完全把这种方法暴露出来。奥斯汀在美军在朝鲜无可奈何的时候，无法对美国人民交账，就大吹大擂地污蔑我们，以哄骗他自己的国人。我们作教会工作的人不胜愤怒，所以要在发表宣言之余，来一个示威大游行。我们是爱国的，是全心拥护政府的，也是真心信奉基督的。从今以后我们更要警惕更要加紧自立自养自传，为我们所信仰的真理与正谊作一个有力的切实的见证。
            三
            北京协和医学院院长  李宗恩
    奥斯汀于十一月二十八日在安理会上所发表的冗长演说，不过是美帝为了遮盖其狰狞侵略面目而妄图狡辩，推卸责任的老调重弹而已。美帝曾经用了六十万万美元的巨款和物资帮助蒋介石打内战，屠杀中国的人民，使中国广大的农村破产，大批的工厂倒闭，千千万万的人民因冻饿而死亡。这一切，都是铁一般的事实，决不容抵赖的。但是，美帝为了掩饰真相，却大言不惭地说，在中国办了多少学校、医院和慈善机关，不过人民的眼睛是雪亮的，我们姑不论这些捐款人的动机是什么，但决不容美帝以此为借口而颠倒黑白，混淆是非。我们要揭发美帝的侵略阴谋而予以无情的打击。
            四
            华北中华基督教公理会牧师  魏振玉
    因为美帝驻安理会代表奥斯汀发表侮辱中国人民之言论而激起京市基督教各项工作人员之愤怒，十一日晚假灯市口教会，由燕京大学发起召开基督教各团体代表会议，一致通过于十三日举行集体示威游行大会，以示反抗。京市基督教各团体除发表宣言，驳斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言外，并举行游行示威，借以支援我国出席安理会伍修权代表回击美帝国主义的见证。
            五
            中华圣公会主教  凌贤扬
    华尔街走卒奥斯汀在安理会上所发的无耻谰言，我认为，他对于我国人民，尤其是对于我中国教会、学校及医院是莫大的侮辱。根据美帝侵华历史，我们可以认清美帝在中国，为开辟他的文化租界，推销文化鸦片，麻醉中国知识落后的人民，不惜出了相当的血本。美帝用“保持中国的领土与行政的完整的口号”，而取得了“治外法权”与“利益均沾”，又进一步取得了“最惠国”的地位，而享受“特殊利益”。自二次世界大战后，美帝以战胜国之一竟要称雄世界，左右各国的内政，掌握世界经济，不惜制造未来的大战，屠杀世界人类。这种铁的事实，彰彰在人耳目，奥斯汀避而不言，反说“侵略”为“友谊”，利用美国人民给的一点小惠，掩盖它侵略的事实，今日我认清楚了，中国人民站起来了，不能再受他的瞒哄欺骗了。中国的教会、学校和医院，都是站在我们中国人民的立场上，要给美帝一个严重的打击，揭露美帝的阴谋，粉碎美帝一切侵略的计划。我们中国教会只知道忠于基督，忠于祖国，决不容忍美帝利用基督教做它侵略的工具。
            六
            中华基督教会牧师  邵凤元
    奥斯汀在十一月二十八日安理会上的演说确实暴露了他的无耻，长篇大论的举出了中国基督教的教育与医药等事业，这些他都认为是美帝政府的赐与并夸大是他们的“恩惠”，而诽谤多少真正中美人民的友谊及为人民服务不收代价的真基督教徒。
    我们中国基督教徒及教会事业的同人是忠于基督的，也是热爱我们祖国的。我们否认奥斯汀这穷极狡辩的言论，若不是基督的爱激励我们为教会服务，你再多的物资金圆也不会使一个中国真的基督徒作为你的辩词。这种曲解侵略的演说，不单中国基督教会否认这恶意的侮辱，就是美国人民中的基督徒也会抗议的。
            七
            北京基督教青年会工作人员
    美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略战争，受到朝中两国人民的英勇反击而悲惨地失败了。同时我国代表伍修权用联合国安理会的讲坛，在全世界人民面前揭露美帝侵略的狰狞面目，控诉美帝的罪行，使全世界人民兴奋欢呼，使美帝颤抖咒骂。
    于是奥斯汀杜勒斯这些战争贩子就搬出中国的教会事业，诬蔑善良的中国基督徒是靠帝国主义的“恩惠”施舍而生活的。每一个正义、爱国的基督徒，对奥斯汀的无耻谰言都不能不表示极大的愤怒。我们的抗议示威游行，便是对奥斯汀无耻诬蔑的响亮回答。
    我们要告诉全国和全世界人民，中国基督徒是热爱祖国的，是仇视、鄙视、蔑视美国帝国主义的。我们坚决拥护抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动，并且正在用各种具体的工作参加这个反对美帝侵略的斗争。
    我们号召全国各地基督教青年会的会员与同工，一致起来，以具体行动驳斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言，首先努力达到自立自养，并积极参加全国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，最后胜利一定是全世界人民的。
