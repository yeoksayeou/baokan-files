    China National Grain Company, Northern Jiangsu Branch,
    Seriously Wastes Telegraph and Telephone Services
    To the Editor:
    Currently, some state-owned enterprise organs in Northern Jiangsu are experiencing serious waste when using telegrams and long-distance telephones. This situation may also exist in other regions and should be given prompt attention and corrected.
    Taking the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Company as an example: On one occasion, the Suining office under the branch sent a telegram of 146 characters, reporting the final payments for each commodity down to the last few liang. For example, "ten" liang of sorghum was written as "six two five." Ten liang of sorghum is worth only 400 yuan, but the three extra telegraph characters cost 5,400 yuan. This kind of wasted telegram is common in the branch. Sometimes, a lack of knowledge of telegram common sense also leads to a lot of waste, such as not writing the telegraphic codes of both parties but writing a long string of organization addresses and names, not writing the month and day codes but directly writing "a certain month and day of 1950," writing numbers as "500,000,000" instead of "five hundred million," etc. In terms of text waste, there are many redundant and superfluous words, or it is "concise" to the point of requiring repeated inquiries.
    In terms of long-distance telephone, the waste is also very serious. For example, a comrade from the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Company spoke with Huaiyin eighteen times (each time for three minutes, costing 18,600 yuan), when actually seven or eight times would have been enough. He added several "hello, hello, hello" to every sentence, and repeated every sentence, which worried his colleagues. The main problem with wasting long-distance calls is the lack of preparation beforehand; people speak as they think of things, even engaging in idle chatter. When discussing work, they also include routine greetings and exchange pleasantries; some conversations go on for seven or eight times without being finished. Others do not take notes during the call, and then forget and inquire again by telegram; for example, a certain company talked to the same company in the same location eight times in one day, which could actually have been combined into one call. In addition, regardless of the importance, urgency, and necessity, they make calls whenever they want, and send telegrams whenever they want, without ever calculating how much it will cost.
    This kind of waste, on a national scale, should not be a small problem. The Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Company spent a total of 278.8 million yuan on postal and telecommunications expenses in October. If we calculate that there are eight similar professional trade organizations in Northern Jiangsu, it would cost 2.23 billion yuan per month, and 26.769 billion yuan per year. If we then calculate that there are 30 administrative regions in the country like Northern Jiangsu, it would cost 803.088 billion yuan. If we calculate the waste at 5%, it would amount to over 40.15 billion yuan. This serious waste of state property should not and cannot be allowed to exist. We hope that state-owned enterprises and organs across the country will conduct timely inspections, correct mistakes if they exist, and strive to do better if they do not.

### 中国粮食公司苏北分公司  使用电报电话浪费严重

    中国粮食公司苏北分公司
    使用电报电话浪费严重编辑同志：
    目前苏北有些国营企业机关在使用电报和长途电话时，有严重的浪费现象。这种情形，在其他地区可能也存在着，应及时引起重视，并加以纠正。
    以中国粮食公司苏北分公司为例：有一次，该公司所属睢宁办事处打来一个达一百四十六字的电报，把每一项商品的尾款几两都照报了，如红粮“十”两却写成“六二五”。红粮十两本身才值四百元，多余的三个电报字就需五千四百元。类似这种浪费电报在分公司很多。有时，因不懂打电报常识也引起了不少的浪费，如不写双方电报挂号却写了一大串机关地址名称，不写月日代号却直书一九五○年某月某日，写数字不写“五亿”却写“５００，０００，０００”等。在文字上的浪费是噜噜苏苏的虚字多，或者是“简练”过份，以致来往不断的反复询问。
    在长途电话方面，浪费情形也很严重。如中国粮食公司苏北分公司某同志与淮阴通话一回就达十八次（一次为三分钟需一万八千六百元），实际只需七、八次就够了。他说一句话就要加上几个“喂喂喂”，每句话都要重复，旁边同志都替他着急。长途电话的浪费主要问题在于事先未作准备，临时想到那里就说那里，甚至海阔天空的漫谈。谈工作时，还要来一个家常问好，互通寒暄；有谈七八次还谈不完的。还有通话时不记录，以后忘了时再去电询问；如某公司一天与同一地点公司通话八回，实际是可以合并在一回谈的。此外不分轻重缓急和需要，要打电话就打，要发电报就发，从不计算要费多少钱。
    这种浪费现象在全国范围内说来，应该不是一个小问题。中国粮食公司苏北分公司在十月份共用去邮电费用是二亿七千八百余万元；如苏北类似这种专业贸易组织机构以八个单位计算，一月就需二十二亿三千余万元，一年就需二六七亿六千九百余万元；若再以全国三十个像苏北这样的行政区来计算，就需八○三○亿八千八百余万元。其中浪费即以百分之五计算，就合四○一亿五千余万元。这种严重浪费国家财产的现象是不应该、也不允许存在的。希望全国国营企业机关及时检查，有则改之，无则加勉。
