Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 18th: Over 1,200 medical workers in Nanjing are eagerly registering to organize the "Nanjing Volunteer Medical Team for Resisting America and Aiding Korea." Prominent figures and experts from Nanjing's medical and health circles who have already registered include: Cai Qiao, physiologist and Dean of the Medical School of Nanjing University; Jiang Sichang, ENT specialist and President of Nanjing University Hospital; Chen Zuyin, thoracic surgery expert and President of the private Gulou Hospital; Wang Weisan, Vice President of the East China Military Region Hospital (formerly Central Hospital); Xu Tongqing, President of the Municipal First Hospital; and Dong Jian, Vice President, among others. Wu Zaidong, Chairman of the Nanjing Medical Workers' Union and pathologist, and Guo Jiaqiang, Chairman of the Nanjing Student Federation, have also taken the lead in registering. The Nanjing Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression and the Nanjing Medical Workers' Union originally planned to organize a medical team of 160 people to serve on the front lines; however, after the call was issued, the number of applicants exceeded eight times the original plan, reaching more than one-third of all medical workers in the city, and all are vying to be in the first group to depart. Many of the applicants are returnees from the United States, and there are also many Christians. This fully demonstrates the breadth and consolidation of the anti-imperialist, patriotic united front; and also proves the bankruptcy of imperialist cultural aggression. Of the 36 people who registered from Gulou Hospital (run by the church), half are Christians, and the president, Chen Zuyin, returned from the United States last year and is also a Christian.

These medical workers who volunteered to join the medical team have received great respect and encouragement from society and their families. Nanjing newspapers have published the news of the medical team in prominent positions and paid tribute to the glorious white-clad warriors. Hospitals are doing their best to lend medical equipment to the medical team. Students from the Medical School of Nanjing University have initiated the organization of a blood transfusion team to support them; and the trade unions of various hospitals are actively organizing "Home Care Groups for Departing Family Members" to take care of household affairs for members going to Korea.

    宁市千二百余医务工作者
    报名组织抗美援朝医疗团
    【新华社南京十八日电】南京市医务工作者一千二百余人竞相报名组织“南京市抗美援朝志愿医疗团”。南京医药、卫生界的名流和专家已报名的有：生理学家南京大学医学院院长蔡翘，耳鼻喉科专家南京大学医院院长姜泗长，胸部外科专家私立鼓楼医院院长陈祖荫，华东军区医院（原中央医院）副院长王畏三，市立第一医院院长许同庆，副院长董健等。南京市医务工会主席病理学家吴在东，南京市学联主席郭加强也都带头报名。南京市医药卫生界保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会和南京市医务工会原拟组织一个一百六十人的医疗团前往战地服务；但是当号召发出后，报名者竟超过了八倍，达全市医务工作者三分之一以上，并都争着要求第一批出发。报名者中有不少是留美的，还有很多基督教徒。这充分证明了反帝爱国统一战线的广阔和巩固；也证明了帝国主义的文化侵略的破产。鼓楼医院（教会办）报名的三十六人中即有一半是基督教徒，院长陈祖荫系去年从美国回来的，也是基督教徒。
    这些志愿参加医疗团的医务工作者，受到了社会和家庭的极大尊敬和鼓励。南京各报纸都以重要篇幅登载医疗团的消息并向光荣的白衣战士们致敬。各医院都尽可能地将医疗器械借给医疗团。南京大学医学院学生已发起组织输血队支援他们；各医院的工会则积极组织“出征家属安家小组”，为赴朝会员照料家事。
