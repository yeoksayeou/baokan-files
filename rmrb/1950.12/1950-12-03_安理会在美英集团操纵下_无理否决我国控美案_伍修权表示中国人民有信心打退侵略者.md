Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: According to TASS, New York, December 2nd, the Security Council met on the afternoon of November 30th to continue discussing the case of accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, as well as the notorious case of "accusing aggression against the Republic of Korea."

The first speaker was British representative Jebb, who supported the French representative's suggestion the day before to vote on the six-nation proposal. In defending the Western countries' imperialist policies in Asia, Jebb repeated the slanders and fabrications of the US-British bloc leaders, insisting that the Korean incident was the result of North Koreans' "aggression." When it came to Taiwan, Jebb groundlessly denied US aggression against China. He claimed that the status of Taiwan "remains an internationally relevant issue." He attempted to link the resolution of the Taiwan issue with the Chinese Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean military action.

Security Council President Bebler then spoke in the capacity of the Yugoslav Tito group representative, supporting the six-nation proposal.

Next, Indian representative Rau stated that he had not yet received final instructions from his government regarding the six-nation proposal, so if a vote were to be held that day, he would not participate in the voting but would reserve the right to issue a statement afterward.

Soviet representative Malik then spoke, pointing out that Jebb and Austin had not been able to offer any rebuttal to the facts exposing US aggression against Taiwan, as cited by the Soviet representative in his statement.

Austin insisted yesterday that he had not had time to read the speech of Chinese representative Wu Xiuquan, and today Jebb also ignored the facts presented by Wu Xiuquan and Malik that clearly demonstrated US aggression against China. Malik pointed out that this is in line with US traditions; the United States is accustomed to casually dismissing facts that refute and expose the United States.

Malik then spoke about Jebb's speech, severely criticizing Jebb as a defender and active propagandist of imperialism. Malik pointed out that Jebb's statement about Britain having a military mission in Korea showed that there was no difference between the positions of the United States and Britain because they were both carrying out a war of aggression against the Korean people. Malik cited an article written by Randolph Churchill, published in the November 3rd issue of the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, to expose Jebb's hypocritical evasions; the article pointed out that Britain, on the one hand, recognizes the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand, maintains military contact with the Kuomintang in Taiwan. The article also admitted that Truman's order gave the Seventh Fleet the task of being hostile to the Chinese people because he instructed the fleet to fight against any army advancing from the mainland towards Taiwan. When referring to the intentions of the United States, Randolph Churchill wrote: "In Taiwan, no one believes that the United States is preparing to abandon Taiwan in any conceivable future." Malik said that this frank statement shows that the United States has seized Taiwan and has no intention of giving it up. Its exposure of Britain's true position proves that Jebb's so-called "disinterested" position of Britain is absurd and also proves why Jebb cannot adopt a fair attitude towards the US aggression against Taiwan issue.

Malik criticized the United States and Britain for deliberately not mentioning a word about the accusation of US aggression against Taiwan. He pointed out that the Tito representative was trying to confuse the issue in order to actively support the US aggressors. Malik said that the Soviet delegation believes that the Taiwan issue is the primary issue on the Security Council's agenda. The Security Council must carefully study the issue of aggression against Taiwan and make a fair decision on this issue. Not only does the representative of the People's Republic of China, who is attending the Security Council, demand a fair decision, but also 475 million Chinese people demand a fair decision. The Chinese people are waiting for a fair decision from the Security Council. Malik said that the US ruling group must immediately stop its aggression against Taiwan and withdraw its troops from Taiwan.

General Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the People's Republic of China, then spoke. He severely criticized US representative Austin's speech at the previous meeting for evading the accusation of US aggression against Taiwan, but attempting to slander and intimidate the Chinese people. After once again exposing the US aggression, he solemnly stated that the Chinese people have full confidence in repelling all imperialist aggressors who dare to invade China, and demanded that the Security Council accept the proposals of the People's Republic of China. (See separate telegram for the full text of the speech.) After Wu Xiuquan spoke, the Security Council immediately voted first on the Soviet proposal of September 2, which demanded condemning US aggression against Taiwan and demanding the rapid withdrawal of US troops from Taiwan and other Chinese territories. The Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal with one vote in favor and nine votes against; India did not participate in the voting.

The Security Council then rejected with the same number of votes the proposals put forward by the People's Republic of China, which were formally proposed by the Soviet delegation. It demanded: "1. The United Nations Security Council openly condemns and takes concrete steps to severely punish the US government's crimes of armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan and armed interference in Korea; 2. The United Nations Security Council immediately takes effective measures to ensure that the United States completely withdraws its armed aggressive forces from Taiwan in order to guarantee peace and security in the Pacific and Asia; 3. The United Nations Security Council immediately takes effective measures to ensure that the United States and other foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea, and that the internal affairs of Korea are resolved by the people of North and South Korea themselves, in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue."

The Security Council then voted on the six-nation proposal. At the request of the President of the Security Council, the preamble and the operative part of this proposal were voted on separately. The voting results: The preamble of the proposal, which mentioned the Security Council's resolution of June 25, the General Assembly's resolution of October 7, and MacArthur's "special report" of November 5, received eight votes in favor, one vote against from the Soviet Union, and one abstention; India did not participate in the voting and was rejected because one permanent member voted against it. The operative part of the proposal received nine votes in favor, the Soviet Union voted against it, and India did not participate in the voting, and it was also rejected because one permanent member voted against it. Then the chairman requested a vote on the entire proposal. Malik objected, saying that doing so was unnecessary because the various parts had already been rejected. However, the chairman insisted on voting on the entire proposal, so the proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union's negative vote, with the other nine voting in favor and India not participating in the voting. The meeting then adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: New York News: The Security Council met on November 29th to continue discussing the Soviet accusation against the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, as well as the so-called "aggression against the Republic of Korea" case that was unreasonably forced onto the agenda by the US delegation and the Security Council President, the Tito group representative Bebler, who was currying favor with the United States.

At the request of Soviet representative Malik, the meeting first read the telegram from Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on November 26, which protested against the US military's bloody atrocities in Korea and demanded that the United Nations take measures to stop such atrocities.

Next, the representative of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, Lim Byung-jik, spoke, obsequiously covering up for the US aggressors and shamelessly echoing the United States, wantonly insulting the Chinese people.

The so-called representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, Jiang Tingfu, then spoke on the Taiwan issue. At this point, Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the People's Republic of China, immediately took his seat at the conference table. Prior to this, Representative Wu Xiuquan had refused to sit at the conference table and sat in the VIP seats because the representative of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime was speaking on a proposal that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China did not agree to participate in the discussion of.

In his speech in English, Jiang Tingfu shamelessly defended his American masters. He insisted that Chinese primary school textbooks proved that the United States has never been imperialistic and has never invaded China.

After Jiang Tingfu's speech, Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the People's Republic of China, made the following statement: "Mr. Chairman, distinguished representatives: In my speech yesterday, I stated that the representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group has no right to represent China at all, and therefore there is absolutely no need to respond to his speech. The so-called representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group in the United Nations and its affiliated organizations have nothing else to do except to be mouthpieces for the US imperialists. I once again remind all representatives that the representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, who has been spurned by the Chinese people, has no right to represent China at all. I doubt whether the person speaking is Chinese, because he cannot even speak the language of the great 475 million Chinese people. In the discussion of the People's Republic of China's accusation against the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, this representative declares the right to continue to speak."

The next speaker was French representative Chauvel, who recounted that on November 10, France and the United States, Britain, Ecuador, Cuba, and Norway jointly put forward a proposal to "assure" the Chinese government of the border between China and Korea, while requesting the "Chinese army" to withdraw from Korea (according to Chauvel, "Chinese troops" had been found to have appeared). Chauvel requested that the Security Council continue to discuss the six-nation proposal.

US representative Austin then spoke. He said many rude words that greatly attacked the Chinese people. Austin then prevaricated, saying that the US actions in Korea could not be regarded as aggression. He said that the US troops' entry into Korea was caused by the Korean situation, and he suggested that a debate should begin on the six-nation proposal.

Soviet representative Malik then spoke, severely criticizing the United States for carrying out aggression in Korea, but forcibly stealing the name of the "United Nations," and repeatedly rejecting Soviet proposals, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean War in the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Malik pointed out that the whole world knows that the army that plays a decisive role in Korea is the US army. Even British Prime Minister Attlee, when answering Churchill's questions in the House of Commons, admitted that the Korean War was conducted by the United States. After the United States invaded Korea, it clearly and illegally violated the 38th parallel and began to advance towards the Chinese border, and bombed Chinese territory, killing Chinese people and destroying Chinese property, thereby invading Chinese territory.

Malik then refuted Austin's absurd arguments for defending US occupation of Taiwan. He said that the US actions violated a well-known fundamental principle of international law—the principle of prohibiting interference in the territory of other countries. The motive for the United States to send warships to Taiwan was based on strategic considerations to prevent the Chinese People's Government from entering Taiwan. A universally known principle of international law is that a country that forcibly blockades the coast and ports of another country with its navy is the attacking party. Malik exposed the falsity of the US's legal argument that the Chinese government came to Taiwan after the war only because the Allied powers asked the Chinese government to accept Japan's surrender. Malik pointed out that the invitation to the Chinese government to accept surrender was based on the Cairo Agreement, which stipulated that Taiwan should be completely returned to China. Malik continued: The US statement "welcoming" the United Nations to consider the Taiwan issue is intended to confuse world public opinion about the issue. He said: The real meaning of the US statement is: The United States is trying to force this issue onto the United Nations in order to overturn the previous decision.

The United States is currently trying to bring the "Formosa issue" to the United Nations, vainly attempting to change the legal status of Taiwan and cover up US aggression.

Malik finally declared: China has asked the Security Council to take urgent measures to have the United States withdraw its troops from Korea and Taiwan. The Security Council's responsibility lies in safeguarding the victim of aggression—China, and immediately taking steps to deal with the aggressor—the United States. The Soviet delegation, after consulting with the Soviet government, has put forward a proposal to take action to stop US aggression against China. Unfortunately, this proposal has not yet been distributed to the members of the Security Council, but it is expected to be distributed on the morning of November 30. At the same time, the Soviet Union also supports the proposal put forward by Chinese representative Wu Xiuquan, so the Soviet delegation proposes that this proposal be put to a vote.

    安理会在美英集团操纵下
    无理否决我国控美案
    伍修权表示中国人民有信心打退侵略者
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：安全理事会在十一月三十日下午开会，继续讨论控诉美国武装侵略台湾案以及臭名昭彰的“控诉对大韩民国的侵略”案。
    第一个发言的是英代表杰伯，他支持法国代表在前一天所提表决六国提案的建议。杰伯在辩护西方国家在亚洲的帝国主义政策时重复了美英集团头目们的诽谤捏造，硬说朝鲜事件的发动是由于北朝鲜人“侵略”的结果。杰伯在说到台湾时，毫无理由地否认美国对中国的侵略。他声称：台湾的地位“仍是一个国际有关的问题”。他企图把台湾问题的解决与中国志愿部队参加朝鲜的军事行动一事联系起来。
    安全理事会主席贝勃勒接着以南斯拉夫铁托集团代表的身份发言，支持六国提案。
    接着发言的印度代表劳氏在他尚未自政府接获关于六国提案的最后训令，所以如果当天要举行表决，他将不参加投票，但将保留事后发表声明的权利。
    苏联代表马立克继起发言，他指出：杰伯和奥斯汀对苏联代表在声明中所举出的揭露美国侵略台湾的事实，都不能提出任何的反驳。
    奥斯汀在昨天硬说他还没有时间来阅读中国代表伍修权的演讲，而今天杰伯也不理会伍修权和马立克所提出的明白地表明了美国侵略中国的事实。马立克指出：这是符合美国的传统的，美国惯于随随便便地抹煞那些驳斥美国和暴露美国的事实。
    马立克随后谈到杰伯的演说，痛斥杰伯为帝国主义的辩护者和积极的宣传者。马立克指出：杰伯关于英国在朝鲜负有军事任务的一段话，表明了美国和英国的立场并无不同，因为他们都在进行反对朝鲜人民的侵略战争。马立克援引了每日电讯与晨邮报合刊在十一月三日刊出的仑道夫·邱吉尔写的一篇文章，来揭露杰伯的伪善的遁词；该文指出：英国一方面承认中华人民共和国，一面却在台湾和国民党维持着军事上的联络。该文同时承认：杜鲁门的命令给第七舰队以与中国人民为敌的任务，因为他训令该舰队和任何从大陆向台湾逼进的军队作战。仑道夫·邱吉尔在提到美国的意图时写道：在台湾没有人相信美国正在准备在任何可想像得到的将来放弃台湾。马立克说：这一段坦率的说话表明美国已攫夺了台湾并且无意放弃它。它对于英国的真正立场的暴露证明了杰伯所说的英国的“大公无私”的立场是荒谬绝伦的，也证明了杰伯为什么不能对美国侵略台湾问题采取公正的态度。
    马立克批评美国和英国故意对控诉美国侵略台湾案只字不提，他指出：铁托代表力图淆乱这个问题，借以积极支持美国侵略者。马立克说：苏联代表团认为台湾问题是安全理事会的议程上首要的问题。安全理事会必须仔细研究侵略台湾的问题，并对这个问题作出公正的决定。不仅出席安全理事会的中华人民共和国代表要求公正的决定，而且四万七千五百万中国人民也要求公正的决定。中国人民正在等待安全理事会的公正的决定。马立克说：美国统治集团必须立即停止对台湾的侵略，并从台湾召回它的军队。
    中华人民共和国代表伍修仅将军接着发言。他痛斥美国代表奥斯汀在前次会议上的发言规避对于美国侵略台湾的控诉，却企图对中国人民措施诬蔑威吓。他在又一次揭露美国的侵略行为后，郑重表示中国人民完全有信心打退敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义侵略者，并要求安理会接受中华人民共和国的建议。（发言全文见另电）在伍修权发言后，安理会即行首先表决苏联九月二日的提案，这个提案要求谴责美国侵略台湾，并要求美军迅速撤出台湾和其他中国领土。安理会以一票赞成九票反对否决了苏联这个提案，印度未参加投票。
    安理会然后又以同样的票数否决了中华人民共和国所提出的建议，这些建议经苏联代表团作为提案正式提出，它要求：“一、联合国安全理事会公开谴责，并采取具体步骤严厉制裁美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾和武装干涉朝鲜的罪行；二、联合国安全理事会立即采取有效措施，使美国自台湾完全撤出它的武装侵略力量，以保证太平洋的与亚洲的和平与安全；三、联合国安全理事会立即采取有效措施，使美国及其他外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政由南北朝鲜人民自己解决，以和平处理朝鲜问题。”
    安理会接着表决六国提案。安全理事会应主席的要求分别表决这个提案的序文与实效部分。投票结果：提到安全理事会六月二十五日的决议、大会十月七日的决议和麦克阿瑟十一月五日的“特别报告”的该提案序文有八票赞成，苏联一票反对，一票弃权，印度未参加投票，由于有一个常任理事国投票反对而被否决。该提案的实效部分得到九票赞成票，苏联投票反对，印度未参加投票，也同样由于一个常任理事国投反对票被否决。接着主席要求表决整个提案。马立克反对说：这样做是不必要的，因为各部分都已经被否决。然而主席坚持要对整个提案进行表决，于是该提案被苏联的反对票所否决，其他九票赞成，印度未参加投票。会议至此休会。
    【新华社二日讯】纽约消息：安全理事会于十一月二十九日开会。继续讨论苏联控诉美国武装侵略台湾案，以及为美国代表团和讨好美国的安理会主席、铁托集团代表贝勃勒所无理硬拉到议程上来的所谓“对大韩民国的侵略”案。
    由于苏联代表马立克的要求，会议首先宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永十一月二十六日的来电，该电抗议美军在朝鲜的血腥暴行，并要求联合国采取制止这种暴行的措施。
    接着是李承晚傀儡集团的代表林炳稷发言，他奴颜婢膝地为美国侵略者掩饰，并无耻地为美国帮腔，肆意侮辱中国人民。
    国民党反动残余的所谓代表蒋廷黻继起就台湾问题发言。至此，中华人民共和国代表伍修权即行在会议桌前就座。在此次以前，伍修权代表曾拒绝在会议桌前就座而坐在贵宾席上，因为李承晚傀儡集团的代表是在就中华人民共和国中央人民政府所不同意参加讨论的议案发言。
    蒋廷黻在他以英语发表的演说中，无耻地为他的美国主子辩护，他硬说中国的小学教科书上证明，美国从来不是帝国主义，也从来没有侵略过中国。
    中华人民共和国代表伍修权在蒋廷黻发言后，作了如下的发言：“主席，各位代表：在我昨天的发言中，我已声明国民党反动残余集团的代表，根本无权代表中国，因此对他的发言，完全无答复的必要。国民党反动残余集团在联合国及其所属各机构中的所谓代表，他们除了为美国帝国主义者当应声虫外，便没有别的事可做了。我再一次提醒各位代表，为中国人民所唾弃的国民党反动残余集团的代表根本无权代表中国，我怀疑这个发言的人是不是中国人，因为伟大的四万七千五百万中国人民的语言他都不会讲。对中华人民共和国控诉美国武装侵略台湾案的讨论中，本代表声明保留继续发言权利。”
    下一个发言者法国代表萧维尔追述十一月十日法国和美国、英国、厄瓜多尔、古巴和挪威等六国曾联合提出一项提案，向中国政府“保证”中国和朝鲜之间的边界，同时要求“中国军队”自朝鲜撤退（据萧维尔说，已发现有“中国军队”出现）。萧维尔要求安全理事会对六国提案继续进行讨论。
    美国代表奥斯汀接着发言。他说了许多大肆攻击中国人民的粗鲁的话。奥斯汀接着进行狡辩，说美国在朝鲜的行动不能被视为侵略。他说美国军队侵入朝鲜是朝鲜局势所造成的，他建议对六国提案开始进行辩论。
    苏联代表马立克继起发言，他痛斥美国在朝鲜进行侵略，却强行盗用“联合国”的名义，并一再拒绝苏联的提案而阻挠在联合国大会与安全理事会上和平解决朝鲜战争。马立克指出：全世界都知道在朝鲜起决定性作用的军队是美国的军队。甚至英国首相艾德礼在下院回答邱吉尔的问题时，也承认朝鲜战争是美国进行的。美国侵略了朝鲜后，又显然非法和罪恶地侵犯三八线，开始向中国边境推进，并空袭中国境内，杀死了中国人民，毁坏了中国的财产，从而侵犯了中国领土。
    马立克接着驳斥奥斯汀为美国侵占台湾辩护的荒谬论据。他说：美国的行动违犯了国际法中一条尽人皆知的根本的公理——禁止干涉他国领土的原则。美国派遣军舰到台湾的动机，是基于战略上的考虑，以达到不使中国人民政府进入台湾的目的。而国际法中一项人人都知道的原则是，以海军对他国海岸和港口强行封锁的国家就是进攻的一方。马立克揭露美国所说中国政府在战争结束后到台湾来只是因为盟国要求中国政府接受日本投降这种法律论据的虚伪性。马立克指出：邀请中国政府受降是以将台湾完全归还中国的开罗协定为根据的。马立克继称：美国“欢迎”联合国考虑台湾问题的声明，其目的在于混淆世界舆论对于这个问题的看法。他说：美国声明的真正意思是：美国力图硬把这个问题加在联合国身上，以取消从前的决定。
    美国目前力图把“福摩萨问题”弄到联合国来，妄想改变台湾的法律地位与掩盖美国的侵略。
    马立克最后宣称：中国已要求安全理事会采取紧急措施，使美国把它的军队自朝鲜和台湾撤出。安全理事会的职责是在于维护侵略的受害者——中国，并立即采取步骤对付侵略者——美国。苏联代表团在向苏联政府请示之后，已提出一项提案，要求采取行动制止美国对中国的侵略。不幸这个提案迄未散发给安全理事会各理事，但可望于十一月三十日上午散发。同时，苏联亦支持中国代表伍修权所提的提案，所以苏联代表团提议把这个提案付诸表决。
