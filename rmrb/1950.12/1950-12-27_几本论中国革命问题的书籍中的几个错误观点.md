“Talks on the Chinese Revolution” by Chen Yuan, Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore, First Edition, July 1950

The above books on the Chinese Revolution contain several fundamental erroneous views, which may blur the reader's understanding. Therefore, it is necessary to criticize them.

I. On the Nature of the New Democratic Revolution - The current stage of the Chinese revolution is a New Democratic revolution, and the enemies it opposes are only imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Because it is not a socialist revolution, it does not negate the position and development of private capitalism. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in "On New Democracy": "The historical process of the Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps. The first step is the democratic revolution, and the second step is the socialist revolution..." In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," he further pointed out: "The national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage. ...In order to cope with the oppression of imperialism and to raise the backward economic status a step further, China must utilize all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, unite the national bourgeoisie, and fight together." However, the book "Study Handbook of the History of Social Development" confuses the New Democratic revolution with the socialist revolution, and broadly believes that "socialist or new democratic modes of production are not based on the exploitation system, but oppose the exploitation system." (Page 24) It also says, "...Only by completely overthrowing capitalism or the rule of capitalism, seizing power in hand, can we establish new socialist or new democratic relations of production." These are obviously incorrect views.

II. On the Issue of Leadership in the New Democratic Revolution - After the October Revolution, world history entered a new era of proletarian world revolution. The Chinese revolution, since the May Fourth Movement, has become a part of the proletarian world revolution. Due to the weakness of the bourgeoisie and the strength of the revolutionary enemies, and due to the emergence of the proletariat party - the Chinese Communist Party - and its correct leadership, only the proletariat class is the leading revolutionary force when Chinese history enters the stage of the New Democratic revolution. The Chinese revolution since the May Fourth Movement is a people's democratic revolution led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Since the May Fourth Movement, it is the proletariat party - the Chinese Communist Party - that clearly pointed out the objects of the Chinese revolution; it is the proletariat party - the Chinese Communist Party - that correctly proposed the program of the Chinese revolution; it is the proletariat party - the Chinese Communist Party - that united other classes with unparalleled revolutionary determination and exemplary behavior to fight heroically against the enemy. However, the book "New Democracy: Questions and Answers" says, "The New Democratic revolution in China was initially led jointly by the Chinese proletariat and the bourgeoisie." (Page 12) This is obviously another incorrect statement, a statement that is ignorant of the actual situation of the Chinese revolution.

III. On the National Form of the New Democratic Revolution - The book "Basic Questions of the Chinese Revolution" says, "In the national and political power issues of the New Democracy, there is the federal issue. All ethnic groups in China (including the Han and Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Yi, Yao ethnic minorities) should, based on the principles of voluntariness and democracy, organize the Federal Republic of China, and on the basis of this federation, organize the federal central government." (Page 79)

IV. On the United Front Issue - We know that the United Front policy is to win over and unite all classes and strata that can be united and should be united, to strive for the construction of a New Democratic country. Such unity is sincere, necessary, and also prescribed by objective conditions. In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao clearly pointed out the principles of interaction between the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie - that is, the various classes included in the concept of "the people": "For the people internally, a democratic system is implemented, giving freedom of speech, assembly, and association." "...Use democratic methods to educate and transform themselves, to free themselves from the influence of internal and external reactionaries, ..., to transform their bad habits and bad ideas from the old society..." However, the book "Talks on the Chinese Revolution" mistakenly used Chairman Mao's struggle strategy for eliminating revolutionary enemies as an explanation of the United Front policy for treating revolutionary friends. The book says, "Chairman Mao has four famous sentences that concisely summarize his United Front policy thinking, which is 'Utilize contradictions, win over the majority, oppose the minority, and defeat them one by one.' He has always grasped and implemented this idea at any time, so he will always be in an invincible position." (Page 51) This distorted error is extremely unforgivable.

I hope that the editors, authors, and publishers of the above-mentioned books can earnestly revise the erroneous and outdated views and statements pointed out above. I also hope that the readers who have purchased these books will pay attention to them and not create a misunderstanding.

    几本论中国革命问题的书籍中的几个错误观点
    俞杰
    “社会发展史学习手册”雪松著
    上海普文出版社一九五○年四月初版
    “新民主主义问答”  周生编  香港
    人民书店一九四九年十一月初版
    “中国革命基本问题”  王向升、刘毅合编  天津知识书店一九五○年三月四版
    “中国革命讲话”  陈远著  天津知识书店一九五○年七月初版
    上面几本关于中国革命问题的书籍，存在着若干原则性的错误观点；这些错误观点可能模糊读者的认识，因此对它们提出批评是必要的。
    一、关于新民主主义革命的性质问题——现阶段的中国革命是新民主主义的革命，它要反对的敌人只是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。因为它不是社会主义的革命，所以它并不否定私人资本主义的地位与发展。毛主席在“新民主主义论”中明确地指出：“中国革命的历史进程，必须分为两步，其第一步是民主主义革命，其第二步是社会主义革命，……”“论人民民主专政”中，他更指出：“民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。………为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。”可是“社会发展史学习手册”一书里，却把新民主主义革命与社会主义革命混为一谈，笼统地认为“社会主义或新民主主义的生产方式，都不是建立在剥削制度的基础上，而是反对剥削制度的。”（页二十四）又说“………只有彻底推翻资本主义，或资本主义的统治，夺取政权在手，才能建立起社会主义或新民主主义的新生产关系。”这些显然是不正确的看法。
    二、关于新民主主义革命的领导权问题——十月革命以后，世界历史就进入了无产阶级世界革命的新时代。中国革命从五四运动起，就成为无产阶级的世界革命的一部分。由于资产阶级的软弱与革命敌人的强大，由于无产阶级的政党——中国共产党的产生及其领导的正确，在中国历史步入新民主主义革命阶段时，即只有无产阶级一个阶级是革命的领导力量。五四以来的中国革命，就是以无产阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主革命。五四运动以来，明确地指出中国革命对象的是无产阶级的政党——中国共产党；正确地提出中国革命纲领的是无产阶级的政党——中国共产党；以无比的革命坚决性与模范行为团结其他阶级向敌人作英勇斗争的是无产阶级的政党——中国共产党。可是“新民主主义问答”一书里却说“中国的新民主主义革命，起先是由中国无产阶级与资产阶级共同领导着的。”（页十二）这显然又是一种不正确的说法，是昧于中国革命实际的说法。
    三、关于新民主主义革命的国家形式问题——“中国革命基本问题”一书中说“在新民主主义的国家问题与政权问题上，包含着联邦问题，中国境内各民族（包括汉族及满、蒙、回、藏、彝、徭各少数民族）应根据自愿与民主原则，组织中华人民共和国联邦，并在这个联邦基础上，组织联邦的中央政府。”（页七九）
    四、关于统一战线问题——我们知道，统一战线政策是争取和团结可能团结和应该团结的各阶级和阶层，为建设新民主主义国家而奋斗，这样的团结是真诚的，必要的，也是客观条件规定了的。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中，把工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级——即包括在“人民”这一概念里的各个阶级的相处原则，明确地指出：“对于人民内部，则实行民主制度，给予言论集会结社等项的自由权。”“……用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响，……，改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，……”可是“中国革命讲话”一书中，却把毛主席用来消灭革命敌人的斗争策略，错误地搬来作为对待革命友人的统一战线的政策的说明了。书中说“毛主席有四句名言，是扼要地概括了他的统一战线政策思想，即是“利用矛盾，争取多数，反对少数，各个击破。”他在任何时期，均掌握贯彻这一思想，因此就永远立于不败之地。”（页五一）这种歪曲的错误是极不可原谅的。
    对于上面指出的几本书籍中的错误的和过了时的看法和说法，我希望这几本书的编著者和出版者，能够切实修订。更希望曾经购买这几本书的读者们加以注意，不要造成一个错觉。
