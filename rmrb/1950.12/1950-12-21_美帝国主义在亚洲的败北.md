    The "general offensive" by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, attempting to "end the Korean War," has been decisively shattered under the powerful blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. American newspapers cannot help but admit that this is "one of the biggest defeats in the history of the American army." The facts prove that the imperialist aggression group's war plan in Korea is a complete loss.

    The failure of the United States in Korea is by no means due to accidental reasons, as some argue, such as the mismanagement of MacArthur's personal command. Rather, it is due to the profound political and social changes in Asia after World War II. The great victory of the Second World Anti-Fascist War fundamentally changed the political and social situation in Asia. The characteristics of this new situation are clearly manifested in the unprecedented growth of the strength of the Asian people and the unprecedented weakening of the strength of imperialism and its reactionary pillars in various countries. The people of the various colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, who actively participated in the victorious anti-fascist war and became aware and organized during the war, are no longer willing to live as they did in the past. Under the leadership of the Communist Parties in various countries, they have and are taking the destiny of their own countries into their own hands, resolutely struggling to overthrow the reactionary rule of the feudal comprador class in their countries, to smash the imperialist colonial slavery system, and for the freedom and independence of their motherlands. The great wave of liberation movements of the people of China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, India, and other countries has swept across the entire Asia. They have broken through and are breaking through the dark prisons of the old slavery system and order arranged for them by the long-term rule of imperialism and the feudal comprador reactionaries. The infinite revolutionary enthusiasm, the tenacious revolutionary perseverance and fighting spirit of the thousands upon thousands of awakened Eastern people are sweeping away all the roadblocks set up by imperialism and national reactionaries with overwhelming force and courageously advancing. The victorious and great turning-over era of the Eastern people, who account for more than half of the world's population, has arrived.

    In the face of this great people's liberation movement, the reactionaries of various Asian countries appear so isolated and helpless in the ocean of the people, so weak and powerless, that they cannot but sell themselves further to imperialism in order to eke out a living and maintain their faltering and collapsing reactionary rule. The like of Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Yoshida, Bao Dai, Phibun, and Quirino cannot survive a single day without the "assistance" of their foreign masters. This situation further infuriates the people of various Asian countries, making them more closely link the struggle against foreign imperialism with the struggle against domestic feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism. This situation greatly expands the scale of the struggle, greatly raises the level of the struggle, and thus greatly increases the strength of the struggle. This struggle naturally further shakes the foundation of the entire imperialist rule in Asian colonies and semi-colonies; and the entire imperialist rule in Asia, although it has suffered a serious blow in the Second World Anti-Fascist War and after its victory. Japan, the pillar of imperialism in Asia, has been overthrown, and the ruling power of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia has also been greatly weakened. This weakening of imperialist forces naturally creates more favorable conditions for the liberation movement of the Asian people. This is the new situation in Asia. And this new situation is occurring under the international conditions that the strength of the world peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union is extremely strong and is constantly consolidating and growing. Therefore, it makes the struggle of the Asian people more confident of victory; and makes the final defeat of imperialism in Asia closer.

    Under this new situation in Asia, U.S. imperialism, which made a fortune in the Second World War, vainly attempted to replace the former Japanese imperialism and squeeze out the imperialist forces of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia, actively implementing its expansion policy in Asia in order to achieve its goal of dominating Asia and establishing a "new order" of U.S. imperialism in Asia. It wants to be the sole slave owner of the Asian people, it wants to be the emperor who rides on the backs of the Asian people, makes a show of force and issues orders. Swollen financial imperialism naturally has a wild and aggressive plan to dominate the world and dominate Asia. It is arrogant, arbitrary, fierce, and greedy. It is conceited and imposing. It completely ignores the Asian people. U.S. imperialism has since become the most important and most ferocious enemy of the Asian people.

    In order to dominate Asia, U.S. imperialism thought that it must first dominate China. Because China is the largest country in Asia, has the richest raw materials and strategic materials, has the largest market for American industrial and agricultural products, and also has the cheapest labor that can be exploited and squeezed, the most manpower that can be used for its aggression, and the largest war base that can be used to attack the Soviet Union. When Japanese imperialism implemented its so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" in the past, it followed the path of "If you want to conquer Asia, you must first conquer China." U.S. imperialism copied Japan's old path and first concentrated its efforts on conquering China. It used the greatest material resources, financial resources, and considerable military force to support the reactionary government of the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. It controlled all the political, economic, and military key points in the Kuomintang-controlled area at that time, and actually turned the Kuomintang reactionary regime into its puppet. The U.S. imperialists were really beside themselves with joy. They were convinced that China was definitely in their pocket, and therefore Asia could be easily obtained. This was, of course, the U.S. imperialists' beautiful wish at that time! However, these arrogant and greedy American tycoons completely miscalculated. They completely overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the Eastern people! The Chinese people first gave this arrogant plan of U.S. imperialism to dominate Asia a decisive blow. The Chinese people thoroughly defeated U.S. imperialism and its puppet Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries on the Chinese mainland, and established the great People's Republic of China headed by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

    The victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China is not only a fundamental transformation in the history of the Chinese people, but also a fundamental transformation in the history of the Asian countries enslaved by British and American imperialism. This victory further promoted the awakening of the Asian people, encouraged their courage to fight, and enhanced their confidence in victory, raising the people's liberation struggle of the Asian people against British and American imperialism to a new stage. The Asian people have learned and are learning from the example of the victory of the Chinese revolution the rich experience of how to defeat imperialism and its puppet rule. The victorious People's Republic of China is like the rising sun, illuminating the path of victory for all oppressed people in Asia with brilliant brilliance. This victory has separated the great China, with a land of ten million square kilometers and a population of 475 million, from the political, economic, and military system of imperialism enslaving the Asian people; not only separated, but also turned into an unprecedentedly huge force to destroy this system. It has become a reliable and strong fortress of peace and democracy for Asian people on the Asian continent, and it is also closely linked with the great Soviet Union through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Obviously, the system of imperialism enslaving colonial and semi-colonial people in Asia has been opened up a huge gap here. This gap is so large that the entire imperialist colonial system in Asia has suffered a serious rupture. This is a great victory for the Asian people and a great victory for the world peace, democracy, and socialism camp. On the contrary, for U.S. imperialism, this is the biggest failure it has encountered in Asia for the first time. This failure also determined its many subsequent failures, until its final failure. The reason is very obvious, since if you want to conquer Asia, you must first conquer China; then if you cannot conquer China, of course you cannot conquer Asia; then, the failure to conquer China, of course, foreshadows the failure to conquer Asia.

    U.S. imperialism is, of course, very heartbroken about its failure in China. The White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations published by the U.S. State Department in August 1949 had to publicly admit the fact of its disastrous defeat in China. However, U.S. imperialism is still not reconciled to the victory of the liberation movement of the colonial and semi-colonial people. U.S. imperialism continues to intensify its aggression against Asian countries, attempting to turn Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, etc. into their colonies, and to turn them into military bases for preparing to attack New China. They attach particular importance to the position of Japan and Korea, because relying on Japan as a base to conquer Korea, and then through Korea to invade New China, seems to U.S. imperialism to be the most convenient shortcut, just as Japanese imperialism tried in the past when it invaded China. They fully support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who fled from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, turning Taiwan into a military base for attacking the Chinese mainland, and strengthening the sabotage activities of special agents and bandits on the Chinese mainland. They are implementing further economic and military assistance to the so-called "independent" Philippines, making it a base for attacking New China from the South Pacific. They resolutely rejected the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations, and used the name of the United Nations to oppose New China. All these war preparation steps of U.S. imperialism have developed to the point of launching a direct armed war of aggression against Korea.

    In the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism vainly attempted to use its navy, army, and air force, its warships, airplanes, tanks, and various so-called "new weapons" to massively slaughter the Korean people who demanded freedom, unification, and independence, and to destroy all peaceful cities and villages in Korea, in order to intimidate the Korean people, overwhelm their resistance, and thus conquer them. At the same time, it openly occupied our territory of Taiwan, violated our territorial waters and airspace, and used airplanes to bomb and strafe our people in Northeast China, attempting to directly introduce the flames of war into the Chinese mainland, thereby launching a war of aggression against New China. In addition, in the war of aggression, U.S. imperialism also stole the signboard of the "United Nations" to obtain so-called moral or material and strength assistance from "fifty-three countries" to enhance its influence. Obviously, direct, barbaric, and brutal armed aggression has become the last trump card for U.S. imperialism to save its crumbling colonial rule. However, this open armed intervention by U.S. imperialism, and the unprecedentedly barbaric and brutal acts of slaughter and destruction used by U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Korea, are not enough to show the strength of the United States. On the contrary, this shows its even greater weakness and its dead-end situation. At the same time, this behavior not only did not intimidate the people of China and Korea, but also aroused great anger among the people of China and Korea, as well as all Asian people and world people. Especially in China, this behavior of U.S. imperialism has aroused a nationwide and all-people high tide of the national liberation movement of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, and has emerged heroic People's Volunteer Forces that combine patriotism and internationalism of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. As a result, the war of aggression against Korea, which U.S. imperialism thought could win, failed miserably once again. When the war first started, the U.S. troops suffered a powerful blow from the Korean People's Army, causing them to retreat all the way to the Daegu-Busan line. Although after much preparation and reinforcement, it was able to carry out the Incheon Landing on September 15, temporarily changing the war situation and turning from retreat to attack. It was extremely vicious and reckless, ignoring all warnings, and ventured across the 38th parallel, marching straight to the Sino-Korean border, vainly attempting to achieve its complete victory in the aggression against Korea before Christmas. But the "victory" gained from that time's attack proved to be temporary. The Korean People's Army, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces, quickly turned to the counteroffensive, giving the U.S. aggressor forces a much more serious annihilation blow than the first time. The attempt of U.S. imperialism to use war to overwhelm the people of China and Korea and the people of Asia has suffered the greatest historical failure. This failure is something that even U.S. imperialists have to admit. They cannot help but be shocked by the heroic and good fighting, the fearless of difficulties, and the tenacious fighting spirit of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces! They were stunned by the heroic spirit of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces in advancing bravely under the bombing of American airplanes and artillery! They do not understand where this great driving force of the Eastern people comes from?! Of course, this is also something that imperialists can never understand. Only the people who are righteous, anti-aggression, and fighting for the survival of their own nation can infinitely exert the great power contained in them!

    This victory in the Korean War pointed out to all the people in Asia that the armed forces of U.S. imperialism and other imperialists, and their so-called new weapons, can be completely defeated, just as the victory of the Chinese revolution proved that all the material, financial, and military assistance of U.S. imperialism to the reactionaries of a country can also be completely defeated. This victory further encouraged the fighting courage of the people of various Asian countries and further enhanced their confidence in winning the final victory.

    This victory in the Korean War severely undermined the ferocity of U.S. imperialism, cut off its devil's claws extended to the Chinese mainland, weakened its military strength in Asia, increased its domestic and foreign difficulties, and caused it to be utterly defeated in front of the people of Asia and the people of the world, thus creating more favorable conditions for the liberation struggle of the people of various Asian countries and the people of the world.

    All the people of China, all the people of Asia, and all the people of the world should be further convinced from this that only the power of the people can determine the fate of human history. The imperialist aggressors have become paper tigers full of holes. Every blow that the people of the world give it in the future will further promote its internal contradictions and make it collapse faster. It can be asserted, since the imperialists are unwilling to change their aggressive plans, since they are determined to continue their war policy, then the political crisis they are caught in will inevitably become more serious. The death of the imperialist system is doomed. We Chinese people have already experienced all the conspiracies and all the brutalities of the imperialists. Based on our personal experience, we can firmly believe that together with the people of the world headed by the Soviet Union, we are fully capable of crushing any provocation by the imperialists.

    On the one hand, U.S. imperialism has already been defeated in Asia, and will continue to suffer more miserable defeats; on the other hand, the Chinese people, united under the banner of Mao Zedong and allied with the Soviet Union, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, have become the masters of their own country and the center of gravity of the power of the Asian people. This is the fundamental characteristic of the current situation in the Far East. Our people cannot but be concerned about all Eastern issues and other major world issues that are closely related to our interests. If the imperialists violate or ignore the will of the Chinese people on the China issue and all issues related to China's interests, they will surely run into a brick wall. This firm and unyielding will of the Chinese people has been fully demonstrated in the voluntary action of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. Our people insist that a truly reasonable, democratic, and peaceful principle must be adopted to resolve the Korean issue, and that the U.S. and other countries' aggressive forces in Korea must be withdrawn immediately and completely; we insist on the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. aggressive forces that invaded our Taiwan, and that our country obtain its due position in the United Nations. This is the firm position of our Chinese people and the only way to ensure peace in Asia.

### 美帝国主义在亚洲的败北

    美帝国主义在亚洲的败北
    美帝国主义的侵略军企图“结束朝鲜战争”的“总攻势”，在朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的有力打击下，已经决定地破产了。美国报纸不能不承认这是“美国军队历史上的一个最大的失败”。事实证明帝国主义侵略集团在朝鲜的战争计划是全盘输定了的。
    美国在朝鲜的失败，决不是由于什么偶然的原因，如像关于麦克阿瑟个人指挥的失当等等论调中所说的那样，而是由于二次世界大战后在亚洲深刻变化了的政治的社会的原因。二次世界反法西斯战争的伟大胜利，根本改变了亚洲的政治的社会的形势。这种新形势的特点，清楚地表现在亚洲各国人民力量的空前壮大，以及帝国主义及其各国反动支柱的力量的空前削弱。积极参加了胜利的反法西斯战争并且在战争中觉悟起来与组织起来的亚洲各殖民地与半殖民地国家的人民，已经不愿再照老样子生活下去了，它们已经和正在各国共产党领导下把他们自己国家的命运抓在自己的手里，为推翻本国的封建买办的反动统治，为粉碎帝国主义的殖民地奴役制度，为祖国的自由与独立而进行坚决的斗争了。中国、朝鲜、日本、越南、菲律宾、马来亚、印尼、缅甸、印度等各国人民的解放运动的伟大浪潮，席卷了整个的亚洲。他们已经冲破了并且还在冲破着长时期的帝国主义与封建买办的反动统治给他们安排下的奴隶的旧制度与旧秩序的黑暗的牢狱。千千万万觉醒过来的东方人民的无穷的革命积极性，坚韧不拔的革命毅力与战斗精神，正在以排山倒海之势扫除着帝国主义与民族反动派所设下的一切路障而勇敢前进。占全世界人口一半以上的东方人民的胜利的伟大的翻身时代，已经到来了。
    在这一伟大的人民解放运动前面，亚洲各国的反动派，在人民的海洋中显得如此的孤立无援，如此的软弱无力，以至他们不能不更加卖身投靠于帝国主义，以苟延残喘，以维持其动摇崩溃着的反动统治。蒋介石、李承晚、吉田、保大、銮披汶、季里诺之流，没有其外国主子们的“援助”，是不能一日生存下去的。而这种情况更激怒了亚洲各国人民，使他们把反对外国帝国主义与反对本国封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争，更密切地联系起来了。这种情况，大大扩大了斗争的规模，大大提高了斗争的水平，因而大大增加了斗争的力量。这种斗争自然更动摇了整个帝国主义在亚洲殖民地与半殖民地统治的基础；而整个帝国主义在亚洲的统治，在二次世界反法西斯战争中及其胜利以后，虽然已经受到了严重的打击。作为亚洲帝国主义支柱的日本已经被打倒了，英、法、荷在亚洲的统治力量，也已经大大削弱了。帝国主义力量的这种削弱，自然给亚洲人民的解放运动，更加造成了有利的条件。这就是亚洲的新形势。而这种新形势，更发生在以苏联为首的世界和平、民主与社会主义的阵营的力量极为强大，并在不断巩固与生长的国际条件之下。因此，它使亚洲人民的斗争，更有胜利的把握；使帝国主义在亚洲的最后失败，更加接近。
    在亚洲的这种新形势之下，在二次世界大战中唯一发了横财的肿胀了的美国帝国主义，却妄图代替过去的日本帝国主义，并排挤英、法、荷等在亚洲的帝国主义势力，积极实施其在亚洲的扩张政策，以达到其独霸亚洲，建立美帝国主义在亚洲的“新秩序”的目的。它想充当亚洲人民的唯一的奴隶主，它想充当骑在亚洲人民的背上作威作福、发号施令的太上皇。肿胀的金元帝国主义，自然要有狂妄的独霸世界、独霸亚洲的侵略计划。它骄横武断、凶狠贪婪。它妄自尊大，气焰逼人。它完全不把亚洲人民放在眼里。美帝国主义从此成为亚洲人民的最主要的与最凶恶的敌人了。
    美帝国主义为了独霸亚洲，它就想到了首先必须独霸中国。因为中国是亚洲最大的国家，有最丰富的原料与战略物资，有最广大的美国工业品与农业品的市场，还有最廉价的可以剥削榨取的劳动力，最多的可以被利用供其侵略驱使的人力，最大的可以作为进攻苏联的战争基地。日本帝国主义过去在实施其所谓“大东亚共荣圈”时，是曾经循着这条“欲征服亚洲，必先征服中国”的道路前进的。美帝国主义照抄着日本的老路，也首先集中力量于征服中国。它曾经用最大的物力、财力与相当大的军力，支持蒋介石国民党反动政府，它曾经控制了当时国民党统治区域内的一切政治、经济、与军事要害，实际上做到了把国民党反动政权变成了它的傀儡。美帝国主义者真是得意忘形了。它满以为中国已经肯定地是它的囊中之物了，因而亚洲也就可以垂手而得。这当然是美帝国主义者当时的美好愿望！然而这些骄横贪婪的美国大亨们，完全打错了算盘。他们完全错误地过高估计了他们自己的力量，而过低估计了东方人民的力量！中国人民首先给了美帝国主义的这种狂妄的独霸亚洲的计划，以决定性的打击。中国人民彻底打败了美帝国主义及其傀儡蒋介石反动派在中国大陆上的统治，而建立了中国人民自己的以伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东主席为首的伟大的中华人民共和国。
    中国人民的胜利，中华人民共和国的建立，这不但是中国人民历史上的根本的转变，而且也是被美英帝国主义所奴役的亚洲各国人民历史上的根本转变。这一胜利，进一步促进了亚洲人民的觉醒，鼓舞了他们斗争的勇气，提高了他们胜利的信心，把亚洲人民反对美英帝国主义的人民解放斗争提高到了一个新的阶段。亚洲人民从中国革命胜利的榜样中，吸收了与吸收着如何战胜帝国主义及其傀儡统治的丰富的斗争经验。胜利的中华人民共和国正像初升的朝阳，以灿烂的光辉照耀着亚洲一切被压迫人民胜利前进的道路。这一胜利，使一千万平方公里的土地，使四万七千五百万人口的伟大的中国，脱离了帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的政治的、经济的与军事的体系；不但脱离了，而且变成了摧毁这一体系的空前巨大的力量。它变成了亚洲人民在亚洲大陆上一个亚洲人的可靠的坚强的和平与民主的堡垒，而且它又以中苏友好同盟互助条约，同伟大的苏联密切的联系起来了。显然，帝国主义在亚洲奴役殖民地与半殖导地人民的体系，在这里已被打开了一个巨大的缺口，这个缺口是如此之大，以致使整个的帝国主义在亚洲的殖民地体系，发生了严重的破裂。这是亚洲人民的伟大胜利，也是世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营的伟大胜利。相反的，对于美帝国主义说来，这是它在亚洲第一次碰到的最大的一次失败。这一失败也就决定了它以后的许多次的失败，一直到它的最后失败。道理是非常明显的，既然欲征服亚洲，必先征服中国；那末不能征服中国，当然也就无法征服亚洲；那末，征服中国的失败，当然就预示着征服亚洲的失败。
    美帝国主义对于它在中国的失败，当然是十分痛心的。一九四九年八月美国国务院发表的《中美关系》的白皮书，曾经不得不公开承认了它在中国的这种惨败的事实。但是，美帝国主义还不甘心于殖民地半殖民地人民的解放运动的胜利。美帝国主义仍继续加紧对亚洲各国的侵略行动，企图把朝鲜、日本、越南、泰国等都变为他们的殖民地，并且变为准备进攻新中国的军事基地。他们特别重视日本和朝鲜的地位，因为依靠日本为基地，以征服朝鲜，然后经过朝鲜去侵略新中国，在美帝国主义看来似乎是一条最为便利的捷径，正像日本帝国主义过去侵略中国时所尝试过的一样。他们全力支援从中国大陆逃往台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，把台湾变成进攻中国大陆的军事基地，并经过他们加强在中国大陆上的特务土匪的破坏活动。他们对所谓“独立”的菲律宾实行进一步的经济的与军事的援助，使之成为从南太平洋进攻新中国的基地。他们坚决排斥中华人民共和国的合法代表进入联合国，并且盗用联合国的名义反对新中国。美帝国主义者一切这些准备战争的步骤，一直发展到对于朝鲜发动了直接的武装侵略战争。
    在侵略朝鲜的战争中，美帝国主义妄想以它的海陆空军，以它的军舰、飞机、坦克以及各种所谓“新式武器”，来大量屠杀要求自由统一与独立的朝鲜人民，破坏朝鲜的一切和平的城市与乡村，来吓倒朝鲜人民，压倒他们的反抗，从而征服他们。同时，它公开侵占我国领土台湾，侵犯我国领海领空，用飞机轰炸与扫射我东北人民，企图把战争火焰直接引到中国大陆，借以发动对新中国的侵略战争。此外，在侵略战争中，美帝国主义者还盗用了“联合国”的招牌，取得“五十三国”的所谓道义的或是物资的、实力的援助，以壮声势。显然的，直接的野蛮的残暴的武装侵略，已经成为美帝国主义者挽救其摇摇欲坠的殖民地统治的最后一张王牌了。然而美帝国主义的这种公开的武装干涉，美帝国主义在侵朝战争中所使用的那种空前野蛮残暴的屠杀与毁灭的行为，并不足以表示出美国力量的强大，相反的，这正表示出了它的力量的更加脆弱，及它的穷途末路的处境。同时，这种行为不但没有吓倒中国的与朝鲜的人民，而且在中国与朝鲜人民中间，以及所有亚洲人民及世界人民中间，激起了极大的愤怒。尤其在中国，美帝国主义的这种行为激起了全国性的与全民性的中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的民族解放运动的高潮，并涌现出了抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的英勇的人民志愿部队。因之，美帝国主义满以为可操胜算的对朝鲜的侵略战争，又一次悲惨地失败了。当战争一开始，美国军队，即遭受了朝鲜人民军的有力打击，使之一直败退到大邱釜山之线。虽然经过了很大的准备与增援之后，才能于九月十五日实行仁川登陆，暂时改变了战争形势，从败退转入了进攻。它穷凶极恶，不顾一切警告，冒险越过三八线，直向中朝边境进军，妄想在圣诞节前取得其侵略朝鲜的完全胜利。但是那一时进攻所得的“胜利”，证明仍然是暂时的。朝鲜人民军在中国人民志愿部队的支援下，迅速转入了反攻，给了美国侵略军远比第一次更为严重的歼灭性的打击。美帝国主义者想用战争压倒中朝二国人民及亚洲人民的企图，遭受了历史性的最大的失败了。这种失败，就是美帝国主义者也不得不承认。他们不能不为朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿部队的那种英勇善战，不怕困难，不怕牺牲的顽强的战斗精神所震惊！他们为朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队在美国飞机大炮的轰炸下所表现出来的那种奋勇直前的英雄气概，而吓得目瞪口呆！他们不了解东方人民的这种伟大的冲击力究竟从何而来？！当然这也是帝国主义者所绝不能了解的。只有正义的、反侵略的、为了民族自己的生存而战斗的人民，才能无穷无尽的发挥他们中所蕴藏着的伟大的力量！
    朝鲜战争的这一胜利，在全亚洲人民前面指出了美帝国主义的以及其他帝国主义的武装力量，以及它们的所谓新式武器，是完全可以被打败的，正像在中国革命的胜利中证明了美帝国主义对于一国反动派的一切物力、财力、军力的援助，也是完全可以被打败的一样。这一胜利，进一步的鼓舞了亚洲各国人民的斗争勇气，进一步提高了它们争取最后胜利的信心。
    朝鲜战争的这一胜利，沉重地打垮了美帝国主义的凶焰，斩断了它伸向中国大陆的魔手，削弱了它在亚洲的军事力量，增加了它的国内外的困难，使它在亚洲人民以及在全世界人民前面一败涂地，因而给亚洲各国人民以及全世界人民的解放斗争，造成了更为有利的条件。
    全中国人民、全亚洲和全世界人民都应该由此进一步确信，只有人民的力量能够决定人类历史的命运。帝国主义侵略者已经成为百孔千疮的纸老虎了。今后世界人民所给予它的每一个打击，都将更加促进它的内部矛盾，使它更快地崩溃下去。可以断定，既然帝国主义者不愿意改变他们的侵略计划，既然他们决心继续其战争政策，那末，他们所陷入的政治危机必然将更加严重。帝国主义制度的死亡是注定了的。我们中国人民对于帝国主义者的一切阴谋和一切残暴，都已经领略过了。根据我们的亲身经历，可以坚定地相信，和以苏联为首的世界人民在一起，我们完全能够粉碎帝国主义的任何挑衅。
    在一方面，美帝国主义在亚洲是已经败北了，而且将要继续遭受更悲惨的败北；在另一方面，在毛泽东旗帜下团结一致并与苏联结成同盟的占世界人口四分之一的中国人民，已经成了自己国家的主人，成了亚洲人民力量的重心。这就是今天远东形势的根本特点。我国人民不能不关心与我们有密切利害关系的一切东方问题和其他重大的世界问题。帝国主义者在对中国问题和与中国有利害关系的一切问题上，如果违背或忽视中国人民的意志，都一定会碰得头破血流。中国人民的这种坚强不拔的意志，在抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动上，已经充分表现出来了。我国人民坚持对于朝鲜问题必须采取真正合理的民主和平的原则来解决，立即全部撤退美国及其他国家在朝鲜的侵略军队；我们坚持立即撤退侵略我国台湾的美国侵略武力，并使我国在联合国获得应有的地位。这是我们中国人民的坚定主张，也是保障亚洲和平的唯一道路。
