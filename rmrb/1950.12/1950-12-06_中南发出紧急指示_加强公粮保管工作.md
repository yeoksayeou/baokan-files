    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, November 30th: During this autumn grain collection in the Central South region, farmers enthusiastically paid their public grain, resulting in very rapid entry into the granaries. As a result, a small amount of grain was stored before it was fully dried. Serious phenomena of public grain heating and insect infestation have been successively discovered in warehouses in Xishui County, Hubei Province, and Yangshuo County, Guangxi Province. To this end, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee has issued an urgent directive on "Strengthening Public Grain Storage and Rapidly Salvaging Spoiled Grain," ordering all localities to immediately inspect warehouses. If there is any heating or insect infestation, the grain should be immediately turned over and sun-dried. The directive emphasizes: We should oppose the phenomenon of grain collection cadres only encouraging farmers to pay quickly, not waiting for farmers to dry and clean the grain, not educating farmers to pay good grain, and even using the excuse of being afraid of affecting farmers' enthusiasm for payment, not allowing grain receiving personnel to inspect. The directive points out that this is a one-sided so-called mass viewpoint. At the same time, we should also oppose the phenomenon of grain receiving and warehouse personnel abandoning their duties, collecting grain carelessly, and managing improperly. The directive also points out: Due to this one-sided so-called mass viewpoint and careless grain collection, a very small number of illegal landlords and bad elements were able to mix their bad grain into the warehouses, damaging the public grain.
    Currently, the provinces in Central South are universally inspecting warehouses and handling heated and insect-infested grain. Hunan Province has dispatched a group of technical personnel to the countryside to prevent and control rice insect pests.

    中南发出紧急指示
    加强公粮保管工作
    【新华社汉口十一月三十日电】中南区各省这次秋征，农民踊跃缴纳下公粮入仓极快，致有少数粮食未完全干燥就已灌仓，湖北省浠水县、广西省阳朔县等地仓库，已先后发现了公粮发热、生虫的严重现象。为此，中南军政委员会财经委员会，已发出“加强公粮保管、迅速抢救坏粮”的紧急指示，责令各地立即检查仓库，如有发热生虫现象马上倒仓翻晒。指示强调：应反对征粮干部只鼓动农民快缴，不等农民把粮食晒干扬净，不教育农民缴好粮，甚至借口怕影响农民缴纳热情，不让收粮人员检查的现象。指示指出这是片面的所谓群众观点。同时也反对收粮、仓库人员放弃职守，马虎收粮和管理不周的现象。指示并指出：由于这种片面的所谓群众观点，马虎收粮的结果，使极少数的不法地主和坏分子，得以将其坏粮食混入仓库，破坏公粮。
    现中南各省已在普遍检查仓库和处理发热、生虫粮食。湖南省为此已派遣了一批防治稻谷虫害的技术人员下乡。
