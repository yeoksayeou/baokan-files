Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Large-scale winter repair projects on major rivers in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces commenced in mid-November. In Hebei Province, the key winter repair projects this year focus on the embankment repair and dredging of the Qinglongwan River and Kuangergang River in the Chaobai River system, the renovation of dangerous sections of the Yongding River, and the embankment line repair of the Jiyun River, requiring a total of 3.28 million cubic meters of earthwork. In Pingyuan Province, the winter work focuses on repairing the embankments of the Yellow River and Qin River, and repairing the Jinxianling embankment, requiring a total of 3.5 million cubic meters of earthwork and 100,000 cubic meters of stone, accounting for about one-third of the total river management project next year. The above projects are expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Prior to the winter repairs, both Hebei and Pingyuan provinces made full preparations. A total of 80,000 laborers were mobilized in Pingyuan Province to participate in the construction, and more than 40,000 laborers were mobilized in Hebei Province for the renovation of the Chaobai River system alone. Special attention was paid to the food and lodging of the laborers in various places, and cold-proof barracks were generally set up at various construction sites, thus overcoming the difficulties of cold weather, food, and lodging. A large number of medical personnel were also equipped in various construction sections to ensure the health of the laborers. In order to accelerate the completion of the winter repair projects, labor competitions were widely carried out among the laborers in various places during the winter repairs. In the Yellow River section of Pingyuan Province, more than 100 heroes and model workers emerged in the competition. Zhao Ji, a hero in dike construction from Shouzhang County, created a new record of 29.4 cubic meters of earthwork per day. Laborers along the rivers in Hebei Province also guaranteed the standards of this year's winter repair projects.

    河北、平原两省
    冬修工程先后开工
    【新华社九日讯】河北、平原两省各大河流的大规模冬修工程已于上月中旬先后开工。河北省今年以潮白河系的青龙湾河、筐儿港河的培修疏浚和永定河的整修险工、蓟运河的堤线修整为冬修重点，共需土方三百二十八万方。平原省今冬则整修黄河、沁河堤和补修金线岭堤，共需三百五十万土方和运石十万方，约占明年全部治河工程的三分之一。上述工程预计年底即可完成。
    在冬修前，河北、平原两省均进行了充分的准备工作。平原省共动员八万民工参加修建，河北省仅整修潮白河系即动员四万多民工。各地对民工的食宿照顾尤为周到，各施工地点普遍架设御寒营房，因而克服了寒冷和食宿的困难。各施工地段并配备了大批医疗人员，使民工的健康得以保证。为加速完成冬修工程，各地民工在冬修中普遍开展了劳动竞赛。平原省黄河段在竞赛中，涌现出一百多名英雄模范。寿张县修堤英雄赵继，创造了每日二十九点四土方的新纪录。河北各河民工并保证今年冬修工程的标准。
