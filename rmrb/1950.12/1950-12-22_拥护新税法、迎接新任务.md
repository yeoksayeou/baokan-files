    Supporting the New Tax Law and Embracing New Tasks

    The tax work for 1951 bears very significant political and economic responsibilities. Because our country is under the threat of the war of aggression launched by American imperialism, not only is it urgent to strengthen national defense, but the efforts to stabilize finance and prices cannot be neglected. Under these circumstances, guaranteeing the completion of tax revenue tasks to consolidate the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure is a very important task.

    An important condition for ensuring the smooth progress of tax work lies in the formulation and implementation of a unified national tax law. Without a unified tax law, unreasonable phenomena of excessively light or heavy tax burdens will inevitably occur. This phenomenon not only affects taxpayers' perception of the People's Government but also, to a certain extent, can affect the normal state of social and economic life. Therefore, balancing the tax burden of taxpayers nationwide is one of the most fundamental principles of our people's democratic state's tax policy.

    The State Council of the Central People's Government recently promulgated several important tax laws in a timely manner, including: the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax, the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax, the Provisional Regulations on Interest Income Tax, the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, the Provisional Regulations on Slaughter Tax, the General Rules for the Organization of Democratic Appraisal Committees for Industrial and Commercial Tax, and the General Rules for the Organization of Tax Review Committees. The promulgation of these tax laws is a major event in the country's financial work.

    The main content of the above-mentioned new tax laws is based on the revised opinions decided at the Second National Tax Conference attended by representatives from the national industrial and commercial sectors in June this year, and approved by the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Some of the parts that could be implemented in advance were announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council on June 29 and stipulated to be implemented nationwide from July 1. Although these tax laws cannot yet be regarded as the most complete tax laws of our New Democratic state, and some parts of them still have a transitional nature, they were formulated based on the current actual situation of the country's financial economy, based on the principles stipulated in Article 40 of the Common Program regarding tax work, and summarizing the experience of tax work over the past year. Without a doubt, it is the best tax law that can be formulated at present.

    After the promulgation of the new tax law, the most important issue is how to resolutely implement it. What issues should be paid attention to and resolved when implementing the new tax law?

    First, the unified tax law must be implemented. Over the past year, tax authorities in various regions have generally done a good job in complying with the central government's tax laws and regulations. Tax staff in various regions have generally been able to work hard and conscientiously, completed the tax tasks stipulated by the central government, and generally grasped the correct principle of taking both public and private interests into consideration, and taking care of the actual difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors. However, tax authorities in individual regions have shortcomings in implementation. These shortcomings include: emphasizing the particularities of the locality and promulgating tax rules, items, and rates on their own without the approval of the central government; overstepping the authority to interpret tax laws and independently deciding on collection and exemption standards; and refusing to earnestly implement the collection methods stipulated in the tax law. These practices that violate the principle of unified tax administration and tax law not only have a negative impact on the political prestige of the People's Government but also have an adverse impact on the social economy and tax revenue itself. All of these should be corrected.

    Secondly, the industrial and commercial sectors should assist in the implementation of the new tax law. The facts of the past six months have shown that the majority of legitimate industrialists and business people across the country enthusiastically support the policy of adjusting taxes, and the tax obligations fulfilled by the industrial and commercial sectors have also made a great contribution to the country. However, there are still some industrial and commercial households in various regions who lack a correct understanding of their tax obligations, one-sidedly emphasize their own difficulties, and fail to take into account the country's difficulties. Therefore, in tax payment, there have been democratic appraisals with more than ten consultations without results; there have also been cases of making false accounts and adopting other methods to evade taxes. As a result, in the tax burden of industrial and commercial households in some larger cities, after correcting the bias of excessively heavy burdens, the phenomenon of excessively light burdens has become more common; the phenomenon of arrears in tax payments in some places is still quite serious. There is no doubt that this phenomenon is very detrimental to the country's tax revenue. Therefore, the tax work in these areas must be rectified. Resolute and effective correction should be made to tax evasion and tax arrears. Here, it must be emphasized that tax work should not only achieve "assessment according to rates" but also "payment to the treasury on schedule." On the one hand, it is necessary to protect legitimate industrialists and business people who pay taxes according to the law, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to punish some elements who illegally evade or default on taxes in order to achieve a balance and reasonableness in the burden of taxpayers.

    Thirdly, the erroneous view that tasks and policies cannot be unified should be used as an opportunity with the promulgation of this new tax law to conduct a general education among tax cadres to thoroughly overcome it. The tax law represents the tax policy of the People's Government, and the decision of the tax law is based on the ability to complete the tax tasks required by the state. Earnestly implementing the tax law is basically to complete the task. The statement that considering the policy means not being able to consider the task is not a true understanding of the basis for formulating the policy. In addition, some comrades only value the task and do not value the policy. They say: "Dead tasks, flexible policies." Although their motivation for resolutely completing the task is correct, their view of not valuing the policy and opposing the task to the policy is wrong. Because policy is the track for the party and the government to connect with the masses and realize the task, not doing things according to the policy will inevitably separate from the masses and inevitably fail to correctly complete the task.

    Fourth, in order to ensure that the new tax law can be implemented, the leading organs in various regions should pay attention to the situation of tax cadres. This is a major link in guaranteeing tax revenue. After the central government issued the decision to unify financial and economic work in March this year, the leading party and government organs in various regions have made great achievements in this regard. However, there are still phenomena of insufficient implementation in individual regions. Especially after the adjustment of tax work, some regions have relaxed this work, and there has been a phenomenon of arbitrarily transferring tax cadres. This must be changed. In the future, tax cadres should continue to be strengthened according to the tax situation, and cadres should be adjusted and used with emphasis. Tax cadres should be specialized and should not be transferred easily. The traditional ideological remnants of some cadres that despise tax work must continue to be eliminated. The professional knowledge of tax cadres must be strengthened and improved. The losses caused by the lack of professional knowledge of tax cadres are very large. In addition to the Central Taxation School and the Taxation Branch Schools in various regions, which have specially trained tax cadres, provinces (cities) must carry out various training and learning activities to improve the professional level of tax cadres. As for the style of tax cadres, it should also be put on the right track. Before the rectification campaign, some tax cadres had a serious commandist style. This has greatly changed in the rectification movement. However, some cadres have also developed a bias of being afraid to boldly adhere to policies and must be corrected.

    The country's tax work in 1950 has achieved remarkable results. These achievements must be consolidated and expanded in 1951 to meet new tasks. After the promulgation of the new tax law, tax work has a clearer standard, and therefore, it is possible to strive for greater achievements. Party and government leading organs at all levels, all tax cadres, and people in the industrial and commercial sectors have the responsibility to further advance tax work in accordance with the provisions of the new tax law.

### 拥护新税法、迎接新任务

    拥护新税法、迎接新任务
    一九五一年的税收工作所担负的政治和经济任务是很重大的。因为我们的国家正处在美帝国主义所发动的侵略战争的威胁之下，不但国防建设急需增强，稳定金融物价的努力，也不容稍有疏忽。在这种情况下，保证税收任务的完成，以巩固财政收支的平衡，是十分重大的任务。
    保证税收工作能够顺利进行的一个重要条件，在于制订与执行全国统一的税法。税法不统一，在税务负担上，必然发生畸轻畸重的不合理的现象。这种现象，不仅影响纳税人对人民政府的观感，而且在一定程度上可以影响社会经济生活的正常状况。因此，平衡全国纳税人纳税负担，是我们人民民主国家税收政策中最基本的原则之一。
    中央人民政府政务院最近适时地分别公布了几个重要的税法，计有：工商业税暂行条例、货物税暂行条例、利息所得税暂行条例、印花税暂行条例、屠宰税暂行条例、工商业税民主评议委员会组织通则、税务复议委员会组织通则。这些税法的公布，是国家财政工作中一件大事。
    上述这些新税法的主要内容，是根据今年六月间有全国工商界代表参加的第二届全国税务会议所决定的修订意见，并经人民政协全国委员会第二届全体会议讨论通过的。其中可以提前实行的部分，已由政务院财政经济委员会于六月二十九日发布通知，规定自七月一日起在全国实行了。这些税法虽然还不能认为就是我们新民主主义国家最完备的税法，其中某些部分还带有过渡的性质，但它是依据当前国家财政经济实际情况，根据共同纲领第四十条关于税收工作所规定的原则，并总结了一年来税收工作经验来制订的。毫无疑问，它是目前可能制订的最好的税法。
    新税法公布之后，最重要的问题，是如何坚决地加以执行。执行新税法时，应当注意与解决那些问题呢？
    第一，必须贯彻统一的税法。一年来各地税收机关在遵守中央关于税务的法令方面，基本上是很好的。各地税收工作人员一般均能任劳任怨，完成了中央所规定的税收任务，并一般地掌握了公私兼顾的正确方针，照顾了工商界的实际困难。但是，个别地方的税收机关在执行中是有缺点的。这些缺点，例如强调地方的特殊性，未经中央批准，即自行颁布税则、税目、税率；越权解释税法，自行决定征免标准；对税法规定的征收方法，不肯认真执行等。这些违反税政税法统一原则的作法，除予人民政府的政治威信以不良影响外，对于社会经济和税收的本身，也有不利影响。所有这些都是应该加以纠正的。
    其次，工商界应协助执行新税法。半年来的事实表明，全国大多数正当的工商业者对调整税收的政策是热烈拥护的，工商界所履行的纳税义务，对国家的贡献也是很大的。但是各地仍有部分工商业户对纳税义务缺乏正确的认识，片面强调自己的困难，而不照顾国家的困难。因而，在纳税时，有协商十余次而无结果的民主评议；也有造假账及采取其他种种方法逃税的，因而在某些较大城市工商户的纳税负担上，在纠正了畸重的偏向之后，畸轻的现象又比较普遍地发生了；某些地方拖欠税款的现象，还相当严重。毫无疑问，这种现象对于国家的税收，是很不利的。因此，上述这些地方的税收工作，必须加以整顿。对逃税欠税的行为应予以坚决的有效的纠正。在这里必须着重指出：税收工作不仅应该作到“依率计征”，而且应该作到“按期缴库”。一方面要保护守法纳税的正当工商业者，另一方面也要处分一些违法偷漏或欠税抗税的分子，以期作到纳税人负担的平衡与合理。
    第三，任务与政策不能统一的错误观点，应乘此新税法公布的机会，在税务干部中进行一次普遍的教育，彻底地加以克服。税法表示人民政府的税收政策，税法的决定，是以能完成国家所需要的税收任务为基础的。认真地执行了税法，即基本上可以完成任务。认为顾了政策，就顾不了任务的说法，是没有真正了解制订政策的基础。另外有些同志却只重视任务，不重视政策。他们说：“死任务，活政策。”他们坚决完成任务的动机虽是正确的，但是他们不重视政策并将任务与政策对立起来的观点，却是错误的。因为政策是党和政府联系群众实现任务的轨道，不按政策办事，必然脱离群众，必然不能正确地完成任务。
    第四，为了保证新税法能贯彻执行，各地领导机关对于税务干部的状况，应加以注意。这是保证税收的一个主要环节。各地党政领导机关在今年三月中央发布统一财政经济工作的决定之后，在这一方面有很大成绩。但在个别地方仍有贯彻不够的现象。特别在调整税收工作之后，有些地方就放松了这一工作，且有将税收干部随意调走的现象。这是必须改变的。今后，应按税收情况，继续增强税收干部，并有重点地调整使用干部。税收干部应当专业化，不应轻易调动。某些干部思想中传统的轻视税收工作的思想残余，必须继续加以肃清。税务干部的业务知识必须注意加强与提高。由于税务干部业务知识不够所造成的损失是很大的。除中央税务学校和各区税务分校，已专门培养税务干部外，各省（市）必须展开各种训练和学习工作，以提高税务干部的业务水平。至于税务干部的作风，也应使之走入正轨。在整风之前，有些税收干部有严重的强迫命令作风。这一点，在整风运动中，已大有转变。但有些干部又因此产生束手束脚不敢大胆坚持政策的偏向，亦须加以纠正。
    一九五○年的国家的税收工作，曾经得到显著的成绩。这些成绩，必须在一九五一年加以巩固和扩大，以迎接新的任务。新税法公布之后，税收工作已有了更明确的标准，因而也就有争取更大成绩的可能。各级党政领导机关、全体税收干部和工商界人士，都有责任依照新税法的规定，将税收工作向前推进一步。
