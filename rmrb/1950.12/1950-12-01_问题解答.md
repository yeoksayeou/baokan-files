    Question and Answer
    Question: I have some questions about the "Economic" supplement of the People's Daily, No. 65 (October 27, 1950), which I don't understand. I would be grateful if you could help me answer them:
    1.  What is the specific calculation method for the coal seam recovery rate? How many factors are there? Is there a recovery rate for open-pit mining?
    2.  The daily coal production per worker is 0.54 tons. Does "daily" mean 24 hours of continuous work, or 8 hours of work, or is there a specific time? The average efficiency of all employees in Hegang has reached 0.842 tons. How should the term "all employees" be understood? Are people who do not directly engage in coal mining work included in the calculation? Is it the same calculation method as the "per worker" mentioned above? Mi Hanzhang of Huainan Mine produced 34 tons in five hours. Is there any other factor that accounts for the difference of dozens of times compared with the above two new records? Are the three new records all for manual coal mining, or are they using machines or semi-machines? Does China currently use machines for coal mining in mines?
    3.  The average power generation output of power plant equipment has increased from 65% to 78.8%. The Shijingshan Fengshan plants have even reached 100%. How is the average power generation output calculated? What does "output" mean? Is 100% the peak?
    4.  The coal consumption rate has been reduced from 1.039 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour to 0.898 kg. The Tangshan plant has even reduced it to 0.577 kg. Is there any relationship between the coal consumption rate and the heating power of the coal quality? Are the above two ratios based on the same coal quality?
    5.  The Soviet Union's national electricity prices are divided into nine categories, but there is no government agency. Is it included in a certain category? Or is it free of charge?
    6.  What conditions determine whether to use a block rate for electricity metering, either increasing or decreasing, as the resulting charges can vary greatly?

    Jiang Shusheng answers:
    (1) The formula for calculating the recovery rate of thick coal seams is:
    Recovery rate = (Amount of coal extracted from the entire layer in the area / Amount of coal buried in the entire layer in the area) × 100
    The key to determining the level of the recovery rate is the coal mining method, and the choice of coal mining method depends on the following geological conditions:
    1. The condition of the roof and floor; 2. The thickness of the coal seam; 3. The hardness of the coal quality; 4. The angle of inclination of the coal seam. The recovery rate also applies to open-pit mining.
    (2) 1. The so-called "daily coal production per worker of 0.54 tons" means the average daily output per worker (calculated on an eight-hour basis), that is, each worker can produce 0.54 tons of coal during their eight-hour workday. This is the current average production efficiency of all employees in coal mines in Northeast and North China, and it is an average figure that includes mechanical coal mining, semi-mechanical coal mining, and manual coal mining.
    2. The average efficiency of all employees in Hegang. The so-called "all employees" refers to all workers and staff of the Mining Bureau (including coal miners, transportation workers, other underground workers, surface workers, management personnel, and other non-directly productive workers, but excluding employees engaged in basic construction and those who have left production). The calculation method is as follows: coal miners and other underground workers are counted as one worker for every eight hours of work, while surface workers and staff are counted based on the number of people who attend work (regardless of whether the attendance time is eight hours, nine hours, or ten hours, it is counted as one worker).
    3. Mi Hanzhang of Huainan produced 34 tons in five hours. This refers to Mi Hanzhang's personal coal mining record using a pneumatic drill as a production tool for five hours. It is neither the efficiency of the coal mining site nor the efficiency of all employees.
    4. "Mechanical coal mining" refers to coal mining work that uses pneumatic picks, pneumatic drills, electric drills for drilling, blasting, coal cutting machines, and electrical current. Some of the mines in Northeast China and a small part of the mines in North and East China are entirely mechanical coal mining, while the rest of the mines mostly use semi-mechanical coal mining and manual coal mining.
    (3) 1. Average power generation output % = (Sum of possible output of power plants / Sum of equipment capacity of power plants) × 100
    2. "Output" is the abbreviation of "possible output," which is the maximum power generation capacity of a power plant. During the period when power plants were under the jurisdiction of bureaucratic institutions in the past, they were not good at operation and maintenance and did not pay attention to maintenance, so that the power generation capacity of most power plants could not reach the nameplate capacity (ie, equipment capacity), and many had large differences. (Under normal circumstances, the possible output should be equal to the equipment capacity).
    3. 100% is the peak. Of course, depending on the design performance of the machine, a certain amount of overload operation for a certain short period of time is still possible.
    (4) The coal consumption rate mentioned refers to the standard coal consumption rate, which is to convert all coals with different calorific values into 7,000 kilocalories.
    (5) The Soviet government agencies are required to pay for electricity. The electricity price is classified into the fifth category. In addition, the electricity prices for hospitals, military camps, etc. are the same as those for government agencies. There is no way to use electricity for free in the Soviet Union.
    (6) Whether to use a block rate system for electricity metering, either increasing or decreasing, should be determined based on the local power supply situation and whether users are encouraged to use more or less electricity. In general, a decreasing block rate is used to promote electricity use and reduce costs. For example, for industrial electricity, if it is necessary to encourage more use and stimulate production, a decreasing block rate can be used. However, under certain special circumstances, such as insufficient power, restrictions on electricity use, and avoidance of waste, an increasing block rate can be used to restrict use.

    问题解答
    问：人民日报“经济”专刊第六十五期（一九五○年十月二十七日）上，我有下列几个问题不懂，请你们帮助我解答为感：
    一、原煤层回收率，具体的计算方法怎样？有几个因数？露天掘有无回收率？
    二、每工每日产煤○·五四吨，所谓每日，是二十四时连续工作还是八小时的工作，还是有特定时间？鹤岗全员平均效率已达○·八四二吨，全员一词怎讲，是否非直接采煤工作的人都计算在内，与上述每工是否同一计算方法？淮南矿米汉章五小时生产三十四吨，与上述两个新纪录相差几十倍，有无其他不同的因素？三个新纪录是否都是人工采煤，还是用机器或半机器的？现在中国有无在矿井中用机器采煤的？
    三、电厂设备平均发电出力由百分之六五提高至百分之七八·八，石景山凤山并达百分之一百，平均发电出力怎样计算？出力一词怎讲？百分之一百是否为顶点？
    四、煤耗率由每电度用煤一·○三九公斤，降低到○·八九八公斤，唐山厂并减到○·五七七公斤，煤耗率与煤质的火力有无关系？上述二个比率是否同一煤质？
    五、苏联全国电灯电价列举分九类，其中并无政府机关是否并入某类某目？还是不纳费？
    六、电度计费采块量式，递增递减都可用，结果计费悬殊，两式根据何种条件来决定？蒋树森答：（一）厚煤层回收率计算的公式是
    回收率＝（区域全层采出煤量／区域全层埋藏量）×１００
    决定回收率高低，主要的是采煤方法，而采煤方法的选择又决定于以下若干地质条件：
    １、顶板底板的良好情形；２、煤层的厚度；３、煤质的软硬；４、煤层倾斜角度。回收率对于露天掘来讲，也是不例外的。
    （二）１、所谓每工每日产煤○·五四吨，就是每工每日（按八小时计算）的平均产量，也就是说每工在他八小时工作时间内可以产煤○·五四吨。这是目前东北、华北各煤矿的全员平均生产效率，是包括机械采煤，半机械采煤和人工采煤三种的平均数字。
    ２、鹤冈的全员平均效率，所谓“全员”是指包括矿务局全体工人职员而言（这其中包括有采煤工、运搬工、其他井下工、地面工、管理人员及其他非直接生产的工作员工而言，但进行基本建设和脱离生产的员工则除外）。它的计算方法，采煤工及其他井下工按八小时为一工，地面工职员则按其出勤人数计算（无论出勤时间为八小时，九小时或十小时均按一工计算）。
    ３、淮南米汉章五小时生产三十四吨，这里所指是米汉章个人使用风镐为生产工具五小时的采煤纪录，既非采煤场子的效率，也不是全员的效率。
    ４、所谓机械采煤，是指用风镐、风钻、电钻，打眼、放炮、割煤机及电流子，通过这些程序进行采煤的工作就是机械采煤。东北各矿的一部分及华北华东各矿的一小部分全是机械采煤，其余各矿大部分还是半机械采煤及人工采煤。
    （三）１、平均发电出力％＝（发电厂可能出力之和／发电厂设备容量之和）×１００
    ２、出力即可能出力之简称，亦即发电厂最大发电能力。发电厂在以往官僚机构管辖时期，不善于运行和维护，更不重视检修，以致大多数电厂的发电能力达不到铭牌容量（即设备容量），且有不少相差很多的。（在正常情况下，可能出力应与设备容量相等）。
    ３、百分之一百是顶点。当然，随机器设计性能之不同，一定短时间一定数量之超负荷运转还是可能的。
    （四）所称煤耗率均指标准煤耗率，即将所有不同含热量的煤换算成七千大卡。
    （五）苏联政府机关的用电，是规定要纳费的。电价是归入第五类。此外还有医院，军营等的电价，亦和政府机关的相同。在苏联是没有免费用电的办法的。
    （六）电度计费采块量式，是递增或递减，应根据当地供电情况，对于用户用电是鼓励多用还是提倡少用，对多用予以限制而决定的。普通为了推广用电，减低成本，一般的是采用块量递减式；例如对于工业用电，如须鼓励多用，刺激生产，可采用块量递减式。但在某种特殊情形下，如电力不足，限制用电，避免浪费等原因，可采用块量递增式，以资限制。
