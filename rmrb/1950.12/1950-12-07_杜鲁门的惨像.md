These days, the White House is in an uproar,
    With lights burning brightly all night long,
    Truman purses his thin lips,
    Shivering and feverish, as if seriously ill.

    His speech was never clear to begin with,
    But in his anxiety, he stutters even more, his eyes gleaming,
    He touches his glasses and wipes his sweat,
    His chest feels like a donkey is kicking around inside.

    He holds the "War Report" with trembling hands,
    He must look at it, but looking makes him even more frantic:
    The "tiger's jaws" were clearly in his own hands,
    How did they reverse direction in the blink of an eye?!

    He had good dreams a few days ago,
    Dreaming of standing on the bridge abutment at the Yalu River,
    The river was frozen, a beautiful scene,
    And MacArthur leaned beside him, puffing on his pipe.

    Happily cutting the ribbon for a good show,
    The second move was aimed directly at Shenyang;
    Who knew the "general offensive" would turn into a massive beating,
    And he's already seeing coffins being carried back to his homeland.

    "Outrageous! Outrageous!"
    The more Truman thought, the more heartbroken he became,
    Glaring, he dismissed the attendants,
    He wanted to close his eyes and calm himself.

    But he couldn't calm down! His belly full of anger,
    His face was similar to eggplant skin,
    "Someone come!" he shouted,
    "Who asked you to come in?" And he slammed the door shut again.

    "Quickly, summon the news reporters,
    I want to have a good talk with them."
    Truman had long lost his usual composure,
    He grabbed this and that in a flustered manner.

    Sure enough, a large group of reporters arrived,
    Countless "cameras" flashed with magnesium lights,
    Truman wiped his sweat with a soaking handkerchief,
    And began to chatter:

    "I want to have it out with the Chinese Communists, I want to cross the border,
    The US government's mission in Korea will never change,
    I also have the atomic bomb...
    Oh! Peace is my proposition!"

    He played the old tune again and again,
    He sang this old opera again and again,
    The rotten salted fish long ago lost its freshness,
    With a wave of his hand, the press conference ended.

    Atomic bomb! Atomic bomb!
    My heart, my treasure, my dear mother!
    Disaster is imminent, you must save my old life!
    Truman thought, biting his nails.

    He sat in the White House waiting for "reactions,"
    The Western European representatives shook their heads first, a real blow to the head,
    A cloud of sorrow covered his face,
    The veins on his forehead were thicker than earthworms!

    Don't mention the consequences of the president's "statement,"
    Mentioning it is like a steel knife twisting in the gut:
    Someone in London said I was a madman,
    French parliamentarians also said I was like an adventurer;

    "To hell with you! Bastards!
    You're simply forcing me to jump over the wall!"
    What, are American soldiers in Korea still retreating?
    My intimidation is just a piece of toilet paper?

    Oh! It doesn't work, it doesn't work,
    Why has my trump card become like this?
    Truman slumped in a large chair,
    Like a fool, tears welling up in his eyes...

    Another large package of letters written by the American people was delivered,
    And thousands of telegrams piled up on his desk,
    Truman was even more clueless,
    He only felt his fingertips tingling and his head swelling!

    "Those who want peace actually come to me,
    Ridiculous! Fucking ridiculous!"
    He grabbed a telegram and threw it into the air,
    The whole room was full of paper butterflies fluttering.

    His heart rate did not stop,
    His tongue also stiffened.
    Hesitantly opening the curtains,
    He was really afraid that protesting crowds would come to settle accounts with him.

    He walked back and forth non-stop,
    The fire in his heart burned hotter and hotter,
    One moment he called Marshall,
    The next moment he sought Acheson to discuss.

    Quickly call Austin back,
    The voting machine in the United Nations must be checked properly;
    Britain actually said not to clash head-on with China,
    Alas! Let Attlee come to Washington for a visit.

    What are you still arguing about? What time is it?
    Isn't it digging out my back wall?
    He hated the British and French criticism of MacArthur,
    But MacArthur's defeat also made his eyes red with crying.

    Truman suddenly couldn't see anything,
    Only then did he realize his glasses had slipped to the tip of his nose,
    Thinking of the Western European lads complaining to him,
    He only felt very lonely, with no one to help!

    Bite the bullet and keep going!
    Whoever opposes me, I'll put a red hat on him,
    No more talk about American soldiers going home for Christmas,
    Whoever says it is a Communist!

    Military spending must be increased, and increased again!
    With dollars, anything is easy to say,
    You Western European guys dare to disobey,
    The "Marshall Plan" is your nurturing mother.

    If we have to take care of Korea, we can't take care of Europe,
    Truman painfully became a crippled wolf,
    The "recruitment station" report also said no one was signing up,
    Truman's belly was as swollen as a drum with anger.

    The late night in Washington seemed very desolate,
    It was snowing, and the White House had become a cemetery,
    Truman only felt pain in his muscles and bones,
    As if his buttocks were sitting on the tip of a knife.

    The entire office was spinning,
    His ears were ringing,
    Another brilliant "war report" was delivered,
    Lost Pyongyang, lost Pyongyang!

    What to do? What, what to do?
    Truman knelt down and shouted:
    "God! Only you can help! Amen!"
    He hunched his neck, looking like a dung beetle!

### 杜鲁门的惨像

    杜鲁门的惨像
    沙鸥诗
    方成画
    这几天白宫内闹嚷嚷，
    大小电灯都通宵明亮，
    杜鲁门噘着他的瘪嘴，
    发冷发热的像害大病一样。
    他的口齿本来不清楚，
    一着急更结结巴巴，眼里冒金光，
    他摸了摸眼镜又擦了擦汗，
    胸口里像有条毛驴儿在乱撞。
    他拿着《战报》双手发抖，
    不看也不成，看了更慌：
    明明“虎头钳”是在他自己手中，
    怎的一转眼就变了方向！？
    前些日子也曾作过好梦，
    梦见他站在鸭绿江边的桥墩上，
    江水结了冰，好一片风景，
    麦克也叨着烟斗靠在他身旁。
    兴高采烈地给一幕好戏剪了彩，
    第二步棋正是指向沈阳；
    那知“总攻势”成了大挨揍，
    眼看着就要抬起棺木回家乡。
    “岂有此理！岂有此理！”
    杜鲁门越想越心伤，
    瞪着大眼轰走了侍从官员，
    他要一个人闭目来静养。
    静不下来呀！一肚子邪火，
    他的脸色与茄子皮很相仿，
    “来人哪！”他一声大喊，
    “谁要你进来？”他又把门关上。
    “快把新闻记者给我喊来，
    我要跟他们好好讲一讲。”
    杜鲁门早已失去了平常的镇静，
    他东抓一下西抓一把地十分张惶。
    记者果然来了一大群，
    无数的“卡麦拉”嚓嚓地闪着镁光，
    杜鲁门用湿透了的手绢擦汗，
    叽叽喳喳地开了场：
    “我要向中共摊牌，我要越过边界，
    美国政府对朝鲜的使命决不改样，
    我还有原子弹呢………
    哟哟！和平是我的主张！”
    老调子他弹了又弹，
    这出旧戏他唱了又唱，
    腐烂的咸鱼早就没有新鲜味，
    手一挥，记者招待会就此散场。
    原子弹哟！原子弹！
    心肝，宝贝，我的亲娘！
    大难临头，你要救我的老命哟！
    杜鲁门咬着指甲这样想。
    他坐在白宫等“反应”，
    西欧代表先摇头，真是当头一棒，
    一片愁云盖上了他的脸，
    额角的青筋比蚯蚓还壮！
    不要提起总统“声明”的后果吧，
    一提起就像钢刀绞肚肠：
    伦敦有人说我是个疯子，
    法国的议员也说我跟冒险家一样；
    “去你的！浑蛋东西！
    简直是逼我去跳墙！”
    怎么，朝鲜的美国兵还在败退？
    我的恫吓只算是大便纸一张？
    哎哟！不灵了，不灵了，
    我的王牌怎么成这个样？
    杜鲁门瘫在一把大椅子里，
    像个傻小子，眼泪汪汪。……
    美国人民写的信又送来一大包，
    还有上千封的电报堆在办公桌上，
    杜鲁门更没了主意，
    只觉得指尖发麻，脑壳发胀！
    “要和平的竟来找我，
    荒唐！真他妈的荒唐！”
    他抓起电报就向空中一甩，
    满屋里全是纸蝴蝶在飞扬。
    他的心跳并没有停止，
    他的舌头也发了僵。
    缩手缩脚地掀开了窗帘，
    真怕有示威的群众来找他算账。
    他又马不停蹄地走来走去，
    心中的肝火越烧越旺，
    一会打电话给马歇尔，
    一会又找艾奇逊来商量。
    快把奥斯汀喊回来，
    放在联合国的表决机器要检查妥当；
    英国竟说出不要向中国硬碰，
    唉！让艾德礼快来华盛顿一趟。
    还吵些什么呢？啥时候了？
    岂不是在挖我的后墙？
    他讨厌英法对麦克的责难，
    但麦克的败绩又使他哭红了眼眶。
    杜鲁门忽然什么也瞧不见了，
    才发觉他的眼镜已滑在鼻尖上，
    一想起西欧的小伙计们对他抱怨，
    只觉得他很孤单，没人帮忙！
    咬紧牙根干下去吧！
    谁来反对我就给他把红帽子扣上，
    不准再说美国兵要在圣诞节回家，
    谁说了谁就是共产党！
    军费要加多，还要加多！
    有了美元什么话都好讲，
    你西欧的家伙们敢不听话，
    “马歇尔计划”就是你们的养身娘。
    要顾到朝鲜就顾不得欧洲了，
    杜鲁门痛心作了缺腿狼，
    “征兵站”的报告又说无人上门，
    杜鲁门的肚子气得像鼓一样。
    华盛顿的深夜显得很凄凉，
    下雪了，白宫变成了一座坟场，
    杜鲁门只感到筋骨疼痛，
    好像他的屁股是坐在刀尖上。
    整个办公室都在旋转，
    他的两耳嗡嗡作响，
    精彩的“战报”又送进门来，
    丢了平壤，丢了平壤！
    这怎么办？这，怎么办？
    杜鲁门双脚跪下乱叫嚷：
    “上帝！只有靠你了！阿门！”
    他缩着脖子，活像一个屎克螂！
                  五○、十二、六日
