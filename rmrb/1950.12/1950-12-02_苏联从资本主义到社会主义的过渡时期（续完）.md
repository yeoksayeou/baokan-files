    The pace of industrialization, the Soviet method of state industrialization, and the sources of funding for establishing heavy industry.

    The task at that time was to implement socialist industrialization in the shortest historical period, and the domestic and international environment as a whole demanded that industrialization must proceed at the fastest possible speed.

    Comrade Stalin, in February 1931, when explaining the historical necessity of high-speed development, said: "We are fifty to a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must cover this distance within ten years. Either we do this, or we will be crushed by our enemies." Only with the help of the Soviet method of industrialization discovered by Comrade Stalin, relying on its advantages over the capitalist method of industrialization, could our country be transformed into an industrial nation in a short historical period.

    "The Soviet method of state industrialization is fundamentally different from the capitalist method of industrialization. In capitalist countries, industrialization usually begins with light industry. Because light industry requires less investment than heavy industry, capital turns over faster, and profits are easier to obtain, light industry becomes the primary object of industrialization there. Only after a long period, when light industry has accumulated some profits and concentrated them in banks, will it be the turn of heavy industry to gradually transfer the accumulated capital to heavy industry, creating the conditions to guarantee its development. But this is a long process, requiring decades of waiting for light industry to develop, and struggling along without heavy industry. The Communist Party certainly cannot take this path. The Party knows that war is approaching, and without heavy industry, it will be impossible to defend the country. Therefore, it is necessary to start developing heavy industry quickly. If this matter is delayed even slightly, it will be equivalent to failure. The Party remembered Lenin's instructions: Without heavy industry, it is impossible to maintain the independence of the country; without heavy industry, the Soviet system will perish. Therefore, our Communist Party rejected the 'usual' path of industrialization and began state industrialization by developing heavy industry. This was an extremely difficult task, but this difficulty could be overcome. In this regard, the nationalization of industry and banks greatly helped us, enabling us to quickly gather huge amounts of funds and transfer them to heavy industry.

    "Without a doubt, if we had not done this, we would not have been able to transform our country into an industrial nation in such a short period" (Stalin's speech at the voters' meeting of the Stalin constituency in Moscow on February 9, 1946).

    It is very difficult to implement industrialization in a large country in a very short historical period. Constructing many large heavy industrial enterprises at the same time requires the investment of huge amounts of funds. The construction of modern large-scale industries usually takes several years. During these years, a lot of capital is invested, and beneficial results can only be obtained after the new enterprises start operation. Therefore, industrialization requires a large amount of capital to be drawn from the national economy for a long time.

    In the industrialization of capitalist countries, in addition to the ruthless exploitation of "domestic" workers and peasants, the inflow of foreign capital also played a major role. Comrade Stalin, in summarizing the historical experience of industrial development in capitalist countries, pointed out three methods of industrialization: relying on the plunder of colonies (Britain), relying on war reparations (Germany), and relying on enslaving loans and concessions (Tsarist Russia). For the Soviet Union, these methods of industrialization and methods of mobilizing funds for industrial construction were abandoned from the beginning. Comrade Stalin, based on an assessment of the advantages of the socialist economic system, discovered a new path of industrialization that relied on its own resources and on planned socialist accumulation.

    Since industry, transportation, land, and banks are all the property of the Soviet state, the wealth created by workers and peasants is not used to satisfy the parasitic desires of the bourgeoisie, but to meet the needs of socialist industrial development. Secondly, the Soviet regime freed the national economy from paying hundreds of millions of rubles in interest on Tsarist debts annually. Peasants were freed from paying rent to landlords (about 500 million rubles per year) and from heavy debts to banks. Peasants, whose interests were related to industrial prosperity, were able to use part of their funds for this purpose. The Soviet state carried out continuous struggles to increase labor productivity and reduce costs, strictly adhered to a system of frugality in expenditures, and improved labor discipline.

    All these sources of internal accumulation supplied us with hundreds of millions of rubles. The Soviet regime invested the funds accumulated in this way into state industrialization. Thus, the most difficult task in industrialization—accumulating funds to establish heavy industry—was solved.

    The implementation of Soviet industrialization only truly unfolded from the first year (1928-1929) of the First Stalin Five-Year Plan. The total investment in the First Five-Year Plan was 51 billion rubles, and in the Second Five-Year Plan, it was 137.5 billion rubles. Most of these funds were used to develop industry and transportation.

    All this enabled the Soviet Union to create socialist productive forces on a large scale in a very short period of time. Hundreds of new factories with first-class modern equipment appeared in the country, and old factories were renovated and equipped with new technologies.

    In addition to adopting new technologies, a large number of new cadres with the necessary production experience and technical skills were needed. The shortage of cadres who had mastered new technologies was one of the most serious obstacles to the smooth development of industry. Therefore, a most serious task was to train cadres for newly built industrial enterprises. These tasks were successfully solved. Millions of working people filled with genuine construction enthusiasm overcame countless obstacles and widely unfolded socialist competition. The new industrial construction reached an unprecedented scale.

    The Soviet Union transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial power

    During the years of several Stalin Five-Year Plans, thousands upon thousands of new factories equipped with the latest technology were built and put into operation.

    Among these factories were dozens of giant socialist enterprises, in whose construction the whole country participated. These were the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk metallurgical plants, the Dnepr Hydroelectric Station, the automobile factories in Moscow and Gorky, the tractor factories in Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk, the agricultural machinery factory in Rostov, combine factories, large lathe manufacturing plants, the ball bearing factory in Moscow, the Stalin, Soligamen and Berezniki chemical combines, and many other enterprises. In addition, thousands of enterprises were renovated on a new technical basis.

    Dozens of new industrial sectors that did not exist in pre-revolutionary Russia were established.

    Socialist industry grew into the decisive force of the Soviet national economy. The total industrial output greatly increased. The Dnepr Hydroelectric Station alone, by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, produced more electricity than all the power plants in Tsarist Russia combined. Three giant ferrous metallurgy plants—Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, and Makeyev—produced more pig iron than the entire ferrous metallurgy industry of Tsarist Russia.

    In the shortest historical period—thirteen years—the Soviet Union traversed the road that developed capitalist countries had taken about ten times as long to complete. The Soviet Union transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial power. In terms of total industrial output, Tsarist Russia ranked fourth in Europe and fifth in the world. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union stood first in Europe and second in the world (second only to the United States).

    The Soviet Union became an economically independent country, satisfying the growing needs of the economy and defense with all the necessary technical equipment. Thus, socialist industrialization guaranteed our motherland's economic independence and laid a solid foundation for our motherland's military and economic power.

    In 1913, in the total output of large-scale industry and agriculture, industry accounted for 42.1 percent and agriculture accounted for 57.9 percent; in 1937, industry accounted for 77.4 percent, while agriculture accounted for only 17.9 percent. According to the 1926 population census, the urban population accounted for 17.9 percent and the rural population accounted for 82.1 percent; according to the 1936 population census, the urban population accounted for 32.8 percent and the agricultural population accounted for 67.2 percent. The number of workers and staff members increased from 11.4 million in 1913 to 27 million in 1937 and 30.4 million in 1940.

    Tsarist Russia imported more than two-fifths of the machines used in industry, transportation, and other sectors of the national economy. As for industry, the foreign machines it was equipped with accounted for nearly two-thirds, and the textile industry even accounted for three-quarters. On the eve of the Second Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, imports accounted for about one-third of the country's machines. In 1932, imported machines accounted for less than 13 percent, and in 1937, they were only 0.9 percent. Thus, the machine panic that had long hindered our country's development was a thing of the past, and the Soviet Union freed itself from dependence on capitalist countries, guaranteeing economic independence.

    Lenin's Cooperative Plan

    In the construction of a socialist society, the task of socialist transformation of agriculture occupies a special position.

    Even in the most developed capitalist countries, agriculture is still the most backward sector of the national economy, with small-scale farming accounting for a large proportion. Under the capitalist system, peasants are a class of small producers who are subjected to the brutal exploitation of landlords, rich peasants, merchants, speculators, and usurers. The founders of scientific socialism pointed out, and the history of capitalist development has repeatedly proven, that under the conditions of bourgeois society, the basic masses of independent peasants are destined to go bankrupt and become impoverished.

    After the working class seizes power, they will inevitably face the task of solving this centuries-old peasant problem. Marxism-Leninism has solved the peasant problem in the only correct way.

    As a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution, extremely enormous changes took place in the class structure of the countryside. The Soviet peasantry was liberated from the historical exploiters, the landlords. The rich peasants were also greatly weakened. The Soviet peasantry obtained enormous material fruits.

    In the early years of the Soviet regime, the countryside was gradually becoming middle-peasantized. After most poor peasants obtained land, they all rose to the level of middle peasants with the help of the Soviet regime. Therefore, the number of middle peasants did not decline as it did under capitalism, but increased. The middle peasant became the central figure in agriculture. At the same time, the agricultural capitalist class—the rich peasants—still had considerable power.

    The task of the working class with regard to the laboring masses of peasants is to guide them from the path of individual peasant economy to the path of large-scale socialist agriculture, thereby absorbing them into socialist construction. Comrade Stalin said: "The main thing is to build socialism together with the peasants, we must build it together with the peasants, and we must do so under the leadership of the working class, because the leadership of the working class is the fundamental guarantee that this construction will advance along the socialist road."

    Before the Soviet regime, there was only one historical path to establish large-scale agricultural production. That was the capitalist road, which was associated with the bankruptcy and demise of many small economies, and with the countless disasters and hardships of the broad masses of peasants.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up a new, socialist path of agricultural development prescribed by Lenin and Stalin. Comrade Stalin said in February 1946: "In order to eliminate the backwardness of our agriculture and to supply the country with more grain, cotton, etc., it is necessary to transition from small-scale farming to large-scale agriculture, because only large-scale agriculture can adopt new technologies, utilize all agricultural achievements, and produce more marketable agricultural products. But there are two types of large-scale agriculture: one is capitalist agriculture; the other is collective agriculture. The Communist Party can never take the capitalist road of agricultural development, not only because of reasons of principle, but also because this road requires an excessively long development process and presupposes the bankruptcy of the peasants, turning them into hired laborers. Therefore, the Communist Party has taken the road of agricultural collectivization, the road of uniting the various peasant households into collective farms, thereby consolidating the agricultural economy. The method of collectivization is the most progressive method, not only because it does not require the bankruptcy of the peasants, but especially because it enables us to fill the country with large-scale collective farms within a few years that can adopt new technologies, utilize all agricultural achievements, and supply the country with more marketable agricultural products.

    "Without a doubt, if we had not implemented the policy of collectivization, we would not have been able to eliminate the historical backwardness of our agriculture in such a short period of time."

    The cooperative plan for absorbing peasants into the socialist construction cause was proposed by Lenin as early as the beginning of the New Economic Policy. The main points of Lenin's cooperative plan are as follows: to establish a strong industry capable of transforming agriculture; to initially establish the simplest cooperatives in the form of supply and marketing, thereby cultivating the collective habits of peasants; after preparing the necessary conditions, to begin the transition from small private economy to large-scale, public, agricultural labor combination economy. Lenin's cooperative plan believed that under the Soviet regime, cooperatives were precisely the path that millions of peasants could accept and understand, from a scattered individual economy to a large-scale production union—the collective farm. Lenin believed that the basic conditions for this transition were the leadership of the working class over the peasants and the development of large-scale socialist industry, because such industry is the foundation for technically changing agriculture. Under the dictatorship of the working class, the basic means of production are concentrated in the hands of the Soviet regime. At this time, cooperatives become a socialist economic form. Under the dictatorship of the working class, it is precisely the cooperatives that initially rooted the principles of collectivism in the peasants in terms of supply and marketing, and then in production.

    On this point, Lenin called cooperatives a highway to socialism, pointing out that under our conditions, the simple development of cooperatives is equivalent to the development of socialism. Lenin foresaw that cooperatives, an organization uniting the broadest masses of working peasants, were a link by which to solve the task of socialist transformation of the countryside.

    Lenin taught that in order to guide peasants from the path of individual economy to the path of collective economy, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and to convince them that the public collective economy is superior to the individual economy. Lenin's principle of voluntariness refutes any coercive attitude towards the middle peasants. This principle is one of the most important principles in the construction of collective farms.

    Creation of Prerequisites for Comprehensive Collectivization

    The achievements of socialist state industrialization made it possible to practically propose the task of socialist transformation of the countryside. The entire political and economic situation in the country urgently demanded the solution of this task.

    As the recovery period drew to a close, agriculture as a whole had surpassed the pre-war level. However, its main sector—grain production—only reached nine-tenths of pre-war output. And the expansion of industry and the growth of the urban population demanded more grain and raw materials year by year. It was impossible to meet this demand with small-scale production in the countryside. The fragmentation of the peasant economy continued. Small, scattered individual peasant economies had only pitiful tools, so they could not truly increase yields much.

    In 1927, the first year after the recovery period, about 60 percent of the Soviet countryside was made up of middle peasants, 35 percent of poor peasants, and 4 to 5 percent of rich peasants.

    In 1926 and 1927, three-quarters of the grain consumed by cities was obtained from the economies of middle and poor peasants. The economy of the landlords was eliminated. Before the revolution, they provided more than one-fifth of all the grain circulating outside the countryside. The proportion of the rich peasant economy in supplying grain was reduced by half, from one-half to one-fifth.

    However, the small peasant economy sold only slightly more than one-tenth of the total grain produced to the market. Therefore, this economy was of a semi-natural nature, and its commodity rate was very low. Although the total grain produced in the country was only slightly less than in the pre-war period, the amount that came to the market to meet the needs of the growing industrial population was two-thirds less than the pre-war amount. This is where the grain crisis manifested itself, and this crisis also posed a danger of causing a livestock crisis.

    The grain crisis showed that large-scale socialist industry could not develop smoothly in parallel with the small peasant economy. If this contradiction was maintained, it would endanger the entire national economy with collapse.

    The middle-peasantization of the countryside, the increase in the number of peasant households, and the semi-natural nature of the rural economy meant that the countryside was supplying fewer and fewer workers to the cities and factories.

    This created a threat that the rapidly growing socialist industry, which constantly demanded a large number of new workers, would not be able to obtain this supply, and thus would have to halt its development speed.

    The only way to solve this most important problem for socialist industry was to implement a technological revolution in agriculture and transition agriculture to socialism.

    At the end of 1927, at the 15th Party Congress, which went down in history as the congress of collectivization, a decision was passed to fully unfold the transition to collective farms based on the proposal of Comrade Stalin.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report at the congress: "The way out lies in uniting the scattered small peasant farms into large farms on the basis of public cultivation, and implementing collective cultivation on the basis of new and higher technologies."

    Socialist state industrialization is the key to implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture. The necessary basis for supplying agriculture with machines and tractors has been established.

    The process of large-scale peasant transformation towards the path of collective farms was prepared by the development of agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives cultivated the preliminary habits of collective management of economic affairs among broader peasant strata.

    The first stage of peasant economic cooperation was the cooperative of marketing agricultural products and supplying means of production and means of consumption (i.e., industrial goods). This form of cooperation had already cultivated the preliminary habits of joint management of economic affairs among broader peasant strata. At this stage, the connection between socialist industry and the peasant economy was mainly of a commercial nature. However, in many cases at this stage, a relatively close mutual relationship between the peasant economy and state industry had already been established. For example, individual types of agricultural cooperatives (such as flax, etc.) united many production groups, supplied them with seeds and production tools, and sold their products to socialist industry, eliminating any intermediate exploitation. This was, as Comrade Stalin said, "the domestic system of large-scale state socialist production in agriculture."

    The collective farm, which transitions to large-scale collective production, is the highest stage of peasant cooperation.

    The process of peasants transitioning to the path of collective farms was also politically prepared. Since the beginning of the October Revolution, the Lenin-Stalin Party has tirelessly carried out political enlightenment work for the peasants in the countryside, raising the cultural level of the peasant masses in all aspects.

    As such, the entire course of economic and political development had prepared the prerequisites for the laboring peasant masses to transition to the path of socialist development.

    Agricultural Collectivization is the Path of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture

    Based on Lenin's cooperative plan, Comrade Stalin comprehensively formulated the theory of agricultural collectivization, and his genius leadership guaranteed the victory of the collective farm system.

    Based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of reproduction, Comrade Stalin pointed out that it was impossible to build the socialist construction cause of the Soviet regime on two different types of social foundations for a long period of time, building it on the foundation of the most massive concentrated socialist industry and the most scattered backward small commodity economy. Large-scale socialist industry, united throughout the country, was developing at an extremely fast speed according to the principles of socialist expanded reproduction, and eliminating capitalist components. At the same time, the scattered, individual small peasant economy was not even able to carry out simple reproduction frequently, and was constantly generating capitalist components. Comrade Stalin pointed out the only correct way out—to consolidate the socialist path of agriculture, the path of building state-owned farms and collective farms.

    Under capitalist conditions, the countryside spontaneously follows the city, and it proceeds entirely according to the economic development laws generated in the city and in capitalist industry. This is because the capitalist economy in the city and the small peasant economy in the countryside are basically the same type of economic form. Both are based on private ownership of the means of production. But one must never conclude from this that the peasant economy is a capitalist economy. However, due to the laws of commodity production and competition, it spontaneously differentiates capitalist components from within itself.

    The development of the peasant economy towards socialism is another matter. This development does not proceed along spontaneous market laws, but against these laws. The countryside itself cannot spontaneously follow the socialist city. Lenin once said that "peasants have commodity-capitalist tendencies," that is, tendencies that run counter to the proletarian socialist tendency. Only the leadership of the working class can guarantee the victory of socialism in the countryside. The Soviet state set up state-owned farms and collective farms, giving them all material support, using the power of demonstration to convince the peasant masses of the superiority of large-scale socialist production, and organized a huge socialist economy in the countryside.

    The first collective farms that did not yet possess agricultural machine tractor stations can be said to be the "handicraft period of collective farm construction." They were based on the simple combination of peasant production tools. Collective production based on this combination of peasants' original means of production voluntarily turned into public ownership had already shown a place far superior to the small-scale individual economy. At the beginning of the collective farm movement, the advantages of large-scale production were most clearly manifested in the expansion of planting area. This expansion came from the cultivation of long-fallow and uncultivated land that was difficult for individual labor to cultivate, the elimination of boundaries and land fragmentation, and so on.

    The advantage of collective farms over individual economies has increased with the technical transformation of agriculture.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out at the beginning of the mass collective farm movement that the basic and main link in collective farm construction is the agricultural labor combination, because, first, the labor combination correctly combines the individual daily life interests of collective farmers with their public interests. Second, the labor combination smoothly adapts the interests of individual daily life to the public interests, thereby easily educating yesterday's individual farmers in a collective spirit. Agricultural machine stations are the mainstay of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the pillar of socialist state help for agriculture and farmers.

    Over many years, the Party and the Soviet state established new technical equipment in the countryside--tractors, complex agricultural machines, and trained cadres who could master this technology. A network of agricultural machine stations was established. These agricultural machine stations were an important tool for the Soviet state to unite the various peasant households into collective farms.

    That is to say, new productive forces were created in the countryside. And the theory of historical materialism teaches us that changes in productive forces will cause changes in production relations. Tractors, complex agricultural machines, and new cadres who have mastered these technologies cannot be used in small-scale individual economies. They require large-scale social production, and that is to say, new production relations between people must be established, and new ways of owning the means of production must be established.

    Therefore, the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union is a law of our country's socialist development. Transitioning to collective farms is in line with the most vital material interests of the broad masses of peasants. The broad masses of peasants have extremely high and warm emotions when they turn to the path of collective farms, make their means of production and their labor public, and create large-scale labor combination economies.

    The Great Transformation of the Peasant Masses Towards Socialism

    The fundamental transformation of peasants towards collective farms began in the second half of 1929. Peasants no longer joined collective farms individually in small groups, but in entire villages, entire townships, entire districts, and even entire states. And this is exactly as Comrade Stalin pointed out, the middle peasants also joined collective farms. This is the foundation of the fundamental transformation in the development of the rural economy, and this fundamental transformation is the most important achievement of the Soviet regime in the past year.

    In the Soviet countryside, the process of comprehensive collectivization began, a process prepared by the entire course of previous development.

    Agricultural collectivization eliminated the capitalist breeding ground in the countryside. This collectivization permanently eliminated the differentiation of peasants and cut off the road for the resurgence of the capitalist economy.

    "This is an extremely profound revolution, a sudden change from the old social state to the new social state, and in terms of results, it is of equal significance to the October Revolution of 1917" (Concise History of the CPSU (B) Chinese text page 375).

    The special feature of this revolution is that it was initiated from above, by the state power, and directly supported from below by millions of peasant masses.

    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that when new productive forces are established and the necessity of abolishing old production relations matures, those advanced ideas and new political systems that should use force to eliminate old production relations gain great power. New social ideas organize and mobilize the masses, and the masses unite into new political armies in order to abolish the old system in production relations and lay the foundation for the new system.

    The experience of revolution tells us that before a revolution occurs in social relations, a revolution in people's consciousness must first occur. People are armed with the ideas of the new social system. The more resolute the revolution in mass consciousness, the more thorough the revolution in social relations.

    Because the Communist Party and the working class have carried out years of persistent political education for the peasants, when the time for the economic necessity of transitioning to collectivization has matured, a profound revolution has taken place in the consciousness of the peasants. The peasant masses realized the necessity of this revolution in their lives and embarked on the path of comprehensive collectivization according to the call of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the Soviet state.

    The Victory and Consolidation of the Collective Farm System in the Countryside

    Collectivization in the Soviet countryside was basically achieved during the First Five-Year Plan. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, in 1932, more than 200,000 collective farms united more than 60 percent of the peasant households. These collective farms owned more than 70 percent of the total planting area of the peasant households.

    Previously, during the period when individual peasant households were dominant, only 500 million to 600 million poods of commodity grain were purchased; now, 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion poods of grain can be purchased annually. The rich peasants have been eliminated as a class, the working peasants have been freed from the enslavement and exploitation of the rich peasants, and a solid economic foundation has been laid for the Soviet regime in the countryside—the foundation of the collective economy.

    By 1938, 18.8 million peasant households, or 93.5 percent of the peasant households, had joined collective farms. The grain planting area of collective farms was 75 million hectares in 1933, and by 1938, it had increased to 92 million hectares. In the individual economic sector, by 1938, it only accounted for 0.6 percent of the total grain planting area, and in terms of technical crops, the role of the individual economy was almost zero. Therefore, Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report at the 18th Party Congress: "The socialist economic system is now the only form of our agriculture."

    The strongest highly mechanized agriculture has now been established in the Soviet Union.

    State-owned farms and agricultural machine stations played the most important role in the socialist transformation of the countryside.

    Agricultural machine stations are a powerful lever for the Soviet regime in promoting the construction of collective farms. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, the number of agricultural machine stations was 2,500, and they supplied 50 percent of the collective farm planting area for use. By 1937, there were 5,800 agricultural machine stations, and these agricultural machine stations supplied 91.2 percent of the collective farm planting area for use. By 1940, there were more than 7,000 agricultural machine stations.

    The several Stalin Five-Year Plans implemented to realize state industrialization and rural collectivization carried out a thorough technical revolution in agriculture.

    There were 8 million plows in the pre-revolutionary countryside. On the eve of the First Five-Year Plan, in 1928, there were still about 4.5 million. Only after the victory of the collective farm system were plows completely driven out of the fields. Now plows can only be seen in museums in the Soviet Union, where they are placed to compare with stone axes.

    In 1924, there were 2,600 tractors in the Soviet Union, totaling 25,600 horsepower. In 1938, there were 484,000 tractors working in the socialist fields, and by 1940, they had increased to 523,000.

    Mechanized harvesters—combine harvesters—were only adopted in large quantities in our agriculture during the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1930, the number of these harvesters totaled 1,700. In 1938, it was 153,000, and by 1940, it had increased to 182,000.

    The use of improved machines—first of all, tractors and combine harvesters—has led agricultural work to broad mechanization. For example, as early as 1928, almost one-tenth of all spring-sown grain land was cultivated with plows, nearly nine-tenths were cultivated with horse-drawn plows, and only 1 percent was cultivated with tractors. By 1938, tractors accounted for three-quarters of the spring-sown land, horse-drawn plows accounted for one-quarter, and plows were nowhere to be seen. In 1932, only one-twenty-fifth of the grain area was harvested with combine harvesters, while by 1938, half of the grain area was harvested with combine harvesters.

    New productive forces and new production relations in the countryside; that is, the socialist mode of production, guarantees the rapid upsurge of agriculture, and guarantees the large-scale increase of agricultural products, especially grain and technical crops.

    Large-scale socialist agriculture has a very high commodity yield. For example, in pre-revolutionary Russia, the commodity yield of grain production was 26 percent, while the commodity yield of grain production in Soviet collective farms and state-owned farms was 40 percent by 1938. Due to the high commodity yield of collective farms and state-owned farms, Soviet agriculture produced 38.3 million tons of commodity grain in 1940, which is 17 million tons more than in 1913. It is precisely because of this characteristic of collective farms and state-owned farms that our country was able to solve the grain problem so easily and quickly, and solved the problem of fully supplying such a large country with commodity grain.

    The socialist transformation of agriculture is one of the most difficult socialist revolutionary tasks after the working class seizes power. In the large-scale industry in the hands of the Soviet state, the socio-economic foundation for technical transformation was basically prepared. In agriculture, the transformation of the extremely backward technical foundation would not be possible without simultaneously transforming the old socio-economic components, without uniting small individual economies into large collective economies, and without completely eradicating the roots of capitalism that remained under the conditions of scattered small production. The enemies of socialism were constantly predicting the "bankruptcy" of this undertaking. The victory of the collective farm system overturned all their hopes for the bankruptcy of socialism.

    The Great Patriotic War of 1941 to 1945 was a great test for the agriculture of collective farms and state-owned farms. Soviet agriculture gloriously passed this historical test. The strength and vitality of the collective farmers are manifested in this aspect.

    The peasant problem has been solved in the Soviet Union for many centuries. This points out to the world the only correct path for the working peasant masses to get rid of exploitation and poverty, the only correct path to increase agricultural productivity, and the only correct path to lead millions of peasant masses towards a wealthy and cultural life.

    The experience of socialist transformation of agriculture is an inspiring example for other countries that have embarked on the road of socialist construction. This agricultural reform in the Soviet Union was realized according to Comrade Stalin's plan and under his leadership.

    The Establishment of the Socialist Material Production Base. Our Country's Preparation for Active National Defense.

    After the Soviet state established first-class socialist heavy industry and collective agriculture, by the end of the First Five-Year Plan, it had established a solid socialist economic foundation, that is, the economic foundation in the Soviet Union for eliminating classes and building a socialist society.

    As a result of our country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the socialist system won victory in all sectors of the Soviet national economy. The multi-component economy of the transition period gave way to the single-type economy of the socialist period. The question of "who will win" has been resolved. Socialism has won.

    By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the remnants of the exploiting classes were completely eliminated, and the causes that produced the phenomenon of man exploiting man and divided society into exploiters and the exploited were eliminated forever.

    Our country's policy of thoroughly implementing socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization also enabled the country to prepare for active defense.

    As a result of implementing several Stalin Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union achieved economic independence.

    Due to the development of industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union no longer needs to import various machines, equipment and raw materials, and has greatly enhanced its military and economic power.

    Due to the far-sighted policies of the Lenin-Stalin Party, and due to the implementation of several Stalin Five-Year Plans, our country had grasped the material resources necessary to meet the needs of modern military technology of the Soviet army before entering World War II. In this regard, our country's situation was fundamentally different from the situation in Tsarist Russia before World War I. At that time, the Russian army not only did not have enough shells, but even did not have enough rifles.

    The economic foundation of the Soviet Union, which can be used to carry out wars, exceeds the economic foundation of old Russia several times over. The material possibilities of national defense were successfully used in the Great Patriotic War to enable the Soviet Union to win the victory over Fascist Germany and Japanese imperialism.

    The End of the Transition Period. The End of the New Economic Policy.

    The Construction of Socialism in the First Stage of Communism in the Soviet Union.

    The complete victory of the socialist economic system and the elimination of all exploiting classes means that capitalist Russia has been transformed into socialist Russia, a transformation that Lenin had already predicted at the end of 1922.

    Comrade Stalin scientifically demonstrated this fact in his report on the draft of the Soviet Constitution (1936): Our Soviet society has reached the point where it has basically realized socialism and has created the socialist system—the system of the first stage of communism.

    The Stalin Constitution, as the fundamental law of the Soviet Union, consolidated the political and economic cornerstones of socialist society, such as the socialist ownership of the means of production, the elimination of exploitation, the planned management of the national economy, the elimination of unemployment and poverty, and labor is the obligation and glorious duty performed by every able-bodied citizen according to the formula "he who does not work, neither shall he eat", and labor remuneration depends on the quality and quantity of each person's labor. These basic cornerstones of socialism are all fixed in this constitution through legislative procedures.

    The Stalin Constitution fixed a fact of worldwide historical significance: that the Soviet Union has entered the stage of completing the construction of socialist society and gradually transitioning to communist society.

      ×    ×    ×

    As a result of the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union, the laws of capitalist social development have been eliminated, and new laws of economic and political development have been formed.

    Socialism first of all means that the ownership of the means of production does not belong to individuals, but to the entire society, to all the working people.

    There are two forms of socialist property in the Soviet Union: state (public) property and cooperative collective farm property.

    Since there are only these two forms of socialist property in the Soviet Union, there are only two social classes: workers, collective farmers, and the Soviet intelligentsia. But there are no essential contradictions between workers and peasants, just as there are between them and intellectuals. They are all workers in a single socialist society. Certain differences still exist between workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and are currently disappearing, because the countryside is gradually rising to the level of the city in all aspects, and workers and peasants are culturally rising to the level of engineering and technical workers.

    Socialism has achieved the complete elimination of contradictions and inconsistencies between the forces of production and the relations of production. This means that the forces of production have obtained limitless development, and this means that from now on, economic crises have

    苏联从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期（续完）
    苏联哲学博士  尤金
    工业化的速度，苏维埃的国家工业化方法，建立重工业的资金来源。
    当时的任务，是要在最短的历史期间内实行社会主义工业化，整个国内外的环境，都要求工业化必须要有最快的速度。
    斯大林同志在一九三一年二月阐明高度发展速度的历史必要时说：“我们比先进国家落后了五十年以至一百年，我们应当在十年以内跑完这个距离。或者是我们做到这一点，或者是我们被敌人打翻。”只有在斯大林同志所发现的苏维埃的工业化方法的帮助下，有赖于它超越于资本主义工业化方法的优点，才能在短促的历史期间把我国变为工业国。
    “苏维埃的国家工业化方法，是与资本主义的工业化方法根本不同的。在各资本主义国家中，工业化通常都是从轻工业方面开始。因为在轻工业方面，较之重工业来说，所需要的投资数量少些，资本周转得快些，而且获利也较容易，所以那里的轻工业也就成为工业化的首先的对象。只有经过一个长时期，让轻工业积蓄一些利润而将其集中于银行以后，才会轮到重工业方面，开始来逐渐把所积蓄的资本转用到重工业中去，造成保证它发展的条件。但这是一个悠久的过程，需要在数十年长久的时期内，静待轻工业发展起来，而在没有重工业的情形下勉强过活。共产党当然不能走这条道路。党知道战争日益逼近，没有重工业就无法保卫国家，所以必须赶快着手发展重工业，假如这件事情稍迟一着，那就等于失败。党记住了列宁的指示：没有重工业，便无法保持国家的独立；没有重工业，苏维埃制度就会灭亡。因此我国共产党也就排斥了‘通常的’工业化道路，而从发展重工业来开始实行国家工业化。这是一件极困难的事情，但这种困难是可能克服的。在这方面，工业和银行国有化大大帮助了我们，使我们能够迅速聚集巨量资金，转用到重工业方面去。
    毫无疑义，如果我们没有这样作，我们便无法在这样一个短促期间把我国变成为工业国”（斯大林一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科市斯大林选区选民大会上的演说）
    在极短的历史期间内在一个大国实行工业化，是有很大困难的。同时建设许多大的重工业企业，需要投入巨额的资金。现代大工业的建设，通常需时数年之久，在这数年过程中投入很多的资金，而只在新企业开工后，才能得到有益的效果。所以工业化要求把大量资金长期地从国民经济中抽调出来。
    在资本主义国家的工业化中，除了对“本国”工人和农民进行无情的剥削外，外国资金的流入也起了很大的作用。斯大林同志在总结资本主义国家工业发展的历史经验时，指出了三种工业化方式：靠殖民地的掠夺（英国），靠军事赔款（德国），靠奴役性的借款和租让（沙皇俄国）。对于苏联来说，这些工业化方式和动员资金来进行工业建设的方式，一开始就被抛弃了。斯大林同志根据对社会主义经济制度优点的估计，发现了依靠本身资源，依靠有计划地实行社会主义积累的新的工业化道路。
    既然工业、运输业、土地、银行都是苏维埃国家的财产，那末，工人和农民创造的财富，也就不是用来满足资产阶级的寄生性欲望，而是用来满足社会主义工业发展的需要。其次，苏维埃政权使国民经济免于支付年达数万万卢布之多的沙皇债款利息。农民免于向地主缴纳地租（每年约为五万万卢布），免于对银行大量负债。与工业繁荣利害相关的农民，能够把他们一部分资金用于这一目的上。苏维埃国家进行了不断的斗争，来提高劳动生产率和降低成本，严格遵守开支上的节约制度，提高劳动纪律。
    所有这些内部积累的源泉，供给了我们数十万万卢布。苏维埃政权把这样积累起来的资金投入了国家工业化中。于是，工业化当中最困难的任务——积累资金来建立重工业的任务——就获得了解决。
    苏联工业化的实行，只是从第一个斯大林五年计划的第一年（一九二八——一九二九年）起，才真正展开的。投资总额第一个五年计划中为五百一十亿卢布，第二个五年计划中为一千三百七十五亿卢布。这些资金的大部是用来发展工业和运输业的。
    这一切就使得苏联在极短时间内大规模地创立起社会主义生产力来。在国内出现了成百上千的具有头等现代装备的新工厂，旧工厂也都予以改造并添设了新的技术装备。
    除了采用新技术外，还需要大量具有必要生产经验并掌握了技术的新干部。掌握了新技术的干部的不够，是工业顺利发展中最严重的障碍之一。因此，一个最严重的任务，就是为新建的工业企业培养干部。这些任务都顺利地解决了。充满了真正建设热情的千百万劳动群众，克服了无数的障碍，广泛展开了社会主义竞赛。新的工业建设达到了空前未有的规模。
    苏联从落后的农业国变为先进的工业强国
    在几个斯大林五年计划的年代里，成千成万的具有最新技术装备起来的新工厂建立起来并且开工了。
    在这些工厂中，有数十个巨型的社会主义企业，全国都参加了建设它们的工作。这就是马格尼托奇尔斯克和库兹涅茨冶炼厂，德涅泊水电站，莫斯科和高尔基城的汽车工厂，斯大林格勒，哈尔科夫，乞梁宾斯克的拖拉机工厂，罗斯托夫的农业机器工厂，康拜因工厂，大的车床制造厂，莫斯科的滚珠工厂，斯大林诺、索里加门和伯列兹里克的化学联合工厂，以及其他许多的企业。此外成千的企业在新的技术基础上实行了改造。
    建立了数十个革命前俄国所没有的新工业部门。
    社会主义工业成长为苏联国民经济的决定力量了。工业生产总额大大地增加了。只一个德涅泊水电站，在第二个五年计划结束时，就生产出了比沙皇俄国所有发电厂都多的电力。三个巨大的黑色金属冶炼厂——马格尼托哥尔斯克，库兹涅茨和麦克耶夫工厂——炼出了比沙皇俄国全部黑色金属冶炼业还多的生铁。
    在最短的历史期间——十三年中，苏联走过了发达的资本主义国家大约花了十倍时间才走完的路程。苏联由落后的农业国变为先进的工业强国了。按工业生产总量来说，沙皇俄国在欧洲占第四位，在世界占第五位，到第二个五年计划结束时，苏联已屹立于欧洲的第一位，世界的第二位了（仅次于美国）。
    苏联成了经济上独立的国家，它以一切必要的技术装备满足着经济和国防方面日益增长的需要。由此可见，社会主义工业化保证了我们祖国在经济上的独立自主。奠定了我们祖国军事经济威力的巩固基础。
    一九一三年大工业和农业的总产量中，工业占百分之四二·一，农业占百分之五七·九；一九三七年，工业已占百分之七七·四，而农业只占百分之一七·九了。根据一九二六年的人口统计，城市人口占百分之一七·九，乡村人口占百分之八二·一；根据一九三六年的人口统计，城市人口占百分之三二·八，而农业人口为百分之六七·二。工人职员的人数，由一九一三年的一千一百四十万，增长到了一九三七年的二千七百万，一九四○年的三千零四十万了。
    沙皇俄国从国外输入了全国五分之二以上的工业、运输业和其他国民经济部门中应用的机器。如果拿工业来说，则它所装备的外国机器几占三分之二，而纺织工业甚至占四分之三。在苏联第二个五年计划的前夜，从外国输入约占全国三分之一的机器。一九三二年，输入的机器已不到百分之一三，而在一九三七年，仅为百分之零·九了。于是，长久阻碍我国发展的机器恐慌已成过去，苏联摆脱了对资本主义国家的依赖，而经济上的独立获得了保证。
    列宁的合作社计划
    在社会主义社会的建设中，农业的社会主义改造任务占有特殊的地位。
    甚至在工业最发达的资本主义各国，农业也还是国民经济中最落后的部门，小农经济占很大的比重。资本主义制度下，农民是小生产者阶级，他们受着地主、富农、商人、投机者、高利贷者的残酷剥削。科学社会主义的创始者都指明过，而资本主义发展的历史也一再地证明了，在资产阶级社会条件下，独立农民基本群众是注定要破产和贫穷下去的。
    工人阶级取得政权之后，他们必然要面临着解决这个许多世纪以来的农民问题的任务。马列主义唯一正确地解决了农民问题。
    由于伟大十月社会主义革命的结果，农村阶级结构中发生了极其巨大的变化，苏维埃农民从历来地主剥削者手中解放出来了。富农也受到了极大的摧毁。苏维埃农民获得了巨大的物质果实。
    苏维埃政权最初数年，已使农村逐渐中农化了。大部分贫农获得土地以后，由于苏维埃政权的帮助都已上升到中农的水平。因此中农的数量没有像在资本主义时那样减退下去，而是增长起来了。中农成了农业的中心人物。而同时，农业资本家阶级——富农还有颇大的力量。
    工人阶级在农民劳动群众这方面的任务，就是要把他们从个体农民经济的轨道上引导到大规模的社会主义农业的轨道上来，从而吸收他们参加社会主义建设。斯大林同志说：“主要的就在于，要与农民一起去建设社会主义，一定要与农民一起去建设，而且一定要在工人阶级的领导之下，因为工人阶级的领导乃是这个建设沿着社会主义道路前进的根本保证”。
    苏维埃政权以前，历史上只有一条建立大规模农业生产的道路。那就是资本主义的道路，它是与许多小经济的破产和灭亡，与广大农民群众的无数灾难和困苦相联系着的。
    伟大十月社会主义革命开辟了新的、社会主义的、列宁和斯大林所规定的农业发展道路。一九四六年二月斯大林同志说过：“为要消灭我国农业方面的落后情形，而为国家多多供给粮食和棉花等等，就必须由小农经济过渡到大规模的农业，因为只有大规模的农业才能采用新的技术，利用农学上的一切成就，而生产更多的商品农产物。但大规模的农业有两种，一种是资本主义的农业；另一种是集体的农业。共产党决不能走资本主义的农业发展道路，这不仅是因为有原则上的理由，而且因为这种道路要有一个过分长久的发展过程，并且预先要使农民破产，使他们变成雇农。因此，共产党便走了农业集体化的道路，走了把各个农户联合为集体农庄，借以巩固农业经济的道路。集体化的方法乃是最进步的方法，这不仅因为它并不要农民破产，而特别是因为它使我们能够在几年以内便在全国布满了能够采用新技术，利用一切农学成就，而多多供给国家商品农产物的大规模集体农庄。
    毫无疑义，如果我们没有实行集体化政策，那我们便不能在这样一个短促的时期内消灭我国农业历来落后的情形”。
    吸收农民到社会主义建设事业中来的合作社计划，还在新经济政策开始时就由列宁提出了。列宁合作社计划的要点如下：建立强大的、能够改造农业的工业；起初设立最简单的、供销形式的合作社，借以培养农民的集体习惯，准备好必要条件后，就开始由小私有经济转向大规模的、公共的、农业劳动组合经济的道路。列宁的合作社计划认为，在苏维埃政权下，合作社恰恰是千百万农民可以接受的，可以了解的，从分散的个体经济过渡到大规模的生产联合——集体农庄的道路。列宁认为这个过渡的基本条件就是工人阶级对农民的领导和社会主义大工业的发展，因为这样的工业乃是在技术上改变农业的基础。在工人阶级专政的条件下，基本生产资料都集中在苏维埃政权手中。这时，合作社就成为社会主义的经济形态。在工人阶级专政的条件下，正是合作社起初在供销方面，然后又在生产方面把集体主义的原则植根于农民中去。
    在这一点上，列宁曾把合作社称作走向社会主义的大路，他指出在我国条件下单纯的合作制发展就等于社会主义发展。列宁预见到，合作社这个联合着最广大劳动农民群众的组织，乃是借以解决农村的社会主义改造任务的一个环节。
    列宁教导说，把农民从个体经济的道路引导到集体经济的轨道上来，必须按照自愿的原则，必须使他们相信公共的集体经济优越于个体经济。列宁的自愿原则驳斥了对待中农的任何强迫的态度，这个原则是集体农庄建设中最重要的原则之一。
    全面集体化前提的创造
    社会主义国家工业化的成就使得有可能实际提出农村的社会主义改造任务。国内整个政治和经济的形势迫切要求解决这个任务。
    恢复时期将近结束时，农业整个说来已超过战前水平。但它的主要部门——谷物业——只达到战前产量的十分之九。而工业的扩大，城市人口的增长一年比一年要求更多的粮食和原料。要满足这个要求，农村中的小生产是不可能的。农民经济的碎裂仍然继续着。小的分散的个体农民经济只具有极可怜的工具，因此它就不能真正地把收获量提高多少。
    一九二七年，恢复时期以后的第一年，苏维埃农村中约有百分之六十为中农，百分之三十五为贫农，和百分之四到五为富农。
    一九二六年和一九二七年，城市消费的粮食四分之三由中农和贫农经济中取得。地主的经济消灭了，革命以前他们提供全部在农村以外流通的粮食的五分之一以上。富农经济在供给粮食方面的比重，缩减了一倍半，就是从一半缩减到五分之一。
    但是小农经济出售到市场上的只稍稍多于全部生产出的粮食的十分之一。因此，这个经济带有半自然的性质，它的商品率是非常低微的。虽然全国生产出的谷物只比战前时期少一点，但到市场上来满足增长着的工业人口的需要的，却比战前数量少了三分之二。在这里就表现出谷物业的危机，这危机同时还有引起畜牧业危机的危险。
    谷物业的危机说明，大规模的社会主义工业不能与小农经济并行顺利地发展。这种矛盾如果保持下来就使得国民经济有全部崩溃的危险。
    农村的中农化，农户数目的增多，和农村经济的半自然性质，使得农村供给城市，供给工厂的劳动力越来越少。
    造成这样一种威胁，就是不断要求大量新工人的、急速增长着的社会主义工业，将要得不到这个供应，因而就不得不把自己的发展速度停顿下来。
    要解决这个对于社会主义工业说来，最为重要的问题，只有在农业技术上实行革命，和将农业过渡到社会主义。
    一九二七年年底，在作为集体化的代表大会而载入史册的第十五次党代表大会上，根据斯大林同志的提议，通过了全力展开过渡到集体农庄的决定。
    斯大林同志在代表大会上的报告中指出：“出路就在于用公共耕种制做基础来把零散的小农庄联合为大农庄，用新的更高的技术做基础来实行集体耕种制。”
    社会主义的国家工业化是实行农业的社会主义改造的关键。以机器和拖拉机供给农业的必要基础已建立起来了。
    农民大批转向集体农庄道路的过程是由农业合作社的发展而准备成的。农业合作社培养着农民扩大阶层集体管理经济事务的初步习惯。
    农民经济合作化的第一个阶段，是推销农产品和供给生产资料及消费资料（即工业品）的合作社。这种合作社形式已经就培养着农民广大阶层共同管理经济事务的初步习惯。在这一阶段上，社会主义工业和农民经济间的联系，主要是带有商业性质。然而在这一阶段有许多情形下即已建立起农民经济与国家工业间比较紧密的相互关系，譬如个别种类的农业合作社（如亚麻等）联合了许多生产组合，供给他们以种籽和生产工具，把它们的产品推销给社会主义工业而取消了任何的中间剥削。这已是如斯大林同志所说的“农业方面大规模的国家社会主义生产的家庭制度”。
    在过渡到大规模集体生产的集体农庄乃是农民合作化的最高阶段。
    农民过渡到集体农庄道路的过程在政治上也是准备成熟了的。列宁——斯大林的党从十月革命最初时起就不倦的在农村中进行了对农民的政治启蒙工作，从各方面提高农民群众的文化水平。
    如是，经济和政治发展的全部进程已为劳动农民群众准备了过渡到社会主义发展道路的前提。
    农业集体化是农业的社会主义改造道路
    斯大林同志根据列宁的合作社计划，全面制定了农业集体化的理论，并以自己的天才领导保证了集体农庄制度的胜利。
    斯大林同志根据马列主义再生产的理论指出，不能在多少长久的时期内，把苏维埃政权的社会主义建设事业建筑在两种不同类型的社会基础上，建筑在最巨大集中的社会主义工业基础上和最散漫落后的小商品经济基础上。在全国范围内联合起来的社会主义大工业按着社会主义扩大再生产原则，以极快的速度发展着，并消灭着资本主义成份，而同时，分散的、个体的小农经济甚至连简单再生产也不是经常能够进行的，而且还不断的产生着资本主义成份。斯大林同志曾经指出唯一正确的出路——就是巩固农业的社会主义道路，建设国营农场和集体农庄的道路。
    在资本主义条件下，农村是自流式地跟着城市走的，它完全按照在城市中、在资本主义工业中产生出的那些经济发展规律行进。这是因为，城市中的资本主义经济和农村中的小农经济基本上是同一类型的经济形态。二者都是以生产资料的私有为基础。但绝不能由此得出结论，说农民经济就是资本主义的经济。然而，由于商品生产和竞争的规律，它自流地从自己内部分化出资本主义的成份。
    农民经济向社会主义方面发展则是另外一回事，这个发展不是顺着自发的市场规律进行，而是违反着这些规律进行的，农村本身是不能自流地跟着社会主义城市走的。列宁曾说过，“农民有商品资本主义趋势”，即是与无产阶级社会主义趋势背道而驰的趋势，只有工人阶级的领导才能保证社会主义在农村中的胜利，苏维埃国家设置国营农场和集体农庄，给予它们一切的物质支援，以示范的力量使农民群众相信社会主义大生产的优越，而在农村中组织了巨大的社会主义经济。
    还没拥有农业机器拖拉机站的第一批集体农庄，可说是“集体农庄建设的工场手工业时期”。它们所依据的是农民生产工具的简单配合。以农民自愿归为公有的原有生产资料的这种配合为基础的集体生产，就已表现出大大优越于小型的个体经济的地方。在集体农庄运动最初开始时，大生产的优点最鲜明地表现在播种面积的扩大上，这种扩大是由于开垦了个体劳动所难于耕作的熟荒和生荒，消灭了地界和土地零散现象等等而来的。
    集体农庄对个体经济的优势，随着农业在技术上的改造而愈加增长。
    斯大林同志在群众性的集体农庄运动一开始时就指出，集体农庄建设的基本而主要的环节是农业劳动组合，因为，第一，劳动组合把集体农民个人日常生活利益和他们的公共利益正确的结合起来。第二，劳动组合顺利地使个人日常生活的利益适应于公共利益，从而易于以集体精神来教育昨天的个体农民。农业机器站是农业的社会主义改造事业中的支柱，是社会主义国家帮助农业和农民的支柱。
    在许多年过程中，党和苏维埃国家在农村里建立着新的技术装备——拖拉机，复杂的农业机器，并培养着能掌握这种技术的干部。农业机器站网建立起来了，这些农业机器站乃是苏维埃国家用以把各个农户联合成集体农庄的重要工具。
    这就是说，在农村中创造了新的生产力。而历史唯物主义理论教导我们说，生产力的改变就要引起生产关系的改变。拖拉机，复杂的农业机器，掌握了这些技术的新干部，在小型的个体经济中是得不到应用的。他们要求大规模的社会生产，而这就是说，要建立人们之间的新的生产关系，要建立新的生产资料占有方式。
    因此，苏联的农业集体化乃是我国社会主义发展的规律。向集体农庄过渡，是符合广大农民群众最切身的物质利益的。广大农民群众转向集体农庄的道路，把自己的生产资料，自己的劳动公共化，而创立大规模的劳动组合经济时有着极其高涨热烈的情绪，也就是由于上述一点而来的。
    农民群众走向社会主义的伟大转变
    农民根本转向集体农庄方面来是从一九二九年下半年开始的。农民已经不是个别地一小批、一小批地，而是整村、整乡、整区、甚至整州地加入集体农庄了。而这就正像斯大林同志所指出的，中农也加入了集体农庄。这就是农村经济发展上根本转变的基础，而这种根本转变是苏维埃政权在当时过去一年中最重大的成就。
    在苏维埃农村中，全面集体化的过程开始了，这个过程是由以往的整个发展进程所准备好的。
    农业集体化消灭了农村中资本主义的滋养基础。这种集体化就永远消灭了农民的分化，并截断了资本主义经济死灰复燃的道路。
    “这是一个极深刻的革命，是从社会的旧质态转变到新质态的突变，照结果来说，它是与一九一七年十月革命具有同等意义的”（联共（布）党史简明教程中文本三七五页）。
    这个革命的特殊处，就在于它是由上面、由国家政权来提倡，并由千百万农民群众从下面直接赞助实现的。
    马列主义教导我们说，当新的生产力建立起来了，取消旧的生产关系的必要性成熟了的时候，应该用强力把旧生产关系消灭掉的那些先进思想和新政治制度就获得伟大的作用。新的社会思想组织和动员群众，群众结成为新的政治军队，以便取消生产关系方面的旧制度而奠定新制度。
    革命的经验告诉我们，在社会关系方面发生革命之前，必先发生人们意识中的革命。人们被新的社会制度的思想武装起来。群众意识中的革命进行得越坚决，则社会关系方面的革命就越是彻底。
    由于共产党和工人阶级对农民进行了多年的和坚持不懈的政治教育，所以到了经济上必需转入集体化的时机已成熟时，在农民的意识中就发生了一种极深刻的革命。农民群众意识到自己生活中的这一革命的必要，并根据列宁、斯大林党和苏维埃国家的号召而走上了全面集体化的道路。
    农村中集体农庄制度的胜利与巩固
    苏维埃农村的集体化，在第一个五年计划过程中就已基本上实现了。到第一个五年计划末期，即在一九三二年，二十多万个集体农庄联合了百分之六十以上的农户。这些集体农庄拥有农户的全部播种面积百分之七十以上。
    原先在个体农户占优势时期只采办五万万到六万万普特的商品粮食；而现在每年可采办十二万万到十四万万普特的谷物。富农之为阶级消灭了，劳动农民摆脱了富农的奴役和剥削，并给苏维埃政权在农村中奠定了巩固的经济基础——集体经济的基础。
    到一九三八年，有一千八百八十万个农户，即百分之九十三点五的农户，加入了集体农庄。集体农庄的谷物播种面积，一九三三年是七千五百万海克脱，而到一九三八年，则增加到九千二百万海克脱。在个体经济部分，到一九三八年只占谷物的全部播种面积百分之零点六，而在技术作物方面，个体经济的作用几乎等于零。因此，斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上的报告中指出：“社会主义的经济制度，现在是我们农业的唯一形式”。
    在苏联现在已经建立起最强大的高度机械化的农业。
    国营农场和农业机器站在农村的社会主义改造工作中起着最主要的作用。
    农业机器站是苏维埃政权在提高集体农庄建设事业上的强大杠杆。到第一个五年计划结束时，农业机器站的数目是二千五百个，它们供应了百分之五十的集体农庄播种面积使用。到一九三七年，已有了五千八百个农业机器站，而这些农业机器站供应了百分之九十一点二的集体农庄播种面积使用，到一九四○年，则已有七千多个农业机器站了。
    为实现国家工业化和农村集体化所依据的几个斯大林五年计划，曾在农业方面进行了彻底的技术革命。
    在革命前的农村中有八百万架耕犁。就在第一个五年计划前夜，即一九二八年，也还有四百五十万架左右。只在集体农庄制度胜利后，才彻底把耕犁从田野里驱逐掉了。现在苏联只有在博物馆里才能看到耕犁，它被放在博物馆里与石斧比美。
    一九二四年，在苏联有二千六百架拖拉机，共达二万五千六百匹马力。一九三八年，在社会主义田场上工作的拖拉机已有四十八万四千架，而到一九四○年则增加到五十二万三千架了。
    机械化的收割机——康拜因机（联合收割机）只是在第二个五年计划时才在我们的农业中获得大量采用。在一九三○年，这种收割机的数量，总共是一千七百架，一九三八年是十五万三千架，而到一九四○年，则增加到十八万二千架。
    完善机器的采用——首先是拖拉机和联合收割机的采用——使得农业工作走向广泛的机械化。譬如还在一九二八年时，差不多全部春莳谷物耕地的十分之一是用犁耕的，将近十分之九是用马拉犁耕的，而采用拖拉机耕的，总共只占百分之一。到一九三八年，春莳的耕地用拖拉机的已达四分之三，用马拉犁的占四分之一，而耕犁已无踪迹了。在一九三二年只有二十五分之一的谷物面积采用联合收割机收割，而到一九三八年，已有一半的谷物面积采用联合收割机收割了。
    农村中新的生产力与新的生产关系；即社会主义的生产方式，保证了农业的迅速高涨，保证了农产品、尤其是谷物和技术作物的大量增加。
    大规模的社会主义农业具有很高的商品产量。譬如革命前的俄国，谷物业的商品产量为百分之二十六，而苏联集体农庄和国营农场的谷物生产商品产量，到一九三八年为百分之四十。由于集体农庄和国营农场生产有着高度的商品产量，苏联的农业在一九四○年产出了三千八百三十万吨商品谷物，即比一九一三年多出了一千七百万吨。正是由于集体农庄和国营农场有着这种特点，我国才能如此容易迅速地解决谷物的问题，解决了充分供给这样大的国家以商品谷物的问题。
    农业的社会主义改造，是工人阶级取得政权之后一个最困难的社会主义革命任务。在掌握在苏维埃国家手里的大工业方面，技术改造已有基本上已准备好的社会经济基础。而在农业方面，极端落后的技术基础的改造，要是不同时改造旧的社会经济成份，不把小的个体经济联合成为大的集体经济，不把在分散的小生产的条件下保留下来的资本主义的根子统统拔掉，那是不可能的。社会主义的敌人时时刻刻都在预言这种事业的“破产”。集体农庄制度的胜利却把他们指望社会主义破产的种种希望全给推翻了。
    一九四一年到一九四五年的伟大卫国战争对集体农庄和国营农场的农业来说，乃是一个伟大的考验。苏联的农业光荣地经起了这一历史的考验。集体农民的力量和活力就表现在这方面。
    在苏联解决了许多世纪以来的农民问题，这给全世界指出了一条使劳动农民群众摆脱剥削与贫困的唯一正确的道路，指出了一条提高农业生产力的唯一正确的道路，指出了一条使数千百万农民群众走向富裕与文化生活的唯一正确的道路。
    农业的社会主义改造的经验，对于业已踏上社会主义建设道路的其他国家来说，乃是一种鼓舞人心的范例，苏联的这种农业改革是根据斯大林同志的计划及在他的领导下实现的。
    社会主义物质生产基地的建立。我国对积极国防的准备。
    苏维埃国家建立了头等的社会主义重工业和集体农业之后，在第一个五年计划结束时，就已建立了坚固的社会主义经济基础，即在苏联为了消灭阶级及建成社会主义社会的经济基础。
    由于我国社会主义工业化和农业集体化的结果，社会主义制度就在苏联国民经济的各个部门取得了胜利。过渡时期多种成份的经济让位给社会主义时期单一类型的经济了。“谁战胜谁”的问题解决了。社会主义赢得了胜利。
    在第二个五年计划结束时，彻底消灭了剥削阶级的残余，永远消灭了产生人剥削人现象及将社会划分为剥削者与被剥削者的原因。
    我国彻底实行社会主义工业化和农业集体化的政策，同时也就使国家有了进行积极防御的准备。
    执行几届斯大林五年计划的结果，苏联达到了经济上的独立自主了。
    由于发展工业和农业，苏联已不须要输入各种机器设备和原料，并大大增强自己的军事经济威力。
    由于列宁、斯大林党的有远见的政策，由于执行了几届斯大林五年计划，我国在进入第二次世界大战之前，即已掌握了为满足苏军现代军事技术需要必不可少的物质资源。在这方面，我国的情况与沙俄在第一次世界大战前的情况有着根本上的区别，当时俄国的军队不仅没有足够的炮弹，甚至连步枪也不够。
    苏联的经济基础，是可以用来进行战争的，它超过旧俄的经济基础好几倍。国防的物质可能在伟大卫国战争中是被顺利地利用来使苏联赢得了对法西斯德国及对日本帝国主义的胜利。
    过渡时期的完结。新经济政策的结束。
    在苏联共产主义第一阶段——社会主义的建设。
    社会主义经济制度的彻底胜利，一切剥削阶级之被消灭，这就是说，已把资本主义的俄罗斯变成了社会主义的俄罗斯，关于这个转变，列宁还在一九二二年底即已预言过了。
    斯大林同志在论苏联宪法草案的报告中（一九三六年）就科学地论证了这一事实：我们苏维埃社会已达到了这一步，就是它在基本上已实现了社会主义，已创立了社会主义制度——共产主义第一阶段的制度。
    作为苏联根本法的斯大林宪法巩固了社会主义社会的政治、经济柱石。如生产资料的社会主义所有制，剥削之被消灭，国民经济有计划的经营，失业贫困现象的消灭，劳动是每个有工作能力公民按“不劳动者不得食”这一公式履行的义务和光荣职责，劳动报酬取决于每个人的劳动质和量等这样一些社会主义的基本柱石，全都以立法手续固定在这一宪法中了。
    斯大林宪法固定了这样一个具有全世界历史意义的事实：即苏联已经进到完成社会主义社会建设和逐渐过渡到共产主义社会。

    由于在苏联建成了社会主义的结果，就消灭了资本主义的社会发展规律，和形成了新的经济、政治发展规律。
    社会主义首先就是意味着，生产资料的所有权不是属于个别的人，而是属于整个社会，属于全体劳动人民。
    在苏联有两种社会主义财产形式：即国家的（全民的）财产，及合作社集体农庄的财产。
    由于在苏联只有这两种社会主义财产形式，所以也就只有两个社会阶级：工人，集体农民，以及苏维埃知识界。但是在工人与农民之间，也如同在他们与知识分子之间一样，没有任何本质的矛盾，他们都是单一的社会主义社会的劳动者。工人，农民及知识界间现在还存在着某些差别，目前正日益泯灭着，因为农村正在各个方面逐渐上升到城市的水平，而工人和农民在文化方面正日益升到工程技术劳动人员的水平。
    社会主义已达到了彻底消灭生产力与生产关系之间的矛盾和不一致。这就是说，生产力得到了无止境的发展，这就是说，从今以后，在苏联已彻底消灭了经济危机。
    与资本主义相反，社会主义的经济是按扩大的和不断加速的再生产的规律发展的。从社会主义的这一规律可以得出结论说，社会主义生产力的发展是无止境无阻碍的，这是以加快的速度按日益上升的路线不断发展的过程。
    社会主义的生产方式产生了资本主义所没有的社会发展的新动力，这就是人民在道义上政治上的一致性，苏维埃的爱国主义和各族人民友谊。社会主义的这些动力的发展是无阻碍的，它们正在不断地发展，并保证社会主义社会在走向共产主义途程中全面的发展。
    社会主义彻底消灭了剥削阶级和人对人的剥削，保证全体苏联人民不断改善自己的物质状况，引导苏联人民走向富裕与文化的生活。社会主义保证不断提高我国全体人民的物质生活及文化。这是社会主义社会发展的不易的社会规律。
    社会主义社会的经济发展，是带有计划性的，它与资本主义的经济相反，资本主义经济的发展是自发的，无政府状态的。社会主义经济的计划性，是合理地利用着我国的一切天然资源、技术和人的生产力。这一点造成了对资本主义的巨大优越，因为计划经济是没有非生产的、疯狂浪费物质资财和人的劳动的现象的。
    苏维埃国家和共产党是苏维埃社会向共产主义道路发展的重要的组织力量和领导力量。巩固苏维埃国家的威力，乃是社会主义社会发展的牢不可破的规律，因为只有强大的苏维埃国家才能保证苏维埃社会的经济、文化和军事力量的全面的繁荣。
    苏维埃社会主义的胜利，对全世界的劳动人民乃是一个鼓舞人心的范例。苏联鼓舞着全世界的工人阶级和农民去为争取自己的解放而斗争。社会主义现在已被提到整个人类社会的议事日程上来了。中欧和东南欧各国的工人阶级和农民正按照苏联工人阶级的榜样稳步踏上了社会主义建设的大道，并在这方面获得了伟大的成就。在这些国家里，社会主义已经在城市里，在工业上取得了胜利，已经彻底奠定了社会主义的生产方式。在这些国家的农村中，同样也紧接到社会主义的农业改造。建立了成千的第一批集体农庄和上万混合型的生产合作社。中欧和东南欧的各人民民主国家，在经济发展上均获得了最伟大的成功。所有这些国家都早已超过了战前的经济水平，他们与马歇尔化的国家大不相同，那些马歇尔化的国家还没有消灭战争的后果，又便重新遭到日益增长的经济危机的打击。
    伟大中国人民革命的胜利，是有全世界历史意义的。这个胜利，按其结果来看，对国际帝国主义的命运来说，是在苏联十月革命之后最具有决定意义的胜利。
    伟大的中国人民，在光荣的共产党领导下，在中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，粉碎了国民党的反动势力，并把日本侵略者和美英帝国主义者赶出了自己的国境。
    因此，在中国人民面前展开了一个无限广阔的前途；彻底消灭封建的土地所有制和对农民的封建剥削。在牢不可破的工农联盟基础上，在工人阶级领导下，中国人民已坚决地走上了社会生活各方面民主发展的道路，而且必然要走到社会主义。
    随着伟大中国人民革命的胜利，随着中华人民共和国的成立，民主和社会主义的力量在反对帝国主义的国际斗争舞台上，已得到空前未有的壮大与巩固。
    现在已有十多个国家，人口总数达八万万以上，是在工人阶级的领导下，是在共产党的领导下，在这些国家中有世界上最大国家：苏联和中华人民共和国。
    在各资本主义国家内，工人阶级的基本群众和广大的农民阶层是跟着共产党走的。反对战争挑拨者的战士的运动，保卫和平的战士的运动，说明着各族人民对于美英及其他侵略的帝国主义者的仇恨是何等的深重。
    美帝国主义者急于发动第三次世界大战，首先是为反对苏联、中国及西方各人民民主国家。美帝国主义目前正在朝鲜进行殖民地的强盗战争。这一个战争更加把全世界的劳动人民团结起来反对美英帝国主义者，反对整个人类社会的凶恶的敌人。
    第一次世界大战结束时，曾使最强大的资本主义国家之一——俄国——脱离了世界资本主义体系。第二次世界大战，又使中欧和东南欧的许多国家以及中国脱离了国际帝国主义体系。
    如果美英帝国主义要发动世界大战的话，那么全世界的人民都会要起来反对他们的。这个战争必定要引起整个国际帝国主义体系的崩溃，以及在全世界奠定民主与社会主义的原则。
    帝国主义阵营的力量一天比一天更加削弱了。和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量都一天比一天更加壮大与巩固。
    和平、民主和社会主义一定会彻底战胜美帝国主义的侵略势力。这种必然胜利的保证，就是领导和平和社会主义阵营的是强大的苏联与苏联并肩前进的有伟大的中华人民共和国，西方各人民民主国家，以及资本主义国家和殖民地国家的劳动人民。
    和平、民主和社会主义的一切国际力量，正在整个劳动人类的天才领袖与导师斯大林同志的领导下团结起来。（完）
