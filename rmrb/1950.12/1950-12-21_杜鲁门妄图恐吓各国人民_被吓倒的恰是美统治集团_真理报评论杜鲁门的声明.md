Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: Pravda published an editorial on the 19th, commenting on Truman's speech announcing the United States' entry into a "national emergency," stating: If the current rulers of the United States can only implement their policies through emergency measures, then things must be turning out very badly for them! The failure of the shameful gamble in Korea has aroused even greater dissatisfaction within the United States with the policies of Truman, MacArthur, Harriman, Kennan, and Acheson. Calls for revising American foreign policy are growing louder. Former US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, said: "Our country's policy today is politically and morally bankrupt." Christian Science Monitor commentator Harsch wrote: "When a country's foreign policy suffers a failure like the one our policy has suffered in Korea, it is time to humbly review the entire process that created these difficulties."

The editorial continued: Truman's speech should be seen primarily as a special response to those who criticize him, mainly as an expression that the current US government intends to continue its already bankrupt aggressive policy. Obviously, this will only lead to more failures. The failure of Truman and MacArthur's adventure in Korea, as well as the previous failure of US policy toward China, has also caused great panic among the ruling groups in Western European countries. Truman's speech is undoubtedly also intended to reassure his frightened vassals, making them trust in the strength of the United States, a trust that has been greatly weakened by recent events. Finally, the declaration of a "national emergency" aims to spread more war hysteria and intensify preparations for a new war.

The editorial further pointed out: The purpose of declaring a "national emergency" is also to eliminate the democratic rights of the American people, so that American monopoly capitalists can arbitrarily exploit the working people and earn billions more in profits from weapons orders that bring death to millions of working people. The editorial mocked: Truman's attempt to intimidate peace-loving people of all countries with America's war preparations is futile. It seems that it is the US ruling clique itself that has been frightened. Otherwise, they would not have resorted to emergency measures.

    杜鲁门妄图恐吓各国人民  被吓倒的恰是美统治集团
    真理报评论杜鲁门的声明
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十九日发表社论，就杜鲁门宣布美国进入“全国紧急状态”的演说评称：如果美国目前的统治者只有用紧急措施的手段才能实行他们的政策，那么，事情一定是变得对他们很不妙了！在朝鲜的可耻赌博的失败，已经引起美国国内对杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、哈里曼、凯南、艾奇逊的政策的更大不满。要求修改美国外交政策的呼声日益响亮。前美国驻英大使肯尼第说：“我国今日的政策在政治上与道义上已经破产。”基督教科学箴言报评论员哈许写道：“当一国的外交政策遭到像我国政策在朝鲜所已遭到的这种失败时，那就是谦逊地检讨造成这些困难的全部过程的时候了。”
    社论继称：应该把杜鲁门的演说看作主要是对批评他的人的特别的答复，主要是目前的美国政府打算继续进行其已经破产的侵略政策的表示。显然，这只会造成更多的失败而已。杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟在朝鲜进行冒险的失败，以及先前美国对华政策的失败，在西欧国家的统治集团间也引起了很大的恐慌。杜鲁门的演说无疑也打算使他的那些受惊的附庸国安心，使它们信任美国的力量，由于最近的事件，这种信任已经大大地削弱了。最后，宣布“全国紧急状态”旨在散布更多的战争歇斯底里，并加紧准备新战争。
    社论进而指出：宣布“全国紧急状态”，目的也在于取消美国人民的民主权利，以便美国垄断资本家可以任意地剥削劳动人民，并且在为千百万劳动人民带来死亡的武器定货上再赚取成十亿的利润。社论嘲笑说：杜鲁门企图以美国的战争准备来恫吓爱好和平的各国人民，这是毫无用处的。看来被吓倒了的，倒是美国统治集团本身。不然的话，他们就不会乞灵于紧急措施了。
