    Engels—Great Revolutionary Thinker and Leader of the Proletariat
    (Commemorating the 130th Anniversary of Engels' Birth)
    Editor's Note: November 28th of this year marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of Engels, one of the founders of scientific communism. To commemorate this great revolutionary teacher, the Soviet philosopher Miting wrote this essay, which was published in the 108th issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" This essay briefly narrates Engels' brilliant achievements in various fields, outlining the life of this great revolutionary fighter of the proletariat and outstanding scientist. In this essay, the author points out some shortcomings that occasionally occurred in Engels' many great and multifaceted activities.

    Friedrich Engels is one of the most beloved and respected names of the working class in all countries. Engels was a great revolutionary fighter, an outstanding scientist and thinker, a loyal comrade and friend of Karl Marx, and one of the founders of scientific communism.

    The historical task and significance of Marx and Engels' work is inestimable. They armed the working people with the theory of the inevitable demise of the capitalist system, with the recognition of the historical task borne by the working class as the gravedigger of capitalism and as the leader of all working people in the struggle for a new socialist society. For the first time in history, Marx and Engels scientifically proved that socialism is by no means an empty and unrealizable idea of ​​utopianists and dreamers. For the first time in history, they proved that this is the historically inevitable result of the development of modern society and class struggle.

    Marx and Engels taught that the history of human society is the history of class struggle. The working class can only liberate themselves and all working people through the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Engels, along with Marx, participated in the founding and development of the great theory of scientific socialism and in guiding the international working-class movement for nearly forty years. In 1844, Engels and Marx met for the first time. From then until Marx's death (1883), Engels was Marx's comrade and friend. Moreover, after Marx's death, he was the successor to Marx's cause. Engels always very correctly placed himself after Marx. He once wrote: "When Marx was alive, I played a supporting role." Lenin once pointed out that Engels' love for Marx when Marx was alive and Engels' remembrance of him after Marx's death were endless.

    Marx and Engels worked extremely hard in elaborating the theory of scientific communism. From the perspective of the interests of the working class, they critically reorganized everything that social science had created before them. They criticized the reactionary German idealist philosophy, the old socialist doctrines limited by the narrow vision of bourgeois society, and the British bourgeois political economy. They created a new worldview—dialectical materialism, which marked a huge turning point in the development of social science and philosophical thought.

    Marx and Engels played the most powerful and active role in organizing the forces of the working class for revolutionary struggle against capitalist enslavement. A salient feature of these two outstanding leaders of the working people was the combination of great theoretical strength and revolutionary practice.

    In 1845, Engels published his "The Condition of the Working Class in England." Even today, this is still one of the best works on the condition and status of workers under capitalism. This book is the result of a detailed study of the lives of workers in Manchester, one of the main industrial centers of England at the time, and other working-class areas in England, and is the result of a study of factory inspectors' reports and rich personal observations. Although this book was written more than a hundred years ago, many parts of it describing intolerable exploitation, the poverty of workers, and crowded and unsanitary living conditions are still valuable today.

    Marx and Engels jointly created one of the famous documents on the working class's struggle for liberation—"The Communist Manifesto."

    Lenin said: "In this book, the new worldview is described in a brilliant, thorough and clear style, including thorough materialism in the field of social life, dialectics as the most complete and profound development view, and the doctrine of class struggle and the world historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat, the creator of a new communist society."

    Since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" co-authored by Marx and Engels, it has been the programmatic document of the workers' movement in various countries and continents.

    Engels also wrote a great work of permanent value—"Anti-Dühring." In this book, he refuted the exaggerated, noisy, and vulgar Dühring doctrine, which had a detrimental effect on the German workers' movement, and described some of the main issues concerning dialectical materialism and the materialist conception of history and scientific communism. "Anti-Dühring" is a classic work on Marxist thought, a work famous for its very rich content. Lenin once pointed out: In this book, "there is an analysis of extremely important issues in the fields of philosophy, natural science and social science."

    "Anti-Dühring" was written under Marx's direct and close cooperation. Marx read the first draft of this book, and Chapter 10 of the section on "Political Economy" was personally written by Marx.

    "Anti-Dühring" not only dealt a fatal blow to Dühring's erroneous and confused views, it also helped to overcome all the ideological wavering of the German Social Democratic Party during the period of 1870 to 1880, and became a handbook for many generations of revolutionary fighters against violence and the rule of exploitation. Equally well-known works by Engels include: "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," and "Dialectics of Nature."

    Marx passed away before completing his major work in his life—"Das Kapital." He published the first volume of "Das Kapital," but failed to complete the remaining volumes. Engels regarded the completion of this great work of his great friend as his supreme duty. He prepared and published the second and third volumes of "Das Kapital." Lenin said: "In fact, these two volumes of "Das Kapital" are the joint work of Marx and Engels. There are many moving examples of friendship in ancient stories. The European proletariat can say that its science was founded by two scholars and fighters, and the relationship between the two of them exceeded the most moving stories about the friendship of the ancients."

    Marx and Engels played a leading role in the establishment of the First International (1864); they most actively participated in guiding the work of the First International. Engels actively participated in drafting all the decisive documents of the First International. After the First International ceased its activities, the task of Marx and Engels in guiding the international working-class movement actually increased, because they had to replace the central organization that used to issue instructions to revolutionary leaders in various countries. After Marx's death, Engels continued to be the recognized head, advisor, and leader of all socialists in Europe. People consulted him, Russian revolutionaries and German Social Democrats, leaders of British and American workers' groups, and socialists in Spain and Romania wrote to him for guidance. A great number of letters and many articles and materials prove that Engels played an active role in everything related to the international working-class movement.

    Engels waged a resolute struggle against opportunism in the working-class movement. He vigorously criticized opportunists for abandoning the idea of ​​the dictatorship of the proletariat. He fought to establish a new International on what he called "the basis of pure communism." Engels hoped that the theoretical basis of the new international workers' alliance should be a program of working class struggle on an international scale. He fiercely criticized the leaders of the French Workers' Party, Guesde and Lafargue, for being cowardly and hesitant to convene a new international socialist congress when conditions were ripe. He fiercely criticized the leaders of German Social Democracy, Liebknecht and Bebel, for reconciling with the opportunists. Engels relentlessly denounced the leaders of the so-called Social Democratic Federation of Great Britain, Hyndman and others, for worshiping British conservatives and liberals and for pursuing bourgeois policies in the working-class movement. In a letter to Sorge, he wrote: "The most disgusting thing here is the bourgeois decency that has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the workers. For example, I cannot fully believe that John Burns is not secretly proud of his prestige among Cardinal Manning, Lord Mayor, and the general bourgeoisie, and that he is not proud of his prestige in his own class."

    Engels used these words to denounce the dangerous disease spread among the leaders of working-class organizations, which manifested itself in humiliating self-abasement in front of the ruling bourgeoisie.

    This is the outline of the image of Engels, the indomitable fighter for the cause of the working class and the great teacher of the proletariat.

    ★ ★ ★

    However, some shortcomings that occasionally occurred in Engels' many great and multifaceted activities—activities aimed at arming the working people of all countries with a militant revolutionary theory, activities aimed at consolidating the strength of the proletariat, and activities aimed at exposing and criticizing opportunism in the working-class movement—should also be mentioned. For example, Engels' judgment on the role played by the family in the process of social development is incorrect. In the preface to his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," Engels said something different from what he said about the issue of historical materialism and different from Marx's famous doctrine on the decisive significance of the mode of production in social life; Engels said: "The various social systems in which people in a certain historical era and a certain country live are determined by two kinds of production, on the one hand, determined by the stage of development of labor, and on the other hand, determined by the stage of development of the family." Therefore, he affirmed that the development of society is determined by two beginnings: social production and family development. This is of course incorrect. Stalin, in his work "Dialectical and Historical Materialism," proved absolutely clearly that geographical environment and population are not, and cannot be, the determining factors in social development. The basic factors that determine the various social systems, the social appearance, the nature of social systems, and the change from one system to another in various historical periods are the modes of production of the material materials necessary for social survival and development. The form of the family in a society is determined by the mode of production and changes with changes in the mode of production.

    The last stage of Engels' life corresponded to the period of transition from the early stage of monopoly capitalism to the nearly complete period of imperialism. Engels foresaw the possibility of the outbreak of a world war, but he did not see the imperialist nature of this future war. In his judgment on the future world war, he believed that only Tsarist Russia was the main and fundamental center of the danger of war. He ignored one of the most important factors in the future war, namely: the contradiction between Great Britain and Germany, which was clearly visible at the end of the nineteenth century, when, on the one hand, the plundering activities of German capitalism had reached its peak, and on the other hand, the colonial activities of British and French capitalism. Engels' erroneous position in estimating the causes of a possible world war was most fully revealed in his essay "The Foreign Policy of the Russian Tsarist Regime" and in a series of letters—especially the letter written to the Romanian socialist Nădejde. Engels' erroneous view of the future war was later widely used by the opportunist leaders of the German Social Democratic Party to defend their treasonous chauvinist stance in the war from 1914 to 1918. Stalin's historical work was to openly and frankly criticize the shortcomings in Engels' essay "The Foreign Policy of the Russian Tsarist Regime" and point out that these shortcomings had their practical significance, because these shortcomings contributed to the crime committed by the German Social Democrats on August 4, 1914, when they voted in favor of war expenses and declared the slogan of defending the bourgeois motherland. It should also be pointed out that Engels, in analyzing the revolutionary events of 1848, mistakenly estimated the future of certain Slavic nations, especially the Czech nation.

    ★ ★ ★

    At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, a new era emerged—the era of capitalism and proletarian revolution. It was Lenin and Stalin who continued the cause of Marx and Engels in this new historical era. They thoroughly analyzed the era of imperialism as the highest and final stage of capitalist development. They enriched Marxism with the new theory of socialist revolution and the doctrine of the possibility of socialism winning in one country and the impossibility of socialism winning in all countries at the same time. Lenin and Stalin carefully planned and laid the foundation of the Soviet regime, considering it the most suitable form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They discovered and developed the laws of the transition period from capitalism to socialism and the laws of the life and development of socialist society. Based on the basic theories of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin elaborated on the doctrine of the Bolshevik Party as a new type of party, an indispensable condition for winning the proletarian revolution and winning socialism.

    Comrade Stalin developed Lenin's ideas and summarized the world historical significance of the experience of the Soviet system. He created a complete doctrine of the socialist state, solved the problem of the possibility of building communism in the Soviet Union, and also solved the problem of the necessity of preserving the state under the communist system if capitalist encirclement still exists.

    Lenin and Stalin, as true creative Marxists, enriched the revolutionary doctrine of the proletariat with various great new scientific inventions. They started from the fact that Marxism, as a living doctrine, is not immutable. It develops and enriches itself according to the new experience gained in the class struggle. They taught that certain inferences and theories of Marxism that are useful for a certain historical situation must be replaced by new inferences and theories suitable for a new historical stage. They taught that Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism.

    The doctrine of Marxism has never had such great power as it does now in the past. The correctness and vitality of the theory of Marxism-Leninism have been tested in the historical experience of the mass struggle. Since its birth more than a hundred years ago, Marx's doctrine has continued to win victories and is now being accepted by the ever-growing masses of the working people, becoming a great material force.

    The Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and People's China are concrete manifestations of the strength and vitality of Marxism-Leninism. The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism has inspired millions of people in all countries of the world to actively struggle against imperialism and against the criminal aggressors who are trying to throw humanity into the abyss of a new world massacre. Marxism-Leninism is the banner of all fighters fighting for the realization of a new social system without war, exploitation, and oppression, and for the realization of communism.

    In view of the development of world communism, the bourgeois journalists and heads of capitalist countries are panicking and complaining with sad faces that, in the struggle against communism, they have "failed in propaganda campaigns," according to their own words. They insist that this is all because there is not enough money to spend on propaganda, and they say things like "their propagandists are not good enough." The narrow-minded, despicable, and stupid scribblers of the bourgeois newspapers have never thought that the power of communism is based on the fact that communism represents the development of social progress, and the power of communist propaganda lies in its truthfulness. It is based on the laws of social development and political struggle. They have also never thought that the strength of the Communist and Workers' Parties marching in the forefront of the masses lies in the fact that they are armed with the great pointers, the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    恩格斯—伟大的革命的思想家和无产阶级的领袖
    （纪念恩格斯诞辰第一百三十周年）
    编者按：今年十一月二十八日是科学的共产主义的创始人之一的恩格斯一百三十周年诞辰。苏联哲学家米丁为了纪念这位伟大的革命导师，写了这篇论文，发表在“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第一○八期上。这篇论文扼要地叙述了恩格斯在各方面的光辉业绩，给这位无产阶级的伟大革命战士和卓越的科学家的一生画了一个轮廓。作者在这篇论文中指出了恩格斯的许多伟大的多方面的活动当中偶然发生的一些缺点。
    佛里德利赫·恩格斯这个名字是各国工人阶级最爱戴最尊敬的名字之一。恩格斯是一位伟大的革命战士，卓越的科学家和思想家，卡尔·马克思的一位忠诚的战友和朋友，科学的共产主义的创始人之一。
    马克思和恩格斯的工作所具有的历史任务和意义是无法估计的。他们用资本主义制度必然死亡的理论，用工人阶级作为资本主义的掘墓人、作为一切劳动人民在争取新的社会主义社会的斗争中的领导者所担负的历史任务的认识，来武装劳动人民。马克思和恩格斯在历史上第一次科学地证明：社会主义决不是乌托邦主义者和梦想者的空洞的无法实现的观念。他们在历史上第一次证明，这是近代社会和阶级斗争的发展在历史上不可避免的结果。
    马克思和恩格斯教导说：人类社会的历史乃是阶级斗争的历史。工人阶级只有经过革命的无产阶级专政，才能够解放他们自己和一切劳动人民。
    恩格斯和马克思一道，参与创立并发展科学的社会主义的伟大理论，和指导国际工人阶级运动的工作，几乎有四十年之久。在一八四四年，恩格斯和马克思首次见面。从那时起，到马克思逝世时（一八八三年），恩格斯一直是马克思的战友和朋友。而且，马克思逝世后，他又是马克思事业的继承者。恩格斯总是十分正确地把自己放在马克思之后。他曾经写道：“马克思在世时，我演的是配角。”列宁曾经指出：马克思活着的时候恩格斯对他的热爱、和马克思死后恩格斯对他的追念都是无穷无尽的。
    马克思和恩格斯在阐释科学的共产主义的理论中，备极辛劳。他们从工人阶级利益的观点出发，批判地整理了社会科学在他们以前所创造出来的一切东西。他们批判了反动的德国唯心哲学，为资产阶级社会窄狭眼光所局限的、旧式的社会主义学说，和英国的资产阶级政治经济学。他们创造了一个新的世界观——辩证唯物论，这种世界观在社会科学和哲学思想的发展中标志着一个巨大的转折点。
    ★      ★      ★
    马克思和恩格斯在组织工人阶级的力量以进行反资本奴役的革命斗争中，担任了最有力最积极的角色。这两位劳动人民的杰出领袖的一个显著特征，是巨大的理论力量和革命实践的结合。
    在一八四五年，恩格斯发表了他的《英国工人阶级的状况》。一直到今天，这还是论述在资本主义下工人的状况和地位的最好的著作之一。这本著作是对当时英国主要工业中心之一——曼彻斯特和英国其他工人区域的工人生活进行详细研究的结果，是对工厂视察员的报告和丰富的私人观察所得进行研究的结果。虽然这本著作是在一百多年前写的，但是其中描述不可忍受的剥削、工人的穷困，和拥挤与不卫生的生活条件等许多部分，到现在仍然有价值。
    马克思和恩格斯共同创作了关于工人阶级争取解放斗争的著名文件之一——《共产党宣言》。
    列宁说：“在这部著作里，用天才的透彻鲜明的笔调叙述了新的世界观，包括社会生活领域在内的彻底的唯物论，作为最完备最精深的发展观的辩证法，关于阶级斗争和共产主义新社会创造者——无产阶级所负全世界历史革命使命的学说。”
    自从马克思和恩格斯合著的《共产党宣言》发表以来，它一直是各国和各洲工人运动的纲领文件。
    恩格斯还写了一本有永久价值的伟大作品——《反杜林论》。他在这本书里，驳斥了夸大、喧闹而庸俗的、对于德国工人运动发生恶劣影响的杜林学说，叙述关于辩证唯物论和关于历史与科学的共产主义的唯物观念的一些主要问题。《反杜林论》是一部关于马克思主义思想的经典著作，是一部以其非常丰富的内容而出名的著作。列宁曾经指出：在这本书里，“有着对于哲学、自然科学和社会科学领域中的极端重要的问题的分析”。
    《反杜林论》是在马克思的直接与密切合作之下写成的。马克思读过这本著作的初稿，书中论“政治经济”部分的第十章是马克思亲自撰写的。
    《反杜林论》不仅给予杜林的错误的与混乱的观点以致命的打击，它还帮助克服了德国社会民主党在一八七○到一八八○年期间所有的思想上的摇摆不定，而且成为许多世代的反对暴力、与剥削的统治的革命战士的手册。同样为人周知的恩格斯的作品还有：《家族、私有财产及国家之起源》，《费尔巴哈论》，《自然辩证法》。
    马克思在完成他的一生中的主要作品——《资本论》之前就逝世了。他出版了《资本论》的第一卷，但是未能完成其余的各卷。恩格斯把完成他的伟大友人的这部伟大著作看作他的至高无上的职责。他筹备并且出版了《资本论》的二、三两卷。列宁说：“实在讲，《资本论》的这两卷是马克思和恩格斯的共同作品。古代的故事中有许多动人的友谊的例子。欧洲的无产阶级可以这样说：它的科学是两位学者和战士创立的，他们两位之间的相互关系超过了最动人的关于古人友谊的故事。”
    马克思与恩格斯对于第一国际（一八六四年）的成立起了领导的作用；他们最积极地参加指导第一国际的工作。恩格斯曾积极地参加草拟第一国际一切决定作用的文件。当第一国际停止活动之后，马克思与恩格斯指导国际工人阶级运动的任务实际上就增加了，因为他们必须代替过去向各国革命领袖发布指令的中心机构。在马克思逝世后，恩格斯继续成为欧洲一切社会主义者公认的首脑、顾问和领袖。人们向他请教，俄国革命者与德国社会民主党人，英美工人团体领袖及西班牙与罗马尼亚的社会主义者向他写信请求指导。有极多的信件及许多文章与材料证明恩格斯对于一切有关国际工人阶级运动的事情都起了积极的作用。
    恩格斯进行了坚决的斗争，反对工人阶级运动中发生的机会主义。他猛力批评机会主义者放弃无产阶级专政的思想。他为了在他所称为“纯共产主义的基础”上建立一个新的国际而奋斗。恩格斯的希望是：新的国际工人联盟的理论基础应该是国际规模的工人阶级斗争的纲领。他猛烈批评法国工人党领袖格斯德与拉发格在条件成熟时懦弱迟疑不敢召开新的国际社会主义者大会。他猛烈批评德国社会民主主义领袖李卜克内西与倍倍尔与机会主义者调和。恩格斯无情地斥责所谓大不列颠社会民主联合会的领袖海德曼及其他人，因为他们崇拜英国保守党人和自由党人，因为他们在工人阶级运动中奉行资产阶级的政策。在致索基的信中，他写道：“这里最可厌恶的东西是已经深入工人心中的资产阶级的体面。例如，我不能完全相信约翰·彭斯不是私下以自己在红衣主教曼宁、梅耶勋爵及一般资产阶级中有威望为荣，而不是以他在自己阶级中的威望自豪。”
    恩格斯用这些话斥责在工人阶级组织领袖中传布的危险的疾病，其表现就在统治的资产阶级面前屈辱自卑。
    这就是工人阶级事业的不屈不挠的斗士、无产阶级的伟大导师——恩格斯的容貌的轮廓。
    ★      ★        ★
    但是，恩格斯的许多伟大而多方面的活动——目的在把一个战斗性的革命理论武装各国劳动人民而进行的活动，为巩固无产阶级力量而进行的活动，为暴露和批评工人阶级运动中的机会主义而进行的活动——当中偶尔发生的一些缺点，也应该说一说。例如，恩格斯对于家族在社会发展过程中所起的作用这个问题的判断是错误的。在他的《家族、私有财产及国家之起源》一书的序文里，恩格斯所说的话，不同于他对于历史唯物论这个问题所说的其他的话，也不同于马克思关于生产方式在社会生活中所起的决定意义的有名学说；恩格斯说：“一个一定的历史时代和一个一定的国家里的人在其中生存的各种社会制度，是决定于两种生产，一方面决定于劳动发展的阶段，另一方面决定于家族发展的阶段。”因此，他肯定：社会的发展决定于两个开端：社会生产与家族发展。这当然是不正确的，斯大林在他的著作《辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义》中，绝对清晰地证明地理的环境和人口都不是，而且也不能是社会发展中的决定因素。决定各个不同的历史时期的各种社会制度，社会面貌，社会制度的性质以及从一个制度变化到另一个制度的基本因素，是生产社会生存和发展所必需的物质资料的生产方式。一个社会中家族的形式决定于生产方式，并且随着生产方式的变化而改变。
    恩格斯一生最后的一个阶段相当于独占资本主义时代的前期过渡到帝国主义将近完成的一个时期。恩格斯预见到一次世界大战爆发的可能性，但他没有看出这一未来战争的帝国主义性质。在他关于未来世界战争的判断中，他认为只有帝俄是战争危险的主要和基本的中心。他忽略了未来战争中的一个最主要的因素，即是：大不列颠与德国之间的矛盾，这种矛盾在十九世纪末叶已很明显地看得出来，当时一方面是德国资本主义劫掠活动已到了登峰造极的时期，另一方面是英法资本主义的殖民活动。恩格斯在估计可能发生一次世界大战的原因时所持的错误立场，曾在他的一篇论文“俄国沙皇制度的外交政策”以及一系列的书信——特别是写给罗马尼亚社会主义者纳节日达的信里，最充分地表露出来。恩格斯的这种关于未来战争的错误见解，后来被德国社会民主党的机会主义的领袖们广泛地利用来辩护他们在一九一四年至一九一八年的战争中的叛逆的沙文主义的立场。斯大林所做的一件历史性的工作，是他公开地坦率地批评了恩格斯的“俄国沙皇制度的外交政策”的论文里的缺点，并指出这些缺点有它们的实际意义，因为这些缺点助长了德国社会民主党人在一九一四年八月四日所犯的罪恶，当时他们投票赞成作战费用，并宣布保卫资产阶级祖国的口号。还应该指出的一点是恩格斯在分析一八四八年的革命事变时，错误地估计了某些斯拉夫民族，特别是捷克民族的前途。
    ★    ★      ★
    在十九世纪末和二十世纪初，产生了一个新时代——资本主义和无产阶级革命的时代。在这个新的历史时代里继续进行马克思和恩格斯的事业的是列宁和斯大林。他们认为帝国主义的时代是资本主义发展的最高、最后的一个阶段，他们把它透彻地加以分析。他们把社会主义革命这个新的理论以及关于社会主义在一个国家胜利的可能性、与社会主义不可能在所有国家同时胜利的学说来丰富了马克思主义。列宁和斯大林精心规划出并奠定了苏维埃政权的基础，认为这是无产阶级专政的最为适宜的形式，他们发现了并发展了从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的规律和社会主义社会的生活和发展的规律。列宁和斯大林凭着马克思和恩格斯的基本学说，详细地订出关于布尔什维克党，作为争取无产阶级革命胜利，争取社会主义胜利的一个不可或缺的条件的新型政党的学说。
    斯大林同志发展了列宁的思想，总结了苏维埃制度的经验的世界历史意义，他创造了完整的关于社会主义国家的学说，解决了在苏联建设完成共产主义的可能性问题，同时也解决了如果资本主义包围依然存在，在共产主义制度下，国家仍有保存之必要的问题。
    作为真正的创造性马克思主义者的列宁和斯大林，用种种伟大的新的科学发明，充实了无产阶级的革命学说。他们是从这个事实出发的，即：作为一种活的学说的马克思主义，并不是一成不变的，它按照阶级斗争中获得的新经验而发展、充实。他们教导说：马克思主义的对于某一个历史的情况是有用的某些推论和理论，必须用适合于一个新历史阶段的新的推论和理论来代替。他们教导说：马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。
    马克思主义的学说在过去任何时期都没有像现在这样伟大的力量。马列主义的理论的正确性和生命力已经在群众斗争的历史经验中受过考验了。马克思学说自从在一百多年前产生以来，不断地赢得胜利，现在正在被日益广大的劳动人民大众所接受，已经成为一个伟大的物质力量。
    苏联，各人民民主国家和人民中国就是马列主义的力量和生命力的具体表现。马列主义的学说鼓舞了全世界一切国家里千百万人民起来，对帝国主义、对竭力要把人类投入一个新的世界屠杀的深渊中去的罪恶的侵略者们进行积极的斗争。马列主义是一切为实现没有战争、剥削和压迫的新社会制度、为实现共产主义而斗争的战士的旗帜。
    资本主义国家的资产阶级新闻记者们和首脑们，鉴于世界共产主义的发展，恐惶万状，哭丧着脸抱怨说：在反对共产主义的斗争中，按他们自己的说法，他们“在宣传运动方面是失败了”，他们硬说这全是因为没有足够的钱用在宣传上的原故，并说些“他们的宣传家都是不高明的”之类的话。资产阶级报纸的头脑偏狭的、卑劣的、愚蠢的文丐却从没有想到共产主义的力量是基于这事实，即：共产主义代表着社会进步的发展，共产主义宣传的力量在于它的真实性，它是根据社会发展和政治斗争的规律的。他们也从没有想到在群众的前列迈进的共产党和工人党的力量是在于这个事实，即：他们是用伟大的指针，不可战胜的马、恩、列、斯的学说武装起来的。
