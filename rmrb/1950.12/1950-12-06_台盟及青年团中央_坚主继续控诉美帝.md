    Taiwan Democratic League and Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
    Firmly Advocate Continuing to Accuse U.S. Imperialism
    [Report from this newspaper] The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a declaration on December 4th, stating its firm support for the speech by Wu Hsiu-chuan, the specially appointed representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council. The declaration is as follows:
    Our country’s representative, Wu Hsiu-chuan's speech at the United Nations Security Council, accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, fully represents the firm will of the Chinese people to oppose American aggression and reflects the just call of the world for peace. The Chinese people, especially the people of Taiwan under the aggression of U.S. imperialism, resolutely support this speech.
    Whether in law or in fact, Taiwan is Chinese territory, this is an ironclad fact. What exists in Taiwan now is not a question of status, but the problem of the United States' armed aggression against our country's territory—Taiwan. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism. We, the people of Taiwan, have consistently demanded a return to the embrace of the motherland, and we resolutely oppose anyone preventing our urgent demand.
    The three proposals put forward by Representative Wu Hsiu-chuan in his accusation are the cornerstone of guaranteeing Asian peace and security and the only concrete plan for striving for world peace. However, U.S. imperialism used its majority voting machine to veto this proposal. This once again nakedly exposed the true face of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Chinese territory. We express our anger and contempt for this illegal veto. We will continue our accusations against U.S. imperialism.
    From the late Ming Dynasty to the present, for more than three hundred years, the people of Taiwan have continuously demonstrated a strong patriotic spirit and an anti-aggression revolutionary tradition. The people of Taiwan are determined to step up unity, fight to the end with the people of the whole country to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression, and strive for the early liberation of Taiwan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League issued the following statement regarding the accusation made by our representative Wu Hsiu-chuan at the Security Council against the United States for aggression against Taiwan:
    All members of the China New Democratic Youth League resolutely support the solemn accusation made by Wu Hsiu-chuan, the representative of the People's Republic of China, at the Security Council against the United States for aggression against Taiwan. This accusation represents the just demands of the Chinese people and is a document in the diplomatic history of China in the last century that demonstrates the integrity and national dignity of the Chinese people. This righteously worded indictment has been cheered by peace-loving people all over the world and has made the U.S. imperialists extremely embarrassed, having no other response than to use the voting machine to make a shameless veto. But the Chinese people will never tolerate the unreasonable veto of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states. We completely despise this veto, and we will continue to accuse the U.S. imperialist aggression. We will continue to put forward the demands we have already made. Taiwan is China's, and we will of course prepare to liberate it at any time. The mad provocations and aggression of the U.S. imperialist group against the Chinese people must be stopped. We, along with the people of all China, are determined and fully confident that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we will defeat all imperialists who dare to invade China.

    台盟及青年团中央
    坚主继续控诉美帝
    【本报讯】台湾民主自治同盟于十二月四日发表宣言，表示坚决拥护我国出席联合国安全理事会特派代表伍修权的发言，宣言如下：
    我国代表伍修权在联合国安全理事会上，控诉美国武装侵略台湾的发言，充分地代表了中国人民反对美国侵略的坚强意志，并反映了全世界要求和平的正义呼声。中国人民，尤其是在美帝侵略下的台湾人民坚决拥护并支持这一个发言。
    台湾不论在法律上和事实上都是中国的领土，这是铁一般的事实。现在所存在于台湾的并不是什么地位问题，而是美国武装侵略我国领土——台湾的问题。中国人民对美帝的这种强盗行为是绝不能容忍的。我们台湾人民自始至终要求重归祖国的怀抱，我们坚决反对任何人来阻止我们这一个迫切的要求。
    伍修权代表在控诉中所提出的三个建议是保证亚洲和平和安全的基石，也是争取世界和平的唯一具体方案。但美帝利用他的多数表决器否决了这个建议。这再一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝侵略中国领土的真面目。我们对这一个非法否决表示愤怒和蔑视。我们将要继续我们对美帝的控诉。
    自明末到现在这三百多年当中，台湾人民不断地表现出强烈的爱国精神和反侵略的革命传统。台湾人民誓必加紧团结，为反对美帝侵略，争取台湾的早日解放，与全国人民奋斗到底。
    【新华社五日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会就我国代表伍修权在安理会所提出的对美国侵略台湾的控诉发表声明如下：
    中国新民主主义青年团全体青年团员坚决拥护中华人民共和国代表伍修权在安理会对美国侵略台湾的庄严控诉。这一控诉代表着中国人民的正义要求，是近百年中国外交史中表现了中国人民正气和民族尊严的文献。这一义正辞严的控诉状，已经获得全世界爱好和平的人民的欢呼，已经使得美帝国主义者万分狼狈，除了使用表决机器作无耻的否决外，更无辞答辩。但是中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义和他的仆从国家的无理否决，我们对这种否决完全加以蔑视，对美帝的侵略罪行，我们要继续控诉。我们已提出的要求，还要继续提出。台湾是中国的，我们当然要准备随时加以解放；美帝国主义集团对中国人民疯狂的挑衅和侵略，必须制止。我们和全中国人民一道，有决心也有充分的信心在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，打败敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义者。
