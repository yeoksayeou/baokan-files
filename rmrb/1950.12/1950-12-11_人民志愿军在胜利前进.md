People's Volunteer Army Advances Victoriously
By Our Special Correspondent, Li Wei

(1) The Korean People Fight Heroically Amidst Hardship

We were advancing rapidly southward under the moonlight. Along both sides of the road, groups of twos and threes of Korean refugees walked towards us. They were wearing white, unlined clothing. Some women had bundles on their heads, and babies wrapped in quilts on their backs. They looked with surprise at this indistinctly seen armed force. These people, worried about their country, were seeking shelter in the northern mountains from the enemy’s frantic attacks. When they realized that it was the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army that had come, they put down their heavy burdens, sighed, and looked back. We could only understand everything in the hearts of these neighbors, whose language we did not speak, from this action.

We made camp. Although we could not communicate verbally, the Korean people were deeply moved by the Volunteer soldiers’ peaceful actions, the fact that most were sleeping in the cold fields, and that even if a horse kicked a stone and broke a jar during the march, they would pay for it. Unable to converse in words, some Korean people wrote on a piece of paper: "Our leader is Kim Il-sung," and we wrote: "Our leader is Mao Zedong." Ah! Mao Zedong! What a resounding name! The Korean people were happy, they shouted, and grasped our hands tightly, saying: "Kamsahamnida! Kamsahamnida!" (Thank you! Thank you!) Especially after the Korean comrades in the Volunteer Army explained in detail, they understood even more that the Chinese people were extending a helping hand in times of trouble with such sublime friendship, and were fighting shoulder to shoulder with them at the cost of blood and lives. This "thank you" was not only expressing their personal feelings, but representing the Korean nation and people.

The Korean farmers in the mountains eat porridge made from broken corn kernels and soybeans to fill their stomachs, and wrap large quantities of grain in straw bags, carry them on yellow oxen or pull them on "pallisade carts" (a kind of sled, also common in rural Northeast China) and send them to the front lines. One night, we went to a meeting in another place and encountered a convoy of grain carriers along the way. Those participating in the grain transport included the elderly, old women, and even young women and children.

Almost all the young men had joined the People's Army to fight to defend their country and the life under the people's democratic regime. The majority of those remaining in the villages were women, children, and the elderly. Some elderly people did the unfinished autumn harvest work at home every day, while women and children repaired roads every day. They held all available primitive tools in their hands - sickles, small axes, shovels, hoes, and even small knives, and braved the daytime air raids of American aircraft to repair the roads damaged by enemy planes, and fill in the ditches along the mountain roads in order to widen the roads so that passing vehicles could pass each other, keeping the traffic of this blood vessel serving the war unobstructed. The members of the "Women's Alliance" (women's federation) in the village participated in the "Repair Team" and "Grain Transportation Team," and participated in guarding the post to check roads and capture special agents.

The inhumane American planes circled, bombed, and strafed on the highways day and night, dropped bombs, fired machine guns, and set off incendiary bombs on the small houses of peaceful residents in the mountain gullies, causing the mountains behind the northern Korean front to burn. However, it cannot conquer the Korean people. Such a tenacious and extraordinary people cannot be defeated!

(2) How Were the Two Great Victories Won?

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army participates in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country on a voluntary basis. We understand that we are acting for the security of our country, for the fate of the Asian people, and for the consolidation of the friendship between the two great nations of China and Korea.

We use our two legs to cross mountains and rivers and fight against the enemy with modern equipment. However, the Volunteer soldiers know that US imperialism is just a paper tiger. It poses as a tiger, baring its fangs and claws, but in fact it is a "embroidered pillow" - a useless bag of straw! The basic reason is that the war of resistance against US aggression and defense of our country that we and the Korean people are engaged in is a just war, while the enemy is engaged in a war of aggression that attempts to turn history backwards.

When the Korean people began to come into contact with us, and saw this "ordinary" attire and "ordinary" equipment, they did not dare to easily believe whether this force could be a new force to turn the tide. However, after the first campaign in North Korea from October 25th to November 8th, in which they jointly annihilated more than 13,000 enemies with the People's Army, the people completely believed in this force.

And what about the enemy? They looked at the problem from a different perspective. When the two regiments of the puppet Lee army's 6th Division that had sneaked into Chosan were cut off and surrounded, the "Voice of America" was still shouting that "it is certain to pick up these two regiments to break through," and the commander of the US 24th Division, Church, was still directing his troops to rush from Taecheon to Guseong to Sakju, shouting something like "It would be strange if we don't reach the Yalu River in a day or two!" However, the decisive battle around Unsan shattered the US imperialist's "bold words" that they would "completely occupy Korea by Thanksgiving on November 23rd!" And November 1st, the day the US imperialists planned to advance to the Yalu River on all fronts, became the memorial day for the funeral of three battalions of the US Cavalry First Division in the Battle of Unsan!

In this battle, one of our infantry companies annihilated an entire US company alone, and another infantry company annihilated an entire puppet army company while suffering only one casualty. The infantry who participated in the Battle of Unsan suffered from inconvenient transportation and supply, and the food supply was not available. They fought this victory by drinking porridge, eating pumpkins, gnawing on corn cobs, and even fighting on empty stomachs. The soldiers of a certain artillery unit who participated in the Battle of Unsan prepared shells with good fuses so that they could be sent to the enemy's tanks by people. They shot down two American F-84E jet aircraft and damaged two others. Our infantry used hand grenades and explosives to destroy enemy tanks, and even climbed onto tanks to open the hatches and destroy them. The enemy was beaten into a frenzy, like a group of frightened ducks, abandoning cars, artillery, heavy weapons, climbing up the mountains, and burrowing into the forests. Our army had to send out troops to search the mountains and capture prisoners, like "monkeys catching lice," picking out those cowardly ghosts who were both frozen and hungry from the post-war mountains and forests one by one.

Even the American advisors in the puppet army had to say after being captured: "Your tactics have never been seen in history."

However, MacArthur, this muddle-headed war monger, still could not learn a lesson all at once. After the collapse in the first campaign, he was still saying that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army "is by no means unworthy of contempt." He had not suffered enough losses to make him accept the lesson. He still believed that his frontline commander was very "wise" and timely withdrew the army that was originally planned to rush directly to the Chinese border. Therefore, this typical American fascist fool launched the so-called "Christmas homecoming" "general offensive" on November 24th, attempting to reach the Yalu River in one fell swoop, and then implement the next step of his plan to conquer China and conquer Asia.

The bragging of this clumsy disciple of Hitler was shattered by the counterattack of the People's Army only twenty-four hours later! As I write this report, drastic changes are taking place on the Korean battlefield - the enemy on the western front has completely collapsed, and has been divided and shattered by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Along the mountain roads south of the Cheongcheon River through Deokcheon, Unsan, and Bokcheon, the mechanized heavy equipment of the Golden Yuan imperialism is abandoned everywhere, and the soldiers of the invaders, who do not know why they are fighting, are running all over the mountains, and the stragglers of the enemy army at the rear are fleeing towards Pyongyang. Several divisions and regiments of the enemy on the eastern front are being divided, surrounded and annihilated, and the enemy has to use "spiral" helicopters to evacuate the wounded or some commanders.

(3) Morale of the US Army as Seen from US POWs

A comrade who was sent to do prisoner-of-war work brought a letter written by American prisoners of war. This letter was written on "Thanksgiving Day" on November 23rd, signed by ten prisoners of war and led by an American prisoner of war named Waiter AHutton. The translation is as follows:

"To express our gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we, the undersigned, have written this letter. We have been their prisoners since November 5, 1950.

"After surrendering to them, their officers and soldiers have paid great attention to our safety and health. They have given medicine to our wounded and provided us all with sufficient food and comfortable places. Officers and soldiers share their own cigarettes and food with us, and they strive to care for each of us at all times."

This letter was earned by our actual actions. On November 5th, we only discovered them during the cleanup of the battlefield in Unsan. They had been deceived by propaganda that the People's Army killed every captured enemy soldier, so they did not dare to surrender. When they first became prisoners, they were shaking in their boots. During one day of action, we did not reach the garrison, and our people only had six dry rations, but took out five of them to share with the prisoners. The prisoners were placed in small houses with heated Korean beds, and ate the same food as our guard troops and staff. When they didn't have American cigarettes to smoke, they used corn husks and sorghum stalks as cigarettes, and the soldiers shared their few yellow cigarettes with them. The medics applied medicine to those who were injured. The staff refused to accept the beautiful leather cigarette cases they gave as gifts, and explained to them every day the things they were surprised about - they were "surprised" that the US imperialists used guns and cannons to arm Chiang Kai-shek to kill the Chinese people, and that American capitalists drove them to invade others!

An American prisoner of war named Robert.I. Wood, who had just graduated from the History Department of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., enlisted three days after his marriage. He said that because he attended university on public funding, he had to sign a "contract" with his "country" to serve in the army for three years after graduation before doing other things. He was tricked into coming to Korea to be a "police officer" of the "United Nations." A seventeen-year-old child named Vana Digan also joined the army because he couldn't make a living, and his mother sent him to the army for a salary of fifty US dollars a month. He said he thought being a soldier was "fun" to go to Japan and Korea, but he didn't expect to fight - and of course, he didn't expect to be a prisoner!

Once we held a symposium, and the composition of the eleven American prisoners of war who participated was as follows: seven workers, two farmers, one university student, and one doctor; not a single son of a capitalist! Why are they fighting? Who are they fighting for? Who are they fighting against? All are question marks. They hope to publish their names and send letters to the United States so that their families know that they are still alive. They want our photographers to take a group photo of them, preferably to be sent to the United States and published in a newspaper so that their relatives can see them, so they stare intently at the reporter's lens. They hope to be released and return directly to the United States and never go to the army again. They said that after going back, they would rather go to jail than serve in the military. The oldest one, the doctor Walter Hutton, who was called "Dad" by the prisoners, said that he wanted to be a good doctor...

On November 5th, we received four South Korean prisoners sent by a certain regiment after being interrogated by sentries. They were all wearing American-style single uniforms, some had changed into white, unlined pants, and carried identity cards issued by the South Korean puppet government. However, they initially refused to admit that they were puppet soldiers. Later, one of them, after being taken care of, eating, sitting on a heated bed, drinking hot water, and smoking, was so moved that he cried. It turned out that he was a driver from a certain place in Gangwon Province. His brother was killed by the puppet army, his nephew joined the People's Guerrilla, and he was captured to be a soldier and fight for the Americans. In this way, all four admitted that they were from the 8th Regiment of the 6th Division of the puppet army. After they fully understood the Korean situation and the nature of the war, they expressed their desire to take revenge on the American aggressors and their lackeys - the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee!

How can such an army, organized by such people, even though equipped with airplanes, tanks, artillery, cars, and carbines, and engaged in such an unclear war, not be defeated?

This is the real content wrapped in the tiger skin of the "paper tiger"!

    人民志愿军在胜利前进
    本报特约通讯员  李伟
    （一）朝鲜人民在艰苦中英勇战斗
    我们在月光下向南疾进着。沿着公路两侧，迎面走来三三两两的朝鲜难民，他（她）们穿着白色的单衣，有些女人头上顶着包裹，背上背着裹在被子里的婴儿，他（她）们用惊奇的眼光看着这支看不大清楚的武装的队伍。这些为祖国耽忧的人民，在敌人疯狂进攻之下，向着北方的山沟里找寻栖身之所。当看出来这是由中国人民组织起来的志愿军到来的时候，他（她）们放下沉重的行囊，叹一口气，回头望一望。我们只能从这个动作上去理解这言语不通的邻居心里所想的一切。
    宿营了。虽然言语不通，但是朝鲜人民看到志愿战士们安祥的动作，大部露宿在风寒的野地，甚至马在行进中蹬动了石头打坏的罐子都要赔钱，深深地感动了。不能用语言交谈，有的朝鲜人民在纸条上写道：“我们的领导金日成”，我们就写：“我们的领导毛泽东”。啊！毛泽东！这是多么响亮的名字啊！朝鲜人民高兴了，叫起来了，紧握着我们的手，说着：“考马不斯米大！考马不斯米大！”（谢谢！谢谢）特别是经过志愿部队中朝鲜籍的同志们详加解释之后，他们更加了解了：中国人民是用这样最崇高的友情，在患难中伸出援手，以鲜血生命的代价来和他们并肩作战来了。这个“谢谢”，不仅是表达他们个人的感情，而是代表着朝鲜的国家和民族。
    山地里的朝鲜农民，吃着用玉蜀黍的破粒和黄豆煮的粥来充饥，而把大批粮食用稻草包包起来，用黄牛驮上或用“爬犁”（一种雪橇，我国东北农村也很多）拉上，送往前线。有一天夜晚，我们去另外一个地方开会，沿途就遇着送粮队的行列。参加送粮的有老人，老妇，甚至年青的妇女和小孩。
    年青的男子差不多都去参加人民军，为保卫祖国和人民民主政权下的生活而战斗去了；村里剩下的大部分是女人、小孩和老年人。一些老年人每天在家做秋收未完的劳作，女人们、孩子们每天白天去修路。她们手里拿着一切可以利用的原始工具——镰刀、小斧子、铲子、锹，甚至小刀，大白天冒着美机的空袭，去修补被敌机炸坏的公路，填平蜿蜒在大山上的公路侧的水沟，以便加宽公路，使来往车辆得以错车，保持这为战争服务的输血管的交通畅行无阻。村中的“女性同盟”（妇女会）的盟员们参加了“修复队”、“运粮队”，参加站岗查路捉特务。
    惨无人道的美国飞机，在公路上空不分昼夜地盘旋轰炸扫射，向山沟里和平居民的小房子上投掷炸弹，打机关炮，放烧夷弹，使北部朝鲜战线后面的大山都在燃烧。然而，它征服不了朝鲜的人民。这样艰苦卓绝的人民是不可被战胜的！
    （二）两大胜仗是怎样打的？
    中国人民志愿部队是在志愿的基础之上参加抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争；我们懂得，我们是为祖国的安全、为亚洲人民的命运、为中朝两大民族的巩固的友谊而行动着。
    我们是用两条腿去翻山过河，和那近代化装备的敌人作战。然而志愿战士们知道美帝是只纸老虎，它摆着一只老虎的架子，张牙舞爪，其实是不堪一击的“绣花枕头”——草包！这个基本的原因在于：我们和朝鲜人民所从事的抗美卫国战争是正义的战争，而敌人则是从事企图把历史向后拉回转去的侵略战争。
    当朝鲜人民开始接触我们，看到这“平凡”的装束和“平凡”的装备，还不敢轻易相信这支力量能否作为挽转危局的生力军。但是，经过自十月二十五日至十一月八日的北朝第一个战役，与人民军共同歼敌一万三千多人之后，人民完全相信这支力量了。
    而敌人呢？他们是从另外一个角度看问题的。当窜到楚山的伪李军第六师的两个团被切断而陷入包围的时候，“美国之音”还在叫唤“有把握接应这两个团突围”，美第二十四师师长邱奇还在指挥他的部队从泰川到龟城奔向朔州，叫喊什么“一两天到不了鸭绿江才怪呢！”然而，在云山一带的决战，便把美帝“十一月二十三日感恩节全部占领朝鲜”的“豪语”粉碎了！而十一月一日这个美帝预定全线推进到鸭绿江边的日子，成为云山战斗美骑兵第一师三个营的葬礼纪念节了！
    在这一战役中，我们有一个步兵连单独全歼美军一个连，另外一个步兵连全歼一个伪军连而自己仅伤亡一人。参加云山战斗的步兵曾因交通供应不便，粮食接济不上，喝稀饭、吃南瓜，啃苞米棒子，甚至饿着肚子打了这个胜仗。参加云山战斗的炮兵某部战士们，准备好了上好引信的炮弹，以便用人送到敌人的坦克上。他们打掉了美国Ｆ八四Ｅ式喷气式飞机两架，打伤其两架。我们的步兵用手榴弹，用炸药去炸毁敌人的坦克，甚至爬上坦克揭盖打掉它。敌人被打得乱窜，像一群受惊的鸭子，丢下汽车、大炮、重武器，向山上爬，向林里钻。我军不得不抽出部队去搜山抓俘虏，像“猴子抓虱子”一样地，从战后的山林里一个一个去剔出那些又冻又饿的胆小鬼们。
    连伪军中的美国顾问都不得不在被俘后说：“你们的战术是在历史上没见过的。”
    但是，麦克阿瑟这个昏了头的战争贩子却一下子还教训不过来。在第一个战役垮台之后，还在那里说中国人民志愿军“绝不是不可轻侮的”。他还没吃到足以使他接受教训的大亏，他还认为他的前线指挥官很“明智”，及时地撤退了原拟直冲到中国边境的军队。因此，这个典型的美国法西斯糊涂虫又在十一月二十四日发动了所谓“圣诞节前回家”的“总攻势”，企图一举攻抵鸭绿江边，而后实施其征服中国征服亚洲的计划的下一步。
    这位希特勒拙劣的门徒吹的牛皮才有二十四小时，就被人民军队的反击打得粉碎了！当我执笔写这篇报道的时候，朝鲜战场上正在起着剧烈的变化——西线敌人已全部崩溃，被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队分割打烂，从德川、云山、博川通过清川江南下的山路上，到处抛弃着金元帝国主义的机械化重装备，满山遍野跑窜着不知道自己为什么打仗的侵略者的士兵，尾巴上的敌军散兵正逃向平壤。东线的敌人若干师、团正被分割包围聚歼，敌人不得不用“螺旋式”的直升飞机撤走伤员或什么司令官。
    （三）从美俘看美军士气
    派去做俘虏工作的一位同志带来一封美国俘虏们写的信。这封信是在十一月二十三日“感恩节”时，十个俘虏签名由一名叫瓦特·Ａ·胡吞（Waiter AHutton）的美俘领衔执笔写的信，翻译出来是这样的：
    “为了表示我们对中国人民志愿部队的谢意，我们下列签名的人写了这一封信。自一九五○年十一月五日起，我们就成为他们的俘虏。
    “对他们投降以后，他们的军官和士兵对我们的安全和健康表示非常注意。对我们受伤的给了药品治疗，并给我们全体以足够的食物和舒适的地方。军官和战士们把他们自己的烟和食物分给我们，他们时时努力地关怀着我们每个人。”
    这封信，是我们的实际行动换来的。十一月五日，我们在云山打扫战场时才发现了冻饿得不能支持的他们。他们受了欺骗宣传，说是人民军杀死每个被俘的敌军，所以不敢投降。开始变成俘虏，还吓得两腿直抖。在一天行动中未赶到驻地，我们的人只带了六个干粮，却拿出五个来给俘虏们合吃。俘虏们被安置在有暖炕的小房子里，和我们的警卫部队及工作人员吃一样的伙食。他们没有美国烟吸了，用苞米叶子，用高粱秸穰子当烟吸，战士们把自己不多的黄烟分给他们。卫生员给他们之中负了伤的上药。工作人员拒绝接受他们赠送的漂亮的皮烟盒，而且每天给他们解释他们所惊奇的事情——他们对于美帝用枪炮武装蒋介石杀中国人民，对于美国资本家驱使他们侵略旁人都感到“惊奇”！
    一个名叫罗伯特·伍德（Robert.I. Wood）的美俘，是才从华盛顿的乔治堂（George Twon）大学历史系毕业的大学生，结婚三天就入伍了。他说由于他上大学是公费，不得不和他的“国家”订了“合同”，毕业后在军队中服务三年再做其他事情。他被骗着说是到朝鲜来当“联合国”的“警察”的。一个名叫万那·狄根（Vana Digan）的十七岁的小孩也参军了，原因是生活不成，妈妈为了一个月五十元美金的薪饷而送他当兵了。他说原以为当兵“好玩”，到日本，到朝鲜，没想到打仗——当然更没想到当俘虏！
    有一次我们召开了一个座谈会，参加的十一名美俘的成份是这样的：工人七，农民二，大学生一，医生一；一个资本家的儿子也没有！他们为什么打仗？他们为谁打仗？他们和谁打仗？都是些问号。他们希望公布他们的名字，寄信到美国去，让家里的人知道他们还活着。他们愿意我们的摄影记者给他们拍一张合照，最好寄到美国，在某一报章上登出来，而且让亲人们看见，所以聚精会神地望着记者的镜头。他们希望释放后直接回到美国，再不要到军队去。他们表示回去之后，宁坐牢也不服兵役了。那位年纪最大的，被俘虏们称为“爸爸”的医生瓦特·胡吞表示，他要好好当个医生……
    十一月五日，我们接收了某团送来的由哨兵查问出来的四个南朝鲜俘虏。他们都穿戴着美式单军服，有的换了一条白色的单裤，身上带着南朝鲜傀儡政府发的身份证。然而，开始坚不承认是伪军。后来其中之一，在经过我们照料吃饭、坐暖炕、喝热水、吸烟之后，被感动得哭起来了。原来他是江原道某地的一个司机手，哥哥被伪军杀死了，侄儿参加了人民游击队，他被抓来当兵，替美国人打仗。这样，四个人全部承认他们是伪军第六师八团的。他们在完全懂得了朝鲜形势和战争性质之后，表示要向美国侵略者及其走狗——朝鲜卖国贼李承晚复仇！
            ×                    ×                        ×
    这样的军队，用这样的人所组织起来的军队，虽然配有飞机、坦克、大炮、汽车、卡宾枪，从事这样不明不白的战争，怎有不打败仗的道理呢？
    这便是“纸老虎”的老虎皮里包着的真实内容！
                              一九五○年十二月二日于朝鲜某地
