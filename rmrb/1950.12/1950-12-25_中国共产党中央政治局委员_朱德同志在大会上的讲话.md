Xinhua News Agency, December 24th:

    Comrades!
    The result of the joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army has been a great victory on the east and west lines of the northern half of Korea. On the 6th of this month, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army liberated Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and continued to expand their gains, chasing the defeated American invading army southward. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I warmly celebrate the victory of the anti-American war of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and pay high tribute to the warriors of the two countries who fought side by side on the Korean front.
    People from all walks of life and all democratic parties throughout the country have unanimously and enthusiastically celebrated the victory on the Korean front, and firmly supported the great struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. This is because this struggle is completely in line with justice, and not only conforms to the common interests of the Chinese and Korean peoples, but also conforms to the common interests of the people of Asia and the world. The victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples has proved a truth to the world, that is: no matter how fierce and rampant imperialist aggression may be temporarily, it is fundamentally isolated and fragile, and therefore can be defeated.
    The victory of the anti-American war of the Chinese and Korean peoples has aroused an unprecedented upsurge in the anti-imperialist movement of the Chinese people. This victory will also arouse a new upsurge in the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Asian countries.
    The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War is the result of the unbridled expansion of aggression by American imperialism. The Chinese people have repeatedly expressed their desire for a peaceful settlement of the Korean War, but the imperialists stubbornly refused a peaceful settlement. We still hope that the Korean War can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. We insist that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea quickly, and Korean internal affairs must be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The American invading army must withdraw from Taiwan. The People's Republic of China must obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations. Only by realizing these demands can the Asian issue be resolved peacefully.
    Lasting peace is the will of millions of people around the world. The World Peace Congress held in Warsaw this time by 1,756 representatives from 80 countries most clearly expressed this will of the people of the world. The declaration to the people of the world and the appeal to the United Nations Organization issued by the World Peace Congress called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, a peaceful end to the Korean War, and put forward a program for striving for world peace, calling on the people of the world to work together to stop the war crisis and demanding the convening of a conference of the five major powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Britain, and the People's Republic of China to discuss a peaceful settlement of all current international issues. These proposals of the Congress are enthusiastically supported by the Chinese people. All democratic parties and people's organizations across the country should mobilize the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of the resolutions of the Warsaw Congress.
    The victory of the Warsaw Congress and the victory on the Korean battlefield are equally a sign of the upsurge of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world, and equally worthy of celebration. The Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, led by Mr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, and including representatives from all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all ethnic groups, and cultural, scientific, artistic, and religious circles, conveyed to the world at this conference the sacred will of the Chinese people to resolutely defend world peace. We celebrate the success of the Warsaw Congress and express our welcome and gratitude to the representatives of the delegation.

    中国共产党中央政治局委员
    朱德同志在大会上的讲话
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国共产党中央政治局委员朱德二十四日在北京各界庆祝中朝人民抗美胜利欢迎和大代表团返国大会的讲话，全文如下：同志们！
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的结果，已经在朝鲜北半部东西两线获得了伟大的胜利。本月六日中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军解放了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤，并继续扩大战果，向南追击正在溃败中的美国侵略军。我代表中国共产党中央委员会，热烈庆祝中朝两国人民抗美战争的胜利，并向在朝鲜前线上并肩作战的中朝两国的勇士们致以崇高的敬意。
    全国各阶层人民和各民主党派都一致热烈庆祝朝鲜前线上的胜利，并坚决支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的伟大斗争。这是因为这一斗争完全合乎正义，不但符合中朝两国人民的共同利益，而且符合全亚洲全世界人民的共同利益。中朝两国人民的胜利向全世界证明了一个真理，这就是：帝国主义的侵略无论暂时怎样凶狠和猖獗，在根本上都是孤立的、脆弱的，因此都是可以打败的。
    中朝两国人民抗美战争的胜利，引起了中国人民反帝国主义运动的空前的高涨。这一胜利将同样引起亚洲各国人民反帝国主义斗争的新高涨。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争，是美帝国主义肆无忌惮地扩大侵略的结果。中国人民曾经再三表示过和平解决朝鲜战争的愿望，但是帝国主义者顽固地拒绝和平解决。我们现在仍旧希望朝鲜战争能够迅速获得和平解决。我们坚持一切外国军队必须迅速撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政必须由朝鲜人民自己解决。美国侵略军必须撤出台湾。中华人民共和国必须在联合国获得自己的合法地位。只有实现这些要求，才能和平解决亚洲问题。
    持久和平是全世界千百万人民的意志。这次由八十个国家的一千七百五十六位代表在华沙举行的世界和平大会最明显地表示了全世界人民的这种意志。这次世界和平大会所发表的告全世界人民的宣言和致联合国组织呼吁书，要求外国军队撤出朝鲜，和平结束朝鲜战争，并提出了争取世界和平的纲领，号召全世界人民一致努力，制止战争危机，要求召集苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国五大国的会议，讨论和平解决当前一切国际问题。大会的这些主张，都是中国人民所热烈拥护的。全国各民主党派、各人民团体应当动员全国人民，为实现华沙大会的决议而奋斗。
    华沙大会的胜利和朝鲜战场的胜利，同样是全世界人民反帝斗争高涨的标志，同样值得庆祝。由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若先生所率领的、包括各民主阶级、各民主党派、各民族和文化界、科学界、艺术界、宗教界的代表人物的、出席第二届世界和平大会的中国代表团，在这次大会上向全世界传达了中国人民坚决保卫世界和平的神圣意志。我们庆祝华沙大会的成功，并向代表团的各位代表表示我们的欢迎和感谢。
