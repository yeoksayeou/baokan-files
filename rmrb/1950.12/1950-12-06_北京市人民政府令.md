Beijing Urban Area (including the suburbs) Domestic Dog Registration and Management Measures

Article 1: All dogs kept by households in this city that are over two months old must be registered by the owner with the outdoor dog disposal center or registration office and obtain a dog tag in accordance with these measures.

Article 2: The dog registration applicant shall fill in the following items in accordance with the prescribed form (the registration form will be issued separately): (1) Name, age, place of origin, occupation, and address of the owner. (2) Breed, sex, color and characteristics, age, presence or absence of disease, ferocity or docility of the dog.

Article 3: After the dog is registered, each dog will receive one dog tag, which should be hung on its head. The validity period is one year. After the expiration date, a new application for renewal must be made. A fee may be charged for the aforementioned dog tag to cover the cost of production. The amount will be determined by the Municipal Sanitation and Engineering Bureau and reported to the Municipal People's Government for record.

Article 4: All registered dogs shall be simultaneously vaccinated against rabies. Thereafter, vaccinations shall be administered once or twice annually on schedule, and a vaccination certificate will be issued. The vaccination dates will be announced from time to time.

Article 5: If the dog tag is lost or damaged, the owner shall apply for cancellation and reissue a new tag, still paying the cost of production. If the owner's address changes or the dog undergoes any changes, the outdoor dog disposal center shall be notified for record.

Article 6: After the promulgation of these measures, all dogs scattered in the streets without registration tags or without owners leading them shall be regarded as outdoor dogs and shall be captured by the Municipal Outdoor Dog Disposal Center as soon as possible and sent to the center for disposal. However, registered dogs with tags, if the owner arbitrarily allows them to roam the streets, defecate at will, chase and bark, or bite pedestrians and obstruct traffic, shall also be captured.

Article 7: Any captured dog will be kept at the disposal center for three days. The owner may claim the dog within three days, but must humbly accept criticism and pay the daily feeding fee. If the dog has not been registered or vaccinated, the registration and vaccination procedures shall be completed in accordance with Articles 1 and 4, and then the dog shall be led away with a leash. Dogs not claimed within the time limit will be disposed of.

Article 8: Travelers carrying dogs staying in this city for more than one month shall complete registration, tag application, and vaccination procedures in accordance with these measures.

Article 9: When a dog dies, the owner shall immediately report it to the outdoor dog disposal center and surrender the original dog tag for cancellation.

Article 10: Dogs shall not be brought into public places (such as theaters and parks) or taken on public buses and streetcars.

Article 11: Dogs of a fierce nature that may harm people or livestock shall be strictly restrained by the owner or muzzled. If negligence results in injury to people or livestock, the owner shall bear medical expenses and other damages.

Article 12: If the owner discovers that their dog is sick, they should promptly seek treatment. In the event of rabies, the outdoor dog disposal center should be immediately notified to arrange for capture and killing, and the body should be cremated. If someone has been bitten by a rabid dog, the outdoor dog disposal center should be immediately notified, which will then inform the public health bureau to promptly dispatch personnel for vaccination and disinfection.

Article 13: Those who violate the provisions of these measures may be subject to appropriate penalties by the Municipal Sanitation and Engineering Bureau according to the severity of the circumstances.

Article 14: Matters not covered by these measures will be amended at any time.
