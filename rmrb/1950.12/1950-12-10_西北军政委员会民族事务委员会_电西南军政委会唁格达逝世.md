Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th. The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Northwest Military and Political Committee sent a telegram to the Southwest Military and Political Committee, mourning Geda, a member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, who was brutally poisoned to death by British imperialist special agents in Qamdo on August 22nd. The telegram stated: "We were shocked and grieved to learn that Living Buddha Geda was brutally poisoned to death by British imperialist special agents for his dedication to the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Living Buddha Geda's noble character of working tirelessly to protect the motherland and the happiness of the vast Tibetan compatriots, regardless of difficulties and dangers, is a model for the Tibetan and other ethnic groups. We, on behalf of the vast people of the nineteen ethnic groups in the Northwest, solemnly protest against this despicable and shameless act of the British imperialist special agents, and resolutely smash all the conspiracies and assassinations of British imperialism with practical actions to actively support the liberation of Tibet, defend the border of the motherland, and avenge Living Buddha Geda."
