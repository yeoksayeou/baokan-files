Xinhua News Agency, 1st—The Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council have jointly decided on the following measures for recruiting young students and workers to participate in various military cadre schools in order to accelerate our national defense construction:

    (1) The Air Force Schools, Navy Schools, and various specialized arms schools affiliated with the People's Revolutionary Military Commission will simultaneously conduct unified enrollment nationwide in the near future. Young students aged seventeen to twenty-five, with pure ideology, good health, and a cultural level of junior high school second grade or above, and young workers with a cultural level of higher elementary school are eligible to apply.

    (2) Local governments at the provincial, municipal (prefectural), and county levels should, based on the specific instructions from higher-level governments, absorb local educational administrative leading organs, New Democratic Youth League organizations, student federations, trade unions, and other relevant parties to immediately establish "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" to be responsible for carrying out local enrollment work.

    (3) Local "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" should be responsible for designating "Military Cadre School Student Recommendation Committees" in affiliated schools and factories. These "Recommendation Committees" should be jointly composed of schools, factories, New Democratic Youth League organizations, student unions, trade unions, and educational workers' unions. They will be responsible for handling the application procedures for their units and for initially reviewing the political and physical conditions of the applying students. The list of students from schools and factories applying to various military cadre schools should be submitted to the higher-level military cadre school enrollment committee after being filed with the school/factory administration.

    (4) The application period is from December 10th to January 10th, 1951. Other specific measures will be specifically stipulated by the local "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees."

    (5) All applying students must adhere to the principle of complete voluntarism. After application, all must be reviewed and approved by the "Recommendation Committees" of each school/factory and the local "Enrollment Committees" before being admitted.

    (6) This enrollment of young students and workers into various military cadre schools is of great significance for strengthening our national defense forces. It is hoped that all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic individuals from all walks of life nationwide will give their full assistance.
