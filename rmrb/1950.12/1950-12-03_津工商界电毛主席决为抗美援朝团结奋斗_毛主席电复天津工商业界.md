Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles, numbering over 42,000 people, held a demonstration parade on November 30th in support of resisting America and aiding Korea. They telegraphed Chairman Mao, reporting that all industrialists and merchants in Tianjin have united with people from all walks of life to jointly strive to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country. The original telegram is as follows:

Respectfully to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

We, all industrialists and merchants of Tianjin, in order to shatter the American imperialists' crazy and shameless aggression, have previously put forward four specific tasks as our guiding principles for action in resisting America and aiding Korea. We guarantee that we will resolutely and thoroughly implement them.

Today, we are holding a demonstration parade of over 40,000 people to tell the American imperialists that we have recognized their aggressive nature. All sectors of the country have united to jointly strive to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country to the end. We respectfully send this telegram. With the highest respect!

Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Country Demonstration Parade Committee, November 30th.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government today telegraphed in reply to Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice Chairmen Bi Mingqi and Zhu Jisheng, and the 42,000 patriotic compatriots of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles' Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Country Demonstration Parade Committee, welcoming their just demonstration parade held on November 30th, and expressing the hope that all patriotic industrialists and merchants in China, together with the masses of the people, will form a united front against imperialist aggression that is even more consolidated than in the past. Chairman Mao's reply telegram reads as follows:

Mr. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman, Mr. Zhu Jisheng, and the 42,989 patriotic compatriots of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles' Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Country Demonstration Parade Committee:

I have seen your telegram of November 30th. You have recognized the reactionary nature of the American imperialists' launching of aggression against China and Korea, you are not deceived by them, you are not afraid of their intimidation, you resolutely stand on the patriotic position of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country, and you held a just demonstration parade on November 30th. This is to be welcomed. The American imperialists have engaged in a great deal of deceptive propaganda against the Chinese people, and all patriots should not believe these deceptive statements. The American imperialists are invading Korea, invading China's Taiwan, bombing Northeast China, and using various hooligan methods to intimidate the Chinese people. All patriots should have the determination to resist American imperialist aggression and not be intimidated by them. The heroic actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country are to be praised. It is entirely correct that workers, peasants, intellectuals, and industrialists and merchants across the country, all patriots, unite to oppose American imperialist aggression. I hope that all patriotic industrialists and merchants in China, together with the masses of the people, will form a united front against imperialist aggression that is even more consolidated than in the past. This foreshadows that the Chinese people are bound to achieve final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression.

Mao Zedong, December 2, 1950.

    我们天津市全体工商业者，为了粉碎美帝疯狂无耻的侵略，前已提出了四项具体任务，作为我们抗美援朝的行动主范，我们保证，一定要坚决彻底地执行下去。

    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府毛泽东主席于今日电复天津市工商业联合会主任委员李烛尘、副主任委员毕鸣歧、朱继圣，及天津市工商业界抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会的四万二千多位爱国同胞，对他们在十一月三十日举行正义的示威游行表示欢迎，并希望全中国一切爱国的工商业家和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线。毛主席复电的电文如下：
    天津市工商业联合会主任委员李烛尘先生，副主任委员毕鸣歧先生，朱继圣先生，天津市工商业界抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会的四万二千九百八十九位爱国同胞们：
    你们在十一月三十日给我的电报看到了。你们认清了美帝国主义者发动侵略中国和朝鲜的反动性质，你们不受他们的欺骗，不怕他们的恐吓，坚决地站在抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国立场上，并在十一月三十日举行了正义的示威游行，这是值得欢迎的。美国帝国主义者对于中国人民做了很多的欺骗宣传，一切爱国者都不应相信这些欺骗言论。美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，侵略中国的台湾，轰炸中国的东北，并使用各种流氓手段恐吓中国人民，一切爱国者都应有决心反抗美帝国主义的侵略，并不受他们的恐吓。中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军的英勇行为，是值得赞扬的。全国工人、农民、知识分子及工商业家，凡属爱国者，一致团结起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略，是完全正确的。我希望全中国一切爱国的工商业家，和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，这就预示着中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。
            毛泽东    一九五○年十二月二日
