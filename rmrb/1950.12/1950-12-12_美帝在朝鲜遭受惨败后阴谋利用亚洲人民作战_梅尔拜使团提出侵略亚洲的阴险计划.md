    U.S. Imperialism Conspires to Use Asians to Fight Their Wars
    Melby Mission Proposes Sinister Plan to Invade Asia
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] After suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea, the American aggressors are plotting to use Asians to fight for America's expansionist policies. This sinister plan has been revealed in a highly confidential report to the U.S. National Security Council by the U.S. Melby and Erskine mission on "Organizing the Defense of Southeast Asia."
    According to the Bombay-based Blitz Weekly, the Melby-Erskine mission recommended in its report that steps be taken immediately to consolidate countries bordering China into a solid political and military alliance to serve as a bulwark for the U.S. in expanding its war of aggression in Asia. The report admits that the idea of concluding a Pacific Pact is not popular with the people of Asia. Therefore, the Melby-Erskine mission recommended that the United States and Britain should not directly conclude political and military alliances with Asian countries, but should use diplomatic tactics and economic resources to induce those countries bordering China to form a powerful alliance through bilateral agreements. The report insidiously suggests that the United States, Britain, and Australia only need to engage in behind-the-scenes manipulation. It would be a fatal mistake to attempt to bring all Southeast Asian countries together under the banner of a convention at this stage, regardless of the name of the convention. The report emphasized that achieving the same goal, with even better and faster results, can be done by having Asian countries conclude independent bilateral agreements with each other, linking these agreements into a common "anti-communist plan." The report also recommended that the United States should currently work to promote such bilateral agreements between Indonesia, the Philippines, Indochina, Malaya, Thailand, and Burma; and after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan should also be brought in. The report pointed out that the prerequisite for the implementation of this plan is to intensify the military suppression of the people's liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries, and to gradually absorb large quantities of strategic materials from these countries economically.
    The main principles embodied in this report have been accepted by the U.S. National Security Council and will become the guiding principles for U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia in the future.

    美帝在朝鲜遭受惨败后阴谋利用亚洲人民作战     
    梅尔拜使团提出侵略亚洲的阴险计划
    【新华社十一日讯】美国侵略者在朝鲜遭受惨败后，正图谋利用亚洲人民为美国的扩张政策作战。这一阴险计划已由美国梅尔拜和厄斯琴使团向美国国家安全委员会所提出的“组织东南亚防务”的极为机密的报告透露出来。
    据孟买出版的闪电周刊报道：梅尔拜、厄斯琴使团在报告中建议立即采取步骤巩固邻近中国的一些国家，使之成为一个坚固的政治和军事联盟，作为美国在亚洲扩大侵略战争的堡垒。该报告承认：缔结太平洋公约的主张并不受亚洲人民的欢迎。因此梅尔拜、厄斯琴使团建议：美国和英国不必直接与亚洲各国缔结政治和军事联盟，应该利用外交手腕和经济资源诱使那些与中国接壤的国家，通过双边协定结成一个强大的联盟。报告阴险地提出：美国、英国、澳大利亚只要实际上从事幕后操纵就够了。如果在现阶段就企图把所有东南亚国家结集在一个公约的旗帜下，不管这个公约的名称怎样，都将是一个致命的错误。报告强调称：使亚洲国家彼此之间订立独立的双边协定，把这些协定联成一个共同的“反共计划”，可以达到同样的目的，而且收效会更好更快些。该报告并建议美国目前应努力在印尼、菲律宾、印度支那、马来亚、泰国和缅甸之间促成这样的双边协定；在对日和约签订后，再把日本也拉进来。该报告指出实现这一计划的先决条件，是在军事上加紧镇压东南亚各国的人民解放运动，在经济上可逐渐吸取这些国家中大量的战略原料。
    这个报告中所体现的主要原则，已被美国国家安全委员会所接受，并将成为今后美国对东南亚政策的指导原则。
