Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: A map published in the September 11th issue of the American *Time* magazine once again proves that American imperialism attempts to use our Taiwan Province as a "key" to control the Pacific Ocean, and in the future world war that American imperialism is preparing to launch, it will use this to bomb China, the Soviet Union, and Indochina. The map draws an arc-shaped chain from Anadyr Bay near the Bering Strait in the north, through Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines, to the Caroline Islands, with our Taiwan Province as the "key" to this chain. The map straightforwardly points out: this chain is "America's strategic battle line." The map also uses Tokyo, Taiwan, and Guam as starting points, drawing three arc-shaped bombing circles towards China, the Soviet Union, and Indochina, and marking their bombing distances, indicating that from Tokyo it can bomb Northeast China and the Soviet Union; from Taiwan it can bomb South China and Indochina; and from Guam it can bomb New Guinea and Australia.

In the "War in Asia" column, the magazine more clearly exposed the crime of American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan Province when discussing the so-called "Pacific border issue." It said: "MacArthur, Radford (Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet), and other naval generals all believe that Taiwan must not fall into the hands of the enemy. ... If Taiwan is not occupied, the U.S. bases in Japan and the Philippines will be threatened from the side, and half of the Pacific will be lost as a result (Note: This statement is completely the sophistry of the invaders)."

The Shanghai *Liberation Daily* published the aforementioned map on the 3rd and pointed out: This is "American imperialism's confession of its crimes of aggression against Taiwan and Asia!"

    美国《时代》杂志地图供出罪证
    美帝攫我台湾图作侵略亚洲“锁钥”
    【本报讯】据新华社上海讯：美国《时代》杂志九月十一日出版的一期所刊登的一张地图，再一次证明美国帝国主义企图利用我国台湾省作为控制太平洋的“锁钥”，并在美帝国主义所准备发动的未来的世界大战中借此对我国、苏联及印度支那进行轰炸的阴谋。该图把北起白令海峡附近的阿那的尔海湾，南经日本、冲绳岛、台湾、菲律宾至加罗林群岛画成一弧形链条、其中以我国台湾省为这一链条的“锁钥”。该图并直率指出：这一锁链为“美国战略上的战线。”该图又以东京、台湾、关岛为出发点，向我国、苏联和印度支那方向画成三个弧形轰炸圈，并标明其轰炸距离，指明自东京出发可以轰炸我国东北和苏联；自台湾出发可以轰炸华南及印度支那；自关岛出发可以轰炸新几内亚及澳洲。
    该杂志在“亚洲的战争”一栏中谈到所谓“太平洋境界问题”时，更明显地暴露了美国帝国主义侵略我国台湾省的罪行。其中说：“麦克阿瑟、雷德福（美国太平洋舰队司令）及其他海军将领均认为台湾决不能落于敌人手中。………如果不占领台湾、则美国在日本和菲律宾的基地将侧面受到威胁，半边太平洋也将因此失去（按：这种说法完全是侵略者的诡辩）。”
    上海解放日报于三日将上述地图刊出，并指出：这是“美帝国主义侵略台湾及亚洲的自供罪证！”
