    Hold Good District and Township People's Representative Meetings

    At present, the main task of constructing district and township people's power is to establish and hold good district and township people's representative meetings, and further implement Chairman Mao's instruction that "it is necessary to conscientiously hold good people's representative meetings of all circles, sufficient to unite people of all circles to jointly carry out work" into the grassroots regime. The "Organizational Regulations for District People's Representative Conferences of All Circles," "Organizational Regulations for District People's Government and District Offices," "Organizational Regulations for Township (Administrative Village) People's Representative Conferences," and "Organizational Regulations for Township (Administrative Village) People's Government" promulgated by the Government Administration Council are the basis for local construction of district and township people's power.

    Whether or not a district should become a level of political power to convene people's representative meetings of all circles should be determined by the specific circumstances of each locality, and it is not appropriate to make rigid regulations for a long period of time or for the entire region. In the new districts, the role of the District People's Representative Conference of All Circles is greater during the land reform period or the initial stage of land reform, and it should generally be held; in the old districts, counties with too many townships or administrative villages can hold people's representative meetings of all circles with the district as a level of political power, in order to spread government policies, express people's opinions, and strengthen rural construction; in counties with not many townships or administrative villages, the general townships can have representatives to participate in the county people's representative meeting, and the direct contact between the county and the township is not very difficult, then there is no need to hold people's representative meetings of all circles with the district as a level of political power, so as to avoid too many meetings and affect mass production.

    The township (administrative village – hereinafter the same) is the grassroots organization of the people's power. If the construction of this level of political power is good, our various tasks in the rural areas will be promoted more effectively and truly implemented among the broad masses of peasants. The construction of township people's power did not start today. The democratic essence and democratic system have long existed in the villages of the old liberated areas. In the past year, with the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Provincial, Municipal, and County People's Representative Conferences of All Circles, the people's democratic system has become more popular in the rural areas of the country; whether in the new or old areas, township peasant representative meetings, township people's representative meetings, or people's congresses have generally been convened. Many regions can grasp the principle of proceeding from reality, and when carrying out production and construction or other work, representatives are elected by the residential areas, everyone discusses, decides on methods, and starts working together; the meeting is very simple, and each time only one or two main issues are discussed. After several such meetings, cadres and the masses experienced the benefits, and a system was naturally formed. Whenever the higher authorities handed down major tasks or the people demanded to solve certain major problems, such meetings were convened. Wherever this was done, the masses were happy and the cadres were also happy; the masses felt that they had a place to speak, their words mattered, and their actions were effective; the cadres also felt that there were more people, more wisdom, and greater strength; the work style of monopolizing and commanding was corrected, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was further strengthened. Wherever this was not done, but only pursued formality, adopting a set of cumbersome and complicated methods such as registering citizens, examining citizens' qualifications, mechanically dividing electoral districts, nominating candidates, voting or bean-casting elections, and the meeting did not solve the current urgent problems of the masses, the result was that it only delayed the production of the masses, could not give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, and therefore could not truly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    At present, in various parts of the country, not many district people's representative meetings have been held, and township people's representative meetings have been held more universally, and holding good township people's representative meetings is also a universal requirement. How can we hold good meetings?

    First of all, the leading organs at all levels should understand that the establishment of the people's democratic system should proceed from the actual situation and the actual needs of the people, especially at the lower levels, in order to give full play to the democratic strength of the broad rural people. In areas where land reform has been completed, the township people's representative meeting is a very good democratic system; in areas where land reform has not been completed, the township peasant representative meeting exercising the functions and powers of the township people's representative meeting is also very timely. Whether it is a township people's representative meeting or a township peasant representative meeting, it must become an organ of power for the people to exercise political power; it has the right to discuss and decide on all major events in the villages, and has the right to criticize and check the work of the township people's government and the work style of township cadres. Where conditions permit to elect the township people's government, the election should be implemented as soon as possible with the approval of the county people's government. The township people's government should be responsible to the township people's representative meeting and report its work, and the representatives should be responsible to the residents they represent and report their work.

    Secondly, the establishment and convening of township people's representative meetings is aimed at conveying government orders, promoting work, and solving practical problems in the lives of the local people. In the newly liberated areas, at present, the most prominent and most basic demands of the masses are anti-hegemony, rent reduction, and land reform; in the old liberated areas, generally speaking, production and construction are the most prominent and most basic demands of the masses, and the township people's representative meeting should take this as the regular central content. All issues related to this should be brought to the meeting for discussion and resolution. Other issues such as public grain, taxation, education, health, and financial revenue and expenditure that are related to the interests of the people of the whole township should also be discussed and resolved through representative meetings. However, cadres and the masses should be made to realize that the representative meeting is an organ for discussing and resolving major issues in the whole township, not an organ for handling daily trivial matters. In some places, problems such as disputes between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are also brought to the meeting for discussion and resolution, and meetings are held more than a dozen times a month, which affects production and makes the masses feel overwhelmed, which is inappropriate. As long as the resolutions of the township people's representative meeting do not conflict with the laws and regulations of the higher-level people's government, the township people's government should obtain the assistance of all representatives to jointly mobilize the broad masses of people to implement them together. Each representative should lead and contact several households, convene residents' meetings to discuss and check work. The township people's government should organize various regular or temporary committees in order to absorb non-representative activists to participate in the work.

    Again, overcoming the commanding style of some township cadres and fully promoting democracy is the key to holding good township people's representative meetings. The quality of most township cadres is good, resolute and brave, active and responsible, but due to the influence of the old society, they generally lack democratic habits, and some cadres have also been infected with some bad work styles such as monopolizing, beating, and detaining people from the feudal ruling class. The existence of these work styles seriously hinders the development of people's democracy. In addition to explaining the principles to them, the higher-level leading organs must also stipulate systems to ensure that they earnestly and conscientiously convene representative meetings, and humbly and sincerely accept the opinions and criticisms of the people. According to the regulations stipulated in the regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council, in the future, all issues that should be discussed and resolved at the representative meeting must be discussed and resolved at the representative meeting, and cannot be decided by a few cadres on their own. When holding meetings, we should think of more ways, offer more ideas, and persuade more. We must obey the opinions of the majority and cannot do whatever a few cadres want. If the work is done wrong, we must accept criticism. No matter whether the criticism is right or wrong, we must not get angry, let alone retaliate; accept the right and explain the wrong. We must learn to turn the tasks assigned by the higher authorities into the strength of the masses through meetings and representatives. Therefore, we must consult with the representatives before and during the meeting, listen to their opinions, and carefully consider them, and we must not adopt the blunt style of "I pass, you pass." The resolutions of the representative meeting must be resolutely implemented. In this way, we will realize the greatness of the people's wisdom and strength from the actual education of people's democracy; bad work styles will naturally be corrected.

    The township people's representative meeting and the township peasant representative meeting in the new districts are a very good way to mobilize the masses, educate the masses, and improve the consciousness of the masses; at the same time, only on the basis of mass mobilization and gradual improvement of mass consciousness can the people's representative meeting be gradually built and developed. Without mass mobilization and improvement of consciousness, it is impossible to complete the construction of the rural people's political power.

    The above-mentioned experience in holding good township people's representative meetings is also generally applicable to district people's representative meetings.

    Finally, it must be recognized that the people's democratic dictatorship includes two aspects: democracy for the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries. While fully promoting democracy, we must strengthen the dictatorship over the enemy. The two are indispensable. In rural areas, we should especially emphasize the dictatorship over the feudal landlord class, which is the social foundation on which all counter-revolutionaries depend. It is also an important link in consolidating the rear area and resisting imperialist aggression. In areas where land reform has not been completed, the material foundation of feudal autocracy has not been destroyed, and they will conspire to sabotage land reform and other social reforms. These situations should arouse our serious vigilance and attention. The composition of district and township people's representative meetings should pay attention to the universality of representatives on the one hand. Only by doing a good job in the rural united front work can we realize a strong dictatorship over the enemy. On the other hand, we must pay attention to the seriousness of the representatives. The remaining forces of the feudal landlord class and their agents, as well as all reactionary elements, should be completely removed from the district and township people's political power. The district and township people's representative meetings in the new districts should emphasize establishing the superiority of the basic masses, uniting all anti-feudal forces to fight against the feudal landlord class.

    Establishing and holding good district and township people's representative meetings and making them a regular system is a long-term and arduous political task. The party and government leading organs of the province and prefecture should pay attention to supervision and inspection. If they find that a district or township has not held a meeting for a long time, they should be criticized; at the same time, the party and government leading organs of the county should guide and help to do a good job in several typical districts and townships, so that cadres and the masses have specific examples to learn from, and improve their understanding and promote experience from practice.

### 开好区、乡人民代表会议

    开好区、乡人民代表会议
    目前区、乡人民政权建设的主要课题，就是建立和开好区、乡人民代表会议，将毛主席“必须认真开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各界人民代表会议”的指示，进一步贯彻到基层政权中去。政务院颁布的区各界人民代表会议组织通则、区人民政府及区公所组织通则、乡（行政村）人民代表会议组织通则和乡（行政村）人民政府组织通则，是各地建设区、乡人民政权的依据。
    区应否成为一级政权召开各界人民代表会议，各地应分别具体情况而定，不宜作长时期的或整个区域的硬性规定。新区在土地改革期间或土地改革完成初期，区各界人民代表会议作用较大，一般应该开；老区乡或行政村单位过多的县，为了传播政府政策，表达人民意见并加强农村建设事业起见，可将区作为一级政权召开各界人民代表会议；乡或行政村不多的县，一般的乡均能有代表参加县人民代表会议，县与乡直接联系已不很困难，则无须将区作为一级政权召开各界人民代表会议，以免会议太多，影响群众生产。
    乡（行政村——下同）是人民政权的基层组织，这一级政权建设好，我们在农村中的各种工作将更有力地推进，并真正贯彻到广大农民群众中去。乡人民政权建设工作不是从今天才开始，民主实质和民主制度，在老解放区的乡村中早就有的。过去一年中随着人民政协和省、市、县各界人民代表会议的召开，人民民主制度更普及于全国的乡村；无论新、老地区，一般都召开了乡农民代表会、乡人民代表会议或人民代表大会。不少地区能掌握从实际出发的方针，在进行生产建设或其他工作时，就由居民区推举代表，大家商量，议定办法，一齐动手去做；会开得很简单，每次只讨论一两个主要问题。这样开上几次，干部和群众体验到好处，很自然地形成一种制度，每逢上级交下重大任务或人民要求解决某种重大问题的时候，就召开这种会议。凡是这样作了的，群众愉快，干部也愉快；群众感到有了说话的地方，说话顶事，办事生效；干部也感到人多智广力量大；包办代替、强迫命令的作风得到了纠正，干群关系进一步密切起来。凡不是这样作的，而只是追求形式，采用登记公民、审查公民资格、机械划分选区、提候选人、投票或投豆选举等一套烦琐复杂的方式，会议又不解决群众当前的迫切问题，结果，徒然耽误了群众的生产，不可能发挥群众的积极性，因而也就不可能真正改进干部与群众的关系。
    目前全国各地，区人民代表会议开得不多，乡人民代表会议开的较普遍，而开好乡人民代表会议也是普遍的要求。怎样才能开好呢？
    首先，各级领导机关应当了解：人民民主制度的建立，愈到下层，愈应从当地实际情况和人民的实际需要出发，以发挥广大农村人民的民主力量。在土地改革已完成的地区，乡人民代表会议是很好的民主制度；在土地改革未完成的地区，乡农民代表会执行乡人民代表会议职权，也是很合时宜的。无论乡人民代表会议或乡农民代表会，均必须成为人民行使政权的权力机关；有权讨论和决定乡村中一切大事，有权批评检查乡人民政府的工作和乡干部的作风。凡有条件选举乡人民政府的，即应经县人民政府批准尽早实行选举。乡人民政府应对乡人民代表会议负责并报告工作，代表应对其所代表的居民负责并报告工作。
    其次，乡人民代表会议的建立和召开，目的在于传达政令推动工作和解决当地人民生活中的实际问题。在新解放区，目前反霸、减租和土地改革是群众最突出的最基本的要求；在老解放区，一般说来，生产建设是群众最突出、最基本的要求，乡人民代表会议应以此为经常的中心内容。举凡与此有关的问题，均应提到会议上讨论解决。其他如公粮、税收、教育、卫生、财政收支等有关全乡人民利益的问题，都应经过代表会议讨论解决。但应使干部和群众认识到代表会议是讨论解决全乡重大问题的，而不是办理日常琐碎事务的机关，有些地方把公婆和儿媳打架一类问题，也拿到会上讨论解决，一月开十几次会议，影响生产，使群众不胜其烦，这是不适当的。乡人民代表会议的决议，只要与上级人民政府法令不相抵触，乡人民政府就应取得各代表的协助一道动员广大人民合力执行。每个代表分别领导联系几户居民，召开居民会议讨论与检查工作。乡人民政府应组织各种经常的或临时的委员会，以便吸收非代表的积极分子参加工作。
    再次，克服某些乡干部强迫命令作风，充分发扬民主，是开好乡人民代表会议的关键。大多数乡干部的品质是好的，坚决勇敢，积极负责，但由于旧社会的影响，一般地还缺乏民主习惯，有一部分干部并从封建统治阶级那里染上了一些包办代替、打人扣人等恶劣作风，这些作风的存在，就严重地妨碍着人民民主的发扬。上级领导机关除应向他们讲清道理而外，还须规定制度，使其必须认真切实地召开代表会议，并虚心诚恳地接受人民的意见和批评。按照政务院所颁通则规定，今后凡应该在代表会上讨论解决的问题，必须在代表会上讨论解决，不能由少数干部自作主张。开会时要多想办法，多出主意，多加说服，要服从多数人的意见，不能少数干部想怎样就怎样。工作作错了要接受批评，不管批评的对与不对，不要发脾气，更不应报复；对的接受，不对的解释。要学会把上级交付的任务，通过会议和代表成为群众的力量，因此要在会前会时和代表协商，倾听意见，酝酿成熟，而不能生硬采取“我通你过”的作风。代表会的决议，要坚决执行。这样，我们从人民民主的实际教育中将认识到人民智慧与力量的伟大；不良的作风自然得到改正。
    乡人民代表会议和新区的乡农代会是发动群众、教育群众、提高群众觉悟的一种很好的方式；同时，也只有在群众发动与群众觉悟逐步提高的基础之上，人民代表会也才能逐步建设和发展，没有群众的发动与觉悟之提高，要完成乡村人民政权建设是不可能的。
    上述开好乡人民代表会议的经验，一般也适用于区的人民代表会议。
    最后，还须认清，人民民主专政包括对人民的民主和对反动派的专政两个方面，在充分发扬民主的同时，必须加强对敌人的专政，二者是不可偏废的。在农村中应特别强调对封建地主阶级的专政，它是一切反革命所依存的社会基础。也是巩固后方反抗帝国主义侵略重要环节之一。在尚未完成土地改革的地区，封建专制主义的物质基础尚未摧垮，他们更将阴谋破坏土改，破坏其他的社会改革。这些情况应引起我们严重的警惕与注意。区、乡人民代表会议的组成，一方面应注意代表的广泛性，只有作好农村统一战线工作，才能实现对敌人强有力的专政。另方面必须注意代表的严肃性，封建地主阶级的残余势力和其代理人以及一切反动分子，应从区、乡人民政权中彻底清除出去。新区的区乡人民代表会议，更应强调树立基本群众的优势，团结一切反封建势力向封建地主阶级进行斗争。
    建立和开好区乡人民代表会议并使之成为经常制度，是一个长期而繁重的政治任务。省和专区的党、政领导机关应注意督促检查，发现那个区乡长期不开会议的，应予以指责；同时县的党政领导机关应指导帮助做好几个典型区、乡，使干部和群众有学习的具体榜样，并从实践中提高认识和推广经验。
