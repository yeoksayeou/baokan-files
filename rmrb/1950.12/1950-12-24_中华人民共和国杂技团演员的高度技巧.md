    The High Skills of the Actors of the People's Republic of China Acrobatic Troupe
    Nikolay Barkinovich, Principal of the Soviet National Circus School
    The performances of the actors of the People's Republic of China Acrobatic Troupe have attracted the widest attention from all walks of life in Moscow, and have also aroused great interest among Soviet circus workers.
    Regarding the working style of the Chinese acrobatic troupe's actors, I would like to express some of my thoughts. One of the most valuable qualities of the Chinese acrobatic troupe is its brilliantly demonstrated popular and national characteristics. Troupe leader Ding Li deserves great credit in this regard. He has been able to preserve the truly national Chinese style in the oldest and most beloved popular circus art, and has enabled the acrobatic troupe to avoid the decadent and degenerate influences of capitalist, especially American, circuses.
    The combination of joy and sophistication in performance style with purity, nobility, and naturalness in art – these characteristics are very close to our Soviet circus performers.
    Among the many wonderful programs presented by our Chinese actor friends in Moscow, I would like to first point out one of the best. This is Ge Shuwang's powerful performance. His technique has reached the highest form of perfection in balancing and manipulating heavy jars. He can throw these jars high into the air and then catch them lightly, while these jars can safely land on his head, forehead, and nose.
    Jin Yeqin also performed outstanding skills. This artist performed various endless tricks on a bicycle. At the same time, none of the tricks he performed were repeated. Only the most outstanding technicians can achieve this result. Several of Jin Yeqin's performances are truly record-breaking. For example, he can lightly carry two female companions on the bicycle. This excellent actor performs very easily, as if the difficult programs he performs are without any difficulty for him.
    I also like the "Spinning Top" program. This is performed by young actors Wang Kuiying and Wang Shuying. It is very interesting that in the performance, the actors use various household utensils to perform, such as earthenware pots and glass pots. It must be pointed out that in many other programs of the Chinese actors, they often use the daily necessities around people, and show complete proficiency in playing with these utensils.
    The Chinese apparatus gymnastics performance by actors Cao Pengfei and Cao Guifu is also worthy of praise. You might imagine that this program originated from national sports, but judging from the program and movements and the difficulty of the performance, it is much higher than sports achievements. The technical elements unique to circus art are added to it. The result is an excellent national sports program.
    In several programs, the humorous Guan Yuhe participated very well. His general humor is organically integrated into the programs he performs; his rich talent for expression, improvisation, and flexibility have won the audience's applause. Guan Yuhe is already sixty-one years old. This is simply unbelievable, especially when you see the "Chinese Struggle" program, where this short old artist lifts four stone weights and his four companions at the end of the program!
    Having worked in the circus for twenty years, and now engaged in training new circus performers at the National Circus School, I would like to offer some friendly advice to the talented and highly skilled young Chinese acrobats.
    In the magic programs, it is best to see elements of political satire. This can give the program a certain tension and increase their appeal to the audience. This satirical element can be added to Guan Yuhe's performance, because he has a light general humor, great illusion, and excellent expressive talent.
    There is one more point that I think is also worth considering for the Chinese acrobatic troupe: that is to create some grand farces based on the history of the Chinese people's liberation struggle against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the American and British imperialists. If all the possibilities in acrobatic art are utilized in the play, then it will become a kind of farce that is truly loved by the people. Such drama will promote the development of new Chinese art in many ways.
    Finally, I would like to point out that the Chinese acrobatic troupe's visit to our Moscow and the warm welcome they received from the Muscovites is a testament to the consolidated friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. I hope that the young Chinese acrobats will gain creative achievements and joy in serving their people. (Translated by Jun Qiang)

    中华人民共和国杂技团演员的高度技巧
    苏联国立马戏学校校长  尼古拉·巴尔基诺维奇
    中华人民共和国杂技团演员们的表演，吸引了莫斯科各界居民最广泛的注意，还使苏联马戏工作者感到非常的兴趣。
    关于中国杂技团演员工作的风格，我愿意表示我的一点感想。中国杂技团最宝贵的品质之一，就是它那光辉地表现出来的人民的和民族的特性。杂技团团长丁里在这方面是有很大功绩的，他能在最古老最可爱的人民马戏艺术中，保存真正民族的中国风格，并使杂技团避免了资本主义的，尤其是美国马戏的颓废堕落的影响。
    表演风格上的快乐、高妙与艺术上的纯洁、高尚、自然相结合——这些特点是与我们苏联马戏演员非常接近的。
    我们的中国演员朋友们在莫斯科所演出的许多精彩节目中间，我愿首先指出最好的一个。这是佫树旺的有力的表演。他的技术在平衡和运用沉重的坛子方面，达到了最高的完美形式。他可以把这些坛子高高地投向空中，然后轻妙地接住，同时这些坛子可以安然地落到他的头上，额上和鼻子上。
    金业勤也表演了出色的技术。这个艺人在一辆自行车上表演出了各式各样无尽的花样。同时他所表演的把戏没有一个是重复的。只有最出色的技人才能达到这种成果。金业勤的几个表演是真正打破纪录的。例如，他能把两个女同伴轻巧地带到自行车上。这个卓越的演员非常轻松地表演着，好像他所表演的这些繁难的节目在他没有任何困难似的。
    我也喜欢“陀螺”的节目。这是年青的演员王葵英和王淑英表演的。非常有趣的是在表演中，演员们使用各种家常用具来表演，如瓦罐、玻璃壶等。必需指出：在中国演员的许多其他项目中，也时常利用人们周围的日常生活用品，并表示出玩耍这些器皿的完全熟练。
    曹鹏飞和曹贵富两演员的中国器械操表演，也是值得赞美的。你会想像到这个节目是从国民体育中产生的，但是从表演的节目和动作姿式以及表演的困难来看，比体育成就高得多多了。这其中加入了马戏艺术特有的技巧成分。结果成为优越的民族体育节目。
    有几个节目中，诙谐的关玉和很好地参加了。他的一般的幽默有机地渗透在他所表演的项目之中；丰富的表情天才，随机应变和灵活博得了观众的掌声。关玉和已经六十一岁了。这简直使人不能相信，尤其是当你看到“中国的斗争”的节目的时候，这个身材不高的老艺人在这个节目的末尾，举起了四根石担子和自己的四个同伴！
    我在马戏场中工作了二十年，现在又在国立马戏学校从事培养新马戏演员的工作，我愿对有才能的和高度技术素养的年青的中国杂技演员们供献一点友谊的意见。
    在戏法的节目中，最好能看到政治讽刺的成分。这可以赋与这节目一定的紧张性，提高它们给观众的感受性。这种讽刺成分，可以增加到关玉和的表演中，因为他具有轻巧的一般的诙谐，大的幻惑力和优美的表情才能。
    还有一点，我觉得也值得中国杂技团来考虑一下：就是创作一些雄壮的闹剧，取材于中国人民反对卖国贼蒋介石及美英帝国主义者的解放斗争的历史。如果把杂技艺术中的一切可能性利用到剧中去，那就会成为真正人民所心爱的一种闹剧。这样的剧艺会在多方面促进新中国艺术的发展。
    最后，我愿指出：中国杂技团演员到我们的莫斯科来，莫斯科人热烈欢迎他们，这就证明着中苏两大民族的巩固友谊。我希望年青的中国杂技团演员们，在为自己人民服务中获得创造性的成就与快乐。（君强译）
