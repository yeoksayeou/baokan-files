    Responding to the Call of the World Peace Congress!
    The Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression
    The Second World Peace Congress victoriously concluded in Warsaw on November 22nd. Over 1,700 delegates from eighty countries worldwide extensively exchanged opinions on defending world peace at the congress. The congress passed the "Declaration to the People of the World," the "Letter to the United Nations Organization," and a resolution supporting persecuted peace fighters. These are all great documents in human history. This congress was a meeting of great significance in human history.
    The 475 million people of China resolutely support the declaration, appeal, and resolutions passed by the World Peace Congress. We unconditionally endorse the spirit and letter of these great documents.
    "Peace must not be waited for, it must be won," is a solemn call in the declaration of the World Peace Congress. The Chinese people believe this is an irrefutable truth. The Chinese people have decided to respond to this call with concrete and active actions.
    The war of aggression waged by American imperialists and their accomplices in Korea today is a serious threat to world peace and security. As the "Declaration to the People of the World" states, this war "ravages Korea today and threatens to plunge the whole world into flames tomorrow." The Chinese people are today helping the Korean people jointly extinguish the flames of imperialist aggression through volunteer actions. This action of the Chinese people is entirely consistent with the spirit of this World Peace Congress. The declaration of the Second World Peace Congress has given the Chinese people even stronger confidence in the final victory of the struggle against American aggression.
    The Chinese people believe that the ten suggestions in the appeal to the United Nations by this World Peace Congress are the most appropriate solution to salvaging the current international crisis. It fully represents the will of the entire Chinese people. We, the Chinese people, firmly advocate that American imperialists and their accomplices withdraw their invading troops and stop the war of aggression in order to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. We firmly advocate investigating and determining MacArthur's responsibility for undermining peace in the Far East. We firmly advocate prohibiting imperialists from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, punishing instigators of new wars, and eliminating all racial discrimination and oppression. We firmly oppose the arming of Japan and West Germany by imperialists to undermine world peace. We firmly support the prohibition of atomic weapons and universal disarmament. We firmly believe that convening a conference of the five major powers—the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—is the most appropriate and effective way to jointly resolve the many international differences that exist today. These suggestions in the appeal are precisely the goals for which the Chinese people are striving today.
    Two hundred and twenty-three million Chinese people have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. This proves the Chinese people's boundless trust in the World Peace Congress. The Chinese people absolutely respect the leadership and instructions of the World Peace Congress.
    The Chinese people will always remember: the struggle for peace is our own responsibility.
    The Chinese people will always remember: "Peace must not be waited for, it must be won!"
    The Chinese people will surely unite closely with all peace-loving people around the world and strive together to realize the concrete resolutions and suggestions of the Second World Peace Congress!

    响应世界保卫和平大会的号召！
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    第二届世界保卫和平大会已于十一月二十二日在华沙胜利闭幕了。全世界八十个国家的一千七百多个代表在大会中广泛地交换了关于保卫世界和平的意见。大会通过了《告全世界人民的宣言》，《致联合国组织书》和声援受迫害的和平战士的决议。这些都是人类历史上伟大的文件。这次大会是人类历史上具有重大意义的会议。
    中国四万七千五百万人民坚决拥护世界保卫和平大会所通过的宣言、呼吁书和决议。我们无条件地拥护这些伟大文件的精神和文字。
    “绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”，这是世界保卫和平大会宣言上一个庄严的号召。中国人民认为这是一个颠扑不破的真理。中国人民决定用具体和积极的行动来响应这个号召。
    美帝国主义者及其帮凶今天在朝鲜进行的侵略战争是全世界人类和平与安全的严重威胁。诚如《告全世界人民的宣言》所说，这个战争“今天蹂躏着朝鲜，明天势将把全世界投入火焰”。中国人民今天正在用志愿的行动帮助朝鲜人民共同扑灭帝国主义侵略的战火。中国人民的这个行动与这次世界保卫和平大会的精神是完全一致的。第二届世界保卫和平大会的宣言使中国人民对于反对美国侵略的斗争的最后胜利得到了更坚强的信心。
    中国人民认定这次世界保卫和平大会致联合国呼吁书中的十项建议是挽救当前国际危机最妥善的方案。它完全代表了中国全体人民的意志。我们中国人民坚决主张美帝国主义者及其帮凶撤退侵略军队，停止侵略战争，以便用和平方式解决朝鲜问题。我们坚决主张调查并确定麦克阿瑟破坏远东和平的责任。我们坚决主张禁止帝国主义者干涉他国的内政，惩治新战争宣传者，扫除一切对种族的歧视与压迫。我们坚决反对帝国主义者们武装日本和西德以破坏世界和平。我们坚决支持禁用原子武器和普遍裁减军备。我们坚决相信，召开中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国、法国的五大国会议是共同解决当前国际间许多意见分歧的最适当有效的办法。呼吁书中的这些建议正是今天中国人民奋斗的目标。
    中国人民有了二亿二千三百万人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名。这证明中国人民对世界保卫和平大会的无限信任。中国人民绝对尊重世界保卫和平大会的领导和指示。
    中国人民会永远记住：争取和平的斗争是我们自己的责任。
    中国人民会永远记住：“绝对不能等待和平，必须去争取和平！”
    中国人民必定与全世界爱好和平的人民，紧密地团结起来，共同为实现第二届世界保卫和平大会的具体决议与建议而奋斗！
