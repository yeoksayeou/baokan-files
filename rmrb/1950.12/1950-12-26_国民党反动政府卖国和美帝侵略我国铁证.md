Editor's Note: The two images below are ironclad proof that the Kuomintang reactionary government allowed the U.S. Department of the Army to conduct aerial photography in China in 1946. Image (1) is the instruction from the Liaoning Provincial Government of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique to the Anshan Municipal Government in February 1946, issued after the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang reactionary government approved the U.S. Department of the Army conducting aerial photography in various parts of China. Image (2) is the instruction from the Anshan Municipal Government to the puppet police bureau and puppet police brigade. These two images further prove the American imperialists' conspiracy to invade our country and allow us to more clearly recognize the Kuomintang reactionary government's traitorous crimes.

The original text of instruction (1) is:

"Ordered by the Executive Yuan to inform about the U.S. Department of the Army conducting aerial photography in China.

Ordered by the Executive Yuan, Jie Lu Zi No. 02261, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the U.S. Embassy's note requesting our government's approval for the U.S. military to conduct aerial photography in various provinces and Taiwan had been previously reported and filed. Now, a reply from the General Headquarters states that the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Military Headquarters in Shanghai, Major General Ma Daoer, requested in Memorandum No. 831-B on November 21, 1945, that our country approve the use of American aircraft based in Okinawa to conduct aerial photography flights in China, Mongolia, and the Northeast, and that the results of these flights be transferred to our side in accordance with the agreement being discussed in Washington. It was signed and approved by Chairman, who sent a telegram instructing that it be handled accordingly. Before the details of the negotiations in Washington are known, the previous cooperative aerial survey and mutual benefit method of the 14th Air Force will be temporarily followed, and the U.S. side has been informed. It is now known that the U.S. aircraft are K5323 Liberator type, etc. In addition to notifying the U.S. Embassy and sending separate letters to the Ministry of Military Administration and the Ministry of Military Orders, it is also reported for your review. It has already been instructed by the Chairman that, except for Xinjiang, which should be postponed, the rest should be handled as proposed. Now, based on the aforementioned situation, in addition to instructing and distributing to various provincial and municipal governments, you are hereby ordered to inform." (Attached image)

    国民党反动政府卖国和美帝侵略我国铁证
    编者按：下面两图是国民党反动政府在一九四六年允许美帝陆军部在中国进行空中摄影的铁证。图（一）是蒋匪辽宁省政府奉国民党反动政府行政院准许美帝陆军部在中国各地进行空中摄影的训令后，于一九四六年二月对鞍山市政府的训令；图（二）是鞍山市政府向伪警察局和伪警察大队的训令。从这两个图上，进一步证明了美帝侵略我国的阴谋，并使我们更清楚地认识了国民党反动政府卖国的罪行。
     图（一）训令的原文是：
    “奉行政院令知美陆军部在中国从事空中摄影案转行知照由
    奉行政院节陆字第零二二六一号训令内开外交部呈称关于美国大使馆照会请求我政府核准美军在我内地各省及台湾等地从事空中摄影事前经呈报在卷兹复准军令部函略以该案经驻沪美军总部参谋长马道儿中将于一九四五年十一月二十一日以８３１—Ｂ号备忘录请求我国准于使用以冲绳岛为基地之美国飞机在中国蒙古东北各地作空中照相飞行并将各项飞行结果依照正在华府商议之协定转告我方经签奉委座电派照办在华府协商内容未获悉前暂照上次十四航空队合作航测互惠办法办理并经转告美方兹悉美方航机系Ｋ５３２３号解放式等由除已照会美大使馆并分函军政军令两部外理合呈请鉴察等情查此案已另奉主席电示除新疆仍应缓议外余准如拟办理兹据前情除指令并分行各省市政府外仰合行令知照”（附图片）
