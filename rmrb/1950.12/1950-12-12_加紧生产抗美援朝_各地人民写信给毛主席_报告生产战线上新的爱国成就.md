    Intensify Production to Resist America and Aid Korea
    People from Various Places Write Letters to Chairman Mao
    Reporting New Patriotic Achievements on the Production Front
    Letter from All Representatives of the Changchun People's Representative Conference
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the representatives of the Third People's Representative Conference of Changchun County, first thank you and the Communist Party for your wise leadership. This year, the county has had a bumper harvest, yielding five to six *shi* per *héctare*. We live in warm houses. Men, women, old, and young are all dressed in cotton-padded clothes. We remember the well-digger when we drink the water; we will never forget the kindness of you and the Communist Party. Recently, we heard about the inhuman atrocities of the American imperialists who are slaughtering the Korean people. Our hearts ache, and we are filled with anger. We are reminded of the various sufferings that the Japanese imperialists brought us in the past fourteen years. We all vow to you: We guarantee to do the following: First, conduct current affairs propaganda and thoroughly expose the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. Second, prepare horses, carts, and people, and be ready to go to Korea at any time to fight alongside the Korean people. Third, select good grain and deliver the patriotic grain. Fourth, mobilize the masses of the county to prepare for production in 1951, and increase production by another 500 *jin* per *héctare* on the basis of 2,500 *jin* this year.
                            The Third People's Representative Conference of Changchun County
                                              November 28th
    Letter from All Heroes and Models of Ji'yuan County
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Since you issued the call for increased production last year, the people of Ji'yuan have become more prosperous. Please take a look at the gifts of a year's production: Last year, there were 70,000 *mu* of irrigated land, which has increased to 100,000 *mu* this year. Last year, there were 37,000 head of livestock, which has increased to 52,000 head this year. Last year, 49,000 *mu* of cotton were planted, producing approximately 490,000 *jin* of cotton. This year, 53,000 *mu* of cotton were planted, producing 954,000 *jin* of cotton. Last year, wheat production was 170,000 *shi* (due to famine); this year it has increased to 260,000 *shi*. Last year, autumn grain production was 220,000 *shi*; this year it has increased to 330,000 *shi*. Last year, there were 119,500 large farm tools; this year there are more than 200,000. These achievements are due to your wise leadership and correct policies.
    At this conference, we studied current affairs and recognized that China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth, and the criminal behavior of American imperialism. We unanimously expressed: "What the front needs, we will provide! We will provide people if they are needed; we will provide grain if it is needed; we will provide money if it is needed, even if we eat chaff and vegetables in the rear, we will supply the front lines to defeat American imperialism." Old Lady Li is 66 years old, and she said, "I must write a letter to Chairman Mao. I will also work hard in my old age and do a good job in production. The people will always follow Chairman Mao!"
                                              Respectfully wishing you good health
                              All Heroes and Models of Ji'yuan County November 22nd
    Letter from All Employees of the Beijing Paper Mill
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We have good news from our factory on the production front of resisting America and aiding Korea to report to you. We have completed and exceeded the annual national planned quantity by the end of November, and from December onwards, everything will be overproduction. The quality has been improved from single-sided smooth to double-sided smooth. After the denunciation meeting, the daily output of Paper Machine No. 1 has created a new record, and this figure is unprecedented since the factory was built in 1939.
    In December, we will work hard to lay the foundation for next year's increased production tasks and express our will and determination with greater efforts and more achievements. With highest respect,
                                        Paper Industry Management Office, Central Ministry of Light Industry
                                        All Employees of the Beijing Paper Mill
    Letter from Employees of the Xiong'yue Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaodong
    Dear Chairman Mao:
    Since our Xiong'yue Farm was liberated from the long-term enemy-puppet rule in 1947, it has been restored and revitalized from its incomplete state under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. We are celebrating the peaceful construction of the motherland, doing our best to build this farm into a new-type people's farm of the New Democracy. However, the heinous American imperialists dared to further their ambition to enslave the world by invading our Taiwan, invading Korea, and bombing our territory, killing our people in Liaodong. With extreme hatred, in order to resist the atrocities of American imperialism with practical actions, we launched an autumn harvest competition to resist America and aid Korea in mid-August. This allowed us to complete the autumn harvest half a month earlier than last year; work efficiency increased by an average of more than 30% compared to last year, and some even increased by 70%. Recently, we also organized a 50-member workers' armed patrol team to study military affairs. At the general meeting of all employees to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, we all swore to you: "We will contribute everything we have to the motherland and our leader, Chairman Mao, strive to improve agricultural technology, increase national defense strength, and support the victory of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country."
    Our technical personnel have further advanced and used Michurin's breeding method to successfully cultivate four excellent rice varieties that are currently being bred. All employees wish to name them: "Resist America," "Aid Korea," "Protect the Home," and "Defend the Country." These four varieties greatly exceed the quality and yield of the Tian Tai, Mirong, and Luyu 132, which were considered the best varieties during the enemy-puppet period.
    Dear Chairman Mao! The more we feel that our motherland is threatened by the enemy, the more we feel close to you. With the Communist Party, we have a reliance. With you, we will surely win!
          With the highest respect to the working class!
                              Xiong'yue Agricultural Experiment Station, Liaodong
                                November 25, 1950
    Letter from Labor Model Kuang Fanli of Yongxin County, Jiangxi
    Dearest Chairman Mao:
    I was honored to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference. For a rural woman like me, who was looked down upon in feudal society, to receive such an honor would have been impossible without your and the Communist Party's correct leadership. Therefore, I am truly indescribably happy. Now I will report to you the general situation since I left Beijing:
    I left Beijing on October 7th and returned home (Yongxin, Jiangxi) on the 23rd; along the way, I received warm welcomes and receptions from local organizations and groups. At these welcoming meetings and receptions, I gave brief reports on the situation in Beijing and Chairman Mao's good health, and everyone applauded warmly when they heard it. At the same time, I reported at these meetings on the unparalleled strength of our national defense forces that I saw with my own eyes in Beijing on October 1st, and everyone was very happy.
    When I returned home, it was the time of the autumn grain collection. In order to complete the autumn grain collection task as soon as possible and carry out land reform, I dried and cleaned my own public grain (totaling 690 *jin*) and handed it over to the government on the second day. At the same time, in order to assist the government's work, in addition to directly participating in propaganda and mobilization and helping the masses to dry grain, I also asked my sixteen-year-old daughter to participate in militia work to help the masses deliver grain. We personally carried grain for the masses and took care of the warehouse. We left home before dawn every day and did not return until midnight. Once, my daughter and I took the lead in helping the Ci Society transport grain to a place eight *li* away, which influenced many people to follow suit. As a result, the 2,000-plus *jin* task of that Ci Society was completed that day. All the public grain in the township, except for a few special households, was delivered to the warehouse within five days. After the autumn grain collection was completed, my daughter won the title of autumn grain collection model.
    In addition to assisting the government's work, we did not slack off in the slightest in household production and mobilizing the masses for autumn harvest and winter plowing. After I returned home, I had already planted seven *mu* of land (rapeseed, radish, etc.). Now I plan to collect forty *dan* of manure this year as winter plowing fertilizer. Every night, I participate in various township meetings to carry out production propaganda, explaining the principle that it is most glorious to become wealthy through labor, and calling on them to process and fertilize, which basically improved the enthusiasm of the masses for production, and at the same time dispelled some ideological concerns about production in the past. Now every household is busy with winter plowing, and the fields of red flowers, rapeseed, broad beans and other crops are growing green and lush, and the harvest next year is expected to be very good.
    Now our Yongxin County has fully launched the land reform work. In addition to having my daughter participate in the land reform training class to prepare her to participate in the land reform work, I myself also participated in this county-wide People's Representative Conference. At this meeting, I also reported to the representatives on the situation in Beijing and your call. After hearing this, they all expressed their determination to respond to your call, actively do a good job in land reform, intensify production, expand county and district armed forces, and protect local security, in order to express their patriotic enthusiasm and determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country with practical actions.
    Now I am going back, preparing to assist the government in organizing the militia, expanding the county and district armed forces, and leading women to do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers (making a pair of shoes myself and preparing to donate other items), and also planning to mobilize the masses to reclaim wasteland. I myself plan to reclaim two *mu*.
          With revolutionary respect,
          Kuang Fanli November 24, 1950, in Yongxin, Jiangxi
    Letter from Huang Yaopin, Labor Model Representative of Southern Jiangsu
    Chairman Mao:
    The cadres here are now actively leading the peasants in carrying out land reform work. The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has also been launched. Now there are more than fifty people who have requested to go to Korea. They are all volunteers. Many people are anxiously asking me: When are we leaving? Has it not been approved yet?
    I am currently participating in an enlarged cadre meeting in the county. My view on the current situation is: The American aggressors are bound to be defeated by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. I will definitely intensify my work in the future and lead the masses to do a good job in land reform.
                            Huang Yaopin, Representative of Southern Jiangsu Region to the National Labor Model Conference
                                                  December 6th

    加紧生产抗美援朝
    各地人民写信给毛主席         
    报告生产战线上新的爱国成就
    长春人民代表会议全体代表的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们长春县第三次人民代表会议全体代表首先感谢您和共产党的英明领导。今年全县丰收，每垧地可打五、六石，我们住着温暖的房子。男女老小也都穿上了棉衣，吃水不忘掏井人，我们一辈子也忘不了您和共产党的恩情。最近我们听到了丧尽人性的美国帝国主义屠杀朝鲜人民的暴行：我们心中发酸，气愤万分，我们联想到过去十四年来日本帝国主义给我们带来的各种痛苦。我们全体向您宣誓：保证做好如下工作：第一、进行时事宣传，彻底揭露美帝的侵略罪行。第二、准备好马、车和人，随时准备到朝鲜去与朝鲜人民并肩作战。第三、选好粮食，送完爱国粮。第四、动员全县群众作好一九五一年的生产准备工作，要在今年每垧地二千五百斤的基础上再增加五百斤。
                            长春县第三次人民代表会议全体代表
                                              十一月二十八日
    济源县全体英雄模范的信敬爱的毛主席：
    自去年您提出了增产号召以后，济源人民生活已走向富裕，请看看一年生产的礼物：去年有七万亩水地，今年增加到十万亩，去年三万七千头牲口，今年增至五万二千头。去年植棉四万九千亩，约产棉四十九万斤，今年植棉五万三千亩，产棉九十五万四千斤。去年产麦十七万石（因有灾荒）；今年增至二十六万石。去年产秋粮二十二万石；今年增至三十三万石。去年大农具十一万九千五百件，今年增至二十余万件。这些成绩的取得，是由您英明的领导、政策正确。
    这次会议，我们学习了时事，认识了中国与朝鲜是唇齿关系，及美帝的罪恶行为，一致表示：“前方需要啥？我们就管啥！要人有人；要粮有粮；要钱有钱，那怕我们在后方吃糠吃菜；也要供给前线，打垮美帝国主义。”李老太太已六十六岁了，她说：“一定写信给毛主席，我也要卖卖老，搞好生产，人民永远跟着毛主席走！”
                                              敬祝身体健康
                              济源县全体英模上  十一月二十二日
    北京造纸厂全体职工的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们厂在抗美援朝的生产战线上有一个好消息向你报告，我们已在十一月底提前完成并超过了本年度国家计划量的全部，由十二月始将都是超额生产。品质并由单面光改进为两面光，在控诉大会以后，一号纸机的日产量又创造了新纪录，而这次数字是自一九三九年建厂以来从未有过的。
    十二月份我们努力打下明年增产任务的基础，以更大的努力及更多的成绩来表示我们的意志与决心。谨致崇高的敬礼

                                        理处北京造纸厂全体职工
    辽东熊岳农事试验场职工的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我们熊岳农场自一九四七年从长期敌伪统治下得到解放以后，四年来在共产党与人民政府正确的领导下，已把日本法西斯与国民党匪帮破坏相当严重的农场，从残缺不全中恢复了，复活了。我们正庆在祖国的和平建设中，尽力把这个农场建设为一个新民主主义的新型的人民的农场时，万恶的美帝国主义竟敢把奴役全世界的野心进一步地侵略我台湾，侵略朝鲜，空袭我领土，炸杀我辽东人民，我们在万分痛恨下，为了以实际行动来反抗美帝的暴行，自八月中旬起即掀起了抗美援朝的秋收竞赛。这样就使我们秋收工作比去年提前半月完成；工作效率较去年平均提高了３０％以上，有的竟提高到７０％。最近我们又组织了五十名工人武装纠察队，学习军事，在全场职工抗美援朝保家卫国的决心大会上我们都向着你宣了誓：“我们要为祖国和我们的领袖毛主席贡献出我们的一切，努力提高农业技术增加国防力量，支援抗美援朝保家卫国的胜利。”
    我们技术人员更以此种精神已将正在育成中的四个水稻优良品种，用米邱林的育种法提前培育成功了，全体职工愿把它定名为：“抗美”“援朝”“保家”“卫国”，这四个品种在质量上、产量上均大大超过敌伪时认为最优良的品种田泰，弥荣，和陆羽一三二号。
    亲爱的毛主席！我们感觉越当祖国受到敌人威胁时，我们越感觉对你亲切，有了共产党我们就有了依靠，有了你我们就一定会胜利！
          致以工人阶级的崇高敬礼！
                              辽东熊岳农事试验场全体职工启

    江西永新县劳模矌凡里的信最亲爱的毛主席：
    这次我光荣的出席了全国劳模代表会议，像我这样一个在封建社会里被人所瞧不起的农村女人，能够得到这样的光荣，要不是你和共产党的正确领导，是万万不能办到的。因此我心里真有说不出的高兴，现在将我离开北京以后的大概情形向你报告一下：
    我是十月七日离开北京的，二十三日就回到了家里（江西永新）；一路上受到各地机关团体的热烈欢迎和招待。在这些欢迎会和招待会上，我曾把北京的情况和毛主席的身体健康，作了简单的报告，大家听了，都热烈地鼓掌。同时在这些会上报告了十月一日我在北京所亲眼看到的国防力量的无比强大，大家都非常高兴。
    当我回到家里以后，那时正是秋征工作时期。为了早日完成秋征任务，以便进行土地改革，我在第二天就把自己的公粮（计六九○斤）晒干扬净交给政府，同时为了协助政府工作，除了我自己直接参加宣传动员，帮助群众晒谷以外，还叫我十六岁的女孩子也参加民兵工作，协助群众送粮。我们亲自替群众挑运，照顾仓库。每天天没有亮就出门，要到半夜才能回来。有一次我们母女二人曾带头到八里路以外的地方帮助祠会挑粮，因此影响了很多群众都跟着来，结果当天就完成了那个祠会的二千多斤任务。全乡的公粮除了少数特殊户以外，不到五天也都全部送交入仓。秋征完成后，我的女儿得了秋征模范。
    我们母女二人除协助政府工作，对于家里的生产和动员群众秋收冬耕工作，也丝毫没有放松。我回到家里以后，已种了七亩地（油菜、萝卜等）。现在我计划在今年内，要拾粪四十担，作为冬耕肥料。每天晚上我都要参加乡里的各种会议，向群众作生产宣传，说明劳动发家最光荣的道理，号召他们加工加肥，基本上提高了群众对生产的积极性，同时也打消了过去对生产上的某些思想顾虑。现在家家户户都忙着冬耕，满垅的红花、油菜、蚕豆等农作物都长得绿油油的非常茂盛，预料明年的收成一定很好。
    现在我们永新县已经全面展开了土地改革工作，我除了要我的女孩子参加土地改革训练班学习，准备让她参加土改工作外，我自己也参加了这次全县各界人民代表会议。在这个会上，我同样地将北京的情况和你的号召向代表作了报告。他们听了以后都表示坚决响应你的号召，积极做好土地改革工作，加紧生产，扩大县区武装，保卫地方治安，以实际行动来表示爱国热忱和抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。
    现在我回去，准备协助政府组织民兵，扩大县区武装，并领导妇女，做好优军优属工作（自己做一双鞋并准备赠送其他物品），此外并计划发动群众开垦荒地。我自己也计划开垦两亩。          致以革命的敬礼
          矌凡里敬启一九五○、十一、二十四日于江西永新
    苏南劳模代表黄耀品的信毛主席：
    我们这里的干部，现在都正积极领导农民，进行土地改革工作。抗美援朝保家卫国运动也已展开。现在已有五十多人要求到朝鲜去。他们都是志愿的。很多人着急地来问我：什么时候走？还没批准？
    我正在县里参加扩大干部会议。我对目前时局的看法是：美国侵略者必然要失败在中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军手里，我今后一定加紧工作，领导群众做好土改工作。
