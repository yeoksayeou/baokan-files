    Xinhua News Agency Report: Tens of thousands of experts, ships and vehicles converge on the Huai River Basin.
    Comprehensive Start of the Huai River Harnessing Winter Project
    Hundreds of Thousands of Laborers from Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu Flood the Riverbanks
    [This Newspaper’s dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: Hundreds of thousands of laborers from Henan Province, Northern Anhui Area, and Northern Jiangsu Area have already arrived at the front lines of the Huai River harnessing project, and the winter project for harnessing the Huai River has fully commenced. As of now, there are more than twenty construction sites along the entire Huai River, including the construction of flood storage depressions in Henan province in the upper reaches, the dredging of river channels and the restoration of dikes in Northern Anhui province in the middle reaches, and the construction of canal dikes in Northern Jiangsu province. According to reports from the local Huai River Harnessing Committees, the Chushan Dam and Bihu Dam in Northern Jiangsu, as well as the Laowangpo flood storage project in Henan, have been completed successively. The encirclement dike of the Huainan Coal Mine in Northern Anhui is nearing completion.
    In the construction areas, the laborers live in sheds, with cooking smoke rising everywhere, resembling new villages. In the larger construction zones, the sheds and team flags often stretch for more than ten miles. A large number of working women in the Huai River area also participated in the Huai River harnessing efforts. Like the men, they rolled up their trousers and shuttled back and forth on the construction site, carrying earth swiftly. Although the severe winter has already arrived in the Huai River Basin, thousands of farmers who depend on the fertile land on both sides of the Huai River for their livelihood are now enthusiastically starting this long-awaited and enormous project for the sake of their future better lives and in response to the call of the Central People's Government to fundamentally harness the Huai River.
    [This Newspaper’s dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: Thousands of hydraulic engineering experts and technical personnel, as well as tens of thousands of vehicles and ships, are converging from all directions in the Huai River Basin, carrying out busy survey and measurement work and transportation activities to fundamentally harness this historically disaster-prone river. Up and down the Huai River, from the Tongbai Mountains in Henan Province in the west to the coast of the Yellow Sea in Northern Jiangsu in the east, a magnificent picture of unprecedented river harnessing preparations in Chinese history is unfolding within an area of approximately 240,000 square kilometers.
    Most of the hydraulic engineering experts and technical personnel come from the southeastern provinces and major cities of China, including more than four hundred professors and students from various universities and specialized schools. The engineering team of the Water Conservancy Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, the engineering team of the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, the water conservancy, industrial, and geological departments of the Central People's Government, and the land and aerial survey departments of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission have also come from afar to provide support.
    Adapting to the upcoming huge engineering needs, millions of laborers in the three provinces along the Huai River have been mobilized and organized. The broad masses of the people believe in the Central People's Government's determination to fundamentally harness the Huai River, because they have seen how government cadres rescued tens of thousands of disaster victims from almost insurmountable difficulties after this year's flood; and how, during the autumn planting season, when there were no seeds in the vast disaster areas, the People's Government transported seeds from the Northeast and other places in a continuous stream. They have also seen that during the partial winter repairs of the Huai River last year, Bengbu alone completed one million cubic meters of earthwork, and this figure, completed in a short period, exceeded the total amount of earthwork completed by the Kuomintang era in eighteen years (during the eighteen years, the Kuomintang reactionary government completed a total of 800,000 cubic meters of Huai River harnessing projects around Bengbu). Therefore, they are confidently invigorated. Many farmers in the Huai River area sold their local products to purchase Huai River harnessing tools.
    In order to supply the large amount of material needed by the construction areas, trains, cars, carts, steamers, and sailboats loaded with grain and coal are rushing towards the Huai River area from all directions day and night. Many highways are being repaired on both sides of the Huai River, and many new telephone lines are being actively erected. Medical teams from various places are about to go to the construction areas to provide free treatment to the river workers. Xinhua Bookstore and cultural troupes will soon go to the construction areas with a large number of popular reading materials and wonderful programs for exhibition and performance.
    The 58 million people living in the Huai River Basin are preparing to enthusiastically participate in this historically unprecedented and enormous river harnessing project with boundless confidence in the new China.

    万千专家、船只、车辆云集淮河流域
    根治淮河冬季工程全面开始
    河南、皖北、苏北数十万民工涌上河岸
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：河南盛皖北区和苏北区的数十万民工，业已到达治淮前线，治淮的冬季工程已告全面开始。截至目前，淮河全线兴工的地区已有二十多处，包括上游河南境内修建蓄洪洼地，中游皖北境内疏浚河道和修复堤防，和苏北境内的培修运河堤防工程。根据各地到达治淮委员会的报告，苏北的褚山坝、壁虎坝两条堤防以及河南的老王坡蓄洪工程已经先后完成，即将完成的工程有皖北淮南煤矿的圈堤。
    兴工地区民工搭棚居住，炊烟缭绕，像新的村庄。稍为大一些的工区，工棚和队旗往往漫延十余里。沿淮地区大量的劳动妇女也参加了治淮行列，她们和男人一样卷起裤腿，穿梭似地在工地上飞快地抬土。目前虽然淮河流域的寒冬已经到来，但万千依靠着淮河两岸肥沃土地为生的农民，他们为着自己将来美好的生活，为着响应中央人民政府根治淮河的号召，正热情充沛地开始进行着这个他们向往已久的巨大工程。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：数以千计的水利专家和技术工程人员，以及上万的车辆和船只，正从四面八方云集在淮河流域，为根治这条历史上多灾多难的河流而进行着繁忙的勘察测量工作和运输活动。淮河上下，西起河南省的桐柏山区，东至苏北的黄海海岸，在大约二十四万平方公里的流域面积内，展开了一幅中国历史上空前的治河准备的宏伟图画。
    水利专家和技术工程人员大多数来自中国的东南各省和各大城市，其中四百余人是各大学各专科学校的教授和学生。中南军政委员会水利部工程队，珠江水利局工程队，中央人民政府的水利、工业、地质部门以及中央人民革命军事委员会的陆地、航空测量等部门，也都远道前来支援。
    适应着即将到来的庞大的工程需要，沿淮河三省数百万民工已经动员和组织起来。广大人民对中央人民政府根治淮河的决心是相信的，因为他们曾看到在今年水灾之后，政府的干部怎样从几乎是不可能克服的困难中把数万灾民抢救出来；秋种时节当广大灾区没有籽种时，人民政府从东北和其他各地源源运来了籽种。他们更看到在去年淮河部分冬修中，蚌埠一地就完成了一百万公方的土方，而这个在短短的期间内完成的数字是超过了国民党时代十八年的总数（十八年内国民党反动政府在蚌埠周围治淮工程总共完成八十万公方的土方）的。因此，他们充满信心地振奋起来。沿淮地区许多农民卖掉了自己的土产购买治淮工具。
    为了供应工区的大量物质需要，满载着粮食和煤炭的火车、汽车、大车、轮船、帆船从各个方向不分昼夜地向着淮河一带奔驰，许多公路在淮河两岸被修补起来，许多新的电话线路正在积极架设，来自各地的医疗队即将分赴施工地区为河工免费治疗，新华书店和文工团即将带着大批的通俗读物和精彩节目分赴工区展览和演出。
    居住在淮河流域的五千八百万人民，正怀着对新中国的无限信心，准备热情地参加这一个历史上未有的巨大的治河工程。
