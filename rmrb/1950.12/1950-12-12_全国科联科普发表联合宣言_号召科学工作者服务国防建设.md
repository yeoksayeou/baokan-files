The National Federation of Natural Science Societies and the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization issued a joint declaration, calling on natural science and technology workers to actively participate in national defense construction. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, has continuously inflicted severe blows on the invading armies of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states in just and heroic battles, smashing the enemy's general offensive. The glorious and great victory of our People's Volunteer Army has inspired the people of all China, and also inspired all of China's scientific workers.

However, we must be vigilant. As U.S. imperialism approaches its dead end, it still has the possibility of expanding its frenzied war. Therefore, we resolutely support the joint decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council, calling on patriotic youth to bravely go to the glorious post of defending the motherland, cultivate a large number of revolutionary military talents, master modern military science knowledge, and accelerate the strengthening of our national defense forces.

Similarly, modern warfare is scientific warfare. Whether at the front or in the rear, scientific workers can certainly find their own work posts, serving national defense and the production front. For the sake of defending our motherland, we scientific workers across the country, like our patriotic young comrades, are willing to shift from peaceful construction work posts to the most urgently needed national defense and production front, strengthening our armed combat ranks. We are completely willing to obey the requirements for safeguarding the security of the motherland. Because only by strengthening national defense forces can we repel the adventurous incursions of the invaders and guarantee our peaceful construction, and our freedom and happiness.

We call on: The scientific workers of New China, unite as one, and concentrate all our strength on the work of consolidating the national defense of the motherland. Put our scientific knowledge at the service of the people's army, navy and air force, and at the service of all national defense and production front work.

We call on scientific workers all over the country, and all specialized societies across the country, to quickly organize and respond to all the calls of the motherland to us. All of China's scientific workers, under the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao, bravely act and strive for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

    号召科学工作者服务国防建设
    【本报讯】中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会发表联合宣言，号召自然科学及技术工作者积极参加国防建设。宣言全文如下：
    我抗美援朝的人民志愿部队，和朝鲜的人民军并肩作战，在正义的和英勇的战斗中，连续给予美帝及其仆从国家入侵军以严重的打击，粉碎了敌人的总攻势。我人民志愿部队光荣伟大的胜利，鼓舞了全中国的人民，也鼓舞了全中国的科学工作者。
    但是，我们必须提高警惕。当美帝走向穷途末路的时候，他们还有扩大疯狂性战争的可能。因此，我们坚决拥护人民革命军事委员会和政务院的联合决定。号召爱国青年，勇敢的走向保卫祖国的光荣岗位，以大量培养革命的军事人才，掌握现代化的军事科学知识，加速增强我国国防力量。
    同样的，现代的战争是科学的战争，无论在前线和后方，科学工作者，必然可以找到他自己的工作岗位，服务于国防和生产战线，我们全国的科学工作者，为着保卫自己的祖国，也和爱国的青年同志们一样，志愿从和平建设的工作岗位，转向目前最迫切需要的国防和生产战线，加强我们武装战斗的行列。我们完全志愿服从于保卫祖国安全的要求。因为只有加强国防力量，才能打退侵略者的冒险进犯，才能保障我们的和平建设，和我们的自由与幸福。
    我们号召：新中国的科学工作者，团结一致，把一切力量贯注在巩固祖国国防的工作中。把我们的科学知识服务于人民的陆军、海军和空军，服务于一切国防和生产战线的工作。
    我们号召全国各地的科学工作者，全国各专门学会，迅速组织起来，响应祖国对于我们的一切号召，全中国的科学工作者，在毛主席光辉的旗帜下勇敢的行动起来，为抗美援朝神圣的任务而奋斗。
