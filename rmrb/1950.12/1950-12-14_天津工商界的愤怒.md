    The Anger of Tianjin's Business Community
    Xu Ying
    November 30th. The streets were filled with dazzling flags, the streets were filled with the sounds of battle. More than 42,000 industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin solemnly held an unprecedented anti-American, aid-Korea, patriotic demonstration parade in the sub-zero 2.6 degree weather. The marching team was led by Li Zhuchen, an elder statesman in his seventies, leading all members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. In the ranks were master craftsmen in their seventies, young apprentices in their teens, managers, shopkeepers, and accountants; engineers, technical staff, men and women shop assistants. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, this torrent expressed its determination to unite and engage in the battle against imperialism. Patriotic fervor was boiling, enough to melt the floating ice in the Hai River. Sparks of hatred and confidence radiated from this ancient commercial port, illuminating the whole country. This parade was immediately welcomed by Chairman Mao and received a response from the industrial and commercial circles in the capital.
    It is no accident that China's industrial and commercial circles have demonstrated their determination to fight and their confidence in victory under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea in various places. In the experience of the past century, the industrial and commercial circles have recognized how the American imperialists, disguised as philanthropists, have harmed China's economic development, and still feel lingering pain when they touch their wounds. In particular, the long-standing industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin are full of experience in struggle in all ethnic enterprises. From a historical point of view, the aggressive bloody hands of American imperialism were first stretched out in the port of Tianjin. On June 25, 1859, before the Treaty of Tianjin, when the British imperialist gunboats attacked the Dagu port and were repulsed, the American fleet, which styled itself as a "mediator," participated as an accomplice, shouting "Blood is thicker than water," emphasizing the unity of the robbers in attacking colonies. Ninety years later, Tianjin has been liberated, and 500 million people across the country have such a lovely and powerful government. After the restoration of urban-rural relations and the lifting of the shackles of imperialist commodities, Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles began to see an unparalleled and brilliant future. At this time, the threat of American imperialist aggression arrived, not allowing us to turn over, not allowing us to get the hope we had not seen for a hundred years, and not allowing us to peacefully build our country. How can industrialists and businessmen, who account for one of the main components of the Chinese people, not be angry, how can they ignore it, how can they not take action? In particular, how can the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, who suffered the ravages of the United States earliest and have been increasing their scars for the past ninety years, endure it any longer without making a combat demonstration and roar?
    The more national entrepreneurs are, the more they feel the loveliness of today's country and the warmth of the policies. Li Zhuchen, the 70-year-old chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, is inseparable from the northern chemical enterprises. That day, he was the commander in the forefront in the biting north wind. Fan Xudong, a deceased friend who created "Jiuda," "Yongli," and "Huanghai" with him in Tianjin, held the lofty ambition of "chemical industry conquering the ocean," but on the eve of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he was suffocated by the Chiang Kai-shek's four major families for the sake of his career. Another old friend, Hou Debang, the inventor of the world-renowned "Hou's alkali production method," also fought against imperialist commodities such as Brunner Mond for half his life. Only today has the People's Government given full play to his heroic talents. As early as last year, at the opening of the industrial exhibition held in Tianjin for urban-rural exchange, Li Zhuchen said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries have only destroyed for thirty or forty years, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, everything has been restored in one year." These words expressed his excitement. Zhu Jisheng, the vice chairman, who presides over the Renli Woolen Company, was able to transform it into industrial wool for the service of the people only after liberation. When the imperialists spread rumors that large cities would become a burden to the Communist Party, he solemnly denounced such absurdities to Chinese and foreign friends, saying that he believed that in the hands of the Chinese, industry and commerce would soon be revived. During this parade, he had already requested action, saying that he must stand in the forefront and request to hold up a flag. Bi Mingqi, the vice chairman, repeatedly said to people that only the People's Government truly cares for the industrial and commercial circles. He is the leader in paying taxes every year, and he is the creator of establishing price control groups in the import and export industry. After the trade conference, he and a group of attendees returned excitedly, saying, "The People's Government has truly achieved both public and private benefits and benefits for both labor and capital. It depends on our own efforts." Many leading industrialists and businessmen also have the same feelings. But the American imperialists are trying to create "democratic individualists" and put on shackles again. That is simply a dream.
    Every industrialist and businessman in Tianjin was in an extremely excited mood to get through the wheat harvest, welcome the autumn harvest, and welcome this year's bumper harvest. With the state's processing and ordering, plus our own strength, we can stand up. We need peace the most for the recovery and development of our industry. This short year has brought about fundamental changes. The people have already eliminated the monopolized commodities of the USA brought about by the evil American imperialism through "commercial treaties," "relief," and "surplus materials" through the reactionary Kuomintang government. Today, in the streets and alleys, those daily necessities, nylon stockings, toothbrushes, belts, various milk powders, Camel Red Light cigarettes, matches, writing paper, and various consumables that have devastated our national industry are impossible to come again. The hyperinflation of the past twelve years has disappeared like a myth. Speculation and profiteering a year ago also seems to have become something of the past.
    Today, every industry in the industrial and commercial circles has seen "improvement," not only on the books, but also in their minds. No one has new experience, but they cannot help but welcome this new reality with an unprecedentedly good mood. Farmers' cargo ships arrive in Tianjin and cannot find a wharf to unload their goods. The returning cargo is limited, and the shipping price downstream is higher than upstream. Small and medium-sized industries are concentrated in the ninth district and are thriving. Hawkers on Houjia Back Street along the river are wholesaling in hundreds. The ironware industry on Santiaoshi Street is dinging and banging day and night. The iron pots that have just come out of the furnace are snatched away by people who have ordered them before they have cooled down. In the gauze industry, more than 40 of the closed Inner Bureau have reopened. Businessmen generally register with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to increase their capital. Industrialists' production is somewhat in short supply. Even unpopular goods have customers. This is a new situation of urban-rural exchange after the land reform. A new and vast market has unfolded before the eyes of the new industrial and commercial circles. This new good life can only be obtained by defeating the aggression of imperialism.
    The ambition of the American imperialists to come again has been exposed. Invading Taiwan, invading Korea, bombing our borders, and using various rogue methods to carry out intimidation have step by step promoted the general awakening of Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen. The ancient city of Tianjin is slowly draped in military uniform, and industrialists and businessmen also recognize that if the Chinese people do not rise up to resist American imperialist aggression, our stable and happy life will be destroyed by the crazy aggression of the United States. On the tall buildings of the industrial and commercial enterprises on Roosevelt Road, red cloth banners stretched straight from the roof to the ground, reading: "Down with American imperialism!" "Salute the heroic Korean people!" The walls of Xinhua Building are covered with painted histories of American imperialism's invasion of China. A cartoon several feet high opposite Quanye Chang points out that the United States is following the old path of Japanese invaders. The illuminated words on the roof of the department store, "Aiding Korea is defending ourselves," shine far away. Some stores are decorated even more fervently inside than on the streets. In the windows of the Zhongyuan Company, on the pillars, on the various goods, and on the steps of the stairs are covered with slogans. Here, a long string of shirts is hung with more than twenty words, "Resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement that the American imperialist aggression against Korea cannot be ignored." Over there, bed sheets, socks, and candies make up "The invincible alliance of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union" and "The American imperialist aggression against Korea is the preparatory step for the aggression against China." Small shops and stalls are also plastered with "Resist America and Aid Korea" and "Protect the Home and Defend the Country." Tianjin was not backward during the Anti-Japanese War. This kind of street scene is woven with the people's vigilance, anger, hatred, and determination to fight. This is the foundation for the report to Chairman Mao at this patriotic demonstration parade. They all unanimously said:
    "Today we are holding another demonstration parade of more than 40,000 people to tell the American imperialists that we have recognized their aggressive nature, and all strata of the country have united to fight to the end to complete the sacred task of resisting America and aiding Korea and protecting the home and defending the country."
    The enthusiasm of Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen in resisting America and aiding Korea fully confirms that it is directly proportional to the aggression and oppression imposed on Tianjin by imperialists and their accomplices for nearly a hundred years. The original industrial production, finance, trade, and even the entire economic system served the imperialist economy. In addition, the annexation and devastation of the four major families before liberation made the existing production tools and product specifications insufficient to meet the needs of the people in the face of huge purchasing power today. The inner pain and incomplete conditions make the patriotic industrialists and businessmen feel more and more the disasters brought to them by the imperialists in the past when they want to do their tasks, thus increasing their anger and determination to fight. Not only the industrial and commercial circles, but also the general people of Tianjin, under this century-old tradition of suffering, are not willing to lag behind. For example, after the volunteer troops arrived at the front, the volunteer medical teams, mainly composed of private doctors, also went to the front line. There are also a thousand reservists waiting to depart. Under the call of national defense construction, young workers and students have stepped onto glorious posts. In this demonstration parade of more than 42,000 people, well-known industrialists and businessmen, as well as 3,000 vendors, jointly participated in the review led by the government and made a solemn oath. In order to carry out anger into action, they use the following four specific tasks as the norm for future actions:
    1. Contribute all our strength to support the volunteer action to resist America and aid Korea;
    2. Stick to our jobs, ensure active management, and do a good job in production;
    3. Resolutely support government policies and laws, ensure stable prices, oppose hoarding and speculation;
    4. Strengthen the study of current affairs, recognize the current situation, expand publicity, unify thoughts, recognize enemies and friends, and do not listen to rumors from reactionary elements.
    Chairman Mao replied to the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin on December 2, welcoming the patriotic parade of the industrial and commercial circles. This reply gave the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin and even the industrial and commercial circles across the country unparalleled encouragement. Industrialists and businessmen are following Chairman Mao's instructions and forming a more solid united front with the people than in the past to oppose imperialist aggression, and are moving towards the final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. After the great victory of the liberation of Pyongyang, Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen and the people of the city launched in-depth consolation and production work, which is also a step towards winning the final victory.

    天津工商界的愤怒
    徐盈
    十一月三十日。满街都是耀目的旗帜，满街都是战斗的声音。天津市四万二千多工商业者在零下二度六的天气里壮严地举行了史无前例的抗美援朝爱国示威大游行。游行队伍以古稀老人李烛尘率领全体工商联委员为先导。队伍中有七十多岁的老师傅，有十几岁的小徒弟，有经理，有掌柜，有帐房先生；有工程师，有技术员工，有男女伙友。这一支洪流在毛泽东的旗帜下，表示了团结起来从事于反对帝国主义的战斗的决心，爱国的热情沸腾着，足以融尽了海河中飘浮着的冰块。交织着愤恨和信心的火花，从这个古老的商埠放射出去，照亮了全国。这个游行立即得到毛主席的欢迎及首都工商界的响应。
    中国的工商界在各地的抗美援朝的旗帜下都表现出了战斗的决心与胜利的信心，这并非偶然的事。工商界在百年来的经历中，认识了伪装慈善家的美帝国主义怎样戕害着中国经济的发展，抚摩着创伤，还感觉到余痛。特别是天津的历史悠久的工商界，凡属民族性质的企业，更是充满了斗争的经验。从历史上看，美帝国主义的侵略血手最早就是在天津的口岸伸出来的，一八五九年六月二十五日，天津条约以前，英帝国主义者的炮舰进攻大沽口岸被反击时，以“调人”自命的美帝舰队在那里参加帮凶，并高喊着“血比水浓”，强调强盗们对殖民地进攻的一致。九十年后，天津已经解放了，全国五万万人又有了这么可爱而又强有力的政府。在城乡关系恢复，帝国主义商品的锁枷解除之后，天津工商界开始看到了无比辉煌的前途。这时候美帝国主义者侵略的威胁到来了，不让我们翻身，不让我们得到百年看不到的希望，不让我们和平建设我们的国家。占了中国人民主要成分之一的工商业者又怎能不为之愤怒，怎能置之不理，怎能不行动起来？特别是最早遭受过美帝的蹂躏而九十年来一直在增加创疤的天津工商业者又怎能再忍耐下去而不作战斗的示威与怒吼？
    越是民族企业家才越感受到今天的国家的可爱，政策的温暖，七十岁的天津工商联主委李烛尘与北方化工企业是不可分的，他那天是在朔风凛冽中站在最前列的总指挥。和他一起在天津创造“久大”“永利”“黄海”的亡友范旭东，抱着“化工征服海洋”的壮志，到了抗战胜利的前夕，竟为了事业被蒋介石四大家族所窒死。另一老友侯德榜，全世界知名的“侯氏制碱法”发明人，也是与帝国主义商品如卜内门等搏斗半生，到了今天，人民政府才使他英雄有了充分的用武之地。李烛尘早在去年天津为城乡交流而举办的工业展览会开幕时便说：“国民党反动派三四十年只有破坏，在共产党领导下一年就全恢复了。”这句话表现出他的满怀兴奋来。副主委朱继圣所主持的仁立毛呢公司是到解放后才能改制为工业用呢为人民服务，当帝国主义者造谣大城市将成为共产党的包袱时，他便对中外友人郑重地痛斥这类的滥调，他说他相信在中国人手中，工商业很快的就复兴了。当这次游行时，他早就要求行动道，他一定站在最前列而且要求高举一面旗帜。副主委毕鸣歧一再对人说，只有人民政府才真正照顾到工商界，他是每届缴纳税款的带头者，他是出进口业中建立掌握价格小组的创造者，当贸易会议过后，他和一批出席归来者满怀兴奋地说，“人民政府是真正作到公私兼顾劳资两利了，就看我们自己的努力了。”多少带头的工商业家也都是作同样的感想。但是美帝国主义者却在妄想制造“民主个人主义者”，重上锁枷，那简直是在作梦了。
    天津每一个工商业者本是以极端兴奋的心情过了麦收，迎接大秋，迎接今年的丰收。国家的加工与订货，加上自己本身的力量，已能站起来了。我们是最需要和平的，为了我们工业的恢复与发展。这短短的一年起了基本的变化，人民在市场上已然消灭了无恶不做的美帝国主义以“商约”“救济”“剩余物资”通过反动的国民党政府而带来的ＵＳＡ的独占商品。今天的大街小巷上，那些摧残我们民族工业的日用百货，玻璃丝袜、牙刷、腰带、各式奶粉、骆驼红光香烟、火柴便纸，以及各种消耗用品是不可能再来了，十二年来的通货膨胀已像是神话似的一去不复返了，一年以前的投机倒把，好像也成为多少年前的旧事了。
    今天工商界的每一个行业都看到了“好转”，不只是帐面上的，而且是思想上的。谁都没有新的经验，但是不能不以从来没有过的好心气来迎接这新的现实；农民的货船来到天津，找不到下货的码头；回头的货有限，下水的运价反比上水高了，中小工业集中第九区繁荣起来，沿河的侯家后街的摊贩都在成百打地批售，铁器业的三条石街昼夜叮叮当当，出炉的铁锅没有冷透，就被订货的人抢走，纱布业已经歇业的内局，有四十多家重张了。商业家普遍到工商局里登记增资，工业家的生产有点供不应求，冷门货也有了主顾，这就是土改以后，一个城乡交流的新局势，新的广大市场已展开在新的工商界的眼前了。这个新的好日子是只有打垮了帝国主义的侵略才能得到的。
    美帝国主义者企图再来的野心暴露了。侵略台湾侵略朝鲜，轰炸我们的边境，以及用各种流氓手段进行恐吓，一步一步地更促成了天津工商业者的普遍觉醒。古老的天津市慢慢地披上了戎装，工商业者也认识了：中国人民若不奋起反抗美帝侵略，我们安定幸福的生活必为美帝的疯狂侵略所破坏。罗斯福路工商业的高大的建筑物上，从楼顶直扯到地面的红布标语上写着：“打倒美帝国主义！”“向英勇的朝鲜人民致敬！”新华大楼墙上贴满了美帝侵华画史。劝业场对面高达数丈的漫画，其中之一指着美帝正遵循日寇侵华的老路前进。百货公司的门前，代表中国的巨人，正在斩断一连贯ＵＳ组成的长蛇，楼顶上的灯字“援助朝鲜就是保卫自己”，照到遥远的地方。有些商店的内部装饰得比街头还要火炽。中原公司的橱窗里，柱子上，各色货物上，以及楼梯的台阶上都贴满了标语。这边，一长串衬衣上挂着二十多个字“坚决拥护周外长对美帝侵略朝鲜不能置之不理的声明”，那边床单上，袜子和糖果组成了“中苏两大国同盟无敌于天下”，和“美帝侵略朝鲜就是侵略中国的准备步骤”。小商店以及摊贩的现成物品上也都贴满了“抗美援朝”“保家卫国”。天津在抗日斗争时候就是不落后的，这样街头的景象，是人民用警惕、愤怒、憎恨和斗争的决心交织而成的，这就是这次爱国示威大游行上给毛主席的报告的基础，全体一致地说：
    “今天我们又举行四万余人的示威大游行，告诉美帝，我们已经认清了它们的侵略本质，全国各阶层都已团结一致，共同为完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗到底。”
    天津的工商业家的抗美援朝的积极性，充分证实了是与近百年来帝国主义者及其帮凶所加于天津的侵略与压榨成了正比例。原有的工业生产金融贸易乃至整个的经济体系是为帝国主义经济服务的，加以解放前四大家族的鲸吞与摧残，使今天面临巨大购买力的来到，不论生产工具与产品规格都不足以应付人民的需要。内心的痛楚及不完整的条件，使爱国的工商业家越想尽自己的任务时，便越感到帝国主义者过去带给他们的灾难，而增加了愤恨与战斗的决心，不只是工商界，天津的一般人民在这个百年苦难的传统下，也是不甘落后的，如志愿部队到了前方以后，以私人医师为主的志愿医疗队也就跟着上了前线。还有一千名后备军待命出发。在国防建设的号召下，青年工人、学生纷纷走上光荣的岗位。就在这次四万二千多人的示威游行中，也是包括了自知名的工商业家，以至三千摊贩，共同参加了政府领导的检阅并作庄严的宣誓。为了把愤怒贯彻到行动中，他们以下列四项具体的任务作为今后行动的圭范：
    一、贡献一切力量，支援抗美援朝的志愿行动；
    二、坚守工作岗位，保证积极经营，搞好生产；
    三、坚决支持政府政策法令，保证稳定物价，反对囤积居奇，投机倒把；
    四、加强时事学习，认清目前形势，扩大宣传，统一思想，认清敌友，不听反动分子造谣。
    毛主席在十二月二日电复天津工商业界，欢迎工商界爱国游行。这覆电给予天津工商界以至全国工商界以无比的鼓励。工商业家正在遵照毛主席的指示和人民大众结成比过去更巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，走向反帝斗争的最后胜利。在平壤光复大捷后，天津工商业家和全市人民一道展开了深入的慰劳与生产工作，这也就是争取最后胜利的步骤。（十二月十日）
