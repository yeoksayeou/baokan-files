Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: Representatives of various ethnic minorities in the Southwest region have participated in democratic nation-building efforts at all levels. As of mid-November, people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups have been successively convened once or twice in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and other provinces. The number of representatives attending the meetings was elected according to the proportion of the ethnic minority population in each region. In Yunnan's Nanqiao, Lancang, and other counties, ethnic minority representatives accounted for more than two-thirds of all representatives. Among the more than 200 representatives at the Kangding People's Representative Conference in Xikang, representatives of the Tibetan, Hui, and Yi ethnic groups accounted for 124. Before the meetings, people of all ethnic minorities enthusiastically and conscientiously selected their representatives. For example, the Yi, Akha, and Lahu people in Fo Hai and other counties in Yunnan held mass meetings village by village to carefully elect their representatives. The Kawa prince and the chiefs of Kawa Mountain in Lancang County (leaders of the Kawa ethnic group), in order to express their joy in participating in the People's Representative Conference, held a grand ceremony of "darting the ox" (killing the ox with darts and dividing the meat to show unity and harmony), and then traveled over mountains and rivers to the county seat to attend the meeting. At the ethnic and cross-sector representative conferences held in various places, the representatives, wearing festive costumes, excitedly described their joy since liberation. They said: "In the past, we were only bound and escorted to the yamen. Today, the Communist Party has come, and we are sitting in the hall!"
	People's governments at all levels have extensively absorbed ethnic minority cadres to participate in the construction of political power. According to incomplete statistics, there are already about 2,000 ethnic minority cadres working in township-level or higher-level political power organs in the Southwest region. Among them, there are 476 ethnic minority cadres in Guizhou prefectural and county-level institutions alone; 32 ethnic minority cadres serve as heads, deputy heads, commissioners of the 12 prefectures and 130 cities and counties in Yunnan Province.
	In order to actively train ethnic minority cadres, the people's governments in various places in the Southwest Administrative Region have begun to hold ethnic minority cadre training classes. Among them, the training classes held by Ning'er and Mengzi prefectures in Yunnan Province have more than 100 ethnic minority students participating in the study.
	Xinhua News Agency, Xichang: The People's Government of Yuexi County in eastern Xikang has abolished all kinds of inscriptions and place names that insulted Yi compatriots by reactionary rulers of the past.
	Yuexi County is an area inhabited by the Yi people in eastern Xikang. Reactionary rulers of the past had repeatedly massacred innocent Yi compatriots in the area and left behind various "merit steles" praising the executioners' crimes of killing Yi compatriots. There were no less than dozens of inscriptions such as "Awe-Inspiring Pacification of the Yi" placed along major roads. The words "Yi people are not allowed to ride horses into the city" and "Yi people are not allowed to stay overnight in the city," carved on the four gates of Yuexi County during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, are still clearly visible. In addition, some towns and townships have also been renamed to insult the Yi compatriots, such as "Pingyi Fort" and "Zhenyi Fort." The Yuexi River Bridge was also named "Zhenyi Bridge."
	After the liberation of the area, the local people's government convened a people's representative conference of all ethnic groups. At the meeting, all the representatives unanimously resolved to abolish all reactionary inscriptions and place names that insulted the Yi people. The Yi people in various places were overjoyed after hearing the news. They picked up axes and hoes and smashed all kinds of reactionary inscriptions; and renamed "Zhenyi Bridge" as "Liberation Bridge" and "Pingyi Fort" as "Ping'an Fort."

    西南各族代表参加民主建政
    西康越嶲县废除侮辱彝胞碑记等
    【本报讯】据新华社重庆讯：西南地区各少数民族的代表人物参加了各级民主建政工作。截至十一月中旬止，云南、贵州、西康等省各少数民族聚居地区，已相继召开了一次到二次各族各界人民代表会议。出席会议的代表人数，均按各地少数民族人口比例推选。云南的南峤、澜沧等县少数民族代表，均占全体代表的三分之二以上；西康康定人民代表会议的二百余名代表中，藏族、回族、彝族等族的代表共占一百二十四名。在会议召开之前，各少数民族人民都热烈而认真地选派自己的代表。如云南佛海等县彝族、阿卡族、倮黑族等民族人民，逐寨逐村举行群众大会，慎重地选出自己的代表。澜沧县的卡瓦族王子及卡瓦山大小头人（该族领袖），为表示对参加人民代表会议的喜悦，曾举行隆重的镖牛典礼（将牛用镖刺死，分食其肉，以示团结和睦之意），然后翻山越岭赶至县城开会，在各地举行的各族各界代表会上，代表们穿着节日礼服，兴奋地述说着解放以后的喜悦。他们说：过去我们只有被捆绑着押进衙门的份儿，今天，共产党来了，我们也坐上了大堂！
    各级人民政府大量吸收少数民族干部参加政权建设工作。据不完全统计，西南区乡级以上政权机构中，已有两千名左右的少数民族干部参加工作，其中仅贵州专署与县级机构中，少数民族干部即有四百七十六人；云南省所属的十二个专区，一百三十个市、县中，担任正副县、市长和专员的少数民族干部亦达三十二人。
    为积极培养少数民族干部，西南大行政区各地人民政府已开始举办少数民族干部训练班，其中云南省宁洱、蒙自两专署举办的训练班中，参加学习的少数民族学员即有百余人左右。
    【本报讯】据新华社西昌电：西康东部越嶲县人民政府已废除历代反动统治者侮辱彝族同胞的各种碑记和地名。
    越嶲县系西康东部彝族人民聚居地区，历代反动统治者曾无数次屠杀该区无辜彝胞，并留下了各种歌颂刽子手杀戮彝胞罪行的“记功碑”。各大道旁留置的“威镇彝服”之类的碑记不下数十处。在清光绪年间于越嶲县四个城门刻下的“不准彝人骑马进城”，“不准彝人留歇城内”等字样，迄今仍清晰可辨。此外，部分乡镇亦被改为侮辱彝胞的名称。如“平彝堡”、“镇彝堡”等，越嶲河大桥也被命名为“镇彝桥”。
    该地解放后，当地人民政府曾召开了各族各界人民代表会议，会上全体代表一致决议废除侮辱彝族人民的一切反动碑记和地名。各地彝族人民闻悉后欢欣若狂，他们纷纷拿起斧子、镢头，将各种反动碑记尽行打碎；并把“镇彝桥”更名为“解放桥”、“平彝堡”更名为“平安堡”。
