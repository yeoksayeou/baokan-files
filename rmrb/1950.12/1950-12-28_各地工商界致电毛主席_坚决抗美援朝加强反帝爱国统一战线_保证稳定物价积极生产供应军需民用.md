(Reported by this newspaper) Following the anti-American and aid-Korea parade and demonstration held by the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, and a telegram sent to Chairman Mao Zedong, industrial and commercial circles in many cities across the country have successively held parades and demonstrations and sent telegrams to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea. In addition to the telegrams from the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Guilin, Qingdao, Xi'an, Shanghai, and other places to Chairman Mao, which have been published successively in this newspaper, the telegrams received from the industrial and commercial circles in other cities are now published as follows:

    The industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 12th, saying: The American imperialists have frantically and shamelessly launched a war of aggression against Korea and armed occupation of Taiwan. The series of cruel and despicable acts of aggression in the past few months have aroused immense indignation among the 475 million people of China. The people across the country have voluntarily and consciously set off a surge of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, and are determined to shatter the American imperialists' dream of aggression with practical actions.

    The entire industrial and commercial community of Wuhan has recognized the current situation and their own tasks. At an enlarged conference convened by the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in late November, they passed ten resolutions to fight for resisting America and aiding Korea, and unanimously guaranteed their implementation.

    In order to demonstrate the spirit of patriotism of the industrial and commercial community in Wuhan and to express the practical actions of resisting America and aiding Korea in a more magnificent and collective way, we held an 80,000-person demonstration and parade of the industrial and commercial community in Wuhan today to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang and to resist America and aid Korea, giving the American imperialists another heavy blow, telling them the great strength of the firm unity of the patriotic military and civilians of China and Korea. We must tear this paper tiger to pieces. Victory will surely belong to the people of China and Korea and the oppressed people of all Asia. We, the industrial and commercial circles of Wuhan, sincerely guarantee to you that we will take practical actions to curb speculation, stabilize prices, pay taxes on time, actively produce, and work together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to fight to overthrow American imperialism, eliminate bandits, special agents, and local bullies, and eliminate the landlord class.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Tunxi telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 8th, saying: We are fortunate to be moving towards prosperity and strength under your wise leadership, but the hateful and shameless American imperialists are launching unreasonable provocations against us at this time. This bold and reckless action has aroused our infinite indignation and deepened our basic understanding of American imperialism. Now, the industrial and commercial circles in Tunxi City are determined to take unified action to oppose this unreasonable aggression and have established our four specific tasks:

    (1) Complete tax collection. (2) Strictly abide by government laws and decrees. (3) Work hard to produce and facilitate the flow of materials. (4) Strengthen learning and recognize enemies and friends.

    We also guarantee to do it in practice. We want to let the American imperialists know that the Chinese people today are absolutely not afraid of any threats or intimidation, and that we are even more united in the face of dangerous enemies. Today, we held a mobilization meeting and a large-scale demonstration parade of the city's industrial and commercial circles. At the meeting, we unanimously swore to fight to the end for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Beihai telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 9th, saying: Thanks to your wise leadership and the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the whole of China has been liberated. Today is the anniversary of the liberation of Beihai. We celebrate this great day with boundless joy. However, the American imperialists' actions of aggression against Korea have expanded their ambitions of aggression, and the flames of war have spread to our country's borders. In the nationwide movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, we respond to this call and are determined to fight to defend world peace, to defend our country, and to support our Korean brothers. We unanimously support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou and the joint declaration of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, and assume the glorious task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country; at the same time, we sign a covenant to jointly abide by it, guaranteeing to make practical efforts to develop industry and commerce and to improve production in order to complete the construction of the new economy.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Lushun-Dalian telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 10th, saying: Under your wise leadership, the private industry and commerce of Lushun-Dalian, under the leadership of the People's Government and the strong support of state-owned enterprises, have completely changed the miserable situation under Japanese rule in five years, and have been developing and prospering day by day. However, while we were engaged in peaceful business, the American imperialists launched a frantic war of aggression against us and carried out deception and intimidation against the people. The entire industrial and commercial community of Lushun-Dalian has recognized the aggressive nature of American imperialism. We will never be intimidated by them. We must respond to the instructions in your telegram to the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin to "form a united front against imperialism that is more consolidated than in the past together with the masses of the people," unite with people of all classes, and jointly strive to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. Chairman Mao, the industrial and commercial community of Lushun-Dalian sincerely reports to you that in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, we are determined to participate in this sacred task with practical actions. A few days ago, when the Lushun-Dalian area implemented the 1950 second-term production and construction unit-linked public bonds issued by the Northeast People's Government, we overfulfilled the planned target in only eight days, selling a total of more than 620,000 shares. On November 30, we received the notification of the November business tax, and on the morning of December 1, all 8,942 taxpayers in the city paid all the taxes in one morning. We unanimously believe that only in this way can we strengthen the economic power of the new China, consolidate our national defense, and effectively defend our country's borders. Chairman Mao, we guarantee to you in the future: (1) Contribute all our strength to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. (2) Step up production, facilitate the exchange of materials, and ensure military and civilian needs. (3) Abide by the policies and laws of the People's Government, ensure stable prices, and do not engage in speculation or tax evasion. (4) Strengthen current affairs learning, recognize enemies and friends, and do not listen to the rumors and deceptions of American imperialism and bandits. (5) Protect production tools and warehouse materials, and strictly prevent sabotage by bandits.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Anshan telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 10th, saying: American imperialism has savagely invaded Korea and further invaded our country's territory, endangering the lives and property of our people. In order to crush the American imperialists' dream of aggression and to settle the blood debt they have owed China for nearly a century, we vow to unite with people from all walks of life and resolutely contribute all our strength to defend our homeland and our country to the end. The representatives of all industries and businesses in the city have jointly formulated seven patriotic covenants as practical actions to support the Volunteer Army's resistance against America and aid to Korea.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Shuangcheng telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 10th, saying: In order to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, in addition to actively supporting the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in various practical actions against the aggression of American imperialism, we held a parade and demonstration of 1,500 people today, telling the American imperialists that we have recognized their aggressive nature. All industrial and commercial people in Shuangcheng are determined to work with the people to resolutely fight to the end for the final victory of the Chinese people's struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Qu County telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 10th, saying: American imperialism is frantically invading Korea and at the same time occupying our Taiwan and bombing our Northeast. The industrial and commercial circles in Quzhou are filled with righteous indignation and are enthusiastically launching a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. On the 10th, we held a demonstration parade of the industrial and commercial circles to resist America and aid Korea. This is in response to your call to form a more consolidated united front against imperialist aggression and to give the aggressors a severe blow.

    Dear Chairman Mao, our industrial and commercial circles have formulated patriotic covenants and are willing to contribute all our strength to support the front lines, guarantee the completion of tax collection, stabilize prices, develop national industry and commerce, and unite even more to fight to the end to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Fushun telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 11th, saying: Today, the industrial and commercial circles in Fushun held a demonstration parade of 4,000 people, telling the American imperialists that the Chinese people have stood up and are resolutely opposed to the American imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression. The industrial and commercial circles in our city are willing to unite with people from all walks of life across the country with practical actions to step up production and stabilize prices, and under your wise leadership, we will fight to the end to complete this sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Changchun telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 12th, saying: The 11,000 industrial and commercial businesses in Changchun City, in order to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, defend our country, and support the just actions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist America and aid Korea, and to crush the American imperialists' frantic and shameless acts of aggression, have launched an enthusiastic patriotic covenant signing campaign.

We will always be with the industrial and commercial businesses across the country and under your leadership, resolutely fight to the end for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

    The industrial and commercial circles in Changsha telegraphed Chairman Mao on the 15th, saying: Today, the industrial and commercial circles in Changsha are holding a victory celebration demonstration meeting to resist America and aid Korea, and are enthusiastically celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang, the temporary capital of Korea, with unparalleled excitement. Historical facts teach us that we fully recognize that the American imperialists are the mortal enemies of national industry and commerce. We are taking various practical actions to support our people's Volunteer Army aiding Korea, and have collectively established six patriotic covenants as our program of action for the future. We vow to use all our strength under your wise leadership to defend our country, stop the war of aggression, and strive to build a better new China in the future to the end.

At the same time, eight patriotic covenants were adopted to ensure greater unity, vigilance, and good production, and to work together under the leadership of the public sector, not to listen to rumors, not to engage in speculation, not to hoard, actively promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, enthusiastically pay taxes, and vigorously assist the government in new economic construction, and complete the great cause of expanding the resistance against America, aid to Korea and defending the country.
