    450,000 People in Guanzhong Attend Winter School
    [By Our Correspondent] All winter schools in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi have started, with 453,900 students, exceeding the original plan by more than 110,000. The methods used in the Guanzhong area to mobilize the masses to attend winter school generally involve members of winter school committees at all levels, as well as village cadres, Party members, Youth League members, teachers, students, people's representatives, and activists, who go everywhere to publicize and explain the benefits of attending winter school. In land reform areas, cadres of the land reform work teams also paid attention to this work. After the start of school, many areas (especially those undergoing land reform) closely integrated cultural learning with land reform, production, and current affairs propaganda. Winter school students in Yubao Village, Lintong Seventh District, Tenth Township (a land reform village), learned that concealing land was wrong during their studies. During the land investigation, they voluntarily reported more than 100 mu of concealed land. In Duoma District, Xingping County, when special agents were discovered spreading rumors among the masses, students were immediately organized to read newspapers to clarify the confusion in the masses' minds. In Taixian Village, Chengcheng County, twenty-five peasant association members were developed in the winter school women's class, and fifteen students withdrew from the Yiguandao sect.

    关中四十五万人上冬学
    【本报讯】陕西关中地区的冬学都已开学，学员达四十五万三千九百余人。超过原计划十一万多人。关中地区动员群众上冬学的办法，一般是通过各级冬学委员会委员和乡村干部、党员、团员、教员、学生、人民代表、积极分子等，到处宣传解释上冬学的好处。在土地改革地区，土改工作组干部也均注意了这一工作。开学之后，不少地区（尤其是进行土地改革地区）把文化学习与土改、生产、时事宣传密切结合起来。临潼七区十乡御宝屯村（土改村）的冬学学员，在学习中了解到瞒田是不对的之后，在查田时，自动报出了一百多亩。兴平县多马区发现特务在群众中散布谣言，立即组织学员读报，澄清了群众的混乱思想。澄城县太贤村，在冬学妇女班里发展了二十五个农会会员，并有十五个学员退出了一贯道。
