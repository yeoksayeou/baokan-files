The artists of the Beijing opera circle, beloved by the people, have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale in this movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland. They have carried out patriotic propaganda work in streets, suburbs, and theaters through various forms such as storytelling, short plays, and speeches, which have been warmly welcomed by the masses.

As early as the end of July, the opera circle spontaneously organized a propaganda team of fifty to sixty people, created various works, and conducted four days of propaganda against the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan. After the upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in November, they spontaneously organized a propaganda team of more than one hundred people, led by famous artist Lian Kuo-ru as the captain, and conducted four days of large-scale propaganda work. After the start of the film propaganda month, new storytelling programs were added to every morning show. More than eighty members of the Tianqiao Storytelling Improvement Group also went to the Ninth District to conduct propaganda for a day at the end of November. In addition, the Qianmen Jianlou Mass Entertainment Center has been performing newly compiled programs every day since the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Radio stations have also recently been broadcasting new storytelling programs. Various Beijing opera troupes mostly use "Adding an Official" and rhythmic storytelling to promote Resist America, Aid Korea. Artists in the Pingju opera circle use short speeches during the intervals of performances to carry out propaganda to the audience.

The propaganda of the opera circle has had a great educational impact on the citizens. The three propaganda teams they organized had more than 30,000 direct listeners. Countless more people have listened to their performances in theaters, entertainment centers, and radio stations. Many citizens who are illiterate and do not read newspapers have come to understand current affairs and improve their political understanding through their propaganda. The general public has expressed a warm welcome to these familiar artists and their novel propaganda methods and popular and vivid language. When their propaganda team was conducting propaganda near the Drum Tower, and Beijing opera artist Wu Suqiu was giving a speech, the audience spontaneously brought tea to comfort them. Someone even brought a thermos from home for Wu Suqiu to drink. When the Tianqiao Storytelling Improvement Group went to Dongtan'gen to conduct propaganda, this remote place, where usually not even a hundred people passed by each day, attracted more than a thousand listeners. An old man in his sixties excitedly told Luo Peilin, a lantern slide artist known as "Little Golden Tooth," "Your propaganda about Resist America, Aid Korea is really on point." When the Danxian artist Cao Baolu performed at the morning show in the Honglou Cinema, he first denounced the American imperialists' crimes of aggression, and the elementary school students in the audience were very excited. They not only followed Cao Baolu in shouting slogans, but also shouted "Down with American Imperialism" themselves. The stage and the audience were united as one. This enthusiastic mood often appeared in other cinemas as well.

Artists who hate American imperialism and love their motherland are publicizing the reasons for Resist America, Aid Korea, anytime and anywhere. When the card opera artist Yin Fulai was getting a haircut, he heard someone say that the United States and the Soviet Union were the same to China. He immediately used facts to illustrate how the American imperialists had invaded us and how the Soviet Union had helped us, making that person suddenly realize and join in cursing the American imperialists. Some storytelling artists tell this story when they perform at morning shows in cinemas. Once, when they talked about the contrast between the American imperialists and the Soviet Union, they said a sentence, and the audience in the audience excitedly followed with a loud "That's right!" Such vivid propaganda helped the audience distinguish between friends and enemies.

It is not accidental that the artists who have turned over are so enthusiastically and extensively participating in this Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work. Before liberation, they suffered all kinds of persecution from the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and personally witnessed the various crimes of the American imperialists. After liberation, they received the care and respect of the People's Government. With the help of the government, they studied in opera training classes and their thinking was transformed. Everyone had a bright future and knew how to contribute their strength to the people. Zhao Fucheng, from the Pingju opera circle, was still a vegetarian who recited Buddhist scriptures and did not ask about politics during the siege of the city by the People's Liberation Army. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he was dragged away and beaten several times by secret agents and puppet police. At that time, he heard that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army were good, but he did not believe it. However, after the People's Liberation Army entered the city last year, their strict discipline changed his skepticism. Once, he wanted to cross the street, but a cavalry of the People's Liberation Army was passing by. Just as he was hesitating, a soldier reined in his horse and said, "Old man, you go first!" He was so moved that he almost shed tears. After liberation, he was never beaten or insulted again. He began to see the difference between the Communist Party and the Chiang bandits. Later, in the two opera training classes, he not only learned culture, but also improved his political understanding and actively participated in the propaganda work of Resist America, Aid Korea.

Most of the artists who have studied in the opera circle are like this. In this Resist America, Aid Korea movement, after listening to the reports of the comrades from the Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the crimes of aggression of the American imperialists, they further recognized the insidious and brutal nature of the American imperialists and actively participated in the propaganda work of each time. Although Xi Cailian was very weak, when she went to the northern suburbs to conduct propaganda, the truck bumped for more than ten miles, and she could hardly get off the bus, but she said, "It's nothing!" and still enthusiastically performed the Yangko dance in the wind and sand with the team. Wang Yutian, an old acrobatics artist from Tianqiao, and more than thirty members of the Dazhong Entertainment Center, enthusiastically went out for four consecutive days without resting. The opera circle not only donated a lot of condolences and wrote more than one hundred letters of condolences, but also held many charity performances and donated the ticket proceeds to the brave Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The opera circle is determined to use singing to strike at the enemy. Cao Baolu, Hou Baolin, Wei Changlin, Guan Xuezeng, Sun Yukui, Xi Xiangyuan, etc., have all written and sung many new programs for Resist America, Aid Korea. When Xiao Jin Ya, who is illiterate, went out to conduct propaganda, he temporarily compiled the content of the previous speech into lyrics and sang them. In theaters and entertainment centers, whenever new programs are performed, such as Guan Xuezeng's Qinshu "Blood Debt Must Be Repaid," Yu Yunfang's Dagushu "Hehe and Pingping" (written by Du Peng), and the Xin Fengxia Troupe's performance of "Chen Yumei Visits the Grave" (written by Zhao Jian), they are particularly warmly welcomed by the audience. Now they are still continuing to compose and perform new programs. They want to use singing to expose the crimes and conspiracies of the American imperialists, and to praise the power and victory of the people.

    抗美援朝运动中的京市戏曲界
    卢念高  常愈超
    为人民大众所喜好的北京市戏曲界的艺人们，在这次抗美援朝、保家卫国运动里，空前地广泛动员起来了。他们通过曲艺、小戏、演说等多种多样的形式，在街头，在郊区，在剧院里，展开了爱国的宣传工作，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    在七月底，戏曲界就曾自动组织了五六十人的宣传队，创作了各种作品，进行了四天“反对美帝侵略台湾”的宣传。到十一月抗美援朝运动的热潮掀起后，他们又自动地组织了一百多人的宣传大队，由名艺人连阔如作队长，进行了四天大规模的宣传工作。在电影宣传月开始后，每天早场都加演新曲艺节目。天桥曲艺改进小组八十多人，在十一月底又单独地到九区宣传了一天。此外，前门箭楼大众游艺社在抗美援朝运动开始后，每天都表演新编的节目。广播电台最近也播送着新的曲艺节目。各京戏班社多利用跳加官和数板来宣传抗美援朝。评戏界艺人在演出节目的间隔时间，通过简短的演讲向听众进行宣传。
    戏曲界的宣传，对市民的教育影响很大。他们组织的三次宣传队，直接听众就有三万多人。听他们在戏院、游艺社、电台演唱的人，更不知有多少。许多不识字、不看报的市民，都由于他们的宣传而了解了时事，提高了政治认识。广大市民对于这些熟悉的艺人和他们所用的新颖的宣传方式和通俗生动的口语，表示热烈的欢迎。当他们的宣传队在鼓楼附近宣传，京剧艺人吴素秋进行演讲时，听众自动地沏茶来慰劳他们。有人甚至从家里抱个暖壶来，给吴素秋喝。天桥曲艺改进小组到东坛根宣传时，在这个原来每天不一定有一百人走过的偏僻地方，竟吸引了一千多听众。一个六十多岁的老头儿，兴奋地告诉拉洋片艺人小金牙罗沛霖说：“你们宣传的抗美援朝是真对。”单弦艺人曹宝禄在红楼影院早场演唱时，先控诉了美帝的侵略罪行，台下的小学生都非常激动。他们不只跟着曹宝禄喊口号，而且他们自己也高喊“打倒美帝国主义”。台上台下，打成一片。这种热烈的情绪，也常常在别的影院里同样地出现。
    仇恨美帝、热爱祖国的艺人们，随时随地宣传抗美援朝的道理。牌子戏艺人尹福来在理发时，听见一个人说美国和苏联对中国都一样，他马上用事实来说明美帝怎样侵略我们，苏联怎样帮助我们，使那个人恍然大悟，跟着骂起美帝来。有些曲艺界艺人在影院早场表演时，都说述这个故事。有一次，当他们讲到美帝和苏联的对比时，他们讲一句，台下听众就激昂地跟着说一声“对！”这样生动的宣传，帮助听众分清了敌友。
    翻身的艺人们这样空前热烈而广泛地参加这个抗美援朝的宣传工作，不是偶然的。他们在解放前受尽了日寇和蒋介石匪帮的迫害，亲眼见过美帝的种种罪行。解放后，他们受到人民政府的爱护和尊重。在政府的帮助下，他们在戏曲讲习班进行了学习，思想得到了改造。他们每个人都有了一个光明的前途，知道了如何为人民贡献自己的力量。评戏界的赵富成，在解放军围城期间，还是个吃斋念佛不问政治的人。在国民党反动统治时期，他几次被特务和伪警察拉去毒打。那时，他听说共产党和解放军好，还不相信。但是在去年解放军进城后，严明的军纪改变了他的怀疑态度。有一次他要横过大街，但是街上正过着解放军的马队。他正犹疑不敢走时，一个战士勒住了马，说：“老大爷，您先过去吧！”他感动得几乎落下泪来。解放后他再也没有受到过打骂和侮辱。他开始看见了共产党和蒋匪帮的不同。以后，在两次戏曲界讲习班的学习，不只使他学到了文化，而且提高了他的政治认识，积极地做抗美援朝的宣传工作。
    戏曲界经过学习的艺人，大多数都是这样。在这次抗美援朝运动里，他们听了市文艺处、市文联同志们关于美帝侵略罪行的报告，更认清了美帝的阴险残暴，积极地参加了各次的宣传工作。喜彩莲虽然身体很弱，她到北郊宣传时，大卡车颠了十几里路，她几乎连车都下不去了，可是她说：“没有什么！”仍然随着大队在风沙里热情地扭秧歌。天桥的耍叉老艺人王雨田和大众游艺社的三十几个社员，都是热情地连续出动四天，不肯休息。戏曲界不只捐献了很多慰问品，写了一百多封慰问信，而且还举行了多次的义务演出，将票款捐献给神勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。戏曲界决心用演唱来打击敌人。曹宝禄、侯宝林、魏长林、关学曾、孙玉奎、席香远等，都自己编唱了许多抗美援朝的新节目。不识字的小金牙在外出宣传时，就临时把前面讲演的内容，编成唱词唱。在戏院和游艺社里，凡是演唱新节目时，如关学曾唱的琴书“血债血还”，于韵芳唱的大鼓“和和与平平”（杜澎编），新凤霞剧团演的“陈玉梅上坟”（赵坚编），都格外地受到听众热烈欢迎。现在他们还在继续编演新节目。他们要用演唱来揭露美帝的罪行和阴谋，歌颂人民的力量和胜利。
