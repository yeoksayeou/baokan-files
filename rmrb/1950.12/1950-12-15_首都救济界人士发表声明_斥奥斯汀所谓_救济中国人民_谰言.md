    **Relief Figures in the Capital Issue Statement**
    **Denouncing Austin's Absurd Claims of "Relieving the Chinese People"**
    [Our Newspaper] Peng Zemin and 34 other figures from the relief sector and related fields in the capital have jointly issued a statement denouncing Austin's absurd claims of the United States "relieving the Chinese people." The full text of the statement is as follows:
    At the United Nations Security Council meeting on November 28, which discussed the accusation of the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan, Austin, the mouthpiece of U.S. imperialism, in order to evade the bloody facts of his aggression against China's territory of Taiwan, invasion of China's airspace and territorial waters, bombing and strafing of the Chinese people, shamelessly fabricated a record of the U.S. imperialists' "friendship" towards the Chinese people. In his shameless speech, he even emphasized so-called "relief supplies" and "economic aid." He even called the "relief" and "aid" given to the Kuomintang reactionaries as capital for slaughtering the Chinese people, as "excellent friendship" to the Chinese people, and regarded the Chinese people who suffered from imperialist exploitation as beggars who had to rely on his "relief." He said: "Millions of Chinese people will never forget that during the difficult years after the war, they were able to have food to eat, jobs, clothes to wear, and travel, mostly because of American aid." This kind of shameless, black-and-white-reversing nonsense is a great insult to the Chinese people, arousing our infinite anger and hatred.
    The so-called "relief" of the U.S. imperialists has always been one of their means of carrying out aggression against China. Under the guise of "relief" and "aid," they usurped China's sovereignty, interfered in China's internal affairs, and used it to cover up their activities of subsidizing the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries in slaughtering the Chinese people. The Chinese people have long learned from years of painful experience this kind of "friendship" and have long been deeply disgusted with it.
    Historical facts will judge the crimes and deceptions of the U.S. imperialists. Austin repeatedly stated that their "aid is of great significance," so let's see where this great significance is manifested: First of all, how the U.S. imperialists used "relief supplies" to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in carrying out the civil war. The so-called "relief flour" was mostly military grain used by the Chiang bandits, the so-called "relief cotton cloth" was mostly used by the Chiang bandits to make military uniforms, and the so-called "relief cars" and the planes of the "Chennault Air Transport Company" were powerful means of transportation for the Chiang bandits to transport military supplies and weapons. Let's look at the military conspiracy of the Chiang bandit army in 1947 to block the Huayuankou of the Yellow River and flood the liberated areas and civilians in the lower reaches. Wasn't it the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)," which claimed to be "charitable" and "relief," that drafted the plan and was responsible for carrying it out? The U.S.-controlled UNRRA, which boasted of a "non-discrimination" policy, came to China in 1946 to carry out "post-war rehabilitation" and "relief." It only gave the liberated areas, which were the most severely devastated by the Japanese寇's "Three Alls Policy" and accounted for three-fifths of the total disaster-stricken population in China, less than two percent of all materials shipped to China. Isn't this policy of less than two percent intentionally used by the U.S. imperialists to cover up the fact that 98 percent of the materials were used to assist the Chiang bandit gang in slaughtering the Chinese people? Austin argued that the U.S. imperialists' "friendly record with China is still vivid in people's minds." Yes, we cannot forget these bloody facts that poisoned the Chinese people! Let's look at how the U.S. imperialists used "relief" to infringe upon China's sovereignty. After Japan's surrender, weren't the foreign ships sailing on the Yangtze River inland waterways U.S. ships under the pretext of carrying "relief supplies"? For example, the so-called "Relief Agreement" and "Bilateral Agreement" signed by the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandits stipulated that the Chiang bandits had to submit plans for relief, "subject to review and approval by the U.S. government." The distribution of relief supplies "should be directly supervised and managed by the U.S. government." The U.S. imperialists dispatched a large number of delegations "as part of the U.S. Embassy in China," enjoying various privileges and immunities, "traveling freely throughout China," requiring the Chiang bandits to provide the U.S. imperialists with "information on China's economic situation" on time, and forcing the Chiang bandits to find ways to transfer "materials produced in China that the U.S. imperialists lacked or might lack and needed" and "make every effort to reduce obstacles to trade with the United States." After these activities were carried out, the Chiang bandits were required to "conduct full and continuous publicity on U.S. aid to China" among the Chinese people. Aren't these records of aggression "still vivid in people's minds"? Austin repeatedly boasted that the activities of the "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" in China were "mainly for the benefit of Chinese farmers," but the facts proved that the U.S. imperialists followed the old path of Japanese aggression against China, wanting "agricultural China" and "raw material China." Under the U.S. imperialists' permission to the Chiang bandits to "sell everything to exchange money to continue the civil war," the U.S.-controlled UNRRA's American cotton did not reach the people, but all fell into the "China Textile Industries Corporation" of the Song Ziwen bureaucratic capital group, intensifying the plunder of the people. It was precisely because these "relief goods" flooding the market crowded out domestic products that Chinese factories closed down and China's national industry was strangled. The U.S. imperialists never "filled the rice bowls of ten million Chinese," on the contrary, the U.S. imperialists instructed UNRRA to monopolize rice prices in the coastal areas of southern China, and obstructed overseas Chinese in Siam from transporting rice to China to relieve flood disasters, causing many people in certain southern provinces to die of starvation. All these actions, spoken by Austin, were "relief," "aid," and "friendship," but to the Chinese people, wasn't this robbery-style economic aggression?
    The U.S. imperialists did give the Kuomintang reactionaries a lot of materials "not including Lend-Lease and military aid" "for the reconstruction of war-torn areas." But these materials were all surplus materials and military materials that the U.S. imperialists could not ship back home after the war or were to be burned and dumped into the sea during the economic crisis. Most of these materials were used by Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the people, to raise a large number of Chiang family corrupt officials, secret agents, and local bullies, and to engage in sabotaging the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. The very small portion of materials left was used to buy people's hearts, distributing some "household registration noodles," sour milk, broken clothes, and shoes in some cities. Among them, some medical supplies were mostly not suitable for actual needs, and even medicines were expired, impure, and turned into deadly poisons. Austin boasted that the United States held or "funded" many orphanages and hospitals in China, but he should remember that the "United China Relief Association," the largest and most numerous relief organization "funded" by the United States in China that aided orphanages and hospitals, wrote in its fundraising appeal, "Donate one more penny, and you will add more strength to stop the development of communism." When the Kuomintang reactionary government was about to collapse completely and the U.S. imperialists had completely bankrupted themselves in the eyes of the Chinese people, U.S. reactionary Congressman Judd sang the absurd tune of "using relief to win back the hearts of the Chinese people." So this is what Austin meant by "charitable"!
    The facts are very clear. Austin is inheriting the tradition of "Hoover Relief" after World War I, all the way to Acheson's conspiracy to provide disaster relief in the first half of this year, using "relief" to slander the Chinese people. The purpose of his speech is to deceive other member states of the United Nations and the American people, alienate the unity of the Chinese people in the anti-U.S. aggression movement, and further cover up the fact that he is aggressing against Taiwan, China. The Chinese people have always been self-reliant and resolutely opposed imperialist aggression. The long history of the Chinese people's bravery and diligence proves this. For more than a year, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overcome many difficulties left by imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule and built many great undertakings. This fact further proves this. The Chinese people naturally do not reject and welcome the truly well-intentioned assistance of international friends, but that is definitely not the "aid" and "friendship" based on military, political, economic, and cultural aggression policies that Austin, Dulles, and others are doing their best to slander the Chinese people. We absolutely dare not accept this kind of "aid" and "friendship." We have learned from our own experience that this kind of "relief," "aid," and "friendship" from the U.S. imperialists means the death of millions of people and the loss of national freedom and rights. We want to expose the lies of Austin and Dulles at the United Nations meeting, and at the same time, we solemnly declare here: We unanimously and resolutely support Representative Wu Xiuquan's righteous accusation, and we will fight to the end to defeat the U.S. imperialists' aggression against the fraternal country of Korea and Taiwan, China!

    首都救济界人士发表声明
    斥奥斯汀所谓“救济中国人民”谰言
    【本报讯】首都救济界及有关人士彭泽民等三十五人联名发表声明，斥奥斯汀所谓美国“救济中国人民”的谰言。声明全文如下：
    在十一月二十八日联合国安全理事会讨论控诉美国武装侵略台湾的会议上，美帝国主义的代言人奥斯汀为了闪避其侵略中国领土台湾，侵入中国领空领海轰炸和扫射中国人民的血腥事实，竟然装模作样地假造一套美帝对中国人民的“友谊”记录，在其无耻的发言中还强调了所谓“救济物资”和“经济援助”。他竟把给予国民党反动派作为屠杀中国人民资本的“救济”和“援助”，称为对中国人民的“极佳的友谊”，把身受帝国主义剥削的中国人民当成非靠他“救济”不可的乞丐；他说：“千千万万的中国人决忘不了，在大战以后的困难岁月中，他们所以能有饭吃，有工作，有衣穿，能旅行，大部分是由于有了美国援助的缘故。”这种厚颜无耻颠倒黑白的谰言是对中国人民的莫大侮辱，引起我们无限的愤怒和仇恨。
    美帝国主义者的所谓“救济”，一贯是他们实行侵略中国的手段之一。他们假借“救济”“援助”为名，僭夺中国主权，干涉中国内政，并用以掩盖其资助中国国民党反动派屠杀中国人民的勾当。中国人民从多年的惨痛经验中早已领教过这种“友谊”，并对这种“友谊”早已深恶痛绝了。
    历史的事实会审判美帝国主义者的这种罪恶与欺诈。奥斯汀口口声声表示他们的“援助是具有很大意义”的，请看这很大意义表现在什么地方：首先是美帝如何运用了“救济物资”来援助蒋介石匪帮进行内战。所谓“救济面粉”绝大部分是给蒋匪军用的军粮，所谓“救济棉布”绝大部分是给蒋匪军做军装的，所谓“救济汽车”及“陈纳德空运公司”的飞机，这是给蒋匪军作运输军需和武器用的得力交通工具。请再看一九四七年蒋匪军堵塞黄河花园口用水淹没下游解放区军民的军事阴谋，不正是号称“慈善”“救济”的“联总”拟好计划而负责进行的吗？以“不歧视”政策所标榜的美帝控制的“联总”，在一九四六年到中国来进行“善后”和“救济”，对当时受日寇“三光政策”摧残最厉害的占全中国受灾人口五分之三的解放区人民只予以全部运华物资的百分之二弱，请问这种百分之二弱的政策岂不是美帝有意用来掩盖将百分之九十八的物资援助蒋匪帮屠杀中国人民的事实吗？奥斯汀狡辩着美帝“对中国友好的记录尚历历在人眼前”，是的，这些毒害中国人民的血腥事实我们忘记不了！请再看美帝是如何利用“救济”侵犯了中国的主权。日本投降后，在长江内河航行的外国船只，不正是借口装运“救济物资”的美国船只吗？又如美帝与蒋匪帮签订的所谓“救济协定”和“双边协定”，按照其中规定，蒋匪须提出需要救济之计划，“经美国政府之审查及核准”，救济物资之分配“美国政府应有直接监督及管理权”，美帝派遣了大批“为美国驻华大使馆的一部分”的代表团，享有各种特权与豁免，“在中国全境自由旅行”，要蒋匪按时将“关于中国经济状况之情报”提供美帝，令蒋匪设法转让凡美帝“本国资源缺乏及可能缺乏而需要之中国所产物资”并“尽一切努力来减少对美贸易的障碍”。当这些勾当进行后，又要蒋匪在中国人民间“进行关于美国援助中国的充分与继续之宣传”，难道这些侵略的纪录尚“不历历在人眼前”吗？奥斯汀一再吹嘘“美中复兴农村联合计划”在中国的活动是“主要为了中国农民的利益”，但事实所证明的是美帝沿袭着日本侵华的老路，要“农业中国”，“原料中国”。在美帝对蒋匪“变卖每一样财物，换得金钱继续内战”的允许下，美帝操纵的“联总”的美棉并未达到人民手中，反倒全部落入宋子文官僚资本集团的“中纺”公司，加紧搜刮人民。就是因为那些充斥市场的“救济品”排斥了国货，中国的工厂倒闭了，中国的民族工业被扼杀了。美帝在任何年代并未“装满了一千万中国人的饭碗”，相反的，倒是美帝指使“联总”在中国南方沿海垄断了米价，并多方阻挠暹罗华侨运米来华救济水灾，使南方某些省份许多人民死于饥馑。这一切行动，被奥斯汀讲起来是“救济”“援助”和“友谊”，但对中国人民讲起来，这不是强盗式的经济侵略吗？
    美帝的确给了国民党反动派不少“并不包括租借法案和军事援助在内”的“为复兴受战争破坏”的物资。但这些物资均是战后美帝不能运回国的或是经济危机时要焚毁和倾到海中去的剩余物资和军事物资。这些物资绝大部分用来供蒋介石屠杀人民，豢养大批蒋家贪官污吏、特务及地主恶霸分子，从事破坏中国人民的革命运动，而所余极少部分的物资用以收买人心，在某些城市散发些“户口面”，酸牛乳，破衣鞋等，其中有些医药物资，大部分不合实际需要，甚至药品时间失效，质地不纯，变成杀人的毒品。奥斯汀吹嘘着美国在华举办了或“资助”了许多孤儿院，医院，但他当记得，正是美国在华“资助”孤儿院、医院最多和最大的救济团体“美国援华联合会”，在其募捐的文告中，曾写过“多捐一文钱，也就多增加一份阻止共产主义发展的力量”。当国民党反动政府即将全面崩溃，美帝已在中国人民心目中完全破产的时候，美国反动议员周以德曾高唱着“要用救济挽回中国人心”的谰调。奥斯汀所谓的“慈善性质”，原来如此！
    事实很明显，奥斯汀又在继承第一次世界大战后“胡佛救济团”一直到今年上半年的艾奇逊阴谋救灾的传统衣钵，利用“救济”来诬蔑中国人民了。他的演说的用意也就在欺骗联合国其他会员国及美国的人民，离间中国人民在反对美帝侵略运动中的团结，进而掩盖其侵略中国台湾的事实。中国人民向来是自力更生，坚决反对帝国主义侵略的，中国人民勇敢勤劳的悠久历史证明了这点。一年多以来，中国人民在英明的毛主席领导下，克服了许多帝国主义与国民党反动统治所留下的困难，建设了许多伟大事业，这一事实也更证明了这点。中国人民自然不拒绝而且欢迎国际友人的真正善意的援助，但那绝不是奥斯汀，杜勒斯之流用以极力毁谤中国人民的，建筑在军事、政治、经济、文化侵略政策上的“援助”和“友谊”。对于这种“援助”和“友谊”我们绝对不敢领教。我们已从亲身经验中懂到美帝这种“救济”“援助”的“友谊”就是几百万人民的死亡，就是民族自由和权利的丧失。我们要揭穿奥斯汀、杜勒斯在联合国会议上的谰言，同时在这里严正地声明：我们一致坚决拥护伍修权代表义正辞严的控诉，誓必为击退美帝对朝鲜兄弟国家及中国台湾的侵略而斗争到底！彭泽民、谢觉哉、司徒美堂、伍云甫、赵朴初、舒舍予、雷洁琼、方与严、吴景超、关瑞梧、熊瑾玎、刘清扬、林仲、浦化人、胡兰生、林士笑、廖梦醒、章元善、谢邦定、管大同、倪斐君、顾锦心、朱端绶、刘绛文、沈元晖、丑子冈、于汝麒、屈元等三十五人。
