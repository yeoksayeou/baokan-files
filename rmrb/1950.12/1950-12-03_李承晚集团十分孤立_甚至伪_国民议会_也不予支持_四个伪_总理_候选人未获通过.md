Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: The Li Seung-man clique, propped up by U.S. imperialism, is extremely isolated, even within the puppet “National Assembly.” According to a United Press dispatch from Seoul on the 23rd, Li Seung-man had continuously proposed four candidates for the puppet “Prime Minister” to the puppet “National Assembly,” including Shin Sung-mo and three others. However, none of these four were approved by the puppet “National Assembly.” Furthermore, according to a broadcast from Seoul Radio, the Li Seung-man regime has been without a Prime Minister since March of this year. When Li Seung-man first nominated Paik Nak-chun as a candidate on November 3rd, the "National Assembly" rejected the approval by a large majority of one hundred votes to twenty-one votes. Some members of the assembly even attacked the Li Seung-man clique for launching the Korean civil war under the orders of Washington.

Under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, the puppet “National Assembly” approved the fifth candidate, Chang Myon, proposed by Li Seung-man on the 23rd, to serve as the puppet “Prime Minister.” Chang Myon is a favorite of U.S. imperialism, and has been Li Seung-man's "ambassador" to the United States since January 1949, but the aforementioned United Press dispatch acknowledges that this is only a "superficial reconciliation." These circumstances illustrate that Li Seung-man does not have support in Korea, and that he is only able to continue in power because of the support of the United States.

    李承晚集团十分孤立
    甚至伪“国民议会”也不予支持  四个伪“总理”候选人未获通过
    【新华社二十八日讯】美帝国主义扶植的李承晚集团，甚至在伪“国民议会”中也十分孤立。据美联社汉城二十三日讯：李承晚曾连续向伪“国民议会”提出四个伪“总理”的候选人，其中包括申性模及其他三人。但这四人均未能获得伪“国民议会”的通过。另据汉城电台广播：自从本年三月以来，李承晚政权就一直没有一个国务总理。当李承晚十一月三日第一次提名白乐天为候选人时，“国民议会”以一百票对二十一票的大多数拒绝批准。议会里还有一些议员攻击李承晚集团在华盛顿的命令下，发动朝鲜的内战。
    在美帝国主义的压力下，伪“国民议会”已于二十三日批准了李承晚提出第五个候选人张勉，出任伪“总理”。张勉是美帝国主义的宠大，自一九四九年一月以来，一直是李承晚派驻美国的“大使”，但上述美联社电讯承认这只是“表面上的和解”。这些情况说明，李承晚在朝鲜得不到支持，他所以能够继续当权，仅仅是由于美国的支持。
