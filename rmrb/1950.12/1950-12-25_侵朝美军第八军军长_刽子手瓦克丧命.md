Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Walker, Lieutenant General and commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, who was bitterly hated by the Korean people, died north of Seoul on the 23rd. News of Walker's death was strictly suppressed by the U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters. According to the Associated Press, NBC reporter Cantrell and UPI reporter Webb have been deprived of "news privileges" for "prematurely leaking" Walker's death. While announcing Walker's death, MacArthur also announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Ridgway, Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in Washington, to succeed Walker as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army. The butcher Walker was notorious for his ferocious and bloodthirsty nature. According to the captured U.S. Air Force pilot Leifschay during interrogation: "Walker, the commander of the Eighth Army, ordered us to turn Korea into a desert." During the retreat of the American bandit troops he commanded from Pyongyang this time, he ordered the burning of Pyongyang in an all-out implementation of the so-called "scorched earth policy" (Central News Agency, U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters, December 4th).

    侵朝美军第八军军长
    刽子手瓦克丧命
    【新华社二十四日讯】朝鲜人民切齿痛恨的美国侵略军第八军军长瓦克中将，已于二十三日在汉城以北丧命。瓦克丧命的消息曾为美国第八军军部严密封锁。据美联社透露，美国国家广播公司记者坎特尔和合众社记者伟勃由于“过早泄露”了瓦克的死亡已受到剥夺“新闻特权”的处分。麦克阿瑟在宣布瓦克丧命同时，已宣布任命刻在华盛顿的美国陆军副参谋长李奇微中将继瓦克为美侵略军第八军军长。刽子手瓦克以凶残的嗜杀成性而臭名远扬。据被俘的美空军驾驶员李夫柴在被审讯时供称：“第八军军长瓦克命令我们把朝鲜变成一个沙漠。”在这次他所指挥的美国匪军自平壤溃退时，他曾下令纵火烧毁平壤，全力进行所谓“焦土政策”（匪中央社美国第八军军部十二月四日电）。
