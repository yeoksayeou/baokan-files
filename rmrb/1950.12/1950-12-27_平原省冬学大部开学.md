    Pingyuan Province Winter Schools Mostly Open
    [This newspaper reports] Winter schools in most areas of Pingyuan Province have successively begun classes. Before the start of classes, various places trained voluntary teachers in a centralized manner, taking the county or district as the unit. The restoration or establishment of winter schools in various places mostly began after the voluntary teachers returned to their villages. Generally, it was achieved through village people's representative conferences or mass meetings, household visits and individual mobilization, inspection and summary of work, and Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres taking the lead, to mobilize the masses to attend school. In Qushan Village, Lin County, village cadres reviewed at a mass meeting the reasons why winter school last winter only involved playing poker, which led to gambling and the collapse of the winter school, reviewed their responsibilities, accepted the criticism of the masses, and restored the winter school.
    Judging from the development of winter schools in various places, the winter school movement in Pingyuan Province still has the following problems that need to be corrected: First, most winter schools have failed to connect with the current mass movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes, and defend the country. Although some counties and districts studied current affairs when training voluntary teachers, they did not see how this work was arranged in the deployment of people's schools and winter schools. This shows that the leading cadres in many areas still do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of all work being based on opposing the American imperialist war of aggression, building a strong national defense force, defending the security of the motherland, defending the people's liberation, and supporting the Korean People's Army and our volunteer army. Second, the specific leadership of some local leaders in winter school work is still very poor. Generally, counties and districts are only stagnant in the centralized training of voluntary teachers and general deployment. Third, the mobilization of the masses is not deep enough. Generally, it is still limited to mass meetings and individual mobilization methods. It has not been possible to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization by combining the specific ideas and immediate interests of the masses. There are even many areas where people's schools and winter schools have been squeezed out due to being busy with other work.

### 平原省冬学大部开学

    平原省冬学大部开学
    【本报讯】平原省大部地区冬学已相继开学。开学前各地以县或区为单位集训了义务教员。各地冬学的恢复或成立，大部是在义务教员回村后开始的。一般的都是通过村人代会或群众会，家庭访问个别动员，检查总结工作，党、团员、村干部带头等方式及发动群众入学。林县曲山村，村干部在群众会上检讨了去冬冬学光打扑克，以致发生赌钱，造成冬学垮台的原因，并检讨了自己的责任，接受了群众的批评，把冬学恢复起来。
    从各地冬学开展情况来看，平原省冬学运动，在目前还存有以下几个问题，需要注意纠正：一、多数冬学，未能与当前群众性的抗美援朝保家卫国运动结合起来。部分县、区在集训义务教员时，虽然学习了时事，但在布置民校、冬学中，却未看到如何布置了这一工作的。这说明不少地区的领导干部，对一切工作应从反对美帝侵略战争，建设强大的国防力量，保卫祖国安全，保卫人民翻身，支援朝鲜人民军及我志愿军的意义，认识尚不足。二、有些地区领导方面，对冬学工作的具体领导还很差。一般的县、区，只停滞在集训义务教员及一般的布置上。三、发动群众还不够深入。一般还只限于群众会、个别动员的方法。如何结合群众的具体思想和切身利益，进行深入的思想发动，还未能做到。甚至还有不少地区因忙于其他工作而将民校冬学挤掉了的现象。
