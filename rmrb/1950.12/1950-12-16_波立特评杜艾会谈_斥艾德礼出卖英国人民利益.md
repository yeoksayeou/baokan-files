Xinhua News Agency, London, December 15th: TASS reports that Pollitt exposed the attempt by the British bourgeois newspapers to portray the results of the Truman-Attlee talks as "complete agreement between the US and Britain." He pointed out in an article published in the *Daily Worker* that the British people are "very disappointed by the results of the Washington negotiations."

Pollitt wrote: "Attlee has betrayed the interests of Britain and peace on all the most important issues. He went to Washington not to conduct negotiations between two equal governments, but to receive instructions from Truman. When Attlee announced his intention to meet with Truman, the entire British people demanded that he represent Britain in Washington, reject Truman's statement made at a press conference on November 30th, insist on immediate negotiations to end the Korean War, and make it clear that Britain would not support a war against China under any circumstances, and immediately respond to the Soviet Union's call for a meeting of foreign ministers to resolve the German question."

Pollitt wrote: "Attlee agreed to Truman's forcing Britain to accept a broader military expansion plan, accelerate the rearmament of West Germany, and intensify preparations for an anti-Soviet war throughout Western Europe. He did not take any concrete steps to end the Korean War." "Saying that preparations are being made for negotiations is just deceiving the people."

Pollitt pointed out: "Attlee's trip does not herald peace in the Far East or Europe. Attlee has betrayed all the basic principles and interests of the British people. His actions should be condemned."

Pollitt concluded: "Let the British people express their opinions, let the British people immediately make the following demands: All British youth in Korea should return home immediately. Independent China should occupy its rightful seat on the Security Council. Britain should immediately begin consultations with China in order to reach a peaceful mutual understanding on all issues of common interest. Britain should declare its willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union in order to reach an agreement on the German question. Britain should reject all obligations to the United States and occupy a proper place in the world peace camp."

    波立特评杜艾会谈            
    斥艾德礼出卖英国人民利益
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：波立特揭露英国资产阶级报纸想把杜鲁门艾德礼会谈的结果描写成“美英获致完全协议”的企图。他在《工人日报》发表的文章中指出，英国人民“因华盛顿谈判的结果而非常失望”。
    波立特写道：“艾德礼在一切最重要问题上出卖了英国与和平的利益。他到华盛顿去根本不是为了进行两个平等政府间的谈判，而是去接受杜鲁门的训令。当艾德礼宣布去会晤杜鲁门的意图时，英国全体人民都要求他在华盛顿代表英国拒绝杜鲁门十一月三十日在记者招待会上发表的声明，坚持立即进行谈判以结束朝鲜战争，并表明英国在任何情况下都不支持对中国作战，而且立即响应苏联所作召开外长会议的号召以解决德国问题”。
    波立特写道：“艾德礼同意杜鲁门强迫英国接受更加广泛的扩军计划，加速进行西德整军，并加紧整个西欧反苏战争的准备。而并未采取任何具体步骤以结束朝鲜战争。”“说什么准备进行谈判，那只是欺骗人民而已。”
    波立特指出：“艾德礼此行，并非预示着远东或欧洲的和平。艾德礼背叛了英国人民的一切基本原则和利益。他的行动应该受到谴责。”
    波立特最后写道：“让英国人民发表自己的意见，让英国人民立即提出下列要求：所有在朝鲜的英国青年应该立即回家。独立的中国应该在安理会占有它应得的席位。英国应该立即和中国开始商谈，以便在一切共同利益的问题上获致和平的相互谅解。英国应该声明自己愿意与苏联谈判，以求在对德问题上达成协议。英国应该拒绝对于美国的一切义务，而在世界和平阵营中占一个适当的地位。”
