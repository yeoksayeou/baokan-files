　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th [December]: Shortage of soldiers and exhaustion of reserves are one of the fatal weaknesses of the strategy of US imperialism. US Secretary of Defense Marshall had to admit this in an article in the latest issue of "This Week" magazine. Marshall said: One of the most important lessons learned in the Korean War is the danger of lacking a trained manpower reserve. In the Korean War, the United States discovered that it did not have such a reserve. Marshall said: "You can't solve military tactical problems by pushing a button, you must have people, and they must be trained people." Marshall's words show the bankruptcy of the strategic thinking of US imperialism, which relies on the air force or other special weapons to win. Although Marshall said that this is "a mistake that must be corrected forever from now on," neither Marshall nor any other American imperialist can ever overcome this weakness.

    马歇尔承认美后备枯竭
    【新华社十九日讯】兵员不足，后备枯竭是美帝国主义的战略的致命弱点之一。美国防部长马歇尔在最近一期《这一周》杂志上著文时不得不承认这点。马歇尔说：在朝鲜事件中所得到的最重要的教训之一，就是缺乏一个有训练的人力后备的危险。在朝鲜事件中，美国即发觉它自己没有这样一种后备。马歇尔说：“你不能按一按电钮就可以把军事上的战术问题解决，你必须有人，而且必须是受过训练的人。”马歇尔的话，表明了美帝国主义的依靠空军或其他什么特种武器制胜的战略思想的破产。尽管马歇尔说这是“一个必须从此永远纠正的错误”，但是，不论马歇尔或其他任何美国帝国主义分子都永远不能克服这个弱点。
