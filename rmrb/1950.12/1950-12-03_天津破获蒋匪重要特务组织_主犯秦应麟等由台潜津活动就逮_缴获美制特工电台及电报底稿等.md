[Tianjin Daily News] According to the Tianjin Daily News: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, with the assistance of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Hebei Provincial Government Public Security Department, recently smashed the "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Directly Subordinate Tianjin Special Group," an important spy organization directly dispatched by the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang from Taiwan to Tianjin. The main and accessory offenders Qin Yinglin, Sun Yuqing, Liu Jinghui, Niu Yipei, Li Muren, Bian Shulan (female), Bian Shutang, Li Guangqin, Liang Xizeng, Niu Yihui, Niu Yihai and other eleven people were arrested. Important reactionary evidence was seized including a "CMS" American-made spy receiver, a transmitter, a receiving and transmitting registration book, four kinds of cipher books "Tian Mi", "Mei Mi", "Yu Mi", "An Mi", more than 170 telegram drafts, as well as wavelength call sign tables, radio parts, special agent identity certificates, resumes, and much more. According to the confessions of these criminals: this spy organization was directly led by the bandit Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, specializing in spying and investigating our national confidential intelligence, and seeking opportunities to carry out conspiracies and sabotage. The cracking of this case dealt a fatal blow to the vicious spy conspiracy of Chiang bandits. The main offender, Qin Yinglin, was a professional spy of the bandit "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics". Before liberation, he engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in the Beijing-Tianjin area for a long time. Before the liberation of Beijing, he accepted bandit orders and served as the leader of the Wanping Special Agent Lying-in-Wait Group in the southern suburbs of Beijing, and received radios, ciphers, etc., attempting to lie-in-wait for a long time to carry out sabotage. However, later, awed by the strength of our people's public security forces, he was unable to carry out special agent activities, so in February of last year, he hid the radio, ciphers, etc. separately, and sneaked into Taiwan. Later, he served as the captain of the "Technical Brigade," an action organization of the bandit "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics". At the end of last year, Cao Yafu, the chief of staff of the "Technical Brigade", considering that he was "familiar" with the situation in Beijing and Tianjin, discussed with the bandit Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Arrangement Group and ordered him to sneak into Tianjin to carry out reactionary activities. Qin bandit immediately drafted a so-called "Lying-in-Wait Plan," submitted it for approval, and was appointed as the lieutenant colonel leader of the "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Directly Subordinate Tianjin Special Group". Later, Chiang bandit special agent leader Mao Renfeng personally summoned him for conversation, instructing him on the essentials, and boasting that Qin bandit's actions were "the key to the success or failure of enemy rear work." After many days of preparation, Qin bandit successively equipped his cronies: "Captain" radio operator Sun bandit Yuqing, "Captain" communications officer and code translator Liu bandit Jinghui (both special agents of the bandit "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics"), obtained cipher books and activity funds of thirteen taels of gold, four thousand three hundred and twenty silver dollars, and after negotiating liaison methods, he left Taiwan at the beginning of this year, landed in Jiangyin County by boat via Dinghai, and sneaked into Tianjin on April 7 via Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other places.

	Qin bandit and others actively expanded their organization in Tianjin, and after setting up a radio station in the suburbs, they began to communicate with the Taiwan bandit gang. Until the case was solved, a total of 156 reports were made to and from Taiwan, including 100 reports from Taiwan and 56 reports from Qin bandit (in addition, there were 23 drafts to be sent that had not yet been sent). The types of telegrams included four types: "Ren" (internal personnel), "Qing" (military intelligence), "Zhi" (political intelligence), and "Jing" (economic intelligence).

	Qin bandit and others, fearing that they would be discovered by us if they lay-in-wait in one place for too long, once again sneaked into Tianjin in the first ten days of last month to look for a location and continue their activities. However, their various conspiracies and tricks ultimately could not escape the sight of our public security organs and the broad masses of the people, and were quickly detected by us, and the case was solved in one fell swoop. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau is continuing to interrogate the aforementioned criminals.

    天津破获蒋匪重要特务组织
    主犯秦应麟等由台潜津活动就逮
    缴获美制特工电台及电报底稿等
    【本报讯】据天津日报讯：天津市人民政府公安局，在北京市公安局、河北省政府公安厅协助下，日前曾一举破获国民党残余匪帮自台湾直接派遣来津之重要特务组织“保密局直属天津特别组”，捕获主从犯秦应麟、孙毓清、刘景惠、钮益培、李慕仁、卞书兰（女）、卞树棠、李光琴、梁锡增、钮益惠、钮益海等十一名，缴获重要反动罪证“ＣＭＳ”美制特工收报机，发报机各一部，收发报登记簿各一份，密码本“天密”、“美密”、“毓密”、“安密”四种，来往电报底稿共一百七十余件，以及波长呼号表、电台零件、特务身份证明书、履历表等很多。据该犯等供认：该特务组织系直属匪保密局领导，专门刺探与调查我国家机密情报，并俟机进行阴谋破坏。此案之破获，给蒋匪的毒辣特务阴谋以致命打击。主犯秦匪应麟，系匪“保密局”的职业特务，解放以前，长期在京、津一带进行反革命活动。北京解放前，接受匪命，任北京南郊宛平特务潜伏组组长，并领有电台、密码等，企图长期潜伏，进行破坏。但后来慑于我人民公安力量的强大，无法展开特务活动，乃于去年二月间将电台、密码等分别掩藏后，潜往台湾，后即充任匪“保密局”的行动组织“技术总队”中队长。去年年底，该“技术总队”参谋长曹匪亚夫，以其“熟悉”京、津情况，乃商同匪保密局布置组，令其潜津进行反动活动。秦匪当即亲拟所谓“潜伏计划书”，呈请批准，并获任命为“保密局直属天津特别组”中校组长名义以后，蒋匪特务头子毛人凤曾亲自召其谈话，指示机宜，并吹嘘秦匪此行为“敌后工作能否开展之成败关键”，秦匪经多日筹备，先后配备了党羽：“上尉”报务员孙匪毓清，“上尉”通讯员兼译电员刘匪景惠（均系匪“保密局”特务）等，领得密码本及活动经费黄金十三两，银元四千三百二十元，并洽妥联络办法后，乃于今年年初离开台湾，经定海乘船在我江阴县登陆，经上海、徐州等地，于四月七日潜抵津市。
    秦匪等在津积极扩充组织，并在城郊架起电台后，即开始与台湾匪帮通报，直至破案时止，总计前后与台湾通报达一百五十六次，计台湾来报一百次，秦匪发报五十六次（此外，尚有二十三份待发底稿尚未发出）。其电报种类包括人字（内部人事）、情字（军事情报）、治字（政治情报）、经字（经济情报）等四种。
    秦匪等以在一地潜伏过久，唯恐为我发觉，乃于上月上旬再度潜津，寻觅地点，继续活动。但其种种阴谋诡计，终难逃脱我公安机关与广大人民的视力，而为我迅速侦悉，一举破案。现津市公安局对前述各犯正继续侦讯中。
