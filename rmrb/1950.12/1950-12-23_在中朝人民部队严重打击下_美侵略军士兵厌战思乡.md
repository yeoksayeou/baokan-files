    Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Under the blows of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, the soldiers of the American aggressor army, who originally did not know why they were fighting, now "just want to go home." According to a dispatch from the Korean front by Associated Press reporter Swendin on the 14th, the American soldiers who once believed the "big shots" that they would soon win were "confused" when they were "besieged" by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They could not get real news, and "rumors and the army newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, which often does not publish bad news, are the only sources of information." They "feel very confused" and "do not know what will happen in the future."
    Swendin described the conversation between two American soldiers who fled from Huishan Town on the Yalu River to Xingnan. A soldier named Robinson: "We feel proud to be able to retreat because it's terribly cold there." When he talked about the embarrassing situation of the American aggressor army fleeing Huishan Town, he still had lingering fears: "That really scared us a bit. We guessed that someone was chasing us from behind." Another soldier named Gartner said: "Many people died in order to reach the Yalu River. To be honest, I don't see what it means. I just want to go home." Robinson said, "I want to go home too."
    American soldiers want to go home, but their fate is in the hands of the American warmongers who are obsessed with their own ideas. Therefore, Gartner said blankly: "I just don't know what the next step is." The defeated American aggressors are still unwilling to admit defeat. They continue to make ineffective struggles at the cost of sacrificing the lives of many more American soldiers. Therefore, American soldier Robinson believes that the American big shots are "afraid of losing face" and are "unwilling to retreat." He said despairingly: "It's about face. Countries all over the world are paying attention to us."
    Associated Press reporter Swendin admitted that these two American soldiers "specifically demonstrated" the "confusion of the front-line soldiers" of the US military invading Korea.

    在中朝人民部队严重打击下
    美侵略军士兵厌战思乡
    【新华社二十一日讯】在中、朝人民部队的打击下，那些原来就是不知为何而战的美国侵略军的士兵，现在“只是想回家”。据美联社记者斯文登十四日从朝鲜前线发出的电讯透露：那些曾经相信“大头子们”的话，说他们很快就能取得胜利的美国兵，在受到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的“围攻”时，他们就“糊涂起来了”。他们得不到真实的消息，“谣言和常常不登坏消息的陆军报纸《星条报》是唯一的消息来源”，他们“感到很是迷惑”，“不晓得以后会发生什么事情”。
    斯文登描述了从鸭绿江边的惠山镇逃到兴南的两个美国兵的对话。一个名叫罗宾逊的士兵：“我们能够退回来感觉很骄傲，因为那里可冷得要命。”他在说起美国侵略军逃离惠山镇的狼狈情形时，犹有余悸：“那真有点把我们吓坏了，我们猜想大概有人在后头追赶我们。”另一个名叫加特纳的士兵说：“为了要到达那鸭绿江，死了不少人。说老实话，我看不出这有多大意思，我只是想回家。”罗宾逊说：“我也想回家。”
    美国士兵想回家，但是他们的命运却操在执迷不悟的美国战贩们手里，因此，加特纳茫然地说：“就是不晓得下一步是怎么样。”而已经被打败了的美国侵略者，现在还不甘心承认失败。他们不惜再断送许多美国士兵的生命，继续进行无效的挣扎。因此，美国兵罗宾逊认为：美国大头子们“怕丢面子”，还“不愿退出去”。他绝望地说：“是面子呀，全世界的国家都在注意着我们呢。”
    美联社记者斯文登承认：从这两个美国兵身上，“具体表现”了侵朝美军“前线士兵的迷惑”。
