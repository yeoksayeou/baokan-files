    They Have a Motherland
    The opposition between the world peace camp and the aggressive war bloc is also manifested in their attitudes towards children.

    The Soviet film "They Have a Motherland!" directly exposes the insidious and vicious methods of German fascist bandits and British imperialists in maltreating and discriminating against Soviet children: In West Germany, British imperialists do not send the Soviet children taken away by the German bandits back to the Soviet Union. Instead, they treat them as orphans of unknown nationality and confine them in "orphanages" that are actually concentration camps or prisons, "educating" them in an attempt to make them forget their motherland and to serve as cannon fodder for new wars. When Soviet representatives negotiate to take them back, these special agents try every means to obstruct them. However, righteous people, such as the Latvian nanny Sida, the German driver Gould, did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to help the Soviet representatives, and finally rescued some of the children from the clutches of the devil, allowing them to return to the embrace of their motherland. We should be vigilant, as the children's mother accused at the end of the film: "Their crimes are still continuing! They want to make our children traitors, slaves, without a motherland, without a real name. They want to turn our children into cannon fodder for new wars. We cannot remain silent! We do not need war!"

    These bloody and sinful facts are enough for us to affirm: Imperialism, fascism, and aggressive war blocs are the most ferocious, brutal, and dangerous enemies of all children; only in countries where the people are in charge can children have true peaceful and happy lives and a brilliant future. For the sake of the second generation alone, for the sake of the children alone, we must resist America and aid Korea!

    他们有祖国
    世界和平阵营与侵略战争集团的对立，也表现于对待孩子们的态度上。
    苏联影片《他们有祖国！》直接的揭露了德国法西斯匪徒及英帝国主义虐待、歧视苏联的孩子们的阴狠毒辣的手段：在西德，英帝国主义不把德寇掠去的苏联孩子们送回苏联，反而把他们当做国籍不明的孤儿，关在实际上是集中营或监牢的“孤儿院”中，“教育”他们，企图使他们忘掉自己的祖国，供新战争的炮灰。当苏联代表交涉接他们回去的时候，这群特务们又千方百计的加以阻挠。然而，正义的人民，如拉脱维亚籍的保姆司达，德国籍的司机古尔德，曾不惜牺牲性命的帮助了苏联代表，终于从魔鬼的血掌中拯救出来一部分孩子们，使他们得回到祖国的怀抱。我们应该警惕，如孩子的母亲在影片末尾所控诉的：“他们的罪行还在继续着！他们想叫我们的孩子成为叛徒，成为奴隶，没有祖国、没有真名，他们想叫我们的孩子们成为新战争的炮灰。我们不能沉默！我们不需要战争！”
    这些血腥的、罪恶的事实，足够使我们肯定地说：帝国主义、法西斯、侵略战争集团是所有的孩子们最凶恶、最残暴、最危险的敌人；只有在人民当家的国度中，孩子们才有真正的和平幸福的生活与辉煌灿烂的未来。仅仅为了第二代，仅仅为了孩子们，就必须抗美援朝！
