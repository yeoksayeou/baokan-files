American Imperialism's Control Over West Germany
A Visit to the German Democratic Republic, Part Five
Wu Wentao

From spring to late summer, a film produced by "DEFA" company, entitled "Council of the Gods," was continuously screened in Berlin. This film, which the West German imperialist authorities regarded as a flood and strictly prohibited from showing, was packed with audiences every day. To see this film, tens of thousands of West Berlin residents made a special trip to East Berlin, and many even traveled from Hanover or Frankfurt to see it.

"Council of the Gods" does not depict "gods," but rather how German financial magnates, who call themselves "gods," colluded with Wall Street bank bosses to bring Hitler to power and instigated World War II. The story is based on a book written by an American named Richard Sasuly from the documents of the Nuremberg International Tribunal - "I.G. Farben." When humanity was liberated from the unprecedented holocaust of history by the Soviet Red Army, these English-speaking tycoons reunited with the German-speaking financial magnates, preparing for a third world war to invade the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The history of how the German monopoly groups, with the full approval of the American, British, and French authorities, established the Hitler regime need not be detailed here. The role played by American monopoly organizations, led by DuPont, Morgan, Rockefeller, Lamont, and other industrial giants, in investing in German heavy industry, developing military industrial potential, and establishing and expanding close ties between American and German industries is well known. Today, as in the period after World War I, foreign capital, mainly American capital, is again flowing into West Germany in large quantities. Many West German factories have been acquired by foreign capitalists. "Opel," one of Germany's largest automobile factories, already has a large amount of capital from General Motors of the United States; I.G. Farben enterprises have capital from DuPont and Mobil Oil; and the International Philips Trust has obtained the right to manufacture light bulbs and radio tubes in West Germany... Of course, the main investment target of American monopoly capitalists in West Germany is still the industry in the Ruhr region.

Based on the coal in the Ruhr region, German monopoly capital has grown. The coke refined from Ruhr coal is an indispensable part of the steel and arms industries; the by-product coal tar is also a source of raw materials for the chemical industry.

In the Potsdam Agreement, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union solemnly stipulated that Nazism must be eliminated and the German monopoly capital that brought Hitler to power must be broken up.

Germany's war industry must be dismantled to prevent it from being used as an instrument of aggression again. The situation in West Germany over the past five years is that the American and British imperialists are not dismantling military industries or preventing the manufacture of armaments, but are preventing the recovery of West Germany's peaceful economy to eliminate German competition in the world market. Tens of thousands of specialized machines have been removed from their occupied areas by the United States, Britain, and France because these machines cannot compete with their domestic industries. For example, many textile factories, soap factories, clock factories, and synthetic gasoline factories in West Germany have been dismantled. A factory belonging to the I.G. Farben Trust that could be converted into a bakelite manufacturing plant was also dismantled, but some of the trust's poison gas manufacturing plants were retained and not dismantled.

What is the situation with breaking up monopoly capital?

Under the occupation of American, British, and French imperialism, the managers of the Ruhr's coal, steel, and chemical industry monopoly organizations today are still the old tycoons. A man named Dr. Kost, who was a coal tycoon during the Hitler era, is now the director of the Ruhr Coal Management Bureau; the director of the Steel Management Bureau, Dinkelbach, is the general manager of "Vereinigte Stahlwerke," Germany's largest steel combine that strongly supported Hitler. Asking these guys to break up monopoly capital and democratize the West German economy is more difficult than asking a wolf to pull out its own teeth. In fact, the West German economy has not been decentralized, but has become more highly concentrated on a new basis. The "Schuman Plan," which was planned by U.S. military occupation chief McCloy and proposed by French Foreign Minister Schuman, is a concrete illustration of this.

The so-called Schuman Plan, simply put, is to combine Ruhr coal with German iron to form a super-trust controlled by American financial magnates. This super-trust will also encompass the coal and steel of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other satellite countries of American imperialism.

The purpose of this plan is, first of all, to prepare for an anti-Soviet war of aggression. Because the American imperialists know that the Ruhr coal and steel industry is the most important link in launching a war of aggression, as the experience of the two world wars has proved. At the same time, the purpose of this plan is also to eliminate all factors in Western capitalist countries that could compete with the United States in order to cope with the increasingly serious economic crisis. Obviously, the combination of Ruhr coal and French iron alone can monopolize the entire Western European industry. This is the reason why British imperialists have expressed "indifference" to the Schuman Plan. If the British coal and steel industry were also included, it would mean that the production, market distribution, transportation, prices, and tariffs of all Western European coal and steel (and other industries naturally included) would actually be under the command of the American bosses of this super-trust.

In fact, the "Schuman Plan" is not a new creation. Many economic experts from the German Democratic Republic told me that as early as Bismarck's time, the German bourgeoisie wanted to combine the iron of Alsace-Lorraine with the coal of the Ruhr and control it in their own hands. During World War I, the French imperialist bourgeoisie shouted so many "patriotic" slogans and sacrificed the lives of thousands upon thousands of people to defend Verdun, but in reality, it was only for the benefit of the steel capitalists. After the end of World War I, France recovered the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine and sent troops to the Ruhr in an attempt to combine the coal of the Ruhr with the iron of France and monopolize it by the French bourgeoisie. Due to the jealousy and opposition of the British and American imperialists, this plan was not realized. After the end of World War II, the German bourgeoisie became the "defeated" and French imperialism was also greatly weakened. The Wall Street bosses took out the old problem between France and Germany and combined Ruhr coal and French iron themselves in order to become its masters. McCloy, the agent of the American financial magnate Morgan Bank, was appointed as the High Commissioner of the American occupation zone in order to achieve this goal. It is not entirely accurate that this plan was named after Schuman.

The Schuman Plan obviously cannot solve the economic crisis problem of imperialism. On the contrary, it will make the economic crisis more serious. If Ruhr coal is combined with French iron, France will inevitably have to close a number of coal mines, and unemployment will increase even more. The ruling bourgeoisie in France agreed to this plan mainly due to the pressure of gold, but they also wanted to find a position as the "second-in-command" in this super-trust.

The big financial magnates of West Germany, of course, have their own plans. They are the major war criminals who brought Hitler to power and the executioners who massacred millions of peaceful residents. Under the protection of their old Wall Street acquaintances, they were able to escape punishment and maintain a considerable political and economic status. Of course, they are happy to act as pawns and share some of the profits. If American imperialism launches a war of aggression, they can play an even more important role.

"Bonn" government Premier Adenauer used to be the manager of the German National Bank and had relations with the Ruhr steel company, which was under the control of Morgan Bank. In addition to this economic connection, there is also a family connection: John Sherman Chance, the Premier of Morgan Bank, has three sisters, one of whom married the big banker McCloy (US occupation zone commissioner), one married Douglas, the recently retired US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and the other is the wife of "Premier" Adenauer! This is why Adenauer is so enthusiastic about preparing for war in West Germany for American imperialism and recruiting young people to be cannon fodder for the imperialist war of aggression.

    美帝国主义对西德的控制
    德意志民主共和国访问记之五
    吴文焘
    从春天到夏末，柏林连续上演着“德发”公司摄制的一部电影，名叫《群神会》。观众天天满座的这部影片，是被西德帝国主义当局视若洪水，严禁演出的。为了看到这部影片，成千成万的西柏林居民特地跑到东柏林来，也有很多人甚至远从汉诺威或法兰克福赶来看。
    《群神会》所表现的不是“神”，而是自称为“神”的德国财阀们如何与华尔街的银行老板们勾结着把希特勒扶上了台，策动了第二次世界大战。故事的根据是一个叫礼查·苏斯利的美国人从纽伦堡国际法庭文件中所编写的一本书——《Ｉ·Ｇ·法本公司》。人类从历史上空前的大屠杀浩劫中被苏联红军解放出来的时候，这些说英国话的大亨们又在和说德国话的财阀们会合起来，准备侵略苏联及人民民主国家的第三次世界大战了。
    德国垄断集团在美、英、法当局完全赞许之下怎样把希特勒政权建立起来的历史在这里用不着细说。以杜邦、摩根、洛克斐勒、拉蒙特及其他工业大王为首的美国垄断组织，在向德国重工业投资、发展军事工业潜能方面，在建立和扩大美德工业间密切联系方面所起的作用，是人所共知的。今天，和第一次世界大战后的时期一样，外国资本，主要是美国资本又大量投到西德来。很多西德的工厂，已为外国资本家所收购。德国最大的一个汽车厂“奥别尔”已经有了美国通用汽车厂的大量资本，Ｉ·Ｇ·法本企业有了杜邦和美孚石油公司的资本，国际菲利浦托拉斯已取得在西德制造灯泡和无线电灯泡的权利……。当然，美国垄断资本家在西德的主要投资对象，还是鲁尔区的工业。
    以鲁尔区的煤为基础，生长起了德国的垄断资本。鲁尔煤所炼的煤焦，是钢铁业、军火业所不可缺少的部分；副产的炭胶，又是化学工业取材的源泉。
    美、英、苏三国在所签订的波茨坦协定中，曾庄严地规定必须清除纳粹主义，并把曾使希特勒上台的德国垄断资本打破。
    德国的战争工业必须拆除，以防再作侵略工具。五年来的西德情况是：美英帝国主义者并不拆除军备工业或防止军备的制造，而是阻止西德和平经济的恢复，免除德国在世界市场上的竞争。成千成万的专门机器，已被美、英、法从其占领区中撤走，因为这些机器是他们国内工业无法竞争的。例如：西德的很多纺织厂、肥皂厂、造钟厂、以及人造汽油厂都被拆除了。Ｉ·Ｇ·法本托拉斯所属的一个可以改建为人造胶木的制造厂也被拆除，但这个托拉斯的若干毒气制造厂，则被保留下来，不予拆除。
    打破垄断资本的情形怎样呢？
    在美英法帝国主义占领下，今天鲁尔的煤、钢、化学工业的垄断组织的管理人，还是旧日的那些大亨们，一个名叫考斯特博士的，在希特勒时代是煤业大亨，现任鲁尔煤业管理局局长；钢铁管理局局长叫丁克尔巴赫，就是鼎力支持希特勒的德国最大钢铁康拜因“佛林尼格特炼钢厂”的总理。让这些家伙们来打破垄断资本，使西德经济民主化，要比让一只狼打掉自己的牙齿还难。实际上，西德的经济没有分散，却在新的基础上更高度地集中了，由美军占领首脑麦克洛埃所策划而由法国外长舒曼的嘴所提出的“舒曼计划”，就是具体的说明。
    所谓舒曼计划，简单地说，就是把鲁尔的煤与德国的铁结合起来，形成一个由美国财阀掌握的超级托拉斯。这个超级托拉斯还将囊括荷、比、卢以至其他美帝国主义附庸国的煤钢在内。
    这个计划的目的，首先是准备反苏的侵略战争。因为美帝国主义者知道：要发动侵略战争，鲁尔的煤钢业是一个最重要的环节，两次世界大战的经验都证明了这点。同时，这个计划的目的，还在于消除西方资本主义国家一切足以与美国竞争的因素，来应付日益严重的经济危机。很显然，单只鲁尔的煤与法国的铁的结合，就可以垄断整个西欧的工业。这就是英帝国主义者对舒曼计划表示“冷淡”的原因。如果英国的煤钢业也被包括在内，那就是说，所有西欧的煤和钢（其他工业自然也连带地包括在内）的生产、市场分配、运输、价目及关税等，都实际要受这个超级托拉斯的美国老板的指挥。
    其实，“舒曼计划”并不是什么新的创造。很多德意志民主共和国的经济专家告诉我：早在俾斯麦的时候，德国资产阶级即想把阿尔萨斯、洛伦的铁与鲁尔的煤结合起来，掌握在他们自己的手里。第一次世界大战时期，法帝国主义资产阶级喊出了多少“爱国”的口号，牺牲了千、万人的性命来保卫凡尔登，实际不过是为了钢铁资本家的利益而已。第一次大战结束后，法国收回了阿、洛两省，并曾出兵鲁尔，企图将鲁尔的煤与法国的铁结合起来，由法国资产阶级来垄断。由于英美帝国主义者的嫉忌和反对，这个计划没有实现。第二次世界大战终结后，德国资产阶级成了“战败者”，法帝国主义也十分削弱了，华尔街老板们就把法德间的老问题搬出来，自己动手把鲁尔煤和法国铁结合起来，以便自成为它的主人翁。美国财阀摩根银行的代理人麦克洛埃被任命为美占领区高级专员，就是为了实现这个目的。这个计划被加上了舒曼的名字，是并不十分合于实际的。
    舒曼计划显然不能解决帝国主义的经济危机问题。相反，它会使经济危机更严重化。如果鲁尔煤与法国铁结合起来，法国必然要有一批煤矿关闭，失业就更会增加。法国当权的资产阶级所以同意这个计划，主要是由于金元的压力，同时也未始不想在这个超级托拉斯中，找个“二掌柜”的职位。
    西德的大财阀们，当然也有自己的算盘。他们是把希特勒拥上台的大战犯，是残杀千百万和平居民的刽子手。在华尔街老相交们的庇护下，他们得以逍遥法外，并保持政治经济上的相当地位，当然乐得充当一名走卒，瓜分一些余润的。如果美帝国主义发动了侵略战争，他们就可以充当更重要的角色了。
    “波恩”政府总理阿登纳，从前作过德国国家银行的经理，和鲁尔钢铁公司发生了关系，鲁尔的钢铁公司是在摩根银行控制下的。除了这种经济上的瓜葛，还有一种裙带的关系：摩根银行的总理约翰·西尔曼·陈斯尔有三个姊妹，一个嫁了大银行家麦可劳（美占区专员），一个嫁了不久以前退职的美驻英大使道格拉斯，另一个就是阿登纳“总理”的夫人！这就是为什么阿登纳那样热心地为美帝国主义在西德整顿军备，征募青年充当帝国主义侵略战争的炮灰。
