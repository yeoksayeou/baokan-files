    Songjiang—Tractor drivers in Songjiang Forest Express Resolve to Resist America and Aid Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Hongru, Lü Xing, and ten other members of the tractor team of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau in Songjiang Province jointly sent a letter to this newspaper stating: The joint declaration of the democratic parties expresses the wishes of the vast Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. American imperialism is now following the old path of Japanese fascism, attempting to first invade Korea, then invade China, and finally dominate the world.
    We solemnly warn the war-mongers, the aggressive bloc headed by the United States, that the people of New China have stood up. The world's peace and democracy forces, headed by the Soviet Union, are incredibly powerful. If you, the US imperialists, dare to extend your aggressive dog heads into the garden of peace, democracy, and happiness, we will smash you into mud and bury you in the giant wheel of history.
    We, the drivers of forest tractors, have a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and combat capability. Currently, we have developed detailed and feasible plans to work hard to complete this winter's production tasks and strive to lay a solid foundation for forest mechanization. We also swear that when the motherland needs us, we will drive armored tractors—tanks—to defend our hometown, defend our country, and defend world peace.

    松江森林拖拉机手表示抗美援朝决心
    【本报讯】松江省伊春森林工业管理局拖拉机队张鸿儒、吕行等十二人联名致函本报称：各民主党派的联合宣言道出了中国广大人民抗美援朝保家卫国的愿望。美帝现正走着日本法西斯的老路，企图先侵略朝鲜，再侵略中国，最后霸占全世界。
    我们正告战争贩子，以美帝为首的侵略集团，新中国的人民已经站起来了，以苏联为首的世界和平民主的力量，是无比的强大，美帝你胆敢将侵略狗头伸入和平民主幸福的园地，我们决将你打成稀泥烂酱，死在历史的巨轮里。
    我们森林拖拉机的驾驶员，有着高度的爱国热情和战斗能力。目前我们已订出周密可行的计划，为完成今年冬季生产任务而努力，为森林机械化打下巩固基础而奋斗。我们并宣誓：一旦祖国需要的时候，我们一定驾驶起装甲的拖拉机——坦克来，保卫家乡，保卫祖国、保卫世界和平。
