    In order to make the patriotic movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country more concrete, and to meet the current needs of various groups to learn first-aid nursing, the Beijing Medical Alliance Nurses Association, in conjunction with the Chinese Nurses Association and the Alumni Association of the Peking Union Medical College Nursing School, has formed a battlefield first-aid training class. The purpose is not only to strengthen the ability of nursing staff in various medical units to master battlefield first-aid techniques, but also to enrich and standardize teaching materials and teachers in preparation for assisting various organized groups in the city to learn first-aid nursing. The course content includes general basic first-aid principles, and in conjunction with the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, experts are hired to lecture on the practical organization of battlefield first-aid and introduce typical experiences. The entire course consists of more than ten sessions, twice a week. The first session began on the 12th of this month. Because the content of this lecture is very practical, the number of people participating in the study is very enthusiastic, and the mood is very warm.
