The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau, in order to improve the environmental hygiene of the capital and restore the function of the original sewers, dredged and repaired six major systems of old ditches, totaling more than 160 li in length, this spring. It was also decided that in 1951, the remaining sixteen systems, totaling more than 320 li of old ditches, would be completely dredged and repaired. However, in order to avoid the emission of foul odors during warm weather dredging, which would affect the health of citizens, and to ensure that the ditch mud, which is most suitable for fertilizing fields, could be applied to the land before spring plowing, next year's dredging project has been started in mid-November of this year, ahead of schedule. Since November 16th, dredging has commenced in Longxugou, Damochang, Xiheyan, Nanxinhua Street, Xuanwumen, You'anmen, Dongzhimen, Yonghegong, Andingmen, Dingfu Street, Chaoyangmen, Chongnei Street, Dongjiaominxiang, and Gongan Street, among other places. The scope of this dredging project is larger than before, extending from Andingmen and Deshengmen in the north to Yongdingmen and You'anmen in the south, and from Chaoyangmen in the east to Guang'anmen in the west, covering almost the entire city.

Since the commencement of the winter sewer dredging project in the city, the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, in order to ensure traffic safety, has installed signs at each construction site. Red flags are used during the day, and marker lights are used at night. In areas with heavy traffic, straw ropes are set up along the construction site to prevent pedestrians from falling into the ditches. However, it has recently been discovered that the marker lights installed at the construction sites are often stolen, leading to incidents of pedestrians falling into the ditches. Citizens are urged to protect these marker lights. If it is found that a construction site lacks safety installations, please notify the following numbers: for those in the southern part of the city, please call 3-1768 at No. 3, Wax Wick Lane, Hufangqiao; for those in the eastern part of the city, please call 4-3316 at No. 9, Dongsi Santiao; for those in the northern part of the city, please call 4-3381 at No. 45, Nier Hutong, Huanghuamen, Dinei, so that inspections can be carried out and installations can be set up.

    京卫生工程局改善首都环境卫生
    提前动工掏挖旧沟
    望市民加意爱护工地安全设置
    市人民政府卫生工程局，为改善首都环境卫生，恢复原有下水道的效能，曾于今春掏修了六大系统计长一百六十多里的旧沟，并决定于一九五一年将所余十六系统共长三百二十多里的旧沟全部予以掏修。但为避免天暖掏沟时臭气散发，妨碍市民健康，并保证最宜肥田的沟泥在春耕前上地，故明年的掏挖工程已提前于今年十一月中旬开工，自十一月十六日起分别在龙须沟、打磨厂、西河沿、南新华街、宣武门、右安门、东直门、雍和宫、安定门、定阜大街、朝阳门、崇内大街、东交民巷、公安街等地开始掏挖。此次掏挖工程范围较前更大，北起安定门、德胜门、南至永定门右安门，东起朝阳门西迄广安门，工程几遍全城。
    本市冬季掏修下水道工程开始后，市卫生工程局为了保证交通安全，各开工沟段均装设了标志，白天用红旗，夜里点标灯，并在交通频繁的地区沿施工地点栏上草绳，以免行人掉入沟内，但最近有时发现工地设置的标灯常被窃走，以致发生行人掉入沟内的事件，希市民对此标灯多加保护，如发现有的工地无安全设置时，在南城者请通知虎坊桥蜡烛芯甲三号电话三·一七六八，东城者请通知东四三条九号电话四·三三一六，北城者请通知地内黄华门碾儿胡同四十五号电话四·三三八一，以便检查并设置。
