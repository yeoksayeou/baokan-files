    Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: TASS, Pyongyang, December 26th dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on December 25th that the People's Army forces liberated the city of Haeju, and surrounded and annihilated retreating enemy forces during the attack. According to preliminary investigations, a total of over 400 enemy officers and soldiers were captured in this battle, and various spoils of war were seized.
    Currently, the People's Army forces are continuing to force enemy forces to retreat on all fronts.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Due to fear of the victorious offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has fled Seoul in panic. According to British and American reporters in Seoul, Syngman Rhee, who was still declaring "will never leave Seoul" four days ago, "ordered the evacuation of Seoul and announced that the South Korean government would leave immediately" on the evening of the 24th. Thousands of large and small puppet officials of the puppet government, since the 24th, have fled south like stray dogs. The puppet National Assembly decided at a secret meeting on the 25th to flee to Busan. Seoul is now in chaos, "more than half of the main commercial areas are closed, and commerce has almost ceased."

    Syngman Rhee, in announcing the "retreat," stated that he was "accepting the advice of the American commander and reluctantly ordered the retreat." This shows that the American invading forces clustered in the Seoul-Incheon area have lost confidence in whether they can hold Seoul.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: According to the Korean Central News Agency: Soldiers and junior officers of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, who were forcibly conscripted by the American and Rhee bandit gangs, have recently been collectively surrendering to the Korean People's Army one after another. On November 17th, platoon leader Liang Zhenji of the 3rd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 6th Division of the Rhee puppet army, and squad leader Jin Zongguo, etc. of the 4th Company of the 1st Battalion of the 19th Regiment, collectively surrendered to the People's Army in the Taiping area of Ningbian County, North Pyongan Province. They were welcomed by the People's Army and the local people.

    The reporter interviewed eight of these surrendered officers and soldiers. These surrendered soldiers and junior officers were almost all forcibly conscripted by the American and Rhee bandit gangs. In the Syngman Rhee puppet army, they suffered all kinds of oppression. Although the weather was very cold, they were still shivering in thin clothes. Puppet army platoon leader Liang Zhenji painfully repented of the crimes he had committed in the past under the instigation of the American and Rhee bandit gangs, such as massacring people and arresting compatriot sisters for the Americans. After experiencing the lenient treatment of prisoners by the Korean People's Army and further recognizing the crimes of the American and Rhee bandit gangs, he indignantly said: "If I am allowed, I will join the People's Army and be determined to dedicate my life to the motherland and the people."

    Now, some surrendered former Rhee puppet army soldiers have joined the People's Army and are fighting against the American and Rhee bandit gangs.

    朝鲜人民军解放海州
    李承晚傀儡政府仓惶自汉城南逃
    伪军官兵纷纷集体向人民军投诚
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十六日电：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十二月二十五日发表战报称：人民军部队解放海州城，并在进攻中包围和消灭溃退中的敌军部队。据初步调查，在这次战斗中，共俘敌官兵四百余名，并缴获各种战利品。
    目前，人民军部队在各战线上使敌军部队继续向后退却。
    【新华社二十六日讯】由于恐惧朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的胜利攻势，李承晚傀儡政府已仓惶地自汉城逃跑。据英美记者自汉城透露，四天前还在扬言“决不离开汉城”的李承晚，已于二十四日晚“下令撤离汉城，并宣布南朝鲜政府立即离开”。伪政府的数千大小傀儡官员，自二十四日起，即如丧家之犬，纷纷向南逃命。伪国民议会已于二十五日秘密会上，决定逃至釜山。现在汉城秩序紊乱，“主要商业区已有一半以上关门，商业几乎停顿”。
    李承晚在宣布“撤退”时，声明他是“接受美国指挥官的劝告，不得已下令撤退”。这就表明，麇集在汉城仁川地区的美国侵略军对于是否能够困守汉城，已失去信心。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：被美、李匪帮强征入伍的李承晚伪军士兵及下级军官，最近陆续集体向朝鲜人民军投诚。十一月十七日，李伪军第六师七团三营的排长梁镇基及十九团一营四连的班长金宗国等，在平安北道宁边县太平地区集体向人民军投诚。他们受到人民军和当地人民的欢迎。
    记者访问了这批投诚官兵当中的八个人。这些投诚的士兵和下级军官差不多都是被美、李匪帮强征入伍的。在李承晚伪军中，他们受尽种种压迫。天气虽然十分严寒，他们还穿着单衣发抖。伪军排长梁镇基痛心地忏悔了他过去在美李匪帮指使下所犯过的屠杀人民、替美国人抓捕同胞姊妹等罪行。他在体验到朝鲜人民军对俘虏的宽待并进而认识美李匪帮的罪恶之后，即激愤地说：“假若能得到允许的话，我将要参加人民军，决心把我的生命贡献给祖国和人民。”
    现在，已有若干投诚的前李伪军士兵参加了人民军，对美李匪帮作战。
