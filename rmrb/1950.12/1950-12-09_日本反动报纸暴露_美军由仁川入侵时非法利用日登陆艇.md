Xinhua News Agency, December 8th - The fact that U.S. imperialism illegally used Japanese aggressive forces to participate in the war of aggression against Korea has been exposed again by the Japanese reactionary newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun". On September 24th, "Mainichi Shimbun" openly gathered Japanese landing craft captains Fujii Seii, Okui Shunichiro, Kato Shigeru, chief mate Terasaka Hideji, and Tomiyama Kisaburo, who had participated in the U.S. invading forces' Inchon landing operation, to hold a symposium. Fujii Seii stated at the meeting that the U.S. military liaison officer on his landing craft "expressed great gratitude" for the craft's assistance in the landing operation. Fujii also brazenly said: "I believe we have participated in the operation."

    日本反动报纸暴露
    美军由仁川入侵时非法利用日登陆艇
    【新华社八日讯】美帝国主义非法利用日本侵略势力参加侵略朝鲜的战争，又由日本反动报纸“每日新闻”所暴露。“每日新闻”社会于九月二十四日公然邀集曾参加美国侵略军仁川登陆作战的日本登陆艇艇长藤井诚意、奥井俊一郎、加藤繁作，以及大副寺坂秀次、富山喜三男等举行座谈会。藤井诚意在会上声称：他的登陆艇上的美军联络官对该艇协助登陆作战，“颇表感谢”。藤井并肆无忌惮地说：“我认为我们已参加了作战。”
