    People of All Districts in Beijing
    Indignantly Denounce the Reactionary Crimes of Yiguandao
    [From Our Newspaper] The people of all districts in Beijing have expressed their firm support for the measures to ban Yiguandao, and have accused Yiguandao of its counter-revolutionary actions and its crimes of defrauding the masses. At the People's Representatives Conference of the Third District, after discussing the issue of banning Yiguandao, the representatives understood that Yiguandao is different from Buddhism, that Yiguandao is an organization that uses superstition to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and that it is different from true religion. The representatives firmly advocated severely punishing the heads of Yiguandao. Liu Yunting and more than ten other workers from the Chinese medicine industry, construction industry, cleaning team, and cloth industry of the Fourth District have reported to the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions, declaring their withdrawal from the sect. Workers expressed great satisfaction after Zhang Zhenchuan, the "Dian Chuan Shi" (Initiator) of Longxiang Cloth Shop, was arrested. Wang Pu, a worker at Baoxingtai Paper Shop, also urged "Tan Zhu" (Altar Master) Wang Qingen to register with the government. People's representatives from all walks of life in the Fifth District explained the banning of Yiguandao to residents. Hu Shucheng, who is in her fifties, said, "I have lived for so long, and I have never seen a government handle affairs so beautifully. The closing of brothels and the arrest of Yiguandao leaders were both done in a very short period of one or two days." The Seventh District Consultative Committee convened a district and street representatives meeting for the entire district to respond to and support the measures to ban Yiguandao. At the meeting, Yiguandao followers Zhang Jingting and Li Wenjun indignantly recounted their experiences of being deceived. Zhang Jingting said, "All the money I earned in three years of learning business was swindled away by them, amounting to more than twenty bags of flour; the five-word mantra and Ouija that they told me when I joined the sect were all deceptive tricks." Both of them hoped that all followers would no longer be deceived and would quickly report the locations of the altars to the government. At the People's Representatives Conferences of the Ninth, Eleventh, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Districts, people from all walks of life denounced the crimes of Yiguandao. A police station and social education workers in the Ninth District held separate symposiums. At the symposium held at the police station, a man named Liu Futian said, "My wife joined the sect without understanding what it was about. Now that I know what Yiguandao is, I will go back and tell her to withdraw from the sect." Wang Derun said that his whole family had joined the sect, and now he would persuade his whole family to withdraw. At the People's Representatives Conference of the Eleventh District, representative Yan Qifa denounced Yiguandao for ruining his family, and Li Junbo (a woman) exposed the inside story of Yiguandao, urging the representatives to go back and properly publicize the government's policies and mobilize the deceived masses to escape from the abyss of suffering as soon as possible.
    In addition, students from the Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Xin Ying Middle School have also denounced the crimes of Yiguandao and are determined to mobilize relatives and family members who have joined the sect to withdraw.
