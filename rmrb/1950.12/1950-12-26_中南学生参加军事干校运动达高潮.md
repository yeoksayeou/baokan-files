    The patriotic movement of young students in Central and Southern China to join military cadre schools has reached a climax. According to incomplete statistics from Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Shashi, Guilin, and other cities, the number of young students who have already registered or are requesting to register has reached over 24,000. In Wuhan alone, the number has exceeded 8,000, and in Changsha, it has reached over 5,000. At Henan University, 1,051 students out of the total of 1,300 have registered, accounting for 80% of the entire student body. Yang Run and other Hui students from Hunan University, in order to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao for his love for ethnic minorities, are determined to participate. The 5,000 students who have already registered in Changsha held a grand gathering on the 18th of this month, and many mothers personally attended and spoke, encouraging their children. Zhou Siquan's mother, a student at Changsha No. 1 Middle School, encouraged him: "You must have perseverance, endurance, and be able to endure hardship and hard work, and study hard." In Guangzhou, Professor Wang Qi of Sun Yat-sen University, in addition to encouraging his two sons to join military cadre schools, recently encouraged his youngest daughter, Wang Aina, who is studying at the affiliated middle school of Sun Yat-sen University, to participate as well.
