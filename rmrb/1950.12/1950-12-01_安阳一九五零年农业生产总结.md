    Summary of Agricultural Production in Anyang, 1950
    Research Office of the Anyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    I. General Situation
    The entire area has 5,510,000 mu of cultivated land. Due to timely cultivation, increased fertilization, improved techniques, water conservancy projects, and victory over natural disasters, the yield of grain per mu increased by 1.5 dou (before the war, the average yield of millet per mu in the entire area was about 120 jin; this year, the average yield of millet per mu in the entire area was 114 jin). The entire area, excluding economic crops, harvested 37,550,000 shi, an increase of 660,000 shi of grain compared to last year. The average yield of cotton in the entire area was 30.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 4 jin compared to last year. Last year, 340,000 mu were planted with cotton, yielding 9,240,000 jin of ginned cotton; this year, 860,000 mu were planted, yielding 26,460,000 jin of ginned cotton. (In 1937, the cotton fields, lacking statistics from two districts, totaled 750,000 mu. This year, the cotton field area in the Anyang and Ye producing areas is less than before the war, while Lin, Tang, Qi, and Jun counties have exceeded the pre-war level.) The purchasing power of rural areas and expanded reproduction have generally increased.
    II. Basic Experiences in Leading Agricultural Production:
    A. Holding good meetings of representatives from all walks of life and consistently implementing production policies:
    This year, before each major seasonal production period, county or district representative meetings were held, effectively carrying out preparation and organizational work. During the spring plowing campaign, utopian agricultural socialist ideas were prevalent throughout the area. At the representative meetings, labor heroes and models who became wealthy through organized labor were rewarded, and policies for developing wealth through production were implemented by combining propaganda with examples, and resolutions were made to protect land and property rights. Public security and judicial personnel were organized to go to the countryside for inspections, mass meetings were held to deal with illegal landlords, and land disputes were mediated and land certificates were issued. This boosted production enthusiasm and created an atmosphere of "wait and see until autumn, look to next year." From summer harvest and planting to autumn harvest and planting, the masses further demanded changes in the work style of cadres, specifically solving problems in production and opening up broad avenues for production, especially cooperation, mutual assistance, and improved technology. At the representative meetings for preparing for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), democracy was promoted, leadership was examined, criticisms of rashness and generalization were made, agricultural techniques were taught, and experiences in increasing production were exchanged. Decisions were made, evaluated, and planned on the spot. State-owned cooperatives were organized to deliver on their promises at the meetings. Five counties lent out 1,164 head of livestock, 200 million yuan in loans, 4,710 pieces of agricultural implements, and nearly 30,000 jin of red and black alum on the spot, directly organizing the "Three Autumns" campaign. The masses criticized the slow issuance of land certificates and agricultural loans, unfair production quotas, and excessive leniency towards counter-revolutionaries, all of which were quickly corrected, strengthening ties with the masses and promoting the production campaign.
    B. Supporting the state-owned economy and developing cooperative supply and marketing:
    Economic committees were generally established in counties and districts to coordinate economic steps around agricultural production. The method of cooperative representative meetings was generally adopted, and production plans for each period were formulated according to the needs of 290,000 cooperative members. The contract system was used to obtain leadership and support from state-owned enterprises. This year, the state-owned enterprises issued 60 million jin of agricultural loans, mostly through cooperatives. Cooperatives widely signed contracts with labor mutual aid groups and handicraftsmen, ensuring the combination of production and sales for handicrafts and supporting sideline occupations and handicrafts. At the same time, the role of state loans was brought into play. As a result, on the basis of the masses becoming wealthy through production, the entire area purchased 3,730 waterwheels, five counties increased their livestock by 30,904 head, and 93,057 pieces of important agricultural implements such as plows and rakes. Cooperatives signed cotton purchase contracts with cotton farmers, expanding cotton fields, promoting improved varieties, and stimulating improved cultivation techniques. Cooperatives widely formulated purchase and sales contracts with various specialized companies, mines, and neighboring cooperatives, organizing material exchanges, promoting local products, purchasing necessities, and developing transportation, enriching the content of mutual assistance. In total, more than 2,500 purchase, sales, and ordering contracts were made from the specialized cooperatives to the village cooperatives throughout the year, supplying cooperative members and the masses with 18 million jin of coal, 9.73 million jin of salt, more than 12,000 bolts of foreign cloth, and 210 other kinds of production and living materials, and selling 7.05 million jin of wheat and miscellaneous grains, and 300,000 jin of mountain products. Old liberated area village cooperatives also established credit departments, developing credit lending and absorbing idle funds, and lending to private individuals to support production. In the implementation of the contract system, it is necessary to implement policies such as voluntariness and mutual benefit, prices, and specifications, strictly abide by credit, and conduct investigation and research, exchange economic intelligence, and have annual guidelines and plans, as well as foresight in the agricultural season.
    C. Developing labor mutual aid:
    This year, 35% of households and 33% of the population in the entire area, and 48% of households and 44% of the population in the old liberated areas participated in labor mutual aid. Through seasonal mutual aid, contact was made with cooperatives, and significant achievements were made in improving technology and enriching the content of mutual aid. Economic ties were established around skilled technicians, water wells, waterwheels, sideline occupations, and handicrafts, core figures were generated, and long-term mutual aid was formed. Long-term mutual aid accounted for one-third. State loans were provided to support mutual aid through cooperatives and cooperative credit departments in a planned way. Surplus labor was organized to carry out transportation and find markets for sideline and handicraft products through the contract system, and to carry out technological improvements, implementing the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit. As a result, each village had two or three long-term mutual aid groups that combined agriculture and sideline occupations, which were supported by the masses. The key lies in overcoming the leadership's laissez-faire attitude, being satisfied with small-scale flexibility and relaxing leadership; or formalism that only emphasizes form and numbers, but not the content of mutual aid. It is necessary to carry out organized education within the Party, take the lead in organizing the masses, correctly solve problems such as work points and wages under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, in order to expand production, conduct demonstrations, and constantly attract the masses to participate.
    D. Improving technology and fighting against disasters:
    The masses have established the idea of building a long-term business and are eager to improve technology. First, we must change the leadership style of cadres who "talk empty words and issue mandatory orders." More than 2,000 cadres attended technical classes to learn agricultural production knowledge. During cotton planting and summer planting, they went to the villages to conduct on-the-spot experiments, learned techniques from labor models, and taught techniques. Village technical committees were generally established, and 570 villages established small farms (i.e., leaving a ridge of land in the field for planting experiments). Lin County used field training methods to enable 130,000 women and young people to learn how to manage cotton. 158,000 households in the entire area implemented field seed selection. Under long-term plans, the government and farms established a large number of contracted farmers and signed contracts under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, covering more than 54,000 mu of seed retention land to promote improved varieties. The state also purchased S cotton seeds at appropriate prices. More than one million mu in the entire area suffered from floods, droughts, insect pests, and diseases. The masses urgently demanded technology to overcome disasters. In addition to generally implementing warm water seed soaking and distributing more than 40,000 jin of red alum and insecticides, the inherent experience of farmers was summarized and promoted. For example, the masses created more than a dozen methods for controlling rain and preventing drought, which were generally implemented in Anyang cotton fields, which suffered from three instances of rain and drought. At the same time, water conservancy was developed, wells were dug, waterwheels were lent out, canals were repaired, and water-splashing land was improved. Combining the promotion of technology with the mutual aid movement not only consolidated and developed mutual aid, but also made it easier to popularize scientific experience.
    III. Improving Leadership Level:
    A. Do a good job in preparing for the busy agricultural season; overcome the work style of only engaging in temporary rushes during busy times, there must be an annual plan, do a good job of preparing for next spring this winter, before each important season, conduct investigation and research, according to production conditions and the needs of the masses, grasp the key links for increasing production, such as expanding cotton fields, promoting improved varieties, fighting against disasters, and developing water conservancy, prepare in advance economically, technically, and ideologically, convene meetings of representatives from all walks of life, cooperative representative meetings, economic committees, train technical personnel, and conscientiously implement the production increase campaign during the agricultural season.
    B. Strengthen Party building and political building. Through training and transmission stations, Party day and Party class systems, and county and district Party congresses, leaders must consciously and systematically establish the long-term construction thinking of Party members, learn production policies, carry out three comparisons and three evaluations and discipline inspections, overcome Party members' privileges, factional coercion, and commandism, reward the style of walking the mass line, combine the convening of representative meetings, carry out united front education, strengthen political power construction, give play to the role of various departments in the production campaign, and consistently implement policies such as protecting private property, cooperative mutual aid, improving technology, bearing burdens, and maintaining public order. At the end of each campaign, conduct rectification and training through summary meetings to improve cadres.
    C. Organize production competitions, cultivate and reward models, grasp production links, combine with setting production plans, democratically formulate competition conditions, exchange experiences and learn from each other in the competition, overcome gambling-style competitions and commandist and formalist forms in the competition, after the three evaluations campaign, the mass evaluation of models produced about 2,000 production heroes and models in the entire area, heroes are produced from the masses and lead the masses, overcome the tendency to only say good things about heroes and not bad things, only praise them and not educate them, so that individual cases of winning trophies, exaggerating achievements, and forging facts occur, or treating heroes as omnipotent, simply using too much work time. Cooperatives pre-lend new agricultural implements to heroes, first demonstrate from the heroes, popularize scientific technology, and hold good county labor model meetings to spread experience.
    IV. Our shortcomings or mistakes in production
    A. There is a small-peasant ideology in production leadership, and agricultural production is carried out in isolation. Industrial development is neglected, and there is a lack of investigation, research, recovery, and development plans and steps for sideline occupations and handicrafts. At the same time, there is insufficient recognition of the importance of commerce, lack of attention to urban work, failure to lead private merchants, and failure to effectively organize state-owned and cooperative enterprises and private merchants to purchase agricultural products and local products, and systematically organize material exchanges between urban and rural areas and regions, resulting in a phenomenon of separation between production and sales.
    B. There is a bureaucratic and commandist style in production leadership, and a series of new problems have occurred in areas that have exceeded the pre-war level, and they have not been investigated and resolved in a timely manner. The experience of combining technology and cooperatives in the existing long-term mutual aid has not been promoted in a timely manner in labor mutual aid to enrich the content of mutual aid. Coercive competition and violations of the principle of equivalent value have occurred, and deviations have not been corrected quickly. There is a work style of rashness and generalization, and in expanding cotton fields, processing and fertilizing, implementing burden policies, and production competitions, there is a simple task viewpoint, and coercion and commandism occur.
    C. In the production campaign, attention is neglected to current affairs education and ideological construction, the political awareness of the Party and the masses has not been systematically improved, and the masses have not been mobilized in a timely manner to carry out the struggle against special agents and rumors, and the policy of suppression and leniency has not been correctly implemented to defend production construction.
    Conscientiously overcome the above shortcomings; carry forward the existing experience, conduct investigation and research, strengthen district and village leadership, so as to further carry out the production campaign.

    安阳一九五零年农业生产总结
    中共安阳地委研究室
    一、一般情况
    全区耕地五五一万亩，由于实行了耕作适时，加工加肥，改良技术，兴修水利，战胜灾害，每亩增产原粮一斗五（战前全区平均每亩产谷约一二○斤，今年全区平均每亩产谷一一四斤），全区除经济作物外收获三七五五万石，比去年增产原粮六六万石。棉花全区平均每亩合三○·五斤皮棉，比去年增产四斤；去年植棉三四万亩，收九二四万斤皮棉，今年八六万亩，收皮棉二六四六万斤。（一九三七年棉田，缺两个区统计，共七五万亩，今年安邺产棉区棉田面积不到战前，林汤淇浚超过战前）农村购买力与扩大再生产普遍提高。
    二、领导农业生产的基本经验：
    甲、开好各界代表会，经常贯彻生产政策：
    今年每个大的季节生产之前，皆召开了县或区的代表会，有力的进行了准备与组织工作。春耕运动时，全区空想的农业社会主义思想普遍存在，代表会上奖励组织起来劳动致富的英模，宣传与实例结合贯彻生产发家政策，作出保障地权财权的决议。并组织公安司法下乡巡视检查，召开群众大会征办违法地主，调解土地纠纷填发土地证。鼓舞了生产情绪，树立了“秋后瞧，看来年”空气。夏收夏种到秋收秋种，群众进而要求改变干部作风，具体的解决生产中问题，开辟广宽的生产门路，特别是合作互助改良技术。在进行三秋准备的代表会上发扬民主，检查领导，批评了突击式与一般化，传授农业技术，交流增产经验，随比随评随计划，国营合作有准备的在会上组织兑现，五个县当场贷下一一六四头牲口，二亿元贷款，四七一○件农具，近三万斤红黑矾，直接组织了三秋运动。群众批评填发土地证和发放农贷太慢，负担产量不公，对反革命宽大无边，皆迅速进行纠正，密切了群众联系，推动了生产运动。
    乙、国营经济扶植，开展合作供销：
    县区普遍建立了经济委员会，围绕农业生产，统一经济步调，普遍采用合作代表会方式，根据二十九万社员的需要，制定每个时期的生产计划，运用合同制形式，取得国营的领导与支持，国营今年发放了六千万斤农贷，大部通过合作社，合作社广泛的与劳动互助组、手工业者订定合同，保证了手工业的产销结合，扶植了副业和手工业，同时发挥了国家贷款的作用，因而在群众生产发家的基础上，全区购买了三千七百三十辆水车，五个县增加了三万零九百零四头牲口，九三○五七件犁耧耙等重要农具，合作社与棉农预订购棉合同，扩大了棉田，推广了优良品种，刺激了改良耕作技术。合作社与各专业公司、矿厂、友邻社广泛制定购销合同，组织物资交流，推销土产，购回必需品，开展了运输，丰富了互助内容。总计全年从专社到村社定了二千五百件以上代购代销收购订购合同，供给社员和群众一千八百万斤煤，九百七十三万斤盐，一万二千多匹洋布及其他二百一十种生产生活资料，推销七○五万斤麦子和杂粮，三十万斤山货。老区村社并建立信用部，开展信用借贷吸收游资，贷放私人扶植生产。在执行合同制中必需贯彻自愿两利、价格、规格等政策，严格遵守信用，并需进行调查研究，互通经济情报，根据情况有全年的方针计划，以及农业季节的预见性。
    丙、发展劳动互助：
    今年全区百分之三五户数，百分之三三人数，老区百分之四八户数，百分之四四人数参加劳动互助，经过季节互助，与合作社取得联系，提高技术有显著成绩，丰富了互助内容，便围绕技术能手或水井、水车，副业手工业建立了经济连系，产生了核心人物，形成长期互助。长期互助占三分之一。国家贷款，通过合作社，以及合作社信用部，有计划的扶植互助。通过合同制组织剩余劳力进行运输与副业手工业产品寻找销路，并进行改良技术，贯彻自愿两利政策，因而每村皆有二三个农副结合的长期互助组，为群众所拥护。关键在于克服领导的自流，满足于小型灵活而放松领导；或者只重形式、数目，不重互助内容的形式主义。在党内贯彻组织起来教育，带头组织群众，在自愿两利下正确的解决记工工资等问题，以扩大增产，进行示范，经常吸引群众参加。
    丁、提高技术，向灾害斗争：
    群众兴家立业长期建设思想树立，迫切要求提高技术，首先改变干部的“说空话，强迫命令”的领导作风，二千余干部上技术课，学习农业生产知识，在植棉与夏种时，到村当场试验，向劳模学习技术，传授技术，普遍建立村技术委员会，并有五七○个村设立小农场（即在地头留出一畦之地作种植试验）。林县运用田间训练方式，使十三万妇女和青年学会了管理棉花，全区一五八○○○户实行了田间选种，在长期计划下政府和农场大量建立特约农户，在自愿两利下订立合同，共五四○○○余亩留种地，推广优良品种。国家并以适当价格，收购斯字棉种。全区百万余亩遭受水旱虫疸，群众迫切要求战胜灾害的技术，除普遍实行温汤浸种，发放四万余斤红矾和杀虫药剂外，并总结与推广农民固有经验。如群众创造治雨防旱办法即有十几种，安阳棉田普遍发生三次雨、旱，皆发动群众治下。同时发展水利，打井、贷水车、修渠、改溅水地。推广技术与互助运动相结合，既巩固与发展了互助，又易普及科学经验。
    三、提高领导水平：
    甲、做好农忙季节的准备工作；克服只到忙时临时突击的作风，必须有全年的计划，今冬做好明春的准备，在每个重要季节之前，进行调查研究，根据生产条件与群众需要，抓住关键性的增产环节，如扩大棉田，推广优良品种，战胜灾害，发展水利，预先从经济上、技术上、思想上进行准备，召开各界代表会，合作代表会，经济委员会，训练技术人员，认真贯彻组织农时季节的增产运动。
    乙、加强建党建政工作，通过训练与传授站，党日党课制度，县区党代会，领导上要自觉地有计划地树立党员的长期建设思想，学习生产政策，开展三比三评与纪律检查，克服党员的特权宗派强迫命令主义，奖励走群众路线的作风，结合召开代表会，进行统战教育，加强政权建设，发挥各部门在生产运动中的作用，经常贯彻保障私有、合作互助、改良技术、负担和治安等政策，每个运动结束，通过总结会议，进行整训，提高干部。
    丙、组织生产竞赛，培养与奖励模范，抓住生产环节，结合定生产计划，民主制定竞赛条件，竞赛中互相传授经验，互相学习，克服赌博式的竞赛和竞赛中的命令主义形式主义，经过三评运动，群众性的评选模范全区约产生生产英雄和模范二千人，英雄从群众中产生而又带领群众，克服对英雄只说好，不说坏，只表扬，不教育，以致个别发生夺锦标夸大成绩伪造事实的偏向，或者把英雄当作万能，单纯使用误工太多的现象。合作计预先贷给英雄新式农具先从英雄示范，普及科学技术，并开好县劳模会议传播经验。
    四、生产中我们的缺点或错误
    甲、生产领导中存在着小农思想，孤立的进行农业生产。忽视工业，对副业手工业缺乏调查研究和恢复发展的计划与步骤。同时对商业的重要性认识不足，不重视城镇工作，不领导私商，未切实的组织国营与合作社以及私商，收购农产品和土产品，系统的组织城乡和地区间的物资交流，形成产销脱节现象。
    乙、生产领导上存在着官僚主义与命令主义作风，已超过战前水平的地区发生一系列新的问题，未及时调查和解决。劳动互助未及时推广已有的长期互助中与技术与合作社相结合的经验，来丰富互助内容。强迫竞赛及违犯等价政策，发生偏向未迅速纠正。存在着突击式与一般化的工作作风，在扩大棉田加工加肥执行负担政策和生产竞赛中，存在单纯任务观点，发生强迫命令。
    丙、在生产运动中，忽视时事教育与思想建设，没有系统的提高党与群众的政治觉悟，并及时发动群众进行反特务反谣言的斗争，正确的执行镇压与宽大政策，保卫生产建设。
    认真克服以上缺点；发扬已有经验，进行调查研究，加强区村领导，以使生产运动进一步开展。
