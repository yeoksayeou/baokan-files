    Year-End Final Accounts
    People's Bank Closes for Three Days
    The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, due to year-end final accounts, all its professional departments, offices, sub-offices, and savings offices will be closed to the public for three days from December 31st of this month to January 2nd, 1951. In consideration of the interests of fixed-term depositors, the bank has decided that all fixed-term savings deposits due within these three days from December 31st to January 2nd next year can be withdrawn in advance on December 30th, and the interest will be calculated based on the actual number of days deposited at the original interest rate. If withdrawals are made after the bank resumes operations, interest will be compensated for the number of days the bank was closed to the public. However, no interest will be compensated for any delay in withdrawal that is not due to the closure of the bank.
