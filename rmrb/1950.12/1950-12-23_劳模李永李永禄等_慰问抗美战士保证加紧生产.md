Labor Models Li Yong, Li Yonglu, etc.
    Send Condolences to Resist-America Warriors, Pledge to Step Up Production
    [By our newspaper] The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, headed by Li Yong, a national railway labor model, the national railway labor model Li Yonglu who attended the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and Luo Jiaxiong, a labor model from Mizhi County, Northern Shaanxi, and 19 others, wrote letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army to express their respect and warm greetings and support.
    The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew said in their letter to the Korean People's Army with intimacy and firmness: "We Chinese people and Korean people are like brothers. The American aggressors dare to commit such a shameless act, which has angered the Chinese people. We are not afraid of imperialist threats, and we are determined to stand with the Korean people and fight side by side to defeat the aggressors. Our working class is determined to support you on the production front! The final victory must belong to us!" In their letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers, they pledged: "You are fighting the enemy on the front line, and we are actively producing at our production posts, ensuring the rapid and safe completion of transportation tasks. If you need us on the front line, we are determined to fight alongside you to support you in quickly defeating the American aggressor army and winning the final victory soon!"
    The letter from national railway labor model Li Yonglu wrote: "You are bravely fighting the enemy in the freezing cold, annihilating many American aggressor troops and liberating Pyongyang. Dozens of thousands of people in various units, factories, and schools in Beijing paraded to celebrate your victory. Our railway workers have also launched a great production competition. Groups and individuals have set guarantee conditions for completing tasks and are competing with each other; and put forward the slogan 'Eliminating one accident is eliminating one American soldier.' More than 17,000 employees of our Beijing Railway Bureau victoriously completed the annual task on December 9. In the future, we will work harder to complete the winter transport task ahead of schedule to celebrate your greater victory!"
    The letter from the 22 labor models of Mizhi County was written after they heard the news of the great victory in Korea at the county's labor model conference. The letter stated: "In addition to excitement and joy, each labor model is willing to do a good job in winter production, and has formulated the 1951 production plan, and initiated a competition with each other. We are determined to go back to publicize to the masses, expose the crimes of American imperialism, enhance everyone's enthusiasm for resisting the United States, and lead them to organize, actively produce, heighten vigilance, expose hidden enemy agents, and maintain social security. We wish you and the Korean People's Army unity, courageous advance, invincibility, and strive to completely eliminate American imperialism and defend world peace!"

    【本报讯】以全国铁路劳模李永为首的丰台机务段“毛泽东号”机车组组员十一人、出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的全国铁路劳动模范李永禄及陕北米脂县劳动模范罗加雄等二十二人，分别写信给中国人民抗美援朝志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬，并表示热情的慰问与支援。
    “毛泽东号”机车组在给朝鲜人民军的信中亲切而坚定地说：“我们中国人民与朝鲜人民本是手足兄弟一样，美国侵略者胆敢作出这种无耻的行动，已经激怒了中国人民。我们决不怕帝国主义的恐吓，坚决要和朝鲜人民站在一起，并肩打垮侵略者。我们工人阶级决在生产战线上支援你们！最后胜利一定是属于我们的！”在给中国人民志愿军的信中保证：“你们在火线上杀敌，我们在生产岗位上积极生产，保证迅速、安全地完成运输任务。如果火线上需要我们的时候，决计和你们并肩一齐作战，支援你们迅速地打垮美国侵略军，早日赢得最后胜利！”
    全国铁路劳模李永禄的信中写道：“你们在冰天雪地里英勇地杀敌，歼灭了许多美国侵略军，解放了平壤，北京各单位，工厂、学校，几十万人游行祝贺你们的胜利。我们铁路工人也展开了生产大竞赛。小组与小组，个人与个人之间，都定出了完成任务的保证条件，互相竞赛；并提出‘消灭一次事故，就是消灭一个美国兵’的口号。我们北京分局一万七千多职工，在十二月九日胜利完成了全年的任务。今后，我们还要加倍努力，提前完成冬运任务，来祝贺你们更大的胜利！”
    米脂县二十二位劳模的信，是他们在该县劳模大会上听到朝鲜大捷消息后写的。信中表示：“我们除兴奋与欢喜之外，每个劳模愿将冬季生产搞好，并订出了一九五一年的生产计划，彼此发起竞赛。决心回去向广大群众进行宣传，揭发美帝的罪行，提高大家的抗美热情，并领导他们组织起来，积极生产，提高警惕，揭破谣言，消除暗藏的敌特，维持社会的安全。祝你们和朝鲜人民军团结一致，勇猛前进，战无不胜，攻无不克，为彻底消灭美帝，保卫世界持久和平而奋斗到底！”
