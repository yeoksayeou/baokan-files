    Eliminating Private Merchants' Depressed Purchase Prices and Protecting the Interests of Cotton Farmers:
    Gaoyang Cotton Farmers Welcome Credit Purchase Methods

    [Our Newspaper] To prevent private merchants from suppressing cotton purchase prices in the market and to protect the interests of cotton farmers, the Gaoyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has adopted a credit purchase method to acquire cotton from farmers. This has been welcomed by the cotton farmers, and the number of farmers selling cotton on credit has been increasing daily.

    Recently, due to the tightening of currency and the policy of subordinating purchases to stabilizing prices, some regions have suspended the purchase of ginned cotton. Some private merchants took the opportunity to depress purchase prices, creating a gap between market prices. The Gaoyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company then adopted methods such as credit purchases, exchange purchases, and cash purchases, proceeding with acquisitions based on different market conditions. From November 23rd to December 1st, in nine days, they acquired 94,938 jin of seed cotton. Among these, those through exchange purchases accounted for 31% of the total, credit purchases accounted for 40.8%, and cash purchases accounted for 28.2%.

    In carrying out credit purchases, the company first printed and distributed advertisements and notices in accordance with the credit purchase methods formulated by higher authorities, posting them in villages and larger market towns, and implementing them downward with the assistance of the government.

    In the market, loudspeakers were used to explain to the masses in an accounting manner that credit purchases not only increase prices according to preferential methods but also follow the price increases and not the decreases. Furthermore, it eliminates the accidental losses of storing cotton at home due to insects and rats. It also allows for the voluntary option of requesting payment in cash or in kind upon maturity or extending the credit purchase period. And it allows for the extraction of goods in one lump sum or in installments according to needs, so that cotton farmers can rest assured to sell cotton to the state on credit. In order to take care of the urgent needs of cotton farmers, the company also stipulated that all cotton farmers selling on credit can, according to the actual situation, sell a portion on credit and receive a portion in cash to solve daily life problems.

    After the implementation of this method, the majority of the masses responded very well. They all said, "The public sector really knows how to think of ways to make farmers happy."

    In order to improve the credibility of state-owned companies, in addition to matching cash with credit purchases, for those whose credit purchases are due, the company completely respects the wishes of the masses and pays in kind or in cash. And payments are made upon arrival, which makes cotton farmers trust the credit purchase method even more. Therefore, now, regardless of market days or ordinary days, the number of cotton farmers selling on credit is increasing daily.

    免除私商压价收购维护棉农利益  
    高阳棉农欢迎赊购办法
    【本报讯】高阳花纱布公司为免除私商在市场压价收购棉花，以维护棉农利益，采用了赊购办法，向棉农收购存棉，受到棉农欢迎，日来赊售棉花之棉农日见增多。
    近来正是紧缩货币，收购服从稳定物价，因而部分地区停收皮棉，一些私商即乘机压价收购，造成了市牌价脱节的现象。高阳花纱布公司遂以赊购、换购、现购等办法，按市场不同情况分别进行收购，自十一月二十三日开始到十二月一日九天中即收进籽棉九四、九三八斤，其中通过换购者占总数的百分之三十一，赊购者占总数的百分之四十点八，现款购者占总数的百分之二十八点二。
    在进行赊购中，该公司首先按照上级制定的赊购办法，印发了广告及通知书，分贴于乡村与较大集镇，结合政府的协助向下贯彻。
    在市场上又利用广播筒，以算账的方式，向群众说明赊购后不但能按优待办法增价，还听涨不听落，且可以免去自己保存棉花虫吃鼠咬的意外损失，以及到期根据自愿要款要实物或延长赊购期限，且能根据需要，一期提取或分期提取等好处，使棉农放心把棉花赊给国家。又为照顾棉农急需，该公司还规定，凡赊售棉农，根据实际情况，可赊售一部、取款一部，以解决日常生活问题。
    此种办法经实行以后，大部群众反映很好。他们都说：“还是公家真能想办法叫农民乐意。”
    该公司为提高国营公司信誉，除以现款配合赊购外，有到期者，完全根据群众自愿，付给实物或现款，并在支取时人到即付，使棉农对赊购办法更加信任。故现在不分集日闲日，赊售棉农日见增多。
