    Communist Party Members in Enterprises Must Strive to Learn Business Management
    Shang Kai
    The primary task of Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises is to guarantee and supervise production. Therefore, it requires all Party members in the organization to understand various issues in production operations. Only in this way can the Party's political work be closely integrated with the struggle for production, motivating all Party members and workers to develop their political and production enthusiasm, constantly improving production technology and business management, and completing and overfulfilling national tasks in a timely manner. It also requires discovering and grasping the problems that arise in the production movement. For example, timely exposing the shortcomings and errors in production leadership, and using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to fight against these shortcomings and errors.
    In the young Party organizations of Chinese industrial and mining enterprises, there are a large number of political workers from local areas and the military. These workers have mostly experienced long periods of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, and are rich in political and military struggle experience. However, on the other hand, these people almost completely do not understand political work in economic construction. Therefore, they encounter many difficult problems.
    Of course, there are still ways, that is, to study, that is, for everyone to learn various production operations skills in a planned and step-by-step manner. Comrade Wang Zimian, the Secretary of the General Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant, learned the skills of managing production in this way and successfully completed the task of guaranteeing and supervising production.
    Initially, Comrade Wang Zimian was also unfamiliar with machines and the production process. This son of a poor peasant family had only attended school for two or three years, knew very few characters, and had no scientific knowledge. Later, he joined the Anti-Japanese troops and was busy fighting. After transferring to work in the local area, he still had no opportunity to study. However, Comrade Wang Zimian believed that he could learn these skills. Therefore, he worked hard to study Soviet knowledge on industrial management and the experience of enterprise publicity and mobilization; at the same time, he went deep into the workshops to learn from workers and engineers. Once, in order to understand the calorific value of coal, he not only consulted with workers and technicians in the factory, but also personally went to the Mentougou Coal Mine to study. As a result, he was able to discover the problem of coal consumption. The coal needed for each kilowatt-hour of electricity was 0.85 kilograms, accounting for 40 to 60 percent of the cost. This was too high. He suggested to the administration and, together with the trade union, veteran workers, and technicians, studied ways to improve and put forward the slogan "Strive to reduce coal consumption to 0.78 kilograms per kilowatt-hour." As a result, by the end of June, coal consumption had been reduced to 0.767 kilograms per kilowatt-hour.
    Comrade Wang Zimian knows that as a Party committee secretary, he must not only work hard to learn production operations, but also pay close attention to the opinions of workers. The opinions of workers are the ability to improve factory production. Problems such as machine oil leaks and steam leaks, which had not been paid attention to and which workers had been reflecting on for a long time, were only seriously convened by Wang Zimian to research and study with veteran workers after he came to the factory. He further studied the problems of water leakage, coal leakage, air leakage, electricity leakage, and rainwater leakage in the machine room. After researching with the administration, he put forward the slogan "Eliminate Seven Leaks." The entire factory immediately launched a major overhaul campaign. This ensured safe power generation and created a new record of no power outages for sixty-one days.
    Comrade Wang Zimian understands that to complete the production task, it is also necessary to unite all employees. Therefore, he demands this of every Party member in the branch. Communist Party member Yuan Mingyan produced as much as 50 percent of defective products before April. But he neither reviewed nor corrected it. Therefore, the General Branch conducted severe criticism of him. And helped Yuan Mingyan correct his mistakes, so that the defective product rate quickly dropped to below 1 percent.
    The General Branch also constantly suggested that the administration promote a large number of outstanding workers to become cadres, laying a solid foundation for managing the people's enterprises.
    However, there is also another phenomenon in the Party organizations of industrial and mining enterprises. That is, not paying attention to, and even intentionally, not learning production skills, and shouting the slogan of "guaranteeing and supervising production" in vain. Comrade Yu Qi, the Secretary of the General Branch of the Beijing Machine Factory, is a typical example. According to his higher level of education, he has the conditions to learn production operations. But he neither studies advanced enterprise management experience nor goes to the workshop to learn from workers. Therefore, he still cannot explain the ordinary principle of a machine and the specifications and performance of a product. He is not even very clear about what each department produces and how much it produces. Therefore, if these comrades are asked to guarantee and supervise production, then they can only shout in vain, "We must guarantee and supervise production" and "Strive for the realization of the production plan," and cannot actually make specific guarantees and supervision of production.
    It is said that the reason why these comrades do not study is mainly that "busy work tasks take up all their time, and they have no energy to study production operations." Perhaps so. But these comrades should examine their work. Are they busy for production? Are they busy for empty slogans? Are they busy for other work? If they are busy putting forward empty slogans, then it is not necessary. If they are busy simply doing Party work, then they are wrong. The Party's work in any enterprise cannot be separated from production. Let's talk about the cadre issue! Based on what conditions should the merits of a cadre be evaluated? It is mainly determined from the cadre's attitude and achievements in production. Any discussion of the merits of cadres that deviates from their attitude and achievements in production will be out of touch with reality.
    Therefore, we must promote the former and oppose the latter. Communist Party members shoulder the great task of leading economic construction. In order to fulfill 100 percent of the task, or even exceed it, they must work hard to learn various knowledge and skills in economic construction. We believe that as long as everyone works hard to study, they will definitely be able to learn economic construction work just like they learned war and land reform in the past. Lenin said: "If all Communist Party members and responsible staff understand and realize that since they don't know, they must learn from scratch, then we will win, - in my opinion, this is the main and fundamental conclusion."

    企业中的共产党员必须努力学习企业管理
    商恺
    工矿企业党组织的首要任务是保证与监督生产。因此它就要求所有党组织的党员，必须通晓生产业务上的各种问题。这样才有可能地把党的政治工作和生产斗争密切结合起来，鼓动全体党员和职工发扬自己的政治积极性和生产积极性。不断地改进生产技术和业务管理，及时地完成和超额完成国家的任务。发现与掌握生产运动中的所发生的问题。例如及时揭发生产领导上的缺点和错误，并使用批评与自我批评武器，和这些缺点，错误进行斗争。
    在年青的中国工矿企业的党组织中，有大批来自地方和部队的政治工作人员。这些工作人员大都经过长期的抗日和解放战争，富有政治和军事斗争的经验。但另一方面这些人几乎是完全不懂得经济建设中的政治工作。因而遇到的困难问题很多。
    当然，办法还是有的，就是学习，就是大家有计划有步骤地学会生产业务上的各种本领。石景山发电厂的总支书记王自勉同志就是这样学会了管理生产的本领，很好地完成了对生产的保证与监督的任务。
    起初王自勉同志也是不熟悉机器、生产过程的。这个出身于贫农家庭的儿子，念过两三年书，识字很少，更无科学常识。以后参加抗日部队，又忙着打仗。转到地方上工作后，仍无学习机会。但是王自勉同志相信自己是可以学会这些本领的。所以他努力地学习苏联有关工业管理的知识和企业宣传鼓动工作的经验；同时他深入车间向工人和工程师学习。他有一次为了了解煤的含热量，不仅请教于厂内的工人、技术人员，并且亲自跑到门头沟煤矿去学习。因而他能够发现了煤耗问题，每度电需煤○·八五公斤，占成本的百分之四十到六十。这是太高了。他便向行政建议，并和工会、老年工人、技术人员等，研究改进的办法，提出了“为降低煤耗至每度电○·七八公斤而斗争”的口号。结果，在六月底就使煤耗降低到每度○·七六七公斤。
    王自勉同志知道：作为一个党委书记，不仅要努力学习生产业务，并且要十分地注意工人的意见。工人的意见，就是改进工厂生产的能力。一直没有人注意过的，工人已经反映很久的：机器漏油漏汽等问题，直等王自勉来到工厂后才被他郑重其事地召集老年工人座谈研究。并进一步研究了漏水、漏煤、漏风、漏电、机器房漏雨等问题。和行政上研究后，便提出了“消灭七漏”的口号。全厂立即展开了大检修运动。因而保证了安全发电，创造了六十一天未发生停电事故的新纪录。
    王自勉同志懂得要完成生产任务，还须团结全体职工。因此对支部中每一个党员都这样地要求着。共产党员袁明衍，在四月份以前，所产废品竟达到百分之五十。但他既不检讨又不改正。因此总支对他进行了严厉的批评。并帮助袁明衍改正错误，使废品迅速降低到百分之一以下。
    总支并不断的建议行政提拔了大批优秀工人当干部，为管理人民的企业，打下了巩固的基础。
    但是在工矿企业的党组织中，也存在着另一种现象。这就是不注意，甚至是有意地，不去学习生产本领，空喊着“保证与监督生产”的口号。北京机器厂总支书记于琦同志，就是个典型。按照他较高的文化水平来说，是具备了学习生产业务的条件的。但是他既不研究先进的企业管理经验，又不去车间向工人学习。因而至今还不能讲出一部机器的普通原理、和一件制品的规格、性能。甚至对各部门生产什么，生产多少，也不很清楚。因此如果要求这些同志对生产进行保证与监督时，那他们只能空喊“我们要保证与监督生产”，“为生产计划的实现而奋斗。”而不能实际地作出对生产的具体保证与监督工作。
    据说这些同志不学习的道理，主要是“工作任务繁忙，占去了自己的全部时间，已无力再去学习生产业务。”可能是的。但这些同志应当检查一下自己的工作。是为生产忙？是为空洞的口号忙？是为其他工作忙？如果忙着提空洞的口号，那就不必要。如果为了单纯的作党务工作忙，那就错了。任何企业的党的工作，都不能离开生产。就说干部问题吧！根据什么条件来评定一个干部的优劣呢？主要是从这个干部对生产的态度与成绩来确定。任何离开对生产的态度与成绩来谈论干部的好坏，是会不切合实际情况的。
    因此，我们要提倡前者，反对后者。共产党员是担负着领导经济建设的巨大任务的，为了百分之百，甚至超过任务，就必须努力学习经济建设中的各种知识与本领。我们相信，只要大家努力学习，一定是可以像过去学习战争和土改一样的学会经济建设工作。列宁这样说过：“如果全体共产党员，负责工作人员，都明白了解到：自己既然不会，就得从头学习，那时我们便会获得胜利，——据我的意见，这才是主要的，根本的结论。”
