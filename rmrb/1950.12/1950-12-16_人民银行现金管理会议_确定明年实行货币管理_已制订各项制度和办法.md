    人民银行现金管理会议            
    确定明年实行货币管理     
    已制订各项制度和办法
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民银行总行曾于十月十日至二十七日在北京召开全国第一届现金管理会议。出席会议的有全国各行处负责现金管理工作的干部及各有关部门的代表共一百五十七人。会议总结了实施现金管理的经验，确定了在今年实施现金管理的基础上，进一步在明年实行货币管理，并制订了完成这个艰巨任务的各项制度和办法。
    会议认为，由于中央决定实行现金管理政策的正确适时，各级领导部门的重视支持和各国家企业、机关、部队、合作社的拥护执行，以及各级银行的努力贯彻，使现金管理获得显著的成绩。这主要表现在：将分散在各国家机关企业的现金迅速而大量地集中到国家银行，因而做到有计划地使用；实现了现金收支平衡，稳定了物价；解决了为活跃整个国民经济所不可少的贸易生产资金的困难。会议同时指出，这一成绩只是初步完成了现金归行的任务，今后必须更进一步，逐渐达到有计划地调剂货币流通，实现出纳计划化，使国家银行在今后整个国民经济的恢复与发展中发挥更大的作用。会议根据明年整个国家建设需要及可能条件，认为有进一步实行货币管理的必要。经详细研究讨论后，会议制订了实行货币管理的各项制度和办法。这些制度和办法已呈送政务院，将于批准后公布实行。
