Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 7th: The anti-insult and anti-defamation struggle at Nanjing Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences and Jinling University has expanded into a city-wide movement to accuse American imperialism of its crimes of aggression.

On the morning of the 6th, over seven thousand professors, students, staff, and Christian representatives from sixteen universities and middle schools, including Nanjing University, Jinling University, and Mingde Girls' Middle School, held an accusation meeting, further exposing the various crimes of aggression committed by American imperialism in China. Chen Heqin, a professor at Nanjing University, said at the meeting: "From middle school and university to studying in the United States, I have always been a person educated and cultivated by American imperialism. After returning to China, I went to run a school in the Shanghai concessions. However, the schools in the concessions were all engaged in enslaving education of our young students by imperialism, training lackeys to serve imperialism. For example, the two primary schools run by the Shanghai Municipal Council at that time were not allowed to raise the national flag or sing the national anthem. The history class was not allowed to teach the 'Opium War' lesson. The purpose was to train Chinese children into slaves who wholeheartedly served imperialism. Although I have received one or twenty years of education from American imperialism, I only have anger and hatred." Chen Xu, a student at Nanjing University's School of Medicine, resentfully accused [American Imperialism]. He was influenced by the poison of American imperialist education, and once thought that life was a dream and there was no struggle. He felt that there was no future, so he was depressed, pessimistic, and often wanted to commit suicide. Xu Funing, a student at Jinling University, said: The American professors at Jinling University, Lin Zhaoli and Rui Taoan, are concrete executors of American imperialist aggression conspiracies.

Wu Zhen, a professor at Jinling University who once served in the Kuomintang puppet Executive Yuan Relief Administration, exposed the conspiracy played by the United States under the guise of relief supplies. He said: American imperialism, under the guise of relief, destroyed the riverbed of our Yellow River, flooding and killing millions of our people's lives and property; and under the guise of relief, it stole our territorial waters, airspace and other sovereign rights from the Kuomintang traitorous government. These relief supplies are all stained with the blood of the Chinese people. Christians who participated in the accusation meeting also accused American imperialism of its atrocities. Shen Shaoshan, a Christian representative of Mingde Girls' Middle School, said: "The shameless behavior of American imperialism has ignited our anger, and we are irreconcilable with it. Christianity is about universal love and opposes aggression. Imperialist elements like Fei Ruisi are traitors to Christianity." At the meeting, students, faculty and staff of various schools were filled with righteous indignation and put forward practical actions to strengthen the power of resisting America and aiding Korea. Ye Zhongtan, a student at Nanjing University, had his entire family killed by Japanese imperialism, and he decided to avenge his father. He said: We will never allow American imperialism, which is more ferocious than the Japanese invaders, to slaughter Chinese compatriots again. Thirty students from the Municipal Sixth Middle School immediately requested to sign up to participate in various military cadre schools. The school also launched a craze for donating hand grenades and making condolence bags.

Jinling University and Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences have jointly formed an appeal group to go to various parts of East China to conduct accusations.

    南京大学、金陵大学等校七千师生控诉美帝文化侵略
    【新华社南京七日电】南京金陵女子文理学院、金陵大学的反侮辱、反诽谤斗争已扩展为全市性的控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行的运动。
    南京大学、金陵大学、明德女中等十六个大、中学校的教授、学生、员工和基督教徒代表共七千余人于六日上午举行了控诉大会，进一步揭发美帝国主义在中国的各种侵略罪行。南京大学教授陈鹤琴在大会上说：“我从中学、大学到去美国留学，一直是受美帝国主义教育培养出来的人。我自回国后，曾到上海租界里办学校。可是租界里的学校都是帝国主义对我们青年学生进行奴化教育，培养为帝国主义服务的奴才的。例如当时上海工部局办的两个小学，就不许升国旗，不许唱国歌。历史课不准教授‘鸦片战争’一课。其目的就是要把中国儿童训练成死心塌地为帝国主义服务的奴隶。我虽然受了美帝国主义一、二十年教育，但我只有愤怒和痛恨。”南京大学医学院学生陈旭忿恨地控诉。他受了美帝国主义教育毒素的影响，曾经认为人生是个梦，没有什么斗争。他感到没有前途，因而消沉、悲观，常常想自杀。金陵大学学生许复宁说：金大美籍教授林查礼、芮陶庵就是美帝国主义侵略阴谋的具体执行者。
    曾在国民党伪行政院救济总署服务的金陵大学教授吴桢揭发美国在救济物资名义下所玩弄的阴谋。他说：美帝国主义假借救济之名，破坏了我国的黄河河道，放水淹杀了我国千万人民的生命、财产；并假借救济为名，从国民党卖国政府那里，窃取了我国的领海、领空等主权。这些救济物资都涂满了中国人民的鲜血。参加控诉大会的基督教徒也纷纷控诉美帝国主义的暴行。明德女中基督教徒代表沈少珊说：“美帝国主义的无耻行为，已燃烧起我们的愤怒，我们和它誓不两立。基督教是讲博爱并反对侵略的，像费睿思等帝国主义分子，即是基督教的叛徒。”会上，各校学生、教职员工义愤填胸，纷纷提出以实际行动来加强抗美援朝的力量。南京大学学生叶中檀全家都被日本帝国主义杀害，他决定要为父亲报仇。他说：绝不容许比日寇更凶恶的美帝国主义再来屠杀中国同胞。市立第六中学当即有学生三十名坚决要求报名参加各种军事干部学校。该校并掀起了捐献手榴弹和作慰问袋的热潮。
    金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院已联合组成呼吁团，分赴华东各地进行控诉。
