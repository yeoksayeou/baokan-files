    BENGU EAST LINE MA CUN TEAM FINISHES EARLY
    [This newspaper's report] In the Bengbu City East Line Huai River harnessing project, the Ma Cun team of the City East Detachment has victoriously completed the first phase of the project ahead of schedule. This team is the most efficient team in the detachment. The team was responsible for constructing a new 50-meter embankment section. The regular workforce consisted of 119 earthworkers (sometimes increasing or decreasing). Work started on November 22nd and was completed to the required standard by December 18th. (During the work, three squads were transferred to help the Wangtai team for ten days; otherwise, the completion time would have been even earlier). The team worked a total of nineteen and a half clear days, with the earthworkers moving a total of 5,616 cubic meters of earth. The average work efficiency was 2.49 cubic meters per person per day. The earthworkers earned a total of 9,744 catties and eleven taels of rice in wages. The 34 ramming workers earned a total of 3,510 catties and twelve taels of rice in wages. The earthworker Su Changfu's squad of fourteen laborers, from November 21st to December 4th, carried 444 cubic meters of earth in nine days, averaging 3.5 cubic meters per person per day, creating the highest work efficiency record in the entire detachment. From the 19th, the team has been opening new borrow pits on other sections to continue the project. Due to their high labor efficiency, they won the red flag in the red flag competition organized by the detachment on the 19th of this month. The morale of the laborers in the team is even higher than before. Many laborers touched the red flag and said, "This is so good! We won't be flooded after the dam is built, we get rice to overcome the famine, and we get the red flag. It's really both fame and fortune!" "Work hard! We can't let others take the red flag away."

    BENGU SECTORS INITIATE A "CONTRIBUTE ONE CUBIC METER OF EARTH" MOVEMENT
    [This newspaper's report] Workers, government cadres, soldiers, students, teachers, and others in Bengbu City have enthusiastically initiated a "Contribute One Cubic Meter of Earth" movement. Since December 14th, the Huai River levee in Bengbu City has seen an additional 500 voluntary laborers every day.
    The city's "Contribute One Cubic Meter of Earth" movement was first initiated by the city's People's Representatives Conference, which passed a resolution to establish a One Cubic Meter of Earth Movement Committee to reinforce the levee section near Yetai Zi, east of the Henan Iron Bridge in Bengbu City. All people's organizations, workers, students, government cadres, soldiers, etc., in the city responded enthusiastically. The Bengbu City Federation of Trade Unions said in a letter to workers: "While American imperialists are actively invading our Taiwan and neighboring Korea, if each of the 10,000 workers in our city contributes one cubic meter of earth to harness the Huai River, we can save the country 25,000 catties of grain expenditure. In reality, it is equivalent to strengthening the anti-American and aid-Korea force by 25,000 catties of grain." Workers throughout the city have been signing up enthusiastically and have launched challenges to industrial and commercial circles, government agencies, troops, and schools throughout the city. Of the more than 300 members of the Bengbu City Federation of Literary and Art Circles, more than 200 had signed up to participate in just one hour on the morning of the 15th. Cadres from the Bengbu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Production and Disaster Relief Huai River Harnessing Headquarters, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the Anhui Northern Native Produce Company's retail department, the Anhui Northern Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and more than a thousand students from the Anhui Northern Cadre School have all enthusiastically signed up to participate. As of the 14th, more than 3,000 people had signed up. Many female comrades have also enthusiastically signed up. Everyone considers it an unparalleled honor to participate in this historic Huai River harnessing project.
    The first batch of volunteers from the Anhui Northern Cadre School, under the guidance of the city's One Cubic Meter of Earth Committee, arrived at the construction site on the 14th and began digging and building the levee.
    DISASTER-STRICKEN PEOPLE IN SUXIAN PREFECTURE RECEIVE WINTER CLOTHING AND JOIN THE HUAI RIVER HARNESSING EFFORT
    [This newspaper's report] Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life across the country, disaster-stricken people in Suxian Prefecture, Anhui Province, who lacked clothing to keep warm, have received warmth and are now joining the Huai River harnessing project to fight against the disasters left by the Chiang bandits. In the flood-stricken areas of the prefecture, approximately 30 to 60 percent of the total population lacked sufficient clothing. Since October 4th, the prefectural Production and Disaster Relief Committee has successively received winter clothing donated by people from all walks of life across the country, along with letters of condolence attached to the clothing. As of December 15th, incomplete statistics show that more than 1.7 million pieces of leather, cotton, lined, and unlined clothing; another 5,520 clothing boxes and bags; 18 billion yuan in winter clothing substitutes; and more than 341,000 pieces (pairs) of blankets, tents, shoes, and socks; and more than 72 feet of white cloth; and more than 26,000 catties of cotton have been received. The winter clothing is being distributed as soon as it arrives. Now, the winter clothing problem for the disaster-stricken people in the prefecture has been basically resolved. The disaster victims, now wearing warm clothes, are enthusiastically going to the dikes to harness the Huai River and work hard for production with a joyful mood. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 laborers from the entire prefecture are participating in the Huai River harnessing project.
