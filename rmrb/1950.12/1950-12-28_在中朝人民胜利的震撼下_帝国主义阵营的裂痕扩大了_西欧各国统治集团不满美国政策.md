Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Shaken by the victorious offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, the ruling groups in Western European countries have shown a rapidly growing dissatisfaction, hesitation, and shrinking from America's war policy. This reaction of Western Europe to American policy has been felt even by reactionary American journalists, politicians, and military men. Sulzberger, the New York Times correspondent in Paris, admitted in his dispatch on the 23rd: "Europeans are very disturbed by the hysteria in the United States caused by the setbacks in Korea. Europeans would like American leaders to show more cultivation, confidence, and perhaps more restraint."

The United Press Washington correspondent revealed in a telegram on the 21st the desperate calculations of "American military circles." They believe that "Western Europe will not fight to defend freedom (actually, to help American aggression)." A high-ranking officer said: "The French will not fight in any emergency, Belgium and the Netherlands are unreliable, and West Germany has not yet been armed." He estimated that the Western European "countries fighting communism" would only include Spain, Norway, Britain, and Turkey. "The Italian navy might be of some use." However, Newsweek was even more pessimistic. The magazine sadly admitted: "In fact, the United States is today facing the danger of fighting the Soviet Union alone. It is generally believed that in Europe only Britain, Finland, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Portugal, and Spain may provide effective assistance to the United States, and other allies will only join the fighting when victory is in sight. And if the Far East is the main battlefield, then Britain's position will also be ambiguous." The magazine revealed: "Last week, the Netherlands and Norway urged the United States not to take actions that might prolong the Korean War. Neutral Switzerland even recklessly stated that any discussions with Communist China should include the Taiwan issue and the issue of representation in the United Nations. At the end of last week, only Greece in Europe fully supported the American position."

Kingsbury Smith, the president of the United Press, expressed the same view, saying: "I have spoken with the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of Britain, the Premier and Foreign Minister of France, and Chancellor Adenauer of West Germany, as well as many intellectual leaders. I am very clear that the prevailing view in Europe is: The 'United Nations' should end the Korean War as soon as possible in order to transfer the troops there to Europe. The Europeans themselves see the war in Asia as nothing more than a diversion, a nightmare, and a bottomless pit into which Westerners will fall."

Regarding the shrinking of its Western European partners, Gallagher, the Associated Press correspondent in West Germany, angrily denounced the attitude of Western European governments as "isolationism," and scolded "most European countries preferring to crawl into a hole and hide, without asking about the situation in other countries in the world." He rebuked Britain for refusing to participate in the Schuman Plan, rebuked Sweden for refusing to join the North Atlantic Treaty, and lamented that although France was active in European affairs, it excluded its attitude towards Germany, and was even less enthusiastic in the Far East, "the strength it has provided for the Korean War is only a small gunboat." Gallagher expressed bewilderment at Europe's "isolationism," but he unconsciously revealed that this is actually the nature of the alliance between imperialist countries. He said: "In the economic field, almost all European countries have varying degrees of nationalism. West Germany, under the stimulus of the United States, once implemented a policy of free trade, but because other countries refused to abolish their barriers, West Germany had to retreat from its position of complete free trade." According to his own definition, Gallagher called the American policy of invading Western Europe and coercing Western Europe to serve its aggression "internationalism," but he could not help but feel sad that this "internationalism" lacked sympathy in Asia and Europe.

    在中朝人民胜利的震撼下
    帝国主义阵营的裂痕扩大了
    西欧各国统治集团不满美国政策
    【新华社二十六日讯】在中朝人民军队的胜利攻势震撼下，西欧各国统治集团对美国的战争政策表现了迅速增长的不满、犹豫以及畏缩。西欧对美国政策的这种反应，连美国的反动记者与政客军人们也都已感觉出来。纽约时报驻巴黎记者苏兹伯格在其二十三日的通讯中就承认：“欧洲人对于美国因在朝鲜受挫而起的歇斯底里感到非常不安。欧洲人愿意美国领袖们表现更多的修养、信心，也许还要更多的自制。”
    合众社华盛顿记者在二十一日的电讯中透露了“美国军界人士”绝望的算计。他们认为“西欧将不会为保卫自由（实际上是为帮助美国侵略）而战”。一位高级军官说：“法国人在任何危急的时候都不会作战，比利时与荷兰都是不可靠的，而西德却还没有武装起来”。他估计西欧“对共产主义作战的国家”只会有西班牙、挪威、英国与土耳其。“意大利的海军会有些用处”。但是，美国新闻周刊甚至比他还要悲观些。该刊黯然承认：“事实上美国今日是单独面对与苏联作战的危险。一般人认为在欧洲方面仅有英国、芬兰、土耳其、南斯拉夫、葡萄牙、及西班牙等国可能予美国以有效援助，其他盟国将只在胜利可期时才参加作战。而如果以远东为主要战场，则英国的立场亦将暧昧不明。”该刊透露：“上星期荷兰与挪威曾敦促美国勿采取可能延长朝鲜战争的行动。中立的瑞士更卤莽地表示与共产党中国作任何讨论时，应包括台湾问题与联合国内代表权的问题。上星期末，欧洲只有希腊全力支持美国立场。”
    合众社社长白里表示了同样的看法，他说：“我和英国的首相和外相，法国的总理和外长，以及西德的阿登纳总理谈过话，也和许多思想界的领袖谈过话。我心里很明白欧洲占优势的见解是：“联合国”应该尽快地结束朝鲜战争，以便把那里的军队调赴欧洲。欧洲人自己看来，亚洲的战争不过是一种牵制、一种梦魔以及西方人将掉进里面去的一个无底洞而已。
    对于其西欧伙伴的这种畏缩，美联社驻西德记者加拉格恨恨地大骂西欧各国政府的态度是“孤立主义”，大骂“大多数的欧洲国家宁愿爬进洞里去，隐藏起来，而不过问世界其他各国的情况如何”。他斥责英国拒绝参加舒曼计划，斥责瑞典拒绝参加北大西洋公约，而惋叹法国虽然在欧洲事务上积极，却要把对德国的态度除外，而在远东就更不热心，“它对朝鲜战争所提供的力量只是一艘小型炮舰”。加拉格对欧洲的这种“孤立主义”表示惶惑，但是他自己就不自觉地道出了这实际上正是帝国主义国家间同盟的本色。他说：“在经济方面，几乎所有的欧洲国家都存在着不同程度的民族主义。西德在美国的刺激下曾经一度施行自由贸易的政策，但是因为其他国家拒绝取消它们的壁垒，西德不得不从它的完全自由贸易的阵地上退却了。”按照他自己的定义，加拉格把美国侵略西欧，并胁迫西欧为其侵略服务的政策称做“国际主义”，但是他不能不为这种“国际主义”在亚欧缺乏同情而感到悲哀。
