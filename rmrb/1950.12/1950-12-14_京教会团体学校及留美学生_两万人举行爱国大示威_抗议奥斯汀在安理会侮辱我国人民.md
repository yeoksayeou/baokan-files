    [Report from this newspaper] Beijing church groups, schools, hospitals, and returned students from the U.S., totaling 20,000 people, held a patriotic demonstration and parade on the 13th as a response to the absurd speech made by Austin at the UN Security Council on November 28th, which insulted the Chinese people.

    The rally was held at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace. Attendees included church groups such as the North China and Beijing Christian Joint Council, Methodist Church, and Chinese Anglican Church; church schools such as Yenching University, Chongshi Middle School, Gengxin Middle School, and Bridgman Academy; church hospitals such as Daoji and Renguang; and over fifty units including Tsinghua University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Peking Union Medical College, as well as returned students from the U.S. in Beijing, totaling 20,000 people.

    The rally began at 1 p.m. Lu Zhiwei, Chairman of the Yenching University School Board, first angrily denounced Austin's shameless speech at the Security Council as a naked exposure of the U.S. imperialists' vicious plot to carry out cultural aggression against China. Mr. Lu Zhiwei pointed out that today's demonstration and parade is a powerful response from the Chinese people who have stood up to the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University who has taught at the university for twenty-five years, excitedly stated that two months ago, all teachers, students, and staff of Fu Jen Catholic University had driven out the imperialist aggressors, a fact that Austin dared not and would not mention. President Chen Yuan pointed out that this was the result of the victory of the people's great revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao. He shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao," and the cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao" rose and fell across the venue, lasting for a long time. Professor Pan Guangdan, who studied at the Preparatory School for Studying in the U.S. (the predecessor of Tsinghua University) from a young age, studied in the United States after graduation, and has been teaching at Tsinghua University since returning to China, represented the returned students from the U.S. in denouncing U.S. imperialism's cultural aggression against China based on his personal experience. Religious figure Bishop Ling Xianyang of the Chinese Anglican Church held the Bible and used the Gospel of Matthew to denounce Austin and other Wall Street lackeys, saying: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you strain out a gnat and swallow a camel. You clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness!" Yu Xiuai, President of the Young Women's Christian Association; Fu Zhongtao, Principal of Jingcun Middle School and a Catholic; and Tian Changqing, Principal of Chongshi Middle School and a Christian, all angrily denounced the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to use religion for aggression. They stated that whether Chinese Christians or Catholics, they are all loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people, and from now on, they will cherish the Central People's Government, strengthen unity, and actively participate in the Resist U.S., Aid Korea movement and expand the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation movement. Xia Zhiqiang, Chairman of the Yenching University Student Union, and Ling Ruiji, Chairman of the Tsinghua University Student Union, both explained that Chinese students—including students in church schools—have always loved their country and opposed imperialist aggression. The rally was filled with the emotions of the victorious and awakened Chinese people hating and despising U.S. imperialism.

    The rally then unanimously passed the declaration protesting Austin's shameless slander, the telegram to the UN Security Council, and the letter to Chairman Mao. The rally also read out the newly returned students from the U.S. declaration and the statement of returned students from the U.S. in Beijing.

    At 2 p.m., the parade began. The presidium of the rally, including Lu Zhiwei, Chairman of the Yenching University School Board; Zhao Zichen, President of the Theological Seminary; Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University; Qian Weichang, Provost of Tsinghua University; Li Zong'en, President of Peking Union Medical College; religious figures Gao Fengshan, Ling Xianyang, Chen Zhewen, Fu Zhongtao, Tian Changqing, Zhao Fusan, Yu Xiuai, and Liu Zhiting; and returned student representatives Pan Guangdan, Zheng Linzhuang, and Lei Jieqiong, led the way, followed by the ranks of returned students, church groups, church schools, and church hospitals. The marching crowd shouted slogans such as "Oppose deception, oppose slander, oppose insult!" "Protest Austin's insult to the Chinese people!" "Crush U.S. imperialist cultural aggression!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" They marched from Dongjiaomin Lane to Dongdan and Dongsi. When the procession passed in front of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the returned student contingent shouted "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" When the parade passed in front of the former U.S. Embassy, which had been taken back, the marching crowd shouted "Down with U.S. imperialism!" Zhang Huai, a professor at Fu Jen Catholic University, excitedly said: "Ten years ago, this procession could not have passed through here (Dongjiaomin Lane). Today, the Chinese people have truly stood up under the leadership of Chairman Mao!"

    [Report from this newspaper] More than forty returned students from the U.S. at the Political Research Institute of the North China People's Revolutionary University held a forum on the evening of the 12th, angrily protesting Austin's insult to returned students from the U.S., and unanimously expressed that the purpose of participating in the parade was: to let Austin know the anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit of Chinese students who have returned from the U.S. To tell U.S. imperialism that its policy is unsuccessful, precisely because those who have studied in the United States have a clearer understanding of the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism, so they must oppose it even more.

    【本报讯】北京华北人民革命大学政治研究院四十余留美同学，于十二日晚举行座谈会，愤怒抗议奥斯汀对留美学生的侮蔑，并一致表示参加游行的目的：是要使奥斯汀知道中国留美同学的反帝的革命精神。告诉美帝，它的政策是不成功的，正因为是在美国读过书的人，就对美帝侵略面目认识得更清楚，所以越要反对它。
