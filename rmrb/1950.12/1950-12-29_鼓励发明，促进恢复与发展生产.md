Encouraging invention to promote the recovery and development of production
    In order to promote the recovery and development of production, we must encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, technicians, staff members, and all those engaged in scientific and technological research related to production. This will enable them to fully utilize their knowledge, experience, and wisdom to devote themselves to invention, technical improvement, and rationalization proposals. This is of paramount importance to the cause of national economic construction.
    Decision of the Government Administration Council on August 11, 1950, regarding awards for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production.
