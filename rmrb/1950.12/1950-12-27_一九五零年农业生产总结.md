    1950 Agricultural Production Summary
    The Yuci District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Editor's Note: The "1950 Agricultural Production Summary" of the Yuci District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party demonstrates the enormous achievements of farmers organized to improve agricultural production after the land reform. The fact that more than 150 villages in the seven counties of the newly liberated areas have reached or exceeded pre-war levels is further evidence of the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in the New China. We hope that local Party committees will send such summary articles to this newspaper for publication.

    I. Production Results

    In 1950, agricultural production in our district was carried out under the conditions of gradually correcting the direction and policies, fighting against continuous and relatively serious natural disasters, and fighting against hidden enemies and all saboteurs.

    According to typical surveys and our usual estimations of available materials, production in both old and new areas, except for Yuci and Mengxian, increased compared to last year. However, more than one-third of the areas did not complete this year's production increase task, mainly due to the difficult-to-resist natural disasters. According to statistics from the seven counties of Yushe, Heshun, Zuoquan, Shouyang, Lingshi, Qixian, and Pingding: the total autumn land was 3,619,346 mu, an actual increase of 348,327 shi compared to last year, with an average increase of 9.6 sheng per mu compared to last year, reaching 91.33 percent of the pre-war level. Due to the uneven work foundation, different natural conditions, and different levels of disaster impact this year, the production results this year also varied across the district: (1) In the old areas (excluding Mengxian), there are approximately 1,200 administrative villages, of which about 25 percent exceeded the pre-war level by 5 to 20 percent, about 35 percent reached the pre-war level, and about 40 percent reached 90 percent or more of the pre-war level. The average across the entire counties of Xiyang, Heshun, and Yushe exceeded pre-war levels, with Xiyang exceeding by 1.11 dou, Yushe exceeding by 0.376 dou, and Heshun exceeding by approximately 0.4 dou. Mengxian, except for a very small number of villages that exceeded pre-war levels, saw a county-wide reduction in production of 17 percent due to severe disasters, reaching only 64.8 percent of the pre-war level. (2) In the new areas, Shouyang, Taigu, Qixian, Pingyao, and Jiexiu counties reached 85 to 90 percent of pre-war levels, Lingshi reached 83 percent of pre-war levels, and Yuci reached 71 percent of pre-war levels. In the seven counties of the new areas, there was a small portion of villages (approximately 150 villages) that reached or exceeded pre-war levels.

    Cash crops (missing three counties): The actual cotton planting area was 106,116 mu, an increase of 54,818 mu compared to last year, exceeding this year's original plan of 99,950 mu by 6.1 percent. Each mu produced approximately 25 jin of ginned cotton. The actual planting area for hemp was 89,752 mu, an increase of 41,078 mu compared to last year; the actual planting area for peanuts in five counties was 2,372 mu, an increase of 1,035 mu compared to last year; the actual planting area for tobacco in five counties was 1,548 mu, an increase of 604 mu compared to last year.

    Other livestock such as pigs, sheep, and chickens also increased significantly.

    On a district-wide scale, the task of increasing production this year has been basically completed.

    II. Reasons for Increased Production

    First, there was a widespread surge in farmers' production enthusiasm. The formation of this situation was due to: (1) The end of the war and the basic completion of land reform, giving the masses of farmers the basic conditions for restoring production. (2) We gradually corrected the direction and policies of rural production. In the first half of the year, we focused on implementing policies to protect private property rights and various production incentives, and in the second half of the year, we focused on implementing the direction of organizing and improving technology, which played a significant role in dispelling farmers' ideological concerns and clarifying the future path of production. This stabilized and increased the production enthusiasm of the masses of farmers. (3) In order to implement production leadership, large-scale mobilization work has been carried out throughout the year. Various counties have held cadre meetings, activist meetings, representatives meetings, Party representative meetings, labor model meetings, technical personnel training classes, and Party member training classes, etc., totaling no less than 50,000 people, most of whom played a huge role in promoting the production movement. The old areas also carried out activities such as inspection, evaluation, observation, and selection of labor models in the villages. Various places also carried out propaganda and encouragement work through blackboards, slideshows, rooftop broadcasts, and people's schools, which boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses of farmers.

    Second, we opposed the tendency to mechanically copy the superior's formulas and insisted on a leadership method that focused on grasping the links to increase production based on the specific conditions of each county. For example: (1) Construction of water conservancy projects and reform of the feudal water conservancy system. The entire district built 80 new canals and dams, restored 76 old canals, 246 bridge gates, and 46 dams, promoted 1,270 new and old-style waterwheels, and dug more than 200 self-flowing wells and 825 old-style wells, totaling a new addition of 168,638 mu of paddy fields, completing 67.4 percent of the original plan. Together with the existing paddy fields, the total was 1,104,744 mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 53 percent. We basically abolished unreasonable feudal water regulations and systems: water distribution systems, financial systems, and management systems have been fundamentally reformed, which greatly reduced water disputes, strengthened the unity of the masses, and basically achieved the goal of making full use of water. (2) Elimination of wasteland. The entire district, except for Mengxian, reclaimed a total of 156,076 mu of wasteland, which is estimated to increase production by more than 70,000 shi, completing 97.7 percent of the original plan. (3) Soil improvement. In Yushe, Pingyao, Jiexiu, Qixian and other eight counties, preliminary statistics show that a total of 84,704 mu were improved, generally increasing production by more than 30 percent compared to ordinary land (Yushe increased production by about 100 percent). This movement was carried out more universally and in an organized manner in Yushe. (4) The application of fertilizer has increased everywhere. In the old areas, each mu generally receives 30 to 40 dan, exceeding pre-war levels; in the new areas, each mu receives 10 to 20 dan, reaching approximately 80 percent of pre-war levels. (5) We advocated new scientific technologies, promoted inherent correct experiences, and combined the two. There has been considerable progress in this area this year, and attention to technology has become a common practice. For example: warm water soaking and drug seed mixing, after propaganda mobilization and the lead of labor models, cadres, and Party member activists, and through germination experiments, in Zuoquan, Heshun, Xiyang, Yushe and other advanced villages in the old areas, accounted for about 60 to 70 percent of the total cultivated land. In the new areas, it also accounted for 30 percent, and the general effect was good. The promotion of improved varieties (missing four counties), according to preliminary statistics, totaled 27,260 mu, and the promotion of local improved varieties was 80,836 mu, all with significant increases in production. Autumn seed selection has received more attention in various places than in the past, and good villages mostly exceeded the amount needed by the village. The promotion of new machinery and agricultural tools began to be experimented with in areas with better organization. A total of 104 new agricultural tools and 470 sprayers were promoted in the entire district. In terms of the transformation and creation of old agricultural tools, five types have been successfully developed, including seeding plows, wheeled plows, human-pulled hoes, fertilizer sowers, and manure collectors. Fine farming has exceeded pre-war levels in both old and new areas. General autumn crops have been hoed three times, with a few hoed twice or four times; repairing edges and building embankments has formed a movement in mountainous areas with the greatest results. The rough practices of the new areas in the past have also been greatly overcome. This year, a large number of technical experts emerged in the production movement, especially experienced old farmers who were universally respected in the old areas. Almost all of the 2,850 labor models in the entire district (excluding Yangquan) were technically excellent. The entire district (excluding Yangquan) trained 6,381 technicians. According to incomplete statistics, there were 849 village technical committees in the old areas, which generally played a role, coupled with the guidance and assistance of state-owned farms, which has formed the backbone force for promoting and improving technology.

    Third, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in production. Although the number of mutual aid groups in the old areas with a better foundation has decreased compared to last year, the quality has been newly improved. Generally, it accounts for about 70 percent of the number of households (about 80 percent last year), of which the good ones account for about 45 percent, the average ones account for 45 percent, and those with little effect, unequal value, or belonging to labor exchange account for less than 10 percent. The situation of so-called "formal groups" has been greatly overcome. In the old areas with a weak foundation, it accounts for about 20 percent, and the quality is generally lower than the former. Mutual aid groups have begun to be established in some villages in the new areas. Although there are achievements in increasing production, the issue of equivalent value has not been truly resolved. Labor exchange groups are more common. The result of mutual aid has improved production technology, enhanced planning, and increased labor productivity. The surplus labor force has been used for land processing or sideline production. Therefore, the income of farmers has greatly increased, demonstrating the superiority of organization. According to several survey materials, organized production generally exceeds that of individual farming by 10 to 25 percent. In labor exchange, it generally plays a role in improving labor efficiency and overcoming the difficulties of labor and animal power. Although the number of mutual aid groups in the entire district is not large, it is the basic reason for increasing production among farmers in the old areas with a better foundation and a portion of farmers in other areas.

    Fourth, the work of fighting against natural disasters has been carried out throughout the year. The entire district suffered continuous and severe disasters this year, but the people of the entire district also made efforts in various aspects to fight. (1) First of all, in the disaster-stricken areas, focusing on self-salvation through production, we fully organized the work of replanting, supplementary planting, and rushing to sow seeds in wet conditions, carried out the work of opening canals and digging wells and sideline production, implemented the ideological education of "man can conquer nature" among cadres and the masses, overcame some superstitious backward, relying on heaven for food, relying on relief and other erroneous views and pessimistic emotions, cracked down on the reactionary saboteurs' rumors, confusion, sabotage and other conspiracies, and discussed remedial measures with the masses, thus stabilizing and improving the masses' fighting spirit. (2) We implemented the policy of "prevention first". Such as seed selection, soaking, mixing, frost prevention, and replanting, certain preparations were made in advance, which played a significant role, especially the completion of flood control projects, so that production this year did not suffer serious water damage. (3) We organized mountain hunting with a focus. In addition to generally mobilizing the masses and militia to organize patrols to watch the fields and hunt mountains, we focused on organizing mountain hunting teams (or groups) by the militia combined with hunting experts. Some areas have eliminated mountain pests in one area. In order to promote their enthusiasm, we carried out work such as offsetting labor, rewarding praise, and reasonably distributing harvests (animal skins, meat, bones, etc.). (4) In areas with cooperatives, certain work was carried out to solve material difficulties for the masses and organize sideline production, and great results were also obtained. For example, the Dafotou Village in Heshun organized the picking of tree seeds to earn 20,000 jin of rice, making up for more than half of the disaster losses; a certain village's labor model led the collection of medicinal herbs, transportation, and selling labor to earn 123 shi of rice, solving the difficulties of 40 households. As a result of organizing self-salvation through production in Pingding County, only 50 shi of relief grain was used. Many places used relief grain as capital to engage in production, solving the difficulties and saving public grain.

    Fifth, we have fought against hidden enemies and all acts of sabotage to production, basically ensuring the safety of rural production order. In the summer and autumn seasons, we launched a mass movement to protect production, with the militia and Party members as the backbone, uniting the masses, forming a mass public security team. After ideological mobilization, the masses of farmers formulated covenants for protecting wheat and autumn crops, improved joint defense, carried out the transformation of hooligans and lazy people, and strictly enforced the law. We basically abolished the field patrol system, so the order of the summer and autumn harvests this year was unprecedentedly good and gained the support of the masses. They said: "Chairman Mao's method is good, it reduces lost work, and it is effective. Everyone is responsible, the strength is great, there are many people and many eyes, which saves money and watches the fields. In the past, hiring people to watch the fields, losing the fields and crops, and still having to pay wages," "Problems that have not changed in a lifetime have changed this year," "The order has not been as good as this year for several years." In addition, we have also carried out two large-scale propaganda offensives to suppress counter-revolutionaries, mainly to expose rumors, attack the Yiguandao and other reactionary activities in terms of public opinion, overcome ideological confusion, and stabilize the emotions of the masses. The progress of this work was best in Pingding.

    Sixth, we have continuously emphasized the work of cultivating land on behalf of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and universally implemented the contracting system or the work ticket system, so that the situation of cultivating land on their behalf this year exceeded any previous year (their land has increased production compared to last year).

    III. Shortcomings in Production and Future Tasks

    Although agricultural production this year has basically completed the task, due to the extremely uneven work foundation, the vast areas have not yet formed an organized and planned mass movement except for the old areas with a better foundation. Looking at the leadership of the Party branch over production, most areas are still in a state of spontaneous or semi-spontaneous flow. In order to change this situation, the following aspects of work must be carried out: (1) Continue to implement the direction of rural production. The main task is to universally carry out a mass movement that combines production mutual aid, supply and marketing cooperation, and improved technology. (2) Rectify and build rural Party branches, and on this basis, improve the organization and system of rural people's democratic dictatorship. (3) The leading organs of the Party at all levels must learn and implement the leadership method of the mass line. The main thing is to be good at using the method of creating typical examples and relying on labor models to promote the production movement. Only in this way can agricultural production next year move forward.

    一九五零年农业生产总结
    中共榆次地委
    编者按：中共榆次地委“一九五○年农业生产总结”，显示了土地改革后农民组织起来提高农业生产的巨大成绩。在新解放区的七个县的一百五十余村亦已达到或者超过战前水平，更是新中国农业生产迅速恢复和发展的明证。我们希望各地党委都能将此类总结性的文章寄给本报发表。
    一、生产的结果
    一九五○年我区的农业生产，是在逐步地端正方向政策、与连续不断而又较为严重的自然灾害进行斗争、并与隐蔽的敌人及一切破坏分子进行斗争的条件下进行的。
    生产的结果，根据典型调查与我们平时占有材料的推算不论新老区，除盂县、榆次外均较去年增产，但有三分之一以上地区没有完成今年的增产任务，其主要原因是由于难于抗拒的自然灾害的袭击。据榆社、和顺、左权、寿阳、灵石、祁县、平定等七个县的统计：共有秋地三、六一九、三四六亩，较去年实增产三四八、三二七石，平均每亩比去年增产九升六合，达战前水平的百分之九一点三三。由于工作基础的不平衡，由于自然条件的优劣不同，由于今年受灾轻重的不同，以致今年全区生产结果也各不相同：（一）在老区（除盂县外），大约有一千二百多个行政村，其中超过战前水平百分之五至二十者约占百分之二十五，达到战前水平者约百分之三十五左右，达战前水平百分之九十以上者约百分之四十左右。昔阳、和顺、榆社三县全县平均超过战前水平，计昔阳超过一斗一升一，榆社超过三升七合六，和顺超过四升左右。盂县除极少数村庄超过战前水平外，全县因灾情严重，比去年减产百分之十七，只达战前水平的百分之六十四点八。（二）在新区，寿阳、太谷、祁县、平遥、介休五县达战前水平的百分之八十五至九十，灵石达战前百分之八十三，榆次达战前水平的百分之七十一。在新区七县中，均有一小部分村庄（约计一百五十余村）达到或者超过战前水平。
    经济作物（缺三个县）：棉花实种一○六、一一六亩，比去年增加五四、八一八亩，超过今年原计划九九、九五○亩的百分之六点一。每亩约产皮棉二十五斤。麻皮实种八九、七五二亩，比去年增加四一、○七八亩，花生五个县实种二、三七二亩较去年增加一、○三五亩，烟叶五个县实种一、五四八亩比去年增加六○四亩。
    其他猪、羊、鸡等也都有大量增加。
    在全区范围内，基本上完成了今年的增产任务。
    二、增产的原因
    第一、是农民生产情绪的普遍高涨。这种情况的形成是由于：（一）战争结束，土改基本上完成之后，农民群众获得了恢复生产的基本条件。（二）我们逐步地端正农村生产的方向政策。前半年集中贯彻了保障私有财产权及各项生产奖励政策，后半年又着重贯彻了组织起来与提高技术的方向，在解除农民思想顾虑和明确今后生产道路方面，起了很大的作用。因而稳定和提高了农民群众的生产积极性。（三）为了贯彻生产领导，一年以来进行了大规模的动员工作，各县曾召开过干部会、积极分子会、各界代表会、党代表会议、劳动模范会议、技术人员训练班和党员训练班等，总共不下五万余人，其中大部分人起了推动生产运动的巨大作用。老区并在乡村中进行了检查、评比、观摩、评选劳模等活动。各地还进行了黑板报、幻灯、屋顶广播、民校等宣传鼓励工作，鼓舞了农民群众的生产情绪。
    第二、反对了照搬上级一套的公式主义倾向，坚持了根据各县具体条件，抓取增产环节的领导方法。如：（一）兴修水利与改革封建的水利制度。全区新筑水渠、坝堰八十道，恢复旧水渠七十六条，桥闸二四六座，坝堰四十六个，推广新旧式水车一、二七○辆，凿自流井二○○多眼，旧式水井八二五眼，总计新增水田一六八、六三八亩，完成原计划百分之六十七点四，连同旧有水田总共一、一○四、七四四亩，超过战前百分之五十三。基本上废除了不合理的封建水规与制度：水程制度、财政制度、管理制度，均有基本的改革，这便大大减少了水利纠纷，增强了群众团结，基本上达到水尽其用的目的。（二）消灭荒地。全区除盂县外，共垦荒一五六、○七六亩，约可增产七○、○○○余石，完成原计划的百分之九七点七。（三）调剂土壤。在榆社，平遥、介休、祁县等八县，据初步统计共调剂了八四、七○四亩，一般比普通土地增产百分之三十以上（榆社则增产一倍左右）。这一运动在榆社是较普遍而又有组织地开展了。（四）施肥在各地均有增加，老区每亩一般在三十担至四十担，超过了战前；新区每亩十至二十担，约达战前百分之八十。（五）提倡新的科学技术，发扬固有的正确经验，并使二者结合起来，在这方面今年有不少进步，讲究技术已成普遍风气。如：温汤浸种和药剂拌种，经过宣传动员和劳模、干部、党员积极分子的带头，经过发芽试验的办法，在左权、和顺、昔阳、榆社及其他老区的先进村，约占耕地总数的百分之六十至七十。新区也有百分之三十，一般效果均好。推广优良品种（缺四个县），据初步统计，共二七、二六○亩，推广本地良种八○、八三六亩，均有显著增产。秋季选种，各地均较以往更加注意，好的村大多超过了本村所需数量。新式器械和农具的推广，在组织起来较好的地区开始实验，全区共推广新农具一○四件，喷雾器四七○个。在旧农具的改造与创造方面，有播种犁、轮犁、人拉锄、种粪耧、抓圊耧等五种已告成功。精耕细作不论新老区都超过战前水平，一般大秋作物均达到锄三次，少数锄二次或四次；修边垒堰，在山地已形成运动，成绩最大，新区历来的粗糙做法，也有很大克服。今年生产运动中涌现了大批的技术能手，特别是有经验的老农在老区普遍受到尊敬，全区二、八五○个劳模中几乎全部是技术优良者，全区（缺阳泉）曾训练了六、三八一个技术员，据不完全统计，老区有八四九个村的技术委员会，一般都能起作用，加以公营农场的指导与帮助，已形成推进和改进技术的骨干力量。
    第三，生产互助运动。互助组在基础较好的老区，虽然数量比去年减少，但质量都有了新的提高，一般达户数的百分之七十左右（去年为百分之八十左右），其中好的占百分之四十五左右，一般的占百分之四十五，作用不大、有不等价等问题或属于变工性者占百分之十以下，所谓“形式组”的情况，有了很大的克服。在基础薄弱的老区约占百分之二十左右，质量一般较前者低。新区互助组在若干村庄开始建立，虽然在增产上有成绩，但等价问题尚未真正解决。变工组则较普遍。互助的结果，提高了生产技术，增强了计划性，提高了劳动率，剩余劳力已经用于土地加工或副业生产。因此大大增加了农民的收入，表现了组织起来的优越性。据若干调查材料显示，组织起来的一般是比单干的产粮超过百分之十至二十五。在变工中一般都起了提高劳动效率和克服劳畜力困难的作用。虽然互助组在全区为数不大，但在基础较好的老区和其余地区的一部分农民当中，是增产的基本原因。
    第四、全年进行了向自然灾害作斗争的工作。今年全区遭受了连续的严重的灾害袭击，但全区人民也在各方面努力进行了斗争。（一）首先是在受灾地区以生产自救为中心，全力组织改种、补种与抢湿下种的工作，进行了开渠凿井和副业生产的工作，在干部、群众中贯彻了人定胜天的思想教育，克服了某些迷信落后、靠天吃饭、靠救济等错误观点和悲观情绪，打击了反动破坏分子的造谣惑众、捣乱破坏等阴谋活动，和群众一道商量了补救办法，因而安定并提高了群众的斗争情绪。（二）贯彻了预防第一的方针。诸如选浸拌种、防霜防冻、改种与补种等，在事前都进行了一定的准备工作，因而起了很大的作用，特别是完成了防洪工程，使今年生产未遭受严重的水害。（三）有重点地组织了打山。除一般发动群众、民兵组织巡查看田打山外，着重由民兵结合打猎能手组织了打山队（或组），某些地区已消灭了一方的山害，为发扬他们的积极性又进行了抵顶勤工、奖励表扬和合理分配收获物（兽皮、兽肉、兽骨等）的工作。（四）有合作社的地区，在为群众解决物质困难和组织副业生产方面，进行了若干工作，也获得了很大的成果。如和顺大佛头村组织打树籽赚米两万斤，弥补了一半以上的受灾损失；某村劳模领导采药运输卖工赚米一二三石，解决了四十多户的困难。平定全县组织生产自救的结果，救济粮只用了五十石，不少地方以救济粮为资本搞生产，解决了困难，又节省了公粮。
    第五、向隐蔽敌人和一切破坏生产的行为进行了斗争，基本上保障了农村生产秩序的安全。在夏秋两季开展了群众性的保卫生产运动，以民兵、党员为骨干团结群众，形成了群众性的治安队伍，经过思想发动，由农民群众订立护麦、护秋公约，健全联防，进行了改造流氓懒汉、严肃法纪等工作，基本上废除了巡田制度，所以今年夏收、秋收的秩序空前良好，并获得了群众拥护。他们说：“毛主席的办法就是好，误工少，又顶事，大家负责力量大，人多眼多，既省了钱又看了田，过去雇人看田，丢了田禾还得出工资”，“一辈子没改变了的问题，今年改变了”，“几年来没有今年秩序好”。此外又曾进行过两次较大规模的镇压反革命的宣传攻势，主要是揭穿谣言，从舆论上打击了一贯道和其他反动活动，克服了思想混乱，安定了群众情绪，此项工作的进行以平定为最好。
    第六、不断地强调了对烈，军，工属的代耕工作，普遍实行了包耕制或工票制，因而使今年的代耕状况超过以往任何一年（他们的土地较去年均有新增产）。
    三、生产中的缺点和今后任务。
    今年的农业生产虽然在基本上完成了任务，但由于工作基础的极不平衡，除基础较好的老区外，广大地区还没有形成为一个有组织、有计划的群众运动。以党支部对生产的领导来看，大部地区还处于自流或半自流状态。为了改变这一状况，必须进行下述几个方面的工作：（一）继续贯彻农村生产的方向。主要任务是普遍地开展一个将生产互助、供销合作与提高技术相互结合起来的群众运动。（二）整顿和建设农村党支部，并在这一基础上健全农村人民民主专政的组织与制度。（三）各级党的领导机关要学会并贯彻群众路线的领导方法。主要是善于运用创造典型和依靠劳动模范以推进生产运动的方法。只有如此，明年的农业生产才能前进一步。
