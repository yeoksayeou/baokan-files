    The "December 9th" Movement is not only a glorious memorial day for the Chinese youth movement but also a memorable day in the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle.

    Just as the "May Fourth" and "May Thirtieth" Movements were the prelude to the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, the heroic struggle that broke out first in Beiping on December 9th, fifteen years ago, and saw the unanimous rise of youth across the country to resolutely oppose Japanese aggression and the Kuomintang's traitorous policies, also played a certain role as a bugle call and driving force for the national anti-Japanese liberation war two years later.

    In this movement, Chinese youth demonstrated stronger unity and organizational strength, displayed a more tenacious fighting spirit, and employed more mature struggle tactics than in previous struggles. Through the tempering of this struggle, the broad masses of Chinese youth gained further political awareness. Day by day, they recognized the truth that only Marxism-Leninism could save China, and only the proletariat and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, could lead the national liberation struggle to final victory.

    After the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was no accident that millions of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters poured into Yan'an like a tide, went behind enemy lines, joined the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and dedicated themselves to the great revolutionary cause under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Over the past fifteen years, the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, up to the Chinese people's great victory today, have provided the Chinese youth generation with revolutionary education and tempering that is obviously a hundred times richer and a hundred times more substantial than the "December 9th" Movement and any era in history.

    In the people's New China, under the leadership and education of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese youth movement has embarked on a brand-new historical stage. On the one hand, the era of oppression, devastation, and enslaving education by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism is gone forever. Young people have a new, free, and healthy environment in all aspects of life, education, and work. Unfolding before them is a future of unlimited brightness and happiness. On the other hand, the great cause of construction in the people's motherland in military, political, economic, and cultural fields also requires every young person to shoulder more arduous tasks.

    Now, the US imperialists' expanded war of aggression against Korea is seriously threatening China's security and world peace. The people of the whole country have launched a universal upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the homeland, demanding to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and, together with the Korean people, give the US aggressors a head-on blow. The broad masses of young students, workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army soldiers are also standing at the forefront of the struggle in this great movement, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Recently, the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council decided to recruit a large number of young students and young workers to participate in various military schools and train various modern military technical cadres to accelerate national defense construction. The broad masses of young people responded to this call and have reported to apply for the examinations one after another. These are all the promotion and development of the glorious tradition of "December 9th" and a further high tide of the youth movement in New China.

    History is advancing, and Chinese youth are advancing. Let us cheer for the continued victory of New China! Let the dying imperialists and all the remaining reactionary forces tremble!

    发扬“一二九”的光荣传统中国青年要站在抗美援朝斗争的前列
    马叙伦
    “一二九”不仅是中国青年运动光辉的纪念日，同时在中国人民反帝反封建的革命斗争中也是一个可纪念的日子。
    正如“五四”“五卅”运动之为一九二五——二七年大革命的先声一样，十五年前十二月九日由北平首先爆发，全国青年一致起来坚决反对日寇侵略，反对国民党卖国政策的英勇斗争，对于两年后的全国抗日民族解放战争也是有其一定的号角作用与推动作用的。
    在这一次运动中，中国青年比以前历次斗争中表现了更坚强的团结与组织力量，发挥了更顽强的战斗精神，也运用了更成熟的斗争策略。经过这一次斗争的锻炼，广大中国青年有了进一步的政治觉悟，他们一天比一天认识了只有马列主义才能救中国，只有无产阶级及其先锋队中国共产党才能领导民族解放斗争到最后胜利的真理。
    抗日战争以后，千百万优秀的中华儿女潮水一般涌入延安，走入敌后，参加八路军和新四军，在中国共产党领导之下，献身于伟大的革命事业，决不是偶然的。
    十五年来，八年抗日战争与四年解放战争，一直到今天中国人民的伟大胜利，对于中国青年一代所给予的革命教育和锻炼比“一二九”以及历史上任何时代，显然更加百倍丰富，百倍充实。
    在人民的新中国，在伟大领袖毛主席与中国共产党的领导与教育之下，中国青年运动已经走上了一个崭新的历史阶段。一方面帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫、摧残与奴化教育时代是一去不复返了，青年们在生活、教育与工作各方面都有了一个新的自由与健康的环境，展开在他们面前的是一片无限光明幸福发展的前途。另一方面人民祖国在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面的建设大业，也要求每一个青年担负起更艰巨的任务。
    现在美帝国主义扩大侵略朝鲜战争，正在严重威胁着中国的安全与全世界和平。全国人民已经掀起了普遍的抗美援朝保家卫国的怒潮，风起云涌地要求参加中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民一道给美国侵略军以迎头痛击。广大青年学生、工人、农民、解放军战士在这一伟大运动中同样地站在斗争的最前列，表现了高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，最近中央人民政府革命军事委员会与政务院为加速国防建设决定招收广大青年学生、青年工人参加各种军事学校，培养各种现代军事技术干部，广大青年响应了这一号召，纷纷报告投考。这些都是“一二九”光荣传统的发扬光大，也是新中国青年运动更进一步的高潮。
    历史在前进，中国青年在前进，让我们为新中国的继续胜利而欢呼罢！让垂死挣扎的帝国主义和一切残余的反动势力发抖罢！
