    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 10th: Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a cable to the President of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the United Nations Security Council on the 7th, once again protesting the barbaric and bloody atrocities of the American invading forces in destroying residential areas. The cable pointed out: The American aggressors have destroyed all major industrial centers in Korea, as well as many towns and villages, through aerial bombardment, naval shelling, and other methods. Now that winter is approaching, they have begun to systematically destroy all remaining residential areas. American aircraft make more than a thousand flights every day, using scorched earth tactics, dropping large numbers of incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs on towns and villages with no military targets, destroying the homes and property of peaceful residents, and leaving millions homeless and unable to live.
    The cable expressed resolute protest against these crimes of the American aggressors, which blatantly violate recognized laws of war and rules of human morality, and stated: The Korean people, like all progressive humanity, undoubtedly want to know whether the United Nations has sanctioned the aforementioned illegal actions of the American armed forces in Korea.

    朝外相朴宪永电联合国
    再次抗议美军暴行
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社朝鲜北部讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于七日致电联合国本届大会主席及联合国安全理事会主席，再次抗议美国侵略军野蛮地破坏居民区的血腥暴行。电文指出：美国侵略者以空中轰炸、海上炮轰以及其他方法，毁坏了朝鲜所有的大工业中心，毁坏了许多城镇和农村。而在现在冬天来临时，他们开始有系统地破坏一切剩下的居民区。美国飞机每天作一千余次飞行，使用焦土战术，对毫无军事目标的市镇与乡村，投掷大量烧夷弹和高度爆炸弹，破坏和平居民的住房和财产，使千百万人无家可归，无法生活。
    电文对美国侵略者这些粗暴地违反公认的战争法则和人类道德规则的罪行，表示坚决抗议，并称：朝鲜人民无疑地像全体进步人类一样，愿意知道联合国对在朝鲜的美国武装部队的上述非法行动，是否已予制裁。
