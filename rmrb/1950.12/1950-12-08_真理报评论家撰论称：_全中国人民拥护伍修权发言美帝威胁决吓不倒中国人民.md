Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd: The *Pravda*'s international commentator, Korionov, wrote on December 3rd, commenting on the work of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, which discussed the issue of U.S. aggression against the People's Republic of China: For the first time in the United Nations, the voice of the true representative of the Chinese people resounded, the government this voice represents, its stability and the people's support for it, is unparalleled in Chinese history.

The speech of the Chinese representative, Wu Hsiu-chuan, in the Security Council was a true indictment of U.S. imperialism, which launched a war of aggression against the Chinese and other Asian peoples. The Chinese representative proved, based on irrefutable facts, that U.S. imperialists had been pursuing a policy of aggression against China for a long time. They spare no effort to complete the military encirclement of the People's Republic of China and turn China's neighboring countries into springboards for direct military attacks against China. Therefore, one of the most important goals of U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is to turn Korea into a bridgehead for military aggression against China.

Using the Korean region occupied by them, the U.S. war-mongers are increasingly expanding the scale of aggression. Wu Hsiu-chuan said in his speech that, during the period from August 27th to November 19th alone, the U.S. aggressors have violated Chinese airspace more than 150 times, bombing towns and villages in Northeast China.

Korionov pointed out: Taiwan Island is also one of the most important springboards for U.S. aggression against China. U.S. imperialists shamelessly disregard all standards of international law, violate the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, which state that Taiwan indisputably belongs to China, and carry out armed aggression against the island, thus constituting a direct act of aggression against independent and sovereign China. Vyshinsky's speech in the Political Committee and Wu Hsiu-chuan's speech in the Security Council have fully exposed the criminal policy of the U.S. government. The indisputable facts listed by the Soviet and Chinese representatives once again prove that the U.S. ruling clique is the enemy of the peace, freedom, and independence of all nations. After rejecting the peace-loving proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to immediately stop U.S. aggression against China and Korea, the U.S. ruling clique has further intensified its threats and blackmail against the great Chinese people. On November 29th, Acheson delivered a shameless radio speech. He openly threatened the people who defend peace with war and incited war hysteria. After Acheson's speech, Truman announced at a press conference in Washington on November 30th that the U.S. government intends to increase the size of the U.S. Army and continue its aggressive actions in Korea and against China.

Korionov concluded: Acheson's and Truman's crazy words once again prove that arrogant and conceited U.S. adventurers are unable to soberly assess the true balance of power in the world. They are unwilling to understand that they are now dealing with not a group of profiteering Chiang Kai-shek lackeys in China, but with 500 million people who are united in their determination to defend the peace, security, and integrity of their country, and who have a government that implements an independent and sovereign policy that conforms to the vital national interests of the Chinese people. Threatening words are not applicable to such people. All Chinese people unanimously support what Wu Hsiu-chuan said to Austin at the Security Council meeting—calm and powerful words: "Such threats cannot intimidate anyone."

    全中国人民拥护伍修权发言美帝威胁决吓不倒中国人民
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：真理报的国际评论家科里奥诺夫于十二月三日评论曾经讨论美国侵略中华人民共和国问题的联合国大会政治委员会与安全理事会的工作时写道：联合国中第一次响彻着真正的中国人民代表的声音，这个声音所代表的政府，其稳固与人民对它的拥护在中国历史上是无比的。
    中国代表伍修权在安全理事会中的演说，是对发动战争侵略中国及其他亚洲人民的美帝国主义的真正的控诉。中国代表根据无可辩驳的事实，证明了在很长的时间内美帝国主义者一直在对中国实行侵略政策。他们不遗余力地要完成对于中华人民共和国的军事包围，要把中国的各邻国变成直接对于中国实行军事进攻的跳板。所以美帝国主义进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的最重要的目的之一，就是要把朝鲜变为对中国实行军事侵略的桥头堡。
    美国战争贩子们利用为他们所占领的朝鲜区域，正在日益扩大侵略的规模。伍修权在演说中说到，仅仅在从八月二十七日到十一月十九日这一期间，美国侵略者已经侵犯中国领空一百五十次以上，轰炸了中国东北的城镇与乡村。
    科里奥诺夫指出：台湾岛也是美国侵略中国的最重要的跳板之一。美帝国主义者无耻地蔑视国际法的一切标准，破坏指明台湾无可争辩地属于中国的开罗协定与波茨坦宣言，实行对该岛的武装侵略，这样就构成了直接侵略独立自主的中国的行为。维辛斯基在政治委员会的演说和伍修权在安全理事会的演说已充分揭露了美国政府的罪恶的政策。苏联代表和中国代表所列举的无可置辩的事实又一次证明美国统治集团是各国人民的和平、自由与独立的敌人。美国统治集团在拒绝了苏联和中华人民共和国所提出规定立即停止美国对中国和朝鲜的侵略的爱好和平的提案之后，更进一步地加紧了对伟大的中国人民的威胁和敲诈。十一月二十九日艾奇逊发表了无耻的广播演说。他公开地用战争来威胁保卫和平的人民，煽动战争歇斯底里。在艾奇逊发表演说之后，杜鲁门十一月三十日在华盛顿记者招待会上宣布美国政府有意增加美国陆军的数量和继续其在朝鲜的和对中国的侵略行动。
    科里奥诺夫在结语中写道：艾奇逊和杜鲁门的疯狂的言辞又一次地证明傲慢自负的美国冒险家们是不能清醒地估计全世界真正的力量的对比的。他们不愿意了解：他们现在要在中国对付的不是一群唯利是图的蒋介石仆从们，而是五万万人民；这些人民已团结一致决心保卫其国家的和平、安全与完整，并且有着执行独立自主的符合中国人民的切身民族利益的政策的政府。威胁的言词对这种人民是不适用的。全中国人民一致拥护伍修权在安全理事会会议上对奥斯汀说的话——镇定而充满着力量的话：“这种威胁是吓不倒人的”。
