Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The declaration by church figures, church schools, church hospitals, and students returned from the U.S. in Beijing regarding Austin's shameless slanders is as follows:

    Austin, at the United Nations Security Council, distorted the facts and portrayed the United States' bloody aggression against China since 1835 as "friendship" towards the Chinese people. He shamelessly enumerated these facts of destroying China's cultural and educational sovereignty one by one. He not only slandered all cultural undertakings in our country supported by U.S. dollars and the staff working in church organizations, but also slandered and deceived all Americans who have goodwill and sympathy for the Chinese people, and blasphemed Christ, whom the American churches believe in. We believe that the peace-loving people of the United States have friendship towards the Chinese people, but the American imperialists and their pawns like Austin, who implement their aggressive policies against our motherland, are the enemies of the Chinese people. Therefore, we solemnly declare that we work in institutions that have received U.S. aid and in church organizations to serve our own people and our own country. We have friendship with the peace-loving people of the United States, but we certainly do not have "friendship" with warmongers like Austin. We are not slaves who can be utilized and bought by American imperialism and willingly endure slander. Our work is patriotic and for the Chinese people, and we support our government. We use this demonstration and parade to strike back at Austin's slanders and strengthen our determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. We call on all those who have been slandered by Austin across the country, all churches, church organizations, and students returned from the U.S. to stand with us on the same front and attack American imperialism. We want to awaken all Americans who have pure friendship towards the Chinese people and ask them to uphold justice with us, oppose aggression, and seek lasting world peace.

    Beijing Church Groups, Schools, Hospitals, and Students Returned from the U.S. Anti-Austin Slander Demonstration and Parade Assembly.

    北京市教会团体学校医院及留美学生
    宣言反对奥斯汀无耻谰言
    【新华社十三日讯】北京市教会人士、各教会学校、各教会医院及留美学生对奥斯汀无耻谰言的宣言，文如下：
    奥斯汀在联合国安全理事会上歪曲事实，把一八三五年以来美国对中国的血腥侵略，说成对中国人民的“友谊”。他把破坏中国文化教育主权的这一些事实，不打自招，一一列举。他不但污蔑了我国一切受美金支持的文化事业及在教会各机关的工作人员，也污蔑了并且蒙蔽了一切对于中国人民有好感有同情的美国人，并且亵渎了美国教会所信奉的基督。我们相信美国爱好和平的人民对中国人民具有友谊，但美帝国主义及其爪牙奥斯汀这一类的人，对我们祖国施行其侵略政策的人，却是中国人民的敌人。因此我们现在郑重声明，我们在曾经受过美援的机关中、在教会的各机关中作事，是为了我们自己的人民、自己的国家服务，我们和美国爱好和平的人民有友谊，而决不是和奥斯汀之流的战争贩子有“友谊”。我们不是美国帝国主义所能利用收买的、甘心忍受污蔑的奴才。我们的工作是爱国的，为中国人民的，我们拥护我们的政府。我们用这一次示威大游行来打击奥斯汀的谰言，并加强抗美援朝保家卫国的决意。我们号召全国各地方被奥斯汀所污蔑的人、各教会、各教会机关以及留美同学等，与我们站在一条阵线上向美帝国主义进攻。我们要唤醒一切对于中国人民抱有纯正友谊的美国人民，请他们和我们一同主持正义，反对侵略，谋求世界永久的和平。
    北京市教会团体学校医院及留美学生反奥斯汀污蔑示威大游行大会。
                                      一九五○年十二月十三日
