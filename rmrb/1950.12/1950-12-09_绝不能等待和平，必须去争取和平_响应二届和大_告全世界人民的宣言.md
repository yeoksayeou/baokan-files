    "We must not wait for peace, we must fight for peace. Let us work together to demand an end to the war that is ravaging Korea today and will plunge the whole world into flames tomorrow." This is the resounding and powerful call made in the "Declaration to the People of the World" by the Second World Peace Congress. The Chinese people warmly endorse this call and are determined to support and strive for its full realization with practical actions.

    The Second World Peace Congress was convened under the following circumstances: On the one hand, American imperialists have launched a war of aggression against Korea, occupied our Taiwan, bombed our Northeast, set the flames of war ablaze on our borders, and are preparing to expand this war of aggression to all of Asia and the world. On the other hand, 500 million people around the world have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, expressing their desire and determination to maintain peace, while the people of China, Korea, Vietnam, and other oppressed nations of the East have risen up to resist aggression and defend national independence and world peace with practical actions. The current international situation shows that the peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union and based on the strength of the Soviet Union and China, is engaged in an intense and fierce struggle with the imperialist aggression camp headed by the United States. Defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression are one and the same. The fate of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people around the world is inseparable from the fate of the entire world peace and democracy camp. The peace forces of the world must defeat the imperialist forces of aggression in order to escape the disaster of a new world war.

    The Second Peace Congress achieved great success. The forces fighting for peace have been greatly strengthened. The more than two thousand delegates attending the Congress, representing the broad masses of people of eighty countries with different political and religious beliefs, different races and skin colors, converged into a torrent, closely united around the banner of peace. The obstruction and sabotage of American and British imperialism have suffered a severe blow. The warmongers appear so small in the face of peace-loving people, proving that they absolutely cannot stop the upsurge of world people against aggression and defending peace. Representatives from various countries condemned the frantic acts of aggression by the American and British blocs against Korea, China, Vietnam, Malaya, and other nations. Imperialists have disrupted the peaceful lives of people in some countries and are still preparing to plunge all mankind into the disaster of war. The representatives all emphasized that peace-loving people in all countries of the world must not wait for peace, must not bow to imperialist aggression, and must not show the slightest hesitation or cowardice in the face of the threats and intimidation of the enemies of peace, but must unite strongly, rely on their own strength, and completely smash the enemy's war of aggression. The Soviet representative Fadeyev put it well: "Another world war is already knocking at the door. It is useless to guess whether the time when this war breaks down the door is near or far; practical measures must be taken to avoid war." As long as the people of all countries in the world jointly participate in the struggle to defend peace, they will certainly be able to defeat the murderous savages who attempt to engulf the world in war.

    The Chinese people can easily understand the appeal of the World Peace Congress. The experience of the Chinese people's resistance to imperialist oppression for more than a hundred years proves that only by resolutely打击 打擊 (dǎjī - strike; hit; attack)imperialism and smashing their various aggressive conspiracies can we ensure our own peace and security. Imperialists have always adopted two magic weapons in their aggression against other nations: deception and intimidation, and military offensives, which are the so-called "carrot and stick" that American monopoly capitalists' newspapers have recently been repeatedly promoting. The Japanese imperialists used these two magic weapons when they invaded China, and now the American imperialists have inherited their mantle. Under Truman's unified command, Acheson was responsible for deception and intimidation, while MacArthur carried out the task of military offense, the two closely cooperating and coordinating. Acheson used deceptive and intimidating tactics to cover MacArthur's military offensive, while MacArthur used military offense to increase Acheson's excuses and capital for deception and intimidation. The United States has adopted these two methods for its aggression against Korea and China. After the U.S. military landed at Incheon, Washington released information that the U.S. military would not cross the 38th parallel, attempting to paralyze the will of the Chinese and Korean people, weaken the resistance of the Korean people, and reduce the resistance to MacArthur. Under the cover of this smokescreen, MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel. At this time, the State Department immediately released a new smokescreen, claiming that the U.S. military would not cross the 40th parallel north latitude, while intimidating the Chinese people, saying that if the Chinese people aided the Korean people, they would "get into trouble." But then the U.S. military crossed the 40th parallel north latitude, approached the Chinese border, and increasingly increased the bombing of our Northeast. At this point, a senior official of MacArthur's headquarters openly denied that the Yalu River was the border between China and Korea, declaring: "Historically speaking, the Yalu River is not an obstacle that clearly separates the two countries," attempting to create a basis for the U.S. military to attack the Northeast. Almond, commander of the U.S. Tenth Corps, even more arrogantly said: "Where the enemy is, we will throw our forces there." Illustrations in an essay by Brigadier General Fellers, a psychological warfare officer at MacArthur's headquarters, published in the American Collier's magazine, clearly show three arrows shooting into the Chinese mainland. MacArthur planned to occupy all of Korea before Thanksgiving (i.e., November 23) in order to advance and attack China and Vietnam. Only because of the打击 打擊 (dǎjī - strike; hit; attack)of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army did his plan completely fail, and most of the Chinese people were able to live a peaceful life. The Chinese people fully recognize the face of imperialism, see through their tricks, and understand all their sweet words and beautiful language from the opposite side: when it says it will not do bad things, it means it will kill and set fire; when it shows a "friendly" face, it already has a knife in its hand; and when it loudly proclaims respect for our territorial sovereignty, we must quickly guard against its offensive. We must be vigilant against imperialism at all times, not be deceived by them, not be intimidated by their false声恫吓声恫吓 (xūshēng dònghè - empty threats), and resolutely resist their military aggression, so that they cannot achieve their treacherous plans.

    The Korean War has proven a truth: that American imperialism is a fierce and sinister wolf, it is greedy and insatiable, and only by breaking its claws and pulling out its teeth can its aggression be stopped. This wolf is so cruel that it burned countless Korean cities and villages to the ground; collectively shot thousands upon thousands of peaceful residents; stripped women naked for fun, gang-raped them to death, and treated three-year-old children as enemies. This wolf is so sinister that it ravaged the land and people of Korea, yet called it protecting "peace," "security," and "freedom"; its purpose in invading Korea was clearly to take Korea as a springboard to attack the Chinese mainland, yet it kept saying: "We have no territorial ambitions toward China." But this wolf is also so despicable and weak that when it gained a little advantage on the Korean battlefield, it became elated and aggressive, wishing it could immediately cross the Yalu River; and when it suffered some setbacks, it fled in panic, rolling around on the ground, screaming "it's terrible." The most recent such performance was after being打击 打擊 (dǎjī - strike; hit; attack)by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, when Truman, Acheson and the like put on a kind face, indicating that they were absolutely harmless; but later, when the U.S. military rushed to Hyesan-dong, opposite our Changbai County, MacArthur immediately proposed to establish a buffer zone on our territory on the north bank of the Yalu River. At this time, a Washington dispatch from the French news agency unconsciously revealed a truth: "One of the determining factors influencing the extent to which the US government's policy toward the Peking government is modified will be the strength shown by the Chinese army in the upcoming operations in Korea." The nature of American imperialism is no different from that of a wild wolf. It is bloodthirsty and insatiable. It will eat whatever it can get its mouth on, and its appetite will grow bigger and bigger. It is impossible to beg it to have mercy and not eat people or eat less people. If it sees it running away, it will chase after it relentlessly. If we let it eat Korea and Taiwan safely today, it will come to devour the Chinese mainland tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow it will spread the flames of war all over Asia and the world. The only way to deal with this wild wolf is for everyone to pick up sticks and beat it hard, beat it until it bleeds and makes it know that it cannot run wild everywhere, then it will retreat in the face of difficulties.

    Peace cannot be bestowed by others, it cannot rely on the good heart of imperialism, nor can it place all hope in the United Nations. As the General Assembly declaration says: "The people of the world must rely more on themselves, more on their own determination and goodwill." In the dictionary of imperialism, peace is synonymous with war. The United Nations has become a tool of American aggressive policy. In the United Nations, in addition to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries upholding justice and maintaining peace, some countries, although sometimes bickering with the United States due to their own interests, often follow the United States, and the rest of the countries follow the United States' orders. The United States is using the flag of the United Nations to invade Korea; the United States bombed our Northeast with planes, saying that this was a matter for the United Nations; the United States can instruct El Salvador to accuse China of "aggression" against its own territory of Tibet in the United Nations; the United States is manipulating the majority to refuse the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations. The Chinese people are concerned about the security of their own country and also about world peace. After the outbreak of the Korean War, China, like the Soviet Union, repeatedly advocated an early end to the war, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and a peaceful solution to the Korean issue by the Security Council, including representatives of the People's Republic of China, absorbing the Korean people to participate. Because China is a large country with 500 million people, important issues in the world, especially in Asia, are bound to be related to China, and Korea is China's close neighbor and is closely related to China, so the Chinese people naturally cannot help but ask about it. The period in history when China could be excluded from the international political stage is gone forever. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations rejected our request, and the United States transferred half of its existing army to the Korean battlefield, making the flames of war burn bigger and bigger. The Chinese people love peace and also know how to rely on their own strength to fight for peace. Therefore, they resolutely rose up and volunteered to aid the Korean people in resisting the American war of aggression.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend the Country shoulder a glorious and sacred historical mission. Their just actions are related to the fate of China, Korea, and all mankind, and are related to the development of world history. Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea means defending the country, and resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea and defending the country also means defending world peace. Peace is indivisible and the fate of mankind is the same. American imperialism is attempting to break through the peace line in Korea, then swallow China and sweep the world, placing mankind under their enslavement. We must打击 打擊 (dǎjī - strike; hit; attack)the aggressive ferocity of the United States in Korea, extinguish the wildfire ignited by the aggressors in Korea, so that it cannot spread to the world. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has already achieved an initial victory, eliminating more than 13,000 invaders and thwarting the enemy's aggressive plans. We believe that in the near future, even greater good news will be spread to the world. We, the people in the rear, must warmly support this Chinese People's Volunteer Army that is winning glory for the country. We must慰问 慰問 (wèiwèn - express sympathy, consolation, solicitude, etc.)the People's Volunteer Army, write letters to pay our respects to them, and give preferential treatment to the families of the Volunteer Army. We must do our jobs well in our respective positions, such as strengthening the national defense army and militia,剿灭 剿滅 (jiǎomiè - suppress; wipe out; exterminate)bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, implementing land reform, carrying out patriotic production competitions, developing cultural education, and holding people's representative conferences at all levels, etc. We must study current affairs, improve our awareness, and vow to be the backing of the Volunteer Army. All this is for a total goal: to defeat the American aggressors, defend the motherland, and defend world peace.

### 绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平  响应二届和大“告全世界人民的宣言”

    绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平
    响应二届和大“告全世界人民的宣言”
    陈克寒
    “绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平。让我们一致努力，要求停止今日蹂躏着朝鲜而明日势将把全世界投入火焰的战争。”这是第二届世界保卫和平大会“告全世界人民的宣言”中所提出的响亮有力的号召。中国人民热烈地拥护这个号召，并决以实际行动支持和争取这个号召的完全实现。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会是在这样的情势下召开的，就是：一方面，美国帝国主义者已经发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，占领了我国的台湾，轰炸了我国的东北，把战争火焰燃烧到我国边境，并正准备把这个侵略战争扩大到全亚洲和全世界；另一方面，世界上有五万万人民签名于斯德哥尔摩和平宣言，表示对于维护和平的愿望和决心，而中国、朝鲜、越南和东方各被压迫国家的人民，已奋起反抗侵略，用实际行动来保卫祖国独立和世界和平。当前的国际形势显示：以苏联为首并以苏联和中国两国的力量为基础的和平民主阵营，正和以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营进行着紧张剧烈的斗争。保卫世界和平和反对帝国主义侵略是一回事。苏联、各人民民主国家和世界爱好和平人民的命运和整个世界和平民主阵营的命运不可分离。世界人民的和平力量必须战胜帝国主义的侵略势力，才能摆脱新的世界大战的灾祸。
    二届和平大会获得了伟大的成就。为和平而斗争的力量大为增强。出席大会的二千多位代表，代表着八十个国家的不同的政治信仰和宗教信仰，不同的种族和肤色的广大人民，汇合成一股巨流，紧紧地团结在和平旗帜的周围。美英帝国主义的阻挠和破坏，遭受到严厉的打击。战争贩子在和平人民面前显得如此渺小，证明他们绝对无法遏止世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的高潮。与会各国代表纷纷斥责美英集团对于朝鲜、中国、越南、马来亚和其他民族的疯狂的侵略行为，帝国主义者已经破坏了一些国家人民的和平生活，而还在准备将全人类卷入到战争的灾难中去。代表们都强调地指出：世界各国的爱好和平人民，绝不能等待和平，决不要向帝国主义侵略势力低头，绝不在和平敌人的威胁恫吓面前表现丝毫的动摇和怯懦，而一定要坚强地团结起来，依靠自己的力量，彻底粉碎敌人的侵略战争。苏联代表法捷耶夫说得好：“另一次世界大战已经在撞着大门了。猜测这个战争撞开大门的时间是远还是近，那是没有用处的；必须采取实际措施来避免战争。”而只要世界各国人民共起参加保卫和平的斗争，就一定可以战胜企图以战争吞没世界的杀人生番。
    中国人民对于世界保卫和平大会的呼吁，是很容易了解的。中国人民一百多年以来反抗帝国主义压迫的经验证明：只有坚决地打击帝国主义，粉碎他们各种各样的侵略阴谋，才能保障自身的和平和安全。帝国主义者侵略其他民族，向来采取了欺骗恫吓和武力进攻两套法宝，也就是美国垄断资本家报纸最近所一再宣扬的所谓“恩威兼施”。以前日本帝国主义侵略中国采用的是这两套法宝，现在美国帝国主义者又承袭了它的衣钵。在杜鲁门的统一指挥之下，艾奇逊所担任的是欺骗恫吓，麦克阿瑟则执行了武力进攻的任务，两者密切配合，协同一致。艾奇逊用欺骗恫吓的手段，来掩护麦克阿瑟的武力进攻；而麦克阿瑟则以武力进攻来增加艾奇逊欺骗恫吓的借口和资本。美国对于朝鲜和中国的侵略，就采取了这两套办法。在美军登陆仁川以后，华盛顿方面放出了空气，说美军将不过三八线，企图借以麻痹中国人民和朝鲜人民的意志，削弱朝鲜人民的抵抗，减少对麦克阿瑟的阻力。在这种烟幕的掩护下，麦克阿瑟冲过了三八线。这时，国务院又立刻施放新的烟幕，扬言美军不越过北纬四十度，同时并恫吓中国人民说，中国人民如果援助朝鲜人民就会“惹祸上身”。但接着美军就越过北纬四十度，迫近中国边境，并日益增加对我东北的轰炸。到了这个时候，麦克阿瑟总部的一个高级官员公然否定鸭绿江是中朝两国的国界，宣称：“在历史上说来，鸭绿江并不是把两国截然分开的一道障碍”，企图为美军进攻东北制造根据。而美第十兵团司令阿尔梦德则更狂妄地说：“敌人在那里，我们就要把我们的兵力投在那里。”美国柯里尔杂志刊载的麦克阿瑟总部心理作战官员费勒斯准将论文的插图，有三支箭头明明白白地射入中国大陆。麦克阿瑟计划于感恩节（即十一月二十三日）前占领全部朝鲜，以便进而进攻中国和越南。只是由于受到中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的打击，他的计划完全破产，中国大部分人民才还能过着和平的生活。中国人民充分认识帝国主义的面貌，看透它们的这些把戏，对于它们的一切甘言美语都知道从反面去了解：它说不做坏事，就是要杀人放火；在它露出一脸“友好”时，手里已经握着刀子；而当它高嚷尊重我们的领土主权的时候，我们得赶紧提防它的进攻。我们必须对帝国主义时刻保持警戒，不受它们的欺骗，不为它们的虚声恫吓所慑服，并坚决反抗它们的武力侵略，使它们无法遂其奸计。
    朝鲜战争证明了一个真理，就是：美帝国主义是一只凶狠阴险的狼，它贪得无厌，得寸进尺，只有打断它的脚爪，拔掉它的牙齿，才能阻止它的侵略。这只狼是这样地凶残，它把朝鲜无数的城市和乡村焚毁为平地；把成千成万的和平居民集体枪杀；把妇女剥得光光的围观取乐，轮奸致死，把三岁儿童也当作敌人看待。这只狼是这样地阴险，它蹂躏朝鲜的土地和人民，却美其名曰保护“和平”、“安全”和“自由”；它侵略朝鲜的目的，明明是为了取得朝鲜作为跳板，进攻中国大陆，还口口声声地说：“对中国并无领土野心”。但这只狼又是这样地卑怯和虚弱，当它在朝鲜战场上稍一得势的时候，它就得意忘形，咄咄逼人，恨不得立时跨过鸭绿江；而当它遭受了一些挫折的时候，就抱头鼠窜，满地乱滚，大叫“不得了”。最近一次的这种表演是在受到中国人民志愿部队的打击以后，杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流装作和善的面孔，表示他是绝对无害的；但后来美军冲到了我长白县对面的惠山镇，麦克阿瑟便立刻提出要在鸭绿江北岸的我国领土上建立缓冲地带。这时，法国新闻社的华盛顿电讯不自觉地道出了一句真话，“影响美国政府对北平政府的政策修改到什么程度的决定因素之一将是中国军队在朝鲜的行将到来的作战中所表现的力量。”美国帝国主义的本性和野狼一般无二，它嗜血成性，欲壑无底，只要吃得到嘴的，它都要吃，而且胃口会越吃越大。哀求它大发慈悲，不吃人或少吃人，是办不到的。见了它逃跑，它就会紧追不舍。如果我们今天让它安安稳稳地吃掉朝鲜、台湾，它明天就要来吞噬中国大陆，后天更会把战火烧遍全亚洲、全世界。对待这只野狼的唯一办法，是大家拿起棍子来狠狠地打它，打得它头破血流，使它知道不是到处可以撒野的，那时它才会知难而退。
    和平不能由人恩赐，它不能仰赖帝国主义的善心，也不能把希望完全寄托于联合国。正如和大宣言所说的：“世界人民还须要更多地靠他们自己，更多地靠他们自己的决心和善意”。在帝国主义的字典里，和平是战争的代名词。联合国则已成为美国侵略政策的工具。在联合国里，除了苏联和人民民主国家坚持正义，维护和平以外，有一些国家虽因自身的利害关系有时和美国闹些小蹩扭，经常是追随美国的，其余的国家都是唯美国之命是从。美国用联合国的旗帜侵略朝鲜；美国用飞机轰炸了我国东北，说这是联合国的事；美国可以指使萨尔瓦多在联合国中控告中国“侵略”了中国自己的领土西藏；美国操纵多数拒绝中华人民共和国的合法的代表参加联合国。中国人民关切本国的安全，也关切世界和平。在朝鲜战争发生以后，中国和苏联一样，曾一再主张早日结束这场战争，外国军队自朝鲜撤退，由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的安理会，吸收朝鲜人民参加，和平解决朝鲜问题。因为中国是五万万人口的大国，世界的尤其是亚洲的重要问题一定关系中国，朝鲜是中国的紧邻，与中国休戚相关，中国人民自然不能不加过问。历史上可以排斥中国参加国际政治舞台的时期是一去不返了。但是联合国在美国操纵下拒绝了我们的要求，美国并把现有的半数陆军调到朝鲜战场上来，使战火越烧越大。中国人民是酷爱和平的，也懂得依靠自己的力量去争取和平。所以，便毅然决然地奋起，志愿援助朝鲜人民反抗美国的侵略战争。
    中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队担负了光荣神圣的历史使命。他们的正义行动关系中国、朝鲜和全人类的命运，关系世界历史的发展。抗美援朝即是保家卫国，而抗美援朝保家卫国也即保卫世界和平。和平是不可分割的，人类的命运是一致的。美国帝国主义企图在朝鲜突破和平战线，进而鲸吞中国，席卷全世界，把人类置于他们的奴役之下。我们一定要在朝鲜打击美国的侵略凶焰，扑灭侵略者在朝鲜所燃起的野火，使之不能蔓延到全世界。中国人民志愿部队已经获得了初战的胜利，消灭了一万三千多个侵略者，挫败了敌人的侵略计划，我们相信，在不久的将来，一定会有更大的捷报传告世人。我们在后方的人民必须热烈地支援这支为国争光的中国人民志愿部队。我们要慰问人民志愿部队，写信向他们致敬，并优待志愿军人的家属。我们要作好各自岗位上的工作，如加强国防军和民兵，剿灭土匪，镇压反革命活动，实行土地改革，开展爱国主义的生产竞赛，发展文化教育，开好各界人民代表会议等等。我们要学习时事，提高自己的觉悟，誓为志愿部队的后盾。这一切都是为着一个总的目标：打败美国侵略者，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
