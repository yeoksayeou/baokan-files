    Resolutely Banning Yiguandao
    On January 4, 1949, the former North China People's Government promulgated a proclamation banning feudal secret societies. Subsequently, people's governments in other parts of the country successively issued orders banning feudal secret societies. In the nearly two years since then, many reactionary leaders in various places have voluntarily registered with the People's Government and ceased illegal activities. However, some leaders have refused to register, gone underground, and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. The Northeast, Tianjin, Jinan, and Shanxi have severely struck against these reactionary leaders. The Beijing Municipal Government also arrested Wang Zhonglin and other leading culprits who continue to do evil on the 19th, and called on all leaders to register. At the same time, it encouraged a movement among followers to voluntarily withdraw from the sect. This is a necessary measure to maintain the security of the capital, protect production, and combat counter-revolutionary sabotage and counter-revolutionary rumors.
    Yiguandao is a counter-revolutionary tool controlled and used by imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit gang. It is a reactionary feudal superstitious organization, and an organization that deceives and harms backward masses. Its leading members are mostly traitors, spies, gangster bosses, reactionary landlords, and local bullies. They use this organization to deceive and extort followers, accumulating wealth for their own extravagance. Many leaders also rape female followers, causing many deceived followers to lose both their lives and property. More importantly, they carry out counter-revolutionary political sabotage activities, and even instigate and coerce backward masses to participate in armed rebellion. Based on the counter-revolutionary nature of Yiguandao, the People's Government has long established a policy of strict prohibition, in order to suppress a few of the most heinous elements and rescue the deceived followers. This policy has been implemented in various places and has achieved good results, and is unanimously supported by people from all walks of life.
    As far back as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yiguandao was used by Japanese invaders as a tool to invade our country, spreading "non-resistance" and defeatist sentiments, and deceiving the masses into becoming obedient subjects of the Japanese invaders. Many of them directly collected military intelligence for Japanese intelligence agencies, becoming effective assistants to Japanese spies. Its national leader, Zhang Guangbi, was an advisor to the Foreign Ministry of the traitor Wang Jingwei, and Chu Minyi, the puppet Executive Yuan President, was also a leading member of Yiguandao. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang bandit gang ordered Yiguandao to reorganize into the "China Moral Charity Association." From then on, Yiguandao was completely manipulated and used by Kuomintang spies. They spread rumors everywhere, sabotaged the People's Liberation War, sabotaged land reform, and instigated armed rebellions in the Northeast, Kaifeng, and other places. Jiang Pengfei's riot in Changchun is one example. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea by U.S. imperialism, they have been carrying out large-scale conspiracy activities. In some rural areas of North China, there are so-called "testicle cutting" rumors, which they fabricated and spread. It is particularly noteworthy that in recent years, Yiguandao has established close ties with several other reactionary secret societies, colluding with each other to expand counter-revolutionary activities. For example, Yiguandao in Tangyin County, Henan, joined forces with the Big Sword Society to coerce backward masses to participate in riots. Some leading members of Yiguandao secretly called on their followers to "not retreat," saying that "you cannot become a Buddha without being tested." They thought that by wearing a so-called "immortal Buddha" coat, they could secretly deceive and control their followers forever. However, since the People's Government has the power and determination to eliminate all reactionary organizations, the stubborn persistence of a few Yiguandao leaders can only lead to their own destruction. In the past, the People's Governments of Northeast China and other places have dealt a devastating blow to Yiguandao. Now, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has registered and arrested the leading members of Yiguandao. This should be a strong warning to those stubborn leaders.
    The policy of the People's Government to resolutely ban Yiguandao is definite and clear. All leading members of reactionary secret societies must register. The People's Government hopes that they will repent, thoroughly correct their past mistakes, and cease all illegal activities. If they resist registration and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, the People's Government will severely punish them. As for the deceived ordinary followers, they have suffered extortion and oppression, and some have been bankrupted as a result, becoming victims of a few Yiguandao leaders. They support the government's ban on Yiguandao, because the government's policy of banning secret societies is completely in line with their interests. However, some of them have been deeply poisoned ideologically because they have been deceived and used by counter-revolutionary elements for a long time, and they do not yet understand the policies of the People's Government, showing confusion and anxiety. For these ordinary followers, the laws of the People's Government stipulate that as long as they break away from the reactionary organization and cease illegal activities, they will not be held accountable. Anyone who can sever all ties with counter-revolutionary elements, get rid of all threats, bravely accuse the reactionary leaders who have poisoned them, expose the secret agents who wear the "immortal Buddha" coat, and expose their various conspiracies, thereby assisting the government in the work of eliminating Yiguandao, will be rewarded by the government. Ordinary followers should clearly recognize this policy of the People's Government and actively launch a voluntary withdrawal movement. Now, in Shanxi Province alone, 80,000 followers have voluntarily withdrawn from the sect. The People's Government does not hold these voluntarily withdrawing followers accountable for the past, and expresses commendation for their repentance and self-help actions.
    It is estimated that some reactionary leaders will continue to use various methods to oppose the people. For example, after the People's Government ordered the ban on Yiguandao, they changed the name of Yiguandao and continued their activities. The names that have been discovered now include Tiandao, Kongmengdao, Zhendao, Zhenshandao, Xiantian Dao, Shengxiandao, Erguandao, Kongmingdao, Xinlidao, Baiyangdao, Tiangongdao, Shengxiandao, etc. This kind of renaming has been found in as many as eighteen kinds in Shanxi Province alone. Therefore, every Yiguandao follower, as well as all members of reactionary secret societies, should understand that the policy of the People's Government is to ban all reactionary secret societies. Any renamed organization of reactionary secret societies is illegal. Everyone should be vigilant and refuse to participate in any feudal secret societies, lest they be deceived again and again, and should be determined to jump out of this reactionary pit forever.
    We hope that people from all walks of life, as well as all enlightened followers, will actively assist the People's Government in banning Yiguandao and other reactionary secret society organizations, in order to protect revolutionary order and save the deceived followers from the trap. This is an important task in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 坚决取缔一贯道

    坚决取缔一贯道
    一九四九年一月四日，前华北人民政府曾颁布取缔封建会门的布告。接着全国其他地区人民政府也都相继发表了取缔封建会门的命令。在这将近两年的时日里，各地已有不少反动道首向人民政府自动进行了登记，停止了非法活动；但仍有一部分道首拒不登记，转入秘密，继续进行反革命活动。对于这些反动道首，东北、天津、济南、山西已予以沉重打击，北京市亦于十九日逮捕了王钟麟等继续作恶的首要分子，并号召所有道首进行登记，同时，鼓励道徒中自动退道的运动。这是维护首都治安，保护生产，打击反革命破坏活动和反革命谣言的必要措施。
    一贯道是被帝国主义与国民党匪帮所掌握与利用的反革命工具，是反动的封建迷信的组织，是欺骗与陷害落后群众的组织。其首要分子，多是汉奸、特务、流氓头子、反动地主、恶霸之流。他们利用这一组织，一方面欺骗勒许道徒，敛聚财物，以供自己挥霍；有不少道首，并奸污入道妇女，使不少受骗道徒人死财空。更主要的是他们进行反革命的政治破坏活动，甚至策动胁迫落后群众参加武装叛乱。基于一贯道的这种反革命性质，人民政府早就确定了严厉取缔的政策，借以镇压少数首恶分子，并挽救受骗道徒。这一政策已在各地实施，而且已经收到良好的效果，为各界人民所一致拥护。
    远在抗日战争期间，一贯道即被日寇利用为侵略我国的工具，散布“不抵抗主义”与失败情绪，愚弄群众作日寇的顺民，他们有许多更直接为日本特务机关搜集军事情报，成为日本特务的得力助手。其全国首领张光璧，则是汉奸汪精卫的外交部顾问，伪行政院长褚民谊亦是一贯道的首要分子。抗战胜利后，国民党匪帮命令一贯道改组为“中华道德慈善会”。从此，一贯道即完全为国民党特务所操纵利用。他们到处散播谣言，破坏人民解放战争，破坏土地改革，并在东北、开封等地策动武装叛乱。姜鹏飞在长春的暴乱就是其中一个例子。自美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争爆发后，他们又大肆阴谋活动。在华北一部分农村中有所谓“割蛋”的谣言，就是他们捏造和散布的。特别值得注意的是：近年以来，一贯道又和若干其他反动会门建立了密切联系，互相勾结，扩大进行反革命活动。例如河南汤阴县的一贯道即曾联合大刀会，胁迫落后群众参加骚乱。一贯道的若干首要分子，秘密地号召其徒众“不可退缩”，说什么“不考不成佛”。他们以为披着一件所谓“仙佛”外衣，就可以永远秘密地欺骗与控制其道徒。然而，人民政府既然有力量有决心肃清一切反动组织，少数一贯道头子的顽固执迷，就只能是自寻绝路。过去，东北等地的人民政府已予一贯道以毁灭性打击，现在，北京市人民政府又登记与逮捕了一贯道的首要分子，这对于那些顽固执迷的道首，应该是一个有力的警告。
    人民政府坚决取缔一贯道的政策，是肯定而明确的。凡属反动会道门的首要分子均须进行登记，人民政府希望他们翻然悔悟，痛改前非，停止一切非法活动。如果他们抗拒登记，继续进行反革命活动，人民政府即予以严厉惩处。至于受骗的一般道徒，他们曾饱受勒诈欺压，部分人已因此倾家荡产，成为少数一贯道头子的牺牲品，他们是拥护政府取缔一贯道的，因为政府取缔会道门的政策，与他们的利益完全一致。但是，其中有一部分人，因为久受反革命分子的欺骗与利用，思想上中了很深的毒害，暂时还不了解人民政府的政策，表现着迷惘与不安。对于这一般道徒，人民政府的法令规定，只要他们脱离反动组织，停止非法活动，就不加追究。凡能斩断与反革命分子的一切联系，摆脱一切威胁，勇敢地控诉毒害自己的反动道首，检举披着“仙佛”外衣的特务分子，揭发其各种奸谋，因而协助政府进行了肃清一贯道这一工作的，当受到政府的奖励。一般道徒都应该清醒地认识人民政府这一政策，积极展开自动退道运动。现在，仅山西一省即已有八万道徒自动退道，人民政府对于这些自动退道的道徒，一律不究既往，并且对于他们这种悔悟自救的行动，表示嘉许。
    估计到若干反动道首还会利用各种方法继续与人民为敌。例如当人民政府下令取缔一贯道之后，他们就把一贯道的名目改换一下，继续活动。现在已发现的名称有天道、孔孟道、真道、真善道、先天道、圣贤道、二贯道、孔明道、信理道、白杨道、天宫道、圣仙道等。这种化名，仅在山西一省即已发现有十八种之多。因此，每一个一贯道徒，以及一切反动会门的会众，都应该明了，人民政府的政策是取缔一切反动会道门的，任何反动会门的化名组织，都是非法的，大家应当提高警惕，拒绝参加一切封建会道门，免致一再上当，而应决心使自己永远跳出这个反动火坑。
    我们希望各界人民以及一切觉悟了的道徒会众，积极协助人民政府取缔一贯道及其他反动会道门组织，以保护革命秩序，并挽救受骗的会道徒跳出陷阱。这是巩固人民民主专政的一个重要的工作。
