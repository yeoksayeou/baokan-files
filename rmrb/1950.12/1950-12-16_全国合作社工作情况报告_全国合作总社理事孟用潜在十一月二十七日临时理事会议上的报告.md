The National Cooperative Conference was held almost four months ago. Here is a brief report on the work of cooperatives nationwide during this period:

(I)
The reports on the situation of cooperatives in various regions at the National Cooperative Conference were based on materials compiled at the end of March. Recent materials collected from various regions up to the end of September show that cooperatives continued to develop in the second and third quarters of 1950. The number of grassroots cooperatives in urban and rural areas increased from 38,000 to 45,000, an increase of 18 percent. The number of members increased from 20 million to 25.12 million, an increase of 25 percent. The Northeast now has 9.82 million members, North China has 8.24 million, East China has 5.59 million, and Inner Mongolia, Northwest, and Central South each have 400,000 to 500,000 members. Member share capital increased from 239.7 billion yuan to 273.4 billion yuan (RMB), an increase of 14 percent. As of September this year, state and local governments have allocated a total of 300.3 billion yuan to cooperatives. Accumulated cooperative surpluses and non-refundable income total 264.3 billion yuan. In total, the current total capital of cooperatives is approximately 840.7 billion yuan. The total retail and procurement volume of cooperatives in the Northeast for nine months was 2,574.8 billion yuan. The total supply and marketing volume in the first half of the year exceeded 1.2 times that of the entire year of 1949, equivalent to 74 percent of the total procurement and sales volume of state-owned commerce in the Northeast region. Among them, the procurement volume was about 78 percent of the procurement volume of state-owned commerce, and the retail volume was about 72 percent of the sales volume of state-owned commerce. The retail volume in North China in the third quarter of this year is estimated at 175.3 billion yuan, and the procurement volume is estimated at 83.5 billion yuan, with a total supply and marketing volume of 258.8 billion yuan. There are no complete statistics for business in other regions.

(II)
After the closing of the National Cooperative Conference, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government circulated the main conclusions of the conference to the financial committees of various regions, which aroused the attention of various regions to the work of cooperatives. In September and October, major regions and provinces and cities such as North China, Northeast, East China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest successively convened cooperative conferences in various regions in conjunction with rectification movements. Central South and Southwest are also holding meetings. At the meetings, the main contents of the National Cooperative Conference were conveyed, past work was reviewed, the policy of concentrating all efforts to meet the needs of members and the superior cooperatives serving the subordinate cooperatives was emphasized, the steps and methods for putting the cooperatives on the right track were studied and stipulated, and the business work of the cooperatives this autumn and winter was specifically arranged. In new areas, such as Central South, it was proposed that today we must focus on starting work in a planned manner with prudent steps. Under certain leadership and with group organizing cadres, we should focus on trial implementation, doing a good job of each one, gradually promoting it, and establishing the necessary foundation for the great development of cooperative undertakings in the future.

In the review work in various places, on the one hand, it was stated that cooperatives have developed, progressed, and transformed. On the other hand, the shortcomings of the current work were also pointed out, the most basic and main of which is that the business operations of the cooperatives are not entirely from the perspective of the members, but are often busy with the activities of stores and free markets. In fact, cooperatives must and can adopt a completely different business policy from ordinary merchants. Because it has fixed and organized customers. This makes it possible for cooperatives to investigate and collect statistics on the needs of members and to plan and organize their own business.

Today, what actually determines the nature of the cooperative and the relationship between the cooperative and its members are three very specific issues: commodities, profits, and prices. As long as the cooperative starts from the members, purchases and sells goods according to the needs of the members, as long as it can calculate carefully, reduce the links in commodity circulation, speed up turnover, save expenses, reduce losses, and specifically stipulate its own profit rate on the basis of reasonable capital accumulation, it can correctly grasp the price policy of the cooperative and distribute or purchase the same commodity at a uniformly stipulated price in the same region. This will enable members to obtain material benefits and show that the cooperative is indeed different from ordinary capitalist commercial operations.

However, there is still a kind of capitalist business thinking and capitalist business method brought from the old society that is contrary to this in the cooperative system today, which does not purchase and sell goods according to the needs of the members, but starts solely from the size of the profit. According to the results of recent inspection work, many county and city cooperatives do not purchase goods according to the needs of the members, but open their own stores and are busy with market activities. In August, the counties of Tianjin Prefecture traded with members at most 36 percent, and some counties did not trade with members at all. The average gross profit rate of the general cooperatives of the five provinces and two cities in North China in the first half of the year was 14.4 percent, and the average gross profit rate of the four county cooperatives in Shunyi, Jianguo, Dingxian, and Wu'an in Hebei Province was 14.4 percent. Wu'an's gross profit rate was 18 percent, and the gross profit of several commodities was even higher, such as wheat at 34 percent, peach kernels at 52 percent, and pepper at 45 percent. This pursuit of profit seriously affects the relationship between cooperatives and between cooperatives and members, forming a phenomenon of mutual disconnection. Such cooperatives are often strongly run by officials, and cadres also regard themselves as being run by officials, preserving a set of bureaucratic styles, and cases of corruption, theft, and arrears continue to occur.

As a result of such operations, cooperatives are little different from private merchants, or even no different. To put cooperatives on the right track today, we must "concentrate all efforts to meet the needs of members" and implement the policy of "superior cooperatives serving subordinate cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives serving members," and this issue must be resolved ideologically and professionally. That is to say, cooperatives must rely on their own customers, investigate and collect statistics on the needs of members, operate business according to a certain plan, and specifically stipulate the wholesale and retail prices of cooperatives and the profit rate of cooperatives at all levels on the basis of economic accounting. These are the main links to put cooperatives on the right track and realize democratic management. The cooperative's policy of serving members is the policy of serving the masses. There can be no other interpretation.

(III)
At present, various regions are carrying out key rectification of cooperatives, and there is not much experience. The more successful one is Beijing.

After reviewing its own capitalist business thinking, the Beijing General Cooperative resolutely abolished store retail and market wholesale, faced the members, and concentrated all its efforts to serve the grassroots cooperatives. The retail task was handed over to the grassroots cooperatives. From August to October, non-member trade accounted for only 4.3 percent of the total sales, and mainly the supply of oil and salt to organs and troops and the disposal of some old grain and unpopular goods. After the General Cooperative abolished transactions with non-members and turned its work to the grassroots cooperatives, the sales volume not only did not decrease, but increased month by month, from 11.3 billion to 15.3 billion, an increase of 30 percent. The number of commodities operated decreased from 1,031 to 700, and recently 200 unnecessary varieties and too many brands of commodities will be reduced. In this way, the capital strength is concentrated on the main commodities needed by members, and 65 trade cadres are saved to strengthen the work of procurement, transportation, and accounting departments; at the same time, the relationship between the grassroots cooperatives and the General Cooperative is closely consolidated.

In implementing this transformation, the basic links grasped by the Beijing General Cooperative are: (1) Investigate and understand the needs of members, purchase goods according to the needs of members, and implement planned quantitative distribution of several main necessities. (2) According to the cost calculation table of each commodity, stipulate the wholesale price and retail price of the General Cooperative to the grassroots cooperatives; the prices of distributed goods are unified and personally controlled by the responsible comrades of the General Cooperative. (3) Specifically stipulate the profit rate of the cooperative, the net profit of the General Cooperative does not exceed 2 percent, and the gross profit of the grassroots cooperative does not exceed 7 percent. (4) Dispatch funds according to the procurement and retail plan, and dispatch transportation according to the distribution plan. In this way, by specifically controlling prices on the basis of rationalizing operations, reducing waste and losses, reducing costs, and limiting profit rates, members can indeed get affordable and high-quality benefits.

In this way, the Beijing General Cooperative purchases kerosene from Tianjin, directly transports it without warehousing, and distributes it directly to the members of the rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs. The currency can be recovered within seven days. The market price of kerosene is 8,000 yuan per catty, and the cooperative sells it for 6,200 yuan, which is 22.5 percent lower than the market price. Salt is directly purchased from the salt flats, the cost is 881 yuan per catty, and it is sold to members at 950 yuan, which is 15 percent lower than the market price.

After the implementation of quantitative distribution, members get direct benefits, those who wanted to withdraw their shares do not withdraw, and those who have withdrawn their shares request to rejoin. The "honorary members" who joined the shares but did not pay the shares in Gou Nihe Village also actively paid the shares. From late October to mid-November, 4,598 new members were added in the suburbs, accounting for 60 percent of the original members of the rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs.

This transformation educates the members on the one hand, and educates the cadres of the cooperative on the other hand. At the same time, the entire work has also taken a big step forward due to the strengthening of careful calculation and planning. We believe that the several links grasped by the Beijing General Cooperative in implementing this transformation are correct and are a more successful experience in putting cooperatives on the right track.

(IV)
The main work done by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives during this period is: (1) Solving the relationship between cooperatives and the state-owned economy, (2) Assisting and organizing the exchange of materials between major administrative regions from a business perspective, and formulating the annual and first-quarter plans for 1950, (3) Preparing to establish a unified national accounting system, financial system, and unified statistical reporting system. The following is a breakdown:

1. The National Cooperative Conference pointed out that "in order to put cooperatives on the right track and continue to develop, it is necessary to obtain preferential treatment from the state." At the conference, several principles and opinions on the state's economic preferential treatment of cooperatives were also put forward. After the meeting, the results of consultations with the Ministry of Trade, the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications are as follows: (1) A draft "Decision on the Relationship between State-owned Trade and Cooperatives" was jointly drafted with the Ministry of Trade and has been submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for review. (2) The "Decision on State Banks Supporting Cooperatives" has been promulgated and implemented by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council. In addition, the "Opinions on Preparing for the Establishment of an Agricultural Cooperative Bank" jointly proposed with the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Agriculture are being reviewed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council. (3) Regarding the cooperative tax payment method, an instruction was jointly issued by the State Taxation Bureau and the Central Cooperative Enterprise Administration, which has caused a lot of feedback from cooperatives in various regions, and is currently being discussed and revised with the State Taxation Bureau. (4) The issues of railway freight, telegram, and long-distance telephone preferential treatment have not been resolved so far due to various reasons.

2. In terms of business, the National Federation of Cooperatives is implementing and preparing to carry out the following tasks: (1) A contract has been signed with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade to collect 50 million catties of lint cotton in North China, and the contract to purchase 30 million catties of lint cotton on behalf of the Ministry of Trade has not been formally signed. The general contract has not been signed, but some state-owned cotton and cloth companies in some regions have signed local contracts with local cooperatives to carry out the purchase. (2) A contract has been signed with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade to collect 26 million to 50 million catties of peanut fruit and 159 million to 328 million catties of peanut kernels in Pingyuan, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. (3) Organize the exchange of materials between cooperatives in the three major administrative regions of Northeast, North China, and East China. From late November 1950 to the end of June 1951, the Northeast will transport and sell 100,000 tons of soybean cake, 100,000 tons of soybeans, and 100,000 tons of red sorghum and corn to supply North China and East China to cooperate with the spring plowing in 1951. At the same time, East China and North China will transport and sell 2 million catties of lint cotton and 600,000 bolts of cloth in exchange for the surplus grain purchased by members in the Northeast. (4) Prepare to pilot key distribution in the first quarter of next year, select several employee members in the city as the target, and distribute grain, coal, and salt. In the countryside, select key members of several supply and marketing cooperatives to distribute several daily necessities such as cloth, coal, and salt. It is estimated that the distribution amount in the first quarter will be 260 billion yuan, requiring a turnover of about 50 billion yuan. This distribution work may have a good effect on promoting cooperatives to get on the right track. (5) In the current situation where rural native products are滞销 and the Ministry of Trade cannot purchase them in large quantities, we are preparing to purchase 100 million catties of grain, 12 million catties of cotton, and more than 20 kinds of native products that can be exported from the members of the rural supply and marketing cooperatives on credit, which will be gradually returned by the Ministry of Trade in kind in the future. The Ministry of Trade is preparing to exchange about 500,000 bags of flour, 480,000 dan of salt, 310,000 tons of coal, 4 million packages of matches, 5 million pieces of soap, 6.4 million catties of alkali noodles, 2 million catties of sugar, and 100,000 bolts of cloth. The business of this credit purchase and exchange is being specifically discussed. (6) Regarding the work for next year, a "Preliminary Draft Plan for the Development of Cooperatives in 1951" has been formulated, which estimates that the number of grassroots cooperatives nationwide can be developed to 63,138 by the end of 1950, an increase of 31 percent compared with the end of 1950; the number of members will be developed to 46.18 million, an increase of 55 percent; the share capital will be expanded to 624 billion yuan, an increase of 92 percent; the total retail volume of the three major regions will be 7005.09 billion yuan, and the total purchase volume will be 78,366 billion yuan, totaling 148,875 billion yuan.

3. A national cooperative financial accounting meeting was recently held, and on the basis of first clearing the capital and property, we are preparing to unify the national cooperative accounting and financial system. At the same time, we are preparing to hold a national statistical planning meeting at the end of this year or early next year in order to unify the national cooperative statistical reporting and planning work. These are some of the basic tasks that the All-China Federation of Cooperatives must carry out in terms of business and system in order to implement the policy of unified leadership decided by the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference.

The above is the work report we have submitted to the first meeting of the provisional council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for review.

    全国合作社工作情况报告            
    ——全国合作总社理事孟用潜在十一月二十七日临时理事会议上的报告
    从全国合作社工作者代表会议到现在已将近四个月，兹将最近这一期间全国合作社的工作情况简要报告如下：
    （一）
    全国合作会议时，关于各地合作社情况的报告是根据三月底的材料整理的。最近汇集各地截至九月底的材料，说明合作社在一九五○年第二和第三季度续有发展。城市和乡村的基层社已由三万八千社增至四万五千社，增加百分之十八。社员由两千万人增至二千五百一十二万人，增加百分之二十五。东北现有九百八十二万社员，华北八百二十四万社员，华东五百五十九万社员，内蒙、西北、中南各四十至五十万社员。社员股金由二千三百九十七亿元增至二千七百三十四亿元（人民币，下同），增加百分之十四。截至本年九月，国家及地方政府对合作社拨款共计三千零三十亿元。合作社盈余累积及不返还收入共计二千六百四十三亿元。总计以上各项，目前合作社资金总额约计为八千四百零七亿元。东北合作社九个月的零售和采购总额共计二万五千七百四十八亿元，其上半年供销总额已超过一九四九全年的一点二倍，相当于国营商业在东北区内全部采购与推销总额的百分之七十四，其中采购额约相当于国营商业采购额的百分之七十八，零售额则相当于国营商业推销额的百分之七十二。华北本年第三季度零售约计为一千七百五十三亿元，采购约计为八百三十五亿元，其供销总额共计二千五百八十八亿元。其他各区的业务无完整统计。
    （二）
    全国合作会议闭幕后，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会将会议主要结论通报各地财委会，引起了各地对合作社工作的重视。九、十月间，华北、东北、华东、内蒙、西北各大区及省、市合作总社结合着整风，先后召开了各地区的合作会议，中南、西南现在也正在召开会议。各地在会议上都传达了全国合作会议的主要内容，检讨了过去的工作，强调了集中全力满足社员需要和上级社为下级社服务的方针，研究和规定了使合作社走上正轨的步骤和办法，并具体布置了合作社今年秋冬的业务工作。在新区，如中南，则提出今天必须有重点地，有计划地采取慎重的步骤开始工作，在有一定的领导及组社干部条件下，重点试办，办好一个顶一个，逐步推动，并为今后合作事业大发展建立必要的基础。
    各地在检讨工作中，一方面说明合作社有发展、有进步、有转变。另一方面也指出了目前工作的缺点，其中最基本和最主要的就是合作社的业务经营并不完全是从社员出发，而往往忙于门市和自由市场的活动。实际上合作社必须并且可以采取与普通商人完全不同的方针经营业务。因为它有固定的而且是有组织的主顾。这样就使合作社有可能调查统计社员的需要，能计划和组织自己的业务。
    今天实际决定着合作社性质，决定着合作社与社员之间的关系的是很具体的三个问题，就是商品，利润与价格。合作社只要从社员出发，根据社员需要进销货物，只要它能精打细算，减少商品流通环节，加速周转，节约开支，降低损耗，并且在合理的资本积累的基础上具体规定自己的利润率，它便可以正确掌握合作社的价格政策，同一商品在同一地区按统一规定的价格配售或收购。这样就可以使社员得到物质的实惠，显示出合作社与普通的资本主义的商业经营确实有所不同。
    但今天在合作社系统内还存在着一种从旧社会带来的，与这相对立的，不根据社员需要进销货物，而单从利润大小出发的资本主义经营思想和资本主义的经营方式。根据最近检查工作的结果，不少地区的县市社都是不根据社员需要采购货物，而自行开设门市部，忙于市场活动。天津专区各县社八月份对社员交易最多的是百分之三十六，有的县甚至没有与社员交易。华北五省二市总社上半年平均毛利率为百分之十四点四，河北省顺义、建国、定县、武安四个县社的平均毛利率为百分之十四点四。武安毛利率是百分之十八，有几种商品的毛利则更高，如小麦为百分之三十四，桃仁为百分之五十二，花椒为百分之四十五。这种追逐利润的情况就严重地影响着合作社之间和合作社与社员的关系，形成相互脱节的现象。这种合作社往往是官办劲大，在干部思想上也以官办自居，保存着一套机关化的作风，贪污腐化偷盗赊欠的案件也不断发生。
    这样经营的结果，就使合作社与私商很少区别，甚至毫无区别。今天要使合作社走上正轨，就必须“集中全力满足社员需要”，贯彻“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的方针，而且必须从思想上和业务上，来解决这一问题。这就是说，合作社必须依靠自己的主顾，调查统计社员的需要，按照一定的计划经营业务，并在经济核算的基础上具体规定合作社的批发零售价格和各级合作社的利润率。这就是目前使合作社走上正轨，实现民主管理的几个主要环节。合作社为社员服务的方针，即是为群众服务的方针。此外，不能有任何其他解释。
    （三）
    目前各地正在进行重点整社，经验还不多，其中比较成功的是北京市。
    北京市总社在检讨了自己的资本主义经营思想之后，坚决取消了门市零售和市场批发，面向社员，集中全力为基层社服务。零售任务交给基层社去作。八至十月，非社员贸易只占总销货额的百分之四点三，而且主要是对机关部队的油盐供应和一部分旧粮食和冷背货的处理。总社在取消向非社员交易，把工作面向基层社之后，销货额不但没有减少，而且逐月上升，已由一百一十三亿增至一百五十三亿，增加百分之三十。经营的商品则由一千零三十一种减少到七百种，最近还要减少不必需的种类和牌号太杂的商品二百种。这样便将资金力量集中到社员必需的主要商品上去，并且节省下来六十五个贸易干部，加强了采购、运输和核算部门的工作；同时也密切巩固了基层社对总社的关系。
    在执行这一转变中，北京市总社所掌握的几个基本环节是：（一）调查了解社员需要，根据社员需要采购货物，实行几种主要必需品的有计划的定量配售。（二）根据每种商品的成本计算表，规定总社对基层社的批发价和零售价；配售物品，价格统一并由总社负责同志亲自掌握。（三）具体规定合作社的利润率，总社纯利不超过百分之二，基层社毛利不超过百分之七。（四）根据采购和零售计划调度资金，根据分配计划调度运输。这样在经营合理化，减少浪费损耗，降低成本和限制利润率的基础上具体掌握价格，便使社员确实得到物美价廉的实惠。
    这样北京市总社从天津买煤油，直接调运，不倒仓，一直分配到郊区农村供销社社员，货币七天之内即可回笼，煤油市价每斤八千元，合作社卖六千二，比市价低百分之二十二点五。盐由盐滩直接进货，成本每斤八百八十一元，按九百五十元卖给社员，比市价低百分之十五。
    实行定量配售之后，社员得到直接利益，想退股的不退了，已经退了股的要求重新入社，入了股没有交股金的“名誉社员”也积极主动的将股金交齐。沟泥河村在配售中补交股金的有二百七十一人。从十月下旬到十一月中旬郊区新增加社员四千五百九十八人，占郊区原有农村供销社社员的百分之六十。
    这一转变一方面教育了社员，另一方面也教育了合作社的干部。同时整个工作由于精打细算和计划性的加强，也向上提高了一大步。我们认为北京市总社在执行这一转变中所掌握的几个环节是正确的，是目前使合作社转入正轨比较成功的经验。
    （四）
    全国合作总社在这一期间所做的工作主要是：（一）解决合作社与国营经济的关系，（二）从业务上帮助与组织各大行政区之间的物资交换，拟订一九五○年全年的和第一季度的计划，（三）准备建立全国统一的会计制度，财务制度和统一的统计表报制度。兹分述如下：
    一、全国合作会议曾指出“为了使合作社走上正轨并继续发展，从国家方面取得优待是必要的”，当时在会议上并且提出了国家经济优待合作社的几项原则意见。会议之后与贸易部、人民银行、财政部、铁道部、邮电部分别商洽的结果如下：（一）与贸易部共同起草了一个“关于国营贸易与合作社的关系决定”草案，已送请政务院财政经济委员会审核。（二）“国家银行扶助合作社的决定”已由政务院财政经济委员会公布施行。另外与人民银行、农业部共同提出的“关于筹设农业合作银行的意见”则正由政务院财政经济委员会审查中。（三）关于合作社纳税办法，曾由税务总局与中央合作事业管理局共同签发指示一件，各地合作社反映颇多，现正与税务总局商洽修订。（四）铁路运费、电报及长途电话优待问题则因种种原因，至今尚未解决。
    二、在业务方面全国总社正在执行和准备进行以下几项工作：（一）已与财政部、贸易部签订合同，在华北，代征皮棉五千万斤，代贸易部收购皮棉三千万斤的合同尚未正式签订，总合同未签订，但若干地区国营花纱布公司与当地合作社则已签订地方合同，进行收购。（二）已与财政部、贸易部签订合同，在平原、河北、山东、河南代征花生果二千六百万至五千万斤，代征花生仁一亿五千九百万至三亿二千八百万斤。（三）组织东北、华北、华东三大行政区合作社的物资交换，自一九五○年十一月下旬至一九五一年六月底，由东北运销豆饼十万吨，大豆十万吨，红粱、玉米十万吨，供给华北、华东，配合一九五一年春耕。同时由华东、华北运销皮棉二百万斤、布六十万匹，换取东北收购的社员余粮。（四）准备明年第一季度试办重点配售，在城市选择若干职工社员为对象，配售粮，煤、盐，在乡村选择重点向若干供销社社员配售布、煤、盐等几种日用品。预计第一季度配售额为二千六百亿元，约需周转资金五百亿。这种配售工作对促使合作社走上正轨可能发生很好的作用。（五）在目前农村土产滞销，而贸易部又不能大量收购的情况下，准备向农村供销社社员赊购粮食一亿斤，棉花一千二百万斤和二十余种可以出口的土产，将来由贸易部陆续用实物归还。贸易部准备用以交换的约计为面粉五十万袋、盐四十八万担、煤三十一万吨、火柴四百万包、肥皂五百万块、碱面六百四十万斤、糖二百万斤、布十万匹。此项赊购交换的业务正在具体磋商中。（六）关于明年度的工作，现已拟订一个“一九五一年合作社发展初步计划草案”，预计明年全国基层社可发展至六万三千一百三十八社，比一九五○年底增加百分之三十一；社员发展至四千六百一十八万人，增加百分之五十五；股金扩大至六千二百四十亿元，增加百分之九十二；三大区的零售总额七万零五百零九亿元，收购总额七万八千三百六十六亿元，合计一十四万八千八百七十五亿元。
    三、最近召开了一次全国合作社财务会计会议，在首先清理资金财产的基础上，准备统一全国合作社的会计和财务制度，同时准备在今年底，或明年初召开一次全国统计计划会议，以便统一全国合作社的统计表报和计划工作。这都是全国合作总社为贯彻全国合作社工作者代表会议所决定实现统一领导的方针，在业务和制度方面所必须进行的一些基本工作。
    以上就是我们提请全国总社临时理事会第一次会议审查的工作报告。
