Seeing the So-Called "Traditional Sino-American Friendship" Through the U.S. "Immigration Act"
　　Dai Jing
　　Acheson, Austin, Dulles... These liars, in order to cover up their aggression against China, often spout sweet words like "America has always been a good friend of China" and "traditional Sino-American friendship" . In fact, the various facts of the United States' humiliation and discrimination against overseas Chinese in the United States are enough to show how shameless their lies are.
　　In the U.S. immigration law, one cannot find anti-British laws, anti-Japanese laws, anti-Mexican laws, anti-Indian laws..., but there is specifically an anti-Chinese law. This is the specific expression of the United States' "traditional friendship" with China for a hundred years.
　　When the United States developed the West in the mid-nineteenth century, it used a lot of Chinese labor. In 1868, Anson Burlingame, the U.S. ambassador to the Manchu Qing Dynasty who returned to the United States after resigning from his post, "represented" the Qing government and the United States in signing a "Treaty of Trade, Consular Affairs, and Immigration". The relevant immigration section of the treaty stated: "The United States and the Manchu Qing Empire earnestly acknowledge the inherent and inalienable right of mankind to migrate and change nationality; at the same time, the people of the two countries shall have the convenience of free travel, business, or permanent residence." At that time, the true purpose of the United States in signing this treaty was only to further legalize and scale up the ongoing trade of kidnapping Chinese laborers (called "coolie trade" by the United States). Since the signing of this treaty, the number of Chinese laborers going to the United States has suddenly increased from an average of 2,000 per year to an average of more than 10,000 per year in the following two years. So many overseas Chinese were recruited by the United States to the desolate West, doing hard labor in reclamation, coal mining, and laying railways. Many Chinese laborers died under the extreme heat and overwork.
　　Thanks to the blood and sweat of tens of thousands of Chinese laborers, the east-west transcontinental railroad in the United States was completed in 1880, laying the foundation for the development of the West. At this time, the United States had satisfied its need for Chinese labor, and then signed a new immigration treaty with the Qing government, stipulating that the U.S. government had the right to "control, restrict, or suspend" Chinese laborers from going to the United States when it felt it was detrimental to the United States. At the same time, American bourgeois politicians, in Congress and in "public opinion," opposed "unrestricted immigration," vigorously advocated racial discrimination, brewed anti-Chinese movements, and incited Congress to pass many anti-Chinese immigration laws. For example, they repeatedly submitted proposals to Congress that were racially discriminatory and insulting to the Chinese: "Chinese people are the lowest and most stupid kind in God's creation of mankind... I believe that Chinese people have no souls, and even if they do, they are worthless." On the other hand, American capitalists provoked racial prejudice between Chinese and American workers in order to strengthen the persecution and massacre of overseas Chinese in the United States. For example, in September 1888, 19 Chinese in Rock Springs, Wyoming, were killed by Christian rioters, dozens were injured, and about 600 were expelled.
　　Around the time of the signing of the Burlingame Treaty in the mid-nineteenth century, a large number of Chinese laborers had already gone to the United States. During the thirty years from 1850 to 1880, the number of overseas Chinese in the United States increased sharply by more than 100,000. The U.S. government began to formulate anti-Chinese laws that discriminated against Chinese citizens as early as 1882. This kind of regulation that was unfavorable to overseas Chinese increased year by year. By 1913, it had reached as many as fifteen. The main points were: (1) Prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country; (2) No rough or detailed work is allowed to be imported; (3) Stipulate that the anti-Chinese effect is permanently applicable, and expand it to the territories - Hawaii, the Philippines; (4) Chinese laborers who hold return permits are still prohibited from returning to the United States, etc. After the promulgation of the anti-Chinese immigration law, the number of overseas Chinese in the United States dropped from the peak of more than 100,000 to 62,000 by 1920. In 1924, a new immigration law was issued, stipulating: (1) Based on the total number of foreigners in 1890, 2% may be moved in annually, but limited to "white people"; (2) Chinese laborers are absolutely prohibited from entering the country; (3) Overseas Chinese in the United States who are downgraded from non-workers to workers shall be deported by the U.S. government. In 1930, "New Immigration Regulations for China" were promulgated, further strictly restricting the types of Chinese people entering the United States and adding countless procedures.
　　The number of overseas Chinese in the United States in 1890 was more than 100,000, and in 1940 it was more than 70,000; during the same period, the number of Japanese in the United States increased from 2,000 to more than 122,000 because they were not restricted by the ban. This is a good proof that the U.S. government has "added a unique vision" to the Chinese.
　　As early as December 1943, the U.S. imperialism may have decided to "abolish" the regulations related to anti-Chinese laws in order to show "friendship". At the same time, it announced the implementation of another superficially "equal" "new immigration bill". The bill stipulates that the annual quota for Chinese immigrants to the United States is 105, and it is noted that: (1) The wife or husband of a Chinese American citizen cannot enter the country outside the annual quota of 105; (2) Chinese people born in countries other than China are also counted within the annual quota of 105 when entering the United States. However, the wife or husband of an American white from a foreign country does not count within the annual quota; other white people born in other countries or who are citizens of other countries can enter the United States with the quota of citizens of other countries. Comparing these two, the harshness towards Chinese people and the leniency towards Europeans are obvious. Although a new word is added to the immigration law, the basic spirit of the anti-Chinese law is still at its core.
　　On March 1, 1949, under the instigation of the U.S. government, the "Walter-Judd Act" was proposed and passed with the beautiful statement of "equalizing the immigration of East Asians" (pending approval by the U.S. Senate). This Congressman Walter Judd, who was praised by Kuomintang newspapers as a "friend of China", but in reality is only a "friend of Chiang Kai-shek", is an enemy of the Chinese people. In this bill, he stubbornly divided American citizens into two classes. One is that the wife is within the immigration quota (Chinese Americans), and the other is that the wife is outside the immigration quota (such as American whites from other countries). Because of the promulgation of a "Preferential Treatment Act" by the U.S. imperialism in 1946 (detailed below), the "New Immigration Act" of 1943 was slightly expanded, and the content of the "Walter-Judd Act" returned to the basic provisions of the 1943 Act, which is equivalent to writing off the 1946 Act. It stipulates: "The wife and children under the age of 21 of Chinese American residents who immigrate to the United States shall be deducted from the annual quota of 105." The right of Chinese Americans to connect their wives and children to live with them is also ruthlessly deprived. The number of relatives and children of overseas Chinese waiting to go to the United States left in China exceeds 5,000. In this way, it will take fifty to one hundred years, otherwise there will be no chance to move to the United States. Therefore, even the reactionary newspaper that once praised Walter Judd - the American Daily - had to admit: "This bill actually creates the most unfair treatment for the Chinese."
　　When World War II began, the U.S. imperialism needed tens of thousands of overseas Chinese to fight for it, so it "friendly" allowed non-American overseas Chinese to register for the war as American citizens. On August 9, 1946, a so-called "Bill to give preferential treatment to the wives of Chinese American and Chinese veteran soldiers to come to the United States" was passed. This measure seems to be extremely "enlightened" on the surface, but in reality it is another matter. Because firstly, the Walter-Judd Act of 1949 has denied this "Preferential Treatment Act", and secondly, in specific implementation, it still follows the consistent old method of anti-Chinese law in the United States. For example, in the fall of 1948, the Liang Bixia suicide incident occurred. Liang brought her fifteen-year-old son from China to seek her husband. Her husband was a U.S. Army Sergeant during the war and served in the army for five years. Liang was detained in the Immigration Bureau's detention center for more than three months. She was not allowed to land, nor was she allowed to return to her country, nor was her husband notified. Liang therefore committed suicide. This incident aroused the infinite sympathy of the more than one hundred female compatriots who were detained at the time for Liang and the resentment towards the U.S. imperialism, and they unanimously went on a hunger strike to protest.
　　On the other hand, contradicting the provisions of the "Preferential Treatment Act" of 1946, the U.S. imperialism also formulated a law stipulating: "American soldiers abroad can bring their brides into the country, but Chinese soldiers who marry in China are not included in this example..." Anti-Chinese regulations are everywhere.
　　The U.S. Congress passes the laws, and the U.S. Congress also treats this law as waste paper and immediately overturns it with another law. This is the best evidence of U.S. imperialism's discrimination and abuse of overseas Chinese. This kind of discrimination and abuse has become "friendship" in the mouths of Austin and Dulles.
　　The shamelessness of U.S. imperialism does not stop there. It not only uses the limitations of immigration quotas, but also uses a method of moral depravity to entice some immigrants. On February 23, 1949, the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee passed a bill to reward foreign immigrants who generally provide U.S. intelligence. The bill stipulates: "All foreigners who cooperate with the U.S. Detective Bureau and provide it with information shall be allowed to reside in the United States as a reward." If you are a Chinese or someone of American-Chinese descent, and you cannot obtain the qualification to enter the United States among the "105" people, but you can put away your conscience and work as a detective for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, you can land at the foot of the "Statue of Liberty".
　　The U.S. consulates in Hong Kong and other ports often severely impose all kinds of difficulties on Chinese people applying to go to the United States; they often bear huge debts and can only get an "approval" after being extorted for more than two thousand US dollars in various "fees". Chinese youth students applying for entry also suffer the same discrimination; they have to repeatedly question your fixed U.S. dollar deposit, and if there is any ambiguity, they will not issue an entry permit. The inspection upon landing is even more severe, as if they have caught a "spy".
　　Upon arriving on the coast of the United States, Chinese people must, as a rule, first go to "Angel Island" in San Francisco - called "Angel", but in reality a foreign detention center in hell. In winter, as soon as foreigners from other countries arrive on Angel Island, the Immigration Bureau immediately distributes bedding to them, while Chinese people have to spend the night freezing on iron beds. In the summer, they often fall ill due to being detained in foul and suffocating huts. Waiting in the Immigration Bureau for document inspection, formalities, physical examinations, etc. (only Chinese people entering the country must be inspected and signed by a "American" doctor) often takes a week, two weeks, two or three months, or even sometimes more than half a year. In 1901, overseas Chinese businessmen Cui Zijian and Situ Fang and others represented more than 50,000 overseas Chinese and submitted a document to the Manchu Qing government for the U.S. government's deception and contempt of Chinese people, which can give us an impression of "friendship". It said: "When Chinese people arrive at the port, regardless of whether they are eligible or not, they are imprisoned in wooden houses at the dock. They eat and sleep here, isolated from the inside and outside. Relatives and friends are not allowed to meet, and lawyers are not allowed to ask questions. Even if they are sick, doctors are not allowed to see them. The darkness and filth are worse than prisons. The suppression is more cruel than prisoners. Hundreds of people are often imprisoned, and they are often detained for several months, while their passports are shelved, and no official cares about them. Because of this, there are those who hang themselves, jump into the sea to commit suicide, and die due to lack of medical treatment...." This kind of abuse has not been improved in fifty years. The most unbearable thing is the exhausting interrogation; often in one interrogation, they have to answer two to five thousand "questions". They often arbitrarily cancel entry on the pretext that the confessions do not match, the documents do not match, or the body is sick. Some people have to buy off immigration officials or hire lawyers to appeal (in fact, the two are often colluding) because they have been imprisoned for too long, and then spend another one or two thousand US dollars to get their approval to land.
　　The U.S. entry permit generally carried by Chinese people is usually valid for one year or only a few months. If someone's entry permit is about to expire, but their studies are not completed or their work is not finished, and they cannot leave the United States immediately, then it is like a catastrophe is imminent, and they nervously submit a request for an extension to the Immigration Bureau. After interrogation, if they are lucky enough to get an extension of several months to a year, it is like an amnesty; otherwise, they must interrupt their career or studies and immediately pack their bags and return to their country. Those who are not allowed to continue and do not return to their country on their own will taste the "preferential treatment" of deportation. The term "no right to reside in the United States" is often used by the U.S. Immigration Bureau as a "magic weapon" to exclude Chinese people.
　　Although the U.S. imperialism has "earnestly acknowledged the inherent and inalienable right of mankind to migrate and change nationality...", there is no freedom to speak of for Chinese people to reside in the United States. The boundaries between the white race and the colored race are also strictly separated in an "unwritten" way, and they are not allowed to live together; just for the reason of being a "yellow race", Chinese people often cannot find suitable housing. As a result, Chinese people's American wives are also de facto pushed into the excluded list and have to move out of certain "white areas". If you disregard these de facto racial discriminations and live in white areas, then you are equivalent to challenging the American fascist organization - the Ku Klux Klan's thugs, who will use all despicable and rogue means to bully and insult you until you have to leave there. Overseas Chinese who want to buy property outside of "Chinatown" are often forced to sell and move.
　　In many states and regions, Americans are not allowed to marry Chinese people; Chinese people and their American wives, or American people and their Chinese wives, often suffer secret harm when passing through these states and regions. Therefore, in order to avoid this practical danger, they must part ways when passing through these "dangerous areas". It is very common for American women and their Chinese husbands not to walk side by side on the road in order to avoid being insulted by those who are obsessed with "white supremacy". Even the children of Chinese people, born in the United States and enjoying the citizenship rights of being born in the United States, often suffer great contempt and discrimination in many areas, sometimes even in hotels or cafes.
　　Overseas Chinese are often summoned to court. Many shops and other places do not allow overseas Chinese to enter. In 1948, a Chinese in Philadelphia was beaten for no reason and was thrown into jail and died of abuse. Such things are not uncommon in the United States.
　　Just from this kind of U.S. laws on Chinese people's entry, schooling, residence, and marriage, and its specific facts, we can see that the U.S. imperialism's "friendship" towards overseas Chinese is actually persecution, insult, and racial discrimination.
　　Facts are enough to refute those lies of the American imperialists.

    从美帝“移民法案”看所谓“中美传统友谊”
    戴菁
    艾奇逊、奥斯廷杜勒斯……这些说谎者，为了掩饰其对中国的侵略，经常把“美国一向是中国的好友”，“中美传统友谊”之类的甜言蜜语，挂在他们嘴边。其实，美国凌辱与歧视在美华侨的种种事实，就够说明他的谎言是多么无耻了。
    在美国的移民法中，找不到排英律、排日律、排墨律、排印律……，而偏偏只有个排华律，这就是美国百年来对中国“传统友谊”的具体表示。
    当十九世纪中叶美国开发西部时，使用了不少的华工。一八六八年由卸职回美的驻满清美大使蒲安臣，“代表”清廷和美国订立了“贸易，领事，移民条约”。该条约有关移民部分是这样说：“合众国与满清帝国恳切地承认人类有迁居及改隶国籍的固有的和不可剥夺的权利；同时，两国间的人民得有自由往来、经商或永久居住的便利。”当时美国订这条约的真实目的，只是想把已在进行中的拐骗华工的交易（美国称为“苦工贸易”）更合法化，大量化而已。自从订立这个条约后，去美的华工就从以前的每年平均的二千人，突增到以后两年中的平均每年超过一万余人的数字。这样众多的华侨被美国招募到荒凉的西部，做着开荒、挖煤、敷设铁路的苦工。在酷热与过度劳动下，华工死的很多。
    由于数万华工的血汗代价，美国东西横贯铁路于一八八○年筑成。给西部开发打下基础。这时美国使用华工的需要已经满足，遂与清廷另订新移民条约，规定：美国政府感到于美国不利时，有权“管制，限制或中止”中国的劳工赴美。同时，美国资产阶级政客们，在国会中，在“舆论”上，反对“无限制移民”，力倡种族歧视，酝酿排华运动，鼓动国会通过许多排华的移民律。例如：他们一再向国会提出种族歧视及侮辱中国人的提案：“中国人是上帝创造人类中最低等愚蠢的一种……我相信中国人是没有灵魂的，即使有，亦无价值。”另一方面，美国资本家们则挑拨中美工人的种族成见，以加强对在美华侨的迫害与屠杀。例如：一八八八年九月，怀俄明州岩泉华侨被基督教暴徒杀死者十九人，残伤者数十人，驱逐者约六百人。
    十九世纪中叶蒲安臣条约签订前后，已有大量华侨工人赴美。一八五○至一八八○的三十年间，在美华侨骤增十万余人。美国政府自一八八二年即开始制订歧视中国侨民的排华律，这种不利华侨的条例，年有增加，至一九一三年，已达十五件之多。其要点约为：（一）禁止华工入境，（二）不论粗工或细工均不准入口，（三）规定排华时效永久适用，并扩充至属地——夏威夷、菲律宾，（四）虽持有来回证之华工仍禁返美等项。排华移民律颁行后至一九二○年，在美华侨人数由十万余人之最高峰下降至六万二千人。至一九二四年增颁新移民律，规定：（一）以一八九○年外侨总数为准，按年得移入百分之二，但以“白色人种”为限，（二）华工绝对禁止入境，（三）留美华侨凡由非工人降为工人时，由美国政府驱逐出境。一九三○年颁布了“对华新移民条例”，更严格限制华人入美之种类，并加添无数手续。
    一八九○年在美华侨人数为十万余人，一九四○年为七万余人；同一时期，在美日侨则因未受禁令限制，由二千人增至十二万二千余人。这是美国政府对于中国人“青眼独加”的很好证明。
    早在一九四三年十二月，美帝也许为了表示“友好”吧，居然决心“废除”了有关排华的条例，同时宣布施行了另一表面“平等”的“新移民法案”。该法案规定华人移美每年定额一○五名，并注明：（一）美籍华人之妻或夫不能在每年一○五名限额之外入境；（二）在中国以外之各国出世华人，其入美境时亦算在每年一○五名数额之内。但是美籍白人之妻或夫从外国来美，并不算在每年摊额数内；其他生在别国或为别国公民的白人，却能以别国公民额入美。这两下一比较，对中国人的苛刻，对欧洲人的宽松，就显而易见了。虽然在移民法上加一新字，而底子还是排华律的基本精神。
    一九四九年三月一日在美国政府的指使下，又用“使东亚人移民平等”的漂亮说法，提出并通过了一个“周以德法案”（尚待美上院批准）。这一位被国民党报纸誉为“中国之友”，而实际仅是“蒋介石之友”，却是中国人民之敌的周以德众议员，在该法案中，他硬把美国公民分成两种等级。一种是妻子在移民摊额之内的（美籍华侨），一种是妻子在移民摊额之外的（如其他国家的美籍白人）。因一九四六年美帝有一个“优待法案”的公布（详下），将一九四三年的“新移民法”略予扩充，而“周以德法案”的内容，却又回到了一九四三年法案的基本规定，把一九四六年法案等于一笔勾销了。它规定：“将美籍华裔居民之妻及其未满二十一岁之子女移美，均在每年一○五名的摊额中扣除。”使得美籍华人连接来妻室子女与自己共同生活的权利也被无情剥夺了。留在国内等候去美的侨眷及其子女远超过五千人以上，这样一来，势非要等上五十年至一百年不可，否则毫无轮到移美机会。所以就连那个曾经捧过周以德的反动报纸——美洲日报也不得不承认：“该法案实造成对于华人的最不公平。”
    第二次世界大战开始，美帝需要成万的华侨替他作战，于是“友好”地准许非美籍的华侨当作是美籍国民来报名参战。一九四六年八月九日通过了一项所谓“优待美籍华人及华裔退伍军人妻子来美法案”。这一措施表面看来似乎“开明”已极，然而实际上又另是一回事。因为第一、一九四九年的周以德法案已将这个“优待法案”否定了，第二、在具体执行上，也还是遵从一贯的美国排华的老办法。例如：一九四八年秋，就发生梁碧霞自杀事件。梁携十五岁幼子由中国抵美寻夫，其夫大战时系美军上士，在部队服务五年之久。梁却被拘于移民局候审所三月有余，既不允许上岸，又不准其返国，复不通知她的丈夫，梁因此自尽。此事曾激起当时一起被扣的百余女侨胞对梁的无限同情和对美帝的忿恨，一致绝食抗议。
    另一方面，与一九四六年“优待法案”的规定自相矛盾的，美帝又制订一条法律，规定：“凡在国外之美籍军人可携新妇入境，然华裔军人在中国结婚者不在此例……”。排华的规定，到处都有。
    通过法律的是美国的国会，而把这个法律当成废纸立刻由另一个法律来加以否定的，亦是美国的国会，这也就是美帝歧视和虐待华侨的最好的证据。这种歧视和虐待，到了奥斯汀、杜勒斯口里，都变成“友谊”了。
    美帝之无耻还不止此。它既利用移民额的限定，复以一种精神堕落的方法，去引诱某些移民。一九四九年二月二十三日，美国众议院军事委员会通过了一项酬劳一般供给美国情报之外籍移民的议案。该案规定：“凡与美国侦探局合作，向其供给情报之外人，一律准其来美居住，以示酬谢。”假如你是华侨或美籍华侨的什么人，你不能在“一○五”人中取得入美的资格的时候，而你能把良心收起来去替美国联邦调查局当侦探的话，你就可以在“自由神”的脚下登岸了。
    香港及其他各港口之美国领事馆，对于申请赴美的中国人，经常严厉的施以种种刁难；往往背负巨债，在被勒索了二千元美元以上的各种各样的“费用”后，才可以得到一个“准”字。中国青年学生申请入口时，也遭到同样的歧视；要多般盘问你的定额美金存款，有丝毫不清楚也不签发入境证件。登岸时的盘查，就更要厉害，好像抓到“奸细”一样。
    在抵达美国海岸时，中国人必须照例先到旧金山的“天使”岛——名为“天使”，实为地狱的外侨拘留所去。遇到冬季，别国侨民一到天使岛，移民局马上发被褥给他们，中国人则只得在铁丝床上冻着过夜。夏天则常因被拘于恶浊窒息的小屋里，竟而病倒。在移民局内等候检查证件、办理手续、检查体格等（独有中国人入境，必须经“美籍”医生检查签字），往往须等上一周，二周，两三个月，甚或有时等到半年以上。一九○一年留美侨商崔子肩、司徒芳等代表华侨五万余人，为美国政府欺藐华人，呈满清政府文一段，可以给我们一个“友好”的印象。它说：“华人到埠之时，不问其合例与否，即囚之于码头木屋中。寝食于斯，内外隔绝。亲友不得一见，律师不得一问。即有疾病，医生亦不得诊视。黑暗秽臭，过于监狱。压制苛暴甚于犯人，幽禁常数百人，羁留常数阅月，而护照束阁，关吏无一人过问。因此之故，有悬梁自缢，投海自尽，失医致毙者。……”这种受虐情形，五十年来，迄未有所改善。其中最令人难以忍受的是疲劳盘问；往往在一次审问中，要答复被讯的二千至五千的“问题”。常借口供讯不符，证件不合，或身体有病，而任意取消入口。有的因被监禁太久，只好收买移民局官员或请律师上诉（其实二者常是勾结的），再破费一二千元美元，才得其批准上岸。
    一般中国人所带美国入境证通常是一年期限或仅有数月的。如果有人入境证即将满期，而学业未完或工作未竟，不能立时离美，那时就好似大难临头，惶恐地向移民局提出延期请求。经过讯问后，如幸得通融延续数月至一年，则如同遇赦，否则必须中断事业或学业，马上束装回国。其不得延续而又不自行回国者，就会尝到递解出境的“优待”。“无权居美”一词经常为美国移民局用作排华的“法宝”。
    美帝虽然曾经“‘恳切’地承认人类有迁居及改隶国籍的固有的和不可剥夺的权利……”，但是中国人在美国的居留，是毫无自由可说的。白色人种与有色人种的畛域，也被“不成文”地严格分开，不许混住；就仅仅为了是“黄种人”的缘故，中国人往往找不到适当的住所。以至华人的美籍妻子，也在事实上打入被排斥之列，要从某些“白人区”搬出来住。如果你不顾这些事实上存在的种族歧视，而住入白人区域，那么你就等于向美国的法西斯组织——三Ｋ党的凶徒流氓们挑战，他们会用尽一切卑鄙无赖的手段，欺压侮辱你，直到你不得不离开那里为止。华侨要想在“中国城”以外地区购买产业，常常被迫变卖和迁移。
    在许多州区内，美国人不许与中国人结婚；中国人与美籍的妻子，或美人与华籍的妻子，经过这种州区时，常遭暗害。因此为了避免这种实际的危险起见，他们必须于经过这些“危险地区”时，分道扬镳。一般美国女子与其华籍丈夫，在路上时均不并肩而行，是极寻常的事，为了避免遭受醉心于“白人优越”分子的侮辱。甚至中国人的儿女，生于美国，享有在美出世的公民权利的，在许多地区，有时甚至在旅馆或咖啡馆里，也常受到极大的轻蔑与歧视。
    华侨经常受到法庭传讯。有许多商店和其他地方不准华侨入内。一九四八年费城一个华侨被无故打伤，还给抓进牢里去而致瘐死。这样的事，在美国不算希奇。
    仅仅从美国对于中国人的入境、求学、居住、婚姻等这一类美国法律，和它的具体事实，就可以看出美帝对于华侨的“友谊”，实际上就是迫害与侮辱与种族歧视。
    事实是足以驳倒美帝国主义者们的那些谎言的。
