Chairman, fellow committee members:

Our Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress has now returned to China after completing its mission. Entrusted by the people of the whole country, our delegation reported to the congress the firm will of the Chinese people to defend peace and put forward important proposals for defending peace. The just movement of the Chinese people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, gave great encouragement to the congress and the people of the world. All the proposals of our delegation were adopted by the congress, and the congress and all peace-loving people around the world unanimously expressed their heartfelt respect and sincere support for our people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. Here, we must first deeply thank Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, deeply thank the heroic and outstanding Chinese People's Volunteers, and deeply thank all patriotic compatriots across the country who enthusiastically participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country.

Now, let me give you a brief report on the course and achievements of the Second World Peace Congress and the tasks we should undertake in the future.

Under what circumstances was the Second World Peace Congress convened? On the one hand, the aggressive war bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is frantically expanding its armaments, spreading war propaganda, constantly using atomic weapons for intimidation, and actively rearming Germany and Japan. They unscrupulously tore up the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration, and undermined the United Nations Charter and its institutions. In particular, since June, U.S. imperialism has launched and expanded the war of aggression against Korea, occupied our territory of Taiwan, and continued to expand its armed intervention in the peoples of Vietnam and the Philippines, attempting to complete the encirclement and then launch a full-scale offensive against our country. Thus, peace in Asia has clearly been brutally undermined by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and world peace has been subjected to the most serious threat since World War II. The Second World Peace Congress Declaration begins with the sentence: "War threatens humanity – men, women, and children."

But on the other hand, the world peace camp led by the great Soviet Union is powerful and invincible, and its strength has greatly surpassed the aggressive war bloc. The powerful Soviet Union, the powerful New China, and the various people's democratic countries are closely united and serve as a united fortress of peace, uniting the people of all capitalist and colonial and semi-colonial countries, and carrying out one victorious struggle after another against the imperialist aggressors. Five hundred million people around the world signed the Stockholm Appeal, strongly demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and opposing wars of aggression. Since U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and penetrated into northern Korea, the heroic Korean military and civilians and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers have been engaged in an unyielding struggle to repel the most ferocious and arrogant aggression, restore peace in Asia, and defend world peace, and have achieved significant victories, dealing a heavy blow to the war-mongers' aggressive actions in Korea. And the peace movement in all countries around the world has become even more magnificent in recent months.

Precisely because the forces of peace are so powerful, and the aggressive bloc is nothing more than a paper tiger, precisely because the war-mongers are extremely afraid of the world peace forces, especially afraid of the increasingly united and strong forces, the U.S.-British war bloc has exhausted all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to undermine the holding of the Second World Peace Congress. Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the British Labour government used shameless means such as refusing visas, freezing transportation, and sending special agents to sabotage to obstruct the holding of the congress in Sheffield, England. But these criminal conspiracies of the war-mongers could not but end in miserable failure in the face of the powerful world peace forces. The Second World Peace Congress with great historical significance was finally quickly moved to Warsaw at the invitation of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace and achieved complete success. This fact further exposed the ugly face of the U.S.-British imperialist bloc's deliberate expansion of war and destruction of peace, further increased the hatred of the people of the world for the war-mongers, and strengthened their determination to defend peace.

Thanks to the friendly help of the Polish government and the Polish people, the congress proceeded very smoothly in Warsaw. The congress was declared open on November 16th. On the 17th, Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman, delivered a report on the general activities of the world peace movement since the First World Peace Congress, and on the policy of expanding the peace movement in the face of the current growing war crisis. On the 18th, Nenni, one of the Vice-Chairmen, delivered a report on methods for widely developing the peace movement. Then the congress proceeded with daily discussions, with representatives from various countries freely speaking, providing various opinions and methods on the issues raised in the above two reports. Among them, the Soviet delegation put forward concrete proposals on reducing armaments, stopping war propaganda, and urging the United Nations to fulfill its responsibility for defending world peace and international security as determined at its founding. Our Chinese delegation made a stern condemnation of the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and put forward the following five specific proposals to the congress:

1.  End the aggression of the United States and other countries against Korea, demand the withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea, and achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. This is the central key to the struggle to defend world peace today.
2.  Demand that the United States immediately cease any interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.
3.  Demand that MacArthur be declared a war instigator, as he is the main manufacturer of the war of aggression in the Far East and the main instigator of expanding the Korean War into a world war.
4.  Resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; demand that the government that first uses such weapons be declared a war criminal and sanctioned.
5.  Demand that all countries in the world simultaneously reduce their armaments and establish effective control; suggest that the people of all countries provide mutual assistance in economic and cultural construction under conditions of peaceful coexistence.

These proposals from the Soviet and Chinese delegations constituted the most important part of the congress's resolutions. The congress established seven specialized committees (Political Committee, Committee on the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, General Disarmament and Control, Committee on the Prohibition of War Propaganda, Committee on the Establishment of Normal Economic Relations Between Countries, Committee on the Establishment of Normal Cultural Relations Between Countries, Committee on the Definition of Aggression, and Organizational Committee), comprehensively discussed the speeches of the congress and the opinions of the various delegations, prepared drafts separately, and then submitted them to the congress for approval. On November 22nd, the congress passed two documents of great historical significance, namely the "Declaration to the People of the World" and the "Letter to the United Nations." In addition, it also passed the "Resolution on the Problem of Peace Fighters Suffering Persecution." After electing the new leading body of the world peace movement, namely the World Peace Council, the congress declared its victorious conclusion in a warm and harmonious atmosphere.

The Second World Peace Congress was a historic victory for mankind. Its main achievements are in the following three aspects:

First, it realized an unprecedented great unity of the world's peace forces. Among the 1,756 representatives from 80 countries attending the congress, there were not only representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, but also representatives from capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Italy, and all colonial and semi-colonial countries; not only representatives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but also representatives of capitalists and landlords, not only communists and progressives, but also liberals, conservatives, and Catholics. They truly represented the vast majority of the people in their countries. Although their political views and religious beliefs were very different, they all unanimously demanded peace and opposed wars of aggression. The congress gave full play to the spirit of democracy from beginning to end, and the representatives freely expressed their opinions, knowing everything and saying everything. As Chairman Joliot-Curie said, the congress was truly a "broad international consultation of the people of all countries." The congress consistently implemented the policy of expanding and consolidating the international united front for peace, striving for and uniting all people in all countries, especially capitalist countries, who desire peace and do not desire war, to participate in the peace camp. At the same time, the congress also tried its best to persuade some unprincipled pacifists, so that all the representatives reached a complete consensus under the general policy of "defending world peace must oppose wars of aggression" and "we must not wait for peace, we must strive for peace." The spirit of unity and education of the congress will undoubtedly mobilize the world's peace forces more widely and deeply, and will make the unity of these forces more consolidated and expanded, thereby advancing the world peace movement to a new and higher stage.

Second, the congress formulated a program of struggle to defend world peace. The two historical documents adopted by the congress – the "Declaration to the People of the World" and the "Letter to the United Nations" – comprehensively express this program, which fully conforms to the will of the people of all countries; and pointed out that if the United Nations is not to betray the hopes still placed in it by the people of all countries, its first step should be to "promptly promote the convening of a meeting of the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China – to discuss and peacefully resolve existing differences." The main points of this program are as follows:

1.  Withdraw foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue with the participation of representatives of the Korean people; demand that this issue be resolved by the Security Council, including all members, including representatives of the People's Republic of China. Stop the U.S. military's interference in China's Taiwan and the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
2.  Resolutely oppose the remilitarization of Germany and Japan, and firmly demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified, demilitarized Germany and a peace treaty with Japan, and the withdrawal of troops from both countries.
3.  Oppose colonial policies and racial discrimination.
4.  Any political, strategic, or economic considerations, any reasons concerning the internal situation or internal conflicts of a country, cannot be used as an excuse for any country to interfere militarily in another country. No matter what excuse is used, any country that first uses troops against another country has committed a crime of aggression.
5.  Oppose the war propaganda of the war-mongers. Call on the parliaments of all countries to pass laws guaranteeing peace.
6.  Investigate the crimes of massacre in Korea, especially investigate MacArthur's responsibility.
7.  Unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, biological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; declare the government that first uses these weapons a war criminal; demand that the major powers reduce their naval, land, and air forces by one-third to one-half progressively and simultaneously in the same proportion within 1951 to 1952. An international control with supervision should be established under the Security Council.
8.  Restore normal trade relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and eliminate any form of economic discrimination.
9.  Promote cultural exchanges between countries.
10. Demand that the United Nations not betray the hopes placed in it by the people of the world, and resolutely return to the principles on which it was founded.

This great program of struggle to defend world peace will guide the people of the world to move forward in a more orderly manner, strive forward, and struggle to complete the clear goals stipulated in the program.

Third, the congress produced a new leading body of the world peace movement – the World Peace Council. "This is a group including representatives of the people of all countries, including representatives of member states and non-member states of the United Nations, as well as representatives of affiliated countries and colonial countries." It "bears the lofty task of ensuring a stable and lasting peace that conforms to the vital interests of the people of all countries." Now that the U.S.-British imperialist bloc is trying to seize the United Nations as a despicable tool to support and expand wars of aggression, the peace-loving people of the world should, on the one hand, strengthen the struggle against the U.S.-British bloc's seizure of the United Nations, so that the United Nations can implement the principles it established at its founding, and on the other hand, greatly strengthen the work of the World Peace Council, so that it becomes the true center of world peace. "The World Peace Council will convince all mankind that, despite the difficulties that cannot be underestimated at present, it will surely complete its mission."

Undoubtedly, the above-mentioned main achievements of the Second World Peace Congress fully conform to the will of the Chinese people to resolutely oppose wars of aggression and defend peace in Asia and world peace. At the same time, it is also inseparable from the heroic and victorious struggle of the Chinese people. Precisely because of this, after the closing of the congress, the Chinese delegation issued a statement in Warsaw, clearly stating that "the Chinese people resolutely support the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress and its letter to the United Nations, and resolutely support the congress's various proposals on the prohibition of atomic weapons, general disarmament, the prohibition of new war propaganda, strengthening and promoting economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and clearly defining aggression," "The Chinese people are willing to fully support the newly established World Peace Council in carrying out its work, and are willing to unite more closely with the people of other countries to fight to stop wars of aggression and defend world peace." Now, our entire Chinese people are vigorously launching the sacred movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. This movement is the great work of the Chinese people today, according to their own environment and conditions, most faithfully and effectively implementing the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. This movement has received enthusiastic support from the people of the world. We are by no means isolated. All our patriotic compatriots in China should be mobilized more widely and more deeply to strive for final victory. Justice belongs to us, and victory must belong to us.

The Second World Peace Congress decided to task the delegations of various countries to submit the congress's proposals on defending peace to the legislative bodies of their respective countries. Therefore, as the conclusion of my report, I would like to submit the documents passed by the Second World Peace Congress to this meeting of the Central People's Government Committee in the name of the Chinese delegation attending the Second World Peace Congress, requesting that they be discussed and approved, and that efforts be made to promote their realization.

    第二届世界保卫和平大会的经过、成就和我们今后的任务
    中国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会代表团团长  郭沫若在一九五零年十二月二十六日  中央人民政府委员会第十次会议上的报告主席、各位委员：
    我们出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的中国代表团，在完成了自己的使命之后，现在已经回国了。我们这个代表团受了全国人民的委托，向大会报告了中国人民保卫和平的坚强意志，提出了各项保卫和平的重要建议。中国人民抗美援朝的正义运动和中国人民志愿军的与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，给了大会和全世界人民以极大的鼓舞。我们代表团的各项建议都被大会采纳了，大会和全世界一切爱好和平的人民对我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的运动一致予以衷心的敬爱和赤诚的支持。这里我们首先应该深深感谢中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，应该深深感谢英勇卓绝的中国人民志愿军，应该深深感谢全国热烈参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动的一切爱国同胞们。
    现在让我将二届和大的经过、成就和我们今后所应该担负的任务，向各位作一简要的报告。
    二届和大是在什么情况之下召开的呢？一方面，以美帝国主义为首的侵略战争集团疯狂地扩充军备，扩大战争宣传，并不断用原子武器肆行恫吓，积极地重新武装德国和日本。他们肆无忌惮地撕毁雅尔达协议和波茨坦宣言，破坏联合国的宪章和机构。特别是美帝国主义自六月以来，发动了和扩大着侵略朝鲜的战争，侵占了我国的领土台湾，并继续扩大对越南、菲律宾人民的武装干涉，企图完成包围圈，然后发动对我国的全面进攻。这样，亚洲的和平显然已经遭受到美帝国主义及其仆从的横暴的破坏，世界和平也就遭到了第二次世界大战以来最严重的威胁。二届和大宣言第一句就说：“战争威胁着人类——男女和儿童。”
    但是另一面，以伟大苏联为领导的世界和平阵营却强大无敌，它的力量已经大大超过了侵略战争集团。强大的苏联，强大的新中国，和各人民民主国家，亲密地团结着，并作为和平的联合堡垒，团结起一切资本主义国家和殖民地半殖民地的人民，对帝国主义侵略者，进行着一个胜利接着一个胜利的斗争。遍及世界各国的五万万人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，他们强烈地要求禁止原子武器，反对侵略战争。从美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜战争并深入了北部朝鲜以后，英勇的朝鲜军民和英勇的中国人民志愿军，为了击退最凶恶和最狂妄的侵略，恢复亚洲和平并保卫世界和平，进行着不屈不挠的斗争，取得了重大的胜利，使战争贩子对朝鲜的侵略行动遭受了沉重的打击。而全世界各国的和平运动这几个月来也就更加波澜壮阔了。
    正因为和平力量是如此强大，而侵略集团却只不过是一堆纸老虎，正因为战争贩子们万分害怕世界和平力量，特别是害怕这种力量的愈趋团结和壮大，所以美英战争集团曾经用尽一切阴谋诡计，来破坏二届和大的举行。英国工党政府在美帝国主义的唆使下，用不给签证，冻结交通工具，派遣特务捣乱等等无耻的手段阻挠大会在英国设菲尔德召开。但是战争贩子们的这些罪恶阴谋，在强大的世界和平力量前面，不能不归于惨败。有伟大历史意义的二届和大终于在波兰保卫和平委员会的邀请之下，迅速地改在华沙举行，并得到了圆满的成功。这一事实，更加暴露了美英帝国主义集团蓄意扩大战争与破坏和平的丑恶面目，更加增长了全世界人民对战争贩子的憎恨，加强了保卫和平的决心。
    感谢波兰政府和波兰人民的友好帮助，大会在华沙进行得非常顺利。十一月十六日大会宣布开幕，十七日和大主席约里奥·居里教授作了关于第一届和大以来世界和平运动的一般活动，以及在目前战争危机增长下扩大和平运动的方针的报告。十八日和大副主席之一南尼作了关于广泛开展和平运动的方法的报告。接着大会逐日进行讨论，由各国代表，自由发言，就上述两个报告所提出的问题，提供各种意见和办法。其中苏联代表团提出了关于裁减军备、制止战争宣传和督促联合国履行其创始时所确定的保卫世界和平与国际安全的责任的具体建议。我们中国代表团对美帝国主义的侵略罪行作了严正的谴责，并向大会提出了下列五项具体建议：
    一、结束美国和其他国家对朝鲜的侵略，要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国侵略军，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。这是今天保卫世界和平的斗争的中心关键。
    二、要求美国立即停止对于中国人民解放台湾的任何干涉。
    三、要求宣布麦克阿瑟是战争挑拨者，他是远东侵略战争的主要制造者和将朝鲜战争扩大为世界战争的主要煽动者。
    四、坚决反对原子武器及其他各种大规模毁灭人类的武器的使用；要求宣布首先使用这类武器的政府为战争罪犯而加以制裁。
    五、要求世界各国同时裁减军备，建立有效的管制；建议各国人民在和平共存的条件下作经济文化建设上的相互协助。
    苏联和中国代表团的这些建议构成了大会决议的最重要的部分。大会成立了七个专门委员会（政治委员会，关于禁止原子武器、普遍裁减军备和实行管制的委员会，关于禁止战争宣传的委员会，关于建立各国间正常经济关系的委员会，关于建立各国间正常文化关系的委员会，侵略定义委员会和组织委员会），综合大会的发言及各代表团的意见，分别讨论，作成草案，然后提请大会通过。大会于十一月二十二日通过了两个具有重大历史意义的文件，即《告全世界人民的宣言》和《致联合国书》。此外还通过了“关于和平战士遭受迫害问题的决议》。大会在选举了世界和平运动的新的领导机构，即世界和平理事会之后，就在热烈融洽的空气中宣布胜利闭幕。
    二届和大是人类历史性的大胜利。它的主要的成就有下列三方面：
    第一、它实现了全世界和平力量的空前大团结。在出席大会的八十个国家的一七五六位代表中，不但有苏联、中国和其他人民民主各国的代表，而且有美、英、法、意等资本主义国家，和一切殖民地半殖民地国家的代表；不但有工人、农民、知识分子的代表，而且有资本家、地主的代表，不但有共产党员、进步分子，而且有自由主义者、保守党员，和天主教徒。他们的确代表着各国绝大多数的人民群众，他们的政治见解和宗教信仰尽管有很大的不同，但是他们一致要求和平，反对侵略战争。大会自始至终发挥了充分的民主精神，代表们完全自由地各抒所见，知无不言，言无不尽。正像大会主席约里奥·居里所说，大会真正是“各国人民广泛的国际性的商谈”。大会始终贯彻着扩大和巩固国际和平统一战线的方针，争取和团结各国，特别是资本主义各国的一切愿意和平而不愿战争的人们，参加和平阵营。大会同时对于一些无原则的和平主义者也尽力进行说服，使全体代表在“保卫世界和平必须反对侵略战争”，以及“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”的总方针下，达到完满的一致。大会这种团结和教育的精神无疑地将使全世界和平力量更广泛更深入地动员起来，将使这种力量的团结更加巩固和扩大，从而使世界和平运动迈向新的更高的阶段。
    第二、大会制定了保卫世界和平的斗争纲领。大会所通过的两个历史文件——《告全世界人民的宣言》和《致联合国书》，概括地表达了这个完全符合各国人民意志的纲领；并指出如果联合国要不辜负各国人民仍然寄托在它身上的希望，它的第一步应当“尽速促成五大国——苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国——会议的召开，来讨论与和平解决现存的分歧”。这个纲领的要点如下：
    一、从朝鲜撤退外国军队，在朝鲜人民代表参加之下，和平解决朝鲜问题；要求这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的，包括全体成员的安全理事会来加以解决。制止美国军队对中国的台湾的干涉，对越南民主共和国进行的战争。
    二、坚决反对德国和日本的重新军事化，坚决要求与统一的非军事化的德国缔结和约，与日本缔结和约，并从两国撤兵。
    三、反对殖民地政策，反对种族歧视。
    四、任何政治上的、战略上的、经济上的考虑，任何关于某一国家内部局势或内部冲突方面的理由，都不能作为任何国家武装干涉另一国家的借口。不论用任何借口，凡是首先对别国使用军队的国家，便是犯了侵略罪行。
    五、反对战争贩子们的战争宣传。号召世界各国的议会通过保障和平的法律。
    六、调查在朝鲜的大屠杀罪行，尤其是调查麦克阿瑟的责任。
    七、无条件禁止原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器及其它大规模毁灭人类的各种武器；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯；要求各大国在一九五一年到一九五二年之内，累进地、同时地，以同样的比例，裁减海陆空军三分之一到二分之一。应在安全理事会之下建立有监督权的国际管制。
    八、在平等互惠的基础之上，恢复各国间的正常的贸易关系，取消任何形式的经济歧视。
    九、促进各国间文化上的交流。
    十、要求联合国不要辜负世界人民所寄托给它的希望，坚决回到它所赖以建立的原则上去。
    这个伟大的保卫世界和平的斗争纲领将引导着全世界人民更加整齐步伐，奋力前进，为完成纲领中所规定的明确目标而奋斗。
    第三、大会产生了一个新的世界和平运动的领导机关——世界和平理事会。“这是一个包括世界各国人民的代表的团体，其中有联合国会员国和非会员国的代表，以及附属国和殖民地国家的代表。”它“担负着这种崇高的任务，要保证符合各国人民切身利益的一个稳固而持久和平。”现在美英帝国主义集团正力图霸占联合国作为支持和扩大侵略战争的卑劣工具，全世界和平人民应当一方面加强反对美英集团霸占联合国的斗争，使联合国能够实行它创立时所确定的原则，另一方面应当大大加强世界和平理事会的工作，使它成为世界和平的真正中心。“世界和平理事会将使全人类相信：尽管目前存在着不能过低估计的困难，但它必将完成它的使命。”
    毫无疑问，以上所说的二届和大的主要成就，是完全符合于中国人民坚决反对侵略战争、保卫亚洲和平与世界和平的意志的，同时，也是和中国人民英勇的和胜利的斗争分不开的。正因为这样，中国代表团在大会闭幕后，就在华沙发表声明，明确表示“中国人民坚决拥护第二届世界保卫和平大会的宣言及其致联合国书，并且坚决拥护大会关于禁止原子武器、普遍裁减各种军备、禁止新战争宣传，加强与促进各国间经济与文化交流及明确规定侵略定义的各项建议”，“中国人民愿以全力支持刚成立的世界和平理事会进行工作，并愿与其他各国人民更密切地团结起来，为制止侵略战争，保卫世界和平而斗争”。现在我们全中国人民正在风起云涌地猛烈展开着抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣运动，这个运动就是今天中国人民根据自己的环境和条件，最忠实和最有效地实现二届和大决议的伟大工作。这个运动已经受到全世界人民的热烈支持，我们决不是孤立的，我们全中国爱国同胞应该更加广泛和更加深入地动员起来，为争取最后胜利而奋斗。正义是属于我们的，胜利也一定是属于我们的。
    二届和大决定责成各国代表团务必将大会关于保卫和平的建议，提交各国的立法机关。因此，作为我的报告的结束，谨以出席二届和大的中国代表团的名义，向本届中央人民政府委员会会议提出二届和大所通过的文件，请求予以讨论和通过，并且努力促其实现。（新华社二十六日讯）
