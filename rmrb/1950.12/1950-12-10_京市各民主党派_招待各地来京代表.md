    Beijing Municipal Democratic Parties
    Host Representatives from Various Regions
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Municipal Committees of various democratic parties – the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League, the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Beijing Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League – jointly held a literary and artistic evening on the 8th to host representatives from various regions who came to Beijing to attend the central meetings of the various democratic parties. More than 400 guests were invited to attend. Wu Han, Director of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League, delivered a brief welcome speech at the evening party. He said: Just as the central meetings of the various parties are being held, the good news of smashing the US imperialist aggressor army's "general offensive" and liberating Pyongyang has come from the Korean front. The people of Beijing and all parts of the country are enthusiastically celebrating this great victory. Today's evening party, in addition to welcoming all the representatives, is also a celebration of victory. We firmly believe that after this central meeting, all the representatives will return to their respective regions with rich results, and with greater efforts will promote the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and achieve greater and more brilliant victories. The evening party featured eight programs performed by students from universities and middle schools in Beijing, including self-created anti-US aggression and aid Korea comic dialogues, clapper talks, dramas, and peep shows.
