The Romanian People's Democratic Front Calls on People to Vote for Peace
[Our newspaper's dispatch] On December 3, 1950, the people of Romania will elect representatives to local organs of power—the People's Committees.
The Romanian Workers' Party, the Trade Union Congress, the Peasants' Front, cooperative societies from various regions, the Hungarian People's Union, the Labor Youth League, the Romanian Democratic Women's League, the German Anti-Fascist Committee, the Democratic Jewish Committee, and other minority groups and committees within the country, as well as groups of writers, artists, and scientists, representing the interests and will of the working people, constitute the People's Democratic Front.
The working people of Romania freely expressed their nominations in gatherings at factories, cultural institutions, military units, villages, and collective farms.
In many places, the working people nominated their first candidate with boundless enthusiasm: the General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. Ana Pauker, Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, was also nominated as a candidate in similar circumstances. Furthermore, other leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party, such as Luca, Georgescu, Chișinevschi, Moghioroș, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Dr. Petru Groza, the Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, the renowned scientist Dr. Constantin I. Parhon, were also nominated as candidates.
Outstanding female textile worker Maria Sinca, who manages forty-eight looms single-handedly, Alexandru, a worker at the Bama United Factory, and many other model workers, advanced farmers, tractor driver Constantin, and scientists, artists, and writers beloved by the people, such as Sadoveanu, famous for writing "Heroes of Land Reform," Lama, the standard-bearer of poetry, and the renowned sculptor Caragea, were all nominated as candidates by the people.
On October 14, the People's Democratic Front of the Romanian People's Republic issued a declaration, reporting to the people the achievements the republic has made thus far. From a political perspective, Romania has become one of the world's advanced countries and has achieved great new victories on the road to building socialism.
The declaration mentioned that after the nationalization of major industrial sectors, banks, mining, transportation, and insurance companies in June 1948, Romania's industrial output has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. The 1949 national plan was overfulfilled, and the 1950 plan will also be completed. Countless new industrial sectors are being established or have already been established. The construction of the canal between the Danube River and the Black Sea is also actively underway.
The People's Democratic government has also made significant achievements in agriculture. More than five thousand tractors have been sent to the countryside, enabling farmers participating in cooperative farming to receive assistance from machinery and tractor stations. Collective farms have appeared for the first time in the Romanian countryside, and their number now exceeds one thousand, with many farms achieving yields of up to three thousand kilograms per hectare.
The declaration continued to emphasize that the People's Democratic government is working to eliminate the country's cultural backwardness. The children of the working people have opportunities to learn, and two thousand and twenty-six new schools of various types have been opened, in addition to twenty-nine advanced research institutes, with one hundred and eight new colleges established in universities. There are now eleven thousand cultural centers and ten thousand libraries in the countryside. The creations and inventions of cultural workers and technical science experts are highly valued.
The declaration further stated that the living standards of the working people have improved due to increases in average wages and social benefits. This year, two hundred thousand working people will go to hot springs or other places for recuperation on vacation days, with expenses provided by the state.
Minority groups within the country enjoy equal rights with Romanians, women have been liberated, and young people have good cultural and material conditions.
The declaration enumerated the tremendous achievements of the current provisional People's Committees in construction work and pointed out the prospects for the 1951-1955 Five-Year Plan.
The declaration called on the broad masses of working people to heighten their vigilance and wage a resolute struggle against domestic enemies and the remnants of the reactionary classes, and to resolutely oppose their foreign masters—the American and British imperialists who barbarously and despicably attacked Korea and are attempting to spread the flames of war around the world.
The declaration also emphasized that all the people of Romania look with love and gratitude to the Soviet Union—the strong and unparalleled fortress in the camp of peace, to the liberator and great friend of the Romanian people, the standard-bearer fighting for the peace and freedom of the people—Stalin. The Soviet Union is the guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of the Romanian People's Republic. She liberated Romania from the shackles of fascism, helped her overcome difficulties, and helped her rebuild industry and agriculture.
The declaration concluded with a call: Voting for the candidates of the People's Democratic Front is equal to voting for peace and for the progress of the country.

    罗马尼亚人民民主阵线  号召人民投票拥护和平
    【本报讯】一九五○年十二月三日，罗马尼亚人民将选举地方政权机构——人民委员会的代表。
    罗马尼亚工人党、职工大会、农民阵线、各地合作社、匈牙利人民联盟、劳动青年联盟、罗马尼亚民主妇女联盟、德意志反法西斯委员会、民主犹太委员会以及境内其他少数民族的团体及委员会、作家艺术家和科学家的团体，他们代表了劳动人民的利益与意志组成了人民民主阵线。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民在工厂、文化机关、军队、乡村和集体农场的集会中自由地发表了他们的提名。
    许多地方劳动人民以无限的热情提出了他们的第一位候选人，罗马尼亚工人党总书记乔治·乔治乌——德治。罗马尼亚工人党的书记安娜·波克也在同样情形下被提为候选人。此外，尚有罗马尼亚工人党的其他领袖，如：卢加，乔治斯库，契希纳乌斯奇，莫吉奥罗斯和部长会议主席伯特鲁·格罗查博士，国民议会主席团主席、著名的科学家康斯坦丁·依——巴洪博士等均被提名为候选人。
    杰出的女纺织工，一个人管理四十八台织机的马丽亚·新卡，巴马联合工厂的工人亚历山特鲁及其他许多名列红榜的工人们，先进农民、拖拉机工人康斯坦丁等，为人民所喜爱的科学、艺术与文学家以写《土改英雄》著名的沙杜维亚努，诗歌的旗手拉玛，名雕刻家卡拉其亚等，都由人民提名为候选人。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国人民民主阵线于十月十四日发表宣言，向人民报告了共和国迄今所获的成就。就政治上看罗马尼亚已成为世界上先进国家之一，在走向建设社会主义的道路上已取得伟大的新的胜利。
    宣言中提到，在一九四八年六月，主要的工业部门，银行、矿业、运输以及保险公司等国有化以后，罗马尼亚的工业产量已大大地超过战前。一九四九年的国家计划已超额完成，一九五○年的计划亦将完成。无数的新的工业部门都正在建立或者已经建立起来了。开凿多瑙河与黑海之间的运河也正在积极进行中。
    人民民主政权在农业方面也有重大的成就。五千多架拖拉机已送到农村中，使参加合作耕种的农民得到了机械和拖拉机站的帮助。罗马尼亚农村第一次出现了集体农庄，现在数目已在一千以上，其中有许多农庄的收成每公顷达三千公斤。
    宣言继续着重提出，人民民主政权正着手肃清该国在文化方面的落后性。劳动人民的儿女都有了学习的机会，二千零二十六所新的各种各样的学校已经开办，此外还有二十九所高级研究院，在大学中新设一百零八所学院。在乡村中已有一万一千所文化馆，一万所图书馆。文化工作者及技术科学专家的创作与发明都受到了高度的重视。
    在宣言中更说到劳动人民的生活水准由于平均工资及社会福利的增加而提高了。今年有二十万劳动人民到温泉或其他地方换地休养以度假日，费用均由国家供给。
    境内的少数民族与罗马尼亚人享受同等的权利，妇女获得了解放，青年们有了良好的文化条件与物质条件。
    宣言中历述了现在各地的临时人民委员会在建设工作上巨大的成就，并指出一九五一——五五年五年计划建设的远景。
    宣言号召广大劳动人民提高警惕，与国内敌人及反动阶级的残余作坚决的斗争，并坚决反对他们的外国主子——野蛮而卑鄙地进攻朝鲜以后又企图把战火烧遍全世界的美英帝国主义者。
    宣言又着重指出，罗马尼亚全体人民以热爱与感激的目光注视着苏联——和平阵营中的坚强无比的堡垒，注视着罗马尼亚人民的解放者与伟大的朋友、为人民的和平与自由而斗争的旗手——斯大林。苏联是罗马尼亚人民共和国的独立与主权的保障，她把罗马尼亚从法西斯的枷锁下解放出来，她帮助她解除困难，帮助她重建了工业与农业。
    宣言最后号召称：投人民民主阵线候选人的票，就等于投票拥护和平，拥护国家的进步。
