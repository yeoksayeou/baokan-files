    Vietnam News Agency Comments on Indochina's War Situation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch] Vietnam News Agency recently published a commentary on the war situation in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in Indochina, stating: Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are three small countries that make up the Indochina Peninsula. Although there is a long Mekong River and long mountain ranges between Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, they cannot isolate the people of these three countries, who were invaded by the French imperialist armies almost a century ago. For five years, with the active help of American interventionists, the French imperialists have massacred large numbers of Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian people, and destroyed their homes, towns and villages.
    The French aggressors are also constantly provoking relations between the people of these three countries. However, in the face of the unity of the people of these three countries, the French aggressors' divisive conspiracy has completely failed.
    The commentary continued: For five years, the people of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam have stood shoulder to shoulder to fight resolutely for the liberation of their motherland. The liberated areas in northern, western and southern Laos are expanding and consolidating day by day; and in Cambodia, even the puppets themselves admit that "the situation is serious, and two-thirds of the area is unsafe."
    Since the start of the Vietnamese People's Army's autumn offensive, the Lao and Cambodian People's Liberation Armies have launched powerful attacks on enemy strongholds in the Vientiane area of Laos and the Phnom Penh area of Cambodia.
    Today, Indochina has clearly become a single, unified front, and the liberation wars of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are inextricably linked.
    The commentary pointed out: Recently, the US imperialists have taken more direct steps to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and Cambodia, just as they interfered in the Vietnam War. They are sending advisors and transporting weapons and materials to help the puppet governments of Laos and Cambodia. They plan to turn the entire Indochina into an imperialist base in Southeast Asia. French imperialists and American interventionists are the mortal enemies of the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Only after the last French imperialist and American interventionist have disappeared from Indochina can the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia win complete victory. The commentary concluded: As the Vietnamese people actively prepare for the arrival of a new situation of general counter-offensive, the revolutions of the Lao and Cambodian peoples are rapidly moving forward. Throughout Indochina, the war has become more tense. The increasing activities of the Lao and Cambodian People's Armies have tied down a large number of French troops in the two countries. The people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, who are more closely united, will surely win a brilliant victory, defeat their enemies, and liberate the entire Indochina.

    越南老挝与柬埔寨人民
    团结一致进行解放战争
    越南通讯社评论印度支那抗战形势
    【新华社四日讯】越南通讯社顷就印度支那的越南、老挝与柬埔寨三国的抗战形势发表评论称：越南、老挝与柬埔寨，是构成印度支那半岛的三个小国。在越南与老挝、柬埔寨之间，虽然有一条长的湄公河与长的山脉，但都不能隔绝几乎在一世纪以前即已被法帝国主义者的军队所侵略的这三国的人民。五年来，在美国干涉者的积极帮助下，法帝国主义者屠杀了大量的越南、老挝与柬埔寨人民，并且毁灭了他们的家园、城镇和村庄。
    法国侵略者并不断挑拨这三国人民之间的关系。但是，面对着这三国人民之间的团结一致，法国侵略者的分化阴谋已完全失败。
    评论继称：五年来，老挝、柬埔寨与越南的人民，都肩并肩地共同为他们祖国的解放而进行坚决的战斗。老挝的北部、西部与南部的解放区，正在日益扩大和巩固；而在柬埔寨，就连傀儡们自己也承认：“局势严重，三分之二的地区已不安全。”
    自从越南人民军的秋季攻势开始以后，老挝与柬埔寨的人民解放军，已经向老挝的万象地区以及柬埔寨的百囊奔地区内的敌军据点，进行有力的攻击。
    今天，印度支那显然已经变成一个单一的整个的战线，越南、老挝与柬埔寨的解放战争彼此不可分地联结在一起。
    评论指出：最近，美帝国主义者采取更直接的步骤，以干涉老挝与柬埔寨的内政，正象他们干涉越南战争一样。他们正在派遣顾问、运送武器与物资帮助老挝及柬埔寨的傀儡政府。他们计划把整个的印度支那变为帝国主义者在东南亚的基地。法国帝国主义者和美国干涉者是越南、老挝与柬埔寨人民的死敌。只有在最后的一个法帝国主义者与美帝国主义者都从印度支那绝迹以后，越南、老挝与柬埔寨人民才算赢得完全的胜利。评论最后称：随着越南人民积极准备总反攻新形势的到来，老挝与柬埔寨人民的革命正在迅速向前发展。在印度支那全境各地，战争已经更趋紧张。老挝与柬埔寨人民军队的日益增加的活动，已在两国境内牵制了大量的法军。团结得更紧的越南、老挝与柬埔寨的人民，一定能够赢得辉煌的胜利，击败他们的敌人，并解放整个印度支那。
