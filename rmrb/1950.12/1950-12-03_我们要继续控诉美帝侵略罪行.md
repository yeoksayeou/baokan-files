The people of the world have listened with great attention and sympathy to the accusation made by Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of China attending the United Nations Security Council, against the U.S. imperialist aggression against China. This just and reasonable accusation has been hailed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and has made the warmongers and American imperialists panic. This indictment is a masterpiece of the Chinese diplomatic history of the past 100 years, demonstrating the people's righteousness and national dignity. Only the diplomatic representative of the People's Republic of China can issue such a righteously worded indictment on behalf of the Chinese people.

Because our country has been unreasonably excluded from the United Nations organization for a year, the three proposals in the indictment submitted by our special representative still had to be formally submitted by the Soviet representative Malik. The Soviet representative also put forward the Soviet Union's reasonable draft resolution on the U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan. At the Security Council meeting on the 29th, the U.S. imperialists once again used their majority voting machine to reject our proposal and the Soviet proposal. The Yugoslav representative, who was the chairman of the Security Council and colluded with the U.S. representative, forcibly ranked the order of speech of our representative Wu Xiuquan as the second when our representative Wu Xiuquan attended the Security Council meeting. On November 29th, he also participated in the veto under the instructions of the United States. The "fair posture" that the Yugoslav representative had often pretended in the United Nations was completely stripped off this time, revealing the original shape of an imperialist lackey. Britain also participated in this veto, which also proved the hypocrisy of Britain's "expression of friendship" to China. The U.S. imperialists certainly opposed our country's and the Soviet Union's proposals, which goes without saying, because it is the accused criminal. However, the representatives of the imperialist group in the United Nations Security Council treated our representative's just accusation in this way, and openly rejected China's reasonable proposal and the Soviet Union's fair proposal. Then, this further exposed that the imperialist aggressive group was attempting to adhere to the U.S. plan to invade China's territorial sovereignty. Proposals such as those put forward by China and the Soviet Union, which fully conform to the spirit of the United Nations Charter and can most effectively guarantee world and Far East peace, have been rejected. This further exposes that the imperialist aggressive group is attempting to adhere to the line of war in the current international situation. But, no matter what, the Chinese people completely despise this veto by the imperialist aggressive group. We will continue to accuse the U.S. imperialists of their aggressive crimes; we will continue to raise the solemn demands we have already made. We want to solemnly warn the warmongers of the imperialist aggressive group, don't even think about turning black into white. Taiwan has always belonged to China. Although it is temporarily occupied by you, we will carry out military recovery at any time, whether it is in the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang or in the hands of the American imperialists.

The Soviet Union is the great ally of the Chinese people, and this has been given another noble proof this time. The Soviet representative submitted our proposal on our behalf, and also submitted its own identical proposal, fully supporting the just demands of the People's Republic of China, and became the only country to vote in favor. The Chinese people sincerely thank you for this deep friendship. Not only that, but when the Soviet representative voted on the proposal of the six countries including the United States, Britain and France, he opposed the shameless slander of China by the U.S., British and French groups, exercised the veto power, and became the only country to vote against it. Who are the friends of the Chinese people, and who are the enemies of the Chinese people, this is an obvious fact.

What is the essence of the six-nation proposal? It is completely to satisfy the greed of American imperialism to control Korea, and it is completely to play with the name of the United Nations to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the American aggressors. It attempts to deceive us by saying that it "respects China's interests," but in fact it is to further extend the flames of war to Chinese territory. The imperialist aggressive group never condemns its own criminal acts, and even turns a blind eye to the serious fact that the U.S. imperialist military aircraft invading Korea have repeatedly violated China's airspace more than 200 times. It always pretends to be sweet and says that it "respects the Sino-Korean border of China" and "fully protects the legitimate Sino-Korean interests in the border area." It simply wants to treat the Chinese people as fools. Didn't MacArthur launch a general offensive to the Yalu River on November 24? Isn't this general offensive carried out by MacArthur bearing the banner of the United Nations? The People's Republic of China is neither the Republic of China in the Chiang Kai-shek era, nor the Republic of China in the Yuan Shikai era, nor the Qing Empire in the Nala clan (Empress Dowager Cixi) era. It will neither fall into any scams, nor will it be overwhelmed by any multi-nation proposals. The heroic behavior of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country will not only not be stopped by any six-nation proposal, but will be further persisted. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government strongly praised the heroic behavior of the Chinese People's Volunteers in a telegram to the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce on the 2nd. This precisely shows the will and determination of the Chinese people, because this action fully demonstrates the great spirit of the Chinese nation and fully conforms to the lofty interests of the Chinese people. The Chinese people deeply believe in Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction: "The Chinese people are bound to win the final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression."

### 我们要继续控诉美帝侵略罪行

    我们要继续控诉美帝侵略罪行
    全世界的人民都以极大的注意和同情听见了中国出席联合国安全理事会的特派代表伍修权对于美帝侵略中国的控诉。这一正义的与合理的控诉在全世界爱好和平的人民中受到欢呼和拥护，而使战争贩子们和美国帝国主义者手足失措。这一篇控诉状是中国一百年来外交历史文件中表现了人民正气和民族尊严的杰作。只有中华人民共和国的外交代表才能代表中国人民发出这样义正词严的控诉状。
    由于一年来我国被美帝无理拒绝于联合国组织之外，因此，我国特派代表提出的控诉状中的三点提案仍不得不由苏联代表马立克正式代为提出。苏联代表又提出了苏联关于美帝侵略台湾的合理的决议草案。在二十九日的安理会上，美帝再一次运用了它的多数的表决机器，否决了我国的提案，又否决了苏联的提案。担任安理会主席的与美帝代表勾结的南斯拉夫代表，当我伍修权代表出席安理会时，把我伍修权代表的发言次序硬排在第二。在十一月二十九日，他又在美国指示下参加否决。南斯拉夫代表以前在联合国经常伪装的“公正姿态”，在这次完全剥落下来，赤裸裸地现出帝国主义走狗的原形了。英国也参加了这次否决，同样证明了英国对中国“表示友好”的虚伪性。美帝当然要反对我国和苏联的提案，这倒用不着说，因为它是被控诉的罪犯。但是，联合国安理会中帝国主义集团的代表这样来对待我国代表的正义控诉，公然否决中国的合理提案和苏联的公正提案，那末，这就更暴露了帝国主义侵略集团是企图坚持美国对中国领土主权的侵略计划了。像中国与苏联所提出的这样完全符合联合国宪章的精神并且能够最有效地保障世界与远东和平的提案，竟然都被否决了，那末，这就更暴露了帝国主义侵略集团是企图坚持在目前国际局势中战争的路线了。但是，不管怎么样，中国人民完全蔑视帝国主义侵略集团的这一否决。对于美帝的侵略罪行，我们还要继续加以控诉；对于我们已经提出的严正要求，我们还要继续加以提出。我们要正告帝国主义侵略集团的战争贩子们，你们休想以黑为白。台湾始终是属于中国的，现在它虽然暂时被你们所侵占，但是我们随时都要进行军事收复，不论它在蒋介石匪帮手里，还是在美国帝国主义者手里。
    苏联是中国人民伟大的盟邦，这次又得到一次高贵的证明。苏联代表代我们提出了我们的提案，又提出了自己的相同的提案，完全支持中华人民共和国的正义要求，而成为投赞成票的唯一国家。中国人民衷心感谢这种深厚的友谊。不仅这样，苏联代表在表决美英法等六国提案时，反对美英法集团对中国的无耻诬蔑，运用了否决权，又成为投反对票的唯一国家。谁是中国人民的朋友，谁是中国人民的敌人，这是再明显不过的事实了。
    六国提案的本质是什么呢？是完全为了满足美国帝国主义控制朝鲜的贪欲的，是完全玩弄联合国的名义来替美国侵略者火中取栗的。它企图欺骗我们，说什么“尊重中国的利益”，而实际上是要将战争的烽火，更进一步延烧到中国的领土上来。帝国主义侵略集团从不谴责一下自己的犯罪行为，甚至对于美帝侵朝的军用飞机连续侵犯中国领空二百次以上的严重事实，也都熟视无睹，一味装出甜言蜜语的样子，说是“尊重中国的中朝边境”，“充分保护边界区域中的中朝合法利益”，简直想把中国人民当傻子看待。难道麦克阿瑟不是在十一月二十四日又发动了打到鸭绿江边的总攻势吗？难道这个总攻势不是麦克阿瑟肩起联合国的旗帜来进行的吗？中华人民共和国，既非蒋介石时代的中华民国，也非袁世凯时代的中华民国，更非那拉氏（慈禧太后）时代的大清帝国，既不会堕入任何骗局，更不会被什么几国提案所骇倒。中国人民志愿军的抗美援朝保家卫国的英雄行为，不仅不会因为什么六国提案而停止，而且将更加坚持下去。中央人民政府毛泽东主席在二日复天津工商业联合会的电报中，对于中国人民志愿军的英勇行为，力加赞扬。这正是表示了中国人民的意志与决心，因为这一行动，完全表现了中国民族的伟大精神，完全符合中国人民的崇高利益。中国人民深信毛泽东主席的指示：“中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。”
