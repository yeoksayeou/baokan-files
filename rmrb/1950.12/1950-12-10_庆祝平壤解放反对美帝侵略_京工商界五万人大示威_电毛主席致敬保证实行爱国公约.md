Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Over 53,000 people from Beijing's industrial and commercial circles held a grand demonstration today celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang and opposing American imperialist aggression. Representatives from 136 industry guilds throughout the city participated in the parade. All industrial and commercial households in the city hung national flags and posted slogans, as if celebrating a festival.

The demonstrators began gathering at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium at 8:00 AM. The venue was filled with red flags, the sounds of gongs and drums, and singing. At 11:40 AM, Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the general leader of the demonstration parade, delivered a speech from the command vehicle. He said: "This patriotic demonstration parade is unprecedented in the history of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. We must unite as one, put our five patriotic pacts into practice, and use practical actions to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang and oppose American imperialist aggression." Subsequently, the entire audience unanimously approved telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The parade set off at 11:50 AM, advancing in a mighty procession towards Qianmen Street, the commercial center of Beijing. The parade was led by a band and a waist drum team, followed by a slogan team composed of sixty representatives. They held aloft huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, as well as banners reading "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country" and "Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Celebrating the Liberation of Pyongyang and Opposing American Imperialist Aggression Demonstration Parade." Huge slogan boards displayed slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live General Kim Il-sung!" "Long Live the Solidarity of the Chinese and Korean People!" "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression!" as well as the content of the five patriotic pacts of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles and the covenants of various guilds. The financial industry covenant stated: "Do not speculate on goods, do not blindly issue loans, and guarantee price stability!" The local produce and food industry covenant stated: "Promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, shoulder the task of bridging the gap, assist the government in regulating supplies, and stabilize prices!" The flour industry covenant stated: "Guarantee the supply of flour in this city and assist the government in stabilizing social order!" The electrical materials industry covenant stated: "Coordinate with national defense construction using electrical technology!" The boot and shoe industry covenant stated: "We are determined not to use American leather!" The parade also held aloft many portraits of General Kim Il-sung, President Ho Chi Minh, and leaders of people from all over the world, as well as many slogans. The shouts of the marching masses resounded through the clouds. They shouted "Celebrate the Liberation of Pyongyang!" "Support the Korean People!" "Defeat American Imperialist Aggression!" "Oppose Speculation and Profiteering!" "Oppose Disrupting Finance!" "Guarantee the Completion of Tax Payments!" "Do Not Listen to Rumors!" "Strictly Guard Against Bandits and Special Agents!" "Workers and Capitalists Unite to Strengthen Production!" When the parade reached the reviewing stand at Qianmen Arrow Tower, the shouts and cheers reached their climax.

Standing on the reviewing stand were Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression; Chen Shutong; Xu Deheng, Standing Committee Member; Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch; Liu Ren, Wu Han, Zeng Zhaolun, and Shu Sheyu, Vice Chairmen; Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; and representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations in Beijing. They applauded frequently, paying their respects to the demonstrators. Fu Huating, the general leader of the parade, and Han Songshang, Ling Qijun, Liu Yifeng, and Pu Jiexiu, the deputy general leaders, stepped onto the reviewing stand, representing the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Demonstration Parade, and presented two silk banners and gifts of appreciation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The banners read: "Highly Develop the Great Spirit of Combining Chinese Patriotism and Internationalism" and "The Victory Forever Belongs to the Korean People Who are Struggling for Democratic Happiness."

The parade then proceeded in two directions, east and west. The west route went through Xijiaomin Lane, Xidan Street to Pinganli; the east route went through Dongjiaomin Lane, Wangfujing Street, Dongsi Pailou, and returned to Dongdan Square. When the parade passed through the streets, the people who remained in the factories and shops poured into the streets, applauding and welcoming them, and shouting slogans along with the marchers. Some shops even set up hot tea and cigarettes in front of their doors to treat the parading crowds. When the parade passed the former American Consulate in Dongjiaomin Lane, the emotions of the marching masses were heightened, and the slogan "Down with American Imperialism" was even louder. The parade ended at 3:30 PM.
