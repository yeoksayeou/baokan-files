Xinhua News Agency Report: People in various locations are celebrating the great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in crushing the American bandits on the Korean battlefield.

The victory news has inspired 800,000 people in Harbin City, Northeast China. On the morning of the 2nd, people scrambled to get the extra edition of the Songjiang Daily. Students from various schools organized collective parades and demonstrations to celebrate the great victory in Korea. The Harbin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression decided to hold a city-wide celebration rally on the 3rd and will send cigarettes, soap, towels, and fattened pigs to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. In Qiqihar, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, the entire city was filled with greater confidence in winning the struggle to resist American aggression and defend the homeland after hearing the news of the victory on the Korean battlefield. Inspired by the victory, all the workers of the Nenjiang Textile Factory, who are carrying out a vigorous patriotic production competition, saw the fine spinning team create a new record of 475 jin of yarn produced per day, an unprecedented feat for the factory. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Su Shechi workshop team of the Qiqihar Flour Mill, who were originally off duty, continued to work after hearing the news of the victory. When the good news reached Chengde City, Rehe Province, cheers immediately erupted in the bustling streets. People from all walks of life spontaneously initiated a comfort campaign, and letters and comfort bags have begun to be collected and will soon be mailed to Korea.

On the evening of the 1st, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily issued a special edition on the victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in crushing the American bandits' offensive. The news of the victory immediately spread throughout the mountain city, and more than one million people were overjoyed and inspired. A certain unit of the Chongqing Garrison Command shouted in unison, "Well done! Well done!". Workers at the No. 1 Power Plant of the Chongqing Electric Power Company were overjoyed when they heard the news of the victory in Korea during the night shift change, shouting and jumping for joy, and expressed their determination to show their resolve to resist American aggression and aid Korea with practical actions such as reducing coal consumption and generating more electricity. Shop assistants who were just leaving a meeting of the shop employees' union also loudly read the good news to the masses on the streets. After the victory news reached the Shapingba cultural district, the broadcasting stations of the student unions of various schools immediately began broadcasting. Many school students expressed their desire to apply for military cadre schools. Students in the Chinese Department of Southwest Normal College actively donated comfort items and wrote letters of sympathy, while female students rushed to make comfort bags, preparing to send them to the heroic Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency Report: All sectors of the capital warmly celebrate the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in crushing MacArthur's "general offensive".

Workers in Beijing celebrated jubilantly upon hearing the news. Some workers at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau were so excited after hearing the news on the radio last night that they couldn't sleep well and ran to the bureau early in the morning to tell others. After hearing it, some jumped up, and some hugged each other. The workers of the Second Line Engineering Corps said: This victory further proves that American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. In order to completely smash the crazy aggression of American imperialism, the young ones are preparing to apply to military cadre schools, and the older ones will work hard to produce. Liu Botian of the Seventh Branch said: "This MacArthur is here to be our transportation captain again." Zhu Hongsheng, an employee of the Telegraph Office, said: "MacArthur's promise to go home for Christmas is just a curse for the American troops invading Korea to return to their hometowns." Liu Ying and Guo Yuanzhen said: "Let's make another comfort bag, put today's newspaper in it, and send it to the front lines to encourage the Chinese and Korean soldiers to continue their efforts and wipe out the American-Li bandit troops."

Faculty and students of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Jiaotong University, and Beijing Academy were extremely excited after hearing the broadcast. Early on the 2nd, posters celebrating the victory posted by departments such as the Law Department appeared on Democracy Square at Peking University. They also called on students to take advantage of this great victory to actively participate in military cadre schools.

Students from Beijing Agricultural University immediately formed teams, beat gongs and drums, and reported the good news to the nearby rural areas. A celebration rally was held at noon. The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, encouraging them to give the American aggressor troops an even greater blow until the enemy is completely wiped out. At the celebration rally at the Beijing Russian Language School, firecrackers and drums resounded, and a congratulatory letter was written on red silk with signatures and sent to the Korean front.

A brief celebration rally was held on the lawn of Yenching University on the afternoon of the 2nd. At the meeting, the Department of Economics launched a campaign to make cotton gloves and woolen socks to give to the people's heroes, and Wang Enshan, a student in the Department of Journalism, proposed that each person write a letter of sympathy, which was enthusiastically supported by the faculty and students attending the meeting.

Chen Yuan, the president of Fu Jen Catholic University, excitedly wrote a large inscription on a four-foot-long piece of paper: "Having read today's newspaper, I am delighted to learn of the great victory of the counterattack by the Chinese and Korean troops. All the faculty, staff, and students of Fu Jen Catholic University respectfully salute the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army." The students framed it with glass and hung it on the wall in front of the auditorium.

Schools such as No. 4 Middle School, Guanghua Girls' High School, Yanji Girls' High School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 1 Girls' Middle School, Datong, Huiwen, Muzhen, Yuying, and Baiman excitedly held victory parades. More than 100 students from two classes in the third grade of No. 2 Middle School went to the outskirts of Beijing to report the good news to the farmers.

When students in Class 4 of the second grade of the Normal University Affiliated Middle School were quietly listening to the recitation of the good news, a student named Huang Weilong exclaimed: "I dedicate my gold pen to the heroes fighting in Korea!" He took out the gold pen that his sister had given him as a souvenir when he returned from Nanyang. His actions moved all the students in the class. Lin Hongjin held a gold chain in his hand and said excitedly: "I dedicate my gold chain. This gold chain was left to me by my grandmother when she died when I was six years old, and it has been with me for twelve years. There is a fiery heart on the gold chain, and it will be connected to the hearts of the Korean heroes." Liu Jianyu, his face flushed, said excitedly and stutteringly: "When I returned from Nanyang, my mother gave me a gold ring as a souvenir. Today, I want to dedicate it. I originally wanted to donate my gold pen, but since I cannot go to the front lines immediately, I want to use this pen to study hard, so I decided to donate this swimming watch of even greater value." At this time, the whole class was in a frenzy. Everyone was thinking about how to send their fiery hearts to the heroes fighting in Korea.

Students from No. 1 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, No. 4 Girls' Middle School, Hebei High School, Beijing Normal University, Finance and Economics, North China, Xinsheng, and Youzhen Girls' Middle School also cheered and jumped for joy after learning of the good news, and held gatherings to celebrate.

The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement, celebrating this historically significant victory. At the same time, they expressed extreme contempt and indignation at the series of threatening and shameless statements made by war-mongers such as Truman, Acheson, and MacArthur after their disastrous defeat. They also warned them that the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China are fully confident of repelling any imperialists who dare to invade China and its neighbor, Korea. At the same time, they hoped that all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea will continue their efforts and fight to the end to crush the aggressive actions of American imperialism and win the final victory! The industrial and commercial circles of Beijing vow to be the strong backing!
