    Ward and His "Consulate"
    Wang Ping
    The Chinese people will forever remember the sinister name of Angus Ivan Ward. Even today, when former Chinese employees of the "U.S. Consulate in Shenyang" such as Ji Yuheng, Yu Yongbin, Fang Pinqing, and Wu Hanzhang mention him, they grind their teeth with hatred. The files of the "U.S. Espionage Case" and the "Beating of Chinese Workers Case," forever preserved in the Chinese People's Public Security Organs and People's Courts, also speak with the force of living witnesses, issuing powerful accusations against the American imperialist elements.
    Every word and sentence here is as real and reliable as a nail hammered into wood.
    From this record, one can associate with everything about America. Because what happened in this small "Consulate" can essentially reflect the entirety of the United States.
    Such a country, such an enemy, should rightly provoke our hatred, contempt, and disdain.
    I. Ward Starts Causing Trouble the Moment He Gets Off the Train
    "Consul General" Ward walked extremely fast. His American leather shoes clattered loudly on the ground. At the end of March 1947, when Ward's "special car arrived in Shenyang" to take office, he stepped off the train and strode past the line of Chiang Kai-shek bandit officials standing respectfully to greet him. A porter, Old Yang, didn't have time to get out of the way and became Ward's fleshy target for kicking his leather shoes upon arriving in Shenyang. The next day, Ward whipped a Chinese cart driver. Because the cart driver was pulling hard to get the cart carrying Ward's luggage up a slope, Ward snatched the whip and struck the driver's shoulder several times heavily, asking:
    "Does it hurt?"
    "How could it not hurt?"
    "Then why are you hitting the horse? If you hit the horse, I'll hit you!"
    This is the exposure of the bestiality of imperialist elements. Ward's wife, Irma, wouldn't allow spoiled eggs or rotten fish to be used to feed her beloved cat, but kept them for the Chinese workers to eat. The U.S. Army Command in Tianjin stipulated that if a jeep hit and killed a donkey, the compensation was $13 U.S. dollars; if it hit and killed a Chinese person, the compensation was only $10 U.S. dollars... All of this comes from the same source.
    Ward, like all imperialist elements, extremely looked down on the Chinese. He cursed the Chinese as having "corruption and filth in their blood; dishonesty from the moment they are born." He often used "Bastard!", "God Damned!" (which literally translates to "God curse you!" equivalent to the Chinese "混蛋!"); and even the most vulgar phrase in the American language, "Son of the bitch!", to insult Chinese people.
    II. "Dog Consul" Hubbard
    Everyone in the "Consulate," from top to bottom, feared the brutally-natured Ward; only one person didn't fear him, and he even had a bit of fear of this person.
    This person was his subordinate "Consul" Fred H. Hubbard.
    What did Hubbard do?
    He was the equivalent of the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" headed by U.S. spy chief Hoover. After arriving in China, he served as an instructor training Chiang Kai-shek bandit spies at the sinfully infamous "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" (SACO). The spies who assassinated Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo in Kunming with silent pistols, and Qi Yulin, who assassinated Mr. Yang Jie in Hong Kong, as well as the spies involved in the bloody corpse case in Changchun and the massacres in Chongqing and Guiyang, were all trained at the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization."
    Hubbard was the head of the "Investigation Report Group" at the "Consulate." Military and political affairs were the main objects of his "investigation reports." His house was filled with a gloomy atmosphere, and under the long, large curtains were military maps marked with various symbols. If a Chinese worker stayed in his house for a few extra minutes while sweeping the floor or wiping the table, disaster would strike. Because he was always with that big yellow dog, and what he did was akin to the work of a hunting dog, Chinese workers called him "Dog Consul" behind his back.
    III. Insults to Chinese Employees
    In the United States, all civil servants must sign a "loyalty oath" to the U.S. government, and some even have to swear an oath. This kind of "high degree of democracy" was also brought to "Consulates" in various countries by American diplomats. China was, of course, no exception.
    Chinese people who worked in the U.S. "Consulate" or "United States Information Service," whether staff members or laborers, had to be introduced by reliable people and investigated to ensure that they were politically and ideologically sound before being employed. The first thing upon entering was to sign a "resume form" that required answering thirty-two questions: the names, addresses, and occupations of your brother-in-law, sister-in-law, cousin, etc., had to be written clearly. They also stipulated that strikes were not allowed under any circumstances (but the U.S. Constitution does not restrict workers' strikes. When someone asked Ward about this, he said: "Those working for the U.S. government are civil servants, not workers!"). You couldn't be employed without signing it, even the laborer who cleaned the toilets had to make a fingerprint on it. In addition, there was another type of form that required listing five "reputable" guarantors in society who would guarantee that the worker would not have problems politically, ideologically, or in their work.
    This type of form had to be refilled every year or two. In the spring of 1948, when the People's Liberation Army launched a victorious offensive in the Northeast, Shenyang was in a state of emergency, and the anti-communist arrogance of the United States was high, the Chinese employees of the "Consulate" were all called in. Each person brought two photos and, under the supervision of Hubbard and others, filled out a "Declaration of Not Opposing the U.S. Government." Each person had to put the fingerprints of all ten fingers on the form. The seriousness of the form was like the exaggerated scenes in American movies dealing with notorious bandits.
    Even so, Ward was still on guard against and hostile towards the Chinese people in every way. He would often suddenly ask Chinese employees strange questions: "What do you think of the U.S. government?" "Which do you think is better, the Kuomintang regime or the Communist regime?" An unprepared answer would become the underlying reason for one of your "mistakes." In investigating the ideology of Chinese employees, Ward's wife, Irma, like any American diplomat's wife, became the most powerful assistant. She would use her long tongue to induce you to speak, and your casual remarks would become good material for her gossip. Some honest Chinese employees often thought that Irma was "easy to talk to and liked to talk," and wanted to satisfy a subconscious desire for curiosity from her mouth, but they were easily tricked.
    After the liberation of Shenyang, Ward's "sudden questioning" style became even more intense. Because he found that the Chinese employees were becoming more and more "scary," and more and more unsettling to him; the results of each "sudden question" did indeed prove this point. During the "May 1st" parade in 1949, when the streets were filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and cheers resounded, he suddenly asked a Chinese employee who handed him something:
        "It's very lively today, isn't it?"
        The Chinese employee ignored him.
        He simply called out the name of the Chinese employee and asked:
        "Are you very happy?"
        "Yes. Some people are very happy today, and some people are very unhappy." This was the answer he received. This answer was "rude" as never before.
    IV. A "Charitable" Face, a Vicious Heart
    Before the liberation of Shenyang, the "U.S. Embassy" in Nanjing sent a survey form drafted by "Cultural Attaché" Mulberger, asking Fox, a diplomatic personnel in Shenyang, to investigate the "situation" of culture and education in the Northeast, saying it was to be the basis for "relief" from a certain American "charitable organization" and a certain "great philanthropist." There were more than twenty questions in the survey. The first third of the questions were "How is the food?" "What books are lacking?"...; the last two-thirds of the questions were: "What do you think of China's future?" "What do you think of the prospects for 'Suppressing the Rebellion'?" "Are you satisfied with U.S. policy toward China?" "What are your opinions on the measures taken by the Nanjing government?"...
    This was to gather ideological intelligence. It was to understand the ideological trends of the people in Northeast China through the cultural and educational circles, as material for formulating policies to help the Kuomintang reactionary government further oppress the people, so as to achieve the U.S. imperialist policy of enslaving China.
    There was another time – when the Beining Railway had already been cut off by our People's Liberation Army, and the liberation of Shenyang was imminent. Ward's intelligence had confirmed that the Chiang bandits would collapse soon, and he suddenly telephoned "Commander-in-Chief" Wei Lihuang, asking him to immediately send the "Railway Bureau Chiefs" of "all of Northeast China" to the "Consulate," saying that the "Sino-American Economic Cooperation Administration" had an important "commission." The five puppet bureau chiefs put in a great effort (because the railway was cut off by us, and transportation was difficult) to arrive at the "Consulate" at eight o'clock in the morning. A message came out from inside: "'Consul General' has an important meeting, please wait downstairs for a while." The wait lasted for one or two hours. After the important meeting upstairs was over, the five "bureau chiefs" anxiously and cautiously went to see the "Consul General," who said in a solemn manner:
    "The Economic Cooperation Administration is preparing to allocate a large number of sleepers, rails, and other important railway equipment from the United States to help restore the Northeast Railway. Now, please list in detail the existing sleepers, rails, and other important railway equipment in each bureau, so that they can be allocated as needed."
    In this way, the American spies grasped the intelligence of the Northeast railway materials. And this was part of a pre-arranged conspiracy to sabotage the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, because soon after, the entire Northeast region was completely liberated.
    V. "Travel" and "Research"
    During the period when the Kuomintang bandits ruled, military attachés of the "U.S. Embassy" in Nanjing such as Lang Ege, Beraudtray, and Ward and Stocke liked to "travel." The front lines and factories in Benxi, Fushun, Liaoyang, and Jinzhou were their "travel" destinations. A military attaché named Rick "deeply traveled" to the outer defense line of the People's Liberation Army in Changchun and was captured by the People's Liberation Army while "enjoying the scenery" with his telescope standing on a jeep. Ward himself was particularly "interested" in Fushun and Anshan, having gone "traveling" five times, and used several remnants of Japanese fascists to specially compile "data" on the reserves, maximum output, annual output, and mechanical equipment of Fushun coal, Anshan iron, and Jinxi molybdenum.
    After this old imperialist element transformed from a small timber merchant and tax collector into a "diplomatic personnel," his hound-like eyes and his spear-like beard were aimed at the Far East, at China. He was always active in China's neighboring areas such as Vladivostok in the Soviet Union and Tehran in Iran. He had also been to China several times: he had been to Shenyang 25 years ago. In order to complete the base missions given to him by his masters, he worked hard to "research" Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian.
    The U.S. government sent such a person to be stationed in Shenyang, and it had a far-reaching conspiracy.
    After arriving in Shenyang, he hired a Japanese old spy, Tani Sadaichiro, at a high price to "study Mongolian" together. He personally edited a "Mongolian Conversation." The content of "Mongolian Conversation" was the same as the "Indian Conversation," "Swedish Conversation"... that had been exposed to the world, which was prepared for use when the U.S. military invaded Mongolia. The dialogues included:
   "How far is it from here to Wangye Temple?"
   "Are there temples in your village?"
   "How many soldiers can be stationed in this temple?"…
    He also cooperated with Tani Sadaichiro to translate and edit a "Mongolian Dictionary," which was based on the "Mongolian-Russian-Japanese Dictionary" edited by the Japanese invaders. The purpose of his translation and editing of this dictionary was exactly the same as that of the Japanese invaders, to invade and control "Manchuria and Mongolia," and then to invade the whole of China and invade the Soviet Union. Of course, this was just a delusional dream.
    Ward and others were also very "interested" in the relationship between Korea and China. They instructed their pawns, Sasaki Hirotsugu, to set up strong intelligence stations in Tumen, Hunchun and other places on the Sino-Korean border to collect information on the topography and local conditions along the Yalu River.
    Just as Chekhov said: if there is a gun hanging on the stage in the first act, the gun will fire in the last act. These activities of Ward and others in the Northeast are yet another proof of the U.S. imperialist plot to launch a war of aggression in Korea.
    VI. Intelligence - News, News - Intelligence
    Under "freedom of the press," American journalists can of course freely come to Shenyang under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits. The presence of American journalists meant that people who coveted fame and fortune had arrived; it also brought opportunities for Americans in Shenyang to gain fame and fortune. They accompanied the American journalists on tours of Beiling and the Forbidden City, and sampled the special flavors of the Northeast, so that the journalists had no leisure to interview (American journalists were happy to do so). The "United States Information Service" or the "American Consulate" would hand over the "intelligence" they had collected to them, which would be turned into an American-style news story with the addition of introductory remarks such as "according to authorities on Manchurian issues" or "according to the experience of this newspaper's reporter": and then sent to the United States via the "Consulate"'s radio station or American aircraft. Sensational "news" appeared in the American newspapers, which were actually just rumors or the embodiment of "intelligence." When these American journalists left Shenyang, the "American Consulate" and the "United States Information Service" would customarily give them some Japanese women's clothing, erotic photos, opium lamps, golf clubs, etc. as "souvenirs." After sending off the American journalists, the "American Consulate" and the "United States Information Service" would immediately report this "achievement" to Washington in order to win rewards.
    VII. "The Best of the Excellent Races"
    The minds of U.S. imperialist elements are permeated with the idea of "America First"; and within "America First" there are many "Firsts," such as "diplomatic personnel" who claim to be "the most excellent Americans." Among these "most excellent Americans" there are first, second, third… ranks of Americans. The first type of American they consider to be "authentic" or "pure" Americans, that is, the Anglo-Saxon race, just like the Japanese invaders' self-proclaimed Yamato race and Hitler's German race. The second type of American is those who transferred from France and Germany to U.S. citizenship, the third type is those who transferred from Northern Europe (Denmark, Norway, etc.) to U.S. citizenship, followed by those who transferred from Japan, Australia and other places to U.S. citizenship; Chinese Americans are placed in a position similar to that of blacks and red Indians.
    Rank means power and status. The first type of American looks down on the second type and below Americans; the second type of American deeply believes that they are superior to the third type and below Americans. And so on, making the small "Consulate" full of infighting, exclusion, and foul atmosphere. Stocke, who was still an accountant when he first came to Shenyang, was not of high status, but because he was a first-type American, he often made things difficult for the head of the Information Service, Paul (because he was a German American). The second head of the Information Service, Paul, also attacked and slandered the third head of the Information Service, Cochlin. When the handover between the two terms had not yet been completed, you would lift the "Chinese antiques" placed in my office and put on your own; I would lift up what you had just put on and restore my own "antiques." The so-called "Chinese antiques" were big horse hooves, broken vases, and even portraits of Chinese folk ancestors. Therefore, Chinese employees said: "Dogs fighting make the Chinese ancestors uneasy."
    These "most excellent Americans" liked to collect "Chinese antiques" and local products. On the one hand, they could show "nobility" in China, and on the other hand, they could win the reputation of being a "China expert" after returning to the United States, and "Chinese antiques" could also be sold for a large amount of U.S. dollars. This time when Ward was expelled from China, he alone had three hundred and eighty-odd wooden boxes, suitcases, backpacks… which contained forty-three porcelain round stools used in ancient Chinese families; there were more than one hundred Chinese carpets. Ward's wife said that these things would become an incalculable amount of U.S. dollars after being brought back to the United States.
    U.S. dollars are their God. Along with U.S. dollars came social status and "honor," so every foreign national in the "Consulate" tried to make money as much as possible, and any means could be used as long as they could make money. Ward privatized the new Webster's dictionary; "Vice Consul" Stocke embezzled movie cameras and films while serving as the head of the "United States Information Service." Hickney (an Italian), a radio technician who wanted to climb up but couldn't, in order to increase his salary, did not hesitate to use his wife to hook up with Ward's secretary, Reberg, and he indeed increased his salary by twenty U.S. dollars. Reberg was even more shameless. After liberation, he privately connected wires and stole electricity, which was discovered by the People's Government Electricity Bureau. At first, he lied to his face, saying that this was allowed by the "Director of the Electricity Bureau" in the Kuomintang government era; the lie could not deceive people, and he said again that the house he lived in was originally lived in by the "U.S. Military Liaison Group," "I didn't steal electricity; the 'Liaison Group Leader' Shen Lefu stole the electricity." The staff of the People's Electricity Bureau asked him to write a letter of repentance so that he would not be fined. When he heard that he would "not be fined," he wrote a letter of repentance in his own handwriting. Until today, the letter of repentance written by this "most excellent" "American diplomat" still exists in the hands of the Chinese people whom Ward cursed as having "corruption in their blood."

    瓦尔德和他的“领事馆”
    王坪
    中国人民永远记得瓦尔德（AngusIvanWard）这个罪恶的名字。一直到今天，当姬玉衡、于永宾、房品卿、吴翰章等前“美国驻沈阳领事馆”的中国职工提到他时，恨得牙齿磨的格格直响；那些永远保存在中国人民公安机关和人民法院里的“美国间谍案”及“殴打中国工人案”的卷宗，也像活人一样，吐出了对美帝分子的有力控诉。
    这里的一字一句都像钉子钉进木头那样的真实可靠。
    从这个记载，可以使人联想到美国的一切。因为这个小小“领事馆”中所发生的事情，实质上可以反映整个的美国。
    这样的国度，这样的敌人，正该引起我们的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。
    一、瓦尔德下车就撒野
    “总领事”瓦尔德走起路来飞快。美式大皮鞋在地上格登格登响。一九四七年三月末，瓦尔德“专车抵沈”就任时，下了火车就迈开大步走过恭立两旁迎候的蒋匪官员行列。脚夫老杨来不及躲开，便成为瓦尔德初到沈阳试踢大皮鞋的肉靶子。第二天，瓦尔德又鞭打了中国马车夫。因为载着瓦尔德行装的马车在上斜坡时车夫赶马用力拉，瓦尔德便将马鞭子夺过来，朝着车夫的肩膀重重的打了几下，并且问：
    “痛吗？”
    “怎么不痛呢？”
    “那吗你为什么打马？你打马我就打你！”
    这是帝国主义分子兽性的暴露。瓦尔德太太依耳玛不准用坏了的鸡蛋臭了的鱼去喂她的爱猫，却要留着给中国工人吃；天津美军司令部规定吉普车碰死一条驴子赔美金十三元；碰死一个中国人只赔十元……这都是同出一辙的。
    瓦尔德与一切帝国主义分子一样，极端瞧不起中国人。他骂中国人“血液里便有贪污、肮脏的成份；一出娘胎便不诚实。”他经常用“Bastard！”“（杂种！”）“God Damned！”（直译是“上帝咒你！”等于中国话“混蛋！”）；甚至用美国语言中最下流的句子“Son of the bitch！”（“婊子的儿子！”）来辱骂中国人。
    二、“狗领事”胡贝德
    “领事馆”上上下下的人都怕残暴成性的瓦尔德；只有一个人不怕他，而且他还有几分怕这个人。
    这个人是他的下属“领事”胡贝德（Fred H.Hubbard）。
    胡贝德是干什么的？
    他是美国特务头子胡佛所主持的“联邦调查局”的角色。到中国后，在罪恶滔天的“中美合作所”担任训练蒋匪特务的教官。用无声手枪在昆明刺杀李公朴、闻一多两先生的特务，及在香港暗杀杨杰先生的齐玉麟，以及在长春的血尸案、重庆、贵阳的大屠杀案的特务都是在“中美合作所”训练出来的。
    胡贝德在“领事馆”是“调查报告组”的负责人。军事政治是他“调查报告”的主要对象。他的房子里阴气森森，又长又大的布幔下面是标着各种记号的军用地图。中国工人进他的房子扫地擦桌子时，如果多呆几分钟就会飞来奇祸。因为他时刻不离那条大黄狗，而他干的又是猎犬式的勾当，中国工人便在背后称他为“狗领事”。
    三、对中国职员的侮辱
    在美国，所有的公务员都要在效忠美国政府的“忠诚书”上签名，有的还要宣誓。这种“高度的民主作风”也由美国的外交官们带到各国的“领事馆”。中国当然不会例外。
    进美国“领事馆”或“美国新闻处”工作的中国人，无论是工作人员或工役，必须经过可靠的人介绍，并经过调查研究，被认为政治上和思想上没有问题才能采用。进门的第一件事就是签定一张“履历表”，要填写（回答）三十二个问题：要将姐夫、小姨子、表姐、表弟的姓名、住址、职业都写得清清楚楚。他们并规定在任何情况下不许罢工（但在美国的宪法上并没有限制工人的罢工。当有人问起瓦尔德时，他说：“在美国政府办事的是公务员不是工人！”）。不签字是不能就职的，连打扫厕所的工役也得在上面打个手印。另外还有一种表，要在上面填写在社会上“有地位”的五个保证人，保证工作者在政治上、思想上、工作上不会发生问题。
    这种表在一两年后就要重填一次。当一九四八年春，人民解放军在东北地区胜利出击、沈阳紧急、美国反共气焰高涨的时候，“领事馆”的中国职工都被叫了去，每人自备照片两张，在胡贝德等的监视下，填写一份“不得反对美国政府的宣誓书”，每人都需在表上打下十个手指的指纹。其形式的严重，有如美国电影上所夸张表现出来的对付江洋大盗的场面。
    即使是这样，瓦尔德仍然是处处防范和仇视着中国人。他常常会突如其来地对中国职员发出一些奇怪的问话：“你对美国政府的认识怎样？”“国民党政权和共产党政权你认为谁好？”骤不及防的答案便是构成你某一次“过错”的内幕原因。在调查中国职工的思想方面，瓦尔德的太太依耳玛，就像任何一个美国外交官的太太一样，成为最有力的助手。她会用她的长舌头来诱发你讲话，你偶发的话语成为她哓舌的好材料。有些老实的中国职工常常认为依耳玛“好说话、喜欢说话”，便想从她的嘴里满足一种下意识的好奇欲望，结果正好上当。
    沈阳解放以后，瓦尔德“突然发问”的作风更厉害了。因为他发现中国职工越变越“可怕”，越变越使他不安；他每次“突然发问”的结果确实证明了这一点。当一九四九年“五一”大游行时，街头上锣鼓喧天，欢声雷动，他突然问一个递给他一件东西的中国职员：
        “今天很热闹吧？”
        这位中国职员没有理他。
        他干脆叫着这位中国职员的名字问：
        “你很高兴吧？”
        “是的。今天有人很高兴，也有人很不高兴。”这是他得到的回答。这回答是过去从来没有过的“粗鲁”。
    四、“慈善”的面貌、狠毒的心肠
    沈阳解放以前，南京“美国大使馆”寄来一份“文化参赞”慕尔伯所拟定的调查表，要沈阳的外交人员胡克时（ＦＯＸ）调查一下东北文化教育的“情况”，说作为美国某“慈善团体”及某“大慈善家”“救济”的根据。调查的问题有二十多个，前面三分之一的问题是“伙食如何？”“图书缺少什么？”……；后面三分之二的问题是：“你对中国的出路看法如何？”“你认为‘戡乱’前途如何？”“美国对华政策你满意吗？”“南京政府的措施你有何意见？”……
    这是做思想情报。是通过文化教育界来了解东北人民的思想动态，以作为制订帮助国民党反动政府进一步压迫人民达到美帝奴役中国的政策的材料。
    还有一次——当北宁路已经被我人民解放军截断，沈阳解放在即的时候。瓦尔德的情报已经确知蒋匪不日就垮台，他突然用电话通知“总司令”卫立煌，要他立刻调“全东北”的“铁路局长”到“领事馆”来，说是“中美经济合作总署”有重要“委托”。五位伪局长费了老大的劲（因为铁路被我截断，交通很困难。于清晨八时准时赶到“领事馆”。里面传出话来：“‘总领事’有重要会议，叫你们在楼下等一等。”一等就是一两点钟。楼上的重要会议开完了，五位“局长”诚惶诚恐的去见“总领事”，他道貌岸然的说：
    “经合总署准备从美国拨来大批枕木、铁轨，以及其他重要铁路器材，以帮助恢复东北铁路。现在请你们把各局现存的枕木、铁轨，以及其他重要铁路器材详细开列出来，好按需要调拨。”
    这样，美国特务便掌握了东北铁路材料的情报。而这是预先布置下破坏中国人民革命事业的阴谋的一部分，因为事隔不久，东北全境便彻底解放了。
    五、“旅行”与“研究”
    在国民党匪帮统治时期，南京“美国大使馆”的武官郎霭格、伯劳特雷等和瓦尔德、史笃克辈很喜欢“旅行”。本溪、抚顺、辽阳、锦州各地的战线和工厂是他们的“旅行”目标。有一位叫芮克的武官，“深入旅行”到人民解放军长春外围的防线，正用他的了望镜站在吉普车上“观赏风景”时被人民解放军俘虏了。瓦尔德本人对抚顺、鞍山特别感到“兴趣”，前后去“旅行”过五次，并且用几个日本法西斯残余分子专门为他整理抚顺煤、鞍山铁、锦西钼的埋藏量、最高产量、年产量、机械设备等“资料”。
    这个老帝国主义分子从他脱离贩卖木材的小商人及收税人员的生涯，变成“外交人员”后，他的那双猎犬似的眼睛，那撮矛头似的胡须，便是朝着远东，朝着中国的。他总是在中国的邻近地带如苏联的海参崴、伊朗的德黑兰等地活动。他并且几次来过中国：二十五年前还到过沈阳。为了很好完成主子给他的卑劣任务，他努力“研究”俄文、中文、蒙古文。
    美国政府派这样一个人来驻沈阳，是有其深远阴谋的。
    到沈阳后，他用重金聘请一位日本老特务谷贞一郎与他共同“研究蒙文”。他亲自编辑了一本《蒙古语会话》。《蒙古语会话》的内容与已经被世人所揭穿的《印度语会话》、《瑞典语会话》……一样，是准备美军侵略到了蒙古时应用的。对话中有：
   “这里到王爷庙多远？”
   “你们这屯子里有庙宇吗？”
   “这个庙宇可驻多少兵？”……
    他又与谷贞一郎合作翻译和编辑了一本《蒙文辞典》，这辞典是以日本侵略者所编辑的《蒙露和大辞典》为蓝本。他翻译和编辑这部辞典的目的与日本侵略者完全一样，是为了侵略和控制“满蒙”，并进而侵略全中国和侵略苏联。当然，这只不过是一种狂妄的梦想。
    对于朝鲜和中国的关系，瓦尔德等也很有“兴趣”。他们曾指示他们的爪牙佐佐木弘经在中朝边境的图们、珲春等地设立强有力的情报站，搜集鸭绿江沿岸的地形民情等情报。
    正像契诃夫说的：第一幕的舞台上挂得有枪，最后一幕时枪就要打响。瓦尔德等在东北的这些活动，正是美帝在朝鲜发动侵略战争的预谋的又一证明。
    六、情报——新闻，新闻——情报
    在“新闻自由”下，美国记者当然可以自由到国民党匪帮统治下的沈阳。美国记者的光临，那就是说：贪图名利的人来了；同时也给沈阳的美国人带了获取名利的机会。他们陪伴着美国记者游逛北陵、故宫，尝尝东北的特殊口味，使得记者先生没有闲情去采访（美国记者们也乐得这么干）。“美国新闻处”或“美国领事馆”便把平素搜集的“情报”交给他们，经他们加一些“据满洲问题权威人士谈称”或“据本社记者亲历采访”之类的导语，变成一条美国式的新闻：再用“领事馆”的电台或美国飞机发往美国。美国的报上便出现了耸人听闻的“新闻”，实际上尽是谣言或“情报”的化身。这些美国记者离开沈阳时，“美国领事馆”和“美国新闻处”照例要馈赠一点日本女人的衣服、春宫照片、大烟灯、高尔夫球棒之类以作“纪念”。送走了美国记者后，“美国领事馆”和“美国新闻处”紧接着便向华盛顿报告这次“功绩”，以博得奖赏。
    七、“优秀人种中的优秀人”
    美帝分子头脑中浸透了“美国第一”的思想；而“美国第一”中又分出了很多“第一”，例如“外交人员”就自命为是“第一优秀的美国人”。在这“第一优秀的美国人”中又分出第一、第二、第三……等级的美国人。第一种美国人他们认为是“地道的”或称“纯粹的”美国人，即盎格鲁撒克逊族，这和日寇自称的大和民族，希特勒口中的日尔曼民族一样。第二种美国人是法国和德国转入美国籍的人，第三种是北欧（丹麦、挪威等国）转入美国籍的人，其次是日本、澳洲等地转入美国籍的人；美籍中国人放在和黑人和红种人差不多的地位。
    等级意味着权力、地位。第一种美国人瞧不起第二种及其以下的美国人；第二种美国人深以为自己优越于第三种及其以下的美国人。如此等等，弄得小小“领事馆”中互相倾轧、排斥，乌烟瘴气。新来沈阳时还是会计的史笃克地位不高，因为是第一种美国人，便常常刁难地位比他高的新闻处长傅保罗（因为他是美籍德人）。第二任新闻处长傅保罗又与第三任新闻处长高克兰互相攻讦，在两任交替尚未办清手续的时候，你把我放在办公室中“中国古董”掀开，摆上自己的；我又把你刚摆上的掀开，恢复自己的“古董”。所谓“中国古董”，就是大马蹬、破花瓶，其中还有中国民间的祖宗画像。所以中国职工说：“狗打架弄得中国的祖宗也不安宁。”
    这些“第一优秀的美国人”很喜欢搜罗“中国古董”和土产，一方面是在中国时可以显示“清高”，另方面回到美国后可以博得一个“中国通”的美名，而且“中国古董”还可以卖大量美金。这次瓦尔德被赶出中国国境，他一个人就有三百八十几个木头箱子和皮箱、背囊……其中装有四十三个中国古老家庭中用的磁器圆凳；有一百多条中国地毯。瓦尔德的太太说，这些东西带回美国便会变成不可估计的美金。
    美金是他们的上帝。随着美金而来的便是社会地位与“荣誉”，因此，“领事馆”中每一个外籍人都尽可能设法弄钱，只要弄到钱，什么手段都可以使用。瓦尔德将公家的新的韦氏大字典收归私有；“副领事”史笃克在“美国新闻处”处长任上把电影机和电影片充私。想往上爬又爬不起来的电台技师希克尼（意大利人）为了达到增加薪水的目的，不惜利用自己的老婆与瓦尔德的秘书雷贝格勾勾搭搭，果然增加了二十元美金。雷贝格更不要脸，他在解放后私接电线，盗用电流，被人民政府电业局查出来。在先他当面撒谎，说这是国民党政府时代的“电力局长”允许他这样干的；谎言骗不了人，又说他住的房子原为“美军联络团”住的，“我没有偷电；偷电是‘联络团长’沈乐甫。”人民电业机关的工作人员要他写个悔过书便可不罚款，他听说“不罚款”，便亲笔写了个悔过书，直到今天，这位“第一优秀”的“美国外交官”所写的悔过书，还存在被瓦尔德咒骂为“血液里便有着贪污成分”的中国人手里。
