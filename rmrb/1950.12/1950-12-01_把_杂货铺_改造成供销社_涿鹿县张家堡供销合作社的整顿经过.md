Establishing and improving supply and marketing cooperatives is an important task in rural areas today. Zhangjiabao Village in Zhuolu County, Chahar Province, has successful experience in rectifying its supply and marketing cooperative.

The Zhangjiabao Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhuolu County was once a "general store" detached from the masses, solely for profit. Everything in the cooperative was monopolized by a few cadres. The prices of goods were higher than market prices. Cadres arbitrarily extended credit, embezzled funds, leading to significant losses. The masses were dissatisfied, and the cooperative was on the verge of collapse. Later, after rectification and transformation, it became a cooperative serving the masses, thus winning the support and love of its members and gradually developing.

The Zhangjiabao Village Cooperative was established in January of this year when the county cooperative mobilized the masses to invest in shares with rice straw when purchasing rice straw for the Xuanhua Paper Mill. At that time, each share was valued at ten catties of millet, raising a total of 9,180 catties of millet and recruiting 918 members. The members elected eighteen representatives, a director, an accountant, and a salesperson, and the cooperative was considered established. At that time, the business operations and operating principles were not discussed by the members but decided by a few cadres, such as the village branch secretary and the village cooperative director. The operating principle was "as long as it's profitable." Therefore, the goods sold were things that were not urgently needed by the masses, such as soap, cigarettes, envelopes, stationery, toothpaste, and toothbrushes, while urgently needed items such as cloth, cotton, and oat flour were in short supply. The profit margin was targeted at 30% or more. For example, salt was priced at 1,200 yuan per catty on the market, the county cooperative supplied it to them at 1,100 yuan, but they sold it for 1,900 yuan; soap was 1,500 yuan per bar on the market, while the village cooperative charged 2,400 yuan; other items such as towels and oat flour were all 20% to 40% higher than market prices. Therefore, members preferred to buy from private merchants rather than from the cooperative. The village cooperative's average daily turnover was only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Although the profit margin was high, it was not enough to cover expenses. In addition, more than ten cooperative cadres and other cadres had debts and loans amounting to over 4,000 catties of millet, and some people took goods without recording them. By the end of May, the cooperative had lost 1,760 catties of millet, leaving only 800 catties.

Although the cooperative had many problems, it had not held a single representative meeting in four or five months, let alone a members' meeting. The accounts were only calculated once in February, and neither announced to the members nor reported to the county cooperative. Seeing the cooperative in a mess, members demanded to withdraw their shares, but the cooperative refused to allow it. Members were very dissatisfied and said, "Let's just throw away these ten catties of millet!" The relationship between the cooperative and its members gradually deteriorated, and later even a meeting of member representatives could not be convened. The county cooperative's leadership over the village cooperative had always been bureaucratic, believing that the establishment of the village cooperative meant that everything was fine, ignoring the work of the village cooperative, and not even responding to the letter from the member representatives requesting rectification of the cooperative.

By the end of May, the village cooperative was on the verge of collapse. The county cooperative felt the situation was serious and decided to conduct rectification.

On June 11, the county cooperative sent three cadres to Zhangjiabao. They first convened a meeting of member representatives. The meeting was held hastily, only explaining that the county cooperative wanted to rectify the village cooperative, but how to rectify it was not well studied. They simply instructed the village cooperative cadres to clear the accounts. As a result, the cadres only took one day to settle the accounts and announced them at the meeting of member representatives. At that time, three representatives raised objections: first, how was the price difference between members and non-members determined? Second, how much was sold to members and non-members respectively? Third, why were there losses despite the large profit margin? Village branch secretary Ke Yongkuan did not properly answer the members' questions but explained the losses as "excessive transportation costs." The members were very dissatisfied and discussed among themselves. Some village cadres pointed out that the losses were unreasonable, and some members pointed out discrepancies in the sales figures. At this time, the county cooperative cadres did not properly mobilize the masses to discuss and study how to deal with the situation but simply stated: "If it can't be settled here, go to the county cooperative to settle it." When member representatives raised objections, Ke Yongkuan said, "You only invested a few shares!" rejecting the members' opinions. Thus, the rectification work came to a standstill.

The county cooperative studied the reasons for the failure of the rectification and decided that the rectification needed to start with the cadres. The second rectification began in late June. First, the village branch convened a meeting of party members, criticizing Ke Yongkuan, the branch secretary, for his undemocratic style. Ke Yongkuan made a self-criticism, admitting that he not only monopolized and substituted for the village cooperative but also borrowed and extended credit for more than 100 catties of millet without recording it. He expressed his willingness to correct his mistakes. At the same time, party members questioned the cadres' practice of borrowing without recording. Then, meetings of member groups were convened, and two irresponsible representatives were removed. Based on the members' request to clear the accounts, three people were elected to form an account clearing committee. In five days, they found 1,065 catties of unrecorded "black accounts," reducing the previous losses of 1,700 catties to 695 catties. Another meeting of member representatives was convened, and the village cooperative cadres seriously reported the accounts again. Ke Yongkuan also repaid 303 catties of millet in arrears at the meeting. Under this influence, other cadres began to repay their debts, recovering 2,091 catties of millet in five days. Village cooperative director Wang Cunsheng and others made self-criticisms at the meeting of member representatives, expressing their determination to correct their mistakes. The members accepted this request and did not re-elect him. In order to strengthen future management, three representatives were elected by the members to form a supervisory committee, responsible for checking and supervising the work of the village cooperative. Various systems such as settlement, reporting, and meetings were also stipulated. In order to make the cooperative's business adapt to the needs of the members, meetings of member representatives and member groups were successively convened. According to everyone's opinions, it was decided: first, to rectify the items that were not suitable for the needs of the members. Second, the village cooperative should regularly send someone to each natural village to solicit opinions on the items needed by the members. Third, in terms of the variety of goods operated, cloth, cotton, oil, salt, agricultural tools, and other goods should be the main items, with fewer non-essential items sold, and the profit margin should be reduced from 35% to 6% to 8%.

After this rectification, the village cooperative's sales volume increased greatly. For example, the sales volume in July reached more than 15.49 million yuan (excluding consignment sales for trading companies and county cooperatives), an increase of more than tenfold compared to the average daily turnover of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan before the rectification. The cooperative's prestige began to be established. Members reflected, "This time it's not a cadres' cooperative anymore, we can also manage it!" Therefore, farmers from neighboring villages also came to the village cooperative to invest in shares. Now the number of members has increased from 918 in the past to 1,322.

### 把“杂货铺”改造成供销社  涿鹿县张家堡供销合作社的整顿经过

    把“杂货铺”改造成供销社
    涿鹿县张家堡供销合作社的整顿经过
    建立与健全供销合作社，是目前农村中一个重要工作。察哈尔涿鹿县张家堡村在整顿供销社的工作上，有成功的经验。
    涿鹿县张家堡村的供销合作社，曾经是一个单纯为了营利的脱离群众的“杂货铺”。社中一切，为少数干部包办。货物的价钱比市价高。干部任意赊欠、贪污，以致亏损很多，群众不满，眼看着就要垮台。后来经过整顿改造，变成为群众服务的合作社，因而受到社员的拥护爱戴，逐渐得到发展。
    张家堡村合作社，是今年一月间县社给宣化造纸厂收购稻草时，动员群众以稻草入股建立的。当时每股股金折小米十斤，共收股金小米九千一百八十斤，吸收社员九百十八人。由社员选出十八个代表、一个主任、一个会计、一个业务员，合作社就算建立起来。当时对于经营什么业务和按什么原则经营，都没有经过社员讨论，只由该村的支部书记和村社主任等少数干部决定。营业的原则是“只要能赚钱就行”。因此所售的货就是些肥皂、纸烟、信封、信纸、牙刷、牙粉等不是群众迫切需要的东西，而群众迫切需要的东西如布、棉、莜面等却为数很少。卖东西看利在百分之三十以上。如食盐每斤市价一千二百元，县社给他们是一千一百元，他们却卖一千九百元；肥皂每条市价一千五百元，村社是二千四百元；其他如毛巾、莜面等都比市价高百分之二十到四十。因此，社员宁肯到私商那里买，也不去合作社买。村社每日平均营业额只有三、四万元。看利虽大、仍不够开支。此外，合作社干部和其他干部十多人赊账、借款就折米四千多斤，还有些人取货没有记账的。五月底，合作社赔了一千七百六十斤米，亏的仅剩下八百多斤米。
    合作社虽然出了许多毛病，四、五个月里却没有开过一次代表会，更不用说社员大会了。账目只在二月份算了一次，既没有向社员公布，也没有向县社报告。社员眼看合作社搞个一团糟，便要求退股，但合作社不给退。社员非常不满地说：“白扔了这十斤米吧！”合作社与社员的关系逐渐不好，后来连个社员代表会也召集不起来。县社对村社的领导一贯存在着官僚主义，认为村社成立就算万事大吉，对村社的工作不闻不问，对社员代表要求整顿合作社的信也没有答理。
    五月底，村社快要垮台。县社觉得情况严重，便决定进行整顿。
    六月十一日县社派了三个干部到张家堡。首先召开一个社员代表会。会议开的很潦草，只说明县社要整顿村社，至于如何整顿，没有很好研究，只是简单的布置叫村社干部清理账目。结果，干部只一天就把账结算出来，在社员代表会上公布。当时有三个代表提出意见：第一、社员与非社员价格是怎样分的？第二、卖给社员和非社员各多少？第三、利钱很大为什么还要赔钱？村支书柯永宽对社员提出的意见，没有很好答复，只把赔本解释为“运费太大”。社员很不满意，议论纷纷。有的村干部提出亏损的太没有道理，有的社员提出进销数字不符。这时县社干部没有很好发动群众讨论，研究怎样处理，只是提出：“这里算不清到县社算。”社员代表提意见，柯永宽就说：“你们才入几个股！”把社员的意见顶回去。于是整顿工作成为僵局。
    县社研究整社失败的原因，决定整社需要从干部着手。六月下旬开始第二次整社。首由村支部召开党员大会，对支书柯永宽不民主的作风提出批评。柯永宽进行了检讨，承认自己对村社不只包办代替，而且借款、赊货有一百多斤小米没有记账。愿意改正错误。同时党员对干部借款不记账的作法提出质问。接着召开社员小组会，罢免了两个不负责的代表。又根据社员提出清理账目的要求，推选三个人成立清算账目委员会。五天中查出没记账的“黑账”一千零六十五斤米，使曾经赔本的一千七百多斤米，降为六百九十五斤。又召开社员代表会，村社干部重新认真报告了账目。柯永宽在会上还了三百零三斤米的欠账。在此影响下，其他的干部都开始归还欠账，五天收回外欠小米二千零九十一斤。村社主任王存胜等在社员代表会上作了自我检讨，表示决心改正错误。社员们接受了这一要求，未曾把他改选。为了加强今后的管理工作，由社员选举出三个代表成立了监事会，负责检查督促村社的工作。又规定了结账、报告、会议等各种制度。为了使合作社的业务能够适应社员的需要，相继召开了社员代表会和社员小组会。根据大家的意见，决定：第一，把不适合社员需要的东西加以整顿。第二，村社经常有一个人到各自然村征求社员需要东西的意见。第三，在经营货物的品种上，以布、棉、油、盐、农具等货为主，少售非必需品，利润由百分之三十五降为百分之六至百分之八。
    村社经过这一次整顿，销货额大增。如七月份销货额就达一千五百四十九万多元（给贸易公司和县社代销除外），比整顿前每日平均营业额三、四万元增加十余倍。合作社的威信开始树立起来。社员们反映说：“这回可不是干部社了，我们也可以管啦！”因此邻村农民也来村社入股。现在社员由过去的九百十八人增加到一千三百二十二人。
