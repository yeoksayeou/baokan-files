Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th, TASS: The *Red Star* newspaper, in an article commenting on the Korean War situation, pointed out the victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The author of the article stated: The American and South Korean troops are continuing to retreat southward, and the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are pursuing them closely. MacArthur has ordered his headquarters to prohibit the provision of any news regarding the war's developments to newspaper and news agency reporters. However, the bourgeois newspapers do not conceal that the majority of the fleeing American troops are concentrated in the Seoul area. Thus, since the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched their counter-offensive on November 25th, the American and South Korean troops have been driven southwards on several fronts, retreating nearly 250 to 300 kilometers.

The commentator wrote: The victorious offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has attracted the attention of all foreign newspapers. Military journalists and commentators in foreign newspapers are racking their brains to find the reasons for the victories of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The commentator said: These reasons are very clear. Because the Korean People's Army is waging a just war of liberation against the American aggressors. They are defending their country, defending their people. The Chinese People's Volunteers, while assisting their Korean brothers and protecting their borders from violation, have repelled the arrogant American aggressors who infringed upon the freedom and independence of great China. This is the main source of strength for the Korean People's Army, and it is the fundamental reason for their victory. The reasons for the victories of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers can also be explained by skillful military operations. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, when conducting offensives, firmly maintain the initiative and skillfully utilize close combat and hand-to-hand combat, which is precisely what the American soldiers are trying to avoid.

    苏红星报评朝鲜战局
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：“红星报”在评朝鲜战局一文中，指出朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的胜利。该文作者称：美军和南朝鲜军正在继续向南退却，人民军和中国人民志愿军正在跟踪追击。麦克阿瑟已下令禁止他的总部向报纸和通讯社的记者供给关于战事发展的任何消息。但资产阶级报纸并不隐瞒南逃的美军大部集中在汉城地区。这样，自十一月二十五日人民军和中国人民志愿军发动反攻以来，美军和南朝鲜军在若干线上已被逐向南后退了将近二百五十至三百公里。
    评论员写道：朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军的胜利进攻，吸引了所有外国报纸的注意。军事记者和外国报纸的评论员们都费尽脑筋想找到人民军和中国志愿军胜利的原因。评论员说：这些原因是十分明白的。因为朝鲜人民军是对美国侵略者进行正义的解放战争。他们是在保卫他们的国家，保卫他们的人民。中国人民志愿军一面协助他们的朝鲜兄弟，一面保卫他们边境的不受侵犯，已经击退了侵犯伟大中国的自由与独立的自负的美国侵略者。这是朝鲜人民军力量的主要源泉，也是它取得胜利的基本原因。人民军和中国志愿军胜利的原因，也可以从巧妙的军事行动中得到解释。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在进行攻势时，稳固地保持着主动，干练地运用了近战和肉搏战，而这正是美国兵所力图避免的。
