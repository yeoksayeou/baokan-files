    Strive to Become a New Type of Intellectual
    ——Introducing Learning Model Li Guanxi
    Tangshan Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department
    Comrade Li Guanxi is a Communist Party member of peasant origin. With the help of the CCP Changli County and District Committees, and after ten months of arduous study, he has learned to recognize 1,100 characters and can write letters and simple work reports. As a result, he has won the title of learning model for the entire district and has been commended by the CCP Tangshan Prefectural Committee and the Changli County Committee.
    Comrade Li Guanxi was initially not very enthusiastic about learning culture, emphasizing that he was too old (30 years old this year) and could not learn. In the first half of last year, he only learned a little more than 100 characters. In October last year, he was transferred to Changli First District as an agricultural assistant, and in his work, he deeply felt the pain of being illiterate. He regretted not working hard to learn in the past. In January this year, the District Committee reorganized the study, criticized the erroneous idea that "workers and peasants have no future," and introduced many vivid facts about worker and peasant cadres who were learning models in the newspapers. The District Study Committee also helped him make a study plan, asking him to insist on learning five or six new characters every day. As a result of his persistence, by March this year, he had learned more than 500 characters. At that time, the District Committee appointed him as the leader of a small work team, requiring him to grasp the work reports from the villages. Initially, he could only read but not write, and all work reports had to be written for him by a village cadre from Datianzhuang, but people were very busy with production, and often delayed their own work because of writing reports. Later, every time he asked someone to write a report, he would copy it twice in the same way, and after more than 20 times, he could write simple reports himself. If there were characters he didn't know how to write, he would leave them blank for the time being and then ask someone to fill them in.
    Li Guanxi's perseverance in learning is praised by everyone. He insisted on learning anytime, anywhere. If he didn't learn five or six new characters in a day, he would definitely make up for it the next day. He once said, "Every day is not wasted, and you gain something for every character you learn." At the same time, he is eager to ask questions. He often said, "If you ask questions with your mouth and write diligently with your hands, you are sure to succeed!" After going to the countryside, he often went to school to listen to classes when it did not interfere with his work. Once, while helping an old man "stir fertilizer," he went to school during a break to learn the three characters "stir," "fertilizer," and "hoe." Initially, his process of learning to recognize characters was to memorize them by rote, but as the days went by, he easily forgot them. Later, he would draw pictures according to the meaning of the characters, such as drawing a picture of a big green onion next to the character "葱" (green onion). Later, as he recognized more characters, he used familiar characters to mark the pronunciation to help him remember. He also stipulated that he would check what he had learned in three days, seven days, half a month, or a month, so that he would not easily forget.
    Now the comrades working in the district have all put forward the slogan of learning from him. He is also very enthusiastic about helping others learn. He often says, "Under the cultivation of the Party, I strive to become a new type of intellectual!"

    争取当个新型的知识分子
    ——介绍学习模范李冠玺
    唐山地委宣传部
    李冠玺同志是个农民出身的共产党员。他在中共昌黎县、区委的帮助下，经过十个月的艰苦学习，已认识了一千一百个字，能写信和作简单工作报告，因此，获得了全区学习模范的称号，受到了中共唐山地委和昌黎县委的通报表扬。
    李冠玺同志最初对学习文化不大起劲，强调自己岁数大了（今年三十岁）。不能学习。他去年上半年只学会了一百多个字。去年十月调他到昌黎一区任农业助理员，工作中他深深地感到不识字的痛苦。悔恨自己过去不肯努力学习。今年一月间区委重新整顿学习，批评了“工农干部没前途”的错误思想，并介绍了报纸上很多工农干部学习模范的生动事实，区学委会并帮助他做了学习计划。要他每天坚持学五、六个生字。他坚持下来的结果，到今年三月他就学会了五百多个字。当时区委让他担任小片工作组长，要掌握村里的工作汇报，起初他只会看，不会写，一切工作汇报都得求大田庄一个村干部来替他写，但人家生产很忙，常因为写汇报耽误了自己的工作。后来他就在每次求人写好汇报之后，照样地抄写两遍，经过了二十多次，自己就能写简单的报告了，遇有不会写的字，便暂先留下空白然后再求人给填写。
    李冠玺同志学习的恒心是人人称赞的。他随时随地都坚持学习，如果一天学不到五、六个生字，第二天一定得补上。他曾说：“天天不空过，学一个得一个。”同时，他好问。他常说：“嘴勤常问，手勤常写，那怕不成功！”他下乡后，在不妨碍工作的情况下，常到学校去听课。有一次帮助老乡“捣粪”，休息的时候他就到学校去学会了“捣粪”和“锄”三个生字。最初他学认字过程，是用硬记的方法，可是日子多了，就容易忘掉。后来他就照字意画上图画，如“葱”就在字旁画一棵大葱的样子。后来字认多了，就拿熟字来注音帮助记忆。并规定在三天、七天、半月或一月检查自己所学的东西，这样就不容易忘记了。
    现在区里的工作同志们都提出了向他看齐的口号。他也很热心地去帮助别人学习。他常说：“我在党的培养下，争取当个新型的知识分子！”
