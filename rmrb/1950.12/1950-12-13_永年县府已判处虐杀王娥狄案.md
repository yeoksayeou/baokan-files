Reaction to Criticism from the People's Daily

To the Editors:

We believe the criticism in Zhan Gui's article, "Unable to Endure Abuse from Mother-in-Law and Husband, Wang E'di Forced to Commit Suicide; County and District Should Strengthen Marriage Law Promotion," published in the "People's Garden" on June 28th, was correct. In addition to seriously addressing this case, we have also inspected the work of promoting the Marriage Law.

After the case occurred, we promptly conducted an investigation and survey. Later, in order to deal with this case seriously, we conducted another investigation. Now the facts of the case have been clarified, and the case was adjudicated on September 7th. The defendants who abused Wang E'di, as well as the relevant village cadres, have been given due punishment according to the severity of their responsibilities. Defendant Zheng Gao'shi consistently abused her daughter-in-law Wang E'di and often instigated her son Zheng Hongsheng to beat and scold Wang E'di, forcing Wang E'di to commit suicide by throwing herself into a well. She should bear the main responsibility for forcing Wang E'di to her death and is therefore sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Defendant Zheng Hongsheng, following the instigation of his mother Zheng Gao'shi, jointly abused Wang E'di, resulting in her suicide, and is sentenced to three years of imprisonment. Zhang Hui's adultery with Zheng Gao'shi deepened Zheng Gao'shi's hatred of Wang E'di, which was also a reason Wang E'di was forced to commit suicide, so he is sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Zheng Shenghua did not offer any advice when Wang E'di was being abused, but instead added to the momentum by shouting and hitting. Dong Nuo'de and Zheng Bao'de (village cadres) restricted Wang E'di from divorcing, which also had a considerable impact on Wang E'di's suicide. After being detained and educated for more than a month, they showed repentance and were given education and released separately.

At the same time, we found that the previous publicity and education on the Marriage Law was not sufficient. Some district and village cadres still have a poor understanding of the Marriage Law, and therefore cannot effectively grasp the marriage policy. In order to enable them to have a sufficient understanding of the Marriage Law, we have planned to strengthen the publicity work of the Marriage Law, such as conducting lectures at various meetings, arranging for district cadres to study the Marriage Law, and widely publicizing it to the masses. We must continue to strengthen this work in the future to ensure the thorough implementation of the Marriage Law.

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    永年县府已判处虐杀王娥狄案编辑同志：
    六月二十八日《人民园地》刊登的展圭同志所写《不堪婆婆丈夫虐待，王娥狄被逼自杀，县区应加强婚姻法宣传》的批评，我们认为是正确的。我们除对这个案件进行严正处理外，并对婚姻法的宣传工作，进行了检查。
    该案发生后，我们便及时进行勘验调查。后来为了严正处理这一案件，我们又再次进行调查。现在案情已经弄清，该案在九月七日已经判决。虐待王娥狄的各被告及有关村干部都已分别责任大小受到应得处分。被告郑高氏一贯虐待子媳王娥狄，并经常教唆其子郑鸿生打骂王娥狄，迫使王娥狄投井自杀，应负逼死王娥狄主要责任，故判处有期徒刑十年。被告郑鸿生听从其母郑高氏教唆，共同虐待王娥狄，致逼使其自杀，判处有期徒刑三年。张会的与郑高氏通奸，使郑高氏加深仇视王娥狄，亦为王娥狄被迫自杀的一个原因，故判处有期徒刑一年六个月。郑生花于王娥狄受虐待之际，不加劝解，反在旁助势喝打，董挪的、郑堡的（村干部）限制王娥狄离婚，对王娥狄自杀亦有相当影响；经扣押教育一个多月后，知所改悔，均予分别教育释放。
    同时，我们检查出以前对婚姻法的宣传教育上做得很不够，一部分区、村干部对婚姻法的认识还很差，因而不能很好掌握婚姻政策。为了使他们对婚姻法有足够认识，我们便有计划地来加强婚姻法的宣传工作，如在各种会议上进行讲解，布置区干部学习婚姻法并广泛对群众进行宣传。我们今后仍须继续加强这一工作，以保证婚姻法的彻底贯彻。
