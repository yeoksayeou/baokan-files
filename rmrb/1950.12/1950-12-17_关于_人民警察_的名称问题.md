    Regarding the Name of "People's Police"

    We have recently received letters from readers reflecting that the name "People's Police" is inconsistent across various regions. Furthermore, the word "police" has left a very bad impression among the people. In order to unify the name and strictly distinguish it from the old "police," the Central Ministry of Public Security has recently submitted a proposal to the Government Administration Council, stipulating that all types of police should be uniformly referred to as "People's Police," abbreviated as "Minjing." This name should also be uniformly used in all incoming and outgoing forms and tables.

    关于“人民警察”的名称问题
    近接读者来信反映：关于“人民警察”之名称问题，各地均不一致；且“警察”二字在人民中间遗留下很坏的印象，为统一其名称，并与旧“警察”严格区别，最近中央公安部已呈准政务院，规定将各种警察一律统称为“人民警察”，其简称为“民警”。在各种来往表册中，也应一律采用此名称。
