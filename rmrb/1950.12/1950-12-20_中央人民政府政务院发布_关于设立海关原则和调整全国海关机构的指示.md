    Instructions from the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on Establishing Customs Principles and Adjusting National Customs Institutions

    The fundamental principle for establishing customs in the People's Republic of China: it is imperative to reverse the past reactionary rule of serving imperialist economic aggression by complying with the massive dumping of foreign goods and the cheap extraction of raw materials. The previous practice of wantonly opening up foreign trade and establishing customs institutions everywhere must be replaced with a strict adherence to the spirit of independence and self-reliance. Customs institutions should be established in places where foreign trade should be opened according to the needs of the national economy. All customs posts, checkpoints, and stations that do not conform to this fundamental principle, whether they are merely monitoring smuggling or are also inspecting and levying taxes, in places where foreign trade is not open or is not needed by our economy, should be abolished in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the specific conditions of each locality, and the anti-smuggling tasks in these places should be transferred to the public security organs. To this end, the principles for establishing customs and the plan for adjusting customs institutions are stipulated as follows:

    A. Principles for Establishing Customs:

    I. Customs institutions may be established in the following places:

    1. Ports opened to foreign trade as decided by the Central People's Government;
    2. Border railway stations and international connecting railway stations;
    3. Locations on land borders and border rivers where goods and passengers are permitted to enter and exit the country;
    4. International airports;
    5. International parcel and mail exchange locations;
    6. Places where the import and export of goods are specially permitted by the Central People's Government.

    II. Customs (or Customs Houses), Sub-Customs Houses, and Branch Customs Houses shall be established according to the following conditions:

    1. Customs (or Customs Houses) shall be established in places where there are frequent large quantities of import and export goods (including international parcels and passenger baggage) or where there are frequent but smaller quantities of import and export goods (including international parcels and passenger baggage) but which are politically and economically important;
    2. Sub-Customs Houses shall be established in places where there are frequent but smaller quantities of import and export goods (including international parcels and passenger baggage);
    3. Branch Customs Houses shall be established in places where there are infrequent imports and exports of goods or where there are frequent but very small quantities or where imports and exports to foreign countries are limited.

    III. Each local Customs (or Customs House) shall be directly under the General Administration of Customs. The subordinate relationship of each Sub-Customs House and Branch Customs House shall be determined by the General Administration of Customs.

    IV. Goods are not permitted to enter or exit the country in places where there are no Customs (or Customs House), Sub-Customs House, or Branch Customs House. Violators will be treated as smugglers, and the smuggled goods, along with the means of transportation and persons involved in smuggling, shall be detained by the local public security forces or military and political organs and handled in accordance with customs regulations. In order to facilitate the exchange of essential daily necessities for self-use by ethnic minorities and residents on the border, small amounts of goods are allowed to enter and exit the border for border residents. The administrative measures shall be formulated by the financial and economic committees of each major administrative region based on the specific conditions of the border area in their respective regions, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Trade and the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government for record.

    V. The establishment, relocation, or abolition of Customs (or Customs House), Sub-Customs House, or Branch Customs House shall be handled by the General Administration of Customs in conjunction with the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government.

    VI. The anti-smuggling work in border and coastal areas where there are no Customs (or Customs House), Sub-Customs House, or Branch Customs House shall be handled by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government in accordance with the decision of this Council on January 27, 1950. The original institutions of local Customs (or Customs House) that were established solely for anti-smuggling purposes shall temporarily maintain their current status until the anti-smuggling work is transferred to the Ministry of Public Security, but shall not be regarded as places for foreign import and export trade. Existing other customs branch institutions that have not been designated to continue to exist may also temporarily handle their original business before being ordered to be abolished.

    B. Based on the above-mentioned customs establishment principles and the current situation, it has been decided to temporarily establish 26 local Customs (or Customs Houses), 9 Sub-Customs Houses, and 35 Branch Customs Houses nationwide. Their names and subordinate systems are as follows:

    Manzhouli Customs, under which is the Hailar Branch Customs House;
    Suifenhe Customs;
    Tumen Customs, under which are the Kaishantun, Sanhecun, Nanping, and Hunchun Branch Customs Houses;

    Beihai Customs, under which is the Dongxing Branch Customs House;
    Wuzhou Customs;
    Zhanjiang Customs;
    Haikou Customs;
    Kunming Customs, under which are the Daluo, Menglian, Hekou, and Maguan Branch Customs Houses;
    Tengchong Customs, under which are the Wanting Sub-Customs House and the Mengmao, Zhedao, Houqiao, and Zhenkang Branch Customs Houses;
    Dihua Customs, under which is the Horgos Sub-Customs House with the Yining Branch Customs House, the Tacheng Sub-Customs House with the Baketu Branch Customs House, the Chenghua Sub-Customs House with the Jimunai Branch Customs House, the Kashgar Sub-Customs House with the Yitang Branch Customs House, and directly under its jurisdiction are the Hami and Wusu Branch Customs Houses.

                                  Premier of the Government Administration Council Zhou Enlai

    中央人民政府政务院发布
    关于设立海关原则和调整全国海关机构的指示
    中华人民共和国设立海关的基本原则：必须一反过去反动统治为服从帝国主义大量倾销外货并廉价吸取原料的经济侵略措施，滥行开放对外贸易，到处设立海关机构的方针而严格以独立自主精神，根据国家经济情况的需要，在应开放对外贸易的地方设立海关机构。凡与这个基本原则不合的，在非开放对外贸易或为我经济情况所不需开放对外贸易的地方所设立的关、卡、所、哨等，不论其仅为监视走私或尚在查验征税，均应根据各地具体情况有计划有步骤地予以撤销，并将各该地方的查私任务移交公安机关。为此，特将设关原则和调整海关机构方案规定如下：
    甲、设关原则：
    一、下列地方得设立海关机构：
    １、中央人民政府决定开放对外贸易的港口；
    ２、国界火车站和国际联运车站；
    ３、陆路边境及国界江河上准许货物旅客出入国境的地点；
    ４、国际航空站；
    ５、国际邮包、邮件交换地点；
    ６、经中央人民政府特许货物出进口的地方。
    二、依下列条件分别设立海关（或关）、分关、支关：
    １、凡经常有大宗出进口货物（包括国际邮包及旅客行李在内）的地方或经常只有数量较少的出进口货物（包括国际邮包及旅客行李在内）但有政治经济重要性的地方，设立海关（或关）；
    ２、凡经常有数量较少的出进口货物（包括国际邮包及旅客行李在内）的地方设立分关；
    ３、凡不经常有出进口货物或经常有而数量很少或对国外出进口贸易只有局限性的地方，设立支关。
    三、各地方海关（或关）直隶于海关总署，各分关、支关的隶属关系由海关总署规定之。
    四、凡未设有海关（或关）、分关、支关的地方不准货物出进国境，违者以走私论，并由当地公安部队或军政机关将私运货物连同运输工具及走私关系人扣留，按照海关法规的规定办理之。为了照顾国界边境少数民族及居民交换自用生活必需品方便起见，允许边境居民小额货物进出。其管理办法由各大行政区财政经济委员会根据本区边境的特殊情况，拟定具体实施办法，并报中央人民政府贸易部、海关总署备查。
    五、海关（或关）、分关、支关之设立、迁移或撤销，由海关总署会同中央人民政府贸易部、财政部及公安部办理之。
    六、凡未设有海关（或关）、分关、支关之边境沿海地方查私工作，应根据本院一九五○年一月二十七日的决定由中央人民政府公安部负责办理之。各地海关（或关）原有仅为查私而设之机构在未将查私工作移交公安部以前，暂维现状，但不得视为对外出进口贸易地方。现有其他海关分支机构尚未规定继续存在者，亦得在奉令撤销前仍暂办理原有业务。
    乙、根据上述设关原则及目前情况，决定暂在全国范围内设立地方海关（或关）二六处，分关九处及支关三五处。其名称及隶属系统如下：
