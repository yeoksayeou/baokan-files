Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: French Communist leader Jacques Duclos condemned the government's agreement to rearm West Germany, undermining the Franco-Soviet treaty, and called on the people to rise up and oppose the government's treacherous actions. According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on December 12th, Duclos addressed more than 2,000 people in Brest, France, who were attending the 30th anniversary celebration of the founding of the French Communist Party. He said: The Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance stipulates that neither party shall enter into any alliance directed against the other, nor participate in any group directed against the other. The Pleven government's agreement to rearm West Germany violates the Franco-Soviet treaty, because the purpose of establishing a new German Wehrmacht is to prepare for aggression against France's ally, the Soviet Union. France's joining the Atlantic Pact (German troops will join the Atlantic Pact's army) means joining an anti-Soviet alliance, which violates the Franco-Soviet treaty.

Duclos said: The rearmament of West Germany in violation of the Franco-Soviet treaty greatly increases the danger of war. Now, the masses of the people need to take action more than ever. Patriots and participants in the Resistance movement should rise up against such a government, whose policies are a continuation of the Pétain policy.

Duclos said: In the name of the Communist Party, we call on French men and women, regardless of belief or political view, to participate in the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and the revival of Nazism. The government's violation of the Franco-Soviet treaty threatens France's security and betrays France's interests. But this cannot prevent the French people from remaining loyal to Franco-Soviet friendship—a guarantee of security and peace—nor can it prevent the people, together with Thorez, from declaring that they will never fight against the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th, Paris dispatch: The French people's tide of anger against the government's agreement to establish a West German army is surging higher and higher. On December 13th, workers in various enterprises in Marseille called for a short-term strike to protest the government's subservience to American imperialism. Factories held rallies, elected delegations to submit resolutions and petitions to the provincial authorities. One hundred and twenty-five delegations of working people broke through the police blockade and petitioned the Bouches-du-Rhône Provincial Council. Tens of thousands of Marseille residents held demonstrations.

The protest movement is also surging in other parts of France. Mass protest rallies and demonstrations have been held in many places in the Paris region, Toulon, Var, Pas-de-Calais, and Bouches-du-Rhône. Workers in various enterprises in Paris and its suburbs held short-term strikes. Many delegations of working people visited the National Assembly to protest the rearmament of West Germany.

The "Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom" issued a statement denouncing the French rulers for submitting to the United States, betraying France's interests, and betraying peace; and calling on the French people to unite and oppose the rearmament of West Germany. The French Women's Union also issued a similar statement.

    法国人民集会抗议屈从美帝国主义
    【新华社十七日讯】法国共产党领袖杜克洛谴责政府同意重新武装西德，破坏法苏条约，并号召人民起来反对政府这种卖国行径。据塔斯社巴黎十二日讯，杜克洛在法国布勒斯特城对参加法国共产党成立三十周年纪念大会的二千余人发表演说。他说：法苏同盟互助条约规定缔约双方均不得缔结反对对方的任何盟约，也不得参加反对对方的任何集团。普利文政府同意重新武装西德，就破坏了法苏条约；因为建立新的德国国防军，其目的就是准备侵略法国的盟邦苏联。法国加入大西洋集团（德国部队将加入大西洋集团军队），这就参加了反苏联盟，破坏了法苏条约。
    杜克洛说：违背法苏条约的重新武装西德，大大加强了战争危险。现在，人民群众比任何时候都更需要行动了。爱国志士和参加抵抗运动的人应该起来反对这样的政府，这政府的政策乃是贝当政策的延续。
    杜克洛说：我们以共产党的名义，号召法国男女，不分信仰与政见，参加反对重新武装西德和使纳粹主义复活的斗争。政府破坏法苏条约，使法国安全蒙受威胁，而且出卖了法国的利益。但这样毫不能阻止法国人民忠于法苏友谊——安全及和平的保障，也丝毫不能阻止人民和多列士在一起宣布：他们永远不对苏联作战。
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎讯：法国人民反对政府同意建立西德军的怒潮，正在越来越澎湃。十二月十三日，马赛各企业的工人号召举行短期罢工，抗议政府屈从美帝国主义。各工厂纷纷举行大会，选出代表团向省政当局呈递决议和请愿书。劳动人民的一百二十五个代表团冲破警察的封锁，到罗尼河口省省议会请愿。成千成万马赛居民举行示威。
    抗议运动也在法国其他地方高涨。巴黎区、土伦、瓦尔省、加来海峡省和罗尼河口省的许多地方，纷纷举行群众抗议大会和示威游行。巴黎市和近郊各企业的工人举行了短期罢工。劳动人民的许多代表团访问国民议会，抗议重新武装西德。
    “争和平自由战士协会”发表一项声明，痛斥法国统治者屈服美国，出卖法国的利益，出卖和平；并号召法国人民团结起来，反对重新武装西德。法兰西妇女联盟也发表了同样的声明。
