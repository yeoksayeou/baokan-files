Xinhua News Agency: The National Timber Conference convened by the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government on November 21st, concluded on the 26th. Representatives from relevant central departments and representatives from the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, East China, Central South Major Administrative Areas, and Shanxi and Hebei in North China attended the meeting.

Minister of Forestry and Land Reclamation, Liang Xi, gave a report to the conference. He said: Although various regions have achieved considerable success in forest protection in the past year, the phenomenon of forest destruction due to indiscriminate logging is still very serious in vast new areas. There are four main reasons for indiscriminate logging: (1) Some regions have a small number of troops engaged in logging as a production endeavor; (2) Some local governments regard forests as the only object of production for disaster relief; (3) In new areas where land reform has not been implemented, landlords collude with private merchants to wantonly destroy forests; (4) When government agencies, public enterprises, and industrial and mining departments in various places urgently need timber, they set up acquisition stations everywhere to compete for purchases, even contracting or engaging in destructive logging in the form of "contracting entire mountains" through private merchants.

Minister Liang went on to explain the current abnormal timber supply and demand relationship, saying: Because the central agencies and local departments have made overly large timber order plans with the Northeast, the Northeast now has an inventory of more than one million cubic meters of timber, which cannot be sold, causing the work of forest railways, lumber mills, and other institutions to tend towards stagnation. However, major regions and provinces within the customs are wantonly logging by contracting with merchants due to a lack of timber. Therefore, the current timber supply and demand relationship urgently needs to be adjusted. Minister Liang also reviewed the phenomenon of waste of national resources caused by unreasonable use of timber in various places. Based on Minister Liang's report, the conference held heated discussions on how to reasonably use timber, achieve a balance between timber supply and demand, implement forest protection policies, and stop unorganized indiscriminate logging. Finally, the participating representatives from various regions reached a consensus on issues such as the organization and institutions for the unified allocation of timber nationwide, the organization and management of timber merchants, the methods for logging state-owned timber, timber usage regulations, timber quotas, specifications, and measurement. They also gained a preliminary understanding of the timber demand of government agencies, public enterprises, industrial and mining departments, etc., in various regions in 1951, thereby formulating the logging tasks for major administrative regions for the next year.

    合理使用木材达到供需平衡
    全国木材会议取得一致意见
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府林垦部十一月二十一日召开的全国木材会议，已于二十六日闭幕。参加会议的有中央各有关部门代表和东北、西北、西南、华东、中南各大行政区和华北的山西、河北等地代表。
    中央林垦部梁希部长向大会作报告。他说：一年来各地区在护林方面虽已取得不少的成绩，但广大新区因滥伐而破坏森林的现象仍很严重。滥伐森林主要原因有四：（一）有些地区少数部队以伐木为生产事业；（二）某些地方政府以森林作生产救灾的唯一对象；（三）在未实行土地改革的新区，地主结合私商大肆破坏森林；（四）各地政府机关、公营企业和工矿部门在急需木材时，即到处设立收购站争相收买。甚至包揽或通过私商进行“包青山”式的破坏性的采伐。
    梁部长继就当前木材供需关系失常的现象有所说明，他说：由于中央各机关和地方各部门与东北订购木材计划做得太大，现东北已积压了木材达一百余万立方米，销不出去，使森铁、制材厂等机构的工作趋于半停顿状态。而关内各大区省却因缺乏木材纷纷包商滥伐。因此，目前木材的供需关系亟待调整。梁部长最后就各地因使用木材不合理，而造成了国家资源的浪费现象，也进行了检讨。会议根据梁部长的报告，对于如何合理使用木材，达到木材的供需平衡，贯彻护林政策，停止无组织的滥伐等问题，展开了热烈讨论。最后，各地与会代表关于全国木材统一调拨的组织与机构、木商的组织和管理，国有林木的采伐办法、木材使用条例、木材定额、规格、检尺诸问题已取得一致的意见。并初步了解了一九五一年度各地政府机关、公营企业、工矿部门等需材数量，从而拟定各大行政区明年度的采伐任务。
