    Against Re-Arming West Germany
    French People Unleash Wave of Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 14th] Paris dispatch: To oppose the Pleven government's succumbing to the will of American imperialism and supporting the re-arming of West Germany, the people of France have unleashed a wave of protest.
    On the afternoon of December 11th, many delegations of French working people and hundreds of thousands of Parisians, under the call of the French Communist Party, disregarding the French government's ban, formed a mighty petition procession to present a petition and resolutions protesting the arming of West Germany to the President. Although the French government dispatched six or seven thousand military police to deal with the petitioning masses, it could not stop the petition procession from advancing towards the Presidential Palace. When the procession arrived at the Presidential Palace, the police only allowed a very few representatives to send the petition in, and a large number of people sang "La Marseillaise" in front of the heavily surrounded Presidential Palace, shouting: "Let Pleven resign!" "Return Korea to the Koreans!" "No re-arming of West Germany!" The military police, as if facing a formidable enemy, attempted to disperse the petitioning crowd, but the masses immediately regrouped and continued to march in formation. When the procession passed the American Embassy, the American Information Service, and the British Embassy, people passionately shouted: "France belongs to the French!" "Don't give weapons to the Nazis, we want peace!"
    On December 12th, the people of Paris again responded to the call of the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party, various trade union organizations, and many democratic groups, and held demonstrations and parades throughout Paris, distributing leaflets.
    Political prisoners of France under Nazi occupation convened a national congress in Paris on the evening of the 10th to discuss how to launch a nationwide protest movement. These 8,000 representatives of people who had escaped death from Hitler's concentration camps and their families all solemnly swore: "We will do our utmost to protest against the re-arming of those who ravaged our country. Re-arming those people is an insult to our martyrs, endangers the security of France, and threatens world peace." Each delegation took back a handful of soil from the sacred places of resistance against the Nazis, such as Oradour, Auschwitz, and Vercors plateau, preparing to solemnly bury this soil, soaked with the blood of anti-Nazi fighters, in all major towns in France, to launch a protest movement against the American re-arming of West Germany.
    The executive bureau of the "National Association of Former French Interior Forces, Volunteers, and Guerrilla Soldiers" issued a resolution opposing the re-arming of West Germany, demanding a Four-Power conference to resolve the German question, and calling on people who had participated in the resistance movement in the past to unite more closely and organize resistance movement committees throughout the country.

    反对重新武装西德
    法国人民展开抗议怒潮
    【新华社十四日讯】巴黎消息：为了反对普利文政府屈从美帝国主义意旨而赞成重新武装西德，全法国人民已展开了抗议的怒潮。
    十一日下午，法国劳动人民的许多代表团和成千成万的巴黎人民，在法国共产党号召下，不顾法国政府的禁令，组成了浩浩荡荡的请愿队伍，向总统呈递抗议武装西德的请愿书与决议案。虽然法国政府出动了六七千名军警来对付请愿群众，但是并不能阻止请愿队伍向总统府前进。当队伍到达总统府后，警察只让极少数的几个代表把请愿书送进去，大批群众就在层层包围起来的总统府前高唱“马赛歌”，并高喊：“让普利文辞职！”“把朝鲜交还给朝鲜人！”“不许重新武装西德！”如临大敌的军警企图冲散请愿队伍，但是群众马上又重新集合起来，继续整队行进。当队伍走到美国大使馆、美国新闻处和英国大使馆门前时，人们激昂地高呼：“法国是属于法国人的！”“不许把武器交给纳粹，我们要和平！”
    十二日，巴黎人民又响应法共塞纳省委会、各工会组织和许多民主团体的号召，在巴黎全区举行示威游行，散发传单。
    纳粹占领下的法国政治犯十日晚间在巴黎召开了全国代表大会，讨论如何发动全国性的抗议运动。这些从希特勒集中营中死里逃生的人们和他们家属的八千名代表，都一致郑重宣誓：“我们竭力抗议重新武装那些蹂躏我国的人。重新武装那些人，就是侮辱我们的烈士，就是危害法国的安全，也就是威胁世界和平。”每个代表团都带着奥拉德，奥希维兹，维尔戈斯勃列翁堡这些抵抗纳粹圣地的一把泥土回去，准备在法国一切大市镇中将这把浸透了反纳粹战士的鲜血的泥土隆重下葬，以展开反对美国重新武装西德的抗议运动。
    “前法国内地军、义勇军、游击队军人全国协会”执行局发表了一项决议，反对重新武装西德，要求举行四强会议解决德国问题，并号召过去参加抵抗运动的人们更紧密地团结起来，在全国各地组织抵抗运动委员会。
