Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, December 8th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in crushing the so-called "general offensive" of the American aggressors and launching a large-scale counter-offensive, have eliminated a large number of enemy troops and liberated many cities and vast rural areas. On the Western Front alone, in the week from November 25th to December 1st, 23,700 enemy troops were killed, wounded, or captured. The communiqué issued by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army on the 6th stated: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the week from November 25th to December 1st, swiftly crushed the American aggressors' so-called "general offensive to end the war," and switched to a counter-offensive, eliminating a large number of enemy troops and recovering large tracts of lost territory. The details are as follows:

Under the personal deployment of war criminal MacArthur, the American aggressors gathered all the forces they could deploy in the Korean War, including seven divisions of the American aggressor army, one brigade each from the British and Australian armies, one brigade from the Turkish army, and six divisions of the Lee Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) bandit army. Starting on November 24th, they advanced along multiple routes towards the northern Korean-Chinese border. On the Eastern Front, the enemy scurried to the line of Chongjin, Hyesan, and Changjin Lake; on the Western Front, the enemy scurried to the line of Nyongbyon, Sinhung-dong, Unsan, Taechon, and Chongju, attempting to annihilate our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in one fell swoop and destroy Korea.

Our army began its counterattack on November 25th, dealing a heavy blow to the invading enemy on all fronts. First, we inflicted heavy casualties on the U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the Sinhung-dong (north of Kujang) and Somin-dong areas. Subsequently, in the Tokchon and Nyongwon areas, we separately encircled and annihilated the majority of the Lee Seung-man bandit army's 7th and 8th Divisions and a part of the 6th Division, thereby halting the enemy's offensive and enabling ourselves to switch to a counter-offensive. By the 27th, the enemy was shaken across the entire front and retreated in disarray. Our army pursued fiercely along two routes, and again encircled parts of the U.S. 2nd Division's 9th and 23rd Regiments, the 25th Division's 24th Regiment, and the Turkish Brigade in the Kachon and Kunuri southwest areas, annihilating them completely after fierce fighting.

At the same time, parts of the U.S. 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division, which had advanced to Changjin on the Eastern Front, were also encircled in the areas west and south of Changjin Lake, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The puppet troops, who had ventured as far as Chongjin and Hyesan, also retreated in fear of annihilation.

Thus, the American aggressors' heavily touted general offensive to quickly end the war of aggression against Korea has shamefully turned into a general rout. The enemy troops abandoned supplies, wrecked vehicles, and fled southwards for their lives. By December 1st, our People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had successively recovered the cities of Chongju, Taechon, Nyongbyon, Tokchon, Nyongwon, Maengsan, Pakchon, Anju, Sinanju, Kachon, Kunuri, and the cities of Chongjin, Ranam, Kyongsong, and Hyesan on the Eastern Front, as well as vast areas. The defeated enemy, like stray dogs, is continuing to flee south. The results of the week's battles, on the Western Front alone, according to preliminary statistics, are as follows:

1. Units Eliminated and Defeated: Eliminated one regiment and eight and a half battalions of the U.S. aggressor army, including: the entire 9th Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division, one and a half battalions each of the 23rd and 38th Regiments, one and a half battalions of the 24th Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division, one battalion of the 27th Regiment, two battalions each of the 35th Regiment, and one battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division; Eliminated three battalions of the Turkish Brigade, a U.S. imperialist pawn; Eliminated four regiments (regiments) and four battalions (battalions) of the Lee Seung-man bandit army, including: the entire 5th and 8th Regiments of the 7th Division, the entire 10th and 21st Regiments of 8th Division, one battalion of the 16th Regiment, the entire direct-subordinate howitzer battalion of said division, one battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 6th Division, and one battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 1st Division. One company of the enemy surrendered, namely: the entire engineer company of the 35th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division. Defeated five regiments of the U.S. aggressor army, including: the 5th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 23rd and 38th Regiments of the 2nd Infantry Division, and the 24th and 35th Regiments of the 25th Infantry Division; Defeated one battalion of the 27th Brigade of the British and Australian armies, a U.S. imperialist pawn, and the entire Turkish Brigade; Defeated the command posts of two divisions and four regiments of the Lee Seung-man bandit army, including the command post of the 7th Division, the 3rd Regiment of the 7th Division, the command post of the 8th Division, the 16thRegiment of the 8th Division, the 2nd Regiment of the 6th Division, and the 11th Regiment of the 1st Division.

    朝鲜人民军总司令部发表一周战绩公报
    西线歼灭敌军两万三千余
    东线美军两师残部正被围歼中
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地八日电】朝鲜人民军与我人民志愿军在粉碎美国侵略者的所谓总攻势并大举反攻中，已歼灭敌军大量有生力量，解放许多城市和广大乡村。仅西线方面，在十一月二十五日至十二月一日的一周中，已毙伤俘敌军二万三千七百人。朝鲜人民军总司令部六日公报称：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队，于十一月二十五日至本月一日一周中，迅速粉碎美国侵略者所谓“结束战争总攻势”，并使自己转入反攻，大量歼灭敌人有生力量，收复大片失地。其经过如下：
    在战犯麦克阿瑟亲自部署下，美国侵略者结集其在朝鲜战争可以动用的全部兵力，计美国侵略军七个师，英澳军一个旅，土耳其军一个旅，李承晚匪军六个师，于十一月二十四日起，分路向朝鲜北部中朝边境进犯。东线敌窜至清津、惠山、长津湖一线；西线敌窜至宁远、新兴洞、云山、泰川、定州一线，企图一举歼灭我人民军与中国人民志愿部队，灭亡朝鲜。
    我军于十一月二十五日开始反击，予各路进犯之敌以痛击。首先于新兴洞（球场以北）、苏民洞一带予美步兵第二、第二十五两师以重创。继在德川与宁远地区，分别围歼李承晚匪军第七、第八两师大部及第六师一部，因而停止了敌人的进攻，使自己转入反攻。至二十七日，敌全线动摇，纷纷溃退。我军两路衔尾猛追，又复包围美军第二师第九团、二十三团，二十五师二十四团，及土耳其旅各一部于价川、军隅里西南地区，激战后予以全歼。
    同时东线向长津进犯之美陆战第一师及步兵第七师各一部，亦被包围于长津湖以西及以南地区，现仍激战中。曾一度冒进至清津、惠山一线之伪军亦惧歼回窜。
    至此，美国侵略者所大肆吹嘘的企图从速结束侵朝战争的总攻击，乃可耻地变为总溃退。敌军丢去辎重，撞坏车辆，夺路南逃。至本月一日止，我人民军与中国人民志愿部队，已先后收复定州、泰川、宁边、德川、宁远、孟山、博川、安州、新安州、价川、军隅里及东线之清津、罗南、镜城、惠山等城市及广大地区。溃败之敌如丧家之犬，现仍继续向南逃窜。一周来战果，仅西线方面，据初步统计如下：
    一、歼灭与击溃敌军番号：歼灭美国侵略军一个团、八个半营，计：步兵第二师第九团全部，第二十三团、第三十八团各一个半营，步兵第二十五师第二十四团一个半营，第二十七团一个营，第三十五团两个营，骑兵第一师第七团一个营；歼灭美帝附庸土耳其旅三个营；歼灭李承晚匪军四个联队（团），四个大队（营），计：第七师第五、第八两个联队全部，第八师第十、第二十一两个联队全部，第十六联队一个大队，该师直属榴弹炮大队全部，第六师第二联队一个大队，第一师第十一联队一个大队。敌军投降一个连，计：美步兵第二十五师第三十五团工兵连全部。击溃美国侵略军五个团，计：骑兵第一师第五团，步兵第二师二十三、三十八两个团，步兵第二十五师二十四、三十五两个团；击溃美帝附庸英澳第二十七旅一个营，土耳其旅全部；击溃李承晚匪军两个师指挥所，四个联队，计：第七师指挥所，第七师第三联队，第八师指挥所，第八师第十六联队，第六师第二联队，第一师第十一联队。以上共计歼灭敌军五个团、十五个半营，受降一个连，击溃敌军两个师指挥所，一个旅，九个团，一个营。
    二、毙伤俘敌军：毙伤美军官兵八○八五人（包括英、土军在内）；毙伤李承晚匪军官兵七八四七人，共毙伤敌军一五九三二人。俘虏美军官兵二二七二人（包括英、土军，及美日籍顾问一人），内团长以下校级军官十二人；俘李匪军五三五三人，共俘虏敌军七六二五人。美军投降一四三人。以上合计敌军共损失兵力二三七○○人。
    三、缴获各种炮五二一门（内榴弹炮一五一门），各种机枪四六四挺，各种长短枪四七三六枝，坦克五五辆，飞机一架，汽车一九五三辆；击毁坦克四九辆，汽车九二辆，击落敌机一架；缴获其它军用物资无算，正清查中。
