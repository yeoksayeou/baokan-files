East China

[Our Newspaper] Youth and students in East China are enthusiastically signing up for military cadre schools, and are receiving enthusiastic encouragement from teachers and many parents at various schools. Following Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong and other provinces and cities, the enrollment committees of Zhejiang, Fujian, Wuhu and other provinces and cities have also been established successively. In Shanghai, the number of young students who have applied has reached 10,000. In Nanjing's universities and middle schools, since the incident of American professors at Jinling University and Jinling Women's Arts and Sciences College slandering and insulting the Chinese people and Chinese students, an anti-American and patriotic movement has been launched. During the movement, due to the general improvement of students' ideological awareness, students participating in military cadre schools are extremely enthusiastic. Li Jinhua, a student at Jinling Women's Arts and Sciences College, Wu Qingdun, a student at Jinling University, and Li Xiuqun, a student at Jinling Girls' Middle School, were previously insufficiently active due to the influence of American imperialist deceptive propaganda. After being educated about the crimes of American imperialism, they are determined to use practical actions of participating in military cadre schools to respond to the conspiracies of American imperialism. The deadline for enrollment in the city was December 16, and the total number of applicants reached 7,463. More than 3,500 students in Jinan have applied, and the first batch of 409 have been formally approved. The 40 students approved from the Provincial Agricultural College, after a grand farewell party, were sent to the city's Enrollment Committee on the afternoon of December 16 by a waist drum team organized by teachers and students of the college. In Qingdao, more than 1,000 students from Shandong University and Huadong University have applied. In Wuxi, Suzhou, and Wuhu, the number of students who have applied has reached 2,000.

Teachers and parents of students at various schools are extremely happy to see their children's glorious actions of loving the motherland. Wu Yun, the 70-year-old manager of Shanghai Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, said in a letter to his only daughter, Wu Zhilian (a student in the Journalism Department of Fudan University), who asked for his opinion on applying for a military cadre school: "Zhilian: I received your letter of the 12th and 9th. I am in my twilight years and only have you as a daughter, so I am naturally reluctant to separate from you. But you are willing to dedicate yourself to the motherland and the people, and prepare to shed the last drop of blood. This action and spirit is great. How can I forget the righteousness of protecting my home and defending my country with my love for my child? I give you my warm encouragement and praise." On the 13th, the Jiefang Daily held a symposium on "Why I Encourage My Children to Participate in Military Cadre Schools." At the meeting, Mr. Wu mentioned: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang bandit gang initiated the organization of the "Youth Army" to fight a civil war and attack the people. Wu Zhilian's brother wanted to sign up, but he resolutely opposed it; but today the situation has fundamentally changed. The People's Government loves the people, and young people participate in military cadre schools truly to defend the motherland and defend peace, so he not only does not stop his daughter, but also encourages her to go. Liu Baichuan, director of the Workers and Peasants Education Department of Wuxi College of Arts and Education, wrote to his fourth son, Gu Run, saying: "If you are also willing to participate in military cadre school to study, that is my greatest honor, and also the glory of the whole family. Dad failed to participate in the people's revolutionary struggle in the past, and it is still an irreparable regret. If you can join the ranks of the revolutionary struggle like your older brother and sister, then it can give me great comfort." Nanjing Municipal No. 1 Middle School held a parents' meeting on the 12th to solicit parents' opinions on students participating in military cadre schools. More than 400 parents of students attended. Many wise parents expressed their approval of their children who had already requested to participate in military schools. They said: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao love young people the most, and they will take good care of our children. Some parents who did not attend due to other matters wrote to the school's recommendation committee, requesting that their children be recommended to participate in military schools. When Chen Zhenzhou, a student at Nanjing University, signed up, her mother said at the signing ceremony: "My child is participating in military cadre school to consolidate national defense, defend the country, and defend thousands of mothers. I feel very honored!" Zheng Wanjun, a professor at the school, has three sons who signed up to participate in military schools. He said: "The children's thinking is one step ahead of me. The motherland calls on them to participate in national defense construction, and I send them to this glorious post." Cao Guoqing, director of the Economics Department of Jinling University, encouraged his son to sign up, saying: "I not only agree with my son going, but if the motherland needs me, I will also go." Professors at Nanjing University visited student dormitories and wrote letters to encourage them. Dai Naidie (Glodys M. Jgler), a British professor, said to the students: "China is a great country. The Chinese army is very strong, not only ensuring China's peace, but also defending world peace."

Central South

[Our Newspaper] Youth students and young workers in large and medium-sized cities in Central South China are enthusiastically signing up for military cadre schools.

Students from various schools in Wuhan conducted heated discussions on the joint decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the State Council. On the 10th, the principals of universities and middle schools in the city, leaders of various democratic parties, and the person in charge of the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly issued a letter to parents, urging them to encourage their children to participate in military cadre schools. Lin Houzhou, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, gave his son great encouragement to participate in military school. He said: "I love my son very much, and I love my country even more. I know that only by building a strong national defense force can we recover our blood debts and avenge our blood feuds." He also mobilized his relatives, friends and people from business and industry to encourage their children to participate in military schools. Now the city's university and middle school students are enthusiastically signing up; those who have already signed up are anxiously hoping for the approval of the enrollment committee. 1,153 students from Wuhan University have written letters of determination. Zhou Le, a student in the Physics Department, said in his letter of determination: "Seeing the bombs of American imperialism dropped on the land of the motherland, my heart is burned by the flames of anger. Now the motherland is calling us. In order to defend the motherland, I have decided to participate in military school." Teachers and workers also expressed their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and strive to defend the country. According to preliminary statistics on the 15th, more than 360 young workers in the city have signed up.

Cen Guojin, a member of the Youth League in Guangya Middle School, said: "In the past, I only knew how to love my parents, but today I want to extend my love to loving the motherland. I have decided to participate in military school." At the enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the city's student union held on the 10th by the Changsha Student Federation, it was emphasized that participation in military cadre schools must adhere to the principle of voluntariness; the student union must seize the link of strengthening anti-imperialist education to improve students' ideological understanding. After two weeks of current affairs study, students at Hunan University have expressed their intention to implement their understanding of resisting the United States and aiding Korea into practical action. Students are in high spirits and enthusiastically request to participate in military school. Students from Changjun Middle School, Chuyi Industrial School, Mingde Middle School and other schools have signed up. Many parents encouraged their children to participate in military cadre schools. For example, Tang Qian's father, a student at Chuyi Industrial School, encouraged him and said: "Now the motherland needs you, and this is the opportunity to serve the motherland. You should participate." As of the 12th, more than 2,500 students and workers had signed up.

In addition, young students in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Zhenping and other places in Henan Province have generally launched a wave of participation in military schools. Many students in Kaifeng and Zhenping have been honorably approved. These approved students received a warm send-off from teachers and students of their respective schools; the teachers and students of each school held grand farewell meetings and gave souvenirs to the students participating in military cadre schools. More than 1,000 students in various parts of Hubei Province have participated in military school. In middle schools in Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xiangyang and other regions, the number of students who have applied has reached half of the students in each school.

Students from Nankai University, Beiyang University, Hebei Institute of Technology and various public and private secondary schools in Tianjin are enthusiastically signing up with the recommendation committee. More than 800 students from Beiyang and Nankai universities have signed up. Before the establishment of the recommendation committee at Hebei Institute of Technology, two-thirds of the third-year students in the Mechanical Engineering Department had signed up in the student union. After Yan Rongdi, a student at Nankai University, decided to sign up, he wrote to his father saying: "I am not ignoring my family, but to take care of more families and prevent more parents from being insulted, so I decided to participate in military school." Young workers from various factories in Tianjin are also actively signing up. On the 14th and 15th, the State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill had 72 applicants.

More than 1,200 students from universities and middle schools in Baoding, Hebei Province, held a discussion on the crimes of American imperialism in invading our territory of Taiwan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. More than 150 young students from various schools signed up to participate in military cadre schools.

Under the enthusiastic send-off of people from all walks of life, the first batch of 76 young students and young workers went to military cadre school to study. Wang Meicun, a teacher in his fifties at Tongxian Men's Normal School in Hebei Province, mobilized his grandson to sign up for military cadre school. He also said to the students: "To say that I love him is true, but he shouldn't belong to me privately, I want him to be a good son and daughter of the motherland. I am so old, I have experienced too many things about imperialist aggression against us, and I deeply know the pain of family destruction and death when war breaks out, so I am determined to mobilize him to go to military school to defend the motherland and protect us." His actions and talks encouraged many students to make up their minds to go to the glorious post of national defense construction. 194 people signed up at Tongxian Women's Normal School in Hebei Province, and the school's recommendation committee recommended 60 people. The whole school is preparing for a send-off. Workers in the province have also responded to this call. Zhang Tiejun, an employee of the Shijiazhuang Telecommunications Bureau, first signed up with extreme hatred for imperialism, and said: "After participating in military school, I must study hard to answer the party and the Youth League's training of me and the people's hope for me."

Students from various middle schools in Anyang, Pingyuan Province, enthusiastically studied the joint decision of the Military Commission and the State Council, persuaded and explained to their families, and more than 800 people signed up on the 12th and 13th.

At the meeting of the accusation of the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism held by Zhangjiakou Normal School in Chahar Province, Bai Shifang, a member of the Youth League, said sadly and indignantly: "Blood debts must be paid with blood! I am determined to participate in military school to study, so as to defend our motherland and avenge the dead compatriots!" As of the 12th, 170 people had signed up at Shanxi University.
