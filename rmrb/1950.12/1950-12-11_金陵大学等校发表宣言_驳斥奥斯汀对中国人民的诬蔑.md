    Xinhua News Agency Report: Jinling University, Ginling College, Cheeloo University and other missionary schools successively issued declarations on the 4th and 5th, refuting Austin's shameless lies, and calling on all teachers, students, and staff of missionary schools across the country to respond to this just action.

    The statements from Ginling College and Jinling University pointed out that the establishment of churches and schools in China by American imperialism was an act of aggression. According to the personal experiences of the teachers, students, and staff of the two schools, the American educational policy towards China was to spread imperialist ideology and poison the Chinese people, which was an act of cultural aggression. The public humiliation of Chinese students and slanderous remarks against the Chinese people by American professors such as Ferris Fitch, W.P. Mills, and J. Lossing Buck are examples. There is a close friendship between the Chinese people and the broad masses of the American people. However, the people of New China are firmly opposed to imperialism. The statement concluded by pointing out that the teachers, students, and staff of Jinling University and Ginling College will stand with the entire Chinese people and jointly strive for the great patriotic movement to defend world peace and oppose American aggression, which is now unfolding in full swing.

    Cheeloo University stated in its declaration that in the hundred-year history of American imperialist aggression against China, cultural aggression was the first step. American imperialism attempted to use schools and various religious charitable organizations established in China to deceive our youth and numb our souls through religious, cultural, and other deceptive means, and then create "talents" to serve them. A sentence in the memorandum from the President of the University of Illinois to President Roosevelt, "The nation which succeeds in educating this generation of young Chinese will reap the largest possible harvest in terms of spiritual and commercial influence as a result of the efforts expended in this regard," is the essence of the aggressor's "friendship."

    金陵大学等校发表宣言
    驳斥奥斯汀对中国人民的诬蔑
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院、齐鲁大学等教会学校相继于四、五日发表宣言，驳斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言，号召全国各教会学校的全体师生员工响应这一正义行动。
    金陵女子文理学院和金陵大学的声明中指出：美帝国主义在华设立教会，创办学校，是一种侵略行为。根据两校师生员工的亲身的体验，证明了美国对华的教育政策，是为了传播帝国主义的思想言论，毒害中国人民的文化侵略行为。美籍教授费睿思、芮陶庵、林查礼等公然悔辱中国学生，诽谤中国人民的言论，就是例证。中国人民和美国广大的人民之间，存在着亲密的友谊。但是新中国人民，是坚决反对帝国主义的。声明最后并指出：金陵大学及金陵女子文理学院的全体师生员工将与全中国人民站在一起，为正在展开着的如火如荼的保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的伟大爱国运动而共同奋斗。
    齐鲁大学在宣言中指出：在百来年的美帝国主义侵略中国的史实中，文化侵略为侵略的第一步。美帝国主义企图通过在华创办的学校及各种宗教慈善团体，以宗教、文化及其他欺骗手段，来蒙蔽我国青年的视听，麻痹我们的灵魂，进而造成为他们服务的“人才”。美国伊里诺州大学校长致罗斯福总统的备忘录中的一句话：“那一个国家能教育这一代的年青中国人，那一个国家就将由于在这方面支付的努力而在精神的商业的影响上取得最大可能的收获”，即是侵略者“友谊”的本质。
