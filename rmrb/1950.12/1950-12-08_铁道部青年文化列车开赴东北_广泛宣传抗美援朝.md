    Railway Ministry Youth Culture Train Departs for Northeast
    Widely Promoting Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 5th] The "Youth Culture Train," jointly organized by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the China Youth Art Theater, departed from Beijing on the 4th to go to the Northeast to carry out propaganda work for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country.
    The artistic staff of the train made full preparations before departure, creating and rehearsing a complete set of artistic performance programs for "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes, and Defending Our Country." The content starts from "The History of American Aggression Against China," followed by "American Military Atrocities," "The Accusation of Korean Elders," "The Chinese and Korean People are as Close as Flesh and Blood," "Guarding the Peaceful Manor," "Volunteering to Cross the River," and finally "Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country." The forms include singing, clapper talk, poetry recitation, living newspaper, drama, Yangko opera, chorus, etc. This set of programs was trial performed in the Central Railway Ministry and achieved great success.
    In addition, the train also has movies such as "Daughters of China," "The Young Guard," "Newsreel," etc., and more than ten small dramas such as "Departure" as well as photos and propaganda paintings exposing the US imperialist aggression against Korea.
    After arriving in the Northeast, the train will widely perform for the staff and workers of various railway lines along the lines and the vast number of peasants in various places.
    Correction
    In the article "The Period of Transition from Capitalism to Socialism in the Soviet Union" by Dr. Eugene published on page 3 of this newspaper on December 1, the third line of the section "The Occurrence of the Socialist Component of the National Economy," "October 26, 1917 (i.e., November 8 in the old Russian calendar)" should be "November 7, 1917 (i.e., October 26 in the old calendar)."

    铁道部青年文化列车开赴东北
    广泛宣传抗美援朝
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府铁道部和中国青年艺术剧院合办的“青年文化列车”，已于四日离京开往东北，展开抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传工作。
    该列车的艺术工作人员在出发前经过充分的准备，创作、排演完成了一整套“抗美援朝保家卫国”的文艺演出节目，内容是从“美国侵华史”开始，接着是“美军暴行”、“朝鲜老人的控诉”、“中朝人民血肉相连”、“守卫和平的庄园”、“志愿过江”直到“保家卫国”，形式有演唱、快板、诗歌朗诵、活报、话剧、秧歌剧、合唱等。这套节目曾在中央铁道部试演，获得很大成功。
    此外，列车尚有电影片《中华女儿》、《青年近卫军》、《新闻简报》等和《出车》等十余个小戏剧以及控诉美帝侵略朝鲜的照片、宣传画。
    该列车到东北后，将广泛地为各铁路线的职工线沿及各地广大的农民等演出。
    更正
    十二月一日本报三版载尤金博士所著《苏联从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期》中“国民经济的社会主义成分的发生”一节第三行“一九一七年十月二十六日（即旧俄历十一月八日）”应为“一九一七年十一月七日（即旧历十月二十六日）”。
