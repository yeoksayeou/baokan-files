    Harbin "Nightingale Rescue Team"
    Rushes to Korean Front in Five Days

    [Report from this newspaper] The first group of more than 50 members of the "Nightingale Rescue Team" voluntarily formed by students from the Harbin Municipal Hospital Nursing School to resist US aggression and aid Korea, departed on the 5th of this month. Before their departure, staff from the city's Health Bureau held a farewell meeting. The departing team members were all in high spirits and full of confidence in the victory of the Korean War of Liberation. They said, "We will not return without victory!"
