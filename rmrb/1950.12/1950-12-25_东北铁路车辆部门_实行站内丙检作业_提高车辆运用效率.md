    Northeast Railway Vehicle Department
    Implements Station-Based C Inspection
    Improves Vehicle Utilization Efficiency
    [This Newspaper Report] According to the Northeast Daily News: Within the jurisdiction of the Railway Ministry's Northeast Special Commissioner's Office, the implementation of C-type inspection operations on freight cars on station tracks has reduced the repair time of vehicles by more than 9,000 hours in November.

    The vehicle department of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office, in view of the shortage of vehicles and the heavy transportation tasks, starting from November, has changed the previous practice of sending freight cars to the inspection and repair lines of the vehicle repair section for C-type inspection (i.e., minor inspection performed every sixty days, hereinafter referred to as C inspection) to be repaired on the station tracks. By doing so, the vehicles undergoing inspection no longer have to wait a certain amount of time to enter the section for repair, nor do the repaired vehicles have to wait a certain amount of time to be put into operation. Instead, they can be promptly repaired or put into use, thereby shortening the vehicle repair stop time, achieving the goal of improving vehicle turnover rate, overcoming vehicle shortages, and ensuring the completion of heavy winter transportation tasks. As of the end of November, the Jinzhou, Jilin, and Qiqihar Railway Administrations, as well as the Andong Railway Sub-bureau, had performed C inspections on 912 vehicles within the station. According to statistics from November 20th to 29th, the average repair stop time per vehicle in the station was 3.8 hours, a reduction of 10.2 hours compared to the average of 14 hours per vehicle for C inspections in the section in October. The 912 vehicles saved a total of 9,302 vehicle hours. The reduced repair stop time for the 912 vehicles is equivalent to increasing the transportation efficiency of 387 vehicles, and if calculated based on the average daily income per vehicle, it can increase railway operating income by more than 1.2 billion yuan (Northeast currency).

    Because C inspections are performed in the station, it also overcomes the previous uneven distribution of workload among train inspection personnel. For example, the train repair station of the Jilin Vehicle Repair Section can draw six people every day to perform C inspections in the station, but before November, these six people were completely wasted waiting for trains.

### 东北铁路车辆部门  实行站内丙检作业  提高车辆运用效率

    实行站内丙检作业
    提高车辆运用效率
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：铁道部驻东北特派员办事处管内，实行车辆在车站站线上进行丙种检修作业，十一月份缩短了车辆检修停留时间九千多小时。
    东北特派员办事处车辆部门，鉴于车辆不足而运输任务繁重，从十一月份起，将以前送到检车段检修线上进行丙种检修（即每隔六十天施行一次的轻微检修，以下简称丙检）的货车，改在车站站线上进行修理。这样做，进行检修的车辆，就不再等待着一定的时间才能入段检修，或检修完的车辆，也不再等待着一定的时间才能出段运用，而可以及时得到检修或运用，从而能够缩短车辆检修停留时间，达到提高车辆周转率，克服车辆不足，保证完成繁重的冬季运输任务的目的。到十一月底为止，锦州、吉林、齐齐哈尔各铁路管理局及安东铁路分局管内各检车段，共在站内作了九百十二辆丙检车辆，根据十一月二十日到二十九日的统计，每辆车在站内的检修停留时间，平均为三点八小时，较十月份入段丙检每辆车平均十四小时缩减了十点二小时，九百十二辆车，共节省九千三百零二车小时。九百十二辆车缩短的检修停留时间，等于增加了三百八十七辆车的运输效率，如果按每辆车每日平均收入计算，可使铁路营业收入增加十二亿元（东北币）以上。
    由于在站内作丙检，还克服了从前列车检修人员闲忙不均的现象，如吉林检车段列车检修所，每天能够抽出六个人来作站内丙检，但在十一月份以前，这六个人完全白搭在等候列车的时间里。
