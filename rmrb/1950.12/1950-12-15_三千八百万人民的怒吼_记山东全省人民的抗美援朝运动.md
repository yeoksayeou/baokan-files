    The Roar of Thirty-Eight Million People
    —A Record of the Entire Shandong Province's Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Our Correspondents Wei Yantang and Zou An
    Shandong faces Korea across the sea. Since the U.S. imperialists invaded Korea, people have been constantly concerned about the development of the Korean war situation. The heroic people of Shandong exerted their greatest efforts during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, because they suffered the devastation and oppression of the Japanese and U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When the U.S. imperialists frantically invaded the 38th parallel, extending the flames of war to our national border, the people of Shandong also personally witnessed American planes conducting low-altitude reconnaissance along the coast, strafing fishing boats. Old and new hatreds ignited together, and a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has been widely launched throughout Shandong.

    In every factory in Jinan, you only hear the rumbling of machines and cannot find a single idle person. Luo Shufang, a model worker at a textile factory, sometimes works eleven and a half hours a day. The staff of the Industrial Bureau spend only twenty minutes eating lunch. On November 5th, industrial model worker Liu Qingxiang issued a challenge letter to agricultural model workers Zhang Fugui and Lü Hongbin. The letter said: "The ferocious U.S. imperialists are following the old path of Japanese fascists invading our country, invading our neighbor Korea, and our Taiwan. China and Korea are as closely related as flesh and blood. We cannot ignore the U.S. imperialists' aggression. I will support the Korean people's just war with the practical action of stepping up production and construction." After putting forward a production plan, he sincerely said: "I hope you will do a good job in agricultural production, provide us with industrial raw materials, and make machines for developing agricultural production." Textile model worker Luo Shufang said in her challenge letter to female agricultural model worker Li Tianying: "You produce more grain, and we weave more cloth. Let's put forth our strength and burn the paper tiger." After these challenge letters were issued, they immediately received a heroic response, and letters of acceptance flew in like snowflakes. Agricultural model worker Lü Hongbin wrote in his letter of acceptance: "It is exactly what I want to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with the practical action of increasing production. I will do a good job in the village's mutual aid, plowing on behalf of others, and paying public grain. My four and a half mu of land has all been winter plowed. I am also preparing to buy a waterwheel, accumulate more fertilizer, and plant more cash crops next year to produce more grain to supply the national construction. Let's workers and farmers join hands to fulfill Chairman Mao's call to build a strong economic and defense force." Patriotic production competitions are now underway in factories and villages.

    During the War of Liberation, countless military dependents encouraged their sons to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang personally supported by the United States. Today, they have similarly demonstrated their great patriotic spirit, writing letters to their husbands and sons, calling on them to make every effort to strengthen national defense. Labor hero Zheng Xin said in his letter to his son, Pei Rong: "I see it clearly: the U.S. imperialists occupying a few cities in Korea is like the Kuomintang bandit gang occupying our Linyi. They are like ants on a hot pot, enjoying themselves for a while, and will soon be finished. I hope you will work hard at the front, and I will step up production in the rear. The front and rear are of one mind, and we will resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to win victory."

    The U.S. imperialists' crimes of aggression have further aroused the anger of the militia in various parts of Shandong. They are standing on the front line of national defense, ready at any time to strike the U.S. imperialists and defend the coast. Flying Explosives King Zuo Tairen said: "I will definitely lead and educate the militia to improve their skills and political level, prevent bandits and special agents, do a good job in local public security work, and protect the masses' production. If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade, I will immediately take up arms and wipe them out!" In the vast countryside, a movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is being launched with unparalleled enthusiasm. The farmers of Dacheng Village automatically held a meeting to accuse the Chiang bandits of their atrocities. They said that Chiang Kai-shek is the adopted son of the United States. If his adopted son is so cruel, wouldn't his adopted father be even more vicious? Xiong Zhiduan said: "In the past, we were oppressed by landlords, and the landlords were overthrown; Chiang Kai-shek bullied us, and we drove him into the sea; now the American devils are coming again. The United States, landlords, and the Chiang bandits are all the same bloodsuckers! We must show the spirit of fighting the landlords and beat the United States to a pulp!" With tragic hearts, the farmers of the whole village swore: "If there are American devils, there will be no us; if there is us, there will be no American robbers. U.S. imperialism is our mortal enemy, and we must resolutely fight it to the end!"

    "Handing in one more grain is equivalent to killing one more American robber." Farmers shouted battle slogans and enthusiastically handed in public grain. The earliest counties, such as Yiyuan and Mengshan, completed their task by the end of October. The provincial autumn tax collection was largely completed around November 20. In the Xiachiao district of Mengshan, thirty-three villages, with a total of 245,200 jin of public grain, were all put into storage in three days, without a single tail owing. When men, women, and children from Hou Daquan Village in the Daquan District of Yiyuan were delivering public grain, it rained on the road, but due to the support of the determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they were not intimidated by the sudden rain. They sang songs like "Deliver public grain on rainy days, beat the American wolves to death" and delivered the grain to the grain station in the rain. Currently, under the slogan of "The land doesn't freeze, the plowing doesn't stop," they are making every effort to attack winter plowing.

    After the news of the victories of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield spread, people from all over wrote letters of condolence to the People's Volunteer Army participating in the war in Korea. All medical workers at the Guangming Clinic in Jinan wrote letters to the volunteers going to Korea and donated 150,000 yuan in RMB for the purchase of comfort bags.

    三千八百万人民的怒吼
    ——记山东全省人民的抗美援朝运动
    本报通讯员  魏延堂·邹庵
    山东与朝鲜隔海东西相望。自从美帝国主义侵略朝鲜以来，人们时刻关怀着朝鲜战局的发展。英勇的山东人民在抗日战争与解放战争中曾尽了最大的努力，因为他们受尽了日、美帝国主义者及蒋介石匪帮的摧残和压榨。当美帝疯狂进犯“三八线”，将战争火焰延烧到祖国边疆的时候，山东人民又亲眼看到了美国的飞机在沿海一带低空侦察，扫射渔船，新仇旧恨一起勾发，轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，在山东各地普遍开展起来。
    在济南市的每一个工厂里，你只听见隆隆的机器声，找不到一个闲人。纺织工厂的工业劳模骆淑芳，有时一天工作十一个半钟头。工业局的职工们以二十分钟的短促时间吃午饭。十一月五日，工业劳模刘庆祥向农业劳模张富贵、吕鸿滨发出了挑战书。信上说：“凶恶的美帝国主义正走着日本法西斯侵略我国的老路，侵略了我们的邻邦朝鲜，和我国的台湾。中国和朝鲜血肉相连，咱们对美帝的侵略不能置之不理。我是以加紧生产建设的实际行动来支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。”他在提出了生产计划后诚恳地说：“我希望你们把农业生产搞好，供给我们工业原料，好制造发展农业生产的机器。”纺织劳模骆淑芳给女农业劳模李田英的挑战书上说：“你们多打粮，我们多织布，拿出力量来，烧掉纸老虎。”这些挑战书发出后，立即得到英雄的响应，应战书似雪片飞来。农业劳模吕鸿斌的应战书上写道：“以提高生产的实际行动抗美援朝，正合我的心意。我要搞好全村的互助、代耕、缴纳公粮等工作。我的四亩五分地已全部冬耕了，我还准备买水车，多积肥，明年多种经济作物，多打粮食，好供给国家建设。咱们工人和农民拉起手来，完成毛主席发出的建设强大的经济力量和国防力量的号召。”爱国主义生产竞赛现已在工厂和农村中开展起来了。
    在解放战争中，无数的军属们鼓励着自己的儿子，打垮了美国亲手扶植的蒋介石匪帮。今天，他们同样的发挥了伟大的爱国精神，纷纷给丈夫、儿子写信，叫他们百倍努力巩固国防。劳动英雄郑信给他儿子培荣的信上说：“我看透了：美帝在朝鲜占了几个城市，就和国民党匪帮进占咱们的临沂一样，是热锅上的蚂蚁自在一时，不久就会完蛋。望你在前方努力工作，我在后方加紧生产，前后方一条心，抗美援朝赢得胜利。”
    美帝的侵略罪行，更引起了山东各地民兵的愤怒，他们都站在国防前线上时刻准备打击美帝保卫海防。飞行爆炸大王左太传说：“我一定领导和教育民兵提高技术，提高政治水平，防匪防特，作好地方治安工作，保卫群众生产。如美帝敢来进犯，我就立即拿起武器消灭它！”广大的农村中正以无比的热情掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。大成庄的农民们自动地开大会控诉蒋匪暴行。他们说蒋介石是美国的干儿子，他干儿子都这么残忍，他干爹不更毒辣吗？熊智端说：“过去咱受地主的压迫，地主打倒了；蒋介石欺侮咱们，也叫咱赶到海里去了；现在美国鬼子又要来了。美国和地主蒋贼是一样的喝血鬼！咱得拿出打地主的精神，把美国打个落花流水。全村的农民怀着悲壮的心情，宣誓说：“有美国鬼子在，就没有咱们在，有咱们在就没有美国强盗在，美帝国主义是咱不共戴天的仇敌，咱要坚决和它干到底！”
    “多缴一粒粮，就等于多打死一个美国强盗。”农民们喊着战斗的口号，踊跃缴纳公粮。最早的沂源、蒙山等县，在十月底就缴完了。全省秋征在十一月二十日前后已大体结束。蒙山下桥区三十三个村子，二十四万五千二百斤公粮，三天全部入仓，无一尾欠。沂源大泉区后大泉庄男女老幼送公粮时，在路上天下了雨，但是由于抗美援朝的决心的支持，并没有被骤雨所吓倒，他们唱着“雨天交公粮，打死美国野心狼”的歌子，冒雨送到粮站。目前各地在“地不冻犁不停”的口号下，正全力突击冬耕工作。
    朝鲜战场上人民军和中国人民志愿军打胜仗的消息传来后，各地人民又纷纷写慰问信慰问赴朝参战的人民志愿部队。济南市光明诊所全体医务工作者，给赴朝志愿军写信，并捐出了人民币十五万元作为购买慰劳袋之用。
