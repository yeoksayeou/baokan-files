    Portraits of the American Invaders in Korea
    By our special correspondent  Li Wei
          (I)
    After MacArthur's "general offensive" on the Korean battlefield was crushed, we found some American newspapers on the battlefield around Jiachuan, south of the Chongchon River. One of them, the October 7th issue of "Stars and Stripes," published two nauseating news items on the front page. One was about the Australian commander of the so-called "United Nations forces," Roy King, presenting the Australian flag to Walton H. Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, on behalf of Australia. Walker was smiling so wide in the photo that his teeth were showing. The other was a dispatch from Chicago in which retired former commander of the US Third Fleet, Halsey, boasted that MacArthur was "one of the greatest military leaders in history," even saying: "As the commander of the occupation forces in Japan, he managed the country so wisely and kindly that he dared to transfer all the American occupation forces from Japan to Korea."
    Not long after this newspaper was published, less than a month later, things changed on the Korean battlefield. Under the severe blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, MacArthur and Walker's "rapid advance" became a "rapid retreat." American and European newspapers, however, used terms like "stupid," "mistake," "adventure," and "military politicians" to describe these two "generals"!
  (II)
    Imperialist "generals" and their newspapers have the same knack for bragging and deception, readily using slogans like "occupy all of Korea before Thanksgiving" and "return home before Christmas" to mobilize their soldiers, and using the lure of sex and sinful adventure to anesthetize their mercenaries. Abundant evidence of this can be found in the books and newspapers abandoned by the enemy on the battlefield. The second page of "Stars and Stripes" often featured women's legs and extremely boring pornographic cartoons. Its pictorial supplements were almost entirely filled with photos of naked stars and dancers. Several pictorials were filled with bizarre comic strips, even depicting thieves soaring down from high-rise cliffs to escape detectives, and adventurous "heroes" swimming into the seabed to rescue people from trains that had fallen into deep water. Novels of tens of thousands of words described how gangs of robbers murdered and looted...
    Why do the American rulers provide their troops with such spiritual food? The answer is simple: Corner, a soldier of the US 25th Infantry Division who was captured in this campaign, said: "The officers told us that we could get beautiful women and money in Korea, and that's why they gave us guns and war."
    What do the families of American invading soldiers think? Here is a letter from Tinny, the wife of American soldier Richard A Nixon, written to him on October 4th. It reads in part: "Imagine how lonely and gloomy I am tonight." "When I heard that the Allied forces were on the 38th parallel, I had such great hope that my beloved would be home soon. But the news was not good, our troops were to cross that line and advance. I prayed that this would not happen, but fantasies and prayers were in vain." After saying many sweet words, this woman added: "Today is Wednesday, and the first week of October is almost over. Are you thinking: if this were next year, you could be discharged from the army. Let's hope the war doesn't last that long. Dear, you've been there for almost four months, it feels like a million years, doesn't it?" She then described how it was starting to get cold at home, "Is it still the rainy season in Korea? I really hope not, because you have to fight, eat, and sleep in that kind of weather."
    However, this soldier was very likely a victim of the war waged by Wall Street bosses for the pursuit of profit, and probably would not return to Ms. Tinny in "a million years."
  (III)
    What are the unspeakable purposes of American imperialists in launching the war of aggression? Here, we captured a booklet published by the Intelligence and Education Section of the US Far East Command Headquarters, entitled "Fighting for America." This book is used for internal "education" of the US military, using many fine-sounding words such as "justice," "freedom," and "truth" to cover up its extremely vicious imperialist ambitions.
    The cover of this book is a map of the Korean Peninsula. But the border with China on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers is missing; on the map, a rifle with a sickle and hammer symbol of the Soviet Union, bayonet fixed, is extending from the direction of China, and the bayonet tip is piercing a map of the United States of America marked with the American flag. It is worth noting that this book was published long before the US military arrived in South Korea. The American imperialists not only fabricated the so-called "North Korean invasion" in their propaganda, but also openly stated that the Korean War was of "American interest," and had long since regarded China and the Soviet Union as its targets of war!
    What is blatant is the content of this booklet. It begins by saying: "This war is not to liberate a small piece of land far from home, nor is it entirely to protect an unfortunate small country that has been invaded by a barbaric, brutal communist gang." (Page 3 of the book). It answers later, "Let us never forget that in this war, we are fighting for ourselves." Then, this booklet blatantly states: "Korea borders Manchuria to the north, which is part of Communist China, and its northeast coast directly borders the Russian border and is only a few miles away from Russia's most important port in Siberia, Vladivostok" (Here, there is a map with four circles drawn on Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines—author's note). "Why is Korea so important to the United States and the United Nations that we have to wage a war in this tiny, remote corner of the world? The answer is very simple: only by fighting here now can we hope to avoid fighting in North America and the United States against Communist aggressors in the future." Look! How clear is this, the reason why American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea is precisely because this Korean place "borders" China's Northeast and is only "a few miles" away from the Soviet Union's Vladivostok.
    There are still telltale signs! This booklet introduces: "Geographically, the peninsula is divided into two unequal parts. The entire area is mountainous, with the southern half being flatter and agricultural, and the northern half being mountainous, rich in timber and minerals, and has greater potential for industrial development." (Page 40 of the book) "In addition to rice, some wheat, barley, soybeans, cotton, sweet radishes and potatoes, the country also produces various fruits, especially apples. ... Daegu apples are the most beautiful in the world." (Page 42 of the book) Look! This weasel is drooling!
  (IV)
    Can American imperialism achieve this goal? Let the American prisoners of war draw a conclusion: In the second campaign, according to only the preliminary statistics on the western front, were not 2,272 American soldiers and 5,353 puppet soldiers captured from November 25th to December 1st? Did not an entire American engineering company of 143 people surrender with their guns on the battlefield? One of our guards, while piling grass to camouflage a car near the battlefield, pulled a 19-year-old American soldier out of a pile of grass. The soldier immediately performed the American soldier's surrender gesture—kneeling on the ground, raising his hands, trembling all over...
    Black soldier Rogese said: "We still haven't put on cotton clothes in this cold weather. Every day, black people do the work of chopping firewood, washing vegetables, boiling water, cooking, and standing guard, and we can't even get enough to eat." "I didn't think I would live. You (referring to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers) take good care of us, give us medical treatment, and eat the same food. When I go back, I will tell more American soldiers, tell them that although I was captured, I was not killed, I live well, my human rights are guaranteed, and I am very free!"
    Spencer, a soldier of the US 25th Infantry Division, said: "Even if all Americans are drafted into the army, it won't help! The reason is that they don't want to fight, they don't know who they are fighting for. Around the 20th of last month, they said they would fight to the Yalu River, unify Korea, and eliminate the Communist army. For a month (according to the soldier, he was captured on November 28th—author's note), the goal has not been achieved. On the contrary, we are the ones who are being eliminated. It's not an offensive, it's a retreat! Cannons, tanks, and cars have also become your prisoners!"

    侵朝美军画像
    本报特约通讯员  李伟
          （一）
    当朝鲜战场上麦克阿瑟的“总攻势”被粉碎之后，我们在清川江以南价川一带的战场上寻获了一些美国报纸。其中有一期十月七日的《星条》报，第一版上刊载着两段令人作呕的新闻。一段是所谓“联合国军”中的澳军司令官罗伊·金代表澳国向美第八军军长瓦尔吞·Ｈ·瓦克献旗，瓦克在照片里笑得把牙都露出来了。另一段是从芝加哥来的通讯，退休的前美国第三舰队司令官海尔赛吹嘘麦克阿瑟是“历史上最伟大的军事领袖之一”，竟说：“作为日本占领军的司令官，他是这样明智地和善良地管理着这个国家，使他敢于把所有美国占领军从日本投入朝鲜。”
    曾几何时，距这张报纸出版不到一个月，朝鲜战场上便起了变化，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的严重打击下，麦克阿瑟和瓦克的“猛进”变成了“猛退”。美国和欧洲的报纸却用“愚蠢”、“错误”、“冒险”、“军事政客”等称号来奉送这两位“将军”了！
  （二）
    帝国主义的“将军”们和他的报纸有着同样吹牛的本领和欺骗的本领，善于用什么“感恩节前全部占领朝鲜”、“圣诞节前还乡”来作为对士兵们动员的口号，用色肉的引诱和罪恶的冒险来麻醉他们的雇佣兵。这从敌人遗弃在战场上的书籍报刊中可以找到丰富的材料。《星条》报的第二版上经常刊登些女人的大腿和无聊到极点的色情漫画，该报的画刊上更几乎都是些赤身露体的明星、舞女之类的照片。有几种画报，内容全部是离奇古怪的连环画，甚至描写盗贼如何从高楼悬崖上腾空而下，逃脱侦探的追踪，而擅长冒险的“侠客”竟能泅入到海底去从掉到深水中的火车里背出许多人来。洋洋数万言的小说，描写一群强盗如何杀人越货……
    美国的统治者为什么拿这样的精神食粮来供给他的军队呢？这个答案很简单：美国侵朝的第二十五步兵师的士兵康纳尔（Corner）在这次战役被俘后说：“长官讲的是到朝鲜来可以得到美女、金钱，为的是要给我们枪炮、战争。”
    美国侵略军士兵们的家人怎样看呢？下面是战场上的一封美军士兵李查德·尼克森（Richard A Nixon）的妻子坦妮（Tinny）在十月四日写给他的信，其中说道：“你想，今夜我是在寂寞与阴郁中。”“当我听说联军是在三八线上的时候，我抱着多么大的希望，我想我心爱的人回家的日子不会太长了。但消息并未那样好，我们的军队要越过那条线，并且前进。我曾祈祷这样的事不要发生，但幻想和祈祷落空了。”这个女人接着说了许多甜蜜的情话后，又说：“今天是星期三，十月的第一个星期差不多快过去了。你是否在想：假使这是明年的话，你就可以解除兵役了。让我们希望战争不要延续到那时。亲爱的，你已经到那儿差不多四个月之久了，那实在好像是一百万年了，不是吗？”她接着描写家乡已经开始冷了，“朝鲜是不是仍在雨季，我真希望不要那样，因为你们战斗、吃饭、睡觉，都要在那种气候里。”
    但是，这位士兵有很大的可能性做了美国华尔街老板们为追逐利润而进行的战争的牺牲品了，大概真的“一百万年”也回不到坦妮女士那儿去了。
  （三）
    美国帝国主义者发动侵略战争的不可告人的目的到底是什么呢？这里，我们缴获了一本美国远东军总司令部情报教育处出版的小册子《为美国而战》，这本书是美军对内“教育”用的，假借了许多“正义”、“自由”、“真理”等好听的名词，掩盖着极恶毒的帝国主义野心。
    这本书的封面是一个朝鲜半岛的图。但是和中国连鸭绿江、图们江的界限都没有；图上从中国的方向伸来一支标着苏联镰刀斧头符号、上着刺刀的步枪，刺刀尖上挑破了标着美国国旗的北美合众国的地图。值得注意的是：这本书出版远在美军才开到南朝鲜的时候。美帝不但在宣传品上制造了所谓“北朝鲜侵略”，而且公然说朝鲜战争为“美国利益”所关切，老早就以中国和苏联为其作战的目标了！
    露骨的是这本小册子的内容，一开头它便说道：“这个战争不是为了解放远离家乡的一小条土地，也不全是为了保护一个曾被一个野蛮、残忍的共产主义匪党所侵略的不幸的小国。”（该书第三页）它在后边解答说：“我们无论如何不要忘记，在这个战争里，我们是为我们自己”。接着，这本小册子露骨地说道：“朝鲜在北方与满洲交界，那里是共产党中国的一部分，东北海岸直接毗连俄国边境，且距离俄国在西伯利亚最重要的港口海参崴仅数英里”（这里，附有一张地图，在朝鲜、台湾、越南和菲律宾四处画了四个圆圈——作者注）。“为什么朝鲜对于美国和联合国这样重要，以致我们必须在这极小的、世界上极偏僻的角落里进行一个战争呢？答案非常简单：只有目前在这里打仗，才能使我们有希望日后避免在北美洲和美国为反对共产党侵略者作战。”你瞧！这有多么明白呢，美帝国主义者所以发动侵朝战争，正是因为这个朝鲜地方是和中国的东北“交界”是和苏联的海参崴距离“仅数英里”的原故。
    还有露马脚的地方哩！这本小册子介绍说：“在地理上讲，这个半岛分为两个不相等的部分。整个面积多山，南半部较平坦为农产区，北半部是山地，有丰富的木材和矿产，具有较大的工业发展潜力。”（该书第四十页）“这个国家除了出产大米，一些小麦、大麦、黄豆、棉花、甜萝卜和马铃薯以外，还有各种水果，特别是苹果。……大邱苹果是世界上最美的。”（该书第四二页）你瞧！这个黄鼠狼的口水都流出来了！
  （四）
    美帝国主义能否达到这一目的，还是让美俘来做结论吧：在第二个战役中，仅仅西线的极初步统计，由十一月二十五日到十二月一日不是俘掳了美军二千二百七十二个人和伪军五千三百五十三个人吗？不是有整整一个美国工兵连一百四十三个人在战场上缴枪投降吗？我们的一个警卫员在战场附近为了伪装汽车抱草的时候，从草堆里抱出一个十九岁的美国兵，那位士兵当时就来了一个美国士兵的投降式——跪在地下，举起双手，浑身颤抖着……
    黑人士兵罗吉斯（Rogese）说：“到现在这样冷的天气还没有穿上棉衣。每天劈柴，洗菜，烧水，煮饭，外加站岗放哨，都是黑人去干，饭也吃不饱。”“我没有想到我会活着，你们（指朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军）对我们照顾很好，给我们医伤，吃同样的饭。我回去的时候要告诉更多的美国士兵，告诉他们我虽然被俘，但没有被杀掉，生活很好，人权有保障，很自由！”
    美国步兵第二十五师的士兵斯宾塞（Speneer）说：“就是把美国人全拉来当兵也不顶事！原因是不愿打仗，不知道为谁打仗。在上月二十几号就说打到鸭绿江边，统一朝鲜，消灭共军。一个月来（按该士兵被俘是在十一月二十八日——作者）并没有达到目的。相反地，被消灭的是我们。不是进攻，而是退却！大炮、坦克、汽车，同样做了你们的俘虏！”
