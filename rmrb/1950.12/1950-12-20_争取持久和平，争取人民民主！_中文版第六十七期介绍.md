Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The 67th issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

The current issue features an editorial titled "The Great Gathering of People from All Countries Fighting for Peace," congratulating the opening of the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw. The editorial points out: The Second World Peace Congress, composed of outstanding scientists, writers, artists, prominent social figures, and religious figures from various countries, including industrial workers, farmers, office workers, and representatives from other social strata, is a true gathering of people from all countries. It is an event of the utmost world historical significance. Regardless of their political and religious beliefs and philosophical viewpoints, they all have the utmost confidence: the cause of peace can and will succeed! They represent hundreds of millions of people calling on the world: oppose war, ban atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, comprehensively reduce all types of armaments, stop any form of war propaganda, and condemn armed aggression and interference in the internal affairs of various countries. The editorial points out that in the eighteen months from the First World Peace Congress to this Second World Peace Congress, the world's peace forces have grown unprecedentedly strong. Millions of people from various countries have actively participated in the campaign to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee. Nearly five hundred million people have already signed the declaration. The editorial points out that the forces of peace are powerful and invincible, as Comrade Stalin pointed out: The strength of the friends of peace lies in the fact that their anti-war actions are based on the will of the broad masses. The people fighting for peace believe that their sacred and just cause will ultimately triumph. The people fighting for peace are deeply convinced that whether war breaks out depends entirely on their unity and organization, and on the extent of their concrete actions and joint efforts. The editorial concludes with the call: Peace will surely defeat war!

This issue also contains articles written by Wu Min, "The Industry of People's China is Growing," Hungarian Workers' Party Deputy General Secretary Gerő Ernő, "On the Stakhanovite Movement in People's Democratic Countries," and Italian Communist Party Assistant General Secretary Longo Luigi, "Striving for the Broad Unity and National Consensus of the Italian People," and other essays.
