The Doctrine is Unrighteous, the People are Even More Wicked
    ——Remembering the Words of Yiguandao "Machine Hand" Gao Yongzhou

    "Comrade, do you believe that binding a wooden stick to a hoop and having a person hold it to write on a sand table is 'God' speaking? This is completely Yiguandao's way of deceiving people. Those who don't understand the inside story are tricked into losing their families and fortunes, but I know the truth." Gao Yongzhou, who once served as a "machine hand" for eight or nine years for the Yiguandao bigwig Zhang Wufu, revealed Yiguandao's despicable and shameless tricks to us.

  The Truth About "Automatic Writing"

    Gao Yongzhou said: "In order to swindle money and wealth from the ignorant masses and confuse people's minds, Yiguandao trained many men and women to be 'Three Talents.' The 'Three Talents' didn't include married or older people; they were all unmarried young people around twenty years old, because he (she) understands little and is easy to exploit. Almost every 'altar' of Yiguandao has a set of 'Three Talents.' Among them, the 'Heaven Talent,' also called the 'machine hand,' is in charge of using a hoop bound with a wooden stick to write on the sand table. The 'Human Talent' reads out the written words, and the 'Earth Talent' then records the read-out words on paper. This set of ghostly tricks is called 'automatic writing,' also called 'opening the sand.' The written words are Yiguandao's 'altar instructions,' also called 'divine instructions,' meaning that the god uses the 'Heaven Talent's' hand to give instructions. Therefore, the 'Heaven Talent' is the most important of the 'Three Talents.' I myself was the 'Heaven Talent.' Having stayed in Yiguandao for many years, I know everything very clearly.

    "I joined the Dao at the age of eighteen. Because I was still clever, Liu Xinquan, a leader of Yiguandao in Tianjin, taught me to practice 'Heaven Talent,' memorizing 'scriptures' all day long, learning to compose parallel sentences and rhymed couplets, practicing writing regular script on the sand table with a wooden stick, and I was not allowed to leave the room, fearing that I would tell others. But the main thing was to teach me how to collude with the 'Point Transmitter' and act according to circumstances during 'automatic writing,' so that people would believe that a child who didn't understand much could recite incantations and match the hopes of those seeking divine help, that there must be a divine way and there would be no falsification. In fact, the 'Point Transmitter' had already hinted to me what kind of people were seeking divine help. Therefore, the 'altar instructions' that I made up with my eyes closed could generally be reasonable. Why can the 'altar instructions' rhyme? That's because I practiced so much. For example, before the Daoists burned the 'memorial,' I saw the names of the initiates on the 'memorial.' During 'automatic writing,' I incorporated their names into the 'divine instructions.' People who didn't know the details easily believed it and were deceived. If there was not enough time to understand the situation, I would make up the words vaguely based on experience. This is called cryptic language, but the purpose is nothing more than to ask the Daoists to give money to 'perform merit' and 'dedicate their hearts' to avoid disasters. If they didn't have money, they would be asked to 'dedicate themselves to promoting the Dao.' Over the years, too many Daoists have been deceived by this set of ghostly tricks during 'opening the altar,' 'establishing classes,' 'ferrying immortals,' and 'delivering souls.' Due to the endless 'performing merit' and 'dedicating the heart,' they dedicated all their family property and money. People like Zhou Chunshan and Zhang Wenfu are countless. Sometimes, the 'machine hand' also pretends to be 'a certain god' borrowing my body. This is called 'borrowing a shell' to pretend to be a god, claiming to be 'Living Buddha Jigong,' 'Immortal White Phoenix,' and the like, deceiving ignorant Daoists.

    "Comrade, after hearing what I just said, you might think that we 'Three Talents' have power and influence in Yiguandao, right? In fact, that's not the case. The 'Point Transmitters' are afraid that we 'Three Talents' will reveal the secret to the outside world and 'betray the Dao and ruin virtue,' so they not only don't allow us to talk to outsiders, but also don't allow 'machine hands' to talk to each other, saying that once 'collusion' occurs, it won't work. Fearing that we would quit halfway, they gave us a fantasy. Gong Pengling told me to do a good job as a 'machine hand.' Over time, I would reach the point of 'spiritual merging,' 'spiritual suppression,' and 'spiritual elevation,' meaning that I could merge with God into one. Comrade, think about it, the 'altar instructions' are all made up by me, so what god is there? Once I think it through, no one will believe this ghostly talk anymore. But many 'Earth Talents' and 'Human Talents' don't know the inside story and think there really is a divine way. Ordinary Daoists, needless to say. In fact, it's all the 'Heaven Talent' playing tricks alone!"

    Gao Yongzhou has been working with this sand table for eight or nine years, and many people have been deceived and confused. He said: "Now that I'm liberated, I can't let people be deceived anymore. I not only confessed to the government, but I also want to expose the crimes of Yiguandao to everyone!"

  Endless Criminal Facts

    Gao Yongzhou then exposed the Yiguandao's crimes of harming ignorant Daoists by running "furnace gatherings." In April 1939 (February 28th of the lunar calendar), in order to develop its organization, Yiguandao ran a "furnace gathering," also called "Shuntian Society," in Langjia Hutong outside Di'anmen. More than 180 people, including "Point Transmitters," "Altar Masters," and "Three Talents," participated, engaging in reckless behavior under the pretext of testing "wine, lust, wealth, and anger," and "settling debts." As a result, two female Daoists were brutally beaten to death, and most of the other Daoists were also beaten and swindled out of a lot of property.

    How were the two female Daoists beaten to death? Gao Yongzhou said: "At that time, the 'Shuntian Society' was run by male 'Point Transmitter' Liu Xinquan and female 'Point Transmitter' Qi Yuzhen. The two were secretly having an affair in the meeting. Unexpectedly, Li Dezhong, the wife of Liu Mengrong, the altar master and manager of a Tianjin automobile shop, who was assigned to serve them, saw it. Liu and Qi held a grudge and used the excuse of testing Li Dezhong's 'settlement of debts.' Liu Xinquan used a carrying pole and a wooden stick with nails to beat Li until she rolled on the ground screaming miserably, dying and reviving, on the verge of death. A Mrs. Ge from Suiyuan, a Daoist next to her, couldn't bear to watch and knelt down to beg for mercy, asking to take the beating for Li Dezhong. Liu Xinquan turned around and desperately beat her. The two female disciples, Li and Ge, were beaten to death miserably. Liu Xinquan felt that this was a big deal, so he quickly bribed the pseudo-police station, which colluded with Yiguandao, to secretly carry the bodies away for burial. Liu Xinquan was also afraid of the impact in the Dao, so he opened an altar for Li Dezhong, claiming that she had become an immortal, and sent Liu Mengrong to Suiyuan to be the local 'Dao leader'; he arranged for the sister of Wang Bitu, the altar master and manager of a Chinese-Western pharmacy in Tianjin, to marry Mrs. Ge's husband. He also forced the Daoists to sign a guarantee not to talk to outsiders. Two lives were thus ended under Yiguandao's sinister deceit." Then Gao Yongzhou told me about the crimes of the upper-level members of Yiguandao raping women. He said: "'Point Transmitter' Liu Xinquan had long been eyeing Jin Shuyun, the female altar master in Tianjin. During this 'furnace gathering,' Qi Yuzhen brought them together and forced Jin Shuyun to marry him under a false pretext, and gave Jin Shuyun a new name called 'Jin Tan,' meaning that this marriage was just a flash in the pan and he wouldn't be responsible for it in the future."

    Yiguandao also concocted various torturous names in the "furnace gathering," calling them "tests." Gao Yongzhou said: "Usually, when eating every day, only a little pickled vegetables were given. One day, a lot of pickled vegetables were suddenly bought, and everyone ate more. Unexpectedly, after the meal, they sealed the water tank and boiler, and didn't give everyone a drop of water to drink for a day and a night. The next day, they let everyone drink as much water as possible, and at night they sealed all the toilets and didn't let people urinate. Some people urinated in their pants! Later, they put urine in the water and let everyone drink it, saying that the more sincere people drank, the more they drank... Once, at night, there was a 'flying knife to kill demons.' In the middle of the night, while everyone was asleep, all the clothes and shoes were taken away. But the yard was full of loud noises, shouting to catch the demons. But everyone couldn't find their clothes. They saw a fluffy white shadow running back and forth in the yard. At this time, Liu Xinquan came in, and everyone knelt down to plead guilty. Liu Xinquan said that this was training the 'true soul,' removing the evil (homophone with shoe) and the false body (referring to taking away clothes). Everyone is not ordinary people! Originally, a person wore a fur coat inside out, set off firecrackers, and pretended to be a monster to deceive everyone. How could there be any monsters! When 'testing sex,' a male and female Daoist were forced to walk back and forth in front of everyone completely naked, asking if it looked good or not. When 'testing wealth,' there were many more items, saying that people have grudges in the 'six paths of reincarnation' and should pay money to atone for their sins. The more you pay, the more sins you atone for... Similar things are endless. Every day, except for two hours of sleep, it was testing this and testing that. If you said something wrong, you would be beaten."

    Gao Yongzhou said: "Yiguandao uses superstition to confuse people's minds, and colludes with the reactionaries to do things against the people. Every leader is hypocritical, internally fighting each other, and not upright at all. I have been in the Dao for thirteen years, and I have seen through the things inside. There is no 'Dao' at all. It is completely the Yiguandao leaders using some names to swindle money from the Daoists, rape women, and satisfy their selfish desires."

    道不正·人更邪
    ——记一贯道“机手”高永周的话
    “同志，你相信在罗圈上绑着一根木棍儿，用人的手把着在沙盘上写字，就是‘神’在讲话吗？这完全是一贯道用来骗人的，不明白内幕的人便被骗得家破人亡，但是我可知道根底。”曾经给一贯道大头子张五福充当过八、九年“机手”的高永周，对我们揭穿了一贯道卑鄙无耻的骗人伎俩。
  “扶乩”的真象
    高永周说：“一贯道为了骗取无知群众钱财，迷惑人心，便训练了许多男女当‘三才’，‘三才’里没有结了婚和年纪大的，全都是二十岁左右的未婚青年，因为他（她）们懂事不多，最好利用。一贯道的每一个‘坛’，差不多都有一份‘三才’，其中‘天才’也叫‘机手’，他专管用罗圈绑着木棍在沙盘上写字，‘人才’是把写出的字念出来，‘地才’再把念出的字记录在纸上。这套鬼把戏便叫做‘扶乩’，也叫做‘开沙’。写出的字就是一贯道的‘坛训’，又叫‘神训’，意思是神借着‘天才’的手来训话。所以‘天才’是‘三才’中最重要的一个。我自己就是‘天才’，在一贯道里呆的年头多了，啥事都知道得很清楚。
    “我是十八岁入的道，因为我还机灵，所以一贯道天津的一个头子刘新泉，便教给我练‘天才’，整天背‘经书’，学着作四、六句，七、五言的流口辙，拿着木棍在沙盘上练写行书，并且不许出房门一步，怕我向别人说。但主要的还是教我怎样和‘点传师’串通一气，在‘扶乩’时见机行事，以使人们相信一个不很懂事的孩子能念念有词，而且与求神的人们的希望符合，一定是有神道，不会有假。其实，‘点传师’早就暗示给我知道求神的是什么人，因此，我闭上眼睛编出来的‘坛训’，大致都能合情合理。为什么‘坛训’都能合辙押韵呢？那是因为练得熟了的缘故。像道徒入道时烧‘表文’以前，我便从‘表文’上看到了入道的姓名等等，到‘扶乩’时，我便把他们的名字编到‘神训’里，不知底细的人很容易信以为真，便上了当。如果临时来不及了解，我便凭着经验把话编得糊里糊涂一些，这叫隐语，但目的不外是要道徒拿钱来‘行功’、‘献心’以免灾难，没钱便叫他们‘舍身办道’。这些年来，道徒们在‘开坛’、‘立班’、‘渡仙’、‘超拔’时，被这套鬼把戏蒙住的可太多了。由于没有止境的‘行功’、‘献心’，而把家产钱财献光了的，像周纯身、张文甫等真是数也数不清。有时，‘机手’还伪装‘某某神’借了我的身子，这叫做‘借壳’装神弄鬼，自称什么‘济公活佛’、‘白凤大仙’之类，欺骗无知道徒。
    “同志，你听了我刚才所说的，就以为我们当‘三才’的人在一贯道里是有权有势了吧？实际上不是那么回事儿，‘点传师’们怕我们‘三才’向外泄底，‘反道败德’，所以不但不许我们向外人讲，还不许‘机手’和‘机手’谈论，说是一旦‘串机’便不灵了。怕我们中途不干了，所以又给我们一个幻想。龚彭龄就对我说过，叫我好好干‘机手’，日久天长，便会达到‘合灵’、‘压灵’、‘提灵’的地步，意思是和神能融合到一体。同志，你说说看，‘坛训’都是我编的，还有什么神，一想开了，谁也不会再信这套鬼话。但是许多的‘地才’、‘人才’便不知道底细，以为是真有神道，一般的道徒更不必说了。其实都是‘天才’一个人捣的鬼！”
    高永周搞这个沙盘有八、九年了，许多人被骗得迷迷糊糊的。他说：“解放了我不能再让人受骗了，我不但向政府坦白了，而且还要向大家揭穿一贯道的罪恶！”
  罪恶事实说不尽
    高永周接着又揭发了一贯道开办“炉会”残害无知道徒的罪行。一九三九年四月（旧历二月二十八日）一贯道为了发展组织，在地安门外郎家胡同开办“炉会”，又叫“顺天会”，参加的人有“点传师”、“坛主”、“三才”等一百八十余人，借考“酒色财气”、“了冤欠”等等名目胡作非为，结果两个女道徒被毒打惨死，其他的道徒也大部被打，并被骗去许多财物。
    两个女道徒是怎样被打死的？高永周说：“当时‘顺天会’是由男‘点传师’刘新泉和女‘点传师’齐玉贞负责，两人在会中暗地通奸，不料被指派侍候他们的坛主天津某汽车行经理刘孟荣之妻李德忠看见，刘、齐两人怀恨在心，就借故考李德忠的‘了冤欠’，由刘新泉用扁担和带钉子的木棍把李打得在地上翻滚惨叫，死去活来，奄奄一息，旁边的道徒中有个从绥远来的葛太太，看不下去了，就跪下求饶，要求替李德忠挨打，刘新泉就扭过头来拚命地打她，李、葛两个女徒，就这样凄惨地一同被打死了。刘新泉感到这事儿大了，连忙疏通和一贯道勾结在一起的伪警察局私下抬埋。刘新泉又怕在道中有影响，便为李德忠开了一坛，诡称她成了什么仙，并派刘孟荣到绥远做当地的‘道长’；把天津坛主中西大药房经理王璧图之妹给葛太太之夫说上媒。还强迫着道徒们具结不向外讲，两条人命在一贯道阴毒诡骗下便如此了结。”接着高永周又告诉我一贯道上层分子奸污妇女的罪行。他说：“‘点传师’刘新泉早就看上天津女坛主金淑云，在这次‘炉会’中，便由齐玉贞撮合，巧借名目，强与金淑云结婚，并给金淑云改个名字叫‘金昙’，意思说这次结婚只是昙花一现，以后不负责任。”
    一贯道在“炉会”中还巧立各种非刑名目，称之为“考”，高永周说：“平常每日吃饭时，只给少许咸菜，有一天忽然买了许多咸菜，大家就多吃，不料饭后他们竟把水缸，锅炉都封上了，一天一夜不给大家一点水喝，隔一天又尽量让大家喝水，到晚上又把所有厕所都封了，不让撒尿，有的就尿了裤子！后来又把水里对尿让大家喝，说越真诚的人喝的才越多。还有一次夜里来了回‘飞刀斩妖’，半夜趁大家睡熟，把所有的衣服、鞋都拿走了，但听院里乒乓乱响，呼嚷捉魔，但大家都找不到衣服，只见院里一个白茸茸的影子，来回乱跑，正在这时刘新泉进来了，大家跪下求罪，刘新泉说这是训练‘真灵魂’，除邪（与鞋音同）去了假躯壳（指拿走衣服），大家都不是凡人啦！原来事先由一个人反穿皮袄，燃爆竹，扮做妖怪而欺骗着大家，那里有什么妖怪啊！‘考色’时，强迫男女道徒各一人全身赤裸着，在大家面前走来走去，问好看不好看。‘考财’时，那名目就多了，说人在‘六道轮回’中都有怨仇，应当拿钱折罪，越出得多的折去的罪越多……类似这样的事情说也说不完，每天除了睡觉两小时以外，就是考这样，考那样，说错了便受到毒打。”
    高永周说：“一贯道是借着迷信，惑乱人心，又和反动派勾结在一起，尽做反人民的事，每个头子都是一套虚伪，内部勾心斗角，一点不正派。我入道十三年，里面的事都看穿了，那里有什么‘道’，完全是一贯道的头子们假借些名目向道徒骗财，奸淫妇女，来满足他们的私欲。”
