Beijing Youth League Members Fight to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and Consolidate National Defense!
By our special correspondent Wang Shigu

I. The League Congress Clarified Thinking

For the past year and a half, Beijing Youth League members have been active in schools, factories, rural areas, and government offices. They have actively responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, becoming models in carrying out various work tasks. Thanks to the League's extensive political and ideological education, League members and youth have made progress. The League has strengthened its ranks, now with 35,000 members.

In the past, League members were not clear enough in their political thinking. To this end, the first Beijing Municipal Congress of the Communist Youth League, held in mid-October, clearly pointed out that Youth League members must first be ideologically advanced and arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, because the Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth. In addition to doing a good job in production, studies, and other work, each League member must also do League work. Otherwise, the League cannot become the Party's assistant and reserve force. The League's education must be strengthened, and it should be clear that the League is a school for the Party to educate young people with Marxism-Leninism, and education on current political issues should be conducted regularly.

After the conference resolutions were conveyed, most League members felt that "this should have been done long ago, this is what a Youth League should be like"; some League members read the League Constitution overnight and reviewed their past shortcomings. This was actually a political mobilization of the entire League, which increased everyone's enthusiasm, and many League cadres and members felt "more energetic in their work!"

II. Played a Role in the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Movement

"More energetic in work!" is first reflected in the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement. In this movement, the Beijing Youth League played the role of an advanced youth organization, greatly improving its ideology, combat effectiveness, and organization.

League members have become more clear-sighted ideologically in distinguishing between themselves and the enemy, and have expressed their irreconcilable hatred for US imperialism. At accusation meetings, forums, and street propaganda in various factories and schools, League members took the lead in accusing imperialism of atrocities. League members also propagandized to the masses, becoming the organizers and active members of propaganda work in various units. Some are learning to do propaganda work anytime and anywhere; 95% of the League members in the Shijingshan Power Plant can do this. Wang Sheng, a League member and line worker at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, told people about current affairs issues whenever he saw them. He explained cartoons about Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in front of the Telecommunications Bureau No. 7 every day, propagating to the masses, and was called "Wang Sheng's Big-Character Poster" by his coworkers.

League members also mobilized young people to actively fight against reactionary thoughts and behaviors, and to persuade those with erroneous ideas. The Youth League, in this way, expressed its clear political stance, which was rare before the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement. Now, under the leadership of the Party, it dares to carry out irreconcilable struggles to safeguard correct principles. League members in schools such as Xinsheng Middle School exposed and resolutely opposed the reactionary remarks of some teachers. The League branch of Women's No. 2 Middle School openly discussed rumors among the masses, shattering the conspiracy of rumor-mongering. Xinhua Middle School and other schools launched struggles against individual special agents within the school.

The League's experience in this movement proves that the Party's leadership is the most important reliance for the Youth League's work. But in such a broad mass movement, it is necessary to maintain the League's system of leadership and let the League's organizations and members move so that work can be carried out better. Many units of the League organization assign specific tasks to League members, actively participate in work, and strive to learn and publicize current events. The enthusiasm of League members has been brought into play, the League has become active, and the movement has become easier to carry out. Because the Youth League played a role in the movement, it strengthened its own unity and its ties with the masses.

III. Always Ready to Fight to Consolidate National Defense

The tide of patriotism continues to rise. Currently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League is calling on League members and youth throughout the city to adhere to the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea movement until final victory with practical actions such as being always prepared to participate in national defense construction and working hard in production and study.

Since the start of the movement, the Municipal Committee of the League has successively received dozens of letters from League members to Chairman Mao or League leaders, expressing their willingness to devote themselves to the motherland, participate in the battle, and spare no sacrifice, even their own lives. Some also stated their determination to do a good job in production, study, and work before leaving their posts. Fifty-one students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University have gloriously joined the People's Navy, 38 of whom are League members.

Many fighting teams have been organized among young people, using names such as Paul Kochakin, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Matrosov, Li Landing, and White-Clad Warrior as their own, learning from the example of these heroic figures. The Danya Fighting Team, organized by seventeen League members and two students from Class A of the second year of Women's No. 3 Middle School, solemnly swore: "We inherit Danya's spirit of loving the motherland and fighting bravely, and resolutely take up arms to fight to defend the motherland!"

These facts are the best guarantee. Every Youth League member will rush to respond to the call of the motherland.

### 北京青年团员  为抗美援朝巩固国防而战斗！

    北京青年团员  为抗美援朝巩固国防而战斗！
    本报特约通讯员  王士谷
    一、团代会明确了思想
    一年半来，北京青年团员们活跃在学校、工厂、农村和机关。他们积极响应中国共产党和人民政府的号召，成为执行各项工作任务的模范。由于团进行了广泛的政治思想教育，团员和青年都进步了。团壮大了自己的队伍，现有三万五千团员。
    过去团员在政治思想上是不够明确的。为此，十月中旬举行的青年团北京市第一届代表大会明确指出：青年团员首先要思想进步，要用马列主义毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来，因为青年团是先进青年的群众性的组织。每个团员除了搞好生产、功课等本身工作以外，还必须做团的工作。否则团就不可能成为党的助手与后备军。团的教育必须加强，应明确团是党以马列主义教育青年的学校，要经常进行关于时事政治问题的教育。
    大会决议经传达后，大多数团员认为“早就应该如此做，这才像个青年团的样子”；一部分团员连夜阅读团章，检讨了自己过去的缺点。这实际上是对全团进行了一次政治动员，提高了大家的积极性，许多团的干部和团员觉得“工作起来更有劲了！”
    二、在抗美援朝运动中发挥了作用
    “工作起来更有劲了！”首先表现在抗美援朝运动中。在这个运动里，北京青年团发挥了先进青年组织的作用，大大提高了自己的思想性、战斗性和组织性。
    团员从思想上更加清楚地分清了自己和敌人，都表示了自己对美帝国主义不共戴天的仇恨。在各工厂、学校的控诉会、座谈会上和街头宣传中，团员们带头控诉帝国主义暴行。团员们并向群众宣传，成为各单位宣传工作的组织者与积极分子。有的正学习着随时随地做宣传工作，石景山发电厂百分之九十五的团员都能做到这一点。北京电信局线路工人团员王升把自己所知道的时事问题见人就讲，他在电话七局门口每天讲解抗美援朝的漫画，向群众宣传，被工友们称为“王升大字报”。
    团员们并发动青年，积极和反动的思想和行为作斗争，对错误的思想进行说服。青年团像这样表示自己鲜明的政治立场，在抗美援朝运动以前是很少的，现在却敢于在党的领导下为维护正确的原则而进行不调和的斗争。新生中学等校的团员揭露并坚决反对某些教师中的反动言论。女二中团支部把谣言公开在群众中讨论，粉碎了造谣的阴谋。新华中学等校对校内的个别特务分子展开了斗争。
    团在这次运动中的经验证明：党的领导是青年团工作的最主要的倚靠，但在这样一个广泛的群众运动中，必须保持团的系统领导，让团的组织和团员们都动起来，才能更好地开展工作。许多单位团的组织分配给团员以具体任务，积极参加工作，努力学习与宣传时事。发挥了团员的积极性，团活跃起来了，运动就更易于开展。青年团由于在运动中发挥了作用，加强了本身的团结和与群众的联系。
    三、时刻准备着为巩固国防而斗争
    爱国主义的热潮在继续高涨。目前青年团北京市委正号召全市团员及青年以时刻准备着参加国防建设，努力生产学习等实际行动来坚持抗美援朝运动到最后的胜利。
    运动开始以后，团市委已陆续收到数十封团员写给毛主席或团的领导同志的信，表示自己愿意献身祖国，参加战斗，不惜任何牺牲甚至自己的生命。有的并说明在离开本岗位以前决心好好生产、学习、工作。北大、清华、燕京三大学已有五十一个同学光荣地参加了人民海军，其中三十八个是团员。
    青年中组织了许多战斗的队伍，以保尔·柯察金，丹娘，马特洛索夫，李蓝丁，白衣战士等作为自己的名字，学习这些英雄人物的榜样。女三中高二甲十七个团员和两个同学组织的丹娘战斗队庄严地宣誓：“我们继承丹娘热爱祖国英勇战斗的精神，坚决拿起武器为保卫祖国而战斗！”
    这些事实就是最好的保证。每一个青年团员都会争先恐后地响应祖国的号召。
