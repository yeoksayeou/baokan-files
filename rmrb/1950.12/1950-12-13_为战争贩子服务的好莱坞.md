Hollywood Serving the Warmongers
O. Fei'o'fanuofu

The screens of all Marshallized countries are occupied by Hollywood's cinematic concoctions. The purpose of these "standardized" products is to turn a normal person into a mental patient, an idiot, and a professional killer.

In the United States, film production and atomic bomb production are in the hands of the same group of people. The American ruling class, in its absurd plan to conquer the world, pays great attention to the propaganda of a new war. This propaganda is carried out by the yellow press and radio broadcasts that spew out rumors and slanders day and night, as well as films that cultivate unchanging, beastly instincts.

American art, newspapers, and radio—all are becoming fascistized. In this program, the fascistization of Hollywood is by no means in last place.

Hollywood has always been a factory for producing vulgar and reactionary films, so it is difficult to suspect Hollywood of sympathizing with the Communists. However, under the leadership of Thomas and Rankin, the "Un-American" Activities Investigation Committee—Americans call it the "Anti-American Committee"—is starting to clean up Hollywood.

The famous German progressive writer Thomas Mann wrote about this: "...I recognize this kind of tendency with great pain. Spiritual distress, political persecution, the gradual demise of legal principles, and all of this seems to be for the sake of an 'extraordinary situation'—that's how it started in Germany at the time. Then came fascism, and after fascism, war."

The methods used by Thomas and Rankin to "investigate" Hollywood are the same despicable methods used by the Fascists in the "Reichstag fire" case in Leipzig. The famous American writer Albert Maltz, the performer of "Crossfire," a film exposing racial discrimination, wrote in his statement: "Thomas and Rankin... are carrying out the kind of activities in the United States that Goebbels and Himmler once carried out in Germany." He didn't say this by chance.

The committee's "activities" have expelled a small number of progressive elements from Hollywood, most of whom are Hollywood screenwriters and directors. The production of a few films that, although naive, somewhat truthfully reflected Soviet life is inseparable from their names. These films include: *Song of Russia*, *Mission to Moscow*, and *North Star*. In addition, these directors also made several films against German fascism and against American fascism, such as *Tender Comrade*.

According to the decision of the "Un-American" Activities Investigation Committee, progressive directors and writers such as John Howard Lawson, Dalton Trumbo, Albert Maltz, Alvah Bessie, and Edward Dmytryk were thrown into prison. However, prison cannot destroy their will to fight for peace and victory. In their letter to the Fifth International Film Festival in Karlovy Vary this June, they wrote: "We believe that film art can become a powerful propaganda tool for peace. We ourselves have tried to use films as weapons of peace in our country, but monopolistic capitalists have deprived us of our work... But we believe in the power of peace."

The "cleaning up" of Hollywood is not limited to expelling progressive elements. American business giants believe that Hans, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, cannot promote policies that further fascistize Hollywood. Although Hans is also a typical money worshiper and a loyal lackey of Wall Street, he was replaced by Eric Johnston, the former president of the Chamber of Commerce. The task assigned to the latter is to turn films into direct weapons of the warmongers. Sent to help him was the well-known Byrnes—former U.S. Secretary of State.

Johnston, assuming the function of Wall Street's governor in Hollywood, enthusiastically promoted Goebbels' methods in Hollywood. Shortly before taking office, Johnston frankly stated his views on film art: "No one understood the significance of film as a political and strategic tool better than the leaders of the German National Socialist Party. Goebbels' successful experiments in film prove that if films can be made according to our wishes, they can successfully serve the United States, just as they once served the Nazis."

Following this program, Hollywood businessmen have banned many films in which riots can be seen. The extent to which these Hollywood fascists reach absurdity in flattering their superiors can be seen from the following fact. Not long ago, Hollywood's "Monogram Pictures" decided to stop making a film based on the epic *The Song of Hiawatha* by the 19th-century American classical writer Longfellow. According to a report by a *New York Times* reporter, this decision was made out of fear that a film about Hiawatha's life and deeds "...in the current domestic mood, may be regarded as a call for peace, and this is beneficial to the Communists." Commentary is superfluous here.

The following fact is also very characteristic. In a Hollywood cartoon, the fantasy-filled Hollywood producers actually used the melody of "The Internationale" to accompany the music. Inserting the melody of a revolutionary song into maudlin jazz music is simply unprecedented in the madness of film merchants.

Fascistized Hollywood produces many malicious films that crudely oppose the peace movement and slander the Soviet Union. The Wall Street businessmen and warmongers like Churchill are the real creators of these so-called "anti-communist" films.

Among this kind of malicious satirical movies, the most famous is *The Iron Curtain*.

In fact, the term "Iron Curtain" was borrowed from the repertoire of the nouveau riche Goebbels, and it was transferred from the Nuremberg archives to the United States with the concern of Churchill, who is enthusiastically preserving the fascist mantle. *The Iron Curtain*, which called for an anti-Soviet war, was a shameful failure. Thanks to the efforts of peace advocates, this crude forgery was banned from being shown on many screens around the world. People who defend peace refused to watch this false film. Hollywood speculators could not recoup the cost of making this film. Johnston tried to comfort his subordinates, declaring that Hollywood's attention to business propaganda at this moment "exceeds the profitable sale of films."

In addition to *The Iron Curtain*, there are other maliciously propagandistic films. American audiences are responding weakly to all these fake movies.

Hollywood products are exported to the screens of Marshallized countries, and along with these products comes the preaching of hatred of humanity. The instigators of a new world war, using Hollywood films to obscure the screens of the United States and Marshallized countries, want to convince the people of all countries that war is inevitable, and that they should die for the "American way of life"—this "American way of life" brings new profits to American stock traders and poverty to workers.

Hollywood promotes various methods of aggression, cultivates racial hatred, and ignites war hysteria. In the sensational *Gilda*, the atomic bomb is promoted. Not content with the atomic bomb, RKO Pictures is making a film about the "hydrogen bomb." William Wellman, the performer of *The Iron Curtain*, recently completed *Battleground*, in which he once again promotes anti-Soviet war. This film is the first in a series of films, the purpose of which is to show that aggressive war will be an interesting game for the "ever-victorious" American army.

In addition to obvious aggressive films, Wall Street's film propagandists continue to produce a large number of yellow, vulgar detective films. These films cause moral degradation and divide the ranks of peace defenders, luring workers away from the important task of opposing warmongers.

Who are the protagonists of Hollywood films? Abraham Lincoln? Or, an ordinary worker in New York, or a cotton farmer in Louisiana? No! Hollywood's protagonists are crooks and madmen, lynchers, Chicago gangsters, turtles, and prostitutes. In terms of its degrading influence, Hollywood films can not only compete with the films of Hitler's Third Reich, but often surpass them. The names of many films can illustrate the demise of American morality. In the colorful advertisements of Broadway, you can see: *Killer King*, *In the Land of Death*, *Death at the Crossroads*, *Okay, You Kill Me*, *Murder, Inc.*, and *The Killers*.

Propaganda of misanthropy and racism, murder cases full of mysterious perversions, naked narrative themes, and undisguised pornography—these are the characteristics of Hollywood movies. For example, in New York, among the films released in recent months, no less than 80% are glorifying prostitution and looting. The number of Americans watching this kind of vulgar thing is decreasing. Hollywood film box office sales are declining year by year.

Even in the highly questionable American statistics, unprecedented criminal acts are listed. A major crime occurs in the United States every seventeen seconds. Hollywood producers have a lot of credit in this regard, because their films corrupt the audience and lure them to commit crimes.

The corrupt themes of American films have greatly reduced the already pitiful "artistic" level of Hollywood. The production of Hollywood films, like the production of rifles and "Flying Fortresses," inevitably leads to pitiful handicraft production, stereotypes, and monotony. The muse of art cannot reside in the gardens of businessmen and in places ruled by police whips, where art becomes business, becomes a circulating, money-making commodity.

Film is a sophisticated ideological weapon. Hollywood today is arming Wall Street, just like the "Flying Fortresses," the Un-American Activities Investigation Committee, military bases, and Mr. Truman himself. If you look carefully at the screen, under the sweet smiles of Hollywood stars, you can see the beastly teeth of Wall Street's haters of humanity.

    为战争贩子服务的好莱坞
    Ｏ·费奥法诺夫
    一切马歇尔化国家的银幕都被好莱坞的电影料理所占领。这些“标准化”产品的目的，是在于把一个正常的人变成精神病者、白痴和职业性的杀人犯。
    在美国，影片的生产和原子弹的生产，是握在同一批人的手里的。美国的统治集团在自己征服世界的荒唐计划里，非常注意新战争的宣传。进行这种宣传的，有日夜吐出谣言和诽谤的浊流的黄色报刊和无线电广播，以及培养不变的、兽性的本能的电影。
    美国的艺术、报刊、无线电——全都变得法西斯化了。在这个纲领里，好莱坞的法西斯化并非占着末位。
    好莱坞永远是一所制造下流和反动影片的工厂，因此很难使人疑心好莱坞是同情共产党的。然而，在汤姆斯和雷金的领导下，“反美”活动调查委员会——美国人就叫它“反美委员会”，——却在动手刷清好莱坞了。
    德国著名的进步作家汤麦斯·曼关于这一点，写道：“……我很苦痛地认识这一类倾向。精神的难堪、政治的迫害、法理的逐渐灭亡，而且这一切似乎都是为了‘非常局势’，——在德国当时就是这样开始的。接着是法西斯主义，而在法西斯主义之后则是战争。”
    汤姆斯和雷金“调查”好莱坞所用的方法，就是法西斯党徒在列普济的“焚烧国会”的那种卑鄙案件上所用的方法。美国的著名作家亚尔培·马尔茨，暴露种族歧视的“火烧的十字街”一片的演出者，在自己的声明里写道：“汤姆斯和雷金……在美国进行戈培尔和希姆莱在德国曾经进行过的那种活动。”他说这话不是偶然的。
    委员会的“活动”使为数不多的进步分子从好莱坞驱逐出去，其中多半还是好莱坞的编剧和导演。少数虽然幼稚，但却多少真实地反映一些苏联生活的影片的摄制，就是跟他们的名字分不开的。这些影片像：《俄罗斯之歌》（《战地之花》）、《出使莫斯科》和《北极星》。此外，这几位导演还摄制了几部反对德国法西斯主义和反对美国法西斯主义的影片，例如：《似水年华》。
    根据“反美”活动调查委员会的决定，像约翰·霍华德·鲁逊、达尔顿·特鲁姆波、亚尔培·马尔茨、阿尔华·贝西、爱德华·德米特里克等进步的导演和作家都被投入狱中。但是，监狱摧毁不了他们争取和平胜利的意志。今年六月在他们致卡罗维发利的第五届国际电影节的信里写道：“我们相信电影艺术可以成为和平的有力宣传工具。我们自己曾经想在我们的国家里利用影片作为和平的武器，但是独占资本家却剥夺了我们的工作……不过我们相信和平的力量。”
    好莱坞的“刷清”并不限于驱逐进步分子。美国的商业巨头们认为美国电影业协会主席汉斯还不能推行使好莱坞更进一步法西斯化的政策。虽然汉斯也是一个典型的拜金主义者和华尔街的忠实走狗，他却被前商会主席爱里克·琼斯顿所顶替。他们赋予后者的任务是把电影变成战争贩子的直接武器。被派遣帮他忙的是名气不小的贝纳斯——前美国国务卿。
    琼斯顿着手执行华尔街在好莱坞的总督职能，于是就热心地在好莱坞推行起戈培尔的手法来。在自己上任之前不久，琼斯顿毫不掩饰地叙述自己电影艺术的观点：“没有人比德国国社党的领导者们更明白了解电影用作政治和战略工具的意义。戈培尔在影片方面的成功实验，证明，如果影片能够照我们的心意摄制，它们就可以成功地为美国服务，正像它们曾经为纳粹分子服务一样。”
    好莱坞的生意人遵照这项纲领，禁止了不少其中可以看到暴动的影片。这些好莱坞的法西斯分子在奉承上司上达到怎样荒谬的程度，可以从下面的事实看出来。不久之前好莱坞的“蒙诺格兰影片公司”决定停止摄制根据美国十九世纪古典作家朗番罗的长诗《哈亚华德之歌》改编的影片。根据《纽约时报》记者的报导，这项决定是由于担心一张关于哈亚华德生平和事迹的影片……在目前国内的情绪中，可能被当作和平的呼吁，而这是有利于共产党的。”在这里正所谓评论是多余的。
    下面这件事实也是非常特征性的。在好莱坞的一张卡通片里，充满幻想的好莱坞制片家竟采用了“国际歌”的旋律来配作音乐。在肉麻的爵士音乐里插入革命歌曲的旋律，影片商的疯狂简直是没有先例的。
    法西斯化的好莱坞制造许多粗暴地反对和平运动、反对苏联的恶意诽谤的影片。华尔街的生意人以及像邱吉尔之流的战贩，就是这些所谓“反共”的真正制造者。
    在这类恶意讽刺的电影里，最著名的就是《铁幕》。
    事实上，“铁幕”这个名词就是从暴发户戈培尔的剧目单里借用来的，它是借着热心保存法西斯衣钵的邱吉尔的关心，而从纽伦堡的档案里被转运到美国来的。号召反苏战争的《铁幕》一片是可耻地失败了。由于拥护和平者的努力，这张粗鲁的伪造影片被禁止在世界各地的许多银幕上演。保卫和平的人们拒绝观看这张虚伪的影片。好莱坞的投机商无法补偿摄制这张影片的支出。琼斯顿企图安慰自己的手下人，他宣称：好莱坞此刻对事业宣传一方面的注意，“超过有利地出售影片”。
    除了《铁幕》之外，还有其他恶意宣传的影片。美国观众对所有这些伪造电影的反应是无力的。
    好莱坞的产品被输到马歇尔化国家的银幕，同时随着这些产品也输出了憎恨人类的说教。新的世界大战的挑拨者，用好莱坞的影片来遮暗美国和马歇尔化国家的银幕，他们想说服各国人民战争是无法避免的，同时他们应该为“美国生活方式”而死，——这种“美国生活方式”给美国的股票商人带来新的利润，给劳动者带来贫穷。
    好莱坞宣传着各种侵略的方式，培养种族的憎恨，燃起战争的歇斯底里。在哄传一时的《基尔达》一片里，宣传着原子弹。雷电华影片公司嫌原子弹还不够，它更在摄制关于“氢弹”的影片。《铁幕》的演出者威廉·惠尔门不久之前完成了《巴斯顿》一片，在这张影片里他又在宣传反苏战争。这张影片是一套影片的第一张，而这套影片的目的却在于显示：侵略战争对于“常胜不败”的美国军队将是一种有趣的游戏。
    除了显明的侵略影片之外，华尔街的电影宣传员们继续出产大量黄色的、下流的侦探片。这些影片引起道德的堕落和分裂保卫和平者的队伍，引诱劳动者脱离反对战争贩子的重要任务。
    谁是好莱坞影片的主角？阿勃兰·林肯吗？还是，纽约的一个普通工人，或是路易西安拿的种植棉花的农民？不！好莱坞的主角是骗子和疯子、私刑犯、芝加哥的强盗、乌龟和娼妓。在自己使人堕落影响上说来，好莱坞的影片不但可以跟希特勒第三帝国的影片匹敌，而且常常是有过之而无不及。许多影片的名字就可以说明美国道德的沦亡。在百老汇的花花绿绿的广告里可以看到：《凶手大王》、《在死亡之国》、《十字路口的死》、《嗯，你杀死我吧，》、《杀人公司》以及《杀人犯》。
    宣传憎人主义和种族主义，充满神秘的变态性的凶杀案，赤裸裸地叙述性的题材和毫无掩饰的色情——这些就是好莱坞电影的特点。例如在纽约，在最近几个月里所上映的影片之中，不下百分之八十是在歌颂着卖淫和劫掠。美国人观看这种下流东西的数目在减少着。好莱坞影片的卖座在一年年地低落。
    在很有问题的美国统计里，也列举着空前的犯罪行为。在美国每十七秒钟就要发生一件大的犯罪案。在这方面好莱坞的制片商有着不少的功劳，因为他们的影片使观众腐化，引诱他们去犯罪。
    美国影片的腐败题材更大大地降低了原来已经很可怜的好莱坞的“艺术”水平。好莱坞影片的生产也像步枪和“飞行堡垒”的生产一样，无可避免地要引起可怜的手工业化、刻板和千篇一律。文艺之神不可能居住在生意人的舍园和警察的皮鞭所统治着的地方，在那里，艺术变成为买卖，变成为流通的赚钱的商品。
    电影是一件精巧的思想武器。好莱坞今天在武装着华尔街，正像“飞行堡垒”、反美活动调查委员会、军事基地以及杜鲁门先生本人一样。你们仔细地瞧瞧银幕，在好莱坞明星的甜笑之下，你们就可以看到华尔街的憎恨人类者的野兽式的牙齿。
