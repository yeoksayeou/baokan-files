Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, December 26th: A front-line reporter for this agency reports from Korea: The American invaders are capturing Korean youths in a vain attempt to solve their problem of a shortage of troops. The American invaders are incorporating the Korean youths they forcibly seize into the U.S. military in a mixed and vicious manner, so that under the direct supervision and coercion of the U.S. military, they can be used as tools for invading and slaughtering the Korean people.

In the U.S. invading army's 7th and 3rd Divisions, there are a large number of Korean soldiers. The reporter saw Park Chang-gae and An Young-soo, Korean soldiers of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division, who were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers. After being captured in Korea, they were sent to Japan, received only two weeks of "training," fired only fourteen bullets each, and were incorporated into the U.S. military, immediately sent to the Korean front line as cannon fodder.

Song Jing-yeol from Busan and Song Won-sik from Changwon County, Gyeongsangnam-do, belong to F Company, 7th Regiment, 3rd Division of the U.S. military. Song Jing-yeol was captured in Busan. Song Won-sik is a first-year student in the Commerce Department of Masan High School. He is only eighteen years old this year. He was captured during the school vacation in August and was imprisoned in Busan for more than twenty days. On September 23, they were loaded onto an American ship and sent to Japan for training, where they learned some English numbers, simple conversations, and infantry style, conducted three shooting practices, and were rushed to the Korean front.

The American invaders want them to be cannon fodder, but also treat them as slaves. According to these captured soldiers, the U.S. 7th and 3rd Divisions are mostly mixed formations, with half American and half Korean soldiers in each squad, but all squad and platoon leaders and officers at all levels are American. Americans have names, but Koreans are assigned numbers. The amount of food distributed is very different. American soldiers can take it freely, but Koreans are restricted and have to go hungry if they are not full. These soldiers are even followed and monitored by American soldiers when they go to the toilet.

These prisoners of war have suffered from the oppression of the American invading army and have personally witnessed the crimes of the American bandits, who have raped, looted, burned, and slaughtered in their own country. Therefore, most of them quickly woke up after being captured and accused the American invaders of their vicious means of forcing Koreans to kill each other. An Young-soo said: "I know that the American devils want to force the Korean people to kill each other and turn Korea into ashes. But we have suffered enough slavery and no one wants to be an American slave again." He firmly said: "I demand weapons and will fight back to my hometown with the People's Army to drive the American devils out of Korea."

    侵朝美军毒辣罪行
    强迫朝鲜青年作战屠杀自己同胞
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十六日电】本社朝鲜前线记者报道：美国侵略者抓捕朝鲜青年，妄图解决其兵源缺乏的困难。美国侵略者把他们强迫抓来的朝鲜青年，用混合编制的毒辣方法，编入美军的队伍中，以便在美军的直接监视和驱使下，作为侵略和屠杀朝鲜人民的工具。
    在美国侵略军第七师及第三师中，就有着大批朝鲜籍士兵。记者看到了被中国人民志愿军俘虏的美军第七师三十一团一营二连朝鲜籍士兵朴昌介、安英洙等人。他们在朝鲜被抓后，就被送到日本，仅仅受了两星期的“训练”，每个人打了十四发子弹，就被编入了美军的队伍，立即送到朝鲜前线当炮灰。
    釜山人宋敬烈和庆尚南道昌原县人宋元植属于美军第三师第七团Ｆ连。宋敬烈是在釜山被抓的。宋元植是马山高等学校商科一年级的学生，今年才十八岁，八月间学校放假时被抓，在釜山坐牢二十多天。九月二十三日，他们一同被装上一艘美国船送到日本受训，学了一些英文报数、简单会话和步兵式，进行了三次射击，就被赶到朝鲜前线。
    美国侵略者要他们当炮灰，同时又把他们视为奴隶。据这些被俘的士兵说，美军第七师、第三师大部是混合编制，每班美国人、朝鲜人各半，但所有班排长及各级军官则一律是美国人。美国人有名字，朝鲜人却被编成号码。食粮分配份量相差很大，美国兵可以随便拿，朝鲜人就被限制，吃不饱的只能挨饿。这些士兵甚至连大小便都被美国兵尾随监视。
    这些俘虏身受美国侵略军的压迫，并曾亲眼看到美国强盗在他们自己的国土上奸淫掳掠、焚烧屠杀的罪行，因此，他们在被俘后大多数都很快就觉悟过来，并纷纷控诉美国侵略者强迫朝鲜人自相残杀的毒辣手段。安英洙说：“我知道美国鬼子是要逼着朝鲜人民自相残杀，想把朝鲜变成灰烬。但是，我们已饱受奴隶痛苦，谁也不愿再做美国人的奴隶。”他坚决地说：“我要求发给武器，和人民军一道打回老家去，把美国鬼子赶出朝鲜。”
