Reaction to People's Daily Criticism

    Shandong Electric Factory Has Not Actually Improved Its Work in the Two Months Since Accepting Criticism from This Newspaper
    On September 21st, the People's Daily published an article entitled "Why Can't the Rationalization Proposals of the Publicly Owned Shandong Electric Factory Be Implemented?" Although the factory leadership promptly made a self-criticism, more than two months have passed, and the work has not yet improved. After the criticism was published, on the 23rd, the factory convened an enlarged meeting of the factory management committee standing committee to review the criticism from the People's Daily and made resolutions on improving working methods in the future (published in this newspaper on October 8th); but in fact, the factory leaders' attitude towards accepting criticism is extremely dishonest. For example, Comrade Li Wenjing of the Zibo Federation of Trade Unions working group also published an article criticizing the factory in "Zibo Communications." The factory leadership one-sidedly emphasized that certain trivial issues did not conform to the facts and refused to accept them, believing that this criticism would damage the factory's production reputation.
    For more than two months, the factory's work has not improved, specifically manifested in:
    I. Delaying Rectification and Study: The general branch arranged for rectification and study in August, but the administration used the excuse of "being busy" and "not being able to spare the time" (the general branch also accommodated them), and individual comrades even attempted to "get through this hurdle." Therefore, it has not been implemented to this day. Recently, a meeting of party and government cadres was convened without any preparation to study rectification and inspection work. As a result, the leadership proposed to work on "plans and reports" before the New Year and suggested carrying out rectification next year.
    II. Democratic Management at a Standstill: The factory's democratic management is basically at a standstill. Since accepting criticism from the People's Daily in September and making a public self-criticism, no management committee or workers' representative conference has been held in more than two months. In this situation, workers simply do not offer opinions, and even if individual comrades do, they are neither explained nor answered.
    III. Serious Waste and Rework: In September, in order to rush to meet targets, a batch of railway screws from the Jinan Railway Bureau was contracted out to workers, resulting in serious waste of tools and raw materials. At the same time, inaccurate estimation of work led to the loss of state property. For example, in making electric locks for the switch room, because the estimated work was too low, the actual wages earned by workers increased by an average of 100% compared to the past. Recently, the factory made anti-climbing devices for the Jinan Railway Bureau. The first batch of 8,000 pieces was delivered to Jinan, but after inspection, all of them were substandard and had to be reworked. Furthermore, the delivery of transformers for Tianjin was delayed, resulting in a fine of more than 50 million yuan. A purchasing agent bought 1 billion yuan worth of steel wire that could not be used. The factory director not only did not deal with it but instead adopted a conciliatory attitude, arousing great dissatisfaction among the majority of employees.

### 山东电器厂接受本报批评后两月来工作上实际并未改进

    山东电器厂接受本报批评后两月来工作上实际并未改进
    九月二十一日人民日报曾刊登了“公营山东电器厂合理化建议为什么搞不起来”一稿，该厂领导上虽及时作了检讨，但迄今已两月有余，工作犹未改进。当批评稿发表后，该厂于二十三日即召开了工厂管理委员会常委扩大会，根据人民日报的批评进行了检讨，并对今后改进工作方法作了决议（发表于本报十月八日）；但实际上该厂领导人对接受批评态度是极不老实的。例如当时淄博总工会工作组李文景同志，亦曾在“淄博通讯”上发表了一篇批评该厂的文章，该厂领导上即片面强调某些枝节问题与事实不符不予接受，并认为这种批评有损于本厂生产信誉。
    两个多月来，该厂工作仍未改进，具体表现在：
    一、拖延整风学习：八月份总支即布置了整风学习，但行政上却借口“工作忙”、“顾不得”（总支亦迁就他们），个别同志甚至企图“拖过这一关”，故至今仍未贯彻。最近在毫无准备的情况下召开了党政干部会议，研究整风检查工作，结果领导上又提出年前要搞“计划表报”，建议明年再进行整风。
    二、民主管理陷于停顿：该厂的民主管理，目前基本上陷于停顿状态。自九月份接受人民日报批评并公开作检讨后，到现在二个多月，未开过一次管委会和工代会议，工人在这种情况下，根本就不提意见，纵有个别同志提意见也是既不解释又不答复。
    三、反工浪费严重：九月份为了赶任务，将济南路局的一批铁路螺丝，包给工人干，结果造成工具、原料的严重浪费；同时由于估工不准确，并造成国家财产的损失。如开关间做电锁器，因估工过低，结果工人实得工资平均比过去增加一倍。最近该厂给济南路局做防爬器，第一批交货八千只，运到济南经检查后，全部不合规格而反工；又如给天津制造变压器，因延误运期被罚款五千余万元。采购员购买价值十亿元的钢线不能运用，厂长不但不予处理，反采取迁就原谅态度，引起广大职工极大不满。
