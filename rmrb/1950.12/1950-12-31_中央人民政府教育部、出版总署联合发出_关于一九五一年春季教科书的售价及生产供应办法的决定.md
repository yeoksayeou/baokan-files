Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications jointly issued a decision on the prices and supply methods of spring textbooks for 1951 on the 25th to the Education Departments (Cultural and Education Departments) of major administrative regions, the Education Bureaus of the five provinces and two cities in North China, the Cultural and Education Departments/Bureaus of all provinces and cities, and the news and publishing administrative organs. The full text is as follows:

(1) Textbooks for primary and secondary schools published by the People's Education Publishing House shall be supplied by Xinhua Bookstores in all regions. When necessary, other businesses may be organized to supply them jointly, based on actual needs.

(2) Educational administrative organs and news and publishing administrative organs at all levels in major administrative regions should lead The Commercial Press, the Zhonghua Book Company, and the Kaiming Bookstore, three publishers who have published textbooks before, to negotiate the supply of textbooks for middle school subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each major administrative region should adopt one type per subject in principle. The publishers of the selected textbooks should cooperate with the local Xinhua Bookstores to ensure timely supply according to the determined quantities.

(3) Local educational administrative organs should assist the textbook supply organizations established by local Xinhua Bookstores in conducting detailed surveys of the types and exact quantities of textbooks needed for primary and secondary schools this season, so as to grasp the inventory and sales volumes. The losses from unsold books in each region this season are limited to 5% of the total sales volume, and the tendency of undersupply should be prevented.

(4) Textbook prices should be uniformly quoted in Renminbi (prices in Northeast China should be quoted in Northeast Currency). All textbooks sold to students and schools in all regions should be calculated based on the currency price marked on the book and should not be sold at a markup or higher price for any reason.

(5) Textbook prices should be unified nationwide, in accordance with the regulations of the autumn of 1950. Primary school textbooks using 36-open format, each page (two sides) of domestic newspaper (domestic paper refers to machine-made paper produced domestically; if handmade paper is used and its price is lower than domestic paper, the price should be reduced proportionally) should be priced at 24 yuan Renminbi, and imported newspaper should be priced at 31.2 yuan Renminbi. The two pages of the cover should be counted as three pages. Middle school textbooks using 32-open format, each page of domestic newspaper should be priced at 28 yuan Renminbi, and imported newspaper should be priced at 36.6 yuan Renminbi. The two pages of the cover should be counted as five pages.

(6) The prices of textbooks published by private bookstores should be determined by the publishers themselves based on the actual cost plus reasonable profit, and should also be quoted in currency. The pricing should be reported to the General Administration of Publications for record.

(7) All manufacturing regions entrusted by the People's Education Publishing House or with its consent should report the manufacturing plan to the People's Education Publishing House before January 15th. If the manufacturing cost exceeds the standard stipulated in the autumn of 1950, the actual situation and materials must be reported to the People's Education Publishing House by the end of April, and the excess part will be subsidized after careful review by the People's Education Publishing House.

(8) The postal transportation and packaging costs of this period's textbooks (up to the county branch) may be established as a separate accounting item. The total branches of Xinhua Bookstore in each region shall make summary calculations before June 15th. If it exceeds or is less than 5% of the book price marked on the book, the People's Education Publishing House shall carefully review and subsidize or recover it.

(9) Xinhua Bookstores wholesale primary and secondary school textbooks to various bookstores and vendors; due to heavy postal transportation, taxes, and losses, all shall be charged at 85% of the actual price. In addition, schools, institutions, and their affiliated cooperatives or individuals who purchase books should not enjoy any discounts because the book prices have already been reduced, or may even need to be subsidized by the government.

(10) In order to suppress book prices and protect the domestic paper industry, textbooks should use domestic paper as much as possible, especially in paper-producing areas, machine-made paper or high-quality handmade paper produced locally must be used for manufacturing.

(11) The People's Education Publishing House is responsible for the production and manufacturing work in North China and East China in the spring of 1951, and uniformly provides paper patterns, which are supplied by the general branches of Xinhua Bookstore in other regions for regional manufacturing and supply. The production and sales situation, quantity, and samples should be reported to the People's Education Publishing House at any time. The People's Education Publishing House should master this information for research and calculation, and gradually achieve unified national textbook pricing, improved quality, and consistent production and sales. Xinhua Bookstores in all regions should gradually achieve timely, complete, and universal supply of national textbooks.

(12) After this decision and the list of primary and secondary school textbooks for the spring of 1951 are announced (the list has been sent to the Education Departments of major administrative regions and the Cultural and Education Departments/Bureaus of all provinces and cities), each region should announce the prices of each book in the local daily newspaper and print them into a catalog for distribution. Opinions from primary and secondary school teachers and students should be frequently solicited regarding the pricing, printing, binding, and supply of textbooks in order to improve the work.

    中央人民政府教育部、出版总署联合发出
    关于一九五一年春季教科书的售价及生产供应办法的决定
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府教育部和出版总署于二十五日向各大行政区教育部（文教部）华北五省二市教育厅局及各省市文教厅文教局及新闻出版行政机关联合发出关于一九五一年春季教科书的售价及供应办法的决定。全文如下：
    （一）人民教育出版社出版之中小学校教科书，全部由各地新华书店负责供应，必要时得视实际需要组织同业共同供应。
    （二）各大行政区各级教育行政机关及新闻出版行政机关应领导商务印书馆、中华书局、开明书店三家组织曾经出版教科书之出版家协商供应中学数理化生物等教科书。各大行政区以每科采用一种为原则。决定采用之教科书，其出版家应按确定数量配合各该地区新华书店负责及时供应。
    （三）各地教育行政机关应协助各地新华书店所组织的教科书供应机构，详细调查本季中小学用书种类及需要确数，以便掌握存销数量。本季各地存书损失，限定为总销数的百分之五，并应防止供不应求的偏向。
    （四）教科书一律用人民币定价（东北用东北币定价）。各地售与学生及学校的课本，一律按照书面标明的货币价格计算，不得根据任何理由，加成或加价出售。
    （五）教科书售价全国划一，仍依一九五○年秋季之规定，小学课本用三十六开本，每页（二面）国产报纸（国产纸即国内生产的机器纸，如用手工纸，其价格低于国产纸者，应按比例减低定价）为人民币二十四元，进口报纸为人民币三十一元二角，封面二页作为三页计。中学课本用三十二开本，每页国产报纸为人民币二十八元，进口报纸为人民币三十六元六角，封面二页作为五页计。
    （六）私营书店出版之教科书，其售价应依据实际成本加上合理利润，由出版者自行规定，亦一律以货币定价。定价应报告出版总署备案。
    （七）受人民教育出版社委托或得其同意之各造货地区，应于一月十五日前将造货计划报告人民教育出版社。如造货成本超过一九五○年秋季规定之标准时，并须将实际情况及材料于四月底报告人民教育出版社，经人民教育出版社精密审核后，补贴其超过之部分。
    （八）本期教科书之邮运包扎用费（到县支店为止）得另立会计科目，规定六月十五日前由新华书店各地区总分店汇总结算，如超过或少于书面定价百分之五时，由人民教育出版社精密审核，补贴或收还之。
    （九）新华书店对各贩卖书店及摊贩批售中小学教科书；因负担邮运捐税耗损甚重，一律改为八五折实收。此外学校、机关及其附设之合作社或个人购书，因书价业已减低，或且须由政府补贴，不应享有任何折扣。
    （十）为抑低书价并保护本国造纸工业，教科用书应尽可能采用国产纸，尤其在产纸地区，必须用本地生产之机器纸或品质优良之手工纸造货。
    （十一）人民教育出版社担任一九五一年春季华北、华东地区之生产造货工作，并统一供给纸型，由其它地区新华书店总分店分区造货供应。其产销情况、数量、样本，应随时向人民教育出版社报告。人民教育出版社应掌握此项资料研究核算，逐步做到全国教科书定价划一、品质提高、产销相符。各地新华书店应逐步做到全国教科书供应及时、完备、普遍。
    （十二）本决定及一九五一年春季中小学用书表公布后（该表已径发各大行政区教育部、各省市文教厅局），各地区应将各书价格在当地日报公布，并印成书目分发。有关教科书之定价、印刷、装钉及供应情况，应经常征求中小学教师和同学的意见，以便改进工作。
