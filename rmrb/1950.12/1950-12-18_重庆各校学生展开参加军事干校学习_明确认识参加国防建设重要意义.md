Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 15th: Students in major universities and middle schools in Chongqing have widely launched studies on the issue of participating in military cadre schools. They have enthusiastically discussed issues such as "the individual and the motherland" and "revolution and family," and have enhanced their understanding of participating in national defense construction.

Sun Xingchao, a student in the Geology Department of Chongqing University, had hoped to become a geologist in the future. After this study, he has realized that if there is no strong national defense, our enemy, American imperialism, will turn our motherland into a colony. In that case, where would those of us who study geology contribute our knowledge? Therefore, they decided to participate in the sacred cause of national defense construction. Ma Huaichen, a student at the Southwest Industrial College, thought before the study that it was a pity to give up the two years of chemical engineering he had already studied. After the study, he realized that if there is no strong national defense, even if many factories are built, they will not be able to withstand enemy aggression, and everything will be reduced to ashes. Nie Hongmo, a Southwest Industrial College student who一心想做工程师 (single-mindedly wanted to be an engineer), resolutely signed up to participate in military school after he understood that it would be useless to study if the independence of the motherland was not guaranteed. Many students in various schools also had concerns about family issues, and they have made great progress after studying. For example, Chongqing University student Zeng Yuandao wrote to his parents, saying: "You love your son, please love the sons of millions of people even more. It is glorious for your son to go to the most needed post of the motherland." Wang Xiuling, a student at Nankai Middle School, said: "I love my father and mother, but American imperialism is slaughtering the Chinese and Korean people in Korea and Northeast China. How many parents have lost their sons, can we bear it?" Another student from the school stated: "Precisely because I love my father and mother, I am determined to participate in national defense construction to protect them." Xu Shaowei, a student at Southwest Industrial School, plans to write to his mother, asking her to learn from Commander Zhu De's mother. Students from Chongqing Municipal Middle School who have decided to participate in military school are also discussing how to win the consent of their families.

Many students' parents are very understanding and encourage their children to embark on glorious posts. Mr. Shen Kai, a teacher at Nankai Middle School, happily sponsored his son, Shen Yinong, to participate in military school, saying: "Parents should encourage children's patriotic actions and should not stop them. I am willing to contribute my son to the motherland." Chen Dailing's mother, a student at Tsinghua Middle School, not only happily encouraged her daughter to embark on a glorious post, but also prepared to participate in revolutionary work herself.

    明确认识参加国防建设重要意义
    【新华社重庆十五日电】重庆市各大、中学校的学生普遍展开关于参加军事干部学校问题的学习，他们热烈地讨论了“个人与祖国”、“革命与家庭”等问题，并提高了对于参加国防建设的认识。
    重庆大学地质系学生孙星焯曾希望自己将来作一个地质学专家。经过这次学习，他已认识到：如果没有强大的国防，我们的敌人美国帝国主义就会把我们的祖国变为殖民地，这样，我们学地质学的将到那块土地上去贡献出我们的学识呢？因此，他们决定参加国防建设的神圣事业。西南工业专科学校学生马怀琛在学习前认为他自己已经学了二年化学工程，丢了可惜。经过学习后，他认识到假若没有坚强的国防，虽然建筑了许多工厂，也会挡不住敌人的侵略，一切都将会化为泡影。一心想做工程师的西南工业专科学校学生聂鸿模，当他明白了如果祖国的独立没有保障，学成了也没用处的道理之后，他就毅然地报名参加军事学校。各校学生中有不少人还有对于家庭问题的顾虑，经过学习以后也有了很大的进步。例如重庆大学学生曾远道给他父母写信说：“你们爱自己的儿子，请你们更爱千百万人民的儿子。你们的儿子走上了祖国最需要的岗位，这是光荣的。”南开中学学生王秀玲说：“我爱我的爸爸和妈妈，但是美帝国主义在朝鲜和我东北屠杀中朝人民，多少父母失去了他们的儿子，我们能忍心吗？”该校另一学生表示：正因为我爱爸爸和妈妈，所以我决心参加国防建设来保卫他们。西南工业学校学生徐绍渭准备写信给他母亲，要他向朱德司令的母亲学习。重庆市立中学已决心参加军事学校的学生并漫谈如何争取家庭同意。
    很多学生的父母深明大义，鼓励他们的儿女踏上光荣岗位。南开中学教师申锴先生很愉快地赞助他的儿子申艺农参加军事学校学习，他说：“孩子们的爱国行动，做父母的应该鼓励，不应阻挡。我愿向祖国贡献出我的儿子。”清华中学学生陈岱岭的母亲不但高高兴兴地鼓励她的女儿走上光荣岗位，而且自己也准备参加革命工作。
