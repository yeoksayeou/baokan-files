U.S. Imperialism's Devastation of Beijing's Industry and Commerce

Wang Dabang, manager of Beijing Dacheng Pharmaceutical Factory, used "acute infectious bubonic plague" to describe the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism against national industry and commerce after the surrender of the Japanese invaders. This is very appropriate. From 1945 to before the liberation of Beijing in 1949, under the ravages of this "infectious disease," most factories in Beijing suffered from sluggish sales, production shutdowns, factory closures, and bankruptcies. The emerging pharmaceutical industry was forced to completely halt manufacturing; half of the knitting factories closed; the dairy industry painfully slaughtered and sold half of the city's dairy cows; and the cigarette, rubber, and glass instrument industries were on the verge of collapse.

Before this, Beijing's new pharmaceutical manufacturing industry had already begun to take shape, capable of manufacturing some ephedrine, ferric ammonium citrate, calcium lactate, sulfathiazole, and other chemical preparations. Who knew that after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, U.S. imperialism seized the customs, colluded with the Kuomintang's Kong and Song families' Yangzi Company and other trading institutions, plundered foreign exchange, and shipped in large quantities of American medicines. At the same time, U.S. imperialism used the hypocritical guise of the "Relief Administration" to promote American medicines in large quantities. The U.S. military smuggled "surplus materials," and American medicines flooded the market in large quantities, selling at very low prices, forcing Beijing factories to have no sales at all. Various medicines that had already been invented and manufactured were also unable to compete with American goods due to high costs, and all manufacturing was halted. Wang Minsheng, manager of Zhonghua Pharmacy, said: Our country actually needs only 150 to 200 kinds of medicines, but U.S. imperialism brought in 20,000 kinds, with medicines for treating venereal diseases being the most numerous, even distilled water was shipped in, showing how vicious and hateful the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism was.

American-made glass stockings, glass belts, glass raincoats, etc., also flooded the Beijing market like a tide. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionary government dared not levy tariffs and business taxes, and a large number of goods were smuggled in by the U.S. military. Thus, domestically produced silk stockings, linen stockings, and cotton stockings suffered severely. Within two months of U.S. imperialism's arrival in Beijing, half of Beijing's original sixty-odd knitting factories had closed down. Dehua Hosiery Factory, the largest silk stocking factory in Beijing, had to close down, and its twenty or thirty knitting machines were scattered in disarray. Shirts and vests were also suffocated by U.S. imperialism. Ji Zengshou, chairman of the Knitting Industry Association, said: "At that time, glass stockings were like a scourge. Many of us shopkeepers had to run around selling goods ourselves. At that time, we had no way out!"

China's national cigarette industry eked out a living under the rule and monopoly of British and American imperialism. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, American-made cigarettes such as "Hongguang," "Jishi," "Camel," and "Malis" monopolized the Chinese cigarette market, and Beijing cigarette factories closed down one after another.

Beijing originally had 1,500 dairy cows, but since the arrival of "American milk powder" in 1945, only 800 remained. According to Li Yizan, manager of Fukang Milk Factory: At that time, the dairy industry was under three serious threats: First, American milk powder flooded the market, and its price was lower than that of cow and goat milk; second, the price of dairy cows was the same as that of beef cattle; third, feed prices were high, and milk prices were unreasonable. Many dairy farms had to slaughter cattle and sell meat, suspend operations, or change industries.

Speaking of the rubber industry at that time, it was also very tragic. At that time, American-made automobile tires of all sizes, steam pipes and air brake pipes used in railways, rubber sheets used in machinery factories, and transparent rubber tubes used in medical equipment were all shipped in large quantities. Many of Beijing's emerging rubber industries were devastated and shut down.

After 1945, the glass instrument industry's business declined sharply. By 1948, not a single finished product had been sold, and all instrument supplies on the market were "American-made." The manufacturing plants had to make kerosene lamp shades to make a living. Other industries such as mechanized flour milling, weaving and dyeing, and oil pressing also directly or indirectly suffered from the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism.

However, let's look at the situation of various industries today after liberation, which is a stark contrast to the tragic situation of being invaded by U.S. imperialism under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past. After liberation, thanks to the strong guidance and support of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, especially after the adjustment of industry and commerce in May this year, the business of various industries has been improving day by day, factory machines are running non-stop, and large and small stores are bustling with customers. The new pharmaceutical manufacturing industry now has a total of nineteen households. In the past, not a single product was produced, but currently, the monthly output of new pharmaceutical raw materials is 50,000 pounds, the monthly output of injections is 975,000, and the monthly output of tablets is 10 million. The finished products sell well in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. The Beijing business community, in order to defend the good times now, firmly stated that they will make every effort to abide by the five patriotic covenants they made at the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland rally held on November 7, to ensure the consolidation of the economic front and strike at the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

### 美帝对北京工商业的摧残

    美帝对北京工商业的摧残
    北京大成药厂经理王大邦用“急性传染脖来比喻日寇投降后美帝对民族工商业的经济侵略。这是很恰当的。一九四五年到一九四九年北京解放前，在这种“传染病”的摧残下，北京大部分厂家销路呆滞、生产停顿、关厂歇业和破产。新兴的制药业，被迫全部停止制造；针织业有一半关了厂；牛羊乳业忍痛将全市乳牛宰卖了一半；卷烟、橡胶、玻璃仪器等业陷于奄奄一息。
    在这以前，北京的新药制造业，本已初具规模，能够制造一些麻黄素、柠檬酸铁錏、乳酸钙、磺?噻唑等化学制剂，谁知日寇投降以后，美帝强占了海关，勾结国民党孔宋两大家族的扬子公司等贸易机构，掠夺了外汇，大量运进美国药品，同时美帝并利用“救济总署”的伪善面目，大量推销美药，美军以“剩余物资”走私，美国药品充斥市场，大量倾销，价格很低，迫使北京各厂产品全无销路，已发明制造的各种药品，也因成本高，无法与美货竞争，而全部停止制造。中华大药房经理王敏生说：我国实际需要的药品，只要一百五十种至二百种，可是美帝运来的就有二万种，其中以治花柳病等的药最多，连蒸溜水都运来，可见美帝经济侵略是如何毒辣可恶。
    美制的玻璃丝袜、玻璃皮带、玻璃雨衣等，也像潮水一样地涌向北京市场，加上国民党反动政府不敢要关税和营业税，由美军私运进口的也极多。这样，国产丝袜、麻纱袜、线袜等便受到了严重的打击，美帝到北京不及两个月，北京原有的六十余家针织工厂，就倒闭了一半，北京规模最大的一家丝袜厂德华织袜厂，只得关厂，二、三十台织袜机也便七零八落地分散了，衬衫、背心也都被美帝顶得喘不过气来。针织业同业公会理事长冀增寿说：“那时，玻璃丝袜就像祸水，我们这样好多掌柜只得都去跑单帮，那时，我们一点辙没有！”
    中国的民族卷烟工业，是在美英帝国主义的统治垄断下苟生的。日寇投降后，“红光”、“吉士”、“骆驼”、“马立斯”等美制纸烟，就霸占了中国的卷烟市场，北京各烟厂纷纷倒闭。
    北京原有乳牛一千五百头，自从一九四五年“美国奶粉”来后不久，就只剩下八百头了。据福康牛奶厂经理李贻赞谈：那时，牛羊乳业受到三个严重威胁：第一，美国奶粉充斥市场，价格比牛羊乳贱；第二，乳牛价与肉牛价相同；第三，饲料价昂，乳价不合理，许多牛羊乳业，只好都宰牛卖肉，停业或改业了。
    说到那时的橡胶业也是很悲惨的，那时候美制大大小小的汽车轮胎，铁路上用的暖汽管、风闸管，机械厂用的胶板，医疗器材用的透明橡胶管，都大量地运来，北京新兴的橡胶工业，被摧残而停业的很多。
    玻璃仪器业在一九四五年后，业务就每况愈下了，到一九四八年，一件成品也没有卖出去，市面上仪器用品全是“美国造”，制造厂就只得做洋灯罩来糊口。其他如机制面粉业、织染业、榨油业等，都直接或间接地遭受到美帝经济侵略的打击。
    但是，现在来看一下解放后今天各业的情况，与过去国民党反动政府统治下受美帝侵略的惨状，正好是一个鲜明的对比。解放以后，由于北京市人民政府大力指导和扶植，尤其是在今年五月调整工商业以后，各业业务日益好转，工厂机器转动不停，大小商店，门庭若市，新药制造工业现共有十九户，过去产品一个不出，目前新药原料月产五万磅，注射剂月产九十七万五千针，片剂月产一千万片，制成品畅销华北、东北、西北各地。卷烟业九月生产量增加到五百六十箱，比一九四八年月产量三十箱增加了近二十倍。北京工商界为了保卫现在的好光景，坚决表示要尽一切努力遵守他们在十一月七日举行的抗美援朝保家卫国大会上订出的五项爱国公约，保证巩固经济战线，打击美帝侵略者。
