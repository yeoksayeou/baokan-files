Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th: TASS, New York, 27th: Over five thousand young workers and students held a grand mass rally in New York to salute the delegates attending the first annual meeting of the Labor Youth League.

Those who spoke at the meeting included the famous writer Howard Fast, Communist Party National Committee member Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Labor Youth League Chairman Wofsey, National Committee representative of the Puerto Rican Youth National League Albona, and the famous Black singer Paul Robeson.

In his speech, Fast emphasized that the primary task of American youth is to rescue their country from a group of "evil people who rule America and are preparing to plunge mankind into a sea of blood." "It is not enough to know that the soul of a small grocer (referring to U.S. President Truman who once worked as a small grocer) can never conquer human hope." It is essential to understand that true patriotism lies in bravely refusing to help new war instigators and prevent America from becoming the most hated word of all time.

Flynn brought fraternal greetings from the Communist Party. She said, "We, the older generation who have suffered, know that you will see the victory of socialism in our country," and see socialism victorious not only in the New Democratic countries, but also "in other parts of the world where its people are resolutely advancing towards this goal."

The meeting warmly welcomed the congratulatory message from the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee. When the conclusion of the message, "Long live the friendship between Soviet and American youth," was read, the applause turned into thunderous cheers. The meeting also read congratulatory messages from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Youth Federation, and progressive youth organizations from Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries.

Labor Youth League Chairman Wofsey said in his speech that the League has set the task of striving for American youth to fight for peace and has made some progress in this regard. The League has braved all kinds of persecution to collect half a million youth signatures for peace declarations. American progressive youth reject Wall Street's plans. "Our annual meeting has decided that the main task lies in finding ways to unite the millions of young people who want peace."

The audience warmly welcomed the speech by Albona, chairman of the Puerto Rican Youth National League. He said that the recent events that shook all of Puerto Rico (referring to the uprising of the Puerto Rican people against American imperialism colonial rule at the end of last month) are a vivid manifestation of the growing anti-imperialist sentiment. This anti-imperialist sentiment has prompted the Puerto Rican people to take action against colonialism and seek national independence.

The last speaker, Robeson, was welcomed with lasting applause. He said, "We are not the America of Dulles, MacArthur, and other evil forces. We are the America of the defenders of the beautiful dreams of freedom and equality of the people... Many evil people in America want you to be silent. They want to drive you to slaughter the youth of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. They want you to remain silent when the likes of Eisenhower and Stassen turn American universities into barracks... But you, the Labor Youth League, say to them: We don't want your plans. You say, we want books, not bullets, we want bread, not cannons, we want peace, we want friendship with the Soviet Union, China, Europe, Africa - you say we want life, not death."

Robeson reminded the youth that thirty-three years ago, predatory capitalists attempted to strangle the socialist country, but failed. He predicted that their conspiracies to undermine the people's democratic countries and their hopes to stop the advance of 475 million patriotic Chinese people will also meet with the same failure. The patriotic Chinese people have forever refused to live a life of being bullied and making profits for foreign imperialists, and they want to turn their country and the entire Far East into a land of freedom, dignity, and security.

Finally, Robeson and the choir sang together the World Federation of Democratic Youth's "World Democratic Youth March."

    纽约青年举行盛大集会
    向出席劳动青联第一届年会代表致敬
    法斯特号召从战争贩子手中拯救祖国
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：五千余名青年工人与学生在纽约举行盛大的群众集会，向出席劳动青年联盟第一届年会的代表们致敬。
    在会上发言的有著名作家法斯特、共产党全国委员会委员佛林、劳动青年联盟主席伏夫西、波多黎各青年全国联盟全国委员会代表阿尔波那与著名黑人歌唱家罗伯逊等。
    法斯特在演说中强调指出：美国青年的首要任务在于从一批“统治着美国并准备将人类浸入血海中的恶人”手中，把自己的国家拯救出来。“只是知道小杂货商（按美国总统杜鲁门曾做过小杂货商）的灵魂永远不能征服人类的希望，是不够的”。必须了解真正的爱国主义是要勇敢地拒绝帮助新战争煽动者，使美利坚成为一切时代的最受憎恨的字眼。
    佛林带来了共产党的兄弟般的贺意。她说：“我们这些苦难的老一代的人，知道你们将看见社会主义在我们国家胜利”，看见社会主义不仅仅在新民主主义国家胜利，而且也“在其人民朝着这一目标坚决前进的世界其他地方胜利”。
    会议热烈欢迎苏联青年反法西斯委员会的贺电。当读到贺电的结语“美苏青年友谊万岁”时，喝采变成了雷鸣似的欢呼。会议也宣读了世界民主青年联盟，中华全国民主青年联合总会，英、法、意、日等各国家的进步青年组织的贺电。
    劳动青年联盟主席伏夫西在演说中说：联盟已经定下了争取美国青年为和平而斗争的任务，并且已在这一方面有所进展。联盟已冒着种种迫害而为和平宣言征集五十万青年的签名。美国进步青年拒绝华尔街的计划。“我们的年会已经决定：主要任务在于寻找方法把要和平的数百万青年团结起来。”
    听众热烈欢迎波多黎各青年全国联盟主席阿尔波那的演说。他说：最近震撼全波多黎各的事件（按指上月底波多黎各人民反对美帝国主义殖民统治的起义），乃是日益增长的反帝国主义情绪的生动表现。这种反帝国主义情绪，促使波多黎各人民为了反对殖民主义、谋取民族独立而行动起来。
    最后一位演说者罗伯逊受到经久不息的掌声的欢迎。他说：“我们不是杜勒斯、麦克阿瑟及其他罪恶势力的美国。我们是人民的自由与平等之美梦的保卫者的美国……美国的许多恶人要你们沉默。他们要驱使你们去屠杀朝鲜、中国和苏联的青年。他们要你们在艾森豪威尔与史塔生之流把美国的大学变成兵营的时候，沉默不言。……但是你们劳动青年联盟向他们说：不要你们的计划。你们说，要书籍，不要子弹，要面包，不要大炮，要和平，要对苏联、中国、欧洲、非洲的友谊——你们说要生命，不要死亡。”
    罗伯逊提醒青年们说：三十三年前掠夺成性的资本家们企图绞杀社会主义的国度，但失败了。他预言，他们阴谋破坏人民民主国家、希望阻止四万七千五百万中国爱国人民的前进，也会遭到同样的失败。中国的爱国人民已经永远拒绝了受人欺侮而为外国帝国主义者制造利润的生活，而要把他们的国家与整个远东变成自由、尊严与安全的国土。
    最后，罗伯逊和合唱队一齐歌唱世界民主青年联盟的“世界民主青年进行曲”。
