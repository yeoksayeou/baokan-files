Since the Chinese people, on a voluntary basis, went to Korea to resist the aggression of American imperialism, the actions of national industrialists and businessmen in this movement have been commendable. After the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce initiated the patriotic pact, major cities enthusiastically launched this movement one after another. Recently, industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, Beijing, Harbin, Qingdao, Xi'an, Wuhan, and other places have successively held demonstrations and parades involving tens of thousands of people. On December 16th, the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles held a large demonstration parade of 150,000 people, demonstrating unprecedented unity among national industrialists and businessmen and their firm determination to resist America and aid Korea. The study of current events has also unfolded unprecedentedly in industrial and commercial circles. All of this shows that Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have not only a clear understanding of this Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement but also a firm stance. In other words, national industrialists and businessmen understand the essence of imperialist aggression and have not forgotten the bloody facts of American imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out various political and economic aggressions against us over the years. Of course, they remember more vividly the dumping of American goods in 1946, the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, and the bombing of Shanghai on February 6th this year. Therefore, they have clarified the boundaries between friend and foe and firmly stood with the masses of the people to resist our common enemy—American imperialism—to help our neighbors and defend our country. It should be acknowledged that it is not easy for national industrialists and businessmen to have such performance and progress. Because they all have businesses and property, and they all hope to develop day by day in an environment of peaceful construction. Therefore, in their eyes, war is a terrible thing. However, the ambition of American imperialism, this behavior of copying Japan's old tricks, has the ultimate goal of enslaving China and conquering the world. Under such insane and vicious imperialist pressure, we cannot have an environment of peaceful construction. If there is, it is just another name for humiliation and苟安 (gou an: seeking temporary ease and comfort). Under humiliation and苟安 (gou an), the entire nation, including industry and commerce, has no freedom and no future. Today, the interests of national industry and commerce cannot be separated from the interests of the Chinese people. Only the victory of the Chinese people can guarantee the prosperity and development of industry and commerce, as the situation after this year's adjustment of industry and commerce can prove. National industrialists and businessmen understand this point. The history of being invaded and oppressed in the past, as well as the people's government's support and maintenance of industry and commerce over the past year or so, have all proved this point. Therefore, in this Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, Chinese national industrialists and businessmen, at least most of them, understand the need to combine their individual interests with the interests of the entire nation, so they have such positive performance. This action, which signifies progress and unity, should be regarded as a very important aspect of the strength of Resist-America, Aid-Korea.

Resist-America, Aid-Korea will be a long-term struggle. Although the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army recently dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism and achieved a decisive victory on the Korean battlefield, this does not mean that the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work has come to an end. Because imperialism is unwilling to accept its failure and unwilling to be destined to accelerate its demise, it will carry out a dying, frantic struggle. Therefore, a longer and more arduous struggle lies ahead. The work that Chinese national industrialists and businessmen should undertake throughout the struggle, and which the Chinese people expect of them, will become increasingly important. I would like to point out the most important of these:

First, Chinese national industrialists and businessmen should not only strive to do a good job in their businesses, such as increasing production, expanding circulation, reducing costs, and ensuring quality, but also further move closer to the government, accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, and combine public and private forces to ensure the rational allocation of raw materials, the rational distribution and sale of products, and the rational supply of the market. This means that private enterprises can be organized into the overall national economic plan, so that production and consumption can be properly balanced. This can not only reduce waste but also make the nation's strength used most economically and exert maximum effectiveness. After May this year, the government, in implementing the work of adjusting industry and commerce, also organized private enterprises into the overall plan as much as possible, thus achieving great results. However, this work is not done enough, especially on the part of private enterprises, who are still unwilling to frankly and sincerely tell all their equipment, production capacity, use of funds, raw material reserves, product sales, and other situations. Some are worried about the public sector, and some have even more problems among themselves. They often only "get closer" a little when they are in trouble, and when the situation improves, they want to get rid of the past "constraints" as much as possible, hoping for greater "freedom." Such a situation will be extremely insufficient and fragile for the demands of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement in the future. The requirement in the future is that the forces of the public and private sectors must be combined, private enterprises must obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the state-owned economy must guarantee the normal development of private enterprises. It should be recognized that individuals who are separated from the whole, and small interests that violate large interests, will inevitably fall into destruction. Only by subordinating individuals to the whole, and small interests to large interests, can we achieve victory.

Second, with the unfolding of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work, we believe that we will certainly give the aggressors a heavy blow that is enough to make them sober, and we have already done so. However, imperialism will not be sober, especially American imperialism. Its madness and behavior of expanding aggression will force us to invest a great deal of power in all facilities related to national defense. In this case, the stability of the economic market will be another goal of the economic front, and this work is closely related to the victory at the front. We must admit that the economic market is extremely prone to turmoil in wartime. However, for the sake of victory, we must stabilize the economic market. There are many factors that disrupt the economic market in wartime, such as lack of supplies, transportation difficulties, war damage, and rumors. Today, the People's Government is confident that it can overcome all of this appropriately. We dare not say that there will be no situations where, in a certain place, in a certain short period of time, a certain item may experience more or less fluctuations in the market due to a temporary shortage of supply, but basically speaking, the government has sufficient confidence to stabilize the market. Specifically speaking, the two aspects most closely related to people's lives are nothing more than clothing and food. Due to this year's widespread good harvests across the country, with grain production at over 240 billion catties and cotton production at over 14.2 million dan, based on this year's grain consumption and the opening of cotton mills in the second half of the year, there will be sufficient guarantees for the supply of grain and cloth next year. In addition, the large-scale increase in tea, silkworms, hemp, eggs, meat, and other products, as well as the development of exchanges between urban and rural areas and the prosperity of industry and commerce after the adjustment of industry and commerce in the second half of the year, some of which increase foreign exchange income and some of which replenish market supplies, this good foundation greatly favors the stability of the market next year. There is also the most important point, we can believe in the government, that is, on top of all the factors that can affect the economic market, it will never add the most fatal factor, which is inflation. Because after the unification of finance and economics, we have basically ended the history of inflation over the past twelve years left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, the People's Government's finances are completely in accordance with Chairman Mao's three instructions for consolidation work and are built on the basis of revenue and expenditure being close to balanced. Without this fatal factor, we believe that even if the situation becomes a little more tense in the future, local and minor fluctuations in the economic market may be unavoidable, but basically, there will never be the kind of major storms that happened in the past. This is naturally only talking about one aspect. There is also another aspect, which is the issue of the relationship between industrial and commercial circles and the market. From the perspective of a legitimate industrialist and businessman, that is, from the perspective of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen, market stability is beneficial to them. The painful experience of the past twelve years has fully illustrated this point. However, a very small number of degenerates who want to fish in troubled waters and engage in speculation cannot be said to have completely disappeared today. Therefore, on the other hand, stabilizing the market and stabilizing people's hearts will be one of the important tasks of national industrialists and businessmen. They should cooperate with the government's policies, set an example themselves, and use their own strength to stabilize the market. At the same time, they should monitor these small number of degenerates in their own industries, eliminate all rumors, and prevent all acts that disrupt the market from occurring. In order to stabilize the market and ensure reasonable supply, the government will implement some control measures for several daily necessities. Some have already been done. National industrialists and businessmen should not only accept these controls but also provide full assistance to the government in the process of implementation. Victory on the economic front will undoubtedly not only stabilize the hearts of the people in the rear but also greatly encourage the morale of the front.

Third, in order to strengthen national defense forces, it is undeniable that the government's financial expenditures will increase in the future. However, this will not have a significant impact on the balance of payments, because the government is determined to consolidate the work of balancing revenue and expenditure. One aspect of this consolidation work is that revenue cannot be reduced. Therefore, one thing must be solemnly raised to national industrialists and businessmen across the country, which is the issue of paying taxes. Since the National Taxation Conference in June this year, the government has made significant modifications to a portion of the taxes borne by industry and commerce. For example, the number of tax items has been reduced, tax procedures have been simplified, tax rates have been reduced, and even penalties for late payment have been greatly reduced. The government resolutely implemented all of this in order to take care of the difficulties of industry and commerce at the time, even though the finances were not generous. The reduction of tax rates and the improvement of the tax system have obviously played a role in the recovery of industry and commerce in the second half of the year. However, deviations have occurred in some places as a result, that is, some industrialists and businessmen believe that the government is deceptive and arbitrarily delay the payment of taxes that should be paid. The seriousness of this phenomenon, taking the example of Shanghai alone, has aroused serious discussion and severe criticism from the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee. This abandonment of one's due responsibility and the phenomenon of underestimating, delaying tax payment, and even evading taxes will seriously hinder the foundation of national finance. In addition to the government's strict sanctions in accordance with the law, national industrialists and businessmen should mobilize the power of organizations to educate and supervise these backward elements who harm the group and have no national or ethnic concepts. Because, in all fairness, the tax system revised by the June Taxation Conference can be said to be not at all harsh and extremely fair to the burden of industry and commerce, which is unanimously recognized by industrialists and businessmen. Today, in order to resist America and aid Korea, the government has increased expenditures and only supplemented the increased portion by cutting other expenses, and has not intended to increase tax rates to increase the burden of industry and commerce, which is already a natural and just thing. If industrialists and businessmen do not express their faith and support for the government and their determination to resist America and aid Korea through enthusiastic tax payment, what better way is there to prove all of this?

Fourth, Resist-America, Aid-Korea is a matter for the entire nation. Victory cannot be achieved without the strength of the entire nation. In the patriotic pacts of industrial and commercial circles in various places, we have all seen such a clause, which says: dedicate all our strength to support the front. This brilliant oath will forever be written in the history of the Chinese people's resistance to imperialism. There are many aspects to the work of supporting the front. In terms of contributing financial and material resources, national industrialists and businessmen are undoubtedly the most likely among today's four friends. This work not only demonstrates one's understanding and determination but also educates and encourages other industrialists and businessmen, and of course, it is a great encouragement to Korea. After we achieved such a great victory on the Korean front, a movement to express condolences has unfolded in various places. We believe that industrial and commercial circles will definitely have outstanding performances. Further, the work of supporting the front should not be mechanically interpreted as donating some funds and materials. Supporting the front can actually be regarded as an entire economic mobilization, because only in this way can we more effectively meet the demands of the front. We should imagine that in the future, the enemy will implement vicious economic blockades against us. In the future, the enemy may bomb our cities, destroy our industries, make us feel a lack of many materials, and make our semi-colonial economy, which has not yet been reorganized, particularly expose many flaws. At this time, national industrialists and businessmen should develop the spirit of dedicating all their strength to support the front, closely unite around the government, obey the government's command, and abandon the current interests of the small self in order to strive for the overall long-term survival and development. At that time, some individual businesses of national industrialists and businessmen may suffer destruction and sacrifice. However, the victory of the Chinese people will definitely make this sacrifice not only compensated in the future but also have greater development.

Fifth, today, industrial and commercial circles across the country are actively studying current affairs related to Resist-America, Aid-Korea. However, in terms of quantity, it is not widespread enough, and in terms of depth, it is not thorough enough. The most significant situation is that the ideological concerns of some larger industrialists and businessmen have not been completely resolved, and the degree of ideological hostility towards American imperialism among some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen is still not enough. Overall, there is still a lack of organized and led mobilization for the study of such a current affairs issue that is related to the survival of our country, and it is also not combined enough with one's own business. It should be known that American imperialism has exhausted its ability to deceive and disguise itself in its decades of aggression against China. During the more than twenty years of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule, it shamelessly promoted the grace of the American imperialist masters to the people on the one hand, and fabricated all kinds of bizarre rumors and slanders against the Soviet Union on the other hand. Twenty years is not a short time. Therefore, today, distinguishing between friend and foe, recognizing the aggressive nature of American imperialism, and the brotherly friendly relations within the world's peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union should not be regarded as an easy task. Under such circumstances, it is indeed a very necessary thing to widely, deeply, and long-termly carry out learning and make this trend permeate the entire industrial and commercial circles. It should be regarded as one of the tasks in the future.

Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have demonstrated many achievements in the anti-imperialist struggle in the past few decades. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the past year, national industrialists and businessmen have greatly improved. It is believed that this one of the four friends will definitely emit a point of heat and light in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement and will definitely complete its due tasks.

    民族工商业家在抗美援朝运动中的任务
    自从中国人民在志愿的基础上，赴朝抗击美帝的侵略，全国掀起抗美援朝保家卫国的运动以来，民族工商业者在这次运动中所表现的一切，是值得称道的。在北京工商联发起了爱国公约以后，各大城市都热烈地一个紧接着一个展开这个运动；最近天津、北京、哈尔滨、青岛、西安、武汉等地的工商界，都先后举行了数万人以上的示威大游行；本月十六日，上海工商界举行了十五万人的大示威游行，表现出民族工商业者空前团结，坚决抗美援朝。对于时事的学习，在工商界也空前的展开。这一切，说明了中国民族工商业者对于这次抗美援朝运动，不但有清楚的认识，而且有坚定的立场。换言之，民族工商业者是懂得帝国主义的侵略的本质，没有忘记这多少年来美帝国主义勾结蒋匪帮对我们施行政治的经济的各种侵略的血腥事实；当然其中更记得鲜明的是一九四六年的美货倾销，中美商约的签订，以及今年二月六日上海的大轰炸等，因而更明确了敌友的界限，坚定地与人民大众站在一起，抗击我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义，来帮助我们的邻居，来保卫我们的国家。应该承认，民族工商业者能有这样的表现与进步，是不容易的。因为他们都有事业，都有财产，他们都希望能在和平建设的环境中一天一天的发展，因而在他们看来，战争是可怕的一件事。但是，美帝国主义的野心，这种抄袭日本故技的行为，是以奴役中国，征服全世界为其最终的目标的。在这样疯狂狠毒的帝国主义压力之下，我们不可能有和平建设的环境，假如有，那是屈辱与苟安的别名；在屈辱与苟安下，整个民族，工商业也在内，是没有自由、没有前途的。今天民族工商业的利益，与中国人民的利益是不能分离的，只有中国人民的胜利，才能保障工商业的繁荣与发展，这是今年调整工商业以后的情况可以证明的。民族工商业者懂得这一点，过去被侵略被压迫的历史以及一年多来人民政府对于工商业的扶助与维护，都证明了这一点。因此，在这次抗美援朝运动中，中国民族工商业者，至少其中的多数人，是懂得把他们个别的利益与整个民族的利益结合起来的，所以，有这样积极的表现。这种意味着进步与团结的行动，应该看作抗美援朝的力量中很重要的一个方面。
    抗美援朝将是一个长期的斗争。最近中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军，虽曾给美帝国主义以重大的打击，在朝鲜战场上，取得了决定性的胜利，但这并不等于说，抗美援朝工作已可告一段落。由于帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，不甘于被注定要加速的走向灭亡，而将进行垂死的疯狂的挣扎，因此，更长期的更艰巨的斗争，还在后面。中国民族工商业者在整个斗争中所应当担负起来的工作，也是中国人民所希望于他们的，将愈来愈重大。下面想指出其中最重要的几项：
    第一、中国民族工商业者，不但应当努力把它们的业务搞好，如增加生产，扩大流通，减低成本，保证品质，而且应当进一步的向政府靠拢，接受国营经济的领导，使公私的力量结合在一起，使原料得到合理的分配，使产品得到合理的配售，使市场得到合理的供应。这也就是说，使私营企业能够被组织进国家经济总计划之中，使生产与消费能适当的平衡，这样既可以减少浪费，又可以使全国的力量得到最经济的使用，并且发挥最大的效力。在今年五月以后，政府执行调整工商业的工作中，也曾把私营企业尽可能地组织进整个计划之内，因而取得了宏大的效果。但，这种工作做得是不够的，特别是私营企业方面，总还不肯坦白真诚地把它们的设备、生产能力、资金使用、原料储备、产品销售等情形完全说出来，有的是对公家有顾虑，有的是私私之间更有问题；他们往往只在困难的时候“靠拢”一点，及至情况好转，便想尽量摆脱过去的“约束”，冀图更大的“自由”。这样的情形，对于今后抗美援朝运动中的要求，将表现为极度的不够与脆弱。今后的要求，就是公私的力量，必须结合在一起，私营企业必须服从国营经济的领导，国营经济必须保障私营企业的正常发展。应当认清：脱离整体的个体，违反大利的小利，必将陷于灭亡，只有把个体服从整体，小利服从大利，我们才能取得胜利。
    第二、抗美援朝工作的展开，我们相信一定可以给侵略者以足够使他清醒的沉重的打击，而且我们已经这样做了。但是帝国主义不会清醒的，特别是美帝，他的疯狂以及一味扩大侵略的行为，将使我们不得不以很大的力量投入有关国防的一切设施中。在这种情况之下，经济市场的稳定，将是经济战线上另一工作的目标，而且这种工作与前方的胜利，有着极密切的关系的。我们要承认，在战争时期，经济市场是极容易发生动乱的，然而为了胜利，我们必须使经济市场稳定下来。在战时，经济市场被扰乱的因素很多，如物资供应的缺乏，运输的困难，战争的破坏，以及谣言等。对于这一切，今天人民政府有把握地可以加以适当的克服。我们不敢说：某一个地方，在某一个短时期内，某一种物品，因为一时供应的缺少，因而发生了市场上的或多或少的波动，象这样的情形都不会有，但是基本上说来，政府对于稳定市场是有足够的把握的。具体说来，与人民生活最有重要关系的无非衣食两个方面，由于今年全国的普遍丰收，粮食生产在二千四百亿斤以上、棉花生产在一千四百二十万担以上，以今年的粮食消费情形及下半年的纱厂开工情形来说，已可使明年粮食与纱布的供应有足够的保障，此外，茶叶、丝蚕、麻类、蛋品、肉类等的大量增产，以及下半年来调整工商业后，城乡交流的发展，与工商业的繁荣，这一切，有的是增加外汇的收入，有的是充裕市场的供应，这一良好的基础，大大的有利于明年市场的稳定的。还有最重要的一点，我们可以相信政府的，就是在一切可以影响经济市场的因素之上，决不再增加一项最最致命的因素，就是通货膨胀。由于在财经统一以后，我们基本上已经结束了国民党反动派所遗留下来的十二年来的通货膨胀的历史，今天人民政府的财政，完全遵照毛主席三种巩固工作的指示，建筑在收支接近平衡的基础上。没有这一项致命的因素，我们相信纵然今后局势再紧张一点，经济市场局部的轻微的波动或许是不能避免的，但是象过去那种大风大浪，基本上决不会发生。这自然是只说了一个方面，还有一个方面就是工商界与市场关系的问题。从一个正当的工商业者说来，也就是从绝大多数的工商业者说来，市场稳定，对于他们是有利的，十二年来的痛苦经验，已充分的说明了这一点；然而极少数的想混水摸鱼投机捣把的败类，在今天也不能说完全绝迹。因此，另一方面，稳定市场，安定人心，将是民族工商业者的重要任务之一，他们应当配合政府的方针，以自己作榜样，拿自己的力量，来稳定市场，同时在自己的同业中，监视这些少数的败类，肃清一切谣言，使所有扰乱市场的行为无法发生。为了稳定市场与合理供应，对于几种日用必需品，政府将实施一些管制的办法，有的已经做了，对于这些管制，民族工商业者不但应该接受，而且在执行的过程中，应该予政府以充分的协助。经济战线上的胜利，无疑地不仅安定了后方的人心，而且将大大的鼓励前方的士气。
    第三、为了加强国防力量，不庸讳言，政府今后财政上的支出将有所增加，然而这对于收支平衡仍然不会发生重大影响的，因为政府对于收支平衡的工作，决心要巩固下去的。这巩固工作一方面，就是收入不能减少，因此，有一件事必须向全国民族工商业者郑重提出的，就是缴税问题。自从今年六月间全国税务会议以来，政府对工商业所负担的一部分捐税，作了很大的修改，例如税目减少了，征税手续简化了，税率减低了，甚至滞纳的罚金，也作了很大的减低。这一切，政府为了照顾工商业当时的困难，虽在财政并不宽裕的情况下，仍毅然决然地实行了的。税率的减低与税制的改进，对于下半年工商业的恢复，显然是起了作用的，但有些地方由此发生了偏差，就是有些工商业者，认为政府是可欺的，对于应缴的捐税任意拖延，这种现象的严重程度，仅以上海的例子而言，已引起了上海市协商委员会的郑重讨论与严厉批评。这种放弃自己应尽的责任，轻视拖延缴税甚至逃税的现象，将严重地妨碍国家财政的基础。对于这些害群之马没有国家民族观念的落后分子，除了政府应当依照法律严厉制裁外，民族工商业者应当发动组织的力量，加以教育，加以督策。因为平心而论，六月税务会议所修订的税制，对于工商业的负担，可以说是毫不苛重，极为平允，这是工商业者一致承认的。今天政府为了抗美援朝，增加支出，只把增加的部分向其他的开支上削补，而没有打算到增加税率来加重工商业的负担，这已经是天公地道的了。如果工商业者不从踊跃缴税上，来表示他们对于政府的信仰与支持，对于抗美援朝的决心，还有什么更好的方法来证明这一切呢？
    第四、抗美援朝是全国人民的事，没有全国人民的力量是不能取得胜利的，在各地工商界的爱国公约中，我们都看到这样一条，就是说：供献出全部的力量，来支援前线。这句辉煌的誓言，将永远被写在中国人民反抗帝国主义的历史上。支援前线的工作，方面极多，其中就供献财力物力而言，在今天的四个朋友中，民族工商业者无疑地最有可能。这种工作，不但表现了自己的认识与决心，而且可以教育和鼓舞其它的工商业者，对于朝鲜当然更是很大的鼓励。在朝鲜前线，我们取得了这样伟大的胜利之后，各地已经展开慰问的运动，我们相信工商界一定有出色的表现。支援前线的工作，进一步说：我们不应当机械地解释为捐献一些款项和物资，支援前线，实在是可以看作整个的经济动员，因为只有这样，才能够更有效地满足前线的要求。我们应当设想到，今后敌人会对我们实行恶毒的经济封锁，今后敌人可能会轰炸我们的都市，毁坏我们的工业，使我们很多的物资感觉到缺乏，使我们尚未改组完成的半殖民地经济格外露出许多破绽，这时候，民族工商业者应当发挥供献一切的力量支援前线的精神，紧密地团结在政府的周围，服从政府的指挥，抛弃小我的目前的利益，为了争取整体的长远的生存与发展。那时候民族工商业者有些个别的事业，可能遭受毁坏与牺牲的，然而中国人民的胜利，将来一定会使这种牺牲，不但得到补偿，而且可以有更大的发展。
    第五、今天全国工商界，对于抗美援朝的时事学习是积极的，但是在数量上讲，不够广泛，在程度上讲，不够深入。最显著的情形，就是在较大的一些工商业者方面，思想上的顾虑还没有完全解除，在有些中小工商业者方面，思想上对于敌视美帝的程度，还嫌不够，整个说来，对于这样一个关系我们国家存亡的时事问题的学习，还缺少有组织的有领导的动员，而且与自己业务方面也嫌结合得不够。要知道，美帝国主义在它侵略中国几十年中，是竭尽欺骗与伪装的能事的，在国民党反动派统治的二十余年中，它一方面无耻地对人民宣扬美帝主子的恩德，一方面对苏联制造出种种无奇不有的谣言与诬蔑。二十几年的时间不是短的，因此，今天要分清敌友，认识美帝的侵略性，以及以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中的这种兄弟般的友爱关系，不应当看作一件很容易的事。在这种情况下，广泛深入而且长期地展开学习，使这种风气贯彻于整个的工商界，实在是一件十分必要的事，应当看作今后的任务之一。
    中国民族工商业者在过去几十年来反帝的斗争中，曾表现出不少的成就，这一年来在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，民族工商业者又大大地提高了一步，相信这四个朋友之一，在抗美援朝运动中，一定能够发出一分热与光，一定能够完成其应完成的任务的。
