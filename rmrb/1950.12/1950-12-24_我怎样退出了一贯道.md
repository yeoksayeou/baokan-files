In the area under the jurisdiction of the Seventh Police Station of the Outer First Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, there is an old man named Geng Zhizhong who pushes a cart selling thread. After seeing the Beijing Municipal People's Government's announcement on banning Yiguandao, he excitedly narrated his story of how he was deceived into joining Yiguandao and later awakened with the help of a worker and quit.

"Three years ago, our only son died of illness. At fifty years old, losing my only child was incredibly painful. Yiguandao took advantage of this and came to 'guide' me into the religion, saying that joining the religion could avoid eighty-one tribulations and even see my deceased child. I was already a bit superstitious, so I was muddle-headed and joined.

Later, I also participated in their 'immortal Buddha training class'. Rich people had to pay a lot of 'heart-dedication fees'. I didn't have money to give, so the altar master came up with a way to have me contribute my labor, sweeping their Buddhist hall every day.

During the day, I pushed my cart all day, my back ached, and at night I had to sweep the Buddhist hall for them, pour water for the rich people, and pick up and drop off the wealthy followers in the middle of the night. It was really unbearable. But the altar master said, 'Rich people are flowers, poor people are leaves, and the leaves must support the flowers well. Poor people must serve the rich.' So I willingly let them use me.

Once, the altar master wanted me to go and 'persuade' others to join the religion. I found some poor fellows and tried to persuade them, but they didn't join, and I felt a little embarrassed. When I returned, the altar master said, 'To persuade others, you must have the face of a turtle, the legs of a rabbit, and the stomach of a prime minister. You can't lack any of them.' He also said, 'Persuading a thousand, persuading ten thousand, is not as good as persuading one who is 'on the register' (a rich person).' I never understood why rich people were so good, that even the gods and Buddhas liked them.

After joining the religion, you're not allowed to eat meat. The altar master said, 'You're not allowed to kill living beings, not even bedbugs.' But I saw that the altar master and the 'point transmitter' were wearing silk robes with fox fur linings, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong.

One day, a worker from Qiancheng Hardware Store named Yu Jingbo came and also helped me sweep the Buddhist hall. It turned out that his boss had joined the religion and ordered the workers to do this. Furthermore, his boss forced the workers to join the religion so that everyone would eat vegetarian food, saving the boss money. At night, the workers weren't allowed to turn on the electric lights to catch bedbugs, supposedly for fear of killing living things, but in reality, it was to save electricity.

Yu Jingbo didn't sweep the Buddhist hall with the same reverence as I did. When wiping the Buddha statues, he picked up a 'Buddha' and spat on it before wiping, which scared me. I said that he would be struck by lightning. Yu Jingbo said, 'Don't believe this nonsense.' After a few days, Yu Jingbo was still very healthy, and I began to have my doubts.

One night, the two of us were together again, and Yu Jingbo encouraged me to steal the offerings to eat. How could I dare? But he ate them heartily. After a few days, I also stole a few to try, and nothing happened, so I became somewhat disbelieving.

But I still didn't dare to touch the yellow chair that the 'point transmitter' sat on, because the 'point transmitter' would be possessed by a god as soon as he sat on it. But Yu Jingbo often sat on the chair and dozed off. One day, he insisted that I sit on it too. I mustered up the courage to sit on it and try it, and damn it, it was just like an ordinary chair, nothing happened! I saw through all these tricks, and from then on, I quit the religion and no longer believed in this nonsense."

Geng Zhizhong expressed his firm support for the government's measures to ban Yiguandao. He said, "These evil guys have done all kinds of bad things, but in the past, the reactionaries treated them like treasures and used them to deceive the masses. Now that the people are in charge, we will never allow them to cause trouble again."

    我怎样退出了一贯道
    耿志忠口述菊逢、戈行笔记
    京市公安局外一分局第七派出所所辖地区有一位推车卖线的老头耿志忠，看到了北京市人民政府关于取缔一贯道的布告以后，兴奋地叙述了他当初受骗参加一贯道和后来在一位工人的帮助下觉悟过来退出了一贯道的故事：
    “三年前，咱们老夫妻俩的独生子病死了，五十岁的人丧了命根子，心痛得不行。一贯道钻了空子，就来渡我入道，说入了道可免八十一劫，还可以看到死掉的孩子。我本来就有点迷信，他这么一劝，我就糊里糊涂入了道。
    后来又参加了他们的仙佛训练班，有钱人要缴很多很多献心费，我没钱可出，坛主想了一个办法，叫我出力，天天给他们打扫佛堂。
    白天推一天车，腰酸背疼，晚上得给他们扫佛堂，给有钱人倒水，半夜三更还得接送有钱的道友，可真有些受不了。可是坛主说：‘有钱人是花，穷人是叶，叶得好好扶着花，穷人就得侍候富人。’我就这样甘心情愿地给他们使唤。
    有一次，坛主要我去劝道了，我找了些穷哥儿们劝了又劝，人家不入，我就有些不好意思。回来坛主说：‘劝道就得有王八脸、兔子腿、宰相肚子，缺一不行。’又说：‘劝一千劝一万，不如劝一个上案的（有钱人）’。我总是不明白有钱人就这样好，连神佛老爷也喜欢。
    入了道不准吃荤。坛主说：‘不准杀生，连臭虫也不许弄死。’可是我看见坛主和点传师都穿着丝绸袍子，狐皮里子，心里越想越不对劲。
    有一天来了一位谦成五金行的工人叫于景波的，也帮着我打扫佛堂，原来他掌柜的入了道，叫工人这么干。并且他掌柜还强迫工人都入道，为了好叫工人大家吃素，给掌柜省钱，晚上还不许工人开电灯捉臭虫，说是怕杀生，其实是怕费电。
    于景波扫佛堂可不像我必恭必敬的。擦佛像时他拿起一个‘佛爷’，‘呸！’地吐上一大口唾沫才擦起来，把我吓了一大跳，我说这可要天打雷劈呀。于景波说：‘别信他这一套。’过了几天，于景波还是挺健壮，我就有些疑心起来了。
    一天夜里，我们两个又在一起，于景波就动员我偷供果吃，我怎么敢呢？可是他却大吃起来了。过了几天，我也偷吃几个试试，结果什么事儿也没有，我就有些不信了。
    可是我始终不敢碰那把点传师坐的黄椅子，因为点传师一坐上就会上神。可是于景波却常坐在椅子上打瞌睡。有一天他非得让我也坐一下不行，我放大胆子坐上去一试，他妈的，还不是和普通椅子一样没事儿！这套鬼把戏都叫我识穿了，从此我就退了道，再不信这玩意儿了。”
    对政府取缔一贯道的措施，耿志忠表示坚决拥护。他说：“这些鬼家伙，坏事做尽了，可是过去反动派把他们当宝贝，用来欺骗群众；今天人民当了家，决不允许他们再捣乱。”
