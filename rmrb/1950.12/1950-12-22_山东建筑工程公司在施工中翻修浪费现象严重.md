To the Editor:

The Shandong Construction Engineering Company, due to the serious bureaucratic work style of its leading cadres and a lack of planning in construction, has caused significant losses to the people's property. From January to October of this year, the company had to rework 18 projects due to design errors and cutting corners, and 14 projects were overdue for completion.

When contracting to build warehouses for the Salt Industry Company's Huangtai Salt Factory, the salt factory provided a draft for reference. The person responsible for the project did not review it and proceeded to construct according to the draft. During the construction period, there was continuous autumn rain, coupled with the dereliction of duty by the person in charge. The foundation was not properly compacted, leading to the upper section of the north section of the east warehouse wall tilting, resulting in rework and a loss of 6,360,155 RMB. Furthermore, due to improper design, the warehouse collapsed shortly after construction and had to be rebuilt, resulting in an estimated loss of no less than several billions RMB of the people's property. Another example is the contracting of four oil depots for a certain military unit. From contracting, design, to construction, only one technical person was responsible. During the construction, this person never visited the site, and the leadership ignored the situation. The design was inaccurate, and corners were cut, with too much soil and too little lime. As a result, within a few months of completion, three of the four oil depots had collapsed, and the other one had to be completely rebuilt. This alone resulted in an estimated loss of 240 million RMB. In addition, contracting the construction of the Renfeng Textile Factory's workers' children's school and the Bethune Medical College's housing also resulted in significant losses. Before the major flood this year, the company contracted to repair the dangerous water gate at Qijiazui in Lijin County, lower reaches of the Yellow River, but did not follow the contract. Out of 280 round piles, only about 100 were up to standard. As the major flood was imminent, these substandard round piles were reluctantly used. The stone masonry also did not meet the standards, with improper grouting between the stone joints (leading to water leakage). About one-third of the cement in the aggregate was ineffective due to moisture, and the usage was one-quarter less than the normal proportion (a total of 150 bags of cement were used less than normal for the entire project). Delaying the completion by 23 days past the original date, this type of important Yellow River project related to the life and property of the broad masses of the people, was delayed for many days during the flood season, and corner-cutting was dared, which is an extremely irresponsible performance towards the life and property of the state and the people. As another example, when contracting to repair the First Rainbow Bridge, not only was the project not completed on time, but the price was underestimated due to a lack of thorough investigation and understanding of the situation, resulting in a loss of 40,000 to 60,000 jin of millet for the company.

The company is also extremely irresponsible in the purchase, use, and storage of materials. 227 rolls of tar felt were purchased from Shanghai at 650,000 RMB per roll (including freight). After inspection, not only were the brands mixed and non-standard, but they were all semi-waste products and could not be used. They had to be sold at 200,000 RMB per roll, resulting in a loss of over 100 million RMB. 5 billion RMB was spent to purchase 2,000 cubic meters of wood from Northeast China. After transportation, it was found that 40 percent of it could not be used, which was another huge loss. When contracting the Bethune Medical College project, the carpentry factory was urged to rush the production of more than 10,000 pieces of wood panels. After they were made, they were left unused due to changes in the project. This batch of wood is worth more than 9 million RMB. The Xuzhou branch of the company needed steel bars and bought them in Jinan at 3 million RMB per ton, but they sent people to Shanghai to buy them at 6 million RMB per ton. After buying them, instead of unloading them directly in Xuzhou, they transported them to Jinan first and then transferred them to Xuzhou, resulting in further waste. Other equipment and materials were often abandoned and stolen, and no one cared. The company's car drivers organized the theft of nearly 2,000 jin of gasoline, worth over 14 million RMB. Some backward workers organized the theft of materials, which was discovered by the Public Security Bureau, but the company was completely unaware.

Dai Qihua, the manager of the company, and Zhang Guishi and Li Nianzhen, the deputy managers, are not familiar with the business and are unwilling to learn. They do not study the monthly reports sent by the lower levels or the instructions sent by the higher levels. They do not inspect the projects. Reports to higher authorities are simply handed over to a secretary to handle and then forgotten.

After this rectification movement, the leading cadres of the company have had a preliminary understanding of the above-mentioned serious waste, but the self-criticism is still very incomplete. In their summary report to the Industry Bureau, the huge loss of about 1 billion RMB due to the re-repairing of the Huangtai warehouse of the Salt Industry Company was only lightly touched upon. The cutting corners of the Yellow River dangerous engineering repair project, which is related to the life and property of the broad masses, was not mentioned at all. Recently, the company's Shengsheng Flour Mill violated the state's price policy and privately sold 3,000 bags of wheat (200 jin per bag) at a high price outside the exchange. These situations should be publicly criticized; the responsible cadres of the company should thoroughly self-criticize.

    山东建筑工程公司在施工中翻修浪费现象严重
    编者同志：
    山东建筑工程公司，由于领导干部存在严重的官僚主义作风，在施工上的无计划，致造成了人民财产的重大损失。从今年一月至十月的十个月中，该公司因设计错误、偷工减料而重新翻修的工程即达十八处，逾期未完工者十四处。
    在承修盐业公司黄台盐厂库房时，盐厂曾送去一张草图，供作参考。该工程负责人员对此并未审查，即按草图施工。施工期中，恰当秋雨连绵，又加上负责人的渎职，地基未打坚固，致东库北段墙上段倾斜，因而翻修，损失人民币六、三六○、一五五元；更因设计欠妥，修建不久即行倒塌，重新修建，估计损失人民财产不下十数亿元。又如包建某部队油库四处，从承包、设计以至施工，仅有一位技术人员负责办理，而在施工当中，该人员从未亲临现场照顾，领导上更是不闻不问。这次设计因不够精确，偷工减料，土多灰少，结果竣工不到数月，四个油库已有三个塌毁，另一个亦必须全部重新翻工，仅此一项，约计损失人民币二亿四千万元。另外，如包修仁丰纱厂工人子弟学校、白求恩医学院房舍，都造成了巨大的损失。今年大汛前，承包黄河下游利津县綦家嘴的险工水闸，竟不照合同办事，在二百八十根圆桩中，合格者仅一百根左右。当时因大汛在即，无奈地将这些不合格的圆桩勉强凑用；在砌石上也不按标准，石口衔接间灌浆不严（有漏水的现象），三合土内，约有三分之一的洋灰因受潮失效，使用量上，比正常规定比例，减少了四分之一（全部工程少用一百五十袋洋灰）。且逾原定日期二十三天后才完工。这样关系广大人民生命财产安全的黄河险要工程，在汛期侵袭时，迟延多日，并敢偷工减料，确是对国家人民生命财产极不负责的表现。又如包修第一虹桥时，不仅不能如期完成工程，且因不周密勘查了解情况，而估价过低，公司亏损了四万至六万斤小米。
    该公司在材料的购买、使用、保管方面，也极不负责。从上海买来油毛毡二百二十七卷，每卷六十五万元（运费在内），经检查后，不但牌子杂乱不合规格，而且全系半废品，无法使用，只得按二十万一卷出售，损失了一亿余元。以五十亿元去东北买木料二千立方公尺，运到后，发现有百分之四十无法使用，这又是一项庞大的损失。包修白求恩医学院工程时，催促木工厂赶制木板一万余片，制成后，因工程变化，迄今放置无用，这项木料约值九百余万元。该公司徐州分公司需用钢筋，在济南买每吨三百万元，但他们却派人到上海去用每吨六百万元收购；而且在买好以后，又不直接在徐州卸货，却运到济南后再调拨徐州，以致又浪费很大。其他器材、物料常见遗弃，被人偷窃，也无人过问。该公司汽车驾驶员，有组织的偷汽油，约近二千余斤，合人民币一千四百余万元。某些落后工人组织起来偷工料，被公安局查出来，该公司竟毫无所知。
    该公司经理戴启华，副经理张贵时、李念珍三人对业务不熟悉，也不愿学习。下级送来的月报，上级发来的指示，他们也不研究。对于工程，也不检查。对上级机关的报告，仅仅交给一位秘书办理，发出完事。
    经过此次整风运动，该公司领导干部对上述严重浪费现象已有了初步认识，但检讨还很不彻底。在他们呈报工业厅的总结报告中，对盐业公司黄台仓库的重新翻修损失十亿元左右的巨大损失，仅轻描淡写地谈了一谈。有关广大群众生命财产的黄河险工承修工程的偷工减料一事，根本就没有提及。近来该公司所属生生面粉厂又发生了违犯国家的价格政策，私自在交易所外高价卖出小麦三千包（每包二百斤）。这些情况，都应公开批评；该公司负责干部都应彻底检讨。
