Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 2nd. Chinese atomic physicist Professor Zhao Zhongyao and twenty students who returned from the United States and Canada on the same ship, after staying in Guangzhou for three days and visiting various construction projects, have departed for Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan to work. Having personally experienced persecution by American imperialism, Professor Zhao and others, after returning to the motherland, immediately took practical action to respond to the call to resist America and aid Korea, collectively donating one million RMB to express their sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, and sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to fight resolutely for the motherland's construction and the War to Resist America and Aid Korea.
