    Two Poems
    Peace Doves are Flying
    Peace doves are flying,
    Over the city of Warsaw risen from the ruins,
    In the minds of over two thousand peace fighters representing seventy countries,
    Over every rooftop sending up smoke,
    Over every brightly lit window,
    In the blue sky without the clouds of fascism,
    Peace doves are flying.
    Peace doves are flying,
    They spread their powerful wings,
    Through the dark clouds, through the fog,
    Flying to England, flying to the factories of Sheffield,
    Flying over mountains and forests, flying over the ocean,
    Flying to America, flying to Union Square in New York,
    Peace doves are flying.
    Peace doves are flying,
    They fly to workshops, fly to farms,
    Fly into the classrooms of elementary school children,
    Flying to every place built for peace,
    Visiting all those persecuted, enslaved, and injured by fascism,
    All those threatened and devastated by war,
    Peace doves are flying.
    Peace doves are flying,
    Where they fly, there is hope,
    People all over the world coalesce into one force,
    The hearts of hundreds of millions, it is an image,
    Truman, Attlee, futile madness,
    The fascist clutches can never resist:
    Peace doves will continue to fly.
    (On November 17, 1950, the People's Daily published the peace dove painted by the great French painter Picasso as a tribute to the Second World Peace Congress, with a caption titled "Peace Doves are Flying.")
    William McCarther
    American imperialism is a scourge of peace,
    The power of peace will surely eliminate it;
    Among the American people there are also peace fighters,
    William McCarther is one of them.
    On August 2, 1950, in New York,
    A storm of the masses surged in Union Square:
    "We want work, we want peace, we don't want aggression!"
    Thunderous slogans threatened to topple skyscrapers.
    The police were dispatched, the mounted police were dispatched,
    The Wall Street police dogs panicked,
    Beating with whips, beating with clubs,
    The people who fought for peace feared nothing.
    William McCarther is a brave sailor,
    His anger is like a hurricane on the sea,
    He climbed the telephone pole, waving a placard like a standard-bearer,
    Shouting "We want work, we want peace, oppose war!"
    The police chased after him, the ladders were erected,
    McCarther still shouted, waving the placard:
    "I am a father, I will not let American sons be cannon fodder,
    I support peace, I demand the withdrawal of the invading troops!"
    He was beaten and put in shackles,
    Protesting in court, he remained steadfast:
    "What you want to win, you can only win through struggle,
    Being beaten, going to jail, cannot scare us; fighting for peace is the most important thing!"
    One McCarther is locked up,
    Millions of McCarthers rushed out,
    A single spark can start a prairie fire,
    People all over the world continue to move forward!
    (The incident is from "The American Progressive People Fight for Peace" by Soviet Ozroov, published in the "Special Issue on Defending World Peace" of the People's Daily on November 20, 1950.)

### 诗二首

    诗二首
    和平鸽子在飞翔
    和平鸽子在飞翔，
    在从废墟中站起来的华沙城上，
    在代表七十个国家的两千多和平战士的思想上，
    在每一个冒着炊烟的屋顶上，
    在每一个透着亮光的橱窗上，
    在没有法西斯阴云的蓝天上，
    和平鸽子在飞翔。
    和平鸽子在飞翔，
    它展开了刚劲的翅膀，
    穿过阴云，穿过雾，
    飞向英伦，飞向设菲尔德的工厂，
    飞过山林，飞过海洋，
    飞向美利坚，飞向纽约的联合广场，
    和平鸽子在飞翔。
    和平鸽子在飞翔，
    它飞向车间，飞向农庄，
    飞入小学生们的课堂，
    飞向一切为和平而建设的地方，
    所有被法西斯所迫害、所奴役、所损伤的，
    所有被战争所威胁、所破坏的，它都去拜访，
    和平鸽子在飞翔。
    和平鸽子在飞翔，
    它飞到那里，那里就是希望，
    全世界人民凝结成一股力量，
    十万万人心，它是一个形象，
    杜鲁门，艾德礼，徒然的疯狂，
    法西斯魔掌绝不能抵挡：
    和平鸽子要继续飞翔。
    （一九五零年十一月十七日，人民日报刊载了法国大画家毕加索所作献给第二届世界保卫和平大会的和平鸽子，并有说明，题曰《和平鸽子在飞翔》。）
    威廉·麦加瑟
    美帝国主义是和平的灾祸，
    和平的力量终必把它消灭；
    美国的人民中也有和平战士，
    威廉·麦加瑟就是其中的一个。
    一九五零年的八月二号，在纽约，
    联合广场上涌起了群众的风暴：
    “要工作，要和平，我们不要侵略！”
    霹雷般的口号要把摩天大楼震倒。
    警察出动了，骑警出动了，
    华尔街的警犬们慌了手脚，
    用鞭子打，用棍子打，
    为和平而斗争的人民什么也不怕。
    威廉·麦加瑟是一个勇敢的水手，
    他的愤怒是大海上的狂风，
    他攀上电杆，摇着标语牌，像个旗手，
    高喊着“要工作，要和平，反对战争！”
    警察追过来，梯子竖起来，
    麦加瑟依然呼喊，摇着标语牌：
    “我是父亲，我不让美国的儿子去当炮灰，
    我拥护和平，我要求把侵略的军队撤回！”
    他被打伤了，又带上了铁镣，
    在法庭上抗议，他毫不动摇：
    “要赢得什么，只有用斗争才能赢到，
    挨打，坐牢，吓不倒；为和平而斗争最重要！”
    一个麦加瑟被关起来，
    千万个麦加瑟冲出来，
    星星之火可以燎原，
    全世界人民继续向前！
    （事见一九五零年十一月二十日人民日报《保卫世界和平专刊》所载苏联奥兹罗夫作《美国进步人民为和平而斗争》。）
