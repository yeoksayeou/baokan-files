Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: According to incomplete statistics up to late November, more than 7,400 Christian believers in Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces have signed the reform manifesto issued by Chinese Christian figures. Signatories include Zhang Haisong, Bishop of the Anglican Church of China's Hubei-Hunan Diocese, Chen Zhimei, General Secretary of the Fujian Christian Association, Hu Huantang, President of the Shaanxi-Gansu General Assembly of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and leaders, representatives, and believers from more than 70 Christian organizations. Among them, 2,785 people signed in Hubei and Hunan provinces, more than 2,300 in Fujian Province, 940 in the four cities of Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, and Ji'an in Jiangxi Province, and 878 in Jinan City, Shandong Province.

　　Local Christians, in coordination with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, have launched publicity for religious reform. Christians in Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Nanping, and other places in Fujian Province have held symposiums and lectures on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Church groups and church schools in Fuzhou City have universally launched current affairs studies, and Tan Renmei, Dean of Studies at Fujian Union University, also wrote an article in the Fujian Daily, calling on Christians to recognize the imperialists' conspiracy to use religion for aggression in their studies. The declaration issued by the Jinan Christian Association pointed out that it is necessary to heighten vigilance and promptly expose and eliminate imperialist saboteurs who have infiltrated our country's religious circles. Forty-one representatives from twenty-six Christian organizations in Hangzhou City unanimously passed the "Patriotic Covenant of Christian Figures" and called on Christians in the city to abide by this covenant. Representatives of various church groups in Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Ji'an and other places in Jiangxi Province held a forum to discuss the reform manifesto. Pastors in Nanchang City also went to various churches and parishioners' homes to publicize the content of the reform manifesto, and now the number of signatories in the city has reached half of the total number of Christians in the city. One hundred and nine representatives of Christian organizations in various parts of Jiangxi Province also held the Fourth Advanced Study Conference in Nanchang in the middle of last month. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to support the reform manifesto and called on Christians throughout the province to sign the manifesto; responding to the call of the National Christian Council of China, guaranteeing that each church group will complete the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation within five years.
