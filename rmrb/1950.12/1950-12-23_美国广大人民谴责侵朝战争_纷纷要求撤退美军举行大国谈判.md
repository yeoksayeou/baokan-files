Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd Dispatch: TASS Moscow, December 21st Dispatch: *Pravda* reporters Rassadin and Filippov's New York correspondence reports on people's protests against American war hysteria. The reporters pointed out: The failure of MacArthur's November offensive in Korea has had a serious mental and political impact on the broad masses of the American people. The illusory hope of ending the Korean War has been shattered. In its place is unease and panic. Truman's famous statement on November 30, with its threats against the Korean and Chinese people and its guarantee of a new offensive of war hysteria, has aggravated the Americans' panic. More and more Americans are beginning to realize that the danger of war is growing. Therefore, there is no doubt that actions to defend peace are becoming more frequent across the country.

Not long ago, about 300 wives and mothers of Marine soldiers spontaneously held a meeting after reading in the newspaper that the Marine Corps was surrounded in the mountains of northeastern Korea. At the meeting, they angrily spoke of how "Washington's leadership" had condemned their husbands and sons to meaningless annihilation. They also demanded the recall of American troops from the Korean front.

In Los Angeles, a delegation of housewives came to the City Council meeting place, demanding that the City Council submit a request to Congress to withdraw troops from Korea.

Among church people, dissatisfaction with the government's Korean adventure is also spreading more and more widely. Because of the mood of broad layers of believers, even organizations such as the National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States—a large church group in the United States—advocate holding great power negotiations. Bishop Sherrill, the leader of this organization, telegraphed Truman, supporting the idea of holding great power negotiations.

Large quantities of letters and telegrams are pouring into Congress every day, and this flood of correspondence reflects the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the American imperialist's criminal war adventure in the Far East.

Rassadin and Filippov continued, saying that the reactionary newspapers are frantically continuing to defend Truman and Acheson's policies. However, some newspapers can no longer hide the growing unease and panic among the people, especially the newspapers in various states. The *Charleston Gazette* of West Virginia said in an editorial on the Korean War: This war is extremely unjust. The war in Asia is Truman's war, and he wants to force the United States to win this war at any cost. The President has jumped straight into the water. But never let him drag the whole of the United States in with him.

Despite the opposition of the corrupt top leadership of the CIO and the AFL, more and more local trade union organizations are demanding an end to American intervention in the Far East.

Under the pressure of the growing indignation of the working people, some representatives of the American bourgeoisie have had to express their demands to reconsider the direction of American foreign policy. The "Dover Group" of powerful industrialists and financiers in the New England states of eastern America recently telegraphed Truman, stating the necessity of withdrawing American troops from Korea, withdrawing the US Seventh Fleet from Taiwan, and allowing the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations.

Rassadin and Filippov concluded: But the facts show that Washington does not intend to consider the sentiments of American workers and the sober voices of the business community. Truman's broadcast speech on December 15 once again confirmed that what the American ruling clique wants is war, not peace.

Whether war-mongers can drag the American people into new war adventures depends on the persistence and determination of American peace fighters.

    美国广大人民谴责侵朝战争
    纷纷要求撤退美军举行大国谈判
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：真理报记者拉萨丁与费利波夫的纽约通讯报道人们对美国战争歇斯底里的抗议。记者指出：麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的军队的十一月攻势的失败，在美国广大的人民群众中，发生了严重的精神上与政治上的影响。结束朝鲜战争的虚幻的希望破灭了。代之而起的是不安与惊惶。杜鲁门著名的十一月三十日的声明带着对朝鲜与中国人民的威胁，并保证要作新的战争歇斯底里的进攻，这个声明使美国人的惊惶更加剧了。美国开始认识战争危险越来越大的人每一天都在增加。因此，毫无疑问，全国各地保卫和平的行动也更加频繁了。
    不久前，陆战队士兵的妻子和母亲约三百人，从报上看到陆战队被包围在朝鲜东北部的山中，她们自发地举行集会，在会上愤怒地谈到“华盛顿的领导”使她们的丈夫与儿子陷于无意义的被歼灭的命运。她们并要求从朝鲜前线召回美国军队。
    在洛杉矶，有一个家庭主妇代表团来到市议会开会的地方，要求市议会向国会提出从朝鲜撤退军队的要求。
    在教会人士间，不满政府的朝鲜冒险的情绪，也在日益广泛地扩展着。因为考虑到广大的各阶层教徒的情绪，甚至象美国基督教会全国委员会——美国的大的教会团体——之类的组织，也主张举行大国谈判。这个组织的领袖谢利尔主教致电杜鲁门，支持举行大国谈判的意见。
    大批的信件和电报每日不断地涌入国会，这些函电的洪流也反映出美国人民不满美帝国主义在远东的罪恶战争冒险的情绪在日益增长。
    拉萨丁和费利波夫继续说，反动报纸疯狂地继续为杜鲁门和艾奇逊的政策辩护。然而一部分报纸却再也不能掩盖人民当中日渐增长的不安和惊慌了，各州的报纸情形尤其是这样。西弗吉尼亚州的《通讯者》报在关于朝鲜战争的社论中称：这个战争是极其不义的。在亚洲进行的战事是杜鲁门的战争，他要强迫美国不惜以任何牺牲来打胜这个战争。总统已经径直跳进水里去了。但是决不要让他把整个美国也拖进去。
    尽管腐化的产联和劳联最高领导机构的反对，愈来愈多的地方工会组织都要求结束美国在远东的干涉。
    在劳动人民日益增长的愤慨的压力下，美国资产阶级的某些代表人物不得不表示要求重新考虑美国外交政策的方针。美国东部新英格兰诸州有势力的工业家和金融家的“多佛集团”最近致电杜鲁门，说明自朝鲜撤退美军，自台湾撤退美国第七舰队和允许中华人民共和国参加联合国的必要性。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫结语称：但是事实表明：华盛顿是不打算考虑美国劳动者的情绪和企业界的清醒的声音的。杜鲁门十二月十五日的广播演说再一次地证实了美国统治集团所要求的是战争，而不是和平。
    战争贩子能否把美国人民拖进新的战争冒险，决定于美国的和平战士的坚持与毅力。
