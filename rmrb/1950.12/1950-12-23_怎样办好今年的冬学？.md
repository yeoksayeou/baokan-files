	How to Run This Year's Winter School Well?

	With the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country having become the central struggle task of all Chinese people today, the development of this year's winter school movement is of even greater significance than in any previous year.

	The winter school, a widespread and effective mass education organization, has a deep influence and mass base in the vast rural areas of the old liberated areas. Every year, farmers use their winter leisure time to participate in winter schools to learn culture, politics, and current affairs knowledge, discuss the various policies and work of the People's Government, as well as their own life and production issues, thereby improving their cultural level and ideological and political awareness, and promoting various tasks. During the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the vast rural areas behind enemy lines universally carried out education on protracted resistance in winter schools, enabling the broad masses of farmers to foresee the prospect of victory from the hardships, encouraging their fighting will and confidence in victory, and persevering in the guerrilla war behind enemy lines. In the rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform movements, through class and policy education in winter schools, farmers not only understood the principles of "who relies on whom to live" and what feudal exploitation is, breaking the superstitious "conscience" and "fate" viewpoints, but also learned the benefits of acting in accordance with the policies of the People's Government. Similarly, various tasks such as joining the army, supporting the front, and production, due to the enlightenment of the masses' awareness through winter school education, formalism and commandism in the work were greatly reduced. In counties such as Wuxiang and Licheng in the Taihang Mountains, where winter schools were better developed, cadres praised winter schools as the "locomotive of central work" from their personal experience! With the development of the victorious situation of the national revolution and the improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of people, the people's requirements for winter schools are gradually changing. They not only require winter schools to explain the current central work, because many tasks are already relatively familiar to them; but also more demand to increase the proportion of cultural learning. Last winter, in North and Northeast China, due to proper attention to strengthening the proportion of cultural education, many areas maintained winter schools and transformed them into year-round people's schools. "The general trend of the world" is also what people are most concerned about, especially with American imperialists frantically carrying out aggression, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army bravely fighting on the Korean front. We must meet the people's needs in order to combat the various rumors spread by American and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service claws. Therefore, it should be considered that cultural and current affairs education are the focus of this year's winter school education.

	How to combine current affairs and cultural education? Should they proceed simultaneously, each occupying half the time? Or should one study a section of culture and then a section of current affairs? This may be the first problem that must be solved to run this year's winter school well, but this needs to be determined based on the different work characteristics of each region and the different situations of current affairs development. Generally speaking, in old areas, due to the people's higher awareness, the content should pay more attention to strengthening literacy education and eliminating illiteracy. In new areas, in addition to meeting the cultural learning requirements of some of the masses, the main focus should be on combining policy education such as land reform and rent reduction. However, regardless of new or old areas, we should strengthen current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea. In addition to using the current affairs news in newspapers to promptly publicize the American imperialists' aggressive actions and ambitions, organizing the masses to conduct discussions, and arousing the broad masses of people's common hatred of the American imperialists, special attention should also be paid to systematically educating our Chinese people on why we hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism, so that the people can recognize and hate American imperialism like they recognize and hate the Japanese invaders. The time for conducting current affairs education should be determined based on the masses' ability to accept and the new developments in current affairs, and should not be mechanically divided; generally speaking, in new areas, the proportion of time for this type of education should be appropriately increased.

	How can winter schools be run well? What should be done if the masses are unwilling to attend winter schools? According to the experience of running winter schools in old areas over the years, the first thing to solve is the teacher problem. In the past, every year before the start of winter schools, people with a certain cultural and political level were selected and concentrated in the county for half a month or a month of study, and then returned to the village to serve as teachers, which was one of the ways to solve the teacher difficulty. Last year, in order to supplement the difficulty of low political and cultural level of teachers and insufficient teachers, Shanxi Province adopted the method of setting up "transmission stations," where cadres in charge from the county, district, or education department regularly went to a central location to gather winter school teachers from several villages (or selected cadres with more knowledge if there were no teachers) to regularly transmit current affairs and cultural education content. This method of learning and teaching on the spot has achieved very good results. In addition, when county and district cadres go to the countryside, they should give lectures in winter schools. Although this cannot be done regularly, it must be insisted upon and promoted, because this will further arouse everyone's attention to the work of winter schools. Secondly, it is very important to establish a special agency responsible for leading winter schools to solve problems such as teaching materials and funding. In the arrangement of work, we must be good at combining winter schools with the central work to prevent the isolation of completing the central tasks and the opposition of winter schools or the neglect of the role of winter schools. Third, when mobilizing the masses to enroll, we must adopt a voluntary persuasion method, and there should be no coercion. When the number of students is small, do not rush to order enrollment, but first run winter schools well among a few people to establish prestige, and gradually attract more people to participate. Years of experience have proven that as long as the teaching can help the masses, the masses will come to participate, and can help the school solve many specific difficulties. The form of winter schools can also be flexible and diverse according to the specific needs of the masses, such as combining with organizing the masses to produce self-salvation in disaster areas, and dividing into several "small winter schools" to transmit teaching in scattered mountain villages, without having to gather them together; the masses in the new areas have more concerns, and more patience is needed to carry out enrollment mobilization, gradually connecting with activists as the core, without demanding expansion.

	The task of this winter is busy, and the leadership in various places must be good at organizing forces, raising the work of winter schools to a sufficiently important position, and must remember Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's words: "All our undertakings are the undertakings of the people, and all rely on and are determined by the people's consciousness and initiative. Our responsibility is to use all effective and appropriate methods to enlighten the masses' consciousness." In the current great political movement in which the people of the world are universally launching resistance against American imperialists expanding the war, winter school is one of the effective methods to enlighten the masses' thinking and improve the masses' awareness. Neglecting this work in the ideological field of the masses and only shortsightedly busying oneself with the so-called "central tasks" will result in intangible losses to other work.

### 怎样办好今年的冬学？

    怎样办好今年的冬学？
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动已成为我全国人民当前中心斗争任务的今天，今年冬学运动的开展，较以往任何一年更具有重要的意义。
    冬学这一广泛而有效的群众教育组织，在老解放区的广大农村，有着深厚的影响与群众基础。农民们历年利用冬闲时间，参加冬学学习文化、政治、时事知识，讨论人民政府的各项政策与工作，以及自己生活上和生产上的问题，从而提高了文化水平与思想政治觉悟，并推进了各项工作。在抗日战争最艰苦的岁月，敌后广大农村，在冬学中普遍进行了持久抗战的教育，使广大农民从艰苦中预见胜利远景，鼓舞了斗争意志与必胜信心，坚持了敌后的游击战争。在减租减息、土地改革运动中，经过冬学的阶级与政策教育，农民们不仅懂得了“谁靠谁活”和什么是封建剥削等道理，打破了迷信性质的“良心”“命运”观点，而且知道了依据人民政府的政策办事的好处。他如参军、支前、生产等各项工作，由于冬学教育启发了群众的觉悟，工作中的形式主义与命令主义也因而大为减少。太行山武乡、黎城等冬学开展较好的县份，干部从切身体验中称誉冬学为“中心工作的火车头！”随着全国革命胜利形势的发展与广大人民政治觉悟的提高，人民对于冬学要求是在逐渐地改变着，他们不单单要求冬学能解释当前的中心工作，因为许多工作对他们已比较熟悉；而且更多地要求增加学习文化的分量。去年冬季华北东北地区由于适当地注意了加强文化教育的比重，有许多地区冬学从而坚持下来转为常年民校。“世界大势”亦是人民所最关心的，特别是美帝国主义者正在疯狂地进行侵略，而我中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正在朝鲜前线英勇奋战的今天。我们必须满足人民的这种要求，才能打击美蒋特务爪牙所散布的各种谣言，因此应该认为：文化与时事教育，是今年冬学教育的重点。
    时事、文化教育如何结合？是同时并进各占一半时间？还是学一段文化再学一段时事？这可能是办好今年冬学所必须首先解决的问题，但这是要依据各地不同工作特点，与时事发展的不同情况来确定的。一般说老区由于人民有较高的觉悟，在内容上应更多注意加强识字教育与消灭文盲的工作。在新区则除满足部分群众的文化学习要求外，主要是结合进行土改、减租等政策教育，但无论新区老区，均应加强抗美援朝的时事教育，除利用报纸的时事新闻，及时宣传美帝的侵略行动与野心，组织群众开展讨论，唤起广大人民对美帝的同仇敌忾外，还应特别注意有系统地进行我们中国人民为什么仇视、卑视与蔑视美帝国主义的教育，使人民象认识与仇恨日寇一样来认识与仇恨美帝国主义。进行时事教育的时间，是要依据群众的接受能力与时事发展的新的情况决定的，不应机械划分；一般地说，在新区，此种教育在时间的比重上应适当增加。
    怎样才能把冬学办好？遇到了群众不愿意上冬学的事情怎么办？根据老区历年办冬学的经验；首先要解决教员问题，过去各地每年在冬学开始前，选拔有一定文化政治水平的人，到县集中学习半月或一月，而后回村担任教员，是解决教员困难的办法之一，山西省去年为补充教员政治文化水平低与教员不足的困难，曾采取了设立“传授站”的办法，由县、区或教育部门负责干部，定期到一中心地点，集合数村冬学教员（无教员者则选拔较有知识的干部）定期传授时事文化教育内容，这种现学现教的办法，曾收到很好的效果。此外，县、区干部下乡时，应在冬学中讲课，这虽不能经常进行，但亦必须坚持推行，因为这样更能引起大家对于冬学工作的重视，其次是建立专门负责领导冬学的机构解决教材、经费等问题亦甚为重要。在工作的安排上，必须善于使冬学与中心工作相结合，以防止孤立完成中心任务与冬学对立或忽视冬学作用偏向。第三，在动员群众入学时，必须采取自愿说服的方法，不能有任何强迫。入学人数少时，不要急于命令入学，而应先在少数人中间办好冬学树立威信，逐渐吸引更多的人参加，历年经验证明，只要在教学中能给群众以帮助，群众是会来参加的，而且可以帮助学校解决许多具体困难。冬学的形式亦可根据群众具体要求灵活多样，如在灾荒地区必须结合组织群众生产自救，在分散的山庄则应分为若干“小冬学”传授教学，不必硬集合一起；新区群众顾虑较多，更需耐心进行入学动员，以积极分子为核心，逐渐串连，不可强求扩大。
    今冬工作任务繁忙，各地领导上必须善于组织力量，把冬学工作提到足够重要的地位，必须熟记刘少奇副主席的话：“我们的一切事业都是人民群众的事业，都依靠于、决定于人民群众的自觉与自动，我们的责任就是用一切有效适当的方法去启发群众自觉。”在当前全世界人民普遍掀起反抗美帝扩大战争的伟大的政治运动中，冬学是启发群众思想，提高群众觉悟的有效的方法之一。忽视这种群众思想领域的工作，只短视地忙乱于所谓“中心任务”，将会招致其他工作无形的损失。
