Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: New York dispatch: The representative of the People's Republic of China, Wu Xiuquan, delivered a speech at the United Nations Security Council on November 30th. The full text is as follows:

    Mr. Chairman: In my first speech, I already stated that I would only participate in the discussion of the accusation against the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan, and would not participate in the discussion of the so-called "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea." However, strangely, the U.S. representative, Mr. Austin, in his two speeches, did not directly answer the People's Republic of China's accusation against the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan. This proves that the reasons for the People's Republic of China's accusation are irrefutable. Instead, he attempted to divert everyone's attention to the so-called "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea" agenda, using MacArthur's illegal report as a basis, and raising a series of slanderous questions in a threatening tone. I want to tell Mr. Austin that this kind of threat cannot intimidate anyone.

    I do not participate in the discussion of the so-called "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea" because the truth of the Korean question is nothing more than the U.S. government's armed interference in Korea's internal affairs and serious damage to the security of the People's Republic of China. The U.S. government's usurpation of the United Nations' name is completely illegal. The United Nations Security Council's resolution on the Korean question on June 27th is fundamentally illegal because the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, two permanent member states, did not participate. Under these circumstances, I will never participate in the fundamentally absurd so-called "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea" discussion, nor is it necessary to answer the questions raised by Mr. Austin based on MacArthur's report.

    Since the U.S. government launched the war of aggression against Korea, from August 27th to November 25th, the U.S. armed forces that invaded Korea have violated our country's airspace 200 times, according to preliminary statistics, dispatching over 1,000 aircraft, destroying Chinese property, and killing and wounding Chinese people. I want to ask Mr. Austin, is this not aggression? Since June 27th, the U.S. Seventh Fleet has invaded our country's territorial waters of Taiwan to prevent the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China from exercising sovereignty over Taiwan. I want to ask Mr. Austin, is this not aggression? Since the end of World War II, the U.S. government has spent more than 6 billion U.S. dollars to help the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary clique launch an unprecedentedly cruel civil war, using American weapons to kill millions of Chinese people. I want to ask Mr. Austin, is this not interference in China's internal affairs?

    The era when imperialism was allowed to invade while the people were not allowed to resist is over. The Chinese people have full confidence in repelling all imperialists who dare to invade China.

    In order to maintain world peace and the solemnity of the United Nations Charter, I once again request the Security Council to accept the proposal of the People's Republic of China to stop the U.S. war of aggression and guarantee peace and security in Asia and the world.

    伍修权在安理会上的发言全文
    【新华社二日讯】纽约消息：中华人民共和国代表伍修权在十一月三十日联合国安全理事会上发言，全文如下：
    主席：在我第一次发言的时候，我已经申明我这一次出席安理会只参加控诉美国武装侵略台湾的讨论，而不参加所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”的讨论；但是，很奇怪的，美国代表奥斯汀先生在他的两次发言中，不正面来回答我中华人民共和国对于美国武装侵略台湾的控诉，这证明中华人民共和国控诉的理由是颠扑不破的，但他却企图把大家的注意力转移到所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”的议程上去，以麦克阿瑟的非法报告为根据，用威胁的口吻，提出了一连串诬蔑性的问题。我要告诉奥斯汀先生，这种威胁是吓不倒人的。
    我不参加所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”的讨论，理由是很清楚的。因为朝鲜问题的真相不是别的，正是美国政府武装干涉朝鲜的内政，并严重地破坏了中华人民共和国的安全。美国政府盗用联合国的名义是完全非法的。六月二十七日联合国安全理事会对于朝鲜问题的决议，由于没有中华人民共和国和苏联两常任理事国家参加，根本是非法的。在这种情况下，我决不参加那根本荒谬的所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”的讨论，也完全没有必要回答奥斯汀先生以麦克阿瑟报告为基础的所提出的问题。
    自从美国政府发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，从八月二十七日至十一月二十五日止，侵略朝鲜的美国武装力量已经侵犯我国领空，根据初步统计，已达二百次，共出动飞机一千架以上，毁坏中国财产，杀伤中国人民，我要问奥斯汀先生，这是不是侵略？自从六月二十七日以来，美国第七舰队即侵入我国台湾领海，以阻止我中华人民共和国中央人民政府对台湾行使主权，我要问奥斯汀先生，这是不是侵略？自从第二次世界战争结束以来，美国政府花费六十万万以上的美元，帮助中国国民党反动集团去发动空前残酷的内战，用美国武器残杀了几百万中国人民，我要问奥斯汀先生，这是不是干涉中国的内政？
    只准帝国主义侵略，不准人民反抗的时代已经过去了。中国人民完全有信心打退敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义者。
    为维持世界和平与联合国宪章的庄严，我再次向安理会要求接受中华人民共和国的建议，以制止美国的侵略战争，保证亚洲及世界的和平与安全。
