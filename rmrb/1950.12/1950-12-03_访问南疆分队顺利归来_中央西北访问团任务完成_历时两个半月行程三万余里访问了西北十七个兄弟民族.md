Those who arrived at the station to welcome them included Head of the Group Shen Junru, who had returned to Beijing earlier, Deputy Heads Sa Kongliao and Ma Yuhuai, and Director of the General Office of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Yang Jingren, and more than thirty others. After arriving in Xi'an on August 29th, the visiting group split into teams to visit areas inhabited by various nationalities in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces, lasting two and a half months, traveling more than 30,000 Li, and traversing the border regions of the Northwest to visit compatriots of seventeen nationalities. After completing their missions, all the teams have returned to Beijing one after another. The return of the first team led by Deputy Leader Peng Sike marks the end of the Central People's Government Northwest Nationalities Visiting Group's visitation work.

Furthermore, the first team visiting Southern Xinjiang traveled around the Tarim Great Gobi, visiting twenty-two important cities and villages in Southern Xinjiang, including Kashgar, Hotan, Aksu, and Shache, which are mostly inhabited by the Uyghur people. They also reached the westernmost part of the motherland, Wuha County on the Pamir Plateau on the Sino-Soviet border, and visited the Kyrgyz people living there, as well as the Mongolians in the Jing County nomadic area. Wherever the visiting group went, people of all nationalities held up the five-star national flag and cheered "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Long Live the People's Republic of China" in different languages. These historically significant and enthusiastic scenes have been captured by the film crew of the Beijing Film Studio.
