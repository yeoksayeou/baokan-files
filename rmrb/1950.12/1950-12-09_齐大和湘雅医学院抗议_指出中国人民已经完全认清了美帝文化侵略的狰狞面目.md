Qilu University in Jinan held a rally on the 4th to denounce American imperialist aggression. Professors and students of the entire university unanimously supported the speech of Wu Xiuquan, the representative of our country to the United Nations. At the same time, the meeting unanimously passed a declaration against the shameless slander made by Austin in the Security Council. The declaration pointed out that for more than 80 years, Qilu University's administration, economy, and other aspects have been under the extremely autocratic control of American imperialism. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the school moved to Chengdu, more than 20 professors respected by the students were dismissed without cause under the direction of American imperialism. The declaration finally emphasized that the Chinese people have now fully recognized the hideous features of American imperialism. All teachers and students of the university have firmly stood at the forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and are striving to eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression.

The teachers and students of Xiangya Medical College in Changsha were also greatly angered. Regarding Austin's arrogant slander, Ling Minyou, the president of the college, said: "This is the shameless expression of American imperialism." Professor Pan Shizheng, who was the first person sponsored by the Yale-in-China Association (Xiangya Medical College was founded by the association) to study at Yale University in the United States, said: "American imperialism simply does not welcome Chinese students to learn technology, but welcomes Chinese students to enter theological seminaries. I went to study technology, not as a believer, so they were very dissatisfied with me. From that time on, there was a rule that students sponsored by the Yale-in-China Association to study in the United States must be Christians. It can be seen that their establishment of medical colleges was not to help China develop its medical cause." Another professor at the college, Yi Jiannong, said: "In the past, what Xiangya Medical College taught and learned was a set of American things, and students invisibly became salesmen for American medicine and equipment, and were infected with the idea of ​​worshiping and being close to the United States."

    齐大和湘雅医学院抗议
    指出中国人民已经完全认清了美帝文化侵略的狰狞面目
    济南齐鲁大学师生在四日举行了控诉美帝国主义侵略大会。全校教授学生一致拥护我国出席联合国代表伍修权的发言。会上同时一致通过了反对奥斯汀在安理会上所发表的无耻谰言的宣言。该宣言指出：八十余年来，齐鲁大学的行政、经济等方面，都受到美帝国主义的极端专制的控制。抗战期间，学校迁往成都时，曾在美帝国主义的指使下，被无故地解聘了二十余位受学生尊敬的教授。宣言最后着重指出：现在，中国人民已经完全认清了美帝国主义的狰狞面目。全校师生已坚决地站在抗美援朝运动的最前线，为肃清美帝国主义的文化侵略而奋斗。
    长沙湘雅医学院师生也激起了极大的愤怒。对于奥斯汀的狂妄诬蔑，该院院长凌敏猷说：“这是美帝国主义厚颜无耻的表现。”被雅礼会（湘雅医学院是该会举办的）第一个保送去美国耶鲁大学学习的教授潘世?说：“美帝国主义根本就不欢迎中国学生学技术，而欢迎中国学生进神学院。我是去学技术的，又不是教徒，所以对我非常不满。从那个时候起，就有了雅礼会保送去美留学的学生必须是基督教徒的规定。可见他们办医学院并不是为了帮助中国发展医学事业。”该院另一教授易见农说：“过去湘雅医学院所教和所学的都是美国的一套，学生无形中做了美国医药、器械的推销员，染上了崇美、亲美的思想。”
