Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Delayed news: Gedan Living Buddha (Tibetan), a member of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and Vice Chairman of the Xikang Provincial People's Government, died tragically on August 22nd in Qamdo, poisoned by British imperialist agents while working for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Because the agent Ford burned the body to destroy the evidence after murdering Gedan Living Buddha, this news is only now fully confirmed. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee was deeply saddened upon hearing the news of Comrade Gedan's glorious sacrifice and immediately allocated 10 million yuan for funeral expenses, instructing the Xikang Provincial People's Government to handle Comrade Gedan's funeral arrangements. A memorial service was held by people from all walks of life in Chongqing on the 25th of last month.

The circumstances of Comrade Gedan's murder prove how insidious and cruel the imperialists are. Comrade Gedan set off from Baili Temple in Ganzi County, Xikang, for Tibet on July 10th this year. He arrived in Qamdo on the 24th and immediately began to publicize the policies of the Central People's Government to the masses and monks in the monasteries. He cited facts he had seen and heard to prove how the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army respect religious freedom, protect monasteries, respect the customs of ethnic minorities, and help the people improve their lives. He also publicized the Central People's Government's decision to maintain Tibet's existing political system and to resolve all reform matters through consultation with the Tibetan people and leaders. He also persuaded monasteries, chieftains, and militia not to be hostile to the People's Liberation Army, and that the Han and Tibetan nationalities must be closely united. Therefore, he won the support of the broad masses of Tibetan people and monasteries, but he was hated by the imperialists and their running dogs.

The British imperialist agent Ford and his accomplices monitored Gedan Living Buddha, preventing him from leaving Qamdo. On August 13th, they poisoned him with tea and then imprisoned him downstairs in Ford's residence, preventing his entourage from approaching. When his male and female disciples wanted to see him, they were also refused. After being poisoned, Gedan Living Buddha still wanted to send a telegram to his friends in Lhasa, asking them to find a way to help him achieve his desire to go to Lhasa, saying, "I will not regret dying, but I only ask to see the Dalai Living Buddha in Lhasa." This aroused even more fear and hatred from the imperialist agents, so they struck again, poisoning Gedan Living Buddha on August 21st. After being poisoned, Comrade Gedan suffered abdominal pain, headache, vomiting of yellow water, bleeding and pus from the nose, and numbness in the limbs. He passed away the next day (August 22nd). After his death, his whole body was black, and his skin would peel off to the touch. In order to eliminate the evidence of the crime, Ford burned Gedan's body and escorted his entourage to Lhasa.

When Comrade Gedan requested to enter Tibet, some government leaders and friends were concerned about his safety, but he said that the Tibetan people and the general religious and political leaders would not harm him, and only a few pro-British elements would use all means to stop and assassinate him. But he then said: "If something happens, it will be glorious. For the liberation of our nation, and because Commander-in-Chief Zhu has a relationship with me that is closer than brothers, I feel I have no personal concerns, and I only think that this work is a glorious and great task."

Vice Chairman Gedan, a Tibetan, was born in Ganzi, Xikang, in 1903 and was 47 years old this year. He was simple, fair, and honest, and extremely willing to help the poor masses. He also managed monastery property quite democratically, and was one of the Living Buddhas respected by the Tibetan people. In 1935, when the Red Army went north to resist Japan and passed through the Ganzi area, he actively participated in mobilizing the Tibetan people to give strong support to the Red Army. When the Boba government (i.e., the Tibetan People's Government) was established, Gedan served as vice chairman. Subsequently, when the Red Army transferred to Gansu, he and Vice Chairman Xia Gedao Deng and others hid and rescued the wounded and sick Red Army soldiers who remained in the Ganzi area. Because he accepted the teachings of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Chairman Liu Bocheng of the Chinese Communist Party, and because of his personal experience, he strengthened his trust and concern for the Chinese Communist Party. To this day, he still preserves the proclamation issued by the Red Army in the Kang area protecting monasteries. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he sent people to Qinghai to buy a "Battle Map of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi" and kept it. Last winter, before the liberation of the Southwest, he and Xia Gedao Deng and Bangda Duoji (both of whom are now members of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee) sent representatives to Beijing to present a banner to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to pay their respects.

He had great confidence in the victory of the Chinese revolution and often said to people: "The Red Army will definitely come back, and the Tibetan people will definitely be liberated."

After the People's Liberation Army liberated Kangding, Gedan convened a celebration meeting of more than 3,000 people in Ganzi and organized a delegation to Kangding to welcome the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the highway from Ya'an to Ganzi had not yet been completed, and the troops stationed in Ganzi often felt a shortage of grain. He mobilized and encouraged people from all walks of life in northern Xikang to lend a large amount of grain and firewood, and organized transportation to deliver supplies to the army. He told the Tibetan people: "We must not let our army go hungry."

After the liberation of the Southwest, Gedan served as a member of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, a member of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Committee, and Vice Chairman of the Xikang Provincial People's Government. This June, Vice Chairman Gedan was specially invited to participate in the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in Beijing. However, in order to devote himself to the peaceful liberation of the Tibetan people, he did not attend. Regardless of the hardships and dangers, he resolutely left Ganzi for Qamdo, saying to people before his departure: "In order to free the Tibetan people from the shackles of imperialism, it is right to brave all difficulties. When Tibet is liberated, it will not be too late to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu."

Now, Comrade Gedan's murder is a loss to the Tibetan people and even the entire Chinese people. But the liberation of Tibet is not far away, the murderer Ford has also been captured, Comrade Gedan's aspirations will soon be fulfilled, and the grievances will soon be redressed.

    为西藏和平解放毅然奔走
    格达活佛惨遭英帝特务毒害
    凶手已被俘获帝国主义阴险残忍罪证昭然
    西藏解放为期不远格达遗志不久即可完成
    【新华社三日讯】迟到消息：西南军政委员会委员、西康省人民政府副主席格达活佛（藏人），为了致力西藏的和平解放，于八月二十二日在昌都惨遭英帝国主义特务分子毒害身死。因特务分子福特在杀害格达活佛后，焚尸灭迹，故这一消息现在方完全证实。西南军政委员会闻悉格达委员光荣牺牲的噩耗后，甚为哀悼，即拨治丧费一千万元，责成西康人民政府办理格达委员身后事宜。重庆市各界已于上月二十五日举行追悼会。
    格达委员的遇害经过，证明帝国主义者是如何阴险残忍。格达委员系于本年七月十日自西康甘孜县白利寺出发赴西藏。二十四日到达昌都，即对群众和喇嘛寺僧侣宣传中央人民政府政策，并列举所见所闻的事实，证明人民政府和人民解放军如何尊重宗教自由，保护喇嘛庙，尊重少数民族风俗习惯，帮助人民改善生活等；也宣传了中央人民政府维持西藏现行各种政治制度，与一切改革事宜由西藏人民及领导人协商解决的决策；并劝说喇嘛寺及头人、民兵不与人民解放军为敌，汉藏民族必须紧密团结。因此，深得广大藏族人民及喇嘛寺之拥护。但却遭到了帝国主义及其走狗的忌恨。
    英帝国主义的特务福特和他的帮凶将格达活佛监视，不准他离开昌都，并于八月十三日给他毒茶吃了后，将他软禁在福特住室的楼下，不准随行人员接近。他的男女弟子们要去看他，也遭拒绝。格达活佛在受毒之后，仍要打电报给拉萨的朋友，请他们设法帮助达到去拉萨的志愿，并说：“我死也不悔，但求到拉萨一见达赖活佛。”这更引起了帝国主义特务分子们的恐惧和忌恨，于是他们再下毒手，于八月二十一日又给格达活佛吃毒药。格达委员中毒后，即腹疼，头疼，口吐黄水，鼻孔流血流脓，四肢麻木，于次日（八月二十二日）圆寂。死后全身乌黑，皮肤触手即行脱落。福特为了消灭犯罪证据，将格达尸体焚毁，并将其随行人员押送拉萨。
    格达委员要求进藏时，若干政府首长和友人曾顾虑到他的安全，但他说西藏人民和一般政教领袖是不会害他的，只有少数亲英分子会利用一切手段来阻止和暗害他。但他接着说：“万一出事也是光荣的。为了本民族的解放事业，又有朱总司令和我比兄弟还亲的关系，所以我觉得个人没有什么顾虑，只想到这个工作是光荣而伟大的任务。”
    格达副主席，藏族人，一九○三年生于西康甘孜，今年四十七岁，为人俭朴、公正、廉明，极喜帮助贫苦群众，管理寺产亦颇民主，为藏族人民所尊敬的活佛之一。一九三五年红军北上抗日，经过甘孜地区，他曾参与积极发动藏族人民，给红军有力的支援。博巴政府（即藏族人民政府）成立，格达任副主席，随后红军向甘肃转移，他和夏格刀登副主席等，隐蔽和救助留在甘孜地区的红军伤病员。由于他接受了中国共产党朱总司令和刘伯承主席的教导，由于他亲身体验的结果，增强了他对中国共产党的信任和关心。当年红军在康区发布的保护喇嘛寺的布告，至今他仍保存着。抗日战争时期，他曾派人到青海买了一张“八路军山西奋战图”，保存起来。去年冬天，西南解放前，他和夏格刀登、邦达多吉（二人现均为西南军政委员会委员）派代表到北京来，向毛主席和朱总司令献旗致敬。
    他对中国革命的胜利具有很大的信心，经常对人说：“红军一定会回来，藏族人民一定会翻身的。”
    人民解放军解放康定后，格达在甘孜召开了一个三千余人的庆祝大会，并组织代表团赴康定欢迎解放军。当时雅安到甘孜的公路尚未修通，进驻甘孜的部队常感粮食缺乏，他动员与鼓励康北各界人民借出大批粮食柴草，并组织驮运，为军队运送物资。他告诉藏族人民说：“我们决不能让自己的军队饿肚子。”
    格达在西南解放后，即曾任西南军政委员会委员，西南民族事务委员会委员，西康省人民政府副主席等职。今年六月在北京召开的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二次会议，格达副主席曾被特别邀请参加。但他为了致力于西藏人民的和平解放，没有出席。他不计艰险，毅然离开甘孜前往昌都，临行时对人说：“为了使藏族人民脱离帝国主义羁绊，冒万难也是应该的，等到西藏解放了，再到北京去见毛主席、朱总司令也不为迟。”
    现格达委员的遇害，是西藏人民乃至全中国人民的损失。但西藏解放已不在远，凶手福特也已被俘获，格达委员的志愿不久即可完成，怨仇不久也可申雪。
