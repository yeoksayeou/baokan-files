Several Issues to Note in This Year's Winter Agricultural Production
    Du Bo

This year's winter rural production work is of particular importance. Striving for a greater agricultural harvest next year and ensuring a sufficient supply of grain and certain industrial raw materials nationwide are crucial conditions for supporting the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homeland.

This year's national agricultural harvest played an important role in achieving the initial improvement of the national financial and economic situation. This harvest was inseparable from the achievements of last year's widespread mass winter production campaign. Winter production is the foundation for the following year's agricultural production. Neglecting winter production work will inevitably affect the following year's harvest.

This year's winter production work, being situated in an environment where American imperialism has launched an invasion against Korea and China, should not only pay attention to various preparations for next year's agricultural production, but also focus on explaining the following three issues to rural cadres and farmers:

First, it is essential to recognize the true nature of the current situation and stabilize production morale. Due to the American imperialists launching the war of aggression against Korea, as well as the rumors spread by special agents, bandits, reactionary secret societies, and reactionary landlords, some rural cadres and farmers have developed some confused ideas. In the old liberated areas, the main fear is that the fruits of land reform cannot be preserved, and that the peaceful life that has begun to become prosperous cannot be maintained, that is, the fear of a return to the old order. In the vast new areas, the masses mainly fear that land reform or rent reduction and deposit refunds will not be achieved. These concerns have affected the production morale of some farmers. This kind of thinking is mainly caused by the erroneous thought of fearing America. These people mistakenly believe that American imperialism is very powerful, and if the United States launches a third world war, if it drops atomic bombs, then we cannot resist, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and landlords will return to rule the peasants. This erroneous psychology must be eliminated. Therefore, this winter, it is necessary to carry out in-depth current affairs education in rural areas. Focus on eliminating the erroneous psychology of fearing America and establishing confidence in the inevitable victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. Only when the concerns of the peasant masses are dispelled can they fully develop their enthusiasm for production.

Second, it is necessary to overcome the complacency arising from this year's bumper harvest. This sentiment is relatively widespread among some rural cadres and some farmers. If cadres have this sentiment, they will inevitably relax their leadership over production. If farmers are complacent, they will not work hard in production and will easily indulge in excessive eating and drinking, wasting the fruits of production. In some places, production work in this year's autumn harvest was already relaxed due to complacency, resulting in some unnecessary losses. This is an important lesson that should be heeded. In fact, next year's agricultural production tasks are even heavier than this year's. First, grain and cotton must have greater increases in production than this year. Increased production of grain and cotton is the main key to stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihood supplies next year. Rural cadres and farmers in various places should make more arduous efforts on the basis of this year's bumper harvest to strive for greater victories. Waste of agricultural products should be resolutely opposed. Thrift should be promoted, and the concept of "a small stream flows steadily" and careful calculation should be established. Farmers' surplus funds should be invested in reproduction to strive for a more prosperous life.

Third, it is necessary to do a particularly good job in supply and marketing work. This is the most important issue concerning the direct economic interests of farmers. The key lies in finding outlets for surplus grain and farmers' sideline products in rural areas, and in ensuring that the living and production materials needed by farmers are obtained in a timely manner. This should be the case in normal times, and it should be even more so today, when resisting America and aiding Korea has become the most central struggle task of the people of the whole country. From last year to this year, the state has provided relatively extensive economic assistance to farmers. Last winter and this spring, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the People's Government, carried out massive water conservancy work in flood-stricken areas across the country. After this year's summer harvest, state-owned trading agencies implemented large-scale purchases of agricultural and sideline products to narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural product prices and appropriately protect the interests of farmers. Now, the scale of this work cannot but be temporarily reduced compared to the original plan. In such a situation, only by strengthening supply and marketing work, that is, strengthening commercial work, can farmers obtain new benefits from selling surplus agricultural and sideline products, and from this aspect enhance the purchasing power of farmers. Therefore, in the future, commercial activities must be carried out in both domestic and foreign markets. All state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private businesses should divide labor and cooperate in a planned manner under the leadership of state-owned commerce to carry out material exchanges between domestic and foreign countries and between urban and rural areas. The most critical link in supply and marketing work is to support and develop rural supply and marketing cooperatives. State-owned trading agencies should enthusiastically help the development of rural supply and marketing cooperatives. The enthusiasm of legitimate private merchants should also be fully utilized. Effective supply and marketing work can stimulate the peasant masses to increase production, and in winter, it can particularly stimulate rural sideline production. Of course, supply and marketing work should avoid blindness as much as possible. State-owned trading agencies, cooperatives, and local product merchants in various places should conduct research on supply and marketing issues in advance under leadership, and adopt methods such as signing contracts as much as possible to gradually combine sideline production with market needs, so as to avoid separation of production and sales and causing losses.

In order to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homeland, and for the Chinese peasants to have a better life, this year's winter production should be done better than last year.

    今年冬季农业生产应注意的几个问题
    杜波
    今年冬季农村生产工作，有特别重要的意义。因为争取明年农业更大丰收，保证全国粮食与若干工业原料的充分供应，是支持抗美援朝保家卫国运动的重要条件之一。
    今年全国农业丰收，对于争取今年国家财政经济初步好转，曾起了重要作用。而这次丰收，是和去年广泛的群众性的冬季生产运动的成就分不开的。因为冬季生产，是第二年农业生产的基础。忽视了冬季生产工作，必然影响第二年的收获。
    今年冬季生产工作，由于处在美帝国主义对朝鲜和中国发动了侵略的环境中，除应注意明年农业生产上的各种准备外，在农村干部和农民思想中主要应注重说明下述三个问题。
    首先一个问题，是认清时局真象，安定生产情绪。由于美帝发动侵朝战争，以及特务匪徒们、反动会门和反动地主乘机造谣的结果，部分农村干部和农民群众产生了若干混乱思想。在老解放区，主要怕土地改革的果实保不住，怕开始富裕的和平生活保不住，就是说，怕再变大；在广大新区，群众主要怕搞不成土地改革或减租退押。这些思想顾虑，使部分农民的生产情绪受到影响。这种思想情绪，主要是恐美的错误思想在作怪。这些人误以为美帝国主义十分强大，如果美国发动第三次世界大战，如果打原子弹，那么我们就不能抵抗，国民党反动派和地主们重新又会随着美帝国主义回来统治农民。这种错误心理，是必须肃清的。因此，今年冬季，应在农村中深入地进行时事教育。着重肃清恐美的错误心理，树立抗美援朝必胜的信心。只有农民群众的顾虑解除了，他们才能充分发挥生产积极性。
    第二，是必须克服因今年丰收而产生的自满情绪。这种情绪，在部分农村干部中与部分农民群众中，均比较广泛地存在。干部有了这种情绪，必然放松对生产的领导，农民如果自满，就不会努力生产，而且很容易大吃大喝，浪费生产成果。若干地方在今年秋季生产工作上，已经因自满而放松了生产工作，因而造成了若干不应有的损失。这是应当警惕的重要教训。事实上，明年农业生产任务，比今年还要重，首先是粮食和棉花均必须比今年有更大的增产。因为粮棉增产是明年稳定物价、保证民生供给的主要关键。各地农村干部和农民群众应当在今年丰收的基础之上，作更艰巨的努力，以争取更大的胜利。对于浪费生产品的现象，应坚决地加以反对，应提倡节约，树立细水长流，精打细算的观点。农民剩余的资金，应使之投入再生产，为更富裕的生活而努力。
    第三，是要特别作好供销工作。这是对于农民切身经济利益中最重要的问题。其关键在于使农村中剩余粮食及农民副业产品能找到出路；而农民所需要的生活资料与生产资料又能及时得到。这在平时就应当如此，在抗美援朝已成为全国人民最中心的斗争任务的今天，更应当如此。从去年到今年，国家对于农民曾进行了比较广泛的经济扶助。去冬今春，中国人民曾在人民政府领导下，在全国水患地区，进行了巨大的水利工作。今年夏收以后，国营贸易机关曾对于农产品及农副产品实行了大规模的收购，以缩小工农业产品价格的剪刀差，适当地保护农民的利益。现在，这种工作规模不能不暂时地比原有计划缩小。在这样的情形下，只有加强供销工作，也就是加强商业工作，才能使农民从推销剩余农产及农副产品中得到新的利益，从这一个方面来增强农民的购买力。因此，今后，在国内外市场上均必须开展商业活动，一切国营商业、合作社与私人商业应有计划地在国营商业领导下分工合作，开展国内外与城乡间之物资交流。供销工作中最关重要的环节，则是扶助与发展农村供销合作社。国营贸易机关应热忱地帮助农村供销合作社的发展。对于正当私商，亦应充分发挥其积极性。有效的供销工作，可以刺激农民群众增加生产，在冬季，特别能刺激农村副业生产。当然，供销工作应尽量避免盲目性。各地国营贸易机关、合作社及土产商人应有领导地对供销问题事先进行研究，并尽可能采取订立合同等方法，逐步把副业生产与市场需要结合起来。以免产销脱节，造成损失。
    为了抗美援朝保家卫国，为了中国农民有更好的生活，今年冬季生产，应当比去年作得更好。
