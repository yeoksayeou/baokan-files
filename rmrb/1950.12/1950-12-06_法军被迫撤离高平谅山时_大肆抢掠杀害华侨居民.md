Xinhua News Agency, 4th: When the French troops invading Vietnam retreated from Cao Bang, Dong Dang and Lang Son in northern Vietnam, they looted and killed local overseas Chinese residents. According to accusations from repatriated overseas Chinese regarding the crimes of French imperialism: when the French troops withdrew from Cao Bang, many overseas Chinese were forced to retreat with them. The French troops took the opportunity to loot the property of the overseas Chinese on a large scale, and some women were raped. The overseas Chinese residing in Na Cen were completely looted by the French troops. On the evening of October 17, before the French troops withdrew from Dong Dang, they arrested more than 20 young overseas Chinese and sent them to Lang Son to be subjected to electric shocks. These young people were blinded by the torture of electric shocks. Six of them were sent to Hanoi, and one young man died under torture. When the French troops withdrew from Lang Son, they were in a hurry and did not have time to loot, so they carried out large-scale destruction. Two overseas Chinese-owned hotels were completely destroyed by the French troops. One overseas Chinese who was forced onto a car was beaten to death by the French troops on the spot.

    法军被迫撤离高平谅山时
    大肆抢掠杀害华侨居民
    【新华社四日讯】侵略越南的法国军队在自越北的高平、同登、谅山溃退时，曾大肆抢掠烧杀当地华侨居民。据归国华侨控诉法帝国主义罪行称：法军撤退高平时，有很多华侨被强迫随其撤退。法军趁机大肆劫掠华侨财产，有的妇女遭到奸污。居住那岑的华侨被法军抢劫一空。十月十七日晚法军撤退同登前，抓走了二十多个华侨青年，送到谅山施以电刑。这些青年因受电刑摧残，眼睛失明。其中有六人被送到河内，有一个青年受刑身死。法军在撤退谅山时，因时间紧迫来不及抢劫，遂大肆破坏。有两家华侨酒店被法军全部捣毁。有一个被强拖上汽车的华侨，当场被法军打死。
