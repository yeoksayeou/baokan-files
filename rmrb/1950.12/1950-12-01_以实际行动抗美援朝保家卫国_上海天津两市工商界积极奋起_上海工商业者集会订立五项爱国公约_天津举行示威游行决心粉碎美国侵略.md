    [Reported by this newspaper] The industrialists and businessmen of Shanghai and Tianjin are actively mobilizing to participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation. The industrial and commercial circles in both cities have recently established five patriotic pledges and four guarantees respectively, expressing their willingness to contribute all their strength to support the just cause of the people across the country in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and calling on industrialists and businessmen nationwide to abide by the government's policies and laws, step up production, and strengthen the country's economic power.

    More than 1,300 representatives from Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles held a mobilization meeting on November 27 to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation. Hu Juewen, Chairman of the meeting, first pointed out the great significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation, followed by Xia Yan, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, who reported on the current international situation. Shen Han, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing the million workers of Shanghai, warmly supported the patriotic actions of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. At the meeting, representatives from the industrial and commercial circles, including Liu Hongsheng, Wu Yun Chu, and Mao Xiaoyin, spoke successively, unanimously agreeing that the industrial and commercial circles should unite, step up production, abide by the government's policies and laws, and take practical action to smash U.S. imperialism's aggression, in order to avoid once again suffering the deep persecution of Chinese national industry and commerce by imperialism for more than a century. The meeting passed the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles' Patriotic Pledge to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation with extremely enthusiastic sentiments, solemnly declaring to jointly abide by:

    1. Contribute all our strength to support the volunteer forces resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation.
    2. Stand fast at our posts, step up production, facilitate the exchange of materials, and ensure the sufficient supply of military and civilian materials.
    3. Abide by the government's policies and laws, ensure stable prices, do not hoard goods for speculation, do not engage in speculation, do not default on taxes, and do not evade taxes.
    4. Strengthen current affairs learning, recognize friends and enemies, and do not listen to the absurd rumors of U.S. imperialism and bandits and special agents.
    5. Protect production equipment and warehouse materials, and strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents. More than 500 people from the industrial and commercial circles signed the patriotic pledge on the spot. The meeting also passed a telegram to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression.

    Since the U.S. imperialists expanded their war of aggression against Korea, the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin have deeply felt that the rapid recovery and development they have achieved after liberation under the correct policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests by the People's Government is now threatened by the aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism. More than 25,000 representatives from 143 industries, representing more than 40,000 industrial and commercial households in the city, held a grand demonstration and parade on November 30 to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the nation. At the beginning of the parade, Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported the significance of the parade. The parade rally passed a tribute telegram to Chairman Mao in a loud voice, expressing its determination to resolutely implement the four guarantees for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in order to smash the U.S. imperialists' crazy aggression. The meeting also telegraphed Wu Xiuquan, our representative to the United Nations Security Council, supporting his speech accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan and his three proposals. The parade, which stretched for several miles, held high the bright red banner of "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation" and the giant statue of Chairman Mao. In the mighty demonstration ranks, the voices of "Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against Korea!" and "Aid Korea to Defend Ourselves!" resounded in unison. Countless banners were written with Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles' four guarantees for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea: 1. Contribute all our strength to support voluntary actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; 2. Stand fast at our work posts and ensure active operation and good production; 3. Resolutely support government policies and laws, ensure stable prices, and oppose hoarding, speculation, and profiteering; 4. Strengthen current affairs learning, recognize the current situation, expand propaganda, unify thinking, recognize friends and enemies, and do not allow reactionary elements to spread rumors. When the parade passed in front of the reviewing stand in Central Park, Tianjin Mayor Huang Jing and others applauded the demonstrators warmly. Tens of thousands of citizens crowded on both sides, praising the patriotic and righteous actions of the industrial and commercial circles. The parade was extremely excited to receive a telegram from the enlarged meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association, expressing respect and warm congratulations. Letters of condolence to the Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteers and comfort goods were also donated from the hands of the demonstrators. The awakened industrialists and businessmen of Tianjin have realized that there can be no illusions about U.S. imperialism, and only by smashing the enemy's aggressive ambitions can we achieve a peaceful and developing future.

    【本报讯】上海、天津两大城市工商业者，正积极动员起来参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。两地工商界近日分别订立了五项爱国公约和四项保证，表示愿贡献一切力量，支持全国人民抗美援朝的义举，并号召全国工商业者一致遵守政府的政策法令，加紧生产，充实国家的经济力量。
    上海市一千三百余工商界代表，于十一月二十七日举行了抗美援朝保家卫国动员大会。大会主席胡厥文首先指出抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大意义，即由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会上海分会副主席夏衍报告目前国际形势。上海总工会副主席沈涵代表全上海百万工人，热烈拥护上海工商界的爱国行动。会上，工商界代表刘鸿生、吴蕴初、毛啸吟等相继发言，一致认为工商界应当团结起来，加紧生产，遵守政府的政策法令，用实际行动来粉碎美帝的侵略，才能避免重行遭受百余年来帝国主义对中国民族工商业的深重迫害。大会以极为热烈的情绪通过了上海工商界抗美援朝保家卫国爱国公约，郑重宣言决共同遵守：
    一、贡献一切力量，支援抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿部队。
    二、坚守岗位，加紧生产，沟通物资交流，保证军需民用物资的充分供应。
    三、遵守政府的政策法令，保证稳定物价，不囤积居奇，不投机取巧，不欠税，不逃税。
    四、加强时事学习，认清敌友，不听信美帝和匪特的荒谬谣言。
    五、保护生产设备和仓库物资，严防匪特破坏。五百余位工商界人士当场在爱国公约上签了名。大会并通过了致中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的通电。
    天津市工商界自美帝扩大侵略朝鲜战争以来，深切感受到解放后在人民政府公私兼顾的正确政策下很快得到的恢复和发展，已受到美帝发动侵略战争的威胁。全市四万余工商业户的一百四十三个行业的代表二万五千余人，于十一月三十日轰轰烈烈地举行了抗美援朝保家卫国示威大游行。游行开始时，由工商联李烛尘主委报告游行意义后，游行大会以洪亮的声音通过了向毛主席致敬电，表示为了粉碎美帝疯狂的侵略，将坚决执行抗美援朝四项保证。大会并致电我出席联合国安理会代表伍修权，拥护他控诉美国武装侵略台湾的发言与三项建议。长达数里的游行队伍，高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的鲜红旗帜，和毛主席的巨像。壮大的示威行列中，一致发出：“反对美帝侵略朝鲜！”“援助朝鲜保卫自己！”的吼声。无数的标帜上都写着天津市工商界抗美援朝的四项保证：一、贡献一切力量，支援抗美援朝的志愿行动；二、坚守工作岗位，保证积极经营，搞好生产；三、坚决支持政府政策法令，保证稳定物价，反对囤积居奇，投机倒把；四、加强时事学习，认请目前形势，扩大宣传，统一思想，认清敌友，不叫反动分子造谣。游行队伍经过中心公园检阅台前时，天津市市长黄敬等向示威游行者鼓起了热烈的掌声。数以万计的市民拥挤两旁，纷纷赞美着工商界的爱国义举。游行队伍极为兴奋的收到了民主建国总会扩大会议全体代表表示敬意和热烈祝贺的电文。慰问朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿部队的信件和慰劳品，亦自示威游行者的手中纷纷捐献出来。觉悟了的天津市工商业者，已认识到对美帝不能存有任何的幻想，只有粉碎敌人侵略的野心，才能得到和平发展的前途。
