Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 3rd: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of December 1st to begin discussing the Kuomintang's slanderous accusation case on the agenda: "The Soviet Union violates the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945, and the United Nations Charter, threatening China's political independence and territorial integrity and peace in the Far East."

As everyone knows, this slanderous accusation case was discussed at the Fourth General Assembly session last year. At that time, the issue was submitted to the so-called "Interim Committee" for further review and study. However, the "Interim Committee" did not take any decision on this libel case during the year.

Due to the insistence of the Kuomintang elements and the support of the U.S. delegation, the Kuomintang slanderous accusation case was included on the agenda of the Fifth General Assembly session. The discussion of this issue in the Political Committee proved that the Kuomintang's slanderous accusation case was completely untenable and groundless, and was only included on the General Assembly agenda as a pretext for slandering the Soviet Union.

When the discussion in the Political Committee was about to end, the Kuomintang elements, seeing that their proposal had failed, withdrew their proposal.

However, the Political Committee passed the proposal of the Syrian delegation with a majority vote. This proposal suggested that the "Interim Committee" continue to "study the issue." The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and twelve other delegations - including Australia, the Union of South Africa, Canada, and Sweden - voted against this proposal. In addition, several delegations, including France, Pakistan, and the Netherlands, abstained. The Political Committee also passed the proposal of the El Salvador delegation, which proposed: "To draw the attention of all countries to the necessity of complying in good conscience with the recommendations in the General Assembly resolutions," "with the aim of promoting the stability of international relations in the Far East." The representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against this proposal, and fourteen delegations, including India, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Sweden, the Union of South Africa, and other countries, abstained.

Before the General Assembly plenary session voted on these two proposals, many delegations spoke on the reasons for their votes. Later, Soviet representative Malik spoke.

Malik said: The Soviet delegation opposes discussing the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations within the United Nations, and also opposes transferring this issue to the so-called "Interim Committee," which was an illegal organization of the United Nations as early as last year. The Soviet representative also recalled that when the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations were discussed in the Political Committee, many delegations, including those of Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries, firmly opposed wasting energy discussing the instigated Kuomintang slanderous accusations. Malik emphasized that a shady conspiracy is being carried out around the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations. The goal of this conspiracy is to keep this item on the UN agenda regardless of logic and in violation of basic standards of political morality. The Soviet representative said: The slanderers and their instigators are attempting to complicate the relations between the United Nations and the Soviet Union by unsightly means. The Soviet delegation strongly protested the United Nations' continued discussion of this dirty, provocative, and harmful Kuomintang slanderous accusation.

Czechoslovakian representative Piseck asked the representatives to pay attention: the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations are the act of a small group of bought-over Kuomintang guys, and are a new anti-Soviet provocation and a malicious attack on the friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people. Piseck said that his delegation opposes discussing the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations in the United Nations and will vote against the two motions passed by the Political Committee, which are to keep this fabricated case of the Kuomintang on the agenda of the United Nations organs.

Syrian representative El-Khouri said that his delegation proposed this proposal in the hope of "dealing with this issue in a legitimate way." The Syrian delegation did not consider the substance of the Kuomintang's slanderous accusation case, because there is no fact that needs such discussion.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that the Kuomintang's slanderous accusation case was proposed by the remnants of the Kuomintang clique. He illegally occupies a seat in the United Nations, and with the assistance of the U.S. representative, is attempting to artificially keep his defamatory slander on the UN agenda. The Polish representative said that his delegation would vote against the two proposals passed by the majority of the Political Committee.

U.S. representative Dulles spoke in favor of the proposals under discussion, although he said that the U.S. delegation considered these proposals to be "insufficient." The representative of the Kuomintang clique then spoke, attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China as usual.

Ukrainian Republic representative Baranovksy strongly opposed keeping the Kuomintang's slanderous accusation case on the UN agenda. He said that the author of the slanderous accusation case is a private representative of the anti-people Kuomintang clique, who does not represent the will of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. Baranovksy also emphasized that the U.S. representative's efforts to keep the Kuomintang's libel case on the General Assembly agenda were in the hope of diverting public opinion from the failure of the U.S. government's China policy, and justifying Chiang Kai-shek's shameful bankruptcy with the so-called Soviet intervention.

Belarusian representative Kiselev exposed the slanderous remarks of U.S. representative Dulles and the Kuomintang elements, and said that his delegation resolutely rejects keeping the Kuomintang's libel case on the UN agenda.

After the representatives of El Salvador, Egypt, Turkey, and other countries spoke, a vote was held. Thirty-five votes were in favor of the Syrian delegation's proposal, and seventeen votes were against (including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain, the Union of South Africa, Denmark, Australia, etc.). Seven delegations abstained (including France, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.).

The UN General Assembly Discusses the Issue of "Helping to Rebuild Korea"
The Soviet Union Opposes Any Actions that Interfere in Korea's Internal Affairs

Subsequently, the General Assembly considered the question of coordination between the United Nations Organization and the specialized agencies, and adopted the joint proposal of the Second, Third, and Fifth Committees on this question.

After that, it considered the plan to help rebuild Korea, and the Second and Third Joint Committees submitted a report on this issue. This committee put forward two proposals. The first proposal stipulates that the United Nations establish an agency for the reconstruction of Korea, led by the United Nations Director, which should be responsible for implementing the economic aid program for Korea, which according to the proposal should be formulated by the United Nations Organization. The second proposal concerns the financial measures for implementing the aid program for the reconstruction of Korea.

Soviet representative Arutiunian, in explaining the reasons for the vote, specifically pointed out that the preamble to the first proposal was based on incorrect statements. That is, the so-called aggression in Korea was carried out by the armed forces of North Korea. In fact, what happened in Korea was the American aggression against the Korean people. Arutiunian pointed out that when the UN General Assembly discussed the question of Korean independence, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, cited irrefutable facts and documents sufficient to prove the American aggression against Korea and the American armed forces' intervention in Korea. American intervention in Korea brought infinite disasters to the Korean people. The Soviet representative asked everyone to pay attention to the fact that the U.S. Air Force carried out barbaric and insane bombings of Korean residential areas. Arutiunian said: Given this, how can it be said that the destructive actions in Korea are not the result of American aggression, but something else - North Korea? Such an erroneous statement on the issue cannot be tolerated in the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, Arutiunian proposed an amendment, suggesting that such a statement be deleted from the preamble of the proposal, that the aggression in Korea was initiated by the armed forces of North Korea. The Soviet representative then emphasized that the aid given to Korea should not be used for any political purpose unrelated to the interests of the Korean people, and should not serve as a means of foreign economic and political interference in Korea's internal affairs, and should not be accompanied by any... political actions. The Soviet representative declared that the plan for aid to the reconstruction of Korea should be formulated with the participation of representatives of the Korean people. The entire plan for aid to Korea should also be carried out by the United Nations Organization with the active participation of representatives of the Korean people. The Soviet representative declared that the proposal includes clauses that allow foreigners to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea and grant the director extremely broad powers; he proposed an amendment to the proposal to correct these shortcomings.

The representatives of Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Ukraine also successively criticized the proposals under consideration. They all supported the amendments of the Soviet delegation. U.S. representative Sparkman spoke against the Soviet delegation's amendments, repeating the old slanders about the Korean incident.

Subsequently, a vote was held. The Soviet delegation's amendment was rejected. The representatives of five countries voted in favor of the amendment (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia). The first proposal was passed by a majority of fifty-one votes. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstained. The second proposal was also passed by a majority.

At the end of the daytime meeting, the General Assembly reviewed several minor technical issues, and then the meeting adjourned.

### 联合国大会讨论国民党残匪诬告案  苏捷等十二国代表一致予以痛斥  美国又操纵多数将诬告案交“临时委员会”

    联合国大会讨论国民党残匪诬告案
    苏捷等十二国代表一致予以痛斥
    美国又操纵多数将诬告案交“临时委员会”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约三日电：联合国大会于十二月一日下午举行全体会议，开始讨论议程上的国民党诬告案：“苏联违反一九四五年八月十四日中苏友好同盟条约及联合国宪章，威胁中国政治独立与领土完整及远东和平。”
    大家都知道，这个诬告案去年曾经在第四次大会会议上讨论过。当时把这个问题提交所谓“临时委员会”作进一步的审议和研究，然而“临时委员会”在这一年中对这个诽谤案没有采取任何决定。
    由于国民党分子的坚持和美国代表团的支持，国民党诬告案列入了第五次大会会议的议程。在政治委员会中对这个问题的讨论，证明了国民党诬告案完全不能成立而且没有根据，只是作为诽谤苏联的口实才列入大会议程的。
    政治委员会的讨论将结束时，国民党分子见到他提出的建议已经失败，撤回了他的提案。
    然而政治委员会以多数通过了叙利亚代表团的提案，这提案建议“临时委员会”继续“研究这个问题”。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及其他十二国代表团——包括澳大利亚，南非联邦，加拿大，瑞典等投票反对这个提案。此外，包括法国、巴基斯坦、荷兰等国在内的若干个代表团弃权。政治委员会也通过萨尔瓦多代表团的提案，提案建议：“提请所有国家注意本其良知遵守大会决议案中的建议的必要性”，“其目的在于增进远东国际关系的稳定”。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克各国代表投票反对这个提案，包括印度、荷兰、巴基斯坦、瑞典、南非联邦、及其他国家在内的十四个代表团弃权。
    在大会全体会议对这两个提案进行表决以前，许多代表团就他们投票的理由发言。后来苏联代表马立克发言。
    马立克说：苏联代表团反对在联合国范围内讨论国民党的诬告，也反对把这个问题转移到所谓“临时委员会”，早在去年，该机构就是联合国的非法机构。苏联代表同时也追述说：当国民党的诬告在政治委员会讨论时，许多的代表团，其中包括英国、加拿大、澳大利亚与其他国家的代表团曾坚决地反对浪费精力讨论受人唆使的国民党诬告。马立克强调说：围绕着国民党的诬告正在进行着见不得人的阴谋，这个阴谋的目标是不顾逻辑，违反政治道德的基本标准，而硬要把这一项议程保持在联大的议程上。苏联代表说：造谣的人与他们的教唆者企图以不漂亮的手段使联合国与苏联的关系复杂化。苏联代表团极力抗议联合国继续讨论这个肮脏的挑拨的对联合国有害的国民党诬告。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表彼塞克请代表们注意：国民党的诬告是一小撮被收买的国民党家伙们所干的勾当，并且是新的反苏挑拨行为，是对苏联与中国人民的友谊与同盟的恶毒的攻击。彼塞克说：他的代表团反对在联合国中讨论国民党的诬告，并将投票反对政治委员会所通过的两项议案，这些议案是要把国民党这一虚构捏造的案件保持在联合国机关的议程上。
    叙利亚代表埃尔·古里说：他的代表团提出这个提案，是希望“以合法的方法处理这个问题”。叙利亚代表团没有考虑国民党的诬告案的实质，因为并不存在任何需要进行这样讨论的事实。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏奇指出：国民党的诬告案是国民党集团残余的代表提出的。他非法地占据了联合国的席位，并且在美国的代表的协助下，正企图把他的诽谤谰言人工地保留在联合国议程上。波兰代表说，他的代表团将投票反对政治委员会多数所通过的两项提案。
    美国代表杜勒斯发言表示赞成所讨论的提案，虽然他说，美国代表团认为这些提案是“不够的”。国民党集团代表继起发言，照例攻击苏联和中华人民共和国。
    乌克兰共和国代表巴拉诺夫斯基坚决反对把国民党的诬告案保留在联合国议程上。他说，诬告案的作者是反人民的国民党集团的私人代表，代表不了数亿中国人民的意志。巴拉诺夫斯基并强调指出：美国代表力图使国民党的诽谤案保留在大会议程上，是希望借此来转移舆论对于美国政府对华政策所遭失败的注意，以所谓苏联的干涉来辩解蒋介石的可耻的破产。
    白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫揭露美国代表杜勒斯及国民党分子的诽谤言论，并说他的代表团断然驳斥使国民党的诽谤案继续保留在联合国议程之上。
    萨尔瓦多、埃及、土耳其等国代表发言后，举行表决。赞成叙利亚代表团提案的有三十五票，反对的有十七票（包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、大不列颠、南非联邦、丹麦、澳大利亚等）。七个代表团弃权（包括法国、阿富汗、巴基斯坦等）。
  联大讨论“帮助复兴朝鲜”的问题
  苏联反对任何干涉朝鲜内政行动
    随后，大会审议关于联合国组织与各专门机构配合活动的问题，通过了第二、第三和第五委员会对于这个问题的共同提案。
    其后审议关于帮助朝鲜复兴的计划的问题，第二及第三联合委员会就这问题提出了报告。这个委员会提出两个提案。第一个提案规定联合国建立关于复兴朝鲜的机构，由联合国主任领导，应负责实施经济上援助朝鲜的方案，该方案根据提案应由联合国组织制定。第二个提案是关于为了实施援助朝鲜复兴方案的财政措施的。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆在说明投票的理由时特别指出，第一提案的序言是由不正确的说法为根据作成的。即所谓在朝鲜的侵略是由北朝鲜的武装部队进行的，其实，在朝鲜发生的却是美国对朝鲜人民的侵略。亚鲁疆指出：在联合国大会上讨论朝鲜独立的问题时，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基曾引证了足以证明美国侵略朝鲜、美国武装部队干涉朝鲜的无可争辩的事实和文件。美国干涉朝鲜带给朝鲜人民无限的灾难。苏联代表请大家注意，美国空军对朝鲜居民区进行野蛮的疯狂的轰炸。亚鲁疆说：既然如此，怎么可以说在朝鲜的破坏行动不是美国侵略的结果，而是什么另外的——北朝鲜呢？对问题的这样错误的说法在联合国大会的决议上是不能容许的。因此，亚鲁疆提出修正案，建议从提案的序言中删去这样的说法，即在朝鲜的侵略是什么由北朝鲜的武装部队发动的。苏联代表继而着重指出，给予朝鲜的援助不应用作与朝鲜人民利益无关的任何政治目的，不应充当外国在经济上政治上干涉朝鲜内政的手段，不应随带着任何……政治性质的行动。苏联代表宣称，关于援助朝鲜复兴的方案，应该有朝鲜人民代表参加来制订。援助朝鲜的整个方案也应在朝鲜人民代表积极参加下由联合国组织来进行。苏联代表宣称，提案内包括着容许外国有可能干涉朝鲜内政，以及赋予主任极广泛权限的条款；他对提案提出修正案，改正这些缺点。
    捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯、乌克兰代表亦相继对审议中的提案加以批评。他们都支持苏联代表团的修正案。美国代表斯巴克曼发言反对苏联代表团的修正案，重弹关于朝鲜事件的老套谰言。
    随后，举行表决。苏联代表团的修正案被否决。赞成修正案的有五国代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克）。第一提案由五十一票多数通过。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克代表团弃权。第二提案亦以多数通过。
    在白天会议的最后，大会又审议了若干次要的技术问题，随后会议即告休会。
