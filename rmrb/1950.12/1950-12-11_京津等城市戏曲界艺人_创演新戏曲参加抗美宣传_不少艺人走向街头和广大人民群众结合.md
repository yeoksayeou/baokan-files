    Performing Arts Workers in Beijing, Tianjin and Other Cities
    Create and Perform New Operas to Participate in Resist-America Propaganda
    Many Artists Go to the Streets and Integrate with the Broad Masses
    [From Our Own Correspondent] Performing arts workers in Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities, in the great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard our homes and defend the country, have actively participated in propaganda activities against American aggression. Many new opera works have emerged in various places, and many artists have gone to the streets to closely integrate with the people.
    Performing arts workers in Beijing, after more than a year of study and ideological transformation, have generally changed their past attitude of indifference to politics. They have become active participants in every general political movement, using the performance of new operas to cooperate with political tasks. Especially in the propaganda movement against American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, many artists have left the stage and gone to the streets, tirelessly participating in propaganda work in person. In July, to oppose American imperialist aggression in Taiwan, they organized a propaganda team for four consecutive days (July 23rd to 26th), traversing the east, west, north, and south of Beijing. In addition to conducting broadcast speeches, they also performed eleven programs in the forms of crosstalk, drum song, clapper talk, Xihé tune, and rhythmic story, including "American Imperialists' True Colors," "Pricking the Paper Tiger," "Defending Peace," and "Such is America," giving 41 performances and attracting more than 20,000 spectators. After the launch of the great Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, the performing arts circles, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, conducted another extensive propaganda campaign from November 17th to 20th. This time, the participation and performance were more widespread and active than any previous time. The scope of activities was not only in the city but also extended to the suburbs, thus achieving even better results than the previous time. Many artists, such as Gu Rongfu, Yin Fulai, and Xin Daming, wrote and performed their own programs. Many famous actors, such as Li Shaochun, Wu Suqiu, Huang Yuhua, Wang Yuru, Chen Yongling, Xu Donglai, Li Qianying, Xie Hongwen, Tong Baoling, Bai Fengming, Liang Xiaolou, Luo Yuping, Bai Yunsheng, Wang Yongchang, Zhao Fucheng, Yang Jufen, Wei Xikui, Xi Baokun, and Xi Caifen, also gave extremely vivid speeches. In getting close to the masses, the masses saw that they were all so serious and simple, vehemently denouncing the various crimes of American imperialism, and thus naturally respected them, reversing the incorrect attitude of looking down on artists in the past.
    Performing arts workers in Tianjin, under the unified planning, division of labor, and guidance of the Tianjin Municipal Literary and Art Circles Resist-America, Aid-Korea Committee, through more than ten meetings and symposiums of writers and artists, gained a further understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism, the relationship between China and Korea, and the strength of the world's people in defending peace. Therefore, in the propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea, they organized truck tours to promote in various streets. Many artists, such as Fu Shaofang and Yan Qiuxia, participated in performances for three or four consecutive days. When the propaganda team of the Baoding Peixin Opera Troupe performed on the streets, the audience followed them wherever they went, and the streets and alleys were crowded with people. This was the first time that artists had performed off the stage. Many people said, "Today's artists have made progress. The new society can really transform people." In the various places of Chahar Province, since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, many new cultural and entertainment programs have appeared. In Zhangjiakou alone, since November 15th, there have been six programs, including "The Flames of Seoul" and "Resist America, Aid Korea," performed in rotation in three theaters and one Quyi (folk art) society. The theatrical circles in Taiyuan held a city-wide symposium on resisting America and aiding Korea. At the meeting, it was decided that each theater and troupe should produce special editions of Resist-America, Aid-Korea wall newspapers or blackboard newspapers every week. Before each final play, the theater union or the theater's cultural and educational committee should give a ten-minute lecture on resisting America and aiding Korea, and perform more new operas on resisting America and aiding Korea and more historical plays on resisting wars of aggression. These decisions have now been turned into practical actions. Moreover, various Quyi groups are also scattered in the people's parks and various markets, singing and telling Resist-America, Aid-Korea ballads, drum lyrics, Shanxi opera, Qingchang, and Kuaiban. Performing arts workers in Guisui have used their spare time in the early and late shows to conduct street propaganda more than 40 times in the past movements such as peaceful signature campaigns, opposition to American imperialist aggression in Korea, and resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending the country.
    During this period, many new operas have been created. For example, Tianjin has completed more than ten large and small scripts, including "The Black Flag Army," "Women's City," "Blood Splattered on Seoul," "National Hero Liu Yongfu," and "Stealing the Credentials to Rescue Zhao," which will be performed in various theaters one after another. The Baoding Peixin Opera Troupe's "Resist America, Aid Korea" tableaux exposed the barbarous and shameless acts of American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and explained that the final victory must belong to the people, which was well received by the audience after the performance.

    京津等城市戏曲界艺人
    创演新戏曲参加抗美宣传   
    不少艺人走向街头和广大人民群众结合
    【本报讯】京津等城市戏曲界艺人，在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动中，积极参加反对美国侵略宣传活动，各地并出现不少新戏曲作品；许多艺人走向街头，和人民群众紧密结合在一起。
    北京市戏曲界艺人，由于经过了一年多的学习和思想改造，一般都已改变过去对政治漠不关心的态度，在每一个普遍性的政治运动当中，他们都成为积极的参加者，用演唱新戏曲来配合政治任务。特别是在反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜的宣传运动中，许多艺人跑下了舞台，走上了街头，不顾疲劳地亲身参加宣传工作。在七月间为了反对美帝侵略台湾，他们曾一连四天（二十三日至二十六日）组织了宣传队，走遍了京市的东西南北各城，除进行广播演讲外，更通过相声、大鼓、快板、西河调、数来宝等形式演唱了《美帝现形记》、《戳穿纸老虎》、《保卫和平》、《如此美国》等十一个节目，演出四十一场，吸收了观众达两万多。在伟大的抗美援朝运动展开后，戏曲界在京市文艺处、文联的领导下，从十一月十七日到二十日，又作了一次广泛的宣传，而且这次所参加的、表现的，比过去任何一次都普遍和积极。活动范围不仅在市内，且到了郊区。因之也起了比上次更好的作用。许多艺人如顾荣甫、尹福来、辛大明等都自编自演。还有许多名演员如：李少春、吴素秋、黄玉华、王玉如、陈永玲、徐东来、李倩影、谢虹雯、童葆苓、白凤鸣、良小楼、罗玉苹、白云生、王永昌、赵富成、杨菊芬、魏喜奎、席宝昆、喜彩芬等都作了极生动的演讲。在接近群众当中，群众看到他们都是那么严肃而朴素，激动地在痛斥美帝的种种罪行，因之很自然地对他们钦敬起来，一反过去那种轻视艺人的不正确态度。
    天津市戏曲界艺人，在天津市文艺界抗美援朝委员会的统一计划分工指导下，经过十余次的作家、艺人会议及座谈，对美帝侵略本质、中朝关系、世界人民保卫和平的力量等问题，都有了进一步的认识，因而在抗美援朝的宣传中，曾组织卡车巡回各街道宣传。许多艺人如富少舫、阎秋霞等多人一连三、四天都参加了表演。保定培新剧社的三十余位男女演员在进行街头演出时，宣传队到那里，观众跟到那里，街头巷尾，人山人海。因为艺人下台演戏，这还是第一次。许多人说：“今天的艺人进步了，新社会真能改造人。”察哈尔省各地戏曲界，自美帝发动侵朝战争以来，都有许多新的文娱节目出现。仅张市，自十一月十五日开始即有《汉城烽火》、《抗美援朝》等六个节目在三个戏院及一个曲艺社轮流上演。太原市的戏剧界曾经开了一次全市性的戏剧界抗美援朝座谈会，会上曾决定各剧院、剧团，每周出抗美援朝壁报或黑板报专号；并在每次压轴戏之前，由剧工会或剧院文教委员作抗美援朝讲演十分钟，以及多演抗美援朝新歌剧和多演抵抗侵略战争的历史剧。这些决定现在都已变成实际行动了。且各曲艺小组，亦都散布在人民公园各个市场里，说唱抗美援朝鼓词、坠子和山西梆子、清唱、快板等。归绥市的戏曲界艺人在和平签名、反对美帝侵略朝鲜、抗美援朝保家卫国等历次运动中，曾利用早晚场业余时间，先后进行了街头宣传达四十余次。
    在这一时期内，创作了不少新戏曲。如：天津市已完成了大小剧本《黑旗军》、《妇人城》、《血溅汉城》、《民族英雄刘永福》、《窃符救赵》等十余出，将陆续在各剧院演出。保定市培新剧社的《抗美援朝》的活报，揭露了美帝侵略台湾和朝鲜的野蛮无耻行为，并说明最后胜利一定属于人民，演出后颇得观众好评。
