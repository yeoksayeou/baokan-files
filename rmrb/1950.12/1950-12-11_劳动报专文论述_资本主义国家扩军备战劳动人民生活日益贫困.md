Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: Today, *Labor Daily* published a special article by Cheprakov, discussing the arms expansion movement and the plundering of working people in capitalist countries.

Cheprakov wrote: Accompanying the imperialists' policy of preparing and launching a new world war is a large-scale offensive against the working masses. According to the capitalist countries' ruling class, the people's existence is only for supplying, feeding, and equipping soldiers. Militarism greedily devours the labor of the common people.

The heavy burden that the arms race places on the people can be judged from the following data: In 1939, US military spending consumed 1.6 percent of the so-called national income. Now, no less than 20 percent of the total national income is being used for preparing and launching wars. We should note that even at the height of World War II, US military spending only slightly exceeded 40 percent of national income.

Cheprakov pointed out: Western European countries, following the US's war policy, have also plunged rapidly into the quagmire of arms expansion. The British Labor government is doubling its military spending, and the French government plans to spend a total of two trillion francs on military spending in the next three years. Due to the demands of the masters of fate in capitalist America, the US Congress has drastically cut the already meager budget for non-military needs, while the taxes heavily burdened on the working people continue to increase. For example, US income tax has increased by 15 to 18 percent. Notably, the income tax of the vast majority of people has increased by more than 20 percent, while the income tax of the rich has only increased by 10 to 11 percent.

Cheprakov continued: Turning a considerable amount of production, raw materials, and labor to the production of war materials has reduced the production of consumer goods. Therefore, speculation is rampant, and prices are rising. Profiteering speculators have skyrocketed the prices of important goods. Meat prices in the United States have risen by nearly 10 percent in the past three months, and food prices have risen by 15 percent. The prices of clothes and shoes have also risen. Since the US began interfering in Korea alone, the real wages of US workers have been reduced by 15.3 percent. The income of laboring farmers is also declining. Even according to official figures, the monthly consumer price index has risen by 30 percent compared to June 1946. Currently, food prices have increased by 75 percent compared to the eve of World War II.

The result of rising prices is the decline in the purchasing power of the US dollar. This means that the small savings accumulated by the working people for emergencies are devalued, and the real wages of workers are further reduced.

The working people of other capitalist countries have also been plunged deeper into the abyss of pain and disaster. In the UK, half of workers' wages are swallowed up by taxes. As a result of the arms race, the production of consumer goods needed by workers has been reduced again, which has caused new price increases and impoverishment of the people. In France, the already minimal funding for health and education is now being further reduced. Loans used for the revitalization and equipment of backward French industries are being reduced, and new taxes are being imposed on the working people. In West Germany, the prices of food and other consumer goods are constantly rising. Due to the Bonn "government's" military measures, current prices are rising especially rapidly. Currently, food prices have risen by 84 percent compared to the level of 1948, potato prices have more than doubled and butter prices have risen by 44 percent. Due to the separate decisions of the US, Britain, and France to increase their garrison in West Germany, West Germany's occupation expenses will almost double, which greatly increases the tax burden on the working people. The number of unemployed in West Germany is already over two million.

The laboring people of Japan, which has become the hereditary property of US General MacArthur, are in a very miserable situation, with 13 million people completely or partially unemployed.

Cheprakov continued: The increasing poverty of the broad masses caused by economic militarization has led to the sharpening of class struggle in capitalist countries. The struggle of the working class and laboring farmers against the deterioration of living conditions caused by war preparations has been combined with the struggle for peace.

Powerful strike movements are taking place in the United States. In France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Austria, and other capitalist countries, the masses of people are conducting persistent struggles against new military plans and against the extension of the term of military service. The Communist Parties of all countries are leading the masses to fight for their own interests of bread, freedom, and peace.

Cheprakov wrote in conclusion: The working class and laboring farmers of all countries welcome and support the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress, which is a new milestone in the powerful national movement of the whole world against the warmongers and for peace.

    劳动报专文论述
    资本主义国家扩军备战劳动人民生活日益贫困
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：今天劳动报刊载切普拉科夫的专文一篇，论述资本主义国家内的扩充军备运动和劫掠劳动人民的情况。
    切普拉科夫写道：伴随着帝国主义者准备和发动新世界战争的政策而来的是对劳动大众的大规模的攻势。依照资本主义国家统治阶级的想法，人民的生存只是为了供应、养活和装备军人。军国主义贪婪地吞噬老百姓的劳动。
    军备运动成为人民怎样的一个沉重负担可从下面的资料中判断出来：在一九三九年，美国的军费消耗了所谓国民收入的百分之一点六。在现在，不下于全部国民收入的百分之二十正用在准备和发动战争上面。我们应注意的是：甚至在第二次世界大战的高潮时期，美国的军费也不过仅仅略微超过国民收入百分之四十。
    切普拉科夫指出：西欧各国遵循着美国的战争政策，也都急遽地投身于扩充军备运动的泥淖中。英国的工党政府正在把它的军费增加一倍，法国政府打算在今后三年之内在军费上共用二万亿法郎。由于资本主义美国的命运的主宰们的要求，美国国会把已经小得可怜的非军事需要的预算开支削减了许多，而重重地加于劳动人民肩上的赋税却继续在增加。例如，美国的所得税增加了百分之十五到十八。突出的是，绝大多数人民的所得税增加了百分之二十以上，而富人的所得税仅仅增加了百分之十到十一。
    切普拉科夫继称：使相当多的生产量、原料和劳动力转向战争物资的生产就使得消费品生产减缩。因此投机事业盛极一时，物价也在上涨。趁火打劫的投机商使重要物品价格暴涨。美国在过去三个月内的肉价上涨了将近百分之十，食粮上涨了百分之十五。衣服和鞋子的价格也上涨了。单只在美国开始干涉朝鲜以后，美国工人的实际工资就已减少了百分之十五点三。劳动农民的收入也在降低之中。甚至根据官方的数字，消费品每月的物价指数已较一九四六年六月份上涨了百分之三十。目前粮食的价格较第二次世界大战前夕增加了百分之七十五。
    物价上涨的结果就是美元购买力降低。这就意味着劳动人民为了预防急需而积存的小额储蓄被贬值，工人的实际工资进一步降低。
    其他资本主义国家的劳动人民也被更深地投入了痛苦和灾难的深渊。在英国，工人工资的一半都被捐税所吞没了。军备竞赛的结果，使得工人们所需要的消费货物的生产再度削减，这样就引起新的物价高涨和人民的穷困。在法国，已经削减到最低限度的卫生和教育方面的经费，现在又更被减少。用于复兴和装备落后的法国工业的贷款正在缩减，并以新的赋税压在劳动人民的身上。在西德，粮食和其他消费货物的价格正在不断上涨。由于波恩“政府”的军事措施，目前的物价尤其飞快上升。目前粮食的价格较一九四八年的水平上涨了百分之八十四，马铃薯的价格高涨了两倍半，牛油的价格上涨了百分之四十四。由于美、英、法分别决定增加他们西德的驻军，西德的占领经费，几乎将要增加一倍，这就大大增加了劳动人民的捐税负担。西德的失业人数已在两百万以上。
    已经变成了美国将军麦克阿瑟世袭财产的日本劳动人民，正处于非常悲惨的境地，有一千三百万人完全或部分地失业。
    切普拉科夫继续写道：由于经济军事化所造成的广大群众日益增加的贫困，引起了资本主义各国阶级斗争的尖锐化。工人阶级与劳动农民为了反对由于战争准备所造成的生活条件的恶化而进行的斗争已与争取和平的斗争结合起来。
    有力的罢工运动正在美国进行。在法国、意大利、日本、比利时、奥地利、与其他资本主义国家里，人民群众正在进行坚持的斗争，以反对新的军备计划，反对延长兵役的期限。各国的共产党都在领导群众，为他们的面包、自由、与和平的切身利益而斗争。
    切普拉科夫在结语中写道：一切国家的工人阶级与劳动农民们，都欢迎而且支持第二届保卫世界和平大会的决议，这一次的保卫世界和平大会，是全世界反对战争贩子与争取和平的强有力的全国规模运动的新的里程碑。
