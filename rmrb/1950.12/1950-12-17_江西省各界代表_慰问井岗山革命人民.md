Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 14th: The Jinggang Mountain Comfort Group, led by Li Li, Secretary of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Ji'an Local Committee, visited the revolutionary homeland of Jinggang Mountain in late November on behalf of the people of all circles in Jiangxi Province to express their regards to the revolutionary people. All members of the group first paid respects to the tombs of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle over the years in Jinggang Mountain. Subsequently, they visited the people in various mountain villages and distributed 50,000 catties of comfort grain to the families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and poor peasants who had been ravaged by the Kuomintang bandit army. The comfort group held a mass meeting of more than 500 people and a grand dinner in Ciping Village, where Chairman Mao once lived. Peasants from 50 miles away rushed to participate. Representatives of the masses attending the meeting unanimously passed a letter to Chairman Mao on behalf of all the people of Jinggang Mountain, requesting the reconstruction of Chairman Mao's former residence in Ciping, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, the establishment of Mao Zedong Elementary School, and the construction of a Jinggang Mountain Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower and Martyrs Cemetery.
It is reported that since the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army left Jinggang Mountain, two-thirds of the peasants in the major villages of Jinggang Mountain, Da Jing (Big Well) and Xiao Jing (Small Well), were brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary bandit gang. However, the people of Jinggang Mountain, who were once directly led by Chairman Mao, did not succumb. They bravely carried out various struggles against the bandit army in extremely difficult circumstances. After the liberation of Suichuan County last August, the people of Jinggang Mountain immediately devoted themselves to various tasks with unparalleled enthusiasm. First, they assisted the long-separated sons and daughters of soldiers—a unit of the People's Liberation Army—in capturing the counter-revolutionary bandit leader Xiao Jiabi, who had murdered more than a thousand revolutionary people and revolutionary cadres in Jinggang Mountain. This year, they completed the task of collecting 70,000 catties of autumn public grain in the entire area in seven days. In order to rebuild Jinggang Mountain, the birthplace of the Chinese revolution, the Ji'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi Province and the Suichuan County People's Government have now organized the Jinggang Mountain Construction Committee to plan construction work.

    江西省各界代表  
    慰问井岗山革命人民
    【新华社南昌十四日电】由中共江西省吉安地方委员会书记李立率领的井岗山慰问团，代表江西省各界人民于十一月下旬前往慰问革命故乡——井岗山的革命人民。全体团员在井岗山首先祭扫了多年来在革命斗争中牺牲的烈士的陵墓。随即分别慰问山区各村人民，并发给烈士、军人、干部家属及曾受国民党匪军摧残的贫苦农民慰问粮五万斤。慰问团在毛主席住过的茨坪村举行了五百余人的群众大会和盛大聚餐，五十里以外的农民都纷纷赶来参加。与会群众代表井岗山全体人民一致通过上书毛主席，请求重建被国民党匪帮破坏的茨坪毛主席故居，举办毛泽东小学及建立井岗山革命烈士纪念塔和烈士公墓。
    按自中国工农红军离开井岗山之后，井岗山上主要村庄的大小井有三分之二的农民惨遭蒋介石反动匪帮的杀害。但是曾经在毛主席直接领导下的井岗山人民没有屈服，他们在万分险恶的环境下英勇地向匪军进行了各种斗争。去年八月遂川县解放后，井岗山人民立即以无比的热情投入各项工作。首先，协助久别归来的子弟兵——人民解放军某部生擒了曾经杀害井岗山革命人民和革命干部千余人的反革命匪首萧家壁，今年又在七天中完成了全区七万斤的秋季公粮的任务。为了重建中国革命故乡井岗山，江西省吉安专署及遂川县人民政府现已组织成立井岗山建设委员会，筹划建设工作。
