    "Little Hero"
    During the Soviet people's Great Patriotic War, heroes emerged such as the members of the Young Guard, Danya, Marite, Matrosov, Pavlov, and Zaslonov, and even a child like Vanya was unwilling to hide in the safer rear, but wanted to dedicate a small but very tenacious strength to the front.
    Vanya is the protagonist of the film "Little Hero." He lost his parents and relatives in the large-scale invasion by the German Kou (a derogatory term for the enemy, here referring to the German invaders) and wandered in the war zone. After he was taken in by Red Army soldiers, he quickly became a little hero.
    Vanya, a child of only eleven or twelve years old, why would he be like this? Obviously, on the one hand, the disasters brought by the fascist bandits' war of aggression gave him practical education, and on the other hand, the vague patriotism that had been cultivated in him since childhood was developed and gradually clarified through realistic education. He realized that without eliminating the enemy, there would be no peaceful and happy life; the most urgent task at hand was to directly strike the enemy on the battlefield to defend the motherland.
    We can fully believe that Vanya is a good child in a peaceful environment and will definitely become a good worker when he grows up. However, the flames of the war of aggression burned on him, making it impossible for him to grow up in a peaceful environment. Therefore, he chose the path of directly striking the enemy. Only by eliminating the enemy can there be true peace.
    Today, the Chinese people who volunteer to go to Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, have chosen the same path as Vanya, which is also the path of combining patriotism and internationalism.
    The little hero Vanya gives us a profound education. In the great patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, we will gain great inspiration from this film.

    “小英雄”
    在苏联人民伟大卫国战争中，曾经涌现了如青年近卫军中的青年团员们、丹娘、玛丽特、马特洛索夫、巴甫洛夫、札斯罗诺夫那样的英雄们，就连像伐尼亚这样的一个孩子，也不愿意躲到比较安全的大后方去，而要在前线献出一分虽然微小却非常顽强的力量来。
    伐尼亚是影片“小英雄”的主角。他曾在德寇的大举进侵中丧失了父母和亲人，流浪在战地里。当他被红军战士收留下来之后，很快的成为一个小英雄了。
    伐尼亚，一个不过十一、二岁的孩子，为什么会这样呢？很显然，一方面是法西斯强盗的侵略战争带来的灾害给了他实际的教育，一方面也是他从小就被培养起来的朦胧的爱国主义的精神经过了现实的教育而发扬了、逐渐明确了的缘故。他认识到不消灭敌人，就没有和平幸福的生活；眼前最迫切的任务就是在战地上直接打击敌人，以保卫祖国。
    我们可以完全相信，伐尼亚在和平环境中是一个好孩子，一定会在长大之后成为一个好的劳动者。但是，侵略战争的火焰烧到了他的身上，不可能让他在和平环境中成长，因此，他选择了直接打击敌人的道路，只有消灭敌人，才能有真正的和平。
    今天志愿到朝鲜去抗美援朝、保家卫国的中国人民所选择的道路也就是伐尼亚的道路，也是爱国主义与国际主义结合的道路。
    小英雄伐尼亚，给予我们的教育是深刻的，在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动中，我们将从这部影片中得到很大的启示。
