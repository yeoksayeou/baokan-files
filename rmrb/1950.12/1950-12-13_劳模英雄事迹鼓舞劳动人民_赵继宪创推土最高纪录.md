    Model Worker Heroic Deeds Inspire Working People
    Zhao Jixian Sets Highest Record in Bulldozing
    [Report from this newspaper] Zhao Jixian, a worker in the recent plain area of the Shou Zhang embankment section of the Yellow River, has created the highest national record by pushing and transporting 29.7 cubic meters of earth in one day. Xia Chongwen, a bulldozer hero who attended the National Model Worker Conference, had a highest record of 27.65 cubic meters.
    The propaganda float organized by the Pingyuan Provincial Winter Repair Headquarters has greatly encouraged the workers. On November 17, as soon as the propaganda float arrived, the workers surged like a tide. They shouted, "Let's see the twenty-eight *fang* who went to Beijing!" Xia Chongwen recounted how he achieved his success and how he met Chairman Mao. People showed infinite admiration and envy. Zhao Jixian kept repeating one sentence: "How glorious!" On the one hand, he was skeptical of Xia Chongwen's achievements, and on the other hand, there was a potential that prompted him to try it himself. On the morning of the 19th, at the construction site north of Sunkou, Zhao Jixian asked Zhang, the section chief, to draw him a separate earth pond. He started working when the sun came out, with his own small cart and a shovel, loading and transporting himself. The transport distance was 60 meters. By 5:30 p.m. when he stopped work, he had pushed 21 cubic meters of earth in eight hours, earning 46.2 *jin* of rice in wages. At this time, he completely believed in Xia Chongwen's achievements and decided to try again the next day. On the 20th, another earth pond was designated. On this day, he worked for 9 hours and 55 minutes, pushing 217 carts of earth, equivalent to 27.335 cubic meters, earning 63.88 *jin* of rice in wages. On the morning of the 22nd, he started working at 8:30 a.m. and worked for a total of 10 hours and 15 minutes. The transport distance was 52 meters, and he pushed a total of 29.7 cubic meters of earth, creating the highest national record.
    Zhao Jixian was born into a poor peasant family and worked as a hired laborer for landlords since he was a child. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, he stood up. In the successive dike restorations, he always worked harder than others. He knows that a happy life must be earned by oneself.

    劳模英雄事迹鼓舞劳动人民
    赵继宪创推土最高纪录
    【本报讯】在最近的平原寿张堤段治理黄河的民工赵继宪，以一日推运二十九点七方土的成绩创造了全国最高纪录。曾出席全国劳模大会的推土英雄夏崇文，最高纪录为二十七点六五方。
    平原省冬修指挥部组织的宣传彩车，对民工有着极大的鼓舞作用。十一月十七日，宣传彩车刚来到这里，民工们便像潮水一样汹涌而来。他们喊道：“看看进京的二十八方！”夏崇文讲述了他如何创造了成绩以及怎样会见了毛主席的情景。人们都显露着无限惊赞与羡慕的神情。赵继宪不断地重复着一句话：多光荣啊！他一方面对夏崇文的成绩半信半疑，一方面又有一种潜力促使他也想试一下。十九日早晨，在孙口北的工地上，赵继宪要求段里张股长给他单划一个土塘。太阳出来时他开始工作，自己一辆小车，一张锹，自装自运。运距是六十公尺。至下午五点半下工，一天八小时共推土二十一方，得工资米四十六点二斤。这时他完全相信了夏崇文的成绩，并决定第二天再试试。二十日又划了土塘。这天工作九点五十五分钟，推土二百一十七车，合土二十七点三三五方，得工资米六十三点八八斤。二十二号早晨八点半开始工作，共工作十点零十五分钟。运距五十二公尺，共推土二十九点七方，创造了全国最高纪录。
    赵继宪出身贫农，从小给地主当长工，在共产党领导下翻了身。在历次复堤中他总比别人卖力气。他知道幸福的生活必须自己来争取。（平原黄河河务局通讯组）
