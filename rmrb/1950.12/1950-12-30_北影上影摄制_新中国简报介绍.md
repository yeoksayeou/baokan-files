The "New China Briefing," produced by the Beijing Film Studio and Shanghai Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau, has reached its 54th issue by this week. The most recent issues have very quickly reflected the various aspects of the surging movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend the country, and protect our homes. Issues 51 and 53, currently being screened in theaters in the city, report on the enthusiastic promotion of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in various government agencies, schools, factories, and rural areas in Beijing and the Northeast, as well as people signing up to join the Volunteer Army, sending off the Volunteer Army, and launching production competitions. Of particular note is the upcoming release of Issue 54. This issue reports on the true situation of the US imperialists bombing the Yalu River Bridge. This is a powerful accusation that exposes the hypocritical face of US imperialism in the United Nations. It will use the US imperialists' own actions to educate the people to hate US imperialism. The "New China Briefing" was originally scheduled to release 48 issues this year, but it has already exceeded its target and will release 60 issues by the end of the year. In addition to the aforementioned issues 51, 53, and 54, issues 55 to 60 all report on current affairs. The situation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army capturing a large number of US military prisoners on the anti-American front lines will be included in issue 60.

    新中国简报介绍
    中央电影局北京电影制片厂及上海电影制片厂出品的《新中国简报》届至本周为止，已出至五十四号。最近几号非常迅速的反映了怒潮般的抗美援朝卫国保家运动各方面活动情况。正在本市各影院上映的五十一号及五十三号、报道了北京各机关学校及东北工厂农村热烈展开抗美援朝运动的宣传、报名参加志愿军、欢送志愿军出发及发动生产竞赛等等情况。特别值得注意的是即将公映的第五十四号。这一号里报道了美帝国主义轰炸鸭绿江桥的真实情况。这是一个强而有力的控诉，它揭穿了美帝国主义在联合国上的伪善面孔，它将用美帝自己的行动来教育人民仇视美帝。《新中国简报》原定年内出至四十八号，现已超额完成任务，至年底将出至六十号。除上述五十一、五十三及五十四号外，五十五到六十号都是报道目前时事的内容。朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿部队在反美前线捉获大批美军俘虏的情况，将编入第六十号。
