　　【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th】Following the departure of the Shanghai medical workers' volunteer surgical team led by Li Lanting to Korea, more than fifty male and female doctors and nurses have signed up voluntarily to serve on the Korean battlefield. Among them are Dr. Lu Shufan, who won the title of Second Class Merit Citation for participating in the treatment of schistosomiasis in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army last year, and Dr. Zhang Mingxi, a surgeon who studied in the United States. Among the female medical workers who signed up are Gu Jie, who has only been married for two months, and Li Ningke, a mother of three children. In order to express their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country, they are willing to serve on the front lines in Korea.
