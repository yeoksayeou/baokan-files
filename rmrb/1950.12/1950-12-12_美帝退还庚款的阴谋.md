The American Imperialists' Conspiracy in Returning the Boxer Indemnity
	Qinghua University Economics Department Second Year Banking Specialization Class Communist Youth League Branch
As everyone knows, our old Tsinghua School was established with the "Boxer Indemnity" returned by the United States. The viciousness and insidiousness of this method of cultural and educational aggression used by the United States far surpasses that of cannons and warships. "To win the mind is paramount." American imperialism attempted to use this to spiritually control and influence us; to cultivate batches of "talent" to faithfully serve the American aggression cause, and to use this to display a hypocritical friendly posture to broadly buy off Chinese "hearts," to bewilder and numb the Chinese people, making our Chinese people unknowingly develop goodwill towards it, willingly accepting its rule and enslavement. This is the American imperialists' far-sighted and doubly profitable "masterpiece." At the time, a German newspaper in Beijing said: "The United States focuses on cultural activities, playing for keeps!" This hits the nail right on the head!

The return of the "Boxer Indemnity" was such a malicious conspiracy that in 1923, all the imperialists followed suit, vying to return the "Boxer Indemnity" on their own initiative, vigorously establishing universities, middle schools, primary schools, and even kindergartens, hoping to instill the morality, thought, and culture of imperialist enslavement of colonies into the minds of the Chinese people as widely and deeply as possible.

In Acheson's letter to Truman last year, he traced the history of nearly a century of "friendship" between China and the United States, repeatedly saying: "This friendship can be proven by many facts over the years, such as the use of the Boxer Indemnity..." Obviously, he still wants to use this "friendship" to deceive and numb the Chinese people—especially those from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, or the so-called "democratic individualistic liberals" in their minds. The Chinese people of today will not find it difficult to understand this "effort" of the American imperialists. In the eyes of the American bourgeoisie, everything can be reduced to "money," reduced to the debit and credit sides of accounting books. "Education" is like this, and "friendship" is no exception.

The so-called "returning the Boxer Indemnity" was originally proposed in 1904, passed by the US Congress in 1907, and implemented in 1909. To understand this "friendly" move by the American imperialists, one must mention the anti-American goods movement in various parts of China in 1905. In the late 19th century, the United States was vigorously implementing a policy of excluding Chinese laborers, carrying out large-scale, planned persecution and massacre of overseas Chinese. In 1901, 56,000 overseas Chinese in the United States, including Situ Fang and Cui Zijian, submitted a petition to the then Beijing government, stating: "Harsh regulations are emerging one after another, which is shocking... Whenever Chinese people are in the ports, they are often beaten... Hundreds of people are often imprisoned. Chinese people who die from illness often have their corpses mutilated."

This profound "friendship" of the American imperialists aroused widespread anger among the people in China at the time. In 1905, merchants in coastal areas of China widely launched a movement to boycott American goods. Everyone should remember that this was the first time the Chinese people used the weapon of economic severance against imperialism, and it was also the first time imperialism recognized the mass power of the Chinese people! The American imperialists were very clever. After this head-on blow, they had to change their course, feigning a friendly posture to buy off the hearts of the Chinese people. "Returning the Boxer Indemnity" arose from this meaning. The most vigorous proponent at the time was Arthur H. Smith. He was a businessman and missionary with 40 years of experience working in China. In 1906, he personally met with US President Roosevelt, strongly arguing for the benefits of using the "Boxer Indemnity" to cultivate Chinese students studying in the United States.

Smith published a book in 1907 called "China and America Today," the first chapter of which was "America's Opportunities and Responsibilities in China," explaining that Chinese students coming to the United States was a matter of urgency and could not be ignored. E.J.S. James, the president of the University of Illinois, gave a memorandum to the US President, which was quoted in full in the book. Here is a translated excerpt:

"If the United States had managed to direct the trend of Chinese students to this country thirty years ago, and expanded this trend, then we would now be able to use the most satisfactory and ingenious method to control the development of China, using the method of intellectually and spiritually dominating the leaders of China.

The president pointed out in the memorandum the fact that there were many Chinese students not only in Japan but also in Europe, expressing great anxiety. He said: "This means that after these Chinese return from Europe, they will make China emulate Europe, emulate England, Germany, and France, and not emulate the United States. This means that they will recommend British, French, and German goods, and the Chinese people will buy a large number of goods from European countries instead of American goods; various industrial privileges will be given to Europe instead of the United States." Look, how clearly it is stated! According to the imperialist thinking, there are so many "benefits" to Chinese students studying in the United States. Thus, this university president made the following conclusion to his president:

"Spending some money to expand spiritual influence, even if only from a material point of view, can be more rewarding than using other methods. Commerce follows spiritual domination and is more reliable than a military banner."

This really reveals the motive and essence of the American "return of the Boxer Indemnity" very thoroughly, and completely exposes the vicious and insidious face behind the American imperialists' "friendship" towards the Chinese people.

We must take practical actions to wash away this shame and shatter the American imperialists' plan of aggression.

    美帝退还庚款的阴谋
    清华大学经济系二年级银行专修科团支部
    众所周知，我们过去旧的清华学校，是美国退还“庚子赔款”兴办的。美国这种以文化教育方式侵略中国的手段之毒辣阴险，远非大炮、军舰所能比拟。“攻心为上”，美帝就是企图借此在精神上来支配我们，影响我们；培养出一批批的“人材”，来为美国侵略事业忠诚服务，并且借以表现虚伪的友好姿态，来广泛地收买中国“人心”，来迷惑与麻醉中国人民，使我们中国人民在不知不觉中对它发生好感，心甘情愿的受其统治与奴役。这就是美帝国主义深谋远虑一箭双雕的“杰作”。当时北京一家德国报纸就曾说：“美国注重文化活动，打的是永久算盘！”这话真是一针见血！
    退还“庚款”是这样一个恶毒的阴谋，无怪到了一九二三年，各帝国主义者也都群起效尤，纷纷自动退还“庚款”，大力兴办大学、中学、小学，甚至幼稚园等，希望将帝国主义奴役殖民地的道德、思想、文化尽量广泛而深入地装进中国人民的头脑中。
    去年艾奇逊致杜鲁门的信中，追溯到中美近百年的“友谊”历史，他口口声声地说：“这种友谊是可以用许多年来种种事实予以证明，诸如利用庚子赔款……”显然还想以这种“友谊”来欺骗与麻醉中国人民——尤其是资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的人们，或是他们心目中的所谓“民主个人自由主义者”们。美帝这种“苦心”，今天的中国人民是不难理解的。在美国资产阶级，一切都可还原为“钱”，还原为会计帐目上的借方与贷方。“教育”是如此，“友谊”也不能例外。
    所谓“退还庚子赔款”，原是起议于一九○四年，一九○七年由美国会通过，而于一九○九年开始实行。要明白美帝这番“友谊”的举动，不能不说到一九○五年中国各地抵制美货运动。在十九世纪末叶，美帝正厉行排斥华工政策，进行大规模有计划的对华侨迫害与虐杀。一九○一年，旅美华侨司徒芳、崔子肩等五万六千人曾呈文当时的北京政府，内说：“苛例百出，令人骇绝……凡埠中华人，辄遇痛殴……幽囚常数百人，华人以常病致死，亦须戮尸。”
    美帝的这种深挚“友谊”，当时引起中国国内人民普遍的愤怒。一九○五年，中国沿海各地商人，就广泛地展开了抵制美货运动。大家记住，这是中国人民第一次对帝国主义使用了经济绝交武器，也使帝国主义第一次认识了中国人民的群众力量！美帝是十分乖巧的，经此迎面一击，就不得不改弦更张，伪装起友善的姿态，来收买中国的人心。“退还庚款”就是从这个意义上产生的。当时提倡最力的是斯密斯（Arthur.H.Sm th）。这是一个在中国有四十年工作经验的商人兼传教士。他在一九○六年曾面谒美总统罗斯福，力陈以“庚款”来培植中国留学生的好处。
    斯密斯于一九○七年出版了一本书，叫做“今日的中国与美国”，首一章是“美国在中国的机会与责任”，说明中国留学生到美国，是当务之急，不可忽略。美国伊里诺大学校长詹姆士（E.J.S.James）给美国总统一个备忘录，全文引录在书里。这里抄译一段：
    “如果美国在三十年以前，已经做到把中国留学生潮流引向这一个国家来，并使这潮流扩大，那么，我们现在一定能够使用最圆满与最巧妙的方式，而控制中国的发展，使用从知识与精神上支配中国领袖的方式。
    这位校长在备忘录中特别指出不仅在日本，而且在欧洲都已有很多中国留学生的事实，而表示十分焦急，他说：“这就意味着，这些中国人从欧洲回去后，将要使中国效法欧洲，效法英、德、法诸国，而不效法美国。这就意味着，他们将推荐英国、法国与德国的商品，中国人民将大量购买欧洲诸国的货物，而不买美国的商品；各样工业上的特权将给予欧洲而不是给予美国。”看呀，说的多明白！照帝国主义的想法，中国学生到美国留学有这么多的“好处”。于是这位大学校长向他的总统先生作了如此的结论：
    “为了扩张精神上的影响而花些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能够比用别的方法收获得更多。商业追随精神上支配，是比军旗更为可靠。”
    这实在把美国“退还庚款”的动机与本质说得非常透彻，而美帝对中国人民“友谊”背后的毒辣阴险面目也全部暴露出来了。
    我们一定要以实际行动来洗雪这番耻辱，打碎美帝的侵略计划。
