Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Following the rally held by the Beijing Overseas Chinese Association on December 4th to expose and protest the British government's atrocities against Overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Chinese people are extremely indignant about the persecution of Overseas Chinese in Malaya. The All-China Federation of Trade Union, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and All-China Students' Federation have jointly sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Attlee, expressing their protest. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued the following statement regarding this matter:

In the past two or three years, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have continuously carried out frantic persecution against our People's Republic of China's overseas citizens residing there, amidst their bloody war of slaughtering the people of Malaya. From June 1948 to August 1950, according to extremely incomplete statistics, more than 35,000 Overseas Chinese were deported. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on June 15th of this year, "British Colonial Secretary Griffiths told the House of Commons that Singapore and the Federation of Malaya are currently detaining 10,857 people." Furthermore, according to the "United Federation Prison Department Report" published in the British-controlled Sin Chew Jit Poh on October 7th of this year, "The increasing number of prisoners has become a major problem for the department." It also stated: "The number of people sent to prison last year totaled 15,364." According to confirmed information, the concentration camps, detention centers, prisons, and secret prisons in Malaya are filled with people of all ethnic groups in Malaya, most of whom are Overseas Chinese. This is the case in larger concentration camps, such as the Qi Zhang Shan concentration camp in Singapore, the Johor Bahru concentration camp, the Kluang concentration camp, the Seremban concentration camp in Negeri Sembilan, the Rawang concentration camp in Selangor, the Bidor concentration camp, the Penang concentration camp, and smaller concentration camps, secret prisons, and detention centers.

Under the British colonial authorities' brutal policy of slaughter, unspeakable acts of inhumane and arbitrary killing of our Overseas Chinese citizens have occurred. For example, on September 19, 1948, Yin Jianrun, a Chinese elementary school student in the Yelan Labu village of the Kampar district, was shot and killed by a British soldier simply because the soldier asked where there were girls, and the student did not know how to answer. Another example: On December 13, 1948, twenty-five Chinese rubber workers in Selangor were brutally killed by British troops simply because they told British officers that they had not seen any communists. Innocent Overseas Chinese being sentenced to death is even more common. The execution of Wang Guang, an Overseas Chinese in Kuala Lumpur, on August 11th of this year, is one example (the above cases were all published in Singapore newspapers in January, December 1949, and August 1950). But these are just examples of individual killings. Agence France-Presse reported on May 6, 1949, that the Under-Secretary of the British Colonial Office revealed in a speech at the University of Leicester on the 6th that out of the 557 people killed in Malaya, 542 were Overseas Chinese. The number of Overseas Chinese killed by the British colonial authorities is actually impossible to count, because in addition to shooting and hanging, the British colonial authorities also killed Overseas Chinese by beating them severely, torturing them to death in prisons or concentration camps, or injecting them with poisons that would be released at regular intervals.

In their war of slaughtering the people of Malaya, the British colonial authorities also employed a vicious method of persecuting Overseas Chinese: creating large numbers of uninhabited areas, causing tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese to be bankrupted and forced to relocate. For example, in August of this year, the British colonial authorities decided to relocate more than 20,000 residents in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur. Similar incidents are numerous, and even entire houses and properties are set ablaze by the British Malayan military police. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on March 16th of this year, British Colonial Secretary Griffiths stated in the British Parliament on the same day: "The number of 'displaced' Overseas Chinese in Malaya has reached 400,000."

Simultaneous with the above acts of persecution against Overseas Chinese, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have further adopted a policy of mass deportation of Overseas Chinese. As early as the spring and summer of this year, the British colonial authorities in Malaya spread rumors that they would deport 60,000 Overseas Chinese within a year. Sure enough, the 693 Overseas Chinese victims who were recently deported back to China arrived at the southern port of Shantou on November 24th of this year. According to news confirmed by British officials and returned Overseas Chinese from various sources, the British colonial authorities in Malaya are about to deport Overseas Chinese in batches. Those who have been deported back to Shantou are only the first batch, and deportation is possible at any time in the future.

Overseas Chinese have a long history in Malaya, and their economic and social life is inextricably linked to the people of Malaya. The great contribution of Overseas Chinese to Malayan production and construction, as well as their heroic struggle in the War of Resistance Against Japan, even the British colonial authorities have had to publicly acknowledge. However, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have carried out such cruel and barbaric persecution against Overseas Chinese, which is intolerable to civilized humanity. Now the British colonial authorities' persecution of Overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly serious, exceeding any persecution suffered by Chinese overseas citizens in Southeast Asian countries in the past, whether in terms of the cruelty of the situation, the scale, or the number of people involved. Our Central People's Government cannot but express serious concern about this situation. We believe that the British colonial authorities in Malaya should be held responsible for the persecution of Overseas Chinese, and the British government should also be held responsible. We now condemn the British government and the British colonial authorities in Malaya for this mad and barbaric crime of persecuting Chinese overseas citizens before all peace-loving and humanitarian people in the world. We demand that the British government and the British colonial authorities in Malaya immediately stop the policy of persecuting and deporting Overseas Chinese, immediately release all Overseas Chinese in Malayan concentration camps, ensure their freedom to reside in Malaya, protect their lives, property and all other legitimate rights and interests, and compensate them for all losses suffered due to illegal persecution. At the same time, we must solemnly declare that the British government and the British colonial authorities in Malaya shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from the persecution and deportation of Chinese overseas citizens.

    我外交部发言人发表声明
    谴责英当局迫害马来亚侨胞
    要求立即释放马来亚集中营全部华侨，保障华侨的居住自由、生命财产的安全，并赔偿一切损失。            
    【新华社二十九日讯】在北京归国华侨联谊会于十二月四日举行大会，揭露并抗议英国政府迫害马来亚华侨的暴行后，我国人民对马来亚华侨被迫害事，异常愤慨。全国总工会、全国民主妇联、全国民主青联及全国学联曾联名致电英政府首相艾德礼，表示抗议。我外交部发言人特就此事发表声明如下：
    最近两三年来，马来亚英国殖民当局在其进行屠杀马来亚人民的血腥战争中，对我中华人民共和国居留当地的侨民曾不断进行疯狂的迫害。自一九四八年六月至一九五○年八月，华侨被驱逐出境者，据极不完全的统计，即达三万五千人以上。据今年六月十五日伦敦美联社消息：“英国政府殖民部大臣格里非斯告众议院称：新加坡和马来联邦目前仍拘留着一万零八百五十七人”。又据今年十月七日英国御用的星洲日报刊载“联合邦监狱部报告书”称：“犯人人数不断增加，已成为本部面对的一个重大问题”。又称：“去年内被送进监狱的人数共计一万五千三百六十四名”。又据已经确实知道的消息，马来亚现在的集中营、拘留所、监狱、秘密监狱中，充塞了马来亚的各族人民，而其中为数最多的均为华侨。较大的集中营，如新加坡棋樟山集中营，柔佛新山集中营、居銮集中营、森美兰芙蓉集中营、雪兰峨毛立集中营、比叨集中营、槟榔屿集中营等，以及较小的集中营、秘密监狱、拘留所，无不如此。
    在英国殖民当局残暴的屠杀政策下，惨无人道地任意地杀害我侨胞的事件，不胜列举。如一九四八年九月十九日，金宝区夜兰拉布村一华侨小学生尹建润被英兵枪杀，仅因该兵问何处有女郎，该生不知所对，便被开枪击毙。又如：一九四八年十二月十三日雪兰峨州有二十五个华侨树胶工人，仅因回答英国军官没有看见共产党，即被英军惨杀，华侨无辜被处死刑的，更时有所闻。今年八月十一日，吉隆坡华侨王光无辜被处死刑，即是一例（以上各件，一九四九年一月、十二月及一九五○年八月新加坡各报均有刊载）。但这些仅仅是一些个别屠杀事件的例子。法新社一九四九年五月六日曾报导英殖民部次长六日在雷士德大学演说中透露在马来亚所杀毙的五百五十七人中，有五百四十二名为华侨。华侨遭英殖民当局杀害的数字，实无法统计，因为英国殖民当局杀害华侨，除枪杀和绞死之外，还有殴打重伤致死的，有被虐待死于狱中或集中营的，有被注射毒剂定期发毒而死的。
    英殖民当局在其屠杀马来亚人民的战争当中，还有一种迫害华侨的毒辣方法，就是大量制造无人区，致使成千成万的华侨，倾家荡产，被迫迁居。如今年八月间，英殖民当局曾决定将吉隆坡市郊居民二万余人实行迁居。类似事件比比皆是，甚至全部房屋财产为英国马来亚军警付之一炬。据伦敦今年三月十六日路透电，英国殖民部大臣格里非斯同日在英国议会宣称：“马来亚‘流离失所’的华侨，已达四十万人”。
    与上述对于华侨的迫害行为同时，马来亚英国殖民当局更进一步采取大量驱逐华侨的政策。远在今年春夏之间，马来亚英国殖民当局即四处散布谣言，要在一年以内驱逐华侨六万人出境。果然，最近被逐回国的受难华侨六百九十三名，已于本年十一月二十四日抵达我国南方港口汕头。据英官方及归国华侨各方面的消息证实：马来亚英国殖民当局，即将一批一批地驱逐华侨出境。现被驱逐回到汕头的不过是第一批，今后均有随时遭受驱逐的可能。
    华侨在马来亚有悠久的历史，经济生活与社会生活，均与马来亚人民血肉相连。华侨对马来亚生产建设的伟大贡献，以及在抗日战争中的英勇斗争，即英国殖民当局亦不得不公开承认。但是马来亚英国殖民当局对华侨却实行如此残酷野蛮的迫害，实为文明人类所不能容忍。现在英国殖民当局对华侨的迫害日趋严重，无论就情况的残酷而言，就规模的庞大而言，就人数的众多而言，都超过了过去任何时候中国侨民在东南亚各国所遭受的迫害。对于这种情形，我中央人民政府不能不表示严重的关切。我们认为：马来亚英国殖民当局对于华侨的迫害，不仅应由马来亚英国殖民当局负责，而且应由英国政府负责。我们现在在全世界爱好和平尊重人道的人民面前，谴责英国政府以及马来亚英国殖民当局这种疯狂的、野蛮的迫害中国侨民的罪行。我们要求：英国政府以及马来亚英国殖民当局立即停止迫害和驱逐华侨的政策，立即释放马来亚集中营全部华侨，保障他们在马来亚居住的自由，保障他们生命、财产的安全与其他一切正当的权益，赔偿他们由于非法迫害所遭受的一切损失。同时，我们必须郑重声明：英国政府与马来亚英国殖民当局，应对由于迫害与驱逐中国侨民所招致的一切后果担负完全责任。
