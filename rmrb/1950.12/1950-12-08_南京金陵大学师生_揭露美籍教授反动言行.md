Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 6th: Following the teachers and students of the private Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Nanjing exposing the anti-China and reactionary words and deeds of the school's American professor, Ferris, an imperialist element, the teachers and students of the private Jinling University also exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Roy, a professor in the Philosophy Department, and Riges, a professor in the Agricultural Engineering Department, for insulting the Chinese people and conducting imperialist propaganda. The school also held an accusation meeting on the afternoon of the 5th and put forward four demands.

Since the incident of American professor Ferris of Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences publicly insulting the Chinese people and Chinese students, the teachers and students of Jinling University have discussed the situation in light of their own school's circumstances. Students actively submitted articles to the school's wall newspaper "New Jin Da" exposing the reactionary words and deeds of Roy and Riges. On December 1st, "New Jin Da" published these accusations.

In their accusations, the students pointed out: Roy publicly reversed right and wrong, engaging in the imperialist and arbitrary propaganda of slandering the Korean people and the Chinese people. Despite the countless factual materials proving that the American government directed its puppet, Syngman Rhee, to launch the Korean War, Roy contradicted the facts and said: "If North Korea had not attacked South Korea, Syngman Rhee would not have attacked." Disregarding the fact that American imperialism crossed the Pacific Ocean and transported troops from New York to the Korean territory, 5,000 miles away, he instead said: "The outbreak of the Korean War was due to the expansion of communist forces." Roy even insulted the righteous action of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in supporting the Korean people, saying: "This is a sad thing." Roy shamelessly threatened the Chinese people, saying: "The Third World War has broken out! China cannot shirk its responsibility for the war." Roy once pretended to swear that he would not ask about politics. However, when someone pointed out that the intrusion of the American Seventh Fleet into our territorial waters was an act of aggression, he sophistically argued: The American fleet is in the water, not on land, so this cannot be considered an act of aggression.

Riges is a person with the same position as Roy. When answering Jinling University students' questions about the American planes strafing the Northeast, he said: "There were some, but only a few times, and all were misunderstandings." He also said: "China and North Korea are too close, and the pilots are new here." This is a shameless lie, because the wide Yalu River on the Sino-Korean border is visible to any pilot. Riges even more shamelessly said: "The pilots saw soldiers on the ground and couldn't distinguish between Korean and Chinese, so they strafed." This "soldier on the ground" was fabricated by Riges, because those killed by American imperialism were all Chinese workers and peasants. Imperialist elements try every possible means to deny, deceive, intimidate, and provoke, but the iron facts are merciless to the barbarous words and deeds of imperialist elements. All the cunning behaviors of imperialism cannot escape the eyes of the Chinese people.

After the students of Jinling University exposed these imperialist words and deeds, the various departments and sections of the school held meetings to discuss the matter, unanimously stating that such imperialist remarks must not be tolerated.

On the afternoon of the 5th, Jinling University held an accusation meeting of more than 1,200 people, where all the teachers and students of the school indignantly exposed this malicious slander that defamed our motherland and distorted the facts. Many students also made painful self-criticisms in connection with their own thoughts. A student, Chen Qipeng, said: "In the past, because Roy gave me a little favor, I had some feelings for Roy. Therefore, when he insulted the motherland and promoted American imperialism in front of me, I was indifferent. After the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea was launched, and the students proposed resolutely establishing hatred for the United States, I didn't know where to start. Roy wanted to educate us into people who didn't know how to love the motherland. We want to accuse the imperialists who spread this kind of poison." Professor Cao Guoqing, director of the Department of Economics of the school, said: "Roy and Riges' behavior completely confirms that he is a thorough imperialist element." Mr. Wu Zhen, representative of the faculty and staff union, said: "Such people cannot be allowed to exist in the new democratic education post." The meeting passed four propositions: First, Roy and Riges should admit that they are imperialist elements, confess their experiences in China for the past 20 years, and apologize to the people of the whole country and Jinling University. Second, expose Roy and Riges' reactionary words and deeds to the people of the whole city. Third, publish a letter to students across the country. Fourth, report to the All-China Students' Federation, requesting students across the country to support this righteous action. At the meeting, more than a dozen universities and middle schools, such as Nanjing University, Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Yuqun Middle School, and No. 2 Girls' Middle School, unanimously expressed their support for this movement at Jinling University and expressed their condolences to all the teachers and students of Jinling University.

### 南京金陵大学师生  揭露美籍教授反动言行

    南京金陵大学师生
    揭露美籍教授反动言行
    【新华社南京六日电】南京市私立金陵大学全校师生继私立金陵女子文理学院师生揭发该校帝国主义分子美籍教授费睿思敌视中国人民的反动言行之后，揭发了该校哲学系教授芮陶庵（Roy）和农工系教授林查礼（Riges）侮蔑中国人民，进行帝国主义宣传的反动言行。该校并于五日下午举行控诉大会，并提出四项要求。
    自金陵女子文理学院美籍教授费睿思公然侮辱中国人民与中国学生的事件发生后，金陵大学师生即联系本校情况进行讨论。学生们纷纷投稿该校墙报“新金大”揭露芮、林二人反动言行。十二月一日“新金大”即将这些控诉发表。
    该校学生们在控诉书中指出：芮陶庵曾公然颠倒是非，从事诽谤朝鲜人民和中国人民的帝国主义的武断宣传。尽管无数的事实材料证明是美国政府指挥它的傀儡李承晚发动了朝鲜内战，但是芮陶庵却违反事实地说：“如果不是北朝鲜进攻南朝鲜的话，李承晚是不会进攻的。”他不顾美帝国主义跨越太平洋把军队由纽约运到五千英里外的朝鲜国土上来的事实，反而说：“朝鲜战争的爆发是由于共产主义势力的扩张。”芮陶庵对于中国人民志愿部队支援朝鲜人民的正义行动竟然加以侮蔑说：“这是令人悲痛的事。”芮陶庵无耻地威胁中国人民说：“第三次世界大战是爆发了！中国是不能推卸战争责任的。”芮陶庵曾经装腔作势地说他发誓不问政治。但是，当人家指出美国第七舰队侵入我国领海是一种侵略行为时，他却强辞夺理地说：美国的舰队是在水里，没有到陆地上，这不能算是侵略行为。
    林查礼是和芮陶庵有同一立场的人。在回答金大学生关于美机扫射东北的问题时说：“是有的，但只有几次，并且全是误会。”他又说：“中朝两国隔得太近，飞行员又是初来的。”这是无耻的谎言，因为中朝边境上宽阔的鸭绿江是任何飞行员都能看到的。林查礼更无耻地说：“飞行员看见了地面上的军人，分不清朝鲜的、中国的，于是就扫射。”这个“地面上的军人”，是林查礼捏造的，因为被美帝国主义打死的都是中国的工人、农民。帝国主义分子想尽一切方法，抵赖、欺骗、恐吓、挑拨，可是铁的事实，对帝国主义分子的横蛮言行是无情的。帝国主义的一切狡猾行为是逃不出中国人民眼睛的。
    金陵大学学生将此种帝国主义言行揭发后，该校各系、各科纷纷举行会议进行讨论，一致提出：对于这种帝国主义的言论绝对不能容忍。
    五日下午，金陵大学举行了一千二百余人的控诉大会，该校全体师生悲愤地揭发这种诽谤我祖国歪曲事实的恶意中伤。许多学生并联系自己的思想作了沉痛的检讨。一个学生陈启鹏说：在以前由于芮给我一点小恩小惠，我曾对芮有些感情，因此，当他在我面前侮辱祖国宣扬美帝国主义的时候，我还一无所动。抗美援朝的爱国运动掀起后，同学们提出了坚决树立仇美思想时，我还不知从何做起。芮是要把我们教育成不知道爱祖国的人，我们要控诉散布这种毒素的帝国主义者。该校经济系主任曹国卿教授说：芮、林这种行为，完全证实了他是一个彻头彻尾的帝国主义分子。教职员工会代表吴桢先生说：在新民主主义教育工作岗位上不能容许这样的人存在。会上通过四点主张：一、芮、林应承认他们是帝国主义分子，坦白来华二十年的经过，并向全国人民与金陵大学道歉。二、向全市人民揭露芮、林的反动言行。三、发表告全国同学书。四、向中华全国学生联合会报告，要求全国学生支持这一正义行动。会上南京大学、金陵女子文理学院、育群中学、二女中等十几个大、中学校，对金陵大学这一运动一致表示支持。并对金大全体师生表示慰问。
