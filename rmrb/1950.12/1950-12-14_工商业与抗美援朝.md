    Industry, Commerce and Resisting America, Aiding Korea
    By Pu Jiexiu, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

    For decades, Chinese industry and commerce have struggled and grown under the long-term devastation of imperialist aggression, and are semi-colonial in nature. Especially in the industrial field, the oppression of imperialism is particularly severe. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, imperialists could import large quantities of goods into China for dumping, while China's industry, due to insufficient conditions, could not compete with foreign goods in terms of quality and price. For example, in the leather industry, large quantities of American leather used to be imported, suppressing the rise of China's leather industry. The suffering we endured is indescribable. Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the government, our industry and commerce have broken free from the shackles of imperialism and gradually improved. However, American imperialism is once again following the old path of Japanese fascism, attempting to expand its aggression. If we do not stop it in time, it will inevitably drag our liberated industry and commerce back into the quagmire of semi-colonialism. Everyone realizes that the suffering endured under imperialist oppression in the past must never be endured again. Therefore, in this movement to resist America and aid Korea, everyone feels that it is a matter of personal concern. This movement is conscious and spontaneous. For example, after the five patriotic covenants of the industrial and commercial circles were formulated, no industry failed to abide by them. Each industry also formulated its own covenants. We can say that the awareness of the industrial and commercial circles has been greatly improved. Recently, the industrial and commercial circles have been very enthusiastic in collecting comfort items and donations for the Korean front. This demonstration parade was launched in a planned and step-by-step manner in just over a day. This also shows that the industrial and commercial circles understand how to be masters of their own affairs. Industry and commerce must have peace to build and develop, so no one fails to take practical actions to step up production and support the Korean war against aggression. This grand demonstration parade can further tell American imperialism that not only workers and students hate imperialism, but also ordinary industrialists and businessmen are standing up to keep pace with people from all walks of life, working together to strive for the peaceful construction of the motherland and lasting world peace.

    工商业与抗美援朝
    北京市工商联筹委会副主任委员  浦洁修
    数十年来，中国工商业是在帝国主义长期侵略的摧残下，挣扎成长的，是半殖民地性的。尤其是在工业方面，所感受到的帝国主义的压迫特别严重。在国民党反动统治时期，帝国主义可以向中国输入大批货品倾销，而我国工业由于条件不够，使出品质量与价格都敌不过外货的倾销。例如就皮革业来说，过去大批美国皮革输入，压的我国的皮革业不能抬头。我们所受的痛苦是说不尽的。自从解放以后，在政府的正确领导之下，我们的工商业摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏，逐步好转起来。可是美帝国主义竟又走着日本法西斯老路，妄图扩大侵略，如果我们没有及时予以制止，势必把我国解放了的工商业再拖回到半殖民地的泥沼里。大家都认识到，从前在帝国主义压迫下所受的痛苦，决不能再捱受了。所以这次抗美援朝运动，每人都感觉到是切身有关的事。这次运动是自觉的自发的，如工商业界的五项爱国公约订出以后，没有一个行业不予以遵守。各业还定出本业的公约。我们可以说，工商界的觉悟是大大提高了。最近工商业所征集的对朝鲜前线的慰劳品和捐款显得十分踊跃。这次示威大游行，在仅仅一天余时间就有计划有步骤的发动起来。这亦说明了工商业界了解怎样做主人。工商业必须有和平才能建设，才能发展，所以没有一个人不拿实际行动表示加紧生产，支援朝鲜反侵略战争。这次游行大示威，更可以告诉美帝国主义，不但工人学生仇恨帝国主义，一般的工商业者亦站起来，要与各阶层人民看齐，共同努力，为祖国的和平建设和世界的持久和平而奋斗。
