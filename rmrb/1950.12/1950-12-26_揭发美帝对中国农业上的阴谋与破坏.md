Exposing the U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy and Sabotage Against Chinese Agriculture
Hua Shu

Last month on the 28th, when the UN Security Council was discussing the case of "Accusations of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan," the U.S. Imperialist permanent representative to the council, Austin, delivered a lengthy fallacy, repeating the platitudes about "friendship between the Chinese and American people" that Acheson had grown tired of in the "White Paper" last year. He shamelessly said: "My government feels displeasure, and my government, in view of the long-standing close friendship between the Chinese and American people, especially disapproves of such attacks." Then, burying his head in the sand, he listed a series of so-called "historical facts" of "friendship between the Chinese and American people," even portraying the "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction," which attempted to engage in conspiracy and sabotage against Chinese agriculture after the war, as being "for the benefit of Chinese farmers"—what exactly does "the benefit of Chinese farmers" from the mouths of warmongers represent? History is the best argument, and we must solemnly expose and denounce it.

I. The So-Called "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction"

The so-called "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" was actually the last and most miserable defeat of U.S. Imperialism on the economic aggression front in China. To dig up the roots, we must start with the so-called "Marshall Plan" and the "Sino-American Bilateral Agreement."

The "Sino-American Bilateral Agreement" was one of the countless traitorous treaties signed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Nanjing in July 1948. The cost was 400 million U.S. dollars, divided into "economic assistance" and "special assistance." The former, 275 million dollars, was used for activities such as issuing gold yuan notes; the latter, 125 million dollars, openly stipulated the purchase of military supplies to continue the civil war. The economic assistance of over 200 million dollars was valued by using U.S. Imperialist surplus food, cotton, oil, tobacco, fertilizer, and machinery parts, to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's military needs and logistics, and to intensify the plunder of the Chinese agricultural economy market.

In the so-called "aid to China" funds that U.S. Imperialism supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in fighting the civil war over the years, a mere 200 million U.S. dollars was no longer a big deal. However, perhaps the U.S. State Department was already worried about Austin's awkward situation in the Security Council today, and had to lay a hidden groundwork in advance, insisting on dragging a tail on the "agreement," stating that one-tenth of the economic assistance of over 200 million dollars would be used for the implementation of the "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction."

The drafting of this "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" was said to have initially originated from the "Yan's Plan" concocted by James Yen, an international swindler in the field of rural education. Everyone remembers that James Yen was a deserter during the War of Resistance, holding up "Ding County" as a guise, running to places like Brazil and Cuba to "promote mass education," and using the absurd remarks that slandered Chinese farmers as "ignorant, poor, selfish, and weak" to cater to the tastes of the ruling class, thereby swindling personal enjoyment.

One month after the "Bilateral Agreement" was signed, war criminal Wang Shijie and John Leighton Stuart unearthed this "Joint Plan," and added the more than 20 million U.S. dollars obtained from the spoils, signing an exchange of letters on August 5 of the same year to establish a "Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" to implement the plan. In addition to the sugar-coated clauses and the humiliating provisions common to all traitorous treaties, the specific conspiracies were as follows:

"A. In several provinces, select several counties to establish a coordinated and extensible plan on agriculture, family demonstration, and health education...

B. Consult with the Chinese government on the ways and methods to gradually implement various land reform measures.

C. Implement auxiliary programs on research, training, and manufacturing in appropriate locations to provide the plan with the necessary intelligence personnel and materials." (For the original text, see the Nanjing telegram of the pseudo-Central News Agency on August 5, 1948)

When this traitorous treaty was signed, Wang Shijie immediately delivered a "speech," saying that the establishment of this joint committee was due to "accepting the suggestions made by the U.S. side," and expressed that in the future, "a large number of educated youths will join the rural improvement work. Therefore, this plan is not only a rural work plan, but can also evolve into a rural leader talent training plan." (See the Nanjing telegram of the pseudo-Central News Agency on August 5, 1948)

What is the so-called "rural leader talent"? Why is it necessary to propose the "training" of "rural leader talent" at this time and place? It must be known that at that time, the Kuomintang bandit army was being beaten to a pulp in Kaifeng, and the "constitutional government" and "National Assembly" were in a complete mess. War criminal Wang Shijie dared not mention the conspiracy and ambition at all, but did not dare to mention it too explicitly. However, the low-energy pseudo-"Central News Agency," "Central Daily News," "North China Daily" and the like completely exposed it with glee. For example:

"At present, the communist bandits are in full rebellion, and the rural areas in the bandit-occupied areas are extremely dilapidated. In the future, when they are recovered in order, a set of restoration plans must be predetermined so that they can be immediately implemented in the recovered areas to start anew with the people. In the past, during the bandit suppression era in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, there was a set of methods for the recovered areas, among which education was particularly important. The education departments of each province had established a special education committee to deal with this issue. We hope to use the development of the work of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction as an opportunity to promote rural restoration work, so as to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion and lay the foundation for national construction." (See the editorial of the pseudo-North China Daily on August 16, 1948)

The conspiracies of U.S. Imperialism in the military, political, economic, and cultural aspects of China almost all adopt the same formula. For example, here, it uses the grand pretext of "rural reconstruction" as a disguise, and conspires to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang train rural special agents through this "training rural leaders" "plan," and from point to surface, engage in a set of "restoration plans, so that they can be immediately implemented in the recovered areas to start anew with the people." At the same time, it is also impatient to "consult with the Chinese government on the ways and methods to gradually implement various land reform measures." However, it still considers that the American-made "land reform" may not work in China. Therefore, it must "implement auxiliary programs on research, training, and manufacturing in appropriate locations to provide the plan with the necessary intelligence personnel and materials." It turns out that this so-called "rural reconstruction" work is another system of the special agent work of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization."

Soon after the exchange of letters, the "Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" was officially established in Nanjing at the original site of the former Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. There were five members, nominally two American and three Chinese. In fact, the checks were held in the hands of the Americans, and all Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang personnel acted according to their whims. The two American members were one named Muir, the head of the Far East Section of the Foreign Agricultural Relations Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and one named Bennett, who was an "expert on China" who had worked in mainland China for two or three decades under the guise of a water conservancy engineer. The three "members" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were Jiang Menglin, who was picked out of the political garbage heap, James Yen, who lived by selling out the motherland, and Shen Zonghan, a low-ranking politician in the agricultural world.

When this U.S. Imperialist conspiracy dared to be used against the Chinese people, the spearhead of the People's Liberation War was already pointing at Nanjing. Therefore, this small group of reactionaries immediately ran away and completely disintegrated.

However, the crimes and scandals of this "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" seem to be a case of "attempted crime," but we must not let go of the crimes of Austin, John Leighton Stuart, and others, because this is indeed a long-planned conspiracy. Facts have proved that the basic content of the so-called "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" is actually not the above-mentioned articles or nonsense, nor is it a "Yan's Plan" that was conveniently used by U.S. Imperialism. To understand this, please refer to the "confession" of the old fox John Leighton Stuart:

"U.S. Information Service Nanjing Telegram, August 5, 1948: Ambassador John Leighton Stuart issued the following statement on the 5th: ... One point that I am particularly satisfied with regarding the establishment of the committee (author's note: referring to the 'Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee') is that this move is the latest example of cooperation between China and the United States in this field, namely the Sino-American Joint Agricultural Mission in 1946 (note that the official Chinese sign of the mission was the 'Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group'). As far as I know, most of the materials and suggestions collected by the mission will be used as the basis for the work of the committee."

What is the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group"? No need to explain, when we see the words "Sino-American" combined with "cooperation," we are already gnashing our teeth! However, this is also done for "the benefit of Chinese farmers"!

II. The So-Called "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group"

The so-called "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" was, at the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the direction of warmonger Hurley, like other U.S. Imperialist delegations in the military and political fields, also an organization that came to China openly to carry out aggressive conspiracies under the name of a suggestion from the Kuomintang reactionary government. It included ten American "experts" and thirteen Chinese "experts." Among the so-called "experts" sent by U.S. Imperialism were Muir, the member of the "Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" introduced above, but here he appeared as "Deputy Leader and Secretary," and Bu Kai, a China expert who had done rural surveys in mainland China for more than 20 years with the dual identities of a missionary and an "agricultural expert," and was therefore valued by Wall Street. This was the first large-scale organization for U.S. Imperialism to engage in conspiracies against Chinese agriculture, so it again adopted its consistent disguise and said its mission was to "design a meticulous plan for improving Chinese agriculture." (See the introduction to the mission's report)

In June 1946, the mission officially began its activities. The members went to various important agricultural areas, especially the special product areas of tung oil, tea, silk, and wool, to conduct on-site investigations and collect information. Finally, they published a report of hundreds of thousands of words, titled "Ways to Improve Chinese Agriculture." The introduction to this special agent document blatantly stated: "When the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group concluded its work, it submitted a report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of China and President Truman of the United States. The report was published simultaneously in the two countries on February 24, 1947."

The Chinese version of the report was 24mo, totaling 326 pages, divided into 15 chapters. The first 11 chapters (1-176 pages) discussed agricultural policies, organizations, economics, etc. The last four chapters (177-296 pages) were: Improvement plans for tung oil, silk, tea, and wool. According to the mission, this was the only way to improve China's main agricultural products and Chinese agriculture.

As everyone knows, to improve China's agriculture, apart from the fundamental issue of land reform, the first step is to solve the problem of China's grain and cotton. This is already a basic common sense. But why, after "meticulous" "design," did the "experts" forget even this common sense? It is very obvious that these "experts" would rather forget their "humanity" than dare to forget the interests of their Wall Street masters. To maintain high profits, aren't the Wall Street tycoons dumping grain into the sea? How could they order the "experts" to come to China to suggest increasing grain production? The cotton area in the southern United States has a lot of cheap black labor. Relying on this low cost, American cotton can be produced in large quantities and can monopolize the world market. The raw material supply of China's cotton textile industry is especially controlled by it. When this cooperation group was conducting investigations in various parts of China, it was also the time when American cotton was being imported into China on an unprecedented scale. If U.S. Imperialism had actually proposed to China to improve the production of grain and cotton at that time, it would have been a strange thing!

Next, let's look at the first chapter, "Outline of Agricultural Construction Plan." In the "Economic and Social Aspects," it maliciously reverses the facts: "Farmers who have no place to stand are a major social problem in China, just like farmers in other countries who cannot cultivate the land. This problem is often exaggerated by people who lack evidence. About 30 percent of all cultivated land in China is tenanted... and pure tenant farmers account for less than one-quarter. Most fair landlords in China often assist their tenant farmers in engaging in good farming systems, and fairly share their expenses and income with the tenant farmers." (Page 20 of the original Chinese version)

Is this really just a representation of their stupidity? No, here, it just wants to collude with "the evil landlords in rural China" to more cruelly exploit "farmers who have no place to stand." Therefore, on the issue of how to improve the tenancy system, it only suggests so-called "partial corrections." (See the same page of the original Chinese version) However, it was already 1946-47, and the People's Liberation War had already launched a counter-offensive against the Kuomintang in a wide area, and the power of the liberated peasants after the land reform in the liberated areas was growing vigorously. It was both afraid and jealous, so a year later, when, as John Leighton Stuart claimed, "most of the materials and suggestions collected by the mission will be used as the basis for the work of the committee," this conspiracy further became to "consult with the Chinese government on the ways and methods to gradually implement various land reform measures" (source see the previous section). But this shameless conspiracy had not waited for it to "consult" with the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, and the powerful people's armed forces had quickly extinguished them. History proves that the growth of people's power is faster than the development of imperialist conspiracies.

Then, it said in a rogue and rascal tone: "Chinese women spend a lot of food, energy, and physical strength to raise groups of children who cannot grow up and develop unhealthy... Therefore, even if it is possible for China to increase the production of food and other agricultural products, if the rate of population growth is equal to the rate of agricultural production increase, there is still no hope for improving food nutrition." (Page 22 of the original Chinese version)

According to the opinions of these "experts," if the Chinese people want to "improve" their food and nutrition, they can only die quickly and women should not have children; if they can't do it, then they can only blame themselves for their bad luck and can only willingly be slaves and do the work of cattle and horses for American monopoly capitalists. Propagandists of the reactionary Malthusian theory have never been so mean and vulgar. In fact, only one year after the birth of the new China, there were records of bumper harvests and exports in food production, and the power of the people once again completely shattered the lies of the conspirators.

This is not to mention, let's take a look at the "technology" of the "Technology Cooperation Group." In the twelfth chapter, "The Current Situation and Development Path of China's Tung Oil Industry," it first stated that "Tung oil is an important raw material for manufacturing combat equipment, so the U.S. government has strictly controlled it when its domestic oil reserves gradually decrease, and it can only be used after approval." (Page 179 of the original Chinese version) Then it slowly revealed its true form: "In the most recent period, the tung oil that the United States can produce is only enough for a small part of its total industrial needs" (Page 181 of the original Chinese version). Therefore, it does not hesitate to use one-sixth of the entire book to exaggerate as much as possible that China must quickly strengthen tung planting, and even said without thinking: "It is currently difficult to implement the prepayment of goods. A possible alternative is to obtain a letter of credit from foreign importers when ordering goods, and settle the payment with the sea bill of lading." (Page 221 of the original Chinese version) - Is there a more "scientific and technical expert" in the world who can also do business like writing this "report"? It's simply the maggot of Wall Street!

Let's look at the fifteenth chapter, "China's Silk": After explaining the "world demand" in hundreds of words at the beginning, it then brazenly used the words "Allied Forces Headquarters Policy," which only appeared in the "report" of imperialist "experts," as the title, saying that it was necessary to "make Japan a country that provides a steady stream of raw silk to maintain the consumption of the occupying forces... However, there is very little cultivated land, and the food produced is not enough to meet the needs. How can its export of raw silk reach the highest output? The headquarters is considering it" (Page 228 of the original Chinese version). But on the other hand, "In the ten years from 1926 to 1935, the United States' raw silk consumption accounted for 15 percent of the world's raw silk exports (about 700,000 dan per year, each dan is 60 kilograms). After the Pearl Harbor incident, the supply of raw silk was suspended, and American textile manufacturers switched to using rayon to weave parachutes and other war-use silk" (Page 227 of the original Chinese version). In fact, everyone knows that rayon is used in the military because it has the disadvantages of being intolerant to high temperatures and easily causing chemical changes, and it cannot replace raw silk at all. However, the cunning shopkeeper still pretends: "Although the current demand for raw silk in the United States has shown a sharp decline, if the price of raw silk can maintain the pre-war level, that is, 3.5 U.S. dollars per pound, I believe that the United States still has a potential market for silk" (Page 230 of the original Chinese version). Therefore, "we respectfully suggest... silk merchants should choose one of the following two methods to maintain silk sales: 1. Silk merchants establish a marketing organization to specialize in the export of raw silk and silk fabrics, the quality of which must meet the needs of the United States, and store some inventory in the United States for supply; 2. Chinese exporters should use the Global Trading Corporation established by the Ministry of Finance in New York to sell Chinese silk products and purchase the machinery needed by China (author's note: that is, military supplies), and both parties do not aim to make profits, only charge a 2% handling fee" (Page 244-245 of the original Chinese version).

No need to analyze item by item, its conspiracy and sabotage have long been exposed on paper. However, it must be seriously pointed out that U.S. Imperialism is doing its best to advocate that China speed up the production of war materials that it lacks, and also wants to "store some of these war materials in the United States for supply." The Atlantic Charter had just been signed at that time, but the conspirators' conspiracies had already begun.

III. "For the Benefit of Chinese Farmers," We Must Resolutely Resist U.S. Imperialism

If we say that the conspiracy of U.S. Imperialism only began around the signing of the Atlantic Charter, that would be too contrary to historical views. For many years, Chinese farmers have experienced endless torment and disaster under the cruel conspiracies and sabotage of U.S. Imperialism.

When, as early as 1933, war criminal Song Ziwen signed the sinful "Sino-American Cotton and Wheat Loan" with U.S. Imperialism in order to continue to expand the anti-people civil war, it introduced a large amount of American wheat. It is said that the United States has always attached importance to the inspection of agricultural products import and export work. Aren't the agricultural products shipped by China often troubled or even returned in their original ships? But this time, for such a large batch of exported crops, after the "scientific inspection" that was so valued, a large batch of wheat blossom midges were夹进 like special agents were often夹带 in the diplomatic missions of U.S. Imperialism. This kind of insect had never been discovered in China at that time. It was a small gall midge. When the wheat was heading, it flew to lay eggs. The hatched larvae hid in the wheat ears, first eating the pollen, and then sucking the juice of the wheat grains. When the juice was sucked dry, the wheat grains became empty shells. Therefore, it first spread rampantly in the Jiangsu area where this batch of American wheat was planted, and the degree of harm was the most serious in Shaanxi, where the most was planted. Year after year, the wheat blossom midge disaster has spread to eight provinces and regions, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Ningxia. Taking this year's situation as an example, 23 counties in Shaanxi Province alone have been harmed by the wheat blossom midge, making farmers afraid to plant wheat. And the losses suffered, only in the three provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, the affected wheat fields reached more than 7.3 million mu. The serious ones reduced production by 70-80% per mu, even if it was lighter, but once it was affected, the harvest would be reduced by half. Generally, wheat fields produce an average of one shi of wheat per mu. If we calculate it by the minimum limit of a 50% reduction in production per mu, the wheat lost this year due to the harm of the U.S. Imperialist wheat blossom midge in the above-mentioned three provinces alone is more than 3.6 million shi; if we add up the total number of the above-mentioned eight provinces and the cumulative figures over the past ten years, what a heartbreaking "debt" it would be!

Would Chinese farmers forget such a heinous conspiracy lightly because of the passage of time? No, even a rogue act will be firmly remembered in our hearts. For example, when the Second World War was about to end, when the work of the so-called "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" began to prepare, the U.S. Imperialist bandits who handled this big deal were so mean and despicable as to disguise tens of thousands of tons of surplus vegetable seeds that had lost their germination power and were fundamentally unsuitable for cultivation in China, and shamelessly printed words such as suitable for planting in a certain area of China, and transported them in large quantities to various parts of China, and also vigorously touted the so-called "assistance to China's post-war recovery." But to this day, every Chinese farmer who has planted that batch of vegetable seeds can painfully recite the losses he has suffered and the contempt and hatred for U.S. Imperialism!

However, on such a sinful historical basis, the warmongers used the so-called "military mediation" means of the number one warmonger Marshall to the invasion of Chinese agriculture. Very obviously, U.S. Imperialism, on the one hand, extracted some bloody commercial profits and pretended to engage in "technical cooperation" and "rural reconstruction," and on the other hand, more cruelly used this to give cotton, tobacco, timber, miscellaneous grains, and other surplus agricultural products, like a flood, poured into China under the ever-changing names of "aid to China materials" and "special materials," manipulated prices, monopolized the market, and put the "reconstruction" of Chinese rural areas to death!

The years from 1946 to 1948, that is, the years when U.S. Imperialism repeatedly expressed "friendship" and "cooperation" to China's agriculture and rural areas, U.S. Imperialism used its privileges over the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to intensify and expand its aggressive forces against China's agricultural economy. There is conclusive evidence in the trade statistics of China's customs imports and exports:

Statistics of China's Imports of Major American Agricultural Products from 1946-1948

	1946	1947	1948
Cotton (market dan)	2,158,622	1,230,634	248,518
Tobacco (market jin)	23,789,230	36,681,844	18,291,254
Timber (cubic meters)	112,854	131,889	82,516

The numbers listed in the table above only refer to those three simple agricultural products. For example, "cotton" does not include cotton yarn waste, "tobacco" does not include tobacco silk cigarettes, and "timber" does not include sleepers and masts. Now, let's calculate the total value of imports to China in those years and compare it with the total value of all imports. - For the convenience of calculation and comparison, the "legal tender" and "gold yuan" of the value of goods have been uniformly converted into U.S. dollars according to the average exchange rate of each year.

Comparison Table of Total Value of American Imports to China and Total Value of All Imports from 1946-1948

	1946	1947	1948	(Unit: US dollars)
Total value of American imports	374,297,187	483,588,976	26,115,556
Total value of all imports	654,964,310	53,934,838,303	163,916
Percentage of American imports in total value of all imports	57.16	50.15	48.42

(Source of the above two tables: Monthly Report on China's Import and Export Trade from 1946-48)

It is worth explaining that, first, the "total value of all imports" listed in the table above includes more than 40 countries that have trade relations with China, including the United States, as well as the United Kingdom and Japan, which once ran rampant in the Chinese market.

Second, ten years ago, that is, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, when U.S. Imperialism also engaged in import and export trade with China like other countries, its position in the Chinese market was not prominent. Taking cotton, the most important American import over the years, as an example, it was 551,804 market dan in 1935, 188,322 market dan in 1936, and 49,432 market dan in 1937, with an average of only 262,919 market dan over three years. However, after the war, the three-year average from 1946 to 1948 reached 2,135,182 market dan, an increase of more than eight times. (Note: In the three-year average, in addition to the U.S. cotton imported by customs, U.S. cotton imported duty-free under the name of relief supplies is added. For details, see the next paragraph.)

Third, the data cited above only refers to those who have paid import tariffs and can be found in the records. As for those who have been imported duty-free under other names, they are not included in the statistics. But that more sinful number must be shocking, because according to the existing data, such as cotton, in 1946, as much as more than 1.26 million market dan were imported duty-free under the name of "relief supplies," accounting for 58 percent of the official imports by customs that year; it reached 1,513,874 market dan in 1947, accounting for more than 120 percent (relief supplies stopped in 1948); and in the tobacco category, the amount listed in the "aid to China materials" in 1948 reached 76 million market jin, exceeding the customs import by more than five times!

Fourth, judging from the customs statistics book alone, the import figures of American goods in 1948 seem to have declined slightly, but in fact, in that year, the "economic assistance" and "special assistance" of U.S. Imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, only the above-mentioned "bilateral agreement" item, reached 400 million U.S. dollars that were not included in the statistics.

Fifth, during that period, the trade relations between U.S. Imperialism and China were extremely abnormal, for example:

"Pseudo-Central News Agency, Washington Special Telegram, July 3, 1948: A U.S. State Department spokesman said... China must abolish the business restrictions that American businessmen in China are dissatisfied with."

"Pseudo-Central News Agency, Washington, United Press Telegram, July 3, 1948: Another section of the Sino-American agreement specifically stipulates that the exchange rate will be jointly determined by China and the United States..."

There must be many such sneaky behaviors, so even if the customs import procedures have been handled, it cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of the figures.

However, what is heartbreaking is that even if the information obtained under the special circumstances as mentioned above is enough to illustrate the intensity of the dumping of American goods that year and the severity of the disasters suffered by Chinese farmers. Everyone can recall that at that time, from cotton and cigarettes with the Calico trademark to apples and milk powder, they were all flooding the large and small markets in China. The prices of farmers' products were repeatedly lowered below the cost, but they still could not be sold. The same package of fine velvet cotton was actually more expensive than the American-shipped cotton from northern Jiangsu. Isn't this the "miracle" produced by "Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation"? Taking cotton as an example, in 1946, the cotton shipped from the United States alone (including duty-free U.S. cotton imported under the name of relief supplies) reached more than 3.4 million market dan, and the total value of imported cotton (including cotton imported from other countries, worth 404.52 million yuan in pseudo-legal currency at that time) was almost equal to the total value of all exported goods (412.11 million yuan in pseudo-legal currency), creating an unprecedentedly bad record in the history of China's foreign trade. Under such violent exploitation, the output of domestic agricultural products naturally dropped sharply. Taking tobacco as an example, in 1948, the national tobacco had a bumper harvest, with a yield of more than 360 million market jin. However, due to the collusion between U.S. Imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists to cruelly use means such as "monopoly" and "price limit" to dump American tobacco in large quantities and lower the price of national tobacco, creating man-made disasters, the yield in 1949 plummeted to 100 million market jin.

The conspiracy of the Marshall "peaceful mediation"-style "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" is so sharply reflected in the post-war agricultural economic structure of China, but this late-stage capitalist mode of aggression is very familiar to the Chinese people. Fifteen years ago, didn't the Japanese imperialists also adopt the same method and cunningly sang the tune of "industrial Japan, agricultural China"? The "suggestions" of the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" are just a rehash of this fallacy. Therefore, no matter how Austin confuses right and wrong, and even shamelessly says today that "millions and millions of Chinese people will never forget that in the difficult years after the war, they were able to have food, work, clothing, and travel, mostly because of American aid," millions and millions of Chinese people who have half a century of arduous struggle with imperialism have now fully understood an unshakeable truth under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, that is, "for the benefit of Chinese farmers," we must resolutely resist American imperialism!

    揭发美帝对中国农业上的阴谋与破坏
    华恕
    上月二十八日，联大安理会在讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾”案时，美帝驻该会常任代表奥斯汀发表冗长的谬论，重弹艾奇逊去年在“白皮书”里弹腻了的“中美人民友谊”的滥调，恬不知耻地说：“我的政府感到不快，我的政府鉴于中国人民与美国人民间有着长期的密切友谊，尤其不赞成这种攻讦。”接着掩耳盗铃地列举了一连串所谓“中美人民友谊”的“史实”，其中竟把美帝在战后企图对中国农业从事阴谋与破坏的“美中农村复兴联合计划”，说成“为了中国农民的利益”——战争贩子嘴里的“中国农民的利益”究竟代表着一些什么？历史是最好的雄辩，我们要沉痛地提出揭发和控诉。
    一、所谓“美中复兴农村联合计划”
    所谓“美中复兴农村联合计划”，实在就是美帝在中国经济侵略战线上最后也最惨的一场败仗。为了要挖根，不得不从所谓“马歇尔计划”的“中美双边协定”说起。
    “中美双边协定”是一九四八年七月，蒋匪帮在南京签定的无数卖国条约之一。其代价为美金四亿元，内分“经济援助”与“特种援助”两项。前者二亿七千五百万元，用以搞金圆券之类的勾当；后者一亿二千五百万元，则明目张胆地规定为购买军火，继续内战。而那笔二亿多美元的经济援助款项，却是拿一堆美帝剩余的食粮、棉花、石油、烟草、肥料及机械零件等来折价，用以撑持蒋匪军的军需与后勤和加紧对中国农业经济市场的掠夺。
    在历年美帝支持蒋匪帮打内战的所谓“援华”款项中，区区二亿余美元，早已算不了一回事，然而也许当时美帝的国务院就耽心到了奥斯汀今日在安理会上的窘势，不得不事先打下一个埋伏吧，还硬要在“协定”上拖个尾巴，注明从那二亿余美元的经济援助款项中，再抽出个十分之一来，从事“美中复兴农村联合计划”的实施。
    这一“美中复兴农村联合计划”的草拟，据说最初脱胎于农村教育界的国际骗子晏阳初搞的什么“晏氏计划”。谁都记得，晏阳初是抗战时期的逃兵，捧着个“定县”当幌子，跑到巴西古巴之类的地方去“推广平民教育”，而老一套地以侮蔑中国农民“愚贫私弱”的荒谬言论，去迎合统治阶级的胃口，从而骗取个人享受的家伙。
    “双边协定”签字之后一个月，战犯王世杰和司徒雷登便翻出这个“联合计划”，又配上由分脏所得的那两千多万美金，在同年八月五日签订了一个设立执行那计划的“农村复兴联合委员会”的换文。其中要点除糖衣般的条例和所有卖国条约中必有的丧权辱国的规定之外，其具体的阴谋有如下列：
    “甲、在若干省内，选择若干县，创办关于农业家庭示范卫生教育之一配合而具有推广性之计划………。
    乙、与中国政府咨商，关于逐步实施各项土地改革措施之途径及方法。
    丙、在适当地点实施关于研究训练及制造之辅助方案，借以供给该计划所需要之情报人员及物资。”（原文详见伪中央社一九四八年八月五日南京电）
    当这卖国条约签订的时候，王世杰曾即席发表“谈话”，他说这个联合委员会之成立，由于“接受美方所提之建议”，并表示今后要“使大量曾受教育之青年加入农村改进工作，因此，此一计划不仅为一农村工作之计划，并可演进为农村领袖人才训练之计划”。（见伪中央社一九四八年八月五日南京电）
    所谓“农村领袖人才”是什么呢？为什么硬要在此时此地提出“农村领袖人才”的“训练”来呢？必须知道，当时正是国民党匪军在开封被打得焦头烂额，“行宪”“国大”闹得一塌糊涂的时候，战犯王世杰既不敢把阴谋与野心一字不提，但又不敢把它提得过分露骨，可是低能的伪《中央社》《中央日报》《华北日报》之流，却得意忘形地给完全暴露出来了。例如：
    “现值共匪全面叛乱，陷匪区域，农村凋敝已极，将来次第收复，即不能不预定一套复兴的方案，以期在收复区立即实施，与民更始。过去豫鄂皖三省剿匪时代，对于收复区，均有一套办法，其中尤以教育为重要，各省教育厅即曾成立特种教育委员会，以处理这一问题。我们希望以中国农村复兴联委会工作开展为契机，来推进农村复兴工作，以加强戡乱力量，而奠定建国基础。”（见一九四八年八月十六日伪华北日报社论）
    美帝对中国军事、政治、经济、文化各方面的阴谋，几乎都采取同一的公式。譬如在这里，它以“农村复兴”的堂皇借口作伪装，而阴谋通过这一“训练农村领袖”的“计划”，去帮助蒋匪帮训练农村特务，并由点而面地搞一套“复兴方案，以期在收复区立即实施，与民更始”。同时又性急地要“与中国政府咨商，关于逐步实施各项土地改革措施之途径及方法”。不过，还算他顾虑得到，美国制的“土地改革”，在中国不见得行得通。所以必定要“在适当地点实施关于研究训练及制造之辅助方案，借以供给该计划所需要之情报人员及物资。”原来这所谓“农村复兴”的工作又是“中美合作所”的特务工作的另一系统。
    换文之后不久，“农村复兴联合委员会”便正式在南京前救济总署的原址成立了。委员五人，名义上美籍二人，中籍三人，事实上，支票抓在美国人手里，一切蒋匪帮人员都仰他们的鼻息行事。那两个美籍委员，一个叫穆懿尔，是美国农业部对外农业关系局远东科科长，一个叫毕范宇，是挂着个水利工程师的招牌，在中国内地混过二三十年的“中国通”。蒋匪帮的三个“委员”，一个是从政治垃圾堆里拣出来的蒋梦麟，一个为靠出卖祖国为生的晏阳初，一个是农业界的下流政客沈宗瀚。
    当这美帝的阴谋，居然敢于用来与中国人民为敌的时候，人民解放战争的矛头，已经指向南京。于是这一小撮的反动分子，便立刻拔腿而逃，全部瓦解了。
    不过，这一关于“美中复兴农村联合计划”的罪行和丑史，看来仿佛是一宗“未遂犯”的案件，但我们决不能把奥斯汀、司徒雷登之流的罪恶，就此放过，因为这实在是一件蓄意已久的阴谋。事实证明，所谓“美中复兴农村联合计划”的基本内容，实际上还不是上述的一些条文或谰言，更不是一个被美帝顺手利用了一下的什么“晏氏计划”，要了解这一点，请参看老狐狸司徒雷登的“供状”：
    “美国新闻处一九四八年八月五日南京电：司徒雷登大使五日发表声明如下：……本人对于该委员会（作者按：即指‘农村复兴联合委员会’）之成立尤感满意之一点，乃由于此举，为中美两国在该方面合作之最近实例之下，即为一九四六年间之中美联合农业代表团（按该团的正式中文招牌为‘中美农业技术合作团’）据本人所知，该代表团所搜集之材料及建议，大部分将被用作该委员会工作之基础。”
    什么叫做“中美农业技术合作团”呢？不必解释，当我们一看到“中美”两字之下，再加上一个“合作”时，早已咬牙切齿了！然而这又是所谓“为了中国农民的利益”而搞出来的呢！
    二、所谓“中美农业技术合作团”
    所谓“中美农业技术合作团”，是抗战刚刚结束的时候，在战争贩子赫尔利的导演下，跟其他军事政治之类的美帝代表团一样，也是用国民党反动政府建议的名义，公开到中国来进行侵略阴谋的组织之一。其中有美籍“专家”十人，中籍“专家”十三人。在美帝遣派的所谓“专家”内，则有上文介绍过的“农村复兴联合委员会”的委员穆懿尔，不过在这里他是以“副团长兼秘书”的姿态出现的，还有以传教士与“农业专家”双重身份在中国内地作过二十多年农村调查工作，并因而受到华尔街重视的中国通卜凯等等。这是美帝从事对中国农业阴谋的第一个庞大的组织，于是又采用一贯的伪装将其任务说成为“设计中国农业改进缜密之计划”。（见该团报告书绪言）
    一九四六年六月，该团正式开始活动，团员们分赴各重要农业地区，特别是桐油、茶叶、蚕丝、羊毛等特产区域，实地调查，搜集情报，最后刊布了一部洋洋数十万言的报告书，题为“改进中国农业之途径”。这部特务文献的引言上曾悍然地注明：“中美农业技术合作团于该团工作告终时，向中国蒋主席及美国杜鲁门总统呈递一份报告书，该报告书于一九四七年二月二十四日在两国同时公布。”
    报告书中文版为二十四开本共三百二十六页，内分一十五篇，前十一篇（一——一七六页）论农业的政策、组织、经济等等，后四篇（一七七——二九六页）则为：桐油、蚕丝、茶叶和羊毛的改进计划。据该代表团的说法，这就是改进中国主要的农产品和中国农业的唯一途径。
    众所周知，要改进中国的农业，除了土地改革这一个根本问题不谈外，第一要从解决中国的粮食与棉花问题着手。这已经是一种起码的常识了。但是为什么在经过了“缜密”的“设计”之后，“专家”们竟会连这点常识也给忘掉的呢？非常明显，这批“专家”们，是宁肯忘掉自己的“人性”，却不敢忘掉华尔街主子的利益的。为了维持高额的利润，华尔街的财阀们不正在把粮食往海里倒吗？他怎会命令“专家”们还到中国来建议增产粮食？美国南部的棉区，有的是廉价的黑人劳动力，就依靠着这低廉的成本，美国棉花可以大量生产，可以垄断全世界的市场，中国棉纺织业的原料供应，尤其控制在它的手里。当这个合作团在中国各地进行调查的时候，也正是美国棉花对中国空前大量地输进的时候，假若当时美帝竟会提出要中国改进粮食与棉花的生产的建议来，那才真是怪事！
    接着，且看第一章“农业建设计划概要”，其中“经济与社会方面”，是这样恶毒地颠倒事实的：“身无立椎之地之农人，为中国一大社会问题，犹如其他各国农人之不能率地而耕者，亦比比皆是也，但此一问题，每为缺乏根据之人士，夸大过甚。中国所有耕地约有百分之三十为出佃者……而纯粹佃农则占四分之一弱。中国多数公正地主，常能协助其佃农从事良好之耕作制度，并与佃农公允分摊其开支与收入。”（原书中文版二十页）
    这话果真只是代表着他们的愚蠢吗？不，在这里，他只是想用以勾结“中国农村的恶霸地主”，一齐来更残酷地压榨“身无立椎之地之农人”而已。因此，对如何改进租佃制度的问题，还只建议作所谓“局部改正”。（见原书中文版页同上）然而，那时已是一九四六——四七年，人民解放战争已在广大的地区主动地向国民党发动反攻，而解放区土改后翻身农民的力量，正在蓬勃地成长。它又害怕又嫉恨，因此一年之后，待到如司徒雷登所称“该代表团所搜集之材料及建议，大部分将被用作该委员会工作之基础”时，这一阴谋，则又更进一步地变成要“与中国政府咨商，关于逐步实施各项土地改革措施之途径及方法”了（来源见上节）。但这一无耻的阴谋，还没等到它与蒋匪帮反动政府“咨商”，强大的人民武装，就已迅速地将它们扑灭。历史证明，人民力量的成长，是更快地超越了帝国主义阴谋的发展。
    跟着，它更以流氓无赖的口吻说：“中国妇女耗费大量食物、精神与体力，养育不能长大成人与发育不健全之成群儿女……故中国对于食粮及其他农产品之增产，纵有可能，但如人口之增殖与农业生产之增加速率相等，则其食物营养固仍无改善之望也。”（原书中文版第二十二页）
    照这批“专家”的意见，中国的人民假若要想“改善”其食物与营养，就只有活的赶快死，女的不要生育；如果办不到，那就只好怪自己命苦，只能甘心情愿地做奴隶，做美国独占资本家的牛马。宣传反动的马尔萨斯论者，从没有刻薄与下流到如此地步的。而实际的情况，却是新中国的诞生才一年光景，粮食生产方面，就有了丰收与出口的纪录，人民的力量，又一次地完全粉碎了阴谋家的谎言。
    这还不论，再来看看“技术合作团”的“技术”罢。在第十二篇“中国桐油事业现状及其发展途径”中，首先只是表示“桐油为制造作战器材重要原料，故美国政府于其国内存油逐渐减少时，加以严密之管制，须经核准之后，始可利用”。（原书中文版第一七九页）然后慢慢露出原形：“在最近期间，美国所能生产之桐油，仅足供其全部工业所需之一小部分而己”（原书中文版第一八一页）。因此不惜以全书六分之一的篇幅，来尽量夸大中国必须快快加强植桐，甚至急不择言地说：“预付货款一层，目前实行尚属困难，可能之变通办法，即于定货时向国外进口商取得押汇信用状，凭海轮提单结清货款”。（原书中文版第二二一页）——世界上还有比写这种“报告书”的更会兼做买卖的“科学技术专家”么？简直是华尔街的蛆！
    再看第十五篇“中国的蚕丝”：在开始以数百字说明“世界需要量”之后，接着便赫然以“盟军统帅总部政策”这类只有帝国主义的“专家”“报告书”上才会出现的字眼做标题，内容说是要“使日本成为源源供给生丝之国家，以维持占领军之消费……惟耕地甚少，所产食粮尚且不敷需要，其出口生丝如何方能使达最高产量，统帅总部正在考虑中”（原书中文版二二八页）。但另一方面，“自一九二六年至一九三五年之十年中，美国生丝消费是占全世界出口生丝量百分之十五（每年约七十万担，每担合六十公斤），珍珠港事变后，生丝供应停顿，美国纺织厂商改用人造丝织造降落伞及其他战争用丝绸”（原书中文版二二七页）。事实上谁都知道，人造丝用之于军事，因其具有不耐高温与容易起化学变化等缺点，根本不能替代生丝。然而狡猾的市侩却还要装腔作势：“现美国对生丝之需要量虽呈锐减之势，但如生丝价格能维持战前水准，即每磅美金三元五角，相信美国仍有销纳丝绸之潜在市场”（原书中文版二三○页）。因此“同人等谨建议……蚕丝当业者应就下列两种办法中采择一端，以维持丝销：一、丝商成立推销机构，专办生丝及绸缎外销事宜，其质量均须适合美国之需要，并预储一部存货于美国以资供应；二、中国出口商应利用财政部设在纽约之环球贸易公司出售中国丝类货品，购买中国需要之机器（作者按：即军火），双方不以营利为目的，仅收百分之二手续费”（原书中文版二四四——二四五页）。
    不必逐项分析，其阴谋破坏，早已暴露在纸上。然而必须严重指出，美帝之极力主张中国加紧增产的尽是些它所缺乏的战争原料，而且还想把这些战争原料“预储一部存货于美国，以资供应”，当时大西洋宪章还刚刚签订，但战争贩子们的阴谋便早已开始了。
    三、“为了中国农民的利益”，必须坚决抵抗美帝
    如果说美帝的阴谋只是开始在大西洋宪章签订的前后，那还是太违背历史的看法。多少年了，中国农民在美帝残酷的阴谋与破坏下，经历着无尽的折磨与灾难。
    当远在一九三三年，战犯宋子文为继续扩大反人民的内战而与美帝签订了罪恶的“中美棉麦贷款”的时候，曾因而引进了大量的美国小麦。据说美国是素来重视农产品进出口的检验工作的，中国运去的农产品，不是经常受到麻烦，甚至被原货原船退回吗？可是这一次对于这么一大批出口的农作物，却在经过那索来被重视的“科学检验”之后，像美帝的外交使团中惯于夹带特务一样地夹进了一大批的吸浆虫。这种虫，当时中国还从来没发现过，那是一种细小的瘿蝇，当麦子抽穗的时候，飞来产卵，孵化出来的幼虫便躲在麦穗里，先吃花粉，然后吸吮麦粒的浆汁，浆汁吸光，麦粒乃成空壳。于是，最初在种植了这批美国小麦的江苏一带，便首先蔓延猖獗，而种植得最多的陕西，为害的程度也最为严重。年复一年，到今天小麦吸浆虫灾已遍布江苏、安徽、河南、陕西、山西、湖南、湖北及宁夏等八个省区，仅以今年的情况为例，陕西一省就有二十三个县遭受吸浆虫的为害，闹得农民不敢种植小麦。而所受的损失，只讲河南、江苏、安徽三省，被害的麦田即达七百三十多万亩，严重的每亩减产百分之七八十，纵令较轻，但一经遭受，收成便要减半。一般麦田，平均每亩产麦一石，以最低限度每亩因之减产百分之五十计，仅上述三省，今年因美帝吸浆虫之为害所损失的小麦，就有三百六十多万石；若以上列八省总计，并加上这十多年来的累积数字，又该是多么痛心的一笔“债”！
    这类万恶的阴谋，中国的农民们会因为时间久了，便轻轻忘记掉的么？不，即使是一件流氓的行径，也会牢牢地记在我们的心里。例如当第二次大战快要结束，所谓“联合国救济总署”的工作开始准备的时候，经办这一笔大买卖的美帝匪徒，竟卑鄙下流到把若干万吨失掉了发芽力和根本不适于中国栽培的过剩的蔬菜种子加以伪装，并无耻地印上适于中国某某地带种植的字样，大量地运到中国各地，还极力标榜所谓“协助中国的战后复兴”。可是到今天，每一个种植过那批蔬菜种子的中国农民们，都能痛心地背出他所因而遭受到的损失与对美帝的鄙视和痛恨！
    可是，战争贩子们，就在那样罪恶的历史基础上，以头号战争贩子马歇尔的所谓“军事调处”的手段，用到对中国农业的侵略上来。非常明显的，美帝一面抽出点血腥的商业利润，装模作样地来搞“技术合作”“农村复兴”，另一面却是更狠心地借此以“援华物资”“特种物资”等千变万化的名义，给棉花、烟草、木材、杂粮等剩余农产品，像洪水似地涌进中国，操纵物价，垄断市场，置中国农村“复兴”于死地！
    一九四六到一九四八的那几年，也就是美帝对中国的农业与农村一再表示“友谊”与“合作”的那几年，美帝利用其对蒋匪帮的特权，加紧扩大其对中国农业经济侵略的势力。在中国海关进出口的贸易统计上，有如下的铁证：
    一九四六——四八年中国进口美国主要农产品统计表
    一九四六   一九四七  一九四八
    棉花（市担）  二、一五八、六二二  一、二三○、六三四  二四八、五一八
    烟叶（市斤） 二三、七八九、二三○ 三六、六八一、八四四  一八、二九一、二五四
    木材（立方公尺）  一一二、八五四  一三一、八八九  八二、五一六
    上表所列数字，仅指那三项单纯的农产品而言，如“棉花”中不包括棉纱废花，“烟叶”中不包括烟丝卷烟，“木材”中不包括枕木桅杆等等。现再将那几年对中国进口货的总值计算下来与全部进口货的总值作一比较。——为了便于计算与对照起见，已将货品价值的“法币”和“金圆券”已依据各该年的平均汇率，一律折成了美金。
    一九四六——四八年中国进口美货与全部进口货总值比较表
    一九四六  一九四七  一九四八（单位：美元）
    美帝进口货总值  三七四、二九七、  四八三、五八八、  二六、一一五、五五六  一八七  九七六
    全部进口货总值  六五四、九六四、三一○、五三、九三四、八三八、三○三   一六三  九一六
    美帝进口货占全部进口货总  五七·一六  五○·一五  四八·四二
    值的百分比
    （以上二表资料来源：一九四六——四八年中国进出口贸易统计月报）
    值得说明的，第一，在上表所列“全部进口货”中，包括与中国发生贸易关系的四十多个国家，其中有美国也有曾在中国市场上一度横行的英国、日本等。
    第二，十年前，也就是抗战以前，当美帝也和其他国家一样与中国做进出口贸易的时候，它在中国市场的地位是并不突出的。即以历年美货进口最主要的棉花为例，一九三五为五五一、八○四市担，一九三六为一八八、三二二市担，一九三七为四九、四三二市担，三年平均仅二六二、九一九市担，但战后，自一九四六到一九四八的三年平均却达二、一三五、一八二市担，猛然提高了八倍以上。（按：三年平均数中，除海关进口美棉外，另加以救济物资名义免税进口之美棉，数字详下段。）
    第三，以上所引资料还是仅指缴纳了进口关税，有案可查的而已，至于以其他名义，漏税进口的，尚未统计在内。可是那一部分更罪恶的数字一定足以惊人，因为暂据已有资料所知，如棉花一项，一九四六年以“救济物资”名义免税进口的即达一百二十六万余市担，占是年海关正式进口数的百分之五十八；一九四七年达一、五一三、八七四市担，占百分之一百二十以上（一九四八年救济物资停止）；而烟草一项，一九四八年“援华物资”中之所列达七千六百万市斤，竟超过海关进口数的五倍以上！
    第四，单从海关统计册上看来，一九四八年美货的进口数字，似乎略有降落，但事实上那一年美帝对蒋匪帮的“经济援助”与“特种援助”，仅本文上述“双边协定”一项，就达四亿美元没有统计在内。
    第五，美帝在那一段时期中，对中国的贸易关系是极不正常的，譬如：
    “伪中央社一九四八年七月三日华盛顿专电：美国务院发言人谈………在华美国商人所不满意之商务限制，中国亦须予以废止”。
    “伪中央社华盛顿一九四八年七月三日合众社电：中美协定中另一节特别规定，即为中美双方共同决定外汇率……。”
    像这一类鬼鬼祟祟的行为，必然很多，因此即使是办过海关进口手续的，也还不能保证其数字的完全正确。
    然而，令人痛心的是，纵令其在如上所说的特种情况下所获得的资料，已足够说明当年美货倾销的猛烈，和中国农民所遭受的灾难的严重。谁都能回想到，那时候从花旗商标的棉花、香烟、到苹果、奶粉，无不充斥着中国的大小市场。农民给产品一再压低到成本以下的价格，还是卖不出去。同样一包细绒棉，苏北产的竟比美国运来的还贵，这岂不是“中美农业技术合作”中所产生的“奇迹”么？如以棉花为例，一九四六年单讲美帝运来的棉花（包括救济物资中的免税进口美棉）即达三百四十余万市担，而进口棉花一项的总价值（包括其他各国进口棉花，共值当时伪法币四○四五二万元）则几乎与全部出口货的总价值（伪法币四一二一一万元）相等，造成中国对外贸易史上空前恶劣的纪录。在这样暴力的压榨下，国内农产品的产量，当然急剧地降落。如再以烟叶为例，一九四八年，国烟丰收，产量为三亿六千多万市斤，但由于美帝串通国民党官僚资本家残酷地利用“专卖”“限价”等手段，大量倾销美烟，压低国烟价格，造成人为的灾难，到一九四九年时，产量便猛烈地跌到一亿市斤。
    马歇尔“和平调处”式的“美中复兴农村联合计划”的阴谋，是这样尖锐地反映在战后中国的农业经济形态上，但这种资本主义末期的侵略方式，对于中国人民却是非常熟悉的。十五年前日本帝国主义者不也是采取同样的手法，狡滑地高唱过什么“工业日本，农业中国”吗？所谓“中美农业技术合作团”的那批“建议”，也只是这一谬论的翻版而已。因此，不论奥斯汀怎样混淆是非，甚至到今天还在无耻地说什么“千千万万的中国人决忘不了，在大战以后的困难岁月中，他们所以能有饭吃、有工作、有衣穿、能旅行，大部是由于有了美国援助的缘故。”有着半世纪与帝国主义艰苦斗争的经验的千千万万的中国人民，现在已经在中国共产党的正确领导下，完全懂得了一个颠扑不破的真理，那就是“为了中国农民的利益”，必须坚决地抵抗美国帝国主义！
