    Peking Union Medical College Faculty and Students
    Oppose U.S. Imperialist's Shameless Slanders
    Zhang Xijun, Professor and Head of the Department of Physiology at Peking Union Medical College, said: "Austin's words are an admission of U.S. imperialism's cultural aggression against China without being forced to confess." Zhou Jinhuang, Professor and Head of the Department of Pharmacology, said: "We will never be麻醉 (má zuì - anesthetized or lulled, the translation depends on the context) by these petty favors; it (U.S. imperialism) is attempting to deceive the kind people of China and the United States." Dr. Deng Jiadong said: "No matter what Austin says, imperialism is still imperialism; we must oppose it to the end!" In addition, the students also expressed their protests. The fire of anger is burning in the hearts of every Peking Union Medical College student. (Peking Union Medical College Correspondent Group)

    反对美帝无耻诬蔑
    北京协和医学院生理科主任教授张锡钧说：“奥斯汀的话，是把美帝对中国的文化侵略不打自招了。”药理科主任教授周金黄说：“我们决不被这些小恩小惠所麻醉，它（美帝国主义分子）是企图欺骗中国与美国善良的人民。”邓家栋大夫说：“任凭奥斯汀怎样说，帝国主义还是帝国主义，我们要反对到底！”此外，同学们也纷纷表示抗议。愤怒的火正燃烧在每一个协和同学的心里。（协和医学院通讯组）
