    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: The dying Li Seung-man gang, under the direction and cover of the American aggressors and their tool of aggression in Korea, the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," is frantically carrying out a barbaric and bloody massacre of the Korean people. According to a dispatch from the United Press in Seoul on the 16th, an official of the Li Seung-man puppet government admitted that on December 11th alone, 578 people, including women and children, were collectively massacred in the northern suburbs of Seoul. A "United Nations Commission source" admitted that another 200 people were collectively massacred on the 15th. This collective massacre is still ongoing.

    The Li Seung-man gang's bestial atrocities of mass murder have even led soldiers of the British accomplice army in Korea, who witnessed these atrocities, to consider them "disgustingly cruel." According to Reuters and the Associated Press: British soldiers stationed near "Execution Hill" outside Seoul have continuously heard and witnessed the collective massacres carried out by the Li Seung-man gang for several days. On the morning of December 16th, near the base of the British Northumberland Infantry Regiment, 34 "prisoners" were collectively massacred "without any specific charges being announced." Among them were two women and two children. One child was about thirteen or fourteen years old, and the other was about eight years old. The Li Seung-man troops transported these "prisoners" in trucks to the edge of a trench dug the day before. They were tied together in pairs. The Li bandits arranged them in piles of ten, pushed them into the trench, forced them to kneel inside, and then shot them in the back and head. British ordnance sergeant Brown, who witnessed the massacre, said, "It's disgustingly cruel. ... The youngest was a boy of about eight, kneeling in the trench crying, waiting to be shot. ... The (Li Seung-man) guard cursed at him and told him to turn his face away, and then shot him." British clerk Hield said: "Later, they piled dirt on the bodies and left. When I went back to look in the afternoon, I saw a leg sticking out of a mound." Hield said: He saw several Americans present when the massacre took place.

    This bloody massacre of the Korean people by the American-Li bandits began when they fled from northern Korea. According to an Associated Press reporter accompanying the British army, the British army saw traces of massacres all along the way as they fled south from Pyongyang. Next to the Li bandit police station in Sinmak, they "found a large grave. Beneath a thin layer of freshly dug topsoil, lay the bodies of more than fifty Koreans. Some of the bodies were riddled with bullet holes."

    Such cruel and bloody massacres carried out by the Li Seung-man gang under the direction of the American and British aggressors have aroused great resentment even among some soldiers and junior officers of the British accomplice army in Korea. Although these British soldiers, deceived and blinded by the imperialists, still believe that they came to Korea to "fight against the communist aggression," they also stated that they would never allow these atrocities. Reuters helplessly admitted that British soldiers, "partly because of the massacres they saw, and partly because of the discouraging military situation, have never expressed their war-weariness so openly as they did tonight (the 16th)." "A sergeant in the Northumberland Infantry Regiment said: I left my wife and two children to come here, what for?" A British junior officer said: "I am unwilling to further encourage my soldiers to risk their lives to defend a cause that is, to say the least, very questionable." Some British soldiers also said, "Why should we come to this godforsaken place to fight for these bastards?"

    The British aggressors were deeply alarmed by the discontent among British soldiers caused by the open massacre atrocities of the American-Li bandits. British Minister to Seoul, Adams, requested the American Embassy, the instigator of the atrocities, on the 18th to "use its influence to prevent the Korean authorities (referring to the Li Seung-man puppet government) from executing prisoners in places visible to the British army." However, the eight British soldiers guarding near the execution ground were "ordered to leave and not to interfere with the execution on the following morning."

    美李匪帮残杀朝鲜人民  引起侵朝英兵厌战情绪
    【新华社二十日讯】垂死的李承晚匪帮在美国侵略者及其侵朝工具所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的指使与掩护下，正疯狂地对朝鲜人民进行野蛮的血腥屠杀。据合众社汉城十六日电透露，李承晚傀儡政府的一个官员承认：在十二月十一日一天中，在汉城北郊就有五百七十八名包括若干妇女与儿童被集体屠杀。一个“联合国委员会人士”承认：十五日又有两百人被集体屠杀。这种集体屠杀还在继续进行中。
    李承晚匪帮这种大批屠杀的兽行，连目睹这些暴行的侵朝的英国帮凶军队的士兵也认为“令人恶心地残酷”。据路透社与合众社透露：驻在汉城郊外“刑场山”附近的英国士兵，在接连几天当中不断听到而且亲眼看到李承晚匪帮所进行的集体屠杀。十二月十六日清晨，在英军诺森伯兰步兵团驻地的近旁，有三十四个“没有宣布任何具体罪状”的“犯人”被集体屠杀。其中有两个妇女，两个儿童。一个儿童大约十三四岁，一个儿童大约八岁。李承晚匪军把这批“犯人”用卡车运到前一天掘好的壕沟边。他们每两个人被缚在一起。李匪军把他们每十个人弄成一堆，推进壕沟里，迫使他们跪在里面，然后向他们的背上和头上开枪。目睹这次屠杀的英军军需中士勃朗说：“这真是令人恶心地残酷。……年纪最小的一个是大约八岁的男孩子，他跪在壕沟里哭，等着被枪毙，……（李匪军）卫兵咒骂他叫他转过脸去，然后就枪毙了他。”英军文书希尔德说：“后来，他们在尸体上堆了土，就走开了。下午我再去看时，看见一个坟堆中伸出了一条腿。”希尔德说：屠杀进行时，他看见有几个美国人在场。
    美李匪军对朝鲜人民的这种血腥屠杀，在他们从朝鲜北部溃逃时就开始了。据合众社随英军记者泄露：英军从平壤向南溃逃途中，沿途都看到了屠杀的痕迹。他们在新幕的李匪帮警察局旁边就曾“发现一座大坟。在薄薄的一层新掘出的浮土下面，埋着五十多个朝鲜人的尸体。有些尸体上面满是子弹的枪洞”。
    李承晚匪帮在美英侵略者指使下所进行的如此残酷的血腥屠杀，甚至在侵朝的英国帮凶军队的若干士兵与下级军官中，也引起了很大的反感。尽管这些受帝国主义者欺骗蒙蔽的英国士兵还认为他们到朝鲜是“和共产党侵略作战”，但他们也表示绝不容许这些暴行。路透社无可奈何地承认：英军士兵“一方面由于他们看到的屠杀，一方面由于使人丧气的军事局势。他们从没有像今（十六日）晚这样公开地表示厌战”。“诺森伯兰步兵团的一个中士说：我离开了我的妻子和两个孩子到这来，这是为了什么呢？”英军一个下级军官说：“我不愿意再鼓励我的士兵冒生命的危险去捍卫一种至少可以说是很成问题的事业”。还有一些英军士兵说：“我们干什么要到这种鬼地方来替这些王八旦打仗呢？”
    英国侵略者对于美李匪帮公开的屠杀暴行引起了英军士兵的不满，甚感恐慌。英国驻汉城公使阿丹姆斯十八日要求暴行的主使者美国大使馆“运用其影响，使朝鲜当局（指李承晚傀儡政府）不要在英国军队看得见的地方处决囚犯”。但是，就在刑场附近警戒的八个英国士兵却“奉命离开，不要干涉第二天早晨的执刑”。
