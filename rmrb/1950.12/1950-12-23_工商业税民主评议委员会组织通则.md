    Article 1 These regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Taxes.
    Article 2 All cities that collect industrial and commercial taxes through democratic appraisal methods must organize a Democratic Appraisal Committee for Industrial and Commercial Taxes (hereinafter referred to as the "DAC") in accordance with these regulations.
    Article 3 The tasks of the DAC are as follows:
    1. To convey the tax policies and decrees of the People's Government;
    2. To urge industrial and commercial households to report their business volume and income, expose false accounting, and report false declarations;
    3. To assess the business volume and income of industrial and commercial households, and submit them to the tax authorities for calculation of tax amounts according to rates;
    4. To accept applications for objections to democratic appraisals; to re-appraise unfair appraisals in various industries;
    5. To assist the tax authorities in urging industrial and commercial households to fulfill their tax obligations.
    Article 4 The organization of the DAC shall be divided into the following three levels:
    1. City (County) Joint Democratic Appraisal Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Joint DAC").
    2. Industry-Specific Democratic Appraisal Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Specific DAC").
    3. Democratic Appraisal Group.
    For industries with a large number of households, a regional appraisal committee for that industry may be established under the Specific DAC at its discretion.
    Article 5 The Joint DAC is under the leadership of the local People's Government and handles joint appraisal matters of industrial and commercial taxes in various industries. The number of committee members shall be determined by the People's Government according to the number of industries and households. Its composition is as follows:
    1. Ex officio members—representatives of tax authorities, industrial and commercial administration authorities, and federations of industry and commerce.
    2. Elected members—representatives elected by various industries.
    3. Invited members—fair-minded individuals from the industrial and commercial sectors invited by the local People's Government.
    The Joint DAC shall have one director and one to two deputy directors, designated by the local People's Government from among the members of the Joint DAC. Several standing committee members shall be elected from among all members. When necessary, the Joint DAC may work in groups.
    Article 6 The Specific DAC is under the leadership of the Joint DAC and handles the specific appraisal matters of industrial and commercial taxes in each industry. Its composition is as follows:
    1. The number of members of the Specific DAC shall be determined by the Joint DAC. In addition to the representatives of the tax authorities, representatives of trade associations, and members of that industry participating in the Joint DAC being ex officio members, the remaining members shall be democratically elected by the industry from large, medium, and small businesses, from bottom to top, and reported to the Joint DAC for record.
    2. The Specific DAC shall have one director and one to two deputy directors, designated by the Joint DAC.
    The composition of the regional appraisal committee shall apply the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs.
    Article 7 The appraisal group is under the leadership of the Specific DAC and directly handles the appraisal of industrial and commercial taxes for the households in its group. Each group shall have one chief and one deputy chief, elected by the households in the group and approved by the Specific DAC.
    Article 8 When the Joint DAC or Specific DAC holds meetings, it may invite representatives designated by relevant trade unions and other organizations to participate.
    Article 9 If a member of the Joint DAC, Specific DAC, or a group leader is found to be engaging in favoritism, malpractice, or unfair practices, anyone may report it. If the investigation confirms the report, their position as a member or group leader shall be revoked, and a new election shall be held.
    Article 10 The DAC may request the tax authorities to directly assess the tax amount of industrial and commercial households that cannot be appraised, and notify the taxpayers to pay.
    Article 11 If an industrial and commercial household has objections to the assessed or determined tax amount, it may apply to the DAC and the tax authorities for reconsideration. If it is still dissatisfied after reconsideration, it may appeal to the higher-level tax authorities.
    If the applicant is still dissatisfied with the reconsideration in cities with a Tax Reconsideration Committee, they may apply to the Reconsideration Committee for reconsideration. The committee may offer opinions and submit them to the tax authorities or the DAC for verification. If the applicant is still dissatisfied, they may still appeal to the higher-level tax authorities.
    Article 12 After each appraisal work of industrial and commercial taxes is completed, the DAC shall be announced as dissolved by the local People's Government. If there is a need for continued existence, it may be extended.
    Article 13 The appraisal of fixed-period and fixed-amount taxes in various cities may be handled with reference to the provisions of these regulations.
    Article 14 These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.
