On the Journey to Moscow
    Sun Weishi

    Invited by the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, led a Chinese youth delegation to Moscow on October 20th for a visit. Accompanying the delegation was the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, which had been visiting China for forty days. Now, excerpts from the diary along the way are sent to readers in the country who care about the delegation.

    October 23rd

    After leaving Manzhouli, the train sped across the snow-covered plains. Soon, we saw a tall stone monument, which was the border. Goodbye, dear motherland, we bid you farewell temporarily with boundless love.

    Our trip is to consolidate and develop the friendship between the youths of China and the Soviet Union and to learn from the work experience of Soviet youth in building their motherland and the Leninist Young Communist League. Although it is not my first time going to Moscow, I am as excited as the comrades who are going to Moscow for the first time.

    The train quickly arrived at Otpor, the first small station on the Soviet border. Here, we transferred to a Soviet train. We were placed in clean and beautiful sleeping cars, each room with snow-white sheets, blue curtains, red table lamps, and bright mirrors. After settling down, we were first invited to the dining car for a meal. The girls in the dining car who served us wore white aprons and white flower knots on their heads, smiling at us. Here, no one feels the language barrier. Everyone smiles and talks intimately, gesturing as if we have known each other for a long time. The dinner was rich, with all kinds of dishes, wines, and fresh fruits. Semi-chasny, one of the secretaries of the Soviet Young Communist League, was still a guest in China yesterday and is now our gracious host. We constantly toasted to the health of Stalin and Chairman Mao and to the friendship between the youths of China and the Soviet Union. The director of the dining car, a man of about forty years old, told us that when Chairman Mao went to Moscow, he was assigned to do reception work. When he talked about seeing Chairman Mao, he was both happy and proud.

    At night, we slept in warm and comfortable beds, feeling somewhat tired but too excited to fall asleep. Tomorrow we will arrive in Chita. In the era of Pushkin in the nineteenth century, Chita was a village of one hundred wooden houses and the place where the Decembrists were exiled. The wives of the Decembrists followed their suffering husbands, enduring all kinds of hardships, walking from distant Petersburg to Chita. The place where they lived was later called "Women's Street." At that time, it was unprecedented for women to come to Chita from Petersburg. Now, Chita is a large city in eastern Siberia and an important transportation hub. Soviet women have long become the masters here.

    October 24th

    From afar, we heard the sound of music. As the train pulled into Chita station, we saw a sea of people. Young men and women holding flowers rushed towards the train as it was about to stop. Policemen held hands to form a line, blocking the welcomers rushing towards the train, making way for the representatives. The secretary of the Chita Oblast Committee of the Communist Youth League, the secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and responsible comrades of the Youth League all came to the station to welcome us. As soon as we got off the train, the welcomers cheered loudly, and countless hands stretched out to shake hands with us. Some policemen were so excited that they forgot to maintain order and shook hands with us. Some people took the opportunity to hug and kiss our representatives. A welcome rally for the Chinese youth delegation to the Soviet Union and the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation began right next to the train. After the meeting, we bid farewell to the youth of Chita. They once again shook hands and embraced us warmly and presented us with various gifts. Some gave books, some gave notebooks, and some gave commemorative badges. Our female combat hero, Guo Junqing, received more than forty different commemorative badges at this welcome meeting. A girl gave her own photo. Some people who didn't bring gifts gave their eyeglass cases as gifts. Members of the Young Pioneers took off their red scarves and put them on our necks. They said, "Mao Zedong passed by here, and we gave him our red scarves. Sisters and uncles, please tell our beloved Mao Zedong that the Young Pioneers of Chita send him their greetings." In the sound of music, we boarded the train, each with a red scarf on our necks. Labor model Tian Guiying put on seven or eight of them. The youths and children of Chita raised thousands of enthusiastic hands to bid us farewell. This sincere friendship deeply moved us. The Soviet people love their motherland, and they also love the Chinese people who stand shoulder to shoulder with them to defend peace. This education of patriotism and internationalism is cultivated from childhood. The train started moving. Comrade Feng Wenbin stood at the door of the train and shouted to them, "Long live the friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union!" Then, a thunderous cheer resounded below. Chita station was no longer visible, but the enthusiastic cheers could still be faintly heard.

    October 25th

    The train is now running along the shores of Lake Baikal. Lake Baikal is the world's largest freshwater lake. The sun shines on the rippling lake water, and it looks like an endless ocean at a glance. The train's radio is also broadcasting "Song of Lake Baikal." Semi-chasny told us that the Baikal Lake Hydropower Station will be built soon. After the project is completed, the railway will be built up the mountain. The train traveled along Lake Baikal for eight hours, passing through forty-eight tunnels. The comrades who were stimulated by the beautiful Lake Baikal's creative desire are concentrating on writing, some groups are holding working discussions, and the youth representatives from Brazil, Cuba, and Spain from the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation are talking with Comrade Feng Wenbin. The youth from the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland are visiting our hero models Zhang Ming, Zhao Xingyuan, Guo Junqing, Tian Guiying, and Liang Jun. The train is filled with a tense and pleasant atmosphere.

    In Irkutsk, we received another warm welcome. Some elderly people also traveled a long distance to the station. They squeezed through the crowd, hugged us with tears, and said to us, "Children, I am happy for you. You have won, and you are also living a free and happy life." Before we departed, the platform was crowded with people who wanted to see the Chinese youth one more time. Comrade Feng Wenbin, standing at the door of the train, gave several "Long Live the Friendship Between the Youth of China and the Soviet Union" commemorative badges from his bag to several young people next to him. The people on the platform immediately surged over like a wave. The train had already started moving at this time, and a young man jumped on the train, regardless of the administrator shouting loudly at him. He took the commemorative badge of Chairman Mao, shook hands with everyone to thank them, and then jumped off the train.

    At Irkutsk station, we received many more gifts. There was perfume, soap, chocolate candy, and many large apples transported from the Uzbek Republic.

    October 27th

    Yesterday, a grand welcome meeting was held in Krasnoyarsk. Today we passed through Novosibirsk, a large city in Siberia. The Novosibirsk station is magnificent and beautiful, with luxurious lounges, reading rooms, and medical rooms. There is also a cinema in the station that shows movies specifically for passengers waiting for trains. The film being shown this day was the Chinese film "Daughters of China."

    The welcome meeting was held in the square of the station. Our delegation was addressed by Comrade Zhang Ben. Her speech received continuous applause. After the meeting, the masses rushed to the stage to embrace the representatives. A girl hugged and kissed Zhang Ben again and again. This revolutionary friendship has no language or ethnic barriers and distance.

    In the afternoon, we passed Omsk, another large city in Siberia, on the Ob River. After the October Revolution, the White bandit Kolchak, who colluded with the imperialists to attack the Soviet Union, was executed by the Soviet people in Omsk. At the welcoming rally for the Chinese youth delegation, the youth of Omsk released countless pigeons. Free pigeons fly in the sky, and free youth cheer on the ground. Siberia is so full of life. As the train travels through its majestic plains, forests, rivers, and cities, we have developed a deep affection for it.

    October 28th

    This morning, a welcome meeting was held in Tyumen. In the evening, we arrived in Sverdlovsk. We have moved from Siberia to the Ural region. The Urals are the boundary between Europe and Asia, rich in minerals, and the treasure house of the Soviet state. Sverdlovsk is the industrial center of this region. The Ural River is also the place where the famous hero Chapayev dedicated himself to the motherland. The city of Sverdlovsk has a population of one million. The city's architecture is magnificent, and the train arrived at the station when it was already brightly lit. Students from the Suvorov Military Academy stood on both sides of the station to welcome us. We walked out of the station in the sound of music. As we walked onto a tall stone bridge, we heard a burst of warm cheers. Thousands of people stood densely packed in the square below the bridge. Images of Stalin and Chairman Mao were hung on both sides of the bridge. Cheers followed cheers at the venue. The square gradually quieted down when the band played the national anthem. The weather in the Urals was already very cold, but the flowers handed to us were fragrant. One of our comrades asked, "Are there still flowers in such cold weather?" The secretary of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Party Committee smiled and said, "The youth delegation of Mao Zedong has arrived, and they should be presented with flowers." The comrades in Sverdlovsk repeatedly urged us to stay longer in Sverdlovsk when we return to China, because Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai stayed here for four hours during their visit to the Soviet Union.

    October 29th

    The last stop to Moscow is Kirov, the birthplace of Kirov. Before the revolution, it was a small town, now it is an industrial center. Kirov grew up in an orphanage. Now this orphanage is a well-equipped school. The seat that Kirov sat in as a child has become a competition trophy for the children in the school. Whoever studies well can sit in Kirov's seat. In Kirov's hometown, we received another warm welcome.

    We will arrive in Moscow early tomorrow morning, and the comrades are very excited. At dinner, everyone was well-dressed and clean. This was the last dinner on the train, and we all thanked the train staff. Russian dance music sounded on the radio, and the people on the train started dancing. In the lively and joyful rhythm, we happily celebrated tomorrow, because Moscow is welcoming us. [Xinhua News Agency]

    在赴莫斯科的旅途上
    孙维世
    由于苏联列宁共产主义青年团的邀请，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志率领中国青年代表团于十月二十日由北京启程赴莫斯科访问。与代表团同行的有在中国参观了四十天的世界民主青联代表团。现在将沿途日记的片段，寄给国内关心代表团的读者们。
    十月二十三日
    出了满洲里，火车在铺了白雪的平原上奔驰，不久就看见了一个高大的石碑，这就是国界。再见了，亲爱的祖国，我们怀着对你无限的热爱暂时和你告别。
    我们此行是为了巩固与发展中苏两国青年的友谊，学习苏联青年建设祖国与列宁共产主义青年团的工作经验。我虽不是第一次去莫斯科，却和第一次去莫斯科的同志一样的兴奋。
    火车很快地到了奥特波——苏联边境上的第一个小站，在这里我们换乘了苏联的火车。我们被安置在洁净美丽的卧车上，每间屋子里都有雪白的床单，蓝色的窗帏，红色的桌灯和明亮的镜子。安顿好了之后，首先我们被招待到餐车里去吃饭。餐车里招待我们的姑娘们系着白色的围裙，头上系着白色的花结向我们微笑。在这里谁也不感到语言的隔阂，大家亲切地笑着说着，做着手势，好像我们都是早已认识了的。晚餐很丰富，有各种各样的酒菜和鲜果，世界青联代表、苏联共产主义青年团书记之一赛米恰斯尼昨天还在中国作客，现在就是我们殷勤的主人了。我们不断地为斯大林和毛主席的健康、为中苏两国青年的友谊干杯。餐车主任是一个四十岁左右的人，他告诉我们说：毛主席到莫斯科去的时候，他曾被派去作招待工作，当他说到他曾看见毛主席时，又是幸福，又是骄傲。
    夜里，我们睡在温暖舒适的床上，有些疲倦了，但却兴奋得不能入睡。明天我们就要到赤塔了，赤塔在十九世纪普式庚时代，是个一百间木屋的村落，是十二月革命党人被流放的所在。十二月革命党人的妻子跟着他们受难的丈夫，历尽了千辛万苦，从遥远的彼得格勒走到赤塔，她们住过的地方后来就被称为“妇人街”。那时妇女从彼得堡到赤塔来是件破天荒的事情。现在赤塔是西伯利亚东部的大城市，又是交通要道。苏联妇女早就成为这儿的主人了。
    十月二十四日
    远远的就听到音乐的声音，火车开进赤塔车站时，只见人山人海，男女青年捧着鲜花直向将要停下的列车拥了过来。警察们手拉着手围成一条线，挡住拥向火车的欢迎者，给代表们让出一条路。赤塔州团委书记、市团委书记和青年团的负责同志都到车站来欢迎。我们一下车，欢迎者就高声向我们欢呼，无数的手伸了过来抢着和我们握手，有的警察也兴奋得忘了维持秩序和我们握起手来，有些人就趁空拥了进来抱着我们的代表们亲吻。就在列车旁边开始了赤塔青年欢迎中国青年访苏代表团与世界青联代表团的欢迎大会。大会结束后我们向赤塔的青年告别，他们再一次热烈地和我们握手拥抱，并且赠送我们各种各样的礼物，有的送书，有的送本子，有的送纪念章，我们的女战斗英雄郭俊卿就在这次欢迎会上得到了四十多枚各种不同的纪念章，有一个姑娘赠送了自己的照片。有的人没带礼物，就把自己的眼镜盒作了礼品。少年先锋队的队员们把他们自己带的红领巾取了下来，给我们带在颈上。他们说：“毛泽东从我们这里走过，我们送给了他我们的红领巾。姐姐们和叔叔们，请你们告诉亲爱的毛泽东，说赤塔的少先队员们问候他。”在音乐声中，我们上了火车，每人领上都带了红领巾，劳动模范田桂英就带上了七八个。赤塔的青年们和孩子们举起千百只热情的手与我们告别，这种真诚的友谊使我们深深感动。苏联的人民热爱自己的祖国，他们也热爱与他们并肩保卫和平的中国人民，这种爱国主义与国际主义的教育，是从儿童时代就培养起的。火车开动了，冯文彬同志站在车门向他们高呼：“中苏两国人民与青年友谊万岁！”下面随着响起了春雷般的呼声，已经望不见赤塔车站了，但还可隐约听到这热情的呼声。
    十月二十五日
    火车现在在贝加尔湖畔奔驰。贝加尔湖是世界第一大淡水湖，太阳照耀着荡漾的湖水，一眼望去好像无边无际的海洋一样。车上的无线电也正在放送“贝加尔湖之歌”。赛米恰斯尼告诉我们说不久就要修筑贝加尔湖水电站，这工程完成后，铁路就要修到山上去。火车沿贝加尔湖走了八小时，穿过了四十八个山洞。被美丽的贝加尔湖刺激了创作欲的同志在聚精会神地写作，有的小组开起工作讨论会来，世界青联代表团的巴西、古巴和西班牙的青年在和冯文彬同志交谈，苏联、匈牙利、波兰的青年访问我们的英雄模范张明、赵兴元、郭俊卿、田桂英和梁军。列车上充满了紧张愉快的空气。
    在伊尔库茨克我们又受到一次热烈的欢迎。有些老年人也老远地赶到车站，他们从人群里挤进来，带着泪水和我们拥抱，和我们说“孩子们，我为你们高兴，你们胜利了，你们也过着自由幸福的生活了。”我们启行之前，月台上挤得水泄不通，大家都想再多看一看中国的青年。站在车门上的冯文彬同志把他袋子里的几个“中苏两国青年友谊万岁”纪念章送给他身边的几个青年，月台上的人马上就像浪头似地涌了过来。列车这时已经开动了，有一个青年跳上了火车，不管管理员向他大声喊叫。他拿了毛主席的纪念章，和大家握手致谢后才跳下车去。
    在伊尔库茨克车站我们又得到了许多礼物。有香水、香皂、巧格力糖，还有很多从乌兹贝克共和国运来的大苹果。
    十月二十七日
    昨天在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克举行了盛大的欢迎会。今天经过了西伯利亚的大城市新西伯利亚。新西伯利亚的车站辉煌美丽，有华丽的休息室，和阅览室、医疗室等。车站内还有电影场，专门放映电影给候车的旅客们看，这一天放映的恰是中国影片《中华女儿》。
    欢迎大会就在车站的广场上举行。我们代表团由张本同志讲话，她的演讲获得了不断的掌声，会后群众一涌上台，和代表们拥抱。一个女孩子抱着张本吻了又吻，这种革命的友谊是没有任何语言和民族的隔阂与距离的。
    下午过西伯利亚的另一大城，鄂毕河畔的鄂木斯克。十月革命后勾结帝国主义进攻苏联的白匪高尔察克，即被苏联人民处决于鄂木斯克。鄂木斯克的青年们在欢迎中国青年代表团的大会上放出了无数的鸽子。自由的鸽子在天空飞翔，自由的青年们在地上欢呼。西伯利亚是这样地充沛着生命，当火车穿过它雄伟的平原、树林、河流、城市时，我们已对它产生了深厚的感情。
    十月二十八日
    今天上午在汀门开了欢迎会，晚上抵斯维德罗夫斯克城，我们已从西伯利亚走到乌拉尔区了，乌拉尔是欧洲与亚洲的分界，矿产丰富，是苏维埃国家的宝库。斯维德罗夫斯克就是此区的工业中心。乌拉尔河又是著名的英雄夏伯阳献身祖国的地方。斯城有一百万人口，城市建筑宏美，火车到达车站时已经是灯火辉煌的时候了。车站两旁肃立着欢迎我们的苏沃罗夫军官学校的学生。我们在音乐声中走出车站，当走上一座高大的石桥时，就听见一片热烈的欢呼，桥下广场上已经黑压压地站立着数千人，桥两旁挂着斯大林与毛主席的像。会场上一阵欢呼接着一阵欢呼，当乐队奏起国歌时广场上才渐渐安静下来。乌拉尔的天气已经很寒冷了，可是送到我们手上来的却是香气扑鼻的鲜花。我们中的一位同志问道：“这样寒冷的天气还有鲜花？”斯维德罗夫斯克州党委书记笑着说：“毛泽东的青年代表团来了，应该给他们献鲜花”。斯城的同志们再三嘱咐，要我们在回国时一定在斯城多留些时候，理由是毛泽东主席和周恩来总理访苏时曾在这里停留过四个钟头。
    十月二十九日
    到莫斯科最后的一站是基洛夫城，这是基洛夫诞生的地方，革命前是个小镇，现在是个工业中心。基洛夫是在孤儿院长大起来的。现在这座孤儿院已是一所设备完善的学校。基洛夫小时坐过的位子成了学校内孩子们竞赛的锦标。谁学习得好就可以坐到基洛夫的位子上去。在基洛夫的故乡，我们又受到一次热烈的欢迎。
    明天一早就要到莫斯科了，同志们都很兴奋。晚餐的时候，大家都换洗得很整洁，这是在列车上最后的晚餐了，我们大家向列车工作人员致谢。无线电响起俄罗斯舞曲，车上的人都跳起舞来。在活泼喜悦的节拍里，我们欢欣地庆祝着明天，因为莫斯科在欢迎我们。【新华社讯】
