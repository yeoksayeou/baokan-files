Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of the People's Republic of China, and his advisor Qiao Guanhua, along with their assistants, who attended the United Nations Security Council to discuss the People's Republic of China Central People's Government's accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan, returned to Beijing at 4:00 PM today. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included: Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Wentian, Shao Lizi, Ma Xulun, Liang Xi, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Xiruo, Liao Chengzhi, Zhu Xuefan, Qi Yanming, Zhang Hanfu, Xu Guangping, Rong Gaotang, Nie Weiqing, Xue Zizheng, Wang Bingnan, and representatives from various organizations and groups, totaling approximately 200 people. When Representative Wu Xiuquan, Advisor Qiao Guanhua, and their assistants disembarked, the welcomers rushed forward to offer them flowers and shake hands. Guo Moruo delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression. After extending a warm welcome and regards on behalf of all the Chinese people to Representative Wu Xiuquan, Advisor Qiao Guanhua, and others, Guo Moruo said: "Our special representatives, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet representatives at Success Lake, utterly defeated the diplomatic front of the United States and its vassal states. The firm will of the Chinese people to oppose American aggression and defend world peace, responsibly conveyed by Representative Wu Xiuquan, has resounded throughout the world. Although the Security Council, under the coercion of American imperialism, has rejected our just demands, the people of the world can see clearly: the United States is an aggressor and should be punished, and is indeed being punished. The righteous actions of the Chinese people are receiving the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the people of the world." Guo Moruo emphasized: "The Korean people are bound to achieve a complete victory. The people of Taiwan are bound to achieve complete liberation. The increasingly powerful peace camp is bound to overwhelm the aggression camp. The grave that the American imperialists are digging for themselves is about to be completed."

After Guo Moruo delivered his welcome speech, Representative Wu Xiuquan delivered a reply amidst the enthusiastic shouts of "Long live the great victory of the Chinese people!" "Long live the victory of lasting world peace!" Representative Wu Xiuquan said: "We went to the United Nations Security Council with the will and hope of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the people of the whole country, to accuse the United States of its aggression against our territory of Taiwan and the atrocities of bombing our northeastern border. We put forward the legitimate demands of the Chinese people in the Security Council. Although, due to American manipulation, our Chinese people's legitimate demands were rejected, our Chinese people's just demands were supported and sponsored by the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in the United Nations; they were also supported and sponsored by the people of the world; and they were also supported and sponsored by the peace-loving people of the United States. Peace-loving people all over the world believe that our accusation not only represents the voice of the Chinese people but also represents the voice of the oppressed people all over the world." After recounting the warm welcome the delegation received from the American people in the United States, Representative Wu Xiuquan said: "The day after we arrived in New York, we happened to encounter a major storm. We saw the gloomy atmosphere in New York at that time, which symbolized the impending death of imperialism. However, when we took off to return home today, the weather was very good, and we saw the radiant sun rising from Siberia and our motherland, which symbolizes the new birth of the people's democratic world, and that all roads in the world are leading to the victory of the people."

    伍修权代表等一行返抵北京
    郭沫若致欢迎词，伍修权致答词，一致指出和平民主阵营一定能够压倒侵略阵营。
    【新华社三十日讯】我国出席联合国安全理事会讨论中华人民共和国中央人民政府所提出的控诉武装侵略台湾案的中华人民共和国特派代表伍修权和顾问乔冠华及其助理人员等已于今日下午四时返抵北京。前往机场欢迎者有：郭沫若、陈叔通、沈钧儒、黄炎培、张闻天、邵力子、马叙伦、梁希、章伯钧、罗隆基、张奚若、廖承志、朱学范、齐燕铭、章汉夫、许广平、荣高棠、聂维庆、薛子正、王炳南，及各机关团体代表共约二百余人。当伍修权代表和顾问乔冠华及其助理人员等下机时，欢迎者纷纷趋前，向他们献花和握手。郭沫若代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会致欢迎词。郭沫若在向伍修权代表、乔冠华顾问等表示了全中国人民所共同怀抱着的热烈的欢迎和慰问之后说：“我们的特派代表在成功湖和苏联代表并肩作战，把美国和它的仆从国的外交阵线打得落花流水了。我们中国人民反对美国侵略和保卫世界和平的坚强意志，感谢伍修权代表负责的传达，已经响遍全世界。尽管安全理事会在美帝国主义挟持之下，拒绝了我们的正义主张，但是全世界人民都是看得清清楚楚的：美国是侵略国，应该受惩罚，同时也正在受着惩罚。我们中国人民的正义行动是得到全世界人民一致的热烈支持的。”郭沫若强调指出：“朝鲜人民是一定要得到全面胜利的。台湾同胞是一定要得到彻底解放的。日益壮大的和平阵营是一定要压倒侵略阵营的。美帝国主义者为它自己所掘的坟墓已经快要挖成功了。”
    郭沫若致欢迎词毕，伍修权代表在欢迎者热烈高呼“中国人民伟大的胜利万岁！”“全世界持久和平胜利万岁！”等口号声中致答词。伍修权代表说：“我们带着中华人民共和国中央人民政府和全国人民的意志和希望到联合国安全理事会，控诉了美国侵略我国领土台湾，和轰炸我国东北边境的暴行。我们在安全理事会提出了中国人民合理的要求。虽然由于美国的操纵，我们中国人民的合理要求被否决了，但是，我们中国人民正义的要求在联合国得到了苏联和各人民民主国家的拥护和赞助；同时也得到全世界人民的拥护和赞助；也得到美国爱好和平人民的拥护和赞助。全世界爱好和平的人民都认为我们的控诉不仅是代表中国人民的呼声，而且也是代表全世界被压迫人民的呼声。”伍修权代表在讲述了代表团在美国所受到的美国人民热烈欢迎的情形之后说：“我们到纽约的第二天，恰巧碰到了一场大风暴。我们看见当时纽约一切都昏暗的气氛，它正象征着帝国主义的死亡就要到来。然而，当着我们今天起飞回国的时候，正是十分好的天气，我们看见光芒万丈的太阳正从西伯利亚和我们祖国的大地上升起，它正象征人民民主的世界正在新生，世界上的条条道路都走向人民的胜利。”（附图片）
