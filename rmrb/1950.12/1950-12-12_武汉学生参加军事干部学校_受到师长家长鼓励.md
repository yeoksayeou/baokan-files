    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 11th: The glorious action of young students in Wuhan participating in various military cadre schools has been encouraged by their parents.

    At the "December 9th" commemoration meeting at Wuhan University, Cha Qian, the vice chairman of the university's school affairs committee, and his wife, Yu Chichang, the dean of the Faculty of Engineering, and his wife, Fang Zhuangyou, a professor in the Department of History, and his wife, spoke one after another, encouraging their sons to join the military cadre schools. Professor Cha Qian's wife said at the meeting, "I was originally a person who opposed war, because every war kills many promising young people; however, today I am encouraging my son, Cha Qikai, to join a military cadre school. Why? Because I realize that in order to eliminate war, we must let our children take up arms and defend the motherland. In order to protect millions of mothers, we must let our children participate in national defense construction!" The second son of Yu Chichang, the dean of the Faculty of Engineering, and his wife, has already registered at Peking University to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Their third son, Yu Bin, at Wuhan University, also asked to join the military cadre school, and they both fully agreed. Yu Chichang's wife said at the meeting, "Which mother doesn't love her children; but I feel that my children are not my private property, but the property of the country and the people. My children's participation in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and military cadre schools is fulfilling their obligations to the people, and it is my glory." The second son of Fang Zhuangyou, a professor in the Department of History, and his wife, registered in the north to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and his third son, Fang Keqiang, decided to join the military cadre school. Their mother, Zhang Jingfen, said, "I love my children very much, and I am willing to sacrifice everything for my children. My second son is studying at Peking University, and he wrote to me last week to tell me that he has registered to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Because the news was so sudden, I was very sad. Later, I thought, what is the purpose of raising children? Is it for myself? I finally figured it out and approved of his actions. Now my third son, Fang Keqiang, has also decided to join the military cadre school. I was very angry at first. Later, after thinking about it, I thought that my children are all very good children, they study very hard, and their grades are also very good. Why don't I contribute them to the country? Therefore, I changed my mind and encouraged him to join the military cadre school."

    Ruan Yingshan, a 64-year-old people's representative of the Wuhan City Wuchang District People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, not only encouraged his fourth son to register, but also mobilized a young worker, Yin Qingshan, to apply for a military cadre school. Yang Songchao, a representative of ethnic minorities in the district, also encouraged his grand-nephew to register. Wan Xiangyun, a representative of housewives in Wuchang District, spoke at the district's enrollment committee, mobilizing mothers to hand over their children to the motherland to defend their country.

    As of the 10th of this month in Wuhan, according to incomplete statistics, more than 1,200 people have registered to participate in military cadre schools.

    武汉学生参加军事干部学校
    受到师长家长鼓励
    【新华社汉口十一日电】武汉市青年学生参加各种军事干部学校的光荣行动，受到了父母的鼓励。
    武汉大学在“一二、九”纪念会上，该校校务委员会副主任查谦夫妇、工学院院长余炽昌夫妇、历史系教授方壮犹夫妇等，纷纷发言，鼓励他们的儿子参加军事干部学校。查谦教授的夫人在大会上说：“我本是一个反对战争的人，因为每次战争都要打死许多年青有为的孩子；但是，今天我却鼓励我的儿子查其恺参加军事干部学校了。为什么呢？因为我认识到，为了消灭战争，必须让我们的孩子去拿起武器，捍卫祖国。为了保卫千百万个母亲，必须让我们的孩子去参加国防建设！”该校工学院院长余炽昌夫妇的二儿子已经在北京大学报名参加中国人民志愿部队。他在武汉大学的三儿子余彬又要求参加军事干部学校，他们夫妇都完全同意。余炽昌夫人在大会上说：“那个母亲不爱自己的孩子；可是我觉得，我的孩子不是自己私有的，而是国家的、人民的财产。我的孩子参加中国人民志愿部队和军事干部学校，这是替人民尽义务，是我的光荣。”该校历史系教授方壮犹夫妇的二儿子在北方报名参加中国人民志愿部队，他的三儿子方克强决定参加军事干部学校。他们的母亲张镜芬说：“我非常爱孩子，我愿意为我的孩子牺牲一切。我二儿子上北大，上星期来信告诉我他已经报名参加中国人民志愿军了。因为这个消息太突然，我非常难过。后来我想抚育孩子到底是为什么呢？难道是为我自己吗？我终于想通了，赞成他的行动。现在我的三儿子方克强又决定参加军事干部学校了。我最初非常生气。后来经过考虑，我想起我的孩子们都是很好的孩子，读书都很用功，成绩也很好。我为什么不把他们贡献给国家呢？因此，我才转变过来，鼓励他参加军事干部学校。”
    武汉市武昌区人民代表会议协商委员会人民代表六十四岁的阮英善不仅鼓励他的第四个儿子报名，还动员了青年工人殷清善去投考军事干部学校。该区少数民族代表杨松潮也鼓励自己的侄孙去报名。武昌区家庭妇女代表万湘云在该区招生委员会上发言，动员做母亲的把孩子交给祖国，去保卫自己的国家。
    武汉市截至十日为止，据不完全统计，报名参加军事干部学校的人数已有一千二百余人。
