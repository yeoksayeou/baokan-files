    Lu Xun Works Compilation and Publication Society
    Soliciting Lu Xun's Letters

    The Publication Administration's Lu Xun Works Compilation and Publication Society is preparing to compile and edit the complete works of Mr. Lu Xun. Regarding the letters section, Ms. Xu Guangping once solicited them in 1936, and the received letters were compiled into "Lu Xun's Letters." Mr. Lu Xun corresponded with a wide range of people during his lifetime, and it is believed that many letters are still preserved by friends, so there is a need to continue collecting and publishing them. Therefore, the Society solemnly requests friends who have Mr. Lu Xun's letters to help complete this task. In addition, if you have any other manuscripts and works by Mr. Lu Xun, please also inform the Society so that we can discuss borrowing them. The methods are as follows:

    1. Those who have Lu Xun's letters are requested to send the original copies by registered mail to No. 12, Lane 309, Wujin Road, Shanghai. After photographing them for preservation, they will be immediately returned by registered mail.

    2. Those who have other manuscripts or calligraphy by Mr. Lu Xun are also requested to send them to the Society by registered mail. After photographing them, they will be returned immediately. However, if they are already framed, or too large to be mailed, please take a four-inch photo and send the negative to the Society. The photography costs will be reimbursed by the Society.

    3. If you have old newspapers and magazines before the "May Fourth" Movement, such as "Henan," "Yueduo Daily," and "Fiction Forest," which contain Mr. Lu Xun's early writings, please also inform us by letter so that we can discuss borrowing them.

    鲁迅著作编刊社
    征求鲁迅书简作品
    出版总署鲁迅著作编刊社准备编校鲁迅先生的全部著作。关于书简部分，一九三六年许广平先生曾经征求过一次，已经把收到的编成“鲁迅书简”，鲁迅先生生前和人通信，范围很广，想书简保存在朋友手边的一定还有不少，现在还有继续搜集编印的必要。因此，该杜郑重请求藏有鲁迅先生书简的朋友，帮助完成这件工作。此外如有保存鲁迅先生其他各种手迹和作品的，亦盼告知该社，以便商洽借用。办法如下： 
    一、藏有鲁迅书简的，请将原件用双挂号信寄到上海武进路三○九弄十二号，待摄影留底后，当立刻用双挂号信寄还。
    二、藏有鲁迅先生其他手稿或墨迹的，也请用双挂号信寄该社，摄影后当立刻寄还。但已经装裱、体积过大，不便邮寄的，请拍成四寸照片连同底片寄该社。摄影费用当由该社归还。
    三、收藏有“五四”以前的旧报纸杂志如《河南》、《越铎日报》、《小说林》等，里面载有鲁迅先生早年文字的，亦请函告以便商洽借用。
