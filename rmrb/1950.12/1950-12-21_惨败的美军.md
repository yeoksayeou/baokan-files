    The American Army's Miserable Defeat
    By our staff reporter Tan Wenrui

    As the American invading forces are collapsing in disarray, more and more "American soldiers" are appearing in our army's rear. These people, recognizing the irresistible power of the Chinese People's Volunteers, laid down their weapons in time and preserved their lives. The reporter saw several hundred American prisoners of war who had just been escorted from the front lines in a certain area north of Changjin Lake. They were officers and soldiers of the U.S. 7th Infantry Division captured by our People's Volunteers in the encirclement and annihilation battles in the Changjin and Hamhung areas. They are being well-treated by our volunteers. The wounded have received preliminary treatment. They are not only able to get enough to eat and wear, but are also carefully cared for to avoid being killed by their own heinous planes. Although many are frustrated by the shattering of their dreams of "going home for Christmas," and some even cry like children because they miss their families, they are all grateful that they are still alive and can look forward to spending next Christmas with their families. They have personally witnessed how many of their comrades lost their lives on the battlefield, while others, wearing only thin clothes, are waiting for death in the wind and snow.

    This U.S. 7th Infantry Division has been almost completely annihilated. The division commander, Barr, who once served as a "military advisor" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, did not expect to be severely punished by the Chinese people on the Korean battlefield. According to American prisoners, he had a helicopter that was often parked only a few hundred yards from his headquarters, ready to escape at any time.

    Barr's division was truly a pampered force, originally stationed in Hokkaido, Japan. Most of the soldiers were new recruits around the age of twenty, many of whom were children who had not yet reached voting age. After several months of training after enlisting, they were sent to Japan to enjoy the "occupation benefits." They never thought they would be sent to fight. In September, they were incorporated into the draftees seized by the Syngman Rhee puppet government in South Korea, increasing their numbers to more than 22,000. In late September, they left Japan and participated in the landing operation personally commanded by MacArthur, but in reality, they did not undertake any combat missions. Only a portion of them fought for just five hours near Suwon, losing more than a hundred men. Afterwards, they went to Busan, and in late October, they landed at Liwon on the east coast by landing craft, preparing to cooperate with the "offensive to end the war" on the eastern front. After arriving in Hamhung, they pointed their troops north and headed straight for Changjin Lake without any obstruction. As they marched, they talked about what loot to take back to their loved ones as Christmas presents. These arrogant, inexperienced individuals encountered the resistance of our People's Volunteers near Old Jinli. They were hit hard and immediately scurried back like rabbits, but they found that they had been tightly surrounded by our People's Volunteers. In less than a few days, the 31st and 32nd Regiments were completely annihilated, and these few hundred prisoners were the only survivors.

    These American officers and soldiers originally thought that with their superior (which was not necessarily superior) equipment, they would be invincible. After suffering a heavy blow, they suddenly awoke from their dream. Captain Speer of the 57th Artillery Battalion, a veteran who participated in World War II, frankly said, recalling their disastrous encounter: "In all honesty, the firepower of our planes and artillery is quite strong. After several tens of minutes of suppressive bombing and shelling, we thought the enemy's positions must have been destroyed, and aerial reconnaissance also confirmed this to us. But when our infantry advanced to seize the enemy's positions, they were beaten bloody by your army's machine guns and grenades. We really don't understand why. Do you have some new weapons that can withstand bombs and artillery shells?" Lieutenant Coke of the 31st Regiment was still somewhat unconvinced: "Your mountain warfare is indeed excellent, but if we fight on the plains, I'm afraid we would be a bit better, because our tanks can't exert their power in the mountains." Speer reminded his partner: "Don't forget that they also have tanks, and their grenades are a powerful anti-tank weapon."

    The enemy was extremely surprised by the speed of our volunteers' movements, and even couldn't figure out why they couldn't outrun our soldiers' two legs even when driving cars. They were most afraid of our volunteers' flanking and rear attacks. Our volunteers' night raids were also the most frightening to the enemy. Private First Class Fred Lane of the 31st Regiment said: "In the pitch-black night, planes and artillery lost their effect, and we couldn't even tell where the enemy was when we heard gunfire." Many prisoners, when asked where they were captured, answered: "In the sleeping bag." Private First Class Boid brazenly said: "In Japan, we looked forward to the night every day, so we could go find women and places to drink; but here, as soon as the sun goes down, we are terrified." They all admitted that they had no way to deal with our volunteers' night raids, which they considered "uncivilized."

    The prisoners talked about the high morale and brave fighting of our soldiers with lingering fear. Several people similarly said: "Your soldiers fight as bravely as lions." Many of them also wondered why our soldiers were "so unafraid of death." Scott, a tanker in the tank company of the 31st Regiment, recounted his capture: "Our three medium tanks advanced side by side, tasked with covering the infantry's charge. Our cannons and machine guns fired non-stop at the front, destroying all obstacles on the ground. But as we approached your positions, Chinese soldiers climbed out of the trenches one by one, charged forward in the face of intense fire, and jumped onto the tanks to stuff grenades into the turrets. The other two tanks were destroyed in that way. I tried to close the iron hatch but it was too late. I saw a Chinese soldier standing on our tank about to pull the pin on the grenade in his hand. I quickly raised my hands, and when I looked back, I couldn't see our infantry anymore." Of course, the pampered soldiers who chewed gum while fighting could not imagine the qualities of our soldiers who endured hardship and were hard-working.

    The invading soldiers who had been taught a lesson understood that the most important reason why they were so vulnerable was their low morale. Captain Arrey of the artillery regiment, although he had not heard Stalin's famous saying that "an army that knows why it fights is invincible," he already understood: "Your soldiers are fighting for a just cause, so they are fearless troops. We are fighting only because we are ordered to fight, and we fire our guns only because we want to save our own lives. When we knew that we were facing the brave and skilled Chinese volunteers, we were all worried about our fate. After our soldiers were surrounded, they immediately fell into panic, depression, and chaos. Nothing could revive our morale. Their only hope was to escape. If they couldn't escape, they had no choice but to surrender. An army like ours will never win."

    The enemy who suffered a heavy blow has already learned the lesson they deserved. The enemy who does not accept the lesson will continue to be attacked until they surrender or are annihilated.

    惨败的美军
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    当美国侵略军正在狼狈溃败的时候，我军后方的“美国兵”是愈来愈多了。这些人因为认识了中国人民志愿军不可抗的力量，及时放下武器而保全了自己的生命。记者在长津湖以北某地看到了刚从前线押解下来好几百美国战俘，他们是在长津、咸兴地区围歼战中被我人民志愿军俘虏的美国步兵第七师的官兵。他们受着我志愿军很好的优待，受伤的都已获得了初步的治疗，他们不但可以得到温饱，而且被小心照顾着，避免给他们自己的万恶的飞机炸死。虽然有许多人因为“回家度圣诞节”的梦的破灭而懊丧，而且有些因为想念家庭竟像小孩子般地哭泣；但是他们却无不为自己还能活着，还能盼望和他们的家人度过明年的圣诞节而庆幸，他们曾亲眼看见多少他们的同伙在战场上丢掉了性命，而另外的一些则还穿着单薄的衣服在风雪中等待着死亡。
    这个美国第七步兵师已经几乎被全部歼灭了，曾经给蒋匪介石当过“军师”的师长巴大维没有想到会在朝鲜的战场上受到了中国人民的严惩。据美国俘虏说，他有一架直升飞机经常停放在离他指挥部仅数百码的地方，随时准备逃跑。
    巴大维手下的这个师是真正的少爷兵，原驻在日本的北海道，士兵们绝大部分都是二十岁上下的新兵，有许多是还没有达到投票年龄的小孩子。他们入伍后经过几个月的训练便被派过日本去享“占领福”去了，从来就没有想到他们会被派去打仗的。九月中编入李承晚傀儡政府在南朝鲜抓去的壮丁，把人数扩增到两万二千多人。九月下旬便离开了日本，参加了麦克阿瑟亲自指挥的登陆战，但实际上并没有担任过战斗任务，只有一部分在水原附近打过仅仅五个钟头的仗，损失了一百多人。以后就开到釜山，十月下旬乘登陆艇在东海岸的利源登陆，准备在东线配合“结束战争的攻势”。他们到了咸兴以后，就指兵北向，无阻无拦，顺利地直奔长津湖。他们一边走一边谈论着带些什么掠夺品回去给爱人作圣诞礼物。这些没有见过世面的狂妄者到了旧津里附近，就遇到了我人民志愿军的阻击了，挨了当头一棒，便立刻象兔子一般回头窜逃，但是已经发现被我人民志愿军所严密地包围，不到几天，第三十一及三十二两个团已完全被歼灭，这几百俘虏是仅有的残存者。
    这些美国官兵本来以为凭着优越（其实也不见得优越）的装备，就能够所向无敌，遭受了沉重的打击后才恍如大梦初醒。炮兵团五十七营的上尉史皮尔（Speer），一个曾参加第二次世界大战的老兵，回想到他们的惨败遭遇，直率地说：“凭良心说，我们飞机和大炮的火力是相当强的，经过几十分钟压制的轰炸与轰击之后，满以为敌人的阵地一定已经被摧毁了，而且飞机的侦察也向我们证实这一点，但是当我们的步兵向前夺取敌阵的时候，却被你们军队的机关枪与手榴弹打得头破血流，我们真不明白是什么道理，你们是不是有什么能抵挡炸弹和炮弹的新武器？”第三十一团的一个中尉柯克（Coke）还有点不服输：“你们的山地战的确是拿手的，但是如果在平地作战，恐怕我们比较有点办法，因为我们的坦克在山地上不能发挥威力。”史皮尔却提醒他的伙伴：“你别忘了他们也有坦克的，而且他们的手榴弹是一种厉害的反坦克武器。”
    敌人对于我志愿军运动的迅速极感惊奇，甚至都想不透为什么开着汽车还跑不过我们战士的两条腿。他们最害怕我们志愿军的迂回和侧背攻击。我们志愿军的夜袭也是最使敌人胆寒的。三十一团的上等兵兰勒（Fred Lane）说：“在黑漆漆的夜里，飞机大炮失去了作用，听见了枪声还不知道敌人在那一方”。有许多俘虏被问到是在那里被俘的时候，他们的回答是：“在睡袋中。”一个上等兵波德（Boid）厚着脸皮道：“在日本的时候，我们每天都在盼着夜的来临，好去找女人和喝酒的地方；而在这里，太阳一下山，我们就心惊胆跳了。”他们都承认没有办法对付我们志愿军这种他们认为“不文明”的夜袭。
    俘虏们谈起我们战士斗志的旺盛与作战的英勇都犹有余悸，好几个人同样都说：“你们的士兵打起仗来勇猛得像狮子。”他们许多人并且怀疑为什么我们的战士会“那样的不怕死”。三十一团坦克连的一个坦克兵史葛（Scott）追述他被俘的经过说：“我们三辆中型坦克并排着向前开，担任掩护步兵冲锋的任务，我们的炮和机枪不停地向着前面射击，摧毁地面一切的障碍物，但是当我们驶近你们的阵地的时候，中国士兵一个个从壕堑中爬出来，冒着猛烈的炮火向前冲，跳上坦克往炮塔里塞手榴弹。另外两辆坦克都那样被炸坏了，我要赶忙把铁盖关起来已经来不及，看见站在我们坦克上的一个中国兵正要拉他手里那枚手榴弹的火线，我就急忙举起双手来，回头一看已看不见我们的步兵。”当然，对于我们战士吃苦耐劳的品质，嚼着橡皮糖打仗的少爷兵更是不能想像了。
    受到教训的侵略军士兵都明白了他们所以不堪一击的最重要原因是士气低落。炮兵团的上尉阿雷（Arrey）虽然没有听见过斯大林所说的“知道为什么而战的军队是不可战胜的”名言，但是他也已经明白：“你们的士兵都是为正义的目的而作战的，所以是无畏的军队。而我们作战只是因为上方命令我们作战，我们放枪只是因为想保全自己的生命。当我们知道我们遇到骁勇善战的中国志愿军的时候，便都为自己的命运耽忧了。我们的士兵被包围以后，便立刻陷于恐慌、沮丧与混乱，没有东西能重振我们军心，他们唯一的希望就是逃跑，逃不了就只好投降。我们这样的军队是永远不会战胜的。”
    挨了沉重打击的敌人已经得到应有的教训了，还不接受教训的敌人，将继续被打击，一直到他们投降或者被消灭。
