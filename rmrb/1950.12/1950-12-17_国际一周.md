The Great Victory of the Chinese and Korean People

The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are continuing their victorious counter-offensive, expanding their gains. In this counter-offensive, the Chinese and Korean People's armies have annihilated a large number of enemy forces and liberated vast territories. On the western front alone, in the first week of the counter-offensive (November 25th to December 1st), they killed, wounded, or captured 23,000 enemy soldiers. Among them, 8,085 American (including British and Turkish) officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, 2,272 American (including British and Turkish) soldiers were captured, and 143 American soldiers surrendered. Until recently, almost all of northern Korea and part of southern Korea have been liberated. Pyongyang, the "Democratic Capital" of the Korean people and the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, returned to the hands of the Korean people on December 6th, after being occupied for a month and a half.

This great victory of the Chinese and Korean People's armies dealt a devastating blow to the once-ferocious and frantically invading American-Syngman Rhee bandits, fundamentally improving the Korean war situation. Now, from the battlefield to the United States, the American aggressors are filled with panic, pessimism, and chaos. They have had to admit that they have suffered "the greatest defeat in the history of the U.S. Army" and that the biggest problem at present is "to save as many soldiers and equipment as possible." In order to save the fate of the seven American divisions invading Korea, which "account for three-quarters of the entire U.S. Army," from being completely wiped out, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins and MacArthur successively inspected the Korean battlefield. However, they also "cannot create miracles." Even some reactionary elements in the United States have realized the only future for the Korean war: unless the American invading forces withdraw from Korea, they will only be completely annihilated!

The great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting the Korean people to resist the common enemy most eloquently proves a truth: the power of the people is invincible, and American imperialism is indeed a paper tiger. Despite the enormous advantages of the imperialists in terms of naval and air forces in local areas, they can still be completely defeated. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army has fought side by side with the Korean People's Army since October 25th, winning every battle in two counterattacks; while the American invading forces have lost every battle in two defeats, collapsing at the first touch. This clearly shows that the power of the victorious great Chinese people is invincible.

This great victory on the Korean battlefield has severely damaged the ferocious aggressive arrogance of American imperialism, greatly encouraged the just struggle of the Asian people and the people of the world against imperialist enslavement and aggression, and further strengthened their victorious confidence in winning world peace. This undoubtedly makes an extremely important contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

The U.S. Imperialists Have Not Learned Their Lesson

Although the American imperialist bloc has suffered a devastating blow and an irreversible defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, it still has not learned its due lesson. Instead, it is determined to continue this hopeless war of aggression against Korea and intensify preparations for expanding the war of aggression.

The Truman-Attlee talks held in Washington from the 4th to the 8th of this month, although unable to conceal the irreparable failure of the American-British bloc's fundamental policy in Korea and the internal contradictions that have been expanded as a result, at the same time exposed the imperialists' sinister intention not to be reconciled to failure and to resolutely oppose the people of Asia and the people of the world to the end. The communiqué issued after the talks nakedly reiterated the unchanging aggressive stance of the American and British imperialists. The communiqué stated: In Korea, "the forces of our two countries will continue to fulfill their responsibilities." The communiqué threatened that if the people of China and Korea did not submit to imperialist aggression, "then the people of all countries in the world will need to decide through the United Nations how the principles of the Charter can be best maintained... We declare in advance that we have the firm will to defend it." The communiqué unscrupulously expressed that aggressive policies would be implemented "strongly, whether in the Far East or elsewhere." In order to achieve this goal, the United States and Britain decided to "increase" military strength and expand arms production as "quickly as possible," and to force "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to take immediate action to intensify their efforts" in order to make up for the fatal shortage of troops of American imperialism, and to coerce hesitant and apprehensive Western European vassal states to follow the United States' crazy plan of aggression towards a war of destruction.

Shortly after the end of the Truman-Attlee talks, Truman further launched war preparations at home, first attempting to place the country under total wartime control. Truman convened leaders of the Democratic Party in Congress on the 11th to discuss the so-called "issue of declaring a national emergency," and on the 12th, he invited leaders of both parties in Congress to discuss the same issue. Marshall also strongly advocated before the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 9th that the United States must immediately declare a state of "emergency" in order to step up war mobilization and entice young people to serve as cannon fodder.

In Western Europe, the United States is intensifying pressure on its vassal states in order to quickly organize a North Atlantic collective aggression force under the command of an American general. The so-called "North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee" meeting began in London on the 12th. The so-called "North Atlantic Treaty Council" and "Defense Committee" will be held simultaneously in Brussels on the 18th and 19th to approve "the plan to establish the Atlantic Army to be commanded by Eisenhower" (United Press). After the meeting, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will be held to complete the final approval process. With increasing pressure from the United States, the reactionary French government has completely succumbed to the United States on the issue of rebuilding the West German Nazi army. At the so-called "North Atlantic Treaty Foreign Ministers' Assistants Meeting" recently held in London under the chairmanship of U.S. representative Spofford, France has agreed to establish thirty brigades of combat troops and integrate them "equally" with the troops of other countries into the North Atlantic "unified army" and accept American command.

At the same time, on the 6th, American imperialism manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass a ridiculous slanderous motion to include the so-called "intervention of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in Korea" on the agenda and submit it to the Political Committee for discussion, attempting to reverse right and wrong, cover up the well-known fact of American military aggression against Korea, and legitimize its aggression. By using this shameless trick, American imperialism and its accomplices cannot but fully expose their sinister conspiracy to refuse a fair resolution of the Korean issue, expand the war of aggression, and antagonize the Chinese people before the people of China and the world.

All of this proves the determination of American imperialism to adhere to its policy of aggression, regardless of the world's people's demands for peace. However, the experience in Korea proves that relying on aggression will not yield any benefits, and that what awaits them is only a more tragic failure.

The People of the World Unanimously Condemn Truman

After the American invading forces suffered a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, U.S. President Truman issued a violent statement on November 30, threatening to intimidate the people of the world by expanding the war of aggression. However, this intimidation also met with a shameful failure. As soon as Truman's intimidating statement was released, it immediately aroused a storm of opposition and condemnation from the people of the world. Communist parties in the United States and European countries issued a call, asking the people to take action to stop the war. The statement of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States pointed out: "It is time to stop the hands of the American imperialists." British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt wrote to the Labour Party, asking it to declare that Britain would not participate in the aggression against China. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party called on the French people to unite and rise up against the war of aggression. The German Communist Party called on the German people, regardless of party affiliation, to fight for peace. On the day Truman's statement was issued, the people of the world launched a powerful counter-offensive. The people of the United States and Britain sent tens of thousands of protest telegrams to the White House and Attlee, demanding peace. French workers issued a heroic cry of protest. Workers in major industrial centers in Italy held short strikes on December 1. In Rome, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in front of the parliament and foreign affairs departments, and mass rallies in many cities demanded that Italy withdraw from the North Atlantic aggressive group. The people of Sydney, Australia, held an anti-intimidation demonstration in front of the American consulate. The International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 91 million women in 59 countries, sent protest telegrams. The World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an open letter to the youth of the world, calling on them to oppose war instigators. The Chinese people responded to Truman's provocative statement with an even larger patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

The surging tide of protests against a new war around the world proves that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people has greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the people of the world, and also proves that the powerful call issued by the Second World Peace Congress of "Never wait for peace, but strive for peace" has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people.

Truman's statement did not scare the people, but on the contrary, it scared the small partners in the American imperialist aggression group. The countries of the North Atlantic aggression group, fearing the strength of the Chinese people, were shocked and panicked by Truman's statement. Some people in the ruling groups of Britain and France publicly expressed their fear of waging a hopeless war against China. Even within the American ruling group, fierce debates have been triggered. The chaotic situation within the imperialist group clearly shows how great a change the victory of the Chinese and Korean people has brought about in the international situation.

The only consequence of Truman's intimidating statement was to expose the warlike and hideous face of the American imperialists more nakedly before the people of the world, turning Truman into a cursed name that everyone shouts at like "a rat crossing the street." This makes American imperialism even more isolated. Even the reactionary American newspaper, the *U.S. Mail*, had to sadly admit that Truman's statement was a "tragic mistake."

    国际一周
    中朝人民的伟大胜利
    英雄的朝鲜人民军与我国人民志愿军，正在继续胜利反攻，扩大战果。在这一反攻中，中朝人民军队已经歼灭了敌人大量有生力量，光复了广大的国土。仅在西线，在反攻的最初一周（十一月二十五日到十二月一日）中，就已毙伤俘敌军二万三千人。其中毙伤美军（包括英、土军）官兵八○八五人，俘掳美军（包括英、土军）二二七二人，美军投降一四三人。到最近为止，朝鲜北半部几乎全部地区和南半部一部分地区已经解放。朝鲜人民的“民主之京”、朝鲜共和国临时首都平壤，在沦陷一个半月之后，亦于十二月六日重新回到朝鲜人民的手中。
    中朝人民军队的这一伟大胜利，给了原来张牙舞爪、疯狂进犯的美李匪帮以毁灭性的打击，使朝鲜战局根本好转。现在，从战地到美国国内，美国侵略分子中充满着恐慌、悲观和混乱，他们不得不承认已遭受“美国陆军史上最大的失败”，不得不承认目前最大的问题是“要尽可能多地挽救最多的兵员与装备”。为了要挽救“占美国全部陆军四分之三”的侵朝美军七个师全部被歼的命运，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯和麦克阿瑟曾先后视察朝鲜战场。但是，他们也并“不能创造出奇迹”。就连美国一些反动分子也认识到了朝鲜战局的唯一前途：美国侵略军队除非从朝鲜撤退，不然只有被全部歼灭！
    中国人民志愿军援助朝鲜人民抗击共同敌人的伟大胜利，最雄辩地证明了一个真理：人民的力量是无敌的，而美帝国主义的确是一只纸老虎。尽管帝国主义在局部地区具有这样海空军的巨大优势，但是仍然完全可以被打败的。英勇的中国人民志愿部队自十月二十五日与朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来，两次反击，每战皆捷；而美国侵略军则两战两败，一触即溃。这就清楚地表明：胜利了的伟大的中国人民的力量，是不可战胜的。
    朝鲜战场这个伟大的胜利，严重地打击了美帝国主义凶恶的侵略气焰，大大地鼓舞了亚洲人民和全世界人民反抗帝国主义奴役与侵略的正义斗争，更进一步地加强了它们争取世界和平的胜利信心。这对保卫世界和平的事业，无疑具有极其重大的贡献。
    美帝尚未获得应有教训
    美帝国主义集团虽然已在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭到了歼灭性的打击和无可挽回的失败，但是它仍旧没有因此获得应有的教训，却决心继续这一无望的侵朝战争并加紧扩大侵略战争的准备。
    本月四日到八日在华盛顿举行的杜鲁门艾德礼会谈，虽无法掩饰美英集团在朝鲜的根本政策上的无法挽救的失败，和由此而扩大了的内部矛盾，可是同时又暴露了帝国主义还不甘心失败和坚决与亚洲人民及全世界人民敌对到底的罪恶意图。会谈后发表的公报赤裸裸地重申美英帝国主义者毫无改变的侵略立场。公报说：在朝鲜，“我们两国军队仍将继续履行他们的责任”，公报威胁说如果中朝两国人民不向帝国主义的侵略屈服，“那就需要全世界各国人民通过联合国来决定宪章的原则如何得到最妥善的维持……我们预先宣布我们具有维护它的坚定意志”。公报肆无忌惮地表示“不论在远东或其他地方”将“坚强地”执行侵略政策。为了达到这个目的，美英两国决定“尽速增加”军力、扩大军火生产，并迫使“北大西洋公约国必须立即行动，加紧他们的努力”，这样来弥补美帝国主义致命的兵力不足，并胁迫犹豫、惶惑的西欧附属国跟从美国疯狂的侵略计划走向毁灭的战争。
    杜艾会谈结束不久，杜鲁门即在国内进一步展开备战活动，首先企图把全国置于全面的战时管制之下。杜鲁门已于十一日召集国会民主党领袖讨论所谓“宣布全国处于紧急状态问题”，并于十二日邀集国会两党领袖会商同一问题。马歇尔也在九日参院拨款委员会上力主美国必须立即宣布处于“紧急状态”，以便加紧战争动员，诱骗青年充当炮灰。
    在西欧方面，美国对各附庸国家正加紧施用压力，以便迅速组织在美国将军指挥下的北大西洋集体侵略军。所谓“北大西洋公约军事委员会”会议已于十二日在伦敦开始。所谓“北大西洋公约理事会”和“防务委员会”将于十八、十九两日在布鲁塞尔同时举行，以批准“成立将由艾森豪威尔统率的大西洋军队的计划”（合众社）。会后并将举行美英法三国外长会议完成最后批准程序。在美国压力日益加强的情况下，法国反动政府在重建西德纳粹军队问题上已向美国完全屈膝。最近在美国代表斯波福主持下于伦敦举行的所谓“北大西洋公约外长助理会议”上，法国已同意建立三十个旅的作战部队与其他国家军队“平等地”并入北大西洋“统一军队”，接受美国的指挥。
    与此同时，美帝国主义于六日操纵联合国大会通过将所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的荒谬的毁谤议案列入议程，并交付政委会讨论，企图颠倒是非，掩饰尽人皆知的美国对朝鲜进行军事侵略的事实，并使其侵略行动合法化。美帝国主义及其帮凶使用了这一无耻伎俩，就不能不在中国人民和全世界人民面前，充分暴露了拒绝公正解决朝鲜问题决心扩大侵略战争和敌视中国人民的罪恶阴谋。
    所有这一切，证明美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的和平要求而坚持侵略政策的决心。但是，朝鲜的经验证明：依靠侵略是讨不了便宜的，等待着他们的只是更悲惨的失败。
    全世界人民一致声讨杜鲁门
    美国总统杜鲁门在美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上遭受惨败之后，于十一月三十日发表了一项狂暴的声明，威胁着要以扩大侵略战争来恫吓世界人民。但是这种恫吓，结果也同样遭到了可耻的失败。杜鲁门的恫吓性声明一经公布，立刻就激起了全世界人民暴风雨一般的反对与声讨。美国和欧洲各国的共产党一致发出了号召，要求人民进入行动以制止战争。美国共产党全国委员会的声明指出：“要制止美帝国主义者的手，现在是时候了。”英共总书记波立特致函工党，要求宣布英国不参与对中国的侵略。法共中央委员会号召法国人民团结奋起反对侵略战争。德国共产党号召德国人民不分党派一致为和平而斗争。全世界的人民在杜鲁门声明发表的当日，就实行了强大的反攻。美国和英国人民向白宫和艾德礼发出了成千成万封要求和平的抗议电报。法国工人发出了雄壮的抗议呼声。意大利各大工业中心的工人在十二月一日举行了短时间的罢工，在罗马，成千上万的人民到议会和外交部门前示威，许多城市的群众大会要求意大利退出北大西洋侵略集团。澳大利亚悉尼的人民一日在美国总领事馆门前举行反恫吓的示威。国际民主妇联代表五十九个国家的九千一百万妇女发出抗议电报。世界民主青年联盟发表告全世界青年书，号召反对战争挑拨者。中国人民则用更扩大的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动，来回答杜鲁门的挑衅声明。
    全世界反对新战争的抗议怒潮之汹涌澎湃，证明中朝人民的伟大胜利已大大鼓舞了世界人民的斗志，同时也证明第二届世界和大所发出的“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”的有力号召，已经深入人心。
    杜鲁门的声明没有吓住人民，却相反地吓倒了美帝侵略集团中的小伙计们。北大西洋侵略集团的国家，惧怕中国人民力量的强大，对杜鲁门的声明感到震惊和惶恐。英国和法国统治集团的一些人公开发表言论，表现惧怕对中国进行毫无希望的战争。就是在美国统治集团的内部，也已引起了激烈的争辩。帝国主义集团内部这种混乱的情况，明白显示中、朝人民的胜利已使国际形势发生了何等巨大的变化。
    杜鲁门恫吓声明所得到的唯一后果，只是使美帝国主义者的好战的狰狞面目更赤裸裸地暴露在全世界人民面前，使杜鲁门变成了一个“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的可诅咒的名字。这——使美帝国主义更加陷于孤立。就连美国的反动报纸美国邮报，也不得不悲哀地承认杜鲁门声明是“悲剧性的错误”了。
