American Soldiers are Beasts in Human Skin
By our special correspondent, Yang Shuo
　　
　　The day after I arrived in Korea with the railway volunteer corps, I stayed in the small board room of the chief of staff of the Korean Railway Brigade. In the morning, while still sleeping on the scorching hot floor, the host turned on the radio and tuned to Beijing, where a joyful message was broadcast: "The Liberation of Pyongyang!"
　　This good news directly announced the disastrous defeat of the American bandits. Think about these beasts, before launching their offensive, filled Pyongyang to Kumsong with mechanized troops, boasting to high heaven: "We'll push to Manchuria in three days!" What was the result? Along the way we saw discarded helmets, tanks stuck in the mud, American prisoners being escorted from the front lines… and the bloody crimes left everywhere.
　　The mountains and rivers of North Korea were originally beautiful: rice paddies everywhere, and hills covered with larch trees. When the bandits retreated, they poured kerosene on the rice paddies and set them on fire. The trees all over the mountains were scorched by incendiary bombs, patch after patch of blackness. The large and small cities were blown to pieces, desolate and uninhabited. Where were the people? Before the enemy fled, they threatened to use atomic bombs within two days, intimidating and deceiving the Korean people into retreating south with them. But at the banks of the Chongchon River, they were cut off by the Chinese People's Volunteers, saving many people. When we entered the Jeongju area, the people were returning home one after another. In front of the collapsed houses and in the burned fields, we often saw haggard Korean men and women, wearing only white single clothes in the freezing weather, digging through the ashes and rubble with their hands, trying to find something left over from their homes. One evening, with heavy frost on the ground, I saw a Korean girl, about eight or nine years old, curled up on the side of the road in the big north wind at Guo Shan Station, shivering all over. A comrade who could speak Korean asked her where her mother was. The little girl's mouth was already frozen, and her lips trembled for a long time before she said, "Blown up!" When asked about her father, she said he was also dead. The comrade asked, "Where are you going?" The little girl whispered, "I don't know!"
　　This is the good deed that Truman and his ilk have done in "helping to liberate Korea!" There's more than just that, there's plenty more.
　　One gloomy winter day, I was walking through a remote village when I suddenly heard someone calling from behind, "Comrade, come in and warm up, you look frozen!" Turning around, I saw an old Chinese woman leaning on the door frame waving at me. Meeting someone who speaks the same language in a foreign country is particularly heartwarming, so I went in. I saw another middle-aged woman sitting on the heated floor, surrounded by three or four children, so I asked, "Where is the children's father?" The middle-aged woman's eyes were all red, and she said in a hoarse voice, "Killed! Killed! Killed by the American bandits!"
　　It turned out that there were forty or fifty overseas Chinese households in the area, mostly from Shandong, mainly growing vegetable gardens. After the American soldiers arrived, they held guns, smashed windows, kicked down doors, and searched house to house, pointing guns at people's chests, ready to shoot them through. This family was surnamed Mou. The middle-aged woman said her husband was only wearing a tattered single garment and hiding in an air-raid shelter, but the American soldiers dragged him out, tied him up after kicking and beating him, and there had been no news since, he certainly wasn't alive! At the foot of Yasan Mountain lived a carpenter named Wang. When the American soldiers first arrived, they shot from the mountain. His wife was so scared that she ran away, but she was shot dead as soon as she went out the door. Wang the carpenter carried his wife back, holding back his tears to nail a coffin for her, but before he had nailed half of it, American soldiers broke into the door and tied him up. A nursing child was left on the heated floor. A fellow villager risked his life to pick up the child in the dark, but when he reached out to touch it, it was already frozen solid. In front of the Mou's house was the old Fei's house, with a young woman (girl), only fifteen, not yet an adult. The American bandits held a gun to her father, and violated the young woman until she was half-dead. …
　　Finally, Mou's wife sighed faintly: "Originally, we just thought we were overseas Chinese, maybe we wouldn't be afraid, who knew that the American bandits were so black-hearted, they were even more ruthless when they saw us Chinese! If you don't believe me, go and see those forty or fifty overseas Chinese households, all the young people have been abducted, every family is full of crying wives and children, there's no good life to be had! As for me, my children's father has had this misfortune, leaving behind a mother-in-law and a pile of children, even if I cry my tears dry, I still have to live!"
　　Just as she was speaking, a white shadow flashed outside the small glass window, and someone spoke. The old woman raised her voice in Korean and answered a few words. Three Korean women came into the house, each holding a small bag of rice, to exchange for Chinese cabbage. The first Korean woman had a worried face. When she saw me wearing the uniform of the Chinese People's Volunteers, she put her hand on my shoulder and looked at me kindly with sorrowful eyes, saying something. Mou's mother-in-law said: "She said she has a child, as tall as you, who joined the Korean People's Army last month, picked up a gun and left."
　　Mou's wife said to me: "You don't know, this Korean woman is really suffering too, she only had a daughter left by her side, and this time she was taken away by the enemy in a car! Look, these American soldiers, can they even be called people, they are simply a group of beasts in human skin!"
　　Her mother-in-law cursed: "I think they are a group of plague gods, wherever they go, disaster strikes!"
　　That's right, as of today, American imperialism is the embodiment of disaster. Wherever it appears, whether you are Korean, Chinese, or of any other ethnicity, you will face a common fate and face the disaster it has created. Whoever wants happiness must first defeat this plague god. It is for this reason that so many Korean youths abandon their homes and take up guns to go to the front lines! How many Chinese People's Volunteers climb mountains and cross rivers, shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, to fire together at that common enemy of mankind!

    美军是披着人皮的畜牲
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    我随铁路志愿大队到朝鲜的第二天，宿在朝鲜铁道大队参谋长的小板房里，早晨还睡在烧得烫人的地炕上，主人拧开收音机，拨到北京，里边传出个叫人狂喜的消息：“平壤解放！”
    这喜讯正面宣告了美国强盗的惨败。想想这些畜牲在发动攻势之前，从平壤到球场，摆满机械化部队，牛皮吹的天响说：“三天推到满洲去！”结果呢，我们沿路所见的却是丢掉的钢盔，钻到泥里的坦克，从火线被押送下来的美国俘虏……再就是，遍地遍野所留下的血腥的罪恶。
    北朝鲜的山水本来很好看：到处是稻田，山头长满落叶松。强盗们在败退时，稻子地里浇上火油，放起火。满山的树木被烧夷弹烧焦，一片一片的乌黑。大城小市，炸的稀烂，荒荒凉凉的不见人烟。人呢？敌人逃跑前说两天以内要用原子弹来炸，连吓带骗，死逼着朝鲜人民跟他们往南撤。但走到清川江边上，被中国人民志愿军拦腰切断，救下许多人。我们进到定州一带时，百姓们陆陆续续回家来了。在炸塌的房屋跟前，在火烧场上，常见有憔悴不堪的朝鲜男女，大冷天只穿着白色的单衣，拿手扒着死灰烂瓦，想要找到点他家里烧剩的东西。有一天晚间，地上盖着大霜，我在郭山站上看见个朝鲜小姑娘，大约有八、九岁，蜷着身子坐在路边大北风里，浑身冻得乱颤。会说朝鲜话的同志问她母亲那去了？小姑娘的嘴已经冻僵，嘴唇抖了半天说：“炸死了！”又问她父亲，她说也死了。那位同志就问：“你要到那去呢？”小姑娘悄悄说道：“不知道！”
    这就是杜鲁门之流“帮助朝鲜解放”所做的好事！不止这些，事情还多着呢。
    一个阴沉的冬天，我走过一个偏僻的小村，忽然听见背后有人叫道：“同志，快进屋暖和暖和吧，看把你冻的！”回头一看是个中国老妇人，倚在门框上朝我招手。在异国碰见了说着一种语言的人，特别亲，当时就走进去。只见炕上坐着另一个中年妇女，身旁围着三、四个小孩，我就问道：“小孩他爹呢！”那中年妇女的眼眶全是红的，哑着嗓子说：“杀啦！杀啦！叫美国强盗给杀啦！”
    原来本地有四、五十户华侨，都是从山东来的，大半种菜园子。美国大兵到后，手端着枪，打碎窗户，踢破门，挨门挨户搜，见人就拿枪顶住对方的胸膛，好不好通你个透眼透。这家姓牟，那中年妇女说她男人只穿着身破单衣藏在防空洞里，叫美国兵揪出来，连踢带打绑走了，一直没信，准没有活命！亚山脚住着个王木匠，美国兵乍到，从山头打枪，他媳妇吓的要往远处跑，一出门就被打死。王木匠把媳妇扛回来，忍着泪给她钉棺材，才钉一半，门口闯进美国兵来，把他捆走。炕上丢下个吃奶的孩子，赶黑间有个同乡冒着险去抱那孩子，伸手一摸，早冻硬了。牟家前院是老费家，有个小嫚（姑娘），才十五，还没成人，美国强盗支着枪逼住她老爹，把个小嫚糟蹋到半死。……
    最后牟家媳妇幽幽地叹道：“原先俺只说咱是华侨，也许不怕，谁知美国强盗黑了心，看见咱中国人，更狠！不信你去看看那四、五十户华侨，年轻人都给掳走，家家老婆哭，孩子叫，那有好日子过！我呢，孩子他爹这一出错，头上撇下个婆婆，下面一堆孩子，泪哭干了，也得活呀！”
    正说着，小玻璃窗外闪着白影子，有人说话，那婆婆用朝鲜话扬声应了几句。就有三个朝鲜妇女走进屋，每人拿着一小包大米，来换白菜。当头一个朝鲜妇女一脸愁容，望见我穿着中国人民志愿军的服装，把手搭在我的肩上，用愁苦的眼睛亲切地注视着我，嘴里说着什么。牟家婆婆道：“她说她有个孩子，象你一样高，大上月参加了朝鲜人民军，背起枪走了。”
    牟家媳妇对我说：“你不知道，这个朝鲜娘儿们也真苦，身边本来剩个闺女，这回叫敌人拿车装走啦！你看，美国兵这还叫人，简直是群披着人皮的畜牲！”
    他婆婆骂道：“我看是群瘟神，走到那里那里遭殃！”
    不错，就今天来说，美帝国主义就是灾难的化身，它出现在那儿，不管你是朝鲜人，中国人，或是其他民族的人，就要遭到共同的命运，面临着它一手制造的灾祸。谁要幸福，谁就得首先战胜这个瘟神。正是为着这个，多少朝鲜子弟抛家离业，拿起枪走上前线！多少中国人民志愿军爬山涉水，跟朝鲜人民军肩并着肩，向那个人类共同的敌人一齐开火！
