    People's Democratic Countries Film Week
    Concludes Successfully in Beijing

    [Report from this newspaper] The "People's Democratic Countries Film Week," organized by the Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, successfully concluded on the 18th of this month. Over eight days, it attracted a total audience of 8,000 people. This was the first time films from fraternal countries were screened in Beijing. This screening not only enhanced the unity and friendship between our country and fraternal countries and strengthened cultural exchanges, but also enabled our audiences to learn valuable experiences from fraternal countries through many films filled with construction enthusiasm.

    During the Film Week, Zhou Yang, Ding Xielin, Ding Ling, Sha Kefu and other figures from our literary and art circles visited. Foreign guests included personnel from the Czechoslovak Embassy and the Czech cultural delegation, Hungarian Embassy Attaché Fekete, Romanian Embassy First Secretary Mentianu, Polish Embassy Press Attaché Robman, Vietnamese Comrade Wu Tian, Mongolian Embassy Attaché Labudan, First Secretary Darharebu, Bulgarian Embassy Cultural Attaché Grigorov, and German Diplomatic Mission Secretary He Ruode, among others.

    Before the screenings, the Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Culture distributed "Cultural Materials of People's Democratic Countries, Collection 3" and questionnaires, inviting the audience to offer opinions on the screening work and the films. The opinions offered by the audience were unanimous in believing that films from fraternal countries should not only be introduced more, but it is hoped that further screenings will continue. It would be best to create dialogue in Chinese, to conduct public and widespread performances, penetrating into every region and factory, so that people throughout the country will have the opportunity to see the liberation struggles and construction achievements of fraternal countries, and can even more redouble their efforts to learn from them. The Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau has drafted a plan to widely introduce these films.

    人民民主国家电影周
    在京胜利闭幕
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部对外文化联络事务局此次所举办的“人民民主国家电影周”已于本月十八日胜利闭幕。放映八天，全部观众达八千人。各兄弟国家的电影在北京这是首次放映。经过这一次放映，不但增进了我国与兄弟国家间之团结与友谊，加强了文化交流，而且使我国观众从许多充满建设热忱的影片中学习兄弟国家宝贵的经验。
    在举办电影周期间，我国文艺界周扬、丁燮林、丁玲、沙可夫等均前往参观。外宾计有捷克大使馆人员及捷克文化代表团，匈牙利大使馆费凯特参赞，罗马利亚大使馆孟天努一等秘书，波兰大使馆罗布曼新闻专员，越南吴田同志，蒙古大使馆拉布丹参赞、一等秘书达尔哈热布，保加利亚大使馆格里葛洛夫文化参赞及德意志外交使团何若德秘书等数十人。
    文化部对外文化联络事务局于放映前分送“人民民主国家文化资料第三辑”与意见书，请观众对于放映工作和影片提出意见。观众们提出的意见一致认为兄弟国家的影片不但应该多予介绍，更希望继续举办。最好制成华语对白，作公开的广泛的演出，深入到每个地区和工厂方面去，使全国人民都有机会从这些影片中看到兄弟国家的解放斗争和建设成果，更能加倍努力地向他们学习。对外文化联络事务局已拟订计划，将广为介绍这些影片。
