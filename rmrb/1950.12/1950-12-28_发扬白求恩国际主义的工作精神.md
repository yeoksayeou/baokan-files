Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:
The First Group of Tianjin Medical Team to Korea Works Happily
[Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The first contingent of Tianjin's first medical team to Korea to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea brought back a lot of good news from the Korean battlefield. Among them was a reply from the team to Mayor Huang Jing and the people of Tianjin, which read: "Now our team members are all doing well, full of energy, happy, and getting fat from the food. We often use our rest time to read newspapers and books, discuss current affairs, and study medicine and Russian." The letter also said: "Please convey to our fathers, mothers, lovers, and relatives not to worry about us. We hope they will stick to their posts, intensify their work, and strive for the ultimate goal of winning the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." According to personnel returning from Korea: The medical team was warmly welcomed and carefully cared for by the Korean people everywhere. Their enthusiasm for work is very high. After officially starting work, they performed more than twenty major surgeries in six days. The nurses took very good care of the wounded. In order to ensure good work, the medical team made three rules: no drinking, no emotional outbursts, and no fear of difficulties. If violated, the most severe punishment would be to "safely send the violator back to Tianjin." The team members worked cautiously, and no one wanted to make mistakes, because no one wanted to be sent back.

Overcoming All Difficulties to Do a Good Job in Battlefield Medical Work
[Our Newspaper] Zhang Xiuying, a comrade from the Beijing Municipal Pipeline Bureau who participated in the People's Volunteer Medical Team, recently sent a letter from the Korean front, recounting her enthusiasm for working at the front. The letter stated: Our medical team's main task is to treat the wounded transferred from the front. Half of our comrades are Korean sisters, who are especially kind to people. Especially some of the older comrades and superiors in our unit, they take good care of us, so that I truly experience the warmth of a revolutionary family. Although there are some hardships in work and life, because we are mentally happy, we do not feel bitterness. Our work does not distinguish between day and night, sometimes we cannot sleep for two or three days, but we are still very happy. I have never seen such high working enthusiasm.

The wounded who come down from the front, although they are seriously injured, some with fractures, some without feet, they do not care at all, and their determination to kill the enemy is particularly firm. The wounded repeatedly asked to have their injuries healed quickly so that they could return to the battlefield to kill the enemy. The soldiers' spirit of not fearing sacrifice, courageous fighting, and steely will inspired my enthusiasm for work and deepened my hatred for U.S. imperialism. I treat the wounded like my own brothers. When I see the wounded moaning and wanting to eat, but there is no better refined food, I take out my own money prepared for incidental expenses to buy sugar and apples for the wounded to eat. When the wounded's blood-soaked clothes cannot be changed, I give the wounded my only new shirt and pants to wear. The wounded were moved to tears and said: "Comrade, I will never forget your high degree of class friendship until I die. My only repayment is that after my injury is healed, I will return to the battlefield and kill more enemies." I was moved by them, and I worked even harder and received praise from my superiors and good reviews from my comrades. In the future, I will learn politics and business from my comrades more modestly, and I will guarantee that no matter what the circumstances, I will never waver, never bow to difficulties, overcome all difficulties, and successfully complete the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country.

Shanghai Medical Workers Will Go to Korea in Five Batches to Serve
[Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Medical Workers' Committee for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, the enthusiasm for signing up to serve in Korea has developed from public hospitals to private hospitals. Currently, more than 800 medical personnel in the city have signed up to serve on the front lines in Korea. The health bureau system, including various municipal hospitals, nursing schools, and midwifery schools, has a total of more than 400 people; the Shanghai Medical College, Zhongshan Hospital, and Red Cross Hospital system has a total of 216 people; and the Tongji Medical College and Sino-American Hospital system has a total of more than 150 people. The committee plans to organize five large teams in the city and strive for three teams to depart before the end of the year. Currently, each team is studying the work of team organization and the allocation of medical equipment.

Traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in the city are currently holding mobilization meetings separately, preparing to establish branches of the Committee for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea and Defending Our Homes and Country, preparing to assist various hospitals in doing a good job in Shanghai medical work after the medical personnel from various hospitals go to Korea.

Xi'an Health Workers Hold Anti-American and Aid-Korea Conference
[Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] 1,700 health workers in Xi'an held an anti-American and aid-Korea movement conference. The participants on the spot donated more than 17,300 emergency kits and various emergency medicines to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces.

The health workers attending the meeting all expressed in their speeches: Guarantee to first do a good job in the anti-American and aid-Korea work in their own business. Feng Zesheng of the Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association said: "Health workers should learn the immortal internationalist spirit of Dr. Bethune and be ready to dedicate themselves to the world peace and democracy cause at any time."

The conference unanimously passed the "Five Patriotic Conventions of Xi'an Health Workers": 1. Eliminate the remaining consciousness of being pro-American, admiring America, fearing America, and flattering America, and establish the idea of hating, despising, and looking down on U.S. imperialism. 2. Strengthen current affairs learning and identify enemies and friends. 3. Contribute all our strength to participate in the anti-American and aid-Korea movement. 4.

    发扬白求恩国际主义的工作精神
    津首批赴朝医疗队愉快工作
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：天津市首批赴朝鲜的抗美援朝志愿医疗队第一大队，托人由朝鲜战地带回大批喜讯。其中有该队致黄敬市长及津市各界人民的复信，上面写道：“现在我们队员都很好，精神饱满、愉快，吃得也胖了，并经常利用休息时间阅读书报，座谈时事，学习医务和俄文。”信上并说：“请您转达我们的爸爸、妈妈、爱人和亲友，别惦念我们，希望他们坚守着自己的岗位，加紧工作，努力生产，同为抗美援朝胜利的目标奋斗到底。”据由朝鲜回来的人员谈：医疗队到处受到朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎和细心照顾。他们的工作热情非常高，正式开始工作后，六天内就施行了二十多个较大的手术。护士同志照顾伤员非常周到。医疗队为保证做好工作，曾约法三章：不喝酒，不闹情绪，不怕困难。如果违犯，最重的惩罚便是把违犯者“安稳地送回天津”。队员们都谨慎地工作，谁也不愿犯错误，因为谁也不愿意被送回来。
    克服一切困难作好战地医疗工作
    【本报讯】京市清管局参加人民志愿医疗队的张秀英同志，近自朝鲜前线来信，历述在前方工作的热情。来信略称：我们医疗队的主要任务，是治疗由前方转来的伤员。我们的同志二分之一是朝鲜姐妹，他们待人特别亲切，尤其是一些老同志，和本单位的上级，对我们照顾得都很周到，使我真正地体会了革命大家庭的温暖。虽然工作和生活上有些艰苦，但因精神愉快，所以并不感到苦。我们的工作，不分昼夜，有时两三昼夜不能睡觉，但仍然是高高兴兴。这样高昂的工作情绪，是我从来没有看到过的。
    由前方下来的伤员，虽然身体受到重伤，有的骨折，有的没脚，但他们一点也不在意，杀敌的心特别坚定。伤员们再三要求快把伤治好，以便重上战场去杀敌人。战士们不怕牺牲、英勇战斗的精神和钢铁般的意志，鼓舞了我的工作热情，加深了我对美帝国主义的仇恨。我把伤员看成自己的亲兄弟一般，我看到伤员呻吟着要吃东西，但却没有更好的细粮，我便把我自己带来准备零用的钱拿出来给伤员买糖、买苹果吃。伤员的血衣换不下来，我便把我仅有的新衬衣裤给伤员穿了。伤员感动得落泪说：“同志，你这高度的阶级友爱，我到死也不会忘掉。我唯一的报答是我伤医好后，重上战场，多杀敌人。”我受了他们的感动，便更努力工作，受到了上级的表扬和同志的好评。我今后要更虚心地向同志们学习政治和业务，保证无论在什么情况下，决不动摇，决不向困难低头，克服一切困难，胜利完成抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务。
