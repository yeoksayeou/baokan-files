Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: Under the victorious counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the American and Syngman Rhee gangs in Seoul are terrified and have begun to flee south. South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee announced on the 7th that martial law had been imposed throughout South Korea from midnight on the 6th. The South Korean puppet government also "advised" all families of South Korean soldiers and police to evacuate from Seoul immediately on the 6th. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Seoul on the 5th admitted that "Seoul is currently filled with an atmosphere of panic and pessimism." Reuters also revealed on the 6th that the liberation of Pyongyang "has caused a small number of people to flee south in panic," and "the rich and powerful have all slipped out the back door to Busan." Despite the high price of tickets to Busan, they "are still in short supply. Black market prices have doubled." A United Press dispatch from Kalischer, who had just fled to Seoul, said on the 6th with trepidation that the "American non-military personnel" in Seoul and the "prominent officials" of the Syngman Rhee regime were also "packing their luggage."
