    Land Reform, Organize, Develop Agricultural Production
    Land Reform in Nanhu and Quanmei Townships, Changde County
    Nanhu and Quanmei Townships in Changde County, Hunan Province, have victoriously completed land reform, realizing the goal of "land to the tiller." The land reform in both townships was completed after fully mobilizing the peasants and going through a fierce struggle.

    Nanhu and Quanmei are the two townships in Changde Prefecture selected for pilot land reform projects, located in the fertile area on the west bank of Dongting Lake. Since liberation, the peasants in both townships had been initially mobilized; although the feudal forces had been weakened, they still existed to a serious extent. Before this year's autumn harvest, the Changde Prefecture land reform work team arrived in the two townships to implement land reform. At that time, the work team started by leading the peasants to solve urgent production needs (treating rice borers), carrying out land reform propaganda, and mobilizing the peasants. This way, the work team not only quickly established close ties with the peasants in the two townships but also made the propaganda of the Land Reform Law more profound. Then, the work team started by summarizing this spring's rent reduction to rectify the peasant associations in the two townships.

    Difficulties were encountered when the land reform pilot project reached the stage of class division. Landlords attempted to lower their class status, secretly dispersing land and property, threatening peasants on the one hand, and using feudal relationships such as clans to win over peasants on the other. When meetings were held to divide classes, landlords engaged in sophistry, and poor peasants and farm laborers mostly remained silent, making it impossible to conduct reasoned struggles.

    As the autumn harvest approached, the work team shifted its focus to leading the autumn harvest and tax collection, seeking to further penetrate the peasants and investigate the reasons for the landlords' resistance and the failure to properly divide classes. After in-depth investigation, the work team found that the peasants were still apprehensive ideologically due to the landlords' rumors and threats, and the superstitious beliefs and fatalistic views of the poor peasants had not been eliminated. Unlawful landlords further exposed their sabotage activities during the autumn tax collection. The problem was very clear: the fundamental key to the unsuccessful progress of land reform lay in the fact that the masses had not been fully mobilized and the reactionary arrogance of the landlord class had not been beaten down.

    After reviewing the tendency to neglect the mobilization of poor peasants and farm laborers, the work team held a poor peasant and farm laborer congress in the two townships, with the participation of middle peasant representatives. The work team and the responsible cadres of the two township peasant associations made self-criticisms to the masses, listened to their criticisms, and inspired the masses to pour out their grievances. In the process of pouring out grievances, the peasants' awareness gradually increased, accusing the landlords of cruel exploitation and revealing the history of the evil wealth of individual local despotic landlords in the two townships. After the peasants further understood the root causes of their poverty and suffering, they became more resentful of the past oppression and exploitation by the landlord class and more indignant at the landlords' sophistry, and they demanded to reason with the landlords. At this time, a few unlawful landlords were still playing tricks, such as inviting monks to chant scriptures, burning incense and worshiping Buddha, and setting off firecrackers, vainly attempting to continue to confuse the peasants with superstition, "divine spirits," and "retribution," but they all failed. The peasants of Quanmei Township rose up to conduct a reasoned struggle against the despotic landlord Chu Defu. At the meeting, more than thirty victims accused Chu of his crimes, and the evidence was conclusive, forcing Chu to bow his head and confess his guilt. Other landlords who had resisted and sabotaged land reform also confessed their mistakes.

    In this way, the work of dividing classes, confiscating and requisitioning, and distributing land and property in the two townships was able to proceed smoothly. After the land distribution, excluding rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, the average land per person in the two townships was between two and three mu. Luo Longhua, a poor peasant in Nanhu Township, whose family of twelve had never owned even one mu of land in the past, now received thirty mu of paddy fields. He had already called back his two sons who were herding cattle for others to farm the land and had taken back a younger son who had been given away to go to school. Now, the peasants in the two townships are all satisfied and expressed that they must produce well next year. The peasant associations in the two townships have become stronger and more powerful, with a total of more than 1,450 members, accounting for more than 40% of all peasants. The township administrative committees in the two townships were also re-elected after the land reform. In Quanmei Township, thirteen peasant cadres who had been tested in the movement were elected. The militia has also been strengthened, and seven young peasants in Quanmei Township voluntarily signed up to join the local forces of the People's Liberation Army.

    The Development of Mutual Aid Organizations in Old Liberated Areas of North China
    With the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production and in order to adapt to the peasants' new demands for further increasing production, rural labor mutual aid organizations in the old liberated areas of North China have generally developed this year. The number of peasant households organized in Shanxi Province has increased from 40% this spring to over 60%. In Licheng County of that province, over 95% of the labor and livestock power has been organized. In many rural areas of the old liberated areas of Hebei Province, the number of peasant households organized has also reached 80%.

    As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government, rural labor mutual aid organizations in North China were relatively common, playing a certain role in maintaining agricultural production and supporting the Anti-Japanese War. After the land reform in 1948, in the two years of the great production movement, labor mutual aid organizations became the main link in overcoming labor and livestock power difficulties and restoring and developing agricultural production. Therefore, labor mutual aid organizations have a deep influence and mass base in the vast rural areas of North China.

    In the past two years, due to the rapid recovery of the agricultural economy in the old liberated areas of North China and the gradual enrichment of peasant life, the vast number of peasants have put forward new demands for further increasing production and becoming rich. Based on this demand, local leading organs, in addition to continuing to implement the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit in mutual aid groups, also timely proposed this spring the new content of closely combining labor mutual aid with technological improvement and sideline production, so that the labor mutual aid in various places continued to develop this year.

    The combination of rural labor mutual aid and new technology in North China has brought agricultural production in the old liberated areas into a new period. In this year's agricultural production, many mutual aid groups in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, and other provinces have carried out technical improvement work such as trying out new farm tools, promoting improved varieties, seed disinfection, intensive cultivation, processing and fertilizing, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, which has improved the labor efficiency of the mutual aid group peasants and increased output. Therefore, the mutual aid groups are more consolidated and developed. The Zhang Zhiquan mutual aid group in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, experimented with the use of seventeen kinds of fertilizers and tried out fourteen kinds of indigenous insecticides, which greatly increased the output of the whole group this year. The Dagangwen Village mutual aid group in Anguo County, Hebei Province, studied technical problems such as plowing, sowing, and weeding according to the agricultural season, making the mutual aid group the core for the masses to improve technology. Therefore, more than half of the labor force in the whole village participated in the mutual aid group.

    Due to the combination with sideline production, labor mutual aid organizations in various places have found production avenues for a large number of surplus laborers in rural areas. Peasants in various places have saved a large number of laborers this year due to the organization of labor exchange and mutual aid. Many areas, based on their local specific conditions, organized this batch of surplus laborers separately to carry out sideline and handicraft production such as transportation, oil pressing, weaving, and workshops, enriching the content of labor exchange and mutual aid. Moreover, seasonal agricultural mutual aid groups have become year-round mutual aid groups combining agriculture and sideline industries. In many areas, mutual aid groups have been greatly developed and consolidated due to their combination with sideline industries.

    The strengthening of economic assistance to mutual aid groups by supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of North China has played a significant role in the consolidation and development of mutual aid groups. In addition to supplying mutual aid groups with living and production materials in a planned way this year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also worked hard to open up sales channels for the surplus agricultural and sideline products of mutual aid groups and organized surplus rural labor to engage in sideline production. For example, the supply and marketing cooperatives in two districts of Lin County, Pingyuan Province, signed more than 100 contracts for exchange, purchasing, and sales with mutual aid groups this spring, helping mutual aid groups sell a large number of sideline products such as native cloth, hemp, and straw hats; at the same time, they also assisted mutual aid groups in organizing transportation production; thus, more than 2,000 of the more than 6,000 temporary agricultural mutual aid groups in the county developed into year-round mutual aid groups combining agriculture and sideline industries.

    The First Agricultural Exhibition of Hebei Province
    At the end of November, concurrently with the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference, the first Hebei Provincial Agricultural Exhibition opened in Baoding. The exhibition displays many excellent products from the hard work of farmers and labor models throughout the year, and the content is quite rich. As Hebei Province Vice Chairman Li Xijiu said at the opening ceremony, this exhibition is a great review of the power of 20 million farmers in the province in 1950.

    Walking into the exhibition hall, from many charts, comic strips, models, and agricultural products, it is explained that although Hebei Province has suffered from the destruction of the past ten years of war, and the level of agricultural production has fallen by a quarter compared to before the war, and this year it has suffered from severe floods, but the 20 million farmers in Hebei Province, with the assistance of the People's Government lending more than 500 million jin of grain, have carried out water conservancy construction, improved technology, organized labor mutual aid, and expanded cultivated land area, and have overcome various disasters, so that the province's agricultural production has achieved an 80% harvest this year. The province produced a total of 14.7 billion jin of grain this year, reaching 102% of pre-war production; produced more than 3.58 million dan of ginned cotton, reaching 181% of the average output of the seven years before the war (1931-37), victoriously overfulfilling this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks.

    It can be seen from the photos and models in the exhibition that perennial floods are the main enemy of Hebei farmers engaged in agricultural production. This year, the farmers of Hebei Province have been engaged in a resolute struggle against floods. In the spring, when the spring famine was still very serious, the farmers of Hebei Province, in conjunction with spring plowing and sideline production, completed the huge river management and embankment construction project of 26 million cubic meters of earth with perseverance. During the summer flood season, heavy rain fell throughout the province, mountain torrents broke out, and river levels rose. At this time, another 300,000 farmers and more than 3,000 cadres in the province invested in the flood control movement, working hard for as long as three months. Although this year's rainfall and the water level and flow of the main rivers exceeded last year, the affected area was ultimately reduced by half compared to last year.

    In terms of developing water conservancy and irrigation, Hebei farmers applied organized strength to vigorously open canals and dig wells, so as to prevent drought and increase production. Over the past year, farmers in the province have opened 138 canals, dug new wells and repaired old wells more than 25,000, and added more than 40,000 waterwheels, turning 1.28 million mu of dry land into paddy fields. The figures on the charts indicate that these paddy fields increased grain production in the province by 47 million jin this year.

    In the agricultural technology improvement exhibition hall, thousands of exhibits represent the great creations of the peasants, vividly describing the great achievements of Hebei peasants in improving production technology: the peasants of Niangniangmiao Village in Daming County, under the leadership of labor model Zhang Xishun, organized various technical research groups such as seeds, fertilizers, pest control, animal husbandry, and well digging; this year, all crops in the village were sown with improved varieties, and seed soaking and seed dressing were universally implemented before sowing; when insect pests occurred this summer, they also used pesticides and indigenous methods to control insects in a timely manner, which greatly increased crop yields. The average yield of dry land in the village was 490 jin per mu, and the yield of paddy land reached 850 jin. The famous labor model Gao Guandou led the farmers of the whole village to improve the soil, so that each mu of alkaline land could harvest 100 jin of cotton. At the meeting, there was also cotton bearing more than 100 cotton bolls sent to the conference for exhibition by the peasants of Zhaoxian County, and a large pumpkin weighing more than 50 jin grown by a twelve-year-old farmer's child in Qian'an County. All of these are only part of the great creations of Hebei farmers.

    The charts further illustrate that more than 100,000 labor models and production experts have emerged throughout the province this year, and tens of thousands of technical research groups have been organized. They have closely united and led the vast number of peasants to engage in agricultural technology improvement in all agricultural activities throughout the year. In the insect control campaign alone, 7.2 million farmers participated, completely eliminating pests on 6.69 million mu of crops, thereby increasing grain production by 170 million jin.

    The exhibition of the deeds of labor mutual aid models more vividly tells everyone that the "organization" instructed by Chairman Mao is indeed a good way for the masses of peasants to overcome difficulties and develop production. Under the leadership of labor model Ren Qingmei, the peasants of Xiaoyetao Village in Wu'an County organized themselves this year to help each other reclaim wasteland, open canals, engage in sideline production, and improve technology. The agricultural production level of the whole village has exceeded more than double the pre-war level. This year, the labor force participating in mutual aid groups in Hebei Province has reached 40% of the total, and it is still developing rapidly.

### 土地改革，组织起来，发展农业生产

    土地改革，组织起来，发展农业生产
    常德县南湖、全美两乡的土地改革
    湖南省常德县的南湖乡和全美乡，已经胜利地完成了土地改革，实现了耕者有其田。两个乡的土地改革，都是在充分发动农民，经过一场激烈的斗争之后才完成的。
    南湖和全美是常德专区试办土地改革的两个乡，位于洞庭湖西岸的富饶地区。解放以来，两乡农民都已初步发动起来；封建势力虽经削弱，但仍严重地存在着。今年秋收以前，常德专区的土地改革工作队到达两乡实行土地改革。当时，工作队从领导农民解决生产上的迫切要求（治螟虫）着手，进行土地改革宣传和发动农民。这样，工作队不但迅速取得了和两乡农民的密切联系，并使土地改革法的宣传比较深入。接着，工作队又从总结今春的减租做起，整顿了两乡的农民协会。
    土地改革试点工作在进行到划分阶级时遇到了困难。地主企图降低自己的阶级成份，暗地分散土地、财产，一面威胁农民，一面又利用宗族等封建关系拉拢农民。开会划阶级时，地主就进行狡辩，贫农和雇农多不发言，说理斗争不能开展。
    这时秋收已到，工作队即转而领导秋收和秋征，以求进一步深入到农民中去，研究地主顽抗、阶级未划好的原因。经深入调查，工作队发现农民在地主的造谣威胁下思想上仍有顾虑，贫苦农民的迷信、命运观念仍未消除。不法地主也在秋征中进一步暴露了他们的破坏活动。问题已经非常明白：土地改革所以不能顺利进行基本关键在于群众仍未充分地发动起来，地主阶级的反动气焰未被打落下去。
    工作队在检讨了忽视发动贫农和雇农的偏向后，又在两乡分别召开有中农代表参加的贫雇农大会，由工作队和两乡农民协会的负责干部向群众作检讨，听取群众的批评，并启发群众诉苦。诉苦中农民觉悟逐步提高，控诉了地主的残酷剥削，揭露了两乡个别恶霸地主的罪恶的发家史。农民们在进一步明白了自己受穷受苦的根源后，对于地主阶级过去的压迫和剥削就更加仇恨，对地主的狡辩更加愤慨，纷纷要求和地主讲理。这时，少数不法地主还在玩弄花样，如请和尚念经、烧香拜佛、大放鞭炮等等，妄想继续以迷信、以“神灵”“报应”等迷惑农民，但都失败了。全美乡农民起来对恶霸地主褚德甫进行说理斗争。开会时三十多个苦主指控褚的罪行，事证确凿，使褚不得不低头认罪。其他曾进行抵抗破坏土地改革的地主也纷纷承认了错误。
    这样，两乡的划分阶级、没收征收和分配土地财物等工作才得以顺利进行。分田后，除富农和富裕中农外，两乡每人平均土地在二亩到三亩之间。南湖乡贫农罗隆华，一家十二口人过去一亩田也没有，现在分得三十亩稻田。他已把给人家放牛的两个儿子叫回种田，又把过去送了人的一个小儿子领回上学。现在两乡农民无不称心如意，表示明年一定要好好生产。两乡的农民协会已更加坚强有力，会员共达一千四百五十多人，占全体农民百分之四十以上。两乡的乡政委员会也在土地改革后改选了，全美乡就有十三个在运动中经过考验的农民干部当选。民兵也已加强，全美乡并有七个青年农民自愿报名参加了人民解放军的地方部队。
    华北老区农村互助组织的发展
    华北老区农村劳动互助组织，随着农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，和适应农民进一步增产的新要求，今年普遍获得发展。山西全省组织起来的农户由今春的百分之四十已增至百分之六十以上。该省黎城县组织起来的劳畜力达百分之九十五以上。河北省老区不少农村组织起来的农户亦达百分之八十。
    早在抗日战争时期，在抗日民主政府的领导下华北农村劳动互助组织即比较普遍，对于维持农业生产和支援抗日战争起了一定的作用。一九四八年土地改革后，在两年来的大生产运动中，劳动互助组织更成为克服劳畜力困难和恢复发展农业生产的主要环节。因此，劳动互助组织在华北广大农村有其深厚的影响和群众基础。
    最近两年来，由于华北老区农业经济迅速恢复，农民生活日渐富裕，广大农民又提出进一步增产致富的新要求。各地领导机关根据这一要求，除在互助组中继续贯彻自愿两利的政策外，并于今春及时提出劳动互助与改良技术和副业生产紧密结合的新内容，使今年各地的劳动互助继续发展。
    华北农村劳动互助与新的技术相结合，使老区农业生产进入一个新的时期。山西、河北、平原等省不少互助组在今年的农业生产中，均进行了试用新农具、推广良种、种籽消毒、精耕细作、加工加肥、防治病虫害等技术改良工作，使互助组农民的劳动效率提高，增加了产量，因而，互助组更加巩固和发展。山西榆社县张志全互助组实验了十七种肥料的用法，并试用了十四种土制杀虫剂，使全组今年产量大大提高。河北省安国大文村互助组按农事季节研究耕、种、锄等技术问题，使互助组成为群众改良技术的核心，因此，全村半数以上的劳力都参加了互助组。
    各地劳动互助组织由于与副业生产结合，使农村中的大批剩余劳动力找到生产门路。各地农民因为组织变工互助，今年节省了大批劳动力。许多地区依据本地具体情况，将这批剩余劳动力分别组织起来，进行运输、榨油、编织、作坊等副业与手工业生产，使变工互助的内容丰富多样，并且，使季节性的农业互助组，成为农副业结合的常年互助组。不少地区的互助组，因和副业结合而获得大量发展和更加巩固。
    华北各地供销合作社加强给互助组的经济扶助，对互助组的巩固和发展起了重大作用。各地供销合作社今年除有计划地供给互助组生活与生产资料外，并努力为互助组的剩余农副产品打开销路以及组织农村剩余劳动力进行副业生产。如平原林县两个区的供销合作社，今春曾与互助组订立交换、代购、代销合同约百余件，帮助互助组推销了土布、大麻、草帽等大批副业产品；同时还扶助互助组组织运输生产；因而使该县六千多个临时农业互助组中有两千余个发展成为农副业结合的常年互助组。
    河北省第一届农业展览会
    十一月底，与河北省农业劳动模范会议同时，河北省第一届农业展览会在保定开幕了。展览会里面陈列着很多农民和劳动模范一年辛勤得来的优良产品，内容相当丰富。正如河北省李锡九副主席在开幕典礼上所说的，这个展览会是一九五○年全省两千万农民力量的大检阅。
    走进展览会场，从许多图表、连环画、模型、以及农产品等等说明：河北全省虽然遭受了过去十余年战争的破坏，农业生产水平曾比战前下降了四分之一，今年又遭到严重的水灾，但河北省两千多万农民，在人民政府贷放五亿多斤粮食的扶助下，曾进行了兴修水利、改良技术、组织劳动互助、扩大耕地面积等工作，战胜了各种灾害，使今年全省农业生产获得八成年景。全省今年共生产粮食一百四十七亿斤，达到战前产量的百分之一百零二；出产皮棉三百五十八万余担，达到战前七年（一九三一——三七）平均产量的百分之一百八十一，胜利地超额完成了今年的粮棉增产任务。
    从展览会中的照片和模型中可以看出：历年水灾是河北农民从事农业生产的主要敌人。今年一年来河北省的农民曾连续地与水灾进行了坚决的斗争。春季，当春荒还很严重时，河北省农民就结合着春耕和副业生产，坚毅地完成了两千六百万公方土的巨大的治河修堤工程。夏汛的时候，全省普降大雨，山洪暴发，河水上涨，这时全省又有三十万农民和三千多干部投入防汛运动中去，艰苦奋斗达三个月之久。虽然今年的雨量和主要河流的水位、流量都超过去年，但终使受灾面积比去年减少了一半。
    在发展水利灌溉方面，河北农民应用组织起来的力量，大力开渠打井，做到防旱增产。一年来全省农民共开渠一百三十八道，打水井和修旧井二万五千余眼，添置水车四万余辆，将一百二十八万亩旱地变成水田，图表上的数字标明：这些水田使今年全省增产了粮食四千七百万斤。
    在改良农业技术的展览馆中，数千件展览品都代表着农民的伟大创造，它们生动地描述了河北农民在提高生产技术上的伟大成就：大名县娘娘庙村农民在劳动模范张希顺的领导下，组织成种籽、肥料、除虫、畜牧、打井等各个技术研究组；今年全村的作物都用良种播种，播种前还普遍实行了浸种和拌种；今夏虫害发生时，他们又及时用农药和土法除虫，这样就大大提高了作物的产量，全村平均旱地每亩收粮四百九十斤，水地竟收到八百五十斤。著名的劳动模范高贯斗，领导全村农民改良了土壤，使每亩碱地能收一百斤棉花。会场上还有赵县农民送给大会展览的结了一百多个棉桃的棉花，以及迁安县一个十二岁的农家小孩种的一个五十多斤重的大南瓜。所有这些仅仅是河北农民伟大创造的一部分。
    图表进一步说明了：全省今年涌现出十几万劳动模范和生产能手，组织了几万个技术研究组，他们在全年的各项农事活动中都紧紧地团结和领导着广大农民从事农业技术的改良。单单治虫运动一项，参加的农民就有七百二十万人，将六百六十九万亩庄稼上的害虫全部扑灭，从而增产粮食一亿七千万斤。
    劳动互助模范的事迹的展览馆中，更生动地告诉大家：毛主席所指示的“组织起来”，确是农民群众战胜困难发展生产的好办法。武安县小冶陶村农民在劳动模范任清美的领导下，今年都分别组织起来，互助垦荒、开渠、搞副业生产和提高技术，全村的农业生产水平已比战前超过一倍以上。今年河北省参加互助组的劳动力已达到总数的百分之四十，现在还在很快地发展着。
