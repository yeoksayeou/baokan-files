Xiangyuan and Ji Counties Hold Agricultural Exhibitions
    Increase Farmers' Production Enthusiasm

    "... Summarize this year's production through comparison campaigns, exhibitions, symposiums, labor model conferences, people's representative conferences, and farmer representative conferences from the bottom up. Clearly affirm this year's production achievements and draw specific experiences and lessons. Such a summary is the best mobilization for carrying out winter production, and also the best preparation for determining next year's production plan and carrying out next year's production campaign."
      -- Instructions from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on carrying out winter agricultural production work

    [This newspaper reports] Xiangyuan in Shanxi Province and Ji County in Pingyuan Province have successively held agricultural exhibitions, which are of great educational significance to the masses and lay a more favorable foundation for carrying out a large-scale production campaign next year. The above-mentioned agricultural exhibitions in both counties were held at the time of their respective county's labor model conferences. Xiangyuan held its exhibition from November 2nd to 6th, and Ji County from November 13th to 19th.

    The materials arranged in the exhibition hall were all real people and real events. Xiangyuan used pictures and specimens to show the deeds of labor models, water conservancy construction, pests and diseases, improved varieties, new agricultural tools, and improved agricultural techniques, with explanations by instructors. Over the five days, a total of 11,800 people visited the exhibition. Through this exhibition, the masses further understood the importance of improving agricultural technology. A visiting farmer, Wang Libao, confirmed the excellence of the "Golden Queen" corn variety from his own experience. He planted 0.9 mu this year and harvested three shi [approximately 300 lbs], which was two shi more than other farmers who planted local corn varieties. He said that he would plant more next year. He said: The government promotes improved varieties and teaches us to select seeds, soak seeds, and mix seeds, all to help us harvest more grain. An old lady in the Second District was curious when she saw the different sizes of grain ears in the pictures. The instructor told her in detail: The small grain ears were because the land was not weeded, and the large grain ears were because it was weeded more often. New agricultural tools were the most popular among the visiting farmers. After the instructor explained the usage and effectiveness of the straw cutter, the surrounding farmers said: It cuts more than 3,000 jin [approximately 3,300 lbs] a day, which is really fast and good. It not only saves effort, but it is also good for the livestock to eat. Farmers also crowded around the threshing machine, seven-inch plough, weeder, and sprayer, asking the instructors to explain them in detail. In summarizing the achievements of this exhibition, the county pointed out: This exhibition was very enlightening for the farmers: 1. The comparison of the deeds of labor models and the production achievements of Li Changcheng, who was organized, and Cui Genxi, who worked independently, made the farmers clearly realize the glory of labor and the benefits of being organized. 2. The comparison of good and bad crops made the farmers affirm that they could only harvest more grain by improving technology. Many visiting farmers are preparing to plant more "Golden Queen" corn, "Bald Red Wheat" wheat and other improved varieties in the future. 3. Through the exhibition of new agricultural tools, the farmers' conservative thinking was broken, and there was a universal demand for the use of new agricultural tools. This laid a good foundation for the promotion of new agricultural tools in the future.

    More than 70,000 people visited the Ji County exhibition hall in seven days. Visitors were most interested in the Si character cotton among the exhibits. Many people asked the instructors where to buy it. The improved chicken breed, Leghorn chicken, was also loved by the masses.

    襄垣汲县举办农业展览
    提高农民生产热情
    “……将今年的生产通过评比运动、展览会、座谈会、劳动模范会、人民代表会、农民代表会等自下而上地加以总结，明确肯定今年的生产成绩，得出具体的经验教训，这样的总结就是开展冬季生产最好的动员，也是确定明年生产计划和开展明年生产运动最好的准备。”
      ——中央人民政府农业部关于开展冬季农业生产工作的指示
    【本报讯】山西省襄垣、平原省汲县先后举办农业展览，对群众教育意义很大，为明年开展大生产运动，奠定了更有利的基础。上述两县农业展览，都是在各该县召开劳模大会之际举行的。襄垣举办时间为十一月二日至六日，汲县为十一月十三至十九日。
    展览馆中所布置的材料，都是真人真事。襄垣将劳模事迹、水利建设、病虫害、优良品种、新式农具、改良农业技术等，以图片、标本通过说明员进行说明。五天中参观者共达一万一千八百余人。通过这次展览，群众更进一步了解到改进农业技术的重要性。参观者农民王里保从亲身体验中证实了“金皇后”玉米品种的优良。他今年种了九分，打了三石，比其他种植本地玉米的农民多打两石。他表示明年还要多种些。他说：政府推广优良品种，教咱们选种，浸种，拌种，都是为了让咱们多打粮食。二区一位老太太看到图片上的大小不同的谷穗觉得奇怪，说明员就详细告诉她：小谷穗是因为没锄地，大谷穗是因为锄的遍数多。新式农具最受参观农民欢迎。说明员解释了铡草机的使用法与效能之后，围观的农民说：一天铡三千多斤，真是又快又好，不光省工夫，牲口吃着也好。脱粒机、七寸步犁、耘锄、喷雾器旁也满挤着农民，指三问四地要求说明员解释。该县在总结此次展览成绩时指出：此次展览对农民启发很大：一、劳模事迹和组织起来的李长成与单干户崔艮喜生产成绩的对比，使农民清楚地认识到劳动光荣和组织起来的好处。二、好坏农作物的对比，农民肯定了只有改进技术才能多打粮。很多参观农民都准备今后多种“金皇后”玉米、“秃红麦”小麦等优良品种。三、经过新式农具的展览，打破了农民的保守思想，普遍要求使用新式农具。这为今后推广新式农具奠定了良好基础。
    汲县展览馆，在七天中到有观众七万多人。参观者对展品中的斯字棉最感兴趣。很多人问说明员到那里去买。优良鸡种莱克亨鸡也为广大群众所喜爱。
