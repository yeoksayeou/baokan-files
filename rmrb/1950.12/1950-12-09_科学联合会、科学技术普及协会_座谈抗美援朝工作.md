    Science Federation, Science and Technology Popularization Association
    Hold Symposium on Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] The Joint Propaganda Committee of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Dissemination convened a symposium today, inviting representatives from ten specialized societies, including the Geological Society of China, as well as science workers and representatives from relevant industrial and cultural departments in the capital, totaling more than sixty people. The symposium focused on how to concentrate the strength of the scientific community to solve practical problems for the national defense production front and how to do a good job in the scientific community's anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work in coordination with the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement. Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, Liang Xi, Chairman of the Association for Science and Technology Dissemination, as well as Ding Xilin, Zhu Kezhen, Lu Yudao, and Ye Qisun, attended and spoke at the meeting. Li Siguang pointed out in his speech that the important task of scientific workers at present should be to accelerate the removal of the remaining American and British capitalist viewpoints in the minds of scientific workers; and to make the greatest efforts to carry out anti-American imperialist propaganda work, using scientific knowledge to eliminate the fear of America that exists among some of the masses. Liang Xi said: At present, all work should be subordinate to the requirements of national defense, and the science of the motherland must grow stronger in the struggle against American imperialism. The meeting raised and discussed the practical problems that urgently need to be solved in serving national defense construction and production. The scientific workers attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the Association for Science and Technology Dissemination should call on the scientific community to concentrate their efforts to participate in the practical work of the national defense and production fronts and strive to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation; they requested the government to establish institutions to closely connect scientific workers in various places to serve the practical work of national defense and production fronts; and called on the scientific community to convene joint meetings in various places to discuss the mobilization work of the scientific community.
