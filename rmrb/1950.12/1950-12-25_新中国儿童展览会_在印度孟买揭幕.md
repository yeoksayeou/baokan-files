Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 21st: The New China Children's Exhibition opened on the 19th at the Apollo Bunder Hall in Bombay, India. The exhibition was organized by the Bombay weekly "Blitz" and Mr. D.N. Pritt, Vice-Chairman of the British National Peace Committee, who is currently visiting India, was invited to preside over the opening ceremony.

The Indian people, especially the broad masses of women and children, eagerly look forward to learning about the situation in New China. After the Chinese Children's Exhibition Room at the Bombay Children's Exhibition, hosted by the All-India Women's Conference in early November, was unreasonably closed by the Indian side, many citizens of Bombay expressed their hope to see these exhibits from New China. Under the urgent demands and support of the local masses, "Blitz" weekly decided to hold this large-scale New China Children's Exhibition in Bombay. After the exhibition in Bombay, the exhibits will be rotated and exhibited in major cities such as Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, and Lucknow.

    印度人民，特别是广大的妇女和儿童群众，热烈地盼望着了解新中国的情况。在印度妇女会议十一月初所主持的孟买儿童展览会的中国儿童展览室遭印度方面无理封闭后，孟买许多市民都表示希望能着到这些来自新中国的展览品。《闪电》周刊社在当地群众的迫切要求与支持下，乃决定在孟买举办这个大规模的新中国儿童展览会。展览品在孟买展览后将在加尔各答、德里、马德拉斯、勒克瑙等大城市轮回展览。
