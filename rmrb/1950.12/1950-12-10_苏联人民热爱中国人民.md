    Soviet People Love the Chinese People
    ·Li He·
    The Soviet people love the Chinese people who are fighting.
    "A brotherly salute to the great Chinese people who have won national freedom and independence and are victoriously consolidating the people's democratic system!" This slogan, which concentratedly expresses the Soviet people's deep friendship for the Chinese people, was hung all over the streets and railway stations throughout the Soviet Union on the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution. On the evening of November 6th, when Marshal Bulganin delivered a speech at the October Festival celebration at the Moscow Grand Theatre, mentioning that "the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are actively striving for the cause of peace," the applause from the audience lasted for a long time. On November 7th, in Red Square, the portraits of Chinese people's leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai, along with the portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU, were raised high in the torrent of the masses; the voices of brotherly greetings to the great Chinese people resounded throughout the crowd; bright flowers waved like brocade ribbons to the Chinese representatives in the stands; Chinese comrades who approached the parade were thrown into the air like relatives...
    Now, one of the most concerned and heavily featured news items in the Soviet newspapers is the vigorous movement of the Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country.
    The Soviet people not only cheer for every political and economic achievement of New China but also care for and love Chinese culture, and strive for Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges. The recent Chinese Art Exhibition held in Moscow was visited by 200,000 people in one and a half months. They deeply praised the long-standing culture of the Chinese nation and the correct realistic path taken by modern Chinese artists. Alexander Gerasimov, president of the Soviet National Academy of Art, regarded this Chinese Art Exhibition as "the progress of friendship between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union." On November 9th, at a symposium on the Chinese Art Exhibition held in Moscow, Academician Chegodaev of the Academy of Sciences commented on the modern art section of the Chinese Art Exhibition. He praised Dong Xiwen's "Production for Self-Salvation," Wu Zuoren's "Portrait of Li Yong," and Ye Qianyu's "Fake Grave." He said: Zhao Yu's "Red Flag" and Yan Han's "Unyielding People" come from the life of the people, so they are very touching; Dai Ze's "Peace Signature" moves the viewers because of its good content. As for woodcuts, he believes that the techniques are superb, clearly expressing the life and struggle of the people, such as the works of Gu Yuan, Li Hua, and Yan Han, which are quite proud of. Gu Yuan's "Human Bridge" is particularly vivid, which cannot be created by imagination. He wished Chinese sculpture and comics more writers and achievements. Soviet artists provide opinions to our artists in this way, just like their own people.
    Not long ago, at a tea party of the Soviet Writers' Association, the负责人 of the Writers' Association talked about the plan to publish Chinese works. The National Literary Publishing Bureau is planning to publish the first volume of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin" in 1951, and is preparing to publish more works by Lu Xun. In order to translate better, it is planned to adopt the method of cooperation between writers and translators, and a long list has been drawn up. A Lithuanian writer said: Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village" and Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" have been translated into Lithuanian and published.
    From August to November, the Soviet screen has screened films such as "Daughters of China," "Radiant," "Invisible Front," and "Victory of the Chinese People." The realistic reflection of people's lives and struggles and the high degree of ideological nature are the reasons why Chinese films are welcomed by the Soviet people. From November 12th, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe performed in Moscow for two weeks. Their superb skills were warmly welcomed.
    On the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Soviet radio broadcasted for the first time the chorus "Free China," composed by Kolchmarev and with lyrics by the poet Matusovsky. This song is divided into four parts. The first part narrates the Chinese guerrillas and the growth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    Our ranks
        Are incomparably strong
        Growing stronger in battle.
    The people follow them,
        The truth belongs to them,
    Only the brave
        Will win.
    The second part, "The Great Wall," uses this to compare China's greatness and strength:
    The Great Wall,
        Has encountered many dangerous storms,
        And experienced many difficulties;
    It has not succumbed for centuries,
        It has persevered.
    The third part is a song of the young generation of China, praising their construction of a new free life. The last part, "Chinese Youth," praises the joy of free labor. The chorus ends with victorious lyrics:
    Advance fearlessly,
        Towards a certain direction!
        The five stars on your flag
        Shine with brilliant victory.
                                                     [Xinhua News Agency]

    苏联人民热爱中国人民
    ·李何·
    苏联人民热爱着战斗中的中国人民。
    “向已经赢得国家的自由与独立，并胜利地巩固人民民主制度的伟大中国人民致兄弟的敬礼！”这个集中表现出苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊的标语，在十月革命三十三周年纪念日，挂遍了全苏各地的街头和火车站。十一月六日晚，当布尔加宁元帅在莫斯科大戏院十月节庆祝会上发表演说，讲到“伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导之下，正在为和平事业而积极奋斗”的时候，全场掌声历久不绝。十一月七日，在红场上，中国人民领袖毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来的画像，随着马、恩、列、斯和联共中央政治局委员的画像，在群众队伍的洪流中高举着；向伟大中国人民致兄弟敬礼的声音在人海中响彻着；鲜艳的花朵如同锦带向看台上的中国代表挥动着；走近游行行列的中国同志像亲人般被抛到半空……。
    现在，苏联报纸上占篇幅很多而最受关心的消息之一，就是中国人民轰轰烈烈进行的抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动。
    苏联人民不但为新中国政治上经济上的每一个成就而欢呼，而且也关心和喜爱中国的文化，为中苏文化的交流而努力。最近在莫斯科举行的中国艺术展览会，一个半月中，有二十万人参观。他们对于中华民族的悠久文化，对于中国现代艺术家所走的正确的现实主义的道路，深致赞誉。苏联国家艺术学院院长阿历山大·格拉西莫夫把这次中国艺展看作“中苏两个伟大国家友谊的进展”。十一月九日，在莫斯科举行的中国艺展座谈会上，科学院院士契哥达耶夫评论了中国艺展中的现代艺术部分。他称道董希文的“生产自救”，吴作人的“李永像”，叶浅予的“假坟”。他说：赵域的“红旗”，彦涵的“不屈的人们”是从人民生活中来的，所以很感动人；戴泽的“和平签名”，因为内容好，使观者感动。至于木刻，他认为技术高超，明显地表现了人民的生活与斗争，如古元、李桦、彦涵的作品，是颇足引以为豪的。古元的“人桥”，尤为生动，这不是凭想像所能创造的。他预祝中国的雕刻和漫画有更多的作家和成就。苏联美术家就是这样像自己人一样地提供意见给我们美术家。
    不久以前，在苏联作家协会的一个茶话会上，作家协会的负责人谈到了出版中国作品的计划。国家文艺出版局正计划在一九五一年出版《三国志》和《水浒传》的第一卷，并准备出版更多的鲁迅作品。为了翻译得更好起见，拟采取作家与翻译家合作的办法，并已拟定了一个很长的名单。立陶宛作家说：赵树理的《李家庄的变迁》、丁玲的《太阳照在桑乾河上》，已译成立陶宛文出版了。
    从八月到十一月，苏联银幕上已放映了《中华女儿》、《光芒万丈》、《无形的战线》和《中国人民的胜利》等影片。现实地反映人民的生活和斗争、高度的思想性，是中国影片受苏联人民欢迎的原因。从十一月十二日起，中华杂技团在莫斯科表演了两星期。他们的绝妙的技巧受到了热烈的欢迎。
    在中华人民共和国成立一周年的时候，苏联广播电台第一次播送了大合唱《自由的中国》，由柯尔赤马列夫作曲，由诗人马杜索夫斯基作歌。这个歌分四部分，第一部分叙述中国的游击队，叙述中国人民解放军的生长：
    我们的队伍
      无比坚强地
      在战斗中壮大。
    人民追随着的他们，
      真理属于他们，
    只有勇敢的人们
      才会得到胜利。
    第二部分《万里长城》，以这来比喻中国的伟大和坚强：
    伟大的万里长城，
      遭遇过不少危险风暴，
      也经历了许多艰难；
    几世纪间都没有屈服，
      它坚持下来了。
    第三部分是中国青年一代之歌，歌颂他们建设新的自由的生活。最后一部分《中国青春》，歌颂着自由劳动的快乐。大合唱以胜利的歌词来结束：
    无畏地前进吧，
    朝着确定的方向！
      你的旗帜上的五颗星
      发着辉煌的胜利之光。
                                                     【新华社】
