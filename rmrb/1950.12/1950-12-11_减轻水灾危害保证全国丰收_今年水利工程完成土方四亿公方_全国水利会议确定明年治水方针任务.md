[Report from this newspaper] Thanks to the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people participating in water management, this year's national water conservancy work has achieved great results. This year, a total of over 419 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed nationwide, exceeding the original plan by nearly one time. Among them, flood control and drainage projects accounted for 96 percent of all projects. Most of the 42,000 kilometers of dikes of large and small rivers across the country were repaired, and important dangerous sections were strengthened, basically eliminating the state of disrepair and dilapidation of most river dikes due to years of neglect. In some areas that have suffered from floods for years, such as the Yihe and Muhe River basins in northern Jiangsu and the Chaobaihe River basin in Hebei Province, fundamental treatment projects have begun. In terms of irrigation projects, this year a total of more than 3 million mu of paddy fields were restored and increased nationwide, also exceeding the original plan. This ensured the successful completion of flood control tasks by most rivers this year, greatly reducing the damage of floods and ensuring a national harvest this year. However, due to the lack of thorough consideration and investigation and research, the formulation of engineering plans still had a certain degree of blindness and lacked clear and specific guidelines. At the same time, some engineering plans lacked comprehensive basin-wide plans. Moreover, there was a great deal of waste in the projects. Therefore, after listening to reports from various regions and summarizing this year's water conservancy work, the conference initially determined the guidelines and tasks for national water conservancy work in 1951, based on the current national situation and the existing conditions for water conservancy construction. The conference believes that as a result of the US imperialists expanding their war of aggression, consolidating national defense has become the country's primary task. To this end, the conference put forward several points that should be paid attention to in water conservancy construction next year:

First, it is necessary to focus on key points and practice strict economy. In the planning of water conservancy work, the whole country should have key points, and each region and each basin should select key points. Even each part of a project should be carefully considered for its needs, and priorities should be distinguished in order to use limited funds on projects that are most needed, most meaningful, and most effective. Resolutely overcome the shortcomings of blindness in the past that did not take into account the effectiveness and economic benefits of projects. It is necessary to consider the economic benefits of projects from many aspects and ensure that there is no waste.

Second, it is necessary to strengthen planning and design work and improve the project review system. The conference requires that water conservancy agencies at all levels, when formulating governance plans for various rivers, must first make a comprehensive plan for three, five, or even ten years, focusing on the characteristics of each river, and do a good job of preparation, and then grasp the key points while taking care of the overall situation, and carry out the work in stages in a systematic and step-by-step manner.

Third, strengthen organizational leadership in construction and stipulate uniform calculation principles for migrant workers' wages. It is necessary to accept the experience and lessons learned from past construction, do a good job in preparing before construction, supervising and inspecting during construction, as well as propaganda and education, and on-site hygiene.

Fourth, improve financial institutions and strengthen financial work. The financial work of water conservancy institutions should mainly ensure the supply of funds and food, fully cooperate with the needs of the project, and avoid losses and waste.

In addition, the conference conducted practical discussions on issues such as the leadership relationship, division of labor and cooperation, and staffing of water conservancy agencies at all levels, as well as the routine maintenance of dikes and the training, allocation, rewards, and punishments of cadres, and made specific regulations separately.

The conference was opened by Minister of Water Conservancy Fu Zuoyi and summarized by Deputy Minister Li Baohua.

    减轻水灾危害保证全国丰收
    今年水利工程完成土方四亿公方
    全国水利会议确定明年治水方针任务
    【本报讯】中央人民政府水利部自十一月二十三日在北京召开的一九五○年全国水利会议已于本月七日闭幕。出席会议的有全国各大行政区、各省、市和各河流域机关的水利专家、教授等共二百一十余人。今年全国的水利工作，由于参加治水的党、政、军、民的努力，获得了很大成绩。今年全国共完成土方达四亿一千九百余万公方，超过原计划几近一倍。其中防洪排水工程占全部工程的百分之九十六，培修了全国大小河流四万二千公里的大部堤防，加强了重要险工，基本上消除了多数河道堤防年久失修、残破不堪的状态。少数历年遭受洪水的地区，如苏北沂河和沐河流域、河北省潮白河流域，并已开始根治工程。在灌溉工程方面，今年全国共恢复和增加水田三百余万亩，也超过了原订计划。这就保证了今年多数河流胜利完成防汛任务，大大减轻了水灾的危害，保证了今年全国丰收。但由于缺乏周密的考虑和调查研究，在制订工程计划时还带有一定的盲目性，缺乏明确具体的方针。同时有些工程规划又缺乏流域性的全面的计划。而且工程浪费很大。因而会议在听取了各地报告和总结了今年水利工作之后，根据国家当前的情况和水利建设的现有条件，初步确定了一九五一年全国水利工作的方针和任务。会议认为：由于美帝扩大侵略战争的结果，巩固国防成为当前国家的首要任务。为此，会议提出了明年水利建设中应注意的几点：
    第一，要掌握重点，厉行节约。在水利工作的计划上，全国要有重点，各地区各流域都要选择重点，甚至一个工程的各个部分也要斟酌需要，分别轻重缓急，以求把有限的经费使用在需要最切、意义最重、功效最大的工程上。坚决克服以往不计算工程功效和经济效益的盲目性的缺点。要从多方面考虑工程的经济效益，切实做到不浪费。
    第二，要加强计划设计工作，改进计划审核制度。会议要求各级水利机构，凡制定各河流的治理计划，都须要针对各河特性，先作出一个三年五年乃至十年的通盘计划，做好准备工作，而后在照顾全面之中掌握重点，有系统有步骤地分期进行。
    第三，加强施工中的组织领导，规定民工工资的统一的计算原则。要接受过去施工中所获得的经验教训，作好施工前的准备、施工中的督促检查、以及宣传教育、工地卫生等工作。
    第四，健全财务机构，加强财务工作。水利机构中的财务工作，主要应保证财粮的供应，完全配合工程的需要，并避免损失和浪费。
    此外，关于各级水利机构的领导关系、分工配合及人员编制问题、以及平时的堤防修守养护工作和干部的培育计划、调配、奖惩等，会议均进行了切实的讨论，并分别作出具体的规定。
    会议由水利部傅作义部长致开幕词，由李葆华副部长作总结。
