    Transforming the District-Level All-Inclusive Leadership Method
    (Party Work Research)
    Former Huolu County Party Secretary Hou Yong
    Currently, a major deviation exists in the leadership methods of district-level cadres in some old liberated areas, which is the all-inclusive leadership method inherited from the Anti-Japanese War period. This leadership method usually involves forming district-level cadres into unified work teams to concentrate efforts on executing central tasks whenever a task arrives. This method played a significant role in the past during certain historical periods of concentrating forces to fight the enemy and opening up new areas; however, maintaining it in the current environment is very unsuitable. It has already formed the following serious deviations:

    First, a few people monopolize everything, violating the principles of collective leadership and the Party committee system. Usually, when a work task is assigned, only the district secretary and district head discuss it briefly, then convene a meeting of all district cadres to uniformly deploy it for execution. This way, all work, large and small, is taken on by a small number of comrades, limiting the enthusiasm and creativity of the cadres.

    Second, the Party substitutes for the government, disrupting the organizational system and weakening departmental work. Under the all-inclusive leadership method, each work team cadre becomes the district's plenipotentiary representative after arriving in the village, managing all kinds of work related to the Party, government, mass organizations, and armed forces. Most of the work team leaders are district committee members. If problems cannot be solved in the village, they are brought to the work team for resolution, thus forming a district-level administration at the village level. Very few cadres are left in the district-level organs, or only the district secretary is left alone. Thus, whether stationed in the organs or working in the countryside, Party and mass cadres take on administrative affairs, but some of the organization's own work is abandoned as a result. Some districts even leave only the district head behind when going to the countryside, and the district committee, Communist Youth League, etc., are locked up, so urgent instructions from higher authorities cannot be executed in a timely manner. Because cadres from various departments are continuously rushing to complete central tasks, they cannot properly carry out their own regular work, and even fail to convene departmental meetings for a long time, leaving lower-level organizations unattended for a long time, resulting in their disintegration.

    Third, the "solo fight" style of executing work means doing one job at a time, completing one and handing it over. This approach causes many regular tasks to become rush jobs due to long accumulation. Moreover, some regular work is delayed, especially branch construction, women's work, etc.

    Finally, administrative orders are prominently displayed. Every cadre becomes a village head after arriving in the village, using administrative power to promote the completion of work. They usually neglect mass work and cannot cultivate backbones well during movements. At the same time, it makes lower-level cadres trust individuals rather than the organization, so some villages can only solve problems when the district secretary or district head goes there.

    In short, all-inclusive leadership turns the Party into a daily administrative agency, violating the correct principle of the Party leading other organizations. The result of this leadership method can only be that some branches and the Communist Youth League lose their core and backbone role due to neglecting regular education and organizational work, causing losses in work. To transform the all-inclusive leadership method, it is necessary to first solve several ideological problems.

    Some district-level leading comrades worry that after changing the all-inclusive leadership, no one will do the central work. Of course, after transforming the all-inclusive leadership, the central work will be carried out by mobilizing the masses through the organizational systems of various departments under the leadership of the Party. On the surface, it seems that cadres from the Youth League, women's federation, and armed forces departments will no longer go through the village government to implement the central work, but in reality, all people's organizations will carry out the central work through their own organizational systems. For example, in production work, the Party leads and promotes the masses through the exemplary role of branches and Party members, the Communist Youth League unites the youth masses through League members, and the militia protects production. This way, mobilizing the masses through various organizational systems and forming a mass movement with leadership, each task can not only complete the task but also strengthen and consolidate the organizations of the Party and mass organizations through the mass movement, and drive the completion of several tasks through the central work, combining the central work with departmental work. In this way, there are more people doing the central work, which is much stronger than one cadre sitting and urging.

    Some comrades believe that after changing the all-inclusive leadership, departments will become independent and cadres will act freely. In fact, the all-inclusive leadership method has canceled most of the daily work of various departments, and various organizations are gradually disintegrating and weakening. It should be known that establishing and improving the regular work of various departments and developing and consolidating the organizations of various systems must be done in large mass movements (central work). Doing one's own thing in isolation from the central work is what independence means, which is a mistake of the departmental work itself and should be opposed; however, completing the central task through the system of one's own department is giving play to the unique role of various departments and should be affirmed.

    In the past, forming work teams to manage cadres going to the countryside had certain benefits for the daily ideological education and study of cadres. After transforming the all-inclusive leadership method, the number of cadres in each department is small, and the method of fixing villages must be abolished, so the control of cadres in the future mainly relies on strengthening ideological education to promote the cadres' consciousness and strengthen organization and discipline. The past method of managing cadres only by forming groups should be corrected.

    Some leading comrades worry that the all-inclusive leadership method has become a habit, and changing it will affect work. Naturally, changing a habit is not easy, but objectively we must change it, and it can be changed. Taking Hebei Province as an example, a district has thirty to fifty villages and forty thousand to seventy thousand people, and the number of district cadres, even if all are present, is only over twenty. If forces are divided, the work will suffer serious losses. Establishing a new leadership method is a process of arduous struggle, and we should consciously learn from lessons and experiences to accelerate this transformation process.

    Some comrades also believe that the district-level departments do not have many cadres (such as the Communist Youth League with only three people, the women's federation with only one person), and it is impossible to establish departmental work and carry out central work through the organizational system. This view is incorrect. Although there are very few cadres at the district level who are detached from production, it also has members who are not detached from production. Only through the committees of various systems can we better exert their organizational strength and mobilize a broader mass force to carry out work.

    After resolving various ideological resistances to the transformation of the all-inclusive leadership method, there must also be a set of working methods adapted to the transformation. Based on our experience, we feel that we must focus on the following aspects:

    (1) The all-inclusive leadership method must be transformed from top to bottom, especially the county and special district levels establishing scientific leadership methods to better change district-level leadership. At the same time, it is also important for county-level leading organs to put some effort into typical experiments to help district levels learn the working methods of separating Party and government.

    (2) Establish a sound Party committee system, regularly convene Party committee meetings to discuss the implementation of policies, central work, and departmental execution, strengthen collective leadership to overcome individual monopoly, and make the Party committee truly become the core of work, grasping the overall work. District committees should prepare well and fully deliberate when holding meetings, and regularly discuss the work of various departments, especially strengthening the leadership of Party affairs work, so that the work of the entire district can be divided and cooperated under unified leadership. This is the key issue in changing the all-inclusive leadership.

    (3) Establish departmental work, and the Party committee must not monopolize the work of government and people's organizations. In non-Party organizations, the Party committee should implement the Party's policies through the Party group. When conveying and deploying work downwards, in general, do not convene expanded cadre meetings, and should deploy them separately according to the system. For example, when deploying autumn tax collection work, the district government committee should first discuss it, and then convene a people's representative conference to discuss and implement it among the masses. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the district representative conference, the Party committee should convey it to the village branches, mobilize Party members to conscientiously implement policies, play an exemplary role, and unite the masses to complete the collection. The Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation should mobilize the youth and women to implement the resolutions of the representative conference.

    (4) Strengthen the district people's representative conference and the representative conferences of various mass organizations. Various representative conferences, especially the people's representative conference, are the best forms for the Party and government to connect with the masses and follow the mass line, and should be universally established and formed into a system. All policy issues, mass issues, or major tasks should be discussed by the representative conference to implement various measures of the Party and government among the masses and implement them. Mass organizations should also regularly convene representative conferences to fully promote democracy. This is the most important leadership method to overcome the separation of Party and government.

    (5) Establish assistant personnel and staff who are not detached from production, and strengthen their education so that they can take on certain tasks. This can both train cadres and promote the progress of overall work in the case of fewer cadres.

    (6) When cadres from various departments go to the countryside, they should determine a key village according to the needs of their department's work and central work, deeply work to gain experience, and then cooperate with cadres who are not detached from production to inspect and promote the work of nearby village organizations.

    (7) Strengthen the work of the organs, the district committee and the district office should retain a certain number of people in the organs to contact cadres going to the countryside, quickly convey instructions from higher authorities, and concentrate major problems to subordinate organs for resolution. Comrades staying in the organs can take care of checking the work of surrounding villages, and contact the county and villages to organize the exchange of experience.

    Finally, to overcome all-inclusive leadership, it is also necessary to strengthen the connection between various departments, exchange work information, cooperate in carrying out certain tasks, and solve problems in certain villages, etc., to prevent the phenomenon of each going its own way and not contacting each other.

### 转变区级一揽子领导方法（党的工作研究）

    转变区级一揽子领导方法
    （党的工作研究）
    前获鹿县委书记  侯永
    目前若干老解放区的区级干部的领导方法，存在着一个主要偏向，这就是从抗日时期沿袭下来的一揽子的领导方法。这种领导方法，通常是在任务到来后，把区级干部统一编成工作组，集中力量去执行中心工作。这种方法在过去集中力量对敌斗争、开辟新区的一定历史时期，曾起了很大作用；但是保持到现在的环境，则很不适合了。它已形成了以下几个严重的偏向：
    首先是少数人包办，违反了集体领导和党委制的原则。通常一个工作任务布置下来，只由区书、区长商量一番，便召集全区干部会议，统一布置一下就执行了。这样，把大大小小工作全部揽在少数同志身上，限制了干部的积极性和创造性。
    其次，以党代政，混乱了组织系统，削弱了部门工作。在一揽子领导方法下，每个工作组干部到村后，便成了区的全权代表，党、政、群、武各种工作都管。工作组长大部由区委委员担任。村里解决不了问题就拿到工作组去解决，这样小区便形成了一级。区级留在机关的干部很少，或单留区书一人。这样无论驻机关或下乡的党、群干部，就包揽了行政事务，但是若干本组织的业务则因此而放弃。甚至有的区下乡时只留区长一人，区委会、青年团等都把门子锁上，因此上级紧急的指示，也得不到及时执行。各部门的干部，由于接连着去突击中心任务，便不能很好地进行其本身的经常工作，甚至长期不召开部门会议，下层组织长期无人过问，而遭致涣散。
    再次，执行工作的“单打一”作风，来了一个工作做一个工作，做完一个交代一个。这样作法，使许多经常工作，因为积累太久，也变成了突击的工作。而且有些经常工作却被耽置起来了，特别是支部建设、妇女工作等。
    最后，突出地表现了行政命令。每个干部到村里都成了大村长，采用行政力量去推动完成工作。平时忽视群众工作，不能很好地在运动中培养骨干。同时，又使得下级干部相信个人不相信组织，所以一部分村庄只有区书，区长去了才能解决问题。
    总之，一揽子领导，使党变为一个日常事务机关，违背了党领导其他组织的正确原则。这种领导方法的结果，只能使某些支部与青年团由于忽视经常的教育和组织工作，而丧失其核心、骨干作用，使工作招致了损失。转变一揽子领导方法，必须首先解决若干思想问题。
    有的区级领导同志，顾虑着改变一揽子领导后，就没人做中心工作了。当然，在转变了一揽子领导后，中心工作将在党的领导下，通过各部门的组织系统去发动群众进行，表面上看来，青年、妇女、武装各部门干部不再去经过村政权执行中心工作，但实际上，各人民团体将都通过自己的组织系统去进行中心工作。例如，生产工作，党通过支部领导、党员的模范作用去带动群众，青年团则经过团员团结青年群众去进行，民兵则保卫生产。这样通过各组织系统发动群众，有领导地形成群众运动，每一个工作不但可以完成任务，并且可以通过群众运动健全和巩固党的以及群众团体的组织，通过中心工作去带动完成若干工作，使中心工作与部门工作结合起来。这样，做中心工作的人反倒多起来，比起一个干部坐催，力量要大得多。
    有的同志认为，改变了一揽子领导后，部门会闹独立性，干部会自由行动起来。事实上，一揽子的领导方法，把各部门的日常工作大部都取消了，各组织也逐渐涣散和削弱了。应该知道，树立和健全各部门的经常工作，发展和巩固各系统的组织，必须在大的群众运动（中心工作）中进行才能作到。离开中心工作孤立地搞一套才是闹独立性，这意味着部门工作本身的错误，是应当反对的；但，通过本部门的系统去完成中心任务，却是发挥各部门的独特作用，应当肯定的。
    过去编成工作组来管理下乡干部，对干部日常的思想教育与学习是有一定好处的。转变一揽子领导方法后，每个部门的干部数量少，固定村庄的办法又要取消，所以今后对干部的掌握主要依靠加强思想教育，以发扬干部的自觉性和加强组织性、纪律性。过去那种只靠编组的办法来管理干部是应当改正的。
    有些领导同志担心一揽子领导方法已经养成习惯，转变后会影响工作。自然，一个习惯的改变确是不容易的，但是，客观上要求我们必须改变，而且是可以改变的。就拿河北省来说，一个区有三十到五十个村，四万到七万人口，区干部人数全的也不过二十余人。如果分兵把口，工作定会遭受严重损失。一个新的领导方法的树立，是要经过一段艰苦斗争的过程的，我们应当自觉地吸取教训经验，以加速这一转变过程。
    还有的同志认为区级各部门的干部都不多（如青年团仅三人，妇联仅一人），建立部门工作，通过组织系统进行中心工作是不可能的。这种观点是不正确的。因为区级各部门脱离生产干部虽很少，但它还有不脱离生产的委员，只有通过各系统的委员会，才能更好的发挥其组织力量，动员更广泛的群众力量进行工作。
    对一揽子领导方法转变的各种思想抵触解决后，还必须有一套适应转变的工作方法。根据我们经验，觉得必须抓紧以下几方面来进行。
    （一）一揽子领导方法必须自上而下地转变，尤其是县与专区两级树立起科学的领导方法，才能很好地改变区级领导。同时县级领导机关拿出一些力量进行典型试验，帮助区级学会党政分开的工作方法，也是很重要的。
    （二）树立健全的党委制度，定期召开党委会讨论政策的贯彻，中心工作及部门的执行，加强集体领导克服个人包办，使党委会真正成为工作的核心，掌握全面工作。区委开会时应很好准备与充分酝酿，对各部门工作应定期讨论，特别是加强党务工作的领导，使全区工作在统一领导下分工合作。这是改变一揽子领导的关键问题。
    （三）树立部门工作，党委不得包办政权和人民团体的工作。在非党的组织中党委应经过党组实现党的政策。向下传达布置工作时，一般情况不要召开扩大的干部会，应分头按系统进行布置。例如布置秋征工作，首先应由区政府委员会讨论，再召开人民代表会讨论贯彻到群众中去。党委除加强区代表会的领导外，应向村支部传达，动员党员认真执行政策，起模范作用，团结群众完成征收。青年团、妇联，则发动青年、妇女执行代表会决议。
    （四）加强区人民代表会与各群众团体的代表会。各种代表会，特别是人民代表会，是党和政府联系群众走群众路线的最好形式，应该普遍建立起来并形成制度。凡有关政策问题、群众性问题或重大任务，均应该经代表会讨论，使党和政府的各种措施贯彻到群众中去，而付诸实施。群众组织亦应定期召开代表会，充分发扬民主。这是克服党政不分后最重要的领导方法。
    （五）建立不脱离生产的协助员、干事，并加强其教育，使能担负一定的工作。这样既可培养干部，又可在干部少的情况下，推动全面工作的进行。
    （六）各部门干部下乡时，应根据本部门工作和中心工作的需要，确定一个重点村，深入工作取得经验，再配合不脱离生产的干部检查和推动附近一片村组织的工作。
    （七）加强机关工作，区委会、区公所要留一定人员在机关，以联系下乡干部，迅速传达上级指示，把大问题集中到隶属机关解决。留机关的同志可以照顾检查周围村庄的工作，并与县、村联系，组织交流经验。
    最后，克服一揽子领导，还要加强各部门之间的联系，互相交换工作情况，配合执行一定任务，解决一定村庄的问题等，以防止各自为政、互不联系的现象发生。
