    Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Congratulatory Letter to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    [Our Newspaper] The Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce sent the following letter to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    To all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    First of all, allow us to express our greetings to you who are fighting valiantly on the front lines to defend our motherland, safeguard world peace, and struggle to the death against American imperialism. We hope to use your guns and cannons to tell the American imperialists that the industrialists and businessmen of Tianjin today are using unparalleled hatred and loathing to warn them to get out of Korea immediately.

    We Chinese industrialists and businessmen, including those in Tianjin, have suffered from imperialist aggression and exploitation for over a hundred years. Especially during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, as a result of American economic aggression, our national industrialists and businessmen were almost suffocated. The American imperialists' sinful actions have caused us countless suffering.

    Today, in the new China after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Chinese industry and commerce have finally broken free from the shackles of the three enemies: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and have embarked on the road of recovery and development. American imperialism is once again following the old path of Japanese imperialism, attempting to use the invasion of Korea as a starting point to attack our China and the entire Asia. We resolutely oppose this barbaric and shameless act of aggression and sabotage. We support Premier Zhou's statement that we cannot stand idly by, we support the declarations issued by various democratic parties, and we even more resolutely support the righteous actions of our Volunteer Army to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and the righteous war waged by the peace fighters of Korea to defend their motherland and safeguard world peace.

    On November 14th, our Tianjin industrial and commercial circles passed four specific tasks in the current movement to resist America and aid Korea:

    1.  Contribute all our strength to support the volunteer actions to resist America and aid Korea;
    2.  Hold fast to our work posts, ensure active management, and do a good job in production;
    3.  Resolutely support the government's policies and laws, ensure stable prices, and oppose hoarding, speculation, and profiteering;
    4.  Strengthen current affairs study, recognize the current situation, expand propaganda, unify thinking, recognize friends and enemies, and do not listen to rumors spread by reactionaries.

    On November 30th, which is today, we are once again demonstrating our unparalleled strength in opposing aggression and loving peace to American imperialism with a parade of 40,000 people, telling them that the Chinese people have long recognized their aggressive nature, and telling them that the Chinese people are the most peace-loving people, but when enemies invade and sabotage them, they are not afraid of war.

    Comrades! You are killing enemies on the front lines, and we are actively producing. The Chinese people have united into a whole with the peace-loving people of the world, and we will contribute all our strength to support you. We wish you good health and an early victory.

    With respect,
          Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
          November 30th

    天津工商业联合会
    致朝鲜人民军  中国人民志愿部队慰问信
    【本报讯】天津市工商业联合会致朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的信如下：
    朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿部队全体指战员同志们：
    首先让我们问候你们为保卫祖国、维护世界和平和美帝国主义做殊死斗争的火线上的辛劳，并希望借着你们的枪炮告诉美帝今天天津市的工商业者正以无比的仇视和憎恨，警告他们赶快退出朝鲜。
    我们中国的工商业者，包括天津市的工商业者在内，百余年来遭受着帝国主义的侵略和压榨，特别是解放前国民党反动派统治时期，美帝经济侵略的结果，我民族工商业者更是几至窒息，美帝的罪恶行为使我们遭受的痛苦是数不清的。
    今天处在解放后的新中国，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，中国的工商业好容易摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三个敌人的束缚，走上了恢复与发展的道路，美国帝国主义又踏着日本帝国主义的老路，企图以侵略朝鲜为开始，进攻我们中国和整个亚洲，我们坚决反对这种野蛮无耻的侵略和破坏行为，我们拥护周总理不能置之不理的声明，我们拥护各民主党派发表的宣言，我们更坚决的支持我志愿部队抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动，和朝鲜的和平斗士们为保卫祖国维护世界和平所进行的正义战争。
    十一月十四日我们天津市工商业界通过了在当前抗美援朝运动中的四项具体任务：
    一、贡献一切力量，支援抗美援朝的志愿行动；
    二、坚守工作岗位，保证积极经营，搞好生产；
    三、坚决支持政府政策法令，保证稳定物价，反对囤积居奇、投机倒把；
    四、加强时事学习，认清目前形势，扩大宣传；统一思想，认清敌友，不听反动分子造谣。
    十一月三十日也就是今天，我们又以四万人的游行，向美帝国主义显示我们反对侵略和爱好和平的无比力量，告诉他们中国人民早已认清了他们的侵略本质，告诉他们中国人民是最喜好和平的人民，但当敌人向他进行侵略和破坏的时候，却也不怕战争。
    同志们！你们在火线上杀敌，我们在积极地生产，中国人民已和世界上爱好和平的人民团结成了一个整体，我们会贡献一切力量来支援你们。祝你们健康和早日胜利。此致
    敬礼        天津市工商业联合会
          十一月三十日
