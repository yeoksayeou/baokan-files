Generally speaking, the history of the Korean people's revolutionary struggle has similarities to that of the Chinese people, namely, it is basically a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, the reality reflected in the Korean film "My Hometown" is not unfamiliar, irrelevant, or alienating, but rather intimate, closely connected, and deeply felt.

Taking Guan Bi and his family as representatives, the Korean people, under the severe oppression and cruel exploitation of Japanese imperialism and feudal landlords, carried out a struggle to liberate themselves. As the film depicts, the Korean people finally won victory, established a people's democratic government in North Korea, and shattered the rule of Japanese imperialism and feudal landlords. Afterwards, we know that in the years 1945-50, land reform was completed and economic and cultural construction began.

But today, we see that the American imperialists, who have replaced Japanese imperialism in invading Asia, and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, are baring their bloody claws to the Korean people, plundering the fruits of revolutionary struggle, and seriously threatening the safety of the Chinese people. Whether in Korea or China, the fruits of revolutionary struggle must not be plundered by American imperialism. Defending the fruits of revolutionary struggle, defending the victory of the people, striving for world peace, and resisting American imperialist aggression are not only the affairs of the Korean people, but also the affairs of us Chinese people. We understand that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, and the Korean people are the closest brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people. We absolutely need to support Korea and help the Korean people to quickly wipe out the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit army!

    《我的故乡》
    一般的说来，朝鲜人民的革命斗争历史具有与中国人民的革命斗争相似的地方，即，在基本上，同样的是反帝国主义、反封建主义的革命斗争。因此，朝鲜影片《我的故乡》所反映的现实生活，不仅不是陌生的、无关的、隔阂的，反而是亲切的、骨肉相连的、感如身受的。
    以官弼及其家中人为代表的朝鲜人民，在日本帝国主义与封建地主的严重压迫与残酷剥削下，进行了解放自己的斗争。如影片所写，朝鲜人民终于获得了胜利，在北朝鲜建立了人民民主政权，粉碎了日本帝国主义与封建地主的统治。此后，我们知道，在一九四五——五○年中，又曾完成了土地改革，开始了经济的与文化的建设。
    但今天，我们看见了：代替了日本帝国主义进行侵略亚洲的美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮正向朝鲜人民张开血腥的魔爪，掠夺革命斗争的果实，并严重威胁着中国人民的安全。无论是在朝鲜还是在中国，革命斗争的果实都不容美帝国主义掠夺。保卫革命斗争的果实，保卫人民的胜利，争取世界和平，反抗美帝侵略，这不仅是朝鲜人民的事情，也是我们中国人民的事情。我们明白：美帝国主义是中国人民与朝鲜人民共同的敌人，朝鲜人民是中国人民的最亲近的弟兄与战友，我们完全有必要支援朝鲜，帮助朝鲜人民迅速的把美国侵略者和李承晚的匪军消灭干净！
