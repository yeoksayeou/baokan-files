    Jiaocheng County Government Disregards Forest Protection Work; Repeated Incidents of Forest Fires
    To the Editor:
    The Jiaocheng County government in Shanxi Province is neglecting forest protection, resulting in three consecutive forest fires in less than a month, destroying a total of 1,260 mu of mountain forests and barren slopes. The details of these incidents are as follows:
    On November 14th, a fire broke out in the barren mountains of Tashang, Dongxiliangdi, and Shangwaxun in the Fourth District of Jiaocheng County, burning over 1,000 mu. The fire extinguished itself after heavy snowfall. The cause of the fire was reportedly due to the flames spreading from the Beishan mountain in the San Dao Chuan Zhai Zi Gou area of Fenyang County.
    On November 21st at 2:00 AM, another mountain fire broke out in the Dachao Ping Gou area of the Fourth District, burning for about three hours. Fortunately, Li Hushan of the Dachao Ping forest protection team discovered it and reported it to his superiors. Miao, the deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau's Third Branch, immediately led more than 20 people and mobilized over a hundred villagers from neighboring villages to rush to the fire and extinguish it. An investigation revealed that a total of 200 mu of mountain forest had been burned. Due to the density of the forest, the damage to the trees is still being assessed.
    In early December, Sun Dailin and three others from Shuangjiazhai Village in the Fourth District went up the mountain to collect firewood and started a fire to keep warm, which caused a mountain fire. Fortunately, Comrade Gong Yulin from the Jiaocheng Forestry Office happened to pass by and discovered it, mobilizing the masses to put out the fire. An inspection revealed that over 60 mu of mountain forest had been burned.
    The main reason for these three forest fires is that the leading organs of Jiaocheng County do not pay enough attention to forest protection work. The county government's instructions to prohibit burning slopes and strengthen forest protection were not issued until November 21st, by which time the second forest fire had already occurred. Of course, the district government should also bear considerable responsibility. The county's enlarged cadre meeting in early December made arrangements for forest protection work, but the district government did not effectively publicize the instructions to the masses and did not turn forest protection work into mass work, resulting in further losses to the people's property. I believe that the Jiaocheng County government should conduct a thorough self-criticism of this issue in order to improve forest protection work.

### 交城县府不重视护林工作  连续发生烧毁山林事件

    交城县府不重视护林工作
    连续发生烧毁山林事件编辑同志：
    山西交城县政府，疏于保护山林，以致不到一月时间，竟连续发生三次烧山事件，共毁山林荒坡一千二百六十亩。几次事件发生经过如下：
    十一月十四日，交城四区塔上、东西梁底、上娃洵等处荒山起火，共烧一千余亩，后来下雪大火自灭。起火的原因，据说是从汾阳县三道川寨子沟北山延烧过来的。
    十一月二十一日二时，四区大草坪沟又起山火，燃烧约三小时之久，幸被大草坪护林小组李虎山发现，并报告上级，立即有山西省林业三分局苗副局长带领二十余人，发动邻村群众百余人，奔起火处将火扑灭。事后调查，共烧毁山林二百亩。损毁林木，因森林稠密，尚无法统计。
    本月上旬，四区双家寨村孙代林等四人上山砍柴，烤火取暖，引起山火。幸有交城林业办事处宫玉林同志路过发现，才动员群众将火扑灭，经检查共烧毁山林六十余亩。
    这三起烧山事件发生的主要原因，是交城县领导机关对护林工作重视不够，县府禁止烧坡点山加强护林工作的指示到十一月二十一日才发出来，但当时已发生了第二起烧山事件。当然，区政府也应负相当责任，十二月上旬县的扩大干部会议上对于护林工作曾作了布置，但区政府没有把指示精神很好地向群众宣传，没把保护山林工作变成群众工作，遂使人民财产再次遭受损失。我认为交城县府对此应作深刻检讨，以改进护林工作。
