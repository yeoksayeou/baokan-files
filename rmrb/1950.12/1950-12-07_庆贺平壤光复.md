    Celebrating the Liberation of Pyongyang
    The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, after defeating MacArthur's "general offensive," liberated Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the 6th of this month. Now, the valiant people's army is pursuing and annihilating the routed enemy, continuing to expand its victories. The Chinese people, driven by righteous indignation, have achieved a significant and glorious victory in their voluntary and just action to assist the Korean people in resisting American aggression.
    When the American aggressors were driven to Daegu and Busan by the Korean People's Army in July of this year, they became enraged and arrogantly organized the Incheon landing, attempting to salvage the failure of their invasion plan. At that time, they did not hesitate to intensify their war of aggression against Korea, provoking China. In four months, the American imperialist air force invaded our Northeast airspace a total of 200 times. Completely disregarding our people's repeated solemn warnings and disrespecting the sacred territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, they brazenly and recklessly advanced towards the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, bordering China and Korea. Our people could no longer tolerate this and launched a vigorous movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. We stepped forward and formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight alongside the Korean People's Army. From then on, the situation in the Korean War changed.
    The Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteer Army achieved their first victory in the Unsan-Onjong area in early November, dealing a severe blow to the American aggressors. However, the American aggressors remained unrepentant and continued to launch their so-called "general offensive to end the Korean War." Our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army then launched a second large-scale counteroffensive on November 25th, quickly crushing MacArthur's 200,000-strong army's general offensive, recovering more than ten towns, and in one fell swoop, marched south, causing the red flag, symbolizing happiness and hope, to fly again on Moran Hill. This great victory is a strong manifestation of the will and strength of the Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in assisting the Korean people in resisting American imperialist aggression has given the people of Asia and the world a most powerful encouragement in their struggle for peace, and has unprecedentedly increased the confidence of the people of the world in resisting imperialist aggression and enslavement. The sinister schemes of the imperialist warmongers to instigate and expand the war of aggression have suffered a major setback. Facts have shown that the appearance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and its great victory have changed the history of the world, crushed the aggressive arrogance of the imperialist devils, and further intensified the quarrels and divisions within the imperialist aggressive camp. This has made an extremely important contribution to the cause of world peace.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in assisting the Korean people in resisting American imperialist aggression shows that although the imperialist aggressors maintain an advantage in naval and air forces in certain areas and boast of their superior technology and firepower, they can still be defeated, and the power of the people cannot be defeated. Obviously, the Chinese and Korean people's armed forces have no strong air support or naval cover, and rely entirely on light weapons and foot soldiers. In the snowy mountains and fields of North Korea, our heroes, under correct command, rely on a fiery heart, hate the enemy, despise the enemy, scorn the enemy, and advance bravely, constantly achieving victories. This fully demonstrates that the people's war is a just war, and the people's power is invincible; and that the American aggressor is a paper tiger. The fear of America is unfounded. As long as the people of all Asia and the world unite as one and constantly inflict heavy blows on the enemy, we will achieve greater victories.
    The appearance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, especially after the victories in the continuous counteroffensives, has thrown the accomplices of the American imperialists, such as the British and French imperialists, into unprecedented panic. They are already blaming each other and attacking each other. Countries such as Britain and France are already dissatisfied with MacArthur's "overstepping of authority" and are demanding his replacement; they have also proposed that Britain and France share command in the "joint unified command" of the invading forces. This further illustrates that the superficial unity of the imperialist group in interfering in Korea cannot last. Today, the American imperialists' dream of a quick victory has been completely shattered, and the future of the war is already very bleak for them. Those in the imperialist camp with any foresight will regret that they should not have been pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the American imperialists.
    However, the American imperialists will not learn their lesson. Acheson's "strategy of freedom" speech and Truman's statement "on the Korean situation" show, on the one hand, the sadness and anxiety of the imperialists over the failure of their war of aggression, but on the other hand, they also reveal their determination to further expand the war of aggression and to be enemies of the people to the end. The day after Truman issued his statement, he submitted a request to the US Congress for an additional $18 billion in military budget for the current year, and Marshall further stated that the United States would conduct "partial mobilization." It can be predicted that the outcome of the talks between Attlee and Truman, whether in the East or West, will definitely continue to strengthen the war preparations and deployments of the imperialist group in order to further expand the aggression. The people of the world will make a mistake if they are not vigilant about this.
    We Chinese people are absolutely unwilling to have war, but hope for peace. Therefore, we have consistently adhered to and repeatedly proposed the idea of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. However, the American imperialists have not only rejected all reasonable proposals for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, but are still intensifying their calls and actions to expand the war. Therefore, our people must continue to struggle, strive to build a strong national defense force, more rapidly strengthen our air force, navy, and army, more vigorously strengthen our national defense economic construction, and continue to develop and deepen the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, in order to completely defeat the enemy's provocations and aggression.
    The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, continue to advance and advance again on the road to victory! If the enemy's aggression does not stop, then the attacks on the enemy must never stop!

    庆贺平壤光复
    英雄的朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军继击溃麦克阿瑟的“总攻势”后，于本月六日光复了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤。现在，神勇的人民军队，正在追歼溃敌，继续扩大战果。中国人民激于义愤，志愿援助朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的正义行动，已经获得了重大的辉煌胜利。
    美国侵略者在今年七月间被朝鲜人民军打到大邱、釜山之后，老羞成怒，狂妄地组织了仁川登陆，企图挽救它侵略计划的失败，并且不惜在当时就加紧扩大其侵朝战争，向中国挑衅。四个月中，美帝侵朝空军，侵入我东北领空，前后共达二百次之多。它完全漠视我国人民不断的严正警告，不尊重我中华人民共和国神圣的领土主权，竟肆无忌惮地向中朝接境的鸭绿江边与图们江边疯狂进犯。我国人民忍无可忍，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，并挺身而出，组成了中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。从此就改变了朝鲜战争的形势。
    朝鲜人民军与我人民志愿军于十一月初在云山温井地区取得了首次的胜利，给了美国侵略者以严重打击，但是，美国侵略者仍无悔祸之心，继续发动了所谓“结束朝鲜战争的总攻势”。我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军乃于十一月二十五日开始举行了第二次大规模的反攻，迅速地打垮了麦克阿瑟二十万军队的总攻势，收复城镇十余处，并一鼓作气，挥军南指，使象征着幸福与希望的红旗，重新飘扬在牡丹台上。这个伟大的胜利，是我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的意志与力量的坚强表现。
    中国人民志愿军支援朝鲜人民抵抗美帝侵略的胜利，使亚洲和全世界人民争取和平的斗争，得到了一次最有力的鼓励，使全世界人民反抗帝国主义侵略与奴役的胜利信心，空前地提高起来了。帝国主义战争贩子们挑动与扩大侵略战争的罪恶阴谋，遭受了重大的挫折。事实说明，中国人民志愿军的出现及其伟大胜利，改变了世界的历史，打垮了帝国主义凶神恶煞的侵略气焰，并且使帝国主义侵略阵营内部的争吵与分化更加剧烈了。这对于全世界人民保卫和平的事业，具有极重要的贡献。
    中国人民志愿军支援朝鲜人民抵抗美帝侵略的胜利表明：尽管帝国主义侵略者在局部地区保有海空军的优势，并自夸其技术与火力的高强，它仍然是可以被击败的，而人民的力量，则是不可被战胜的。显然，中朝人民武装，既无强大空军支援，也无海军掩护，而全以轻武器徒步作战。在北朝鲜冰雪山野，我们的英雄们在正确的指挥之下，凭着一颗火热的心，仇视敌人，鄙视敌人，蔑视敌人，勇往直前，就不断取得了胜利。这充分说明了人民的战争是正义的战争，人民的力量是无敌的；而美国侵略者则是一只纸老虎。恐美病是没有根据的。只要全亚洲和全世界的人民团结一致，不断给敌人以沉重的打击，我们就会获得更大的胜利。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜出现之后，特别是在连续反攻的胜利之后，使美帝的同谋犯英法等帝国主义者陷于空前的惊惶失措，他们已经在互相埋怨，彼此攻讦。英法等国已经不满于麦克阿瑟的“逾越职权”，要求予以撤换；它们还提出英法在侵略军的“联合统一司令部”中分享指挥权的要求。这更可以说明，帝国主义集团干涉朝鲜的表面一致，是不能持久的。今天，美帝国主义者速胜的梦想已经完全破灭了，战争的前途对于它们已经是十分暗淡的了。帝国主义阵营中稍有眼光的都将会悔恨它们自己不该为美帝国主义火中取栗。
    然而，美帝国主义者是不会学取教训的。艾奇逊的“自由战略”演说与杜鲁门的“关于朝鲜局势”的声明，一方面显示了帝国主义者对于侵略战争失败的悲哀与忧虑，但另一方面也表露了它们决心进一步扩大侵略战争，与人民为敌到底的决心。杜鲁门发表声明的次日，即已向美国国会提出追加本年度军事预算一百八十亿美元的要求，而马歇尔更表示要在美国进行“局部动员”。可以预料，艾德礼和杜鲁门的会谈结果，不管它在东方或西方，总一定要继续加强帝国主义集团的战争准备和部署，以便进一步扩大侵略。世界人民如果不警惕这一点，就会犯错误。
    我们中国人民是决不愿意战争，而是希望和平的。因此，我们一贯坚持并且屡次提出和平解决朝鲜问题的主张。但是，美国帝国主义者不但拒绝了和平解决朝鲜问题的一切合理建议，而且仍然在加紧它扩大战争的叫嚣与行动，因此，我国人民还必须继续奋斗，努力建设起坚强的国防力量，更迅速地壮大我们的空军、海军和陆军，更努力地加强我们的国防经济建设，继续开展和深入抗美援朝运动，以便完全打败敌人的挑衅和侵略。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在胜利的道路上，继续前进再前进呵！敌人的侵略不停止，对敌人的打击就决不要停止！
