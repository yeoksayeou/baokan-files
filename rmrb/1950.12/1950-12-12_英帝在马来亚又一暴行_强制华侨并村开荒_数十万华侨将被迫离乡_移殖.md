    Another Atrocity of the British Empire in Malaya
    Forcibly Merging Villages and Forcing Overseas Chinese to Reclaim Wasteland
    Hundreds of Thousands of Overseas Chinese to Be Forced to Leave Their Homes and "Resettle"
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] In addition to bloody atrocities such as expulsion, imprisonment, and killing against overseas Chinese in Malaya, the British colonial government in Malaya has recently been engaged in a large-scale and vicious policy of forcibly merging villages and forcing overseas Chinese to reclaim wasteland throughout Malaya. According to Singapore newspaper reports: The British colonial government of Perak has established a "new village" surrounded by barbed wire two miles west of the town of Tapah. More than 1,200 households, totaling more than 7,000 people, from rural Chinese residents in areas such as Gopeng, Pusing, Pudu, Tapah, and Pusing in the state will be forcibly "resettled" to the "new village" in December of this year. The British colonial government has established two police stations there to supervise them.

    In Yong Peng town, Johor, 590 Chinese households with a total of 2,809 people have been "resettled" in "Yong Peng New Village". The Yong Peng office of the reactionary "Malayan Chinese Association" investigated their situation after being forced to relocate, and published a report on November 2, revealing that 588 of them suffered significant losses and extreme hardship. The report divides them into the following four categories: "A. Those who have difficulty obtaining food and are homeless, 44 households. B. Proletarian laborers who barely manage to build houses due to large families, resulting in a tight life, 270 households. C. Poor people with no support and with elderly parents and young children, 108 households. D. Small landowners whose livelihoods have been disrupted by immigration, resulting in a difficult life, 166 households."

    The British colonial government of the Federation of Malaya has drafted a plan to "resettle" 300,000 to 400,000 Chinese villagers in rural Malaya "to areas that the police can control." The implementation of this plan is forcing a large number of our compatriots to leave their homes where they have lived for many years, lose their hard-earned shops, workshops, vegetable gardens, rice fields and rubber plantations, and go to concentration camps in disguise to starve and reclaim wasteland under the bayonets of the British military police.

    英帝在马来亚又一暴行
    强制华侨并村开荒         
    数十万华侨将被迫离乡“移殖”
    【新华社十一日讯】马来亚英国殖民政府对我国华侨除了采取驱逐、囚禁、杀戮等血腥暴行外，最近并在全马来亚从事大规模的强制华侨并村开荒的毒辣政策。据新加坡报纸消息：霹雳州英国殖民政府，已经在督亚冷镇西方二英里的双溪榴莲地区，建立一个四周用有刺铁丝网围绕的“新村”。该州甲板、布先、埔地、督亚冷、平顺等地区的乡村华侨居民一千二百多户，共七千多人，将于本年十二月间被强迫集体“移殖”到该“新村”。英国殖民政府在那儿设立两个警察署，监督他们。
    在柔佛州永平镇，华侨五百九十户共二千八百零九人，已被“移殖”到“永平新村”里。反动的“马华公会”的永平办事处调查他们被迫迁移后的情况，于十一月二日发表报告书，透露其中五百八十八户受到重大的损失和遭遇极大的困苦。该报告把他们分成如下四类：“甲、日食难度，无家可归者，四四户。乙、无产阶级劳工，因家口繁重，勉强架屋插足，以致生活拮据者，二七○户。丙、单丁无靠以及上老下幼的贫民，一○八户。丁、小园主受移民影响，生活来源停顿，以致生活困苦者，一六六户。”
    马来亚联合邦英殖民政府已拟订了一个计划，预定将马来亚乡村中为数三、四十万的华侨村民“移殖到警察能够控制的地区里。”这个计划的实行，正使我国大批侨胞被迫离开他们居住多年的住宅，丧失了他们辛苦经营的商店、作坊、菜圃、稻田与橡胶园，在英国军警的刺刀下，到变相的集中营中去挨饿开荒。
