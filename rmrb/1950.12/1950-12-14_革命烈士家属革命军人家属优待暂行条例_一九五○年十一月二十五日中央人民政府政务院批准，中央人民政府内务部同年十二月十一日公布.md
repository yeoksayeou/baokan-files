Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Revolutionary Military Personnel
Approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on November 25, 1950, and promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on December 11 of the same year.

Article 1 These regulations are formulated in accordance with the principle of Article 25 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Article 2 All personnel with military status in the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces, and their families, shall be entitled to the preferential treatment stipulated in these regulations.

Article 3 The term "family members of revolutionary military personnel" (hereinafter referred to as "military families") in these regulations refers to direct relatives, spouses, and siblings under the age of sixteen who live with the military personnel and depend on the military personnel for their livelihood, or other relatives who have relied on the military personnel for upbringing since childhood and now must rely on the military personnel for their livelihood.

Article 4 Military families must obtain military family qualifications based on the certification documents from the political organs above the regimental level of the revolutionary military personnel's unit. If the unit's certification cannot be obtained temporarily, it may be certified by the village people's representative meeting or the village people's government and approved by the county (city) people's government for temporary preferential treatment as a military family. If a female revolutionary military person's family (her parents' home or her husband's family) should obtain military family qualifications, the female military person shall decide, and it shall be noted on the certificate. If not noted, it shall be decided according to the habits of the masses.

Article 5 If a revolutionary military person sacrifices and has already obtained the qualification of a martyr, his or her family is called a "martyr's family" and may continue to enjoy the preferential treatment stipulated in these regulations, and under the same conditions, martyrs' families should be given priority.

Article 6 All martyr's families and military families shall enjoy the following preferential treatments:

	(1) In the land reform, when distributing land, farm tools, draught animals, and surplus grain and houses, appropriate care should be given to poor martyr's and military families, unless otherwise stipulated by the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China;
	(2) When allocating, renting, lending, or selling public land, houses, venues, and implements, martyr's and military families have the priority to obtain, lease, borrow, and purchase under the same conditions as the masses;
	(3) Children of poor martyrs and poor revolutionary military personnel have priority in enjoying public funding and scholarship treatment when entering school;
	(4) When state-owned enterprises, stores, cooperatives, organs, and schools employ staff, martyr's and military families should be given priority under the same conditions as the masses;
	(5) When cooperatives sell goods at low prices, martyr's and military families should be given priority under the same conditions as the masses;
	(6) When poor martyrs and poor military families go to public health organs for treatment, medical expenses should be reduced or exempted as appropriate with the introduction of the people's government above the district level;
	(7) When the government provides social relief or lends grain or loans, poor martyr's and military families have the priority to receive and borrow under the same conditions;
	(8) Respect and improve the social status of martyr's and military families, and give them spiritual comfort; such as congratulating them on meritorious service, hanging honorary plaques, visiting them on important festivals, and setting up seats for martyr's and military families at meetings, etc.

Article 7 The care for the lives of martyr's and military families is mainly based on organizing them to participate in production and establish family affairs. In rural areas, they should be organized as much as possible to participate in various agricultural and sideline production activities. For those with less land and lack of labor, substitute farming or other methods should be adopted to help them solve the difficulties in production, so that their land output is not lower than the harvest of ordinary local farmers. In cities, efforts should be made to help them find employment and organize them to engage in various handicrafts or other sideline production activities.

Article 8 For individual martyr's and military families who have extreme difficulties in life, in addition to the preferential treatment in the preceding two articles, the number of people who cannot support themselves may be given material subsidies according to the following provisions:

	(1) Those living in rural areas shall not exceed 15 catties of food grain per person per month;
	(2) Those living in cities shall not exceed 20 catties of food grain per person per month;
	(3) Those with military service of more than five years whose families have special difficulties in life may be given additional subsidies as appropriate, but shall not exceed one-quarter of the provisions in items 1 and 2 of this article;
	(4) For widowed, orphaned, and childless martyr's and military families who are helpless and have no production capacity, with the certification of the village people's representative meeting or the village people's government and reported to the people's government above the county (city) level for approval, additional subsidies shall be issued as appropriate, to the extent that they can maintain a life equivalent to that of the general public.

Article 9 The list of martyr's and military families enjoying the preferential treatment stipulated in the preceding article and the amount of grain must be reviewed by the district people's government and approved by the county (city) people's government to be included in the local grain expenditure reimbursement. The term "food grain" refers to the main food grain distributed in various places.

Article 10 When martyr's and military families move their residence, they must hold the certification documents from the people's government above the county (city) level of their original residence, and the people's government of the new residence county (city) shall give them the same treatment as local martyr's and military families.

Article 11 In addition to enjoying preferential treatment in accordance with these regulations, martyr's and military families have the same rights and obligations as the general public.

Article 12 If revolutionary military personnel desert or are expelled from the military, their families' military family qualifications should be revoked from the date of receiving the notice from the unit, and the military family certificate should be recovered and the preferential treatment stopped.

Article 13 If a martyr's or military family is deprived of civil rights for committing a crime, the preferential treatment that they should enjoy shall be stopped. If a military family transfers preferential treatment rights to others, it shall be invalid.

Article 14 Revolutionary staff members who enjoy the supply system and contract system, their families may enjoy the various preferential treatments stipulated in these regulations in accordance with the principle of being slightly lower than military families.

Article 15 These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
