Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 3rd: The Nanjing Municipal People's Court has concluded the trial regarding the case of the Kuomintang bandit "China Anti-Communist, Resist Russia, Save the Nation Association" counter-revolutionary organization's special agents robbing the residence of Mr. Abati, the former Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires to China, and wounding the former Chargé d'Affaires Abati. With the approval of the East China Military and Political Committee, the official verdict has been announced: Gao Xiachang, Li Shanxiu, and Zhang Mingliang, the masterminds, planners, and leaders of the bandit special agent organization, were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the morning of the 2nd. Accomplices Zhang Mingshan and Chen Xuerong, along with thirteen others involved in the robbery at the scene, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to fifteen years.

According to the confessions of the main culprits Gao Xiachang, Li Shanxiu, and Zhang Mingliang, the bandit "China Anti-Communist, Resist Russia, Save the Nation Association" special agent organization was formed in May of this year. In June and July of this year, the organization distributed reactionary leaflets in the Nanjing urban area and repeatedly engaged in extortion. They also established bandit special agent armed forces in northern Jiangsu to carry out activities. In mid-August, the bandit special agent organization held a meeting at the Xuanwu Lake Tea Pavilion in Nanjing, planning to rob the residence of the former Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires and assassinate the former Chargé d'Affaires Abati, and formally carried out the conspiracy on September 3rd. After the incident, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau immediately launched an investigation overnight and solved the case within three days, arresting the main culprits Gao Xiachang, Zhang Mingliang, and accomplice Zhang Mingshan, among others. At the time, the bandits attempted to use the private grudge between Zhang Mingshan and Abati as a smokescreen to cover up their counter-revolutionary political motives, but they could not escape the rigorous investigation of the People's Government Public Security Bureau. The entire case was solved on September 21st. Furthermore, the Criminal Police Brigade of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau demonstrated a responsible and meticulous approach in their investigation, enabling the rapid resolution of the case, fully demonstrating the spirit of our people's public security forces in resolutely consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and actively completing their tasks. The Municipal People's Government has issued a circular commending them.

    南京阿巴提案审讯结束
    匪首高遐昌等伏法
    公安人员迅速破案受到表扬
    【新华社南京三日电】南京市人民法院对于蒋匪“中国人民反共抗俄救国会”反革命组织的特务抢劫南京前埃及驻华大使馆代办阿巴提住宅，刺伤前代办阿巴提案，已经审讯结束，经华东军政委员会批准正式宣判：全案主谋、策划者、该匪特组织首脑高遐昌、李善修、张明亮三人判处死刑，已于二日晨执行枪决，从犯张铭山及现场抢劫犯陈学荣等十三人分别判处五年至十五年有期徒刑。
    据该案首犯高遐昌、李善修、张明亮自供，匪“中国人民反共抗俄救国会”特务组织，系于今年五月组成。该组织曾于今年六、七月间在南京市区散发反动传单，同时又屡次进行勒索，并在苏北建立匪特武装进行活动。八月中旬该匪特组织又在南京玄武湖茶亭集会，筹划抢劫前埃及代办住宅，谋刺前代办阿巴提，并于九月三日正式实行该项阴谋。事件发生后，南京市人民政府公安局当即连夜侦缉，在三日内即行破案，捕获主犯高遐昌、张明亮及从犯张铭山等。当时诸匪企图以张铭山与阿巴提主雇间的私人怀恨为烟幕，来掩饰其反革命政治面目，但逃不出人民政府公安局的严密侦察。九月二十一日该案即全部被破获。又，此次南京市人民政府公安局刑警大队，认真负责，严密侦缉，使该案迅速破案，乃充分表现了我人民公安武装坚决巩固人民民主专政、积极完成任务的精神，市人民政府已予以通令表扬。
