Comrade Representatives:

The main purpose of this Municipal People's Representative Conference is to discuss the current situation and the methods for electing representatives for the next conference. Therefore, I do not intend to report on the general work done by the Municipal People's Government in the past three months. Instead, I will briefly report on the progress of two important tasks specifically entrusted to the Municipal People's Government by the previous conference – namely, unemployment relief and the universal convening of district people's representative conferences. (In addition, there is a report by Director Luo of the Public Security Bureau on the suppression of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities over the past year.)

First, I will report on the unemployment relief work:

Since the liberation of Beijing, the unemployed population has been greatly reduced compared to before liberation, but the unemployment problem has not been completely solved. According to a survey in July of this year, there are still over 10,000 unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals. On this issue, Vice Chairman Liu Ren of the Municipal Consultative Committee gave a detailed report at the last representative conference and proposed specific relief plans, which were approved by the conference for full implementation. Over the past three months, the results of implementation have been preliminary achievements.

Originally, before the last representative conference was convened, we had already established an Unemployment Relief Committee on July 22, based on the State Council's "Instructions on Relief for Unemployed Workers" and "Interim Measures for Relief for Unemployed Workers." From July 24th, we began the work of registering unemployed workers by district. (This method of registering by district is conducive to the centralized handling of unemployed workers' contact, organization, and education, and is an experience to better complete the registration task.) As of the end of November, a total of 9,411 people had been registered. Among them, unemployed workers (including industrial workers, handicraft workers, shop assistants, and porters) accounted for about 70%, and unemployed intellectuals (including teachers, clerks, and some students above secondary school level) accounted for about 30%. If we exclude the 1,933 miners who were temporarily unemployed due to the rainy season flooding the kilns after the July survey, then there are only 7,478 people, which is about 73% of the originally surveyed number of unemployed people. Now the registration work is nearing completion, and there are not many people continuing to register. After the registration began, we immediately processed them according to the plan passed by the last Municipal Representative Conference, either helping them find employment. The progress is as follows:

(1) Employment – According to a survey in late November, 4,260 people have been employed, accounting for about 45% of the total number registered. Among them, 3,122 people have found permanent jobs, and 1,138 people have found temporary jobs. Excluding the miners who resumed work in Mentougou, according to incomplete statistics, more than 1,100 people have joined industrial and mining enterprises, more than 850 people have joined government agencies and schools, more than 490 people have joined commercial businesses, and more than 200 people have joined transportation enterprises.

The biggest problem in introducing employment is that many unemployed people cannot adapt to the new production requirements. On the one hand, many unemployed people cannot find work; on the other hand, many jobs need people but cannot find them. For example, mechanics and electricians are in great demand, and many places cannot find workers. Engineering technicians, medical personnel (including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists), and cost accountants are also in short supply. For example, the North China Military Region needs a large number of cultural instructors, but among the 600 unemployed intellectuals who applied, only 106 were qualified. In order to overcome this difficulty, on the one hand, we must do our best to run retraining programs; on the other hand, the unemployed themselves need to make great efforts to improve their employment ability.

(2) Work Relief – The originally approved number of people participating in work relief was 5,807. However, only 3,616 people reported. Among them, because some people still have a living, or have found a job, or a temporary job, the number has been reduced by more than 2,040 people. At present, about 1,570 people are actually participating in work relief. In the early stage, the work relief projects were mostly road construction. Originally, 21 projects were planned, and most of them have been completed. Just taking the construction of dirt roads in various districts as an example, more than 800 hutongs have been completed. In the future, it is planned to use the winter to carry out sewer excavation projects. In the process of project implementation, work efficiency is gradually improving, especially after the temporary wage system was changed to a piece-rate wage system, the improvement in work efficiency is very significant. For example, workers in the Chongwenmen construction site were crushing stones. Before the implementation of the piece-rate wage, each person's daily wage was 4,000 yuan, and the workers' morale was very low. After the piece-rate wage was implemented, the work efficiency was greatly improved, from the initial average of 0.1 cubic meters of crushed stone per person per day to 0.9 cubic meters. The workers' income increased from 4,000 yuan per day to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, and the expenditure was greatly reduced, from 40,000 yuan per cubic meter to 9,000 yuan. Experience has proved that using work relief to do some public projects is a good method, which is conducive to municipal construction, meets the public welfare requirements of the general public, and temporarily solves the livelihood problems of unemployed workers. In order to make work relief achieve the desired effect, it is not only necessary to do a good job in organization and education, but also to adopt a piece-rate wage system whenever possible.

(3) Retraining – The originally approved number of people participating in retraining was 2,004. A training class that can accommodate 600 people has been opened, first conducting political study to reduce the difficulty of employment. More than 390 people have participated in the study. In addition, it is planned to prepare for technical training. However, there are objective difficulties in all aspects of technical training, such as equipment, curriculum, and teachers. It is planned to first conduct trial runs in conjunction with units such as Qinghe Woolen Mill, and then promote it after gaining experience. Unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals who have participated in retraining, especially political study, generally have improved their awareness, and are more likely to be hired when separately introduced to jobs. This shows that it is best to appropriately combine job introductions with retraining.

(4) Production for Self-Relief – The originally approved number of people participating in production for self-relief was 1,291. Among them, the vast majority are female workers who have only done auxiliary work and lack production skills, making it very difficult to organize production. For example, the Municipal Cooperative General Agency once organized more than 100 people to knit wool socks, but one-quarter of the finished wool socks did not meet the standards and needed to be reworked, resulting in a loss of more than one million yuan. Therefore, technical guidance and inspection must be improved. Now more than 500 people have been introduced to the Beijing Clothing Factory to do temporary cotton padding work, and temporary relief has been given to those with particularly difficult lives.

(5) Returning to Hometown for Production – A total of 220 people have been helped to return to their hometown for production. In carrying out this work, we have adopted a serious and responsible attitude. Only those who have been reviewed and deemed to have production conditions after returning to their hometown are mobilized to return to their hometown. Facts have proved that mobilizing unemployed people to return to their hometown for production is basically correct and has achieved results in the context of excessive concentration of urban population and temporary employment difficulties.

In addition, 157 people who are sick, elderly, and unable to participate in work relief, retraining, or production for self-relief have been given simple relief. Also, 1,148 people who were originally approved to participate in the above-mentioned relief programs but have particularly difficult lives have been temporarily issued temporary relief funds before actually participating.

In general, the work of collecting relief funds is going smoothly. State-owned enterprises, government agencies' production, and other public undertakings have mostly paid. In the private industrial and commercial sector, thanks to the assistance of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade unions, the main industries have paid more than 90%. When collecting relief funds, with the consent of the workers, the factory deducts and pays on their behalf, which is a fast, simple, and effective method.

Based on the above situation, it can be seen that among the 9,411 unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals who have been registered, 4,260 people have been employed or found temporary jobs. The remaining unemployed people have also been able to barely overcome difficulties with the help of the government.

Relieving unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals is a major event, and doing this work seriously is of great significance for stabilizing people's lives and social order. As a result of our earnest and step-by-step efforts to help unemployed people find employment and provide relief, those who have received help or relief have universally reflected their support for the unemployment relief policy. Some people who have found employment said: "Without pulling strings or going through back doors, I can find a job, which is really something I never dreamed of." An unemployed elderly teacher said: "In the past, during the rule of successive reactionary governments, no one cared about me when I lost my job. In the winter, I desperately squeezed into soup kitchens, only to get a bowl of porridge. Now the government not only sends relief funds to my door, but also cadres often come to visit me. Only the people's government cares about me like this." Some elderly people who received simple relief felt uneasy after receiving the relief funds and voluntarily participated in work relief projects. These facts all show that the implementation of the unemployment relief policy is successful. However, because the relief work is a heavy organizational task, and there is currently no comprehensive summary, shortcomings in the work are inevitable. For example, the registration standards in each district are not completely consistent. Some people who should have been registered were not allowed to register, but some who should not have been registered were allowed to register.

As for the method of relieving unemployed employees that has already been implemented in the city, its main purpose is to provide convenience for some factories and large workshops to lay off some workers as necessary to improve their operations, while also guaranteeing the lives of these laid-off workers, so it will continue to be implemented temporarily. There are still 201 people receiving relief fees under this method, not included in the above 9,000 people.

In addition, we have also provided relief to ordinary poor citizens. According to a survey in July of this year, there are 6,800 poor households with no source of income or in need of temporary subsidies, with more than 18,900 people. Among them, there are more than 4,200 households and more than 12,700 people in the urban area, and more than 2,500 households and more than 6,200 people in the suburban area. According to the specific situation, we have taken different methods of work relief, immigration, distribution of relief grain, and shelter, and carried out relief. A total of more than 3,000 people participated in work relief, and each person can get an average of more than six jin of millet in wages per day. Recently, because some projects have been completed, some people have some savings in the process of work relief and have sought other livelihoods, so the number has been reduced to more than 1,200 people. In October, two batches of 374 people were immigrated to Chahar. For poor households in need of direct relief, the districts have distributed the first relief grain since November 13. For hard-working citizens, small vendors, and small handicraft workers who have labor but cannot maintain their families, a one-time relief is given, with each household receiving 25 jin of millet for one person, 50 jin for two people, and no more than 100 jin at most; for poor citizens who are old, weak, disabled, widowed, or lonely, relief is given on a monthly basis, with each household receiving 30 jin of millet per month for one person, 60 jin for two people, and no more than 80 jin at most; for those who have suffered unexpected disasters that affect their lives, temporary relief is given according to the circumstances. As of November 26, the distribution in various districts of the urban area has been completed, with a total of 210,000 jin of millet distributed, providing relief to 3,868 households and 10,979 people. The suburbs are still in progress. In the work, some districts were able to combine with the masses, deeply publicize the policy, and conduct serious reviews, so the results were better, and it was done more fairly and timely; some districts did poorly and still need to improve. From the end of September to December 15, a total of 1,287 beggars on the streets, disaster victims from other places, or poor people with no source of livelihood were sheltered. Among them, 624 were elderly, weak, or disabled, accounting for 49% of the total, and were housed in nursing homes; 428 were young and middle-aged, accounting for 33% of the total, and were temporarily housed in vocational training centers, preparing to immigrate to the northwest to participate in agricultural production in the future; 235 were child beggars, accounting for 18% of the total, and were housed in orphanages, planning to conduct long-term education in a part-work, part-study manner.

China has never had an unemployment insurance system. This systematic relief for unemployed workers and poor citizens is still a pioneering undertaking. Facts have proved that carrying out such unemployment relief is necessary and possible, and the resolution made by the last representative conference was completely correct.

Secondly, I will report on the work of universally convening district people's representative conferences:

Since the last Municipal People's Representative Conference, based on the report of Vice Chairman Qian Duansheng of the Municipal Consultative Committee, passed the resolution on universally convening district people's representative conferences, the districts in the city have successively convened them. By the end of August, the first district people's representative conferences in all districts had been completed. Facts have proved that after the universal convening of district people's representative conferences, people's democracy has been further developed, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. It not only enabled the government and the people to have a closer connection, so that the people's opinions can be reflected more timely, but also enabled the government's policies to be more deeply implemented into the masses through the district people's representative conferences. At the same time, through the district people's representative conferences, the People's Government and its cadres, under the supervision and criticism of the people, have also improved their work style and improved work efficiency.

These gains are mainly reflected in the implementation of resolutions by the People's Government. The first district people's representative conferences in the city's nine districts received a total of 21,410 proposals. Among them, in addition to the 1,132 criticisms of cadres' work style, the vast majority were proposals related to public welfare. After these proposals were approved by the conferences, the district people's governments (i.e., district offices) have worked hard to implement them with a serious and responsible spirit. Those that need to be done by the Municipal People's Government have been transferred to the Municipal People's Government for implementation. As of now, the vast majority of all proposals that the government can handle have been completed, some even exceeding the requirements of the original proposals; some are still being processed; and explanations and explanations have been made to the representatives and the original proposers for a few that cannot be handled. For example, among the 206 proposals in the first district people's representative conference in the Third District that were resolved to be handled by the government, 204 have been handled. Among the 274 proposals that were resolved to be transferred to relevant departments for reference, 146 have now been handled. As a result of the implementation of various proposals related to public welfare, in terms of road repairs: the Seventh District has repaired 78 dirt roads in five months, accounting for 27% of all roads in the district. The Third District originally planned to repair 96, but repaired 121. In terms of house repairs: the First and Seventh Districts alone repaired 5,622 rooms, accounting for 85.5% of the total number of houses that should be repaired in the two districts. In solving the problem of school-age children dropping out of school: the Fourth District alone added two formal primary schools with 50 classes and 1,550 students this fall. In other municipal construction: the city added 2,000 street lamps in remote areas, built 410 cesspools, and built 108 public toilets. And installed tap water pipes and built tap water stations in areas without tap water. The Seventh and Ninth Districts alone installed more than 7,200 meters of tap water pipes, built 52 tap water stations, and renovated 33 private wells. All these municipal constructions related to public welfare, which were realized in a short period of time, met the most urgent needs of the general public, and therefore were supported by the general public, who reflected: "The government is truly implementing the resolution to the letter," "Our words are effective, our demands have been realized," "We are truly in charge and become masters," "It is truly a 'people's' 'democratic' government."

The above work achievements are inseparable from the active joint efforts of the representatives of the district people's representative conferences and the broad masses of the people, and are also inseparable from doing a good job in mass organization. For example, in the aspect of road repairs, all districts have organized road repair committees composed of district and street representatives to mobilize and organize citizens in various streets to personally repair the roads. The Seventh District alone mobilized 4,000 to 5,000 people before and after, and repaired about 6,000 meters of dirt roads. In terms of house repairs, all districts convened landlords and tenants through the house repair committee to jointly negotiate solutions, which yielded great results. For example, the House Repair Committee of the Sixth District accepted more than 1,700 house disputes, and more than 1,600 cases were resolved through mediation and negotiation between the two parties. If it does not rely on the masses to solve it, it will not get such rapid processing if it relies solely on the government to conduct mediation. In the aspect of adding primary schools and adult night schools, district and street representatives enthusiastically assisted the government in finding school buildings and borrowing tables and chairs. For example, Xiaoyou Primary School in the Fourth District and Nanheyan Primary School in the Fifth District were established with the help of district and street representatives to solve the school building problem; in the aspect of adding infiltration wells, district and street representatives have also mobilized the masses to do a lot of things. For example, the masses in the Second District dug 730 simple infiltration pits by themselves, solving the difficulty of no place to dump sewage for more than 3,500 households. Other tasks such as vaccination are also completed with the enthusiastic support of representatives and the broad masses of the people. The activities of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and consolidating the revolutionary order have also often received the assistance of the people. This proves that the representatives elected by the people of all strata can represent the opinions of the people of all strata; it is also correct and successful to establish various specialized committees under the district consultation committee, such as the House Repair Committee, Health Committee, Culture and Education Committee, and Social Relief Committee, and to absorb a large number of activists to participate in various municipal construction and public welfare work on a voluntary basis. However, individual districts do not pay enough attention to the district consultation committee, and do not bring important issues in the government's work to the consultation committee for discussion and research, and do not rely well on the consultation committee and its various specialized committees to carry out work, which should be corrected in the future. Some individual districts use representatives as administrative cadres and assign them too much work, so some representatives feel that being a representative is a burden, which also needs to be corrected urgently. Secondly, some representatives and activists hold multiple positions, and they are too busy to work, which also affects and restricts more representatives and activists from participating in work. Therefore, it is best for representatives and activists to participate in one specialized committee.

In the representative conferences in various districts, the inspection and criticism of the work style of government staff has a great effect on correcting the bureaucratic and commanding style of cadres. The proposals on criticizing cadres' work style in the first representative conferences in various districts have been dealt with separately; some cadres have admitted their mistakes to the representatives at the representative conferences; some cadres have recognized their mistakes afterwards and have publicly made self-criticism to the masses. Among them, those with more serious mistakes have been punished separately; a few who stand on the heads of the people, oppress the masses, and are corrupt have been dismissed and punished separately; after the investigation of misunderstandings, explanations and explanations have also been made to the masses. Through the district people's representative conferences, the method of criticism and self-criticism is effective for the education and improvement of cadres. Generally, cadres have strengthened their serious and responsible attitude towards the people and work, and wholeheartedly serve the people. They are more conscientious and hardworking than in the past, making great progress in their work. The relationship between cadres and the masses has also been further improved. Therefore, at the second district people's representative conferences recently held in various districts, the representatives reflected that the cadres' work style has improved. At the last conference, there were a total of 1,132 proposals on criticizing cadres' work style in various districts, while this time there were only 213 proposals on cadres' work style, among which there were 85 proposals praising cadres. The representatives praised the cadres for their exemplary deeds of rescuing collapsed houses in the rain and striving to help unemployed employees find employment. However, there are also a few cadres who have been criticized and are showing a phenomenon of not daring to take responsibility and relaxing their work. This is a mistake. After review and education, it has been gradually corrected.

Recently, various districts have convened the second district people's representative conferences. In addition to solving specific problems that adapt to the specific situations and requirements of each district, generally, the following three issues are used as the central topics: (1) Collect and discuss citizens' opinions on public welfare to help the Municipal People's Government formulate next year's municipal construction plan; (2) Continue to adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to review and improve the work and work style of the District People's Government; (3) Discuss strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionary work and further consolidate the revolutionary order in the capital. It has been completed one after another, with better performance and more gains than the last conference.

Comrade Representatives! This is my report on the two tasks of unemployment relief and the universal convening of district people's representative conferences on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Please review and criticize it at the conference.

    失业救济和普遍召开区各界人民代表会议的两项工作
    京市吴晗副市长在京市第二届第四次各界人民代表会议上的报告各位代表：
    这次市各界人民代表会议主要是讨论时局问题和下届代表会议代表产生办法。因此，我不打算报告三个多月中间，市人民政府所做的一般工作，只是把上次会议特别作出决议，交给市人民政府办的两项重要工作——即失业救济和普遍召开区各界人民代表会议——的进行情况，简要报告一下。（另外还有公安局罗局长关于一年来镇压反革命分子破坏活动的报告）
    首先，报告失业救济工作：
    北京市解放以来，失业人口较解放前，是大大减少了，但失业问题并没有完全解决。据今年七月间的调查，失业工人和失业知识分子还有万余人。关于这个问题，在上次代表会议上，市协商委员会刘仁副主席曾做了详细报告，并提出了具体的救济方案，经大会决议，认为可以全部施行。三个多月来，执行的结果，已经获得初步成绩。
    本来，在上次代表会议召开以前，我们就已根据政务院《关于救济失业工人的指示》和《救济失业工人暂行办法》，于七月二十二日，成立了失业工人救济委员会，从七月二十四日起，开始了分区登记失业工人的工作。（这种分区登记的办法，对于失业工人的联系、组织和教育，都便于集中处理，是较好地完成登记任务的一条经验。）截至十一月底止，共登记了九千四百十一人，其中，失业工人（包括产业工人、手工业工人、店员、搬运工人）约占十分之七，失业知识分子（包括教员、职员和一部分中等以上学生）约占十分之三。如果除去在七月调查以后，因雨季淹窑而暂时失业的矿工一千九百三十三人。那就只有七千四百七十八人，约为原调查的失业人数的百分之七十三。现在登记工作已近尾声，继续来登记的人已不多了。登记开始后，我们即一面登记，一面按照上次市代表会议通过的方案分别处理，或帮助其就业。进行情况如下：
    （一）就业——据十一月下旬的调查，已就业的达四千二百六十人，约为登记总数的百分之四十五。其中，已经找到固定工作的，三千一百二十二人，找到临时工作的一千一百三十八人。除去门头沟复工的矿工以外，据不完全统计参加工矿企业的有一千一百余人，参加机关学校的有八百五十余人，参加商业的有四百九十余人，参加交通运输事业的有二百余人。
    在介绍就业时最大的问题就是许多失业者还不能适应新的生产要求，一方面有许多失业的人，找不到工作；另一方面，又有许多工作需要人而找不到人。例如：机械工、电机工都十分缺乏，许多地方都找不到工人。工程技术人员、医务人员（包括医生、护士、司药）和成本会计人员，也都供不应求。又如，华北军区需要大批的文化教员，而投考的六百个失业知识分子当中，合格的才不过一百零六人。为了克服这个困难，一方面，要尽可能地办好转业训练；另一方面也需要失业的人本身作极大努力来提高就业能力。
    （二）以工代赈——原核定参加以工代赈的共五千八百零七人。而报到的只有三千六百十六人。其中，因为有些人生活还有着落，或已找到职业，或临时工作，又陆续减少了二千零四十余人。目前，实际参加以工代赈的约一千五百七十余人。以工代赈的工程，前一时期大半是修建道路，原来计划了二十一项，现已大部完工，仅以修筑各区土路一项计算，就已完成了八百多条胡同的土路。今后，计划利用冬季进行掏挖下水道工程。在工程进行的过程中，工作的效率是逐渐提高的，特别是由临时工资改为计件工资制后，工作效率的提高非常显著。如崇文门工地工人砸石头，在实行计件工资前，每人每日工资四千元，工人情绪很低，改行计件工资后，工作效率大大提高，由最初每人每日平均砸石零点一方，迅速提高到零点九方，工人收入则由每日四千元增加到七、八千元，而经费开支也大为减少，由每方四万元减至九千元。经验证明，利用以工代赈的方式去做一些公共工程是一个好办法，既有利于市政建设，满足了广大市民对公共福利的要求，同时又暂时解决了失业工人的生活问题。而要使以工代赈，收到预期的效果，不仅要把组教工作做好，而且能够采取计件工资制的，最好采取计件工资制。
    （三）转业训练——原核定参加转业训练的共二千零四人。现已开办一所可容六百人的训练班，先进行政治学习，以减少就业时的困难。参加学习的已有三百九十余人。此外，并计划筹办技术训练。但举办技术训练，在设备、课程、教员等各方面，都存在着客观困难。拟先和清河制呢厂等单位结合试办，俟取得经验后，再为推广。失业工人和失业知识分子参加过转业训练，特别是政治学习的，一般地觉悟是提高了，分别介绍职业时，也比较容易被录用。这说明介绍职业最好和转业训练适当结合起来。
    （四）生产自救——原核定参加生产自救的一千二百九十一人。其中，绝大部分是仅作过辅助工作的女工，缺乏生产技能，组织生产，非常困难。例如市合作总社曾组织一百多人打毛袜，但打成的毛袜有四分之一不合标准，需要反工，损失了一百多万元。所以，在技术指导和检查方面，还须力求改进。现在有五百余人已介绍到北京被服厂，做临时铺棉工作，生活特别困难的，已给予临时救济。
    （五）还乡生产——经帮助还乡生产的，共二百二十人。在进行这一工作时，我们是采取认真负责态度的。只有经过审查认为还乡后，确有生产条件的，才动员其还乡。事实证明：动员失业的人还乡生产，在城市人口过度集中，暂时还有就业困难的情况下，基本上是对的，而且也是有成绩的。
    此外，因患病、年老不能参加以工代赈、转业训练或生产自救的一百五十七人已给予单纯救济。还有原已核定参加上述各项救济而生活特别困难的一千一百四十八人，在实际参加前，都暂时发给了临时救济金。
    关于救济金的征收工作，一般地说来，进行是顺利的。国营事业、机关生产及其他公共事业，已大部缴纳。私营工商业方面，由于得到工商联合会和工会的帮助，主要行业缴纳的已超过百分之九十。征收救济金时，在得到工人的同意后，由厂方代为扣缴，是迅速、简便、有效的办法。
    根据以上的情况，可以看出：在已经登记的九千四百十一个失业工人和失业知识分子当中，已有四千二百六十人就业或找到了临时工作。其余没有就业的人，也在政府的帮助之下，都已能够勉强度过困难。
    救济失业工人和失业知识分子是一件大事情，认真地作好这件事情，对于安定人民生活，稳定社会秩序是有重大意义的。由于我们认真地、有步骤地，帮助失业的人就业和加以救济的结果，得到帮助或救济的人普遍反映了对失业救济政策的拥护。有的已就业的人说：“不走窗子，不钻门子，就可以找到职业，真是梦想不到的事。”一位失业的年老教员说：“过去历届反动政府统治时期，失了业都没有人理会我，到了冬天，拼命去挤粥厂，只能喝到一碗粥，现在政府不但把救济金送上门来，而且干部还常来拜访我，只有人民的政府才这样关心我。”有些得到单纯救济的老年人领了救济金以后，感到不安，自动参加以工代赈工程。这些事实都说明着实行失业救济政策是成功的。但是，由于救济工作是一件繁重的组织工作，而且目前还没有全面的总结，工作中的缺点在所难免，例如各区登记标准不完全一致，有些应该登记的没有让登记，但也有些不应该登记的反而让登记了。
    至于本市前已实行的，救济失业员工的办法，其主要目的是给一些工厂和大作坊为了改善经营而必要解雇一部分工人以便利条件，同时，又可以保障这些被解雇的工人的生活，所以暂仍继续执行。根据这个办法领取救济费的，还有二百零一人，不包括在上述九千多人以内。
    此外，对于一般的贫苦市民，我们也进行了救济。根据今年七月间的调查，生活全无来源和需要暂时补助的贫苦户共六千八百多户，一万八千九百多人。其中在城区的四千二百多户，一万二千七百多人，在郊区的二千五百多户，六千二百多人。我们根据具体情况，分别采取了以工代赈、移民、发救济粮和收容等方法，进行了救济。计：参加以工代赈的三千余人，每人每天平均可得到六斤多小米的工资。最近，因为有些工程已完工，在以工代赈过程中，有些人有了些积蓄，已另谋生计，故已减少到一千二百多人。十月间，向察北移民两批，共三百七十四人。对于需要直接救济的贫苦户，已由各区于十一月十三日起，分别发放第一次救济粮。对于有劳动力而不能维持全家生活的劳苦市民、小商贩、小手工业者，给以一次救济，每户一人发小米二十五斤，二人发五十斤，最多不超过一百斤；对于老弱、残废、鳏寡孤独的贫苦市民，按月救济，每月每户一人发三十斤，二人发六十斤，最多不超过八十斤；对于遭意外灾害而影响生活的，酌量情况，给以临时救济。到十一月二十六日城区各区已发放完毕，计共发出小米二十一万斤，救济了三千八百六十八户，一万零九百七十九人。郊区还正在进行。在工作中，有些区能够结合群众，深入宣传政策，并进行认真的审查，成绩就比较好，也做得比较公平及时；有些区做得较差，还需要改进。对于流落街头的乞丐，外来灾民，或生活全无着落的贫民，从九月底起到十二月十五日止共收容了一千二百八十七人，其中有老弱残废六百二十四名占总数的百分之四十九，收养在安老所；青壮年四百二十八名，占总数百分之三十三，暂时收容在习艺所，准备将来移民西北参加农业生产；童丐二百三十五名，占总数百分之十八，收容在育幼所，拟以半工半读方式进行长期教育。
    中国历来没有过失业保险制度，这次对于失业工人和贫苦市民系统地进行救济还是一个创举。事实证明：进行这样的失业救济，是必要的，也是可能的，上次代表会议所做的决议是完全正确的。
    其次，报告普遍召开区各界人民代表会议的工作：
    自上次市各界人民代表会议，根据市协商委员会钱端升副主席的报告，通过了普遍召开区各界人民代表会议的决议后，城内各区即先后召开。到八月底，各区第一次各界人民代表会议都已开完。事实证明：普遍召开区各界人民代表会议以后，进一步发扬了人民民主，更加巩固了人民民主专政，不仅使政府和人民有了更加密切的联系，使人民的意见可以更及时地反映上来，而且也使政府的政策经过区各界人民代表会议更深入地贯彻到群众中去。同时，经过了区各界人民代表会议，人民政府及其干部在人民群众的监督和批评下，也改善了工作作风，提高了工作效率。
    这些收获，主要表现在人民政府对决议案的执行上。全市九个区第一次各界人民代表会议共收到提案两万一千四百一十件，其中除了批评干部作风的一千一百三十二件外，绝大部分都是有关公共福利的提案。这些提案经会议通过后，各区人民政府（即区公所）都抱着严肃认真负责的精神，努力执行。需要市人民政府做的，则转请市人民政府执行。截至现在，全部提案中凡是政府能办的，绝大部分都已经完成了，有些甚至超过了原提案的要求；一部分正在继续办理；少数不能办的，也都向代表和原提案人做了解释和说明。例如第三区第一次各界人民代表会议提案中，经决议要政府办理的二百零六件，已经办理了二百零四件。经决议转给各有关部门参考的，有二百七十四件，现在也办理了一百四十六件。执行有关公共福利的各种提案的结果，就修整道路来说：第七区五个多月来一共修整了土路七十八条，占全区全部道路的百分之二十七。第三区原计划修整九十六条，结果修整了一百二十一条。就修缮房屋来说：仅第一、七两区即修缮了五千六百二十二间，占该两区应修缮房屋总数的百分之八十五点五。在解决失学儿童入学方面：仅第四区今年秋季即增设正式小学二处，五十个班，学生一千五百五十人。在其他市政建设方面：全市在偏僻地区添装路灯二千盏，修建秽水池四百零一座，修建公共厕所一百零八所。并在没有自来水的地区按装了自来水管，修筑了自来水站，仅第七、九两区就按装了自来水管七千二百多公尺，修筑自来水站五十二处，改造私人水井三十三处。所有这些在短时期内便实现了的有关公共福利的市政建设，满足了广大市民的最迫切的要求，因而也就得到了广大人民的拥护，他们纷纷反映：“政府真是在不折不扣地执行决议”，“我们的话有效了，我们的要求实现了”，“我们真正当了家，做了主人”，“真是‘人民’‘民主’政府”。
    获得以上的工作成绩，是和区各界人民代表会议的代表以及广大人民的积极的共同努力分不开的，也是和做好群众组织工作分不开的。例如在整修道路方面，各区都组织了以区街代表为主的修路委员会，去动员和组织各街道的市民亲自动手修整道路。仅第七区即前后发动了四、五千人，修整了约六千公尺的土路。在修缮房屋方面，各区都是通过房屋修缮委员会，召集房东、房客双方共同协商解决，收获很大。例如第六区房屋修缮委员会共受理了一千七百余件房屋纠纷，经过调解，双方协商解决的就有一千六百余件。如果不依靠群众来解决。单单依靠政府去进行调解，那就不会得到这样迅速的处理。在增设小学、成人夜校方面，区街代表纷纷热心协助政府找校舍、借棹椅。例如第四区的孝友小学，第五区的南河沿小学，都是在区街代表的努力帮助下，解决了校舍问题而成立起来的；在增设渗水井方面，区街代表也曾发动群众作了不少事情，例如第二区群众自己动手，添挖了简易渗水坑七百三十个，解决了三千五百多户无处倾倒污水的困难。其他如注射预防针等工作，也同样是依靠代表和广大人民的热烈支持所完成的。在镇压反革命分子的活动，巩固革命秩序的工作上，也经常地得到了人民的协助。这就证明：由各阶层人民推选出来的代表是能够代表各阶层人民的意见的；在区协商委员会之下，设立各种专门委员会，如房屋修缮委员会、卫生委员会、文教委员会、社会救济委员会等，通过这些委员会，吸收大批积极分子在自愿的基础上参加各项市政建设和公共福利工作，也是正确的，成功的。但有个别的区对于区协商委员会重视不够，没有把政府工作中的重要问题提到协商委员会来讨论研究，没有很好依靠协商委员会及其所属各种专门委员会去进行工作，这是今后应当注意纠正的。也有个别的区把代表当做一个行政干部来使用，过多地向他们布置工作，因而使得有些代表感到当代表是一个负担，这也是亟待纠正的。其次，有些代表和积极分子身兼数职，工作忙不过来，也影响和限制了更多的代表和积极分子来参加工作。因此，代表和积极分子以参加一个专门委员会为最好。
    在各区的代表会议上，对政府工作人员的作风所进行的检查和批评，对于纠正干部官僚主义和命令主义的作风是有很大作用的。各区第一次代表会议关于批评干部作风的提案已经分别处理；有的干部已在代表大会上向代表承认了错误；有的干部在事后，认识了自己的错误，向群众公开进行了自我批评。其中，错误比较严重的，都已分别受到了处分；少数站在人民头上，欺压群众，贪污腐化的分子已分别撤职惩办；事出误会的，事后经过调查，也向群众做了解释和说明，通过区各界人民代表会议，采取批评和自我批评的方法，对于干部的教育和提高是有效的，一般干部都加强了对人民、对工作严肃负责，全心全意为人民服务的观点，比过去更加兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳地努力工作，使工作大大提高了一步，干部和群众的关系也更加改善了。因此，最近在各区召开的第二次区各界人民代表会议时，代表们纷纷反映干部的作风变好了。上次会议时各区关于批评干部作风的提案共有一千一百三十二件，而这次关于干部作风的提案仅有二百十三件，其中，并有表扬干部的提案八十五件。代表们对干部冒雨抢救倒塌的房屋，努力帮助失业员工就业等模范事绩都进行了表扬。但也有少数干部因受到了批评，而在工作中表现着不敢负责，放松工作的现象。这是一种错误。经过检讨与教育后，已逐步改正。
    最近，各区都曾召开第二次区各界人民代表会议，除了解决适应各区自身情况和要求的具体问题外，一般，是把下面三个问题做为中心议题：（１）搜集与讨论市民对于公共福利方面的意见，以便帮助市人民政府拟定明年的市政建设计划；（２）继续采取批评和自我批评的方法，来检讨与改善区人民政府的工作和干部作风；（３）讨论加强镇压反革命的工作，进一步巩固首都革命秩序。现已陆续开完，比较上次会议有更好的表现更多的收获。
    各位代表！这就是我代表北京市人民政府关于失业救济和普遍召开区各界人民代表会议两项工作的报告，请大会审查与批评。
