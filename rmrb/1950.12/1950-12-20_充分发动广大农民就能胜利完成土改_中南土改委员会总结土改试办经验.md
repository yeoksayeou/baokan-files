Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 16th: The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee's Land Reform Committee conducted a review and summary of the pilot land reform work in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces in mid-November. It concluded that due to the varying degrees of mass mobilization, the work in the two provinces had resulted in three different outcomes: villages that fully mobilized the broad masses of peasants and thus victoriously completed land reform accounted for approximately 20%; villages where the peasants were fundamentally not mobilized and the ruling power of the landlord class was not overthrown, resulting in a half-baked state of land reform, accounted for about 30%; and the remaining 50% fell somewhere in between, meaning that peasants had received some preliminary education and mobilization, and the feudal forces had also been somewhat attacked and weakened, but the work was not very thorough.

Villages that victoriously completed land reform by mobilizing the broad masses of peasants generally had more thorough preparation work. Having gone through the anti-despot and rent reduction campaigns of the spring, as well as the struggle to rectify peasant associations and oppose illegal landlords' sabotage activities in the summer, they had a relatively strong and powerful peasant force tempered by struggle. For example, in the villages where land reform was piloted in the Fuliang Special District of Jiangxi, peasant association members had already reached about 15% of the rural population during the rent reduction campaign this spring. This summer, the Fuliang Special District also sent three work teams to the countryside to rectify the peasant associations and mobilize peasants to fight against the sabotage activities of illegal landlords, effectively striking at the reactionary arrogance of the landlord class. Therefore, as soon as the land reform movement began, the peasants' enthusiasm was very high, and the peasant association membership rapidly expanded to more than 27% of the population in each village, forcing the landlord class to bow its head. As a result, the confiscation and distribution of land and other work proceeded smoothly. Secondly, these villages generally paid attention to ideological education for peasants, especially poor and hired peasants. At the beginning, Nanhu Township in Changde County, Hunan, neglected ideological mobilization of the peasants, which prevented the movement from unfolding for a long time. Later, by enlightening poor and hired peasants to pour out their grievances, their class consciousness was raised, and a vigorous mass emancipation movement was formed. Similarly, in Nanchang County, Jiangxi, the policy education for peasants was more thorough. During the classification of class status, peasants were mobilized to engage in reasoning struggles with landlords who attempted to lower their class status, exposing the facts of feudal exploitation by the landlords, which greatly enhanced the consciousness and enthusiasm of the peasants.

Conversely, the villages with a half-baked state of land reform were all due to the failure to mobilize the broad masses of peasants, especially the poor and hired peasants. Many cadres did not actively lead the peasant masses to oppose feudal forces and lead the peasants to act in accordance with policies. Instead, they failed to mobilize the masses, and a small number of cadres took over the entire process of land distribution. Or, when mobilizing the masses, they acted timidly and dared not let go boldly. During this pilot program, some villages in Jiangxi and Hunan publicized the Land Reform Law without publicizing the purpose of land reform and the justice of the masses rising up to carry out the anti-feudal struggle, but instead tried to restrain the peasants in every way. Some work teams conducted land reform preparation work in rural areas, detached from reality, and isolated themselves to investigate the situation, survey fields, and rectify peasant teams. However, they failed to mobilize the masses to crack down on the illegal behaviors of illegal landlords such as dispersing land, concealing property, and spreading rumors to undermine the effort. Facts have proven this to be wrong. For example, in Nanhu Township, Changde County, Hunan, the work team investigated for ten consecutive days, but the landlords' land and population were not clearly investigated. It was only after the peasant masses rose up that they exposed the land concealed and the population falsely reported by the landlords. When classifying class status and confiscating and distributing land, some pilot villages simply talked about procedures and went through the motions, without actively mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, so that feudal forces could not be overthrown, land was not confiscated thoroughly, distribution was not fair, and most importantly, the demands of poor and hired peasants with little or no land were not adequately met.

Therefore, the Central-South Land Reform Committee specifically calls on all land reform work teams and all working cadres to earnestly implement the line of relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants, to mobilize the broad masses of peasants, to raise the consciousness of the peasants, to carry out the anti-feudal mass struggle in the countryside, and to fully utilize peasant representative conferences to gradually unfold the land reform movement from points to areas, so as to ensure the victorious completion of land reform in the Central-South region with a population of 60 million.

    充分发动广大农民就能胜利完成土改
    中南土改委员会总结土改试办经验
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中南军政委员会土地改革委员会在十一月中旬就江西、湖南两省土地改革的试办工作进行了一次检查和总结，认为该两省的试办工作，由于发动群众的程度不同，产生了三种不同的结果：充分发动了广大农民，因而胜利地完成了土地改革的乡约占百分之二十；农民根本未发动起来，地主阶级的统治势力未推翻，使土地改革造成半生不熟的状态的约占百分之三十；另百分之五十介于两者之间，即对农民已有初步的教育和发动，对封建势力也有一些打击和削弱，但工作还不很彻底。
    发动了广大农民胜利完成了土地改革的乡，一般是准备工作较充分，经过今春的反恶霸和减租，以及今夏整顿农民协会和反对不法地主破坏活动的斗争，已有一支较为坚强有力，经过斗争锻炼的农民队伍。例如江西浮梁专区试办土地改革的各乡，大部分在今春减租时，农民协会会员就已达农村人口的百分之十五左右。今年夏天浮梁专区又派了三个工作队下乡整顿农民协会，发动农民向不法地主的破坏活动作了斗争，有效地打击了地主阶级的反动气焰。所以这次土地改革运动一开始，农民积极性就很高，农民协会会员亦迅速扩大到占各乡人口的百分之二十七以上，迫使地主阶级不得不低头，因此，土地的没收、分配等工作都很顺利。其次，这些乡在工作中一般都注意对农民，特别是对贫雇农的思想教育。湖南常德县南湖乡开始时忽视对农民思想上的发动工作，致运动很久不能展开。后经启发贫雇农民诉苦，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，才形成了一个轰轰烈烈的群众翻身运动。同样，江西南昌县对农民的政策教育较深入，划阶级时又发动农民向企图降低成份的地主进行了说理斗争，揭露了地主的封建剥削的事实，也大大提高了农民的觉悟和积极性。
    相反的，土地改革半生不熟的状态的乡，都是因为没有把广大农民，特别是贫农雇农发动起来。许多干部不是积极地领导农民群众反对封建势力，领导农民起来按政策办事，而是不发动群众，由少数干部包办代替去分田，或者是在发动群众时表现缩手缩脚，不敢大胆放手。这次试办，江西和湖南的一些乡宣传土地改革法，没有宣传土地改革的目的，和群众起来进行反封建斗争的正义性，而是处处去束缚农民。有些工作队在农村中进行土地改革准备工作，脱离实际，孤立地在那里调查情况、清丈田亩、整顿农民队伍；对于不法地主的分散土地、隐蔽财产、造谣破坏等非法行为，却不发动群众起来加以击破。事实证明这是错误的。例如这次工作队在湖南常德县南湖乡一连调查了十几天，地主的土地、人口却没有调查清楚，还是农民群众起来后才揭发了地主隐瞒的土地和虚报的人口。在进行划阶级、没收和分配土地时，有些试办乡也只是单纯地讲步骤、走过场，没有使广大农民积极行动起来，以致封建势力未能打倒，土地没收的不彻底，分配的不公平，最重要的是无地少地的贫雇农的要求没有获得适当的满足。
    为此，中南土地改革委员会特号召所有土地改革工作队，所有工作干部，认真贯彻依靠贫雇农团结中农的路线，把广大农民发动起来，提高农民的觉悟，开展农村中反封建的群众斗争；并充分运用农民代表会议，使土地改革运动由点到面逐渐展开，以保证中南六千万人口地区的土地改革胜利完成。
