    Experiences from Rural Chahar in Launching a Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign
    Li Dayou, Ding Xuezhi, Tian Yuan

    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Chahar Province has gradually penetrated every corner of the countryside. Through various forms of propaganda, the masses' understanding of the current situation has been initially clarified, their hatred of American imperialism has surged, and their determination to defend their homes and country has been inspired, thereby driving the vast masses to engage in the entire movement. The masses in Huailai, Wanquan, Yuxian, and Yangyuan are expressing their support for the Chinese People's Volunteers by completing their public grain quotas and improving winter production; young people are volunteering to enlist and go to Korea to fight. The entire Chahar region completed the task of delivering 55 million catties of public grain to the granaries in less than twenty days.

    Conducting in-depth and widespread Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda in the countryside is an arduous process of ideological mobilization and education. Before their awareness is raised, farmers have a vague understanding of American imperialism, do not understand its consistent crimes of aggression against China, and cannot see its ferocious and brutal face. However, after various propaganda, education, and enlightenment efforts, they began to recognize the brutality, baseness, and detestability of American imperialism, felt they could no longer tolerate it, and were filled with boundless anger, actively taking practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. The rural atmosphere suddenly became tense.

    In Chahar, the following methods are mainly adopted to carry out Resist America, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country propaganda:

    1.  Carry out in-depth anti-American education within various organizations. Rural branches of the Party, Youth League, women's federations, militia, schools, reading groups, and other organizations all held discussion meetings to expose the crimes of American imperialism's aggression against China, explain that American imperialism is a paper tiger, arouse the masses' hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism, and inspire enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea. For example, after the women of Sujiaqiao Village in Wanquan County held a discussion meeting, their awareness was greatly raised, and they immediately pledged to do a good job in the autumn grain collection, sanitation, and production work to support the Korean people. After the militia in the southeast street of Tianzhen held a discussion, they saw through the sinister nature of American imperialism and, in addition to signing up to go to Korea to resist America, also pledged to do a good job in maintaining public security in the rear and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. After the reading group in Xinzhuangzi, Huailai, finished reading the newspaper, the people who listened to the report held a discussion and unanimously hated American imperialism, immediately launching a wave of grain delivery the next day.

    2.  Give play to the vanguard role of Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and model worker representatives, using them as the backbone to unite and mobilize the masses, creating a lively and enthusiastic Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Wang Lin, the Party branch secretary of Mengjia Yaozi Village in Zhuolu County, is a model worker. He actively united and educated the farmers in the village, raising everyone's political awareness. Currently, 39 young men and women in the village have volunteered to go to Korea to resist America. Yu Chang (national agricultural model worker representative) of Wayaogou, Huaian County, vigorously exposed the crimes of American imperialism in the village, and the village's public grain was quickly delivered to the granaries. After Wang Guilan, a people's representative from Huailai County, returned to the village from a meeting in the province, she actively mobilized and organized the masses to deliver public grain and engage in production, and spoke everywhere about the crimes of American imperialism, launching a wave of Resist America, Aid Korea throughout the village.

    3.  Use all forms to carry out in-depth propaganda and arouse the righteous indignation of the masses. Cadres, teachers, and students in Huailai formed ten propaganda teams, going from the city to the countryside, penetrating every corner of the rural areas; widely using drama, peep shows, storytelling, cartoons, bulletins, and other forms to publicize the crimes of American imperialism, arousing the masses' hatred for American imperialism. When the drama performed the crimes of the Americans and Syngman Rhee, the masses shouted: "Beat them to death! Beat them to death!"

    4.  Seize every opportunity to carry out propaganda. Wanquan, Huailai, and other counties are explaining and discussing the crimes of American imperialism, why American imperialism is a paper tiger, and other issues in training classes. Fourteen village Party member cadres in the Huailai rectification training class immediately signed up to volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the war. The staff of the granaries in various counties generally use the opportunity of farmers delivering grain to carry out Resist America, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country propaganda. More than 20 people from the Chahar Special District Highway Maintenance Section were waiting to depart to repair roads. The staff of the section immediately seized the opportunity to hold a discussion meeting, making them more clearly aware of the hideous face of American imperialism.

    5.  Conduct individual talks with farmers or use the form of recounting sufferings and recalling the past at discussion meetings to arouse the masses' anti-American sentiments. When Party member Ren Pin of the Tianzhen Party Training Class recalled the situation of his family property being robbed and his wife being taken away, he was very resentful and realized that this suffering was given by American imperialism, and he immediately requested to go to Korea to resist America. The farmers of Yin Wencun compared the past suffering days with today's happy life, determined to defend their good life, and shouted the slogan "If we lack grain and grass, we have it, pick up the guns and become soldiers."

    6.  Village primary school teachers, students, and petty intellectuals play a significant role in rural propaganda and are the main force in rural propaganda work. They can not only persist for a long time, but also go deep into households, and primary school students can also carry out family propaganda and discussions at home. Bai Xiuying and other primary school students in Yaozitou, Huailai, are propagating the crimes of American imperialism everywhere in the village, and the villagers pay close attention to listening. Lian Ke, a petty intellectual in Xinzhuangzi, reads the newspaper to the villagers every day, which is very enlightening to the masses.

    7.  The development of rural art will greatly strengthen the propaganda work of current events. On the first day of the rural art training class opened in the Chahar District, a Resist America, Aid Korea clapper talk was compiled, which was very vivid. After training is completed in December, this new force will return to the countryside and greatly enhance the propaganda power of Resist America, Aid Korea in the countryside.

    8.  Propaganda must be combined with practical actions. The characteristic of this Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda is that after the masses have a further understanding of the current situation through propaganda, they immediately take action, such as requesting to go to Korea to participate in the war and actively paying public grain. Only through practical actions can the masses' level of awareness be more consolidated and improved.

    9.  In conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, educate and mobilize the masses to expose all rumors, monitor, report, and suppress the sabotage and other reactionary behaviors of special agents, reactionary landlords, rich peasants, Taoist sects, secret societies, and others. In general, propaganda in various places is closely combined with resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The militia and the masses have further clarified their understanding of this in their thinking, so the resistance to American aggression and aid to Korea has also reduced resistance in rural propaganda.

    10. Clarify and attach importance to the development and deepening of this movement from top to bottom. Every cadre has carried out a series of current affairs studies in depth, mastered rich propaganda materials, and overcome the past bias of "having nothing to say" or "saying the wrong things" during propaganda. And put forward the slogan "Combine the central work with resisting America and aiding Korea; in order to resist America and aid Korea, it is necessary to do a good job in the central work." Therefore, the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in various places is closely combined with the central work, enriching the content of the central work and making the content of resisting America and aiding Korea more in-depth and practical.

    察南农村掀起抗美援朝热潮的经验
    李大有·西学志·田原
    察南抗美援朝运动，已逐渐深入到农村各个角落。通过各种形式宣传，群众对目前形势的认识已初步明确，对美帝仇恨激增，并鼓起了保家卫国的决心，从而带动广大群众投入整个运动里来。怀来、万全、蔚县、阳原各地群众都纷纷以完成公粮，搞好冬季生产，来表示对中国人民援朝志愿部队的支持；青年们则志愿报名赴朝参战。察南全区五千五百万斤公粮任务不到二十天已全部入库。
    在农村中进行深入而普遍的抗美援朝宣传工作，是一个艰巨的思想发动与教育过程。农民在觉悟未提高前，对美帝认识模糊，不了解美帝一贯侵华罪行，看不清美帝凶恶残暴的面貌。但是经过各种宣传、教育、启发之后，开始认识到美帝的残暴，卑鄙与可恨，感到不能再忍受了，引起无限愤怒，积极以实际行动抗美援朝，农村空气顿时紧张起来。
    在察南主要是采取以下几种方式进行抗美援朝保家卫国宣传的。
    一、从各种组织内深入进行反美教育。各地农村支部、青年、妇女、民兵、学校、读报组等组织，均以座谈会方式揭发了美帝侵华暴行，说明美帝是纸老虎，引起群众对美帝的仇视、蔑视与鄙视，鼓起抗美援朝的热情。如万全县苏家桥妇女开过座谈会后，觉悟大大提高，当场保证作好秋征、卫生及生产工作，支援朝鲜人民。天镇东南街民兵座谈后，看透了美帝的凶险，除报名赴朝抗美外，还要保证作好后方治安工作，坚决镇压反革命分子。怀来辛庄子等地读报组读完报，听报的人经过座谈，一致仇视美帝，第二天即掀起缴粮热潮。
    二、发挥党、团员、干部、劳模代表的先锋作用，以他们为骨干，团结与发动群众，造成热火朝天的抗美援朝运动。涿鹿县孟家窑子村王琳是劳模又是党的支部书记。他积极团结教育全村农民，提高了大家的政治觉悟。现该村已有三十九名男女青年志愿赴朝抗美。怀安县瓦窑沟俞昌（全国农业劳模代表），在村中大力揭发美帝罪恶，全村公粮很快即全部入库。怀来县人民代表王桂兰从省开完会回村后，积极动员组织群众缴公粮，搞生产，到处讲说美帝罪行，掀起全村抗美援朝的热潮。
    三、利用一切形式，深入宣传，启发群众义愤。怀来干部、教员、学生组成十个宣传队，由城到乡，深入农村各个角落；广泛采用演剧、拉洋片、说大鼓书、漫画、话报等形式宣传美帝罪行，激起了群众对美帝的仇恨。当演剧演到美李罪行时，群众高呼：“打死他！打死他！”
    四、抓住一切机会进行宣传。万全、怀来等县都在整训班将美帝的罪行、美帝为什么是纸老虎等问题进行讲解和讨论。怀来整调班有十四个村党员干部当场报名志愿赴朝参战。各县粮库工作人员一般都利用农民缴粮机会，进行抗美援朝保家卫国宣传。察南专区养路段有群众二十余人等待出发修路，该段工作人员马上抓紧时机开了一个座谈会，使他们更清楚地认识了美帝的狰狞面目。
    五、与农民个别谈话或在座谈会上采用诉苦及回忆的形式，启发群众仇美情绪。天镇党训班党员任品回忆到家产被抢，老婆被霸占的情况时，痛恨不已，觉悟到这苦楚是美帝给的，立时要求赴朝抗美。尹文屯农民对比了过去的苦难日子和今天的幸福生活，坚决要保卫好光景，喊出了“缺了粮草我们有，拿起枪杆就是兵”的口号。
    六、乡村小学教员、学生、小知识分子在乡村宣传上作用很大，是农村宣传工作的主力军。他们不但能够长期坚持，且能深入到户，小学生更能回家作家庭宣传与座谈。怀来窑子头白秀英等小学生在村到处宣传美帝罪恶，老乡非常注意听。辛庄子小知识分子连科每天给老乡读报，对群众启发很大。
    七、乡艺开展，将大大加强时事的宣传工作。察南区开办的乡艺训练班开班的第一天即编出抗美援朝的快板，非常生动。到十二月训练完后，这一支生力军，回到乡村，将大大增强在乡村抗美援朝的宣传力量。
    八、宣传必须与实际行动相结合。经过宣传，群众对目前形势有了进一步的认识之后立即行动起来，是此次抗美援朝宣传的特点，如要求赴朝参战，积极缴纳公粮等行动。也只有通过实际行动表现，群众觉悟程度才能更加巩固与提高。
    九、结合抗美援朝运动，教育发动群众，揭发一切谣言，监视、检举、镇压特务分子、反动地主、富农、道、会门的破坏及其他反动行为。各地在宣传上一般都是抗美援朝与镇压反革命紧紧相结合。民兵、群众在思想上对此认识已进一步明确起来，因而抗美援朝在农村宣传上也减少了阻力。
    十、自上而下地明确与重视这一运动的开展与深入。每个干部均深入地进行了一系列的时事学习，掌握了丰富的宣传材料，克服了过去宣传时“没的说”或“说错了”的偏向。并提出“中心工作结合抗美援朝；为了抗美援朝，更要搞好中心工作”的口号。因而各地抗美援朝工作都是紧密地结合着中心工作进行，使中心工作内容丰富，使抗美援朝内容更深入与实际。?丝姑涝????要搞好中心工作”的口号。因而各地抗美援朝工作都是紧密地结合着中心工作进行，使中心工作内容丰富，使抗美援朝内容更深入与实际。
