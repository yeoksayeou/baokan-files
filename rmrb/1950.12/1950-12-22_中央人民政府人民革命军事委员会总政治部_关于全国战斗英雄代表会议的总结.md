Summary of the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives

Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou:

After the State Council's decision on July 21 to convene the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives and the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers was announced, the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued a special directive to the entire army on July 28 regarding the convening of this conference. It allocated the number of representatives that each major military region's subordinate units should produce. It stipulated three conditions for electing combat hero representatives: first, those who are resourceful and courageous in combat, possess special merits, and are representative of the entire army; second, those who possess excellent political qualities, have close ties with the masses, and have high prestige; and third, those who have special merits in staff work, political work, logistics, training,剿匪（bandit suppression), mass work, battlefield rescue, and other work. It also stipulated that the method for producing representatives should be to hold heroic model conferences at the military or provincial military district level for recommendation. These heroic model representatives should include the most typical figures from all branches of the military, with combat heroes as the main focus. After the directive was announced, leadership organs at all levels of the entire army and all commanders and fighters of the army conducted serious, intense, and enthusiastic preparations for the convening of the conference, and combined the selection of heroic models with education on new heroism and the continued development of the merit-making movement.

Before the meeting, a representative qualification review committee was established to conduct a careful review of the representatives recommended by each military region. The review results showed that the 350 combat heroes and militia hero representatives attending the conference were all selected through a carefully led, level-by-level process. They have made great contributions and brilliant achievements to the people and the motherland and fully meet the conditions stipulated by the General Political Department. Among the 350 official representatives, there were 258 combat heroes, 44 model workers, 5 representatives of model units, and 43 militia representatives, of which Communist Party members accounted for 95 percent. There were a total of 10 female representatives, including 2 female combat heroes, 2 female militia heroes, and the remaining 6 were model workers. Among the 307 army representatives, there were 83 cadres above the regimental and battalion level, 193 company and platoon cadres, and 31 below the squad level. 192 had participated in 50 or fewer battles, 47 had participated in more than 50 but less than 100 battles, and 30 had participated in more than 100 battles, including some who had participated in more than 250 battles. 172 had been wounded one to five times, 41 had been wounded six to ten times, and 6 had been wounded more than eleven times. In addition, 64 representatives from the uprising troops attended as observers.

The conference opened on September 25 and closed on October 2, lasting eight days. The opening and closing ceremonies, as well as listening to the reports of the leaders, were jointly held with the Model Worker Representatives Conference. Typical reports, summary reports, and awards were given separately. Due to time constraints, a total of 26 heroic model representatives spoke, and 3 model worker representatives attended the meeting to speak. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the democratic parties, and military and government organs and mass organizations across the country gave the conference warm congratulations and ardent hopes. The conference received a total of 132 congratulatory telegrams, more than 3,000 congratulatory letters, and various gifts. During the conference, 19 units presented flags and flowers to the conference. The representatives were greatly encouraged and respected. After the conference, at the request of various organs, organizations, schools, and suburban masses in Beijing, the representatives held nine discussion meetings and thirty-five lecture meetings, with 236 combat hero representatives and more than 74,630 listeners participating in these meetings, widely publicizing the new heroism and greatly enhancing the glorious position of the People's Army. After the conference, the representatives also visited Beijing's scenic spots and the air force.

The People's Liberation Army Battle Achievements Exhibition and Weapons Exhibition, held simultaneously with the conference, attracted 998,000 visitors (about 200,000 from other places) in 31 days from October 2 to November 1. The hero representatives all participated in the opening ceremony of the exhibition and the National Day military parade. The representatives were filled with boundless confidence in building a strong national defense force.

The conference was basically successful and very rewarding. The main manifestations are: the conference implemented the idea of defending the motherland and resisting American imperialist aggression; it enhanced the fighting will of the troops; and it powerfully promoted the building of a stronger national defense force and the development of the revolutionary heroism movement. The summary report of the conference specifically commended 33 outstanding heroic model figures, including various branches of the military, various field armies, and various types, and initially summarized the main experiences of the merit-making movement since the Liberation War. The deeds of the combat heroes were widely publicized through newspapers, broadcasts, and symposium reports, which educated the masses and the representatives themselves. Some representatives originally thought they were pretty good, but at the meeting, they "saw many heroes wearing full chests of medals, not enough space on the left side, so they wore them on the right side." After listening to other people's reports, they felt that they were still not as good as others, and said: "My little merit is nothing compared to others," expressing humility. Some representatives who had previously firmly requested to leave the army completely changed their minds at the meeting. After the meeting, he said: "The previous idea was wrong. If imperialism is not eliminated, we will always be a fighting force." The representatives of the uprising troops attending the meeting received the same treatment as the combat hero representatives, and they felt very ashamed. The five representatives of the Luo Guangwen Corps wrote a letter after the meeting expressing their gratitude to the higher authorities for giving them the honor of participating in the grand meeting, and expressed their determination to bring back what they had learned at the meeting, transform themselves, and transform the troops. After they returned to the troops and made a report, many comrades said: "The Communist Party cares for and encourages the uprising troops in this way, but we have made no contribution to the people. We are determined to join the People's Liberation Army and carry out the revolution to the end." After returning to the unit, the representative of the 21st Corps introduced to the troops with full confidence the great strength of the new China displayed at the National Day celebrations. Chen Yuanjun (observer representative of the 21st Corps) was deeply moved when a five or six-year-old child grabbed him in Beihai and said: "I want you to liberate Taiwan and beat the American imperialists into the sea." Sun Sheng, a representative of the Suiyuan uprising troops, said: "We wear the same clothes as the People's Liberation Army, but we are really far behind. I will go back and help the instructor well to transform our company to be the same as the Liberation Army." These reflections are actually the common feeling of all the representatives of the uprising troops attending the meeting. The representatives were warmly welcomed and entertained by Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and all circles in Beijing, and received the infinite love and respect of the people. They deeply experienced the supreme glory of the people's heroes and universally felt that participating in this meeting was "the pinnacle of glory." In the future, they must act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, play a backbone, leading, and bridge role in the cause of building a strong national defense army and in the struggle to defend the motherland and defend world peace, learn humbly, and further improve themselves.

Shortcomings of the meeting: At the beginning of the meeting, no attention was paid to commemorating the martyrs and sacrificed heroes and first praising their achievements (this was remedied at the closing ceremony). The time and procedure of the meeting were too tight, there was not enough small group discussion outside the general assembly, and many reports from the leaders did not have time to be discussed, which inevitably affected the depth of understanding and implementation of the spirit of the conference. When electing heroic models, attention was not paid to the universal selection of heroic model units to promote the collectivity and mass character of the heroic model movement.

After this meeting, we feel that in addition to continuing to deeply implement the ideological education that we are always a fighting force and the education of patriotism and internationalism in the troops, we would like to make the following suggestions to the Central People's Government:

1. In order to more widely carry out the new heroism movement in the troops, the Central People's Government should promulgate measures for awarding merit, so that heroic models with outstanding achievements can universally receive honorary commendations.

2. During the Liberation War, some heroic martyrs emerged who sacrificed themselves and died with the enemy in order to complete certain combat missions, such as Chen Jinhe and Zhang Shucai of the Third Field Army, and Liang Shiying, Dong Cunrui, and Xu Hanlin of the Fourth Field Army. Their selfless spirit of sacrifice is sufficient to be a model for the entire army. In order to commend this heroic behavior and use it to promote our army's fighting will, the government should be ordered to commend them and stipulate memorial methods. Necessary care should be given to the families of the martyrs.

3. The life of the honored servicemen is of constant concern to the soldiers in active service. Whether the resettlement and management of this group of people is properly done has a great relationship to the morale of the troops. Therefore, it is recommended that the government convene a conference of honored servicemen representatives in the major administrative regions this winter and spring to encourage the honored servicemen to work hard in production, abide by laws and regulations, and study and improve relevant work in this area, in order to comfort the honored servicemen and boost the morale of the troops.

    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部
    关于全国战斗英雄代表会议的总结毛主席、周总理：
    七月二十一日政务院关于召开全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的决定公布后，人民革命军事委员会总政治部特于七月二十八日向全军发布了关于召开这一会议的专门指示：分配了各大军区所属部队应产生的代表名额；规定了选举战斗英雄代表的三个条件，即第一、在战斗中智勇兼备，具有特殊功绩，并在全军有代表性者；第二、政治品质优秀、与群众有密切联系并有很高威望者；第三、在参谋、政治、后勤、练兵、剿匪、群众工作、战场救护等工作方面有特殊功绩者；还规定了代表产生的办法是以军或省军区为单位，召开英模大会进行推选，这些英雄模范代表，应包括各兵种最典型的人物，而以战斗英雄为主。指示公布后，全军各级领导机关及全军指战员，都曾为会议的召开进行了严肃、紧张、热烈的筹备工作，并结合英模评选，进行了新英雄主义的教育及继续开展立功运动。
    会前成立了代表资格审查委员会，对各军区所推选之代表进行了慎重的审查。审查结果，认为出席会议的三百五十名战斗英雄和民兵英雄代表，都是经过有领导地逐级慎重评选的，他们对人民、对祖国有伟大的贡献和辉煌的功绩，完全符合总政治部所规定的条件。三百五十名正式代表中，包括战斗英雄二百五十八人，工作模范四十四人，模范单位代表五人，民兵代表四十三人，其中共产党员占百分之九十五。女代表共十人，包括女战斗英雄、女民兵英雄各二人，其余六人为模范工作者。军队代表三百零七人中，计团营以上干部八十三人，连排干部一百九十三人，班以下三十一人。作战五十次以下者一百九十二人，五十次以上百次以下者四十七人，百次以上者三十人，其中尚有作战二百五十次以上者。负伤一至五次者一百七十二人，六至十次者四十一人，十一次以上者六人。另有起义部队代表六十四人列席。
    会议于九月二十五日开幕，十月二日闭幕，历时八日。开幕、闭幕典礼及听取首长报告是与劳模代表会议联合举行的。典型报告及总结发奖则是单独举行的。由于时间的限制，英模代表发言者共二十六人，并有劳模代表三人到会讲话。中共中央、各民主党派、全国各地军政机关、群众团体给了大会以热烈祝贺与殷切希望，大会共收到贺电一百三十二份，贺信三千余件及礼物多种。会议进行过程中，有十九个单位向大会献旗献花。代表们受到了极大的鼓舞与尊敬。会后，代表们应北京市各机关、团体、学校及市郊群众之请，举行了九个座谈会，三十五个讲演会，有二百三十六个战斗英雄代表和七万四千六百三十多听众参加了这些会议，广泛地宣扬了新英雄主义，大大提高了人民军队的光荣地位。会议结束后，代表们还参观了北京名胜及空军。
    与会议同时举行的人民解放军战绩展览会与兵器展览会，自十月二日至十一月一日，三十一天中观众达九十九万八千人（外埠来的约二十万人）。英雄代表都参加了展览会的揭幕典礼和国庆日的阅兵典礼，对于建设一支强大的国防力量，代表们充满了无限信心。
    会议基本上是成功的，是有很大收获的。主要的表现在：会议贯彻了保卫祖国、反抗美帝国主义侵略的思想；提高了部队的战斗意志；并为建设更强大的国防力量、展开革命英雄主义运动作了有力的推动。大会总结报告中，具体表扬了三十三个包括各兵种、各野战军、各类型的突出英模人物，并初步总结了解放战争以来立功运动的主要经验。并利用报纸广播座谈报告等广泛宣传了战斗英雄事迹，教育了群众，也教育了代表本身。有的代表原先自己以为很不错了，在会上“看见很多英雄，带着满胸脯子奖章，左面带不下，带在右面”。听了别人报告以后，更感到自己还是不如人家，说：“咱这点功叫别人一比就比得没有了”，表示虚心了。个别代表前曾坚决要求不干军队，会议完全改变了他的想法，会后他说：“以前的想法是不对的，帝国主义不消灭，我们永远是战斗队”。列席之起义部队代表与战斗英雄代表的待遇一样，他们觉得很惭愧。罗广文兵团的五个代表会后写信表示感谢上级给予他们参加盛会的光荣，并表示决心把在大会上学来的东西带回去，改造自己，改造部队。当他们回到部队做了传达报告以后，很多同志说：“共产党对起义部队这样关心和鼓励，而我们对人民却没有一点贡献，我们决心参加解放军革命到底”。二十一兵团的代表回去以后，满怀信心的向部队介绍了在国庆盛典上所显示的新中国的伟大力量，陈远君（二十一兵团列席代表）在北海参观时，一个五六岁的孩子拉住他说：“我要你们解放台湾，把美帝国主义打到海里”，新中国儿童的政治觉悟给他以极大的感动。绥远起义部队代表孙胜说：“我们穿的和人民解放军一样，可是实在还差得很远，我回去要好好帮助指导员，把我们的连队改造的和解放军一样”。这些反映，实际上是所有起义部队列席代表的共同感觉。代表们受到毛主席及中央人民政府和北京市各界的隆重欢迎与招待，又受到人民无限的热爱与尊敬，深切体验到人民英雄的无上荣耀，普遍感到参加这次会议“光荣到了顶点”，今后一定按照毛主席的指示，在建设强大国防军的事业上，在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的斗争中，要起到骨干、带头、桥梁作用，虚心学习，更加提高自己。
    会议的缺点：会议之初，没有注意到对烈士及牺牲英雄的追念及首先表扬他们的功绩（已经在闭幕典礼上作了补救）。会议的时间和程序太紧，大会之外小组讨论不够，首长们的许多报告，没有来得及讨论，对于领会和贯彻大会精神的深度上不能不受到一些影响。在选举英模时，未注意普遍评选英模单位，以提倡英模运动的集体性和群众性。
    经过这次会议，我们觉得除在部队中继续深入地贯彻永远是战斗队的思想教育和爱国主义、国际主义的教育外，愿向中央人民政府提出下面几个建议：
    一、为了在部队中更广泛地开展新英雄主义运动，中央人民政府应颁布立功奖励办法，使功勋卓著的英雄模范能普遍得到荣誉的褒奖。
    二、在解放战争中曾出现了一些为完成某项战斗任务而舍身与敌同归于尽的英雄烈士，如三野的陈金合、张树才，四野之梁士英、董存瑞、徐汉林等，他们忘我的牺牲精神，足为全军模范，为了表彰此种壮烈行为，并借以发扬我军战斗意志，应请政府明令褒奖，并规定纪念办法。对烈士家属则给以必要的照顾。
    三、荣誉军人的生活是在役军人所经常关心的，对这部分人员安置及管理的妥善与否，对部队士气有很大关系，故建议政府于今冬明春以大行政区为单位，召开一次荣誉军人代表会议，鼓励荣军努力生产，遵守法令并研究改进有关这方面的工作，以安慰荣军情绪及鼓舞部队士气。
