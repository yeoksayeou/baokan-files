Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The "Truth Daily" published a Korean dispatch by Kornilov on the 27th from Moscow, reporting on the brilliant achievements of the young Korean Air Force and the excellent skills of its pilots, stating: When the American invading army in Korea gained temporary victories, they repeatedly boasted that the Korean People's Air Force had been wiped out. Now, the command of the American invading army can only sing a different tune. In fact, "Flying Fortress" bombers and "Mustang" fighters are being shot down and destroyed on the ground by Korean pilots more and more frequently. A few days ago, Korean pilots Jiang Chuanhan and Qi Dongxue (transliteration) sank an enemy destroyer near Nampo on the Yellow Sea. Pilot Quan Xingu (transliteration) destroyed approximately forty trucks loaded with ammunition on a highway near Seoul.

The reporter wrote: Not long ago, we visited an airfield in northern Korea and witnessed the combat skills and heroism of the Korean pilots. When Captain Jin Dawon (transliteration) was introducing many pilots to us and telling us about their combat lives, a battle interrupted our conversation.

American bombers, covered by jet fighters, approached the airfield, and an aerial battle ensued with Korean fighters. After the second attack by the Korean fighters, an American "Flying Fortress" caught fire, crashed to the ground, and burned. A few minutes later, two more B-26 bombers caught fire and crashed. Although the American bandits dropped bombs, they did not hit their targets. Under the pursuit of the Korean fighters, the American planes fled the airfield at maximum speed in a panic.

In the evening, Air Force Captain Jin Dawon analyzed the results of the aerial battle, saying that a total of one "Flying Fortress," five B-26 bombers, and one jet fighter were shot down that day. He analyzed the combat of each pilot in detail, emphasizing their bravery and excellent training. While analyzing this aerial battle, a group of airmen from the Korean People's Air Force night bomber squadron were preparing to take off. They were heading out to bomb the airfields of Seoul and Suwon, and to attack American transport ships and warships in the naval base on the east coast of Korea. These ships were loading the remnants of the defeated American and British interventionists, who were fleeing these bases in haste and confusion.

The dispatch concluded: In the victorious offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the young airmen of the Korean Air Force—the heroes of the Korean people—provided strong support.

    真理报驻朝鲜记者报道
    朝鲜人民空军战绩辉煌
    美国飞机被击落的事情越来越多了
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》于二十七日发表科尔尼洛夫的朝鲜通讯，报道朝鲜年轻空军的辉煌战绩和飞行员的优秀技术称：当美国在朝鲜的侵略军得到暂时胜利的时候，他们一再吹嘘朝鲜人民的空军已被消灭。现在，美国侵略军的指挥部却只能唱出另一种调子。事实上；“飞行堡垒”轰炸机和“野马式”战斗机被朝鲜飞行员击落而摔毁在地上的事情越来越多了。几天前，朝鲜飞行员江川汉和齐东雪（译音）在黄海海面南浦附近击沉了敌驱逐舰一艘。飞行员全信久（译音）在汉城附近的公路上，击毁了约四十辆满载弹药的卡车。
    记者写道：不久前，我们曾访问朝鲜北部的一个机场，目睹了朝鲜飞行员的战斗技术和英雄气概。当队长金大元（译音）给我们介绍许多飞行员，并把他们的战斗生活告诉我们的时候，一场战斗打断了我们的谈话。
    在喷气式战斗机掩护下的美国轰炸机飞近机场，与朝鲜战斗机发生了空战。在朝鲜战斗机第二次攻击后，就有一架美国的“飞行堡垒”着火，坠地焚毁。几分钟之后，又有两架Ｂ二十六型轰炸机着火坠地。美国强盗虽然投下了炸弹，但并没有命中目标。在朝鲜战斗机的追击下，美国飞机慌忙以最大的速度逃离了机场。
    傍晚，空军队队长金大元分析空战结果时说，那天一共击落了一架“飞行堡垒”、五架Ｂ二十六型轰炸机和一架喷气式战斗机。他详细分析了每一个驾驶员的战斗，并着重指出他们的英勇和优良的训练。正在分析这次空战的时候，朝鲜人民空军夜间轰炸机队的一群空军人员们准备起飞。他们是出发去轰炸汉城和水原的机场，袭击朝鲜东海岸海军基地的美国运输船只和军舰，这些舰只正在装载美英干涉者败军的残余，慌忙和混乱地逃离这些基地。
    通讯在结语中说：在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的胜利进攻中，朝鲜年轻的空军人员——朝鲜人民的英雄们，作了有力的支援。
