    Great Friendship! Great Support!
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting in Korea, is receiving a warm welcome and love from the Korean people.
    The news of the victories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side-by-side boosts the Korean people's confidence in victory. The news of recovered territories and the numbers of enemies eliminated evokes unparalleled joy. How exciting!
    People are actively supporting the fighting troops with heartfelt joy!
    At night, along hundreds of kilometers of highways in the mountainous areas, thousands upon thousands of people are repairing the roads, their pickaxes and hoes striking sparks against the stones. Among the crowds are elderly elders, women, and students. To ensure that the troops and artillery advancing on the enemy can move swiftly to the front, they brave the severe cold, filling in the uneven ground on the roads on the high mountains with each shovel and hoe!
    During the troops' march, slogans painted in white lime on the mountain walls and pasted on the walls can be seen everywhere: "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" "Long Live Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Friendship and Unity between the Chinese and Korean Nations!"... These slogans signify their love for the leader of the Chinese people and their welcome to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. When the troops pass through villages and towns, even in the dead of night, as soon as people hear that it is the People's Volunteer Army passing through, buckets and basins filled with hot water are brought before the soldiers. Although the language may sometimes be a barrier, it is not difficult to see from their expressions that they are saying: "It's cold! Comrades, drink some water to warm yourselves up!" When the comrades refuse the food they have prepared, they are genuinely unhappy, even though every grain of rice is precious here. After repeated explanations, and upon seeing the troops setting up their field kitchens to cook, they are initially surprised, then their faces fill with gratitude.
    When the troops need to bivouac, people try their best to make the houses warm. The soldiers sleep warmly and comfortably, and the hosts often leave contentedly only after ensuring that the soldiers are asleep. Sometimes enemy air raids are severe, and the houses cannot be used, so the soldiers have to bivouac in mountain caves. Even there, they try their best to spread grass for them to lie on. The soldiers receive warm care and attention, and people strive to ensure the troops' safety. Once, enemy aircraft dropped several bombs next to a bivouac of soldiers, collapsing the houses. Fortunately, only one soldier suffered a minor graze. However, the local Labor Party organization immediately sent people to express their condolences and inquire whether the troops had suffered any losses.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army strictly adheres to the discipline of not taking a single blade of grass or tree from the people, deeply moving the Korean people. Once, a unit entered a village, and the people all went into the mountain gullies to avoid the planes before dawn. Although the troops suffered a night of cold, they still endured their fatigue and slept under the eaves of the people's houses and on the haystacks. Not a single comrade stepped foot inside the people's houses. The people returned from the mountains and were deeply moved to see the troops sleeping outside. In the troop concentration areas, the relationship between the army and the people is even more harmonious and seamless. Whenever the troops have free time, they help the masses with their work. The soldiers learn to carry water on their heads, causing the children to laugh. The courtyards where the troops live are all kept clean. Many Korean young people have joined the army, and the soldiers are mostly from peasant backgrounds, so they always do their best to work. The firewood used by the troops here is all gathered by themselves on the mountains, and the grain, oil, salt, and vegetables they eat are brought by themselves. Sometimes, the people send their own pickled vegetables, and the soldiers hide them, then send them back after finishing their meals, leaving the people simply helpless towards this army. Once, a comrade from a certain unit was washing clothes when an old woman from the people's family saw him. This was her chance, and the old woman insisted on washing them for him. Two teenage girls picked up the basin and ran off, returning with the clothes washed spotlessly clean. When our comrade thanked the old woman, she said affectionately, "It is right to wash clothes for our own army, there is no need to thank me!" That night, this comrade accidentally broke the old woman's kerosene lamp. Our comrade took out money to compensate her, but the old woman refused to take it no matter what, forcing our comrade to secretly put it in her pocket while she was asleep.
    When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army meet, the two people's armies, like friends who have not seen each other for a long time, stick together, giving each other thumbs up for their bravery and skill in battle. Korean People's Army soldiers on guard along the way salute the passing Chinese People's Volunteer Army with their rifles. In many places, the Korean People's Army takes over the guard duties for the exhausted Chinese People's Volunteer Army, so that the Volunteer Army can get full rest.
    The warm support of the Korean people warms the hearts of the soldiers and deeply moves them. In Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sees the peaceful cities and villages burned to ashes by the American air robbers, the factories and mines with their production equipment destroyed, and also the bloody corpses and the homeless people with thin clothes and no place to live. The expressions on the faces of the heroes are icy, but their hearts are filled with hatred. I see them advancing powerfully, advancing towards the enemy!

### 伟大的友谊！伟大的支援！

    伟大的友谊！伟大的支援！
    在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军，受到朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎和爱戴。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的捷音，鼓舞着朝鲜人民胜利的信心，收复了的土地和消灭敌人数目的消息，激起了无比的欢欣，多么令人兴奋呢！
    人们以欣慰的心情，积极地支援着作战部队！
    夜里，山区中绵亘数百公里长的公路沿线上，成千上万的人们在整修着，锹镐碰着石头冒着火星。人群中有年老的长者、妇女和学生，为了使进击敌人的部队、大炮迅速地开向前方，他们冒着严寒，在高山上一锹一镐地填着路上凹凸不平地带！
    部队行进中，到处可以看到用白石灰刷在山壁上的和墙壁上贴着的标语：“万岁！中华人民共和国”“万岁！毛泽东！”“中朝民族友谊团结万岁！”……口号标志着对中国人民领袖的热爱和对中国人民志愿军的欢迎。部队路过村镇时，虽然是在深夜里，只要人们听到是人民志愿军在通过，装满了热水的桶、盆都抬在战士们的面前，言语有时虽不通，但亦不难从表情看出是在说：“天冷啊！同志喝点水暖和暖和吧！”当他们准备的食物被同志们拒绝时，的确他们真不痛快，虽然在这里的粮食一粒也是很珍贵的。经过再三解释，和看见部队支起行军锅在煮饭时，他们起初是惊异，后来是满面的感激表情。
    部队要宿营，人们尽量把屋子烧得暖暖的，战士们睡着又暖又舒服，主人时常是照料战士们睡着之后才满意地走开。有时敌人空袭厉害，屋子不能住，战士们要在山洞内宿营，即或在这里也尽量地铺上草。战士们受到热情地关心和照顾，人们力求部队安全无事。有一次，敌人的飞机在某部战士们宿营地旁边投下几颗炸弹，房子震塌，幸好部队仅有一个战士擦伤了一点，但是当地劳动党的组织马上派人来慰问，关心部队是否受到损失。
    中国人民志愿军恪守着不动人民一草一木的秋毫无犯的军纪，深深地感动着朝鲜人民。一次，部队走进了一个村庄，人们在黎明前全部进山沟躲飞机。部队虽然受了一夜冻，但仍忍受疲乏，睡在老百姓的屋檐下和草垛上，没有一个同志涉足走进老百姓的屋子。老百姓从山上回来看见部队睡在外面，十分感动。在部队集结驻地，军民关系更是表现融洽无间。部队一闲下就帮助群众干活。战士学着用头顶水，引起孩子们的好笑。部队住的院子都是干干净净的。朝鲜青年人多去参军了，战士们多是庄稼汉出身，总是尽其所能的劳动着。部队在这里的烧柴都是自己上山打，吃的粮、油、盐、菜是自己带的。有时老百姓送来自己腌的咸菜，战士们都藏起来，吃完了饭再送回去，闹的老百姓对这支队伍简直是没办法。有一次某部一个同志正在洗衣服，给老百姓家的一位老太太看见了，这一下找着机会了，老太太非要给洗不可，两个十几岁的小姑娘端起盆就跑，回来时，盆子里已经是洗得干干净净的衣服。当我们的同志向老太太致谢时，老太太亲近地说：“给自己军队洗点衣服是应该的，用不到谢！”当天夜里这个同志不小心把老太太的煤油灯打坏，我们同志掏出钱来要赔偿，老太太说啥也不要，逼的我们这个同志没办法，在老太太睡着时偷偷地放在她的衣兜内。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军遇见时，两支人民部队，像久不相遇的朋友一样，粘在一起，互相为彼此的英勇善战伸着大姆指。沿途岗哨上的朝鲜人民军都向行进着的中国人民志愿军举枪敬礼。在很多地方，朝鲜人民军为走得疲乏的中国人民志愿军担任警戒，以便使志愿军得到充分休息。
    朝鲜人民的热情支援，温暖着战士们的心，而深深地感动着。在朝鲜，中国人民志愿军一路上看到在美国空中强盗的凶手下，燃烧成灰烬的和平城市和乡村，生产设备被毁的工厂和矿山，也看到了血肉模糊的尸体，和衣履单薄而丧失了居室无家可归的人们，英雄们的面部表情是冰冷的，但内心却充满了仇恨。我看到他们有力地向前挺进，向敌人挺进着！十一月二十五日夜
