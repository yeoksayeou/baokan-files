    Pyongyang, the base of the Korean people's democratic construction for the past five years, is recovering from its wounds, and the heroic people are resolutely starting a new life. Residents are flocking back from all directions. The number of open stores is increasing day by day. The Liberation Tower standing on Moranbong Hill stands proudly. In the early morning, the sun shines on the entire city. On the City People's Committee building in the city center, the solemn and brilliant national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flutters in the wind. The citizens of Pyongyang have taken out the national flag of the Republic and the portrait of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, which they had treasured in cellars for forty-eight days, and hung them up again. On the main streets, groups of citizens gather around loudspeakers, listening to the radio broadcast of General Kim Il-sung's message to the people. The people of Pyongyang, who have escaped suffering and see the light of day again, are assisting their own government organs, the City People's Committee, in restoring democratic order, braving the danger of enemy aircraft bombing and shelling, and repairing the roads, bridges, and public facilities destroyed by the enemy.
    When the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers approached Pyongyang, the fleeing American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit army, lost their humanity and carried out large-scale destruction of Pyongyang. They set fire to Pyongyang's industrial areas, theaters, cultural institutions, and a large number of civilian houses and water and electricity facilities with large quantities of gasoline and gunpowder. On December 5, the last retreating group of bandits forced tens of thousands of citizens to the Daedong River with bayonets. After driving the young women walking in front across the river, the bandits blew up the river bridge and simultaneously strafed the men, elderly people, and children remaining on the west bank with machine guns. More than 10,000 people were massacred.
    At noon on December 6, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Pyongyang. The surviving citizens of Pyongyang, seeing their own army return, felt as if they were reunited with their relatives, shedding tears of joy and vying to accuse the American and Rhee bandit army of their heinous crimes, demanding revenge for them. Our Chinese People's Volunteers were warmly welcomed and comforted by the people everywhere. In the absence of a common language, the citizens expressed their love and respect through cordial handshakes and thumbs-up.

    平壤在恢复中
    朝鲜人民五年来民主建设的基地——平壤市，正在从创伤中恢复过来，英勇的人民正坚毅地开始新的生活。居民正络绎不绝地从四面八方搬回来。开门的商店一天比一天多起来。矗立在牡丹峰上的解放塔傲然屹立。清晨，阳光照耀着全市。在市中心区市人民委员会的大楼上，庄严灿烂的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗迎风飘扬。平壤市民们已把他们珍藏了四十八天的共和国国旗和朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的画像，重新从地窖中取出悬挂起来了。在通衢大道上，一堆一堆的市民聚集在扩音器的周围，倾听着电台广播金日成将军的告人民书。脱离了苦难重见天日的平壤市人民，正协助自己的政权机关——市人民委员会，恢复民主秩序，冒着敌机炸射的危险，抢修着被敌人破坏了的道路、桥梁与公用设施。
    当朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军逼近平壤的时候，仓皇逃跑的美国侵略者与李承晚匪军，丧失了人性，对平壤市进行了大规模的破坏。他们以大量汽油和火药把平壤的工业区、剧场、文化机关以及大批民房和水电设备等，付诸一炬。十二月五日，最后退却的一批匪军用刺刀押赶着数万市民到了大同江。匪徒们在把走在先头的青年妇女赶过江后，就炸毁了江桥，同时以机枪扫射留在西岸的男子、老年人和儿童。被屠杀者在一万人以上。
    十二月六日中午，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军进入平壤市。劫后余生的平壤市民，见到自己的军队回来，就象和亲人团圆一样，流着热泪，争相控诉美李匪军的万恶罪行，要求为他们报仇。我中国人民志愿军到处受到人民的热烈欢迎和慰问。在语言不通的情况下，市民们就以亲切的握手和翘起大拇指，来表示他们的敬爱感情。
