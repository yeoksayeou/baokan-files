    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The Labor Daily published on the 9th an article commenting on the Korean War, detailing the entire process of the American invaders' failure from offensive to retreat. The article said: The American "offensive," "personally commanded by MacArthur," on the entire 120-kilometer front, was specifically timed to coincide with the arrival of the delegation of the People's Republic of China in New York. According to Washington's plan, the "general offensive" must rapidly occupy all of North Korea, while creating a threat of invading China. The article described the failure of MacArthur's offensive and the victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' counter-offensive, saying: The invaders have suffered heavy losses and are continuing to retreat south. The remnants of the Eighth Army that escaped from Pyongyang are in a serious situation.
    The Komsomolskaya Pravda's international commentary on the 9th said: The robber army's advance in Korea has ended. The indomitable Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army have inflicted heavy losses on the invaders. The commentary pointed out: Truman's statement on November 30 attempted to intimidate the people of Korea and China and other countries, and to weaken their will to resist aggression. But the people cannot be intimidated. They know the seriousness and instability of the current international situation and have already taken on the task of combating the schemes of the reactionaries and defending peace.
    The Moscow Pravda on the 9th published an interview with Guo Moruo, who is currently staying in Moscow, by the newspaper's reporter. Guo Moruo discussed a series of issues, including the great achievements of Warsaw and the construction work of the free Chinese people, and the Chinese people's struggle to defend peace and oppose American aggressors. Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people rightly believe that the American aggression against Korea and the piratical occupation of Taiwan are a threat to all mankind and to world peace. At this stage, crushing American aggression in Asia means defending peace and preventing the possibility of a new world war. The Chinese people will do everything possible and take all effective measures to achieve this goal. Truman's war statement cannot intimidate the Chinese people. We fully recognize that American imperialism is an aggressor covered in blood and is a "paper tiger." The situation in Korea clearly proves this, where the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army are victoriously defeating the invading army. Guo Moruo further pointed out: The Soviet people and the Chinese people are great forces. Their fraternal unity can influence the whole world. Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong pointed this out long ago. This is why we must strengthen the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance. Guo Moruo finally stated: The Soviet Union and the great Stalin's leading position in the struggle to defend peace is the best guarantee of world peace.

    苏联劳动报及共青真理报
    评述美帝侵朝失败局势
    郭沫若对真理报记者谈：在现阶段粉碎美国在亚洲的侵略就意味着阻止发生新世界战争的可能。                                                  
    【新华社莫斯科十日电】九日出版的劳动报刊载一篇论述朝鲜战争的评论，详尽地叙述了美国侵略者从进攻到退却的整个失败过程。该文说：由“麦克阿瑟亲自指挥”，在整个一百二十公里长的战线上进行的美国“攻势”，是特别选定在中华人民共和国的代表团到达纽约的时候发动的。根据华盛顿的计划，“总攻势”必须迅速占领全部北朝鲜，同时造成入侵中国的威胁。该文叙述了麦克阿瑟攻势的失败以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军反攻的胜利之后说：侵略者受到了重大的损失，正在继续向南退却。从平壤逃出的第八军残部处在严重的情况中。
    共青真理报九日的国际评论说：强盗军在朝鲜境内的推进已经终止了。不屈服的朝鲜人民军，和中国志愿部队，使侵略者遭受到了严重的损失。评论指出：杜鲁门在十一月三十日的声明妄图吓住朝中人民和其他国家的人民，削弱他们反侵略的意志。但是人民是吓不倒的。他们晓得目前国际形势的严重和不安，并且已经担起打击反动派阴谋伎俩与保卫和平的任务。
    九日的莫斯科真理报刊载了现在逗留莫斯科的郭沫若对该报记者的谈话。郭沫若谈述了一连串的问题，包括华沙和大的成就，自由中国人民的建设工作，中国人民保卫和平反对美国侵略者的斗争等。郭沫若说：中国人民正确地认为美国对于朝鲜的侵略和对于台湾的强盗式的占领，是对于整个人类的威胁，对于全世界和平的威胁。在现阶段上粉碎美国在亚洲的侵略就意味着保卫和平与阻止发生新世界战争的可能。中国人民尽其所能，采取一切有效的办法来达到这个目的。杜鲁门的战争声明吓不住中国人民。我们完全认识美帝国主义是满身血污的侵略者，并且是一个“纸老虎”。朝鲜形势清楚地证明了这一点，在那里朝鲜人民军和中国志愿部队正在胜利地打垮侵略军。郭沫若进而指出：苏联人民和中国人民是伟大的力量。他们兄弟般地团结起来就能够影响整个世界。许久以前斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席就已经指出这个道理了。这就是我们为什么必须加强中苏友好同盟的道理。郭沫若最后称：苏联和伟大的斯大林在保卫和平斗争中的领导地位，是全世界和平的最好的保证。
