    The Great Stalin Constitution

    On December 5, 1936, the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union adopted the new Soviet Constitution, consolidating the achievements of the Soviet people since the October Revolution through legislative procedures. To commemorate Stalin, the creator of the constitution, the Soviet people called it the Stalin Constitution. Today, Stalin Constitution Day is not only a great festival for all nationalities in the Soviet Union, but also a memorial day of great historical significance for the working people of the world.

    The Stalin Constitution is the most democratic constitution in the world. The democracy of the Soviet Constitution, as Stalin said, "is not the 'usual' or 'generally accepted' democracy, but socialist democracy." According to Article 3 of the Constitution, "All power in the USSR belongs to the working people of town and country," and the Soviets of Working People's Deputies constitute the political foundation of the USSR. The transgressive nature of Soviet democracy is clearly manifested in the elections of the Soviet power organs, namely the Soviets. Taking the 1946 election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union, as an example: 101,450,936 people participated in the voting, accounting for 99.7 percent of all voters. A total of 1,339 representatives were elected, including 511 workers and 349 farmers. However, the situation in capitalist "democratic" countries is completely different. Even the most democratic "democracy" in capitalist countries is merely democracy within the bourgeoisie. The broad masses of working people cannot enjoy true democracy; what they can enjoy is only the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over them. For example, the United States has more than 50 kinds of restrictions on elections. Thirteen states stipulate that people receiving state subsidies, i.e., unemployed workers, do not have the right to vote, 29 states restrict soldiers and sailors from voting, and 19 states stipulate educational level and other restrictions. Industrial workers, who account for half of American voters, do not have a single representative in Congress, and tens of thousands of black people are deprived of their right to vote.

    The Stalin Constitution guarantees the Soviet people rights that no capitalist country has or can possibly have. The Constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Soviet Union enjoy the right to work, guaranteeing them to obtain work and be remunerated according to the quality of their labor. In contrast to the constant threat of unemployment and starvation faced by working people in capitalist countries, socialist Soviet Union has witnessed rapid increases in the number of workers due to the rapid advancement of construction. Between 1946 and 1949, 8 million employees were added to various sectors of the Soviet national economy, and in the third quarter of this year, the number of employees increased by 2.4 million compared with the same quarter last year.

    The Stalin Constitution stipulates that Soviet citizens have the right to material security in old age, in the event of sickness or loss of working capacity. Employees who reach a certain age can receive lifetime pensions, and they and their families can enjoy free medical care. But in the capitalist world, 50 countries do not have insurance for loss of working capacity, 49 countries do not have sickness insurance, and 41 countries do not have old-age insurance. In some countries, insurance premiums are paid for by deductions from workers' meager wages.

    The Stalin Constitution guarantees Soviet citizens the right to rest and leisure. Soviet workers have annual paid vacations. The government has built many sanatoriums and resorts for the working people. In the third quarter of 1950 alone, 15 million employees received full-paid vacations and vacationed in sanatoriums and resorts.

    The Stalin Constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Soviet Union have the right to education. The Soviet people receive universal primary compulsory education or seven years of free education, etc. Before the October Revolution, there were only 91 institutions of higher learning in the country. In 1949, there were more than 800 institutions of higher learning in the country, with more than 1.2 million students studying in these institutions of higher learning, exceeding the total number of higher education students in all European countries. Now there are 37 million students in primary schools, middle schools, technical schools and secondary specialized schools in the Soviet Union. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated in the Soviet Union. The expenditure on education in this year's budget reached 59.5 billion rubles, accounting for 14 percent of the total budget expenditure. In contrast, one-seventh of the population of the United States is illiterate, and the appropriation for education in the 1950-1951 budget is less than 1 percent of the total expenditure.

    According to the provisions of the Stalin Constitution, Soviet citizens enjoy political rights such as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and demonstration. It is particularly important that the Constitution guarantees Soviet citizens the material conditions necessary for exercising these freedoms, such as free use of venues for holding meetings, use of printing plants and paper for printing newspapers, and use of radio for broadcasting speeches, etc. As a result, the Soviet people have rapidly and universally improved their political level and are politically united like one person. However, the so-called freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association stipulated in the constitutions of all capitalist countries has become a hypocritical and ugly thing because the working people are deprived of the material conditions for exercising these freedoms. Moreover, even this formal freedom is now being increasingly and universally openly deprived.

    The Stalin Constitution guarantees women equal rights in political, economic and social life. There are 280 women representatives in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, accounting for more than 21 percent of all representatives. A total of 500,000 women across the Soviet Union have been elected to urban and rural Soviets. More than 300 female scientists, artists and labor heroes have been awarded the Stalin Prize. Hundreds of thousands of women have been promoted to leadership positions in collective farms. The Stalin Constitution guarantees the equal rights of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. All nationalities in the country have achieved tremendous economic and cultural development. All this does not exist and is impossible in any capitalist country.

    The Stalin Constitution is a summary of the victorious path experienced by the Soviet people. The Stalin Constitution illuminates the road for the working people of the world to get rid of enslavement and move towards a happy future, making them fully believe that what has been achieved in the Soviet Union can also be fully realized in other countries.

### 伟大的斯大林宪法

    伟大的斯大林宪法
    一九三六年十二月五日，苏联苏维埃第八届非常代表大会通过了苏联新宪法，用立法的手续巩固了十月革命以来苏联人民所获得的成就。苏联人民为了纪念宪法的缔造者斯大林，便把它称为斯大林宪法。今天，斯大林宪法日不仅是苏联各族人民的伟大节日，而且也是全世界劳动人民有伟大历史意义的纪念日。
    斯大林宪法是全世界最民主的宪法。苏联宪法的民主主义，正如斯大林所说：“并不是一般‘通常的’、‘公认的’民主主义，而是社会主义的民主主义”。按照宪法第三条的规定，“苏联全部政权属于城乡劳动人民”，构成苏联政治基础的是劳动人民代表苏维埃。苏联民主的侵越性明显地表现在苏联权力机关即苏维埃的选举上。以一九四六年苏联国家最高权力机关，即苏联最高苏维埃的选举为例：参加投票者计一亿零一百四十五万零九百三十六人，占全体选民的百分之九十九·七。选出的代表计一千三百三十九人，其中工人五百十一人，农民三百四十九人。但是，资本主义的“民主”国家的情形则完全不同。即使是最民主的资本主义国家的“民主”，也仅仅是资产阶级一个阶级内部的民主。广大的劳动人民是享受不到真正的民主的，他们所能享受的，只是资产阶级对他们的专政。例如美国对于选举的限制达五十余种之多，有十三州规定领取国家津贴的人即失业工人没有投票权，有二十九州限制士兵与水兵投票，有十九州规定了教育程度及其他种种限制。占美国选民半数的产业工人在国会中没有一名代表，成千成万的黑人被剥夺了选举权。
    斯大林宪法给苏联人民保证了任何资本主义国家所没有而且也不可能有的权利。宪法规定了苏联全体公民都享有劳动权，保证他们取得工作并按劳动的质量取酬。与资本主义国家劳动人民经常受失业与铠饿的威胁相反，社会主义的苏联由于建设工作的突飞猛进，劳动者不断地迅速增加。在一九四六至一九四九年间，苏联国民经济各部门增加了八百万职工，今年第三季职工人数又较去年同季增加了二百四十万人。
    斯大林宪法规定苏联公民在年老、疾病和丧失工作能力时，享有生活上的物质保障权。职工达到一定年龄便可领取终身养老金，他们和他们的家属可以免费享受医疗。但在资本主义世界里，五十个国家没有丧失劳动能力的保险，四十九个国家没有疾病保险，四十一个国家没有年老保险。有些国家的保险费，则是由工人征薄的工资支付的。
    斯大林宪法保障了苏联公民享有休息权。苏联工人每年有照发原薪的假期。政府为劳动人民建设了许多休养处所，仅在一九五○年第三季就有一千五百万职工获得全薪的假期，在疗养院和休养地度假。
    斯大林宪法规定苏联全体公民享有受教育的权利，苏联人民受到普遍初级义务教育或七年制的免费教育等。十月革命前，全国只有九十一所高等学校，一九四九年中全国有了八百余所高等学校，有一百二十余万的学生在这些高等学校念书，超过了欧洲一切国家高等学校学生人数的总和。现在苏联有三千七百万学生在小学、中学、技术学校及中等专门学校中学习。苏联全国已基本肃清文盲。今年预算中用于教育方面的费用达五百九十五亿卢布，占预算总支出的百分之十四。而美国有七分之一的人口是文盲，一九五○——一九五一年度预算中的教育拨款还不到总支出的百分之一。
    按照斯大林宪法的规定，苏联公民享有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行示威等政治权利。特别重要的是宪法保障苏联公民为行使这些自由所必需的物质条件，如自由使用会场举行集会，使用印刷厂和纸张刊印书报，使用无线电作广播演说等等。由于如此苏联人民已迅速普遍地提高了政治水平，在政治上巩固团结得象一个人一样。而一切资本主义国家宪法所规定的所谓言论、出版、集会、结社自由，因为劳动人民被剥夺了行使这些自由的物质条件，而成了虚伪的丑陋的东西。而且即使是这种形式上的自由，现在也日益普遍地被公开加以剥夺。
    斯大林宪法保证了妇女在政治、经济、与社会生活上的平等权利。苏联最高苏维埃中有妇女代表二百八十名，占全体代表百分之二十一强。苏联全国共有五十万妇女被选入城乡苏维埃。有三百多位女科学家、艺术家和劳动英雄荣获了斯大林奖金。数十万妇女已提升到集体农场的领导地位上。斯大林宪法保证了苏联各民族的平等权利。国内一切民族均已在经济与文化上获得了巨大的发展。这一切，在任何资本主义国家都是没有的，而且是不可能有的。
    斯大林宪法是苏联人民经历的胜利道路的总结。斯大林宪法给全世界劳动人民照亮了摆脱奴役、走向幸福未来的大道，使他们充分相信在苏联已经实现了的事情，也完全能够在其他国家实现。
