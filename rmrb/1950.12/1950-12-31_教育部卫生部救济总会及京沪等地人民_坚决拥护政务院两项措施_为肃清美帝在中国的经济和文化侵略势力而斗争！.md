The Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Relief Administration, and the people of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places are resolutely supporting the two measures of the Government Administration Council and are fighting to eliminate the economic and cultural aggression forces of American imperialism!
On December 28th, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an order deciding that local people's governments should control and investigate all properties of the U.S. government and U.S. enterprises within our country and freeze all public and private U.S. deposits in all banks within our country. On the 29th, the Government Administration Council also passed a decision on the policy of handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups that accept U.S. subsidies. These two measures are an effective counterattack against the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism against our country. After the orders and reports and decisions concerning these two measures were announced, they were immediately warmly supported by all patriotic people. Minister Ma Xulun of the Ministry of Education, Minister Li Dequan of the Ministry of Health, and Chairman Soong Ching Ling of the People's Relief Administration all issued talks and statements, respectively expressing their determination to implement the orders and decisions of the Government Administration Council. People in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, including many personnel from cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious groups that accept U.S. subsidies, have expressed their firm support for these two measures of the Government Administration Council. The opinions expressed by all parties are published below:

Minister of Education
Ma Xulun Delivers a Speech
【Xinhua News Agency, December 30th】 Minister Ma Xulun of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government delivered the following speech on eliminating the influence of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression:

As an independent and sovereign people's country, our New China will never allow the cultural aggression of imperialists to continue. This is certain.

For more than a hundred years, U.S. imperialism, along with other imperialists, has carried out military, political, and economic aggression against China. Moreover, it has more cunningly and insidiously implemented aggression than other imperialists, carrying out enslavement education against the Chinese people with malice. It used a small portion of the "Boxer Indemnity" seized from the Chinese people, which they hated, through armed suppression of the Chinese people's resistance movement against imperialist aggression, and wealth extracted through economic aggression in China to "fund" schools, libraries (such as the former Tsinghua University and Beijing Library), and schools and hospitals run by churches. Especially during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, U.S. imperialism obtained more privileges from China and more actively engaged in cultural aggression. According to incomplete materials, among the twenty church-run universities across the country, seventeen were subsidized by the United States; among the more than three hundred middle schools, about two hundred were subsidized by the United States; and in the primary school sector, about one thousand five hundred were subsidized by the United States, accounting for about one-fourth of all church-run primary schools. U.S. imperialism regarded this kind of "funding" as a manifestation of "friendliness" towards China. In reality, as James, the former president of the University of Illinois, frankly admitted, "Spending some money to expand spiritual influence, even if only in a material sense, can yield more than using other methods. Commerce follows spiritual dominance is more reliable than following the military flag." Therefore, it sent imperialist elements to the schools that accepted U.S. subsidies to control school affairs openly or behind the scenes, spreading malicious ideas of being pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America, promoting the decadent and degenerate "American way of life," destroying Chinese national culture, harming the souls of Chinese children and youth, and further colluding with Kuomintang special agents to attack and persecute progressive students, and even using schools as cover to engage in espionage and sabotage activities that endangered China. Since the founding of New China, U.S. imperialism has seen its political, military, and economic aggression in China failing and attempted to intensify its cultural aggression activities. Especially since the great movement of the Chinese people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country has been launched, its destructive activities have become even more intensified. On November 28th, the U.S. imperialist Austin shamelessly and openly referred to this cultural aggression crime as "the traditional friendship of the United States to China" and as "golden threads linking the Chinese people and the American people in cultural aspects" at the United Nations Security Council. This is the greatest insult and slander of U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people and Chinese culture. On December 16th, the U.S. government announced the control of Chinese people's assets in the United States. Some church schools have also received notices from the United Board for Christian Colleges in China stating that subsidies cannot be remitted, attempting to create difficulties for the Chinese People's Government in running education and threatening the lives of some teachers, students, and staff in church schools. This further exposes that the so-called "funding" of schools by U.S. imperialism in China is by no means a "traditional friendship" or "cultural link," but merely for the sake of implementing aggression. When its aggression becomes impossible, it will use the cessation of "funding" to intimidate.

However, the great Chinese people will never be arbitrarily deceived and slandered by U.S. imperialists, nor will they be intimidated by the threats and posturing of U.S. imperialism. In recent months, patriotic compatriots throughout the country have launched a vigorous "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" movement, creating a new high tide of the anti-imperialist patriotic movement. Church groups and schools in major cities across the country have formed teams of thousands or tens of thousands of people, held parades and demonstrations, issued declarations, announced action programs, formulated patriotic covenants, and vigorously participated in the practical actions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, powerfully countering Austin's shameless slander that insulted the Chinese people.

Our Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, based on the common will of all Chinese people, approved Vice Premier Guo's report on the 29th of this month and issued the "Decision on the Policy of Handling Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Accepting U.S. Subsidies," calling on people's governments at all levels and compatriots across the country to uphold the spirit of patriotism, work together, and strive to completely realize the glorious mission proposed by Vice Premier Guo in his report in order to completely eliminate the cultural aggression influence of American imperialism in China.

This decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has significant historical significance in the history of Chinese culture and education and is completely in line with the will of the Chinese people. I call on colleagues in the education field across the country, especially all members of the board of directors and all teachers, students, and staff of church schools that accept U.S. subsidies, regardless of whether they are religious or non-religious, to unite more closely for the interests of our great motherland, raise their political awareness, eliminate the poison of being pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America, and conscientiously and correctly implement the policy on handling cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious groups that accept U.S. subsidies promulgated by the Government Administration Council, in order to realize the glorious mission proposed by Vice Premier Guo of "finally, thoroughly, permanently, and completely ending more than a hundred years of American imperialist cultural aggression against the Chinese people." Justice belongs to us, and victory will surely belong to us.

Minister of Health
Li Dequan Delivers a Speech
【This Newspaper】 Minister Li Dequan of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government delivered the following speech:

The "Report on the Policy of Handling Cultural, Educational, Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Accepting U.S. Subsidies" made by Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the Government Administration Council at the 65th meeting of the Government Administration Council and the decision of the Government Administration Council on this policy are correct measures that truly represent the will and demands of the broad masses of people across the country.

U.S. imperialists have carried out military, political, and economic aggression against our country for a long time, infringing on our country's sovereignty in various ways. On the other hand, they took out a very small portion of the spoils plundered from the Chinese people and, through the church, disguised as philanthropists, ran some schools, hospitals, clinics, etc. in our country, attempting to buy people's hearts and instill enslaving ideas in order to facilitate its poisonous plan to destroy China.

The hypocritical face of U.S. imperialism cannot hide its bloody robber's truth. The Chinese people have fought countless times against U.S. imperialism and finally drove it out of mainland China. However, the sinister plot of U.S. imperialism has not been abandoned. After invading Taiwan, bombing Northeast China, and suffering defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, it adopted tactics such as freezing China's assets in the United States, attempting to threaten the lives of those in churches, schools, and hospitals that accept U.S. subsidies. This shameless trick precisely exposes what the so-called "friendship" of Acheson, Austin, and others for the Chinese people is!

The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government is determined to implement the decision of the Government Administration Council on this policy and Vice Premier Guo's report for medical institutions across the country that accept U.S. subsidies. I call on all staff members in medical institutions that accept U.S. subsidies to unite as one, promote the spirit of patriotism, support and implement the government's decision, so that all medical institutions subsidized by the United States will become institutions completely run by the Chinese themselves and better play the role of serving the Chinese people.

Relief Administration Chairman
Soong Ching Ling Issues a Statement
【Xinhua News Agency, December 30th】 Chairman Soong Ching Ling of the Chinese People's Relief Administration issued a statement today supporting the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on controlling and investigating U.S. property and freezing U.S. public and private deposits. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an order on December 28th regarding the control and investigation of U.S. property and the freezing of U.S. public and private deposits. It is a correct measure to further oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against China in the economic sphere. A portion of U.S. property in China falls within the scope of relief and welfare undertakings. According to this order, of course, the People's Government must completely control and investigate all U.S. relief and welfare organizations in China. This is completely in line with the interests of the Chinese people, the interests of all men, women, old and young who are being relieved and cared for, and especially in line with the New Democratic relief and welfare policy. Although some kind-hearted American people truly have the desire to help the Chinese people in the relief and welfare work carried out by the United States in China for more than a hundred years, objectively, they have been directly or indirectly utilized by U.S. imperialism to play a role in covering up aggression, colluding with special agents, paralyzing the fighting spirit of our people, and buying people's hearts. Through this resolute measure of the Government Administration Council, it can just educate the people of the whole country to eliminate the slave thoughts and unpromising dependence viewpoints of being pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America more quickly, so as to support the People's Government more firmly in relying on the broad masses and improving the courage of self-reliance. Therefore, I call on all people in the relief and welfare circles in China to enthusiastically support this order of the Central People's Government with practical actions, recognize the essence of the wolf in sheep's clothing of U.S. imperialism, continue to participate in the mass movement to accuse U.S. imperialist aggression and insults, liquidate the remnants of pro-American, worshipping America, and fearing America thoughts, and resolutely implement the policy of the New China's relief and welfare undertakings instructed by Vice Premier Dong Biwu at the People's Relief Representatives Conference, implement the methods of production for self-relief, social mutual assistance, and government subsidies, so that all the relief and welfare organizations you are responsible for not only guarantee no destruction, but also can be completely new and better than before. Everyone should publicize and explain this order among the rescued people, further stimulate the enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, promote the enthusiasm of patriotism, and also clarify the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people and carry out internationalist education. We should also understand that the Central People's Government has only been established for just over a year, and the war is still going on, but our country has made unprecedented remarkable achievements in organizing finances, restoring the economy, and providing disaster relief and managing the Huai River, which is enough to show that the 475 million people of China are an incomparably great force. As long as we rely on the people and serve the people, any difficult problems can be solved easily. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and with the unity and cooperation of peace-loving people all over the world, China not only has enough confidence to heal the wounds of war, but also has enough power to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, defend Chinese peace, defend Asian peace, and defend world peace.

    教育部卫生部救济总会及京沪等地人民
    坚决拥护政务院两项措施
    为肃清美帝在中国的经济和文化侵略势力而斗争！
    十二月二十八日，中央人民政府政务院发布命令，决定由各地人民政府管制及清查美国政府和美国企业在我国境内的一切财产，冻结我国境内所有银行的一切美国公私存款。二十九日，政务院政务会议又通过了关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。这两项措施是对于美帝国主义对我国横蛮侵略的有效回击。有关这两项措施的命令和报告、决定公布之后，立即受到一切爱国人民的热烈拥护。教育部马叙伦部长、卫生部李德全部长、人民救济总会宋庆龄主席都发表谈话、声明，分别表示坚决执行政务院的命令和决定。北京、上海、广州等地人民，包括许多接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关和宗教团体中的人员，都表示坚决拥护政务院这两项措施。兹将各方人士发表的意见发表于下：
  教育部部长
   马叙伦发表谈话
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长为肃清美帝文化侵略影响发表谈话如下：
    作为一个独立自主的人民的国家，我们新中国决不允许帝国主义者的文化侵略继续下去，这是肯定了的。
    百余年来，美帝国主义不但和其它帝国主义一道，对中国肆行军事、政治和经济的侵略，并且较之其它帝国主义更加狡猾和阴险地实行侵略，对中国人民恶毒地实行奴化教育。它把用武力镇压中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略运动、劫夺去的中国人民所耻恨的“庚子赔款”中和经济侵略榨取去的财富中的一小部分，用在中国“资助”学校、图书馆（如以前的清华大学、北京图书馆）和教会办的学校、医院等。特别在国民党反动派统治期间，美帝国主义从中国取得了更多的特权，更加积极地从事文化侵略。根据不完全的材料，在全国二十所教会高等学校中间，受美国津贴的就有十七所；三百余所中学中间，受美国津贴的约近二百所；小学方面受美国津贴的约一千五百所左右，约占全部教会小学的四分之一。美帝国主义把这种“资助”作为对中国“亲善”的表示，实际上正如过去它的伊里诺大学校长詹姆生坦直自供的，“为了扩张精神上的影响而花一些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能够比用别的方法收获得多。商业追随精神上的支配，是比追随军旗更为可靠。”因此，它对接受美国津贴的学校，派遣帝国主义分子公开或在幕后把持校政，传播亲美、崇美、恐美的恶毒思想，鼓吹腐朽、堕落的“美国生活方式”，摧残中国的民族文化，戕害中国儿童和青年的灵魂，并进一步勾结国民党特务，打击和迫害进步同学，甚至以学校为掩护，从事危害中国的间谍破坏活动。新中国成立以来，美帝国主义看到它在中国的政治、军事、经济的侵略着着失败，企图更加加剧其文化侵略的活动，特别从我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动开展以来，它的这种破坏活动竟更变本加厉。十一月二十八日美帝国主义者奥斯汀，竟在联合国安全理事会上公然把这种文化侵略罪行，厚颜无耻地称之为“美国对中国的传统友谊”，称之为“在文化方面联系着中国人民和美国人民的金线”。这是美帝国主义对中国人民与中国文化的最大侮辱和污蔑。十二月十六日美国政府又宣布管制中国人民在美的资产，有的教会学校且已接到美国基督教联合托事部的通知，说是补助费已无法汇寄，企图借以制造中国人民政府办理教育的困难，威胁一部分教会学校员生的生活，这就更加暴露美帝国主义在中国的所谓“资助”学校，决不是什么“传统友谊”，或“文化联系”，而仅仅是为的实行侵略。当它的侵略成为不可能了，它就要以停止“资助”来恫吓了。
    然而，伟大的中国人民决不是美帝国主义者可以任意欺骗和污蔑的，也决不会被美帝国主义的恫吓和装腔作势所吓倒的。几个月来，我全国爱国同胞已掀起了轰轰烈烈的“抗美援朝保家卫国”的运动，造成了反帝爱国运动的新高潮。全国各大城市的教会团体和学校，曾结成了几千人几万人的队伍，举行游行示威，发表宣言，公布行动纲领，订立爱国公约，并以踊跃参加抗美援朝的实际行动，有力地回击了奥斯汀侮辱中国人民的无耻谰言。
    我中央人民政府政务院依据了全中国人民的共同意志，于本月二十九日批准了郭副总理的报告，发布了“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”，号召各级人民政府和全国同胞，本爱国精神，同心协力，为彻底实现郭副总理在其报告中所提出的光荣任务，以完全肃清美国帝国主义在中国的文化侵略影响而奋斗。
    中央人民政府政务院的这一决定，在中国文化教育史上有着重大的历史意义，是完全符合中国人民的意志的。我号召全国教育界同人，特别是所有接受美国津贴的教会学校的董事会同人和全体师生员工，不分教徒与非教徒，为着我们伟大祖国的利益，更加团结一致，提高自己的政治觉悟，扫除亲美、崇美、恐美的毒素，切实地和正确地贯彻政务院所颁布的关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针，以实现郭副总理所提出的“把一百余年来美国帝国主义对中国人民的文化侵略，最后地、彻底地、永远地、全部地加以结束”的光荣任务。正义是属于我们的，胜利也一定属于我们的。
    卫生部部长
    李德全发表谈话
    【本报讯】中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长发表谈话如下：
    中央人民政府政务院郭沫若副总理在政务院第六十五次政务会议上所作的“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的报告”和政务院关于这一方针的决定，是真正代表了全国广大人民的意志和要求的正确的措施。
    美帝国主义者在长时期中对我国进行了军事、政治和经济的侵略，采取各种方式侵害了我国的主权。另一方面则拿出从中国人民掠夺所得的赃物中的很少一部分，通过教会，伪装着慈善家的面孔，在我国办了一些学校、医院、诊所等等，企图收买人心，灌输奴化思想，以便于它实现灭亡中国的毒计。
    美帝国主义的伪善面孔，掩盖不住它的血淋淋的强盗真相。中国人民和美帝国主义进行了无数次的斗争，终于把它最后轰出了中国大陆。但是，美帝国主义的阴谋毒计并未放弃，在侵略我台湾、轰炸我东北以及在侵朝战争中遭受失败后，又采取了冻结我国在美国的财产等伎俩，企图威胁那些接受美国津贴的教会、学校和医院等机关中的人员的生活。这个无耻的伎俩，恰好暴露了艾奇逊、奥斯汀之流所说的所谓对于中国人民的“友谊”是什么东西！
    中央人民政府卫生部对于全国接受美国津贴的医疗机构，决心根据政务院关于这一方针的决定与郭副总理的报告予以实现。我号召接受美国津贴的医疗机构中的全体工作人员团结一致，发扬爱国精神，拥护并实现政府的决定，使一切受美国津贴的医疗机关变为完全由中国人自己办理的机关，并更好的发挥为中国人民服务的作用。
    救济总会主席
    宋庆龄发表声明
    【新华社三十日讯】中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席今日发表声明，拥护中央人民政府政务院关于管制清查美国财产冻结美国公私存款的命令。声明全文如下：
    十二月二十八日中央人民政府政务院发布关于管制清查美国财产冻结美国公私存款的命令。它是在经济上进一步反对美帝国主义侵略中国的正确的措施。美国在华财产的一部分是属于救济福利事业范围之内的。依据这一命令，当然要由人民政府全部管制与清查美国在华一切救济福利机构。这是完全符合于中国人民的利益，符合于所有被救济教养的男女老幼的利益，尤其是符合于新民主主义的救济福利方针的。美国在华百余年来所进行的救济福利工作，其中虽有若干美国善良的人民确有援助中国人民的愿望，但客观上都是被美帝国主义直接间接所利用而为它起了掩盖侵略、勾结特务、麻痹我国人民斗志、收买人心的作用的。经过政务院这一坚决的措施，恰好可以教育全国人民更快地肃清亲美、崇美、恐美的奴隶思想与没出息的依赖观点，从而更加拥护人民政府依靠广大群众而提高自力更生的勇气。因此，我号召中国一切救济福利界人士都以实际行动来热烈支持中央人民政府这一命令，认清美帝羊皮外衣豺狼内心的本质，继续参加控诉美帝侵略与侮辱的群众运动，清算亲美、崇美、恐美的思想残余，坚决贯彻董必武副总理在人民救济代表会议上所指示的新中国的救济福利事业的方针，实施生产自救，社会互济，政府补助的办法，使你们所负责的一切救济福利组织不但保证毫无破坏，而且能够焕然一新，比从前办得更好。大家应在被救济的人群中宣传解释这一命令，更高地激发抗美援朝情绪，发扬爱国主义的热忱，同时也应阐明中美人民之间的传统友谊，而展开国际主义的教育。我们更应明了中央人民政府成立至今不过年余，战争尚在进行，但我国在整理财政，恢复经济，救灾治淮等方面都有史无前例的卓越成就，尤足以说明中国四亿七千五百万人民是无比的伟大力量，只要我们依靠人民而又为人民服务，什么困难问题都能迎刃而解。我们深信在英明的毛主席与中国共产党的领导下，在与全世界爱好和平人士的团结合作下，中国不但具有足够的信心能够医治战争创伤，而且确有足够的力量解放台湾、西藏，保卫中国和平，保卫亚洲和平，保卫世界和平。
