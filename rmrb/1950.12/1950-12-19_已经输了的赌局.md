　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th (TASS): The latest issue of the magazine "New Times" published an editorial entitled "The Gambling Game That Has Already Been Lost." The article stated: Regardless of how the Korean War develops in the near future, one thing is certain – the gamble of American imperialism in Korea has ended in a miserable defeat. Neither Washington nor London can hide this now. The failure suffered by the American army in Korea has not only dealt an effective blow to the immediate plans of American imperialists for military aggression in the Far East, but also to its entire post-war policy. Therefore, the newspapers in the imperialist camp around the world have clamored and screamed.
　　The editorial pointed out: Truman's provocative statement on the Korean situation and his attempt to stir up another wave of war hysteria have aroused such a strong wave of anger that its impact cannot be ignored. All the facts show that American policy is extremely unpopular around the world and has met with resistance among the masses. It has even caused panic among bourgeois groups. This policy is increasingly isolating Washington. In countries that have been lured by the United States to join the Atlantic aggressive bloc, public opinion is exerting significant pressure on the rulers. Therefore, unmistakable signs of differences and divisions between the United States and its vassal states, especially in Britain and France, have emerged.
　　The failure of American imperialist policy in Korea has undoubtedly dealt a serious blow to the entire system of aggressive military alliances and blocs that American imperialism is hastily piecing together. In the capitals of Western European countries, the panic caused by the evolution of the Korean situation has been revealed in American newspapers, and American newspapers have been talking about the "rupture" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
　　The seriousness of Washington's political failure is no less than its strategic failure. The imperialists originally intended to place their Pacific front on the territories of Korea and China; they thought that the land of the Asian people could be plundered at will, but they were met with a counterattack from the Asian people. The Korean people have shown that they cannot be forced to their knees. The Chinese people have been inspired by deep patriotic enthusiasm. When the Chinese government announced that it would be able to protect its territory and country against the aggressive invasion of American imperialism, it was supported by the strong power of the people. The editorial further stated that American imperialists never expected to encounter such a high level of political maturity among the Asian people. The strength and determination of the people who have been fighting for their independence for thousands of years have overturned the most elaborate plans of the State Department.
　　This is a serious moral and political defeat suffered by the American imperialists. The American imperialists insisted on disregarding the laws of historical development and refused to recognize the right of countries to independence and freedom. The peace and democracy camp has once again demonstrated its strength and the justice of its cause. Therefore, the ruling group in Washington is currently in a state of panic and confusion.
　　The article pointed out that the result of the emergency meeting held by Attlee and Truman in the White House due to the defeat of MacArthur's army shows that Washington and London intend to continue to implement their aggressive policies, and they still adhere to the policy of force, even though this policy has been defeated. This is unambiguously stated in the official communiqué of the Du-Ai talks, the basic conclusions of which are: "First, the military capabilities of the United States and the United Kingdom should be increased as soon as possible. Second, the two countries should expand arms production."
　　The editorial concluded by saying that American and British newspapers are doing their best to spread rumors that obscure the truth: saying that Washington and London are revising their policies; but in reality, they are adhering to their adventurous policies, but are readjusting their aggressive plans. Everyone with a clear mind knows that the situation is becoming more and more unfavorable for the American aggressors; however, they are threatening humanity with new massacres.

    已经输了的赌局
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：最近一期《新时代》杂志发表社论，题为《已经输了的赌局》。该文略称：不管在不久的将来朝鲜战事的发展过程如何，有一件事是可以肯定的——美帝国主义在朝鲜的赌博，已经归于惨败。不论是华盛顿还是伦敦现在都无法掩饰这一点。美军在朝鲜所遭受的失败，已不仅使美帝国主义者在远东进行军事侵略的眼前的计划遭受了有效的打击，而且也使它的战后全部政策遭受了有效的打击。因此全世界帝国主义阵营中的报纸都哗然发出了叫嚣。
    社论指出：杜鲁门关于朝鲜情势的挑衅性声明以及他要煽起另一阵战争歇斯底里的企图，已激起了这样猛烈的愤怒浪潮，以致不能不发生其影响。种种事实表明：美国的政策，在全世界都是极不得人心的并且在群众中间遇到了反抗，它甚至在资产阶级集团中，也引起了惊慌。这种政策，使华盛顿越来越陷于孤立。在受美国诱骗而加入大西洋侵略集团的各国中，舆论正对统治者施以重大的压力。因此，在各附庸国内，特别是在英法两国与美国之间分歧与分裂的无可怀疑的迹象就表现出来了。
    朝鲜的美帝国主义政策的失败，无疑地已给了美帝国主义所正在匆促拼凑的侵略军事同盟与集团的整个系统一个严重的打击。在西欧各国首都，由于朝鲜局势演变所引起的惊惶失措的情形已在美国报纸上透露出来了，美国报纸已在谈论北大西洋同盟的“破裂”了。
    华盛顿在政治上失败的严重性不下于在战略上的失败。帝国主义者原来打算把他们的太平洋前线放在朝鲜与中国的领土上；他们原以为亚洲人民的土地是可以随意掠夺的，但是，他们却受到亚洲人民的回击。朝鲜人民已经表示他们是不能被迫屈膝的。中国人民已被深厚的爱国热情所激发起来了。当中国政府宣布它将能保护它的领土与国家抵抗美国帝国主义的侵略进犯时，它是得到了人民的坚强力量的支持的。社论进一步表示：美国帝国主义者从来没有料到：他们在亚洲人民当中会遇到这样高的政治上成熟的水平。数千年来为他们的独立一直在斗争的人民的力量与决心已把国务院最精细的计划打翻了。
    这是美国帝国主义者所受到的在道义上与政治上的严重失败。美帝国主义者竟硬要蔑视历史发展的规律，并且拒绝承认国家有独立与自由的权利。和平民主阵营又一度表明了它的力量和它的事业的正义性。因此，华盛顿统治集团目前陷于惊慌和混乱之中。
    该文指出：艾德礼和杜鲁门因麦克阿瑟军队的溃败在白宫所举行的紧急会谈的结果表明：华盛顿和伦敦打算继续执行他们的侵略方针，他们仍然坚持武力政策，虽然这个政策已遭到失败。这是毫不含糊地载在杜艾会谈的正式公报中，该公报的基本结论是：“第一，美国与联合王国的军事能力应尽速予以增加。第二，两国应扩大武器生产。”
    社论结束时称，美英报纸正在尽力传播蒙蔽是非的谣言：说什么华盛顿和伦敦正在修改他们的政策；但是实际上，他们正坚持他们的冒险方针，不过是重新调整他们的侵略计划而已。每一个神志清醒的人都知道：局势是变得一天比一天地更不利于美国侵略者了；可是，他们正以新的屠杀威胁着人类。
