The head of the Polish delegation spoke, pointing out that the U.S. accusations against China are an attempt to shift the blame.

The last speaker in the debate was the head of the Polish delegation, Mr. Wierblowski, who firmly opposed placing the slander case against China on the agenda of the General Assembly. Wierblowski emphasized that neither in the so-called explanatory memorandum of the six-nation delegation, nor in the speeches made by the drafters of the memorandum in the General Committee and at the current plenary session of the General Assembly, was there any direct evidence of direct or indirect aggression on the part of the Central People's Government of China. The participation of volunteers cannot be classified as interference, and this participation is in accordance with the principles of international law currently in effect. The participation of volunteers in war has never been referred to as interference. For example, volunteers from fifty-eight countries fought on the side of the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, but no one referred to those countries as aggressors. Wierblowski further recalled that Poles had participated as volunteers in the struggle for American independence and had fought alongside Garibaldi for the liberation of Italy.

Wierblowski continued: It is completely understandable and quite natural that the Chinese people are concerned about the development of the situation in Korea. He also said: The United States occupies China's island of Taiwan, thereby violating the integrity of Chinese territory. The United States also supports the remnants of the Kuomintang group, which obviously means trying to restore this group in China through aggression. Wierblowski reminded the General Assembly that accusations of aggression against China had already been made to the United States, but the United States had not responded to these accusations. The United States' accusations against the People's Republic of China at this moment are an attempt to shift the blame onto others. The U.S. armed intervention in Korea has been going on for almost six months. For six months, the Korean people have been fighting for their freedom and independence, resisting U.S. aggression under the banner of the United Nations. It is now very clear what the blind obedience of the majority in the United Nations to the U.S. delegation has led the United Nations into. Now is the time for the United Nations General Assembly to show more common sense—more common sense than we have seen so far. The United Nations should not put on the agenda a proposal aimed at expanding the conflict in Asia, but should seek ways to eliminate this dangerous conflict.

After Wierblowski's speech, a vote was immediately taken. The proposal to include the so-called "Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Interfering in Korea" case on the agenda was passed by a majority of fifty-one to five. The five countries voting against were the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; four abstained (India, Indonesia, Burma, Afghanistan).

The General Assembly then adjourned.

    波代表团团长发言指出
    美国对中国提出的控诉是企图将罪名转嫁别人
    辩论中最后发言的是波兰代表团团长威尔勃洛夫斯基，他坚决反对把对中国的诽谤案列入大会议程。威尔勃洛夫斯基着重指出：不管在六国代表团的所谓解释性备忘录中，或者在该备忘录的起草人在总务委员会在目前大会全会上所作的发言中，都没有关于中国中央人民政府方面直接或间接侵略的直接证明。志愿兵的参加是不能被列为干涉的，这种参加符合于现在有效的国际法原则。从来也没有把志愿兵参加战争指为干涉的。例如，来自五十八个国家的志愿兵就曾在西班牙内战中站在共和政府方面作过战，然而，却并没有人把那些国家指为侵略者。威尔勃洛夫斯基又追述说，波兰人曾经作为志愿兵而参加过争取美国独立的斗争，也曾经为意大利的解放而与加里波的并肩作战过。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基继续说：中国人民关切朝鲜形势的发展是完全可以理解而且十分自然的。他又说：美国占据了中国的岛屿台湾，从而侵犯了中国领土的完整。美国又支持国民党残余集团，这意思显然是要通过侵略的方法使这一集团在中国复辟。威尔勃洛夫斯基提醒大会说：关于侵略中国的控诉，早已向美国提出，但美国并没有答复这一控诉。美国在这个时刻来对中华人民共和国提出控诉，是企图把罪名转嫁到别人身上。美国对朝鲜的武装干涉已经进行了快六个月了。六个月来，朝鲜人民都在为了他们的自由和独立作战，抵抗打着联合国招牌的美国的侵略。现在已经看得很清楚，联合国中的多数派对于美国代表团的盲目的服从已经使联合国陷入了什么田地。现在是联合国大会表现出更多的常识——比我们到现在为止所看到的更多的常识的时候了。联合国不应把一项以扩大在亚洲的冲突为目的的提案列入议程，而应该寻求能够祛除这种危险的冲突的方法。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基发言以后，随即进行表决。主张将所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”案列入议程的提案，以五十一对五票的多数通过，投反对票的五国为苏联、乌克兰及白俄罗斯两苏维埃社会主义共和国，波兰，捷克斯洛伐克；四票弃权（印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿富汗）。
    大会至此休会。
