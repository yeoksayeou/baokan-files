    World Democratic Youth Federation Issues Appeal to Youth of the World
    Calls on Youth to Oppose American and British War Provocateurs
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th] TASS reports: The World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an appeal to the youth of the world on the 13th, stating: The people of all countries have unanimously voiced their opposition to Truman's provocative statement issued on November 30th. The talks between the heads of the American and British governments indicate that their intention is not to achieve peace, but to intensify the rearmament of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, promote the establishment of new defense forces in West Germany, and accelerate preparations for a third world war. The plans of the warmongers have affected the interests of youth around the world. Young people must not be indifferent to the threat of war. The World Federation of Democratic Youth calls on the youth of the world to more resolutely oppose the new war instigators. Young people must unite to ban all weapons of mass destruction of humanity, oppose the expansion of armaments and the preparation of war, overthrow policies that mean poverty and death, oppose the reconstruction of the German defense forces, strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War and other conflicts that are occurring, and implement the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress to strive for peace.

    世界民主青联发表告全世界青年书
    号召青年反对美英战争挑拨者
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界民主青年联盟十三日发表告全世界青年书称：世界各国人民已一致声言反对杜鲁门在十一月三十日发表的挑衅声明。美国和英国政府的首脑在华盛顿的会谈，表示他们的意图不是为获致和平，而是要加紧重整北大西洋联盟国家的军备，促成在西德建立新的国防军，加速准备第三次世界大战。战争贩子们的计划已影响了全世界青年的利益。青年们对战争威胁决不能漠不关心。世界民主青年联盟号召全世界青年更坚决地反对新战争挑拨者。青年们必须团结起来，禁止一切大规模屠杀人类的武器，反对扩充军备和准备战争，打倒意味着贫困和死亡的政策，反对重建德国国防军，争取和平解决朝鲜战争及现在发生的其他冲突，实行第二届世界保卫和平大会的决议以争取和平。
