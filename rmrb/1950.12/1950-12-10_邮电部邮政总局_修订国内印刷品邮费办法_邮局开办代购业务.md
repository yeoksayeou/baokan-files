    Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Postal Administration
    Revises Domestic Printed Matter Postage Regulations
    Post Offices Begin Agency Purchase Services
    The original regulations of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Postal Administration, stipulated that all documents and letters from government agencies and organizations, of an official nature, regardless of whether they were entirely mimeographed or machine-printed, must be sent as letters and could not be sent as printed matter. This has now been revised so that items printed by mimeograph or machine, sent to the post office in batches of 20 or more copies with identical text, can be sent as printed matter with the appropriate postage. Furthermore, unused stationery, envelopes, notebooks, official documents, various industrial and commercial forms, simple ledgers, diaries, trademark paper, and sign paper, each weighing less than 200 grams, can also be sent as printed matter. Items weighing more than 200 grams should still be sent as "letters" or "parcels" "small packages" accordingly.
    In other news: In order to facilitate the public's purchase of goods from various locations, the Beijing Postal Administration has issued a notice to its affiliated post offices to begin "agency purchase services." Please inquire at your local post office for detailed information.

    邮电部邮政总局
    修订国内印刷品邮费办法
    邮局开办代购业务
    邮电部邮政总局原规定凡各机关、团体之函令等件，属于公文性质者，不论是否全部用油印或机印，均须按信函交寄，不得按印刷品类交寄。兹经修订为油印机等印出之件，同时向邮局交寄二十份以上，每件文字相同者，即可照印刷品付费交寄。又未经使用之信纸、信封、练习簿、公文纸、各种工商表册、单式帐簿、日记簿、商标纸、招牌纸，每件重量在二百公分以下者，亦得作印刷品交寄，重量超过二百公分以上时，仍应分别按“信函”或“包裹”“小包”交寄。
    又讯：北京邮政管理局为便利公众向各地购买物品起见，已通令所属各邮局开办“代购业务”。详细办法请向附近邮局询问。
