    Wuhan People Denounce Dulles's Absurd Remarks
    Representatives from Twenty-Six Schools Gather to Accuse U.S. Imperialist Atrocities
    Christian, Catholic Organizations and Students Returned from America Issue Declarations
    [Xinhua News Agency] Major universities, middle schools, church groups, and students returned from the United States in Wuhan have successively denounced the atrocities of U.S. imperialism and protested Dulles's slander against the Chinese people.
    More than five thousand teachers and students representatives from twenty-six universities, colleges, and middle schools in Wuhan jointly held a rally at Zhongyuan University Square on the 18th to accuse U.S. imperialist atrocities and refute Dulles's slander against the Chinese people. Zhang Jiewen, a student from Yixun Girls' Middle School, and Zhou Zuhui, a student from Wuchang Senior Commercial Vocational School, who had recently returned to Hankou from Chongqing, accused the heinous crimes of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" in Chongqing, under the command of U.S. imperialism, of slaughtering patriotic compatriots. Zhou Zuhui said that her brother was also executed by special agents using the American electric chair torture.
    Christian and Catholic church groups, church hospitals, and church school personnel in Wuhan jointly issued a declaration on the 15th, protesting against Dulles's shameless slander. The declaration stated: "The cause of the church is the cause of all peace-loving and religiously enthusiastic people. Dulles calls these causes 'favors,' which is a slander against our country's Catholics, Christians, and personnel working in church organizations. We are even more aware that U.S. imperialism cunningly uses various methods to attempt to buy the hearts of the Chinese people, spread the poison of the 'American way of life,' and attempt to use money to cultivate 'talents' who despise the motherland and admire the United States, in order to achieve the conspiracy of enslaving and exploiting the Chinese people. We will not only not be used by U.S. imperialism, but also strengthen our patriotism, resolutely uphold justice, and oppose aggression. The declaration was signed by: Wei Zhuomin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Christian Association and President of Huazhong University, Liu Nianfen, General Secretary of the Hankou YWCA, Wang Tong, General Secretary of the Wuchang YMCA, Liu Chunquan, General Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Christian Association, Han Guangguo, Catholic Father and Principal of St. Joseph's Girls' Middle School, Zhou Yuying, Principal of Yixun Girls' Middle School, Song Ruhai, General Secretary of the Hankou YMCA, Zhang Haisong, Bishop of the Xiang and E Diocese of the Chinese Sheng Kung Hui, Xiao Guogui, Chairman of the Hubei Diocese of the Methodist Church, Dong Jiaqing, Professor of the Union Theological Seminary, Li Huizu, Principal of Wenhua Middle School, and more than forty others.
    Wu Baoliang, Chairman of the Wuhan University School Affairs Committee, Cha Qian, Vice Chairman, Wei Zhuomin, President of Huazhong University, Huang Pu, Vice President, and Zhou Huanzhang, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Provisional Working Committees of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Dissemination, and other ninety-two people, all returned students from America, jointly issued the "Declaration Supporting the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country." The declaration stated: We are determined to fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers who are aiding Korea and strike at the destroyers of peace in the Far East. We believe that only in this way can we completely shatter the conspiracy of the U.S. rulers to invade China and enable our motherland to engage in economic and cultural construction in a peaceful and unthreatened environment.
