    Korean Foreign Minister Park Hun-young Sends Telegram to the United Nations
    Again Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities in Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, from a certain place in northern Korea, December 1st dispatch] According to TASS, Park Hun-young, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram on November 26th to the President of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, again protesting the bloody atrocities of the U.S. military in Korea, and demanding that the United Nations take measures to stop these atrocities by the U.S. military in Korea. The telegram detailed the recent large-scale massacre of the Korean people by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops, including the killing of over 7,000 people by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops in Pyongyang, over 2,700 people in Gyeongju, over 1,400 people in Chorwon (transliteration), over 1,000 people in Songrim (transliteration), over 1,200 people in Sunan (transliteration), over 700 people in Geochon (transliteration), over 900 people in Anju (transliteration), over 800 people in Jeongju, about 1,400 peaceful residents in Icheon and Bakcheon, over 900 people in Chosan, and the arrest and torture of over 800 people in Huichon.
    The telegram pointed out: The U.S. invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army, in violation of generally recognized principles of international law, have carried out mass collective killings of members of various Korean democratic parties and public organizations, and have abused retaliation against their families. For example, on October 2nd, the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops shot and killed eight family members of Labor Party members in Seoul, one of whom was the 60-year-old mother of a Labor Party member. On the same day, about 30 Seoul residents were shot dead on the banks of the Han River, their crime being that they had joined trade unions influenced by the Labor Party. On October 4th, a nine-year-old child in Chuncheon had his hands cut off because he had previously held a small flag of the Korean Republic to welcome the People's Army.
    The telegram continued: The U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops have frantically harmed women in the areas they have occupied. The U.S. military arrested more than a thousand women in Pyongyang, subjected them to barbaric torture, raped them, and then shot them dead. In all cities in North and South Korea with a large number of U.S. troops, the U.S. and Syngman Rhee authorities have organized so-called "U.S. Military Comfort Teams," forcibly taking women aged fifteen to thirty-five into these "Comfort Teams."
    The telegram concluded: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the will of the Korean people, once again firmly protests the outrageous acts of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee troops in Korea that blatantly violate international law standards and human morality, and declares that the U.S. government, which intervened in Korea, must bear full responsibility for these atrocities. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again firmly asserts that the United Nations—whose flag is being despicably used to cover up U.S. aggression in Korea—should take all measures to stop these atrocities of the U.S. military in Korea.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永致电联合国
    再次抗议美军在朝暴行
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社朝鲜北部某地讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于十一月二十六日致电联合国本届大会主席和安全理事会主席，再次抗议美军在朝鲜的血腥暴行，并要求联合国采取措施，制止美军在朝鲜的这种暴行。该电详细列举了美、李匪军最近大批屠杀朝鲜人民的数字，其中包括美、李匪军在平壤枪杀了七千余人，在庆州枪杀了二千七百余人，在铁原（译音）枪杀了一千四百余人，在松林（译音）枪杀了一千余人，在顺安（译音）枪杀了一千二百余人，在居村（译音）枪杀了七百余人，在安镇（译音）枪杀了九百余人，在定州枪杀了八百余人，在宜川和博川枪杀了一千四百左右的和平居民，在楚山枪杀了九百余人，在熙川逮捕和虐杀了八百余人。
    该电指出：美国侵略军和李承晚伪军违反一般公认的国际法的原则，竟大批地集体屠杀朝鲜各民主党派与公共团体的人员，并对他们的家属滥施报复。例如，十月二日，美、李匪军在汉城枪杀了八名劳动党员的家属，其中有一位是一个劳动党员的六十岁的老母。同日在汉江江岸又枪毙了约三十名汉城居民，他们的罪名是加入了劳动党影响下的工会。十月四日，春川一个九岁儿童的双手被砍去，因为他以前曾拿着朝鲜共和国的小国旗，欢迎过人民军。
    该电继称：美李匪军在其所侵占的地区里，曾疯狂地残害妇女。美军在平壤逮捕了一千多名妇女，对她们施以野蛮酷刑，强奸她们，然后把她们枪毙。在一切有着大量美军的北、南朝鲜的城市中，美李当局都组织了所谓“美军慰劳队”，把凡年在十五岁到三十五岁的妇女都强迫抓到这种“慰劳队”里。
    该电最后称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表朝鲜人民的意志，再度坚决抗议美、李军队在朝鲜所犯的悍然破坏国际法的标准和人类道德的暴行，并宣布这些暴行必须由干涉朝鲜的美国政府负完全责任。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再度坚决主张联合国——它的旗帜正被卑污地用来掩饰美国在朝鲜的侵略——应采取各种措施，制止美国军队在朝鲜的这种暴行。
