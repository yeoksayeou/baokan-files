To provide some foreign journalists on temporary visits and progressive journalists stationed in Berlin with the opportunity to understand the overall picture of the German Democratic Republic, the Republic government's propaganda bureau specifically organized a twenty-person tour group to visit various parts of the country. Participants included journalists from the Soviet Union's *Pravda*, the Polish Press Agency, the Czech News Agency, the Italian *Farmer's Newspaper*, the French *Rights and Freedom*, and myself. The group leader was Zha Daike, Deputy Director of the News Department of the Propaganda Bureau. The Republic government specially allocated a new-style large automobile to us, along with a staff member to handle miscellaneous affairs. The duration of our trip was set at eight days, and the itinerary had been determined before departure. Eisler, the Director of the Propaganda Bureau, repeatedly told everyone: Organizing a journalist tour group to travel across the country is a first, and he hoped that within those eight days, the journalists could see an outline of the new German Democratic Republic....

On the morning of June 14th, the sky was slightly cloudy, and it wasn't as swelteringly hot as it had been in the past few days. Our car left Berlin and headed along the highway to Potsdam, to visit the rural areas of Brandenburg Province to see the lives of farmers after land reform and the tractor stations.

It was the time when cherries were ripe and wheat was turning yellow. Our first stop was the town of Barez, sixty kilometers from Berlin, where the Central Agricultural College and affiliated farm, under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, were located. The college was housed in a large, creamy-white building surrounded by woods and lawns, which had originally been the villa of Queen Louise, the mother of German Emperor Wilhelm I. After World War I, the building and the land of nearby villages fell into the hands of a Prince Henderlich. This was a typical example of the so-called aristocratic landowners (Junkers). Brandenburg Province was a relatively concentrated area of Prussian aristocratic landowners and a major stronghold of German militarism.

After the Soviet army captured Berlin in 1945, the Soviet military government quickly established land reform committees in the Soviet occupation zone (i.e., the provinces under the jurisdiction of the current Democratic Republic) in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and immediately implemented land reform, completing this task by 1946. According to the land reform regulations, the properties of large landowners with more than 100 hectares (hectares) were all confiscated without compensation and distributed to farmers with no or little land, especially new farmers who had returned from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other places. In order to improve agriculture and conduct necessary agricultural experiments, part of the confiscated land was converted into state-owned farms or agricultural experiment stations. The landowners' manors, livestock, and machinery were also confiscated without compensation, and the landowners themselves had to move to places at least fifty kilometers away from their original estates. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the rural class divisions and land area distribution before and after the land reform within the territory of the Democratic Republic were as follows: (See table)

Total cultivated area before land reform in the German Democratic Republic:
              (1939 statistics)
Class Category                    Land Area             Percentage
Large Landlords Over 100 hectares    2,655,600 hectares       29.7%
Rich Peasants    20-100 hectares    2,688,100 hectares      30%
Middle Peasants  5-20 hectares       2,698,200 hectares    30.1%
Small Peasants   0.5-5 hectares       917,900 hectares        10.2%
Poor Peasants    Under 0.5 hectares    224,400 hectares      Percentage not included

Total cultivated area after land reform in the German Democratic Republic:
              (1946 statistics)
Class Category                    Land Area              Percentage
Public Farms or Experiment Stations Over 100 hectares    934,300 hectares    11.1%
Rich Peasants    20-100 hectares    2,473,700 hectares      29.3%
Middle Peasants  5-20 hectares     4,088,300 hectares   48.5%
Small Peasants   0.5-5 hectares      937,400 hectares    11.1%
Poor Peasants    Under 0.5 hectares      862,500 hectares    Percentage not included

The Central Agricultural College's farm has a total of 250 hectares of land, which was one of Prince Henderlich's three large estates near the town. The farm currently has sixty workers and three tractors. As for the large number of pigsties, cowsheds, and other facilities, they were all there from the old days.

The principal told us that the agricultural college is a short-term training class, with a four-month term. The students are all transferred from agricultural schools in various provinces, and 25% are women. The courses include: the problem of German unification, political economy, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, planned economy issues, and land policies, as well as agricultural science courses based on the Michurin theory. After graduation, students are assigned to work on state-owned farms and tractor stations throughout the country. At the same time, after the realization of German democratic unification, they will become the vanguards and backbones of land reform in West Germany.

After lunch at the agricultural college, we originally planned to visit a Michurin orchard three kilometers away, but because the village chief of the village of Talton, sixty kilometers away, called and was waiting for us to visit the village, we had to reluctantly forgo the visit. The principal briefly talked about the history of that orchard: During the years when the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union, they burned down many Michurin farms in the Soviet Union, but at the same time, they stole many Michurin tree species, some of which were sold to this large landowner.

It was already three o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at Talton Village. The village chief greeted us off the car by the asphalt road at the entrance of the village. He made a welcoming speech on the spot, saying: "The fact that you journalists have come to the countryside to see us shows that the world's democratic family has trusted the German people. The German people have started a new life and will never fight against other peoples again. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, we survived the famine of 1945-46. After your visit, you will see how we are embarking on a new and correct path."

The village chief then introduced the situation of the village: Before the land reform, the land in the village all belonged to the landowner Schneiderwein. His family owned a total of 600 hectares, including those in other villages. Now, there are a total of 53 households in the village, 38 of which are new households that returned from outside after the war. Each of them has been allocated an average of five to six hectares of land; eight old farmers who had no land in the past have been given land, with the most receiving eight hectares of land, and the other five households are small handicraft workers and small merchants who run shops. There are no rich peasants in the village.

In the first two years after the land reform, there were difficulties with machinery, horses, seeds, and even food. Villages organized peasant mutual aid societies (rich peasants were not allowed to participate). In this society, a committee was elected by democratic methods to make plans before cultivation, based on the village's land, crop timing, and the capacity of horses and machines, stipulating which day whose land would be cultivated and whose horses would be used; those without horses had to pay for horse labor according to time, or repay with a certain amount of manual labor. Part of the tractors confiscated from the landowners were also handed over to the peasant mutual aid society for management, but experience has shown that in order to maintain the good performance of the machines, it must be the responsibility of specialized tractor stations. In addition to solving the difficulties of the farmers themselves, the mutual aid society discusses the planting plans of various crops assigned to the village by the government before each sowing season, so as to determine which family's piece of land will grow wheat and which will grow sugar beets. The livestock problem has now been solved, because there is a national tractor station six kilometers away, where people can borrow tractors at any time.

The village chief told us: The only shortcoming now is that the branch of the agricultural cooperative in the village has not yet been established. "It will be soon," he said affirmatively. "The cooperative branch in the district has decided to establish a branch in the village. At that time, seeds, fertilizers, tools, and small loans can be solved more easily." As he spoke, many people gathered around, and the director of the mutual aid society also arrived. Some farm women drove horse-drawn carts back from the fields and were stopped there. Some men shouted to the women who were hilling potatoes and weeding sugar beets in the nearby fields to hurry back, saying that foreign guests had come to visit. We followed the village chief and the director of the mutual aid society to visit the homes of various new households separately. I went to the home of a family named Browillett.

The Browillett family's house is a small two-story brick building next to a small courtyard by the street. When we walked in, Kurt Browillett, a 25-year-old farmer, was sitting in the downstairs living room/dining room reading the *New Germany* newspaper. He let us sit in the armchairs next to a table covered with a snow-white floral cloth and with a long-necked vase holding a bouquet of blooming red roses, while he sat next to a new-style radio in the corner. The light yellow walls and newly oiled pine floors gleamed pleasantly, not unlike a hotel in a big city. There were three other small rooms downstairs: a room for his mother, a kitchen (with electric lights and running water), and another room including a toilet and storage room. Upstairs, there was another large room, which was the bedroom for him, his wife, and their three-year-old daughter.

As Kurt began to tell the story of his move to the village, his 65-year-old mother also came. His family originally lived in East Prussia, and his father worked as a hired hand for a landlord and died of overwork a year before the war began. In 1945, Kurt and his mother packed their family property - a few old clothes and eating utensils - into a suitcase and came to Talton Village with the help of the Red Army. Because he and his mother were both able to work, the land committee immediately allocated them five hectares of good land. As Kurt's mother said, "This is the first time in Browillett's ancestry that they have owned land!" In the first year, they first lived temporarily in another farmer's house under the coordination of the mutual aid society. They borrowed money from the cooperative bank, and started building their own house the following year. Kurt also got married, and by last year, the principal and interest of the loan had been paid off. This year's wheat and sugar beets will have a good harvest, and Kurt estimates that after paying taxes, food, and adding 3,000 marks for clothing expenses, there will be a surplus of 1,500 marks. Part of it will be used to plaster the exterior walls of the house with cement, separate the cowsheds (now two families share a large shed), and add a pigsty and goat pen, because this year he will raise two litters of piglets and twenty goats.

In the evening, the village chief invited the reporters to have dinner at the village office, and all the farmers came to accompany us. We ate a meat soup, a roast goose, and a cake, as well as wine brewed by the farmers themselves, which tasted particularly fresh and mellow. After bidding farewell to the farmers who lived a happy life, we drove along the flat cement road under the descending night to a large villa on the top of the ancient and wealthy Celser Mountain, which used to belong to a Junker landowner but is now leased to private operators by the government, to spend the night. Early the next morning, we rushed to the state-owned tractor station in the town of Frankhausen for a visit. Although this station was only established in March 1949, by the spring of 1950, it still maintained the glorious banner of being the first among the 521 tractor stations in the country.

After listening to the stationmaster's brief introduction, we learned that there were a total of forty-six staff members in the station, including eight administrative staff (including accountants, cultural staff, and typists), twenty-eight tractor drivers, four machine repair workers, as well as car drivers and miscellaneous workers. The station had twenty-eight tractors, divided into five teams, stationed in nearby garages, in order to cultivate for farmers in fourteen nearby villages. In 1949, 47% of the total cultivated area of these fourteen villages (about 12,000 hectares) was cultivated by these twenty-eight tractors.

In the fourteen villages for which the station is responsible, each farmer mutual aid society elects a liaison officer to be in charge of contacting the station. The number of land acres in each village to be cultivated by tractors and the order of priority are determined in advance by the liaison officer and the station according to the season. For each hectare of land cultivated, the farmer pays 46 marks (new households and poor farmers pay 15-30% less), which can also be replaced by grain or rapeseed oil. The tractor driver's salary is paid according to the number of acres he has cultivated, and he is personally responsible for his work. If the farmer is not satisfied with the cultivation, he must re-cultivate it once according to the specific situation. After cultivating a certain amount of cultivated land, the station will issue a series of vouchers to the farmer for payment after harvest.

Farmers in Talton Village told me that cultivation with tractors is deeper than cultivation with horses and is also cheaper, which saves farmers a lot of time to engage in cultural activities. The tractor station also has a library, which provides farmers with books, and often invites film crews and troupes to perform in various villages together with the Youth League and trade union organizations. Regardless of the rumors spread by some reactionary rich peasants, the farmers deeply experience the benefits brought to them by the state-owned tractor station. Thirty-year-old Karl Müller is a model tractor driver at this station. During the first harvest after the station was established last year, he alone used a Soviet-made KD35 tractor to harvest and bundle 98 hectares of wheat in 19 days. This efficiency allowed the harvest work of the farmers cultivated by him to be completed in a timely manner. The farmers gave him the glorious title of hero. When I visited Müller, he said, "Because the farmers' land is fragmented and scattered (an average of 0.65 hectares per plot), the number of machine transfers is increased, and the work is delayed. Otherwise, his cultivation efficiency would be even higher."

When we left the office and went to visit the warehouse and repair shop, the machine workers and drivers were busy preparing the machines in order to meet the upcoming harvesting task.

    民主德国农村新景
    德意志民主共和国访问记之八
    ·吴文焘·
    为了使临时来访问的一些外国记者和常驻柏林的进步记者有机会了解德意志民主共和国的全貌，共和国政府宣传局特别组织了一个二十个人的参观团赴全国各地访问。参加参观团的有苏联真理报、波兰通讯社、捷克通讯社、意大利农民报、法国权利与自由等报的记者和我，其余都是本国报纸和通讯社、画报的记者和翻译人员。团长是宣传局的新闻处副处长乍代克。共和国政府特别拨给我们一辆新型的大汽车，还有一个工作人员管杂务。我们旅行的期限定为八天，参观的程序在出发前便已经确定了。宣传局长艾斯拉并再三告诉大家：组织记者参观团游行全国，这还是第一次，希望在八天的时间里，记者们能看到新的德意志民主共和国的一个轮廓……。
    六月十四日清早，天微微有些浮云，已经不像前几天那样燥热了。我们的车子离开了柏林，沿着通波茨坦的公路，到布兰登堡省的农村去访问土改后的农民生活和拖拉机站等。
    正是樱桃熟麦梢黄了的时节。我们的第一站是离柏林六十公里的巴烈兹镇，这里有农业部领导的中农央业学院和附属农场。农学院的校址是一座四面围着丛林和草坪的乳白色的大建筑，本是德皇威廉一世的母亲露易斯皇后的别墅。第一次世界大战后，这所建筑和附近各村落的地产，都落到一个亨得利赫王子的手中。这就是所谓贵族地主（容克）的一个典型的例子。布兰登堡省是普鲁士贵族地主的一个比较集中的地方，也是德国军国主义的一个大本营。
    一九四五年苏军攻克柏林后，苏军的军政府很快就依照波茨坦协定在苏占区（即现在的民主共和国所辖各省）成立了土地改革委员会，并立即实行土地改革，到一九四六年便完成了这项工作。按照土地改革条例，一百海克特（公顷）以上的大地主地产都全部无代价地予以没收，分给无地或少地的农民，特别是新从波兰、捷克等地迁回来的农户。为了改良农业及进行必要的农事试验，被没收的土地的一部分改作了国营农场或农业试验所。地主的庄园、牲畜和机器也全部无代价地予以没收，地主本人必须迁出本庄五十公里以外去住。根据农业部的统计，在民主共和国所辖境内土地改革前后的农村阶级分划和占地面积分配情形如下：（见表）
    德意志民主共和国土改前总耕种面积：
                （１９３９统计）
    阶级分类                        占地面积                  百分比
    大地主    １００公顷以上    ２，６５５，６０公顷        ２９．７％
    富农      ２０—１００公顷    ２，６８８，１００公顷      ３０％
    中农      ５—２０公顷        ２，６９８，２００公顷    ３０．１％
    小农      ０．５—５公顷      ９１７，９００公顷        １０．２％
    贫农      ０．５公顷以下      ２２４，４００公顷      百分比未计入
    德意志民主共和国土改后总耕种面积：
              （１９４６统计）
    阶级分类                      占地面积                    百分比
    公共农场或试验所  １００公顷以上    ９３４，３００公顷    １１．１％
    富农      ２０—１００公顷  ２，４７３，７００公顷      ２９．３％
    中农        ５—２０公顷     ４，０８８，３００公顷   ４８．５％
    小农        ０．５—５公顷      ９３７，４００公顷    １１．１％
    贫农        ０．５公顷以下      ８６２，５００公顷    百分比未计入
    中央农业学院的农场共有二百五十海克特土地，就是亨得利赫王子在本镇附近的三个大田产之一。农场现有六十个工人，三部拖拉机。至于大量的猪房、牛栏和其他设备，都是旧时就有了的。
    校长告诉我们：农学院是一个短期学习班，四个月一期，学生都是从各省农业学校调来的，百分之二十五是妇女。课程有：德国的统一问题，政治经济学，苏联与人民民主国家，计划经济问题及土地政策等，另外就是以米邱林学说为基础的农业科学课程。学生毕业后，即派到各地国营农场及拖拉机站去工作，同时在德国民主统一实现后，他们将成为西德土地改革的先锋队和骨干。
    在农学院吃了中饭，本想到三公里外的一个米邱林果园去参观，但因六十公里以外的塔尔顿村的村长打电话来等着我们到该村去参观，只好就割爱不去了。校长简单讲了一下那个果圃的历史：在纳粹进攻苏联的年月中，他们把苏联的很多米邱林农场都烧毁了，同时却偷来了很多的米邱林树种，其中的一部分就卖给了这位大地主。
    到塔尔顿村时已经是下午三点钟了。村长在村口的柏油公路旁迎接我们下车，当场致欢迎词说：“各位记者来乡下看我们，表示世界的民主家庭已经对德国人民有了信任。德国人民已经开始了新的生活，永远再不向他国人民作战。感谢苏联的帮助，我们度过了一九四五——四六年的饥荒。你们参观后，会看到我们是怎样走上新的正确的道路的。”
    村长接着介绍本村的情况：在土地改革前，本村的地都是属于地主施尼德文的。他一家连在外村的，共占地六百海克特。现在，村里共有五十三户人家，其中三十八户是战后从外面迁回来的新户。他们每户平均分到五到六海克特的土地；过去没有地的老农户有八家，最多的分到八海克特的土地，其他五户是小手工业者和开铺子的小商人，本村没有富农。
    在土改后的最初两年中，机器、马匹、种籽甚至食粮等都有困难，各个村都组织了农民互助会（富农不得参加）。在这个会里由民主方法选出一个委员会来，按照本村的土地、作物时间和马匹机器的能力，在耕种之前作出计划来，规定那天种谁的地，用谁的马；没有马的，要按时间付马工工钱，或用一定的人工偿还。从地主手里没收的一部分拖拉机，也交给农民互助会管理，但经验证明，要使机器保持完好的效能，必须由专门的拖拉机站来负责。互助会除了解决农民们本身的困难外，每年播种前讨论政府所交给本村的各种作物种植计划，以便决定那家的那一块地种小麦，那一块种甜菜等。现在的畜力问题，已经解决了，因为六公里以外就是一个国家拖拉机站，人们随时可以从那里借到拖拉机。
    村长告诉我们：现在唯一的缺点，是本村农业合作社的支社还没建立起来。“快了，”他肯定地说，“区上的合作分社已经决定要在本村建立一个支社。那时，种子、肥料、工具和小宗贷款都可以更容易地解决了。”说着，很多人都围上来了，互助会的主任也来了。一些农妇赶着马车从地里回来，被阻在那里。有些男人便呼喊在附近地里封洋芋沟和锄甜菜的妇女们快回来，说是外国客人来拜访了。我们随着村长和互助会主任分头去到各新户家里去拜访。我去的是一个姓布罗威烈特的家里。
    布罗威烈特家的住房在大街旁边的一个小坪后面，是一所红砖的两层小楼房。我们走入时，二十五岁的农民库尔特·布罗威烈特正坐在楼下一间会客室兼饭厅的屋子里看《新德意志》日报。他让我们坐在靠窗子的一张铺着雪白花布、摆着一束盛开的红玫瑰花的长头瓶的桌子旁边的靠背椅上，他自己坐在靠墙角的一个新型的无线电收音机旁边。漆成米黄色的墙壁和上过油的新松木地板，发着可人的光彩，这和大城市的旅馆真是毫无二致。楼下还有三个小间，一间是母亲的住房，一间厨房（电灯、自来水俱全），另一间包括厕所和仓房。楼上还有一大间，是他们夫妻和三岁的小女儿的卧室。
    当库尔特开始讲述他迁来本村的历史时，六十五岁的母亲也走来了。他家原住在东普鲁士，父亲给一家地主作雇工，在战争开始前的一年，就病累而死了。一九四五年，库尔特和母亲把他们的家产——几件破旧的衣服和吃饭的用具装在一只皮箱里，由红军帮助来到塔尔顿村。因为他和母亲都能劳动，土地委员会就立即分给他们五海克特好地。正像库尔特的母亲所说：“这是布罗威烈特从祖上第一次自己有了土地！”第一年，他们先经互助会的调剂寄住在另一个农民家里。他们向合作银行贷了款，次年就动工自己修房子。库尔特也结婚了，到去年，贷款的本利已经还清。今年的麦子和甜菜将有丰收，库尔特估计：除了交税、食用和添制衣服消费三千马克外，将余一千五百马克。其中一部分，就用来把住房的外墙用洋灰抹起来，牛棚隔起来（现在是两家共用一个大棚），并加盖一所猪栏和山羊圈，因为今年他将养两窝小猪和二十头山羊。
    傍晚的时候，村长邀请记者们在村公所吃晚饭，所有的农民都来作陪。我们吃了一个肉汤，一道煎鹅肉，一道蛋糕，还有农民自己酿造的葡萄酒，味道格外清新醇厚。我们和生活美满的农民相互祝福告别之后，就沿着夜幕初降的坦平的洋灰公路到古富豪塞尔山顶的以前属于容克地主而现在由政府租给私人经营的一个大别墅中过夜。第二天清早，就赶到福兰肯豪逊镇的国营拖拉机站去参观。这个站，虽是一九四九年三月才建立起来的，到一九五○年春季，它仍然保持着全国五百二十一个拖拉机站中第一名的光荣旗。
    听了站长的简略介绍，知道站里共有四十六个工作人员，包括八个行政人员（包括会计、文化员、打字员），二十八个拖拉机手，四个机器修理工人，另外还有汽车司机和杂务工人。站里有拖拉机二十八架，分为五个队，分驻在附近的车场，以便就近为十四个村的农民耕作。在一九四九年，这十四个村的全部耕种面积的百分之四十七（约有一二、○○○海克特）都是用这二十八架拖拉机耕作的。
    在本站所负责的十四个村中，都由农民互助会选出一个联络员，专司与站方接触。各村要用拖拉机耕作的地亩数和先后的次序，都按季节预先由联络员和站方订出计划。每耕一海克特地，农户出资四十六个马克（新户及贫农得少交百分之十五——三十），用粮食或菜籽油代替也可。拖拉机驾驶员的工资即按他所耕作的亩数来给，并对他的工作个人负责。如农户对耕作不满，得按具体情况重新为其耕一次。在耕完一定数量的耕地后，站方即给该农户开一串票去，以便收获后付款。
    塔尔顿村的农民告诉我：用拖拉机耕作较马匹耕得深，所费也便宜，农民就省出了很多时间来从事文化活动。拖拉机站同时附设有图书馆，供给农民书籍，并且经常与青年联盟、工会组织共同邀请电影队和剧团到各村演出。不管部分反动富农的造谣，农户们深深地体验到国营拖拉机站所带给他们的利益。三十岁的卡尔·穆莱尔是本站的模范拖拉机驾驶员，去年当本站刚成立后的第一次收割中，他一个人用苏联制的ＫＤ３５号拖拉机十九天收割和捆打了九十八海克特麦子，这种效率；使得由他耕作的农户的收割工作及时完成。农户们送给他一个英雄的光荣称号。当我访问穆莱尔时，他说：“由于农户的土地零碎和分散（平均一块地为○·六五海克特），就使机器的转移次数多，误工多，否则他的耕作效率会更高些。”
    当我们离开办公室，到库房、修械厂去参观时，机器工人和驾驶员们都在忙着准备好机器，以便迎接即将到来的收割任务。
