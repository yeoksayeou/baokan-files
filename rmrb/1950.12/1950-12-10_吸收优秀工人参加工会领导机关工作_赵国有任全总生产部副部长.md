    Absorbing Outstanding Workers into the Leadership Organs of Trade Unions
    Zhao Guoyou Appointed Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Production Department
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Seventh Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) on the 7th passed a resolution to appoint Zhao Guoyou, a famous model worker and lathe operator from the Northeast Machinery Plant No. 3, as Deputy Director of the Production Department of the ACFTU. Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the ACFTU, pointed out at the meeting that, at present, apart from the national committees of industrial unions such as textiles and coal mines having absorbed a certain number of worker cadres who have connections with the masses of workers to work in the leading organs, the leading organs of many trade union organizations, and even the leading organs of some municipal trade unions, still completely rely on the cadres originally sent to do trade union work. They have not paid attention to absorbing outstanding worker cadres with prestige among the masses to work in the leading organs. This is one of the main reasons why trade union organizations are divorced from the masses. In order to strengthen the connection between the leading organs of the trade unions and the masses, and to improve the style of trade union work, the Standing Committee decided that in the future, it will pay attention to absorbing outstanding elements from the worker masses to participate in the work of the leading organs of trade unions at all levels in a planned way. It also instructed the industrial unions and local trade unions to recommend a certain number of worker cadres to participate in the work of the ACFTU.

    吸收优秀工人参加工会领导机关工作
    赵国有任全总生产部副部长
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会七日常委扩大会议通过选任著名劳动模范、东北机械三厂车工赵国有为中华全国总工会生产部副部长。中华全国总工会李立三副主席在会上指出，目前除纺织、煤矿等产业工会的全国委员会吸收了一定数量与工人群众有联系的工人干部到领导机关来工作外，有许多工会组织的领导机关，甚至有些市总工会的领导机关，还是完全依靠原来派去的干部做工会工作，没有注意吸收在群众中有威信的优秀工人干部到领导机关来工作，这是工会组织脱离群众的主要原因之一。为了密切工会领导机关与群众的联系，改善工会工作作风，常委会决定今后要有计划地注意吸收工人群众中的优秀分子参加各级工会领导机关工作。并责成各产业工会和各地工会推出一定数量的工人干部，参加全国总工会的工作。
