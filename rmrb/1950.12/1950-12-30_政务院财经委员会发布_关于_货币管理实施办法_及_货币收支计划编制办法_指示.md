Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council issued a directive on December 25th regarding the "Measures for Currency Management Implementation" and "Measures for Compiling Currency Revenue and Expenditure Plans." The full text is as follows:

    In order to proactively control and regulate currency circulation to consolidate finance, to enable the state-owned funds dispersed among various units to be more fully concentrated, unified, and effectively used to meet the needs of the huge funds required for national economic construction, and to promote economic accounting and the implementation of plans, the People's Bank of China, in accordance with Section 4 of the Government Administration Council's "Decision on the Final Account System, Budget Review, Investment Construction Plans, and Currency Management" regarding the principle of implementing further currency management, has formulated the "Measures for Currency Management Implementation" and "Measures for Compiling Currency Revenue and Expenditure Plans." After review by this Committee, we believe that they are in line with the spirit of the Government Administration Council's decision and are approved for trial implementation from the date of promulgation. However, the currency management system is an important link in further unifying financial and economic work and is one of the main financial and economic disciplines. Government financial committees and relevant departments at all levels must fully mobilize, vigorously organize, and implement it.
