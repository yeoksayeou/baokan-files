    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Despite severe financial difficulties, the French government of Pleven passed a massive war preparedness budget for 1951 on the 22nd. According to Agence France-Presse in Paris, the total French budget for 1951 amounts to 2,612 billion francs, an increase of 400 billion francs over 1950. Within the entire budget, the expenses for fulfilling the military obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty and the military expenditure of the Vietnam colonial war, amount to 720 billion francs, which is 44 percent more than the 1950 military budget which was successively increased to 500 billion francs; and this does not include the 860 billion francs worth of military supplies given to France by the United States under the guise of military aid. This fully demonstrates the willingness of the Pleven government to act as the vanguard of American aggression in Europe, and to prepare to launch a frenzied attack on the Vietnamese people in Asia.
    However, this budget simultaneously exposes the extreme fragility of the French war economy. Due to the rapid increase in military spending, the fiscal deficit for 1951 is as high as 547 billion francs, accounting for more than one-fifth of total expenditures. In order to make up for this staggering deficit, the Pleven government has stipulated in the budget plan to increase new taxes and raise the tax rates of existing taxes, further squeezing the vast French people whose burdens are already very heavy.

    法政府不顾严重财政困难
    通过庞大备战预算
    军事开支竟达七千余亿法郎  赤字将占全部岁出五分之一
    【新华社二十六日讯】不顾严重的财政困难，法国普利文政府已于二十二日通过一九五一年度的庞大的备战预算案。据法新社巴黎消息，法国一九五一年度预算总数达二万六千一百二十亿法郎，较一九五○年度多出四千亿法郎。在整个预算中，为负担北大西洋公约军事义务，与越南殖民战争的军事开支的费用，达七千二百亿法郎，较陆续增加达五千亿法郎的一九五○年度军事预算多百分之四十四；而美国在军援计划名义下给予法国的八千六百多亿法郎的军事物资尚不计算在内。这充分说明普利文政府甘愿在欧洲充当美国侵略的先锋，并准备在亚洲疯狂进攻越南人民的意图。
    但这一预算同时严重地暴露了法国备战经济的极度脆弱。由于军费的飞速增加，一九五一年度的财政赤字竟高达五千四百七十亿法郎，占全部岁出五分之一以上。为了弥补这种骇人听闻的赤字，普利文政府已在预算案中规定增加新税收和提高现有各种税收的税率，进一步榨取负担已十分沉重的法国广大人民。
