Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The German News Agency reports that the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, wrote a letter to the Premier of the West German Bonn government, Adenauer, on December 1st, suggesting that the two governments hold negotiations on the establishment of an All-German Constitutional Council. This suggestion has been enthusiastically supported by the working people of West Germany.

Grotewohl's letter stated: "The maintenance of peace, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the restoration of German unity depend first and foremost on the mutual understanding of the Germans themselves. We believe that such understanding is possible, and all peace-loving Germans will certainly welcome the establishment of an All-German Constitutional Council composed of representatives from East and West Germany on a common basis. This council will prepare for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, democratic, and peace-loving provisional government for all of Germany and will submit corresponding suggestions to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France for joint approval. At the same time, before the establishment of an all-German government, this council will consult with the aforementioned four governments on the drafting of a peace treaty. Under certain conditions, a plebiscite on this proposal can be held among the German people.

Grotewohl stated: The government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to conduct negotiations in a spirit of sincerity and mutual understanding on all issues related to the establishment of the All-German Constitutional Council and its tasks. He suggested that each government send six representatives to conduct these negotiations. The time and place can be agreed upon by the secretaries of the two premiers.

Premier Grotewohl's suggestion spread like lightning to the Rhineland and the Ruhr area. Workers from various industries spontaneously gathered to unanimously support this suggestion. The "Bismarck" mine union issued a declaration stating: The suggestion to establish an All-German Constitutional Council was put forward at a time when the political situation is most tense. Putting this suggestion into practice would be enough to eliminate the serious war crisis. Negotiations between representatives of East and West Germany must be realized. An engineer from Gelsenkirchen, in the British occupation zone, said: The suggestion put forward by Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic is a manifestation of the German Democratic Republic's love for peace. Now, if Adenauer refuses this suggestion, we should ensure that a movement is launched from below to force the Bonn government to accept this peace-favorable suggestion.

    民主德国总理格罗提渥致函阿登纳
    建议谈判成立全德立宪议会
    西德劳动人民普遍表示热烈支持
    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社消息：据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥，于十二月一日写信给西德波恩政府总理阿登纳，建议双方政府就成立全德立宪议会一事举行谈判，这个建议已获得西德劳动人民的热烈支持。
    格罗提渥的信中说：“和平的维持，和约的缔结以及德国统一的恢复，首先有赖于德国人自身的互相谅解，我们认为这种谅解是可能的，所有爱好和平的德国人都一定欢迎在共同的基础上，由东德和西德的代表组成全德立宪议会。这个议会将筹备成立全德主权独立的、民主的和爱好和平的临时政府，并将以相应的建议提交苏、美、英、法四国政府共同批准。同时，这个议会在成立全德政府之前与上述四国政府就起草和约一事举行协商。在一定条件之下可在德国人民中间就这个建议举行公民投票。
    格罗提渥表示：德意志民主共和国政府愿以诚恳互谅的精神，就有关成立全德立宪议会及其任务的一切问题进行谈判。并建议：两政府各派六位代表进行这项谈判。关于时间与地点，可由双方总理的秘书达成协议。
    格罗提渥总理的建议像闪电似地传到了来因州和鲁尔区。各业工人自发地集会，一致拥护这个建议。“俾斯麦克”矿厂工会发表宣言说：关于成立全德立宪议会的建议，是在政治形势最紧张的时刻提出来的，将这个建议付诸实行，就足以消除严重的战争危机。德国东部和西部代表间的谈判一定要实现。英占区盖尔逊基亨地方的一位工程师说：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥所提出的建议，是德意志民主共和国爱好和平的表现。现在如果阿登纳竟拒绝这个建议，我们应该保证从下面发动一种运动，强制波恩政府接受这个对和平有利的建议。
