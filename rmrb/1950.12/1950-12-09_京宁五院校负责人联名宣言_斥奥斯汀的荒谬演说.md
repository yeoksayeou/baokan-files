Heads of Five Universities in Beijing and Nanjing Jointly Issue Declaration Denouncing Austin's Absurd Speech

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Yifang, Li Fangxun, Li Zong'en, Chen Yuan, and Lu Zhiwei, the heads of Nanjing Ginling Women's College, University of Nanking, and Beijing Union Medical College, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Yenching University, jointly issued a declaration denouncing the absurd speech by Austin, the United States representative to the Security Council. The declaration is as follows:

Austin's absurd speech in the United Nations Security Council on November 28, which involved American-run universities in China, had no other purpose than to sow discord and insult.

Foreigners established schools in China based on unequal treaties. Regardless of the motives of the donors, the imperialists had long wanted to use this opportunity to exploit loopholes in China. Now they are blatant and brazen, yet their words are true evidence that they are admitting their guilt without being forced. Austin's words are the same old tune as Acheson's White Paper, which cannot deceive the Chinese people. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, and no matter what it says, it cannot cover up its bloody history of aggression.

    京宁五院校负责人联名宣言
    斥奥斯汀的荒谬演说
    【本报讯】南京金陵女子文理学院、金陵大学及北京协和医学院、辅仁大学、燕京大学的负责人吴贻芳、李方训、李宗恩、陈垣和陆志韦联名发表宣言，斥美国在安理会的代表奥斯汀的荒谬演说。宣言如下：
    十一月二十八日奥斯汀在联合国安理会的荒谬演说，涉及美国人在华所办高等学校，他的目的，不外乎离间，侮辱。
    外国人根据不平等条约在中国设立学校，不管捐款的人动机是什么，帝国主义者早就想利用这个机会，在中国钻缝子，现在更是明目张胆，大言不惭，可又是真凭实据不打自招了。奥斯汀的话，还是艾奇逊的白皮书的那一套，骗不了中国人。美帝国主义是中国人民的死对头，任怎么说也遮盖不了侵略的血迹。
